We made it!\nWhew... What a relief. Glad the jewel is still safe.\nHo ho! You said it, pal. It musta been our rock solid security that scared him off!\nWould you mind opening the safe just to double check?\nAaaaaaaaaah! We've been had!\nO-Out front! Guards! Turn on the searchlights!\nAha ha ha ha ha ha ha... Better luck next time, gentlemen! Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha... Excuse me, but I'm afraid I must be leaving now! We shall meet again... When the next moon is full! Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha... Ahaaaa ha ha ha ha ha ha...\nOctober 11, 3:24 PMWright & Co. Law Offices\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Get a load of this! Hey, are you listening to me!? You can clean the toilet later! This is important!\nPhoenix:\n*sigh* What are you freaking out about now?\nMaya:\nHey hee. Today will be the last time you talk to me that way!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMaya:\nWe're about to hit the big time!\nPhoenix:\n\"Big time\"? And what do you mean by \"we\"? You don't mean you and me are...?\nMaya:\nHa! Don't be silly. I'm talking about me and Pearly, of course!\nPearl:\nHello. It's a pleasure to see you again, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nPearls! You haven't changed a bit! Wait... What are you doing here anyway?\nPearl:\nHee hee. Haven't you heard, Mr. Nick? Here! Take a look at this!\nPhoenix:\n(What's this...? Some kind of poster?) Kurain Village... Isn't that...?\nMaya:\nThat's right. It's our hometown... Pearly and mine, that is.\nPhoenix:\nWhat's this about \"treasures\" from the boonies?\nMaya:\nHa ha ha. Very funny. You can laugh all you want... But you'll be singing another tune tonight!\nPhoenix:\nTonight? What about tonight?\nPearl:\nThe \"Treasures of Kurain\" exhibit doesn't actually start until next week, but... ...the promoter sent us some special VIP entry passes!\nMaya:\nThat's why I dressed up extra special today! What do you think, Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Heh. Same Maya. Different day.) This young lady here is Maya Fey... The younger sister of Mia Fey... ...My friend and mentor. I first met her two years ago... I was working on the case surrounding Mia's death, and ever since then...\nMaya:\nI've been the one who's been keeping this law office afloat from behind the scenes.\nPhoenix:\nActually that's just a cover for her true identity... In reality, she's a spirit medium, and a bit of a shady character.\nMaya:\nHey! Who are you calling \"shady\"!?\nPhoenix:\nAnd this little girl is Pearl Fey, but I usually call her \"Pearls\". She's Maya's cousin and a spirit medium in training herself.\nPearl:\nI know I'm a bit young, but I want to help in any way I can, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nKurain Village is the home of the mysterious Kurain Channelling Technique. And Maya here is the daughter of the Kurain School of Channeling's Master. ...I know it sounds ridiculous, but it's no joke. I've seen her power with my own eyes... It's the real thing alright.\nMaya:\nEarth to Nick! How long are you going to make two gorgeous women like us wait!?\nPearl:\nYes, Mr. Nick! I can't wait any longer! I want to see the exhibit!\nPhoenix:\n(*sigh* Looks like I don't get a choice here. Might as well head on out...)\nTreasure Exhibit Poster added to the Court Record.\nOctober 11, 7:18 PMLordly TailorMain Exhibition Hall\nPhoenix:\n(\"Lordly Tailor\"... The city's fanciest and most expensive department store. Treasure Exhibit, huh... I have to admit I'm pretty impressed.)\nMaya:\nWow... This is awesome!\nPhoenix:\nYeah... You can make even the cheapest junk look great... It all depends on how you display it.\nPearl:\nOh! They even have the dusty old hanging scroll that was in the Fey Manor storeroom!\nMaya:\nOh yeah, I remember scribbling on it when I was a little girl!\nPhoenix:\n(On a family heirloom...!?)\nMaya:\nSay, Nick... The person in charge of this exhibition is waiting for us in the basement warehouse.\nPhoenix:\nAlright... (I guess we should go and say hello...)\nExamine\nBlue board\nPhoenix:\nA piece of cloth with a ton of finely-written characters jammed onto it. Probably esoteric knowledge only mediums would know. ...Hmm, let's see... Here's the title in English... \"108 Ways to Save Money.\" ... I'm pretty sure the number has gone up since the last time I saw it.\nMaya:\nWell, we're always looking for new ways you know!\nPhoenix:\nBeing a medium sounds like a rough way of life...\nCushion\nPhoenix:\nWhat's with this big cushion? It's just lying around, with nothing on it.\nMaya:\nHmm... Well it must be for the greatest treasure of all!\nPhoenix:\n\"Greatest treasure\"...? Is there something like that?\nMaya:\nHuh? Why... Of course there is! Right, Pearly?\nPearl:\nOh! Um, yeah! Of course!\nMaya:\nYeah, I'll bet it would really take your breath away!\nFolding screen\nPhoenix:\nI think I remember this old folding screen here... I'm pretty sure it was an important piece of evidence... ...in that murder case that happened in Kurain Village.\nPearl:\nThis folding screen is the greatest of all the spirit channeling secrets... The Six Leaf Kurain Sacred Writings folding screen!\nPhoenix:\n(If it's so secret, why is it the most prominent thing in the exhibit?)\nUrns\nPhoenix:\nThey're just a bunch of old urns... Are these really \"treasures\", too?\nMaya:\nOf course they are! This is a \"Treasure Exhibit\", isn't it!?\nPhoenix:\nWell yeah, I guess so. ... (So all it takes to be a \"treasure\" is age? No wonder nobody like museums...)\nKurain Village diorama\nPearl:\nOh! Mystic Maya, look! I can't believe it!\nMaya:\nAh! It's so cute! It's a little diorama of Kurain Village!\nPhoenix:\n...Yeah, look at that. But somehow, it seems to reek of dreariness.\nPearl:\nOh! Mystic Maya, It's your house! It even says, \"Fey Manor\" on it!\nMaya:\nYikes! You're right! I kinda want to add \"The Famous\" in front of it!\nPhoenix:\nDon't do it, Maya. ...They might get mad.\nOctober 11Lordly TailorBasement Warehouse\nPhoenix:\n(Yup. This is a basement warehouse alright...)\nPearl:\nTh-This place is scary... I feel like a monster could jump out at any time...\nMaya:\nDon't be scared, Pearly! I'll protect you!\n???:\n...Oh... ...Mr. Wright.\nMaya:\nEeeeeeeek!! A monster! You were right!\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? A monster...?)\n???:\nGood evening. ...It's good to see you again.\nPhoenix:\nY-You... I know you...\n???:\nHa ha. Nice to see you again too, little miss.\nPearl:\nAh! H-Hello!\nMaya:\nIs she a friend of yours, Nick? ...And how do you know her, Pearly?\nAndrews:\nNice to meet you. I'm Adrian Andrews. I'm in charge of the promotion and planning for this Treasure Exhibit. I'm also responsible for the security arrangements.\nMaya:\nOh, um... N-Nice to meet you.\nPhoenix:\n(Adrian sure has changed since we last met...)\nAndrews:\nSo this is the warehouse. The really valuable exhibit items are still stored away in here.\nExamine\nSecurity camera\nPhoenix:\nIt's a security camera. It's trained on the warehouse door.\nAndrews:\nIt's set up to take a picture of anyone that enters or exits the door. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, they say.\nComputer\nPhoenix:\nThis computer... It looks like it's hooked up to the security camera above.\nMaya:\nAnd that means what?\nPhoenix:\nThe camera is set up to take a photo of anyone that goes in or out of the storeroom... Then the data from the camera gets uploaded to this computer here. That's what.\nMaya:\nI see... That's some pretty high-tech stuff.\nBig signboard\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like a part of a big signboard. All I can read on it is the \"bur\".\nMaya:\nAha! I've got it! Maybe it's supposed to say, \"Hamburger\"!\nPhoenix:\nWhy would anyone write \"Hamburger\" that big?\nMaya:\nLike, maybe for the \"World Hamburger Festival\" or something?\nPhoenix:\nI kinda doubt it.\nMaya:\nAha! I've got it! Maybe it said, \"Spaghetti\"!\nPhoenix:\n...Why are you talking about food? Oh, wait. That's normal for you. Anyway, it says, \"bur\". There's no way it could be \"Spaghetti\".\nMaya:\nWell, maybe it was a typo! It might have said, \"Spaghetti Festival\". What do you think?\nPhoenix:\nOK to me... Besides, Spaghetti is the only thing more tangled than your reasoning.\n(Step)ladder\nMaya:\nLook, a ladder!\nPhoenix:\nThat's a \"step\"-ladder.\nMaya:\nSo? What's the difference? You need to stop judging things based on narrow-minded cultural assumptions, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nR-Right... sorry. (Why do I feel like we've had this exact same conversation before somewhere...?)\nDoor to the storeroom\nPearl:\nMr. Nick, what's that big door over there?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like it's the door to the actual storeroom. I can see lots of big boxes and stuff back there.\nMaya:\nReally? Let's go in! I wanna take a look!\nAndrews:\nOh... I'm sorry! Unauthorized personnel aren't allowed in there.\nMaya:\n...Did you hear that, Nick? We're unauthorized personnel.\nPhoenix:\nWhy are you telling me that?\nAmi Fey statue\nPearl:\nMystic Maya! Take a look next to the door! That... That's Mystic Ami, right?\nAndrews:\nYes, that's a statue of the woman who invented the Kurain Channeling Technique, Ami Fey. This statue is on loan from one of the training halls of the Fey branch family. In fact, it just arrived this morning.\nAmi Fey's Golden Statue added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nWhat's that creepy-looking thing she's holding?\nMaya:\nDon't ask me! How should I know...?\nPhoenix:\n...Well, you ARE the future Master, right?\nMaya:\nMaybe so, but this is the first time I've ever seen this statue.\nAndrews:\nThat \"thing\" is the Kurain Shichishito. It's a ceremonial sword. It's not a real weapon, so the blade isn't sharp.\nMaya:\n...Aww, phooey. I wanted to cut something!\nPhoenix:\nWhy are you eyeing me for!?\nAmi Fey statue (subsequent times)\nPearl:\nMystic Maya! Take a look next to the door! That... That's Mystic Ami, right?\nAndrews:\nYes, that's a statue of the woman who invented the Kurain Channeling Technique, Ami Fey. This statue is on loan from one of the training halls of the Fey branch family. In fact, it just arrived this morning.\n\"ORGANI\" panels\nPhoenix:\nIt says \"ORGANI\".\nMaya:\nNo it doesn't, Nick! It says, \"ORGANIZE\"! You just can't see the last two letters.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, well I guess no one else could read it either, because this place is a mess.\nMaya:\nYeah. You must feel right at home, huh?\nTalk\nAdrian Andrews\nAndrews:\nIt really has been a long time, hasn't it, Mr. Wright?\nMaya:\nNick! What's going on!? Who is this woman!?\nPhoenix:\nWh-Why are you freaking out on me!? (Changed from [Wh-Why are you spazzing out on me!?] in the original release)\nMaya:\nWhat? I just thought it'd be more dramatic if I got all worked up. That's all.\nPearl:\nMystic Maya! You shouldn't let him of the hook so easily!\nPhoenix:\n(Please, Maya, don't say anything that'll needle Pearls further...)\nAndrews:\nMr. Wright was there for me when I really needed help. It... It was something that happened 7 months ago.\nPhoenix:\nYou remember, don't you? The \"Nickel Samurai\" case.\nMaya:\nNot really... I was stuck in a dark wine cellar... Did that escape your memory, Nick?\nAndrews:\nAfter that, I quit being a manager and started this job.\nPhoenix:\nWow, that's tough. I'm sorry, Ms. Andrews. If it wasn't for us...\nAndrews:\nNo! Don't say that! I'm glad the whole thing happened. Thanks to you and everyone else that was involved, I was able to change my whole life. ...I really am grateful.\nPhoenix:\n(Whew, that's a relief...)\nLordly Tailor\nPhoenix:\nI'm really impressed, Ms. Andrews. Handling a huge exhibition like this must be very tiring.\nAndrews:\nWell, Lordly Tailor is celebrating their 200th anniversary this year. The works on display in the main exhibition hall are worthy of the finest museums.\nMaya:\nWoohoo! Did you hear that, Pearly!? The finest museums!\nPearl:\nYes, I did! That's really wonderful.\nPhoenix:\nSo this basement warehouse is pretty well-protected, huh?\nAndrews:\n...Of course it is. After all, there are some priceless treasures here. The security guards are very highly trained as well...\nPhoenix:\n(That sounds good... So, what is with that face she's making...?)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nAndrews:\nI owe a great deal of thanks to that badge... ...It's the only reason that I'm still here today.\nPhoenix:\nOh, come on now. That's not true...\nMaya:\nI think what Nick means to say is, \"It wasn't thanks to the badge, it was thanks to ME!\" Tell the truth, Nick! I know that's what you were thinking!\nPhoenix:\nN-No way, Maya!\nTreasure Exhibit Poster\nAndrews:\nI wanted to do something nice for you and your friends, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nSo that's why you arranged this exhibit...?\nAndrews:\nI knew that Kurain Village was the hometown of your assistant, Maya. I thought it would be great to let the rest of the world know about it, too.\nPhoenix:\nHmm... But that's not exactly thanking me, per se, is it?\nMaya:\nMaybe, but who'd wanna see an exhibit on the \"Treasures of Phoenix Wright\"?\nPhoenix:\nI guess I can't argue with that one.\nPhoenix Wright profile\nAndrews:\nYou've certainly changed since I last saw you 7 months ago.\nPhoenix:\nR-Really?\nAndrews:\nYes, you look like you're bulked up a little.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, now that she mentions it... I guess I have gotten a little stronger...)\nMaya:\nYou're such a dork, Nick.\nAdrian Andrews profile\nAndrews:\nI've finally managed to put the events of 7 months ago behind me. I really love the work that I'm doing now... Honestly, I owe it all to you, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nOh, it was nothing.\nAndrews:\nAnd to this little girl, too.\nPearl:\nTh-Thank you for saying so!\nMaya:\n... ...I guess I wasn't much of a help, huh?\nAndrews:\nN-No, that's not true! You were ALL a big help to me!\nPhoenix:\n(She shouldn't take it so personally. It's not like she was exactly \"free\" to help...)\nAny other evidence\nPhoenix:\nUm... So what about this?\nAndrews:\nSorry I can't be of more help, but I really don't have anything to say about that.\nAny other profile\nAndrews:\nI'm sorry, I don't know as many people as I used to. So there really isn't anything I can tell you about that person.\nAfter clearing all Talk options and examining Ami Fey statue:\nAndrews:\nOh, look! It's already 8:00! Have you all eaten yet?\nPhoenix:\nUm, well actually...\nAndrews:\nI've already made a reservation at the restaurant on the 12th floor. Why don't we all dine together?\nMaya:\nOoh! I like the sound of that! \"Dine\"... It sounds so fancy!\nPearl:\nI'll have the \"Kid's Lunch\"!\nMaya:\nHa ha ha. Pearly, it's dinner, not lunch. Why don't you go for it and really eat your fill with a \"Kid's Dinner\"?\nPearl:\nOK! In that case, one \"Kid's Dinner\" for me!\nAndrews:\nHa ha. Shall we head upstairs, then?\nPhoenix:\nAfter that pleasant evening, all that remained was to wait for the exhibition's opening. It was wonderful seeing Ms. Andrews looking so happy. None of us could have imagined... ...that the very next day, something terrible would happen...\nOctober 12, 10:09 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nMaya:\nN-Nick! This is terrible! ...What the--!? You're cleaning the toilet again!? I never knew you were such a toilet freak!\nPhoenix:\nGimme a break, would you? My brain just hit the snooze button for the fifth time...\nPearl:\nUm... I'm going to turn on the TV!\nAnnouncer:\n...We've got an update on the recent treasure heist! Based on clues found at the scene of the crime, authorities have announced... that they believe it was the work of the renowned phantom thief, Mask☆DeMasque!\nPhoenix:\n...M-Masque the Mask...?\nAnnouncer:\nAccording to a spokesperson, Lordly Tailor received a threat letter some days ago. This is the fifth heist by the phantom thief, who only targets rare treasures.\nPhoenix:\nL-Lordly Tailor...!?\nMaya:\nWell, Nick!? What are you going to do!? Don't you dare go back to scrubbing the toilet!\nPhoenix:\nTreasure...? Lordly Tailor...? You don't think...!?\nMaya:\nYes! Now, get up, Nick! It was stolen! By Mask☆DeMasque! Our most valuable treasure... The Kurain Sacred Urn was STOLEN!!\nPhoenix:\nWhaaat!?\nExamine\nWindow\nPhoenix:\nThere is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. The chain is getting so rich that they brought a whole chunk of the next town over... ...and started building a huge theme park. It's going to be called \"Gatewater Land\". ...And to think that two years ago, it was just a little hotel for businessmen.\nMovie poster\nPhoenix:\nAn old movie poster. Apparently, this was the first movie that made Mia cry when she saw it, a long time ago. Maya watched it recently, and said she cried all night, too! ...Which, I guess, is why it's back up on the wall. I'll have to check it out one of these days.\nCharley the plant\nPhoenix:\nCharley. A quite decorative plant. When she was alive, Mia really loved it. She even went so far as to make it our mascot. It must be nice to be a plant, being able to just sit in the sun and photosynthesize...\nMaya:\nHey! Nick! No time for daydreaming!\nPearl:\nThat's right, Mr. Nick! No time for daydreaming!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh man. Until I find that urn, they're not gonna give me a second of peace...)\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nIt's my desk. I don't get to use it much, so the dust bunnies are starting to mount their assault. Maybe I should wipe them out with a few well-placed swipes of my cleaning rag...\nMaya:\nHey! Nick! Are you trying to make me upset!?\nPearl:\nYeah, Mr. Nick! If you're worried about the cleaning, please leave it up to me!\nPhoenix:\n(At least Pearls is good at cleaning. *sigh* Guess I'd better go find that urn...)\nBookshelf\nPhoenix:\nDifficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. ...Actually, I've neglected them for so long that they're covered in a layer of dust. I guess I should at least read them once in a while.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! This is no time for reading!\nPearl:\nYes, Mr. Nick! You can always read later!\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I won't be getting any peace and quiet to even read until I find that urn...)\nTalk\nSacred Urn\nPhoenix:\nRefresh my memory a little... What's this \"Sacred Urn\"...?\nMaya:\nIt's only the most important treasure in Kurain Village! That's all! Look! It's right here on the poster! Don't you remember what's inside? The urn contains a very important soul! Namely, the soul of Mystic Ami Fey, the founder of the Kurain Channeling Technique! Right, Pearly?\nPearl:\nAh, yes! Th-That's right!\nMaya:\n... Hold up... I thought that urn had the name \"AMI\", written on it... Now it says \"I AM\"... Hm... Any idea how that happened, Pearly?\nPearl:\nHuh!? Um, I... W-Well... Tee hee... There are some things left unsolved, wouldn't you say, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(That's right! One year ago, there was a murder in Kurain Village, Maya's hometown. The Sacred Urn... It turned out to be an important clue in that case.)\nSacred Urn added to the Court Record.\nSacred Urn (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nRefresh my memory a little... What's this \"Sacred Urn\"...?\nMaya:\nIt's only the most important treasure in Kurain Village! That's all! Look! It's right here on the poster! Don't you remember what's inside? The urn contains a very important soul! Namely, the soul of Mystic Ami Fey, the founder of the Kurain Channeling Technique! Right, Pearly?\nPearl:\nAh, yes! Th-That's right!\nMaya:\n... Hold up... I thought that urn had the name \"AMI\", written on it... Now it says \"I AM\"... Hm... Any idea how that happened, Pearly?\nPearl:\nHuh!? Um, I... W-Well... Tee hee... There are some things left unsolved, wouldn't you say, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(That's right! One year ago, there was a murder in Kurain Village, Maya's hometown. The Sacred Urn... It turned out to be an important clue in that case.)\nWhat to do\nPhoenix:\nOK, the toilet is shinier than the judge's head, so let's see what's next...\nMaya:\nWhat's wrong with you, Nick!?\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean?\nMaya:\nWhat do you mean what do I--\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Your beloved Mystic Maya's treasure has been stolen! Doesn't that ever bother you!?\nPhoenix:\nBut I thought the urn was the village's treasure, so I don't see how...\nPearl:\nThe village IS Mystic Maya! She's the future master of the Kurain School of Channeling! You know what I'm talking about, Mr. Nick! I won't let you say you don't!\nPhoenix:\nO-OK OK! I do! ...So what am I supposed to do about it?\nPearl:\nIsn't it obvious? Go and find the bad guy who did this!\nMaya:\nYeah! And get the Sacred Urn back!\nPhoenix:\nB-But... I'm not a detective... I'm a lawyer--\nPearl:\nThat has nothing to do with this! If you're a real gentlemen, you would find it for your beloved Mystic Maya!\nPhoenix:\n(Man, oh man... There's no winning against Pearls's fairy-tale image if love...) ...So what's the name of this bad guy again?\nMaya:\nMask☆DeMasque, Nick! Make a note of it! Mask☆DeMasque!\nLast year's incident (appears after \"Sacred Urn\")\nMaya:\nAh, it was terrible! I was arrested and everything!\nPhoenix:\nOne year ago... The murder in Kurain Village. A man was killed during one of Maya's spirit channelings. And this urn wound up being the key piece of evidence that proved her innocence.\nPearl:\nUm... Mr. Nick? Would you mind not telling Maya about that? You promised, remember? You said you wouldn't tell anyone I broke the urn...\nPhoenix:\nOh yeah, that's right. (Now I remember. This urn used to say \"AMI\" on it... Until Pearls accidentally broke it into a million pieces. She tried to secretly fix it... Let's just say it didn't work out so well.)\nPearl:\nSorry... I'm not so good at arts and crafts... Spelling either...\nPhoenix:\n...Anyway, this is how her gluing project turned out. She put the pieces together wrong and now, instead of \"AMI\", it says, \"I AM\". ...I can't believe no one's noticed this until now, a whole year later.\nPearl:\nI can't believe it myself...\nPresent\nMagatama\nMaya:\nOh, hey! It's my Magatama! So what do you think, Nick? Isn't it neat?\nPhoenix:\nIt sure is. Being able to peek into people's minds is definitely a nice advantage.\nMaya:\nWhat? How do you do that!?\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean? You gave me this thing...\nMaya:\nWell, I knew Pearly put some sort of spiritual power into it... But I had no idea that it let you do something as cool as that!\nPhoenix:\n...Some future leader you are.\nMaya:\nNext time you use it, let me know, OK!? I want to see into people's minds, too!\nTreasure Exhibit Poster or Sacred Urn\nPhoenix:\nIs this thing really all that valuable? It looks kinda... well... junky, if you ask me.\nMaya:\nBut it's got the soul of Mystic Ami, the founder of our channeling technique!\nPhoenix:\nSo how much do you think you could get for it?\nMaya:\nWhat!? Sell the Sacred Urn!? You know, I never thought about that... Hey Pearly... Make a note of that. \"Ways to Save Money, Tip 109: Sell treasures whenever possible.\"\nPearl:\n...Whenever possible, check!\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow, I think Maya's going to be searching for a buyer for a long time...)\nAmi Fey's Golden Statue\nMaya:\nYou know, even I didn't know this statue existed until a little while ago.\nPhoenix:\nDidn't Adrian say it's from a Fey branch family's training hall or something?\nMaya:\nYes, there are actually a lot of training halls scattered all over the country. Hidden away deep in desolate mountains...\nPhoenix:\n(Why does it always have to be \"desolate\" mountains...?)\nPhoenix Wright profile\nMaya:\nYou're not very photogenic, are you?\nPhoenix:\n...!\nPearl:\nI guess that's the end of that conversation!\nMia Fey profile\nMaya:\nS-Sis... *sniffle* I really miss her...\nPearl:\nWas Mystic Mia... Was she a really good lawyer?\nMaya:\nYeah, she was awesome! She taught Nick everything he knows.\nPearl:\nYou should train hard and try to make her proud, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, I'll do my best.\nPearl:\nYou can join me on my next trip to a freezing waterfall!\nPhoenix:\n(I hate to break it to her, but I don't think being frozen to the bone helps in court...)\nMaya Fey profile\nMaya:\nI'm going to have to really buckle down and get serious.\nPhoenix:\nWell, you're the future Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, after all.\nMaya:\nYeah... That, and I have to play the part of big sister, too. For Pearly... and you, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nWha-?? Do I look like I was born yesterday!?\nPearl Fey profile\nMaya:\nPearly is such a cutie, isn't she Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYup.\nMaya:\nAnd she's smart too, just like yours truly! She's got quite a future ahead of her! I bet she could be President some day!\nPhoenix:\n(A President that can channel past Presidents... Hmm... That just might come in handy...)\nAdrian Andrews profile\nMaya:\nShe certainly seems grateful to you, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWell, she was in a pretty tight spot during that terrible ordeal. Actually, I'm grateful to her, too.\nMaya:\nHmm... It sounds like you're not telling me something. I'm going to take a good look at the case file next chance I get...\nAny other evidence\nPhoenix:\nSo, what do you think about this?\nMaya:\nHmm... What about it, Pearly?\nPearl:\nI'm not certain. What do you think, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe three heads aren't better than one...)\nAny other profile\nPhoenix:\nSo, what do you think about this person?\nMaya:\nHmm... What do you think, Pearly?\nPearl:\nI'm not certain. What do you think, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(I think the saying I'm looking for is, \"never seen them before in my life\"...)\nOctober 12Lordly TailorMain Exhibition Hall\nPearl:\nRight! Let's see if we can find some clues that might lead us to the bad guy!\nPhoenix:\n...But it doesn't look like anything has been disturbed.\nMaya:\nYeah, it looks pretty much the same as it did last night.\nPearl:\nHmmm... Bad guy, huh.\n???:\nHey! You can't poke around here, pal!\nPhoenix:\nWait a minute... that voice. Oh no! Not him again!\n???:\nIt's YOU!! And I'm the one who should be saying \"not again\"! Why is it that every time something bad happens, you always show up, pal?\nPhoenix:\nI should be asking you that. Aren't there any other detectives?\n???:\nNo, I should be asking YOU that. What are you doing hanging around here?\nPhoenix:\nHey, I asked you first. Why are you here any--\nMaya:\nAlright, alright, we got it! Why don't you two kiss and make up already?\nPearl:\n...Um, hello. It's been a long time, Mr. Scruffy Detective!\n???:\nOh! It's you, little missy! ...Um, ahh...\nGumshoe:\nActually, my name is Gumshoe. \"Detective Dick Gumshoe\"! Now is a good chance for you to try to remember it right!\nMaya:\nAnd if it's too long for you, you can just call him \"Dick\".\nPearl:\nOkay! It's good to see you again, Mr. Detective Dick!\nGumshoe:\nUm... Yeah... Good to see you again, too, I guess.\nTalk\nWhat happened\nPearl:\nUmm, Mr. Detective Dick! Can you tell us about what happened?\nGumshoe:\nOh, you're trying to remember my name! Atta girl! ...Um, just... It's \"Gumshoe\", OK? Anyway, the thief stole something called the \"Sacred Urn\"...\nPearl:\nI know about that.\nGumshoe:\nOh. W-Well, the criminal's name is Mask☆DeMasque...\nPearl:\nI know about that, too.\nMaya:\nDetective, can't you tell us something other than that?\nGumshoe:\nW-Well... I guess I sorta kinda owe you guys... in a way... The crime occurred last night at around 1:30 in the morning.\nPhoenix:\nHow exactly do you know that?\nGumshoe:\nWe got an emergency phone call from a guard at the scene of crime, pal. He said, \"The urn was just stolen!\"\nMaya:\nThe scene of the crime... You mean here, right?\nGumshoe:\nWrong. That urn was being kept under careful guard in the basement warehouse.\nPhoenix:\n(Basement warehouse, huh...)\nPearl:\nUmm, so who was guarding the basement warehouse...?\nGumshoe:\nThat guy! It's all his fault that the thief got away, pal! He solves one case and gets a swelled head, thinking that he's an Ace Detective!\nMaya:\nA-Ace Detective...?\nMask☆DeMasque\nPhoenix:\nHey, Detective Gumshoe, about this Mask☆DeMasque... Is he famous?\nMaya:\nWhaaaat!? You're joking, right Nick? Mask☆DeMasque is the hottest thing since sliced bread!\nGumshoe:\nSometimes he appears as a museum guard! Sometimes he appears as a big brown bear known to surprise unsuspecting victims. But underneath those disguises is... the true Mask☆DeMasque!\nPhoenix:\n...So he's some kind of master of disguise, huh.\nGumshoe:\nAnd he only goes after the finest work of art, pal. Last night was his 5th heist! If Lordly Tailor had only cooperated, I could have caught him this time...\nMaya:\nWhat!? Then you knew he was planning on stealing the Sacred Urn!?\nGumshoe:\nOf course I did! The guy always sends his calling card before he steals something.\nPhoenix:\n(Calling card, huh... They mentioned that on TV...)\nAce Detective (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nSo why do you call him an \"Ace Detective\" anyway?\nGumshoe:\nThat's what he calls himself, pal... I didn't make it up.\nMaya:\nSo? What's he like?\nGumshoe:\nWell, like I told you, Mask☆DeMasque has made five heists so far. On the 4th heist, Mr. Ace Detective managed to get the stolen treasure back.\nPearl:\nWow, that is impressive! All by himself!?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. I gotta admit it, pal. Maybe he really is as good as he says. Every time the thief sends one of his calling cards, we send our men on a stakeout... But none of us has ever gotten so much as a glimpse of the guy...\nPearl:\nBut Mr. Ace Detective was able to retrieve the stolen treasure from the thief...\nGumshoe:\nAnyway, he's at the scene of crime right now, looking for clues.\nPhoenix:\n(So he's down in the basement warehouse, huh...?)\nCalling card (appears after \"Mask☆DeMasque\")\nPhoenix:\nSo what's this \"calling card\"?\nGumshoe:\nHere it is. But don't show it to anyone! It's top-secret, OK, pal?\nPhoenix:\nWhat's this mark on the front?\nGumshoe:\nThat's Mask☆DeMasque's signature emblem, pal. You could say it's his \"mark\". All of his calling cards have got it on them.\nMaya:\nThey didn't mention THAT on the news flash.\nGumshoe:\nWe're withholding that detail from the public for \"operational reasons\"... The only way we can tell if a calling card is real or not is by this emblem.\nCalling Card added to the Court Record.\nMaya:\n...That makes sense. When you get famous, there are always imitators.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick, if you work a little harder, maybe you can have your own copycats someday!\nPhoenix:\nUm, uh, thanks... I guess.\nCalling card (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nSo what's this \"calling card\"?\nGumshoe:\nHere it is. But don't show it to anyone! It's top-secret, OK, pal?\nPhoenix:\nWhat's this mark on the front?\nGumshoe:\nThat's Mask☆DeMasque's signature emblem, pal. You could say it's his \"mark\". All of his calling cards have got it on them.\nMaya:\nThey didn't mention THAT on the news flash.\nGumshoe:\nWe're withholding that detail from the public for \"operational reasons\"... The only way we can tell if a calling card is real or not is by this emblem.\nMaya:\n...That makes sense. When you get famous, there are always imitators.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick, if you work a little harder, maybe you can have your own copycats someday!\nPhoenix:\nUm, uh, thanks... I guess.\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPhoenix:\nHere, take a look at my attorney's badge.\nGumshoe:\nAre you still showing that cheap little thing off? A real man keeps his mouth shut... and carries a suave police badge, pal.\nTreasure Exhibit Poster or Sacred Urn\nGumshoe:\n...To be honest, pal, there's something that bugs me.\nPhoenix:\nWhat's that?\nGumshoe:\nAll the other items that were stolen by Mask☆DeMasque were ones even I had heard of. They were all world-famous treasures. The \"Tear of Emanon\" or the \"Crown of Bongora\"...\nMaya:\nThe \"Sacred Urn of Kurain\" is famous, too! ...Right, Pearly!?\nPearl:\nOf course! Everyone in Kurain Village knows about it!\nPhoenix:\n(Sounds like we've got an unpredictable thief on our hands...)\nDeMasque's Calling Card\nGumshoe:\nRemember! Don't tell anyone about that emblem. OK, pal?\nPhoenix:\nDoes the thief ever send these to the police?\nGumshoe:\nNo, always to the victims. Up until now, the victims have always come to us looking for help though.\nMaya:\n...That's not what happened this time, you mean?\nGumshoe:\nYou got that right, pal. Listen up! If you guys ever get one of these calling cards... ...I want you to come to us right away! Got me?\nPhoenix:\n...Yeah, sure.\nPhoenix Wright profile\nGumshoe:\nPretty goofy-looking face, if you ask me.\nPhoenix:\nHey...!\nMaya:\nWhat are you doing carrying that around with you anyway? It's not like we ever need it.\nPhoenix:\n(She has got a point...)\nMia Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nOh! That's Ms. Mia Fey! She was a truly beautiful person, pal.\nMaya:\nHuh? You knew her? You knew my sis?\nGumshoe:\nSure. Everybody in the police force knew her. ...We all lost a great friend that day...\nPearl:\nMr. Scruffy Detective...\nGumshoe:\nI-I just got something in my eye...! ...I'm not crying!\nMask☆DeMasque profile\nGumshoe:\nI've been on this guy's tail ever since his first heist, pal!\nMaya:\nYeah, you're doing a really great job. I can see.\nGumshoe:\n...Oof! Listen pal, if you wanna jump high, first you gotta crouch down, right? I'm a little frustrated now, but it'll make it that much sweeter when I catch him! ...Anyway, that's what I keep telling myself every day.\nPearl:\nWell good luck, Mr. Detective Dick! I believe in you!\nGumshoe:\nAww, ain't you sweet. You're the only one that's ever said that!\nPhoenix:\n(...The only one? That's kinda sad if you think about it.)\nAny other evidence\nPhoenix:\nUmm, what about this...?\nGumshoe:\n...Sorry, pal. I didn't get much sleep last night and my brain's not really working right.\nMaya:\nSomehow I don't think sleep would really fix the problem.\nPhoenix:\nHey, keep it down. He might have really good hearing for all you know, and might get mad if he heard.\nGumshoe:\nUmmm... I can hear everything you are saying, pal.\nAny other profile\nPhoenix:\nUmm, what about this person...?\nGumshoe:\n...Sorry, pal. I didn't get much sleep last night and my brain's not really working right.\nMaya:\nSomehow I don't think sleep would really fix the problem.\nPhoenix:\nHey, keep it down. He might have really good hearing for all you know, and might get mad if he heard.\nGumshoe:\nUmmm... I can hear everything you are saying, pal.\nAfter clearing \"What happened\" Talk option in Lordly Tailor - Main Exhibition Hall:\nOctober 12Lordly TailorBasement Warehouse\nMaya:\nNo matter how many times we come here, this place always give me the chills.\nPhoenix:\nThat's probably because it's air-conditioned... To protect the art pieces, you know.\n???:\n...Welcome! To my private little \"Banquet of Chaos\".\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? What the heck does THAT mean...?)\n???:\nI'm afraid I have very little to offer, but please... make yourself at home.\nMaya:\nErr, umm... Who are you anyway...?\n???:\nSHHH! SILENCE! ... Hee hee hee hee hee hee... Now I see! It's all becoming clear!\nMaya:\nWh-What do you see?\n???:\n...Zvarri! The truth has once again been elegantly revealed to me! A lawyer, and... a spirit medium. Neither very advanced at their trade! ...Am I wrong?\nMaya:\nYikes! Th-That's scary! H-How did you know that!?\n???:\n\"How\" you say? The universal skeptic would say that how is nothing but a question of why. I am traveler of both time and space, and a swimmer of dreams.\nMaya:\nWhat is he talking about? I can't make heads or tails of it...\n???:\nWithout further ado, let me fulfill what should be the first duty of any gentleman...\nAtmey:\n...and introduce myself. The name is Atmey... Luke Atmey! ...Ace Detective.\nPhoenix:\nOh... Umm... Hi.\nMaya:\nDon't let him intimidate you, Nick! Stand up and show him what you're made of!\nPhoenix:\nErr, umm... The name's Wright. Phoenix Wright... ...Ace Attorney.\nMaya:\nI'm Maya Fey! Ace Spirit Medium!\nPearl:\nAnd I'm, ummm... Pearl Fey. I'm Mystic Maya's cousin and umm... spirit medium Ace Apprentice.\nAtmey:\nExcellent! Well then, shall we begin our little game?\nPhoenix:\n(\"Game\"? Why does the phrase \"one short of a baker's dozen\" come to mind with this guy?)\nExamine\nAnywhere\nAtmey:\nTsk! Sir Lawyer! Please refrain from such crude behavior.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Wh-What do you mean?\nAtmey:\nThis criminal is an artist! The crime scene is the canvas upon which he paints! Only I, Ace Detective Atmey, have an eye which is educated enough to read the signs!\nMaya:\n...Could you translate that for me, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI think he pretty much said, \"Don't touch anything amateurs!\"\nAtmey:\nIf there's something you wish to know about, you have but to ask Atmey! ...I know everything there is to know about my rival, Mask☆DeMasque.\nPhoenix:\n(What do I do now...?)\nMaya:\nDoes he have any top-secret information? Stuff that only a real crime buff would know?\nPhoenix:\n(I'll think about what to ask while I listen to what Mr. Ace Detective has to say...)\nTalk\nAce Detective\nPhoenix:\nUmm... So are you really as famous as you say?\nAtmey:\nOf course! For a lawyer, you have a rather shocking lack of knowledge about the world. I had no idea anyone was left in this city that had not heard of me! Look at me! I am Mask☆DeMasque's arch-enemy, the Ace Detective Luke Atmey! At this moment, there are two mighty figures which loom large over this grand city! One embodies the nefarious forces of darkness. The other the angelic cherubs of light!\nMaya:\n...Boy, now I'm really lost. What is he saying, Nick?\nAtmey:\nI have been personally on the heels of this villain since his first crime. After learning this criminal's patterns, I thwarted his very latest loathsome larceny! I even returned the target of his tyranny, the \"Portrait of Mejeena\" to the crime scene! And I did it all by myself! I took it back from Mask☆DeMasque... With my brawny mind and my brilliant muscles!\nMaya:\nYeah! They mentioned it on the news, in the \"Great People Around Town\" segment. (Changed from [Yeah! They mentioned it on the news, in the 'Great People of the Town' segment.] in the original release) They said that the museum gave you an incredible jewel as a reward!\nAtmey:\n...Well, compared to the treasure that I retrieved for them, it's not much.\nPhoenix:\n(So... in the end, the only thing that makes you great is your own self-praise...)\nMask☆DeMasque\nMaya:\nOh! Tell us what you know about Mask☆DeMasque! ...And keep it simple, please!\nAtmey:\nLike about how I have devoted my life to thwarting his dastardly deeds? Last night, here in the bowels of this store, we were locked in a most glorious battle.\nPhoenix:\nI see... ...Huh!? Hang on a second! You were here last night? Here? In Lordly Tailor!?\nAtmey:\nNaturally! Wherever DeMasque goes, you will find Atmey laying his elegant traps.\nPhoenix:\n(Elegant traps? More like DeMasque out-eleganced you and made a beautiful getaway.)\nAtmey:\nBut this time, I allowed him to escape with the illusion of victory.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if I should ask him about what happened last night in more detail...)\nThe night of the crime (appears after \"Mask☆DeMasque\")\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Can you tell us exactly what happened here last night?\nAtmey:\nBut of course. After all, I always say there should be no secrets between \"aces\".\nPhoenix:\n(Flattery will get you nowhere, Pinocchio...)\nAtmey:\nI first received the request for my services 20 days ago. And it was 10 days ago that we received Mask☆DeMasque's calling card...\nMaya:\nHuh? You were hired BEFORE the calling card even arrived?\nAtmey:\nYes. You see, the person who hired me is quite rigorous and thorough.\nPhoenix:\n(That's Adrian for you...)\nAtmey:\nA mere 10 days after hiring me, her worst premonitions were realized!\nMaya:\nA calling card arrived, right?\nAtmey:\nYes! So, Ace Detective that I am, I set a trap for the thief right in the warehouse. And waited for him... alone.\nMaya:\nAlone? ...But why? Why didn't you go to the police for help?\nAtmey:\nRidiculous! Why would I seek help from such a singularly useless group of nincompoops?\nPhoenix:\n(You've got a lot of nerve. After all, it was you that let DeMasque get away.)\nAtmey:\nI always operate alone and concealed. Out of the sight of others.\nPearl:\n...? \"Corn Sealed\"...?\nAtmey:\nPrecisely! Even the guards on duty here were unaware of my presence. \"To fool your enemies, first you must fool your friends.\" It's my own original proverb!\nMaya:\nAnyway, back to what happened last night...\nAtmey:\nAs I was saying, I hid here in the warehouse and waited for the thief to arrive. But I swear to you... Not a solitary soul came through that entrance! Nevertheless... The Sacred Urn disappeared!\nPhoenix:\nB-But that's impossible! How could it just disappear!?\nAtmey:\n\"How?\" you ask? Don't be ridiculous, Sir Lawyer. If I knew the answer to that question, I wouldn't be here!\nPhoenix:\n(For someone who seriously messed up his own stakeout, he's rather full of himself.)\nPearl:\nSo you're saying that even though on [sic] one came through those doors last night... ...our precious urn still somehow vanished from under your nose?\nPhoenix:\n(Th-That's just not possible!)\nPresent\nTreasure Exhibit Poster or Sacred Urn\nAtmey:\nDo not fear, young lady. I promise I shall retrieve your urn!\nMaya:\nThank you, Detective Atmey! I'm counting on you!\nAtmey:\nThe final round between Detective Luke Atmey and Mask☆DeMasque is set to begin.\nPhoenix:\nStill, there's something funny about this guy...\nMaya:\nYeah, but don't forget he managed to retrieve the treasure from the last heist.\nAtmey:\nYes, I even have a video that details my role in the whole affair. I recorded it directly from the news on TV. Can I interest you in a copy?\nPhoenix:\n...No thanks.\nDeMasque's Calling Card\nPhoenix:\nMask☆DeMasque's calling card... It's got his emblem printed on it, right?\nAtmey:\n...Quite impressive! But I would expect nothing less from my arch-rival! I'm surprised to see you in possession of such a top-secret piece of information.\nMaya:\nWell, we've got an Ace Lawyer, an Ace Spirit Medium and an Ace Cousin-Apprentice here.\nAtmey:\nYes, indeed... I think I could learn to like you, my fellow ace professionals!\nPhoenix:\n(I don't know if I really want this guy to like us... ever.)\nPhoenix Wright profile\nPhoenix:\nThat's pretty amazing the way you were able to tell what I do for a living.\nAtmey:\nOh, it's elementary, my dear Wright, elementary. If you're really interested, the first clue was the hair. ...It points backward. It shows you're prepared to take on an attack. Such as from a criminal, for example. From your clothes, I knew you weren't a policeman, so I deduced you were a lawyer. After a combination of cold logic and intuition... Zvarri! Only the truth remains.\nPhoenix:\n(Wow, impressive...)\nMaya:\nOr maybe he just took a look at the attorney's badge on your lapel, genius.\nMia Fey profile\nAtmey:\nThis woman... She is a true beauty.\nPhoenix:\n...You don't say.\nAtmey:\nI would be honored if you would introduce her to me.\nPhoenix:\n...\nAtmey:\nI assure you, Sir Lawyer, that my interest is strictly professional!\nMaya:\nEww, this guy's even creepier than I thought.\nAtmey:\nI assure you, my dear, all Ace Detectives are perfect gentlemen!\nMaya Fey profile\nMaya:\nUmm... So how did you know I was a spirit medium?\nAtmey:\nOh, that was child's play. First, your hair. It's not of the type one sees every day. Both rare and enchanting... Almost... otherworldly. I thought it likely that you were either a fortune teller or a spirit medium. But I didn't quite detect the wisdom one usually sees in a fortune teller... And so... Zvarri! That left only one possibility.\nMaya:\nWell, they also have a bio about me on the Treasure Exhibit Poster...\nPearl Fey profile\nAtmey:\nAs for this child... Zvarri! Elementary school student.\nPearl:\nWow! That's right!\nAtmey:\nI can also see that you will be a middle-school student within the next few years!\nPearl:\nTh-That's incredible!\nPhoenix:\n(No doubt about it. This guy is good!)\nAtmey:\nNow you can see how I have earned my reputation as an Ace Detective.\nAdrian Andrews profile\nAtmey:\nAh, the charming young lady responsible for security, Ms. Adrian Andrews.\nMaya:\nHuh? You know her?\nAtmey:\nYes, well I should... She was the person who hired me for this job. A very intelligent woman. After all, she hired Detective Luke Atmey, did she not?\nPhoenix:\n(...I'm not entirely convinced that was an intelligent move on her part.)\nDick Gumshoe profile\nAtmey:\n...Oh, him. Yes, well I saw him earlier. That wretched detective has let the thief slip through his fingers every single time.\nMaya:\nWretched, huh...\nAtmey:\n...Now that I think about it, I wonder if they aren't working together.\nPhoenix:\nHuh...?\nAtmey:\nIf you ask me, Luke Atmey, I believe the two of them are \"co-conspirators\".\nMaya:\nIf Detective Gumshoe heard that, he'd probably cry.\nPhoenix:\nHe is a surprisingly sensitive guy...\nMask☆DeMasque profile\nAtmey:\nThis will surely be Mask☆DeMasque's final heist! Last time I came close and managed to retrieve the stolen treasure! Mark my words, this criminal of humanity will be found guilty in due time! And then I, Luke Atmey, Ace Detective, will dance with joy!\nPhoenix:\nI have no clue what you're blabbering about... But I guess I'll find out soon.\nLuke Atmey profile\nAtmey:\nThis person is... Zvarri! A great Ace Detective! Am I correct?\nPhoenix:\nUm, but I was the one asking you...\nAtmey:\nThis photo simply isn't enough information. I'm afraid I can't be absolutely certain... But the intelligence in those eyes indicates a man of deep wisdom and insight.\nMaya:\nStop messing around, Nick, and just ask him already!\nPhoenix:\nB-But this guy is scary.\nAnything else\nAtmey:\n...I'm sorry I can't be more helpful. But I have no interest save that of finding evidence against my arch-rival!\nMaya:\nNah, it's OK. Nick is just a bit of a piddling evidence hog. That's his defense style.\nAtmey:\nA \"piddling evidence hog\", you say? In that case, I'd simply be wasting my breath!\nMaya:\nYeah, I guess you're right.\nPhoenix:\nThanks, Maya. Why couldn't you have said I was a \"rival\", and not a \"piddling evidence hog\"?\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting DeMasque's Calling Card:\nAtmey:\n... ...Well, Sir Lawyer. I've been told that you too are pursuing the mysterious thief.\nPhoenix:\n...Well, I'm not sure would say that exact--\nMaya:\nThat's right! We're going to find the Sacred Urn no matter what we have to do!\nAtmey:\n...Excellent. I will trust you. I permit you to take a look around while I investigate elsewhere. If, perchance, you should discover something of value, return then to my office... My office of Earthly Delights, the \"Atmey Detective Agency\"! (Changed from [To my office of Earthly Delights, the 'Atmey Detective Agency'!] in the original release)\nMaya:\nOf-Office of Earthly D-Delights...?\nAtmey:\nWell then Sir Lawyer, if you'll excuse me, I have much to do!\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait a minute...!\nPearl:\nHe's gone.\nPhoenix:\nI don't like the idea of doing this guy's work for him.\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick. Don't worry about it. It's no big deal. Let's hurry up and investigate before he changes his mind!\nPearl:\nI wanna go to his office, too! Take me with you, OK?\nExamine\nSecurity camera\nPhoenix:\nIt's a security camera. It's trained on the big door to the storeroom. It's set up to take a photo of anyone that goes in or out.\nPearl:\nA \"se-kure-ity\" camera...?\nMaya:\nYeah, go stand in front of that door and it'll snap your photo too, Pearly.\nPearl:\nUmm... Mystic Maya... Do you think I should smile?\nMaya:\nNah. It's for criminals, so I think you should make a really scary face!\nPearl:\nL-Like this...?\nComputer\nMaya:\nHey, Pearly, do you know what this is? It's a computer!\nPearl:\nA \"kom-pu-ter\"...? Oh! I've heard of those! It has such a cute name!\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like this computer is for storing the data from the security camera. When someone comes in or out of the warehouse, the camera takes a photo of them.\nPearl:\nIt's probably the \"trap\" that the detective set up.\nMaya:\nLet's see if we can find last night's data on this thing. We might even find a photo of Mask☆DeMasque!\nPhoenix:\nHmm, let see here... (Man, I really stink at working these things...) ...\nPearl:\nWhat's wrong, Mr. Nick? You're sweating an awful lot.\nPhoenix:\n...I don't know how to pull up the photos...\nMaya:\nI had no idea you were so pathetic with high-tech stuff, Nick!\nPhoenix:\n...Yeah, well I managed to print out the camera data anyway.\nMaya:\nI guess you have to learn to crawl before you can walk, right, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, sure... Anyway, it looks like the camera only went off once last night.\nCamera Data added to the Court Record.\nComputer (subsequent times)\nMaya:\nHey, Pearly, do you know what this is? It's a computer!\nPearl:\nA \"kom-pu-ter\"...? Oh! I've heard of those! It has such a cute name!\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like this computer is for storing the data from the security camera. When someone comes in or out of the warehouse, the camera takes a photo of them.\nPearl:\nIt's probably the \"trap\" that the detective set up.\nWooden box\nPhoenix:\nThat pathetic-looking wooden box...\nMaya:\nAhh!! That's the box that had the Sacred Urn on it!\nPhoenix:\nDon't touch it! There may be clues to the thief's identity on there!\nMaya:\nGrr... I worked so hard to make that box!\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? You MADE that poor excuse for a box, Maya?\nMaya:\nWhat's that supposed to mean!?\nPearl:\nThat urn has always been on its stand in the Winding Way of Fey Manor. So there was no box suitable for it, Mr. Nick.\nMaya:\nAnd I-I was so proud of it... *sniffle sniffle*\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Maya. Maybe it'd have been better if Mask☆DeMasque had taken the box, too...)\nShichishito\nMaya:\nWow, this is awesome. What did Ms. Andrews say it was called again?\nPhoenix:\n\"Shichishito\". It's literally \"7 Branch Sword\" in Japanese. Or so says Ms. Andrews. Whoa... It's pretty heavy.\nMaya:\n\"One hit, seven times the fun!\" Pretty catchy, huh? I bet it'd sell like hotcakes!\nPearl:\nUm, there's something about it that bothers me...\nMaya:\nWow! You're really firing on all cylinders today, Pearly!\nPearl:\nThis sword... Wasn't Mystic Ami holding it last night?\nMaya:\nAh...\nPearl:\nAnd another thing... The sword wasn't bent last night like it is now.\nPhoenix:\nY-You're right...\nMaya:\nAwesome, Pearly! I wouldn't expect any less from my little Ace Apprentice!\nPhoenix:\n(The sword is bent, so that must mean... Last night, someone \"used it\" somehow...)\nMaya:\nAha. I just thought of something! Maybe Detective Atmey smashed Mask☆DeMasque with it. Like this!\nPhoenix:\nYEOOOOOUCCCH!! WHAT THE HECK!\nMaya:\nWhat do you think, Pearly?\nPearl:\nI think it's even more bent than it was before.\nPhoenix:\n(Oh man... My head... MY HAIR!)\nShichishito added to the Court Record.\nShichishito (subsequent times)\nMaya:\nWow, this is awesome. What did Ms. Andrews say it was called again?\nPhoenix:\n\"Shichishito\".

MY HAIR!)\nDoor to the storeroom\nPearl:\nMr. Nick, what's that big door over there?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like it's the door to the actual storeroom. I can see lots of big boxes and stuff back there.\nMaya:\nI guess that's where they were keeping the Sacred Urn.\nPhoenix:\nRemember, Maya. Ms. Andrews said we're not allowed in there.\nSpilled paint\nMaya:\nLook what you did, Nick! You spilled paint over here!\nPhoenix:\nI didn't do that!\nMaya:\nWell it wasn't here last night. I would have noticed a color this outrageous.\nPearl:\nBut this paint has already dried up.\nMaya:\nWell then, you should have cleaned it up before it dried, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nPaint doesn't dry that fast! Besides, I told you it wasn't me! (It looks like it's been several days since it was spilt.) Hey, look at this!\nPearl:\nWhat is it?\nPhoenix:\nThere's some kind of shape left in the bottom left side of this stain.\nMaya:\nHuh? ...You're right. I wonder what it could be...?\nAmi Fey statue\nMaya:\nThis statue of Mystic Ami is sooo cool. I want a gold statue of myself! We could put it in the office!\nPhoenix:\nHey! It's WRIGHT & Co.! How about a gold statue of ME?\nPearl:\nUm, Mr. Nick? I'm sorry, but I noticed something strange...\nPhoenix:\nHuh? What is it, Pearls?\nPearl:\nThe statue of Mystic Ami... Was this where it was last night?\nMaya:\nAh...\nPearl:\nI'm pretty sure it was closer to the door...\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, I think you're right.\nMaya:\nGreat job, Pearly!

That stuck-up detective's met his match! Yup! I finally caught him! Lock, stock and barrel! There's no escape for him!\nMaya:\nYou \"caught him\"? ...Are you saying...? You... You captured Mask☆DeMasque!?\nGumshoe:\nBingoooo! Well... Actually, he surrendered... ...But I still got him!\nPhoenix:\n(Mask☆DeMasque surrendered?)\nPearl:\nThat's great! So when can we come and pick up the Sacred Urn?\nGumshoe:\nUm, ahh, well ya see... I was gonna tell you...\nPhoenix:\nWhat...? Something wrong?\nGumshoe:\nDo you think you can swing by the detention center sometime?\nPhoenix:\nThe detention center...? (Changed from [Detention center...?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nHe wants to talk to you... Mask☆DeMasque, that is.\nMaya:\nWhaaaat!? He wants to talk to Nick?\nGumshoe:\nI'll be waiting for you, pal. So get over here soon.\nPhone:\n...*beep*...\nPhoenix:\n(The detention center, huh?)\nOctober 12Atmey Detective Agency\nPhoenix:\nThis is a detective agency? Looks like more like the set of some B-grade horror movie.\nMaya:\nH-Hello? Is anyone here...?\n...\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like nobody's home.\nMaya:\nHmph. What a waste of time. Hey! I know! Let's take that framed picture back with us as a memento!\nPhoenix:\nDon't you dare, Maya! (Guess we'll have to try back later...)\nExamine\nGramophone\nMaya:\nHey, Nick. What's this thing here?\nPhoenix:\nIt's called a \"gramophone\". In the old days, people used them to listen to music.\nMaya:\nYou can't be serious! I think it's probably for purifying the air or something. I'll bet you 50 cents! Come on, what do you say?\nPhoenix:\nForget it. You never pay up when you lose.\nLuke Atmey painting\nPhoenix:\nWhat a creepy painting. It's like he's looking right at me.\nMaya:\nMaybe we should put up a big portrait of you in the office, Nick! I can even paint it for you. Maybe you can pose while cleaning the toilet?\nPhoenix:\n...I think I'd prefer something a bit more dignified.\nFireplace\nMaya:\nWhoa! It's a huge hearth!\nPhoenix:\nThat's a fireplace.\nMaya:\nSo? What's the difference? You need to stop judging things based on narrow-minded cultural assumptions, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nR-Right... sorry.\nBookshelf\nPhoenix:\nThat's one impressive bookshelf filled with some very impressive books!\nMaya:\n\"My Life as an Ace Detective: Unabridged Edition\" by Luke Atmey, Ace Detective.\nPhoenix:\nHey, he's even got one of those ships in a bottle thingies.\nMaya:\nAh! Would you look at that! There's a little Luke Atmey doll at the helm! How cute!\nPhoenix:\nThere's a microscope here, too. I wonder if he was researching something. The glass slides have different names on them.\nMaya:\nThis one says... \"Atmey Virus\", ...Hmm. This guy is just dying to make a name for himself, huh.\nPhoenix:\nIt's getting kind of irritating, actually.\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nThis desk is literally covered with all sorts of chemistry equipment.\nMaya:\nOh, I just love chemistry! Say, Nick, I bet you didn't know this, but... Water is made up of carbon and hydrogen!\nPhoenix:\nNo, no, no. Not carbon! Oxygen! Oxygen and hydrogen!\nMaya:\nOh? Well, there are always alternative theories, I guess.\nPhoenix:\n(If by \"alternative theories\" you mean the ones you make up inside that head of yours.)\nOctober 12\nDetention CenterVisitor's Room\nGumshoe:\nHey, pal! Welcome to the detention center!\nPhoenix:\nYou're sure in a happy mood, aren't you?\nGumshoe:\nYup. After all, we got Mask☆DeMasq--\nMaya:\nRight, but... Um... So where's the Sacred Urn?\nGumshoe:\nOh, Sorry about that, pal... I guess I didn't really think about it before... But you're the \"victim\" in this case.\nMaya:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nWell, I guess I should let you guys hear the story straight from the horse's mouth.\nMaya:\nYou know, he's right, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nHe is?\nMaya:\nIf you think about it reeeeal hard, we are the victims!\nPhoenix:\nWell... I guess so... In a way...\n???:\nUmm...\nMaya:\nI'm so used to thinking of the victim as a dead person 'cause we're always on murder cases.\n???:\nEx-Excuse me...\nMaya:\nBut anyway! I have to get the Sacred Urn back!\n???:\nPleeeeease! Don't just ignore meeeeee! ...Err.\nMaya:\n...Um, who are you?\n???:\n...I, err, umm. I-I-I... I-I'm Ma-Ma-Ma... Mask☆DeMasque...? ...O-OK?\nMaya:\n... Hey, Nick... Doesn't he look kind of... well, gangly?\nRon:\nI'm Ron DeLite... Th-The famous Mask☆DeMasque.\nPhoenix:\n(...I don't think this guy could punch his way out of a wet paper bag.)\nExamine\nSecurity camera\nPhoenix:\nSmile, you're on candid camera.\nSecurity guard\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room. He looks nervous being this close to an alleged thief.\nTalk\nMask☆DeMasque\nPhoenix:\nSo, you're the Masque DeMask guy?\nRon:\nY-Yes! You bet! ... No... Err, that's wrong. You see... it's complicated. Sort of yes, and sort of no. If you know what I mean\nPearl:\nHm? What's wrong?\nRon:\nWell when I say \"wrong\", what I really mean to say is that it's \"not right\", per se. You see it's not spelled \"Masque DeMask\", it's actually \"Mask☆DeMasque\"...\nMaya:\n...What's with this guy?\nPhoenix:\n(Well, he's a timid little weakling, we know that much.)\nRon:\nD-Don't do that... Don't look at me like that! I don't need your pityyyyy!\nPhoenix:\n(And a major crybaby, too.) So... Why did you give yourself up?\nRon:\nWell, you see... It's because... Well...\nMaya:\nI know why! It's because you stole such a priceless treasure! And now you're overwhelmed with guilt. Am I right!?\nPhoenix:\n(\"Priceless treasure\"? That broken old urn...?)\nRon:\nUmm... I have a little favor to ask...\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes? What is it?\nRon:\nCould you... go and talk to Dessie?\nMaya:\n...D-Dessie?\nSacred Urn\nMaya:\nLook, we really want our urn back, so where is it?\nRon:\nI'm sorry! I'll give it back! I really will! ...Err, maybe not. No, I can't... I can't make promises I can't keep... I'll just end up hurting people\nPearl:\nUm, Mr. Nick...? I couldn't hear what he just said... Especially the last part.\nPhoenix:\nUm, Mr. DeMasque? Do you think you could speak up a little?\nRon:\nY-Y-Y-Yes, sir! I will... I promise! ...Err, maybe not. You see, I'm already speaking in my normal voice, so I really can't do anything\nMaya:\nMr. DeMasque? About the urn...\nRon:\nOh! Yes! The urn! Right away! ...Err, actually no. I wouldn't mind telling you, but actually I'm afraid you wouldn't believe me anyway\nMaya:\nEnough already! Just tell it to us straight!\nRon:\nPlease... Please don't yell at meeee! *huff huff huff* I... I... I'm sorry... That urn... I... I-I lost it!\nMaya:\nWh-Wha-What!?\nLost it? (appears after \"Sacred Urn\")\nPhoenix:\nWhat did you just say? Did you say you \"lost it\"?\nRon:\nYes... Er, no. Umm... Maybe so. I mean, yes, I lost it!\nMaya:\nWh-What do you mean...?\nRon:\nWell, you know... I lost it, like I said... These things just happen... You're on the train and you get distracted and you forgot your bag. You know...\nMaya:\nWhat!? You forgot our Sacred Urn on a train!?\nPhoenix:\nWait a minute! You went on the train dressed like that!?\nRon:\nN-No! I... I... I was just speaking hypothetically, that's all. A-Anyway... I'm sooooorry! I just lost it somewhere! I don't know where!\nPhoenix:\n... (This guy's story is more surreal than a Dali painting.)\nMaya:\nAre you really sure this creep is Mask☆DeMasque?\nPhoenix:\nMaya, don't call him a \"creep\". (Although I do have to admit, I understand your doubts about this guy...)\nDessie (appears after \"Mask☆DeMasque\")\nPhoenix:\nSo who is this Dessie person?\nRon:\n...! Pleeeease don't talk about my wife like that!\nMaya:\n...I-I guess she must be his wife...\nRon:\n*huff huff huff* I'm sorry! The truth is... It was my wife that told me to have you all come here... Um... Do you think you could go and visit her at my hideout?\nPhoenix:\nH... Hideout?\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! What does he mean by \"hideout\"...?\nRon:\nOh, sorry. Naturally, I meant to say my \"secret base\".\nPhoenix:\nS-Secret base?\nRon:\nWell, my apartment actually. Palazzo Pelpepe, 3rd floor...\nMaya:\nLet's go have a look, Nick! To Mask☆DeMasque's hideout!\nPhoenix:\n(Something tells me she just likes the sound of the word \"hideout\".)\nPresent\nTreasure Exhibit Poster or Sacred Urn\nRon:\nI'm really sorry I caused so much trouble.\nMaya:\nIf you're so sorry, then you shouldn't have stolen it in the first place!\nRon:\nB-But... The only thing I did wrong was lose it! ...Err, that's not right. I was wrong either way. I'm sure the owners of the other treasures fell the same\nMaya:\n...He sure seems sorry.\nPearl:\nWho would have imagined that such a famous thief would have such a pure heart...\nDeMasque's Calling Card\nRon:\nOh! That's Mask☆DeMasque's calling card! Pretty nice-looking, huh!?\nMaya:\nHe looks so happy...\nRon:\nI'm not very good at writing, you see... So I bought a book called \"How to Write Business Letters\" and studied hard!\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I guess you could call thievery a type of business...)\nMask☆DeMasque profile\nRon:\nEver since I was a little boy, I've always been interested in mysterious masked men!\nPhoenix:\nSo that's what you wanted to be when you grew up?\nRon:\nYes! ...Err, no. Sort of, but not exactly... I never imagined I'd feel as bad as I do now about the treasures being stolen...\nPhoenix:\n(...People sure can be complicated, can't they.)\nLuke Atmey profile\nRon:\nH-Him...!\nPhoenix:\nDo you know him? He claims to be your arch-enemy and rival.\nRon:\nTh-That person... He... He's not my arch-enemy OR my rival! ...Well, actually, no. Now that I think about it, the terms arch-enemy and rival are the same thing\nMaya:\nThey ARE rivals! Only people who have it out for each other would disagree like this!\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you think about this?\nRon:\nHmm... I don't really think I can help you with that. Err, no, that's not it... Well... The thing is... I don't really know if I can say one way or the other\nMaya:\nI didn't really catch that.\nPhoenix:\nDon't worry, you didn't miss anything.\nAfter clearing \"Dessie\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room:\nOctober 12\nMask☆DeMasque's Hideout\nPhoenix:\n... Wow, check this place out!\nMaya:\nNo doubt about it, this is Mask☆DeMasque's hideout alright.\n???:\nWho is it? Is that you, Ronnie? Huh? Who are you people?\nPhoenix:\nErr, umm... Are you \"Dessie\" DeLite? (Changed from [Err, umm... Are you Desirée DeLite?] in the original release)\nDesirée:\nThat's right. I'm Desirée. ... Ah! Oh! You must be the lawyer... and the victim!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, that's us. Your husband told us to stop by and speak with you. (Changed from [Y-Yeah, that's us. Your husband told us that you wanted us to stop by.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nI'm Maya Fey, and this is Phoenix Wright, attorney at law.\nDesirée:\n\"Nicky boy\" and Maya, huh? I can't tell you how grateful I am that you decided to help my Ronnie.\nMaya:\nWell, um... Aha ha... You're welcome.\nPhoenix:\n(Did she really call me \"Nicky boy\"?)\nExamine\nHot air balloon\nMaya:\nOh, that's so cute! It's called a hot air balloon, you know!\nPhoenix:\n...Wow! There's no fooling you!\nMaya:\nI want to make my own balloon now! I'll even let you ride in it, Nick!\nPhoenix:\n(That emblem on the balloon is supposed to be top-secret. That's proof enough that Ron DeLite really is Mask☆DeMasque. I'd better not tell Maya. She gets kinda... scary when it comes to \"celebrities\"...)\nPiled stuff on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a whole bunch of stuff piled up over here.\nMaya:\nDuck and cover! It-It's a missile! Did you know there's d-dynamite in missiles!?\nPhoenix:\nBut they're not heavy enough to be real... Oh wait. They're just really well-made toys.\nMaya:\nWhat are these rolls of paper stuck in the trash can? \"Theft of the Mazarin Stone: The Great Albatross Strategy\" \"Theft of the Immortal Goddess Statue: The Great Knucklebomber Strategy\"\nPhoenix:\n... (Did the police even investigate this place...?)\nGreen envelope\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Look on top of the chair!\nPhoenix:\nLooks like an envelope... And a letter.\nMaya:\nWell, don't just stand there! Come on, let's read it!\nPhoenix:\nMaya, you know we shouldn't do that!\nMaya:\nWhat are you talking about? That letter could be an important clue!\nPhoenix:\nNo way. You can't just go reading a private letter because you feel like it.\nMaya:\n...Hmph! It's not just because I \"feel like it\". It really could be important!\nPhoenix:\n(If I was sure it was a clue, I guess I wouldn't mind...)\nMasks and beard\nPhoenix:\nIt's a bunch of cheap costume pieces arranged inside a nice frame.\nMaya:\nL-Look, Nick! It's a fake beard!\nPhoenix:\nThere's also a mask made out of cardboard...\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Try on this fake beard! Come on! Try it on!\nPhoenix:\nH-Hey! Cut it out...\nMaya:\nNow put on the mask! ... Aha ha ha ha ha ha! It's Phoenix☆DeMasque! Let's borrow it for a while.\nPhoenix:\n(No way! I'm not stealing from a thief! I have enough bad karma as is!)\nHelmet and transceiver\nPhoenix:\n(Hmmm... This thing looks vaguely familiar.)\nMaya:\nOh, I know! It's a fishbowl! Well, an upside-down one, anyway...\nPhoenix:\nI think it's a helmet. ...An alien helmet.\nMaya:\nAnd that looks like a tape recorder or something next to it.\nPhoenix:\nI think it's a transceiver. ...An alien transceiver.\nMaya:\nNick... Do you think maybe you could act like a grown-up for a little bit?\nPhoenix:\n(Getting lectured by Maya to be more of an adult. That's a new low...)\nMask☆DeMasque model\nMaya:\nIt's Mask☆DeMasque!\nPhoenix:\nThere's a tape recorder hanging from his neck.\nMaya:\nLet me see that!\n...click...\nDeMasque:\nAha ha ha ha ha ha ha... I'll be taking this crown now! Better luck next time, gentlemen! Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha...\nMaya:\n... I don't get it... What's this supposed to be, Nick?\nTorpedo\nMaya:\nNick! It-It's a torpedo!\nPhoenix:\n...It's hard to believe, but it sure looks real.\nMaya:\nWhere could he have picked up something like this?\nPhoenix:\nPlease don't say that torpedoes are things people just leave lying around.\nBooks\nPhoenix:\nThere are a bunch of books lying here. They're all romantic-sounding novels about famous heists and fantastic thieves.\nMaya:\nWow! Look at all the bookmarks and notes stuck into them!\nPhoenix:\nLet's see here... \"Note: Must remember this thief's way of laughing. Very useful.\" \"Note: A calling card is an important part of any good thief's modus operandi!\"\nMaya:\n...\nPhoenix:\nW-Wow, Ron really studied his stuff!\nTalk\nRon DeLite\nPhoenix:\nUmm, about your husband...\nDesirée:\nHee hee, isn't he cutest? A bit weak sometimes though...\nPhoenix:\n...\"A bit\"?\nDesirée:\nBy the way, did you know they mentioned Maya on TV?\nMaya:\nHuh? Really!?\nDesirée:\nThey said you own the urn and that you're doing some shady training at a law office now.\nPhoenix:\n(Remind me not to watch that channel's news program.)\nDesirée:\nAfter I saw that, I thought it might be a good idea to meet the lawyer they mentioned.\nPhoenix:\n...I see.\nDesirée:\nMy Ronnie... He has a powerful imagination and gets deluded easily. He kept insisting he was going to surrender to the police. I didn't know what to do! \"It was me! I stole that urn!\" he kept saying! As if it was even possible!\nMaya:\nHuh...? B-But... Are you saying he didn't?\nDesirée:\nHa ha ha. Of course he didn't! Why would my Ronnie ever do something like that?\nMaya:\nW-Well, you know... It's a p-priceless treasure! And-And he's... You know...\nPhoenix:\n(...Is it possible his own wife doesn't know his secret identity?)\nDesirée DeLite\nDesirée:\nMe? I'm the kind of woman that needs excitement in her life!\nMaya:\nOh... Excitement, huh?\nDesirée:\nYes. I'm at my happiest when I'm racing along with my bike going at full throttle. Riding a motorcycle is like putting your life on the line. You know what I mean?\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I think that depends on how you ride it...)\nDesirée:\nI'm the type that can't stand living a boring, dreary old life with no action.\nMaya:\nNo offense, but your husband, Ron, doesn't exactly look like the risk-taking type himself.\nDesirée:\nYou're right about that. He's definitely not one for thrills and danger. But I do have to say that he makes up for it in other ways.\nPhoenix:\nOther ways...?\nDesirée:\nYes, money... Ronnie is incredibly rich... And super generous. He bought me a bike that's so fast it would make your head spin. And shopping? I like to shop so much it makes Ron's head spin. The other day, it actually happened. His head actually started to spin.\nPhoenix:\n(Man, talk about a high maintenance wife...)\nMaya:\nSo where does Mr. DeLite get all this money from?\nDesirée:\nRonnie is a security guard. They put their lives on the line, right? So they get paid tons of money in return. Tons of it.\nPhoenix:\n(He's a security guard...? I think it's my turn for my head to spin...)\nThe night of the crime (appears after \"Desirée DeLite\")\nPhoenix:\nCan you tell us about what happened last night?\nDesirée:\nHmm, what time did that incident take place again?\nPhoenix:\nWhat time was it again, Maya?\nMaya:\nWell, according to Detective Gumshoe, it was around 1:30 in the morning.\nDesirée:\nAh, last night was horrible. I got pulled over!\nMaya:\nP-Pulled over?\nDesirée:\nYes... I always do my best flying at night!\nPhoenix:\n\"Flying\"...? Um, you're talking about your motorcycle, right?\nDesirée:\nYes. Anyway, last night I got pulled over. By a policeman. I can't believe he caught up to me! It was a great chase, let me tell you! When he finally caught me, the poor man was as white as a sheet. It was about three in the morning when I finally got home.\nPhoenix:\n(Sounds like she's got an airtight alibi...)\nMaya:\nWell, what about Mr. DeLite?\nDesirée:\nI don't really know... We weren't together at that time of the night. But when I got home, he was already fast asleep.\nPhoenix:\n(So basically he's got no alibi...)\nDelusions (appears after presenting Mask☆DeMasque profile)\nPhoenix:\nSo... When did Ron first become Mask☆DeMasque?\nDesirée:\nWhat are you talking about? He's not Mask☆DeMasque!\nPhoenix:\nHuh? But... W-Wait a second! Look around at this room! This place is obviously Mask☆DeMasque's hideout...\nDesirée:\nNo no, you're totally wrong. A real thief's hideout wouldn't look like this! It's because Ronnie is so timid himself that he looks up to heroic figures.\nMaya:\nHeroic figures? But Mask☆DeMasque is a bad guy.\nPhoenix:\n(So he's \"deluded\", huh... Could that really be true?)\nDesirée:\nAnyway, if he really had stolen the urn, wouldn't he still have it?\nPhoenix:\nW-Well, I suppose so...\nDesirée:\nThen why don't you ask him if he has the urn or not?\nPhoenix:\n(She has a point. Mr. DeLite isn't exactly the criminal type... But something about Ron's behavior bothers me.)\nMaya:\nMaybe it's true... Maybe Mr. DeLite isn't Mask☆DeMasque after all.\nPresent\nTreasure Exhibit Poster, Ami Fey's Golden Statue, Sacred Urn, or Shichishito\nDesirée:\nOoh! That's so mysterious looking... I love old stuff like this!\nMaya:\nReally!? That's one of our most treasured possessions! There's going to be a whole exhibit at Lordly Tailor with these types of things!\nPhoenix:\n(Maya looks so happy. She's lit up like a 1,000 watt bulb.)\nDesirée:\nTerrific! You can count on Ronnie and me to be there! Sounds like fun!\nMaya:\nHuh! ...Oh, err, yeah... Ha ha ha...\nPhoenix:\n(Oops, looks like that light bulb is starting to flicker.)\nDeMasque's Calling Card\nPhoenix:\nUmm, so what do you know about this...?\nMaya:\nNo! You can't show her that, Nick! That emblem is top-secret! Don't you remember!?\nPhoenix:\n...Doh! Oops, sorry about that. (But the way she just said \"top-secret\" was a worse giveaway than what I did...)\nDesirée:\nOoh! When I hear the word \"top-secret\", it just piques my interest like nothing else!\nPhoenix Wright profile\nDesirée:\nSo, Nicky boy, you're a lawyer, huh?\nPhoenix:\nWell, yeah.\nDesirée:\nHow do you like it? I bet it's SO exciting!\nPhoenix:\n...Yeah, sometimes. Actually, a little too exciting at times.\nDesirée:\nOooh! I just love a good thrill. Hmm... Nicky boy... It sounds like you have it so nice...\nPhoenix:\n(Um... This is starting to get awkward.)\nMaya Fey profile\nDesirée:\nThat's really amazing! A \"Master\" at your age!\nMaya:\nOh no, you've got it wrong. It's my mother that's the current Master!\nDesirée:\nOh, I see... So what exactly is she the master of anyway?\nMaya:\nWell, you see, it's li-\nPhoenix:\nDon't say it, Maya. If you say \"spirit channeling\", she'll laugh.\nMaya:\nOuch... That hurt.\nMask☆DeMasque profile\nPhoenix:\n...Um, Ms. DeLite. You must know, right? About your husband and Mask☆DeMasque...\nDesirée:\nMask☆DeMasque? Of course. I know all about it. My husband is his biggest fan.\nMaya:\nYup... Wha...? ...Huh?\nPhoenix:\nB-Biggest fan?\nDesirée:\nYes, and Ronnie can be pretty delusional sometimes. That's how this whole misunderstanding happened.\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait a minute! Did you say \"delusional\"!?\nDesirée:\nYes, that's right. I just don't know what I'm going to do with him... You see, Ronnie actually believes that HE is Mask☆DeMasque!\nMaya:\nWH-WHAAAAT!? What are you talking about!?\nRon DeLite profile\nDesirée:\nI know he doesn't look it... But he can really get things done when he puts his mind to it.\nMaya:\nReally? So when exactly does he put his mind to it?\nDesirée:\n...Well. Not very often, I admit.\nPhoenix:\n(What exactly does Ms. DeLite see in her husband anyway?)\nMaya:\nWow, you must've really seen skyrockets when you first met to love him so much!\nPhoenix:\nSkyrockets...? I didn't know people still used that word.\nDesirée DeLite profile\nDesirée:\nAs long as I've got my motorcycle and my Ronnie, I'm happy.\nMaya:\nOh! That's so sweet!\nDesirée:\nOh, that plus a little excitement and a little shopping money! ...THEN I'm happy.\nMaya:\nNow she's starting to sound a bit greedy... Don't you think, Nick?\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nExcuse me, but would you take a look at this...?\nDesirée:\nOh, I'm sorry... I haven't the faintest idea. I guess I just don't get out enough.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nDesirée:\nSay... Can I ask you something, Nicky boy?\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it?\nDesirée:\nI know I may seem like a \"bad girl\" on the outside... But the one thing I won't stand for is illegal activity.\nMaya:\nI had the feeling you wouldn't! You're tough... But I can tell you've got a good heart. (Changed from [I had the feeling you didn't! You're tough... But I can tell you've got a good heart.] in the original release)\nDesirée:\nSomebody framed my poor Ronnie, I just know it. Umm... Could you give this to Ronnie for me?\nMaya:\nA letter?\nDesirée:\nYes, for Ronnie. I want him to fight back.\nMaya:\nMs. DeLite... OK, you've got it! Just relax and leave it all to us!\nDesirée's Letter added to the Court Record.\nPresent\nDesirée's Letter\nDesirée:\nCould you please give that to my Ronnie? The contents are very important.\nPhoenix:\n(*sigh* Back to the detention center I go...)\nDetention Center\nPresent\nDesirée DeLite profile\nRon:\nThat's my lovely wife! Isn't she beautiful?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, she sure is...\nPearl:\n... *glare*\nPhoenix:\n(Whoo boy. The one topic I didn't want to get into in front of Pearls...)\nRon:\nBut... Dessie doesn't approve of my... \"interests\". So I'm afraid she doesn't like me anymore... What should I do? If I want to win her back, I'm really going to have to be super honest.\nPhoenix:\n(Oh boy. he's gone back into his own little world again...)\nDesirée's Letter\nPhoenix:\n...Oh, that's right! Here. This is from your wife.\nRon:\nOh? From Dessie!? Thank you!\nLetter given to Mask☆DeMasque. ... Actually, more like \"taken\".\nRon:\n\"My dear Ronnie, how are you? I'm doing fine...\" ...\nPhoenix:\n(He's clutching onto that letter so hard, the ink is going to be squeezed out...)\nMaya:\nHe looks so happy...\nPearl:\nYou should write a letter to Mystic Maya too, Mr. Nick!\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Desirée's Letter:\nRon:\n... Umm... Mr. Lawyer?\nPhoenix:\nYes?\nRon:\nIn the letter that Dessie wrote, she said... \"Ask this guy to be your lawyer!\"\nMaya:\nHuh...?\nRon:\nErr, umm... I know this would be asking a lot, but... Could you please take my case? My trial starts tomorrow...\nMaya:\nHey, hang on a second! He can't be your lawyer!\nPhoenix:\nWhy not?\nMaya:\nWhat do you mean, \"why not\"!? We're the victims in this case, right!? Victims of this DeMasque guy!\nPhoenix:\nWell, yeah... But according to Desirée, he didn't do it...\nPearl:\nShe said, \"Poor man, he's deluded himself into thinking he did it.\" Right, Mr. Nick?\nMaya:\nCome on! She could be lying to protect her husband!\nPhoenix:\nW-Well, that's true. ...Err, no actually not. Actually it's hard to say (...Oh no, it's spreading!)\nRon:\nOh, please! I'll give you the treasure of your choice in return...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... What should I do?)\nTake his case\nPhoenix:\n...Well, Mr. DeLite, I've decided to give it a try. I'll defend you.\nRon:\nReally? You will?\nMaya:\nHey! What're you doing, Nick!?\nPearl:\nHe... He's a thief! You can't trust him!\nPhoenix:\nWell, he may be a thief... But I think there's more to this case than meets the eye.\nLeads to:\n\"M-Mr. Nick...! I-I was wrong about you... I shouldn't have trusted you!\"\nRefuse his case\nMaya:\nDon't do it, Nick! He's a thief!\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! I agree with Mystic Maya!\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I admit something about this guy stinks like last week's sushi. I guess I really should say no. But... If I do that, this poor guy will have nobody on his side!) ...Well, Mr. DeLite, I've decided to take your case.\nRon:\nReally? You will?\nLeads to:\n\"M-Mr. Nick...! I-I was wrong about you... I shouldn't have trusted you!\"\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick...! I-I was wrong about you... I shouldn't have trusted you!\nPhoenix:\nP-Pearls...?\nPearl:\nI can't believe you'd defend this person after what he did to Mystic Maya...! I-I... I'll never forgive you... EVER! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!\nMaya:\nP-! Pearly...! Wait!\nPhoenix:\n(This is going to be ugly...)\nMaya:\nI-I'll go after her!\nRon:\nUmm... Sorry about that. I didn't mean to cause any trouble...\nPhoenix:\nWell... You couldn't have known she'd react like that. (I guess I might as well start investigating...) Oh, Maya... Where's Pearls?\nMaya:\nShe said she's going back to the office. Go check in on her later, would you?\nPhoenix:\nAnd what about you...? Are you OK with me taking Mr. DeLite's case...?\nMaya:\nY-Yeah... I'm fine, Nick. I believe in you.\nPhoenix:\n... *sniffle* (I think I'm going to cry.)\nRon:\nUmm... I, err... I know you have a lot of work to do... I... I really appreciate it.\nMaya:\nOK, Nick! Let's get this show on the road!\nExamine\nSecurity camera\nPhoenix:\nSmile, you're on candid camera. The camera doesn't seem to have a lot to tape right now. The only thing it's watching now is that guard over there.\nSecurity guard\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room. It looks like he doesn't have much to do right now. I can tell because he's looking at the camera and making funny faces.\nOctober 12Wright & Co. Law Offices\nPearl:\nAh... Mr. Nick! W-Welcome back!\nPhoenix:\nOh, hey Pearls. You're back too, I see.\nPearl:\nI, um... I went and bought us a strawberry cake! I'll go make some tea to go with it!\nPhoenix:\nHey, uh Pearls... ...\nMaya:\nIt looks like she feels really bad about what happened at the detention center...\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick...! I-I was wrong about you... I shouldn't have trusted you!\nPearl:\nI-I... I'll never forgive you... EVER!\nPearl:\nMystic Maya! The tea is ready!\nMaya:\nOh... Thanks...\nPearl:\nCome on, Mr. Nick! Please have some of this cake!\nPhoenix:\nYeah... Thanks. Umm, Pearls?\nPearl:\nOh! Ex-Excuse me... I was in the middle of cleaning the toilet...!\nPhoenix:\nHey, it's OK! I just cleaned it this morning...\nMaya:\nToo late...\nPhoenix:\n(...This might be a good time for me to ask about her.)\nExamine\nCharley the plant\nPhoenix:\nCharley. A quite decorative plant. When she was alive, Mia really loved it. She even went so far as to make it our mascot. No matter how busy I get, I never forget to water this little fella.\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nIt's my desk. I don't get to use it much, so the dust bunnies are starting to mount their assault. Hm? Today it's sparkly clean. I guess Pearls must've wiped them out for me.\nBookshelf\nPhoenix:\nDifficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. These were all Mia's... Wow, I just realized I didn't buy a single one of these.\nTalk\nPearl\nPhoenix:\n(I first met Pearls a year ago... It was when that murder happened at Kurain Village. I still remember what she said to me when we first met...)\nPearl:\nYou... You're Mr. Nick, right? You're... You're Mystic Maya's... \"special someone\"...\nPhoenix:\n...Hey, Maya. I've always thought it was because she was young, but...\nMaya:\nBut what...?\nPhoenix:\nPearls... I think she's got the wrong idea. About... you and me. (Changed from [About... you and I.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nHuh!? Err, I... ...Umm...There's something you need to understand...\nPhoenix:\nWh-What is it?\nMaya:\nUmm... It's kind of like a Kurain Village custom... Sort of.\nMaya\nPhoenix:\nPearls seems to love you a lot.\nMaya:\nWell, it's because I'm her only cousin. And... well... Because of the murder case last year, Pearly's mother is...\nPhoenix:\nOh yeah...\nPhoenix:\n(I remember now... Pearls's mother, Morgan Fey... She's serving a prison term in isolation right now...)\nMaya:\nSo you see? I'm the only family Pearly has right now... But... It's the same for me, too.\nPhoenix:\nMaya...\nMaya:\nMy mother's gone, too...\nKurain Village Custom (appears after \"Pearl\")\nMaya:\nThere are hardly any men in Kurain Village.\nPhoenix:\nNow that you mention it, I never actually saw any men there when I visited.\nMaya:\nI'm pretty sure I told you about it a long time ago... About how spiritual powers run very strong in the Fey family.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, you did. And that's why you're undergoing training to be a spirit medium, right?\nMaya:\nYeah... The thing is, only women can actually inherit the spiritual power. That's why the whole culture of Kurain Village kinda revolves around its women.\nPhoenix:\nWell, that's understandable... Nothing wrong with that.\nMaya:\nYeah, but because of that... There tends to be a lot of unsuccessful marriages.\nPhoenix:\nOh?\nMaya:\nWell, men start to feel left out after a while, and then they just start leaving. ...Especially if the man has a daughter.\nPhoenix:\nAre you saying that Pearls's father...?\nMaya:\n...He's gone. He left the village when she was very young.\nPhoenix:\nBoy, that's tough...\nMaya:\nYeah, and she grew up seeing nothing but unhappy marriages all around her. That's why she's so sensitive to things like that.\nMaya's mother (appears after \"Maya\")\nPhoenix:\nSo your mother's still missing...?\nMaya:\nYeah... And no one has any idea where she is.\nPhoenix:\n(Maya's mother... Misty Fey. The current Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. She disappeared 17 years ago after getting involved in a certain police case.)\nPhoenix:\n...But you're sure she's still alive, right?\nMaya:\nYeah... I know she is... It's sort of a spirit medium thing...\nPhoenix:\nAnd if your mother doesn't come back, then what...?\nMaya:\nThen according to the laws of the village, I'll become the next Master.\nPhoenix:\nMystic Maya... The Master of the Kurain Technique... Sounds like a heavy responsibility.\nMaya:\nYeah, but there's no one else with the blood of the Fey main family who's a spirit medium.\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nMaya:\nSo you've still got that badge, I see.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Well, I'm a lawyer, aren't I?\nMaya:\nYeah, but I guess I just didn't think you'd keep on being one for this long. You have to admit, you've had some close brushes with death because of your job.\nPhoenix:\n(...I fail to see how being a lawyer is more dangerous than channeling dead people.)\nTreasure Exhibit Poster or Sacred Urn\nMaya:\nYou know, I thought we'd finally found the urn.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, if only Ron DeLite were Mask☆DeMasque, we'd have figured it all out.\nMaya:\nHuh? You mean he's NOT Mask☆DeMasque?\nPhoenix:\nWell, Desirée says he isn't and I believe her.\nMaya:\nHmm... The mystery gets deeper and deeper.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, and the trial starts tomorrow... as usual.\nDeMasque's Calling Card\nPhoenix:\nSo this was made by the real Mask☆DeMasque, huh?\nMaya:\nYup, Detective Gumshoe said it was the real thing. \"One look at this mark and you know it's the real deal, pal.\"\nPhoenix:\nYeah, but you do realize whose deductive reasoning skills we're talking about, right...?\nShichishito\nMaya:\nThis sword... It has a strange aura surrounding it. It's like it's infused with a spirit of both anger and tragedy.\nPhoenix:\nWell, I'd be mad too if somebody bent me the way they bent this sword.\nMaya:\n...Yeah, I guess that could be it.\nPhoenix Wright profile\nMaya:\nWhen did you first get that porcupine cut?\nPhoenix:\n...Um, it's been like this ever since I was a little kid.\nMaya:\nWhat!? You mean that's the way your hair is naturally? I thought you had some sort of special \"Phoenix Cut\" deal with the barber. I mean... You usually only see hair like that in a video game.\nMia Fey profile\nPhoenix:\nIf it wasn't for Mia, I wouldn't be the person I am today.\nMaya:\nYeah, she told me you used to really be useless. Compared to how unreliable you were then, you actually seem responsible now. ...Actually, you haven't changed that much, I guess.\nPhoenix:\n(Maya praised me for a change! ...Hey, wait a second...)\nPearl Fey profile\nMaya:\nI'm so sorry that Pearly said what she did.\nPhoenix:\nOh, It's fine... It-It was nothing... (I'm going to have to smooth things over with Pearls later somehow...)\nDick Gumshoe profile\nMaya:\nDetective Gumshoe's on this case too, huh.\nPhoenix:\nHe seems to show up during all of our cases. It can't be a coincidence.\nMaya:\nMaybe it's a sign that our fates are destined to be woven together for all time!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, that'd be a real Beauty and the Beast kind of fairy tale, wouldn't it.\nMask☆DeMasque or Ron DeLite profile\nMaya:\nSo the real identity of Mask☆DeMasque is... ...Ron DeLite, right?\nPhoenix:\nThat's what Mr. DeLite claims. ...But I'm not too convinced about something he said.\nMaya:\nHuh? About what?\nPhoenix:\nAbout the Sacred Urn. Didn't he sound a little vague on the subject?\nMaya:\nYeah, now that you mention it, he said that he simply \"lost it\", right?\nPhoenix:\n(I have this distinct feeling that he's hiding something. I just know it...)\nLuke Atmey profile\nMaya:\nThat Detective Atmey guy really surprised me. There was this certain something about the way he said, \"Zvarri!\"\nPhoenix:\nWell he did manage to get back the treasure that the Mask guy stole last time, right? And he did it by himself, too.\nMaya:\nYeah, I guess. ...That case has certainly made him famous.\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like he does deserve to be called \"Ace Detective\" after all.\nDesirée DeLite profile\nMaya:\nThat Desirée sure is cool! I love that whole motorcycle thing! The way she laughs in the face of death... I want to try it myself!\nPhoenix:\nI thought you only knew how to ride a bike...\nMaya:\nHey! Don't forget, Nick, that it's an electric bike!\nPhoenix:\n...E-Electric? So young and already so lazy. Whatever happened to good old exercise?\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you think about this?\nMaya:\nHmmm... It seems like it has something to do with this case... But I'm not really sure...\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nMaya:\nWell, Nick! Why don't we go out and start investigating? We're not going to learn anything just sitting around the office!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I know... But... First I want to talk to Pearls...\nPearl:\n...Umm, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah...?\nPearl:\nI... I acted like a baby.\nPhoenix:\nPearls...\nPearl:\nI doubted you... Even though Mystic Maya trusted you completely... I guess I still have a lot of training to do. Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes?\nPearl:\nI... From the bottom of my heart, I apologize for what I said!\nPhoenix:\nAww, it's OK! I'm the one that should be apologizing!\nPearl:\nWell, I'm going out now for a little bit.\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? Wh-Where are you going...?\nPearl:\nI may be small, but I still have a lot of spirit channeling power! So I'm going to show you I can be useful too... By finding some evidence!\nPhoenix:\nHey! W-Wait a...! (Ack! She sure runs fast...)\nMaya:\nNick... Let's back off and give her some room, OK?\nPhoenix:\n...Yeah.\nOctober 12Lordly TailorMain Exhibition Hall\nAndrews:\nM-Maya...!\nMaya:\nOh, Ms. Andrews...\nAndrews:\nI'm so sorry! It's my fault! ...Your precious urn! Your... precious... UUUUURNNN!!!\nPhoenix:\nPlease! C-Calm down! What's wrong?\nAndrews:\n*sniffle* It never ends! Everything I touch ends in failure! Maya, I'm sorry...! I'll do anything to make it up to you!\nMaya:\nN-No, it's okay, don--\nAndrews:\nI know I don't look it, but I'm good with my hands. I could make you another urn.\nMaya:\nHold on, just wait, OK? Breathe, calm down and talk to us.\nAndrews:\nF-Forgive me! Forgive me!\nExamine\nCushion\nPhoenix:\nThat's probably where the Sacred Urn was going to be displayed.\nMaya:\nYeah, I guess so...\nPhoenix:\nShould I put my attorney's badge there? You know, as a replacement?\nMaya:\nHmm... I think it's a little too small for that. What about my Magatama?\nPhoenix:\nNow you're being silly... That's definitely too small.\nFolding screen\nMaya:\nIt's the folding screen of Kurain Sacred Writings. But I can't read what it says on it.\nPhoenix:\nReally? But I thought it was some kind of important spell!\nMaya:\nAhh, yeah. My mother read it and taught me to memorize it. I'll be in trouble if I ever forget it.\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like the Kurain Channeling School is teetering dangerously on the edge...)\nKurain Village diorama\nMaya:\nWow, this is incredible! It's a tiny version of my Kurain Village! Hey! I've got a great idea! We can make a miniature of your office, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nI don't know about that. The whole place is overflowing with junk. You'd die before you finish painstakingly recreating that mess.\nMaya:\nWell, we could always clean it up first.\nPhoenix:\n*shrug* True.\nTalk\nDeMasque's calling card\nPhoenix:\nUmm... So when did you get the calling card from Mask☆DeMasque?\nAndrews:\nLet's see... Exactly 10 days ago. I was going to show it to the police... But that detective stopped me.\nMaya:\nUm, so you asked Detective Atmey to help with security?\nAndrews:\nYes. In fact, it was about 20 days ago that I hired him. He seemed to know much more about Mask☆DeMasque than the police.\nPhoenix:\nSo you hired him for security even before the calling card arrived?\nAndrews:\nWell, yes. I had a premonition that something bad might happen... I've learned to trust my hunches!\nPhoenix:\nSo that's why there are security cameras, even in the basement warehouse?\nAndrews:\nYes. Lordly Tailor is very serious about their security measures. It was their way of saying, \"Bring it on!\" to any potential thieves...\nPhoenix:\n(Well, he sure \"brought it\" last night... And even left with a nice souvenir.)\nThe security\nMaya:\nUm, can you tell us a bit about the security for the Treasure Exhibit?\nAndrews:\nIt was all my fault! I never should have called this paltry little collection a \"treasure exhibit\" anyway...\nPhoenix:\nWhy do you say that? The urn that was stolen is a pretty important object...\nAndrews:\nMaybe, but it's actual value after appraisal was... well, practically zero.\nMaya:\nZero!?\nAndrews:\nI polished it until it was just about glowing... I thought maybe I could make it look more valuable!\nMaya:\nB-But that urn contains the soul of Mystic Ami...\nAndrews:\nAnyway, I left all the security arrangements to Detective Atmey. But... Five days ago, I began receiving all sorts of other exhibit items from Kurain. Lots of people started going in and out of the warehouse down there.\nMaya:\nSo maybe one of them was actually Mask☆DeMasque in disguise...!\nAndrews:\nNo, I personally checked out everyone that came through here, so that's not possible.\nPhoenix:\n(Knowing Adrian, she probably even checked out what they ate for breakfast that morning.)\nPresent\nAnything\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Ms. Andrews?\nAndrews:\nI know, I know! It's all my fault! But what's done is done... I'll make it up by making a new urn for you...\nPhoenix:\n(I'm just wasting my time. She's too far gone...)\nBasement Warehouse\nExamine\nSecurity camera\nPhoenix:\nI wonder if that detective brought this camera in with him?\nMaya:\nGood question! Let's take a look at it. ...Huh? It says \"Property of Lordly Tailor\" on it.\nPhoenix:\nSo it's borrowed...?\nMaya:\nKind of strange for an \"Ace Detective\", don't you think?\nComputer\nPhoenix:\nAccording to the computer data... ...someone did in fact go through those big doors last night, right?\nMaya:\nYeah, I guess so. The shutter did go off once, you know.\nWooden box\nPhoenix:\nThat pathetic-looking wooden box...\nMaya:\nAhh!! That's the box that had the Sacred Urn on it!\nPhoenix:\nDon't touch it! There may be clues to the thief's identity on there!\nMaya:\nGrr... I worked so hard to make that box!\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? You MADE that poor excuse for a box, Maya?\nMaya:\nWhat's that supposed to mean!? And I-I was so proud of it... *sniffle sniffle*\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Maya. Maybe it'd have been better if Mask☆DeMasque had taken the box, too...)\nShichishito\nMaya:\nI'm really starting to like this thing. It's so cool-looking. I'd like to strap it to my waist and walk around town like a samurai.\nPhoenix:\nCareful. Gumshoe will lock you up and throw away the key if you're caught.\nDoor to the storeroom\nMaya:\nOur precious urn was right there on the other side of these doors.\nPhoenix:\nYeah. and according to the security computer data...\nMaya:\nSomeone was in there last night. Grrr... What I'd like to do to him...!\nSpilled paint\nPhoenix:\nIt looks to me like it's been dry for several days.\nMaya:\nThere's something suspicious about this paint mark. The bottom left part of it is shaped oddly and it's shocking pink.\nPhoenix:\n...I don't see how the color of the paint is in any way important.\nAmi Fey statue\nPhoenix:\nWhen we were here with Ms. Andrews last night, the statue wasn't there it is now.\nMaya:\nYeah, it was right next to the door, wasn't it?\nPhoenix:\nWell, if someone moved it, it was probably the criminal.\nMaya:\nMaybe he didn't like being watched by Mystic Ami while he stole the urn.\nPhoenix:\n...Hey! Cut it out! You're giving me the creeps with that kind of talk!\nAfter clearing all Talk options in Wright & Co. Law Offices and clearing \"The security\" Talk option in Lordly Tailor - Main Exhibition Hall:\nOctober 12Atmey Detective Agency\nMaya:\nHello?\n...Well, well. How lovely it is to see you again, my dear.\nAtmey:\nWelcome to my abode! Relax! and soak up the atmosphere...\nPhoenix:\nErr, umm... We're actually kind of...\nAtmey:\nSHHH! SILENCE! ... Hee hee hee hee hee... Precisely as I expected.\nMaya:\nWh-What is?\nAtmey:\n...Zvarri! The truth has once again been elegantly revealed to me! A lawyer, and... a spirit medium. ...Am I correct?\nMaya:\n...Umm. I think we've already been through this.\nAtmey:\nHa! So my estimation was correct! Zvarri! ...How truly elegant. Now then, what can I do for you?\nExamine\nGramophone\nMaya:\nAaah! So the music in this room is coming from here!\nAtmey:\n\"Luke Atmey Elegy\" composed by Luke Atmey. This lovely device is called a \"gramophone\". In days of yore, people listened to music on them.\nMaya:\nAha! That's just what I thought! I told you so, Nick!\nPhoenix:\n...\nLuke Atmey painting\nMaya:\nThat's quite a large portrait of yourself you have there...\nAtmey:\nYes. I wanted it to say to everyone who saw it, \"Look at me, Luke Atmey!\" With a model so fine, I knew the portrait would also be aesthetically pleasing!\nMaya:\n...Um, that's nice.\nFireplace\nMaya:\nAaah! There's a cold breeze coming from this hearth!\nAtmey:\nHee hee hee hee... It seems you've fallen for my little deception. You see, this fireplace conceals a rather unexpected device. ...Yes! A high-tech air conditioner!\nMaya:\nWh-Why would you put an air conditioner in there?\nAtmey:\nIn the summer it acts as an air conditioner and in the winter, it's a heater. Clever?\nTalk\nThe night of the crime\nPhoenix:\nYou mentioned before that you were on guard all alone last night.\nAtmey:\nPrecisely. This is my fifth encounter with my arch-enemy. I refuse to allow anyone to interfere with the rightful pursuit of my prey.\nMaya:\nI heard you've been after Mask☆DeMasque since his very first theft?\nAtmey:\nYes, my dear. I see you've done your homework. In his very first heist, that vile thief pilfered the famous jewel, the \"Tear of Emanon\"! I first encountered him in the museum's sacred hall. The crime scene itself!\nMaya:\nSo... that's why you were hired as security for the Treasure Exhibit?\nPhoenix:\n(I'm pretty sure he said that Adrian Andrews hired him...)\nAtmey:\nYes, I borrowed some equipment from Lordly Tailor and set the perfect trap.\nPhoenix:\nYou must mean the security camera...\nMaya:\nBut I thought you were watching the area yourself, too. So how did Mask☆DeMasque manage to steal the urn?\nPhoenix:\nThat's the million dollar question... What is DeMasque's modus operandi?\nSacred Urn\nMaya:\nUmm... Mr. Atmey? Did you know about the Sacred Urn?\nAtmey:\nI'm interested in only one thing my dear, and that is Mask☆DeMasque! Sacred Urn...? Pfft! That has nothing to do with this case.\nPhoenix:\nBut... wasn't that what Mask☆DeMasque stole this time?\nAtmey:\nI am a hunter, sir! That urn was nothing more than a lure to catch my prey. Do you yourselves remember the shape of the individual peanuts you throw to pigeons?\nMaya:\n...I don't think I like this guy's attitude, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWell anyway, it looks like he doesn't know about the urn.\nDeMasque's M.O. (appears after \"The night of the crime\")\nMaya:\nUmm... There's something that's kind of bothering me.\nAtmey:\nPlease, my dear, ask me anything you like. After all, we are all but seekers, wandering alone in the dark.\nMaya:\nWell, I was wondering how Mask☆DeMasque managed to steal the urn. I mean, isn't it strange that you don't seem to know?\nAtmey:\n...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, now that you mention it, it is strange. After all, you were on guard that night at the scene of the crime. Unless you were sound asleep, you should have at least seen Mask☆DeMasque.\nAtmey:\n...\n1 PSYCHE-LOCK\nPhoenix:\nWh-What the!? It's a Psyche-Lock...\nMaya:\nPs-Psyche Lock...?\nDeMasque's M.O. (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nMr. Atmey... You must know more than you're letting on. How did Mask☆DeMasque manage to steal the Sacred Urn...?\n1 PSYCHE-LOCK\nAtmey:\nIn order for a secret to remain a secret, it must be kept secret.\nPhoenix:\n(Last night Luke Atmey must have encountered Mask☆DeMasque... But why would he be trying to hide it...?)\nMaya:\nNick! Go for it! Let's break that Psyche-Lock of his!\nPhoenix:\n(...I don't really think she understands what she's talking about. Well, it's been a while, but let's give this a shot...)\nPsyche-Lock (appears after \"DeMasque's M.O.\", before breaking Psyche-Lock)\nMaya:\nHey, Nick, what is this Psyche-Lock thing?\nPhoenix:\nWell, your magatama lets me see when people are keeping secrets. By breaking their mental \"locks\", I can find out what those secrets are.\nMaya:\nWhaaaaat!? This Magatama has THAT kind of power!?\nPhoenix:\n... Maya, you're the one who gave me this Magatama last year...\nMaya:\n...Well, it's true that this Magatama is a prized Fey family heirloom, but... Pearly was the one that actually imbued it with spiritual powers, right? That's why I don't really know much about what it can do.\nPhoenix:\n(This is the woman that's going to take over the Kurain Channeling School someday!?)\nMaya:\nSo how do you do it? How do you break the Psyche-Lock thing?\nPhoenix:\n...Well, you present the Magatama to the person with the secret.\nMaya:\n...Cool! I can't wait to see it in action! Come on! Try it out!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh boy... I think the future Master still needs to learn how to be patient...)\nDeMasque's M.O. (after breaking Psyche-Lock)\nAtmey:\nI can't deny that there may be a small hint of \"truth\" in what you say.\nMaya:\nSo, you were knocked out when the thief first clobbered you?\nAtmey:\nClobber... What an ugly way of saying it. But I suppose you could put it that way. The coward struck at the precise moment that I turned to look at the computer.\nMaya:\nSo you never noticed that the thief had entered the warehouse?\nAtmey:\nNo, the coward must have wormed his way in through somewhere besides the door... Perhaps the air ducts or the sewer pipes... Then my arch-nemesis struck me on the head from behind with this gruesome item here!\nMaya:\nOuch. Mr. Atmey should have his poor head examined. (Changed from [Ouch. He should have his poor head examined.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nYou can say that again.

O.  --\nPhoenix:\nDetective Atmey, you were standing guard at the scene of the crime... There's no way you didn't see Mask☆DeMasque commit the crime.\nAtmey:\nWell now, I can hardly see why you're so positive about that. Yes, indeed I was guarding the warehouse. That much is true. But I can tell you for certain that not a single person passed through that door.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not sure why... But this Atmey guy is lying through his teeth. ...I know. I'll show him some proof!) Detective Atmey, I have here proof that someone went through that door last night!\nPresent Camera Data\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"There was a security camera set up at the scene of the crime.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nAtmey:\nHow very interesting that you would present such a thing to me, Luke Atmey, Ace Detective. Unfortunately... It is meaningless. You need to go home, take a long, cold shower and get a good night's rest, Sir Lawyer.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess that's a miss...)\nAtmey:\nWell then...? Is there something else I can do for you?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Maybe I don't have enough evidence yet. If that's true, it could be dangerous for me to push on. But I need to break him!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Detective Atmey, I have here proof that someone went through that door last night!\"\nPhoenix:\nThere was a security camera set up at the scene of the crime. It should have automatically taken a photo of anyone that went through that door.\nAtmey:\n...Precisely.\nPhoenix:\nI hope you don't mind, but we've already gotten our hands on the camera data. As you can see, the camera went off exactly once last night.\nAtmey:\nWha...! B-But my monocle didn't catch anyone in its flash! It must be some kind of computer malfunction... It-It must be...!\nPhoenix:\nMaybe it was your monocle that malfunctioned.\nAtmey:\nWh-What!? Are you saying that I didn't do my duty properly?\nPhoenix:\nDetective Atmey. You must have seen the thief last night. The question is why are you trying to hide it! (If he's hiding it, there must be some reason! Some reason that he desperately wants to keep hidden... And I've got just the piece of evidence that should prove it!) OK, let's suppose you didn't manage to see Mask☆DeMasque. In that case, the reason you didn't at that time was because you were...\nfast asleep.\nAtmey:\n...I'm afraid that making a guess is not enough. Time to put your money where your mouth is.

Not scientifically, anyway. You need to go home, take a long, cold shower and get a good night's rest, Sir Lawyer.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh! I guess I need to think this over again!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Detective Atmey. You must have seen the thief last night.\"\nPhoenix:\nDetective Atmey... You were knocked unconscious by the thief, weren't you!?\nAtmey:\nHa ha ha! Surely you must be joking... You think that I, Luke Atmey, could be knocked unconscious so easily!?\nPhoenix:\nThis sword proves it!\nAtmey:\n...! Th-That's...\nPhoenix:\nBefore the theft, this sword was in the hand of the statue of Ami Fey. Furthermore... at that time, it was not bent.\nAtmey:\nAaah... Err...\nPhoenix:\n...There's only one explanation. You were struck on the head and knocked unconscious by this sword! Well, Detective!? How about it!? (Changed from [Well, Detective!? What about it!?] in the original release)\nAtmey:\n...I'm impressed. You truly are an \"Ace Attorney\"...\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nUnlock Successful\nRon DeLite profile\nAtmey:\nThis man surrendered to the police, admitting that he was Mask☆DeMasque.\nPhoenix:\nMaybe so... But I'm not convinced that he's really behind the thefts.\nAtmey:\nHe is.\nMaya:\n...He sounds pretty sure.\nAtmey:\nJust look at his forehead. It's all in the shape of his mouth and eyes... This is the classic face of a thief. It is unmistakable!\nMaya:\nIs there anything that isn't \"unmistakable\" to you...\nAny other profile\nPhoenix:\nWhat about this person here, Detective Atmey?\nAtmey:\n...\nMaya:\nIs something wrong? Did the cat get your tongue or something?\nAtmey:\nThat photo leaves me with a distinctly indistinct feeling.\nPhoenix:\nUmmm...\nAtmey:\nIn this case, I'm afraid my perspicacity has been left wanting.\nPhoenix:\n(I think he's trying to say that he doesn't have any information...)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\nWell it looks like we got one thing cleared up anyway.\nMaya:\nHuh? What? That Atmey is the greatest Ace Detective in the world?\nPhoenix:\nNo, that he never actually saw the thief.\nMaya:\nOh... that's right! So the thief may not even be Mask☆DeMasque...\nAtmey:\nJust one moment, Sir Lawyer! The thief was unquestionably Mask☆DeMasque!\nMaya:\nBut you never actually saw him!\nAtmey:\nPerhaps so, but I installed a security camera for just such a contingency.\nMaya:\nOh...\nAtmey:\nLast night, the camera went off exactly once. Behold! This is a photo of the dastardly thief, taken by the security camera!\nPhoenix:\n...Th-That's him!\nMaya:\nM-Mask☆DeMasque...!\nSecurity Camera Photo added to the Court Record.\nAtmey:\nThe thief can be none other than the arch-criminal, Mask☆DeMasque. After all, he has a very good reason for committing such brazen crimes.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What are you talking about?\nTalk\nDeMasque's reason\nPhoenix:\nSo... What did you mean by he had a \"very good reason\"?\nAtmey:\nExactly that. Mr. DeLite had a very good reason to dress up and commit those crimes. There should be a green envelope somewhere in his room. ...You'll need to go and investigate.\nMaya:\nB-But how would you know about that...?\nAtmey:\nHmph. Have you forgotten? You're speaking to the finest Ace Detective ever to walk on the face of the earth! The most brilliant mind since ...well, EVER! Luke Atmey!\nPhoenix:\n(*sigh* Well, I guess we'd better go take a look, just in case...)\nDeMasque's Hideout (after clearing \"DeMasque's reason\" Talk option in Atmey Detective Agency)\nExamine\nGreen envelope\nLeads to:\n\"Hey! Nick! Remember what Detective Atmey said!?\"\nMaya:\nHey! Nick! Remember what Detective Atmey said!?\nAtmey:\nExactly that. Mr. DeLite had a very good reason to dress up and commit those crimes. There should be a green envelope somewhere in his room. ...You'll need to go and investigate.\nPhoenix:\nA green envelope, huh... Looks like this is it.\nMaya:\nOK! Let's have a look! \"If you don't want your true identity revealed to the world... ...come to KB Security at 1:00 AM on October 12th and bring $50,000.\" F-F-F-Fifty thousand...!\nPhoenix:\nTh-Th...

I'll be right back. Won't take but a second, I promise. (Oh, thank you for coming!

You... You're... Nick, it's you! And Maya, too! What a fluke!\nMaya:\nAh...! Larry! Long time no see!\nDesirée:\nWhat? You know each other?\nButz:\nNi... \"Nicky boy\"!? Nick, do you and this girl have... you know... something going on?\nPhoenix:\n\"S-Something\"? If you mean what I thin--\nButz:\nI underestimated you, Nick! A gorgeous lady like this? ...And married, too? Way to go, dude!\nPhoenix:\n(I knew it. Just when things can't get any worse, it's time to cue in the Butz.) Larry Butz... Ever since grade school, he's been... Not exactly a close friend, but yeah, we know each other.\nButz:\nHey, man, that wasn't nice! I was your very first client!\nPhoenix:\nWe've got quite the... storied history, he and I. (Changed from [It's been 25 years since I first met Larry.] in the original release) And what we used to say still rings true. When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\nButz:\nHey, come on now! You're embarrassing me! And in front of this pretty little thing here...\nDesirée:\nSo you two are old childhood friends, I see. That's so sweet! You two go ahead and catch up on old times. I'm going to go check on my bike.\nButz:\nNice girl, that Dessie... So how have ya been, Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Too busy if you really want to know...)\nExamine\nGreen envelope\nPhoenix:\nSo Ron received a blackmail letter, huh?\nMaya:\nDo you think Ms. DeLite knows about this?\nPhoenix:\nWell if she did, I don't think she would've been smiling like that.\nMaya:\nI wonder if we should tell her about it...\nPhoenix:\nI think it'd be smarter if we didn't.\nTalk\nLarry Butz\nPhoenix:\nSo what have you been up to this whole time? It's been two years since I heard from you. And what's with these clothes? You look... well, weird.\nButz:\nHey man, that's uncalled for. This is my uniform, from a my part-time job! But I can't believe it's been two years. They say time flies when you're having fun. Ha ha ha ha... Ah ha... Ha... ...ha?\nPhoenix:\nWh-What's wrong?\nButz:\nNick... I gotta tell you. Women. ...I don't trust'em anymore.\nPhoenix:\nYou got dumped again?\nButz:\nWell, you know Bennifer? I followed her all the way to Tibet 2 years ago. That's where I met the famous Katty Tom, and my whole life changed.\nPhoenix:\n\"Bennifer\"? \"Katty Tom\"? I never heard of either of them.\nButz:\nAnyway... Dude! Katty Tom chose Hollywood over me! Can you believe it?\nMaya:\nWell, actually... Anyway sounds like you had quite the adventure.\nButz:\nWomen! They're so... so... Aaaah! Oh... B-But you're different, Maya. You're not like the rest.\nPhoenix:\n(...Looks like he's still the same old Larry.)\nWhy are you here? (Changed from [Why you came here] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nSo what are you doing here anyway?\nButz:\nHuh...? What do you mean by that? I'm just a natural-born nice guy, that's all. Well, actually... I picked this up last night while I was working.\nPhoenix:\n...A wallet? You say you found this last night?\nButz:\nYeah, it had a driver's license in it, so I figured I'd just return it myself.\nRon's Wallet added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nHang on... Let me see that for a minute. ... I know it. Dessie's picture is in here.\nButz:\nYeah, I guess he really digs his wife, huh? ... Hey, Nick... It's not what you're thinking at all!\nPhoenix:\nNo, I'm pretty sure it is. You haven't changed a bit.\nButz:\nAw, no way man! I mean, she's a married woman! That's just bad news!\nPhoenix:\n(He really IS here just to check out Ms. DeLite...)\nMaya:\nSo you said you found it at your job, right?\nButz:\nYeah! I'm working for a private security company as a guard! Chicks just love a guy in uniform, you know!\nPhoenix:\n(A security guard, huh. So that's what that uniform is all about...)\nWhy are you here?

Why are you asking that!? Trying to see if I've got an \"alibi\"!?\nPhoenix:\n(Umm... You're not the one on the hook for a crime this time, buddy.)\nButz:\nI guess it was around 1:00 in the morning on the first floor of our company building.\nPhoenix:\n(What was Mr. DeLite's wallet doing there...?)\nButz:\n...Anyway, there's nothing weird about that. After all, he works there.\nMaya:\nHe... works there? You mean... Mr. DeLite?\nButz:\nSure. Here, take a look at this. It's right there in his wallet.\nMaya:\nWhat's this card?\nButz:\nIt's a key card for the security company. See! It's got a serial number on it right there. There's no mistake about it.

You know about it!?\nButz:\nThat's where I work, yeah. In fact, I'm on the job right now.\nMaya:\nHuh...? So what are you doing here then?\nButz:\nWell, the boss is away right now, and you know what mice do when the cat's away...\nPhoenix:\n...Yes, yes. *sigh* Anyway, how far away is this company?\nButz:\nLemme see... About 30 minutes by car, I guess... Well, if you fly down the road, anyway.\nPhoenix:\nHmm. Well, this apartment building is pretty close to Lordly Tailor, right?\nMaya:\nAnd it would take roughly an hour to go from here to KB Security and back.\nPhoenix:\nIf Ron DeLite was at KB Security when the robbery occurred, then...\nMaya:\nWhoa...! Then he couldn't have stolen Sacred Urn!\nPresent\nTreasure Exhibit Poster, Ami Fey's Golden Statue, Sacred Urn, or Shichishito\nPhoenix:\nLarry, this is one of the treasures from Kurain Village...\nButz:\nBe serious, Nick!

And that's the truth!\nPhoenix:\n... Huh? What?\nButz:\nI-I can't believe you'd do this to me! I thought you were my friend! Fifty thousand dollars! I don't have that kind of money!\nPhoenix:\nNo, no, you don't understand! This blackmail letter was sent to Ron DeLite!\nButz:\nWheeeew! Man, you scared me!! I almost had a heart attack, you idiot!\nPhoenix:\nWait, I'm the idiot!?\nButz:\nMan, I was totally confused because it says, \"KB Security\" right on the envelope.\nMaya:\nUm, yeah...

Whaaaat!\nPhoenix:\n(Sounds like I should really find out some more about this KB Security company!)\nRon's Wallet\nPhoenix:\nYou didn't touch anything in the wallet, did you?\nButz:\nHey man, be serious!

That's the key card we use at the building I work in. (Changed from [Yup. That's the key card they use at the building I work in.] in the original release) According to the serial number, this one is for the CEO's office.

So what's the deal between you and this girl?\nMaya:\nHey! That's my cousin! Her name is Pearl Fey.\nButz:\nPearl, huh... Too bad. Never date two girls with the same name...

Can you afford to waste time lollygagging about here?\nPhoenix:\nWh-What do you mean by that?\nAtmey:\nPerhaps I should make myself more clear? Tomorrow's trial... Zvarri!

What's going to happen at the trial tomorrow that's so dramatic?\nAtmey:\nDo you know what your biggest mistake so far has been, Sir Lawyer? ...It was becoming a lawyer in the first place.\nPearl:\n...That certainly does sound like a big mistake, Mr. Nick.\nAtmey:\nTomorrow will be a day to remember. I, Luke Atmey, will take the stand! And then... Zvarri! My testimony will prove to be the undoing of the lot of you! Yes! All of you! I will unmask you as the thief's co-conspirators!\nMaya:\nC-C-Conspirators!?\nAtmey:\nHee hee hee hee hee... You're quick on the defensive, I see! However! It is not I that is your greatest enemy! There is a far more dangerous threat that you will face during the trial.\nMaya:\nWh-What are you talking about...?\nAtmey:\nSir Lawyer... If you truly are who you say, I'm sure you've heard of him. ...His name is \"Godot\".\nPhoenix:\nG-Godot...?\nDeMasque's identity\nAtmey:\nYou have taken a step down the path of foolishness. To try to defend a career criminal who deserves nothing less than the death penalt--\nMaya:\nHey! Last time I checked, no one knows for sure that Mr. DeLite really is DeMasque!\nAtmey:\nHee hee hee hee hee... My dear lady... Times may change, but people, sadly, do not... ...Well. You will understand this when you are more mature.\nGodot (appears after \"Tomorrow's trial\")\nMaya:\nUm... Who is this \"Godot\" person...?\nAtmey:\n...It's not surprising that a spirit medium has not heard the name. Godot. The prosecutor whose equal cannot be found in this country, but in heaven. Godot. A legend or myth... Men pin a lifetime of hopes on the chance to simply meet him.\nPearl:\nProsecutor Godot... (Changed from [Prosecutor...] in the original release)\nMaya:\nBut the best prosecutor in the country isn't Godot, it's Mr. Edgeworth! Isn't that right, Nick!?\nAtmey:\n...It's no surprise that a spirit medium such as yourself would know nothing of this. But Ace Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth is currently traveling abroad.\nMaya:\nHuh...?\nAtmey:\nIn fact, it was Mr. Edgeworth who acknowledged Godot as the best in this country.\nPearl:\nAnd you agree with that?\nAtmey:\nMost certainly. In fact, you could call him the Luke Atmey of the Prosecutor's Office.\nMaya:\nWell, that's good to hear! The prosecution has a fighting chance tomorrow!\nPearl:\nMr. Nick, is this \"Godot\" really that strong?\nPhoenix:\nHmm... I seem to remember hearing about something like that...\nAtmey:\nNot surprising... Some people spend their entire lives idly waiting for his appearance.\nPresent\nAnything\nMaya:\nUmmm, Mr. Atmey...? Could you take a look at this?\nAtmey:\nOh please. You can drop the pretense already.\nMaya:\nHuh...?\nAtmey:\nYou and I are already fated to fight each other...

You can laugh all you want... But you'll be singing another tune tonight!\nPhoenix:\nTonight? What about tonight?\nPearl:\nThe \"Treasures of Kurain\" exhibit doesn't actually start until next week, but... ...the promoter sent us some special VIP entry passes!\nMaya:\nThat's why I dressed up extra special today! What do you think, Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Heh. Same Maya. Different day.) This young lady here is Maya Fey... The younger sister of Mia Fey... ...My friend and mentor. I first met her two years ago... I was working on the case surrounding Mia's death, and ever since then...\nMaya:\nI've been the one who's been keeping this law office afloat from behind the scenes.\nPhoenix:\nActually that's just a cover for her true identity... In reality, she's a spirit medium, and a bit of a shady character.\nMaya:\nHey! Who are you calling \"shady\"!?\nPhoenix:\nAnd this little girl is Pearl Fey, but I usually call her \"Pearls\". She's Maya's cousin and a spirit medium in training herself.\nPearl:\nI know I'm a bit young, but I want to help in any way I can, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nKurain Village is the home of the mysterious Kurain Channelling Technique. And Maya here is the daughter of the Kurain School of Channeling's Master. ...I know it sounds ridiculous, but it's no joke. I've seen her power with my own eyes... It's the real thing alright.\nMaya:\nEarth to Nick! How long are you going to make two gorgeous women like us wait!?\nPearl:\nYes, Mr. Nick! I can't wait any longer! I want to see the exhibit!\nPhoenix:\n(*sigh* Looks like I don't get a choice here. Might as well head on out...)\nTreasure Exhibit Poster added to the Court Record.\nOctober 11, 7:18 PMLordly TailorMain Exhibition Hall\nPhoenix:\n(\"Lordly Tailor\"... The city's fanciest and most expensive department store. Treasure Exhibit, huh... I have to admit I'm pretty impressed.)\nMaya:\nWow... This is awesome!\nPhoenix:\nYeah... You can make even the cheapest junk look great... It all depends on how you display it.\nPearl:\nOh! They even have the dusty old hanging scroll that was in the Fey Manor storeroom!\nMaya:\nOh yeah, I remember scribbling on it when I was a little girl!\nPhoenix:\n(On a family heirloom...!?)\nMaya:\nSay, Nick... The person in charge of this exhibition is waiting for us in the basement warehouse.\nPhoenix:\nAlright... (I guess we should go and say hello...)\nExamine\nBlue board\nPhoenix:\nA piece of cloth with a ton of finely-written characters jammed onto it. Probably esoteric knowledge only mediums would know. ...Hmm, let's see... Here's the title in English... \"108 Ways to Save Money.\" ... I'm pretty sure the number has gone up since the last time I saw it.\nMaya:\nWell, we're always looking for new ways you know!\nPhoenix:\nBeing a medium sounds like a rough way of life...\nCushion\nPhoenix:\nWhat's with this big cushion? It's just lying around, with nothing on it.\nMaya:\nHmm... Well it must be for the greatest treasure of all!\nPhoenix:\n\"Greatest treasure\"...? Is there something like that?\nMaya:\nHuh? Why... Of course there is! Right, Pearly?\nPearl:\nOh! Um, yeah! Of course!\nMaya:\nYeah, I'll bet it would really take your breath away!\nFolding screen\nPhoenix:\nI think I remember this old folding screen here... I'm pretty sure it was an important piece of evidence... ...in that murder case that happened in Kurain Village.\nPearl:\nThis folding screen is the greatest of all the spirit channeling secrets... The Six Leaf Kurain Sacred Writings folding screen!\nPhoenix:\n(If it's so secret, why is it the most prominent thing in the exhibit?)\nUrns\nPhoenix:\nThey're just a bunch of old urns... Are these really \"treasures\", too?\nMaya:\nOf course they are! This is a \"Treasure Exhibit\", isn't it!?\nPhoenix:\nWell yeah, I guess so. ... (So all it takes to be a \"treasure\" is age? No wonder nobody like museums...)\nKurain Village diorama\nPearl:\nOh! Mystic Maya, look! I can't believe it!\nMaya:\nAh! It's so cute! It's a little diorama of Kurain Village!\nPhoenix:\n...Yeah, look at that. But somehow, it seems to reek of dreariness.\nPearl:\nOh! Mystic Maya, It's your house! It even says, \"Fey Manor\" on it!\nMaya:\nYikes! You're right! I kinda want to add \"The Famous\" in front of it!\nPhoenix:\nDon't do it, Maya. ...They might get mad.\nOctober 11Lordly TailorBasement Warehouse\nPhoenix:\n(Yup. This is a basement warehouse alright...)\nPearl:\nTh-This place is scary... I feel like a monster could jump out at any time...\nMaya:\nDon't be scared, Pearly! I'll protect you!\n???:\n...Oh... ...Mr. Wright.\nMaya:\nEeeeeeeek!! A monster! You were right!\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? A monster...?)\n???:\nGood evening. ...It's good to see you again.\nPhoenix:\nY-You... I know you...\n???:\nHa ha. Nice to see you again too, little miss.\nPearl:\nAh! H-Hello!\nMaya:\nIs she a friend of yours, Nick? ...And how do you know her, Pearly?\nAndrews:\nNice to meet you. I'm Adrian Andrews. I'm in charge of the promotion and planning for this Treasure Exhibit. I'm also responsible for the security arrangements.\nMaya:\nOh, um... N-Nice to meet you.\nPhoenix:\n(Adrian sure has changed since we last met...)\nAndrews:\nSo this is the warehouse. The really valuable exhibit items are still stored away in here.\nExamine\nSecurity camera\nPhoenix:\nIt's a security camera. It's trained on the warehouse door.\nAndrews:\nIt's set up to take a picture of anyone that enters or exits the door. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, they say.\nComputer\nPhoenix:\nThis computer... It looks like it's hooked up to the security camera above.\nMaya:\nAnd that means what?\nPhoenix:\nThe camera is set up to take a photo of anyone that goes in or out of the storeroom... Then the data from the camera gets uploaded to this computer here. That's what.\nMaya:\nI see... That's some pretty high-tech stuff.\nBig signboard\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like a part of a big signboard. All I can read on it is the \"bur\".\nMaya:\nAha! I've got it! Maybe it's supposed to say, \"Hamburger\"!\nPhoenix:\nWhy would anyone write \"Hamburger\" that big?\nMaya:\nLike, maybe for the \"World Hamburger Festival\" or something?\nPhoenix:\nI kinda doubt it.\nMaya:\nAha! I've got it! Maybe it said, \"Spaghetti\"!\nPhoenix:\n...Why are you talking about food? Oh, wait. That's normal for you. Anyway, it says, \"bur\". There's no way it could be \"Spaghetti\".\nMaya:\nWell, maybe it was a typo! It might have said, \"Spaghetti Festival\". What do you think?\nPhoenix:\nOK to me... Besides, Spaghetti is the only thing more tangled than your reasoning.\n(Step)ladder\nMaya:\nLook, a ladder!\nPhoenix:\nThat's a \"step\"-ladder.\nMaya:\nSo? What's the difference? You need to stop judging things based on narrow-minded cultural assumptions, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nR-Right... sorry. (Why do I feel like we've had this exact same conversation before somewhere...?)\nDoor to the storeroom\nPearl:\nMr. Nick, what's that big door over there?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like it's the door to the actual storeroom. I can see lots of big boxes and stuff back there.\nMaya:\nReally? Let's go in! I wanna take a look!\nAndrews:\nOh... I'm sorry! Unauthorized personnel aren't allowed in there.\nMaya:\n...Did you hear that, Nick? We're unauthorized personnel.\nPhoenix:\nWhy are you telling me that?\nAmi Fey statue\nPearl:\nMystic Maya! Take a look next to the door! That... That's Mystic Ami, right?\nAndrews:\nYes, that's a statue of the woman who invented the Kurain Channeling Technique, Ami Fey. This statue is on loan from one of the training halls of the Fey branch family. In fact, it just arrived this morning.\nAmi Fey's Golden Statue added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nWhat's that creepy-looking thing she's holding?\nMaya:\nDon't ask me! How should I know...?\nPhoenix:\n...Well, you ARE the future Master, right?\nMaya:\nMaybe so, but this is the first time I've ever seen this statue.\nAndrews:\nThat \"thing\" is the Kurain Shichishito. It's a ceremonial sword. It's not a real weapon, so the blade isn't sharp.\nMaya:\n...Aww, phooey. I wanted to cut something!\nPhoenix:\nWhy are you eyeing me for!?\nAmi Fey statue (subsequent times)\nPearl:\nMystic Maya! Take a look next to the door! That... That's Mystic Ami, right?\nAndrews:\nYes, that's a statue of the woman who invented the Kurain Channeling Technique, Ami Fey. This statue is on loan from one of the training halls of the Fey branch family. In fact, it just arrived this morning.\n\"ORGANI\" panels\nPhoenix:\nIt says \"ORGANI\".\nMaya:\nNo it doesn't, Nick! It says, \"ORGANIZE\"! You just can't see the last two letters.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, well I guess no one else could read it either, because this place is a mess.\nMaya:\nYeah. You must feel right at home, huh?\nTalk\nAdrian Andrews\nAndrews:\nIt really has been a long time, hasn't it, Mr. Wright?\nMaya:\nNick! What's going on!? Who is this woman!?\nPhoenix:\nWh-Why are you freaking out on me!? (Changed from [Wh-Why are you spazzing out on me!?] in the original release)\nMaya:\nWhat? I just thought it'd be more dramatic if I got all worked up. That's all.\nPearl:\nMystic Maya! You shouldn't let him of the hook so easily!\nPhoenix:\n(Please, Maya, don't say anything that'll needle Pearls further...)\nAndrews:\nMr. Wright was there for me when I really needed help. It... It was something that happened 7 months ago.\nPhoenix:\nYou remember, don't you? The \"Nickel Samurai\" case.\nMaya:\nNot really... I was stuck in a dark wine cellar... Did that escape your memory, Nick?\nAndrews:\nAfter that, I quit being a manager and started this job.\nPhoenix:\nWow, that's tough. I'm sorry, Ms. Andrews. If it wasn't for us...\nAndrews:\nNo! Don't say that! I'm glad the whole thing happened. Thanks to you and everyone else that was involved, I was able to change my whole life. ...I really am grateful.\nPhoenix:\n(Whew, that's a relief...)\nLordly Tailor\nPhoenix:\nI'm really impressed, Ms. Andrews. Handling a huge exhibition like this must be very tiring.\nAndrews:\nWell, Lordly Tailor is celebrating their 200th anniversary this year. The works on display in the main exhibition hall are worthy of the finest museums.\nMaya:\nWoohoo! Did you hear that, Pearly!? The finest museums!\nPearl:\nYes, I did! That's really wonderful.\nPhoenix:\nSo this basement warehouse is pretty well-protected, huh?\nAndrews:\n...Of course it is. After all, there are some priceless treasures here. The security guards are very highly trained as well...\nPhoenix:\n(That sounds good... So, what is with that face she's making...?)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nAndrews:\nI owe a great deal of thanks to that badge... ...It's the only reason that I'm still here today.\nPhoenix:\nOh, come on now. That's not true...\nMaya:\nI think what Nick means to say is, \"It wasn't thanks to the badge, it was thanks to ME!\" Tell the truth, Nick! I know that's what you were thinking!\nPhoenix:\nN-No way, Maya!\nTreasure Exhibit Poster\nAndrews:\nI wanted to do something nice for you and your friends, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nSo that's why you arranged this exhibit...?\nAndrews:\nI knew that Kurain Village was the hometown of your assistant, Maya. I thought it would be great to let the rest of the world know about it, too.\nPhoenix:\nHmm... But that's not exactly thanking me, per se, is it?\nMaya:\nMaybe, but who'd wanna see an exhibit on the \"Treasures of Phoenix Wright\"?\nPhoenix:\nI guess I can't argue with that one.\nPhoenix Wright profile\nAndrews:\nYou've certainly changed since I last saw you 7 months ago.\nPhoenix:\nR-Really?\nAndrews:\nYes, you look like you're bulked up a little.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, now that she mentions it... I guess I have gotten a little stronger...)\nMaya:\nYou're such a dork, Nick.\nAdrian Andrews profile\nAndrews:\nI've finally managed to put the events of 7 months ago behind me. I really love the work that I'm doing now... Honestly, I owe it all to you, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nOh, it was nothing.\nAndrews:\nAnd to this little girl, too.\nPearl:\nTh-Thank you for saying so!\nMaya:\n... ...I guess I wasn't much of a help, huh?\nAndrews:\nN-No, that's not true! You were ALL a big help to me!\nPhoenix:\n(She shouldn't take it so personally. It's not like she was exactly \"free\" to help...)\nAny other evidence\nPhoenix:\nUm... So what about this?\nAndrews:\nSorry I can't be of more help, but I really don't have anything to say about that.\nAny other profile\nAndrews:\nI'm sorry, I don't know as many people as I used to. So there really isn't anything I can tell you about that person.\nAfter clearing all Talk options and examining Ami Fey statue:\nAndrews:\nOh, look! It's already 8:00! Have you all eaten yet?\nPhoenix:\nUm, well actually...\nAndrews:\nI've already made a reservation at the restaurant on the 12th floor. Why don't we all dine together?\nMaya:\nOoh! I like the sound of that! \"Dine\"... It sounds so fancy!\nPearl:\nI'll have the \"Kid's Lunch\"!\nMaya:\nHa ha ha. Pearly, it's dinner, not lunch. Why don't you go for it and really eat your fill with a \"Kid's Dinner\"?\nPearl:\nOK! In that case, one \"Kid's Dinner\" for me!\nAndrews:\nHa ha. Shall we head upstairs, then?\nPhoenix:\nAfter that pleasant evening, all that remained was to wait for the exhibition's opening. It was wonderful seeing Ms. Andrews looking so happy. None of us could have imagined... ...that the very next day, something terrible would happen...\nOctober 12, 10:09 AMWright & Co. Law Offices\nMaya:\nN-Nick! This is terrible! ...What the--!? You're cleaning the toilet again!? I never knew you were such a toilet freak!\nPhoenix:\nGimme a break, would you? My brain just hit the snooze button for the fifth time...\nPearl:\nUm... I'm going to turn on the TV!\nAnnouncer:\n...We've got an update on the recent treasure heist! Based on clues found at the scene of the crime, authorities have announced... that they believe it was the work of the renowned phantom thief, Mask☆DeMasque!\nPhoenix:\n...M-Masque the Mask...?\nAnnouncer:\nAccording to a spokesperson, Lordly Tailor received a threat letter some days ago. This is the fifth heist by the phantom thief, who only targets rare treasures.\nPhoenix:\nL-Lordly Tailor...!?\nMaya:\nWell, Nick!? What are you going to do!? Don't you dare go back to scrubbing the toilet!\nPhoenix:\nTreasure...? Lordly Tailor...? You don't think...!?\nMaya:\nYes! Now, get up, Nick! It was stolen! By Mask☆DeMasque! Our most valuable treasure... The Kurain Sacred Urn was STOLEN!!\nPhoenix:\nWhaaat!?\nExamine\nWindow\nPhoenix:\nThere is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. The chain is getting so rich that they brought a whole chunk of the next town over... ...and started building a huge theme park. It's going to be called \"Gatewater Land\". ...And to think that two years ago, it was just a little hotel for businessmen.\nMovie poster\nPhoenix:\nAn old movie poster. Apparently, this was the first movie that made Mia cry when she saw it, a long time ago. Maya watched it recently, and said she cried all night, too! ...Which, I guess, is why it's back up on the wall. I'll have to check it out one of these days.\nCharley the plant\nPhoenix:\nCharley. A quite decorative plant. When she was alive, Mia really loved it. She even went so far as to make it our mascot. It must be nice to be a plant, being able to just sit in the sun and photosynthesize...\nMaya:\nHey! Nick! No time for daydreaming!\nPearl:\nThat's right, Mr. Nick! No time for daydreaming!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh man. Until I find that urn, they're not gonna give me a second of peace...)\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nIt's my desk. I don't get to use it much, so the dust bunnies are starting to mount their assault. Maybe I should wipe them out with a few well-placed swipes of my cleaning rag...\nMaya:\nHey! Nick! Are you trying to make me upset!?\nPearl:\nYeah, Mr. Nick! If you're worried about the cleaning, please leave it up to me!\nPhoenix:\n(At least Pearls is good at cleaning. *sigh* Guess I'd better go find that urn...)\nBookshelf\nPhoenix:\nDifficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. ...Actually, I've neglected them for so long that they're covered in a layer of dust. I guess I should at least read them once in a while.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! This is no time for reading!\nPearl:\nYes, Mr. Nick! You can always read later!\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I won't be getting any peace and quiet to even read until I find that urn...)\nTalk\nSacred Urn\nPhoenix:\nRefresh my memory a little... What's this \"Sacred Urn\"...?\nMaya:\nIt's only the most important treasure in Kurain Village! That's all! Look! It's right here on the poster! Don't you remember what's inside? The urn contains a very important soul! Namely, the soul of Mystic Ami Fey, the founder of the Kurain Channeling Technique! Right, Pearly?\nPearl:\nAh, yes! Th-That's right!\nMaya:\n... Hold up... I thought that urn had the name \"AMI\", written on it... Now it says \"I AM\"... Hm... Any idea how that happened, Pearly?\nPearl:\nHuh!? Um, I... W-Well... Tee hee... There are some things left unsolved, wouldn't you say, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(That's right! One year ago, there was a murder in Kurain Village, Maya's hometown. The Sacred Urn... It turned out to be an important clue in that case.)\nSacred Urn added to the Court Record.\nSacred Urn (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nRefresh my memory a little... What's this \"Sacred Urn\"...?\nMaya:\nIt's only the most important treasure in Kurain Village! That's all! Look! It's right here on the poster! Don't you remember what's inside? The urn contains a very important soul! Namely, the soul of Mystic Ami Fey, the founder of the Kurain Channeling Technique! Right, Pearly?\nPearl:\nAh, yes! Th-That's right!\nMaya:\n... Hold up... I thought that urn had the name \"AMI\", written on it... Now it says \"I AM\"... Hm... Any idea how that happened, Pearly?\nPearl:\nHuh!? Um, I... W-Well... Tee hee... There are some things left unsolved, wouldn't you say, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(That's right! One year ago, there was a murder in Kurain Village, Maya's hometown. The Sacred Urn... It turned out to be an important clue in that case.)\nWhat to do\nPhoenix:\nOK, the toilet is shinier than the judge's head, so let's see what's next...\nMaya:\nWhat's wrong with you, Nick!?\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean?\nMaya:\nWhat do you mean what do I--\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Your beloved Mystic Maya's treasure has been stolen! Doesn't that ever bother you!?\nPhoenix:\nBut I thought the urn was the village's treasure, so I don't see how...\nPearl:\nThe village IS Mystic Maya! She's the future master of the Kurain School of Channeling! You know what I'm talking about, Mr. Nick! I won't let you say you don't!\nPhoenix:\nO-OK OK! I do! ...So what am I supposed to do about it?\nPearl:\nIsn't it obvious? Go and find the bad guy who did this!\nMaya:\nYeah! And get the Sacred Urn back!\nPhoenix:\nB-But... I'm not a detective... I'm a lawyer--\nPearl:\nThat has nothing to do with this! If you're a real gentlemen, you would find it for your beloved Mystic Maya!\nPhoenix:\n(Man, oh man... There's no winning against Pearls's fairy-tale image if love...) ...So what's the name of this bad guy again?\nMaya:\nMask☆DeMasque, Nick! Make a note of it! Mask☆DeMasque!\nLast year's incident (appears after \"Sacred Urn\")\nMaya:\nAh, it was terrible! I was arrested and everything!\nPhoenix:\nOne year ago... The murder in Kurain Village. A man was killed during one of Maya's spirit channelings. And this urn wound up being the key piece of evidence that proved her innocence.\nPearl:\nUm... Mr. Nick? Would you mind not telling Maya about that? You promised, remember? You said you wouldn't tell anyone I broke the urn...\nPhoenix:\nOh yeah, that's right. (Now I remember. This urn used to say \"AMI\" on it... Until Pearls accidentally broke it into a million pieces. She tried to secretly fix it... Let's just say it didn't work out so well.)\nPearl:\nSorry... I'm not so good at arts and crafts... Spelling either...\nPhoenix:\n...Anyway, this is how her gluing project turned out. She put the pieces together wrong and now, instead of \"AMI\", it says, \"I AM\". ...I can't believe no one's noticed this until now, a whole year later.\nPearl:\nI can't believe it myself...\nPresent\nMagatama\nMaya:\nOh, hey! It's my Magatama! So what do you think, Nick? Isn't it neat?\nPhoenix:\nIt sure is. Being able to peek into people's minds is definitely a nice advantage.\nMaya:\nWhat? How do you do that!?\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean? You gave me this thing...\nMaya:\nWell, I knew Pearly put some sort of spiritual power into it... But I had no idea that it let you do something as cool as that!\nPhoenix:\n...Some future leader you are.\nMaya:\nNext time you use it, let me know, OK!? I want to see into people's minds, too!\nTreasure Exhibit Poster or Sacred Urn\nPhoenix:\nIs this thing really all that valuable? It looks kinda... well... junky, if you ask me.\nMaya:\nBut it's got the soul of Mystic Ami, the founder of our channeling technique!\nPhoenix:\nSo how much do you think you could get for it?\nMaya:\nWhat!? Sell the Sacred Urn!? You know, I never thought about that... Hey Pearly... Make a note of that. \"Ways to Save Money, Tip 109: Sell treasures whenever possible.\"\nPearl:\n...Whenever possible, check!\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow, I think Maya's going to be searching for a buyer for a long time...)\nAmi Fey's Golden Statue\nMaya:\nYou know, even I didn't know this statue existed until a little while ago.\nPhoenix:\nDidn't Adrian say it's from a Fey branch family's training hall or something?\nMaya:\nYes, there are actually a lot of training halls scattered all over the country. Hidden away deep in desolate mountains...\nPhoenix:\n(Why does it always have to be \"desolate\" mountains...?)\nPhoenix Wright profile\nMaya:\nYou're not very photogenic, are you?\nPhoenix:\n...!\nPearl:\nI guess that's the end of that conversation!\nMia Fey profile\nMaya:\nS-Sis... *sniffle* I really miss her...\nPearl:\nWas Mystic Mia... Was she a really good lawyer?\nMaya:\nYeah, she was awesome! She taught Nick everything he knows.\nPearl:\nYou should train hard and try to make her proud, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, I'll do my best.\nPearl:\nYou can join me on my next trip to a freezing waterfall!\nPhoenix:\n(I hate to break it to her, but I don't think being frozen to the bone helps in court...)\nMaya Fey profile\nMaya:\nI'm going to have to really buckle down and get serious.\nPhoenix:\nWell, you're the future Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique, after all.\nMaya:\nYeah... That, and I have to play the part of big sister, too. For Pearly... and you, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nWha-?? Do I look like I was born yesterday!?\nPearl Fey profile\nMaya:\nPearly is such a cutie, isn't she Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYup.\nMaya:\nAnd she's smart too, just like yours truly! She's got quite a future ahead of her! I bet she could be President some day!\nPhoenix:\n(A President that can channel past Presidents... Hmm... That just might come in handy...)\nAdrian Andrews profile\nMaya:\nShe certainly seems grateful to you, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWell, she was in a pretty tight spot during that terrible ordeal. Actually, I'm grateful to her, too.\nMaya:\nHmm... It sounds like you're not telling me something. I'm going to take a good look at the case file next chance I get...\nAny other evidence\nPhoenix:\nSo, what do you think about this?\nMaya:\nHmm... What about it, Pearly?\nPearl:\nI'm not certain. What do you think, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe three heads aren't better than one...)\nAny other profile\nPhoenix:\nSo, what do you think about this person?\nMaya:\nHmm... What do you think, Pearly?\nPearl:\nI'm not certain. What do you think, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(I think the saying I'm looking for is, \"never seen them before in my life\"...)\nOctober 12Lordly TailorMain Exhibition Hall\nPearl:\nRight! Let's see if we can find some clues that might lead us to the bad guy!\nPhoenix:\n...But it doesn't look like anything has been disturbed.\nMaya:\nYeah, it looks pretty much the same as it did last night.\nPearl:\nHmmm... Bad guy, huh.\n???:\nHey! You can't poke around here, pal!\nPhoenix:\nWait a minute... that voice. Oh no! Not him again!\n???:\nIt's YOU!! And I'm the one who should be saying \"not again\"! Why is it that every time something bad happens, you always show up, pal?\nPhoenix:\nI should be asking you that. Aren't there any other detectives?\n???:\nNo, I should be asking YOU that. What are you doing hanging around here?\nPhoenix:\nHey, I asked you first. Why are you here any--\nMaya:\nAlright, alright, we got it! Why don't you two kiss and make up already?\nPearl:\n...Um, hello. It's been a long time, Mr. Scruffy Detective!\n???:\nOh! It's you, little missy! ...Um, ahh...\nGumshoe:\nActually, my name is Gumshoe. \"Detective Dick Gumshoe\"! Now is a good chance for you to try to remember it right!\nMaya:\nAnd if it's too long for you, you can just call him \"Dick\".\nPearl:\nOkay! It's good to see you again, Mr. Detective Dick!\nGumshoe:\nUm... Yeah... Good to see you again, too, I guess.\nTalk\nWhat happened\nPearl:\nUmm, Mr. Detective Dick! Can you tell us about what happened?\nGumshoe:\nOh, you're trying to remember my name! Atta girl! ...Um, just... It's \"Gumshoe\", OK? Anyway, the thief stole something called the \"Sacred Urn\"...\nPearl:\nI know about that.\nGumshoe:\nOh. W-Well, the criminal's name is Mask☆DeMasque...\nPearl:\nI know about that, too.\nMaya:\nDetective, can't you tell us something other than that?\nGumshoe:\nW-Well... I guess I sorta kinda owe you guys... in a way... The crime occurred last night at around 1:30 in the morning.\nPhoenix:\nHow exactly do you know that?\nGumshoe:\nWe got an emergency phone call from a guard at the scene of crime, pal. He said, \"The urn was just stolen!\"\nMaya:\nThe scene of the crime... You mean here, right?\nGumshoe:\nWrong. That urn was being kept under careful guard in the basement warehouse.\nPhoenix:\n(Basement warehouse, huh...)\nPearl:\nUmm, so who was guarding the basement warehouse...?\nGumshoe:\nThat guy! It's all his fault that the thief got away, pal! He solves one case and gets a swelled head, thinking that he's an Ace Detective!\nMaya:\nA-Ace Detective...?\nMask☆DeMasque\nPhoenix:\nHey, Detective Gumshoe, about this Mask☆DeMasque... Is he famous?\nMaya:\nWhaaaat!? You're joking, right Nick? Mask☆DeMasque is the hottest thing since sliced bread!\nGumshoe:\nSometimes he appears as a museum guard! Sometimes he appears as a big brown bear known to surprise unsuspecting victims. But underneath those disguises is... the true Mask☆DeMasque!\nPhoenix:\n...So he's some kind of master of disguise, huh.\nGumshoe:\nAnd he only goes after the finest work of art, pal. Last night was his 5th heist! If Lordly Tailor had only cooperated, I could have caught him this time...\nMaya:\nWhat!? Then you knew he was planning on stealing the Sacred Urn!?\nGumshoe:\nOf course I did! The guy always sends his calling card before he steals something.\nPhoenix:\n(Calling card, huh... They mentioned that on TV...)\nAce Detective (appears after \"What happened\")\nPhoenix:\nSo why do you call him an \"Ace Detective\" anyway?\nGumshoe:\nThat's what he calls himself, pal... I didn't make it up.\nMaya:\nSo? What's he like?\nGumshoe:\nWell, like I told you, Mask☆DeMasque has made five heists so far. On the 4th heist, Mr. Ace Detective managed to get the stolen treasure back.\nPearl:\nWow, that is impressive! All by himself!?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. I gotta admit it, pal. Maybe he really is as good as he says. Every time the thief sends one of his calling cards, we send our men on a stakeout... But none of us has ever gotten so much as a glimpse of the guy...\nPearl:\nBut Mr. Ace Detective was able to retrieve the stolen treasure from the thief...\nGumshoe:\nAnyway, he's at the scene of crime right now, looking for clues.\nPhoenix:\n(So he's down in the basement warehouse, huh...?)\nCalling card (appears after \"Mask☆DeMasque\")\nPhoenix:\nSo what's this \"calling card\"?\nGumshoe:\nHere it is. But don't show it to anyone! It's top-secret, OK, pal?\nPhoenix:\nWhat's this mark on the front?\nGumshoe:\nThat's Mask☆DeMasque's signature emblem, pal. You could say it's his \"mark\". All of his calling cards have got it on them.\nMaya:\nThey didn't mention THAT on the news flash.\nGumshoe:\nWe're withholding that detail from the public for \"operational reasons\"... The only way we can tell if a calling card is real or not is by this emblem.\nCalling Card added to the Court Record.\nMaya:\n...That makes sense. When you get famous, there are always imitators.\nPearl:\nMr. Nick, if you work a little harder, maybe you can have your own copycats someday!\nPhoenix:\nUm, uh, thanks... I guess.\nCalling card (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nSo what's this \"calling card\"?\nGumshoe:\nHere it is. But don't show it to anyone! It's top-secret, OK, pal?\nPhoenix:\nWhat's this mark on the front?\nGumshoe:\nThat's Mask☆DeMasque's signature emblem, pal. You could say it's his \"mark\".

I guess.\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nPhoenix:\nHere, take a look at my attorney's badge.\nGumshoe:\nAre you still showing that cheap little thing off? A real man keeps his mouth shut... and carries a suave police badge, pal.\nTreasure Exhibit Poster or Sacred Urn\nGumshoe:\n...To be honest, pal, there's something that bugs me.\nPhoenix:\nWhat's that?\nGumshoe:\nAll the other items that were stolen by Mask☆DeMasque were ones even I had heard of. They were all world-famous treasures. The \"Tear of Emanon\" or the \"Crown of Bongora\"...\nMaya:\nThe \"Sacred Urn of Kurain\" is famous, too! ...Right, Pearly!?\nPearl:\nOf course! Everyone in Kurain Village knows about it!\nPhoenix:\n(Sounds like we've got an unpredictable thief on our hands...)\nDeMasque's Calling Card\nGumshoe:\nRemember! Don't tell anyone about that emblem. OK, pal?\nPhoenix:\nDoes the thief ever send these to the police?\nGumshoe:\nNo, always to the victims. Up until now, the victims have always come to us looking for help though.\nMaya:\n...That's not what happened this time, you mean?\nGumshoe:\nYou got that right, pal. Listen up! If you guys ever get one of these calling cards... ...I want you to come to us right away! Got me?\nPhoenix:\n...Yeah, sure.\nPhoenix Wright profile\nGumshoe:\nPretty goofy-looking face, if you ask me.\nPhoenix:\nHey...!\nMaya:\nWhat are you doing carrying that around with you anyway? It's not like we ever need it.\nPhoenix:\n(She has got a point...)\nMia Fey profile\nGumshoe:\nOh! That's Ms. Mia Fey! She was a truly beautiful person, pal.\nMaya:\nHuh? You knew her? You knew my sis?\nGumshoe:\nSure. Everybody in the police force knew her. ...We all lost a great friend that day...\nPearl:\nMr. Scruffy Detective...\nGumshoe:\nI-I just got something in my eye...! ...I'm not crying!\nMask☆DeMasque profile\nGumshoe:\nI've been on this guy's tail ever since his first heist, pal!\nMaya:\nYeah, you're doing a really great job. I can see.\nGumshoe:\n...Oof! Listen pal, if you wanna jump high, first you gotta crouch down, right? I'm a little frustrated now, but it'll make it that much sweeter when I catch him! ...Anyway, that's what I keep telling myself every day.\nPearl:\nWell good luck, Mr. Detective Dick! I believe in you!\nGumshoe:\nAww, ain't you sweet. You're the only one that's ever said that!\nPhoenix:\n(...The only one? That's kinda sad if you think about it.)\nAny other evidence\nPhoenix:\nUmm, what about this...?\nGumshoe:\n...Sorry, pal. I didn't get much sleep last night and my brain's not really working right.\nMaya:\nSomehow I don't think sleep would really fix the problem.\nPhoenix:\nHey, keep it down. He might have really good hearing for all you know, and might get mad if he heard.\nGumshoe:\nUmmm... I can hear everything you are saying, pal.\nAny other profile\nPhoenix:\nUmm, what about this person...?\nGumshoe:\n...Sorry, pal. I didn't get much sleep last night and my brain's not really working right.\nMaya:\nSomehow I don't think sleep would really fix the problem.\nPhoenix:\nHey, keep it down. He might have really good hearing for all you know, and might get mad if he heard.\nGumshoe:\nUmmm... I can hear everything you are saying, pal.\nAfter clearing \"What happened\" Talk option in Lordly Tailor - Main Exhibition Hall:\nOctober 12Lordly TailorBasement Warehouse\nMaya:\nNo matter how many times we come here, this place always give me the chills.\nPhoenix:\nThat's probably because it's air-conditioned... To protect the art pieces, you know.\n???:\n...Welcome! To my private little \"Banquet of Chaos\".\nPhoenix:\n(Huh? What the heck does THAT mean...?)\n???:\nI'm afraid I have very little to offer, but please... make yourself at home.\nMaya:\nErr, umm... Who are you anyway...?\n???:\nSHHH! SILENCE! ... Hee hee hee hee hee hee... Now I see! It's all becoming clear!\nMaya:\nWh-What do you see?\n???:\n...Zvarri! The truth has once again been elegantly revealed to me! A lawyer, and... a spirit medium. Neither very advanced at their trade! ...Am I wrong?\nMaya:\nYikes! Th-That's scary! H-How did you know that!?\n???:\n\"How\" you say? The universal skeptic would say that how is nothing but a question of why. I am traveler of both time and space, and a swimmer of dreams.\nMaya:\nWhat is he talking about? I can't make heads or tails of it...\n???:\nWithout further ado, let me fulfill what should be the first duty of any gentleman...\nAtmey:\n...and introduce myself. The name is Atmey... Luke Atmey! ...Ace Detective.\nPhoenix:\nOh... Umm... Hi.\nMaya:\nDon't let him intimidate you, Nick! Stand up and show him what you're made of!\nPhoenix:\nErr, umm... The name's Wright. Phoenix Wright... ...Ace Attorney.\nMaya:\nI'm Maya Fey! Ace Spirit Medium!\nPearl:\nAnd I'm, ummm... Pearl Fey. I'm Mystic Maya's cousin and umm... spirit medium Ace Apprentice.\nAtmey:\nExcellent! Well then, shall we begin our little game?\nPhoenix:\n(\"Game\"? Why does the phrase \"one short of a baker's dozen\" come to mind with this guy?)\nExamine\nAnywhere\nAtmey:\nTsk! Sir Lawyer! Please refrain from such crude behavior.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Wh-What do you mean?\nAtmey:\nThis criminal is an artist! The crime scene is the canvas upon which he paints! Only I, Ace Detective Atmey, have an eye which is educated enough to read the signs!\nMaya:\n...Could you translate that for me, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI think he pretty much said, \"Don't touch anything amateurs!\"\nAtmey:\nIf there's something you wish to know about, you have but to ask Atmey! ...I know everything there is to know about my rival, Mask☆DeMasque.\nPhoenix:\n(What do I do now...?)\nMaya:\nDoes he have any top-secret information? Stuff that only a real crime buff would know?\nPhoenix:\n(I'll think about what to ask while I listen to what Mr. Ace Detective has to say...)\nTalk\nAce Detective\nPhoenix:\nUmm... So are you really as famous as you say?\nAtmey:\nOf course! For a lawyer, you have a rather shocking lack of knowledge about the world. I had no idea anyone was left in this city that had not heard of me! Look at me! I am Mask☆DeMasque's arch-enemy, the Ace Detective Luke Atmey! At this moment, there are two mighty figures which loom large over this grand city! One embodies the nefarious forces of darkness. The other the angelic cherubs of light!\nMaya:\n...Boy, now I'm really lost. What is he saying, Nick?\nAtmey:\nI have been personally on the heels of this villain since his first crime. After learning this criminal's patterns, I thwarted his very latest loathsome larceny! I even returned the target of his tyranny, the \"Portrait of Mejeena\" to the crime scene! And I did it all by myself! I took it back from Mask☆DeMasque... With my brawny mind and my brilliant muscles!\nMaya:\nYeah! They mentioned it on the news, in the \"Great People Around Town\" segment. (Changed from [Yeah! They mentioned it on the news, in the 'Great People of the Town' segment.] in the original release) They said that the museum gave you an incredible jewel as a reward!\nAtmey:\n...Well, compared to the treasure that I retrieved for them, it's not much.\nPhoenix:\n(So... in the end, the only thing that makes you great is your own self-praise...)\nMask☆DeMasque\nMaya:\nOh! Tell us what you know about Mask☆DeMasque! ...And keep it simple, please!\nAtmey:\nLike about how I have devoted my life to thwarting his dastardly deeds? Last night, here in the bowels of this store, we were locked in a most glorious battle.\nPhoenix:\nI see... ...Huh!? Hang on a second! You were here last night? Here? In Lordly Tailor!?\nAtmey:\nNaturally! Wherever DeMasque goes, you will find Atmey laying his elegant traps.\nPhoenix:\n(Elegant traps? More like DeMasque out-eleganced you and made a beautiful getaway.)\nAtmey:\nBut this time, I allowed him to escape with the illusion of victory.\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if I should ask him about what happened last night in more detail...)\nThe night of the crime (appears after \"Mask☆DeMasque\")\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Can you tell us exactly what happened here last night?\nAtmey:\nBut of course. After all, I always say there should be no secrets between \"aces\".\nPhoenix:\n(Flattery will get you nowhere, Pinocchio...)\nAtmey:\nI first received the request for my services 20 days ago. And it was 10 days ago that we received Mask☆DeMasque's calling card...\nMaya:\nHuh? You were hired BEFORE the calling card even arrived?\nAtmey:\nYes. You see, the person who hired me is quite rigorous and thorough.\nPhoenix:\n(That's Adrian for you...)\nAtmey:\nA mere 10 days after hiring me, her worst premonitions were realized!\nMaya:\nA calling card arrived, right?\nAtmey:\nYes! So, Ace Detective that I am, I set a trap for the thief right in the warehouse. And waited for him... alone.\nMaya:\nAlone? ...But why? Why didn't you go to the police for help?\nAtmey:\nRidiculous! Why would I seek help from such a singularly useless group of nincompoops?\nPhoenix:\n(You've got a lot of nerve. After all, it was you that let DeMasque get away.)\nAtmey:\nI always operate alone and concealed. Out of the sight of others.\nPearl:\n...? \"Corn Sealed\"...?\nAtmey:\nPrecisely! Even the guards on duty here were unaware of my presence. \"To fool your enemies, first you must fool your friends.\" It's my own original proverb!\nMaya:\nAnyway, back to what happened last night...\nAtmey:\nAs I was saying, I hid here in the warehouse and waited for the thief to arrive. But I swear to you... Not a solitary soul came through that entrance! Nevertheless... The Sacred Urn disappeared!\nPhoenix:\nB-But that's impossible! How could it just disappear!?\nAtmey:\n\"How?\" you ask? Don't be ridiculous, Sir Lawyer. If I knew the answer to that question, I wouldn't be here!\nPhoenix:\n(For someone who seriously messed up his own stakeout, he's rather full of himself.)\nPearl:\nSo you're saying that even though on [sic] one came through those doors last night... ...our precious urn still somehow vanished from under your nose?\nPhoenix:\n(Th-That's just not possible!)\nPresent\nTreasure Exhibit Poster or Sacred Urn\nAtmey:\nDo not fear, young lady. I promise I shall retrieve your urn!\nMaya:\nThank you, Detective Atmey! I'm counting on you!\nAtmey:\nThe final round between Detective Luke Atmey and Mask☆DeMasque is set to begin.\nPhoenix:\nStill, there's something funny about this guy...\nMaya:\nYeah, but don't forget he managed to retrieve the treasure from the last heist.\nAtmey:\nYes, I even have a video that details my role in the whole affair. I recorded it directly from the news on TV. Can I interest you in a copy?\nPhoenix:\n...No thanks.\nDeMasque's Calling Card\nPhoenix:\nMask☆DeMasque's calling card... It's got his emblem printed on it, right?\nAtmey:\n...Quite impressive! But I would expect nothing less from my arch-rival! I'm surprised to see you in possession of such a top-secret piece of information.\nMaya:\nWell, we've got an Ace Lawyer, an Ace Spirit Medium and an Ace Cousin-Apprentice here.\nAtmey:\nYes, indeed... I think I could learn to like you, my fellow ace professionals!\nPhoenix:\n(I don't know if I really want this guy to like us... ever.)\nPhoenix Wright profile\nPhoenix:\nThat's pretty amazing the way you were able to tell what I do for a living.\nAtmey:\nOh, it's elementary, my dear Wright, elementary. If you're really interested, the first clue was the hair. ...It points backward. It shows you're prepared to take on an attack. Such as from a criminal, for example. From your clothes, I knew you weren't a policeman, so I deduced you were a lawyer. After a combination of cold logic and intuition... Zvarri! Only the truth remains.\nPhoenix:\n(Wow, impressive...)\nMaya:\nOr maybe he just took a look at the attorney's badge on your lapel, genius.\nMia Fey profile\nAtmey:\nThis woman... She is a true beauty.\nPhoenix:\n...You don't say.\nAtmey:\nI would be honored if you would introduce her to me.\nPhoenix:\n...\nAtmey:\nI assure you, Sir Lawyer, that my interest is strictly professional!\nMaya:\nEww, this guy's even creepier than I thought.\nAtmey:\nI assure you, my dear, all Ace Detectives are perfect gentlemen!\nMaya Fey profile\nMaya:\nUmm... So how did you know I was a spirit medium?\nAtmey:\nOh, that was child's play. First, your hair. It's not of the type one sees every day. Both rare and enchanting... Almost... otherworldly. I thought it likely that you were either a fortune teller or a spirit medium. But I didn't quite detect the wisdom one usually sees in a fortune teller... And so... Zvarri! That left only one possibility.\nMaya:\nWell, they also have a bio about me on the Treasure Exhibit Poster...\nPearl Fey profile\nAtmey:\nAs for this child... Zvarri! Elementary school student.\nPearl:\nWow! That's right!\nAtmey:\nI can also see that you will be a middle-school student within the next few years!\nPearl:\nTh-That's incredible!\nPhoenix:\n(No doubt about it. This guy is good!)\nAtmey:\nNow you can see how I have earned my reputation as an Ace Detective.\nAdrian Andrews profile\nAtmey:\nAh, the charming young lady responsible for security, Ms. Adrian Andrews.\nMaya:\nHuh? You know her?\nAtmey:\nYes, well I should... She was the person who hired me for this job. A very intelligent woman. After all, she hired Detective Luke Atmey, did she not?\nPhoenix:\n(...I'm not entirely convinced that was an intelligent move on her part.)\nDick Gumshoe profile\nAtmey:\n...Oh, him. Yes, well I saw him earlier. That wretched detective has let the thief slip through his fingers every single time.\nMaya:\nWretched, huh...\nAtmey:\n...Now that I think about it, I wonder if they aren't working together.\nPhoenix:\nHuh...?\nAtmey:\nIf you ask me, Luke Atmey, I believe the two of them are \"co-conspirators\".\nMaya:\nIf Detective Gumshoe heard that, he'd probably cry.\nPhoenix:\nHe is a surprisingly sensitive guy...\nMask☆DeMasque profile\nAtmey:\nThis will surely be Mask☆DeMasque's final heist! Last time I came close and managed to retrieve the stolen treasure! Mark my words, this criminal of humanity will be found guilty in due time! And then I, Luke Atmey, Ace Detective, will dance with joy!\nPhoenix:\nI have no clue what you're blabbering about... But I guess I'll find out soon.\nLuke Atmey profile\nAtmey:\nThis person is... Zvarri! A great Ace Detective! Am I correct?\nPhoenix:\nUm, but I was the one asking you...\nAtmey:\nThis photo simply isn't enough information. I'm afraid I can't be absolutely certain... But the intelligence in those eyes indicates a man of deep wisdom and insight.\nMaya:\nStop messing around, Nick, and just ask him already!\nPhoenix:\nB-But this guy is scary.\nAnything else\nAtmey:\n...I'm sorry I can't be more helpful. But I have no interest save that of finding evidence against my arch-rival!\nMaya:\nNah, it's OK. Nick is just a bit of a piddling evidence hog. That's his defense style.\nAtmey:\nA \"piddling evidence hog\", you say? In that case, I'd simply be wasting my breath!\nMaya:\nYeah, I guess you're right.\nPhoenix:\nThanks, Maya. Why couldn't you have said I was a \"rival\", and not a \"piddling evidence hog\"?\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting DeMasque's Calling Card:\nAtmey:\n... ...Well, Sir Lawyer. I've been told that you too are pursuing the mysterious thief.\nPhoenix:\n...Well, I'm not sure would say that exact--\nMaya:\nThat's right! We're going to find the Sacred Urn no matter what we have to do!\nAtmey:\n...Excellent. I will trust you. I permit you to take a look around while I investigate elsewhere. If, perchance, you should discover something of value, return then to my office... My office of Earthly Delights, the \"Atmey Detective Agency\"! (Changed from [To my office of Earthly Delights, the 'Atmey Detective Agency'!] in the original release)\nMaya:\nOf-Office of Earthly D-Delights...?\nAtmey:\nWell then Sir Lawyer, if you'll excuse me, I have much to do!\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait a minute...!\nPearl:\nHe's gone.\nPhoenix:\nI don't like the idea of doing this guy's work for him.\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick. Don't worry about it. It's no big deal. Let's hurry up and investigate before he changes his mind!\nPearl:\nI wanna go to his office, too! Take me with you, OK?\nExamine\nSecurity camera\nPhoenix:\nIt's a security camera. It's trained on the big door to the storeroom. It's set up to take a photo of anyone that goes in or out.\nPearl:\nA \"se-kure-ity\" camera...?\nMaya:\nYeah, go stand in front of that door and it'll snap your photo too, Pearly.\nPearl:\nUmm... Mystic Maya... Do you think I should smile?\nMaya:\nNah. It's for criminals, so I think you should make a really scary face!\nPearl:\nL-Like this...?\nComputer\nMaya:\nHey, Pearly, do you know what this is? It's a computer!\nPearl:\nA \"kom-pu-ter\"...? Oh! I've heard of those! It has such a cute name!\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like this computer is for storing the data from the security camera. When someone comes in or out of the warehouse, the camera takes a photo of them.\nPearl:\nIt's probably the \"trap\" that the detective set up.\nMaya:\nLet's see if we can find last night's data on this thing. We might even find a photo of Mask☆DeMasque!\nPhoenix:\nHmm, let see here... (Man, I really stink at working these things...) ...\nPearl:\nWhat's wrong, Mr. Nick? You're sweating an awful lot.\nPhoenix:\n...I don't know how to pull up the photos...\nMaya:\nI had no idea you were so pathetic with high-tech stuff, Nick!\nPhoenix:\n...Yeah, well I managed to print out the camera data anyway.\nMaya:\nI guess you have to learn to crawl before you can walk, right, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, sure... Anyway, it looks like the camera only went off once last night.\nCamera Data added to the Court Record.\nComputer (subsequent times)\nMaya:\nHey, Pearly, do you know what this is?

When someone comes in or out of the warehouse, the camera takes a photo of them.\nPearl:\nIt's probably the \"trap\" that the detective set up.\nWooden box\nPhoenix:\nThat pathetic-looking wooden box...\nMaya:\nAhh!! That's the box that had the Sacred Urn on it!\nPhoenix:\nDon't touch it! There may be clues to the thief's identity on there!\nMaya:\nGrr... I worked so hard to make that box!\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? You MADE that poor excuse for a box, Maya?\nMaya:\nWhat's that supposed to mean!?\nPearl:\nThat urn has always been on its stand in the Winding Way of Fey Manor. So there was no box suitable for it, Mr. Nick.\nMaya:\nAnd I-I was so proud of it... *sniffle sniffle*\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Maya. Maybe it'd have been better if Mask☆DeMasque had taken the box, too...)\nShichishito\nMaya:\nWow, this is awesome. What did Ms. Andrews say it was called again?\nPhoenix:\n\"Shichishito\". It's literally \"7 Branch Sword\" in Japanese. Or so says Ms. Andrews. Whoa... It's pretty heavy.\nMaya:\n\"One hit, seven times the fun!\" Pretty catchy, huh? I bet it'd sell like hotcakes!\nPearl:\nUm, there's something about it that bothers me...\nMaya:\nWow! You're really firing on all cylinders today, Pearly!\nPearl:\nThis sword... Wasn't Mystic Ami holding it last night?\nMaya:\nAh...\nPearl:\nAnd another thing... The sword wasn't bent last night like it is now.\nPhoenix:\nY-You're right...\nMaya:\nAwesome, Pearly! I wouldn't expect any less from my little Ace Apprentice!\nPhoenix:\n(The sword is bent, so that must mean... Last night, someone \"used it\" somehow...)\nMaya:\nAha. I just thought of something! Maybe Detective Atmey smashed Mask☆DeMasque with it. Like this!\nPhoenix:\nYEOOOOOUCCCH!! WHAT THE HECK!\nMaya:\nWhat do you think, Pearly?\nPearl:\nI think it's even more bent than it was before.\nPhoenix:\n(Oh man... My head...

MY HAIR!)\nDoor to the storeroom\nPearl:\nMr. Nick, what's that big door over there?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like it's the door to the actual storeroom. I can see lots of big boxes and stuff back there.\nMaya:\nI guess that's where they were keeping the Sacred Urn.\nPhoenix:\nRemember, Maya. Ms. Andrews said we're not allowed in there.\nSpilled paint\nMaya:\nLook what you did, Nick! You spilled paint over here!\nPhoenix:\nI didn't do that!\nMaya:\nWell it wasn't here last night. I would have noticed a color this outrageous.\nPearl:\nBut this paint has already dried up.\nMaya:\nWell then, you should have cleaned it up before it dried, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nPaint doesn't dry that fast! Besides, I told you it wasn't me! (It looks like it's been several days since it was spilt.) Hey, look at this!\nPearl:\nWhat is it?\nPhoenix:\nThere's some kind of shape left in the bottom left side of this stain.\nMaya:\nHuh? ...You're right. I wonder what it could be...?\nAmi Fey statue\nMaya:\nThis statue of Mystic Ami is sooo cool. I want a gold statue of myself! We could put it in the office!\nPhoenix:\nHey! It's WRIGHT & Co.!

Was this where it was last night?\nMaya:\nAh...\nPearl:\nI'm pretty sure it was closer to the door...\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, I think you're right.\nMaya:\nGreat job, Pearly!

I think it's probably for purifying the air or something. I'll bet you 50 cents! Come on, what do you say?\nPhoenix:\nForget it. You never pay up when you lose.\nLuke Atmey painting\nPhoenix:\nWhat a creepy painting. It's like he's looking right at me.\nMaya:\nMaybe we should put up a big portrait of you in the office, Nick! I can even paint it for you. Maybe you can pose while cleaning the toilet?\nPhoenix:\n...I think I'd prefer something a bit more dignified.\nFireplace\nMaya:\nWhoa! It's a huge hearth!\nPhoenix:\nThat's a fireplace.\nMaya:\nSo? What's the difference? You need to stop judging things based on narrow-minded cultural assumptions, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nR-Right... sorry.\nBookshelf\nPhoenix:\nThat's one impressive bookshelf filled with some very impressive books!\nMaya:\n\"My Life as an Ace Detective: Unabridged Edition\" by Luke Atmey, Ace Detective.\nPhoenix:\nHey, he's even got one of those ships in a bottle thingies.\nMaya:\nAh! Would you look at that! There's a little Luke Atmey doll at the helm! How cute!\nPhoenix:\nThere's a microscope here, too. I wonder if he was researching something. The glass slides have different names on them.\nMaya:\nThis one says... \"Atmey Virus\", ...Hmm. This guy is just dying to make a name for himself, huh.\nPhoenix:\nIt's getting kind of irritating, actually.\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nThis desk is literally covered with all sorts of chemistry equipment.\nMaya:\nOh, I just love chemistry! Say, Nick, I bet you didn't know this, but... Water is made up of carbon and hydrogen!\nPhoenix:\nNo, no, no. Not carbon! Oxygen! Oxygen and hydrogen!\nMaya:\nOh? Well, there are always alternative theories, I guess.\nPhoenix:\n(If by \"alternative theories\" you mean the ones you make up inside that head of yours.)\nOctober 12\nDetention CenterVisitor's Room\nGumshoe:\nHey, pal! Welcome to the detention center!\nPhoenix:\nYou're sure in a happy mood, aren't you?\nGumshoe:\nYup. After all, we got Mask☆DeMasq--\nMaya:\nRight, but... Um... So where's the Sacred Urn?\nGumshoe:\nOh, Sorry about that, pal... I guess I didn't really think about it before... But you're the \"victim\" in this case.\nMaya:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nWell, I guess I should let you guys hear the story straight from the horse's mouth.\nMaya:\nYou know, he's right, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nHe is?\nMaya:\nIf you think about it reeeeal hard, we are the victims!\nPhoenix:\nWell... I guess so... In a way...\n???:\nUmm...\nMaya:\nI'm so used to thinking of the victim as a dead person 'cause we're always on murder cases.\n???:\nEx-Excuse me...\nMaya:\nBut anyway! I have to get the Sacred Urn back!\n???:\nPleeeeease! Don't just ignore meeeeee! ...Err.\nMaya:\n...Um, who are you?\n???:\n...I, err, umm. I-I-I... I-I'm Ma-Ma-Ma... Mask☆DeMasque...? ...O-OK?\nMaya:\n... Hey, Nick... Doesn't he look kind of... well, gangly?\nRon:\nI'm Ron DeLite... Th-The famous Mask☆DeMasque.\nPhoenix:\n(...I don't think this guy could punch his way out of a wet paper bag.)\nExamine\nSecurity camera\nPhoenix:\nSmile, you're on candid camera.\nSecurity guard\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room. He looks nervous being this close to an alleged thief.\nTalk\nMask☆DeMasque\nPhoenix:\nSo, you're the Masque DeMask guy?\nRon:\nY-Yes! You bet! ... No... Err, that's wrong. You see... it's complicated. Sort of yes, and sort of no. If you know what I mean\nPearl:\nHm? What's wrong?\nRon:\nWell when I say \"wrong\", what I really mean to say is that it's \"not right\", per se. You see it's not spelled \"Masque DeMask\", it's actually \"Mask☆DeMasque\"...\nMaya:\n...What's with this guy?\nPhoenix:\n(Well, he's a timid little weakling, we know that much.)\nRon:\nD-Don't do that... Don't look at me like that! I don't need your pityyyyy!\nPhoenix:\n(And a major crybaby, too.) So... Why did you give yourself up?\nRon:\nWell, you see... It's because... Well...\nMaya:\nI know why! It's because you stole such a priceless treasure! And now you're overwhelmed with guilt. Am I right!?\nPhoenix:\n(\"Priceless treasure\"? That broken old urn...?)\nRon:\nUmm... I have a little favor to ask...\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes? What is it?\nRon:\nCould you... go and talk to Dessie?\nMaya:\n...D-Dessie?\nSacred Urn\nMaya:\nLook, we really want our urn back, so where is it?\nRon:\nI'm sorry! I'll give it back! I really will! ...Err, maybe not. No, I can't... I can't make promises I can't keep... I'll just end up hurting people\nPearl:\nUm, Mr. Nick...? I couldn't hear what he just said... Especially the last part.\nPhoenix:\nUm, Mr. DeMasque? Do you think you could speak up a little?\nRon:\nY-Y-Y-Yes, sir! I will... I promise! ...Err, maybe not. You see, I'm already speaking in my normal voice, so I really can't do anything\nMaya:\nMr. DeMasque? About the urn...\nRon:\nOh! Yes! The urn! Right away! ...Err, actually no. I wouldn't mind telling you, but actually I'm afraid you wouldn't believe me anyway\nMaya:\nEnough already! Just tell it to us straight!\nRon:\nPlease... Please don't yell at meeee! *huff huff huff* I... I... I'm sorry... That urn... I... I-I lost it!\nMaya:\nWh-Wha-What!?\nLost it? (appears after \"Sacred Urn\")\nPhoenix:\nWhat did you just say? Did you say you \"lost it\"?\nRon:\nYes... Er, no. Umm... Maybe so. I mean, yes, I lost it!\nMaya:\nWh-What do you mean...?\nRon:\nWell, you know... I lost it, like I said... These things just happen... You're on the train and you get distracted and you forgot your bag. You know...\nMaya:\nWhat!? You forgot our Sacred Urn on a train!?\nPhoenix:\nWait a minute! You went on the train dressed like that!?\nRon:\nN-No! I... I... I was just speaking hypothetically, that's all. A-Anyway... I'm sooooorry! I just lost it somewhere! I don't know where!\nPhoenix:\n... (This guy's story is more surreal than a Dali painting.)\nMaya:\nAre you really sure this creep is Mask☆DeMasque?\nPhoenix:\nMaya, don't call him a \"creep\". (Although I do have to admit, I understand your doubts about this guy...)\nDessie (appears after \"Mask☆DeMasque\")\nPhoenix:\nSo who is this Dessie person?\nRon:\n...! Pleeeease don't talk about my wife like that!\nMaya:\n...I-I guess she must be his wife...\nRon:\n*huff huff huff* I'm sorry! The truth is... It was my wife that told me to have you all come here... Um... Do you think you could go and visit her at my hideout?\nPhoenix:\nH... Hideout?\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! What does he mean by \"hideout\"...?\nRon:\nOh, sorry. Naturally, I meant to say my \"secret base\".\nPhoenix:\nS-Secret base?\nRon:\nWell, my apartment actually. Palazzo Pelpepe, 3rd floor...\nMaya:\nLet's go have a look, Nick! To Mask☆DeMasque's hideout!\nPhoenix:\n(Something tells me she just likes the sound of the word \"hideout\".)\nPresent\nTreasure Exhibit Poster or Sacred Urn\nRon:\nI'm really sorry I caused so much trouble.\nMaya:\nIf you're so sorry, then you shouldn't have stolen it in the first place!\nRon:\nB-But... The only thing I did wrong was lose it! ...Err, that's not right. I was wrong either way. I'm sure the owners of the other treasures fell the same\nMaya:\n...He sure seems sorry.\nPearl:\nWho would have imagined that such a famous thief would have such a pure heart...\nDeMasque's Calling Card\nRon:\nOh! That's Mask☆DeMasque's calling card! Pretty nice-looking, huh!?\nMaya:\nHe looks so happy...\nRon:\nI'm not very good at writing, you see... So I bought a book called \"How to Write Business Letters\" and studied hard!\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I guess you could call thievery a type of business...)\nMask☆DeMasque profile\nRon:\nEver since I was a little boy, I've always been interested in mysterious masked men!\nPhoenix:\nSo that's what you wanted to be when you grew up?\nRon:\nYes! ...Err, no. Sort of, but not exactly... I never imagined I'd feel as bad as I do now about the treasures being stolen...\nPhoenix:\n(...People sure can be complicated, can't they.)\nLuke Atmey profile\nRon:\nH-Him...!\nPhoenix:\nDo you know him? He claims to be your arch-enemy and rival.\nRon:\nTh-That person... He... He's not my arch-enemy OR my rival! ...Well, actually, no. Now that I think about it, the terms arch-enemy and rival are the same thing\nMaya:\nThey ARE rivals! Only people who have it out for each other would disagree like this!\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you think about this?\nRon:\nHmm... I don't really think I can help you with that. Err, no, that's not it... Well... The thing is... I don't really know if I can say one way or the other\nMaya:\nI didn't really catch that.\nPhoenix:\nDon't worry, you didn't miss anything.\nAfter clearing \"Dessie\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room:\nOctober 12\nMask☆DeMasque's Hideout\nPhoenix:\n... Wow, check this place out!\nMaya:\nNo doubt about it, this is Mask☆DeMasque's hideout alright.\n???:\nWho is it? Is that you, Ronnie? Huh? Who are you people?\nPhoenix:\nErr, umm... Are you \"Dessie\" DeLite? (Changed from [Err, umm... Are you Desirée DeLite?] in the original release)\nDesirée:\nThat's right. I'm Desirée. ... Ah! Oh! You must be the lawyer... and the victim!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, that's us. Your husband told us to stop by and speak with you. (Changed from [Y-Yeah, that's us. Your husband told us that you wanted us to stop by.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nI'm Maya Fey, and this is Phoenix Wright, attorney at law.\nDesirée:\n\"Nicky boy\" and Maya, huh? I can't tell you how grateful I am that you decided to help my Ronnie.\nMaya:\nWell, um... Aha ha... You're welcome.\nPhoenix:\n(Did she really call me \"Nicky boy\"?)\nExamine\nHot air balloon\nMaya:\nOh, that's so cute! It's called a hot air balloon, you know!\nPhoenix:\n...Wow! There's no fooling you!\nMaya:\nI want to make my own balloon now! I'll even let you ride in it, Nick!\nPhoenix:\n(That emblem on the balloon is supposed to be top-secret. That's proof enough that Ron DeLite really is Mask☆DeMasque. I'd better not tell Maya. She gets kinda... scary when it comes to \"celebrities\"...)\nPiled stuff on left\nPhoenix:\nThere's a whole bunch of stuff piled up over here.\nMaya:\nDuck and cover! It-It's a missile! Did you know there's d-dynamite in missiles!?\nPhoenix:\nBut they're not heavy enough to be real... Oh wait. They're just really well-made toys.\nMaya:\nWhat are these rolls of paper stuck in the trash can? \"Theft of the Mazarin Stone: The Great Albatross Strategy\" \"Theft of the Immortal Goddess Statue: The Great Knucklebomber Strategy\"\nPhoenix:\n... (Did the police even investigate this place...?)\nGreen envelope\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Look on top of the chair!\nPhoenix:\nLooks like an envelope... And a letter.\nMaya:\nWell, don't just stand there! Come on, let's read it!\nPhoenix:\nMaya, you know we shouldn't do that!\nMaya:\nWhat are you talking about? That letter could be an important clue!\nPhoenix:\nNo way. You can't just go reading a private letter because you feel like it.\nMaya:\n...Hmph! It's not just because I \"feel like it\". It really could be important!\nPhoenix:\n(If I was sure it was a clue, I guess I wouldn't mind...)\nMasks and beard\nPhoenix:\nIt's a bunch of cheap costume pieces arranged inside a nice frame.\nMaya:\nL-Look, Nick! It's a fake beard!\nPhoenix:\nThere's also a mask made out of cardboard...\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Try on this fake beard! Come on! Try it on!\nPhoenix:\nH-Hey! Cut it out...\nMaya:\nNow put on the mask! ... Aha ha ha ha ha ha! It's Phoenix☆DeMasque! Let's borrow it for a while.\nPhoenix:\n(No way! I'm not stealing from a thief! I have enough bad karma as is!)\nHelmet and transceiver\nPhoenix:\n(Hmmm... This thing looks vaguely familiar.)\nMaya:\nOh, I know! It's a fishbowl! Well, an upside-down one, anyway...\nPhoenix:\nI think it's a helmet. ...An alien helmet.\nMaya:\nAnd that looks like a tape recorder or something next to it.\nPhoenix:\nI think it's a transceiver. ...An alien transceiver.\nMaya:\nNick... Do you think maybe you could act like a grown-up for a little bit?\nPhoenix:\n(Getting lectured by Maya to be more of an adult. That's a new low...)\nMask☆DeMasque model\nMaya:\nIt's Mask☆DeMasque!\nPhoenix:\nThere's a tape recorder hanging from his neck.\nMaya:\nLet me see that!\n...click...\nDeMasque:\nAha ha ha ha ha ha ha... I'll be taking this crown now! Better luck next time, gentlemen! Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha...\nMaya:\n... I don't get it... What's this supposed to be, Nick?\nTorpedo\nMaya:\nNick! It-It's a torpedo!\nPhoenix:\n...It's hard to believe, but it sure looks real.\nMaya:\nWhere could he have picked up something like this?\nPhoenix:\nPlease don't say that torpedoes are things people just leave lying around.\nBooks\nPhoenix:\nThere are a bunch of books lying here. They're all romantic-sounding novels about famous heists and fantastic thieves.\nMaya:\nWow! Look at all the bookmarks and notes stuck into them!\nPhoenix:\nLet's see here... \"Note: Must remember this thief's way of laughing. Very useful.\" \"Note: A calling card is an important part of any good thief's modus operandi!\"\nMaya:\n...\nPhoenix:\nW-Wow, Ron really studied his stuff!\nTalk\nRon DeLite\nPhoenix:\nUmm, about your husband...\nDesirée:\nHee hee, isn't he cutest? A bit weak sometimes though...\nPhoenix:\n...\"A bit\"?\nDesirée:\nBy the way, did you know they mentioned Maya on TV?\nMaya:\nHuh? Really!?\nDesirée:\nThey said you own the urn and that you're doing some shady training at a law office now.\nPhoenix:\n(Remind me not to watch that channel's news program.)\nDesirée:\nAfter I saw that, I thought it might be a good idea to meet the lawyer they mentioned.\nPhoenix:\n...I see.\nDesirée:\nMy Ronnie... He has a powerful imagination and gets deluded easily. He kept insisting he was going to surrender to the police. I didn't know what to do! \"It was me! I stole that urn!\" he kept saying! As if it was even possible!\nMaya:\nHuh...? B-But... Are you saying he didn't?\nDesirée:\nHa ha ha. Of course he didn't! Why would my Ronnie ever do something like that?\nMaya:\nW-Well, you know... It's a p-priceless treasure! And-And he's... You know...\nPhoenix:\n(...Is it possible his own wife doesn't know his secret identity?)\nDesirée DeLite\nDesirée:\nMe? I'm the kind of woman that needs excitement in her life!\nMaya:\nOh... Excitement, huh?\nDesirée:\nYes. I'm at my happiest when I'm racing along with my bike going at full throttle. Riding a motorcycle is like putting your life on the line. You know what I mean?\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I think that depends on how you ride it...)\nDesirée:\nI'm the type that can't stand living a boring, dreary old life with no action.\nMaya:\nNo offense, but your husband, Ron, doesn't exactly look like the risk-taking type himself.\nDesirée:\nYou're right about that. He's definitely not one for thrills and danger. But I do have to say that he makes up for it in other ways.\nPhoenix:\nOther ways...?\nDesirée:\nYes, money... Ronnie is incredibly rich... And super generous. He bought me a bike that's so fast it would make your head spin. And shopping? I like to shop so much it makes Ron's head spin. The other day, it actually happened. His head actually started to spin.\nPhoenix:\n(Man, talk about a high maintenance wife...)\nMaya:\nSo where does Mr. DeLite get all this money from?\nDesirée:\nRonnie is a security guard. They put their lives on the line, right? So they get paid tons of money in return. Tons of it.\nPhoenix:\n(He's a security guard...? I think it's my turn for my head to spin...)\nThe night of the crime (appears after \"Desirée DeLite\")\nPhoenix:\nCan you tell us about what happened last night?\nDesirée:\nHmm, what time did that incident take place again?\nPhoenix:\nWhat time was it again, Maya?\nMaya:\nWell, according to Detective Gumshoe, it was around 1:30 in the morning.\nDesirée:\nAh, last night was horrible. I got pulled over!\nMaya:\nP-Pulled over?\nDesirée:\nYes... I always do my best flying at night!\nPhoenix:\n\"Flying\"...? Um, you're talking about your motorcycle, right?\nDesirée:\nYes. Anyway, last night I got pulled over. By a policeman. I can't believe he caught up to me! It was a great chase, let me tell you! When he finally caught me, the poor man was as white as a sheet. It was about three in the morning when I finally got home.\nPhoenix:\n(Sounds like she's got an airtight alibi...)\nMaya:\nWell, what about Mr. DeLite?\nDesirée:\nI don't really know... We weren't together at that time of the night. But when I got home, he was already fast asleep.\nPhoenix:\n(So basically he's got no alibi...)\nDelusions (appears after presenting Mask☆DeMasque profile)\nPhoenix:\nSo... When did Ron first become Mask☆DeMasque?\nDesirée:\nWhat are you talking about? He's not Mask☆DeMasque!\nPhoenix:\nHuh? But... W-Wait a second! Look around at this room! This place is obviously Mask☆DeMasque's hideout...\nDesirée:\nNo no, you're totally wrong. A real thief's hideout wouldn't look like this! It's because Ronnie is so timid himself that he looks up to heroic figures.\nMaya:\nHeroic figures? But Mask☆DeMasque is a bad guy.\nPhoenix:\n(So he's \"deluded\", huh... Could that really be true?)\nDesirée:\nAnyway, if he really had stolen the urn, wouldn't he still have it?\nPhoenix:\nW-Well, I suppose so...\nDesirée:\nThen why don't you ask him if he has the urn or not?\nPhoenix:\n(She has a point. Mr. DeLite isn't exactly the criminal type... But something about Ron's behavior bothers me.)\nMaya:\nMaybe it's true... Maybe Mr. DeLite isn't Mask☆DeMasque after all.\nPresent\nTreasure Exhibit Poster, Ami Fey's Golden Statue, Sacred Urn, or Shichishito\nDesirée:\nOoh! That's so mysterious looking... I love old stuff like this!\nMaya:\nReally!? That's one of our most treasured possessions! There's going to be a whole exhibit at Lordly Tailor with these types of things!\nPhoenix:\n(Maya looks so happy. She's lit up like a 1,000 watt bulb.)\nDesirée:\nTerrific! You can count on Ronnie and me to be there! Sounds like fun!\nMaya:\nHuh! ...Oh, err, yeah... Ha ha ha...\nPhoenix:\n(Oops, looks like that light bulb is starting to flicker.)\nDeMasque's Calling Card\nPhoenix:\nUmm, so what do you know about this...?\nMaya:\nNo! You can't show her that, Nick! That emblem is top-secret! Don't you remember!?\nPhoenix:\n...Doh! Oops, sorry about that. (But the way she just said \"top-secret\" was a worse giveaway than what I did...)\nDesirée:\nOoh! When I hear the word \"top-secret\", it just piques my interest like nothing else!\nPhoenix Wright profile\nDesirée:\nSo, Nicky boy, you're a lawyer, huh?\nPhoenix:\nWell, yeah.\nDesirée:\nHow do you like it? I bet it's SO exciting!\nPhoenix:\n...Yeah, sometimes. Actually, a little too exciting at times.\nDesirée:\nOooh! I just love a good thrill. Hmm... Nicky boy... It sounds like you have it so nice...\nPhoenix:\n(Um... This is starting to get awkward.)\nMaya Fey profile\nDesirée:\nThat's really amazing! A \"Master\" at your age!\nMaya:\nOh no, you've got it wrong. It's my mother that's the current Master!\nDesirée:\nOh, I see... So what exactly is she the master of anyway?\nMaya:\nWell, you see, it's li-\nPhoenix:\nDon't say it, Maya. If you say \"spirit channeling\", she'll laugh.\nMaya:\nOuch... That hurt.\nMask☆DeMasque profile\nPhoenix:\n...Um, Ms. DeLite. You must know, right? About your husband and Mask☆DeMasque...\nDesirée:\nMask☆DeMasque? Of course. I know all about it. My husband is his biggest fan.\nMaya:\nYup... Wha...? ...Huh?\nPhoenix:\nB-Biggest fan?\nDesirée:\nYes, and Ronnie can be pretty delusional sometimes. That's how this whole misunderstanding happened.\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait a minute! Did you say \"delusional\"!?\nDesirée:\nYes, that's right. I just don't know what I'm going to do with him... You see, Ronnie actually believes that HE is Mask☆DeMasque!\nMaya:\nWH-WHAAAAT!? What are you talking about!?\nRon DeLite profile\nDesirée:\nI know he doesn't look it... But he can really get things done when he puts his mind to it.\nMaya:\nReally? So when exactly does he put his mind to it?\nDesirée:\n...Well. Not very often, I admit.\nPhoenix:\n(What exactly does Ms. DeLite see in her husband anyway?)\nMaya:\nWow, you must've really seen skyrockets when you first met to love him so much!\nPhoenix:\nSkyrockets...? I didn't know people still used that word.\nDesirée DeLite profile\nDesirée:\nAs long as I've got my motorcycle and my Ronnie, I'm happy.\nMaya:\nOh! That's so sweet!\nDesirée:\nOh, that plus a little excitement and a little shopping money! ...THEN I'm happy.\nMaya:\nNow she's starting to sound a bit greedy... Don't you think, Nick?\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nExcuse me, but would you take a look at this...?\nDesirée:\nOh, I'm sorry... I haven't the faintest idea. I guess I just don't get out enough.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nDesirée:\nSay... Can I ask you something, Nicky boy?\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it?\nDesirée:\nI know I may seem like a \"bad girl\" on the outside... But the one thing I won't stand for is illegal activity.\nMaya:\nI had the feeling you wouldn't! You're tough... But I can tell you've got a good heart. (Changed from [I had the feeling you didn't! You're tough... But I can tell you've got a good heart.] in the original release)\nDesirée:\nSomebody framed my poor Ronnie, I just know it. Umm... Could you give this to Ronnie for me?\nMaya:\nA letter?\nDesirée:\nYes, for Ronnie. I want him to fight back.\nMaya:\nMs. DeLite... OK, you've got it! Just relax and leave it all to us!\nDesirée's Letter added to the Court Record.\nPresent\nDesirée's Letter\nDesirée:\nCould you please give that to my Ronnie? The contents are very important.\nPhoenix:\n(*sigh* Back to the detention center I go...)\nDetention Center\nPresent\nDesirée DeLite profile\nRon:\nThat's my lovely wife! Isn't she beautiful?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, she sure is...\nPearl:\n... *glare*\nPhoenix:\n(Whoo boy. The one topic I didn't want to get into in front of Pearls...)\nRon:\nBut... Dessie doesn't approve of my... \"interests\". So I'm afraid she doesn't like me anymore... What should I do? If I want to win her back, I'm really going to have to be super honest.\nPhoenix:\n(Oh boy. he's gone back into his own little world again...)\nDesirée's Letter\nPhoenix:\n...Oh, that's right! Here. This is from your wife.\nRon:\nOh? From Dessie!? Thank you!\nLetter given to Mask☆DeMasque. ... Actually, more like \"taken\".\nRon:\n\"My dear Ronnie, how are you? I'm doing fine...\" ...\nPhoenix:\n(He's clutching onto that letter so hard, the ink is going to be squeezed out...)\nMaya:\nHe looks so happy...\nPearl:\nYou should write a letter to Mystic Maya too, Mr. Nick!\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Desirée's Letter:\nRon:\n... Umm... Mr. Lawyer?\nPhoenix:\nYes?\nRon:\nIn the letter that Dessie wrote, she said... \"Ask this guy to be your lawyer!\"\nMaya:\nHuh...?\nRon:\nErr, umm... I know this would be asking a lot, but... Could you please take my case? My trial starts tomorrow...\nMaya:\nHey, hang on a second! He can't be your lawyer!\nPhoenix:\nWhy not?\nMaya:\nWhat do you mean, \"why not\"!? We're the victims in this case, right!? Victims of this DeMasque guy!\nPhoenix:\nWell, yeah... But according to Desirée, he didn't do it...\nPearl:\nShe said, \"Poor man, he's deluded himself into thinking he did it.\" Right, Mr. Nick?\nMaya:\nCome on! She could be lying to protect her husband!\nPhoenix:\nW-Well, that's true. ...Err, no actually not. Actually it's hard to say (...Oh no, it's spreading!)\nRon:\nOh, please! I'll give you the treasure of your choice in return...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... What should I do?)\nTake his case\nPhoenix:\n...Well, Mr. DeLite, I've decided to give it a try. I'll defend you.\nRon:\nReally? You will?\nMaya:\nHey! What're you doing, Nick!?\nPearl:\nHe... He's a thief! You can't trust him!\nPhoenix:\nWell, he may be a thief... But I think there's more to this case than meets the eye.\nLeads to:\n\"M-Mr. Nick...! I-I was wrong about you... I shouldn't have trusted you!\"\nRefuse his case\nMaya:\nDon't do it, Nick! He's a thief!\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! I agree with Mystic Maya!\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I admit something about this guy stinks like last week's sushi. I guess I really should say no. But... If I do that, this poor guy will have nobody on his side!) ...Well, Mr. DeLite, I've decided to take your case.\nRon:\nReally? You will?\nLeads to:\n\"M-Mr. Nick...! I-I was wrong about you... I shouldn't have trusted you!\"\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick...! I-I was wrong about you... I shouldn't have trusted you!\nPhoenix:\nP-Pearls...?\nPearl:\nI can't believe you'd defend this person after what he did to Mystic Maya...! I-I... I'll never forgive you... EVER! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!\nMaya:\nP-! Pearly...! Wait!\nPhoenix:\n(This is going to be ugly...)\nMaya:\nI-I'll go after her!\nRon:\nUmm... Sorry about that. I didn't mean to cause any trouble...\nPhoenix:\nWell... You couldn't have known she'd react like that. (I guess I might as well start investigating...) Oh, Maya... Where's Pearls?\nMaya:\nShe said she's going back to the office. Go check in on her later, would you?\nPhoenix:\nAnd what about you...? Are you OK with me taking Mr. DeLite's case...?\nMaya:\nY-Yeah... I'm fine, Nick. I believe in you.\nPhoenix:\n... *sniffle* (I think I'm going to cry.)\nRon:\nUmm... I, err... I know you have a lot of work to do... I... I really appreciate it.\nMaya:\nOK, Nick! Let's get this show on the road!\nExamine\nSecurity camera\nPhoenix:\nSmile, you're on candid camera. The camera doesn't seem to have a lot to tape right now. The only thing it's watching now is that guard over there.\nSecurity guard\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room. It looks like he doesn't have much to do right now. I can tell because he's looking at the camera and making funny faces.\nOctober 12Wright & Co. Law Offices\nPearl:\nAh... Mr. Nick! W-Welcome back!\nPhoenix:\nOh, hey Pearls. You're back too, I see.\nPearl:\nI, um... I went and bought us a strawberry cake! I'll go make some tea to go with it!\nPhoenix:\nHey, uh Pearls... ...\nMaya:\nIt looks like she feels really bad about what happened at the detention center...\nPearl:\nM-Mr. Nick...! I-I was wrong about you... I shouldn't have trusted you!\nPearl:\nI-I... I'll never forgive you... EVER!\nPearl:\nMystic Maya! The tea is ready!\nMaya:\nOh... Thanks...\nPearl:\nCome on, Mr. Nick! Please have some of this cake!\nPhoenix:\nYeah... Thanks. Umm, Pearls?\nPearl:\nOh! Ex-Excuse me... I was in the middle of cleaning the toilet...!\nPhoenix:\nHey, it's OK! I just cleaned it this morning...\nMaya:\nToo late...\nPhoenix:\n(...This might be a good time for me to ask about her.)\nExamine\nCharley the plant\nPhoenix:\nCharley. A quite decorative plant. When she was alive, Mia really loved it. She even went so far as to make it our mascot. No matter how busy I get, I never forget to water this little fella.\nDesk\nPhoenix:\nIt's my desk. I don't get to use it much, so the dust bunnies are starting to mount their assault. Hm? Today it's sparkly clean. I guess Pearls must've wiped them out for me.\nBookshelf\nPhoenix:\nDifficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. These were all Mia's... Wow, I just realized I didn't buy a single one of these.\nTalk\nPearl\nPhoenix:\n(I first met Pearls a year ago... It was when that murder happened at Kurain Village. I still remember what she said to me when we first met...)\nPearl:\nYou... You're Mr. Nick, right? You're... You're Mystic Maya's... \"special someone\"...\nPhoenix:\n...Hey, Maya. I've always thought it was because she was young, but...\nMaya:\nBut what...?\nPhoenix:\nPearls... I think she's got the wrong idea. About... you and me. (Changed from [About... you and I.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nHuh!? Err, I... ...Umm...There's something you need to understand...\nPhoenix:\nWh-What is it?\nMaya:\nUmm... It's kind of like a Kurain Village custom... Sort of.\nMaya\nPhoenix:\nPearls seems to love you a lot.\nMaya:\nWell, it's because I'm her only cousin. And... well... Because of the murder case last year, Pearly's mother is...\nPhoenix:\nOh yeah...\nPhoenix:\n(I remember now... Pearls's mother, Morgan Fey... She's serving a prison term in isolation right now...)\nMaya:\nSo you see? I'm the only family Pearly has right now... But... It's the same for me, too.\nPhoenix:\nMaya...\nMaya:\nMy mother's gone, too...\nKurain Village Custom (appears after \"Pearl\")\nMaya:\nThere are hardly any men in Kurain Village.\nPhoenix:\nNow that you mention it, I never actually saw any men there when I visited.\nMaya:\nI'm pretty sure I told you about it a long time ago... About how spiritual powers run very strong in the Fey family.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, you did. And that's why you're undergoing training to be a spirit medium, right?\nMaya:\nYeah... The thing is, only women can actually inherit the spiritual power. That's why the whole culture of Kurain Village kinda revolves around its women.\nPhoenix:\nWell, that's understandable... Nothing wrong with that.\nMaya:\nYeah, but because of that... There tends to be a lot of unsuccessful marriages.\nPhoenix:\nOh?\nMaya:\nWell, men start to feel left out after a while, and then they just start leaving. ...Especially if the man has a daughter.\nPhoenix:\nAre you saying that Pearls's father...?\nMaya:\n...He's gone. He left the village when she was very young.\nPhoenix:\nBoy, that's tough...\nMaya:\nYeah, and she grew up seeing nothing but unhappy marriages all around her. That's why she's so sensitive to things like that.\nMaya's mother (appears after \"Maya\")\nPhoenix:\nSo your mother's still missing...?\nMaya:\nYeah... And no one has any idea where she is.\nPhoenix:\n(Maya's mother... Misty Fey. The current Master of the Kurain Channeling Technique. She disappeared 17 years ago after getting involved in a certain police case.)\nPhoenix:\n...But you're sure she's still alive, right?\nMaya:\nYeah... I know she is... It's sort of a spirit medium thing...\nPhoenix:\nAnd if your mother doesn't come back, then what...?\nMaya:\nThen according to the laws of the village, I'll become the next Master.\nPhoenix:\nMystic Maya... The Master of the Kurain Technique... Sounds like a heavy responsibility.\nMaya:\nYeah, but there's no one else with the blood of the Fey main family who's a spirit medium.\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nMaya:\nSo you've still got that badge, I see.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Well, I'm a lawyer, aren't I?\nMaya:\nYeah, but I guess I just didn't think you'd keep on being one for this long. You have to admit, you've had some close brushes with death because of your job.\nPhoenix:\n(...I fail to see how being a lawyer is more dangerous than channeling dead people.)\nTreasure Exhibit Poster or Sacred Urn\nMaya:\nYou know, I thought we'd finally found the urn.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, if only Ron DeLite were Mask☆DeMasque, we'd have figured it all out.\nMaya:\nHuh? You mean he's NOT Mask☆DeMasque?\nPhoenix:\nWell, Desirée says he isn't and I believe her.\nMaya:\nHmm... The mystery gets deeper and deeper.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, and the trial starts tomorrow... as usual.\nDeMasque's Calling Card\nPhoenix:\nSo this was made by the real Mask☆DeMasque, huh?\nMaya:\nYup, Detective Gumshoe said it was the real thing. \"One look at this mark and you know it's the real deal, pal.\"\nPhoenix:\nYeah, but you do realize whose deductive reasoning skills we're talking about, right...?\nShichishito\nMaya:\nThis sword... It has a strange aura surrounding it. It's like it's infused with a spirit of both anger and tragedy.\nPhoenix:\nWell, I'd be mad too if somebody bent me the way they bent this sword.\nMaya:\n...Yeah, I guess that could be it.\nPhoenix Wright profile\nMaya:\nWhen did you first get that porcupine cut?\nPhoenix:\n...Um, it's been like this ever since I was a little kid.\nMaya:\nWhat!? You mean that's the way your hair is naturally? I thought you had some sort of special \"Phoenix Cut\" deal with the barber. I mean... You usually only see hair like that in a video game.\nMia Fey profile\nPhoenix:\nIf it wasn't for Mia, I wouldn't be the person I am today.\nMaya:\nYeah, she told me you used to really be useless. Compared to how unreliable you were then, you actually seem responsible now. ...Actually, you haven't changed that much, I guess.\nPhoenix:\n(Maya praised me for a change! ...Hey, wait a second...)\nPearl Fey profile\nMaya:\nI'm so sorry that Pearly said what she did.\nPhoenix:\nOh, It's fine... It-It was nothing... (I'm going to have to smooth things over with Pearls later somehow...)\nDick Gumshoe profile\nMaya:\nDetective Gumshoe's on this case too, huh.\nPhoenix:\nHe seems to show up during all of our cases. It can't be a coincidence.\nMaya:\nMaybe it's a sign that our fates are destined to be woven together for all time!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, that'd be a real Beauty and the Beast kind of fairy tale, wouldn't it.\nMask☆DeMasque or Ron DeLite profile\nMaya:\nSo the real identity of Mask☆DeMasque is... ...Ron DeLite, right?\nPhoenix:\nThat's what Mr. DeLite claims. ...But I'm not too convinced about something he said.\nMaya:\nHuh? About what?\nPhoenix:\nAbout the Sacred Urn. Didn't he sound a little vague on the subject?\nMaya:\nYeah, now that you mention it, he said that he simply \"lost it\", right?\nPhoenix:\n(I have this distinct feeling that he's hiding something. I just know it...)\nLuke Atmey profile\nMaya:\nThat Detective Atmey guy really surprised me. There was this certain something about the way he said, \"Zvarri!\"\nPhoenix:\nWell he did manage to get back the treasure that the Mask guy stole last time, right? And he did it by himself, too.\nMaya:\nYeah, I guess. ...That case has certainly made him famous.\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like he does deserve to be called \"Ace Detective\" after all.\nDesirée DeLite profile\nMaya:\nThat Desirée sure is cool! I love that whole motorcycle thing! The way she laughs in the face of death... I want to try it myself!\nPhoenix:\nI thought you only knew how to ride a bike...\nMaya:\nHey! Don't forget, Nick, that it's an electric bike!\nPhoenix:\n...E-Electric? So young and already so lazy. Whatever happened to good old exercise?\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you think about this?\nMaya:\nHmmm... It seems like it has something to do with this case... But I'm not really sure...\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nMaya:\nWell, Nick! Why don't we go out and start investigating? We're not going to learn anything just sitting around the office!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I know... But... First I want to talk to Pearls...\nPearl:\n...Umm, Mr. Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah...?\nPearl:\nI... I acted like a baby.\nPhoenix:\nPearls...\nPearl:\nI doubted you... Even though Mystic Maya trusted you completely... I guess I still have a lot of training to do. Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes?\nPearl:\nI... From the bottom of my heart, I apologize for what I said!\nPhoenix:\nAww, it's OK! I'm the one that should be apologizing!\nPearl:\nWell, I'm going out now for a little bit.\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? Wh-Where are you going...?\nPearl:\nI may be small, but I still have a lot of spirit channeling power! So I'm going to show you I can be useful too... By finding some evidence!\nPhoenix:\nHey! W-Wait a...! (Ack! She sure runs fast...)\nMaya:\nNick... Let's back off and give her some room, OK?\nPhoenix:\n...Yeah.\nOctober 12Lordly TailorMain Exhibition Hall\nAndrews:\nM-Maya...!\nMaya:\nOh, Ms. Andrews...\nAndrews:\nI'm so sorry! It's my fault! ...Your precious urn! Your... precious... UUUUURNNN!!!\nPhoenix:\nPlease! C-Calm down! What's wrong?\nAndrews:\n*sniffle* It never ends! Everything I touch ends in failure! Maya, I'm sorry...! I'll do anything to make it up to you!\nMaya:\nN-No, it's okay, don--\nAndrews:\nI know I don't look it, but I'm good with my hands. I could make you another urn.\nMaya:\nHold on, just wait, OK? Breathe, calm down and talk to us.\nAndrews:\nF-Forgive me! Forgive me!\nExamine\nCushion\nPhoenix:\nThat's probably where the Sacred Urn was going to be displayed.\nMaya:\nYeah, I guess so...\nPhoenix:\nShould I put my attorney's badge there? You know, as a replacement?\nMaya:\nHmm... I think it's a little too small for that. What about my Magatama?\nPhoenix:\nNow you're being silly... That's definitely too small.\nFolding screen\nMaya:\nIt's the folding screen of Kurain Sacred Writings. But I can't read what it says on it.\nPhoenix:\nReally? But I thought it was some kind of important spell!\nMaya:\nAhh, yeah. My mother read it and taught me to memorize it. I'll be in trouble if I ever forget it.\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like the Kurain Channeling School is teetering dangerously on the edge...)\nKurain Village diorama\nMaya:\nWow, this is incredible! It's a tiny version of my Kurain Village! Hey! I've got a great idea! We can make a miniature of your office, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nI don't know about that. The whole place is overflowing with junk. You'd die before you finish painstakingly recreating that mess.\nMaya:\nWell, we could always clean it up first.\nPhoenix:\n*shrug* True.\nTalk\nDeMasque's calling card\nPhoenix:\nUmm... So when did you get the calling card from Mask☆DeMasque?\nAndrews:\nLet's see... Exactly 10 days ago. I was going to show it to the police... But that detective stopped me.\nMaya:\nUm, so you asked Detective Atmey to help with security?\nAndrews:\nYes. In fact, it was about 20 days ago that I hired him. He seemed to know much more about Mask☆DeMasque than the police.\nPhoenix:\nSo you hired him for security even before the calling card arrived?\nAndrews:\nWell, yes. I had a premonition that something bad might happen... I've learned to trust my hunches!\nPhoenix:\nSo that's why there are security cameras, even in the basement warehouse?\nAndrews:\nYes. Lordly Tailor is very serious about their security measures. It was their way of saying, \"Bring it on!\" to any potential thieves...\nPhoenix:\n(Well, he sure \"brought it\" last night... And even left with a nice souvenir.)\nThe security\nMaya:\nUm, can you tell us a bit about the security for the Treasure Exhibit?\nAndrews:\nIt was all my fault! I never should have called this paltry little collection a \"treasure exhibit\" anyway...\nPhoenix:\nWhy do you say that? The urn that was stolen is a pretty important object...\nAndrews:\nMaybe, but it's actual value after appraisal was... well, practically zero.\nMaya:\nZero!?\nAndrews:\nI polished it until it was just about glowing... I thought maybe I could make it look more valuable!\nMaya:\nB-But that urn contains the soul of Mystic Ami...\nAndrews:\nAnyway, I left all the security arrangements to Detective Atmey. But... Five days ago, I began receiving all sorts of other exhibit items from Kurain. Lots of people started going in and out of the warehouse down there.\nMaya:\nSo maybe one of them was actually Mask☆DeMasque in disguise...!\nAndrews:\nNo, I personally checked out everyone that came through here, so that's not possible.\nPhoenix:\n(Knowing Adrian, she probably even checked out what they ate for breakfast that morning.)\nPresent\nAnything\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Ms. Andrews?\nAndrews:\nI know, I know! It's all my fault! But what's done is done... I'll make it up by making a new urn for you...\nPhoenix:\n(I'm just wasting my time. She's too far gone...)\nBasement Warehouse\nExamine\nSecurity camera\nPhoenix:\nI wonder if that detective brought this camera in with him?\nMaya:\nGood question! Let's take a look at it. ...Huh? It says \"Property of Lordly Tailor\" on it.\nPhoenix:\nSo it's borrowed...?\nMaya:\nKind of strange for an \"Ace Detective\", don't you think?\nComputer\nPhoenix:\nAccording to the computer data... ...someone did in fact go through those big doors last night, right?\nMaya:\nYeah, I guess so. The shutter did go off once, you know.\nWooden box\nPhoenix:\nThat pathetic-looking wooden box...\nMaya:\nAhh!! That's the box that had the Sacred Urn on it!\nPhoenix:\nDon't touch it! There may be clues to the thief's identity on there!\nMaya:\nGrr... I worked so hard to make that box!\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? You MADE that poor excuse for a box, Maya?\nMaya:\nWhat's that supposed to mean!? And I-I was so proud of it... *sniffle sniffle*\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Maya. Maybe it'd have been better if Mask☆DeMasque had taken the box, too...)\nShichishito\nMaya:\nI'm really starting to like this thing. It's so cool-looking. I'd like to strap it to my waist and walk around town like a samurai.\nPhoenix:\nCareful. Gumshoe will lock you up and throw away the key if you're caught.\nDoor to the storeroom\nMaya:\nOur precious urn was right there on the other side of these doors.\nPhoenix:\nYeah. and according to the security computer data...\nMaya:\nSomeone was in there last night. Grrr... What I'd like to do to him...!\nSpilled paint\nPhoenix:\nIt looks to me like it's been dry for several days.\nMaya:\nThere's something suspicious about this paint mark. The bottom left part of it is shaped oddly and it's shocking pink.\nPhoenix:\n...I don't see how the color of the paint is in any way important.\nAmi Fey statue\nPhoenix:\nWhen we were here with Ms. Andrews last night, the statue wasn't there it is now.\nMaya:\nYeah, it was right next to the door, wasn't it?\nPhoenix:\nWell, if someone moved it, it was probably the criminal.\nMaya:\nMaybe he didn't like being watched by Mystic Ami while he stole the urn.\nPhoenix:\n...Hey! Cut it out! You're giving me the creeps with that kind of talk!\nAfter clearing all Talk options in Wright & Co. Law Offices and clearing \"The security\" Talk option in Lordly Tailor - Main Exhibition Hall:\nOctober 12Atmey Detective Agency\nMaya:\nHello?\n...Well, well. How lovely it is to see you again, my dear.\nAtmey:\nWelcome to my abode! Relax! and soak up the atmosphere...\nPhoenix:\nErr, umm... We're actually kind of...\nAtmey:\nSHHH! SILENCE! ... Hee hee hee hee hee... Precisely as I expected.\nMaya:\nWh-What is?\nAtmey:\n...Zvarri! The truth has once again been elegantly revealed to me! A lawyer, and... a spirit medium. ...Am I correct?\nMaya:\n...Umm. I think we've already been through this.\nAtmey:\nHa! So my estimation was correct! Zvarri! ...How truly elegant. Now then, what can I do for you?\nExamine\nGramophone\nMaya:\nAaah! So the music in this room is coming from here!\nAtmey:\n\"Luke Atmey Elegy\" composed by Luke Atmey. This lovely device is called a \"gramophone\". In days of yore, people listened to music on them.\nMaya:\nAha! That's just what I thought! I told you so, Nick!\nPhoenix:\n...\nLuke Atmey painting\nMaya:\nThat's quite a large portrait of yourself you have there...\nAtmey:\nYes. I wanted it to say to everyone who saw it, \"Look at me, Luke Atmey!\" With a model so fine, I knew the portrait would also be aesthetically pleasing!\nMaya:\n...Um, that's nice.\nFireplace\nMaya:\nAaah! There's a cold breeze coming from this hearth!\nAtmey:\nHee hee hee hee... It seems you've fallen for my little deception. You see, this fireplace conceals a rather unexpected device. ...Yes! A high-tech air conditioner!\nMaya:\nWh-Why would you put an air conditioner in there?\nAtmey:\nIn the summer it acts as an air conditioner and in the winter, it's a heater. Clever?\nTalk\nThe night of the crime\nPhoenix:\nYou mentioned before that you were on guard all alone last night.\nAtmey:\nPrecisely. This is my fifth encounter with my arch-enemy. I refuse to allow anyone to interfere with the rightful pursuit of my prey.\nMaya:\nI heard you've been after Mask☆DeMasque since his very first theft?\nAtmey:\nYes, my dear. I see you've done your homework. In his very first heist, that vile thief pilfered the famous jewel, the \"Tear of Emanon\"! I first encountered him in the museum's sacred hall. The crime scene itself!\nMaya:\nSo... that's why you were hired as security for the Treasure Exhibit?\nPhoenix:\n(I'm pretty sure he said that Adrian Andrews hired him...)\nAtmey:\nYes, I borrowed some equipment from Lordly Tailor and set the perfect trap.\nPhoenix:\nYou must mean the security camera...\nMaya:\nBut I thought you were watching the area yourself, too. So how did Mask☆DeMasque manage to steal the urn?\nPhoenix:\nThat's the million dollar question... What is DeMasque's modus operandi?\nSacred Urn\nMaya:\nUmm... Mr. Atmey? Did you know about the Sacred Urn?\nAtmey:\nI'm interested in only one thing my dear, and that is Mask☆DeMasque! Sacred Urn...? Pfft! That has nothing to do with this case.\nPhoenix:\nBut... wasn't that what Mask☆DeMasque stole this time?\nAtmey:\nI am a hunter, sir! That urn was nothing more than a lure to catch my prey. Do you yourselves remember the shape of the individual peanuts you throw to pigeons?\nMaya:\n...I don't think I like this guy's attitude, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWell anyway, it looks like he doesn't know about the urn.\nDeMasque's M.O. (appears after \"The night of the crime\")\nMaya:\nUmm... There's something that's kind of bothering me.\nAtmey:\nPlease, my dear, ask me anything you like. After all, we are all but seekers, wandering alone in the dark.\nMaya:\nWell, I was wondering how Mask☆DeMasque managed to steal the urn. I mean, isn't it strange that you don't seem to know?\nAtmey:\n...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, now that you mention it, it is strange. After all, you were on guard that night at the scene of the crime. Unless you were sound asleep, you should have at least seen Mask☆DeMasque.\nAtmey:\n...\n1 PSYCHE-LOCK\nPhoenix:\nWh-What the!? It's a Psyche-Lock...\nMaya:\nPs-Psyche Lock...?\nDeMasque's M.O. (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nMr. Atmey... You must know more than you're letting on. How did Mask☆DeMasque manage to steal the Sacred Urn...?\n1 PSYCHE-LOCK\nAtmey:\nIn order for a secret to remain a secret, it must be kept secret.\nPhoenix:\n(Last night Luke Atmey must have encountered Mask☆DeMasque... But why would he be trying to hide it...?)\nMaya:\nNick! Go for it! Let's break that Psyche-Lock of his!\nPhoenix:\n(...I don't really think she understands what she's talking about. Well, it's been a while, but let's give this a shot...)\nPsyche-Lock (appears after \"DeMasque's M.O.\", before breaking Psyche-Lock)\nMaya:\nHey, Nick, what is this Psyche-Lock thing?\nPhoenix:\nWell, your magatama lets me see when people are keeping secrets. By breaking their mental \"locks\", I can find out what those secrets are.\nMaya:\nWhaaaaat!? This Magatama has THAT kind of power!?\nPhoenix:\n... Maya, you're the one who gave me this Magatama last year...\nMaya:\n...Well, it's true that this Magatama is a prized Fey family heirloom, but... Pearly was the one that actually imbued it with spiritual powers, right? That's why I don't really know much about what it can do.\nPhoenix:\n(This is the woman that's going to take over the Kurain Channeling School someday!?)\nMaya:\nSo how do you do it? How do you break the Psyche-Lock thing?\nPhoenix:\n...Well, you present the Magatama to the person with the secret.\nMaya:\n...Cool! I can't wait to see it in action! Come on! Try it out!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh boy... I think the future Master still needs to learn how to be patient...)\nDeMasque's M.O. (after breaking Psyche-Lock)\nAtmey:\nI can't deny that there may be a small hint of \"truth\" in what you say.\nMaya:\nSo, you were knocked out when the thief first clobbered you?\nAtmey:\nClobber... What an ugly way of saying it. But I suppose you could put it that way. The coward struck at the precise moment that I turned to look at the computer.\nMaya:\nSo you never noticed that the thief had entered the warehouse?\nAtmey:\nNo, the coward must have wormed his way in through somewhere besides the door... Perhaps the air ducts or the sewer pipes... Then my arch-nemesis struck me on the head from behind with this gruesome item here!\nMaya:\nOuch. Mr. Atmey should have his poor head examined. (Changed from [Ouch. He should have his poor head examined.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nYou can say that again.

O.  --\nPhoenix:\nDetective Atmey, you were standing guard at the scene of the crime... There's no way you didn't see Mask☆DeMasque commit the crime.\nAtmey:\nWell now, I can hardly see why you're so positive about that. Yes, indeed I was guarding the warehouse. That much is true. But I can tell you for certain that not a single person passed through that door.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not sure why... But this Atmey guy is lying through his teeth. ...I know. I'll show him some proof!) Detective Atmey, I have here proof that someone went through that door last night!\nPresent Camera Data\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"There was a security camera set up at the scene of the crime.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nAtmey:\nHow very interesting that you would present such a thing to me, Luke Atmey, Ace Detective. Unfortunately... It is meaningless. You need to go home, take a long, cold shower and get a good night's rest, Sir Lawyer.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess that's a miss...)\nAtmey:\nWell then...? Is there something else I can do for you?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Maybe I don't have enough evidence yet. If that's true, it could be dangerous for me to push on. But I need to break him!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Detective Atmey, I have here proof that someone went through that door last night!\"\nPhoenix:\nThere was a security camera set up at the scene of the crime. It should have automatically taken a photo of anyone that went through that door.\nAtmey:\n...Precisely.\nPhoenix:\nI hope you don't mind, but we've already gotten our hands on the camera data. As you can see, the camera went off exactly once last night.\nAtmey:\nWha...! B-But my monocle didn't catch anyone in its flash! It must be some kind of computer malfunction... It-It must be...!\nPhoenix:\nMaybe it was your monocle that malfunctioned.\nAtmey:\nWh-What!? Are you saying that I didn't do my duty properly?\nPhoenix:\nDetective Atmey. You must have seen the thief last night. The question is why are you trying to hide it! (If he's hiding it, there must be some reason! Some reason that he desperately wants to keep hidden... And I've got just the piece of evidence that should prove it!) OK, let's suppose you didn't manage to see Mask☆DeMasque.

This is the classic face of a thief. It is unmistakable!\nMaya:\nIs there anything that isn't \"unmistakable\" to you...\nAny other profile\nPhoenix:\nWhat about this person here, Detective Atmey?\nAtmey:\n...\nMaya:\nIs something wrong? Did the cat get your tongue or something?\nAtmey:\nThat photo leaves me with a distinctly indistinct feeling.\nPhoenix:\nUmmm...\nAtmey:\nIn this case, I'm afraid my perspicacity has been left wanting.\nPhoenix:\n(I think he's trying to say that he doesn't have any information...)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\nWell it looks like we got one thing cleared up anyway.\nMaya:\nHuh? What? That Atmey is the greatest Ace Detective in the world?\nPhoenix:\nNo, that he never actually saw the thief.\nMaya:\nOh... that's right! So the thief may not even be Mask☆DeMasque...\nAtmey:\nJust one moment, Sir Lawyer! The thief was unquestionably Mask☆DeMasque!\nMaya:\nBut you never actually saw him!\nAtmey:\nPerhaps so, but I installed a security camera for just such a contingency.\nMaya:\nOh...\nAtmey:\nLast night, the camera went off exactly once. Behold! This is a photo of the dastardly thief, taken by the security camera!\nPhoenix:\n...Th-That's him!\nMaya:\nM-Mask☆DeMasque...!\nSecurity Camera Photo added to the Court Record.\nAtmey:\nThe thief can be none other than the arch-criminal, Mask☆DeMasque. After all, he has a very good reason for committing such brazen crimes.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What are you talking about?\nTalk\nDeMasque's reason\nPhoenix:\nSo... What did you mean by he had a \"very good reason\"?\nAtmey:\nExactly that. Mr. DeLite had a very good reason to dress up and commit those crimes. There should be a green envelope somewhere in his room. ...You'll need to go and investigate.\nMaya:\nB-But how would you know about that...?\nAtmey:\nHmph. Have you forgotten? You're speaking to the finest Ace Detective ever to walk on the face of the earth! The most brilliant mind since ...well, EVER! Luke Atmey!\nPhoenix:\n(*sigh* Well, I guess we'd better go take a look, just in case...)\nDeMasque's Hideout (after clearing \"DeMasque's reason\" Talk option in Atmey Detective Agency)\nExamine\nGreen envelope\nLeads to:\n\"Hey! Nick! Remember what Detective Atmey said!?\"\nMaya:\nHey! Nick! Remember what Detective Atmey said!?\nAtmey:\nExactly that. Mr. DeLite had a very good reason to dress up and commit those crimes. There should be a green envelope somewhere in his room. ...You'll need to go and investigate.\nPhoenix:\nA green envelope, huh... Looks like this is it.\nMaya:\nOK! Let's have a look! \"If you don't want your true identity revealed to the world... ...come to KB Security at 1:00 AM on October 12th and bring $50,000.\" F-F-F-Fifty thousand...!\nPhoenix:\nTh-Th... This is a... B-B-Blackmail letter... (It sure looks like a major clue alright!)\nBlackmail Letter added to the Court Record.\n...*ding-dong*...\nDesirée:\nOh! Someone's at the door! I'll be right back. Won't take but a second, I promise. (Oh, thank you for coming! That's so nice of you!)\n???:\n(When I see a damsel in distress, I just can't help myself!)\nDesirée:\n(Please, come on in! I'll make some coffee.)\n???:\n(Really? OK, I guess I'll make myself at home, pretty lady!)\nPhoenix:\n(...Wait a minute. I know that voice...)\nDesirée:\nOh, Nicky boy, I'm so sorry, but I've got another guest!\n???:\nAaaaaaaaaaaah!! You... You're... Nick, it's you! And Maya, too! What a fluke!\nMaya:\nAh...! Larry! Long time no see!\nDesirée:\nWhat? You know each other?\nButz:\nNi... \"Nicky boy\"!? Nick, do you and this girl have... you know... something going on?\nPhoenix:\n\"S-Something\"? If you mean what I thin--\nButz:\nI underestimated you, Nick! A gorgeous lady like this? ...And married, too? Way to go, dude!\nPhoenix:\n(I knew it. Just when things can't get any worse, it's time to cue in the Butz.) Larry Butz... Ever since grade school, he's been... Not exactly a close friend, but yeah, we know each other.\nButz:\nHey, man, that wasn't nice! I was your very first client!\nPhoenix:\nWe've got quite the... storied history, he and I. (Changed from [It's been 25 years since I first met Larry.] in the original release) And what we used to say still rings true. When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\nButz:\nHey, come on now! You're embarrassing me! And in front of this pretty little thing here...\nDesirée:\nSo you two are old childhood friends, I see. That's so sweet! You two go ahead and catch up on old times. I'm going to go check on my bike.\nButz:\nNice girl, that Dessie... So how have ya been, Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Too busy if you really want to know...)\nExamine\nGreen envelope\nPhoenix:\nSo Ron received a blackmail letter, huh?\nMaya:\nDo you think Ms. DeLite knows about this?\nPhoenix:\nWell if she did, I don't think she would've been smiling like that.\nMaya:\nI wonder if we should tell her about it...\nPhoenix:\nI think it'd be smarter if we didn't.\nTalk\nLarry Butz\nPhoenix:\nSo what have you been up to this whole time? It's been two years since I heard from you. And what's with these clothes? You look... well, weird.\nButz:\nHey man, that's uncalled for. This is my uniform, from a my part-time job! But I can't believe it's been two years. They say time flies when you're having fun. Ha ha ha ha... Ah ha... Ha... ...ha?\nPhoenix:\nWh-What's wrong?\nButz:\nNick... I gotta tell you. Women. ...I don't trust'em anymore.\nPhoenix:\nYou got dumped again?\nButz:\nWell, you know Bennifer? I followed her all the way to Tibet 2 years ago. That's where I met the famous Katty Tom, and my whole life changed.\nPhoenix:\n\"Bennifer\"? \"Katty Tom\"? I never heard of either of them.\nButz:\nAnyway... Dude! Katty Tom chose Hollywood over me! Can you believe it?\nMaya:\nWell, actually... Anyway sounds like you had quite the adventure.\nButz:\nWomen! They're so... so... Aaaah! Oh... B-But you're different, Maya. You're not like the rest.\nPhoenix:\n(...Looks like he's still the same old Larry.)\nWhy are you here? (Changed from [Why you came here] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nSo what are you doing here anyway?\nButz:\nHuh...? What do you mean by that? I'm just a natural-born nice guy, that's all. Well, actually... I picked this up last night while I was working.\nPhoenix:\n...A wallet? You say you found this last night?\nButz:\nYeah, it had a driver's license in it, so I figured I'd just return it myself.\nRon's Wallet added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nHang on... Let me see that for a minute. ... I know it. Dessie's picture is in here.\nButz:\nYeah, I guess he really digs his wife, huh? ... Hey, Nick... It's not what you're thinking at all!\nPhoenix:\nNo, I'm pretty sure it is. You haven't changed a bit.\nButz:\nAw, no way man! I mean, she's a married woman! That's just bad news!\nPhoenix:\n(He really IS here just to check out Ms. DeLite...)\nMaya:\nSo you said you found it at your job, right?\nButz:\nYeah! I'm working for a private security company as a guard! Chicks just love a guy in uniform, you know!\nPhoenix:\n(A security guard, huh. So that's what that uniform is all about...)\nWhy are you here?

Why are you asking that!? Trying to see if I've got an \"alibi\"!?\nPhoenix:\n(Umm... You're not the one on the hook for a crime this time, buddy.)\nButz:\nI guess it was around 1:00 in the morning on the first floor of our company building.\nPhoenix:\n(What was Mr. DeLite's wallet doing there...?)\nButz:\n...Anyway, there's nothing weird about that. After all, he works there.\nMaya:\nHe... works there? You mean... Mr. DeLite?\nButz:\nSure. Here, take a look at this. It's right there in his wallet.\nMaya:\nWhat's this card?\nButz:\nIt's a key card for the security company. See! It's got a serial number on it right there. There's no mistake about it. (Changed form [Hey! It's got a serial number on it right there.

You know about it!?\nButz:\nThat's where I work, yeah. In fact, I'm on the job right now.\nMaya:\nHuh...? So what are you doing here then?\nButz:\nWell, the boss is away right now, and you know what mice do when the cat's away...\nPhoenix:\n...Yes, yes. *sigh* Anyway, how far away is this company?\nButz:\nLemme see... About 30 minutes by car, I guess... Well, if you fly down the road, anyway.\nPhoenix:\nHmm. Well, this apartment building is pretty close to Lordly Tailor, right?\nMaya:\nAnd it would take roughly an hour to go from here to KB Security and back.\nPhoenix:\nIf Ron DeLite was at KB Security when the robbery occurred, then...\nMaya:\nWhoa...! Then he couldn't have stolen Sacred Urn!\nPresent\nTreasure Exhibit Poster, Ami Fey's Golden Statue, Sacred Urn, or Shichishito\nPhoenix:\nLarry, this is one of the treasures from Kurain Village...\nButz:\nBe serious, Nick! I couldn't care less about mystic mumbo jumbo stuff!\nMaya:\n...\nButz:\nAh! Of course Maya is a different story!\nPhoenix:\n(Talk about your mixed messages...)\nBlackmail Letter\nPhoenix:\nHey Larry, what about this?\nButz:\nWhat? If you've got something to say, then say it already! ... Huh...? A blackmail letter!?\nPhoenix:\nDo you know anything about this?\nButz:\nWh-Wha-What? I don't know anything about Alexis! And that's the truth!\nPhoenix:\n... Huh? What?\nButz:\nI-I can't believe you'd do this to me! I thought you were my friend! Fifty thousand dollars! I don't have that kind of money!\nPhoenix:\nNo, no, you don't understand! This blackmail letter was sent to Ron DeLite!\nButz:\nWheeeew! Man, you scared me!! I almost had a heart attack, you idiot!\nPhoenix:\nWait, I'm the idiot!?\nButz:\nMan, I was totally confused because it says, \"KB Security\" right on the envelope.\nMaya:\nUm, yeah... So what?\nButz:\nThat's where I've got a part-time job! At KB Security!\nMaya:\nWh... Whaaaat!\nPhoenix:\n(Sounds like I should really find out some more about this KB Security company!)\nRon's Wallet\nPhoenix:\nYou didn't touch anything in the wallet, did you?\nButz:\nHey man, be serious! You know what I was interested in!\nPhoenix:\n(If Mask☆DeMasque doesn't look out, he's gonna be the victim of a robbery himself!)\nKey Card\nPhoenix:\nSo you're sure about this key card?\nButz:\nYup. That's the key card we use at the building I work in. (Changed from [Yup. That's the key card they use at the building I work in.] in the original release) According to the serial number, this one is for the CEO's office.

So what's the deal between you and this girl?\nMaya:\nHey! That's my cousin! Her name is Pearl Fey.\nButz:\nPearl, huh... Too bad. Never date two girls with the same name...

We can't just open his private property!\nMaya:\nDon't be such a fuddy-duddy! This is an important investigation!\nPhoenix:\n(That's true... And truth be told, I have to admit I am kind of curious...)\nMaya:\nWell? What's in there?\nPhoenix:\nH-Hang on a sec. I'm taking it out now... (Whatever it is, it feels... kinda hard... and smooth...)\nAtmey:\n...Well, hello there!!\nMaya:\nEEEEEEK! H-He's here!\nAtmey:\n...What are you doing, Sir Lawyer? I'm shocked to see a servant of the court ignoring the law so flagrantly!\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm really sorry! M-Maya made me do it!\nMaya:\nNick! I can't believe you!\nAtmey:\nA gentlemen never uses a lady as an excuse for his own poor behavior... The real question is... Can you afford to waste time lollygagging about here?\nPhoenix:\nWh-What do you mean by that?\nAtmey:\nPerhaps I should make myself more clear? Tomorrow's trial... Zvarri! Shall we say the figurative Sir William will be dropping his panties before lunchtime?\nMaya:\nWow, Nick! Sounds like it's gonna be really exciting.\nExamine\nBag\nMaya:\nSo what's in there, Nick? What's in the bag?\nPhoenix:\nThe way Atmey barged in like that, I never actually got the chance to look!\nPearl:\nI know.

What's going to happen at the trial tomorrow that's so dramatic?\nAtmey:\nDo you know what your biggest mistake so far has been, Sir Lawyer? ...It was becoming a lawyer in the first place.\nPearl:\n...That certainly does sound like a big mistake, Mr. Nick.\nAtmey:\nTomorrow will be a day to remember. I, Luke Atmey, will take the stand! And then... Zvarri! My testimony will prove to be the undoing of the lot of you! Yes! All of you! I will unmask you as the thief's co-conspirators!\nMaya:\nC-C-Conspirators!?\nAtmey:\nHee hee hee hee hee... You're quick on the defensive, I see! However! It is not I that is your greatest enemy! There is a far more dangerous threat that you will face during the trial.\nMaya:\nWh-What are you talking about...?\nAtmey:\nSir Lawyer... If you truly are who you say, I'm sure you've heard of him. ...His name is \"Godot\".\nPhoenix:\nG-Godot...?\nDeMasque's identity\nAtmey:\nYou have taken a step down the path of foolishness. To try to defend a career criminal who deserves nothing less than the death penalt--\nMaya:\nHey! Last time I checked, no one knows for sure that Mr. DeLite really is DeMasque!\nAtmey:\nHee hee hee hee hee... My dear lady... Times may change, but people, sadly, do not... ...Well. You will understand this when you are more mature.\nGodot (appears after \"Tomorrow's trial\")\nMaya:\nUm... Who is this \"Godot\" person...?\nAtmey:\n...It's not surprising that a spirit medium has not heard the name. Godot. The prosecutor whose equal cannot be found in this country, but in heaven. Godot. A legend or myth... Men pin a lifetime of hopes on the chance to simply meet him.\nPearl:\nProsecutor Godot... (Changed from [Prosecutor...] in the original release)\nMaya:\nBut the best prosecutor in the country isn't Godot, it's Mr. Edgeworth! Isn't that right, Nick!?\nAtmey:\n...It's no surprise that a spirit medium such as yourself would know nothing of this. But Ace Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth is currently traveling abroad.\nMaya:\nHuh...?\nAtmey:\nIn fact, it was Mr. Edgeworth who acknowledged Godot as the best in this country.\nPearl:\nAnd you agree with that?\nAtmey:\nMost certainly. In fact, you could call him the Luke Atmey of the Prosecutor's Office.\nMaya:\nWell, that's good to hear! The prosecution has a fighting chance tomorrow!\nPearl:\nMr. Nick, is this \"Godot\" really that strong?\nPhoenix:\nHmm... I seem to remember hearing about something like that...\nAtmey:\nNot surprising... Some people spend their entire lives idly waiting for his appearance.\nPresent\nAnything\nMaya:\nUmmm, Mr. Atmey...? Could you take a look at this?\nAtmey:\nOh please. You can drop the pretense already.\nMaya:\nHuh...?\nAtmey:\nYou and I are already fated to fight each other...

That's a rule to live by.\nJudge:\n...Um, wh-who are you?\nGodot:\nI am Godot. Legendary prosecutor. I've never lost a case.\nMaya:\nAh! He's the one that Detective Atmey was talking about...\nJudge:\nYes, your reputation precedes you. What kind of cases have you dealt with so far?\nGodot:\nHa...! None.\nJudge:\nWhat did you say...?\nGodot:\nI've never prosecuted a case before.\nJudge:\nN-Never? But you said you've never lost before.\nGodot:\n...Exactly. I've never lost. I've never won before either.\nJudge:\nQuite arrogant for a beginner, aren't you?\nGodot:\nEven the mightiest of redwoods begin their lives as mere saplings.\nJudge:\nYes, but... A mask? In a court of law?\nGodot:\nHa...! Don't you know anything? No matter the man, we all wear masks... Either on our faces or ever our hearts.\nJudge:\n...!\nMaya:\nThis guy is the real deal alright, Nick...\nPhoenix:\n(Why does it seem like all prosecutors are the \"real deal\"...?)\nGodot:\nSo we finally meet... Mr. Phoenix Trite!\nPhoenix:\n...?\nMaya:\nN-Nick! Is he a friend of yours?\nPhoenix:\nNo. I don't have any friends that call me \"Trite\". (Just who is this masked man...?)\nGodot:\nI've returned from the depths of Hell... To do battle with you.\nJudge:\nWell then, err, Prosecutor Gobo.\nGodot:\nIt's not \"Gobo\". It's Godot... Your Honor.\nJudge:\nIn any case, please give your opening statement.\nGodot:\nOpening statement? Those things are not fit for even dogs to consume. I have only one thing to say before we start. To you... Mr. Trite.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What is it?\nGodot:\nAre you familiar with the saying, \"A chain is only as strong as its weakest link\"? I wonder... how much you can withstand before you and your case break in two...?\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\nHmm... Well then, let's hear from the first witness!\nGumshoe:\nUm, my name is...\nGodot:\nNo one asked for your name, witness.\nGumshoe:\n...Urk.\nGodot:\nThe important thing is what you know... That's all. Start talking. ...We're listening.\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir.\nJudge:\nAlright, witness. First, let's hear about... What you know about the thief that stole the urn.\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir!\nWitness Testimony\n-- Mask☆DeMasque's Crimes --\nGumshoe:\nMask☆DeMasque is a master thief that first started his crime spree 6 months ago.\nHe's so confident that he sends his calling card before he even commits the crime!\nThis was his fifth heist, and as usual, he sent a card on to Lordly Tailor.\nHis pattern is to always go after only the most precious art pieces.\nThat's why we're sure it was Mask☆DeMasque, sir. It fits his M. O. to a T!\nJudge:\nHmm... So then the actual identity of this Mask☆DeMasque is... M-Mr. Godot! W-What are you--!? (Changed from [M-Mr. Godot! Y-You!] in the original release) W-We're in the middle of a trial here, Mr. Godot!\nGodot:\nBlacker than a moonless night, hotter and more bitter than Hell itself... That is coffee. I'm sure you can grant me at least this much... Your Honor. Oh, please. Proceed.\nJudge:\n... Very well. It's only coffee, after all.\nPhoenix:\n(What!? You can't be letting him slide this early in the trial!)\nJudge:\nProceed with your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.\nMaya:\nWell, Nick? What are you going to do?\nPhoenix:\nAs long as they haven't brought up Mr. DeLite's identity... ...all we can do is show that it wasn't Mask☆DeMasque who stole the urn.\nCross Examination\n-- Mask☆DeMasque's Crimes --\nGumshoe:\nMask☆DeMasque is a master thief that first started his crime spree 6 months ago.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHave you been involved in the investigation from the beginning?\nGumshoe:\nYup! Nobody knows more about the thief than me, pal! It's true! I'm a... Zvarri...! \"Author on thieves\"!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nAn \"author\"...? He's written books about thieves?\nPhoenix:\nUm, I think he probably meant to say \"authority\".\nGumshoe:\nThe fact that this guy can slip through even my fingers shows how good he is, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(It's easy when those fingers happen to be \"butter fingers\"...)\nPress harder\nPhoenix:\nSo nobody knows more about the thief than you, huh...?\nGumshoe:\nYou got it, pal! Except maybe for the thief's mom, that is!\nPhoenix:\nBut isn't there someone who knows even more about him than the police?\nGumshoe:\nYou don't mean... \"Detective Zvarri\", do you?\nJudge:\nHmm... Who is this person? Zvarri? He sounds German...\nGumshoe:\nHis name is Luke Atmey, sir. I guess I shouldn't have made up such a silly name for him.\nPhoenix:\n(What the heck? I guess he's not all that famous after all...)\nGumshoe:\nAnyway, it's true that he did manage to retrieve the last item the thief stole.\nJudge:\n...Oh, I see. It seems you're not the expert you claim to be.\nGumshoe:\n...Urk! I-It looks like the thief is playing with me, even now!\nLeads back to cross-examination\nLeave it\nPhoenix:\n(The real \"authority\" on the thief is the other detective. I don't need to ask this one any more questions...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nGumshoe:\nHe's so confident that he sends his calling card before he even commits the crime!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHave you seen all of these so-called \"calling cards\"?\nGumshoe:\nOf course I have. Except... The person in charge of the Treasure Exhibit never brought their card to the police... So I didn't see this one until after the crime occurred.\nMaya:\nThat's because Detective Atmey stopped Ms. Andrews from taking it to the police.\nJudge:\nWas the calling card that Lordly Tailor received authentic?\nGumshoe:\nWell, all the cards have one common, identifying feature. But we're not releasing that information to the general public...\nJudge:\nBut you're absolutely certain that this card is real?\nPhoenix:\n(Gumshoe can't say it out loud but I bet he's talking about Mask☆DeMasque's emblem...)\nGumshoe:\nThis was his fifth heist, and as usual, he sent a card on to Lordly Tailor.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHis fifth heist... And your fifth screw up, huh?\nGumshoe:\nObjection, pal! That ain't fair! Maybe you could say I screwed up four times! But this last time wasn't my fault! I didn't know about the calling card this time!\nPhoenix:\n(You of all people shouldn't be chuckling about this, Detective Gumshoe...)\nGumshoe:\nI just want everyone here in the courtroom to know something! If you ever get a calling card from this guy, don't call some stupid private eye! Call your local police right away. Got me?\nMaya:\nWow, it looks like he's really got it in for Detective Atmey.\nGumshoe:\nHis pattern is to always go after only the most precious art pieces.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nArt pieces? Like what, for example?\nGumshoe:\nWell, his first target was the famous \"Tear of Emanon\".\nJudge:\nWhat's that? Some kind of especially salty teardrop?\nGumshoe:\nN-No, sir. It's a blue diamond. A single, rare diamond. Next was the \"Crown of Bongora\"... You know, the thing you put on your head. After that was the \"Left Hand of Hades\" and then the \"Portrait of Mejeena\", sir. Detective Atmey retrieved the \"Portrait of Mejeena\" and returned it to the museum.\nPhoenix:\nAnd the target of his fifth and last robbery was the \"Sacred Urn\"... right?\nJudge:\nBut isn't it difficult for him to dispose of such famous art pieces...?\nGumshoe:\nWell, we assume he must have some underworld connections.\nMaya:\nSomehow, Mr. DeLite doesn't look the type...\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, he's a little too sunny to be hanging out in the underworld...)\nPresent Sacred Urn\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"...Can I ask you a little something, Detective Gumshoe?\"\nGumshoe:\nThat's why we're sure it was Mask☆DeMasque, sir. It fits his M. O. to a T!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean when you say, \"it fits his M. O. to a T\"?\nJudge:\nI was thinking of asking the same thing myself.\nGumshoe:\nUgh... I wish you would listen a little more closely, pal. First of all, there's the calling card. We're 100% certain it's authentic. Then there's the fact that he seemed to know all about the security system. And finally, his target was an art piece. These are all part of the thief's modus operandi.\nJudge:\nAnd so, since this robbery seems to fit all those conditions...?\nGumshoe:\nThat's right! It means that Mask☆DeMasque is behind it!\nPresent Sacred Urn\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"...Can I ask you a little something, Detective Gumshoe?\"\nMaya:\nNick! It definitely looks like it was Mask☆DeMasque who stole the urn!\nPhoenix:\nBut there's no real evidence either way as to whether Ron DeLite is Mask☆DeMasque.\nMaya:\nBut... But...\nPhoenix:\nAlso, the urn hasn't turned up yet, let alone in connection to Mr. DeLite himself.\nMaya:\nSo even though we know it was Mask☆DeMasque that did it...\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe for the time being, I should try to show it wasn't Mask☆DeMasque that did it!)\nPhoenix:\n...Can I ask you a little something, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\n...Just hearing the \"little\" in that question is making me nervous.\nPhoenix:\nYou said that he always \"goes after the most precious art pieces\", right?\nGumshoe:\nThat's right, pal.\nPhoenix:\nBut there's one problem... That's not what he did in this case. The supposedly \"priceless\" urn doesn't exactly rise to the level of \"precious art\"!\nGumshoe:\nWh-What do you mean!?\nMaya:\nN-Nick! How can you say such a terrible thing!?\nPhoenix:\nNo! I meant from a financial point of view! I mean, it wouldn't fetch a good price.\nJudge:\nWell, Prosecutor Godot? What is the value of that urn?\nGodot:\nThe appraisers I spoke to said they couldn't attach a price to it. And I mean that in the worst sense.\nPhoenix:\nSo in other words... It was not the kind of item that Mask☆DeMasque would normally go after!\nGumshoe:\nUrk!\nJudge:\nHmm... If I understand you correctly, Mr. Wright... ...you're saying that the theft of the Sacred Urn was not the work of Mask☆DeMasque...!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes... That's what I'm saying. (Actually all I did was point out the contradiction. The argument made itself, but...)\nJudge:\nWell... First of all, we need to get this issue cleared up. Was this last robbery the work of Mask☆DeMasque or not? What do you have to say about this, Mr. Godot?\nGodot:\nThis coffee here... It's my own special blend. I call it Godot #107. I'm trying to decide whether to cut down on the acidity or the bitterness... That's the only thing I've got on my mind right now... ...Mr. Trite!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!?\nGodot:\nIf you're really a man, you should clean up your own mess.\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Sorry, but I didn't get what you mean.\nGodot:\nIf you're saying it wasn't Mask☆DeMasque that stole the urn... ...then it must be someone imitating Mask☆DeMasque's methods... A fake.\nJudge:\nA-A Fake☆DeMasque?\nMaya:\nFake☆DeMasque? That sounds so ridiculous. ...But I like it.\nGodot:\nNow, before I decide on my coffee, I believe some proof is in order, Mr. Trite. Proof that the person who appeared at Lordly Tailor that night was actually a fake.\nJudge:\nHmm... Though I don't approve of Mr. Godot's behavior, his point is valid. Mr. Wright. ...We're waiting.\nPhoenix:\n(It looks like I'm going to have to prove it... I need proof that the person at Lordly Tailor that night was in fact, Fake☆DeMasque!)\nPresent Security Camera Photo\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"The proof is right here.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nJudge:\nWhat is this evidence supposed to prove?\nGodot:\nHa...! Well, it proves someone here is a fake alright. ...It proves that this lawyer is a fake.\nPhoenix:\n(These prosecutors sure know how to twist the knife...)\nMaya:\nThis is no time to be impressed! Think it over again! When he stole the urn, his photo was taken, right? Who knows? Maybe there's something on there that shows he's a fake...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Is she talking about that photo we got from Atmey?)\nJudge:\nAre you ready yet, Mr. Wright?\nLeads back to:\n\"It looks like I'm going to have to prove it...\"\nPhoenix:\nThe proof is right here.\nJudge:\nThis looks like... a photo taken by a security camera.\nPhoenix:\nBut if you look closely... you'll notice something peculiar about it.\nGodot:\nHa...! Well then, why don't you go ahead and show us what it is. Go on. Use this pointer and show us just what about this picture is so \"peculiar\".\nPresent front of Mask☆DeMasque's neck\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"It's right here, of course!\"\nPresent anywhere else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nIt's right here. ...I think.\nJudge:\nIs that what was so \"peculiar\"?\nGodot:\nHa...! The place that you're pointing to is all wrong.\nPhoenix:\nWh... What do you mean!\nGodot:\nThe only thing \"peculiar\" in this courtroom... is on top of your head.\nMaya:\nNick! Are you going to let him get away making fun of your hair!?\nPhoenix:\n(Yes... At least until I know he can't use his goggles to fry me or something...) W-Well anyway! There is a strange spot in this photo!\nGodot:\nHa...! Still haven't given up? So what is it then?\nLeads back to:\n\"Go on. Use this pointer and show us just what about this picture is so \"peculiar\".\"\nPhoenix:\nIt's right here, of course!\nJudge:\nYou mean... Mask☆DeMasque?\nPhoenix:\nI have here a piece of reference I would like the court to take a look at.\nMaya:\nIsn't that the publicity photo I bought this morning...?\nPhoenix:\nThe problem I have with the security camera photo is the broach on DeMasque's chest.\nJudge:\nA Breach? Here!? Bailiff! Get my steed! We need to retreat at once!\nPhoenix:\n...A broach, Your Honor. It's a sort of clasp for holding one's cape on.\nJudge:\nA clasp, eh... Ah! I see now!\nGumshoe:\nBut the Mask☆DeMasque in the security camera photo... Ahh!! He has no broach!!\nPhoenix:\nThat broach is the same as the emblem on DeMasque's calling card and serves as his symbol. But the thief that broke into Lordly Tailor wasn't wearing a broach... In other words, this \"Mask☆DeMasque\" is a fake!\nGumshoe:\n...! I-I've been fooled agaaaaaain!\nJudge:\nO-Order! It's true... Undeniably true... Detective Gumshoe! How... How could you have overlooked this!?\nGumshoe:\nI-I'm sorry, sir! I don't know how I...\nGodot:\nHey now... ...If you're gonna have a pity party, invite me, too!\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Godot! You deserve some blame in this, too! How could you have overlooked such a large broach...?\nGodot:\nHa...! The broach you're talking about... Do you mean this?\nGumshoe:\nAh...!\nPhoenix:\nTh-That's...! Mask☆DeMasque's broach!\nJudge:\nWh-Where did you find it!?\nGodot:\nWell I've always had a good nose for evidence... I got it at the crime scene. It was hidden in the shadow of a big female Buddha statue.\nPhoenix:\n(\"Buddha statue\"...? He must mean the Ami Fey statue.)\nGumshoe:\nWh-Why didn't you tell me about that, sir!?\nGodot:\n...I always put evidence away in my pocket. ...After all, it's the safest place for crucial evidence.\nMaya:\nGrrr... This guy is one cool customer.\nGodot:\nIt's a little early to be shaken up, isn't it, little lady? ...That friend of yours left pretty little hickeys on there, too.\nJudge:\nH-Hickeys?\nGodot:\nFiguratively speaking, of course... I'm referring to Ron DeLite's fingerprints.\nGumshoe:\nWhaaa...?\nJudge:\nWhat!? The defendant's fingerprints are on the broach!? Order! Order in the court! Mr. Godot! Let's see that broach!\nGodot:\nI've grown attached to my metallic girlfriend here. ...Take good care of her.\nJudge:\nHmm... She-- I mean, it appears to have been torn off some clothing. There's a little bit of cloth left on the back.\nGodot:\nObviously there must have been a big struggle that night at the crime scene.\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh... Phoenix, we have a problem...)\nDeMasque's Broach added to the Court Record.\nGodot:\nHa...! You mess with Godot... ...and you get burned.\nPhoenix:\n(Grr... He's been playing me like a violin...)\nGodot:\nWell Judge, I'm about ready to call my next witness.\nGumshoe:\nHuh? You're done with me? But I haven't proved anything yet.\nGodot:\nYou've proven your own incompetence. That's good enough.\nGumshoe:\n...That doesn't sound good at all.\nJudge:\nBailiff! Bring the next witness into the courtroom!\nPhoenix:\n(Finally time for the Ace Detective to make his appearance, huh...?)\nGodot:\nOne second is one drip of the coffee pot. Let's hurry it up.\nAtmey:\nSHHH! SILENCE!... Hee hee hee hee hee... Now I see. It's all becoming clear.\nJudge:\nWh-What's clear?\nAtmey:\n...Zvarri! The truth has once again been elegantly revealed to me! What we have here is... A judge and a prosecutor. ...A coffee maniac, at that! ...Am I correct?\nJudge:\nW-Well, yes. That's right.\nGodot:\nHa...! Not bad. Not bad at all. You're the first person that's ever been able to penetrate my secret veil.\nAtmey:\nWell, Sir Prosecutor. Let me introduce myself. My name is Luke Atmey, Ace Detective and rising star illuminating the heavens.\nMaya:\nBoy, these two make a perfect pair...\nPhoenix:\nThey'd either be best friends or they'd tear each other's heads off.\nJudge:\nI've heard that on the night of the crime, you were all alone on security detail.\nAtmey:\n...You have heard correctly. My specially-made monocle is worth more than a hundred Detective Gumshoes. ...If Detective Gumshoe was worth anything, that is.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\n(Why was this guy all by himself anyway...? There must be some reason. I'm sure of it!)\nJudge:\nWell then, tell us what this special monocle of yours witnessed!\nWitness Testimony\n-- What I Witnessed --\nAtmey:\nIt was approximately 1 o'clock in the morning... just after the date changed.\nThat's when my nemesis, the infamous Mask☆DeMasque, dancingly descended upon me!\nJust as I began to turn, the coward struck a fierce blow upon my noble head!\nDarkness swallowed me before I could land a single strike. When I awoke, he was gone.\nThirty minutes later, I used an emergency phone to notify the police!\nJudge:\nSo you didn't get a clear look at the criminal?\nAtmey:\nMy specially-made monocle never misses a thing. However! That is limited to things that fall within my own visual range! But of course, that's only natural.\nJudge:\n...I fall to see why the witness seems so proud of his performance that evening.\nAtmey:\nWell, Sir Old-Timer, let me explain. We are not speaking of any ordinary thief... ...but of the kings of thieves! The great Mask☆DeMasque, my arch-enemy! That is what my instincts and my years of experience tell me!\nJudge:\nHmm... Very well. Proceed with the cross-examination, Mr. Wright.\nCross Examination\n-- What I Witnessed --\nAtmey:\nIt was approximately 1 o'clock in the morning... just after the date changed.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo that would be one o'clock on the morning of the 12th, correct?\nAtmey:\nThat's an impressive deduction, Sir Lawyer.\nPhoenix:\nYou were on security duty that night. Where exactly were you at the time?\nAtmey:\nA penetrating question! I was in the basement warehouse, near the computer.\nPhoenix:\n(Near the computer, huh...)\nJudge:\nSo then you weren't trying to remain hidden, I take it?\nAtmey:\nUp to this point, I have tried to remain concealed while waiting for the thief...\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, he said the same thing yesterday, too.)\nMaya:\nGumshoe also said that he never saw him at the crime scene...\nAtmey:\nPrecisely! That is precisely why I chose NOT to hide last night. I knew that by NOT concealing myself, I would be putting pressure on the thief.\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like the thief was the one applying pressure... On your pidgeony head, that is.)\nAtmey:\nIn any case!\nAtmey:\nThat's when my nemesis, the infamous Mask☆DeMasque, dancingly descended upon me!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\n\"Dancingly descended\"...? From where exactly?\nAtmey:\nWell... From the entrance, I suppose. Where else?\nPhoenix:\n(So in actuality, he neither \"danced\" nor \"descended\"! ...Someone please save me.) Um... So how is it that you didn't notice the thief?\nAtmey:\nMy eyes were looking for the thief's shadow while my ears listened for his footfalls. But even so, the dastardly criminal managed to sneak up on me... It can only be due to his subtly camouflaged cape and soft-soled shoes.\nPhoenix:\n(... I hereby dub you \"Ace Dunce\".)\nAtmey:\nJust as I began to turn, the coward struck a fierce blow upon my noble head!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou didn't see the criminal's face when that happened?\nAtmey:\n...Well, that's difficult part. How should I put it... I saw his mask... That's all that I can recall.\nJudge:\nHmm... That's not very solid as far as testimony goes.\nAtmey:\nHowever... Fortunately I had my third monocle, the security camera, at the ready. It captured his image perfectly... This should be sufficient, I believe?\nJudge:\nHmm, well, as long as this photo is authentic, I don't see a problem here. Well, Mr. Godot? Do you have a problem with the photo? Good. Then let's continue with the testimony.\nPresent DeMasque's Broach\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"...Mr. Atmey.\"\nAtmey:\nDarkness swallowed me before I could land a single strike. When I awoke, he was gone.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAttacked and knocked unconscious? And you weren't able to do a thing? There's certainly some very impressive detective work.\nAtmey:\nHmph! Well, Sir Lawyer! Have you ever been suddenly struck on the head?\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? W-Well.. Actually, yes. By a fire extinguisher.\nAtmey:\nAnd what happened?\nPhoenix:\n...I-I was knocked out.\nMaya:\nAnd you lost your memory, too!\nAtmey:\nYou see? You have no right to look down on me then, do you? The only reason I didn't lose my memory was because I have more brains to begin with.\nPhoenix:\n(He may have brains, but the wiring to the self-reflection part seems to be served...)\nAtmey:\nIn any case, that was how I was knocked senseless. And then...\nPresent DeMasque's Broach\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"...Mr. Atmey.\"\nAtmey:\nThirty minutes later, I used an emergency phone to notify the police!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAbout this \"30 minutes\"...\nAtmey:\nMy silver cord was loosened and my soul fled to the Golden Halls of Elysium...\nMaya:\nAs usual, I have no idea what this guy is saying.\nPhoenix:\nI think he's saying that he was out cold.\nJudge:\nSo... What happened during these 30 minutes?\nAtmey:\nNo one can say, Your Honor... That span of time has truly vanished into the ether!\nPhoenix:\n(Just what is he going on about!?)\nMaya:\nThere's something suspicious about Detective Atmey... How could he not have noticed when the thief came in?\nPhoenix:\nAlso, he says he was knocked unconscious before he could fight back... But that can't be right. It contradicts the evidence.\nMaya:\nHuh? Which piece...?\nPhoenix:\n(The real question is... Why would he tell such an obvious lie?)\nPhoenix:\n...Mr. Atmey. Could you take a look at this with that special monocle of yours?\nAtmey:\nAha! This belongs to the criminal mastermind, my arch-nemesis, Mask☆DeMasque! It is, in point of fact, Mask☆DeMasque's broach!\nPhoenix:\nIt was found on the floor of the basement warehouse. I wonder how that happened?\nAtmey:\nHa... Elementary, my dear lawyer. Obviously it wasn't glued on well enough.\nPhoenix:\nNot quite. It clearly shows signs of having been ripped off a piece of clothing.\nJudge:\nRipped off...? Aha!\nPhoenix:\n...We can only deduce that the thief struggled with someone that night! That's the only thing I can think of. And there's only one person that was in a position to have a struggle with the thief. The only person that was on security duty that night...You, Detective Atmey!\nAtmey:\n...Urk!\nPhoenix:\nDetective Atmey! You must have fought with the thief that night! (Changed from [Detective Atmey! You must have fought with the thief last night!] in the original release) So, why did you lie in your testimony to the court?\nJudge:\nWitness! Giving false testimony is a serious crime!\nAtmey:\nErr, I... N-No! W-Wait just a moment, Sir Old-Timer!\nJudge:\nDon't talk to me like I'm living in a nursing home!\nAtmey:\nHee hee hee he he he... I just remembered, Your Honor. I was just confused because I've been dealing with so many cases lately.\nGodot:\nThe true measure of a man is in the amount of work he does. That's what I always say.\nMaya:\nNick, you can only handle one case at a time... Isn't that right?\nPhoenix:\nYou talk too much.\nJudge:\nWitness! So are you now saying that you and the thief fought?\nGodot:\nHold on. That's quite enough... Your Honor.\nJudge:\nE-Excuse me...?\nGodot:\nSave the big questions for the testimony. That's one of my rules.\nAtmey:\nIndeed! I understand! I, Luke Atmey, agree completely!\nWitness Testimony\n-- Fight With The Thief --\nAtmey:\nIndeed, it's true that I looked away from the door for a brief moment.\nHowever... Luke Atmey cannot be so easily discombobulated!\nUnfortunately, the thief grabbed a weapon from the side and... rendered me senseless.\nA true gentleman fights only with his own fists... But they were not enough.\nHis first blow struck true! Bam! ...And that's all she wrote.\nJudge:\nSo in the end, you did catch a glimpse of Mask☆DeMasque?\nAtmey:\nCorrect. It was during his third crime that he struck me from behind. It seems that my memory has become a tad jumbled, so to speak.\nJudge:\nHmmm... Well, that's certainly understandable. I, myself, always get confused about which testimony goes with which case.\nPhoenix:\n(Th-That can't be good...)\nCross Examination\n-- Fight With The Thief --\nAtmey:\nIndeed, it's true that I looked away from the door for a brief moment.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo why did you look away from the door anyway?\nAtmey:\nIn addition to the camera, I had prepared a variety of other sensors as well. The alarm on one of those had gone off, so I had to check the data. That's why I went to the computer! ...Elegantly, of course!\nPhoenix:\nSo you were momentarily vulnerable when you were working on the computer? (What should I do? Should I ask some more questions...?)\nThat's enough\nPhoenix:\n(Well, we know for sure that Atmey looked away from the door. I think I should ask about something else now...) Alright. So you looked away from the door. ...And then?\nLeads back to cross-examination\nAbout the sensor\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of sensors are you talking about?\nAtmey:\nThere are other places in the basement that someone could enter and exit from. There are air conditioner ducts, sewer pipes... And a cat door as well. I hooked up heat-detecting, infrared and ultra-violet sensors to each of them.\nPhoenix:\nThat's a lot of hardware... Was it all yours?\nAtmey:\nLordly Tailor Department Store was kind enough to provide the monitoring hardware. Naturally, the security camera that look the photo belongs to them as well.\nPhoenix:\n(In other words, he couldn't have rigged the equipment, huh...?)\nAtmey:\nHee hee hee hee hee... Has that cleared up any doubts you had about me, Sir Lawyer?\nLeads back to cross-examination\nAbout the computer\nPhoenix:\nSo did that computer belong to Lordly Tailor as well?\nAtmey:\nCorrect. Well, except for the program that manages the data. That was specially designed by me, Luke Atmey!\nPhoenix:\n(In that case, he could have easily manipulated the data.)\nAtmey:\nHee hee hee hee hee... What's wrong, Sir Lawyer?\nLeads back to cross-examination\nAtmey:\nHowever... Luke Atmey cannot be so easily discombobulated!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nUmm... What does that mean? \"Discombobulated\"?\nJudge:\nHmm... Young people these days... They really irritate me. They allow perfectly good old words to die until everyone forgets what they mean.\nPhoenix:\nSorry, but what exactly DOES it mean anyway?\nJudge:\n...Now I've forgotten. What was I saying?\nPhoenix:\n(Jeez. It's better than old people who forget what they were saying 5 seconds ago!)\nGodot:\n...Well, it looks like we've cleared that up. You can go on with your testimony.\nAtmey:\nUnfortunately, the thief grabbed a weapon from the side and... rendered me senseless.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean by \"weapon from the side\"?\nAtmey:\nNaturally, that thief had no idea that I, Luke Atmey, was hiding in the area! He grabbed the sword from the statue that was standing by the door to the warehouse.\nPhoenix:\nSword...? You mean the sword that was all twisted like a tree branch?\nAtmey:\nCorrect. Fortunately for me, the blade was not sharp.\nPhoenix:\n(OK. so he IS talking about the Shichishito...)\nJudge:\nSo the thief armed himself with a sword. And what about yourself, witness?\nAtmey:\nA true gentleman fights only with his own fists... But they were not enough.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou had that much faith in your own fighting abilities?\nAtmey:\nBut of course. In college, I was the 2nd in-charge of the boxing club.\nJudge:\nI'm sorry if I fail to find that appropriately impressive.\nAtmey:\nHowever! My opponent in the ring this time was my arch-nemesis, Mask☆DeMasque!\nPhoenix:\n(This guy is a real piece of work...)\nAtmey:\nHis first blow struck true! Bam! ...And that's all she wrote.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nCan you tell us a little more about what happened?\nAtmey:\nMy opponent was both powerful and vicious. You might say he was... \"powericious\".\nPhoenix:\n(\"P-Powericious\"?)\nAtmey:\nI assumed the \"Atmey Fighting Stance\", but a sudden flash of light blinded me! That of course was checkmate! My opponent had bested me.\nPhoenix:\n(What do I do now? Should I ask more about this...?)\nLeave it\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I guess it's true that Atmey was knocked senseless after all. I'd better ask him about something else instead...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\"You were blinded\"?\nPhoenix:\nSo what was this flash of light that blinded you?\nAtmey:\n...I was bathed in a golden light that seemed to come from the statue of the woman.\nPhoenix:\n(The statue of Ami Fey, I'm guessing...)\nMaya:\nWell that wasn't very much help at all...\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\"Atmey Fighting Style\"?\nPhoenix:\nWhat is this \"Atmey Fighting Style\"?\nAtmey:\nI'm sorry but that's a trade secret... I really can't say any more. But, I suppose I can tell you if I absolutely must. The main thing is to put your back to the wall. That way no one can get behind you.\nPhoenix:\n(That's it...? That's the \"Atmey Fighting Style\"?)\nJudge:\nHmmm... Well, Mr. Wright? What about that testimony...?\nIt was a waste of time.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I guess it's true that Atmey was knocked senseless after all. I'd better ask him about something else instead...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nIt was very important.\nPhoenix:\nOf course it's important! We've learned a detective's SECRET technique, after all.\nJudge:\nYes, indeed... I'll remember to use it if I ever take a walk alone late at night.\nPhoenix:\n(Why the heck is he eye-balling me like that...? It's creeping me out...)\nJudge:\n...Now then, witness! We'll go ahead and add that secret information to your official testimony!\nChanges statement from \"His first blow struck true! Bam! ...And that's all she wrote.\" to \"I put my back to the wall to fight, but the thief's blow landed upon my third eye.\"\nAtmey:\nI put my back to the wall to fight, but the thief's blow landed upon my third eye.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Where is this \"third eye\" you're talking about?\nAtmey:\nOh... it's right between my right and left eye brows. ...It's quite invisible to the unenlightened. You may call it the forehead, if you like.\nPhoenix:\n(Why didn't you just say that in the first place!?)\nAtmey:\nSir Lawyer! It looks like the creases in your own forehead are getting deeper!\nMaya:\nSo Mr. Atmey got hit on the forehead then?\nPhoenix:\nThat's what he says.\nMaya:\nHmm... I've got a funny feeling about that.\nPhoenix:\n(Actually, so do I.)\nPresent Shichishito\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Detective Atmey! Your testimony is crumbling like a house of cards.\"\nMaya:\nWell what do you think, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nWell, there's one thing that I'm absolutely sure of now.\nMaya:\nYeah? What is it!?\nPhoenix:\nThe Luke Atmey guy... He's definitely hiding something!\nMaya:\nB-But why?\nPhoenix:\nI think I'm starting to figure out what really happened that night. (...And about the true nature of this \"detective\".)\nPhoenix:\nDetective Atmey! Your testimony is crumbling like a house of cards.\nAtmey:\nWhat fun this is, Sir Lawyer! It is truly a pleasure to cross swords with you! And now, once again, you have thrown down the gauntlet at my armored feet...\nPhoenix:\nI believe this is what you said yesterday.\nAtmey:\nNo, the coward must have wormed his way in through somewhere besides the door... Then my arch-nemesis struck me on the head from behind with this gruesome item here!\nJudge:\nFrom behind, huh?\nPhoenix:\nBut just now you testified that he struck you on the forehead... I hardly think you could forget where you were hit on the head!\nAtmey:\n...Urk! It seems... I-I've made another mistake.\nPhoenix:\n...Detective Atmey. That's not the only strange part of your testimony.\nJudge:\nWh-What do you mean by that?\nPhoenix:\nFor example... The very fact that you hid the calling card from the police itself is strange! It's almost as if... You were afraid they were going to help with security!\nAtmey:\nU-Urk...! Geniuses such as myself have always been misunderstood! How sad...\nPhoenix:\nThat's wrong!\nGodot:\nGodot:\n...To err is human, to forgive divine. Humans aren't machines... They have souls, feelings. They live, they die, they love, they hate... And yes, they even make mistakes...\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHey, hold on! It-It's not as pretty as that!\nGodot:\nReally? What is it like then!?\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nAlways chase a riddle down to the end. That's one of my rules.\nPhoenix:\n(This is it... This might just be my chance to turn things around!)\nJudge:\n...Mr. Wright. What exactly is it that you're asserting?\nPhoenix:\nVery well, Your Honor. The defense asserts that...\nMr. Atmey is no Ace Detective!\nPhoenix:\nThe truth is... this witness is no Ace Detective at all!\nAtmey:\n...So then what exactly are you saying that I am?\nPhoenix:\nUh, umm... Well, an average detective...?\nJudge:\nI hardly see the relevance of that.\nMaya:\nWh-What are you doing, Nick!? Weren't you going to go on the attack?\nPhoenix:\nI was planning on it, but it looks I'm the one who got attacked instead.\nJudge:\nThink harder next time!\nLeads back to:\n\"...Mr. Wright. What exactly is it that you're asserting?\"\nthis Mr. Atmey is a fake!\nPhoenix:\nThis witness isn't Luke Atmey... He's a fake!\nAtmey:\n...So now it's not just Mask☆DeMasque. You're saying I'm a fake, too?\nPhoenix:\nAn Ace Detective could never be as forgetful as this guy!\nGodot:\nImposters like you are often suspicious of others as well.\nJudge:\nReally, this is too much. Next you'll be calling me a fake, too!\nLeads back to:\n\"...Mr. Wright. What exactly is it that you're asserting?\"\nMr. Atmey is Mask☆DeMasque!\nLeads to:\n\"The answer is simple! It's all clear to me now!\"\nPhoenix:\nThe answer is simple! It's all clear to me now! Detective Luke Atmey's true identity is actually... Mask☆DeMasque!\nAtmey:\nYeeeeaaargggh!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Mr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!?\nPhoenix:\nThere are too many unnatural parts to Mr. Atmey's story. He says he was \"hiding\" at the crime scenes, which is why no one ever saw him there. And then, in his last case, he manages to outperform Detective Gumshoe and... ...the entire police force to \"miraculously\" retrieve the stolen treasure.\nAtmey:\nTh-That's because... I analyzed the crime scene data and made an exquisitely elegant deduction. I picked up clues that the police overlooked in order to arrive at a...\nPhoenix:\nOh, please! The explanation is far simpler than that, \"Detective Atmey\"! The truth is that you are, in fact, Mask☆DeMasque.\nAtmey:\nGurk...!\nJudge:\nB-But Mr. Wright! Th-This photo! It clearly shows Mask☆DeMasque! This security camera belongs to Lordly Tailor Department Store! He shouldn't have been able to manipulate it...\nPhoenix:\nHe didn't need to manipulate it! He gained access to the warehouse under the pretense of providing \"security\"... Then he simply dressed as the \"thief\" and stole the urn.\nJudge:\nSo... the Ace Detective is actually an Ace Thief! Is this true, witness!?\nAtmey:\n... Aha... Hee hee hee ha ha ha Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ho ho ho hee hee hee! DeMasque's M. O. is pure genius! And so am I, Luke Atmey, Ace Detective!! You're very clever to have come to such a conclusion! I am impressed, Sir Lawyer!\nJudge:\nWh-Whaaaaat!? Witness! You... You're admitting it!?\nMaya:\nN-Nick! Now's your chance!\nPhoenix:\nYes! Time to put the last nail in this guy's coffin! Detective Atmey! When you assumed the thief's identity--\nGodot:\nGodot:\nGodot Blend #102... ...My personal favorite.\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Godot!\nGodot:\n\"The Ace Detective is actually an Ace Thief!\" I smell a best-selling novel! There's only one problem... It simply isn't true.\nJudge:\nB-But Mr. Godot! Mr. Wright has made some very strong points and I...\nGodot:\nI will admit my opponent has woven a compelling narrative out of whole cloth. But it is, in fact, nothing more than a patchwork quilt. Mr. Trite... If this detective really is the thief, then show us the proof of your claim. But it had better be as hot... and as perfect as the coffee dripping down your face!\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Wright!? Don't just stand there! This court would like to see this decisive proof you have! Quickly!\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? Oh! Y-Yes, of course! (Wh-What's the big rush...?)\nMaya:\nAre you alright, Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Atmey looks pretty rattled right now... I'd like to finish this right now if I can. But can I really do it?) The decisive evidence that proves Mr. Luke Atmey is in fact Mask☆DeMasque...\nis right here!\nPhoenix:\nAs usual, the defense comes prepared, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nVery well then... Let's see what you've got. Please present proof that Mask☆DeMasque is actually Mr. Luke Atmey!\nPresent anything\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHere's your proof!\nJudge:\nWhat do you think, Mr. Godot?\nGodot:\nIt looks to me like Mr. Trite is still a mite sleepy. Perhaps he'd like a big mug of my special Godot blend? Well?\nPhoenix:\nN-No thanks, I'm fine! Really! (What do I do now? Another mistake like that and I'm through! Without some decisive evidence, I could be risking everything...)\nI've got all I need.\nLeads back to:\n\"As usual, the defense comes prepared, Your Honor!\"\nI don't have a thing.\nLeads to:\n\"Proof? Of course I... I... ...I've got nothing.\"\nhas yet to be found!\nLeads to:\n\"Proof? Of course I... I... ...I've got nothing.\"\nPhoenix:\nProof? Of course I... I... ...I've got nothing.\nGodot:\nHa...! Just what I thought. A man has to told his head up high no matter how bad things get, after all.\nPhoenix:\nUuugh...\nJudge:\nI see... I thought perhaps you had some evidence to back up your assertion...\nPhoenix:\n(This is no good! I've got to stay on the attack! I'll never get another chance to prove that this guy is the thief!)\nMaya:\nDon't give up, Nick! Think harder and try again!\nPhoenix:\nIt's no good... I'm just not ready yet...\nMaya:\nB-But... Are you going to just give up and let us lose this?\nAtmey:\nSo, you've come to your senses, have you, Sir Lawyer?\nPhoenix:\nI... Unnngh... (Argh! I can't think of a counter-attack at all...)\nJudge:\nIt seems the cloud of suspicion surrounding this witness has lifted. Mr. Godot. If you have anything further to add, then--\n???:\nJudge:\nWh... Wh-Who... ...Who are you?\nDesirée:\nThat doesn't really matter right now, does it?\nPhoenix:\nMs. DeLite! What are you doing here?\nDesirée:\nNicky boy! The thing you've been looking for... I think I found it!\nJudge:\nYou mean... that bag!?\nDesirée:\nNo, not the bag! What's in the bag! ...Well?\nJudge:\nTh-That's...\nMaya:\nThe Sacred Urn!! Nick! It's the urn!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order! ...You! Madame...! That urn... Where did you find it!?\nDesirée:\nYou'll never believe it... It was in the office of Mr. Fancy Pants Ace Detective! ...Luke Atmey!\nRon:\nOh, Dessie! You're the best!\nSacred Urn updated in the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nWell? How do you explain that one, Mr. Atmey!?\nAtmey:\n...\nPhoenix:\nEven you are going to have a hard time weaseling out of this one!\nGodot:\nGodot:\nHa...! Pathetic...\nJudge:\nMr. Godot...? Do you have something you wish to say?\nGodot:\nYes, Your Honor... It simply amazes me how quickly times change... In the old days, a man was to be taken at his word. It's truly sad...\nJudge:\nYou're still denying that Mr. Atmey was involved!?\nGodot:\nBefore casting aspersions at Detective Atmey, consider the young lady here. Your name is Desirée... Desirée DeLite. Is that correct?\nDesirée:\nY-Yes! What about it?\nGodot:\nHa...! How charming... The lengths that a woman is willing to go to save her husband is truly inspiring.\nDesirée:\nWh-What are you insinuating!?\nGodot:\nAs the wife of the criminal, you could have \"discovered\" that stolen urn anywhere. Including the office of the good detective here. So you found the urn. What does that prove? It certainly doesn't prove where the urn was before you \"found\" it.\nDesirée:\nWhat...? I just brought it here from the detective's office!\nGodot:\nPlease Madame... This town is already filled to the brim with lies. Any more could only compound the tragedy we have been witness to.\nDesirée:\nYou're wrong! I would never...! I would never do such a thing!\nPhoenix:\nMs. DeLite...\nDesirée:\nPlease, Nicky boy! You've got to help me talk some sense into these people!\nPhoenix:\n(There must be some way! I've got to prove that urn was actually in the Atmey Detective Agency...)\nTestify about what I saw\nPhoenix:\n...\nGodot:\nWhat's wrong? Isn't it your job to come up with something to say...?\nMaya:\nNick! Come on! It should be easy to prove! After all, we checked out that bag, didn't we?\nPhoenix:\nYou're right. I remember doing that. Whatever was in there, it was hard and round... And smooth, too.\nMaya:\nYes! It must have been the urn! It must have!\nPhoenix:\nBut... I never actually saw it with my own eyes.\nMaya:\n...?\nPhoenix:\nAtmey walked in just when I was about to have a look at it... So even if it was the urn in there, I can't testify that it was.\nMaya:\nAck! You're right!!\nGodot:\nHa...! It looks like I was wrong about you, Mr. Trite. In this town overflowing with lies, there's still a single flickering candle of truth.\nDesirée:\nNicky boy...!\nPhoenix:\n(Well, it's true that I never actually saw the urn... But maybe I can still testify about it from another angle!)\nJudge:\nWhat about it, Mr. Wright? Have you given up yet...?\nLeads back to:\n\"There must be some way!\"\nShow fingerprints on the urn\nPhoenix:\nI can prove where the urn was... ...by the fingerprints on it!\nJudge:\nFingerprints, eh...\nAtmey:\nOh come now! Now you're really making me laugh, Sir Lawyer! Fingerprints indeed!\nPhoenix:\n...\nAtmey:\nMay I go on? Good. Now it would be perfectly understandable if my fingerprints were on the urn. After all, it was I who was guarding the urn in the first place! In any case, I am always in the habit of wearing gloves as you can see. So unfortunately, my fingerprints wouldn't be evidence of anything.\nJudge:\nWhat about it, Mr. Wright? This witness's fingerprints would mean nothing anyway.\nMaya:\nN-Nick, what are you going to do now?\nPhoenix:\n(I've come too far to turn back now! Atmey must have brought the urn back to his office yesterday... And there, I'm sure someone must have left their fingerprints on it...!) The defense proposes that the fingerprints of this person should be on the urn!\nPresent Phoenix Wright profile\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"So what is all this fuss about fingerprints anyway...?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nGodot:\nLet me give you an important piece of advice. The one who keeps a cool head all the way until the game's end is the winner.\nJudge:\nLet me give you an even more important piece of advice, Mr. Wright... You are not going to win this game with that answer.\nMaya:\nWow... Even the judge is making cool, snappy remarks now...\nPhoenix:\n(D-Does that mean I was wrong again? Hmm... The urn was put in that bag and carried to the detective's office yesterday. That means the person I should be fingering is... the person who left their prints on the urn yesterday at the Atmey Detective Agency!)\nMaya:\nDo you really think there's someone that could fit the bill?\nName another person\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? What have you decided?\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! Please give me just one more chance!\nLeads back to:\n\"The defense proposes that the fingerprints of this person should be on the urn!\"\nThink it over again\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? What have you decided to do?\nPhoenix:\nForgive me, Your Honor. I've decided to think the whole thing over again.\nLeads back to:\n\"There must be some way!\"\nI can't prove anything yet\nPhoenix:\nI can't prove anything yet.\nMaya:\nBut Nick!\nJudge:\nVery well... It looks like that's all then.\nGodot:\nExactly... And this urn is all the proof I need to make my case...\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nGodot:\nYou still don't get it, huh? Listen closely, Mr. Trite. This is the urn that Mask☆DeMasque stole, right? Now the wife of the accused comes strolling in here with the very same urn, correct? Now, who would you think is the thief?\nPhoenix:\nAh...!\nDesirée:\nNo! That's wrong! That's not why I've got it...\nMaya:\nN-Nick! Y-You can't let him do this...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, this isn't good... There has to be another way around this...) Your Honor! Please let me think it over one more time!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. It's high time that you learn your lesson. The courtroom is no place for poorly thought-out or rash declarations!\nPhoenix:\n(I have to be careful... He won't be so nice next time...)\nLeads back to:\n\"There must be some way!\"\nAtmey:\nSo what is all this fuss about fingerprints anyway...?\nPhoenix:\nMr. Atmey... Do you recall the events of yesterday?\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Come on! Open it up!\nPhoenix:\nHey! Wait a minute! We can't just open his private property!\nMaya:\nDon't be such a fuddy-duddy! This is an important investigation! Well? What's in there?\nPhoenix:\nH-Hang on a sec. I'm taking it out now... (Whatever it is, it feels... kinda hard... and smooth...)\nAtmey:\n...Well, hello there!!\nPhoenix:\nIt's true that I didn't get a chance to look in the bag at that time. But! I did touch what was inside.\nAtmey:\nWh-What!? Y-You touched it...?\nPhoenix:\nAnd I remember it very well. It was \"smooth and hard\".\nAtmey:\nW-Well, err... Th-That was just...\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! I'd like the court to examine the fingerprints on that urn. If my fingerprints are on there... Then it proves that the urn was in Detective Atmey's office!\nGodot:\nGodot:\nWell, even if your fingerprints are on the urn... ...it still doesn't prove when they were put there, does it?\nPhoenix:\nOf course it does.\nGodot:\nWh-What did you just say!?\nPhoenix:\nIt's not what I say, it's what Adrian Andrews, the person in charge of the exhibition said. (Changed from [Not what I said, it's what Adrian Andrews, the person in charge of the exhibition said.] in the original release)\nAndrews:\nI polished it until it was just about glowing... I thought maybe I could make it looks more valuable!\nPhoenix:\nIf she polished it that much, she must have removed any and all fingerprints on it. And the only chance I had to get my fingerprints on it after that was... Yesterday! At the Atmey Detective Agency!\nGodot:\nHa...! This blend... Godot Blend #107... I've decided... It's a little too bitter after all!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order! I accept the defense's request! Bailiff! Take this urn and...\nAtmey:\nWait! Wait a moment, Your Honor! ...There's no need for that.\nJudge:\nN-No need you say...?\nAtmey:\nPrecisely... I already know Mr. Wright's fingerprints are on the urn...\nJudge:\nWh-What are you saying!\nPhoenix:\n(Yes! I've finally broken him down!)\nAtmey:\nHee hee hee ha ha ha Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ho ho ho hee hee! Take a good look, everyone! Unable to find a rival worthy of my genius, I was forced to create one by myself! Here I am! The tragic clown...\nMaya:\nThis guy is nuttier than a fruitcake...\nAtmey:\nYou see! It was me all along! I am the one and only Mask☆DeMasque! Ha ha! I hope you all enjoyed my little performance! Hee hee hee ha ha ha Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ho ho ho hee hee hee!\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Godot... What's Mr. Atmey's condition?\nGodot:\nHe's still in the lobby, laughing insanely, Your Honor. I wish I could enjoy the joke as much as he seems to be.\nJudge:\nWell, it looks like the matter has been settled. I came perilously close to besmirching the record of an innocent young man. Besmirching him with the title of \"thief\"!\nMaya:\nNick, you were right after all!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah! I guess Mr. DeLite really wasn't the thief!)\nJudge:\nThe court finds the defendant, Mr. Ron DeLite...\n???:\nRon:\nYou're wrong! Wrong I tell you! Err, umm, I mean... Not exactly wrong so much, but actually not right is what I really trying to say\nPhoenix:\n(Oh no... He's not... This can't be happening...)\nRon:\nThe thief... The sneaky, odious thief who's been stealing all the treasures... It's me! I'm him! I'm the one you want! I'm the thief I tell you! So do it...! Pronounce me guilty! Pleeeease!!\nPhoenix:\n...\nGodot:\n...\n............\nJudge:\nI don't know what kind of a kangaroo court you all think this is, but...\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThe true identity of the thief has already been proven! Please hurry and pass judg--\nRon:\nWhat are you talking about!? I already confessed! I'm the thief I tell you!\nJudge:\n...Mr. Godot! Don't just stand there drinking coffee!\nGodot:\nHa...! Hey there, Mr. Thief...\nRon:\nY-Yes! Yes, sir!?\nGodot:\nIf you're really a man, then clean up your own mess.\nRon:\nI-I'm sorry... I'm afraid I just don't have any idea what do you mean.\nGodot:\nIf you are Mask☆DeMasque... then prove it. That's what it means.\nRon:\nY-Yes, sir! I'll be happy to!\nMaya:\nHe says he'll be happy to, Nick...\nPhoenix:\nIt's kinda cute... He's 100% committed to his fantasy.\nGodot:\nGood boy! Just remember one thing. A boy only gets one chance in his life to become a man!\nRon:\nI-I know that! I-I won't fail! I swear!\nGodot:\nOK, then... Talk! ...We're all listening.\nJudge:\nOh well... Let's all have a listen to this \"confession\"...\nWitness Testimony\n-- Mask☆DeMasque's Identity --\nRon:\nThe truth is, I've been Mask☆DeMasque all along!\nI mean, you can't prove that I'm not actually Mask☆DeMasque, can you?\nI don't have an alibi for the night the urn was stolen, after all!\nI donned my costume that night and dancingly descended upon the scene of the crime!\nLook! You can see right there in the photo! That's me!\nAs for my broach, I snagged it on the door handle and it got torn off, that's all!\nJudge:\nHmm... I don't like the direction this trial has taken...\nPhoenix:\n(But this is how every trial goes... At least with me, anyway...)\nGodot:\nHa...! You're doing great!\nRon:\nHee hee hee... Stop it, Mr. Godot... You're embarrassing me.\nGodot:\nLike I said, you're only going to get one chance to testify, alright? But if you make it through this with flying colors, I'll keep my promise, too. I'll make sure you stay locked up in prison as the one and only true Mask☆DeMasque!\nRon:\nThanks so much, Mr. Godot! I... I'll do my best!\nJudge:\nAlright, Mr. Wright. I'm afraid it's time for the cross-examination.\nPhoenix:\n*sigh*\nCross Examination\n-- Mask☆DeMasque's Identity --\nRon:\nThe truth is, I've been Mask☆DeMasque all along!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou may think you're real Mask☆DeMasque... but your wife thinks you're delusional.\nRon:\nI haven't told Dessie yet... About my true identity, I mean... Believe me, I've got my reasons.\nPhoenix:\n(With the way your room is decked out, how could she NOT know about it...?)\nJudge:\nHmm... Even thieves have complicated family situations, I suppose.\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? It sounds like we're about to get sidetracked... again.)\nPress harder\nPhoenix:\nSo why are you withholding the truth from your wife?\nRon:\nWell... first of all, I don't think she'd believe me anyway... And second... If there's one thing that Dessie absolutely detests... ...it's criminals.\nJudge:\nIf that's the case, then why did you ever start thieving to begin with?\nRon:\nWell, Dessie is crazy about shopping. She's a real shopaholic... But she's the love of my life, Your Honor. I guess you could say I'm a \"Dessie-aholic\"...\nJudge:\nHmm... So you do have a complicated family situation after all.\nPhoenix:\n...Alright, that's enough. Please continue with your testimony. I beg of you.\nLeads back to cross-examination\nLeave it\nPhoenix:\n(There's no point in digging through any more of their dirty laundry...) Well, why don't you continue with your testimony for now.\nLeads back to cross-examination\nRon:\nI mean, you can't prove that I'm not actually Mask☆DeMasque, can you?\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nUmm... I thought you were going to be the one to show US the proof. You know, that you're the real Mask☆DeMasque and not just some kind of obsessed fanboy.\nRon:\nHey now, that's not fair. Why do I have to do all the hard work anywaaaaay!?\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe because you're the one making the outrageous claim... for a change.)\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! You know that Mr. DeLite couldn't have committed the crime! You're the one with the fancy law degree! It's time to put it to work already!\nPhoenix:\nI need some kind of proof that Ron couldn't possibly be Mask☆DeMasque...\nMaya:\nWell, I guess if you had that kind of proof, we wouldn't still be here, would we...?\nPhoenix:\n(For the time being, maybe I need to shift strategy... I should try to show that Mr. DeLite couldn't have stolen the urn.)\nRon:\nAnyway, I...\nPresent Ron's Wallet or Key Card\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. DeLite. This wallet belongs to you, correct?\"\nRon:\nI don't have an alibi for the night the urn was stolen, after all!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou've got no alibi...?\nJudge:\nI've been a judge for a long time... And this is the first time I've ever heard a defendant brag about having no alibi.\nRon:\nBut I tell you I was in Lordly Tailor that night! ...Errr, no. That's too vague, even for me. To be more precise, I was down in the basement warehouse.\nPhoenix:\n(Hold on...)\nMaya:\nWhat is it, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nWhere was Ron DeLite when the crime happened anyway...? If we can prove he had an alibi after all, this case will be a piece of cake.\nMaya:\nW-Well, you're right, but...\nGodot:\nHa...! You think you can prove that? Wake up and smell the coffee!\nPhoenix:\nW-Well, I think maybe I can...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, do you have any evidence that shows the defendant has an alibi?\nNo, I have no evidence.\nPhoenix:\nOf course not! Don't be ridiculous!\nJudge:\nI-I'm sorry! ...Say! What am I apologizing for!? You! Witness! Hurry up with your testimony already!\nRon:\nI-I'm sorry! ...Why is it that I'm always the one that has to apologize to everyone in the end.\nLeads back to cross-examination\nYes, I have evidence.\nPhoenix:\nI have the evidence! Or do you think I'm still some sort of third-rate rookie!?\nJudge:\nOh...! I-I've never seen you this angry before!\nGodot:\n...I'm not surprised. Anger is the last refuge of the pathetic.\nPhoenix:\n(I thought I was more confident than angry...)\nJudge:\nWell then, let's see this evidence already. Show to this court evidence that proves where your client was on the night of the crime!\nPresent Ron's Wallet or Key Card\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. DeLite. This wallet belongs to you, correct?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHere's the evidence!\nGodot:\nHa...! It looks like I was right. ...Mr. Trite. The more pathetic a man is, the more likely he is to start pointing fingers!\nPhoenix:\nFor some reason, the good Prosecutor really wants to prove that I'm \"pathetic\"...\nJudge:\nThat's because you are pathetic! And so is your \"evidence\"!\nPhoenix:\n(Oops. I guess I was wrong... Again.)\nRon:\nAha! I told you I didn't have an alibi!\nLeads back to cross-examination\nPresent Ron's Wallet or Key Card\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. DeLite. This wallet belongs to you, correct?\"\nRon:\nI donned my costume that night and dancingly descended upon the scene of the crime!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\n\"Dancingly descended\"...? From where exactly?\nRon:\nWell... From the entrance, I suppose. Where else?\nPhoenix:\n(So in actuality, he neither \"danced\" nor \"descended\"! ...Someone save me. Again.)\nMaya:\nI guess he thinks \"descended\" sounds more heroic or thief-like or something.\nRon:\nA-Anyway! I was there at the crime scene! Just like I said!\nRon:\nLook! You can see right there in the photo! That's me!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThis is the photo that was taken by the security camera at the crime scene...\nJudge:\nNo doubt about it. That's Mask☆DeMasque.\nPhoenix:\nYes, but don't forget there's something important missing. The real Mask☆DeMasque has a big broach on his chest!\nRon:\nAs for my broach, I snagged it on the door handle and it got torn off, that's all!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou didn't notice it when your broach was torn off?\nRon:\nHuh!? W-Well... I'm always a little nervous when I'm working.\nPhoenix:\n(There's a bit of clothing left on the back side of the broach. I don't think it could have been torn off that easily...)\nMaya:\nYes, but... I don't see what that has to do with anything. Right now we're trying to prove that Mr. DeLite isn't the thief, right?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I guess so. (Let me hear that testimony one more time.)\nMaya:\nWhy does Mr. DeLite want to be Mask☆DeMasque so badly anyway? It's kinda disturbing. He doesn't seem like your typical attention whore to me. Unlike, say... you, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nI am nothing of the sort, thank you very much. (But I gotta admit it is kinda scary the way Ron acts...)\nMaya:\nAnyway... Time to poke some holes in that testimony of his!\nPhoenix:\nMr. DeLite. This wallet belongs to you, correct?\nRon:\nAh! Y-Yes. It-It does. I-I had lost it somewhere!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! When you find a wallet, you should report it to the police right away!\nPhoenix:\nAh! No! You don't understand. This is an important piece of evidence.\nJudge:\n\"Evidence\"...?\nPhoenix:\nMr. DeLite... When did you first notice that you'd lost your wallet?\nRon:\nErr, let's see... I think it was on the night of the crime... But I know I still had it when Dessie and I went out for dinner.\nPhoenix:\nThis wallet was found at approximately 1:00 AM at KB Security headquarters.\nJudge:\nWhat...!? Surely you're not serious!?\nPhoenix:\nYes... I am serious. This proves that Mr. DeLite was, in fact, at KB Security that night!\nRon:\nNoooooo!\nPhoenix:\nSo if the defendant was at KB Security at 1 o'clock in the morning... ...then that proves that he has a watertight alibi!\nRon:\nNoooooo!\nPhoenix:\nFurthermore, considering the distance between Lordly Tailor and KB Security... ...it would have taken 30 minutes to get there by car! (According to Larry anyway...)\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Godot!? Do you have anything to say? And stop drinking that coffee!\nGodot:\n...Come on, Mr. Thief. Don't let this guy beat you! Tell him why he's wrong!\nRon:\nYou're the only one who calls me \"thief\", Mr. Godot... ...Alright, I'll try! I-I'll do it! I will!\nMaya:\n...He's really got Mr. DeLite all worked up...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, he's like a kid at his first day of school...\nRon:\nLook, it's just ridiculous! Why would I have dropped my wallet at KB Security!? Someone must have planted it there to make it LOOK like I was there and not at the heist.\nMaya:\n\"Planted it there\"? He's really reaching now...\nPhoenix:\nMr. DeLite. You probably dropped your wallet when you took it out to use this, didn't you? The key card to KB Security's CEO's office.\nRon:\nNoooo!\nGodot:\nHa...! That was a pretty good try, Mr. Trite... Unfortunately, you've overlooked one small thing.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What...?\nGodot:\n\"Motive\" of course! Why would this thief go to KB Security in the middle of the night anyway!?\nJudge:\nHmm... Well, Mr. Wright? It looks like you need some more evidence after all.\nPhoenix:\n(Grrr! This stupid kid...!)\nJudge:\nNow then. Let's see your evidence. The evidence that shows why Mr. DeLite went to KB Security at 1 AM that night!\nPresent Blackmail Letter\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. DeLite... I believe you've seen this before, correct?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHere is your evidence!\nRon:\n...What is this supposed to mean, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? Well, um... Don't you know?\nRon:\nMr. Wright... If you're a real man, you should clean up your own mess.\nPhoenix:\nDoh...! (For some reason, it bothers me more when HE says it!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Now then. Let's see your evidence.\"\nPhoenix:\nMr. DeLite... I believe you've seen this before, correct?\nRon:\nAh...! Th-That's...!\nJudge:\nWhat is it?\nPhoenix:\nA blackmail letter. That's what it looks like from the contents.\nGodot:\nB-Blackmail...?\nPhoenix:\nYes, basically it says, \"bring $50,000 dollars\". [sic]\nJudge:\nHmm... That certainly sounds like blackmail alright...\nPhoenix:\nAt the time of the theft, Mr. DeLite was dealing with the blackmailer himself... ...in KB Security's CEO office, a full half an hour away from the scene of the crime!\nGodot:\n...Ungh... Urk... No No No No No NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! OOOOORDER!! So when the theft of the urn occurred, the defendant was at KB Security... It looks like a perfect case for the defense!\nGodot:\nGodot:\n...You may see it as a perfect case, Judge, but to me... Well, let's just say that my Godot Blend #107 impresses me a lot more.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What are you trying to say?\nGodot:\nYou say the thief was being blackmailed by the CEO of a security company... But... Did you actually investigate this CEO at all?\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? Well, umm... No... I guess not.\nGodot:\nAccusing a man of blackmail with no proof? I'm not sure what I think of that...\nPhoenix:\n(\"Not sure what I think of that\"...? At least I know what I think of you...)\nJudge:\nHmm... Good point. I'm not sure what I think of it myself... You claim that the defendant entered the CEO's office... ...but you will need at least one witness to corroborate your claim, Mr. Wright.\nMaya:\nNick! I think we're going to have to track down the CEO guy...\nPhoenix:\nNo, we don't have to track down the CEO at all.\nGodot:\nWhat do you mean by that, Mr. Trite?\nPhoenix:\nThere is someone else who can testify. This is the person who can testify that the key card was used at 1 AM that night!\nPresent Larry Butz profile\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Wh-Who is this useless-looking young man?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nGodot:\nHa...! That's the first time one of your jokes actually made me truly laugh.\nPhoenix:\n(Umm, I haven't actually made any jokes... Not intentionally anyway...)\nJudge:\nWell, perhaps you find it funny, but I fail to see any humor in it!\nPhoenix:\n(The problem is the key card that was in Ron's wallet... Somehow I need to prove that the card was used at 1 o'clock in the morning.)\nLeads back to:\n\"There is someone else who can testify.\"\nJudge:\nWh-Who is this useless-looking young man?\nPhoenix:\nYou don't remember him, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nHmmmm... Not exactly... But just looking at his picture makes the bile start to rise in my throat.\nMaya:\nIt looks like he doesn't remember the case from 2 years ago...\nPhoenix:\nHe probably blocked out that memory on purpose. Anyway, this man was working as a guard at KB Security that night.\nGodot:\nOh...?\nPhoenix:\nThe question at hand is this key card.\nButz:\nYup. That's the key card they use at the building I work in. According to the serial number, this one is for the CEO's office. You need it to get into that room, and every time you use that card, it leaves a record.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\nAs you can see, there's no need to investigate the CEO of KB Security! We should be able to discover the truth simply by analyzing this key card's data!\nGodot:\nBwaaaah...!\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Godot?\nGodot:\nThe name of the CEO of KB Security is Kane Bullard. I was unable to contact him directly, but... I got the key card data. ...Here.\nJudge:\nS-So what does it show!?\nGodot:\nEach key card has its own serial number and they leave detailed records of their use. According to this data... this card was used at 1 AM on the morning of the crime.\nKey Card updated in the Court Record.\nJudge:\nBut that means... it can't be Mr. DeLite dressed as Mask☆DeMasque in this photo!\nGodot:\nHa...! It looks like you're right. Two minutes isn't even enough time to brew a good cup o' Joe...\nPhoenix:\nSo... So then...!\nGodot:\nRon DeLite was clearly in the office of KB Security's CEO at the time of the crime. ...The prosecutor's office is ready to admit that fact. Therefore, it's impossible for the defendant to be Mask☆DeMasque.\nMaya:\nGood job! You did it, Nick!\nJudge:\n...That's enough! I came perilously close to besmirching the record of an innocent young man. Besmirching him with the title of \"thief\"! ...\nPhoenix:\nWh-What's wrong, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nI'm ready to pass judgement... But before I do that, do you have any further objections?\nPhoenix:\nNo, Your Honor!\nGodot:\nHrpmh...!\nRon:\nUnnnggh...\nJudge:\n...Very well. The court finds the defendant, Mr. Ron DeLite...\nNot Guilty\nJudge:\nCourt is now adjourned!

I'm a little bit ashamed of myself.\nDesirée:\nNicky boy!\nPhoenix:\nOh! Ms. DeLite...!\nDesirée:\nI knew you could do it! I believed in you all along, Nicky boy! ...I don't know how I can ever repay you.\nPhoenix:\nAww... Shucks... Thanks, Ms. DeLite. (I just know I'm blushing...)\nPearl:\nCongratulations, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nOh! P-Pearls...! (I've got a bad feeling about this...)\nPearl:\n*gasp!* Wh-Who is this woman!\nPhoenix:\nOh, she... She's nobody... She's just ahh...\nPearl:\nYou're blushing! How dare you do this in front of Mystic Maya! You should be ashamed of yourself!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeowch! She slapped me...)\nMaya:\nUmm, Pearly... This woman is Ms. Desirée DeLite. She's our client's wife.\nPearl:\n*gasp!* Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes!?\nPearl:\nYou're even worse than I thought! Going behind the back of your own client...!\nPhoenix:\nN-N-No! You've got it all wrong!\nPearl:\nI'll never forgive you!\nPhoenix:\n(Owww... A double slap...)\nMaya:\nWell, anyway, All's well that ends well, right? We got the Sacred Urn back and the thief has been caught!\nDesirée:\nYou're so right! And it's all thanks to Nicky boy here!\nMaya:\nBut actually it was you, Ms. DeLite, that brought us our urn back! Thank you from the bottom of my heart!\nDesirée:\nOh, please... You're embarrassing me!\nPhoenix:\n(If we won the case... ...then why does this guy still look so glum...?)\nRon:\nUgggh... But I am the thief... Actually, what's the point now\nDesirée:\n...What is it, honey? I did my best for you, Ronnie!\nRon:\nI-I know that and I appreciate it, Dessie... But the thing is...\nGodot:\nCome on... Give the kid some time. He's just got a little touch of the blues. You know about feeling blue, right, amigo?\nPhoenix:\nM-Mr. Godot! What are you doing here!?\nGodot:\nOh come on! I just came here to say thanks to my newest buddy... ...You, Mr. Trite.\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe you should learn my name before you call me \"buddy\"...)\nGodot:\nWell, playtime is over.\nPhoenix:\nHuh...?\nGodot:\nEarly this morning... the body of Kane Bullard was discovered.\nMaya:\nKane Bullard...? Where have I heard that name before?\nDesirée:\nIsn't that... the name of the CEO of KB Security?\nMaya:\nWait. B-Body...!? (Changed from [B-Body...?] in the original release)\nGodot:\nThe estimated time of death was 1 AM on October 12th.\nPhoenix:\n1 AM on October 12th...? Y-You don't mean!?\nGodot:\n...That's right, amigo. At the same time that a cheap little urn was being stolen... ...the CEO of KB Security was being murdered.\nPhoenix:\nS-So then... What are you doing here?\nGodot:\nOh come on. You've figured it out already, haven't you amigo? Or... Have you already forgotten about that piece of info I helped you out with today?\nPhoenix:\n(\"Helped me out\"? What!?)\nGodot:\nOn October 12th, at 1 o'clock in the morning... Ron DeLite was in the CEO's office... ...The scene of the murder. After getting that blackmail letter, he must have been imbrued with utter rage.\nMaya:\nWh-What are you saying!? Imbrued with rage...?\nGodot:\nCome on! Don't tell me you didn't know! (Changed from [Come on! Don't tell me you didn't know it!] in the original release) Ron DeLite was once an employee of KB Security... He was a professional security guard.\nPhoenix:\n(An employee of KB Security!?)\nGodot:\nIt looks like the alibi that saved him from being convicted as a thief... ...is going to be the noose that gets him hanged. Kind of an \"anti-alibi\".\nMaya:\nNo way...\nGodot:\nHe can't be the thief because he was at the murder scene when the murder occurred!\nDesirée:\nN-No! Th-That's a lie! It can't be true!\nRon:\nOh! Ohhhh! B-But I... I am a thief I tell you!\nGodot:\nRon DeLite. You're going back to prison again. This time the charge is much more serious. This time you'll be tried for murder.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!? This can't... This is impossible!\nGodot:\nI'm looking forward to another exciting showdown, Mr. Trite!\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nYou and I aren't through with each other yet. Surely you won't back down from a challenge! You've never been a coward!\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Is there something personal between you two...?\nGodot:\nI've returned from the depths of Hell to do battle with you. ...At least let me have some fun while I'm here!\nPhoenix:\n(This guy... Who the heck is he!? He may be quiet... But he's the most dangerous enemy I've ever faced...)\nGodot:\nWell then... Time to say goodbye to Mr. DeLite.\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nN-Nick...! How could this be happening?\nPhoenix:\nRight in front of our every eyes, our client has been arrested for murder. And the one who established his presence at the scene... was me.\nDesirée:\nEEEEEYYYAAAAHHH! R-RONNNIEEEEEEEE!\nPhoenix:\n(Arrested for murder on the very same day he's declared innocent of larceny... What the heck's going to happen next!?)\nTo be continued.\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?\nJudge:\nUh... I'm not sure I follow you.\nPhoenix:\nIt clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...\nJudge:\nYou don't sound very sure, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!\nJudge:\n...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Really?\nJudge:\nObjection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThis evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nHow exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related?\nPhoenix:\nThey aren't, are they...\nJudge:\nNot at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThe witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!\nJudge:\n... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh, I must be on the wrong track...?)\nToo many penalties\nJudge:\nThat's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for mis-interpretation of the facts.

Is something wrong...?\nMaya:\nNah. But did you see all the people here? It's crazy! Oh! So, check out the Mask☆DeMasque glossy I bought! (Changed from [Oh! Look at this! I bought this Mask☆DeMasque publicity photo!] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nYou bought this... where? (Changed from [You bought that...? Where!?] in the original release)\nPearl:\nFrom the little tents in front of the courthouse. They have all sorts of things for sale!\nMaya:\nYou know I'm sucker for this kind of stuff!\nMask☆DeMasque Publicity Photo stuck into the Court Record.\nCome on! I'm guilty! Throw the book at meeee!\nPearl:\n...Who's screaming like that?\nRon:\n...Oh! Mr. Wright! You made it!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I did. But it doesn't look like things are going to get any less ugly for you...\nRon:\nBecause I did it!! I'm the criminal! Me! Me! Meeeeeee!\nMaya:\nUngh... He's at it again.\nRon:\nI sent the calling card to Lordly Tailor! I admit iiiit!!\nPhoenix:\nBut... You don't have the Sacred Urn, right?\nRon:\nWell, that's true, but... That doesn't mean that I didn't commit the crime.\nPhoenix:\n(Normally, when I say \"Of course you didn't\" I'm being sarcastic, but you... Yikes!)\nRon:\nAnyway, I admit that I'm guilty... So make sure they give me a guilty verdict! Pleeeeease!?\nDesirée:\nOh, there you are Ronnie! Bonjour, sweetie!\nRon:\nOh! D-Dessie honey! B-Bonjour! ...Well, actually... I don't really know why I should be speaking French to you at a time like this\nDesirée:\nLeave it all to me, Ronnie! I swear I'll protect you!\nRon:\nUmmm, errr... Aaah... Well, ahh... You see... Actually the thief is err, me\nDesirée:\nCan I tell you something, Nicky boy? I can guarantee that my Ronnie is innocent! If he's declared guilty, I'll be ever so cross with you!\nPhoenix:\n(So why are you smiling when you say it?)\nDesirée:\nWell, if you'll excuse me! I've got some errands I need to take care of! I'm counting on you, Nicky boy! Good luck!\nPhoenix:\n(To be honest, I really don't know whether Ron is Mask☆DeMasque or not. But there's only one thing I AM sure of. He doesn't have the Sacred Urn right now...)\nBailiff:\nMr. DeLite! It's time for you to enter the courtroom!\nPhoenix:\n(For the time being, I guess I'll have to trust Desirée...)\nOctober 13, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 6\nJudge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Ron DeLite.\nPhoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your honor.\n???:\n...\nJudge:\nWhat about the prosecution? Are you prepared to...\n???:\n...What a stupid question!\nJudge:\nWh-What did you say!\n???:\nFine. Let me ask you then, Your Honor. Are YOU ready? Are you ready to pass judgement?\nJudge:\nWh...! N-No, I... I'm not! I will pass judgement after I hear arguments from both sides.\n???:\nWell, if you're not ready yourself, you shouldn't expect others to be. That's a rule to live by.\nJudge:\n...Um, wh-who are you?\nGodot:\nI am Godot. Legendary prosecutor. I've never lost a case.\nMaya:\nAh! He's the one that Detective Atmey was talking about...\nJudge:\nYes, your reputation precedes you. What kind of cases have you dealt with so far?\nGodot:\nHa...! None.\nJudge:\nWhat did you say...?\nGodot:\nI've never prosecuted a case before.\nJudge:\nN-Never? But you said you've never lost before.\nGodot:\n...Exactly. I've never lost. I've never won before either.\nJudge:\nQuite arrogant for a beginner, aren't you?\nGodot:\nEven the mightiest of redwoods begin their lives as mere saplings.\nJudge:\nYes, but... A mask? In a court of law?\nGodot:\nHa...! Don't you know anything? No matter the man, we all wear masks... Either on our faces or ever our hearts.\nJudge:\n...!\nMaya:\nThis guy is the real deal alright, Nick...\nPhoenix:\n(Why does it seem like all prosecutors are the \"real deal\"...?)\nGodot:\nSo we finally meet... Mr. Phoenix Trite!\nPhoenix:\n...?\nMaya:\nN-Nick! Is he a friend of yours?\nPhoenix:\nNo. I don't have any friends that call me \"Trite\". (Just who is this masked man...?)\nGodot:\nI've returned from the depths of Hell... To do battle with you.\nJudge:\nWell then, err, Prosecutor Gobo.\nGodot:\nIt's not \"Gobo\". It's Godot... Your Honor.\nJudge:\nIn any case, please give your opening statement.\nGodot:\nOpening statement? Those things are not fit for even dogs to consume. I have only one thing to say before we start. To you... Mr. Trite.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What is it?\nGodot:\nAre you familiar with the saying, \"A chain is only as strong as its weakest link\"? I wonder... how much you can withstand before you and your case break in two...?\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\nHmm... Well then, let's hear from the first witness!\nGumshoe:\nUm, my name is...\nGodot:\nNo one asked for your name, witness.\nGumshoe:\n...Urk.\nGodot:\nThe important thing is what you know... That's all. Start talking. ...We're listening.\nGumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir.\nJudge:\nAlright, witness. First, let's hear about... What you know about the thief that stole the urn.\nGumshoe:\nYes, sir!\nWitness Testimony\n-- Mask☆DeMasque's Crimes --\nGumshoe:\nMask☆DeMasque is a master thief that first started his crime spree 6 months ago.\nHe's so confident that he sends his calling card before he even commits the crime!\nThis was his fifth heist, and as usual, he sent a card on to Lordly Tailor.\nHis pattern is to always go after only the most precious art pieces.\nThat's why we're sure it was Mask☆DeMasque, sir. It fits his M. O. to a T!\nJudge:\nHmm... So then the actual identity of this Mask☆DeMasque is... M-Mr. Godot! W-What are you--!? (Changed from [M-Mr. Godot! Y-You!] in the original release) W-We're in the middle of a trial here, Mr. Godot!\nGodot:\nBlacker than a moonless night, hotter and more bitter than Hell itself... That is coffee. I'm sure you can grant me at least this much... Your Honor. Oh, please. Proceed.\nJudge:\n... Very well. It's only coffee, after all.\nPhoenix:\n(What!? You can't be letting him slide this early in the trial!)\nJudge:\nProceed with your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.\nMaya:\nWell, Nick? What are you going to do?\nPhoenix:\nAs long as they haven't brought up Mr. DeLite's identity... ...all we can do is show that it wasn't Mask☆DeMasque who stole the urn.\nCross Examination\n-- Mask☆DeMasque's Crimes --\nGumshoe:\nMask☆DeMasque is a master thief that first started his crime spree 6 months ago.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHave you been involved in the investigation from the beginning?\nGumshoe:\nYup! Nobody knows more about the thief than me, pal! It's true! I'm a... Zvarri...! \"Author on thieves\"!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nAn \"author\"...? He's written books about thieves?\nPhoenix:\nUm, I think he probably meant to say \"authority\".\nGumshoe:\nThe fact that this guy can slip through even my fingers shows how good he is, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(It's easy when those fingers happen to be \"butter fingers\"...)\nPress harder\nPhoenix:\nSo nobody knows more about the thief than you, huh...?\nGumshoe:\nYou got it, pal! Except maybe for the thief's mom, that is!\nPhoenix:\nBut isn't there someone who knows even more about him than the police?\nGumshoe:\nYou don't mean... \"Detective Zvarri\", do you?\nJudge:\nHmm... Who is this person? Zvarri? He sounds German...\nGumshoe:\nHis name is Luke Atmey, sir. I guess I shouldn't have made up such a silly name for him.\nPhoenix:\n(What the heck? I guess he's not all that famous after all...)\nGumshoe:\nAnyway, it's true that he did manage to retrieve the last item the thief stole.\nJudge:\n...Oh, I see. It seems you're not the expert you claim to be.\nGumshoe:\n...Urk! I-It looks like the thief is playing with me, even now!\nLeads back to cross-examination\nLeave it\nPhoenix:\n(The real \"authority\" on the thief is the other detective. I don't need to ask this one any more questions...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nGumshoe:\nHe's so confident that he sends his calling card before he even commits the crime!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHave you seen all of these so-called \"calling cards\"?\nGumshoe:\nOf course I have. Except... The person in charge of the Treasure Exhibit never brought their card to the police... So I didn't see this one until after the crime occurred.\nMaya:\nThat's because Detective Atmey stopped Ms. Andrews from taking it to the police.\nJudge:\nWas the calling card that Lordly Tailor received authentic?\nGumshoe:\nWell, all the cards have one common, identifying feature. But we're not releasing that information to the general public...\nJudge:\nBut you're absolutely certain that this card is real?\nPhoenix:\n(Gumshoe can't say it out loud but I bet he's talking about Mask☆DeMasque's emblem...)\nGumshoe:\nThis was his fifth heist, and as usual, he sent a card on to Lordly Tailor.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHis fifth heist... And your fifth screw up, huh?\nGumshoe:\nObjection, pal! That ain't fair! Maybe you could say I screwed up four times! But this last time wasn't my fault! I didn't know about the calling card this time!\nPhoenix:\n(You of all people shouldn't be chuckling about this, Detective Gumshoe...)\nGumshoe:\nI just want everyone here in the courtroom to know something! If you ever get a calling card from this guy, don't call some stupid private eye! Call your local police right away. Got me?\nMaya:\nWow, it looks like he's really got it in for Detective Atmey.\nGumshoe:\nHis pattern is to always go after only the most precious art pieces.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nArt pieces? Like what, for example?\nGumshoe:\nWell, his first target was the famous \"Tear of Emanon\".\nJudge:\nWhat's that? Some kind of especially salty teardrop?\nGumshoe:\nN-No, sir. It's a blue diamond. A single, rare diamond. Next was the \"Crown of Bongora\"... You know, the thing you put on your head. After that was the \"Left Hand of Hades\" and then the \"Portrait of Mejeena\", sir. Detective Atmey retrieved the \"Portrait of Mejeena\" and returned it to the museum.\nPhoenix:\nAnd the target of his fifth and last robbery was the \"Sacred Urn\"... right?\nJudge:\nBut isn't it difficult for him to dispose of such famous art pieces...?\nGumshoe:\nWell, we assume he must have some underworld connections.\nMaya:\nSomehow, Mr. DeLite doesn't look the type...\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, he's a little too sunny to be hanging out in the underworld...)\nPresent Sacred Urn\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"...Can I ask you a little something, Detective Gumshoe?\"\nGumshoe:\nThat's why we're sure it was Mask☆DeMasque, sir. It fits his M. O. to a T!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean when you say, \"it fits his M. O. to a T\"?\nJudge:\nI was thinking of asking the same thing myself.\nGumshoe:\nUgh... I wish you would listen a little more closely, pal. First of all, there's the calling card. We're 100% certain it's authentic. Then there's the fact that he seemed to know all about the security system. And finally, his target was an art piece. These are all part of the thief's modus operandi.\nJudge:\nAnd so, since this robbery seems to fit all those conditions...?\nGumshoe:\nThat's right! It means that Mask☆DeMasque is behind it!\nPresent Sacred Urn\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"...Can I ask you a little something, Detective Gumshoe?\"\nMaya:\nNick! It definitely looks like it was Mask☆DeMasque who stole the urn!\nPhoenix:\nBut there's no real evidence either way as to whether Ron DeLite is Mask☆DeMasque.\nMaya:\nBut... But...\nPhoenix:\nAlso, the urn hasn't turned up yet, let alone in connection to Mr. DeLite himself.\nMaya:\nSo even though we know it was Mask☆DeMasque that did it...\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe for the time being, I should try to show it wasn't Mask☆DeMasque that did it!)\nPhoenix:\n...Can I ask you a little something, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\n...Just hearing the \"little\" in that question is making me nervous.\nPhoenix:\nYou said that he always \"goes after the most precious art pieces\", right?\nGumshoe:\nThat's right, pal.\nPhoenix:\nBut there's one problem... That's not what he did in this case. The supposedly \"priceless\" urn doesn't exactly rise to the level of \"precious art\"!\nGumshoe:\nWh-What do you mean!?\nMaya:\nN-Nick! How can you say such a terrible thing!?\nPhoenix:\nNo! I meant from a financial point of view! I mean, it wouldn't fetch a good price.\nJudge:\nWell, Prosecutor Godot? What is the value of that urn?\nGodot:\nThe appraisers I spoke to said they couldn't attach a price to it. And I mean that in the worst sense.\nPhoenix:\nSo in other words... It was not the kind of item that Mask☆DeMasque would normally go after!\nGumshoe:\nUrk!\nJudge:\nHmm... If I understand you correctly, Mr. Wright... ...you're saying that the theft of the Sacred Urn was not the work of Mask☆DeMasque...!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes... That's what I'm saying. (Actually all I did was point out the contradiction. The argument made itself, but...)\nJudge:\nWell... First of all, we need to get this issue cleared up. Was this last robbery the work of Mask☆DeMasque or not? What do you have to say about this, Mr. Godot?\nGodot:\nThis coffee here... It's my own special blend. I call it Godot #107. I'm trying to decide whether to cut down on the acidity or the bitterness... That's the only thing I've got on my mind right now... ...Mr. Trite!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!?\nGodot:\nIf you're really a man, you should clean up your own mess.\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Sorry, but I didn't get what you mean.\nGodot:\nIf you're saying it wasn't Mask☆DeMasque that stole the urn... ...then it must be someone imitating Mask☆DeMasque's methods... A fake.\nJudge:\nA-A Fake☆DeMasque?\nMaya:\nFake☆DeMasque? That sounds so ridiculous. ...But I like it.\nGodot:\nNow, before I decide on my coffee, I believe some proof is in order, Mr. Trite. Proof that the person who appeared at Lordly Tailor that night was actually a fake.\nJudge:\nHmm... Though I don't approve of Mr. Godot's behavior, his point is valid. Mr. Wright. ...We're waiting.\nPhoenix:\n(It looks like I'm going to have to prove it... I need proof that the person at Lordly Tailor that night was in fact, Fake☆DeMasque!)\nPresent Security Camera Photo\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"The proof is right here.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nJudge:\nWhat is this evidence supposed to prove?\nGodot:\nHa...! Well, it proves someone here is a fake alright. ...It proves that this lawyer is a fake.\nPhoenix:\n(These prosecutors sure know how to twist the knife...)\nMaya:\nThis is no time to be impressed! Think it over again! When he stole the urn, his photo was taken, right? Who knows? Maybe there's something on there that shows he's a fake...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Is she talking about that photo we got from Atmey?)\nJudge:\nAre you ready yet, Mr. Wright?\nLeads back to:\n\"It looks like I'm going to have to prove it...\"\nPhoenix:\nThe proof is right here.\nJudge:\nThis looks like... a photo taken by a security camera.\nPhoenix:\nBut if you look closely... you'll notice something peculiar about it.\nGodot:\nHa...! Well then, why don't you go ahead and show us what it is. Go on. Use this pointer and show us just what about this picture is so \"peculiar\".\nPresent front of Mask☆DeMasque's neck\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"It's right here, of course!\"\nPresent anywhere else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nIt's right here. ...I think.\nJudge:\nIs that what was so \"peculiar\"?\nGodot:\nHa...! The place that you're pointing to is all wrong.\nPhoenix:\nWh... What do you mean!\nGodot:\nThe only thing \"peculiar\" in this courtroom... is on top of your head.\nMaya:\nNick! Are you going to let him get away making fun of your hair!?\nPhoenix:\n(Yes... At least until I know he can't use his goggles to fry me or something...) W-Well anyway! There is a strange spot in this photo!\nGodot:\nHa...! Still haven't given up? So what is it then?\nLeads back to:\n\"Go on. Use this pointer and show us just what about this picture is so \"peculiar\".\"\nPhoenix:\nIt's right here, of course!\nJudge:\nYou mean... Mask☆DeMasque?\nPhoenix:\nI have here a piece of reference I would like the court to take a look at.\nMaya:\nIsn't that the publicity photo I bought this morning...?\nPhoenix:\nThe problem I have with the security camera photo is the broach on DeMasque's chest.\nJudge:\nA Breach? Here!? Bailiff! Get my steed! We need to retreat at once!\nPhoenix:\n...A broach, Your Honor. It's a sort of clasp for holding one's cape on.\nJudge:\nA clasp, eh... Ah! I see now!\nGumshoe:\nBut the Mask☆DeMasque in the security camera photo... Ahh!! He has no broach!!\nPhoenix:\nThat broach is the same as the emblem on DeMasque's calling card and serves as his symbol. But the thief that broke into Lordly Tailor wasn't wearing a broach... In other words, this \"Mask☆DeMasque\" is a fake!\nGumshoe:\n...! I-I've been fooled agaaaaaain!\nJudge:\nO-Order! It's true... Undeniably true... Detective Gumshoe! How... How could you have overlooked this!?\nGumshoe:\nI-I'm sorry, sir! I don't know how I...\nGodot:\nHey now... ...If you're gonna have a pity party, invite me, too!\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Godot! You deserve some blame in this, too! How could you have overlooked such a large broach...?\nGodot:\nHa...! The broach you're talking about... Do you mean this?\nGumshoe:\nAh...!\nPhoenix:\nTh-That's...! Mask☆DeMasque's broach!\nJudge:\nWh-Where did you find it!?\nGodot:\nWell I've always had a good nose for evidence... I got it at the crime scene. It was hidden in the shadow of a big female Buddha statue.\nPhoenix:\n(\"Buddha statue\"...? He must mean the Ami Fey statue.)\nGumshoe:\nWh-Why didn't you tell me about that, sir!?\nGodot:\n...I always put evidence away in my pocket. ...After all, it's the safest place for crucial evidence.\nMaya:\nGrrr... This guy is one cool customer.\nGodot:\nIt's a little early to be shaken up, isn't it, little lady? ...That friend of yours left pretty little hickeys on there, too.\nJudge:\nH-Hickeys?\nGodot:\nFiguratively speaking, of course... I'm referring to Ron DeLite's fingerprints.\nGumshoe:\nWhaaa...?\nJudge:\nWhat!? The defendant's fingerprints are on the broach!? Order! Order in the court! Mr. Godot! Let's see that broach!\nGodot:\nI've grown attached to my metallic girlfriend here. ...Take good care of her.\nJudge:\nHmm... She-- I mean, it appears to have been torn off some clothing. There's a little bit of cloth left on the back.\nGodot:\nObviously there must have been a big struggle that night at the crime scene.\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh... Phoenix, we have a problem...)\nDeMasque's Broach added to the Court Record.\nGodot:\nHa...! You mess with Godot... ...and you get burned.\nPhoenix:\n(Grr... He's been playing me like a violin...)\nGodot:\nWell Judge, I'm about ready to call my next witness.\nGumshoe:\nHuh? You're done with me? But I haven't proved anything yet.\nGodot:\nYou've proven your own incompetence. That's good enough.\nGumshoe:\n...That doesn't sound good at all.\nJudge:\nBailiff! Bring the next witness into the courtroom!\nPhoenix:\n(Finally time for the Ace Detective to make his appearance, huh...?)\nGodot:\nOne second is one drip of the coffee pot. Let's hurry it up.\nAtmey:\nSHHH! SILENCE!... Hee hee hee hee hee... Now I see. It's all becoming clear.\nJudge:\nWh-What's clear?\nAtmey:\n...Zvarri! The truth has once again been elegantly revealed to me! What we have here is... A judge and a prosecutor. ...A coffee maniac, at that! ...Am I correct?\nJudge:\nW-Well, yes. That's right.\nGodot:\nHa...! Not bad. Not bad at all. You're the first person that's ever been able to penetrate my secret veil.\nAtmey:\nWell, Sir Prosecutor. Let me introduce myself. My name is Luke Atmey, Ace Detective and rising star illuminating the heavens.\nMaya:\nBoy, these two make a perfect pair...\nPhoenix:\nThey'd either be best friends or they'd tear each other's heads off.\nJudge:\nI've heard that on the night of the crime, you were all alone on security detail.\nAtmey:\n...You have heard correctly. My specially-made monocle is worth more than a hundred Detective Gumshoes. ...If Detective Gumshoe was worth anything, that is.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\n(Why was this guy all by himself anyway...? There must be some reason. I'm sure of it!)\nJudge:\nWell then, tell us what this special monocle of yours witnessed!\nWitness Testimony\n-- What I Witnessed --\nAtmey:\nIt was approximately 1 o'clock in the morning... just after the date changed.\nThat's when my nemesis, the infamous Mask☆DeMasque, dancingly descended upon me!\nJust as I began to turn, the coward struck a fierce blow upon my noble head!\nDarkness swallowed me before I could land a single strike. When I awoke, he was gone.\nThirty minutes later, I used an emergency phone to notify the police!\nJudge:\nSo you didn't get a clear look at the criminal?\nAtmey:\nMy specially-made monocle never misses a thing. However! That is limited to things that fall within my own visual range! But of course, that's only natural.\nJudge:\n...I fall to see why the witness seems so proud of his performance that evening.\nAtmey:\nWell, Sir Old-Timer, let me explain. We are not speaking of any ordinary thief... ...but of the kings of thieves! The great Mask☆DeMasque, my arch-enemy! That is what my instincts and my years of experience tell me!\nJudge:\nHmm... Very well. Proceed with the cross-examination, Mr. Wright.\nCross Examination\n-- What I Witnessed --\nAtmey:\nIt was approximately 1 o'clock in the morning... just after the date changed.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo that would be one o'clock on the morning of the 12th, correct?\nAtmey:\nThat's an impressive deduction, Sir Lawyer.\nPhoenix:\nYou were on security duty that night. Where exactly were you at the time?\nAtmey:\nA penetrating question! I was in the basement warehouse, near the computer.\nPhoenix:\n(Near the computer, huh...)\nJudge:\nSo then you weren't trying to remain hidden, I take it?\nAtmey:\nUp to this point, I have tried to remain concealed while waiting for the thief...\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, he said the same thing yesterday, too.)\nMaya:\nGumshoe also said that he never saw him at the crime scene...\nAtmey:\nPrecisely! That is precisely why I chose NOT to hide last night. I knew that by NOT concealing myself, I would be putting pressure on the thief.\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like the thief was the one applying pressure... On your pidgeony head, that is.)\nAtmey:\nIn any case!\nAtmey:\nThat's when my nemesis, the infamous Mask☆DeMasque, dancingly descended upon me!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\n\"Dancingly descended\"...? From where exactly?\nAtmey:\nWell... From the entrance, I suppose. Where else?\nPhoenix:\n(So in actuality, he neither \"danced\" nor \"descended\"! ...Someone please save me.) Um... So how is it that you didn't notice the thief?\nAtmey:\nMy eyes were looking for the thief's shadow while my ears listened for his footfalls. But even so, the dastardly criminal managed to sneak up on me... It can only be due to his subtly camouflaged cape and soft-soled shoes.\nPhoenix:\n(... I hereby dub you \"Ace Dunce\".)\nAtmey:\nJust as I began to turn, the coward struck a fierce blow upon my noble head!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou didn't see the criminal's face when that happened?\nAtmey:\n...Well, that's difficult part. How should I put it... I saw his mask... That's all that I can recall.\nJudge:\nHmm... That's not very solid as far as testimony goes.\nAtmey:\nHowever... Fortunately I had my third monocle, the security camera, at the ready. It captured his image perfectly... This should be sufficient, I believe?\nJudge:\nHmm, well, as long as this photo is authentic, I don't see a problem here. Well, Mr. Godot? Do you have a problem with the photo? Good. Then let's continue with the testimony.\nPresent DeMasque's Broach\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"...Mr. Atmey.\"\nAtmey:\nDarkness swallowed me before I could land a single strike. When I awoke, he was gone.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAttacked and knocked unconscious? And you weren't able to do a thing? There's certainly some very impressive detective work.\nAtmey:\nHmph! Well, Sir Lawyer! Have you ever been suddenly struck on the head?\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? W-Well.. Actually, yes. By a fire extinguisher.\nAtmey:\nAnd what happened?\nPhoenix:\n...I-I was knocked out.\nMaya:\nAnd you lost your memory, too!\nAtmey:\nYou see? You have no right to look down on me then, do you? The only reason I didn't lose my memory was because I have more brains to begin with.\nPhoenix:\n(He may have brains, but the wiring to the self-reflection part seems to be served...)\nAtmey:\nIn any case, that was how I was knocked senseless. And then...\nPresent DeMasque's Broach\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"...Mr. Atmey.\"\nAtmey:\nThirty minutes later, I used an emergency phone to notify the police!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAbout this \"30 minutes\"...\nAtmey:\nMy silver cord was loosened and my soul fled to the Golden Halls of Elysium...\nMaya:\nAs usual, I have no idea what this guy is saying.\nPhoenix:\nI think he's saying that he was out cold.\nJudge:\nSo... What happened during these 30 minutes?\nAtmey:\nNo one can say, Your Honor... That span of time has truly vanished into the ether!\nPhoenix:\n(Just what is he going on about!?)\nMaya:\nThere's something suspicious about Detective Atmey... How could he not have noticed when the thief came in?\nPhoenix:\nAlso, he says he was knocked unconscious before he could fight back... But that can't be right. It contradicts the evidence.\nMaya:\nHuh? Which piece...?\nPhoenix:\n(The real question is... Why would he tell such an obvious lie?)\nPhoenix:\n...Mr. Atmey. Could you take a look at this with that special monocle of yours?\nAtmey:\nAha! This belongs to the criminal mastermind, my arch-nemesis, Mask☆DeMasque! It is, in point of fact, Mask☆DeMasque's broach!\nPhoenix:\nIt was found on the floor of the basement warehouse. I wonder how that happened?\nAtmey:\nHa... Elementary, my dear lawyer. Obviously it wasn't glued on well enough.\nPhoenix:\nNot quite. It clearly shows signs of having been ripped off a piece of clothing.\nJudge:\nRipped off...? Aha!\nPhoenix:\n...We can only deduce that the thief struggled with someone that night! That's the only thing I can think of. And there's only one person that was in a position to have a struggle with the thief. The only person that was on security duty that night...You, Detective Atmey!\nAtmey:\n...Urk!\nPhoenix:\nDetective Atmey! You must have fought with the thief that night! (Changed from [Detective Atmey! You must have fought with the thief last night!] in the original release) So, why did you lie in your testimony to the court?\nJudge:\nWitness! Giving false testimony is a serious crime!\nAtmey:\nErr, I... N-No! W-Wait just a moment, Sir Old-Timer!\nJudge:\nDon't talk to me like I'm living in a nursing home!\nAtmey:\nHee hee hee he he he... I just remembered, Your Honor. I was just confused because I've been dealing with so many cases lately.\nGodot:\nThe true measure of a man is in the amount of work he does. That's what I always say.\nMaya:\nNick, you can only handle one case at a time... Isn't that right?\nPhoenix:\nYou talk too much.\nJudge:\nWitness! So are you now saying that you and the thief fought?\nGodot:\nHold on. That's quite enough... Your Honor.\nJudge:\nE-Excuse me...?\nGodot:\nSave the big questions for the testimony. That's one of my rules.\nAtmey:\nIndeed! I understand! I, Luke Atmey, agree completely!\nWitness Testimony\n-- Fight With The Thief --\nAtmey:\nIndeed, it's true that I looked away from the door for a brief moment.\nHowever... Luke Atmey cannot be so easily discombobulated!\nUnfortunately, the thief grabbed a weapon from the side and... rendered me senseless.\nA true gentleman fights only with his own fists... But they were not enough.\nHis first blow struck true! Bam! ...And that's all she wrote.\nJudge:\nSo in the end, you did catch a glimpse of Mask☆DeMasque?\nAtmey:\nCorrect. It was during his third crime that he struck me from behind. It seems that my memory has become a tad jumbled, so to speak.\nJudge:\nHmmm... Well, that's certainly understandable. I, myself, always get confused about which testimony goes with which case.\nPhoenix:\n(Th-That can't be good...)\nCross Examination\n-- Fight With The Thief --\nAtmey:\nIndeed, it's true that I looked away from the door for a brief moment.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo why did you look away from the door anyway?\nAtmey:\nIn addition to the camera, I had prepared a variety of other sensors as well. The alarm on one of those had gone off, so I had to check the data. That's why I went to the computer! ...Elegantly, of course!\nPhoenix:\nSo you were momentarily vulnerable when you were working on the computer? (What should I do? Should I ask some more questions...?)\nThat's enough\nPhoenix:\n(Well, we know for sure that Atmey looked away from the door. I think I should ask about something else now...) Alright. So you looked away from the door. ...And then?\nLeads back to cross-examination\nAbout the sensor\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of sensors are you talking about?\nAtmey:\nThere are other places in the basement that someone could enter and exit from. There are air conditioner ducts, sewer pipes... And a cat door as well. I hooked up heat-detecting, infrared and ultra-violet sensors to each of them.\nPhoenix:\nThat's a lot of hardware... Was it all yours?\nAtmey:\nLordly Tailor Department Store was kind enough to provide the monitoring hardware. Naturally, the security camera that look the photo belongs to them as well.\nPhoenix:\n(In other words, he couldn't have rigged the equipment, huh...?)\nAtmey:\nHee hee hee hee hee... Has that cleared up any doubts you had about me, Sir Lawyer?\nLeads back to cross-examination\nAbout the computer\nPhoenix:\nSo did that computer belong to Lordly Tailor as well?\nAtmey:\nCorrect. Well, except for the program that manages the data. That was specially designed by me, Luke Atmey!\nPhoenix:\n(In that case, he could have easily manipulated the data.)\nAtmey:\nHee hee hee hee hee... What's wrong, Sir Lawyer?\nLeads back to cross-examination\nAtmey:\nHowever... Luke Atmey cannot be so easily discombobulated!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nUmm... What does that mean? \"Discombobulated\"?\nJudge:\nHmm... Young people these days... They really irritate me. They allow perfectly good old words to die until everyone forgets what they mean.\nPhoenix:\nSorry, but what exactly DOES it mean anyway?\nJudge:\n...Now I've forgotten. What was I saying?\nPhoenix:\n(Jeez. It's better than old people who forget what they were saying 5 seconds ago!)\nGodot:\n...Well, it looks like we've cleared that up. You can go on with your testimony.\nAtmey:\nUnfortunately, the thief grabbed a weapon from the side and... rendered me senseless.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean by \"weapon from the side\"?\nAtmey:\nNaturally, that thief had no idea that I, Luke Atmey, was hiding in the area! He grabbed the sword from the statue that was standing by the door to the warehouse.\nPhoenix:\nSword...? You mean the sword that was all twisted like a tree branch?\nAtmey:\nCorrect. Fortunately for me, the blade was not sharp.\nPhoenix:\n(OK. so he IS talking about the Shichishito...)\nJudge:\nSo the thief armed himself with a sword. And what about yourself, witness?\nAtmey:\nA true gentleman fights only with his own fists... But they were not enough.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou had that much faith in your own fighting abilities?\nAtmey:\nBut of course. In college, I was the 2nd in-charge of the boxing club.\nJudge:\nI'm sorry if I fail to find that appropriately impressive.\nAtmey:\nHowever! My opponent in the ring this time was my arch-nemesis, Mask☆DeMasque!\nPhoenix:\n(This guy is a real piece of work...)\nAtmey:\nHis first blow struck true! Bam! ...And that's all she wrote.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nCan you tell us a little more about what happened?\nAtmey:\nMy opponent was both powerful and vicious. You might say he was... \"powericious\".\nPhoenix:\n(\"P-Powericious\"?)\nAtmey:\nI assumed the \"Atmey Fighting Stance\", but a sudden flash of light blinded me! That of course was checkmate! My opponent had bested me.\nPhoenix:\n(What do I do now? Should I ask more about this...?)\nLeave it\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I guess it's true that Atmey was knocked senseless after all. I'd better ask him about something else instead...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\"You were blinded\"?\nPhoenix:\nSo what was this flash of light that blinded you?\nAtmey:\n...I was bathed in a golden light that seemed to come from the statue of the woman.\nPhoenix:\n(The statue of Ami Fey, I'm guessing...)\nMaya:\nWell that wasn't very much help at all...\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\"Atmey Fighting Style\"?\nPhoenix:\nWhat is this \"Atmey Fighting Style\"?\nAtmey:\nI'm sorry but that's a trade secret... I really can't say any more. But, I suppose I can tell you if I absolutely must. The main thing is to put your back to the wall. That way no one can get behind you.\nPhoenix:\n(That's it...? That's the \"Atmey Fighting Style\"?)\nJudge:\nHmmm... Well, Mr. Wright? What about that testimony...?\nIt was a waste of time.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I guess it's true that Atmey was knocked senseless after all. I'd better ask him about something else instead...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nIt was very important.\nPhoenix:\nOf course it's important! We've learned a detective's SECRET technique, after all.\nJudge:\nYes, indeed... I'll remember to use it if I ever take a walk alone late at night.\nPhoenix:\n(Why the heck is he eye-balling me like that...? It's creeping me out...)\nJudge:\n...Now then, witness! We'll go ahead and add that secret information to your official testimony!\nChanges statement from \"His first blow struck true! Bam! ...And that's all she wrote.\" to \"I put my back to the wall to fight, but the thief's blow landed upon my third eye.\"\nAtmey:\nI put my back to the wall to fight, but the thief's blow landed upon my third eye.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Where is this \"third eye\" you're talking about?\nAtmey:\nOh... it's right between my right and left eye brows. ...It's quite invisible to the unenlightened. You may call it the forehead, if you like.\nPhoenix:\n(Why didn't you just say that in the first place!?)\nAtmey:\nSir Lawyer! It looks like the creases in your own forehead are getting deeper!\nMaya:\nSo Mr. Atmey got hit on the forehead then?\nPhoenix:\nThat's what he says.\nMaya:\nHmm... I've got a funny feeling about that.\nPhoenix:\n(Actually, so do I.)\nPresent Shichishito\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Detective Atmey! Your testimony is crumbling like a house of cards.\"\nMaya:\nWell what do you think, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nWell, there's one thing that I'm absolutely sure of now.\nMaya:\nYeah? What is it!?\nPhoenix:\nThe Luke Atmey guy... He's definitely hiding something!\nMaya:\nB-But why?\nPhoenix:\nI think I'm starting to figure out what really happened that night. (...And about the true nature of this \"detective\".)\nPhoenix:\nDetective Atmey! Your testimony is crumbling like a house of cards.\nAtmey:\nWhat fun this is, Sir Lawyer! It is truly a pleasure to cross swords with you! And now, once again, you have thrown down the gauntlet at my armored feet...\nPhoenix:\nI believe this is what you said yesterday.\nAtmey:\nNo, the coward must have wormed his way in through somewhere besides the door... Then my arch-nemesis struck me on the head from behind with this gruesome item here!\nJudge:\nFrom behind, huh?\nPhoenix:\nBut just now you testified that he struck you on the forehead... I hardly think you could forget where you were hit on the head!\nAtmey:\n...Urk! It seems... I-I've made another mistake.\nPhoenix:\n...Detective Atmey. That's not the only strange part of your testimony.\nJudge:\nWh-What do you mean by that?\nPhoenix:\nFor example... The very fact that you hid the calling card from the police itself is strange! It's almost as if... You were afraid they were going to help with security!\nAtmey:\nU-Urk...! Geniuses such as myself have always been misunderstood! How sad...\nPhoenix:\nThat's wrong!\nGodot:\nGodot:\n...To err is human, to forgive divine. Humans aren't machines... They have souls, feelings. They live, they die, they love, they hate... And yes, they even make mistakes...\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHey, hold on! It-It's not as pretty as that!\nGodot:\nReally? What is it like then!?\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nAlways chase a riddle down to the end. That's one of my rules.\nPhoenix:\n(This is it... This might just be my chance to turn things around!)\nJudge:\n...Mr. Wright. What exactly is it that you're asserting?\nPhoenix:\nVery well, Your Honor. The defense asserts that...\nMr. Atmey is no Ace Detective!\nPhoenix:\nThe truth is... this witness is no Ace Detective at all!\nAtmey:\n...So then what exactly are you saying that I am?\nPhoenix:\nUh, umm... Well, an average detective...?\nJudge:\nI hardly see the relevance of that.\nMaya:\nWh-What are you doing, Nick!? Weren't you going to go on the attack?\nPhoenix:\nI was planning on it, but it looks I'm the one who got attacked instead.\nJudge:\nThink harder next time!\nLeads back to:\n\"...Mr. Wright. What exactly is it that you're asserting?\"\nthis Mr. Atmey is a fake!\nPhoenix:\nThis witness isn't Luke Atmey... He's a fake!\nAtmey:\n...So now it's not just Mask☆DeMasque. You're saying I'm a fake, too?\nPhoenix:\nAn Ace Detective could never be as forgetful as this guy!\nGodot:\nImposters like you are often suspicious of others as well.\nJudge:\nReally, this is too much. Next you'll be calling me a fake, too!\nLeads back to:\n\"...Mr. Wright. What exactly is it that you're asserting?\"\nMr. Atmey is Mask☆DeMasque!\nLeads to:\n\"The answer is simple! It's all clear to me now!\"\nPhoenix:\nThe answer is simple! It's all clear to me now! Detective Luke Atmey's true identity is actually... Mask☆DeMasque!\nAtmey:\nYeeeeaaargggh!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Mr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!?\nPhoenix:\nThere are too many unnatural parts to Mr. Atmey's story. He says he was \"hiding\" at the crime scenes, which is why no one ever saw him there. And then, in his last case, he manages to outperform Detective Gumshoe and... ...the entire police force to \"miraculously\" retrieve the stolen treasure.\nAtmey:\nTh-That's because... I analyzed the crime scene data and made an exquisitely elegant deduction. I picked up clues that the police overlooked in order to arrive at a...\nPhoenix:\nOh, please! The explanation is far simpler than that, \"Detective Atmey\"! The truth is that you are, in fact, Mask☆DeMasque.\nAtmey:\nGurk...!\nJudge:\nB-But Mr. Wright! Th-This photo! It clearly shows Mask☆DeMasque! This security camera belongs to Lordly Tailor Department Store! He shouldn't have been able to manipulate it...\nPhoenix:\nHe didn't need to manipulate it! He gained access to the warehouse under the pretense of providing \"security\"... Then he simply dressed as the \"thief\" and stole the urn.\nJudge:\nSo... the Ace Detective is actually an Ace Thief! Is this true, witness!?\nAtmey:\n... Aha... Hee hee hee ha ha ha Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ho ho ho hee hee hee! DeMasque's M. O. is pure genius! And so am I, Luke Atmey, Ace Detective!! You're very clever to have come to such a conclusion! I am impressed, Sir Lawyer!\nJudge:\nWh-Whaaaaat!? Witness! You... You're admitting it!?\nMaya:\nN-Nick! Now's your chance!\nPhoenix:\nYes! Time to put the last nail in this guy's coffin! Detective Atmey! When you assumed the thief's identity--\nGodot:\nGodot:\nGodot Blend #102... ...My personal favorite.\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Godot!\nGodot:\n\"The Ace Detective is actually an Ace Thief!\" I smell a best-selling novel! There's only one problem... It simply isn't true.\nJudge:\nB-But Mr. Godot! Mr. Wright has made some very strong points and I...\nGodot:\nI will admit my opponent has woven a compelling narrative out of whole cloth. But it is, in fact, nothing more than a patchwork quilt. Mr. Trite... If this detective really is the thief, then show us the proof of your claim. But it had better be as hot... and as perfect as the coffee dripping down your face!\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Wright!? Don't just stand there! This court would like to see this decisive proof you have! Quickly!\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? Oh! Y-Yes, of course! (Wh-What's the big rush...?)\nMaya:\nAre you alright, Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Atmey looks pretty rattled right now... I'd like to finish this right now if I can. But can I really do it?) The decisive evidence that proves Mr. Luke Atmey is in fact Mask☆DeMasque...\nis right here!\nPhoenix:\nAs usual, the defense comes prepared, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nVery well then... Let's see what you've got. Please present proof that Mask☆DeMasque is actually Mr. Luke Atmey!\nPresent anything\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHere's your proof!\nJudge:\nWhat do you think, Mr. Godot?\nGodot:\nIt looks to me like Mr. Trite is still a mite sleepy. Perhaps he'd like a big mug of my special Godot blend? Well?\nPhoenix:\nN-No thanks, I'm fine! Really! (What do I do now? Another mistake like that and I'm through! Without some decisive evidence, I could be risking everything...)\nI've got all I need.\nLeads back to:\n\"As usual, the defense comes prepared, Your Honor!\"\nI don't have a thing.\nLeads to:\n\"Proof? Of course I... I... ...I've got nothing.\"\nhas yet to be found!\nLeads to:\n\"Proof? Of course I... I... ...I've got nothing.\"\nPhoenix:\nProof? Of course I... I... ...I've got nothing.\nGodot:\nHa...! Just what I thought. A man has to told his head up high no matter how bad things get, after all.\nPhoenix:\nUuugh...\nJudge:\nI see... I thought perhaps you had some evidence to back up your assertion...\nPhoenix:\n(This is no good! I've got to stay on the attack! I'll never get another chance to prove that this guy is the thief!)\nMaya:\nDon't give up, Nick! Think harder and try again!\nPhoenix:\nIt's no good... I'm just not ready yet...\nMaya:\nB-But... Are you going to just give up and let us lose this?\nAtmey:\nSo, you've come to your senses, have you, Sir Lawyer?\nPhoenix:\nI... Unnngh... (Argh! I can't think of a counter-attack at all...)\nJudge:\nIt seems the cloud of suspicion surrounding this witness has lifted. Mr. Godot. If you have anything further to add, then--\n???:\nJudge:\nWh... Wh-Who... ...Who are you?\nDesirée:\nThat doesn't really matter right now, does it?\nPhoenix:\nMs. DeLite! What are you doing here?\nDesirée:\nNicky boy! The thing you've been looking for... I think I found it!\nJudge:\nYou mean... that bag!?\nDesirée:\nNo, not the bag! What's in the bag! ...Well?\nJudge:\nTh-That's...\nMaya:\nThe Sacred Urn!! Nick! It's the urn!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order! ...You! Madame...! That urn... Where did you find it!?\nDesirée:\nYou'll never believe it... It was in the office of Mr. Fancy Pants Ace Detective! ...Luke Atmey!\nRon:\nOh, Dessie! You're the best!\nSacred Urn updated in the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nWell? How do you explain that one, Mr. Atmey!?\nAtmey:\n...\nPhoenix:\nEven you are going to have a hard time weaseling out of this one!\nGodot:\nGodot:\nHa...! Pathetic...\nJudge:\nMr. Godot...? Do you have something you wish to say?\nGodot:\nYes, Your Honor... It simply amazes me how quickly times change... In the old days, a man was to be taken at his word. It's truly sad...\nJudge:\nYou're still denying that Mr. Atmey was involved!?\nGodot:\nBefore casting aspersions at Detective Atmey, consider the young lady here. Your name is Desirée... Desirée DeLite. Is that correct?\nDesirée:\nY-Yes! What about it?\nGodot:\nHa...! How charming... The lengths that a woman is willing to go to save her husband is truly inspiring.\nDesirée:\nWh-What are you insinuating!?\nGodot:\nAs the wife of the criminal, you could have \"discovered\" that stolen urn anywhere. Including the office of the good detective here. So you found the urn. What does that prove? It certainly doesn't prove where the urn was before you \"found\" it.\nDesirée:\nWhat...? I just brought it here from the detective's office!\nGodot:\nPlease Madame... This town is already filled to the brim with lies. Any more could only compound the tragedy we have been witness to.\nDesirée:\nYou're wrong! I would never...! I would never do such a thing!\nPhoenix:\nMs. DeLite...\nDesirée:\nPlease, Nicky boy! You've got to help me talk some sense into these people!\nPhoenix:\n(There must be some way! I've got to prove that urn was actually in the Atmey Detective Agency...)\nTestify about what I saw\nPhoenix:\n...\nGodot:\nWhat's wrong? Isn't it your job to come up with something to say...?\nMaya:\nNick! Come on! It should be easy to prove! After all, we checked out that bag, didn't we?\nPhoenix:\nYou're right. I remember doing that. Whatever was in there, it was hard and round... And smooth, too.\nMaya:\nYes! It must have been the urn! It must have!\nPhoenix:\nBut... I never actually saw it with my own eyes.\nMaya:\n...?\nPhoenix:\nAtmey walked in just when I was about to have a look at it... So even if it was the urn in there, I can't testify that it was.\nMaya:\nAck! You're right!!\nGodot:\nHa...! It looks like I was wrong about you, Mr. Trite. In this town overflowing with lies, there's still a single flickering candle of truth.\nDesirée:\nNicky boy...!\nPhoenix:\n(Well, it's true that I never actually saw the urn... But maybe I can still testify about it from another angle!)\nJudge:\nWhat about it, Mr. Wright? Have you given up yet...?\nLeads back to:\n\"There must be some way!\"\nShow fingerprints on the urn\nPhoenix:\nI can prove where the urn was... ...by the fingerprints on it!\nJudge:\nFingerprints, eh...\nAtmey:\nOh come now! Now you're really making me laugh, Sir Lawyer! Fingerprints indeed!\nPhoenix:\n...\nAtmey:\nMay I go on? Good. Now it would be perfectly understandable if my fingerprints were on the urn. After all, it was I who was guarding the urn in the first place! In any case, I am always in the habit of wearing gloves as you can see. So unfortunately, my fingerprints wouldn't be evidence of anything.\nJudge:\nWhat about it, Mr. Wright? This witness's fingerprints would mean nothing anyway.\nMaya:\nN-Nick, what are you going to do now?\nPhoenix:\n(I've come too far to turn back now! Atmey must have brought the urn back to his office yesterday... And there, I'm sure someone must have left their fingerprints on it...!) The defense proposes that the fingerprints of this person should be on the urn!\nPresent Phoenix Wright profile\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"So what is all this fuss about fingerprints anyway...?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nGodot:\nLet me give you an important piece of advice. The one who keeps a cool head all the way until the game's end is the winner.\nJudge:\nLet me give you an even more important piece of advice, Mr. Wright... You are not going to win this game with that answer.\nMaya:\nWow... Even the judge is making cool, snappy remarks now...\nPhoenix:\n(D-Does that mean I was wrong again? Hmm... The urn was put in that bag and carried to the detective's office yesterday. That means the person I should be fingering is... the person who left their prints on the urn yesterday at the Atmey Detective Agency!)\nMaya:\nDo you really think there's someone that could fit the bill?\nName another person\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? What have you decided?\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! Please give me just one more chance!\nLeads back to:\n\"The defense proposes that the fingerprints of this person should be on the urn!\"\nThink it over again\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? What have you decided to do?\nPhoenix:\nForgive me, Your Honor. I've decided to think the whole thing over again.\nLeads back to:\n\"There must be some way!\"\nI can't prove anything yet\nPhoenix:\nI can't prove anything yet.\nMaya:\nBut Nick!\nJudge:\nVery well... It looks like that's all then.\nGodot:\nExactly... And this urn is all the proof I need to make my case...\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nGodot:\nYou still don't get it, huh? Listen closely, Mr. Trite. This is the urn that Mask☆DeMasque stole, right? Now the wife of the accused comes strolling in here with the very same urn, correct? Now, who would you think is the thief?\nPhoenix:\nAh...!\nDesirée:\nNo! That's wrong! That's not why I've got it...\nMaya:\nN-Nick! Y-You can't let him do this...\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, this isn't good... There has to be another way around this...) Your Honor! Please let me think it over one more time!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. It's high time that you learn your lesson. The courtroom is no place for poorly thought-out or rash declarations!\nPhoenix:\n(I have to be careful... He won't be so nice next time...)\nLeads back to:\n\"There must be some way!\"\nAtmey:\nSo what is all this fuss about fingerprints anyway...?\nPhoenix:\nMr. Atmey... Do you recall the events of yesterday?\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Come on! Open it up!\nPhoenix:\nHey! Wait a minute! We can't just open his private property!\nMaya:\nDon't be such a fuddy-duddy! This is an important investigation! Well? What's in there?\nPhoenix:\nH-Hang on a sec. I'm taking it out now... (Whatever it is, it feels... kinda hard... and smooth...)\nAtmey:\n...Well, hello there!!\nPhoenix:\nIt's true that I didn't get a chance to look in the bag at that time. But! I did touch what was inside.\nAtmey:\nWh-What!? Y-You touched it...?\nPhoenix:\nAnd I remember it very well. It was \"smooth and hard\".\nAtmey:\nW-Well, err... Th-That was just...\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! I'd like the court to examine the fingerprints on that urn. If my fingerprints are on there... Then it proves that the urn was in Detective Atmey's office!\nGodot:\nGodot:\nWell, even if your fingerprints are on the urn... ...it still doesn't prove when they were put there, does it?\nPhoenix:\nOf course it does.\nGodot:\nWh-What did you just say!?\nPhoenix:\nIt's not what I say, it's what Adrian Andrews, the person in charge of the exhibition said. (Changed from [Not what I said, it's what Adrian Andrews, the person in charge of the exhibition said.] in the original release)\nAndrews:\nI polished it until it was just about glowing... I thought maybe I could make it looks more valuable!\nPhoenix:\nIf she polished it that much, she must have removed any and all fingerprints on it. And the only chance I had to get my fingerprints on it after that was... Yesterday! At the Atmey Detective Agency!\nGodot:\nHa...! This blend... Godot Blend #107... I've decided... It's a little too bitter after all!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order! I accept the defense's request! Bailiff! Take this urn and...\nAtmey:\nWait! Wait a moment, Your Honor! ...There's no need for that.\nJudge:\nN-No need you say...?\nAtmey:\nPrecisely... I already know Mr. Wright's fingerprints are on the urn...\nJudge:\nWh-What are you saying!\nPhoenix:\n(Yes! I've finally broken him down!)\nAtmey:\nHee hee hee ha ha ha Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ho ho ho hee hee! Take a good look, everyone! Unable to find a rival worthy of my genius, I was forced to create one by myself! Here I am! The tragic clown...\nMaya:\nThis guy is nuttier than a fruitcake...\nAtmey:\nYou see! It was me all along! I am the one and only Mask☆DeMasque! Ha ha! I hope you all enjoyed my little performance! Hee hee hee ha ha ha Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ho ho ho hee hee hee!\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Godot... What's Mr. Atmey's condition?\nGodot:\nHe's still in the lobby, laughing insanely, Your Honor. I wish I could enjoy the joke as much as he seems to be.\nJudge:\nWell, it looks like the matter has been settled. I came perilously close to besmirching the record of an innocent young man. Besmirching him with the title of \"thief\"!\nMaya:\nNick, you were right after all!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah! I guess Mr. DeLite really wasn't the thief!)\nJudge:\nThe court finds the defendant, Mr. Ron DeLite...\n???:\nRon:\nYou're wrong! Wrong I tell you! Err, umm, I mean... Not exactly wrong so much, but actually not right is what I really trying to say\nPhoenix:\n(Oh no... He's not... This can't be happening...)\nRon:\nThe thief... The sneaky, odious thief who's been stealing all the treasures... It's me! I'm him! I'm the one you want! I'm the thief I tell you! So do it...! Pronounce me guilty! Pleeeease!!\nPhoenix:\n...\nGodot:\n...\n............\nJudge:\nI don't know what kind of a kangaroo court you all think this is, but...\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThe true identity of the thief has already been proven! Please hurry and pass judg--\nRon:\nWhat are you talking about!? I already confessed! I'm the thief I tell you!\nJudge:\n...Mr. Godot! Don't just stand there drinking coffee!\nGodot:\nHa...! Hey there, Mr. Thief...\nRon:\nY-Yes! Yes, sir!?\nGodot:\nIf you're really a man, then clean up your own mess.\nRon:\nI-I'm sorry... I'm afraid I just don't have any idea what do you mean.\nGodot:\nIf you are Mask☆DeMasque... then prove it. That's what it means.\nRon:\nY-Yes, sir! I'll be happy to!\nMaya:\nHe says he'll be happy to, Nick...\nPhoenix:\nIt's kinda cute... He's 100% committed to his fantasy.\nGodot:\nGood boy! Just remember one thing. A boy only gets one chance in his life to become a man!\nRon:\nI-I know that! I-I won't fail! I swear!\nGodot:\nOK, then... Talk! ...We're all listening.\nJudge:\nOh well... Let's all have a listen to this \"confession\"...\nWitness Testimony\n-- Mask☆DeMasque's Identity --\nRon:\nThe truth is, I've been Mask☆DeMasque all along!\nI mean, you can't prove that I'm not actually Mask☆DeMasque, can you?\nI don't have an alibi for the night the urn was stolen, after all!\nI donned my costume that night and dancingly descended upon the scene of the crime!\nLook! You can see right there in the photo! That's me!\nAs for my broach, I snagged it on the door handle and it got torn off, that's all!\nJudge:\nHmm... I don't like the direction this trial has taken...\nPhoenix:\n(But this is how every trial goes... At least with me, anyway...)\nGodot:\nHa...! You're doing great!\nRon:\nHee hee hee... Stop it, Mr. Godot... You're embarrassing me.\nGodot:\nLike I said, you're only going to get one chance to testify, alright? But if you make it through this with flying colors, I'll keep my promise, too. I'll make sure you stay locked up in prison as the one and only true Mask☆DeMasque!\nRon:\nThanks so much, Mr. Godot! I... I'll do my best!\nJudge:\nAlright, Mr. Wright. I'm afraid it's time for the cross-examination.\nPhoenix:\n*sigh*\nCross Examination\n-- Mask☆DeMasque's Identity --\nRon:\nThe truth is, I've been Mask☆DeMasque all along!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou may think you're real Mask☆DeMasque... but your wife thinks you're delusional.\nRon:\nI haven't told Dessie yet... About my true identity, I mean... Believe me, I've got my reasons.\nPhoenix:\n(With the way your room is decked out, how could she NOT know about it...?)\nJudge:\nHmm... Even thieves have complicated family situations, I suppose.\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? It sounds like we're about to get sidetracked... again.)\nPress harder\nPhoenix:\nSo why are you withholding the truth from your wife?\nRon:\nWell... first of all, I don't think she'd believe me anyway... And second... If there's one thing that Dessie absolutely detests... ...it's criminals.\nJudge:\nIf that's the case, then why did you ever start thieving to begin with?\nRon:\nWell, Dessie is crazy about shopping. She's a real shopaholic... But she's the love of my life, Your Honor. I guess you could say I'm a \"Dessie-aholic\"...\nJudge:\nHmm... So you do have a complicated family situation after all.\nPhoenix:\n...Alright, that's enough. Please continue with your testimony. I beg of you.\nLeads back to cross-examination\nLeave it\nPhoenix:\n(There's no point in digging through any more of their dirty laundry...) Well, why don't you continue with your testimony for now.\nLeads back to cross-examination\nRon:\nI mean, you can't prove that I'm not actually Mask☆DeMasque, can you?\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nUmm... I thought you were going to be the one to show US the proof. You know, that you're the real Mask☆DeMasque and not just some kind of obsessed fanboy.\nRon:\nHey now, that's not fair. Why do I have to do all the hard work anywaaaaay!?\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe because you're the one making the outrageous claim... for a change.)\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! You know that Mr. DeLite couldn't have committed the crime! You're the one with the fancy law degree! It's time to put it to work already!\nPhoenix:\nI need some kind of proof that Ron couldn't possibly be Mask☆DeMasque...\nMaya:\nWell, I guess if you had that kind of proof, we wouldn't still be here, would we...?\nPhoenix:\n(For the time being, maybe I need to shift strategy... I should try to show that Mr. DeLite couldn't have stolen the urn.)\nRon:\nAnyway, I...\nPresent Ron's Wallet or Key Card\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. DeLite. This wallet belongs to you, correct?\"\nRon:\nI don't have an alibi for the night the urn was stolen, after all!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou've got no alibi...?\nJudge:\nI've been a judge for a long time... And this is the first time I've ever heard a defendant brag about having no alibi.\nRon:\nBut I tell you I was in Lordly Tailor that night! ...Errr, no. That's too vague, even for me. To be more precise, I was down in the basement warehouse.\nPhoenix:\n(Hold on...)\nMaya:\nWhat is it, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nWhere was Ron DeLite when the crime happened anyway...? If we can prove he had an alibi after all, this case will be a piece of cake.\nMaya:\nW-Well, you're right, but...\nGodot:\nHa...! You think you can prove that? Wake up and smell the coffee!\nPhoenix:\nW-Well, I think maybe I can...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, do you have any evidence that shows the defendant has an alibi?\nNo, I have no evidence.\nPhoenix:\nOf course not! Don't be ridiculous!\nJudge:\nI-I'm sorry! ...Say! What am I apologizing for!? You! Witness! Hurry up with your testimony already!\nRon:\nI-I'm sorry! ...Why is it that I'm always the one that has to apologize to everyone in the end.\nLeads back to cross-examination\nYes, I have evidence.\nPhoenix:\nI have the evidence! Or do you think I'm still some sort of third-rate rookie!?\nJudge:\nOh...! I-I've never seen you this angry before!\nGodot:\n...I'm not surprised. Anger is the last refuge of the pathetic.\nPhoenix:\n(I thought I was more confident than angry...)\nJudge:\nWell then, let's see this evidence already. Show to this court evidence that proves where your client was on the night of the crime!\nPresent Ron's Wallet or Key Card\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. DeLite. This wallet belongs to you, correct?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHere's the evidence!\nGodot:\nHa...! It looks like I was right. ...Mr. Trite. The more pathetic a man is, the more likely he is to start pointing fingers!\nPhoenix:\nFor some reason, the good Prosecutor really wants to prove that I'm \"pathetic\"...\nJudge:\nThat's because you are pathetic! And so is your \"evidence\"!\nPhoenix:\n(Oops. I guess I was wrong... Again.)\nRon:\nAha! I told you I didn't have an alibi!\nLeads back to cross-examination\nPresent Ron's Wallet or Key Card\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. DeLite. This wallet belongs to you, correct?\"\nRon:\nI donned my costume that night and dancingly descended upon the scene of the crime!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\n\"Dancingly descended\"...? From where exactly?\nRon:\nWell... From the entrance, I suppose. Where else?\nPhoenix:\n(So in actuality, he neither \"danced\" nor \"descended\"! ...Someone save me. Again.)\nMaya:\nI guess he thinks \"descended\" sounds more heroic or thief-like or something.\nRon:\nA-Anyway! I was there at the crime scene! Just like I said!\nRon:\nLook! You can see right there in the photo! That's me!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThis is the photo that was taken by the security camera at the crime scene...\nJudge:\nNo doubt about it. That's Mask☆DeMasque.\nPhoenix:\nYes, but don't forget there's something important missing. The real Mask☆DeMasque has a big broach on his chest!\nRon:\nAs for my broach, I snagged it on the door handle and it got torn off, that's all!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou didn't notice it when your broach was torn off?\nRon:\nHuh!? W-Well... I'm always a little nervous when I'm working.\nPhoenix:\n(There's a bit of clothing left on the back side of the broach. I don't think it could have been torn off that easily...)\nMaya:\nYes, but... I don't see what that has to do with anything. Right now we're trying to prove that Mr. DeLite isn't the thief, right?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I guess so. (Let me hear that testimony one more time.)\nMaya:\nWhy does Mr. DeLite want to be Mask☆DeMasque so badly anyway? It's kinda disturbing. He doesn't seem like your typical attention whore to me. Unlike, say... you, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nI am nothing of the sort, thank you very much. (But I gotta admit it is kinda scary the way Ron acts...)\nMaya:\nAnyway... Time to poke some holes in that testimony of his!\nPhoenix:\nMr. DeLite. This wallet belongs to you, correct?\nRon:\nAh! Y-Yes. It-It does. I-I had lost it somewhere!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! When you find a wallet, you should report it to the police right away!\nPhoenix:\nAh! No! You don't understand. This is an important piece of evidence.\nJudge:\n\"Evidence\"...?\nPhoenix:\nMr. DeLite... When did you first notice that you'd lost your wallet?\nRon:\nErr, let's see... I think it was on the night of the crime... But I know I still had it when Dessie and I went out for dinner.\nPhoenix:\nThis wallet was found at approximately 1:00 AM at KB Security headquarters.\nJudge:\nWhat...!? Surely you're not serious!?\nPhoenix:\nYes... I am serious. This proves that Mr. DeLite was, in fact, at KB Security that night!\nRon:\nNoooooo!\nPhoenix:\nSo if the defendant was at KB Security at 1 o'clock in the morning... ...then that proves that he has a watertight alibi!\nRon:\nNoooooo!\nPhoenix:\nFurthermore, considering the distance between Lordly Tailor and KB Security... ...it would have taken 30 minutes to get there by car! (According to Larry anyway...)\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Godot!? Do you have anything to say? And stop drinking that coffee!\nGodot:\n...Come on, Mr. Thief. Don't let this guy beat you! Tell him why he's wrong!\nRon:\nYou're the only one who calls me \"thief\", Mr. Godot... ...Alright, I'll try! I-I'll do it! I will!\nMaya:\n...He's really got Mr. DeLite all worked up...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, he's like a kid at his first day of school...\nRon:\nLook, it's just ridiculous! Why would I have dropped my wallet at KB Security!? Someone must have planted it there to make it LOOK like I was there and not at the heist.\nMaya:\n\"Planted it there\"? He's really reaching now...\nPhoenix:\nMr. DeLite. You probably dropped your wallet when you took it out to use this, didn't you? The key card to KB Security's CEO's office.\nRon:\nNoooo!\nGodot:\nHa...! That was a pretty good try, Mr. Trite... Unfortunately, you've overlooked one small thing.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What...?\nGodot:\n\"Motive\" of course! Why would this thief go to KB Security in the middle of the night anyway!?\nJudge:\nHmm... Well, Mr. Wright? It looks like you need some more evidence after all.\nPhoenix:\n(Grrr! This stupid kid...!)\nJudge:\nNow then. Let's see your evidence. The evidence that shows why Mr. DeLite went to KB Security at 1 AM that night!\nPresent Blackmail Letter\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. DeLite... I believe you've seen this before, correct?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHere is your evidence!\nRon:\n...What is this supposed to mean, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? Well, um... Don't you know?\nRon:\nMr. Wright... If you're a real man, you should clean up your own mess.\nPhoenix:\nDoh...! (For some reason, it bothers me more when HE says it!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Now then. Let's see your evidence.\"\nPhoenix:\nMr. DeLite... I believe you've seen this before, correct?\nRon:\nAh...! Th-That's...!\nJudge:\nWhat is it?\nPhoenix:\nA blackmail letter. That's what it looks like from the contents.\nGodot:\nB-Blackmail...?\nPhoenix:\nYes, basically it says, \"bring $50,000 dollars\". [sic]\nJudge:\nHmm... That certainly sounds like blackmail alright...\nPhoenix:\nAt the time of the theft, Mr. DeLite was dealing with the blackmailer himself... ...in KB Security's CEO office, a full half an hour away from the scene of the crime!\nGodot:\n...Ungh... Urk... No No No No No NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! OOOOORDER!! So when the theft of the urn occurred, the defendant was at KB Security... It looks like a perfect case for the defense!\nGodot:\nGodot:\n...You may see it as a perfect case, Judge, but to me... Well, let's just say that my Godot Blend #107 impresses me a lot more.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What are you trying to say?\nGodot:\nYou say the thief was being blackmailed by the CEO of a security company... But... Did you actually investigate this CEO at all?\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? Well, umm... No... I guess not.\nGodot:\nAccusing a man of blackmail with no proof? I'm not sure what I think of that...\nPhoenix:\n(\"Not sure what I think of that\"...? At least I know what I think of you...)\nJudge:\nHmm... Good point. I'm not sure what I think of it myself... You claim that the defendant entered the CEO's office... ...but you will need at least one witness to corroborate your claim, Mr. Wright.\nMaya:\nNick! I think we're going to have to track down the CEO guy...\nPhoenix:\nNo, we don't have to track down the CEO at all.\nGodot:\nWhat do you mean by that, Mr. Trite?\nPhoenix:\nThere is someone else who can testify. This is the person who can testify that the key card was used at 1 AM that night!\nPresent Larry Butz profile\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Wh-Who is this useless-looking young man?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nGodot:\nHa...! That's the first time one of your jokes actually made me truly laugh.\nPhoenix:\n(Umm, I haven't actually made any jokes... Not intentionally anyway...)\nJudge:\nWell, perhaps you find it funny, but I fail to see any humor in it!\nPhoenix:\n(The problem is the key card that was in Ron's wallet... Somehow I need to prove that the card was used at 1 o'clock in the morning.)\nLeads back to:\n\"There is someone else who can testify.\"\nJudge:\nWh-Who is this useless-looking young man?\nPhoenix:\nYou don't remember him, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nHmmmm... Not exactly... But just looking at his picture makes the bile start to rise in my throat.\nMaya:\nIt looks like he doesn't remember the case from 2 years ago...\nPhoenix:\nHe probably blocked out that memory on purpose. Anyway, this man was working as a guard at KB Security that night.\nGodot:\nOh...?\nPhoenix:\nThe question at hand is this key card.\nButz:\nYup. That's the key card they use at the building I work in. According to the serial number, this one is for the CEO's office. You need it to get into that room, and every time you use that card, it leaves a record.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\nAs you can see, there's no need to investigate the CEO of KB Security! We should be able to discover the truth simply by analyzing this key card's data!\nGodot:\nBwaaaah...!\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Godot?\nGodot:\nThe name of the CEO of KB Security is Kane Bullard. I was unable to contact him directly, but... I got the key card data. ...Here.\nJudge:\nS-So what does it show!?\nGodot:\nEach key card has its own serial number and they leave detailed records of their use. According to this data... this card was used at 1 AM on the morning of the crime.\nKey Card updated in the Court Record.\nJudge:\nBut that means... it can't be Mr. DeLite dressed as Mask☆DeMasque in this photo!\nGodot:\nHa...! It looks like you're right. Two minutes isn't even enough time to brew a good cup o' Joe...\nPhoenix:\nSo... So then...!\nGodot:\nRon DeLite was clearly in the office of KB Security's CEO at the time of the crime. ...The prosecutor's office is ready to admit that fact. Therefore, it's impossible for the defendant to be Mask☆DeMasque.\nMaya:\nGood job! You did it, Nick!\nJudge:\n...That's enough! I came perilously close to besmirching the record of an innocent young man. Besmirching him with the title of \"thief\"! ...\nPhoenix:\nWh-What's wrong, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nI'm ready to pass judgement... But before I do that, do you have any further objections?\nPhoenix:\nNo, Your Honor!\nGodot:\nHrpmh...!\nRon:\nUnnnggh...\nJudge:\n...Very well. The court finds the defendant, Mr. Ron DeLite...\nNot Guilty\nJudge:\nCourt is now adjourned! (Changed from [This court is adjourned!] in the original release)\nOctober 13, 2:24 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 4\nMaya:\nNick! You did it! You were right after all! Actually... I'm a little bit ashamed of myself.\nDesirée:\nNicky boy!\nPhoenix:\nOh! Ms. DeLite...!\nDesirée:\nI knew you could do it! I believed in you all along, Nicky boy! ...I don't know how I can ever repay you.\nPhoenix:\nAww... Shucks... Thanks, Ms. DeLite. (I just know I'm blushing...)\nPearl:\nCongratulations, Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nOh! P-Pearls...! (I've got a bad feeling about this...)\nPearl:\n*gasp!* Wh-Who is this woman!\nPhoenix:\nOh, she... She's nobody... She's just ahh...\nPearl:\nYou're blushing! How dare you do this in front of Mystic Maya! You should be ashamed of yourself!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeowch! She slapped me...)\nMaya:\nUmm, Pearly... This woman is Ms. Desirée DeLite. She's our client's wife.\nPearl:\n*gasp!* Mr. Nick!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes!?\nPearl:\nYou're even worse than I thought! Going behind the back of your own client...!\nPhoenix:\nN-N-No! You've got it all wrong!\nPearl:\nI'll never forgive you!\nPhoenix:\n(Owww... A double slap...)\nMaya:\nWell, anyway, All's well that ends well, right? We got the Sacred Urn back and the thief has been caught!\nDesirée:\nYou're so right! And it's all thanks to Nicky boy here!\nMaya:\nBut actually it was you, Ms. DeLite, that brought us our urn back! Thank you from the bottom of my heart!\nDesirée:\nOh, please... You're embarrassing me!\nPhoenix:\n(If we won the case... ...then why does this guy still look so glum...?)\nRon:\nUgggh... But I am the thief... Actually, what's the point now\nDesirée:\n...What is it, honey? I did my best for you, Ronnie!\nRon:\nI-I know that and I appreciate it, Dessie... But the thing is...\nGodot:\nCome on... Give the kid some time. He's just got a little touch of the blues. You know about feeling blue, right, amigo?\nPhoenix:\nM-Mr. Godot! What are you doing here!?\nGodot:\nOh come on! I just came here to say thanks to my newest buddy... ...You, Mr. Trite.\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe you should learn my name before you call me \"buddy\"...)\nGodot:\nWell, playtime is over.\nPhoenix:\nHuh...?\nGodot:\nEarly this morning... the body of Kane Bullard was discovered.\nMaya:\nKane Bullard...? Where have I heard that name before?\nDesirée:\nIsn't that... the name of the CEO of KB Security?\nMaya:\nWait. B-Body...!? (Changed from [B-Body...?] in the original release)\nGodot:\nThe estimated time of death was 1 AM on October 12th.\nPhoenix:\n1 AM on October 12th...? Y-You don't mean!?\nGodot:\n...That's right, amigo. At the same time that a cheap little urn was being stolen... ...the CEO of KB Security was being murdered.\nPhoenix:\nS-So then... What are you doing here?\nGodot:\nOh come on. You've figured it out already, haven't you amigo? Or... Have you already forgotten about that piece of info I helped you out with today?\nPhoenix:\n(\"Helped me out\"? What!?)\nGodot:\nOn October 12th, at 1 o'clock in the morning... Ron DeLite was in the CEO's office... ...The scene of the murder. After getting that blackmail letter, he must have been imbrued with utter rage.\nMaya:\nWh-What are you saying!? Imbrued with rage...?\nGodot:\nCome on! Don't tell me you didn't know! (Changed from [Come on! Don't tell me you didn't know it!] in the original release) Ron DeLite was once an employee of KB Security... He was a professional security guard.\nPhoenix:\n(An employee of KB Security!?)\nGodot:\nIt looks like the alibi that saved him from being convicted as a thief... ...is going to be the noose that gets him hanged. Kind of an \"anti-alibi\".\nMaya:\nNo way...\nGodot:\nHe can't be the thief because he was at the murder scene when the murder occurred!\nDesirée:\nN-No! Th-That's a lie! It can't be true!\nRon:\nOh! Ohhhh! B-But I... I am a thief I tell you!\nGodot:\nRon DeLite. You're going back to prison again. This time the charge is much more serious. This time you'll be tried for murder.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What!? This can't... This is impossible!\nGodot:\nI'm looking forward to another exciting showdown, Mr. Trite!\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nYou and I aren't through with each other yet. Surely you won't back down from a challenge! You've never been a coward!\nPearl:\nMr. Nick! Is there something personal between you two...?\nGodot:\nI've returned from the depths of Hell to do battle with you. ...At least let me have some fun while I'm here!\nPhoenix:\n(This guy... Who the heck is he!? He may be quiet... But he's the most dangerous enemy I've ever faced...)\nGodot:\nWell then... Time to say goodbye to Mr. DeLite.\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nN-Nick...! How could this be happening?\nPhoenix:\nRight in front of our every eyes, our client has been arrested for murder. And the one who established his presence at the scene... was me.\nDesirée:\nEEEEEYYYAAAAHHH! R-RONNNIEEEEEEEE!\nPhoenix:\n(Arrested for murder on the very same day he's declared innocent of larceny... What the heck's going to happen next!?)\nTo be continued.\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?\nJudge:\nUh... I'm not sure I follow you.\nPhoenix:\nIt clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...\nJudge:\nYou don't sound very sure, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!\nJudge:\n...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Really?\nJudge:\nObjection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThis evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nHow exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related?\nPhoenix:\nThey aren't, are they...\nJudge:\nNot at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThe witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!\nJudge:\n... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh, I must be on the wrong track...?)\nToo many penalties\nJudge:\nThat's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for mis-interpretation of the facts. This court finds the defendant, Ron DeLite...\nGuilty\nJudge:\nThe accused will surrender to the court immediately... ...to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. This court is adjourned!",

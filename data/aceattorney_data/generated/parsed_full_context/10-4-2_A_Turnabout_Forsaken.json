  "previousContext": "Episode 4A Turnabout Forsaken\nFrom here on cut, let the council begin! Let our members discuss this matter with a clear conscience of the Goddess of Law! Today's deliberation shall be about... Miles Edgeworth's aptitude and ability as a prosecutor!\nKay: Wh-Who are you...? Why are you wearing that raincoat...? Ah! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHhhhh!\nEdgeworth: Calm down. You're getting dust everywhere.\nGumshoe: I've already cleaned this room three times since this morning!\nEdgeworth: Well, now you'll need to do it a fourth time.\nGumshoe: You're way too calm, sir! What if they actually take your badge!?\nEdgeworth: A decision has not yet been made.\nGumshoe: But it looks like it's pretty much decided! Don't you remember what Judge Courtney said!?\nCourtney: Prosecutor Edgeworth, the P.I.C. has you in its sights. They will receive a report on everything you did here today... ...and you will most likely be required to appear before them.\nEdgeworth: I have been ordered to attend the meeting. ...That's all.\nGumshoe: I hate this, sir! I won't be able to work with you anymore!\nEdgeworth: As a detective, perhaps you should welcome this turn of events. You would no longer have to work with such a troublesome prosecutor as myself.\nGumshoe: Wh-Why would you say something like that, sir...? The problem is with the P.I.C. and their false accusations... Mr. Edgeworth... Don't tell me... you actually want to become a defense attorney?\nEdgeworth: ......\nGumshoe: B-Because you can't do that! Being a prosecutor is exactly what makes you Prosecutor Edgeworth, sir!\nEdgeworth: (...A defense attorney, huh? I became a prosecutor because of the incident where I lost my father... However, the reason I became interested in the legal world... ...was because my father who passed away... had been a defense attorney.)\nRay: To fight crime as a prosecutor, or to save people as a defense attorney. I want you to think carefully, about how you want to live your life from now on.\nGumshoe: Are you listening, sir!? I don't like this one bit!\nEdgeworth: There is no need for you to be so pessimistic. Maybe my replacement will be more lenient during your salary assessments.\nGumshoe: A-Ah, I see... That way, I can eat more than just instant noodles every day...! Wait, what am I saying!? That's not the point here!\nEdgeworth: (He was... actually imagining it.)\nGumshoe: We're busy right now! Come back later, pal!\n???: Paging Mr. Edgeworth. Is there a Mr. Miles Edgeworth here?\nGumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth is busy now! I'll listen to whatever you have to say later, pal!\n???: Hrmm... This isn't good! Your face has become all red. Errrm... A red face, a red face...\nGumshoe: Umm, like I said, we're kind of busy right now, so...\n???: I've got it! You have a tummy ache, right!? This calls for an injection, stat! Please roll up your sleeves!\nGumshoe: Aiiieeeee! Nonono, I'm perfectly healthy!\nEdgeworth: ...Who might you be?\nKarin: Aaaah, I'm so sorry! I forgot to introduce myself! My name is Karin Jenson. I am a registered nurse at the Dye-Young Hospital.\nEdgeworth: I'm sorry, but nobody here is sick. You must have the wrong room.\nKarin: Are you Mr. Miles Edgeworth? You have such great wrinkles between your brow... Could it be lupus? This calls for an injection...\nEdgeworth: I-It's not lupus! Just tell me what business you have with me!\nKarin: Ahh. Yes, yes. Actually, there's someone who would like to see you. Please wait a moment. I'll call them here right now!\nEdgeworth: Wait!\nGumshoe: She left, sir. I wonder who she's going to bring. Hmm, if she's bringing someone from the hospital... Could it be a patient, sir? Maybe it's someone who was traumatized by your harsh words...\nEdgeworth: What is that supposed to mean?\nGumshoe: S-See? When you glare at me like that, it feels like I'm going to have a heart attack. You could send someone to the hospital with that...\nEdgeworth: (I-Is it really that bad...? I'm just being my normal self, though.)\nKarin: Sorry for the wait! Well, what do you think?\n???: ........\nEdgeworth: What do I think...?\n???: Umm... Do you not recognize me?\nEdgeworth: (Now that she mentions it, I feel like I've met her before...)\n???: Umm... this card... Your name was written on it... Do you know who I am?\nGumshoe: M-Mr. Edgeworth... Maybe you really did send her to the hospital...\nEdgeworth: Of course not!\nGumshoe: But this is your business card, sir. It clearly says... \"Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth\".\nEdgeworth: Umm. Th-That's true...\n???: I-I am terribly sorry... I'm, umm, well...\nKarin: The truth is, this girl... suffers from memory loss.\nGumshoe: M... Memory loooosss?\n???: Yes... That seems to be the case.\nKarin: Ahh... Her parents should be worried sick right now... They probably haven't been able to sleep. I doubt they've gotten more than 8 hours...\nEdgeworth: (Isn't that plenty of sleep?)\nGumshoe: I see. It sure sounds horrible... but it's alright now! Since she has that business card, she must be an acquaintance of Mr. Edgeworth's. Just leave her to us, pal! Right, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth: Indeed... We might be able to verify her identity, at least.\n???: Would you... really do that for me?\nEdgeworth: First, I'd like you to tell us everything that you know.\nGumshoe: That's our Mr. Edgeworth! You have nothing to worry about now, Miss!\nEdgeworth: (Good grief...)\nEdgeworth: (But still, where to begin? What should I ask her first...?)\nGumshoe: Miss. Do you remember your name?\n???: My name...... I am terribly sorry.\nKarin: She's been like this ever since yesterday, y'know?\nEdgeworth: ...Hmm. So you found her yesterday.\nKarin: Wooow! That's amazing! How'd you know!?\nEdgeworth: (Wh... What a tiresome woman...)\nKarin: I found her stumbling around late last night, so I took her in. I wanted to help her out, so I looked through her things.\nEdgeworth: So, that's how you found my business card. Did she have anything else with her?\nKarin: Nothing to reveal her name or address... Ah! But! She was wearing this when I found her. It's an unusual design, don't you think?\nEdgeworth: Wha... Th-This badge is...\nGumshoe: Whaaaaaaat! Th-The Yatagarasu's...! That means... I-I-It couldn't be!\nEdgeworth: Are you Kay!?\n???: Kay......?\nYatagarasu's Badge data jotted down in my Organizer.\nKay: ...I'm really sorry. For not remembering you. Umm... What kind of relationship did we have?\nEdgeworth: Hmm. Well, that's... (Rather difficult to explain.)\nGumshoe: Kay, you were... Mr. Edgeworth's assistant!\nKay: Oh my! So then, a prosecutor is the kingpin of a Great Thief?\nGumshoe: Uh, no... That's not what I meant, pal...\nEdgeworth: (The last time I met \"Kay\" was the day before yesterday... Just what did she do from then up until now...?) Ms. Jenson, was the badge the only thing this girl had on her?\nKarin: She did have some other things, but I don't think they will be very helpful at all.\nEdgeworth: I don't mind. Please show them to me.\nKarin: Well then, I'll give them to you one by one, OK!\nGumshoe: This is a Jammin' Ninja mask. Maybe she went to a superhero show or something?\nEdgeworth: Hmm. This seems to be a letter addressed to Kay. This is a ticket stub. And this is...\nGumshoe: ...a flower made of cloth! Like the ones you usually see in restrooms, sir!\nEdgeworth: ...A corsage. It is used primarily as an accessory for women.\nKarin: Well, that's everything. Did you find anything out?\nGumshoe: Umm, not really. They were just a bunch of random things.\nEdgeworth: (I'll have to look them over in more detail later.)\nJammin' Ninja Mask data jotted down in my Organizer.\nLetter jotted down in my Organizer.\nTicket Stub data jotted down in my Organizer.\nPurple Flower data jotted down in my Organizer.\nGumshoe: Ooh.... This is horrible! Kay's lost her memory! How do we get her back to normal!?\nEdgeworth: Calm down, Detective. I have already thought of something.\nGumshoe: Oh! As I would expect of Mr. Edgeworth! So, what did you find out, sir?\nEdgeworth: Look at this ticket stub.\nKarin: Oh, it's a ticket for the viewing platform of the Grand Tower!\nGumshoe: Umm, Ms. Nurse? Do you know something about the Grand Tower?\nKarin: Of course I do! It's a super famous dating spot, after all! They say that if a couple holds hands up there, they will be together forever... Tee hee.\nEdgeworth: The time stamp on the ticket is from yesterday. Moreover, it is only valid on the day of issue.\nGumshoe: Since she only has the stub... she must have used it, right?\nEdgeworth: It is very likely. ...Well then, let's go.\nGumshoe: Ehh! Right now, sir?\nEdgeworth: The cause of Kay's memory loss is hidden in her actions.\nGumshoe: B-But... What about the P.I.C.!?\nEdgeworth: It's still too early for me to be summoned there.\nKarin: Errrm... So, should I leave Kay with you, then?\nEdgeworth: That is what I would prefer. Kay, you're fine with that, right?\nKay: Ah... Yes, please! Thank you very much!\nKarin: Well, I have to get back to work, so if anything happens, please contact the Dye-Young Hospital. If you guys need an injection, I'll be there anytime, please!\nEdgeworth: Yes. I understand. (I don't think I will call her for an injection, though.) Well then. Let's go, Detective. ...And you too, Kay.\nGumshoe: Yessir!\nKay: Thank you... for helping me.\nGumshoe: Umm. According to the pamphlet... ...this building is 50 stories tall. It's mostly filled with offices though... Only the viewing platform is open to the public. Here you go, sir. I just got this at the reception desk.\nEdgeworth: Good. Thank you.\nGrand Tower Pamphlet data jotted down in my Organizer.\nEdgeworth: Well then, let us head inside immediately...\nEeeek! The Grand Tower... The Grand Tower is collapsing!\nEdgeworth: Hm!\nGumshoe: Wh-What!?\n???: No, you can't! Please stop! Please... I beg of you! Ugh, it's no good. Unless I drink fresh milk, my thoughts just won't reach...!\nGumshoe: What's wrong, pal!? Did something happen at the Grand Tower!?\nCuuuuuut! Cut, cut, cut, cuuuut!\n???: E-Excuse me! We're sort of in the middle of shooting a movie, and umm...\nEdgeworth: (...Hmph. I suspected as much.) We are sorry for any trouble we've caused you. ...Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe: I-I'm so sorry, pal! I really thought the tower was gonna collapse or something...\n???: Whatever... Hey, director! I'm taking a break.\n???: I'm sorry... I'm really, really sorry!\nKay: What a relief... It looks like the tower's collapse was prevented somehow.\nEdgeworth: (Explaining all this to Kay as she is now would take more time than it's worth...) Well then. We should get going.\nGumshoe: Wow, what a view! I bet I can see my house from here!\nKay: Eek...! Th-The wind... is really strong up here.\nGumshoe: Everything should be fine as long as you stay close to me and Mr. Edgeworth, pal. If you start to blow away, one of us will be sure to catch you!\nEdgeworth: (It's not as if she's a kite!) Kay, do you recognize this place?\nKay: ...I-I don't know. Was I... really here?\nEdgeworth: (Maybe if I get her to talk a bit, it will help jog her memory...) Kay. Just tell me whatever you remember. Anything will do.\nKay: O-OK. But I don't know how much help I'll be...\nKay: Did I... really come to a place like this? It's so high up, and the wind is so strong... It's frightening. ...I just can't remember. I can't remember anything at all... .....I'm sorry. Just as I thought, it's impossible.\nGumshoe: Hmm. Her memory isn't clearing up at all, huh?\nKay: ...I'm so sorry. It's a bit pathetic, isn't it? You are both going out of your way for me, but I'm not helping at all.\nEdgeworth: You're doing just fine. You have memory loss, after all.\nGumshoe: Alright, Mr. Edgeworth! Remember to go easy on her, sir. Normally, you have this really intense and kind of scary look on your face.\nEdgeworth: (...You're not helping, Detective.)\nKay: Did I... really come to a place like this?\nKay: It's so high up, and the wind is so strong... It's frightening.\nKay: ...I just can't remember. I can't remember anything at all...\nKay: But... from under the cherry tree... I feel like... I saw something red.\nKay: Umm... That's right, someone was walking towards me from the other side of that stand.\nKay: .....I'm sorry. Just as I thought, it's impossible.\nEdgeworth: (There's not much I can do unless I can draw out more information from her... For now, I'll press her for more details and see what I can find out.)\nEdgeworth: So, you're saying that someone came from behind the stand... ...and walked directly towards you.\nKay: Yes. Someone came right up to me.\nEdgeworth: Then that \"someone\" must have been a ghost.\nKay: No, it was a person! I'm sure of it!\nEdgeworth: If this is where you were under the cherry tree, then someone behind the stand... ...wouldn't have any ground to stand on. They'd be floating in midair! No person should be able to stand there!\nKay: Eeeeek!\nKay: But... I... I'm not lying! Someone... red... Someone in red... was on the other side of the stand... They were walking towards me... Ahh... Getting closer and closer, and then... ...that person... that person... AAAAAAAAAHHHH!\nGumshoe: Wh-What's wrong!? Calm down! It's alright! Me and Mr. Edgeworth are both here for you, pal!\nKay: I-I... I was... pushed off. That person... in red... Yes, they were wearing a red raincoat...\nEdgeworth: (Someone in a red raincoat was walking in midair? And furthermore, they pushed her off this building? Nonsense. There is no way she could be alright after falling from a building this high!)\nKay's memories jotted down in my Organizer.\nOfficer: Attention, everyone! Please remain where you are!\nGumshoe: What's wrong, pal? I'm a detective! Tell me what's going on!\nOfficer: Sir! A body was just discovered in this building!\nGumshoe: A-A body!?\nEdgeworth: Who is the victim!?\nOfficer: We're currently investigating the details, but the victim is a woman! We have verified that her name is \"Kay\"!\nEdgeworth: What...\nGumshoe: WHAAAAAAAAT!?\nTo be continued.\nEdgeworth: (Th-This room is...!) Would this room happen to be...\nOfficer: Yes, sir! It's the Prosecutorial Investigation Committee's meeting room!\nGumshoe: Whaat! It's here!?\nEdgeworth: I had heard they recently moved out of the Prosecutor's Building. (But to think that they moved here of all places...)\nGrand Tower Pamphlet data updated in my Organizer.\nKarin: Mr. Edgeworth! Kay! What brings you here? How are you holding up?\nEdgeworth: We're in the middle of an investigation right now. Sorry, but who might this be?\nKarin: Ah! This is my Granny! Errm, let me just... \"Hi there sonny, the name's Bonnie Young. Who the heck are you?\" ...she says.\nEdgeworth: It is a pleasure to meet you. My name is Miles Edgeworth. I am a prosecutor. Ms. Jenson, isn't Young the name of...\nKarin: *ahem!* Granny is the director of the Dye-Young Hospital!\nEdgeworth: (This old lady... is the director?)\nKarin: \"Who're you callin' old!\" ...she says.\nEdgeworth: (...Sh-She can read my thoughts?)\nGumshoe: Oh! So that Granny is pretty important, huh?\nKarin: Ah ha ha! I wouldn't go that far... I mean, yes, she is. Aah, these people are... the patient's guardians. Y'know, the one with amnesia...\nEdgeworth: (Hmm. It seems she is a bit of an introvert.)\nKarin: \"Hey sonny, want me to cure that bad case of the frownies for you?\" ...she says.\nEdgeworth: ...!\nGumshoe: Ha ha ha! I'm afraid that's an incurable disease for Mr. Edgeworth, pal!\nKarin: Eh? Really, Granny? You want me to say that... \"I ain't got nothin' to say to you whippersnappers! You're free to do whatever you want. But you better not get in the way of my autopsy.\"\nEdgeworth: Please wait. We're...\nKarin: \"No means no!\"\nGumshoe: Hey, you don't have the right to decide that, pal!\nKarin: S-Sorry! Granny is the coroner, you see. And she's in charge of this case, so... Ouch! So, I'm very sorry, but that's the way it is.\nGumshoe: Whaddaya mean, \"that's the way it is,\" pal!?\nKarin: Well... Even if you ask me, I'm not the one who said it.\nGumshoe: I kinda feel like..... I'm watching a comedy act, sir.\nKarin: Well, we need to get back to the autopsy, so please excuse us! And take care!\nGumshoe: What was with her attitude!?\nEdgeworth: We received permission to investigate. There shouldn't be any problems.\nGumshoe: That atittude of hers is a huge problem, sir!\nKay: Mr. Edgeworth...? What do we do now?\nEdgeworth: We'll investigate the scene, of course. As a prosecutor, I cannot stand by and do nothing.\nKay: .........\nEdgeworth: Well then, let's begin.\nKay: But, the policeman said the dead person is also named \"Kay\"... Then, I'm pretty sure I'm not the Kay that you know, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth: We shall investigate that now. But... don't worry. There's no question that you are the Kay I know.\nKay: .....OK!\nEdgeworth: (An amnesiac Kay, and a corpse Kay... Both are connected to the Grand Tower. I'm certain that this case will lead me to Kay's lost memories!)\n(Examining bloodstain and talking to the officer leads to:)\n???: Excuse me.\nKarin: You are...? Oh, yes, what is it? \"That voice... It's Von Karma, right?\" Umm... Do you know her, Granny?\n???: Good to see you again, Doctor. And you as well, Miles Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth: Wh... (What is she doing here!? Franziska von Karma... She is a prosecutor working with Interpol, and the daughter of Manfred von Karma. She should be jetting around the world right now...)\nFranziska: Wherever there is a case, I will follow. National borders mean nothing before me!\nEdgeworth: Your presence here must mean that this case has international significance...\nFranziska: You know well enough that I'm chasing a smuggling ring. I shall recover all the stolen goods and crush that organization!\nEdgeworth: Then... does that mean the smuggling ring is also involved in this particular case?\nFranziska: ...Any further information is confidential. I am not obligated to speak of it with you.\nEdgeworth: ...! (So, it won't be that easy...)\nKarin: Umm, Ms. Franziska... von Karma? Granny says... \"The autopsy is complete. You're free to do what you want.\"\nEdgeworth: In that case, we would like to investigate as well.\nKarin: \"I've heard rumors about you! No way am I letting you near the body! You're the prosecutor who's about to get the boot. You best run on home now, sonny!\" Er, umm, just so you know, I wasn't the one who said that, OK?\nKay: P-Please, Granny. We need to investigate... No matter what.\nKarin: \"Hey, lassie! Who you callin' Granny!?\"\nKay: Eeek...! I-I'm sorry!\nEdgeworth: (We're not getting anywhere... I guess I have no other choice.) Franziska, please allow us to aid you in your investigation. We must examine that body in order to find out what happened to Kay!\nFranziska: To Kay Faraday...?\nGumshoe: I'm asking you too, sir! Kay's in really bad shape!\nFranziska: ......... I don't know what's going on... ...but fine, I'll grant you permission.\nEdgeworth: ...! You have my thanks.\nFranziska: Of course, I didn't say it would come without a price. You will explain everything to me later.\nGumshoe: We really owe you one, sir!\nFranziska: I wasn't talking to you, Scruffy!\nGumshoe: YEEEEOOWCH!\nFranziska: So that's how it is. If you would be so kind as to authorize them too, Doctor?\nKarin: \"I suppose it's fine if he's with a prosecutor from Interpol.\" ...Is what she says. And I fully agree with Granny.\nFranziska: By the Von Karma name, the entire world will be judged... That's just common knowledge.\nEdgeworth: (That's rather conceited for common knowledge...)\nKarin: \"Well, it's none of my beeswax anymore.\" ...Is what she says. Um, I hope you don't get in trouble for this.\nFranziska: You needn't worry. My reputation will not be shaken by something so petty.\nEdgeworth: (Unlike me, who is on the verge of losing his badge.)\n(Connecting all possible Logic, examining head, jacket, wounds, notebook, and candelabra, and deducing purple flower leads to:)\nEdgeworth: So, the victim's identity remains unknown...\nKay: Umm... Should you really still be calling \"Kay\"?\nGumshoe: Of course! What are you saying, pal!?\nKay: Th-Thank you. But then, what about that woman...?\nFranziska: She is someone who you may have killed. That's all we know.\nGumshoe: There's no way that's true! Right, Mr. Edgeworth!?\nEdgeworth: I... also do not believe you killed her.\nFranziska: You are such a naïve man, Miles Edgeworth.\n???: ♬ Here I come to save the dayyy!\nEdgeworth: (Hmm, that voice...)\nDebeste: ♬ So don't be afraid anymooore! For The Best Prosecutor is here todayyy! ♪\nCourtney: Pardon the interruption.\nDebeste: Mr. Edgeworth! Get away from the victim! I have inherited her dying wish! No one asked for YOU!\nEdgeworth: Hmm. Did you know the victim?\nCourtney: Just as I thought... The Goddess of Law will surely reveal the truth to us. So please, rest in peace.\nDebeste: That's right, Justine! Now that I'm here, everything will be A-OK. The culprit will rue the day he crossed paths with MYARGH!\nFranziska: Miles Edgeworth! Who is this fool of a man!?\nEdgeworth: (Wh-Why is she glaring at me!?)\nCourtney: You are Franziska von Karma, am I correct? I apologize for my late introduction. I am Justine Courtney. And the deceased individual is...\nDebeste: ...Attorney Jill Crane, one of the members of the Prosecutorial Investigation Committee!\nEdgeworth: (I see. So that's why she had the keycard...) I take it you're in charge of this case?\nDebeste: That's right! And with me in charge, this case is as good as solv- YEOOOWW!\nFranziska: That reminds me... I haven't caught your name yet.\nDebeste: If you just wanted to know my name, you didn't have to whi- YEAAAARGH!\nFranziska: Just state your name. I will not tolerate any unnecessary remarks.\nDebeste: Uuugh... Sebastian Debeste.\nEdgeworth: (It seems the pecking order has been decided.)\nKarin: Mr. Sebastian Debeste? Here, this is from Granny.\nDebeste: This is... the autopsy report! Wah hah hah... It seems you've been bested, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth: (This wasn't a competition to begin with...)\nKarin: \"My job is done. May we meet again in front of another corpse.\" OK, let's go home quickly, and eat some noodles! I'll be leaving too! Take care everyone!\nDebeste: ...The victim's head wound was postmortem.\nCourtney: Sebastian.\nDebeste: And the candelabra dealt the fatal blow. Estimated time of death is late last night... Wh-What is it, Justine?\nCourtney: While I do appreciate your enthusiasm, perhaps you should give your tongue a rest. You might pull a muscle.\nEdgeworth: (That would be painful indeed...)\nAutopsy Report jotted down in my Organizer.\nDebeste: Anyways, it's quite clear now! Kay Faraday must be arrested!\nGumshoe: Whaaaaaaat! What's the big idea, pal!?\nCourtney: It's just as he says, Detective. The culprit is Ms. Kay Faraday. The young lady in bandages over there... Although she's not wearing her usual attire... Are you not Ms. Kay Faraday?\nEdgeworth: ..... And what would you do if she is Kay? If you're going to arrest her... ...then I will resist by any means necessary. ...That, I guarantee you.\nCourtney: I am now convinced. The doubts surrounding your suitability as a prosecutor were indeed warranted.\nKay: It's fine, Mr. Edgeworth. You can go. Don't worry about me... I'll be fine.\nGumshoe: What are you saying, Kay!? You can't just go along with them, pal!\nKay: But, I... I don't remember anything. What if I really did kill that woman and then forgot about it? If that's true...\nCourtney: Acknowledgement is the Goddess' mercy. Atonement is her will. The Goddess of Law will surely praise you for your prudence!\nEdgeworth: Sebastian. And Judge Courtney... If you believe she is the culprit, on what basis do you make your accusations? Unless I'm completely convinced by your explanation... I will not obey your orders!\nDebeste: Fine, have it your way! Now, sit tight and listen to the perfect reasoning of Debeste!\nDebeste: I am the best in the world. No one else can do what I do. Yes! That's why I was the first to realize that Kay Faraday is the culprit! She broke into the meeting room in order to steal something. In other words, she's the only one who could have killed Ms. Crane!\nGumshoe: His logic's as awful as ever, sir.\nEdgeworth: (Harsh words... coming from you, Detective.) I asked for some basis to your claims, yet your reasoning has told me absolutely nothing...\nFranziska: ...However, we have no evidence to prove she didn't do it either.\nKay: ........\nGumshoe: Don't worry, Kay. I'm sure Mr. Edgeworth will pull off a miracle.\nEdgeworth: (Y-You think my deductions are some kind of miracle work...!?)\nFranziska: You'd better not disappoint me. Understand, Miles Edgeworth? Because if you do... this whip of mine won't stay silent.\nDebeste: I am the best in the world. No one else can do what I do.\nDebeste: Yes! That's why I was the first to realize that Kay Faraday is the culprit!\nDebeste: She broke into the meeting room in order to steal something.\nDebeste: In other words, she's the only one who could have killed Ms. Crane!\nEdgeworth: Good grief... There is a limit to how much you can falsely accuse someone.\nKay: It's fine, Mr. Edgeworth... You don't have to...\nEdgeworth: Fear not, Kay. The truth will be revealted soon enough.\nKay: Mr. Edgeworth...\nEdgeworth: (Kay couldn't have murdered Ms. Crane... If I can just prove that, she will be cleared of suspicion.)\nEdgeworth: It certainly sounds like... you are quite familiar with this room.\nDebeste: The Best man for the job should know all about The Best places.\nEdgeworth: Unfortunately, it seems that you are not The Best man for the job.\nDebeste: Are you mocking me!?\nEdgeworth: That's for you to decide. You didn't even know about this keycard, did you?\nDebeste: Of course I know about that! You need it to enter this room... ......... Huh? Was it really needed?\nFranziska: This foolish fool simply doesn't know when to give up!\nDebeste: YEEEOOOOOOWCH!\nEdgeworth: Sebastian, do you really suspect Kay?\nDebeste: Th-That's right! She's the only one who could have done it!\nEdgeworth: Well then, allow me to ask you... Since this room can only be entered by using a keycard... ...hoe did she enter the room without one!?\nDebeste: Gah...! W-Well, she probably used this and that, and... Nngh!\nEdgeworth: Oh? Did you pull a muscle? Allow me to explain then. The door could only be opened by members of the P.I.C. Which means...\nCourtney: Yes. That's correct.\nEdgeworth: Hm? (She... conceded so easily...?)\nCourtney: Take a look at this. It's a record of this room that I investigated just a while ago. At 12:52 AM, the door was opened using Ms. Crane's keycard.\nKeycard Record jotted down in my Organizer.\nCourtney: It's probable... ...that the killer entered the room together with the victim, Ms. Crane. After entering, the situation must have sourced, leading to the murder.\nEdgeworth: Your logic holds... but it is still merely conjecture. And it would imply that the killer and the victim were acquainted.\nGumshoe: No way, pal! Kay doesn't even know the victim!\nCourtney:\nCourtney: That is merely an assumption on your part... Unless you have any evidence to prove your claim? Evidence is everything, in court and at the crime scene. Without it, your argument is invalid.\nFranziska: In that case... I trust that you have evidence... ...to prove that Kay Faraday and the victim were connected.\nCourtney: ...Of course.\nEdgeworth: Wh... What!?\nCourtney: This letter... ...was discovered by Dr. Young in Ms. Crane's breast pocket.\nEdgeworth: (...The victim's belongings? Why did she withhold such vital evidence until now? Could it be... she was waiting for the perfect time to reveal it? Come to think of it...!)\nDebeste: And the candelabra dealt the fatal blow. Estimated time of death is late last night... Wh-What is it, Justine?\nCourtney: While I do appreciate your enthusiasm, perhaps you should give your tongue a rest. You might pull a muscle.\nCourtney: Hmhm... I'll read it for you. \"To Ms. Crane, Thank you so much for helping with my plan! I'm glad that we can help each other get what we want. It's like killing two birds with one stone! Please get revenge for 12 years ago!\" - Kay\" In other words, Kay Faraday and Ms. Crane were accomplices. They probably planned to steal something from this room.\nEdgeworth: P-Preposterous!\nFranziska: W-Wait! That means, the main culprit is...\nCourtney: It's still Kay Faraday, of course. It just means her crimes have increased by yet one more.\nVictim's Letter jotted down in my Organizer.\nKay: I'm... the main culprit...?\nGumshoe: Don't believe her, Kay! It's all a bunch of nonsense! There's no way Kay would do something like that!\nCourtney: Nonsense? Not at all. The evidence speaks for itself, wouldn't you agree?\nEdgeworth: Ngh...! (I knew that they wouldn't suspect Kay unless they had some sort of proof, but... ...to think they would actually have such decisive evidence!)\nDebeste: Nicely done, Justine!\nCourtney: Thank you very much.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth: Your explanation is still insufficient! I cannot accept such an argument!\nCourtney: Sebastian. Would you please leave this to me?\nDebeste: Alright, make sure you shut Mr. Edgeworth up once and for all!\nEdgeworth: (I can't allow their allegations to gain any more momentum. I must turn it around here!)\nCourtney: The relationship between Kay Faraday and Ms. Crane is as documented in the letter. She roped Ms. Crane into assisting her with her plan. However, for some reason, their partnership broke down. Ms. Crane was murdered... But with her dying breath, she managed to retaliate. Her parting gift is this letter, which she tucked safely away in her left breast pocket.\nGumshoe: H-Her testimony's even better than ever. Maybe the most perfect it's ever been, sir...! Are you gonna be alright, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth: Um, yes... Of course.\nFranziska: How unsightly, Miles Edgeworth. Save your stoic act for some other time.\nGumshoe: Ms. von Karma! Just whose side are you on!?\nFranziska: I'm on nobody's side, Scruffy. When searching for the truth, it's best not to take sides.\nGumshoe: W-Watch what you say, Ms. von Karma, or else Mr. Debeste is gonna...\nDebeste: \"Best\" you say? Well, I can tell you that the side I'm on is always the BYAAARGH!\nFranziska: ...How irritating.\nEdgeworth: Well, I suppose that's one thing we can agree on.\nCourtney: The relationship between Kay Faraday and Ms. Crane is as documented in the letter.\nCourtney: She roped Ms. Crane into assisting her with her plan.\nCourtney: However, for some reason, their partnership broke down.\nCourtney: Ms. Crane was murdered... But with her dying breath, she managed to retaliate.\nCourtney: Her parting gift is this letter, which she tucked safely away in her left breast pocket.\nEdgeworth: (I don't think that Kay wrote the letter... ...but unless I can draw out more information here, that thought means nothing. I should start by pressing her for more details.)\nEdgeworth: The victim held onto the truth until her dying breath... A truly touching story indeed.\nCourtney: The voices of the dead are soft. One must listen carefully to hear their dying wishes... And Ms. Crane has spoken: Kay Faraday is the culprit.\nEdgeworth: Hmph. Perhaps the voices you have been hearing are actually the whispers of the devil.\nDebeste: H-Hey! Don't make fun of Justine!\nEdgeworth: Let's listen to the voice of reason. Judge Courtney, please take a look at the autopsy report.\nCourtney: There is no need. I remember it perfectly. The victim was stabbed in the left breast...! N-No, it can't be...!\nEdgeworth: The letter was found in the victim's left breast pocket.\nGumshoe: And that's where the victim was stabbed with the candelabra, right, sir?\nEdgeworth: Precisely. It wouldn't have been possible to stab her there without piercing the letter as well!\nCourtney: .....!\nEdgeworth: So, that begs the question... Why was the letter found in the victim's pocket? It's simple. It was placed there after the victim was murdered to throw suspicion onto Kay! Somebody intentionally wanted to create this very situation! In other words, there exists the possibility that the letter was forged by the true culprit!\nCourtney: Noooooooo!\nEdgeworth: The real murderer tried to pin the crime on Kay... That is the only explanation for the letter.\nGumshoe: And in doing so, the murderer ended up digging their own grave, right, sir?\nDebeste:\nDebeste: The culprit is Kay Faraday! The letter was... Yeah! It was actually found in the victim's other pocket!\nGumshoe: ...Huh? What're you saying, pal?\nDebeste: The officer's report was wrong when he said the letter was in her left pocket! It's actually in the... YEOOOWWCH!\nFranziska: A foolish fool who continues to make a fool of himself... Is there no cure for your foolishness!?\nDebeste: Why do you keep whipping me!? And quit calling me a fool! YEAAARGH!\nFranziska: I saved you the trouble of punishing him yourself.\nEdgeworth: I-Indeed... (Though I had no intention of punishing him...) The letter is stained with blood, no doubt because it was found in the left breast pocket. There couldn't have been an error in the officer's report... Unless you were the investigator.\nDebeste: U-Ugghh... Say something, Justine!\nCourtney: ........\nEdgeworth: I see you have no objections. ...Then allow me to continue. There is one more potential suspect in this case.\nDebeste: Don't be ridiculous! The killer entered this very room! There wasn't anyone else who did that besides Kay Faraday and the victim!\nEdgeworth: (To enter the meeting room, one needs a keycard... And their reasoning assumes that the murderer and the victim entered the room together. This is what we overlooked. If we just discard that assumption, then...) This evidence reveals the other suspect besides Kay...!\nEdgeworth: This is the keycard record Judge Courtney handed me earlier. The victim's keycard was used at 12:52 AM... And there was one more person who also used a keycard.\nFranziska: So you're saying this person was waiting to ambush the victim inside the meeting room? The keycard was used at 10:15 PM. I wouldn't say it's possible...\nCourtney: No, it's impossible.\nGumshoe: And what makes you say that, pal!? You got any proof!?\nCourtney: Of course I do. I myself am that proof.\nEdgeworth: ...!\nCourtney: I was the one who used that keycard, after all.\nKeycard Record updated in my Organizer.\nCourtney: Is there something strange about a P.I.C. remeber entering the P.I.C. meeting room?\nEdgeworth: Hmph. That proves nothing. The fact that you were in here at all makes you a suspect. Or do you perhaps have any evidence that you didn't kill your colleague?\nCourtney:\nCourtney: Such nonsense. What would I gain by murdering her?\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth: Allow me to reiterate what you said earlier. I'm sure it will all become clear upon further investigation.\nCourtney:\nCourtney: Why would I, a faithful servant of the law, commit a crime? True enough, I entered this room. However, that alone is not reason enough to suspect me of a crime.\nEdgeworth: If that's the case, please tell me why you entered this room.\nCourtney: I had some business to take care of, and some preparations had to be made.\nGumshoe: Preparations...! That sounds pretty suspicious, pal!\nCourtney: Unfortunately, I cannot disclose what these preparations were. However... I'm sure you could hazard a guess, \"Prosecutor\" Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth: (...So she was preparing for my hearing. She must have gathered all the necessary materials... ...to take away my Prosecutor's Badge.)\n???: Wonderful, wonderful. It's good to see young people go head-to-head so ruthlessly.\nEdgeworth: (Who is that...?)\n???: That takes me back. When I was young, I'd always butt heads with this brash detective. ...A-And then one day... ...He just disappeared. I hope... he's still doing well... Ahh, h-here come the waterworks.\nCourtney: Chairman Debeste...!\nEdgeworth: (Did she just say... Debeste?)\n???: Hello, Courtney. You sure are full of energy today. And if it isn't little Von Karma. Look how much you've grown since I last saw you.\nFranziska: S-Sir... It has been quite a while...\n???: ...A curtsy? You don't have to treat me like some sort of stranger, y'know. Remember back in the old days, when you'd sit on my lap and call me Unky Boo Boo? *sniff* ...Here I go again. Oh... How I cried b-back then...\nDebeste: Pops! What are you doing here!?\n???: Hrm? A member of the P.I.C. was killed and I heard that you were in charge of the case.\nGumshoe: ...What kind of prosecutor is followed around by his own father?\nCourtney: Hold your tongue! Do you have any idea who this man is? Chairman of the P.I.C., former Chief Prosecutor. He's the right hand of the Goddess of Law.\n???: Now, now, Courtney. I'm just an old chunk of coal. There's no reason to speak so highly of me.\nEdgeworth: Please excuse my subordinate's behavior. I am...\nBlaise: Prosecutor Edgeworth, isn't it? Along with his trusty sidekick Dick Gumshoe. I am Blaise Debeste. I'm the proud father of that idiot over there. When that boy was born, me and the missus were happy as can be, y'see... But now... I-I don't even know where she's gone to... *sob*\nDebeste: P-Pops... You need a handkerchief?\nBlaise: Ah, yes. Sebastian is an idiot, but he's such a good boy, y'know.\nEdgeworth: (Quite the doting father and son.)\nBlaise: Now then, Courtney. How's the investigation going?\nCourtney: Sir. We've established that the culprit is Kay Faraday. We are currently focusing our efforts...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth: There are too many uncertainties in this case! It's impossible to determine that she's the culprit! Surely you haven't forgotten the matter of the letter!\nDebeste:\nDebeste: I already told you, it was just a simple mistake. The letter was in another pocke- YEOWCH!\nFranziska: ...You talk too much.\nBlaise: Now, now. Let's all play nice. Everyone, just calm down.\nCourtney: ...I'm sorry that you had to witness such an unsightly scene, Mr. Chairman.\nBlaise: Don't apologize Courtney. I can follow everyone's logic. ...Except Sebastian's, that is.\nDebeste: H-Hey! Pops...\nEdgeworth: Chairman Debeste, I am a prosecutor. My duty is to bring criminals to justice. However, I won't make someone out to be a criminal without sufficient motive and evidence.\nBlaise: Hrm, I've heard about you and your relationship with the suspect, y'know. Ah, to share such a strong bond...\nEdgeworth: ......\nGumshoe: Kay has assisted the police in arresting criminals countless times, pal!\nEdgeworth: There are too many facets of this case that remain unexplored...!\nBlaise: I see. The bonds of youth are a wonderful thing, indeed. ...But, that is that and this is this. Y'know?\nGumshoe: What's that supposed to mean!?\nBlaise: The Prosecutor's Office needs to resolve this case as quickly as possible. I mean, just think of all the other cases that are piling up. There's no time to waste here. It's unfortunate, but... you understand, right, Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth: What...!?\nBlaise: Now then, Kay Faraday. I'd like to arrest you now.\nKay: .....Okay.\nGumshoe: No! I won't let you! Kay's innocent, pal!\nCourtney: To defy Chairman Debeste, is to defy the law. It would be a grave act of disloyalty. In other words, a hearing won't be needed. Are you prepared to lose your Prosecutor's Badge?\nGumshoe: Th-That's...! Mr. Edgeworth's badge...! You can't do that!\nFranziska: ...Using a prosecutor's badge as a shield. What has the P.I.C. come to...?\nEdgeworth: Kay...! You haven't done anything wrong!\nKay: Mr. Edgeworth... It was only for a short time, but... Thank you for everything... I'm sorry... I turned out to be a criminal...\nCourtney: We will make sure to impart your confession to the Goddess of Law.\nEdgeworth: .....Nngh! (What... should I do!? When I was young, I wanted to become a defense attorney like my father... Someone who can fight to save those in need...! And right now... this badge is holding me back. A mere badge, for the life of a dear friend... I don't even have to consider it...!)\nKay: ...Alright. Farewell... Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth: Hold it right there! Judge Courtney!\nCourtney: ...What is it now, Prosecutor Edgeworth? ! This is... your prosecutor's badge! Prosecutor Edgeworth! What is the meaning of this!?\nEdgeworth: ...Consider this my resignation. I am... no longer a prosecutor!\nKay: M... Mr. Edgeworth...?\nFranziska: Wh-What are you doing!? Explain yourself! Miles Edgeworth! You... you can't be serious!?\nGumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth! You... you're joking, right? If you aren't a prosecutor, then I...!\nEdgeworth: My only mission is to bring the truth to light. If it's the prosecutor's path to turn a blind eye to the truth... ...then that title is worth nothing to me! I... will walk in the path that I believe in. ...I will not be stopped here!\nFranziska:\nFranziska: You, you're running away from Von Karma... from me!?\nEdgeworth: .....No matter what you say, I don't intend to go back on my decision.\nFranziska: So... you're leaving me behind again!? I'll never... Never forgive you for this!\nKay: N-No... This is all my fault...! ...I'm sorry. If only I weren't here...\nEdgeworth: Wait! Kay! Detective Gumshoe! Don't follow me!\nGumshoe: B-But! Mr. Edgeworth...! Boss...!\nEdgeworth: ...I'm not your \"boss\" anymore, Detective.\nGumshoe: Th-That's...! That's just too much, sir! It's always been you and me! We've always been a team!\nEdgeworth: Detective Gumshoe, you no longer need to follow my lead. You... should try to accomplish whatever you can on your end!\nGumshoe: .....!\nBlaise: Ahh, ahh, this is bad. We just let a dangerous criminal escape. How could I let her get away... and after all my hard work... Y'see...\nCourtney: Rest assured, Mr. Chairman. This area will be locked down immediately.\nBlaise: Good. I expect the best from you, Courtney.\nCourtney: ......\nTo be continued.\nEdgeworth: Kay! (She's not here either. Where in the world could she have gone...?)\nRay: Knock knock, I'm here.\nEdgeworth: Mr. Shields...!\nRay: What's going on, Miles? Why the long face...? Take it from Uncle Ray, you won't be popular with the ladies looking like that.\nEdgeworth: Why are you here? Did something happen?\nRay: That's my line. Have you seen the news? About the murder at the P.I.C. headquarters? Your hearing... Wasn't it there today? I found myself wondering if you guys had somehow got caught up in it.\nEdgeworth: Wait, it's already made the news?\nRay: I hear they're searching for a teenage girl suspected of killing an attorney... I can't imagine it could have been her, but... it has been bothering me. Could you give me the full rundown?\nEdgeworth: Th-The truth is...\nRay: M-Miles, are you trying to give your Uncle Ray a heart attack?\nEdgeworth: I'm not joking. She really did lose her memory...\nRay: On top of that, she's a suspect... That make things even difficult. Where would she have run off to? She lost her memory, right?\nEdgeworth: I was hoping she would return here, but...\nRay: Not likely. She felt responsible for what happened to you, right? Then, there's no way she would come back here.\nEdgeworth: I know that! But, where else can I look...?\nRay: Calm down, Miles. This isn't like you. It's rare to see you get so heated up. Well... not that it's a bad thing. If you're trying this hard to save an innocent suspect from false charges... ...I'm sure you'd make a great defense attorney.\nEdgeworth: Actually... just a while ago... I turned in my badge... ...but that doesn't mean I've decided to become a defense attorney. Besides, Kay isn't just a mere suspect. I may have only known her for a short time... but we've been through quite a lot together. And I know she isn't capable of murder!\nRay: ...I'm surprised. I never thought you would go so far to support someone else. I don't know if you even realize it yourself, but... ...it seems a deep bond has already begun to grow between you and Kay. I'd say it even gives my bond with your father a run for its money.\nEdgeworth: No... It's not that deep. She just keeps barging into my state of affairs.\nRay: Ha ha. Yeah, that girl can be quite a handful. But I'm certain that something has changed inside you since you met her.\nEdgeworth: ......\nRay: I'm really jealous, you know. After all, I lost my old partner. That's why you need to find Kay right now. I don't want you to lose your bond like your Uncle Ray did...\nEdgeworth: ......\nRay: Well then, I have a proposal. We have no idea where she is. And searching around blindly won't get us anywhere. In that case... why don't we try searching for the cause of her memory loss? Maybe that could give us a lead?\nEdgeworth: I see... That might be a good idea. From what she told me, something must have happened to her at the Grand Tower...\nRay: Great, that's it! Let's get going then! Hey. At the very least, could you stop looking so grim? If you stay that way, Kay probably won't want to come back at all.\nEdgeworth: .....Good grief. (I'm not match for this man...)\nEdgeworth: (It seems it's already dark...)\nRay: Still open on the day of a murder. You gotta admire their capitalist spirit... But there's no one here.... Looks like we've got the place all to ourselves.\nEdgeworth: (To prove Kay's innocence, I'll need to investigate her lost memories...!)\nRay: Hey, hey! Let's go, Miles! We can investigate the roof as much as we want! So let's do what we can.\nEdgeworth: Do what we can, huh? I suppose that's all we can do for now.\n(Moving to the center of map after examining cherry tree and railing and talking to Karin leads to:)\nKay: Aaaaah! Oww...\nEdgeworth: Kay.\nKay: Um, um... Don't mind me! I was just admiring the view beneath the tree!\nEdgeworth: ...Did you just fall out of that tree?\nKay: I didn't mean to fall! ...My foot slipped.\nEdgeworth: You're a suspect, and yet you remained at the crime scene... That's not a smart thing to do. Even if you have memory loss, shouldn't you have realized this much? This whole time, while you were playing this silly game of hide-and-seek... ...I've been worried sick about you.\nKay: ...Are you angry with me?\nEdgeworth: ...Of course I am. Answer me. What were you doing here?\nKay: .....\nEdgeworth: Did you think I'd let you off the hook that easily just because you have memory loss?\nKay: Th-That's not it!! ...I came here because I thought I could get your badge back.\nEdgeworth: ...What?\nKay: If I don't regain my memories, you'll never get it back... I thought if I went back to where I lost my memories, then maybe I would remember... If I could just remember... killing her...\nEdgeworth: .......... .....Heh.\nKay: ?\nEdgeworth: ...You're still the same as you were before you lost your memories. Your thoughts and actions have always exceeded my expectations. Without a doubt, you are the Kay Faraday I know so well... However... I cannot approve of your recklessness.\nKay: ...I understand.\nRay: Cuuuuut! You get zero style points, Miles. Or more like, negative points! Here's how it's done. Kay, how about a hug?\nKay: O... Okay.\nRay: Oho! Well, then...\nEdgeworth: Mr. Shields!\nRay: It was just a joke. Honest!\nAnnouncer: We interrupt this program with breaking news about the Grand Tower murder case... The police believe the culprit is a teenage girl who was present at the crime scene. She remains at large as the police continue to search for her whereabouts.\nKay: ...!\nRay: Oh dear... This is getting pretty serious. Well, gang, what's the plan? We don't have much time.\nEdgeworth: Indeed. It's only a matter of time before they find us here.\nRay: So then, why don't you tag along with us for a while, Kay?\nKay: But, I'll just cause trouble for you again...\nEdgeworth: It pains me to say this but I've got nothing left to lose at this point.\nKay: Mr. Edgeworth...!\nRay: This settles it. We're all in this together now. Miles, you're in charge of proving Kay's innocence. Failure is not an option.\nEdgeworth: Yes. I understand.\nRay: Kay, I want you to help Miles with his investigation as much as you can!\nKay: Y-Yes! I'll do my best.\nRay: Let's be quick about it! Before the cops find us here! Unlike some people, Uncle Ray still has a lot to lose! Sheesh... If I lose the law office, I'll never be able to face Gregory...\nEdgeworth: (This man... I'm glad he's on our side.)\nEdgeworth: An extra floor between the 50th floor and the viewing platform... Why didn't anyone notice it?\nRay: Normally, you'd notice it. I mean, how can you hide an entire floor?\nEdgeworth: That is where the problem lies. No one noticed something that should have been easily noticeable. In other words, it must be impossible to access the 51st floor through normal means!\nKay: I see. Maybe there's a secret portal or something!\nRay: Kay... Now's not the time to be thinking with portals.\nEdgeworth: I'd like you to recall the hatch at the base of the cherry tree. Isn't it normal to assume there's a room on the other side of the maintenance hatch?\nRay: Heh heh... Uncle Ray likes where you're going with this.\nKay: Let's hurry and check it out.\nRay: There... we go. Now let's see...\nEdgeworth: This is...!\nKay: Looks like there's a lot of stuff down there. Is this what they call... a storeroom?\nEdgeworth: There is no doubt about it. This is where Kay fell down.\nRay: Of course. And with this the mystery is solved!\nEdgeworth: No, not yet. (We still have the mystery of the person in the red hood who was walking in mid-air...)\nRay: Now, now. Let's not get greedy, shall we? We've found the storeroom, so let's wrap things up here.\nEdgeworth: I suppose... you have a point. (Hmm. It does seem to warrant an investigation.)\n???: Well, if it isn't Miles Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth: Ema! What are you doing here?\nEma: I heard about the case from Detective Gumshoe! Since I was already in the area, I thought I might as well check out the crime scene!\nEdgeworth: (This girl's name is Ema Skye. She's a high school student studying in Europe to become a forensic scientist. She's the younger sister of my former boss, and a witness in one of my trials two years ago.)\nEma: Detective Gumshoe told me everything over the phone! He sounded really upset! He said you lost your badge at the Grand Tower, and Kay became a mummy!\nEdgeworth: P-Please calm down. I thought you left for Europe just a few days ago... Don't tell me you've come back already?\nEma: Yep! And I've brought my teacher from abroad too. He needed an interpreter, so I volunteered to help.\nEdgeworth: If your teacher cannot speak English, why aren't you with him right now?\nEma: He can still communicate with people! Don't underestimate the importance of body language!\nEdgeworth: (...That doesn't really count as a language.)\nEma: But enough about that! What happened to Kay!? Is she alright!?\nRay: My, my, what a good friend. Isn't this great, Kay?\nKay: Y-Yeah...\nEma: Umm, who are you? Are you Mr. Edgeworth's new assistant?\nRay: Ha ha ha! On the contrary, my dear. I'm Ray Shields, head of the Edgeworth Law Offices.\nEma: Edgeworth... Law Offices? Wait, you mean like defense attorneys!? Mr. Edgeworth, when did you suddenly become an attorney!?\nEdgeworth: N-No, it's not like that... (Now that I think about it, it is a rather complicated working relationship.)\nRay: Don't sweat the details. Let's start with an introductory hug...\nEma: Why'd you become a defense attorney, Mr. Edgeworth!?\nRay: Hey, don't just ignore me...\nEma: Because I don't approve at all!\nEdgeworth: Uh. Hm... Well, why don't we continue this conversation down below?\nKay: That's right. The police could arrive any second now.\nEma: ...? Mr. Edgeworth, who's she?\nEdgeworth: I'll explain later. First, we have to go down the hatch.\nEma: Ah, OK. Guess I'll be joining the prosecu- err... defense team?\nEdgeworth: ...I'll explain about that, too.\nRay: Well then! Let's go go go to the storeroom!\nTo be continued.\n\n",

I can't see a thing!\nEdgeworth:\nWatch your footing, Ema.\nEma:\nOuch! I think I hit my head...\nEdgeworth:\nKay, be careful not to slip. Take your time coming down.\nKay:\nAh... OK!\nRay:\nHmmm... The light switch should be somewhere around here!\nEdgeworth:\nTh... This is! (The hidden 51st floor... Is it being used as a storeroom? We'll need to investigate it thoroughly.)\nGrand Tower Pamphlet data updated in my Organizer.\nEma:\nMr. Edgeworth! Please tell me about the case!\nEdgeworth:\nRight then, where should I begin...?\nEma:\nI see... This is certainly a serious situation!\nEdgeworth:\n(Why does she look like she's having so much fun...)\nEma:\nHeh heh heh... looks like you're in a bind, Prosecutorial Attorney Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\n...I'm not a defense attorney. Nor is there such thing as a \"Prosecutorial Attorney.\"\nEma:\nThis looks like a job for science! Don't worry. I've got everything here in my bag.\nEdgeworth:\nAre you sure you're up for this, Ema?\nEma:\nOf course! So, once again... ...it's good to be working with you, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nAnd I'm glad to be working with you, as well.\nRay:\nLooks like we've got ourselves another cute assistant. ...So, what's the plan?\nEma:\nThat lift looks pretty suspicious to me!\nRay:\nIt... looks like it goes down?\nEdgeworth:\nI am curious as well... But first, we should investigate this room.\nRay:\nOK. If you find out anything, be sure to tell Uncle Ray.\nKay:\nAnd if I remember something, I'll let you know.\nEdgeworth:\nYes, please do. ...Ema.\nEma:\nRoger! I'm ready to support!\nEdgeworth:\nWell then... let's begin the investigation.\nBegin Investigation\nGrand Tower51st Floor Storeroom\nLogic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Prices\" and \"Big bucks\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nFrom the price tags attached to the pieces of evidence, and that huge stash of cash... ...it's clear that buying and selling of evidence was being carried out here.\nEma:\nIn the hidden 51st floor, evidence was being trafficked! This clearly means something!\nEdgeworth:\nIt seems further investigation is needed... ...about the dealings that went on in this place.\nEma:\nIf only there was a witness, we could just ask them.\nEdgeworth:\n(A witness...?)\nPartner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEma:\nAsk me anything you want!\n\n\n\nNotice anything?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEma:\nSince Kay's the suspect, I can't just stay silent!\nEdgeworth:\nI feel the same way. For now, we should calm down and search for clues.\nEma:\n...No. After thinking it through scientifically, I've come up with an even better plan! I'll just give Kay an extremely powerful electric shock to her head... ...and see if that will jump start her memories!\nEdgeworth:\nUmm... W-Well. That seems a bit, no, quite dangerous. I would prefer to go with my proposal to calm down and investigate this room.\nEma:\nIs that so? But in science, a bit of danger always comes with the territory...\nEdgeworth:\n(That's not exactly what you would call \"a bit of danger\"!)\n\n\n\n\nEma Skye\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEma:\nI came back here for a while as my teacher's translator, but normally I study in Europe. That's right! To become a super forensic scientist!\nEdgeworth:\nThat's admirable. Endeavoring to learn is the duty of a student.\nEma:\nYes! In order to excel in both academics and athletics, I've even taken up sports. For example, the competitions they have during Sports Day!\nEdgeworth:\n(...Oh? I wonder what sort of competitions she's referring to?)\nEma:\nUnlike America, Europe has extremely tough, manly sports, and... Well, I'm sure you've heard of the \"War of the Eyeglasses\" at least.\nEdgeworth:\n(I've never heard of it before in my life...)\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYatagarasu's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEma:\nThis is Kay's badge, right?\nEdgeworth:\nYes. This is her precious badge. ...Though she doesn't seem to remember it herself.\nEma:\nIs that so...? Hmm. Maybe it doesn't have enough impact? How about I customize that badge a bit? Let's spruce it up a little with pink ribbons and white feathers!\nEdgeworth:\nI appreciate the offer, but... let's keep it like this for now. (Kay's memories would only become even more confused.)\n\n\n\n\nKay's Memories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEma:\nI wonder why Kay lost her memories? Maybe she saw something really shocking...\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed... She seems to have gotten herself involved in a murder case, after all.\nEma:\nI also went through some pretty scary things in the past, as well... ...but thanks to my sister and everyone else who saved me, I can be who I am today. Mr. Edgeworth! We're definitely going to save Kay, OK!?\nEdgeworth:\n...Yes, of course.\n\n\n\n\nStuffed Animal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nDo you like this sort of thing, Ema?\nEma:\nWell... Between the fabric, the texture, and the weight, I find this item quite fascinating! Judging from the damage to the fur, it would appear that this was made quite a long time ago!\nEdgeworth:\nUmm, didn't you say it was \"cute\" earlier...?\nEma:\nI do think it's cute. But that's a different matter entirely!\nEdgeworth:\n(I don't understand how that's different at all.)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEma:\nScientifically speaking, I'd have to say that the details are unknown.\nEdgeworth:\nSo, in plain English... You don't know anything about it, right?\nEma:\nIt's not that I don't know. It's just that the details! Are unknown!\nDesk on the left\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nTh-These are...\nEma:\nWh-What is it?\nEdgeworth:\nThe items displayed on this shelf here, if I recall correctly... ...they're all evidence from past cases that I was involved with. What are they doing here...?\nEma:\nHmm. I guess that would make this place the P.I.C.'s evidence storeroom, huh?\nEdgeworth:\nThese items should be kept in the care of the police.\nEma:\nDon't they keep evidence in the Prosecutor's Office?\nEdgeworth:\nOnly for current trials. However, once a verdict has been reached... ...the evidence is transferred over to the police department, and stored in the evidence room.\nEma:\nBut it looks like the evidence has been stored here instead...\nEdgeworth:\n(There's no point in worrying about it. For now, I should try examining everything.) It looks like some of evidence have tags in front of them. And there are numbers written on the tags.\nEma:\nMaybe they're the ID numbers of the evidence?\nEdgeworth:\nNo. Based on how large these numbers are and the nature of these items, I'd say... ...these are prices (Prices - Prices are attached to the piece of evidence. They seem rather high.).\nEma:\nP-Prices! If that's the case... ...Wow! These are ridiculously expensive!\nEdgeworth:\n(She seems more concerned with the high prices than the legality of this whole affair...)\n\n\n\nBefore examining stuffed animal and deducing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(The evidence on display... I should inspect every nook and cranny.)\n\n\n\n\nAfter examining stuffed animal and deducing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)\n\n\n\n\nStar-shaped mark\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEma:\nThat's strange. Only this one spot is empty. But it still has a price tag, just like all the others...\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. Furthermore, there is a part of this cloth that is not covered in dust. Perhaps something was placed here not so long ago?\nEma:\nI see! It sure seems like it. Hmm, but... ...what could it have been?\nEdgeworth:\n(This star-shaped mark in the dust. I wonder... Could it be related to a certain piece of evidence?)\n\n\n\n\nStar-shaped mark (after deducing)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEma:\nThe murder weapon was placed here, right? This storeroom... sure is a scary place.\nEdgeworth:\nHowever, Ema, at the same time... ...it also means this spot is deeply tied to the case.\nEma:\nThe spirit of inquiry is the cornerstone of science! Let's inspect every nook and cranny. ...Just not the scary places!\n\n\n\n\nStuffed animal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEma:\nAwww, how cute! This stuffed animal is so fluffy!\nEdgeworth:\nThat's from Gourd Lake. (It should be in the care of the prosecutor assigned to that case right now... Why is it sitting here in a place like this?)\nEma:\nHuh? This little guy's missing his left horn!\nEdgeworth:\nHmm. His left horn... I'm pretty sure it was already missing when I first saw it.\nEma:\nThen, this must be a defective product. I demand a recall!\nEdgeworth:\n(Now that I think about it... ...giving a broken toy to a country's president does sound strange.)\n\n\n\nFirst time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStuffed Animal data jotted down in my Organizer.\nEma:\nThis storeroom contains items to be sold, doesn't it?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's unfortunate, but the possibility seems quite high. I suspect some nefarious individual has been selling evidence here.\nEma:\nAnd people actually pay money for this stuff?\nEdgeworth:\n...Apparently, some people do. The price tags are proof.\nEma:\nDifferent strokes for different folks, I guess...\n\n\n\n\n\nLamp and ink\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nInk... and a lamp. Both are evidence that I've handled before.\nEma:\nWhy is all this stuff here linked to you?\nEdgeworth:\nMany of the items here are objects that I've handled just a short while ago. But it's probably only a coincidence that they're all collected here.\nEma:\nA coincidence!? I never thought I'd hear you say that word, Mr. Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nNo matter how improbable, if it fits with the facts, then we must accept it as the truth... Isn't that the same with science?\nEma:\nAha! We should discuss science in detail some day, Mr. Edgeworth!\n\n\n\n\nIron Infant doll\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEma:\nWhat a cute doll. It kinda looks like the Steel Samurai.\nEdgeworth:\n(It's the Iron Infant, son of the Steel Samurai and the Pink Princess... He was destined to become a hero of justice from the moment of his birth. So much pressure rests on his tiny baby shoulders. And yet, he carries himself with a grace and dignity that belies a toddler of his age.)\nEma:\n...Hello! Mr. Edgeworth! Are you even listening to me?\nEdgeworth:\nHm? O-Of course I am!\n\n\n\n\nSmall bottle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt's a small bottle. I've seen this piece of evidence before in the past.\nEma:\n.....Huh? Is that all?\nEdgeworth:\nUh. Yes. What more did you want me to say?\nEma:\nUmm, I need to make a memo. Note to self... Even the most boring objects sound like works of art when Mr. Edgeworth describes them.\nEdgeworth:\n(Ngh...! Don't read a memo like that out loud!)\n\n\n\n\nMannequin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEma:\nThis mannequin... I've got it! According to my scientific reasoning... ...this is something you encountered in one of your past cases, right!?\nEdgeworth:\n...No, it's not. This is the first time I've seen this mannequin. (It seems completely unrelated to the other objects in this room. There's no price tag in front of this mannequin either. So then, why is it here?)\n\n\n\n\nDeduce\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?)\n\n\n\nDeduce star-shaped mark and present Candelabra\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This dust pattern... matches up perfectly with the base of the candelabra!\"\n\n\n\n\nOtherwise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nEma, please observe the state of this area.\nEma:\nOh! Scientifically speaking, you've found something, right!?\nEdgeworth:\nYes. Wouldn't you say this spot is connected to the evidence?\nEma:\nHmm... I would say no, wouldn't you?\nEdgeworth:\nArgh! (So it's not connected...)\nEma:\nLet's have another good look at this area! Surely, there must be something that sticks out to you?\nEdgeworth:\n(Something that sticks out... Perhaps if I compare it to the evidence I hold.)\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis dust pattern... matches up perfectly with the base of the candelabra! It's likely that the killer got the candelabra from this very storeroom.\nEma:\nDoes that mean... the candelabra was also a piece of evidence?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's quite possible. However, that is not the issue here. The murder weapon originally came from this storeroom. We must keep that in mind.\nMasks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEma:\nDon't you think it's kinda creepy how all these masks are lined up in such a dark place?\nEdgeworth:\nHmm. Ema, are you not good with horror movies?\nEma:\nN-N-N-N-No way! Horror movies are so unscientific.\nEdgeworth:\n(...So she's scared of them.)\n\n\n\nBefore deducing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I won't rest until I've inspected every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)\n\n\n\n\nAfter deducing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I already checked this area earlier, but it never hurts to take another look.)\n\n\n\n\nOrange mask\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEma:\nTh-This mask is...! ...the Mysterious Global Hero... Onyankopon!\nEdgeworth:\nWhy are you so surprised?\nEma:\nMr. Edgeworth, don't you know? Everything about this show is shrouded in mystery! From he production company to the broadcast times... Even the merchandise is hard to find!\nEdgeworth:\n(Wouldn't that mean... the company simply went bankrupt?)\n\n\n\n\nFlower mask\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEma:\nIt's Captain Saipan! He's really popular in Europe. All the kids, and even the adults, dress up like him.\nEdgeworth:\n(...I think the flower on his head would be a little too much.)\n\n\n\n\nHelmet masks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEma:\nWhat TV show are these masks from?\nEdgeworth:\nI'm not very familiar with it, but... I believe it's called \"The Students of the Starry School.\" Each member of the class is a hero of justice.\nEma:\nSo I guess those red and white caps are a part of their school uniforms! And maybe the number of eye slits on the masks corresponds to their class rankings? See, the one on the left is ranked Number 1, and the one on the right is Number 2, and so on.\nEdgeworth:\nOh... I see. So that's how it works.\nEma:\nIf that's the case, the student with the lowest rank would have a mask full of holes...!\nEdgeworth:\n(...I guess we'll have to watch the show to find out.)\n\n\n\n\nPink Princess mask\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhen you think of the heroines from the Steel Samurai universe, she's the first to come to mind.\nEma:\nThat's right! I love the Pink Princess too!\nEdgeworth:\n...Ema, you watch this kind of show?\nEma:\nYeah, of course! You like it too, don't you, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n! No, I... wouldn't go that far.\nEma:\nReally? Since you had a Steel Samurai figure in your office, I thought for sure...\nEdgeworth:\n(Ngh... So even Ema has noticed it...!)\n\n\n\n\nEmpty hook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nVarious masks are placed here... There's even one of the Steel Samurai. (Indeed, these are... fairly high-quality replicas.)\nEma:\nScientifically speaking... it's just a bunch of random masks!\nEdgeworth:\nIt certainly does look like a hodgepodge collection of masks. Hmm, this hook is...\nEma:\nIt looks like a hook to hang a mask from.\nEdgeworth:\n(I wonder what mask used to be here?)\n\n\n\n\nSteel Samurai masks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe Steel Samurai, Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo, and the Nickel Samurai...\nEma:\nThe Nickel Samurai always seemed kinda smug by comparison. And his slender build doesn't look cool at all! I definitely prefer the Steel Samurai.\nEdgeworth:\n(...Hm. It seems she has good taste.)\n\n\n\n\nFiles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThese are...! Murder case files!\nEma:\nEhhh!? Wh-What are those doing here?\nEdgeworth:\nBy all rights, they should be kept at the Prosecutor's Building or the courthouse, but... ...it would seem that someone has removed them. (Something is afoot, and we are none the wiser...!)\n\n\n\n\nDeduce\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(Is this spot somehow connected to any of the evidence I hold...?)\n\n\n\nDeduce empty hook and present Jammin' Ninja Mask\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The Jammin' Ninja mask that Kay had with her...\"\n\n\n\n\nOtherwise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nEma, what do you think about this piece of evidence, and this area?\nEma:\nHmm... Scientifically speaking, I'd say they're not connected at all!\nEdgeworth:\nNwargh! (That was fast.)\nEma:\nMr. Edgeworth. Please look over this area again. Doesn't it feel like something is missing?\nEdgeworth:\n(Something is missing...? Do I have any idea as to what this missing item could be?)\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe Jammin' Ninja mask that Kay had with her... Perhaps it was originally attached to this hook!\nEma:\nThat sounds plausible. Scientifically speaking. In other words... Kay came here?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's quite likely. But... for what purpose?\nEma:\nMaybe she was going to steal something from this place.\nEdgeworth:\n(A Great Thief who steals the truth, huh...) No, I don't think we can answer that question at this time.\nWooden trunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEma:\nScientifically speaking, this must be a wooden ice box. This chain is tied around it to keep the cold from escaping. Probably.\nEdgeworth:\nNo, Ema... Wouldn't this be a costume trunk? It's made from wood that repels bugs in order to protect the clothes inside.\nEma:\nAh, I see. Of course! That's another possible theory. If your clothes are stored in a cold place, it would be nice and cool to wear in the summer.\nEdgeworth:\n(...I guess she's sticking to her ice box theory.)\nTrophies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEma:\nThere's a transceiver sitting next to all these trophies.\nEdgeworth:\n(It seems like they were lined up together on purpose...)\nEma:\nLooks like it's still got batteries in it. Might come in handy later, so I'll pick them up for now... I'll be sure to put it to good use before I turn it in to the police.\nEdgeworth:\n(That sounds just like what a certain Great Thief would say...)\nStatue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"This statue...!\"\nYellow desk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEma:\nWow... Talk about bad taste! I've never seen such a gaudy desk before! Just what kind of person would use something like this?\nEdgeworth:\n(The table top is being supported by four naked men. The design is quite painful to look at. It certainly is in poor taste.)\nEma:\nMaybe this is also related to one of your past cases?\nEdgeworth:\nNo. None of the cases I handled involved a person with such bad taste. (...Or at least I hope not.)\nKay Faraday\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nYes? Can I help with something?\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStuffed Animal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nThat's a cute stuffed animal. ...Is it a bull?\nEdgeworth:\nYes. It appears so. I found this at a crime scene with you just the other day...\nKay:\nOne of its horns is broken... So I guess even a stuffed animal can get injured... Ah...! My head, it hurts...!\nEdgeworth:\n! What's wrong?\nKay:\nFor some reason, looking at that stuffed animal makes my head...!\nEdgeworth:\n(Hmm... I'd better put this away for now.)\nLift\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEma:\nLook, look. Check it out. This lift has a sturdy platform and solid steel supports! According to my calculations, it should be able to support the weight of 50 Mr. Edgeworths.\nEdgeworth:\nI doubt there is enough space for that many people. It seems to be used for moving goods.\nEma:\nI wonder about that. If you pack them in real tight, they just might fit. All 50 of them.\nEdgeworth:\nImpossible. That aside, there are still some more places in this storeroom we need to examine. We'll examine the lift after we finish our investigation here.\nEma:\nImpossible, huh... Then how about 45! No, we might even be able to fit 48 people...\nRaymond Shields\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay:\nOh man. Uncle Ray's heart is pounding up a storm! Surrounded by so many cutie-pies in such a small, cramped room!\nEdgeworth:\n...Mr. Shields. Please try to be more serious.\nRay:\nHeh heh heh. It was just a joke. Uncle Ray's keeping a close watch over little Kay. So you can continue your investigation without worry.\nEdgeworth:\n(You watching over Kay is exactly what I'm worried about...)\nMoney\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere's a huge stack of money piled up here. ...How unrefined.\nEma:\nThey're all 100 dollar bills! Talk about big bucks (Big bucks - Stacks of cash found in storeroom. A big deal went down here.)! So, how many times your yearly salary do you think this is worth?\nEdgeworth:\nLeave my salary out of this!\nGiant head\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEma:\nWhat's this? It looks like... a giant head!\nEdgeworth:\nIf I recall, this is the head of \"Mrs. Monkey.\" (I believe it was from a case I was involved with in the past. It's impressive how they were able to get such a large object into this room.)\nEma:\nHrmm. \"Mrs. Monkey\", huh? That doesn't really have a nice ring to it. Maybe you remembered the name wrong, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nNgh... I-Impossible. (That can't be true!)\nEdgeworth:\nThis statue...!\nEma:\nYes, is it some sort of new fact?\nEdgeworth:\nNo... this is evidence from a case that I was previously involved in. (I believe it was called the \"Alice Red\" statue. There were supposed to be two of them, one real and one fake, but... ...no matter which one this is, it's unnatural for it to turn up in a place like this.)\nEma:\nMr. Edgeworth, you've really seen a lot of cases..... huh?\n???:\nGotchaaaaaa! Yippee-ki-yay! I got me a scoooooop!\nEma:\nEeeeek!\nEdgeworth:\nGah... my eyes...! Stop it!\nLotta:\nYa ain't gettin' away from the Great Lotta's camera that easily! I reckon y'all must be criminals! I'ma snap 16 shots before y'all can even say \"Cheese!\"\nEma:\nWe're not criminals!\nLotta:\n...Really? Ya ain't foolin' my camera of justice with those words!\nEdgeworth:\nHm, you are...\nLotta:\nHuuh? Yer... Ain't ya that heinous prosecutor from back then!?\nEdgeworth:\nWho are you calling heinous!? (This is Lotta Hart... She's a photographer I've dealt with during my past cases. I see her distinctive accent and her chatterbox mouth haven't changed a bit.)\nLotta:\nJust look at that face! Yer obviously up to no good!\nEdgeworth:\n(It seems she has a bad impression of us.)\nLotta:\nNow it's time to pay yer dues! Stand still while I photograph y'all!\nEma:\nWe only came here to investigate...\nLotta:\nLies! Ya think ya can fool me like that?\nEma:\n...Mr. Edgeworth. She's not listening at all.\nEdgeworth:\n...She seems harmless. Let's just leave her be, for now.\nPartner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEma:\nAsk me anything you want!\n\n\n\nLotta Hart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEma:\nSomehow, I get the feeling she doesn't like you very much, Mr. Edgeworth. She's even calling you absurd things like a heinous prosecutor.\nEdgeworth:\nShe's been involved with a few of my previous cases. Her turning up here was a bit unexpected, but let us continue with our own investigation. If we gather clues, and connect them with \"Logic\"... ...then the truth will come to me. That is my way of doing things. I won't let a \"heinous journalist\" get in my way!\nEma:\n.....Umm, Mr. Edgeworth? Are you bothered by being called a heinous prosecutor?\nEdgeworth:\nNgh... M-Most definitely not!\n\n\n\n\nThe Information (after connecting money logic, before speaking to Lotta Hart again)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEma:\nI wonder what Ms. Hart came here to do? Armed with such a nice camera, it looks like she was after something.\nEdgeworth:\nWe know that the trading of evidence had taken place here. There is a chance that what she was after may be related to that.\nEma:\nI really don't want to, but let's  hear what she has to say!\nEdgeworth:\nVerily. I agree. (Especially about the \"not wanting to\" part...)\nLotta Hart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLotta:\nSo... what're all y'all folks doin' in a suspicious place like this?\nEdgeworth:\nI-I was about to ask you the very same question. Why are you here?\nLotta:\nFor the people of the world, and for myself! I'm a social justice photographer after all! So I gotta take photo after photo after photo for my big scooop!\nEdgeworth:\n(It seems I won't be able to talk to her normally when she's like this...)\nLotta Hart (after connecting money logic)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo, why did you come here?\nLotta:\nFor the people of the world, and for myself! I'm a social justice photographer after all!\nEma:\nS-Social Justice...\nEdgeworth:\nThen allow me to guess the reason why you came here. Was it perhaps to expose the illegal trafficking?\nEma:\nOh, I get it. You were trying to get a scoop on the secret dealings!\nLotta:\n...H-Huh. Y'all know that much already? Well, I reckon there ain't no reason to hide it anymore... My sources tell me there's some kind of black market auction bein' held round these parts.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat did you say!? So then, all this evidence here is...\nLotta:\nYup, they're the goods for the auction. There's a lotta dirty money flyin' round here. I wanted to try and catch it with my own two eyes. My source gave me a whole buncha info, but... ...I figured just hearing about it ain't enough. Seein' is believein', after all. So I've been stakin' out the place from behind this here statue since yesterday. The auction took place late last night, and went on 'til the early mornin'.\nEdgeworth:\n(A murder on the night of the black market auction. Could the two events be related...?)\n\n\n\n\nLotta Hart (after connecting money logic)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLotta:\nY'all got somethin' to say?\n\n\n\n\nThe auction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLotta:\nBlack market dealings in the Grand Tower!! Guess I really hit the mother lode this time!\nEdgeworth:\nWere all the items in the auction pieces of evidence?\nLotta:\nThere was some normal stuff too, like stolen art and the like.\nEdgeworth:\n(I wouldn't consider stolen art to be normal.)\nLotta:\nBut, I reckon the evidence was the star of the show here! These folks are law fanatics, tryin' to get their hands on the latest goods from the police.\nEma:\nSo that's what you wanted to get pictures of, Ms. Hart? Pretty much! They were meetin' right under this very storeroom. So I watched 'em from up here.\nEdgeworth:\nYou said you were here since yesterday. Did you witness the entire event?\nLotta:\nIt was a black market auction, after all. They followed a fairly detailed procedure. First, the participants entered the storeroom from the viewin' platform one at a time. When they got in, they each took one of those masks on the wall over there... Funny thing 'bout those masks... They're all equipped with voice changers. Itty bitty ones. That way they wouldn't be recognized. They wanted to protect their... \"an anemone\"?\nEma:\nYou mean... their \"anonymity\"?\nLotta:\nYeah, that's it! Their \"anomnintany\"!\nEdgeworth:\n(Why not just say \"identity\" and make things easier for all of us...?)\nLotta:\nAfter puttin' on the mask, they'd go down the lift, and the next feller would come right in. On the way back, it was the exact same thing, but in reverse. They'd come up one by one, return the mask, and head up outta the storeroom.\nEma:\nWow, that's pretty thorough.\nMasks data jotted down in my Organizer.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm. How many participants were there?\nLotta:\n11 people altogether. I counted each of 'em as they made their way down (Auction participants - Entered the storeroom from roof one at a time. Exited the same way.).\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened? (appears after The auction)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLotta:\nI'll have you know, I wasn't just laid up behind this statue the entire time.\nEdgeworth:\nThen, where were you in the beginning?\nLotta:\nThe beginnin'...? Well, don't you worry yerself about that, ya hear?\nEdgeworth:\n(So she was hiding behind the statue the entire time.)\nLotta:\nI watched the folks comin' in while lurkin' in the shadows... All secret agent-like...\nEma:\nNote to self: secret agents like to lurk in the shadows.\nLotta:\nAnd then, they used that lift over there to get down to the auction site. After they all went down, I watched the whole thing from the lift.\nEdgeworth:\nDid that lift stay down the entire time?\nLotta:\nNaw, it came back up. But there's a tiny gap in the floor there. There's a bit of space between the floor and the lift platform, ya see. So I could see just about everything that was goin' on down there.\nEdgeworth:\nThen, did you see the person who was conducting the auction!?\nLotta:\nEh!? W-Well... yeah! You betcha, I did! What kinda story would this be if I didn't know who the \"Conductor\" was?\nEdgeworth:\n(The Conductor, huh? It seems I'll need to ask her for more details.)\n\n\n\n\nThe Conductor (appears after What happened?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nDo you have any more information about this so-called Conductor?\nLotta:\n........Ya know. I came here to get me a scoop. What makes ya think I'll give up my info to you all willy nilly!?\nEdgeworth:\nBasically... what you're saying is, you don't know.\nEma:\nAh, I see. So that's why she won't answer!\nLotta:\n.....What can I say? I couldn't even tell how old they were, or if they were a guy or a gal.\nEdgeworth:\nCan you tell me what the person was wearing at the time?\nLotta:\nThey had on a white jacket with a purple flower, and they were wearin' white gloves. But ya know, that don't mean much when I have no earthly clue who they really are.\nEma:\nSo the Conductor's identity was hidden, just like the participants?\nLotta:\nThat's right! They had on a mask and voice changer, just like everyone else!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat kind of mask... did this person wear?\nLotta:\nIt was... a \"Zurvan\" mask, I reckon!\nEdgeworth:\nZu... Zurvan...! What in blazes is that supposed to be...?\nEma:\nMr. Edgeworth! You don't know about Zurvan? He's the sworn enemy of Global Hero Onyankopon! \"Zurvan, the Ruler of Time!\" Seriously! Who hasn't heard of him!?\nEdgeworth:\n(Most people, I'd imagine...) Since the Conductor wore a mask, I assume you were not able to see their face...?\nLotta:\nNot even a teeny weeny bit! And after I came all this way for my big scoop... *sniff*... This whole story's turnin' out to be nuthin' but fool's gold.\nConductor's Clothes jotted down in my Organizer.\nEdgeworth:\n(That set of clothes seems familiar. Perhaps I should show her that piece of evidence.)\n\n\n\n\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYatagarasu's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLotta:\nTh-That badge is...!\nEdgeworth:\nIt's the genunine badge of the Yatagarasu. Perhaps we could trade some information...\nLotta:\nNot a chance. The Yatagarasu ain't nothing but yesterday's biscuits. I need somethin' with more impact! That there badge won't stir up nothin' interestin'.\nEdgeworth:\nStir things up...? Don't tell me you intend to spread false information?\nLotta:\nDon't be draggin' my name through the mud. I just wanna spice things up a bit. ...Maybe dress it up a little and add some juicy bits here and there.\nEdgeworth:\nYou shouldn't compromise your stories with fabrications, Ms. Hart!\n\n\n\n\nAutopsy Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"You said the Conductor wore a white jacket with a purple flower, and white gloves?\"\n\n\n\n\nMasks or Conductor's Clothes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLotta:\nHmm. If I'm gonna make the news, I'll need to find out the Conductor's true identity.\nEdgeworth:\nThat person wore a mask and a voice changer, right?\nLotta:\nAlong with a white suit and a purple flower. Aww, shucks! Was all this a waste of time?\nEdgeworth:\nI wouldn't say you wasted your time, Ms. Hart.\nLotta:\nCollectin' info ain't easy! You gotta pay for film, and travel expenses... And after stakin' out the place for a whole day, I'm starvin'!\nEdgeworth:\nIf you are truly after a scoop, you should be willing to endure that much!\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLotta:\nLemme just say, if yer tryin' to grab my interest... ...ya gotta bring me something that actually smells like a scoop!\nEdgeworth:\n(...I guess this didn't catch her interest.)\nStatue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEma:\nEarlier, you said that this was evidence from a case that you were involved with. At any rate, you've gotta admit that this is a very strange statue.\nEdgeworth:\nIt's the Alice Red statue.\nEma:\n.....Huh?\nEdgeworth:\nThis is the Alice Red statue.\nEma:\nBut it doesn't look all red to me... Wait, the name is written here: \"Alif Red\" statue. Alif Red... All is Red. All is Red... Alif Red.\nEdgeworth:\nHm? What are you mumbling to yourself about over there?\nEma:\nN-No! It's nothing. Come on, let's examine some other places!\nEdgeworth:\n(.....?)\nEdgeworth:\nYou said the Conductor wore a white jacket with a purple flower, and white gloves?\nLotta:\nThat's right. They sure looked spiffy for a criminal mastermind.\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Hart, did they look anything like this?\nLotta:\nHeeeey! That's it! That's the Conductor! ...H-H-Hold yer horses! Are ya tellin' me the Conductor is dead!?\nEdgeworth:\nShe is the victim of a case we are investigating.\nEma:\nHer name is Jill Crane. Have you heard of her?\nLotta:\nCan't say I have... So, she was a lady, huh. What kinda gal dresses like that? She get her kicks by foolin' me into thinkin' she's a guy!?\nEdgeworth:\n(I doubt that her intention was to deceive you... Setting that aside... We have established something of major importance. The victim was the Conductor of the black market auction.)\nLotta:\nI see... so the Conductor was killed. Then that might explain...\nEdgeworth:\nExplain what, Ms. Hart?\nLotta:\nAh! N-No, no, no! It's nothin', honest!\nEma:\nMs. Hart... You clearly sounded suspicious just now.\nLotta:\nAnd I'm tellin' ya, I ain't! Hmm, can't be...\nEdgeworth:\n...Sorry, were you trying to say something?\nLotta:\nNo, I ain't! I ain't said nothin'!\nEma:\nPlease don't be like that. Just tell us.\nLotta:\nHow many times do I gotta tell y'all? I'm a journalist! Information is what pays the bills. I can't just go around spoutin' everything I know! I've already said too much! I got nothin' left to say to y'all!\nEma:\nTh-Then! What if I found some fingerprints for you?\nLotta:\nWh-What good would that do me!? I don't want none of yer dusty old prints! Why don't you two follow my example, and do some investigatin' on yer own!\nEma:\nOoh... I guess she won't tell us anything.\nEdgeworth:\nNot to worry, Ema. Just leave it to me. I have a certain method of drawing out information from those who wish to hide it. If my opponent's lips are sealed, I will be the one to unseal them. Let us begin.\nEdgeworth:\nFirst, let's analyze my opponent's demeanor...\n3 CHESS PIECES\nLotta:\nI ain't tellin' you nothin'! So quit wastin' my time.\nEdgeworth:\n(She seems rather impatient. As if she's trying to cut off the conversation.) I must be careful with my time... I won't have long to consider my responses. I'm almost certain... that she's hiding something from me. That's where I'll begin my attack. Now, time for the first move!\nBegin Logic Chess\nGive me the information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI want you to tell me everything that you know, right now!\nLotta:\nNooooo way, Jose! I ain't spillin' my guts to someone I have no connection with!\n\n\n\nBefore obtaining clue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n........  I don't have enough clues to proceed with this line of questioning... Maybe I should try another line of attack.\nLeads back to first\n\n\n\n\nAfter obtaining clue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Perhaps I should use that clue...\"\nLet's calm down and talk this over...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nDon't you think you're overreacting a bit? Let's just calm down and...\nLotta:\nI'm always calm! Now leave me alone!\n\n\n\nYou don't look calm to me!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHaven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!\nLotta:\nWhat're ya yappin' about? All yer doin' is wastin' my time!\nEdgeworth:\n(Argh... That was a wasted remark.) Ms. Hart is getting increasingly impatient.

I have something interesting to tell you. A few days ago, I met another self-proclaimed journalist. She spoke with an accent quite similar to your own...\nLotta:\nS-She spoke like me? Then, maybe it was...\n\n\n\nYes. It was your student.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"...Nicole Swift.\"\n\n\n\n\nYes. It was your sister.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHaven't you realized it yet?

I won't have long to consider my responses.\nLeads back to first\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Nicole Swift. She had a distinct way of speaking. One very much like your own. Furthermore, she said that she had a mentor... Could she have been referring to you?\nLotta:\nO-Oh! So you know Nicole? Weeell, ain't that a fun little coincidence! Where'd y'all meet? Wait... No, no! Stop tryin' to get me to spill the beans! Phew, that was a close call.\nEdgeworth:\n(It seems that she lets down her guard when she talks about Ms. Swift. This could be a useful clue.)\nLeads back to first\nLet's calm down and talk this over... (after obtaining clue)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI've run this line of questioning to its conclusion...

I guess I could let you in on my scoo... N-No! I ain't fallin' for your nasty tricks! No siree!\nEdgeworth:\nYour \"scoo\"?\nLotta:\nN-No, just forget it.

I'm gonna sell the story to a publisher!\nEdgeworth:\nThe information she is hiding could be vital to the investigation. I need to make her talk. Next, I will press her on the contents of her scoop. She may be quick to lose her temper, but she's even quicker to loosen her tongue. She is not a different opponent. Now, to extract the information I need.\nIt is related to the black market auction...?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nDoes this scoop of yours have something to do with the black market auction?\nLotta:\nWhat're ya talkin' about...?

The only logical conclusion is... that your story has something to do with it!\nLotta:\nY-You ain't gettin' any answers from me.

A little while after the auction started... ...someone won a bid, and the Conductor banged the gavel.

Isn't that... pretty obvious?\nEdgeworth:\nDo you remember how the participants left the auction?\nEma:\nOf course. They'd pass through this storeroom on the way back from the auction... Ah!\nEdgeworth:\nExactly. The culprit had to hide the body, so that the participants wouldn't discover it. (The real question is... where was the body hidden? (Where was the body hidden? - Culprit hid the body so it would not be seen by the auction participants.)) Ema, would you mind lending me a hand?\nEma:\nLeave it to me!

If you do that, you'll be able to spray the luminol reagent at it! If there's a bloodstain on the spot where you sprayed, you'll get a reaction like this. Even so... Ugh. No matter how many times I see bloodstains, they're always so gruesome... There's a blood reaction here, but it's kind of faint. Let's spray it with luminol two or three more times, so it'll be nice and clear! You can see it clearly now. Ugh... It looks even more gruesome than before. Do you understand how to look for bloodstains now? There are probably a few more bloodstains here, so why don't you give it a try, Mr. Edgeworth?\nSpray luminol on top of ladder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Let's search the rest of the storeroom for bloodstains just like that!\"\nEma:\nLet's search the rest of the storeroom for bloodstains just like that!

It couldn't have been in that dressin' box!\nEdgeworth:\n...What do you mean?\nLotta:\nWhen I first came down here, that box caught my eye too. It was just the right side and woulda made the perfect hidin' place! That's what I thought, anyway... But I couldn't get the dang thing to open. It'd been wrapped up real tight with a locked chain. The murder happened after that, so hidin' a body in there woulda been impossible, ya know?\nEdgeworth:\nA chain wrapped around it? That's a bit strange... Right now, it doesn't seem to be locked up at all...\nLotta:\n...Huh? That's weird.

I was aiming for that weak ex-prosecutor.\nDebeste:\nYou were clearly aiming at me!\nFranziska:\nMaybe something got in my way. Particularly...\nDebeste:\nHNGYEEEAARGH!\nFranziska:\n...right around here.\nEdgeworth:\nFranziska...\nFranziska:\nJust what do you think you're doing here, Ex-prosecutor Miles Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n...I do not believe that Kay is the culprit behind this incident.\nFranziska:\nYou're just an ordinary man without investigation rights. What you say does not matter... I am Franziska von Karma. I will never stop moving forward. However, you chose to quit. The outcome of our battle has already been decided.\nEdgeworth:\nI cast away my badge... because it became a millstone around my neck. I shall continue moving forward, even without it. The path I walk will surely lead to the truth... My actions are driven by that belief. And that is something which will never change.\nFranziska:\nSo, you're saying that you've found a path to the truth? Then show it to me! But if that path... proves to be a foolish one, it will not survive my whip!\n-- Franziska's Logic --\nFranziska:\nThe victim used her keycard and entered this room with the culprit.\nThen, the culprit stabbed the victim in the chest with the candelabra, killing her.\nShouldn't the letter make it obvious who the culprit is?\nOf course, the crime scene was right here in this room: the P.I.C. meeting room.\nThe proof is the bloodstain we found here in the meeting room! That settles it, Miles Edgeworth.\nEma:\nMs. von Karma seems really confident, doesn't she?\nRay:\nAh, I see! She's a fiery one, isn't she? I don't mind a feisty cutie. So how about an introductory hu-UUUUUG!\nFranziska:\n...How repulsive. Well, Miles Edgeworth. Can you break my logic? If you truly have no intention of stopping here, prove it to me with evidence!\nEdgeworth:\n...Very well. I'll show you, Franziska. The evidence that paves my path!\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Was there nothing suspicious about the security system? Franziska: The meeting room's security is perfect, much like my logic. ...There is no room for doubt. Edgeworth: (Your logic isn't as perfect as you think...) ...In any case, your opinion has not changed? Franziska: Yes. The victim and the culprit entered the room together.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Did the victim's wounds match up with the candelabra? Franziska: The victim's chest was pierced in three places simultaneously by a sharp metal object. Is there anything else that could have done such a thing? That should all be written in Dr. Young's autopsy report. Edgeworth: ...So you're sure that the murder weapon was the candelabra? Franziska: Exactly. As for who the culprit is...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Do you have anything to confirm that the letter was actually sent by Kay? Franziska: Are you proposing that it was forged by the real criminal? That possibility was dismissed some time ago. There were no traces of forgery on the letter. Of course, there were no other traces besides Kay Faraday and the victim found on the letter. Edgeworth: ...Are you saying you found Kay's fingerprints on the letter? Franziska: The only fingerprints we found belonged to the victim. Ray: In other words... you can't really say that Kay is the culprit. Franziska: Didn't I just say that the possibility of a forgery has been dismissed? That letter was originally sent by Kay Faraday. Therefore, it is only natural to assume that she is the culprit.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Do you have any proof that the crime took place in this room? Franziska: \"A Von Karma is perfect in every way.\" Perhaps you forgot that when you gave up your badge?\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Have we determined who the blood actually belongs to? Franziska: The blood analysis confirmed that it belonged to the victim. Edgeworth: Just because the bloodstain was found here, doesn't mean that this was the scene of the crime. Franziska: You forget, Miles Edgeworth, that in court, evidence is everything. If you believe this room is not the crime scene, show me the evidence that proves it! Edgeworth: (Evidence that shows where the crime took place? We may not be in court, but... I'll show her the truth!)\nEma: Ms. von Karma isn't showing any openings!\nEdgeworth: However, there is one fact we know that she does not.\nEma: They're not the only ones who can perform scientific investigations!\nEdgeworth: (And therein lies the proof... the path to the truth I've found!)",

The victim and the culprit entered the room together.\nFranziska:\nThen, the culprit stabbed the victim in the chest with the candelabra, killing her.\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nDid the victim's wounds match up with the candelabra?\nFranziska:\nThe victim's chest was pierced in three places simultaneously by a sharp metal object. Is there anything else that could have done such a thing? That should all be written in Dr. Young's autopsy report.\nEdgeworth:\n...So you're sure that the murder weapon was the candelabra?\nFranziska:\nExactly.

This culprit knows no fear.\nEdgeworth:\nI wonder about that. Have a look at this piece of evidence. Blood was found in the storeroom right above the meeting room. As you can see, there are signs that it has dripped down onto the floor below. And right under the hidden lift is...\nFranziska:\nThe statue of Lady Justice...!\nEdgeworth:\nThen you understand. The murder did not take place here. The killer murdered the victim in the storeroom, and then moved the body to this room. What Lady Justice witnessed was a coward trying to conceal their crime! And not the moment of the murder!\nFranziska:\n.........\nEdgeworth:\n(...She's smiling?)\nFranziska:\n...Pardon me. I just remembered a conversation quite similar to this one. As I expected, Miles Edgeworth. ...Such naïveté couldn't possibly be an act.\nGumshoe:\nJust how is Mr. Edgeworth naïve!? YEOOOOOOWCH!\nFranziska:\nHave you forgotten? Or are you just playing the foolish fool? The amount of blood in the meeting room is clearly greater than in the storeroom.\nGumshoe:\nUugh... Please don't just hit me and then ignore me... YEAAAARGH!\nFranziska:\nSuch a large amount of blood couldn't have simply dripped from the floor above. And even if it had, there should have been much more blood left behind in the storeroom! The murder could not have occurred anywhere other than this meeting room!\nEdgeworth:\n...Hmph. You're as predictable as always, Franziska.\nFranziska:\nWh-What...!\nEdgeworth:\nThe difference in the amount of blood is just as you say. The question is, why does such a difference exist?\nFranziska:\nThat issue is trivial. I've already explained it with my perfect logic.\nEdgeworth:\nIn that case, how do you explain the blood that was found in the storeroom? I don't suppose you're going to tell me that it somehow sprayed all the way up there?\nDebeste:\nLike a water fountain? No waaay!\nEdgeworth:\nExactly. It's impossible. In other words... ...the reason for the difference in the amount of blood is... (The amount of blood in the meeting room and the storeroom are different because...)\nThe weapon was pulled out here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The victim died of a stab wound. Naturally, there would be a significant amount of blood loss.\"\nShe was stabbed here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe victim was stabbed with the murder weapon in the meeting room!\nFranziska:\nMiles Edgeworth, who was it that said the storeroom was the scene of the crime? Take responsibility for your own claims!\nEdgeworth:\nGwaaah! (It seems I was mistaken! The blood in the storeroom must have been left when the victim was stabbed. There must have been another moment when the victim was bleeding more heavily. That would explain why such a large amount of blood was left in the meeting room!)\nFranziska:\nIt seems you can't explain the difference in the amount of blood that was left behind.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. Do not take me lightly. I already know the answer to that.\nLeads back to:\n\"(The amount of blood in the meeting room and the storeroom are different because...)\"\nShe was stabbed in the storeroom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe victim was stabbed in the storeroom with the murder weapon!\nFranziska:\nBeing stabbed in the storeroom doesn't explain the difference in the amount of blood... That explanation is unacceptable!\nEdgeworth:\nMmmph! (So it wasn't that! The blood in the storeroom must have been left when the victim was stabbed. There must have been another moment when the victim was bleeding more heavily. That would explain why such a large amount of blood was left in the meeting room!)\nFranziska:\nIt seems you can't explain the difference in the amount of blood that was left behind.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. Do not take me lightly. I already know the answer to that.\nLeads back to:\n\"(The amount of blood in the meeting room and the storeroom are different because...)\"\nEdgeworth:\nThe victim died of a stab wound. Naturally, there would be a significant amount of blood loss.\nFranziska:\n...That's obvious just from looking at the bloodstain.\nDebeste:\nBut that's so weird! She was attacked in the storeroom, but there was less blood found there than... GYAAAUUGH!\nFranziska:\nSilence! You third-rate prosecutor!\nDebeste:\nBut I'm the Best... GYAAAUUGH!\nEdgeworth:\nDo you know when you lose the most blood after getting stabbed with a sharp object?\nEma:\nAh! I know! It's when the sharp object is pulled out, right!\nEdgeworth:\nPrecisely. After being stabbed with the candelabra, the body was moved to the meeting room. And then, the murder weapon was pulled out right here in this very room... That would account for the difference in the amount of blood that was left behind!\nEma:\nBut why would the culprit go through all that trouble?\nEdgeworth:\nMost likely to give the impression that the murder occurred in the meeting room. It seems Ms. Crane's keycard was used last night... ...but based on the time of use, it must have been a ploy by the culprit to mislead us. In all likelihood, it was the culprit who used the keycard to enter the meeting room.\nFranziska:\nWhy would culprit have needed to do that?\nEdgeworth:\nPerhaps they feared that the storeroom would be found out during the investigation? If they were involved in the auction, they would not have wanted it to become public.\nMeeting Room Blood data jotted down in my Organizer.\nFranziska:\nThe auction... you say?\nEdgeworth:\nPerhaps you should go upstairs and see for yourself what items are on display. I'm sure that will allow you to understand what occurred here.\nFranziska:\n........ ...Impressive, Miles Edgeworth. You're willing to go that far to protect her?\nEdgeworth:\nThere's something big lurking behind the scenes of this case. Kay simply got caught up in it.\nFranziska:\nYou're exaggerating.\nEdgeworth:\nAm I now? More than anyone, I would think you'd understand the significance behind all this. Why would you, a prosecutor working with Interpol, be involved in a domestic case? Wasn't your objective to crush a certain international smuggling ring? If your search for smuggled goods has led you here... ...then, isn't this feeling I have related to the case?\nFranziska:\n...I'm relieved. You haven't lost your touch, even though you've turned in your badge. I've heard about your situation... from Scruffy over there.\nGumshoe:\nAh, umm... sorry, sir. I just wanted to help out somehow...\nEdgeworth:\nA wise decision, Detective.\nGumshoe:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nFranziska, are you the one in charge of this case? Isn't Interpol pursing the black market auction?\nFranziska:\nAnd what if I am? That's not something you need to know.\nEdgeworth:\nSo, you knew about all this from the very beginning? You knew the black market auction was being held... right here.\nLotta:\nHey, hey, mind if I butt in? About that gal who turned up dead...\nFranziska:\nYou!\nLotta:\nHey! I ain't done talkin' yet! AIIIEEEE! Ya ain't changed a lick!\nFranziska:\nThis case doesn't need even a fragment of your faulty testimony!\nLotta:\nWhat're ya sayin'!? I'm a bona fide journa-OWWW!\nFranziska:\nBack then...! You gave false testimony...!\nEma:\n...Ms. von Karma seems to really dislike Lotta.\nEdgeworth:\n...I can't say she's fond of her.\nLotta:\nAin't that Crane gal one of them P.I.C. members? She's the spittin' image of the Conductor! I reckon she's... YEEOOOWCH! She hit me! She hit me again!\nFranziska:\nWhat is the meaning of this!? Answer me, Miles Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nFrom Ms. Hart's testimony, we obtained a description of what the Conductor was wearing. And it matches what the victim, Jill Crane, was wearing.\nFranziska:\nYou mean to say... the one who was murdered was the Conductor! ........!\nGumshoe:\nM-Ms. von Karma, maybe you should calm... AIIEEEEE!\nFranziska:\nIt would seem that a new fact has just been brought to light. ...Indeed, I came here in pursuit of the black market auction. In order to arrest the organizer of the event... in other words, the Conductor!\nEdgeworth:\nIf we believe Ms. Hart's testimony, then the Conductor is already dead. Wouldn't this mean that your investigation has ended in vain?\nFranziska:\nThat's right. However... ...I swear on my name that I will not return empty-handed! I challenge you, Miles Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\n(A challenge is fine, but... ...why is she readying her whip like she's out for a victim of her own?)\n-- Franziska's Logic, Pt. 2 --\nFranziska:\nI will concede your argument. The murder occurred in the storeroom, correct?\nThat would mean the culprit is someone who participated in the auction.\nIf that photographer is correct, the victim was the Conductor, and the culprit was a customer.\nThe culprit waited for the victim in the storeroom, where the goods were delivered.\nThen, they stabbed the victim in the chest with the candelabra in the storeroom.\nFranziska:\n...That is all. I trust you have no objections.\nEdgeworth:\nUnfortunately, that is not the case, because there is a hole in your testimony.\nEma:\nAs expected of Mr. Edgeworth! I didn't noticed anything at all! Well then, please settle this with one blow!\nEdgeworth:\nYes, of course. Watch as I crush her logic!\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: You were surprisingly quick to concede. Franziska: I simply cannot deny facts that are backed by evidence. ...That is all. You have proven that the murder occurred in the storeroom.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: The culprit participated in the auction... I'd like to hear your basis for this claim. Franziska: When I spoke with the staff of this building, not a single one mentioned the storeroom. The storeroom's existence must have only been known to a select few. Edgeworth: And that's where the items for the auction were being stored... Franziska: I see you understand. Yes, the culprit participated in the auction.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: So, you're saying that the victim was the auction's Conductor? Franziska: Right, and the culprit... Lotta: Hey, ain't ya the one who told her that just a moment ago!? Edgeworth: Yes. That's right; however, I was simply making sure her logic is clear... Lotta: That ain't right... Yer doin' it wrong. This is the part where yer supposed to say \"I dun goofed.\" Franziska: The culprit was a customer participating in the black market auction. Lotta: What in tarnation!? Now you've done it! Don't cover for him! Franziska: Of course... that is only if this photographer's testimony is need true. Edgeworth: (I can't tell whether they're on good or bad terms...) Franziska: The issue here is the culprit's actions.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Ms. Hart was in the storeroom at the time. Could the culprit really have been waiting there? Franziska: Franziska: I don't know where she was hiding, but... ...since you've seen it, you must know as well. There are numerous hiding places in that storeroom. Edgeworth: So the culprit was hiding while they waited for the victim to arrive... Franziska: I believe the crime occurred after the auction ended. After all, the victim was the organizer of the auction, the Conductor. During the auction, the organizer would have to be in front of the customers the entire time. Edgeworth: (After the auction ended...?) Please add that statement to your testimony. Adds statement: \"I believe the crime occurred after the auction ended.\"\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: The victim was killed after the auction ended... Are you certain of that? Franziska: The victim was the Conductor. That is the only possibility. Ema: Without the Conductor, the auction couldn't have been held. Edgeworth: The auction couldn't have been held...? (Something seems odd in this testimony...)\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: The candelabra in the storeroom? How do you know that? Franziska: If the murder weapon had been prepared in advance... ...the victim's chest would have been stabbed with something completely different. Based on the culprit's auctions, it's clear where the murder weapon came from. Ema: There were signs suggesting that the candelabra was once placed in the storeroom, too. Franziska: The items in the storeroom were intended to be sold as goods in the auction. Although, where the murder weapon was procured from is not the main issue here.\nEdgeworth: (At first glance, her logic seems to hold up, but something just doesn't feel quite right... I'll need to draw out more information.)",

No need to be so stiff. Actually... feel free to call me Blaisie.\nDebeste:\nWell, then... Blaisie, what brings you here?\nBlaise:\nHuh? Well, well. I just wanted to see if my idiot son was working hard, is all.\nEdgeworth:\n(Is this kind of father-son relationship really healthy...?)\nBlaise:\nI had come to light a fire under you, but it seems I've found an unexpected bonus. To think that the criminal who has become the talk of the town would be here, of all places.\nCourtney:\nEveryone! Restrain the suspect at once.\nEdgeworth:\nPlease wait! Kay Faraday is not the cul-\nBlaise:\nSilence!\nEdgeworth:\n...!\nBlaise:\nThis is quite troubling, Edgeworth. Didn't I tell you earlier? The P.I.C. desires a swift resolution to this case. If it's not, we could lose our trust with the public. They'd call us the Waste of Time Committee. Y'know, it's troubling for me as well, that sort of thing... And at my age too... *sniff* *sniff*\nCourtney:\nAnd on top of that... an illegal investigation is not something that I can overlook. Have you forgotten? You are no longer a prosecutor. You have lost all your authority. Furthermore... you have aided a criminal in evading the law.\nBlaise:\nYes, yes. That's right. You're so reliable, Courtney.\nEdgeworth:\nI am aware of the consequences of my actions. You may punish me as you wish. However... ...we have found a new suspect. It's the person pictured here. Kay Faraday was attacked by this person and...\nCourtney:\nCourtney:\nThere is no need for your explanation. Just recently, a red raincoat was discovered in the vicinity of this building. The victim's blood and cherry blossom petals were found on the hood.\nEdgeworth:\nCherry blossom petals? (Now that you mention it, on the viewing platform...)\nCourtney:\nYes. They probably stuck on due to the blood. They were littered around the bloodstain.\nBlaise:\nAnd we've received the forensic report on the blood, y'know. There's no doubt about it. The person in that photo is the victim, Jill Crane.\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What did you saaaaaaay!?\nRed Raincoat data jotted down in my Organizer.\nEdgeworth:\nI-Impossible! That would completely destroy the foundations of our logic. We had believed the person in the red raincoat was the culprit. And now it turns out... that person is actually the murder victim. W-Wait. If that's the case, then the prime suspect would be...!\nCourtney:\nMs. Faraday. You met a person in a red raincoat on the rooftop, did you not?\nKay:\nYes. I did, but...\nCourtney:\nThe person in the red raincoat was the murder victim. And Kay Faraday came into contact with that person. Since one of the parties is now dead, what happened next should be clear...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nKay was attacked by that person! As the victim, it would be impossible for her to be the culprit!\nCourtney:\nCourtney:\nThere is no evidence she was attacked, is there? Furthermore, we must consider the possibility that the victim fought back.\nEdgeworth:\nIt's far too early to come to that conclusion! Kay is not the criminal!\nKay:\n......You're wrong.\nGumshoe:\nK-Kay?\nKay:\nThat's... wrong. Even though I don't want to believe it myself... After hearing about the raincoat, I finally remembered. I only remember a little, but... from what I saw that night... ...the culprit... ...is me. I remember looking down... at the person in the red raincoat... Mr. Edgeworth! It was me! The culprit was me all along!\nEdgeworth:\nThat can't be right!\nKay:\nThen, why? Why do I have that memory? That person collapsed before my eyes... engulfed in a pool of blood... Why didn't I do anything? It must have been... because I killed her...\nCourtney:\nIt is clear to me, the validity of Kay Faraday's memory.\nGumshoe:\nDidn't you doubt it until just now, pal!?\nCourtney:\nCourtney:\nCongratulations, Ms. Faraday. Your courage will surely allow you to be forgiven. Now, let us rejoice in the blessings of the Goddess of Law!\nFranziska:\nFranziska:\nAllow me to give my opinion as an international prosecutor! Her actions as a criminal are...\nCourtney:\nCourtney:\nHurry! Arrest Kay Faraday at once!\nFranziska:\nHow dare you behave that way before me...!?\nEdgeworth:\nYou're being too forceful! Further verification is necessary! I'd even go so far to say this is unlawful!\nCourtney:\nUnfortunately, the law does not side with you.\nBlaise:\nIt sides with me, y'see. But y'know, the beautiful bond between you two has been etched deeply into my heart.\nCourtney:\nThat reminds me... we seem to have forgotten one additional suspect.\nBlaise:\nEdgeworth. That's you.\nGumshoe:\nWhat's that, pal!? Mr. Edgeworth hasn't done anything wrong!\nBlaise:\nI beg to differ! ...That's right. Y'see... He's no longer a prosecutor, sadly enough.\nCourtney:\nYour actions have gone too far this time. An illegal investigation, and assisting in the escape of a criminal... I cannot even think of you as a former prosecutor! Now, humbly accept your punishment!\nEdgeworth:\nNgh...!\nBlaise:\nOh, yes, that's right. I believe the plan of today was to hold your hearing before the P.I.C. Why don't we leave the hearing for tomorrow. Even though the result is already crystal clear. You should think long and hard about what you've done. ...Very long and very hard.\nCourtney:\nCourt is now adjourned!\nTo be continued.\nApril 6Detention CenterHolding Cell\nEdgeworth:\n(This is the second time I've been in this cell... ...All of my evidence has been taken from me. The only thing I have left is Kay's Yatagarasu's badge. I'm worried about Kay... Is she alright?)\nKay:\n...the culprit... ...is me. I remember looking down... at the person in the red raincoat... Mr. Edgeworth! It was me! The culprit was me all along!\nEdgeworth:\n......\nGuard:\nYou have a visitor. Please hurry out.\nEdgeworth:\nA visitor? Who could it be...?\nGuard:\nSomeone by the name of Dick Gumshoe. Will you turn him down?\nEdgeworth:\n...No. (It will be hard to face him, though.)\nApril 6Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nGuard:\nWait there.\nEdgeworth:\n(Hm. He's not going to stay and keep watch...?)\n???:\nPardon me.\nEdgeworth:\nJudge Courtney!\nCourtney:\nHush. Please, have a seat.\nEdgeworth:\nWhy are you here? I was told the detective had come.\nCourtney:\nIf I didn't instruct them to tell you that, you wouldn't be sitting here right now.\nEdgeworth:\n(I can't think of anything she'd need from me at this point. I should try to figure out what she wants...)\nThe visit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourtney:\nYour visitation rights have been restricted to begin with.\nEdgeworth:\nIt's as if I'm some monstrous criminal... I suppose my credibility has hit rock bottom.\nCourtney:\nBut of course. Your friends have fared a little better though. That lawyer and that girl were both quite worked up.\nEdgeworth:\n(Mr. Shields and Ema...)\nCourtney:\nWhen I last saw them, they were giving one of the guards quite an earful.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat!? You don't mean...!\nCourtney:\nBe grateful. The Goddess of Law has been quite busy. They were spared punishment.\nEdgeworth:\n...It certainly seems like you have plenty of time for small talk.\nCourtney:\nOh, yes. Prosecutor von Karma is presently continuing the investigation. You were worried about them, right?\nEdgeworth:\n(I guess she saw right through me...)\nJudge Courtney's goal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Let's cut to the chase. Exactly what are you planning?\"\nPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYatagarasu's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourtney:\nIf it's about Kay Faraday, I believe she's being interrogated as we speak.\nEdgeworth:\nYou people... Do you have any idea what you're doing? How dare you arrest an innocent person!\nCourtney:\nThat's not a very nice thing to say... I would ask that you correct your statement. She is merely someone you want to believe is innocent. ...Am I wrong?\nEdgeworth:\nThere is no decisive evidence to prove that she's the culprit.\nCourtney:\nThere is no evidence to prove her innocence either... Enough of this. It's pointless.\nEdgeworth:\n...!\nCourtney:\nThe girl will be judged. There is nothing you can do to stop that. That's all there is to say about that. Now, let's get to the real issue at hand.\nEdgeworth:\nLet's cut to the chase. Exactly what are you planning?\nCourtney:\nI am not planning anything. There is merely a question I wish to ask.\nEdgeworth:\n...You're asking me?\nCourtney:\nYes, of course. Who else is here? Objectively speaking... you are a clever individual, and you have a sharp mind. As a prosecutor, you are highly talented and capable.\nEdgeworth:\nAre you being ironic? Your sarcasm falls short.\nCourtney:\nI am being completely sincere. And that is why I cannot understand. Take this case, for example. You're up against the P.I.C. There is no chance for you to come out on top. Even a child could understand. And yet, you...\nEdgeworth:\nHeh... Perhaps my younger self would not have done something so reckless. ...The me from before had power. That's why I thought justice was on my side. Just like you right now...\nCourtney:\n.....\nEdgeworth:\nHowever, because of a certain man, my self-centered sense of justice was broken down. Ever since then... I began to see people in a different sight. I'm able to serve as a prosecutor only because of the support of the people around me. People like Detective Gumshoe, and all the other investigators. And... Kay, as well. Honestly, even I'm surprised at how much I have changed...\nCourtney:\nI see... Is that how it is? I've come to understand you a little more.\nEdgeworth:\nUnderstand me? Not likely. Someone like you, who forces her own sense of justice onto others could never understand.\nCourtney:\n...I wonder about that. Is that what you think?\nEdgeworth:\n...?\nCourtney:\nIf I could say one thing... ...it would be that this conversation has been very interesting. ...That is all.\nEdgeworth:\n..........\nCourtney:\nOur conversation is coming to an end, however... I have one last thing to tell you. The date of your hearing has been set. I came here today to inform you. Today. In the P.I.C. meeting room. May you humbly accept your fate.\nEdgeworth:\n...If that's all you wanted to say, couldn't you have just sent a messenger?\nCourtney:\nThe holy words of the Goddess of Law simply cannot be entrusted to others. With that, Mr. Edgeworth, I bid you farewell. I shall be seeing you again later.\nApril 6Detention CenterHolding Cell\nBars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere's a poster hanging in the hallway. \"The Dice N' Silce Game! Roll the dice and decide your daily menu... The Dice N' Silce Game has been cancelled due to the warden's arrest. We sincerely apologize to everyone who was looking forward to it.\" (There's no need to apologize for canceling such a silly game!)\nSink\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(I mustn't neglect my personal appearance just because I'm in a holding cell. Prosecutor or not, this is my personal duty...) Hm? My collar is slightly bent! ........There. A well-groomed appearance reflects a well-groomed mind. (From here on, I'll need to focus myself more than ever!)\nDesk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(There's a dining menu sitting on the desk. It seems I can get food delivered if I pay for it.) ...Let's see. Moldy white bread lunch set. Switch to moldy whole-wheat bread for an extra dollar. Oatmeal and grits set meal. For a limited time, get extra gruel at no additional cost. (Thank goodness I'm not hungry right now...)\nToilet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n(There's a poster on the wall next to the toilet.) \"We are currently out of toilet paper. Please be prepared if you wish to use the toilet.\" (What does it mean by \"be prepared\"...!)\nBed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nIt's a simple bed. I don't expect it to be very comfortable to sleep on. (If it were Detective Gumshoe, he would probably snore loudly while sleeping like a dog. I may never get a chance to work with him again... However, this is the path I chose! I won't regret it!)\nWindow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThere are thick bars placed securely on the window. (That reminds me, I watched a movie that had iron bars just like these. It was about a plan to escape a prison by filing down the iron bars. Of course, I wouldn't do such a thing. I don't even have a file.) ...No. Even if I had one, I still wouldn't do it!\n(Examining bars, desk, and bed leads to:)\nEdgeworth:\n(Another visitor...?) Kay!\nKay:\nAh...\nEdgeworth:\nIt seems you're alright. I'm relieved... for now.\nBlaise:\nY'know, this is kinda touching... *Sob* *Sob* *Sob*\nEdgeworth:\nYou look a little down, Kay... Please, cheer up. You didn't do anything wrong. I guarantee it.\nKay:\n...Please, just accept it. I am a murderer.\nEdgeworth:\nThat's not true! Why won't you believe in yourself!?\nKay:\nWhat should I believe in? I mean... there's nothing...\nEdgeworth:\nThere's nothing to believe in? That's not true. Before you lost your memories, you literally jumped into my life. As a result, your words and actions have become engraved in my memories... That's the mark you left behind. How can you call that \"nothing\"? I believe in your innocence. That's why you must believe in yourself as well.\nKay:\n.....Thank you. But, it's no use. Look at all the misfortune I've brought upon you. If you can, please forget it all. Your memories of Kay Faraday...\nEdgeworth:\nKay!\nBlaise:\nY'know, this takes me back. In my youth, I too was a gallant...\nEdgeworth:\nIs this... the kind of justice that the P.I.C. seeks?\nBlaise:\nHmm... Justice, huh? I wonder...\nEdgeworth:\n(This man, what is he planning? Why is he pushing things forward so forcefully...? It all seems too unnatural. Is there a hidden agenda? There's no time left! It's all or nothing now!)\nBlaise:\nWell then, I must take my leave...\nEdgeworth:\nHold it!\nEdgeworth:\nNo matter how you look at it, Kay's arrest was unnatural... There must be something behind it.\n4 CHESS PIECES\nBlaise:\nHey, hey. I'm a busy man, y'know. I'm kind of a big deal, y'see. I trust this won't take up too much of my time.\nEdgeworth:\n(In order to make it out of this situation, I must break through his defenses!) There are plenty of things I want to ask, but my time is limited.  First, I'll ask about why he rushed the arrest. I have no intention of letting him push me around. I will overcome this difficult situation.\nBegin Logic Chess\nWhy did you rush her arrest...?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Why did you rush her arrest!? I would like a clear explanation.\"\nKay is not the culprit!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nKay is not the culprit!\nBlaise:\nMy, my. That's a rather bold claim, y'know? Anyone can shout objections at the top of their lungs, y'see. Mr. Former Prodigy Prosecutor.\nEdgeworth:\nUrgh...! It's no use... I don't have enough information! My chance will come, sooner or later...! And when it does, I mustn't let it slip by.\nLeads back to first\nEdgeworth:\nWhy did you rush her arrest!? I would like a clear explanation.\nBlaise:\nExplanation? What are you talking about?\nEdgeworth:\nDon't play dumb with me! You clearly did not follow the proper procedures!\nBlaise:\nOK, OK. Maybe you should pipe down a bit. Do you even know the position you're in?\nI'm a prosecutor!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHaven't you realized it yet? I have you cornered!\nBlaise:\nMy, my. I wonder what you're getting so excited about? I sure can't understand the high spirits all you young folks seem to have.\nEdgeworth:\n(Argh... That was a wasted remark.)

I have no intention of letting him push me around. I will overcome this difficult situation.\nLeads back to first\nEdgeworth:\nThings were going well, you say? That's a strange way to put it. It almost sounds as if you personally wanted Kay to be arrested... ...far more than necessary. Haven't you lost your impartiality?\n1 PIECE BROKEN\nBlaise:\nHmm, you think so? That certainly wasn't my intention, y'see... Edgeworth, my boy, you're reading too much into it.\nEdgeworth:\nHe skillfully avoided the issue... However, I still have some serious doubts about Kay's arrest. Next, I shall ask him if the investigation was sufficient. I can't miss even the tiniest piece of information. That's the only way to break through this situation!\nHow long did you investigate?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHow much time was spent on the investigation?\n\n\n\nBefore clearing \"Was it under your authority?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlaise:\nY'know, I wonder about that...? I don't really remember, y'see.\nEdgeworth:\nThere is no way I can accept such a careless answer!\nBlaise:\nLike I said, I don't remember. My memory's not as sharp as it used to be, y'see. Sometimes I even forgot my own son's name.\nEdgeworth:\nI don't care about your idiot son! I want your answer regarding the investigation!\nBlaise:\nY-Yes, he really is an idiot... Even though I don't remember raising him like that. *Sob* *Sob* *Sob*\nEdgeworth:\nThere's no end to this... He just keeps on dodging the question.

Was it under your authority!\nBlaise:\nMy, my. Do I really look that important?\nEdgeworth:\nThe Prosecutorial Investigation Committee Chairman... It's quite a prominent title. Not that I care much for it.\nBlaise:\nTh-That was rather blunt. I'm so shocked, I could cry...\nEdgeworth:\nI'm sorry... Flattery was never my forte.\nBlaise:\nI-If you keep talking me like that t-towards me... ...y-you'll never get your prosecutor's badge back, y'know...\n\n\n\nThat would be terrible!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHaven't you realized it yet?

It's far too naïve, y'see.\nEdgeworth:\nThe look in his eyes has changed! He might respond differently to some of my questions now. This is my chance!\nLeads back to first\nWas it under your authority? (after clearing this option)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nI've run this line of questioning to its conclusion...

There was clearly no basis for Kay's arrest.\nBlaise:\nMy, my. Have you forgotten? Wasn't there evidence? The mask, the letter, and the corsage... All were found in the girl's possession. Not to mention, she even confessed. All of this serves to prove her crime.\nEdgeworth:\nThat's...\nBlaise:\n...Any objections?\n\n\n\nOBJECTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nHaven't you realized it yet?

Once you know the real value of the truth holds, I wonder if you can still say the same thing?\nEdgeworth:\n...What are you trying to say?\nBlaise:\nWhen you get to where I am, you can just create your own truths. Anytime you want. Kay Faraday is the culprit. That was a truth that I simply manufactured out of thin air.\nEdgeworth:\nNgh...!\nBlaise:\n...Good, very good. That face. That expression! You were such a desperate one, y'see. That's why I really wanted to bully you, y'know? Y'see, even if you know the truth, there is simply nothing you can do. And that's the real value of truth. So shocking that it's to die for, y'know?\nEdgeworth:\nWhy don't you pursue the true culprit!? How much of the truth do you know!?\nBlaise:\n...Do you understand now?

Y'know, I guess the friends of a heinous criminal are also quite heinous themselves.\nEdgeworth:\nBlaise! Yoooouuuuuuu!\nBlaise:\nAnd like this, y'see, one more person will disappear before me. Ahh, here come the waterworks. These tears of mine just won't stop, y'know.\nEdgeworth:\n(Everything will be decided in today's deliberation... Kay's innocence... I will definitely prove it!)\nApril 6, 8:30 AMGrand TowerP.I.C. Meeting Room\nBlaise:\nTen members are present. The quorum has been met... From here on out, let the council begin! Today's deliberation shall be about... Miles Edgeworth's aptitude and ability as a prosecutor! Let our members discuss this matter with a clear conscience of the Goddess of Law!\nEdgeworth:\n(A clear conscience... Don't make me laugh.)\nBlaise:\nCourtney, please give us your report.\nCourtney:\nOn April 5th, Prosecutor Edgeworth carried out an illegal investigation and resisted arrest. He was arrested by two of our members who caught him in the act: myself and Blaise Debeste. Prosecutor Edgeworth disrupted the investigation of Attorney Jill Crane's murder. He claims that the culprit, Kay Faraday, was arrested without sufficient evidence. Even now, his claim remains unchanged.\nBlaise:\nTell us more... about the murder incident.\nCourtney:\nOn April 5th, the victim's body was found here, in the P.I.C. meeting room. Regarding the details...\nDebeste:\nI, Sebastian Debeste, the best prosecutor, will enlighten you!\nCourtney:\nThe prosecutor in charge, Sebastian Debeste, will explain the rest of the details.\nDebeste:\nThe murder happened on the night of April 4th. The victim was one Jill Crane. On the same night, a black market auction was being held in this very meeting room. I guess Ms. Crane was taking part in the auction. Yup.\nCourtney:\nThe murder occurred in the middle of the auction, did it not?\nDebeste:\nWhen Ms. Crane was found, she was dressed like the Conductor of the auction. However, based on the fact that the auction continued after the murder occurred... ...I deduced that Ms. Crane could not have been the Conductor.\nEdgeworth:\n(You weren't the one who made that deduction...)\nCourtney:\nSebastian, please show everyone the basis for the arrest of the culprit.\nDebeste:\nYou got it, Justine. Kay Faraday was unable to bear the weight of her good conscience......\nCourtney:\nI believe you mean her \"guilty\" conscience.\nDebeste:\nYes. It was her guilty conscience that drove her to confess the crime. According to her confession, on the roof of this building... ...she met a figure in a red raincoat on the viewing platform.\nBlaise:\nSo Crane was wearing a red raincoat?\nCourtney:\nYes, that's correct. The culprit used the Conductor's clothes as a red herring to mislead us... At the time of the murder, Ms. Crane was wearing a red raincoat.\nDebeste:\nIt was I who discovered the raincoat near this building!\nEdgeworth:\n(He did? I'm sure it was the forensics team who found it...)\nCourtney:\nTo be more precise, it was the forensics team under Sebastian's orders who discovered it.\nEdgeworth:\n(I thought as much!)\nDebeste:\nAccording to the blood analysis... ...the person in the red raincoat and Ms. Crane were the same person! The decisive evidence is the culprit's own confession. She testified that she killed her! That's right, the culprit is Kay Faraday! It couldn't have been anyone else but her!\nBlaise:\nWell then, Edgeworth. If you have any objections, let's hear them.\nEdgeworth:\n.....I have no objections.\nBlaise:\nI see, I see. It seems all the fight's gone out of you after your little overnight stay...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nI have no objections to your claim that I investigated illegally. I admit to that. However! I object to the claim that Kay is the culprit!\nCourtney:\nCourtney:\nI will testify that Sebastian's investigation was fair and just.\nDebeste:\nHa ha ha ha ha! Of course it was, Justine! Don't you know that I'm the fairest of them all!\nBlaise:\nEdgeworth, my boy. Despite how things may seem, I actually kinda like you. If...! And this is just an \"if\", y'see. If you were to withdraw your objection... ...you might be sitting on this side of the bench tomorrow.\nEdgeworth:\n.........\nBlaise:\nI'll ask you one more time, Edgeworth. Do you have any objections?\nEdgeworth:\n...Don't take me for a fool.\nCourtney:\nI'd advise you to watch what you say!\nEdgeworth:\nThis man is the one who should watch what he's saying! I'm talking about the case! Not about a chair! I demand a testimony! By all means, let me hear that! I want to know how the P.I.C. understands this case!\nBlaise:\nA testimony from us, eh? Fine then. If that's what it takes to make you happy. Courtney, give him the materials from the investigation.\nCourtney:\nSir? But, that's...\nBlaise:\nIt's the end of the line for him. I'll let him go out in a blaze of glory.\nCourtney:\n...If you insist, Mr. Chairman.\nReceived evidence from Judge Courtney.\nBlaise:\nWhy don't we have... Courtney give the testimony?\nEdgeworth:\nI have no objections.\nKay:\nM-Mr. Edgeworth...\nEdgeworth:\nDon't worry, Kay. You just watch from over there.\n-- Summary of the Case --\nCourtney:\nMs. Crane went to the black market auction as a customer.\nThe red raincoat was one of the items up for auction...\nWe believe that she left her seat after winning the bid for it.\nThe only exit from the storeroom is the hatch that leads to the viewing platform.\nMs. Crane went out to the viewing platform, where she was attacked by Kay Faraday.\nThat was how she met her end. And that concludes my summary of the case.\nEdgeworth:\nThe red raincoat was up for auction...? Is that a fact?\nCourtney:\nIt is quite likely. The red raincoat had been a piece of evidence... ...in the assassination attempt on the President of Zheng Fa, as you well know. Originally, it should have been stored in an appropriate place... But when I asked about it... I learned that it went missing.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd it somehow made its way to the black market auction... Certainly, a natural conclusion.\nBlaise:\nMy, my. Well done, Courtney. Your explanation is as clear as ever.\nCourtney:\n...I am much obliged. Prosecutor Edgeworth, will you concede defeat now?\nEdgeworth:\nHeh. Sorry, but I don't plan on it.\nCourtney:\nI see... I am relieved.\nEdgeworth:\n(...Relieved? What does she mean? Come to think of it... Her reason for questioning me yesterday remains a mystery. Just what is she thinking?)\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: So you're saying that a member of the P.I.C. was involved in illicit dealings? Courtney: Regarding that... I... I have no response. Blaise: He's right, y'know. After this hearing is over, we're going to have to clean up our act. Courtney: A splendid decision, Mr. Chairman! Blaise: Now, now. It is only natural, y'see. There's no need to flatter me, y'know? But, y'know, that has nothing to do with you at all, Edgeworth. Because by then, you won't even be a prosecutor anymore, y'see? Well, now that this tearful business has been cleared up... Courtney: Yes, sir. I will continue.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: So, the red raincoat was also up for auction? Courtney: Yes. It had belonged to Shelly de Killer. Blaise: Based on the circumstances, we must consider that it was an item up for auction, y'see? Edgeworth: ! That was what he wore when he targeted the president of Zheng Fa...! (There was a mannequin that was positioned unnaturally amongst the auction goods... That may have been where the red raincoat had been on display.) Do you know how the goods were procured? Courtney: We're currently investigating it... But, it's none of your concern, Prosecutor Edgeworth. Soon, you will be nothing more than an ordinary individual. And then you will be finished. Edgeworth: (It seems the results of this deliberation have already been decided.) ...Enough about me. Please continue your testimony. Courtney: Since the raincoat had been up for auction...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Why would the victim immediately leave her seat? Courtney: That had to do with how the auction was conducted. It seems that after the winning bid, the winner was required to pay for the item immediately. Edgeworth: (That matches up with Ms. Hart's testimony.) Courtney: We believe that Ms. Crane paid her bid for the raincoat... ...and then immediately tried to leave the auction.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: The victim was a P.I.C. member. Couldn't she have also just left from the meeting room? Courtney: If she had done so during the auction... ...then its existence would have been revealed to the public. Edgeworth: (Since Ms. Hart knew about it, it seems the cat is already out of the bag...) Courtney: The customers were required to enter and exit from the hatch. Ms. Crane was simply following protocol... Considering where the murder took place, she must have tried to leave through there.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Why would Kay do such a thing? Courtney: We intend to question her about that later. Edgeworth: \"Later?\" That seems to be your favorite time for interrogations. Courtney: If the culprit was aware that the customers were required to exit from the hatch... ...it would have been easy to lie in wait for an ambush. Ms. Crane was attacked when she was leaving the hatch...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: \"Met her end\", what do you mean by that? Courtney: She passed away... or to be more precise, she was murdered. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The candelabra was one of the items in the auction. Therefore, Kay should not have been able to get her hands on it. Courtney: Courtney: If she was able to lie in wait for the attack, then she must have known about the storeroom. If she sneaked into the storeroom during the auction, she could have obtained it. Blaise: Now, if we only had some way to know for sure... Where the candelabra was during the entire auction, y'know? How about it? Edgeworth: Hmph... There is... no such evidence... Courtney: My apologies. We hope to find that evidence soon. Blaise: Edgeworth. It's too bad, y'know? It seems you won't be able to use this line of attack.\nEdgeworth: (The victim encountered the culprit on top of the roof and the crime occurred there... According to her reasoning, the murder took place at the viewing platform. But was that really the case? Some piece of evidence must tell the whole story behind it. I should try looking again.)",

I... I have no response.\nBlaise:\nHe's right, y'know. After this hearing is over, we're going to have to clean up our act.\nCourtney:\nA splendid decision, Mr. Chairman!\nBlaise:\nNow, now. It is only natural, y'see. There's no need to flatter me, y'know? But, y'know, that has nothing to do with you at all, Edgeworth. Because by then, you won't even be a prosecutor anymore, y'see? Well, now that this tearful business has been cleared up...\nCourtney:\nYes, sir. I will continue.\nCourtney:\nThe red raincoat was one of the items up for auction...\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nSo, the red raincoat was also up for auction?\nCourtney:\nYes. It had belonged to Shelly de Killer.\nBlaise:\nBased on the circumstances, we must consider that it was an item up for auction, y'see?\nEdgeworth:\n! That was what he wore when he targeted the president of Zheng Fa...! (There was a mannequin that was positioned unnaturally amongst the auction goods... That may have been where the red raincoat had been on display.) Do you know how the goods were procured?\nCourtney:\nWe're currently investigating it... But, it's none of your concern, Prosecutor Edgeworth. Soon, you will be nothing more than an ordinary individual. And then you will be finished.\nEdgeworth:\n(It seems the results of this deliberation have already been decided.) ...Enough about me. Please continue your testimony.\nCourtney:\nSince the raincoat had been up for auction...\nCourtney:\nWe believe that she left her seat after winning the bid for it.\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhy would the victim immediately leave her seat?\nCourtney:\nThat had to do with how the auction was conducted. It seems that after the winning bid, the winner was required to pay for the item immediately.\nEdgeworth:\n(That matches up with Ms. Hart's testimony.)\nCourtney:\nWe believe that Ms. Crane paid her bid for the raincoat... ...and then immediately tried to leave the auction.\nCourtney:\nThe only exit from the storeroom is the hatch that leads to the viewing platform.\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe victim was a P.I.C. member. Couldn't she have also just left from the meeting room?\nCourtney:\nIf she had done so during the auction... ...then its existence would have been revealed to the public.\nEdgeworth:\n(Since Ms. Hart knew about it, it seems the cat is already out of the bag...)\nCourtney:\nThe customers were required to enter and exit from the hatch. Ms. Crane was simply following protocol... Considering where the murder took place, she must have tried to leave through there.\nCourtney:\nMs. Crane went out to the viewing platform, where she was attacked by Kay Faraday.\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWhy would Kay do such a thing?\nCourtney:\nWe intend to question her about that later.\nEdgeworth:\n\"Later?\" That seems to be your favorite time for interrogations.\nCourtney:\nIf the culprit was aware that the customers were required to exit from the hatch... ...it would have been easy to lie in wait for an ambush. Ms. Crane was attacked when she was leaving the hatch...\nPresent Lotta's Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Judge Courtney, I have found it to be strange for a while now.\"\nCourtney:\nThat was how she met her end. And that concludes my summary of the case.\nPress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n\"Met her end\", what do you mean by that?\nCourtney:\nShe passed away... or to be more precise, she was murdered.\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe candelabra was one of the items in the auction. Therefore, Kay should not have been able to get her hands on it.\nCourtney:\n\nCourtney:\nIf she was able to lie in wait for the attack, then she must have known about the storeroom. If she sneaked into the storeroom during the auction, she could have obtained it.\nBlaise:\nNow, if we only had some way to know for sure... Where the candelabra was during the entire auction, y'know? How about it?\nEdgeworth:\nHmph... There is... no such evidence...\nCourtney:\nMy apologies. We hope to find that evidence soon.\nBlaise:\nEdgeworth. It's too bad, y'know? It seems you won't be able to use this line of attack.\nEdgeworth:\n(The victim encountered the culprit on top of the roof and the crime occurred there... According to her reasoning, the murder took place at the viewing platform. But was that really the case? Some piece of evidence must tell the whole story behind it. I should try looking again.)\nEdgeworth:\nJudge Courtney, I have found it to be strange for a while now. Why is Ms. Hart here with us?\nCourtney:\nShe is an eyewitness to this case. Isn't it only natural for her to be in attendance?\nLotta:\nAww... shucks, ha ha... I reckon I'm more of an earwitness than an eyewitness.\nEdgeworth:\n...Heh. It seems that gaining the trust of others isn't your strong point, Judge Courtney.\nCourtney:\nPerhaps I simply do not wish to be as tactless as you.\nEdgeworth:\nIt appears you have failed to get the witness to tell you the most vital information. Please look at this photo. This was taken by Ms. Hart.\nCourtney:\nThis photo seems to have been taken in the storeroom. And, what of it?\nEdgeworth:\nAccording to your reasoning, the incident took place on the viewing platform. However, Ms. hart encountered the incident in the storeroom! That's right, it had taken place just before this photo was taken!\nDebeste:\nW-Wait...! If that's true, then Justine's reasoning...!\nEdgeworth:\nExactly, it does not hold up.\nDebeste:\nWh-Whaaaaaaaaat!\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Hart, allow me to ask you again. You saw the person in the photo with your own eyes, correct?\nLotta:\nI sure did. I seen 'em plain as day with my own two eyes.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd what did you think at the time?\nLotta:\nI figured I was about to get me a big scoop! ...Ya know?\nEdgeworth:\n.........\nDebeste:\nI guess that makes sense.\nEdgeworth:\n...Ahem. That's not what I meant. What did you think of that person?\nLotta:\nHuh? Well... I reckoned she'd help me bring home the bacon.\nEdgeworth:\n...Are you mocking me?\nLotta:\nAww shucks, don't make that scary ole' face. It was just a harmless little joke. The person in the red raincoat? I reckoned they were the culprit.\nEdgeworth:\nI hope you understand now. The crime occurred in the...\nCourtney:\nCourtney:\nProsecutor Edgeworth, I cannot understand your argument if you do not say it out loud. If you had simply asked, I would have been more than willing to explain.\nEdgeworth:\n...Explain what?\nCourtney:\nThe sounds Ms. Hart heard may not necessarily be related to the case.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nThat is impossible! Enough of your excuses!\nCourtney:\nWas the voice that Ms. Hart heard really that of Ms. Crane?\nLotta:\nSuch a shady conversation must've had somethin' to do with the case!\nCourtney:\nWhat did her voice sound like?\nLotta:\nH-Her voice? Well... it beats me. How was I suppos'd to know!? They were both usin' voice changers.\nCourtney:\nYes. The voices Ms. Hart heard had been altered by a device. We must therefore question whether or not they have any bearing on this case.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\n......Hmph.\nCourtney:\nYou need not object just because you wish to sigh.\nEdgeworth:\nJudge Courtney, it seems I have greatly overestimated you.\nBlaise:\nNo, no. Courtney is quite amazing, y'see.\nEdgeworth:\nYou claim that the sounds Ms. Hart heard no bearing on this case? Even if they do not, it doesn't change the fact that the crime took place in the storeroom. At the very least, the crime must have occurred before the victim went up to the rooftop. The reason being... This evidence proves the crime occurred before the victim went up to the viewing platform!\nPresent bloodied hand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"At first, I thought the person in the red raincoat was the culprit.\"\nPresent anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nJudge Courtney. Could you take a look at this area?\nCourtney:\nProsecutor Edgeworth. What area are you referring to?\nEdgeworth:\nUmm... Around here somewhere?\nCourtney:\nPlease be more specific!\nEdgeworth:\nArgh! (It seems I was wrong. This photo was taken after Ms. Harts heard the sounds in the storeroom. There must be something in the photo that connects the sounds to the case!)\nCourtney:\nAs I thought, you cannot show the connection between the sounds and the case.\nEdgeworth:\nJudge Courtney. That is not true.\nLeads back to:\n\"This evidence proves the crime occurred before the victim went up to the viewing platform!\"\nEdgeworth:\nAt first, I thought the person in the red raincoat was the culprit.\nKay:\nWell... Ms. Hart's testimony certainly made it sound that way...\nEdgeworth:\nPrecisely. It was because she saw that the person's hand... was covered in blood. Anyone who heard her testimony would have arrived at the same conclusion. The person in the red raincoat was the culprit... and the blood on their hand was the victim's. However, if the person in the red raincoat was the victim, then the situation changes completely. Since blood can be seen in this photo, it must have been taken after the crime occurred. It seems we've been under the wrong impression in regards to the victim's condition. This photo shows the true condition of the victim. The victim...\nWas really the Conductor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe victim was the Conductor of the black market auction!\nKay:\nAccording to what Ms. Hart said, even after the victim was hit... ...the auction still went on, right?\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. That is correct.\nKay:\nSo wouldn't it be impossible for the victim to have been the Conductor?\nEdgeworth:\nNnghoooh! (I overlooked that...)\nKay:\nThis photo was taken after Ms. Hart heard the sounds in the storeroom. In that case, the blood on that hand must mean...\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. There is only one answer. In other words, the victim...\nLeads back to:\n\"This photo shows the true condition of the victim. The victim...\"\nStruck the culprit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe victim struck the culprit! That was probably when her hand got covered in blood.\nCourtney:\nProsecutor Edgeworth. All the blood we found at the crime scene belonged to the victim. Your reasoning doesn't seem to hold up.\nEdgeworth:\nNnghoooh! (I overlooked that...)\nKay:\nThis photo was taken after Ms. Hart heard the sounds in the storeroom. In that case, the blood on that hand must mean...\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. There is only one answer. In other words, the victim...\nLeads back to:\n\"This photo shows the true condition of the victim. The victim...\"\nWas still alive after the attack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The victim was definitely attacked in the storeroom.\"\nEdgeworth:\nThe victim was definitely attacked in the storeroom. Immediately afterward, the victim was seen with blood on her hand. That must mean... ...the victim was still alive even after she was attacked. The blood on her hand must have come from her own wound.\nDebeste:\nNo way! Are you saying that she died from a hand injury?\nEdgeworth:\nNo, that is not the case. I suspect she just held her hand against the wound. It can't be seen in the photo, but at this moment, she must have already suffered a fatal wound.\nBlaise:\nHoh, hoh. If that's true, then it changes a lot of things, y'know?\nEdgeworth:\nIt seems you understand. This refutes the allegations against Kay. Kay encountered the victim after this picture was taken... I believe at that point in time, the victim was already on the verge of death. It's likely Kay just happened to be present when the victim reached the end of her strength.\nCourtney:\n...That is quite the coincidence.\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. I can only say that she was at the wrong place at the wrong time.\nCourtney:\nProsecutor Edgeworth, it seems you have forgotten a crucial fact.\nBlaise:\nAh, you mean that, right? He must be pretending that he hasn't noticed it, y'see.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat did you say...? Are you implying that I forgot something?\nBlaise:\nCourtney. I think it's about time you gave him his last rites.\nDebeste:\nHey, pops! Justine's with me, you know! Don't order her around like that!\nBlaise:\nY'know... even though you're my son, you're so embarrassing.\nDebeste:\nI'm not embarrassing!\nEdgeworth:\n(...I'm sorry, but you're both rather embarrassing.)\nDebeste:\nJustine! Give Mr. Edgeworth his... umm...\nCourtney:\nVery well. I shall give him his last rites.\n-- Edgeworth's Contradiction --\nCourtney:\nWhen the body was found, there were three wounds in Ms. Crane's chest.\nI'm sure you're well aware what kind of wounds these were, right?\nYes, she was stabbed in the heart with the three-pronged candelabra.\nIs there any person who could survive such an injury?\nPlease take a close look at the autopsy report. Can you still say the same thing after reading it?\nDebeste:\nWell done, Justine! With this, Mr. Edgeworth will...\nEdgeworth:\nI will offer a rebuttal, of course.\nDebeste:\nWhy would you do that!? Didn't you hear what Justine just said?\nEdgeworth:\nOf course, I did. And I still plan to object to it.\nDebeste:\nIt's not faaaaaiiiir! You're always opposing me at every turn!\nEdgeworth:\nIt was never my intention to oppose you.\nDebeste:\n.....Huh? R-Really?\nEdgeworth:\n(It's simply not worth my time.)\nDebeste:\nI-I see. So that's how it is. Yup, yup. After all, I'm...\nBlaise:\nThat's enough, y'know. You're embarrassing your father, y'see.\nDebeste:\nHuh!? What do you mean, pops!?\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Three wounds... That sounds rather painful. Courtney: Indeed... We must punish the culprit accordingly. Kay: I-I... Edgeworth: ...Kay. Do not listen to what she says. Judge Courtney. Please continue your reasoning. Courtney: Very well. She had three wounds...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Why don't you ask Sebastian instead? Courtney: Of course, Sebastian knows all about it. Debeste: Huh? Me? Yeah! I know everything! Edgeworth: (...He's obviously lying.) Blaise: Sebastian, maybe you should sneak a peek at the autopsy report, y'know? Debeste: Ummm..... Let's see here... The fatal wound was caused by the candelabra. Oooh! So that's how it was! Courtney: ...Ahem! The cause of the wound was just as Sebastian said.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: So the cause of death was a stab wound to the heart... Is that correct? Courtney: Yes, the candelabra pierced right into her heart. Since this was Dr. Young's medical opinion, it must be truth. Debeste: The coroner's medical opinion follows my own opinion. Therefore... it's perfect. Edgeworth: I certainly cannot ignore the autopsy reports, however... Debeste: Hey! Don't ignore my opinion! Edgeworth: (However, if the cause of death was a stab wound to the victim's chest... ...wouldn't it contradict that piece of evidence...?) Debeste: Oooh... He's totally ignoring me! Justine! Say something! Courtney: Yes. I will not allow you to ignore my reasoning.\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: At the very least... we cannot be certain that she died instantly. Courtney: Even if she still had a little bit of life left, I doubt she would have held on for long. Kay: Umm, can people survive after being stabbed in the chest? Debeste: In some cases, maybe they can. ...Although, maybe they can't. Kay: Huh... So in the end, which one is it? Courtney: ...No such human exists. If you think they do, then first...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: According to the autopsy report, the stab wounds to the left chest caused the fatality. Courtney: Correct. The autopsy report itself is the foundation for my reasoning. Edgeworth: In other words... I just have to shatter that foundation, right? Courtney: I don't find that amusing at all... I look forward to seeing you try. Nevertheless, please take a close look at the autopsy report before you make a rebuttal. Show me that your reasoning is not just mere conjecture. Edgeworth: ...Very well.\nKay: Umm... Mr. Edgeworth...\nEdgeworth: We'll be fine, Kay. There's nothing for you to worry about. (Evidence that the victim was alive after the incident... If I can just find that, Kay will be...!)",

How about it, Courtney?\nCourtney:\nThe victim... Ms. Crane was wearing this earlier. Prosecutor Edgeworth. Must I repeat my explanation to you all over again?\nEdgeworth:\nI suppose it just might come to that. Judge Courtney, answer me this. This red raincoat was stained with blood... Do you happen to remember where specifically those bloodstains were located?\nCourtney:\nOf course I do. They were on the hood... W-Wait, it can't be!\nBlaise:\nHm? What does this mean?\nEdgeworth:\nJudge Courtney, were there any other bloodstains besides the ones on the hood?\nCourtney:\nNone... were detected.\nEdgeworth:\nDon't you think it's strange? The victim died from a stab wound to the chest. In that case, there should have been bloodstains on the front of the raincoat. However... the only blood they found was on the hood! This is a huge contradiction! The wound on the victim's head is no ordinary wound. After all, the victim sustained this wound before she was stabbed in the chest.\nCourtney:\n...It does appear that way, doesn't it? The victim first suffered the head wound. If she had already been stabbed in the chest, the raincoat would have been stained with blood... Therefore, it is unthinkable that her chest was stabbed before she stuffed the head wound. So the order of the wounds would be: first the head, followed by the chest. However, does that really change the situation?\nEdgeworth:\nWith this, a contradiction is born. One that overturns all of our assumptions up until now...\nCourtney:\nIs the change really that great? I look forward to hearing it. Well then, this contradiction, why don't you show it to me? With evidence!\nEdgeworth:\nWhich piece of evidence shows the contradiction that arises from the order of the wounds?\nPresent Autopsy Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This is the autopsy report written by Dr. Young.\"\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis piece of evidence shows the huge contradiction.\nCourtney:\nI have absolutely no idea what you are trying to say.\nKay:\nI'm sorry, me too...\nLotta:\nSame here!\nDebeste:\n...M-Me too!\nEdgeworth:\nGwaaah! (So it wasn't this!? ...It is unthinkable that her chest was stabbed before she suffered the head wound. And thus, a major contradiction is born within that piece of evidence.)\nCourtney:\nProsecutor Edgeworth. There was no contradiction after all, was there?\nEdgeworth:\nOn the contrary, Judge Courtney. If the victim sustained her head wound before she was stabbed in the chest... ...a huge contradiction arises.\nLeads back to:\n\"Which piece of evidence shows the contradiction that arises from the order of the wounds?\"\nEdgeworth:\nThis is the autopsy report written by Dr. Young. According to this... ...the head wound was postmortem.\nCourtney:\nBut that's not what the raincoat shows...\nEdgeworth:\nExactly, it's the exact opposite.\nCourtney:\nBailiff! Hurry and summon Dr. Bonnie Young at once!  Until we hear what she has to say, we cannot close the curtains on this case!\nOfficer:\nYes, ma'am! Understood!\nCourtney:\nDr. Young is a busy person. It will take some time for her to arrive. In the meantime... let us try viewing this case from another angle. There's something that's been on my mind. One of the key figures in this case... The \"Conductor\". We still don't know who that person is.\nDebeste:\nNow that you mention it! Even after our investigation, we still have no idea who it is.\nCourtney:\nThe Conductor has come up time and time again during this hearing. However, at this point in time, their identity remains a mystery. How about it? Do you have any ideas?\nEdgeworth:\nI'm still not sure at the moment. However... ...there is someone I have in mind. A certain individual involved with this case, who might know something about it.\nDebeste:\nWho's that...?\nEdgeworth:\nBlaise Debeste! I demand your testimony!\nDebeste:\nWh-Whaaaaaaaaat!\nBlaise:\n........\nDebeste:\nDon't say such a stupid thing! Why would you suspect pops!?\nCourtney:\nAre you trying to cast suspicion towards the Chairman of the P.I.C.? Do you understand... what that means?\nEdgeworth:\nStatus and prestige mean nothing before the truth. That man is trying to pin the crime on Kay! The evidence that was in Kay's possession: the ticket stub, the mask, the corsage... These items did not come into her possession out of her own volition. By some method, that man purposely planted them on her personage.\nCourtney:\n........ It is hard to believe such a sudden accusation... but I'll ask just in case. Why... would he do that?\nEdgeworth:\nObviously, to direct suspicion towards Kay. I succeeded in drawing out those words from him earlier.\nCourtney:\nMr. Chairman, your response?\nBlaise:\n.........\nEdgeworth:\nAre you too shocked to speak?\nBlaise:\n.....And what of it?\nEdgeworth:\n...?\nBlaise:\nPerhaps you didn't hear me. I said, \"What of it?\" You say that you drew out some words from me, but you don't have a shred of proof, y'know? No one else heard it but you. It just doesn't work like that, y'see. Or do you have something else? Y'know, some kind of basis for your argument?\nEdgeworth:\n(This confidence... He also showed it at the cell...)\nCourtney:\nProsecutor Edgeworth. I would like you to explain once more. I trust we have your permission, Mr. Chairman.\nBlaise:\nBut of course. I'm pretty interested in this matter myself, y'know. I'd like to know just what part of me semes criminal to Edgeworth. There's no one as honest as I am, y'see.\nEdgeworth:\n(How can he say that with a straight face...?) Let's start from the top... The fact that the auction was held in this room is a cause for suspicion. This is the P.I.C. meeting room. I imagine it would be difficult for non-members to enter.\nDebeste:\nThat's why... all the members have keycards, you know.\nEdgeworth:\nI think we can assume that multiple auctions have been held here before. Therefore, suspecting a member of the P.I.C. would be...\nDebeste:\n...Debeste!\nEdgeworth:\nY-Yes. Because the Conductor had to have been a P.I.C. member.\nDebeste:\nWait! Nooooooooooo!\nEdgeworth:\nWha... (What was that all about!?)\nDebeste:\nWh-What do I do, pops? I just helped the enemy!\nBlaise:\nAh ha ha ha ha. Sebastian really is an idiot, y'know. But y'see, Edgeworth, I'm not the only one with access, y'know?\nCourtney:\nIndeed... There are eleven members in the P.I.C. Even if we rule out the victim, Ms. Crane... there are still ten potential suspects.\nIt's not me!\nB-B-B-But, it couldn't be the Ch-Ch-Ch-Chairman, right?\nI don't know who it is, but whoever it is should just come forward!\nBlaise:\nYes, yes. Everyone, just calm down, y'know? Edgeworth, is that all you got? Where's the evidence to suspect me?\nEdgeworth:\n......\nBlaise:\nOh? So you've fallen silent. But you've gone too far, y'see. I won't forgive you anymore. It's too late for regrets, y'know? I'm a very important man, y'see. Former Chief Prosecutor and Chairman of the P.I.C.!\nEdgeworth:\nNgh...\nBlaise:\nIt's fine if you're not prepared to face the fire, y'know. 'Cause y'see... ...either way, it won't make any difference.\n-- 'Cause I'm Gonna Bully You --\nBlaise:\nYou've been rambling on for quite a while about the most trivial details, y'know?\nLike the location of the murder, the order of the wounds and... Hrmm, what else was there?\nIt just doesn't matter, y'know. 'Cause y'see, none of that means anything, y'know.\nThink about it. We've got the suspect herself saying she killed the victim.\nThat's all that matters, y'see. She'll even get a lighter sentence with her confession, y'know.\nBlaise:\nNow then. If there are any contradictions, be my quest.\nEdgeworth:\n(How can that be considered a testimony!? There must be a contradiction somewhere...)\nKay:\nThat person... He's very important, isn't he? Mr. Edgeworth... It's alright. Let's just give up... Surely, I must have killed her... I can even remember it...\nEdgeworth:\nDon't be tied down by your muddled memories. If you want to believe in something... ...believe in your own innocence. Believe me, who believes in you!\nKay:\nBut...\nEdgeworth:\n(My opponent is the P.I.C. Chairman. Taking him down won't be easy. However... ...he has underestimated me. If I can take advantage of that...!)\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: If these trivial details create contradictions in the case, we cannot call it the truth. Blaise: It's fine, as long as the rest of the case makes sense, y'know. Every case is going to have a small contradiction or two, y'see. But, if we get bogged down by the details, we won't be able to arrest the criminal. Trials would go on forever, y'see. You, of all people, should understand, y'know. Edgeworth: I don't, that's why I'm asking you. Blaise: Ah, young folks these days. Anyways, you were rambling on about stuff...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: The autopsy report, and the questions about the Conductor. ...Were you even listening? Blaise: Talk is cheap, y'know. I was listening, y'see. But I didn't think much of it, y'know. Edgeworth: You didn't think much of it, even after I brought up all those issues...? Perhaps your judgement needs to be questioned, rather than my ability as a prosecutor. Blaise: Ah ha ha. That's a good one, Edgeworth. But y'see...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: How can you say it doesn't matter!? Are you trying to suppress the truth!? Blaise: Well, y'see. It simply doesn't matter as much as you say it does, y'know. Y'see, Edgeworth. You're only saying it matters to avoid the real issue here.\nEdgeworth: Leads to: \"It may be true she confessed, however, that does not make it the truth!\"\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: I wouldn't call that a confession. You probably forced her to say it, didn't you? Blaise: Even if you say that, y'know. What do you think, Courtney? Courtney: Yes, sir. There is no doubt, she confessed to her own sin. Blaise: Y'see, Edgeworth. I know you want to believe in Kay Faraday. But, y'know, to deny her own confession, I'm not sure what to make of that, y'see. It just means that you don't really trust her, y'know? Edgeworth: What did you say...!? Blaise: Oh my, what scary eyes you have. Please don't devour me. Ah ha ha ha...\nEdgeworth: (There is no way there is a contradiction in a testimony like this. He has underestimated me. If I can take advantage of that...!)",

So we must question the credibility of her testimony.\nBlaise:\nBlaise:\nEven if you say that, y'know, it still won't solve anything. What good will it do to deny her confession? Sounds like nonsense to me. Wanna try asking her again? I think she'll just say that she's the murderer again, though.\nEdgeworth:\n...Very well. Let's try asking her again, one last time. I'd like to hear from Kay herself. Whether or not she is the culprit.\nKay:\nHuh...? From... me?\nCourtney:\nWill that be alright? If this goes poorly, it will be quite unfavorable for you...\nEdgeworth:\nI do not mind. However... I shall ask Kay the question myself.\nBlaise:\n......I'm moved to tears, y'know. Oh, how touching, y'know, how very touching! Fine then, I'll let you ask her. However, I have one condition. If all this proves to be a waste of time... ...then that will be the end of it. How's that sound?\nDebeste:\nThe end... of the hearing?\nBlaise:\nYes, yes. It seems you can be smart once in a while, Sebastian. In other words, y'see, if she confesses again... ...Kay Faraday will be found, beyond a shadow of a doubt, guilty. Yup. It's a fine idea.\nEdgeworth:\nGuilty, beyond a shadow of a doubt?\nBlaise:\nYeah, that's right.\nEdgeworth:\n(That's harsh... but either way, if I do nothing, she'll be declared guilty.) Kay!\nKay:\nY-Yes!\nEdgeworth:\nI know what I'm asking of you is unreasonable, but please, I want you to answer me. It doesn't matter how tiny it is. Do you... Do you remember anything? Anything that would prove your innocence...!\nKay:\n...Why? Why would you go that far, for me...? I... I can't do it. .....I'm sorry. .....I'm too scared to remember. Because... I might have done something even worse. If that were the case... ...I would only make things worse for you, Mr. Edgeworth. Kay Faraday must have been a despicable criminal... Someone who betrayed your trust...!\nEdgeworth:\n.....Don't worry. We've only known each other for a short while... but I know you very well. I'd even say that I know you better than yourself, now that you've lost your memories. You cannot possibly be the culprit.

I would like you to look at this. This is your true identity!\nKay:\n...I'm sorry, I don't remember anything...\nEdgeworth:\nNnghhoooh! (So this wasn't related at all...)\nKay:\nMr. Edgeworth... I think I don't want to remember anything after all! I might have done something even worse than murder.\nEdgeworth:\n...Kay. Don't worry!\nLeads back to:\n\"You cannot possibly be the culprit. Because, your true identity is...!\"\nEdgeworth:\n...the Great Thief Yatagarasu. The Yatagarasu is a noble thief who would never stoop to murder.\nKay:\n...! .........................No. It's useless. After all...! No matter what, that memory still remains... This image that's stuck in my head... I just can't get rid of it! That means, I must have...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nThere's no clear evidence to prove that you're the culprit, besides your own confession. Remember what I said? You must believe in yourself. Or perhaps... you cannot trust my words?\nKay:\n.....No. That's not it. It's because, you are... trying to save someone like me. You've already lost so much... All for my sake... I can't bear it anymore... Please... Please just give up.\nEdgeworth:\nI see now..... I thought it was strange. The reason you were acting like you wanted to be found guilty... ...was because you were concerned about me... That is just like you, Kay.\nKay:\nIt's because... you're a good person, Mr. Edgeworth...\nEdgeworth:\nUnfortunately... I may fall short of your expectations. I am not trying to be a good person. No matter how much you may want me to give up... I'll keep trying to save you. That is the nature of who I am. Whether or not it is a burden for you is none of my concern.\nKay:\n........\nEdgeworth:\nKay, believe in yourself once more. You are a noble Great Thief. What you should be doubting is your memory of committing the murder. That is my wish, above all else. ......Please.\nKay:\nI........ ......! AAAAAHHHHHH!\nEdgeworth:\nKay!\nKay:\n.........\nCourtney:\nWhat is it? Did you remember something?\nBlaise:\nIf she remembers something now... Ha ha ha, it'd be like a bad movie.\nKay:\n........Bull.\nEdgeworth:\n.........\nCourtney:\n.........\nDebeste:\nB... Bull...?\nCourtney:\n...Prosecutor Edgeworth. Please ask her to clarify.\nEdgeworth:\nE-Erm, well, Kay. What do you mean by \"bull\"...?\nKay:\nI remember now! The person in the red raincoat had that with her! The stuffed bull doll! I'm certain of it!!\nEdgeworth:\nIs that tr-\nCourtney:\nIs that true, Defendant!?\nKay:\nYes, your Honor!\nCourtney:\nThe Court hereby accepts the defendant's statement as a new piece of testimony.\nBlaise:\nBlaise:\nQuit messing around, Courtney. A testimony like that cannot be accepted, y'know.\nCourtney:\nYour objection has been noted, sir. However, testimony about the victim's belongings...\nEdgeworth:\n...has been lacking up until now.\nBlaise:\nBlaise:\nNevertheless, y'know. Her vague memories cannot be trusted, y'know?\nCourtney:\nHer memories are vague? That would be bad for us as well. Didn't you say this earlier yourself, Mr. Chairman? Since we have the suspect's confession, we don't need to worry about the trivial details. If we decide to doubt her memories... ...then we must also doubt her confession, which is the main foundation of our case. Are you willing to do that, sir?\nBlaise:\n.....Aah. You're right. Well, never mind then. I shall leave it to you.\nCourtney:\nThank you very much.\nEdgeworth:\n(W-We did it. It was touch and go for a while there, though... ...however, those words of Judge Courtney just now... It almost feels as if... she is on our side...)\nCourtney:\nProsecutor Edgeworth, do you know anything about this stuffed animal?\nEdgeworth:\nThe stuffed animal Kay spoke of must have been this. We found it in the storeroom. It is believed to be one of the items for the auction.\nCourtney:\nThis is...!\nDebeste:\nHm? Do you know something about it, Justine?\nCourtney:\nN-No... It's just a bit different from what I imagined.\nEdgeworth:\n(Indeed... it's certainly not what I would have expected the victim to be carrying. Let's examine every suspicious-looking nook and cranny.)\nExamine Cherry petal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nA cherry blossom petal is stuck in its soft fur. Speaking of which, there were also some stuck on the red raincoat...\nKay:\nA cherry tree... Wasn't there one blossoming on the viewing platform?\nEdgeworth:\nYes. It seems safe to assume this was taken outside. (However... why would the victim be carrying something like this?)\nExamine left hole\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nThe left horn is missing.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm. There's a hole in this stuffed animal. It seems this hole is where the horn is inserted into.\nKay:\nI guess its head isn't stuffed with cotton. I wonder what's inside?\nEdgeworth:\n(Perhaps I should examine the other side.)\nExamine horn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The right horn seems to be fine... but the entire balance feels a bit off.\"\nEdgeworth:\nThe right horn seems to be fine... but the entire balance feels a bit off.\nKay:\nThis horn... It looks like you can move it.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat...!\n...*bzz*...*bzzz*...\nKay:\nWhat was that buzzing sound...?\nEdgeworth:\nIt seems this toy is equipped with a recording device.\n*bzzz*...*bzt*... And... th...\nBlaise:\n........\nI knew who you were right away. You can't hide that burn from me.\n........\nSilence, huh... I've been waiting for my chance to get revenge all this time!\nAAAAAAHHH... *bzz* ...*bzzz*...*bzt*...\nEdgeworth:\nIs this... the moment of the murder!?\nKay:\nWho could have recorded something like this?\nStuffed Animal data updated in my Organizer.\nLotta:\nTh... This is... There ain't no doubt about it! This here was what I heard!\nExamine evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamine cherry petal on Stuffed animal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nA cherry blossom petal is stuck in its soft fur. According to Kay's story, this had been dropped under the cherry tree. So it's no wonder that a cherry blossom petal had gotten caught in there.\n\n\n\n\nExamine left hole on Stuffed animal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKay:\nThe left horn is missing. Although I am curious as to the whereabouts of the missing horn... Even if we were to find it, repairing it would be no easy task.\n\n\n\n\nHorn on Stuffed Animal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWe can play back the audio that was recorded by twisting this horn.\n*bzzz*...*bzt*... And... th...\nI knew who you were right away. You can't hide that burn from me.\n........\nSilence, huh... I've been waiting for my chance to get revenge all this time!\nAAAAAAHHH... *bzz* ...*bzzz*...*bzt*...\nCourtney:\nCourtney:\nWe cannot verify when these voices were recorded. It's also possible that they aren't related to the case at all. If only we had some video as well...\nLotta:\nThat's hogwash! I'm tellin' ya, that right there was the conversation that I heard! The victim was holdin' on to it, right? I reckon it must've been recorded when she got attacked!\nCourtney:\nThat certainly is a possibility... However, your testimony alone is insufficient. I require something with a little more credibility.\nEdgeworth:\n(Again. Her words... It almost sounds as if she's trying to give me advice...) Judge Courtney. There's no mistake that those voices were from the incident. Please recall the audio that was recorded by the stuffed animal. \"I knew who you were right away. You can't hide that burn from me.\" If we compare this part of the recording with a certain piece of evidence... we can prove it. (This evidence shows that the recording took place during the moment of the crime...!)\nPresent Autopsy Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The autopsy report? And exactly what part of the autopsy report shows that?\"\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nJudge Courtney. What do you think of this piece of evidence?\nCourtney:\nPresenting something that has nothing to do with the recording will not do you any good.\nEdgeworth:\nUugh! (I could've sworn it was this...)\nCourtney:\nProsecutor Edgeworth. Is there really evidence to prove that the voices were recorded during the incident?\nLeads back to:\n\"Please recall the audio that was recorded by the stuffed animal.\"\nCourtney:\nThe autopsy report? And exactly what part of the autopsy report shows that?\nEdgeworth:\n(This part shows that the recording took place during the moment of the crime...!)\nPresent \"burn mark\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I remember clearly what that voice said...\"\nPresent anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nIf you look at this part of the autopsy report, I think you will understand...\nCourtney:\nSpecifically which part are you referring to?\nEdgeworth:\nUmm. Around here?\nCourtney:\nEven if you ask me, it will not do you any good.\nEdgeworth:\nGwaah! (I guess it wasn't here...)\nKay:\nWhy don't we listen to the contents of the recording one more time? There might be something important.\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. And it's also not too late to look over the autopsy report.\nCourtney:\nProsecutor Edgeworth. What part of the autopsy report shows that the voices were recorded during the incident?\nLeads back to:\n\"(This part shows that the recording took place during the moment of the crime...!)\"\nEdgeworth:\nI remember clearly what that voice said... \"You can't hide that burn from me.\" On the victim's hand, there was a burn mark.\nBlaise:\nIndeed... it just happened to match up, y'see. But, what of it?\nEdgeworth:\nAccording to Kay's testimony, the victim had been holding the stuffed animal. And, it just happened to record a characteristic of the victim. Namely, the burn.\nDebeste:\nThat's just a coincidence! I mean... it could happen, right?\nCourtney:\nCourtney:\nI do not think so. It is hard to believe that all of this is simply a coincidence. The voices on the stuffed animal were most likely recorded during the incident.\nEdgeworth:\nOne of these voices must belong to the true culprit. From what we've heard, it must have been the one who was doing most of the talking.\nDebeste:\nBut what's the point? In the end, we still can't tell their gender or identity, you know?\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed, because they had been using voice changers. It can't be helped.\nCourtney:\nIt seems the situation has become quite clear. The conversation Ms. Hart overheard was between the culprit and Ms. Crane.\nLotta:\n...That's what I've been tellin' you from the start.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd from this, we will understand a new fact.\nCourtney:\nPlease enlighten us then. I trust you have no objections, Mr. Chairman.\nBlaise:\n...Do what you want.\nEdgeworth:\nAccording to Ms. Hart's testimony, just before the incident... ...two people came up from the auction hall, using the lift. It must have been the Conductor and one of the auction guests. They probably went there to settle the payment after winning a bid. And then, it was there that the crime was carried out... Since the auction continued after the crime took place... ...we are led to a single truth! (This is the new fact that we have arrived at...!)\nThe culprit is the Conductor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Since the Conductor was the only one who could keep the auction going...\"\nThe culprit is Jill Crane\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe culprit of this case is Jill Crane. It has to be her!\nCourtney:\nProsecutor Edgeworth. This is not the time to be joking around!\nEdgeworth:\nM... Mmph. (As I thought, this wasn't... If I organize all the information I've acquired up until now, I can only arrive at the one answer.)\nCourtney:\nProsecutor Edgeworth. Just what is this new fact you are talking about?\nLeads back to:\n\"(This is the new fact that we have arrived at...!)\"\nThe victim was the Conductor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe victim of this case was the Conductor!\nLotta:\nThat's all fine and dandy, but the auction still went on after the murder, ya know?\nEdgeworth:\n...Nnghhoooh! (It seems that was wrong... If I organize all the information I've acquired up until now, I can only arrive at the one answer.)\nCourtney:\nProsecutor Edgeworth. Just what is this new fact you are talking about?\nLeads back to:\n\"(This is the new fact that we have arrived at...!)\"\nEdgeworth:\nSince the Conductor was the only one who could keep the auction going... ...we can conclude that the deceased victim could not have been the Conductor.\nDebeste:\n...Umm, Justine...\nCourtney:\nPlease be quiet here. Okay?\nEdgeworth:\nIf the Conductor was not the victim, then they must have been the culprit!\nCourtney:\nCourtney:\nPlease wait. That alone is insufficient.\nEdgeworth:\nOf course. Even I do not intend to rely only upon the process of elimination.\nBlaise:\n.........\nEdgeworth:\nCertain traces left at the crime scene led me to believe that the culprit is the Conductor.\nCourtney:\nWell then, please show it to us.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat were the traces left at the crime scene that let me deduce the culprit is the Conductor?\nPresent Meeting Room Blood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The culprit purposely left a large amount of blood in the meeting room.\"\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis is the piece of evidence that shows the culprit is the Conductor.\nDebeste:\nUmm, I don't quite understand.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. Even if you don't understand, everyone else certainly does.\nBlaise:\nI think there are people besides my idiot son who don't understand, y'know.\nEdgeworth:\nNnghhoooh! (It seems that wasn't it... If the culprit was the Conductor, they would have wanted to hide something... I just have to present that!)\nCourtney:\nProsecutor Edgeworth. If you say the culprit is the Conductor... ...could you present evidence to prove that?\nEdgeworth:\nYes. I will show you that piece of evidence right now.\nLeads back to:\n\"What were the traces left at the crime scene that let me deduce the culprit is the Conductor?\"\nEdgeworth:\nThe culprit purposely left a large amount of blood in the meeting room. In doing so, we were led to believe the meeting room had been the scene of the crime. It was a ruse by true culprit. To hide the blood that had fallen from the storeroom!\nCourtney:\nSo we wouldn't find out about the existence of the black market auction... Correct?\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. If the culprit had been unrelated to the auction, there would have been no need to do such a thing. Ergo, the culprit could have only been the Conductor!\nCourtney:\nWell then... Do you have any idea as to who the Conductor might possibly be?\nEdgeworth:\nThe auction hall is at the P.I.C. meeting room, and furthermore, there is a storeroom above it. The Conductor must have been, at the very least, a member of the P.I.C.!\nBlaise:\nSo..... ...in other words, you suspect me, I take it?\nEdgeworth:\nIsn't it natural to suspect you, the one with the most authority in the P.I.C.?\nBlaise:\nBlaise:\n...You are quite capable. I'll give you that much, at least. But y'know, like I said before, you're far too naïve. .....You have nothing, y'know? There's no evidence that proves I am the culprit, y'see. If, by some chance, you do have evidence, then why don't you present it?\nEdgeworth:\n...Urk...! Do I have evidence that Blaise is the culprit...?\nI have it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nNo. There is evidence. Evidence that you are the culprit.\nBlaise:\nOooh. Then, why don't you show it to me? This so-called evidence.\nEdgeworth:\nBlaise Debeste. This piece of evidence proves that you are the culprit!\n\n\n\nPresent anything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Could you take a look at this piece of evidence?\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nCould you take a look at this piece of evidence?\nBlaise:\nEdgeworth. And what about it?\nEdgeworth:\nBlaise Debeste, don't you understand? The meaning of this piece of evidence.\nBlaise:\nWeeell. Y'know, I can't say I do. I mean, it doesn't look like it's related at all.\nEdgeworth:\nGwaaah! (So this wasn't it...! Blaise Debeste has to be the culprit. However, do I have any evidence to prove it?)\nBlaise:\nEdgeworth. There's no evidence to prove that I'm the culprit, y'know?\nLeads back to:\n\"Do I have evidence that Blaise is the culprit...?\"\nI don't have it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"(Blaise himself has suggested that he is the criminal.)\"\nEdgeworth:\n(Blaise himself has suggested that he is the criminal. He's been showing that strange self-confidence for awhile now. He knows that there is not a single piece of evidence left behind to incriminate him.)\nBlaise:\nHa ha ha... If you play with fire, you're gonna get burned, Edgeworth. ...Juuust kidding, I always wanted to say that, y'know. Well then, Courtney...\nLotta:\nI, I-I-I-I-I reckon! I just remembered somethin' too!\nDebeste:\n...Bwuh? You also lost your memories?\nLotta:\nNaw, that ain't it. Somethin' just popped into my head right now!\nCourtney:\nVery well. Please tell us.\nBlaise:\nBlaise:\nCourtney. Could you tell me what you are doing?\nCourtney:\nProsecutor Edgeworth will not give up until we have destroyed every last possibility. I'm destroying every possibility. So that he will never oppose us again.\nBlaise:\n........\nEdgeworth:\n........\nDebeste:\nJustine...! I don't really know what's going on, but well said! Pops, I'm gonna help too! After all, he's the one who's wrong!\nBlaise:\n...Fine then. Let's hear what she has to say.\nCourtney:\nWell then, Ms. Hart. Please proceed.\nLotta:\nS-Sure thing! Just leave it to me!\nEdgeworth:\n...Please make sure you only tell the truth.\nLotta:\nAin't that a matter of course! I'm a bona fide journalist of justice, ya know!\nEdgeworth:\n(.....Somehow I feel uneasy.)\nLotta:\nY'all sayin' the culprit was the Conductor, right? That means, the victim was a customer. Now, here's where it gets a mite strange. Ya see, there were 11 people at the auction. When the auction continued after the incident... ...I went straight on over and snuck a peek down below.\nEdgeworth:\nY-You don't mean.....\nLotta:\nThat's exactly what I mean. All 11 people were still there, present 'n acocunted for.\nEdgeworth:\nWh-aaaaaaaaaaaat!\nCourtney:\nAre you sure about that?\nLotta:\nSure I'm sure. I saw it with my own two eyes.\nDebeste:\nUmm... so it started with 11 people. And there were still 11 people after the murder... Was it a ghost!?\nBlaise:\nY'know, Sebastian. Normally, a prosecutor would call that a contradiction, y'know.\nEdgeworth:\nW-Were there really no changes in the auction at all?\nLotta:\nReally! I'm tellin' ya! The auction just went on like normal. Ah. But... there was one itty bitty thing, though.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat was it?\nLotta:\nYa know those hammers ya always see at an auction? Like the one that lady is usin' over there.\nCourtney:\n...An auction gavel... perhaps?\nLotta:\nYup, that's the one! All of a sudden, I couldn't hear the sound no more. It'd been bangin' away just prior to it.\nEdgeworth:\n(The sound of the gavel? Does that have anything to do with the case?)\nLotta's testimony updated in my Organizer.\nCourtney:\nIf Ms. Hart's testimony is the truth, then this matter has taken a grave turn. If the victim was neither the Conductor nor a customer... ...the very foundation of Prosecutor Edgeworth's reasoning would collapse.\nEdgeworth:\nNngh...!\nDebeste:\nJustice prevails, as they say! I hope you've learned your lesson, Mr. Edgeworth!\nKay:\nMr. Edgeworth... There really is nothing we can do...\nEdgeworth:\n(It's not over yet. Some mysteries still remain. I have to think. If I don't, then Kay will be...!)\nBlaise:\nDid you get the answer you wanted this time? Well then, a deal's a deal...\nCourtney:\nPlease wait, Mr. Chairman. I believe it is still too early to make a judgment. There are still... a few mysteries left in this case. Until we have solved them all, we cannot call this a complete victory.\nEdgeworth:\n......?\nCourtney:\nIsn't that right, Prosecutor Edgeworth? I was expecting you to shout... ...\"Hold it!\" ...like you always do.\nEdgeworth:\nY-Yes. Of course. (Once again... Judge Courtney has come to my aid...)\nBlaise:\nWell then, what is it? What sort of mysteries are left?\nCourtney:\nWell, of course, there's the contradiction in the autopsy report.\nBlaise:\n...That kind of thing...\nOfficer:\nI've brought her in!\nKarin:\nWh-What's wrong? Why were we suddenly called here!? Did someone suddenly get sick!? I-I'll begin preparing a compress, stat... Ouch! \"What'd you call me here for? Did something happen?\"\nCourtney:\nDr. Young, Ms. Jenson, you have my gratitude for taking the trouble to come here. This won't take long. So please relax.\nKarin:\n\"Tell me what in blazes is going on!?\"\nCourtney:\nHa ha ha... Of course. We called you here because something came up.\nEdgeworth:\n(Judge Courtney... Just what are you planning?)\nCourtney:\nBonnie Young! Under the Divine Rule of Law, please answer truthfully. There were no mistakes in your autopsy report, correct?\nKarin:\nGranny would never make a mistake!\nCourtney:\nThat's certainly strange.\nKarin:\nHuh...? What's strange?\nCourtney:\nThis court has found an error in Dr. Young's autopsy report. Dr. Young, please tell the truth. Did you falsify the autopsy report?\nKarin:\nThat's terrible! How can you accuse her of that...!? \"I have no idea what you are talking about. Why would I do such a thing in the first place?\"\nCourtney:\nTo protect the true culprit... Of course.\nKarin:\n\"Watchu talkin' bout!? I would never do such a thing!\"\nCourtney:\nHow strange. In that case, why would there be an error in the autopsy report, I wonder. ...Prosecutor Edgeworth. What do you think?\nEdgeworth:\n........\nCourtney:\nOh? I expected you to press into her statement like you normally do.\nEdgeworth:\n(Why is she taking control of the situation and trying to help me...? I don't know what her goal is... but I must play along.) If the autopsy report you gave to Sebastian had been authentic... ...then the error should not have been there.\nDebeste:\nW-Wait a minute! I didn't do anything!\nEdgeworth:\nThat is what we will figure out from this point on. Firstly... Dr. Young. I'd like to hear your testimony.\nKarin:\nWhy do you want to hear her testimony? It would be pointless!\nEdgeworth:\nI will be the one who decides whether or not it is pointless. Not you.\nKarin:\nThere are patients waiting for us! ...B-But Granny... Ouch! Anyways, we don't have time for this!\nEdgeworth:\nIs there any way I could convince you? This is of the utmost importance.\nKarin:\n...Mr. Miles Edgeworth, Granny says she'll testify. So please, try to finish this quickly. If we don't return soon, there will be people in terrible suffering!\nEdgeworth:\n(And yet, you were lollygagging about on the viewing platform earlier...) I promise you. This won't take long. (Only if she tells me the truth, of course.)\n-- Error in the Autopsy Report --\nKarin:\nThere are no mistakes in Granny's autopsy reports!\n\"I've been working with corpses longer than you've been alive.\"\n\"There's no way I'd make a mistake in writing the autopsy report\" ...Ouch!\n\"I got nothing to gain from falsifying the autopsy report.\"\n...Is what she says. See? There's nothing strange at all!\nBlaise:\nYes, yes! That's right, y'know. There's no way she would falsify it, y'see.\nCourtney:\n...Under the name of the Goddess of Law, do you swear that this testimony is the truth?\nKarin:\nOf course! Granny would never tell a lie...\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nWe were asking Dr. Young. We do not need to hear from a third party.\nKarin:\nI-I'm not a third party! I'm on Granny's side! \"If you raise an objection to my testimony, you'd best prepare yourself... you ex-prosecutor!\"\nEdgeworth:\n(I will definitely expose the contradiction in the autopsy report!)\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: So, you're saying there is no way Dr. Young could have made a mistake? Karin: Of course! Doctors can't afford to make mistakes. This is a world where just one misdiagnosis can end a long career. I know that my Granny, at least, would never... \"If I did something like that, you think they'd still let me run a hospital?\"\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: So in your long career, you've never once made a mistake? Karin: \"A doctor's only as good as the length of their track record.\" Edgeworth: Heh. If we're just talking about a lengthy track record, that former Chief Prosecutor has one too. And yet, his actual abilities don't seem to measure up. I hope that you're not the same as well. Blaise: Ouch... That's a low blow, y'know. But y'know, Edgeworth. I don't make mistakes either, y'see. 'Cuase y'see, before I can make a mistake, those around me will have already made it instead. Y'see, I don't have time for mistakes. It's quite amazing, y'know. It must be karma. Karin: \"You can't compare a Chief Prosecutor with a doctor. You really can't...\"\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: The victim wore this raincoat after suffering a blow to the head. And yet, there was not a single drop of blood on the front of the raincoat. Therefore, it is impossible for the head wound to have been \"postmortem! Karin: Errm. Well, that's... Ouch! \"I don't need you to tell me that! That's what I wrote down from the very beginning!\" Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The autopsy report says, \"the head wound was postmortem.\" That's completely different! Karin: Err... Y-Yeah. \"I relayed to Karin what to put down in the autopsy report. After that, it was none of my beeswax!\" Edgeworth: ...Relayed to Karin? Please elaborate on that. Change this statement to: \"\"I relayed everything to Karin. After that, it was none of my beeswax!\"\"\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: I would like to verify once again what you saw when you examined the body. Karin: Errrm, like we said... Ouch! Oooh... Well, about that... \"She was done in by a thump to her noggin.\" Courtney: Dr. Young, do you know when that happened? Karin: \"Before she died, of course. The wounds on her chest were postmortem. That's what I related to Karin, so that's what should've been written in the report!\" Edgeworth: (That's what you \"relayed\" to her... eh? I'm finally beginning to see the truth.)\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: You may have nothing to gain, but how about your granddaughter? Karin: Me? Th-There isn't anything I could gain! \"If Karin had something to gain, then that girl of yours might have something too. How dare you accuse my little girl, who has never done harm to anybody...\" Yeah! Aren't you ashamed of yourself!? Edgeworth: (She should address those words to Blaise, instead of me.) Karin: \"I swear that the autopsy report wasn't falsified.\"\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Did you notice anything strange when you were performing the autopsy? Karin: I wonder..... Huh? What is it, Granny? \"A strange man came by.\" Edgeworth: Who are you calling strange!? Karin: \"He wore some really strange clothes. He even had a frilly thing around his neck.\" Edgeworth: ........ Karin: \"Even though he was about to get canned... ...he still tried to run a muck during my autopsy... I'm talking about you! You frilly red brute!\" Kay: Hmm, I see. So Mr. Edgeworth is a strange frilly red brute... Edgeworth: ...Kay, please don't only remember odd things about me.\nKay: Umm... It doesn't look like Granny is lying.\nEdgeworth: ...Hmm.

Then, how about we arrest her immediately?\nEdgeworth:\nNnghhoooh! (As I thought, this wasn't it... Who did Ms. Jenson falsify the report for...?

Ms. Jenson is still alive. Wouldn't that mean that she's not a victim?\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. (Who did Ms. Jenson falsify the report for...?

Wouldn't it be possible for someone to move her on their own?\nEdgeworth:\nGwaaargh! (Certainly, that's true. Recall the facts before and after the incident. If the victim also one of the participants... ...that creates a contradiction in her testimony. And we are led to only one answer!)\nBlaise:\nThere's no basis that there had been an accomplice, y'know?\nEdgeworth:\nNo. There is a basis.\nLeads back to:\n\"(The crime could not have been committed without at least two people.

Ya got a problem with my testimony!?\nEdgeworth:\n...Not at all. Rather, it is because I believe your testimony, that's why an accomplice must exist.\nBlaise:\nSo, you still won't admit that your reasoning is wrong?\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nUp until now, we had not even considered the possibility of an accomplice. However, if there had been an accomplice, it changes the entire story completely. If the accomplice took the murdered auction guest's place... ...then the number of people remains eleven!\nBlaise:\nOooh... I see now. So that's what you're thinking. But, y'know, wouldn't that have been quickly discovered?\nEdgeworth:\n...Ms. Jenson and the victim have similar physiques. If she wore the victim's mask, she could have easily taken her place. Ms. Jenson, did you switch places with the victim?\nKarin:\nI, I...! ...I wouldn't...!\nEdgeworth:\nWho was the Conductor...? In other words, tell me who was the true culprit!\nKarin:\nI-I can't! I mean... That would also cause trouble for Granny...! Ah... Ouch! But, Granny...! \"I will accept whatever wrongs you may have done. Just tell me everything.\" G... Gr...... Gr... Gra-Graaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnyyyyyyy!\nEdgeworth:\nAs I thought... it appears you really were the accomplice.\nKay:\nMs. Jenson... Why...?\nCourtney:\nMs. Jenson. ...Would you please tell us?\nKarin:\nYes... It's OK, Granny. I'm fine now. I... switched places with the victim, Ms. Crane.\nEdgeworth:\n...So you admit to being the Conductor's accomplice?\nKarin:\nYes... I helped out the Conductor. I don't really know why, but for some reason... ...the Conductor was expecting to be attacked by Ms. Crane.\nEdgeworth:\n(The Conductor expected an attack from the victim...?)\nKarin:\nThey were so sure it was going to happen, that they came up with a plan to counter it. A way to beat the victim at her own game. And that's when I was called in. I was told to wait in the storeroom before the auction begin.\nLotta:\nWhoa there! You ain't foolin' my eyes! If you were waitin' in the storeroom, I reckon I would've bumped into you! After all, I'd been up in that storeroom the entire auction!\nKarin:\nI'm telling the truth!\nBlaise:\nI wonder about that, y'know. Can we really believe a girl who would falsify a report?\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nHeh... There should've been many places to hide in that storeroom.\nBlaise:\nThen by all means, tell me. Where did our little nurse hide!?\nEdgeworth:\nThe place in the storeroom where Ms. Jenson hid was...!\nPresent Costume Trunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"She hid inside this costume drunk.\"\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nMs. Jenson hid here!\nCourtney:\nProsecutor Edgeworth. Do you think a person could hide in a place like that?\nEdgeworth:\nHeh. I don't.\nCourtney:\nI would like you to answer seriously.\nEdgeworth:\nNnghhoooh! (I knew this wasn't it...)\nKay:\nWhy don't we take a look at the things that were in the storeroom one more time?\nEdgeworth:\nYes. There shouldn't have been that many places where one could hide in.\nBlaise:\nWell, Edgeworth. Where was this little nurse hiding?\nLeads back to:\n\"The place in the storeroom where Ms. Jenson hid was...!\"\nEdgeworth:\nShe hid inside this costume drunk.\nBlaise:\nA costume trunk... eh?\nLotta:\nAh! Now that ya mention it, that box was already there before I snuck in! I figure I would hide in there myself, but it was wrapped up nice 'n' tight with a chain. And it was locked too, so I had to give it up.\nEdgeworth:\nI suspect that when you sneaked into the room, Ms. Jenson was already inside the trunk.\nKarin:\nYes... it would've been bad if one of the guests from the auction had opened the bid. After instructing me to hide inside... ...the Conductor wrapped a chain around the costume trunk. I think they went downstairs using the lift shortly thereafter. It was right before the auction...\nEdgeworth:\nSo then, when the auction began... ...only you and Ms. Hart were in the storeroom.\nKarin:\nYes, that should be right...\nEdgeworth:\nThe auction had been going on as usual, but... ...when a certain participant made the winning bid, the Conductor committed the crime. Ms. Hart must have heard the altercation that occurred then.\nLotta:\nYou betcha! I was tremblin' behind that there statue the whole time though!\nEdgeworth:\nFollowing the altercation, Jill Crane was murdered. After killing Jill Crane, the Conductor carried her body to the costume trunk... ...and Ms. Jenson, who had been hiding in the trunk, was made to take Ms. Crane's place. The victim's body was placed inside the costume trunk. The Conductor then took Ms. Jenson, who had been made to look like Jill Crane... ...and returned to the auction hall as if nothing had happened. Was this roughly what happened in the storeroom during the incident?\nKarin:\nYes... That's right.\nLotta:\nPullin' the old switcheroo with one of the auction guests... Ain't that impossible? That gal and the murder victim are two completely different people, ya know. Don't ya reckon one of the other participants would've noticed and caused a ruckus?\nEdgeworth:\nNo, not at all. The reason they didn't notice the switch was because...\nShe stole the victim's clothes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"From what I can tell, Ms. Jenson and the victim appear to have a similar physique.\"\nShe used the victim's name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...Ms. Jenson addressed herself by the victim's name.\nLotta:\nAin't this an auction where y'all hide yer faces with a mark? I reckon they wouldn't give out their names!\nEdgeworth:\nNnghhoooh! (She's completely right... Her face was hidden by a mask. What else would have been necessary to change into Ms. Crane? That's the only thing I have to consider. I should already know the answer!)\nLotta:\nHey, City Boy. Tell it to me straight. Why ain't nobody find out that they switched places?\nLeads back to:\n\"The reason they didn't notice the switch was because...\"\nShe acted like the victim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n...most likely Ms. Jenson acted like the victim. Since her face was hidden, that's probably why no one noticed.\nLotta:\nYa dummy! Even if her face was hidden, they still wore different clothes!\nEdgeworth:\nArgh! (It seems that was wrong... Her face was hidden by a mask. What else would have been necessary to change into Ms. Crane? That's the only thing I have to consider. I should already know the answer!)\nLotta:\nHey, City Boy. Tell it to me straight. Why ain't nobody find out that they switched places?\nLeads back to:\n\"The reason they didn't notice the switch was because...\"\nEdgeworth:\nFrom what I can tell, Ms. Jenson and the victim appear to have a similar physique. Furthermore, there was a rule requiring a mask to be worn during the auction. If their clothes were the same, I doubt anyone would've noticed she was a different person.\nKarin:\n...Yes. I blended right in. I borrowed Ms. Crane's clothes and... Ouch! \"You mustn't embarrass the dead like that!\" I know... I also thought it was pretty heartless to leave her exposed like that... So when the Conductor wasn't looking, I covered her up in the raincoat that was up for auction.\nEdgeworth:\n(So she was the one who put the red raincoat on the victim...) And then, the auction resumed as if nothing had happened.\nLotta:\nI reckon I took the picture of her in the red raincoat after that. That'd make all the facts line up.\nLotta:\nAfter I took the photo, I went over to the lift to sneak a peek down below. I witnessed the 11 participants, and then I high-tailed it back behind the statue.\nEdgeworth:\nDon't tell me... You were hiding there the entire time until we found you?\nLotta:\nNah, that's... How should I put it...\nEdgeworth:\n...? What is it? Did something happen?\nLotta:\nI didn't mention it before, but after that I might've dozed off a while. To be more precise... I fainted? Well, somethin' like that.\nEdgeworth:\nS-So something did happen!\nLotta:\nI-It ain't no big deal! Kinda embarrassin' to say, though. There was this huge *THUMP* sound all of a sudden... I was a liiiittle surprised by that. It was right after I had just witnessed a murder, so I was shakin' in my foots... My hear sorta tightened up, and I was off to la-la land... When I woke up, it was already the next day, 'round the time y'all came by the storeroom.\nEdgeworth:\nI see. So there was a large sound... Ms. Hart, I take it you do not know what transpired in the storeroom beyond this point?\nLotta:\nI-I guess. But after the auction, all the masks were properly returned... So I reckon the participants had exited through the storeroom, just like I done said!\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... Ms. Jenson, what were your actions after the auction resumed?\nKarin:\nI took the victim's place and participated in the auction. The Conductor instructed me to win the the bid for the costume trunk... ...because the body was inside it. It would have been bad if another auction guest won the bid for it...\nEdgeworth:\nYou didn't realize the box was empty?\nKarin:\nNo. We only found out when I came up to the storeroom to pay the bill. The Conductor was with me and told me to go search for her immediately. And then... I found another girl collapsed in front of the ladder!\nEdgeworth:\nKay...\nKarin:\nYes. She probably fell down from the rood and lost consciousness.\nLotta:\nMaybe the victim left the hatch open when she went up to the rooftop.\nEdgeworth:\nI understand now. Kay was surprised at seeing the collapsed victim and did not notice the open hatch. She must have missed her footing and fell down into the storeroom. Ms. Hart, I have determined the sound that made you faint. It was likely the sound of Kay falling onto the storeroom floor.\nLotta:\nThat mighta been it. Though I reckon it'd be kinda pathetic to faint over something like that.\nEdgeworth:\nWhen Ms. Jenson found the unconscious Kay... ...Ms. Hart was also unconscious behind the statue. The situation is becoming clearer to me. Ms. Jenson, please continue your story.\nKarin:\nAfter I found Kay and the victim, I... put them both in the trunk. If the customers at the auction found out, there would've been a huge commotion.\nEdgeworth:\nWas this an order from the Conductor as well?\nKarin:\nYes, it was... But, since I secretly decided to put the raincoat on Ms. Crane... ...I had to dispose of the raincoat without the Conductor noticing.\nEdgeworth:\nHeh... So the Conductor didn't anticipate the raincoat becoming another piece of evidence.\nKarin:\nAnd, finally... ...we dressed Ms. Crane in a spare Conductor's outfit.\nEdgeworth:\nI see. In doing so, you made the victim appear as if she was the Conductor.\nKarin:\nIn the end, the auction ended without anyone noticing anything.\nEdgeworth:\nHmm... Ms. Jenson. Your crimes have become clear. If you know anything else, please hold nothing back.\nKarin:\nI want to help you more... but that is all I know... Umm, if I had to say, there is just one thing that bothers me. When I took Ms. Crane's place, I borrowed her clothes... ...but there was no way for me to borrow her hair... Ouch! \"What kinda coroner's assistant goes around stealin' a corpse's hair?\"\nEdgeworth:\n(I would think that robbing the deceased of their clothes would be questionable enough...)\nKarin:\nBoth the color and the length of our hair is different, so I was worried about how to disguise it. However, the Conductor even had a wig prepared for me. In fact... he had two of them. Inside the costume trunk, there was both a straight wig and a wavy wig.\nEdgeworth:\nTwo wigs...? Why were there two?\nKarin:\nWho knows...? Maybe it was a precaution, in case the victim had changed her hairstyle...? I ended up using the straight wig to match Ms. Crane's hair.\nEdgeworth:\n(So that means the wavy wig was left unused...)\nKarin's Testimony jotted down in my Organizer.\nEdgeworth:\n...Is that really all you know?\nKarin:\nYes... Yup, that's really all I know.\nEdgeworth:\nSo that means you don't know who the Conductor is?\nKarin:\n...I'm sorry. I only knew that person as the auction conductor... I never saw that person without a mask on. The Conductor seemed to be on guard... towards everybody.\nEdgeworth:\n...Nngh! (At this rate...!)\nBlaise:\nAh ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Edgeworth, is that all you've got? Even if that little nurse is an accomplice, it changes absolutely nothing, y'know? In the end, the true culprit is still Kay Faraday. All you did was add another criminal, y'know. The rule of law cannot be overturned. At least, not for your sake.\nEdgeworth:\n(Is this as far as I go? Am I unable... to save Kay...?)\n???:\nEdgeworth:\nFranziska...! Why are you here!?\nFranziska:\nDidn't I tell you, Miles Edgeworth? Wherever there is a case, I will follow.\nCourtney:\nProsecutor von Karma... Your hard work is most appreciated.\nFranziska:\nHowever... Don't get the wrong idea. I only came here to find out the truth behind what happened to Kay Faraday. ...I don't plan on forgiving you for abandoning the prosecutor's path!\nEdgeworth:\n...I understand.\nFranziska:\n.....You should thank your \"former\" subordinate. He gave me some valuable information which may save Kay Faraday.\nEdgeworth:\n! (Detective Gumshoe did...)\nFranziska:\nListen well, Miles Edgeworth! This will be the final piece of evidence... Jill Crane..... suffered the wound on her head first!\nCourtney:\n........\nKay:\n............\nFranziska:\nWell, someone say something!\nEdgeworth:\nHm. U-Umm... Well, I hate to say it, but... ...we already proved that.\nFranziska:\n......Already, proved?\nEdgeworth:\nYes. Well, just a few minutes ag- AARRGH!\nFranziska:\nYou should've told me sooner!\nEdgeworth:\n(You're the one who barged in here and started talking!)\nFranziska:\nWell, then... does that mean you've found out what the murder weapon was already?\nEdgeworth:\nNo, not yet.\nFranziska:\nHmph... Is that so? In that case, listen well. The victim was struck on the head with a blunt cylindrical object. The wound on her chest was suffered postmortem.\nEdgeworth:\n(A cylindrical murder weapon...!)\nBlaise:\nBlaise:\nY'know, this report of yours, I trust it's accurate, of course?\nFranziska:\nThese were the results of two independent autopsies, carried out by two respected doctors.\nBlaise:\nBlaise:\nThat's reassuring... but, it's too bad. You have no right to investigate this ca-\nFranziska:\nFranziska:\nInterpol is after the black market auctions. And I'm the prosecutor in charge of the investigation. The victim particpated in the auction. Therefore, it is only natural for me to investigate. Especially now that she's been murdered.\nBlaise:\n.....I see, I see. Clever girl, little Von Karma.\nCourtney:\nThen it has been settled. The victim died from blunt force trauma to the head.\nAutopsy Report updated in my Organizer.\nExamine evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProngs on Candelabra\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis candelabra inflicted the wounds on the victim's chest. Since we have proven that the cause of death was the wound she suffered on her head... ...this was probably used to disguise the cause of death.\nFranziska:\nUnfortunately... the murder weapon has yet to be found.\nEdgeworth:\nHeh... Just knowing the shape of the murder weapon, gives me an idea as you what it might be.\nDebeste:\nHey, hey! In my investigation, we didn't find any other murder weapons, you know?\nEdgeworth:\nIf you consider the Conductor's possessions and the crime scene, the answer should be clear. The blunt cylindrical object used in the auction hall was...\nJudge Courtney's gavel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nJudge Courtney. The murder weapon is your gavel!\nCourtney:\nProsecutor Edgeworth. I'm not sure what you're trying to say... ...but if you're suspecting me, then why don't you examine it up close and personal!\nEdgeworth:\nTh... That's won't be necessary. (As I thought, that was wrong. What am I doubting myself for? If I just think about the Conductor's possessions, the answer is clear.)\nDebeste:\nMr. Edgeworth! Just what was the murder weapon in this case?\nLeads back to:\n\"The blunt cylindrical object used in the auction hall was...\"\nAn auction gavel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"It was something the Conductor had in their hand during the auction...\"\nA judge's gavel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nBesides a judge's gavel, I can't think of anything else.\nBlaise:\nEdgeworth, there's never a dull moment with you, y'know. A judge's gavel, y'say? Sebastian, what do you think?\nDebeste:\nUmm... I don't think so.\nEdgeworth:\nArgh! (I was shot down by the Debestes! What am I doubting myself for? If I just think about the Conductor's possessions, the answer is clear.)\nDebeste:\nMr. Edgeworth! Just what was the murder weapon in this case?\nLeads back to:\n\"The blunt cylindrical object used in the auction hall was...\"\nEdgeworth:\nIt was something the Conductor had in their hand during the auction... Namely, an auction gavel.\nDebeste:\nAn auction gavel? We didn't find anything like that!\nCourtney:\nIf the culprit is the Conductor, it is possible that the gavel may be murder weapon. However... that alone is not reason enough, wouldn't you agree?\nEdgeworth:\nOf course, I have proof to back it up! This piece of evidence proves that the murder weapon is the auction gavel...\nPresent Lotta's Testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nLeads to:\n\"She hid inside this costume drunk.\"\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nTake a look at this piece of evidence. This proves the murder weapon is the auction gavel!\nFranziska:\nMiles Edgeworth. I don't know what you're trying to say... ...but if you don't want to fall prey to my whip, then stop spouting that nonsense!\nEdgeworth:\nNnghhoooh! (But you already hit me, regardless! Wasn't there something different after the gavel had been used as the murder weapon? I should take another look at the evidence.)\nCourtney:\nWell, Prosecutor Edgeworth? Can you show us evidence that the auction gavel is the murder weapon?\nEdgeworth:\nHeh. I can and I will.\nLeads back to:\n\"The place in the storeroom where Ms. Jenson hid was...!\"\nEdgeworth:\nAccording to Ms. Hart's testimony, after the victim had been murdered... ...it seems she suddenly stopped hearing the sound of the gavel during the auction. However, she had been able to hear it up until then. Why was that... you ask? It was because it had been used as the murder weapon and was covered in the victim's blood... ...it became necessary to dispose of it. Isn't that right? Blaise Debeste!\nBlaise:\n.........\nFranziska:\n...I'll have a search for the murder weapon performed immediately.\nBlaise:\nAh ha ha ha ha! Well... Good luck with that, y'know. You've gotta work as hard as you can while you're young, y'see.\nEdgeworth:\n(He's completely confident that we won't find it...!)\nCourtney:\nWell then, while the search for the murder weapon continues... I hereby call for a brief recess.\nTo be continued.\nApril 6, 9:18 AMGrand TowerP.I.C. Meeting Room\nCourtney:\nOrder in the court. Prosecutor von Karma. Your report, please.\nFranziska:\n......I have a bad news. We've searched every inch of the Grand Tower, but... ...the auction gavel was nowhere to be found.\nEdgeworth:\nKh...!\nCourtney:\n...That is most unfortunate. It seems... I am left with no choice, but to pronounce a verdict.\nBlaise:\nWell... it sure seems that way, y'know. Normally, you wouldn't commit a blunder like leaving behind the murder weapon, y'know. The best criminals would never do something like that, y'see.\nEdgeworth:\n(Urk..... I don't have enough information! Is this as far as I can go...!?)\nBlaise:\nYes, yes. It's a shame, y'know. But it can't be helped, y'see. This takes me back, y'know. All those defendants who came to me, asking for a plea bargain. They trusted me, y'know. Told me every one of their dirty little secrets, y'see. And when it came time for the trial, I'd get them sentenced to life in prison... Th-They... were all completely dumbstruck, y'know. Each and every one of them... Ha ha ha...! Oh, how I wish you all could have seen it, y'know... th-the stupid look on their faces!\nCourtney:\nI shall hereby announce my verdict. Please humbly accept the words of the Law.\nEdgeworth:\n(There's... nothing more I can do. With this, both Kay and I are...)\nKay:\n........\nFranziska:\nIf only we had some evidence...!\nCourtney:\nI never thought that I would be passing judgment on you like this.\nEdgeworth:\n(Is this the end...?)\nCourtney:\nThe defendant... Blaise Debeste! I hereby indict you!\nFranziska:\nWhat...\nEdgeworth:\nWHAAAAAAAAAT!?\nBlaise:\n..........Oh? What's gotten into you all of a sudden?\nCourtney:\nI have here, documents regarding a certain case. The IS-7 Incident... A case that happened 18 years ago.\nEdgeworth:\nDocuments... you say? Why would you suddenly...? Wait... you don't mean...! On the day of the crime, the record of your keycard being used was because...!\nCourtney:\nI came to this room to fetch these documents, of course. Although... when I entered the meeting room... ...it seems it was before the black market auction had begun. At first I told you that I came to gather documents about you, Prosecutor Edgeworth... At that time, I simply could not tell you the truth.\nIS-7 Incident Documents jotted down in my Organizer.\nDebeste:\nWhat are you doing, Justine!? Why are you indicting Pops!? Without any basis... th-this is slander!\nCourtney:\nThat was a wonderful remark, Sebastian!\nDebeste:\n...Huh? R-Really?\nCourtney:\nOf course there is a basis. During the case 18 years ago... ...Prosecutor Manfred von Karma \"fabricated\" information regarding the body.\nEdgeworth:\n(That was because the body of the sculptor, Isaac Dover, had been stolen...)\nFranziska:\nPapa \"fabricated\" information about a body? What do you mean...!?\nCourtney:\nDetective Lacer, who handled the initial investigation, reported that the body had gone missing. However, in order to deceive Prosecutor von Karma... ...there is a person who purposely did not report to him that the body had disappeared!\nFranziska:\nWhat...!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat did you say...!?\nCourtney:\nThat person would not forgive those who defied him, nor would he allow others to hold power. He would use any means necessary, in order to bend others to his will. And then... also 18 years ago... ...Director Young, was ordered by a certain individual to write a fake autopsy report.\nEdgeworth:\nDr. Young was the one who wrote the autopsy report for the IS-7 Incident!?\nKarin:\nP-Please wait! Granny didn't do anything wrong! She was ordered by that person... She had no choice but to obey!\nEdgeworth:\nThat person...?\nCourtney:\nThat person... was the Chief Prosecutor at the time.\nEdgeworth:\nThe Chief Prosecutor... 18 years ago... Y-You don't mean...!\nFranziska:\nThe Chief Prosecutor... who gave Papa his first penalty...\nCourtney:\nIt was none other than you! Blaise Debeste!\nBlaise:\n............\nDebeste:\nDebeste:\nWh... What are you saying!? Pops would never do something like that!\nCourtney:\nCourtney:\nSebastian. We do not need your opinion right now. ...Blaise Debeste. Do you have a rebuttal?\nBlaise:\nFabricating stuff about the body, Von Karma did all that on his own, y'know. Falsifying the autopsy report? Young. You would actually do something like that? Maaan... Y-You really did some terrible things behind my back, y'know...?\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nSeeing as how all the parties concerned are here today, we should ask them directly.\nKarin:\nP-Please wait! Granny is... Ouch! Granny... I'm sorry! I... knew. That's why I...! Yup... Because if I didn't... He said he would expose you! If I didn't assist in the crime, Granny would be prosecuted! That's what that man... the Conductor... told me!\nBlaise:\n...............\nEdgeworth:\nSo Ms. Jenson... was being threatened. Was the Conductor who threatened you... Blaise Debeste?\nKarin:\nTh-That... I don't know. The person who threatened me was the auction conductor. They do have similar physiques, but I never saw the person's face...\nEdgeworth:\nAny trivial thing is fine! Give us a characteristic that could be a clue...!\nKarin:\n......Th-That's right! The Conductor's mask, it exposed just a tiny part of his face. There was a tattoo there. I'm sure of it!\nConductor's Clothes data updated in my Organizer.\nEdgeworth:\nA tattoo... you say?\nBlaise:\nBlaise:\nI really have no idea what you're talking about, y'know. As you can see, there are clearly no tattoos on my face, y'see. So that person doesn't match me at all, y'know. The person who threatened her, this so-called Conductor... I wonder who it is, y'know. Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!\nCourtney:\nYou have incurred the wrath of the Goddess of Law. I suggest you watch what you say.\nEdgeworth:\n(Hasn't he incurred your own wrath, rather than the wrath of the Goddess...?)\nCourtney:\nJill Crane had been pursuing you, just as I have. ...And I will not let her death be in vain.\nBlaise:\nCrane was... y'know. You say she was pursuing me? My, my. I didn't really know her that well, y'know. I don't mind girls chasing after me, y'know. But I don't recall her ever falling for me, y'see.\nCourtney:\n...You didn't know the victim well? That is a testimony we haven't heard up until now. Before the eyes of the Goddess of Law, you shall give us an official testimony!\nBlaise:\n...I see, I see. Everyone is bullying me. I-If you're gonna go that far... That's fine, y'see... I'll just have to make you disappear.......... Every last one of you.\nCourtney:\n...Prosecutor Edgeworth, I shall cooperate with you as well.\nEdgeworth:\n!\nCourtney:\nIf we let this opportunity slip by, I doubt we will ever get him to stand in court again. Please. do not let this chance go to waste...\nEdgeworth:\nYes..... I promise I will live up to your expectations.\nCourtney:\nNow then, Blaise Debeste, you shall testify regarding the victim!\n-- Regarding Jill Crane --\nBlaise:\nThe victim, Jill Crane, was a member of the Prosecutorial Investigation Committee, y'see.\nPersonally, I didn't really know her that well, y'know.\nEither way, it's not like I had a motive to murder her, y'know.\nI have no idea why she was pursuing me, y'see.\nEdgeworth:\n...You intend to deny your guilt until the bitter end, don't you?\nDebeste:\nOf course he does! There's no way Pops could be the criminal! I mean, he's my pops, you know! He's the very best, like no one ever was!\nBlaise:\nYes, yes, Sebastian. If you're gonna stick up for me, be sure to have a clear basis, y'know.\nDebeste:\nA-Alright... I got it! I'll clear you of these false accusations, Pops. I believe in you, Pops! We won't lose to someone like Mr. Edgeworth!\nBlaise:\nYes, yes. ...You really are pure, y'know?\nKay:\nThat person... he really loves his father, doesn't he...?\nFranziska:\nHowever... one must be able to accept the mistakes of their father... ...no matter how much they may look up to him...\nCourtney:\n...Each person must atone for their crimes, no matter who they are.\nEdgeworth:\n..... (This is going to be hard for Sebastian, but... ...I simply cannot overlook his father's crimes!)\n\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: If she was a member of the P.I.C, then you should have been familiar with her. Blaise: Well... I knew her face, but that's about it, y'know. It's not like we met each other on a regular basis, y'see...\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: So you're saying you weren't very familiar with the victim? Blaise: That's right. I didn't even know about the burn mark on Crane's hand, y'see. Edgeworth: You didn't know about the burn mark...? Blaise: W-Well, y'see... Even if I had gotten close to her, she would have disappeared soon... It's a pain to remember someone, y'know, wh-when they're must gonna disappear, y'see. Edgeworth: (In other words, anyone who defies him disappears...) I would like you to add your statement about the victim's burn to your testimony. Add statement: \"I only just learned that she had a burn mark on her hand, y'see.\"\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: So you're saying that you didn't know about the victim's burn... Is that really the truth? Blaise: You really are persistent, y'know. Do you really think I would pay attention to every little wound on a woman's hand? Edgeworth: I would think the burn mark on the victim's hand would be hard to miss... Courtney: Now that you mention it... Jill Crane would regularly wear gloves. I, too, did not know about the burn until the incident occurred. Edgeworth: (Jill Crane regularly wore gloves...?) Blaise: I thought so. She was probably trying to hide the burn mark, y'see? I understand how sensitive a woman can be about these things, y'know. Edgeworth: ...I would like you to add your so-called sensitive understanding of a woman to your testimony. Add statement: \"Maybe she was always wearing gloves in order to hide the burn mark, y'know.\"\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: So you were aware that she always wore gloves? Blaise: Well aware. Those gloves were practically her trademark, y'see. But I guess they weren't just a fashion statement. She wanted to hide her burn mark, y'know. I wonder if that girl over there is also hiding something under her bandages? Kay: Huh...? I'm... not hiding anything... Blaise: I think you are, y'know. You're hiding the face of a criminal! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Those words... should be directed at someone like you. I shall expose, here and now... the face of a true criminal! Blaise: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! How amusing. ...Go ahead and try it, if you think you can. Edgeworth: (So, Jill Crane regularly wore gloves... That's interesting... I should look over the evidence one more time.)\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: Was there ever any trouble between you two over work? Blaise: Ah ha ha! Unlikely, y'know. I'm kind of important, y'see. I've gotten reports saying that she was exceedingly capable. But, y'know, our social status was completely different, y'see? So we didn't talk much, y'know. Edgeworth: That may be true, but it doesn't prove that you didn't kill her. Blaise: That's rather prejudiced, y'know. I mean, look at you. You're taking the side of a criminal. Courtney: It seems Ms. Crane was the one who had an interest in you, Mr. Chairman. Blaise: Y'know, that really is a mystery. I haven't the faintest idea, y'see. So that's that. Since I had no motive, your reasoning doesn't hold, y'know?\nEdgeworth: Edgeworth: So you have no clue why the victim had been pursuing you? Blaise: Nope. Not in the slightest, y'know... Debeste: It's because Pops is such a handsome man! Blaise: It's true, y'know. Women appear before me and then disappear, disappear and then reappear... Debeste: Heh heh. You guys could never reach my Pop's level of awesomeness. Courtney: It would certainly be impossible for a normal person... ...having people appear and then \"physically\" disappear on a daily basis. Blaise: ......Well, then. Maybe Courtney's going to disappear too? Edgeworth: Hmph... Before that happens, I'll see to it your way of life disappears today. Blaise: I see, I see... Then I should finish it before the day's over. Keh heh heh heh heh.\nEdgeworth: (I will have to organize my information about the victim...)\nFranziska: ...If there's anything you don't understand, you should look over the evidence again. Perhaps you'll find a new fact this time around.\nEdgeworth: ! Franziska... You're willing to help me?\nFranziska: I told you, I'm doing this for Kay Faraday... not you.\nEdgeworth: (...Franziska seems to be worrying about Kay in her own way.)",

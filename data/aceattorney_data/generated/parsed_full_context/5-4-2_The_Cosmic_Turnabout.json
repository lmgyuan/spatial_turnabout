That incident perfectly symbolized the state of the legal world in this dark age of the law. Mr. Wright brought it to a resolution... of sorts. Ted Tonate was discovered to be the one responsible for the bombing. ............If only it were that simple. Somehow, I can't help but think... ...that there's a darker influence at work -- one that's lurking in the shadows, waiting... That's why I want to review the trial that was taking place when the bombing occurred. After all, I've got more than a few personal stakes in it...\nEpisode 4The Cosmic Turnabout\nAnime cutscene\nOperator:\nOne hour remaining until launch. Please begin your final equipment check.\nAstronaut:\nCheck complete! Everything's A-OK. We're ready here whenever you are!\nOperator:\nCome in HAT-2! Come in! Do you copy?!\nDecember 16, 9:12 AMDistrict Court - Defendant Lobby No. 5\nApollo:\n(Time for another trial to begin... But this one is different.) ............\n???:\nUmm.. Sorry to bother you, but...\nWoods:\nAre you all right, Apollo?\nApollo:\n(Ack! Was I making a scary face just now?!) Oh, hi, Juniper! Yes, I'm fine! I was just doing my Chords of Steel exercises. Now I'm all ready to go!\nWoods:\nYes, knowing you, I'm sure you will be just fine! Oh! I brought you a present from my garden.\nApollo:\nIs this... a lotus root?\nWoods:\nThat's right. My grandma says lotus root is good for your eyes. She says that if you look through the holes, it can help you see into the future! It's for good luck! Maybe later, you can cook it and--\nApollo:\nThanks for this! I'm gonna have some right now!\nWoods:\nOh, my!\nApollo:\n............Mmm. *crunch* Kinda tough, though...\nWoods:\nHee hee! You can't eat it raw! But... thank you for the enthusiastic try.\nApollo:\n(Oops! If she didn't think me weird before, she will now! I've gotta calm down!)\nAthena:\nApollo! I'm sorry I'm late!\nWoods:\nHi, Thena!\nAthena:\nJunie! I didn't know you were coming today. Did you come to cheer Apollo on? Oh, I get it. You sly little thing, you! Ha ha ha!\nWoods:\nTh-Thena, stop!\nApollo:\nQuit kidding around, Athena. The trial's about to start any second. Is everything all set?\nAthena:\nOh, Apollo, Apollo... When will you ever figure it out?\nApollo:\nFigure out what?\n???:\n............Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh...\nApollo:\n(Wow. That was the longest sigh I've ever heard.)\n???:\nHaaaaangh... This is it. It's all over for me... They're gonna find me guilty.\nApollo:\n(This is our client, one Mr. Solomon \"Sol\" Starbuck. He's a very famous astronaut, who happens to be an acquaintance of mine. You wouldn't know it right now, but he's usually a very upbeat and driven person. The scene of the crime this time happened to be the Cosmos Space Center. Back in high school, my best friend and I went there almost a little too much... ...but that's where we met Mr. Starbuck. We'd ask about space travel and he'd launch into story after story with so much passion... Back in those days, the man was one hundred percent my hero.)\nStarbuck:\nAre... you sure you're okay with being my lawyer, Apollo...?\nApollo:\nOf course I'm sure. I know you, Mr. Starbuck. I know you're not the type to commit murder.\nStarbuck:\nThanks, but......... Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... I was supposed to be in space right about now... Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh...\nApollo:\n(He's so depressed, it almost seems like an act. The launch getting called off must've been a huge shock.)\nStarbuck:\nI'll probably never get the chance to go into space again.\nApollo:\nDon't say that! Don't stop believing! Besides, you just have to go into space again!\nStarbuck:\nYeah... I don't think I could face Clay in the afterlife if I just rotted away in a cell.\nAthena:\nClay Terran... I can't believe he was murdered. I mean, he was such a promising astronaut under your command...\nStarbuck:\nYeah... He was a good guy -- always there to pick me up when I was down. No one loved life as much as him, that's for sure. He was always so full of energy, telling me, \"You're fine, Mr. Starbuck!\"... ...Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... How could something like this happen to a guy like him, huh?\nApollo:\n(I've never seen Mr. Starbuck so down...)\nStarbuck:\n...Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... Clay's gone, and I'm going to prison... I wish I could burn up like a shooting star right now.\nApollo:\n...Mr. Starbuck! You'll be fine!\nStarbuck:\nAh! Wh-What is it?! What's with the yelling?!\nApollo:\nI'll get to the bottom of this today! You'll see! And in exchange, I want you to go back into space for you and Clay! Promise?!\nStarbuck:\n...Does that mean you have lots of evidence to prove my innocence?\nApollo:\nOh! Umm... Well... About that... We... didn't get to investigate the area as much as I'd have liked, thanks to the police.\nStarbuck:\n............I'm done for. I'm a goner. Everybody thinks I did it. Thought I was gonna soar like a comet, but I'm just gonna crash like a meteorite.\nApollo:\nNo, don't say that, Mr. Starbuck!\nAthena:\nDon't count yourself out yet!\nApollo:\nI know it's hard to lose a teammate, but you've got to keep going.\nAthena:\n............And what about you, Apollo?\nApollo:\nWhat about me?\nAthena:\nI was just thinking, wasn't Clay your best friend?\nApollo:\n.........We need to focus on the trial right now. Are you all ready to go?\nAthena:\nApollo...\nBailiff:\nThe trial is about to begin. If the defense would please proceed into the courtroom!\nAthena:\nO-Okay! Here we go!\nApollo:\n(This is it. This is one trial I can't afford to lose! For Clay's sake and our client's, I WILL find Clay's killer!)\nDecember 16, 9:55 AMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 4\nDay 1Court Is Now In SessionAll Rise\nJudge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Solomon Starbuck.\nApollo:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.\nJudge:\n............Excuse me, Mr. Justice?\nApollo:\nYes, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nWhat happened to your eye?\nApollo:\n...I'm fine! The defense is ready, Your Honor!\nJudge:\n............Are you sure? I don't--\nApollo:\nI'm fine, Your Honor! The defense is ready!\nAthena:\nI'm sorry, Your Honor. He's been like this since yesterday. He keeps insisting it's just a sty.\nJudge:\nHmm... I suppose it's something he doesn't want to discuss. Maybe he's entering a touchy age...\nApollo:\n............\nJudge:\nVery well. And the prosecution...?\nBlackquill:\n............\nJudge:\nThe prosecution appears to be ready as well.\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\n............ ............... ...Not yet. I'm... not quite ready yet.\nJudge:\nHmm?\nBlackquill:\nNgh... Graaaaaaagh!\nJudge:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!\nBlackquill:\nThe prosecution... is now ready.\nAthena:\nWell, it didn't take him long this time.\nApollo:\n............ (What's up with Blackquill?)\nJudge:\nN-N-Now, then. I-I-I shall give the opening statement...\nBlackquill:\nJudge:\n............\nBlackquill:\nI'll do it.\nJudge:\nYou will? Wh-What an unexpected surprise!\nBlackquill:\nThis time, I can't leave it to anyone else.\nJudge:\nI-I see... Hmm... Something is off with the two of you today. You both seem different somehow.\nAthena:\n............\nJudge:\nVery well, Prosecutor Blackquill. Your opening statement, if you would.\nBlackquill:\nIt was just yesterday. The crimes in question occurred at the Cosmos Space Center.\nJudge:\nAh, that famous federal research facility of all things related to astrology, right?\nBlackquill:\nAstronomy. It's astronomy. Anyway, a rocket was set to launch from there... ...but at 9:28 AM, before they could even move the rocket to the launch site... ...two explosive devices were detonated, and the launch was canceled.\nJudge:\nMy word! Two bombs? How dreadful...\nBlackquill:\nThe defendant in today's trial is charged with both the bombing and with murder... One Mr. Solomon Starbuck. For whatever inane reason, he detonated a bomb on the rocket he himself would be in.\nJudge:\nSolomon Starbuck? I recognize that name. Isn't he that famous astronaut?!\nBlackquill:\nCorrect, Your Baldness. Mr. Starbuck was the pilot of the HAT-1 rocket seven years ago. As you may recall, despite some interstellar trouble, his mission was a success. Some say it was a miracle he returned alive. I suppose you could say he's a living legend.\nJudge:\nOh, I remember now. He's become something of an international celebrity, right? They even turned that incident into a movie and everything! We've got a real space pioneer in court today!\nBlackquill:\nHmph. But even heroes tumble from their lofty heights. Returning to the subject at hand...\nJudge:\nAh, yes. The victim was one Mr. Clay Terran, a subordinate of the defendant.\nBlackquill:\nIndeed. A loyal disciple brutally stabbed to death by his mentor.\nJudge:\nStabbed to death, you say? You mean his death wasn't a result of the bombing?\nBlackquill:\nCorrect. Despite his lofty dreams, the victim was seen as an interloper by the defendant. And so, he was sent not into space, but to the universe which we mortals can not see.\nApollo:\n(Clay...)\nJudge:\nI think I've heard enough. The case seems pretty clear-cut at this point. However, there is one thing I'm curious about. That metal box next to the witness stand... What purpose does it serve, exactly?\nBlackquill:\nSince you asked so nicely... It's your coffin.\nJudge:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! Have mercy on meeeeeeeeeeee!\nBlackquill:\n............I jest. It's evidence. Due to its immense size, we've little choice but to lay it where it rests now. We shall get to the contents of the box in due time.\nJudge:\nPhew... I feel like I just lost fifty years off of my life.\nAthena:\n...Does he even HAVE fifty years left?\nApollo:\nInner monologue, Athena! Inner monologue!\nBlackquill:\nEnough jabbering.\nFulbright:\nBobby Fulbright's the name! In justice we trust!\nJudge:\nAh, Detective Fulbright! Very well, them. Please explain the details of this incident to the court, if you would.\nFulbright:\nOn it! First, take a look at this pamphlet from the Cosmos Space Center! In it, you'll find a diagram outlining the overall layout of the Space Center. Ah, here we are. For a more detailed look at what's on the left side of this building... ...take a look at this cross-section that we the police have created. See the launch pad and the main building?\nJudge:\nThe launch pad is the square building, and the rounded structure is the main building, right?\nFulbright:\nYou got it. The incidents took place in Launch Pad 1 and in the main building's Lounge. I'll be using this diagram during my testimony -- it'll make it easier to understand!\nSpace Center Diagram added to the Court Record.\nWitness Testimony\n-- Details of the Case --\nFulbright:\nJust before the rocket was set to launch, two bombs went off. BOOM! BOOM!\nOne on the second floor of the Space Center's main building and one in Launch Pad 1.\nThankfully, only the two astronauts were in Launch Pad 1 at the time.\nThe two of them managed to make it back as far as the boarding lounge...\n...but after the escape, one of the two was found stabbed to death!\nJudge:\nHmm... A murder on top of a bombing...? Detective, the victim was already dead by the time you arrived at the lounge, correct?\nFulbright:\nYup. Thinking he'd sabotage the bombing, the defendant killed him right there in the rocket. (Changed from [Yup. Thinking he'd sabotage the bombing, the defendant attacked and killed the victim.] in the original release) Just look at this tragic photo!\nJudge:\nOh, my! I-Is that a knife in the victim's chest?!\nFulbright:\nYes, Your Honor, it's the knife that cruelly ended this young man's dreams! We couldn't get any prints off of it, though, because the defendant was in his space suit.\nUtility Knife added to the Court Record.\nJudge:\nBy the way, Detective Fulbright... Why are the victim's helmet and right glove absent in this photograph?\nFulbright:\nWe had to remove them to identify him, Your Honor. I personally removed his glove during the investigation. We had to get his fingerprints to confirm his identity, after all.\nJudge:\nHmm... Yes, it would be very difficult to identify him without a face or fingerprints. Now, there's just one more thing I'd like to inquire about... What is this round thing next to the victim in this photo?\nBlackquill:\nSomething so important to the victim he took it with him as he escaped the launch pad. A capsule that apparently contains asteroid samples. While obviously valuable for research purposes, it has no relation to this case.\nJudge:\nHmm... I see.\nApollo:\nSo... we know that the bomb in the main building was on the second floor... ...but where was the bomb that was in Launch Pad 1 located?\nFulbright:\nHeh. That one was on the rocket itself. It was situated around the central part of the rocket. Apparently, the area around the launch pad's elevator was a sea of flames. I would like to submit this diagram and report into the record!\nBombing Report added to the Court Record.\nAthena:\nThe trial's just started and we're already in a bind.\nApollo:\nYou get used to it. Besides, that's what cross-examination is for, right? (What the two astronauts were doing during the bombing... That'll be the key!)\nCross Examination\n-- Details of the Case --\nFulbright:\nJust before the rocket was set to launch, two bombs went off. BOOM! BOOM!\nPress\nApollo:\nApollo:\nHow powerful were the explosions?\nFulbright:\nWell, the one in the main building wasn't strong enough to bring the place down... ...but the room it went off in was burned black! Thankfully, nobody was hurt. Due in large part, of course, to me stepping up to lead the evacuation!\nApollo:\nWait. What were you doing there in the first place, Detective Fulbright?\nFulbright:\nHa ha ha! I'm Bobby Fulbright, hero of justice! I'll be there, wherever and whenever people need my help! I'd go to the other side of the world, or even the edge of the universe!\nApollo:\n(I'm not sure he knows how far that actually is... But I guess I'll leave that one alone.)\nBlackquill:\nAdmirable decision, Justice-dono.\nFulbright:\nHuh? What'd he decide...?\nApollo:\nAnyway, could you describe what it was like at the Space Center at that time?\nFulbright:\nThe bomb cut the power to the central bank of elevators and the third floor lounge. It was pitch black in there, I tell you. However, the security cameras and whatnot were running on emergency backup.\nApollo:\nAnd how did the evacuation go?\nFulbright:\nI immediately and heroically whisked people down to the Space Center's basement shelter!\nJudge:\nThe basement shelter?\nFulbright:\nYes, there's an emergency shelter beneath the Space Center!\nAthena:\nAn emergency shelter, huh? Oh, here it is! It's at the bottom of the diagram. The Space Center's pretty impressive to have its own shelter!\nEvacuation Report added to the Court Record.\nApollo:\n(Hmm... The power outage and evacuation seem unrelated to the murder at this point. I guess I'll leave that aside for now.) So there were two explosions in total, correct?\nFulbright:\nYup. That's right!\nPress (subsequent times)\nApollo:\nApollo:\nHow powerful were the explosions?\nFulbright:\nWell, the one in the main building wasn't strong enough to bring the place down... ...but the room it went off in was burned black! Thankfully, nobody was hurt. Due in large part, of course, to me stepping up to lead the evacuation!\nApollo:\nWait. What were you doing there in the first place, Detective Fulbright?\nFulbright:\nHa ha ha! I'm Bobby Fulbright, hero of justice! I'll be there, wherever and whenever people need my help! I'd go to the other side of the world, or even the edge of the universe!\nApollo:\n(I'm not sure he knows how far that actually is... But I guess I'll leave that one alone.)\nBlackquill:\nAdmirable decision, Justice-dono.\nFulbright:\nHuh? What'd he decide...?\nApollo:\nAnyway, could you describe what it was like at the Space Center at that time?\nFulbright:\nThe bomb cut the power to the central bank of elevators and the third floor lounge. It was pitch black in there, I tell you. However, the security cameras and whatnot were running on emergency backup.\nApollo:\nAnd how did the evacuation go?\nFulbright:\nI immediately and heroically whisked people down to the Space Center's basement shelter!\nJudge:\nThe basement shelter?\nFulbright:\nYes, there's an emergency shelter beneath the Space Center!\nAthena:\nAn emergency shelter, huh? Oh, here it is! It's at the bottom of the diagram. The Space Center's pretty impressive to have its own shelter!\nApollo:\n(Hmm... The power outage and evacuation seem unrelated to the murder at this point. I guess I'll leave that aside for now.) So there were two explosions in total, correct?\nFulbright:\nYup. That's right!\nFulbright:\nOne on the second floor of the Space Center's main building and one in Launch Pad 1.\nPress\nApollo:\nApollo:\nLet me get this straight... Mr. Starbuck rigged a rocket he was going to board with explosives?\nFulbright:\nHuh? What are you talking about?\nApollo:\nIf the defendant really did plant the bomb on his own rocket... ...he'd get caught in the explosion as well!\nJudge:\nOh! I hadn't thought of that!\nBlackquill:\n...Hmph. Fine. A simpleton for a simpleton. Fool Bright. The motive.\nFulbright:\nUnderstood! The defendant actually had astrophobia.\nApollo:\nA... Astrophobia? What's that?\nFulbright:\nA fear of space, naturally. Just the thought of space can cause the afflicted to freeze up. And so, in his terror, the defendant found a way to stop the launch at the last minute!\nApollo:\nTh-That's absurd!\nFulbright:\nUnfortunately for you, we have evidence! Take a look at these!\nApollo:\n...What are they?\nFulbright:\nThese anti-anxiety tablets were found among the defendant's possessions! Apparently, he was taking them in secret to quell his fears.\nBlackquill:\nThere were a multitude of problems with the rocket Mr. Starbuck rode seven years ago. Rumor has it, it threatened to crash a number of times as well. That was, of course, very traumatic for Mr. Starbuck.\nApollo:\nApollo:\nBut that doesn't mean he'd go so far as to blow up his own ship!\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nThe defendant couldn't bear to mar his good name, now could he? No, not after the media had branded him \"Sol Starbuck: space pioneer extraordinaire.\" Given these conditions, the defendant could hardly run away like some base mutt.\nApollo:\nWhat, so THAT'S why you think he resorted to the bombing?\nBlackquill:\nNaturally. He constructed this act of sabotage in an attempt to blow up the Space Center... ...which would effectively abort the launch, but spare his reputation.\nApollo:\n............Urgh!\nFulbright:\nNow I'm sure you understand why we have to bring justice down on this atrocious criminal!\nFulbright:\nThankfully, only the two astronauts were in Launch Pad 1 at the time.\nPress\nApollo:\nApollo:\nAre you sure it was only the two of them?!\nFulbright:\nIt was before the spaceship was set to launch, so of course it was only those two!\nApollo:\nUngh... Well, there could've been somebody else inside that rocket!\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nThe notion of a third party in Launch Pad 1 is utterly absurd. Just to enter the area from the lounge... ...one must pass through a door guarded by a fingerprint recognition device. And allow me to state up front that there are precious few with the clearance to do so.\nJudge:\nA fingerprint recognition device? It sounds as futuristic and complex as a space center!\nFulbright:\nActually, it's not as amazing as you think, Your Honor. Take a look at this photo! This is the door in the lounge with the fingerprint lock. Only personnel whose fingerprints are registered can pass through.\nJudge:\nHmm, I see... That is very different from what I had in mind. And is there a record of the number of people that passed through that door yesterday?\nFulbright:\nYes, there were only three: the defendant, the victim, and... ...the director of the Space Center, Yuri Cosmos.\nApollo:\nThen doesn't that mean it's possible that the director is the one who did it?\nBlackquill:\nNot a chance. He was in the main building when the bombs exploded at 9:28... ...doing his job directing the launch. Besides having an alibi, he has no motive for committing these senseless acts.\nApollo:\n(He has a point... I guess the director can't be considered a suspect then.)\nLaunch Pad 1 Door Lock added to the Court Record.\nPress (subsequent times)\nApollo:\nApollo:\nAre you sure it was only the two of them?!\nFulbright:\nIt was before the spaceship was set to launch, so of course it was only those two!\nApollo:\nUngh... Well, there could've been somebody else inside that rocket!\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nThe notion of a third party in Launch Pad 1 is utterly absurd.

Besides having an alibi, he has no motive for committing these senseless acts.\nApollo:\n(He has a point... I guess the director can't be considered a suspect then.)\nFulbright:\nThe two of them managed to make it back as far as the boarding lounge...\nPress\nApollo:\nApollo:\nSo, while it would appear that the pair barely escaped with their lives, in actuality... ...one of them had already been murdered inside the rocket. That's the angle the prosecution wants to push, correct?\nFulbright:\nYou got it! In fact, that's what I've been trying to say this whole time! If the victim had been alive, he would've for sure tried to stop the bombing.\nApollo:\nIs there any chance Mr. Terran could have been killed before he boarded the rocket?\nFulbright:\nThey were both alive and well at boarding time, and embarked under their own power! Their hearts full of hopes and dreams of space!\nApollo:\n(And then both of their hopes and dreams were dashed...)\nFulbright:\nIf I may continue my explanation! After the evacuation order was given... ...the defendant made his escape, carrying the victim to make it look like a rescue.\nFulbright:\n...but after the escape, one of the two was found stabbed to death!\nPress\nApollo:\nApollo:\nAnd who was the first to find the victim?\nFulbright:\nActually, there were two of them!\nBlackquill:\nThe Space Center director... ...Yuri Cosmos... ...and Detective Candice Arme.\nJudge:\nOne of them was a detective?!\nFulbright:\nYup. Detective Arme specializes in bombings, you see. She and the director were ordering the evacuation following the explosions. They were also worried about the astronauts, so they hurried over to the boarding lounge. That's when they discovered the victim along with the defendant!\nApollo:\n(Two witnesses, huh? And one of them is a detective! I doubt either one would have anything to say that would help me...)\nAthena:\nHmm... It's like he's trying to give us as little information as possible.\nApollo:\nMaybe Prosecutor Blackquill's got his tongue...\nAthena:\nWell, don't let that hold you back. Keep pressing until we get what we need!\nAfter pressing first, second, third, and fifth statements:\nJudge:\nI think that pretty much covers the details of the case. Only the victim and the defendant were on the launch pad when the former was killed. If this is the truth, then only Mr. Starbuck could have carried out this crime.\nApollo:\n(What little I could get out of him only hurt my case.)\nBlackquill:\nHmph. Justice-dono, foolish is the warrior who rushes headlong into battle. Preparation is an essential element of battle, so I advise you to take a gander at this.\nApollo:\nWhat is it...?\nBlackquill:\nFootage from a security camera. As the two astronauts emerged from the bowels of the Launch Pad 1 Corridor... ... the boarding lounge security camera captured their desperate escape. Now, I would direct your attention to what the defendant is shouldering... ...which you can see, is none other than... the lifeless body of the victim.\nApollo:\nWh..... Whaaaaaaaat?!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order I say! This... This lines up exactly with what the prosecution has been asserting!\nApollo:\nI should've known Blackquill would have something like this ready.\nSecurity Camera Video added to the Court Record.\nAthena:\nUm, Apollo...? How exactly did they determine that Clay was... already gone in that footage?\nApollo:\n.........Ah, I see what you mean! Whether Clay was still alive at that point IS pretty crucial. Your Honor! Please take another look at the footage. Isn't it possible that Mr. Terran was still alive here and that Mr. Starbuck was helping him?!\nJudge:\nWhy, I believe you're right. One man carrying the other to safety... What a beautiful expression of friendship...\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nHmph. Perhaps that's what it looks like to a one-eyed hothead and a dotard... But it only makes sense if it's the victim's dead body.\nApollo:\nWhat do you mean?\nBlackquill:\n...Fool Bright, explain it to Justice-dono.\nFulbright:\nYou got it! Ready, kid? If the murder had occurred in the lounge, someone could've spotted it. Anyone can enter the lounge, after all. But doing it while they were alone in the spaceship? That's a horse of a different color!\nApollo:\nApollo:\nBut you can't deny that there's a possibility the murder could've happened in the lounge! All that video shows is a man helping his fellow astronaut out!\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nYour assertion... is based on emotion. It's based in your belief that Mr. Starbuck would surely help his own disciple. But you have no logical explanation as to why the victim could still be alive.\nApollo:\nUrk!\nJudge:\nUnfortunately, Mr. Justice, the prosecution is right. Your argument is lacking in sound logic.\nApollo:\n(But it sounded perfectly logical to me...)\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Justice? If you have no further objections... ...I believe it's time to bring this cross-examination to a close.\nApollo:\nObjections...? Well, I, uh...\nAthena:\nAthena:\nYour Honor! The defense requests a little time to think and regroup.\nJudge:\nHmm... Given the facts, I'm not sure I see the need...\nApollo:\nWhat is it, Athena?\nAthena:\nIt's just... There's something that's been bothering me.\nBlackquill:\nHmph. If it isn't the defense stalling for time, as always. ............Very well, I'm feeling generous. You may have a small measure of time.\nAthena:\nYes!\nBlackquill:\nYou have......... five seconds.\nAthena:\nF-FIVE SECONDS?!\nBlackquill:\nAfter that, I declare this cross-examination to be closed, and a verdict to be rendered. Your Baldness! Raise your gavel high. It's time for a countdown!\nJudge:\nOh... OH!\nBlackquill:\nReady?\nApollo:\nWe don't have time! Spit it out, Athena!\nJudge:\nOnly three more seconds!\nAthena:\nAck! L-Look! I don't think the prosecution's explanation is very complete.\nApollo:\nMeaning?!\nAthena:\nMeaning there's something missing -- like they conveniently left it unexplained...\nApollo:\nSomething they didn't explain... Something they didn't explain... .........Ah! You're right! I think I know what you're talking about!\nJudge:\nYour five seconds are up, Mr. Justice. Is there anything about the prosecution's argument that you'd like to rebut?\nApollo:\nY-Yes, Your Honor! Actually, there is! There is something the prosecution has yet to make clear to this court!\nJudge:\nHmm... Well, if you put it that way... What is it that the prosecution has failed to explain?\nThe motive for murder\nApollo:\nThe prosecution hasn't explained the defendant's motive yet, have they?\nJudge:\nHm? But didn't they just explain... ...that Mr. Terran was a threat to the success of the bombing, so he had to be disposed of?\nApollo:\nAh! No, wait! Time out, Your Honor!\nJudge:\n\"Time out,\" Mr. Justice? This is hardly a sporting event.\nApollo:\nAck. (That didn't score me any points... Time to put my game face on.)\nLeads back to:\n\"What is it that the prosecution has failed to explain?\"\nWhy the body was moved\nLeads to:\n\"They have failed to explain why Mr. Starbuck would bother bringing the body back at all.\"\nApollo:\nThey have failed to explain why Mr. Starbuck would bother bringing the body back at all. If the defendant wanted to kill the victim, why didn't he just leave the body in the rocket? Why go  through the trouble of bringing him all the way back to the boarding lounge?\nJudge:\nOh! That's true! I don't think we've heard the prosecution's thoughts on that yet.\nApollo:\nThat's because they have none, Your Honor. After all, how does one explain something so illogical?\nBlackquill:\n............\nApollo:\nThe prosecution is claiming that the defendant moved the victim's dead body. But what if the entire premise of that argument is wrong?\nJudge:\nThen let's hear your theory, Mr. Justice.\nApollo:\nThe defense proposes that the defendant didn't kill the victim! He was helping him! Aaaaack!\nBlackquill:\nFool Bright. Explain it for our sad friend here before I nod off to his monotone monologue. Inform him exactly why Space Boy moved the victim.\nApollo:\nHuh? (They've gotta be joking...)\nFulbright:\nIt's simple! Mr. Starbuck did what he did to direct suspicion away from himself! He wanted to create the impression he heroically risked his life to save his partner! That's why he made sure to make it to the security camera so there'd be a record!\nBlackquill:\nAt the very least, he appears to have achieved success with you and the old man.\nApollo:\nAh!\nJudge:\nOne man carrying the other to safety... What a beautiful expression of friendship...\nBlackquill:\nThe average person wearing a space suit weighs easily over two hundred pounds. (Changed from [The average person wearing a space suit weighs easily over 200 pounds.] in the original release) Saving the life of a partner who weighs as much, while trying to escape deadly flames... What a dramatic sob story fit for the silver screen.\nJudge:\nIndeed. I was completely taken in by the humanity of the story.\nBlackquill:\nYou see? Yet the true ending is that all traces of his hammy act were meant to be blown up. Yes, and now we arrive at the thrilling conclusion: the third explosion!\nAthena:\nAthena:\nWhat are you talking about? There was no third explosion!\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nIndeed, you are correct. But that is thanks to Detective Arme. It was she who identified and secured the bomb. However, it doesn't change the fact that the third bomb was discovered in the lounge. The steel coffin beside the witness stand. That would be... a bomb transport case. We used that to transport the deactivated bomb here. It was found in the lounge... A bomb in the form of a most distasteful toy.\nAthena:\nWHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!\nBlackquill:\nOne on the second floor of the main building, one on the launch pad, and one in the lounge. The defendant planned to set off three firework displays. Fortunately, the third one was discovered before it could be detonated, for had it not... ...the victim's body and other vital evidence would surely have been immolated.\nApollo:\nApollo:\nGaaagh!\nBlackquill:\nBefore you utter a word, know that the evidence supports me.\nApollo:\n(Ugh... It's like he's reading my mind...)\nBlackquill:\nAs it is still undergoing forensic investigation, I do not have the evidence on hand. However, know that a peculiar item was found in one of Mr. Starbuck's pockets. Specifically, a bomb detonation switch...\nApollo:\nYou found whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!\nBlackquill:\nI suspect the defendant had no time to destroy such damning evidence... ...when the Space Center director and Detective Arme stumbled across the murder. So he thought to hide it in his pocket... feeble-brained that he is.\nApollo:\nAaaaaaagh... No! Mr. Starbuck would never do anything like that! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!\nBlackquill:\nJustice-dono, open your eyes and see the truth.\nJudge:\nHmm, this appears to be irrefutable evidence that the accused set off the explosions.\nApollo:\n(No! There has to be some kind of mistake! This can't be the \"truth\"!)\nBlackquill:\nStill can't accept it? You'll believe in your client, come what may? ............Then why don't you cross-examine the defendant himself?\nApollo:\n(......This has got to be a trap.)\nAthena:\nIt's like Blackquill's controlling the entire game.\nApollo:\nYeah. It seemed like he was waiting for me to bring up the body moving issue.\nAthena:\nWhy do you say that?\nApollo:\nBecause he had just the right argument when I pointed it out... ...and to really rub it in, he had a decisive piece of evidence up his sleeve, too. He was trying to shake my faith in Mr. Starbuck and break me down!\nAthena:\nThen, making you cross-examine Mr. Starbuck at this point was part of his plan, too...? Totally underhanded, but I wouldn't expect anything less from him.\nBlackquill:\nNow, let us hear from the archvillain, the fiendish murderer himself. Famed astronaut, Solomon Starbuck!\nJudge:\nWitness, your name and occupation, please.\nStarbuck:\nSolomon Starbuck. Astronaut... Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... How did this happen?\nJudge:\nMr. Starbuck, you aren't looking very well. Will you be able to give testimony?\nStarbuck:\nHaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh............ No.\nJudge:\n............Well, unfortunately, \"no\" is not an option. You are being accused of the Space Center bombing and the murder of Clay Terran. Please testify to these allegations.\nStarbuck:\nHaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... Umm... Mind if I take this suit off? It's getting really heavy...\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nIt's not the weight of the suit that you feel, but of your sins. Prepare to carry that weight for the rest of your life...\nStarbuck:\n............Banish me to the moon... I don't care anymore...\nAthena:\nWow... That was super-negative... Is he going to be all right up there?\nApollo:\nH-He'll be fine! I think... (As long as he doesn't totally give up and say he did it, that is.)\nWitness Testimony\n-- I Didn't Kill Him --\nStarbuck:\nAll I did was support Clay over my shoulder and get us out of the rocket!\nLike always, I took the elevator down to the middle level and headed for the corridor.\nClay had passed out by the time we got the order to evacuate.\nI didn't kill Clay! I was trying to save him!\nJudge:\nHmm... So you assert you didn't set off the bombs or murder the victim?\nStarbuck:\nHa ha. Ha ha ha... But I bet you think I'm lying, right?\nJudge:\nI reserve all judgment until after I've heard your full testimony.\nStarbuck:\nHaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... I'm sure you don't believe me. I bet you don't even believe I'm an astronaut.\nApollo:\n(I don't think the judge doubts THAT!)\nAthena:\nWho'd wear a suit like that EXCEPT an astronaut...\nJudge:\nHmm... I will say that when I saw you in that movie... ...you appeared quite courageous, though I suppose reality never quite lives up to fantasy.\nStarbuck:\nHaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... I guess I'm just a big disappointment... Ha ha. Ha ha ha. Ha ha... I really don't care what happens anymore. Ha ha ha...\nApollo:\n(Oh, no! He's completely give up!)\n???:\nHaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh...\nBlackquill:\nHmph. What a depressing fellow. If you were to join me in the clink... ...I imagine that annoying sighing of yours would rub off on the other inmates.\nAthena:\nLike how it rubbed off on Prosecutor Blackquill a second ago?\nApollo:\n(Huh? That was Blackquill sighing? Mr. Starbuck's testimony contains a glaring contradiction. The question is, what does it mean? Even if Mr. Starbuck is my client, I can't be gun-shy now! It's time to find out the truth!)\nCross Examination\n-- I Didn't Kill Him --\nStarbuck:\nAll I did was support Clay over my shoulder and get us out of the rocket!\nPress\nApollo:\nApollo:\nSo what you're saying is that the victim was still alive at that time?\nStarbuck:\nOf course! He was alive and well!\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nIf so, then you took a man who was alive and well... ...and silenced him permanently with this?\nStarbuck:\nWhat?! No! Aaaaagh! Black hole confirmed, dead ahead. Aaaaaaaaaaaaah! It's no good, captain! I'm getting sucked iiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnn!\nApollo:\nApollo:\nM-Mr. Starbuck! You are not in space! Please give your testimony seriously!\nStarbuck:\nI-It was just nerves, but maybe I shouldn't have said he was \"alive and well.\" It was more like he was slumped over.\nApollo:\n(Those are complete opposite ends of the spectrum!)\nStarbuck:\nLike always, I took the elevator down to the middle level and headed for the corridor.\nPress\nApollo:\nApollo:\nIs that the elevator inside the launch pad area?\nStarbuck:\nThat's right. We always use it to get to and from the cockpit.\nAthena:\nThat makes sense. So he was just using the route he always used.\nApollo:\nIn spite of the fact that there had just been an explosion...?\nAthena:\n...Huh?\nApollo:\n(I think Mr. Starbuck is hiding something. Something pretty big...)\nPresent Bombing Report\nApollo:\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Starbuck, I need your testimony to be as accurate as possible.\"\nStarbuck:\nClay had passed out by the time we got the order to evacuate.\nPress\nApollo:\nApollo:\nPassed out? Why was he passed out?\nStarbuck:\nProbably because of the explosion. The noise and vibration were incredible. It's little wonder a person would pass out, right?\nApollo:\nI-I guess...? (Not that I'd know...)\nStarbuck:\nAaaaagh! I've been hit by space debris! The main engine's on fire! It's gonna blow! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!\nApollo:\nY-Yes, I see... I guess it does make sense that someone would pass out... (Especially if the person in question is Mr. Starbuck...)\nStarbuck:\nA-Anyway!\nStarbuck:\nI didn't kill Clay! I was trying to save him!\nPress\nApollo:\nApollo:\nDon't worry! I understand. I'll make sure everything turns out all right!\nStarbuck:\n............But everyone's glaring at me like I did it.\nAthena:\nApollo, you have to reassure him better than that!\nApollo:\nAnd how am I supposed to do that?!\nAthena:\nTry to imagine how he's feeling, and use that to figure out how to boost his confidence.\nApollo:\nMr. Starbuck, think back to what Clay used to always say. It's times like these when he would repeat, \"I'm fine!\" to himself.\nStarbuck:\n\"I'm fine\"...? Yeah, I guess he did say that a lot... Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... But even if I shout it, Clay will still be dead. Haaangh... What's the use...?\nApollo:\n............Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... (Could somebody please reassure me now?)\nAthena:\nApollo, there's something strange about Mr. Starbuck's testimony.\nApollo:\nYeah, I was thinking the same thing. There's a glaring contradiction. I just wonder why it's there and what it means for our case.\nAthena:\nWell, it doesn't look like he's lying, at least...\nApollo:\n............ (Guess I'll have to show some evidence.)\nApollo:\nMr. Starbuck, I need your testimony to be as accurate as possible.\nStarbuck:\nW-Was I not being accurate?\nApollo:\nNo, because it's impossible for you to have taken the elevator down to the middle level.\nJudge:\nWhat makes you say that, Mr. Justice?\nApollo:\nPlease recall where the bomb went off in Launch Pad 1. Also recall that after the explosion, the middle level elevator was engulfed in flames.\nJudge:\nOh! You're right. Which means...\nApollo:\nExactly. The launch pad's elevator would've been unusable. In other words... ...Mr. Starbuck, your statement is decidedly inconsistent with the facts! Wh-What's with the helmet?\nStarbuck:\nAaaaaagh! Mission command! Mission command! Do you read me?! Come in, please!\nApollo:\nApollo:\nThis is mission command... I order you to PAY ATTENTION! Stop this nonsense and answer my questions, Mr. Starbuck!\nStarbuck:\nAaaaagh! M-My helmet! Ah! My oxygen taaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaank! Oxygen concentration and body temperature declining! Requesting medical assistance! Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!\nJudge:\nM-Mr. Starbuck! We are not in space right now! Please stop pretending you have lost consciousness and stand back up!\nStarbuck:\nI-I apologize, Your Honor. I forgot I was still on Earth.\nAthena:\nI feel like we all just got a real glimpse of Solomon Starbuck the astronaut.\nApollo:\nYeah, he seemed more like an astronaut now than when he was doing all that sighing. Mr. Starbuck, could you please explain the inconsistency in your statement? About how you used the middle level elevator?\nStarbuck:\nI, uh... was nervous, and I said the wrong thing! I'm sorry! I actually, uh, took a different route, I think.\nApollo:\nA different route?\nBlackquill:\n............I hope you're able to deliver a straight story this time.\nStarbuck:\nAck! I-I-I'll get it right this time! Maybe. No, I mean, probably!\nBlackquill:\nProbably...?\nJudge:\nIt's understandable to be nervous, but let me remind you that accuracy is paramount in court.\nWitness Testimony\n-- My Escape Route --\nStarbuck:\nLet's see... Uh, my escape route... What I said before was a mistake.\nI, uh, I remember now! I took a different route... Maybe... Probably...\nWith the capsule and Clay in my arms, I made my way down from the upper level.\nApollo:\nSo you're saying you escaped without using the elevator?\nStarbuck:\nTh-That's right! There's a ladder that spans the upper and middle levels. I used that ladder to get to the middle level. Luckily, the fire hadn't reached the ladder, so we could make our escape that way.\nApollo:\nAnd the capsule you mentioned... I suppose you mean the thing next to Mr. Terran here? Was the capsule that important that you'd risk your life to take it with you?\nStarbuck:\nIt almost goes without saying, but yeah! That capsule contains asteroid samples. Therefore it's invaluable as research material. With his space suit on, Clay weighed a ton, but securing the capsule was also important.\nApollo:\nI need you to answer to the best of your ability! Mr. Starbuck! Please remember that your verdict is riding on your testimony!\nStarbuck:\nHa ha... ha ha ha... Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... Maybe I am guilty after all. I wonder if you can see the stars in prison? Bet it's more comfortable than a spaceship.\nCross Examination\n-- My Escape Route --\nStarbuck:\nLet's see... Uh, my escape route... What I said before was a mistake.\nPress\nApollo:\nApollo:\nHow could you mistake such a basic fact?!\nStarbuck:\nHey, everybody makes mistakes, but try thinking about the vastness of space instead. From Earth, it takes four light-years to travel to our nearest neighboring star. So you see? Compared to the vast expanse of space, human error is insignificant.\nApollo:\n(I wish he'd consider it just a little more significant than zero...)\nBlackquill:\nEnough jabbering. Get on with your testimony.\nStarbuck:\nUngh...\nStarbuck:\nI, uh, I remember now! I took a different route... Maybe... Probably...\nPress\nApollo:\nApollo:\n\"Maybe\"? \"Probably\"? Did I hear you right, Mr. Starbuck?!\nStarbuck:\nI-I didn't say either of those things! Aaaaagh! Mission control! Come in, please! An error has occurred in the sound system! Activate the emergency tin can telephone! Oh, nooooooo! Tin can telephones are ineffective in the vacuum of space!\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nStop this nonsense or I will sever you AND your tin can telephone.\nStarbuck:\nAll right! I'm begging you! I'll tell the truth! Just don't sever anything!\nAthena:\nApollo, is he going to be all right?\nApollo:\nI'm... starting to think he's not...\nStarbuck:\nUm, let's see... So about when we were running away...\nStarbuck:\nWith the capsule and Clay in my arms, I made my way down from the upper level.\nPress\nApollo:\nApollo:\nThe upper level of the launch pad area...?\nStarbuck:\nTh-That's right! That's what I said, isn't it?!\nApollo:\n(Granted, that route does exist...) So, to recap, you had Clay over your right shoulder and the capsule in your left hand?\nStarbuck:\nYeah! It's really important, so I couldn't let it get burned up. So, even though Clay was really heavy, I couldn't afford to carry him with both hands. I did the best I could with him over one shoulder and the capsule in my other hand.\nApollo:\n(............I don't think the meaning of what he just said has hit him yet...)\nBlackquill:\n...Hmph. You know what you have to do with that statement, Justice-dono!\nApollo:\nY-Yes, I know! (Well, I've come this far. No turning back now. It's time to present some evidence!)\nPresent Space Center Diagram\nApollo:\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Starbuck, why don't you just tell the truth?\"\nAthena:\nSo Mr. Starbuck escaped with Clay and the capsule, which means... ...it's just like in the footage. I can see why he couldn't run, though.\nApollo:\nHe must've weighed over two hundred pounds just by himself. (Changed from [He must've weighed over 200 pounds just by himself.] in the original release)\nAthena:\nYeah, and he had to support Clay, who was another two hundred pounds. (Changed from [Yeah, and he had to support Clay, who was another 200 pounds.] in the original release) Plus, he had to ensure the safety of that capsule. I don't think I could've even walked under those circumstances.\nApollo:\n(Walking straight forward is probably about all I would've been able to manage...)\nApollo:\nMr. Starbuck, why don't you just tell the truth?\nStarbuck:\nTh-The truth? Um, let's see... The Earth is blue...? No, no. That's not right. So, uh... I guess the Earth isn't blue? Yeah, that's it!\nApollo:\nThe truth, Mr. Starbuck!\nStarbuck:\nGawrh! The oxygen concentration is super low in this area! Prepare the emergency oxygen tanks!\nJudge:\nMr. Justice, the witness appears confused. Please help draw out the truth from him.\nApollo:\nMr. Starbuck, under the circumstances at the time... ...you couldn't possibly have reached the boarding lounge via the upper level route.\nStarbuck:\nHuh?\nApollo:\nNot as long as this was along the escape route!\nPresent Ladder\nApollo:\nLeads to:\n\"To get down from the upper to the middle level where the Launch Pad 1 corridor is...\"\nPresent anywhere else\nApollo:\nStarbuck:\nHaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh...\nApollo:\nWh-What's the matter, Mr. Starbuck?\nStarbuck:\nWell, you say, \"not as long as this,\" but I don't know what the \"this\" is. Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh...\nJudge:\nI must admit I have no idea, either.\nApollo:\n(Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh...) Your Honor! Please let me try that again! Under the circumstances at the time... ...Mr. Starbuck couldn't have made it to the boarding lounge via the upper level route.\nLeads back to:\n\"Not as long as this was along the escape route!\"\nApollo:\nTo get down from the upper to the middle level where the Launch Pad 1 corridor is... ...you would have to go down the ladder, isn't that right, Mr. Starbuck?\nStarbuck:\nO-Of course! That was the only way we could escape!\nApollo:\nApollo:\nBut how would that work? At the time, you were supporting Mr. Terran over your shoulder, were you not? And remember, he was in full space gear as well, putting him at over two hundred pounds. (Changed from [And remember, he was in full space gear as well, putting him at over 200 pounds.] in the original release)\nStarbuck:\nAh! Ooooooh! W-W-Well, it's easy on the moon! Gravity is only one-sixth of what it is on Earth.\nApollo:\nApollo:\nBut the Space Center is located on Earth! Short of being an octopus, climbing a ladder with an adult male in space gear in one arm... ...while carrying the capsule in your other is impossible, wouldn't you say?\nStarbuck:\nOh...!\nApollo:\nSo, Mr. Starbuck! How exactly DID you climb down that ladder with your arms full?!\nStarbuck:\nAaaaaah!\nApollo:\nMr. Starbuck! Come clean and tell us the truth! NOW!\nStarbuck:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! Engineer! Where's that engineer?! Oxygen leak detected due to faulty maintenance! Evacuate immediately!\nApollo:\nWhat the--!? (He's flying the coop!)\nStarbuck:\nAaaaagh! Help! I'm caught on the ceiling! .........Um, help? Anyone...?\nJudge:\nBailiff! Prepare the cherry picker! We must launch our rescue mission at once!\nAthena:\nWell, that's one way to take off while being questioned...\nApollo:\nI'd rather prove his innocence so he can go to space again someday for real...\nJudge:\nNow then, Mr. Starbuck, do you think you can keep your feet planted on the ground?\nStarbuck:\nYes. I apologize for losing control.\nApollo:\nAre you ready to tell us... the truth?\nStarbuck:\nUngh... Not that... Anything but that...\nApollo:\n(What is going on? This isn't the Mr. Starbuck I know...)\nBlackquill:\n...It appears Space Boy is prone to deception. Witness!\nStarbuck:\nY-Yikes! Y-Yes...?\nBlackquill:\nI thought your story odd, but perhaps the inconsistencies can be explained as... ...the result of a medical side effect?\nStarbuck:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! Prosecutor Blackquill! Please... Please don't talk about that...\nApollo:\nW-What are you talking about, Prosecutor Blackquill?\nBlackquill:\nHmph. Didn't I already state that Space Boy is, ironically, terrified of going into space? That's why he took some \"precautions\" just before the launch. For you see, traces of this anti-anxiety drug were found in his system.\nApollo:\nOh...? (I sense things are about to nosedive...)\nStarbuck:\nStarbuck:\nY-You got it all wrong! I told 'em during the investigation, too! I don't know anything about any drugs! I never took any medication, I swear!\nApollo:\n(It was found in his system, but he doesn't remember taking it...?) How could that be?\nStarbuck:\nSomebody must've slipped them to me! B-But I guess maybe that's why I don't remember... because of the side effects... Yeah, that's why I don't remember much about what really happened!\nApollo:\nWh-Whaaaaaaaaaaat?!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order in the court!\nApollo:\n(We can't get any useful testimony out of him if he doesn't remember anything...!)\nAthena:\nWell, this certainly explains why his testimony kept changing.\nApollo:\nUngh... Why didn't he just tell me he couldn't remember?\nAthena:\nI guess he didn't want anybody to find out he was terrified of going into space.\nStarbuck:\nHaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... Maybe I really DID do it...?\nBlackquill:\nWhich brings us to the answer of our original question... ...of how the witness climbed down the ladder with a dead body.\nApollo:\nIt does? ............Um, so what is it?\nBlackquill:\nA dead man feels no pain and makes no complaints, Justice-dono. So the body was simply dropped down from the top of the ladder.\nJudge:\nOh, my! I see... And then the defendant could climb down with his free hand...\nApollo:\nApollo:\nDrop the body down?! Who would do such a disrespectable thing?! Besides, dropping the body down would leave marks on the body itself.\nBlackquill:\nSo you are capable of quick thinking. ...Yes, you are correct.\nApollo:\nReally? Oh, um, thanks...? Heh heh. Aaaaaaagh! ...Huh? What's this?\nBlackquill:\nIt's the oxygen tank from the victim's spacesuit. It's ruptured, and I'm sure you can figure out why.\nApollo:\n.........Y-You can't be implying it ruptured when the defendant dropped the victim's body!\nBlackquill:\nI am, for they fracture easily when struck.\nApollo:\nApollo:\nEven if that's true, the tank's explosion and shrapnel would leave its mark on the body. Yet, according to the autopsy report, only the knife wound was found on the victim's body. You're clearly grasping at straws with this line of reasoning!\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nA spacesuit isn't heavy for the sake of being heavy, Justice-dono. It includes the latest technological devices and is made of the fabric of tomorrow. The fabric is made to protect astronauts from the dangers of space... ...so falling a few Earth yards would hardly leave a mark on the wearer.\nApollo:\nApollo:\nThen shouldn't it be impossible to stab someone through it as well?!\nBlackquill:\nIt should, and yet, through sheer coincidence... ...the knife slipped through a weak spot in the suit's structure and found its way to its target.\nApollo:\nWh-What are the chances...?\nBlackquill:\nYou forget that our killer is an astronaut himself with knowledge of how the suits work.\nApollo:\nNngh... (He's got me there...)\nBlackquill:\nAnd now my argument has been proven. Space Boy killed the victim in the rocket and then dropped his body from the upper level. After climbing down, he shouldered the body and made sure the camera recorded them. There's no room for debate about these facts. It is clear that Solomon Starbuck is the only one who could have killed Clay Terran!\nApollo:\nGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!\nBlackquill:\nHere. The report regarding the astronauts' oxygen tanks. Consider it my send-off gift. Feel free to use it as payment to cross the river Styx.\nApollo:\nAck!\nOxygen Tank Data added to the Court Record.\nAthena:\nHey, this report is pretty detailed.\nApollo:\nLet's see... \"The display on the astronaut's left shoulder shows the oxygen remaining.\" (Changed from [Let's see... 'The display on the astronaut's left shoulder shows how much oxygen remains.'] in the original release) I guess that means these glowing cyan digits represent the amount of oxygen in the tank... (Changed from [I guess that means these glowing cyan digits represent the amount of oxygen remaining...] in the original release)\nStarbuck:\nHaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... I'm done foooooooooor! I'm going to prison instead of spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaace!\nBlackquill:\n...Space Boy.\nStarbuck:\nY-Y-Y-Yes?!\nBlackquill:\nTake heart. The bejeweled night sky is still beautiful even when viewed through bars.\nStarbuck:\nY-You mean... the stars as seen from... prison...?\nBlackquill:\nThat's right. Your cell will be your spaceship. Picture the view through the iron bars. It's like being an astronaut in your own craft for all time.\nStarbuck:\nHa ha ha. That's not a half bad thought...\nApollo:\nUm, Mr. Starbuck..? (Prosecutor Blackquill got to him good...)\nStarbuck:\nSpaceship \"Prison Cell,\" fly me, my guilt, and my despair into the deepest, darkest space. And then, let's get sucked into a black hole together!\nApollo:\nApollo:\nMr. Starbuck, you can't give up hope!\nStarbuck:\nOh...! Yes, Apollo...?\nApollo:\nYou know, Clay really looked up to you. He said you are an incredible man. He said you'd never give up your dreams and passion for space, no matter the situation.\nStarbuck:\nHe said that...?\nApollo:\nSo don't give up now and help me prove your innocence! For the sake of the man who respected you and believe in you -- Clay Terran!\nStarbuck:\nFor Clay...!\nBlackquill:\n...Hmph. You're wasting your breath.\nStarbuck:\nUnnnh... Nngh... Raaaaaaaaaaaaagh! RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! GRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!\nStarbuck:\n............Apollo, thank you! I can see things clearly now!\nApollo:\nMr. Starbuck!\nStarbuck:\nI'm... I'm fine now -- thanks for reminding me of my life's mission.\nApollo:\nRight. We'll both be fine! I'll prove you're innocent. You'll see! And after that, we'll get you back into space!\nStarbuck:\nRaaaaaaaaahhhh! You've ignited the booster rockets of my soooouuuul! I'm on fiiiiiiiiiiire!!! I am Solomon Starbuck, astronaut! A cosmic hero chosen by the universe itself! This is no time to be whimpering and crying! I can't let you and Clay down!\nBlackquill:\nBalderdash.\nStarbuck:\nThe sun... the moon... all of space is calling me! Solomon \"Sol\" Starbuck! Ready for launch! Begin the countdown! Five!\nApollo:\nFour!\nAthena:\nThree!\nJudge:\nTwo!\nOne!\nStarbuck:\nLIFT OFF!\nJudge:\nWell! I feel like I've witnessed an actual rocket launch!\nAthena:\nApollo! You did it! You broke Prosecutor Blackquill's grip over Mr. Starbuck!\nApollo:\nI can't take the credit. It was all Mr. Starbuck. He pulled himself through.\nBlackquill:\nHmph. If you simpletons are done massaging one another's egos... No matter how positive your mood, my advantage remains unshakable. I have but to wait for the final guilty verdict. Isn't that right, Your Baldness?\nApollo:\nGah... (I can't let up now! I have to stop Blackquill! I have to see this through... Mr. Starbuck just has to make it back into space! I won't allow Clay's dream to remain unfulfilled! I've got to destroy Blackquill's argument somehow! Think, Justice! Think! If the only people at Launch Pad 1 were Clay and Mr. Starbuck... ...and if Clay was already dead by the time this footage was taken... ...then the only person who could've killed him is Mr. Starbuck. So the only way to counter Blackquill's argument is... ... if I can prove that Clay was still alive when they arrived at the boarding lounge. In which case, I should be able to find some contradiction in the evidence itself! Now, let's see... About this data that we just received... This supposedly proves that Mr. Starbuck dropped Clay's body in Launch Pad 1. But if I'm going to prove that false, then there must be something I can use here.)\nBlackquill:\nEnough of this farce, Your Baldness! Let's have your verdict!\nApollo:\nApollo:\nProsecutor Blackquill, you seem to be in quite a hurry to rush the verdict. But about this oxygen tank data you submitted just now... ...it says that Mr. Starbuck's tank had 80 percent remaining while Mr. Terran's had 0. Do you stand by the accuracy of this report?\nBlackquill:\nOf course.\nApollo:\n............Then I guess it simply means that it's faulty, as evidence goes.\nBlackquill:\nYou will explain what you mean, Justice-dono.\nApollo:\nIt's simple. This evidence contradicts the facts of this case. Take a look here at the detailed description and you'll see what I mean.\nJudge:\nI hope you have some evidence, Mr. Justice, because I don't see what's so contradictory!\nApollo:\nY-Yes, Your Honor! Right away! This is the evidence that the oxygen tank report stands in contradiction to!\nPresent Security Camera Video\nApollo:\nLeads to:\n\"And how does this evidence present a contradiction?\"\nPresent anything else\nApollo:\nJudge:\nAnd how does this evidence present a contradiction?\nApollo:\n...If you think about it on a cosmic level, this world is full of inconsistencies! Wouldn't you agree that this evidence is just one of those mysteries of the universe?\nJudge:\nNo, I wouldn't. But I am going to give you a cosmic penalty.\nApollo:\n(Too bad he didn't take a more cosmic view of things and forgive me on that one...) Your Honor! Please let me try that again! (I think the problem must lie in the remaining oxygen in the two tanks... Mr. Starbuck's tank was 80 percent full, while Clay's was at 0 percent. Can I find something that contradicts this information?)\nLeads back to:\n\"This is the evidence that the oxygen tank report stands in contradiction to!\"\nJudge:\nAnd how does this evidence present a contradiction?\nApollo:\nThe problem is this part here.\nPresent oxygen tank display\nApollo:\nLeads to:\n\"Note the remaining oxygen in Mr. Starbuck's tank as he carries Mr. Terran.\"\nPresent anywhere else\nApollo:\nJudge:\nHmm? And what problem do you see with that part?\nApollo:\nWhat? Oh, um... I just thought it looked... problematic, you know? Don't tell me I'm the only one who thinks so!\nJudge:\nYou're the only one. And you'll be the only one to receive this penalty, too.\nApollo:\nUngh... (One is the loneliest number... But now that I'm looking at it, I definitely see something strange in this footage.) Your Honor! Please allow me to give that another try!\nLeads back to:\n\"The problem is this part here.\"\nApollo:\nNote the remaining oxygen in Mr. Starbuck's tank as he carries Mr. Terran.\nJudge:\nHmm... It appears to say 50.\nApollo:\nYes, but according to the data, our client's tank had 80 percent remaining.\nJudge:\nThe oxygen in the tank increased?\nApollo:\nI see Your Honor finds it as strange as I do. It's bad enough that there is a contradiction, but the increase in oxygen is beyond illogical!\nJudge:\nOh, my! You're absolutely right! What is going on here?\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nHmph. I, too, find it odd that the oxygen remaining has increased. It would be as odd as if my rations were to increase. But what does that prove? It doesn't change the fact that it is the defendant carrying the victim's corpse!\nApollo:\nApollo:\nHeh. I'm going to bet you don't get more rations because you don't abide by the rules. Either way, the oxygen remaining shouldn't increase, just as your rations don't increase. Therefore, this new information is critical! We can't overlook it!\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nIn that case, do you have an answer to this riddle of the mysteriously increasing oxygen? You'd better not disappoint, or I'll declare the inconsistency as mere equipment malfunction.\nApollo:\nErk!\nJudge:\nHmm... Prosecutor Blackquill has a point. I suppose it could be a simple malfunction. Mr. Justice. If you cannot provide an adequate counterargument to this point... ...I'm afraid I must bring this trial to an end. So, do you think you can explain why the remaining oxygen level increased?\nApollo:\nO-Of course I can! (The thing to do at a time like this is turn my thinking around! Mr. Starbuck has no memory of it, but he claims to have carried Clay. So this man with the 50 on his tank ought to be Mr. Starbuck. But, if anything, the display on his oxygen tank should have shown an 80. This is a clear contradiction between the report and the security footage. So what I should be asking is not, \"Why did the oxygen level increase?\"... ...but, \"What had to have happened to make it LOOK like it increased?\" Am I making some kind of mistake in my base assumptions here...?)\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Justice? We're waiting.\nApollo:\nYes, Your Honor! I'm ready to answer! This is why the remaining oxygen appears to have increased!\nThey were going the other way\nApollo:\nMaybe they were escaping in the opposite direction.\nJudge:\nThe opposite direction? Like how rewinding a video makes things look like they're repairing themselves? ...In which case, I think the one who's going to need rewinding is you, Mr. Justice. Penalty!\nApollo:\n(Ugh... I'd rather fast-forward through this myself... \"What had to have happened to make it LOOK like it increased?\" Wait a minute! I think I've got it!)\nLeads back to:\n\"This is why the remaining oxygen appears to have increased!\"\nThe victim was carrying the defendant\nLeads to:\n\"What if it was the other way around?\"\nThe tanks were damaged\nApollo:\nThe answer is simple. The tanks were damaged! Ack!\nBlackquill:\nI don't think the problem is with the tanks, but with your eyes, Justice-dono. It's written in the report that the tanks were functioning properly.\nApollo:\nAck! It's amazing how diligent reporting can come back to bite you in the rear.\nJudge:\nAnd it's amazing how your diligent negligence can come back to bite you in the rear, too! Let this penalty remind you of the consequences of your actions!\nApollo:\n(Ow, my aching rear... Let's try that again. \"What had to have happened to make it LOOK like it increased?\" Wait a minute! I think I've got it!)\nLeads back to:\n\"This is why the remaining oxygen appears to have increased!\"\nApollo:\nWhat if it was the other way around?\nJudge:\nThe other way around? Would you care to explain, Mr. Justice?\nApollo:\nAs you can see, Your Honor, both men had their helmets on in this footage. But it turns out, this is where our base assumptions went astray. We assumed that it was Mr. Starbuck helping Mr. Terran, but it was the other way around. It wasn't Mr. Starbuck helping Mr. Terran at all. It was Mr. Terran who was helping Mr. Starbuck to the boarding lounge!\nJudge:\nI-I-It was whaaaaaaaaaaaat?! Order! Order! Mr. Justice! You mean to tell me that the person on the right in this image is the victim, Clay Terran?\nApollo:\nIt's the only way the riddle of the increasing oxygen level can be solved, Your Honor. At this point in time, the remaining oxygen in the victim's tank was at 50 percent. And when the victim was found in the boarding lounge, his tank was at 0 percent.\nAthena:\nThat's right! There's nothing contradictory about the oxygen level decreasing!\nApollo:\nThis means Mr. Terran was alive as they made their escape to the lounge!\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nHmph. How short your memory is. Have you forgotten what you yourself proposed? Even if the victim was alive at this point in time... ...how did he descend the ladder with his arms full?!\nApollo:\nApollo:\nProsecutor Blackquill, you can't hurt me with a broken blade.\nBlackquill:\nExcuse me?\nApollo:\nIt's true that we don't know how they got down the ladder. I suppose that matter needs further investigating. But we have proven that Mr. Terran was alive when he reached the boarding lounge. This fact alone shatters your claims... ...and opens up the possibility that the victim could've been killed by a third party!\nBlackquill:\nGRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWR!\nApollo:\nThere were two people who claimed to be the first on the scene. But can we truly trust their statements?\nAthena:\nLet's see. The two people were Detective Candice Arme and Yuri Cosmos, right? You think that one of them might have given a false statement to the police?\nApollo:\nYes, it's certainly possible. We might have to do a little more digging.\nJudge:\nIt seems we'll have to hear the testimony of these first two people on the scene.\nApollo:\n(Score!)\nJudge:\nCome to think of it, Detective Arme should be here in court right now. Bailiff, could you please show Detective Arme to the stand?\n???:\nTonate:\nI-I have an announcement, everyone!\nJudge:\nWh-What's the meaning of this? We're in the middle of a trial here!\nTonate:\nP-Please remain calm and listen carefully. Someone has reactivated the bomb! The bomb was defused, but, but, but...... I-It's about to explode! (Changed from [The bomb was diffused, [sic] but, but, but...... I-It's about to explode!] in the original release)\nApollo:\nEX-\nAthena:\nPL-\nJudge:\nOOOOOOOOODE!?\nApollo:\nA bomb? Now?!\nMan:\n-- Aaaagh! Everybody run!\nWoman:\n-- Eeeeek! I don't want to die!\nAthena:\nOh, no! Everybody's panicking!\nBlackquill:\nBlackquill:\nHeadless chickens with a death wish, the lot of you! Calm yourselves afore all else!\nAthena:\nC'mon, Apollo! Let's get out of here!\nApollo:\nBut what about Mr. Starbuck's dream? And who will carry out Clay's final wish? I don't care what happens to me! I'm not letting some bomb blow the truth up forever! I... I... I refuse to let things end here!\nAthena:\nApollo, this is no time to be dramatic! If we don't get out of here now, we're gonna die! C'MON! THIS WAY!\nApollo:\nHey! Ouch! Let me go!\nWoods:\nApollo!\nApollo:\nJ-Juniper? (She hasn't evacuated yet?)\nWoods:\nEeeeek!\nApollo:\nJ-Juniper! Are you all right?!\nAthena:\nApollo! No! Not that way!\nApollo:\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!\nTo be continued\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nApollo:\nApollo:\nConsider the evidence. There's obviously something wrong with that statement!\nBlackquill:\nYour gall knows no bounds. It's shocking, really.\nApollo:\nWhat's that supposed to mean?!\nBlackquill:\nYou stand there, brazenly objecting to perfectly factual statements... One does not see such shameless behavior that often.\nJudge:\nA penalty for our shameless attorney!\nApollo:\n(Oh, no. Looks like Blackquill is turning the judge against me).\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nApollo:\nApollo:\nThat statement clearly contradicts the evidence!\nBlackquill:\n...Hmph. I object to you on personal grounds. The sole contradiction lies in what your faulty logic dreamt up just now.\nApollo:\nAck!\nJudge:\nObjection overruled. The defense will think twice before making such erroneous statements!\nApollo:\n(It seems that statement didn't particularly conflict with the evidence.)\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nApollo:\nApollo:\nThe evidence is at complete odds with the witness's testimony!\nBlackquill:\n...........................Your Baldness.\nJudge:\nWh-Who, me?\nBlackquill:\nWhat do you make of this objection of his?\nJudge:\nOh, I don't know if I should, um, well...\nBlackquill:\nI've no patience for vagaries. Now, answer my question.\nJudge:\nY-Yes, sir! The defense's objection was clearly misguided!\nBlackquill:\nBravo. Nicely done.\nJudge:\nHo ho ho. It seems our misguided attorne has earned himself a penalty.\nApollo:\n(Erk... I better look before I leap next time!)\nConsult (when statements must be pressed)\nAthena:\nHmm... I can't flag any inconsistencies.\nApollo:\nSo there haven't been any contradictions in the testimony so far... That can mean only one thing...\nAthena:\nTime to press the witness!\nApollo:\nRight. We'll have to work to get the testimony we need. Let's press the heck out of any statements that stick out.\nConsult (when evidence must be presented)\nAthena:\nHmm... There has to be a contradiction here somewhere.\nApollo:\n(Too bad I'm drawing a blank.)\nAthena:\nThere was a statement that I thought was a little strange, but... ...I wouldn't bet my life on it.\nApollo:\n.........And which statement would that be? Since I'm the one betting my life on it.\nAthena:\nHee hee hee. Okay, if you must know, I'll show you the one I'm thinking of.\nApollo:\n(Time to swallow my pride and let her lend a hand. There must be an inconsistency in the testimony Athena's pointing out!)\nToo many penalties\nJudge:\nThat's enough! I see no need to further prolong this trial. The defense's case is insufficient to overturn the prosecution's claims! This court finds the defendant, Solomon Starbuck...\nGuilty",

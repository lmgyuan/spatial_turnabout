  "previousContext": "Episode 4\nTurnabout Succession\n...And that is the whole truth of this case. In order to understand it myself... ...I had to know the story of these last seven long years. Nothing happens by chance... All is connected. And now... ..you stand ready to begin the final chapter of this story. Will the defendant be found guilty, or innocent? The decision is yours.\nOctober 7, 10:37 AMWright Anything Agency\nTrucy:\nHey, Apollo! Look, on TV! Look! Look!\nApollo:\nYeah... uh, I'm kinda busy.\nTrucy:\nWhoa! Look at that! He's the last Gramarye, alright! Amazing!\nApollo:\n......\nTrucy:\nApollo, you should be watching this!\nApollo:\nOw ow ow! What? What!? ...I was writing about our last case in my journal.\nTrucy:\nLawyers are supposed to write things in \"records\", Apollo, not journals. And why now? That case was three months ago.\nApollo:\nHey, it's a long story. ...I did a lot, you know. I want to vacuum pack the feel of the moment for later. Right now I'm wowing the crowd by figuring out how Lamiroir disappeared.\nTrucy:\nThat's right! Uncle Valant did that illusion, too! But you're missing him on TV right now!\nApollo:\n*sigh*... I was just getting to the good part. (I suppose I should watch a little TV with her. After all, her father's expecting me to look after her while he's away...)\nAnnouncer:\nWhat you're now seeing is a rehearsal for the greatest magic show on Earth... ...happening right here at our very own Sunshine Coliseum!\nApollo:\nThe Sunshine Coliseum? Hey, that's where the Gavinners concert was!\nAnnouncer:\n...Only three more days until miracles happen here, right before your unbelieving eyes! The legendary Troupe Gramarye is performing for the first time in seven years!\nTrucy:\nThat's going to be great! I'm so there! You and Daddy are coming, too!\nApollo:\n(The legendary Gramaryes... ...If Trucy's real father were still alive... ...he'd be on that stage performing miracles.)\nTrucy:\nI've got the tickets and everything! Here's yours, Apollo.\nMagic Show ticket received.\n...*squeak*...\n???:\nAh, you are here. Working hard or hardly working?\nPhoenix:\nHey! How have you been?\nTrucy:\nHi there, stranger!\nApollo:\n(Not exactly the kind of greeting I'd want to hear from my own kid. Though he has been gone a long time.)\nPhoenix:\nAh ha ha, how goes it, Trucy? Here, I got a present for you.\nTrucy:\nYay! Pudding! I love pudding! Ooh, it's farm-fresh! And not just one pudding, but three whole cups! I'll have to pace myself.\nPhoenix:\nWell, I'm beat.\nTrucy:\nThat's right, Daddy. You're on a top secret mission! You've got to take it easy with the secrets, you know.\nPhoenix:\nAh ha ha. How right you are.\nApollo:\nSo, you still can't tell us what your \"mission\" is?\nPhoenix:\n...... Maybe it is time. It has something to do with you, anyway.\nApollo:\nHuh? With... me?\nTrucy:\nOoh! Maybe you're getting a top secret mission, too! Maybe you can be one of those guys! A spy!\nApollo:\n(Can't I just be a defense attorney...?)\nPhoenix:\nAh ha ha! To be honest... ...telling you about the mission was my whole reason for coming here today.\nApollo:\nWhat...?\nPhoenix:\nTell me... ...you've heard of the Jurist System, yes?\nTrucy:\nThe Jurist System...?\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. The new legal system everyone's talking about.\nTrucy:\nHave you heard of it, Apollo?\nApollo:\nHuh? Uh... Maybe?\nPhoenix:\n...... Maybe not as many people are talking about it as I thought.\nApollo:\n(The \"Jurist System\", huh?)\nAfter clearing \"The Jurist System\" and \"The secret mission\" Talk options:\nApollo:\nSo... what kind of case is the trial simulation about?\nPhoenix:\nWell, since it is the first run through of a new system, I wanted something simple.\nTrucy:\nGood thinking! No sense wearing yourself out on something too serious!\nPhoenix:\nTrue. The case is a murder.\nApollo:\nThat's not simple at all!!\nTrucy:\nBy \"simple\", did you mean that the defendant is...\nPhoenix:\n...Guilty. Yes. Most likely. ...So, good luck, Apollo.\nApollo:\nUm... with what?\nPhoenix:\nWith the trial tomorrow. You're defending, of course. Recall that I said it had something to do with you.\nTrucy:\nGo for it, Apollo! It's just a test case, anyway. No sweat!\nApollo:\nYeah, but there's still a verdict to be decided.\nPhoenix:\n...And a potentially serious sentence. The most serious, in a worst-case scenario.\nApollo:\nAck! You mean... the verdict's for real!? That's not a \"test\" trial! That's a... real trial!\nPhoenix:\nAll the forms have been filed. There's no turning back now. The trial begins tomorrow at 10 AM. Hope you can make room in your schedule.\nApollo:\nWh-Why am I only hearing about this now!?\nPhoenix:\n...Ah, yes. There was a change this morning. ...I picked a new case.\nApollo:\nEh...?\nPhoenix:\n...Something that happened last night.\nAfter clearing \"The trial simulation\" Talk option in Wright Anything Agency:\nOctober 7Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nApollo:\n......\nTrucy:\n......\nApollo:\nThat's 20 minutes we've been waiting here! 20 minutes!\nTrucy:\nMaybe I should complain? I'm sure that guard has better things to do than stand there pretending he doesn't see us.\nApollo:\nYou know the minute we get angry, the client will show. It always works that way.\nTrucy:\nLike shouting, \"Oh, waiter!\" and they're standing right behind you? Oh, guaaaaard! Is our client going to be much longer?\nGuard:\nWhat are you talking about!? Haven't you already started the meeting, yet!?\nTrucy:\n...Huh? Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!\nApollo:\nWh-Wh-Where'd you come from!?\n???:\n......\nApollo:\nW-W-W-Well... ...Anyway! Please have a seat!\n???:\n......\nTrucy:\n...... I'm nervous, Apollo.\nApollo:\nIt's the silence. It builds suspense. Why don't you do something, Trucy? You're a magician, aren't you?\nTrucy:\nTh-That's right. OK...\nMr. Hat:\nI'm the Amazing Mr. Hat!\n???:\n......\n...*thud*...\nTrucy:\nEeeeeeeeek! She passed out!\nApollo:\nHmm. Ms. Magic Underwear might have been a better bet.\nTrucy:\nThat's \"Magic Panties\", Apollo!\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nApollo:\n(Well, that was fruitless. Though I think I understand despair a little better now.)\nTrucy:\nYou did good, Apollo!\n???:\n......\nTrucy:\nL-Look! She's doing her nails!\nApollo:\nWhat? Are nails more important than defense? Is that it!? ...Let's go, Trucy.\n???:\n...Excuse me...\nApollo:\n...!\n???:\nC-Could you... Could you read this?\nApollo:\nUm, sure. (I feel like a teenager on a first date! And this is the love letter we passed from desk to desk at school...)\nTrucy:\nStop looking so wistful and read it, Apollo!\nApollo:\nIt... It's a business card. With a name and an address. The name is... Vera Misham? The address is for \"Drew Studio\".\nVera's Card added to the Court Record.\nApollo:\nAnd you're giving me this card because...?\nVera:\n......\nApollo:\n...... Well, looks like we're finished here.\nTrucy:\nI wonder if Drew Studio is the scene of the crime?\nApollo:\nLet's go find out.\nOctober 7Drew Studio\nApollo:\nWow, this looks like... it looks like a studio.\nTrucy:\nIt's like life imitating art... Or, maybe, it's the other way around... Hmm. But the tape on the ground there... It's a bit jarring...\nApollo:\nYeah... Looks like we found our crime scene...\nTrucy:\nApollo! Look at all those paintings!\nApollo:\nHey, don't touch those.\nTrucy:\nIt's OK, I'm just looking. Huh? Apollo... Look at this one.\nApollo:\n...Looks half finished. (You can still see the rough sketch underneath.)\nTrucy:\nBut, that's odd. The rough part doesn't look like the rest of the painting at all.\nApollo:\nYeah, good point. (That is odd...)\nDrew Misham's Paintings added to the Court Record.\nTrucy:\n...All the paintings have a really different style, too.\n???:\nAh! I thought I might find you two here.\nTrucy:\nEma! Long time no see!\nEma:\nOh? Seems like I run into you far too often. I'll bet I know why you're here, too.\nApollo:\nYou know about the trial simulation tomorrow?\nEma:\nI've heard about it, sure. So Mr. Wright chose you, huh?\nApollo:\nWe don't even know what the case is about.\nEma:\nWell, he was killed. The artist who owns this studio, that is. Mr. Drew Misham.\nTrucy:\nMisham...\nEma:\nAnd his daughter was put under arrest.\nApollo:\nYeah... We just saw her at the detention center.\nTrucy:\nIt was funny, though. She seemed more like a victim than the kind of person who could commit murder.\nEma:\nYou don't say. Not even by poisoning? That's how it was done, you know. Poisoning's a common way to get the job done, when the murderer is a woman.\nTrucy:\nP-Poisoning...?\nEma:\nAnyway, Mr. Wright told me you'd be coming. Feel free to take a look around. I'll just be over here. With my Snackoos.\nApollo:\n(We can't talk to anyone related to the case this time around... ...Which means we'd better find out as much as we can here at the scene. ...Or else.)\nTrucy:\nI thought so.\nEma:\nI'll never forget that face, but what was his name...? Oh, right. Brushel.\nTrucy:\nBrushel...\nEma:\nHe's after a scoop to sell to the papers.\nApollo:\nSo a reporter comes for an interview with a painter. His first interview ever, and that night, he's killed. Seem strange to you?\nTrucy:\nReally strange.\nEma:\nIt does raise a few questions.\nApollo:\nI'd like to speak with this reporter if I could.\nEma:\nWell, I hear he's on the beat today, too. ...He said something about covering a magician.\nApollo:\nMagician...? (Well, if it's not Trucy, that leaves only one other person.)\nTrucy:\nIt wasn't Valant Gramarye, by any chance, was it?\nEma:\nYeah, something like that! He's got some big show lined up, I hear.\nApollo:\n(So, he's out interviewing Valant Gramarye... Looks like I'll be heading out to that coliseum again sooner than I thought.)\nEma:\nHere, I'll give you that reporter's card if you want.\nBrushel's Card added to the Court Record.\nAfter clearing all Talk options in Detention Center - Visitor's Room, then visiting any other location:\nOctober 7Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nGuard:\nAh, you're here to see Vera Misham?\nApollo:\nYes, that's right!\nGuard:\nShe's in the medical office at the moment.\nTrucy:\nMedical office...? Is she OK?\nGuard:\nShe's just lying down. Said she didn't feel so good. I'm sorry but I can't allow any meetings at the moment.\nApollo:\nMost. Annoying. Client. Ever.\nTrucy:\nGuess we should come back.\nAfter clearing \"Valant Gramarye\" Talk option in Wright Anything Agency:\nOctober 7Sunshine Coliseum\nTrucy:\nWoo hoo! This is it, Apollo! The place where magic and dreams converge!\nApollo:\nJust a while ago it was the place where murder and nightmares converged.\nTrucy:\nLet's go say hi to Uncle Valant!\nApollo:\n(What about the case...?)\n???:\nWaaaah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!\nTrucy:\nOnly a performer laughs like that...\nValant:\nThe young Miss Trucy! How often I hoped we'd meet again only to tell myself it was an impossible dream!\nTrucy:\nTee hee, Uncle Valant! How's it going? I'm glad to see you, too!\nValant:\nOf course you are.\nApollo:\n(Humility is definitely NOT one of his stronger traits...)\nValant:\nWell, Miss Trucy, how does the day find you? If you've come to give me flowers, do it after the show, I beg you.\nTrucy:\nActually, we came to wish you good luck! And congratulations on your big magic show!\nValant:\nOh? But it is I who wish to congratulate you! Not everyone is so lucky as to witness miracles such as I shall perform!\nApollo:\n(Yeah, yeah, you're amazing, we get the picture.)\nValant:\nThe world will watch in wonderment as Magnifi's illusions are reborn! Here, on stage! By my hand!\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Gramarye Envelope:\nValant:\nNow, the time has come when I must return to make my prestidigitation preparations! By your leave, Miss Trucy.\nTrucy:\nThanks, Uncle Valant!\nValant:\nThree days from now... make ready for a miracle!\nApollo:\nWhat do you think that journalist was after? And why did Valant react like that to this envelope?\nTrucy:\nI think it's time to pay the detention center another visit.\nOctober 7Detention CenterVisitor's Room\n???:\n...I think I hear what you're saying. \"We're All Doing It For The Money\", end quote.\nGuard:\nNo no no no! Not at all!\nApollo:\n...Looks like someone's already meeting here.\nTrucy:\nMaybe that reporter?\n???:\nHey there! How ya doing? Who might you be?\nApollo:\nAh, sorry, we didn't know someone was already here. I'm Apollo Justice, attorney at law. (Talk about a nervous monkey.)\n???:\nYou? You're Justice!? You?\nApollo:\nYou... know me?\n???:\nDo I know you? Of course I know you! \"Stares Down Witnesses On Stand Till They Spill Beans\", end quote.\nApollo:\nTh-That's not true! (What's he writing...?)\nTrucy:\nAre you a reporter by any chance?\n???:\nWoo! You! You're Trucy!\nTrucy:\nEh? Am I famous?\n???:\nOh yeah. Oh yeah! \"Trucy Wright Hates Carrying A Bag: Puts Everything She Owns In Her Panties\", end quote.\nTrucy:\nEeeeeeeeeeek! That's so not true!\n???:\nJust hold on to your breeches, there. I'll wrap up this interview in a jiffy.\nTrucy:\nInterview...?\n???:\nSo, guard. I think I know what's going on here. \"Guarding Rooms Is My Life. What Else Could I Possibly Need?\" end quote.\nGuard:\nNo! How many times do I have to tell you this? Look, I've got work to do. You deal with him.\nTrucy:\nUm... did you come here to interview the guard?\n???:\nOoh wee, what a pickle! \"Accused Wouldn't Talk, Had To Interview Someone Or Go Plum Crazy\", end quote.\nTrucy:\nHuh...\nApollo:\n...I should've guessed.\n???:\nWhere're my manners!?\nBrushel:\nName's Brushel. Spark Brushel. \"I'm Not Picky -- Journalist Just Closes Eyes, Writes\", end quote.\nApollo:\n(What's that nauseatingly strong mint smell every time he grins?)\nBrushel:\nUntil you've been interviewed by me, you don't know what thrilling is! \"Wild Romp Through Crossroads Of Mayhem, Madness\", end quote.\nApollo:\n...I can see that. (He's writing something again! Well, if he's a reporter, maybe he knows something...)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nBrushel:\nWell, there's nothing I can talk about really. \"Walls Have Ears, Eyes -- Especially Glass Walls With Speakers\", end quote.\nApollo:\nRight. Guess we'll leave then.\nBrushel:\nAh, but since you're here... ...might as well tell you a tidbit of news I saw. Just for the heck of it.\nTrucy:\nSure, tell us! ...Just for the heck of it.\nBrushel:\nI remember it like it was yesterday... ...I'd seen a movie on a trip, and wandered into this burger place with amazing ketchup... ...when an article in a tabloid caught my eye. \"Famous Oil Painting Stolen From Art Dealer's Gallery\", end quote, I believe it was.\nApollo:\nAn oil painting...?\nBrushel:\nHappens every day, right? But, I thought I'd seen that painting somewhere before. ...A painting of a giant peach floating down a river.\nApollo:\n(Someone stole an oil painting... of a giant peach.)\nBrushel:\n\"Journalist Can Smell Scoop Better Than Burgers\", end quote.\nOctober 7Drew Studio\nEma:\nWell, how'd it go? Find anything out?\nApollo:\nActually, there was one thing I wanted to check with you.\nEma:\nWh-What's with that scary face you're making?\nApollo:\n(And what's with the \"I know something but I'm not telling\" face you've got going, Ema?)\nApollo:\nUm, I kind of wanted to see the rough sketch under this painting. And I was wondering if your \"tool\" there might do the trick?\nEma:\nOh, fine. Fine! Just this time, though.\nTrucy:\nLet's check it out!\nEma:\nOK, let's print this one out.\nApollo:\nWhat... What the heck?\nTrucy:\nWow, he really blows! The finished painting isn't anything like the rough!\nEma:\nDevices like mine didn't exist until recently. He probably thought he could draw any sort of thing he wanted to for the rough.\nTrucy:\nWhat do you mean?\nEma:\nWell, in the past, you could only analyze the composition of a rough sketch.\nTrucy:\nComposition?\nEma:\nIn other words, the traces of charcoal between paint and canvas. So you could tell if there had been a rough sketch... ...but not what it looked like.\nApollo:\nAh, I think I follow you. So, in essence, it wouldn't matter what was underneath the finished painting.\nEma:\nSome pros would actually paint out a rough sketch entirely. Then do a completely new painting on top of that.\nTrucy:\nSo Mr. Misham was drawing whatever he wanted before painting over them...?\nEma:\nPossibly. Is there a problem with that?\nApollo:\n(Not particularly... But something about the sketch itself is kind of... odd.)\nTrucy:\nYou're awfully silent all of a sudden, Apollo.\nApollo:\nYou think we could check out one of the other paintings!?\nEma:\nWell, sure. You like this detection stuff, don't you?\nEma:\nOK, let's print this one out.\nApollo:\nThis one, too!\nTrucy:\nWhat's wrong, Apollo? You look so serious all of a sudden!\nApollo:\nUm, you think I could just look at the last of these?\nEma:\nFine by me. Knock yourself out.\nEma:\nOK, let's print this one out.\nApollo:\nWh-Wh... What the heck is all this!?\nEma:\n...I hesitate to ask why you're getting so excited.\nTrucy:\nYou sure your device isn't leaking some kind of strange radiation?\nApollo:\nTrucy! Look at these three sketches! ...Do you notice anything?\nTrucy:\nAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Th-Th-They're...!!\nEma:\nNow you're both white as sheets! What's going on!?\nApollo:\nThese sketches... are of the three cases I worked on!\nEma:\nWhat...?\nApollo:\nThe murder in the poker room at the Borscht Bowl Club! The dead man pulling the noodle stand! And then... ...the events that transpired during the Gavinners concert!\nEma:\n...What could it mean? How could he have painted those things... and why!?\nApollo:\nThat's what I want to know!\nEma:\nWait! Is Drew Misham... ...your father?\nApollo:\nGive me a break! Does that seem even REMOTELY possible to you!?\nApollo:\n(I'd never even heard of any Drew Misham before. I hadn't even seen a picture of him. But there were my cases, drawn on his canvas! ...Every single one of them. It couldn't have been a coincidence. Just who was this Drew Misham... and what did he have to do with me?)\nTo be continued.",

I wouldn't think you could hide such a dark sketch under a little paint.\nApollo:\nWell, it is called \"oil paint\" for a reason. I bet it's pretty oily. The paint I mean.\nTrucy:\nI'm still waiting for you to get to your point.Apollo:\nGood morning!Vera:\n......Trucy:\nSo! You're... Vera, right? I'm Trucy! Trucy Wright! That's \"Wright\" with a \"W\"! Uh, but not \"write\", right?Vera:\n......Trucy:\nUm! We're... on your side! You can tell us anything! ...Please?Vera:\n...... ...Good morning...Apollo:\n...! (She... She speaks!)Trucy:\nHmm, not bad, not bad. But I think you'd do better with a little smile, you know? You're so pretty! You need to sell yourself, you know?Apollo:\nTrucy! Let's... take it easy for starters.Vera:\n...... ...Thank you for taking my case...Trucy:\n...!Apollo:\n(Okaaaaay... Well, that's a start, I guess.)Vera:\n......Apollo:\n(There she goes with the nail polish again...)Trucy:\nThat's great, really! It's so cultured!Vera:\n............ ...Want to try...?Trucy:\nOooooh! Really!?Apollo:\n*sigh* Girls... (The victim, Drew Misham, was a forger. And a stolen painting was found in his studio. A life of crime, really... ...And maybe one that led to his death.)October 8, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:\nWell, we will now... er... *cough* Begin the, er, trial of... Vuh... Vuh... Vuh... Vera Misham!Trucy:\n...Is the judge OK? His voice is all raspy, and he's looking around all nervous-like.Judge:\nErm... ahem. The repercussions of today's trial will, most likely, be felt for a long time. ...And may, indeed, alter our legal system forever.Klavier:\nToday is a test of the Jurist System... ...and the first step toward a new order in our courts.Trucy:\nDaddy's secret mission!Klavier:\nThe jurists will function like a jury. It is hoped their inclusion will help the courts to better reflect the people's will.Apollo:\nWhy... aren't there any jurists in the courtroom?Klavier:\nThree closed-circuit cameras watch this courtroom at all times. The jurists have access to everything that transpires. Jurists! Judge well, and judge cool.Judge:\nN-Now see here, Prosecutor Gavin! I-I was going to say that!Klavier:\nAh, my apologies, Herr Judge.Judge:\nAhem. Jurists! Today, er... Judge today's trial \"coolly\", if you would be so kind!Apollo:\n(The jurists are unbound by the letter of the law. They don't affect the trial with evidence... but by their \"feelings\". And we're about to find out just what effect they're going to have.)Judge:\nVery well, Prosecutor Gavin. The details of the case, if you would.Klavier:\nThe victim is the painter Drew Misham. He was killed in his own studio. His coffee... was poisoned. By whom, you ask? By none other than the defendant, Vera Misham.Apollo:Apollo:\nThere wasn't any poison in the coffee!Klavier:\nAchtung... Someone has been doing their homework! Indeed. Poison was not present in the coffee... but on the mug itself.Judge:\nThe mug...? Ah, residue was found on the rim, I see.Klavier:\nThe autopsy report describes the manner of our victim's death.Judge:\nThe court accepts this as evidence.Misham's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.Judge:\nAccording to this report... ...the victim's death was caused by \"atroquinine\" poisoning.Klavier:\nA chemical compound that does not occur naturally. Lethal dosage is a mere 0.002mg. A touch of atroquinine in the body... ...is the touch of the Reaper's scythe.Judge:\nVery well, Prosecutor Gavin. You may present your witness.Klavier:\nI have for you today a simple man, for a simple case. ...A man who witnessed the murder in its entirety.Apollo:\n(That journalist, no doubt...)Klavier:\nThe witness will state his name and occupation.Brushel:\nAh! Right! Well, for starters, my name's Spark Brushel! My job is... a lone observer of the world!Apollo:\nIn other words, a freelance journalist, right?Brushel:\nAhem! If you don't mind, I'd like to state something here for the record.Judge:\nYes, Mr. Brushel?Brushel:\nI dislike conclusions, specifically, the jumping to aspect of conclusions. \"Preconceptions Make Park Sandbox of Endless Desert Waste...\" end quote.Apollo:\nBut, you are a journalist. You said so yourself yesterday.Brushel:\n...Well, that's true, yes. But you must understand, I stand before you today a man with a dream! I'm offering you my testimony in exchange for exclusive rights to the story! \"Scoop Turns Mr. Brushel Into THAT Mr. Brushel!\" end quote.Judge:\n...Let's hear your testimony then, shall we?Apollo:\n(A \"simple case\", eh, Gavin? For me, the jury... is still out.)Witness Testimony-- The Journalist's Story --Brushel:\nI visited the studio around 9:00 that night to do the interview.\nThe first outsider to enter the atelier! \"Journalistic History Made\", end quote!\nHis daughter brought us coffee right after we started.\nAnd you know what happened next. \"Star Falls!\" end quote.\nNo one else entered the room besides her the whole time.Judge:\nHmm... That does sound like a simple case. Unless... you were the one who poisoned him!Brushel:\nWh-Wh-Wh-Whatareyousaying!? Judge!Judge:\nAhem. Need I remind you, the cameras are rolling today. I felt the need to be a bit dramatic.Klavier:\nYou didn't do it, did you?Brushel:\nM-M-M-M-Medoathinglikethat!? Come on! That's like... \"Newsmaker Making the News\", end quote. Or even \"Contemporary Witch-Hunt\", end quote! I know! \"Wild Accusations Rock Courtroom\", end quote.Klavier:\nAh ha ha ha. Rock, indeed.Trucy:\nProsecutor Gavin sure looks like he's having fun.Apollo:\nI'm so happy for him.Judge:\nVery well, Mr. Justice, your cross-examination, please.Cross Examination",

Isn't that a little late for an interview?\nBrushel:\nIf the great painter Drew Misham says, \"come at 9:00\"... ...believe you me, I go at 9:00! The first, and as it turned out, last interview with such a prolific painter!\nApollo:\nRight. Can you tell us what it was like when you arrived?Brushel:\nThe first outsider to enter the atelier! \"Journalistic History Made\", end quote!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nYou were the first reporter ever in \"Drew Studio\"?\nBrushel:\nPosterity will look back on that night as a turning point in journalistic history! \"A Basically Insignificant Step For All Mankind... But A Giant Step For That Brushel Guy\", end quote.\nKlavier:\nIf no one on the outside ever had access to the studio... ...then it would serve to reason that the deed was done by an \"insider\".\nApollo:\n(...By which he means Vera did it.)\nKlavier:\nSo, how did this epoch-making interview go?Brushel:\nHis daughter brought us coffee right after we started.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\n...Would you mind being a little more specific?\nBrushel:\nOooh wee, let me tell you, I enjoy a cuppa. In fact, it all began when I was in third grade, no wait, fourth grade--\nApollo:\nThat's not what I meant!\nKlavier:\nI believe I know what Herr Forehead is driving at. This coffee the victim was served... Did anyone other than the victim touch it?\nApollo:\nR-Right! That! (That's what I was going to say, really.)\nBrushel:\nWell, now, if you've got a question to ask, you'd best straight up ask it! That's what I tell all the new recruits. Several times, if necessary. \"Write for a grade schooler\", that's my motto. Which isn't to say I can only write grade school-level stuff, mind you--\nApollo:\n...Who touched the coffee!?\nBrushel:\nDunno. I was in the back, looking at the studio's equipment when she served it.\nApollo:\n......\nKlavier:\n...And what happened next?Brushel:\nAnd you know what happened next. \"Star Falls!\" end quote.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nWhat's this about a star falling?\nTrucy:\n\"Star Falls!\" huh... It's like an old telegram! \"Send Money, Over\".\nBrushel:\nZowie! You don't know? That's like a journalism code word. An important personage passes away... a star falls. Get it?\nTrucy:\nBut there's no gravity in space, is there? I wouldn't think stars could fall, really.\nApollo:\n...Does this matter?\nBrushel:\nHoo boy! This is good stuff, good stuff! How about \"Star Breaks\"... Nah... lacks punch. I know, I know! \"Star Dies\". Nah... lacks imagination. Of course, you could go with \"Drew Dies\". Straight, to the point. I like it.\nApollo:\n(I think we need to hear about something a little more substantial...)\n\n\n\nThe moment of death\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nUm, about when Mr. Misham passed away...\nBrushel:\nHoo boy, what a scene that was! He puts his coffee mug down with a crash, right?\nJudge:\nHmm... Yes, and then?\nBrushel:\nThen the cold finger of Death touches his spine! Life's flame sputters and fails! So cold was that touch, he could do naught but tremble uncontrollably! ...Actually \"life's flame\" is a little tired. \"Life's river froze over\"... Yes! That's a go.\nTrucy:\n...I think he's starting his article already.\nApollo:\nCould you describe that a little more simply?\nBrushel:\nWell, as you can imagine, I was pretty surprised. He hit the floor, as they say. \"Artist's Seizure Is Final Performance\", end quote.\nKlavier:\nAtroquinine paralyzes the central nervous system. The body arches back like a bow, the limbs tremble, the throat burns--\nJudge:\nTh-That's quite enough of that! Some of us want to be able to sleep tonight.\nBrushel:\nOh yeah? Well I want details, lots of juicy details!\nKlavier:\nFor that you can listen to our last year's hit single. \"Atroquinine, My Love\", by the Gavinners. Available at all major music outlets.\nJudge:\nThe point here is that the victim died of atroquinine poisoning. Well, Mr. Justice? How did you find that testimony?\n\n\n\nVery important\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nWell, as an account of the moment of the victim's death, I'd say it's very important. ...Please add it to the testimony.\nJudge:\nVery well. The court requests the witness add this account to his testimony.\nChanges statement from \"And you know what happened next. \"Star Falls!\" end quote.\" to \"Those spasms... That was definitely death by poison.\"\n\n\n\n\nNot important\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n(You'd think the moment of Mr. Misham's death would be important... ...But Mr. Brushel's story really didn't tell us anything we didn't already know.)\nJudge:\nVery well, please continue with the testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nBrushel's coffee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nSo, you drank the coffee that Vera served you, too?\nBrushel:\nCourse. \"When someone serves you coffee, you drink it\"... That's what my old boss always used to say. Never did get what he meant by it, though.\nApollo:\nBut you're still alive, which is to say, you didn't die.\nBrushel:\nOf course not! \"No Point Falling Before You're A Star\", end quote.\nApollo:\n...That's not exactly what I was getting at.\nKlavier:\nWhat were you getting at, then? You know the poison was on the rim, not in the coffee.\nBrushel:\nOh yes, yes! There were two cups on the tray she brought. And one of the cups had Drew's signature painted on the side.\nApollo:\n(Hmm. No chance the guest would take that one by mistake, I guess.)\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Justice? Was that testimony important?\n\n\n\nVery important\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nWe're talking about the coffee the witness drank. I'd say that is important!\nJudge:\nVery well, please add that to your testimony, Mr. Brushel.\nChanges statement from \"And you know what happened next. \"Star Falls!\" end quote.\" to \"I drank the coffee, too, but I'm not dead yet!\"\n\n\n\n\nNot important\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n(So Brushel drank the coffee, too... Doesn't look like this is going to lead to much...)\nJudge:\nVery well, please continue with the testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \"star's\" coffee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nYou say Mr. Misham had the coffee, too. But did you actually see him \"drink\" the coffee?\nBrushel:\nCourse! \"He Who Sees It Wins, But He Who Says It Wins Bigger\", end quote. I live in a man-sees-dog-eat-dog-and-writes-about-it world. Yet...\nApollo:\n\"Yet\"?\nBrushel:\nI guess I can't say I \"saw\" him drink it, really. He had one so-called \"sip\", if that. \"Man Puts Lips To Mug, Drinks?\" end quote.\nJudge:\nHmm. That poison is quite virulent, I hear.\nBrushel:\nMy stomach did a so-called \"somersault\". Since I'd gulped down that coffee without so much as a second glance at it. Wait, maybe something's there! Some kind of so-called \"trick\"! Anyone want to venture a guess? For the record?\nApollo:\n(Does this guy have a pause button?)\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Justice? Did you find that testimony valuable?\n\n\n\nVery important\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nThe victim drank his coffee, then immediately fell over?\nBrushel:\nOh yes, yes. You can go to press with that one.\nApollo:\nYour Honor! This is a vital piece of information! Please add it to the testimony.\nJudge:\nVery well. The witness will add this to his testimony.\nBrushel:\nVital! Right!\nChanges statement from \"And you know what happened next. \"Star Falls!\" end quote.\" to \"He had one sip, if that. The next moment, he was on the floor!\"\n\n\n\n\nNot important\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n(The coffee Mr. Misham drank... That has to be important somehow... ...Nah.)\nJudge:\nVery well, please continue with the testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examinationBrushel:\nThose spasms... That was definitely death by poison.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nYou say it was \"definitely death by poison\"... How can you be so sure?\nBrushel:\nHey, look, I'm a journalist. I've seen a lot of things. And I've had more than my share of experiences with so-called \"poisonings\". \"Man Eats Fishy Fish, Goes Bye-Bye\"... end quote.\nApollo:\n(Food poisoning doesn't count. Hmm. Should I get him to talk about something else?)\n\n\n\nNo need\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n(Let's just go with what we have for now.)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nBrushel's coffee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nSo, you drank the coffee that Vera served you, too?\nBrushel:\nCourse. \"When someone serves you coffee, you drink it\"...

You know the poison was on the rim, not in the coffee.\nBrushel:\nOh yes, yes! There were two cups on the tray she brought. And one of the cups had Drew's signature painted on the side.\nApollo:\n(Hmm. No chance the guest would take that one by mistake, I guess.)\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Justice?

That poison is quite virulent, I hear.\nBrushel:\nMy stomach did a so-called \"somersault\". Since I'd gulped down that coffee without so much as a second glance at it. Wait, maybe something's there!

I gulped it down, felt that sweet scorch in my throat!\nApollo:\nBut you say the victim took one sip and fell over. ...And you still kept drinking?\nBrushel:\nCourse! \"Drink your coffee when it's hot, never when it's not\". That's what my old boss used to always say. Never really knew what he meant by it.\nApollo:\n(Hmm.

Sure! I'm sure. Drew Studio isn't a big place, kiddo. I'd know it if someone else had come in!\nApollo:\nWhat if they had been hiding in there from before!?\nKlavier:\n\nKlavier:\nEven if someone had been hiding in the studio... ...they hardly could have poisoned that mug without anyone noticing.\nBrushel:\nYou think I, Spark Brushel, would miss something as obvious as that? Nooooo way.Trucy:\nHe sure makes it sound exciting. I guess that's his job.Apollo:\nThere's only one moment we need to focus on, really.Trucy:\n...The moment when Drew Misham died?Apollo:\nExactly. There has to be something there!Apollo:\nYou know what I have a problem with? A particular property of the poison used, atroquinine.Judge:\nOh? Prosecutor Gavin was quite clear about the poison. A lethal dosage of 0.002mg paralyzes the central nervous system. If you drank that, even you, Mr. Justice, would be reduced to a quivering pile...Apollo:\n(Why are you using me as an example!?) Unfortunately, we weren't told everything. There was a vital omission in Prosecutor Gavin's information!Klavier:\n......Judge:\nAn omission?Apollo:\nAtroquinine is as virulent as he says. But death doesn't come upon ingestion, not immediately. That's because atroquinine is slow-acting!Judge:\nSlow-acting!Brushel:\nWhatwhatwhatwhat!?Apollo:\nAccording to one forensic scientist...Ema:\nIt's one of the most virulent poisons, but is absorbed into the body astonishingly slowly. It takes at least 15 minutes from the time of ingestion for adverse effects to show.Apollo:\nIf we suppose that the moment Mr. Misham sipped the coffee was when he sealed his fate... ...then he would still have had time left to enjoy his last cup of joe!Judge:\nOrder! Order!!! What's the meaning of this!? If what the defense says is correct... ...why, that contradicts the entire testimony we've just heard!Apollo:\nWell, Mr. Brushel? Anything to say... on the record!?Brushel:\nSlow-acting. S-L-O-W A-C-T... It was virulent, alright. Even then, it had already begun digging its claws into the journalist.Trucy:\n...He's working on his scoop.Apollo:\n(*sigh*)Klavier:Klavier:\n...It's \"Brushel\", ja? Herr Brushel... let's take a trip back down memory lane.Brushel:\nHuh?Klavier:\nDid the victim really die the instant he took a sip? Think it over. This is vital.Brushel:\nYou know what I think? I think that was... \"A Not-So-Subliminal Suggestion\"... end quote.Klavier:\nI admit, it does cause a problem if he died when you say he died. ...I would be forced to say auf Wiedersehen to my simple case. And you would be forced to say farewell to your article.Brushel:\nCome again?Klavier:\nYou can't write a story based on conjecture, can you? And as the case drags on, other reporters will pick up the scent. ...And you'll be forced to kiss your exclusive scoop goodbye.Brushel:\nScoop... Scoop... .....................! Look, wait. Just wait a second. Just one second.Judge:\nWe're waiting, we're waiting! Out with it!Brushel:\nI think I just recalled a so-called \"important detail\"! \"A Revival of Recollection\", end quote! \"A Story's Survival\", end quote!Apollo:\n\"Attorney Utterly Confused\", end quote.Brushel:\nActually, I did notice something when I visited the studio. I'd heard of poison that \"takes its sweet time\", see!Klavier:\n...But not what I've been saying for the last few minutes, apparently.Judge:\nMr. Brushel! Are you saying you noticed something that explains what happened!?Brushel:\nYou bet I am! The \"Antidote For A Poisonous Contradiction\", end quote, you might say!Apollo:\nOr \"I Still Have No Idea What You're Talking About\", end quote, I might say.Brushel:\nI figured it out, but only after an in-depth interview! See, thanks to my journalism skills, I know who poisoned that coffee!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order!Klavier:\nAs far as I can tell, the witness is standing by his testimony. ...That Mr. Misham died the instant after he drank.Brushel:\nOf course I'm standing by my testimony! ...And my dream of exclusive rights to this story!Klavier:\n...Ach. I suppose it was too much to hope for.Apollo:\nWhat was?Klavier:\nOf course he wouldn't choose a simple case, not him.Judge:\n\"Him\"...?Klavier:\nPhoenix Wright, who else?Apollo:\n...!Klavier:\nAchtung, Herr Brushel! Report for us, if you would. What is it that you noticed?Brushel:\n......Judge:\nThis court is a critical trial of the Jurist System. I'm afraid no room for doubt is permissible. You will testify to the court about what you noticed!Witness Testimony-- What Brushel Noticed --Brushel:\nWhen I arrived at the studio, Mr. Misham was at his desk.\nHe seemed to be writing a letter... but he quickly sealed the envelope.\nI thought nothing of it at the time, of course.\nNow that I think about it, what if he was writing a suicide note!?Judge:\nHmm... A suicide note?Brushel:\nYes... he had this look on his face. \"Man's Face Inscrutable As A Quadratic Equation\", end quote.Trucy:\nSuicide? Poor Mr. Misham... But that means Vera's innocent!Apollo:\nWould someone commit suicide in the middle of an interview?Trucy:\nOh.Judge:\nVery well, you may begin your cross-examination.Cross Examination",

When he entered the studio on the night of the murder... ...the victim had just finished writing a letter!\nBrushel:\nYeah, I said that. And yeah, it was true.\nApollo:\nFurthermore, you went on to tell us... ...that he put the letter in a yellow envelope and put it in the letter box.\nJudge:\nAh...!\nApollo:\nBut that very same letter box was empty! In other words... ...that night, the \"yellow envelope\" disappeared!\nKlavier:\n\nKlavier:\n...Ah, yes, intriguing. So an envelope has disappeared from the scene of the crime. Of course... this changes nothing.\nApollo:\nHuh...?\nJudge:\nHe has a point, Mr. Justice. What we're trying to figure out here is how the poison got into Mr. Misham. Is it really important that this envelope the witness says he saw disappeared?\nApollo:\nWell, if it did disappear, then something did leave the studio that night. That seems very important to me!\nJudge:\nVery well then. The witness will add this to his testimony.\nBrushel:\nYou got it.\nKlavier:\n...I still think this fails to change anything, Herr Forehead.\nApollo:\n(I wouldn't be so sure. A letter disappeared from the crime scene that night... This is exactly the opening I've been looking for!)\nChanges statement from \"And nothing left that studio after he died. Nothing.\" to \"A letter was put in the post from the studio, but I hardly think that matters.\"Brushel:\nA letter was put in the post from the studio, but I hardly think that matters.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nNothing could be more serious than an envelope disappearing from that studio! And you were hiding that fact from us!\nBrushel:\nEr, yes, well, actually...\nKlavier:\nI don't argue the possibility that a letter disappeared from that studio. ...But Herr Forehead, isn't there a much more serious question before us?\nApollo:\n(...Right, how Mr. Misham was poisoned. I know. But Mr. Brushel's testimony has changed, which means the facts of the case have, too. And what he's told us means something entirely different now, I'm starting to think.)\nTrucy:\nLet's keep thinking, Apollo!Brushel:\n...Clearly, the only one who could have poisoned him was his daughter!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nYou say \"clearly\" as though it were obvious. But this claim that the defendant poisoned the victim is merely conjecture!\nBrushel:\nAh, yes, well, you see... In my business, it's all about making the most ridiculous things sound right. A bad habit, I know.\nJudge:\n......\nKlavier:\n......\nBrushel:\nYes, well, er, actually... ...I guess this is more a case of \"Ridiculous Journalist Sounds Wrong\", end quote.\nJudge:\nThe court is forced to agree with you. Please refrain from wild conjecture.\nBrushel:\nUnderstoodloudandclear!\nApollo:\n(If only I could believe that.)Trucy:\nWhat do you think, Apollo? Everything he's saying seems so... not flawed!Apollo:\n...Well, that's kind of what you want from a testimony, really. (...I need to keep my eye on what matters. How, and why, was Drew Misham, killed? Vera poured the coffee, that's not going to change. But if that coffee didn't kill him, I need to find what did... and prove it!)Apollo:\nProof is... possible. (Here goes nothing...)Klavier:\nYou do understand what we need, ja? Proof, Herr Forehead. Not \"possibilities\".Apollo:\nOf course. And, Prosecutor Gavin, I hope you understand... ...I'm ready to give you that proof.Klavier:\nWh-What did you say?Apollo:\nI have proof of the disappearing envelope!Brushel:\nI saw him writing a letter, I did!Judge:\n...Which was picked up by the mailman, I assume?Apollo:\nOf course, which means... ...that envelope had a stamp on it.Judge:\nA stamp... Ah..................Apollo:\nAs we all know, stamps come with dried glue on the back. In order to use the glue you have to wet it... ...by licking the stamp!Klavier:Klavier:\nFeh. No one worth talking to actually licks stamps in this day and age.Apollo:Apollo:\nEven if you wanted to talk to him, you couldn't. ...He's dead, after all.Klavier:Klavier:\nOK, so he licked the stamp. But wait! How does that explain the atroquinine on the rim of the coffee mug?Apollo:Apollo:\nIf he licked the back of a poisoned stamp, the poison would get on his tongue, yes? What would then happen if he put the coffee mug to his mouth, hmm?Klavier:\n...!Apollo:\nThose traces on the mug weren't the killer's doing! It was the other way around!Judge:\nWhat!?Apollo:\nThe coffee mug didn't poison Mr. Misham... ...Mr. Misham poisoned the coffee mug himself!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! B-But that doesn't... Does it?Apollo:\nRecall, if you would... ...atroquinine is a slow-acting poison, yes? The poison entered his body when he put the stamp on that envelope. But his time wasn't up until the very moment he touched his lips to that cup of joe.Judge:\nYou have something to add, Mr. Brushel?Apollo:\n(Uh oh. His nose is picking up another scent...)Brushel:\nAs I believe I mentioned earlier.Brushel:\nWell, that's the thing, see. After he put his letter in that envelope... ...Mr. Misham sat there searching his desk drawer for something! Yes! A stamp! A so-called \"Postage Stamp\", end quote!Brushel:\nBut you know, I don't seem to remember him ever finding one.Judge:\nMaybe he'd just run out?Klavier:\nIncidentally, we searched the desk drawer at the scene of the crime. There were no stamps. Not a single one.Apollo:\n...!Judge:\nHmm, that does pose a problem. How will you prove that the stamp was coated with poison?Apollo:\nActually, I'm glad no other stamps were found. It makes proving the stamp he used was poisoned possible!Klavier:\nAh ha ha ha ha ha. ...Good show, good show. You can't even prove there was a stamp at the scene in the first place!Judge:\n...Well, let's hear what the defense has to say anyway. Where's your evidence that proves the existence of this poisoned stamp?Present Tiny Frame\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Well, that certainly is a cute little frame. And by little, I mean really little.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nJudge:\n...... Well, Prosecutor Gavin?\nKlavier:\nI think our beloved attorney has been licking too many stamps in his free time.\nApollo:\n(Grr... Do you smile like that when you torture all your victims, or just me?)\nJudge:\nTake care that we don't lick you and stick you in the letter box, Mr. Justice!\nApollo:\n(...I think I'm making this out to be way more complicated than it really is. That stamp would have left a small atroquinine residue on something... But what?)\nLeads back to:\n\"...Well, let's hear what the defense has to say anyway.\"Judge:\nWell, that certainly is a cute little frame. And by little, I mean really little.Apollo:\nIt was on the victim's desk, Your Honor. ...Quite empty, as you can see for yourself.Klavier:\nI noticed that too during my inspection. So what?Apollo:\nAh, apparently you weren't as observant as you should have been. You see, when you saw this frame, it was missing something quite important.Judge:\n\"Missing\" something...?Apollo:\nYes. A pale bluish stain on the inside of the frame... Atroquinine residue!Klavier:\nWhat!? Why wasn't I told about this!?Apollo:\nThe frame is only two inches square. The face of the frame is even smaller. Maybe an inch wide at most.Klavier:\nYou aren't saying...Apollo:\n...Oh, but I am. Tell me: what fits in such a small frame? A commemorative stamp, perhaps?Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order!!! The poisoned stamp was in this frame...!?Klavier:\nImpossible!Judge:\nP-Prosecutor Gavin...!Klavier:\nWhy would he put something like that on his desk? Don't tell me he had it there so he could commit suicide if the mood struck!Brushel:\nYou know, can I say something? I had a thought, see!Judge:\nWhat, Mr. Brushel, and please stop jittering around like that!Brushel:\nThe victim was a forger, right? There's a lot of money in that line of work. \"Forger Forges Friends, Makes Enemies, Too\", end quote.Apollo:\nSo the poisoned stamp might have been a murder weapon, aimed at him!Klavier:Klavier:\n...Oh, rich. That's rich. Leave the ridiculous flights of fancy to the Gavinners's song lyrics, please.Apollo:\n(Finally, something we agree on.)Klavier:\nThe stamp was a \"murder weapon\"? Nonsense! Murder is a simple business. Who would go to such lengths? No one.Apollo:\nOh, I disagree.Klavier:\nC-Come again...?Apollo:\nRecall, if you would, the victim's reclusive lifestyle. Drew Misham hid from the world. He avoided meetings. His only contact with the outside world... was the mail.Judge:\nThe... mail!Apollo:\nNow, if you wanted to kill someone you couldn't meet, but you knew read letters... ...a stamp would be the perfect weapon!Klavier:\nRidiculous! Where's your proof? I want proof! Show us evidence that this poisoned stamp was sent to him... as a murder weapon!Apollo:\n(I might not have \"evidence\" per se... But things are finally starting to come together!)Trucy:\nWh-What is it, Apollo? Your fists are trembling!Apollo:\nI think I know what happened! I don't believe it... but I can see it! I think I know how Mr. Misham was killed!Judge:\nWell, fill us in, Mr. Justice!Apollo:\n...A certain piece of evidence points to the truth, Your Honor. I can show you how someone with the intent to kill sent Mr. Misham the stamp of death!Present Red Envelope\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Isn't this the envelope... the one from seven years ago?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nJudge:\n...... I'm not sure it's entirely clear to me what this proves, Mr. Justice.\nApollo:\nHuh...? (Was I wrong?)\nKlavier:\nI believe we have shown probable \"intent to kill\". Except the killer would be Herr Judge, and the victim, you!\nApollo:\nYeeeeargh!\nJudge:\nConsider that a warning, Mr. Justice. Think before presenting next time.\nApollo:\nYes, Your Honor. (Let's think this one over again.)\nLeads back to:\n\"...A certain piece of evidence points to the truth, Your Honor.\"Judge:\nIsn't this the envelope... the one from seven years ago?Apollo:\nThink about the text of the letter again. There were two pages in the envelope. This is page one. ...And this is page two. I want to draw your attention to one phrase in particular. \"...Send in the enclosed envelope with the enclosed stamp within 3 days.\" The enclosed stamp, Your Honor.Judge:\nAh...!Brushel:\nIn other words, if I have this straight... \"The Stamp! Poison! On The Stamp! Lick, Lick, Gasp...\" end quote!Apollo:\nNow, what if he had done exactly as the letter asked?Trucy:\nHe would sign the document, put it in the envelope... and put the stamp on it, right? Then he would put it in his letter box...!Apollo:\nFifteen minutes wouldn't have elapsed between affixing the stamp, and mailing the letter. But the clock started ticking, and when the time came... he drew his last breath. And the murder weapon would be taken away from the scene.Judge:\n...Quite conveniently, thanks to the postal system!Klavier:\n...Such a splendid imagination you have, Herr Forehead!Apollo:\n......Klavier:\nLet me confirm one thing with you, if I might. So, this \"poisoned stamp\" was inside this envelope from seven years ago... ja? Is that what you'd have us believe? Really?Apollo:\n...W-Well...Trucy:\nIt is a little bit of a stretch, but there's a possibility.Klavier:\nYes. A very small possibility. How small, I wonder?Trucy:\nUm...Klavier:\nA poisoned stamp in this envelope? A stamp that then became the murder weapon? How do you intend to prove this seeming coincidence?Trucy:\nW-Well...Apollo:\n(Ack! It was seven years ago, and we don't even know who sent that letter!)Klavier:\nAnd your answer... is silence, I see. Very well! I move to...???:\n...It's not nice to pick on the Fräulein, Klavier.Klavier:\n...!Apollo:\nAh... Ema!Ema:\nWell? Like my Kristoph Gavin impression? Did I sound like him?Apollo:\n...Don't quit your day job.Klavier:\nDon't you have a crime scene to be looking after, Fräulein Detective?Ema:\nSomeone had to come dig you all out of the mess you're making of this case.Apollo:\nMess...?Ema:\nYou know, none of this would happen if you just trusted in science a little more. You can find out if that stamp was in that envelope, easy.Klavier:\nCare to explain yourself, Fräulein Detective?Ema:\nGlare at me all you want, but science is on my side. It's all in the residue, right?Apollo:\nThat's right! The poison detection spray...Judge:\nProduce the red envelope at once! You can open it on the authority of the court!Spray bottom right of page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Well! Would you look at that!\"Judge:\nWell! Would you look at that!Ema:\nNo mistaking it. That's atroquinine residue!Judge:\nI-I don't believe it... A murder weapon from the past... Now, seven years later, it bares its fangs at last!Klavier:Klavier:\nAbsolutely outrageous! ...Tell me why! Why didn't this murder take place seven years ago!?Apollo:\nWell, um...Ema:\nThere's one possibility. Maybe Mr. Misham figured it out.Judge:\nFigured what out?Ema:\nHe realized that the person who sent that letter wanted him dead. So he sent his reply with a different stamp.Judge:\n...And put his decisive evidence in a frame.???:Brushel:\n......Judge:\nAck! You're still here!?Brushel:\nC-Can I make a statement here, on the record? I, Spark \"Razortooth\" Brushel, claim this scoop as mine! \"Drew Misham Killed In Cold Blood... ...By Sender Of Seven-Year-Old Letter!\" end quote. Hmm, no, maybe something more succinct. \"Star Falls After 7 Year Delay\", end quote.Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! I see no room for further argument here. Though I admit, this is all coming as quite a shock. To think that the murder weapon reached his mouth after seven years...! \"Stamp Is Ticket Straight To Afterlife\", end quote!Trucy:\nUh oh. I think the witness is a bad influence on our judge.Judge:\n...I see no need for further debate on this matter. The sender of that letter seven years ago could hardly have been our defendant!Trucy:\nA-Apollo!Apollo:\nI think we just won!Judge:\n...Very well! This court finds the defendant...Klavier:Klavier:\n...Is this the bright future of our legal system?Judge:\nProsecutor... Gavin?Klavier:\nA ticket to the afterlife from seven years ago...? Tickets for Gavinners's shows are invalid after two weeks.Judge:\nB-But it doesn't make sense any other way!Klavier:\n...It boggles my mind that so many people haven't noticed this. There's a fatal contradiction in Herr Forehead's claim!Apollo:\nA c-contradiction?Klavier:\nA poisoned stamp was placed in this envelope seven years ago. Whereupon it was framed, until now. If that's the case, then why would Drew Misham have done what he did?Apollo:\nE-Ema explained that! He must have realized it was poisoned!Klavier:\n...Therein lies the rub.Apollo:\n...!Klavier:\nSeven years ago, the forger Drew Misham sensed a trap, and put the stamp in a frame. I do not debate this. ...But this begs the question. Why, seven years later, did he use that stamp on the night of the murder?Apollo:\nAh...!Klavier:\nSurely, you don't mean to suggest that Mr. Misham simply \"forgot\"? He put the murder weapon in a frame on his desk for seven years... and forgot? You expect us to believe he sprang the trap on himself?Apollo:\n...... Uh... Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaugh!Judge:\nWhile I admit, this is all quite shocking, myself... ...it does seem highly unlikely that he would fall afoul of a trap... ...that had been sitting on his desk for seven years!Trucy:\nA-Apollo!Apollo:\nI don't think we're winning anymore.Klavier:\nAh, I'm glad to see we're all back in the real world now. Welcome back to reality! We've been waiting for you.Apollo:Apollo:\nOK... Then how do you explain the poisoned stamp that was in this envelope?Klavier:\nThe \"poisoned stamp\"...? Where exactly is this poisoned stamp, again? Have you brought it to court for us?Apollo:\nUh...Klavier:\nI see no proof that such a thing ever existed.Apollo:Apollo:\nWhat about the atroquinine residue, huh!?Klavier:\nOh, I agree, that does seem to be atroquinine residue. But, Herr Forehead, it's certainly no stamp.Apollo:\n...! Y-Yeah, but...Klavier:\nEven if your precious poisoned stamp did exist... ...Drew Misham never would have used it. ...That is all.Apollo:\n...... Urk.Judge:\nI believe we've come to a conclusion. Again.Trucy:\nA-Apollo! Were we wrong the whole time?Apollo:\nI-I can't believe it! The poison traces match up! It can't be coincidence!Judge:\nI'd like to bring some closure to this issue, sometime this year. ...Mr. Justice?Apollo:\n...Yes, Your Honor!Judge:\nLet's review the facts, and see where we stand. Seven years ago, Drew Misham received a red envelope. There were traces of the poison atroquinine on the document inside that envelope. A similar trace was also found at the crime scene... ...on this tiny picture frame. The defense has indicated the possibility of a yellow envelope. An envelope that left the scene of the crime with the poisoned stamp on it.Klavier:\nYes, but even if this envelope contained a poisoned stamp... ...and Drew Misham, knowing this, put it in a frame... ...he never would have used that stamp!Judge:\n...I'm afraid you're right. Which means there is a fatal flaw in the defense's case!Apollo:\n(I haven't been on the wrong track this whole time, I'm sure of it! The traces of atroquinine, the envelope, the frame... ...and Drew Misham's mysterious death... They're all connected somehow!)Judge:\nWell, Mr. Justice, do you have a conclusion for us?Apollo:\n...The defense stands by its case, Your Honor. We've seen that the logical outcome of the evidence makes no sense. Which means that one of our clues... must be a fake.Klavier:\nAh, a fake clue? Fascinating! And if we find this fake, your wild fantasies will prove quite reasonable, ja?Apollo:\nThe fake clue that's thrown us off the poison's trail is none other than...the red envelope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge:\nThis red envelope... is a fake?\nApollo:\n...Without a doubt, Your Honor.\nKlavier:\n\nKlavier:\n...Wasn't it you who presented this evidence to the court?\nApollo:\n...Oh.\nTrucy:\nHold on a second, Apollo! The poison on that envelope, the frame, and the coffee mug... They're all connected somehow!\nApollo:\nOh... right! (*sigh* I can hear it already. \"It looks like the fake... was you, Herr Forehead!\")\nTrucy:\nNow's no time for wallowing in self-pity! Let's get thinking, Apollo!\nLeads back to:\n\"The fake clue that's thrown us off the poison's trail is none other than...\"the frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge:\nThis frame... is the \"fake\" clue?\nApollo:\n...Without a doubt, Your Honor.\nKlavier:\n\nKlavier:\n...Wasn't it you who presented this evidence to the court?\nApollo:\n...Oh.\nTrucy:\nHold on a second, Apollo! The poison on that envelope, the frame, and the coffee mug... They're all connected somehow!\nApollo:\nOh... right! (*sigh* I can hear it already. \"It looks like the fake... was you, Herr Forehead!\")\nTrucy:\nWe can flog ourselves later, Apollo! Now's the time for thinking!\nLeads back to:\n\"The fake clue that's thrown us off the poison's trail is none other than...\"Drew Misham.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Th-the victim was a \"fake clue\"? I'm afraid I don't understand.\"Judge:\nTh-the victim was a \"fake clue\"? I'm afraid I don't understand.Apollo:\n...I'll explain. We have an envelope, a frame, and a mug, linked by poison. That all makes sense. What doesn't make sense is the victim himself!Klavier:Klavier:\n...Congratulations. You've completely lost me. So the fake evidence is none other than the master of fake himself, the forger? ...It makes a good story, I'll give you that.Apollo:\n(The fake clue... Fakes... forgeries...) Ah...!Trucy:\nI know that face! That's the \"I just had an idea\" face!Apollo:\nI don't know if I'm right... but I'm going with it anyway! What if our \"forger\" is the \"fake\"!?Klavier:\n...Come again?Apollo:\nSeven years ago, our forger sniffed a trap, and stepped aside. ...Seven years passed. Now the forger stumbles into that very same trap, and dies. ...Why?Judge:\nThat's what I want to know!Apollo:\nBecause the forger who was killed... was a fake.Klavier:\nHere we are again. The victim... was a \"fake\"?Apollo:\nOne forger smelled the trap. One forger fell into the trap. That's two forgers! And one of them was a fake!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order!!!Klavier:\nSo you are telling us that Drew Misham, the victim, was a fake? Well, if he was the fake, who was the real forger? You'd better not be claiming there was some kind of switcheroo?Judge:\n...I'm afraid you're going to have to back up your story. Mr. Justice. Show us just who the real Drew Misham was!Apollo:\n(If Drew Misham wasn't the real forger... ...there's only one other person it could have been!) ...Understood, Your Honor. Forger Drew Misham was himself a forgery! The real forger was...!Present Vera Misham profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"There can be only one explanation, really.\"Present anyone else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nJudge:\n......\nKlavier:\n......\nBrushel:\n......\nApollo:\n(Ack! \"Attorney Makes Wild Claim, Becomes Subject Of Mass Ridicule\"... end quote! Better come up with something quick before that story goes to print...!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Forger Drew Misham was himself a forgery!\"Apollo:\nThere can be only one explanation, really. The real identity of the forger known as Drew Misham is none other than... ...his only daughter, Vera Misham!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! ...Mr. Justice! This is going out on a limb, even for you!Trucy:\nI kinda agree. I mean, Vera, a forger?Apollo:\nLet's consider it before you write it off entirely. If you look at the paintings in the studio, one fact becomes quite clear. Forgery had been taking place in that studio for quite some time! The forger wasn't caught in that trap seven years ago. This can only mean that the one who was caught in the trap wasn't the forger!Judge:\nWell... Actually, that does make a certain kind of sense.Apollo:\nOne more thing! Only two sets of fingerprints were found in the forger's studio. Drew Misham's... and Vera Misham's.Klavier:\n......Apollo:\nIf we know that Drew Misham wasn't the forger... ...that leaves only one possibility, by process of elimination. The forger was Vera Misham. ...Well?Klavier:\n...... ...Fascinating!Judge:\nVera Misham...?Vera:\n......Judge:\nYou've been paying attention to the trial so far?Vera:\n......Klavier:\nLet's just ask her and be done with it, shall we? Who are you? Who is the forger, Drew Misham?Vera:\n...... ...! ......Apollo:\n(Was that... an expression of emotion I saw on her face? She's staring holes into Prosecutor Gavin's face...)Klavier:\n...I'm used to being stared at by Fräuleins, believe me. Though they usually talk to me, too. Tell us. Were you the one who forged those works of art?Vera:\n...... ...Yes...Apollo:\n...!Judge:\nSo... so the forger, Drew Misham was... you!?Vera:\n...... ...Yes, it was me...Judge:\nWha... Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?Apollo:\n(The court was in an uproar, and it wasn't coming down. We had to break for a ten minute recess.)To be continued.October 8, 1:24 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 6Trucy:\nOK... So where exactly does this leave us, Apollo?Apollo:\nWell, the Drew Misham who was killed... ...wasn't \"Drew Misham the forger\", basically.Trucy:\nHuh? Well then, who was he?Apollo:\nWell \"he\" was actually...Vera:\n......Apollo:\n(...Doing her nails.) So, you really made those forgeries?Vera:\n...... ...Yes... For Father... ...I know it was wrong...Trucy:\nCould you tell us how it happened?Vera:\n...... ...My father was a painter... ...I love painting ever since I was a child... ...One day, Father saw it in me... ...He saw that I had the \"talent\"...Trucy:\nThe talent... for making forgeries?Vera:\n...How should I say it? It was not only paintings I made... ...Given the materials, I could make... anything...Apollo:\nAnything...?Vera:\n...Father was so proud, and I, so happy... ...But, in the end, I was making... those...Apollo:\n...Forgeries.Vera:\n...I've never had a good constitution, nor... personality... ...I know very little of the world outside my door... ...... ...Now, because of me... Father... is...Trucy:\n...Do you know about this red envelope?Vera:\n...I remember that envelope. It was some time ago...Apollo:\nSo, you were already a, um... You were already creating your \"works\" back then?Vera:\n...I started when I was only twelve years old...Apollo:\nSo the one who figured out the stamp was poisoned, that was...Bailiff:\n...Mr. Justice! It's time! To the courtroom, please!Apollo:\nR-Right! (Out of time...)Trucy:\nWait, Vera! Just one more thing, please! Those three paintings in the studio...Vera:\n...I painted those, as part of my work...Trucy:\nRight. See, we checked them out and we saw what was underneath. We saw the rough sketches underneath the three finished paintings...Vera:\n...I see... ...... ...Mr. Justice...Apollo:\n...Yes!?Vera:\n...Father... He knew of you... ...Of both of you...Apollo:\nYour late father...?Vera:\n...He was watching, gathering information... ...All about the \"Wright & Co. Law Offices\"...Trucy:\nB-But lately, we're not doing just law...!Vera:\n...Yes... You do tricks, gags to amuse... and play piano...Trucy:\nWell, they're not really \"gags\"...Vera:\n...Yet when Father heard you had resumed the legal business... ...How pleased he was...Trucy:\n...Who was Mr. Misham?Apollo:\n...How'm I supposed to know?Trucy:\nWhat if he was Daddy's Daddy?Apollo:\nJudging from the relative ages involved, I'd say it's highly unlikely. (Things are already confusing enough with all these daddies running around. We know that the victim's daughter, Vera, was the forger. What does this mean for the case...? Guess we're about to find out.)October 8, 1:36 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom, No. 3Judge:\nCourt is now back in session.Vera:\n......Apollo:\n(Vera seems pretty tense. She's practically chewing her fingernails clean off!)Klavier:\nPerhaps you could begin by telling us how it all worked. How did you set up this \"Drew Misham forger\" persona?Vera:\n...... ......Apollo:\n(There's that stare again... She's drilling more holes into his head.)Trucy:\nI know it's hard for you, but hey, he's a handsome guy.Apollo:\nWhat's \"hard\"!?Judge:\nVery well, miss, if you would... ...did you really make those detestable forgeries...?Vera:\n...!Klavier:\nPerhaps you'd rather answer my question? Were you the one who painted that painting. The remarkably similar one?Vera:\n...Ah... Yes... ...I painted it, yes... ...Father praised me quite highly for it...Judge:\nSo... she was the one who made the forgeries.Klavier:\nYet, she did not wish to reveal the truth of their operation. So the victim was a stand-in, a decoy. To the world at large, he was the forger, not her.Vera:\n...... ...I've done... a bad thing. I have, haven't I...?Klavier:\nRegardless, we need a little more information. About, for instance... ...this!Apollo:\n...!Klavier:\n...You have seen this before, ja?Vera:\n...Y-Yes...

I'll even throw that time machine you cherish so much overboard with you!\nBride:\nPlease, take me back... back to that blissful moment...!\nBridesmaid:\nIt's almost time for the reception, m'lady.\nBride:\nIt actually... really worked...!\nSeptember 21, 10:13 AMWright Anything Agency\nAthena:\nOkay, lemme make sure I've got this straight. When your magic panties appear... ...I do a backflip into a handstand, then blow out the candle...?\nTrucy:\nNo, no, Athena, you've got it all wrong! You do a backflip through the ring of fire, while holding the candle in your mouth!\nAthena:\nUh... There's no way I'll ever be able to do that.\nTrucy:\nSure you can! I believe in you, Athena!\nPhoenix:\nTrucy, what are you and Athena up to?\nTrucy:\nAthena's agreed to be a part-time performer in my magic show!\nAthena:\nI couldn't say no to some extra cash, but I probably should've thought it through first... Now it's \"human cannonball this,\" \"guillotine that\"... It's not like I have nine lives, y'know!\nPhoenix:\nYou've made your bed, Athena. Now you've got to lie in it.\nAthena:\nNooo... I'm too young to be taking out a life insurance policy already!\nPhoenix:\nMy name is Phoenix Wright. I'm the head of this law office.\nTrucy:\nAnd since when did you become the head of this office, Daddy? I mean, who exactly does all the cleaning, accounting, and scheduling around here, huh?\nPhoenix:\nHa ha ha. You've got me there, Trucy. This is Trucy Wright. She's my adopted daughter, and a magician.\nAthena:\nAnd I'm Athena Cykes. The rising star lawyer of the Wright Anything Agency!\nPhoenix:\nOr rather, the rising star assistant to Trucy, you mean.\nAthena:\nIf I don't get back in a courtroom soon, I'm going to forget everything I ever learned...\nPhoenix:\n(Speaking of the courtroom... we haven't exactly had any clients lately, have we?)\n???:\nBusiness is as slow as ever, huh, Nick? Bet you made more money back when you played the piano.\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nLarry:\nYo! Long time no see!\nPhoenix:\n......L-L-Larryyyyyyy?! I-I haven't seen you in years! What brings you here, all of a sudden...?\nLarry:\n..........Some big news, that's what.\nPhoenix:\nUm, okay...\nAthena:\nWho's this guy, Boss?\nPhoenix:\nThis is Larry Butz. He's, um... Well, let's just say he's an old friend of mine. So, Larry, what's so big that you had to come and tell me in person?\nLarry:\n...There's somebody I want you to meet. Hey, you can come in now!\n???:\n...All right. How do you do?\nPhoenix:\nUh, hi...?\nTrucy:\nTh-That dress! Is that... a wedding dress?!\nEllen:\nYes, it is. My name is Ellen Wyatt. I'm a domestic servant -- a maid of the Sprocket household.\nAthena:\n\"Sprocket\"...? As in \"Sprocket Aviation\"?\nEllen:\nYes, that's the one.\nAthena:\nWow, Mr. Wright! Sprocket Aviation is a really big airline company! You've heard of Rainbull Airlines, right? The one they call \"RAL\" for short?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, that does sound familiar.\nAthena:\nWell, it's run by Sprocket Aviation.\nPhoenix:\nI see... But what is a Sprocket family maid doing here in a wedding dress?\nLarry:\nSo, actually... we've decided to get married.\nPhoenix:\nYou what?\nLarry:\nI'm not so young anymore, ya know? I figured it's time to finally settle down.\nPhoenix:\nWHAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Y-You're... getting married?! (No way. I don't believe it. Besides...)\nEllen:\n............\nPhoenix:\n(Why would someone as well put together as her choose someone as flakey as Larry...?) Y-You're kidding, right?\nLarry:\nJealous? I don't blame ya, but green's really not your color, you know?\nPhoenix:\n......*sigh* All right, Larry. Lay it on me.\nExamine\nBookshelf\nPhoenix:\n(This office might look messy... ...but at least I keep all of my clients' personal info safe under lock and key. That's what a successful man does, right? Puts his efforts where they count!)\nCharley the plant\nPhoenix:\n(Charley looks as lush and green as ever... ...thanks to Athena taking such good care of him. I guess I should pitch in every once in a while, too, huh...)\nHula hoop\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe I should tidy this place up every once in a while. Still, I bet we're going to use all this stuff sometime soon again anyway... So it's probably better just to leave things where they are.)\nMagic props\nPhoenix:\n(I haven't played this old thing in a long time... Not that I could ever play it to begin with... And considering all the complaints I'd get, I guess I'd better just continue to not play it...)\nMagic split box\nPhoenix:\n(I bet we're the only office in existence that uses magic props as furniture. At this rate... ...Trucy's props are going to wind up taking over the whole office. I mean, they're already halfway there...)\nTable\nPhoenix:\n(Apollo's jacket, Athena's notes... ...and Trucy's magic props. Not that I'm complaining... It's nice to know my friends and family are always close by.)\nTalk\nYou're getting married?\nPhoenix:\nIn all seriousness, Larry, are you really getting married?\nLarry:\nNot right away, but that's the plan. We're gonna elope, see -- like, love on the run, I guess you could say! Isn't that right, Elly?\nEllen:\n............ ........................ ............Larry. I do believe there's been a major misunderstanding here. My heart already belongs to another.\nLarry:\n...Hm?\nEllen:\nI'm in love with Sorin... ...not you!\nLarry:\nS-Say whuuuuuuuuuut?!\nPhoenix:\n(......That's about what I thought.)\nLarry:\nB-But, Elly, baby! W-Weren't you running away with me so we could get married?!\nEllen:\nAs I said, you misunderstand! You said you'd help me escape. That's the only reason I ran away with you!\nLarry:\n...U-UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! This is NOT happening! I even shook off the police for you... And for WHAT?! That's it! If we can't be together, my life is over! I'm gonna end it all!\nPhoenix:\nWait, back up... Did you say you shook off the police?\nLarry:\nYes! We HAD to, 'cause we're lovers on the lam!\nPhoenix:\n...Sorry, Ms. Wyatt, but can you maybe fill me in on what's going on?\nEllen:\nTo tell the truth, I'm being pursued by the police as a murder suspect.\nPhoenix:\nM-Murder? They think you killed somebody?\nEllen:\nI happened to find a dead body at my reception, so the suspicion fell onto me. They had me confined in a separate room... ...and that's when Larry came along and helped me escape.\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm sorry, but what...?\nLarry:\nOhhh, Nick! Me and Elly were going to elope -- we were gonna put it all on the line for true love! But the police tried to stop us, so we had to scramble to shake 'em off! Where did it all go wrooooooooooong?!\nPhoenix:\n......I feel a migraine coming on.\nEllen:\nPlease help me! The police are sure to be intensifying their search...! Look! It's even on TV!\nTV:\nMore news on the murder suspect and an unidentified man on the run from the police. A photo of the suspect, Ms. Ellen Wyatt, has just been released by the police. Sources say that the 21-year-old is suspected of clubbing the victim... ...25-year-old Dumas Gloomsbury, to death in the wedding reception hall after her banquet. The two fugitives are said to be highly agitated and dangerous. If you see them...\nPhoenix:\nYou've got to be kidding me...\nAthena:\nOh, brother...\nTrucy:\nI guess this means we're technically harboring a pair of fugitives here, huh?\nLarry:\n*sniffle* Oh, Nick! What's a guy to do?! Elly's dumped me hardcore!\nPhoenix:\nI'M the one who should be crying!\nLarry\nPhoenix:\nI haven't seen you in ages. Where have you been all this time?\nLarry:\nYou mean you don't know? You've really gotta stop living under a rock and get out more. I'm the hippest, hottest picture book author in the business -- Laurice Deauxnim! I can't believe you didn't know that I'm taking the picture book world by storm!\nTrucy:\nOh! But I know you! You're the one who wrote \"Franzy's Whippity-Whip Trip,\" right?!\nPhoenix:\nNow that you mention it, I think I did hear something about a one-hit wonder...\nLarry:\nO-One-hit wonder?! What the heck, Nick! I'll have you know I just created a BRAND NEW character, to moderate acclaim! He's mildly popular with 18 to 24-year-old women everywhere! Look! You can see his cute self all over this jacket!\nPhoenix:\nWhat? That heart-shaped pork chop?\nLarry:\nHe's not a pork chop! He's the main character of my latest picture book! A lovable little soul who pierces the hearts of lovers with his arrows of amore -- Cupiglet! And you can see this adorable fellow make his debut in... \"Cupiglet's Lovey-Dovey Lark\"! In stores now!\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure...? Because I've never seen that book \"in stores,\" now or ever...\nLarry:\nWell, if you ever do see it, do me a favor and buy a copy or ten, will ya?\nPhoenix:\n(But I thought you were \"taking the picture book world by storm\"...?)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nLarry:\nWh-What are you showing me your attorney's badge for? Wait, are you saying you want me to take up your badge and hit the courtroom?!\nPhoenix:\nA-Absolutely not. With you as the defense, you're liable to bring the whole courthouse down. Literally.\nLarry:\nAll I want is ONE chance to defend somebody in court...! OBJECTION! How was that? Pretty good, huh? ...Ready to let me borrow your badge now? You saw how awesome I am at pointing, right? I'm starting to think I'm a natural!\nPhoenix:\nI'm not lending you my badge, and that's final. Besides, pointing isn't all that a lawyer does!\nLarry:\nAww! Pretty please?! Whaddya got to lose?\nPhoenix:\nMy reputation, for one! (I never should've shown him my badge.)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nLarry:\nAnywho, you'll defend Elly in court, right, buddy?\nEllen:\nPlease! I'm begging you! I didn't murder anyone! I swear I'm as clean and pure as this pure-white dress!\nPhoenix:\n(No Psyche-Locks. I guess that means she's telling the truth. But helping a fugitive on the run? What am I getting myself into?)\nEllen:\n......There's... actually one more thing I really need to tell you.\nPhoenix:\nOh?\nEllen:\nYou might find this hard to believe, but... ...the truth is... ...I'm a time traveler.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? I-I'm not sure I follow.\nEllen:\nAfter the wedding reception, I was... attacked... I was moments away from my death... But then, in that instant, I made a wish upon this pendant around my neck... ...and I went back in time to just before the reception started.\nPhoenix:\n...............\nEllen:\nOnly, this time around, the man who was trying to kill me was already dead. And... somehow, I became the suspect for his murder. It's as if... history had been rewritten.\nPhoenix:\n...N-Now, wait just a minute here. I don't understand. Are you saying tha--\n*wooooooo*\nPhoenix:\nWh-What's going on?!\nAthena:\nM-Mr. Wright! There are police cars outside! And not just one or two, but a whole bunch!\n*wooooooo*\nTrucy:\nDaddy! A whole squad of officers has the building surrounded!\nPhoenix:\nWhaaaaaaaaaaat?!\nPoliceman:\nThis is the police! There is no escape! Drop your weapons and come out with your hands up!\nLarry:\nEeeeeeeeee! Nick, what do we doooooooooo?!\nPhoenix:\nHeck if I know!\nAthena:\nI see a bunch of armed officers out there... One, two, three... ...forty-four, forty-five. Wow. Talk about overkill...\nPoliceman:\nListen here, you criminals! Think about what you're putting your poor parents through. I'm sure this isn't how they raised you! Think about their smiling faces, and their warm, home-cooked meals! Ack! Who in the heck are you...? A detective?! N-Now, hold on there! H-Hey! You can't go in there! It's too dangerous! WAIIIT!\n???:\nIs everyone okay in here, Mr. Wright?!\nPhoenix:\nE-Ema?\nEma:\nI'm sorry for all the commotion.\nPhoenix:\n......Um, so, what in the world is going on?\nEma:\nWell, I raced on over as soon as I heard that it was Mr. Butz who'd holed himself up in here... ...with the murder suspect after he made off with her.\nPhoenix:\nAnd the fleet of patrol cars?\nEma:\nThe police are being extra careful... ...because apparently, a certain somebody yelled out... \"Stay back! I have a bomb!\" I'm sure you can guess who I'm talking about.\nLarry:\nWell, the police were being so persistent, I had to do something! So I tried bluffing! You know, like you do in court, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nPlease leave me out of this...\nEma:\nWell, Mr. Wright, I'm bringing this young lady in for questioning. So if you want to talk to her, you'll have to do it down at the detention center.\nPhoenix:\n*sigh* I suppose I should thank you for your thoughtful gift of trouble and mayhem, Larry.\nLarry:\nC'mon, Nick! We gotta get down to the detention center right away!\nPhoenix:\nListen, Larry... I haven't even decided whether I'm going to take on this case or not.\nLarry:\nBut I know you will! 'Cause it's you!\nAthena:\nGuess I've got no choice but to tag along and help, then!\nTrucy:\nWhat? And skip out on me?! We've only just started practicing your repertoire, you know!\nAthena:\nHuh?\nPhoenix:\nYou'd better stay and practice with Trucy, Athena. A promise is a promise, after all.\nAthena:\nThat's cold, Boss! You've gotta get me out of this! I can't take it anymore!\nTrucy:\nLet's get practicing, Athena! Next up is some training for the water tank escape trick! Stick your head in this bucket of water and hold your breath for fifteen minutes!\nAthena:\nEep...! Noooooooooooo! Stop! I'm begging you!\nTrucy:\nAh! She's getting away! You get back here, Athenaaaa!\nPhoenix:\nHa ha ha. I guess the only person cut out to be Trucy's assistant is Apollo. Well, guess we'd better get to the detention center and ask Ms. Wyatt some questions. Especially about that whole \"time traveling\" business she was talking about.\nSeptember 21Detention Center - Visitor's Room\nEllen:\n......Oh! It's you, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nMs. Wyatt, would you mind if I asked you a few questions?\nLarry:\nNick is gonna defend you, Elly! Isn't that great?\nPhoenix:\nL-Larry! I told you I haven't decided yet...\nEllen:\nWh... Wh... Wh... WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Y-You're not going to... take my case? *sniffle* WAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! I'm NEVER gonna be happyyyyyyy!\nPhoenix:\nM-Ms. Wyatt?! (What the--?! Did I do something wrong?!)\nEllen:\nWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!\nPhoenix:\nM-Ms. Wyatt, please calm down!\nEllen:\nI'm innocent, I tell you! *sniffle* But the police won't believe me! And neither will anyone else! I'm gonna die all alone in a jail ceeeeeell!\nPhoenix:\nA-All right, all right! I'll do it! I'll take your case -- just please stop crying!\nEllen:\n*sniffle* R-Really...? You will?\nPhoenix:\nThe fact that Larry was the one who brought you to me had me a little worried, but... ...you don't seem like a killer to me.\nEllen:\nOH, THANG YEWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!\nLarry:\nThanks, Nick! I knew you'd come through!\nPhoenix:\nDid I really have a choice?\nLarry:\nI guess not, heh heh.\nPhoenix:\n(In any case, it doesn't seem like Ms. Wyatt killed anybody. Plus, it's not like I'm up to my ears in work at the moment.) Ms. Wyatt... Ellen, let's do this -- together!\nEllen:\nWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Oh, THANK you, Mr. Wriiiiiiight!\nPhoenix:\nThere, there. It's going to be okay. Now, try to pull yourself together.\nEllen:\nA-All right. Just give me a moment... I'm truly grateful to you for taking on my defense, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nS-Sure. No problem. (Wow, she literally pulled herself together...)\nExamine\nCamera\nPhoenix:\n(That camera... What is it pointed at anyway? If they're trying to film the defendant, shouldn't it be pointed more this way?)\nGuard\nPhoenix:\n(Look at that guard... He's standing right in that camera's blind spot. From that position, I bet he could even doze off and get away with it.)\nMicrophone\nPhoenix:\n(This mic has been here for a long time. It looks pretty worn out. But this little guy has made thousands of conversations possible... ...so I'd probably end up feeling kinda sad if they just up and replaced it.)\nTalk\nSuspicion of murder\nPhoenix:\nEllen, please tell me everything you can about the incident.\nEllen:\n...All right. It happened after the wedding reception... I... was attacked... ...by Mr. Gloomsbury.\nPhoenix:\n(Wasn't \"Gloomsbury\" the name of the victim in that news report? Maybe I should listen to what she has to say first, though, before I start asking questions.)\nLarry:\nHow dare that guy lay a hand on somebody else's blushing bride! What a creep!\nPhoenix:\n...That's rich, coming from you. Do you have any idea why he'd attack you?\nEllen:\nNo... But...\nPhoenix:\nBut what?\nEllen:\nWell, to tell the truth... ...Mr. Gloomsbury didn't seem very happy about me getting married.\nLarry:\nGeez, jealous much?! What a loser!\nEllen:\nMr. Gloomsbury had forced me onto the vista deck, and was going to push me off... Oh, how frightening it all was! I was just about to lose my life -- on what should have been the happiest day of my life! So that's why I... ...I made a wish upon this pendant.\nPhoenix:\nThat pendant?\nEllen:\nYes, it was a gift from my husband-to-be, Sorin. He said it's a symbol of our love.\nPhoenix:\nAnd so you made a wish on it?\nEllen:\nNow, you may think that what I'm about to say is very strange, but... I begged the pendant, \"Please, take me back... back to that blissful moment...!\" And do you know what? It worked! It brought me back to just before the reception started!\nPhoenix:\n...Um, so that's the \"time traveling\" thing you mentioned back at my office? I'm sorry, but I have to say... it's pretty unbelievable...\nEllen:\nU-UNBELIEVABLEEEEEE?! I-I KNEW you'd never believe meeeeeee...\nLarry:\nNick, Elly here is an honest-to-goodness time traveler! Don't you believe your own client?! The magic of that pendant sent her back in time before the creep could kill her!\nPhoenix:\nAha ha ha. Sure, Larry, sure.\nEllen:\nBut it's really true, I tell you! This pendant is an important part of the time machine Sorin made. I begged it for help, and it really DID send me back in time!\nPhoenix:\n(I-Is she listening to herself...?)\nEllen:\nI even experienced the reception again, even though we'd already held it once before. And during it, everyone there acted as if nothing unusual was happening at all!\nPhoenix:\n(Umm... Could you not cook while we're talking, please...?) All right. So when and how did you come under suspicion for murder?\nEllen:\nWell, after the reception ended -- the second reception, I mean... ...I went back to the reception hall and started cleaning up the place by myself...\nPhoenix:\nH-Hold on. Cleaning? Why were you cleaning on your own wedding day?\nEllen:\nFor my last task as a servant of the Sprocket household... ...I offered to take on the preparation and cleanup of the reception banquet.\nPhoenix:\nI-I see...\nEllen:\nI started to move one of the decorative lanterns in the room... ...but it was so heavy I lost control of it, causing it to topple over and break open. That's when I saw... Mr. Gloomsbury's dead body inside the lantern...!\nPhoenix:\nSo you simply happened to be the first to discover the body, right?\nEllen:\nThat's right! I just came across it by accident! But I became confused, and didn't know what to do. That's when some of my in-laws saw me... and jumped to the conclusion that I had killed him.\nPhoenix:\n(So this Gloomsbury guy tried to kill Ellen... ...but then wound up dead himself after Ellen traveled back in time...? A time machine and a magic pendant... How could any of this be possible?)\nEllen's Pendant added to the Court Record.\nLarry:\nElly, why don't you tell Nick about that other thing, too? About that shadowy figure you saw when you were being attacked?\nEllen:\nYes, good idea, Larry.\nSuspicion of murder (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nEllen, please tell me everything you can about the incident.\nEllen:\n...All right. It happened after the wedding reception... I... was attacked... ...by Mr. Gloomsbury.\nPhoenix:\n(Wasn't \"Gloomsbury\" the name of the victim in that news report? Maybe I should listen to what she has to say first, though, before I start asking questions.)\nLarry:\nHow dare that guy lay a hand on somebody else's blushing bride!

A time machine and a magic pendant... How could any of this be possible?)\nThe wedding\nPhoenix:\nSo you and Larry here were never planning on getting married, right?\nEllen:\nThat's right. We've only had a few brief interactions, so I can't say I know him at all.\nLarry:\nOh, Elly! How can you say that?! You and me are bound by fate, I'm telling ya! We're meant to be together!\nEllen:\nWH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Y-You're wrong, Larry! *sniffle*\nLarry:\nI've never been so right, baby! It's as plain as the goatee on my chin!\nPhoenix:\nLarry, don't make me send you to time out. Now, can you tell me about the groom, Ellen? What's he like?\nEllen:\nHis name is Sorin Sprocket. Oh, he's the most wonderful man! He is, truly, my destiny.\nPhoenix:\nDid you say \"Sorin Sprocket\"? As in...?\nEllen:\nThat's right. The next president of Sprocket Aviation.\nPhoenix:\nWait, he's in line to take over the company?\nLarry:\nHmph! He's nothing but a rich, spoiled brat! I'm clearly the better choice. Clearly!\nEllen:\nLarry, you and Sorin are as different as night and day. There is no comparison.\nLarry:\nEllyyyy, you're breaking my achy-breaky heart!\nPhoenix:\n(So she's marrying into money, huh?)\nEllen:\nI can't believe Sorin chose me, a simple house servant. He's my knight in shining armor, my prince... *sigh* Oh, my Sorin...\nThe shadowy figure (appears after \"Suspicion of murder\")\nPhoenix:\nSo what's this shadowy figure you saw, Ellen?\nEllen:\nIt was... It was when Mr. Gloomsbury was attacking me... Right after I made a wish upon this pendant, I started to pass out... ...but just then, just as I lost consciousness... ...I saw somebody strike Mr. Gloomsbury from behind.\nPhoenix:\nY-You did?! Then that person... ...must be the true culprit! Did you see who it was?\nEllen:\nI-I'm afraid not...\nPhoenix:\nHave you told anybody else about this?\nEllen:\nI told some of my in-laws, but nobody took me seriously. They said it was all just a dream.\nPhoenix:\n(I can't exactly say I blame them... I mean, time travel...?) .........Larry, for my peace of mind, please tell me that figure wasn't you.\nLarry:\nOf course it wasn't!\nEllen's Statement added to the Court Record.\nThe shadowy figure (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nSo what's this shadowy figure you saw, Ellen?\nEllen:\nIt was... It was when Mr. Gloomsbury was attacking me... Right after I made a wish upon this pendant, I started to pass out... ...but just then, just as I lost consciousness... ...I saw somebody strike Mr. Gloomsbury from behind.\nPhoenix:\nY-You did?!

I mean, time travel...?) .........Larry, for my peace of mind, please tell me that figure wasn't you.\nLarry:\nOf course it wasn't!\nPresent\nEllen's Pendant\nEllen:\nOoooooh...\nPhoenix:\nWh-What's wrong?\nEllen:\nI just remembered our reception... We were supposed to be so happy together! Oh, where did it all go wrong...?\nPhoenix:\n(I can't blame her for being upset.)\nEllen:\nWhy did this have to happen to me? UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!\nPhoenix:\nE-Ellen! Please try to calm down! Okay?!\nEllen:\nA-All right...\nPhoenix:\n(Well, she stopped crying, but... ...how can I ask her about anything when she's still so clearly distraught?)\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nWhat can you tell me about this?\nEllen:\nOh, never mind that! What about Sorin? Oh, Sorin... Do you suppose he hates me now?\nPhoenix:\nI-I really couldn't say...\nEllen:\nOooooh... What if... What if...  What if he doesn't love me anymore because of all this...? Whatever shall I...? *sniffle*\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, no! She's going to start crying again!) I really don't think he hates you, Ellen!\nEllen:\nY-You don't? Really?\nPhoenix:\nYes, really! (...Probably?) So don't cry. You'll only cause him more heartache if you do.\nEllen:\nY-Yes. Yes, you're right. As a Sprocket bride, I have to hold my head up high at all times!\nPhoenix:\n(I'd better really watch what I say around Ellen...)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I've asked her all I can for now.)\nEllen:\nSpick and span! Spick and span!\nPhoenix:\nUm, Ellen? What are you doing?\nEllen:\nI want to make everything clean and beautiful for when Sorin comes! I can't have my future hubby come into a dirty room, now can I? It has to be spotless, just like this white dress! Spick and span! Spick and span!\nPhoenix:\nLet's hope we can wipe away all suspicion from you soon, too.\nLarry:\nNick, we'd better get to the crime scene right away!\nPhoenix:\nWhat, you're coming, too?\nLarry:\nOf course I am! If I solve the crime and reveal the true killer with my super sleuthing skills... ...Elly might change her mind about me, ya know?\nPhoenix:\nYou never get the message, do you, Larry?\nLarry:\nNext stop: the mooring dock in Sprocket Park. C'mon, Nick! Let's go!\nSeptember 21Sprocket Park - Mooring Dock\nPhoenix:\nSo this is Sprocket Park... but where's the reception hall?\nLarry:\nThe reception hall? Oh, that's... ......Wow! Looky there!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What? What is it?\nLarry:\nI just spotted me a cute mamacita! Don't wait up, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nHold on! Where's the reception hall?!\nLarry:\nSorry, Nick! A man's gotta stop and smell the roses when they appear! I am an artist, after all! Oh, miiiiss! Yoooooooo hooooooooo!\nPhoenix:\nArgh. I thought he was going to take me to the crime scene! Ah, well. I'm sure he'll come slinking back when he inevitably gets rejected. I'll just take a quick look around until then.\nExamine\nTower\nPhoenix:\n(Wow, that huge airship is moored to just this skinny little tower. I know it's tied down and all, but it still looks like a good breeze could send it flying...)\nBench\nPhoenix:\n(So this bench hit that sign, huh? Hopefully, it didn't hit a person, too! That would be a catastrophe. I guess from now on, whenever I'm walking around outside... ...I'd better be on the lookout for unidentified flying furniture, too.)\nAirship\nPhoenix:\nWow, that airship is huge! (Oops. Didn't mean to say that out loud. I've only seen airships like this up in the sky. But I've gotta say, they're mighty impressive when you can see them up-close like this!)\nSign\nPhoenix:\n(Wow. This thing's really banged up.)\nYouth:\nYou looking at the sign? They say it got damaged by heavy winds yesterday. A big gust sent that bench flying into it. Well, that's what they're saying, anyway.\nPhoenix:\nI-I see... (The wind caused that?! More like a tornado!)\nYouth:\nThe repair guy was saying, \"Don't touch. It's dangerous!\"\nPhoenix:\nI see. Thanks for the heads up. (Poor guy... Looks like it was a lot of work.)\nMove\nPhoenix:\n(Argh, that Larry! I guess I'll just keep looking around here until he gets back.)\nAfter examining airship and sign:\nLarry:\nHey, sorry about that.\nPhoenix:\nI actually thought you'd be back sooner. Didn't work out, huh?\nLarry:\nLay off, man! I wasn't on my game today!\nPhoenix:\nSo now that you're done, would you mind telling me where the reception hall is already?\nLarry:\nWhaddaya mean? It's right there in front of you.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Right in front of...? Wait. What's that say? \"Flying Chapel\"...? Do you mean to tell me...?\nLarry:\nYup! Elly's reception was on that airship!\nPhoenix:\nWhoa! A sky-high reception hall?!\nLarry:\nYep, and that's where you'll find the crime scene. Man, not only does that airship fly through the sky, but the space-time continuum, too!\nPhoenix:\nBut the happy couple's honeymoon got left far behind when it made that time skip, though.\nLarry:\nHere, check the airship out for yourself with this pamphlet.\nFlying Chapel Pamphlet added to the Court Record.\nLarry:\nBy the way, I figured you could use some backup, so I called in some help for you.\nPhoenix:\nYou did?\nLarry:\nYup. Should be here any minute now...\n*vroom*\nPhoenix:\nTh-That red sports car! Larry, don't tell me you called...\nLarry:\nYou know it, buddy!\n???:\nI trust you've been well, Wright?\nPhoenix:\n!\nMaya:\nSurprise! Now, admit it -- that was a pretty good Mr. Edgeworth impression, wasn't it?\nPhoenix:\nM-Maya! What are you doing here?\nMaya:\nLarry called me up! He said something about it finally being time for him to \"tie the ol' knot.\" But that's funny... I'm pretty sure he mentioned something about being here with his bride...\nLarry:\n............ Maya! I know this is sudden, but... please marry meeeeeee!\nMaya:\n............ N-Nick, what's Larry talking about?!\nPhoenix:\nHe was dumped by his bride. Well, by his imaginary bride, anyway.\nMaya:\n......Wow... Poor Larry. That's a new low, even for him. ......But, hey! Imaginary girlfriends never hurt anyone, right? More power to him!\nPhoenix:\nThis is Maya Fey. She's been abroad for her training as a spirit medium. But now that her training is over, she's back home here in the States.\nMaya:\nThat's right! The new-and-improved Maya Fey is on the scene... ...spirit and girl power at the ready!\nLarry:\nHeh, look at you, Maya -- all grown up and as cute as ever! Ooh! You know what? I just realized something! If I ever got married, I'd miss out on all the fun of always meeting somebody new!\n???:\nHmph. I see you haven't changed a bit, Larry.\nPhoenix:\nE-Edgeworth! I figured that car belonged to you! But when did you become Maya's chauffeur?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's nothing like that. I just happened to run into her en route, and picked her up. And by \"run into her,\" I mean she jumped out in front of my car. I nearly ran her down.\nPhoenix:\n(This is Miles Edgeworth. He's a friend of mine, and the district's chief prosecutor. I heard he's been busy lately...) So what brings you here? Wait... Don't tell me Larry called you up, too?\nEdgeworth:\nHe did. However, I have business of my own here at the crime scene.\nPhoenix:\nBusiness? What kind of business?\nExamine\nMiles Edgeworth's car\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe that Edgeworth's still driving around in that bright red car. Maybe it's time he pimped it out by slapping a cravat on its hood or something.)\nTalk\nThe incident\nEdgeworth:\nJust so you know, Wright, I am the lead prosecutor on this case.\nPhoenix:\nWhat?! You?!\nEdgeworth:\nYes. It appears we'll be standing on opposite ends of the battlefield this time around.\nPhoenix:\n(So I'll be up against Edgeworth tomorrow...)  ......But I don't get it, Edgeworth. What about this case warrants the personal attention of the district's chief prosecutor?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's a bit... complicated, to say the least.\nPhoenix:\nIn what way?\nEdgeworth:\nThe groom is a member of the Sprockets, a family with immense influence. If his bride were to stand trial in court, it would sully the Sprocket name. So they tried to apply some pressure on the Prosecutor's Office.\nPhoenix:\n...Pressure to settle it amicably, right?\nMaya:\nWhat do you mean, \"settle it amicably\"?\nPhoenix:\nIt means that they're trying to sweep this whole thing under the rug.\nMaya:\nWow. Sprocket Aviation really has that much clout?!\nEdgeworth:\nYes. They have especially strong ties in both the political and the judicial worlds... ...to the point where no one dares to oppose them.\nPhoenix:\nDon't tell me that includes you...\nEdgeworth:\nDon't be ridiculous, Wright. It's quite the opposite. The Prosecutor's Office is filled with cowards, as I found out. Every last one of my subordinates was loath to prosecute a Sprocket.\nMaya:\nSo that's why you decided to take on the case yourself, right?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's right. I will personally see to it that justice is served. I always prosecute to the utmost of my abilities, regardless of who I'm up against. For that is a part of my creed. Nothing and no one can sway me from that -- not even the almighty Sprockets.\nPhoenix:\nR-Right...\nEdgeworth:\nIf they think they can use their influence to bend the truth... ...they have another thing coming.\nPhoenix:\nYou know, I almost feel sorry for them. They were only trying to protect their interests... ...but all they got instead was you.\nLarry:\nEdgey! C'mon, man! How can you prosecute my poor, sweet Elly? What kind of heartless jerk are you?!\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. I'm simply doing my job. And I'm warning you, Wright. I won't hold back, not for you or anyone else.\nPhoenix:\n(Thanks for the warning, Your Righteousness.)\nEdgeworth\nPhoenix:\nSo, how's it going, Mr. Chief Prosecutor? Busy as always, I presume?\nEdgeworth:\nOf course. Unlike SOMEBODY who has too few clients and too much time on his hands.\nPhoenix:\nHuh, guess that explains why your brow is more furrowed than the last time I saw you. Maybe you should learn to relax a little, Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. Nice try, Wright. But as always... ...I have no intention of showing anyone any mercy... ...including you.\nPhoenix:\n(As inflexible as ever, I see.)\nEdgeworth:\nBesides, I think I've mellowed out a bit with age. So if anything, those furrows should have smoothed out a little as well.\nPhoenix:\n......Honestly, Edgeworth, are you really that blind to yourself?\nEdgeworth:\nE-Excuse me?!\nMaya:\nHe's really self-conscious about those lines, isn't he?\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nEdgeworth:\nThere doesn't seem to be any rust on that badge... ...but can the same be said of its owner?\nPhoenix:\nOf course! I'm practically rust-proof.\nEdgeworth:\nHeh. Let's hope you stay that way.\nEllen's Pendant\nEdgeworth:\nSo the suspect is claiming that she made a wish on that pendant... ...and was transported back in time.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah...\nEdgeworth:\nHah! Of all the ridiculous things in this world! And you actually believe this fantastic story of hers?\nPhoenix:\nUmm... W-Well, I, uh...\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. You should drop this case if you can't bring yourself to believe in your own client's words. Not that I can blame you for your skepticism, mind you.\nPhoenix:\nNnngh... (I may not have a good answer for him right now, but if I just do my job... ...I'm sure the truth will make itself known in the end!)\nEllen's Statement\nEdgeworth:\nAlready started your investigation, I see. I suppose I should praise your enthusiasm.\nPhoenix:\nYou don't need to patronize me, Edgeworth... Just because you're chief prosecutor doesn't make you better than me.\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. My title is my title. But when I see a lawyer from some tiny, obscure office hard at work... ...it's only natural that I should want to do my part to help the socially impoverished.\nPhoenix:\n(Nnrgh... Well, you can help by providing me with some info!)\nFlying Chapel Pamphlet\nEdgeworth:\nA flying wedding chapel... That's a rather romantic venue, isn't it?\nPhoenix:\n\"Romantic\"?  I never thought I'd hear THAT word come out of your mouth. Are you feeling okay there?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat? Am I not allowed to think such a thing?\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait. You're not thinking about finally settling down and getting married, are you?\nEdgeworth:\nWhy do you always have to jump to such extreme conclusions? For your information, I have no intention of doing such a thing... What about you, Wright?\nPhoenix:\nNo plans here for now, even if I wanted to... (Well, at least I found out how Edgeworth feels about marriage. Not that it has anything to do with the case...)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth, about this incident...\nEdgeworth:\nDon't forget, Wright: I'm the prosecutor for this case. Need I remind you that I'm not in the habit of sharing information with my \"adversaries\"?\nPhoenix:\nN-No... (I guess we ARE \"adversaries\" for now...)\nEdgeworth:\nAnd you, Larry.\nLarry:\nM-Me?\nEdgeworth:\nI'd like you to come with me. You have a lot to answer for after that little stunt you pulled with the suspect.\nLarry:\nBut, Edgey! We're old pals, aren't we?!\nEdgeworth:\nPersonal appeals won't work on me, Larry. Now, come along!\nLarry:\nWaaaaah! Niiiick! Help me out heeeere!\n*vroom*\nMaya:\nIs it just me, or is Mr. Edgeworth as relentless as ever?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I guess some things never change. So much for \"mellowing out.\"\nMaya:\nWell, Nick, we'd better hop to it, too!\nPhoenix:\nHop to what?\nMaya:\nInvestigating the crime scene, of course! What else? It's been a long time since you and I teamed up like this! This is going to be fun!\nPhoenix:\nF-Fun, huh? (It HAS been a long time, though... since we were last together like this...) All right. To the crime scene, then!\nMaya:\nYeah! And awaaay we go!\nExamine\nAirship\nMaya:\nIt's not every day you get to see an airship up close like this. So I'm pretty psyched for this!\nPhoenix:\nMe, too... if it wasn't for the fact that it's the scene of a murder...\nMaya:\nOh, right... I almost forgot about that part...\nSign\nMaya:\nWow. That sign really got smashed up.\nPhoenix:\nThere were some really high winds yesterday. And they say that that bench was blown right into the sign.\nMaya:\nWow! I wish I could've seen that!\nPhoenix:\nIf you'd been there, you would've gotten blown away by the wind too, you know.\nMaya:\nThat sounds kind of fun, actually! Don't tell me you never tried to use an umbrella to fly when you were a kid?\nPhoenix:\n...I think I'll take \"staying alive\" over \"fun,\" thank you very much.\nTalk\nAny ideas?\nPhoenix:\nMight as well just jump right in, I guess. So, what do you think?\nMaya:\nWell, let's see. I think... the inside of Mr. Edgeworth's car smelled heavenly!\nPhoenix:\nN-No, no. Apart from Edgeworth's car. I mean, do you have any ideas about this case?\nMaya:\nHmm... Sorry, I can't think of a thing... But what are we wasting all this time with thinking for? There's investigating to be done! Ooh, I can't wait to see what kind of evidence we'll find!\nPhoenix:\nY-You seem really excited.\nMaya:\nYou bet, Nick! The dynamic duo is back in the saddle again! Let's go round 'em up, pardner!\nPhoenix:\nHa ha. All right, let's get to it, then.\nWhat to do\nPhoenix:\nSo what do you think we should do, Maya?\nMaya:\nIsn't it obvious? We start by investigating every single place that has anything to do with the case... ...and then grill every single person involved!\nPhoenix:\n(Her enthusiasm is kind of overwhelming...)\nMaya:\nNow, go forth, Phoenix Wright! Search out the truth! ...Well, don't just stand there! Say something!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, ma'am...?\nMaya:\nLouder!\nPhoenix:\nY-YES, MA'AM!\nMaya:\nThat's more like it!\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nMaya:\nYour attorney's badge looks so nice and shiny on your lapel! It's so cool -- like the mark of a true hero!\nPhoenix:\nIf I can be a hero to my clients, that's good enough for me.\nMaya:\nIn that case, I'll be the commander that controls the hero from behind the scenes!\nPhoenix:\nWait, are you saying you've been manipulating me all this time?\nMaya:\nGo, RoboWright! To the crime scene!\nPhoenix:\n(I guess that makes me a RoboLawyer...?)\nEllen's Pendant\nMaya:\nWhoa! What a beautiful pendant!\nPhoenix:\nIt belongs to Ellen.\nMaya:\nI love its design of a gear with a rose in the center. I wonder if it has any special meaning?\nPhoenix:\n\"May the gears of our love keep on turning\"... ...or something like that, maybe?\nMaya:\nDo you think their love will get in gear once we solve this case?\nPhoenix:\nI sure hope so.\nFlying Chapel Pamphlet\nMaya:\nAn aerial wedding... sounds so amazing!\nPhoenix:\nIt sure would make for the memory of a lifetime. (But I bet this wasn't the kind of memory poor Ellen hoped to make...)\nMaya:\nYou gotta wonder, though...\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nMaya:\nAfter the wedding, do you think the couple gets to ride the airship to their honeymoon?! That would sure make things a breeze!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, I guess it would...\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you think about this?\nMaya:\nIt looks suspicious, but also, not. It could really go either way, I suppose.\nPhoenix:\nWell, what if you had to come down on one side or the other?\nMaya:\nThen I guess I'd have to say... it's probably neither.\nPhoenix:\n(Thanks for the non-answer, Maya.)\nWright Anything Agency\nExamine\nBookshelf\nMaya:\nThese are all your case files, right?\nPhoenix:\nYes, and there's private information on my clients in there, too... ...so no snooping.\nMaya:\nHm? What's this? \"Perfecting Teleportation Magic\"?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? (Trucy must've swapped out my files for her magic books!)\nCharley the plant\nMaya:\nIt's Charley! His branches are as handsome as ever.\nPhoenix:\nCharley seems happy to see you, too, Maya. His leaves are greener than usual today.\nMaya:\nWell, he looks super healthy!\nPhoenix:\nWe always make sure he's watered and well-cared for. (And by \"we,\" I mean Athena and Trucy.)\nHula hoop\nMaya:\nOoh! There's all kinds of interesting stuff here! Like this hoop!\nPhoenix:\nHa ha. Maya, that's not a hoop for hula hooping, you know. It's a--\nMaya:\nA hoop used for levitation magic, right?\nPhoenix:\nNngh! (How did she know?!)\nMagic props\nMaya:\nCome to think of it, you used to be a pianist, right, Nick? So play something for me!\nPhoenix:\nI'm not really good enough to play in front of other people...\nMaya:\n...Can I play, then?\nPhoenix:\nNo way! We'll get complaints from the hotel next door.\nMaya:\nNo fair! It's just a glorified shelf if nobody plays it, you know!\nMagic split box\nMaya:\nWhoa! It's one of those Zig Zag cabinets for dividing a person into three! I've never seen one in real life before!\nPhoenix:\nIt's one of Trucy's magic props.\nMaya:\nOoh! Let's try it out!\nPhoenix:\nI don't know... It's probably dangerous to get in that thing if you don't know how it works.\nMaya:\nAw, come on, Nick! Just hurry up and get in there already!\nPhoenix:\nWhy am I the one on the chopping block here?!\nTable\nMaya:\nSo, are you thinking about a new look, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nWhat are you talking about?\nMaya:\nThat red jacket.\nPhoenix:\nOh. That's Apollo's.\nMaya:\nHmm... Maybe you should wear a little red every once in a while... But... Hmm... It's not really your color, is it? Then again, you never wear anything but blue... so why not give it a try! Here you go, Nick! Put it on!\nPhoenix:\nUm, like I said, it's not even mine...\nSeptember 21Flying Chapel - Reception Hall\nPhoenix:\nSo this is the reception hall...\nMaya:\nAccording to the pamphlet, we're right here!\nPhoenix:\n(Yikes. We're pretty high up... But at least we're indoors, so it doesn't seem so bad.)\nMaya:\nOh, look, Nick! It's Ema! Hey, Ema! Over here!\nEma:\nMr. Wright, Maya. Does this mean you've taken the case?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, that's how things kinda turned out. So do you mind if we take a look around?\nEma:\nBe my guest. We've pretty much wrapped up our investigation, so go right ahead.\nPhoenix:\n(Now's a good chance to find out more about the case from Ema, too.)\nExamine\nModel hot-air balloon\nPhoenix:\nIt's a hot-air balloon -- a symbol of humanity's ambition to take to the skies... It's kind of a romantic notion, don't you think?\nMaya:\nYeah! But I just noticed that it doesn't seem to be tied up to the ceiling all that well...\nPhoenix:\nI'm sure it's fine... (Please don't let it fall on my head...)\nModel plane\nPhoenix:\nA model airplane, the perfect decoration for an airline company wedding.\nMaya:\nAnd a propeller plane like this lends the room a great, old-timey feel! Ooh, I'd love to see the Steel Samurai fly a plane like this! Can you picture it? The Steel Samurai, zipping through the clouds over Neo Olde Tokyo?!\nPhoenix:\nIf Sprocket Aviation ever becomes a sponsor of the show, I could see it happening.\nMaya:\nWhy didn't I think of that?! I think I'll go suggest the idea to them later!\nPhoenix:\nP-Please at least wait until after the trial is over...\nWallet\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like... a business card wallet. I wonder whose it is.\nMaya:\nThat face looks awfully familiar...\nPhoenix:\nYes. Yes it does... (Guess I'll bring it to him later.)\nBusiness Card Wallet added to the Court Record.\nIntact Pegabull lantern\nPhoenix:\nWow, look at the horns on this flying bovine! He must be a bull. It seems he made it through the ceremony in one piece.\nMaya:\nBy the look of those wheels, I bet he can be rolled around rather easily, too.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I bet it would be quite a hassle if you had to lift and carry him everywhere. And this is what the backside looks like.\nMaya:\nWhat's that by the bottom of his tail? A wheel handle?\nPhoenix:\nOh, I get it. This way they can get inside to change the light bulbs.\nMaya:\nI see they left the wheel handle on the inside unpainted.\nPhoenix:\nI guess they figured nobody will see it, so why bother. It makes sense to cut costs where you can. Well, overall... ...I can't say I see anything strange about this thing.\nPartition below model hot-air balloon\nMaya:\nI wonder what this partition is for?\nPhoenix:\nI imagine people like the reception staff or entertainers use it. They probably wait behind it when they're on standby.\nMaya:\nI see... With a partition this size, I bet they could even fit an elephant back there!\nPhoenix:\n... Not that anyone sane would.\nPartition below model plane\nPhoenix:\nThat's one big partition screen. Industrial size, even.\nMaya:\nI bet it'd cause an industrial-sized mess if it fell over!\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's why you're not allowed to touch it, Maya.\nMaya:\nWhat?! Then who's going to test how stable it is?!\nPhoenix:\nJust leave it alone... please?\nFog machine below model plane\nPhoenix:\nIt's a fog machine for the reception.\nMaya:\nPretty cool, huh!\nPhoenix:\nDon't you dare touch it!\nMaya:\nAww. Spoilsport.\nPhoenix:\nThat's because I know how you operate.\nFog machine below model hot-air balloon\nPhoenix:\nIt's a fog machine. I wonder if they used it during the reception.\nMaya:\nOoh! ...Hey, Nick. Go stand over there for a sec.\nPhoenix:\nUm, why...?\nMaya:\nJust because! Now, go!\nPhoenix:\nA-All right... (I've got a bad feeling about this...)\nMaya:\nFog-Master 9000... ON!\nPhoenix:\nMaya, noooooo! ............Huh?\nMaya:\nAww, nothing happened.\nPhoenix:\nLooks like it won't work without some dry ice.\nMaya:\nDarn it. All I wanted to do was surround you in a thick cloud of smoke...\nPhoenix:\n*sigh*\nFog Machine added to the Court Record.\nFog machine below model hot-air balloon (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nIt's a fog machine. I wonder if they used it during the reception.\nMaya:\nOoh! ...Hey, Nick. Go stand over there for a sec.\nPhoenix:\nUm, why...?\nMaya:\nJust because! Now, go!\nPhoenix:\nA-All right... (I've got a bad feeling about this...)\nMaya:\nFog-Master 9000... ON!\nPhoenix:\nMaya, noooooo! ............Huh?\nMaya:\nAww, nothing happened.\nPhoenix:\nLooks like it won't work without some dry ice.\nMaya:\nDarn it. All I wanted to do was surround you in a thick cloud of smoke...\nPhoenix:\n*sigh*\nDoors\nMaya:\nGet a load of that huge set of doors! I bet all sorts of things come and go through there! Like an elephant!\nPhoenix:\nI'm pretty sure it's just the bride and groom... (This is a banquet hall, not a circus...)\nSweetheart area of reception hall\nWindows\nPhoenix:\nSo that's the vista deck out there.\nMaya:\nI bet the view is amazing! But I guess it must also kinda freak you out, huh, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, kind of. (Mostly because there's no surviving a fall from way up here...)\nSweetheart table\nPhoenix:\nThis is the sweetheart table where the bride and groom sit.\nMaya:\nWhere they gorge themselves on the wedding feast, you mean! I'd be too nervous to eat in front of a bunch of guests like this, though.\nPhoenix:\nThey say that newlyweds are usually really busy during the reception, you know. They have to greet and talk with all the guests that came to give their blessings. They don't actually get all that much time to enjoy their dinner.\nMaya:\nAww... I wouldn't be able to stand that... I can't imagine having a huge feast right in front of me and not being able to eat it!\nPhoenix:\nThey say brides tend to have an especially hard time because of their wedding dresses. With those tight corsets squeezing their waists, they can barely eat a bite.\nMaya:\nReally...? It sounds like wedding receptions are absolute torture...\nPhoenix:\n(I guess food still wins out over romance in Maya's book.)\nSmaller table\nPhoenix:\nThis must be where the time machine was placed.\nMaya:\nI can't believe that such a beautiful memento was used for murder! It's just awful! Nick! We have to prove Ellen's innocence, no matter what it takes!\nPhoenix:\nI agree! We can't let this go down as the saddest flying wedding reception in history.\nBroken Pegabull lantern\nPhoenix:\nThis must be the lantern the body was found in. Ellen managed to move it quite a ways. It looks like... a cow, but it's pretty badly broken.\nMaya:\nThat's not a cow, Nick. That's Pegasus, the flying horse.\nPhoenix:\nNo way. It's definitely a cow. It's got horns and everything.\nMaya:\nBut look, it has wings! Cows don't have wings! So it's Pegasus, I tell you!\nPhoenix:\nHmm...\nMaya:\nOh, I know! That pamphlet should tell us! Let's see... Apparently, it's called a \"Pegamoo.\"\nPhoenix:\nI-I did not see that coming.\nMaya:\nYet somehow, the name really captures the essence of what this creature is, you know? ...Huh, that's strange.\nPhoenix:\nWhat is?\nMaya:\nWell, this Pegamoo is definitely a male \"Pegabull,\" right?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I'd say so, what with the horns and all.\nMaya:\nOkay, well... That Pegamoo over there is also a Pegabull. But take a look at the pamphlet. See? The one on the right says \"Pegabull,\" but...\nPhoenix:\nThe other one says \"Pegacow\" -- a female Pegamoo.\nMaya:\nRight. The pamphlet goes on to say how they have Pegamoos for the happy couple.\nPhoenix:\nSo for Ellen's ceremony, there should have been a male and female pair of Pegamoos... ...but, for some reason, there are two males here.\nMaya:\nMaybe somebody made a mistake when they were setting up the room?\nPhoenix:\nIt's hard to believe a fancy place like this would make that kind of blunder, though...\nBroken Lantern added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nIn any case, we'd better check this thing out.\nBloody valve\nPhoenix:\nDid this come from the lantern...?\nMaya:\nIck. It's covered in blood.\nPhoenix:\nMaybe it got on there when the killer was putting the body in the lantern?\nMaya:\nCan you imagine going to open a door and finding the knob covered with blood...?\nPhoenix:\nThat'd be... bloody awful, to say the least.\nBody outline\nPhoenix:\nSo this is where the body was found... And the first person to find it was... Ellen. Ema, what can you tell me about the condition of the body when it was found?\nEma:\nLet's see... The victim was apparently hit on the back of the head. Here's a photo of the scene as we found it.\nPhoto of Victim added to the Court Record.\nBody outline (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nSo this is where the body was found... And the first person to find it was... Ellen. Ema, what can you tell me about the condition of the body when it was found?\nEma:\nLet's see... The victim was apparently hit on the back of the head. Here's a photo of the scene as we found it.\nPetal\nPhoenix:\nHmm, what do you think this is, Maya?\nMaya:\nIt looks like a flower petal to me.\nPhoenix:\nWhat an unusual shape for a flower petal.\nMaya:\nDo you suppose it's from one of the flowers here in the reception hall?\nPhoenix:\nNo, I don't see a single flower like this at any of the tables. I wonder where it came from?\nNote\nPhoenix:\nHey, what's this?\nMaya:\nOoh, let me take a look! \"Grab Ellen when convenient, then send her off from the vista deck.\" ............\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like a note outlining the murder plot...\nMaya:\nWhoever wrote it has better handwriting than me, but it looks like they wrote it in a rush.\nPhoenix:\nAnd why do you say that?\nMaya:\nBecause the writing is only smudged starting from the middle of each line. That happens when a right-handed person with a slight hook writes in a hurry. I do it sometimes myself when I'm not paying attention to where my hand is on the page.\nPhoenix:\nGuess I'll take your word on that, Ms. Bad Handwriting Expert.\nMaya:\nHey! Even I don't smudge my handwriting this badly!\nPhoenix:\nAll right, all right. Let's get back to the note...\nEma:\nThat note was apparently written by the victim.\nPhoenix:\nBut why would he feel the need to write instructions to himself like this? Are you sure the victim wrote it?\nMaya:\nI sometimes write a note to myself before I go shopping. Potatoes, carrots, onions, flour...\nPhoenix:\nUh, Maya? Are you craving curry rice or something?\nMaya:\nWhoops.\nPhoenix:\nSo, Ema, where's this \"vista deck\" the note mentions?\nEma:\nIt's that heliport you see right outside the window over there.\nPhoenix:\nSo he'd planned on pushing Ellen off from there? What a monster.\nGloomsbury's Note added to the Court Record.\nNote (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nHey, what's this?\nMaya:\nOoh, let me take a look! \"Grab Ellen when convenient, then send her off from the vista deck.\" ............\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like a note outlining the murder plot...\nMaya:\nWhoever wrote it has better handwriting than me, but it looks like they wrote it in a rush.\nPhoenix:\nAnd why do you say that?\nMaya:\nBecause the writing is only smudged starting from the middle of each line. That happens when a right-handed person with a slight hook writes in a hurry. I do it sometimes myself when I'm not paying attention to where my hand is on the page.\nPhoenix:\nGuess I'll take your word on that, Ms. Bad Handwriting Expert.\nMaya:\nHey! Even I don't smudge my handwriting this badly!\nPhoenix:\nAll right, all right. Let's get back to the note...\nEma:\nThat note was apparently written by the victim.\nPhoenix:\nBut why would he feel the need to write instructions to himself like this? Are you sure the victim wrote it?\nMaya:\nI sometimes write a note to myself before I go shopping. Potatoes, carrots, onions, flour...\nPhoenix:\nUh, Maya? Are you craving curry rice or something?\nMaya:\nWhoops.\nPhoenix:\nSo, Ema, where's this \"vista deck\" the note mentions?\nEma:\nIt's that heliport you see right outside the window over there.\nPhoenix:\nSo he'd planned on pushing Ellen off from there? What a monster.\nAfter examining bloody valve handle, body outline, petal, and note:\nPhoenix:\nI guess that about does it for this lantern.\nBroken Pegabull lantern (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nLet's take another look at this lantern, shall we?\nTalk\nWhat happened\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth wouldn't tell us anything about this case. So do you think you could give us a rundown?\nEma:\nWell, seeing as he's going to be prosecuting, I'd expect him to be tight-lipped about it. The incident occurred yesterday, on September 20th. It happened after the wedding reception, which lasted from 7 PM to 10 PM.\nPhoenix:\n7 PM to 10 PM, huh? Got it. Um, by the way... ...you didn't hear about any time traveling or anything, did you?\nEma:\nTime traveling? What do you mean?\nPhoenix:\nOh, uh, nothing. Forget it. (That's pretty much the response I expected.)\nEma:\nThe victim's name is Dumas Gloomsbury. He was a servant in the Sprocket family household.\nPhoenix:\nEllen was a maid for that family as well, so that means... ...the two of them were co-workers?\nEma:\nYes. They apparently knew each other. Mr. Gloomsbury was the lead servant, after all. He was very serious about his work, but he was also a very closed and private man... ...so the other servants called him \"Mister Doom-n'-Gloom\" behind his back.\nPhoenix:\nIf he was the lead servant, he must've been higher-ranked than Ellen. What makes the police think Ellen killed this man, a guy who was essentially her boss?\nEma:\nWe don't know the defendant's motive yet... ...but the circumstances surrounding the discovery of the body don't bode well for her.\nPhoenix:\nAnd what circumstances are these, exactly?\nEma:\nWell, some of her in-laws saw what looked like the immediate aftermath of the murder. The suspect was standing in front of the body with the murder weapon still in her hands.\nPhoenix:\nBut why would a bride, who was just about to start a happy new life, kill someone? Do the police have an explanation for that?\nEma:\nYeah, about that... They believe the victim attacked the suspect and was killed when she fought back.\nPhoenix:\nBut why did he attack her to begin with?\nEma:\nWell, a mere servant girl was going to suddenly be the wife of the future president. Mr. Gloomsbury must've been more than just a little jealous of her...\nMaya:\nSo this \"Mister Doom-n'-Gloom\" attacked Ellen first? But if she was only trying to protect herself... ...wouldn't that count as justified self-defense on her part, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nIt would. There's a good chance she'd be acquitted if we could prove that, but... (I wonder what Edgeworth will have up his sleeve to counter that claim?)\nMaya:\nBut, wow. A servant girl marrying the future president of such a huge company... It sounds like a modern-day fairy tale!\nEma:\nIt does, doesn't it? Thing is... ...not everyone was on board with their union, apparently.\nThe murder weapon\nPhoenix:\nSo what was the murder weapon, Ema?\nEma:\nThis clock with a secret mechanism built into it. It was on display here in the reception hall. The suspect was holding it when the murder was discovered.\nPhoenix:\nSo the victim was clubbed to death with this, huh? But that's funny. There's no blood on it as far as I can tell.\nEma:\nMaybe it was wiped off in an attempt to tamper with the evidence? But there was definitely a luminol reaction... ...and it matches up with the shape of the injury, so it's gotta be the murder weapon.\nMaya:\nWhat a funny-looking clock.\nEma:\nThey call it the \"Time Keeper.\" The idea is that it's a time machine. Every time the couple sees it, it'll bring them back to the memory of their wedding day.\nPhoenix:\n(A time machine, huh? Come to think of it... Ellen said her pendant was part of a time machine... I wonder how the secret mechanism in this thing works.)\nTime Keeper added to the Court Record.\nThe murder weapon (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nSo what was the murder weapon, Ema?\nEma:\nThis clock with a secret mechanism built into it.

I wonder how the secret mechanism in this thing works.)\nA star-crossed marriage (appears after \"What happened\")\nEma:\nThe suspect never had any family or relatives to depend on... ...so she was working as a live-in maid for the Sprocket family to support herself.\nPhoenix:\nSo a maid with no family or fortune was set to marry the president's son, huh? I guess it's not surprising that ruffled a feather or two.\nEma:\nYes. Apparently, the groom's parents and all of his other relatives were strongly opposed. But that didn't stop the young couple from deciding to go ahead with their wedding.\nMaya:\nLove flourishes in the face of adversity!\nPhoenix:\nOh? Is that how it works?\nMaya:\nYup! If you ever have any questions about love, just ask me! I'm a qualified expert! I spent all of my spare time in Khura'in watching soap operas on TV.\nPhoenix:\nI'm not sure that's enough to make you a qualified anything, Maya...\nEma:\nOh, and by the way... I heard the suspect faced her fair share of harassment, too. And from the sound of it, it got pretty ugly for her.\nPhoenix:\nHmm... So even though this incident could cause a huge scandal for the company... ...it might be a boon for those who opposed their marriage to begin with. After all, with Ellen's arrest and everything, the marriage is most definitely off now...\nPresent\nBroken Lantern, Photo of Victim, or Gloomsbury's Note\nEma:\nIt's absolutely unbelievable. What kind of monster would plan to commit a murder on somebody's happiest day?\nPhoenix:\nI take it this means you don't have any significant new leads...\nEma:\nNo, I'm afraid not. You?\nPhoenix:\nI've got nothing.\nEma:\nI wish I could be of more help.\nPhoenix:\nWell, thanks anyway. I appreciate it. All we can do is keep on keeping on, right?\nTime Keeper\nPhoenix:\nSo you're sure this is the murder weapon in this case?\nEma:\nPositive. The shape of the victim's injuries and the shape of this clock are a perfect match.\nPhoenix:\nI see...\nEma:\nI daresay that if somebody were to get knocked over the head with this thing... ... it's more likely to cut off their future than send them to the past!\nPhoenix:\nI can't disagree with you there.\nAnything else\nEma:\nIs there something I can do to help you with that?\nPhoenix:\nActually, I was hoping it would help me move my investigation along...\nEma:\nSorry, but that's not going to do much for you here, I'm afraid.\nPhoenix:\nThat's too bad...\nEma:\nAww, don't look so glum. You have to keep a positive outlook! Why don't you take a break with something sweet? I highly recommend Snackoos, myself. You want to try some?\nPhoenix:\nUh, no thanks. I appreciate the offer, though.\nEma:\nSuit yourself... You don't know what you're missing.\nAfter clearing all Talk options and examining wallet, intact Pegabull lantern, fog machine below model hot-air balloon, bloody valve, body outline, petal, and note:\nPhoenix:\nWell, I guess that just about does it for the crime scene.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick. I want to see the rest of the airship! We might as well, since we're here!\nPhoenix:\n(True. We might even run into some of the other people involved in the case.)\n???:\n............\nPhoenix:\n!\nMaya:\nN-Nick, how long has that guy been standing there?\nPhoenix:\n(I didn't even notice him until just now.) Excuse me. Are you with Sprocket Aviation?\n???:\n...............\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMaya:\nNick! He wrote something on that paper airplane!\nPhoenix:\nI guess we're supposed to read it, then?\n???:\n...............\nPhoenix:\nLet's see here... \"Get out, intruders.\" (Well! That was a rather cold welcome.)\nEma:\nMr. Wright, Maya, meet the lone son of the president of Sprocket Aviation... ...Sorin Sprocket. Or, to put it another way: the future president of Sprocket Aviation.\nPhoenix:\nSo he's Ellen's fiancé?\nSorin:\n............\nPhoenix:\nOh, there he goes...\nEma:\nHe's kind of an eccentric. I hear he's the genius inventor behind many of Sprocket Aviation's business successes.\nPhoenix:\nAn inventor, huh...?\nEma:\nYup. He even designed this airship.\nPhoenix:\nThat's pretty impressive.\nMaya:\nNick! This is no time to be standing around gawking! We have to go after him! We need to ask him some questions about Ellen!\nPhoenix:\nOh. R-Right. (It looked like he was heading outside.)\nWright Anything Agency or Detention Center\nPresent\nBroken Lantern\nMaya:\nThis poor Pegabull. He used to be so handsome, and now look at him. I wonder if I can fix him?\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait, Maya! You can't tamper with important evidence like that! So don't even think about it!\nMaya:\n...I bet Ema would let me do it if I asked!\nPhoenix:\nIt's not like building a plastic model, you know. Just leave it to the professionals.\nMaya:\nI guess you're right. But I could've remodeled him into something even cooler!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm pretty sure \"remodeling\" falls under the category of \"evidence tampering,\" too.)\nPhoto of Victim\nMaya:\nI'm dying to find out who killed Mister Doom-n'-Gloom. So let's hurry up and find some evidence, and solve this case already!\nPhoenix:\nThen why don't you lend me a hand?\nMaya:\nWhat do you think I'm doing here! Now, let's find the truth together!\nGloomsbury's Note\nMaya:\nOl' Gloomsy's handwriting sure is neater than mine.\nPhoenix:\nMaybe it's because the other servants had to be able to read his writing, too?\nMaya:\nBut some of the words in this are smudged.\nPhoenix:\nI guess he rubbed them with his hand as he was writing. Judging by the content, I'm guessing he wasn't in the best frame of mind when he wrote it.\nMaya:\nI'll say... A scary note like this would rub anyone the wrong way...\nTime Keeper\nPhoenix:\nThe Time Keeper... If you really CAN travel through time with this thing, I'd go back to before the incident.\nMaya:\nThat's it? Come on, Nick! You can think bigger than that! We could go back to the age of the dinosaurs! Or even the heyday of samurais and ninjas! Can you imagine how much fun it would be?!\nPhoenix:\n(I can imagine how much it would screw up our present day...)\nSeptember 21Sprocket Park - Mooring Dock\nPhoenix:\nThere he is. Excuse me. Could we talk to you?\nSorin:\n............\nPhoenix:\nExcuse me. Do you mind if I ask what you're doing?\nSorin:\n............! ............\nMaya:\nH-He sure is writing up a storm!\nSorin:\nIt IS possible. If an enormous change in mass could be detected at that observation point... ...then theoretically, matter can retain its form, even as it crosses the event horizon...\nPhoenix:\nL-Let's just see what he has to say about Ellen...\nTalk\nEllen\nPhoenix:\nExcuse me, but we'll be representing Ellen in court tomorrow... ...so, could we ask you about the case?\nSorin:\n............ ............\nPhoenix:\n...Ow! Wh-What the...? \"Not interested.\" \"Not interested\"?! How can you say something like that?!\nMaya:\nThis is about your fiancée! She's under arrest, you know!\nSorin:\n............ ...The diameter of the airship is approximately eighty feet. The amount of energy necessary to move matter comprised of that amount of mass is...\nPhoenix:\nHe's off in his own little world.\nMaya:\nI can't believe he said he was \"not interested\" in talking about his own bride's arrest!\nPhoenix:\nWe'll just have to talk on his level, then, with something he might be interested in.\nEllen (after clearing \"Ellen\" Talk option and presenting Ellen's Pendant)\nPhoenix:\nWe'd like to ask you about Ellen's case, if you don't mind.\nSorin:\n............ I don't know a thing about it, so why don't you go ask the police?\nPhoenix:\n(In other words, \"Not interested\"...)\nMaya:\nThis guy is the worst! Now I feel sorry for poor Ellen.\nPhoenix:\nIn that case, can I ask you about how Ellen traveled through time?\nSorin:\n............ Go on.\nPhoenix:\nGuess that got your attention...\nMaya:\nSo... is time travel really even possible?\nSorin:\nYes, it IS possible.\nPhoenix:\n(A-All righty, then...)\nSorin:\nAt the same time, it is also impossible. The pendant I gave Ellen... ...is not supposed to operate as a time machine by itself.\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean?\nSorin:\nThe Time Keeper, that clock we had displayed in the reception hall... ...THAT is the body of the time machine. The pendant is simply a part.\nMaya:\nThat clock was the murder weapon, wasn't it? But it's a time machine, too?\nSorin:\nWhat Ellen experienced is akin to traveling down a road by car key. Physically and metaphysically, it should be impossible. ......Unless... maybe the quantum system inside the pendant... ...somehow accidentally interfered with the natural flow of the fourth dimension...?\nPhoenix:\n......We're losing him again... ...Maybe we'd better ask him some more about the time machine.\nThe time machine (appears after \"Ellen\")\nLeads to:\n\"So you've been researching time travel, have you?\"\nPresent\nEllen's Pendant or Time Keeper (before clearing \"Ellen\" Talk option)\nSorin:\n......... What are you showing me that for? ............ ............\nPhoenix:\nMr. Sprocket!\nSorin:\n...........\nPhoenix:\n(I can't read him at all. Not even with an item as loaded with sentiments as this...)\nEllen's Pendant (after clearing \"Ellen\" Talk option)\nPhoenix:\nCould you take a look at this?\nSorin:\n! I-Is that... Ellen's?\nPhoenix:\nEllen told us that she traveled through time during the incident. She said it happened after she made a wish on this pendant.\nSorin:\n...... You mean to say you two are Ellen's lawyers?\nPhoenix:\n...Yes. I told you that just a minute ago.\nSorin:\nSorry. I was lost in thought.\nMaya:\nHe wasn't even listening?\nPhoenix:\nOh, boy. (He's not at all what I expected... based on Ellen's gushing testimonial, anyway...)\nAnything else\nSorin:\n............ ............\nPhoenix:\nDoes this bring anything to mind?\nSorin:\n............ ...........\nPhoenix:\nEven some small, vague detail will do...\nSorin:\n........... ............\nPhoenix:\nAck! (This guy really doesn't want to talk, does he?)\nPhoenix:\nSo you've been researching time travel, have you?\nSorin:\nMoving through the space-time continuum would be man's ultimate means of travel.\nPhoenix:\nTime travel as a mode of transportation?\nSorin:\nSince the dawn of time, man has developed multifarious methods of transportation. Horses, steam engines, gas engines, airplanes, spaceships... But they are all fundamentally similar, in that they constitute three-dimensional movement. Travel through the space-time continuum would shift mankind into a new paradigm.\nMaya:\n......I don't know why, Nick, but I'm getting awfully sleepy all of a sudden... (Changed from [......I don't why, [sic] Nick, but I'm getting awfully sleepy all of a sudden...] in the original release)\nSorin:\nFor generations, Sprocket Aviation has advanced the development of transportation. Therefore, it's only natural that I would research time travel as man's next great leap.\nMaya:\n*yaaaaawn* Oh! Is he done? So what exactly does all that stuff he was saying mean, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nWell, basically, it's like taking a hamburger joint... and adding a drive-thru to it, I guess?\nMaya:\nOh, I get it! It's the same burger, but with a quicker and more efficient delivery system! So what Sorin really wants to do is... ...lunch humanity into the future!\nSorin:\n\"Launch,\" not \"lunch.\"\nPhoenix:\nBut do you really believe that time travel is possible?\nSorin:\nIt only becomes truly impossible when man stops daring to believe. Besides... time travelers do exist, you know. But you wouldn't understand.\nMaya:\nDid you hear that, Nick? Time travelers really do exist!\nPhoenix:\nAll I know is, Sorin isn't the easiest guy to wrap your head around...\nMaya:\nOh, I don't know. I kind of like the way he talks. It's full of hope for the future! He's more passionate than I thought, too... When it comes to inventions, anyway.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah. His apparent lack of concern for Ellen is troubling, though...) So, I hear that the rest of the Sprocket family was opposed to your marriage. What are your thoughts on that?\nSorin:\n...............I...\n???:\nMaster Sorin. It is time for the meeting on next term's project.\nSorin:\n............\n???:\nWhat is this? Daydreaming about your inventions again? Tut, tut. You are the future president. You must consider the business side, too. It is I. I found Sorin. Send the car over at once.\nSorin:\n......I'm not interested.\n???:\nOh, Master Sorin. You do give me quite the headache at times. In any case, your attendant is waiting. Please go to him now.\nSorin:\n............\nPhoenix:\nExcuse me, but who are you?\n???:\nOh, where are my manners? My name is Pierce Nichody. Please call me Pierce. I am the Sprocket family butler.\nMaya:\nN-Nick! A butler! I didn't know they actually still existed! I thought they were just on TV and stuff!\nNichody:\nAnd who might you be, if you don't mind my asking?\nPhoenix:\nOh, I'm Phoenix Wright, Ellen Wyatt's lawyer.\nMaya:\nAnd I'm his assistant, Maya Fey. I'm a spirit medium.\nNichody:\nOh! So it is you. I am most grateful to you for taking on Miss Ellen's defense. You have my sincerest thanks.\nPhoenix:\nD-Don't mention it. So hey, speaking of the case...\nNichody:\nOh. One moment, please. ............\nMaya:\nWow! What a beautiful pocket watch!\nNichody:\nOh, this? It's just a bit of a good luck charm.\nPhoenix:\n(That's one expensive good luck charm... But I guess it makes sense. Knowing the time is pretty important in his line of work. So I guess that pocket watch is as important to him as my attorney's badge is to me.)\nNichody:\nThere is a little time before I must attend to Master Sorin again. Why not come to Sprocket Manor?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? You mean, to Sorin's home?\nNichody:\nAs a token of appreciation for taking on Miss Ellen's defense... ...I would like to serve you some delicious tea and refreshments.\nMaya:\nOh, boy, Nick! A fancy high-society tea party! With high-class snacks and everything!\nPhoenix:\nAnd what about the investigation?!\nMaya:\nAre you kidding? What better place to investigate next than Sorin's house?!\nPhoenix:\nI don't know. Do you really think his house is going to give us any new leads?\nMaya:\nOf course it will! I say we take the butler up on his kind offer and go to Sorin's place!\nPhoenix:\nAll right, all right. You win.\nNichody:\nVery good. To Sprocket Manor, then.\nSeptember 21Sprocket Manor - Foyer\nMaya:\nWow! This place does NOT disappoint! Ooh, I'm so excited!\nPhoenix:\nWhoa! Slow down, Maya! The mansion isn't going anywhere!\nNichody:\nNow, then. We won't have to worry about anyone untoward eavesdropping here. I take it you wanted to ask me some questions...?\nPhoenix:\nHuh?! ......THAT'S why you invited us here?!\nNichody:\nI am sorry to have tricked you like this. But this IS a murder, after all. I couldn't talk openly about it in public and risk sullying the Sprocket family's reputation.\nMaya:\nAww... And I was REALLY looking forward to all those fancy snacks, too...\nPhoenix:\nThere, there, Maya. Don't cry. (Hmm... This Pierce guy is one shrewd man...)\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Look at that cute vintage radio!\nPhoenix:\n(Radio...? Oh, that thing under there, under the stuffed bull's head.)\nMaya:\nI'm gonna take a closer look!\n*CRASH*\nPhoenix:\nI thought I told you to settle down...\nMaya:\nI'm sorry...\nNichody:\nNot to worry.\nPhoenix:\n(Wow, that little mech fixed it right up!)\nNichody:\nI am not only the butler, but I'm also Sprocket Aviation's repair department director. One might say that \"patching things up\" is my specialty.\nMaya:\nThat was incredible! What IS that little doohickey on your shoulder, anyway?\nNIchody:\nIt's my \"FXR-UPR\" shoulder mech. Master Sorin made it for me. It has too many features and functions to effectively enumerate at the moment, though.\nMaya:\nThat's so cool! I wish I had one of those!\nNichody:\nFixing things is a simple matter. But fixing people is a different matter... Even a skilled physician can't bring back the dead. Oh, but forgive me. I seem to have gotten sidetracked.\nPhoenix:\n(He must be in shock over Mr. Gloomsbury's death... Still, I do need to ask him some questions about the case. I should take a look around and see what I can find out while I'm here, too.)\nExamine\nBull head\nPhoenix:\nA bull... Come to think of it, there was a bull logo on the side of the Flying Chapel, too.\nMaya:\nThe president of the company must have a thing for cattle!\nLady:\nThe bull is the symbol of Sprocket Aviation. \"To be as strong and steady as a bull.\" That's the company creed, you know.\nPhoenix:\n(Probably for all the back-breaking labor they put their employees through...)\nLady:\nBy the way, that bull logo on the Flying Chapel -- the one with the rainbow wings? His name is \"Rainy the Rainbull.\" Get it?\nMaya:\nI get it! He's a rainbow-colored bull, so he's a \"Rainbull,\" right? What a memorable name, huh, Nick!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, for the lameness of the pun...)\nRadio\nPhoenix:\nDon't you dare touch that radio again. It looks like an expensive antique.\nMaya:\nWhat are you worried about? If it breaks again, Pierce will just fix it up again!\nPhoenix:\n(I really hope he's nice enough to waive the repair bill...)\nPropeller\nMaya:\nNick! Look at that airplane propeller up there going round and round!\nPhoenix:\nI see they've got an aviation theme going on. Makes sense for an airline family. I wonder if it doubles as a fan.\nMaya:\nOoh! What if the rest of the plane were on the other side of the wall?! And the wall would open up so the plane could take off in an emergency! How cool would that be!\nPhoenix:\nIf that's what's behind the propeller wall, then what's behind the bull wall across the way? Oh, I know! Maybe it's the rest of him! That must be where the Sprockets get their milk!\nMaya:\nNick... First of all, that's a beef cow. And second, bulls don't make milk.\nPhoenix:\nOh. Right... (That's what I get for trying to play along...)\nBouquet\nPhoenix:\nOh, it's the bridal bouquet.\nMaya:\nHey Nick, how about I throw it, and you try to catch it?\nPhoenix:\nWhy me?\nMaya:\nJust because. I bet you'd look hilarious flailing around trying to grab it.\nPhoenix:\nBut doesn't tradition dictate that it's the ladies that go after the bouquet?\nMaya:\nWho cares! Just catch it! Here!\nPhoenix:\nOw! H-Hey! You threw that right at my face!\nLady:\nOh, you don't want to catch THAT bouquet. Trust me.\nMaya:\nWhy not?\nLady:\nThey say it's bad luck to catch the bouquet of a marriage that doesn't last.\nPhoenix:\nB-But I already caught it...\nMaya:\nWhoops. Too late now, huh, Nick.\nPhoenix:\n............\nFilm camera or photos on table\nPhoenix:\nOh, are those pictures of the wedding reception?\nMan:\nYes, I took them with my trusty camera here.\nMaya:\nUm... do you mind if we have a look at that photo?\nMan:\nBe my guest! Take as long of a look as you'd like. Well, what do you think of this gorgeous dreamscape? A thick fog billows across the room, making it look as if the couple were walking on clouds.\nMaya:\nWow... Look at how beautiful Ellen is here! She looks a little nervous, though.\nPhoenix:\nShe does, doesn't she.\nMaya:\nHey, look! There's Pierce!\nPhoenix:\nReally? Where?\nMaya:\nRight there, behind the sweetheart table!\nPhoenix:\nHey, you're right. I bet he was there attending to the happy couple the whole dinner.\nMaya:\nSo, what do you think, Nick? Does anything in this photo stick out at you?\nPhoenix:\nNo, not at the moment, anyway.\nPhoto of Reception added to the Court Record.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick? If Ellen really did travel back in time... ...do you think this photo is of the second reception -- you know, after the time jump?\nPhoenix:\nHmm... I wonder. Excuse me. Sir?\nMan:\nYes? Can I help you?\nPhoenix:\nEllen told us she traveled back in time. Would you happen to know anything about that?\nMan:\nOh, um... N-No... I-I... I-I haven't the foggiest idea what you're talking about!\nPhoenix:\n? (He clammed up faster than a clam!)\nFilm camera or photos on table (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nYou don't see cameras like this anymore.\nMaya:\nThat's for sure! Cameras these days are so small and easy to use. But these old retro ones are cool, too!\nMan:\nI'm glad to hear you appreciate them. *ahem* This camera was made in the late 1800s. As for this particular model, it is...\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry! We'd really like to hear more about your camera, but we have to go.\nMaya:\nAww, Nick! But it sounds so interesting!\nPhoenix:\nWe have to get back to our investigation, remember? (Preferably before we get our ears talked off!)\nMan:\nOh, what a shame. We'll have to get together and talk some other time, then. Over tea, perhaps?\nCard on floor\nPhoenix:\nExcuse me, but there's a card here on the floor.\nMan:\nWell, look at that. It's a Flying Chapel key card.\nPhoenix:\nThe Flying Chapel? What areas on the Flying Chapel require a key card, if I may ask?\nMan:\nMostly areas we want to keep the public out of... ...such as the staff room and the hold, which is chock full of machinery.\nPhoenix:\nSo you can't enter those areas without a key card?\nMan:\nThat's right... Hm? This one here belongs to Ellen.\nPhoenix:\n(Wait, what's Ellen's key card doing here?) Did Ellen come back here after the incident occurred?\nMan:\nI don't believe so. And she was arrested by the police straight away this morning. Although... there was a strange man with a gaudy jacket in here earlier.\nPhoenix:\nWas that man... wearing a beret, by any chance?\nMan:\nYes, he was, as a matter of fact! He was also wearing sunglasses and a fake mustache!\nPhoenix:\n(I knew it... The only question is, what was he doing here?)\nCard on floor (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nUm... Would you like me to pick up that key card? It's pretty important, isn't it?\nMan:\nNo, that's all right. I'm waiting for that new maid over there to notice it.\nPhoenix:\nI-I see.\nMan:\nIt's a part of our training process for new servants, so please don't help her. Don't worry. I'll keep an eye on the key card.\nPhoenix:\nAll right... (The Sprocket household sure runs a tight airship...)\nFramed photo\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Now, here's a real lady!\nPhoenix:\nShe looks smart as a whip, doesn't she?\nMaya:\nI wonder who she is? We didn't see her on the airship...\nMan:\nThat is Selena Sprocket... Sorin's elder sister. Beautiful and capable, she was a great lady.\nPhoenix:\nSorin's sister... Hmm... I think I see the resemblance. (Maybe I'll show Pierce this photo later and ask him about her.)\nSelena Sprocket Photo added to the Court Record.\nFramed photo (subsequent times)\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Now, here's a real lady!\nPhoenix:\nShe looks smart as a whip, doesn't she?\nMaya:\nI wonder who she is? We didn't see her on the airship...\nMan:\nThat is Selena Sprocket... Sorin's elder sister. Beautiful and capable, she was a great lady.\nPhoenix:\nSorin's sister... Hmm... I think I see the resemblance.\nTalk\nThe incident\nNichody:\nAbout the incident Miss Ellen was arrested for... ...do you think she did it?\nPhoenix:\nWell, I can't prove it yet, but no, I don't think she could've done it. I guess you could call it a gut feeling.\nNichody:\n...... I see. I guess we have different opinions, then.\nPhoenix:\nDo we, now?\nNichody:\nThe prosecution says that when Gloomsbury attacked Miss Ellen, she fought back... ...and ended up killing him. I agree with this perspective. Or rather, that is the consensus of the entire Sprocket family.\nPhoenix:\n...Even so, I heard an interesting story from Chief Prosecutor Edgeworth. I heard that the Sprocket family had tried to pressure the Prosecutor's Office... ...into burying this case.\nNichody:\nI fear you are mistaken. All we sought was merely a legal consultation. Besides, none of it matters now, as she is no longer a part of this family. Fortunately for us, they had yet to get their marriage license before holding the banquet.\nPhoenix:\n(So basically, once they realized they couldn't sway the prosecution, they cut her loose...)\nNichody:\n......I realize how callous I must sound. But my duty is to protect the Sprocket family, and more specifically... ...Sprocket Aviation's future and Master Sorin, whose genius is essential to the company. I will do anything to achieve that goal. That is my job as the Sprocket family butler.\nMaya:\nYou know, I think Pierce and Mr. Edgeworth would get along really well. Don't you think?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. I could easily picture Edgeworth with a butler.\nNichody:\nOh, and by the way... I suppose I should tell you about this as well... It's about when the members of the extended family and I discovered the crime.\nTime travel\nPhoenix:\nUm, did Ellen say anything to you about traveling through time?\nNichody:\n...She must have been delirious. There is no need to take such a claim seriously.\nPhoenix:\nSorin himself said that time travel was possible, though.\nNichody:\n! ......Master Sorin... said that? ......It sounds like he is still stuck in the past.\nPhoenix:\n(He's psychologically stuck, I take it...)\n*ring* *ring*\nNichody:\nExcuse me. What is it? ............I see. I believe I told you the madam will be having milk tea. Still, have lemon slices at the ready, just in case. We must not disappoint her, understand?\nPhoenix:\nYou sure are busy.\nNichody:\nAll in a day's work. ...Still, we really do need Master Sorin to start focusing on the business side of things soon.\nPhoenix:\nUm, could you tell us about that thing you mentioned about Sorin's past?\nNichody:\nThere is something in Master Sorin's past that he wishes he could change... Please forgive me. This isn't something I should be sharing with strangers.\nPhoenix:\n(Now I really want to know what Sorin's still hung up on...)\nDiscovering the crime (appears after \"The incident\")\nNichody:\nIt was sometime after the reception. Some of the master's relatives and I went to clean up the reception hall... ...and that is when we saw it. A woman standing in front of the victim with the bloody murder weapon in her hand... It was none other than Miss Ellen.\nPhoenix:\nBut, Pierce, it wasn't what it looked like!\nMaya:\nThat's right! She just happened to find the body!\nNichody:\nI do not know what Miss Ellen has told you, but what we witnessed... ... was unmistakably the moment immediately after the deed had been committed.\nPhoenix:\nNngh...\nNichody:\nAnd that is what I told the police who came in response to my call.\nPhoenix:\nI-I see... (So Pierce was the one who reported it to the police, huh?)\nSorin's past (appears after presenting Selena Sprocket Photo)\nNichody:\nMaster Sorin will become the next president of Sprocket Aviation. However, that wasn't always so. Miss Selena Sprocket, Master Sorin's elder sister, was next in line.\nMaya:\nSo why isn't she becoming the next president?\nNichody:\n......Because she died... in a car accident.\nMaya:\nWhat?!\nPhoenix:\nI-I had no idea...!\nNichody:\nActually, Master Sorin was also in the car with her at the time of the accident. Losing the sister he loved right before his eyes devastated him. Ever since then, he has buried himself in his research on time machines. He also became a quiet and meticulous -- almost compulsive -- note-taker around then.\nMaya:\nHe seems so stiff and robotic -- I had no idea he was carrying all that around inside him...\nNichody:\nMaster Sorin has abandoned the company business and spends all his time on inventions. As the family butler, I am truly concerned. I believe it is high time he let go of the past.\nPresent\nEllen's Pendant or Time Keeper\nNichody:\nMaster Sorin made the Time Keeper as a symbol of their love for each other. ...A symbol now tainted with blood. I can only imagine how shocking this must be for Master Sorin.\nPhoenix:\nBut surely Sorin believes in the woman he loves.\nNichody:\nMaster Sorin has the future of Sprocket Aviation to think about. He cannot afford to let his personal feelings affect his judgment.\nPhoenix:\nTh-That's awful!\nNichody:\nYou might think so, but that's the kind of responsibility he must bear.\nPhoenix:\n(All because he's in line to be the next president, huh? Sounds like it's not going to be easy to find out how Sorin really feels about anything...)\nFlying Chapel Pamphlet or Photo of Reception\nNichody:\nThis incident has severely damaged the company's reputation. I expect reservations for weddings on the Flying Chapel will face an unfortunate decline.\nPhoenix:\nPierce, you just lost a subordinate... ...yet, all you can think about is the business?\nNichody:\nI am not made of stone, I assure you. But if this company were to go under because of this incident... ...countless employees would lose their jobs.\nPhoenix:\nI-I see...\nNichody:\nTo be honest, I wish we could have hidden this tragedy from the public... ...but now that it's going to trial, I suppose there is nothing to be done about it.\nPhoenix:\n(So the fate of this company depends on this trial... This is more than I bargained for...)\nPhoto of Victim or Gloomsbury's Note\nNichody:\nGloomsbury... How could he do something so deranged? It is truly a shame. As a servant, he was a cut above the rest.\nPhoenix:\nMr. Gloomsbury worked under you, correct? Were there any signs that he was going to do anything like that to Ellen?\nNichody:\nNo, he gave no indication whatsoever. If only I'd realized what he was up to sooner...\nPhoenix:\nI-I see...\nSelena Sprocket Photo\nPhoenix:\nPierce, the woman in this photo is Sorin's older sister Selena, right? I don't think we've met her yet.\nNichody:\nYes, about that...\nPhoenix:\n(He seems... hesitant, all of a sudden.) If you wouldn't mind... ...could you tell us about her?\nNichody:\nA-All right. Very well. She's a big part of Master Sorin's past, after all...\nPhoenix:\nSorin's... past?\nAnything else\nNichody:\nAnd what is this?\nPhoenix:\nJust wondering if there is anything you can tell me about it.\nNichody:\nHmm... I'm afraid not.\nPhoenix:\nI-I see.\nNichody:\nTime is money, as they say, so perhaps you should learn to spend it more wisely.\nPhoenix:\nR-Right. (Good advice, but his chilly attitude is giving me some serious goose bumps...)\nAfter clearing all Talk options and examining bouquet, film camera or photos on table, and card on floor:\n???:\nHey, Nick! What are you doing here?\nPhoenix:\nLarry?\nLarry:\nOh, man! Edgey gave me a heckuva hard time!\nPhoenix:\nLarry, what are YOU doing here?\nLarry:\nI came to promote my new character, Cupiglet! I was hoping Sprocket Aviation would do some kind of tie-in with me for it!\nMaya:\nWow. I didn't know Larry was such an aggressive businessman. You could learn a thing or two from him, Nick. Why don't you promote your agency to them?\nPhoenix:\nNow's not exactly the time for that, in case you haven't noticed.\nMaya:\nSee? And this is why you'll never be rich!\nPhoenix:\nActually, Larry, I've been meaning to ask you something. You were on the Flying Chapel yesterday, right?\nLarry:\nHuh? Was I...? Er...\nPhoenix:\nWhat were you doing there?\nLarry:\nN-Nothing...\nPhoenix:\nWhatever it was, I bet it wasn't anything to be proud of. But never mind that. Did you see anything that had to do with the case? ......Scratch that. Let's start with, you weren't INVOLVED in this case, were you?\nLarry:\n! ............\nPhoenix:\nLarry...?\nMaya:\nHey! He took off!\nPhoenix:\nI just knew it... When something smells, it's usually the Butz... Come on, Maya! After him!\nNichody:\nOh, are you leaving so soon?\nPhoenix:\nWe, uh, have to run... Thank you for making time for us.\nNichody:\nI know you have to investigate, but please try to spare the family's feelings as you do.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, of course.\nSeptember 21Sprocket Park - Mooring Dock\nPhoenix:\nThere he is. Hey, Larry!\nLarry:\nH-Hey, there, friend! Fancy meeting you here!\nPhoenix:\nThere's nothing \"fancy\" about it. All we did was follow you. So, tell me, Larry. Why did you run away like that?\nLarry:\nHuh? Me? ...I don't know what you're talking about. A bolt of inspiration for my new picture book hit me and I had to run is all. It was, like, a \"Cupiphany!\" You dig?\nPhoenix:\nRiiiiight...\nMaya:\nHe's just going to keep on playing dumb, isn't he, Nick?\nTalk\nWhat you saw on the airship\nPhoenix:\nCome on, Larry. I know you were on that airship, so what did you see?\nLarry:\nI-I didn't see anything! I didn't see anything 'cause I was never on that stupid airship!\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPhoenix:\n! Psyche-Locks...\nLarry:\nYou say something?\nPhoenix:\n(The spiritual power of this magatama allows me to see... ...these mystical locks that appear when someone is trying to hide something from me. They're called \"Psyche-Locks,\" and when I see them... ...I simply present the magatama ([X / Y / R]) to try my hand at breaking them. (Changed from [...I simply touch the magatama (X) to try my hand at breaking them.] in the original release) If I can unlock them, I'm sure to finally get a straight answer out of him!)\nPresent Magatama\nPhoenix:\n2 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n-- What Larry Is Hiding --\nPhoenix:\nThis is no time for games, Larry. I WILL find out what you're hiding.\nLarry:\nI'm telling ya, Nick, you've got it all wrong. I've got nothing to do with this case, whatsoever!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, come on, Larry! Even a baby could see through such a blatant and obvious lie.) \"Nothing whatsoever,\" huh? If you weren't involved, Larry, then you wouldn't have been involved with this person.\nPresent Ellen Wyatt profile\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"You're the one who brought Ellen to my office in the first place.\"\nPresent anyone else\nPhoenix:\nLarry:\nHuh? What are you trying to say, Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Oops. Looks like I got it wrong.) J-Just ignore I said that!\nLarry:\nJeez. Get a grip, will ya?\nLeads back to:\n\"If you weren't involved, Larry, then you wouldn't have been involved with this person.\"\nPhoenix:\nYou're the one who brought Ellen to my office in the first place. ...And all those cops.\nLarry:\nUm...\nPhoenix:\n\"Nothing to do with the case, whatsoever\" isn't gonna cut it this time, Larry! If you have to lie, at least do a better job of it!\nLarry:\nU... UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nLarry:\nD-Don't diss me, Nick! If you're so convinced I'm lying, then lemme ask you this! What makes you think I was on that stupid ol' airship, anyway?! Lemme see some proof! If you've got any!\nPhoenix:\nDoubling down, are you? Fine. You want proof, Larry? Here's proof that you were on that airship!\nPresent Business Card Wallet\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Uh-oh!\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nLarry:\nYou call that proof? Hmph.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh! I must've gotten it wrong!)\nLarry:\nSeriously, Nick. You shouldn't doubt your friends like this. It only hurts the both of us.\nPhoenix:\n(I'd better try that again.)\nLeads back to:\n\"You want proof, Larry? Here's proof that you were on that airship!\"\nLarry:\nUh-oh!\nPhoenix:\nThis is your business card wallet, isn't it, Larry? I found it in the reception hall.\nLarry:\nGah!\nPhoenix:\nTime to come clean, Larry Butz. What exactly are you hiding?\nLarry:\nW-WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! ...... A-All right! Fine! Ya got me! I'll tell you everything!\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nUnlock Successful\nWhat you saw on the airship (after breaking Psyche-Locks)\nPhoenix:\nLarry, what were you doing on that airship, anyway?\nLarry:\nWell, I went there to deliver the \"Welcome to Our Wedding\" sign they ordered from me.\nPhoenix:\nHuh. I didn't know you took on real jobs like that, too.\nLarry:\nWell, for your information, my wedding welcome signs are very popular on the Net!\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's how you met Ellen?\nLarry:\nUh-huh. I mean, I'd seen her in the photo for the welcome sign, but seeing her in person... The way she smiled at me and said, \"Thank you\"... *sigh* I felt like I'd been hit by lightning!\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's when you fell in love with somebody else's bride, huh? So, were you invited to the reception?\nLarry:\nCan you believe they told me only family and relatives could attend?! They wouldn't even let me into the reception hall!\nPhoenix:\n(Smart move on their part, I'd say.)\nLarry:\nI got upset, and started wandering around the airship. That must be when I dropped my business card wallet.\nPhoenix:\n(So somebody else must've found it... ...and brought it to the reception hall, then.)\nLarry:\nBut you know what? I saw something incredible while I was on that Flying Chapel!\nPhoenix:\nLike...?\nLarry:\nGet a load of this!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What the heck is this?\nLarry:\nWhaddaya mean, \"what is this\"? Isn't it obvious? It's a drawing! I sketched a picture of one of the cabins on the airship.\nPhoenix:\nSo what's so incredible about a cabin?\nLarry:\nLook at what was outside the window! It's one of those flying dinosaurs -- a real live pterodactyl! I looked out the cabin window and there it was, just flying out there! That airship traveled through time, I tell you!\nPhoenix:\nWh-Wh...\nMaya:\nWHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!\nLarry:\nWhen I told that Pierce butler guy about it... ...he told me to never mention it to anybody ever again.\nPhoenix:\nBut why would he try to keep you from spouting what is clearly just nonsense?\nLarry:\nMaybe Sprocket Aviation is secretly developing a time machine!\nPhoenix:\n......N-No way...\nMaya:\nN-Nick, this case is... ...totally amazing! Larry! You didn't tell Mr. Edgeworth about this, did you?\nLarry:\nOf course not! Edgey would just roll his eyes and think I was off my rocker. I didn't even tell him I was wandering around on the airship. I told him I met Elly at the mooring dock and we ran away together.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... I can see Edgeworth's eyes rolling right out of his head had he heard about this.\nLarry's Drawing added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\n(So Larry also experienced the time slip somehow... But how is that possible...?)\nLarry:\nHey, Nick. I'll be taking my card wallet back now, if you don't mind.\nBusiness Card Wallet swiped back by Larry.\nLarry:\nOh, yeah. This is for you.\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it?\nLarry:\nIt's a picture of the hold. I took it when I was wandering around on the airship. See? There's Elly right there in the middle.\nPhoenix:\nUm, the hold?\nLarry:\nYeah, see? It's right here on the diagram.\nPhoenix:\nOkay. So now I know where the hold is. But what was Ellen doing there?\nLarry:\nWell, they were using it as a prepping area for the reception.\nPhoenix:\nI see. And around when did you take this?\nLarry:\nBefore the reception. I took it while Elly was getting everything ready.\nPhoenix:\nSo this was taken before the incident occurred... I don't know if it'll be of any help, but thanks for this anyway.\nPhoto of Hold added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nBy the way, Larry. I heard that the door to the hold is controlled by a security system. So how'd you get in there?\nLarry:\nTh-That's...! A trade secret! Can't tell ya!\nPhoenix:\n(And the hits just keep on coming...) Well, I guess that's basically a wrap on the investigation.\nMaya:\nNot quite, Nick! I want to meet Ellen, too!\nPhoenix:\nOh, that's right. You haven't met her yet, have you? Okay. Let's head over to the detention center, so you can say hi.\nWhat you saw on the airship (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nLarry, what were you doing on that airship, anyway?\nLarry:\nWell, I went there to deliver the \"Welcome to Our Wedding\" sign they ordered from me.\nPhoenix:\nHuh. I didn't know you took on real jobs like that, too.\nLarry:\nWell, for your information, my wedding welcome signs are very popular on the Net!\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's how you met Ellen?\nLarry:\nUh-huh.

I can see Edgeworth's eyes rolling right out of his head had he heard about this.\nPresent\nBusiness Card Wallet\nPhoenix:\nI found this in the reception hall.\nLarry:\n........... Say, that's a pretty stylish wallet, ain't it?\nPhoenix:\nHave you ever seen it before?\nLarry:\n............Nope.\nPhoenix:\n(I'll take that as a \"yes\"... Which means he must be trying to hide something from me.)\nLarry:\nI-I don't know anything about that wallet!\nPhoenix:\n(I'll just have to take him to task later...)\nSelena Sprocket Photo\nLarry:\nWhoooooooa! Who is she? Who is this lovely vision?\nPhoenix:\nLarry... *sigh* This is Sorin's older sister. She died in a car accident.\nLarry:\nNooooooooo! How could such a beautiful flame have been snuffed out like that?! If she were alive today, I bet I could've made her happy.\nPhoenix:\nThat's funny. I thought you were in love with Ellen?\nLarry:\nDon't get me wrong, Nick. I just wanna make all the pretty ladies of this world happy, that's all!\nPhoenix:\nI-I think you're the one getting it wrong...\nAnything else (before breaking Psyche-Locks)\nLarry:\nHm? Do you really think you can prove Elly's innocence with that?\nPhoenix:\nIf I knew, I wouldn't need to conduct an investigation, now would I? Now, look at the evidence, Larry! Can you tell me anything about it?\nLarry:\nHmm.... Hmmmmmmmmmmm... Hmm... Nope. Sorry! Can't think of a thing.\nPhoenix:\n(Good thing I had low expectations from the start then...)\nBusiness Card Wallet (after breaking Psyche-Locks)\nLarry:\nAll right, I admit it! That super stylish business card wallet is mine! What more do you want outta me?! ...Wait. Don't tell me you were hoping to keep it for yourself?\nPhoenix:\nWhy would I want a card wallet with your face on it?!\nLarry:\nAww, don't be shy! Tell you what, Nick. I'll have one sent to your office. I'll even throw in a \"good friend discount\" on it, too.\nPhoenix:\nI'd still have to pay?! (Trucy's going to take it out of my hide, too, once she sees that in the expenses book.)\nLarry's Drawing\nLarry:\nHey! That's the drawing I made. You'd better take care of it. I bet it's gonna be valuable some day! Oh, do you want me to add a character or something to it?\nMaya:\nOoh, could you? I'd love to see a true artist at work!\nPhoenix:\nHold it! As farcical as this drawing is, there will be no doodling on the evidence until the trial is over.\nLarry:\nWh-Whaddaya mean, \"farcical\"?! I'm never gonna draw anything for you ever again! Not even if you beg me!\nMaya:\nAww... Guess that's that, huh, Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(Need I remind you that it's still a piece of evidence, Maya...?)\nAnything else (after breaking Psyche-Locks)\nLarry:\nWhat are you showing me that for? Is this an interrogation? Okay, sure, I snuck onto that airship and was wandering around it all by my lonesome. But you gotta believe me! I didn't kill anybody!\nPhoenix:\nAnd WHY were you sneaking around on that airship in the first place?\nLarry:\nBecause... it was fate...? Yeah, that's it! I was just following my destiny! That's all I've ever done!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, come on, Larry... Are you seriously going to blame all the trouble you've ever caused on fate?)\nWright Anything Agency, Reception Hall, or Foyer\nTalk\nAny ideas?\nPhoenix:\nThe internal affairs of a powerful and wealthy family... I get the feeling this is going to get messy. What are your thoughts, Maya?\nMaya:\nHmm... Prestigious families like this tend to try and protect their reputation, don't they?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. That's the thing.\nMaya:\nBut at least YOU don't have much of a reputation to protect. That means you can do anything you want to win this case!\nPhoenix:\nWho says I don't have a reputation to protect?!\nWhat to do\nPhoenix:\nI still can't help but wonder... You know this time travel thing Ellen keeps talking about... Do you think it really happened?\nMaya:\nOh, I believe it happened!\nPhoenix:\nY-You do?! Based on what?\nMaya:\nWell, it's not really based on anything, exactly... It's just that it's so much more fun to believe that it really happened! As soon as this case is over, I'm going to go talk with Sorin Sprocket myself. I'm going to ask him to send me back to medieval times!\nPhoenix:\nW-Well, I guess it's nice to have a dream... (Just please don't let the fantasy of time travel turn real in this case...)\nPresent\nLarry's Drawing\nMaya:\nLarry's a really good artist, isn't he? No wonder he's a famous picture book author!\nPhoenix:\nWell, he's really good at something all right. Namely, at causing trouble wherever he goes.\nMaya:\nBut he's also helped you out of a bind or two before, right?\nPhoenix:\nI guess so... (But that's not usually until after he's made a mess of things first...)\nAfter clearing \"What you saw on the airship\" Talk option in Sprocket Park - Mooring Dock:\nSeptember 21Detention Center - Visitor's Room\nEllen:\nNo! Why?!\n???:\nPlease understand that this is in Master Sorin's best interest.\nPhoenix:\n(Sounds like Ellen's busy talking with someone...)\nNichody:\nThe next president cannot be married to a criminal. It would disgrace Sprocket Aviation. Miss Ellen, I need you to forget about this marriage.\nPhoenix:\nPardon us...\nNichody:\n! ...If it isn't Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nSo... their marriage is definitely off?\nNichody:\nThere is no other choice. We cannot have a criminal in the family. For the sake of Master Sorin and the Sprocket family, this is what is best.\nEllen:\n*sniffle* Nooooo...\nMaya:\n... Um... in that case... ...what if Nick here proved Ellen's innocence? Then you wouldn't have a criminal in the family, right?!\nNichody:\n! ......I-I suppose you are right, but I am afraid that will be impossible.\nMaya:\nThat's not true! Not for Nick. He may look like a nobody, but he can do some pretty amazing things!\nPhoenix:\n......I don't take cases on lightly, so rest assured, I will prove her innocence.\nNichody:\nMr. Phoenix Wright... I understand your name is quite well-known in the judicial world... For better or for worse.\nPhoenix:\n...Pierce, I want you to promise me this: If I can prove Ellen's innocence... ...then you won't stand in the way of Sorin and Ellen's marriage.\nNichody:\n......Hmph. Very well. But not even the most talented lawyer in the world can change reality itself. And the reality is, Miss Ellen is guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt.\nPhoenix:\nI believe that's where you're wrong, Pierce.\nEllen:\nI'm clean! I swear I am! Obsessively, compulsively, clean! Just as clean and pure as this pure-white dress!\nNichody:\n...Fine. You have my word. But you will be the one to regret this promise. ......Now, if you will excuse me.\nPhoenix:\n(...Now I have all the more reason to win this case.) Ellen, we finished our investigation, and we'd like to talk with you about what we found.\nEllen:\nOkay! So what did you find out?\nTalk\nInvestigation results\nPhoenix:\nIn the course of our investigation, we heard that... ...you had been standing in front of the victim with the murder weapon in your hands.\nEllen:\n! I-It wasn't what it looked like! It's true I was holding the murder weapon... ...but when I found him, he was already dead. I-I panicked... ...and I was hoping I could go back in time again, like I had done earlier. So I picked up the Time Keeper from the pedestal and brought it over without thinking.\nPhoenix:\nYou were so desperate, you were ready to try anything, huh... Unfortunately, that sort of behavior makes you an easy target for the prosecution.\nEllen:\nNo...\nPhoenix:\nAnd as for your little trip through time... ...none of your in-laws could confirm your story, I'm afraid.\nEllen:\nI... I see...\nPhoenix:\nThe only exception is Larry. He said he saw something.\nEllen:\nReally? Wh-What did he see?\nTime travel (appears after \"Investigation results\")\nLeads to:\n\"Can't say I quite believe it myself, but Larry claims he saw something incredible.\"\nPresent\nEllen's Pendant, Flying Chapel Pamphlet, Broken Lantern, Time Keeper, or Photo of Reception\nEllen:\nOoooooh...\nPhoenix:\nWh-What's wrong?\nEllen:\nI just remembered our reception... We were supposed to be so happy together! Oh, where did it all go wrong...?\nPhoenix:\n(I can't blame her for being upset.)\nEllen:\nWhy did this have to happen to me? UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!\nPhoenix:\nE-Ellen! Please try to calm down! Okay?!\nEllen:\nA-All right...\nPhoenix:\n(Well, she stopped crying, but... ...how can I ask her about anything when she's still so clearly distraught?)\nPhoto of Victim\nEllen:\n*gulp*\nPhoenix:\nA-Are you all right?\nEllen:\nI-I... don't feel very well...\nMaya:\nNick! That photo is a bit much for most normal people, you know!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, I guess you're right. (Oops, that was pretty inconsiderate of me...)\nGloomsbury's Note\nPhoenix:\nEllen, can you tell if this is Mr. Gloomsbury's handwriting?\nEllen:\nNo. I'm sorry. I'm not very familiar with his handwriting.\nPhoenix:\nI see... (And unless the handwriting is very distinct, I know it's often hard to tell.)\nEllen:\nI-I'm sorry, but I'm not very comfortable with looking at a note which details... ...a plan on how to murder me written on it...\nPhoenix:\nOh, sorry... I guess that should go without saying...\nSelena Sprocket Photo\nEllen:\n*sniffle* Oh, poor Selena... I feel so sad about what happened to her...! SELENAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!\nPhoenix:\nYikes! Ellen, please try to calm down! Pretty please? With sugar on top?\nEllen:\nSorin and I were supposed to be happy -- for Selena's sake, too. WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!\nMaya:\nWe... should probably leave this topic alone, Nick...\nPhoenix:\nCan't say I quite believe it myself, but Larry claims he saw something incredible. He claims he saw a pterodactyl flying outside the airship.\nEllen:\nWh... WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!\nPhoenix:\nNot only that, but apparently Pierce Nichody told Larry to keep quiet about it.\nEllen:\nBut why would Pierce do such a thing?\nMaya:\nLarry's theory is that Sprocket Aviation is developing something in secret. A time machine, to be exact.\nEllen:\nDo you think... Do you think that's why nobody would confirm my story? Because it's a secret?\nPhoenix:\nI-I really don't know. But speaking of your in-laws... ...we did manage to find your key card at Sprocket Manor. One of your in-laws said he'd keep an eye on it for you.\nEllen:\nOh, thank goodness! I lost it while I was getting things ready for the reception. I'd looked everywhere for it! I'm so glad you found iiiiiit!\nPhoenix:\n(A-At least they're tears of joy this time, for a change...)\nMaya:\nWell, Nick... It looks like you'll have to prove the existence of time travel in court tomorrow!\nEllen:\nThat's right! I swear that while Mr. Gloomsbury was being killed... ...I was busy traveling back through time!\nPhoenix:\nGreat. With stodgy, skeptic Edgeworth at the helm for the prosecution tomorrow... ...we're really gonna have our work cut out for us. *sigh*\nTo be continued\nNothing to examine during investigation\nPhoenix:\nNothing particularly interesting here.\nArea already examined\nPhoenix:\n(We've already searched here, but it never hurts to take another look around.)\nExit Magatama session\nPhoenix:\n(I think I'd better take a step back and gather my thoughts a little more...)\nTurnabout Time Traveler\nImage Gallery\nTranscript\nPart 1\nPart 2\nPart 3\nPart 4\nSeptember 22, 8:45 AMDistrict Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3\nEllen:\nGood morning, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nGood morning, Ellen. I see you're still wearing your wedding gown.\nEllen:\nAnd I will continue to wear it until our marriage is saved! ......... Oh! S-Sorin!\nSorin:\n.............\nMaya:\nDo you think he came to see how she's holding up?\nEllen:\nSorin, my love! You came all the way to the courthouse just to see me? Oh, Sorin! I don't know what to say!\nSorin:\n......Blueprints.\nEllen:\nHuh?\nSorin:\nThe engine blueprints... I can't find them. Do you know where they are?\nEllen:\nOh! They're in your room, third shelf from the bottom, on the right-hand side.\nSorin:\n......Ah. I see.\nPhoenix:\nHe's leaving already...?\nMaya:\nDon't tell me he came just to ask about some stupid blueprints? Is he really that cold of a person, or is that just how he comes off, I wonder...\nEllen:\n*sniffle* Wh-What about me, Sorin...?\nSorin:\n......Ellen.\nPhoenix:\n(He's back.)\nSorin:\n............ ...Come home soon. ......I'm... lost without you.\nEllen:\n............S-S-S-Soriiiiiiiiiiiiin!\nSorin:\nLater...\nMaya:\nLooks like showing your vulnerabilities is the fastest way to capturing a woman's heart. You should take notes on this, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nPlease leave me out of this. (Anyway, it looks like Sorin isn't big on words... ...but it's clear that he cares about Ellen. Knowing that, I actually feel kind of relieved.)\nEllen:\nMr. Wright! I just absolutely CAN'T be found guilty, you hear!\nPhoenix:\nDon't worry. I'm going to do everything I can to prove your innocence.\nEllen:\nTHANK you, Mr. Wright!\nBailiff:\nThe trial is about to start, sir.\nPhoenix:\n(.........Edgeworth. Knowing him, he's not going to yield an inch. So I've just got to fight with everything I've got and save Ellen!)\nSeptember 22, 9:00 AMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 6\nDay 1Court Is Now In SessionAll Rise\nJudge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Ellen Wyatt.\nPhoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.\nEdgeworth:\nThe prosecution has been ready for a while, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nSeeing so many familiar faces gathered together like this... I feel as though I'm at a grand reunion. It makes me want to go out for dinner and a drink, and reminisce with all of you.\nMaya:\nOh! That sounds like a great idea! I was dying for a real burger the whole time I was away!\nPhoenix:\nWe could make it a welcome back party for Maya. How about it, Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\n.........I have no intention of cavorting with my enemies. Now then, Your Honor, let us start this trial at once.\nJudge:\nHo ho. Still not one for lighthearted banter, are you, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. Jokes and good humor are beyond worthless in a court of law.\nMaya:\nGuess we'll just have to have the party without him, then.\nEdgeworth:\n............ However, were it after the conclusion of this trial... ...I might consider joining you for your little welcome back party. I certainly wouldn't mind an invite, at the very least.\nMaya:\n...He's still as emotionally constipated as ever, I see.\nJudge:\nNow then, Mr. Edgeworth, if you could please go over the details of this case for us.\nEdgeworth:\nThe victim was Dumas Gloomsbury, a servant in the Sprocket household. He was in attendance at the wedding reception that occurred from 7 PM to 10 PM. Mr. Gloomsbury apparently felt some animosity toward Ellen Wyatt, and so... ...a bit after the reception ended at 10 PM, he assaulted Ms. Wyatt with the intent to kill her. The defendant fought back, and ended up killing Mr. Gloomsbury.\nJudge:\nHmm... In other words... it was justified self-defense, correct? If that's the case, then the defendant might not be criminally responsible.\nPhoenix:\n(He's right... Worst-case scenario, I could go for self-defense to avoid the criminal charge. I wonder how Edgeworth plans to counter that, though...?)\nEdgeworth:\n...The prosecution's first witness will make my view on the matter clear, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nVery well. Bailiff, please bring in the first witness.\nEdgeworth:\nPlease state your name and occupation, witness.\nEma:\nEma Skye. Forensic investigator. A-And I'd just like to say, sir...! That being in the same courtroom as you is a great honor!\nEdgeworth:\n......Hm?\nPhoenix:\nOh, that's right... You're a fan of Edgeworth's, aren't you, Ema?\nEma:\nWe're good friends and all, Mr. Wright... ...but, just this once, I intend to faithfully and fully testify for the prosecution! And I do mean that wholeheartedly!\nEdgeworth:\nHeh. I expect no less from you.\nEma:\nYes, sir! I'm going to do my very best!\nMaya:\nLooks like you lost the popularity contest to Mr. Edgeworth, Nick.\nPhoenix:\n...Meh, I really could care less. Besides... ...she'll see who's the better lawyer once I win this trial.\nMaya:\nYeah... Maybe then you'll actually really care less.\nJudge:\nNow, Detective Skye, if you please.\nWitness Testimony\n-- Rundown of the Case --\nEma:\nThe murder weapon was a clock called the \"Time Keeper.\"\nThe victim was hit with it from behind, and he fell over, right into the lantern.\nThe defendant was spotted then, standing in front of the body holding the murder weapon.\nThe victim was struck twice, by the way.\nPhoenix:\nHe was struck twice?\nEma:\nThat's right. There's no mistake about it. The first blow was to the back of the victim's head. It was hard enough to knock him unconscious. Yet, despite the fact that he had been immobilized by the first blow... ...the defendant delivered a second, fatal blow to the side of the victim's head.\nPhoenix:\n...Which means... what, exactly?\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. I figured it would go right over your head. Let's put it this way: By striking the victim a second time... ...the defendant killed her last chance to escape from any criminal wrongdoing.\nJudge:\nShe did? But how, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nThe defendant may have been fighting back because she was being attacked. However... ...she then went on to deliver a fatal blow to a man who was already fully unconscious.\nMaya:\nN-Nick, is he saying what I think he is...?\nPhoenix:\nI don't feel so well...\nEdgeworth:\nAnd thus, Mr. Wright, has justified self-defense been removed from the table. The prosecution intends to prove that the defendant killed the victim... ...with murderous intent. Allow me to, belatedly, submit the victim's autopsy report.\nPhoenix:\n......A... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRNNGH! (So THAT'S why he was acting all smug...! Well, more smug than usual...)\nMaya:\nI-It's fine, right? It's not like we were going to plead self-defense anyway, right?\nPhoenix:\nRight, but... now the judge has a negative impression of Ellen.\nJudge:\n............\nEdgeworth:\nHmph.\nPhoenix:\n(He may not get to prosecute much anymore, but he definitely hasn't lost his touch.)\nAutopsy Report added to the Court Record.\nJudge:\nNow, then, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- Rundown of the Case --\nEma:\nThe murder weapon was a clock called the \"Time Keeper.\"\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nAre you completely sure the murder weapon was the Time Keeper?\nEma:\nYes, completely. The shape of the injury on the victim's head matches up with that of the Time Keeper. And it's definitely heavy enough to kill someone with.\nPhoenix:\nBut would the defendant have been able to pick up and swing something so heavy?\nEma:\nI tried it myself, and I was able to lift it up just fine.\nPhoenix:\nMaybe you're just freakishly strong...?\nEma:\nExcuse me, Mr. Wright?! I'll have you know that people on the force know me as the dainty forensic investigator!\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry... (...But really, you're hardly a delicate flower.)\nEdgeworth:\n...Mr. Wright. This is a court of law. Save your antics for after the trial, if you know how.\nPhoenix:\nYes, sir... It won't happen again, sir...\nEma:\nHmph! ...Moving on!\nEma:\nThe victim was hit with it from behind, and he fell over, right into the lantern.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThe defendant was fighting back against the victim, right? If so, wouldn't she have hit him from the front and not from behind?\nEma:\nThe victim must've tried to run once Ms. Wyatt started fighting back. That's probably when he got hit from behind.\nPhoenix:\nI see... Thus, the blow to the back of his head.\nEma:\nThe defendant must've looked awfully scary when she was brandishing that clock.\nPhoenix:\nI don't know about that... (Regardless of how scary Ellen looked, the victim was definitely hit from behind...)\nEma:\n...May I go on?\nPhoenix:\nYes, of course. Please do.\nPresent Photo of Victim\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Detective Skye, I'm afraid I have to apologize in advance.\"\nEma:\nThe defendant was spotted then, standing in front of the body holding the murder weapon.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nB-But that's only because she was so panicked when she found the body... ...that she tried to use the Time Keeper to go back in time.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Wright... Do you have any idea how absurd you sound?\nPhoenix:\nB-But Ms. Wyatt really believed she could travel through time with that clock!\nEdgeworth:\nYou really should've come up with a more credible story, you know.\nJudge:\nYes, I agree.\nPhoenix:\n(Me, three... But it's all I have to go on...)\nEma:\n...Anyway, under the circumstances... ...the only conclusion we can draw is that the defendant killed the victim.\nEma:\nThe victim was struck twice, by the way.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nMs. Wyatt must've had a chance to escape after she struck the victim the first time. So why would she stick around and hit him with such a heavy object again?\nEma:\nWell, about that...\nEdgeworth:\nAllow me to explain. Why did she strike him again, indeed? To finish off the victim, of course. This very act clearly shows that she had every intention of killing Mr. Gloomsbury!\nPhoenix:\nUrk!\nMaya:\nBut Ms. Wyatt would never do a thing like that!\nEdgeworth:\nThen let's see some evidence that disproves my theory!\nMaya:\nNnrrgh...! Are you going to just stand there and take that from him, Nick?!\nPhoenix:\n(I can't refute his claim head-on, so I'll have to approach it from a different angle.)\nPhoenix:\nWell... ...it looks like we won't be going anywhere until we can refute Edgeworth's claim.\nMaya:\nThis is so exciting! We haven't taken on Mr. Edgeworth in ages!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah...\nMaya:\nOkay, Nick! Now, go get him!\nPhoenix:\nNo need to rush me, Maya... (All right. I'd better start by comparing Ema's testimony with the evidence we have... ...and look for any glaring inconsistencies!)\nPhoenix:\nDetective Skye, I'm afraid I have to apologize in advance.\nEma:\nFor what?\nPhoenix:\nFor embarrassing you in front of your idol.\nEma:\nWh-What do you mean?\nPhoenix:\nIf you take a look at this photo of the crime scene... ...you'll see that the victim is lying on his back. But if the victim had been hit from behind as you claim... ...then he should have fallen over into the lantern facedown.\nEma:\nAaaaah!\nPhoenix:\nIt's not enough to simply take someone's side, Detective Skye. Even if it's Mr. Edgeworth's.\nEma:\nAh...! Oooh...\nJudge:\nHmm... There does appear to be a flaw in Detective Skye's testimony.\nEma:\nEma:\nMr. Wright! If you think I'm going to just back right down, then you're sadly mistaken!\nPhoenix:\n(Ema is unusually fired up today...)\nMaya:\nDon't forget, she's in front of her hero, Nick. If the Steel Samurai came to watch this trial, I'd want to do my absolute best, too.\nEma:\nListen, Mr. Wright. It's entirely possible that the defendant moved the victim's body after he fell over. In that case, there wouldn't be any contradiction, right?\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed. That was an excellent counterargument, Detective.\nEma:\nYou can count on me, sir! So, what do you have to say to that, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nIs it possible that the victim's body was moved after he fell into the lantern?\nIt's possible\nPhoenix:\nThe defense believes... it's possible that the victim's body was moved by the defendant!\nMaya:\nWh-What are you doing, Nick?! You're backing up Ema's claim?!\nPhoenix:\n......Oops! I meant to answer in the negative!\nJudge:\nIn other words, you wish to claim the exact opposite of what you just said? A reversal that dramatic... ...deserves an equally dramatic punishment.\nPhoenix:\nThere's no need to be such a drama queen about it, Your Honor... (Well, I guess this leaves me with just one answer. I can't mess this up now!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Is it possible that the victim's body was moved after he fell into the lantern?\"\nIt's not possible\nLeads to:\n\"Sorry, Detective, but there's no way the victim's body was moved after his death.\"\nPhoenix:\nSorry, Detective, but there's no way the victim's body was moved after his death.\nEma:\nOh, really? And what makes you so sure?\nPhoenix:\nOne look at this here, and it should become obvious.\nPresent rubble on top of body\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Th-Those broken bits of the lantern?\"\nPresent anywhere else\nPhoenix:\nEma:\nUm... What exactly are you pointing at, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nOh... uh... This right here?\nJudge:\nHmm... What you're trying to communicate is not obvious at all, Mr. Wright. But this penalty should make my feelings on the matter pretty obvious -- even to you.\nPhoenix:\n(The only thing that's obvious right now is the pain in my attorney's badge.)\nLeads back to:\n\"One look at this here, and it should become obvious.\"\nEma:\nTh-Those broken bits of the lantern?\nPhoenix:\nYes. If the body had been moved after the fact, these fragments would've fallen off of it. But, as you can clearly see, they're lying perfectly undisturbed on top of the body. This means that the victim must've been lying face up from before the lantern even broke.\nEma:\n.......You're right!\nMaya:\nBut wait a minute. If that's true... ...then when was the victim killed? I mean, the lantern was still whole during the reception, right?\nPhoenix:\nRight. Which means we've just overturned a major assumption about this case. If the victim was already dead before the lantern was even broken... ...then the body must've been inside the lantern since before the reception started. In other words... ...the defense asserts that the victim was killed before the wedding reception!\nJudge:\nWH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!\nPhoenix:\nIn short... ...when Ms. Wyatt was seen standing in front of the body after the reception... ...it wasn't the moment just after the murder was committed. It was the moment she happened to discover the body -- just as Ms. Wyatt claims!\nEma:\nAAAAAAAAAAH!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. Whether the act was committed before or after the reception is entirely inconsequential. After all, it was the defendant who prepared the reception hall for the event in question. Therefore, when the murder occurred changes nothing with regard to her guilt. She could have killed the victim before the reception, as you claim... ...and then tried to hide his body in the lantern after the event ended!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSorry, but that doesn't make any sense. I mean, where would the body have been hidden during the reception in your scenario?\nEdgeworth:\nUrngh... Th-That's...!\nPhoenix:\nEven you have to admit, Mr. Edgeworth, that this has opened up a new possibility.\nEdgeworth:\nDo explain, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nWell, if Ms. Wyatt didn't commit the crime in the reception hall... ...then that means someone, somewhere put the victim's body into the lantern.\nJudge:\nHmm... I suppose that makes sense. A dead body couldn't have put itself in there.\nPhoenix:\nExactly, Your Honor. In other words... If the murder actually occurred before the reception, it opens up the possibility that...\nHe was killed somewhere else\nLeads to:\n\"If the body was hidden inside the lantern...\"\nThe defendant didn't do it\nPhoenix:\nThe defendant didn't commit this murder!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nOh, for heaven's sake. Even if the murder was committed before the reception... ...that alone doesn't erase the suspicion against the defendant!\nJudge:\nIt seems that was too ridiculous of a leap backwards for Mr. Edgeworth, Mr. Wright. I suggest you look before you leap, and think before you speak.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I got ahead of myself on that one...)\nLeads back to:\n\"If the murder actually occurred before the reception, it opens up the possibility that...\"\nHe was killed some other way\nPhoenix:\nThe victim was killed some other way!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nWhat does the victim's time of death have anything to do with how he was killed? I suggest you read the autopsy report again, Mr. Wright. Especially the part that states that the victim was clubbed to death with the Time Keeper!\nPhoenix:\nIt was worth a try...\nJudge:\nYou should know better than to just say the first shocking thing that comes to mind.\nPhoenix:\n(I've got this. I just have to stay cool and answer rationally.)\nLeads back to:\n\"If the murder actually occurred before the reception, it opens up the possibility that...\"\nPhoenix:\nIf the body was hidden inside the lantern... ...then, it's possible that the body was moved along with it from somewhere else.\nMaya:\nOh! You're right!\nEdgeworth:\nYou can run that mouth of yours all you want... ...but do you have any evidence to support what's coming out of it, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nOf course I do. (I think the answer lies in that piece of evidence -- and in something... ...that was left at the crime scene that will point us to where the victim was really killed!)\nJudge:\nVery well, Mr. Wright. In that case... What proves that the lantern and the body were moved from somewhere else?\nPresent Photo of Victim\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"The photo of the victim again...?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThis proves that the murder took place somewhere other than the reception hall!\nJudge:\nHmm... I'm afraid I can't say that I follow.\nMaya:\nThat piece of evidence won't help you make your point, Nick!\nJudge:\nYet another pointless piece of evidence from a senseless attorney.\nPhoenix:\n(Fine, so this piece wasn't convincing enough. Then there must be something else that would be easier for the judge to understand!)\nLeads back to:\n\"What proves that the lantern and the body were moved from somewhere else?\"\nEma:\nThe photo of the victim again...?\nPhoenix:\nYes. I'd like the court to focus on this thing, right here!\nPresent flower petals\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Flower petals, Mr. Wright?\"\nPresent anywhere else\nPhoenix:\nJudge:\nHmm... I'm afraid I don't get it at all. What exactly are we looking at here, Mr. Wright?\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. That far-off look in his eyes suggests that his mind is equally as far-off in La-La Land.\nJudge:\nThe defense will focus on the trial, if that's not too much to ask.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, that brought me back to reality fast.)\nLeads back to:\n\"I'd like the court to focus on this thing, right here!\"\nEma:\nFlower petals, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nThese petals are from a kind of flower that were not present in the reception hall. This means they must've gotten into the lantern when it was somewhere else.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd just where do you propose this \"somewhere else\" to be, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nI propose that this piece of evidence will tell us where the flower petals came from.\nPresent Photo of Hold\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Please take a look at the flowers in this picture of the hold.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nOne look at this, and you'll see exactly where the petals came from!\nJudge:\n............ Are you sure about that, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nI am, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nBecause I'm afraid I can't see how.\nPhoenix:\nEven if you take a really good look?\nJudge:\nUnfortunately not.\nPhoenix:\nWhat if you... smelled the evidence?\nJudge:\nStill nothing.\nPhoenix:\nHuh. That's odd. Aha ha ha ha...\nJudge:\nThis is no laughing matter, defense! I hope this will teach you to take matters seriously!\nEdgeworth:\nI suggest you refrain from embarrassing yourself any further with such stale jokes.\nPhoenix:\nI'll make sure to whip up a fresh batch for next time, then... A-All joking aside... (Even though I was actually being serious...)\nLeads back to:\n\"I propose that this piece of evidence will tell us where the flower petals came from.\"\nPhoenix:\nPlease take a look at the flowers in this picture of the hold. Notice how their petals are of the same shape as the petals in the crime scene photo?\nJudge:\nHmm, yes. I see. They do look to be from the same kind of flower.\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. Is that really all you've got? A flower is a flower is a flower. They're all the same. I would hardly call what you presented \"compelling evidence.\"\nJudge:\nI'm afraid I couldn't disagree with you more, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nHm?\nJudge:\nI gave a flower of this type to my lovely wife once when we were young. So I can assure you that this is very meaningful and compelling evidence indeed. The soundness of my judgment in this matter is backed by nothing less than pure love!\nEdgeworth:\nB-But, Your Honor...\nPhoenix:\nLet it go, Mr. Edgeworth. It's clear you don't know much about flowers. It's not like you have anyone you'd actually give any to, after all. But maybe you should study up on them, just in case the opportunity presents itself.\nEdgeworth:\nNngoooh! This is from the man who only knows the names of three types of flowers!\nPhoenix:\nTh-That's hardly relevant to the case at hand! The defense asserts that it's highly probable that the victim was killed in the hold! If the body was then placed in the lantern and moved to the reception hall for some reason... ...it would completely destroy the prosecution's case!\nMaya:\nThen you mean, the body was...?\nPhoenix:\nYes. The victim's body was... ...inside the lantern during the entire beautiful wedding reception! While the defendant and her betrothed were celebrating their love!\nJudge:\nWH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAT?!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. Your smooth talk might work on His Honor, but it won't work on me.\nPhoenix:\nWhat are you talking about now?\nEdgeworth:\nTake another look at all of the evidence and you'll soon see what I mean.\nPhoenix:\n............ (I wish he would just tell me already...)\nEdgeworth:\nDetective Skye, I'm sure you've already figured out what I'm talking about, correct?\nEma:\nHeh heh heh. Of course, sir! Mr. Wright is the only one here who hasn't. Why don't you leave this to me, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nVery well. Let's see what you can do.\nJudge:\nDetective Skye, please give your testimony to this court.\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Prosecution's Rebuttal --\nEma:\nThe victim could not have been killed before the reception.\nThe autopsy report states that the estimated time of death was after the reception.\nAnd that estimated time of death is correct. There's no way it could be wrong.\nEma:\nIt's clear Mr. Gloomsbury was killed after the reception. And that completely contradicts your claim!\nPhoenix:\nHmm......... I guess so.\nEdgeworth:\nTell me you took at least a cursory glance at the autopsy report, Mr. Wright. It appears you've grown rusty since our last outing. Might I suggest you go back and brush up on the basics?\nPhoenix:\n......Sure. Though I must say, you're as cocky as ever, Mr. Edgeworth.\nEdgeworth:\nI beg your pardon?\nEma:\nWh-What are you trying to say, Mr. Wright?!\nPhoenix:\nI'm just saying that I'll go back to basics, if that's what Mr. Edgeworth wants. I'll prove how badly he's underestimating me with a good old-fashioned cross-examination.\nEdgeworth:\n...............\nJudge:\nVery well. Let's see you put your money where your mouth is, Mr. Wright.\nCross Examination\n-- The Prosecution's Rebuttal --\nEma:\nThe victim could not have been killed before the reception.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYou sound pretty certain. You must have some solid grounds for making that claim, right?\nEma:\nOf course I do. And you're gonna feel silly when I show you what they are. Ready? Feast your eyes on this!\nEma:\nThe autopsy report states that the estimated time of death was after the reception.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nI've read the autopsy report, too, you know.\nEma:\nThen you don't need me to explain it to you, right? How there's no way the victim could've been killed before the reception, I mean.\nPhoenix:\nDetective Skye... ...I think you've overlooked something big.\nEma:\nI have?!\nPhoenix:\nWhy don't you take another look at the evidence?\nEma:\n...But I've already looked at all the evidence! And quite carefully, too, I'll have you know!\nEdgeworth:\nDetective Skye. Do not be taken in by his verbal antics. He is simply bluffing, as always.\nEma:\nR-Right, sir!\nEma:\nAnd that estimated time of death is correct. There's no way it could be wrong.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nIs it possible that the culprit did something to obscure the real time of death?\nEma:\nNo, not in this case. There was no snow or anything to keep the body from decomposing. And there's no fridge on that airship big enough to fit a body into.\nPhoenix:\nSo you've already checked into that, I see...\nMaya:\nIt all comes down to the estimated time of death, doesn't it? Couldn't the killer mess with the victim's time of death by keeping the body on ice?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, if they had the means to.\nPresent Fog Machine\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"I admit that the estimated time of death does contradict my theory.\"\nPhoenix:\nThe prosecution is treating the estimated time of death as an absolute. But is it really?\nMaya:\nI take it you don't think it is, huh, Nick? In that case, we're going to have to find a way to convince them otherwise!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, there's gotta be a way somehow...\nPhoenix:\nI admit that the estimated time of death does contradict my theory.\nEma:\nFinally! And that means your theory that the victim was killed before the reception...\nPhoenix:\n...Is still entirely plausible!\nEma:\nHuh? Wh-What makes you think that?\nPhoenix:\nThe killer could've falsified the time of death by using a certain item in the reception hall. Please take a look at this.\nJudge:\nAnd what is that contraption, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nIt's a fog machine, Your Honor, used to create a special, romantic atmosphere in the hall.\nJudge:\nAnd this machine could have been used to falsify the time of death?\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor, because this machine uses dry ice to perform its magic.\nJudge:\nDry ice? Ah yes -- the super cold stuff commonly used to make theatrical fog, right? I see. So your claim is that this dry ice was used to keep the body cold?\nEma:\n......Oh...! In that case, I guess the victim COULD have been killed before the reception...\nJudge:\nOrder! Order in this court! Well, Mr. Edgeworth? What do you have to say about this development?\nEdgeworth:\n......That the victim was killed in the hold before the wedding reception? .....The prosecution acknowledges the possibility of this claim.\nPhoenix:\n(Now we're getting somewhere!)\nEdgeworth:\n...The prosecution would also like to thank you, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? For what?\nEdgeworth:\nI didn't know how a certain piece of evidence fit into this case... But now, thanks to you, I do.\nPhoenix:\nWhat piece of evidence?\nEdgeworth:\nTo get into the hold, one needs a key card, like this one. And, here, we have a record of those who entered the hold with such key cards. The times aren't specified, but these are the last three entries on the day of the murder. And as you can see, the last person to enter the hold that day... was the defendant.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What?!\nJudge:\nSo the one who moved the body out of the hold must have been...?\nEdgeworth:\nThat's right. It was none other than the defendant.\nHold Entry Record added to the Court Record.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick, take a look at this entry record. There are a couple of other names on here besides Ellen's.\nPhoenix:\nHey, you're right! According to the entry record, Mr. Edgeworth, Pierce Nichody had also gone into the hold. Isn't it possible that he could've been the culprit?\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nSorry, but Mr. Nichody was escorting a few of the guests at the time. I'm sure they would be happy to testify to that fact, if you'd like. Think me cocky all you'd like, Mr. Wright, but my confidence is rarely misplaced.\nPhoenix:\nArngh...\nEdgeworth:\nNow then, it's probably safe to assume that after killing the victim in the hold... ...the defendant moved his body to the hall in order to dispose of it discreetly.\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean by \"discreetly\"?\nEdgeworth:\nThe defendant volunteered to take care of the reception's cleanup personally. That means she would've had the chance to dispose of anything in any way she wanted. Including taking the lantern off the airship without raising any suspicion. Don't tell me you didn't know about Ms. Wyatt volunteering for cleanup duty, Mr. Wright.\nEllen:\nFor my last task as a servant of the Sprocket household... ...I offered to take on the preparation and cleanup of the reception banquet.\nPhoenix:\nI-I see...\nPhoenix:\nGaaah!\nEdgeworth:\nLook at you, sweating buckets like a rookie... even after all these years. Nevertheless... Thank you for proving that the only person who could've killed the victim in the hold is... ...Ellen Wyatt!\nPhoenix:\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! (Great job, Phoenix. Now we're back to square one!)\nEdgeworth:\nHeh. Perhaps you should ask Ms. Cykes for some help in reviewing Defense for Dummies.\nEma:\nWay to go, sir! You've got Mr. Wright in a cold sweat!\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. I wonder if maybe the promise of seeing that miserable look on his face... ...is what brought me back to court today. It's certainly made all of my stress and woes as chief prosecutor just melt away.\nMaya:\nI guess he had a lot of stress built up.\nPhoenix:\nI'll give him something to stress over before we're through today!\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor, the prosecution asks that you render your verdict at this time. Before that man over there tries to throw the court into chaos with his meaningless bluffs.\nJudge:\n...Hmm, I see. Mr. Wright... ...are there any last meaningful bluffs you'd like to present to this court?\nPhoenix:\nUh... (Why does he have to assume it'll be a bluff?)\nMaya:\nN-Nick! Hurry up and throw a good one out there!\nPhoenix:\nI will! I will! ........... Well, all right, then. Let's see... I-I've got it! How do you know it was Ms. Wyatt who used her key card? After all, if it turns out that somebody else used her card... ...it would mean Ms. Wyatt didn't do it!\nJudge:\nInteresting. And are you able to prove this bluff to be true?\nPhoenix:\nI-I assure you, I'm not bluffing, Your Honor. (Well, now what...?)\nMaya:\nWait a minute, Nick. I can think of a certain somebody who might've used Ellen's key card.\nPhoenix:\nYou can?\nMaya:\nRemember? The one who was sneaking around the hold, in spite of not being a family member...?\nPhoenix:\nOh, that's right! Your Honor! The defense would like to call a certain witness to the stand! I need the testimony of this person, who may have entered the hold with Ms. Wyatt's card!\nPresent Larry Butz profile\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Th-That's your witness?!\"\nPresent anyone else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThis person used Ms. Wyatt's key card to enter the hold!\nEdgeworth:\nWhat are you talking about, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nWait, did I make a mistake...?\nEdgeworth:\nYou would know if you had been paying any attention to our arguments up to this point.\nPhoenix:\n...Ahem. So... So that means...\nJudge:\nExactly. It means you get a penalty.\nPhoenix:\nI was afraid of that.\nEdgeworth:\nI'd advise you to take this a little more seriously, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nAnd I will! Your Honor! The defense would like to call a certain witness to the stand!\nLeads back to:\n\"I need the testimony of this person, who may have entered the hold with Ms. Wyatt's card!\"\nEdgeworth:\nTh-That's your witness?! A-Are you saying that THAT numbskull was on the airship? He never breathed a word about that to me!\nPhoenix:\nThat's not surprising, because Mr. Nichody told him to keep quiet about it. But Mr. Butz himself admitted it to me. He claimed to have found a way to sneak into the Flying Chapel's hold to see Ms. Wyatt. This photo he took and gave to me is proof.\nEdgeworth:\nTh-Then was it he who moved the lantern with the body inside to the reception hall?\nPhoenix:\nYou know as well as I that with him, anything is possible. And this is one possibility we should definitely look into.\nEdgeworth:\n.....I-I can't believe this. What in the world is HE doing mixed up in this?\nPhoenix:\nCome on, Mr. Edgeworth. Remember what we've been saying since elementary school?\nEdgeworth:\n.....\"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\"\nPhoenix:\nExactly.\nEdgeworth:\nGaaaaaagh! That Larry! He'll pay for this!\nPhoenix:\nWell, if you want to extract your payment now... ...he's right up there in the gallery!\nLarry:\nYikes!\nJudge:\nBailiff! Seize the witness before he makes a run for it!\nLarry:\nNoooooooooooooooooo! Why does this stuff always happen to MEEEEEEEEEE?!\nPhoenix:\n(Sorry, Larry... but you brought this on yourself.)\nJudge:\nLet us break for a fifteen minute recess. I ask that both sides prepare for the next witness's testimony during this time.\nSeptember 22District Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3\nMaya:\nWow. It's been a while since I've had this much fun and excitement! A face-off against Mr. Edgeworth! A harrowing tightrope walk for the defense!\nPhoenix:\nWhew! I'm exhausted already.\n???:\nBoss!\nAthena:\nI'm here for moral support!\nPhoenix:\nAthena! Are you all done practicing for Trucy's magic show?\nAthena:\nWell... to be perfectly honest... I sorta ran away. But that's because she was putting my life in danger, I tell you!\nPhoenix:\nI see... I think I'll need to have a one-on-one with her... You're really athletic and fit, Athena, so Trucy probably thinks she can run you ragged.\nAthena:\nThat may be true... ...which is why not even Trucy can keep up with me when I run at full speed!\n???:\nHah! Looks like you spoke too soon, Athena! Never underestimate the resourcefulness of a great magician!\nAthena:\nHuh?\nTrucy:\nMagical Girl Trucy Wright... is on the scene!\nAthena:\nN-Nooooooooooooooooooo!\nTrucy:\nNow, Athena! It's time to practice human combustion magic! Go on, douse yourself in this gasoline! But don't worry! It's a magic trick, after all, so it's perfectly safe!\nAthena:\n......R... R... Run awaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!!!\nTrucy:\nHey, you! You're not getting off that easily!\nMaya:\nHa ha ha! They get along so well, don't they? It reminds me of the good ol' days. You, me and Pearly... Oh, and Detective Gumshoe! Can't forget him. We had all kinds of fun at the crime scenes back then, remember?\nPhoenix:\n...Leaving me to do all the serious investigating as I recall.\nBailiff:\nCourt will soon be back in session, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nRight, thank you!\nMaya:\nSo Larry's the next witness, right? I can't wait to see what happens!\nPhoenix:\nSadly, I can already imagine it...\nSeptember 22District Court - Courtroom No. 6\nJudge:\nCourt will now reconvene.\nLarry:\n......Nick! Edgey! The two of you are gonna hang me out to dry, aren't you?!\nEdgeworth:\nNo, not the both of us. Just Mr. Wright.\nLarry:\nN-Nick... How could you...?\nPhoenix:\n(I don't really think he did it, of course, but I've gotta use whatever leads I can...) Mr. Butz, there's a possibility you moved the lantern that had the dead body in it. So if you want to clear yourself of any suspicion, all you have to do is testify.\nLarry:\n............\nJudge:\nNow then, your testimony, please, witness.\nWitness Testimony\n-- Nick Is A Jerk Face! --\nLarry:\nNick, you big, fat, stinkin' jerk!\nHow can you doubt your best bud?!

Even just a shred?!\nJudge:\nYou may cross-examine the witness, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(I would, if there were any testimony to cross-examine...)\nCross Examination\n-- Nick Is A Jerk Face! --\nLarry:\nNick, you big, fat, stinkin' jerk!\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nCome on, Larry...

They wouldn't even let me into the reception hall!\nLarry:\nUh, y-yeah. So what?\nPhoenix:\nThen, that's odd... No one in this courtroom ever mentioned the sex of the lantern that was moved. So how could you know that it was a \"bull\" lantern?\nLarry:\nY-You didn't have to actually go to the reception to know that!

Because you're you, that's why!\nLarry:\nEdgey...! You think Nick's being awful to me, don't you? So you tell him...! Tell Nick what a big meanie he is!\nEdgeworth:\nI would... if I thought he was being one.\nLarry:\nN-Not you, too! Why doesn't anybody ever take my side?!\nPhoenix:\n(I wish I didn't have to doubt him... But something about what he just said doesn't add up.)\nPresent Flying Chapel Pamphlet\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"I want you to take a look at this, Mr. Butz.\"\nBefore adding statement\nPhoenix:\nWell, I guess about all I can do... ...is try to get some kind of statement out of him somehow.\nMaya:\nGood luck.\nAfter adding statement\nMaya:\nYou finally got a decent statement out of him, huh, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, finally. (It sure took a lot of work, though... I hope all of this leads somewhere...)\nPhoenix:\nI want you to take a look at this, Mr. Butz. Because unfortunately for you, the pamphlet clearly shows... ...a Pegacow and a Pegabull in their example diagram of the reception hall.\nLarry:\nHuh?!\nPhoenix:\nBut on that day, instead of putting a Pegacow and Pegabull out for the bride and groom... ...there were two male Pegabulls on display.\nLarry:\nNnnnngh...\nPhoenix:\nYet, somehow, you knew there were two Pegabulls in the reception hall that day. There's only one way you'd know something like that, Larry... It was YOU who moved the Pegabull to the reception hall, wasn't it?!\nLarry:\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!\nEdgeworth:\nN-No... Larry, y-you didn't...!\nJudge:\nMr. Butz, did you move the lantern containing the victim's body to the reception hall?\nLarry:\nTh-That's what it looks like!\nMaya:\nWhaaaaat?!\nPhoenix:\n............!\nLarry:\nLarry:\nW-Wait! Nick! Y-You don't think I'M the murderer, do ya?!\nMaya:\nMaybe you and Mr. Gloomsbury were fighting over Ms. Wyatt, and you ended up killing him?\nLarry:\nM-Mayaaaaa! Not you, tooooo! Look, I did sneak into the reception, but that's as far as it went. You know me! I wouldn't hurt a fly!\nPhoenix:\nY-You \"snuck into the reception\"...?\nLarry:\nYeah, sure. But some of the Sprocket men caught and locked me up in one of the cabins. It was pretty awful, actually! But that's when I made that drawing of the pterodactyl I showed you, Nick!\nPhoenix:\n(Ix-nay on the erodactyl-ptay, Larry...)\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Wright, not even you would take this farce that far... would you?\nPhoenix:\n............ (We ARE talking about Larry... What do I do? Do I accuse Larry of being the true culprit?)\nAccuse him\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I have no choice but to accuse him...! Wait a minute... But Larry didn't have any reason to kill Gloomsbury!)\nLeads to:\n\"No, you're right, Mr. Edgeworth.\"\nNo, of course not\nLeads to:\n\"No, you're right, Mr. Edgeworth.\"\nPhoenix:\nNo, you're right, Mr. Edgeworth. Mr. Butz didn't have a reason to kill Mr. Gloomsbury. He might've had an imaginary reason to kill Sorin Sprocket, sure, but not Mr. Gloomsbury.\nMaya:\nAfter all, he did steal Mr. Sprocket's bride and try to elope with her...\nLarry:\nJust 'cause I tried to steal somebody's bride doesn't make me a murderer!\nPhoenix:\n......I believe you, Larry. And I don't think you killed anybody, either. You would never do anything like that.\nLarry:\nN-Nick, ol' buddy, ol' pal! I knew you'd come through for me!\nPhoenix:\n(Funny, that, considering your sworn testimony just now that we were through...)\nJudge:\nMr. Butz, it's time you told this court the whole truth. Understood?\nWitness Testimony\n-- Moving the Lantern --\nLarry:\nIt's just like Nick said, I'm the one who moved the lantern.\nI was poking around the reception hall before the main event and saw a lantern was broken.\nThere was a note on it that said, \"Exchange with the one in the hold. --Ellen.\"\nSo I decided to do Elly a favor.\nJudge:\nSo you switched the lanterns before the reception, did you? Then that means the victim really WAS killed before the reception.\nBroken Lantern updated in the Court Record.\nEdgeworth:\nIt would appear... that Mr. Butz completely fell for the defendant's scheme.\nLarry:\nScheme? What scheme?\nEdgeworth:\nThis note from the defendant: \"Exchange with the one in the hold. --Ellen\"... Mr. Butz moved the lantern with the body in it up to the reception hall because of this note. And thus, he has become a suspect in Mr. Gloomsbury's murder.\nLarry:\n*gulp*... That second lantern did feel pretty heavy... ...but I never would've thought there was a dead body in it!\nPhoenix:\n(Arnngh... What was a note like that doing on a lantern in the first place...?!)\nEllen:\nEllen:\nYou've got it all wrong, Mr. Edgeworth! I left that note for myself! It was simply a reminder because I can be very forgetful!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nWhat a sorry excuse, Ms. Wyatt. The prosecution contends that this note shows one facet of the defendant's murderous plan. And you, Mr. Butz, you played right into Ms. Wyatt's hands.\nLarry:\nNo way, Edgey! I don't believe it!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nDo you still really believe Ms. Wyatt to be the culprit, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. Of course. My stance on the matter remains unchanged. If you think I'm wrong, then prove it with your cross-examination.\nPhoenix:\n(Gladly!)\nJudge:\nVery well. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.\nCross Examination\n-- Moving the Lantern --\nLarry:\nIt's just like Nick said, I'm the one who moved the lantern.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nWhy didn't you tell us that sooner?!\nLarry:\nBecause I knew you guys were gonna be suspicious of me, that's why!\nPhoenix:\nWe're suspicious of you now because you tried to hide it!\nEdgeworth:\nMy thoughts exactly.\nLarry:\nHmph! Well, now I've told you! Happy? So how about letting me go?!\nPhoenix:\nNo, not yet. We need you to stick around to sort a few things out.\nLarry:\nGrrrrr! FINE!\nLarry:\nI was poking around the reception hall before the main event and saw a lantern was broken.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThe lantern you swapped out was a female Pegamoo -- a Pegacow, right?\nLarry:\nYeah, I guess.\nPhoenix:\nWhy did you replace a female lantern with a male one?\nLarry:\nBecause I was too busy trying not to get caught. I didn't have time to check for little details like that.\nPhoenix:\nIf you didn't want to get caught, you could've just left well enough alone, you know.\nLarry:\nWhatever! Anyway, when I took a look at the broken lantern, I saw...\nLarry:\nThere was a note on it that said, \"Exchange with the one in the hold. --Ellen.\"\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThat note wasn't addressed to you, was it?\nLarry:\nWell, I guess not, but... ...how could I let my dear, sweet Elly do all that hard physical labor on her own?!\nPhoenix:\n(It's precisely that thought process that constantly gets you in trouble, Larry...)\nLarry:\nBesides, it was my big chance to show her how much I cared about her.\nLarry:\nSo I decided to do Elly a favor.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nNobody saw you the whole time while you were switching the lanterns?\nLarry:\nNope. I didn't get caught. Not that time, anyway.\nPhoenix:\n\"Not that time\"?\nLarry:\nYeah. When I'd tried to sneak into the reception hall the first time... ...I didn't have as much luck. Those Sprocket guys spotted me and nabbed me.\nPhoenix:\nAll of my words are failing me right now...\nLarry:\nPretty exciting, don't ya think?\nPhoenix:\n(Larry... You need help.)\nLarry:\nAnd then they locked me up in one of the cabins. ......Nick, what are you asking about stuff like this for, anyway? Shouldn't you be trying to prove Elly's innocence?!\nPhoenix:\n(Well... Is that statement of his important to the case...?)\nIt's important\nPhoenix:\nMr. Butz trying to crash the reception, and subsequently getting locked up in a cabin... I believe these might be important facts in this case, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nVery well. Mr. Butz, please add that statement to your testimony.\nAdds statement \"I tried to sneak into the reception hall, but I got caught and locked up in a cabin.\"\nIt's not important\nPhoenix:\nGiven the lack of any important info... I guess I can let this line of questioning go for now.\nLeads back to cross-examination\nPress (after adding statement)\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nNobody saw you the whole time while you were switching the lanterns?\nLarry:\nNope. I didn't get caught. Not that time, anyway.\nPhoenix:\n\"Not that time\"?\nLarry:\nYeah. When I'd tried to sneak into the reception hall the first time... ...I didn't have as much luck. Those Sprocket guys spotted me and nabbed me.\nPhoenix:\nAll of my words are failing me right now...\nLarry:\nPretty exciting, don't ya think?\nPhoenix:\n(Larry... You need help.)\nLarry:\nAnd then they locked me up in one of the cabins. ......Nick, what are you asking about stuff like this for, anyway? Shouldn't you be trying to prove Elly's innocence?!\nLarry:\nI tried to sneak into the reception hall, but I got caught and locked up in a cabin.\nPress\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nSo you got locked up. Then what happened?\nLarry:\nI broke out. Then I started looking for Elly and wandered into the reception hall again. That's when I saw the broken lantern and replaced it.\nPhoenix:\n......Even after they caught you and locked you up, you still went looking for Ms. Wyatt? ...But, hold on a minute...\nMaya:\nWhat is it, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nMaya, doesn't something seem weird to you? Larry is saying he replaced the lantern after he broke out of the cabin.\nMaya:\nThat's right-- Oh, wait... Huh? You're right. It doesn't make much sense, does it?\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, have you found an inconsistency in the witness's statement?\nPhoenix:\nYes, I believe so, Your Honor. Mr. Butz moved the lantern after he broke out of the cabin, but that contradicts with this.\nPresent Broken Lantern\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Is that...?!\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nJudge:\nHmm... And in what sense does that piece of evidence contradict with the statement?\nLarry:\nIt doesn't contradict at all, does it!\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed.\nPhoenix:\nUrngh...! Oh, don't mind me, Your Honor. It looks like I just made a tiny mistake. That's all.\nLeads back to cross-examination\nPhoenix:\nKnowing Larry... ...he definitely did something stupid somewhere along the way.\nMaya:\nWow. Larry sure is one special guy... Not everyone has the privilege of being THIS distrusted by their best friends...\nPhoenix:\nAssuming he can't be trusted from the get-go usually makes things easier, I've learned.\nMaya:\nOh, I see! You totally trust him to be totally untrustworthy!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I guess that just about sums it up.\nJudge:\nIs that...?!\nPhoenix:\nYes, it's the broken lantern, Your Honor. Mr. Butz, what you're saying doesn't make any sense at all.\nLarry:\nWHAT?! Why not?!\nPhoenix:\nYou swapped the lanterns before the reception began, right?\nLarry:\nYeah. That's what I said, isn't it?\nPhoenix:\nBut you also just said that you swapped the lanterns... ...after you got locked up in a cabin for trying to sneak into the reception. In other words, you're saying you swapped the lanterns both before the reception... ...and after the reception took place.\nJudge:\nHmm... That certainly doesn't make any sense, does it? Mr. Butz, did you swap the lanterns before or after the reception?\nLarry:\nUmm...\nEdgeworth:\nWhich was it: before or after?! There's a world of difference between the two!\nPhoenix:\nWell, Mr. Butz?\nLarry:\n......I guess I can't expect guys like you to understand. In a nutshell, it was both before... and after the reception.\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nLarry:\nI tried to sneak into the first reception and got locked up.\nPhoenix:\nThe \"first\" reception? (Uh-oh. I don't like where this is going...)\nLarry:\nThen, through the power of Elly's pendant... ...time got rewound, and we went back to the time before the reception. It was after that when I replaced the lantern. So it was both before the reception and after the reception. Get it?\nPhoenix:\n............\nLarry:\nWe went back in time to before the reception. So, of course, the reception would take place one more time after that, right? That's why what I said makes perfect sense!\nEdgeworth:\n......Mr. Wright, what in the world is the witness talking about? Has he developed some sort of intellectual ailment I'm not aware of since I saw him last?\nPhoenix:\n...Um, well...\nLarry:\nNone of the Sprockets seem to remember the time skip, but I do. And Elly remembers it, too! I think the power of our love for each other made that miracle happen!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. I'm sorry, but... ...could you please translate this man's gibberish so the rest of us can understand?\nPhoenix:\n(So now I have to be the one to explain about the whole time travel thing?!)\nLarry:\nGo on, Nick. I know you can do it!\nMaya:\nLooks like you don't have much choice, Nick!\nPhoenix:\n(To heck with it! I can't lose any more of my dignity today anyway!) ............ The defendant, Ms. Ellen Wyatt, has told the defense the following strange story. She said that after the reception ended, she was attacked by Mr. Gloomsbury. She claims that, as she was being assaulted, she made a wish upon her pendant. \"Please, take me back... back to that blissful moment...!\" In doing so... ...time apparently rewound itself to just before the reception began!\nEdgeworth:\n......It what?\nPhoenix:\nI know it's hard to believe, but think about it this way. Through the power of the pendant, both Ellen Wyatt and Larry Butz... ...experienced time travel!\nJudge:\nWh-Wh-Wh.... WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nWhat absolute rubbish! Mr. Wright! I've heard my fair share of your nonsense over the years... ...but this takes the cake! Have you thoroughly lost your mind?!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nBut this is simply the conclusion I came to... ...using that logic ability you love so much.\nEdgeworth:\nWh-What?\nPhoenix:\nThe truth of the matter is, the future president of Sprocket Aviation, Sorin Sprocket... ...has been researching time machines. So, what if a time machine has already been successfully created? And what if that's one of Sprocket Aviation's top secret inventions?\nJudge:\nA-A time machine?!\nLarry:\nYeah! I even saw something while we were time traveling! I saw a pterodactyl flying through the sky! Maybe the airship was set to travel through time for their honeymoon trip?\nJudge:\nWHAAAAAAAAAT?! A-A pterodactyl?!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nY-You can't possibly have any evidence to back up your ridiculous time travel story...!\nPhoenix:\nWell... I, uh...\nEdgeworth:\nHmph. As I thought. In any case, I now have the evidence to prove... ...that you're no more intelligent than Larry!\nLarry:\nLarry:\nNot so fast now, Edgey. I'm not the same ol' Larry you used to know.\nEdgeworth:\n.........Oh?\nLarry:\nYou want evidence? I've got your evidence right here! This is a photo I secretly took of the first reception!\nEdgeworth:\nWHAT?!\nPhoenix:\nWHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! L-Larry! I can't believe you--! ......Well, anyway, good job! If we compare the photos of the first and second receptions and can find a difference... ...then we'll be able to prove that the reception was held twice!\nJudge:\nBut do you really think such a difference exists?\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. I just need some time to find it for you.\nEdgeworth:\nThis is preposterous!\nJudge:\nVery well. Please show the court what's different, then.\nPhoenix:\nThis is proof positive that the wedding reception was held twice.\nPresent Ellen Wyatt's bouquet\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Please direct your attention to Ms. Wyatt's bouquet of flowers!\"\nPresent anywhere else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nHere it is! This is proof that the reception was held twice!\nJudge:\n...Where?\nPhoenix:\nRight here, Your Honor!\nJudge:\n........... ......Right where?\nPhoenix:\nUm... Right... not here, maybe?\nJudge:\nIt appears you've missed the mark, defense. I hope you take better aim next time before you fire off that mouth of yours!\nPhoenix:\n(But my aim is usually impeccable! I'd better take another good look at the two photos before I answer again, though!)\nLeads back to:\n\"This is proof positive that the wedding reception was held twice.\"\nPhoenix:\nPlease direct your attention to Ms. Wyatt's bouquet of flowers! In the photo one of her in-laws took, the defendant is holding a yellow bouquet. But in the photo Mr. Butz took, she is holding a red bouquet!\nMaya:\nY-You're right!\nEdgeworth:\n......That's... impossible!\nJudge:\nWh-What does this mean?\nPhoenix:\nIt means that the defendant really did experience two wedding receptions! And she did that... when she traveled back through time!\nJudge:\nWHAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!\nMaya:\nN-Nick! You did it! You proved Ellen's time travel story to be true!\nPhoenix:\nYeah... I can hardly believe it myself... (It's just as Ellen said -- the reception was held twice. This turns every assumption we've based this trial on upside down!)\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\n......I refuse to accept such a ludicrous argument! It is pure fiction under the guise of pseudoscience, at best! There is simply no such thing as time travel!\nPhoenix:\nI know it's hard, but can't you suspend your disbelief for one nanosecond, Edgeworth?\nMaya:\nI bet sci-fi movies push all your buttons the wrong way, don't they, Mr. Edgeworth...? I can totally picture you yelling, \"That'd never happen!\" every five seconds at the screen. Maybe you should stay away from movie dates altogether...\nEdgeworth:\nThat's neither here nor there! This is real life we're talking about!\nJudge:\nBut the proof is clearly shown in the two photographs.\nPhoenix:\nThat's right, Mr. Edgeworth, no matter how inexplica--\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nFine. I'll entertain your absurd delusion... ...if only to demolish it before your very eyes!\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nEdgeworth:\n......Let's start with this, then, shall we? There is one thing your time travel theory fails to explain. And that is the memories of the other guests there. The defendant and Larry remember the reception occurring twice... ...but no member of the Sprocket family has even mentioned such a thing.\nPhoenix:\nThat's because the time machine is classified technolog--\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nI'm not done, you birdbrain!\nPhoenix:\nB-Birdbrain?!\nEdgeworth:\nAs I was saying, if the entire family had been sworn to secrecy... ...then why hadn't they sworn the woman who was marrying into the family to secrecy, too?\nPhoenix:\nTh-That's a good point...\nEdgeworth:\nHonestly. All it takes is a little common sense, Mr. Wright.\nJudge:\nHmm... Even still... ...how do we know that the trip through time did not really occur? There is proof in the photos that it did. And besides, if time travel doesn't exist, well... ...I'd be a little disappointed, frankly. I was hoping to go back to the days of my youth--\nEdgeworth:\nYou mustn't allow yourself to be taken in by Mr. Wright's whimsical tales, Your Honor. I've read about it in various literature, you see... And they all say that time travel is just not logically feasible.\nPhoenix:\nNnnnngh...\nMaya:\nHmm... Maybe our argument was just a little too nonsensical, Nick...\nPhoenix:\n......Well, in that case... ...why don't we put \"common sense\" to the test?\nEdgeworth:\nExcuse me?\nPhoenix:\nThe wedding reception was held twice. The photos are proof of that. But it wasn't because of time travel. It's simply because the reception had actually been held twice. Isn't that the most reasonable way to interpret the situation?\nJudge:\nHmm... Would you care to elaborate, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(If time travel doesn't exist, then there's only one way to make sense of what happened!) Somebody must've orchestrated this strange phenomenon. And that somebody is...\nEveryone at the reception\nLeads to:\n\"What if all of the guests at the reception conspired together...\"\nGloomsbury\nPhoenix:\nMr. Gloomsbury!\nJudge:\n......Hm?\nEdgeworth:\nAnd how exactly did a dead man orchestrate such an event? And more importantly, why?\nPhoenix:\nW-Well, it was... ...to make it look like Mr. Sprocket had been successful in his research...?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat are you asking me for?! Besides, none of the other people interviewed... ...thought that he had succeeded in accomplishing time travel!\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor, could we rewind time... by just a teeny bit?\nJudge:\nSorry, but no.\nPhoenix:\n(I'd better rethink this quick, before I lose any more time, too.)\nLeads back to:\n\"Somebody must've orchestrated this strange phenomenon. And that somebody is...\"\nThe gods\nPhoenix:\nSuch a mysterious phenomenon could only have been caused by... ...the gods themselves!\nJudge:\nHmm... I suppose the gods would be able to rewind time... ...or make the wedding reception happen twice, wouldn't they?\nPhoenix:\nIndeed they would, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nIn that case, Mr. Wright... ...please bring these gods here to testify before this court.\nPhoenix:\nUm, Maya...? Do you think you could...?\nMaya:\n...Not a chance.\nJudge:\nOn behalf of the gods who can't be here today, please, have some divine punishment.\nPhoenix:\n(I knew I was reaching with that one... I guess I'd better come up with something more grounded next time...)\nLeads back to:\n\"Somebody must've orchestrated this strange phenomenon. And that somebody is...\"\nPhoenix:\nWhat if all of the guests at the reception conspired together... ...to hold the reception twice and keep quiet about it?\nEdgeworth:\nWhat? ......And for what purpose would they conspire to do such a thing?\nPhoenix:\n......Well, uh... ..................\n*clap clap clap clap*\n???:\nHa ha ha! A brilliant deduction, defense.\nNichody:\nI can tell that you are not a renowned lawyer for nothing. I must say, I underestimated you.\nPhoenix:\nHow so, Mr. Nichody?\nNichody:\nYou have managed to name each event, precisely as they happened. You have revealed it all to the light of day.\nPhoenix:\nTh-Then, that means...\nNichody:\nIt was us. We orchestrated the whole thing. Yes, the reception was held twice. But not because of time travel, no -- we simply held it a second time.\nEdgeworth:\nWH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Why?! Why would you do such a thing?!\nNichody:\nTo make it as though the murder Miss Ellen committed... never happened.\nEdgeworth:\nNnngh!\nNichody:\nMaster Sorin figured that if Miss Ellen, who'd killed Gloomsbury after the first reception... ...experienced the reception one more time, she would think it was all a dream. It was he who ordered us to make it happen. However, only a few, myself included, knew of Miss Ellen's crime.\nJudge:\nAre you saying most of the guests attended two receptions without knowing why?\nNichody:\nIndeed. They needed no reason... Master Sorin told them to do it, and do it they did. That is the Sprocket way.\nPhoenix:\nThen who hid the body in the lantern?\nNichody:\nWe did. But we did not anticipate the petals finding their way in, nor the actions of Mr. Butz.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd that's how you intended to cover the whole situation up?!\nNichody:\nThere is just one thing everyone here has wrong. The real scene of the murder was not the hold. It was the vista deck.\nPhoenix:\nWhat?! Th-Then Ms. Wyatt's recollection of the events must be correct!\nNichody:\nI admit we tried to cover this incident up. But the fact that Miss Ellen killed Gloomsbury is undeniable.\nJudge:\nThis is quite a turn of events!\n???:\n......... ......Heh heh heh.\nEdgeworth:\nAnd so it appears we have arrived at the truth at last.\nPhoenix:\nNow, now...\nEdgeworth:\nPlease do feel free to travel back in time, Mr. Wright... ...and attempt to do this trial over again. Go on.\nPhoenix:\nLet's not get hasty, Edgeworth...\nEdgeworth:\nI bet you can't do it!\nPhoenix:\nI bet I can't, eeeeeiiiither!\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor, we will have to hold a separate trial for the cover-up conspiracy later. But as far as this case goes... ...I believe we are ready for your ruling.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nJust before the defendant lost consciousness during her attack... ...she says she saw someone strike the victim. It's possible that this third party is the true culprit!\nEdgeworth:\nEdgeworth:\nYou still want us to believe the defendant's words? Perhaps you've lost more than your touch during your time abroad. This \"third person\" nonsense is nothing but rubbish, and you know it!\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nBut, by the same token... ...how can we trust those who conspired and lied to fool this court of law? For all we know, they might still be hiding something!\nEdgeworth:\nNrgh... You never know when to quit, do you?!\nJudge:\nNow, now. Calm down, both of you. In any case, there isn't enough trustworthy information yet for me to render a verdict. I suggest we continue the trial after both sides have investigated the matter further.\nEdgeworth:\n......Nnnnrrrrgh. Very well, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\n(Phew! That was close...)\nJudge:\nMr. Nichody... As for you and your cohorts' attempt to cover up this crime... ...your case will be brought to a separate trial following the resolution of this current one.\nNichody:\nUnderstood, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nWell, then... This concludes today's trial. Court is adjourned!\nTo be continued\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor, I have a feeling this piece of evidence contradicts the witness's statement!\nJudge:\n...A \"feeling,\" defense?\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor... Or, rather, a \"hope\" that it indicates a contradiction...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. Is there or isn't there a contradiction here?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like there is... but there really isn't one, is there?\nJudge:\nAre you asking me, Mr. Wright? Because what it really seems like to me is you're asking for a penalty!\nPhoenix:\nThanks for that definitive answer, Your Honor...\nEdgeworth:\n*sigh* With a lawyer like you, Mr. Wright, even I feel bad for the defendant.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, you don't have to feel bad for her for long! I'll get it right next time, you'll see!)\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor, the witness's statement contains a glaring contradiction! And this is the piece of evidence that says it all! ............. ...............\nJudge:\n...Will it start saying something anytime soon, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\n............ ............ ...It's not speaking up at all, is it? Maybe it's being shy?\nJudge:\n...... Your evidence has said nothing at all to this court. But your choice of tactics speaks volumes about you, defense!\nMaya:\nEven I knew that wasn't a very smart move, Nick...\nPhoenix:\nArrrngh...\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThe witness's statement is inconsistent with this piece of evidence!\nEdgeworth:\n...Mr. Wright. Would you care to tell this court what percent sure you are of your claim?\nPhoenix:\nWhy, of course! I'm a hundre--! Well, er... ninety... Wait, maybe eighty-ish...? W-Would you accept... fifty percent?\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! I won't have such half-hearted bluffing in my courtroom!\nEdgeworth:\nYour Honor. Might I recommend that the defense be penalized with one-hundred-percent severity?\nJudge:\nOh, I intend to, Mr. Edgeworth! You can be sure of that!\nPhoenix:\nNngh... (Guess I can't say I deserved zero percent of that...)\nConsult (when evidence must be presented)\nPhoenix:\nSo, what do you think we should do now, Maya?\nMaya:\nThat one statement sounds awfully fishy to me, Nick.\nPhoenix:\n...Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.\nMaya:\nSo now it's just a matter of deciding which piece of evidence to present, right?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. I'll take another look at the evidence and compare it to that statement, then.\nConsult (when statements must be pressed)\nPhoenix:\nSo... what now?\nMaya:\nWell, you can press the witness some more... ...and try and get new information out of them, right?\nPhoenix:\nRight. (Guess I'd better get down to pressing the witness, then.)\nToo many penalties\nJudge:\nThat's enough! I see no need to further prolong this trial. The defense's case is insufficient to overturn the prosecution's claims! This court finds the defendant, Ellen Wyatt...\nGuilty",

We've got some more questions.\nSound the alarm! Prisoner 201's escaped!\nRebel 1:\nWell, you know, with Datz back on the streets, things'll be on the up and up for us.\nRebel 2:\nKeep your voice down! You WANT that rebel hunter to find us or something?\nRebel 1:\nCome on. We're small fries compared to--\nAaaagggh!\nMay 9, 3:30 PMTehm'pul Temple\nPhoenix:\nAhh... Another fine day in the Kingdom of Khura'in. ..................... It's so peaceful here... (I can't believe it's been two weeks already, but... ...this place is really starting to grow on me. Still... It sure was a rough start. Now, to do what I came here to do: To see Maya! Her long ascetic training is finally coming to an end. But before it does, she said something about one last rite she has to perform today.)\n???:\nMr. Wright!\nAhlbi:\nHap'piraki!\nPhoenix:\nHey, Ahlbi. Hap'piraki.\nAhlbi:\nOh, you've mastered the traditional greeting of Khura'in!\nPhoenix:\nI-I don't know about that... (But I guess all that practicing is paying off!)\nAhlbi:\nHave you gotten used to life at the temple?\nPhoenix:\nI'm grateful they're letting me stay here, but the mornings start a little too early for me.\nAhlbi:\nHa ha ha! Yes, well, morning prayers do begin at dawn! After all, you can never pray too much! Daily devotion is very important here in Khura'in!\nPhoenix:\nHats off to you guys. I don't know how you do it.\nAhlbi:\nAnd today's a special day, full of even more prayer than usual! There's nothing better in this world than being able to pray to your heart's content!\nPhoenix:\n(I... can think of a few things I'd rather do...) So, what makes today so special anyway?\nAhlbi:\nYou mean you don't know?! Today's the Purification Rite! It's only performed once a year!\nPhoenix:\n(That's what Maya must've been talking about on the phone yesterday. I wonder what her role in it is...) ...So, what exactly is Maya going to be doing for this \"Purification Rite\"?\nAhlbi:\nWhat?! Didn't she tell you?! She's playing the role of Lady Kee'ra! It's only the most important part of the entire rite! It's unprecedented to have a foreigner play such a key role!\nPhoenix:\nWow, that's really something.\nAhlbi:\nIt really is! Helping out such an amazing person... ...has been the greatest honor of this humble tour guide's life!\nPhoenix:\nSo, who is this \"Lady Kee'ra\" you mentioned?\nAhlbi:\nAllow me to explain! Once upon a time, hundreds upon hundreds of years ago... ...there lived a female warrior who fought valiantly to establish the Kingdom of Khura'in.\nPhoenix:\nLet me stop you right there!\nAhlbi:\n...Is something wrong?\nPhoenix:\nNo, it's just... I get the feeling I'm in for a really long story.\nAhlbi:\nYeah... I'd say it normally takes around two hours to tell.\nPhoenix:\n(Whew, dodged a bullet there.)\nAhlbi:\n...Oh, right! You're supposed to finally see Miss Maya today! The story can wait, then. In the meantime, you can read up on the rite with this!\nPhoenix:\nAn English guidebook? Where did you dig this up from?\nAhlbi:\nI found it just lying there in the temple library. I figured no one's using it, so I borrowed it!\nPhoenix:\nHm? Hey! This book belongs to Maya. See, there's her name on the back. Guess there's no harm in keeping this for a while, then.\nRites Guide added to the Court Record.\nAhlbi:\nMiss Maya should already be at the site where the rite is to take place. Let's go! ...To the Plaza of Devotion!\nPhoenix:\n(I wonder if Maya's matured any since I last saw her.)\nAhlbi:\nIt's on a mountaintop, so it might get a little cold, though!\nPhoenix:\nI think I can handle it.\nExamine\nTemple\nPhoenix:\n(I should offer a prayer now and then since they're letting me stay here. Hmm, let's see... May there be a slightly softer futon tonight. And may tomorrow's breakfast be a little bigger.)\nAhlbi:\nI'm impressed by your prayerful heart! Prayer is at the heart of Khura'inism, after all. May the Holy Mother's blessings be upon you!\nPhoenix:\nOh, uh... (Now I feel kinda bad...)\nBuildings\nPhoenix:\nWhat are those buildings over there?\nAhlbi:\nThose are training halls. Monks continuously undergo rigorous training there, day in and day out.  ...You could try it out for a day if you'd like. They do really interesting stuff -- like meditating while standing on their heads!\nPhoenix:\nTh-That's REALLY okay, Ahlbi! Thanks!\nWater\nPhoenix:\nThis is a really gorgeous spring.\nAhlbi:\nYou have an excellent eye for beauty, sir! This is the Guiding Waters -- the centerpiece of our temple tour! It's a sacred pathway for people's mitamah, so don't ever wade into it.\nPhoenix:\nWhy? What would happen if I did?\nAhlbi:\nI-I don't think we should even be talking about this. Just don't go in it, okay?!\nPhoenix:\n(What's the worst that could happen...? (B-But we're okay for now, right...? As long as we stay out of the water?)\nTalk\nAny ideas?\nAhlbi:\nThere have been a lot more tourists this year than last.\nPhoenix:\nThen your tour guide business must be booming.\nAhlbi:\nIt is! But I have more important things to do right now! Namely... helping you, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(I think I'll tip him a little extra for his help later...)\nWhat to do\nAhlbi:\nLet's head over to where the Purification Rite will be held.\nPhoenix:\nWhat sort of rite is it?\nAhlbi:\nUmm... We'd wind up missing a whole day of the rite if I were to explain it...\nPhoenix:\nIn that case, I think I'll just go see it for myself...\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nAhlbi:\nWooow! What a beautiful badge!\nPhoenix:\nIt's the attorney's badge we use in my country.\nAhlbi:\nIt kind of looks like a sunflower to me.\nPhoenix:\nYep, and I'm pretty sure there's even a reason for it.\nAhlbi:\nPlease do explain, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nM-Maybe next time. (I should've known he'd ask me to explain...)\nAnything else\nAhlbi:\nIs this... some sort of new tourist souvenir?!\nPhoenix:\nSorry, but no.\nAhlbi:\nOh...\nPhoenix:\nSorry to be such a disappointment...\nMay 9Plaza of Devotion\nPhoenix:\nBrrr... I-I-It's s-s-so c-c-cold... (It's like the air itself is made of ice.) But look at all these people...\nAhlbi:\nWell, this IS the day we come to offer prayers to Lady Kee'ra, the protector of our land. It's amazing to see how devoted everyone is!\nPhoenix:\nDevoted... Right... But couldn't they just as easily do all this praying someplace warmer?\nAhlbi:\nThis, too, is a part of our religious training! It helps us build strength of spirit and willpower! Further up, at the end of those stairs, is the Inner Sanctum.\nPhoenix:\nI see... Everyone I've met so far seems deeply religious.\nAhlbi:\nOf course we are! After all, Khura'in is also known as the Land of Prayer. It's said that we Khura'inese spend an average of fifteen hours a day in prayer.\nPhoenix:\nWhat?! F-Fifteen...?!\nAhlbi:\nFrom the moment we wake, to the moment we fall asleep, our hearts are always in prayer. You see all the square flags around here? They're known as prayer flags. They contain the prayers of our people!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, he's talking about these colorful strips of cloth. There's something written on each one.)\nAhlbi:\nSuch piety is the glory of our people, and...\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm afraid that story's going to have to wait for another time, Ahlbi... Maya should be here any minute now.\nAhlbi:\n...Oh, yeah, you're right! I can't wait to see Miss Maya again.\n???:\n...Pardon me, O noble traveler.\nAnime cutscene\n???:\nHow do you fare, Mr. Wright? It's been many a day.\nPhoenix:\nA-And, uh, who might you be? M-Maya?!\nAhlbi:\nMiss Maya! Hap'piraki!\nMaya:\nHap'piraki, Ahlbi. And you, Mr. Wright... May the Holy Mother guide you on your journey.\nPhoenix:\n.........Oh, um, thanks.\nMaya:\n...Hee hee! Long time no see, Nick! Well? Well? Did I surprise you with my act?!\nPhoenix:\n...Yeah, you can say that again. (This is Maya Fey. She's a spirit medium from Kurain Village back home. She was also my assistant for quite some time. ...But that was many years ago. Her ability to channel spirits saved me more times than I can count.)\nMaya:\nI sure miss those days. It was a ton of fun being the REAL boss of Wright & Co. Law Offices!\nPhoenix:\n(Now she's here, training to be the leader of Kurain Village and the master of her craft. Apparently, to become the master of the Kurain Channeling Technique... ...you have to train here in Khura'in, since this is where the technique originated.)\nMaya:\nDidn't I sound just like a pious nun when you saw me just now?! Too bad that's about all I learned from all the training I did.\nPhoenix:\nHa ha ha. You haven't changed a bit, Maya.\nMaya:\nHuh? And what's THAT supposed to mean?\nPhoenix:\n(She may look a little more mature on the outside, but inside, she's the same old Maya. ...I'm actually kind of glad for that.)\nExamine\nFlags\nPhoenix:\n(Ahlbi said these are called prayer flags. And the prayers written on them are carried throughout the kingdom by the wind. Now, if I were to pray for something... ...it would be for me to not get dragged into any more trouble than I already have been.)\nGate\nPhoenix:\nWhat a magnificent gate. You can tell it leads to someplace sacred like the Inner Sanctum.\nMaya:\nSadly, only holy people are allowed through there. And here I am, hoping to show you just how amazing I've become during the rite today. All of that spiritual power I built up during my training is going to rush out like a raging river!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah... Just try not to overdo it, okay?\nPraying people\nPhoenix:\nWow... No one's moved a muscle.\nAhlbi:\nThose people will stay in that position and pray for two days straight, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nTwo days straight?\nMaya:\nGlad I'm not them! AND that I get to be Lady Kee'ra!\nPhoenix:\n(M-Maya...! Don't be rude!)\nMaya:\nYou just hang in there, Nick. It's only two days, after all!\nPhoenix:\nI don't recall signing up for this part of the tour...\nMaya:\nYou know what they say: \"When in Rome\"!\nPhoenix:\n(Now I understand the saying, \"There's no place like home.\")\nTalk\nMaya\nMaya:\nI heard what happened, Nick! You ended up in court almost as soon as you got off the plane, huh.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, well, it's kind of a long story.\nAhlbi:\nI was the accused! But you should've seen Mr. Wright in action! He was amazing!\nPhoenix:\nAh ha ha ha ha...\nMaya:\nHmm... I bet it was another one of your famous seat-of-your-pants, come-from-behind wins, huh.\nAhlbi:\nW-Well... I WAS almost found guilty any number of times.\nPhoenix:\n(Okay, so it wasn't my finest hour. So sue me.)\nMaya:\nYou haven't changed a bit, either, Nick.\nPhoenix:\n(Ouch. It definitely stings more when it's coming from her...) So, I guess you've finished the bulk of the training needed to become the master, right?\nMaya:\nOh, you mean the \"Special Meditation Course for Increasing Spiritual Power\"? Yep! I've completed the full two years! I can finally go home once I perform the Purification Rite today!\nPhoenix:\nActually, I was wondering why they're having a foreigner conduct one of their sacred rites.\nMaya:\nWell, the high priest's wife usually conducts it each year... ...but with her baby on the way, it's just more than she could handle. So the high priest practically begged me to stand in for her this year.\nPhoenix:\nWell, you may not know all of their customs, but with your training, I'm sure you'll do great.\nMaya:\nYou bet! Just you watch, Nick! I'm going to be the best Lady Kee'ra: Guardian Diety [sic] ever!\nPhoenix:\nI'd better throw in a few prayers for things to not end in a flaming disaster, then.\nGuardian deity (appears after \"Maya\")\nPhoenix:\nSo about that guardian deity you'll be portraying today... What exactly are we talking about here?\nMaya:\nWell, first of all, Lady Kee'ra isn't really a deity in the way we think of them back home. She's a real person who fought to establish the Kingdom of Khura'in a long, long time ago.\nPhoenix:\n(Wow, so she actually existed.)\nMaya:\nAnd now the kingdom's people worship her as a guardian deity. They believe she appears to protect the kingdom whenever it's in danger. Cloaked in a sacred robe, she's a champion of justice who defeats the kingdom's enemies!\nPhoenix:\nThat sounds like something you'd be into.\nMaya:\nI know, right?! Who wouldn't want to be a kick-butt warrior who takes on evil with a wicked dagger?\nPhoenix:\nR-Right... Whatever floats your boat. Still, Lady Kee'ra must really be a popular deity if all these people are here for her.\nMaya:\nYep. But there's more to it than just her popularity this year!\nPhoenix:\n(There's more?)\nThe rite's popularity (appears after \"Guardian deity\")\nLeads to:\n\"So, why's this rite attracting such a large crowd this year?\"\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nMaya:\nOh, hey! Congrats on getting your badge back, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nThanks, Maya.\nMaya:\nNow you can go back to a life of bold-facedly bluffing the day away, everyday!\nPhoenix:\nThat's...  not exactly why I returned to the courtroom, you know...\nRites Guide\nMaya:\nHey! That's mine!\nPhoenix:\nWell, it was just sitting there in the temple's library, so Ahlbi sorta checked it out for me.\nMaya:\nHope it comes in handy, then! Oh, and by the way... the Maya Library of Guidebooks has a $2-a-day \"donation\" policy.\nPhoenix:\n...I guess Ahlbi's entrepreneurial spirit is contagious.\nPhoenix:\nSo, why's this rite attracting such a large crowd this year?\nMaya:\nBecause there's been actual sightings. You know, of the real deal.\nAhlbi:\nAllow me to explain! A mysterious figure clad in Lady Kee'ra's robes appeared, just like in the legends. And she began capturing members of the Defiant Dragons right and left!\nPhoenix:\nY-You're kidding, right?\nAhlbi:\nThey say it's only a matter of time till she gets their leader, the revolutionary Dhurke, too!\nPhoenix:\n(So Lady Kee'ra's a rebel hunter now, huh...) It's a bit hard to swallow though. I mean, even if they are trying to disrupt the peace... ...I doubt the actions of a band of rebels can bring a legendary figure back to life.\nMaya:\nI didn't believe it at first, either. But there's a real picture of her on the front page of today's newspaper! Sightings of her go back about two years... ...but this is the first actual picture of her to ever be taken!\nPhoenix:\n(I can't believe someone was able to actually capture her on film...) But couldn't this just be some Lady Kee'ra fan? You know, like you, Maya?\nMaya:\nYou mean like a cosplayer? Those rebels are no joke, Nick! They're trained in hand-to-hand combat and stuff! You think some regular cosplayer can take on people like that dressed in a costume, alone? That's why she HAS to be the real deal! It gives me chills just thinking about it! I bet Lady Kee'ra's spirit possessed the sacred robe or something!\nPhoenix:\nA spirit possessing a piece of clothing...? Umm... Maybe you should cut back on all those action-superhero shows, Maya.\nMaya:\nHey! What's that supposed to mean?! You're just jealous that I'm still young at heart! \"I've got a real office to run now, so I've gotta keep it real,\" right?\nPhoenix:\n(I don't know who you're talking about, but that's definitely not me.)\nMaya:\n*sigh* You've really lost your edge since I last saw you. Those spikes of yours have grown really dull... and there's even one that's drooping!\nPhoenix:\n...Can we leave my hair out of this?\nMaya:\nAnyway! I swear that the Lady Kee'ra people have been spotting is the REAL DEAL! Besides, it's just so much more fun to believe it's true, you know?\nPhoenix:\nI can't believe you really buy all that... (Although... I wonder who's under that robe.)\nMay 9th Newspaper added to the Court Record.\nAhlbi:\nBut, Mr. Wright! She's the talk of the town! She even gave me this great new food idea! It's gonna be like a soul bun, but based on Lady Kee'ra! I'm calling it the \"Kee'ra Bun\"!\nPhoenix:\nT-Talk about a \"Kee'ra\" business strategy... Come on, Maya. Just admit it's you running around dressed as Lady Kee'ra already.\nMaya:\n! .................. Hee hee hee hee hee hee. I guess the jig is up!\nAhlbi:\nWhat?! I-Is it really true, Miss Maya?!\nMaya:\nIndeed! It is I... Lady Kee'ra! After hundreds of years, I have returned in this lovely young lady's body!\nAhlbi:\nWhaaaaaaaaaaaat?!\nMaya:\nOnly a minion of the Defiant Dragons could see through my disguise! Now... feel my wrath, foul lawyer! Hi-yah!\nPhoenix:\nOWWW!\nAhlbi:\nM-Mr. Wright!\nMaya:\n...Just kidding! I mean, come on. I may be dressing up as Lady Kee'ra for the rite today... ...but there's no way I could ever beat up one of those rebel-types!\nPhoenix:\n(I don't know... That was a pretty solid left hook she just threw.)\nAhlbi:\nO-Oh! You were just trying to be funny! You really had me going there for a second!\nPhoenix:\n(No one can be THAT naïve, right...?) Well, I hope you enjoy playing superhero at the rite today.\nMaya:\nOoh, when you put it that way! I'm even more hyped about it now than I was already!\n*jangle* *jangle*\nMaya:\nOh, I hear the sound of the high priest's footsteps. I'd better get going.\nPhoenix:\nHis footsteps?\nMaya:\nDuring the rite, he wears these really big bells on his ankles. That way I know he's coming. Pretty handy, right? Well, see you later!\nPhoenix:\n(I doubt they're actually meant to be a \"stop slacking\" warning system for you, Maya...)\nAhlbi:\nMiss Maya is always so bright and cheerful!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I'm glad to see she hasn't changed. (As in, at all... I wonder if this means her training's been all for naught... I hope not.)\nAhlbi:\nAh, it's Acolyte Zeh'lot.\nPhoenix:\nAcolyte Zeh'lot...?\nAhlbi:\nLook, he's the one praying in the red and saffron robe. He's a disciple of the high priest, Abbot Inmee, and lives and trains at his house. See how he prays in the cold without moving a muscle?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, I could never do that...\nAhlbi:\nAh, it's Abbot Inmee! The Purification Rite is about to begin!\nPhoenix:\nSo that's the sacred robe Maya will be wearing during the rite. It looks almost exactly like what that figure in the newspaper photo was wearing. (Whoever it is must've worked really hard to copy it.)\nAhlbi:\nPlease, sir, it's not a good idea to stare like that. You could be struck blind!\nPhoenix:\nJust give me a few more seconds. I mean, this isn't something you see every day... ...Oh, those bells on the high priest's ankles... they're a lot bigger than I thought they'd be.\nAhlbi:\nMr. Wright! It's time to enter the prayer pose like everyone else. Those who don't will suffer the wrath of the Holy Mother!\nPhoenix:\nOkay, let's see... First, I kneel down and cross my ankles, and then I bow forward... Youch! Great... Now all I can see is the ground, and my back is killing me!\nAhlbi:\nYou really should have trained for this, sir...\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait a sec... How long are we supposed to stay like this, Ahlbi?\nAhlbi:\nThe rite requires that we stay like this... until the day after tomorrow.\nPhoenix:\nTh-That's two whole days! Nngh... I don't feel so...\nAhlbi:\nM-Mr. Wright! Are you okay, sir?! S-Somebody, heeelp!\n???:\n...ster... Wri... Mist... ...ight? Mister Wright! Please, you have to get up!\nPhoenix:\nUgh... Ouch, my aching...! ...Hm? Ahlbi...? Where are we?\nAhlbi:\nThe high priest's house at the foot of the Plaza of Devotion!\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I passed out from that back pain. They must've carried me all the way here.)\nAhlbi:\nSomething terrible's happened! It's Miss Maya! She's... She's... Ooh, just follow me to the Plaza of Devotion!\nPhoenix:\n(Something must've happened while I was passed out.)\nAhlbi:\nMiss Maya's... She's been arrested!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What?!\nMay 10, 8:00 AMPlaza of Devotion\nPhoenix:\n*huff* *puff* (Where's Maya?)\nPoliceman:\nJust take it easy, all right!\nMaya:\nB-But I'm telling you! I-I... I haven't done anything wrong!\nPoliceman:\nHmph. You can talk all you want back at the station.\nMaya:\nL-Let me go!\nPhoenix:\nMaya!\nMaya:\nNick! I didn't kill him! I swear I didn't!\nPoliceman:\nQuiet, you! Come along peacefully or suffer the consequences!\nPhoenix:\nW-W-Wait a second! What on earth is going on?!\nPoliceman:\nI don't know who you are, but if you don't get out of my way--!\n???:\nHey! Back off, officer!\nPhoenix:\nE-Ema? Ema Skye?! (What's she doing in Khura'in?)\nEma:\nI'm so sorry, Mr. Wright... but we're placing Maya under arrest. All right, take her down to the station! But with respect -- got it?!\nPoliceman:\nYes, ma'am!\nMaya:\nN-Niiiiiiiiiiiiiick!\nEma:\n...............\nPhoenix:\nSo, what are you doing in Khura'in, Ema?\nEma:\nIt's a long story. Anyway, what are YOU doing in Khura'in, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nSame here -- it's a long story. But we can get caught up later. Right now, I need to know what happened.\nEma:\nMaya's... well... under arrest for the murder of the high priest.\nPhoenix:\nWait, the high priest was... murdered?\nExamine\nGate\nPhoenix:\nThat's a befitting gate for the path to the Inner Sanctum.\nEma:\nIt's apparently considered a sacred object to the people of Khura'in. I wasn't even allowed to dust it for prints.\nPhoenix:\nSo, even applying a little fingerprint dust to it would be sacrilegious, huh.\nEma:\nI guess so... But I applied some luminol on it instead when no one was looking!\nPhoenix:\nSounds like an invitation for the Holy Mother to strike you down later, Ema.\nPraying people\nPhoenix:\nWow... Even with the murder, all these people are still here, praying.\nEma:\nThey're so into it, they wouldn't notice anything you did to them.\nPhoenix:\nYou mean like... taking their fingerprints?\nEma:\nHuh?! Oh, um, who would ever do something like that?\nPhoenix:\nEma... You didn't...\nZeh'lot\nPhoenix:\nAcolyte Zeh'lot is really in the zone.\nEma:\nOh, you mean that monk who's been living at the victim's home? Yeah, he hasn't moved a muscle, even though his teacher has been murdered.\nPhoenix:\nI guess he's so deep in prayer, he's not aware of what's going on around him.\nTalk\nWhat happened?\nPhoenix:\nWhat happened, Ema? Please, tell me everything you can.\nEma:\nWell, basically, here was a murder during the rite as it was being performed last night. The victim is Tahrust Inmee, the high priest who was presiding over the rite.\nPhoenix:\nWait, hold on! \"Last night\"...? You mean to tell me, an entire day's passed since the Purification Rite?\nAhlbi:\nThat's right, sir. You passed out for a whole day from your back pain.\nPhoenix:\n(I never knew my back's like a ticking time bomb... I'd better take better care of it.)\nEma:\nThe murder took place at the Inner Sanctum where the rite was being held.\nPhoenix:\nThe Inner Sanctum...\nAhlbi:\nIt's the place where the spirit of Lady Kee'ra is enshrined! It's through that gate over there and up at the top of the mountain stairs just beyond!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, so that's why everyone is offering their prayers in that direction...)\nAhlbi:\nAbbot Inmee and Miss Maya went up to the Inner Sanctum to begin the rite... ...just after they finished the prayer you fainted in the middle of.\nPhoenix:\nSo, who do you think killed the high priest?\nEma:\nUnfortunately, Maya is our sole suspect right now. During the rite, the Inner Sanctum was off-limits to the general public.\nPhoenix:\nSo then, only the high priest and Maya could have been there when the murder occurred?\nEma:\nRight. Plus, the Inner Sanctum is on the side of a very steep mountain. The only way up there is the stairway that starts here at the Plaza of Devotion.\nPhoenix:\n(So that's why she's been arrested.)\nEma:\nAlso, the crime scene was only discovered after Maya came down alone. She's the one who told the worshippers in the plaza that the high priest was dead. ...And she made a police statement to that\neffect.\nPhoenix:\n(So she was the first one to discover the body... Well, that definitely doesn't help. That makes it even less likely that someone else was there at the crime scene.)\nAhlbi:\nMr. Wright, sir... Are you going to defend Miss Maya?\nPhoenix:\nYes, of course. There's no way she killed anyone.\nAhlbi:\nY-Yeah! I don't believe it, either! She's been framed! But this is really something else, huh, Mr. Wright? I mean, who'd have thought you'd have to take on that horrible court again?\nPhoenix:\n(Tell me about it. I never thought I'd have to go through another trial... ...where the Divination Séance determines all, and defense lawyers are unwelcome.)\nEma (appears after \"What happened?\")\nPhoenix:\nSo, what brings you here, Ema?\nEma:\nBack in the U.S., I was working a case with an international prosecutor from Khura'in. He told me this is where I could see the latest techniques in international forensic science. I can't believe I fell for it! I mean, just look at this place. It's like we've gone back in time!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, I can't say I've been impressed with the police work I've seen so far...)\nEma:\nStill, he said he takes on cases from around the world... ...so maybe next time, he'll have one in a major city somewhere.\nPhoenix:\nSounds like this prosecutor has taken a liking to you, Ema. After all, it's not every day a prosecutor takes a detective with them overseas.\nEma:\nI wonder... He's calm, and kind, and almost always has a smile on his face... ...but it's hard to tell what he's really thinking.\nPhoenix:\nThis international prosecutor... Is he the one who handled Trucy's case?\nEma:\nYes, he is!\nPhoenix:\nI take it he'll be the prosecutor on this one, too?\nEma:\nYes, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi's already been assigned...\nAhlbi:\nP-Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?! Pohlkunkaaa!\nPhoenix:\nYou know him, Ahlbi?\nAhlbi:\nOf course! Everyone in Khura'in does. He's a highly revered individual, both as a prosecutor and a monk! If you go up against Prosecutor Sahdmadhi... you'll incur the Holy Mother's wrath!\nPhoenix:\nBut it's my job to, as a lawyer...\nAhlbi:\nOh, right! Sorry...\nPhoenix:\n(Just great... A prosecutor who's also a revered monk in a deeply religious country... This trial's shaping up to be even more uniquely Khura'inese than the last one.)\nEma:\nI'm not sure I should be saying this, but he's a formidable opponent.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I heard Apollo had a really tough time, so I'd better give it everything I've got. Anyway, I'm glad you're here, Ema. They treat lawyers like criminals here.\nEma:\nCome to think of it, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi mentioned something to that effect. I'm not sure how much I can help, but I'll do what I can!\nPhoenix:\nReally? Are you sure you aren't going to get in trouble for helping \"the enemy\"...?\nEma:\n*gulp* He did come down on me pretty hard when I tried to help Trucy in that last trial... .................. Let's just say... I'll help where I can!\nPhoenix:\nTh-Thanks. But don't go getting yourself in trouble on my account, okay? (Prosecutor Sahdmadhi sounds pretty strict.)\nEma:\nSo, first things first. Let's start with this. Hot off the press, it's the high priest's autopsy report!\nTahrust's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.\nEma:\nThe victim bled to death from a deep stab wound to the abdomen. The murder weapon is believed to be Lady Kee'ra's Warbaa'd Dagger. It's used during the rite, however, the dagger has yet to be found.\nPhoenix:\nLady Kee'ra's dagger, huh... (I think Maya mentioned something about a dagger...)\nMaya:\nWho wouldn't want to be a kick-butt warrior who takes on evil with a wicked dagger?\nPhoenix:\nR-Right... Whatever floats your boat.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... And isn't that rebel hunter posing as Lady Kee'ra also armed with a dagger? Of course, hers must be a replica, right?) Would it be okay for me to go take a look at the crime scene, Ema?\nEma:\nThe police have already wrapped up their investigation... ...but the location itself is off-limits to the general public, so I'm not sure.\nPhoenix:\nEma, please! I'm begging you! Just like the police, I need access if I'm to mount a viable defense.\nEma:\n...All right, then. Leave it to me! I'll explain the situation to Prosecutor Sahdmadhi and the police later.\nPhoenix:\nThanks, Ema!\nEma:\nYou have quite a climb ahead of you, so be sure to watch your step!\nPhoenix:\n...Wait, you're not coming with me?\nEma:\nO-Oh, no, I'm not climbing up there again. No way.\nPhoenix:\nI-Is it really that bad? I wonder if my back can handle it...\nAhlbi:\nYou get to go to the Inner Sanctum?! Oh, you're so lucky, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nWhy don't you join me, Ahlbi?\nAhlbi:\nTh-Th-That's crazy talk, sir! If a commoner like myself were to set foot in there, I'd surely be cursed for all eternity!\nPhoenix:\nBecause the Inner Sanctum is off-limits for you, huh... Oh, well... Guess I'll just have to face this all by my lonesome. By the way, what about all the people still praying here? Aren't they going to go home?\nEma:\nThe customs of this rite require that they not move from this spot until tomorrow afternoon. It doesn't faze them to have police milling about. Some of them are even off-duty cops.\nPhoenix:\nWow, I guess this is what it's like to live in a deeply religious society, huh...\nEma (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nSo, what brings you here, Ema?\nEma:\nBack in the U.S., I was working a case with an international prosecutor from Khura'in. He told me this is where I could see the latest techniques in international forensic science. I can't believe I fell for it! I mean, just look at this place. It's like we've gone back in time!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, I can't say I've been impressed with the police work I've seen so far...)\nEma:\nStill, he said he takes on cases from around the world... ...so maybe next time, he'll have one in a major city somewhere.\nPhoenix:\nSounds like this prosecutor has taken a liking to you, Ema. After all, it's not every day a prosecutor takes a detective with them overseas.\nEma:\nI wonder... He's calm, and kind, and almost always has a smile on his face... ...but it's hard to tell what he's really thinking.\nPhoenix:\nThis international prosecutor... Is he the one who handled Trucy's case?\nEma:\nYes, he is!\nPhoenix:\nI take it he'll be the prosecutor on this one, too?\nEma:\nYes, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi's already been assigned...\nAhlbi:\nP-Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?! Pohlkunkaaa!\nPhoenix:\nYou know him, Ahlbi?\nAhlbi:\nOf course! Everyone in Khura'in does. He's a highly revered individual, both as a prosecutor and a monk! If you go up against Prosecutor Sahdmadhi... you'll incur the Holy Mother's wrath!\nPhoenix:\nBut it's my job to, as a lawyer...\nAhlbi:\nOh, right! Sorry...\nPhoenix:\n(Just great... A prosecutor who's also a revered monk in a deeply religious country... This trial's shaping up to be even more uniquely Khura'inese than the last one.)\nEma:\nI'm not sure I should be saying this, but he's a formidable opponent.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I heard Apollo had a really tough time, so I'd better give it everything I've got. Anyway, I'm glad you're here, Ema. They treat lawyers like criminals here.\nEma:\nCome to think of it, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi mentioned something to that effect. I'm not sure how much I can help, but I'll do what I can!\nPhoenix:\nReally? Are you sure you aren't going to get in trouble for helping \"the enemy\"...?\nEma:\n*gulp* He did come down on me pretty hard when I tried to help Trucy in that last trial... .................. Let's just say... I'll help where I can!\nPhoenix:\nTh-Thanks. But don't go getting yourself in trouble on my account, okay? (Prosecutor Sahdmadhi sounds pretty strict.)\nEma:\nSo, first things first. Let's start with this. Hot off the press, it's the high priest's autopsy report! The victim bled to death from a deep stab wound to the abdomen. The murder weapon is believed to be Lady Kee'ra's Warbaa'd Dagger. It's used during the rite, however, the dagger has yet to be found.\nPhoenix:\nLady Kee'ra's dagger, huh... (I think Maya mentioned something about a dagger...)\nMaya:\nWho wouldn't want to be a kick-butt warrior who takes on evil with a wicked dagger?\nPhoenix:\nR-Right... Whatever floats your boat.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... And isn't that rebel hunter posing as Lady Kee'ra also armed with a dagger? Of course, hers must be a replica, right?)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nEma:\nCongrats on your return to the legal world! I wanted to congratulate you sooner, but I never had the chance.\nPhoenix:\nThanks, Ema. And congratulations to you, too, on becoming a forensic investigator.\nEma:\nHeh heh, thanks. Oh, I know! Let's celebrate by dusting your attorney's badge for fingerprints! Or how about we do a luminol test on it?\nPhoenix:\nI think I'll pass on both, but thanks.\nTahrust's Autopsy Report\nEma:\nThe victim's name was Tahrust Inmee. He bled to death from a stab wound in the abdomen.\nPhoenix:\nAnd the killer?\nEma:\nAt the moment, our only suspect is the person who was with the victim at the time.\nPhoenix:\nIn other words, Maya.\nAnything else\nEma:\nIt's been ages since you've presented evidence to me.\nPhoenix:\nRemember when we worked that one case together? I seem to recall a thin layer of fingerprint powder on every piece of evidence then...\nEma:\nW-Well...! I guess they get that way from time to time now, too...\nPhoenix:\nAs enthusiastic as ever, huh, Ema.\nTehm'pul Temple\nExamine\nTemple\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not a Khura'inist, but maybe if I prayed with all my might... ...the Holy Mother will help me... Who am I kidding? I have to figure out how to solve this case myself.)\nBuildings\nPhoenix:\n(I can hear the monks' prayers all the way over here. Maybe the Holy Mother would answer mine if I slipped it in with theirs. Here goes... \"Please let me save Maya Fey!\")\nWater\nPhoenix:\n(I look a little haggard in my reflection. It's like the water's showing me how I feel on the inside... ...Wait, what am I doing?! I have to stay strong, especially for Maya.)\nTalk\nAny ideas?\nAhlbi:\nI still can't believe there was a murder during the Purification Rite... Could it have been an act of divine justice by Lady Kee'ra?\nPhoenix:\nDivine justice, huh... (We wouldn't need a trial if that's what it was.)\nAhlbi:\nOh, no! Maybe I'm next for coming up with my \"Kee'ra Buns\"! P-Please, Lady Kee'ra! I meant no disrespect!\nPhoenix:\nUm, I don't think that's a terrible enough of a crime to be divinely punished for, Ahlbi...\nWhat to do\nAhlbi:\nWe don't have time for chit-chat, Mr. Wright! We have to prove Miss Maya's innocence!\nPhoenix:\nYeah. Let's hurry back to the Plaza of Devotion.\nMay 10Detention Center\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like Maya is still being questioned. I'll just have to come back again later.)\nExamine\nBell\nPhoenix:\nThere's a bell here. I wonder if it's for calling the guard.\n*jingle, jingle*\nGuard:\nDon't do that unless you need something, you lawyer!\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry! (I didn't even get to say anything!)\nGuard\nPhoenix:\n(Why does that guard keep eyeballing me? I can't let him get to me... I can't let him get to me... Ack! He's doing it again!)\nAfter clearing \"Ema\" Talk option in Plaza of Devotion:\nMay 10Inner Sanctum\nPhoenix:\nBrrrr... I-It's really high up, and really, really c-c-cold. What did I do to deserve this? At least I made it. I'd better get started while I can still feel my fingers. (...Hm? Who's that? It kind of looks like...)\nExamine\nRayfa Padma Khura'in\nLeads to:\n\"Umm... excuse me.\"\nAny other point of interest\nPhoenix:\n(.........Hmm. I should probably at least say hi to her before I start my investigation... Not that I want to, but...)\nPhoenix:\nUmm... excuse me.\nRayfa:\nAh! It's you...! Do you even know where you are, Barbed Head?\nPhoenix:\nOf course, I do. May I ask why you're here, Your Benevolence?\nRayfa:\nI came to pray for the high priest's soul. But what are YOU doing here? This is one of the most sacred spots in Khura'inism! Unscrupulous lawyers such as you have no business being here!\nPhoenix:\nBut I'm not \"unscrupulous\"...\nRayfa:\nQuiet! You dared to find fault with my Insights at every turn the other day!\nPhoenix:\n(She's STILL sore about that trial...?)\nExamine\nRayfa:\nHm? Why do you keep looking away?\nPhoenix:\nI was thinking about investigating the crime scene...\nRayfa:\nWell, you can do so later! You are speaking with me right now!\nPhoenix:\n(As you wish, Princess... I guess the investigation will have to wait until she's done talking at me.)\nMove\nPhoenix:\n(If I turn back now, I'll have to climb all the way back up here again later... *sigh* Guess I'll have to make Princess Rayfa see things my way somehow...)\nTalk\nInvestigating the incident\nPhoenix:\nAs you know, Your Benevolence, a murder has occurred, and I need to investigate--\nRayfa:\nBut we know the killer is one of your own!\nPhoenix:\nIn my country, suspects are innocent until proven guilty. Plus, she is a serious student of spirit channeling who came here to study. So, can't you at least give her a chance to explain what happened?\nRayfa:\nAll practitioners from overseas are big... big... phony baloneys! And her wish to train in the homeland of spirit channeling is but a bid for prestige.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh. It seems like nothing I say will convince her otherwise, thanks to that last trial. Tweedledum and Tweedledee really did a number on her impression of foreigners.)\nThe defense (appears after \"Investigating the incident\")\nPhoenix:\nAs the defense attorney on this case... ...I really need to investigate this crime scene -- and I need to do it now. I've even been authorized by the police, so...\nRayfa:\n...What's this?! Y-You intend to make a mockery of our sacred Hall of Justice once more?\nPhoenix:\nN-No, I simply want to defend my client.\nRayfa:\nWhich means, you have come to forge evidence, then! I knew all lawyers were criminals! I must now redouble my vigilance!\nPhoenix:\nOuch, that's unfair. Who taught you to demonize a whole group of people anyway?\nRayfa:\nMy mother and father! Do you have an issue with their parental guidance?!\nPhoenix:\nN-No... I would never dare criticize the royal couple... (I still can't imagine what the lawyers here must've done to garner such hatred...)\nRayfa:\nHmmmmm ............... Oh, ho! Heh heh heh. I just had the most wonderful idea, Barbed Head.\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I have a bad feeling about that glint in her eye?)\nThe most wonderful idea (appears after \"The defense\")\nLeads to:\n\"So... what's this most wonderful idea of yours?\"\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nRayfa:\nHm?! What is that badge you bear?\nPhoenix:\nIt's a sunflower pin. They're quite popular in my country.\nRayfa:\nHmm... It IS rather cute, I must say.\nPhoenix:\nActually, it's just my attorney's badge.\nRayfa:\nOh? So you mean it would have actually been worth more as a cheap accessory?\nPhoenix:\nM-My profession is worth more than $1.20, you know.\nRites Guide\nRayfa:\nThat is a book from your land, is it not?\nPhoenix:\nYes, it's a guidebook about Khura'in that was written by people back home.\nRayfa:\nOh? So there are people in your land who know of our fair kingdom. Then I imagine it must say something about me in there, correct?\nPhoenix:\nActually, yes. It says the Dance of Devotion is performed by an adorable little princess...\nRayfa:\nH-How dare they write of me as though I were a child!\nPhoenix:\nHey, I'm just reading what it says... (Though, she does seem secretly pleased...)\nTahrust's Autopsy Report\nRayfa:\nWhat a dreadful way to die...\nPhoenix:\nDid you know the high priest, Your Benevolence?\nRayfa:\nYes, he was a pious priest of Khura'inism. As such, he had the trust of the entire kingdom.\nPhoenix:\nThe entire kingdom...? Really?\nRayfa:\nYes. But what do you know of faith and trust? You, who can never hope to match his virtue. It is like comparing the moon to a pebble, or the sea to a puddle!\nPhoenix:\n(How did this suddenly become a game of \"Pin the Diss on the Lawyer\"?)\nAnything else\nPhoenix:\nA dahma for your thought?\nRayfa:\nUgh! Get that thing away from me!\nPhoenix:\nAll right, I'll just put it away, then.\nRayfa:\nWho told you to put it away? How am I to inspect it if you do that?!\nPhoenix:\n(Keep it out, put it away -- I wish she'd make up her mind...)\nPhoenix:\nSo... what's this most wonderful idea of yours?\nRayfa:\nIf you are to investigate this murder... ...then I shall oversee your every move, so as to prevent any misdeeds, naturally.\nPhoenix:\nWhat?! You want to follow me around the entire time?!\nRayfa:\nOf course. Not that I want to, mind you. And I will not tolerate any objections, understood?!\nPhoenix:\nSh-She can't do this to me...\nRayfa:\nWhat was that, Barbed Head?\nPhoenix:\nOh, n-no! It's nothing!\nRayfa:\nVery well, then. Let us get this investigation over with. We mustn't stay here in the Inner Sanctum a moment longer than necessary.\nPhoenix:\nP-Please don't rush me.\nRayfa:\nIt is not without reason that I insist on a speedy investigation, Barbed Head. I am a direct descendant of the Holy Mother, you see, who guides the people of Khura'in. As such, I must not sully myself with the blood of battle that Lady Kee'ra bears.\nPhoenix:\n(The blood of battle...?) If it's that big of a problem, why don't you head on down now? I won't do anything, I promise.\nRayfa:\nNo. Lawyers are never to be trusted! Now, make haste, so that we may leave here soon! ...Oh, and one more thing!\nPhoenix:\nWh-What now?\nRayfa:\nYour victory the other day was but a stroke of fortune! But this time, my Insights shall reveal the absolute truth! So brace yourself for a defeat most bitter, lawyer!\nPhoenix:\nI-I will. Now can I get on with my investigation?\nRayfa:\nAs long as you know where we stand.\nPhoenix:\n(*sigh* I'd better hurry up and poke around for clues before she changes her mind...)\nExamine\nWall painting\nPhoenix:\nWhat an amazing wall painting! So this is Lady Kee'ra...\nRayfa:\nDo you see that red mark upon her brow? That is the character for death in Khura'inese. It is a mark of resolve to fight to the end. There are many different marks we make on our bodies, each with a different meaning.\nPhoenix:\nHmm, interesting... Come to think of it, you have marks on your face, Your Benevolence. So did the high priest. (Changed from [Come to think of it, Your Benevolence has marks on your face. So did the high priest.] in the original release)\nRayfa:\nThe high priest's marks are those of a monk, while mine are of a royal priestess. All members of the Khura'inist clergy have such marks upon them. The shape and location of the marks vary in accordance to conditions like status and age. And all records about them are kept at Tehm'pul Temple.\nPhoenix:\nSo it's kind of like a national ID registry, huh.\nTahrust's Autopsy Report updated in the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nIs that a weapon in her hand?\nRayfa:\nYes, it is Lady Kee'ra's dagger -- the very same one used in the rite. It is made to resemble a warbaa'd, the bird Lady Kee'ra fashioned herself after.\nPhoenix:\n(So that dagger is the weapon that took the high priest's life...)\nRayfa:\nIf you wish to know more about Lady Kee'ra, you need but ask.\nPhoenix:\n(I get the feeling she's going to be super relevant to this case... I should definitely ask the princess for more details later.)\nWall painting (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nThis wall painting really is amazing, no matter how many times I look at it.\nRayfa:\nDo you see that red mark upon her brow? That is the character for death in Khura'inese. It is a mark of resolve to fight to the end.\nPhoenix:\nHmm, interesting... Come to think of it, you have marks on your face, Your Benevolence. So did the high priest. (Changed from [Come to think of it, Your Benevolence has marks on your face.

The shape and location of the marks vary in accordance to conditions like status and age. And all records about them are kept at Tehm'pul Temple.\nPhoenix:\nSo it's kind of like a national ID registry, huh. Is that a weapon in her hand?\nRayfa:\nYes, it is Lady Kee'ra's dagger -- the very same one used in the rite. It is made to resemble a warbaa'd, the bird Lady Kee'ra fashioned herself after.\nPhoenix:\nSo that dagger was the murder weapon, huh...\nMountain face\nPhoenix:\n(This mountain face is like a towering wall. There are characters carved into it,  but I have no idea what they mean.)\nRayfa:\nThere is a prison at the apex of this mountain.\nPhoenix:\nA prison? Way up there?\nRayfa:\nIt is said that Lady Kee'ra laid those she defeated to rest atop this mountain... ...so that their souls would not spawn evil spirits.\nPhoenix:\nI'm feeling queasy just thinking about being all the way up there... (And the fact that it's a prison just makes it worse.)\nCurtain\nPhoenix:\nDuring the rite, the Inner Sanctum was fully enclosed by this ritual curtain... ...making this case something of a locked-room mystery.\nRitual Curtain added to the Court Record.\nRayfa:\nThe Purification Rite is akin to a bathing ritual for Lady Kee'ra. Therefore, it must be closed off from the outside world.\nPhoenix:\nOh, so the Inner Sanctum is like her private bathroom.\nRayfa:\nIndeed. So see to it that you keep it clean.\nPhoenix:\n(This flap in the center acts as the ritual curtain's door, but that's about it.) Eek!\nRayfa:\nAnd what was that shrill scream for just now?\nPhoenix:\nI-It's just... I'm afraid of heights. (I didn't notice it as I was climbing up, but now that I can see all the way down... *gulp*) I guess that flight of stairs from the Plaza of Devotion really is the only way up or down...\nCurtain (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nDuring the rite, the Inner Sanctum was fully enclosed by this ritual curtain... ...making this case something of a locked-room mystery.\nRayfa:\nThe Purification Rite is akin to a bathing ritual for Lady Kee'ra. Therefore, it must be closed off from the outside world.\nPhoenix:\nOh, so the Inner Sanctum is like her private bathroom.\nRayfa:\nIndeed. So see to it that you keep it clean.\nFront of bird statue or spring\nPhoenix:\nLet's take a closer look, shall we?\nBird statue\nPhoenix:\nWhoa! (Th-This is blood!)\nRayfa:\n.........This is a statue of a warbaa'd, the bird on which Lady Kee'ra based her appearance.\nPhoenix:\nAnd all of this blood is from the high priest, huh...\nRayfa:\nHe no doubt embraced the statue in the hope that Lady Kee'ra would save him from death. May his soul rest in peace.\nPhoenix:\nConsidering the amount of blood, he must've been stabbed with considerable force. But there's no way Maya would be strong enough to deliver such a blow.\nSpring or body outline\nPhoenix:\nIt's been stained red by the high priest's blood.\nRayfa:\n\"The spring shall run red upon Lady Kee'ra's return.\"\nPhoenix:\nWhat's that from?\nRayfa:\n...An old legend.\nPhoenix:\n(Wait. Does that mean... ...that the rebel-hunting Lady Kee'ra in the newspaper is the real deal? ...Nah. That's crazy talk.)\nLady Kee'ra robe\nPhoenix:\nHey, isn't this Lady Kee'ra's robe?\nRayfa:\nO Holy Mother! Lady Kee'ra's robe is...!\nPhoenix:\nI know how you feel, but we should leave it as is to preserve the crime scene.\nRayfa:\nYou imbecile! This is the actual robe Lady Kee'ra once wore!\nPhoenix:\nI-It is?! What the heck is it made of? I mean, nothing should look this good after a few hundred years!\nRayfa:\n...............Enough! If I say it's the actual robe, it IS the actual robe! That foul murderer shall not get away with this!\nPhoenix:\n(It is tough to see a piece of history sloppily tossed on the ground like this, though... It even looks like it's been mended a number of times.) ...Hm? This robe kinda smells...\nRayfa:\nHow dare you insult such a sacred piece of clothing like that?!\nPhoenix:\nN-No, I meant that it smells like incense.\nRayfa:\n...Oh, I see. The scent you detected is from the sacred incense used to purify Lady Kee'ra's robe. Whenever a rite is to be performed, the robe is first scented with sacred incense.\nPhoenix:\n(If this still smells like incense now... ...the scent must have been much stronger last night when the victim was killed.)\nBloody paper\nPhoenix:\nA bloodstained scrap of paper... Looks like some kind of note or letter, perhaps? But it's written in Khura'inese, so I can't read a lick.\nRayfa:\nLet me see that. \".........once the flame is lit, then......... ...........................will be...\" This is simply impossible to read! ...Wait!\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it?!\nRayfa:\nThis stamp in the lower right! It's the mark of those insurgents -- the Defiant Dragons!\nPhoenix:\nThe rebel group?! (What's it doing here? Is there some kind of a connection between the high priest and the rebels?)\nBloodstained Letter added to the Court Record.\nAfter examining bird statue, spring or body outline, Lady Kee'ra robe, and bloody paper:\nPhoenix:\nLooke like that about does it for this area.\nLeft side of bird statue\nPhoenix:\nIt's a statue of a bird... Guess I'll take a closer look at it.\nStatue's missing eye\nPhoenix:\nLook, the bird's missing its eye. I feel sorry for the poor fella.\nRayfa:\nAre you the one who took it?!\nPhoenix:\nOf course not!\nRayfa:\nHmph. This statue has been here for ages. I suppose some damage is to be expected. I shall ask my mother to have it repaired.\nPhoenix:\n(No wonder there are no lawyers left. I'd leave, too, if I were always treated like this.) I don't think I'll find anything else of interest around here.\nStatue's missing eye (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nLook, the bird's missing its eye. I feel sorry for the poor fella.\nRayfa:\nAre you the one who took it?!\nPhoenix:\nOf course not!\nRayfa:\nHmph. This statue has been here for ages. I suppose some damage is to be expected. I shall ask my mother to have it repaired.\nPhoenix:\n(No wonder there are no lawyers left. I'd leave, too, if I were always treated like this.)\nSnowdrift or broken lantern\nPhoenix:\nI think I'd better go take a closer look.\nGap in snowdrift\nPhoenix:\nThere's no snow here. Maybe it was removed because it would interfere with the rite?\nRayfa:\nThe day before the rite, the temperature in this area plunged below freezing. Even the Plaza of Devotion was covered in a layer of white frost.\nPhoenix:\nMust be the elevation. It wasn't all that cold back in town, as I recall.\nBroken lantern\nPhoenix:\nThis lantern is damaged. (The wind guard is completely broken.)\nRayfa:\n...Damaged? Was this your doing?!\nPhoenix:\nN-N-No! I didn't even touch it!\nRayfa:\nHmph! Then perhaps a falling rock struck it. I will request that it be repaired when we are finished here. Of course, I doubt you will live long enough to see it restored.\nPhoenix:\nI-I'll be back to take a look! You'll see!\nAfter examining gap in snowdrift and broken lantern:\nPhoenix:\n(The snow has obviously been cleared away here, and the lantern is broken. I still have that camera I brought to take pictures of my trip. I should snap one of this area here just in case.)\nInner Sanctum Photo added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\n(Nothing else particularly interesting here.)\nAny intact lantern\nPhoenix:\nIt's a lantern. ...Hm? And it's still lit.\nRayfa:\nOf course it is. The sacred flames in the four lanterns here have burned for centuries. Anyone who extinguishes even one of them would be put to death immediately.\nPhoenix:\n(So that's why they're outfitted with glass wind guards. Still, I'd better keep my distance... Just in case.) So the moon and these lanterns were the only sources of light up here that night?\nRayfa:\nThe rite is performed by the light of the full moon because moonlight is a purifying force.\nPhoenix:\nI see...\nRayfa:\nNo touching!\nPhoenix:\nI-I wasn't going to!\nStone slab\nPhoenix:\nThis rock must've fallen from higher up on the mountain. It's like the perfect perch for taking a peek over that curtain... Well, up I go! Wow, what an incredible view! It almost... boggles the mind...\nRayfa:\nGet down from there this instant!\nPhoenix:\nR-Right! Sorry! I'll be right down. (It looks like the Inner Sanctum is just slightly higher up than the top of that mountain.) ...I guess that confirms that the stairs from the Plaza of Devotion is the only way up here.\nStitched prayer flags\nPhoenix:\nHm? There's something hanging off of the ritual curtain there... These look like those prayer flags down at the Plaza of Devotion.\nRayfa:\nExcept, they are arranged like no prayer flags I have ever seen.\nPhoenix:\nHow so?\nRayfa:\nAll of these flags have been sewn together.\nPhoenix:\nHey, you're right. It's like they're one big banner now.\nRayfa:\nThere is something written on a piece of it... \"Donated by Tahrust Inmee\"... It seems this piece is from a donation Abbot Inmee made at some point.\nSanctum Prayer Flags added to the Court Record.\nStitched prayer flags (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nHm? There's something hanging off of the ritual curtain there... These look like those prayer flags down at the Plaza of Devotion.\nRayfa:\nExcept, they are arranged like no prayer flags I have ever seen.\nPhoenix:\nHow so?\nRayfa:\nAll of these flags have been sewn together.\nPhoenix:\nHey, you're right. It's like they're one big banner now.\nRayfa:\nThere is something written on a piece of it... \"Donated by Tahrust Inmee\"... It seems this piece is from a donation Abbot Inmee made at some point.\nBack of broken lantern\nPhoenix:\nThat lantern looks broken, but it's hard to make out the details from this angle. I'll take a closer look when I'm in a better spot.\nTalk\nInner Sanctum\nPhoenix:\nCould you tell me about this place, Your Benevolence?\nRayfa:\n...I have nothing to say to you, lawyer.\nPhoenix:\nIs that because you don't actually know much about it...?\nRayfa:\nYou ill-mannered--! I am the crown princess of Khura'in! There is nothing I do not know! ...Nayna!\nPhoenix:\n(Whoa! Where'd she come from?!) ...Hey! No cheating!\nRayfa:\nSilence, Barbed Head! Nayna's knowledge is my knowledge. End of discussion.\nPhoenix:\n(What is she, your pocket internet?)\nRayfa:\nThis spring is where Lady Kee'ra came to cleanse her body of the blood of battle. And today's Purification Rite is a ceremony that traces its origins back to those days. Cleansing Lady Kee'ra's robe in this sacred water lends one courage for the next battle.\nPhoenix:\nI-I see. Thank you for that excellent explanation.\nRayfa:\nCommoners are normally barred from here, except for the day of the rite.\nPhoenix:\nWho normally controls the access to this place?\nRayfa:\nThe high priest and his family are responsible for that.\nPhoenix:\nThe high priest and his family, huh...\nThe high priest's family (appears after \"Inner Sanctum\")\nPhoenix:\nCould you tell me about the high priest and his family?\nRayfa:\nAbbot Inmee lived with his wife and his disciple, Acolyte Puhray Zeh'lot... ...a young man the couple took into their home upon finding him near our kingdom's border.\nPhoenix:\nSpeaking of his wife, isn't she the one who usually plays the role of Lady Kee'ra?\nRayfa:\nYes, but as she is with child, the role was appointed to someone else. The killer no doubt offered to stand in, as she saw it as a chance to slay the high priest.\nPhoenix:\nNo, you have it backwards. He was the one who asked Maya to stand in.\nRayfa:\nThen that braggart must have embellished her qualifications.\nPhoenix:\nI'm really not sure how she could. Besides, why didn't you stand in for the high priest's wife, then?\nRayfa:\nDid I not tell you before? As a direct descendant of the Holy Mother, the role of Lady Kee'ra is forbidden to me. For those descended of Her Holiness must not defile their bodies with the blood of battle.\nPhoenix:\nOh, yeah... You did say that, didn't you? (I should probably talk with the high priest's wife and Acolyte Zeh'lot later, too.)\nLady Kee'ra (appears after examining wall painting)\nPhoenix:\nUm, so could you tell me more about this Lady Kee'ra?\nRayfa:\nAs an outsider I suppose your ignorance is all but unavoidable.\nPhoenix:\n(Whatever happened to \"you need but ask\"?!)\nRayfa:\nNayna! Lady Kee'ra was the Holy Mother's younger sister. But unlike her older sister, she lacked the ability to channel spirits. However, it is said that none could equal her skill with the dagger.\nPhoenix:\nA dagger? Well, this became relevant fast.\nRayfa:\nThe Holy Mother guides our souls, and Lady Kee'ra keeps the peace with her dagger. Lady Kee'ra was prepared to die for her people. She cloaked herself in a sacred battle robe, and concealed her face as her sister did.\nPhoenix:\nOkay, but who was she fighting against?\nRayfa:\nThroughout our history, we have been set upon by rebels... Now is no different. For our enemy now is the Defiant Dragons, led by that insurgent Dhurke.\nPhoenix:\nSo Lady Kee'ra played a role akin to the police, huh? So what's with the bird imagery?\nRayfa:\nLady Kee'ra's robe is fashioned in the likeness of a warbaa'd. It is a fearsome bird that is unique to Khura'in.\nPhoenix:\nI see... And what about the recent rebel hunter Lady Kee'ra? Who do you think she is?\nRayfa:\nI have heard about her, but I have yet to ascertain the truth. However, I believe her to be a vigilante -- or more precisely, a patriot.\nPhoenix:\n(So even Princess Rayfa doesn't know the true identity of the rebel hunter, huh?)\nAfter clearing all Talk options and examining mountain face, curtain, bird statue, spring or body outline, Lady Kee'ra robe, bloody paper, statue's missing eye, gap in snowdrift, broken lantern, any intact lantern, stone slab, and stitched prayer flags:\nPhoenix:\n(That about does it for the Inner Sanctum... Hmm... I should probably head back to the Plaza of Devotion, and let Ema know I'm done. After all, she's the one putting her neck on the line for me to investigate this place.)\nDetention Center\nExamine\nBell\nPhoenix:\nThe guard will come over if I ring this, right?\nRayfa:\nHmph. I have no need for such an implement. .........Guard!\nGuard:\nYes, Your Benevolence?! It is my honor to be at your service!\nRayfa:\nNow, you try it, Barbed Head.\nPhoenix:\nOh, uh... Okay.... Um, Mr. Guard? Could I please speak with you?\nGuard:\n.........Tsk!\nRayfa:\nIt seems he will not respond to a lawyer's call.\nPhoenix:\n(Somehow, I saw that coming a mile away.)\nTalk\nAny ideas?\nRayfa:\nThe killer must have been the one they call Maya Fey. There can be no other.\nPhoenix:\nY-You never know. It's still pretty early in the investigation.\nRayfa:\nHmph. She has spent time in the company of lawyers, so she must have a wicked soul.\nPhoenix:\n(Thanks for reminding me how much people like me are hated in this country...)\nRayfa:\nIt is only by the Holy Mother's mercy that you are allowed to investigate this sacred place. Remember that, and give thanks to Her Holiness for this great blessing at once!\nPhoenix:\nOh, um... Thank you, Your... Holy Motherness! (Er, that didn't come out right.)\nRayfa:\nThat seemed a little insincere. Shall we halt this investigation immediately?\nPhoenix:\nNo, wait! I'm grateful! Really!\nRayfa:\nHmm, I wonder...\nPhoenix:\n(Argh... This is going to be worse than walking on holy eggshells.)\nWhat to do\nRayfa:\n...Well? Are you going to conduct your investigation or not?\nPhoenix:\nI will! I-It's just... are you going to keep following me around like this?\nRayfa:\nOf course! Unless you intend to do something you feel the need to hide?\nPhoenix:\nN-No! I do everything by the book!\nRayfa:\nThen get on with it. I am not doing this for fun, you know. I, too, have many duties I need to attend to.\nPhoenix:\n(Then why don't you go do them instead of hovering over me?)\nRayfa:\nHm? What is that look you are giving me? Am I perhaps, being bothersome?\nPhoenix:\nN-No, don't be absurd! (You're being INCREDIBLY bothersome...)\nMay 10Plaza of Devotion\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... They're STILL praying!)\nRayfa:\nThe religious devotion of our people is the pride of our kingdom. Come what may, they will continue to pray until tomorrow afternoon.\nPhoenix:\n(Well, I will say this: This level of devotion is certainly to be respected...) Now, to find Ema.\n???:\nYou there! Wait. I want to ask ya something.\nPhoenix:\nO-Okay...\n???:\nDo ya know me? And do I know you?\nPhoenix:\nUm, well... I-I'm Phoenix. Phoenix Wright. I'm a lawyer.\n???:\nNo, no...! I wanna know if ya know who I am!\nPhoenix:\nH-Huh? How should I know? I've never even seen you before. (This guy's acting really strange. I wonder if he has amnesia or something? I should talk to him a little more, just in case he's connected to this case somehow.)\nTalk\nWho are you?\nLeads to:\n\"Um, are you having trouble remembering who you are?\"\nPresent\nAnything\n???:\nAh! M-My head...!\nPhoenix:\nA-Are you okay? (Did he remember something?!)\n???:\n...My head... is so itchy! Har har har har har har!\nPhoenix:\n(What is with this guy...?)\nPhoenix:\nUm, are you having trouble remembering who you are? Ack! I-I'm sorry if I offended you! (Whew! I thought he was going to pull a weapon on me! But he's just pulling some snack out one after another.)\n???:\nI'm trying to remember what I'm supposed to do. I know it's something important...\nRayfa:\nDo you know this man or something, Barbed Head?\nPhoenix:\nNo! I just said I've never seen him before, didn't I?!\n???:\n...Are you Lady Kee'ra?\nRayfa:\nYou know of Lady Kee'ra? Then you are Khura'inese, I take it?\n???:\n*chomp, chomp*... Maybe...?\nPhoenix:\n(Wait... Are those LIZARDS he's eating?!)\n???:\nWhat? Ya want one?\nPhoenix:\nN-No thanks! I, uh... I just ate!\n???:\nAh, now I remember! Get a load of this! ...Well?\nPhoenix:\n.........W-Well, what?\nRayfa:\n...I believe he suffers from a far more serious malady than mere memory loss.\n???:\n...No good, huh? Guess I'll try somebody else!\nRayfa:\nSo, who was that man, and what did he want, Barbed Head?\nPhoenix:\nI wish I knew.\n???:\nHey! Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nAck! What now?!\nEma:\nWhat's wrong? I didn't surprise you THAT badly, did I?\nPhoenix:\nOh, no, it's nothing. Actually, I've been looking for you. I wanted to tell you I investigated the crime scene. I hope it wasn't too much trouble getting my investigation of the Inner Sanctum approved.\nEma:\nOh, it was fine. Prosecutor Sahdmadhi gave his okay straight away.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, he seems like a rather fair-minded prosecutor.)\nEma:\nHe said that you would probably give up once you saw the crime scene for yourself. ...And that moving on before the trial began would be the smart thing to do.\nPhoenix:\n(.........He must be feeling really confident about his case.) Well, just so you know, I have no intention of giving up.\nEma:\nI figured! That's why I've prepared a little gift for you! I thought it might help your investigation. Here, it's all yours! I wanted to bring you a bunch of other forensic tools... ...but they were confiscated at the airport.\nPhoenix:\n(Luminol testing fluid... This actually might come in handy.)\nEma:\nAlso, I made a copy of the crime scene photo for you!\nPhoenix:\nThanks. All of this will definitely come in handy. (So this is what the high priest's body looked like after the murder... I'll keep this along with the picture I took at the crime scene.)\nInner Sanctum Photo updated in the Court Record.\nEma:\nOh, yeah! They're done questioning Maya.\nPhoenix:\nReally? I should go pay her a visit, then! (Poor Maya. She must be feeling pretty lonely. I should let her know that I'll be defending her, too.)\nEma:\nOh, shoot! Look at the time! I have to get going.\nPhoenix:\nYou sure seem busy.\nEma:\nThat's because His Ephemeral Holiness is a real slave driver.\nPhoenix:\n\"His Ephemeral Holiness\"...?\nEma:\nProsecutor Sahdmadhi. He's like the world's hardest riddle, wrapped in a flowy sash. I keep wondering if it's just a clash-of-cultures type of thing, you know? Like, he'll ask the most insane things of me without batting a single, long eyelash of his!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, this Prosecutor Sahdmadhi sounds like he's used to holding some serious clout...)\nEma:\nArgh! Why do I have such bad luck with prosecutors! First it was the glimmerous fop. And now that I'm finally rid of that grating, bling-loving Europhile, I get this guy! Oh, no! Now I'm really going to be late! He'll probably make me listen to one of those really long sutras again. I'll see you later!\nPhoenix:\n(He makes her listen to sutras? Sounds like Ema's got it pretty rough, too...)\nRayfa:\nShe does not appreciate Prosecutor Sahdmadhi's sutras? What ingratitude. It appears that she, too, is lacking in religious devotion.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think that's what the problem is here. Besides, Ema's not even a Khura'inist.)\nExamine\nGate\nRayfa:\n...To think I would witness a lawyer being allowed to pass through this sacred gate.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, well, I wouldn't unless I had to. Those stairs were brutal to climb...\nRayfa:\nWhat's this?! Do you even know how many monks would give their lives to pass through that gate?! Be thankful for the great honor you have been afforded!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Benevolence!\nPraying people\nPhoenix:\nThey're still praying? Now that's really something!\nRayfa:\nIt's called \"their absolute devotion to Lady Kee'ra.\"\nPhoenix:\nBut you don't have to pray to her, Your Benevolence?\nRayfa:\nOur customs dictate that I must never associate myself with Lady Kee'ra in any way. Instead, it is my duty to offer my prayers and dance to the Holy Mother every day. Why don't you try offering up a dance or two? I think you'll find it quite uplifting.\nPhoenix:\nN-No thanks! I'm good!\nPuhray Zeh'lot\nPhoenix:\nAcolyte Zeh'lot is still focused on his prayers.\nRayfa:\nIs not such devotion worthy of commendation? Still, he has not yet learned of the high priest's death. When I think of how he will learn of it once his prayers are over...\nPhoenix:\n...Yeah, it does seem cruel, doesn't it?\nTalk\nAny ideas?\nRayfa:\nThat man we just met... He seemed quite suspicious to me. Don't tell me he is an acquaintance of yours?\nPhoenix:\nNot everyone who's suspicious is friends with a lawyer, or vice versa, you know. For example, I have many upstanding friends and acquaintances, like a chief prosecutor.\nRayfa:\nWell, as long as your friends are free from the taint of corruption.\nPhoenix:\nThey are! (And not everything is about good and evil!)\nWhat to do\nRayfa:\nAre you going to speak with that woman?\nPhoenix:\nIf you mean Maya, then yes. There's something I need to talk to her about.\nRayfa:\nSomething like... a jailbreak?!\nPhoenix:\nAnd how exactly could we do that with you and a guard watching us like hawks?\nMay 10Detention Center\nMaya:\nNick! I knew you'd come!\nPhoenix:\n(Maya... She sure looks tired.) How are you holding up?\nMaya:\nIt wasn't me... But no one will believe me. Nngh...\nPhoenix:\nI have to admit, I'm still a bit in shock. Who'd have thought you'd get caught up in something like this? And so far from home? But I'm going to defend you, so hang in there. We can do this if we work together.\nMaya:\n.............................. Nngh... This is all my fault. I mean, you came to Khura'in just to visit me. We hadn't seen each other in ages, and then, this happens.\nPhoenix:\n(I haven't seen her this down in ages, either.) Come on! Remember who you're talking to. Besides, I'd thought you'd be used to being the usual suspect by now!\nMaya:\n! Ha ha ha... I guess you're right. And you've saved me each and every time.\nPhoenix:\nYup, so just tell me everything you can and let's go from there.\nRayfa:\nBarbed Head! Stop stalling and go straight to the matter of true import! We know she is the murderer! Therefore, it is time for her confession!\nMaya:\nY-Your Benevolence... What brings the royal priestess to a place like this?\nRayfa:\nI am watching over this lawyer to keep him from tampering with anything in this case. Now, out with it! Confess to your crime!\nPhoenix:\nP-Please, Your Benevolence. Could you please take it down a notch or three...?\nRayfa:\nHmph!\nPhoenix:\nMaya, please tell me what you can. I know this must be difficult, but anything you can remember might help.\nMaya:\nS-Sure, okay...\nTalk\nThe incident\nMaya:\nI didn't kill the high priest. I wouldn't even dream of it... I mean, he always treated me so well. Abbot Inmee was an important figure with a ton of duties, including training acolytes. He was really kind, even to a foreigner like me. He even invited me over to his house whenever I was between training sessions. How could I ever kill someone like that?!\nPhoenix:\nHe sounds like a really good person. (I think I would've liked him.)\nMaya:\nIt was so much fun. I got to enjoy meals with his family and everything. And his wife was a master of Khura'inese cuisine! I've never eaten better in my life!\nPhoenix:\n(It's like they were her family, and home away from home in this foreign land. They must've been a source of comfort, what with being here for training all alone.)\nMaya:\n........................... But...\nPhoenix:\nBut what?\nMaya:\n...I can't completely deny the charge, either.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?!\nRayfa:\nAs I suspected! The snake has shown her true colors at last!\nPhoenix:\nYour Benevolence, please! I'm trying to figure out what really happened here.\nRayfa:\nNngh... Hmph!\nPhoenix:\nSo, what do mean, you can't completely deny the charge?\nMaya:\nW-Well... during the Purification Rite... ...I suddenly got really, really sleepy. The next thing I knew, Abbot Inmee was... you know...\nPhoenix:\nYou suddenly got sleepy? So then, you didn't actually see the high priest get murdered?\nMaya:\nNo, I didn't, but... ...if I was possessed by some crazed spirit while I was asleep... then...\nRayfa:\nWhat an excuse. How dare you pin your crime on another person's soul?!\nMaya:\nNngh...\nRayfa:\nHmph. Be honest: What you call \"training\" is but an extended vacation in reality. And that \"training\" here is simply for prestige.\nMaya:\nN-No! It's not like that at all!\nTraining (appears after \"The incident\")\nMaya:\nI'm training to become the master of the Kurain Channeling Technique.\nRayfa:\nHmph. A neophyte practitioner such as you become a channeling master? I think not. The spiritual power required is beyond the means of an outsider like you.\nPhoenix:\n(Rayfa seems to really hate fakers... ...but Maya does actually have the power to channel spirits. I should let Rayfa know.) Your Benevolence. I wouldn't call Maya a neophyte, because... ...she can already cha--\nMaya:\nAhhh! Wait, wait, wait, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nWhat?!\nMaya:\nUmm... Can I talk to you for a second?\nPhoenix:\n(Why is she whispering all of a sudden?)\nMaya:\nI want to keep my spirit channeling ability a secret while I'm here, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWhat? Why?\nMaya:\nI'll, um... explain later. Just, keep it a secret for now, okay?!\nPhoenix:\nIf you say so... (What's that all about?)\nRayfa:\nWhat is all that whispering about over there?!\nPhoenix:\nOh, i-it's nothing, really. (I'll have to ask about this later when Princess Rayfa's not around.)\nMaya:\nOh, I almost forgot! Nick...\nPhoenix:\nYes?\nMaya:\nAbout Abbot Inmee's murder... There was something I noticed that I thought strange...\nPhoenix:\nOh...?\nWhat you noticed (appears after \"Training\")\nPhoenix:\nSo, what was it you noticed?\nMaya:\nWell... ...you probably won't believe me, but....\nPhoenix:\nWhy don't you let me be the judge of that.\nMaya:\nOkay... So, you know that spring?\nPhoenix:\nThe spring? You mean the pool in front of the warbaa'd statue?\nMaya:\nYes, that! The water in there... was dark red!\nPhoenix:\n............\nMaya:\nAnd when I say \"dark\" red, I mean \"blood\" red!\nPhoenix:\nOh, that? Yeah, I saw it, too.\nMaya:\nYou did?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. The high priest's blood turned it red.\nMaya:\nWhat? No, that's not what I meant! The spring was red before he was killed.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What? Wait, so it was already red? Even before the high priest was killed?\nMaya:\nYeah. I noticed it during the the Purification Rite -- just before I passed out. It's just like the ancient legend says...\nPhoenix:\nWhat \"ancient legend\"?\nMaya:\n\"The spring shall run red upon Lady Kee'ra's return.\" That's how it goes, anyway.\nRayfa:\nHold on! Yes, there is a legend about the Inner Sanctum that says just that. But the water runs red this time thanks to the murder. The police investigation confirmed it. Perhaps your eyes were deceived by the lantern light reflecting off of the water.\nMaya:\nI-I don't think that was it, though...\nPhoenix:\nAn ancient legend, huh...? I wonder if it's connected to this murder, somehow.\nMaya's Statement added to the Court Record.\nMaya:\n........................ Um, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYes?\nMaya:\nSo... Uhh... Actually, there's one more thing...\nRayfa:\n?\nPhoenix:\n(What's up with Maya? She keeps looking over at Her Benevolence, like she's worried what Rayfa will think.)\nWhat you noticed (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nSo, what was it you noticed?\nMaya:\nWell... ...you probably won't believe me, but....\nPhoenix:\nWhy don't you let me be the judge of that.\nMaya:\nOkay... So, you know that spring?\nPhoenix:\nThe spring? You mean the pool in front of the warbaa'd statue?\nMaya:\nYes, that! The water in there... was dark red!\nPhoenix:\n............\nMaya:\nAnd when I say \"dark\" red, I mean \"blood\" red!\nPhoenix:\nOh, that? Yeah, I saw it, too.\nMaya:\nYou did?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. The high priest's blood turned it red.\nMaya:\nWhat? No, that's not what I meant! The spring was red before he was killed.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What? Wait, so it was already red? Even before the high priest was killed?\nMaya:\nYeah. I noticed it during the the Purification Rite -- just before I passed out. It's just like the ancient legend says...\nPhoenix:\nWhat \"ancient legend\"?\nMaya:\n\"The spring shall run red upon Lady Kee'ra's return.\" That's how it goes, anyway.\nRayfa:\nHold on! Yes, there is a legend about the Inner Sanctum that says just that. But the water runs red this time thanks to the murder. The police investigation confirmed it. Perhaps your eyes were deceived by the lantern light reflecting off of the water.\nMaya:\nI-I don't think that was it, though...\nPhoenix:\nAn ancient legend, huh...? I wonder if it's connected to this murder, somehow.\nMaya:\n........................ Um, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nYes?\nMaya:\nSo... Uhh... Actually, there's one more thing...\nRayfa:\n?\nPhoenix:\n(What's up with Maya? She keeps looking over at Her Benevolence, like she's worried what Rayfa will think.)\nOne more thing (appears after \"What you noticed\")\nMaya:\nThere's... There's something I want to show you.\nPhoenix:\nThere is?\nMaya:\nI found this at the Inner Sanctum after I came to.\nPhoenix:\nIs this... a letter? (It's in Khura'inese...)\nMaya:\nSee that stamp on the far left, at the end of the letter? Does it look familiar?\nPhoenix:\n(This red stamp here?)\nMaya:\nThat's the mark of Lady Kee'ra.\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, right. It looks just like the mark on her forehead.)\nRayfa:\nL-Lady Kee'ra, you say?! Let me see that! ............... Wh-Why, this is...!\nPhoenix:\nWhat? What does it say?\nRayfa:\n...............\nMaya:\n\"Do not perform the rite. I know what you are planning. --Lady Kee'ra\"\nPhoenix:\nThat sounds like a threat -- or a warning! Whoever's pretending to be Lady Kee'ra was pressuring the high priest to stop the rite!\nMaya:\nYeah, that's what it looks like to me, too. Nick, do you think...\nPhoenix:\nWait, wait, wait, wait, wait! First, there's that ancient legend.\nMaya:\n\"The spring shall run red upon Lady Kee'ra's return.\"\nPhoenix:\nNow, there's also Lady Kee'ra's warning. Plus, with the Warbaa'd Dagger being eyed as the murder weapon... D-Don't tell me...!\nMaya:\nThat's why she HAS to be the real deal! It gives me chills just thinking about it! I bet Lady Kee'ra's spirit possessed the sacred robe or something!\nPhoenix:\nDon't tell me... ...you actually believe that the real Lady Kee'ra returned to kill the high priest?\nMaya:\n..................... Don't be silly, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMaya:\nHistorical figures don't come back to life. I mean, give me a break.\nPhoenix:\nB-B-But! You were saying only yesterday, how it was more fun to believe that she's the real deal.\nMaya:\nYeah, YESTERDAY! I wish I could keep on entertaining that fantasy, too... ...but the fact is, we're dealing with a murder here! Thus, my days of dreaming have come to an end.\nPhoenix:\n........................\nMaya:\nI'm going to keep it real from now on. And you should, too, Nick.\nPhoenix:\n(I thought you said I was the boring one because I was \"keeping it real\"...?)\nMaya:\nSorry, I guess I've outgrown that stepladder argument we always have...\nPhoenix:\nI think you mean \"ladder,\" Maya.\n\"Keeping it real\" (appears after \"One more thing\")\nLeads to:\n\"So, what do you mean by \"keeping it real\"?\"\nPresent\nTahrust's Autopsy Report or Inner Sanctum Photo\nMaya:\nI didn't kill the high priest! I swear!\nPhoenix:\nOf course you didn't.\nRayfa:\nAnd why should I believe the words of an accused?\nMaya:\nBut I really didn't kill him! And if you don't believe me, then prepare to get an earful! ...From Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWhat?! Keep me out of this!\nAnything else\nMaya:\nThere you go, presenting things left and right again, as always! Sure takes me back to the good old days! Ooh, ooh! Present something else, Nick!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh,  if that's what you really want...? At least it seemed to cheer her up a bit.)\nPhoenix:\nSo, what do you mean by \"keeping it real\"?\nMaya:\nOh, umm... So you know how someone is dressing up like Lady Kee'ra and capturing rebels, right?\nPhoenix:\nOh, you mean the rebel-hunter Lady Kee'ra in the papers?\nMaya:\nYeah, that one. I think that's who probably sent this warning.\nRayfa:\nWhat nonsense is this?! You dare to suggest... ...that Abbot Inmee was slain by Lady Kee'ra?! You... Youuu... nincompoop!\nMaya:\nEek!\nRayfa:\nThe rebel hunter is sure to be a vigilante who loves this kingdom. And it is that patriotism that led them to cloak their identity in the guise of Lady Kee'ra. Such a patriot... would NEVER slay the high priest!\nPhoenix:\n(I guess it's only natural for Princess Rayfa to see it that way, but I can't let it go at that...)\nRayfa:\nBesides, why would such a vigilante want to stop the Purification Rite in the first place?\nPhoenix:\n...I haven't figured that one out yet.\nRayfa:\nI rest my case!\nPhoenix:\n(Still, if this rebel hunter had a compelling enough reason... ...they might've killed the high priest after he ignored their warning.)\nRayfa:\nY-You... big dummy! You can't fool me! It was you who forged that warning letter! You are trying to shed your guilt onto our most sacred Lady Kee'ra! Admit it!\nMaya:\nN-No! I'd never do such a thing!\nPhoenix:\nNow, now, Your Benevolence. Let's try to remain rational about this...\nRayfa:\nGrrrrrrr...\nPhoenix:\nMaya, did you show that letter to the police?\nMaya:\nUmm... no. I was afraid that it would anger everybody needlessly. So I was waiting to show it to you, Nick.\nPhoenix:\n(And judging by Her Benevolence's reaction, I'd say Maya was right to be worried. ...Hm? Wait, what are... There are a number of places on this letter where there are three holes in a row. ...Are these supposed to be some sort of a message, too? Not that we'll be finding out any time soon, I suspect...)\nLady Kee'ra's Warning added to the Court Record.\nGuard:\nAll right, accused. Wrap it up.\nMaya:\nI guess they have more questions for me...\nPhoenix:\nYeah... At least I have a better idea of what we're up against now.\nMaya:\nUm, Nick...? There's something I've been meaning to say. I... don't need a lawyer this time.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What are you talking about?!\nMaya:\nIt's just, you know they have that Defense Culpability Act here in Khura'in, right? Well, if I'm found guilty... you'll be charged with abetting a criminal.\nPhoenix:\n(Maya... Thanks for thinking of me, but...) Don't worry, Maya. We'll pull through this together somehow. We always have, haven't we?\nMaya:\nYeah... But we're not in Kansas anymore, you know?\nPhoenix:\nTrue, but I've been through one trial here already. So I know what I'm getting myself into. We're going to win this one, no matter what. Because I believe in your innocence.\nMaya:\n! Yeah, I know... We've always won because of your faith in me.\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. So, it's \"All Aboard the Phoenix Freedom Express!\"\nMaya:\n...Thank you, Nick. Well, I'll see you later.\nRayfa:\nBravado will not save you tomorrow, and by then, it will be too late to ask for mercy.\nPhoenix:\n...We're going to beat this charge. You'll see.\nRayfa:\nHmph. I don't care to understand every single word that was spoken... ...but I don't like the sound of that \"Phoenix Freedom Express\" one bit.\nPhoenix:\nWait... Don't tell me you don't know what \"Freedom Express\" refers to?\nRayfa:\nAugh! Of course I know! D-Do not presume to know what I do not know! ........................\nPhoenix:\n(I'm no closer to understanding why someone would want the high priest dead... ...but given the use of the Warbaa'd Dagger and the existence of the warning letter... ...I'd say the rebel hunter disguised as Lady Kee'ra is the real prime suspect. It might help if I knew a little more about this modern-day Lady Kee'ra. I wonder if anyone has any info on them... Hmm... Maybe the first thing I should do is to go someplace where locals like to gather.)\nTalk\nAny ideas?\nRayfa:\nThat woman you call Maya Fey is not to be trusted. I hear she is already twenty-eight, and yet, she is still as antsy as a maiden in her teens. Surely, she must be hiding something!\nPhoenix:\n(Actually, that's... just Maya being Maya.)\nWhat to do\nPhoenix:\nSo, what next?\nRayfa:\nHmm, let me think... Oh, I know!\nPhoenix:\nD-Dare I ask...\nRayfa:\nAdmit the accused's guilt, so we can go straight to the inevitable guilty verdict! That will solve everything!\nPhoenix:\nWhy did I even ask...? I think I'll just keep on investigating.\nPresent\nLady Kee'ra's Warning\nRayfa:\nWhy is that warning letter comprised of paper cutouts?\nPhoenix:\nProbably because the author wanted to hide their identity. It's not a common technique these days, what with the spread of computers and printers.\nRayfa:\nW-We have such modern conveniences here in Khura'in, too!\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm sure you do. (Not that I've ever actually seen any of them.)\nMay 10Khura'in - Bazaar\nPhoenix:\nI guess the bazaar is as good a place to start as any. Now, who should I... ...Hm?\nRayfa:\nHmm, I see... So that is what a \"Freedom Express\" is...\nPhoenix:\n(Consulting her pocket internet again, I see...)\n???\nMr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nThat sounds like...\nAhlbi:\nIs Miss Maya okay? I believe her, Mr. Wright. I know she didn't do it!\nRayfa:\n...Do you now, boy?\nAhlbi:\nP-Pohlkunkaaa! Y-Y-Your Benevolence!\nRayfa:\nYou mustn't trust in lawyers, you... Hm? Are you not the accused from the last trial?\nAhlbi:\nOh, u-um...\nPhoenix:\nWhat's wrong, Ahlbi?\nAhlbi:\nY-Your... Your Benevolence speaks... with the... um...\nRayfa:\nYou may speak in the vernacular, little monk. Now, what is your name?\nAhlbi:\nY-Yes, Your Benevolence! Ahlbi Ur'gaid, Your Benevolence!\nRayfa:\nKnow this, Ahlbi: Your soul is only as clean or filthy as the company you keep.\nPhoenix:\n(I wish she'd stop insinuating that all lawyers are trash.)\nAhlbi:\nP-Please forgive me, Your Benevolence, but Mr. Wright is a very trustworthy man. A-And I... I trust him as a lawyer!\nRayfa:\n.........What's this?!\nAhlbi:\nI-I'm sorry! ...F-Forgive my insolence!\nRayfa:\nI-If a common boy such as he can place his trust in lawyers... ...it can only be because of my failure at the Hall of Justice the other day. Ooooooh...\nAhlbi:\nMr. Wright! Her Benevolence has sunken to the ground!\nPhoenix:\nShe must really feel responsible for what happened in court that day... Let's give her some breathing room for now. I'm sure she'll be back on her feet in no time. In the meantime, do you mind if I ask you some questions?\nAhlbi:\nOf course not! I'm always glad to help!\nExamine\nWarbaa'd\nAhlbi:\nAllow me to explain! This bird is known as a warbaa'd. It's only found here in Khura'in.\nPhoenix:\nOh, right -- the bird Lady Kee'ra based herself on. It's a really beautiful bird. Tourists must love it.\nAhlbi:\nThey usually do. There's just one thing about it that's kind of hit or miss. Its unusual cry drives children to tears. It can even make some adults collapse in fear...\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe they should keep such a fearsome creature in a less crowded area...)\nYak\nPhoenix:\nHey, Ahlbi, what's this cow-like animal?\nAhlbi:\nIt's a yak. They carry heavy loads and provide milk. They're indispensible partners in our daily lives.\nPhoenix:\nInteresting... Hey, they're kind of cute up-close!\nAhlbi:\nOh, and they are also prized for their meat. You know -- the meat you enjoyed so much last night.\nPhoenix:\nOh... (\"Partner\" must mean something else here.)\nProduce cart\nPhoenix:\nLook at all these vegetables...\nAhlbi:\nLet's see... There's giah'pam, konuuro, and zabaas. And they're all freshly picked this morning!\nPhoenix:\nI've never heard of any of them. Maybe I'll buy some to see what they taste like. You want some, too, Ahlbi? My treat.\nAhlbi:\nReally?! Thank you, sir! I'll take some of this, and this, oh, and this, too!\nPhoenix:\n.........Um, Ahlbi? That's quite a lot you've got there already, don't you think...?\nAhlbi:\nBut this is barely enough for a side dish!\nPhoenix:\n(I hope I brought enough money.)\nManhole\nPhoenix:\n(A manhole...? I guess they have a sewer system here in Khura'in. What am I thinking? Of course they do. That was ignorant of me...)\nPoster\nPhoenix:\n(It's a poster. It looks like some kind of Khura'inese superhero. Why do all superheroes look the same, regardless of where they come from?)\nSteaming buns\nAhlbi:\nThis is a really popular bun shop here in Khura'in!\nPhoenix:\nOoh, they even sell magatah'man. Let's see... \"1 magatah'man: 15 dahmas.\" ...Wait a second. Ahlbi, weren't you selling them for 20 dahmas apiece...?\nAhlbi:\nThe extra 5 dahmas is the service fee!\nPhoenix:\n(He's quite the shrewd businessman.)\nVertical sign\nPhoenix:\n(I can't read the sign, but this looks like a souvenir shop. It's too bad I don't have time to do some shopping right now... ...but I'll have to stop by here before I go back home. I'm sure everyone's expecting something... Especially Trucy.)\nGate or staircase\n(The gate to Tehm'pul Temple... And at the top of those stairs is my home away from home. Just looking at them is making my back ache.)\nMove\nPhoenix:\n(Rayfa's still sitting slumped on the ground. I can't leave her here like this... ...so I guess I should keep talking to Ahlbi until she recovers.)\nTalk\nThe rebel hunter\nPhoenix:\nSo what have you heard about the rebel hunter that was in the newspaper?\nAhlbi:\nEveryone's overjoyed at her appearance! They say she's the modern-day Lady Kee'ra!\nPhoenix:\n(So they're treating this rebel hunter like a mysterious protector of the people, huh.)\nAhlbi:\nPeople have been on edge recently, what with that jailbreak and stuff. I sure hope they catch that escaped prisoner soon!\nPhoenix:\nEscaped prisoner?\nAhlbi:\nYes, he was one of the vicious rebels that Lady Kee'ra had captured.\nPhoenix:\nSo there's a hardened criminal on the loose? That IS bad news.\nAhlbi:\nYes, but the modern-day Lady Kee'ra is also super amazing! I mean, she takes down big, scary rebels all by herself.\nPhoenix:\nYeah. That's not exactly something just anyone can do. (Someone that strong... ...could've easily overpowered and killed the high priest.) Hmm... And what about that escaped prisoner, Ahlbi?\nThe escaped prisoner (appears after \"The rebel hunter\")\nPhoenix:\nSo, what's the escaped prisoner supposed to be like?\nAhlbi:\nThey say he's a vicious fiend who serves as Dhurke's right-hand man.\nPhoenix:\nDhurke? As in the leader of that rebel group?\nAhlbi:\nYes! The escapee serves that dreadful master of the Defiant Dragons. They say the prisoner's a former soldier, and that he wields a big scary knife. Rumor has it, he's a cold-blooded killer to boot.\nPhoenix:\nHe sounds like a really dangerous man.\nAhlbi:\nHe is. But the police still can't find him, even after an exhaustive search!\nPhoenix:\n...Wait. (I remember hearing about a prison...)\nRayfa:\nThere is a prison at the apex of this mountain.\nPhoenix:\nA prison? Way up there?\nPhoenix:\nThe prison is at the top of the Inner Sanctum's mountain, right? How did he even break out?\nAhlbi:\nNo one really knows. He supposedly did it without any tools to speak of, too. Some say he must've fallen to his death. Personally, I'd like to believe he did... Otherwise, something like that terrible incident might happen again...\nPhoenix:\nTerrible incident...?\nThe terrible incident (appears after \"The escaped prisoner\")\nPhoenix:\nWhat was that about a \"terrible incident,\" Ahlbi?\nAhlbi:\nIt happened before I was even born, but... ...Queen Amara -- the previous queen -- was assassinated. And it was the rebel leader Dhurke who did it.\nPhoenix:\nThe previous queen was assassinated?! (That's kind of unsettling...)\nAhlbi:\nOoh... It was the terrible deed of a heinous sinner. I mean, to take the life of such a gentle queen?! Only someone with a dark, defiled soul could have done that.\nPhoenix:\n(They really take their queens seriously here. Like, god-worshipping level serious... It really would take someone pretty bold and blasphemous to assassinate one.)\nAhlbi:\nThose Defiant Dragon rebels are not afraid to do anything to accomplish their goals! That's why, with that escaped prisoner on the loose... ...who knows who might be killed next!\nPhoenix:\n(So that's why the people of Khura'in are so afraid of that escapee. And why they want the rebel hunter to take him out, along with the other rebels.) So, is there anything else you can tell me about the rebel hunter Lady Kee'ra, Ahlbi?\nAhlbi:\nUmm, I was just thinking there was something else, but what was it...? Oh, yeah! Here!\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it?\nAhlbi:\nShah'do found it!\nRayfa:\nWhy that's... the Warbaa'd Arrow!\nPhoenix:\nFeeling better now, Your Benevolence?\nRayfa:\nThis is no time to be feeling sorry for myself. For I am the crown princess of Khura'in! Now, let me see that, boy.\nAhlbi:\nY-Yes, Your Benevolence!\nRayfa:\nHmm... It looks very much like one of the legendary weapons Lady Kee'ra once used in battle.\nPhoenix:\nA three-pronged arrow? (I could swear I've seen something resembling that arrowhead recently...) Where did Shah'do find it, Ahlbi?\nAhlbi:\nNear Abbot Inmee's house.\nPhoenix:\n(Near the victim's house, huh... Something tells me I'd better look into this.)\nWarbaa'd Arrow added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nAhlbi, can I ask you to take me to the high priest's house?\nAhlbi:\n...Y-Yes, of course!\nPhoenix:\n(Come to think of it, he was married, wasn't he? And his wife is the one who usually plays the part of Lady Kee'ra in the Purification Rite. I should probably talk to her, too.)\nThe terrible incident (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nWhat was that about a \"terrible incident,\" Ahlbi?\nAhlbi:\nIt happened before I was even born, but... ...Queen Amara -- the previous queen -- was assassinated. And it was the rebel leader Dhurke who did it.\nPhoenix:\nThe previous queen was assassinated?! (That's kind of unsettling...)\nAhlbi:\nOoh... It was the terrible deed of a heinous sinner.

And why they want the rebel hunter to take him out, along with the other rebels.)\nPresent\nWarbaa'd Arrow\nPhoenix:\nSo, that bird over there is a warbaa'd, right?\nAhlbi:\nYes, but they're endangered now.\nPhoenix:\n...I wonder how many of them were killed to make this arrow.\nAhlbi:\nOh... Would you like me to explain, sir?\nPhoenix:\nN-No, that's okay.\nTehmpul Temple\nPresent\nWarbaa'd Arrow\nRayfa:\nThat is the Warbaa'd Arrow.\nPhoenix:\nI don't see the connection between this arrow and a warbaa'd, though.\nRayfa:\nThe feathers of a warbaa'd were used in its fletching. And its design was also inspired by the official bird of Khura'in.\nPhoenix:\nWow, you were able to explain all that without Nayna.\nRayfa:\nWhat did you just say?\nPhoenix:\nUm... N-Nothing! Never mind! (Why can't I ever keep my big mouth shut?!)\nAfter clearing \"The terrible incident\" Talk option in Khura'in - Bazaar:\nMay 10High Priest's House\nPhoenix:\n(So this is where the high priest lived. Wait a minute. This is where they brought me when my back gave out. And the woman in front of that altar... She must be the high priest's wife...)\nExamine\nWoman\nLeads to:\n\"Excuse me...\"\nAnywhere else\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Rayfa is glaring at me with a piercing look in her eyes. Guess it'd be rude to start poking around before saying hi to the high priest's wife...)\nPhoenix:\nExcuse me...\nBeh'leeb:\n...Yes? May I help you?\nPhoenix:\nI was hoping to speak with the high priest's wife. Are you her? (Changed from [I was hoping to speak with the high priest's wife. Are you she?] in the original release)\nRayfa:\nPlease forgive the intrusion, Lady Beh'leeb.\nBeh'leeb:\nOh, my... Y-Your Benevolence.\nRayfa:\nPlease, be at ease. What a terrible time this must be for you. I owe much to your husband. You have my deepest sympathies for your tragic loss.\nBeh'leeb:\nYou honor me with your kind words. Look dear, the royal priestess has come to visit us. Yes... Mm-hm. ...What's that? ...Oh, of course... hee hee.\nPhoenix:\n(Sh-She's talking with his funeral picture!)\nBeh'leeb:\nMy husband, too, is delighted that the royal priestess has graced us with her presence.\nRayfa:\nY-You can speak with Abbot Inmee?\nBeh'leeb:\nNo, I don't possess the power to speak with the dead. But I can feel his presence. ...What's that? No, that can wait till later, dear.\nPhoenix:\n(Sh-She's definitely speaking with him!)\nBeh'leeb:\n...So, Your Benevolence. What is it that brings you to my humble abode?\nRayfa:\nThis lawyer is investigating your husband's death. And I am watching him to ensure he does not tamper with any of the evidence.\nPhoenix:\nI know this must be difficult, but could I ask you some questions? A good friend of mine has fallen under suspicion, you see.\nBeh'leeb:\nA friend of yours...? So then, you must be Maya's friend from the States... correct?\nPhoenix:\nThat's right.\nBeh'leeb:\n...I'm sorry, but I'm still grieving. ...Isn't that right, dear? ...Yes, I know.\nRayfa:\nAbbot Inmee and his wife were one of the closest and most loving couples in Khura'in. If she is not ready to talk, I will not allow you to press her any further.\nPhoenix:\n(She did just lose the love of her life... It would be incredibly insensitive of me to force answers out of her right now. But I need to talk to her if I want to learn more about the high priest. Plus, there's the Warbaa'd Arrow that Ahlbi found near the house. There's too much I need to find out for me to leave just yet.) Um... Would it be okay if I stayed here for a little while?\nRayfa:\nBarbed Head! Have you not been listening to a word I said?!\nPhoenix:\nLook, Your Benevolence. I'm sorry for her loss, but I'm running out of time. So what I will do is promise to leave if she doesn't change her mind.\nBeh'leeb:\nPlease, let me talk to my husband about this. ...Yes. Mm-hm. I know... No, don't. Not in front of the royal priestess. Now, if you would excuse me.\nPhoenix:\n(Wh-What the heck were they even talking about?)\nRayfa:\nYou have but poured salt on her wounds. This is precisely why you lawyers are so despised!\nPhoenix:\nUrk! (I was just trying to help Maya's case. I didn't mean to hurt Mrs. Inmee...)\nRayfa:\nCould it be that you actually possess a conscience?\nPhoenix:\nOf course I do! But I'm also desperate for information.\nRayfa:\n...So, what do you plan to do now?\nPhoenix:\nPass the time by looking around the room, I guess, and see if she changes her mind.\nRayfa:\nJust see that you do not touch anything you should not.\nPhoenix:\n(Guess I should watch what I touch, then. Just in case Princess Rayfa gets mad at me...)\nExamine\nAltar\nPhoenix:\nWhat a magnificent altar.\nRayfa:\nOf course it is magnificent -- it is for the Holy Mother, after all.\nPhoenix:\nThe Holy Mother... Is she that faceless figure there?\nRayfa:\nSuch insolence! How do you not know who Her Holiness is on sight?! Do you seek to cross over into the Twilight Realm right this instant?\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry! It won't happen again!\nRayfa:\n...Hmph, this is why lawyers are so despised. Now listen well: Depicting Her Holiness's face is the greatest taboo in all of Khura'inism. There are none alive today who know what her face really looks like. And that includes the members of the royal family.\nPhoenix:\nWow, now there's an unusual custom... (It's gotta be one heck of a secret if even the royal family can't know what she looks like.)\nInner Sanctum poster\nPhoenix:\nA poster... of the mountains? Oh, the Inner Sanctum mountain is featured against those other towering peaks.\nRayfa:\nThose beautiful mountains are known as the \"Roof of Khura'in.\" Ah, and I see they have even included Mt. Poniponi in that poster.\nPhoenix:\nMt. Poniponi? (Is that the smaller peak to the left?)\nRayfa:\nKnown as the \"Little Sanctum,\" it is just west of the Inner Sanctum. Is it not also beautiful? But I suppose a lawyer with a defiled soul such as you could not perceive such beauty.\nPhoenix:\nN-No, that's not true! I think it's absolutely stunning!\nMountain Range Poster added to the Court Record.\nInner Sanctum poster (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nA poster... of the mountains? Oh, the Inner Sanctum mountain is featured against those other towering peaks.\nRayfa:\nThose beautiful mountains are known as the \"Roof of Khura'in.\" Ah, and I see they have even included Mt. Poniponi in that poster.\nPhoenix:\nMt. Poniponi? (Is that the smaller peak to the left?)\nRayfa:\nKnown as the \"Little Sanctum,\" it is just west of the Inner Sanctum. Is it not also beautiful? But I suppose a lawyer with a defiled soul such as you could not perceive such beauty.\nPhoenix:\nN-No, that's not true! I think it's absolutely stunning!\nOrb\nPhoenix:\nIs this... a piece of art of some sort?\nRayfa:\nWhat a beautiful orb. ...Hm?\nPhoenix:\nIs something the matter?\nRayfa:\nBarbed Head, take one step back!\nPhoenix:\nO-Okay... Done. Did you spot something?\nRayfa:\nYes, your dismal reflection. It was ruining the orb's beauty.\nPhoenix:\nD-Did you have to put it like that, Your Benevolence?\nTV\nPhoenix:\nWhat show is this?\nRayfa:\nIt is \"The Plumed Punisher: Warrior of Neo Twilight Realm.\" It is based on Lady Kee'ra and is the number-one action-hero show in Khura'in.\nPhoenix:\n\"The Plumed Punisher: Warrior of Neo Twilight Realm\"?\nRayfa:\nYes, it is an entirely original show created right here in our kingdom.\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not so sure about its \"originality,\" given its overall look and that theme song...)\nRayfa:\nIs something the matter?\nPhoenix:\nWell, it's just, we have an action-hero show back home that is really similar to this. (I'm guessing this show's why Maya is so into Lady Kee'ra... Honestly, the theme song is exactly the same as the one for Maya's favorite show... ...\"The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo.\" It's a popular action-hero series filmed right in LA. Set in a city known as Neo Olde Tokyo, it pits the Steel Samurai in mortal combat... ...against his nemesis, the Evil Magistrate. Maya's collected DVDs and merchandise from that series as long as I've known her.) The Plumed Punisher seems awfully similar to the Steel Samura--\nRayfa:\nThe Plumed Punisher originated HERE, in Khura'in. Is that clear, Barbed Head?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Benevolence! (Note to self: Never suggest that again.)\nWastebasket\nPhoenix:\nThis looks like a wastebasket... Hey, there's an envelope sticking out. (Hmm... There are three holes in a row near the top. Now, where have I seen holes like these before?)\nRayfa:\nScrounging around in other people's garbage like some stray dog... You are a pitiful creature, indeed.\nPhoenix:\nUm... What does it say here? (Say what you will, but I've got a job to do!)\nRayfa:\nIt says, \"To the high priest.\" Hmph... You cannot even read? You are even more pitiful than I had thought.\nPhoenix:\nTh-Thanks. And I will keep your words of wisdom in mind, Your Benevolence. (Guess I should've studied some Khura'inese before I came...) So the envelope was addressed to the high priest, huh? ...But it's empty. Still, there's something about it... I'd better hang on to it.\nEnvelope added to the Court Record.\nWastebasket (subsequent times)\nRayfa:\nBarbed Head, it appears you are quite fond of rummaging through the garbage.\nPhoenix:\nI just thought there might be some other important piece of evidence in here.\nRayfa:\nOh, is that right? ..................\nPhoenix:\n...Look, I'm not doing this for fun! Really! (Doesn't look like there's anything else of interest in there.)\nSpiked cushion\nPhoenix:\nWh-What is this scary-looking spiky thing?\nRayfa:\nIt is a floor cushion for heightening a practitioner's mental focus. Your ignorance astounds me. There is not a soul in Khura'in who would not recognize this.\nPhoenix:\nA floor cushion? You mean you're supposed to sit on this?\nRayfa:\nHmph. How else would you suggest it be used?\nPhoenix:\n(It looks like a torture device to me.)\nWanted poster\nPhoenix:\nOh, it's a wanted poster for the rebel escapee everyone's talking about.\nRayfa:\nWhat? Let me see that. \"Datz Are'bal, senior member of insurgent leadership, and former paratrooper of a... ...foreign land. Wanted for crimes against the kingdom. Considered armed and dangerous.\"\nPhoenix:\n(So he's ex-military, huh...)\nRayfa:\nHis appearance alone exudes menace. He must be captured at once.\nWanted Poster added to the Court Record.\nRayfa:\n...Hm?\nPhoenix:\nIs something wrong?\nRayfa:\nThe bounty is three million dahmas -- money that comes out of the people's tax payments. I shall have it lowered to about one million dahmas.\nPhoenix:\n...You seem unexpectedly concerned with the people's welfare.\nRayfa:\n\"Unexpectedly\"? How rude! Nayna has always taught me that \"kingdoms that do not value its people come to ruin.\" As crown princess, it is only natural that I care for my people!\nPhoenix:\nHow about sending some of that kindness this way?\nRayfa:\nHmm... Well, I suppose I could... ...If you quit being a lawyer, and paid taxes to our kingdom, that is!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh well. It was worth a shot...)\nWanted poster (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nOh, it's a wanted poster for the rebel escapee everyone's talking about.\nRayfa:\nWhat? Let me see that. \"Datz Are'bal, senior member of insurgent leadership, and former paratrooper of a... ...foreign land. Wanted for crimes against the kingdom.

Well, I suppose I could... ...If you quit being a lawyer, and paid taxes to our kingdom, that is!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh well. It was worth a shot...)\nBoard game\nPhoenix:\nThis game looks kind of like checkers or chess.\nRayfa:\nYou mean to say you have never heard of Kachu'demahl? I have heard people describe it as \"Khura'inese chess.\"\nPhoenix:\nSo two players take turns moving their pieces in a bid to capture the other's king?\nRayfa:\nNot quite. In Kachu'demahl, the object is the utter annihilation of your opponent. Furthermore, each piece has a special move that can only be used once per game.\nPhoenix:\n(Special moves? It sounds like a game right up Maya's alley...)\nHandbag\nPhoenix:\nThere's a Steel Samurai patch on this bag. Guess the bag must be Maya's. She probably left it here while she was performing that rite.\nPortraits\nPhoenix:\n(Isn't this that justice minister I met? But who's the woman in the picture next to him? She looks really important. Could she be the Queen of Khura'in?)\nAfter examining Inner Sanctum poster, TV, wastebasket, wanted poster, and handbag:\nRayfa:\nLady Beh'leeb has not had a change of heart, and simply waiting shall not change that.\nPhoenix:\nC-Can't we wait just a little longer? (I wonder if she'll ever open up?)\n???:\nOh, you're still here.\nRayfa:\nLady Beh'leeb...\nPhoenix:\nMrs. Inmee... Do you think you're ready to talk?\nBeh'leeb:\n...Is it okay with you, dear? ...Yes. Yes, I will let him know.\nRayfa:\nLady Beh'leeb, you don't have to speak to this lawyer if it is not your wish.\nBeh'leeb:\nNo, it's quite all right. If my husband were still with us, he would say... \"As much as it pains me to have my lovely wife speak on such matters... ...if it would help to find the truth... then ask whatever you may.\"\nPhoenix:\nO-Okay, I'll take you up on your generous offer. (Wait... Did Mrs. Inmee call herself \"lovely\" just now?)\nRayfa:\nWell, whatever are you waiting for?! Ask your questions quickly, so your departure may be just as swift!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, of course...\nTalk\nTahrust Inmee\nPhoenix:\nDo you have any idea why your husband might have been killed? Was he acting different or doing anything out-of-the-ordinary lately?\nBeh'leeb:\nNo, I don't recall anything of the sort. ........................\nPhoenix:\n(Argh, this is really difficult.) Did anybody have a grudge against him?\nBeh'leeb:\nHe was a kind man, and one of peace. He would never do anything that would cause someone to bear a grudge against him.\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPhoenix:\n(Th-These are... Psyche-Locks! This means Mrs. Inmee is trying to hide something from me. This is the magatama Maya gave me all those years ago... ...and it has a really amazing power. It reacts when someone is hiding something... ...and allows me to see the Psyche-Locks that are holding that person's mind shut. Whenever I see any... ...I only have to present my magatama ([X / Y / R]) to try and unlock them. (Changed from [...I only have to touch my magatama (X) to try and unlock them.] in the original release) Unlocking them all usually allows me to coax the truth out of someone.)\nTahrust Inmee (subsequent times)\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure there was no one who held a grudge against your husband?\nBeh'leeb:\nHe was a kind and gentle soul. He would have never done anything to make someone want to harm him.\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\nPhoenix:\n(Psyche-Locks... I'll have to unlock them before I can get any more information out of her.)\nPresent Magatama\nPhoenix:\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n-- The High Priest --\nPhoenix:\n(Psyche-Locks... They appeared when I asked her whether anyone held a grudge against her husband. That must mean... ...that Mrs. Inmee thought of someone who just might have such a grudge. Let's just stir the pot a little and see what happens.) Mrs. Inmee, I have an idea who your husband's real killer might be.\nBeh'leeb:\nThat would be Maya, would it not?\nPhoenix:\nNo, of course not. It has to be someone with a motive to kill him. This is who I believe had a reason to kill your husband.\nThe escaped prisoner\nPhoenix:\nI believe the escaped prisoner killed your husband. He probably thought that your husband would get in the way of his escape plan.\nBeh'leeb:\nBut were that the case, wouldn't Maya have been slain as well?\nPhoenix:\nOh, you're right. (Guess I'd better find someone else with a possible motive...)\nBeh'leeb:\nSo you see, Maya must have been the killer.\nPhoenix:\nNo, it had to have been someone else.\nLeads back to:\n\"This is who I believe had a reason to kill your husband.\"\nLady Kee'ra\nLeads to:\n\"It was the rebel hunter disguised as Lady Kee'ra. Everyone's talking about her.\"\nThe rebel Dhurke\nPhoenix:\nThe rebel leader Dhurke killed your husband. He did it to stop the Purification Rite.\nBeh'leeb:\nHe must despise Lady Kee'ra for capturing his fellow insurgents. But were that the case, wouldn't he have slain Maya for playing the part of Lady Kee'ra?\nPhoenix:\n...G-Good point. (All right, so it wasn't Dhurke. Time to think about who else might've had a motive.)\nBeh'leeb:\nSo you see, Maya must've been the killer.\nPhoenix:\nNo, it had to have been someone else.\nLeads back to:\n\"This is who I believe had a reason to kill your husband.\"\nPhoenix:\nIt was the rebel hunter disguised as Lady Kee'ra. Everyone's talking about her.\nBeh'leeb:\n\"I know not of what you speak.\"\nPhoenix:\nReally? Because she even made the front page recently.\nBeh'leeb:\n\"Kwah kah kah kah kah! I am but a humble servant of Lady Kee'ra. What reason would she have to kill someone as insignificant as I?\"\nPhoenix:\nActually... I have something that just might show why Lady Kee'ra would kill Abbot Inmee.\nPresent Lady Kee'ra's Warning\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"This is a letter of warning from Lady Kee'ra.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nBeh'leeb:\nI don't see how that's connected with my husband -- or Lady Kee'ra, for that matter.\nPhoenix:\nR- Really? B-But doesn't this part here remind you of your husband?\nBeh'leeb:\nWhat are you talking about?\nPhoenix:\nUm, then... take a look at this part here! It really resembles Lady Kee'ra, doesn't it!\nBeh'leeb:\nI am not seeing this \"resemblance.\"\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry. It looks like I was mistaken... (That's strange. I could swear I had something that could prove... ...that the high priest was being threatened by Lady Kee'ra.)\nBeh'leeb:\nIt seems there really was no connection between my husband and Lady Kee'ra.\nPhoenix:\nSorry, but I beg to differ.\nLeads back to:\n\"I have something that just might show why Lady Kee'ra would kill Abbot Inmee.\"\nPhoenix:\nThis is a letter of warning from Lady Kee'ra. Maya found it. It was in the Inner Sanctum -- and only Maya and your husband were there at the time.\nBeh'leeb:\nAugh!\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nPhoenix:\nThis letter reached its intended recipient, your husband -- the high priest -- didn't it?\nBeh'leeb:\nAnd how do you know Maya wasn't lying to you? Because I've never seen that letter before, and I doubt my husband ever did, either.\nPhoenix:\nSorry, but... I have evidence that proves this warning was meant for your husband.\nPresent Envelope\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"Wh-What's that?\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nPhoenix:\nThis proves that the warning was meant for your husband.\nBeh'leeb:\nUm... I'm afraid I don't understand.\nPhoenix:\nNo, I believe you do. Please take a good look.\nBeh'leeb:\n..................\nPhoenix:\n.........Still drawing a blank, huh. (Maybe I should really compare the warning letter with the rest of the evidence again...)\nBeh'leeb:\nI don't believe the warning has anything to do with my husband.\nPhoenix:\nNo, this warning was meant for him.\nLeads back to:\n\"I have evidence that proves this warning was meant for your husband.\"\nBeh'leeb:\nWh-What's that?\nPhoenix:\nIt's an envelope... addressed to the high priest. The warning letter was delivered to your husband inside this, wasn't it?\nBeh'leeb:\nAugh!\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nBeh'leeb:\n\"...What nonsense is this? How can you prove the warning was delivered in this envelope?\"\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... There's gotta be some way to prove it... Wait a second. Don't the envelope and the warning letter have something in common?) ...I think there just might be something that links the envelope to the warning letter.\nBeh'leeb:\n\"There is?!\"\nPhoenix:\nYes, and that proof is right here on the warning letter. This spot on the warning letter proves that it was delivered in that envelope!\nPresent holes\nPhoenix:\nLeads to:\n\"The three holes in the envelope...\"\nPresent anywhere else\nPhoenix:\nBeh'leeb:\nThis spot?\nPhoenix:\nUm, no, a little lower. Oh, no, a little to the right. Errr... maybe it was all in my mind?\nBeh'leeb:\n.........Are you trying to be funny? At a time like this?\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry... (Didn't the envelope and warning letter have something in common?)\nBeh'leeb:\nIt seems the envelope was for some other letter, and not this warning.\nPhoenix:\nNo, I'm positive the warning letter was in the envelope addressed to the high priest. Look at this spot on the warning letter. It shows that the letter was in that envelope!\nLeads back to examination\nPhoenix:\nThe three holes in the envelope... ...are in the same shape and arrangement as the holes in the warning letter. And if you fold the letter in thirds and place it in the envelope, the holes line up.\nBeh'leeb:\nAugh!\nPhoenix:\nAs for what made the holes... I believe it was this...!\nPresent Warbaa'd Arrow\nLeads to:\n\"They were made by this Warbaa'd Arrow -- one of the weapons favored by Lady Kee'ra.\"\nPresent anything else\nPhoenix:\nBeh'leeb:\nWhat do you think about this, dear?\nPhoenix:\nSorry, but I'd rather hear your opinion, Mrs. Inmee.\nBeh'leeb:\n\"There are limits to the jests that will be tolerated, lawyer!\"\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry! (So it wasn't this... I'd better take another look at the shape of the holes in the warning and envelope.)\nBeh'leeb:\nThere was never any connection between my husband's murder and Lady Kee'ra, it seems.\nPhoenix:\nNo, the holes in the warning and the envelope can both be linked to her.\nLeads back to:\n\"As for what made the holes... I believe it was this...!\"\nPhoenix:\nThey were made by this Warbaa'd Arrow -- one of the weapons favored by Lady Kee'ra. The warning was folded in thirds, placed in the envelope addressed to the high priest... ...and delivered to your husband on the points of this arrow!\nBeh'leeb:\nEeeeeek!\n1 LOCK BROKEN\nUnlock Successful\nTahrust Inmee (after breaking Psyche-Locks)\nPhoenix:\n...Are you ready to tell me the truth now?\nBeh'leeb:\n.................. I admit the warning was sent to my husband. But he was not an insurgent.\nPhoenix:\nThen why did you keep it a secret?\nBeh'leeb:\nBecause... the authorities might've suspected him of being one if I hadn't.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess that makes sense... If the rebel hunter was after him, I can see how people might at least suspect.)\nBeh'leeb:\nWe are a Khura'inist kingdom. As such, rising up against the monarchy... ...is the same as blaspheming Khura'inism itself.\nPhoenix:\nYour husband was a devout priest of Khura'inism... ...and you feared that his good name would be tarnished if the warning went public.\nBeh'leeb:\n...Yes.\nPhoenix:\n(That makes sense, but is it the honest truth? What if the high priest really was a rebel? The rebel hunter would've had a motive to kill him. Still...)\nBeh'leeb:\n..................\nPhoenix:\n(This just doesn't feel like the right time to ask her about it.)\nThe warning (appears after \"Tahrust Inmee\")\nLeads to:\n\"Could you tell me a little more about the warning?\"\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nBeh'leeb:\nWhat is that badge for?\nPhoenix:\nIt's the attorney's badge used in my country.\nBeh'leeb:\nYes... Mm-hm. ...I agree, dear.\nBeh'leeb:\nMy husband says I should have nothing to do with lawyers.\nPhoenix:\nIt's not like we top the popularity charts back home, but c'mon! Can't a lawyer get a break?\nTahrust's Autopsy Report\nBeh'leeb:\nMy husband's...\nRayfa:\nBarbed Head! Do you not consider the consequences of your actions?!\nPhoenix:\nOh, um... sorry. That was pretty inconsiderate of me.\nBeh'leeb:\nOh...? Is that so? You really are a kind soul, dear.\nBeh'leeb:\n...My husband says he forgives you.\nPhoenix:\nTh-Thank you.\nBeh'leeb:\n\"I understand that you're desperate, but do not cause my lovely wife undue pain.\" \"Do I make myself clear... Lawyer?\"\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, ma'am! Er, I mean, sir!\nWanted Poster\nBeh'leeb:\nWhy, that is the escaped criminal who has all of Khura'in astir.\nBeh'leeb:\nWhen I think how he might still be lurking about, I get so scared, I can't sleep at night.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't blame her, considering she just suddenly lost her husband.)\nBeh'leeb:\nYes... Mm-hm... Really, dear?\nBeh'leeb:\n...My husband said he would protect me if that escaped criminal shows up.\nPhoenix:\n(By \"protect,\" does she mean she'll pummel the escapee with her husband's portrait?)\nPhoenix:\nCould you tell me a little more about the warning?\nBeh'leeb:\nIt arrived about three days before the Purification Rite. When we woke that morning, it was already there by the side of our bed.\nPhoenix:\nIt was by the side of your bed?\nBeh'leeb:\nYes. We had the whole house locked up tight. And yet, someone still managed to slip in. Oh, it was so frightening, wasn't it, dear?\nPhoenix:\nBut you didn't contact the police... ...because you didn't want them to suspect your husband of being a rebel?\nBeh'leeb:\n...That's right. If only we had told the police, maybe Tahrust would still be alive today. \"Oh, lovely wife... No need to fret, my dear. My only regret is that I left you all alone...\"\nRayfa:\nBarbed Head! That is quite enough!\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, you're probably right. Mrs. Inmee, I'm sorry to have bothered you at such a difficult time.\nBeh'leeb:\n...Don't be silly. I'm happy if I have helped. \"Your Benevolence... May you swiftly shine light upon the truth.\"\nRayfa:\nBarbed Head. You seem bent on casting suspicion upon Lady Kee'ra. And by doing so, you seek to deflect the blame from the real killer, Maya Fey. That is the only logical conclusion.\nPhoenix:\n...Gnrk! (I'm in no position to disprove her at this point. If only I could find something to support my theory that the high priest was a rebel... The only other person who might know more about Abbot Inmee would be Maya. They might be done questioning her by now. Maybe I'll stop by the detention center.)\nRayfa:\nMy mother has said what...? Hm, it seems I must go.\nPhoenix:\nDid something happen?\nRayfa:\nYes. My mother has decreed that a rite shall be held for the high priest's passing. And that she shall conduct the Prayer of Lament therein.\nBeh'leeb:\nHer Eminence has so decreed, has she?! Oh, but she should not concern herself with a humble priest like my husband.\nRayfa:\nNo, it is only natural, considering his meritorious service. The rite will be held at the palace. You are to accompany me there at once, Lady Beh'leeb.\nBeh'leeb:\nThank you, Your Benevolence. My husband is most delighted, too.\nPhoenix:\nHow wonderful for you, Mrs. Inmee. (A direct decree from the queen. That must be quite an honor.)\nRayfa:\nBarbed Head, you are coming as well.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? B-But I don't have much time left to investigate...\nRayfa:\nAs the one charged with monitoring you, you must remain within my sight at all times. Besides, it will take but a moment. Now, come along!\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh... Arguing the point will probably just make things worse for me. I'd better let her have her way this time.)\nMay 10Ga'ran Palace - Audience Chamber\nGa'ran:\nWelcome, Lady Beh'leeb.\nPhoenix:\n(So this is the queen of Khura'in...)\nRayfa:\nWhat is wrong with you, Barbed Head?! Show some respect!\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Oh, um... (Sh-Should I bow? Or prostrate myself?)\nGa'ran:\n...No, it is quite all right. Stay as you are.\nRayfa:\nMother...\nBeh'leeb:\n...Your Eminence, I would like to give thanks to you. You honor both me and my husband.\nGa'ran:\nHis exemplary service deserves to be honored. Oh, but what a terribly trying time this must be for you, Lady Beh'leeb. May my prayer comfort your soul, and that of your dearly departed husband. Nothing would please me more.\nBeh'leeb:\nOh, Your Eminence.  Your words are wasted on my humble husband and I... *sniffle*\nPhoenix:\n(Now that's what I call a commanding presence.)\nGa'ran:\nSo, you are the lawyer of whom my daughter speaks.\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Eminence! I am so very honored to make your... n-noble acquaintanceship. I-I'm humbled to bask in your... resplendence? (Ack... Did I overdo it? I have no idea how to talk to a queen.)\nGa'ran:\nHo ho... May the Holy Mother's blessing be upon you. Now then, Lady Beh'leeb. Let us go to the Chamber of Prayer. Rayfa, you are to accompany us, too.\nRayfa:\nYes, Mother.\nPhoenix:\n(Wow, the queen is seriously something else.)\n???:\nHeh. The Prayer of Lament, huh...\nInga:\nDon't see how that'll do any good.\nPhoenix:\n(I-It's... Justice Minister Inga!)\nInga:\nHm? Who're you, buddy?\nPhoenix:\nN-Nice to see you again, Minister Inga.\nInga:\nAgain? Have we met?\nPhoenix:\nI'm Phoenix Wright. We met in the accused lobby the other day.\nInga:\nOh, right. Blue suit, jagged hair... You're that lawyer who brought my daughter down a peg or two.\nPhoenix:\nYour... daughter?\nInga:\nYeah, Rayfa.\nPhoenix:\n(He's Princess Rayfa's father? So he's Queen Ga'ran's husband?)\nInga:\nYou planning on sticking your fat nose in this mess, too?\nPhoenix:\nThe accused is a good friend of mine.\nInga:\nLike I said the last time... ...you better watch yourself, see?\nPhoenix:\nUm, do you mind if I ask you a few questions?\nInga:\nYou want to question me?\nPhoenix:\nThat would be great.\nInga:\nHeh heh heh heh! You got balls, for a lawyer! Guess I can play along a bit. But I got things to do, see? So we'll have to talk while I work.\nExamine\nInga:\nHey, keep your paws off that stuff over there. It's all pretty pricey -- more than you could possibly imagine, I'd wager.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah... I'd better keep my hands to myself.)\nMove\nPhoenix:\n(I bet it'd tick him off if I left now. I should talk to him a bit, and see what he knows.)\nTalk\nThis incident\nPhoenix:\nI wanted to let you know that I'll be the defense lawyer on this case, too.\nInga:\nWell, don't say I didn't warn you. You only won last time 'cause that idiotic prosecutor filed false charges. But it's gonna be different this time. I got Khura'in's top prosecutor on this one, see?\nPhoenix:\nI don't care who I go up against. I'm going to prove my client innocent.\nInga:\nYou haven't forgotten that little thing called the Defense Culpability Act, have you? Blow this one, and you'll suffer the same fate as the accused.\nPhoenix:\nHow could I forget?\nInga:\nHeh, you lawyers are all the same. You strut your stuff till the DC Act comes down hard. Then you start begging and pleading for your lives. It's really hard to watch, I tell you.\nPhoenix:\nW-Well, I don't plan on letting it come to that.\nDefense Culpability Act (appears after \"This incident\")\nLeads to:\n\"Were you the one who wrote the Defense Culpability Act?\"\nPresent\nAnything\nInga:\nWhere do you get off sticking that thing in my face? You forget who you're dealing with? Don't poke your nose where it don't belong. Or do you want a spot on my execution list?\nPhoenix:\nN-No, I'm good! (I'd better end this conversation now, before I really rub him the wrong way.)\nPhoenix:\nWere you the one who wrote the Defense Culpability Act?\nInga:\nHeh, maybe I did, maybe I didn't. What's it to you? Either way, as justice minister I'm gonna enforce the thing.\nPhoenix:\n.........!\nInga:\nIt started as a way to counter the dirty tricks of your trade like falsified evidence. But it turned out to be quite handy... Efficient, even!\nPhoenix:\nHandy...? Efficient...?\nInga:\nYeah, made my job reeeal easy. Any goons who cross me or the Ga'ran administration... ...are gonna get just what they deserve, especially those rebel scum!\nPhoenix:\n......! You can get away with that here?\nInga:\nBetter watch your mouth, lawyer. I enforce the law in Khura'in, see? And being that I'm the queen's husband, that makes me king!\nPhoenix:\n(.........Um, no... I'm pretty sure the queen is the boss around here.)\nInga:\nGo on, say what you're thinking so I can charge you with lese-majesty.\nPhoenix:\nUrk! (I can't get myself arrested now.)\nInga:\nListen up, lawyer. We got a low crime rate and a populace that lives in peace. And that's all thanks to the DC Act. So I don't want to hear any more lip about it.\nPhoenix:\nBut I can't defend my client unless I can speak my mind.\nInga:\nHeh, even without the DC Act, Dhurke and his insurgent scum buddies' days are numbered.\nPhoenix:\nWh-What's that supposed to mean?!\nInga:\nLet's just say... I got a little trick up my sleeve. So I'd watch it if I were you. 'Cause you got a defiant attitude -- like one o' them dragon dupes. Say, White, you know what these are?\nPhoenix:\n...No, what?\nInga:\nOrders of execution. They really pile up if I start slacking off.\nPhoenix:\n...What?\nInga:\nAnd tomorrow, I'll have even more work to do... processing the one for your little friend. And if you really do defend her, I'll have to add one more to the pile for you. But you're not stupid enough to waste your life on that criminal, are ya?\nPhoenix:\n(Don't worry, I'll make sure to lighten your workload, Inga... I won't give you a single execution order to sign tomorrow!)\nRayfa:\nI have returned, Barbed Head.\nPhoenix:\nYour Benevolence. Are you done with the rite?\nRayfa:\nYes. It was performed flawlessly. Lady Beh'leeb stayed behind to speak with Mother.\nPhoenix:\n(I hope this will help ease her sorrow, even if just a little.)\nRayfa:\nSo, you have been speaking with my father?\nPhoenix:\nYes, you could say that.\nRayfa:\nMy father is a great man. He works tirelessly to keep the peace in our kingdom. Khura'in as it stands today owes everything to the efforts of my mother and my father. You should feel deeply honored. Under normal circumstances, they would have never spoken so readily with a lawyer.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, of course. (It seems Rayfa doesn't know what her father is really like.) Well, now that we're done here, let's go see if I can talk to Maya now.\nMay 10Detention Center\nMaya:\nOh, it's you, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nMaya, are you okay? The questioning wasn't too harsh, was it?\nMaya:\nNo, I'm all right. How about you? Make any progress?\nPhoenix:\nWell, I haven't found any conclusive evidence that could prove your innocence... ...but I have a small lead.\nMaya:\nReally?\nPhoenix:\nBut for right now, I'd like to ask you about the high priest.\nMaya:\nSure, ask away. ...By the way, what's the princess doing with you still, Nick? Doesn't she have anything better to do?\nPhoenix:\nDoesn't seem like it...\nRayfa:\nI heard that! How rude! Of course I have many other things I could be doing!\nTalk\nThe high priest\nPhoenix:\nIt's just a thought, but... do you think the high priest could've been a rebel?\nMaya:\nA rebel?! Why would you even think that?!\nPhoenix:\nBecause if he was... ...then the rebel hunter Lady Kee'ra would've had a motive to kill him.\nRayfa:\nWh-Wh-Wh-Whaaaaaaat?!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh-oh. Princess Rayfa overheard me.)\nRayfa:\nWh-Wh-What idiocy is this?! Abbot Inmee, a rebel?! It is beyond the pale! My mother has offered the Prayer of Lament to his soul! That is the sort of person he was!\nPhoenix:\nAll right, all right. I was just raising the possibility.\nRayfa:\nI will not listen to such... such... tomfoolery!\nPhoenix:\n(...She stormed out. Oh, well, nothing we can do about that.) Do you recall the high priest doing anything suspicious?\nMaya:\nHmm... Come to think of it, he seemed unusually restless during the rite. He kept glancing up at the sky, though I have no idea why.\nPhoenix:\n...He was restless and kept looking up at the sky? Hmm, that doesn't really tell us much, does it? Anything else come to mind?\nMaya:\n...Sorry, that's about it.\nPhoenix:\n(Guess this is all I'm going to learn about the high priest right now. Oh, but there is one thing I should follow up on...)\nMaya:\nI want to keep my spirit channeling ability a secret while I'm here, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWhat? Why?\nMaya:\nI'll, um... explain later.\nPhoenix:\n(With Princess Rayfa gone, this might be my only chance.)\nChanneling (appears after \"The high priest\")\nPhoenix:\nMaya, about what you said earlier... Why can't you tell anyone you're able to channel spirits?\nMaya:\nOh, that! You know how all the queens are also spirit mediums here?\nPhoenix:\nI heard. It was kind of a shock at first, though.\nMaya:\nIn Khura'inism, spirit channeling is a secret art that can only be performed by the queen. No one else is supposed to be able to do it.\nPhoenix:\nI see. So spirit channeling is a symbol of power or authority, then, in that sense. I can see why it would look bad if a \"nobody\" from another country were able to do it, too.\nMaya:\nSpirit Channeling in the Kurain Tradition... ...was developed from a Khura'inist style that was brought to the U.S. via Japan. But it seems like my clan's spiritual power is greater than that of the average Khura'inese. It may be a quirk due to how our styles diverged, but I don't really know.\nPhoenix:\n(So, if spirit channeling is a power possessed only by the queens of Khura'in... ...and it's a power that somehow made its way down the line to Maya... ...then I guess that makes Queen Ga'ran and Princess Rayfa distant relatives of Maya's...?)\nMaya:\nAnyway, it's not like there's some kind of rule about it. It's just, I'd rather not have it become an issue or anything. That's why mediums who come here to train hide the fact that they can channel spirits.\nPhoenix:\nI see... (I had no idea it was so complicated.)\nMaya:\nEither way, training here is a must to fulfill the qualification needed to become the master.\nPhoenix:\nAnd what is this qualification to become the master?\nMaya:\nTo be able to channel spirits of one's own volition and without fail every time. Like, remember how my spirit channeling was always hit or miss? I only ever succeeded about thirty percent of the time.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, and it was more like spirits possessed her, as apposed to her channeling them...) So you can do it every single time now, whenever you want?\nMaya:\nYep! ...At least, I think.\nPhoenix:\nYou think?\nMaya:\nWell, I haven't actually tried channeling anyone since I completed my training here. But once I get back home, I plan on taking the final spirit medium test. I'll have to try channeling one spirit after another in a marathon channeling session!\nPhoenix:\nOnly those who pass the test are worthy of becoming the master, huh?\nMaya:\nYeah, but I know I can do it. I'm going to ace that test and become the next master! After all, I can't let my clan and the other villagers down.\nPhoenix:\n(Right... Maya's the next big hope of Kurain Village. That's got to be a lot of pressure.) So, speaking of similarities... ...I've noticed another similarity between our countries besides spirit channeling. I saw a show on TV earlier that reminded me of \"The Steel Samurai.\"\nMaya:\nOh, you must mean \"The Plumed Punisher: Warrior of Neo Twilight Realm\"!\nThe Plumed Punisher (appears after \"Channeling\")\nLeads to:\n\"So, you've already seen \"The Plumed Punisher\"? You really don't miss a beat!\"\nPresent\nLady Kee'ra's Warning\nPhoenix:\nWhy would Lady Kee'ra want to stop the Purification Rite? ...Ooh, I know!\nPhoenix:\nYou do?\nMaya:\nYeah! Because she's only got the one outfit and nothing to change into!\nPhoenix:\nYou'd think she'd have normal clothes for when she's not busy rebel hunting, Maya...\nMaya:\nSo, you've already seen \"The Plumed Punisher\"? You really don't miss a beat!\nPhoenix:\nActually, it was Her Benevolence who told me all about it.\nRayfa:\nThere is not a single person in Khura'in who does not know of it.\nPhoenix:\nOh, Your Benevolence. You're back.\nRayfa:\nAs the royal priestess, I am charged with monitoring your movements. So, I have changed my mind. For in order to fulfill my duty... ...I must not avert my ears -- not even from your blasphemous theories.\nPhoenix:\n(Her sense of duty is commendable... ...but I wouldn't mind if she backed off a bit.)\nMaya:\nGreat timing, Your Benevolence. There's, actually, something I wanted to show off to the both of you.\nPhoenix:\nShow off? (Maya sure seems excited all of a sudden...)\nMaya:\nYup! Ta-daaaah!\nPhoenix:\nWh- What's that?\nMaya:\nIt's an ultra-rare Plumed Punisher strap! There's only one of them in the whole world! It was specially made to promote the TV show!\nRayfa:\nY-You're the owner of this strap?!\nPhoenix:\nDon't tell me... you're a Plumed Punisher fan, too, Your Benevolence?\nRayfa:\nN-No, of course not. Only little children watch that show! I have no interest in such things!\nPhoenix:\nRight...\nRayfa:\nNo, I am telling the truth!\nPhoenix:\n...Sure, let's just leave it at that. ...So, how did you get your hands on that, Maya?\nMaya:\nEh heh heh! I found a kindred spirit in a Plumed Punisher fan here in Khura'in! It resulted in an exchange of cultures transcending national borders!\nPhoenix:\nAnd by cultural exchange, you mean you swapped TV show promo merchandise?\nMaya:\nYou bet! I traded my Steel Samurai watch for this strap. It's a super rare watch that plays The Steel Samurai theme song when the alarm goes off. My newfound Khura'inese friend was so happy, I got this one-of-a-kind strap in return!\nPhoenix:\nI guess there are people like that wherever you go -- even here in Khura'in...\nMaya:\nWatch this! When you press the magatama on her belt, it plays the show's theme song!\nPhoenix:\nThat sounds just like The Steel Samurai theme song.\nMaya:\nWhat are you talking about? Can't you hear the folk instruments in the intro and the exotic tones throughout? Plus, the Steel Samurai has Japanese taiko drums that go... ...daka don-don-don in the intro!\nPlumed Punisher Strap added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nUmm, right... Guess my ears just aren't as good as yours.\nMaya:\nAnyway, I have this amazing idea for a new show. \"The Plumed Punisher vs. The Steel Samurai\"! I'm going to totally go pitch it to some TV stations when I get back home! It's going to be a huge hit! Right, Your Benevolence?\nRayfa:\nI-I have no interest in such things!\nPhoenix:\n(Well, if nothing else... ...talking about \"The Plumed Punisher\" has, thankfully, seemed to cheer Maya up a bit.) It's getting late. Try to get some sleep, okay, Maya? And leave tomorrow to me.\nMaya:\n...Okay. Thanks, Nick.\nPhoenix:\n(I think I've covered just about everything. Time to head back to the temple and go over everything I've learned so far.)\nPlaza of Devotion, Inner Sanctum, Detention Center, or Bazaar\nTalk\nAny ideas?\nRayfa:\nMy father is a great man with a gentle soul, is he not?\nPhoenix:\nYes, well... (Are we talking about the same person here?)\nRayfa:\nYou, too, could become a man of upstanding character if you learned from his example.\nPhoenix:\nS-Sure... (Upstanding character? Him...?)\nRayfa:\n...I care little for that tone of yours. It is as if you do not agree!\nPhoenix:\nN- No, you have it all wrong! (Why is my face always such an open book?!)\nWhat to do\nRayfa:\nYou have visited the accused a number of times already. Could it be you are smuggling in tools one at a time for a jailbreak?\nPhoenix:\nOf course not! Besides, you've been watching me like a hawk!\nRayfa:\nWell then, perhaps you are cutting the bars in the visitor's room bit by bit.\nPhoenix:\nHow on earth would I even do that?!\nRayfa:\nWith that barbed head of yours, of course.\nPhoenix:\nNow this is getting ridiculous...\nRayfa:\nHeh, of course it is. I'm merely having a little fun here.\nPhoenix:\nWell, please don't have it at my expense! (I'm mentally taxed enough already...!)\nPresent\nWanted Poster\nRayfa:\nAh, the escaped prisoner... He has the very face of evil. It actually reminds me of you... lawyer.\nPhoenix:\nI hardly think I look that scary.\nRayfa:\nHmph. Do not doubt my all-seeing eye in such matters, Barbed Head. It is the appearance of your mitamah that reminds me of his evil face.\nPhoenix:\nWell, if we're talking about my soul, I guess I just have to trust your professional opinion. (If it wasn't for the express purpose of making me out to be a criminal, that is.)\nPlumed Punisher Strap\nRayfa:\nDo not flaunt that strap before me!\nPhoenix:\nYou know, I get the feeling you really want this for yourself, Your Benevolence.\nRayfa:\nYou... youuu... nincompoop! You know not of what you speak! I desired it so dearly, that I had all of our retainers dispatch multiple postcards for it.\nPhoenix:\n(All right, then. It seems \"really want\" was an understatement.)\nHigh Priest's House\nExamine\nPortraits\nPhoenix:\nPictures of the queen and her husband, the Justice Minister of Khura'in.\nRayfa:\nYes, my mother and my father. What do you think? Do they not possess an awe-inspiring air?\nPhoenix:\nOh, um... ( \"Terrifying\" is more the word I would use...)\nRayfa:\nWell?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes! They are very awe-inspiring!\nPresent\nPlumed Punisher Strap\nBeh'leeb:\nTh-That's...!\nPhoenix:\nIt's a strap that Maya received. Would you happen to know anything about it?\nBeh'leeb:\n...It's for the Plumed Punisher action hero.\nRayfa:\nOf course she knows, Barbed Head! It's only the most popular show in all of Khura'in!\nBeh'leeb:\nIt would seem... that the royal priestess is more familiar with the matter than I.\nRayfa:\nWhat?! N-No! I was... simply advocating on behalf of the show's fans!\nMay 10Tehm'pul Temple\nPhoenix:\n(It's getting late. Won't be long till sundown.)\n???:\nMr. Wright, Your Benevolence!\nAhlbi:\nAre you done with your investigation for today?\nPhoenix:\nPretty much. I thought I'd go over what I've learned so far. Care to join me?\nAhlbi:\nYes! Please allow me to help!\nPhoenix:\nOkay. First, we know that the high priest received a warning three days ago. It was from someone claiming to be Lady Kee'ra, and it told him not to perform the rite.\nAhlbi:\nThat's right! It was that rebel hunter. But what of it?\nPhoenix:\nThat's what I'm not sure of yet. Why would Lady Kee'ra want to stop the rite?\nAhlbi:\nIf you could solve that mystery...\nPhoenix:\nRight. I could figure out her motive for threatening the high priest. It might be the break I need, but I just don't know enough right now to act on that lead.\nRayfa:\nHow unfortunate for you, Barbed Head. Your only hope is pure speculation. That shall not stand up in the Hall of Justice. You have no actual proof of Lady Kee'ra's involvement in this crime, after all.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah...The warning letter alone can't prove who killed the high priest.)\nRayfa:\nI'll give you one last chance to withdraw before you are charged under the DC Act.\nAhlbi:\nYour Benevolence!\nRayfa:\nWhile it is true you did not forge or suppress any evidence... ...that is, perhaps, a product of my careful monitoring of your every move.\nPhoenix:\nI wasn't planning to do anything like that in the first place, Your Benevolence. But I AM going to prove Maya's innocence, within the confines of the law!\nRayfa:\nH-How can you be so sure you will?\nPhoenix:\nBecause of my undying faith in my clients. That is a lawyer's greatest weapon.\nRayfa:\n.................. Hmph. What nonsense. You have chosen to dig your own grave. When next we meet, it shall be in the Hall of Justice. As royal priestess, it is my duty to reveal the truth through the Divination Séance. This time, I will prove that the insights I glean thereof are the very truth itself. Prepare yourself, for this shall be your last trial... and your last rites. Tomorrow shall end with you under the headsman's axe!\nPhoenix:\n(Tomorrow... I'll be defending Maya in that so-called Hall of Justice again. That whole Séance thing makes trials here completely different from those back home. Plus, I don't have a shred of conclusive evidence. On the other hand, I've got plenty of confusion and anxiety to spare. I'll have to think of something. After all, I'm the only lawyer in all of Khura'in. I have to do this. I WILL do this! I'll prove Maya's innocence if it's the last thing I do!)\nTo be continued\nNothing to examine during investigation\nPhoenix:\nNothing particularly interesting here.\nArea already examined\nPhoenix:\nI've already searched here, but it never hurts to take another look around.\nExit Magatama session\nPhoenix:\n(I think I have all the information I need. Maybe I should go over everything I have.)",

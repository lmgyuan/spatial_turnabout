Get out your handkerchiefs for our special guest! That's right, baby! The night's just getting started!\nThank you for coming to the Gavinners: \"Guilty as Charged\" Tour! This ends the first part of tonight's show. There will now be a 20-minute intermission.\nJuly 7, 8:05 PMBackstage Hallway\nExamine evidence\nAttorney's Badge\nBack side\nApollo:\nThere's a number inscribed on the back of the badge. There are many numbers like it, but this one is mine. Proof that I'm an attorney. To tell the truth, I get a happy feeling inside just looking at it.\nTrucy:\nThis is so cool! Us, at a Gavinners concert!\nApollo:\nHuh? Did you say something? My ears are still ringing... The Gavinners: putting the \"sick\" back in \"music\".\nTrucy:\nWell, I thought Mr. Gavin was really nice! Sending us those tickets at 20% off! They're hard to get ahold of, you know.\nApollo:\nWhen you invite people to a concert it's usually free.\nTrucy:\nLet's head to his dressing room, Apollo! You know, like we're a couple of VIPs. I've always dreamed of being a VIP at a Gavinners show!\nApollo:\nUm, Trucy... You didn't know who Prosecutor Gavin was before that case. What kind of fan doesn't know the lead vocalist's name?\nTrucy:\nOh! This guy, well, he was more like a prince really. He let us in...\nTrucy:\nKlavier... What a lovely name! He's so dreamy!\nTrucy:\nYeah, but I'm a girl! I'm supposed to swoon over gods of rock!\nApollo:\nGod-awful, maybe.\nTrucy:\nI bought all their stuff on the way home from the trial! I got twelve Gavinners albums, and fifteen concert videos!\nApollo:\n...That was quite a bit of impulse shopping.\nTrucy:\nI got an advance on my next 15-years-worth of allowance.\nApollo:\n...For Mr. Wright that sounds like a real act of generosity.\nApollo:\n(Who would have imagined me here... ...at a Gavinners concert, watching Prosecutor Gavin \"rock\". To be honest... ...he was kind of cool. And I'm kind of envious. Not that I'd ever admit that to Trucy.)\nJuly 7Gavinners's Dressing Room\nKlavier:\nAh, you made it.\nTrucy:\nMr. Gavin! Thanks so much for the tickets!\nApollo:\n...And the invoice you sent along with them.\nTrucy:\nYou were incredible up on stage, Mr. Gavin!\nKlavier:\nNothing like music to brighten the mood after a trial, ja? ...And we're almost ready for our next act. I'm looking forward to it myself.\nTrucy:\nLamiroir's singing, right!? The \"Siren of the Ballad\"?\nApollo:\nOh yeah... That flyer said she flew all the way over for this show.\nKlavier:\nThat's right. I happened to catch her show while overseas. Her voice... is divine. I knew I had to invite her to perform with us.\n???:\nLamiroir says... \"You praise me too highly.\"\nApollo:\n(Whoa! Who's this guy? He's huge!)\nKlavier:\nAh, allow me to introduce Mr. Romein LeTouse. ...Lamiroir's manager. And her interpreter, incidentally.\nLeTouse:\nIt is a great honor for us to be here. And a great honor for Lamiroir to be heard in this country.\n???:\n[Foreign text]....\nApollo:\n(That voice... I wish I could understand it... It's beautiful.)\n???:\n[Foreign text]... [Foreign text]...\nTrucy:\nOoooh! It's Lamiroir! I'm actually meeting Lamiroir!\nApollo:\n(Lamiroir... Mysterious songstress... Her quiet, deep song glides through the air... Lilting above a sparse, but elegant piano accompaniment. Now this is music. She's a real artist.)\nLamiroir:\n[Foreign text]....\nLeTouse:\nLamiroir says... \"We have long looked forward to this joint performance.\"\nKlavier:\nAh, Lamiroir... Your voice... ...It is art.\nLamiroir:\n[Foreign text]....\nLeTouse:\n\"Yet without his piano to guide me... ...it is but a voice.\"\n???:\n....................\nApollo:\n(I've seen this kid somewhere before.)\nTrucy:\nHe plays piano at all of Lamiroir's concerts! He's cute! And he's a really good pianist.\nApollo:\nGood pianists are a dying breed, I hear.\nLeTouse:\nAllow me to introduce Machi Tobaye. ...He is blind. This is why he never strays far from Lamiroir. They are always together.\nMachi:\n....................\nApollo:\n(They're like characters from some fairy tale..)\nTrucy:\nLamiroir's so, um, what's that word... Exotic! ...And mysterious!\nApollo:\nShe does seem quite pretty. At least, her eyes do.\nKlavier:\nHers is a kind of \"sight-seeing musique\"...\nTrucy:\nHuh?\nKlavier:\nShe travels the globe, putting the sights she sees into song. Even though her appearance and voice are exotic... ...her songs remind us of something close, and warm.\nTrucy:\nSights into song... That's so poetic!\nKlavier:\nShe was gracious enough to put music to my lyrics tonight. \"The Guitar's Serenade\". ...I hope you enjoy it.\nTrucy:\nI can't wait!\nKlavier:\n...And now it is time. For the next part, we're giving the Gavinners's hard rock a little rest. Lamiroir, the stage is yours.\nLamiroir:\n[Foreign text]....\nLeTouse:\nThe band members will not play during Lamiroir's ballad. Only Machi's tender tones, and Lamiroir's dulcet voice...\nKlavier:\n...And my guitar, of course.\nTrucy:\nWoo hoo! Nights like this make it all worthwhile, you know!\nApollo:\n(I should have learned to play the guitar. There's not much romance in Chords of Steel.)\nKlavier:\nShall we hit the stage, then?\nTrucy:\nGood luck, Mr. Gavin!\nKlavier:\nTake care your hearts aren't stolen away, ja?\nTrucy:\nLet's get back to the concert hall, Polly!\nSugar, Sugar...\nO that night, in your embrace.\nWhen you stole away the keys\nmy heart held on to so tight.\nPleasure...\nBut a fleeting melody\nIt wraps itself around me,\nAnd now through the air I fly.\nWoh... Woh...\nBurning on in my heart. Fire.\nBurn my love away. All away.\nLike a bullet of love. Fire.\nTake my life away. All away.\nGuitar, Guitar...\nUp together to the sky.\nJuly 7, 9:05 PMBackstage Hallway\nTrucy:\nWow, wasn't Lamiroir amazing? I *sniffle* I even cried a little!\nApollo:\nI was surprised Prosecutor Gavin actually burned his guitar.\nTrucy:\nYeah! That even surprised me, and I'm a magician! What a production!\nApollo:\nWhat a destruction. (I don't think Prosecutor Gavin was expecting it either, oddly. He looked as surprised as I was.)\nTrucy:\nIs that what they call \"risking life and limb for art\"? I think he's my new hero!\nApollo:\nI'm not sure I'd call that \"art\".\nTrucy:\nWell, what are we doing here? Let's get going to Mr. Gavin's dressing room! There's twenty minutes till the last part of the show!\nApollo:\nHow many breaks does this band need?\nJuly 7Gavinners's Dressing Room\nKlavier:\nWhat the heck was that!? I was never consulted about it!\nStaff:\nS-Sorry, Mr. Gavin, sir! I've asked the man in charge...\nKlavier:\nI play new rock, not Great Balls of Fire! Speaking of fire, I have a good mind to fire whoever's responsible!\nTrucy:\n...He seems upset.\nKlavier:\nApollo Justice! Were you the one who tried to torch me!?\nApollo:\nHey, I didn't do it!\nTrucy:\nSo much for risking your life for art...\nKlavier:\n\"The Guitar's Serenade\" is ruined! Ruined!\nTrucy:\nWell, let's try to talk to him at least.\nApollo:\n...I'm not sure that's the best move right now.\nExamine\nBlack gloves\nApollo:\nThose are some pretty heavy-duty gloves. Maybe they have to carry around hot pots or something?\nTrucy:\nThey are a little thick. I couldn't even stuff a pigeon in those.\nApollo:\n...... That's exactly what I was thinking.\nBowl of stew\nApollo:\nWhy is that plastic bowl of stew sitting there?\nTrucy:\nMaybe they use it for interrogating bad guys... \"'Fess up to what you did, and we'll let you eat that stew!\"\nApollo:\nThat's just mean.\nTrucy:\nIt gets worse! See, if the bad guy confesses, they say: \"OK, eat it... If you can! See, it's made of plastic!\" It's like, you don't know which ones are the real bad guys!\nApollo:\nI think you need to take a deep breath, Trucy.\nChains\nApollo:\nThis place is decorated like a high-school dance. Though I think our decorations were paper, not... chains.\nTrucy:\nThe Gavinners are into chains. It's part of their image.\nApollo:\nHuh, no kidding.\nTrucy:\nEver since they used chains on the cover art for \"Gunna Lock U Up\".\nApollo:\nThey're really into the whole police thing, aren't they.\nTrucy:\nIt'd be cooler if they turned that red light on.\nApollo:\n...They don't have to turn on the red light.\nCruiser Guitar\nTrucy:\nOoh! A \"Cruiser Guitar\"! They sold those to commemorate five years of the band.\nApollo:\nRocking it hard... under the speed limit.\nTrucy:\nThere's a \"Cruiser Bass\", and a \"Cruiser Drum Set\", and a \"Cruiser Keyboard\"... ...Even a \"Cruiser Whistle\".\nApollo:\n...I'm not so sure about that last one.\nTrucy:\nIt's for blowing the whistle on criminals!\nApollo:\n...I don't think that requires an actual whistle, Trucy.\nLipstick on mirror\nApollo:\nSomeone drew the Gavinners's mark in lipstick here.\nTrucy:\nLipstick... I'd like to wear lipstick someday.\nApollo:\nOh? You don't use lipstick yet, Trucy?\nTrucy:\nDaddy won't let me. \"Not until I learn to play piano,\" he says.\nApollo:\nYou'll be waiting a long time then, I'm afraid.\nPolice uniform\nApollo:\nA police uniform hangs on the stand here.\nTrucy:\nOoh! I want to try it on! \"Nothing to see here, move along.\"\nApollo:\n...It's OK, you don't have to go that far to be \"special\". I mean, you're not exactly the type who's \"just another face in the crowd\".\nTrucy:\nReally? You think so? Hmm... I guess you're right!\nApollo:\n(...Now I feel like a meanie for making that insinuation.)\nPostcards\nTrucy:\nLook! It's a postcard of Lamiroir!\nApollo:\nWhat are these letters at the bottom? I've never seen these before.\nTrucy:\nIt must be her native tongue, Borginian! (Changed from [It must be her native tongue, Borginese!] in the original release)\nApollo:\nBorginian, huh...? (Changed from [Borginese, huh...?] in the original release)\nPostcard added to the Court Record.\nPostcards (subsequent times)\nApollo:\nIt's a stack of Lamiroir's postcards. They have an air of mystery to them that matches her voice.\nRed Badger Guitar\nTrucy:\nThat guitar! That's the legendary AA-400! The \"Red Badger\".\nApollo:\nI thought rock was supposed to be rebellious, not... civic.\nTrucy:\nEvery aspiring guitarist wants one of these! They even paint their own guitars to look like it.\nApollo:\nAh, the fickleness of youth.\nTrucy:\nYou should dye your hair \"Badger Red\", too!\nApollo:\nI like my hair the way it is, thank you very much.\nTrucy:\nArgh, the stubbornness of age!\nSpeaker\nApollo:\nThat speaker looks familiar.\nTrucy:\nOh?\nApollo:\nYeah, like the one for the P.A. system back in school.\nTrucy:\nOh, we have one of those in my classroom, too!\nApollo:\n(That's right, she's still in junior high. ...I feel old.)\nWall poster\nApollo:\nWhat's a police recruitment poster doing here? \"Rock on ...with the police.\"\nTrucy:\nMaybe they're trying to trick kids into thinking the police are some kind of band.\nApollo:\nBut that's just silly. Who'd name a band the \"police\"?\nMove\nTrucy:\nApollo! Where do you think you're going!?\nApollo:\nHuh? Oh, I was just...\nTrucy:\nLet's talk to Mr. Gavin while we have the chance!\nApollo:\n(OK, I suppose...)\nTalk\nThe flaming guitar\nTrucy:\nYou mean, the guitar... That wasn't part of the act?\nKlavier:\nPart of the act!? Who'd burn up a guitar on purpose!?\nTrucy:\nBut, it worked really well with the lyrics just then... Burning on in my heart. Fire. Burn my love away. All away.\nKlavier:\n...... ! Wait, you think the audience thought it was...?\nApollo:\n(Sounds like he got lucky.)\nTrucy:\nThey probably thought it was part of the act. At least, I did.\nKlavier:\n......\nApollo:\n(He got lucky, and he didn't realize it...)\nKlavier:\nA-Anyway, that guitar was the Ferrari of guitars! All the speed, all the sound ...and all the price. If I burned one of those at every show I'd go broke!\nApollo:\nUnusually frugal for a rock band.\nTrucy:\nTry saying that to Mr. Gavin.\nKlavier:\nAchtung! Today's been one disaster after another... My hog won't run, my guitar case's broken...\nTrucy:\nDaddy told me there'd be days like these.\nLamiroir's song\nTrucy:\nW-Wasn't Lamiroir's song incredible!? You worked on it too, right, Mr. Gavin?\nKlavier:\nAh, yes, thanks. It was a collaboration. I wrote the lyrics, and she wrote the melody.\nTrucy:\nYou know... I was surprised she could sing in English...\nKlavier:\nI'm sure she practiced a long time for this day. Ah, here.\nApollo:\nWhat's this...?\nKlavier:\nA lyrics sheet. It's yours. Signed by myself and Lamiroir.\nTrucy:\nYippee! Thanks so much!\nApollo:\n(All I ever get to sign are client defense agreements.)\nLyrics Sheet added to the Court Record.\nLamiroir's song (subsequent times)\nKlavier:\nFor that song, I wrote the lyrics and she wrote the melody. It was a collaboration.\nTrucy:\nThat's so cool... I'd love to do a collaboration myself some day, or a song...\nApollo:\nYou can't do a collaboration alone, you know, Trucy.\nTrucy:\nI know that!\nKlavier:\nThen practice singing those lyrics. If you get good, I'll invite you into the band.\nTrucy:\nEeeek! R-Really!? I'll sing 'em every day!\nApollo:\nWhat about your magic act?\nTrucy:\n...... Maybe I can be a singing and dancing magician!\nApollo:\nThen you'd end up only being average in both, no?\nKlavier:\nNot at all. Why, I'm a rock star and a star prosecutor.\nApollo:\nUrk! (That's right, he is. I'd totally forgotten.)\nTrucy:\nOoh! See, you can excel in more than one thing!\nApollo:\n(Ugh... I'm having trouble enough with just one thing.)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nKlavier:\n...... Herr Forehead.\nApollo:\nY-Yeah?\nKlavier:\nUnderstand that I am not Prosecutor Gavin now. I am lead vocal of the Gavinners. That badge sings a different song... on a different stage.\nApollo:\nRight... (I wish I had an alter-ego to hide behind sometimes.)\nPostcard\nApollo:\nWhat are those postcards there, Prosecutor Gavin?\nKlavier:\nEh? Lamiroir's, you mean? It's part of her PR campaign. I received a stack. You can have one if you'd like.\nApollo:\n...Ah, that's good to hear. Trucy already swiped one, is why.\nTrucy:\nEh! B-But that... But I... ... What's the big idea!? Making me look like a criminal... It was... a collaboration! I've always wanted to do a collaboration!\nKlavier:\nUsually, a collaboration is for creating, not stealing.\nApollo:\n...Let the kid dream.\nLyrics Sheet\nKlavier:\nI wrote those lyrics, you know. Though it was Lamiroir who gave them life.\nTrucy:\nWow... That's beautiful!\nApollo:\n(Grr. Maybe I should try to write some lyrics someday.)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nKlavier:\nAlmost time for the third act of the night.\nTrucy:\nOh! There's more?\nKlavier:\nYes! Lamiroir's part is done. Now it's time for us to drop our groove again, ja? Hope you're ready to catch it.\nTrucy:\nWoo hoo! Ready, Apollo?\nApollo:\nUh... I think I'll pass.\nTrucy:\nEh.\nApollo:\nI liked the bit with Lamiroir. But the rest could use a volume knob. Turned way down.\nTrucy:\nAh, Apollo, you're getting old!\nApollo:\nAck! (Does 22 quality as \"old\" to a 15-year-old...?)\nTrucy:\nWell, I'm going!\nKlavier:\nLet the old folks rest backstage, ja? ...Time to rock.\nApollo:\n(Hey, you're older than I am!)\nExamine\nBlack gloves\nApollo:\nThick leather gloves and sunglasses... Maybe I'll try these on... ...On second thought, no. They might be evidence for one of Prosecutor Gavin's cases.\nBowl of stew\nApollo:\nA delicious bowl of stew! ...Made of plastic. Huh, the bottom of the bowl has a \"G\" on it. They sell these at concerts? Whatever happened to T-shirts?\nChains\nApollo:\nChains dangle from the ceiling. They aren't \"glimmerous\", but I bet Detective Skye'd have something to say about them.\nCruiser Guitar\nApollo:\nThat guitar looks like it was made out of a cop car door. ...... That's right. Trucy's not here to set me straight. Now I feel kinda lonely.\nLipstick on mirror\nApollo:\nThere's graffiti on the mirror... in lipstick. Wait, but the Gavinners are all guys. ...Maybe Prosecutor Gavin wears lipstick?\nPolice uniform\nApollo:\nA police uniform. Next to it is a policeman's hat, and a pair of handcuffs. One of the band members must like the police. Must be Mr. Gavin's \"bad influence\". ...... I thought rock 'n' roll was all about being rebellious.\nPostcards\nApollo:\nA postcard of Lamiroir... I can't read a single word of the sentence at the bottom. Hmm. Trucy might want one of these. I'll show it to her next time we're here.\nRed Badger Guitar\nApollo:\nThat's an odd guitar. The design is that character I saw in the hallway, but with sunglasses. What a strange mascot. He looks like he's crying. Since when was rock about crying? ...They should name this guy \"Emo\".\nSpeaker\nApollo:\nAn old-fashioned speaker hangs from the ceiling. That must be to monitor what's happening out on stage. I think we had the same kind for my school's P.A. system.\nWall poster\nApollo:\n...That police officer looks ready to rock. Some kids must see this and actually want to be cops. Somehow I don't think a rocking defense attorney would work too well.\nJuly 7Backstage Hallway\nEma:\nHey, it's you! That Wright kid.\nApollo:\nDetective Skye! (I'll let that \"Wright kid\" business pass.)\nEma:\nCall me Ema. There's no need for titles once you've shared a bottle of fingerprinting powder!\nApollo:\nThat's a new one. So, um, Ema, what are you doing here?\nEma:\n...Isn't it obvious? I'm snacking. You think I want to be here!? Me, in charge of security in this pit!?\nApollo:\nSecurity...? Did something happen?\nEma:\nThere's no knowing with that glimmerous fop. Apparently, he's all upset because something was stolen. He wanted security back here during the concert. Where does he get off acting like he's some big rock star?\nApollo:\n(...He is a big rock star.)\nEma:\nHey! You listening to me?\nApollo:\nSo... Where's this door here lead to?\nEma:\nThis one? That's Lamiroir's dressing room. Don't even think of going in there unless you want a piece of Snackoos in your face!\nApollo:\n(Is she ever in a good mood, I wonder?)\nExamine\nBlue Badger doll\nApollo:\nWhat's that odd looking doll doing there?\nEma:\nMUNCH MUNCH... oh, MUNCH, that's the Blue MUNCH Badger.\nApollo:\nCould you try either talking or munching, but not both?\n*ka-tonk*\nApollo:\n(She hit me with a snack.)\nEma:\nServes me MUNCH right MUNCH for going MUNCH out MUNCH of MUNCH my MUNCH way MUNCH\nApollo:\n...... (Sorry, I don't speak Snackoos.)\nEma:\nMUNCH MUNCH MUNCH.\nEarpiece\nApollo:\nWhat's this? Some kind of headset earpiece?\nEma:\nMUNCH MUNCH MUNCH.\nApollo:\nWhy would someone leave this in the hallway?\nEma:\nMUNCH MUNCH MUNCH.\nApollo:\nMaybe Lamiroir's bodyguard dropped it?\nEma:\nMUNCH MUNCH MUNCH.\nApollo:\nEma! Will you stop eating those snacks for one second and listen!?\nEma:\nHah! If you think you're going to pull me away from my snacks just to hear you mumbling... ...on and on about whatever, you're going to be sorely disappointed!\nApollo:\n(...At least I got her to stop munching.)\nInstrument trunk\nApollo:\nThat's a pretty sturdy-looking box there. Maybe it's an instrument case. There's a guitar next to it.\nEma:\nDon't even think about taking that!\nApollo:\nI don't think I could even carry it...\n*ka-tonk*\nApollo:\n(She Snackoo'd me.)\n\"Dressing #1\" door\nApollo:\nThat's Prosecutor Gavin's... er, the Gavinners's dressing room.\nEma:\nPut so much as a hand on the door and I'll Snackoo you.\nApollo:\nHold on! But I just came out of there!\nEma:\nDon't play smart with me!\nApollo:\n(*sigh*)\n\"Dressing #2\" door\nLeads to:\n\"So this is Lamiroir's dressing room.\"\nVending machine\nApollo:\nCome to think of it, I am a little thirsty.\nEma:\nI'll have some tea.\nApollo:\n...... I think I'll get a water.\nEma:\nI'll have tea!\nApollo:\nIf you want tea so bad go buy it yourself!\n*ka-tonk*\nApollo:\n(She Snackoo'd me.)\nEma:\nI'll take a tea.\nWall poster\nApollo:\nA Gavinners \"Guilty As Charged\" tour poster.\nEma:\nThey're plastered all over the place. It's annoying.\nApollo:\nWell, this is the concert venue. It makes sense.\nEma:\nWhy? Everyone here is already here! Why advertise to them?\nApollo:\nPeople like to see the poster at the concert... It's part of the experience.\nEma:\nDo you have to find fault with everything I say?\n*ka-tonk*\nApollo:\n(She Snackoo'd me.)\nTalk\nAny option\nApollo:\nUm... Ema?\nEma:\nMUNCH MUNCH MUNCH.\nApollo:\n(I've never seen someone eat snacks with such vehemence. Better give her a wide berth...)\n*ka-tonk*\nApollo:\n(She Snackoo'd me.)\nPresent\nAnything\nApollo:\nEma, could you take a look at this?\nEma:\nMUNCH MUNCH MUNCH.\nApollo:\nUm... What do you think?\nEma:\nMUNCH MUNCH MUNCH.\nApollo:\n(That must be a bottomless bag of snacks.)\nApollo:\nSo this is Lamiroir's dressing room.\nEma:\nIf you even think about going in there, I'll--\n...BANG...!\nApollo:\n......\nEma:\n......\nApollo:\nWhat was that?\n...BANG...!\nApollo:\nWas that... a gunshot?\n...CRASH...!\nApollo:\n(Something's going on!)\nEma:\nYou, out of my way!\nApollo:\nE-Ema!\nEma:\nLamiroir! Lamiroir!\n......\nEma:\nIt's not locked... I'm going in!\nJuly 7, 9:30 PMLamiroir's Dressing Room\nApollo:\n(What's that awful noise... Oh, it's the concert.) Aaack! That's-- (It's Lamiroir's manager! Mister what's-his-name...)\nEma:\nLeTouse! Oh no... Hey, you!\nApollo:\nM-Me?\nEma:\nWatch this room for me. I have to call for backup!\nApollo:\nR-Right, understood. You want me to make sure no one comes in, right?\nEma:\nAnd don't touch anything! I'll be right back!\nApollo:\n(...What's going on? I just talked to him, and now...)\nLeTouse:\n......Nnnh......\nApollo:\n...! (He... He's alive!) Mr. LeTouse! Can you hear me!?\nLeTouse:\n...Sh...Shot. ...I was...shot.\nApollo:\nWho? Who shot you!?\nLeTouse:\n...I don't know... Ask...\nApollo:\nAsk? Ask what?\nLeTouse:\nAsk... wi...witness...\nApollo:\nWitness... There was a witness!? Who!?\nLeTouse:\n...Cold... so cold... Witness...\nApollo:\nYou're cold? D-Don't worry, you're going to be fine! Help is on the way!\nLeTouse:\n...Can't s...see...\nApollo:\nHang in there, Mr. LeTouse! Tell me, who was the witness?\nLeTouse:\nThe wi...witness...is ...si...si...ren...\nApollo:\n(...\"Siren\"? How can a siren witness anything...?) Mr. LeTouse! Yipes! Ema!? (What was that!?) Wh-Who's there!?\nEma:\nWhat's wrong?\nApollo:\nEma! Did you see anyone just now!?\nEma:\nHuh? No...\nApollo:\n(I could have sworn I heard a door close...)\nEma:\nThe concert's been cancelled. Backup's on its way. Is Mr. LeTouse... ...He's dead, isn't he? That's terrible.\nApollo:\n...! (I lost him!)\nApollo:\n(Romein LeTouse... shot. And I heard his last words... \"The witness is the siren\"... Whatever that means.)\nJuly 7Backstage Hallway\n???:\nThe venue's locked down. We took names and addresses before letting the crowd go.\nKlavier:\nGood work, Daryan.\n???:\nI'll let you know if I find out anything about the victim. Later.\nKlavier:\nIt's investigation time, then, ja, Fräulein Detective?\nEma:\nI don't need some rock 'n' rolling prosecutor to tell me that.\nKlavier:\nOne request I must make... Tell no one, on staff or otherwise, anything of this.\nTrucy:\nOoh, a gag order!\nKlavier:\nNo word gets out, other than that Mr. LeTouse is dead. No word of the cause of death, or of the murder.\nApollo:\nTell no one... Not even Lamiroir?\nKlavier:\nNot even her. We must keep everything under wraps. Oh, one other thing. I'll need your signature on this, Herr Forehead. Yours too, Fräulein.\nApollo:\nOn that? Hmm... An \"Investigation Request\"...?\nTrucy:\nWhy just us?\nKlavier:\nYou two are civilians. It's standard procedure.\nApollo:\n(That should be OK to sign, I think...)\nSigned Prosecutor Gavin's Investigation Request.\nKlavier:\nRight, well, get started with the investigation!\nEma:\nI'm on it already!\nKlavier:\nAh, and one tip for you.\nApollo:\nHuh? Me?\nKlavier:\nTry not to get in the Fräulein detective's way. ...She's in a foul mood today.\nApollo:\n(Gee, I wonder why...)\nApollo:\n(We were all questioned as witnesses... ...And now none of us can go home. We'll investigate alright. ...Our way!)\nTrucy:\n...Somehow I don't see us getting back to that crime scene any time soon.\nApollo:\nI still can't believe I was there when it happened. Not an experience I care to repeat any time soon.\nTrucy:\nThis is no time for navel-gazing! Let's crack this case!\nApollo:\n(I worry about Trucy. She seems to have a very loose idea of what it means to be an \"attorney\". Of course, that's not surprising considering who her father is...)\nTrucy:\nSomething the matter?\nApollo:\nNo... Let's get cracking!\nApollo:\n(I'm the only one who was there... The only one who heard Mr. LeTouse's last words.)\nLeTouse:\nThe wi...witness...is ...si...si...ren...\nApollo:\n(First order of business is to find out what he meant by \"siren\"!)\nExamine\nBlue Badger doll\nTrucy:\nThat's the Blue Badger, the police mascot!\nApollo:\nDoes the Blue Badger have something to do with the band?\nTrucy:\nWell, yeah! The Blue Badger is the Gavinners's mascot, too!\nApollo:\nHuh. Go figure.\nTrucy:\nI hear those things fly off the shelves.\nApollo:\n(I'll have to take a closer look at one some day.)\nEarpiece\nTrucy:\nWhat's that? It looks like some kind of future-phone!\nApollo:\nNot a phone, a transceiver. It's called a \"headset\".\nTrucy:\nWhat's a headset doing on the floor? Wait! Do you think Mr. LeTouse might have been wearing it? Like one of those bodyguards?\nApollo:\nHmm. I don't think he was wearing one when we first met. (The L.E.D. on this thing is lit. It must be on.)\nInstrument trunk\nApollo:\nLooks like an instrument case. A big instrument case.\nTrucy:\nThere's a great magic trick you can do with one of these!\nApollo:\nHuh? What kind?\nTrucy:\nThe \"Miraculous Beautiful Girl Escapes the Case\" illusion.\nApollo:\nSo it's the girl who's miraculous, not the escape?\nTrucy:\nSo picky!\n\"Dressing #1\" door\nApollo:\nThat's the Gavinners's dressing room. The crime scene was Lamiroir's dressing room... ...Next door.\nTrucy:\nNever know where clues might be hiding, Apollo! Let's case this joint!\nApollo:\n(After you, Trucy, P.I.)\n\"Dressing #2\" door\nApollo:\nLamiroir's dressing room...\nTrucy:\nThe scene of the crime!\nApollo:\nWe're not supposed to go in there.\nTrucy:\nBut aren't we involved? Aren't we duty-bound to investigate!?\nApollo:\nSadly, no. (Though, the situation being what it is... Now may be our best chance to do some snooping...)\nVending machine\nTrucy:\nI'm thirsty, Apollo!\nApollo:\n...Want something to drink?\nTrucy:\nHmm... How about... this one! A Steel Samurai Soda!\nApollo:\n(\"Now in Real Steel flavor.\") ...Hmm.\nTrucy:\nHuh?\nApollo:\n...Here, my treat.\nTrucy:\nHey! This isn't enough change.\nApollo:\nThe machines outside are cheaper. This one is highway robbery.\nWall poster\nApollo:\nA concert poster for the \"Guilty as Charged\" Tour.\nTrucy:\nI love that name! \"Guilty As Charged\"!\nApollo:\n...Seems kind of negative to me.\nTrucy:\nWell, why don't we do the opposite! Magician Trucy presents the \"Innocent as Charged\" tour!\nApollo:\nIt kind of loses its impact, doesn't it?\nJuly 7Gavinners's Dressing Room\nTrucy:\nHuh. Looks like nobody's here.\nApollo:\nProsecutor Gavin's probably busy with the case, too. No rest for the wicked.\nTrucy:\nNo rest for us, either, Apollo! Let's get rocking! Rock, rock!\nJuly 7In the Wings\nTrucy:\nHmm. The stage looks empty.\nApollo:\nI was hoping to get a chance to talk to Prosecutor Gavin...\nTrucy:\nOh well. Nothing to do but go to the crime scene, I guess!\nApollo:\nI guess...\nExamine\nComputer\nApollo:\nLook at all these electronic devices. I'm guessing they have something to do with sound.\nTrucy:\nWhy guess when we can fiddle? Hmm... let's see here...\nApollo:\nDon't touch that!\nTrucy:\nA healthy curiosity is the key to a good investigation! When in doubt, fiddle! That's what Daddy always says.\nApollo:\n(They should require parental testing, clearly...)\nGuitar case\nApollo:\nNow that's a big instrument case.\nTrucy:\nThat's a case for a contrabass, I think.\nApollo:\nYou could fit twenty violins in there, I bet.\nTrucy:\nIt may look like a violin, but it's a completely different instrument!\nApollo:\nYou could fit five Trucys in there, I bet.\nTrucy:\nHey! Are you comparing me to an instrument? Hmm. I wonder who left it sitting open like that.\n(Step)ladder\nApollo:\nLook, a ladder. I guess they need one to work on the lights and such.\nTrucy:\nWhy don't they use a stepladder? I prefer stepladders, really. ...Is that so wrong?\nApollo:\nNot wrong, just... well, why do you prefer stepladders?\nTrucy:\n...... They're so much more flexible than plain old ladders!\nApollo:\n...... (I prefer my ladders rigid and stable, thank you.)\nPiano\nTrucy:\nWow, that piano looks much bigger close up! Machi played so beautifully...\nApollo:\nYeah, like a real pianist.\nTrucy:\nThat's just silly, Apollo! How can you call someone as good as Machi a \"pianist\"? Why, that's like throwing him in the same class as Daddy!\nApollo:\n...Good thing Mr. Wright didn't hear that one.\nStage\nTrucy:\nWhat a big stage! It's on a whole other scale than the Wonder Bar!\nApollo:\nThe lights were so bright I couldn't see the whole first part of the concert.\nTrucy:\nI'd love to do my act on a stage like this some day!\nApollo:\nJust hold back on the lights, for my eyes' sake, please.\nTrucy:\nYou'll be too blinded by my magic to worry about lights!\nApollo:\nYou probably don't want to blind the audience if you plan on showing them magic.\nJuly 7Lamiroir's Dressing Room\nEma:\nOh, it's you. I figured you'd come.\nApollo:\nYou have to let us investigate the scene, please!\nEma:\nYou're attorneys, no? Shouldn't you wait until you have a client...?\nApollo:\n(LeTouse did tell me to ask the witness, the siren... ...With his dying breath, no less. Doesn't that count?)\nEma:\n...G-Glare at me all you want, you'll get no snacks from me.\nTrucy:\nPlease! Think of poor Lamiroir!\nEma:\nHmph. Oh well, I suppose. You did find the body with me.\nApollo:\nGreat! Let's get to it!\nTrucy:\nRight!\nEma:\nJust try not to touch anything!\nApollo:\n(She's letting us look! And she's not munching her snacks! This bodes well. There are clues here, I can feel it! Leave no hanger unhung, no spot unspotted!)\nExamine\nAir vent\nApollo:\n......\nTrucy:\nWhat's wrong, Apollo? Your mouth is catching flies.\nApollo:\nAh? Um, nothing. It's nothing.\nEma:\n\"Maybe that's how the killer escaped.\" ...That's what you were thinking, right?\nApollo:\nEh.\nEma:\nWhen we arrived on the scene, the killer had already fled. He or she must have had a way out. And that air vent is one possibility.\nTrucy:\nBut it's much too small.\nApollo:\nHmm... Not if the killer were about your size, Trucy...\nTrucy:\n......\nApollo:\n......\nTrucy:\nI didn't do it!\nApollo:\nEh.\nTrucy:\nI was cutting up the dance floor at the time, thank you!\nApollo:\nI know, I know! Of course I don't think you did it.\nTrucy:\nIt's hard to tell with you, sometimes, Apollo.\nApollo:\n(Hey! What have I done?)\nBrooch\nTrucy:\nOoh, what a pretty brooch! Oh, Ema...?\nEma:\nYou're not going to say, \"Can I have it, please,\" are you?\nTrucy:\nOh.\nEma:\nLook you may be a cute little girl of fifteen... ...but that doesn't get you any special treatment with me!\nTrucy:\nOh...\nApollo:\nIt's not healthy to envy the young, Ema.\nEma:\nIt's not about envy! It's about tampering with evidence!\nApollo:\n(Note to self: Ema lacks a sense of humor. Use caution.)\nEma:\nYou need to learn to respect your elders a little!\nApollo:\n(...Something seems so familiar about that brooch.)\nBrooch added to the Court Record.\nBrooch (subsequent times)\nTrucy:\n......\nApollo:\n(Trucy's still after that brooch, clearly...)\nEma:\nNo way! If you want one that bad, get your daddy to buy it for you!\nTrucy:\nDaddy always says: \"Trucy, if you want something go find or borrow it.\" Oh, and \"When in doubt, beg.\"\nEma:\nLeave it to Mr. Wright...\nApollo:\n(I'm a little concerned for Trucy's future... But I'm more concerned about the owner of that brooch.)\nBullet holes\nTrucy:\nAre these... bullet holes?\nApollo:\nLooks like it. There are two here in the wall.\nEma:\nFrom the look of it, the victim was shot once in the shoulder. The first shot must have missed.\nTrucy:\nBut there are two holes. Wouldn't that mean two misses?\nEma:\nThe murder weapon is a 45-caliber revolver. It's very powerful. I believe what we're seeing here... ...is the mark left by the second bullet after it passed through his shoulder!\nTrucy:\nOuch... Sounds painful.\nApollo:\n(No kidding. I wonder about this murder weapon...)\nFruit basket\nTrucy:\nOoh! Apollo! Can I eat some of those, please!?\nEma:\nAbsolutely not!\nTrucy:\nI know. I know! But still, I yearn!\nEma:\nLook, you're not the only one eyeing that fruit here.\nTrucy:\nWell then, what are we waiting for? Let's eat!\nEma:\nRight!\nApollo:\nWhoa whoa whoa! Stop it! Are you two crazy? Ema, you of all people should know better...\nEma:\nBut she tempted me! She's a... She's a temptress!\nApollo:\n(Please, grow up...)\n(Step)ladder\nApollo:\nHuh, another ladder.\nTrucy:\nActually, it's technically a stepladder.\nApollo:\nWell hello, Ms. Fancy Pants! Please forgive my lack of ladder discrimination.\nTrucy:\n! ......\nEma:\nI'm less worried about the stepladder, and more worried about why it's there.\nApollo:\n(Why is the ladder there? Well, to climb, right? To reach something on the ceiling?)\nTrucy:\n...... I still say it's a stepladder.\nPoster right of TV\nApollo:\nWhat's this poster...?\nTrucy:\nLet's see... \"This Summer: A Legal Eagles Production of 'Case Closed'.\" ...Looks like a poster for a different show.\nApollo:\n...One I wouldn't mind seeing real soon.\nPoster above TV\nApollo:\nThere's another Gavinners poster here.\nEma:\nI'm just about sick of seeing those, personally. Maybe I'll tear it down! Ha ha!\nApollo:\nNo tampering with the crime scene, Ema!\nEma:\nHmph. Maybe there's something else I can tear to shreds...\nTrucy:\nD-Don't look at me!\nSpeaker\nApollo:\nThat speaker was blaring at the time of the murder...\nEma:\nAh, that's for monitoring the stage from this room.\nTrucy:\nMonitoring?\nEma:\nIt pipes in a real-time feed from the stage microphones. Useful for knowing when your set is coming up.\nApollo:\nYes, I seem to recall it being loud and vaguely musical. (It made it hard to hear Mr. LeTouse's last words.)\nTelevision\nTrucy:\nAh, ah, Apollo! Look at that thing! It's huge! That... That's a TV!!!\nApollo:\nUm, yeah, a wide flatscreen TV. I want one of those.\nEma:\nYou'll be wanting for a long time on your salary, junior. Wait till you're as famous as Mr. Wright was, then dream.\nTrucy:\nI don't think Daddy was ever rich, even when he was in law.\nApollo:\nGreat, just stomp on my dreams why don't you.\nFlower bouquet\nApollo:\nWhat an amazing bouquet. I mean, it's giant.\nEma:\nNot sure I approve. It'd be better if this flower was a bit more... Oh.\nTrucy:\nEek! The flower fell off!\nApollo:\nWhat happened to preserving the crime scene, Ema?\nEma:\nIt's fine! Fine! I'll just put it back, see?\nApollo:\n(How scientific...)\nHairdryer\nApollo:\nThis is one of those... uh, things, right? At the barbers?\nEma:\nA permanent dryer. Want me to curl those bangs of yours?\nApollo:\nUm, no thanks.\nTrucy:\nBetter not mess with his hair, Ema. It's part of his identity, you know.\nRomein LeTouse's body\nTrucy:\nTh-That's a body, isn't it?\nEma:\nSure is. The victim, no less. Let's take a closer look.\nTrucy:\nEeek! G-Go ahead, Apollo. You first.\nApollo:\nMe!? No, you should go first, Trucy, really...\nEma:\nWill you two stop bickering and get over here!?\nApollo:\n(She's munching on Snackoos again. Hope she's not too annoyed.)\nRomein LeTouse's left hand\nTrucy:\nApollo, look at this hand...\nApollo:\nHmm. He's holding something.\nEma:\nHey! No touching!\nApollo:\nYou can throw all the snacks at me you'd like, Ema. But sooner or later... you're going to run out of them.\nEma:\nHmm. You raise a good point. ...I'm a bit intrigued by this scene. Let's take a look.\nTrucy:\nAh... see there? He's holding something! What's this...?\nApollo:\n...A key ring?\nTrucy:\nYou think it might belong to the killer!?\nEma:\nCertainly a possibility...\nApollo:\n(What an unusual key ring... And what unusual keys. This could be a vital clue.)\nKey Ring added to the Court Record.\nRomein LeTouse's left hand (subsequent times)\nApollo:\nThe body was holding a key ring...\nEma:\nI wonder what it could mean?\nTrucy:\nIt must mean something!\nApollo:\nIt doesn't look like the kind Mr. LeTouse would use. So the question is, whose key ring is it?\nEma:\nWell, you're practically a detective there, Apollo.\nTrucy:\nPractically!\nApollo:\n...... (I'm glad it brings them so much joy to mock me.)\nSmeared blood\nTrucy:\nEeek! Is that... blood? Umm... Why don't you examine this one, Apollo. You know more about, uh, red stuff than I do. Yep!\nApollo:\n...Says who? (Something is strange about this blood, though... Is that what it looks like?)\nMirror dresser\nApollo:\nSeeing these mirrors lined up like that makes me think I'm really in a dressing room.\nEma:\nYou are in a dressing room. Hmm... This must be makeup. ...I've never heard of most of these brands.\nEma:\nMaybe they're Borginian?\nTrucy:\nWell, I haven't got a clue, and I doubt those are.\nGift boxes\nApollo:\nLook at all these presents. Lamiroir sure is popular.\nTrucy:\nOoh! I wonder what's inside? We... can't open them, can we?\nEma:\nProbably not a good idea. You never know what you might find in one of these boxes. Bombs, razors, ransom notes... It could be anything.\nTrucy:\n...... I'm never having a birthday party again.\nRevolver\nApollo:\nThis is the murder weapon, isn't it? This revolver...?\nEma:\nThat's right. A big 45-caliber revolver.\nTrucy:\nWow. I wonder who brought this in here? I thought only police were allowed to have one of those.\nApollo:\n......\nEma:\nWhy are you giving me that look!? I didn't do it!\nApollo:\nI didn't...\nEma:\nListen, I was out in the hall eating Snackoos when it happened!\nApollo:\nI know, I know! No one here thinks you did it, Ema.\nEma:\nIt's hard to tell with you, sometimes, Apollo.\nApollo:\n(Hey! What have I done?)\nTrucy:\nWait... If the killer brought a revolver... ...it must mean they had planned this from the start. That's right, right?\nRevolver added to the Court Record.\nRevolver (subsequent times)\nApollo:\nA 45-caliber revolver, very deadly.\nTrucy:\nYou know, Apollo, I was wondering... What's a caliber? And what does the \"45\" mean?\nApollo:\nHuh?\nEma:\nHeh, you want me to tell you? It's the size of the barrel. Simply put, the larger the caliber, the bigger the round. ...The bullet, in other words. Bigger bullets do more damage.\nApollo:\nWow, chalk one point up for forensic science.\nEma:\nYou know it!\nTrucy:\n...But it's not 45 inches, right? That'd be too big. What's the unit of measurement they use, Ms. Science? Well?\nEma:\n...... Hush. Kids shouldn't ask so many questions.\nSmall window\nTrucy:\nLook, there's a little window over here! Maybe the killer escaped through that!\nApollo:\nIt's barely big enough for me to get my head through.\nEma:\nNot to mention it only opens a crack.\nTrucy:\n...What? I was just saying it's possible.\nApollo:\nRight, right, no harm in that. (Except I'm pretty sure it is impossible.)\nEma:\nYou could peek into the room through it, though, you know.\nTalk\nThe victim\nEma:\nMr. \"Romein LeTouse\", wasn't it? He was Lamiroir's manager. And interpreter, apparently. This was his first time in the country.\nTrucy:\nHmm... So I'm guessing he didn't know many people here.\nEma:\nIt doesn't seem likely. Nor can I think of anyone with a motive to murder him. ...Except for one person, of course.\nTrucy:\nOne person...? Who?\nApollo:\nLamiroir. No one here might have had a motive, but she's from...\nTrucy:\nWhat are you talking about!?\nApollo:\nUrk! H-Hey, it was Ema's idea!\nEma:\nI said nothing. MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH.\nApollo:\n(Always with the snacks...)\nTrucy:\nHe's a big man. Or was. I don't think even I would win in a fight with him.\nApollo:\nWhich is why whoever it was used a revolver, I'm guessing.\nEma:\nWe've sent a request to the Borginian Embassy for more info on him.\nThe crime\nEma:\nWell, you and I know more about the crime than anyone.\nTrucy:\nY-You do?\nApollo:\nThat's true. It was us who found the body.\nTrucy:\nWhaaaa-!? Hmph. I guess that's what I miss for watching the concert.\nApollo:\nHey, I wish I was watching the concert. ...Anything would be better than this.\nEma:\nWell, we know the crime took place during the concert.\nApollo:\nAnd when we heard the shot and entered the room... ...the killer was already gone.\nTrucy:\nWhat? But that doesn't make sense! You came in when you heard the shot and no one was here? How did they leave the room?\nApollo:\nHmm, that window is a little too small, isn't it?\nEma:\n......\nApollo:\n(The mystery of the disappearing killer...)\nThe murder weapon (appears after presenting Revolver)\nEma:\nWhat do you think about this revolver?\nApollo:\nWell... it's pretty big. And heavy.\nEma:\nThat's right. It's a 45-caliber. That makes it one of the deadliest revolvers around. Even the police don't carry guns this big.\nApollo:\nReally?\nEma:\nYeah. It doesn't make sense... You don't need so much power to kill at such close range. ...It's overkill.\nTrucy:\nI'm not sure I see the problem. I mean, whenever I go out to eat curry... ...I order it \"extra spicy\". Just to be sure it's spicy. Of course, I can only ever eat one or two bites.\nApollo:\n...Um, and that's not a problem?\nEma:\nThere's another thing about a gun this big. It puts a lot of strain on the shooter.\nApollo:\nStrain...?\nEma:\nYeah. Say, if you were to fire this revolver... ...the recoil would probably dislocate your shoulder.\nTrucy:\nOuuuuuch! It's like the shooter's a victim, too!\nEma:\nYet, the killer used this revolver, and quite well. I'm guessing whoever did it was used to shooting.\nApollo:\n(Used to shooting a high-caliber weapon? Hmm...)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nEma:\nYou always carry that around, do you? ...Just like Mr. Wright.\nApollo:\nHuh?\nEma:\nIt's good to never let yourself forget who you are. I'm proud of you. Keep up the good work.\nApollo:\n(...Come to think of it, why do I carry this around? Though I suppose that's one compliment it's got me.)\nRevolver\nApollo:\nSo this... is the murder weapon? (This revolver is incredibly heavy!)\nEma:\nIt's been fired twice. You can still smell the gunpowder... ...That's odd.\nApollo:\nWhat's odd?\nEma:\nHmm? Oh, nothing.\nTrucy:\nHey, no fair! Tell us!\nEma:\nIt's just, something about this revolver seems... strange.\nApollo:\nStrange...?\nAnything else\nEma:\nHmm, sorry. I can't comment on anything not scientifically relevant. I am a forensic scientist after all.\nApollo:\n(A self-styled one, at least.)\nExamine evidence\nBrooch\nBack side\nApollo:\nA sort of pin-fastener for attaching things to clothes. Not a safety pin-type, though.\nTrucy:\nSo if it's not a safety pin... ...is it a danger pin!?\nApollo:\nI suppose if you stuck it in your eye, then yeah, sure. But you could do that with a safety pin, too, for that matter.\nTrucy:\n...... Thanks for taking the fun out of my danger pin.\nApollo:\n(Aw, you're driving a danger pin through my heart here.)\nRevolver\nMuzzle\nApollo:\nYikes! Don't point that thing at me!\nTrucy:\nDon't worry! I'm an old hand with firearms. I have one that shoots \"Bullets\".\nApollo:\nI don't want it shooting any bullets, thank you!\nTrucy:\nNot those bullets, silly! My gun shoots \"Bullets, the Magic Cat\".\nApollo:\nA cat... comes out of a gun?\nTrucy:\nI can tell your expression you've never heard of that trick. It's a great one!\nApollo:\n(Honestly, That one sounds halfway interesting.)\nChamber\nApollo:\nThe middle of the weapon is a revolving chamber. That's where you load the bullets. A revolver, see?\nTrucy:\nRevolver... Revolver... That sounds a bit like \"Wonder Bar\"! Especially if you say it really fast!\nApollo:\nUh... I guess.\nTrucy:\nYou know what I always used to think? I used to think the closest sound to \"Wonder Bar\" was \"One Liver\"! There's just so many words in the world, Apollo! Isn't it amazing!?\nApollo:\n...... So many different words, so many different people. (...People like Trucy.)\nKey Ring\nGuitar-shaped key\nApollo:\nThere are three keys on this heart-shaped key ring. Hmm? This middle key is shaped like... a guitar?\nTrucy:\nI get it! It must be the key to a guitar case!\nApollo:\nA guitar case key... (I'll bet I know who this belongs to.)\nTrucy:\n...... Thanks for taking the fun out of my danger pin.\nApollo:\n(Aw, you're driving a danger pin through my heart here.)\nAfter clearing all Talk options and examining brooch and Romein LeTouse's left hand:\nEma:\nWell, that's about it. I think we've looked at just about everything there is.\nApollo:\nI guess you're right.\nEma:\nI know how you're feeling. It is hard to know when to stop. But anything more involved has to wait until the squad gets here.\nTrucy:\nArgh... I suppose...\nEma:\nI'll go report the evidence. Sorry, but could you wait here till I get back?\nApollo:\nHuh? Oh, actually, we have to--\nEma:\nGreat! Thanks!\nApollo:\n...She left.\nTrucy:\nWhat do we do, Apollo? She told us to wait...\nApollo:\nGreat. Now how am I supposed to investigate?\nTrucy:\nOh well, I guess it can't be helped. Let's go.\nApollo:\nHuh? Go?\nTrucy:\nTime's a wasting, Apollo! We've got a lot of ground to cover!\nApollo:\nWell, that's true, but... ...On second thought, why not. I'm sure everything will be fine.\nTrucy:\nOf course it will! Let's go!\nExamine\nAir vent\nApollo:\n...... That air vent bothers me. If Ema and I came in through the door... That makes that vent the only exit from the room.\nTrucy:\nBut it's much too small.\nApollo:\nHmm... Not if the killer were about your size, Trucy...\nTrucy:\n......\nApollo:\n......\nTrucy:\nI didn't do it!\nApollo:\nEh.\nTrucy:\nI was cutting up the dance floor at the time, thank you!\nApollo:\nI know, I know! Of course I don't think you did it.\nTrucy:\nIt's hard to tell with you, sometimes, Apollo.\nApollo:\n(Hey! What have I done?)\nBrooch\nTrucy:\n......\nApollo:\nNo snatching people's brooches.\nTrucy:\nDarn... Maybe there's another one lying around here somewhere.\nApollo:\nIf there is, you can't have that one either.\nTrucy:\n...Don't be so stingy, Apollo.\nApollo:\n...I think the word you're looking for is \"principled\".\nBullet holes\nTrucy:\nAre these... bullet holes?\nApollo:\nLooks like it. There are two here in the wall.\nTrucy:\nWell, if there are two marks, they must have missed twice.\nApollo:\nNot necessarily... Some revolvers can put a bullet through a person. So it wasn't necessarily a miss.\nTrucy:\nOuch... Sounds painful.\nFruit basket\nTrucy:\nOoh! Apollo! Can I eat some of those, please!?\nApollo:\nBetter not. Ema will find out. Somehow, she will. \"How could you eat those without telling me!?\"\nTrucy:\nYeah... I'll make sure to leave some for her to eat, too.\nApollo:\n(I don't think that's the issue here...)\n(Step)ladder\nApollo:\nHuh, another ladder.\nTrucy:\nActually, it's technically a stepladder.\nApollo:\nWell hello, Ms. Fancy Pants! Please forgive my lack of ladder discrimination.\nTrucy:\n! ......\nApollo:\nI'd say this ladder is used to climb up to reach things. ...Is there something on the ceiling?\nTrucy:\nI still say it's a stepladder.\nPoster over TV\nApollo:\nLook, there's another Gavinners poster. Ema didn't seem too happy about it.\nTrucy:\nMaybe I should take it down before she rips it up.\nApollo:\nYou walk around with that thing and she'll sniff it out.\nTrucy:\n...Maybe I'll pass then.\nApollo:\n(It's probably wise to be wary of Ema...)\nSpeaker\nApollo:\nThat speaker was blaring when it happened. Apparently, it monitors sound from the main stage. ...Which made it hard to hear Mr. LeTouse's last words.\nTrucy:\nWell, you know what I do at loud concerts? I wear earplugs! It really cuts down on the noise.\nApollo:\n...And this would have helped me hear him how?\nTelevision\nTrucy:\nAh, ah, Apollo! Look at that thing! It's huge! That... That's a TV!!!\nApollo:\nUm, yeah, a wide flatscreen TV. I want one of those. Someday when I'm a famous attorney, I'll get one...\nTrucy:\nBut Daddy never had one. I don't think he ever even had money when he was a lawyer.\nApollo:\nGreat, just stomp on my dreams why don't you.\nFlower bouquet\nApollo:\nWhat an amazing bouquet. I mean, it's giant.\nTrucy:\nThat's super dazzle-frazzle!\nApollo:\n...\"Dazzle-frazzle\"?\nTrucy:\nYeah, it's super, and it makes you feel all dazzle-frazzle!\nApollo:\nUm... Who taught you to say that?\nTrucy:\nOh, Daddy.\nApollo:\n(...I knew it.)\nHairdryer\nApollo:\nThis is one of those... uh, things, right? At the barbers? It's one of those permanent hair things.\nTrucy:\nI've never tried one.\nApollo:\nWant to?\nTrucy:\nHmm... I think I'll stick with my top hat. We have an understanding, me and my hat.\nApollo:\n(It's... just a hat, Trucy.)\nRomein LeTouse's body\nRomein LeTouse's left hand\nApollo:\nThe body was holding a key ring...\nTrucy:\nDo you think it belongs to the killer?\nApollo:\nIf it's not Mr. LeTouse's, that seems like a possibility.\nMirror dresser\nApollo:\nSeeing these mirrors lined up like that makes me think I'm really in a dressing room. Look at all that makeup.\nTrucy:\nWell, I haven't got a clue, and I doubt those are.\nApollo:\n(I guess she's not into makeup yet.)\nGift boxes\nApollo:\nLook at all these presents. Lamiroir sure is popular.\nTrucy:\nI got a present once, from a person in the audience.\nApollo:\nThat's pretty cool.\nTrucy:\nIsn't it! Maybe you'll get one someday. ...From someone you defend!\nApollo:\n(That's called getting paid, and I certainly hope I do.)\nRevolver\nApollo:\nA 45-caliber revolver, very powerful. This is definitely the murder weapon.\nTrucy:\nI wonder who brought this revolver in here? It's huge.\nApollo:\nSomeone unusual, that's for sure.\nTrucy:\nNo one I want to meet, that's also for sure.\nApollo:\nMe either. Unless it's in court, of course!\nSmall window\nTrucy:\nLook, there's a little window over here! Maybe the killer escaped through that!\nApollo:\nIt's only big enough to stick your head through. And it doesn't even open all the way.\nTrucy:\n...What? I was just saying it's possible.\nApollo:\nRight, right, no harm in that. (Except I'm pretty sure it is impossible.)\nJuly 7Backstage Hallway\nTrucy:\nEeeeeeeeeeeeek!\nApollo:\nWho's there!?\nTrucy:\nWe... didn't just imagine that, did we?\nApollo:\nHe was wearing a silk hat. ...Friend of yours?\nTrucy:\nHardly!\nApollo:\n(Whoever that was, he sure looked suspicious!)\nJuly 7In the Wings\nKlavier:\nWhat is it with today!? Problem after problem! Achtung!\n???:\nYou ain't kidding.\nTrucy:\nIt's the two leading members of the Gavinners, Apollo! Klavier on vocals, and Daryan on guitar! They're so cool!\nApollo:\nI have a hard time thinking of \"Klavier\" as anything but a prosecutor, honestly.\nTrucy:\nHuh? What are they arguing about?\nApollo:\nProbably the case, I'd bet.\nKlavier:\nMy hog won't start. My guitar case is busted... ...my guitar's been burnt to a crisp, and to top it all off, someone's dead! ...And then there was that performance just now. What was that all about!?\nDaryan:\nHey, man, don't blame me. You were the one who missed the cue.\nKlavier:\nMe? Miss a cue!? How could I conceivably get the most important part of that song wrong? How!? And what was all that tinny playing of yours?\nDaryan:\nWho you calling \"tinny\"!?\nTrucy:\n...Sounds like they're having a spat. One of those \"differences in musical direction\" bands are always splitting up over.\nApollo:\nThis is hardly the time...\nKlavier:\n...Hmm? What are you two doing here?\nApollo:\nAh, um, hiya. ......\nKlavier:\nWe were just discussing the investigation, if you don't mind.\nApollo:\nSorry. Wait... You were what?\nKlavier:\nListen... You need to confirm that with the Republic of Borginia, Detective Crescend.\nDaryan:\nRight. Anything else?\nApollo:\nWhat did he just call him? \"Detective\"...?\nDaryan:\nAh, greetings. Daryan Crescend... Criminal Affairs, Division 3.\nApollo:\nUh... H-Hello. (\"Criminal Affairs\"!?)\nTrucy:\n*sigh* Apollo... You really don't know anything about the Gavinners, do you?\nApollo:\n(Something tells me that's about to be remedied.)\nTalk\nThe case\nApollo:\nUm, about the crime...\nKlavier:\n...Which crime do you mean?\nApollo:\nThe murder, what else!?\nKlavier:\nOh, that. For me, today has been a hit parade of crimes, you see.\nTrucy:\nProsecutor Gavin was singing the blues earlier, wasn't he? ...Something about his hog, and his guitar case.\nKlavier:\n...Anyway. I'm afraid you know more about the killing of Mr. LeTouse than I do. ...For now, at least.\nApollo:\nHuh?\nKlavier:\nYou were the one who found the body, ja? While we were in the middle of a performance, no less.\nTrucy:\nAren't you going to examine the crime scene, Prosecutor Gavin?\nKlavier:\nI'll leave that to Fräulein Detective. Wouldn't want to step on her toes.\nTrucy:\nThey're not exactly best buddies are they. Ema and Prosecutor Gavin, I mean.\nApollo:\nWell, what to do next. We've already checked out the scene. (Prosecutor Gavin may be right. We might be the most informed, for once.)\nTrucy:\nMaybe Prosecutor Gavin can shed some light on things we've found!\nThe Gavinners\nTrucy:\nI don't believe you, Apollo! How can you come to this concert and not know about the Gavinners!?\nKlavier:\nIt's not surprising. Why, even our ancestors knew nothing of America's existence once.\nApollo:\nUm... I know America exists.\nTrucy:\nThe Gavinners aren't just an average rock band, Apollo. Each member is connected to the police somehow!\nApollo:\nThe Police?\nTrucy:\nThe real police! By day they pack heat, but by night they heat up the stage! By day those lips interrogate, by night they sing songs of unrequited passion!\nApollo:\n...Um, OK.\nTrucy:\nThey debuted seven years ago with \"13 Years Hard Time For Love\"... Then came \"Love With No Chance Of Parole\", and \"My Boyfriend Is The Prosecution's Witness\". The list of hits goes on and on!\nKlavier:\nThis here's my right-hand man. ...Daryan Crescend. I make the melodies, and he attacks them with his guitar. He's a bit of a rogue, really.\nDaryan:\nHeh. And this guy's a bit of a perfectionist. When a performance goes the least bit wrong he goes into this funk... Just like today.\nApollo:\n(I'd hope murder would be a bit more off-putting than a ruined concert...)\nKlavier:\nThe concert today? A disaster! I'll get to the bottom of this and then we'll see who missed a cue!\nTrucy:\nThe missed cue... They were arguing about that before...\nApollo:\n(Great, I love nothing more than questioning tormented artists.)\nThe missed cue (appears after \"The Gavinners\")\nTrucy:\nWhat's this missed cue you keep talking about?\nKlavier:\nAh ha, you heard it, didn't you? From the audience?\nTrucy:\nUm, actually, I didn't notice anything...\nDaryan:\nSee! No amateur is going to pick up on that!\nKlavier:\nCan you guarantee an entire audience of amateurs? No! Now take a listen to this!\nTrucy:\nWhat's that...?\nKlavier:\nA mixing board. We used it to record our concert tonight.\nApollo:\n(Aren't we supposed to be investigating a murder...?)\nTrucy:\nWell, we've come this far, might as well go all the way! I've always wanted to learn about the recording industry!\nKlavier:\nThis is but one of the devices used in recordings. We're a five-part band... This lets us record each member's performance separately. You use the sliders to adjust the volume for each part. Check it out!\nTrucy:\nWow, neat! So, could you, say, hear only the drum part?\nKlavier:\nOf course. That's how we'll find the criminal guilty of missing his cue tonight!\nApollo:\nI'm more concerned with the other criminal. The one who kills people.\nKlavier:\nYou want help on the case? Then help me with mine!\nApollo:\n(I guess rock 'n' roll comes before prosecuting.)\nKlavier:\nLet's begin! First, we bring up the part of the performance in question. You simply choose the section of the song you wish to hear on the upper-most bar. (Changed from [You simply choose the section of the song you wish to hear on the bottom-most bar.] in the original release) Like so. There it is. Now, listen.\nTrucy:\n...Was something wrong?\nKlavier:\nYou couldn't hear it? Listen again, closely...\nTrucy:\nAh... the timing's a little off, isn't it!?\nKlavier:\nYou see? There! Right at the most important part! And even an amateur can hear it!\nDaryan:\nAn amateur with a mixing board, maybe.\nKlavier:\nYou're missing the point! We'll never stamp out crime until we're perfect. Perfect!\nDaryan:\nHere he goes again...\nKlavier:\nRight. Herr Amateur, you will prove my point.\nApollo:\nHuh? Me!?\nKlavier:\nYou will find the missed cue! You will tell us which instrument, which part, is the guilty party!\nApollo:\nBut how...?\nKlavier:\nDid I not just explain it? Move the sliders with [left analog stick up / W] and [left analog stick down / S] to adjust the volume for each part. (Changed from [Use these sliders to adjust the volume for each part.] in the original release) Then you will find the part that hopelessly bungles the cue with [left analog stick left / A] and [left analog stick right / D]! (Changed from [Then you will find the part that hopelessly bungles the cue!] in the original release) You'll find it, with your untrained amateur ears!\nTrucy:\nNothing to do but try, Apollo!\nApollo:\n(I guess... I'll admit, this looks kind of fun.)\nKlavier:\nFirst, a quick review: use [left analog stick up / W] and [left analog stick down / S] to adjust a part's volume. (Changed from [First, a quick review: use the slider to adjust volumes.] in the original release) Jump to another section of the song with [L / LB / Q] and [R / RB / E]. (Changed from [Press the section of the song you wish to hear on the bottom bar.] in the original release)\nApollo:\n(And use [left analog stick left / A] and [left analog stick right / D] to switch parts, right? Got it.) (Changed from [Sliders and the bar, got it.] in the original release)\nKlavier:\nOnce you've found the guilty part, press [X / Y / R] to point it out! (Changed from [Once you've found the guilty part, press the corresponding number!] in the original release) Time to rock!\nPresent part 2\nApollo:\nLeads to:\n\"This part is off.\"\nPresent any other part\nApollo:\nApollo:\nThis part sounds a little off.\nKlavier:\nLet's see............... ...Herr Forehead.\nApollo:\nYes?\nKlavier:\nLet me guess... ...You got a D in high school chorus, didn't you?\nApollo:\n(How'd he know!?)\nKlavier:\nThis part is perfection. Absolute perfection. I'd bet all the royalties from my last platinum-selling album on it. The guilty part is elsewhere.\nApollo:\n(Yeah, yeah, I know you sold a bazillion records.)\nTrucy:\nFocus, Apollo! I'll cheer you on!\nApollo:\nActually, it's probably better if you stay quiet... (Let's give this another shot.)\nLeads back to track selection\nApollo:\nThis part is off.\nKlavier:\nWhich is that? Hmm... 2nd Guitar.\nDaryan:\nAh.\nKlavier:\nIt was you Daryan!\nDaryan:\n...... Ah well, looks like the cat's out of the bag.\nKlavier:\n\"Ah well\"? That's all you have to say!? That kind of attitude lets killers walk free, Daryan!\nTrucy:\nHere they go again.\nApollo:\nMaybe it wasn't such a good idea to ask about the concert. It's starting to feel like we're just wasting time.\nTrucy:\nIt's all experience under our belts! That can't be bad!\nMixing Board added to the Court Record.\nApollo:\n(I still can't get over the title for that song... ...\"Guilty Love\"...?)\nThe missed cue (subsequent times)\nApollo:\n(Best to avoid bringing up that topic again... I'm sure I can think of something else to ask about.)\nGavin's troubles (appears after presenting Key Ring)\nApollo:\nYou were saying something about your motorcycle not starting?\nTrucy:\nAnd something about your guitar case being busted?\nKlavier:\n...You're well informed.\nTrucy:\nYou mentioned it a few times.\nKlavier:\nAch. Ach! It all happened this morning. It's all this key ring's fault.\nApollo:\nThe key ring...\nKlavier:\nIt's got all my keys on it, ja? My bike key, my car key... and the key to my guitar case.\nTrucy:\nWait, so this key ring...\nKlavier:\n...It disappeared. I thought I'd put it in my jacket pocket...\nApollo:\n(Prosecutor Gavin's key ring... disappeared?)\nKlavier:\nI had to come to the concert by taxi. How embarrassing! And in order to get my guitar out, I had to break the lock.\nApollo:\nWait, this guitar wasn't the one that...\nKlavier:\nThe very one. Up in flames... ...And right on stage, too.\nTrucy:\nI actually thought that was part of the show.\nKlavier:\nCrazy. ...And to top it off, Mr. LeTouse's life was taken. Nobody told me 'bout days like these.\nApollo:\nStrange days, indeed.\nKlavier:\n...You think?\nTrucy:\n......\nApollo:\nWhat's wrong, Trucy?\nTrucy:\nWell, I was just trying to make sense of everything. First this heart-shaped key ring gets stolen. Then a very expensive guitar flares up on stage. Then Mr. LeTouse dies...\nKlavier:\nYes, and...?\nTrucy:\nCould it all really be just a coincidence?\nKlavier:\nCoincidence...? Meaning...? Daryan, can you make any sense of all this?\nDaryan:\n...Hey, don't look at me.\nTrucy:\nWhat do you think, Apollo?\nApollo:\nHuh?\nTrucy:\nI mean, either Mr. Gavin's having a really bad day... ...or all this was planned.\nKlavier:\n...... You... aren't thinking what I think you're thinking... ...are you, Fräulein?\nTrucy:\nI am!\nDaryan:\nWhat? What!? Hey, don't leave me in the dark with Spike, here.\nApollo:\n(...The name's Apollo, but yeah, I agree... Don't leave us in the dark! What are you talking about?)\nTrucy:\nHaven't you noticed a connection, Apollo? ...A curious connection between all of Mr. Gavin's troubles today?\nApollo:\nUm, well...\nI have noticed\nApollo:\nYou know, something was bugging me, too! That key ring, and the guitar, and the body...\nTrucy:\nSlow down there, Polly. You look a wee bit dizzy.\nDaryan:\nHe's bluffing. He hasn't figured it out. Fess up, if you're a man. You're as clueless as I am!\nApollo:\nHuh?\nKlavier:\nNo, no, give Herr Forehead a chance. Let's see your evidence of the connection, shall we?\nApollo:\nE-Evidence!? (Ack! I'd better think of something pronto!)\nTrucy:\nC'mon c'mon c'mon! Let's see it! What's the connection between all of Mr. Gavin's troubles?\nPresent Lyrics Sheet\nApollo:\nLeads to:\n\"It's this, isn't it?\"\nPresent anything else\nApollo:\nApollo:\nThe connection... is this! Right?\nTrucy:\nUm, I would say you were close, but really, you're kinda far. Remote, even.\nApollo:\n(Oops. Try not to anger the Trucy, Apollo. No sudden motions... Just find that evidence slowly.)\nLeads back to:\n\"C'mon c'mon c'mon! Let's see it!\"\nApollo:\nIt's this, isn't it?\nLeads to:\n\"A lyrics sheet? ...\"The Guitar's Serenade\"...? What's that got to do with anything?\"\nI haven't noticed\nTrucy:\nYou haven't!?\nApollo:\n...I just don't see the connection. Sorry.\nTrucy:\nWell don't just give up! Give it a little more thought!\nApollo:\nWait... You don't mean this, do you?\nLeads to:\n\"A lyrics sheet? ...\"The Guitar's Serenade\"...? What's that got to do with anything?\"\nDaryan:\nA lyrics sheet? ...\"The Guitar's Serenade\"...? What's that got to do with anything?\nKlavier:\nIt has everything to do with everything. Though I wouldn't have believed it if the Fräulein hadn't pointed it out.\nDaryan:\nWhat are you talking about, man? Enough with the riddles!\nKlavier:\nMaybe it is a coincidence, or perhaps it means something. Don't you think, Fräulein?\nTrucy:\nI do. Everything that's happened to Mr. Gavin today... ...is predicted in the lyrics to this song!\nDaryan:\nWh-Whaaat!? No way!\nThe song's prediction (appears after \"Gavin's troubles\")\nTrucy:\nLook, just think about everything that's happened to Mr. Gavin. Let's list them in the order that they occurred... ...while reading this lyrics sheet!\nApollo:\nFirst, the key ring was stolen.\nTrucy:\nAnd not just any key ring! A heart-shaped key ring!\nApollo:\nThat's right here! \"When you stole away the keys my heart held on to so tight.\" This is a \"heart\" holding \"keys\"!\nTrucy:\nAnd next, his guitar burst into flame.\nApollo:\n\"Burning on in my heart. Fire. Burn my love away...\"\nTrucy:\nAnd then Mr. LeTouse was killed...\nApollo:\n\"Like a bullet of love. Fire. Take my life away...\" But... But that's crazy!\nTrucy:\nYeah, no kidding!\nDaryan:\nSo everything that happened today, here... ...This song predicted it all?\nKlavier:\nOr perhaps it was the other way around...\nApollo:\nHuh?\nKlavier:\nThe criminal could have based their crime on the lyrics. (Changed from [The criminal could have based his crime on the lyrics.] in the original release)\nApollo:\nBut who would go through all that trouble...?\nKlavier:\nSomeone who moves in mysterious ways, no doubt. I believe you've stumbled upon something quite vital... and quite annoying, Fräulein.\nTrucy:\nEh heh.\nApollo:\n(She looks pleased...)\nPresent\nKey Ring\nApollo:\nUm, I was wondering if you knew anything about this?\nKlavier:\nTh-That...!\nApollo:\nDoes it look familiar?\nKlavier:\nFamiliar! It's mine! That's my key ring! I've been looking all over for it!\nTrucy:\nWhaaaaaat!? This is yours, Mr. Gavin!?\nApollo:\n(I knew it...)\nTrucy:\nApollo! How can you make that \"I knew it\" face!? This is the key ring that was...\nApollo:\nYeah, I know.\nKlavier:\nThanks, anyway. So, where did you find it?\nApollo:\nErm, actually, the victim was holding it. Like he was trying to keep it from the killer. Even if it meant his life.\nKlavier:\n...... Wh-Wha... Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? The victim... you mean, Mr. LeTouse had my keys?\nApollo:\nIndeed.\nKlavier:\nHrmm... When will my trials be over?\nTrucy:\nSpeaking of trials, I've never heard Mr. Gavin whine in court like he has been today.\nApollo:\nEma was right about the fop, I'll give her that.\nTrucy:\nApollo! Mr. Gavin, maybe we can help. Tell us about your troubles today.\nKlavier:\nI really don't think that's...\nTrucy:\nTell us... ...and we'll keep mum about the key ring for now.\nKlavier:\nAre... you blackmailing me, Fräulein?\nKey Ring (subsequent times)\nKlavier:\nAnyway... Thanks for finding this. If you'd found it under different circumstances, I'd be even happier.\nTrucy:\nI wonder why Mr. LeTouse was holding it?\nApollo:\nMaybe he was trying to tell us something? Maybe that Prosecutor Gavin is the killer?\nKlavier:\nHerr Forehead, save your wild accusations for the court. I do so enjoy the penalties.\nAnything else\nKlavier:\nSorry, but I'm not in the mood to talk about that right now. Even I can only take so much in one day.\nApollo:\n(Funny, I always thought of Prosecutor Gavin as one of those cool, stoic types. The sort that never complains. How wrong I was!)\nAfter clearing \"The missed cue\" and \"The song's prediction\" Talk options:\nDaryan:\nThe lyrics predicting the crime... Klavier?\nKlavier:\nSeems a bit more than just a coincidence to me.\nDaryan:\nI have to agree. The key ring, the guitar, and the murder...\nApollo:\nThe key ring might have been dropped by accident.\nKlavier:\nYet the victim was holding it. Hard to think that it was unconnected.\nApollo:\nThat's true. (Prosecutor Gavin's as calm and collected as ever...)\nTrucy:\nSo the criminal matched their actions to the lyrics?\nDaryan:\nThat sounds likely.\nApollo:\nWhy would anyone do that?\nDaryan:\n...While we think about that, I'm going to get cracking on the biggest crime here. I'm going to talk to the Borginian Embassy about this Mr. LeTouse.\nKlavier:\nAh, right. Thanks, Daryan.\nDaryan:\nI'll leave the pondering of mysteries to you. I'm outta here.\nKlavier:\nA foreign national, Mr. LeTouse was killed... It seems like that would have to be the \"point\" of all this. But they did more than that. They left us with not only a murder, but a mystery!\nTrucy:\nMr. Gavin sure is irritable today.\nApollo:\nMaybe this is the real Prosecutor Gavin we don't get to see in the courtroom.\nKlavier:\n...I've had enough, frankly. If you find any more mysteries, do me a favor and keep them to yourselves, ja?\nApollo:\nJa... (I guess this is all we're going to get from Prosecutor Gavin. That leaves Lamiroir to question.) Prosecutor Gavin... do you know where Lamiroir is now?\nKlavier:\nAh, I had her go to my dressing room. With that pianist, Machi Tobaye, of course. She seemed rather shocked by Mr. LeTouse's sudden passing.\nApollo:\n(The Gavinners's dressing room. Got it!)\nTalk\nThe Gavinners\nTrucy:\nI don't believe you, Apollo! How can you come to this concert and not know about the Gavinners!?\nKlavier:\nIt's not surprising. Why, even our ancestors knew nothing of America's existence once.\nApollo:\nUm... I know America exists.\nTrucy:\nThe Gavinners aren't just an average rock band, Apollo. Each member is connected to the police somehow!\nApollo:\nThe Police?\nTrucy:\nThe real police! By day they pack heat, but by night they heat up the stage! By day those lips interrogate, by night they sing songs of unrequited passion!\nApollo:\n...Um, OK.\nThe song's prediction\nTrucy:\nLook, just think about everything that's happened to Mr. Gavin. Let's list them in the order that they occurred... ...while reading this lyrics sheet!\nApollo:\nFirst, the key ring was stolen.\nTrucy:\nAnd not just any key ring! A heart-shaped key ring!\nApollo:\n\"When you stole away the keys my heart held on to so tight.\" This is a \"heart\" holding \"keys\"!\nTrucy:\nAnd next, his guitar burst into flame.\nApollo:\n\"Burning on in my heart. Fire. Burn my love away...\"\nTrucy:\nAnd then Mr. LeTouse was killed...\nApollo:\n\"Like a bullet of love. Fire. Take my life away...\"\nApollo:\nSo this song prerdicted everything that was going to happen!?\nKlavier:\nOr perhaps it was the other way around...\nApollo:\nHuh?\nKlavier:\nThe criminal could have based their crime on the lyrics. (Changed from [The criminal could have based his crime on the lyrics.] in the original release)\nKlavier:\nSomeone who moves in mysterious ways, no doubt. I believe you've stumbled upon something quite vital... and quite annoying, Fräulein.\nTrucy:\nEh heh.\nApollo:\n(She looks pleased...)\nJuly 7Backstage Hallway\nTrucy:\nEeeeeeeeeeeeek!\nApollo:\nWho's there!? ...There he goes again. Who is that guy!?\nTrucy:\n......\nApollo:\nHuh? Trucy?\nTrucy:\nYou know, he did look sort of familiar...\nApollo:\n...So he is a friend of yours!\nTrucy:\nNo, that's not it. ...Sorry, I don't remember.\nApollo:\n(Curiouser and curiouser...)\nExamine evidence\nKey Ring\nGuitar-shaped key\nApollo:\nThere are three keys on this heart-shaped key ring. And this guitar-shaped key was the key to a guitar case.\nTrucy:\nWasn't he saying he had to break his case because he couldn't get it unlocked? I could open a lock like that in 10 seconds, easy! He should have given me a call.\nApollo:\n...So he could slap handcuffs on you after you opened it?\nTrucy:\nHandcuffs? 20 seconds, tops!\nApollo:\n(I'm glad she's on my side.)\nJuly 7Gavinners's Dressing Room\nTrucy:\nAh... Lamiroir!\nLamiroir:\nWhat... What has happened? I heard that Mr. LeTouse has died!\nApollo:\nL-Lamiroir! You speak? I mean, you speak English?\nLamiroir:\nAh... Yes. I was invited here from the Republic of Borginia... But I am not Borginian by birth.\nTrucy:\nBut wasn't Mr. LeTouse your interpreter...?\nLamiroir:\nAh that. Yes, well... It was Mr. LeTouse's idea. He thought it would add to the mystery, you see.\nApollo:\nThen, your pianist is also...?\nMachi:\n....................\nLamiroir:\nNo, Machi Tobaye is Borginian. He does not speak English. Now, please tell me! What has happened to Mr. LeTouse? Why did he...\nTrucy:\nActually, Mr. LeTouse was...\nApollo:\nTrucy!\nTrucy:\nHuh?\nApollo:\nRemember what Prosecutor Gavin said? \"Not a word\"!\nTrucy:\nB-But Mr. LeTouse is Lamiroir's manager! That's not fair to her! I mean, isn't she a related party?\nApollo:\n(Precisely who Prosecutor Gavin doesn't want to alert, I'd suspect.)\nLamiroir:\nAll we have been told is to wait here in this room. It is very unsettling.\nApollo:\nI'm sorry, we're trying to figure it out ourselves. Do... you think I could ask you some questions?\nLamiroir:\nOf course. I am always willing to help.\nApollo:\n(She's as calm as she looked on stage... I can't put my finger on why, but I like this Lamiroir.)\nMachi:\n[Foreign text]....\nLamiroir:\nWhat is it, Machi?\nMachi:\n[Foreign text]....\nLamiroir:\nWhat... but you'd be alone!\nMachi:\n[Foreign text]....\nApollo:\nUm, what seems to be the problem?\nLamiroir:\nMachi... he is not good around strangers. He wishes to go out for a breath of fresh air. Would that be alright?\nApollo:\nUh, sure, of course.\nMachi:\n....................\nLamiroir:\nVery well. What is it you wished to ask me about?\nExamine\nPostcards (if not already examined)\nTrucy:\nLook! It's a postcard of Lamiroir!\nApollo:\nWhat are these letters at the bottom? I've never seen these before.\nTrucy:\nIt must be her native tongue, Borginian! (Changed from [It must be her native tongue, Borginese!] in the original release)\nLamiroir:\n\"A landscape painter in sound\"... This is how it would translate, roughly. Please, take one.\nApollo:\n(\"A landscape painter in sound\"...? That's a nice image...)\nPostcard added to the Court Record.\nPostcards (subsequent times)\nLamiroir:\nYou see the words written upon the postcard? They say \"a landscape painter in sound\".\nApollo:\n(\"A landscape painter in sound\"...? That's a nice image...)\nTalk\nLamiroir\nApollo:\nThe Republic of Borginia... that's in Northern Europe, right?\nTrucy:\nI've never even heard of it...\nLamiroir:\nI started out singing in a restaurant... Then a producer called me. Before I knew it... here I am.\nTrucy:\nYou don't say! You know, my daddy plays piano in a restaurant!\nApollo:\nProducers tend to look for talent, Trucy. ...Lamiroir, you're not from Borginia originally? Were you born here?\nLamiroir:\nWell...\nApollo:\nOh, is that supposed to be a secret?\nTrucy:\nImage is everything when you're a star! I know a bit about that, of course...\nLamiroir:\nAh, yes, it is something like this. A contract, you might say. I'm also not to speak anything but Borginian in public. (Changed from [I'm also not to speak anything but Borginese in public.] in the original release)\nApollo:\nImage is important, I guess.\nTrucy:\nShe's not all image, though! Her songs are lovely! A real \"landscape painter in sound\"!\nApollo:\nA painter in what?\nTrucy:\nShe travels the world, turning the sights she sees into music! That's the secret to your music's beauty, right?\nLamiroir:\nYou're very perceptive.\nTrucy:\nOh, I use your songs all the time in my stage act. ...I don't have to pay royalties for that, do I?\nApollo:\nStop while you're ahead, Trucy.\nLamiroir:\nThis \"landscape painter in sound\", too, is an image. Yet without it, my songs would not be so widely heard.\nTrucy:\nThey even call you the \"Siren of the Ballad\", right?\nLamiroir:\nYes. In Borginian, \"Lamiroir\" means \"the Siren\". (Changed from [Yes. In Borginese, \"Lamiroir\" means \"the Siren\".] in the original release) I fear that, perhaps, already I am not the siren I once was.\nMachi\nTrucy:\nYour pianist... Machi, was it? He's cute! Like a porcelain doll...\nApollo:\nHe's very \"European\".\nLamiroir:\nI met him while singing in restaurants in Borginia. He is an orphan... yet his playing is exquisite. Soon he came to live with me.\nTrucy:\nIt's like a fairy tale, almost...\nApollo:\nI noticed he hardly leaves your side.\nLamiroir:\nYes, well, he is blind. At first, I hesitated at dragging him across the world.\nApollo:\nHe doesn't speak English, either, does he?\nLamiroir:\nHe had never left Borginia before we met. I made his presence part of my contract. Machi and I together are \"Lamiroir\". Together, always.\nMr. LeTouse\nLamiroir:\nMr. LeTouse... was my new manager.\nApollo:\nNew?\nLamiroir:\nYes, from three months ago. Around when I received Mr. Gavin's invitation to come. I met Mr. LeTouse at my office. He was to be my manager and bodyguard... And, as it turned out, my interpreter.\nApollo:\nInterpreter... even though you speak English.\nLamiroir:\nYes... but we were to visit more places than just here. We had a concert in Japan scheduled after this one. Though I fear that may have to be canceled now...\nTrucy:\nWas Mr. LeTouse from the Republic of Borginia, too?\nLamiroir:\nWell... he was only with me for three months. I'm afraid there is much I do not know about him. And now, I shall never know. No one will even tell me why he has died.\nApollo:\nI-I'm sorry... Prosecutor Gavin said we weren't to talk to anyone...\nLamiroir:\nMr. LeTouse... was a talented man. The \"Siren of the Ballad\"... That phrase was his idea, you know. I am happy for him that it has become so well known.\nAfter clearing \"Lamiroir\" and \"Mr. LeTouse\" Talk options:\nApollo:\nThe \"siren\"... That's what he meant!\nTrucy:\nHuh? Apollo?\nApollo:\nYou are \"the Siren\", right Lamiroir?\nLamiroir:\nThat is the meaning of my name in Borginian, yes. (Changed from [That is the meaning of my name in Borginese, yes.] in the original release) It was the name my producer gave me. But why do you ask?\nApollo:\n...It's very important. I had to know for sure if the \"Siren\" was you.\nLamiroir:\nWhat do you mean, important?\nApollo:\n...I'll tell you. You deserve to know.\nTalk\nThe \"Siren\"\nApollo:\n\"Siren\"... It turns out that's a very important word in this case.\nTrucy:\nH-How?\nApollo:\nWhen we found Mr. LeTouse... ...he was still alive.\nLamiroir:\nWhat...?\nApollo:\nI heard him say something... ...his last words.\nApollo:\nMr. LeTouse! Can you hear me!?\nLeTouse:\nAsk... wi...witness...\nApollo:\nHang in there, Mr. LeTouse! Tell me, who was the witness?\nLeTouse:\nThe wi...witness...is ...si...si...ren...\nTrucy:\nHe said \"siren\"... Really?\nApollo:\nI was the only one there to hear it... ...but I'm sure that's what he said!\nLamiroir:\nMr. LeTouse said that!? \"Ask the witness\"...?\nApollo:\nAnd you're the Siren, Lamiroir.\nLamiroir:\n......\nApollo:\nDid you see what happened?\nLamiroir:\n......\nApollo:\nLamiroir...?\nLamiroir:\nMight I ask, are you with the police?\nApollo:\nEh! Uh, well, no. I'm a defense attorney.\nLamiroir:\nAn attorney? Yet there have been no arrests, yes?\nApollo:\n...Is that a problem?\nLamiroir:\nDoes an attorney not work for a \"client\"? If you have no client, you should leave the investigation to the police, I think.\nTrucy:\nBut Lamiroir, we...\nLamiroir:\nI am sorry, but I cannot answer your questions. I'm afraid you lack the authority to ask them.\nApollo:\nAck... (Why...? If she witnessed the crime, why won't she tell us...?)\nLamiroir:\nI believe we are through here.\nApollo:\n...I believe so.\nThe \"Siren\" (subsequent times)\nApollo:\n\"Siren\"... It turns out that's a very important word in this case.\nTrucy:\nH-How?\nApollo:\nWhen we found Mr. LeTouse... ...he was still alive.\nLamiroir:\nWhat...?\nApollo:\nI heard him say something... ...his last words.\nApollo:\nMr. LeTouse! Can you hear me!?\nLeTouse:\nAsk... wi...witness...\nApollo:\nHang in there, Mr. LeTouse! Tell me, who was the witness?\nLeTouse:\nThe wi...witness...is ...si...si...ren...\nTrucy:\nHe said \"siren\"... Really?\nApollo:\nI was the only one there to hear it... ...but I'm sure that's what he said!\nLamiroir:\nMr. LeTouse said that!? \"Ask the witness\"...?\nApollo:\nAnd you're the Siren, Lamiroir.\nLamiroir:\n......\nApollo:\nDid you see what happened?\nLamiroir:\n......\nPresent\nBrooch\nApollo:\nThat reminds me... Does this brooch look familiar to you?\nLamiroir:\nMy brooch... yes! Well... It may be mine.\nApollo:\nYours, Lamiroir...?\nLamiroir:\nI was wearing a brooch earlier, you see. I must have lost it.\nTrucy:\nWell that explains the brooch we found. It was Lamiroir's!\nLamiroir:\nThank you. I was wondering where I'd dropped it.\nApollo:\n(So this brooch belongs to her... That begs the question...)\nTrucy:\nIs something wrong, Apollo?\nApollo:\n(...What was this brooch doing at the crime scene?)\nBrooch (subsequent times)\nLamiroir:\nI believe that brooch is mine, yes. ... I was wondering where I had dropped it.\nApollo:\n(So it's Lamiroir's brooch, which begs the question... ...what was it doing at the crime scene?)\nAnything else\nApollo:\nWould you mind taking a look at this, Lamiroir?\nLamiroir:\n...... I'm sorry, I'm not sure what to say. I wish I could help you.\nApollo:\nAh, don't worry about it. (Certainly one of the most pleasant refusals I've had.)\nAfter examining postcards, clearing \"The \"Siren\"\" Talk option, and presenting Brooch in Gavinners's Dressing Room:\nJuly 8, 12:22 AMBackstage Hallway\nApollo:\nWhoa! Who's there now!?\nEma:\nAh, it's you. ...Where were you!?\nApollo:\nAck! Ema! ...Is something wrong? (She's looks grumpier than usual.)\nEma:\nYou bet something's wrong! The impossible's happened! Arrgh! It's all your fault, you know!\nApollo:\n(Oops. Maybe this is about us leaving the crime scene.)\nTrucy:\nWhat do you mean by \"impossible\"?\nEma:\nWell it's gone! Utterly gone!\nTrucy:\n...What's gone?\nEma:\nThe body, stupid! What else?\nTrucy:\nEh...\nEma:\nMr. LeTouse's body has disappeared!\nTrucy:\nWhaaaaaaaaaat!?\nJuly 8Lamiroir's Dressing Room\nApollo:\nAh... Prosecutor Gavin.\nKlavier:\nFrom your vacant stare, I gather you've heard the news.\nApollo:\nI heard Mr. LeTouse's body has gone missing...\nKlavier:\nLook for yourself. Quite the pickle. Quite. The. Pickle.\nEma:\nHow can you just stand there!? We have to start the investi...\nKlavier:\nThere's no need for alarm, Fräulein Detective.\nEma:\n...!\nKlavier:\nAll entrances and exits have been sealed. The body will not leave the building. So, I suggest we go find ourselves a cadaver. There will be plenty of time to ponder the \"whys\" later.\nTrucy:\nWell, you seem pretty sure of yourself, Mr. Gavin.\nKlavier:\nOh, we'll find him. I'm rather enjoying this.\nApollo:\n(How could Mr. LeTouse's body just \"disappear\"?)\nTrucy:\nWell, you heard the man. Let's get searching!\nDaryan:\n...Hey, I don't know if this's exactly the right time, but...\nKlavier:\nYes, Daryan?\nDaryan:\nSee, Geeter's gone missing. It was in the dressing room.\nTrucy:\nGeeter? Who's Geeter!?\nDaryan:\nThat's what I call my guitar! You like, man?\nKlavier:\nYour guitar... was stolen?\nEma:\nThis hasn't been a good day for guitars or geeters.\nKlavier:\nOK. Body first, then guitar. And if someone finds that guitar, please bring it to our dressing room.\nDaryan:\nGeeter's like a missing person, not lost 'n' found, man.\nExamine\nBloodstains on floor\nApollo:\nThere should be a body here. But there's not. How could this have happened? And why?\nTalk\nDisappearing act\nEma:\nWell, this sure is a... what did he call it? A sausage? No wait, it was a pickle. And it's your pickle! I told you to stay in the room!\nApollo:\n...Sorry. (Not much else I can say.)\nEma:\n...It's alright. Top priority now is finding that body. ...You can make it up to me later. Ten bags or so of chocolate Snackoos should do the trick nicely.\nApollo:\n(You should watch your sugar intake, Ema.)\nPresent\nAnything\nApollo:\nEma, could you take a look at this?\nEma:\nJust hold it right there. This is not time to be waving a bag of Snackoos in my face!\nApollo:\nUm, it's not a bag of Snackoos.\nEma:\nLook. What's important is that Mr. LeTouse's body is missing! And we've got to find it!\nApollo:\n(She would be more convincing if she wasn't standing around eating her precious Snackoos.)\nJuly 8, 12:57 AMIn the Wings\nTrucy:\nHmm. Does something seem different to you, Apollo?\nApollo:\nSomething is definitely different here.\nTrucy:\nLet's check it out!\nExamine\nStage tower\nLeads to:\n\"That stage there must have been lowered before.\"\nAnywhere else\nTrucy:\nI'm not sure that's all that important right now. Let's check out that thing in the middle of the stage!\nTrucy:\nThat stage there must have been lowered before.\nApollo:\nThat's the tower that Lamiroir and Prosecutor Gavin were singing on.\nTrucy:\nSomeone must have raised it. Hmm. I don't see a way to control it from here. Apollo, what about that ladder there against the wall? We could use that to take a look up top...\nApollo:\n...... Maybe we should get Ema.\nTrucy:\nWhat are you talking about? We have to see this sort of thing for ourselves!\nApollo:\n(I'm... not so good with heights.)\nTrucy:\nStop whining and start climbing!\nApollo:\nUrk...\nApollo:\n(It didn't look that high from below, really. But when we got to the top, I felt every one of those fifteen feet down. (Changed from [But when we got to the top, I felt every one of those 20 feet down.] in the original release) Of course, I wasn't thinking about the height any more. Not after what we found up there.)\nTrucy:\nEeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!\nApollo:\n(We found two things we were looking for, and one thing we never expected to find.) ...The body, guitar in hand, and the pianist, Machi Tobaye.\nJuly 8, 10:09 AMWright Anything Agency\nApollo:\nWow, that concert last night sure went south in a hurry!\nTrucy:\nNo kidding. Why did they arrest Machi!? Why!?\nApollo:\nDon't look at me like it's my fault! (Machi Tobaye, the blind pianist... ...arrested on suspicion of murdering Romein LeTouse.)\nTrucy:\nI can't believe such a cute little boy could do something so horrible!\nApollo:\nI guess they had proof of some kind.\nTrucy:\nWhat proof could possibly prove that!?\nKlavier:\nMornin'.\nApollo:\nP-Prosecutor Gavin?\nKlavier:\nWhat a night, eh? I apologize for being so upset...\nTrucy:\nMr. Gavin, do you know what's going on? Why did they arrest Machi!? Why!?\nApollo:\nDon't look at him like it's his fault either.\nKlavier:\nIt was tough for me, too. We performed together that night, after all. Yet...\nTrucy:\nYet?\nKlavier:\nThe powers that be say that, given the circumstances, it could only have been him.\nApollo:\nWhat do you mean by the \"circumstances\"?\nKlavier:\nLamiroir was invited from Borginia as an ambassador of goodwill. It is vital that this case be wrapped up swiftly. That's all the powers that be want, really.\nApollo:\nWell those are circumstances, alright. But what makes Machi the only possible suspect?\nKlavier:\nHerr Forehead... You seem to have forgotten that you're talking to the prosecution... the enemy.\nApollo:\nAh. Right. (I think I like this side of Prosecutor Gavin better, actually.)\nKlavier:\nI'm not at liberty to discuss the particulars of the case. ...Especially not to the defense attorney.\nApollo:\nWhat... did you just say? Me? The defense attorney?\nKlavier:\nThat's what I came to tell you. He's down at the detention center... He wants to request your services.\nApollo:\nHe...? You mean Machi? Machi wants me...?\nTrucy:\nThis is what we've been waiting for, Apollo! Let's get going!\nApollo:\nUh... Right...!\nKlavier:\nGood luck. I'm off to question Lamiroir.\nApollo:\nR-Right. Later! (I hope I'm up to this...)\nJuly 8Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nTrucy:\nWell, I just don't get it. I refuse to believe a cute little kid like that could do something so terrible.\nApollo:\n...You said that already.\nMachi:\n...........................\nTrucy:\nMachi! Everything's going to be OK! We're here for you!\nApollo:\nUm, h-hi. Maybe you can tell me about last night...\nMachi:\n[Foreign text]....\nTrucy:\nHuh?\nMachi:\n[Foreign text].... [Foreign text]!\nApollo:\n(That was when I realized how tough it must be... A little kid like this... ...in a country so far from everything he's ever known.)\nTrucy:\nUm, maybe Lamiroir can help?\nApollo:\nBut didn't Prosecutor Gavin say she was with him?\nKlavier:\nGood luck. I'm off to question Lamiroir.\nTrucy:\nWell, what are we going to do?\nApollo:\nThat's, um, a good question. (I can't think of anything we can do but go with this. ...And hope for the best at the trial tomorrow.)\nMachi:\n[Foreign text].... [Foreign text]....\nTo be continued.\nNothing to examine during investigation\nApollo:\nNo clues here.\nTurnabout Serenade\nTranscript\nPart 1\nPart 2\nPart 3\nPart 4\nJuly 9, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3\nJudge:\nCourt is now in session for... how do I say that?\nKlavier:\n\"Machi Tobaye\", Your Honor. The Pixie of the Arpeggio.\nJudge:\nRight, his trial. Court is in session!\nApollo:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.\nKlavier:\nThe prosecution is A-OK, Herr Judge.\nJudge:\nHmm... Very well, Prosecutor Gavin.\nKlavier:\nAh, my opening statement, ja?\nJudge:\nNo, no, actually... There was something else I wanted to ask you about.\nKlavier:\n...? Yes?\nJudge:\nSay you're going to visit someone in the hospital with an incurable disease... What do you say to them?\nKlavier:\nEh?\nJudge:\nI mean, you wouldn't say \"get well soon\", right? You'd only be kicking them when they're down...\nApollo:\nUm, what are you talking about?\nJudge:\nAhem, actually I'm going to visit someone who is terminally ill. ...Right after this trial. The Chief Justice's son.\nApollo:\nThe Chief Justice...?\nJudge:\nHis son is afflicted with a most terrible disease... He doesn't have long, it seems.\nApollo:\nAh...\nJudge:\nSo I thought I'd go pay him a visit. I thought saying something moving might be the order of the day.\nTrucy:\nWhy don't grown-ups ever just say what's on their mind instead of pretending?\nApollo:\n(She's looking at me with something like... disgust.) ...Hey! What are you looking at me like that for!?\nJudge:\nIn any case... I'm a bit busy today, so let's wrap this up quickly. Prosecutor Gavin, your opening statement, briefly!\nKlavier:\nYou're in luck, Herr Judge... I believe you'll be going on your hospital visit sooner than you think.\nApollo:\n...!\nKlavier:\nFirst, to review the victim in this case. Romein LeTouse, age 35. The global manager for diva songstress, Lamiroir. The cause of death: blood loss due to being shot by a large caliber revolver. This report has all the details.\nJudge:\nThe court accepts this into evidence.\nLeTouse's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.\nJudge:\n45-caliber... That's quite large, isn't it? A direct hit from that could knock a man off his feet.\nKlavier:\nHowever, the bullet struck him in his shoulder. The damage to his body was slight... death was not immediate. Sadly, his blood loss was such that he could not be saved.\nJudge:\nHmm... I suppose the victim's condition could have been much worse, considering.\nCrime Photo added to the Court Record.\nKlavier:\n...Two shots were fired. One shot missed, the other penetrated and passed through the victim's shoulder. Both bullets were found in the wall at the scene. Observe the diagram... ...This is where the bullets hit.\nJudge:\nI see... The court accepts this evidence.\nDiagram added to the Court Record.\nJudge:\nIf we're talking about a 45-caliber revolver... ...we must assume that the killer was adept at the weapon's use.\nTrucy:\nReally?\nApollo:\nYeah, apparently, weapons that size have a powerful kickback. If, say, the judge tried to fire one, it'd break every bone in his body.\nJudge:\nThe defense will take more care in choosing examples!\nKlavier:\n...As I was saying, the victim was shot backstage, in a dressing room. This dressing room has only one entrance: this door.\nJudge:\nThat does seem to be the case, yes.\nKlavier:\nHowever, there were witnesses who heard the gunshots.\nTrucy:\nHe's talking about you and Ema, huh.\nKlavier:\nYet when the witnesses entered the room... ...it was empty, save for the victim's body, of course.\nJudge:\nB-But that's... That's impossible!\nKlavier:\nExactly. This murder was impossible. ...For all but one person.\nJudge:\nOne person?\nKlavier:\nThat is, of course... ...the defendant, Machi Tobaye.\nJudge:\nOnly this defendant could have committed the crime? But how?\nKlavier:\nIt's quite simple. The circumstances of the crime scene make it clear.\nJudge:\nVery well, I assume you have testimony to back up this claim. Please show the witness to the stand! (Changed from [Let the witness please take the stand!] in the original release)\nKlavier:\nYour name and profession, please.\nEma:\nEma Skye, I'm a detective for the police department. I was on security detail at the concert forum that night.\nApollo:\n(Ema seems... tired, somehow.)\nJudge:\nHmm... Security at the concert, you say?\nEma:\nSome security I was. Couldn't even stop a murder... ......\nJudge:\nNow, don't blame yourself! Things like this happen! I've made even bigger mistakes in my career, you know!\nApollo:\n(I'm sure that makes her feel much better.)\nTrucy:\nI want to hear about these bigger mistakes!\nKlavier:\nIn any case... Because you were on security detail, the crime was quickly discovered. And, we were able to identify the killer.\nEma:\n......\nKlavier:\nYou may give the court your testimony, if you would. Describe the circumstances of that day, and your discovery of the crime, please.\nEma:\n...Alright.\nWitness Testimony\n-- Murderous Circumstances --\nEma:\nThe night of the murder, I was on security backstage, at Prosecutor Gavin's request.\nOnly people involved with the concert in some way were allowed backstage.\nAt the beginning of the third set... I heard shots.\nI went into the room, filled with blaring rock music, and found the body.\nI examined the scene and determined that only the defendant could have done it.\nJudge:\nHmm... It was lucky that a detective was the first on the scene.\nTrucy:\nBut that door was the only way out of the room, right?\nApollo:\nYeah, pretty much.\nTrucy:\nThen I don't get it. How can they say that Machi did it?\nApollo:\nLooks like we need a bit more information.\nJudge:\nVery well, the defense may begin the cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- Murderous Circumstances --\nEma:\nThe night of the murder, I was on security backstage, at Prosecutor Gavin's request.\nPress\nApollo:\nApollo:\nThe night of the murder was the night of the concert, yes?\nEma:\nThat's right.\nApollo:\nWhat was a detective doing on security detail, might I ask? ...If it was only a concert?\nEma:\nMy thoughts exactly. But, orders are orders. Even when they come from rock gods.\nApollo:\nProsecutor Gavin...?\nKlavier:\nYes, allow me to explain. I smelled something that day, you might say. The stench... of conspiracy. That day, at the concert hall.\nApollo:\nConspiracy...?\nKlavier:\nWell, isn't it obvious!? My keys! That whole morning, no, the whole day was ruined! And it's all because someone stole my keys! I couldn't ride my hog to the show, I couldn't open my guitar case...\nTrucy:\nThere he goes again.\nApollo:\nIsn't it possible he simply misplaced them?\nKlavier:\nMisplaced them!? Misplaced items don't just wander into a murder victim's hand on their own!\nJudge:\nWhat's this!? Prosecutor Gavin, if your keys were in the victim's hand... That makes you a prime suspect!\nKlavier:\n...\"Love, slow-acting and new. Atroquinine... is waiting for you...\"\nTrucy:\nHe's singing something.\nApollo:\nDoes everything with this guy have to be so over-the-top?\nKlavier:\n...The killing happened in the middle of my concert. I was... like a sailor, adrift on a sea of sound. Anyway, I didn't want anything else stolen. So I put the detective with the most time on their hands on the task.\nJudge:\nI see. I can accept that.\nEma:\nWell I can't! What do you mean \"time on their hands\"!?\nJudge:\nPlease, the testimony.\nEma:\nOnly people involved with the concert in some way were allowed backstage.\nPress\nApollo:\nApollo:\n...We were let in, though.\nEma:\nI didn't know about that! I certainly didn't invite you.\nKlavier:\nI gave the Fräulein special permission to be there. ...I wanted to see her again.\nTrucy:\nOh boy! Did you hear that? We're officially involved now!\nApollo:\nGee, great.\nEma:\nSome other hangers-on tried to get backstage, but I drove them off.\nApollo:\n(So no other \"outsiders\" were there, then.)\nEma:\nAnd then...\nEma:\nAt the beginning of the third set... I heard shots.\nPress\nApollo:\nApollo:\nI believe we were having a chat when we heard the shots.\nEma:\nYou were the one chatting. I was eating Snackoos.\nJudge:\nAh! Hey! No snacking in court!\nKlavier:\nAnd you're sure the shots came from Lamiroir's room?\nApollo:\nYes, absolutely.\nEma:\nHey, I'm the one being cross-examined here! Here, this'll keep you quiet!\n*ka-tonk*\nApollo:\nAh, thanks. So...MUNCH...how about it ...MUNCH...Ema?\nEma:\nWe were right...MUNCH...there. Hard to be mistaken about that...MUNCH.\nJudge:\nPlease, either talk, or eat. Not both at the same time!\nEma:\n...... *gulp* Right, so after that... ...me and Mr. Lawyer there opened the dressing room door.\nEma:\nI went into the room, filled with blaring rock music, and found the body.\nPress\nApollo:\nApollo:\nRock?\nEma:\nBlaring, yes.\nJudge:\nWhen you say \"rock\", are you referring, perhaps... ...to this \"rock 'n' roll\" music that's so popular these days?\nApollo:\n(That's right, when we went into the dressing room... ...music was blaring over the speaker on the wall.)\nEma:\nThey pipe sound from the stage into the backstage through speakers. That way people in the back can hear when they're supposed to be on stage.\nApollo:\nDid it have to be so loud?\nKlavier:\nYou don't listen to the Gavinners with your ears. You feel it with your entire body and soul! I always have the backstage monitors at full volume.\nEma:\nWhen we walked in the room... ...the band was playing \"Guilty Love\", I believe. Making it easy to determine the time of the crime.\nJudge:\nHmm... If you could hear that music playing...\nKlavier:\n...Then everyone on stage for that song has an alibi. Including myself.\nEma:\nAnyway, I closed off the scene and started my investigation.\nEma:\nI examined the scene and determined that only the defendant could have done it.\nPress\nApollo:\nApollo:\nHow could you know something like that!?\nEma:\nAs I said, it was clear from the circumstances. Listen... We know there was only one exit from the room: that door. The small window only opened a tiny crack. And I was standing in front of that door. So, how could the killer have fled the scene? There's only one possibility: the air vent.\nJudge:\nAh...\nApollo:\nApollo:\nB-But that air vent was too small! Who could possibly...\nEma:\nExactly.\nApollo:\n...!\nEma:\nThere's certainly no way you could get through. Nor me. The only one who could fit through... was a child.\nApollo:\nA child...\nEma:\nRemember, access to those rooms was limited. Only those involved with the concert were allowed.\nKlavier:\nAnd of all the people involved with the concert... ...only one is small enough to be considered a \"child\".\nJudge:\nThe... The defendant!?\nKlavier:\nThe pixie of the arpeggio flitted up toward the sky... ...and disappeared from the scene of the crime.\nApollo:\nApollo:\nB-But that's just conjecture!\nKlavier:\nOh? There was no other way out of that room. You were there. You should know, Herr Forehead.\nApollo:\n...!\nEma:\nAnd... there is another vital piece of evidence.\nApollo:\nEvidence...? What!?\nEma:\nMarks were found on the air vent grill. Traces that it had recently been opened.\nApollo:\nWait, what...!?\nEma:\nAnd something else was found, quite clearly. The defendant, Machi Tobaye's fingerprints.\nApollo:\nWha... Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order!\nKlavier:\nThat air vent was the only way out of the room! The defendant's fingerprints were found on the grill! ...Well, Herr Forehead? What fairy tale does this suggest to you?\nApollo:\nUrk...!\nKlavier:\nOnly one could pass through that vent, that \"doorway to heaven\"... ...and that one is our pixie.\nApollo:\n......\nTrucy:\nWhy are you looking at me, Apollo? Hey! I was out whooping it up in the audience!\nApollo:\n(So this was his decisive evidence...)\nJudge:\nHmm... Quite decisive, indeed.\nApollo:\n(I know the circumstances under which the body was found... I was there.)\nTrucy:\nAn examination of the crime scene was enough to nail down the killer?\nApollo:\nI'm sure they have a good reason. (They must have had a good reason to arrest Machi... ...And I'm going to find out what it was!)\nAfter pressing first, fourth, and fifth statements:\nJudge:\nI believe that's enough of that.\nApollo:\n!\nJudge:\nThe prosecution has a rather convincing case. The only way in and out of the crime scene was watched. Making the defendant the only one who could possibly leave the scene. Simple, and decisive.\nApollo:\nUgh...\nJudge:\nI believe we've heard enough to determine our verdict. Even if I wasn't in a hurry to make a hospital visit.\nKlavier:\nI'm sure the Chief Justice will appreciate the gesture. Unfortunately, we have no direct witnesses. Fortunately, the criminal left decisive evidence for us. That will have to be enough.\nApollo:\n(Argh! It can't be over already!)\nJudge:\nVery well, I believe this trial is finished. If the defense has no contradicting evidence...?\nKlavier:\nThe prosecution has presented our proof, clear and plain. If you have contradicting evidence... ...it'd better be clear and plain.\nTrucy:\nAck, Apollo! They've got us on the ropes already! We'd better come up with something quick!\nApollo:\nI know! I know! (Think! What can get us out of this!? We need evidence, or a witness, that can prove Machi is innocent beyond a doubt. Without that... *gulp*)\nJudge:\nMr. Justice? Do you have contradicting proof that can overturn the prosecution's case? If you do, you'd better tell us about it now.\nApollo:\n(This is it... and so soon! If I mess this one up, it's all over...!) The court wants contradicting proof?\nPresent evidence\nApollo:\nThe defense is prepared to show contradicting evidence!\nKlavier:\nThis should be interesting! What sort of evidence?\nJudge:\nYes, what sort of evidence, Mr. Justice? Show us evidence contradicting the prosecution's claims!\nPresent anything\nApollo:\nApollo:\nThis evidence does more than contradict, it flips the whole case on its head!\nJudge:\n......\nKlavier:\nThank you for presenting evidence that is both clear and plain, as requested.\nJudge:\nYes... Clearly and plainly wrong! I'm afraid the only thing flipped on its head here was you as a child, Mr. Justice.\nApollo:\n(Ugh... I guess that wasn't it.)\nKlavier:\nMy claim is clear: the only person who could have fled the scene was the defendant.\nJudge:\nAnd there were no witnesses, either.\nKlavier:\nI fear the defense's options are limited, Mr. Justice.\nApollo:\n(Grr! There's only one way out of this... Evidence, or a witness, that can prove Machi's innocence beyond a doubt.)\nJudge:\nLet's ask the defense once again.\nLeads back to:\n\"Do you have contradicting proof that can overturn the prosecution's case?\"\nCall a witness\nLeads to:\n\"Prosecutor Gavin, you claim that there were no witnesses to this crime.\"\nI don't have proof\nApollo:\nI... don't have contradicting proof, actually.\nJudge:\nToo bad. Very well, this court finds the defendant...\n???:\nTrucy:\nW-Waaait!\nJudge:\nWh-What for?\nTrucy:\nWe have, uh, what was it called? Contradictual proof? Anyway, whatever it is, we've got it!\nJudge:\nIs this true?\nTrucy:\nOf course it's true! Show 'em, Apollo!\nApollo:\nWhat the heck are you talking about!?\nTrucy:\nLook, we give up now, Machi's really done for!\nApollo:\n(She's right... If we give up here, we're finished. I need proof or a witness... I must have something...!)\nJudge:\nAlright, we'll give you another chance, then.\nLeads back to:\n\"Do you have contradicting proof that can overturn the prosecution's case?\"\nApollo:\nProsecutor Gavin, you claim that there were no witnesses to this crime. Are you absolutely sure?\nKlavier:\nAbsolutely. I'd swear it on my career as a prosecutor... And on my million-seller hit song \"Atroquinine, My Love\".\nTrucy:\n...There he goes again.\nApollo:\nThat's too bad, because there was a witness.\nJudge:\nHo ho! Really now? But how did you come to possess knowledge the prosecution clearly does not?\nApollo:\nBecause I am the only one in the world who knows this.\nApollo:\n(...What's going on? I just talked to him, and now...)\nLeTouse:\n......Nnnh......\nApollo:\n...! (He... He's alive!) Mr. LeTouse! Can you hear me!?\nLeTouse:\n...Cold... so cold... Witness...\nApollo:\nYou're cold? D-Don't worry, you're going to be fine! Help is on the way!\nLeTouse:\n...Can't s...see...\nApollo:\nHang in there, Mr. LeTouse! Tell me, who was the witness?\nLeTouse:\nThe wi...witness...is ...si...si...ren...\nJudge:\nWhaaat!? The victim said this before he died!?\nKlavier:\nPerhaps he did... and perhaps he did not.\nApollo:\nWhat do you mean by that?\nKlavier:\nAll we know is what Herr Forehead says he said. It's no testimony, especially since it comes from the defense attorney himself.\nApollo:\nApollo:\nBut it's the truth! He said it! I even told you about it! But apparently, you ignored me completely.\nKlavier:\nIt's my policy to fully investigate everything I deem relevant. Clearly this rookie lawyer thinks he can tell me how to do my job.\nJudge:\n...That's enough! Mr. Justice, we need clear contradictory proof from you. This witness of yours, unknown to the prosecution... ...I hope you're right. Failure carries a stiff penalty.\nKlavier:\nPerhaps... A stiffer penalty than usual is called for?\nApollo:\n(Urk! There's no backing out now!)\nJudge:\nLet's hear the name of your witness, Mr. Justice.\nPresent Lamiroir profile\nApollo:\nLeads to:\n\"Lamiroir...?\"\nPresent anyone else\nApollo:\nJudge:\nAnd you claim that they witnessed the murder?\nKlavier:\nThis is a bit unexpected. And you have proof?\nApollo:\nWell, actually... (Uh oh. I can't think of anything.)\nJudge:\nI know that look, Mr. Justice. It's the look of a man who's about to be penalized.\nKlavier:\nI doubted there was a witness in the first place. No one had time! They were far too busy rocking to our wild sounds!\nTrucy:\nMy heart was handcuffed to the stage, I know that!\nEma:\nI felt nothing.\nKlavier:\n...It's sad but true. Some people will never appreciate true art.\nApollo:\n(Why's he pointing at me!? Think, how can I get him to accept there was a witness? I need some kind of proof...)\nJudge:\nLet's start over, shall we?\nLeads back to:\n\"Let's hear the name of your witness, Mr. Justice.\"\nJudge:\nLamiroir...?\nApollo:\nRecall Mr. LeTouse's last words.\nLeTouse:\nThe wi...witness...is ...si...si...ren...\nJudge:\nThe siren... Ah ha! He meant the \"Siren\"!\nApollo:\nThat's right. The \"Siren of the Ballad\"... Lamiroir! Lamiroir was only on stage for the second set... ...and she had access to the backstage area. She could have been a witness!\nJudge:\nI see... Well, Prosecutor Gavin?\nKlavier:\nMy claim still stands. There was no witness to this crime!\nJudge:\nVery well! Let's hear it from the horse's mouth then, shall we? We will now take a break from Detective Ema Skye's cross-examination. ...Please show Lamiroir to the witness stand.\nApollo:\n(Lamiroir would say nothing the night of the murder... Not today, though. Today we'll drag that story out of her no matter what it is!)\nKlavier:\n......\nKlavier:\nIt is my distinct honor to welcome the Siren of the Ballad to our courtroom...\nLamiroir:\nYou are too kind.\nJudge:\nAh, y-you can speak English?\nLamiroir:\nYes... Yes I can. Though I am not very good. ...There is much I do not know.\nJudge:\nYou speak so well! Have you spent time here before?\nLamiroir:\nActually, I do not know how I came by my knowledge of your language. Nor where I studied it...\nApollo:\n...? (What does she mean, she doesn't know...?)\nKlavier:\nI, too, thought to call her as a witness. But I did not. I had a reason, of course.\nApollo:\nWhat's that?\nKlavier:\nLamiroir... suffers from amnesia.\nJudge:\nAmnesia...?\nLamiroir:\nLamiroir... is not my true name. Yet I remember nothing of the time before I was given it. ...Nothing of the time before I started singing on stage.\nTrucy:\nWhoa! She's even more mysterious than I thought!\nKlavier:\nAs lauded singer Lamiroir, she lives a good life. There are little difficulties for her, thanks to her success. Yet... I did not wish to subject her to unnecessary stress.\nJudge:\nHmm... I see. I care surprisingly little about people's pasts. You have nothing to fear in this court, Lamiroir.\nLamiroir:\n...Thank you. Yet there is something I do not understand. I am being called as a witness? What might I say? No one will tell me anything of what happened...\nKlavier:\nLamiroir, let me be frank. I did not want to ask you up here to testify. Yet, that young gentleman with the wide forehead over there was adamant that you stand.\nLamiroir:\nOh my...\nTrucy:\nCongratulations, Apollo. You're the bad guy!\nApollo:\nUgh...\nJudge:\nWell, now that you're here, please give us your testimony. ...If nothing else, the sound of your voice is welcome. Tell us what you saw the night of the crime!\nWitness Testimony\n-- What I Saw --\nLamiroir:\nAs for what I saw... I saw nothing.\nThat night, I was invited to sing on stage, and this I did.\nI did not return backstage after the second set.\nThen I was led by the police to Mr. Gavin's dressing room, and told to wait there.\nThat was where I learned that something had happened... But I wasn't told the details.\nJudge:\nHmm... I must say, you sound wonderful just testifying.\nApollo:\n(I hope he was too distracted to hear what she was actually saying...)\nKlavier:\nThere you have it. She saw nothing that night. Now we can only pray that the defense has the sense to admit defeat. ...And refrain from detaining her here longer than need be.\nTrucy:\nWow, you just got badder, Apollo! Way to go!\nApollo:\nGrr...\nJudge:\nVery well, Mr. Justice. Keep it short and sweet!\nApollo:\n(Lamiroir wouldn't talk to me the night of the crime. She must know something, and I've got to find out what!)\nCross Examination\n-- What I Saw --\nLamiroir:\nAs for what I saw... I saw nothing.\nPress\nApollo:\nApollo:\nBut you must have seen something! Mr. LeTouse named you!\nLamiroir:\nMr. LeTouse... ...How can I tell you what I don't know?\nApollo:\nLamiroir! He said you were a witness with his dying words!\nLamiroir:\nI do not know what he meant to say, but that night...\nLamiroir:\nThat night, I was invited to sing on stage, and this I did.\nPress\nApollo:\nApollo:\nIt... It was a great concert.\nLamiroir:\nYou heard me sing? Thank you.\nApollo:\nI was hoping to get an autograph later, actually...\nLamiroir:\nOf course.\nJudge:\nMr. Justice! This is a cross-examination! You're out of line! ...If anyone deserves an autograph here, it's me. One on my gavel would be nice.\nKlavier:\nHerr Judge.\nJudge:\nWh-What's this?\nKlavier:\nIt's my autograph. Now keep this trial moving.\nJudge:\nWh-What!?\nJudge:\nOh, my grandchild will be so happy!\nApollo:\n(Apparently his grandson is a big fan...)\nKlavier:\nLet us continue, shall we? If you would, Lamiroir... ...Tell us what you did after your stellar performance.\nLamiroir:\nI did not return backstage after the second set.\nPress\nApollo:\nApollo:\nYou did not return backstage once? Where were you then? What were you doing?\nLamiroir:\nI was cleaning up on stage. There are many things I must do for a performance other than simply sing.\nApollo:\nAnd was Machi with you at the time?\nLamiroir:\nUnfortunately, I do not know where he was...\nApollo:\n(So much for an alibi for Machi...)\nPresent Brooch\nApollo:\nApollo:\nI'm sorry Lamiroir, but I'm having trouble believing you.\nLamiroir:\n......\nApollo:\nYou remember this brooch, do you not?\nKlavier:\nWhy that's Lamiroir's. She was wearing it for her song.\nApollo:\n...Care to add that to the testimony, Prosecutor Gavin?\nKlavier:\nWh-What...?\nApollo:\nThis brooch was found after the murder took place. ...At the very scene of the crime!\nKlavier:\nWhat...!?\nApollo:\n...Lamiroir. How did your brooch get backstage if you did not go there yourself? And, as Prosecutor Gavin has just told us... ...you had been wearing it during your performance that night!\nLamiroir:\n...!\nJudge:\nWhat is the meaning of this? Lamiroir, please explain!\nLamiroir:\n......\nApollo:\nLamiroir...?\nLamiroir:\n............ [Foreign text]....\nKlavier:\n...She says, \"English is quite difficult.\"\nApollo:\nThat trick's not going to work here!\nLamiroir:\n[Foreign text]....\nKlavier:\n\"Your forehead may be large, but you are a lawyer, truly. But... you have missed one important fact.\"\nApollo:\nWhat now?\nLamiroir:\n[Foreign text]....\nKlavier:\n\"In fact, at the time of the incident... ...I went backstage, but only for a moment.\"\nApollo:\nWh-Whaat!?\nLamiroir:\n[Foreign text]....\nKlavier:\n\"Think back to the moment of the crime. You know whereof I speak.\"\nApollo:\n(Is she really saying all that?)\nTrucy:\nWhat's she talking about, Apollo?\nApollo:\nRight when the incident occurred... Ah! (Is she talking about that!?)\nEma:\nWatch this room for me. I have to call for backup!\nApollo:\nR-Right, understood. You want me to make sure no one comes in, right? Mr. LeTouse! Can you hear me!?\nLeTouse:\n...Cold...so cold... Witness...\nApollo:\nYou're cold? D-Don't worry, you're going to be fine! Help is on the way!\nLeTouse:\nThe wi...witness...is ...si...si...ren...\nApollo:\n(...\"Siren\"? How can a siren witness anything...?) Yipes! Ema!? (What was that!?) Wh-Who's there!?\nEma:\nWhat's wrong?\nApollo:\nEma! Did you see anyone just now!?\nEma:\nHuh? No...\nApollo:\n(I could have sworn I heard a door close...)\nLamiroir:\nI... looked into the room. Just a glance, mind you.\nKlavier:\nSo this was when your brooch dropped? That explains that.\nLamiroir:\nIt does. There was no other time I could have dropped it.\nApollo:\nBut that's ridiculous! You only looked in for an instant, but you dropped your brooch?\nKlavier:\n...Herr Forehead.\nApollo:\n!\nKlavier:\nShe has raised a possibility. The only thing that can counter that... is evidence.\nJudge:\nHmm... So she looked in at the crime scene.\nLamiroir:\nActually, I intended to go into the dressing room. I knew nothing of what had happened, of course. But the moment I opened the door, I heard a horrible voice.\nKlavier:\nHerr Forehead shouting, \"Who's there!\" no doubt. A horrible voice indeed...\nApollo:\nUgh...\nLamiroir:\nI closed the door immediately.\nJudge:\nWell, that explains the brooch. Let's return to your testimony.\nApollo:\n(That's too convenient... She's hiding something!) Lamiroir! You did look into the room though, right?\nLamiroir:\nY-Yes...\nApollo:\nTestify as to what you saw!\nLamiroir:\nVery well. Though it was only the briefest of glimpses...\nChanges statement from \"I did not return backstage after the second set.\" to \"When my performance was finished, I went backstage for just a moment...\"\nAdds statement \"I saw nothing. The late Mr. LeTouse's body was behind a wall.\"\nLamiroir:\nWhen my performance was finished, I went backstage for just a moment...\nPress\nApollo:\nApollo:\nWhat did you see in that brief glimpse?\nLamiroir:\nI had only opened the door slightly when I heard that horrible voice...\nJudge:\n...And shut the door.\nKlavier:\nI have always wondered, Herr Forehead. Does that voice of yours lack a volume knob?\nApollo:\n(It's my Chords of Steel, man. Just back off!)\nLamiroir:\nI saw nothing. The late Mr. LeTouse's body was behind a wall.\nPress\nApollo:\nApollo:\nA wall...? Was there a wall there?\nLamiroir:\n\"[Foreign text]\" is what in English?\nKlavier:\nA \"division\" or \"partition\", I believe. It was a large dressing room, divided into two halves.\nApollo:\n(And the murder took place in the inside half. I guess that partition might have hidden the body...)\nPerceive swallowing on \"The late Mr. LeTouse's body\"\nApollo:\nApollo:\n\"The late Mr. LeTouse's body\", you say?\nLamiroir:\nYes...?\nApollo:\nYou know something more about Mr. LeTouse's death than you are saying.\nLamiroir:\nWhat...?\nApollo:\nI could see you trying not to remember... But the effort made you swallow! ...You can't fool my eyes.\nLamiroir:\n! ...It is true. It was so terrible, after all. Why did Mr. LeTouse have to be shot?\nApollo:\nOne moment, Lamiroir.\nLamiroir:\nYes...?\nApollo:\nWhat was that you just said? \"Why did Mr. LeTouse have to be shot?\"\nLamiroir:\nYes...?\nApollo:\n(She was hiding something, I knew it!) Lamiroir, I'm afraid you haven't realized it, but... ...your words just now contradict your testimony!\nLamiroir:\nEh? How could that be!?\nApollo:\n(...Take this! Lamiroir contradicted her own testimony, and I have the evidence to prove it!)\nPresent Investigation Request\nApollo:\nLeads to:\n\"Tell me, Lamiroir...\"\nPresent anything else\nApollo:\nLamiroir:\nIf I do not misunderstand the meaning of \"contradiction\"... ...it is you who contradict, Mr. Justice.\nApollo:\nHuh?\nLamiroir:\nYour evidence... is meaningless.\nApollo:\n(Ack! Wrong evidence! Gotta think this over... What did she say again? \"Why did Mr. LeTouse have to be shot\"? That's right... That totally contradicts her testimony!)\nLeads back to:\n\"...Take this!\"\nApollo:\nTell me, Lamiroir... How did you know he had been shot?\nLamiroir:\nEh. Well, I...\nApollo:\nImmediately following the incident, a gag order was placed on the scene. This is the document proving that. In your testimony, you told the court... \"No one told me anything about the incident.\"\nLamiroir:\nAh...\nApollo:\nFurthermore, you testified that you had \"seen nothing\".\nLamiroir:\n...!\nApollo:\nYet you knew that Mr. LeTouse had been shot! How could you have known!?\nLamiroir:\n...! Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeoooooooowrk!\nJudge:\nLamiroir! You aren't hiding something from this court, I hope!\nLamiroir:\n......\nApollo:\n(That sweet song of hers was sounding a little too sweet!)\nLamiroir:\nAh, now I remember. Please... allow me to add to my testimony.\nKlavier:\n...Of course. All we want to know... is the truth.\nTrucy:\nShe looks kind of pale, huh?\nApollo:\nShe saw something, I know it. Even the victim said so!\nChanges statement from \"I saw nothing. The late Mr. LeTouse's body was behind a wall.\" to \"I saw bullet holes in the wall, and knew Mr. LeTouse had been shot...\"\nLamiroir:\nI saw bullet holes in the wall, and knew Mr. LeTouse had been shot...\nPress\nApollo:\nApollo:\nOnly a glimpse, yet you knew they were bullet holes?\nLamiroir:\nYes. I recognized them immediately. I have seen bullet holes before, you know.\nKlavier:\nYou have traveled the world as a singer... You must have sung in places far more dangerous than our country.\nLamiroir:\nI go wherever my voice is needed. Those places... are many, these days.\nTrucy:\nThat's really cool! I hope I get to travel like Lamiroir some day.\nKlavier:\nI plan on recording my next album overseas. Their studios have a different sound, you know.\nApollo:\n(Hmm. Maybe I should go on a Chords of Steel tour, too.)\nPresent Diagram\nApollo:\nLeads to:\n\"Lamiroir. They call you the Siren of the Ballad...\"\nLamiroir:\nThen I was led by the police to Mr. Gavin's dressing room, and told to wait there.\nPress\nApollo:\nApollo:\nWith Machi, correct? How was he then?\nLamiroir:\nHe seemed as he always does. Though I believe he was shocked by the news of Mr. LeTouse's death. Yet... He is not the type to show much emotion.\nKlavier:\nYes. He's given the police no end of headaches. He answers most questions with silence... and those glinting frames speak nothing. The questioning hasn't gotten very far.\nLamiroir:\nWe sat there, waiting...\nLamiroir:\nThat was where I learned that something had happened... But I wasn't told the details.\nPress\nApollo:\nApollo:\nHow was the incident explained to you?\nLamiroir:\nI was told nothing in detail. Only that Mr. LeTouse died.\nJudge:\nOf course, investigations require some security.\nLamiroir:\nBut Mr. LeTouse was my manager! I wanted to know more. I should have been told. Both Machi and I were beside ourselves with concern.\nKlavier:\n...Allow me to apologize. But please understand... ...keeping you in the dark was as painful for me as it was for you.\nLamiroir:\nYes, I understand.\nApollo:\n(Think, what doesn't ring true about her testimony?)\nTrucy:\n...It's hard to imagine Lamiroir lying...\nApollo:\nShe might not be lying, but she's hiding something... (What wouldn't she tell me the night of the murder?)\nApollo:\nLamiroir. They call you the Siren of the Ballad... ...but lies are hardly becoming of such a creature.\nJudge:\n...A put-down worthy of our prosecutor, Mr. Justice.\nTrucy:\n...Such put-downs are hardly becoming of you, Apollo.\nKlavier:\n...Stop polishing your forehead and start polishing your character, ja?\nApollo:\n(C'mon, can't I be cool for once!?) Observe the diagram! Lamiroir, you looked in from the door for just a moment. Correct?\nLamiroir:\nY-Yes, that is so.\nApollo:\nThere were bullet holes in the room, yes. But they were in the wall the door is on!\nLamiroir:\nEh...\nApollo:\nYou see? Assuming you merely glanced into the room... ...you couldn't have seen those bullet holes!\nLamiroir:\nYeeeeeeeeeeeeeooowrk!\nJudge:\n...... Lamiroir.\nLamiroir:\n...Yes.\nJudge:\nI'm afraid the defense has raised a good point. It appears you have been holding back something.\nLamiroir:\n...And I must tell you? I must tell you what it is that I saw?\nJudge:\nYes. The happenings in this trial are being recorded. And I'm certain it will be on the news in Borginia. You understand your reputation is at stake. It falls to you to avoid tarnishing it.\nKlavier:\nPersonally speaking... I still believe that cross-examining her will yield us absolutely nothing.\nApollo:\nBut she knew how Mr. LeTouse died! And he named her as a witness! You must have seen something, Lamiroir!\nJudge:\n...Very well. Lamiroir... Please continue your testimony.\nLamiroir:\n... Very well, I shall.\nWitness Testimony\n-- What I Saw 2 --\nLamiroir:\nI was on my way from the stage to the backstage exit.\nThere was something like a little window there... That's how I saw it.\nThere were two shots... I couldn't do anything to stop it.\nBut it wasn't Machi!\nIt was a grown person! ...I know it was!\nJudge:\nSo you did witness the crime! And the killer was... a grown person, you say?\nKlavier:\nAch. This is my first time hearing this, I assure you. Nice play, Herr Forehead.\nApollo:\n......\nJudge:\nVery well, Herr... er, Mr. Justice. You may begin your cross-examination!\nTrucy:\nGreat going, Apollo! You were right about Lamiroir. ...What's wrong? You don't look too happy.\nApollo:\n(This whole thing smells fishy... That's what's wrong.)\nTrucy:\n...?\nCross Examination\n-- What I Saw 2 --\nLamiroir:\nI was on my way from the stage to the backstage exit.\nPress\nApollo:\nApollo:\nSo you were heading toward the dressing room?\nLamiroir:\nYes.\nApollo:\n(So this is a little before she opened the dressing room door and dropped her brooch. ...About the same time Ema and I heard those shots.)\nLamiroir:\nI was on my way back...\nLamiroir:\nThere was something like a little window there... That's how I saw it.\nPress\nApollo:\nApollo:\nUm, what exactly is something like a little window?\nLamiroir:\nYes, well... \"Window\" is the best word I know in English. I think this is how it is said, yes.\nKlavier:\nYou need not worry, Lamiroir. Your choice of words is impeccable. There is a small window in the dressing room in question. Perhaps the defense remembers this detail?\nApollo:\n(That little window on the wall...)\nLamiroir:\nI, er, saw the crime from there.\nLamiroir:\nThere were two shots... I couldn't do anything to stop it.\nPress\nApollo:\nApollo:\nYou are certain you heard two shots fired?\nLamiroir:\nYes, quite certain. I was on my way to the backstage exit. This was when I heard a faint sound... like a gunshot. Wondering what it had been, I peered through the window. That is when I heard the second gunshot, much closer.\nApollo:\n(And there were two bullet holes at the scene... no contradictions so far.)\nLamiroir:\n...It all happened on the other side of that window. There was nothing I could do.\nLamiroir:\nBut it wasn't Machi!\nPress\nApollo:\nApollo:\nIt wasn't Machi who shot... Are you sure?\nLamiroir:\nYes, quite certain.\nKlavier:\nAh ha ha... It amuses me that you would question her testimony. It is testimony in your favor! Isn't it my job to object?\nTrucy:\nYeah, Apollo, what were you thinking!?\nApollo:\nTrucy... Let's just listen to what Lamiroir has to say. Can you tell me how you were so sure?\nLamiroir:\nYes, of course. You see...\nLamiroir:\nIt was a grown person! ...I know it was!\nPress\nApollo:\nLeads to:\n\"A \"grown person\"... That's a little vague.\"\nTrucy:\nYou can't ask for a better testimony than that!\nApollo:\nI'm not so sure it's all that simple, Trucy. (There's a critical flaw in this testimony... And I have to point it out, even if it isn't good for our case...)\nApollo:\nA \"grown person\"... That's a little vague.\nLamiroir:\nI am sorry. My skill with your language is... lacking, I know.\nJudge:\nCertainly you could at least see whether the shooter was male or female?\nLamiroir:\n...... It was a man. A young man.\nJudge:\nAnd you're sure of that?\nLamiroir:\nYes, his voice was quite clear.\nApollo:\nVoice...?\nJudge:\nHmm... Looking at this diagram, it seems the dressing room was quite cluttered. It does seem likely that you wouldn't have had a clear view of the shooter.\nLamiroir:\nAs a singer, I rely more on my ears than my eyes. When I hear a voice, I do not forget it. That voice... was the voice of a man.\nKlavier:\nSo you heard a voice. But wait... ...Couldn't that have been the victim, Mr. LeTouse?\nLamiroir:\nAbsolutely not. Did I not just say that I do not forget a voice? If it was Mr. LeTouse who spoke, I would have known.\nJudge:\nHmm... Indeed. So you were at the window, and you heard the shooter's voice, the voice of a young man.\nTrucy:\nApollo! This is a good testimony! That proves it wasn't Machi!\nApollo:\n......\nJudge:\nIndeed... If this turns out to be true, it would cast this case in a considerably different light. What is the defense's opinion of this testimony...?\nIt's pretty good\nApollo:\n...Well, I'd have to say it's pretty good. Vital, even. This shows that the shooter wasn't Machi...\nKlavier:\nHah!\nApollo:\n...!\nKlavier:\nSurely you can't be serious, Herr Forehead.\nApollo:\nWh-Why not!?\nLeads to:\n\"Lamiroir.\"\nIt's contradictory\nApollo:\nThough it pains me to say this... ...There's something about Lamiroir's testimony that rings false.\nLamiroir:\n...!\nKlavier:\nHeh. Bravo, Herr Forehead. You're colder than I thought.\nApollo:\n(I'm sure you remember what the problem is as well as I do, Gavin.) As has been established... No grown man could pass through that air vent. He couldn't have fled the scene of the crime.\nLamiroir:\n......\nTrucy:\nB-But that means Lamiroir has to be lying!\nApollo:\nI know, and I know it's bad for our case, but I can't shut my eyes to this. (Believe me, the idea was tempting...)\nKlavier:\nIt is as Herr Forehead says. Yet, this is not the only contradiction within her testimony.\nApollo:\nWh-What next!? (What's he talking about?)\nLeads to:\n\"Lamiroir.\"\nKlavier:\nLamiroir. I understand why you would want to protect Machi. Yet remember, you are the Siren of the Ballad... ...And lies do not become such a creature.\nJudge:\nWhat does the prosecution mean!?\nTrucy:\nApollo! What's he talking about!?\nApollo:\n(How come no one bats an eye when he says stuff like that?)\nKlavier:\nI recall the state of the crime scene quite well.\nApollo:\nThe state of the room...?\nKlavier:\nYes, and when the murder took place... ...that window was closed. I find it hard to believe you could hear a voice through it.\nLamiroir:\nWhat!? B-But I... I'm sure...\nKlavier:\n...Lamiroir. I have nothing but the highest regard for your musical sense. ...But my opinion of you as a witness is somewhat lesser.\nApollo:\nApollo:\nB-But she's the only eye-witness we have!\nKlavier:\nKlavier:\nSo you say. And the victim named her, the \"Siren\" as the witness?\nApollo:\nTh-That's right! That's what Mr. LeTouse...\nKlavier:\nWe heard your claim. We even entertained the possibility. And it brought us to this. Herr Judge!\nJudge:\nYes?\nKlavier:\nThe prosecution requests that the witness... be excused. Please.\nJudge:\nHmm... I'm afraid I must honor the prosecution's request. There is indeed a question of the witness's credibility.\nApollo:\nB-But if Lamiroir can't testify...\nTrucy:\nThen we don't have a chance of proving Machi's innocence.\nJudge:\nThis cross-examination is over! ...Prosecutor Gavin. You may continue making your case.\nKlavier:\n...Danke. Now where were we? Ah yes, I would like to hear from Fräulein Detective again.\nApollo:\nApollo:\nWait! Let me hear Lamiroir's testimony one last time...\nJudge:\nBut the cross-examination is already over. Until such a time as a need arises... ...this witness may leave the stand.\nLamiroir:\n...... I'm sorry I could not be of more assistance.\nKlavier:\n......\nKlavier:\nAt last, back to the real trial. Ready, Herr Forehead?\nApollo:\n(Grr... I hope I didn't just miss my only chance.)\nKlavier:\nFräulein Detective, how far had we gotten until we were so rudely interrupted?\nEma:\nDon't ask me!\nKlavier:\nI dislike saying the same thing twice. And I never repeat a song for an encore.\nJudge:\n...If you would, Ms. Skye.\nEma:\n...Hmph. I believe I was saying that the only way Mr. LeTouse's killer could have escaped... ...was through that air vent on the ceiling.\nJudge:\nAh, yes, there was only one door in the room. And a witness, you, was standing in front of it.\nEma:\nThat air vent isn't very big, see. Kind of limits the people who could possibly get through.\nJudge:\nI certainly would have a difficult time.\nEma:\nYou sure would. Not that you would have been there in the first place, though. Remember, the whole backstage area was off-limits to people not involved with the concert. The only one who meets the conditions for our killer... is the defendant.\nKlavier:\n...A virtuoso performance! I couldn't have put it better myself.\nJudge:\nHmm. She does state a clear case. Though, reading the report, something caught my eye.\nKlavier:\nOh? What's that?\nJudge:\nThe circumstances of the defendant's arrest.\nApollo:\nThe circumstances...? (Again...?)\nTrucy:\nHey, that's right, Apollo! Remember when we found Machi? That was bizarre!\nApollo:\n(She's right... Why did Mr. LeTouse's body disappear from the room... ...and end up on top of that stage tower? ...Holding a guitar, no less.)\nKlavier:\n...A perceptive observation, Herr Judge.\nJudge:\nAh, er, thanks! It was kind of an accident, really. But you work in this job long enough... ...you get a nose for things. Eh he he.\nTrucy:\nThe judge sure seems pleased with himself!\nKlavier:\nVery good, Fräulein Detective. Perhaps you can tie it all together for us. Why was the body moved? And how does that lead us to the killer!?\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Missing Body --\nEma:\nI believe Machi stole the body because of some lyrics.\nHe moved the body to match Lamiroir's song.\nNo one in this country had a motive to kill the victim.\nAnd, Machi practically left his signature at the scene.\nAll of the evidence clearly points to the defendant.\nApollo:\nLamiroir's... song?\nKlavier:\nYes... \"The Guitar's Serenade\". You noticed its \"code\" too, did you not?\nApollo:\nIts \"code\"...?\nKlavier:\nAll the events that day followed the lyrics to our song. First, the keys my \"heart\" held on to so tightly were stolen.\nApollo:\nThen Prosecutor Gavin's guitar burst into flames on stage. Mr. LeTouse's life was taken by a bullet...\nKlavier:\nThe rest hardly needs explanation... \"Guitar, Guitar... Up together to the sky.\"\nJudge:\nTh-That's mad! It's like a story out of some fairy tale!\nApollo:\n(I admit, I'd forgotten about the song... But there it is now, waiting for me... the grand finale, as it were.)\nTrucy:\nHey! You know I was the one who first noticed that!\nJudge:\nI've heard of jumping rope to songs, and counting to songs... ...But killing!?\nKlavier:\nIt's a wild world out there, Herr Judge.\nJudge:\nVery well! We've heard one song and dance, let's get on to the next: the cross-examination!\nApollo:\n(I'm not so sure I'm going to be doing much singing...)\nCross Examination\n-- The Missing Body --\nEma:\nI believe Machi stole the body because of some lyrics.\nPress\nApollo:\nApollo:\nWho would steal a body just to match some lyrics!?\nEma:\nI didn't believe it myself. But it can't just be a coincidence.\nKlavier:\nIt is as Fräulein Detective says. Let us begin with the first verse. If you would, Fräulein Detective.\nEma:\nWhat? You want me to sing it?\nKlavier:\nYou are the witness, ja? Or did you want me to sing? I warn you, my fee as vocalist is not trivial.\nEma:\nFine, fine! Er, ahem. Let's look at the first part of the lyrics, shall we? \"When you stole away the keys my heart held on to so tight.\"\nKlavier:\nIndeed, my favorite heart-shaped key ring was stolen that morning.\nEma:\nNext, we go to the right page of the lyrics sheet. Where we find... \"Burning on in my heart. Fire. Burn my love away. All away.\" As we know, Prosecutor Gavin's guitar burst into flame. \"Like a bullet of love. Fire. Take my life away. All away.\" Mr. LeTouse's life was taken by a bullet.\nKlavier:\nBravo, Fräulein Detective. Your singing... it's not bad. Now, for the finale! \"Guitar, Guitar... Up together to the sky.\" As it says in the lyrics, Mr. LeTouse... ...was found with a guitar, high in the \"sky\" over the stage. No series of coincidences could be so well conceived!\nEma:\nHe's right. ...Scientifically speaking.\nApollo:\n(What would Wocky have said? ...\"That concert was wack.\")\nTrucy:\nIt's hard to argue when she pours her heart into it like that.\nEma:\nAh, er, ahem! Anyway, the shooter...\nEma:\nHe moved the body to match Lamiroir's song.\nPress\nApollo:\nApollo:\nDoes the prosecution have any idea why he'd do all this?\nEma:\nYou want my scientific opinion? \"No clue.\" But, he clearly had a reason to go through all that trouble. Some deep reason.\nApollo:\nA deep reason?\nKlavier:\nNot only did he steal my keys, he torched my guitar! ...Unforgivable acts even if he had a reason... and worse if he had none!\nEma:\nThe diva's complaints aside, I can't imagine someone doing this on \"just a whim\".\nKlavier:\nFräulein Detective! I take offense at that description...\nJudge:\nIndeed, it does seem too well rehearsed, shall we say.\nEma:\nYes. This crime was planned for sure.\nEma:\nNo one in this country had a motive to kill the victim.\nPress\nApollo:\nApollo:\nBut... Mr. LeTouse spoke English! He may have come to this country before!\nEma:\nI looked into that, I assure you.\nApollo:\nOh.\nEma:\n...It was his first time in the country, it seems. Apparently, he learned English on his own.\nApollo:\n(Great...)\nKlavier:\nYou see? No one here had a motive to kill him, and certainly not in such an elaborate fashion.\nJudge:\nHmm... It does seem difficult to imagine.\nEma:\nUnless our famous prosecutor did it as a publicity stunt.\nKlavier:\nWh-What did you say!?\nJudge:\nProsecutor Gavin! You did this to promote your song!?\nKlavier:\n...... Of course not, and I am quite dismayed by the ludicrous nature of her claim. Why would I need promotion? Everyone already listens to my music.\nTrucy:\nThey're even in my textbook at school.\nApollo:\n(And I'd never heard of them. What does that say about me?)\nEma:\nI was just kidding! Don't get all worked up, glimmer-boy.\nEma:\nAnd, Machi practically left his signature at the scene.\nPress\nApollo:\nApollo:\nWhat do you mean by his \"signature\"?\nEma:\nThe bullet holes in the wall, of course.\nApollo:\nThe bullet holes...?\nEma:\nThe revolver was fired twice. One shot missed, and left a hole in the wall.\nJudge:\nAnd that means what, exactly?\nEma:\nThat dressing room isn't exactly spacious. Picture the shooter facing off with the victim in there. They can't have been more than five feet apart. It would be difficult, almost impossible to miss at that range.\nJudge:\nDifficult to miss, you say?\nEma:\nVery. Assuming the shooter could properly aim.\nApollo:\nNo! Y-You can't be serious...\nTrucy:\nMachi! He can't see... ...That's why he missed?\nEma:\nIt's the only explanation that makes sense. He used sound and other senses to fire the gun... ...poorly.\nKlavier:\nThat reminds me, the monitor in that room was blaring at the time, ja? Hardly ideal conditions for tracking by sound.\nJudge:\nA blind shooter... No wonder he missed!\nApollo:\n(I knew those bullet holes would come back to haunt me. Think Justice, what do I do now!?)\nRaise an objection\nApollo:\nSure, there were bullet holes left in the wall... ...but that doesn't prove the shooter couldn't see!\nKlavier:\nOh? How so?\nApollo:\nWell, there could have been a struggle with the victim.\nJudge:\nHmm, that's certainly possible.\nApollo:\nAnd... it might have been the revolver's fault.\nJudge:\nThe revolver...?\nApollo:\nThe revolver was a very large caliber, correct?\nJudge:\nIf the shooter wasn't used to firing such a large weapon... Why, it could dislocate their shoulder.\nApollo:\n...Exactly. The defendant, Machi Tobaye, is, as you can see, tiny. It's not so hard to picture him firing the gun and missing entirely! The kickback alone would throw off his aim.\nJudge:\n......\nKlavier:\n......\nEma:\n......\nJudge:\nA convincing argument, to be sure.\nApollo:\n(Ha ha! Take that, smug prosecution!)\nTrucy:\nUm, Apollo?\nApollo:\nHuh? What?\nTrucy:\nThat bit about Machi being tiny... ...and the gun throwing off his aim? Um, aren't you kind of, um... ...admitting that he did it?\nApollo:\n......Oh.\nKlavier:\nIt does not matter why he missed. What matters is that the shooter was, without a doubt, the defendant. Even the defense seems to agree on that point.\nApollo:\nYurk! Uhh... (Cripes! I really put my foot in it this time!)\nKlavier:\nBut, let's get the facts of the matter on the record. If you would, Fräulein Detective.\nJudge:\nVery well. The witness will add this to her testimony.\nEma:\nRight.\nChanges statement from \"All of the evidence clearly points to the defendant.\" to \"From the state of the crime scene, I conclude the shooter was blind.\"\nSit back and watch\nApollo:\n(He couldn't see, so the first shot missed... ...As explanations go, it's airtight.)\nJudge:\nHmm... It appears the shooter did leave his signature. I'm afraid this is looking bad for our young defendant. The witness may continue with her testimony.\nEma:\nYou got it.\nLeads back to cross-examination\nPress (after adding statement)\nApollo:\nBy \"signature\", you mean the bullet holes in the wall?\nEma:\nThat's right. Allow me to explain it... scientifically. The murder weapon was fired twice. The shot that missed left a hole in the wall. Furthermore, there was no more than five feet between shooter and victim. Hard to miss at that distance.\nTrucy:\nBut, Machi can't see...\nEma:\nHe would have had to use sound and other senses to aim... ...and miss.\nKlavier:\nAnd our music was blaring over the room monitor. Not the best circumstances for aiming by sound.\nEma:\nWhich makes it very likely that the shooter was blind.\nKlavier:\nThus the prosecution's position.\nEma:\nAhh! Nothing like a scientific explanation to get the blood pumping!\nApollo:\n(Why's mine frozen in my veins, then...?)\nEma:\nAll of the evidence clearly points to the defendant.\nPress\nApollo:\nApollo:\nBut, but you can't say that for sure!\nEma:\nPlease, none of those non-scientific objections. They're bad for my complexion.\nApollo:\nWhat's so scientific about a murder to lyrics!?\nEma:\nLyrics can be explained scientifically! ...Never underestimate the power of science!\nApollo:\n(Put that bottle of finger-printing powder down before you hurt someone, like me!) OK, then explain it! Scientifically!\nEma:\n...... I require more data.\nApollo:\n(Hah! Likely story...)\nEma:\nFrom the state of the crime scene, I conclude the shooter was blind.\nPress\nApollo:\nApollo:\nYou can't say he was blind just because of those bullet holes in the wall! I think I've proven that!\nEma:\n...I wouldn't call it \"proof\", per se.\nApollo:\nHuh?\nKlavier:\nYou've merely raised a \"possibility\".\nApollo:\n...!\nKlavier:\nFräulein Detective has made a most logical conjecture based upon the evidence. Of course, there is more evidence than just bullet holes. The defendant was the only one who could have escaped through the air vent.\nApollo:\nApollo:\nBut wait! If he was blind... ...how would he know about the air vent in the first place?\nKlavier:\n...Ah, a very good point. Well, Fräulein Detective? If you would care to explain?\nApollo:\n(He certainly seems sure of himself...)\nEma:\nRecall the crime scene, if you would. There was a stepladder below the air vent. As it happens, maintenance was scheduled for that day. Custodial staff went around checking all the air vents.\nApollo:\nI don't believe it.\nEma:\nEveryone backstage was told about the maintenance. ...Including Machi Tobaye. He would have known that there would be a way out at the top of that stepladder.\nApollo:\nBut that's... Why is this the first time I'm hearing about this!?\nKlavier:\nYou could have figured it out for yourself. You only needed to consider what that stepladder was doing there.\nJudge:\n...Looks like the defense's objection has been squished by a stepladder.\nKlavier:\nWell, Herr Forehead? Out of ammunition, perhaps?\nApollo:\n(I've never seen Prosecutor Gavin so... so aggressive! Maybe he's caught the scent of blood...)\nTrucy:\nApollo! Don't you have something? Anything? You know what we need... We need something to prove the killer could see! That'll put him in his place!\nKlavier:\n......\nApollo:\n(Proving the shooter was sighted would do it. That would take down one of their central points... Do I have any evidence that can prove that though...?)\nPresent evidence\nApollo:\nFine... I accept the prosecution's challenge.\nKlavier:\nAs I knew you would, Herr Forehead.\nApollo:\n(What exactly am I up against here...? The prosecution is saying the shooter missed because he or she couldn't see... Therefore, Machi, who's blind, did it.)\nJudge:\nThe defense will please present their evidence. ...Evidence that overturns the prosecution's claim that the shooter couldn't see!\nPresent Crime Photo\nApollo:\nLeads to:\n\"This is that evidence!\"\nPresent anything else\nApollo:\nJudge:\n...... I'm not sure that overturns anything, Mr. Justice.\nApollo:\n(Ugh. Wrong evidence, I'm guessing...)\nKlavier:\nApparently both love... and Justice are blind.\nApollo:\n(I have to think! There must be something... anything!)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nNo need\nApollo:\n(I can't think of anything that proves the shooter could see!)\nKlavier:\nYour face does not exactly project... confidence.\nEma:\nMaybe you should just accept it and move on?\nTrucy:\nApollo! Grow a backbone!\nJudge:\nVery well. The witness may continue her testimony.\nApollo:\n(I couldn't even get a word in edgewise...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\nPresent Crime Photo\nApollo:\nApollo:\nThe prosecution holds that the \"shooter couldn't see\".\nEma:\nA scientific conclusion based on a thorough examination of the crime scene, yes.\nApollo:\nApparently not thorough enough. I have a certain piece of evidence that completely overturns your claim!\nEma:\nWh-What!?\nKlavier:\n......\nLeads to:\n\"This is that evidence!\"\nTrucy:\nThis doesn't look so good, does it, Apollo?\nApollo:\nNo, it doesn't.\nTrucy:\n...... What do we do!?\nApollo:\n(First, we don't panic. Even though Machi's case is leaking water by the gallon. Gavin's on a roll, and it's up to me to stop him!)\nApollo:\nThis is that evidence!\nJudge:\nThe photograph of the crime scene...?\nApollo:\n(I don't care much for the smirk on Prosecutor Gavin's face... But this is no time to think twice... Time to press on!) Yes, Your Honor, the crime scene. There is something in here that decisively contradicts the prosecution's point!\nKlavier:\nThen perhaps you'd best show us this \"something\". Get your finger out of the breeze and put it to good use, ja?\nJudge:\nVery well, show us what you're talking about, Mr. Justice! The contradiction at the scene of the crime is...\nPresent smeared blood\nApollo:\nLeads to:\n\"The contradiction is right here!\"\nPresent anywhere else\nApollo:\nApollo:\nLook! The contradiction's right there! Plain as day!\nJudge:\n...... Your finger has a force of weight... ...that I'm afraid your argument lacks, Mr. Justice. I see nothing!\nApollo:\n(Ugh... What a time to mess up.)\nKlavier:\nI believe all he has added to our understanding of this photo... is his fingerprint. I would hope you could refrain from soiling the evidence, Herr Forehead.\nJudge:\nPerhaps Mr. Justice would care to try again?\nLeads back to:\n\"The contradiction at the scene of the crime is...\"\nApollo:\nThe contradiction is right here!\nEma:\nThe smeared blood stains...!\nJudge:\nHmm... I thought it was just my blurry vision. But it really was blurry! The way the victim's hand is raised above his head... ...Much like a gesture I have seen many times in this court.\nEma:\nIt's almost as if he wrote something...?\nTrucy:\nAh ha! I get it! At least, I think I get it!\nKlavier:\nGet what, Fräulein?\nTrucy:\nWhen Mr. LeTouse was shot, he tried to write something! And what would he write but the shooter's name? And what would he write it in but his own blood? Pretty good, huh?\nApollo:\n(Thanks for making my point for me...) Yes, in fact, that's what I think happened here.\nJudge:\nHmm... That does seem to be a distinct possibility.\nEma:\nThe victim wrote the killer's name... ...It's certainly a logical conclusion.\nTrucy:\nDrat! I just wish it wasn't all rubbed out like that.\nJudge:\nOf course it's rubbed out. Why, if I were a killer... ...I certainly wouldn't want to leave my own name behind!\nKlavier:\nNeither would I.\nEma:\n......\nKlavier:\n......\nJudge:\n......\nApollo:\nUm... No one has anything else to say?\nJudge:\n...About what?\nApollo:\nSo the prosecution accepts this? You agree this was the victim making an attempt to record the name of the killer? ...And that the killer tried to rub the name out?\nEma:\nWhat's your point?\nApollo:\nWhat's my point!? Let me ask you this: How did the killer know the victim was writing their name?\nEma:\nWell, Mr. LeTouse was writing something in blood. Once the killer saw what it was... ...Wait.\nJudge:\nOnce he \"saw\" what it was...?\nApollo:\nBut what did you just testify about the shooter?\nEma:\nI said... they were blind. Ack!!!\nApollo:\nYet the crime scene itself contradicts that! The killer had to have been able to see! Why would they rub out the name in blood otherwise?\nEma:\nAh... ahh...\nApollo:\nMay I remind the court that the defendant, Machi Tobaye, is blind! He couldn't have been the shooter!\nEma:\nUrk... Immmmmmmmposssssibbleee!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order!!! P-Prosecutor Gavin! Please explain to me what all this means!?\nKlavier:\n......\nJudge:\nI mean, looking at this photo... It seems quite clear that the shooter could see! Yet, up until now...\nKlavier:\n...It seems I owe the court an apology.\nJudge:\nHmm!?\nKlavier:\nThe Gavinners are a band with law enforcement ties, yet a murder occurred... ...during our concert! Apparently, this caused some confusion over jurisdiction. As a result, some reports were not filed in an entirely timely manner.\nApollo:\n(I... I'm not sure I like the vibe I'm getting here.)\nTrucy:\nHey Apollo, look at him. Why is Prosecutor Gavin all relaxed and smiling like that? Like he knows something we don't... and he's about to tell us.\nKlavier:\nHeh heh heh. I've got an idea... Let's rock! ...With these documents. But before that. I have a question for the Fräulein Detective. If I may?\nEma:\nWh-What?\nKlavier:\nTell me... Why do you think that Machi Tobaye is blind?\nEma:\nHuh...?\nApollo:\nWh-What did he say?\nEma:\nWhat are you saying? Of course he's blind!\nKlavier:\nOf course...?\nEma:\nH-He's the blind pianist, right? So... So he's... Doesn't Lamiroir lead him around by the hand all the time?\nApollo:\n(No way...)\nKlavier:\nI have a report here on the defendant, Machi Tobaye. According to this, Machi Tobaye... ...can see perfectly well.\nEma:\nWhat...?\nKlavier:\nHis blindness was merely a publicity ploy by those clever Borginians. He can see quite well.\nApollo:\nApollo:\nB-But you said...\nKlavier:\n...What did I say, exactly?\nApollo:\n!\nKlavier:\nHerr Forehead, not once in the course of this trial... ...have I claimed the defendant was blind. The only one who did was Fräulein Detective.\nApollo:\nBu-But that's...\nKlavier:\n...A significant fact, yes! Consider: Machi Tobaye sees. And he was the only one who could have fled through the air vent. I see no problems with this.\nEma:\nBut what about the bullet holes in the wall?\nKlavier:\nYes, the bullet holes. I believe Herr Forehead neatly explained those for us. He didn't miss because he couldn't see. It was the kickback from the 45-caliber revolver. A simple accident, in other words.\nApollo:\nAck...!\nKlavier:\nHow's that? I'm afraid your \"objection\" has just flown off for brighter skies...\nApollo:\nUrk...\nKlavier:\nThis is where the real fun begins, Herr Forehead!\nApollo:\nYeeeeaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrggh!\nKlavier:\nI knew you didn't have what it took.\nEma:\nYou... You jerk! Just what was I in here for? Comic relief!?\nTrucy:\nYeah! Apologize!\nKlavier:\nAh ha ha. Oh, sorry!\nTrucy:\nThat's no way to apologize!\nApollo:\n(He's angered the Trucy now. Look out...)\nJudge:\nAhem. If we can please end the bickering. Now.\nEma:\nWhatever! I'm not leaving! I can't leave like this. I'll come up with some clue to solving this case if it kills me!\nJudge:\nBut your testimony has already given us enough to convict the defendant...\nApollo:\n(Ugh, don't say that...)\nEma:\nAh! Ah ha!\nApollo:\n\"Ah ha\" what?\nEma:\nThis blood stain... The criminal tried to wipe it off, right?\nApollo:\nThat seems to be what happened, yes.\nEma:\nWe might be able to find out what was really written here!\nApollo:\n...! Really...? You can do that?\nEma:\nThat's right, with this! It's called Luminol! Maybe you know of it? It's a chemical that reacts to blood.\nKlavier:\nAh yes, have we done those tests yet...?\nEma:\nHah! As if I'm going to tell you!\nKlavier:\nThe blood stains covered a section of the carpet. In order to perform blood tests, that section was removed and submitted. Perhaps we should request it here in court now.\nEma:\nRight! Go for it, Apollo!\nApollo:\nHuh? I have to do the test?\nEma:\nYou just have to spray the luminol on it! Simple!\nApollo:\n(A chemical that reacts to blood... I've heard of this somewhere.)\nJudge:\n...Yes, I believe an analysis is called for. Have at it!\nEma:\nRight, ready? It's easy as pie! Just press [A / Space] to spray an area. (Changed from [Just touch the screen to spray an area.] in the original release) Here! Give it a try!\nApollo:\n(...The eyes of the entire court are focused on me!)\nTrucy:\nApollo! Your hand's shaking!\nApollo:\n(Ugh... Grrrah! Let's do this!)\nSpray smeared writing\nLeads to:\n\"Wow... it really works!\"\nApollo:\n(Wow... it really works!)\nTrucy:\nThis must be... this must be the power of science!\nEma:\nIt says... \"IPXX314206\"... ...Is that the killer's name?\nJudge:\nHmm. Maybe it is... if the killer was a robot!\nKlavier:\nAh hah! I have it!\nApollo:\n...So what is it?\nKlavier:\nI thought those letters \"IPXX\" looked familiar. This is an Interpol ID number.\nEma:\nI-Interpol? You mean the international police agency?\nKlavier:\nYes. Most are undercover agents working to solve international crimes. But why would he write that number...?\nApollo:\nWhy would Mr. LeTouse even know a number like that!?\nKlavier:\nGood show, Fräulein Detective. Rock on.\nEma:\nEh?\nKlavier:\nYour Honor! We can verify this number immediately. ...Daryan, are you there? Come up to the witness stand!\nKlavier:\nDaryan... you heard what we need. Go check into this Interpol ID number.\nDaryan:\nSure thing. Gimme 30 minutes. No... Gimme 27.\nJudge:\nHmm... I'm not sure what to think of all this. The prosecution's case is airtight, or so it seems. Yet if this number is really that of an Interpol agent...\nEma:\nOh, wait, I know... What if Machi Tobaye's really an undercover Interpol agent?\nKlavier:\nThat would be a possibility.\nJudge:\nA possibility, yes. And one that would mark him as the killer for certain.\nApollo:\n(Why did LeTouse know an Interpol ID number...? That's what I want to know.)\nKlavier:\nWell, we have some time while we await Daryan's report. Let's work on unraveling another mystery, shall we? A curious mystery concerning Machi Tobaye.\nApollo:\n...What are you talking about?\nKlavier:\nFräulein Detective, please accept my apologies. I received word that the defendant could, in fact, see, just before the trial began. It seemed too much of a bother to tell you.\nEma:\n...You had me until that last bit.\nKlavier:\nDoes this not raise a rather straightforward question?\nEma:\nWell, sure... Why did Machi pretend he couldn't see?\nKlavier:\nExactly... It makes little sense. What do you think, Herr Forehead?\nApollo:\nHuh? Me?\nKlavier:\nMachi Tobaye pretended he was blind... ...Do you know why?\nEma:\nHow could he know!?\nTrucy:\nWait... Prosecutor Gavin knows why, doesn't he...\nApollo:\n(He's known from the start of the trial. He's been leading us on the whole time!)\nKlavier:\nHmm? Something wrong? Do you think, perhaps, this is all some kind of game? Know that the moment I heard that report... ...I knew why.\nJudge:\nHmm... I suppose people who have sold over a million records really are something else.\nApollo:\n(What does that have to do with anything!?)\nKlavier:\nThere was a reason why Machi Tobaye pretended to be blind. But it wasn't for his own sake. ...Getting the picture now?\nApollo:\nIt wasn't for himself...!?\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Justice? Can you present evidence that shows us why the defendant had to feign blindness?\nShow evidence\nApollo:\n(Machi had no reason to pretend he couldn't see... Which means... No. It couldn't be!)\nKlavier:\n...Good show, Herr Forehead. It seems you've thought of something.\nApollo:\n(Grr... Why can't I figure these things out on my own? I hate having to take my cues from this guy.) ...Very well. Look at this. This is why he was pretending he couldn't see!\nPresent Postcard\nApollo:\nJudge:\nThat is... Lamiroir?\nApollo:\nLamiroir and Machi Tobaye. Recall their relationship. In particular, their unique arrangement over the years before visiting our country.\nEma:\nLamiroir and her pianist... They would always walk together, she leading him by the hand. Even when they got on stage, she would lead him to the piano. She would walk all the way over there with him!\nApollo:\nThat's right. Because he was \"blind\". She led him at all times, never letting him go.\nJudge:\nAll times... Hmm.\nApollo:\nYet, we have just learned something that makes their arrangement peculiar indeed. Machi could see! Why did they have to keep up this act the whole time?\nJudge:\nWell, wasn't it part of their, er, performance?\nApollo:\nI think there's a simpler explanation. Machi did not need to be led by the hand at all. That can only mean one thing.\nEma:\nAh! Aaaaaaaaaaa... Really!?\nApollo:\nReally. It was all the other way around. The one who needed to be led by the hand... ...was Lamiroir!\nJudge:\nWh-What's this...? S-So you mean to say that Lamiroir is... she's...\nApollo:\nYes, Your Honor. Lamiroir is blind.\nEma:\nWha... Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order!!! This is crazy, Prosecutor Gavin!\nKlavier:\nIs it now?\nJudge:\nPlease... Please shed some sanity on this madness! The defense has made an outrageous claim...\nKlavier:\nThe only thing outrageous I see about the defense is his vast forehead... ...Yet I see it is not vast in vain. This time. He's quite correct.\nJudge:\nB-But that makes no sense!\nLeads to:\n\"Yeah! Wasn't she supposed to be the \"landscape painter in sound\" or something?\"\nPresent anything else\nApollo:\nJudge:\nWhat... is that supposed to mean? I don't see how it relates to the defendant's vision or lack thereof.\nApollo:\nWell, see, it... (...is the wrong piece of evidence.)\nJudge:\nI do see how your lack of an answer relates to this penalty, however!\nKlavier:\nAh ha ha ha. Herr Forehead, I'm disappointed in you. Unless you're merely \"feigning\" stupidity? Ja?\nApollo:\n(Keep it up wise guy...)\nKlavier:\nRecall the relationship of Lamiroir and Machi Tobaye. In particular, their arrangement over the years before visiting our country.\nEma:\nLamiroir and her pianist... They would always walk together, she leading him by the hand. Even when they got on stage, she would lead him to the piano. She would walk all the way over there with him!\nKlavier:\nThat's right. Because he was \"blind\". Or so we thought... She led him at all times. All times.\nJudge:\nAll times... Hmm.\nKlavier:\nYet we now know that Machi could see perfectly well. Why keep up the charade?\nJudge:\nWell, wasn't it part of their, er, performance?\nKlavier:\nThere is a simpler explanation, Herr Judge. Machi did not need to be led by the hand at all. Which means...\nApollo:\nAaaaah! You don't mean---!?\nKlavier:\nI do. It was the other way around! The one who needed to be led by the hand... ...was Lamiroir!\nJudge:\nWh-What's this...?\nJudge:\nS-So you mean to say that Lamiroir is... she's...\nKlavier:\nBlind as a bat, Herr Judge.\nEma:\nWha... Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order!!! This is crazy, Prosecutor Gavin!\nLeads to:\n\"Yeah! Wasn't she supposed to be the \"landscape painter in sound\" or something?\"\nI haven't a clue\nApollo:\n...... (I have no idea!)\nKlavier:\nAh ha ha ha. Herr Forehead, I'm disappointed in you. Unless you're merely \"feigning\" stupidity? Ja?\nApollo:\n(Keep it up wise guy...)\nKlavier:\nRecall the relationship of Lamiroir and Machi Tobaye.

Wasn't she supposed to be the \"landscape painter in sound\" or something?\nKlavier:\nWell, since we have her here...\nEma:\n!\nKlavier:\n...Why not ask Lamiroir herself? I believe she is still in the witness waiting room.\nTrucy:\nA-Apollo, what does this mean for our case!?\nApollo:\nDon't ask me! I had no idea she couldn't see... I hadn't even imagined it until now!\nJudge:\nBailiff! Bring in Lamiroir!\nKlavier:\n...Lamiroir. It pains me deeply to call you before us again in this way. And yet I must.\nLamiroir:\nPlease, do not be concerned on my behalf.\nApollo:\n(Those eyes... She really can't see? Really?)\nLamiroir:\n...... It is true.\nApollo:\n...!\nLamiroir:\nHow funny it is that a tiny lie born in the Borginian countryside... ...would one day grow to entangle the entire world.\nJudge:\nSo... So you are...!?\nLamiroir:\nYes. As I mentioned before... ...I have no memory of the time before I became Lamiroir. Know too that my memories begin in darkness. The word \"light\" has no meaning for Lamiroir.\nJudge:\nI see...\nKlavier:\nYou may recall me saying something toward the beginning of this trial, Herr Forehead.\nApollo:\n...? What's that?\nKlavier:\nI believe I said it was unfortunate this crime had no \"direct\" witnesses.\nApollo:\nAh...\nKlavier:\nNow, Lamiroir, I must ask you to stand once more. Will you testify to the court about your eyes?\nLamiroir:\nOf course. It was never my intent to deceive any of you. May I begin, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nUh, yes, yes of course... Though I admit, I'm a little lost here.\nApollo:\nI think we're all a bit lost here, Your Honor.\nWitness Testimony\n-- Lamiroir's Eyes --\nLamiroir:\nI have no memory of the \"light\".\nI debuted in a world of darkness and sound...\nMy producer came up with my PR line before he knew this.\nSo, silly as it may sound, I had to pretend I could see.\nEveryone on my staff knew, of course, but no others.\nJudge:\nBut... this is a murder trial!\nLamiroir:\nI apologize. It was part of my contract, you see. I was to keep my blindness a secret, no matter what. Music is everything for me. I never imagined something like this would...\nKlavier:\nShe told us the truth in the beginning. When she said she \"saw nothing\".\nJudge:\nVery well. Does the defense have anything to add?\nApollo:\n...... I'd like to cross-examine.\nTrucy:\nBut, what is there left to ask!?\nApollo:\nThere was one thing in her testimony that bothered me.\nKlavier:\nPerhaps it is best we let you get it out of your system. Someday you'll come to understand... ...the importance of thinking for yourself.\nJudge:\nVery well. The defense may proceed. However... Be aware this court will not tolerate any questions deemed too stressful to the witness.\nApollo:\n...OK. (There was only one part that bothered me... Just let me ask about that and I'll be happy.)\nCross Examination\n-- Lamiroir's Eyes --\nLamiroir:\nI have no memory of the \"light\".\nPress\nApollo:\nApollo:\nSo, you don't know why you went blind?\nLamiroir:\n...I do not. I may have been born this way, in fact.\nKlavier:\n...It's fruitless to attempt to pry into her past. And, I might add, it's a delicate subject.\nJudge:\nI'm not sure we can reasonably expect Mr. Justice to do anything delicately.\nApollo:\n(Hey! Why I oughta... take a deep breath and calm down.)\nLamiroir:\nWhat I am now is all that I have. It is enough, I think.\nLamiroir:\nI debuted in a world of darkness and sound...\nPress\nApollo:\nApollo:\nWeren't you nervous to hit the stage in your condition?\nLamiroir:\nNo, not at all, surprisingly. It felt natural, singing in front of everyone.\nJudge:\nIt's not something just anyone can do.\nKlavier:\nShe has talent, that much is quite clear. You might even say she is beloved by the gods of music.\nLamiroir:\nEven without light, I live perfectly happy in my world of sound. If that is a talent, as you say, then I thank the gods responsible.\nApollo:\nWhat about your PR motto?\nLamiroir:\nMy producer came up with my PR line before he knew this.\nPress\nApollo:\nApollo:\nPerhaps your music reminded him of the Borginian scenery?\nLamiroir:\nAh ha ha. No, it was quite the opposite.\nApollo:\nThe opposite?\nLamiroir:\nAccording to my producer... ...my music has a certain \"global\" quality.\nJudge:\nGlobal?\nLamiroir:\nMulticultural, if you will. Hard to pin to one region. When people listen to it, they picture the country closest to their hearts. Which is why my music has reached so many.\nTrucy:\nWhat a lovely story!\nKlavier:\nIt sounds like this producer might have known what he was doing after all.\nLamiroir:\nMy songs are nothing more than a white canvas. To me, the real landscape painter [sic] are the listeners. When I think of that, I do not mind how I am represented to the world so much. Yet, one thing quickly led to another...\nLamiroir:\nSo, silly as it may sound, I had to pretend I could see.\nPress\nApollo:\nApollo:\nWas that to protect your image as the \"landscape painter in sound\"?\nLamiroir:\nThat does not matter so much to me, really. But the label is quite concerned about it, I think.\nTrucy:\nA landscape painter who can't see... that's like a pianist who can't play, huh.\nApollo:\nI'm not sure you can compare your father to Lamiroir.\nLamiroir:\nThe world of commercial music is filled with these little white lies. Nothing is sacred when it comes to publicity...\nLamiroir:\nEveryone on my staff knew, of course, but no others.\nPress\nApollo:\nLeads to:\n\"When you say your staff, do you include Mr. LeTouse?\"\nApollo:\n(I suppose that's her confession, of sorts. There's just one part that bothers me... ...And I'm going to get to the bottom of it.)\nApollo:\nWhen you say your staff, do you include Mr. LeTouse?\nLamiroir:\nOf course. He was my manager.\nApollo:\n(So he knew... and that's what's been bugging me!)\nJudge:\nSomething the matter, Mr. Justice?\nKlavier:\nI believe I know what is bothering our young defense attorney. ...You are thinking of when you discovered the body, yes?\nApollo:\n...!\nTrucy:\nIs he right, Apollo?\nApollo:\n...Yes, I was.\nLeTouse:\n......Nnnh......\nApollo:\n...! (He... He's alive!) Mr. LeTouse! Can you hear me!?\nLeTouse:\n...Cold... so cold... Witness...\nApollo:\nYou're cold? D-Don't worry, you're going to be fine! Help is on the way!\nLeTouse:\n...Can't s...see...\nApollo:\nHang in there, Mr. LeTouse! Tell me, who was the witness?\nLeTouse:\nThe wi...witness...is ...si...si...ren...\nApollo:\nMr. LeTouse told me to ask the witness, and he named you.\nLamiroir:\n...!\nApollo:\nWhy would he do that? He knew you were blind!\nLamiroir:\nI... I don't know...\nKlavier:\nTsk, tsk.\nApollo:\n...!\nKlavier:\nWhat did I just say? You need to learn to think for yourself.\nApollo:\nMeaning what...?\nKlavier:\nThere is no mystery here if you recall everything he said. Think of his last words once more.\nJudge:\n\"The witness... siren\"? We've heard them many times. Along with a little play-acting by our defense.\nKlavier:\nI remember them well myself, but that statement is not to what I refer. I mean what he said before that.\nApollo:\n...Before? (What came before that...?) Ack!\nKlavier:\n...That's right. He tried to tell you. When he said \"can't see\" he wasn't talking about himself. He was talking about the witness!\nJudge:\nI see!\nKlavier:\nToo bad the defense did not. Well, Herr Forehead? Try relaxing and \"looking\" at the facts first next time.\nApollo:\n...Urk!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order!\nKlavier:\nRecall Lamiroir's earlier testimony...\nLamiroir:\nI was on my way from the stage to the backstage exit. There were two shots... I couldn't do anything to stop it.\nJudge:\nBut she couldn't have heard those gunshots! I thought we proved that...\nKlavier:\nThat is not the most important point here.\nJudge:\nHmm?\nKlavier:\nThe moment he was shot, Mr. LeTouse \"witnessed\" her through that window. ...Why else would he have named her as the witness?\nApollo:\nAh...\nLamiroir:\nBut I really did hear them! Two gunshots... and the man's voice!\nKlavier:\nUnfortunately, such a thing was impossible. The window was closed. We have already run a simulation, of course.\nLamiroir:\nBut it was so clear... If I heard that voice again, I would know it in an instant...\nJudge:\nHmm...\nBailiff:\n...Your Honor!\nJudge:\nWhat is it, Bailiff? Can't you see we're in session here!?\nBailiff:\nWe have the results back from the investigation!\nJudge:\nThe investigation...?\nKlavier:\nAh, the Interpol number that Mr. LeTouse left us.\nJudge:\n...! Well let's hear it! ...We will continue this cross-examination afterward. Detective Crescend! Your report please!\nDaryan:\nI asked Interpol about that number. I'm sure you'll find their answer intriguing.\nKlavier:\n...Quick work as always, Daryan.\nJudge:\nWell, tell us about the number! Is the defendant a secret agent!?\nDaryan:\n\"IPXX314206\"... The agent registered under that number... ...was Romein LeTouse.\nKlavier:\nWhat...?\nDaryan:\nOur undercover Interpol agent was Mr. LeTouse himself! He was apparently in the middle of an operation.\nApollo:\nSo, when he wrote those letters...\nDaryan:\n...He was trying to tell us his own identity. And a cautious killer tried to wipe them away.\nTrucy:\nMr. LeTouse was an undercover Interpol agent... So him being Lamiroir's manager...\nApollo:\n...Was just a cover, most likely.\nDaryan:\nThere's one other important detail I found.\nKlavier:\nWell, out with it.\nDaryan:\nIt concerns that 45-caliber revolver, the murder weapon. Apparently, it belonged to Romein LeTouse. He had an Interpol permit to carry firearms. ...And the registration number on the revolver matched.\nKlavier:\nSo the victim was killed with his own weapon, which makes sense. It's hard to imagine someone who wasn't an Interpol agent with such a large revolver.\nApollo:\n(So the victim was an Interpol agent on an undercover op... I wonder how that ties into everything.)\nTrucy:\nIt's got to tie in somehow, you'd think.\nApollo:\nYeah, somehow...\nJudge:\nThanks for looking into that for us, Detective Crescend. It's a great help.\nDaryan:\nOh, no problem at all, Your Honor. ...I'll be heading out...\n???:\nLamiroir:\nWait!\nJudge:\nLa-Lamiroir! Is something the matter?\nLamiroir:\nThat voice just now...\nKlavier:\nDaryan?\nLamiroir:\nMr. Daryan, is it...? ............ It was him. I am sure of it.\nJudge:\nIt was \"him\"?\nKlavier:\nY-You aren't saying--!?\nLamiroir:\nThat voice I heard, talking to Mr. LeTouse... when I heard the gunshots fired. It was him! It was Mr. Daryan!\nKlavier:\nIs this some kind of a joke!?\nApollo:\nWhaaaaaaaat!?\nDaryan:\n...No way...\nApollo:\n(The courtroom fell into such a chaotic state, the trial had to be suspended temporarily. I'd never seen that happen before. Of course, it's not every day that you get an accusation like that one. Lamiroir, fingering Daryan Crescend. Not only is he a guitarist, he's a detective! Could it really have been his voice Lamiroir heard? Things were changing fast, and frankly, I wasn't sure I could keep up with it.)\nTrucy:\nHey! No wimping out now, Apollo!\nTo be continued.\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nApollo:\nApollo:\nYour Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?\nJudge:\nUh... I'm not sure I follow you.\nApollo:\nIt clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...\nJudge:\n...You don't sound very sure, Mr. Justice. Objection overruled.\nApollo:\n(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nApollo:\nApollo:\nThis evidence clearly reveals a contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nHow exactly are the evidence and the statement just now related?\nApollo:\nThey aren't, are they...?\nJudge:\nNot at all. Mr. Justice, please think the facts over before making accusations.\nApollo:\n(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)\nPresenting wrong evidence during testimony\nApollo:\nApollo:\nYour Honor! That statement contradicts the evidence!\nJudge:\n...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...\nApollo:\n...Um... You sure about that?\nJudge:\nObjection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Justice!\nApollo:\n(Ack! That didn't go so well.)\nPerceive wrong area (during cross-examination segment \"What I Saw\")\nApollo:\nApollo:\nYou may have seen the world, but I've seen your heart. You were flustered during your testimony just now!\nLamiroir:\n...... I do not understand what it is you are saying. Perhaps this is a joke, in your culture?\nTrucy:\nShe doesn't seem very flustered to me, Apollo.\nApollo:\n(Hmm. Maybe I got that one wrong. I have to look harder! I'll find that weak spot!)\nToo many penalties\nJudge:\nThat's enough! I see no need to further prolong this trial. The defense's case is insufficient to overturn the prosecution's claims! This court finds the defendant, Machi Tobaye...\nGuilty\nJudge:\nThe defendant will surrender himself to the court's care... ...to undergo a regular trial at the High Court within a month's time. Court is adjourned!\nTurnabout Serenade\nTranscript\nPart 1\nPart 2\nPart 3\nPart 4\nJuly 9, 2:12 PMWright Anything Agency\nTrucy:\nHey, hey, Apollo!\nApollo:\nWhat?\nTrucy:\nUm, well, you know... ...Um, actually, nothing. I mean, something. ...Or maybe not.\nApollo:\nOut with it. The suspense is giving me an ulcer.\nTrucy:\nWell, you know, the trial today? I was thinking... If you gave it a score, what score would you give it?\nApollo:\nScore? Um, gee... I guess I would... um, or maybe... well... ...Bah. I'm just as bad as you.\nTrucy:\nSee? It's so... so vague!\nApollo:\nClearly. Machi avoided a guilty verdict, which is something. Though I can't say I'm any less confused about the case.\nDaryan:\nI asked Interpol about that number. I'm sure you'll find their answer intriguing. \"IPXX314206\"... The agent registered under that number... ...was Romein LeTouse.\nApollo:\nAnd the victim, Mr. LeTouse... Who would have guessed he was actually an undercover Interpol agent!? ...What a mess. And we don't have any idea what he was investigating.\nTrucy:\nWell, true, but we know who shot him now! Lamiroir told the whole court!\nLamiroir:\nWait! That voice just now... ............ It was him. I am sure of it. That voice I heard, talking to Mr. LeTouse... when I heard the gunshots fired. It was him! It was Mr. Daryan!\nTrucy:\nIt's another mystery, Apollo! I love mysteries.\nApollo:\nI don't. Speaking of mysteries, what's Mr. Wright up to? I wouldn't mind asking his opinion.\nTrucy:\nNow that you mention it, I haven't seen Daddy around.\nApollo:\nWhat, is he some kind of stray that just wanders in and out at will?\nTrucy:\nI wouldn't say that, but he has been going out a lot. Some \"top-secret mission\", he said.\nApollo:\nTop secret...?\nTrucy:\nAnyway, you can't just rely on him to save the day! And you've got me to help you. We'll be fine!\nApollo:\nFine... right. Well, time's a-wasting, as they say. Let's investigate.\nTrucy:\nThat's the spirit!\nExamine\nBookshelf\nApollo:\nThere are several books of magic mixed in with the legal books on the shelves. I dusted them recently. Nothing like the gleam of clean books!\nCharley the plant\nApollo:\nMr. Charley, the potted plant. Huh? His leaves are looking a little... brown.\nTrucy:\nGood morning, Mr. Charley! Ack! M-Mr. Charley! Your leaves!\nApollo:\nMaybe you weren't giving him enough water?\nTrucy:\nNo, no, it must be stress. He's worried about the new recruit at the office.\nApollo:\nHey, don't blame it on me! You are watering him, right?\nTrucy:\nIt was Daddy's turn to water him this week... Ack!\nApollo:\nMr. Wright has been away on his \"top secret mission\", no?\nTrucy:\nI'm sorry Mr. Charley, this is all my fault. I'll water you soon, promise!\nHula hoop\nApollo:\nYou know, that ring kind of gets in the way. Our client the other day tripped on it and fell on the floor.\nTrucy:\n...Sending my ring rolling out the door! You know how long it took me to find it?\nApollo:\nYou know how long it took to calm down the client? And in the end, they walked out without hiring us. Could you clean up a bit?\nTrucy:\nBut don't you think the props give the office a festive, fun-filled mood?\nApollo:\nI'm not sure law offices have to be festive and fun-filled.\nTrucy:\nApollo! This is the \"Wright Anything Agency\"! As CEO, I want an office that says we know how to have fun!\nApollo:\n(I guess it is her office... isn't it?)\nMagic split box\nApollo:\nA strange, split box leers at me from the wall. No matter how many times I see that there, it still strikes me as... odd.\nTrucy:\nReally? I guess I've gotten used to it, after growing up with it always around the house.\nApollo:\nWhat kind of a home did you grow up in!?\nTrucy:\nI'd hide in there when we played hide 'n' seek! You just get in, slide the sections around, and you're impossible to find!\nApollo:\nI bet you would be...\nPhotograph\nApollo:\nA faded photograph showing one of Trucy's favorite magicians. She talks to it daily for good luck, I hear.\nTrucy:\nAck! I almost forgot! Umm... I hope I become a famous Grand Magician! Oh, and I hope Apollo becomes an Ace Attorney! ...There! All done.\nApollo:\n(I suppose if you're going to talk to inanimate objects, a photo isn't so bad.)\nPiano\nApollo:\nHow is your magic act coming along?\nTrucy:\nWell, I've been working on my \"cups & balls\" routine.\nApollo:\nIs that the one where the ball moves from under one cup to the other?\nTrucy:\nThat's right! The very same! Here, watch... First, I put one of the cups over the ball... then I snap my fingers! Ta da! The ball's under the other cup!\nApollo:\n...It's not there.\nTrucy:\n...... ...Watch me pull something out of my magic panties!\nApollo:\nNice try.\nTrucy:\nGuess I know what I'll be doing tonight. Practicing! You can be my audience, Apollo!\nApollo:\n(*sigh*)\nSilk hat\nApollo:\nThat's one of those hats you pull things out of, right?\nTrucy:\nOf course! My hat's like a little universe! Bigger on the inside than on the outside!\nApollo:\nHmm... That reminds me of a sci-fi show I used to watch.\nTrucy:\nIncidentally, my pocket is a little universe, too! And my panties, and...\nApollo:\nI get the idea.\nSpaghetti\nApollo:\nI've seen some restaurants that set out real food to show what's on the menu.\nTrucy:\nI have, too! But I noticed something strange... One time, there was a sandwich without any lettuce! Like it had disappeared... by magic!\nApollo:\n...I'm sure someone just swiped the lettuce and ate it.\nTrucy:\nWait, that sandwich... You didn't...! Apollo, you shouldn't eat sample food, no matter how hungry you are!\nApollo:\nJust how hard up do you think I am!?\nTable\nTrucy:\nWell, how about some tea? Here you go!\nApollo:\nUm, thanks. That's nice. ...But this is not the time to be drinking tea!\nTrucy:\nThat's right, we have to get investigating! Ack, that was a close call! We almost relaxed!\nTalk\nDaryan did it\nApollo:\nLamiroir dropped a bomb in court today... \"It was Daryan\"...\nTrucy:\nLamiroir said she's never forgotten a voice, right? That's so cool!\nApollo:\nUm, I guess.\nTrucy:\nWhat's that called again? Um... Elephant ears...? I bet that's what they're called...\nApollo:\n...Somehow I don't think that means what you think it means. ...And she has to be wrong, this time.\nTrucy:\nWrong? Why?\nApollo:\nI mean, look... Those gunshots were right during the concert!\nTrucy:\nThat's right! I was burning up the dance floor at the time.\nApollo:\nRight... Did you happen to look up on stage? Maybe... at Daryan, even?\nTrucy:\nYou bet I did! He is one of the Gavinners's guitarists after all! He's so cool! ...Oh.\nApollo:\nRight. All the Gavinners have a rock-solid alibi. He couldn't have shot Mr. LeTouse backstage.\nTrucy:\nBut... Lamiroir heard him, didn't she? She heard Daryan backstage... Right...?\nApollo:\n(Somebody's either wrong, or lying very badly here...)\nAgent LeTouse\nApollo:\nAn Interpol agent... hmm.\nTrucy:\nI was wondering, what is \"Interpol\" anyway?\nApollo:\nHuh? Interpol? They're the guys who catch international criminals.\nTrucy:\nWhy can't they just call them \"International Police\" instead of making up some silly name?\nApollo:\nYeah... ...Anyway, you think he was investigating Lamiroir?\nTrucy:\nWhaaaa--!? Why would anyone do that? She's not a criminal! She couldn't be!\nApollo:\nDon't be fooled by appearances is all I'm saying.\nTrucy:\nBut remember I'm a magician, Apollo! I can spot a palmed coin at fifty paces!\nApollo:\nIf only it were that easy. ...In any case, we know he was working on something.\nTrucy:\nI wonder if it was something that has something to do with something. That something being our case. The last something, I mean.\nApollo:\nSomething like that. ...Frankly, the whole thing is making my head hurt. (What was Mr. LeTouse up to?)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nTrucy:\nThat again? You sure like your attorney's badge. Still, I'm afraid our clients are getting tired of it...\nApollo:\n...Well I'm not. So there.\nAnything else\nTrucy:\nI'm not sure about that, sorry. I was ripping up the dance floor at the time of the shooting, after all.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\n???:\nAhhh ha ha ha ha haa!\nApollo:\n......\nTrucy:\n......\nApollo:\nUm, Trucy? Was that another one of your tricks?\nTrucy:\nIt wasn't me! I can't even make Mr. Hat laugh like that!\n???:\n...Wherever the mundane gives way to miracles, a word is whispered... Gramarye!\nTrucy:\nHey! The other day...\nTrucy:\nEeeeeeeeeeeeek!\nApollo:\nWho's there!?\nTrucy:\nWe... didn't just imagine that, did we?\nApollo:\nHe was wearing a silk hat. ...Friend of yours?\nTrucy:\nHardly!\n???:\nWe meet again!\nApollo:\nAh, um, nice to meet you. Who... are you? (And could you please stop smirking like that?)\nTrucy:\nAh. Ahhhhhhh! It's you!!! Uncle Valant!\nApollo:\nUncle Valant...? He's your uncle!?\nTrucy:\nNo, silly! It's the Great Gramarye, Valant Gramarye! The Grand Magician!\nValant:\nYes, it is I, the Great Valant Gramarye. As seen on television.\nApollo:\n(And could you please stop smirking like that?)\nValant:\nIt's been a while, Miss Trucy. Seven years to be exact! My, how you've grown!\nTrucy:\nGood to see you again, Uncle Valant! You... look exactly the same!\nApollo:\nUm, I hate to intrude, but... What is a Great Magician doing paying us a visit?\nValant:\nI believe it was you who wished to see me? So, be quick with your questions! And do not quail, quake, or quiver. I am quite tame. Though my stardom may sear the sight... I'm quite down to earth when need calls.\nApollo:\n(He does have a certain aura to him, it's true.)\nTrucy:\nLet's ask him about the case, Apollo!\nApollo:\n(His \"aura\" sure isn't lost on our magician-in-the-making. She's practically drooling with enthusiasm.)\nTrucy:\nAfter all... ...Uncle Valant's one of Daddy's best friends! That's why I call him \"uncle\".\nApollo:\nWh-What? Daddy... you mean Mr. Wright...?\nTrucy:\nNo, I mean... My real Daddy.\nApollo:\n...! (Trucy's real father!?)\nTalk\nTroupe Gramarye\nTrucy:\nWait, Apollo... Don't tell me you don't know about Troupe Gramarye?\nApollo:\nTroupe \"Gram-uh-ree\"... huh? No. (Changed form [Troupe Grammarie... huh? No.] in the original release) But it does sound kind of familiar...\nValant:\nOh, lost life! Lamentably listless lad! To not know of the greatest troupe of magicians on the planet!\nApollo:\n(Valant Gramarye... The name began to surface in my mind. It was a name I'd heard on television as a child.)\nTrucy:\nYou bet you've heard the name! He made a cruise ship disappear, and blew up an amusement park... ...Oh, and he made all this gold disappear from a safe! And then escaped from a high security prison!\nApollo:\nUm... ...You said he is a magician?\nValant:\nI open the locks to hearts chained... by mediocrity. This is the true miracle of Troupe Gramarye.\nApollo:\n...Wait.\nTrucy:\nWhat, Apollo?\nApollo:\nI do remember... seeing you on television... a long time ago. Weren't you with someone else...? Like, a duo?\nTrucy:\nA duo?\nApollo:\nYeah, you had a partner. \"Something Gramarye\"...\nValant:\nYes... Zak. Zak Gramarye. A masterful maker of magic, a capable crafter of shining showmanship!\nTrucy:\n......\nApollo:\n? Why's everyone so quiet?\nTrucy:\nDaddy...\nApollo:\nDaddy...? (Huh!? Oh, no way!)\nTrucy's father\nValant:\nOnce upon a time, the Troupe Gramarye included two Grand Magicians. Myself, Valant Gramarye, and my partner... Zak Gramarye!\nApollo:\nAnd this Zak was...?\nTrucy:\nHe was my real Daddy.\nApollo:\n(Trucy's father, a magician... I guess it makes sense.) ...I had no idea.\nTrucy:\nThere wasn't much point in talking about it... Not now that he's gone.\nApollo:\n...Oh, I'm sorry.\nTrucy:\nNo, it's OK. I'm not lonely. I've got my Daddy, after all! And you make me laugh, Apollo.\nApollo:\nGlad that I'm good for comic relief, at least.\nTrucy:\n...Not that I see Daddy around much these days.\nPresent\nAnything\nValant:\nWhat's this? You would ask me for a miracle? Free of fee? Then thy wish be granted! Thy will be done! Thy evidence evicted into the ether!\nApollo:\nAck! No evicting, please! (...Are all magicians like this, I wonder?)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nValant:\n...Ach, I've been remiss in remembering my reasons for my visit.\nApollo:\nReasons?\nValant:\nTwo, in fact! The first being, of course... ...to see you, Miss Trucy.\nTrucy:\nYou don't know how happy I am to see you again, Uncle Valant!\nValant:\nI'm sure you are.\nApollo:\n...Not one for modesty, are you?\nValant:\nWhen I encountered you at the Coliseum... the first time in seven years... ...I could fain not contain my emotions! I wept oceans! (Chagned from [...I could fain contain my emotions! I wept oceans!] in the original release) And to learn you now defend that poor pianist, that blinded boy! 'Twas a hot topic of talk amongst the staff, you know. And defend him you did!\nTrucy:\nEh heh. Well, it wasn't all my doing.\nApollo:\nUm, I'm his defense attorney, actually.\nValant:\nMy other reason for coming here today... was this.\nTrucy:\nThat's... a video tape?\nValant:\nQuite so. A recording of the concert, no less. I've brought it for you, Trucy, on behalf of Troupe Gramarye. Will you watch it?\nSugar, Sugar...O that night, in your embrace.\nWhen you stole away the keysmy heart held on to so tight.\nPleasure...But a fleeting melody\nIt wraps itself around me,And now through the air I fly.\nWoh... Woh...\nBurning on in my heart. Fire.Burn my love away. All away.\nLike a bullet of love. Fire.Take my life away. All away.\nGuitar, Guitar...Up together to the sky.\nTrucy:\nWow... It's almost as good as it was live. So... what's the word? Mysterious...\nApollo:\n(There are more mysterious things than her song going on... Way more mysterious...)\nValant:\nAh ha ha ha ha...!\nApollo:\n(This Valant Gramarye has good reasons to be here today... But I wonder what his \"reasons\" were to be at that concert?)\nVideo Tape received from Valant.\nPresent\nVideo Tape\nLeads to:\n\"So, I was wondering... That stunt in the middle of the song there...\"\nApollo:\nSo, I was wondering... That stunt in the middle of the song there...\nTrucy:\nI didn't see a stunt...\nApollo:\nWhat about Lamiroir vanishing and reappearing!?\nTrucy:\nOh, that? I guess I'm so used to seeing that happen I didn't even notice.\nApollo:\n(So young to be so jaded...)\nValant:\nA simple sleight-of-hand, a petite prestidigitation. (Changed from [A simple slight-of-hand [sic], a petit prestidigitation.] in the original release) A modicum of magic from me... to you.\nTrucy:\nSo that's why you were at the concert!\nValant:\nYes. I was there to watch my trick take to the air...\nApollo:\nSo you're the one who knows how it was all done.\nValant:\nOf course. I am like a deity, with the stage as my domain! I suffer no mystery upon those floodlit boards not grasped tightly 'twixt my fingers. It is a potent, primeval power I possess.\nApollo:\nUm... Well... Do you think you could... ...tell me how it was done!?\nTrucy:\nHey now!\nApollo:\nTrucy...?\nTrucy:\nThat's like, totally against the rules, Apollo!\nApollo:\nNot during a murder investigation, it's not!\nValant:\nMais non, for my illusions are mine alone, m'sieur. Also...\nApollo:\nAlso what?\nValant:\nRecall that the terrible occurrence happened later. Well after my illusion entranced the audience.\nApollo:\nOh.\nValant:\nDon't even ask. I won't answer.\nTrucy:\nToo bad for you, Apollo!\nApollo:\n(Grr. Whose side are you on?)\nValant:\n...I, Valant Gramarye, now make my leave, Miss Trucy.\nTrucy:\nThere's no need to rush, Uncle Valant! You should stay a while!\nValant:\nI am afraid I cannot. I may not. I shall not. I have been asked to assist with an analysis and so I shall slink back to the scene.\nApollo:\nSo... you'll be at the concert venue today?\nValant:\nCorrect. If you would call on me, come to the Coliseum! See you later, crocodile.\nApollo:\n(With a whir of his cloak, and a wink of his eye... ...he turned and walked out through the door. Normally.)\nTrucy:\nWell, there you go, Apollo! Let's get cracking!\nApollo:\n...Right. (Valant Gramarye... I've got a few more things to ask him. Foremost among them, that bit of magic that made Lamiroir disappear... ...And how he knows Trucy, and her \"real\" father...!)\nExamine\nPhotograph\nApollo:\nSo this photo is of your father, Trucy?\nTrucy:\nSomeday, I'll be as good a magician as Zak Gramarye! You'll see!\nApollo:\n(No wonder she's so devoted to her art...)\nTrucy:\nYou should have seen him on stage, Apollo! He made things disappear right and left! Poof poof poof! Until he even made himself disappear! Cool, huh?\nApollo:\nUh, yeah... (Is that how it really happened?)\nJuly 9Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nApollo:\n(Machi may not be guilty, but he's still a suspect.)\nTrucy:\nBut they don't have any decisive evidence!\nApollo:\nYeah, but only someone as small as him could have gotten out of that room.\nTrucy:\nRight... the air vent.\nApollo:\nAnd... he lied.\nTrucy:\nLied?\nApollo:\n(Machi Tobaye can see...)\nMachi:\n....................\nTrucy:\nAh! Machi!\nApollo:\nSpeak of the devil.\nMachi:\n....................\nTrucy:\nHe looks like he's doing OK!\nApollo:\nI forget. Why did we come here? It's not like we can talk to him or anything.\nTrucy:\nWords are overrated! Feelings are what matter, Apollo.\nApollo:\nIt's kinda hard to build a court case on feelings. But, since we're here, anyway. Might as well get what I want to say off my chest.\nTrucy:\nIf you need someone to complain to, I'll listen...\nApollo:\n(I think she's actually worried for me...)\nMachi:\n.....................\nExamine\nSecurity camera\nApollo:\nThat security camera is looking at me. Why do I feel this sudden urge to make a silly face?\nSecurity guard\nApollo:\nA security guard. He stands here, watching this room. His eyes when he looks at Machi are gentle. Maybe he has a kid the same age.\nTalk\nThe trial today\nTrucy:\nSo, what did you think of the trial today?\nMachi:\n.....................\nTrucy:\n...Whew. I'm glad he doesn't understand English after all. If he did, he would have been scared out of his mind by that trial.\nApollo:\nHey, all's well that ends well. You have to be more goal-oriented. If he's innocent, we win. (Changed from [You have to be more goal oriented. If he's not guilty, we win.] in the original release)\nTrucy:\nNo, if he's found \"not guilty\", we win. (Changed from [No, if he's innocent, we win.] in the original release) Machi might not understand English, but I bet he gets that better than you do.\nMachi:\n.....................\nApollo:\n...! (Huh...?)\nLamiroir's testimony\nTrucy:\nI'm glad Lamiroir testified! What a great person. She even got Machi off the hook by naming another suspect!\nApollo:\nDaryan of the Gavinners... The detective. I wonder if Machi knows what happened?\nTrucy:\n?\nApollo:\nI mean, if he could follow how the trial went at all. If no one told him there's a new suspect, how would he know? Hey...\nTrucy:\nWhat is it, Apollo?\nApollo:\nNo... It's nothing.\nMachi:\n.....................\nMachi's eyesight\nTrucy:\nSo, Machi... You can see, right?\nMachi:\n........................\nTrucy:\nMachi can see, and Lamiroir can't... The whole world's gone topsy-turvy!\nMachi:\n........................\nTrucy:\nSorry, Apollo. I don't think we're going to get any information out of Machi. ...Which makes sense.\nApollo:\n(...Yeah, I guess it does...)\nPresent\nAnything\nMachi:\n[Foreign text]...\nTrucy:\nI think he said... \"I am sorry I cannot speak your language. You are very beautiful, fair maiden.\"\nApollo:\n...This is why I never trust a translator.\nAfter clearing \"The trial today\" and \"Lamiroir's testimony\" Talk options:\nApollo:\n...I must be imagining it.\nTrucy:\nImagining what, Apollo?\nApollo:\nIt's just, I couldn't help but feel that... I dunno. Machi... ...He doesn't understand what we're saying, right?\nTrucy:\nHow could he? He's a young Borginian! He doesn't speak English.\nApollo:\nYeah, but my bracelet is reacting to him.\nTrucy:\nHuh? Maybe it's malfunctioning? Or it's scared, because you keep making those \"I'm so mad\" faces.\nApollo:\nWas I that bad? (Machi lied about not being able to see... But what if that's not all he lied about?)\nTrucy:\nIf you're curious about it there's only one thing to do. You should ask him.\nApollo:\n(I think it'll take something big to get to him... Some kind of undeniable evidence.) ...We'll be back, Machi.\nMachi:\n........................\nJuly 9Sunshine Coliseum\nTrucy:\nWoo! What a great day! It's perfect weather for sleuthing!\nApollo:\nThe weather matters for an investigation?\nTrucy:\nDon't some days just feel like \"magic\" days or \"defense\" days?\nApollo:\nUm, sure. Let's get started, shall we?\nTrucy:\nRight on! Show us your stuff, Apollo!\nApollo:\nUm, what stuff?\nTrucy:\nYour voice training! This is the perfect place for it!\nApollo:\nI did enough at home, thanks.\nTrucy:\nAw, there's no need to be shy! Keep that up and you'll never make it on the big stage!\nApollo:\nI'm happy in the courtroom, thank you. I am a lawyer.\nTrucy:\nThen you're in luck, because it's lawyer weather today! Don't you just want to face the blue sky and shout, \"Objection!\"?\nApollo:\nLook, the weather has nothing to do with lawyers. Let's get going already!\nExamine\nBlimp\nTrucy:\nLook! A blimp!\nApollo:\nThose balloons next to it have ad banners on them.\nTrucy:\nLet's see... \"Big Sale, All Shirts 50% Off.\"\nApollo:\nOh. It's an ad for the department store next door.\nBlue Badger\nApollo:\nWhat's that... creature there?\nTrucy:\nOooh! That's the police mascot, the Blue Badger!\nApollo:\nEh? It's life size!\nTrucy:\nHaven't you seen them around town? Patrolling the streets? Yes, now even law and order has a mascot!\nApollo:\n...I'd run from that thing even if I wasn't a criminal. Why does its head wobble like that when it walks? It's freaky.\nTrucy:\nI don't think you're showing true Blue Badger spirit, Apollo.\nColiseum building\nApollo:\nSunshine Coliseum sure is living up to its name today.\nTrucy:\nIt's huge! And Mr. Gavin got to play on that enormous stage... I'm so jealous! Someday, I'll fight my first battle on this stage!\nApollo:\nBattle?\nTrucy:\nWell, yeah, it's a coliseum, isn't it?\nApollo:\nUm, they don't do gladiatorial contests at these places any more, Trucy.\nTrucy:\nReally? I had no idea! I wonder why they stopped.\nApollo:\n(Sometimes I worry about her.)\nSignboard\nApollo:\nLook, a massive sign for the \"Guilty as Charged\" Tour. A giant Prosecutor Gavin stares out over the arena.\nTrucy:\nOoh! Maybe I can take it to the office when they're done with it!\nApollo:\nUm, where would you put it? You couldn't even get that thing through the front door.\nTrucy:\nThen I'll put it outside! I bet it'd be good for business!\nApollo:\nJust as long as no one comes expecting us to prosecute.\nTrucy:\nWell, if anyone comes looking for a concert, leave it to me!\nApollo:\n(Is this part of some twisted plan of hers to make her singing debut, I wonder?)\nJuly 9Backstage Hallway\nLamiroir:\nAh, Mr. Attorney.\nApollo:\nLamiroir! I'm sorry about today... I...\nLamiroir:\nThere is nothing you need to apologize for. You were merely defending Machi.\nTrucy:\nUm... Are you OK? Alone, I mean.\nLamiroir:\nHumans are blessed with five senses. Even robbed of one, we get by. ...Though it does make being a witness rather difficult.\nTrucy:\nSpeaking of \"seeing\", you knew who we were before we spotted you just now. And we weren't even talking.\nLamiroir:\n...I heard your footsteps several times the day before.\nTrucy:\nOh... You must have great ears!\nApollo:\n(Ears that heard the crime taking place... Or so she claimed yesterday. ...But how?)\nExamine\nBlue Badger\nApollo:\nThat would be the Blue Badger, the police mascot. There's a guy outside in a giant Blue Badger costume, lumbering about... He stands out even more than those Gavinners posters.\nTrucy:\nIt's all the same! He's the band mascot, too, you know.\nApollo:\nI can't picture Prosecutor Gavin going for that kind of thing.\nTrucy:\nNeither can I. I'll bet there's a story there just waiting to be told!\nHeadset\nTrucy:\nThat's been lying there since the day before yesterday.\nApollo:\nIt's small. Maybe no one's noticed it.\nTrucy:\nI kinda want to pick it up. It'd make a cool souvenir, don't you think?\nApollo:\n(It does stick out in my mind for some reason...)\n\"Dressing #1\" door\nApollo:\nThat's the Gavinners's dressing room. They're all out on the investigation. Being backstage isn't half as glamorous without a band here.\n\"Dressing #2\" door\nApollo:\nThat's Lamiroir's dressing room... and the scene of the crime. It's kind of lightly guarded for being a crime scene.\nTrucy:\nI'm not complaining! Makes it easier for us to go in! And Ema gave us her OK, right? We can wander in and do as we like!\nApollo:\n(How is Ema doing, anyway...? I hope she's not getting cavities from eating all those chocolate Snackoos...)\nTalk\nThe voice\nApollo:\nThat was quite a statement you made today in court. ...About hearing Daryan Crescend's voice at the scene of the crime.\nLamiroir:\nI did not know his name... ...but I never forget a voice.\nLamiroir:\nWait!\nJudge:\nLa-Lamiroir! Is something the matter?\nLamiroir:\nThat voice just now... ............ It was him. I am sure of it.\nDaryan:\n...No way...\nLamiroir:\n...As I said in court: I was on my way backstage from the stage. That is when I heard his voice.\nApollo:\nI'm guessing Daryan and Mr. LeTouse were talking about something?\nLamiroir:\n...The next moment, I heard those gunshots.\nApollo:\nWhy didn't you call security?\nLamiroir:\nTo be honest, though the noise was quite frightening... ...I never imagined the gunshots might be real. And, I was in quite a hurry myself. I left the scene at once.\nTrucy:\nSo... it really was Daryan's voice that she heard.\nApollo:\nYeah... (At least, she certainly thinks it was.)\nMachi\nLamiroir:\nI met Machi before my debut as Lamiroir... I was singing in a restaurant in Borginia.\nApollo:\nAnd he was playing the piano?\nLamiroir:\n...Yes. He was very kind to me when he learned I could not see.\nApollo:\nIs that when you started playing \"opposites\"? With Machi pretending he couldn't see...\nLamiroir:\nAh, no, it wasn't then. That began after our major debut. ...After I became known as the \"landscape painter in sound\".\nTrucy:\nIt must have been tough for Machi... ...Pretending he couldn't see, and all the while acting as your eyes.\nLamiroir:\nWe held hands always. He would write with his finger on my palm to signal to me thing I should know. He is a smart, gentle boy.\nApollo:\n(I think I see what she's getting at... ...\"Machi would never harm a soul\"...)\nMr. LeTouse\nApollo:\nAbout Mr. LeTouse...\nLamiroir:\nAh yes. He was an Interpol agent, I hear?\nApollo:\nSo, you had no idea?\nLamiroir:\nOf course not. No one did.\nTrucy:\nI guess that's what it means to be undercover.\nApollo:\nBut someone was after him... They had to know who he really was.\nLamiroir:\nWhy did he pose as my manager? I do not understand.\nApollo:\nYou have no idea?\nLamiroir:\nI can only assume that he was investigating me... But why?\nApollo:\nWhat makes you think that?\nLamiroir:\nPerhaps it is not so, but I cannot deny the possibility. Because of my condition... As my present is veiled in darkness, so, too, is my past clouded from my memory.\nApollo:\nClouded... right.\n\"Darkness\" (appears after \"Mr. LeTouse\")\nLamiroir:\nThe darkness that I fear is not the darkness that I see whenever I open my eyes. The real darkness... lies in my heart.\nApollo:\nIn your heart?\nLamiroir:\nI have no memory of the time before I became Lamiroir. I awoke from darkness, into darkness, you might say. I was singing in a restaurant those days.\nApollo:\n(What was it that she said about not being able to remember the light...?)\nLamiroir:\nI do not know my past. Perhaps I committed some terrible crime in my past. Everything before becoming Lamiroir is lost to me.\nTrucy:\nB-But I don't think you...\nLamiroir:\nI can think of no other explanation. Why else would an agent of Interpol approach me?\nApollo:\nDo you think your past might be related to this case?\nTrucy:\nNo way! That seems really unlikely to me. I mean, you're such a sweet person, Lamiroir!\nLamiroir:\n...I thank you. Machi, too, tells me this often when I fear who I might have been.\nPresent\nVideo Tape\nApollo:\nWe took a look at your performance again. It was even better the second time!\nLamiroir:\nThank you.\nTrucy:\nThat reminds me... That was an incredible illusion you pulled off!\nLamiroir:\nIllusion...?\nTrucy:\nWhen you teleported from one stage to the other? Remember?\nLamiroir:\nAh, yes. Apparently, they hired a professional magician.\nApollo:\n(Valant Gramarye...) I was wondering, do you think you could tell us how it was done?\nLamiroir:\n...I'm afraid I cannot. Mr. Gramarye made me swear to never tell a soul.\nApollo:\nI was afraid of that...\nTrucy:\nHard to be a magician if you can't keep a secret, you know?\nAnything else\nApollo:\nDo you think you could tell me about this?\nLamiroir:\nI'm sorry, but my information about the outside world is somewhat limited. I only know what I have heard, or felt.\nApollo:\n(Maybe that explains why she didn't react when I showed her stuff the other day. She was still pretending she could see then...)\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Video Tape:\nLamiroir:\nAh, I am reminded that I wished to speak to you about something.\nApollo:\nYes?\nLamiroir:\nWhen I was walking this hallway before... I stumbled upon a small device of some kind. It was lying on the floor.\nApollo:\nDevice...? Maybe you mean this?\nTrucy:\nThat's been lying there since the day before yesterday!\nLamiroir:\nMight I... touch it? ...... I thought as much.\nApollo:\nWhat? What did you think?\nLamiroir:\nThis is one of our headsets. Everyone on staff wears one during a concert.\nApollo:\nI wonder whose this is?\nLamiroir:\nWe use it for communication. It would be quite inconvenient should it go missing.\nApollo:\nWe'll hold on to it for you then. We'll give it to Prosecutor Gavin when we see him.\nLamiroir:\nYes, that's best. Thank you.\nTrucy:\nSo, can I put it on?\nHeadset attached to Trucy.\nTrucy:\n\"Attached\"? I'm not some kind of robot, Apollo!\nApollo:\n(Everyone on staff was wearing one of these headsets... This might warrant some further inquiry.)\nPresent\nHeadset\nApollo:\nCan I ask you about this headset, Lamiroir? You said that all concert staff were wearing one?\nLamiroir:\nThat's correct. You need them to communicate across such a large stage. Everyone on the staff had one, of course... ...And all of the band members, too, I should think.\nApollo:\n(So Prosecutor Gavin and his lackeys had them on, too, then...)\nLamiroir:\nThey're quite helpful, though limited. They only work within thirty feet or so. After all, they're only for use on stage. And a stronger signal would interfere with the sound system.\nApollo:\nHmm, that makes sense. (You'd think someone would notice if they dropped their only communications lifeline. ...So why was this one lying here?)\nExamine evidence\nHeadset\nReceiver\nTrucy:\n10-4 that, little buddy, this is Trucy reporting in, over. ......\nApollo:\nWhy the sudden silence?\nTrucy:\nNo one answered.\nApollo:\nDon't be silly.\nTrucy:\nWhat good is a receiver that doesn't receive? That's like Ema not performing forensic investigations!\nApollo:\nYou make her sound like she's some kind of forensic investigation machine! Which is just silly. Unless... she's a super hi-tech android that runs on Snackoos! Hmm...\nGavinners's Dressing Room\nExamine\nPostcards\nApollo:\nIt's a stack of Lamiroir's postcards. There it is... The \"landscape painter in sound\"...\nTrucy:\nIt must be hard to pretend you can see when you can't.\nApollo:\nYet the way she sings so effortlessly... you'd think she had life easy. Some people are just impressive like that.\nTrucy:\nYou know it! It just makes me think about how much further I have to go!\nApollo:\n(I hope we can solve this quickly and not add to her troubles...)\nSpeaker\nApollo:\nThe speaker here is the same as the one in Lamiroir's room. I wonder if this one was blaring as loud as hers.\nTrucy:\nI don't see a volume control anywhere in the room... My guess is they give all the rooms equal treatment!\nApollo:\n...You mean equal punishment.\nLamiroir's Dressing Room\nExamine\nAir vent\nApollo:\nThey found Machi Tobaye's fingerprints on that air vent.\nTrucy:\n......\nApollo:\nWhat's with the long face?\nTrucy:\nIt's a little lackluster, you know.\nApollo:\nLackluster...?\nTrucy:\nI mean, using the air vent is so obvious! No audience is going to pay good money to see a trick like that.\nApollo:\n...... Things must look different through a magician's eyes.\nTrucy:\nIt'd be much cooler if the killer got out through that tiny window!\nApollo:\nDon't go there. You'll get your head stuck.\nBrooch\nApollo:\nRight after the shooting took place... ...Lamiroir tried to come into the dressing room, and dropped her brooch.\nTrucy:\nI think that fits with the other stuff we know. Do you think the timing of when she dropped it is important?\nApollo:\nYeah... Something about it bugs me, that's for sure.\nBullet holes\nApollo:\nLook at the way those bullets tore through this thick wall. That revolver really was something else.\nTrucy:\nI wonder if someone as little as me could even fire it?\nApollo:\nDislocating your shoulder would kind of put a crimp on your stage career.\nTrucy:\nDaddy always has stiff shoulders, maybe that could loosen him up!\nApollo:\nDon't even mention it. I'm afraid he might go out and actually try it.\nTrucy:\nNah, he doesn't have the guts to pull the trigger, I bet.\nFruit basket\nTrucy:\nLook! It's fruit! Fruit, Apollo! Fruit!!!\nApollo:\n...I heard you the first time. It sure is a lot of fruit. I doubt anyone would miss a bit of watermelon...\nTrucy:\nI know, I'll make it vanish! Into my stomach!\nApollo:\nBetter not. They might make you pay for it. And if you have the money for that, you should probably repaint the office first.\nTrucy:\nWatermelons are that expensive!?\nApollo:\n*shrug* These could've been imported from some exotic locale, for all we know.\n(Step)ladder\nApollo:\nThe shooter must have used that to climb up to the vent.\nTrucy:\nAll this tragedy, because someone left a stepladder here.\nApollo:\n...I don't think Mr. LeTouse was shot because of the ladder.\nTrucy:\nYou think it was Machi?\nApollo:\nI guess... That air vent is pretty small, after all. (Does that prove he was at the scene...? Did he escape in the time between the gunshots and us opening the door?)\nPoster next to TV\nApollo:\nIt's a poster for another show. \"This Summer: A Legal Eagles Production of 'Case Closed'.\"\nTrucy:\nI looked into that performance group. Turns out they're all law enforcement-related, too. Apparently, their serious portrayal of law and order is a big draw!\nApollo:\n...That sounds so boring, it's probably pretty interesting.\nTrucy:\nYou're a complicated man, Mr. Apollo Justice.\nPoster over TV\nTrucy:\nA Gavinners poster.\nApollo:\nHow many of those did they put up, anyway?\nTrucy:\nProsecutor Gavin looked so cool on stage! You should learn to play the guitar, too, Apollo! You can accompany my magic act!\nApollo:\n...We'd certainly be a novelty act, if nothing else. (I'll think about it if I ever lose my attorney's badge.)\nSpeaker\nApollo:\nA speaker for monitoring the stage. It was blaring at the time of the shooting.\nTrucy:\nIt's a pretty old model for such a nice place.\nApollo:\nI guess they don't care about sound quality back here. As long as you can hear it... (Not that a loss of fidelity could possibly make that music worse...)\nTrucy:\nGood speakers must cost a lot. You have any idea how much a nice one that size would cost, Apollo?\nApollo:\nProbably a good ten years of your allowance, give or take.\nTrucy:\nWhaaat!? But that's almost 600 dollars!\nApollo:\n...... (Five dollars a month...? Poor Trucy... Wait till she finds out you need to buy two speakers for a stereo...)\nTelevision\nApollo:\nThat's one of the biggest, most expensive-looking TVs I've ever seen.\nTrucy:\nToo bad you'll never own one.\nApollo:\n\"Never\"'s kind of harsh, Trucy.\nTrucy:\nHmm. How about \"for all eternity\" then?\nApollo:\nSame difference.\nCut off section of carpet\nApollo:\nHey, look. A part of the carpet has been torn up here.\nTrucy:\nThat was the part we did the luminol testing on in court!\nApollo:\nLuminol... right.\nTrucy:\nYou know what I couldn't stop thinking? Who's going to pay for this carpet?\nApollo:\nAs long as it's not us... Maybe... the shooter?\nTrucy:\nI guess it's true what they say. Crime doesn't pay!\nApollo:\nI would hope that carpet replacement costs weren't the only thing holding you back.\nFlower bouquet\nTrucy:\nThat's one heavy-duty bouquet there.\nApollo:\nI have trouble thinking of flowers as being \"heavy-duty\".\nTrucy:\nBut they call lots of things heavy-duty!\nApollo:\nNot flowers, they don't.\nTrucy:\nWhat about a \"heavy\" scent?\nApollo:\nI think you mean \"heady\".\nTrucy:\nWhat if the flowers were plastic?\nApollo:\nThey still wouldn't be heavy.\nTrucy:\nOK, what if they were made out of metal?\nApollo:\nWhat, like a magnolia made out of steel?\nTrucy:\nExactly! Though I hope all my fans don't start throwing metal flowers at me.\nHairdryer\nApollo:\nThat's one of those permanent dryers you see in hair salons.\nTrucy:\nIs that what they're really called? \"Permanent dryers\"?\nApollo:\nDo I look like a beautician? I just know they dry your hair and give you a permanent...\nTrucy:\nIt just doesn't sound very glamorous, you know?\nApollo:\nOK, how about a \"permachine\"!?\nTrucy:\nOr you could go more simple, like \"permer\"!\nApollo:\n...This isn't a bad game, thinking up official names for things. Not that it makes the name actually official or anything.\nGift boxes\nTrucy:\nA stack of presents for Lamiroir. Stars always get the biggest presents. You know, you could give me a present, Apollo.\nApollo:\n...Here, have a piece of candy.\nTrucy:\nGee! Thanks!!!\nApollo:\n(She must not get a lot of presents... Poor girl.)\nRevolver\nApollo:\nThe murder weapon. So it belonged to Mr. LeTouse.\nTrucy:\nThat thing makes normal revolvers look like water guns!\nApollo:\nMr. LeTouse was a big man. (But how about the person who shot him? Wouldn't they have to be about his size?)\nSmall window\nApollo:\nThis was the window where Lamiroir \"saw\" the crime from... I wish it was that simple.\nTrucy:\nKind of hard to see a crime when you can't see. But she did hear it!\nApollo:\nYeah, but the window was closed...\nTrucy:\nMaybe she heard it some other way?\nThe Stage\nExamine\nComputer\nApollo:\nLook at all the electronics. They must be sound-related.\nTrucy:\nDoesn't seeing a bunch of machines like this make you want to just fiddle with 'em? Can I, Apollo? Please?\nApollo:\nNo, no fiddling! You'll break something.\nTrucy:\nIf you're going to make an omelet, you gotta break some eggs! That's what Daddy always says.\nApollo:\nThese eggs look kind of expensive.\n(Step)ladder\nApollo:\nThat's the ladder we used to climb up the stage tower. ...Not a moment I'm likely to forget any time soon.\nTrucy:\nMe neither... I'll never be able to climb another tower again without thinking about it, you know?\nApollo:\n...I'll never be able to climb a tower again, period.\nStage\nTrucy:\nI still can't believe we found Machi and Mr. LeTouse up there...\nApollo:\nYeah. I used to not like high places. Now I hate them.\nTrucy:\nIt's not like it would have been nicer if we found a dead body closer to the ground. ...Though that reminds me. Daddy's bad with heights, too.\nApollo:\nHuh, no kidding.\nTrucy:\nHe took me on a Ferris wheel ride a while ago, you know! Halfway through, his face got all green and he mumbled \"objection\" over and over.\nApollo:\n(...Poor guy.)\nAfter presenting Video Tape to Valant Gramarye in Wright Anything Agency:\nJuly 9In the Wings\nTrucy:\nThat song... Isn't that the one Lamiroir was singing?\nApollo:\nYeah, you're right. \"The Guitar's Serenade\"...\nTrucy:\nWow, I'd love to do a show on a stage like this!\nApollo:\nI'd come to see that.\nTrucy:\nThe house is full, and as one, the audience sighs with wonderment! There I am, singing my ballad, rose petals swirling through the air...\nApollo:\nNot bad... wait. Aren't you a magician!?\nTrucy:\n...Oh. That's right. I was a magician, wasn't I.\nApollo:\n(Some dedication...)\nValant:\nAh ha! If it isn't Miss Trucy! And indeed it is!\nTrucy:\nUncle Valant!\nApollo:\nWhat exactly are you doing here?\nValant:\n...I take real responsibility in tasks undertaken. I am inspecting my equipment of illusion to make sure naught is amiss. (Changed from [I am inspecting my equipment of illusion to make sure naught is amiss, Miss.] in the original release)\nTrucy:\nThe Lamiroir Teleportation Illusion! Ooh!\nValant:\nShould anything go wrong, it would reflect poorly upon me and my troupe. As I went about my exacting examination, I happened to notice that piano. ...And I remembered that fair lady's melancholy melody.\nTrucy:\nHey Apollo, maybe Uncle Valant can shed some light on this whole thing for us!\nExamine\nPiano\nTrucy:\nThat's one big piano! I've never actually played one.\nApollo:\nHeh. You should get Mr. Wright to teach you sometime.\nTrucy:\nNo good, he can't play either.\nApollo:\n(I kind of feel bad for the guy now...)\nTrucy:\nMaybe now's my big chance! Stand back, this could be the debut of a prodigy! ...Eww.\nApollo:\nDid you make that noise just now?\nTrucy:\nUm... Let me try it again. You know, I think something's stuck in the piano! Time to take a look under the hood... ...Huh. Look! This was stuck between the strings. It looks like some kind of switch.\nApollo:\n(Someone must have thrown this into the piano...)\nSwitch placed in pocket.\nPiano (subsequent times)\nApollo:\nWhat do you think that thing was doing in there?\nTrucy:\nThrowing things inside pianos can't be good for them.\nApollo:\nNot to mention you wouldn't be able to play whatever notes go with the strings it was on. (But the piano was fine during the concert... That must mean it was thrown in here after Machi played.)\nTrucy:\nSo maybe someone threw it in here after the second set...\nTalk\nLamiroir's illusion\nTrucy:\nI was wondering about the show the night of the murder. Lamiroir's vanishing act was your illusion, right?\nValant:\nIndeed. The purple prosecutor petitioned my performance. At the climax of the song, he said, make her disappear. ...Like a dream.\nApollo:\nLike a dream...\nValant:\nYet, what can I work with on a stage meant for musical endeavors? There are none of the conveniences of a stage built for sorcerous acts. It was a challenging task, and so I accepted.\nApollo:\nShe disappeared from the top of the tower... ...But in order to move, you would have had to use some sort of secret tunnel.\nValant:\nPeople come to me because I am a professional among professionals. My illusions are custom-made for a time and a place. ...Now, because of the murder, all the eyes of the nation are on this concert. Not a bad thing, as far as the fortunes of Troupe Gramarye are concerned.\nTrucy:\nSo... you were here checking up on your trick to make sure it went well.\nValant:\nAnd went well it did. Now, speaking of pianos... ...That piano over there troubles me.\nApollo:\nIt troubles you...? Why?\nValant:\nWhy? Why do you ask, why?\nApollo:\n(I think it's probably quicker if I just go check it out myself, thanks.)\nTroupe Gramarye\nValant:\nI know what you are thinking in that head of yours. \"Gramarye, yes,\" you say. \"I recall seeing him on television.\" Something of that sort?\nApollo:\nUm, actually, yes, you're right.\nTrucy:\nWow! He just read your mind, Apollo!\nApollo:\n...Or everyone tells him that and he made a good guess.\nValant:\nIt was twenty years ago... A young magician, a genius of his time, came down among us... His name... was Magnifi Gramarye! It was he who began the great Troupe Gramarye! At his prime, not a day passed that he did not play upon the screens of every TV there was.\nApollo:\n(I do have a vague memory of someone like that on TV...)\nValant:\nYet, several years ago, that time came to an end. My troupe pulled a vanishing act, yes. Cries for magic no longer heard, the TV screen a barren waste, stripped of illusion.\nTrucy:\nTh-That's not true! I still went to all your shows! Like that one in the parking lot down at the supermarket.\nApollo:\n(When you start playing supermarket parking lots, you know you're in trouble.)\nValant:\n...We hone our skill at these small venues, always awaiting our time. ...Yes, one day we will rise, up from obscurity, onto fame's shining stage once more! I do this not only for the magic that is Gramarye, but for my partner...\nApollo:\nYour partner...? You mean...\nValant:\nYes. Zak Gramarye.\nApollo:\n(Trucy's father...)\nValant:\nBefore he disappeared seven years ago... ...there was no name higher than Gramarye in show business circles. None. I will see us returned to glory! I, Valant Gramarye!\nValant and Zak (appears after \"Troupe Gramarye\")\nValant:\nOur founder Magnifi Gramarye was truly a genius, a worker of miracles.\nTrucy:\nI'll never forget the one I saw when I was little! How he made that whole jumbo jet go... um, what happened to the jet again?\nApollo:\n(...Apparently someone doesn't remember it as well as they thought.)\nValant:\nOf all the would-be magicians who came to his door, only Zak and I had the talent. In no time at all, Valant and Zak were the shining stars in the Gramarye crown.\nTrucy:\nCool, huh? And Zak Gramarye was my daddy!\nValant:\nNow that Magnifi and Zak are gone, I have but one wish. Let it be I, Valant Gramarye who brings the Gramarye miracle back to the big stage!\nTrucy:\nI'm rooting for you!\nValant:\nMiss Trucy, you cannot grow up quick enough! I need your skill by my side!\nTrucy:\nOne skill, coming up!\nApollo:\n(How do we manage to get off the topic of the case so quickly all the time?)\nPresent\nAttorney's Badge\nValant:\nAh... The proof positive of your profession, yes?\nApollo:\nUm, yeah.\nValant:\nMight I... have a look? Oh! What's this? It is gone!\nApollo:\nAck! What'd you do with my attorney's badge!?\nValant:\nAh ha ha ha ha ha ha. Don't be alarmed. Miss Trucy! Take a look into your topit, if you would.\nTrucy:\nEek! It's your badge, Apollo! What's it doing in there? That was amazing! Wasn't it, Apollo?\nApollo:\n(He called that pouch at her waist a \"topit\"...? Is that some kind of magician speak?)\nRevolver\nValant:\n...Pardon me? I have no money, if that's what you want.\nApollo:\nAck! No, no, I was just... Um, never mind. (The way he looked at the revolver... What was that? It was almost as if he had seen one before... and maybe wasn't too happy about it.)\nValant:\n......\nVideo Tape\nApollo:\nI was wondering about the stunt in the video, right in the middle of the song.\nTrucy:\nI didn't see a stunt... Oh, that? I guess I'm so used to seeing that happen I didn't even notice.\nApollo:\n(So young to be so jaded...)\nValant:\nA simple sleight-of-hand, a petite prestidigitation. (Changed from [A simple slight-of-hand [sic], a petit prestidigitation.] in the original release) A modicum of magic from me... to you.\nTrucy:\nSo that's why you were at the concert!\nValant:\nYes. I was there to watch my trick take to the air...\nApollo:\nSo! Can you tell me how you did it?\nTrucy:\nWhoa! You can't just ask that sort of thing, Apollo!\nApollo:\nTrucy...?\nTrucy:\nIt's against the rules to ask a magician how they did it.\nApollo:\nNot when you're doing a murder investigation it's not!\nTrucy:\n...Well, you might have a point, there. Will you tell us, Uncle Valant?\nValant:\nIt is against all that is sacred to inquire as to how a trick is performed.\nApollo:\nOK, so you tell me how he did it, Trucy.\nTrucy:\nBut I don't know!\nApollo:\n(C'mon, you're a magician! Aren't you part of the same secret club?)\nAnything else\nValant:\nWords cannot express my shock and chagrin... All I can see before me is this stage, and me, upon it. ...Nothing smaller, nothing less radiant catches my eye.\nTrucy:\nTrue. You're getting on in years. Not much time left to make your mark, huh...\nValant:\n............ This is not how I was seeing it.\nApollo:\n(So he doesn't care about what I have to show him, I get the point...)\nExamine evidence\nSwitch\nButton\nTrucy:\nThis switch, sitting here, tempting me to push it...\nApollo:\nDon't. You might blow up the whole coliseum.\nTrucy:\nApollo, please... To think that every strange switch triggers a bomb... That kind of old-fashioned crime drama thinking doesn't cut it in our busy times!\nApollo:\nAlright, Trucy P.I., please enlighten me. What do you think this switch does?\nTrucy:\nHmm... Maybe it turns on the electric razor in Prosecutor Gavin's dressing room?\nApollo:\n...A switch as big as razor to turn on a razor? OK...\nAfter presenting Headset in Backstage Hallway:\nJuly 9Lamiroir's Dressing Room\n...MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH...\nApollo:\nUh oh... There's only one person I know who can munch with such... venom.\nEma:\n...What are you doing here?\nApollo:\nHello, Ema. You're looking as grumpy as ever.\nEma:\nOh, am I supposed to be happy? You give me the second degree in court, and Prosecutor Gavin makes me look like a fool.\nApollo:\n...You're talking about the blood stain Mr. LeTouse left?\nEma:\nMy department chief had a field day with that one. \"Even a blind person could see the shooter wasn't blind!\" Funny guy, huh?\nTrucy:\nBut that blood stain helped uncover the biggest mystery of all!\nApollo:\nNow we know that Mr. LeTouse was really with Interpol.\nTrucy:\nWe wouldn't have found that out without you!\nEma:\nI suppose. Maybe that's why the chief gave me these after he was finished chewing me out. Said it was my reward.\nApollo:\n...Are chocolate Snackoos popular down at the precinct or something?\nEma:\n...MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH...\nTrucy:\n...I was hoping we could check out the crime scene again.\nEma:\nBe my guest. You're not going to find any clues in here. ...Though I did find something strange.\nTrucy:\nSomething strange?\nExamine\nAir vent\nApollo:\nThat's the air vent with Machi Tobaye's fingerprints.\nTrucy:\n......\nApollo:\nWhat's with the frown?\nEma:\nCan't a girl frown anymore? Is that a crime?\nApollo:\nAck! No, of course not, I just meant...\nEma:\nMachi Tobaye's fingerprints are on that air vent. Why would his fingerprints be there if he wasn't the shooter?\nApollo:\n(That's not a question I want to have to answer in court.)\nEma:\nHey! Wipe that frown off your face. One stick in the mud per crime scene, please.\nApollo:\n(I guess girls can frown, but defense attorneys can't.)\nCut off section of carpet\nApollo:\nLook, the carpet's been torn up here.\nTrucy:\nThat's the part we did the lunimol testing on in court!\nEma:\n\"Loony mall\"? What's \"Loony mall\"!? It's \"Luminol\"! Get it right!\nTrucy:\n...! Ema's kind of scary when it comes to science.\nApollo:\n...Best learn the word and not incite her wrath again.\nTalk\nThe trial today\nEma:\nI met my embarrassment quota for the year, that's for sure.\nTrucy:\nWell, that's a good thing, isn't it?\nEma:\nUm, how?\nTrucy:\nI mean, think about it. Now you don't have to be embarrassed about anything else all year!\nApollo:\n...If only it worked that way.\nEma:\nIt just bugs me to think that little kid outsmarted me. And it makes him even more suspicious now that we know he can see! He could have seen the air duct, and he could have shot that revolver.\nTrucy:\nBut that's not how it sounded in Lamiroir's testimony.\nEma:\nYou mean her saying she heard Detective Daryan's voice at the scene? Hmm...\nTrucy:\nThat's right!\nEma:\nWhy can't we have a normal, straightforward killing once in a while in this country!?\nApollo:\nI'll pretend I didn't hear that.\nThe case\nEma:\nWas that true what you said in court today? You know, about the case... About how everything was happening according to those song lyrics?\nApollo:\n...\"The Guitar's Serenade\", you mean?\nTrucy:\nI found the link, you know! First, Prosecutor Gavin's heart-shaped key ring was stolen. Then Lamiroir flew through the air. Then Prosecutor Gavin's guitar caught on fire. And in the end, a bullet took Mr. LeTouse's life... And he went up into the sky with a guitar... Well, fifteen feet up, at least. (Changed from [And he went up into the sky with a guitar... Well, thirty feet up, at least.] in the original release)\nEma:\nIt is kind of hard to chalk it up to coincidence, hmm.\nTrucy:\nI know! And I found it.\nEma:\nYou think the same person did all of this?\nApollo:\nDon't ask me. I didn't do it.\nEma:\nNeither did I! I couldn't fit through that air vent anyway.\nTrucy:\nWhat... You all think I did it!?\nApollo:\n(Sometimes I worry about that girl.)\nSomething strange\nTrucy:\n...So what did you find?\nEma:\nIt's so little I must have passed over it yesterday. I found it under the sofa.\nTrucy:\n...What is it?\nEma:\nPart of some device, I think. I haven't a clue what. The bit sticking out from the end looked familiar, so I had it examined. Turns out it's an antenna.\nTrucy:\nOoh, like on a beetle?\nEma:\nLike on a cell phone. This device must use an electronic signal of some sort.\nTrucy:\nAn electronic signal, you say? Hmm...\nThe switch (appears after \"Something strange\", then presenting Switch)\nEma:\n...What are you trying to do, burn me alive!?\nApollo:\nC'mon, it was just a few sparks.\nEma:\nSays you! You weren't the one holding it!\nTrucy:\nThere's enough sparks flying around here just with you two talking.\nApollo:\nAnyway... Now we know this is a remote for an igniter.\nEma:\nLet me see that for a second. ......\nApollo:\nWell?\nEma:\nWell, this is definitely a little transmitter. The signal's weak, probably only reaches thirty feet.\nTrucy:\nA transmitter, huh...\nRemote Trigger updated in the Court Record.\nEma:\nIncidentally, if you look at a cross-section diagram of the stage area... ...Let's see, thirty feet from Lamiroir's dressing room... That covers the backstage completely.

He always carried his badge around, too.\nApollo:\nHuh?\nEma:\nI think he did it so he'd never forget who he was, or his duty as a defender. Something like that. Pretty noble, really.\nApollo:\n(I guess there really isn't a need for me to carry this around. Though it seems to have made a decent impression...)\nLyrics Sheet\nEma:\nWhy did they have to commit their crime according to the song? Seems like it'd be more trouble than it's worth.\nTrucy:\nMaybe they were trying to throw off the investigation?\nEma:\nThat's certainly possible. But risky, don't you think? Just carrying someone as big as Mr. LeTouse would be tough enough.\nApollo:\n(She may be a snacking fiend, but sometimes, she actually makes some sense.)\nRevolver\nEma:\nThat's an Interpol-issue revolver, right?\nApollo:\nWhich means it belonged to Mr. LeTouse. He must have had it to begin with.\nEma:\nSounds that way.\nApollo:\nSo, if it was Machi... Are we saying Machi stole it from Mr. LeTouse...?\nEma:\n......\nApollo:\n(Now that's really hard to imagine him doing...)\nSwitch\nApollo:\nDo you think you could take a look at this?\nEma:\nHmm. A small device... Looks like a transmitter.\nTrucy:\nA transmitter?\nEma:\nYou press this switch here and it sends out a signal.

I didn't do it on purpose!\nEma:\nI suppose. At least, we're getting somewhere with this case.\nTrucy:\nHey, Apollo! Let's ask Ema more about this switch! Now that she has some first-hand experience.\nSwitch/Remote Trigger (after clearing \"Something strange\" Talk option; subsequent times)\nEma:\nWhat! You aren't trying to burn me up again, are you? Who sent you to get me? Who?\nApollo:\nI'm not out to get you, promise.\nEma:\nPromise!? No promise is good enough with you still carrying that weapon around! Try burning me again with that trigger of yours... ...and I'll throw 100 bags worth of Snackoos at you!\nApollo:\n(I've never seen someone munch so furiously. Better stay clear for a while.)\nAnything else\nApollo:\nDo you think you could take a look at this, Ema?\nEma:\n...MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH...\nApollo:\nEma...?\nEma:\n...MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH...\nApollo:\n(Her rate of chewing is increasing...

Did you just hear someone laughing?\nIgniter\nIncendiary device\nApollo:\nAll these little parts... It's pretty complex. I'm guessing this is where the fire comes out.

Come to laugh at the murderer?\nTrucy:\nDaryan...\nDaryan:\nThat old bag opens her pie hole, and wham-bam my life goes down the chute. Thanks! They won't let me work while I'm a suspect!\nTrucy:\nDaryan isn't in the best of moods, is he?\nApollo:\nNot many people are these days, it seems.\nTrucy:\nIt is a crime scene. Not exactly the happiest place to hang out.\nDaryan:\nThen Gavin had to go rub salt in the wound... My alibi's rock solid. Rock solid!\nTalk\nYour alibi\nTrucy:\nSo, about your alibi...\nDaryan:\nYou have to ask? The shooting happened right in the middle of the third set!\nApollo:\nUm... that's right. (The music was blaring when we heard those gunshots... ...And found Mr. LeTouse, dead.)\nDaryan:\nI've got ten thousand witnesses who saw me, too. Right there on that stage.\nTrucy:\nYour guitar playing was something else!\nDaryan:\nThanks, little lady. ...See? This whole thing's a sham. I can't believe they aren't letting me work!\nApollo:\nThere's no need to yell at me... (It's Lamiroir's fault... She was the one who said she heard his voice at the moment of the crime...)\nDaryan:\nMan, I never even talked to that old windbag! How could she possibly identify me?\nProsecutor Gavin\nTrucy:\nThey won't let you work?\nDaryan:\nHe won't let me work! Gavin! Says I gotta lie low till the suspicion is cleared. What suspicion!? He can be such a stick in the mud.\nTrucy:\nMr. Gavin? A stick in the mud?\nDaryan:\nHe may look all flashy and showy, but he's straight as an arrow, man. ...'Cept when he's depressed. You hear him whining the other day?\nApollo:\nOh, you mean the thing with the mixing board?\nKlavier:\n...And then there was that performance just now. What was that all about!?\nApollo:\nThis part is off.\nKlavier:\nWhich is that? Hmm... 2nd Guitar.\nDaryan:\nAh.\nKlavier:\nIt was you Daryan!\nDaryan:\nHe's just a perfectionist, is all. Not a bad guy, really.\nTrucy:\nWell, I think the Gavinners are the best! I have all your albums.\nDaryan:\nThe band's fine, too. Gavin can write a good tune, I'll give him that.\nPresent\nLyrics Sheet\nDaryan:\n\"The Guitar's Serenade\", eh? Classic tearjerker, that one.\nTrucy:\nYou don't think he based it on a real experience, do you?\nDaryan:\nProbably not. He writes by feeling, more than memory.\nTrucy:\nOoh! You mean the songs just kind of \"come to him\"?\nDaryan:\nYeah, something like that. I guess you could call him a genius. Of course he changes the song and lyrics on a whim. Drives me up the wall.\nApollo:\nHe makes his court cases on a whim sometimes, too.\nDaryan:\nHe changed the lyrics to a song just before a recording the other day, even. Wants to put in this line about a university student obsessed with girls. Whatever!\nApollo:\n(Hmm? Why does that sound strangely familiar?)\nDaryan:\nOf course it always turns out good in the end. That's his talent, I suppose.\nAnything else\nDaryan:\nLook, if you want to talk about the case, talk to someone else, 'kay? Don't want Gavin having another one of his hissy fits.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nApollo:\nCome to think of it, I haven't seen Prosecutor Gavin around much.\nDaryan:\nOh, him? He's down at the prosecutor's office, most likely.\nApollo:\nThe prosecutor's office... (I've never been there, have I.)\nDaryan:\nThe data on the victim should have come in from Interpol. ...Normally, I'd be down there dealing with it. Normally.\nTrucy:\nApollo! Let's go check it out! I've always wanted to see the prosecutor's office.\nApollo:\nHmm... Maybe that's not such a bad idea.\nTrucy:\nRight on!\nDaryan:\nSay \"hi\" for me, OK? Oh, and \"screw you\". And tell him I want into that crime scene!\nApollo:\n...Um, we'll be going now.\nDaryan:\nHey, wait.\nApollo:\nY...Yes?\nDaryan:\nWhat do you really think happened? Really? You don't think I did it, right?\nApollo:\nW-Well...\nDaryan:\nGreat. Way to instill a guy with some confidence. Just remember, I was ripping it up on stage when it happened, OK? Ripping!\nApollo:\n...!\nDaryan:\nDon't get led astray by some siren song, eh? Get this one wrong, and you'll be eating humble pie for a year. I'll bake it myself.\nTrucy:\nLet's... not talk to him anymore. Alright?\nApollo:\n(Detective Daryan Crescend... He's one stone I'd leave unturned if I had a choice.)\nJuly 9Backstage Hallway\nApollo:\n...This place is deserted.\nTrucy:\nI wonder where Lamiroir went off to?\nApollo:\nI'm sure she's OK on her own. She seems resourceful.\nTrucy:\nI guess... But I can't help worry about her a little.\nJuly 9Prosecutor Gavin's Office\nTrucy:\nSo... this is it. The Gavinners's head office.\nApollo:\nIt's not the band's office. It's the prosecutor's office.\nKlavier:\nYeah, so that's why I am asking, what is this creepy thing... object... whatever.\nApollo:\n...Looks like Prosecutor Gavin is on the phone.\nTrucy:\nOh well, guess we'll have to come back. Or we can hide behind that bookshelf real quiet-like...\nApollo:\n...That's eavesdropping.\nTrucy:\nWhy? We'd just be waiting. Quietly. So he won't notice. (Changed from [Why? We'd just be waiting. Quietly. So he didn't notice.] in the original release) What if we heard something scandalous about the band!?\nApollo:\n(She'd make a good reporter... for a gossip mag.)\nKlavier:\nWhat? A \"replica\"...? So why was he after it in the first place? Yeah, LeTouse!\nApollo:\n(LeTouse...?)\nKlavier:\nLook, don't talk to me about those Borginians, OK? Just get me that report, chop chop. ...And stop leaving mysterious objects in my office, OK?\n...*beep*...\nKlavier:\nIt's times like this when I start to miss Daryan... ...Huh?\nApollo:\nErm, hiya!\nTrucy:\nTee hee! Just thought we'd drop in. Hope you're not mad...?\nKlavier:\n...How could I be? There's not enough \"tee hee\" in the world, in any case. Have a seat.\nApollo:\n(Prosecutor Gavin, the philanthropist.)\nTrucy:\nWatch and learn, Apollo!\nKlavier:\nSo, who have you come to see?\nTrucy:\nHuh?\nKlavier:\nKlavier, lead vocalist for the Gavinners? Or Prosecutor Gavin, scourge of the courtroom?\nTrucy:\nWhat do you think he means, Apollo?\nApollo:\nI think he's giving us a choice. We can either ask him about the concert... or the case. (Which way to go?)\nExamine\nBurnt guitar\nApollo:\nThat was an impressive bit of pyrotechnics that did this.\nTrucy:\nThat's the guitar from the concert, isn't it...\nKlavier:\nI thought it was one of the staff playing a gag on me. I never guessed that wasn't the end of it... I had a specialist analyze the guitar, incidentally.\nTrucy:\nOh? Did you find anything out?\nKlavier:\nHe didn't have a lot of time, so it's still unclear... But the results he came up with were... intriguing.\nApollo:\nIntriguing? (How does that guitar tie into everything that went on?)\nTrucy:\nSounds like something we should ask about.\nGlass case\nTrucy:\nWhat's that on the plate there?\nApollo:\nIs that... gum?\nTrucy:\nGum...?\nApollo:\nMaybe he was chewing it when the phone rang. So he put it on the plate for later consumption.\nTrucy:\nYou'd think a rock star could afford a fresh stick.\nKlavier:\nDon't jump to any conclusions, now. That's no chewing gum. Take a closer look... ...Although I really shouldn't be offering, should I.\nApollo:\n(What is that...? It looks like a lump of plastic...?)\nTrucy:\nWait, that phone call...\nKlavier:\nYeah, so that's why I am asking, what is this creepy thing... object... whatever.\nApollo:\n...Looks like Prosecutor Gavin is on the phone.\nKlavier:\nWhat? A \"replica\"...? So why was he after it in the first place? Yeah, LeTouse!\nApollo:\nProsecutor Gavin, does this have something to do with Mr. LeTouse?\nKlavier:\n...Wait a second! You were listening to my phone call, weren't you!?\nTrucy:\nWho? Us? I-I tried to stop him, really! But he forced me to!\nApollo:\nHey, you were the one digging for a scandal, Ms. Reporter!\nKlavier:\n...To tell the truth, I'm not even sure what it is. (Chagned from [...Too [sic] tell the truth, I'm not even sure what it is.] in the original release) But apparently, it's a model of something undercover agent Mr. LeTouse was after.\nTrucy:\nThis... lump?\nApollo:\nWould you mind telling us what you do know about it?\nGuitar display wall\nApollo:\nLook at all the guitars! Why so many?\nKlavier:\nYou can never have too many guitars. They are like... my lovers.\nApollo:\n(I didn't just hear him say that.)\nTrucy:\nThey're backup guitars, Apollo. Don't you know anything? Rock 'n' rollers always smash their guitars at the end of a show!\nApollo:\nNo wonder it's so hard to make it as a musician.\nTrucy:\nYou know what, you should try rocking a little, Apollo.\nApollo:\nAnd breaking his guitars while he watches? That might be a little too rocking.\nKlavier:\nAh ha ha ha. Of course, I would never do such a thing. Did I not say, they are like my lovers? Do I seem like the kind of man who would do such a thing to ones he loves?\nTrucy:\nNo, no! Not at all! I mean, you're Mr. Gavin, upstanding prosecutor!\nApollo:\n(What happened to Prosecutor Gavin, god of rock?)\nDesk\nTrucy:\nWow, look at that stereo!\nKlavier:\nTo me, a life without music is inconceivable. I never turn down the volume, even when I'm working on a case.\nTrucy:\nThat's such a huge speaker! It must be really loud!\nKlavier:\nThis room is completely soundproof, of course.\nTrucy:\nReally? At my place I can hear when the neighbors turn their VCR on to record something.\nApollo:\nMaybe you can get Mr. Wright to talk to them, work something out?\nTrucy:\nAnd lately, we've been getting complaints about Apollo's voice training.\nApollo:\n...Maybe I'll go have a word with Mr. Wright, too.\nMonitors\nApollo:\nThis display shows all the evidence for the case.\nTrucy:\nLook, Apollo! He's got three televisions!\nKlavier:\nHey, don't look at those too closely. I'm still sorting out the details.\nApollo:\n(Each monitor shows evidence for a different case. He does them all at once!?)\nTrucy:\nI wish I had three TVs.\nApollo:\nWhat would you possibly do with three television sets?\nTrucy:\nI may look laid back and relaxed, but in reality, I'm quite busy, you know! I'm living life at turbo speed! Doing magic, going to school, investigating cases... But... But if I had three big TVs...! I could watch a magic video, do my homework, and catch a crime drama all at once!\nApollo:\nThe first two seem useful, I suppose.\nReclining chair\nApollo:\n......\nTrucy:\nWhat's wrong, Apollo? You look confused.\nApollo:\nI was just wondering where the \"work chair\" in this office was.\nKlavier:\nYou're looking at my favorite chair right now.\nApollo:\n...That's a massage chair, isn't it?\nKlavier:\nThat is an ergonomic, adjustable office--\nTrucy:\nI love the ones with the vibrating rollers on your back! Those feel great!\nKlavier:\n......\nTrucy:\nDid I say something wrong?\nKlavier:\nNo. I merely realized the futility of an explanation.\nWindow\nKlavier:\nThe view is exhilarating, ja? I sit here, gazing down upon the city, writing my songs.\nApollo:\nTry working on cases.\nKlavier:\nIt is the same thing. I write lyrics the same way I corroborate evidence. It is a harmony between the logical mind, and the primal spirit within!\nApollo:\n(Is it so hard to admit that you like staring out your window and daydreaming?)\nTalk\nThe case\nKlavier:\nAh, that reminds me, did you see the paper today?\nTrucy:\nYes! I always read the TV section.\nKlavier:\nGood girl. How about you, Herr Forehead?\nApollo:\n...I read the funnies.\nKlavier:\n...Then you will not have seen this!\nApollo:\n\"Concert of Tragedy -- The Prosecutor's Deadly Song!\"\nTrucy:\nOoh, is that a new show? I haven't heard about that one.\nKlavier:\nIt's not a show. It's an article. News, you know?\nTrucy:\nOh, does this have anything to do with the case...?\nKlavier:\nSince getting back from the trial, my phone has been ringing off the hook! \"How does it feel to take a man's life with a song?\" \"Have you ever hummed a man all the way to death row?\" \"Do you think you could sing for me over the phone?\" ...It is endless. Endless! Thanks to the case you made today, of course.\nTrucy:\nOh, that was all Apollo's idea!\nApollo:\n(Hey!) Hmm? Is that a newspaper over there, too?\nKlavier:\nAh yes. The Borginian Daily Bugle. Go ahead, take a look.\nApollo:\nUm, thanks, but I can't read Borginian.\nKlavier:\nOh, that's right. Suffice it to say this is big news over there as well. Though they didn't go so far as to mention the lyrics to my song.\nTrucy:\nProbably no one in Borginia could believe it.\nKlavier:\n...It's probably seen as \"just a theory\" at this point. Their journalists didn't see the need to mention it.\nApollo:\nThat makes sense. I hardly know what to think of it myself.\nBorginian Newspaper added to the Court Record.\nKlavier:\nLamiroir's testimony will probably be in the evening edition, I'd imagine. Which is why I've had Daryan step down from the investigation for now.\nTrucy:\nYeah, we ran into him moping in front of the coliseum.\nKlavier:\nLamiroir was my invited guest, so it is a rather delicate situation... ...You understand how much I want to solve this case. Quickly, if possible.\nThe case (subsequent times)\nKlavier:\nAh, that reminds me, did you see the paper today?\nTrucy:\nYes! I always read the TV section.\nKlavier:\nGood girl.

Quickly, if possible.\nThe Guitar's Serenade\nTrucy:\nI really love that song. It has such a great atmosphere to it.\nApollo:\nYou co-wrote it with Lamiroir, if I remember correctly?\nKlavier:\nThat's right. It was last year... I had gone to tour Borginia's legal system, as a matter of fact.\nTrucy:\nAnd that's when you heard Lamiroir's voice?\nKlavier:\nIt was at a small jazz club. ...I wept that night. I knew I had to meet her, to talk with her. So I used my influence, which is not inconsiderable, to arrange a meeting.\nTrucy:\nWow, prosecutors really have a lot of clout.\nApollo:\nI think he's sort of a special case, Trucy.\nKlavier:\nThankfully, she liked the work I did, and we wrote a song right there, backstage. Machi on piano, that dulcet voice... And myself on a guitar that I borrowed from Lamiroir.\nTrucy:\nAnd music history was made! Probably not an experience your average lawyer would ever have. Like Apollo, say.\nKlavier:\nIt is a memory I hold dear. And the song we wrote that night... was this. And that very guitar is right over there.\nApollo:\nYou mean... this charred lump?\nTrucy:\nDon't call it a lump! That's a piece of history! And it's only browned, not really \"charred\".\nKlavier:\nNo matter. I shall never sing that song again. I wouldn't have used that guitar again either, even if I could have.\nApollo:\n(What happened during that song, anyway? Why did his guitar suddenly catch on fire?)\nTrucy:\nDo you think you could show it to us? Your charred... I mean slightly burnt guitar?\nApollo:\nI'm sure he doesn't mind. What more could happen to it?\nLamiroir's guitar (appears after clearing \"The Guitar's Serenade\" Talk option and examining burnt guitar)\nKlavier:\n...It was a beautiful instrument. It was played lovingly for many years. A guitar befitting a woman like Lamiroir.\nTrucy:\nHow did it end up here?\nKlavier:\nShe gave it to me. I mentioned how much I enjoyed playing it that night, and she made a present of it.\nTrucy:\nSo this guitar is from Borginia?\nKlavier:\nThat it is. We couldn't carry it on the plane. Changes in air pressure and humidity ruin the wood. So, we vacuum packed it in Lamiroir's studio. I used a special shipping service available to me for transporting evidence. They brought it right up to my office for me. ...Pristine and untouched.\nTrucy:\nSee, prosecutors do have a lot of clout.\nApollo:\nUm, I still think he's a special case.\nTrucy:\nSuch a valuable guitar... It's too bad it got burned.\nProsecutor Gavin's Guitar added to the Court Record.\nApollo:\nWhat was it that you were saying earlier? ...Something about intriguing results from an examination of the guitar?\nTrucy:\nThat's right! What was that all about?\nKlavier:\nWell, you know how guitars have a round hole in the front? It is called the \"sound hole\".\nApollo:\nAh, so that's what it's called.\nKlavier:\nWell, they found something attached to the wood just inside the hole. ...A broken device of some sort.\nTrucy:\nA broken... device?\nKlavier:\nYes. This, in fact. The examiner is busy with evidence for the case now, however. So he'll be checking this out once he's finished with everything else.\nTrucy:\nHmm...\nApollo:\n(Odd. That device looks strangely familiar...)\nLamiroir's guitar (subsequent times)\nKlavier:\n...It was a beautiful instrument. It was played lovingly for many years.

That device looks strangely familiar...)\nThe strange lump (appears after examining glass case)\nKlavier:\nThis was found in Mr. LeTouse's bag. It's apparently a replica of something.\nApollo:\nA replica... (It's a small lump, about an inch and a half long.)\nKlavier:\nWe analyzed it... but there's not much to say, other than it's a lump of plastic. Perhaps it was to be used in the identification of whatever it is a replica of.\nApollo:\nYou mean... whatever Mr. LeTouse was after?\nKlavier:\nThat seems to be the most logical explanation.\nTrucy:\nWell? Well? What is it?\nKlavier:\nDon't ask me, Fräulein.\nTrucy:\nOh? If you don't want to tell us, you could just say so.\nKlavier:\nI've put in a request to Interpol via my contacts in Borginia... But, apparently there is a block on information somewhere along the chain.\nTrucy:\nOh?\nKlavier:\nThere's something either Interpol or Borginia doesn't want to share... (Changed from [Something Interpol doesn't want to tell Borginia...] in the original release) Something about this little piece of plastic.\nApollo:\n(Mr. LeTouse went through all that trouble to become Lamiroir's manager... ...just to come to this country to find out more about... this lump? And he died for it.)\nReplica added to the Court Record.\nKlavier:\nI've sent someone to the coliseum to fetch Lamiroir.

I got all teary-eyed!\nApollo:\nAh yes, the \"cursed song that turned a concert into a tragedy\", wasn't it?\nKlavier:\nI was singing it for you, Fräulein.\nTrucy:\nWhoa! Th-That's so special!\nApollo:\n...It was Lamiroir singing, actually.\nKlavier:\nI am glad you were moved. It is that kind of song.\nApollo:\n(......Ack! I've run out of snide comments!)\nHeadset\nKlavier:\nThat looks like one of our tour-issue headsets. Why are you wearing it, Fräulein?\nTrucy:\nI thought it'd be cool! I could pretend I was concert security and stuff.\nApollo:\nActually, we found it at the venue and thought you might want it.\nKlavier:\nOh, no, please, you keep it. It goes well with your cape, Fräulein.\nTrucy:\nTee hee! You think?\nApollo:\n(She does look like she belongs on a stage, that's for sure.)\nRemote Trigger\nApollo:\nProsecutor Gavin, about this remote... (Wait!)\nKlavier:\nExcuse me, did you say something?\nApollo:\n(This remote control might be valuable ammunition for the trial tomorrow! It's too early to show my hand now...)\nKlavier:\nYou would think someone with such a loud voice would speak more clearly, ja?\nIgniter (after clearing \"Lamiroir's guitar\" Talk option)\nApollo:\n(It has to be one of these...)\nTrucy:\nWhat is it, Apollo?\nApollo:\nThat \"device\" that was found in your guitar...! ...Take a look at this.\nKlavier:\n...! Why, that looks like the same thing! What is it...?\nApollo:\nIt's an igniter.\nTrucy:\nA-Another one!?\nApollo:\nIt was at the crime scene... In Lamiroir's dressing room. Detective Skye found it, actually.\nKlavier:\n...At the scene of the crime? What could that mean, I wonder?\nAnything else\nKlavier:\nMy apologies, but there's no way I'm going to talk details about the case with you. If you want to get my attention, bring me something... dramatic.\nApollo:\n(I'm not here to get your attention, Gavin... ...I'm here to get your information.)\nExamine evidence\nProsecutor Gavin's Guitar\nBurnt area\nApollo:\nThere's lightly scorched, and then there's this...\nTrucy:\nIt's burned clean through!\nApollo:\nYep, It's pretty much a useless piece of junk.\nTrucy:\n...It's kind of like you after a trial, Apollo!\nApollo:\n(Which part? The burned clean through, or the useless piece of junk?)\nReplica\n\"Sample\" label\nApollo:\n\"Sample\", huh? Think they out a big enough label on it?\nTrucy:\nMaybe it's to keep people from eating it by mistake.\nApollo:\nYes, they might think it was an otherwise tasty, multi-colored lump of plastic. (Changed from [Yes, they might think it was an otherwise tasty, white lump of plastic.] in the original release)\nTrucy:\nMaybe it's the manufacturer? \"Sample Toys: When you can't afford the real thing!\"\nApollo:\nSounds like a company Mr. Wright would like.\nAfter clearing all Talk options and correctly presenting Igniter:\nKlavier:\nI believe that covers everything I'm at liberty to talk to you about.\nApollo:\nOh.\nKlavier:\nThanks for dropping by, ...Herr Forehead.\nApollo:\nThanks...?\nKlavier:\nWhy, you gave me so much information! That igniter, for instance...\nApollo:\nOh. That.\nKlavier:\nI've never met an attorney so forthcoming with the prosecution. It's a big help. ...Or perhaps you're just a tad naïve, hmm?\nApollo:\n(...I guess I could have hid it, but somehow, showing it felt like the right thing.) I could say the same... to you, Prosecutor Gavin.\nKlavier:\n...?\nApollo:\nThanks for the information. About the, er, strange lump of plastic. The one that Mr. LeTouse was investigating.\nTrucy:\nHey, that's right...\nKlavier:\nI've been thinking, Herr Forehead. We encounter many incidents in our lives, all of us. Not all of them simple.\nApollo:\n...Especially not the ones where people are killing to song lyrics.\nKlavier:\nThat is why I try to at least remain simple inside. And I keep a simple goal: to discover the truth.\nApollo:\n......\nKlavier:\nThat's why I like to keep relations civil, ja? ...That is all.\nApollo:\n...I can live with that.\nTrucy:\nUm... Mr. Prosecutor?\nKlavier:\nFräulein?\nTrucy:\nCan I ask you why you sing in a band?\nKlavier:\nAh. Because I want women to turn and look when I walk down the street.\nApollo:\nThat's pretty simple, too.\nKlavier:\nNow if you'll excuse me, I've got work to do. Another time, perhaps.\nExamine\nBurnt guitar\nApollo:\nThe charred remains of what was once a fine guitar.\nTrucy:\nMr. Gavin got it as a present from Lamiroir!\nApollo:\nAnd he had it shipped back from Borginia in a vacuum-sealed case.\nTrucy:\nKinda sad how it ended up.\nApollo:\n(...Not to mention there was an igniter placed just inside the sound hole. I wish I knew why...)\nGlass case\nTrucy:\n......\nApollo:\nWhy the sudden silence, Trucy?\nTrucy:\nOh, I'm sorry. It's nothing, really. I was just wondering, wouldn't it be cool if that replica just happened to vanish?\nApollo:\n(Ah, the young magician at work again.)\nTrucy:\nThough a simple disappearance would kind of lack punch. What if it hatched into a dove? Or a person, dressed like a dove...\nApollo:\n(There she goes...)\nGuitar display wall\nApollo:\nThese guitars are vintage models. Probably pretty expensive, too.\nTrucy:\nThey've even got little locks on them!\nApollo:\nWeren't you good at picking locks?\nTrucy:\nApollo! You don't want me to...? ...Well, I do kinda like that cherry red one!\nApollo:\nI'm kidding! I'm kidding!\nTrucy:\nOh. That's too bad.\nApollo:\n(Sorry, my little thief in the making. Maybe next time.)\nDesk\nApollo:\nThat's an insanely big speaker for a room this small. Oh, look... All the CDs are Gavinners CDs.\nMonitors\nTrucy:\nHe left his TV on. Think we should turn it off for him?\nApollo:\nNah, wouldn't want to make him angry.\nTrucy:\nOK, if you say so. It's kind of a waste of electricity.\nApollo:\nYou just want to play with his TV. I know you.\nTrucy:\nTee hee! How'd you know? It's just, I've never seen a TV this big before!\nApollo:\nI hate to break it to you, but it's actually a monitor. It doesn't play TV shows.\nTrucy:\nWhat!? You mean no soap operas!? No Saturday morning cartoons!?\nApollo:\n...Nope. Sorry.\nTrucy:\nI... I had no idea.\nApollo:\n(There, there, you'll get over it.)\nReclining chair\nTrucy:\nWhat a cool chair! I'm going to sit in it now while no one's looking! Wow! So this is what it feels like to be a star!\nApollo:\n(Who would have thought a chair could bring so much joy into someone's life.)\nTrucy:\nI can imagine sitting here, strumming my guitar... \"Oh, it's you, Herr Forehead. Sorry... I'm busy. Woooo.\"\nApollo:\nYou know, that was a remarkably good imitation.\nTrucy:\nTee hee! Maybe I'll make that part of my Wonder Bar repertoire!\nWindow\nApollo:\nWhat floor are we on again? The view is incredible!\nTrucy:\nWow! The people look like little rice grains! Hey! That one with the blonde hair! Do you think that's Mr. Gavin?\nApollo:\nUh... He's a little too small to see.\nTrucy:\nBut look at the one next to him with the big black poof of hair pointing straight ahead!\nApollo:\nOh yeah, that's Daryan alright.\nAfter examining glass case in Prosecutor Gavin's Office:\nJuly 9Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nTrucy:\nLooks like Machi is in questioning.\nApollo:\nHuh, the police must have a Borginian interpreter. That's no fair. I wish we could talk to him.\nTrucy:\nI guess we'll just have to come back later if we want to see him.\nApollo:\nI guess so.\nExamine\nSecurity camera\nApollo:\nThat security camera is looking at me. Does that thing just sit there recording 24 hours a day? It must use one of those ultra-long-play tapes.\nSecurity guard\nApollo:\nA security guard. He stands here, watching this room. I think the guard is trying to set a record for the longest time without blinking.\nJuly 9Sunshine Coliseum\nEma:\n...Oh, it's you. You came at a good time.\nApollo:\nHello there, Ema. What's up?\nEma:\nEither of you know where Lamiroir is?\nApollo:\nUm... well, I saw her in the backstage hallway a while ago.\nEma:\nYeah? That's strange...\nTrucy:\nWhat's strange?\nEma:\nI can't find her anywhere. I was supposed to bring her to the prosecutor's office...\nApollo:\n(Lamiroir's missing!?)\nEma:\nIt's hard to imagine her wandering off somewhere on her own. ...Being that she's blind and all.\nApollo:\nYeah. We'll help you look for her.\nEma:\nGreat! Thanks.\nJuly 9, 4:46 PMIn the Wings\nTrucy:\nHuh? The stage is pitch dark!\nApollo:\nThe power breaker must be off for this section... Great.\nTrucy:\nI'll go get someone! Yipes, it was really dark out there.\nApollo:\nDark... That's all Lamiroir has, when you think about it. (What would it be like to live in a world of darkness?)\nTrucy:\n...Hey, Apollo.\nApollo:\nHuh? What?\nTrucy:\n...Doesn't something about the stage seem different to you? Like, something's changed?\nApollo:\nChanged?\nTrucy:\nI can't put my finger on it, but it's bugging me.\nApollo:\n(Now it's bugging me, too! What's she talking about?)\nExamine\nGuitar case\nLeads to:\n\"Hey, that case...\"\nTrucy:\nHey, that case... Wasn't that open before?\nApollo:\nHuh. I guess someone closed it.\nTrucy:\nWait... Look! Where the case closes...\nApollo:\nSomething's sticking out! That... doesn't look like an instrument. You don't think it's...\nTrucy:\nLet's open it, Apollo! Eeeeeeeek! Lamiroir! Lamiroooooooir!\nApollo:\nEma! We have to get Ema!\nApollo:\n(Lamiroir was taken directly to the hospital. Ema ran around, barking orders, making phone calls. Trucy just clung to my arm and cried... And me, I was still in shock. Two bodies in two days is two too many.)\nJuly 9, 5:53 PMHickfield ClinicWaiting Room\nTrucy:\nEma! How's Lamiroir? Is she OK?\nEma:\nAh, you. We all owe you a big \"thanks\", that's for sure.\nTrucy:\nSo... she's OK?\nEma:\nYes. She came to a short while ago. You found her before it was too late.\nTrucy:\nTh-That's good to hear...\nApollo:\nSo, what happened!?\nEma:\nSomeone attacked her. ...She was struck on the forehead.\nApollo:\nBy who!?\nEma:\nWe don't know.\nTrucy:\nBut they hit her on the forehead, right? That's right in front of her! How could she not see... Oh.\nEma:\nRight. Would you like to see her now?\nApollo:\nIs that alright?\nEma:\nShe wants to thank you for saving her life.\nApollo:\nLamiroir!\nLamiroir:\nAh, Mr. Attorney. You were the one who found me? Thank you from the bottom of my heart.\nApollo:\nI-I'm just glad you're OK. Tell me, what happened?\nLamiroir:\n......\nExamine\nHallway\nApollo:\nThe door down the hall reads \"X-ray Room\". I never did like X-rays... I don't think I'd enjoy looking at someone's insides. Spotting nervous tics is intense enough.\nMan on crutches\nApollo:\nThat must be a recovering patient. He keeps staring at us. What's so unusual about an attorney and a magician?\nReception desk\nApollo:\nA nurse watches, hawk-like, from the reception desk. She glares at me whenever I talk. Maybe my voice carries?\nWaiting area\nApollo:\nSome visitors are here in the waiting room, watching TV.\nTV:\n\"...murder during a concert at Sunshine Coliseum...\"\nApollo:\nHuh, looks like we're on the news.\nTV:\n\"...with his current hit song, \"Guilty Love\", is in the courtroom as prosecutor... ...singing the defendant all the way to death row...\"\nApollo:\n...... Prosecutor Gavin this, Prosecutor Gavin that! Where's my fifteen minutes!?\nTV:\n\"...The Guitar's Serenade... On sale now!\"\nTalk\nAttacked!\nLamiroir:\nIt was after I spoke with you in front of the dressing room. I sensed someone approaching. I thought it might be someone come to see me, but they said nothing. When I went to return to my dressing room...\nApollo:\n...You were hit?\nLamiroir:\nI knew, that very moment, I knew! The assailant... was trying to kill me.\nTrucy:\nAck!\nLamiroir:\nIt was lucky for me the first blow did not knock me out. I turned and ran for the stage. Someone was chasing me, I could hear footsteps... Yet I reached the stage first.\nApollo:\nWhy the stage?\nLamiroir:\nI had overheard maintenance people talking. The power to the stage area was off, they said, for electrical work.\nTrucy:\nAh...\nLamiroir:\nDarkness is my ally. There was a contrabass case near the stage. That is where I hid.\nApollo:\nSo the assailant couldn't see you!\nLamiroir:\nOnce in the case... I'm afraid I passed out.\nApollo:\nWow, that sounds like a really close call.\nThe assailant\nApollo:\nDo you have any idea who it might have been?\nLamiroir:\nUnfortunately, no. Whoever it was, they said not a word.\nApollo:\nToo bad...\nLamiroir:\nYet, when I consider that I was struck high on the forehead... I must conclude that whoever hit me was taller than I am.\nApollo:\nGood point... (She's sharp!)\nTrucy:\nAnd you're much taller than I am. You're about as tall as Apollo.\nApollo:\nSo, that means it was likely an adult, and probably a man. (...Could it be him!?)\nTrucy:\nBut why would anyone attack you, Lamiroir!?\nLamiroir:\nThe detective asked me this, too. And to her I gave the same answer I give you: I do not know.\nApollo:\nHmm...\nThe Borginian Cocoon (appears after presenting Replica)\nLamiroir:\nWell, they call it \"Borginian\"... It must only be found in Borginia. For certain, all in Borginia know of these.\nTrucy:\nIt's a cocoon... so, do you get silk from it?\nLamiroir:\nI do not know the details, I am sorry to say.\nApollo:\n(I thought she said all in Borginia knew of these?)\nLamiroir:\nThere is one fact I do know about the cocoon, though. Something all in Borginia know.\nApollo:\n...What's that?\nLamiroir:\nThe cocoons... They are not to be taken out of the country. If someone does, and is caught, they will be put to death.\nTrucy:\nT-T-T-To death!?\nApollo:\nWhy!?\nLamiroir:\nI do not know. Yet, if Interpol was involved... ...I'm sure there is a good reason.\nTrucy:\nBut this is just a piece of plastic!\nApollo:\nHe was carrying a replica... but looking for the real deal. That's my best guess.\nTrucy:\nSo, that's what he was up to?\nApollo:\nTracking down Borginian Cocoon smuggling...\nTrucy:\nSmuggling...\nSmuggling (appears after \"The Borginian Cocoon\")\nLamiroir:\nIt seems I was \"marked\".\nTrucy:\n\"Marked\"...?\nLamiroir:\nLife changed for me with the popularity of my songs. I began to travel around the world.\nTrucy:\nAh! So you could have brought those Borginian Cocoons with you...\nLamiroir:\n...On my trips, yes. That was probably the suspicion.\nApollo:\nAnd Mr. LeTouse was placed as an undercover agent to look into it.\nLamiroir:\nBorginia is a small, sheltered country. Not many of our people venture into the world outside.\nTrucy:\nIs that why they suspected you?\nApollo:\nBut... Mr. LeTouse wasn't a Borginian, was he. He was an Interpol agent, which means...\nTrucy:\nWhat, Apollo?\nApollo:\nThere must be some reason why Borginia didn't want those cocoons getting out. (Changed from [Well, there must have been some reason other countries didn't want the cocoons out.] in the original release) Something scary enough to get Interpol involved.\nTrucy:\nHuh? Like what? How could such a tiny ball of thread cause such a commotion?\nPresent\nReplica\nApollo:\nAh, Lamiroir, I wanted to ask you about this. Do you know what this is?\nLamiroir:\nThis... this is what?\nApollo:\nMr. LeTouse was carrying it. It's a replica of the thing he was after.\nLamiroir:\nHe was \"after\"...?\nTrucy:\nYou know, in his secret identity! As an undercover agent!\nLamiroir:\n...So that's what he was doing.\nApollo:\n...! You mean, you know what...\nLamiroir:\nYes, I know, of course. This must be... ...a Borginian Cocoon. ...Or rather a convincing replica thereof.\nApollo:\n(Why haven't I heard of a Borginian Cocoon before?)\nTrucy:\nWhy would he be carrying this around? Was it some kind of souvenir?\nLamiroir:\nI wonder...\nAnything else\nLamiroir:\nI'm sorry, I'm not quite recovered from the attack...\nApollo:\n(She looks like she's had a rough day... I'll just put this piece of evidence away for later.)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nApollo:\n(Cocoon smuggling... And Mr. LeTouse had Lamiroir marked... Hmm...) ...It couldn't be her.\nTrucy:\nHuh?\nApollo:\n(There's one other person I need to talk to!) Thank you for talking to us, Lamiroir!\nLamiroir:\nIt was the least I could do.\nApollo:\nActually, I have another request.\nLamiroir:\nIf it is within my power...\nApollo:\nI need an interpreter. Someone who speaks Borginian.\nTrucy:\nApollo...?\nLamiroir:\n......\nApollo:\nWould you come with us, if you're well enough?\nLamiroir:\nI see... Yes, yes of course. I shall accompany you.\nTrucy:\nHuh? Where are we going?\nApollo:\nC'mon, Trucy. We're about to get to the bottom of this!\nJuly 9Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nApollo:\nMachi... We came to talk to you about the case.\nLamiroir:\nMachi...\nMachi:\n! ................\nApollo:\nCould you interpret for us, Lamiroir?\nLamiroir:\nYes.\nApollo:\nMachi... I'd like to talk to you about when we first met. ...When we still thought you were blind.\nLamiroir:\n[Foreign text]....\nMachi:\n....................\nApollo:\nNow we know the truth. You can see, right?\nTrucy:\nI was completely fooled, myself.\nApollo:\nMachi... Isn't there another secret you're hiding from us?\nMachi:\n......!\nLamiroir:\nWait, Mr. Attorney! What do you mean by \"secret\"?\nMachi:\n............\nApollo:\nWhat do I mean by \"secret\"? Well...\nPresent Replica\nApollo:\nLeads to:\n\"If I'm not mistaken...\"\nPresent anything else\nApollo:\nApollo:\nDo you know what this is?\nMachi:\n................[Foreign text]\nLamiroir:\nAh, Mr. Attorney...\nApollo:\nI don't need a translation to understand that. I'd know that \"wrong evidence\" look anywhere.\nLamiroir:\nI'd imagine you would.\nApollo:\n(Ugh, let's try that again.)\nLeads back to:\n\"What do I mean by \"secret\"? Well...\"\nApollo:\nIf I'm not mistaken... ...you know something about this, don't you!?\nMachi:\n......!\nTrucy:\nHey, you got a reaction! A big one!\nLamiroir:\nMachi, you didn't...!\nApollo:\n...Trucy and I are trained to see people's uncertainty. Not that we would have needed any training to see that one.\nMachi:\n....................\nLamiroir:\nMr. Attorney, please tell me what this is all about!\nApollo:\nLamiroir, please, interpret!\nLamiroir:\n...Very well.\nApollo:\nI know you know something about this by your reaction. If you won't tell me, I might have to give it to the prosecution... ...and have them look into it!\nMachi:\n! .................... [Foreign text]!\nLamiroir:\nHe asks you to \"wait, do not be so hasty.\"\nTrucy:\nM-Machi...?\nMachi:\n.................... [Foreign text]....[Foreign text]?\nLamiroir:\n\"Do you know everything?\"\nApollo:\n...Yes, everything. Well, sort of.\nTrucy:\nHave him tell us about it!\nMachi:\n....[Foreign text]....\nLamiroir:\n\"Very well\"...\nTalk\nThe Cocoon\nLeads to:\n\"What is this cocoon, anyway?\"\nPresent\nAnything\nMachi:\n....................\nLamiroir:\nMachi, he is upset he could not speak with you.\nTrucy:\nWell, let's hear him out before he gets grumpy, Apollo!\nTrucy:\nWhat is this cocoon, anyway?\nMachi:\n[Foreign text]....\nLamiroir:\n\"The cocoon, the silk, is a potent cure.\"\nTrucy:\nA cure...?\nApollo:\nIt must cure some disease.\nMachi:\n[Foreign text]....\nLamiroir:\nIt's a cure for \"Incuritis\".\nApollo:\nA cure for Incuritis?\nReplica updated in the Court Record.\nTrucy:\nBut, if it's a cure, why keep it in Borginia like that? Just think of all the lives they could save by sharing the medicine!\nMachi:\n....................\nLamiroir:\nI do not understand the reasons myself.\nApollo:\nOK, well, at least we know what it is: a cure. And Mr. LeTouse was after cocoon smugglers. Wait, was Machi...?\nLamiroir:\nMachi, you weren't...!\nTrucy:\nHe couldn't be a smuggler! He's so little!\nApollo:\nWell, you're only 15, and you're sort of a magician, aren't you?\nTrucy:\nWell, that's true. I am sort of a magician.\nApollo:\n(She said \"sort of\"! Oh, to have a copy of that security camera tape...)\nTrucy:\nWell, Machi? Are you... a smuggler?\nMachi:\n[Foreign text]....\nLamiroir:\n[Foreign text]!\nMachi:\n....................\nLamiroir:\nHe... won't tell me.\nTrucy:\nFirst he plays blind, now he plays dumb...\nApollo:\nI wonder... Do you think he brought a cocoon here to sell it to someone? If Machi really did bring one into the country... ...was he planning on making a deal for its sale?\nMachi:\n[Foreign text]....\nLamiroir:\n\"I can't go home\"...\nTrucy:\nCan't go home!?\nMachi:\n....[Foreign text]....[Foreign text] ....[Foreign text]....\nLamiroir:\n\"I can't go home to Borginia. I do not want to go home.\" The penalty for taking a cocoon from Borginia... is death.\nApollo:\n(That's right! It's punishable by death!)\nMachi:\n[Foreign text]........\nLamiroir:\n\"About the case...\"? What about the case?\nApollo:\n(He wants to tell us about Mr. LeTouse's death!?)\nMachi:\n[Foreign text], [Foreign text]....\n???:\nThis meeting's over.\nTrucy:\n...Daryan?\nApollo:\nWh-What do you mean? Visiting hours aren't over yet.\nDaryan:\nThere's a call for Machi from the Borginian Embassy. This meeting is over. ...Sorry.\nApollo:\nJust give us five more minutes. We can call them back after that.\nDaryan:\nSorry, no go. C'mon, piano-boy. We're leaving.\nTrucy:\nDaryan! Wait!\nDaryan:\n...I never liked you. Either of you.\nApollo:\nHuh...?\nTrucy:\nDarn it! We were so close! He was about to tell us! Hey, Apollo...\nApollo:\n(He didn't want us to hear what Machi had to say...)\nTrucy:\nApollo!\nApollo:\n(...And there can be only one reason why.)\nTrucy:\nWhy is everyone ignoring me!?\nApollo:\nOh, sorry! (This is it... I know who I'm after now. It all happens tomorrow... in court!)\nTo be continued.\nThe Stage (before clearing \"The Cocoon\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room)\nExamine\nGuitar case\nApollo:\nThe giant instrument case that Lamiroir was hiding in. Things like this wouldn't happen if people didn't make such big cases!\nTrucy:\n...I'm not sure the case is to blame here, Apollo. We have to find whoever did this to her. No one hits a siren of the ballad on my watch and gets away with it!\nApollo:\nDon't worry. We'll find her assailant.\nNothing to examine during investigation\nApollo:\nNo clues here.",

Time to bring down a little Justice!)...BANG!...Trucy:\nEeek!Apollo:\nWh-What was that!????:\nHe is heard but unseen...Trucy:\nWho's that talking...?Apollo:\n...Valant Gramarye! (...I exclaimed as he walked in through the door. Normally.) (Changed from [...Valant Gramarye! (...Using the door like an average muggle, no less.)] in the original release)Trucy:\nYou... aren't the witness today, are you, Uncle Valant?Valant:\nAh ha ha ha ha ha! A preposterous proposition. How could I stand to stand upon the stand? Why, my secrets would be free for the plucking! ...I might even have to sign autographs! That is why I intend to remain hidden for the entire day.Trucy:\nOoh, with vanishing magic!?Valant:\nIndeed! I will jump upon an express train, and express myself to the next town over! But before I go... a word of warning.Trucy:\nWarning...? What?Valant:\nA grand Gramarye glamour resides at the root of all that has happened. Do not forget this truth.Apollo:\nA... glamour?Valant:\nA spell, a sorcery... a great illusion! ...Miss Trucy, though it pains me to part so... ...I need to get in line for a ticket. Farewell!Trucy:\nAnd there he goes.Apollo:\nHe sure seemed happy about that illusion thing...Trucy:\nOh, big illusions are the bread and butter of a magician! You can't pull off a show without one! The big illusion is always a spectacle to remember! Usually, it involves cutting up things, like people or elephants... ...or the Eiffel Tower. Anything, really!Apollo:\nSo he was talking about what we saw at the concert.Trucy:\nLamiroir's disappearing act.Apollo:\nAnd Prosecutor Gavin's exploding guitar.Trucy:\nI wonder what he meant by it being at \"the root of all that has happened\"?Apollo:\nWell, it's about time. Shall we go?Bailiff:\nAh, excuse me, sir.Apollo:\nY-Yes?Bailiff:\nThe scheduled starting time for the trial has been changed. The trial will not be commencing until 10:30 AM. Sorry for the inconvenience.Apollo:\nHuh? Did something happen? This is a first...Bailiff:\nIt was by the judge's request. Some urgent personal business.Apollo:\n(Great. I bet he stayed up too late last night, watching courtroom dramas.)Bailiff:\nApparently, he's visiting the hospital again.Apollo:\nThe hospital?Bailiff:\nI believe it was mentioned that the Chief Justice's son is unwell. Apparently his condition worsened considerably this morning.Apollo:\nThe Chief Justice's son...Trucy:\nOh, that's right... Remember yesterday morning? The judge said he had to go visit him after the trial.Bailiff:\nThere's an article about it in the newspaper. If you care to read about it yourself...Newspaper Article added to the Court Record.Apollo:\n(\"Incuritis\"...? Where have I heard that before?)Trucy:\nI'll let you read that article for us, Apollo! Just leave the TV guide page to me!Apollo:\n...Try not to lose the page with the funnies if you can.July 10, 10:30 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:\nAhem. My apologies for the delay. Court is now in session for the trial of... erm, how do you say this name again?Klavier:\nMachi Tobaye... our suspect fortissimo.Judge:\n...Right. It's his trial, in any case.Apollo:\nThe defense is prepared, Your Honor.Klavier:\nThe prosecution... is ready to rock.Judge:\n......Apollo:\nI-Is something wrong, Your Honor?Judge:\nNo. Well, yes... It's just, I've been friends with the Chief Justice since we were students. It pains me to see him going through such a difficult time.Trucy:\n\"Incuritis\", was it? That article said there is no known cure!Klavier:\nHerr Judge, let me say, with all honesty, I feel your pain. But, now is not the time for tears. Now is the time... for law.Judge:\n...Indeed. We left off at quite the juncture yesterday.Daryan:\nI asked Interpol about that number. \"IPXX314206\"... The agent registered under this number... ...was Romein LeTouse.Judge:\nThanks for looking into that for us, Detective Crescend. It's a great help.Daryan:\nOh, no problem at all, Your Honor. ...I'll be heading out...???:Lamiroir:\nWait! That voice just now... ............ It was him. I am sure of it.Judge:\nIt was \"him\"?Lamiroir:\nThat voice I heard, talking to Mr. LeTouse... when I heard the gunshots fired. It was him! It was Mr. Daryan!Daryan:\n...No way...Klavier:\nQuite a sensational ending. Who would have thought Daryan would guest star in the season cliff-hanger... as a suspect?Judge:\nI asked the prosecution to look into this matter. ...Please tell the court your findings.Klavier:\nDaryan Crescend is a member of my band, the Gavinners... ...He is also a detective, making the current charges serious indeed. Yet, after investigation, I have found no cause to alter our case, or file new charges.Apollo:\n...And your reason is?Klavier:\nWeren't you aware, Herr Forehead? He has an impeccable alibi.Judge:\nAn alibi?Klavier:\nLet us review the facts again, shall we? The concert held on the night of the shooting was in three sets. The Gavinners ripped up the stage during the first set. For the second set, our guest took center stage... The only performers appearing were myself, Lamiroir, and Machi... ...along with a drummer and bassist, for a total of five. The shooting in the dressing room, however, took place during the third set. Lamiroir and the defendant, Machi Tobaye had left the stage at that point... ...and the Gavinners were already rocking. This is when two shots rang out at the scene of the crime. Shots heard by Detective Ema Skye, mind you.Trucy:\nAnd Apollo. You heard them too, right?Apollo:\nI sure did.Klavier:\nFurthermore, Lamiroir herself witnessed the moment of the crime... ...Well, perhaps I should say, she \"heard\" the moment of the crime. ...When she claims to have heard Mr. LeTouse and Detective Crescend \"talking\".Judge:\nB-But that's impossible! Detective Crescend was...Klavier:\nPrecisely. Detective Crescend was on stage, getting his groove on, no less. Voila. A perfect alibi!Judge:\nHmm. Does the defense have anything to add to this?Apollo:\n(It's true. When I heard those gunshots, he must have been on stage. Still, there's something here that doesn't quite add up...)Judge:\n...It appears the defense has no objections. I believe we can safely say that Daryan Crescend's alibi has been acknowledged.Klavier:\nWhich means that Lamiroir was sadly mistaken. Her testimony cannot be true.Judge:\nVery well. Of course, if we disregard her testimony... ...then I see no evidence keeping us from declaring a verdict. ...If indeed, there are no objections?Trucy:\nUh oh, Apollo! If he declares a verdict now...Apollo:\n(Ack! But Prosecutor Gavin's case is airtight! Lamiroir might have been lying to protect Machi! How can I rely on her testimony...? Wait... What about yesterday in the detention center...?)Machi:\n[Foreign text]........Lamiroir:\n\"About the case...\"? What about the case?Apollo:\n(He wants to tell us about Mr. LeTouse's death!?)Machi:\n[Foreign text], [Foreign text]....???:\nThis meeting's over.Trucy:\n...Daryan?Apollo:\n(Machi was trying to tell us something, I know it! ...Maybe the best thing to do is ask him... under oath!)Judge:\nVery well. The court finds the defendant, er, what was his name again?Apollo:Apollo:\nYour Honor!!!Judge:\nNo, that wasn't it. It was something like \"marquis\" or-- ...Mr. Justice?Apollo:\nYour Honor, before you declare a verdict, I would like to call another witness!Klavier:\nExactly who else do you need to hear from?Apollo:\nA witness who, until now, has not been given a chance to speak in this court. ...Because he doesn't speak English.Klavier:\nYou don't mean...Apollo:\nI do. The defense calls defendant Machi Tobaye to the stand!Judge:\nWh-What!? But he doesn't speak English...Apollo:\nWe'll use an interpreter!Klavier:\nInterpreter? I'm afraid you'll have to look elsewhere. I only speak a few phrases, such as, \"I love you,\" and, \"Where is the toilet?\"Apollo:\nThe defense would like to request Lamiroir as the interpreter.Judge:\nL-Lamiroir!? But there's a possibility she's protecting the defendant...!Apollo:\nBut she'd be interpreting for the defendant! Why would she lie?Judge:\nThis is most unusual...Klavier:\nAh ha ha... Bravo, Herr Forehead. Herr Judge! The prosecution agrees with the defense's request. If Lamiroir lies, I'll be able to tell. Even my limited knowledge of the language should be enough for that.Judge:\nWell, if both prosecution and defense are for this, I see little cause for refusal.Apollo:\n(Finally! Some progress!)Judge:\nBailiff! Please show the defendant and Lamiroir to the witness stand!Klavier:\nI suppose there is a first time for everything. Shall we proceed? Your name, to begin with. ...If you would, Lamiroir.Lamiroir:\nYes... He says, \"Machi Tobaye, the defendant.\"Judge:\nHmm, this is certainly a first for this courtroom. Not that we really needed an interpretation of that message in particular.Apollo:\n(So far, so good...)Judge:\nVery well. Mr. Justice, if you would.Apollo:\nHuh? If I would what, Your Honor?Judge:\n\"Would what\"!? You called the defendant to the stand, did you not? What would you have him testify about!?Apollo:\nWhat do I want him to testify about...? (Ack, I hadn't thought that far yet!)Trucy:\nApollo! Aren't you going to ask him what he was about to tell us yesterday?Apollo:\nHow can I if I don't know what he was saying...?Lamiroir:\nExcuse me, a moment. If I might speak?Judge:\nYes, Lamiroir?Lamiroir:\nJust now, Machi said there is something about which he \"wishes to testify\".Apollo:\n(Machi wants to testify about something? What could it be?)Judge:\nWhat sort of testimony is he talking about?Lamiroir:\n...One moment, please.Apollo:\n(Argh! The suspense is killing me...)Lamiroir:\nWhat...!?Apollo:\n(What? What!?)Judge:\nW-Well, Lamiroir?Lamiroir:\nAccording to Machi... He has \"proof of his innocence\".Judge:\nWh-Wh-Whaaaaaaat!?Klavier:\n...This is a surprise.Trucy:\nYahoo! Victory, Apollo! We did it!Apollo:\n(This is sounding too good to believe. And I know what that usually means...)Judge:\nWell, if that's true, then this is vital testimony! Lamiroir... I mean, Machi! Please testify to the court!Lamiroir:\n\"Very well.\"Witness Testimony-- Proof of Innocence --Lamiroir:\nHe says that word of Mr. LeTouse's death came as a great shock.\nBut if the killing truly followed the lyrics of my song...\n...I, that is, he, could not have done it.\nHe says that because the lyrics are in English, he does not understand them.Judge:\nHmm. I see! He wouldn't have understood the English lyrics to the song. That would prevent him from following them so closely.Klavier:\nI wondered what he meant by \"proof\". Why, he would only have to ask Lamiroir to know the meaning of that song.Apollo:\nLamiroir! Did you ever explain the lyrics of that song to him?Lamiroir:\nI did tell him, generally, what the song was about. But never in so much detail. And he never asked.Klavier:\nHas my oft-repeated warning already fled that forehead? Lamiroir might be protecting the witness!Apollo:\n......Judge:\nWell, anyway, let us proceed with the cross-examination. Mr. Justice, if you would.Apollo:\nYes, Your Honor. (Something's hidden in that testimony, I know it. I'll just have to trust my bracelet to tell me where! It worked yesterday, it'll work today!)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Proof of Innocence --Lamiroir:\nHe says that word of Mr. LeTouse's death came as a great shock.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nWere Machi and Mr. LeTouse close?\nLamiroir:\nYes, after we traveled around the world on tour together...\nKlavier:\n\nKlavier:\nLamiroir... This is Machi's cross-examination, not yours.\nLamiroir:\nBut I knew the answer...\nKlavier:\nThis is a court of law. We'll play by the book.\nLamiroir:\n...I understand.\nTrucy:\nWhen Prosecutor Gavin's tough, he's really tough!\nLamiroir:\nMachi says he was very good friends with Mr. LeTouse. \"Mr. LeTouse was always a gentle man, never angry..

Machi could not have done all the things that happened that day. For all those things followed the song lyrics closely...Lamiroir:\nHe says that because the lyrics are in English, he does not understand them.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nWouldn't it be difficult for him to perform without knowing the meaning of the lyrics?\nLamiroir:\nHe did know what the song was about, its mood, shall we say. This was enough to play by. I told him it was a song about a \"guitar in love\".\nKlavier:\nIt's... not actually the guitar that's in love, strictly speaking.\nLamiroir:\nOh? Perhaps I misunderstood!\nKlavier:\nAh, no, not really. Yours is also a valid interpretation.\nApollo:\n(Um... OK?)\nLamiroir:\nNo, it is my fault. I am too used to singing in Borginian.

Do you not know \"Español\", for instance?\nApollo:\n(Well, yeah, but...)\nLamiroir:\nI am sorry, but he truly does not understand your language.\nApollo:\nW-Well then explain this! How does he know the crime followed the lyrics!?\nLamiroir:\n...... Have you always been such a suspicious-minded lad? It is simple. So simple it hardly requires an explanation. ...He read about it in the newspaper.\nApollo:\nThe newspaper!?\nLamiroir:\nThe Borginian Daily Bugle.

Wait... no, of course there is!)Trucy:\nWhat is this cocoon, anyway?Machi:\n[Foreign text]....Lamiroir:\n\"The cocoon, the silk, is a potent cure.\"Trucy:\nA cure...?Trucy:\nWell, Machi? Are you... a smuggler?Machi:\n[Foreign text]....Lamiroir:\n[Foreign text]!Machi:\n....................Lamiroir:\nHe... won't tell me.Apollo:\n(That cocoon has to have something to do with this!) Machi. Please, tell us the truth, for your own sake.Machi:\n...No. No more speak. Not... to any of you.Klavier:\nSo much for your precious trust, Herr Forehead.Apollo:\n(Hey, you were the one who didn't believe him!)Klavier:\nRegardless, this brings us to an impasse.Judge:\nIt does seem that the defense and defendant are at odds. ...I doubt we are likely to learn anything more of value should this continue. I see no other course but to declare a five-minute recess! The defense will work things out with the defendant so that we might proceed!July 10, 11:23 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2Machi:\n...Apollo Yoostis...Apollo:\n(That's \"Justice\". Better learn how to say it if you ever want to get some.)Machi:\nBelieve. I no shooting.Apollo:\n(Machi claims Mr. LeTouse was already down on the ground when he entered the room.)Trucy:\nMaybe... it was a trap, and he walked right into it?Machi:\nSuddenly. I hear revolver. Close. Very close. Then, I hear voice.Apollo:\nYou heard gunshots?Machi:\nYes. Is true. I hear revolver. But only sound.Apollo:\nWait, you're saying you went into the dressing room... ...and found Mr. LeTouse already dead, and THEN you heard shots? (If that's true...!)Trucy:\nSo... you were at the scene of the crime when you heard those shots?Apollo:\nAnd you escaped through the air vent.Machi:\nI know.Trucy:\nHuh? What do you know?Machi:\nI know if I opening vent... ...I can leave stage and back... backstage.Apollo:\n(So the vents went to both the stage and the backstage area? Is that what he means...?)Trucy:\nHey, he's right! Look, Apollo!Apollo:\nHuh... Yeah. But how did you know it was connected like that?Trucy:\nWait, I bet his father was the architect that designed the hall or something!Machi:\nI hear this. From magician.Apollo:\nMagician...?Trucy:\nD-Don't look at me!Apollo:\n(A magician, huh?)Trucy:\nWell, at least we're clear on one thing: Machi didn't shoot Mr. LeTouse!Apollo:\nYeah, but what does that leave us with? We're supposed to say he went into the room to find the body and then he heard the shots? (That one's going to go over well in court. Not.)Trucy:\nApollo! You're his defense! You're supposed to believe whatever he says. Even lies! That's what Daddy always told me!Apollo:\nUm, I'll just pretend you misheard him. Every time. So... what do we do?Trucy:\nYou're sure you won't testify, Machi?Machi:\nI... no talking. No.Trucy:\nHmm, well it was worth a shot.Apollo:\n(That cocoon...)Machi:\n[Foreign text]....Lamiroir:\n\"I can't go home\"...Trucy:\nCan't go home!?Machi:\n....[Foreign text]....[Foreign text] ....[Foreign text]....Lamiroir:\n\"I can't go home to Borginia. I do not want to go home.\" The penalty for taking a cocoon from Borginia... is death.Apollo:\n(That's right! It's punishable by death!)Apollo:\n(Of course... He's scared.) ...Oh well, I guess we'll just have to try a different approach.Trucy:\nThat's the spirit, Apollo! So, what's your plan?Apollo:\nIf Machi won't testify about it, we'll have to get someone else to testify.Trucy:\nSomeone... else?Apollo:\n...I think we're out of time. Let's get back in there.Trucy:\nRight!July 10, 11:28 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:\n...Court is now back in session. Mr. Justice. Have you sorted things out with the defendant?Apollo:\nYes, Your Honor. We had a good talk.Judge:\nHmm, very well. So will he testify?Apollo:\nYour Honor, the defendant... will not testify.Judge:\nWh-What!?Klavier:\n...... Shame. And here I thought this was your big chance to turn the case around.Apollo:\nActually, it is. ...The defense would like to approach this case from a different angle, Your Honor!Judge:\nA different... angle?Apollo:\n(If Machi won't testify... ...then I know who will!) I would like to cross-examine the witness in this case... Lamiroir!Judge:\nL-Lamiroir...?Klavier:Klavier:\nWhat are you up to now? I thought we determined yesterday that Lamiroir's testimony was insubstantial! There's nothing you can--Apollo:\n...Lamiroir was taken to the hospital yesterday with injuries.Judge:\nWhat happened?Apollo:\nShe was assaulted, Your Honor.Judge:\nAssaulted!?Apollo:\nSomeone wanted Lamiroir dead. Thankfully, she was able to save herself...Klavier:\nWhat!? I've heard no such report!Apollo:\nProsecutor Gavin...Klavier:\n!Apollo:\nWhy would anyone be out to kill Lamiroir? Can you think of a reason?Klavier:\nW-Well...Apollo:\nThink of how she is known in our country... A singer, from overseas, who doesn't speak English, yes? Yet someone tried to keep her mouth shut! Who could that have been?Judge:\nYou don't think...Apollo:\nI do! It was the same person who shot Mr. LeTouse! The killer was afraid of her, afraid of what she might say! The defense believes that something was hidden in her testimony yesterday. Something that the killer doesn't want getting out!Klavier:\nSo, am I to understand that this is what you are saying? Namely, that there is a nugget of \"truth\" in Lamiroir's testimony... ...A nugget we have yet to uncover?Apollo:\n...Exactly.Judge:\nHmm... If Lamiroir was attacked, this has serious implications! Very well... There were some vague points in her testimony during yesterday's trial. Perhaps we did not inquire as deeply as we might have into some. The court will hear Lamiroir's testimony once more!Klavier:\n...Lamiroir, I must apologize. We must ask you to stand again and speak.Lamiroir:\nYou need not apologize. I know that Machi is innocent. And I will do all that I can until the court realizes this.Apollo:\nLet's review your testimony from yesterday. You told us you heard two gunshots and the shooter's voice through the window. ...And that the voice belonged to Daryan Crescend, yes?Lamiroir:\n...That is correct.Klavier:\nAt which point I proved she could not be correct. She couldn't have heard any of those things. The small window at the scene was closed, and was found to be quite soundproof.Apollo:\n......Judge:\n...You have nothing to say to that, Mr. Justice?Apollo:\nI don't know exactly what, yet, but I do know there's something there!Klavier:\nThere is, it seems, much you do not know.Judge:\nAnd yet it is my duty to hear him out. Perhaps the witness would be so kind as to testify once more to the court?Lamiroir:\n...Of course, Your Honor.Witness Testimony-- What I Heard --Lamiroir:\nI was on my way from the stage to the backstage exit.\nThat's when I heard them: Mr. LeTouse and the detective.\nI heard the faint sound of a gunshot and stopped. Then I heard another gunshot.\nThere was the smell of gunpowder... I knew I must tell someone, but...\nI was in a hurry, so I kept moving past the small window.Judge:\nHmm... Pretty much the same as yesterday's testimony.Lamiroir:\nI am sorry. I am not used to speaking much in this language. Perhaps my descriptions are lacking in some way. Yet, everything I have said here is the truth.Klavier:\nThen it is my distinct displeasure to say this. What you have said to have happened... is impossible.Apollo:\nDo I have to repeat myself? Lamiroir was attacked because of this testimony!Klavier:\n...!Trucy:\n......Apollo:\nWh-What? Trucy?Trucy:\nApollo... You know, for a moment there... ...You were pretty cool.Apollo:\n(...Maybe I do better when I don't try to think ahead.)Judge:\nVery well, Mr. Justice. Perhaps you can \"coolly\" cross-examine the witness?Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- What I Heard --Lamiroir:\nI was on my way from the stage to the backstage exit.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\n......\nLamiroir:\nIs something wrong?\nApollo:\n(I raised an objection... ...but she's saying the same thing she said before...)\nJudge:\nMr. Justice?\nApollo:\nS-Sorry, it's nothing. Please continue with your testimony.\nJudge:\nHmm. Now I know what they mean about the reckless youth these days.\nKlavier:\nThe one in red over there is a shining example, Herr Judge.\nApollo:\n(You're the last person who should be pointing fingers, Mr. Rock Star...)Lamiroir:\nThat's when I heard them: Mr. LeTouse and the detective.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nDaryan Crescend...?\nLamiroir:\nI did not know his name at the time. But yes, it was him, the one who took the stand yesterday.\nKlavier:\nHow many times do I need to remind you that's impossible? There is no way you could have heard him.\nApollo:\nBecause the window at the scene was closed? Is that why?\nKlavier:\nOf course.\nTrucy:\nApollo! If we keep asking the same questions as yesterday we won't get anywhere!\nApollo:\n(She's right. Maybe there's a different angle I can try?)\n\n\n\nWhat were they talking about?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nLamiroir, do you by any chance remember what they were saying to each other? If so, please tell us!\nKlavier:\n......\nLamiroir:\nI have given it much reflection, but...\nApollo:\n(I was afraid of this. She doesn't remember...)\nLamiroir:\n...I only heard one phrase clearly.\nApollo:\nA whole phrase!?\nKlavier:\nYou remember something that was said!?\nApollo:\nWhy didn't you say anything yesterday!?\nLamiroir:\nThough my memory is clear, I was afraid to speak. You see, I do not understand what was said.\nApollo:\n(This could be it! The clue I've been waiting for!) W-Well what did he say!?\nLamiroir:\nIt was the other man speaking, not Mr. LeTouse.\nApollo:\nThe shooter, then. (Daryan Crescend...)\nJudge:\nWell, what did he say!?\nLamiroir:\n...... \"It's over. Press the switch! Now!\"\nJudge:\n\"Switch\"...? And the shooter said this to the victim, Mr. LeTouse?\nLamiroir:\nI thought it quite strange myself, afterward.\nJudge:\nHmm. It is a mystery. What could it possibly mean? Mr. Justice? Care to shed some light on this?\nApollo:\nUrk. Um, I mean, sure...! I-I'd be delighted... It's, um, very, very vital! Maybe we could add that to the testimony!\nTrucy:\n\"Maybe\", Apollo?\nAdds statement \"From the small window, I heard a voice say, \"Press the switch! Now!\"\"\n\n\n\n\nDid you hear anything else?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nDid you happen to hear anything else at that time?\nLamiroir:\nAnything else...?\nApollo:\nAnything else besides the victim and the shooter's conversation. Anything at all.\nKlavier:\nThat's quite the vague question.\nLamiroir:\n...... Other than the conversation? I heard a clock ticking, the two men breathing, footsteps. ...That is all.\nKlavier:\nNothing new there, as expected.\nApollo:\n(Ack! I was hoping for a little more than that!)\nJudge:\nPerhaps we should just carry on with the cross-examination.\nLamiroir:\nAs you wish.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nNo need\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n(On second thought, maybe I'll just play it safe here. See, I can be calm and collected, too, sometimes!)\nTrucy:\nDon't get too calm, or you might grind to a halt.\nApollo:\nThanks for the vote of confidence.\nTrucy:\nI liked you better before with the \"do I have to repeat myself\" bit.\nApollo:\n(Argh, so which should I be? ...Maybe I am overthinking this whole thing.)\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after adding statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nSo, you remember a part of their conversation.\nLamiroir:\nYes, the conversation between Mr. LeTouse and the detective. I remember it quite clearly.Lamiroir:\nFrom the small window, I heard a voice say, \"Press the switch! Now!\"Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nAnd it was Detective Daryan Crescend's voice?\nLamiroir:\nYes, I am sure of it.\nJudge:\n\"It's over. Press the switch.\" Why would he say that to Mr. LeTouse?\nTrucy:\nApollo! The murder weapon, the revolver was Mr. LeTouse's, right?\nApollo:\nYeah... what of it?\nTrucy:\nWell, maybe when he said, \"Press the switch\"... ...he really meant to say, \"Pull the trigger!\" Because his English isn't so good!\nApollo:\n...... Daryan Crescend is a native speaker!\nTrucy:\nOh. Oh, right! Sorry, I kind of forgot who was what.\nApollo:\n(\"Press the switch\"...

I'd call that an \"impossibility\".Apollo:\n...Why?Klavier:\nIt's hardly necessary for me to remind the court of the layout of the concert forum. The stage is quite far from Lamiroir's dressing room. Not to mention that the Gavinners were in the middle of a concert on said stage. We aren't known for being a quiet band. You could shout all you wanted and not be heard.Lamiroir:\nThe detective's voice was loud... but certainly not a shout.Klavier:\nSo, too, have Herr Forehead's cries of \"possibility\" fallen far short of being heard...Apollo:\n...Sorry, but he wouldn't have needed to shout.Klavier:\n...Excuse me?Apollo:\nYou heard what I said. Or... do you need me to shout it out for you? It would have been quite simple to be heard on the stage from that dressing room. Oh, wait, you like evidence don't you? How about this!

Device?Apollo:\nFrom what I've heard, that night... ...everyone on stage was wearing one of these. Isn't that right, Prosecutor Gavin?Klavier:\nAh, yes, actually.

To avoid interference with the audio systems, their range is quite limited.Trucy:\nLamiroir said it was about thirty feet, right?Apollo:\nLook at this cross-section diagram of the concert forum.Klavier:\nAh...Apollo:\nExactly. The walk from the stage to the backstage seems far. But the direct distance is less than thirty feet!Klavier:\nThat... can't be...Judge:\nSo, when Lamiroir heard the shooter's voice... ...he could have been talking to someone on stage!Klavier:Klavier:\nHah! You're claiming this is the \"switch\" in question? Why did it have to be on the stage at the time? It could be placed in a pocket and carried anywhere! Someone could have hid it on the stage after the fact!Trucy:\nHey... he's got a point! How do we know where it was when she heard the voice? ...When the shooter said \"press the switch\"?Apollo:\nWell, I guess we don't...Judge:\nHmm... An unfortunate situation. I'm afraid that until we know where this switch was, there's little point in debating it.Apollo:\nUgh... (I was sure this was the way to go with this...!)Klavier:\nWhat is this switch, anyway? We don't even know that basic fact.Apollo:\n...... (Wait a second... I do know what this \"switch\" is! And if you follow that train of logic to its incredible conclusion... ...it ends up in proof that completely changes this case!)Trucy:\nWhat's up, Apollo? Apollo...?Apollo:\nWe know about this \"switch\", right? We know what it is.Trucy:\nY...Yeah?Apollo:\nWell... think of when it was used that day... Think of what happened!Judge:\nWell, Mr. Justice? If you have no further information to share concerning this switch...Apollo:\n...Your Honor!Judge:\nYes, Mr. Justice?Apollo:\nI've been remiss in not telling the court this before. I know what this \"switch\" is.Judge:\nHmm... Well, it seems the defense is set upon linking this switch to the case. Let's see your evidence of the link! What evidence do you have to explain what this \"switch\" is?Present Igniter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Prosecutor Gavin, you remember this?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nJudge:\n......\nApollo:\n(...Huh?)\nKlavier:\nI fail to see how this evidence links the \"switch\" to this case in any way.\nJudge:\nMr. Justice... Might I recommend a \"switch\" of evidence?\nApollo:\n(Ugh... I knew it.)\nJudge:\nOnce again, please!\nLeads back to:\n\"What evidence do you have to explain what this \"switch\" is?\"Apollo:\nProsecutor Gavin, you remember this?Klavier:\nAch! That's that...Judge:\nThat what!? Is it another one of those new-fangled phones!?Apollo:\nThis... is an igniter. (What phone looks like this!?)Judge:\nI-I-Igniter? You mean it's like a lighter?Apollo:\nYes, actually.Klavier:\nYou aren't saying this switch is a remote...?Apollo:\nI am. This is a remote trigger for an igniter.Klavier:\nWhat...?Apollo:\nLook, I'll show you.Judge:\n.................. Yow yow yow yow yow! Mr. Justice! You will cease and desist from burning down this courtroom!Apollo:\nEr, sorry. That was a bit more fire than I'd expected.Judge:\nIf my whiskers had caught on fire...Apollo:\n...Prosecutor Gavin. Let me repeat myself. This switch is a remote igniter trigger.Klavier:\n......Apollo:\nDoesn't that suggest something to you?Klavier:\nYou're... talking about what happened to me, aren't you?Trucy:\nAh...!Apollo:\nExactly. That night at the concert there was one unusual burst of flame. ...When your guitar caught fire in the middle of the performance!Judge:\nWasn't that part of the stage show, though?Apollo:\nProsecutor Gavin was entirely unaware such a thing had been planned. And the guitar that burned was a valuable keepsake.Trucy:\nThat's right... He got it in Borginia from Lamiroir! He said the sound was amazing. Before it burned, of course. Now it just kind of smokes.Klavier:\nThe better the guitar, the brighter it burns. Herr Forehead!Apollo:\nYes?Klavier:\nDon't tell me you're trying to tie these two things together? Those being the shooter's voice, heard by Lamiroir... ...and the guitar suddenly catching on fire?Apollo:\nI am. It's really simple when you think about it. Mr. LeTouse and the shooter were at the crime scene. The shooter was wearing a headset. He ordered someone on stage to \"press the switch\". The switch was pressed, and the guitar caught fire.Judge:\nWell, that does seem to make sense... Though something about it is bugging me. Can't quite put my finger on it...Apollo:\nReally? It seems pretty simple to me.Klavier:Klavier:\nHerr Forehead, don't destroy what little respect I have for you!Apollo:\n......Klavier:\nI was expecting something a little more... sensible. I guess I was wrong.Judge:\nWhat's this all about, Prosecutor Gavin?Klavier:\nHis simple story simply makes no sense. Think! That night, my guitar caught fire, yes. The cause... may have been this, indeed. However! The guitar caught fire during the second set!Trucy:\nAck! That's right! Of course! The guitar caught fire during Lamiroir's song!Klavier:\nIndeed. Yet the shooting happened during the third set. The two are utterly unrelated!Judge:\nHmm, yes, that must have been what was bugging me. The whole premise for this is faulty!Klavier:\nSee? His story makes no sense.Apollo:Apollo:\nAre you sure about that?Judge:\n...! What exactly do you mean, Mr. Justice?Apollo:\nMaybe it's not the premise for my explanation of the switch that's at fault... ...Maybe it's our premise for the entire case so far!Judge:\nWhat premise is this, specifically?Apollo:\nI'm glad you asked. I'm saying that maybe the killing didn't take place in the third act!Klavier:Klavier:\nWhat's this? But Detective Ema Skye heard shots and found the body. All of this happened in the third act!Apollo:Apollo:\nGunshots rang out... And, according to his testimony, Machi was in that dressing room at the time.Judge:\nWhere are you going with this, Mr. Justice?Apollo:\nStay with me, Your Honor! He also told us this in his testimony: Namely, that the victim had already been shot! We all heard gunshots... but no one saw the shooting!Klavier:\nThis... This is insane!Apollo:\nJust before the \"shooting\" took place, the \"shooter\" was heard on his headset... ...telling someone to \"press the switch\"! The next moment, Prosecutor Gavin's guitar burst into flame. We know that a remote triggered igniter was inside the guitar. From all these facts, we can draw only one conclusion! The crime did not take place during the third act... ...but during the ballad performance... The second act!Klavier:\nWhaaat!?Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! B-But that goes against the evidence!Apollo:\n...What does, Your Honor?Judge:\nThis crime was carried out according to the lyrics of that song, yes?Trucy:\nHey, he's right! Look! The \"bullet\" is supposed to come after the \"fire\"!Apollo:\nYou're thinking about it the wrong way.Trucy:\nHuh?Apollo:\nLook... Why would the shooter craft the events of the day to follow the lyrics anyway? It's an awful lot of trouble to go through. ...With little merit for the person doing it.Judge:\nWell, I'm sure whoever it was had some reason...Apollo:\nYes, they did. A reason that made it advantageous to follow the lyrics.Klavier:\n...You're saying the order was reversed on purpose!Judge:\nHmm? Reversed, Prosecutor Gavin?Klavier:\nIf the criminal followed the lyrics strictly, then yes... ...the shooting would have had to come after the guitar burst into flame. Yet, Herr Forehead has raised another possibility. He's claiming that the bullet came not after, but just before the \"fire\".Apollo:\n...Couldn't have put it better myself. We were only meant to think that the shooting came after the guitar burst into flame! That was the criminal's objective! The crime followed the lyrics to a point, but that was the ruse! Why else would the killer risk discovery by moving the body? That was the final touch to make us think he'd followed the lyrics the whole way!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! That would explain this most unusual situation...Apollo:\nIt does! The killer changed the order of events to create himself an alibi! In other words... The killer was someone who had an alibi for the third set, but not the second!Klavier:Klavier:\nI was hoping it wouldn't come to this. But sadly, it has. Let me tell you why your little fairy tale makes no sense at all.Apollo:\n......Klavier:\nOh, it sounds good, I'll give you that. You've given us a reason why the killer bothered following the lyrics of my song. But I question your logic! ...For it's flawed from the very beginning.Apollo:\nFlawed?Klavier:\nYes. A contradiction, Herr Forehead, one I've pointed out several times, no less. At the time of the crime, the small window at the scene was closed... How could Lamiroir have heard a voice through it?Apollo:\nOh...Klavier:\nI know that you would like to divert our attention from this critical fact. But you're basing your entire line of reasoning on a false premise!Apollo:\n...... (Right... Lamiroir's testimony is my entire case... ...That voice she heard... The shooter's voice...)Trucy:\nW-What if she couldn't hear it, Apollo?Apollo:\nLook, what do we have. A man saying \"press the switch!\" And near the crime scene, we have a switch. Which acts as a remote trigger for an igniter. And last, but not least, Prosecutor Gavin's flaming guitar. (It can't all be coincidence! But how do I make it work?)Klavier:\nI see a more direct line of questioning is required. When the crime scene was investigated, immediately after the crime... ...that window was closed! Care to tell us how Lamiroir heard the voice?Judge:\nHmm... A key point, to be sure. ...Mr. Justice! Can you explain this to the court?Apollo:\n(OK Justice, you've got one thing to prove, and one thing only. Lamiroir heard a \"voice\"... ...and she heard it during the second set! Think! How was Lamiroir able to hear the voice?)The window was open.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nObviously, the window was open... It had to be for her to hear the voice!\nKlavier:\n\nKlavier:\nNews bulletin, Herr Forehead: That horse is dead. Stop beating it, for all our sakes. That window was closed! This is a hard fact, reported by the investigation team.\nApollo:\nB-But...\nKlavier:\nOh? You have evidence to the contrary, perhaps?\nApollo:\nWell, no, but...\nKlavier:\nThen do be quiet. I tire of this charade.\nApollo:\n(Grr... Time to rethink this!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Lamiroir heard a \"voice\"...\"She has divine hearing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nThe window was closed, as you say, yet Lamiroir could still hear the voice... ...because she has the power of divine hearing! That's the only explanation!\nLamiroir:\n......\nKlavier:\n......\nJudge:\n...The witness is a Siren, Mr. Justice. Not a Saint.\nApollo:\nUm, I said \"hearing\", Your Honor, not \"healing\". (Well that fell on deaf ears.)\nLamiroir:\nI'm not sure I know what this \"divine hearing\" ability is...\nKlavier:\nThen perhaps we should hear it straight from the All-Powerful Voice himself. Care to explain how clairaudience has anything to do with this case?\nApollo:\nUh... Erm... Can we just move on now?\nJudge:\nOnly if you can enlighten this court!\nApollo:\n(Time to rethink this...!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Lamiroir heard a \"voice\"...\"She was somewhere else.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"When we investigated the scene, the window was closed.\"Apollo:\nWhen we investigated the scene, the window was closed. The shooter had no reason to close it, had it been open, either. Meaning, it was impossible to hear the voice through that window.Klavier:\nAh, it's good to hear you making sense again. For a moment, I was afraid you might be a Borginian, too.Apollo:\n...As I was saying, Lamiroir could not hear the voice through that window. So there can be only one explanation. She heard the voice from another location entirely!Judge:\nWh-What's this...?Klavier:\nHa ha ha, you do amuse me so. And here I thought you and good sense were back on speaking terms. Now, I'm afraid you and good sense speak two entirely different languages.Apollo:\n......Klavier:\nShall I interpret for you, Herr Forehead? Lamiroir clearly stated she heard the voice through that small window! And there is only one \"small window\" at the scene!Apollo:\n...Are you sure?Klavier:\n!Apollo:\nThink about it... Isn't there another \"small window\" at the scene?Trucy:\nTh-There is!?Judge:\nAh, I know that look. He wants us to ask him. Very well. You claim Lamiroir heard the voice from another location? Mr. Justice, show us where this location was!Apollo:\nLamiroir heard the voice from... here!Present air vent above ladder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...This is where Lamiroir heard that voice from.\"Present small window\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nThere! That's a small window!\nKlavier:\nAnd this changes what?\nApollo:\n(Not much, I know...) ...Erm, I couldn't find anything better, so...\nJudge:\nThe court applauds your honesty. And weeps for your case, Mr. Justice.\nApollo:\n(You're not the only one crying here...)\nTrucy:\nApollo! Think it through again!\nApollo:\nI know... I'm trying... (Lamiroir claims she heard the voice through a \"small window\". ...And if the small window we know about was closed... ...there's only one other thing she could have meant!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Lamiroir heard the voice from... here!\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nJudge:\n...... Does this look like a small window to you, Mr. Justice?\nApollo:\n...The state of modern society can be read from numerous objects and artifacts. In a sense, anything can be a \"window\" on our society.\nJudge:\nI didn't ask you to point out a window on society. I want a window on the crime scene!\nApollo:\n(No points for trying...? Lamiroir claims she heard the voice through a \"small window\". ...And if the small window we know about was closed... ...there's only one other thing she could have meant!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Lamiroir heard the voice from... here!\"Apollo:\n...This is where Lamiroir heard that voice from.Judge:\nB-But that's no \"small window\"! That's the air vent!Apollo:\nWhat did she tell us? She said she's a Borginian, unfamiliar with our language! It's not a stretch to imagine she called this \"air vent\" a \"small window\"!Klavier:Klavier:\nNow you've done it. You've gone beyond ridiculous and into... ludicrous. So Lamiroir was up in the ventilation system listening to this man's voice?Apollo:\nThat's the only logical explanation, yes.Klavier:\n\"Logical\"? I do not think this word means what you think it means, Herr Forehead!Apollo:\nOK, what about it isn't logical?Klavier:\nHah! It hardly merits saying! Why would Lamiroir be in the ventilation system? Hiding like a rat! No offense intended to her, of course.Apollo:\nThe explanation for that is simple, Prosecutor Gavin. Isn't it... Lamiroir?Lamiroir:\n...!Apollo:\nYou have been listening to our discussion here, yes?Lamiroir:\n...Yes. I admit, it's had me quite confused since yesterday. Yes, the small window was closed... ...but why should that mean I could not hear through it? I feared our prosecutor might himself need an interpreter...Klavier:\nUrk...Apollo:\nThe problem here is words. Lamiroir, this \"small window\" through which you heard the voice... Was it up high, on the ceiling of the room? Not low on a wall?Lamiroir:\n...Yes, it was up on the ceiling.Klavier:\nWhaaaat!?Judge:\nOrder! Order! I will have order!!!Judge:\n...Witness! You will clarify this statement to the court! Are you, in fact, saying that you were up above the ceiling of the room? And that's where you heard the moment of the crime?Lamiroir:\nYes, in fact, I was. I am sorry. I never imagined it would become such an important point...Apollo:\nYes, well... why the heck were you up there!?Lamiroir:\n......Judge:\nI believe it's time for another testimony.Lamiroir:\nI... I'm not sure I... I can't.Judge:\nMay I remind you this is a murder trial? We will hear your testimony! Tell us why you \"witnessed\" the crime from above the ceiling of that room! ...Please.Lamiroir:\n......Apollo:\n(Well... Looks like I'm on the right track...)Witness Testimony-- Above the Ceiling --Lamiroir:\nYes, I was above the ceiling when I heard the voice.\nI had heard there was a, er, \"small window\" there before.\nIt was in the middle of my performance... I had no time to report what I had heard.\nAs to why I was there... I cannot say.\nI am bound to secrecy on this matter.Judge:\nB-Bound to secrecy!?Lamiroir:\nIn my line of work, one has many obligations to uphold.Judge:\nBut you say you were in the middle of your performance! So this did happen during the second set!Lamiroir:\n...I did not witness the crime, you must understand. I only know what I heard.Judge:\nYes, but you must tell us what you were doing, in detail!Klavier:\nThat's what the cross-examination is for, ja, Herr Forehead?Apollo:\n...!Klavier:\nOur mission in this court is to discern the truth. No obligation, no binding pact, may hinder that mission.Judge:\nHmm... Very well. Mr. Justice, you may begin the cross-examination.Trucy:\nWh-What are you going to do, Apollo!?Apollo:\n...I'm going to find out the truth. (...She was up above that ceiling for a reason. I just have to get it out of her.)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Above the Ceiling --Lamiroir:\nYes, I was above the ceiling when I heard the voice.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nAbove the ceiling...

It goes from the stage, through the backstage to the rear of the forum.Judge:\nAh... Aaaaah!Apollo:\nRecall Lamiroir's testimony from yesterday...Lamiroir:\nI was on my way from the stage to the backstage exit. There was something like a little window there... That's how I saw it.Judge:\nShe went from the stage to the backstage exit... ...a perfect description of this route above the ceiling!Apollo:\nLamiroir knew of this because of her part in the illusion. But she wasn't the only one who knew.Klavier:\nWhat...?Apollo:\nJust now in the lobby, Machi told me something:Machi:\nI know. I know if I opening vent...  ...I can leave stage and back... backstage.Klavier:\nHe said that!?Apollo:\nOh, were you not informed, Prosecutor Gavin?Klavier:\n............ I... I knew about the vanishing act, of course. Yet, I had no idea of the route that would be used. Why didn't that magician tell me!Trucy:\nMagicians only reveal details of their acts on a need-to-know basis. They're the bread and butter of a magician's life, you know.Apollo:\n(Which is why he bound Lamiroir to secrecy...) ...Well, Lamiroir?Lamiroir:\n...I am impressed, Mr. Attorney. Machi was right about you.Judge:\nSo... what does this mean? Are you saying you used this route above the ceiling?Lamiroir:\n...I did.Judge:\nWell, that's that... but I'm still a little confused.Apollo:\nWhy's that, Your Honor?Judge:\nAs I said before... There was very little time between when she disappeared and when she reappeared. Twenty seconds, tops! How could she do it so fast? Especially if she stopped to hear the shooter's voice!Apollo:\nThat... That's a good question.Judge:\nCan the witness explain this to the court?Lamiroir:\nI... cannot.Judge:\n...Very well. Mr. Justice?Apollo:\nYes?Judge:\nIt's all up to you. Do your thing.Apollo:\nUm, what thing, Your Honor?Judge:\nYou need to explain how Lamiroir was able to teleport like she did. Or I'm throwing your case out with the bathwater.Apollo:\nUgh... (Why do I get picked on? It's Lamiroir who isn't going along with the program here!)Lamiroir:\nAs I have stated before... I am not at liberty to speak of the illusion that night in detail.Judge:\nThen, you'll just have to tell us what you can. We'll hear your testimony on this. Mr. Justice, it will be your job to wring the truth out of her.Lamiroir:\nYes, if you would, please.Apollo:\n...Right. (I feel like a student before finals...)Trucy:\nGood luck, Apollo!Witness Testimony-- The Big Illusion --Lamiroir:\nI followed the route exactly as I was instructed.\nThere is an emergency exit in the backstage, where a stagehand waited.\nFrom there, one can enter the forum on the opposite side from the stage.\nThe plan was for me to move there in two minutes.\nI was on my way, when I heard the voice.Judge:\nHmm... Two minutes, you say? The mystery deepens!Apollo:\n(I suppose it was too much to hope that the judge would come up with something...)Judge:\nAs does my curiosity! Take it away, Mr. Justice.Apollo:\n...Right, Your Honor. (All I have to do is find the contradiction between what Lamiroir is saying... ...and what we can see plainly in the video.)Trucy:\nI figured it out already! I am a magician, after all.Apollo:\nWell, tell me!Trucy:\nNot a chance! I can't reveal another magician's secrets! C'mon!Apollo:\n(Hey! You're supposed to be on my side here!)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Big Illusion --Lamiroir:\nI followed the route exactly as I was instructed.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nHow did you, er, proceed along this \"route\"?\nLamiroir:\nHow? Why, I walked.\nApollo:\nBut you arrived behind the forum much too fast to have been walking! Tell the truth Lamiroir... you rode some kind of vehicle!\nJudge:\nWhat!? A vehicle!? What vehicle?\nKlavier:\nAh, what a novel idea. I like it.\nTrucy:\nHey, that's not a bad guess! Wrong, but not bad!\nApollo:\n(Hah hah, yes, laugh at the dumb attorney. I don't mind.)\nLamiroir:\nAh ha ha. I'm sorry, but the girl is right. That vent was much too small for vehicles.\nLamiroir:\nIt was a tight fit. Even I had to crouch as I walked. I cannot imagine a vehicle that would fit in such a small space.\nApollo:\n(Argh! If it wasn't a vehicle what was it?)\nJudge:\nYou had me going for a while there, Mr. Justice. Too bad! Ready for the next part?\nApollo:\n(Why do I feel like I'm on some kind of quiz show?)Lamiroir:\nThere is an emergency exit in the backstage, where a stagehand waited.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nDid everyone on the concert staff know about the trick?\nLamiroir:\nNot all. Only a few that were needed to help.\nTrucy:\nSee? Like I said, it's on a need-to-know basis.\nApollo:\n(So, not many people knew about the trick...)\nJudge:\nWhat were these stagehands required to do?\nLamiroir:\nOne needed to open the emergency exit. The door to the stairs is locked, but once through there...Lamiroir:\nFrom there, one can enter the forum on the opposite side from the stage.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nSo when you came back out, you were behind the audience.\nLamiroir:\nYes, that is how it worked.\nKlavier:\nNot a bad show, if I do say so myself.\nTrucy:\nThat's Uncle Valant for you! The old Gramarye touch!\nJudge:\nBut on the video, you were only gone for twenty seconds! How is that possible?\nApollo:\n(That's the part I don't get either...)\nLamiroir:\nAh ha ha. Yes, it would be hard to go so far in only twenty seconds...Lamiroir:\nThe plan was for me to move there in two minutes.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nTwo minutes...?\nLamiroir:\nYes. It can be done in one minute, if you are running.\nApollo:\nRunning? In that cramped, dark tunnel above the ceiling?\nLamiroir:\nHa ha, Mr. Attorney. Have you forgotten? Dark or lit, it makes no difference to me.\nApollo:\nAh, that's true, but...\nJudge:\nSo, you're saying that on the night of the concert, you made the trip in two minutes?\nLamiroir:\nYes... though I nearly didn't make it in time. You see... I stopped halfway.\nApollo:\n(Lamiroir disappears on the video for twenty seconds. But she says she made the trip in two minutes! How?)\nTrucy:\nIf you want my professional opinion, I'll bet the answer's right there in that video.\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Justice? Perhaps you have some evidence for us? Something that can explain the discrepancy between the video and her testimony?\nApollo:\nAck! (Evidence explaining the discrepancy...?)\n\n\n\nPresent evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nThere's one piece of evidence that explains the discrepancy between video and testimony!\n\n\n\nPresent Brooch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nLamiroir... do you happen to remember this brooch?\nJudge:\nAh ha! The brooch! We saw that yesterday, did we not?\nApollo:\nIt was found at the scene, Your Honor.\nKlavier:\nAnd you're bringing this up now... why? I thought we had already determined when that was dropped.\nApollo:\nSo did I... but we hadn't.\nKlavier:\n...!\nApollo:\nTake another look at the video... Here, you can see she's wearing the brooch!\nJudge:\nHmm... So she is.\nApollo:\nLet's look a bit later.\nJudge:\nWh-Whaaat? The brooch! It's gone!\nKlavier:\nWhaaat...!?\nApollo:\nYes... the brooch disappeared in the short space of twenty seconds. And it takes a full minute to run from the stage to the backstage... Which means there can be only one explanation. The Lamiroir we see before the vanishing act and the Lamiroir we see after... ...are two different people!\nJudge:\nWha... Whaaaaaaaaaaat!?\nApollo:\nThe brooch was found on the floor at the crime scene. And not just on the floor... ...but on the floor directly beneath the air vent! Lamiroir, tell me... Did you drop the brooch on your way from the stage to the backstage? ...At the very moment you \"witnessed\" the crime?\nLamiroir:\n...Yes, I think I did.\nJudge:\nOrder! P-Prosecutor Gavin!\nKlavier:\n...From your expression, I gather you had no idea this was the case, Herr Judge. I, of course, knew about it.\nJudge:\nWh-What?\nKlavier:\nDon't get me wrong, I wasn't hiding it. It just never occurred to me... ...that the switch and the shooting took place at the same time.\nApollo:\nSo... I was right? There was a switch?\nKlavier:\nThere was. Just before the stage's tower rose, Lamiroir was \"replaced\".\nJudge:\nWhile we're on the subject, just who was this replacement Lamiroir...?\nKlavier:\nWhy, the man behind the illusion. Valant Gramarye.\nApollo:\n(It was Gramarye...!?) That's... quite the illusion. But I still don't get one thing...\nLamiroir:\nYes?\nApollo:\n...The switch happened before the tower rose, correct? So you weren't on the stage!\nLamiroir:\nThat's right.\nApollo:\nBut this, er, fake Lamiroir is still singing! And she's pretty good!\nJudge:\nThat's true!\nTrucy:\nC'mon, Apollo! That's an easy one. They were just playing a recording!\nKlavier:\nAh ha ha... The Gavinners aren't some kind of air guitar band, Fräulein.\nTrucy:\nOh? You mean, I'm wrong?\nKlavier:\nWhen we play a show live, we play live. No recordings. ...Perhaps you can explain, Lamiroir?\nLamiroir:\nVery well...\nJudge:\nYes, do tell! And add it to your testimony.\nChanges statement from \"I was on my way, when I heard the voice.\" to \"I... had to keep singing, even while I moved.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nJudge:\nAh ha! So this is it? The magical key to unlocking this illusion's dark secret!? Tell us how it works! Quickly! I can't bear the suspense!\nApollo:\n(...I was kind of hoping someone else would jump in at this point.) W-Well, you see...\nKlavier:\n\nKlavier:\nHerr Judge, I do hate to spoil the mood... ...but I haven't the faintest idea what he's talking about. And neither does he.\nTrucy:\nI'm a little confused, too, there, Apollo.\nApollo:\n...Right! By which I conclude that... I was wrong.\nTrucy:\nBetter luck next time, Polly-wog!\nJudge:\n...Mr. Justice. I'm holding you responsible for spoiling my mood!\nApollo:\n(Was that a tear I just saw in the judge's eye? ...Alright, nothing to do but rethink this through. The key's in the video somewhere. I'm sure of it!)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's no evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n(What kind of evidence could prove that...?) Um, what's your professional opinion about this one, Trucy?\nTrucy:\nSorry. I don't work in evidence.\nApollo:\nAnd I don't work in tricks! I'm an attorney, not a magician for crying out loud!\nTrucy:\nReally? I'm sure Daddy would have loved working on this.\nApollo:\nThanks, that makes me feel oh so much better.\nJudge:\nWell, I don't know about all of you, but I find this mystery fascinating! And I'm not letting this trial go any further until we get to the bottom of it! The defense will continue with the cross-examination until we have some answers!\nApollo:\n(Easier said than done...)\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after changing fifth statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nAll made possible by the switching trick.\nLamiroir:\nIt was quite a surprise to me at first.

I know what he means!

Useful for knowing when your set is coming up.Klavier:\n...Satisfied? That dressing room was fitted with a large speaker playing a direct feed from the stage. ...At my request, actually.Apollo:\nSo Lamiroir singing in the ceiling... ...sounded just like Lamiroir singing over the speaker.Judge:\nIngenious! Her voice was hidden... by her voice!Lamiroir:\nAh...Apollo:\nLamiroir?Lamiroir:\nI... have just remembered something.Judge:\nDo tell!Lamiroir:\nWhen I heard the noise... the gunshots, yes? It startled me, so I...Apollo:\nSo you...?Lamiroir:\nI stopped singing.Judge:\nWhat...?Lamiroir:\nI forgot the words I was supposed to sing!!Apollo:\n(The song... stopped!?)Lamiroir:\nThankfully, it was the very beginning of the second verse. So not many would notice.Klavier:\nForehead! That mixing board I lent you! Where is it?Apollo:\nThe mixing... huh?Trucy:\nThat machine, Apollo! The one that breaks music into tracks!Apollo:\nOh, this! I'd completely forgotten about it... Let's take a listen!Sugar, Sugar...O that night, in your embrace.\nWhen you stole away the keysmy heart held on to so tight.\n\nPleasure...But a fleeting melodyApollo:\nThe song does stop there!Judge:\nIt does? I must have missed it...Apollo:\nLook at the lyrics sheet, at the top of the second verse. See where it says \"Pleasure, Pleasure...\"? Now listen again!When you stole away the keysmy heart held on to so tight.\nPleasure...But a fleeting melodyJudge:\n...This is evidence indeed! I believe we are guilty of making a terrible mistake.Apollo:\nThe crime didn't happen during the third set. It happened during the second, during Lamiroir's ballad.Judge:\nIf that is true... ...then no one on stage during the second set could have been the shooter!Apollo:\nWhich means that Daryan Crescend could have done it! He wasn't on stage for the second set!Klavier:\n......Apollo:\nWell, Prosecutor Gavin?Klavier:\n...Fascinating.Apollo:\n!Klavier:\nI don't believe I've ever seen a trial turned around quite so thoroughly. ...Yet one problem remains.Judge:\nWhat's that, Prosecutor Gavin?Klavier:\nHerr Forehead's theory does have a certain kind of logic to it. Yet it is entirely based upon Lamiroir's testimony.Judge:\nYes? Is there a problem with that?Klavier:\nWell, it's quite simple, though it pains me to say it. What if she is lying to protect the defendant?Apollo:Apollo:\nBut you have no proof...!Klavier:\nAll I'm saying is that the truth is as yet unclear. ...Until we hear directly from the man himself.Judge:\nThe man... you don't mean!?Klavier:\n...Yes. Though he is a friend, and band member, Daryan Crescend must take the stand. I see no other way.Judge:\nAs... someone with a new perspective on the case?Klavier:\n...As a suspect, to be frank.Apollo:\n(...Finally! The rat's coming out of his hole! And I'm ready to catch him! Daryan Crescend, get ready for Justice!)Judge:\nThis is as good a time as any to pause for a brief recess. The prosecution will summon the witness. Have him here and ready by the time we begin.Klavier:\n...I'm the last man who needs to be reminded of what his duties are.Judge:\nVery well, court is adjourned for a fifteen-minute recess!To be continued.July 10, 1:40 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2Trucy:\nApollo! I can't believe it! It really happened during the second act? A-And right in the middle of Lamiroir's performance!?Apollo:\nThe reason why she was in that air vent... (Changed from [Why she was in that air vent...] in the original release) ...and that \"switch\" and the flaming guitar. When you link it all together, that's what you end up with.???:\n...I knew you had what it took.Trucy:\nAh... Daddy!Apollo:\nMr. Wright! You... believed in me?Phoenix:\nNot really.Apollo:\nHuh?Phoenix:\nI just thought that'd make a cooler entrance than, say, \"hiya\"!Apollo:\n...Why do I even bother hoping?Trucy:\nWhere have you been lately, Daddy? You haven't been coming to the office at all!Phoenix:\nAh, sorry about that, Trucy. I'm on a... secret mission.Trucy:\nSecret? You mean like, you're undercover?Apollo:\nLike Mr. LeTouse, only shorter and not as well dressed.Trucy:\nOh no! What if you're shot, too, Daddy!?Phoenix:\nAh ha ha! Would I do a thing like that to you? Anyway, I'm off for a while again.Apollo:\nHuh? You're leaving?Phoenix:\nOh, one thing before I go.Apollo:\nWhat?Phoenix:\n............... Good luck.Apollo:\n...Right.Phoenix:\n......Apollo:\n...... Um... Is that all you came to say?Phoenix:\n...I think you have things pretty much under control. You'll get Machi Tobaye off the hook, no doubt.Apollo:\nYeah, but...Phoenix:\nBut you're after that detective, aren't you?Apollo:\nDaryan Crescend...Phoenix:\nIt won't be easy proving he did it. Especially not under the current court system...Apollo:\nThe current court system...?Phoenix:\nWhat did Prosecutor Gavin say during the trial? Your case is based on one fragile assumption. ...Namely, that our diva divine is telling the truth.Trucy:\nBut what about all the proof? The brooch... and the switch!Phoenix:\nA piece of jewelry, and a lyrical blunder... There are plenty of other ways to explain these things. The flaming guitar, too. ...All because you lack definitive proof of their connection to the case.Trucy:\nBut...!Phoenix:\nIf the sultry songstress is lying... ...your case melts like butter in a frying pan. Leaving behind the faintly singed scent of failure.Apollo:\nSo what do I do!?Phoenix:\nLike I said. Good luck. And be aware that it will be impossible to prove his guilt by conventional methods.Apollo:\nUgh...Phoenix:\nOh, that reminds me. I have something to give you from our detective friend.Apollo:\nDetective Skye... Ema!?Phoenix:\nLet's see. This bag of snacks here was meant for me... Ah, here it is.Trucy:\nWhat are those, Daddy? They don't look like very good snacking material.Phoenix:\nThey were found at the scene. Analysis of the fragments revealed traces of gunpowder.Trucy:\nGunpowder...!?Phoenix:\nProbably a firecracker or something similar, like the ones kids are into these days. These fragments were found under the sofa at the scene of the crime, actually.Apollo:\nUnder the sofa...Trucy:\nHey, Apollo! That's where we found that little device thingy!Apollo:\nRight... this. (Well, finally, some evidence that makes sense...)Burnt Fragments added to the Court Record.Examine evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBurnt Fragments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFragments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nSo... you think this was some kind of firecracker?\nTrucy:\nYeah, or one of those noisemakers, like you shoot off on New Years!\nApollo:\nDid you know that in China, they use firecrackers on New Years to scare off evil? So, it's kind of same thing.\nTrucy:\nReally!? I had no idea! Well did you know this? It takes more than 500 peanuts to make one 12-ounce jar of peanut butter!\nApollo:\n(At least my useless fact had something to do with the evidence...)Phoenix:\nThat's all for me, I suppose. See you after the verdict. Maybe.Apollo:\nRight...Phoenix:\nEvery man has an igniter inside him.Apollo:\n...Excuse me?Phoenix:\nFind Daryan Crescend's igniter... and set it off.Apollo:\n(And he walked out the door, just like... just like a magician. Normally.)Trucy:\nUhh... What does he want us to do? No \"conventional methods\"? What does that mean?Apollo:\nI guess we just have to take his advice, and hope it makes sense when the time comes.Trucy:\nI guess...Apollo:\n(We're almost at the finish line. Hang in there, Trucy.)July 10, 1:55 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:\n...Court is now back in session. Prosecutor Gavin, where is Detective Crescend?Klavier:\nIn the witness lounge, ready to be called at any time.Judge:\nVery well.Klavier:\nMight I add... I don't believe any of this. He... Daryan was the first detective I ever worked with. We stopped working together when he moved to Criminal Affairs, Division 3... But his guitar playing... it fires my imagination!Apollo:\nThat's nice, but it has nothing to do with the matter at hand. ...Correct?Klavier:\nOh, I know. ...Herr Forehead.Judge:\nVery well, call the final witness to the stand! ...Detective Daryan Crescend!Klavier:\n...Name and occupation, please.Daryan:\nDaryan Crescend. Detective, Criminal Affairs, Division 3. That's the International Affairs Division, for those of you who didn't know. ...And I'm a guitarist for the Gavinners. Maybe you've heard of us?Judge:\nDo you fully understand the circumstances under which you stand before us today?Daryan:\nYeah, I understand, Your Honor. What I don't understand... is how you let this happen, \"partner\".Klavier:\n......Daryan:\nYou gave me your word I wouldn't be standing here.Klavier:\nThe situation's changed, Daryan... And don't call me \"partner\".Daryan:\nFeh. So much for old friends.Klavier:\n......Apollo:\n(I see what you're doing, Daryan. You're \"pressing\" the prosecution!) ...Your Honor, if we could begin the trial?Judge:\nYes, it's high time we did. Let's hear your testimony. You may begin with your response to Lamiroir's testimony. If, in fact you have anything to say about it.Daryan:\nOh I got plenty to say. Lying must be a national pastime in Borginia. ...And wherever you're from, Mr. \"Justice\". Hah!Apollo:\n...... (Conventional methods are out the window, huh... ...Here goes nothing!)Witness Testimony-- Daryan's Rebuttal --Daryan:\nThe diva's lying, plain and simple. She's got nothing to back up her story.\nIn the first place, she never heard my voice!\nShe \"forgot the words because she heard gunshots\"? As if!\nDidn't Detective Ema Skye hear those gunshots during the third set, anyway?\nThe shooting took place when I was on stage, man!Judge:\nHmm... So you claim Lamiroir's testimony was a lie?Daryan:\nHey, don't get me wrong, I dig what she's doing, trying to protect that kid. And she's got the court eating vague statements out of her hand just 'cause she's blind.Klavier:\n...You go too far, Daryan.Daryan:\nLook, all I'm saying is, you've got a reliable witness. Why not listen to the detective?Judge:\nDetective Skye...? Hmm... I see. Mr. Justice, you may begin the cross-examination.Apollo:\n(He didn't waste any time finding our weak spot... I can't do this with Lamiroir's testimony alone. I'll have to find some other way to prove when the shooting took place!)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Daryan's Rebuttal --Daryan:\nThe diva's lying, plain and simple.

You're crazy, man, crazy! An upstanding prosecutor like you even listening to this weak evidence!? Man, you can barely hear that! How do you know it's a gun?\nKlavier:\nPerhaps it is you who are hard of hearing, Daryan. It sounds like a gunshot to me.\nApollo:\nAdmit it! You lost, Detective Crescend!\nDaryan:\nOK, so what about the gunshots Detective Skye heard? You heard 'em, too, didn't you? Don't even think about telling me you were \"mistaken\"!\nJudge:\nWere you thinking of telling him that, Mr. Justice?\nApollo:\nNo, Your Honor. Detective Skye and I clearly heard what sounded like gunshots.

And... one more thing.\nJudge:\nWhat are those? The remains of something burnt? Not another guitar, I hope!?\nKlavier:\nTraces of gunpowder were found on these fragments. We have a report that it was something like a firecracker.\nApollo:\nEh... (How did Gavin know about this...?)\nKlavier:\nWhat? You think Detective Skye works for you? I received the report this morning, before coming here. That's when I made my decision, actually.\nJudge:\nWhat decision is this, Prosecutor Gavin?\nKlavier:\nI registered Daryan as a witness in today's trial. ...Just in case.\nDaryan:\n......\nApollo:\nThis raises another possibility. Those gunshot-like sounds during the third set... ...could have been two firecrackers rigged to go off by remote control!\nDaryan:\nHa ha! You got an active imagination, don't you? But you shouldn't say every little thing you think. Your explanation there seems a bit too convenient to me.\nApollo:\nHow so?\nDaryan:\nSo, you're saying these firecrackers just happened to go off... ...right when two witnesses came walking by? Hah!\nApollo:\n...!\nTrucy:\nThat's right! Daryan was out on stage when it happened, Apollo! How would he know someone was backstage right then!?\nDaryan:\nIf a firecracker goes off in the forest, and there's no one there to hear... You get my drift! Why go through the trouble, man!?\nApollo:\nUrk...! (How do I explain this...?)\nKlavier:\n...He may not look it, but Daryan is a gifted detective. Show any weakness, and he's sure to find it.\nDaryan:\n\"He may not look it\", partner? Gee, thanks, man.\nKlavier:\n...That reminds me. I happened to pass through that very hallway several times that day myself. And I saw something odd there just before the third set.\nApollo:\nSomething... odd?\nKlavier:\nA headset. The kind all of the band and staff members were wearing.\nApollo:\n...! (That's right! We picked this up in front of the door to that dressing room!)\nKlavier:\nWhat if that headset wasn't dropped, but placed? And what if it was turned on?\nApollo:\nYou could hear what was going on in that hallway! Even if you were out on stage!\nDaryan:\nFeh... Whose side are you on, Gavin?\nKlavier:\nListen to me, Daryan. There are no sides in a court of law.\nDaryan:\n......\nKlavier:\nIn any case...\nLeads to:\n\"I believe a case has been made.\"Daryan:\nIn the first place, she never heard my voice!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nYou never talked to her, even though you were playing in the same concert?\nDaryan:\nNot a word, as far as I can recall.\nApollo:\nBut, weren't there planning sessions or something?\nDaryan:\nGavin took care of all that himself.\nKlavier:\n...Daryan wasn't involved in any of the meetings with her.\nApollo:\nUgh...\nDaryan:\nAs if you can just go around remembering everyone's voice like that anyway. Only an idiot would believe that!\nApollo:\n(Lamiroir's hearing is very sensitive... She could remember him if she heard him, I'm sure of it... I just can't prove it. And I need proof!)Daryan:\nShe \"forgot the words because she heard gunshots\"? As if!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nWe know she missed the words. The mixing board proved it!\nDaryan:\nOh, yeah, there was a mistake. But blaming it on gunshots is just a lame excuse.\nApollo:\nWhat do you mean...?\nDaryan:\nThe mixing board proves what? It proves there was a mistake in the song. A missed cue. So? She just flubbed it up, big time. That's all. She spins this story about a gunshot to protect the kid... and cover for her own goof. Man, I'd have to hand it to her... if she wasn't sticking it to me at the same time.\nKlavier:\n...Daryan, watch what you say. Lamiroir is an artist. She \"just flubbed it up\"? That's no small accusation for a performer of her caliber.\nDaryan:\nHeh. She got to you, alright. I can see it in your eyes. I tell you, most of her stuff is so pretentious, it's way over my head.\nApollo:\n(I'm detecting a rift in the Gavinners's ranks.)\nDaryan:\nAnyway, she's too close to the defendant.

Those gunshot-like sounds during the third set... ...could have been two firecrackers rigged to go off by remote control!\nDaryan:\nHa ha! You got an active imagination, don't you? But you shouldn't say every little thing you think. Your explanation there seems a bit too convenient to me.\nApollo:\nHow so?\nDaryan:\nSo, you're saying these firecrackers just happened to go off... ...right when two witnesses came walking by? Hah!\nApollo:\n...!\nTrucy:\nThat's right! Daryan was out on stage when it happened, Apollo! How would he know someone was backstage right then!?\nDaryan:\nIf a firecracker goes off in the forest, and there's no one there to hear... You get my drift! Why go through the trouble, man!?\nApollo:\nUrk...! (How do I explain this...?)\nKlavier:\n...He may not look it, but Daryan is a gifted detective. Show any weakness, and he's sure to find it.\nDaryan:\n\"He may not look it\", partner? Gee, thanks, man.\nKlavier:\n...That reminds me. I happened to pass through that very hallway several times that day myself. And I saw something odd there just before the third set.\nApollo:\nSomething... odd?\nKlavier:\nA headset. The kind all of the band and staff members were wearing.\nApollo:\n...! (That's right! We picked this up in front of the door to that dressing room!)\nKlavier:\nWhat if that headset wasn't dropped, but placed? And what if it was turned on?\nApollo:\nYou could hear what was going on in that hallway! Even if you were out on stage!\nDaryan:\nFeh... Whose side are you on, Gavin?\nKlavier:\nListen to me, Daryan. There are no sides in a court of law.\nDaryan:\n......\nKlavier:\nIn any case...\nLeads to:\n\"I believe a case has been made.\"Daryan:\nDidn't Detective Ema Skye hear those gunshots during the third set, anyway?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nActually... I was there, too.\nDaryan:\nSo I hear. Which means you heard them, too, right? The gunshots.\nApollo:\nYes. We heard \"gunshots\". Neither I nor Ema actually saw the shooting, mind you.\nDaryan:\n...... Heh. I guess you and Lamiroir got the same excuse then.\nKlavier:\nWe know one thing for certain here. There were gunshot-like sounds that emanated from that room during the third set. What we must determine is whether those sounds were actually gunshots.\nTrucy:\nMachi heard them, too! Remember he said he ran for the air duct when he heard them?\nApollo:\n(So... how do we figure out just what those \"gunshots\" during the third set were?)Present Igniter or Burnt Fragments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nSome things were found at the crime scene after yesterday's trial.\nJudge:\nWhat things?\nApollo:\nThe first was this small device...\nKlavier:\n...That's the remote-triggered igniter.\nApollo:\nCorrect. And... one more thing.\nJudge:\nWhat are those? The remains of something burnt? Not another guitar, I hope!?\nKlavier:\nTraces of gunpowder were found on these fragments. We have a report that it was something like a firecracker.\nApollo:\nEh... (How did Gavin know about this...?)\nKlavier:\nWhat? You think Detective Skye works for you? I received the report this morning, before coming here. That's when I made my decision, actually.\nJudge:\nWhat decision is this, Prosecutor Gavin?\nKlavier:\nI registered Daryan as a witness in today's trial. ...Just in case.\nDaryan:\n......\nApollo:\nThis raises another possibility. Those gunshot-like sounds during the third set... ...could have been two firecrackers rigged to go off by remote control!\nDaryan:\nHa ha! You got an active imagination, don't you? But you shouldn't say every little thing you think. Your explanation there seems a bit too convenient to me.\nApollo:\nHow so?\nDaryan:\nSo, you're saying these firecrackers just happened to go off... ...right when two witnesses came walking by? Hah!\nApollo:\n...!\nTrucy:\nThat's right! Daryan was out on stage when it happened, Apollo! How would he know someone was backstage right then!?\nDaryan:\nIf a firecracker goes off in the forest, and there's no one there to hear... You get my drift! Why go through the trouble, man!?\nApollo:\nUrk...! (How do I explain this...?)\nKlavier:\n...He may not look it, but Daryan is a gifted detective.

And what if it was turned on?\nApollo:\nYou could hear what was going on in that hallway! Even if you were out on stage!\nDaryan:\nFeh... Whose side are you on, Gavin?\nKlavier:\nListen to me, Daryan. There are no sides in a court of law.\nDaryan:\n......\nKlavier:\nWhich is why I now turn to you, Herr Forehead. I've a question for you.\nApollo:\nHuh? For me...?\nKlavier:\nThe igniter and the burnt fragments that were found at the scene of the crime... It's certainly a possibility that they were part of a ruse to fake the sound of gunshots. Throw the headset from the hallway into the mix, and you could fabricate an alibi. But we're still no closer to proving anything. Those gunshots might have been real, or fake. We can't say.\nApollo:\nUgh...\nKlavier:\nYou've raised the possibility that the shots heard during the third set were faked. Now you need to prove the other half of the case.\nApollo:\nThe other half...?\nDaryan:\nLook, I'll just tell him.\nApollo:\n!\nDaryan:\nHe wants you to prove the thing went down in the second act... ...while our little piano player was on stage. That right, Gavin?\nKlavier:\nIndeed. If you can't prove that... ...then to continue this cross-examination would be pointless.\nJudge:\nHmm... Well, Mr. Justice? Can you prove the crime took place during the second set?\nApollo:\nUh... Yeah, I think...\nTrucy:\nYou'd better know, Apollo! Otherwise we're through...\nApollo:\nIt can be proven!\nKlavier:\n...You make it sound like someone else is going to come along and do it for you.\nJudge:\nLet's continue with the cross-examination then, shall we? Witness, your testimony, if you would.\nApollo:\n(This isn't going to be easy. I need some decisive proof, and fast...)\nDaryan:\nHeh... You ready, kid? 'Cause I am.\nChanges statement from \"Didn't Detective Ema Skye hear those gunshots during the third set, anyway?\" to \"The shooting took place during the second set? If you're so sure, let's see your proof.\"\nRemoves statement \"The shooting took place when I was on stage, man!\"Daryan:\nThe shooting took place when I was on stage, man!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nThat could have been what the shooter wanted us to think!\nDaryan:\nI'll tell you what the shooter, that kid, wants you to think. He wants you to think the diva heard me in that room.\nApollo:\n(Ack! I'm back to relying on Lamiroir's testimony!)\nKlavier:\nAs much as I'm enjoying the Daryan & Forehead show, there is no need for such tempers.\nApollo:\nDon't make us into some comedy duo.\nDaryan:\nThis mean the Gavin & Daryan show's cancelled?\nKlavier:\nNeither of your claims can be proven... or disproved. We could argue for days like this and get nowhere.\nJudge:\nProsecutor Gavin is quite right. This court will hear no further discussion on this topic without new facts.\nApollo:\n(New facts, huh...?)Present Mixing Board\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nRemember this, Detective Crescend?\nDaryan:\n...The mixing board? What about it!?\nApollo:\n...It seems there was clear proof left behind. ...Right here in Lamiroir's song.\nDaryan:\nHer song...!?\nJudge:\nWhat exactly is this, erm, device thingy? A new variety of gramophone, perhaps?\nApollo:\n(C'mon, we just used this! And don't get me started on \"gramophone\"!) This device was used to record the performance part by part.\nJudge:\nPart...?\nKlavier:\nYou move the sliders to adjust the volume. Each instrument is adjustable separately. Lamiroir's voice included.\nJudge:\nHo hoh! ...But what does this prove?\nApollo:\nAccording to Lamiroir's testimony... At the moment of the shooting, she forgot the words to the song.\nKlavier:\nAh... You intend to examine the recording at that moment, ja? We might even hear those gunshots!\nApollo:\n...Exactly.\nDaryan:\nHah! Ridiculous. How are you supposed to hear gunshots back in that dressing room out on stage?\nKlavier:\nHave you forgotten, Daryan? We were all wearing these headsets.\nDaryan:\nOh...\nKlavier:\nWe were all deeply involved in our performance... ...but Lamiroir's headset would've picked up what she heard all the same.\nJudge:\nThen let's get to analyzing that recording! ...Right now!\nApollo:\n(Lamiroir stopped singing when she heard the shots fired... Find that spot, and I'll find the gunshots!)\n\n\n\nPresent part 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor! Listen closely to this part!\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent any other part\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nYour Honor! Listen to this part!\nJudge:\nWh-What's this!? ...... I hear nothing! How is this possible!?\nApollo:\n(Wait, isn't the judge hard of hearing?)\nJudge:\nI can hear just fine, thank you very much!\nApollo:\n(Ack! He heard me thinking!)\nJudge:\nI saw what you were thinking on your face.\nKlavier:\nHerr Judge's hearing aside, I, too, heard nothing. ...Leading me to believe there is nothing there to be heard.\nApollo:\n(Ugh... I guess that's the wrong spot.)\nJudge:\nA penalty, on behalf of all who are hearing-impaired, you insensitive braggart! Enjoy!\nApollo:\nUgh...\nJudge:\nMr. Justice! Once more, if you would!\nLeads back to:\n\"Lamiroir stopped singing when she heard the shots fired...\"\n\n\nApollo:\nYour Honor! Listen closely to this part! This is the track with Lamiroir's vocals!\n\n\nWhen you stole away the keysmy heart held on to so tight.\nPleasure...\n\nJudge:\n...I did hear something faintly there, yes! Why... it sounded like a gunshot!\nDaryan:\nWh-What!? This has to be some kind of mistake!\nKlavier:\nOr... the sound was coming over the headset along with her voice.\nDaryan:\nGavin... You're crazy, man, crazy! An upstanding prosecutor like you even listening to this weak evidence!? Man, you can barely hear that! How do you know it's a gun?\nKlavier:\nPerhaps it is you who are hard of hearing, Daryan. It sounds like a gunshot to me.\nApollo:\nAdmit it! You lost, Detective Crescend!\nDaryan:\nOK, so what about the gunshots Detective Skye heard? You heard 'em, too, didn't you? Don't even think about telling me you were \"mistaken\"!\nJudge:\nWere you thinking of telling him that, Mr. Justice?\nApollo:\nNo, Your Honor. Detective Skye and I clearly heard what sounded like gunshots. But... they weren't!\nJudge:\nWh-What!?\nApollo:\nAnd I have evidence that proves it!\nDaryan:\n......\nKlavier:\nThen I think you'd best show it to the court. Let's see this evidence!\nJudge:\nIf you would, Mr. Justice!\nApollo:\nThe evidence showing what we really heard... is this!\n\n\n\nPresent Igniter or Burnt Fragments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Some things were found at the crime scene after yesterday's trial.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nThis is your \"gunshot\"!\nJudge:\n...That's your answer?\nKlavier:\nAnd I had such high hopes for you, Herr Forehead...\nJudge:\nI'm having trouble understanding how that piece of evidence is a gunshot... Next you'll be throwing pie plates in the air and calling them UFOs!\nApollo:\n(Even I wouldn't stoop quite that low...) S-Sorry, Your Honor. One more time, please?\nKlavier:\nWhy not. And... get it right this time, hmm?\nLeads back to:\n\"If you would, Mr. Justice!\"\n\n\nApollo:\nSome things were found at the crime scene after yesterday's trial.\nJudge:\nWhat things?\nApollo:\nThe first was this small device...\nKlavier:\n...That's the remote-triggered igniter.\nApollo:\nCorrect.

I've heard that one before.\nApollo:\nUh...\nTrucy:\nWe need proof, Apollo! We need to prove that the shooting took place during the second set!\nApollo:\nWell, if you know how to do that, I'm all ears.\nTrucy:\nMaybe the gunshots are the key after all!\nApollo:\nWhat do you mean?\nTrucy:\nWell, Lamiroir said she heard them, right? Right in the middle of her illusion, when she was up above the ceiling.\nApollo:\n...When she forgot the words to the song, yeah.\nTrucy:\nIf you can prove the gun was shot right when she missed those lyrics... ...we're home free, I'd think.\nApollo:\nTrue... Not easy, but true... (Is there some way to prove that...?)\nTrucy:\nLet's take a look through our evidence! Maybe there's something in there...\nDaryan:\n...Hey, aren't you supposed to be cross-examining me?\nJudge:\nTry to refrain from private discussions during cross-examination, Mr. Justice.\nApollo:\nEr, right, Your Honor!

Why... it sounded like a gunshot!\nDaryan:\nWh-What!? This has to be some kind of mistake!\nKlavier:\nOr... the sound was coming over the headset along with her voice.\nDaryan:\nGavin... You're crazy, man, crazy! An upstanding prosecutor like you even listening to this weak evidence!? Man, you can barely hear that! How do you know it's a gun?\nKlavier:\nPerhaps it is you who are hard of hearing, Daryan. It sounds like a gunshot to me.\nApollo:\nAdmit it! You lost, Detective Crescend!\nDaryan:\nOK, so what about the gunshots Detective Skye heard? You heard 'em, too, didn't you? Don't even think about telling me you were \"mistaken\"!\nJudge:\nWere you thinking of telling him that, Mr. Justice?\nApollo:\nNo, Your Honor. Detective Skye and I clearly heard what sounded like gunshots. But... they weren't!\nJudge:\nWh-What!?\nApollo:\nAnd I have evidence that proves it!\nDaryan:\n......\nKlavier:\nThen I think you'd best show it to the court. Let's see this evidence!\nJudge:\nIf you would, Mr. Justice!\nApollo:\nThe evidence showing what we really heard... is this!\n\n\n\nPresent Igniter or Burnt Fragments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Some things were found at the crime scene after yesterday's trial.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nThis is your \"gunshot\"!\nJudge:\n...That's your answer?\nKlavier:\nAnd I had such high hopes for you, Herr Forehead...\nJudge:\nI'm having trouble understanding how that piece of evidence is a gunshot... Next you'll be throwing pie plates in the air and calling them UFOs!\nApollo:\n(Even I wouldn't stoop quite that low...) S-Sorry, Your Honor. One more time, please?\nKlavier:\nWhy not. And... get it right this time, hmm?\nLeads back to:\n\"If you would, Mr. Justice!\"\n\n\nApollo:\nSome things were found at the crime scene after yesterday's trial.\nJudge:\nWhat things?\nApollo:\nThe first was this small device...\nKlavier:\n...That's the remote-triggered igniter.\nApollo:\nCorrect. And... one more thing.\nJudge:\nWhat are those? The remains of something burnt? Not another guitar, I hope!?\nKlavier:\nTraces of gunpowder were found on these fragments. We have a report that it was something like a firecracker.\nApollo:\nEh... (How did Gavin know about this...?)\nKlavier:\nWhat? You think Detective Skye works for you? I received the report this morning, before coming here. That's when I made my decision, actually.\nJudge:\nWhat decision is this, Prosecutor Gavin?\nKlavier:\nI registered Daryan as a witness in today's trial. ...Just in case.\nDaryan:\n......\nApollo:\nThis raises another possibility. Those gunshot-like sounds during the third set... ...could have been two firecrackers rigged to go off by remote control!\nDaryan:\nHa ha! You got an active imagination, don't you? But you shouldn't say every little thing you think. Your explanation there seems a bit too convenient to me.\nApollo:\nHow so?\nDaryan:\nSo, you're saying these firecrackers just happened to go off... ...right when two witnesses came walking by? Hah!\nApollo:\n...!\nTrucy:\nThat's right! Daryan was out on stage when it happened, Apollo! How would he know someone was backstage right then!?\nDaryan:\nIf a firecracker goes off in the forest, and there's no one there to hear... You get my drift! Why go through the trouble, man!?\nApollo:\nUrk...! (How do I explain this...?)\nKlavier:\n...He may not look it, but Daryan is a gifted detective. Show any weakness, and he's sure to find it.\nDaryan:\n\"He may not look it\", partner? Gee, thanks, man.\nKlavier:\n...That reminds me. I happened to pass through that very hallway several times that day myself. And I saw something odd there just before the third set.\nApollo:\nSomething... odd?\nKlavier:\nA headset. The kind all of the band and staff members were wearing.\nApollo:\n...! (That's right! We picked this up in front of the door to that dressing room!)\nKlavier:\nWhat if that headset wasn't dropped, but placed? And what if it was turned on?\nApollo:\nYou could hear what was going on in that hallway! Even if you were out on stage!\nDaryan:\nFeh... Whose side are you on, Gavin?\nKlavier:\nListen to me, Daryan. There are no sides in a court of law.\nDaryan:\n......\nKlavier:\nIn any case...\nLeads to:\n\"I believe a case has been made.\"Daryan:\nIn the first place, she never heard my voice!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nYou never talked to her, even though you were playing in the same concert?\nDaryan:\nNot a word, as far as I can recall.\nApollo:\nBut, weren't there planning sessions or something?\nDaryan:\nGavin took care of all that himself.\nKlavier:\n...Daryan wasn't involved in any of the meetings with her.\nApollo:\nUgh...\nDaryan:\nAs if you can just go around remembering everyone's voice like that anyway. Only an idiot would believe that!\nApollo:\n(Lamiroir's hearing is very sensitive... She could remember him if she heard him, I'm sure of it... I just can't prove it. And I need proof!)Daryan:\nShe \"forgot the words because she heard gunshots\"? As if!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nWe know she missed the words. The mixing board proved it!\nDaryan:\nOh, yeah, there was a mistake. But blaming it on gunshots is just a lame excuse.\nApollo:\nWhat do you mean...?\nDaryan:\nThe mixing board proves what? It proves there was a mistake in the song. A missed cue. So? She just flubbed it up, big time. That's all. She spins this story about a gunshot to protect the kid... and cover for her own goof. Man, I'd have to hand it to her... if she wasn't sticking it to me at the same time.\nKlavier:\n...Daryan, watch what you say. Lamiroir is an artist. She \"just flubbed it up\"? That's no small accusation for a performer of her caliber.\nDaryan:\nHeh. She got to you, alright. I can see it in your eyes. I tell you, most of her stuff is so pretentious, it's way over my head.\nApollo:\n(I'm detecting a rift in the Gavinners's ranks.)\nDaryan:\nAnyway, she's too close to the defendant. Her testimony can't be trusted. You ask me, I'd go with Detective Skye's story at the drop of a pick.Present Mixing Board (if Igniter or Burnt Fragments was presented on fourth statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\n...It seems there was clear proof left behind. ...Right here in Lamiroir's song.\nDaryan:\nHer song...!?\nJudge:\nWhat exactly is this, erm, device thingy?

At the moment of the shooting, she forgot the words to the song.\nKlavier:\nAh... You intend to examine the recording at that moment, ja? We might even hear those gunshots!\nApollo:\n...Exactly.\nDaryan:\nHah! Ridiculous. How are you supposed to hear gunshots back in that dressing room out on stage?\nKlavier:\nHave you forgotten, Daryan?

I was there, too.\nDaryan:\nSo I hear. Which means you heard them, too, right? The gunshots.\nApollo:\nYes. We heard \"gunshots\". Neither I nor Ema actually saw the shooting, mind you.\nDaryan:\n...... Heh. I guess you and Lamiroir got the same excuse then.\nKlavier:\nWe know one thing for certain here. There were gunshot-like sounds that emanated from that room during the third set. What we must determine is whether those sounds were actually gunshots.\nTrucy:\nMachi heard them, too!

I've a question for you.\nApollo:\nHuh? For me...?\nKlavier:\nThe igniter and the burnt fragments that were found at the scene of the crime... It's certainly a possibility that they were part of a ruse to fake the sound of gunshots. Throw the headset from the hallway into the mix, and you could fabricate an alibi. But we're still no closer to proving anything. Those gunshots might have been real, or fake. We can't say.\nApollo:\nUgh...\nKlavier:\nYou've raised the possibility that the shots heard during the third set were faked. Now you need to prove the other half of the case.\nApollo:\nThe other half...?\nDaryan:\nLook, I'll just tell him.\nApollo:\n!\nDaryan:\nHe wants you to prove the thing went down in the second act... ...while our little piano player was on stage. That right, Gavin?\nKlavier:\nIndeed. If you can't prove that... ...then to continue this cross-examination would be pointless.\nJudge:\nHmm... Well, Mr. Justice? Can you prove the crime took place during the second set?\nApollo:\nUh... Yeah, I think...\nTrucy:\nYou'd better know, Apollo! Otherwise we're through...\nApollo:\nIt can be proven!\nKlavier:\n...You make it sound like someone else is going to come along and do it for you.\nJudge:\nLet's continue with the cross-examination then, shall we?

'Cause I am.\nChanges statement from \"Didn't Detective Ema Skye hear those gunshots during the third set, anyway?\" to \"The shooting took place during the second set?

He wants you to think the diva heard me in that room.\nApollo:\n(Ack! I'm back to relying on Lamiroir's testimony!)\nKlavier:\nAs much as I'm enjoying the Daryan & Forehead show, there is no need for such tempers.\nApollo:\nDon't make us into some comedy duo.\nDaryan:\nThis mean the Gavin & Daryan show's cancelled?\nKlavier:\nNeither of your claims can be proven... or disproved. We could argue for days like this and get nowhere.\nJudge:\nProsecutor Gavin is quite right. This court will hear no further discussion on this topic without new facts.\nApollo:\n(New facts, huh...?)Present Mixing Board\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nRemember this, Detective Crescend?\nDaryan:\n...The mixing board?

Why go through the trouble, man!?\nApollo:\nUrk...! (How do I explain this...?)\nKlavier:\n...He may not look it, but Daryan is a gifted detective. Show any weakness, and he's sure to find it.\nDaryan:\n\"He may not look it\", partner? Gee, thanks, man.\nKlavier:\n...That reminds me. I happened to pass through that very hallway several times that day myself. And I saw something odd there just before the third set.\nApollo:\nSomething... odd?\nKlavier:\nA headset. The kind all of the band and staff members were wearing.\nApollo:\n...! (That's right! We picked this up in front of the door to that dressing room!)\nKlavier:\nWhat if that headset wasn't dropped, but placed? And what if it was turned on?\nApollo:\nYou could hear what was going on in that hallway! Even if you were out on stage!\nDaryan:\nFeh... Whose side are you on, Gavin?\nKlavier:\nListen to me, Daryan. There are no sides in a court of law.\nDaryan:\n......\nKlavier:\nIn any case...\nLeads to:\n\"I believe a case has been made.\"Daryan:\nThe shooting took place during the second set? If you're so sure, let's see your proof.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nBut the \"gunshots\" heard during the third set could have been...\nDaryan:\nWhat? Some kind of set up? I've heard that one before.\nApollo:\nUh...\nTrucy:\nWe need proof, Apollo! We need to prove that the shooting took place during the second set!\nApollo:\nWell, if you know how to do that, I'm all ears.\nTrucy:\nMaybe the gunshots are the key after all!\nApollo:\nWhat do you mean?\nTrucy:\nWell, Lamiroir said she heard them, right? Right in the middle of her illusion, when she was up above the ceiling.\nApollo:\n...When she forgot the words to the song, yeah.\nTrucy:\nIf you can prove the gun was shot right when she missed those lyrics... ...we're home free, I'd think.\nApollo:\nTrue... Not easy, but true... (Is there some way to prove that...?)\nTrucy:\nLet's take a look through our evidence! Maybe there's something in there...\nDaryan:\n...Hey, aren't you supposed to be cross-examining me?\nJudge:\nTry to refrain from private discussions during cross-examination, Mr. Justice.\nApollo:\nEr, right, Your Honor! Sorry! (Just let me take a quick look through the Court Record...)Present Mixing Board\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\n...It seems there was clear proof left behind. ...Right here in Lamiroir's song.\nDaryan:\nHer song...!?\nJudge:\nWhat exactly is this, erm, device thingy? A new variety of gramophone, perhaps?\nApollo:\n(C'mon, we just used this! And don't get me started on \"gramophone\"!) This device was used to record the performance part by part.\nJudge:\nPart...?\nKlavier:\nYou move the sliders to adjust the volume. Each instrument is adjustable separately. Lamiroir's voice included.\nJudge:\nHo hoh! ...But what does this prove?\nApollo:\nAccording to Lamiroir's testimony... At the moment of the shooting, she forgot the words to the song.\nKlavier:\nAh... You intend to examine the recording at that moment, ja? We might even hear those gunshots!\nApollo:\n...Exactly.\nDaryan:\nHah! Ridiculous. How are you supposed to hear gunshots back in that dressing room out on stage?\nKlavier:\nHave you forgotten, Daryan? We were all wearing these headsets.\nDaryan:\nOh...\nKlavier:\nWe were all deeply involved in our performance... ...but Lamiroir's headset would've picked up what she heard all the same.\nJudge:\nThen let's get to analyzing that recording! ...Right now!\nApollo:\n(Lamiroir stopped singing when she heard the shots fired... Find that spot, and I'll find the gunshots!)\n\n\n\nPresent part 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor! Listen closely to this part!\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent any other part\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nYour Honor! Listen to this part!\nJudge:\nWh-What's this!? ...... I hear nothing! How is this possible!?\nApollo:\n(Wait, isn't the judge hard of hearing?)\nJudge:\nI can hear just fine, thank you very much!\nApollo:\n(Ack! He heard me thinking!)\nJudge:\nI saw what you were thinking on your face.\nKlavier:\nHerr Judge's hearing aside, I, too, heard nothing. ...Leading me to believe there is nothing there to be heard.\nApollo:\n(Ugh... I guess that's the wrong spot.)\nJudge:\nA penalty, on behalf of all who are hearing-impaired, you insensitive braggart! Enjoy!\nApollo:\nUgh...\nJudge:\nMr. Justice! Once more, if you would!\nLeads back to:\n\"Lamiroir stopped singing when she heard the shots fired...\"\n\n\nApollo:\nYour Honor! Listen closely to this part! This is the track with Lamiroir's vocals!\n\n\nWhen you stole away the keysmy heart held on to so tight.\nPleasure...\n\nJudge:\n...I did hear something faintly there, yes! Why... it sounded like a gunshot!\nDaryan:\nWh-What!? This has to be some kind of mistake!\nLeads to:\n\"I believe a case has been made.\"Trucy:\nHe's pretty eager to paint Lamiroir as a liar, isn't he?Apollo:\nYeah, because her testimony is basically our entire case.Trucy:\nHmm... This is tough. So, what do we do?Apollo:\n...I've got a few ideas. (I just need to find another way to prove it didn't happen when he says it did!)Klavier:\nI believe a case has been made. Gunshots were heard during the second set. Which means Lamiroir's testimony... was true.Daryan:\n...Grah!Judge:\nOrder! So... she was telling the truth about what she heard?Lamiroir:\nIt was the other man speaking, not Mr. LeTouse.Judge:\nWell, what did he say!?Lamiroir:\n\"It's over. Press the switch! Now!\"Apollo:\nJust after that, there was a gunshot... and then the guitar caught on fire.Klavier:\nDetective Crescend... You weren't on stage during the second set. You could have done it.Judge:\nHmm... But why did we only hear one gunshot on the recording? Weren't two bullets fired from this weapon?Apollo:\nLamiroir was moving through the air vent, Your Honor. She must not have been close enough for her mic to catch the first shot. But then, as she passed over the dressing room... ...the gun fired again, and Mr. LeTouse's life was taken. Well, Detective Crescend?Daryan:\n......Klavier:\nAh, once again I am reminded of something.Apollo:\n...?Klavier:\nOur performance that day...Judge:\nYour performance?Klavier:\nSeeing the mixing board jogged my memory. You were there, too, Herr Forehead.Klavier:\nWhat is it with today!? Problem after problem! Achtung! My hog won't start. My guitar case is busted... ...my guitar's been burnt to a crisp, and to top it all off, someone's dead! ...And then there was that performance just now. What was that all about!?Apollo:\nThis part is off.Klavier:\nWhich is that? Hmm... 2nd Guitar.Daryan:\nAh.Klavier:\nIt was you Daryan!Klavier:\n...I thought it strange at the time. How could you miss such a simple cue? I know you, I know how you play. You're better than that.Daryan:\nYeah, well, I...Judge:\nYou what? And Prosecutor Gavin, what are you getting at?Klavier:\nI'm talking about the murder weapon. Mr. LeTouse's 45-caliber hand cannon. As we have learned, even the shooter doesn't go unscarred with a revolver that size. The kickback is enough to dislocate your shoulder, if you're an amateur.Apollo:\nWait...! You mean his playing was affected because he hurt himself shooting that revolver?Daryan:\nHah! You're forgetting something.Judge:\nYes, Detective Crescend...?Daryan:\nI am a trained police officer, you know. I've had firearms training. Plenty of it. I'm no amateur.Klavier:\nThe standard sidearm issued to police officers is a 38-caliber weapon. A much tamer beast. Also, the murder weapon belonged to the victim, Mr. LeTouse. ...Which suggests there was a struggle between killer and victim.Judge:\nSo... the killer might not have been holding the revolver correctly when he fired! Is that what you mean!?Klavier:\n...The thought had occurred to me, yes.Judge:\nWell, does the witness have anything to say to this?Daryan:\n......Judge:\nDetective Crescend!!!Daryan:\nWhat I want to ask is what Mr. Sleeves-rolled-up-ready-for-action has to say. Hey, you. Attorney.Apollo:\nMe?Daryan:\nExactly which piece of your evidence is decisive, again? You got a little noise on a tape that could be anything. And you have an alleged guitar cue miss due to a 45-caliber kickback. I weep for this case, Gavin, I really do.Klavier:\n......Daryan:\nYou can line up your little weak pieces of evidence all you want. I didn't shoot that manager. And that's the obvious truth.Judge:\nHmm... The witness has a point. The defense's arguments, while persuasive, are not decisive. I believe we should hear what the witness has to say in response to the case so far. ...Your testimony, please, Detective Crescend. Tell us your reasons why you couldn't have done it!Witness Testimony-- Proof of Innocence --Daryan:\nC'mon! Why would I even want to kill that manager?\nYou want a reason? Easy. I got no motive, man!\nThis was that diva's first trip to this country, right?\nHow could I possibly know her manager?\nIf I didn't know him, why would I want to kill him!?Judge:\nHmm. A simple reason, indeed. Prosecutor Gavin. Is it the case that Mr. LeTouse had not been to our country before?Klavier:\nAccording to our records... Yes. Not even once.Judge:\nI see... Very well! Mr. Justice, you may begin the cross-examination.Apollo:\n(Great, now I need to find a motive...)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Proof of Innocence --Daryan:\nC'mon!

Is it one of those silky cocoons? The kind that you can make, well, silk out of?Apollo:\n...Not this one. This cocoon makes a powerful \"curative\".Judge:\nA curative?

I'm embarrassed to admit it, but I'd never heard of them.\nApollo:\nWell, Lamiroir knew about them, though not their use.\nKlavier:\nMy reports indicate that there are ongoing efforts to control information about the cocoons. Most people only know they're illegal to export, that's all.\nJudge:\nThen...

The Chief Justice would never deal in contraband!\nApollo:\n...Not even to save his own son's life?\nJudge:\n...! But, even if the deal went through... Why it'd be an international scandal!\nApollo:\nThat's Detective Crescend's insurance! If word ever got out, the one with his neck on the line... ...would be the Chief Justice!\nDaryan:\n......\nJudge:\nDetective Crescend! Is this true!?\nDaryan:\nFirst I'm a murderer, now I'm a smuggler...? How many crimes are you trying to pin on me, anyway?\nJudge:\nDistasteful as it is to think about, if the Chief Justice were the buyer... ...why, a seller couldn't hope for a better deal. A very cowardly seller!\nDaryan:\nDon't let Sleeves over there trick you. So I made a deal with the Chief Justice? Where's your proof!?\nApollo:\nW-Well...\nDaryan:\nOh yeah, and you're forgetting one other important thing.\nApollo:\n...Do tell.\nDaryan:\nInterpol isn't the only ones out there watching this. Borginian Customs barely sleeps, they're so worried about cocoons getting out.\nJudge:\nHmm... So we were informed. Let's continue with the cross-examination.\nChanges statement from \"Can't sell 'em on the black market. Too dangerous.\" to \"Borginian Customs is very thorough. Everything and everyone gets checked.\"\nChanges statement from \"Yeah, cocoon smuggling ain't exactly lucrative anymore.\" to \"Cocoon possession will get you arrested on the spot, and then sentenced to death.\"\nChanges statement from \"Man, I'm in International Affairs! I know the deal!\" to \"Hey, man, if there's a way to get cocoons out of there, I'd sure like to know.\"Daryan:\nCocoon possession will get you arrested on the spot, and then sentenced to death.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nTh-That's pretty extreme.\nDaryan:\nBorginia has this rep as an idyllic, laid back place. Truth is, they're beyond hard core with security.\nKlavier:\nThe Republic of Borginia is a peaceful, pleasant country. So this level of security shows us how truly concerned they are about these cocoons.\nDaryan:\nThat's the situation...Daryan:\nMan, I'm in International Affairs! I know the deal!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nWhich is why you'd know how to find a loophole in the system!\nDaryan:\nHey... You can say what you want about me, but back off of International Affairs! There ain't no \"loopholes\", OK? What do you think we are, boy scouts?\nApollo:\nThat wasn't what I was trying to... um...\nKlavier:\nDown, Daryan. ...It's as you say. There are no loopholes, at least in the case of these cocoons. International Affairs, Interpol, and Borginian Customs are all watching.\nDaryan:\nSee, we know what we're doing! Not like some yipping little doggies that lap up every word that diva says.\nApollo:\n...! Why I oughta...!\nDaryan:\nOughta what? You want some of this?\nKlavier:\nAh ha. Chill, both of you. Let's do this cool, ja?\nApollo:\n(Grr! Screw cool! I want this guy's head on a stick!)Daryan:\nHey, man, if there's a way to get cocoons out of there, I'd sure like to know.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nYou're in a position to know quite a bit about smuggling.\nDaryan:\nYeah, I need to know a bit for work, sure. But all we get are reports on the failed smuggling ops. Not exactly something you want to go copying. But if you want, I can tell you a few of them. Maybe you'll succeed and get rich!\nJudge:\n...I would be interested in hearing. Purely from a legal perspective, of course.\nApollo:\n(...I weep for our judicial system.)Present Prosecutor Gavin's Guitar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Actually, there is one way.\"Apollo:\n(...The replica has to be the key to his motive... There's got to be a way to find out what he was up to!)",

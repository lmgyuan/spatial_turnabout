  "previousContext": "Episode 3Turnabout Serenade\nLet's rock!!!\nKlavier:\nWe love you! Rock on, everyone! This party's not over yet! Get out your handkerchiefs for our special guest! That's right, baby! The night's just getting started!\nThank you for coming to the Gavinners: \"Guilty as Charged\" Tour! This ends the first part of tonight's show. There will now be a 20-minute intermission.\nJuly 7, 8:05 PMBackstage Hallway\nTrucy:\nThis is so cool! Us, at a Gavinners concert!\nApollo:\nHuh? Did you say something? My ears are still ringing... The Gavinners: putting the \"sick\" back in \"music\".\nTrucy:\nWell, I thought Mr. Gavin was really nice! Sending us those tickets at 20% off! They're hard to get ahold of, you know.\nApollo:\nWhen you invite people to a concert it's usually free.\nTrucy:\nLet's head to his dressing room, Apollo! You know, like we're a couple of VIPs. I've always dreamed of being a VIP at a Gavinners show!\nApollo:\nUm, Trucy... You didn't know who Prosecutor Gavin was before that case. What kind of fan doesn't know the lead vocalist's name?\nTrucy:\nOh! This guy, well, he was more like a prince really. He let us in...\nTrucy:\nKlavier... What a lovely name! He's so dreamy!\nTrucy:\nYeah, but I'm a girl! I'm supposed to swoon over gods of rock!\nApollo:\nGod-awful, maybe.\nTrucy:\nI bought all their stuff on the way home from the trial! I got twelve Gavinners albums, and fifteen concert videos!\nApollo:\n...That was quite a bit of impulse shopping.\nTrucy:\nI got an advance on my next 15-years-worth of allowance.\nApollo:\n...For Mr. Wright that sounds like a real act of generosity.\nApollo:\n(Who would have imagined me here... ...at a Gavinners concert, watching Prosecutor Gavin \"rock\". To be honest... ...he was kind of cool. And I'm kind of envious. Not that I'd ever admit that to Trucy.)\nJuly 7Gavinners's Dressing Room\nKlavier:\nAh, you made it.\nTrucy:\nMr. Gavin! Thanks so much for the tickets!\nApollo:\n...And the invoice you sent along with them.\nTrucy:\nYou were incredible up on stage, Mr. Gavin!\nKlavier:\nNothing like music to brighten the mood after a trial, ja? ...And we're almost ready for our next act. I'm looking forward to it myself.\nTrucy:\nLamiroir's singing, right!? The \"Siren of the Ballad\"?\nApollo:\nOh yeah... That flyer said she flew all the way over for this show.\nKlavier:\nThat's right. I happened to catch her show while overseas. Her voice... is divine. I knew I had to invite her to perform with us.\n???:\nLamiroir says... \"You praise me too highly.\"\nApollo:\n(Whoa! Who's this guy? He's huge!)\nKlavier:\nAh, allow me to introduce Mr. Romein LeTouse. ...Lamiroir's manager. And her interpreter, incidentally.\nLeTouse:\nIt is a great honor for us to be here. And a great honor for Lamiroir to be heard in this country.\n???:\n[Foreign text]....\nApollo:\n(That voice... I wish I could understand it... It's beautiful.)\n???:\n[Foreign text]... [Foreign text]...\nTrucy:\nOoooh! It's Lamiroir! I'm actually meeting Lamiroir!\nApollo:\n(Lamiroir... Mysterious songstress... Her quiet, deep song glides through the air... Lilting above a sparse, but elegant piano accompaniment. Now this is music. She's a real artist.)\nLamiroir:\n[Foreign text]....\nLeTouse:\nLamiroir says... \"We have long looked forward to this joint performance.\"\nKlavier:\nAh, Lamiroir... Your voice... ...It is art.\nLamiroir:\n[Foreign text]....\nLeTouse:\n\"Yet without his piano to guide me... ...it is but a voice.\"\n???:\n....................\nApollo:\n(I've seen this kid somewhere before.)\nTrucy:\nHe plays piano at all of Lamiroir's concerts! He's cute! And he's a really good pianist.\nApollo:\nGood pianists are a dying breed, I hear.\nLeTouse:\nAllow me to introduce Machi Tobaye. ...He is blind. This is why he never strays far from Lamiroir. They are always together.\nMachi:\n....................\nApollo:\n(They're like characters from some fairy tale..)\nTrucy:\nLamiroir's so, um, what's that word... Exotic! ...And mysterious!\nApollo:\nShe does seem quite pretty. At least, her eyes do.\nKlavier:\nHers is a kind of \"sight-seeing musique\"...\nTrucy:\nHuh?\nKlavier:\nShe travels the globe, putting the sights she sees into song. Even though her appearance and voice are exotic... ...her songs remind us of something close, and warm.\nTrucy:\nSights into song... That's so poetic!\nKlavier:\nShe was gracious enough to put music to my lyrics tonight. \"The Guitar's Serenade\". ...I hope you enjoy it.\nTrucy:\nI can't wait!\nKlavier:\n...And now it is time. For the next part, we're giving the Gavinners's hard rock a little rest. Lamiroir, the stage is yours.\nLamiroir:\n[Foreign text]....\nLeTouse:\nThe band members will not play during Lamiroir's ballad. Only Machi's tender tones, and Lamiroir's dulcet voice...\nKlavier:\n...And my guitar, of course.\nTrucy:\nWoo hoo! Nights like this make it all worthwhile, you know!\nApollo:\n(I should have learned to play the guitar. There's not much romance in Chords of Steel.)\nKlavier:\nShall we hit the stage, then?\nTrucy:\nGood luck, Mr. Gavin!\nKlavier:\nTake care your hearts aren't stolen away, ja?\nTrucy:\nLet's get back to the concert hall, Polly!\nSugar, Sugar...\nO that night, in your embrace.\nWhen you stole away the keys\nmy heart held on to so tight.\nPleasure...\nBut a fleeting melody\nIt wraps itself around me,\nAnd now through the air I fly.\nWoh... Woh...\nBurning on in my heart. Fire.\nBurn my love away. All away.\nLike a bullet of love. Fire.\nTake my life away. All away.\nGuitar, Guitar...\n\nUp together to the sky.\nJuly 7, 9:05 PMBackstage Hallway\nTrucy:\nWow, wasn't Lamiroir amazing? I *sniffle* I even cried a little!\nApollo:\nI was surprised Prosecutor Gavin actually burned his guitar.\nTrucy:\nYeah! That even surprised me, and I'm a magician! What a production!\nApollo:\nWhat a destruction. (I don't think Prosecutor Gavin was expecting it either, oddly. He looked as surprised as I was.)\nTrucy:\nIs that what they call \"risking life and limb for art\"? I think he's my new hero!\nApollo:\nI'm not sure I'd call that \"art\".\nTrucy:\nWell, what are we doing here? Let's get going to Mr. Gavin's dressing room! There's twenty minutes till the last part of the show!\nApollo:\nHow many breaks does this band need?\nJuly 7Gavinners's Dressing Room\nKlavier:\nWhat the heck was that!? I was never consulted about it!\nStaff:\nS-Sorry, Mr. Gavin, sir! I've asked the man in charge...\nKlavier:\nI play new rock, not Great Balls of Fire! Speaking of fire, I have a good mind to fire whoever's responsible!\nTrucy:\n...He seems upset.\nKlavier:\nApollo Justice! Were you the one who tried to torch me!?\nApollo:\nHey, I didn't do it!\nTrucy:\nSo much for risking your life for art...\nKlavier:\n\"The Guitar's Serenade\" is ruined! Ruined!\nTrucy:\nWell, let's try to talk to him at least.\nApollo:\n...I'm not sure that's the best move right now.\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nKlavier:\nAlmost time for the third act of the night.\nTrucy:\nOh! There's more?\nKlavier:\nYes! Lamiroir's part is done. Now it's time for us to drop our groove again, ja? Hope you're ready to catch it.\nTrucy:\nWoo hoo! Ready, Apollo?\nApollo:\nUh... I think I'll pass.\nTrucy:\nEh.\nApollo:\nI liked the bit with Lamiroir. But the rest could use a volume knob. Turned way down.\nTrucy:\nAh, Apollo, you're getting old!\nApollo:\nAck! (Does 22 quality as \"old\" to a 15-year-old...?)\nTrucy:\nWell, I'm going!\nKlavier:\nLet the old folks rest backstage, ja? ...Time to rock.\nApollo:\n(Hey, you're older than I am!)\nJuly 7Backstage Hallway\nEma:\nHey, it's you! That Wright kid.\nApollo:\nDetective Skye! (I'll let that \"Wright kid\" business pass.)\nEma:\nCall me Ema. There's no need for titles once you've shared a bottle of fingerprinting powder!\nApollo:\nThat's a new one. So, um, Ema, what are you doing here?\nEma:\n...Isn't it obvious? I'm snacking. You think I want to be here!? Me, in charge of security in this pit!?\nApollo:\nSecurity...? Did something happen?\nEma:\nThere's no knowing with that glimmerous fop. Apparently, he's all upset because something was stolen. He wanted security back here during the concert. Where does he get off acting like he's some big rock star?\nApollo:\n(...He is a big rock star.)\nEma:\nHey! You listening to me?\nApollo:\nSo... Where's this door here lead to?\nEma:\nThis one? That's Lamiroir's dressing room. Don't even think of going in there unless you want a piece of Snackoos in your face!\nApollo:\n(Is she ever in a good mood, I wonder?)\nApollo:\nSo this is Lamiroir's dressing room.\nEma:\nIf you even think about going in there, I'll--\n...BANG...!\nApollo:\n......\nEma:\n......\nApollo:\nWhat was that?\n...BANG...!\nApollo:\nWas that... a gunshot?\n...CRASH...!\nApollo:\n(Something's going on!)\nEma:\nYou, out of my way!\nApollo:\nE-Ema!\nEma:\nLamiroir! Lamiroir!\n......\nEma:\nIt's not locked... I'm going in!\nJuly 7, 9:30 PMLamiroir's Dressing Room\nApollo:\n(What's that awful noise... Oh, it's the concert.) Aaack! That's-- (It's Lamiroir's manager! Mister what's-his-name...)\nEma:\nLeTouse! Oh no... Hey, you!\nApollo:\nM-Me?\nEma:\nWatch this room for me. I have to call for backup!\nApollo:\nR-Right, understood. You want me to make sure no one comes in, right?\nEma:\nAnd don't touch anything! I'll be right back!\nApollo:\n(...What's going on? I just talked to him, and now...)\nLeTouse:\n......Nnnh......\nApollo:\n...! (He... He's alive!) Mr. LeTouse! Can you hear me!?\nLeTouse:\n...Sh...Shot. ...I was...shot.\nApollo:\nWho? Who shot you!?\nLeTouse:\n...I don't know... Ask...\nApollo:\nAsk? Ask what?\nLeTouse:\nAsk... wi...witness...\nApollo:\nWitness... There was a witness!? Who!?\nLeTouse:\n...Cold... so cold... Witness...\nApollo:\nYou're cold? D-Don't worry, you're going to be fine! Help is on the way!\nLeTouse:\n...Can't s...see...\nApollo:\nHang in there, Mr. LeTouse! Tell me, who was the witness?\nLeTouse:\nThe wi...witness...is ...si...si...ren...\nApollo:\n(...\"Siren\"? How can a siren witness anything...?) Mr. LeTouse! Yipes! Ema!? (What was that!?) Wh-Who's there!?\nEma:\nWhat's wrong?\nApollo:\nEma! Did you see anyone just now!?\nEma:\nHuh? No...\nApollo:\n(I could have sworn I heard a door close...)\nEma:\nThe concert's been cancelled. Backup's on its way. Is Mr. LeTouse... ...He's dead, isn't he? That's terrible.\nApollo:\n...! (I lost him!)\nApollo:\n(Romein LeTouse... shot. And I heard his last words... \"The witness is the siren\"... Whatever that means.)\nJuly 7Backstage Hallway\n???:\nThe venue's locked down. We took names and addresses before letting the crowd go.\nKlavier:\nGood work, Daryan.\n???:\nI'll let you know if I find out anything about the victim. Later.\nKlavier:\nIt's investigation time, then, ja, Fräulein Detective?\nEma:\nI don't need some rock 'n' rolling prosecutor to tell me that.\nKlavier:\nOne request I must make... Tell no one, on staff or otherwise, anything of this.\nTrucy:\nOoh, a gag order!\nKlavier:\nNo word gets out, other than that Mr. LeTouse is dead. No word of the cause of death, or of the murder.\nApollo:\nTell no one... Not even Lamiroir?\nKlavier:\nNot even her. We must keep everything under wraps. Oh, one other thing. I'll need your signature on this, Herr Forehead. Yours too, Fräulein.\nApollo:\nOn that? Hmm... An \"Investigation Request\"...?\nTrucy:\nWhy just us?\nKlavier:\nYou two are civilians. It's standard procedure.\nApollo:\n(That should be OK to sign, I think...)\nSigned Prosecutor Gavin's Investigation Request.\nKlavier:\nRight, well, get started with the investigation!\nEma:\nI'm on it already!\nKlavier:\nAh, and one tip for you.\nApollo:\nHuh? Me?\nKlavier:\nTry not to get in the Fräulein detective's way. ...She's in a foul mood today.\nApollo:\n(Gee, I wonder why...)\nApollo:\n(We were all questioned as witnesses... ...And now none of us can go home. We'll investigate alright. ...Our way!)\nTrucy:\n...Somehow I don't see us getting back to that crime scene any time soon.\nApollo:\nI still can't believe I was there when it happened. Not an experience I care to repeat any time soon.\nTrucy:\nThis is no time for navel-gazing! Let's crack this case!\nApollo:\n(I worry about Trucy. She seems to have a very loose idea of what it means to be an \"attorney\". Of course, that's not surprising considering who her father is...)\nTrucy:\nSomething the matter?\nApollo:\nNo... Let's get cracking!\nApollo:\n(I'm the only one who was there... The only one who heard Mr. LeTouse's last words.)\nLeTouse:\nThe wi...witness...is ...si...si...ren...\nApollo:\n(First order of business is to find out what he meant by \"siren\"!)\nJuly 7Gavinners's Dressing Room\nTrucy:\nHuh. Looks like nobody's here.\nApollo:\nProsecutor Gavin's probably busy with the case, too. No rest for the wicked.\nTrucy:\nNo rest for us, either, Apollo! Let's get rocking! Rock, rock!\nJuly 7In the Wings\nTrucy:\nHmm. The stage looks empty.\nApollo:\nI was hoping to get a chance to talk to Prosecutor Gavin...\nTrucy:\nOh well. Nothing to do but go to the crime scene, I guess!\nApollo:\nI guess...\nJuly 7Lamiroir's Dressing Room\nEma:\nOh, it's you. I figured you'd come.\nApollo:\nYou have to let us investigate the scene, please!\nEma:\nYou're attorneys, no? Shouldn't you wait until you have a client...?\nApollo:\n(LeTouse did tell me to ask the witness, the siren... ...With his dying breath, no less. Doesn't that count?)\nEma:\n...G-Glare at me all you want, you'll get no snacks from me.\nTrucy:\nPlease! Think of poor Lamiroir!\nEma:\nHmph. Oh well, I suppose. You did find the body with me.\nApollo:\nGreat! Let's get to it!\nTrucy:\nRight!\nEma:\nJust try not to touch anything!\nApollo:\n(She's letting us look! And she's not munching her snacks! This bodes well. There are clues here, I can feel it! Leave no hanger unhung, no spot unspotted!)\nAfter clearing all Talk options and examining brooch and Romein LeTouse's left hand:\nEma:\nWell, that's about it. I think we've looked at just about everything there is.\nApollo:\nI guess you're right.\nEma:\nI know how you're feeling. It is hard to know when to stop. But anything more involved has to wait until the squad gets here.\nTrucy:\nArgh... I suppose...\nEma:\nI'll go report the evidence. Sorry, but could you wait here till I get back?\nApollo:\nHuh? Oh, actually, we have to--\nEma:\nGreat! Thanks!\nApollo:\n...She left.\nTrucy:\nWhat do we do, Apollo? She told us to wait...\nApollo:\nGreat. Now how am I supposed to investigate?\nTrucy:\nOh well, I guess it can't be helped. Let's go.\nApollo:\nHuh? Go?\nTrucy:\nTime's a wasting, Apollo! We've got a lot of ground to cover!\nApollo:\nWell, that's true, but... ...On second thought, why not. I'm sure everything will be fine.\nTrucy:\nOf course it will! Let's go!\nJuly 7Backstage Hallway\nTrucy:\nEeeeeeeeeeeeek!\nApollo:\nWho's there!?\nTrucy:\nWe... didn't just imagine that, did we?\nApollo:\nHe was wearing a silk hat. ...Friend of yours?\nTrucy:\nHardly!\nApollo:\n(Whoever that was, he sure looked suspicious!)\nJuly 7In the Wings\nKlavier:\nWhat is it with today!? Problem after problem! Achtung!\n???:\nYou ain't kidding.\nTrucy:\nIt's the two leading members of the Gavinners, Apollo! Klavier on vocals, and Daryan on guitar! They're so cool!\nApollo:\nI have a hard time thinking of \"Klavier\" as anything but a prosecutor, honestly.\nTrucy:\nHuh? What are they arguing about?\nApollo:\nProbably the case, I'd bet.\nKlavier:\nMy hog won't start. My guitar case is busted... ...my guitar's been burnt to a crisp, and to top it all off, someone's dead! ...And then there was that performance just now. What was that all about!?\nDaryan:\nHey, man, don't blame me. You were the one who missed the cue.\nKlavier:\nMe? Miss a cue!? How could I conceivably get the most important part of that song wrong? How!? And what was all that tinny playing of yours?\nDaryan:\nWho you calling \"tinny\"!?\nTrucy:\n...Sounds like they're having a spat. One of those \"differences in musical direction\" bands are always splitting up over.\nApollo:\nThis is hardly the time...\nKlavier:\n...Hmm? What are you two doing here?\nApollo:\nAh, um, hiya. ......\nKlavier:\nWe were just discussing the investigation, if you don't mind.\nApollo:\nSorry. Wait... You were what?\nKlavier:\nListen... You need to confirm that with the Republic of Borginia, Detective Crescend.\nDaryan:\nRight. Anything else?\nApollo:\nWhat did he just call him? \"Detective\"...?\nDaryan:\nAh, greetings. Daryan Crescend... Criminal Affairs, Division 3.\nApollo:\nUh... H-Hello. (\"Criminal Affairs\"!?)\nTrucy:\n*sigh* Apollo... You really don't know anything about the Gavinners, do you?\nApollo:\n(Something tells me that's about to be remedied.)\nAfter clearing \"The missed cue\" and \"The song's prediction\" Talk options:\nDaryan:\nThe lyrics predicting the crime... Klavier?\nKlavier:\nSeems a bit more than just a coincidence to me.\nDaryan:\nI have to agree. The key ring, the guitar, and the murder...\nApollo:\nThe key ring might have been dropped by accident.\nKlavier:\nYet the victim was holding it. Hard to think that it was unconnected.\nApollo:\nThat's true. (Prosecutor Gavin's as calm and collected as ever...)\nTrucy:\nSo the criminal matched their actions to the lyrics?\nDaryan:\nThat sounds likely.\nApollo:\nWhy would anyone do that?\nDaryan:\n...While we think about that, I'm going to get cracking on the biggest crime here. I'm going to talk to the Borginian Embassy about this Mr. LeTouse.\nKlavier:\nAh, right. Thanks, Daryan.\nDaryan:\nI'll leave the pondering of mysteries to you. I'm outta here.\nKlavier:\nA foreign national, Mr. LeTouse was killed... It seems like that would have to be the \"point\" of all this. But they did more than that. They left us with not only a murder, but a mystery!\nTrucy:\nMr. Gavin sure is irritable today.\nApollo:\nMaybe this is the real Prosecutor Gavin we don't get to see in the courtroom.\nKlavier:\n...I've had enough, frankly. If you find any more mysteries, do me a favor and keep them to yourselves, ja?\nApollo:\nJa... (I guess this is all we're going to get from Prosecutor Gavin. That leaves Lamiroir to question.) Prosecutor Gavin... do you know where Lamiroir is now?\nKlavier:\nAh, I had her go to my dressing room. With that pianist, Machi Tobaye, of course. She seemed rather shocked by Mr. LeTouse's sudden passing.\nApollo:\n(The Gavinners's dressing room. Got it!)\nJuly 7Backstage Hallway\nTrucy:\nEeeeeeeeeeeeek!\nApollo:\nWho's there!? ...There he goes again. Who is that guy!?\nTrucy:\n......\nApollo:\nHuh? Trucy?\nTrucy:\nYou know, he did look sort of familiar...\nApollo:\n...So he is a friend of yours!\nTrucy:\nNo, that's not it. ...Sorry, I don't remember.\nApollo:\n(Curiouser and curiouser...)\nJuly 7Gavinners's Dressing Room\nTrucy:\nAh... Lamiroir!\nLamiroir:\nWhat... What has happened? I heard that Mr. LeTouse has died!\nApollo:\nL-Lamiroir! You speak? I mean, you speak English?\nLamiroir:\nAh... Yes. I was invited here from the Republic of Borginia... But I am not Borginian by birth.\nTrucy:\nBut wasn't Mr. LeTouse your interpreter...?\nLamiroir:\nAh that. Yes, well... It was Mr. LeTouse's idea. He thought it would add to the mystery, you see.\nApollo:\nThen, your pianist is also...?\nMachi:\n....................\nLamiroir:\nNo, Machi Tobaye is Borginian. He does not speak English. Now, please tell me! What has happened to Mr. LeTouse? Why did he...\nTrucy:\nActually, Mr. LeTouse was...\nApollo:\nTrucy!\nTrucy:\nHuh?\nApollo:\nRemember what Prosecutor Gavin said? \"Not a word\"!\nTrucy:\nB-But Mr. LeTouse is Lamiroir's manager! That's not fair to her! I mean, isn't she a related party?\nApollo:\n(Precisely who Prosecutor Gavin doesn't want to alert, I'd suspect.)\nLamiroir:\nAll we have been told is to wait here in this room. It is very unsettling.\nApollo:\nI'm sorry, we're trying to figure it out ourselves. Do... you think I could ask you some questions?\nLamiroir:\nOf course. I am always willing to help.\nApollo:\n(She's as calm as she looked on stage... I can't put my finger on why, but I like this Lamiroir.)\nMachi:\n[Foreign text]....\nLamiroir:\nWhat is it, Machi?\nMachi:\n[Foreign text]....\nLamiroir:\nWhat... but you'd be alone!\nMachi:\n[Foreign text]....\nApollo:\nUm, what seems to be the problem?\nLamiroir:\nMachi... he is not good around strangers. He wishes to go out for a breath of fresh air. Would that be alright?\nApollo:\nUh, sure, of course.\nMachi:\n....................\nLamiroir:\nVery well. What is it you wished to ask me about?\nAfter clearing \"Lamiroir\" and \"Mr. LeTouse\" Talk options:\nApollo:\nThe \"siren\"... That's what he meant!\nTrucy:\nHuh? Apollo?\nApollo:\nYou are \"the Siren\", right Lamiroir?\nLamiroir:\nThat is the meaning of my name in Borginian, yes. (Changed from [That is the meaning of my name in Borginese, yes.] in the original release) It was the name my producer gave me. But why do you ask?\nApollo:\n...It's very important. I had to know for sure if the \"Siren\" was you.\nLamiroir:\nWhat do you mean, important?\nApollo:\n...I'll tell you. You deserve to know.\nAfter examining postcards, clearing \"The \"Siren\"\" Talk option, and presenting Brooch in Gavinners's Dressing Room:\nJuly 8, 12:22 AMBackstage Hallway\nApollo:\nWhoa! Who's there now!?\nEma:\nAh, it's you. ...Where were you!?\nApollo:\nAck! Ema! ...Is something wrong? (She's looks grumpier than usual.)\nEma:\nYou bet something's wrong! The impossible's happened! Arrgh! It's all your fault, you know!\nApollo:\n(Oops. Maybe this is about us leaving the crime scene.)\nTrucy:\nWhat do you mean by \"impossible\"?\nEma:\nWell it's gone! Utterly gone!\nTrucy:\n...What's gone?\nEma:\nThe body, stupid! What else?\nTrucy:\nEh...\nEma:\nMr. LeTouse's body has disappeared!\nTrucy:\nWhaaaaaaaaaat!?\nJuly 8Lamiroir's Dressing Room\nApollo:\nAh... Prosecutor Gavin.\nKlavier:\nFrom your vacant stare, I gather you've heard the news.\nApollo:\nI heard Mr. LeTouse's body has gone missing...\nKlavier:\nLook for yourself. Quite the pickle. Quite. The. Pickle.\nEma:\nHow can you just stand there!? We have to start the investi...\nKlavier:\nThere's no need for alarm, Fräulein Detective.\nEma:\n...!\nKlavier:\nAll entrances and exits have been sealed. The body will not leave the building. So, I suggest we go find ourselves a cadaver. There will be plenty of time to ponder the \"whys\" later.\nTrucy:\nWell, you seem pretty sure of yourself, Mr. Gavin.\nKlavier:\nOh, we'll find him. I'm rather enjoying this.\nApollo:\n(How could Mr. LeTouse's body just \"disappear\"?)\nTrucy:\nWell, you heard the man. Let's get searching!\nDaryan:\n...Hey, I don't know if this's exactly the right time, but...\nKlavier:\nYes, Daryan?\nDaryan:\nSee, Geeter's gone missing. It was in the dressing room.\nTrucy:\nGeeter? Who's Geeter!?\nDaryan:\nThat's what I call my guitar! You like, man?\nKlavier:\nYour guitar... was stolen?\nEma:\nThis hasn't been a good day for guitars or geeters.\nKlavier:\nOK. Body first, then guitar. And if someone finds that guitar, please bring it to our dressing room.\nDaryan:\nGeeter's like a missing person, not lost 'n' found, man.\nJuly 8, 12:57 AMIn the Wings\nTrucy:\nHmm. Does something seem different to you, Apollo?\nApollo:\nSomething is definitely different here.\nTrucy:\nLet's check it out!\nTrucy:\nThat stage there must have been lowered before.\nApollo:\nThat's the tower that Lamiroir and Prosecutor Gavin were singing on.\nTrucy:\nSomeone must have raised it. Hmm. I don't see a way to control it from here. Apollo, what about that ladder there against the wall? We could use that to take a look up top...\nApollo:\n...... Maybe we should get Ema.\nTrucy:\nWhat are you talking about? We have to see this sort of thing for ourselves!\nApollo:\n(I'm... not so good with heights.)\nTrucy:\nStop whining and start climbing!\nApollo:\nUrk...\nApollo:\n(It didn't look that high from below, really. But when we got to the top, I felt every one of those fifteen feet down. (Changed from [But when we got to the top, I felt every one of those 20 feet down.] in the original release) Of course, I wasn't thinking about the height any more. Not after what we found up there.)\nTrucy:\nEeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!\nApollo:\n(We found two things we were looking for, and one thing we never expected to find.) ...The body, guitar in hand, and the pianist, Machi Tobaye.\nJuly 8, 10:09 AMWright Anything Agency\nApollo:\nWow, that concert last night sure went south in a hurry!\nTrucy:\nNo kidding. Why did they arrest Machi!? Why!?\nApollo:\nDon't look at me like it's my fault! (Machi Tobaye, the blind pianist... ...arrested on suspicion of murdering Romein LeTouse.)\nTrucy:\nI can't believe such a cute little boy could do something so horrible!\nApollo:\nI guess they had proof of some kind.\nTrucy:\nWhat proof could possibly prove that!?\nKlavier:\nMornin'.\nApollo:\nP-Prosecutor Gavin?\nKlavier:\nWhat a night, eh? I apologize for being so upset...\nTrucy:\nMr. Gavin, do you know what's going on? Why did they arrest Machi!? Why!?\nApollo:\nDon't look at him like it's his fault either.\nKlavier:\nIt was tough for me, too. We performed together that night, after all. Yet...\nTrucy:\nYet?\nKlavier:\nThe powers that be say that, given the circumstances, it could only have been him.\nApollo:\nWhat do you mean by the \"circumstances\"?\nKlavier:\nLamiroir was invited from Borginia as an ambassador of goodwill. It is vital that this case be wrapped up swiftly. That's all the powers that be want, really.\nApollo:\nWell those are circumstances, alright. But what makes Machi the only possible suspect?\nKlavier:\nHerr Forehead... You seem to have forgotten that you're talking to the prosecution... the enemy.\nApollo:\nAh. Right. (I think I like this side of Prosecutor Gavin better, actually.)\nKlavier:\nI'm not at liberty to discuss the particulars of the case. ...Especially not to the defense attorney.\nApollo:\nWhat... did you just say? Me? The defense attorney?\nKlavier:\nThat's what I came to tell you. He's down at the detention center... He wants to request your services.\nApollo:\nHe...? You mean Machi? Machi wants me...?\nTrucy:\nThis is what we've been waiting for, Apollo! Let's get going!\nApollo:\nUh... Right...!\nKlavier:\nGood luck. I'm off to question Lamiroir.\nApollo:\nR-Right. Later! (I hope I'm up to this...)\nJuly 8Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nTrucy:\nWell, I just don't get it. I refuse to believe a cute little kid like that could do something so terrible.\nApollo:\n...You said that already.\nMachi:\n...........................\nTrucy:\nMachi! Everything's going to be OK! We're here for you!\nApollo:\nUm, h-hi. Maybe you can tell me about last night...\nMachi:\n[Foreign text]....\nTrucy:\nHuh?\nMachi:\n[Foreign text].... [Foreign text]!\nApollo:\n(That was when I realized how tough it must be... A little kid like this... ...in a country so far from everything he's ever known.)\nTrucy:\nUm, maybe Lamiroir can help?\nApollo:\nBut didn't Prosecutor Gavin say she was with him?\nKlavier:\nGood luck. I'm off to question Lamiroir.\nTrucy:\nWell, what are we going to do?\nApollo:\nThat's, um, a good question. (I can't think of anything we can do but go with this. ...And hope for the best at the trial tomorrow.)\nMachi:\n[Foreign text].... [Foreign text]....\nTo be continued.July 9, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3\nJudge:\nCourt is now in session for... how do I say that?\nKlavier:\n\"Machi Tobaye\", Your Honor. The Pixie of the Arpeggio.\nJudge:\nRight, his trial. Court is in session!\nApollo:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.\nKlavier:\nThe prosecution is A-OK, Herr Judge.\nJudge:\nHmm... Very well, Prosecutor Gavin.\nKlavier:\nAh, my opening statement, ja?\nJudge:\nNo, no, actually... There was something else I wanted to ask you about.\nKlavier:\n...? Yes?\nJudge:\nSay you're going to visit someone in the hospital with an incurable disease... What do you say to them?\nKlavier:\nEh?\nJudge:\nI mean, you wouldn't say \"get well soon\", right? You'd only be kicking them when they're down...\nApollo:\nUm, what are you talking about?\nJudge:\nAhem, actually I'm going to visit someone who is terminally ill. ...Right after this trial. The Chief Justice's son.\nApollo:\nThe Chief Justice...?\nJudge:\nHis son is afflicted with a most terrible disease... He doesn't have long, it seems.\nApollo:\nAh...\nJudge:\nSo I thought I'd go pay him a visit. I thought saying something moving might be the order of the day.\nTrucy:\nWhy don't grown-ups ever just say what's on their mind instead of pretending?\nApollo:\n(She's looking at me with something like... disgust.) ...Hey! What are you looking at me like that for!?\nJudge:\nIn any case... I'm a bit busy today, so let's wrap this up quickly. Prosecutor Gavin, your opening statement, briefly!\nKlavier:\nYou're in luck, Herr Judge... I believe you'll be going on your hospital visit sooner than you think.\nApollo:\n...!\nKlavier:\nFirst, to review the victim in this case. Romein LeTouse, age 35. The global manager for diva songstress, Lamiroir. The cause of death: blood loss due to being shot by a large caliber revolver. This report has all the details.\nJudge:\nThe court accepts this into evidence.\nLeTouse's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.\nJudge:\n45-caliber... That's quite large, isn't it? A direct hit from that could knock a man off his feet.\nKlavier:\nHowever, the bullet struck him in his shoulder. The damage to his body was slight... death was not immediate. Sadly, his blood loss was such that he could not be saved.\nJudge:\nHmm... I suppose the victim's condition could have been much worse, considering.\nCrime Photo added to the Court Record.\nKlavier:\n...Two shots were fired. One shot missed, the other penetrated and passed through the victim's shoulder. Both bullets were found in the wall at the scene. Observe the diagram... ...This is where the bullets hit.\nJudge:\nI see... The court accepts this evidence.\nDiagram added to the Court Record.\nJudge:\nIf we're talking about a 45-caliber revolver... ...we must assume that the killer was adept at the weapon's use.\nTrucy:\nReally?\nApollo:\nYeah, apparently, weapons that size have a powerful kickback. If, say, the judge tried to fire one, it'd break every bone in his body.\nJudge:\nThe defense will take more care in choosing examples!\nKlavier:\n...As I was saying, the victim was shot backstage, in a dressing room. This dressing room has only one entrance: this door.\nJudge:\nThat does seem to be the case, yes.\nKlavier:\nHowever, there were witnesses who heard the gunshots.\nTrucy:\nHe's talking about you and Ema, huh.\nKlavier:\nYet when the witnesses entered the room... ...it was empty, save for the victim's body, of course.\nJudge:\nB-But that's... That's impossible!\nKlavier:\nExactly. This murder was impossible. ...For all but one person.\nJudge:\nOne person?\nKlavier:\nThat is, of course... ...the defendant, Machi Tobaye.\nJudge:\nOnly this defendant could have committed the crime? But how?\nKlavier:\nIt's quite simple. The circumstances of the crime scene make it clear.\nJudge:\nVery well, I assume you have testimony to back up this claim. Please show the witness to the stand! (Changed from [Let the witness please take the stand!] in the original release)\nKlavier:\nYour name and profession, please.\nEma:\nEma Skye, I'm a detective for the police department. I was on security detail at the concert forum that night.\nApollo:\n(Ema seems... tired, somehow.)\nJudge:\nHmm... Security at the concert, you say?\nEma:\nSome security I was. Couldn't even stop a murder... ......\nJudge:\nNow, don't blame yourself! Things like this happen! I've made even bigger mistakes in my career, you know!\nApollo:\n(I'm sure that makes her feel much better.)\nTrucy:\nI want to hear about these bigger mistakes!\nKlavier:\nIn any case... Because you were on security detail, the crime was quickly discovered. And, we were able to identify the killer.\nEma:\n......\nKlavier:\nYou may give the court your testimony, if you would. Describe the circumstances of that day, and your discovery of the crime, please.\nEma:\n...Alright.\nWitness Testimony\n-- Murderous Circumstances --\nEma:\nThe night of the murder, I was on security backstage, at Prosecutor Gavin's request.\nOnly people involved with the concert in some way were allowed backstage.\nAt the beginning of the third set... I heard shots.\nI went into the room, filled with blaring rock music, and found the body.\nI examined the scene and determined that only the defendant could have done it.\nJudge:\nHmm... It was lucky that a detective was the first on the scene.\nTrucy:\nBut that door was the only way out of the room, right?\nApollo:\nYeah, pretty much.\nTrucy:\nThen I don't get it. How can they say that Machi did it?\nApollo:\nLooks like we need a bit more information.\nJudge:\nVery well, the defense may begin the cross-examination.\nCross Examination\n-- Murderous Circumstances --\nEma:\nThe night of the murder, I was on security backstage, at Prosecutor Gavin's request.\nEma:\nOnly people involved with the concert in some way were allowed backstage.\nEma:\nAt the beginning of the third set... I heard shots.\nEma:\nI went into the room, filled with blaring rock music, and found the body.\nEma:\nI examined the scene and determined that only the defendant could have done it.\nApollo:\n(I know the circumstances under which the body was found... I was there.)\nTrucy:\nAn examination of the crime scene was enough to nail down the killer?\nApollo:\nI'm sure they have a good reason. (They must have had a good reason to arrest Machi... ...And I'm going to find out what it was!)\nAfter pressing first, fourth, and fifth statements:\nJudge:\nI believe that's enough of that.\nApollo:\n!\nJudge:\nThe prosecution has a rather convincing case. The only way in and out of the crime scene was watched. Making the defendant the only one who could possibly leave the scene. Simple, and decisive.\nApollo:\nUgh...\nJudge:\nI believe we've heard enough to determine our verdict. Even if I wasn't in a hurry to make a hospital visit.\nKlavier:\nI'm sure the Chief Justice will appreciate the gesture. Unfortunately, we have no direct witnesses. Fortunately, the criminal left decisive evidence for us. That will have to be enough.\nApollo:\n(Argh! It can't be over already!)\nJudge:\nVery well, I believe this trial is finished. If the defense has no contradicting evidence...?\nKlavier:\nThe prosecution has presented our proof, clear and plain. If you have contradicting evidence... ...it'd better be clear and plain.\nTrucy:\nAck, Apollo! They've got us on the ropes already! We'd better come up with something quick!\nApollo:\nI know! I know! (Think! What can get us out of this!? We need evidence, or a witness, that can prove Machi is innocent beyond a doubt. Without that... *gulp*)\nJudge:\nMr. Justice? Do you have contradicting proof that can overturn the prosecution's case? If you do, you'd better tell us about it now.\nApollo:\n(This is it... and so soon! If I mess this one up, it's all over...!) The court wants contradicting proof?\nApollo:\nProsecutor Gavin, you claim that there were no witnesses to this crime. Are you absolutely sure?\nKlavier:\nAbsolutely. I'd swear it on my career as a prosecutor... And on my million-seller hit song \"Atroquinine, My Love\".\nTrucy:\n...There he goes again.\nApollo:\nThat's too bad, because there was a witness.\nJudge:\nHo ho! Really now? But how did you come to possess knowledge the prosecution clearly does not?\nApollo:\nBecause I am the only one in the world who knows this.\nApollo:\n(...What's going on? I just talked to him, and now...)\nLeTouse:\n......Nnnh......\nApollo:\n...! (He... He's alive!) Mr. LeTouse! Can you hear me!?\nLeTouse:\n...Cold... so cold... Witness...\nApollo:\nYou're cold? D-Don't worry, you're going to be fine! Help is on the way!\nLeTouse:\n...Can't s...see...\nApollo:\nHang in there, Mr. LeTouse! Tell me, who was the witness?\nLeTouse:\nThe wi...witness...is ...si...si...ren...\nJudge:\nWhaaat!? The victim said this before he died!?\nKlavier:\nPerhaps he did... and perhaps he did not.\nApollo:\nWhat do you mean by that?\nKlavier:\nAll we know is what Herr Forehead says he said. It's no testimony, especially since it comes from the defense attorney himself.\nApollo:\nApollo:\nBut it's the truth! He said it! I even told you about it! But apparently, you ignored me completely.\nKlavier:\nIt's my policy to fully investigate everything I deem relevant. Clearly this rookie lawyer thinks he can tell me how to do my job.\nJudge:\n...That's enough! Mr. Justice, we need clear contradictory proof from you. This witness of yours, unknown to the prosecution... ...I hope you're right. Failure carries a stiff penalty.\nKlavier:\nPerhaps... A stiffer penalty than usual is called for?\nApollo:\n(Urk! There's no backing out now!)\nJudge:\nLet's hear the name of your witness, Mr. Justice.\nJudge:\nLamiroir...?\nApollo:\nRecall Mr. LeTouse's last words.\nLeTouse:\nThe wi...witness...is ...si...si...ren...\nJudge:\nThe siren... Ah ha! He meant the \"Siren\"!\nApollo:\nThat's right. The \"Siren of the Ballad\"... Lamiroir! Lamiroir was only on stage for the second set... ...and she had access to the backstage area. She could have been a witness!\nJudge:\nI see... Well, Prosecutor Gavin?\nKlavier:\nMy claim still stands. There was no witness to this crime!\nJudge:\nVery well! Let's hear it from the horse's mouth then, shall we? We will now take a break from Detective Ema Skye's cross-examination. ...Please show Lamiroir to the witness stand.\nApollo:\n(Lamiroir would say nothing the night of the murder... Not today, though. Today we'll drag that story out of her no matter what it is!)\nKlavier:\n......\nKlavier:\nIt is my distinct honor to welcome the Siren of the Ballad to our courtroom...\nLamiroir:\nYou are too kind.\nJudge:\nAh, y-you can speak English?\nLamiroir:\nYes... Yes I can. Though I am not very good. ...There is much I do not know.\nJudge:\nYou speak so well! Have you spent time here before?\nLamiroir:\nActually, I do not know how I came by my knowledge of your language. Nor where I studied it...\nApollo:\n...? (What does she mean, she doesn't know...?)\nKlavier:\nI, too, thought to call her as a witness. But I did not. I had a reason, of course.\nApollo:\nWhat's that?\nKlavier:\nLamiroir... suffers from amnesia.\nJudge:\nAmnesia...?\nLamiroir:\nLamiroir... is not my true name. Yet I remember nothing of the time before I was given it. ...Nothing of the time before I started singing on stage.\nTrucy:\nWhoa! She's even more mysterious than I thought!\nKlavier:\nAs lauded singer Lamiroir, she lives a good life. There are little difficulties for her, thanks to her success. Yet... I did not wish to subject her to unnecessary stress.\nJudge:\nHmm... I see. I care surprisingly little about people's pasts. You have nothing to fear in this court, Lamiroir.\nLamiroir:\n...Thank you. Yet there is something I do not understand. I am being called as a witness? What might I say? No one will tell me anything of what happened...\nKlavier:\nLamiroir, let me be frank. I did not want to ask you up here to testify. Yet, that young gentleman with the wide forehead over there was adamant that you stand.\nLamiroir:\nOh my...\nTrucy:\nCongratulations, Apollo. You're the bad guy!\nApollo:\nUgh...\nJudge:\nWell, now that you're here, please give us your testimony. ...If nothing else, the sound of your voice is welcome. Tell us what you saw the night of the crime!\nWitness Testimony\n-- What I Saw --\nLamiroir:\nAs for what I saw... I saw nothing.\nThat night, I was invited to sing on stage, and this I did.\nI did not return backstage after the second set.\nThen I was led by the police to Mr. Gavin's dressing room, and told to wait there.\nThat was where I learned that something had happened... But I wasn't told the details.\nJudge:\nHmm... I must say, you sound wonderful just testifying.\nApollo:\n(I hope he was too distracted to hear what she was actually saying...)\nKlavier:\nThere you have it. She saw nothing that night. Now we can only pray that the defense has the sense to admit defeat. ...And refrain from detaining her here longer than need be.\nTrucy:\nWow, you just got badder, Apollo! Way to go!\nApollo:\nGrr...\nJudge:\nVery well, Mr. Justice. Keep it short and sweet!\nApollo:\n(Lamiroir wouldn't talk to me the night of the crime. She must know something, and I've got to find out what!)\nCross Examination\n-- What I Saw --\nLamiroir:\nAs for what I saw... I saw nothing.\nLamiroir:\nThat night, I was invited to sing on stage, and this I did.\nLamiroir:\nI did not return backstage after the second set.\nLamiroir:\nWhen my performance was finished, I went backstage for just a moment...\nLamiroir:\nI saw nothing. The late Mr. LeTouse's body was behind a wall.\nLamiroir:\nI saw bullet holes in the wall, and knew Mr. LeTouse had been shot...\nLamiroir:\nThen I was led by the police to Mr. Gavin's dressing room, and told to wait there.\nLamiroir:\nThat was where I learned that something had happened... But I wasn't told the details.\nApollo:\n(Think, what doesn't ring true about her testimony?)\nTrucy:\n...It's hard to imagine Lamiroir lying...\nApollo:\nShe might not be lying, but she's hiding something... (What wouldn't she tell me the night of the murder?)\nApollo:\nLamiroir. They call you the Siren of the Ballad... ...but lies are hardly becoming of such a creature.\nJudge:\n...A put-down worthy of our prosecutor, Mr. Justice.\nTrucy:\n...Such put-downs are hardly becoming of you, Apollo.\nKlavier:\n...Stop polishing your forehead and start polishing your character, ja?\nApollo:\n(C'mon, can't I be cool for once!?) Observe the diagram! Lamiroir, you looked in from the door for just a moment. Correct?\nLamiroir:\nY-Yes, that is so.\nApollo:\nThere were bullet holes in the room, yes. But they were in the wall the door is on!\nLamiroir:\nEh...\nApollo:\nYou see? Assuming you merely glanced into the room... ...you couldn't have seen those bullet holes!\nLamiroir:\nYeeeeeeeeeeeeeooowrk!\nJudge:\n...... Lamiroir.\nLamiroir:\n...Yes.\nJudge:\nI'm afraid the defense has raised a good point. It appears you have been holding back something.\nLamiroir:\n...And I must tell you? I must tell you what it is that I saw?\nJudge:\nYes. The happenings in this trial are being recorded. And I'm certain it will be on the news in Borginia. You understand your reputation is at stake. It falls to you to avoid tarnishing it.\nKlavier:\nPersonally speaking... I still believe that cross-examining her will yield us absolutely nothing.\nApollo:\nBut she knew how Mr. LeTouse died! And he named her as a witness! You must have seen something, Lamiroir!\nJudge:\n...Very well. Lamiroir... Please continue your testimony.\nLamiroir:\n... Very well, I shall.\nWitness Testimony\n-- What I Saw 2 --\nLamiroir:\nI was on my way from the stage to the backstage exit.\nThere was something like a little window there... That's how I saw it.\nThere were two shots... I couldn't do anything to stop it.\nBut it wasn't Machi!\nIt was a grown person! ...I know it was!\nJudge:\nSo you did witness the crime! And the killer was... a grown person, you say?\nKlavier:\nAch. This is my first time hearing this, I assure you. Nice play, Herr Forehead.\nApollo:\n......\nJudge:\nVery well, Herr... er, Mr. Justice. You may begin your cross-examination!\nTrucy:\nGreat going, Apollo! You were right about Lamiroir. ...What's wrong? You don't look too happy.\nApollo:\n(This whole thing smells fishy... That's what's wrong.)\nTrucy:\n...?\nCross Examination\n-- What I Saw 2 --\nLamiroir:\nI was on my way from the stage to the backstage exit.\nLamiroir:\nThere was something like a little window there... That's how I saw it.\nLamiroir:\nThere were two shots... I couldn't do anything to stop it.\nLamiroir:\nBut it wasn't Machi!\nLamiroir:\nIt was a grown person! ...I know it was!\nTrucy:\nYou can't ask for a better testimony than that!\nApollo:\nI'm not so sure it's all that simple, Trucy. (There's a critical flaw in this testimony... And I have to point it out, even if it isn't good for our case...)\nApollo:\nA \"grown person\"... That's a little vague.\nLamiroir:\nI am sorry. My skill with your language is... lacking, I know.\nJudge:\nCertainly you could at least see whether the shooter was male or female?\nLamiroir:\n...... It was a man. A young man.\nJudge:\nAnd you're sure of that?\nLamiroir:\nYes, his voice was quite clear.\nApollo:\nVoice...?\nJudge:\nHmm... Looking at this diagram, it seems the dressing room was quite cluttered. It does seem likely that you wouldn't have had a clear view of the shooter.\nLamiroir:\nAs a singer, I rely more on my ears than my eyes. When I hear a voice, I do not forget it. That voice... was the voice of a man.\nKlavier:\nSo you heard a voice. But wait... ...Couldn't that have been the victim, Mr. LeTouse?\nLamiroir:\nAbsolutely not. Did I not just say that I do not forget a voice? If it was Mr. LeTouse who spoke, I would have known.\nJudge:\nHmm... Indeed. So you were at the window, and you heard the shooter's voice, the voice of a young man.\nTrucy:\nApollo! This is a good testimony! That proves it wasn't Machi!\nApollo:\n......\nJudge:\nIndeed... If this turns out to be true, it would cast this case in a considerably different light. What is the defense's opinion of this testimony...?\nKlavier:\nLamiroir. I understand why you would want to protect Machi. Yet remember, you are the Siren of the Ballad... ...And lies do not become such a creature.\nJudge:\nWhat does the prosecution mean!?\nTrucy:\nApollo! What's he talking about!?\nApollo:\n(How come no one bats an eye when he says stuff like that?)\nKlavier:\nI recall the state of the crime scene quite well.\nApollo:\nThe state of the room...?\nKlavier:\nYes, and when the murder took place... ...that window was closed. I find it hard to believe you could hear a voice through it.\nLamiroir:\nWhat!? B-But I... I'm sure...\nKlavier:\n...Lamiroir. I have nothing but the highest regard for your musical sense. ...But my opinion of you as a witness is somewhat lesser.\nApollo:\nApollo:\nB-But she's the only eye-witness we have!\nKlavier:\nKlavier:\nSo you say. And the victim named her, the \"Siren\" as the witness?\nApollo:\nTh-That's right! That's what Mr. LeTouse...\nKlavier:\nWe heard your claim. We even entertained the possibility. And it brought us to this. Herr Judge!\nJudge:\nYes?\nKlavier:\nThe prosecution requests that the witness... be excused. Please.\nJudge:\nHmm... I'm afraid I must honor the prosecution's request. There is indeed a question of the witness's credibility.\nApollo:\nB-But if Lamiroir can't testify...\nTrucy:\nThen we don't have a chance of proving Machi's innocence.\nJudge:\nThis cross-examination is over! ...Prosecutor Gavin. You may continue making your case.\nKlavier:\n...Danke. Now where were we? Ah yes, I would like to hear from Fräulein Detective again.\nApollo:\nApollo:\nWait! Let me hear Lamiroir's testimony one last time...\nJudge:\nBut the cross-examination is already over. Until such a time as a need arises... ...this witness may leave the stand.\nLamiroir:\n...... I'm sorry I could not be of more assistance.\nKlavier:\n......\nKlavier:\nAt last, back to the real trial. Ready, Herr Forehead?\nApollo:\n(Grr... I hope I didn't just miss my only chance.)\nKlavier:\nFräulein Detective, how far had we gotten until we were so rudely interrupted?\nEma:\nDon't ask me!\nKlavier:\nI dislike saying the same thing twice. And I never repeat a song for an encore.\nJudge:\n...If you would, Ms. Skye.\nEma:\n...Hmph. I believe I was saying that the only way Mr. LeTouse's killer could have escaped... ...was through that air vent on the ceiling.\nJudge:\nAh, yes, there was only one door in the room. And a witness, you, was standing in front of it.\nEma:\nThat air vent isn't very big, see. Kind of limits the people who could possibly get through.\nJudge:\nI certainly would have a difficult time.\nEma:\nYou sure would. Not that you would have been there in the first place, though. Remember, the whole backstage area was off-limits to people not involved with the concert. The only one who meets the conditions for our killer... is the defendant.\nKlavier:\n...A virtuoso performance! I couldn't have put it better myself.\nJudge:\nHmm. She does state a clear case. Though, reading the report, something caught my eye.\nKlavier:\nOh? What's that?\nJudge:\nThe circumstances of the defendant's arrest.\nApollo:\nThe circumstances...? (Again...?)\nTrucy:\nHey, that's right, Apollo! Remember when we found Machi? That was bizarre!\nApollo:\n(She's right... Why did Mr. LeTouse's body disappear from the room... ...and end up on top of that stage tower? ...Holding a guitar, no less.)\nKlavier:\n...A perceptive observation, Herr Judge.\nJudge:\nAh, er, thanks! It was kind of an accident, really. But you work in this job long enough... ...you get a nose for things. Eh he he.\nTrucy:\nThe judge sure seems pleased with himself!\nKlavier:\nVery good, Fräulein Detective. Perhaps you can tie it all together for us. Why was the body moved? And how does that lead us to the killer!?\nWitness Testimony\n-- The Missing Body --\nEma:\nI believe Machi stole the body because of some lyrics.\nHe moved the body to match Lamiroir's song.\nNo one in this country had a motive to kill the victim.\nAnd, Machi practically left his signature at the scene.\nAll of the evidence clearly points to the defendant.\nApollo:\nLamiroir's... song?\nKlavier:\nYes... \"The Guitar's Serenade\". You noticed its \"code\" too, did you not?\nApollo:\nIts \"code\"...?\nKlavier:\nAll the events that day followed the lyrics to our song. First, the keys my \"heart\" held on to so tightly were stolen.\nApollo:\nThen Prosecutor Gavin's guitar burst into flames on stage. Mr. LeTouse's life was taken by a bullet...\nKlavier:\nThe rest hardly needs explanation... \"Guitar, Guitar... Up together to the sky.\"\nJudge:\nTh-That's mad! It's like a story out of some fairy tale!\nApollo:\n(I admit, I'd forgotten about the song... But there it is now, waiting for me... the grand finale, as it were.)\nTrucy:\nHey! You know I was the one who first noticed that!\nJudge:\nI've heard of jumping rope to songs, and counting to songs... ...But killing!?\nKlavier:\nIt's a wild world out there, Herr Judge.\nJudge:\nVery well! We've heard one song and dance, let's get on to the next: the cross-examination!\nApollo:\n(I'm not so sure I'm going to be doing much singing...)\nCross Examination\n-- The Missing Body --\nEma:\nI believe Machi stole the body because of some lyrics.\nEma:\nHe moved the body to match Lamiroir's song.\nEma:\nNo one in this country had a motive to kill the victim.\nEma:\nAnd, Machi practically left his signature at the scene.\nEma:\nAll of the evidence clearly points to the defendant.\nEma:\nFrom the state of the crime scene, I conclude the shooter was blind.\nTrucy:\nThis doesn't look so good, does it, Apollo?\nApollo:\nNo, it doesn't.\nTrucy:\n...... What do we do!?\nApollo:\n(First, we don't panic. Even though Machi's case is leaking water by the gallon. Gavin's on a roll, and it's up to me to stop him!)\nApollo:\nThis is that evidence!\nJudge:\nThe photograph of the crime scene...?\nApollo:\n(I don't care much for the smirk on Prosecutor Gavin's face... But this is no time to think twice... Time to press on!) Yes, Your Honor, the crime scene. There is something in here that decisively contradicts the prosecution's point!\nKlavier:\nThen perhaps you'd best show us this \"something\". Get your finger out of the breeze and put it to good use, ja?\nJudge:\nVery well, show us what you're talking about, Mr. Justice! The contradiction at the scene of the crime is...\nApollo:\nThe contradiction is right here!\nEma:\nThe smeared blood stains...!\nJudge:\nHmm... I thought it was just my blurry vision. But it really was blurry! The way the victim's hand is raised above his head... ...Much like a gesture I have seen many times in this court.\nEma:\nIt's almost as if he wrote something...?\nTrucy:\nAh ha! I get it! At least, I think I get it!\nKlavier:\nGet what, Fräulein?\nTrucy:\nWhen Mr. LeTouse was shot, he tried to write something! And what would he write but the shooter's name? And what would he write it in but his own blood? Pretty good, huh?\nApollo:\n(Thanks for making my point for me...) Yes, in fact, that's what I think happened here.\nJudge:\nHmm... That does seem to be a distinct possibility.\nEma:\nThe victim wrote the killer's name... ...It's certainly a logical conclusion.\nTrucy:\nDrat! I just wish it wasn't all rubbed out like that.\nJudge:\nOf course it's rubbed out. Why, if I were a killer... ...I certainly wouldn't want to leave my own name behind!\nKlavier:\nNeither would I.\nEma:\n......\nKlavier:\n......\nJudge:\n......\nApollo:\nUm... No one has anything else to say?\nJudge:\n...About what?\nApollo:\nSo the prosecution accepts this? You agree this was the victim making an attempt to record the name of the killer? ...And that the killer tried to rub the name out?\nEma:\nWhat's your point?\nApollo:\nWhat's my point!? Let me ask you this: How did the killer know the victim was writing their name?\nEma:\nWell, Mr. LeTouse was writing something in blood. Once the killer saw what it was... ...Wait.\nJudge:\nOnce he \"saw\" what it was...?\nApollo:\nBut what did you just testify about the shooter?\nEma:\nI said... they were blind. Ack!!!\nApollo:\nYet the crime scene itself contradicts that! The killer had to have been able to see! Why would they rub out the name in blood otherwise?\nEma:\nAh... ahh...\nApollo:\nMay I remind the court that the defendant, Machi Tobaye, is blind! He couldn't have been the shooter!\nEma:\nUrk... Immmmmmmmposssssibbleee!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Order!!! P-Prosecutor Gavin! Please explain to me what all this means!?\nKlavier:\n......\nJudge:\nI mean, looking at this photo... It seems quite clear that the shooter could see! Yet, up until now...\nKlavier:\n...It seems I owe the court an apology.\nJudge:\nHmm!?\nKlavier:\nThe Gavinners are a band with law enforcement ties, yet a murder occurred... ...during our concert! Apparently, this caused some confusion over jurisdiction. As a result, some reports were not filed in an entirely timely manner.\nApollo:\n(I... I'm not sure I like the vibe I'm getting here.)\nTrucy:\nHey Apollo, look at him. Why is Prosecutor Gavin all relaxed and smiling like that? Like he knows something we don't... and he's about to tell us.\nKlavier:\nHeh heh heh. I've got an idea... Let's rock! ...With these documents. But before that. I have a question for the Fräulein Detective. If I may?\nEma:\nWh-What?\nKlavier:\nTell me... Why do you think that Machi Tobaye is blind?\nEma:\nHuh...?\nApollo:\nWh-What did he say?\nEma:\nWhat are you saying? Of course he's blind!\nKlavier:\nOf course...?\nEma:\nH-He's the blind pianist, right? So... So he's... Doesn't Lamiroir lead him around by the hand all the time?\nApollo:\n(No way...)\nKlavier:\nI have a report here on the defendant, Machi Tobaye. According to this, Machi Tobaye... ...can see perfectly well.\nEma:\nWhat...?\nKlavier:\nHis blindness was merely a publicity ploy by those clever Borginians. He can see quite well.\nApollo:\nApollo:\nB-But you said...\nKlavier:\n...What did I say, exactly?\nApollo:\n!\nKlavier:\nHerr Forehead, not once in the course of this trial... ...have I claimed the defendant was blind. The only one who did was Fräulein Detective.\nApollo:\nBu-But that's...\nKlavier:\n...A significant fact, yes! Consider: Machi Tobaye sees. And he was the only one who could have fled through the air vent. I see no problems with this.\nEma:\nBut what about the bullet holes in the wall?\nKlavier:\nYes, the bullet holes. I believe Herr Forehead neatly explained those for us. He didn't miss because he couldn't see. It was the kickback from the 45-caliber revolver. A simple accident, in other words.\nApollo:\nAck...!\nKlavier:\nHow's that? I'm afraid your \"objection\" has just flown off for brighter skies...\nApollo:\nUrk...\nKlavier:\nThis is where the real fun begins, Herr Forehead!\nApollo:\nYeeeeaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrggh!\nKlavier:\nI knew you didn't have what it took.\nEma:\nYou... You jerk! Just what was I in here for? Comic relief!?\nTrucy:\nYeah! Apologize!\nKlavier:\nAh ha ha. Oh, sorry!\nTrucy:\nThat's no way to apologize!\nApollo:\n(He's angered the Trucy now. Look out...)\nJudge:\nAhem. If we can please end the bickering. Now.\nEma:\nWhatever! I'm not leaving! I can't leave like this. I'll come up with some clue to solving this case if it kills me!\nJudge:\nBut your testimony has already given us enough to convict the defendant...\nApollo:\n(Ugh, don't say that...)\nEma:\nAh! Ah ha!\nApollo:\n\"Ah ha\" what?\nEma:\nThis blood stain... The criminal tried to wipe it off, right?\nApollo:\nThat seems to be what happened, yes.\nEma:\nWe might be able to find out what was really written here!\nApollo:\n...! Really...? You can do that?\nEma:\nThat's right, with this! It's called Luminol! Maybe you know of it? It's a chemical that reacts to blood.\nKlavier:\nAh yes, have we done those tests yet...?\nEma:\nHah! As if I'm going to tell you!\nKlavier:\nThe blood stains covered a section of the carpet. In order to perform blood tests, that section was removed and submitted. Perhaps we should request it here in court now.\nEma:\nRight! Go for it, Apollo!\nApollo:\nHuh? I have to do the test?\nEma:\nYou just have to spray the luminol on it! Simple!\nApollo:\n(A chemical that reacts to blood... I've heard of this somewhere.)\nJudge:\n...Yes, I believe an analysis is called for. Have at it!\nEma:\nRight, ready? It's easy as pie! Just press [A / Space] to spray an area. (Changed from [Just touch the screen to spray an area.] in the original release) Here! Give it a try!\nApollo:\n(...The eyes of the entire court are focused on me!)\nTrucy:\nApollo! Your hand's shaking!\nApollo:\n(Ugh... Grrrah! Let's do this!)\nApollo:\n(Wow... it really works!)\nTrucy:\nThis must be... this must be the power of science!\nEma:\nIt says... \"IPXX314206\"... ...Is that the killer's name?\nJudge:\nHmm. Maybe it is... if the killer was a robot!\nKlavier:\nAh hah! I have it!\nApollo:\n...So what is it?\nKlavier:\nI thought those letters \"IPXX\" looked familiar. This is an Interpol ID number.\nEma:\nI-Interpol? You mean the international police agency?\nKlavier:\nYes. Most are undercover agents working to solve international crimes. But why would he write that number...?\nApollo:\nWhy would Mr. LeTouse even know a number like that!?\nKlavier:\nGood show, Fräulein Detective. Rock on.\nEma:\nEh?\nKlavier:\nYour Honor! We can verify this number immediately. ...Daryan, are you there? Come up to the witness stand!\nKlavier:\nDaryan... you heard what we need. Go check into this Interpol ID number.\nDaryan:\nSure thing. Gimme 30 minutes. No... Gimme 27.\nJudge:\nHmm... I'm not sure what to think of all this. The prosecution's case is airtight, or so it seems. Yet if this number is really that of an Interpol agent...\nEma:\nOh, wait, I know... What if Machi Tobaye's really an undercover Interpol agent?\nKlavier:\nThat would be a possibility.\nJudge:\nA possibility, yes. And one that would mark him as the killer for certain.\nApollo:\n(Why did LeTouse know an Interpol ID number...? That's what I want to know.)\nKlavier:\nWell, we have some time while we await Daryan's report. Let's work on unraveling another mystery, shall we? A curious mystery concerning Machi Tobaye.\nApollo:\n...What are you talking about?\nKlavier:\nFräulein Detective, please accept my apologies. I received word that the defendant could, in fact, see, just before the trial began. It seemed too much of a bother to tell you.\nEma:\n...You had me until that last bit.\nKlavier:\nDoes this not raise a rather straightforward question?\nEma:\nWell, sure... Why did Machi pretend he couldn't see?\nKlavier:\nExactly... It makes little sense. What do you think, Herr Forehead?\nApollo:\nHuh? Me?\nKlavier:\nMachi Tobaye pretended he was blind... ...Do you know why?\nEma:\nHow could he know!?\nTrucy:\nWait... Prosecutor Gavin knows why, doesn't he...\nApollo:\n(He's known from the start of the trial. He's been leading us on the whole time!)\nKlavier:\nHmm? Something wrong? Do you think, perhaps, this is all some kind of game? Know that the moment I heard that report... ...I knew why.\nJudge:\nHmm... I suppose people who have sold over a million records really are something else.\nApollo:\n(What does that have to do with anything!?)\nKlavier:\nThere was a reason why Machi Tobaye pretended to be blind. But it wasn't for his own sake. ...Getting the picture now?\nApollo:\nIt wasn't for himself...!?\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Justice? Can you present evidence that shows us why the defendant had to feign blindness?\nEma:\nYeah! Wasn't she supposed to be the \"landscape painter in sound\" or something?\nKlavier:\nWell, since we have her here...\nEma:\n!\nKlavier:\n...Why not ask Lamiroir herself? I believe she is still in the witness waiting room.\nTrucy:\nA-Apollo, what does this mean for our case!?\nApollo:\nDon't ask me! I had no idea she couldn't see... I hadn't even imagined it until now!\nJudge:\nBailiff! Bring in Lamiroir!\nKlavier:\n...Lamiroir. It pains me deeply to call you before us again in this way. And yet I must.\nLamiroir:\nPlease, do not be concerned on my behalf.\nApollo:\n(Those eyes... She really can't see? Really?)\nLamiroir:\n...... It is true.\nApollo:\n...!\nLamiroir:\nHow funny it is that a tiny lie born in the Borginian countryside... ...would one day grow to entangle the entire world.\nJudge:\nSo... So you are...!?\nLamiroir:\nYes. As I mentioned before... ...I have no memory of the time before I became Lamiroir. Know too that my memories begin in darkness. The word \"light\" has no meaning for Lamiroir.\nJudge:\nI see...\nKlavier:\nYou may recall me saying something toward the beginning of this trial, Herr Forehead.\nApollo:\n...? What's that?\nKlavier:\nI believe I said it was unfortunate this crime had no \"direct\" witnesses.\nApollo:\nAh...\nKlavier:\nNow, Lamiroir, I must ask you to stand once more. Will you testify to the court about your eyes?\nLamiroir:\nOf course. It was never my intent to deceive any of you. May I begin, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nUh, yes, yes of course... Though I admit, I'm a little lost here.\nApollo:\nI think we're all a bit lost here, Your Honor.\nWitness Testimony\n-- Lamiroir's Eyes --\nLamiroir:\nI have no memory of the \"light\".\nI debuted in a world of darkness and sound...\nMy producer came up with my PR line before he knew this.\nSo, silly as it may sound, I had to pretend I could see.\nEveryone on my staff knew, of course, but no others.\nJudge:\nBut... this is a murder trial!\nLamiroir:\nI apologize. It was part of my contract, you see. I was to keep my blindness a secret, no matter what. Music is everything for me. I never imagined something like this would...\nKlavier:\nShe told us the truth in the beginning. When she said she \"saw nothing\".\nJudge:\nVery well. Does the defense have anything to add?\nApollo:\n...... I'd like to cross-examine.\nTrucy:\nBut, what is there left to ask!?\nApollo:\nThere was one thing in her testimony that bothered me.\nKlavier:\nPerhaps it is best we let you get it out of your system. Someday you'll come to understand... ...the importance of thinking for yourself.\nJudge:\nVery well. The defense may proceed. However... Be aware this court will not tolerate any questions deemed too stressful to the witness.\nApollo:\n...OK. (There was only one part that bothered me... Just let me ask about that and I'll be happy.)\nCross Examination\n-- Lamiroir's Eyes --\nLamiroir:\nI have no memory of the \"light\".\nLamiroir:\nI debuted in a world of darkness and sound...\nLamiroir:\nMy producer came up with my PR line before he knew this.\nLamiroir:\nSo, silly as it may sound, I had to pretend I could see.\nLamiroir:\nEveryone on my staff knew, of course, but no others.\nApollo:\n(I suppose that's her confession, of sorts. There's just one part that bothers me... ...And I'm going to get to the bottom of it.)\nApollo:\nWhen you say your staff, do you include Mr. LeTouse?\nLamiroir:\nOf course. He was my manager.\nApollo:\n(So he knew... and that's what's been bugging me!)\nJudge:\nSomething the matter, Mr. Justice?\nKlavier:\nI believe I know what is bothering our young defense attorney. ...You are thinking of when you discovered the body, yes?\nApollo:\n...!\nTrucy:\nIs he right, Apollo?\nApollo:\n...Yes, I was.\nLeTouse:\n......Nnnh......\nApollo:\n...! (He... He's alive!) Mr. LeTouse! Can you hear me!?\nLeTouse:\n...Cold... so cold... Witness...\nApollo:\nYou're cold? D-Don't worry, you're going to be fine! Help is on the way!\nLeTouse:\n...Can't s...see...\nApollo:\nHang in there, Mr. LeTouse! Tell me, who was the witness?\nLeTouse:\nThe wi...witness...is ...si...si...ren...\nApollo:\nMr. LeTouse told me to ask the witness, and he named you.\nLamiroir:\n...!\nApollo:\nWhy would he do that? He knew you were blind!\nLamiroir:\nI... I don't know...\nKlavier:\nTsk, tsk.\nApollo:\n...!\nKlavier:\nWhat did I just say? You need to learn to think for yourself.\nApollo:\nMeaning what...?\nKlavier:\nThere is no mystery here if you recall everything he said. Think of his last words once more.\nJudge:\n\"The witness... siren\"? We've heard them many times. Along with a little play-acting by our defense.\nKlavier:\nI remember them well myself, but that statement is not to what I refer. I mean what he said before that.\nApollo:\n...Before? (What came before that...?) Ack!\nKlavier:\n...That's right. He tried to tell you. When he said \"can't see\" he wasn't talking about himself. He was talking about the witness!\nJudge:\nI see!\nKlavier:\nToo bad the defense did not. Well, Herr Forehead? Try relaxing and \"looking\" at the facts first next time.\nApollo:\n...Urk!\nJudge:\nOrder! Order!\nKlavier:\nRecall Lamiroir's earlier testimony...\nLamiroir:\nI was on my way from the stage to the backstage exit. There were two shots... I couldn't do anything to stop it.\nJudge:\nBut she couldn't have heard those gunshots! I thought we proved that...\nKlavier:\nThat is not the most important point here.\nJudge:\nHmm?\nKlavier:\nThe moment he was shot, Mr. LeTouse \"witnessed\" her through that window. ...Why else would he have named her as the witness?\nApollo:\nAh...\nLamiroir:\nBut I really did hear them! Two gunshots... and the man's voice!\nKlavier:\nUnfortunately, such a thing was impossible. The window was closed. We have already run a simulation, of course.\nLamiroir:\nBut it was so clear... If I heard that voice again, I would know it in an instant...\nJudge:\nHmm...\nBailiff:\n...Your Honor!\nJudge:\nWhat is it, Bailiff? Can't you see we're in session here!?\nBailiff:\nWe have the results back from the investigation!\nJudge:\nThe investigation...?\nKlavier:\nAh, the Interpol number that Mr. LeTouse left us.\nJudge:\n...! Well let's hear it! ...We will continue this cross-examination afterward. Detective Crescend! Your report please!\nDaryan:\nI asked Interpol about that number. I'm sure you'll find their answer intriguing.\nKlavier:\n...Quick work as always, Daryan.\nJudge:\nWell, tell us about the number! Is the defendant a secret agent!?\nDaryan:\n\"IPXX314206\"... The agent registered under that number... ...was Romein LeTouse.\nKlavier:\nWhat...?\nDaryan:\nOur undercover Interpol agent was Mr. LeTouse himself! He was apparently in the middle of an operation.\nApollo:\nSo, when he wrote those letters...\nDaryan:\n...He was trying to tell us his own identity. And a cautious killer tried to wipe them away.\nTrucy:\nMr. LeTouse was an undercover Interpol agent... So him being Lamiroir's manager...\nApollo:\n...Was just a cover, most likely.\nDaryan:\nThere's one other important detail I found.\nKlavier:\nWell, out with it.\nDaryan:\nIt concerns that 45-caliber revolver, the murder weapon. Apparently, it belonged to Romein LeTouse. He had an Interpol permit to carry firearms. ...And the registration number on the revolver matched.\nKlavier:\nSo the victim was killed with his own weapon, which makes sense. It's hard to imagine someone who wasn't an Interpol agent with such a large revolver.\nApollo:\n(So the victim was an Interpol agent on an undercover op... I wonder how that ties into everything.)\nTrucy:\nIt's got to tie in somehow, you'd think.\nApollo:\nYeah, somehow...\nJudge:\nThanks for looking into that for us, Detective Crescend. It's a great help.\nDaryan:\nOh, no problem at all, Your Honor. ...I'll be heading out...\n???:\nLamiroir:\nWait!\nJudge:\nLa-Lamiroir! Is something the matter?\nLamiroir:\nThat voice just now...\nKlavier:\nDaryan?\nLamiroir:\nMr. Daryan, is it...? ............ It was him. I am sure of it.\nJudge:\nIt was \"him\"?\nKlavier:\nY-You aren't saying--!?\nLamiroir:\nThat voice I heard, talking to Mr. LeTouse... when I heard the gunshots fired. It was him! It was Mr. Daryan!\nKlavier:\nIs this some kind of a joke!?\nApollo:\nWhaaaaaaaat!?\nDaryan:\n...No way...\nApollo:\n(The courtroom fell into such a chaotic state, the trial had to be suspended temporarily. I'd never seen that happen before. Of course, it's not every day that you get an accusation like that one. Lamiroir, fingering Daryan Crescend. Not only is he a guitarist, he's a detective! Could it really have been his voice Lamiroir heard? Things were changing fast, and frankly, I wasn't sure I could keep up with it.)\nTrucy:\nHey! No wimping out now, Apollo!\nTo be continued.July 9, 2:12 PMWright Anything Agency\nTrucy:\nHey, hey, Apollo!\nApollo:\nWhat?\nTrucy:\nUm, well, you know... ...Um, actually, nothing. I mean, something. ...Or maybe not.\nApollo:\nOut with it. The suspense is giving me an ulcer.\nTrucy:\nWell, you know, the trial today? I was thinking... If you gave it a score, what score would you give it?\nApollo:\nScore? Um, gee... I guess I would... um, or maybe... well... ...Bah. I'm just as bad as you.\nTrucy:\nSee? It's so... so vague!\nApollo:\nClearly. Machi avoided a guilty verdict, which is something. Though I can't say I'm any less confused about the case.\nDaryan:\nI asked Interpol about that number. I'm sure you'll find their answer intriguing. \"IPXX314206\"... The agent registered under that number... ...was Romein LeTouse.\nApollo:\nAnd the victim, Mr. LeTouse... Who would have guessed he was actually an undercover Interpol agent!? ...What a mess. And we don't have any idea what he was investigating.\nTrucy:\nWell, true, but we know who shot him now! Lamiroir told the whole court!\nLamiroir:\nWait! That voice just now... ............ It was him. I am sure of it. That voice I heard, talking to Mr. LeTouse... when I heard the gunshots fired. It was him! It was Mr. Daryan!\nTrucy:\nIt's another mystery, Apollo! I love mysteries.\nApollo:\nI don't. Speaking of mysteries, what's Mr. Wright up to? I wouldn't mind asking his opinion.\nTrucy:\nNow that you mention it, I haven't seen Daddy around.\nApollo:\nWhat, is he some kind of stray that just wanders in and out at will?\nTrucy:\nI wouldn't say that, but he has been going out a lot. Some \"top-secret mission\", he said.\nApollo:\nTop secret...?\nTrucy:\nAnyway, you can't just rely on him to save the day! And you've got me to help you. We'll be fine!\nApollo:\nFine... right. Well, time's a-wasting, as they say. Let's investigate.\nTrucy:\nThat's the spirit!\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\n???:\nAhhh ha ha ha ha haa!\nApollo:\n......\nTrucy:\n......\nApollo:\nUm, Trucy? Was that another one of your tricks?\nTrucy:\nIt wasn't me! I can't even make Mr. Hat laugh like that!\n???:\n...Wherever the mundane gives way to miracles, a word is whispered... Gramarye!\nTrucy:\nHey! The other day...\nTrucy:\nEeeeeeeeeeeeek!\nApollo:\nWho's there!?\nTrucy:\nWe... didn't just imagine that, did we?\nApollo:\nHe was wearing a silk hat. ...Friend of yours?\nTrucy:\nHardly!\n???:\nWe meet again!\nApollo:\nAh, um, nice to meet you. Who... are you? (And could you please stop smirking like that?)\nTrucy:\nAh. Ahhhhhhh! It's you!!! Uncle Valant!\nApollo:\nUncle Valant...? He's your uncle!?\nTrucy:\nNo, silly! It's the Great Gramarye, Valant Gramarye! The Grand Magician!\nValant:\nYes, it is I, the Great Valant Gramarye. As seen on television.\nApollo:\n(And could you please stop smirking like that?)\nValant:\nIt's been a while, Miss Trucy. Seven years to be exact! My, how you've grown!\nTrucy:\nGood to see you again, Uncle Valant! You... look exactly the same!\nApollo:\nUm, I hate to intrude, but... What is a Great Magician doing paying us a visit?\nValant:\nI believe it was you who wished to see me? So, be quick with your questions! And do not quail, quake, or quiver. I am quite tame. Though my stardom may sear the sight... I'm quite down to earth when need calls.\nApollo:\n(He does have a certain aura to him, it's true.)\nTrucy:\nLet's ask him about the case, Apollo!\nApollo:\n(His \"aura\" sure isn't lost on our magician-in-the-making. She's practically drooling with enthusiasm.)\nTrucy:\nAfter all... ...Uncle Valant's one of Daddy's best friends! That's why I call him \"uncle\".\nApollo:\nWh-What? Daddy... you mean Mr. Wright...?\nTrucy:\nNo, I mean... My real Daddy.\nApollo:\n...! (Trucy's real father!?)\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nValant:\n...Ach, I've been remiss in remembering my reasons for my visit.\nApollo:\nReasons?\nValant:\nTwo, in fact! The first being, of course... ...to see you, Miss Trucy.\nTrucy:\nYou don't know how happy I am to see you again, Uncle Valant!\nValant:\nI'm sure you are.\nApollo:\n...Not one for modesty, are you?\nValant:\nWhen I encountered you at the Coliseum... the first time in seven years... ...I could fain not contain my emotions! I wept oceans! (Chagned from [...I could fain contain my emotions! I wept oceans!] in the original release) And to learn you now defend that poor pianist, that blinded boy! 'Twas a hot topic of talk amongst the staff, you know. And defend him you did!\nTrucy:\nEh heh. Well, it wasn't all my doing.\nApollo:\nUm, I'm his defense attorney, actually.\nValant:\nMy other reason for coming here today... was this.\nTrucy:\nThat's... a video tape?\nValant:\nQuite so. A recording of the concert, no less. I've brought it for you, Trucy, on behalf of Troupe Gramarye. Will you watch it?\nSugar, Sugar...O that night, in your embrace.\nWhen you stole away the keysmy heart held on to so tight.\nPleasure...But a fleeting melody\nIt wraps itself around me,And now through the air I fly.\nWoh... Woh...\nBurning on in my heart. Fire.Burn my love away. All away.\nLike a bullet of love. Fire.Take my life away. All away.\n\nGuitar, Guitar...Up together to the sky.\nTrucy:\nWow... It's almost as good as it was live. So... what's the word? Mysterious...\nApollo:\n(There are more mysterious things than her song going on... Way more mysterious...)\nValant:\nAh ha ha ha ha...!\nApollo:\n(This Valant Gramarye has good reasons to be here today... But I wonder what his \"reasons\" were to be at that concert?)\nVideo Tape received from Valant.\nApollo:\nSo, I was wondering... That stunt in the middle of the song there...\nTrucy:\nI didn't see a stunt...\nApollo:\nWhat about Lamiroir vanishing and reappearing!?\nTrucy:\nOh, that? I guess I'm so used to seeing that happen I didn't even notice.\nApollo:\n(So young to be so jaded...)\nValant:\nA simple sleight-of-hand, a petite prestidigitation. (Changed from [A simple slight-of-hand [sic], a petit prestidigitation.] in the original release) A modicum of magic from me... to you.\nTrucy:\nSo that's why you were at the concert!\nValant:\nYes. I was there to watch my trick take to the air...\nApollo:\nSo you're the one who knows how it was all done.\nValant:\nOf course. I am like a deity, with the stage as my domain! I suffer no mystery upon those floodlit boards not grasped tightly 'twixt my fingers. It is a potent, primeval power I possess.\nApollo:\nUm... Well... Do you think you could... ...tell me how it was done!?\nTrucy:\nHey now!\nApollo:\nTrucy...?\nTrucy:\nThat's like, totally against the rules, Apollo!\nApollo:\nNot during a murder investigation, it's not!\nValant:\nMais non, for my illusions are mine alone, m'sieur. Also...\nApollo:\nAlso what?\nValant:\nRecall that the terrible occurrence happened later. Well after my illusion entranced the audience.\nApollo:\nOh.\nValant:\nDon't even ask. I won't answer.\nTrucy:\nToo bad for you, Apollo!\nApollo:\n(Grr. Whose side are you on?)\nValant:\n...I, Valant Gramarye, now make my leave, Miss Trucy.\nTrucy:\nThere's no need to rush, Uncle Valant! You should stay a while!\nValant:\nI am afraid I cannot. I may not. I shall not. I have been asked to assist with an analysis and so I shall slink back to the scene.\nApollo:\nSo... you'll be at the concert venue today?\nValant:\nCorrect. If you would call on me, come to the Coliseum! See you later, crocodile.\nApollo:\n(With a whir of his cloak, and a wink of his eye... ...he turned and walked out through the door. Normally.)\nTrucy:\nWell, there you go, Apollo! Let's get cracking!\nApollo:\n...Right. (Valant Gramarye... I've got a few more things to ask him. Foremost among them, that bit of magic that made Lamiroir disappear... ...And how he knows Trucy, and her \"real\" father...!)\nJuly 9Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nApollo:\n(Machi may not be guilty, but he's still a suspect.)\nTrucy:\nBut they don't have any decisive evidence!\nApollo:\nYeah, but only someone as small as him could have gotten out of that room.\nTrucy:\nRight... the air vent.\nApollo:\nAnd... he lied.\nTrucy:\nLied?\nApollo:\n(Machi Tobaye can see...)\nMachi:\n....................\nTrucy:\nAh! Machi!\nApollo:\nSpeak of the devil.\nMachi:\n....................\nTrucy:\nHe looks like he's doing OK!\nApollo:\nI forget. Why did we come here? It's not like we can talk to him or anything.\nTrucy:\nWords are overrated! Feelings are what matter, Apollo.\nApollo:\nIt's kinda hard to build a court case on feelings. But, since we're here, anyway. Might as well get what I want to say off my chest.\nTrucy:\nIf you need someone to complain to, I'll listen...\nApollo:\n(I think she's actually worried for me...)\nMachi:\n.....................\nAfter clearing \"The trial today\" and \"Lamiroir's testimony\" Talk options:\nApollo:\n...I must be imagining it.\nTrucy:\nImagining what, Apollo?\nApollo:\nIt's just, I couldn't help but feel that... I dunno. Machi... ...He doesn't understand what we're saying, right?\nTrucy:\nHow could he? He's a young Borginian! He doesn't speak English.\nApollo:\nYeah, but my bracelet is reacting to him.\nTrucy:\nHuh? Maybe it's malfunctioning? Or it's scared, because you keep making those \"I'm so mad\" faces.\nApollo:\nWas I that bad? (Machi lied about not being able to see... But what if that's not all he lied about?)\nTrucy:\nIf you're curious about it there's only one thing to do. You should ask him.\nApollo:\n(I think it'll take something big to get to him... Some kind of undeniable evidence.) ...We'll be back, Machi.\nMachi:\n........................\nJuly 9Sunshine Coliseum\nTrucy:\nWoo! What a great day! It's perfect weather for sleuthing!\nApollo:\nThe weather matters for an investigation?\nTrucy:\nDon't some days just feel like \"magic\" days or \"defense\" days?\nApollo:\nUm, sure. Let's get started, shall we?\nTrucy:\nRight on! Show us your stuff, Apollo!\nApollo:\nUm, what stuff?\nTrucy:\nYour voice training! This is the perfect place for it!\nApollo:\nI did enough at home, thanks.\nTrucy:\nAw, there's no need to be shy! Keep that up and you'll never make it on the big stage!\nApollo:\nI'm happy in the courtroom, thank you. I am a lawyer.\nTrucy:\nThen you're in luck, because it's lawyer weather today! Don't you just want to face the blue sky and shout, \"Objection!\"?\nApollo:\nLook, the weather has nothing to do with lawyers. Let's get going already!\nJuly 9Backstage Hallway\nLamiroir:\nAh, Mr. Attorney.\nApollo:\nLamiroir! I'm sorry about today... I...\nLamiroir:\nThere is nothing you need to apologize for. You were merely defending Machi.\nTrucy:\nUm... Are you OK? Alone, I mean.\nLamiroir:\nHumans are blessed with five senses. Even robbed of one, we get by. ...Though it does make being a witness rather difficult.\nTrucy:\nSpeaking of \"seeing\", you knew who we were before we spotted you just now. And we weren't even talking.\nLamiroir:\n...I heard your footsteps several times the day before.\nTrucy:\nOh... You must have great ears!\nApollo:\n(Ears that heard the crime taking place... Or so she claimed yesterday. ...But how?)\nAfter clearing all Talk options and presenting Video Tape:\nLamiroir:\nAh, I am reminded that I wished to speak to you about something.\nApollo:\nYes?\nLamiroir:\nWhen I was walking this hallway before... I stumbled upon a small device of some kind. It was lying on the floor.\nApollo:\nDevice...? Maybe you mean this?\nTrucy:\nThat's been lying there since the day before yesterday!\nLamiroir:\nMight I... touch it? ...... I thought as much.\nApollo:\nWhat? What did you think?\nLamiroir:\nThis is one of our headsets. Everyone on staff wears one during a concert.\nApollo:\nI wonder whose this is?\nLamiroir:\nWe use it for communication. It would be quite inconvenient should it go missing.\nApollo:\nWe'll hold on to it for you then. We'll give it to Prosecutor Gavin when we see him.\nLamiroir:\nYes, that's best. Thank you.\nTrucy:\nSo, can I put it on?\nHeadset attached to Trucy.\nTrucy:\n\"Attached\"? I'm not some kind of robot, Apollo!\nApollo:\n(Everyone on staff was wearing one of these headsets... This might warrant some further inquiry.)\nGavinners's Dressing Room\nLamiroir's Dressing Room\nThe Stage\nAfter presenting Video Tape to Valant Gramarye in Wright Anything Agency:\nJuly 9In the Wings\nTrucy:\nThat song... Isn't that the one Lamiroir was singing?\nApollo:\nYeah, you're right. \"The Guitar's Serenade\"...\nTrucy:\nWow, I'd love to do a show on a stage like this!\nApollo:\nI'd come to see that.\nTrucy:\nThe house is full, and as one, the audience sighs with wonderment! There I am, singing my ballad, rose petals swirling through the air...\nApollo:\nNot bad... wait. Aren't you a magician!?\nTrucy:\n...Oh. That's right. I was a magician, wasn't I.\nApollo:\n(Some dedication...)\nValant:\nAh ha! If it isn't Miss Trucy! And indeed it is!\nTrucy:\nUncle Valant!\nApollo:\nWhat exactly are you doing here?\nValant:\n...I take real responsibility in tasks undertaken. I am inspecting my equipment of illusion to make sure naught is amiss. (Changed from [I am inspecting my equipment of illusion to make sure naught is amiss, Miss.] in the original release)\nTrucy:\nThe Lamiroir Teleportation Illusion! Ooh!\nValant:\nShould anything go wrong, it would reflect poorly upon me and my troupe. As I went about my exacting examination, I happened to notice that piano. ...And I remembered that fair lady's melancholy melody.\nTrucy:\nHey Apollo, maybe Uncle Valant can shed some light on this whole thing for us!\nAfter presenting Headset in Backstage Hallway:\nJuly 9Lamiroir's Dressing Room\n...MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH...\nApollo:\nUh oh... There's only one person I know who can munch with such... venom.\nEma:\n...What are you doing here?\nApollo:\nHello, Ema. You're looking as grumpy as ever.\nEma:\nOh, am I supposed to be happy? You give me the second degree in court, and Prosecutor Gavin makes me look like a fool.\nApollo:\n...You're talking about the blood stain Mr. LeTouse left?\nEma:\nMy department chief had a field day with that one. \"Even a blind person could see the shooter wasn't blind!\" Funny guy, huh?\nTrucy:\nBut that blood stain helped uncover the biggest mystery of all!\nApollo:\nNow we know that Mr. LeTouse was really with Interpol.\nTrucy:\nWe wouldn't have found that out without you!\nEma:\nI suppose. Maybe that's why the chief gave me these after he was finished chewing me out. Said it was my reward.\nApollo:\n...Are chocolate Snackoos popular down at the precinct or something?\nEma:\n...MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH...\nTrucy:\n...I was hoping we could check out the crime scene again.\nEma:\nBe my guest. You're not going to find any clues in here. ...Though I did find something strange.\nTrucy:\nSomething strange?\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nEma:\n...Guess I'd best be getting on with my investigation.\nApollo:\nWe're off to look for more clues elsewhere, then.\nEma:\nI feel better just knowing what this thing is now. I'll have to look into igniters a bit more later.\nTrucy:\nGood luck!\nApollo:\n(I'd like to know a bit more about igniters myself...)\nIgniter added to the Court Record.\nAfter clearing all Talk options in Lamiroir's Dressing Room and In the Wings, and clearing \"The trial today\" and \"Lamiroir's testimony\" Talk options in Detention Center - Visitor's Room:\nJuly 9Sunshine Coliseum\nDaryan:\nWhat? Come to laugh at the murderer?\nTrucy:\nDaryan...\nDaryan:\nThat old bag opens her pie hole, and wham-bam my life goes down the chute. Thanks! They won't let me work while I'm a suspect!\nTrucy:\nDaryan isn't in the best of moods, is he?\nApollo:\nNot many people are these days, it seems.\nTrucy:\nIt is a crime scene. Not exactly the happiest place to hang out.\nDaryan:\nThen Gavin had to go rub salt in the wound... My alibi's rock solid. Rock solid!\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nApollo:\nCome to think of it, I haven't seen Prosecutor Gavin around much.\nDaryan:\nOh, him? He's down at the prosecutor's office, most likely.\nApollo:\nThe prosecutor's office... (I've never been there, have I.)\nDaryan:\nThe data on the victim should have come in from Interpol. ...Normally, I'd be down there dealing with it. Normally.\nTrucy:\nApollo! Let's go check it out! I've always wanted to see the prosecutor's office.\nApollo:\nHmm... Maybe that's not such a bad idea.\nTrucy:\nRight on!\nDaryan:\nSay \"hi\" for me, OK? Oh, and \"screw you\". And tell him I want into that crime scene!\nApollo:\n...Um, we'll be going now.\nDaryan:\nHey, wait.\nApollo:\nY...Yes?\nDaryan:\nWhat do you really think happened? Really? You don't think I did it, right?\nApollo:\nW-Well...\nDaryan:\nGreat. Way to instill a guy with some confidence. Just remember, I was ripping it up on stage when it happened, OK? Ripping!\nApollo:\n...!\nDaryan:\nDon't get led astray by some siren song, eh? Get this one wrong, and you'll be eating humble pie for a year. I'll bake it myself.\nTrucy:\nLet's... not talk to him anymore. Alright?\nApollo:\n(Detective Daryan Crescend... He's one stone I'd leave unturned if I had a choice.)\nJuly 9Backstage Hallway\nApollo:\n...This place is deserted.\nTrucy:\nI wonder where Lamiroir went off to?\nApollo:\nI'm sure she's OK on her own. She seems resourceful.\nTrucy:\nI guess... But I can't help worry about her a little.\nJuly 9Prosecutor Gavin's Office\nTrucy:\nSo... this is it. The Gavinners's head office.\nApollo:\nIt's not the band's office. It's the prosecutor's office.\nKlavier:\nYeah, so that's why I am asking, what is this creepy thing... object... whatever.\nApollo:\n...Looks like Prosecutor Gavin is on the phone.\nTrucy:\nOh well, guess we'll have to come back. Or we can hide behind that bookshelf real quiet-like...\nApollo:\n...That's eavesdropping.\nTrucy:\nWhy? We'd just be waiting. Quietly. So he won't notice. (Changed from [Why? We'd just be waiting. Quietly. So he didn't notice.] in the original release) What if we heard something scandalous about the band!?\nApollo:\n(She'd make a good reporter... for a gossip mag.)\nKlavier:\nWhat? A \"replica\"...? So why was he after it in the first place? Yeah, LeTouse!\nApollo:\n(LeTouse...?)\nKlavier:\nLook, don't talk to me about those Borginians, OK? Just get me that report, chop chop. ...And stop leaving mysterious objects in my office, OK?\n...*beep*...\nKlavier:\nIt's times like this when I start to miss Daryan... ...Huh?\nApollo:\nErm, hiya!\nTrucy:\nTee hee! Just thought we'd drop in. Hope you're not mad...?\nKlavier:\n...How could I be? There's not enough \"tee hee\" in the world, in any case. Have a seat.\nApollo:\n(Prosecutor Gavin, the philanthropist.)\nTrucy:\nWatch and learn, Apollo!\nKlavier:\nSo, who have you come to see?\nTrucy:\nHuh?\nKlavier:\nKlavier, lead vocalist for the Gavinners? Or Prosecutor Gavin, scourge of the courtroom?\nTrucy:\nWhat do you think he means, Apollo?\nApollo:\nI think he's giving us a choice. We can either ask him about the concert... or the case. (Which way to go?)\nAfter clearing all Talk options and correctly presenting Igniter:\nKlavier:\nI believe that covers everything I'm at liberty to talk to you about.\nApollo:\nOh.\nKlavier:\nThanks for dropping by, ...Herr Forehead.\nApollo:\nThanks...?\nKlavier:\nWhy, you gave me so much information! That igniter, for instance...\nApollo:\nOh. That.\nKlavier:\nI've never met an attorney so forthcoming with the prosecution. It's a big help. ...Or perhaps you're just a tad naïve, hmm?\nApollo:\n(...I guess I could have hid it, but somehow, showing it felt like the right thing.) I could say the same... to you, Prosecutor Gavin.\nKlavier:\n...?\nApollo:\nThanks for the information. About the, er, strange lump of plastic. The one that Mr. LeTouse was investigating.\nTrucy:\nHey, that's right...\nKlavier:\nI've been thinking, Herr Forehead. We encounter many incidents in our lives, all of us. Not all of them simple.\nApollo:\n...Especially not the ones where people are killing to song lyrics.\nKlavier:\nThat is why I try to at least remain simple inside. And I keep a simple goal: to discover the truth.\nApollo:\n......\nKlavier:\nThat's why I like to keep relations civil, ja? ...That is all.\nApollo:\n...I can live with that.\nTrucy:\nUm... Mr. Prosecutor?\nKlavier:\nFräulein?\nTrucy:\nCan I ask you why you sing in a band?\nKlavier:\nAh. Because I want women to turn and look when I walk down the street.\nApollo:\nThat's pretty simple, too.\nKlavier:\nNow if you'll excuse me, I've got work to do. Another time, perhaps.\nAfter examining glass case in Prosecutor Gavin's Office:\nJuly 9Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nTrucy:\nLooks like Machi is in questioning.\nApollo:\nHuh, the police must have a Borginian interpreter. That's no fair. I wish we could talk to him.\nTrucy:\nI guess we'll just have to come back later if we want to see him.\nApollo:\nI guess so.\nJuly 9Sunshine Coliseum\nEma:\n...Oh, it's you. You came at a good time.\nApollo:\nHello there, Ema. What's up?\nEma:\nEither of you know where Lamiroir is?\nApollo:\nUm... well, I saw her in the backstage hallway a while ago.\nEma:\nYeah? That's strange...\nTrucy:\nWhat's strange?\nEma:\nI can't find her anywhere. I was supposed to bring her to the prosecutor's office...\nApollo:\n(Lamiroir's missing!?)\nEma:\nIt's hard to imagine her wandering off somewhere on her own. ...Being that she's blind and all.\nApollo:\nYeah. We'll help you look for her.\nEma:\nGreat! Thanks.\nJuly 9, 4:46 PMIn the Wings\nTrucy:\nHuh? The stage is pitch dark!\nApollo:\nThe power breaker must be off for this section... Great.\nTrucy:\nI'll go get someone! Yipes, it was really dark out there.\nApollo:\nDark... That's all Lamiroir has, when you think about it. (What would it be like to live in a world of darkness?)\nTrucy:\n...Hey, Apollo.\nApollo:\nHuh? What?\nTrucy:\n...Doesn't something about the stage seem different to you? Like, something's changed?\nApollo:\nChanged?\nTrucy:\nI can't put my finger on it, but it's bugging me.\nApollo:\n(Now it's bugging me, too! What's she talking about?)\nTrucy:\nHey, that case... Wasn't that open before?\nApollo:\nHuh. I guess someone closed it.\nTrucy:\nWait... Look! Where the case closes...\nApollo:\nSomething's sticking out! That... doesn't look like an instrument. You don't think it's...\nTrucy:\nLet's open it, Apollo! Eeeeeeeek! Lamiroir! Lamiroooooooir!\nApollo:\nEma! We have to get Ema!\nApollo:\n(Lamiroir was taken directly to the hospital. Ema ran around, barking orders, making phone calls. Trucy just clung to my arm and cried... And me, I was still in shock. Two bodies in two days is two too many.)\nJuly 9, 5:53 PMHickfield ClinicWaiting Room\nTrucy:\nEma! How's Lamiroir? Is she OK?\nEma:\nAh, you. We all owe you a big \"thanks\", that's for sure.\nTrucy:\nSo... she's OK?\nEma:\nYes. She came to a short while ago. You found her before it was too late.\nTrucy:\nTh-That's good to hear...\nApollo:\nSo, what happened!?\nEma:\nSomeone attacked her. ...She was struck on the forehead.\nApollo:\nBy who!?\nEma:\nWe don't know.\nTrucy:\nBut they hit her on the forehead, right? That's right in front of her! How could she not see... Oh.\nEma:\nRight. Would you like to see her now?\nApollo:\nIs that alright?\nEma:\nShe wants to thank you for saving her life.\nApollo:\nLamiroir!\nLamiroir:\nAh, Mr. Attorney. You were the one who found me? Thank you from the bottom of my heart.\nApollo:\nI-I'm just glad you're OK. Tell me, what happened?\nLamiroir:\n......\nAfter clearing all Talk options:\nApollo:\n(Cocoon smuggling... And Mr. LeTouse had Lamiroir marked... Hmm...) ...It couldn't be her.\nTrucy:\nHuh?\nApollo:\n(There's one other person I need to talk to!) Thank you for talking to us, Lamiroir!\nLamiroir:\nIt was the least I could do.\nApollo:\nActually, I have another request.\nLamiroir:\nIf it is within my power...\nApollo:\nI need an interpreter. Someone who speaks Borginian.\nTrucy:\nApollo...?\nLamiroir:\n......\nApollo:\nWould you come with us, if you're well enough?\nLamiroir:\nI see... Yes, yes of course. I shall accompany you.\nTrucy:\nHuh? Where are we going?\nApollo:\nC'mon, Trucy. We're about to get to the bottom of this!\nJuly 9Detention CenterVisitor's Room\nApollo:\nMachi... We came to talk to you about the case.\nLamiroir:\nMachi...\nMachi:\n! ................\nApollo:\nCould you interpret for us, Lamiroir?\nLamiroir:\nYes.\nApollo:\nMachi... I'd like to talk to you about when we first met. ...When we still thought you were blind.\nLamiroir:\n[Foreign text]....\nMachi:\n....................\nApollo:\nNow we know the truth. You can see, right?\nTrucy:\nI was completely fooled, myself.\nApollo:\nMachi... Isn't there another secret you're hiding from us?\nMachi:\n......!\nLamiroir:\nWait, Mr. Attorney! What do you mean by \"secret\"?\nMachi:\n............\nApollo:\nWhat do I mean by \"secret\"? Well...\nApollo:\nIf I'm not mistaken... ...you know something about this, don't you!?\nMachi:\n......!\nTrucy:\nHey, you got a reaction! A big one!\nLamiroir:\nMachi, you didn't...!\nApollo:\n...Trucy and I are trained to see people's uncertainty. Not that we would have needed any training to see that one.\nMachi:\n....................\nLamiroir:\nMr. Attorney, please tell me what this is all about!\nApollo:\nLamiroir, please, interpret!\nLamiroir:\n...Very well.\nApollo:\nI know you know something about this by your reaction. If you won't tell me, I might have to give it to the prosecution... ...and have them look into it!\nMachi:\n! .................... [Foreign text]!\nLamiroir:\nHe asks you to \"wait, do not be so hasty.\"\nTrucy:\nM-Machi...?\nMachi:\n.................... [Foreign text]....[Foreign text]?\nLamiroir:\n\"Do you know everything?\"\nApollo:\n...Yes, everything. Well, sort of.\nTrucy:\nHave him tell us about it!\nMachi:\n....[Foreign text]....\nLamiroir:\n\"Very well\"...\nTrucy:\nWhat is this cocoon, anyway?\nMachi:\n[Foreign text]....\nLamiroir:\n\"The cocoon, the silk, is a potent cure.\"\nTrucy:\nA cure...?\nApollo:\nIt must cure some disease.\nMachi:\n[Foreign text]....\nLamiroir:\nIt's a cure for \"Incuritis\".\nApollo:\nA cure for Incuritis?\nReplica updated in the Court Record.\nTrucy:\nBut, if it's a cure, why keep it in Borginia like that? Just think of all the lives they could save by sharing the medicine!\nMachi:\n....................\nLamiroir:\nI do not understand the reasons myself.\nApollo:\nOK, well, at least we know what it is: a cure. And Mr. LeTouse was after cocoon smugglers. Wait, was Machi...?\nLamiroir:\nMachi, you weren't...!\nTrucy:\nHe couldn't be a smuggler! He's so little!\nApollo:\nWell, you're only 15, and you're sort of a magician, aren't you?\nTrucy:\nWell, that's true. I am sort of a magician.\nApollo:\n(She said \"sort of\"! Oh, to have a copy of that security camera tape...)\nTrucy:\nWell, Machi? Are you... a smuggler?\nMachi:\n[Foreign text]....\nLamiroir:\n[Foreign text]!\nMachi:\n....................\nLamiroir:\nHe... won't tell me.\nTrucy:\nFirst he plays blind, now he plays dumb...\nApollo:\nI wonder... Do you think he brought a cocoon here to sell it to someone? If Machi really did bring one into the country... ...was he planning on making a deal for its sale?\nMachi:\n[Foreign text]....\nLamiroir:\n\"I can't go home\"...\nTrucy:\nCan't go home!?\nMachi:\n....[Foreign text]....[Foreign text] ....[Foreign text]....\nLamiroir:\n\"I can't go home to Borginia. I do not want to go home.\" The penalty for taking a cocoon from Borginia... is death.\nApollo:\n(That's right! It's punishable by death!)\nMachi:\n[Foreign text]........\nLamiroir:\n\"About the case...\"? What about the case?\nApollo:\n(He wants to tell us about Mr. LeTouse's death!?)\nMachi:\n[Foreign text], [Foreign text]....\n???:\nThis meeting's over.\nTrucy:\n...Daryan?\nApollo:\nWh-What do you mean? Visiting hours aren't over yet.\nDaryan:\nThere's a call for Machi from the Borginian Embassy. This meeting is over. ...Sorry.\nApollo:\nJust give us five more minutes. We can call them back after that.\nDaryan:\nSorry, no go. C'mon, piano-boy. We're leaving.\nTrucy:\nDaryan! Wait!\nDaryan:\n...I never liked you. Either of you.\nApollo:\nHuh...?\nTrucy:\nDarn it! We were so close! He was about to tell us! Hey, Apollo...\nApollo:\n(He didn't want us to hear what Machi had to say...)\nTrucy:\nApollo!\nApollo:\n(...And there can be only one reason why.)\nTrucy:\nWhy is everyone ignoring me!?\nApollo:\nOh, sorry! (This is it... I know who I'm after now. It all happens tomorrow... in court!)\nTo be continued.\nThe Stage (before clearing \"The Cocoon\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room)",

(And then there was yesterday...)Daryan:\nThis meeting is over. ...Sorry.Apollo:\nJust give us five more minutes. We can call them back after that.Daryan:\nSorry, no go. C'mon, piano-boy. We're leaving.Trucy:\nDaryan! Wait!Daryan:\n...I never liked you. Either of you.Apollo:\nHuh...?Trucy:\nDarn it! We were so close! He was about to tell us! Hey, Apollo...Apollo:\n(He didn't want us to hear what Machi had to say...)Apollo:\n(...And I think I know why. Time to bring down a little Justice!)...BANG!...Trucy:\nEeek!Apollo:\nWh-What was that!????:\nHe is heard but unseen...Trucy:\nWho's that talking...?Apollo:\n...Valant Gramarye! (...I exclaimed as he walked in through the door. Normally.) (Changed from [...Valant Gramarye! (...Using the door like an average muggle, no less.)] in the original release)Trucy:\nYou... aren't the witness today, are you, Uncle Valant?Valant:\nAh ha ha ha ha ha! A preposterous proposition. How could I stand to stand upon the stand? Why, my secrets would be free for the plucking! ...I might even have to sign autographs! That is why I intend to remain hidden for the entire day.Trucy:\nOoh, with vanishing magic!?Valant:\nIndeed! I will jump upon an express train, and express myself to the next town over! But before I go... a word of warning.Trucy:\nWarning...? What?Valant:\nA grand Gramarye glamour resides at the root of all that has happened. Do not forget this truth.Apollo:\nA... glamour?Valant:\nA spell, a sorcery... a great illusion! ...Miss Trucy, though it pains me to part so... ...I need to get in line for a ticket. Farewell!Trucy:\nAnd there he goes.Apollo:\nHe sure seemed happy about that illusion thing...Trucy:\nOh, big illusions are the bread and butter of a magician! You can't pull off a show without one! The big illusion is always a spectacle to remember! Usually, it involves cutting up things, like people or elephants... ...or the Eiffel Tower. Anything, really!Apollo:\nSo he was talking about what we saw at the concert.Trucy:\nLamiroir's disappearing act.Apollo:\nAnd Prosecutor Gavin's exploding guitar.Trucy:\nI wonder what he meant by it being at \"the root of all that has happened\"?Apollo:\nWell, it's about time. Shall we go?Bailiff:\nAh, excuse me, sir.Apollo:\nY-Yes?Bailiff:\nThe scheduled starting time for the trial has been changed. The trial will not be commencing until 10:30 AM. Sorry for the inconvenience.Apollo:\nHuh? Did something happen? This is a first...Bailiff:\nIt was by the judge's request. Some urgent personal business.Apollo:\n(Great. I bet he stayed up too late last night, watching courtroom dramas.)Bailiff:\nApparently, he's visiting the hospital again.Apollo:\nThe hospital?Bailiff:\nI believe it was mentioned that the Chief Justice's son is unwell. Apparently his condition worsened considerably this morning.Apollo:\nThe Chief Justice's son...Trucy:\nOh, that's right... Remember yesterday morning? The judge said he had to go visit him after the trial.Bailiff:\nThere's an article about it in the newspaper. If you care to read about it yourself...Newspaper Article added to the Court Record.Apollo:\n(\"Incuritis\"...? Where have I heard that before?)Trucy:\nI'll let you read that article for us, Apollo! Just leave the TV guide page to me!Apollo:\n...Try not to lose the page with the funnies if you can.July 10, 10:30 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:\nAhem. My apologies for the delay. Court is now in session for the trial of... erm, how do you say this name again?Klavier:\nMachi Tobaye... our suspect fortissimo.Judge:\n...Right. It's his trial, in any case.Apollo:\nThe defense is prepared, Your Honor.Klavier:\nThe prosecution... is ready to rock.Judge:\n......Apollo:\nI-Is something wrong, Your Honor?Judge:\nNo. Well, yes... It's just, I've been friends with the Chief Justice since we were students. It pains me to see him going through such a difficult time.Trucy:\n\"Incuritis\", was it? That article said there is no known cure!Klavier:\nHerr Judge, let me say, with all honesty, I feel your pain. But, now is not the time for tears. Now is the time... for law.Judge:\n...Indeed. We left off at quite the juncture yesterday.Daryan:\nI asked Interpol about that number. \"IPXX314206\"... The agent registered under this number... ...was Romein LeTouse.Judge:\nThanks for looking into that for us, Detective Crescend. It's a great help.Daryan:\nOh, no problem at all, Your Honor. ...I'll be heading out...???:Lamiroir:\nWait! That voice just now... ............ It was him. I am sure of it.Judge:\nIt was \"him\"?Lamiroir:\nThat voice I heard, talking to Mr. LeTouse... when I heard the gunshots fired. It was him! It was Mr. Daryan!Daryan:\n...No way...Klavier:\nQuite a sensational ending. Who would have thought Daryan would guest star in the season cliff-hanger... as a suspect?Judge:\nI asked the prosecution to look into this matter. ...Please tell the court your findings.Klavier:\nDaryan Crescend is a member of my band, the Gavinners... ...He is also a detective, making the current charges serious indeed. Yet, after investigation, I have found no cause to alter our case, or file new charges.Apollo:\n...And your reason is?Klavier:\nWeren't you aware, Herr Forehead? He has an impeccable alibi.Judge:\nAn alibi?Klavier:\nLet us review the facts again, shall we? The concert held on the night of the shooting was in three sets. The Gavinners ripped up the stage during the first set. For the second set, our guest took center stage... The only performers appearing were myself, Lamiroir, and Machi... ...along with a drummer and bassist, for a total of five. The shooting in the dressing room, however, took place during the third set. Lamiroir and the defendant, Machi Tobaye had left the stage at that point... ...and the Gavinners were already rocking. This is when two shots rang out at the scene of the crime. Shots heard by Detective Ema Skye, mind you.Trucy:\nAnd Apollo. You heard them too, right?Apollo:\nI sure did.Klavier:\nFurthermore, Lamiroir herself witnessed the moment of the crime... ...Well, perhaps I should say, she \"heard\" the moment of the crime. ...When she claims to have heard Mr. LeTouse and Detective Crescend \"talking\".Judge:\nB-But that's impossible! Detective Crescend was...Klavier:\nPrecisely. Detective Crescend was on stage, getting his groove on, no less. Voila. A perfect alibi!Judge:\nHmm. Does the defense have anything to add to this?Apollo:\n(It's true. When I heard those gunshots, he must have been on stage. Still, there's something here that doesn't quite add up...)Judge:\n...It appears the defense has no objections. I believe we can safely say that Daryan Crescend's alibi has been acknowledged.Klavier:\nWhich means that Lamiroir was sadly mistaken. Her testimony cannot be true.Judge:\nVery well. Of course, if we disregard her testimony... ...then I see no evidence keeping us from declaring a verdict. ...If indeed, there are no objections?Trucy:\nUh oh, Apollo! If he declares a verdict now...Apollo:\n(Ack! But Prosecutor Gavin's case is airtight! Lamiroir might have been lying to protect Machi! How can I rely on her testimony...? Wait... What about yesterday in the detention center...?)Machi:\n[Foreign text]........Lamiroir:\n\"About the case...\"? What about the case?Apollo:\n(He wants to tell us about Mr. LeTouse's death!?)Machi:\n[Foreign text], [Foreign text]....???:\nThis meeting's over.Trucy:\n...Daryan?Apollo:\n(Machi was trying to tell us something, I know it! ...Maybe the best thing to do is ask him... under oath!)Judge:\nVery well. The court finds the defendant, er, what was his name again?Apollo:Apollo:\nYour Honor!!!Judge:\nNo, that wasn't it. It was something like \"marquis\" or-- ...Mr. Justice?Apollo:\nYour Honor, before you declare a verdict, I would like to call another witness!Klavier:\nExactly who else do you need to hear from?Apollo:\nA witness who, until now, has not been given a chance to speak in this court. ...Because he doesn't speak English.Klavier:\nYou don't mean...Apollo:\nI do. The defense calls defendant Machi Tobaye to the stand!Judge:\nWh-What!? But he doesn't speak English...Apollo:\nWe'll use an interpreter!Klavier:\nInterpreter? I'm afraid you'll have to look elsewhere. I only speak a few phrases, such as, \"I love you,\" and, \"Where is the toilet?\"Apollo:\nThe defense would like to request Lamiroir as the interpreter.Judge:\nL-Lamiroir!? But there's a possibility she's protecting the defendant...!Apollo:\nBut she'd be interpreting for the defendant! Why would she lie?Judge:\nThis is most unusual...Klavier:\nAh ha ha... Bravo, Herr Forehead. Herr Judge! The prosecution agrees with the defense's request. If Lamiroir lies, I'll be able to tell. Even my limited knowledge of the language should be enough for that.Judge:\nWell, if both prosecution and defense are for this, I see little cause for refusal.Apollo:\n(Finally! Some progress!)Judge:\nBailiff! Please show the defendant and Lamiroir to the witness stand!Klavier:\nI suppose there is a first time for everything. Shall we proceed? Your name, to begin with. ...If you would, Lamiroir.Lamiroir:\nYes... He says, \"Machi Tobaye, the defendant.\"Judge:\nHmm, this is certainly a first for this courtroom. Not that we really needed an interpretation of that message in particular.Apollo:\n(So far, so good...)Judge:\nVery well. Mr. Justice, if you would.Apollo:\nHuh? If I would what, Your Honor?Judge:\n\"Would what\"!? You called the defendant to the stand, did you not? What would you have him testify about!?Apollo:\nWhat do I want him to testify about...? (Ack, I hadn't thought that far yet!)Trucy:\nApollo! Aren't you going to ask him what he was about to tell us yesterday?Apollo:\nHow can I if I don't know what he was saying...?Lamiroir:\nExcuse me, a moment. If I might speak?Judge:\nYes, Lamiroir?Lamiroir:\nJust now, Machi said there is something about which he \"wishes to testify\".Apollo:\n(Machi wants to testify about something? What could it be?)Judge:\nWhat sort of testimony is he talking about?Lamiroir:\n...One moment, please.Apollo:\n(Argh! The suspense is killing me...)Lamiroir:\nWhat...!?Apollo:\n(What? What!?)Judge:\nW-Well, Lamiroir?Lamiroir:\nAccording to Machi... He has \"proof of his innocence\".Judge:\nWh-Wh-Whaaaaaaat!?Klavier:\n...This is a surprise.Trucy:\nYahoo! Victory, Apollo! We did it!Apollo:\n(This is sounding too good to believe. And I know what that usually means...)Judge:\nWell, if that's true, then this is vital testimony! Lamiroir... I mean, Machi! Please testify to the court!Lamiroir:\n\"Very well.\"Witness Testimony-- Proof of Innocence --Lamiroir:\nHe says that word of Mr. LeTouse's death came as a great shock.\nBut if the killing truly followed the lyrics of my song...\n...I, that is, he, could not have done it.\nHe says that because the lyrics are in English, he does not understand them.Judge:\nHmm. I see! He wouldn't have understood the English lyrics to the song. That would prevent him from following them so closely.Klavier:\nI wondered what he meant by \"proof\". Why, he would only have to ask Lamiroir to know the meaning of that song.Apollo:\nLamiroir! Did you ever explain the lyrics of that song to him?Lamiroir:\nI did tell him, generally, what the song was about. But never in so much detail. And he never asked.Klavier:\nHas my oft-repeated warning already fled that forehead? Lamiroir might be protecting the witness!Apollo:\n......Judge:\nWell, anyway, let us proceed with the cross-examination. Mr. Justice, if you would.Apollo:\nYes, Your Honor.

Perhaps I misunderstood!\nKlavier:\nAh, no, not really. Yours is also a valid interpretation.\nApollo:\n(Um... OK?)\nLamiroir:\nNo, it is my fault. I am too used to singing in Borginian.

How does he know the crime followed the lyrics!?\nLamiroir:\n...... Have you always been such a suspicious-minded lad? It is simple. So simple it hardly requires an explanation. ...He read about it in the newspaper.\nApollo:\nThe newspaper!?\nLamiroir:\nThe Borginian Daily Bugle. You can buy it in this country these days, you know. They have already begun to report about this case in our homeland.\nApollo:\n...... (I was right!)\nLamiroir:\nWhat is wrong, Mr. Justice?

I read the full report myself.\nApollo:\nSo, the lyrics weren't in the newspaper and the police didn't mention them.

This was enough to play by. I told him it was a song about a \"guitar in love\".\nKlavier:\nIt's... not actually the guitar that's in love, strictly speaking.\nLamiroir:\nOh? Perhaps I misunderstood!\nKlavier:\nAh, no, not really. Yours is also a valid interpretation.\nApollo:\n(Um... OK?)\nLamiroir:\nNo, it is my fault. I am too used to singing in Borginian. It is much easier than trying to understand these English lyrics.Lamiroir:\nIt was I who explained that the crime followed the song.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nExactly how much did you explain to Machi?\nLamiroir:\n...... Ah, this is a question for me, yes?\nApollo:\n(This interpretation thing is getting old fast...)\nLamiroir:\nI told him that Mr. LeTouse had been killed, and why he was a suspect. And I told him the crimes of that day followed my song.\nApollo:\nDid you mention any particular words of the song relating to the case, such as \"heart\"?\nLamiroir:\nYes, of course I explained this. He was quite surprised.Perceive Lamiroir's swallowing on \"It was I who explained\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Lamiroir...\"Trucy:\nYay! I knew he was innocent!Apollo:\nI believe he is, too, Trucy. I do...Trucy:\nWhat's wrong, Apollo? You got a tummy ache or something?Apollo:\n(Something's hidden in that testimony... If it's the truth, I'll find it!)Apollo:\nLamiroir... I'm currently cross-examining Machi. ...Why should you be uncertain?Lamiroir:\n! Me? Uncertain?Apollo:\nYes, you swallowed the very moment you told the court... ...\"It was I who explained\".Lamiroir:\n...I see there is little point in trying to hide anything from you.Apollo:\nLamiroir, are you, indeed, protecting someone?Lamiroir:\nThat... is not a question with a simple answer.

What I need is another chance. C'mon this is easy: Who is she protecting?)\nLeads back to:\n\"Lamiroir, you're protecting...\"Apollo:\nLamiroir, you are protecting Machi. That's why you lied and told us that you had explained how the crime followed the song!Lamiroir:\n......Apollo:\nI don't fault you for trying to help, but this is not the way!Lamiroir:\n!Apollo:\nMachi! I believe you didn't do it, really! I trust you! But you've lied to us twice. And now you have Lamiroir lying on your behalf!Machi:\n................Apollo:\nIf this is going to work, you have to trust me, too.Machi:\n!Apollo:\nYour two lies cover a simple truth. You understand English. You have to!Machi:\n! ........................ Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaugh!Judge:\nWitness! Is this true? Do you understand English?Machi:\n...Y-Yes. A little, only.Judge:\nWhat!?Klavier:\nFirst he could see, now he can talk. And you... did not know about this, Lamiroir?Lamiroir:\nI... no. I did not! It is quite a surprise.Judge:\nHow many secrets is this witness hiding!?Machi:\nLast... This is... last...Apollo:\nMachi... could you tell us what really happened?Machi:\nNo shooting! I did no shooting!Apollo:\nSo, you weren't in the dressing room when I heard those two gunshots, correct?Machi:\n......Klavier:\nApparently, the answer to that question isn't simple either.Machi:\nI was in... dressing room. Behind desk. Manager, he on floor...Apollo:\n(Which would be after the shooting, right...?)Machi:\n...Then, there is voice...Trucy:\nVoice? Or voices? Was it you and Ema, Apollo?Apollo:\nSo when Machi went into the dressing room, Mr. LeTouse had already been shot. And then we came to the door.Machi:\n...Panel high up. I take off. Run away, run away!Apollo:\nSo it was you who escaped through that air vent!Klavier:\nAh ha ha. As the prosecution has held all along, no less. The defendant has admitted to being at the scene. Might we take this as a confession?Apollo:Apollo:\nNo! He's clearly denied that he did it!Machi:\nI no shooting! Manager on floor. Already on floor...Klavier:Klavier:\nThe victim had already been shot, you say? I find that hard to believe. The defendant understood the song lyrics. He was at the scene of the crime... This can only mean one thing. He is the shooter!Machi:\n!Judge:\nDoes the defendant have anything to say to this?Machi:\n......Trucy:\nHe's clammed up, Apollo!Judge:\nThen let's ask Mr. Justice. Will you require any further testimony from the witness?Apollo:\n(Is that it? Is there nothing else I can get him to testify about? Wait... no, of course there is!)Trucy:\nWhat is this cocoon, anyway?Machi:\n[Foreign text]....Lamiroir:\n\"The cocoon, the silk, is a potent cure.\"Trucy:\nA cure...?Trucy:\nWell, Machi? Are you... a smuggler?Machi:\n[Foreign text]....Lamiroir:\n[Foreign text]!Machi:\n....................Lamiroir:\nHe... won't tell me.Apollo:\n(That cocoon has to have something to do with this!) Machi. Please, tell us the truth, for your own sake.Machi:\n...No. No more speak. Not... to any of you.Klavier:\nSo much for your precious trust, Herr Forehead.Apollo:\n(Hey, you were the one who didn't believe him!)Klavier:\nRegardless, this brings us to an impasse.Judge:\nIt does seem that the defense and defendant are at odds. ...I doubt we are likely to learn anything more of value should this continue. I see no other course but to declare a five-minute recess! The defense will work things out with the defendant so that we might proceed!July 10, 11:23 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2Machi:\n...Apollo Yoostis...Apollo:\n(That's \"Justice\". Better learn how to say it if you ever want to get some.)Machi:\nBelieve. I no shooting.Apollo:\n(Machi claims Mr. LeTouse was already down on the ground when he entered the room.)Trucy:\nMaybe... it was a trap, and he walked right into it?Machi:\nSuddenly. I hear revolver. Close. Very close. Then, I hear voice.Apollo:\nYou heard gunshots?Machi:\nYes. Is true. I hear revolver. But only sound.Apollo:\nWait, you're saying you went into the dressing room... ...and found Mr. LeTouse already dead, and THEN you heard shots? (If that's true...!)Trucy:\nSo... you were at the scene of the crime when you heard those shots?Apollo:\nAnd you escaped through the air vent.Machi:\nI know.Trucy:\nHuh? What do you know?Machi:\nI know if I opening vent... ...I can leave stage and back... backstage.Apollo:\n(So the vents went to both the stage and the backstage area? Is that what he means...?)Trucy:\nHey, he's right! Look, Apollo!Apollo:\nHuh... Yeah. But how did you know it was connected like that?Trucy:\nWait, I bet his father was the architect that designed the hall or something!Machi:\nI hear this. From magician.Apollo:\nMagician...?Trucy:\nD-Don't look at me!Apollo:\n(A magician, huh?)Trucy:\nWell, at least we're clear on one thing: Machi didn't shoot Mr. LeTouse!Apollo:\nYeah, but what does that leave us with? We're supposed to say he went into the room to find the body and then he heard the shots? (That one's going to go over well in court. Not.)Trucy:\nApollo! You're his defense! You're supposed to believe whatever he says. Even lies! That's what Daddy always told me!Apollo:\nUm, I'll just pretend you misheard him. Every time. So... what do we do?Trucy:\nYou're sure you won't testify, Machi?Machi:\nI... no talking. No.Trucy:\nHmm, well it was worth a shot.Apollo:\n(That cocoon...)Machi:\n[Foreign text]....Lamiroir:\n\"I can't go home\"...Trucy:\nCan't go home!?Machi:\n....[Foreign text]....[Foreign text] ....[Foreign text]....Lamiroir:\n\"I can't go home to Borginia. I do not want to go home.\" The penalty for taking a cocoon from Borginia... is death.Apollo:\n(That's right! It's punishable by death!)Apollo:\n(Of course... He's scared.) ...Oh well, I guess we'll just have to try a different approach.Trucy:\nThat's the spirit, Apollo! So, what's your plan?Apollo:\nIf Machi won't testify about it, we'll have to get someone else to testify.Trucy:\nSomeone... else?Apollo:\n...I think we're out of time. Let's get back in there.Trucy:\nRight!July 10, 11:28 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:\n...Court is now back in session. Mr. Justice. Have you sorted things out with the defendant?Apollo:\nYes, Your Honor. We had a good talk.Judge:\nHmm, very well. So will he testify?Apollo:\nYour Honor, the defendant... will not testify.Judge:\nWh-What!?Klavier:\n...... Shame. And here I thought this was your big chance to turn the case around.Apollo:\nActually, it is. ...The defense would like to approach this case from a different angle, Your Honor!Judge:\nA different... angle?Apollo:\n(If Machi won't testify... ...then I know who will!) I would like to cross-examine the witness in this case... Lamiroir!Judge:\nL-Lamiroir...?Klavier:Klavier:\nWhat are you up to now? I thought we determined yesterday that Lamiroir's testimony was insubstantial! There's nothing you can--Apollo:\n...Lamiroir was taken to the hospital yesterday with injuries.Judge:\nWhat happened?Apollo:\nShe was assaulted, Your Honor.Judge:\nAssaulted!?Apollo:\nSomeone wanted Lamiroir dead. Thankfully, she was able to save herself...Klavier:\nWhat!? I've heard no such report!Apollo:\nProsecutor Gavin...Klavier:\n!Apollo:\nWhy would anyone be out to kill Lamiroir? Can you think of a reason?Klavier:\nW-Well...Apollo:\nThink of how she is known in our country... A singer, from overseas, who doesn't speak English, yes? Yet someone tried to keep her mouth shut! Who could that have been?Judge:\nYou don't think...Apollo:\nI do! It was the same person who shot Mr. LeTouse! The killer was afraid of her, afraid of what she might say! The defense believes that something was hidden in her testimony yesterday. Something that the killer doesn't want getting out!Klavier:\nSo, am I to understand that this is what you are saying? Namely, that there is a nugget of \"truth\" in Lamiroir's testimony... ...A nugget we have yet to uncover?Apollo:\n...Exactly.Judge:\nHmm... If Lamiroir was attacked, this has serious implications! Very well... There were some vague points in her testimony during yesterday's trial. Perhaps we did not inquire as deeply as we might have into some. The court will hear Lamiroir's testimony once more!Klavier:\n...Lamiroir, I must apologize. We must ask you to stand again and speak.Lamiroir:\nYou need not apologize. I know that Machi is innocent. And I will do all that I can until the court realizes this.Apollo:\nLet's review your testimony from yesterday. You told us you heard two gunshots and the shooter's voice through the window. ...And that the voice belonged to Daryan Crescend, yes?Lamiroir:\n...That is correct.Klavier:\nAt which point I proved she could not be correct. She couldn't have heard any of those things. The small window at the scene was closed, and was found to be quite soundproof.Apollo:\n......Judge:\n...You have nothing to say to that, Mr. Justice?Apollo:\nI don't know exactly what, yet, but I do know there's something there!Klavier:\nThere is, it seems, much you do not know.Judge:\nAnd yet it is my duty to hear him out. Perhaps the witness would be so kind as to testify once more to the court?Lamiroir:\n...Of course, Your Honor.Witness Testimony-- What I Heard --Lamiroir:\nI was on my way from the stage to the backstage exit.\nThat's when I heard them: Mr. LeTouse and the detective.\nI heard the faint sound of a gunshot and stopped. Then I heard another gunshot.\nThere was the smell of gunpowder... I knew I must tell someone, but...\nI was in a hurry, so I kept moving past the small window.Judge:\nHmm... Pretty much the same as yesterday's testimony.Lamiroir:\nI am sorry. I am not used to speaking much in this language. Perhaps my descriptions are lacking in some way. Yet, everything I have said here is the truth.Klavier:\nThen it is my distinct displeasure to say this. What you have said to have happened... is impossible.Apollo:\nDo I have to repeat myself? Lamiroir was attacked because of this testimony!Klavier:\n...!Trucy:\n......Apollo:\nWh-What? Trucy?Trucy:\nApollo... You know, for a moment there... ...You were pretty cool.Apollo:\n(...Maybe I do better when I don't try to think ahead.)Judge:\nVery well, Mr. Justice. Perhaps you can \"coolly\" cross-examine the witness?Cross Examination",

Please continue with your testimony.\nJudge:\nHmm. Now I know what they mean about the reckless youth these days.\nKlavier:\nThe one in red over there is a shining example, Herr Judge.\nApollo:\n(You're the last person who should be pointing fingers, Mr. Rock Star...)Lamiroir:\nThat's when I heard them: Mr. LeTouse and the detective.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nDaryan Crescend...?\nLamiroir:\nI did not know his name at the time. But yes, it was him, the one who took the stand yesterday.\nKlavier:\nHow many times do I need to remind you that's impossible? There is no way you could have heard him.\nApollo:\nBecause the window at the scene was closed? Is that why?\nKlavier:\nOf course.\nTrucy:\nApollo! If we keep asking the same questions as yesterday we won't get anywhere!\nApollo:\n(She's right. Maybe there's a different angle I can try?)\n\n\n\nWhat were they talking about?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nLamiroir, do you by any chance remember what they were saying to each other? If so, please tell us!\nKlavier:\n......\nLamiroir:\nI have given it much reflection, but...\nApollo:\n(I was afraid of this. She doesn't remember...)\nLamiroir:\n...I only heard one phrase clearly.\nApollo:\nA whole phrase!?\nKlavier:\nYou remember something that was said!?\nApollo:\nWhy didn't you say anything yesterday!?\nLamiroir:\nThough my memory is clear, I was afraid to speak. You see, I do not understand what was said.\nApollo:\n(This could be it! The clue I've been waiting for!) W-Well what did he say!?\nLamiroir:\nIt was the other man speaking, not Mr. LeTouse.\nApollo:\nThe shooter, then. (Daryan Crescend...)\nJudge:\nWell, what did he say!?\nLamiroir:\n...... \"It's over. Press the switch! Now!\"\nJudge:\n\"Switch\"...? And the shooter said this to the victim, Mr. LeTouse?\nLamiroir:\nI thought it quite strange myself, afterward.\nJudge:\nHmm. It is a mystery. What could it possibly mean? Mr. Justice? Care to shed some light on this?\nApollo:\nUrk. Um, I mean, sure...! I-I'd be delighted... It's, um, very, very vital! Maybe we could add that to the testimony!\nTrucy:\n\"Maybe\", Apollo?\nAdds statement \"From the small window, I heard a voice say, \"Press the switch! Now!\"\"\n\n\n\n\nDid you hear anything else?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nDid you happen to hear anything else at that time?\nLamiroir:\nAnything else...?\nApollo:\nAnything else besides the victim and the shooter's conversation. Anything at all.\nKlavier:\nThat's quite the vague question.\nLamiroir:\n...... Other than the conversation? I heard a clock ticking, the two men breathing, footsteps. ...That is all.\nKlavier:\nNothing new there, as expected.\nApollo:\n(Ack! I was hoping for a little more than that!)\nJudge:\nPerhaps we should just carry on with the cross-examination.\nLamiroir:\nAs you wish.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nNo need\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n(On second thought, maybe I'll just play it safe here. See, I can be calm and collected, too, sometimes!)\nTrucy:\nDon't get too calm, or you might grind to a halt.\nApollo:\nThanks for the vote of confidence.\nTrucy:\nI liked you better before with the \"do I have to repeat myself\" bit.\nApollo:\n(Argh, so which should I be? ...Maybe I am overthinking this whole thing.)\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after adding statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nSo, you remember a part of their conversation.\nLamiroir:\nYes, the conversation between Mr. LeTouse and the detective. I remember it quite clearly.Lamiroir:\nFrom the small window, I heard a voice say, \"Press the switch! Now!\"Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nAnd it was Detective Daryan Crescend's voice?\nLamiroir:\nYes, I am sure of it.\nJudge:\n\"It's over. Press the switch.\" Why would he say that to Mr. LeTouse?\nTrucy:\nApollo! The murder weapon, the revolver was Mr. LeTouse's, right?\nApollo:\nYeah... what of it?\nTrucy:\nWell, maybe when he said, \"Press the switch\"... ...he really meant to say, \"Pull the trigger!\" Because his English isn't so good!\nApollo:\n...... Daryan Crescend is a native speaker!\nTrucy:\nOh. Oh, right! Sorry, I kind of forgot who was what.\nApollo:\n(\"Press the switch\"... That's not something a killer usually says to his or her victim, is it.)\nJudge:\nWas there no one else in the room?\nLamiroir:\n...I do not know. All I heard was Mr. LeTouse and the detective.Present Remote Trigger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...\"Press the switch.\"\"Lamiroir:\nI heard the faint sound of a gunshot and stopped. Then I heard another gunshot.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nThere were two gunshots...\nLamiroir:\nYes, I heard two. One after the other.\nApollo:\n(That fits with the bullet holes at the scene. Nothing really new here to pick up...)Lamiroir:\nThere was the smell of gunpowder... I knew I must tell someone, but...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nWhy didn't you tell someone immediately?\nLamiroir:\nW-Well I...\nJudge:\nIf it were me, I would have gone to the police right away. It's our duty as citizens!\nKlavier:\nThis may be beside the point, but Lamiroir isn't a citizen. Though one would hope such common sense prevails in Borginia as well...?\nLamiroir:\n......\nTrucy:\nLamiroir seems awfully quiet all of a sudden.\nApollo:\n(That's strange... Could she be hiding something?)\nLamiroir:\nIt is as you say, yet, at the time...Lamiroir:\nI was in a hurry, so I kept moving past the small window.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nYou were in a hurry... to go where?\nLamiroir:\n...I was on my way to the backstage exit, as I have said.\nApollo:\nWhy were you in such a hurry then?\nLamiroir:\nW-Well... I don't think that has anything to do with this case.\nApollo:\nIt very well might! Please answer the question!\nKlavier:\n\nKlavier:\nAre you alright, Lamiroir?\nLamiroir:\nYes... Yes. I am just tired.\nKlavier:\nRecall what I told you yesterday, Herr Forehead. Lamiroir suffers from serious amnesia. Please refrain from traumatizing her further.\nApollo:\n(Grr... What, so he can just dismiss questions he thinks are \"too traumatizing\"!?)\nKlavier:\nWhy don't you prove her reason had a connection to the case before asking about it, ja?\nJudge:\nThe prosecution's objection is sustained. The current question is moot. Mr. Justice, please continue with your cross-examination.Apollo:\n(Lamiroir was attacked because of this testimony. I know she was... So something's got to be hidden here!)Trucy:\nMaybe there's some detail we're missing?Apollo:\nI guess we'll just have to get her to fill in the blanks.Trucy:\nRight!Apollo:\n...\"Press the switch.\" There's only one key that can unlock the mystery of those words!Klavier:\nOh? Yet there was nothing at the scene that could be called a \"switch\". Save the lights'. [sic]Apollo:\nTrue, there wasn't a switch at the scene. But, it just so happens... I have a \"switch\" right here.Judge:\nThat certainly does look like a switch, doesn't it.Apollo:\nThe problem is... ...this was found not at the scene of the crime, but on the stage.Judge:\nThe stage...?Apollo:\nWhere the concert was held, yes. This was found hidden there!Klavier:\nOn the stage...Judge:\nAre you claiming that the voice Lamiroir heard... ...was of someone commanding another to press this switch?Apollo:\n...It's a possibility.Klavier:Klavier:\nOh, Herr Forehead? I'd call that an \"impossibility\".Apollo:\n...Why?Klavier:\nIt's hardly necessary for me to remind the court of the layout of the concert forum. The stage is quite far from Lamiroir's dressing room. Not to mention that the Gavinners were in the middle of a concert on said stage. We aren't known for being a quiet band. You could shout all you wanted and not be heard.Lamiroir:\nThe detective's voice was loud... but certainly not a shout.Klavier:\nSo, too, have Herr Forehead's cries of \"possibility\" fallen far short of being heard...Apollo:\n...Sorry, but he wouldn't have needed to shout.Klavier:\n...Excuse me?Apollo:\nYou heard what I said. Or... do you need me to shout it out for you? It would have been quite simple to be heard on the stage from that dressing room. Oh, wait, you like evidence don't you? How about this! Using this, it would be easy to get a message to someone on stage from the dressing room.Present Headset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Prosecutor Gavin. Perhaps you're familiar with this?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nJudge:\nHmm. So the shooter used this to erm, get his message to the stage? Perhaps you could demonstrate how this was done for us?\nApollo:\n...... (Um... Maybe I was wrong?) ...Sorry, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nWhat? I can't hear you!\nApollo:\n(Ha ha, very funny...)\nKlavier:\nApparently, it is easier said than done.\nApollo:\nYour Honor! If I might show another piece of evidence!!!\nJudge:\nNo need to shout, Mr. Justice. Go ahead, show your evidence.\nApollo:\nNeither did the shooter need to shout, Your Honor. Not with this...!\nLeads back to:\n\"Using this, it would be easy to get a message to someone on stage from the dressing room.\"Apollo:\nProsecutor Gavin. Perhaps you're familiar with this?Klavier:\n! Wh-Why that's...Judge:\nWhat? What is it!? Is that some kind of new-fangled phone they invented while I wasn't looking!?Apollo:\nThis is a type of transmitter. A communications device.Judge:\nCommunications? Device?Apollo:\nFrom what I've heard, that night... ...everyone on stage was wearing one of these. Isn't that right, Prosecutor Gavin?Klavier:\nAh, yes, actually. They're for talking between band members. We all had one on.Apollo:\nSo you admit that if you were wearing one of these... ...talking from the backstage to the stage would be simple!Klavier:Klavier:\nTrue, but wait! Those send out an electronic signal. To avoid interference with the audio systems, their range is quite limited.Trucy:\nLamiroir said it was about thirty feet, right?Apollo:\nLook at this cross-section diagram of the concert forum.Klavier:\nAh...Apollo:\nExactly. The walk from the stage to the backstage seems far. But the direct distance is less than thirty feet!Klavier:\nThat... can't be...Judge:\nSo, when Lamiroir heard the shooter's voice... ...he could have been talking to someone on stage!Klavier:Klavier:\nHah! You're claiming this is the \"switch\" in question? Why did it have to be on the stage at the time? It could be placed in a pocket and carried anywhere! Someone could have hid it on the stage after the fact!Trucy:\nHey... he's got a point! How do we know where it was when she heard the voice? ...When the shooter said \"press the switch\"?Apollo:\nWell, I guess we don't...Judge:\nHmm... An unfortunate situation. I'm afraid that until we know where this switch was, there's little point in debating it.Apollo:\nUgh... (I was sure this was the way to go with this...!)Klavier:\nWhat is this switch, anyway? We don't even know that basic fact.Apollo:\n...... (Wait a second... I do know what this \"switch\" is! And if you follow that train of logic to its incredible conclusion... ...it ends up in proof that completely changes this case!)Trucy:\nWhat's up, Apollo? Apollo...?Apollo:\nWe know about this \"switch\", right? We know what it is.Trucy:\nY...Yeah?Apollo:\nWell... think of when it was used that day... Think of what happened!Judge:\nWell, Mr. Justice? If you have no further information to share concerning this switch...Apollo:\n...Your Honor!Judge:\nYes, Mr. Justice?Apollo:\nI've been remiss in not telling the court this before. I know what this \"switch\" is.Judge:\nHmm... Well, it seems the defense is set upon linking this switch to the case. Let's see your evidence of the link! What evidence do you have to explain what this \"switch\" is?Present Igniter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Prosecutor Gavin, you remember this?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nJudge:\n......\nApollo:\n(...Huh?)\nKlavier:\nI fail to see how this evidence links the \"switch\" to this case in any way.\nJudge:\nMr. Justice... Might I recommend a \"switch\" of evidence?\nApollo:\n(Ugh... I knew it.)\nJudge:\nOnce again, please!\nLeads back to:\n\"What evidence do you have to explain what this \"switch\" is?\"Apollo:\nProsecutor Gavin, you remember this?Klavier:\nAch! That's that...Judge:\nThat what!? Is it another one of those new-fangled phones!?Apollo:\nThis... is an igniter. (What phone looks like this!?)Judge:\nI-I-Igniter? You mean it's like a lighter?Apollo:\nYes, actually.Klavier:\nYou aren't saying this switch is a remote...?Apollo:\nI am. This is a remote trigger for an igniter.Klavier:\nWhat...?Apollo:\nLook, I'll show you.Judge:\n.................. Yow yow yow yow yow! Mr. Justice! You will cease and desist from burning down this courtroom!Apollo:\nEr, sorry. That was a bit more fire than I'd expected.Judge:\nIf my whiskers had caught on fire...Apollo:\n...Prosecutor Gavin. Let me repeat myself. This switch is a remote igniter trigger.Klavier:\n......Apollo:\nDoesn't that suggest something to you?Klavier:\nYou're... talking about what happened to me, aren't you?Trucy:\nAh...!Apollo:\nExactly. That night at the concert there was one unusual burst of flame. ...When your guitar caught fire in the middle of the performance!Judge:\nWasn't that part of the stage show, though?Apollo:\nProsecutor Gavin was entirely unaware such a thing had been planned. And the guitar that burned was a valuable keepsake.Trucy:\nThat's right... He got it in Borginia from Lamiroir! He said the sound was amazing. Before it burned, of course. Now it just kind of smokes.Klavier:\nThe better the guitar, the brighter it burns. Herr Forehead!Apollo:\nYes?Klavier:\nDon't tell me you're trying to tie these two things together? Those being the shooter's voice, heard by Lamiroir... ...and the guitar suddenly catching on fire?Apollo:\nI am. It's really simple when you think about it. Mr. LeTouse and the shooter were at the crime scene. The shooter was wearing a headset. He ordered someone on stage to \"press the switch\". The switch was pressed, and the guitar caught fire.Judge:\nWell, that does seem to make sense... Though something about it is bugging me. Can't quite put my finger on it...Apollo:\nReally? It seems pretty simple to me.Klavier:Klavier:\nHerr Forehead, don't destroy what little respect I have for you!Apollo:\n......Klavier:\nI was expecting something a little more... sensible. I guess I was wrong.Judge:\nWhat's this all about, Prosecutor Gavin?Klavier:\nHis simple story simply makes no sense. Think! That night, my guitar caught fire, yes. The cause... may have been this, indeed. However! The guitar caught fire during the second set!Trucy:\nAck! That's right! Of course! The guitar caught fire during Lamiroir's song!Klavier:\nIndeed. Yet the shooting happened during the third set. The two are utterly unrelated!Judge:\nHmm, yes, that must have been what was bugging me. The whole premise for this is faulty!Klavier:\nSee? His story makes no sense.Apollo:Apollo:\nAre you sure about that?Judge:\n...! What exactly do you mean, Mr. Justice?Apollo:\nMaybe it's not the premise for my explanation of the switch that's at fault... ...Maybe it's our premise for the entire case so far!Judge:\nWhat premise is this, specifically?Apollo:\nI'm glad you asked. I'm saying that maybe the killing didn't take place in the third act!Klavier:Klavier:\nWhat's this? But Detective Ema Skye heard shots and found the body. All of this happened in the third act!Apollo:Apollo:\nGunshots rang out... And, according to his testimony, Machi was in that dressing room at the time.Judge:\nWhere are you going with this, Mr. Justice?Apollo:\nStay with me, Your Honor! He also told us this in his testimony: Namely, that the victim had already been shot! We all heard gunshots... but no one saw the shooting!Klavier:\nThis... This is insane!Apollo:\nJust before the \"shooting\" took place, the \"shooter\" was heard on his headset... ...telling someone to \"press the switch\"! The next moment, Prosecutor Gavin's guitar burst into flame. We know that a remote triggered igniter was inside the guitar. From all these facts, we can draw only one conclusion! The crime did not take place during the third act... ...but during the ballad performance... The second act!Klavier:\nWhaaat!?Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! B-But that goes against the evidence!Apollo:\n...What does, Your Honor?Judge:\nThis crime was carried out according to the lyrics of that song, yes?Trucy:\nHey, he's right! Look! The \"bullet\" is supposed to come after the \"fire\"!Apollo:\nYou're thinking about it the wrong way.Trucy:\nHuh?Apollo:\nLook... Why would the shooter craft the events of the day to follow the lyrics anyway? It's an awful lot of trouble to go through. ...With little merit for the person doing it.Judge:\nWell, I'm sure whoever it was had some reason...Apollo:\nYes, they did. A reason that made it advantageous to follow the lyrics.Klavier:\n...You're saying the order was reversed on purpose!Judge:\nHmm? Reversed, Prosecutor Gavin?Klavier:\nIf the criminal followed the lyrics strictly, then yes... ...the shooting would have had to come after the guitar burst into flame. Yet, Herr Forehead has raised another possibility. He's claiming that the bullet came not after, but just before the \"fire\".Apollo:\n...Couldn't have put it better myself. We were only meant to think that the shooting came after the guitar burst into flame! That was the criminal's objective! The crime followed the lyrics to a point, but that was the ruse! Why else would the killer risk discovery by moving the body? That was the final touch to make us think he'd followed the lyrics the whole way!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! That would explain this most unusual situation...Apollo:\nIt does! The killer changed the order of events to create himself an alibi! In other words... The killer was someone who had an alibi for the third set, but not the second!Klavier:Klavier:\nI was hoping it wouldn't come to this. But sadly, it has. Let me tell you why your little fairy tale makes no sense at all.Apollo:\n......Klavier:\nOh, it sounds good, I'll give you that. You've given us a reason why the killer bothered following the lyrics of my song. But I question your logic! ...For it's flawed from the very beginning.Apollo:\nFlawed?Klavier:\nYes. A contradiction, Herr Forehead, one I've pointed out several times, no less. At the time of the crime, the small window at the scene was closed... How could Lamiroir have heard a voice through it?Apollo:\nOh...Klavier:\nI know that you would like to divert our attention from this critical fact. But you're basing your entire line of reasoning on a false premise!Apollo:\n...... (Right... Lamiroir's testimony is my entire case... ...That voice she heard... The shooter's voice...)Trucy:\nW-What if she couldn't hear it, Apollo?Apollo:\nLook, what do we have. A man saying \"press the switch!\" And near the crime scene, we have a switch. Which acts as a remote trigger for an igniter. And last, but not least, Prosecutor Gavin's flaming guitar. (It can't all be coincidence! But how do I make it work?)Klavier:\nI see a more direct line of questioning is required. When the crime scene was investigated, immediately after the crime... ...that window was closed! Care to tell us how Lamiroir heard the voice?Judge:\nHmm... A key point, to be sure. ...Mr. Justice! Can you explain this to the court?Apollo:\n(OK Justice, you've got one thing to prove, and one thing only. Lamiroir heard a \"voice\"... ...and she heard it during the second set! Think! How was Lamiroir able to hear the voice?)The window was open.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nObviously, the window was open... It had to be for her to hear the voice!\nKlavier:\n\nKlavier:\nNews bulletin, Herr Forehead: That horse is dead. Stop beating it, for all our sakes. That window was closed! This is a hard fact, reported by the investigation team.\nApollo:\nB-But...\nKlavier:\nOh? You have evidence to the contrary, perhaps?\nApollo:\nWell, no, but...\nKlavier:\nThen do be quiet. I tire of this charade.\nApollo:\n(Grr... Time to rethink this!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Lamiroir heard a \"voice\"...\"She has divine hearing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nThe window was closed, as you say, yet Lamiroir could still hear the voice... ...because she has the power of divine hearing! That's the only explanation!\nLamiroir:\n......\nKlavier:\n......\nJudge:\n...The witness is a Siren, Mr. Justice. Not a Saint.\nApollo:\nUm, I said \"hearing\", Your Honor, not \"healing\". (Well that fell on deaf ears.)\nLamiroir:\nI'm not sure I know what this \"divine hearing\" ability is...\nKlavier:\nThen perhaps we should hear it straight from the All-Powerful Voice himself. Care to explain how clairaudience has anything to do with this case?\nApollo:\nUh... Erm... Can we just move on now?\nJudge:\nOnly if you can enlighten this court!\nApollo:\n(Time to rethink this...!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Lamiroir heard a \"voice\"...\"She was somewhere else.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"When we investigated the scene, the window was closed.\"Apollo:\nWhen we investigated the scene, the window was closed. The shooter had no reason to close it, had it been open, either. Meaning, it was impossible to hear the voice through that window.Klavier:\nAh, it's good to hear you making sense again. For a moment, I was afraid you might be a Borginian, too.Apollo:\n...As I was saying, Lamiroir could not hear the voice through that window. So there can be only one explanation. She heard the voice from another location entirely!Judge:\nWh-What's this...?Klavier:\nHa ha ha, you do amuse me so. And here I thought you and good sense were back on speaking terms. Now, I'm afraid you and good sense speak two entirely different languages.Apollo:\n......Klavier:\nShall I interpret for you, Herr Forehead? Lamiroir clearly stated she heard the voice through that small window! And there is only one \"small window\" at the scene!Apollo:\n...Are you sure?Klavier:\n!Apollo:\nThink about it... Isn't there another \"small window\" at the scene?Trucy:\nTh-There is!?Judge:\nAh, I know that look. He wants us to ask him. Very well. You claim Lamiroir heard the voice from another location? Mr. Justice, show us where this location was!Apollo:\nLamiroir heard the voice from... here!Present air vent above ladder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"...This is where Lamiroir heard that voice from.\"Present small window\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nThere! That's a small window!\nKlavier:\nAnd this changes what?\nApollo:\n(Not much, I know...) ...Erm, I couldn't find anything better, so...\nJudge:\nThe court applauds your honesty. And weeps for your case, Mr. Justice.\nApollo:\n(You're not the only one crying here...)\nTrucy:\nApollo! Think it through again!\nApollo:\nI know... I'm trying... (Lamiroir claims she heard the voice through a \"small window\". ...And if the small window we know about was closed... ...there's only one other thing she could have meant!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Lamiroir heard the voice from... here!\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nJudge:\n...... Does this look like a small window to you, Mr. Justice?\nApollo:\n...The state of modern society can be read from numerous objects and artifacts. In a sense, anything can be a \"window\" on our society.\nJudge:\nI didn't ask you to point out a window on society. I want a window on the crime scene!\nApollo:\n(No points for trying...? Lamiroir claims she heard the voice through a \"small window\". ...And if the small window we know about was closed... ...there's only one other thing she could have meant!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Lamiroir heard the voice from... here!\"Apollo:\n...This is where Lamiroir heard that voice from.Judge:\nB-But that's no \"small window\"! That's the air vent!Apollo:\nWhat did she tell us? She said she's a Borginian, unfamiliar with our language! It's not a stretch to imagine she called this \"air vent\" a \"small window\"!Klavier:Klavier:\nNow you've done it. You've gone beyond ridiculous and into... ludicrous. So Lamiroir was up in the ventilation system listening to this man's voice?Apollo:\nThat's the only logical explanation, yes.Klavier:\n\"Logical\"? I do not think this word means what you think it means, Herr Forehead!Apollo:\nOK, what about it isn't logical?Klavier:\nHah! It hardly merits saying! Why would Lamiroir be in the ventilation system? Hiding like a rat! No offense intended to her, of course.Apollo:\nThe explanation for that is simple, Prosecutor Gavin. Isn't it... Lamiroir?Lamiroir:\n...!Apollo:\nYou have been listening to our discussion here, yes?Lamiroir:\n...Yes. I admit, it's had me quite confused since yesterday. Yes, the small window was closed... ...but why should that mean I could not hear through it? I feared our prosecutor might himself need an interpreter...Klavier:\nUrk...Apollo:\nThe problem here is words. Lamiroir, this \"small window\" through which you heard the voice... Was it up high, on the ceiling of the room? Not low on a wall?Lamiroir:\n...Yes, it was up on the ceiling.Klavier:\nWhaaaat!?Judge:\nOrder! Order! I will have order!!!Judge:\n...Witness! You will clarify this statement to the court! Are you, in fact, saying that you were up above the ceiling of the room? And that's where you heard the moment of the crime?Lamiroir:\nYes, in fact, I was. I am sorry. I never imagined it would become such an important point...Apollo:\nYes, well... why the heck were you up there!?Lamiroir:\n......Judge:\nI believe it's time for another testimony.Lamiroir:\nI... I'm not sure I... I can't.Judge:\nMay I remind you this is a murder trial? We will hear your testimony! Tell us why you \"witnessed\" the crime from above the ceiling of that room! ...Please.Lamiroir:\n......Apollo:\n(Well... Looks like I'm on the right track...)Witness Testimony-- Above the Ceiling --Lamiroir:\nYes, I was above the ceiling when I heard the voice.\nI had heard there was a, er, \"small window\" there before.\nIt was in the middle of my performance... I had no time to report what I had heard.\nAs to why I was there... I cannot say.\nI am bound to secrecy on this matter.Judge:\nB-Bound to secrecy!?Lamiroir:\nIn my line of work, one has many obligations to uphold.Judge:\nBut you say you were in the middle of your performance! So this did happen during the second set!Lamiroir:\n...I did not witness the crime, you must understand. I only know what I heard.Judge:\nYes, but you must tell us what you were doing, in detail!Klavier:\nThat's what the cross-examination is for, ja, Herr Forehead?Apollo:\n...!Klavier:\nOur mission in this court is to discern the truth. No obligation, no binding pact, may hinder that mission.Judge:\nHmm... Very well. Mr. Justice, you may begin the cross-examination.Trucy:\nWh-What are you going to do, Apollo!?Apollo:\n...I'm going to find out the truth. (...She was up above that ceiling for a reason. I just have to get it out of her.)Cross Examination",

What's done is done! The mind works differently when one is in the middle of a performance. Why, I've lost my voice in the middle of a show and kept on singing, completely unaware.\nApollo:\n(Singing without a voice? ...If only all contradictions were so obvious. ...If only I could get Lamiroir to talk.

What do we do?\nApollo:\nWe'll just have to prove it ourselves. ...As long as she is bound by this pact of silence, she won't talk. But if I can prove why she was up there, she'll have to admit it.\nTrucy:\nBut how are you going to do that!? She was singing on the stage, Apollo!

I think I know why she was up there... but how do I prove it?)Apollo:\nLamiroir, truth be told, the reason for your presence above that ceiling is quite clear. Especially when you consider what happened during your performance.Lamiroir:\nWhat \"happened\"...?Apollo:\nYes. It's all right here on this video.It wraps itself around me,And now through the air I fly.\nWoh... Woh...\nBurning on in my heart. Fire.Burn my love away. All away.\nLike a bullet of love. Fire.Take my life away. All away.\n\nGuitar, Guitar...Up together to the sky.Lamiroir:\n......Apollo:\nAs we can see, Lamiroir was clearly not on stage for her entire performance!Judge:\nAh...Apollo:\nThough it saddens me to be so realistic... Lamiroir is incapable of actually vanishing, let alone teleportation. So, the only explanation is that she was hidden from view. And during that time, she moved to the back of the forum.Trucy:\nApollo!Apollo:\nWh-What, Trucy?Trucy:\nIt's not nice to reveal a magician's secrets! And it's against the rules!Apollo:\nBut I'm a lawyer! I'm not supposed to be nice!Judge:\nThis... is all very fascinating. But how is it possible? There is only twenty seconds between when she disappears and reappears! She couldn't have moved that fast!Klavier:\n......Judge:\nIs... something wrong, Prosecutor Gavin?Apollo:\n...This was his concert, his show. He knows how the illusion was performed.Judge:\nAh ha!Apollo:\nHe's just realizing his own oversight. Let's look at the cross-section diagram again. Here, we can trace a route through the ceiling... It goes from the stage, through the backstage to the rear of the forum.Judge:\nAh... Aaaaah!Apollo:\nRecall Lamiroir's testimony from yesterday...Lamiroir:\nI was on my way from the stage to the backstage exit. There was something like a little window there... That's how I saw it.Judge:\nShe went from the stage to the backstage exit... ...a perfect description of this route above the ceiling!Apollo:\nLamiroir knew of this because of her part in the illusion. But she wasn't the only one who knew.Klavier:\nWhat...?Apollo:\nJust now in the lobby, Machi told me something:Machi:\nI know. I know if I opening vent...  ...I can leave stage and back... backstage.Klavier:\nHe said that!?Apollo:\nOh, were you not informed, Prosecutor Gavin?Klavier:\n............ I... I knew about the vanishing act, of course. Yet, I had no idea of the route that would be used. Why didn't that magician tell me!Trucy:\nMagicians only reveal details of their acts on a need-to-know basis. They're the bread and butter of a magician's life, you know.Apollo:\n(Which is why he bound Lamiroir to secrecy...) ...Well, Lamiroir?Lamiroir:\n...I am impressed, Mr. Attorney. Machi was right about you.Judge:\nSo... what does this mean? Are you saying you used this route above the ceiling?Lamiroir:\n...I did.Judge:\nWell, that's that... but I'm still a little confused.Apollo:\nWhy's that, Your Honor?Judge:\nAs I said before... There was very little time between when she disappeared and when she reappeared. Twenty seconds, tops! How could she do it so fast? Especially if she stopped to hear the shooter's voice!Apollo:\nThat... That's a good question.Judge:\nCan the witness explain this to the court?Lamiroir:\nI... cannot.Judge:\n...Very well. Mr. Justice?Apollo:\nYes?Judge:\nIt's all up to you. Do your thing.Apollo:\nUm, what thing, Your Honor?Judge:\nYou need to explain how Lamiroir was able to teleport like she did. Or I'm throwing your case out with the bathwater.Apollo:\nUgh... (Why do I get picked on? It's Lamiroir who isn't going along with the program here!)Lamiroir:\nAs I have stated before... I am not at liberty to speak of the illusion that night in detail.Judge:\nThen, you'll just have to tell us what you can. We'll hear your testimony on this. Mr. Justice, it will be your job to wring the truth out of her.Lamiroir:\nYes, if you would, please.Apollo:\n...Right.

Two minutes, you say? The mystery deepens!Apollo:\n(I suppose it was too much to hope that the judge would come up with something...)Judge:\nAs does my curiosity!

P-Prosecutor Gavin!\nKlavier:\n...From your expression, I gather you had no idea this was the case, Herr Judge. I, of course, knew about it.\nJudge:\nWh-What?\nKlavier:\nDon't get me wrong, I wasn't hiding it. It just never occurred to me... ...that the switch and the shooting took place at the same time.\nApollo:\nSo... I was right? There was a switch?\nKlavier:\nThere was. Just before the stage's tower rose, Lamiroir was \"replaced\".\nJudge:\nWhile we're on the subject, just who was this replacement Lamiroir...?\nKlavier:\nWhy, the man behind the illusion. Valant Gramarye.\nApollo:\n(It was Gramarye...!?) That's... quite the illusion. But I still don't get one thing...\nLamiroir:\nYes?\nApollo:\n...The switch happened before the tower rose, correct? So you weren't on the stage!\nLamiroir:\nThat's right.\nApollo:\nBut this, er, fake Lamiroir is still singing! And she's pretty good!\nJudge:\nThat's true!\nTrucy:\nC'mon, Apollo! That's an easy one. They were just playing a recording!\nKlavier:\nAh ha ha... The Gavinners aren't some kind of air guitar band, Fräulein.\nTrucy:\nOh? You mean, I'm wrong?\nKlavier:\nWhen we play a show live, we play live. No recordings. ...Perhaps you can explain, Lamiroir?\nLamiroir:\nVery well...\nJudge:\nYes, do tell! And add it to your testimony.\nChanges statement from \"I was on my way, when I heard the voice.\" to \"I... had to keep singing, even while I moved.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nJudge:\nAh ha! So this is it? The magical key to unlocking this illusion's dark secret!? Tell us how it works! Quickly! I can't bear the suspense!\nApollo:\n(...I was kind of hoping someone else would jump in at this point.) W-Well, you see...\nKlavier:\n\nKlavier:\nHerr Judge, I do hate to spoil the mood... ...but I haven't the faintest idea what he's talking about. And neither does he.\nTrucy:\nI'm a little confused, too, there, Apollo.\nApollo:\n...Right! By which I conclude that... I was wrong.\nTrucy:\nBetter luck next time, Polly-wog!\nJudge:\n...Mr. Justice. I'm holding you responsible for spoiling my mood!\nApollo:\n(Was that a tear I just saw in the judge's eye? ...Alright, nothing to do but rethink this through. The key's in the video somewhere. I'm sure of it!)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's no evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n(What kind of evidence could prove that...?) Um, what's your professional opinion about this one, Trucy?\nTrucy:\nSorry. I don't work in evidence.\nApollo:\nAnd I don't work in tricks! I'm an attorney, not a magician for crying out loud!\nTrucy:\nReally? I'm sure Daddy would have loved working on this.\nApollo:\nThanks, that makes me feel oh so much better.\nJudge:\nWell, I don't know about all of you, but I find this mystery fascinating! And I'm not letting this trial go any further until we get to the bottom of it! The defense will continue with the cross-examination until we have some answers!\nApollo:\n(Easier said than done...)\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after changing fifth statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nAll made possible by the switching trick.\nLamiroir:\nIt was quite a surprise to me at first. To think, a man, posing as me!\nKlavier:\nAn enchantment woven with music and magic... Perfection!\nLamiroir:\nYes, above all else, I was careful that the music did not stop.Lamiroir:\nI was on my way, when I heard the voice.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nAnd it was Daryan's voice you heard?\nLamiroir:\nYes, I am certain it was him.\nKlavier:\n\nKlavier:\nA matter best left for later, ja? Put that forehead of yours to work on this illusion first.\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nHold on! I think the identity of the killer is a little more important, don't you?\nJudge:\nImportance shmortance! Objection overruled! Tell us about the illusion!\nTrucy:\nNo use trying to avoid the problem at hand, Apollo.\nApollo:\n(Trying to avoid the problem? This is a murder trial, the killer is the problem!)Lamiroir:\nI... had to keep singing, even while I moved.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"You were... singing...?\"Apollo:\n(The contradiction between Lamiroir's testimony and the video... Unraveling an illusion can't be so different from solving a normal case... Right...?)Trucy:\nSorry, Apollo. I'm not telling. Not even if you make those puppy dog faces.Apollo:\n(...Fine, fine.)Apollo:\nYou were... singing...?Lamiroir:\nYes. Mr. Gavin expressed a dislike for recordings... So I used this.Apollo:\nWait... so you were singing the whole time? Even when you were crawling above the ceiling toward the backstage!?Lamiroir:\nWhy should it matter where I sing, when everywhere I go is the same darkness?Judge:\nB-But if you were singing while you were walking...Trucy:\nThat's right! Wouldn't the shooter and victim have heard? She was singing right over their heads, after all!Apollo:\nThat... is right!Klavier:\n...Are you sure?Apollo:\nYou'd have to be pretty hard of hearing to miss someone singing in the ceiling!Klavier:\nOnce again we come back to the state of the scene of the crime.Apollo:\nWhat state...?Trucy:\nAck... I know what he means! That old speaker, Apollo!Apollo:\nThe speaker!?Apollo:\nThat speaker was blaring at the time of the murder...Ema:\nAh, that's for monitoring the stage from this room.Trucy:\nMonitoring?Ema:\nIt pipes in a real-time feed from the stage microphones. Useful for knowing when your set is coming up.Klavier:\n...Satisfied? That dressing room was fitted with a large speaker playing a direct feed from the stage. ...At my request, actually.Apollo:\nSo Lamiroir singing in the ceiling... ...sounded just like Lamiroir singing over the speaker.Judge:\nIngenious! Her voice was hidden... by her voice!Lamiroir:\nAh...Apollo:\nLamiroir?Lamiroir:\nI... have just remembered something.Judge:\nDo tell!Lamiroir:\nWhen I heard the noise... the gunshots, yes? It startled me, so I...Apollo:\nSo you...?Lamiroir:\nI stopped singing.Judge:\nWhat...?Lamiroir:\nI forgot the words I was supposed to sing!!Apollo:\n(The song... stopped!?)Lamiroir:\nThankfully, it was the very beginning of the second verse. So not many would notice.Klavier:\nForehead! That mixing board I lent you! Where is it?Apollo:\nThe mixing... huh?Trucy:\nThat machine, Apollo! The one that breaks music into tracks!Apollo:\nOh, this! I'd completely forgotten about it... Let's take a listen!Sugar, Sugar...O that night, in your embrace.\nWhen you stole away the keysmy heart held on to so tight.\n\nPleasure...But a fleeting melodyApollo:\nThe song does stop there!Judge:\nIt does? I must have missed it...Apollo:\nLook at the lyrics sheet, at the top of the second verse. See where it says \"Pleasure, Pleasure...\"? Now listen again!When you stole away the keysmy heart held on to so tight.\nPleasure...But a fleeting melodyJudge:\n...This is evidence indeed! I believe we are guilty of making a terrible mistake.Apollo:\nThe crime didn't happen during the third set. It happened during the second, during Lamiroir's ballad.Judge:\nIf that is true... ...then no one on stage during the second set could have been the shooter!Apollo:\nWhich means that Daryan Crescend could have done it! He wasn't on stage for the second set!Klavier:\n......Apollo:\nWell, Prosecutor Gavin?Klavier:\n...Fascinating.Apollo:\n!Klavier:\nI don't believe I've ever seen a trial turned around quite so thoroughly. ...Yet one problem remains.Judge:\nWhat's that, Prosecutor Gavin?Klavier:\nHerr Forehead's theory does have a certain kind of logic to it. Yet it is entirely based upon Lamiroir's testimony.Judge:\nYes? Is there a problem with that?Klavier:\nWell, it's quite simple, though it pains me to say it. What if she is lying to protect the defendant?Apollo:Apollo:\nBut you have no proof...!Klavier:\nAll I'm saying is that the truth is as yet unclear. ...Until we hear directly from the man himself.Judge:\nThe man... you don't mean!?Klavier:\n...Yes. Though he is a friend, and band member, Daryan Crescend must take the stand. I see no other way.Judge:\nAs... someone with a new perspective on the case?Klavier:\n...As a suspect, to be frank.Apollo:\n(...Finally! The rat's coming out of his hole! And I'm ready to catch him! Daryan Crescend, get ready for Justice!)Judge:\nThis is as good a time as any to pause for a brief recess. The prosecution will summon the witness. Have him here and ready by the time we begin.Klavier:\n...I'm the last man who needs to be reminded of what his duties are.Judge:\nVery well, court is adjourned for a fifteen-minute recess!To be continued.July 10, 1:40 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2Trucy:\nApollo! I can't believe it! It really happened during the second act? A-And right in the middle of Lamiroir's performance!?Apollo:\nThe reason why she was in that air vent... (Changed from [Why she was in that air vent...] in the original release) ...and that \"switch\" and the flaming guitar. When you link it all together, that's what you end up with.???:\n...I knew you had what it took.Trucy:\nAh... Daddy!Apollo:\nMr. Wright! You... believed in me?Phoenix:\nNot really.Apollo:\nHuh?Phoenix:\nI just thought that'd make a cooler entrance than, say, \"hiya\"!Apollo:\n...Why do I even bother hoping?Trucy:\nWhere have you been lately, Daddy? You haven't been coming to the office at all!Phoenix:\nAh, sorry about that, Trucy. I'm on a... secret mission.Trucy:\nSecret? You mean like, you're undercover?Apollo:\nLike Mr. LeTouse, only shorter and not as well dressed.Trucy:\nOh no! What if you're shot, too, Daddy!?Phoenix:\nAh ha ha! Would I do a thing like that to you? Anyway, I'm off for a while again.Apollo:\nHuh? You're leaving?Phoenix:\nOh, one thing before I go.Apollo:\nWhat?Phoenix:\n............... Good luck.Apollo:\n...Right.Phoenix:\n......Apollo:\n...... Um... Is that all you came to say?Phoenix:\n...I think you have things pretty much under control. You'll get Machi Tobaye off the hook, no doubt.Apollo:\nYeah, but...Phoenix:\nBut you're after that detective, aren't you?Apollo:\nDaryan Crescend...Phoenix:\nIt won't be easy proving he did it. Especially not under the current court system...Apollo:\nThe current court system...?Phoenix:\nWhat did Prosecutor Gavin say during the trial? Your case is based on one fragile assumption. ...Namely, that our diva divine is telling the truth.Trucy:\nBut what about all the proof? The brooch... and the switch!Phoenix:\nA piece of jewelry, and a lyrical blunder... There are plenty of other ways to explain these things. The flaming guitar, too. ...All because you lack definitive proof of their connection to the case.Trucy:\nBut...!Phoenix:\nIf the sultry songstress is lying... ...your case melts like butter in a frying pan. Leaving behind the faintly singed scent of failure.Apollo:\nSo what do I do!?Phoenix:\nLike I said. Good luck. And be aware that it will be impossible to prove his guilt by conventional methods.Apollo:\nUgh...Phoenix:\nOh, that reminds me. I have something to give you from our detective friend.Apollo:\nDetective Skye... Ema!?Phoenix:\nLet's see. This bag of snacks here was meant for me... Ah, here it is.Trucy:\nWhat are those, Daddy? They don't look like very good snacking material.Phoenix:\nThey were found at the scene. Analysis of the fragments revealed traces of gunpowder.Trucy:\nGunpowder...!?Phoenix:\nProbably a firecracker or something similar, like the ones kids are into these days. These fragments were found under the sofa at the scene of the crime, actually.Apollo:\nUnder the sofa...Trucy:\nHey, Apollo! That's where we found that little device thingy!Apollo:\nRight... this. (Well, finally, some evidence that makes sense...)Burnt Fragments added to the Court Record.Examine evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBurnt Fragments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFragments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\nSo... you think this was some kind of firecracker?\nTrucy:\nYeah, or one of those noisemakers, like you shoot off on New Years!\nApollo:\nDid you know that in China, they use firecrackers on New Years to scare off evil? So, it's kind of same thing.\nTrucy:\nReally!? I had no idea! Well did you know this? It takes more than 500 peanuts to make one 12-ounce jar of peanut butter!\nApollo:\n(At least my useless fact had something to do with the evidence...)Phoenix:\nThat's all for me, I suppose. See you after the verdict. Maybe.Apollo:\nRight...Phoenix:\nEvery man has an igniter inside him.Apollo:\n...Excuse me?Phoenix:\nFind Daryan Crescend's igniter... and set it off.Apollo:\n(And he walked out the door, just like... just like a magician. Normally.)Trucy:\nUhh... What does he want us to do? No \"conventional methods\"? What does that mean?Apollo:\nI guess we just have to take his advice, and hope it makes sense when the time comes.Trucy:\nI guess...Apollo:\n(We're almost at the finish line. Hang in there, Trucy.)July 10, 1:55 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:\n...Court is now back in session. Prosecutor Gavin, where is Detective Crescend?Klavier:\nIn the witness lounge, ready to be called at any time.Judge:\nVery well.Klavier:\nMight I add... I don't believe any of this. He... Daryan was the first detective I ever worked with. We stopped working together when he moved to Criminal Affairs, Division 3... But his guitar playing... it fires my imagination!Apollo:\nThat's nice, but it has nothing to do with the matter at hand. ...Correct?Klavier:\nOh, I know. ...Herr Forehead.Judge:\nVery well, call the final witness to the stand! ...Detective Daryan Crescend!Klavier:\n...Name and occupation, please.Daryan:\nDaryan Crescend. Detective, Criminal Affairs, Division 3. That's the International Affairs Division, for those of you who didn't know. ...And I'm a guitarist for the Gavinners. Maybe you've heard of us?Judge:\nDo you fully understand the circumstances under which you stand before us today?Daryan:\nYeah, I understand, Your Honor. What I don't understand... is how you let this happen, \"partner\".Klavier:\n......Daryan:\nYou gave me your word I wouldn't be standing here.Klavier:\nThe situation's changed, Daryan... And don't call me \"partner\".Daryan:\nFeh. So much for old friends.Klavier:\n......Apollo:\n(I see what you're doing, Daryan. You're \"pressing\" the prosecution!) ...Your Honor, if we could begin the trial?Judge:\nYes, it's high time we did. Let's hear your testimony. You may begin with your response to Lamiroir's testimony. If, in fact you have anything to say about it.Daryan:\nOh I got plenty to say. Lying must be a national pastime in Borginia. ...And wherever you're from, Mr. \"Justice\". Hah!Apollo:\n...... (Conventional methods are out the window, huh... ...Here goes nothing!)Witness Testimony-- Daryan's Rebuttal --Daryan:\nThe diva's lying, plain and simple. She's got nothing to back up her story.\nIn the first place, she never heard my voice!\nShe \"forgot the words because she heard gunshots\"? As if!\nDidn't Detective Ema Skye hear those gunshots during the third set, anyway?\nThe shooting took place when I was on stage, man!Judge:\nHmm... So you claim Lamiroir's testimony was a lie?Daryan:\nHey, don't get me wrong, I dig what she's doing, trying to protect that kid. And she's got the court eating vague statements out of her hand just 'cause she's blind.Klavier:\n...You go too far, Daryan.Daryan:\nLook, all I'm saying is, you've got a reliable witness. Why not listen to the detective?Judge:\nDetective Skye...? Hmm... I see. Mr. Justice, you may begin the cross-examination.Apollo:\n(He didn't waste any time finding our weak spot... I can't do this with Lamiroir's testimony alone. I'll have to find some other way to prove when the shooting took place!)Cross Examination",

We have a report that it was something like a firecracker.\nApollo:\nEh... (How did Gavin know about this...?)\nKlavier:\nWhat? You think Detective Skye works for you? I received the report this morning, before coming here. That's when I made my decision, actually.\nJudge:\nWhat decision is this, Prosecutor Gavin?\nKlavier:\nI registered Daryan as a witness in today's trial. ...Just in case.\nDaryan:\n......\nApollo:\nThis raises another possibility. Those gunshot-like sounds during the third set... ...could have been two firecrackers rigged to go off by remote control!\nDaryan:\nHa ha! You got an active imagination, don't you? But you shouldn't say every little thing you think. Your explanation there seems a bit too convenient to me.\nApollo:\nHow so?\nDaryan:\nSo, you're saying these firecrackers just happened to go off... ...right when two witnesses came walking by? Hah!\nApollo:\n...!\nTrucy:\nThat's right! Daryan was out on stage when it happened, Apollo! How would he know someone was backstage right then!?\nDaryan:\nIf a firecracker goes off in the forest, and there's no one there to hear... You get my drift! Why go through the trouble, man!?\nApollo:\nUrk...! (How do I explain this...?)\nKlavier:\n...He may not look it, but Daryan is a gifted detective. Show any weakness, and he's sure to find it.\nDaryan:\n\"He may not look it\", partner? Gee, thanks, man.\nKlavier:\n...That reminds me. I happened to pass through that very hallway several times that day myself. And I saw something odd there just before the third set.\nApollo:\nSomething... odd?\nKlavier:\nA headset. The kind all of the band and staff members were wearing.\nApollo:\n...! (That's right! We picked this up in front of the door to that dressing room!)\nKlavier:\nWhat if that headset wasn't dropped, but placed? And what if it was turned on?\nApollo:\nYou could hear what was going on in that hallway! Even if you were out on stage!\nDaryan:\nFeh... Whose side are you on, Gavin?\nKlavier:\nListen to me, Daryan. There are no sides in a court of law.\nDaryan:\n......\nKlavier:\nIn any case...\nLeads to:\n\"I believe a case has been made.\"Daryan:\nIn the first place, she never heard my voice!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nYou never talked to her, even though you were playing in the same concert?\nDaryan:\nNot a word, as far as I can recall.\nApollo:\nBut, weren't there planning sessions or something?\nDaryan:\nGavin took care of all that himself.\nKlavier:\n...Daryan wasn't involved in any of the meetings with her.\nApollo:\nUgh...\nDaryan:\nAs if you can just go around remembering everyone's voice like that anyway. Only an idiot would believe that!\nApollo:\n(Lamiroir's hearing is very sensitive... She could remember him if she heard him, I'm sure of it... I just can't prove it. And I need proof!)Daryan:\nShe \"forgot the words because she heard gunshots\"? As if!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nWe know she missed the words. The mixing board proved it!\nDaryan:\nOh, yeah, there was a mistake. But blaming it on gunshots is just a lame excuse.\nApollo:\nWhat do you mean...?\nDaryan:\nThe mixing board proves what? It proves there was a mistake in the song. A missed cue. So? She just flubbed it up, big time. That's all. She spins this story about a gunshot to protect the kid... and cover for her own goof. Man, I'd have to hand it to her... if she wasn't sticking it to me at the same time.\nKlavier:\n...Daryan, watch what you say. Lamiroir is an artist. She \"just flubbed it up\"? That's no small accusation for a performer of her caliber.\nDaryan:\nHeh. She got to you, alright. I can see it in your eyes. I tell you, most of her stuff is so pretentious, it's way over my head.\nApollo:\n(I'm detecting a rift in the Gavinners's ranks.)\nDaryan:\nAnyway, she's too close to the defendant. Her testimony can't be trusted. You ask me, I'd go with Detective Skye's story at the drop of a pick.Present Mixing Board (if Igniter or Burnt Fragments was presented on fourth statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\n...It seems there was clear proof left behind. ...Right here in Lamiroir's song.\nDaryan:\nHer song...!?\nJudge:\nWhat exactly is this, erm, device thingy? A new variety of gramophone, perhaps?\nApollo:\n(C'mon, we just used this! And don't get me started on \"gramophone\"!) This device was used to record the performance part by part.\nJudge:\nPart...?\nKlavier:\nYou move the sliders to adjust the volume. Each instrument is adjustable separately. Lamiroir's voice included.\nJudge:\nHo hoh! ...But what does this prove?\nApollo:\nAccording to Lamiroir's testimony... At the moment of the shooting, she forgot the words to the song.\nKlavier:\nAh... You intend to examine the recording at that moment, ja? We might even hear those gunshots!\nApollo:\n...Exactly.\nDaryan:\nHah! Ridiculous. How are you supposed to hear gunshots back in that dressing room out on stage?\nKlavier:\nHave you forgotten, Daryan? We were all wearing these headsets.\nDaryan:\nOh...\nKlavier:\nWe were all deeply involved in our performance... ...but Lamiroir's headset would've picked up what she heard all the same.\nJudge:\nThen let's get to analyzing that recording! ...Right now!\nApollo:\n(Lamiroir stopped singing when she heard the shots fired...

You're crazy, man, crazy! An upstanding prosecutor like you even listening to this weak evidence!? Man, you can barely hear that! How do you know it's a gun?\nKlavier:\nPerhaps it is you who are hard of hearing, Daryan. It sounds like a gunshot to me.\nApollo:\nAdmit it! You lost, Detective Crescend!\nDaryan:\nOK, so what about the gunshots Detective Skye heard? You heard 'em, too, didn't you? Don't even think about telling me you were \"mistaken\"!\nJudge:\nWere you thinking of telling him that, Mr. Justice?\nApollo:\nNo, Your Honor. Detective Skye and I clearly heard what sounded like gunshots. But... they weren't!\nJudge:\nWh-What!?\nApollo:\nAnd I have evidence that proves it!\nDaryan:\n......\nKlavier:\nThen I think you'd best show it to the court. Let's see this evidence!\nJudge:\nIf you would, Mr. Justice!\nApollo:\nThe evidence showing what we really heard... is this!\n\n\n\nPresent Igniter or Burnt Fragments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Some things were found at the crime scene after yesterday's trial.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nThis is your \"gunshot\"!\nJudge:\n...That's your answer?\nKlavier:\nAnd I had such high hopes for you, Herr Forehead...\nJudge:\nI'm having trouble understanding how that piece of evidence is a gunshot... Next you'll be throwing pie plates in the air and calling them UFOs!\nApollo:\n(Even I wouldn't stoop quite that low...) S-Sorry, Your Honor. One more time, please?\nKlavier:\nWhy not. And... get it right this time, hmm?\nLeads back to:\n\"If you would, Mr. Justice!\"\n\n\nApollo:\nSome things were found at the crime scene after yesterday's trial.\nJudge:\nWhat things?\nApollo:\nThe first was this small device...\nKlavier:\n...That's the remote-triggered igniter.\nApollo:\nCorrect. And... one more thing.\nJudge:\nWhat are those? The remains of something burnt? Not another guitar, I hope!?\nKlavier:\nTraces of gunpowder were found on these fragments. We have a report that it was something like a firecracker.\nApollo:\nEh... (How did Gavin know about this...?)\nKlavier:\nWhat? You think Detective Skye works for you? I received the report this morning, before coming here. That's when I made my decision, actually.\nJudge:\nWhat decision is this, Prosecutor Gavin?\nKlavier:\nI registered Daryan as a witness in today's trial. ...Just in case.\nDaryan:\n......\nApollo:\nThis raises another possibility. Those gunshot-like sounds during the third set... ...could have been two firecrackers rigged to go off by remote control!\nDaryan:\nHa ha! You got an active imagination, don't you? But you shouldn't say every little thing you think. Your explanation there seems a bit too convenient to me.\nApollo:\nHow so?\nDaryan:\nSo, you're saying these firecrackers just happened to go off... ...right when two witnesses came walking by? Hah!\nApollo:\n...!\nTrucy:\nThat's right! Daryan was out on stage when it happened, Apollo!

There are no sides in a court of law.\nDaryan:\n......\nKlavier:\nIn any case...\nLeads to:\n\"I believe a case has been made.\"Daryan:\nDidn't Detective Ema Skye hear those gunshots during the third set, anyway?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nActually... I was there, too.\nDaryan:\nSo I hear. Which means you heard them, too, right? The gunshots.\nApollo:\nYes. We heard \"gunshots\". Neither I nor Ema actually saw the shooting, mind you.\nDaryan:\n...... Heh. I guess you and Lamiroir got the same excuse then.\nKlavier:\nWe know one thing for certain here. There were gunshot-like sounds that emanated from that room during the third set. What we must determine is whether those sounds were actually gunshots.\nTrucy:\nMachi heard them, too! Remember he said he ran for the air duct when he heard them?\nApollo:\n(So... how do we figure out just what those \"gunshots\" during the third set were?)Present Igniter or Burnt Fragments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nSome things were found at the crime scene after yesterday's trial.\nJudge:\nWhat things?\nApollo:\nThe first was this small device...\nKlavier:\n...That's the remote-triggered igniter.\nApollo:\nCorrect.

Whose side are you on, Gavin?\nKlavier:\nListen to me, Daryan. There are no sides in a court of law.\nDaryan:\n......\nKlavier:\nWhich is why I now turn to you, Herr Forehead. I've a question for you.\nApollo:\nHuh? For me...?\nKlavier:\nThe igniter and the burnt fragments that were found at the scene of the crime... It's certainly a possibility that they were part of a ruse to fake the sound of gunshots. Throw the headset from the hallway into the mix, and you could fabricate an alibi. But we're still no closer to proving anything. Those gunshots might have been real, or fake. We can't say.\nApollo:\nUgh...\nKlavier:\nYou've raised the possibility that the shots heard during the third set were faked. Now you need to prove the other half of the case.\nApollo:\nThe other half...?\nDaryan:\nLook, I'll just tell him.\nApollo:\n!\nDaryan:\nHe wants you to prove the thing went down in the second act... ...while our little piano player was on stage. That right, Gavin?\nKlavier:\nIndeed. If you can't prove that... ...then to continue this cross-examination would be pointless.\nJudge:\nHmm... Well, Mr. Justice? Can you prove the crime took place during the second set?\nApollo:\nUh... Yeah, I think...\nTrucy:\nYou'd better know, Apollo! Otherwise we're through...\nApollo:\nIt can be proven!\nKlavier:\n...You make it sound like someone else is going to come along and do it for you.\nJudge:\nLet's continue with the cross-examination then, shall we? Witness, your testimony, if you would.\nApollo:\n(This isn't going to be easy. I need some decisive proof, and fast...)\nDaryan:\nHeh... You ready, kid? 'Cause I am.\nChanges statement from \"Didn't Detective Ema Skye hear those gunshots during the third set, anyway?\" to \"The shooting took place during the second set? If you're so sure, let's see your proof.\"\nRemoves statement \"The shooting took place when I was on stage, man!\"Daryan:\nThe shooting took place when I was on stage, man!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nThat could have been what the shooter wanted us to think!\nDaryan:\nI'll tell you what the shooter, that kid, wants you to think. He wants you to think the diva heard me in that room.\nApollo:\n(Ack! I'm back to relying on Lamiroir's testimony!)\nKlavier:\nAs much as I'm enjoying the Daryan & Forehead show, there is no need for such tempers.\nApollo:\nDon't make us into some comedy duo.\nDaryan:\nThis mean the Gavin & Daryan show's cancelled?\nKlavier:\nNeither of your claims can be proven... or disproved. We could argue for days like this and get nowhere.\nJudge:\nProsecutor Gavin is quite right. This court will hear no further discussion on this topic without new facts.\nApollo:\n(New facts, huh...?)Present Mixing Board\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nRemember this, Detective Crescend?\nDaryan:\n...The mixing board?

How are you supposed to hear gunshots back in that dressing room out on stage?\nKlavier:\nHave you forgotten, Daryan? We were all wearing these headsets.\nDaryan:\nOh...\nKlavier:\nWe were all deeply involved in our performance... ...but Lamiroir's headset would've picked up what she heard all the same.\nJudge:\nThen let's get to analyzing that recording! ...Right now!\nApollo:\n(Lamiroir stopped singing when she heard the shots fired... Find that spot, and I'll find the gunshots!)\n\n\n\nPresent part 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor! Listen closely to this part!\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent any other part\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApollo:\n\nApollo:\nYour Honor! Listen to this part!\nJudge:\nWh-What's this!? ...... I hear nothing! How is this possible!?\nApollo:\n(Wait, isn't the judge hard of hearing?)\nJudge:\nI can hear just fine, thank you very much!\nApollo:\n(Ack! He heard me thinking!)\nJudge:\nI saw what you were thinking on your face.\nKlavier:\nHerr Judge's hearing aside, I, too, heard nothing. ...Leading me to believe there is nothing there to be heard.\nApollo:\n(Ugh... I guess that's the wrong spot.)\nJudge:\nA penalty, on behalf of all who are hearing-impaired, you insensitive braggart! Enjoy!\nApollo:\nUgh...\nJudge:\nMr. Justice! Once more, if you would!\nLeads back to:\n\"Lamiroir stopped singing when she heard the shots fired...\"\n\n\nApollo:\nYour Honor! Listen closely to this part! This is the track with Lamiroir's vocals!\n\n\nWhen you stole away the keysmy heart held on to so tight.\nPleasure...\n\nJudge:\n...I did hear something faintly there, yes! Why... it sounded like a gunshot!\nDaryan:\nWh-What!? This has to be some kind of mistake!\nLeads to:\n\"I believe a case has been made.\"Trucy:\nHe's pretty eager to paint Lamiroir as a liar, isn't he?Apollo:\nYeah, because her testimony is basically our entire case.Trucy:\nHmm... This is tough. So, what do we do?Apollo:\n...I've got a few ideas. (I just need to find another way to prove it didn't happen when he says it did!)Klavier:\nI believe a case has been made. Gunshots were heard during the second set. Which means Lamiroir's testimony... was true.Daryan:\n...Grah!Judge:\nOrder! So... she was telling the truth about what she heard?Lamiroir:\nIt was the other man speaking, not Mr. LeTouse.Judge:\nWell, what did he say!?Lamiroir:\n\"It's over. Press the switch! Now!\"Apollo:\nJust after that, there was a gunshot... and then the guitar caught on fire.Klavier:\nDetective Crescend... You weren't on stage during the second set. You could have done it.Judge:\nHmm... But why did we only hear one gunshot on the recording? Weren't two bullets fired from this weapon?Apollo:\nLamiroir was moving through the air vent, Your Honor. She must not have been close enough for her mic to catch the first shot. But then, as she passed over the dressing room... ...the gun fired again, and Mr. LeTouse's life was taken. Well, Detective Crescend?Daryan:\n......Klavier:\nAh, once again I am reminded of something.Apollo:\n...?Klavier:\nOur performance that day...Judge:\nYour performance?Klavier:\nSeeing the mixing board jogged my memory. You were there, too, Herr Forehead.Klavier:\nWhat is it with today!? Problem after problem! Achtung! My hog won't start. My guitar case is busted... ...my guitar's been burnt to a crisp, and to top it all off, someone's dead! ...And then there was that performance just now. What was that all about!?Apollo:\nThis part is off.Klavier:\nWhich is that? Hmm... 2nd Guitar.Daryan:\nAh.Klavier:\nIt was you Daryan!Klavier:\n...I thought it strange at the time. How could you miss such a simple cue? I know you, I know how you play. You're better than that.Daryan:\nYeah, well, I...Judge:\nYou what? And Prosecutor Gavin, what are you getting at?Klavier:\nI'm talking about the murder weapon. Mr. LeTouse's 45-caliber hand cannon. As we have learned, even the shooter doesn't go unscarred with a revolver that size. The kickback is enough to dislocate your shoulder, if you're an amateur.Apollo:\nWait...! You mean his playing was affected because he hurt himself shooting that revolver?Daryan:\nHah! You're forgetting something.Judge:\nYes, Detective Crescend...?Daryan:\nI am a trained police officer, you know. I've had firearms training. Plenty of it. I'm no amateur.Klavier:\nThe standard sidearm issued to police officers is a 38-caliber weapon. A much tamer beast. Also, the murder weapon belonged to the victim, Mr. LeTouse. ...Which suggests there was a struggle between killer and victim.Judge:\nSo... the killer might not have been holding the revolver correctly when he fired! Is that what you mean!?Klavier:\n...The thought had occurred to me, yes.Judge:\nWell, does the witness have anything to say to this?Daryan:\n......Judge:\nDetective Crescend!!!Daryan:\nWhat I want to ask is what Mr. Sleeves-rolled-up-ready-for-action has to say. Hey, you. Attorney.Apollo:\nMe?Daryan:\nExactly which piece of your evidence is decisive, again? You got a little noise on a tape that could be anything. And you have an alleged guitar cue miss due to a 45-caliber kickback. I weep for this case, Gavin, I really do.Klavier:\n......Daryan:\nYou can line up your little weak pieces of evidence all you want. I didn't shoot that manager. And that's the obvious truth.Judge:\nHmm... The witness has a point. The defense's arguments, while persuasive, are not decisive. I believe we should hear what the witness has to say in response to the case so far. ...Your testimony, please, Detective Crescend. Tell us your reasons why you couldn't have done it!Witness Testimony-- Proof of Innocence --Daryan:\nC'mon! Why would I even want to kill that manager?\nYou want a reason? Easy. I got no motive, man!\nThis was that diva's first trip to this country, right?\nHow could I possibly know her manager?\nIf I didn't know him, why would I want to kill him!?Judge:\nHmm. A simple reason, indeed. Prosecutor Gavin. Is it the case that Mr. LeTouse had not been to our country before?Klavier:\nAccording to our records... Yes. Not even once.Judge:\nI see... Very well! Mr. Justice, you may begin the cross-examination.Apollo:\n(Great, now I need to find a motive...)Cross Examination",

Well, Detective Crescend?\nDaryan:\nHeh heh heh. That's your game, is it? Guess I'd better confess, then.\nJudge:\n\"Confess\"...!?\nDaryan:\nYeah. It's a bit of an embarrassment... but I've never been sent overseas.\nApollo:\nWhat!? But you're in International...\nDaryan:\nSee, me and planes got a difference of opinion. We don't like each other much.\nKlavier:\nMy condolences, Herr Forehead, but he's telling the truth. He's never set foot outside the country.

Hmm... Looks like candy.Apollo:\nEr, it's not. Don't lick it, please. Detective Crescend. ...Ever seen this?Daryan:\n...Looks like a piece of candy.Apollo:\nWhat it is... is evidence. Don't lick it before you try it.Daryan:\n......Apollo:\nSpecifically, this is a replica of a cocoon... ...It was found among the victim's belongings.Judge:\nA cocoon? Never seen one that color.Klavier:\nIt is a variety only found in the Republic of Borginia. Nowhere else.Judge:\nAlright... But what is this cocoon replica doing in my courtroom? Surely, this has nothing to do with a motive for killing Mr. LeTouse! ...Does it?Apollo:\nIt does! ...Wait! I mean, I think it does.Daryan:\n...You don't sound so confident, man.Judge:\nA cocoon... Is it one of those silky cocoons? The kind that you can make, well, silk out of?Apollo:\n...Not this one. This cocoon makes a powerful \"curative\".Judge:\nA curative? For what...?Klavier:\nApparently, it is most efficacious at treating a disease thought incurable. It is the only medicine of its kind. ...However, it is illegal to take one of these healing cocoons out of Borginia.Judge:\nWhatever for? If it's such a miracle cure, why not share it with the world?Trucy:\nYeah, that's what I've been wondering!Klavier:\nWe looked into the matter at some length. Apparently, it isn't difficult at all to manufacture the remedy from the cocoon. Yet, if you change the process only slightly... ...you can easily make a large quantity of something else entirely. ...A deadly poison, in fact.Judge:\nWh-What!?Klavier:\nThere was an incident, several years ago, where some of these got out onto the black market. It caused quite the commotion in the global community. Though the media was kept largely unaware.Judge:\nHmm... Intriguing!Klavier:\nAll this has led to a strict ban on the cocoons' export. One rigidly enforced... by Interpol, among others.Judge:\nInterpol...Apollo:\nRight! The victim, Romein LeTouse, was an Interpol agent. Detective Crescend! You insist on referring to him as a \"manager\"... But that is misleading! Romein LeTouse wasn't killed as a manager! He was killed as an undercover agent!Daryan:\n...... So I was trying to smuggle this gumball into the country? That what you're trying to say?Apollo:\nI'm saying that could well be a motive for murder.Daryan:\nOh, so I was going to sell it on the black market, make myself a pretty penny? ...Ridiculous. I mean, totally unthinkable.Apollo:\n\"Unthinkable\", you say? Why?Judge:\nPerhaps it's time for another testimony... ...about this \"smuggling of cocoons\" business!Witness Testimony-- Cocoon Smuggling --Daryan:\nInternational Affairs got a memo about these cocoons.\nInterpol's all hot and bothered about 'em.\nCan't sell 'em on the black market. Too dangerous.\nYeah, cocoon smuggling ain't exactly lucrative anymore.\nMan, I'm in International Affairs! I know the deal!Judge:\nIndeed... Interpol wanted these cocoons bad enough to send Mr. LeTouse undercover.Daryan:\nYou kids think up the craziest things... But no way am I going to risk life and limb... ...just to get my hands on some dirty cocoon money!Judge:\nNot the most noble of statements, but duly noted.Klavier:\nAccording to reports, these cocoons top Interpol's list. Selling them to an underground organization would be risky.Judge:\nHmm... Very well, you may begin the cross-examination.Apollo:\n(This is the only motive I've got...

Nah, I'm just teasing. I've been great! I'm finally getting used to having my own place.Mia:That's good to hear. Actually, I'm calling because I have a favor to ask.???:I know, I know. You want me to hold evidence for you?Mia:Sharp as always! There's a lot of buzz about the upcoming trial... I just don't feel safe keeping the evidence here.???:I gotcha. So, what is it this time?Mia:It's... a clock.???:A clock?Mia:Yeah, it's made to look like that statue, \"The Thinker.\" And it tells you the time! I thought you might like it. You always liked toys.???:Hey! I'm not a little girl anymore, Sis!Mia:Now, now. You know I'm only teasing. Ah, I should probably tell you, the clock isn't talking right now.???:Huh? It's not working? That's lame!Mia:I had to take the clockwork out. Sorry. I put some papers inside it instead.???:Papers? Is that the evidence, then? Hmm, well... there's a possibility that it might turn out that way, yes.Mia:Can you come by the office tonight, say 9:00, to pick it up? I'll be in a pretrial meeting until then.???:Okay, Sis, but I expect dinner! Something good! Like... burgers! I could really go for a good burger.Mia:Okay, okay. We'll hit the usual joint.???:Alright! It's a deal! Okay, Sis, see you soon!Mia:Yep. I'll be waiting, Maya.Cellular:*beep*[Conversation recorded. September 5, 9:27 AM]September 5, 8:57 PMFey & Co.

That must be \"The Thinker\" that swallowed those papers.Mia:How could you know...????:Ho hoh. You are not cogniferous of my background? Gathering information is my business, you see.Mia:I... I should have been more careful.???:Ho hoh. My dear Miss Fey... I am so very sorry. But I am afraid I must ask you for one more thing. Your eternal silence... Farewell, Miss Fey.Mia:!!!Red... White... Blue...Episode 2Turnabout SistersSeptember 5, 9:08 PMFey & Co. Law OfficesPhoenix:Uh oh, I'm late. Huh, that's strange. The chief must have gone home already. She said her sister was coming over so we should all go out for dinner... ... What's that smell...? Blood...? Mia! (Maybe she's in her office!)ExamineAnywherePhoenix:I smell blood... and that can't be good! I have to check and see if Mia... the Chief's okay!Phoenix:That smell... Blood!???:... *sob* Sis...Phoenix:(Someone's there!) ...! Chief? Chief...?Chief!!!Phoenix:Who are you????:...Phoenix:(The strange girl dropped out cold. I left her lying on the office sofa. I went back to the chief where she lay under the window. Her body was still warm... I could feel it when I held her shoulder. Then, all too quickly, it began to fade... Until finally she was cold.)Phoenix:Chief...ExamineBroken glassPhoenix:Some shards of glass are scattered on the floor. They seem to be the remains of a glass light stand.ChairPhoenix:The chief's chair. A simple, functional design. Feels pretty good to sit in, too.Mia Fey's bodyPhoenix:Chief... It's hard seeing her like this, but if there are any clues here... She was struck on the head with a blunt object. She probably died instantly. \"The Thinker\" lying next to her must have been the murder weapon.The Thinker added to the Court Record.Phoenix:Hmm... there are some glass shards near the chief's body. Must be pieces of the glass light stand lying broken in the back of the room.Glass Shards added to the Court Record.Phoenix:Nothing else that seems like a clue here... Hmm...? A piece of paper! It must have fallen from Mia's hand! What could it be?Mia Fey's body (subsequent times)Phoenix:It's painful to look... but I have to, for Mia's sake. Looks like she was hit in the head with a blunt weapon. She probably died instantly.\"Maya\" scrap of paper (after examining Mia Fey's body; before clearing all Talk options at Fey & Co. Law Offices)Phoenix:! A word is written in blood on this scrap of paper! \"Maya\"...? Did Mia write this?

How ironic that this became the murder weapon... again.WindowPhoenix:There's a large building right across from the office. The \"Gatewater Hotel.\" A nice, luxurious place.BookshelfPhoenix:All the chief's important documents are packed in here. This is where she filed her case records and recent rulings.ComputerPhoenix:Surprisingly, the chief was never good with machines. About all she used this PC for was e-mail. She picked up this ancient model at some garage sale for practically nothing.DeskPhoenix:A perfectly normal office desk. The chief had a very particular policy about office d√©cor: \"Spend big on stuff the clients use, but keep your own stuff simple.\"Ledger bookPhoenix:The Fey & Co. ledger book. Everything is written in the chief's ultra-neat handwriting. It's a small office, but it makes a good bit of money.Corded phonePhoenix:Right! I'd better call the police! ...? That's funny... A few of the screws on the receiver are missing... It looks like someone was halfway through taking it apart.???:Police!? Please, come quick!Phoenix:(Wh-what was that!? Someone screaming from outside the window!?) ...! She's staring right at me! She's holding a phone in her hand...Corded phone (subsequent times)Phoenix:The phone receiver is missing a few screws.

So Mia was writing this girl's name! Maybe I should show her the receipt? I never thought there'd be a use for evidence like this outside the courtroom!)ExamineBookshelfPhoenix:You couldn't cram more legal books in here, even if you wanted to. Few can gaze upon the shelves without feeling insignificant.DoorPhoenix:The door to the chief's office. It's slightly open. I'd better not touch the door knob.PaintingPhoenix:A large painting. I guess you'd call this \"modern art.\" I, on the other hand, call it a mistake.Reception deskPhoenix:The reception desk. I usually sit here.SofaPhoenix:This sofa is for clients. It's leather... a real luxury model.Writing deskPhoenix:A small writing desk cluttered with office supplies.TalkWhat happenedPhoenix:(She seems to be in shock. I don't want to disturb her, but I have to know...) Um... excuse me? Can you tell me what happened?Maya:... I came in... The room was dark. And Sis... Sis...!Phoenix:(So she was already dead.)You and the ChiefPhoenix:So, you're the chief's...?Maya:Sister. I'm her younger sister.Phoenix:And you were here... visiting? This late at night?Maya:Yes. She said she wanted me to keep some evidence for her.Phoenix:Evidence...?Maya:Yes... I-it was that clock... It was \"The Thinker.\"PresentThe ThinkerPhoenix:Um, about \"The Thinker\"...Maya:! The Th-Thinker... That was... Oh, Sis! *sob*Phoenix:(Hmm, probably shouldn't have asked her about the murder weapon...)Glass ShardsPhoenix:This was lying next to the chief.Maya:I know. I saw it there too. I thought they might be pieces of the light stand.Phoenix:Hmm. Maybe. (Never heard of a glass light stand before...)Receipt (before examining corded phone in Office)Phoenix:Before Mia died, she wrote a message with her own blood. She wrote it on the back of this receipt.Maya:! Th-th-that's MY name! W-why!? Why would she write my name?Phoenix:Please, just calm down.Maya:W-why would Sis write my name?Phoenix:(Uh-oh. Now I've done it... I'd better hurry up and call the police!)Receipt (after examining corded phone in Office)Phoenix:Before Mia died, she wrote a message with her own blood.

Police!Gumshoe:Alright, I'm Detective Dick Gumshoe, see?Phoenix:(Gumshoe...? What an odd name.)Gumshoe:We received a report from the building across the way, see. Got a person saying they saw a murder.Phoenix:(It must have been that woman I saw.)Gumshoe:Anyway, I don't want either of you moving one inch, 'kay?Phoenix:(Great. Just great. Maya... Wait, she wouldn't have... nah.)Gumshoe:Whoaaaaaaaaaaaah! Scuze me!Maya:Eek!Gumshoe:This word \"Maya\" here mean anything to you?Maya:...! Um... that... That's my name...Gumshoe:WHAAAAT!?

You're coming down to the precinct, ma'am.Maya:W-what?Phoenix:Mia's younger sister, Maya, was arrested on the spot. I was taken in for questioning and didn't get out until the next morning. My eyes were heavy... but I couldn't sleep. I sat around, waiting for visiting hours to begin at the detention center. I had to talk to Maya as soon as possible.September 6, 9:07 AMDetention CenterVisitor's RoomPhoenix:(Wow, they have poor Maya locked up like a criminal.)Maya:Oh! It's you! The lawyer... G-good morning.Phoenix:Good morning! (She looks so tired...)Maya:Um... Are you going to be my attorney?Phoenix:Well, that's what I wanted to talk to you about...It's up to youPhoenix:(I'd better give it to her straight...) It's up to you.Maya:Up... to me?Phoenix:Yes. I don't think this is something I should decide. After all, you're the one in trouble here.Maya:... They're never going to believe me... are they? Even you, when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it!Leads to:\"Did I look at her like that?\"Of course I willPhoenix:(First things first, I better get her cheered up...) Yeah, of course I will! Cheer up!Maya:R-really...?Phoenix:(Whoa! Did I say the wrong thing? She looks sadder now!) Um... what... what's wrong? You don't think I can do it?Maya:... No... no one could! Who would believe me? Even you, when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it!Leads to:\"Did I look at her like that?\"Sorry, not a chancePhoenix:(Maybe if I joke a bit she'll cheer up...) Hah hah! No way, Jose! Just kidding...Maya:... ... ...Phoenix:(Eh heh. Whoops. That didn't go so well.)Maya:...Heh...Phoenix:Huh? M-Maya...? Was that a... chuckle?Maya:What? N-no! ... It wasn't very believable, was it?Phoenix:(Not really...)Maya:I-I'm sorry! I just thought, since you'd made a joke... Please, don't mind me! You're doing just fine!Phoenix:(Who's trying to cheer up who here!?)Maya:... I knew it. No one will believe me.Phoenix:What?Maya:Even you-- when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it!Leads to:\"Did I look at her like that?\"Phoenix:(Did I look at her like that?) No, no! I never thought...Maya:I-it's okay. I understand. ... And... I've also heard about you.Phoenix:Heard...? Heard what about me?Maya:I... was talking to my sister on the phone the other day...Mia:\"Today was my junior partner's first time in court.\"Maya:Wow! Really? How'd that go?Mia:\"It was quite the scene! Honestly, I was on edge the whole time. It's been a while...\"Maya:Hah! So, he crashed and burned?Mia:\"...He's a genius. One of those 'strike fear into the hearts of evil' types... The only thing he's lacking is... experience.\"Maya:Huh, sounds like it was fun! Well, I know who to go to if I ever get into trouble now!Mia:\"I don't know, Maya. I think you might want to wait... give him three more years. That is, unless you want to be found guilty.\"Maya:That's what she said!Phoenix:...Maya:I-I'm sorry! I didn't mean to trouble you...Phoenix:No, it's okay. It's true, I guess. But... at the same time, I can't just sit and watch! When I think of the person who did this to Mia...Maya:... I know...ExamineSecurity cameraPhoenix:Smile for the camera...Security guardPhoenix:This guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch. A real pro, this guy.TalkMayaPhoenix:There's something I've been wanting to ask you...Maya:Yes?Phoenix:What's with that outfit?Maya:Oh, this? This is what all acolytes wear. It's my uniform, you could say.Phoenix:A-acolytes? Like people in religious training? What is it you do?Maya:Oh! It's nothing strange, really! I'm a spirit medium. ...In training.Phoenix:A s-spirit medium!? (I'm pretty sure that qualifies as strange.)The day of the crimePhoenix:Could you tell me about the day of the murder?Maya:Yes! Let's see... that morning, I got a call from my sister. She wanted me to hold onto a piece of evidence for an upcoming trial.Phoenix:Evidence?Maya:Yes. That clock shaped like \"The Thinker.\"Phoenix:(The one Larry made...) How could that have been evidence in a case?Maya:Um, right, she said something about that... ... I remember! Do you want to hear it in her own voice?Phoenix:H-her own voice!?Maya:Yes. I'm pretty sure our conversation is on my cell phone.Phoenix:You recorded it!Maya:Yeah! I forgot how to delete those things.The day of the crime (after clearing \"Your cell phone\" Talk option)Phoenix:Could you tell me about the day of the murder? Sorry... I know it must be hard.Maya:No, it's okay. All I've been doing the last few hours is talking about it. I've kind of gotten used to it... Let's see... that morning, I got a call from my sister. She wanted me to hold onto a piece of evidence for an upcoming trial.Phoenix:(That's \"The Thinker\" clock that Larry made. It practically qualifies as a serial murderer by now.) So then, when did you arrive at the office?Maya:It was right around 9:00. The lights were off and... I could smell blood. Th-then I found her. My sister...Phoenix:Thanks, Maya. That's all I need to hear for now.Your cell phone (appears after \"The day of the crime\")Phoenix:So, you say you have a conversation with your sister on your cell phone? Let's hear it!Maya:Right! Oh! I just remembered: that detective took my cell phone. Sorry.Phoenix:Oh, right. (Of course...)

A, er, medium-in-training.Maya:That's right. The Fey family, especially the women, have always been very sensitive to the spirit world.Phoenix:Wait a second, you said the \"Fey Family\"? So, Mia was into this stuff too?Maya:Of course! She left the mountain to \"follow her career,\" she said. Her powers were first-class, too!Phoenix:(I... I had no idea.) Hmm... Wait...!Maya:What?Phoenix:So, you're a real, honest-to-goodness spirit medium? With E.S.P. and all that?Maya:Yes. ...In training.Phoenix:Well, can't you contact Mia's spirit, then? We can just ask her who killed her!Maya:...! I-I'm sorry... I'm still in training. I couldn't do something on that level...Phoenix:(Hmm... I thought that would be too easy.)PresentThe ThinkerPhoenix:I wanted to ask you about the murder weapon...Maya:Poor Sis... *sniff*Phoenix:(Hmm. Better not ask her about this now.)Glass ShardsPhoenix:This was lying next to the chief's body...Maya:I saw that too. They said they thought these were pieces of a broken light stand.Phoenix:Yeah, that seems about right. (Though I'd never heard of a glass light stand before this...)ReceiptPhoenix:Remember that receipt?Maya:Y-you mean the one with my name on it?Phoenix:Any idea why she...Maya:Absolutely none! Um... Do you trust me?I trust youPhoenix:I trust you.Maya:Why? Don't you think I did it, too?Phoenix:No, I don't. (It's just a hunch, but...)Maya:That detective thinks I did it.Phoenix:...Leads back to Court RecordI don't trust youPhoenix:...Maya:I didn't think you'd believe me. You're just like the detective.Phoenix:I'm sorry... I don't like lying just to make people feel better. But it doesn't mean that I've decided you did it! (She seemed so lost at the crime scene.)Leads back to Court RecordMaya's MemoPhoenix:I wanted to ask you about your cell phone...Maya:That detective took it when they brought me in.Phoenix:(So, Gumshoe took it... I'll have to try to get it back next time I see him...)Anything elseMaya:Sorry... I've never seen that before.After clearing all Talk options:Maya:... Um...!Phoenix:Huh? Something the matter?Maya:Um... I was wondering, could I ask you a favor?Phoenix:...?Maya:This is the address of a famous lawyer. My sister gave me this a long time ago. She said if I was ever in trouble, I should call him. And, well, I'm in trouble. Do you think you could go ask him to represent me?Phoenix:(Hmm...)AcceptPhoenix:Sure, why not? I'll go ask.Maya:Thank you so much! I have no one else to turn to...Phoenix:...? Say, what about your parents...?Maya:... ... ...Phoenix:I... I see. Don't worry, leave it to me.Maya:Thank you! The trial's tomorrow... at 10:00.Phoenix:W-what!? Tomorrow!?Maya:Tomorrow.Phoenix:What if this guy refuses!?Leads to:\"They told me that if I don't find one, the state will pick an attorney to defend me.\"RefusePhoenix:I'm sorry... I think this is the kind of thing you should really do yourself.Maya:...You're right. ...Phoenix:Something wrong?Maya:Actually, I asked the police to contact him, and they tried calling a few times. Nobody could get a hold of him!Phoenix:They couldn't find him?Maya:I have no one left to ask!Phoenix:...? Say, what about your parents...?Maya:... ... ...Phoenix:O-okay! Don't worry, I'll go ask him for you.Maya:Y-you will? Thank you so much!Phoenix:I'm just worried what will happen if I can't find him.Leads to:\"They told me that if I don't find one, the state will pick an attorney to defend me.\"Maya:They told me that if I don't find one, the state will pick an attorney to defend me.Phoenix:When will that happen?Maya:They're giving me until 4:00 this afternoon.Phoenix:(And visiting hours are almost up... I'd better hurry!) Right, I'll be back!September 6Fey & Co. Law OfficesPhoenix:(The office is filled with police officers. They're all busily searching for clues...)???:Hey! You there! This is a crime scene, pal! No trespassing! Umm... Sorry, don't I know you from somewhere? Wait, you're that Butz guy, aren't you!Phoenix:No, no, Phoenix Wright. (How could anyone mistake me for Larry!?)???:Ah, guess I got the wrong name, Mr. Wright. Sorry 'bout that. That Butz guy, he was a killer! And you're no killer! Right?Phoenix:(He WAS proven innocent...) Umm... right. And you were...Detective GumshoePhoenix:Um... Gumshoe, wasn't it? Dick Gumshoe????:Right! At your service. Hang on!

And don't go calling me \"Dick\"...\"Gumshoe:Anyway, get the name right. And don't go calling me \"Dick\"...Police:Hey, Dick! Get over here!Gumshoe:Y-yes, sir! B-be right there! Umm... ahem! You're her lawyer, right, pal? If you got business here, you'd better do it quick!Phoenix:(Whew! He thinks I'm Maya's lawyer...!)ExamineBookshelfPhoenix:There's a horrendous amount of legal books here. Scarier still is that Mia probably read all of these.HouseplantPhoenix:Mia's favorite potted plant. I remember it had this bizarre name no one could ever remember.???:\"Cordyline stricta,\" pal!Phoenix:(Who was that!?)Mia's deskPhoenix:Mia's desk. Perfectly clean, as always. The only thing it's missing is... Mia.Movie posterPhoenix:An old movie poster. Apparently, this was the first movie that made Mia cry when she saw it. I'll have to check it out one of these days.WindowPhoenix:The sky is blue, and so am I... There's that hotel, right across the way.TalkMiaPhoenix:About Ms. Fey... did you do an autopsy?Gumshoe:Hmm? You want to know the results, eh?Phoenix:...Gumshoe:Now don't you look at me like that, pal! It's no use! She might have been your boss, but that doesn't mean you get any special treatment. Alright, alright. You can see the report, but that's all!Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.Mia (subsequent times)Phoenix:So, Mia's death was instantaneous.Gumshoe:That's right, pal. She was... a beautiful person.Phoenix:You knew her, Detective?Gumshoe:Sure. All of us down at the precinct knew Ms. Fey. Much as it pains me to say this, she was a darn good lawyer. Hey, what are you looking at? I just got a little dust in my eye, that's all.MayaPhoenix:Um, about Maya...Gumshoe:Yeah! I'm looking forward to the trial! Sorry, pal, but this is one trial you aren't going to win!Phoenix:W-why do you say that?Gumshoe:The city's put Prosecutor Edgeworth on the prosecution!Phoenix:(Edgeworth...)Gumshoe:I'm sure you know what that means, you being a lawyer and all.Edgeworth (appears after \"Maya\")Phoenix:Prosecutor Edgeworth...Gumshoe:That's right, pal! Mr. Miles Edgeworth himself! Wait... you do know him, don't you!?Of course I do!Phoenix:I know him. He's a feared prosecutor. He doesn't feel pain, he doesn't feel remorse. He won't stop until he gets his \"guilty\" verdict.Gumshoe:Aww, don't talk about him that way. You make him barely sound human! Still, I'm afraid this pretty much decides the case.Phoenix:(So, Edgeworth is on this one... He hasn't lost a case since he became prosecutor at the incredibly young age of 20. Of course, there are rumors of back-alley deals and forged evidence...)Leads to:\"All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion.\"Of course not!Phoenix:Never heard of him.Gumshoe:Whoa! And you call yourself a lawyer, pal!? About four years ago, this Edgeworth guy became a prosecutor at the age of 20! Everyone says he's a genius. Surprised you don't know him!Phoenix:(Of course I know him... I was just playing dumb. He's a cold, heartless machine who'll do anything to get a \"guilty\" verdict! There are rumors of back-alley deals and forged evidence...)Leads to:\"All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion.\"Phoenix:(All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion. I never imagined I'd be facing him so soon...)PresentThe ThinkerPhoenix:I was wondering, do you know anything about this?Gumshoe:That statue? That's the murder weapon.Phoenix:(Huh? He thinks the clock is just a statue, too... I'm starting to wish I'd never seen this thing.)Glass ShardsPhoenix:There was broken glass at the crime scene, right?Gumshoe:Hmm? Oh, that? Seems like a glass stand next to the victim fell over. The glass shards were pieces of the broken stand.ReceiptPhoenix:There was a piece of paper next to the victim, wasn't there?Gumshoe:Yeah. The one with the killer's name written on it!Phoenix:Are you sure that Mia wrote it herself?Gumshoe:Given the condition of the writing, it's hard to say if it's her handwriting or not.Phoenix:(So there's no proof that Mia wrote it.)Maya's MemoPhoenix:I was wondering... did you see Maya Fey's cell phone?Gumshoe:Oh that? I have that.Phoenix:Do you think you could give it back?Gumshoe:Sure! I mean, wait a second, pal! Tricky lawyer!Phoenix:(Uh-oh, he's on to me!)Tell him straightPhoenix:(Hmm... if I tell him why I want it there's no way he'll give it to me!)Gumshoe:Something the matter?Phoenix:Oh, no, it's just... You know, Detective!Gumshoe:Nope. I know nothing, pal!Phoenix:That cell phone has a lot of numbers on it... like her boyfriend's... A cell phone holds all a little girl's sweetest and spiciest secrets!Gumshoe:Urk? Y-you're trying to confuse me! Sorry, pal. I already checked all the numbers in memory!Phoenix:Impressive! You're quite the detective.Gumshoe:Uh huh. Oh, here, you can have the phone back.

She... was worried it might get lost if it went down to the precinct.Gumshoe:That what she said?Phoenix:Um. Yes.Gumshoe:... Okay, pal. I wrote down all the numbers she called anyway.

Sorry, pal, but I got no info for the likes of you!After clearing \"Mia\" and \"Maya\" Talk options and presenting Maya's Memo:Phoenix:(I guess I've asked all the questions I need to.)Gumshoe:You all done, pal?Phoenix:Um, yes, thank you. I'll be heading out now.Gumshoe:Oh, wait. One more thing I wanted to mention to you. I don't suppose you're planning on talking to that witness. Anyway, you'd better not! No influencing the witness with your lawyerly ways, pal!Phoenix:... (Come to think of it, I had completely forgotten about her...) The... witness?Gumshoe:Yeah, Miss April May. I'm sorry 'bout this... But I can't tell you anything about her!Phoenix:(Well, you just told me her name. Miss May, huh?) So you've sent her home already, then?Gumshoe:Ahah! You're trying your lawyerly tricks on me now! She's not to go outside her room until the trial!Phoenix:(So... she's still in the hotel across the way.)

She couldn't say when he'd be back. It must be hard to keep track of everything when you're a famous lawyer... Not to mention run an office like this.

Hmm... funny... they don't look like they've ever been read.DeskPhoenix:A solid mahogany desk.

No idea what kind of plant it is, but it's probably the most expensive one available.TablePhoenix:A table for clients. Hmm... an elegant ebony case, and if I'm not mistaken, that lighter's made of solid gold.

Did you meet the lawyer?Phoenix:Sorry. I haven't seen him yet.Maya:I see...Phoenix:(Hmm.

And I don't know where my mother is.Phoenix:(Don't know...? So she could still be alive?)Your mother (appears after \"Your family\")Maya:The women in my family have been mediums for generations. They say a lotta spiritual power runs in our blood. (Changed from [They say that E.S.P. runs in our blood.] in the original release) About fifteen years ago, our family was involved in an... incident. There was a man, and he... he... He ruined our mother's life.Phoenix:(\"Ruined\"...?)Maya:After that, she disappeared. Several years after that, my sister announced she would \"become a lawyer\" and she left the mountain.Phoenix:... So, you live by yourself?Maya:Yes. I've gotten used to it. Oh, also... I had to become independent, or I would lose my powers!

It made quite a stir, everyone was talking about it, apparently. The police were running out of leads, and they were getting desperate...Phoenix:Wait... they didn't use a spirit medium, did they?Maya:The police convinced my mother to try to contact the victim.Phoenix:Wow... So, what happened?Maya:The case was solved... we thought.Phoenix:You \"thought\"...?Maya:The man my mother helped the police capture was innocent.Phoenix:...!Maya:The police's consultation with a medium had all been carried out in secret, of course. But... A man found out about it and leaked it to the press. He told all the papers that my mother was a fraud, and the media jumped on it big time. She... my mother... became the laughing stock of the nation.Phoenix:I see.Maya:... White...Phoenix:Excuse me? White?Maya:That was his name. My sister told me.Phoenix:White? Hmm...PresentMaya's Cell PhonePhoenix:Hey, I got your cell phone back.Maya:Oh! Say... Can I listen to my sister's voice?Phoenix:... (Maya's eyes closed...

I wonder what's inside? Let's take a look...)April:Hey! H-h-hey!!! What are you doing!? No touching! Oooh. Bad boy! Y-you really shouldn't pry around in other people's rooms, now.

    "content": "Testimony: 5  \nEvidence: 2  \n\nExplanation: The testimony states that the witness saw the defendant hit the victim with \"that clock,\" which is identified as \"The Thinker,\" a statue-like clock that was the murder weapon. However, the evidence (The Thinker) and Mia's Autopsy Report (Evidence 6) indicate that the victim died instantly from a single blow at 9:00 PM. If the victim had dodged the first attack and only then was hit, as April stated, the timing and nature of the weapon suggest a contradiction: the victim could not have dodged the first blow because the fatal blow was singular and instantaneous. This calls into question the claim that the victim escaped an initial attack before being struck with the clock."

Scarier still is that Mia probably read all of these.HouseplantPhoenix:Mia's favorite potted plant. I remember it had this bizarre name no one could ever remember.???:\"Cordyline stricta,\" pal!Phoenix:(Who was that!?)Mia's deskPhoenix:Mia's desk. Perfectly clean, as always. The only thing it's missing is... Mia.Movie posterPhoenix:An old movie poster. Apparently, this was the first movie that made Mia cry when she saw it. I'll have to check it out one of these days.WindowPhoenix:The sky is blue, and so am I... There's that hotel, right across the way.TalkMiaPhoenix:About Ms. Fey... did you do an autopsy?Gumshoe:Hmm? You want to know the results, eh?Phoenix:...Gumshoe:Now don't you look at me like that, pal! It's no use! She might have been your boss, but that doesn't mean you get any special treatment. Alright, alright. You can see the report, but that's all!Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.Mia (subsequent times)Phoenix:So, Mia's death was instantaneous.Gumshoe:That's right, pal. She was... a beautiful person.Phoenix:You knew her, Detective?Gumshoe:Sure. All of us down at the precinct knew Ms. Fey. Much as it pains me to say this, she was a darn good lawyer. Hey, what are you looking at? I just got a little dust in my eye, that's all.MayaPhoenix:Um, about Maya...Gumshoe:Yeah! I'm looking forward to the trial! Sorry, pal, but this is one trial you aren't going to win!Phoenix:W-why do you say that?Gumshoe:The city's put Prosecutor Edgeworth on the prosecution!Phoenix:(Edgeworth...)Gumshoe:I'm sure you know what that means, you being a lawyer and all.Edgeworth (appears after \"Maya\")Phoenix:Prosecutor Edgeworth...Gumshoe:That's right, pal! Mr. Miles Edgeworth himself! Wait... you do know him, don't you!?Of course I do!Phoenix:I know him. He's a feared prosecutor. He doesn't feel pain, he doesn't feel remorse. He won't stop until he gets his \"guilty\" verdict.Gumshoe:Aww, don't talk about him that way. You make him barely sound human! Still, I'm afraid this pretty much decides the case.Phoenix:(So, Edgeworth is on this one... He hasn't lost a case since he became prosecutor at the incredibly young age of 20. Of course, there are rumors of back-alley deals and forged evidence...)Leads to:\"All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion.\"Of course not!Phoenix:Never heard of him.Gumshoe:Whoa! And you call yourself a lawyer, pal!? About four years ago, this Edgeworth guy became a prosecutor at the age of 20! Everyone says he's a genius. Surprised you don't know him!Phoenix:(Of course I know him... I was just playing dumb. He's a cold, heartless machine who'll do anything to get a \"guilty\" verdict! There are rumors of back-alley deals and forged evidence...)Leads to:\"All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion.\"Phoenix:(All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion. I never imagined I'd be facing him so soon...)PresentThe ThinkerPhoenix:I was wondering, do you know anything about this?Gumshoe:That statue? That's the murder weapon.Phoenix:(Huh? He thinks the clock is just a statue, too... I'm starting to wish I'd never seen this thing.)Glass ShardsPhoenix:There was broken glass at the crime scene, right?Gumshoe:Hmm? Oh, that? Seems like a glass stand next to the victim fell over. The glass shards were pieces of the broken stand.ReceiptPhoenix:There was a piece of paper next to the victim, wasn't there?Gumshoe:Yeah. The one with the killer's name written on it!Phoenix:Are you sure that Mia wrote it herself?Gumshoe:Given the condition of the writing, it's hard to say if it's her handwriting or not.Phoenix:(So there's no proof that Mia wrote it.)Maya's MemoPhoenix:I was wondering... did you see Maya Fey's cell phone?Gumshoe:Oh that? I have that.Phoenix:Do you think you could give it back?Gumshoe:Sure! I mean, wait a second, pal! Tricky lawyer!Phoenix:(Uh-oh, he's on to me!)Tell him straightPhoenix:(Hmm... if I tell him why I want it there's no way he'll give it to me!)Gumshoe:Something the matter?Phoenix:Oh, no, it's just... You know, Detective!Gumshoe:Nope. I know nothing, pal!Phoenix:That cell phone has a lot of numbers on it... like her boyfriend's... A cell phone holds all a little girl's sweetest and spiciest secrets!Gumshoe:Urk? Y-you're trying to confuse me! Sorry, pal. I already checked all the numbers in memory!Phoenix:Impressive! You're quite the detective.Gumshoe:Uh huh. Oh, here, you can have the phone back. There weren't any suspicious call records in there, after all.Leads to:\"Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation...\"Tell him not-so-straightPhoenix:(Okay, I can't be straight with this guy... but what should I tell him?)Gumshoe:Something the matter?Phoenix:Oh, no, um...

It makes Mia's death seem so... routine.)Maya's Cell PhonePhoenix:(Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation...)Anything elseGumshoe:Hmm? What's that?

I'll be heading out now.Gumshoe:Oh, wait. One more thing I wanted to mention to you. I don't suppose you're planning on talking to that witness. Anyway, you'd better not! No influencing the witness with your lawyerly ways, pal!Phoenix:... (Come to think of it, I had completely forgotten about her...) The... witness?Gumshoe:Yeah, Miss April May. I'm sorry 'bout this... But I can't tell you anything about her!Phoenix:(Well, you just told me her name. Miss May, huh?) So you've sent her home already, then?Gumshoe:Ahah! You're trying your lawyerly tricks on me now! She's not to go outside her room until the trial!Phoenix:(So... she's still in the hotel across the way.) I guess I should know better than to try to get a detective to leak information.Gumshoe:You got that right, pal!Phoenix:(Time to pay a visit to Miss May!)September 6Grossberg Law OfficesPhoenix:(According to the receptionist, the big boss is \"out\". She couldn't say when he'd be back. It must be hard to keep track of everything when you're a famous lawyer... Not to mention run an office like this. I guess I'll just have to come back later.)ExamineBookshelfPhoenix:Expensive-looking mahogany bookshelves, filled with expensive-looking books. Hmm... funny... they don't look like they've ever been read.DeskPhoenix:A solid mahogany desk. The wood's been polished to a deep luster.PaintingPhoenix:That painting has been bugging me ever since I stepped in here. The oil paint is so thick it's practically giving me a stuffed nose. I'm sure the price is nothing to sneeze at either, for that matter.Potted plantPhoenix:An expensive potted plant. No idea what kind of plant it is, but it's probably the most expensive one available.TablePhoenix:A table for clients.

Did you meet the lawyer?Phoenix:Sorry. I haven't seen him yet.Maya:I see...Phoenix:(Hmm. I'd better go see if I can find this elite lawyer she's talking about.)TalkYour familyPhoenix:What about your family?Maya:I only had my sister. My father died when I was very young. And I don't know where my mother is.Phoenix:(Don't know...? So she could still be alive?)Your mother (appears after \"Your family\")Maya:The women in my family have been mediums for generations. They say a lotta spiritual power runs in our blood. (Changed from [They say that E.S.P. runs in our blood.] in the original release) About fifteen years ago, our family was involved in an... incident. There was a man, and he... he... He ruined our mother's life.Phoenix:(\"Ruined\"...?)Maya:After that, she disappeared. Several years after that, my sister announced she would \"become a lawyer\" and she left the mountain.Phoenix:... So, you live by yourself?Maya:Yes. I've gotten used to it. Oh, also... I had to become independent, or I would lose my powers! (Changed from [I had to become independent, or I would lose my E.S.P.!] in the original release)Phoenix:(I feel bad for her, all by herself up on that mountain...)Your mother's enemy (appears after \"Your mother\")Phoenix:So, who was this man who, um, \"ruined\" your mother?Maya:About 15 years ago... there was an unusual murder case. It made quite a stir, everyone was talking about it, apparently. The police were running out of leads, and they were getting desperate...Phoenix:Wait... they didn't use a spirit medium, did they?Maya:The police convinced my mother to try to contact the victim.Phoenix:Wow... So, what happened?Maya:The case was solved... we thought.Phoenix:You \"thought\"...?Maya:The man my mother helped the police capture was innocent.Phoenix:...!Maya:The police's consultation with a medium had all been carried out in secret, of course. But... A man found out about it and leaked it to the press. He told all the papers that my mother was a fraud, and the media jumped on it big time. She... my mother... became the laughing stock of the nation.Phoenix:I see.Maya:... White...Phoenix:Excuse me? White?Maya:That was his name. My sister told me.Phoenix:White?

I wonder what's inside? Let's take a look...)April:Hey! H-h-hey!!! What are you doing!? No touching! Oooh. Bad boy! Y-you really shouldn't pry around in other people's rooms, now.

However, Evidence 10 (May Testimony) says \"The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck,\" meaning the victim did not successfully escape but was caught and attacked. This creates a contradiction regarding whether the victim managed to get away or was caught after fleeing right."

    "content": "Let's analyze the two pieces:\n\n- Testimony 2 states: \"The victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right.\"\n- Evidence 10 states: \"The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck.\"\n\nBoth statements describe the victim dodging an attack and running to the right. The only extra detail in Evidence 10 is that the victim was caught and struck afterward, but this does not contradict the core fact that she dodged and ran to the right.\n\nThus, logically, there is no contradiction between Testimony 2 and Evidence 10.\n\n----\n\nHere's the Python code to verify contradictions for this case:\n\n```python\ndef verify_contradiction(testimony: str, evidence: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns True if there is a contradiction between testimony and evidence,\n    False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Simplify both strings to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison\n    t = testimony.lower()\n    e = evidence.lower()\n\n    # Check if the testimony and evidence agree on:\n    # - victim dodging an attack\n    # - victim running to the right\n\n    # If testimony says victim dodged, evidence should also say so\n    dodged_in_t = \"dodged\" in t\n    dodged_in_e = \"dodged\" in e\n\n    # If testimony says victim ran to the right, evidence should also mention it\n    ran_right_in_t = \"ran to the right\" in t\n    ran_right_in_e = \"ran to the right\" in e\n\n    # If testimony indicates dodging and running right but evidence denies them ‚Üí contradiction\n    if dodged_in_t and not dodged_in_e:\n        return True\n    if ran_right_in_t and not ran_right_in_e:\n        return True\n    \n    # No contradiction found\n    return False\n\n\n# Example usage:\ntestimony_2 = \"The victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right.\"\nevidence_10 = 'The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck.'\n\nprint(verify_contradiction(testimony_2, evidence_10))  # Expected output: False\n```\n\n----\n\n**Answer:** False (No contradiction).\n\n**Explanation:**  \nBoth the testimony and evidence agree on the victim dodging an attack and running to the right. The additional information in evidence that she was caught and struck afterwards does not contradict the testimony. Therefore, there is no contradiction between them."

Given the context and the testimonies and evidences below,\nidentify ONE testimony and ONE evidence where the evidence can be used to identify a contradiction with the testimony.\n\nCONTEXT:\n\n-- Witness's Account --Sahwit:I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Isn't a man leaving an apartment a common sight? I find it odd you would take notice of him...Sahwit:Er... heh. I don't know. He just seemed strange to me, that's all. Like he was mad, and yet frightened at the same time. Just like... a criminal fleeing the scene of a crime!Phoenix:The defense requests that the witness refrain from conjecture!Payne:Of course. What the witness means is that the man he saw looked suspicious. So, what happened next?Sahwit:I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Half-open... you say?Sahwit:Yes, yes, the door was open halfway. Yes. I watched for a moment, but no one came to close the door. \"That's odd, in a big city like this,\" I thought...Payne:I see. And what happened next?Sahwit:Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:What gave you the idea to do that?Sahwit:Well, the door was half-open, you see. Isn't it only human to want to... peek? We climb mountains because they are there! It's the same thing.Payne:Truer words have never been spoken! Anyone would look inside!Phoenix:(Hmm... why did Payne cut him off so quickly?)Payne:So, you looked into the apartment. What happened then?Sahwit:Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Are you sure she was dead?Sahwit:W-Well, no, I guess I wasn't. But, she wasn't moving at all, and there was blood everywhere.Phoenix:(I guess that would look fatal to anyone...) Very well, what happened next?Sahwit:I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:So, you didn't touch ANYTHING in the apartment?Sahwit:Um, yes. I mean no! Nothing.Phoenix:Okay. What happened next?Sahwit:I thought to call the police immediately!PressPhoenix:Phoenix:You \"thought\" to call the police? Does that mean you didn't actually call them!?Payne:Please, please... Listen to the rest of the testimony. You thought to call the police... What happened next?Sahwit:However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:The phone in her apartment wasn't working?Sahwit:Yes. I mean, no. No, it wasn't. Right. (Changed from [Yes. I mean, no, no it wasn't. Right.] in the original release)Phoenix:But you said you didn't go into the apartment... or did you!?Sahwit:Oh, oh, that? I can explain that! There was a cordless phone on a shelf in the entranceway. I reached inside and tried using that to call...Payne:And the phone wasn't working, correct? What happened next?Sahwit:I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Why use a public phone?Sahwit:Well, you see, I don't have a cell phone. And, being the middle of the afternoon, there was no answer at the nearby apartments.Phoenix:Ah, right... what time did you call again?Sahwit:I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:1:00 PM! Are you certain?Sahwit:Yes. Absolutely.Phoenix:(Hmm... He seems really confident.)Mia:1:00 PM? Wright. Doesn't that seem strange to you? Present some evidence to contradict him!Present Cindy's Autopsy ReportPhoenix:Leads to:\"You found the body at 1:00 PM. You're sure?\"Sahwit:The man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Are you absolutely, 100% positive?Sahwit:Yes, it was him. No mistake about it.Payne:The witness says he's certain!Mia:That's all of it. There must be a contradiction in there somewhere. Examine the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab] if something strikes you as being suspicious. (Changed from [Examine the Court Record button if something strikes you as being suspicious.] in the original release) Then, find the evidence that contradicts his testimony, and present it to the court!Phoenix:You found the body at 1:00 PM. You're sure?Sahwit:Yes. It was 1:00 PM, for certain.Phoenix:Frankly, I find that hard to believe! Your statement directly contradicts the autopsy report. The autopsy notes the time of death at sometime after 4PM. There was nobody to... er... no \"body\" to find at 1:00 PM! How do you explain this three-hour gap?Sahwit:!!! Oh, that! Oh, er...Payne:Payne:This is trivial! The witness merely forgot the time!Judge:After his testimony, I find that hard to believe. Mr. Sahwit... Why were you so certain that you found the body at 1:00 PM?Sahwit:I... er... well, I... Gee, that's a really good question!Mia:Great job, Wright! Way to put him on the spot! That's all you have to do: point out contradictions! Lies always beget more lies! See through one, and their whole story falls apart!Sahwit:Wait! I remember now!Judge:Would you care to give your testimony again?Witness Testimony-- The Time of Discovery --Sahwit:You see, when I found the body, I heard the time.There was a voice saying the time... It was probably coming from the television.Oh, but it was three hours off, wasn't it?I guess the victim must have been watching a video of a taped program!That's why I thought it was 1:00 PM!Terribly sorry about the misunderstanding...Judge:Hmm... I see. You heard a voice saying the time on a taped program. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Mia:Wright! You know what to do!Phoenix:I've got this one.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Time of Discovery --Sahwit:You see, when I found the body, I heard the time.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:You said \"heard\"... Not \"saw\"?Sahwit:Yes, heard. All I saw was the body lying there... I didn't think to look at anything else, least of all my watch.Phoenix:Hmm... Isn't that a little strange? So you're saying you \"heard\" something. But if you were so shocked by the body, you wouldn't hear anything at all!Payne:Payne:The witness did say he actually heard the time. It's ludicrous to suggest he \"wouldn't hear anything\"!Judge:Hmm... I have to agree with the prosecution. Witness, continue your testimony.Present Blackout RecordPhoenix:Leads to:\"Hold it right there!\"Sahwit:There was a voice saying the time... It was probably coming from the television.PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Are you sure it was a television and not... a radio?Sahwit:Well, no, I guess it might have been a radio.Payne:Incidentally, there was no radio on the premises. There was only one large television.Mia:Wright! I can't put my finger on it, but something about this seems fishy. Something about \"hearing\" the television...Payne:The witness has testified. He heard the time.Present Blackout RecordPhoenix:Leads to:\"Hold it right there!\"Sahwit:Oh, but it was three hours off, wasn't it?PressPhoenix:Phoenix:How do you explain the gap!Judge:Well, witness? Can you explain this?Present Blackout RecordPhoenix:Leads to:\"Hold it right there!\"Sahwit:I guess the victim must have been watching a video of a taped program!PressPhoenix:Phoenix:A... video?Sahwit:Yes, that would explain why the time was wrong!Phoenix:True, true...Mia:Wright! I think the problem lies someplace else...Judge:We're agreed that you heard the time at the scene, then.Present Blackout RecordPhoenix:Leads to:\"Hold it right there!\"Sahwit:That's why I thought it was 1:00 PM!PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Are you sure the voice you heard said it was 1:00 PM?Sahwit:Yes, I can practically hear it now. It was quite clear.Judge:Mr. Payne, has the prosecution verified this testimony?Payne:My apologies, Your Honor. I, too, have only just learned that the witness \"heard\" the time.Sahwit:Oh, I'm really sorry. I only remembered it just now.Present Blackout RecordPhoenix:Leads to:\"Hold it right there!\"Sahwit:Terribly sorry about the misunderstanding...PressPhoenix:Phoenix:Well, you just watch it! (Hmm... Not much point pressing him on that one, was there?)Mia:Notice anything suspicious?\n\nTESTIMONIES:\nTestimony 1: You see, when I found the body, I heard the time.\nTestimony 2: There was a voice saying the time...

Since the power outage would make it impossible for the television to operate and produce any sound during that time, the testimony contradicts the evidence."

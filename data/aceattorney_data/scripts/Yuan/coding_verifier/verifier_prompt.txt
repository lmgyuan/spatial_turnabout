Testimony 1: Actually, I didn't \"hear\" the time... I \"saw\" it!
Testimony 2: There was a table clock in the apartment, wasn't there!
Testimony 3: Yeah, the murder weapon! The killer used it to hit the victim!
Testimony 4: That must have been what I saw.

Evidence 1: Attorney's Badge
Description 1: No one would believe I was a defense attorney if I didn't carry this.

Evidence 2: Cindy's Autopsy Report
Description 2: Time of death: 7/31, 4PM-5PM. Cause of death: loss of blood due to blunt trauma.

Evidence 3: Statue
Description 3: A statue in the shape of \"The Thinker\". It's rather heavy.

Evidence 4: Passport
Description 4: The victim apparently arrived home from Paris on 7/30, the day before the murder..

Evidence 5: Blackout Record
Description 5: The victim's power was out from 7/31, 4PM to 8/1, 10AM.

Based on the above testimony and evidence, Testimony 3 and Evidence 3 are chosen as candidates for verification.

Here is a code that can be used to verify there is a contradiction between a testimony and an evidence.
```python
def main():
    # Load the testimony and evidence
    weapon_from_testimony = "Statue"
    weapon_from_evidence = "Clock"
    
    if weapon_from_testimony == weapon_from_evidence:
        # Thers is no contradiction
        return False
    else:
        # There is a contradiction
        return True
```

Now, similarly, here is are lists of evidences and testimonies.

{testimonies}

{evidences}

Write a code that can be used to verify there is a contradiction between the testimony and the evidence.

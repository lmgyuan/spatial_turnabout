      "evidence": "Evidence:\n[0] Name: Monokuma File #2\nDescription: The victim was Chihiro Fujisaki. The time of death is estimated to be around 2:00 a.m. The body was discovered in the girls locker room, on the 2nd floor of the school. The cause of death was a blow to the head with a blunt object. She was killed instantly.\n\n[1] Name: Sakura's Account\nDescription: Although Chihiro wanted to get stronger, she declined several invitations from Sakura and Aoi, and may have used the locker room late at night to avoid them. Despite this, Chihiro had stated that she desired help with her efforts. She may have been meeting someone in the locker room the night she was murdered.\n\n[2] Name: Locker Room Dumbbell\nDescription: The dumbbell found on the floor of the girls locker room had a significant amount of blood on it.\n\n[3] Name: <a href=\"/wiki/Mondo_Owada\" title=\"Mondo Owada\">Mondo</a>'s Account\nDescription: Chihiro had told anyone willing to listen that she wanted to get stronger. Some assume that due to her inferiority complex about being weak, she admired strength more than anything else.\n\n[4] Name: Card Reader\nDescription: To unlock a locker room, you need to swipe your e-Handbook over the card reader. You need a male student's handbook for the boys locker room, and a female student's for the girls. It is not possible for two people to enter at the same time. Additionally, lending someone your handbook is a violation of school regulations.\n\n[5] Name: Main Hall e-Handbook\nDescription: The handbook of each student that has died is placed in the mailbox in the main hall.\n\n[6] Name: Broken e-Handbook\nDescription: One of the handbooks found in the main hall had been broken, which is apparently a rare occurrence. Junko and Sayaka's handbooks both seem to still work, so it is assumed that the broken handbook is Leon's. However, Monokuma claims it's very unlikely that Leon's handbook would have broken.\n\n[7] Name: Genocide Jack Case File\nDescription: Suspected Genocide Jack victims include Ken Harada, Tetsuhiro Honda, and Shoji Gaku, among countless others. They were killed in the same way, and mounted to a nearby wall. The word \"bloodlust\" was found at the scene of each crime, written in blood. Profiling indicates the killer is likely a student suffering from a split personality.\n\n[8] Name: Aoi's Account\nDescription: Chihiro seems to have consciously kept her distance from the other girls at the school, even from the beginning. Meanwhile, it had been noticed that she got along remarkably well with her male classmates.\n\n[9] Name: Boys Locker Room Carpet\nDescription: The carpet in the boys locker room was found with a blackish stain on it.\n\n[10] Name: Two Locker Room Posters\nDescription: Blood was found on the poster in the girls locker room. The poster featured a big-breasted supermodel popular among young boys. Meanwhile, the poster in the boys locker room was for a boy band popular with teenage girls.\n\n[11] Name: Chihiro's e-Handbook\nDescription: Chihiro's handbook was not found on her corpse, and has apparently gone missing.\n\n[12] Name: Status of the Dead Body\nDescription: Chihiro's body had been suspended, and her hands had been bound with some kind of rope. Her fatal injury was a blow to the head.\n\n[13] Name: Disappearing Stain\nDescription: Sakura mentioned that she was responsible for a coffee stain on the girls locker room floor. However, the stain had since been inexplicably scrubbed away.\n\n[14] Name: Celeste's Account\nDescription: On the night of the murder, right before \"nighttime,\" Chihiro was spotted leaving the warehouse. It seems she was stuffing some blue exercise clothes into a duffel bag. Presumably she was on her way to exercise, but the clothes were not found at the crime scene. Celeste had not told anyone other than Makoto about this encounter.\n\n",

The time of death is estimated to be around 1:30 a.m. The body was discovered in Makoto's room, in the dormitory.The death took place in the bathroom. The cause of death was a stab wound to the abdomen, and her right wrist appears to have been fractured.\n\n[1] Name: Evidence of a Struggle\nDescription: There are a number of scratches and gouges on the bed and walls in Makoto's room.\n\n[2] Name: Replica Sword\nDescription: Makoto took this from the gym entryway and put it in his room.

The sword handle was missing some of the gold coating, as was part of the blade\n\n[3] Name: Replica Sword Sheath\nDescription: Makoto took this from the gym entryway and put it in his room. The sheath was found some distance from the sword itself, and it shows evidence of being scratched with a sharp object. If you were going to attack someone with the sword, you would almost certainly remove the sheath first.\n\n[4] Name: Switching Rooms\nDescription: On the night of the murder, Makoto and Sayaka traded rooms and room keys. When the victim was discovered, Makoto's room key was also found in Makoto's room. Sayaka had originally asked Makoto to switch with her when someone attempted to force their way into her room, and she became frightened.\n\n[5] Name: Toolkit\nDescription: This had been placed in Makoto's room before he arrived. It remains unopened, and there is no evidence of it having ever been used. All the other male students claim that they haven't used theirs, either. But still...\n\n[6] Name: Makoto's Room's Cleanliness\nDescription: Not a single hair was found on the floor at the scene of the crime. In addition, the lint roller shows evidence of being used.\n\n[7] Name: Sayaka's Wrist\nDescription: Sayaka's right wrist had been fractured, and her wrist was \"glittery\" at the injury's location. In addition, her hands appeared to be completely clean, except for the index finger of her left hand, which had some blood on it.\n\n[8] Name: Dying Message\nDescription: A series of numbers had been written in blood on Makoto's bathroom wall\u201411037.

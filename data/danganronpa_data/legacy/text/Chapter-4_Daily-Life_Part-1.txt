Leon killed Sayaka...
Monokuma killed Junko...
Then Leon got executed...
Then Mondo killed Chihiro...
And then he got executed...
Hifumi killed Taka...then Celeste killed Hifumi...
Then *she* got executed...
And that brings us up to now...

The next morning, in the dining hall...the day after Celeste's case...
13-Hina14.png
: So now there's only five of us here...
14-Hiro13.png
: Only a third of the number of people we started with...
15-Kyoko17.png
: Loneliness has become commonplace.
16-Sakura4.png
: That't true...
17-Makoto.png
: ...
Still...

What did I see yesterday? I don't understand... Sakura is the mastermind's spy? Can that really be true?
22-Sakura3.png
: Makoto, are you okay?
17-Makoto.png
: Ah--! N-No, I'm fine...!
I can't bring it up in front of the others. If I did that...it would just confuse everyone that much more.
23-Kyoko13.png
: ...
25-Hina22.png
: Okay! In that case, let's eat till we pass out!
26-Hiro7.png
: Whaddya mean, "In that case"?
27-Hina2.png
: Well, cuz look how scary everyone looks! It's gotta be cuz you're all fighting on empty stomachs, right? If you fill your belly, I'm sure you'll all cheer up! So, let's eat!
28-Hina18.png
: Let's fry up some fish and donuts and eat till we can't stand up!
29-Hiro8.png
: That's like a Deep Impact style, meteor impact, extinction level event combination of foods...
30-Hina11.png
: What!? Those are both breakfast time top sellers!
32-Kyoko5.png
: Still, the "till we can't stand up" part is a problem. After we're done, we need to go
explore
.
33-Sakura6.png
: That's right. Since the class trial is over, new areas should have opened up...
15-Kyoko17.png
: Plus, we still have
Alter Ego
. We don't have to give in to despair just yet.
17-Makoto.png
: She's right... We have to plan ahead and think about the future!
35-Hina5.png
: Yeah, yeah! Think happy thoughts! Not deathy thoughts!
36-Hiro18.png
: Like when we're gonna get outta here, right? When this is all over...I think I wanna get reborn for serious. Er--I mean, reborn AS someone serious...
37-Hina12.png
: Hey, are you okay? That sounds like something someone who's about to die would say...
38-Hiro2.png
: I'm totally okay! I'm not gonna die! Why? Cuz there aren't gonna be any more murders!
39-Hina9.png
: Huh? What makes you so sure...?
38-Hiro2.png
: I predicted it last night! Since it revealed itself to me from the ether, there's no doubt about it!
41-Sakura7.png
: ...How accurate is your fortune-telling, anyway?
42-Hiro15.png
: I can usually hit twenty or thirty percent on a good day!
37-Hina12.png
: That seems...really low.
43-Hiro14.png
: Well, yeah! It's not like it's ESP or whatever. Of course I'm only gonna get it right sometimes!
44-Hiro16.png
: I told you, my fortune-telling isn't like some occult thing!
39-Hina9.png
: Fortune-telling...isn't occult?
46-100MileJunkFoodDash.png
44-Hiro16.png
: Of course not! Clairvoyance is clarivoyance! Don't put it in the same category as cattle mutilation!
37-Hina12.png
: Cattle... What?
47-Kyoko3.png
: He's referring to the urban legend where aliens abduct cows and dissect them as part of their research.
48-Hiro12.png
: No...! You're calling it an urban legend!? As a matter of fact, it's true... As a matter of fact, it's happened to me!
38-Hiro2.png
: It all happened one day when I went to go get a hamburger... It was a place I'd never been before. They claimed their patties were
100% all beef
... So I got a burger to go and headed home. And before long...the sky was filled with a mysterious blinding light!
50-BurgerAbduction.png
38-Hiro2.png
: Some crazy beam came out of nowhere and locked on to my hamburger! And as soon as the beam touched it, the burger started floating in mid-air...! And then, still floating there, the entire burger started coming apart! One part of it just vanished, while the rest fell back into my hand...! Do you realize what that means? It means, the burger wasn't 100% beef! It must've had some pork or something mixed in... Something like seventy percent pork and thirty percent beef, would be my guess.
48-Hiro12.png
: So I stormed back into the burger place and got up in the manager's grill. And they totally admitted it... It WASN'T 100% beef! They totally mixed in ground pork with it!
42-Hiro15.png
: Now do you see!? THAT is cattle mutilation!
17-Makoto.png
: I...kinda got lost halfway through...
53-Hina23.png
: I can't tell if you're for the occult or against it. You stink of stupidity...
44-Hiro16.png
: I stink of--!? How dare you!?
53-Hina23.png
: Well, you do stink, though.
38-Hiro2.png
: That's fine!
37-Hina12.png
: That's fine!?
17-Makoto.png
: U-Umm...anyway... I hope your prediction turns out to be true...
55-BeautifulMorning.png
56-Hiro3.png
: Well, at the very least, *I* won't murder anyone!
25-Hina22.png
: Me either! I mean, I would never!
16-Sakura4.png
: Me either...
57-Kyoko2.png
: Nor I.
17-Makoto.png
: That goes for me too, of course. I could never kill any of my friends!
I felt like those words of encouragement were helping us come together as one. After so much sacrifice and hardship...we'd finally become united. But...
16-Sakura4.png
: To be honest, I wish Byakuya and Toko were here for this, too.
13-Hina14.png
: But...they're so hard to deal with. They only think about themselves.
43-Hiro14.png
: Yeah, we're better off without 'em, I say...
That was enough to prove... We were united for the time being, but within that bond hid
weakness and fragility
.

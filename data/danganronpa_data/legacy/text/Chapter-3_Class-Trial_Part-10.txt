I don't understand what's happening.
I don't know what started it...
It's all over...
And with that I opened my eyes. I didn't know how long it had been.

: G...gh... Oww...
Apparently, something hit me, and I lost consciousness. That's all I understood. The dull, throbbing pain in my head proved that much at least.
An empty bookshelf... Huh? Empty...?
4-Makoto2.png
: Gone... It's all gone!
The yearbooks...the student registry...and...even the note that had fallen on the floor. It's all...gone?

: What does this mean...?
But my brain refused to do any more work. The insistent pain in my head began to spread across the rest of my body.
4-Makoto2.png
: F-For now... I should go back to my room... Get some rest...
My body was heavy with pain, my mind heavy with thought. I dragged myself back toward my room.
Somehow, I made it back to the 1st floor of the school.

: Gh... Nng...
The farther I walked, the more I felt... Things are getting blurry... Can't see...in front of me...
I couldn't stop myself from collapsing right there. And after that...
"..."

: Hm...?
"..."
As if from a vast distance, I heard a sound...
"..."
It was faint, but undeniable...
"..."

: That sound... It's coming from...the gym...?
As I desperately hauled my shaky frame toward the gym the sound for stronger and stronger.
*KRAK* *DGAH*
*GAGUNK* *BAGYAH*
What's going on...? It can't be nothing... Here...in the gym...?

I didn't make a sound as I opened the door to the gym... The sounds coming from inside, meanwhile, only intensified that much more.
*Kacha! Bakyu!*
*Hagagya! Hiya! Paching!*
*Bakya! Dadadun! Shashashasha!*
Before me there raged a battle beyond anything humanly possible. No...one side's not human, that's for sure. But... Regardless, I couldn't stop staring. I forgot to move, or even breathe...

: Why you...! What do you think you're doing?
21-Sakura13.png
: ...
20-Monokuma20.png
: I asked you a question! What's the meaning of this? How dare you defy me...? This wasn't part of the deal!
The deal...?
21-Sakura13.png
: I've made a decision... I will no longer retreat, no longer compromise, no longer regret... I've made my decision! I'm going... to resist you!
20-Monokuma20.png
: Hmm... Okay. But...you do realize what will happen if you go through with this, right? You haven't forgotten, have you? What I'm holding hostage...?
21-Sakura13.png
: ...!?
... What am I looking at...? What am I hearing...? A hostage?
Then...could it be...? The mastermind's spy is...

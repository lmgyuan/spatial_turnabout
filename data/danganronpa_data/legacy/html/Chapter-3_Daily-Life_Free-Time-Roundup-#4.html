   : ...Dreams are meant to change as you grow up, right? Depending on where you're at--kindergarden, elementary school, junior high, high school...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Junko3.png"/>
   : But I've had the same dream since I was a little kid, and I've been rushing toward it ever since. So I've never really had to think all that hard about my dreams.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Makoto.png"/>
   : But what's wrong with that? It just means you still feel the same way about it, right?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Junko2.png"/>
   : That's what I used to think. But if it doesn't change, your possibilities can't grow, right? That's how new opportunities are born.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Junko7.png"/>
   : And up until now, I never did that. I never let my dreams grow... All I saw was that one dream. I put everything I had into that one narrow little world... I feel like there's so much more I could be doing that I'm not, and I don't like that feeling... So I think I'm going to start looking for it... Is it childish of me to think like that? Am I just being a baby?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Makoto.png"/>
   : No, not at all... I'm the same way. I'm still trying to figure out what it is I want to do. And sometimes I feel like I'll never find it... I feel like maybe I'll spend the rest of my life looking for it... But I'm not sure it's even about finding it or not finding it. Maybe the important thing is that you're *looking* for it.

   : N-No, that's not what I was trying to--
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Junko2.png"/>
   : But you could be right.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Junko9.png"/>
   : Getting lost can be a good thing! As long as you're looking for it, maybe that's enough to be happy...

    I'm glad I was able to talk to Junko like this. I think I understand her a lot better now... I feel like maybe we've finally become

     friends

    in the truest sense of the word.

   : But before I can do what you said, I gotta get out of here first! So I'm definitely gonna find out how to get out...!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Maybe if she stopped yelling at nobody about how to get out, she'd find a way... Well, I guess it's okay. She can do things however she wants. After such a nice conversation with Junko, I went back to my room.

   : This unlocks the skill
   <b>
    Charisma
   </b>
   . If you've taken damage during a trial, this skill will replenish more of your Influence Gauge than you usually get back from answering questions correctly. It's a useful skill if you're playing through the first time, except that to get it you basically have to know Junko has it from the start. You have to devote all three of the Free Times in Chapter 1 to her, which I doubt most newcomers would do. Good skill, badly hidden.

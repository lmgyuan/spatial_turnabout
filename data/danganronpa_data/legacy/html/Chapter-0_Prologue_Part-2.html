   <i>
    I woke up with my head resting on top of a hard wooden desk. My body feels...heavy. It's pretty normal for me to zonk off in the middle of some boring class or whatever, but... What was I doing asleep here just now? This isn't a classroom I've ever been in before.

   : Welcome to Hope's Peak Academy! Firstly, we'd like to explain the basic controls. You can use the left stick to adjust your aim. You can also tap the touch screen to place the reticle. If you aim at an object you can interact with, you can press the X button or tap the screen... And presto! You'll investigate that object. Use the directional buttons or the L and R buttons to adjust your viewpoint. Why don't you try looking around the classroom?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-007.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Narration.png"/>
   : Welcome to the gameplay. As the tutorial text said, you can move the cursor to suspicious objects to examine them. It's not unlike an adventure game. Lots of objects are just there for flavor text.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Narration.png"/>
   : I'm recording this LP from a Playstation TV, so I don't have access to the touch controls the Vita version of the game allows for. This means I can't comment on how useful they are but I find using the analog stick to move the cursor to be no problem at all.
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Narration.png"/>
   : When you move the cursor over something that you can examine, you'll see this line with a magnifying glass trail out from the object. Then just push X to see what it is.

    It's a dangerous world we live in. I guess they have these to keep weirdos from just wandering in.

    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-010.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    In any normal classroom, that's where a window should be. But it looks like some kind of metal plate has been bolted over it. And if I were to knock on it...
   </i>
   <b>
    *Bang bang*
   </b>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Yup. Definitely metal. Thick, too. Very solid.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Wait, that's not what matters here. More importantly, why are there metal plates over the windows?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-011.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It was just after 7 when I first got here. Has it really been almost and hour since then?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-012.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The school *is* funded by the national government, so I guess it's not that weird to have TVs in here... Something feels...off. I wonder what it is...

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Narration.png"/>
   : Alright, so the object on the desk is the most obvious thing we'd want to check. Let's see what it is.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    That's the desk I fell asleep on. I can still see a line of drool I must have left there.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Makoto2.png"/>
   : I'll have to clean that up later...

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Makoto2.png"/>
   : An orientation guide...? It's some kind of cheap-looking pamphlet. And there's something handwritten on it.
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Okay, let's see. So what might have happened is...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    I got myself so wound up, I passed out in the main hall. And then someone carried me here...? If that's true it must mean... This is a classroom inside Hope's Peak.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Makoto2.png"/>
   : But then if *that's* true...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    That just raises more questions. This is all really strange. I mean, those metal plates covering the windows... It's like it's a prison or something. None of this makes any sense...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Makoto2.png"/>
   : I should probably head back to the main hall. It's already past the meeting time. There might be other students there now.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Tutorial.png"/>
   : You can leave the classroom by pressing the Circle button.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Narration.png"/>
   : So let's go see what the hallway looks like.

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Jeez... This hallway is kind of weird, too.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    This is getting stranger by the second. I honestly have no idea what's going on...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Well, for now I'll just head to the main hall...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Tutorial.png"/>
   : Use the left stick to move through the hallway. Hold down the Circle button while moving to run.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-016.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Tutorial.png"/>
   : Also, you can press the Triangle button to bring up a map. Press the Triangle button again to close the map. How convenient!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Narration.png"/>
   : The hallways are full 3D spaces. You can walk around in them to get to wherever you need to go. If I remember right, in the original PSP version, you couldn't run with Circle until you got a skill for it later on. This version doesn't do that and instead lets you run from the start. How convenient, indeed.
   <br/>
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Narration.png"/>
   : So we started in classroom 1-A. There's also a classroom 1-B right over here, though we can't enter it right now.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-018.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    "Despair Hotel"...? I guess it's a place for people to stay overnight. But anyway, I need to get to the main hall...!

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Narration.png"/>
   : There are a variety of other doors around the area but they all give similar messages when you examine them. This open one in the middle of the hall is the door we're looking for.
   <br/>

   ???: So counting him, that makes fifteen. Seems like a good cut-off point, but I wonder if this is everyone.

    Standing before me were the

   : Yup! Now here's some good news. Act now, and I'll throw in an extra bonus on your reading! I used white magic to record a CD of spirit messages I received from the luxury suite of heaven! Five seconds of this baby, and you'll be witnessing miracles and communing with angels for days!

   : Mm, ahem, this is a school announcement. It is now 10 p.m. As such, it is officially
   <b>
    nighttime
   </b>
   . Soon the doors to the dining hall will be locked, and entry at that point is strictly prohibited. Okay then...sweet dreams, everyone! Good night, sleep tight, don't let the bed bugs bite...

   : After I declined the offer to become a shrimp, the tech support lady just refused to drop the issue. Once the shrimp idea was dead, she came back suggesting I should become a crab instead. How much can one person love crustaceans!? I said no, of course, and she shot back... "Okay, then how about to make you extra special, you can be a crab that walks sideways AND backwards!" But how's that any better!? I don't wanna go sideways of backwards! I wanna go FORWARD! I heard her annoyed sigh on the other end of the line, then she said... "You just don't see the splendor of the crab. Haven't you ever heard of The Tale of the Crab and the Monkey?" Of course I've heard of it! I know all about it! But so what!? The crab beats the monkey, but it's just some legend. Hardly relevant to our greed-obsessed modern society! Sure, *monkeys* still show up in movies and stuff from time to time, but not crabs! Monkey-themed clothes are sweeping the fashion world, but the crab doesn't stand a chance, right? What I'm saying is, crabs have no place in today's light-speed world! Do your market research, lady! Which is why I chose the always-popular bear image. And that's the secret origin story of Monokuma...

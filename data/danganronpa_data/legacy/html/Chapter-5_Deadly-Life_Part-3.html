    Well...I'd better start by checking out the Monokuma File...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    "Due to the explosion, the victim's identity is unknown. They were, however, dead before the blast. The victim had been stabbed a single time with a knife, which went completely through the body. They had also been struck in the head with an object about as thick as a metal pipe. The body was covered with other wounds, but these were at least several days old."
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : So even the Monokuma File doesn't tell us who the victim actually was...

    The unidentified body... Could it really be Kyoko...? Or...?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-222.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I have no choice... I have to investigate. I have to uncover the truth for myself... No matter what, I have to find out what happened. Or we're all dead...!

    Okay, time to get started. I need to check anywhere that may be important, from one end to the other. I just need to do what I always do...

   <br/>
   <i>
    If I check the body more thoroughly...maybe then I'll find out for sure if it's Kyoko or not.

   : Huh...? There's something weird about the body's fingernails... Oh, these are
   <b>
    fake nails
   </b>
   . They're really long... They seem like they'd get in the way of normal activity.

   <br/>

    There's also something on the back of her right hand... Is this...a
    <b>
     tattoo
    </b>
    ? It got burned, so I can't make out the whole thing, but... It looks like it's
    <b>
     a picture of a dog
    </b>
    or something. I've never seen anything like it before.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-233.png"/>

    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-234.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The upper half of the body got set on fire in the explosion, so it's totally blackened... Also, the
    <b>
     top half
    </b>
    of the body is wet.
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-FlashT.png"/>

    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-FlashB.png"/>
    <br/>
    That's because it got set on fire, and I threw water on it... Since I only threw water on the part that was on fire--the top half--the bottom half is still dry. In other words, there's nothing strange about
    <b>
     the top half
    </b>
    being wet. There...isn't, right?
    <br/>
    <br/>

    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-238.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The lower half of the body didn't get wet at all... After the body blew up, the top half got set on fire, so I dumped a bucket of water on it. Which explains why the bottom half isn't wet. There's nothing strange about that...right?

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    These...look like fragments of something. They're all burnt, so I can't really be sure, but...I feel like I've seen something like it before. But where...?

    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-FlashB.png"/>

    It must be the knife that was stuck in the body before it exploded. The force of the explosion must have thrown it over here...

    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-247.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The Monokuma File said the knife went all the way through the body, from front to back. Does that mean this knife is what caused the
    <b>
     fatal injury
    </b>
    ...? ...Either way, this knife... It looks really familiar...

   : It was wearing some kind of mask, and a big white coat. Also, there was a knife sticking out of the stomach, and the area around it was stained with blood... Apparently, the wound had stopped bleeding, but the blood on the body was still wet. Byakuya said not to touch it to avoid getting all bloody... But for how much blood there was on the body...I didn't see any on the ground around it.

   : Because just after nighttime began, I came to the garden. I was going around looking for everyone, so I could tell them about Monokuma. Hiro's been spending most of his time in the garden the last few days, so I figured he'd be here. And I can confirm that when I arrived last night,
   <b>
    there was no body here
   </b>
   .
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-Byakuya8.png"/>
   : So the murder could only have taken place
   <b>
    at some point during nighttime
   </b>
   , *after* I left the garden!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Byakuya7.png"/>
   : However...Toko, Hiro, Hina, and I were in the gym together the entire night last night.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : What...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Byakuya.png"/>
   : Once I found Hiro in the garden, we immediately went to Toko and Hina's rooms to get them. At that point, we all went to the gym and began dismantling Monokuma. As a precaution, we made sure not to go anywhere alone. We even went to the bathroom in pairs. In other words, all four of us have
   <b>
    air-tight alibis
   </b>
   . The only ones who *don't* have alibis...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : ...are me and Kyoko.
   <br/>

   : ...then I'm the only one without an alibi...!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Byakuya.png"/>
   : Also, when we went to go get Hina and Toko, we stopped by your room, as well.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Byakuya2.png"/>
   : But you never came to the door. So...where, precisely, were you?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : I'm telling the truth, I was in my room. But I was dead asleep. I had a fever, so...

   <i>
    I should look back at what I did this morning, to help me remember when that was... Monokuma's announcement woke me up at
    <b>
     7 o'clock
    </b>
    as usual, and I headed for the dining hall pretty soon. Once I got there, I met up with Hina. That was right around
    <b>
     7:30
    </b>
    . Then I headed to the gym, where everyone else was waiting. Next, Toko went to go get the pickaxe. And that's when she found the body... What time was it then...?

I know I still have yet to do the ones from Chapter 3's deaths but Hifumi, Taka and Celeste basically have unstarted FTEs. That's a lot of extra material to cover and all three of them have at least four events in their FTE chain. I'll try to get through at least one of them during Chapter 5.

   : Well, I can't say I'm a huge fan of modern training techniques, which rely mainly on machinery. That's good for building muscle mass, but that doesn't necessarily translate to actual strength. More muscle is better, of course, but you also need to know how to use it. And if you're not used to it, pushing your muscles too hard can lead to injury. There are even some world-class wrestlers who only build muscle by climbing ropes and things like that.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Sakura3.png"/>
   : In mixed martial arts, speed, agility, and endurance are all necessary parts of total body coordination. If that's your goal, you can't just focus on one aspect of your training. For example, kipping pull-ups can train one area, while power training equipment works multiple areas.

    <br/>
    Sakura's room is...pretty much exactly how I would've imagined it. But hanging out in a girl's room, just us... Gettin' kinda nervous! And it being Sakura makes me nervous for a whole other reason...

   <b>
    love
   </b>
   ?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Sakura4.png"/>
   : And being shy about saying it is even more girly, right? I creep myself out, to be honest...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Makoto.png"/>
   : But you *are* a girl. You're allowed to have a feminine side.

   : Gh...!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Makoto.png"/>
   : Huh? Are you okay?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Sakura6.png"/>
   : Y-Yes, I just... You made me remember something. Kenshiro once said something very similar... I'd forgotten about that...

   <br/>

   <br/>

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-043.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Sakura6.png"/>

   : ...Huh?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Sakura4.png"/>
   : When they found out, they said he only had six months to live. But six months has come and gone, and he's still fighting... That's just how he is. He would never let a disease beat him. He has to get better... He's the strongest human alive. I admit that--no, I *believe* that.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Makoto.png"/>
   : S-Sakura...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Sakura6.png"/>
   : I visited him once. He'd lost so much weight. He looked like an entirely different person. But do you know what he said? He told me that now
   <b>
    I was the strongest human alive
   </b>
   . That I had taken the title. He said he'd return someday to get the title back. He said I'd better not let anyone else take it.

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Sakura.png"/>
   : He didn't need to say that last part. I'll never give up that title, not until he gets better. And when that day comes...I will
   <b>
    defeat Kenshiro
   </b>
   and earn that title for real. And that's why I have to get stronger...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Makoto.png"/>
   : I had no idea...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Sakura4.png"/>
   : That's my biggest reason for becoming the strongest human alive. I'm sorry for wasting your time with such a longwinded story...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Sakura6.png"/>
   : I'm...not even sure why I told you. I think that somehow...you remind me of him.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Makoto.png"/>
   : Huh? Me?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Sakura.png"/>
   : Well, in certain ways. Your build is obviously different, but you both have a
   <b>
    strong core

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Makoto.png"/>
   : Strong core...? N-No, I...

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Sakura8.png"/>
   : You don't have to be modest. I know strength when I see it. Okay?

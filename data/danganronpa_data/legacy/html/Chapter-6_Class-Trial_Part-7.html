   : Oh, did you think I was being serious? Sorry, I was just messing with you. It's been so long since I've had an audience, even I'm not sure what kind of role I'm supposed to play.

   : Anyway, looks like I've finally been set free. Having to play Monokuma all the time, day after day... It was like I was stuck in purgatory, or like a slow suicide. I get bored so easy, ya know?

   : Huh? What about my face? What's wrong with my beautiful face? People have told me I'm cuter than a hundred chihuahuas combined.

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Junko12.png"/>
   : Wow, you have a pretty good memory. I guess that's why you've made it this far, huh?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Makoto31.png"/>
   : So I was right... Then what you told me in the main hall when this all began...

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-0648.png"/>

   I've seen her on tons of magazine covers, but...[/i]
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Makoto.png"/>
   : I feel like that doesn't quite match up to reality.

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Junko6.png"/>
   : Ahaha, well of course! Those are totally photoshopped.

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Makoto.png"/>

   : Sometimes a little lie is necessary to keep things moving along, wouldn't you agree?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Byakuya.png"/>
   : That explains why she didn't quite seem the same. Because she was a different person all along...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Junko12.png"/>
   : I'm me, and Mukuro is Mukuro. She tried her best, but there's just no way she could have passed as the Ultimate Fashionista. Two people can never become one as long as the walls of mind and body exist... Not even if they're twins.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Toko7.png"/>
   : T-Twins!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Junko12.png"/>
   : I know, it's such a cliche, right? I'm almost embarrassed to admit it. So basically, Mukuro and I had your stereotypical "twin" relationship... The older sister, tough and proud--that was Mukuro. The younger sister, smart and cute--that was...

   : Hyaaaahaha! Me! Junko fucking Enoshima! And together, we were the Despair Sisters! AKA the
   <b>
    Ultimate Despair
   </b>
   !
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Hiro7.png"/>
   : Whoa, she's a totally different person now!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Junko13.png"/>
   : Like I said, I get bored easy as hell! I even get fuckin' bored with myself!

   <br/>

   : B-But if you're twins, why do you have d-different last names?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Junko13.png"/>
   : Ugh, that again? You have any idea how many times people ask me that shit? Maybe it's new to your dumb ass, but it bores me to tears! Answering the same questions, over and over! Just make up whatever answer you want, I don't give a shit! The truth's fuckin' lame, anyway.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Hina10.png"/>
   : But...if she was your twin, that means...you killed your own sister?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Junko13.png"/>
   : And for reasons deeper and darker than the ocean! ...Hah! As if!

   : Well, I suppose I'd better explain... For my plan to work, someone had to be able to control the killing game from behind the scenes.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-0667.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Junko14.png"/>
   : The so-called mastermind had to operate Monokuma, keep an eye on everyone, things like that. But after looking at the situation, I determined it would be impossible for Mukuro to perform such duties. Because naturally, she turned out to be the letdown of the family. Leaving me behind to run off and join some band of mercenaries... Such a disappointment.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Junko14.png"/>
   : So, I decided to play the role of director and have her join the rest of you in your school life. I could have let her work alongside me, but she would have been useless to me that way. Besides,
   <b>
    15 students
   </b>
   seemed like a solid number to start with. Of course, the fact that she was the
   <b>
    Ultimate Soldier
   </b>
   posed something of a problem.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Junko14.png"/>
   : She had what I call the "three atrocities"--atrociously rank, atrociously filthy, atrociously repulsive. It was atrociously clear just how out of touch she was with the rest of society. Meanwhile, my "
   <b>
    Ultimate Fashionista
   </b>
   " status has an undeniable appeal that I didn't want to go to waste.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-0671.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Kyoko7.png"/>
   : And that's...why you switched identities?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Junko14.png"/>
   : Sadly, her inability to match my personality was even greater than I'd calculated. It was a lost cause... She was nothing more than a bit player, an extra unworthy of lines. Being the utter disappointment that she was, anyone would have expected her to get killed off right away. Which is precisely why I killed her--to meet everyone's expectations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-0674.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Makoto33.png"/>
   : That... can't be your only reason, can it?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Junko14.png"/>
   : Well no, of course not. I also did it to avoid becoming bored.
   <br/>
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Junko15.png"/>
   : I've never been a stickler for following a plan to the letter, ya know? If I planned everything out and knew just what was gonna happen, that'd be sooo boooring! So, I changed things just a bit, and decided to use Mukuro to
   <b>
    make a little point
   </b>
   !
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Kyoko7.png"/>
   : In other words, Mukuro's death was a one-sided, premeditated act of
   <b>
    betrayal
   </b>
   .
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : Just as I suspected... When Mukuro was killed, she must have been as surprised as anybody else.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-FlashT.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-0679.png"/>

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-0680.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Junko15.png"/>
   : Eh-heh! So you figured it out? Well you're right! There's no way Mukuro could have pulled off such a convincing performance! But she did teach you all a very valuable lesson, don't you think?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Makoto31.png"/>
   : ...How can you talk like that...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Makoto22.png"/>
   : You sacrificed your own sister... How does that not even bother you!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Junko15.png"/>
   : What? I sacrificed her? That's what's got you so hot under the collar? Jeez, misunderstandings sure are scary!
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Junko15.png"/>
   : We were the Ultimate Despair, ya know? So we never had any kind of hope, or expectations. No, I've felt despair as long as I can remember, like I never should have been born at all. When I was born, I cried tears of total despair. So that's why for us, it's not a big deal whether we die or kill! We're just those kinds of people. We can do anything! We've always been filled with despair, so when we do something, we go all the way and live without regret!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Hina10.png"/>
   : So you just murdered your own sister, and didn't think anything of it...?

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Hina12.png"/>
   : ...Huh?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-Junko16.png"/>
   : Killing my precious sister with my own two hands... That act is filled with so much despair, you can't help but put a "super" in front of it. It's like super super super super super despair. No, more than that... Super super super super super super super super super super super super super super super despair... It just feels...so...good...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Hiro8.png"/>
   : What the hell is wrong with you...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-Junko16.png"/>
   : And my sister, too... In that moment of death, I think she must have felt that despair. After all, to be murdered by your own sister, and only as an example to someone else...? She must have died feeling such excruciating hopelessness... I'm so...jealous of her. Super jealous...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-0699.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Byakuya4.png"/>
   : I knew you couldn't be just some ordinary person. You're some kind of...abnormality.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Kyoko2.png"/>
   : Turning your own despair into some kind of fetish... Abnormality doesn't even begin to describe it.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Hiro7.png"/>
   : Like, Genocide Jill is crazy for sure, but...this is a whole nother level of nuts!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-Junko16.png"/>
   : You're saying I don't compare to some lowly beast that can only kill the weak, right? So I'm hopelessly attractive? Hopelessly brilliant? Hopelessly athletic...? I'm the hopelessly perfect ultimate human?
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Toko13.png"/>
   : Yeah! Master's way more p-perfect! Cuz on top of everything else, he's got that n-noble blood!

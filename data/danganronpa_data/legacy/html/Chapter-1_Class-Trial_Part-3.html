   : Hmm... It certainly would seem that way.

   <br/>
   <br/>

   : But...why would she switch them in the first place?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : She wanted someone to come to the room she was in, and *also* hide the fact that it was Makoto's room.

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Kyoko.png"/>
   : To understand that...we first need to understand what happened after she invited the person into the room. That's where the answer lies...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Taka16.png"/>
   : What happened then was...probably... Whoever she invited over...came in, and...attacked her!
   <br/>

   <br/>

   : Sayaka fought with her killer there in the room, yes? Perhaps the answer to our previous question lies in that initial struggle.
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>

   : Oh yeah, what's the deal with that sword?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Makoto2.png"/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Makoto20.png"/>
   : It seems pretty likely that the killer used it to break Sayaka's right wrist.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Leon2.png"/>
   : How the hell could you possibly know that's what broke her wrist!?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    The reason I know Sayaka's wrist was broken with the fake sword is because... When you look at her wrist, there's no doubt.

   <br/>

   : That sword leaves gold dust everywhere and we saw a glitter of gold on her wrist. Put two and two together, and...

   : All you have to do is take a good look at her
   <b>
    broken wrist
   </b>
   , and it should become pretty clear. Right there where her wrist is all swollen, there's something glittery there, see?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-305.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Chihiro7.png"/>

   <b>
    gold

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Makoto2.png"/>
   : It sure is. Specifically, the gold coating from the replica sword. You barely have to touch that stuff and it'll stick right to you. And there's some on her wrist because...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Taka7.png"/>
   : I got it! Because she got hit with the sword, right there on her wrist!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Hifumi5.png"/>
   : I see, I see... And so the truth draws ever closer...

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Hiro15.png"/>
   : Alright! Then it's about time to solve this mystery!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    What happened in my room... And what led to Sayaka's death... That's what we need to make clear.

   : Are you getting used to these Nonstop Debates? Starting with the next debate, I'll start loading
   <b>
    multiple Truth Bullets
   </b>
   into your Truth Cylinder. But just like with the weak spots, only
   <b>
    one
   </b>
   of those bullets can actually refute the proper statement. In other words, from here on out... you'll have to
   <b>
    combine
   </b>
   the right Truth Bullets with the right weak spots to refute each statement. If you come up with the wrong combination, you'll take damage to your Influence Gauge. By the way, if the Logic Difficulty is set to Kind, fewer bullets will be loaded into the cylinder. For our purposes this time, the Logic Difficulty will be set to Mean.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Narration.png"/>
   : There is where the Nonstop Debates really become good. By giving the player multiple Truth Bullets, you have to stop and really think about what combination will break through a weak spot. There's usually one that obviously doesn't makes sense or fit but there's also usually one that comes very close or seems to match another weak point that isn't the right one.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Narration.png"/>
   : I started the game with the Logic Difficulty set to Kind but beginning next trial, I will have it set to Mean. Mean Logic gives the player more bullets and more weak spots to choose from. Kind and Gentle will give fewer and fewer even all the way until the end of the game. Hell, first time I played I played on Gentle and had no more than 1 bullet all the way into the last trial. I'm not repeating that.

   : So you're saying the sword was initially used to defend against an attack from the knife.

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-Taka9.png"/>
   : Then they took the knife and attacked Sayaka before she knew what was happening!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Taka7.png"/>
   : So she grabbed the sword to defend herself, but then the culprit took that from her, too...!

   : Because she never held the sword at all. There's a

    certain part of her body
   </b>
   that makes this clear.

    perfectly clean

   , so I don't think she ever picked up the sword...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-Hina2.png"/>
   : How can you know that just by looking at her palms?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-Makoto25.png"/>
   : Like I said before, the

   : In fact, if you look you'll notice that a lot of the gold has already come off the handle. It's safe to assume that's because whoever used the sword got some of it on their hands.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="95-Makoto30.png"/>

   : That would also explain why she would switch the nameplates. She wanted to get whoever she had targeted to come to Makoto's room, where she was staying... And by committing the murder there, instead of her room, that would implicate Makoto.

   : I don't know... I'm not sure out softhearted Makoto is capable of that kind of cutthroat behavior. I'm sure Sayaka realized the same thing, which is why out of all of us, she asked him to switch rooms.

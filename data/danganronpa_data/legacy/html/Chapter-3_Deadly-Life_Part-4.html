    There are hammers of all different sizes hanging on the wall. Although some are more like mallets... Mallets...? Could the Justice Hammers have been designed...using these as a model? Either way, all the hammers here have obviously seen a lot of use. They're all covered in debris and chalky stone powder...

    For some reason...this one hammer isn't dirty at all. And it's...wet. Did someone

    it recently...?

   <i>
    Taka... He'll never move again... According to the Monokuma File, Taka died from
    <b>
     a blow to the head
    </b>
    . We found
    <b>
     Justice Hammer 4
    </b>
    near his body in the equipment room. Is that what was used to kill him...? And there's a tarp laid out under his body... Did the killer use this to move Taka's body? That way, there wouldn't be any blood left behind while the body was moved...

    Hifumi's big, cold body is laying on the floor... His... *really* big body. I mean, how on Earth was the killer able to move someone so big? From
    <b>
     the nurse's office
    </b>
    where he was discovered to here, the
    <b>
     repository
    </b>
    ... All the way from the 1st floor to the 3rd... And all without anyone noticing it. How the hell...?

    It's no good. I just don't get it. I can think about it later. For now, I have to finish investigating Hifumi himself.

    <br/>
    If I remember correctly, Hifumi's fatal injury was also a blow to the head. Probably from Justice Hammer 3, which was laying on the floor in the nurse's office...

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Huh? Wait...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Something's...off about his body. Why am I getting this feeling...? Something's...different. Something about Hifumi's body in the nurse's office, versus his body right now...

    ...That's it! His glasses! When his body was in the nurse's office, his glasses were covered with blood. But now...they're completely clean. Does that mean...someone wiped his glasses off? But who would do that? And why?

    It's a dolly. It doesn't have a handle... I saw this in the art room before. I guess it's used to move statues around. It's kinda awkward, but if you bend down, it's not too hard to use. Huh? But wait...
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-FlashT.png"/>

     blood

    on the wheel of the dolly that was moved from the
    <b>
     equipment room
    </b>
    to the

     repository
    </b>
    ... What's the explanation for that...?

   : Let's see what Byakuya has to say about the murders. He was sounding pretty disappointed earlier.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-067.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Byakuya... Do you think Hiro really did it?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Byakuya.png"/>
   : I don't see how anyone could think otherwise. When the attacks and murders and disappearances all happened, every one of us had an alibi. And the last thing Hifumi said when he died...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Yeah...he said
   <b>
    Hiro's
   </b>
   name.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Byakuya.png"/>
   : Then there is no room to suspect anyone else.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Okay, but if he did do it... Why would he hide his identity with
   <b>
    that weird costume
   </b>
   ?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-068.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Byakuya15.png"/>
   : Maybe he thought that no matter what happened, he'd be safe as long as his face was covered. Because he's the fool of the century, you see.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    I mean, he *is* kinda dumb... But do you really think that's enough to explain it? I feel like there's a clue hiding in there somewhere...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Byakuya2.png"/>
   : And is that it? That's all that bothers you about the case?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Well, no... There are a few other things. Like, why did the killer try to hide the bodies?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-070.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Byakuya3.png"/>
   : They probably figured that if we couldn't find the bodies, we couldn't complete out investigation.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : But if that's the case, we found the bodies pretty easily, didn't we?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Byakuya.png"/>
   : Again, it comes back to the fact that the culprit was a moron.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Is that really all there is to it...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Byakuya.png"/>
   : ...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : The other thing that bothers me is...why'd they bother killing
   <b>
    two people
   </b>
   ?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-071.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Byakuya12.png"/>
   : ...What?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Because all the rule says is,
   <b>
    if you can kill someone and get away with it
   </b>
   , you graduate. Right? So if you're the killer, your number one priority is not getting caught. But killing two people means more clues, more chances you'll get found out.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Byakuya10.png"/>
   : Hold on. Perhaps... I see... So that's what that means.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : I-Is everything okay...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Byakuya9.png"/>
   : ...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-073.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Byakuya7.png"/>
   : Don't talk to me as if we're friends.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Huh? What's with the attitude?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Byakuya3.png"/>
   : But...you have my appreciation.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Byakuya14.png"/>
   : Thanks to you, I might have some fun with this after all. *leaves*

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    His mysterious words hung in the air as he left the repository.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : He talked as if...he'd figured something out. But if he did, would it have killed him to tell me what it was?

   <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Narration.png"/>
   : Let's check in with Hina. She was pretty shaken up by all of this.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-076.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Hina9.png"/>
   : Hey, um...Makoto? I've been thinking about something. It's about the repository...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Huh? What is it?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Hina20.png"/>
   : After Hifumi and Taka's bodies disappeared, we split up to look around, right? I was really scared, so me and Sakura stuck together. And we came right to the repository to, y'know, look around.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Hina2.png"/>
   : But when we got here,
   <b>
    the repository was locked
   </b>
   . We couldn't get inside...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : It was locked...?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-077.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Hina20.png"/>
   : And we came here as soon as the search started, so there's no way someone coulda beat us here... So if that's true, then...who locked it? And why is it unlocked now?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : I wonder the same thing...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    The door was locked when the search for the bodies began, but now it's wide open... There might be some secret lurking in there... But I'll probably have to leave this area to figure it out...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Narration.png"/>
   : We've examined everything and talked with everyone in here so we can now examine the repository door before leaving the area.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-081.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    There's only one way in and out of this room... Through the door that Hina said was locked before. There's definitely a lock on the door, but it can only be locked from inside the repository.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-082.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I don't see any way to lock it from in the art room...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Hmm...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    The door can only be locked from inside the repository. Which makes me wonder... Hina and Sakura confirmed that the door was locked after we started looking for the missing bodies. And the door is designed so that it can only be locked from inside the repository. In other words... When Hina checked it, someone had already gone in the repository and locked the door. When they were done, they unlocked it and left. Which is why it's unlocked now... But Hina claims that there's no way someone could have beaten them to the repository... So that certain someone...

   : Hmm... There's gotta be a clue around here somewhere.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Maybe I should check somewhere else. There are some places I already know about... First the
    <b>
     nurse's office
    </b>
    , where Hifumi was found. Then the
    <b>
     equipment room
    </b>
    , where Taka was found...

    Justice Hammer 4... The weapon that was used to kill Taka... The body was moved, but the murder weapon was just left here...

    There's some kind of tire mark going through the pool of blood in the middle of the room. That reminds me... About the dolly in the repository...

    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-094.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>

   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Which could mean that Taka's body was moved from the equipment room to the repository using the dolly...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Both rooms are on the 3rd floor, so that should definitely have been possible.

    But even if the dolly *was* used to move Taka's body...what about Hifumi? Hifumi's body was in the nurse's office on the 1st floor. Even with a dolly, there's no way to get it up to the 3rd floor...

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-Celeste5.png"/>
   : Correct. Hina was not feeling well, so I stayed behind to look after her. But she seemed to be getting worse, so I took her to the bathroom.

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Kyoko3.png"/>
   : But before you do, let me just say one thing.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kyoko13.png"/>
   : If you execute Makoto, that means you lose. Not that that matters to you, right?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Monokuma11.png"/>
   : Huh? I...lose?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Monokuma6.png"/>
   : You! Explain yourself! What do you mean by that!?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-044.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : Well you set up this latest class trial yourself, right? I was getting in your way, so you wanted an excuse to kill me.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kyoko13.png"/>
   : I was supposed to be chosen as the blackened and then executed, right?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Monokuma2.png"/>
   : H-Hey, what are you talking about?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Kyoko15.png"/>
   : But when Makoto chose to overlook my lie, your plan came crashing down. The results of the trial weren't at all what you were expecting. Because you never imagined that in that position, one person would protect another like that.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : And in response to that unexpected development...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-042.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kyoko13.png"/>
   : ...you reacted by proclaiming *Makoto* the blackened and trying to execute *him*. You made that choice out of desperation. No, more than that... You must have realized that Makoto, who refused to be manipulated, was a threat to you, as well.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Monokuma.png"/>
   : ...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : But then there was *another* unexpected development waiting for you. An entity that would throw a wrench, so to speak, in your precious execution machinery.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Alter Ego...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Kyoko15.png"/>
   : You never imagined the possibility of a being that could come to our aid even after you'd "killed" it.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-048.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Kyoko16.png"/>
   : Now, here's the absolute truth. Makoto didn't kill Mukuro. You did.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Monokuma.png"/>
   : ...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Kyoko14.png"/>
   : So executing Makoto for it would surely be a violation of your rules, which I know you love so much. If the blackened is exposed, they alone will be executed. That's what you told us, right?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-047.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Monokuma.png"/>
   : Hmph. And that means I lose? You talk a big game. You're saying the blackened is me and not Makoto?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Monokuma11.png"/>
   : And you can prove this, right?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Kyoko2.png"/>
   : No, I can't.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Don't just say it like that!
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-036.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Monokuma2.png"/>
   : What is this, a comedy routine? To make such bold claims without a shred of evidence...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Kyoko2.png"/>
   : I don't have any right now, but with a little more time I guarantee I'll find some.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kyoko13.png"/>
   : Because no matter how deeply you try to bury it, there is only ever one absolute truth.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Monokuma2.png"/>
   : And now you're trying to talk like some kind of famous detective type?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-046.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : If Makoto really was the killer, he never would have come to you willingly like this. He would have feared for his life, feared another execution. He would have tried to run and hide. He would have been gripped by the despair you so love to inspire.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Kyoko.png"/>
   : But here we are--confronting you with nothing but hope in our hearts.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Monokuma2.png"/>
   : And that's supposed to be enough to convince me in the absence of evidence?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : It's not you I'm trying to convince.

   : Of course, you can say we're just making this all up. You're welcome to prove us wrong. No, you have no choice *but* to prove it. Because if you kill Makoto without proving your own innocence, you'll be accepting your own defeat.
   <br/>

   : Gh-grg-grah!

    Monokuma's unstable laughter seemed to cling to us as we walked away. And just like that, we were out of the gym.

   : Don't thank me just yet. The real battle is still ahead of us.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Yeah, true...
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Kyoko5.png"/>
   : But still, I'm glad it worked out. I wasn't sure it the enemy would accept my proposal.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Makoto2.png"/>
   : B-But honestly, why would the mastermind agree to that? I mean, they don't stand to gain anything from a final showdown, do they?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Kyoko2.png"/>
   : They had no choice but to accept.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Huh...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Kyoko.png"/>
   : It's all because of that one moment that the mastermind
   <b>
    [let down their guard]
   </b>
   , like I said.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <b>
    &gt; let down their guard
   </b>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Makoto2.png"/>
   : So when was it that the mastermind let their guard down...?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-061.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kyoko13.png"/>
   : I wasn't there to hear it myself, but do you remember what the mastermind said? They said they had
   <b>
    hijacked the airwaves to broadcast our school life to the outside world
   </b>
   , right?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Y-Yeah, they definitely said that...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Kyoko12.png"/>
   : And what did you think when you heard that? Pretty hard to believe, right?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Well...I mean, the idea of actually taking over the airwaves seems so...unbelievable.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : You don't exactly read about something like that happening very often, so it's hard to imagine. In other words, that kind of thing is extremely difficult to pull off.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kyoko13.png"/>
   : And yet somehow...the mastermind was able to do it.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-062.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Kyoko14.png"/>
   : But think of it another way--there must have been some reason they *had* to do something that difficult.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Makoto2.png"/>
   : A reason...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kyoko13.png"/>
   : They had to show the world something, no matter the cost--us killing each other.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Makoto2.png"/>
   : They wanted to show the world...?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-056.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : The mastermind has been very adamant about not killing us directly, but
   <b>
    forcing us to kill each other
   </b>
   . And all their rules and regulation were designed to encourage that.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Yeah, that makes sense. If those stupid regulations didn't exist, nobody would've killed anybody...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kyoko13.png"/>
   : So the mastermind's ultimate goal was to make us kill each other, and show that off to the world.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Makoto2.png"/>
   : But...why?
   <br/>
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : To prove a point, most likely.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Prove...a point?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Kyoko.png"/>
   : The outside world has a name for the students of Hope's Peak, right? A certain concept...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Makoto2.png"/>
   : You're talking about "hope," right?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : And for those of us who represent
   <b>
    hope
   </b>
   to kill each other and sink into
   <b>
    despair
   </b>

   : The mastermind wants the world to see that, to try and prove that
   <b>
    despair
   </b>
   is better than
   <b>
    hope
   </b>
   . That's their goal, as the Ultimate Despair.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Makoto2.png"/>
   : ...What?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    They want to prove that despair...is better than hope?
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Makoto2.png"/>
   : But that...that's ridiculous!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : You're right. It *is* ridiculous, completely irrational. It's the kind of thing that nobody but those who call themselves the Ultimate Despair would devise. That group whose only purpose and motivation comes from despair...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Makoto2.png"/>
   : B-But--! Is that really their only reason for making the rest of us suffer!?
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Kyoko7.png"/>
   : I know how angry it must make you. And yet...that same motivation is what led to the mastermind revealing their weakness.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Makoto2.png"/>
   : What...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kyoko13.png"/>
   : Because their goal is to broadcast this killing game to the world...the mastermind has had to be more particular than is reasonable about their own regulations. If the mastermind simply ignored their rules, this wouldn't have been a "game," but a one-sided slaughter.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Kyoko14.png"/>
   : At least, that's how
   <b>
    those who are watching this
   </b>
   would have seen it.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Makoto2.png"/>
   : And that's why the mastermind couldn't kill any of us themselves?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kyoko13.png"/>
   : That is precisely the reason. No matter how much they may hate what I'm doing, I haven't violated a single one of their regulations.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-FlashT.png"/>

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kyoko13.png"/>
   : Junko broke the rules, so she was punished. But in my case, they couldn't lay a finger on me. So instead, they tried to use the class trial, following all their proper rules, to get me killed. They began a trial that didn't have a right answer, then made me out to be the killer.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Makoto2.png"/>
   : But even that didn't work...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-058.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Kyoko2.png"/>
   : Yes, thanks to you. And due to that failure, the mastermind took yet another risk.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Makoto2.png"/>
   : And when that fact was exposed on live TV to the entire outside world...the mastermind had to accept your suggestion?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : To prove to the world that despair is better than hope, they have to defeat us in perfect form...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kyoko13.png"/>
   : It would only do the mastermind harm to have it shown that they'd violated their own regulations.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Makoto2.png"/>
   : But all of that was a hunch, right? And you were still able to get the mastermind to accept your challenge...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kyoko13.png"/>
   : Well, it's only thanks to you that we got that chance. Because you believed in me, another path opened up.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Still, I can't believe how much of the mastermind's thoughts and plans you were able to figure out. I didn't have the slightest clue...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-066.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Kyoko3.png"/>
   : In the end, though, I couldn't prove any of it. It was just my reasoning. Essentially, I was making a bet.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : But it looks like I got it right. This time, at least, I won the bet.
   <br/>
   <br/>

    She let out a quick sigh. I took it as a small sign of relief.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Kyoko5.png"/>
   : To be honest, I haven't been that nervous in a long time.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Makoto2.png"/>
   : I totally couldn't tell you were nervous at all... You seemed totally confident from the moment we decided to go talk to him.

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Kyoko15.png"/>
   : Well, presenting a strong demeanor is a fundamental part of negotiation and persuasion, wouldn't you say? Plus, if I'd showed my uneasiness, that would have just made you that much more uneasy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Yeah, you're probably right. How pathetic...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Kyoko.png"/>
   : Anyway, we can't relax just yet. All we've done is earn another chance to fight. We have to win this time.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : Or everything we've gone through will have been for nothing...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Makoto2.png"/>
   : You're right...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    If we can't defeat the mastermind, it'll cost us our lives...! There is no option except to win!

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Kyoko2.png"/>
   : But before we begin the final battle, we have to tell the others what's going on.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Makoto2.png"/>
   : True, but now we know who our real enemy is. All we have to do now is work together with everyone to destroy the mastermind...!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Kyoko2.png"/>
   : Work together with everyone...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Kyoko3.png"/>
   : Is that really possible?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Makoto2.png"/>
   : ...Huh?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Kyoko2.png"/>
   : Anyway, right now we have to go find the others. They're probably in the dorms somewhere. Shall we go?

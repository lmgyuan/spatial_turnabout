    The massive high school towers over all the other buildings in this bustling urban area. It's like the school stands at the center of the entire world.

    It brings in top students from every field imaginable. A government-funded school of privilege... They say that if you come here and manage to graduate, you'll be set for life. With hundreds of years of tradition, it sends the cream of the crop into the work force every year. It was built to raise
    <b>
     hope
    </b>
    in the nation's future. Which makes
    <b>
     Hope's Peak

    a pretty fitting name.

    There are two things you need to attend this school... One, you have to already be attending high school. Two, you have to be the very best at what you do. No ordinary student could enroll here.  The only way in is if you're scouted by the school itself.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And standing there at the gate of the ultimate school filled with the ultimate students...

    My sleep was deep and uninterrupted. That was my only way to preserve what little strength I had left, after not being able to eat or drink. I can't be sure, but I think at least a full day had to have passed. And all I did was sleep and sleep...

   : Well here's one thing we do know... The first time we found Hifumi's body was in the nurse's office. And then, while me and Celeste were in the bathroom his
   <b>
    body disappeared
   </b>
   !
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Byakuya.png"/>
   : And the next time we saw his body it was in the repository.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Celeste7.png"/>
   : But when you compare his body before being moved, and his body after being moved... Other than the change in
   <b>
    how it was positioned
   </b>
   , there
   <b>
    was no notable difference
   </b>
   .
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Sakura4.png"/>
   : Then...was he really still alive?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Celeste16.png"/>
   : Of course not, it is impossible. This is ridiculous...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    The reason I can say Hifumi was still alive... If I can just find the contradiction in these statements, I'm sure it'll become clear...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Narration.png"/>
   : Early in the investigation we discovered that Hifumi's glasses had been wiped clean. Why would that be?

   between Hifumi in the nurse's office and the repository...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Makoto28.png"/>
   : His

    glasses

   . That fact alone proves that he was only playing dead in the beginning.

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Makoto23.png"/>
   : It was a
   <b>
    glasses cleaning cloth
   </b>
   featuring a certain cartoon mascot! One look at the
   <b>
    bloodstain
   </b>
   on the cloth should make things clear. This piece of cloth was used to wipe Hifumi's glasses clean.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-297.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Makoto25.png"/>
   : And the mascot on the cloth is the same one that's on the digital camera, right?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Makoto29.png"/>
   : And whose digital camera was it? Hifumi's, of course...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Hina2.png"/>
   : The character was...Princess Piggles, from "Demon Angel☆Pretty Pudgy Princess" I think...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Makoto2.png"/>
   : I highly doubt anyone but Hifumi would have brought something like this to school...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Sakura.png"/>
   : I see your point. And the only people here who wear glasses are...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-300.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Byakuya15.png"/>
   : I wouldn't be caught dead using a tacky piece of garbage like that.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Jill9.png"/>
   : A few tissues is all I need to keep my glasses clean!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Makoto25.png"/>
   : Then there's no question--it belonged to Hifumi.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-303.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Hiro12.png"/>
   : Mm, mm... So what you're saying is...what exactly?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Makoto25.png"/>
   : What I'm saying is, the blood on his glasses was wiped away using his own glasses cleaning cloth.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Celeste9.png"/>
   : Even if that is true, it does not mean he wiped the blood off himself.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Makoto28.png"/>
   : But who would benefit from a clean pair of glasses, other than the glasses' owner?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-307.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Sakura3.png"/>
   : That's a good point...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Hiro4.png"/>
   : Then it must've been him...right?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : So let's assume that Hifumi was still alive in the nurse's office. He pretends to be dead, then when he's alone, he wipes his glasses clean so he can see... Then he stands up and walks out on his own two feet.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Kyoko13.png"/>
   : And with that, the impossible task of moving his copious corpse...becomes possible, wouldn't you say?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Hina9.png"/>
   : But then, if he was just pretending to be dead...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-FlashT.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-312.png"/>

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-FlashB.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Hina9.png"/>
   : ...what was with all that blood? Was it paint or somethin'?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-313.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Kyoko12.png"/>
   : The fridge in the nurse's office contains packs of blood for emergencies. He probably used one of those.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Jill2.png"/>
   : He figured if he was gonna play dead, he should go all-out! So he just dumped it everywhere!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Jill7.png"/>
   : But he got crazy with it, and had to wipe his glasses off when he was done! God, what an idiot!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : And if Hifumi was still alive at that point, the disappearance of Taka's body is easily explained.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Kyoko13.png"/>
   : It should be perfectly obvious who must have moved Taka's corpse...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    The one who moved Taka's body was...

   <b>
    Hifumi

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Byakuya9.png"/>
   : While we were all gathered in the nurse's office, he went to the equipment room and took Taka's body...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Makoto25.png"/>
   : That also explains how the door to the repository got locked.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Jill5.png"/>
   : The door was locked?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Hina9.png"/>
   : Well, after the bodies disappeared, we all went looking for them, right? So me and Sakura headed for the repository. But when we got there, the door was locked!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Makoto25.png"/>
   : And the repository door can only be locked from the inside. Which means, when Hina and Sakura got to the repository, someone was already inside.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Byakuya9.png"/>
   : And it could only have been Hifumi, who'd just finished stashing Taka's body there.

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Kyoko13.png"/>
   : He convinced us all he was dead, and when he saw his chance, he dragged Taka's body to the repository. So, Hifumi wasn't just another victim in this case--he was one of the
   <b>
    assailants
   </b>
   .
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-Sakura5.png"/>
   : B-But...that means he took part in the murders...!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Hina10.png"/>
   : I...I just can't believe it...

   <br/>

   : Th-There's more!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Kyoko15.png"/>
   : Oh, absolutely. The single biggest fact pointing to his involvement has yet to be revealed. You know what I'm talking about, right Makoto? The
   <b>
    item
   </b>
   he took off Taka's lifeless body?
   <br/>

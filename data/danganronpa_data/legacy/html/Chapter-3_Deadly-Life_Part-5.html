   : Phew! Man, I have have had the WORST day!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Makoto2.png"/>
   : ... Hiro...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Kyoko2.png"/>
   : I found Hiro. He was jammed into the pool room locker. It looked like he was fast asleep, so I kicked him and woke him up.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Hiro17.png"/>
   : I still can't believe you kicked me! You coulda been a little more gentle about it. Like, I dunno, caress my face or somethin'!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-142.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Kyoko7.png"/>
   : ...That's creepy.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Anyway... Kyoko, where have you been all this time? You just disappeared all of a sudden, without a trace...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Kyoko2.png"/>
   : There was something I had to check up on.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Makoto2.png"/>
   : What do you mean...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Kyoko2.png"/>
   : Never mind.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Makoto2.png"/>
   : I *can't* never mind...!

   <br/>

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Kyoko14.png"/>
   : Never. Mind. More importantly...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    She says that, but...does she have any idea? Does she know people think she might be spying for the mastermind?
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Kyoko12.png"/>
   : First of all...Hiro, you need to explain to us why you're dressed like that.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-141.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Hiro17.png"/>
   : Oh, uh, well...I mean... I have no idea. One second I was asleep, don't even know how that happened, then I woke up, and then I was here...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Byakuya2.png"/>
   : I don't care. Do something about that costume. It pains me just to look at you.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Hiro17.png"/>
   : Well, um... I dunno what's up with this thing, but I can't actually get it off...! A little help?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Celeste9.png"/>
   : Why would you make something that you can't take off by yourself?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Hiro17.png"/>
   : I didn't make the stupid friggin' thing!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Kyoko.png"/>
   : There's a clasp on the back that's keeping you from getting it off.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-148.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Kyoko.png"/>
   : It looks pretty sturdy. I don't think you can get it off on your own. We don't really have a choice. Let's help him.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    it took everyone's help, but slowly we were able to get Hiro out of the suit. It took a few minutes, but eventually we got all the pieces off.

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Hiro3.png"/>
   : Whew! Free at last!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Hina20.png"/>
   : Isn't it kinda weird how perfectly the suit fits Hiro...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Celeste2.png"/>
   : More to the point, nobody but Hiro would be able to wear that costume.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Hiro5.png"/>
   : Wait, what? H-Hold on a sec!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Celeste7.png"/>
   : Don't bother trying to act innocent. The blueprints were in your room, as well.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Celeste16.png"/>
   : In other words, it is obvious to everyone that you made this costume.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-156.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Byakuya.png"/>
   : That's true. I saw the blueprints myself.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Yeah...me too...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Hina12.png"/>
   : Then it's obvious... The one who put this costume on and went around attacking everyone was Hiro!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Celeste9.png"/>
   : Shall we tie him up and gag him?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Hina16.png"/>
   : Good idea! We wouldn't want him killing anyone else...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-160.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Hiro8.png"/>
   : T-Tie me up!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Makoto2.png"/>
   : H-Hold on, guys. I think that's going a little far...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Kyoko3.png"/>
   : He may be a suspect, but he deserves fair treatment.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Hiro5.png"/>
   : Yeah! I mean...attacking? Blueprints? I have no idea what you guys are talking about!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Hina16.png"/>
   : You can't talk your way out of this. It's been decided... You killed them!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-163.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Hiro10.png"/>
   : What? Killed who!? I have no idea what you're talking about! There must be a fake Hiro running around!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Hina15.png"/>
   : You're the only one who can wear this costume. So who else could possibly be the costumed attacker!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Hiro16.png"/>
   : How do you know I'm the only one!? Maybe you should try it on yourself before you convict me!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Hina22.png"/>
   : Fine! If you're gonna be a jerk about it, I will!
   <br/>
   <br/>

    Without missing a beat, Hina started putting on the Robo Justice costume.

   : Ahh! See, look! See how loose it is? I mean, come on... I'm blind as a bat in here! Can't see my feet at all. I'm surprised you got anywhere in this thing!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Hiro19.png"/>
   : I'm telling you, it wasn't me!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Hina27.png"/>
   : And not to mention--! You totally can't bend at the waist! Seems like a pretty obvious oversight...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Hiro19.png"/>
   : That's not a very nice thing to say!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Celeste18.png"/>
   : ...Hmm?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Hiro19.png"/>
   : Er, I mean--it's not like I made it! I just got caught up in the moment...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Hina27.png"/>
   : Well, either way...now we know for sure, right? I mean, it seems pretty clear that nobody but Hiro coulda fit into this dumb costume!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    In a huff, Hina took the suit back off again.

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Hiro5.png"/>
   : N-No, see...it's cuz you're a girl! If it was another guy, then...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Byakuya7.png"/>
   : Makoto, go ahead.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Makoto2.png"/>
   : O-Okay...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Against my will, I picked up the pieces off the floor and tried putting them on.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Makoto2.png"/>
   : It's no good... The arms are too long. There's no way I can wear this...
   <br/>

   : See!? I told you it was impossible!

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Celeste.png"/>
   : You are absolutely right. It seems this costume was made to fit Hiro's body exactly.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Hiro5.png"/>
   : Th-Then...there's another costume! They must have one that looks the same, but...but fits them!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Celeste15.png"/>
   : If you insist on this line of defense, then show us some evidence.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Hiro5.png"/>
   : Evidence...?

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Celeste9.png"/>
   : You claim there is another suit, yes? Then you must find it and show it to us.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Hiro6.png"/>
   : Wh-What the heck!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Hina16.png"/>
   : Who cares!? Hiro's the only one without an alibi during this whole thing anyway! Which is how we know it was him!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Hiro9.png"/>
   : I mean...is that really true? I have no idea what's been happening... Could someone, like...tell me?

   : U-Umm...if you don't tell me what's going on, how am I supposed to understand? I think I've figured out that...someone's been killed, right? Hey, Makoto...who was it?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Makoto2.png"/>
   : W-Well... Two people were killed. Taka and Hifumi...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Hiro8.png"/>
   : What!? TWO people!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Hina16.png"/>
   : Why are you freaking out? You did it.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Hiro10.png"/>
   : I did not!

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Kyoko.png"/>
   : You may as well tell us, then.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Hiro2.png"/>
   : Taka and Hifumi were fighting over Alter Ego, right?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-Hiro15.png"/>
   : Which means! Alter Ego and/or Chihiro must have done it!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Narration.png"/>
   : I love Hiro's accusation right there because the voice clip that plays during it says "I'm at least 30% right!" Oh, Hiro...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-140.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Kyoko2.png"/>
   : I see... That's unfortunate.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Hiro8.png"/>
   : Huh? Unfortunate...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Hina16.png"/>
   : Stop trying to trick us! Just admit that you did it, okay!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Hiro5.png"/>
   : I-I'm telling you, you got it all wrong!
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Note...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Hiro5.png"/>
   : Last night, someone slipped a
   <b>
    weird note
   </b>
   under my door. And here's what it said... "I found a hole maybe we can use to escape. Monokuma can't find out, so don't tell anyone else for now. Let's meet in the
   <b>
    rec room at 1 a.m.
   </b>
   "
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-Hiro13.png"/>
   : But the last thing I remember is going to the rec room, then for some reason I fell asleep... The real killer probably drugged me or something!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Hina16.png"/>
   : ...Not a chance.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : No, hold on. He could be onto something. The nurse's office did have chemicals that could do that...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Hina9.png"/>
   : Wh...Really?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-182.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-Hiro13.png"/>
   : I told you. Someone's trying to set me up... A secret passage--a chance to escape... Someone wrote all that to trick me!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Hina23.png"/>
   : Even if that's true, you must be one dumb fish to bit every piece of bait that floats in front of you.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Hiro5.png"/>
   : Well after being trapped here so long, even if you know it's a lie, you gotta check, right?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Hiro10.png"/>
   : Gyaho! They preyed on my desire to get out of here! They deceived me!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Hina23.png"/>
   : I still don't buy it...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Hiro16.png"/>
   : Well you SHOULD buy it!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Hina16.png"/>
   : Okay...then show us that note!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Hiro2.png"/>
   : With pleasure! I have it right here in my..um, pocket... ...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-188.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Hiro4.png"/>
   : Looks like I lost it...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Hina23.png"/>
   : Yeah, sure...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Hiro10.png"/>
   : P-P-Please, ya gotta believe me! I wouldn't hurt a fly!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Celeste4.png"/>
   : As I said before, if you want us to believe you, you must produce evidence. Can you show us the note? I have no particular issue with what you claim, but if you want us to believe you, give us a reason.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Hiro6.png"/>
   : Wh-What the heck!? For serious!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-190.png"/>

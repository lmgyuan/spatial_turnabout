: Hunh...?
*Ding dong*
The sharp sound of the doorbell pierced my sleepy haze and pulled me back to the real world.
*Rattle*

8-Kyoko7.png
: Makoto, get out here.
3-Makoto.png
: Kyoko...? What's going on?
8-Kyoko7.png
: Hina just came to see me, and she was white as a ghost. It sounds like something's happened.
3-Makoto.png
: What...?
As soon as I heard those words, my heart started to beat a little faster. I suddenly found myself wide awake.
8-Kyoko7.png
: She said for us to come to the
rec room
.
9-Makoto2.png
: The rec room...? Okay! Let's hurry!
13-Hina10.png
: Makoto! Kyoko!
9-Makoto2.png
: Hina, what's wrong!?
13-Hina10.png
: S-Something's not right... In the rec room...!
9-Makoto2.png
: What's inside?
There was a window on the rec room door, and I hurried to look inside. And when I did...
9-Makoto2.png
:
Sakura
...?
Is she...unconscious? She's sitting up in the chair, like she's...bowing her head.
8-Kyoko7.png
: What's going on? Did something happen to her?
13-Hina10.png
: I was just walking past, and I happened to notice her through the window... But I couldn't get the door open... I tried knocking, I tried calling her name... But she wouldn't respond...
17-Hina13.png
: S-So what should we do? What are we gonna do!?
8-Kyoko7.png
: First of all, we need to get into the room.
9-Makoto2.png
: But the door's locked, right? And if we break in, we'll be violating school regulations...
19-Kyoko14.png
: We're going to force our way in.
9-Makoto2.png
: I just said--!
20-Kyoko13.png
: The door isn't locked. It's not locked because
the rec room door doesn't *have* a lock
.
9-Makoto2.png
: Huh? Then why...?
21-Kyoko11.png
: It feels like the door is pressing against something inside the room. Is it...the chair?
9-Makoto2.png
: Chair...?
20-Kyoko13.png
: Either way, this door isn't locked. Which means, as far as I can tell, the rule doesn't apply.
9-Makoto2.png
: Then...there's no problem if we break in!?
8-Kyoko7.png
: Let's smash the window. That should be the fastest way...
13-Hina10.png
: Okay, I'll go get something to break it with! Wait right here!
Inside the rec room, Sakura still hadn't moved an inch... She's just unconscious...right?
9-Makoto2.png
: Is she...okay? I mean, it's Sakura, so I'm sure...
8-Kyoko7.png
: ...
Kyoko didn't reply. There was only silence... But that silence didn't last long.
13-Hina10.png
: Here!
13-Hina10.png
: *Huff huff* I found a broom! *Huff* In the classroom! *Huff huff* Use it!
8-Kyoko7.png
: You can handle this, right Makoto?
13-Hina10.png
: C'mon! Please, hurry!
9-Makoto2.png
: Okay! You two, stand back!
I took hold of the broom and swung as hard as I could. Aiming directly at the window, all it took was one solid hit...
*CRASH*
♪
Music cuts out.
♪
The window shattered into a hundred pieces, scattering across the rec room floor. I stuck my hand through the now open window and started jostling the chair.
9-Makoto2.png
: The chair's pretty heavy... But if I can just...!
I pushed on it with all my strength, and finally the knob turned.
9-Makoto2.png
: Sakura!
I ran up to her as fast as I could. But the moment I laid my hand on her...

...all I felt was cold
death
. I could feel only the last lingering warmth of a living body. Life had abandoned Sakura's body... And then...

: A body has been discovered! After a certain amount of time, which you may use however you like, the
class trial
will begin!

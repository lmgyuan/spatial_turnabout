: Good morning, everyone! It is now 7 a.m. and nighttime is officially over! Time to rise and shine! Get ready to greet another beee-yutiful day!

I'd better get to the dining hall...
10-Celeste2.png
: Taka and Kyoko are not here today...
11-Hiro.png
: Kyoko's still on guard duty, probably.
12-Sakura6.png
: I have no idea about Taka...
13-Hifumi12.png
: May as well just forget about that guy!
14-Hina9.png
: You don't have to get so mad...
15-Hiro4.png
: They're rivals in love. What're ya gonna do...?
17-Hifumi17.png
: Don't put me on the same level as that...that... virgin! I might catch his virginity!
18-Hiro14.png
: Nah, my guess is you're already infected...
19-Hina12.png
: Wait, can you really catch it!?
20-Celeste4.png
: Stop being vulgar. Let's eat breakfast.

Music fades out.

But as soon as my hands approached my food...
???: ...Kyeehaha!
19-Hina12.png
: Huh? That voice...
The doors to the dining hall exploded open, and a figure appeared...
23-MrMonokumaAfterClass.png
24-Jill7.png
: Kyeeehahaha!
25-Sakura3.png
: So it's you, Genocide Jack. And...
27-Byakuya5.png
: Don't bother asking why we arrived at the same time. The answer should be obvious.
28-Jill6.png
: I'll give you a hint... I'm wearing red lingerie today!
30-Hina10.png
: Umm...I don't think anyone wanted to know...
24-Jill7.png
: Hold on a second! You...!
19-Hina12.png
: H-Huh...!?
31-Jill9.png
: What's your top power level, like 35-22-33!? You start out big on top to try and look thinner down south!
33-Jill8.png
: Look at your melons! They're seriously gargantuan! Do you dunk 'em in milk every night or something!?
30-Hina10.png
: Y-You're starting to freak me out...!
34-Sakura11.png
: If you lay a finger on Hina...I will show you no mercy!
10-Celeste2.png
: So? What do you want? Surely you are not here to join us for breakfast.
36-Byakuya7.png
: Of course not. I came to hear a story.
37-Makoto.png
: A story...?
36-Byakuya7.png
: A story that nobody's bothered to tell me yet.
Are you talking about...Alter Ego?
39-Sakura4.png
: Sorry, but we can't talk about that right now.
40-Byakuya2.png
: Why not?
41-Sakura.png
: Because of certain...circumstances.
18-Hiro14.png
: Up till now you haven't given a crap about anything and *now* you're all concerned? I don't buy it.
43-Byakuya8.png
: I've just made a decision. When we get out of here, I'm going to feed your body to the vultures.
44-Hiro8.png
: What kind of messed up dictator are you!?
27-Byakuya5.png
: But isn't this a democracy? Or would you exclude those who don't fit into your tyrannical majority?
37-Makoto.png
: Th-That's not what we're doing...
46-Byakuya15.png
: Well, whatever. If nothing else, tell me what's going on with Taka. When I saw him yesterday, I happened to notice something seemed...off. So I was curious.
47-Celeste5.png
: Taka has become utterly useless.
48-Makoto2.png
: Celeste! You don't have to say it like that!
36-Byakuya7.png
: Did his spirit collapse or something? Was he unable to withstand this environment? Those men who clothe themselves in the cheap fabric of justice are often the first to fall...
50-Byakuya3.png
: But perhaps that will make things all the more interesting...
37-Makoto.png
: Interesting...?
27-Byakuya5.png
: Let me leave you with a bit of advice. Don't come to rely on false camaraderie or you'll reap its bitter reward.
52-Hina16.png
: That's why you came? To give us that amazing "advice"?
50-Byakuya3.png
: It seems I am unwelcome here. Then I will grant your desire and remove myself...
31-Jill9.png
: Yeah, let's get outta here!
53-Byakuya4.png
: ...You don't need to come with me.
55-Jill12.png
: You don't have to play hard to get, Master! You can just play hard!
56-Byakuya14.png
: That doesn't make any sense...
Byakuya started to slowly back out of the room... He started picking up speed, and soon he was sprinting out of the dining hall.
58-Jill5.png
: He ran away...? So now he's *running* hard to get... I see!
59-Jill3.png
: Wait wait wait wait! Gyaaahahahaha! *leaves*

Music fades out.

14-Hina9.png
: S-So at the end there... What was that all about?
61-Hiro5.png
: Just now, Byakuya was like...
62-Hifumi2.png
: Maybe he's like the mean guy who starts acting different or getting all flustered when things change!
63-Hiro2.png
: ...Guess so.
Those of us left in the dining hall finished our breakfast, then went back to our rooms.
66-BeautifulDays.png
37-Makoto.png
: Hmm... What to do today?
68-Narration.png
: Once again we have two more Free Times available.
68-Narration.png
: My original plan was to meet with Toko but there's one big catch when trying to do an FTE with her. Depending on what point you're at in the story, she might be herself or she might be Genocide Jill. Right now, she happens to be Jill.
68-Narration.png
: Now, Genocide Jill actually does have an FTE chain but well...I'm not actually sure how to activate it. I can talk to her, spend time with her and give her a present just like normal. The problem is that as soon as she finishes accepting the present the game kicks me straight back to Makoto's room with no FTE occurring. I think I read somewhere that you might have to do all of Toko's FTEs before you can do Jill's events. If that's the case, Jill's events will most likely be held until the end of the game because I'll have better access to her in School Mode.
68-Narration.png
: So since our resident novelist is unavailable, I figured we'd talk to our other creative student today. Hifumi can be found in the dining hall.
71-Hifumi.png
: Well, if it isn't Mr. Naegi! How can I help you today?
> Spend some time with Hifumi
74-Hifumi5.png
: So you want to be around me, eh? That means you must have realized that I have certain...powers.
17-Hifumi17.png
: Yes, that's right! My greatest power is my ability to negate the powers of others! I've never actually used it in a fight yet, but I'm not worried. Cuz whatever abilities they have...all I need is my power of negation!
Hifumi cornered me and made me take part in his delusion... Hifumi and I grew a little closer today.
> Yes, definitely
Demon Angel Princess Figure:
A collectible figure of Princess Piggles, the popular heroine from "Demon Angel Pretty Pudgy Princess."
78-Hifumi9.png
: I-I never imagined you'd want to give me something so rare, Mr. Naegi!
79-Hifumi20.png
: Super <3 God Level <3 Result <3
Seeing Hifumi so pleased with something I gave him makes me happy!
80-100MileJunkFoodDash.png
74-Hifumi5.png
: Mwehehe... I see quality in you, Mr. Naegi. True quality!
81-Hifumi3.png
: And that's why...I've decided to present to you my lecture on
the nature of fan fiction
! If we're going to be friends, you must be fully informed. I will permit no fanfic bigotry whatsoever!
37-Makoto.png
: I don't think I have any fanfic bigotry... I mean, I don't really know anything about that kind of geeky stuff anyway...
13-Hifumi12.png
: See, there it is! To you, fanfic equals geeky, right? But is that all that word is worth?
37-Makoto.png
: Huh? Did I say something wrong...?
84-Hifumi4.png
: But that's okay! Because I take the word geek as a compliment! For you see, there is nobody on Earth so full of knowledge as a geek!
81-Hifumi3.png
: In a sense, a geek is like an expert. That's right, a total expert! A successful musician must necessarily be a music geek, a good movie director is a movie geek. You see? It's those experts, those *geeks* who open up the world to others! So when you say that writing fanfic is "geeky"...
85-Hifumi14.png
: ...you're recognizing us as true experts!
37-Makoto.png
: Okay, so um...what exactly *is* fanfic, then?
86-Hifumi15.png
: Oof! Super direct question FTW!
71-Hifumi.png
: Basically, we have all different kinds of stores and events, right? These are where groups of holy warriors sell their own stuff based on games, comics, anime, everything.
37-Makoto.png
: And the stuff those people make...is fanfic?
74-Hifumi5.png
: Comics are the most common creation, but it also includes games, music, and even merchandise!
17-Hifumi17.png
: By the way, there's a name for when a group of fanfic creators come together. Specifically, it's any organized group that comes together to release their work.
A group that comes together to release their work...
> Circle
37-Makoto.png
: Is it...a circle?
90-Hifumi21.png
: It sure is! Of course you knew that. I mean, it's only common sense!
13-Hifumi12.png
: I certainly hope you don't expect me to explain such common-sense topics every time!
37-Makoto.png
: Well, like I said...I don't know too much about this stuff.
85-Hifumi14.png
: This goes well beyond "I don't know too much"!
81-Hifumi3.png
: But I guess I can't blame you. The propaganda never touches on that, so as a fanfic ambassador... By the time I'm done with you, you'll be itching to buy a premium pass to the next fanfic con!
79-Hifumi20.png
: Right!?
Obviously *he's* excited, but...
74-Hifumi5.png
: Gwehehe... That's it for today. I hope you're excited for your next lesson! I can't wait to see what the future has in store for the two of us...
I'm kinda scared to see what the future has in store for the two of us...
68-Narration.png
: This unlocks the skill
Handiwork
. It affects a mechanic in the Bullet Time Battles that we haven't seen yet. I'll explain it more later.
66-BeautifulDays.png
68-Narration.png
: This is the Dining Hall update, isn't it? Anyway, we're here to continue Sakura's events for our second Free Time.
41-Sakura.png
: Hello. Did you need something?
> Spend some time with Sakura
25-Sakura3.png
: I just got done exercising. Now would be a good time for a break. Would you like to get something to drink and talk for a bit?
Sakura and I sat down for tea and a calm, relaxing conversation... Sakura and I grew a little closer today.
> Yes, definitely
Asura's Tears:
A jewel treasured by an ancient super-race. "Even the devil has friends. You fool..." And then...tears flow.
99-Sakura2.png
: A-Are you sure I can have something so valuable...? Makoto, I...!
39-Sakura4.png
: ...
41-Sakura.png
: S-Since we've already talked so much, it's okay to talk a little more, right...?
Seeing Sakura so happy with something I gave her makes me happy!
25-Sakura3.png
: I suppose I don't mind talking with you a little more.
37-Makoto.png
: Really? Then...can I ask you something?
41-Sakura.png
: What is it?
37-Makoto.png
: It's about what we were talking about before. You said there's someone out there stronger than you?
12-Sakura6.png
: ...
37-Makoto.png
: Can I ask...is it a guy, or a girl?
101-Sakura7.png
: It's a
man
.
The man that Sakura has to surpass... Maybe she's talking about her own teacher...? Which would mean...
> Your dad
37-Makoto.png
: You were talking about...your dad?
104-DeathWishNoIntro.png
12-Sakura6.png
: ... The family dojo has been passed down from generation to generation for the past
three centuries
.
37-Makoto.png
: Three centuries...? That's one heck of a history...
41-Sakura.png
: I was born into my family as an only daughter. Male or female doesn't matter. It's my duty to protect our legacy. And because I am a woman, I must be even stronger than if I were a man.
99-Sakura2.png
: Some would say that a woman is incapable of becoming the strongest human alive. I want to prove them wrong. Which is why I subjected myself to such feverish training under my father's instruction. Surpassing my father was certainly important to me.
39-Sakura4.png
: But that was just a matter of time.
37-Makoto.png
: What do you mean...?
12-Sakura6.png
: I was 14 years old when I first beat my father in a sparring match. After that, I never lost to my father again.
37-Makoto.png
: Wait, then...!
41-Sakura.png
: Yes. I have already surpassed my father.
37-Makoto.png
: I don't believe it...
39-Sakura4.png
: I'm not sure I did the right thing. My father also had the desire to become the strongest human alive. But I can't look back. I can only move forward and try to claim that title for myself. That is
my destiny
.
106-Sakura12.png
: Well, that's all for now. That was enjoyable. Goodbye. *leaves*
Without another word, Sakura left me standing there alone. Wait, hold on...
37-Makoto.png
: I never did find out who could possibly be stronger than her...
Did she avoid talking about it on purpose...?
68-Narration.png
: This unlocks the skill
Breathing Technique
. It makes our Concentration Gauge (the Star meter) in trials recharge faster. Handy if you find yourself using concentration a lot, though it takes a good amount of SP to equip. I probably won't be needing it.
After we were done, I decided to head back to my room for a while...

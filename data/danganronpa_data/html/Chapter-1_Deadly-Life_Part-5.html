   : Well, I went to go get some tea from the kitchen last night, and all the knives were still there. But when I finished my tea and went back into the kitchen to wash my glass, one of the knives was gone.

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Hina9.png"/>
   : Well... she was killed in your room, right? So I mean... You guys were supposed to be friends, right? But you still... killed her... On the other hand, two people becoming good friends, then one killing the other is a classic drama setup. So when you consider everything together...

   : First, I went ahead and set my skills. We currently have 9 Skill Points and a couple skills. In general, Skills help your performance in the various minigames that the trial is composed of. Here's what I've set for this trial:
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <b>
    Cool and Composed:
   </b>
   Steadies your aim a little. Effective during the Nonstop Debate and the Hangman's Gambit. Costs 2 SP.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   -We got this from Byakuya. It's actually very handy because in the listed minigames, the cursor you control will move around automatically. This skill reduces how much the cursor moves on its own, making it easier to aim.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <b>
    Robot Jock:
   </b>
   Increases your Truth Bullet rate of fire. Effective during the Nonstop Debate and the Bullet Time Battle Final Strike. Costs 3 SP.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   -You'll see it in the next update, but when you do a Nonstop Debate you "fire" your truth bullets to punch holes in arguments. This skill reduces the time it takes for your bullet to reach the argument after it's fired. It's very useful as a quality of life skill, though definitely not essential. I went the whole game without it on my first playthrough and was fine.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <b>
    Melodious Voice:
   </b>
   Increases damage to the opponent when a statement is destroyed. Effective during the Bullet Time Battle. Costs 3 SP.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   -This skill is marginally useful in that it makes the Bullet Time Battle minigame go by faster since you do more damage during it. You can easily live without it if you're low on skill point availability but since we aren't, there's no reason NOT to equip it.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Narration.png"/>
   : This puts us at 8/9 Skill Points used. We can get more SP from Free Time events that don't give us skills. Take advantage of every Free Time you have because SP is limited and better skills cost more SP.

   : Next, we have the list of Truth Bullets from the e-Handbook. Here we can review exactly what each one says in preparation for the trial. Always be sure to review your Truth Bullets because they sometimes contain vital, specific information that helps you move the trial along. Here's the full list of Truth Bullets we have:

   <b>
    Taka's wristwatch
   </b>
   ! See? Look. It broke with the hands pointing
   <b>
    just past 6 o'clock
   </b>
   .
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : It must have gotten broken when he was attacked by the killer. Because as of last night...
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-194.png"/>

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Kiyondo3.png"/>
   : Hey! You! How long were you gonna keep us waiting!?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Taka's irritated voice pierced the air as he stared pointedly at his wristwatch.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Kiyondo3.png"/>
   : It's almost 10 o'clock, you know that!? Bedtime for all the little boys and girls!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Flashback.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-195.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : So if it wasn't broken after 6 last night, then he must have been attacked around
   <b>
    6 this morning
   </b>
   .
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Makoto28.png"/>
   : And that would be his official time of death.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Sakura3.png"/>
   : But if that's true, then he was killed well before Hifumi...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Makoto20.png"/>
   : And before Celeste was attacked this morning, which happened around 7.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Kyoko13.png"/>
   : That's right. Taka was killed
   <b>
    before
   </b>
   any of the other incidents took place.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Makoto20.png"/>
   : That simple fact slipped past all of us. We made the
   <b>
    wrong assumption
   </b>
   about the order of events all because of those Justice Hammers.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Byakuya3.png"/>
   : That's exactly why the culprit wrote the numbers on each hammer, and had them increase in size. That way, when we saw how they were used in each incident, we'd easily make that wrong assumption.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-202.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Kyoko.png"/>
   : Now, if Taka *was* killed around 6, then
   <b>
    everyone's alibis
   </b>
   for his murder go out the window. Because when he was killed, we hadn't met up in the dining hall yet.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Sakura4.png"/>
   : That may be true in the case of Taka's murder, but
   <b>
    all of our alibis still hold true
   </b>
   for Hifumi's death.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Hina20.png"/>
   : That's right... With him at least, we're all safe...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Flashback.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-205.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   ???: Ungyaaaaaahhh!!!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Huh!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Hina10.png"/>
   : Wh-What was that!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Celeste14.png"/>
   : That came from downstairs! It must have been...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Hifumi! He's in the nurse's office! This is bad! Come on, we have to go back!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Flashback.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-206.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Hina9.png"/>
   : When we heard Hifumi screaming, we were all together. Except for Hiro and Kyoko...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-FlashT.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-207.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-FlashB.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Hina9.png"/>
   : Then we all ran down to the nurse's office, and that's where we found his body...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-208.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Jill2.png"/>
   : That's totally true! We're all in the clear!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Hiro15.png"/>
   : Oh, I know! They must've recorded him screaming on a tape or something, then played it later on!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Hina20.png"/>
   : If that's true, where's the tape?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Hiro2.png"/>
   : I dunno.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Hina16.png"/>
   : Don't just go makin' stuff up!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-213.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Sakura7.png"/>
   : Anyway, we all have rock-solid alibis for when we heard Hifumi scream. Since all of us were there together, clearly none of us could have killed him.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Celeste8.png"/>
   :And it does not stop there. There was also the moment when we discovered the body had disappeared... When his body vanished from the nurse's office Hina and I were in the bathroom together, while everyone else was in the equipment room, correct?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Celeste17.png"/>
   : And then there's the disappearance of Taka's body from the equipment room... At that time, we were all gathered together in the nurse's office because of Hifumi going missing.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Jill2.png"/>
   : Well, don't forget, I was passed out in the equipment room the whole time!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-218.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Hiro15.png"/>
   : Wait, then what if Genocide Jill did it!? She could've dragged Taka's body out of there right then!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Byakuya.png"/>
   : Even if she could pull that off, there's no way she could have done the same with Hifumi's body. Because, as we just established, she was passed out in the equipment room when his body disappeared.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Jill3.png"/>
   : Besides, I didn't do either of 'em anyway!
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Celeste2.png"/>
   : In other words, it is impossible that any of us could have killed Hifumi, or moved either of their bodies. On the other hand,
   <b>
    Hiro
   </b>
   and
   <b>
    Kyoko
   </b>
   had disappeared. So they most certainly could have done those things.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Makoto20.png"/>
   : Hmm... So what now, Kyoko?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Kyoko2.png"/>
   : For now, we can't get fixated on who did it, or we'll just keep going around in circles.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : So instead of "
   <b>
    who
   </b>
   " I propose we start talking about "
   <b>
    how
   </b>
   "... In particular, I think we need to figure out how Hifumi's body got moved.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Makoto26.png"/>
   : That's true. We searched everywhere, but we couldn't figure out how to explain his body disappearing. And according to what Celeste said...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Flashback.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-226.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Celeste2.png"/>
   : We could not have been gone for more than a minute or two, though.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Makoto2.png"/>
   : So then, the killer was able to get in and move Hifumi's body in that short amount of time?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Celeste2.png"/>
   : It would seem so...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Flashback.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-227.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Makoto26.png"/>
   : His body apparently disappeared in the one minute her and Hina took their eyes off it. But to carry that much weight from the 1st floor up to the 3rd, in that short amount of time...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Hiro5.png"/>
   : ...Oh man, yeah! There's no way! It'd be impossible!

   : No, actually, that was plenty.

   : He said it's only broadcast when a body is discovered "
   <b>
    for the first time

   ." Which means even if we find the same body again later, he won't make the announcement again.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Byakuya5.png"/>
   : If that's true, then why was the announcement made again later on?

   : Huh? Later on!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-Makoto25.png"/>
   : Exactly. We heard the body discovery announcement twice.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    The second body discovery announcement... The first time it played was when we found each body in the nurse's office and the equipment room... And the second time was when...

   what Monokuma just told us, doesn't it?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-Byakuya9.png"/>
   : Exactly. If we were actually "re"discovering both bodies, the announcement shouldn't have played.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-Makoto25.png"/>
   : Then in reality, when the two dead bodies were rediscovered, one of them was actually...
   <br/>

   <b>
    discovered for the first time

   : So when we found Hifumi the first time in the nurse's office, he wasn't actually dead yet... Meaning he wasn't actually found dead until we came upon him in the repository.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-Makoto25.png"/>
   : And that's just part of it... There's one other thing that leads me to believe he was still alive in the nurse's office...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="94-Jill9.png"/>
   : Oh! Oh! I know! I know!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Jill3.png"/>

   <br/>

   : That is the worst logic I have ever heard... But honestly, I do not think there's anything that can prove he was still alive.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Kyoko.png"/>
   : Okay then, let's take another look at the events surrounding the discovery of his body. Then it should become clear whether he was really alive or not.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-Celeste15.png"/>
   : This whole thing is pointless...

    There has to be proof that shows Hifumi was still alive. I have to find it and show it to everyone!

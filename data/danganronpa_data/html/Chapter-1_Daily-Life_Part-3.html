    [Leon, Hiro, Junko and Chihiro]

   all grouped up together. The same goes for
   <b>

   : Each door already has a nameplate on it, so I guess all the rooms have been assigned already.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Sakura3.png"/>
   : And each room key was attached to a keychain with the owner's name precision-etched onto it.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Which confirms that the room I was in earlier is, in fact, my room.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>

   : And Chihiro and I found out that all the rooms are totally soundproof.

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Junko7.png"/>
   : But it looked like there were only locks on the bathrooms in the girls' dorms.

    Huh? But when I checked my bathroom door before, it definitely seemed like it was locked... That's weird... I should double-check that later.

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Hina2.png"/>
   : But there were gates there, and we couldn't find any way to open them, so we couldn't check it out.

   that controls the world from the shadows. My family is a member of that council. And I have within me the bloodline that will allow me to one day bend the world to my will... But to become such a ruler, I must know all levels of this world backwards and forwards. So whenever I have time, I like to review whatever documents and materials that interest me. Which is why I can proclaim, without a doubt, that the materials gathered here are
   <b>
    the real thing
   </b>
   .

    This is beyond believing or not believing. Byakuya is actually starting to scare me more than the actual mastermind...

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Byakuya9.png"/>
   : And what always interested me the most were the "
   <b>
    cold case
   </b>
   " police investigation reports. Reading through those reports has always been a hobby of mine, ever since I was little. It's excellent mental exercise. I've solved more than a few of those cases just by reviewing the reports. And among all those reports, one of my recent favorites is the
   <b>
    Genocide Jack
   </b>
   case.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    As he talked, Byakuya grabbed a specific file from the shelf.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Byakuya7.png"/>
   : This is the complete case file. Every single report surrounding the Genocide Jack cases has been compiled in here.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Byakuya9.png"/>
   : Because there are so many, allow me to quickly summarize the main points. To begin, there are two notable characteristics in every Genocide Jack murder. The first characteristic is that at every crime scene,
   <b>
    the word "bloodlust" is written in the victim's own blood
   </b>
   . And the second...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-262.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Byakuya9.png"/>
   : ...is that when the victims are murdered, their bodies are
   <b>
    suspended
   </b>
   in a certain way.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    "Bloodlust" written in blood, and the victim's body is suspended... It's exactly the same as what happened to Chihiro!
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-256.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Byakuya3.png"/>
   : Save your surprise. The best part is yet to come. For the second characteristic, where the
   <b>
    victims are suspended
   </b>
   ... The only ones who knew about that particular fact were members of the police and other higher-ups. By all accounts, nobody in the media ever found out.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Huh...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Byakuya3.png"/>
   : In other words, no one on the news, no one online, *nobody* knew about that aspect of each crime. Only key officials and the killer himself knew about this act of "mounting" the victim.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Byakuya9.png"/>
   : Now, if you'll recall Chihiro's corpse, her body was most certainly mounted in this fashion.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : So...how could the killer have
   <b>
    known about suspending the victim
   </b>
   ...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Byakuya3.png"/>
   : That's the key question. But in fact, the answer is quite simple.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-263.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Byakuya5.png"/>
   : The culprit isn't a copycat killer... It's
   <b>
    the real Genocide Jack
   </b>
   .
   <br/>

   : ...Gh!

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Byakuya8.png"/>
   : That right there is the
   <b>
    evidence
   </b>
   that Genocide Jack has hidden himself among the rest of us.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Th-Then...Genocide Jack really is... Such a brutal, fiendish killer really is walking around among us?
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Byakuya3.png"/>
   : Hmhmhm. Things are really starting to get interesting, aren't they? I never imagined a killer with such a reputation would ever become part of our little game. Now, don't you think it would be good for you to take a look at what I've already seen? You might just manage to ferret out a clue or two. If you get down on your knees and beg, I might even show you myself.

Komatsuna Taro, Takefumi Gono, Udhida Naohisa, Takeshi Masamune, Yuto Yumejima, there was no end to it... But one thing became perfectly clear as I read... All of the killer's countless victims were
    <b>
     killed and suspended in exactly the same way
    </b>
    . And at the scene of every murder, the word "
    <b>
     bloodlust
    </b>
    " was left in the victim's own blood.

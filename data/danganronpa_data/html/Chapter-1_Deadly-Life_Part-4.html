   : Next on the list, we need to get the DVD from Sayaka's room and also we want to check out the Trash Room. But first, someone's hanging out in the hall.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-224.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Leon11.png"/>
   : Something doesn't seem right. The Monokuma File said Sayaka was killed in your room. I just can't stop thinking about it. Could it be...the
   <b>
    nameplate
   </b>
   ?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Narration.png"/>
   : Nameplate? What's he talking about? The room nameplates?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-225.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Huh? This *is* Sayaka's room, right? But the nameplate has my name on it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-226.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Huh? This is definitely my room, but the nameplate has Sayaka's name on it.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Makoto2.png"/>
   : The nameplates on my room and Sayaka's room were switched!?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    So all that effort I put into switching rooms without anyone knowing was totally pointless. But, why would anyone do that?
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-227.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Narration.png"/>

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-229.png"/>

    There can only be one thing in the trash can. Yup. The DVD with Sayaka's name on it.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Sayaka got really upset after seeing whatever was in that video.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    I wonder...what did she see? It might not be directly related to the case, but it might be worth checking out anyway.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Makoto2.png"/>
   : I'm sorry, Sayaka. I need to borrow this DVD.

   <br/>
   <i>
    The door won't budge. It must be locked.

    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-233.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There's a sturdy gate here. No way to get past...

   : It's the end of the line. The trash room... This is where all the trash in the school eventually winds up.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Makoto2.png"/>
   : How do you get this gate open?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Monokuma.png"/>
   : No no no! No entry beyond this point! Only the person on cleaning duty is allowed in!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Cleaning duty?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Monokuma.png"/>
   : No no no! No entry beyond this point! Only the person on cleaning duty is allowed in!
   <br/>

   : Who's on cleaning duty?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Monokuma.png"/>
   : No no no! No entry beyond this point! Only the person on cleaning duty is allowed in!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    This is stupid. It'd be faster to just go around and ask the others.
   </i>
   <br/>

   : Back outside, Byakuya is the first person we run into. Let's see if he knows about cleaning duty.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-237.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Byakuya, can you tell me anything about cleaning duty?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Byakuya.png"/>
   : ...No.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-238.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Byakuya7.png"/>
   : You're like a child lost in the woods, you know that? A total waste of space.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Makoto2.png"/>
   : What do you mean?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Byakuya.png"/>
   : Taka's the one who has any interest in organizing things like that.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Oh, good point.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-239.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Narration.png"/>
   : Well he didn't directly know but he told us who would. Taka's in the 1st floor hallways but before we talk to him, we wanted to see if Chihiro could tell us anything about those numbers Sayaka wrote.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-240.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Narration.png"/>
   : One quick warp to the gym later...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-241.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Hey, Chihiro. I was hoping I could ask you something.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Chihiro.png"/>
   : Oh, what is it?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Before she died, Sayaka left a message. She wrote out the numbers
   <b>
    11037
   </b>
   . Do you have any idea what these numbers might mean? Like, could they be a code or something?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-243.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Chihiro14.png"/>
   : Umm... Sorry, no...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Chihiro slowly shook her head.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-244.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Chihiro8.png"/>
   : I-I'm sorry. I just don't know.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Okay. Well, don't worry about it. Thanks anyway for trying.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Even she doesn't know. Or, could she maybe know more than she's letting on? ...No, couldn't be.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-245.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Narration.png"/>
   : Now to speak with Taka.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-246.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Taka.png"/>
   : Cleaning duty, eh? As a matter of fact, Monokuma came and talked to me yesterday morning!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Really!?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-247.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Taka7.png"/>
   : He probably realized I was basically in charge, so he decided to talk to me directly! The topic of conversation was assigning cleaning duty!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Oh, so you're on cleaning duty now?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Taka.png"/>
   : Actually, no.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Huh? Okay, then who is?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-248.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Taka3.png"/>
   : Hifumi was also there when we had this conversation. He volunteered right away, so I let him have it!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Makoto2.png"/>
   : So *he's* on cleaning duty, then.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Taka.png"/>
   : Indeed. But we'll swap out on a weekly basis. I'm sure you'll be up before too long.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-249.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Taka8.png"/>
   : And when that time comes, I'll be counting on you!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-250.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Narration.png"/>
   : Back in the dorms, Hifumi is also hanging around outside Makoto's room.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-251.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Umm...I'm looking for whoever's on cleaning duty.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Hifumi.png"/>
   : Cleaning duty? As a matter of fact, that's me. Why do you ask? It just so happens Monokuma talked to me yesterday and asked me to take care of it. Without someone on cleaning duty, the school would be flooded with trash in no time.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-252.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Hifumi4.png"/>
   : So I formally applied for the position!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Hifumi.png"/>
   : I was gonna start this morning, but after what happened, I haven't had a chance to get started.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Makoto2.png"/>
   : And since you're on cleaning duty, you can open the gate in front of the trash room?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-253.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Hifumi21.png"/>
   : Of course! It's my job to gather up all the garbage and toss it in the trash room. And to do that, they gave me the key for the trash room gate!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Hifumi4.png"/>
   : But we're supposed to rotate once a week, so eventually you'll be in charge.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-254.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Byakuya9.png"/>
   : Wait, hold on. You need a key to get in the trash room? And only the person on cleaning duty has access to the key? What's the point of going to all that trouble? Why not just leave the trash room open all the time so we can all throw things out whenever we want?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Makoto2.png"/>
   : That does seem more convenient.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Byakuya9.png"/>
   : Actually...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-255.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-256.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Byakuya3.png"/>
   : That must be why. If anyone could go in and out of the trash room whenever they wanted, then destroying evidence would be easy. The thrill would disappear, and things would become boring.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Makoto2.png"/>
   : B-Boring!?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-257.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-Leon13.png"/>
   : Anyway, more important than that...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Leon15.png"/>
   : Hey fatty! Why'd you want the cleaning duty gig, anyway!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Hifumi6.png"/>
   : I-I just decided to volunteer for something I knew no one else would wanna do. What's the big deal!?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-260.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Leon15.png"/>
   : Liar! I know why you did it.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Leon11.png"/>
   : You wanna dig through all the girls' trash! Looking for...y'know...and poking around at it!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Hifumi4.png"/>
   : What are you talking about!? All my love is for 2D!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Leon14.png"/>
   : But there's all kinds of trash diggers like that! Maybe you'll get tired of 2D, and then turn to--
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-262.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Hifumi13.png"/>
   : I would NEVER get tired of 2D!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Hifumi15.png"/>
   : After spending a significant amount of time comparing 2D and 3D, I voluntarily chose 2D! The only thing 3D is good for is to shower love and affection on 2D! Oh, and PVC figures!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Leon2.png"/>
   : How are you not totally embarrassed to say stuff like that!?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-265.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Byakuya.png"/>
   : If you're so worried about Hifumi's questionable morality, there's a very easy solution. Whenever a guy has cleaning duty, Sakura can accompany then, from picking up the trash to disposing of it.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Hifumi10.png"/>
   : Whaaat!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Byakuya2.png"/>
   : If you're as innocent as you claim, where's the harm in it?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-Hifumi12.png"/>
   : Kh--! That's not how it's supposed to--!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Anyway, on another topic... Hufumi, since you were on cleaning duty, I have a favor to ask you.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-269.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-Hifumi3.png"/>
   : What, so now you suddenly want to join my party? Sorry, but you haven't triggered that flag yet. I mean, you haven't helped me recover from a past trauma, or save a village, or beat a boss.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Makoto2.png"/>
   : No, nothing like that. I was just hoping to get into the trash room and look around.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Hifumi21.png"/>
   : Oh, okay!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Makoto2.png"/>
   : So easy...!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    So, Hifumi and I headed down to the trash room.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-231.png"/>
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-Hifumi3.png"/>
   : You'd like me to open the gate, wouldn't you?

    green button

   to get it going, and the
   <b>
    yellow button

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-Hifumi17.png"/>
   : Yesterday, as soon as I was appointed, I came down to check the place out. It definitely wasn't on then. I haven't been back to the trash room since then. And since I'm the only one who has a key to open the gate...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-Hifumi18.png"/>

    Anyway. This is... It looks like a piece of cloth. And the shape... It's part of the sleeve from a button-up shirt! And now that I look at it, that's definitely blood on the cuff! Which means...!

    There are shards of broken glass scattered around in front of the incinerator. It looks like it used to be some kind of glass ball, just about big enough to fit in the palm of your hand.

    Yeah, I get what you're trying to say. But who did this particular ball belong to? There's only one person it could be. They should all still be in the

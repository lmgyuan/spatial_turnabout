   <br/>

   : Yeah, good idea.
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Makoto2.png"/>
   : The mastermind did it...? Because they assumed we wouldn't be doing the class trial over again, I guess...

   <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-510.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    You know, I think I've seen a tarp like this somewhere before...

    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-511.png"/>

    <br/>
    Ah, it's the same as the one I found in the garden toolshed...! And if I remember, that tarp...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-512.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>

    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Flashback.png"/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-509.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And that's the tarp that was used to help camouflage the murder in the garden... At some point, someone got it from the bio lab and took it over there.

   : ...What is it?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Makoto2.png"/>
   : It's about that announcement Monokuma made earlier...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : You mean the one about a "hint" or something? I didn't take him up on the offer.
   <br/>

   : Huh? Why not?

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Kyoko7.png"/>
   : The only reason he'd give us a "hint" at this point would be to confuse us, to cloud our judgment. I can solve this mystery on my own, without whatever hints he may have to offer.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Makoto2.png"/>
   : That's...a good point.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    I wish I could go back and do the same thing, but what's done is done, I guess... Standing here looking at her...I don't think she's hiding anything from me. Is she right? Did the mastermind forge that picture as a trap to confuse us? That's gotta be it. There's no other explanation...

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Kyoko3.png"/>
   : I paid careful attention to the wounds and the traces of blood. And it seems highly likely that the stomach wound and blow to the back of the head were inflicted
   <b>
    after death
   </b>
   .
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Really...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Kyoko3.png"/>
   : The burnt tissue made things a little difficult, but I'm completely confident in my findings.

They had also been struck in the head with an object about as thick as a metal pipe. The body was covered with other wounds, but these were at least several days old."

   : The only other option is those "

   : I...guess I don't see the difference.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Kyoko14.png"/>
   : Well the difference is immense, considering the impression they give.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : You seem to be equating "several days old" with simple "
   <b>
    old
   </b>
   ".
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Kyoko13.png"/>
   : But that doesn't quite follow logically. "Old wounds," it makes it sound like they've been there forever, like they're not related to the murder.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Are you saying...they are? But we all got the Monokuma File right after she was killed, right? So if the wounds were at least a few days old, there's no way they could've had anything to do with it.

   : What...!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Kyoko13.png"/>
   : Certainly you can allow it as one of the many possibilities, can't you?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Makoto2.png"/>
   : One of...many?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : A detective doesn't have supernatural powers. There's no way to predict the answer from the beginning. Instead, the ideal detective begins by imagining as many possible scenarios as they can.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Kyoko13.png"/>
   : They envision these possibilities without prejudice, without bias, using only their logic and common sense. Then, as they investigate, they test what they find against each of these possibilities.

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Kyoko15.png"/>
   : Of course, me telling you this doesn't mean you'll be any good at detective work. but beyond using that to solve this particular mystery, you should keep it in mind for the future.

   : ...What makes you say that...? Like I said, only the locker's owner should be able to get into it, right? I can't imagine those lockers belonged to any of us... After all, we only got access to that area just recently. What I'm saying is, there's no way I could've had access to any of those lockers. And if I *did* have a pocketbook, why would I bother putting it in a locker?
   <br/>

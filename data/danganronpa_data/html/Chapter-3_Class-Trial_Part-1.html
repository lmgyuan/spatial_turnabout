   <br/>

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Byakuya5.png"/>

   <br/>

   <br/>

    Wow...I've never had anyone sound so nice while being so mean. But maybe I can change her mind if I can just explain to them why the dolly must have been moved from the equipment room to the repository!

   : Let's talk about
   <b>
    reloading
   </b>
   . Starting with this next Bullet Time Battle, we're gonna add one more ingredient to the recipe. On the bottom of the screen, underneath the Tempo Marker, you'll see your
   <b>
    ammo count
   </b>
   . Up until now, there hasn't really been a limit on how you destroy your opponent's statements. But from now on, just locking on and pressing the Triangle button won't be enough to handle them. Now it will cost you
   <b>
    one bullet
   </b>
   to
   <b>
    destroy a single remark
   </b>
   . Once you run out of bullets, you can't destroy any more statements, no matter how locked on you are. However, you can
   <b>
    reload
   </b>
   by pressing the
   <b>
    Square button
   </b>
   . Just like locking on, you'll have to press the Square button in time with the Tempo Marker. Basically, just remember that the Square button now has a function along with the X and Triangle buttons. You will
   <b>
    automatically reload
   </b>
   at the start of
   <b>
    Fever Time
   </b>
   and your ammo
   <b>
    will not decrease
   </b>
   . Well then...good luck, and have fun!

   : Oof... Reloading makes BTBs a lot more challenging and if you watch the video you'll see I did not do great at balancing bullets in my counter.

   : So there's the ammo counter. You get 6 bullets. One bullet depletes for every statement you shoot. Reloading will restore back one bullet. Because of the Handiwork skill that I have equipped, I will reload two bullets per reload.
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Narration.png"/>
   : The biggest problem I encountered was generally forgetting to reload enough bullets to shoot all of the statements I was trying to lock on to. Since you do more damage to your opponent if you destroy more statements at one time, obviously you want to string together a large number of them.
   <br/>
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Narration.png"/>
   : The problem is that at the same time you're timing your button presses you also have to be aware of how many bullets are in your counter. If you run out of bullets you can't break a statement. If that happens, you might start panicking as I did in the video when I realized I was out, and some statements might break through and damage your Influence Gauge.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Narration.png"/>
   : The smart thing to do is to just reload bullets as soon as you use them like I did in my second recording (the run where these images come from). At least activating Fever Time is basically a free pass to the end of the BTB because it gives you a never-depleting ammo counter for its duration. Regardless, I appreciate that reloading mixes up an otherwise kind of boring minigame but it can mess you up if you're not paying close attention.

   : If you're asking for proof that the dolly moved, I have it right here... When I found the dolly in the repository, one of the wheels had a
   <b>
    bloodstain
   </b>
   on it.

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="96-Makoto30.png"/>
   : There was a pool of blood in the equipment room with a tire mark in it that matched the dolly wheel's tread. The killer probably rolled the dolly through the blood on accident as they wheeled the body out of the room. And as the blood dried on the tire, they moved the body into the repository.

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="101-Hina9.png"/>
   : Yeah! The subject of how Robo Justice didn't do it! Cuz if it's not a killer robot, then...

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Byakuya5.png"/>
   : I'd be happy to explain why the occupant of the suit couldn't possibly be the killer. If you look back on
   <b>
    how the body was transported
   </b>
   , it will become immediately obvious.

    If I look at how the body was moved, it'll be clear why the person in the suit couldn't have done it... What does he mean by that...?

   : My original plan was to meet with Toko but there's one big catch when trying to do an FTE with her. Depending on what point you're at in the story, she might be herself or she might be Genocide Jill. Right now, she happens to be Jill.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-Narration.png"/>
   : Now, Genocide Jill actually does have an FTE chain but well...I'm not actually sure how to activate it. I can talk to her, spend time with her and give her a present just like normal. The problem is that as soon as she finishes accepting the present the game kicks me straight back to Makoto's room with no FTE occurring. I think I read somewhere that you might have to do all of Toko's FTEs before you can do Jill's events. If that's the case, Jill's events will most likely be held until the end of the game because I'll have better access to her in School Mode.

   : I'm going to cut-off the tutorial here. In theory, Reactions are basically a small mechanic in which you can change a conversation's direction by pushing Triangle to select the purple words in a sentence, then pressing X to continue the conversation. In practice however, Reactions don't affect the conversations that much because there's basically no reason not to React to every instance that they show up. In fact, sometimes you MUST React to something to progress the story.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Narration.png"/>
   : They are used more heavily in the beginning of the game to demonstrate the feature, but most of what is said in a Reaction conversation is stuff you could have learned even if you skip the Reaction. They're harmless enough, but I'm not a big fan of them. The writers could have accomplished what Reactions do by just writing the conversations a little better.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Narration.png"/>
   : I'm going to represent them in text with
   <b>
    [bolded square brackets]

   as best I can, as long as it doesn't break BBCode to do so.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Narration.png"/>
   : Let's skip the rest of the tutorial because I've basically explained everything it was going to and get back to the game.

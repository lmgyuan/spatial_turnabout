    I heard Hina talking, but my eyes stared steadily forward. I could only look forward. I could only look on...at

   <i>
    Muttering to herself, Kyoko began to gently inspect Sakura's body. I wondered, was she confirming that Sakura really was dead? Checking for a pulse, or a reaction?

   : Why...? Why...did this have to happen?

   <br/>
   <i>
    That's all I could say. I repeated it over and over again...

   <br/>

    I just stood there motionless behind her, while she checked Sakura's corpse. Time passed. While I stood there, unable to do a thing, time just...passed. And after I don't know how long...

   <b>
    Sakura was murdered

   . And by someone in this very room... Is that what you were going to say?
   <br/>

   : ...No. Whoever killed her...it's not just "someone in this room."

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Hina17.png"/>
   : I don't need to investigate anything... Because you hated her. You hated the sight of her! One of you did it, I know it!

   : Huh huh?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Makoto2.png"/>

   : Sorry, not quite! Actually, not even close.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Monokuma5.png"/>
   : That whole thing is totally irrelevant now! Sakura came to a most regrettable end without even getting the chance to finish things with me...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Monokuma10.png"/>
   : Which, thank God for that! It saved me the trouble of having to go through with our little fight.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Monokuma8.png"/>
   : Cuz even for someone like me, it would've been no mean feat to take down a behemoth like that!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Monokuma2.png"/>
   : I gotta tell ya, I was actually pretty worried! I mean, she'd violated a rule by attacking me in the first place, but I wasn't able to punish her!

   : Y-You owe them one!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Monokuma4.png"/>
   : Oopsie! Before you get all pissy-potty at me, you better figure out who did it first!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Monokuma12.png"/>
   : Cuz I mean...your lives are all on the line, right?

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Byakuya2.png"/>
   : Then let's decide who will stand guard this time.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Hina16.png"/>
   : ...I'll do it.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Hina...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Hina16.png"/>
   : I'm okay... Just let me handle it...!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Hina17.png"/>
   : Besides, I...I want to be here...with Sakura.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-036.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Byakuya.png"/>
   : Okay, then Hina is guard number one. But we need one more.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Byakuya2.png"/>
   : Kyoko, that's you.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kyoko7.png"/>
   : ...Me?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Byakuya4.png"/>
   : You're always a thorn in my side. This time just stand by and watch quietly. Consider that an order.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Makoto2.png"/>
   : An o-order!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Kyoko2.png"/>
   : Fine. I'll stay behind.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-031.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Byakuya3.png"/>
   : Then it's settled. Let's begin, shall we?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Hina16.png"/>
   : ...Hold on! Before that, there's something I want to say.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Byakuya2.png"/>
   : Which is...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Hina16.png"/>
   : Hiro, Byakuya, Toko--none of you are allowed to step foot in the crime scene.
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Hina17.png"/>
   : I won't let someone like that come anywhere near her!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Byakuya5.png"/>
   : Don't be stupid. Our lives are in just as much danger as yours! We have every right to investigate.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Hina17.png"/>
   : I don't care what you say. I'm not letting the one who killed Sakura anywhere near her.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Hina18.png"/>
   : Even if it means I have to use force, you're not getting in here...!

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Byakuya15.png"/>
   : Well, it appears further discussion would be a waste of time. How about a compromise?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Byakuya4.png"/>
   : I won't ask you to let all of us in. Just let me.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Hiro8.png"/>
   : What!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Byakuya.png"/>
   : You don't really care, do you? You're both useless, anyway.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-044.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Jill9.png"/>
   : Nope, don't really caaaare!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Jill6.png"/>
   : I'd rather spend my time coming up with another splendid fantasy involving Master, anyway!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Byakuya7.png"/>
   : And you, Hiro? Do you really object?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Hiro4.png"/>
   : I-If you're gonna go that far, what can I do? I mean, I don't have anything to hide, so why should I care?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Byakuya3.png"/>
   : Then it's decided.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Hina18.png"/>
   : Nothing's decided!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-047.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : I know how you feel, Hina, but you should agree to his request.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Hina17.png"/>
   : B-But--!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : We have to find out who killed Sakura.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Kyoko13.png"/>
   : For those of us still alive, and to honor Sakura's memory...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Hina17.png"/>
   : ...Fine. I guess that's okay. But no matter what, Byakuya, you absolutely aren't allowed to touch her...!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Byakuya3.png"/>
   : Naturally. Who would want to touch a filthy dead body?

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Kyoko13.png"/>
   : That's enough fighting. We need to focus on the investigation from here on out. Everyone, keep this in mind. If we can't uncover Sakura's killer...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Kyoko14.png"/>
   : ...all of us face execution.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Finding out who killed Sakura... It's not a matter of hoping we can do it... If we want to survive, we *have* to do it. It's a kind of...hopeless hope. We have no choice but to just do it...!

   "The victim was Sakura Ogami. The time of death is estimated to be around 12 noon. The body was discovered in the rec room, on the 3rd floor of the school. There is evidence of a strong blow to the victim's head. No other injuries were noted. However, it seems that at some point, the victim suffered from violent vomiting of blood."

   : Why's that...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : The only way into the rec room is the door we just came through. And that door had been jammed shut with the chair from inside the rec room. Which means the killed would have had to escape somehow, *after* barring the door.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Makoto2.png"/>
   : So if the door was blocked from the inside, and there was no way in or out till we broke the window... There's like...zero escape, right?

    locked room murder

   : L-Locked room murder...?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    I guess you might see this kind of thing a lot in mystery movies or books or whatever. But could it really happen in real life...? And right before our very eyes like this?
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Kyoko2.png"/>
   : Are you curious to hear more about what a "locked room" murder entails?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Makoto2.png"/>
   : S-Sure, if you don't mind...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-057.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : When you break down this type of murder mystery, there are
   <b>
    four basic types
   </b>
   . The first type is when
   <b>
    the locked room is created after the actual crime is committed
   </b>
   . This simply means that the killer commits his crime, then through some special method seals the room. This mainly involves some sort of trick involving the "locking" of the room. Basic approaches include using a string, or simple mechanism. There are a number of variations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    So for that, all we'd have to do is check the door to see if that's what it was, right?
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-059.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Kyoko2.png"/>
   : The second type is when
   <b>
    the locked room already exists before the crime is committed
   </b>
   .
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Oh...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : Basically, the killer uses a special contraption or tool from outside to target the victim inside. You push a switch and it fires a handgun, you shoot an arrow through a gap in the door, something like that.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : But in this case, that doesn't seem to fit. There are no guns or arrows in the school, and the door doesn't have any gap that would allow it...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Yeah, I think we can probably cross that one off the list...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-061.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-Kyoko.png"/>
   : The third type is when
   <b>
    the killer stays in the room until it's opened up
   </b>
   .
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Makoto2.png"/>
   : What do you mean by that...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : They stay hidden, and when the door is opened, they use the confusion to blend in with the group. They pretend they showed up along with everyone else, and that's that.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    That sounds like it could have been possible...maybe...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-057.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : And the fourth and final type is when
   <b>
    it wasn't actually a locked room at all
   </b>
   .
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Not a locked room...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : By that I mean, there actually is an alternate escape route somewhere within the room. You see this a lot in novels and things, but in reality it's generally not possible.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Then you think we can cross that one off, too?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-060.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : I believe so, yes. So, when it comes to locked room mysteries, those are the basics.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Makoto2.png"/>
   : So there are four possibilities... Then...Kyoko, which of those four choices seems the most likely in this case?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Kyoko2.png"/>
   : That's a good question. Answering that should be our primary focus during this trial. But right now...I can't really say.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Makoto2.png"/>
   : I see...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-053.png"/>
   <br/>

    The way the killer set up the locked room... Until I figure that out, the truth behind Sakura's death will stay hidden. It's definitely a tough mystery... I need to concentrate and investigate as much as I can. For Sakura, if nothing else...

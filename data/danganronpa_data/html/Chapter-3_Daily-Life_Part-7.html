   : However, at one point there were plans to let him have at least one FTE as Kiyondo. There is an unused FTE conversation still remaining in the game's files. It can't be accessed ingame, but the good people over at The Cutting Room Floor have extracted it along with many other unused things from this game. The following conversation was taken from this page specifically but

   : This event would have given the player one Skill Point. If Kiyondo's character sounds different from what we've seen of it so far, don't forget that this isn't an official translation. Additionally, I went and changed the names from last names to first names to match the LP.

   : I'd say my specialty is solid stand-up that transitions into grappling and a strong ground game. Essentially, it's a complete approach. Anything else just wouldn't make sense. You can only become the best by reaching the top of each discipline, then fusing them all together.

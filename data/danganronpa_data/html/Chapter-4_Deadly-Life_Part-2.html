   : We've got a lot of stuff to investigate this time. Let's start by going over Sakura's body.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-063.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Sakura drew her last breath sitting slumped forward in this chair... There's obvious evidence of the
    <b>
     blow to the head
    </b>
    Sakura suffered... Normally, I wouldn't have any problem believing that that's what killed her. But according to the Monokuma File, she had also
    <b>
     vomited blood
    </b>
    ...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-064.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    And I can see a
    <b>
     trace of blood
    </b>
    on her lips for sure. So...what would have caused her to vomit blood? The Monokuma File specifically said she hadn't suffered any other injuries...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-065.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Maybe her getting hit on the head somehow caused her to start vomiting blood?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Byakuya.png"/>
   : Not a chance.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Makoto2.png"/>
   : B-Byakuya...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Byakuya3.png"/>
   : However, your eyes have landed on a most interesting location.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Interesting...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Byakuya4.png"/>
   : Yes, most interesting. Don't you agree?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Makoto2.png"/>
   : N-No, I don't think I'd call it "interesting."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    But it does make me wonder... The reason
    <b>
     Sakura vomited blood
    </b>
    absolutely has to be connected to why she died...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-132.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Narration.png"/>
   : Let's see what Kyoko thinks of this whole situation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-133.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kyoko7.png"/>
   : But for Sakura to have been killed...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Yeah, she's not the type who would go down without a fight.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Kyoko12.png"/>
   : And she certainly didn't, I would say. She was the
   <b>
    Ultimate Martial Artist
   </b>
   , strong in body, mind, and spirit. So how was the killer able to get the upper hand on her...? I wonder...*did* someone get the upper hand...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Makoto2.png"/>
   : They must have taken her by surprise, right?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : Certainly, they would've needed to if they expected to stand any chance against her.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-069.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-070.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    This looks like...some kind of
    <b>
     wrapper
    </b>
    .
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Hina9.png"/>
   : Ah, that's--!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Do you recognize it, Hina?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Hina2.png"/>
   : Well yeah. I mean, I gave it to her... That's a candy wrapper. Sakura got super upset when she found out Genocide Jack had attacked me, right? So
   <b>
    after we left the nurse's office
   </b>
   , I gave it to her. I thought it might help her calm down a little...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Makoto2.png"/>
   : So you gave that candy to Sakura...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-073.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Hina14.png"/>
   : I found a big box of it in the warehouse. I...really like 'em... Actually, as soon as we could get into the warehouse, I took the entire box back to my room. I made sure
   <b>
    nobody else could get their hands on 'em.
   </b>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Makoto2.png"/>
   : You really like them that much?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Hina4.png"/>
   : But I wanted Sakura to get a chance to try one for herself. That's why I gave it to her... But now...they've lost all their flavor.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Hina...
   <br/>
   <br/>

    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-078.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It's...a

     handprint
    </b>
    ?
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Kyoko12.png"/>
   : What's a handprint doing here?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Makoto2.png"/>
   : It looks like someone touched
   <b>
    the inside of the locker
   </b>
   , and it left a handprint in all the dust...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Kyoko12.png"/>
   : And it looks quite fresh, too. I'd say someone was hiding here in the locker, and they left behind a little something extra...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Makoto2.png"/>
   : So then...! Maybe the killer
   <b>
    hid in here
   </b>
   until the locked room was opened, don't you think? And during all the confusion, they popped out and joined the rest of the group!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-081.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : Unfortunately, that's not a possibility.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Huh? Why not?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Kyoko.png"/>
   : Think back. Before we opened the door, we looked inside the room, right?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-FlashT.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-083.png"/>

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Oh yeah... And the locker was
   <b>
    already open
   </b>
   at that point...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : So there's no way someone could have hidden in there until *after* we opened the door.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Yeah. So then...what does this handprint mean?
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-084.png"/>

   <br/>
   <i>
    There are
    <b>
     shards of glass
    </b>
    scattered all around the chair Sakura was sitting on. The glass is all...red. And... These are...the top and bottom sections of a bottle, right? So this must have originally been a

    <br/>

    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-089.png"/>
    <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>

   <b>
    ship in a bottle

   .
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Makoto2.png"/>
   : ...Huh?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : You know, where the bottle's opening is smaller than the boat placed inside? You've never seen that?
   <br/>

   : Oh, yeah...maybe I have.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Kyoko12.png"/>

   <b>
    Monokuma Bottle

   : I feel like I'm finally starting to make sense of things, little by little...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    The Monokuma Bottles sitting on the shelf... The Monokuma figure we found on the ground... The red shards of glass, which probably started out as a bottle... Which would mean...Sakura must have been hit in the head with a Monokuma Bottle, right? The shards of glass and the Monokuma figure are evidence of that... So I think it's safe to say that the
    <b>
     Monokuma Bottle
    </b>
    was the weapon.

    But the fact that she had asked those three to meet with her. And she asked them to come to the rec room at noon--the same time and place she ended up dying... It might be good to
    <b>
     confirm
    </b>
    what I just heard with the three of them directly.

    This door is the

     only way
    </b>
    in or out of the rec room... The door doesn't have a lock, and there's no evidence that the mountings have been tampered with. The only notable change to the door is...the smashed window. Which happened, of course, when I broke it to get inside... There's no evidence that any kind of string or mechanism was used on the door... In other words...

    The chair was shoved up against the doorknob, so we couldn't gt the door open. There's no evidence that any kind of string or mechanism was used on the chair...

    Hmm... Having examined both the door and the chair, there's no doubt the reason the door didn't open was simply because the chair was shoved up against it. This kept the doorknob from turning, and the door from opening. And there was no evidence of the door or chair being tampered with or anything like that... So the killer must have created the locked door

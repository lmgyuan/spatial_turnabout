   : Last time, we stopped in the dorm halls. We're supposed to go talk to Toko and Hiro about the note they supposedly received from Sakura.

   : Y-Yeah, pretty much... So, can you tell me about it?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Toko4.png"/>
   : I a-admit, I did
   <b>
    get the note
   </b>
   ... B-But I didn't go
   <b>
    see her
   </b>
   ! I was s-scared, so...I couldn't bring m-myself to go!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Hmm... Toko claims she didn't go see her, but...can I really believe her? Well, until I can prove otherwise, I have no choice but to accept it as fact.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Toko4.png"/>
   : Is that g-good enough? Then I'm going back to m-my room... *leaves*
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    With that, Toko quickly retreated into her room.

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-150.png"/>
   <br/>

   <b>
    [need something]
   </b>
   ?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <b>
    &gt; need something
   </b>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Yeah, actually...I just wanted to check something. It's about how Sakura wanted to meet with you...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Hiro8.png"/>
   : H-H-How'd you know about that!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Hiro7.png"/>
   : Uwah! Did you maybe...gaze into my soul? Have your special abilities awakened in you!?
   <br/>

   <br/>

   <b>
    Ogre told me herself

   that she asked Byakuya and Toko to come, too!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Makoto2.png"/>
   : What? When did Sakura tell you that?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Hiro7.png"/>
   : Oh--! W-Well...!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Hiro4.png"/>
   : When she asked me to meet with her, of course!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Makoto2.png"/>
   : But...didn't she write you a note?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Hiro5.png"/>
   : Yeah, uh...a note...she uh...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-156.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-Hiro15.png"/>
   : She gave it to me in person! And she happened to mention the others, like, in passing!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    I gotta be honest, this is super suspicious...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Makoto2.png"/>
   : So then you went and met with Sakura?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Hiro16.png"/>
   : N-No way, I totally didn't! Why would I ever do that!?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Yeah...definitely suspicious.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Hiro5.png"/>
   : The last time I saw Ogre was when Hina got hurt and I took her to the nurse's office!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-157.png"/>
   <br/>

    I haven't seen her

   : While I'm here, could you show me the note she gave you?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Hiro5.png"/>
   : Oh, um...do I still have it...? Let's see...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Hiro was feeling around in his pockets...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Hiro4.png"/>
   : Ah, sorry! Looks like I don't have it anymore!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    With a big, goofy smile on his face, he pulled his hands back out of his pockets. But when he did, I saw something flutter to the ground... Something had
    <b>
     fallen out of Hiro's pocket
    </b>
    .
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-158.png"/>

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Hiro7.png"/>
   : Ah...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Hiro9.png"/>
   : Aahhh--!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Quick as the wind, Hiro snatched it back up again and shoved it back into his pocket.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Hiro4.png"/>
   : Ehehe. Sorry, just a bit of trash I forgot to throw out...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Trash...?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-161.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Hiro6.png"/>
   : A-Anyway! I can't deny that Ogre asked to meet with me, but I never went... So, well, if you'll excuse me...! *leaves*
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Before waiting for a reply, Hiro quickly slipped back into his room. Hiro said that was just trash, but...there's no way that's all there was to it.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Narration.png"/>
   : Hiro could not have been more suspicious there unless he was covered in blood with a giant neon sign reading "I DID IT".
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-162.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Okay so I've heard from Toko and Hiro. Umm...what next? I'll definitely have to look at the actual
    <b>
     crime scene
    </b>
    again, but on top of that maybe I should find out more about the
    <b>
     protein can
    </b>
    we found on the floor of the rec room. I'm sure it must have come from the
    <b>
     chem lab
    </b>
    ...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Makoto2.png"/>
   : So...where should I start?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-163.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Narration.png"/>
   : We're going to start with the Chem Lab.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-164.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-165.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Byakuya7.png"/>
   : Makoto...did you have your eye on the chem lab, too? Just make sure you don't get in my way.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Yeah, I got it.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Byakuya7.png"/>
   : I think what you meant to say was, "Yes, sir. I understand."
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Makoto2.png"/>
   : ...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-166.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Narration.png"/>
   : I'm glad Makoto doesn't respond there. Byakuya's been getting more and more unbearable as the game goes on. Whatever the case, let's check the cabinets over here. There appears to be some stuff on the floor.
   <br/>
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <i>
    This isn't my first time seeing the shelf, but I just can't get over how big it is... I should probably take a closer look at it...

    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-168.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    It looks like three shelves have been connected together to make one giant shelf... But more important right now... What's that
    <b>
     powder
    </b>
    that's been spilled in front of the shelf? I have to be careful not to step in it...

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Let's see... What's on this shelf? There are all kinda of dietary supplements and different medicines. The
    <b>
     protein drink
    </b>
    we found in the rec room probably came from this shelf... All the containers on this shelf are
    <b>
     labeled
    </b>
    with
    <b>
     the letter A
    </b>
    , and a number. So I guess I can consider this part of the shelving unit
    <b>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Byakuya9.png"/>
   : They're
   <b>
    reagents
   </b>
   . Put simply, they're used in experiments to bring about a chemical reaction. How have you lived in such ignorance for so long? It must truly be bliss...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Makoto2.png"/>
   : I-Isn't that kinda harsh...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Byakuya.png"/>
   : What, you think studying science and mathematics has no practical application in the real world?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Byakuya3.png"/>
   : The words of a lifelong loser. Which, I suppose, suits you well.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    I...didn't even say that... Anyway, that doesn't matter. Right now I need to focus on the shelf... All the containers on this shelf are
    <b>
     labeled
    </b>
    with
    <b>
     the letter B
    </b>

    <b>
     section B
    </b>
    .
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Hmm...I don't see anything out of the ordinary here. In which case, I don't think I have to worry too much about this shelf.

    <br/>
    On this shelf is... One look and I can tell it's nothing but dangerous chemicals. These look like
    <b>
     poisons
    </b>
    and other
    <b>
     powerful chemicals
    </b>
    . All the containers on this shelf are

   <i>
    It looks like it's split into three sections. Section A has dietary supplements, section B has reagents, and section C has...lethal chemicals. Sakura must have gotten the
    <b>
     protein powder
    </b>
    from section A. But what concerns me is that in section A, there was a bottle with a label from
    <b>
     section C

    ... What was a bottle of

     poison

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    There's a broken bottle in front of the shelf. Is this where all the powder came from...? It looks like the bottle had a label on it--
    <b>
     CHEM C-4
    </b>
    ...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-188.png"/>

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Byakuya9.png"/>
   : Would you like to hear something interesting? I was on the 4th floor this morning, checking things out, and at that point...this room wasn't like this.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Then...this powder must have been spilled...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Byakuya9.png"/>
   : That's right. It could only have been around
   <b>
    the time of the incident
   </b>
   .
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    If that really is when it happened, it must be related to the case somehow.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-189.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-190.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-191.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    These are...
    <b>
     footprints
    </b>
    ? And they're only
    <b>
     in front of the left shelf
    </b>
    ...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Byakuya9.png"/>
   : How do these footprints relate to the scene as a whole? We may need to sketch out the floor plan...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Makoto2.png"/>
   : By "we"...do you mean me?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Byakuya3.png"/>
   : How kind of you to offer.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    With an insufferable smirk, he handed me a piece of paper and a pen.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Byakuya5.png"/>
   : Well? Let's go, chop chop!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Makoto2.png"/>
   : O-Okay...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    So I got to work, and before long I'd drawn up a
    <b>
     sketch
    </b>
    of the room.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-193.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Um, so...how's this?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Byakuya.png"/>
   : Not bad. For you, I mean.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    For me...?
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Byakuya9.png"/>
   : So, when you look at it like this... Interesting... It would appear that whoever left these footprints only had
   <b>
    business at the leftmost shelf
   </b>
   . They came in, went straight to that shelf, did whatever they had to do, and then left. That's what the footprints tell me. These footprints must be...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-195.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Byakuya8.png"/>
   : Makoto, are they yours?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Makoto2.png"/>
   : No!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Byakuya5.png"/>
   : Okay. Then let me see your shoes and I'll confirm their size for myself.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    I couldn't think of a reason not to, so I quietly did what Byakuya said.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Byakuya9.png"/>
   : I see... Your feet do appear to be too big. Unfortunately, I must admit these are not your footprints.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Unfortunately...?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-196.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Byakuya5.png"/>
   : But with how clear these prints are, it should be quite easy to determine who they *do* belong to.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Then these prints are a really valuable clue.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-197.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Narration.png"/>
   : Lastly, we have to check the powder between the glass shards and the footprints.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-198.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Makoto2.png"/>
   : I should probably take a good, hard look at that powder...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    There's a bunch of
    <b>
     yellow powder
    </b>
    scattered on the floor in front of the shelf.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-199.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There's also remnants of a broken bottle. It looks like the bottle was labeled
    <b>
     CHEM C-4
    </b>
    ... Also, it looks like someone left some
    <b>
     footprints in the powder.
    </b>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-193.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Based on the positioning of the prints, whoever it was only went to the
    <b>
     left side of the shelf
    </b>
    . According to Byakuya, the powder would had to have been spilled
    <b>
     right around the time of the incident
    </b>
    . That's all I can tell for now...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-200.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I've already taken a good look at the chem lab. Maybe I should take another look around the
    <b>
     rec room
    </b>
    ...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-201.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Narration.png"/>
   : Before we leave, let's quickly talk to Byakuya once more.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-202.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Byakuya9.png"/>
   : Makoto. I admit, you have a good eye for spotting useful clues.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Byakuya.png"/>
   : But you also need to learn how to make use of those clues.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Narration.png"/>
   : Let me take a moment here. One thing I've noticed is that Byakuya is sometimes really inconsistent in his character. Moments like this make you think he's having a breakthrough in his character development since he didn't insult anyone or be a general asshole like he was for the rest of the time he was here in the chem room with us. But he'll just as quickly go right back to being a jerk as soon as we walk out of here. This feels like one of those places where having a fully completed set of Free Time Events could have changed how he acts towards Makoto had the developers chosen to implement conditional dialogue. It's something that has always bugged me about his character. His character should either start warming up to the group or stay totally isolated from them but sometimes he walks the line between the two and it feels wrong to me.

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Narration.png"/>
   : Regardless of how I feel about Byakuya, we'll pick up next time back at the rec room for one more pass through the crime scene.

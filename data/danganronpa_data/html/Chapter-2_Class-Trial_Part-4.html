   : Ahem! I do apologize for keeping you waiting. Now then, let's
   <b>
    resume
   </b>
   the class trial! We've all just learned of the shocking revelation that Chihiro was actually a
   <b>
    boy
   </b>
   ! Let's pick up from there!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : Yes, well...I don't know his reason for hiding it, but the fact is, Chihiro was not a girl, but a boy.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    To think that Chihiro...was actually a guy. The thought had never even crossed my mind...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Kyoko7.png"/>
   : And because the victim was male, he would have had no problem gaining access to the boys locker room.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-437.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Byakuya10.png"/>
   : Assuming his handbook did, in fact, list his gender as male...then yes, that would be true.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Monokuma4.png"/>
   : Of course
   <b>
    his handbook said he was a boy
   </b>
   ! He dressed like a girl, but he was a boy through and through!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Kyoko14.png"/>
   : So then, there should be no issue with Makoto's initial assertion... The victim was killed in the boys locker room, and was then later moved to the girls locker room. And the killer could have easily used Sayaka or Junko's handbook to get into the girls locker room.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Taka13.png"/>
   : So Chihiro really was killed in the boys locker room!?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-436.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : I still don't understand the motive for moving the body, but...yes, that does seem plausible.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Byakuya10.png"/>
   : Well...I must admit, I did find it rather odd... I knew he felt a little...off. There was a certain incongruity to his "female" body.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Jill6.png"/>
   : This is a most titillating situation!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Byakuya9.png"/>
   : So now everything has been connected. All the mysteries have finally become clear.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-440.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Hina16.png"/>
   : Okay, well, connected or clear or whatever... We still think *you're* the killer, remember?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-Byakuya3.png"/>
   : Hmhm. Very interesting. This has become very interesting indeed...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Hifumi.png"/>
   : Ahh, he's off in his own little world...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Kyoko14.png"/>
   : What about you, Makoto? After everything we've learned, do you still think Byakuya's the killer?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Well, without a doubt Byakuya's the one that made Chihiro's death look like Genocide Jack did it.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-445.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Makoto35.png"/>
   : But...but I... I think he might not actually be the killer after all.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-Hifumi2.png"/>
   : What? But aren't you the one who accused him in the first place?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Makoto20.png"/>
   : He just seems to be too...easygoing about all this. Like he's enjoying us solving the mystery. The way he's acting, it makes it seem like it doesn't have anything to do with him.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Celeste17.png"/>
   : And you think that might be because it *doesn't* have anything to do with him?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Makoto20.png"/>
   : Plus, the evidence he left behind was a little too...how can I put it? Overt. He consciously chose to use the extension cord, knowing it could connect him to the murder. At least, that's how I see it...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Byakuya.png"/>
   : ...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Makoto2.png"/>
   : And Byakuya, when you found out the murder took place in the boys locker room, it seemed to rattle you. And then again when you found out Chihiro was actually a guy... If you really were the killer, that stuff wouldn't have had any effect on you.
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Byakuya7.png"/>
   : It's fine. I guess I'll mark it as correct, for the time being.
   <br/>

   : Mark it as...correct?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Byakuya.png"/>
   : He's right. I am not the culprit. I just happened to come across the corpse in the girls locker room, and decided to

   it.

   : Well I find it very hard to believe!
   <br/>

   : Go ahead, find it very hard to believe. You're free to be executed along with the rest of us.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Hina16.png"/>
   : If you're really telling the truth, then...why? Why'd you do that to his body?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-Byakuya3.png"/>
   : My reasons hardly matter right now. Uncovering the culprit is much more important, wouldn't you say?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Byakuya8.png"/>
   : Now then...if it wasn't me, who was it?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-Makoto26.png"/>
   : W-Well...I don't think I can say for sure without talking about it a little more.

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : No, I'm with Makoto. If there's any doubt whatsoever, we need to explore every possibility. Because if we're wrong, we all die here.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-Celeste4.png"/>
   : ...That's true. Very well then, I'm with you, too.

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-Hiro2.png"/>
   : Damn straight! Count me in!
   <br/>

   : Anyway, let's discuss this all as a group one more time. We still have to make our decision.

   into a duffel bag. And then, I assume, he headed off to exercise.

   : It seems likely that the culprit destroyed them to get rid of any evidence...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="105-Celeste7.png"/>
   : And that's when he said something that struck me as rather odd...

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Sakura4.png"/>
   : But Hina and I had invited him to exercise with us plenty of times, and he always declined...

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="111-Hiro12.png"/>
   : Probably cuz he was afraid you'd find out the secret he was hiding, right?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="105-Celeste7.png"/>
   : Which means that conversely, he must have trusted whoever he was meeting with very much. Enough so that he was willing to risk his secret being revealed...

   : Uhuhu! What a marvelous friendship!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="112-Hina20.png"/>

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="116-Kyoko16.png"/>
   : Think back to the track jacket and duffel bag the killer disposed of. Focus on the details of these items, and it should become obvious who was waiting for him.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="105-Celeste7.png"/>

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Byakuya9.png"/>
   : As was noted, the evidence is already gone. There's nothing to get fingerprints *from*.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : Maybe, but we *can* make certain
   <b>
    inferences
   </b>
   , if we just take the time to talk it out.

   <br/>

   : Easy for you to say... But fine--Celeste, did you notice
   <b>
    anything special
   </b>
   about the bag or jacket?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="120-Celeste2.png"/>
   : The bag was...just a
   <b>
    normal duffel bag
   </b>
   from the warehouse.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="98-Celeste8.png"/>
   : All the bags in there are the same, so I can't imagine what would make that one special...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-Sakura3.png"/>
   : Well, if I remember right, there was a
   <b>
    decent variety
   </b>
   of tracksuits to choose from... Do you think there might be some connection between the culprit and Chihiro's jacket?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="121-Kyoko5.png"/>
   : Perhaps. Let's explore that, and talk a bit more about the
   <b>
    jacket
   </b>
   he took.

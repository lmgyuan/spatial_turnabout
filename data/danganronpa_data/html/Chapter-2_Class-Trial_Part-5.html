   <b>
    exercise
   </b>
   .
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Kyoko12.png"/>
   : So next we have to ask... Why did he choose the specific tracksuit that he did?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Byakuya9.png"/>
   : What do you mean, the specific tracksuit?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Taka9.png"/>
   : I got it! He picked that tracksuit because it matched the one the culprit was wearing!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Mondo8.png"/>
   : So what you're saying is the killer was wearing the same
   <b>
    blue tracksuit
   </b>
   as him?
   <b>
    My tracksuit is black
   </b>
   !
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Hifumi2.png"/>
   : I-I don't even have a tracksuit... Cuz exercising sucks!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Hiro2.png"/>
   : I have a

    white tracksuit

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Celeste8.png"/>
   : Did any of that really help us get any closer to figuring out who the culprit is...?

   : This can actually be a really tricky debate if you weren't paying close enough attention. The game tries to prepare you for this by having a lot of bolded words in the preceding discussion segment but this game does like to bold lots of words and phrases often enough that you might not pay attention to every single one of them. It's one where you really have to stop and think about what you know versus what the other characters should know. I remember getting caught up on this when I played the game for the first time.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Narration.png"/>
   : In this case, someone said something about the jacket's color that no one aside from us and Celeste should know...

   : Hey, Celeste. What color *was* Chihiro's tracksuit?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Celeste8.png"/>
   : As a matter of fact, it was...
   <b>
    blue
   </b>
   .
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Makoto28.png"/>
   : And before we began the trial...did you tell anyone that?

   <br/>
   <br/>

   : The only one I told about any of this way you.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Sakura5.png"/>
   : Then...Mondo, how did you know what color Chihiro's tracksuit was?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Mondo11.png"/>
   : B-Because I--! I just--!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Taka11.png"/>
   : I-I'm sure he saw the clothes at some point in the investigation...!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Kyoko7.png"/>
   : No, that can't be it. The bag and clothes were surely disposed of by the time we began our investigation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-541.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Jill2.png"/>
   : Then the only reason he could have known what color the tracksuit was is if he saw Cherry with it before he died! That's the only possibility!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Hina2.png"/>
   : Cherry...? Are...are you talking about Chihiro?
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Mondo9.png"/>
   : J-Just by chance... I just happened to see it last night... He walked past me, and he was carrying the tracksuit in his hands.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Makoto26.png"/>
   : No, that can't be it, either. According to Celeste's testimony...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-FlashT.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-547.png"/>

   <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Makoto25.png"/>
   : When Celeste noticed it, Chihiro made a point of making sure the jacket was
   <b>
    completely in the bag
   </b>
   . If you just ran into him briefly, you couldn't possibly have seen what color the tracksuit was.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Mondo11.png"/>
   : Gh--! Nggh...!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Kyoko7.png"/>
   : It would appear you've dug your own grave.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Byakuya3.png"/>
   : Perhaps, but you handed him the shovel, didn't you? That's why you said what you did. Focus on the tracksuit, and it'll be obvious who he met with? What a bunch of nonsense.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Celeste3.png"/>
   : ...Ah, now I understand. It was all one big bluff, wasn't it? Your true intention was to draw a
   <b>
    slip of the tongue
   </b>
   from the culprit...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-553.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Celeste16.png"/>
   : That's why you said you knew who did it, to put them on edge.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : That's right. However...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Kyoko16.png"/>
   : Mondo was my target all along. I had my suspicions about him from the very beginning!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Makoto20.png"/>
   : But why...? What made you so suspicious?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : That's a good question.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-557.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <b>
    &gt; The way he talked
   </b>
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Kyoko15.png"/>
   : There was a certain turning point that tipped me off. Maybe you didn't notice it, Mondo, but you tend to
   <b>
    refer to men and women differently
   </b>
   . You only call guys "
   <b>
    dude
   </b>
   ." For girls, it's "
   <b>
    chick
   </b>
   ". And after he was killed, you happened to refer to him as "
   <b>
    dude
   </b>
   ." Once I picked up on that, it occured to me that
   <b>
    Mondo knew something we didn't
   </b>
   .
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Narration.png"/>
   : You'd be forgiven for not picking up on this. Mondo only says it once and you may or may not be playing full attention in the wake of Chihiro's death. Thankfully, it's not hard to reason out what the correct answer to the above question is.
   <br/>

   : Y-You noticed such a tiny detail!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Jill2.png"/>
   : Are you a witch? She's a witch! You're positively frightful!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Kyoko17.png"/>

   : You already told us before that the handbook has one
   <b>
    weak point
   </b>
   , didn't you?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-Monokuma.png"/>
   : Ugyah! You remember that!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-Monokuma8.png"/>
   : S-Sure, maybe I let that slip, but I never told anyone what the weak point actually was!

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Sakura5.png"/>
   : But if the handbook is supposed to never break, and two of them broke in quick succession, then...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : Then we can only assume that someone's figured out its weakness.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Kyoko.png"/>
   : You know what the weakness is, right Monokuma? So, what is it?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-Monokuma4.png"/>
   : Huh? You're asking me?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="90-Kyoko13.png"/>
   : I think it's a necessary piece of information if you want this to be a fair trial.

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-Monokuma8.png"/>
   : But...if I tell you, and someone else decided to copy it, that would be very not good...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-Hina22.png"/>
   : Just tell us already! Why would we wanna break out own handbooks!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-Monokuma.png"/>
   : *sigh* Oh well... I have a weakness for pushy demands. But you're sure you won't follow their example? Then allow me to make a special announcement! The weak point of my cutting-edge e-Handbook is...!
   <br/>
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="93-Monokuma5.png"/>
   : When it's exposed to high temperatures for too long, it will suffer a meltdown and totally brrreak!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-Hifumi14.png"/>
   : I flippin' knew it!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="94-Makoto33.png"/>
   : ...You knew it?

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-Hifumi14.png"/>
   : Yeah, cuz I found the handbook laying on the floor of the
   <b>
    sauna
   </b>
   !

   : The temperature in the sauna can reach over 200 degrees. Strange how you don't get burnt, huh!? It's because as your sweat evaporates, it creates a cooling layer of air around your skin! If the hot air of the sauna were somehow puched directly onto your skin, you'd definitely get fried! That layer of air would get blown away. That's why you may feel a burning when you move around. So when you're in a sauna, make sure to keep nice and still!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="98-Taka7.png"/>
   : Wow, interesting! I learned one new fact today!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-Hifumi17.png"/>
   : That is a mere trifling speck of knowledge!

   : Anyway... If you found the victim's handbook in the sauna then the killer must have been purposely trying to raise its temperature in order to break it.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="101-Sakura3.png"/>
   : Meaning the culprit somehow knew its weakness...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="102-Hina20.png"/>
   : But how'd they find out? Monokuma said he didn't tell anyone, right?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="103-Hifumi18.png"/>
   : Indeed, quite the mystery...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="104-621.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="105-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : What if they found out by accident?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Sakura5.png"/>
   : What do you mean, by accident?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="105-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : What if the killer took their own handbook into the sauna, not knowing its weakness, and it broke? They'd realize it was broken, of course, and it wouldn't be hard to figure out why. And once they had Chihiro's handbook, they knew they had an easy way to dispose of it.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="106-Byakuya10.png"/>
   : I won't say it's not possible, but...who would have done something like that? I don't know of anyone who took their handbook into the sauna...

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="107-625.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Makoto20.png"/>
   : ...I might know someone who did.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Hifumi10.png"/>
   : Whoa, seriously?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-Makoto2.png"/>
   : I think the one who may have taken their handbook into the sauna was...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="108-Taka20.png"/>
   : Gh...! Nrgh!
   <br/>

   <i>
    Who might have brought their handbook into the sauna...? Really, it could have only been one person...!

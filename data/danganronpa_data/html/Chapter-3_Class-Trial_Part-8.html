   : It's basically a formality at this point, but once again you're totally correct! The blackened this time...the true killer who devised the whole stinkin' scheme, was...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Monokuma5.png"/>
   : Celestia Ludenburg! Or more precisely...Taeko Yasuhiroooo!

   : I lost... Well, that sucks. I guess trying to work with someone else was a mistake, after all. Hifumi's ineptitude was beyond all my calculations.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : So you really did approach Hifumi with this plan? But how did you get him to agree? I can't imagine he would have happily agreed to commit murder.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Byakuya.png"/>
   : I'm sure she relied on her specialty--lying.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Celeste3.png"/>
   : My specialty? Don't make me laugh. I didn't have to lie to get him to agree.

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Celeste15.png"/>
   : I knew you'd figure it out, Kyoko. You're absolutely right. To get Hifumi to act as my accomplice...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Celeste16.png"/>
   : ...I used "
   <b>
    her
   </b>
   ". For everyone who's still left, I'll avoid mentioning it by name, but it was the one thing Hifumi and Taka were both super into.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Makoto2.png"/>

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Monokuma8.png"/>
   : I'm totally out of the loop, as usual. How sad...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kyoko7.png"/>
   : Then you're the one that stole it?

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Celeste.png"/>
   : That's right.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : And you used it to drag Hifumi into the plan you'd come up with.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Celeste3.png"/>
   : Right again. Last night, after we had our meeting about how it'd disappeared, I paid Hifumi a little visit.

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Celeste8.png"/>
   : Hifumi agreed without a second thought. Hmhm. The effect that item had on him was...remarkable. The power of love... Even a love as twisted as that can still drive people mad, it would seem.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Hiro5.png"/>
   : You disgust me...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Byakuya9.png"/>
   : I have another question for you. Was that strange costume Hifumi's creation?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Celeste8.png"/>
   : Yeah. It was a real pain in the butt, too. All I asked him to do was make something to hide the face and general body size. I had no idea he'd make something like...that. But it's my fault for picking him in the first place.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-737.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Hiro5.png"/>
   : So...why'd you decide to make me the suspect?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Celeste2.png"/>
   : Because you're stupid.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Hiro7.png"/>
   : That's it!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Celeste9.png"/>
   : And in that regard, I made the right choice. I'm so glad your stupidity surpassed my every expectation.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Celeste4.png"/>
   : Life must have been tough on your parents, though.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-Hiro13.png"/>
   : I feel like I could cry...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-744.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Sakura3.png"/>
   : But when you were explaining your plan to Hifumi, how did you explain the part about him playing dead?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Byakuya.png"/>
   : What she's asking is, what was Hifumi supposed to do after that, assuming you had actually let him live?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-Celeste7.png"/>
   : That's simple. After he did his part and pretended to be dead, once someone showed up I told him to say he'd been seriously wounded, he was on the verge of death, but he just barely held on.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Hina2.png"/>
   : And he really believed that?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-748.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Celeste.png"/>
   : Well of course, that wasn't all there was to it. As I explained it to Hifumi, the plan was... while you were all questioning him about what had happened to him, I was going to murder someone else. At that point, Hifumi would have an alibi, so nobody could doubt him. I told him that, and he believed it.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Byakuya.png"/>
   : It all seems very...straightforward. Stereotypical.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Celeste9.png"/>
   : I just matched the lie to the level of the opponent. In fact, Hifumi ate it up. He believed the lie wholeheartedly, right up until the moment of his death.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Sakura5.png"/>
   : So you had planned to kill him all along!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Celeste4.png"/>
   : ...But of course. There would have been no point to my plan if the one who pretended to be dead did not end up dead himself.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-752.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-Hina16.png"/>
   : How can human life mean so little to you...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Celeste6.png"/>
   : That's a non-issue. I simply did everything in my power to win.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Hiro16.png"/>
   : Now you sound like Byakuya!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Celeste8.png"/>
   : No, he derives his pleasure from the thrill of the hunt. In that aspect, we are nothing alike.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-756.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-Kyoko13.png"/>
   : Then...what made you take things this far?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-Hina16.png"/>
   : Was it really...just for money?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Celeste8.png"/>
   : Are you talking about the ten million dollars Monokuma offered us? That *is* a lot of money, it's true.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Celeste2.png"/>
   : But that's not all there is to it. From the moment our new life here began, my only thought has been escape.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Hiro5.png"/>
   : B-But...all along you've been saying how we have to accept living here!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-758.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Celeste10.png"/>
   : Obviously that was a lie!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-Hiro8.png"/>
   : Hyah!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-Celeste10.png"/>
   : I couldn't take it! I hated it from day one! More than anyone anyone ANYONE else in here!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-760.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-Celeste11.png"/>
   : I wanted to get out! Every day was fresh torture! And do you wanna know why? HUH!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Celeste4.png"/>
   : Because...I had a dream. And accepting a life here would have meant nothing less than giving up on my dream forever...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Celeste15.png"/>
   : And there was no way...that I could ever do that. In the underground world of gambling, I risked my life to make a metaphorical killing.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Celeste5.png"/>
   : And it was all for that dream...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Makoto2.png"/>
   : And what was this dream of yours...?

   : And to gather handsome men from all over the world to server as my butlers-slash-bodyguards. I was going to make them dress up like vampires and satisfy my every need. Once I obtained that, I would have created a perfectly asthetic world of decadence... Living the rest of my life there was my only dream, my only goal... That's what life is all ABOUT!

   : Combined with my own winnings, Monokuma's ten million dollars would have made that dream a reality. I got right to the edge, but...

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Celeste15.png"/>

   : Are you asking me to feel guilty? That's a pointless endeavor. I think nothing of sacrificing others for my own ends. I feel nothing.

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Celeste4.png"/>
   : Hmph. My ability to lie is unrivaled, and I take pride in that. It's not just other people--I can even fool my own emotions. The conscious deceives the unconscious.

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Makoto2.png"/>

    Celeste smiled then... And when she did, it looked to me like a poor effort to force it. She claimed she could fool her own feelings. But that statement itself...must have been her final lie. And that weak, fake smile...is what betrayed her.

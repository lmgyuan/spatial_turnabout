   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto.png"/>
   : It's something you can't talk about in front of the surveillance cameras, right? So does that mean...? Does this have something to do with whatever it is you stole from Monokuma?
   <br/>

   : ...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto.png"/>
   : Monokuma told us earlier that someone had stolen something from him. Was it you...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : ...That's right.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto.png"/>
   : So I was right... But what did you steal?

   <i>
    But looking at it, I could tell it wasn't just any key. It was shaped like

     Monokuma

   <br/>
   <br/>

   "
   <br/>

   : So...Sakura broke into the headmaster's room for us?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kyoko13.png"/>
   : That's right. So that we could uncover whatever secrets might lay hidden within...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto.png"/>
   : She did that...for us...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    She violated the school regulations to help us. She'd already decided to die, so her last act was to defy the rules of this place...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : I noticed the room was open after the class trial was over yesterday. But if I'd just strolled into the room, Monokuma would have noticed right away. Which is why...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kyoko13.png"/>
   : ...I used you as a decoy.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto.png"/>
   : So you asked me to meet you at the data center in order to...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Kyoko.png"/>
   : Correct. I wanted you to draw Monokuma's attention. I took that opportunity to sneak into the headmaster's room. And as a result, I found this key.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto.png"/>
   : Wow... Then...what you told me about yesterday--did that come from the headmaster's room, too?

   <b>
    Mukuro Ikusaba
   </b>
   while you were in there?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : I did find a file in the headmaster's room that talked about her, yes. I don't know all the details yet, but...one thing I do know, is that Mukuro Ikusaba is
   <b>
    dangerous
   </b>
   .
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto.png"/>
   : D-Dangerous...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kyoko13.png"/>
   : She may very well be the mastermind.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto.png"/>
   : M-Mastermind!? But didn't Alter Ego say that the headmaster was probably the mastermind?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : No...the headmaster isn't the mastermind, I'm sure of that.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto.png"/>
   : What...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : I don't have proof yet, but I have no doubt I'm right.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    To make such a strong statement without proof... That's not like Kyoko at all. But...if it isn't the headmaster...does that mean Mukuro Ikusaba really could be the mastermind?

   <br/>

   : Anyway, this key is the one big opportunity we've been waiting to get our hands on. Now that we've grasped it, we can't let it go, can we?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto.png"/>
   : Sure, but I mean...what's this key even unlock?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : I don't know yet. Which is why...
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Wait, so you're planning on sneaking back in again? You can't! That's way too dangerous! And you want me to draw his attention, but we don't actually know there's just one mastermind, right? If there's more than one person watching us...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Kyoko12.png"/>
   : But they didn't catch on last night, right?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Maybe we just got lucky...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kyoko13.png"/>
   : Or maybe the mastermind can't monitor us and control Monokuma
   <b>

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Makoto2.png"/>
   : ...Huh?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : Like I said, we didn't get caught last night. But as you said, maybe it was pure luck.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Kyoko13.png"/>
   : Which is why we're going to run the experiment one more time. And if we're successful again...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kyoko15.png"/>
   : Then what may have just been a lucky guess will be proven true.

   : If it's true that the mastermind can't watch us and control Monokuma at the same time, then there would have to be a period of time where the mastermind is vulnerable. What we need to do is find out for sure it if that's actually true, and if we can exploit it.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Maybe, but... No matter what the reward, the risk is just too high. When I think what might happen if we fail...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : I don't think you need to worry all that much. After all...

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Makoto2.png"/>
   : But if the mastermind decides to do something, all the rules in the world won't matter. He could just kill us all without a second thought!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : I see... In that case, even if the plan fails, we'll still be able to prove or disprove that hypothesis.

   : What...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : In a moment of crisis, will the mastermind break their own rules, or adhere to them no matter what?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Kyoko17.png"/>

   : Not gonna talk, huh? Sure, I get it... Well, whatever. Unlike you, I have absolutely no interest in late-night bath scenes.

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Oh, well...you told us earlier that your precious had been stolen. What's this "precious" of yours?

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Monokuma2.png"/>
   : You gotta be kiddin' me! You gotta be 100-megaton freakin' KIDDING me! You're not gonna ask something useful, like how to get the best honey, or ursine breeding tips?

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-Makoto2.png"/>
   : What was that second thing...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Monokuma3.png"/>
   : It's a blank, stupid! A secret! Fill it in yourself! Making me trudge all the way out here for that... I'd like to see what's going on in that brain of yours!

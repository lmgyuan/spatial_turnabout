   : We have a Free Time to spend today. Once again, I spent some time at the School Store trying to get more presents. I still didn't manage to get the special present that triggers another small bonus scene. I have a feeling it's set to be a very, very rare present that isn't dependent on the actual Repeat % counter in the minigame. I've yet to see it show up for me on any playthrough I've done so far.

Plus, I wanted to do his events in Chapter 2 but he was too busy reading books for the entirety of it to do Free Times with. In case you've forgotten what his first event was, we did his first one in

   : But I don't rely on my family. Rather, I am my family's savior. The Togami Corporation reaches across the world, true, but I will take us to even greater heights. It is expected of me, naturally. After all, even my own family has recognized my ultimate superiority.
   <br/>

   : Battles...?

    I'd say it's a SUPER big deal!

   : 4 billion dollars is nothing to the Togami Corporation, but for personal use, it's not bad. So now you understand, right? I'm not merely the child of modern-day nobility.

   : So you're just gonna stand there, huh? Just wait for things to get better? Just take your time and get all depressed... Take the time to indulge your regrets... You might even start walking again without realizing it. Sure, that kind of mediocre thinking might work for some people.

   : You wanna know why I hate video games? You might not believe this, but I had a best friend once. Actually, he was my *only* friend. But unlike me, he had all kinds of friends. So me and him were at his house one day, when a big group of guys showed up to hang out. They'd just bought the latest big-budget video game. They sat there lost in the game, passing the controller back and forth, for hours. But not me... I just sat there watching. That's right, I just watched! What's wrong with that!? I didn't care! Just by watching, I was able to nail down all the best strategies! Even though I never actually played it! And I don't plan on ever playing it in the future, either!

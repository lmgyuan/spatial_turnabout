   : He had an extreme inferiority complex regarding his own
   <b>
    lack of strength
   </b>
   . "You're so weak,
   <b>
    even though you're a boy
   </b>
   !" He'd heard things like that as long as he could remember, and he couldn't overcome his weakness. On the contrary, he tried to hide and buried himself
   <b>
    further and further
   </b>
   into that weakness to take on the fragile form of a petite young girl. He had chosen that as his
   <b>
    way out
   </b>
   .
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-735.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Chihiro13.png"/>
   : Now nobody will be able to say anything about "even though you're a boy"...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Monokuma.png"/>
   : But no matter how tightly he wrapped himself up in that shell, the inferiority complex had already taken root deep inside of him, and was not so easily weeded out. As it turned out, the shell was completely empty. The complex didn't disappear. Instead, it only grew stronger and stronger.

   : Once the
   <b>
    killing game
   </b>
   had begun here at the school, he had no choice but to accept this fact. After all, this world is survival of the fittest. If you're not strong, you don't survive.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-740.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Monokuma.png"/>
   : And then the lovely and hateful Monokuma announced the revealing of the
   <b>
    embarrassing secrets
   </b>
   . Which, of course, included Chihiro's embarrassing secret, which I was more than willing to divulge...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   "
   <b>
    Even though he dresses like a girl, Chihiro is actually a boy
   </b>
   ."

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Monokuma8.png"/>
   : And that was something Chihiro couldn't let anyone find out, no matter the cost. If that was revealed, it would be the end. The hardened shell would crack, the armor would fall away. Without a doubt, those around him would torture him more than ever before. Everyone figured being thrust into such a dilemma must have sent him spiraling into despair.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Monokuma.png"/>
   : And yet...!
   <br/>

   : Um...s-sorry, I don't really want to talk about it right now.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Chihiro10.png"/>
   : But I also don't want to leave things the way they are. So maybe I can talk about it later... After I try my best...to become strong... Then I can tell everyone.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-746747.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Monokuma.png"/>
   : Annoyingly, he used the threat of discovery to motivate himself to become stronger!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Chihiro18.png"/>
   : Now's my chance... I'm going to get stronger...and accept who I am... Strong enough so that when someone says "even though you're a boy" I'll be okay. I'll get better!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Monokuma.png"/>
   : With that thought at the front of his mind, he resolved to take immediate action. And so...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-FlashT.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-748.png"/>

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-FlashB.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Monokuma.png"/>
   : That day, he made the committment to begin exercising. He was prepared to retrain his mind and body. But sadly... That would be the first and only chance he would get at it!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-749.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Monokuma.png"/>
   : When he'd decided to start exercising, he thought it would be good to ask for someone's help. But he wanted to tell that person his secret first, and then ask them to help him from there. And the person he went to...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-750.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Mondo17.png"/>
   : It was me...!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Monokuma5.png"/>
   : Yup, it sure was!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Monokuma4.png"/>
   : The biker gang fella had been painfully clear about how important his
   <b>
    manly promises
   </b>
   were. So Chihiro probably figured that even if he confided in Mondo, his honor would make him keep the secret.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Mondo15.png"/>
   : ...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Monokuma.png"/>
   : Plus, Mr. Macho Mondo was the very symbol of a
   <b>
    strong man
   </b>
   that Chihiro had always aspired to.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-755.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Chihiro18.png"/>
   : Maybe talking to Mondo about it will help give me some courage...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Monokuma.png"/>
   : So he went and asked Mondo to help him become strong!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Monokuma8.png"/>
   : That was his aspiration... And he thought that only with Mondo's support would he ever be able to come close to that.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-757.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : So then, that must be why Mondo
   <b>
    did what he did
   </b>
   --to keep the promise he'd made to Chihiro.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Huh? Did what he did? You mean...? That's why Mondo carried Chihiro from the boys locker room into the girls locker room?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-Kyoko.png"/>
   : Yes, that's exactly what I mean.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Hifumi2.png"/>
   : Wasn't that to cover up what he'd done?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Kyoko3.png"/>
   : That could have been part of it, but I don't think it was the main reason. The real purpose was to keep the
   <b>
    promise between men
   </b>
   he'd made to Chihiro.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-761.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-Hina9.png"/>
   : But...how does moving the body keep his secret?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Kyoko13.png"/>
   : Because if everyone knew he'd been killed in the boys locker room then everyone would have been arguing about how "she" got into the *boys* locker room, right? Once that started up, at least a few of us would have immediately begun to suspect his identity. So, he tried to protect Chihiro's secret by putting him in the girls locker room and stealing his handbook. See?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Then...Mondo did all that to keep the promise he'd made to Chihiro...who he'd also killed?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Mondo17.png"/>
   : ...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-764.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-Taka20.png"/>
   : Why...would he...do that?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Taka6.png"/>
   : The more I hear you talk, the more I don't understand! I mean, you guys trusted each other, right!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Taka5.png"/>
   : So why? Why did you...?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-763.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Mondo17.png"/>
   : ... Because...no matter what, I didn't want anyone to know...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : So that's what triggered it, after all.

   : Mondo's older brother was his only family growing up. He was the only one Mondo could trust, or respect. He wanted to measure up to his big brother, so he imitated him in everything he did. Mondo was the epitome of the starry-eyed kid brother.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Monokuma.png"/>
   : Meanwhile, the charismatic older brother had put together a local motorcycle gang...and before anyone knew it, it had grown into the biggest biker gang in the country. Daiya, the older brother, number one in the gang. And his number two, his younger brother, Mondo. In the beginning, everything was peaches and gravy. But when Mondo started to think about how he would have to take over the gang from his brother someday his brother's greatness, his reputation, began to gnaw on Mondo's very soul!

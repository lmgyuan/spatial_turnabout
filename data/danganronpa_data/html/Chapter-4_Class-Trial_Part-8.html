   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Sakura14.png"/>
   : My good friend Hina. There's something I have to tell you. I hate to do it like this, but you need to know. This is...my final wish.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Sakura14.png"/>
   : As you know, I've been giving information to the one who's imprisoned you here. It was our first night in this strange school that the mastermind came to see me... You see, the mastermind took control of
   <b>
    my family's dojo
   </b>
   , and demanded I become their tool. You might not see the importance of a dojo, but my family has watched over it for over 300 years. I couldn't let it be destroyed under my watch. So even if it meant my own life, I had to protect it. That's how I saw things...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Sakura14.png"/>
   : However, that was my
   <b>
    greatest weakness
   </b>
   . And because of that, I made the mistake of giving in to the mastermind. And what the mastermind wanted from me was nothing less...than
   <b>
    murder
   </b>
   . They were probably worried that until the first murder had happened, nothing would move forward. But what neither the mastermind nor I expected...was the incident involving Sayaka. At that point, the plan changed. The mastermind told me to hold off--to wait until we reached another stalemate.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Sakura14.png"/>
   : However, as I lived here with all of you... As I lived here with Hina...my resolve began to weaken. Watching everyone fight with such despair, trying so desperately to stay alive...I saw the weakness in my own heart, the mistake of succumbing to the mastermind. And more than anything...I cannot betray those who would call me
   <b>
    their friend
   </b>
   . That's how I came to feel.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="72-0882.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Makoto2.png"/>

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-FlashT.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="73-0883.png"/>

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-FlashB.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-Sakura13.png"/>

   <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Monokuma4.png"/>
   : Of course, because of that I decided to reveal her secret, which made everyone else hate her. Her decision to stay true to all of you led directly to all of you hating her for it...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-Monokuma5.png"/>
   : Ironic, isn't it!? Or maybe oxymoronic? Or just moronic...?

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Sakura14.png"/>
   : Of course, I understand if you all hate me. All of this is because of my own weakness... I'm perfectly willing to accept whatever attack you may want to make on me. So this is my atonement for betraying you. That's what I had in mind... But unfortunately, that's not enough. This won't end with just me accepting your hatred.

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Sakura14.png"/>

   <br/>

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Sakura14.png"/>
   : My betrayal brought suspicion, disharmony... The mastermind knew that eventually it would escalate into someone murdering someone else.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="77-0886.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Sakura14.png"/>
   : Of course, I'm still responsible for that, as well. I have an obligation to get this situation under control. And to fulfill that obligation, I've decided to do as the mastermind has commanded. I will do as I was told, and
   <b>
    commit murder
   </b>
   . But I've decided... The one I'm going to kill is...
   <b>
    myself
   </b>
   .
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Sakura14.png"/>
   : If the mastermind demands that I kill someone, then that someone will be me. Then my dojo will be safe, and above all else, none of you will have to kill anyone. When I die, the source of conflict among you all died with me. For that, I'm willing to give up my life.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Sakura14.png"/>
   : If it can save you, then sacrificing my own life could have no greater meaning. Whatever you think of me, please know that you all are my most treasured friends... I've never had people like you in my life...

   : Then...Sakura...didn't feel cornered. She didn't die hating us. She wanted to...stop us from fighting? To
   <b>
    protect us
   </b>
   ?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : She didn't end her own life because she was weak. Quite the opposite, in fact...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-Kyoko7.png"/>
   : She was
   <b>
    strong
   </b>
   . *Too* strong. That's why she killed herself. She chose death for herself in order to protect the rest of us. To sacrifice so much... No normal person could do that.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-Kyoko13.png"/>
   : It was only her limitless strength that made it possible.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Hina13.png"/>
   : ...

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Sakura14.png"/>
   : Finally...Hina, I want to apologize to you especially. The reason I didn't tell you any of this is because I knew you would try to stop me. I'm really, truly sorry. But please don't be sad. If I can thwart the mastermind's plans, if I can keep you from killing each other...that's enough for me.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Sakura14.png"/>
   : This is the path that I have chosen. This is the only way I have left to distinguish myself. And you can use this note to bring the class trial to a quick end. I'm sorry to ask you to do something to unpleasant, but I have to leave the rest to you. Please talk to Byakuya, Toko, and Hiro on my behalf. I can't tell anyone about my plan while I'm alive, but I wanted you to understand why I'm doing this. In the end, though, I hope to show myself through actions and not words. Hopefully then they'll see...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Sakura14.png"/>
   : I never saw you as my enemy. You were only ever my friend, who I wanted to help as much as possible... Hina...whatever it takes, survive. Survive along with everyone else. No matter what...just survive.

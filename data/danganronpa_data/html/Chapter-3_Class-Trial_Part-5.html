    small scrap of paper
   </b>
   . If I'm right about this, the
   <b>
    sheet of paper
   </b>
   this piece came from is...

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Makoto23.png"/>

   with the note we found hidden on Hifumi!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Hina9.png"/>

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Makoto29.png"/>
   : Yup. They're from the same piece of paper.
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : Hifumi had the note meant for Taka, while Taka's corpse still grasped a small piece of that note... There's only one way to explain it...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-Sakura4.png"/>
   : Taka died clutching the note. Hifumi tried to free the note from his death grip leaving behind only one small scrap. Did I get all that right?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Byakuya5.png"/>
   : That means Hifumi knew the note was important...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Kyoko13.png"/>
   : Exactly. Which proves that he was an accomplice in the murder.
   <br/>

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Sakura.png"/>
   : Whoever did is the mastermind...the
   <b>
    true killer
   </b>
   .
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : He was killed in the
   <b>
    repository
   </b>
   , so he must have been killed not long after transporting Taka's body.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Sakura.png"/>
   : So he must have been killed after Taka's body vanished but before we found both bodies in the repository...
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Byakuya.png"/>
   : During that time, we'd all split up and were searching for Taka's missing body.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Byakuya3.png"/>
   : In other words, during that time...none of us have alibis.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Hina9.png"/>
   : Wait, but me and Sakura were together!
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Hiro16.png"/>
   : Anyway, when they were killed bothers me too, but there's something that's been bothering me even more!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Celeste8.png"/>
   : And what might that be?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Hiro12.png"/>
   : The
   <b>
    weapon
   </b>
   they used to kill Hifumi!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Sakura3.png"/>
   : The weapon...?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-408.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Hiro12.png"/>
   : Yeah, cuz I mean...according to the Monokuma File... The way Taka and Hifumi were killed was almost the same, with them having similar fractures and all...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Hiro2.png"/>
   : But Justice Hammer 3 and 4 were still laying around in the nurse's office and equipment room, right?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-410.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Hiro2.png"/>
   : So if Hifumi was killed in the repository, the culprit woulda had to grab one of the hammers, kill Hifumi, then
   <b>
    put the hammer back
   </b>
   where they found it.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Hiro12.png"/>
   : But wouldn't that be seriously risky for 'em?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Byakuya7.png"/>
   : ...I'm surprised. It seems there's some semblance of a brain knocking around that skull of yours, after all.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Hiro16.png"/>
   : Hell yeah, it's packed in there good and tight!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-414.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Sakura3.png"/>
   : He's right, though. I don't understand it, either. The Monokuma File makes it clear that they were killed using similar instruments... But if the hammers were already laying around those other rooms...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Celeste8.png"/>
   : So the question is, how could the culprit have gotten their hands on either of the hammers? Personally, I haven't a clue.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Hina21.png"/>
   : So which hammer was used to attack Celeste? Number one or number two!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Makoto24.png"/>
   : Those were accounted for in other rooms, too. And I don't think either one is big enough to kill someone.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Hina9.png"/>
   : Um...then, uhh...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-419.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-Byakuya9.png"/>
   : ...Is it not possible they used a different weapon?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Hiro15.png"/>
   : I don't think is *is* possible! They were both killed with the same kinda thing, right?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Sakura.png"/>
   : So then,
   <b>
    what was used
   </b>
   to kill Hifumi...?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    The weapon that was actually used to kill Hifumi... The whole picture surrounding this case won't become clear until we figure that out. Somehow, I have to find the truth!

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-Celeste7.png"/>
   : Well, whatever it was, there's one thing we have to figure out. How was the culprit able to move around so freely with the weapon? How did nobody
   <b>
    witness
   </b>
   them carrying it?
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-Hiro12.png"/>

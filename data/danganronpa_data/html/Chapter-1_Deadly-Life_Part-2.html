    For who knows how long...nobody said a word. The fact that Sayaka and Junko were dead was a huge shock, of course. But there was more to it than that. It was also the idea that one of us had actually
    <b>
     murdered someone
    </b>
    ...and that if we didn't find out who it was, we would
    <b>
     all
    </b>
    die here.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    We'd found ourselves in a situation where we couldn't help but look at each other with open suspicion. It was the worst situation imaginable. And yet, even in such a perversly terrible situation...she didn't show the slightest hint that it had gotten to her.

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Kyoko2.png"/>
   : Now's no time to wallow in your depression. The worst thing we can do right now is lose all faith in each other. That would lead to the same disastrous result as having *total* faith in everyone else.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Leon7.png"/>
   : Huh...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Kyoko.png"/>
   : Cooperation is absolutely key at this point. Who you decide to trust or not trust is, of course, up to you.

   <br/>

   : S-Saying stuff like that is just--!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Celeste2.png"/>
   : How many times have I told you? Anyone who can't adapt...will die. Death is the only thing awaiting those who are unable or unwilling to adapt.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Celeste4.png"/>
   : If that happens, you only have yourself to blame.
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-Hina15.png"/>
   : What an awful thing to say! Especially after what's happened!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Kyoko2.png"/>
   : Right now, exposing the killer is the most important thing. Because if we don't, we're all going to die here.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Byakuya3.png"/>
   : ...She's right. We need to begin our search right away.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-099.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Sakura5.png"/>
   : Either way, we can't run away from the situation, so we have no choice but to move forward.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Hina16.png"/>
   : We just hafta do it, I guess. What other choice do we have?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Leon6.png"/>
   : No way in hell am I letting someone kill me...! Alright, dammit! Let's do this!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    We just have to do it... Everyone kept repeating that sentiment. They were using it like a mantra to give themselves strength. But they're right. We just have to do this. No matter how much we don't want to, we have no choice. If that's what it takes to survive, then that's what we have to do!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On top of that, there was something I needed to find out... I had to know why Sayaka had to die. Why she had to be the one... I'm terrified to find out, but still...I have to know. Otherwise, I knew I'd never be able to accept her death. Which is why...I don't have any choice! I have to do this!

    I gently placed my hand on Junko's lifeless body... I touched her wrists to check for a pulse, like they do in movies and stuff, but...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Makoto2.png"/>
   : ...She...really is dead.

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Byakuya3.png"/>
   : I don't know why you even bothered to check. After those injuries, and losing that much blood... Frankly, I'd be shocked if she *did* survive something like that.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Hiro5.png"/>
   : H-Huh...? H-Hold on...

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Toko12.png"/>
   : You're j-just now accepting that...?

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Kyoko2.png"/>
   : Before we start searching for Sayaka's killer, we need to decide what to do about securing the crime scene.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Makoto2.png"/>
   : What do you mean...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Byakuya.png"/>
   : You're thinking of putting someone on
   <b>
    guard duty
   </b>
   so nobody can disturb the area, aren't you? After all, if the culprit decides to destroy the evidence, we're pretty much screwed.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-113.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Mondo12.png"/>
   : In that case, I don't mind doing it. I don't like havin' to think, anyway. I'll let you guys figure out who killed that chick.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Hina2.png"/>
   : Okay, then we can let Mondo look after the scene.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-115.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Byakuya3.png"/>
   : Well, no...we can't just leave him there alone.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Mondo5.png"/>
   : What? Why the hell not!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Byakuya7.png"/>
   : Isn't it obvious? If you were the culprit, what's the first thing you would do? By volunteering for guard duty, you're in a position to destroy all the evidence you want.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Mondo9.png"/>
   : Wh--!? Fuck you!
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Sakura.png"/>
   : Fine, then I'll stay there on guard duty as well. That way there's no problem.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Hifumi3.png"/>
   : 2-player co-op base defense with the two of them... With their stats, they're totally OP!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Sakura.png"/>
   : Since we won't be able to help investigate, we're putting out faith in the rest of you.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Hina2.png"/>
   : I'm still pretty freaked out, but...I'll try.

   : Huh? Noticed what?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Celeste.png"/>

   <b>
    Makoto's dorm

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    All at once, everyone's gaze turned to me.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Makoto2.png"/>
   : H-Hold on a second! You've got it all wrong! F-For just one night, I...I traded rooms with her. I did it because...she was afraid.

   : Y-You expect us to b-believe that? Just tell us the t-truth!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    The look in everyone's eyes had done a complete 180 from just a few minutes earlier. The feeling of suspicion and fear had returned. In other words... Y-You think *I* did it!?
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-130.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-Kyoko13.png"/>
   : Are we all done talking? We need to begin our investigation soon. At this point, we should split up. We need to get to the bottom of this and find out who killed Sayaka. We'll have to collect clues to form a foundation, then construct an argument to come to a final decision. If we get this wrong...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : Well, do I really have to say any more?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Hifumi19.png"/>
   : I'd rather you didn't, no...
   <br/>

   <i>
    With that, Kyoko hurried out of the gym.

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Sakura.png"/>
   : Ah, that's right.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-137.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-Mondo5.png"/>
   : ...Lemme just say this right now! If whatever son of a bitch did this is here right now, and they're thinking of destroying that evidence...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Mondo7.png"/>
   : They'd better not let me find 'em! I'll skip the trial and cave their goddamn skull in myself! I'm serious! I will fuck them up!

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-Toko.png"/>
   : We don't r-really have to do anything in p-particular. W-We already know who k-killed Sayaka...

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="71-Hifumi2.png"/>
   : That's true. We may as well at least check just to check.

   : Welcome to the Investigation! We must now explore the crime scene and the school finding clues called Truth Bullets that we can use as evidence to prove our innocence and figure out who is guilty.  The trial will not begin until we have found all the Truth Bullets so there's no worry of entering a trial unprepared. Inspect everything you think is relevant to the murder and you'll find the Truth Bullets with little trouble. Let's begin with the first Truth Bullet before I end the update.

    "The victim was Sayaka Maizono. The time of death is estimated to be around 1:30 a.m. The body was discovered in Makoto's room, in the dormitory. All evidence suggests that the death took place in the bathroom. The cause of death was a stab wound to the abdomen. There was also an injury to her right wrist. Specifically, the wrist appears to have suffered a fracture."

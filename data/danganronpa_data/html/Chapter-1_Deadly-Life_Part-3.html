   : Let's start by talking to Mr. Non-believer over here.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-153.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Hiro6.png"/>
   : Ugh...no way. I seriously don't wanna die here!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Hiro11.png"/>
   : I'm begging you! God, Buddha, Mother Earth, God of Space, King Neptune! Help me! I don't care who it is, just get me outta here!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Hiro doesn't seem prepared to do any kind of investigating right now...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-155.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-156.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Aren't you going to help investigate, Chihiro?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Chihiro10.png"/>
   : But...I can't leave Junko here. I-I feel sorry for her... I...I have to stay with her.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Narration.png"/>
   : That's all we can do in the gym for now.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-157.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    First of all, I should head to the scene of the crime--
    <b>
     my room
    </b>
    . We won't make any progress without investigating there.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-158.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So I headed to my room, where Sayaka's corpse still remained.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-159.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I'd better examine the state of my room a little closer. That might reveal something new.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Narration.png"/>
   : The bedroom sure is a mess.  This means there are a lot of things to examine in here.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-161.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-160.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Huh? Looking at the lint roller, it looks like there's way less than there was before. Did Sayaka see how dirty my room was and decide to clean up a little...?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-162.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-163.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This is the replica sword I brought back for self-defense. Does this mean it was used in the attack somehow? And plus, it's been
    <b>
     taken out of its sheath
    </b>
    . I hadn't actually looked at the blade itself till now. I shouldn't be surprised it's coated in gold, too.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Makoto2.png"/>
   : On top of that...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Some of the gold coating has come off of parts of the blade, and the handle. Yeah, the handle especially is missing a lot of its coating. I remember the coating sticks to you even if you just touch it a little bit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-164.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-165.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-166.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There's a key on the ground... It has my name on it, so this must be my room key. If I remember correctly...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-FlashT.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-167.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-FlashB.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Sayaka6.png"/>
   : Ah, that's right. We'll have to trade keys.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-168.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    When we switched rooms, we switched keys, too. So Sayaka would have had the key here in my room the entire time.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Makoto2.png"/>
   : But wait, if that's true, then how did the killer get into the room in the first place?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Could Sayaka have forgotten to lock the door? No, that seems impossible...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-FlashT.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="26-169.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-FlashB.png"/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Makoto2.png"/>
   : The same goes for you, Sayaka. No matter who it is, don't open your door for anyone.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-Sayaka6.png"/>
   : Even if I'm sure it's you, I absolutely won't open it. Otherwise, what's the point of even switching?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="25-168.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    After saying that, there's no way she would have forgotten to lock it, or opened it for any reason.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Well, maybe she dropped the key somewhere, and someone else grabbed it or something.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    No, that's not possible either. Sayaka was in here when we switched rooms. And with how scared she was, she wouldn't have gone walking around. So she couldn't have dropped it. So how did the killer...?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-170.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-171.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-172.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    There are scratches and gouges on my walls and bed.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Is that evidence of a struggle?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    It looks like there must have been some kind of
    <b>
     fight
    </b>
    in my room...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Dammit! I was right there in the other room! If only I'd heard something!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-173.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Sakura4.png"/>
   : That would not have been possible.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Huh?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-174.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Sakura3.png"/>
   : Don't you remember? All of our rooms are completely soundproof. So something could happen in the room right next to you, and there's no way you could know.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Sakura4.png"/>
   : Perhaps this was another of Monokuma's strategies, creating an ideal setting for murder.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Makoto2.png"/>
   : ...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-175.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-179.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Narration.png"/>
   : Speaking of Sakura, let's see what she thinks about the situation.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-180.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Sakura, do *you* think I'm guilty, too?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-181.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Sakura7.png"/>
   : I try not to make assumptions like that. I simply don't know whether or not you did this.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-Sakura6.png"/>
   : Whatever decision the rest of you come up with, I will follow your lead.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Makoto2.png"/>
   : I see.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="40-176.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-177.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    This is the replica sword I brought back for self-defense. Does this mean it was used in the attack somehow? And plus, the sword's been taken out, so it's just the sheath, but...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Huh?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    There's some scratches on the sheath. They must've been make with something sharp.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Makoto2.png"/>
   : But how'd the sheath get scratched up in the first place?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Even if someone used the sword during the struggle, it doesn't make sense for the sheath to be damaged. I mean, if you're gonna attack someone with a sword, the first thing you'd do is unsheathe it. A heavy sheath like this would only get in the way. It could just slide off in the middle of the fight. So why are there scratches on the sheath?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-178.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-183.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-184.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The toolkit is still inside the drawer. I don't see any evidence that it's been used at all.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Which makes sense, I guess. I mean, it's mine, and I haven't had any reason to open it. I can't even imagine a situation where I'd need a toolkit like this.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-185.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Mondo12.png"/>
   : Yeah, seriously!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Oh, Mondo...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Mondo12.png"/>
   : We ain't exactly in the mood to be buildin' fuckin' furniture, right?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Makoto2.png"/>
   : So you haven't used yours either, then?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-186.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Mondo2.png"/>
   : Not just me. Nobody's busted theirs out yet, far as I know. Actually, we were talkin' about it yesterday.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Mondo.png"/>
   : None of the guys have opened their toolkits yet. Cuz like, why the hell would we?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-188.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-189.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Narration.png"/>
   : Mondo had some good information, let's see if he can think of anything else.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-190.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Mondo12.png"/>
   : Ya know, I realized something while I was on guard duty. The killer could've already destroyed some evidence, right? Before anyone found the body, I mean. There's a
   <b>
    trash room
   </b>
   here in the dorms, right? They coulda tossed some stuff in there.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Y-Yeah, that's definitely possible.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-192.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-Mondo6.png"/>
   : That dirty bastard!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-Mondo8.png"/>
   : Anyone who raises their hand to a woman is scum that deserves death. That's what my brother taught me.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Mondo7.png"/>
   : So if I ever find the son of a bitch that did this, I'm gonna pound his goddamn face in.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Makoto2.png"/>
   : B-But what if it was a girl that did it?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-194.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Mondo.png"/>
   : ...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-Mondo3.png"/>
   : That'll all get sorted out when the time comes.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Narration.png"/>
   : The trash room, huh? We'll have to visit there later. For now, someone else is in the room too.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-196.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-197.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Hey, Kyoko...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    I quietly called her name while she was investigating the area. But...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-198.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Makoto9.png"/>
   : What are you doing?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Kyoko23.png"/>
   : Isn't it obvious?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Makoto9.png"/>
   : N-No, not really.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Kyoko23.png"/>
   : I'm searching.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Makoto9.png"/>
   : Searching?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    She was down on her knees, carefully inspecting every inch of my room.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-Makoto9.png"/>
   : Did you lose a contact or something?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Kyoko23.png"/>
   : ...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    I dunno what she's going exactly, but she seems to be concentrating pretty hard on it.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-199.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    But a few seconds later, she suddenly stood up straight and said...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Kyoko12.png"/>
   : Are you a clean freak?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Huh? N-No, I don't think so. But what...?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Nodding, she glanced around my room one more time.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="66-200.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="67-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : Interesting...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    What's interesting?
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Kyoko12.png"/>
   : Just as I suspected, there's something
   <b>
    [very unusual]
   </b>
   about your room.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <b>
    &gt; very unusual
   </b>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Unusual? What do you mean?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="68-201.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : I've searched your floor from one corner to another and I didn't find one single strand of hair.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Really?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : Not one hair from the victim, and not one hair from you, even though you've been living in here.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Makoto2.png"/>
   : You know, now that you mention it, I noticed something while I was looking around before. It looked like the lint roller in my room had been used, but I never touched it. Could someone have used it to...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="65-Kyoko12.png"/>
   : Very interesting. Your room didn't have a single hair in it, and someone used your lint roller without your knowledge. In other words, someone other than you came in and scrubbed your room clean.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Makoto2.png"/>

   : Sayaka...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    All at once I was overcome with dizziness, nausea, the urge to burst into tears... But I can't...I can't hesitate now. Why? Why did Sayaka have to die? I have to uncover the truth. I have to find out what happened!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I wanted to give up, I wanted to collapse. But that thought held me up and supported me.

   : But now's no time to think like that!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    I pulled out the Monokuma File to verify what it said about her body.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-209.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Some sort of
   <b>
    sharp object
   </b>
   has been thrust into her stomach. That must've been the killing blow. But whatever they used to kill her, where'd they get it? That's definitely something I should look into later.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Also according to the Monokuma File, Sayaka's right wrist is broken.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-210.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Her wrist does look swollen and bloody, that's for sure. But there's something sorta glittery there on her wrist, too.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Right there, where he wrist is all swollen, there's something glittery. That definitely concerns me.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Another thing that concerns me is...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-211.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Huh? There's some blood on her left index finger, but that's it. The palms of both her hands are totally spotless, so how come only her left finger...?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-212.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The stab wound in her stomach is what killed her, so when she broke her wrist... That must have happened earlier on. I mean, how would her wrist get broken after she'd already been killed? So it's very possible she broke her wrist during the struggle. The killer attacked Sayaka in the main room, which is when her wrist got broken. After that, the killer cornered her in the bathroom where they inflicted the deadly wound.

   <b>
    [dying message]

   : ...Do you often talk like an aspiring poet?

   ... I have no idea what that could possibly mean.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="69-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : The way she wrote the numbers makes me think she wanted to use her body to block them. If she wrote them in that location, while she was sitting the way we found her, it means she must have wrote them by
   <b>
    turning only her hand toward the wall
   </b>
   . If you were to write something in that position, do you know what the result would be?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Makoto2.png"/>

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Makoto2.png"/>

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Yeah, I guess I'm the only one, but the door doesn't fit in the frame quite right. When I first tried to use it, I thought it was just locked. But once you learn the trick, it opens no problem.

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-Kyoko13.png"/>
   : So what you're saying is, only you and Sayaka knew about it. Hmm... Interesting...

    I still don't really understand any of this, but I've already given my room a good once-over. Maybe I should look around somewhere else. I should start looking into where the murder weapon might have come from. And also, I should look into the DVD Sayaka got. With Sayaka dead, I have no choice but to see for myself what was in that video. And on top of that, I'm sure there are some other areas worth checking out, too. Maybe I should see what everyone else think. If they'll even talk to me, that is...

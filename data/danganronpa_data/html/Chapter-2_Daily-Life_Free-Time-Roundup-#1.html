   : People have been asking me how I plan to do Free Times that I miss in the main playthrough. My plan is to show off Free Times for dead characters as best I can through the use of the postgame School Mode and a different save file. There are, however, a few hiccups with this plan:
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-Narration.png"/>
   : First, the School Mode is only accessible from a cleared game file. You must see the credits roll to access it. Second, it tracks what Free Time events you saw as you played so that it doesn't show you duplicates if you talk to characters again. Third, it appears to choose random room backdrops for the conversations to take place in, meaning that it will spoil areas of the game we have not yet seen. Because of these issues, I may choose to backload more and more of these Free Times towards the end of the LP to avoid spoilers. Additionally, because the save file I'm using is the file I played to casually play the game my first time, a bunch of Free Time Events are already viewed and as such, can no longer be viewed through School Mode. I'll have to figure out how I want to view those events in the future. I may have to start up a 3rd file to be able to view certain character's events. I will try my best to work around these restrictions to show off the Free Time Events throughout the LP instead of all at the end.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-Narration.png"/>
   : The entirety of School Mode and its mechanics will be explained at the end of the LP when I probably show it off for an update or two. Don't forget, any Free Times seen in this School Mode are not happening in the actual LP save file, meaning I won't be getting the Skills and Skill Points shown off here for use in the actual LP. They're just bonuses for players who want to replay their save file and maybe try out new skills and harder difficulties.

   : First up on our Free Time event roundup is Sayaka. As it turns out, Sayaka only has one more Free Time event that we didn't see. Most other characters will have between 3 and 6 events in total but she only has 2. Her previous Free Time was in

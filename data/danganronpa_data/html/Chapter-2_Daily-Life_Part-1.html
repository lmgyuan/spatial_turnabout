    I didn't even have time to mourn Sayaka and Junko's deaths... I'm sure that's exactly why he did it. It's a bad joke, a sickening dream... But I have to accept the reality of it all... I headed back to the dining hall to meet up with the others.

    took over Hope's Peak

   , which was supposed to be well defended, then modified it to fit their desire. They created Monokuma, which seems to be incredibly advanced, and they're providing for our every need. And the cherry on top is the
   <b>
    execution
   </b>
   we witnessed.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Celeste7.png"/>
   : Everything has been planned down to the last excruciating detail. This is not the work of your everyday psychopath. Defying them may be too great a risk...

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-Byakuya2.png"/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Hifumi3.png"/>
   : She's right. If you heap that kind of blame on yourself, you'll turn into a full-fledged masochist.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-Chihiro8.png"/>
   : ...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Chihiro, listen... You're not to blame. Not you, not Leon, and not Sayaka. The mastermind is responsible for everything that's happened. We had no choice but to vote. I can't even imagine what would've happened to us if we'd refused. And in the end, it was Monokuma who ultimately killed Leon! So don't waste your anger on yourself... Instead, direct it at the mastermind!

    nighttime
   </b>
   . Soon the doors to the dining hall will be locked, and entry at that point is strictly prohibited. Oh, and one other thing... It was totally obvious before that you were trying to make yourselves feel better and justify what you did. See you, see you, don't see you, see you! That's about how much I can see you, even when you try to hide!

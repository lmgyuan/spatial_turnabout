   : I murder with passion and conviction! I consider myself a professional, and I have a very particular way of doing things! Imagine you go to a fancy Italian restaurant. They're very picky about the noodles, the sauce, everything. But what happened to Chihiro... It'd be like if that same Italian restaurant started using Ragu or Chef Boyardee! This is no creation of mine!

   : Let me rephrase that, in a way that maybe makes more sense...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Makoto2.png"/>
   : There are two clear differences between the Genocide Jack cases and this one.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    There's one clear difference between the murders...

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Makoto28.png"/>
   : For one, the
   <b>
    cause of death
   </b>
   is different. In the Genocide Jack murders, all the victims were killed the same way. According to the case file, they were all apparently killed with...a pair of scissors. But Chihiro died from
   <b>
    a blow to the head
   </b>
   , right?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Hifumi18.png"/>
   : Ah, yes! That is remarkably different from the other murders!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="27-Makoto28.png"/>
   : Wouldn't it be strange for someone who kills the same way without fail to suddenly change their method?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Makoto25.png"/>
   : And there's more--one more conflicting detail.

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Jill6.png"/>

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Hiro14.png"/>
   : Could you please stop comparing killing people to cooking...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Taka16.png"/>
   : S-So...are you saying the other difference has to do with how the body was arranged...?
   <br/>

   : What is your point?

   : ...Huh?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Jill10.png"/>
   : My word! You really didn't notice? Take a look at who the victims were in each Genocide Jack case... There's a

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Hmm...let's see... There was a pattern surrounding the Genocide jack victims, and Chihiro didn't fit it...? I...I think I figured it out! I know why she couldn't have killed Chihiro...!

   ...it's possible you could have found out, isn't it? You'd have no problem gaining access to classified government documents or internal police records. Plus, you'd already looking through the Genocide Jack file before this all happened, hadn't you?
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="64-Hifumi10.png"/>
   : A-Are you saying...Mr. Togami did it?

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-Celeste16.png"/>
   : Then the reason he pushed the theory of
   <b>
    Genocide Jack being the killer
   </b>
   so hard was because he wanted to pin the crime on her!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Jill9.png"/>
   : So he rearranged the scene to disguise it and make it look like I'd put my stamp on it...!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="75-239.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-Jill11.png"/>
   : The adorable glasses man was behind it all!? Ahh, I'm on fire!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="77-Taka8.png"/>
   : ...Well, Byakuya!? What's your response!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-Byakuya3.png"/>
   : I see... So now the suspicion falls on me. Then I must ask...when would you say I began acting suspicious? Surely you must have an answer...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Makoto25.png"/>
   : Hmm, looking back and thinking about it now, the way you were acting right before we discovered the body was a little strange...
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="80-Byakuya9.png"/>
   : And the locker rooms... They're suspicious. Very suspicious, indeed. Wouldn't you agree?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Huh? Suspicious...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-Byakuya4.png"/>
   : It seems nobody's searched the locker rooms. Let's start with the girls locker room...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="82-245.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-Makoto2.png"/>
   : You wanted to go to the girls locker room right away, right? But since you're a guy...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-Byakuya3.png"/>
   : I should have naturally thought of the boys locker room first. Is that what you want to say?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="83-247.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-Byakuya5.png"/>
   : The victim was Chihiro. A girl. Hence why I said we should check the girls locker room.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="85-Hifumi.png"/>
   : Nothing strange about that, I'd say!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="86-249.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="87-Makoto20.png"/>
   : On the contrary, there's something *very* strange!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="78-Byakuya3.png"/>
   : Okay then, what's so strange about it?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="81-Byakuya4.png"/>
   : Go ahead, share with the rest of the class.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    There was a clear contradiction in what Byakuya just said... I need to make it clear to everyone...!
   </i>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="89-Tutorial.png"/>
   : Next we're going to add something called a
   <b>
    Truth Flashback
   </b>
   . If you aim and a weak spot and hold down the Triangle button then you'll
   <b>
    memorize
   </b>
   that weak spot. This memorized phrase can only be shot once as a single Truth Bullet. If you shoot or change the Truth Bullet, it will disappear from your Truth Cylinder. However, you can use this flashback feature as many times as you want. If you don't seem to have the answer to a
   <b>
    lie or contradiction
   </b>
   in your loaded Truth Bullets it might be wise to memorize a different weak spot and use that to make your case. When's the best time to flashback? Well, you'll just have to use your keen wits, won't you?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Narration.png"/>
   : I think this is the last mechanic in the Nonstop Debate. Like the tutorial said, you can use this mechanic to use a weak point that someone says and turn it into a Truth Bullet you can use to break through a different weak point. This debate introduces the mechanic so it's not too difficult to do but later cases will get tougher. There's also no indication of when you want to use a memorized statement instead of your loaded bullets so you have to be very aware of what bullets you have. While that sounds potentially unfair, the good thing is that you won't need to use this mechanic in a good 80% of the Nonstop Debates and when you do it's usually obvious enough that you're supposed to use it. I like it for adding that little extra layer to the debates. It makes you think and pay attention.

   </b>
   ... But he was acting weird...how?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="94-Hifumi17.png"/>
   : If you're presented with the opportunity to check out the girls locker room, you absolutely take it...! That's a natural reaction for any guy!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="84-Byakuya5.png"/>
   :
   <b>
    The victim was Chihiro
   </b>
   , who was a girl. So of course I would suggest we check the girls locker room first. There was no time for pointless distractions. What's so strange about that?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="95-Hifumi15.png"/>
   : I wish you'd taken me with you...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Hearing Byakuya's comment about Chihiro being a girl, I realized there's a clear contradiction there! I need to make that contradiction clear!
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Narration.png"/>
   : How could Byakuya have known who the victim was before we even discovered her? That's the contradiction! However, our only Truth Bullet is the Monokuma File #2 bullet, which doesn't really help us in this situation. That's why...

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-Narration.png"/>
   : ...we need to borrow Hina's statement. The weak point gets loaded into our Truth Cylinder as a greenish bullet. It will disappear after we fire it or if we change bullets, so when firing them make sure your shot will hit otherwise you'll have to go around the debate again.

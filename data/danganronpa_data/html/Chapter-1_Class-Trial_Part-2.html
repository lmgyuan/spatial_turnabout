   : Because you see, if the room did belong to the killer, then they did something
   <b>
    most bewildering
   </b>
   . And until we unravel that little mystery, you simply can't declare that he's the killer.

   : As things advance further in a class trial, the
   <b>
    Hangman's Gambit
   </b>
   will eventually take place. The point of this is to reveal an
   <b>
    important phrase
   </b>
   related to the incident in question. You'll have to deduce the phrase from the
   <b>
    letters flying around
   </b>
   and the
   <b>
    letters already known
   </b>
   . Complete the phrase by shooting down the flying letters in
   <b>
    the right order
   </b>
   . If you shoot down the wrong letters, you'll
   <b>
    suffer damage to your Influence Gauge
   </b>
   . If the gauge reaches zero, or if you run out of time,
   <b>
    you fail
   </b>
   .
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Narration.png"/>
   : Hangman's Gambit is very simple in this game and can usually be completed in less than 30 seconds. More importantly though, now that the game has mentioned it, I'll briefly explain the Influence Gauge.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Narration.png"/>
   : The Influence Gauge is the Heart meter that keeps showing up during the Nonstop Debates and multiple-choice questions. Shoot the wrong weak point or get an answer wrong and you will lose 1 heart from the meter. You only have 5 hearts for the whole trial, but you can replenish them in 1/2 hearts by answering the multiple choice questions correctly. If you run out of hearts, the trial "reaches a conclusion" in which everyone thinks Makoto did it even if there's no connection for him to the trial. But you can also just hit the Continue prompt and he'll shake it off and you just go back to whatever trial segment you were on. You will be docked a little on the final trial scorecard though.

   <i>
    <b>
     Something that should have been at the scene
    </b>
    but wasn't... That must be the crucial point. If we can just figure out what that something is...
   </i>

   : As the tutorial mentioned, you begin with some letters already known. The goal is to shoot the incoming letters in the order that completes the word.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-144.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-Narration.png"/>
   : For example, the word we're trying to complete is "HAIR" because that's what we know to be missing from the crime scene. Therefore, we must shoot the A first, then the R. Red letters take 1 shot to be captured, orange take 2 and yellow take 3. It's a very easy minigame thanks to how many hint letters the game gives you.

   <br/>

   </b>
   on the floor!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Chihiro5.png"/>

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Makoto30.png"/>
   : Yes. And if I were the culprit, why would I need to get rid of all the hair in my own room?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="32-Makoto29.png"/>
   : It wouldn't be unusual at all to find my hair at the crime scene, if the crime scene is in my room.

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Celeste7.png"/>
   : The reason all the hair was gone...was to remove any trace that

    Sayaka had ever been there
   </b>
   . That makes sense, does it not?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="35-Kyoko2.png"/>
   : No. If that were the case, they would have had to do something about the body itself, not just her hair.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Hifumi18.png"/>
   : Ah-ha-ha! Yes, very true, very true!

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : The killer got rid of it all, of course. To remove any trace that

   <br/>

   : Precisely. It's simply beyond reason to believe that the room's owner and the killer are one and the same.

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Kyoko15.png"/>
   : No. There are other reasons that prove Makoto couldn't have done it.

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Mondo2.png"/>
   : Yeah, then they ran after her, got into the bathroom, and stabbed her.
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-Kyoko13.png"/>
   : So the reason the door didn't open was just because it was stuck. But the killer didn't know that, and assumed it was locked. So they tore apart the doorknob to get in.

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Kyoko15.png"/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : Well, to be more specific... What the killer didn't know was that Makoto and Sayaka had switched rooms. Which is what led to the misunderstanding about the bathroom. If Sayaka had been in her own room, then...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="92-Taka11.png"/>
   : Then there would have been a lock on the door, and they would've had to break through...!

   <br/>
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="94-Kyoko5.png"/>
   : Ultimately, we can't know if it came open by force or simply by accident, but... The killer must have been considerable confused, with no idea how they actually got the door opened.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="2-Byakuya.png"/>
   : Regardless, it was a pointless act. Wasting time trying to break down a door that wasn't locked is...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="31-Makoto30.png"/>
   : ...definitely something I wouldn't do, since I would've known exactly why it wasn't opening. Right?

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="114-Hina2.png"/>
   : Oh yeah! Okay, so, umm... Well, I was just wondering, how'd the culprit get into Makoto's room in the first place?

   <br/>

   : Hmm... Yes, how *did* the killer get inside?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="70-Leon13.png"/>
   : Maybe Sayaka just dropped the key somewhere and the culprit picked it up. That's possible, right?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="116-Taka16.png"/>
   : I don't think so. That seems way too convenient.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="117-229.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="118-Chihiro14.png"/>
   : Then...maybe someone picked the lock?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="104-Taka7.png"/>
   : Negative! If you remember, Monokuma made it quite clear that the locks are all unpickable.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="119-Hifumi17.png"/>
   : Fine, how about this? The killer got in the easy way.

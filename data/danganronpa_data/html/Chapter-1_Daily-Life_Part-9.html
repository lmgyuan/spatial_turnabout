    Her voice sounded like all the air had been squeezed out of her lungs. Just hearing her talk made me tense up.

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Sayaka16.png"/>
   : It was like someone was trying to force the door open. My door was locked, so they couldn't get in, of course. But they started shaking the door harder and harder. I was so scared I couldn't even move.

   : S-So what happened!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Sayaka16.png"/>

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Makoto.png"/>
   : Y-You don't have to worry about that, right? I mean, we can't go outside during nighttime.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Sayaka16.png"/>
   : But that's just a promise we made, right? If someone decided to break that promise...

   : Makoto...please be careful. If someone comes to the door, don't open it no matter what.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Makoto.png"/>
   : I won't. The same goes for you, Sayaka. No matter who it is, don't open your door for anyone.

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-009.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Makoto.png"/>
   : Oh, by the way... Just so you know, my bathroom door tends to get stuck. There's a little trick to opening it... You have to turn the knob, then lift up on the door while you pull it out. Just do that and the door should open no problem.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="28-Sayaka4.png"/>
   : Okay, but the showers don't work during nighttime anyway, right?
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Sayaka6.png"/>
   : But I guess I might use it when I get up in the morning. So thank you.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Makoto.png"/>
   : Okay, well, I'd better get going. See you tomorrow, Sayaka.

   : Hm?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Sayaka6.png"/>
   : When I said I was psychic, it really was a joke. Honestly, I'm just very perceptive.

    Sayaka gave me one last parting smile, and I headed off to "my" room.

    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-016.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I looked around as soon as I got out into the hall. Everyone else's doors were closed. There was no sign of life.

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Makoto.png"/>
   : Good. There's nobody here...
   <br/>

    Making sure nobody was around to spot me, I rushed into Sayaka's room.

    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-017.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    So this is Sayaka's room... It really doesn't look any different from mine.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Makoto.png"/>
   : It smells nice, though...
   <br/>
   <br/>

   : We can examine a few things before we go to bed.

    It's kind of weird to dig through other people's trash, but I couldn't help taking a quick peek...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="37-019.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    That's...! There wasn't any doubt about it--it was the DVD with her name on it that we'd found in the A/V room.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Makoto.png"/>
   : That reminds me... I never did get a chance to find out what was in her video.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    But it's probably best if I wait until she brings it up again.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-020.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    If I remember right, all the girls' private bathrooms have locks on them. I'm a little reluctant to go in...
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="39-021.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    My room came with a toolkit, but Sayaka has a sewing kit. Just like the note said... And next to it is...the map of the body's vital organs.

   <br/>

   : I don't think Sayaka would like me snooping around too much... I should probably go to bed soon.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    As I lowered myself onto Sayaka's bed, a pleasant fragrance enveloped me.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Sayaka's...scent... Maybe it'll bring me some sweet dreams.

    <br/>

   : Imagine you're all in a big spaceship, in the middle of an intergalactic adventure. You've heard of Noah's Ark, right? We're sort of like that. We've set sail and left Earth behind! Here you don't have to worry about crazy neighbors, corrupt cops, drunk drivers, or pyromaniacs! You don't have to worry about the ozone layer, or asthma-inducing air pollution! And of course, you don't have to stress about studying for finals or practicing for the big game! But... But even our divine world of freedom has a few rules. After all, freedom can only exist *because* of rules. If you're really dead set on returning to that tiny piece of dog poop you call Earth...please do your best to follow the rules. I hope I've made myself perfectly clear. So then, let's everyone do our best to follow these new guidelines and live happily ever after together!

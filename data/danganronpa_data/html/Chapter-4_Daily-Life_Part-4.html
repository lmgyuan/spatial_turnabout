   : Here we go...

   <b>
    &gt; "Can you tell us what you found out?"

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-AlterEgo5.png"/>
   : Sure. I analyzed the files and extracted all the useful information I could find. And one particularly important fact I discovered was that a
   <b>
    certain plan
   </b>
   had been put into effect here.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   &gt; "To isolate the students of Hope's Peak Academy and create a communal life for them."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-AlterEgo5.png"/>
   : That was the stated goal of the plan... But it was meant to be more than just a normal school life. The students were intended to live out the rest of their lives here.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Th-That's...!
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="43-208.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Sakura5.png"/>
   : It's...exactly the situation we've found ourselves in.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-AlterEgo5.png"/>
   : It's quite unthinkable, isn't it? And what's more, the one who came up with the plan was non other than the
   <b>
    administrators of Hope's Peak themselves
   </b>
   .
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Hina9.png"/>
   : What!? Wait, hold on! Then the reason we've been imprisoned here... It wasn't the work of some psycho freak or criminal organization or whatever...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="46-Hina10.png"/>
   : It was...the school itself?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="47-211.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Hiro8.png"/>
   : That doesn't make any sense! Why would they do that!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="48-Kyoko.png"/>
   : I don't think Alter Ego is finished. Perhaps we should hear the rest...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-AlterEgo5.png"/>
   : It seems that the reason they devised this plan was because of
   <b>
    what happened
   </b>
   one year ago. This is how they described that event... They said it was the "
   <b>
    biggest, most awful, most tragic event in human history
   </b>
   ."
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Hina9.png"/>
   : What does that mean...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-Hiro8.png"/>
   : Yeah, what kind of name is that for something!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Kyoko7.png"/>
   : ...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="49-214.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="50-AlterEgo4.png"/>
   : Otherwise known as The Tragedy, it was apparently some sort of devastating occurrence. Because of The Tragedy, Hope's Peak Academy was forced to discontinue its role as a school and close down.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="34-Kyoko11.png"/>
   : I see. Things are finally starting to make sense... What this means is, one year ago, this thing--this tragedy--took place. And whatever it was, it forced Hope's Peak to shut down. From there, they decided to use the school as a kind of staging ground...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Kyoko13.png"/>
   : They planned to sequester the students here, where they would live out the rest of their lives.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="52-216.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Hina2.png"/>
   : But...why would the Hope's Peak administrators want to shut everyone in like that?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="44-Sakura5.png"/>
   : And what could this "tragic event" have possibly been?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    In a flash, Kyoko had typed their questions into the computer. And the answer we got was...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="54-AlterEgo6.png"/>
   : Sorry...I don't know. If that information was ever on this computer, it's gone now... I'm totally useless... I'm sorry.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    And that's all he said.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="55-218.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="56-Hiro6.png"/>
   : Then...is this really the end? We get halfway through the answer, and that's it?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="57-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : It would appear so. Disappointing...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-AlterEgo5.png"/>
   : Oh, wait! There's one other thing I forgot to mention. I think it might be important. I believe it has to do with the
   <b>
    mastermind
   </b>
   ...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="42-Makoto2.png"/>
   : The mastermind!?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Kyoko's fingers moved even faster than they had so far...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <b>
    &gt; "Did you figure out the mastermind's identity?"
   </b>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="41-AlterEgo5.png"/>
   : No...that I still don't know. But I *did* find a clue, I think. The one leading the Hope's Peak staff, the one who finalized the plan to isolate you was the
   <b>
    Hope's Peak headmaster
   </b>
   . So that same person may very well be the mastermind who planned all this out. And according to the files, the headmaster is
   <b>
    a man in his late thirties
   </b>
   . It seems possible, even likely, that he's
   <b>
    somewhere in this school
   </b>
   right now.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="58-220.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="59-Kyoko10.png"/>
   : The headmaster...is here in the school!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="60-Hina22.png"/>
   : Then that's gotta be the mastermind! I mean, Monokuma's been calling himself the headmaster, right?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Sakura3.png"/>
   : Which makes the real headmaster that much more suspicious...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="61-Hiro12.png"/>
   : But if we break down the door to his room, we're dead, right? So what are we supposed to do?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="62-224.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Kyoko8.png"/>
   : I'll find a way...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Hiro7.png"/>
   : Huh?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="63-Kyoko8.png"/>
   : No matter what it takes...I will find the headmaster. No matter the cost...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Hina9.png"/>
   : Kyoko? What's going on...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="38-Kyoko7.png"/>
   : ...I can't explain why. I just...know that I have to find him.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    She "has" to? Kyoko...what's going on with you? When she heard about the headmaster, her reaction was almost...violent.
   </i>

   : ...We should see if Alter Ego has any more information.

    That seemed to be an attempt to regain her composure, and she started typing again.

   : We won't have to talk to him all that much anymore.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Hina9.png"/>
   : But...I feel kinda sorry for him.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-Hiro4.png"/>
   : You feel sorry...? But "he's" just a computer program, right?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="45-Hina9.png"/>
   : I know, but still...he did everything he could for us, ya know?
   <br/>
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="76-Hiro2.png"/>
   : I mean, yeah, it did. But that's what a computer program is *designed* to do. You don't tell a computer "good job" every time you shut it down, do you?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="53-Hina2.png"/>
   : Well, no... But when we talked to Alter Ego, I guess I just...didn't see it that way.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto.png"/>
   : I know what you mean. I feel the same way.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-Hiro14.png"/>
   : Hey, come on! It's just a program! You *can* tell the difference between a program and a friend, right?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto.png"/>
   : But you know...what's the difference between us and that program, really?

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Hiro7.png"/>
   : Huh...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto.png"/>
   : I started thinking about how you would differentiate a person and an AI. Alter Ego isn't human, I know that. It's just a program running on a computer. But at the same time, I couldn't help but think of him as our
   <b>
    friend
   </b>
   .

   : Yeah! He's no different from us! He's still our friend!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="74-Hiro4.png"/>
   : I think...maybe I understand where you're coming from...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="79-Hiro3.png"/>
   : Then there's no problem calling him a friend! After all, the more friends the merrier, right!?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-Hiro15.png"/>
   : Check this out! Friendship has no survival value. Instead, it gives value to survival.

   : Don't "so anyway" that! It's a totally smart and cool thing that I quoted from I don't remember where!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-Kyoko2.png"/>
   : Anyway, there's nothing more Alter Ego can do to help us. As such, his role in this is over. Am I wrong about that?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto.png"/>

   : Maybe all the students here were killed or something!
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="88-Hina15.png"/>

   : Maybe. But right now there's only one path open to us... We have to find the headmaster of Hope's Peak Academy. We have to find him, and make him tell us everything.

    The Ultimate Despair... A group of people who caused The Tragedy one year ago... Those same people put together this killing game and began broadcasting it around the world. The most desperately awful group of people ever... *That* is the mastermind's true identity. Our enemy has finally been revealed... But right now...

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Kyoko2.png"/>
   : Right now we have to get out of this horrible place. Figuring out the rest of the story can come after.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Yeah, you're right... Kyoko, do you still have that one thing? Monokuma's "secret tool" that you got from the headmaster's room?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Kyoko2.png"/>
   : Of course I do.
   <br/>
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Kyoko2.png"/>
   : It's an absolutely vital part of ensnaring the mastermind. I would never part with it.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : And it can open any door in the school, right?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Kyoko.png"/>
   : That's right.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Then we should be able to use it on that door, right?
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-008.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-009.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Hey, Kyoko. We can use that key of yours to open this door, right?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Kyoko.png"/>
   : Let's find out.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-010.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Kyoko took out the key with the Monokuma design on it and slid it into the keyhole. And then...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   *Click*
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Yes! It opened!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Kyoko2.png"/>
   : And now we can get out of here. Let's go.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Sounds good.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    We quickly opened the door and made our escape from the garbage pit.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="1-001.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Finally... We were finally free. But there wasn't even time to take a breath of relief. Because the real fight had just begun...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="11-011.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-012.png"/>

    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="13-WelcometoDespair.png"/>
   </a>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    After leaving the garbage pit, we found ourselves in a tunnel extending straight up, like a chimney. There was a metal ladder leading up into the tunnel. We started climbing the ladder, intent on reaching the surface.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-013.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The ladder was impossibly long; I couldn't even see where it ended. We climbed into the darkness... The passage was so dark and cramped, I couldn't even see my own feet beneath me.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : I had no idea we were so far down...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Kyoko.png"/>
   : Don't lose your footing. If you slip, I won't be able to catch you...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Y-Yeah, I'll be careful...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    But now that you said that, I'm getting kind of nervous...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : ...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Maybe talking will help keep my mind off it...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="15-014.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Um, so Kyoko...there's something I wanted to ask you. You said you're the
   <b>
    Ultimate Detective
   </b>
   , right? So how long have you been doing detective work?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Kyoko.png"/>
   : How long...? Ever since I can remember. I come from a long line of detectives. Detective work is in my blood. There was a time when being a detective was considered a sacred duty. My family's always seen it that way.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Then...is your family famous?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Kyoko.png"/>
   : Quite the opposite, actually. Even among actual detectives, many people haven't heard of us.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Huh? But...how come? It's like your family tradition, right? So...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Kyoko.png"/>
   : Because we take pride in it.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Pride...?
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Kyoko.png"/>
   : A detective is neither light nor shadow. We represent neither justice nor evil. That is how we can uncover the absolute truth. We stand neutral in all things. And to do that, we have to stand separate from the rest of society. Which is why we've made a conscious effort to conceal our existence.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Makoto35.png"/>
   : A conscious effort...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Kyoko.png"/>
   : It's kind of old-fashioned, and I can't say it's entirely rational... But it's our family creed, and we do what we must to protect it. Because, like I said, it's our source of pride.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Pride... So that explains...
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-FlashT.png"/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="18-017.png"/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="19-FlashB.png"/>
    <br/>
    Before I came here, when I was looking up info about the school online, I never saw anything about her. Because she hid herself on purpose, to protect the pride of her family...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-018.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : And yet... I...gave up some of that pride.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Makoto35.png"/>
   : Huh...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Kyoko.png"/>
   : In order to enter Hope's Peak, I had to reveal myself to the school. I did it knowing it was something a true Kirigiri detective would never do.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    But the reason you gave up that pride... The reason you would go so far to enter Hope's Peak...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Makoto35.png"/>
   : It was because that's how much you wanted to reconnect with your dad, right? There's no shame in that.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Kyoko.png"/>
   : ...Reconnect...? I had absolutely no desire to reconnect with my father.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Makoto35.png"/>
   : Huh...? B-But...you'd be reuniting after all those years, right? You would've had so much to talk about...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Kyoko.png"/>
   : There's nothing I want to talk to my father about. There is something I want to *say* to him, though.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Makoto35.png"/>
   : What...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Kyoko.png"/>
   : No matter what it takes, I have to find him and tell him, face to face...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Wh-What is it...?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="22-015.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <a href="https://clyp.it/crgry5sz" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="23-DeathWish.png"/>
   </a>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Kyoko.png"/>
   : I want to sever all ties with him.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Sever...?
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : The last time I saw him...I was still very young. So I don't remember myself, but apparently he was extremely intelligent. He was in line to become the next head of the Kirigiri family. He was talented, he had a promising future. But he had no interest in detective work. So he cut himself off from the family. Not long after that, my mother died, and he simply...ran away. He went to my grandfather, and they had a huge argument. And young as I was...he left me behind.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Makoto35.png"/>
   : I-I'm sure there was a reason for that. I'm sure your dad wanted to take you with him.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : If that's true, then I need to thank him. Thank him for leaving me... Because unlike him, I take
   <b>
    pride
   </b>
   in the work I do. I take
   <b>
    pride
   </b>
   in my family name. So every last part of me is happy he didn't take me with him. If I'd gone with him, I never would have had the chance to become a detective.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    I was above Kyoko on the ladder, so I wasn't able to see her expression. So I couldn't tell... I couldn't see how she looked when she said that, what she might have been feeling. All I could tell was that compared to her usual self...she was more talkative. And more emotional.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Kyoko.png"/>
   : I don't blame him, you know. He had his own life to live. That's what anyone in my position might say, right? But it's not true... There's one thing... One thing I can never forgive.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="24-016.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="16-Makoto35.png"/>
   : Really...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Kyoko17.png"/>
   : The way everyone else looked at me. I was never sad about being left behind. Like I said, I think it was a good thing. But when the rest of my family looked at me, they saw something different. They only saw me as
   <b>
    the little girl that was abandoned by her father
   </b>
   . That's how they see me even to this day. His shadow has been following me my entire life. I'm sick of it. I need him out of my life. I need to step out of his shadow. That's why I have to find him, and tell him we're no longer family. In order to settle the past... In order to remove him from my life forever. I have no doubt he forgot about me years ago.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : B-But...you're family. To just cut him out like that...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Kyoko.png"/>
   : Our only connection is through blood, nothing more. Are we connected by heart and soul? No. Is blood really enough to call someone family?
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    Only connected by blood, not by heart or soul... I was so shocked to hear her say something like that, I didn't know how to respond. So instead...I said nothing.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-012.png"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I just kept climbing the ladder in complete silence. And after I don't know how long...we finally reached the top.
   </i>

   : On the other side of this door...Hope's Peak is waiting for us.

   : We're...back.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-Kyoko.png"/>
   : Remember that hatch on the ground near the trash room? I'm fairly certain that's where we'll come out. I unlocked it earlier, so it should open without much trouble.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Well, here goes nothin'...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    I reached my right hand up and pushed against the hatch.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   *Creak*
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    The hatch opened with ease. And so...

   : But I can't believe how long that ladder was. I'm exhausted...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    I can't exactly say we're safe and sound, but...at least we're out of there. Now we're back in Hope's Peak Academy...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Kyoko...thank you. I never would've gotten out of there without you.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="29-022.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Kyoko2.png"/>
   : No thanks necessary. I was just returning the favor.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : So...now what do we do? I'm glad I didn't die, of course, but if the mastermind finds out... And I'm worried about you, too. You helped me, so they might...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Kyoko7.png"/>
   : You're worried?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : Y-Yeah, of course.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-Kyoko2.png"/>
   : Then let's just get a concrete answer.

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="33-Kyoko13.png"/>
   : Because the mastermind is the one that's ensnared.

   <i>
    The mastermind is ensnared...

   <br/>
   <br/>

   : You said something like that before. What does it mean...?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="30-Kyoko7.png"/>
   : The mastermind stood exposed during the investigation into Mukuro's death. There was a moment where the mastermind let their guard down.

   : There was...?

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="36-Kyoko3.png"/>
   : If we can talk to Monokuma, we can confirm it. And it'll be better for us if we go to him directly before he tracks us down. That should help with out negotiations...
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    ...I'm still a little--no, super uneasy about this.
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Makoto2.png"/>
   : But...we don't really have a choice, do we?

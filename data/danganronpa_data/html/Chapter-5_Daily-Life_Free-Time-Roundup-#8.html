Hifumi's FTE Chain is 5 events long. Like Taka's update, this one will probably be a little long due to wanting to put his remaining four events into one update.

   : Naturally! You don't become the
   <b>
    Ultimate Fanfic Creator
   </b>
   without a few legends sprouting up around you! One legend is how, in middle school, I was able to convince the school to create a fanfic club!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Hifumi15.png"/>
   : And from that day, I exposed myself and my fanfic to the world at large! By the way, do you happen to know what all my work is based on?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Makoto.png"/>
   : Sorry, no idea...
   <br/>

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="14-Hifumi17.png"/>
   : Now, you might think that that sounds totally cliche, but you would be WRONG! I didn't simply copy the "pretty girl" Princess Piggles style. I took a total meta sci-fi approach! My perspective was seen as quite odd, of course, but if you really look at what I was doing, my version of Princess Piggles was the total antithesis of the new-wave sci-fi movement. In fact, it was my response to J.G. Ballard's speculative fiction stylings!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Hifumi15.png"/>
   : Buwheh! Ahh, my geekdom is leaking out again. I apologize!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Hifumi3.png"/>
   : Anyway, unlike most fans, I never saw Princess Piggles as your typical moe anime.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Makoto.png"/>
   : Yeah, I definitely got that impression... But I can't believe you were able to single-handedly persuade the school to let you make a club...

   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="17-Hifumi.png"/>
   : It's when a circle gets together to come up with a project or event focused on only one show or series. So a Princess Piggles single-setting event would only allow works involving Princess Piggles, see? On the flipside, if there's no restriction on the number of properties, do you know what that's called?

   ?

   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="20-Hifumi14.png"/>
   : More and more slackers are showing up with no idea what fanfic really means! It's so ANNOYING! So in order to crush these peons with all my might, I'm going to start taking part in more free-for-alls!
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-Makoto.png"/>
   : Crush them...? That doesn't sound very friendly...
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-Hifumi12.png"/>
   : I don't participate in these events to make friends! And I cannot forgive those lazy bastards! And don't tell me to ignore them! If you let some little wimp survive, you'll regret it later! Play any RPG where the villain spares the hero when he's level 1, and what happens? Boom! Dead!

I wanted to experience that sensation again, so I started buying all the Princess Piggles stuff I could.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="51-Hifumi6.png"/>
   : Unfortunately, in the show itself, the princess never falls in love... So as much as I wanted to, I never got to see her face filled with love, the way I did in my dream.

   . It takes 5 SP. It's actually a really helpful skill if you know you're likely to take damage during a trial because it will slowly restore your HP gauge while you're Focusing. It combos well with other Focus Gauge-related skills and is overall a solid choice. The major downside again is that it's locked behind Hifumi's FTEs so you'd need to know of its existence on the first playthrough or get really lucky and choose to do his events before he dies. The other downside is that it uses a lot of SP, meaning you have less opportunity to use other skills. It's one of only three skills to use 5 SP.

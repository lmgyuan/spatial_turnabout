   "On a locked and rusted door
   <br/>
   I dug my nails in and dragged them down
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Warm blood mixed with old rust
   <br/>
   Flowing down my wrist
   <br/>
   Coils like a snake
   <br/>
   Embracing my body
   <br/>
   <br/>
   You watch me
   <br/>
   A smile in your eyes
   <br/>
   You watch
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Time runs away
   <br/>
   And you with it
   <br/>
   You leave me drowning in a red sea."

   : I should probably use the key we found on that locker, right?

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="12-376.png"/>

   <br/>
   <i>
    I took out the woodblock key and inserted it into the locker's metal lock, and...
   </i>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   *Click*
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <i>
    The locker eagerly accepted the key, and it opened.

   : They look like they're made of
   <b>
    titanium
   </b>

   : If it is, that means it must surely be related to the case.
   <br/>
   <br/>

    This duct tape is related to the case somehow...? But...how could it possibly be involved?

    <br/>

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-Byakuya9.png"/>
   : It's very odd, don't you think? The locker was hiding items that were clearly related to the case. But how did the key to the locker wind up in the victim's room...?
   <br/>

   : Huh? What next location?
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="21-Byakuya7.png"/>

   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="10-Makoto2.png"/>

   <br/>
   <b>
    Crystal Prediction:
   </b>
   Decreases an argument to three statements or less. Effective during the Nonstop Debate, and the Bullet Time Battle Final Strike. Costs 5 SP.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   -This skill came from Hiro. By now in the trial we typically have 5 bullets to choose from during any given debate. This skill eliminates false possibilities, leaving only three behind. It's pretty handy on harder difficulties but I don't have much reason to use it here, especially when it needs that much SP to use. I'm not willing to give up anything else for it.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-Narration.png"/>
   : We only got 1 more SP this chapter and unfortunately that isn't enough to give us enough SP to equip anything else. I thought about unequipping something and trading for another, but in the end I decided to stick with what I took to Chapter 4's trial:
   <b>
    Algorithm, Upshift, Cool and Composed, Robot Jock, Melodious Voice and Handiwork
   </b>
   . This puts me at 15/17 SP used up. If I had 2 more SP I would've equipped Breathing Technique to make my Focus Gauge recharge faster as a "just-in-case" measure.

   : Before we begin Free Time, we need to get some things. Remember this machine from a previous update? Well the time has finally come to talk about presents.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Narration.png"/>
   : Presents are used in conjunction with Free Time. Each person has presents that they like, love and hate. There are something around 100 presents that you can give out and a few more that are related to progression through the game's chapters and postgame stuff. There isn't really a good way to figure out what presents someone will or won't like because while you can make some good educated guesses based on each present's description and what you know of everyone's characters, occasionally there will be a few things you think they might love/hate that they actually think the opposite of. If you give a present they love, you only need to give them that one present. If it's just something they find acceptable, you may need to give them a second one.
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Narration.png"/>
   : The presents themselves come from this machine in the school store called the MonoMono Machine. This is also where the Monocoins we've been picking up are used.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="4-002.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Narration.png"/>
   : So here's how the machine works. You put in at least one coin and push X to get a present.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="5-003.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="6-004.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Narration.png"/>
   : It's very simple. However, as you get more presents, the Repeat % number will go up, telling you the chance of getting a repeat present. You can make this number go down by using more coins but I've found it to not usually be worth it to use too many. As long as you have a wide enough variety of presents, you're sure to have something that a person will love. Not only that, but you receive lots of coins at the end of each chapter, meaning that the next time you come here you could have an easy 50+ spins. You can also give someone the same present twice and there's no downside. It's really not hard to have presents the people you want to spend Free Time with will love.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="7-005.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Narration.png"/>
   : Also, you will randomly get a free bonus spin. This spin does take into account the Repeat %.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="8-006.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Narration.png"/>
   : I spent all the coins I had since having a variety of presents in Chapter 1 is difficult due to the low number of coins available at this point in the game. You can see that our presents list is beginning to fill up.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="9-007.png"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <img alt="" border="0" class="img" src="3-Narration.png"/>
   : Now that we have presents, we can begin Free Time in earnest.
   <br/>
   <br/>

   <br/>

Even if I understand where her desperation is coming from, I can't share in it. The pressure she's under is way different from anything a normal high school like me goes through. She didn't just stumble into this school the way I did. So I can't say I feel things the way she does. Compared to her...no, compared to everyone else here...there's no doubt I just don't match up.

Because we only have a few presents, our choice for who to visit with is a little more limited than it will be in future chapters, but I decided to visit with Leon and Byakuya. We have gifts they both love and they also have skills that will help us more than Sayaka's skill will right now. Convenient!

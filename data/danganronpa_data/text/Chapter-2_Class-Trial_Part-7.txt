7-Monokuma2.png
: In case you're wondering, the vote was NOT unanimous. Kiyotaka chose the wrooong answer! You're treading very close to the danger zone, Mr. Ishimaru! You need to be more careful!
9-Taka12.png
: I-I refuse to believe it... There's no way...no way he would kill someone!
10-Mondo17.png
: Sorry...
11-Taka13.png
: Wh-Why are you apologizing!?
9-Taka12.png
: Why!? Why why why why why!? WHYYY!? Wh...why?
13-Taka6.png
: Why did you do it!?
10-Mondo17.png
: ...
14-Monokuma.png
: Well, it looks like Mondo's taken a vow of silence, so allow me to explain on his behalf...
15-Monokuma4.png
: The story of murder this time...is the sad story of two men. Oh, but for anyone who doesn't really wanna hear it you can hit the Circle button to fast-forward the text!
17-DeathWishNoIntro.png
14-Monokuma.png
: Anyway, there was once a young boy... And his name was Chihiro Fujisaki.
14-Monokuma.png
: He had an extreme inferiority complex regarding his own
**
lack of strength
. "You're so weak,
**
even though you're a boy
!" He'd heard things like that as long as he could remember, and he couldn't overcome his weakness. On the contrary, he tried to hide and buried himself
**
further and further
into that weakness to take on the fragile form of a petite young girl. He had chosen that as his
**
way out
.
20-Chihiro13.png
: Now nobody will be able to say anything about "even though you're a boy"...
14-Monokuma.png
: But no matter how tightly he wrapped himself up in that shell, the inferiority complex had already taken root deep inside of him, and was not so easily weeded out. As it turned out, the shell was completely empty. The complex didn't disappear. Instead, it only grew stronger and stronger.
22-Chihiro8.png
: I'm...weak...
23-Chihiro11.png
: Weak, weak, weak, weak, weak, weak, weak, weak...!
24-FlashTLong.png
26-FlashBLong.png
14-Monokuma.png
: Once the
**
killing game
had begun here at the school, he had no choice but to accept this fact. After all, this world is survival of the fittest. If you're not strong, you don't survive.
14-Monokuma.png
: And then the lovely and hateful Monokuma announced the revealing of the
**
embarrassing secrets
. Which, of course, included Chihiro's embarrassing secret, which I was more than willing to divulge...
"
**
Even though he dresses like a girl, Chihiro is actually a boy
."
29-Monokuma8.png
: And that was something Chihiro couldn't let anyone find out, no matter the cost. If that was revealed, it would be the end. The hardened shell would crack, the armor would fall away. Without a doubt, those around him would torture him more than ever before. Everyone figured being thrust into such a dilemma must have sent him spiraling into despair.
14-Monokuma.png
: And yet...!
30-FlashT.png
32-FlashB.png
22-Chihiro8.png
: Um...s-sorry, I don't really want to talk about it right now.
33-Chihiro10.png
: But I also don't want to leave things the way they are. So maybe I can talk about it later... After I try my best...to become strong... Then I can tell everyone.
14-Monokuma.png
: Annoyingly, he used the threat of discovery to motivate himself to become stronger!
35-Chihiro18.png
: Now's my chance... I'm going to get stronger...and accept who I am... Strong enough so that when someone says "even though you're a boy" I'll be okay. I'll get better!
14-Monokuma.png
: With that thought at the front of his mind, he resolved to take immediate action. And so...
30-FlashT.png
32-FlashB.png
14-Monokuma.png
: That day, he made the committment to begin exercising. He was prepared to retrain his mind and body. But sadly... That would be the first and only chance he would get at it!
14-Monokuma.png
: When he'd decided to start exercising, he thought it would be good to ask for someone's help. But he wanted to tell that person his secret first, and then ask them to help him from there. And the person he went to...
10-Mondo17.png
: It was me...!
5-Monokuma5.png
: Yup, it sure was!
15-Monokuma4.png
: The biker gang fella had been painfully clear about how important his
**
manly promises
were. So Chihiro probably figured that even if he confided in Mondo, his honor would make him keep the secret.
6-Mondo15.png
: ...
14-Monokuma.png
: Plus, Mr. Macho Mondo was the very symbol of a
**
strong man
that Chihiro had always aspired to.
35-Chihiro18.png
: Maybe talking to Mondo about it will help give me some courage...
14-Monokuma.png
: So he went and asked Mondo to help him become strong!
29-Monokuma8.png
: That was his aspiration... And he thought that only with Mondo's support would he ever be able to come close to that.
41-Kyoko17.png
: So then, that must be why Mondo
**
did what he did
--to keep the promise he'd made to Chihiro.
42-Makoto2.png
: Huh? Did what he did? You mean...? That's why Mondo carried Chihiro from the boys locker room into the girls locker room?
43-Kyoko.png
: Yes, that's exactly what I mean.
44-Hifumi2.png
: Wasn't that to cover up what he'd done?
45-Kyoko3.png
: That could have been part of it, but I don't think it was the main reason. The real purpose was to keep the
**
promise between men
he'd made to Chihiro.
47-Hina9.png
: But...how does moving the body keep his secret?
48-Kyoko13.png
: Because if everyone knew he'd been killed in the boys locker room then everyone would have been arguing about how "she" got into the *boys* locker room, right? Once that started up, at least a few of us would have immediately begun to suspect his identity. So, he tried to protect Chihiro's secret by putting him in the girls locker room and stealing his handbook. See?
42-Makoto2.png
: Then...Mondo did all that to keep the promise he'd made to Chihiro...who he'd also killed?
10-Mondo17.png
: ...
50-Taka20.png
: Why...would he...do that?
13-Taka6.png
: The more I hear you talk, the more I don't understand! I mean, you guys trusted each other, right!?
51-Taka5.png
: So why? Why did you...?
10-Mondo17.png
: ... Because...no matter what, I didn't want anyone to know...
41-Kyoko17.png
: So that's what triggered it, after all.
30-FlashT.png
32-FlashB.png
41-Kyoko17.png
: The possibility of having your
**
embarrassing memories and secrets
exposed...
9-Taka12.png
: Th-That's impossible! Nothing could have been that bad! Something he didn't want anyone to know, even if it meant killing someone...? It's impossible!
55-Byakuya7.png
: How many times must I repeat myself? To judge others by your own standard is the height of folly. Even if you can't comprehend it, he obviously can. That's all there is to it.
15-Monokuma4.png
: Well, while we're on the subject...why don't I tell you? That embarrassing memory, that secret he didn't want anyone to know... You know what Mondo did?
57-DespairSyndrome2.png
58-Monokuma12.png
: He

killed his own brother

60-Mondo9.png
: Gh--!
14-Monokuma.png
: Mondo, the
**
Ultimate Biker Gang Leader
, makes all the hoodlums and riff-raff across the country tremble... But the only reason he had the chance to join a gang in the first place was because of a
**
certain someone
.
14-Monokuma.png
: Mondo's older brother's name was
**
Daiya Owada
. Mondo had nothing but respect for him. It was because of Daiya that Mondo ever got on a motorcycle.
14-Monokuma.png
: Mondo's older brother was his only family growing up. He was the only one Mondo could trust, or respect. He wanted to measure up to his big brother, so he imitated him in everything he did. Mondo was the epitome of the starry-eyed kid brother.
14-Monokuma.png
: Meanwhile, the charismatic older brother had put together a local motorcycle gang...and before anyone knew it, it had grown into the biggest biker gang in the country. Daiya, the older brother, number one in the gang. And his number two, his younger brother, Mondo. In the beginning, everything was peaches and gravy. But when Mondo started to think about how he would have to take over the gang from his brother someday his brother's greatness, his reputation, began to gnaw on Mondo's very soul!
"The kid's gonna take over for Daiya, huh?"
"Daiya created this gang with his bare hands! Mondo's just along for the ride!"
"Can someone like that really be our leader?"
"All that'll do is make the gang look bad."
14-Monokuma.png
: Almost every day, Mondo heard the gossip and whispers of the other members of the gang. Which is why...
65-Mondo16.png
: I gotta get stronger...stronger than Daiya. Once...just one time... No matter what, I gotta win...
67-ToSurvive.png
65-Mondo16.png
: I don't care what it takes, I gotta come out on top!
14-Monokuma.png
: And on the night of his amazing brother's retirement ceremony, Mondo challenged him to a street race!
14-Monokuma.png
: But during the race, tragedy struck...
14-Monokuma.png
: The kid brother pushed ahead with reckless abandon, eager for victory, and dashed into oncoming traffic. But suddenly...!

: M-My bad, kid... I fucked up. Sorry.
14-Monokuma.png
: Of course he knew it was his brother's fault, but Daiya never blamed him for what happened.

: Hey, kid... The rest is up to you. No matter what, you gotta keep the gang together. Cuz it's the team...
**
you and me
put together. It's...a pr... a
**
promise...between men
...
14-Monokuma.png
: He decided to hide the truth of what happened from everyone else in the gang. In order to keep the gang together, and keep the promise to his brother, he could never admit to anyone that it was his own
**
weakness
that had caused the accident! And as a result...
14-Monokuma.png
: ...the team was made even stronger, under the banner of the
**
kid who'd bested his big brother
. "Daiya was gonna lose to his kid brother, so he got stupid and got himself killed." That became the explanation for what happened. Mondo's lie became the truth. He wanted to lead the team so bad, he was willing to tell all kinds of lies about his brother!

10-Mondo17.png

Everything me and my brother had worked to create...woulda been destroyed... His death...all the guilt I'd been carrying around...it all woulda been for nothing. So that's why...
82-Mondo18.png
: That's why I...I...!
42-Makoto2.png

6-Mondo15.png
: After I saw what Monokuma had on me my head filled up with a kind of fuzzy uneasiness, and just started swirlin' around. I'd never felt anything like it before.

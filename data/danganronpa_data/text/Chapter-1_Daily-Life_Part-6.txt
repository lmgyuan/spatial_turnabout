: Before we begin Free Time, we need to get some things. Remember this machine from a previous update? Well the time has finally come to talk about presents.
3-Narration.png
: Presents are used in conjunction with Free Time. Each person has presents that they like, love and hate. There are something around 100 presents that you can give out and a few more that are related to progression through the game's chapters and postgame stuff. There isn't really a good way to figure out what presents someone will or won't like because while you can make some good educated guesses based on each present's description and what you know of everyone's characters, occasionally there will be a few things you think they might love/hate that they actually think the opposite of. If you give a present they love, you only need to give them that one present. If it's just something they find acceptable, you may need to give them a second one.
3-Narration.png
: The presents themselves come from this machine in the school store called the MonoMono Machine. This is also where the Monocoins we've been picking up are used.
3-Narration.png
: So here's how the machine works. You put in at least one coin and push X to get a present.
3-Narration.png
: It's very simple. However, as you get more presents, the Repeat % number will go up, telling you the chance of getting a repeat present. You can make this number go down by using more coins but I've found it to not usually be worth it to use too many. As long as you have a wide enough variety of presents, you're sure to have something that a person will love. Not only that, but you receive lots of coins at the end of each chapter, meaning that the next time you come here you could have an easy 50+ spins. You can also give someone the same present twice and there's no downside. It's really not hard to have presents the people you want to spend Free Time with will love.
3-Narration.png
: Also, you will randomly get a free bonus spin. This spin does take into account the Repeat %.
3-Narration.png
: I spent all the coins I had since having a variety of presents in Chapter 1 is difficult due to the low number of coins available at this point in the game. You can see that our presents list is beginning to fill up.
3-Narration.png
: Now that we have presents, we can begin Free Time in earnest.
3-Narration.png
: As mentioned, the game requires you to visit with Sayaka for the first Free Time, so let's see how she's doing.
I guess I should press the doorbell...
*Ding dong*
12-Sayaka2.png
: You know, Makoto... I'm so anxious. I really am afraid...
> Spend some time with Sayaka
15-Sayaka10.png
: Are you going to...try and cheer me up?
12-Sayaka2.png
: Sorry for making you take time out of your day like this...
I did my best to comfort Sayaka. Sayaka and I grew a little closer today.
> Yes, definitely

20-Sayaka7.png
: To receive something so wonderful makes me happy, but...
22-Sayaka14.png
: ...to get it from you, Makoto... I can't begin to describe the feeling...!
Seeing Sayaka so pleased with something I gave her makes me happy!
23-DeathWishNoIntro.png
12-Sayaka2.png
: Umm, Makoto? Do you think you could make time for the two of us to talk?
24-Makoto.png
: Wh-What's wrong? Why are you being so formal?
26-Sayaka4.png
: W-Well, it's just... I guess that was kind of formal, but... it's just because I know I can count on you.
24-Makoto.png
: ...Huh?
28-Sayaka6.png
: Having you by my side really makes me feel a lot better.
29-Sayaka5.png
: If you weren't here with me, I just don't know what I'd do. I'd be lost...
28-Sayaka6.png
: I hate that we had to meet again under such awful conditions, but...I'm relieved you're with me.
24-Makoto.png
: Sayaka...
Standing here face to face and hearing her say that... It's nice, but...kind of embarrassing at the same time.
24-Makoto.png
: I...know how you feel. You being here is what saved me...
20-Sayaka7.png
: R-Really? Ehehe. Thank you for the flattery.
That smile... That mysterious smile that softens my heart... I really wasn't flattering her. That smile saved me.
31-Sayaka17.png
: But it's kind of strange, you know? I never thought I'd get a chance to really talk to you like this. All through middle school, you never talked to me. In fact, you never even looked at me.
24-Makoto.png
: It's because you were like a celebrity. I couldn't just go around staring at you... Wait, how do you know I never looked at you?
33-Sayaka.png
: Because I looked at you all the time...
24-Makoto.png
: ...Huh?
26-Sayaka4.png
: I was always looking for
an opportunity to talk to you
.
24-Makoto.png
: You...wanted to talk to me?
35-Sayaka3.png
: But since I always had so many people around me, we ended up graduating without saying a word. That was one of my biggest regrets.
24-Makoto.png
: But why me?
15-Sayaka10.png
: Do you remember during our first year of junior high, that huge bird wandered into the school pond?
Actually, now that I think about it...I do sorta remember something like that...
31-Sayaka17.png
: It was like something out of a fairy tale. The turtle one every million years, that bird once every thousand...
A huge bird wandered into the school pond during our first year of junior high... I think it might have been...
> Crane
24-Makoto.png
: It was a crane! It just walked right into the pond.
38-Sayaka9.png
: That's right! That's what it was. It was so big, the teacher had no idea what to do.
22-Sayaka14.png
: But you led it into the forest behind the school. You helped it find its way out.
Well, only cuz I was already in charge of taking care of the animals at school. They made me do it...
29-Sayaka5.png
: I should have said thank you then, but...is it okay if I do it now?
24-Makoto.png
: Thank me...?
26-Sayaka4.png
: I'm that crane, you see. I've come to return the favor. Here, let me make you a cloak...
3-Narration.png
: The closest reference I could find to cranes and cloaks were legends of
Swan Maidens
that come from various cultures, including Japan. They typically have to do with a man stealing a cloak of feathers from a swan maiden so she cannot fly away, then marries her. She bears his children, then at some point gets her cloak back and flies away.
28-Sayaka6.png
: Ehehe. Just kidding!
24-Makoto.png
: Y-Yeah, I kinda figured...
26-Sayaka4.png
: Honestly though, I was so impressed... That's why I always wanted to talk to you, even just once.
12-Sayaka2.png
: I never imagined this would be how I got my chance...
Yeah. If we'd met again at a train station somewhere downtown, that'd make for a nice dramatic reunion. But instead it's this weird school.
41-Sayaka8.png
: Maybe, but still... I'm sure you'll help me find my way out, just like that crane. You'll save me.
33-Sayaka.png
: It's just intuition, I know, but I still believe it.
I'm going to save her...?
24-Makoto.png
: I'll do my best, I promise that. I'll make sure it's more than intuition. If there's anything I can do, I'm going to do it...!
28-Sayaka6.png
: I believe in you. Besides, my intuition always turns out to be right.
26-Sayaka4.png
: Cuz I'm psychic.
20-Sayaka7.png
: Ehehe. Kidding, kidding!
She laughed out loud as she said it. The closer we get, the stronger that smile of hers makes me. ...I was glad to feel that way.

: Mm, ahem, this is a school announcement. It is now 10 p.m. As such, it is officially
nighttime
. Soon the doors to the dining hall will be locked, and entry at that point is strictly prohibited. Okay then...sweet dreams, everyone! Good night, sleep tight, don't let the bed bugs bite...
Today's already come to an end. But I swear...tomorrow I'm going to find some kind of clue! I swear!
As my eyelids began to slide closed...the conversation I'd had with Sayaka that morning began to replay. In a way, it's almost frustrating... Even if I understand where her desperation is coming from, I can't share in it. The pressure she's under is way different from anything a normal high school like me goes through. She didn't just stumble into this school the way I did. So I can't say I feel things the way she does. Compared to her...no, compared to everyone else here...there's no doubt I just don't match up. I guess that might explain my own frustration...

51-MonokumaTheater.png
: Ahem, so...I'm sure that you've noticed the killing game has begun, but... there's still room for a little laughter. It seems our newest students, already so filled with despair, still have some hope of escape! Puhuhu... So when will it begin? When will their
hope
begin to die? Is it time yet? Is it time!? Heartpounding excitement!

Morning has come. What should I do today?

3-Narration.png
: We have another 2 Free Times today.  Because we only have a few presents, our choice for who to visit with is a little more limited than it will be in future chapters, but I decided to visit with Leon and Byakuya. We have gifts they both love and they also have skills that will help us more than Sayaka's skill will right now. Convenient!
3-Narration.png
: We can find Leon in the halls of the Dormitory.
57-Leon2.png
: What're you doing, Makoto!? We gotta hurry up and find a way outta here!
> Spend some time with Leon
59-Leon7.png
: Y-You're not trying to get me alone so you can kill me, are you...?
60-Leon6.png
: My fans will all go psycho on you if you do! I'm as popular as any international superstar!
62-Leon4.png
: But if you're NOT gonna murder me, then let's hang out. I don't really wanna be alone, anyway...
I spent some time with Leon... Leon and I grew a little closer today.

66-Leon3.png
: This is cool. Super cool! I feel like maybe I do't even hafta get outta here anymore!
60-Leon6.png
: Hah! Yeah, right! I still totally hafta get outta here.
Seeing Leon so pleased with something I gave him makes me happy!
68-Leon13.png
: I'm not even afraid anymore. Now I'm just pissed off...
60-Leon6.png
: Why!? Why is this happening to me!? This isn't fair, man! I mean, am I wrong?
24-Makoto.png
: Oh, um... Yeah, it really isn't.
70-Leon12.png
: Right!? Totally unfair. Ultra unfair! Just like having to shave my head right before every baseball game!
24-Makoto.png
: Well, I mean...you chose to do that, right?
60-Leon6.png
: C'mon, man! Are *you* against me now, too!? I didn't even wanna play! But the coach and all the teachers begged me, so I did it! And then they made me shave my head, just cuz it's "tradition." How's that fair!?
24-Makoto.png
: You really hate baseball that much, huh...?
57-Leon2.png
: Damn straight I do! Who has fun running around on a dusty field for three hours!?
But...for baseball players, the field is like sacred ground, isn't it?
68-Leon13.png
: But it's so not cool! Spending all that time at practice, getting covered in sweat and dirt...
73-Leon.png
: It's just baseball, right? It's easy! Who needs practice!?
I think the gods picked the wrong person to bless with that much talent...
75-Leon11.png
: Still...I gotta admit, baseball wasn't
all bad
. It did have a few things going for it...
24-Makoto.png
: Yeah, right? Like the
feeling of camaraderie between you and your teammates
!
73-Leon.png
: Nah, nothin' like that! I can't stand being around a bunch of sweaty guys. So totally uncool!
24-Makoto.png
: Then...what did you like about it?
62-Leon4.png
: Well, I hate studying, right? But I still got into this super fancy school on a sports scholarship. As long as I kept playing, I never had to study! And besides that...
66-Leon3.png
: It made me super popular with the ladies! Booya! Ya jealous? I got to third base in more ways than one, if ya know what I'm sayin'! ...Just kidding!
24-Makoto.png
: ...
62-Leon4.png
: Heh-heh. I got plenty more where that came from! I'll tell ya more about it next time. Anyway, let's hang out again sometime! Talking to you helps me keep my mind off this place... *leaves*
With a smile on his face and a spring in his step, Leon strolled away. I'm not really sure why, but I guess Leon likes hanging out with me...

There's still lots of time left in the day. I really don't feel like just sitting here. Maybe I'll take a look around...

79-Byakuya3.png

88-Byakuya2.png
: Something's been bothering me for a while now, and I can't take it anymore. So to answer my question...
85-Byakuya9.png
: I need you to explain to me what exactly your "Ultimate Lucky Student" title means.
24-Makoto.png
: Oh, well... I don't totally get it myself, but...what I do know is that I was picked at random from a pool of normal students.
85-Byakuya9.png
: So you just got into Hope's Peak by blind luck.
79-Byakuya3.png
: I see. Well that answers my question.
24-Makoto.png
: What was the question...?
79-Byakuya3.png
: How a commoner like you, with absolutely no unique talents or abilities, could get into this school.
90-Byakuya7.png
: Oh, I forgot to mention boring. How a boring, untalented, utterly generic commoner got in...
Boring? Generic?
24-Makoto.png
: D-Did you really have to list all that off?
90-Byakuya7.png
: But it's the truth.
24-Makoto.png
: Maybe compared to you, the Ultimate Affluent Progeny and all... But even I--!
92-Byakuya4.png
: You seem to think it's merely an issue of title. But make no mistake... My lineage, intelligence, figure, athletic ability--they are all ultimate.
94-Byakuya8.png
: Which is to say, I am the
Ultimate Perfection
. Feel free to begin calling me that, in fact.
He's really taking this to the extreme...
79-Byakuya3.png
: You, who have nothing. I, who have everything. We are living proof that all men are *not* created equal. You have my pity, Makoto. Life can be very cruel indeed.
24-Makoto.png

90-Byakuya7.png
: And because I pity you so much, perhaps someday I'll allow you to hear my tale of glory. Consider it a blessing, a gift from me to you, to allow you to bask in my glory. *leaves*
Having finished his mean-spirited lecture, Byakuya left me standing there in silence.

Even a human piece of excrement could create a masterpiece if they spent their entire life on it! Someone who does things in a timely fashion is both wise and admirable. Straight is better than a curve or an angle. Freestyle is better than the backstroke or breaststroke! Drive-thru is better than sit-down! A Sunday comic artist is smarter than a graphic novelist!

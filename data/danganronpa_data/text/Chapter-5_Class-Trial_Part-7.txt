: No! This isn't right!
7-ClassTrialChaos.png
...Huh?
9-Byakuya10.png
: Makoto, why are you staring off into space? Don't you have a rebuttal for Kyoko's claim?
Her claim...? Oh, that's right. I have to... Do I expose Kyoko's lie or not...?
10-Flashback.png
12-Kyoko13.png
: If you spend all your time trying to avoid danger, you'll never move forward. We know the danger. But if that risk means solving the mystery, we have no choice.
14-Kyoko15.png
: Am I wrong?
10-Flashback.png
She's not wrong. I have to think about this very carefully. What do I do...?
I have to decide right here and now whether or not to expose Kyoko's lie...!
> Let it go
...I've made my decision. I have to believe in Kyoko. There's no way she would kill someone! There has to be some secret here, something that has to do with the
**
mastermind's trap
that Kyoko mentioned.
19-Byakuya6.png
: Well? Does no one have a rebuttal? Have you decided to accept her asertion as fact?
20-Makoto26.png
: ...
9-Byakuya10.png
: I see. So you still refuse to accept it. I suppose we have to admit that Kyoko didn't put the locker key in her room, that it was someone else.
22-Hina9.png
: But...who else could it have been?
23-Hiro5.png
: I mean, Byakuya had her room key, right?
24-Toko12.png
: Y-You! What are you t-trying to imply!?
9-Byakuya10.png
: But of course I have an
**
alibi
. From nighttime on, I was with you guys the entire time... I couldn't possibly have killed anyone, or put the key in Kyoko's room.
23-Hiro5.png
: Well *someone* had to put the key in there...
26-Byakuya.png
: There's only one other possibility I can think of... Someone could have had the key on them, then once they arrived at the scene, pretended to "find" it there.
27-Makoto33.png
: What...?
28-Hina10.png
: I-It had to be Makoto...right?
9-Byakuya10.png
: ...I don't see any other option.
30-Makoto21.png
: W-Wait a second! You've got it all wrong! Let's think about it one more time! There's got to be a hidden side to this case!
23-Hiro5.png
: Huh? A hidden side...?
31-Makoto31.png
: First of all, there's something off about this entire trial! You all see it, don't you?
32-Monokuma.png
: ...
33-Makoto30.png
: Mukuro, who we didn't even know existed, suddenly shows up dead, and then we're thrown into a trial...! And Kyoko even said, it's a trap the mastermind set for us! So that's why...this has to be--!

: Okaaay!

Time's up
!
27-Makoto33.png
: ...Huh?
32-Monokuma.png
: Time's up! Class trial's all over! Everyone can stop talking now!
38-Makoto34.png
: What? Time's up?
39-Kyoko7.png
: What do you mean time's up? There's no "time's up." Since when have we--?
36-Monokuma22.png
: It's because you were late! So we had to push back the start time!
32-Monokuma.png
: So then, it's time for voting time, okay? Everyone, please vote using the lever in front of you!
27-Makoto33.png
: Voting time...?
42-ToSurvive.png
43-Monokuma11.png
: Now, who will be chosen as the blackened? Will you make the right choice, or the dreadfully wrong one?
38-Makoto34.png
: Hey, hold on!
36-Monokuma22.png
: What's it gonna be? What's it gonna beeee!?
50-MrMonokumaAfterClass.png
51-Makoto2.png
: What...? You think *I'm* the killer...?
53-Hiro13.png
: Sorry, man...
22-Hina9.png
: Yeah, s-sorry...
54-Toko5.png
: It's all your f-fault...!
19-Byakuya6.png
: ...
51-Makoto2.png
: Everyone...you're wrong...! You've got it all wrong! I didn't do it!
56-Monokuma5.png
: Good job, everyone!
51-Makoto2.png
: G-Good job...?
32-Monokuma.png
: Yeah. They got it right!
51-Makoto2.png
: N-No, I know that's not true... None of this makes any sense... This whole trial doesn't make any sense!
58-Monokuma6.png
: It makes perfect seeeeEEEENNNSSSSSEEE!!!
59-Monokuma12.png
: It's the same as always! It's just like all the other class trials! And I'm gonna end it the same way!
56-Monokuma5.png
: It's time for your heartpounding, positively thrilling punishment!
51-Makoto2.png
: W-Wait! Why do I--!?
61-Kyoko8.png
: ...
51-Makoto2.png
: Kyoko--!
39-Kyoko7.png
: I don't expect you to forgive me. I know this is all my fault...
51-Makoto2.png
: Kyoko...?
56-Monokuma5.png
: Let's give it everything we've got! It's...PUNISHMENT TIIIME!

Alter Ego
...!
65-Monokuma2.png
: ...Alter Ego!? is this some stupid virus from that stupid guy!?
70-Monokuma3.png
: He must have planted it when he invaded my network...! Damn it all to hell! I don't believe this!
12-Kyoko13.png
: It seems you finally made a miscalculation.
14-Kyoko15.png
: No...you miscalculated from the very beginning.
70-Monokuma3.png
: ...What was that?
72-Kyoko16.png
: What I'm saying is, you shouldn't have underestimated us.
65-Monokuma2.png
: Hmph! Why are you talking like you've already won!? I barely felt a thing! It was a pinch, an itch! The stupid virus is gone now, got it!? And so is Makoto... Maybe I didn't get to smash him flat, but you're never gonna see him again!
56-Monokuma5.png
: To waste away in a garbage-strewn pit... In a way, that's an even BETTER special punishment!
39-Kyoko7.png
: ...
74-Monokuma4.png
: Puhu... Puhuhu...!
32-Monokuma.png
: But it's still not enough... I'm still not satisfied! I'm still gonna bring despair to the rest of you--bring despair to the entire world...!

19-Byakuya6.png
: Hey, Kyoko. What's the meaning of all this? Just what the hell is going on?
39-Kyoko7.png
: It's okay. We're not the ones being trapped this time.
22-Hina9.png
: Huh...?
39-Kyoko7.png
: Now it's the mastermind that's ensnared...
68-Byakuya12.png
: What are you talking about...?
39-Kyoko7.png
: You'll understand soon enough. Very soon indeed...

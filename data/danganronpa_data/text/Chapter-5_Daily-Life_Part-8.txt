: The others are out in the hall as you approach the headmaster's office.
5-Toko11.png
: Naturally Master's the o-one to show such bravery...
6-Toko.png
: Just make sure you don't get in his way.
8-Hina22.png
: Sakura's gonna be watching over us... So we're definitely gonna find something to help us bring this to an end!
10-Hiro2.png
: We've finally reached the climax!
11-Hiro13.png
: So let's hurry up and finish it, before the mastermind catches us all!
13-Byakuya5.png
: This is where we expose every last detail of the mastermind. Is everyone ready?
*Rattle rattle*
17-DespairSyndrome2.png
18-Byakuya3.png
: It's locked. As expected.
19-Makoto2.png
: So...what are you gonna do?
20-Byakuya2.png
: Isn't it obvious? We're going to tear this door off its hinges.
21-Hina9.png
: Wait, but...the rules say--
22-Byakuya.png
: We've seen that the mastermind isn't watching us. Those don't matter anymore.
23-Hiro4.png
: But like Makoto said... If the mastermind did show up while we were in there...
20-Byakuya2.png
: Then we'll just have to finish our business before that can happen.
23-Hiro4.png
: Okay, sure...but...
20-Byakuya2.png
: We've come this far, we can't back down now. We agreed this is what we have to do. So we have to do it.
5-Toko11.png
: S-So beautiful...!
23-Hiro4.png
: For serious...?
26-Hina16.png
: We don't have any choice... We're desperate!
27-Hina15.png
: Let's do it! Let's rip this door down!
28-Hiro12.png
: Okay, but...how are we gonna do that? This thing looks pretty sturdy...
29-Byakuya9.png
: Then we'll need something sturdy of our own.
19-Makoto2.png
: Oh...what about that one thing?
30-FlashT.png
32-FlashB.png
19-Makoto2.png
: The thing in the toolshed...
10-Hiro2.png
: Oh yeah! The
pickaxe
!
29-Byakuya9.png
: Interesting. That could very well be exactly what we need.
22-Byakuya.png
: Now then... Toko, what time is it?
34-Toko2.png
: W-Well, when we left the gym, it was j-just before 9 o'clock. So it's probably 9 on the d-dot now...
20-Byakuya2.png
: Okay. Go get the pickaxe and be back here by 9:01.
35-Hiro8.png
: That's straight-up unreasonable!
37-Toko7.png
: I-I-I...! By m-myself...?
22-Byakuya.png
: Surely you like to have your me-time once in a while, right?
38-Toko10.png
: W-Well...if it's me-and-you-time, Master, then y-yeah...
39-Byakuya7.png
: You know how much time it took you to say that? Then seconds. Take too long, and I'll erase your existence from my consciousness.
40-Toko8.png
: UnacceptabbbbbbllllLLLLLLEEEEEEE!!! *runs off*
With that, Toko ran off, loud as a herd of rabid elephants.
42-Hiro5.png
: For serious, though...are we just gonna knock this door down?
22-Byakuya.png
: No problem is solved by running away. Find your stones and be a man.
He's right... You can't move forward by always avoiding danger...
30-FlashT.png
32-FlashB.png
44-Kyoko13.png
: If you spend all your time trying to avoid danger, you'll never move forward. We know the danger. But if that risk means solving the mystery, we have no choice.
45-Kyoko15.png
: Am I wrong?
Even if it's dangerous, we have to overcome the challenges in front of us...!
42-Hiro5.png
: Maybe, b-but I'm still super stressed... I'm so tense, I can hardly talk... I'm all flubbust--no... I'm totally flabbag--flapstaf--

: Fapsauce!?
35-Hiro8.png
: Gross! Where'd that come from! Wait, Genocide Jill? Where'd YOU come from!?
50-Jill12.png
: Hello hello! It's the wondiferous, murdiferous fiend, here to greet you with a razor-sharp smile!
51-Jill3.png
: Kyeeehahahaha!
53-Byakuya6.png
: What about the pickaxe? Where is it?
54-Jill10.png
: I was supposed to pick an axe...?
53-Byakuya6.png
: No, you seeping imbecile. The *pickaxe*...
55-Jill6.png
: S-Seeping imbecile!? Oh, Master! You wound me with your executive-level barbs!
51-Jill3.png
: Bushwah! Here comes the bloody nose!
57-Hina2.png
: Seriously, though...did you really forget the pickaxe?
58-Hiro15.png
: Omega-3 fatty acids, that's what you need! Great for the ol' memory factory!
19-Makoto2.png
: But I think we already established that their memory doesn't carry over when they switch...
59-Byakuya15.png
: This is a level of uselessness I find difficult to tolerate...
61-Jill.png
: Ah! The light bulb just went on!
62-Jill9.png
: That's why I went to the garden, right!? I was supposed to get the pickaxe!
63-Jill2.png
: Alright, we've solved one mystery! That means there's just
one more mystery left
!
19-Makoto2.png
: One more mystery...?
65-Jill7.png
: Yup! Now we just need to figure out the identity of
Object X
!
21-Hina9.png
: Now what are you talking about...?
66-Hiro14.png
: Did you already forget what we were talking about? You're like, missing out on life...
67-Jill8.png
: I'm not missing out on life! In fact, I found one in the garden!
19-Makoto2.png
: What...? What did you find?

: Didja hear me!? I said corpse!
19-Makoto2.png
: A corpse...!?
61-Jill.png
: That's right! I found a corpse in the garden!
You found a corpse...in the garden...?
71-Byakuya12.png
: Well then. Before we enter the headmaster's room, it appears we have something else to look into.
53-Byakuya6.png
: We're going to the garden.
19-Makoto2.png
: O-Okay...!
As soon as we entered the garden...I saw it. I didn't want to, but...

...I saw someone laying on the ground, with
a mask covering their face
... And there was a knife...buried in their stomach, up to the hilt.
19-Makoto2.png
: Wh-What the...!?
75-Hina13.png
: A-Are they really dead!?
76-Hiro6.png
: For sure. But...

: Who...is it?

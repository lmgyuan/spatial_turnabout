A voice... I could hear a voice...
???: ...wa...
???: ...ke...up...
???: ...
???: ...wake up...
3-Makoto2.png
: ...Huh?
The voice dragged me from deep slumber into hazy half-consciousness. My eyelids were like lead.
6-Makoto7.png
: Kyoko...?
7-Kyoko21.png
: Yes, it's me.
6-Makoto7.png
: Huh...? Kyoko?
7-Kyoko21.png
: I said yes...
6-Makoto7.png
: So Kyoko's here... Wait, what!?
In a flash I was wide awake.
3-Makoto2.png
: Wh-What are you doing here!?
10-Kyoko17.png
: I'm here to wake you up.
3-Makoto2.png
: Oh, I see... Wait, but my door--!
10-Kyoko17.png
: It was unlocked. You're unbelievably careless.
3-Makoto2.png
: It was unlocked!? Are you serious!?
12-Kyoko3.png
: Always. And you don't have to overreact like that every time you're surprised.
3-Makoto2.png
: Wh-What time is it...?
13-Kyoko2.png
: 3 o'clock. In the morning, of course.
It's 3 a.m.!? Why was Kyoko waking me up at this hour...?
3-Makoto2.png
: I-It's so late... What happened...?
16-Kyoko7.png
: I have a

I need to ask...
> favor
3-Makoto2.png
: What's your favor...?
17-Kyoko.png
: Remember what Sakura said at the end of her note? I'm not going to just lay down and die. I *will*

fight you
... I want to find out what she meant by that.
3-Makoto2.png
: Okay, but...how do you plan to do that?
THen Kyoko put her lips next to my ear and whispered...
19-DespairSyndrome2.png
20-Kyoko22.png
: The data center on the 4th floor.
21-Makoto3.png
: ...What?
20-Kyoko22.png
: I'll meet you there. *leaves*
Without another word, she was gone...
3-Makoto2.png
: What the...?
Her words reverberated through my half-dazed head. The
**
data center
...? But I thought it was locked...
I made my way into the after-hours school, and headed for the data center on the 4th floor.
Eventually, I wound up at the data center. But when I arrived...
3-Makoto2.png
: Kyoko's...not here. That's weird. She said she'd meet me. Is she maybe inside already...?
I put my hand to the door, and with a certain amount of force...
*Rattle rattle*
...It didn't open. I tried again, but...
*Rattle rattle*
3-Makoto2.png
: It must be locked.
What was it Kyoko said...? The data center on the 4th floor...

28-Monokuma.png
: Oh-ho! What are you doing up, mister!?
3-Makoto2.png
: Gah!
29-Monokuma3.png
: Breaking into a locked room is incredibly prohibited, don'tcha know?
3-Makoto2.png
: Oh, well, I just...
30-Monokuma2.png
: You're trying to tell me you didn't actually bust in yet, right? But...
32-Monokuma6.png
: ...I can see that, ya dolt! Don't waste my time telling me crap I can see for myself!
30-Monokuma2.png
: It looked like you might break in any second, so I just thought I'd give you a friendly reminder. Or...are you gonna try and tell me you were sleepwalking or something...?
3-Makoto2.png
: N-No, nothing like that...
29-Monokuma3.png
: It's 3 o'clock in the morning, for cryin' out loud! Even *I* get tired, ya know!? Stop being weird and go back to bed!

13-Kyoko2.png
: Why are you out here making a racket?
3-Makoto2.png
: K-Kyoko!?
30-Monokuma2.png
: Ngggrrrhhh! Now you, too!?
32-Monokuma6.png
: Whatever! The two of you, just get back to bed! I'm positively exhausted from the class trial!
10-Kyoko17.png
: ...Sure, you got it. Come on, Makoto. Let's head back.
3-Makoto2.png
: What...?
16-Kyoko7.png
: Didn't you hear me? We're leaving.
3-Makoto2.png
: I have no idea what's going on anymore...
36-Kyoko19.png
: Don't worry about it. Let's just go.
3-Makoto2.png
: O-Okay...
32-Monokuma6.png
: Yeah! YEAH! Go on, get outta here! Shoo! Shoo!
So we left and went back to our rooms...
19-DespairSyndrome2.png
And then...
36-Kyoko19.png
: So. Goodbye.
3-Makoto2.png
: H-Hold on!
13-Kyoko2.png
: ...
3-Makoto2.png
: Listen, what was all that about just now?
She woke me up, made me go to the data center--which just so happened to be locked...! And then she shows up late, and we leave without checking a single thing! What was the point of all that?
10-Kyoko17.png
: ...Don't worry about it.
I figured that would be the end of our conversation, just like always, but...
36-Kyoko19.png
: Well then...goodnight.
3-Makoto2.png
: S-Sure...
And then *that* was over.
But as I turned to leave...

21-Makoto3.png
: What...?
Kyoko was right next to me once again, whispering into my ear...

: Let's begin with a basic explanation of the class trial! So, your votes will determine the results. If you can figure out "whodunnit" then only they will receive punishment. But if you pick the wrong one... Then I'll punish everyone *besides* the blackened, and the one that deceived everyone else will graduate!

14-Hiro5.png

7-Hina16.png

Hina seems really sure that one of those three is the killer... But she must have some reason for believing that...

7-Hina16.png
: It was one of you...
11-Hina15.png
: One of you killed Sakura!
19-Byakuya7.png

the only reason you have
for accusing us?
20-Toko13.png
: That's l-low... That's about as low a-as you can g-get!
There's got to be some reason why Hina feels so strongly...
21-Narration.png
: If you remember, Hina told us in her account that Sakura left notes for all three of them.
> Shoot "the only reason you have" with "Aoi's Account"
26-Makoto25.png
: Another reason you suspect them is because
**
Sakura wanted to meet with them
, right?
7-Hina16.png
: Yeah! And that was
**
right before she died
!
11-Hina15.png
: So there's no doubt about it! One of those three killed her!
I can't disagree with Hina. There's good reason to suspect all three of them... Then does that mean...one of them did it?
17-ArgumentBreak.png
7-Hina16.png
: The fact that Sakura wanted to meet with all three of them... There's no way that's not suspicious!
11-Hina15.png

30-Byakuya.png

never went

I never saw her

7-Hina16.png
: Come on! There's no way *none* of you went!
11-Hina15.png

Those three were definitely contacted, but they claim they never went to see Sakura... But I don't think that's true. One of them is definitely lying.

38-Hina11.png

wrapper from the candy
I gave Sakura!
14-Hiro5.png

7-Hina16.png
: Ever since we got into the warehouse, I totally monopolized that entire box of candy.
11-Hina15.png
: So there's no way a single one of them was left in the warehouse!
40-Makoto28.png
: In that case, Hiro...where *did* you get that piece of candy?
11-Hina15.png
: From Sakura! It's the only explanation!
14-Hiro5.png
: U-Umm... W-Well, I mean...yeah, sure I got it from her, but...
42-Hiro16.png
: But she gave it to me forever ago! It doesn't have anything to do with what happened to her!
7-Hina16.png
: When? When did she give it to you?
36-Makoto2.png
: The last time you saw Sakura was...when Hina had to go to the nurse's office, right?
14-Hiro5.png
: Y-Yeah, so I musta got it...some time before then.
But...what Hiro said can't be right. Because Sakura could only have gotten the candy *after* the incident in the nurse's office. And the reason I know that is...
> When Sakura got that candy
40-Makoto28.png
: I'm not sure about that, Hiro... Hina didn't actually give Sakura the candy till

after she left the nurse's office

60-Kyoko17.png
: But if you recall, Hina was very adamant about keeping you away from the scene of the crime. So it's hard to believe that's when you actually saw the message for yourself.
Huh? Hold on... But when Kyoko found the magazine with the dying message in it, it was...

after we'd started the investigation

No, there's definitely something wrong with what Hiro said just now.

too thin

There's no doubt that the arrow is the murder weapon. But there's more to it than that...

16-Makoto30.png

another weapon

21-Makoto25.png
: Inside the dojo locker, we also found a balled-up wad of

duct tape
.
16-Makoto30.png
: The killer probably used this duct tape to

bind
multiple arrows together. Bundling them together using the duct tape would easily create a

single weapon as think as a pipe
.
23-Makoto29.png
: And that's exactly what the killed did!
24-Toko.png
: It's similar to Aesop's fable about the bundle of sticks... One stick is weak, but put them together, and they become strong. It's meant to teach cooperation.
25-Hiro13.png
: Damn, that's harsh...
8-Toko12.png
: How is it harsh? Were you even listening?
27-Byakuya9.png
: Anyway, that explains the murder weapon. As for who the culprit is that stashed the weapon in the dojo locker...
5-Byakuya4.png

29-Kyoko2.png

30-Byakuya8.png

6-Hina9.png

20-Makoto28.png
: The two of them share certain kinds of knowledge, but their memories aren't linked, right?
23-Kyoko12.png
: I see... If their memories are separate...then even if one personality's forgotten, there's a chance the other may still have those memories.

68-Junko12.png

The memories that were stolen from us... If what Junko says is true--if we first came here two years ago... But the rest of us only remember getting here within the last few weeks or so... So the memories she took from us...

I want to think that, too. I don't want to believe it. But that's nothing but our desire. I don't want to believe... I want it to be impossible... But if it's the truth...then we have to accept it!

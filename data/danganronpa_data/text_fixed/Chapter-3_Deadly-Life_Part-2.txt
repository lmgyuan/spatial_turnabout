: We'll begin our search for the bodies in the Art Room.
6-Sakura3.png
: We need to search for the bodies that have disappeared. What happens after that...
8-Hina14.png
: Where could two dead bodies have disappeared to...?
*Rattle rattle*
11-Makoto2.png
: Huh...?
The door must be locked...
3-Narration.png
: Nothing but the first Justice Hammer in the Rec Room.
3-Narration.png
: Classroom 3-A is similarly empty.

18-Celeste17.png
: Makoto...!
19-Byakuya5.png
: Why are you just standing there? We need to get to the
repository
.
11-Makoto2.png
: Huh? You mean...!?
20-Celeste2.png
: ...I found them. Hifumi and Taka's bodies had both been hidden in the repository.
21-Byakuya14.png
: I've already told Hina and Sakura. We'll go on ahead... *leaves*
Their bodies were in the repository...?
Are the bodies here somewhere...?
Up ahead is...the repository. The doorknob turned...! I guess it's unlocked. Then I have no choice but to go inside...

Music fades out.

So I opened the door. And when I entered...
...I saw...

The two bodies that had disappeared were right there. The smell of blood made me gag... What I saw
before my eyes
was unquestionable, unavoidable, unwavering reality. And then...I heard the announcement for a second time.

*Ding dong, ding dong*
31-MonokumaTV.png
: A body has been discovered! After a certain amount of time, which you may use however you like, the
class trial
will begin!
33-MrMonokumasLesson.png
34-Monokuma.png
: And so here we are! Without further ado, let me give you all
the next Monokuma File
!
35-Monokuma4.png
: I was going to hand them out when you found the bodies the first time, but I thought something might happen. It was really hard to resist, but...turns out I was right!
19-Byakuya5.png
: Just hand it over already.
35-Monokuma4.png
: Now, make sure to investigate with all of your mental might and prepare for the class trial! Okay, see ya later! *leaves*

No Music.

37-Byakuya9.png
: Well then, now that we've found the bodies, all that's left is to uncover the culprit.
38-Hina16.png
: H-Hold on... How can you be so...so calm...? I mean, they're *dead*, ya know!?
40-WelcometoDespair.png
41-Hina18.png
: Dead! Gone forever! They're never coming back!
43-Hina17.png
: Awful... This is all just too awful!
Hina suddenly burst into tears. She clutched at Hifumi's lifeless body.
45-Hina26.png
: Wh-Who would do this...? Why...? WHYYY!?
Large, wet tears fell from her eyes. The tears landed on Hifumi's cheeks. If this were some world of make-believe, that might have been when hifumi opened his eyes. But this wasn't a movie.

No Music.

This wasn't...

54-Hifumi23.png
: Ng...
55-Makoto33.png
: He's alive again!?
54-Hifumi23.png
: Where...am I? Cold...so cold... Is...winter coming?
45-Hina26.png
: H-Hifumi! Wake up!
54-Hifumi23.png
: ...Huh? Ahh...that's right... I remember now... Hope's Peak...
45-Hina26.png
: Come on! You gotta wake up!
54-Hifumi23.png
: Before...I'd met you...all... I'd met...you all...
56-Byakuya.png
: His memories are all blending together. He has nothing useful to offer us...
54-Hifumi23.png
: Ahh...the light... It's... reaching out...to me... Like...the tail...of a comet...
45-Hina26.png
: Hey, Hifumi! Who was it? Who attacked you!? Who tried to kill you!?
54-Hifumi23.png
: Who...killed me...? That's right... I remember...their name...
54-Hifumi23.png
: Y...Yasu...hi...ro...
54-Hifumi23.png
: ...
His eyes closed. And they never opened again. Death for the second time... Absoulte, undeniable death.
2-BeautifulDeath.png
No matter how many more of Hina's tears splashed his face...there was no second miracle. Reality set in again.
61-Byakuya3.png
: This isn't some stereotypical fantasy world. Tears can't restore a person's vitality.
62-Celeste15.png
: You have no tears, do you? No blood in your veins, no calcium in your bones. At least you have your meat...
19-Byakuya5.png
: You're just angry. Going out of his way to return, just to leave us with those unnecessary dying words. Now this game has become exceedingly boring.
6-Sakura3.png
: He said...Yasuhiro, right?
64-Celeste8.png
: Yasuhiro Hagakure... That is the only person he could have been referring to.
56-Byakuya.png
: And with that, the case is solved.
Assaulting people, and even killing Taka and Hifumi... And then going so far as to hide their bodies... A criminal that hides his face behind a mask, and uses a bunch of giant wooden hammers... Is that what Hiro is...?
43-Hina17.png
: If it's true, I can't forgive him... No way can I ever forgive him! To kill two of our friends...!
66-Byakuya7.png
: Anyway, it's about time we tracked down the culprit in our little life-or-death game here.
67-Byakuya15.png
: Although...this time it's not all that life-or-death. The trial will conclude without much trouble.
62-Celeste15.png
: Yes, it does look that way.
11-Makoto2.png
: ...
It's going to begin again. We have to go through this...one more time. ...I have to accept it... I have no choice but to go through with this. To make sure everyone survives... I just have to do it!

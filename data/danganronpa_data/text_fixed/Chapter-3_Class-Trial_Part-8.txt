: Once again, the post-trial scenes have unique voices and animations so a video has been provided if you'd like to watch this portion of the trial instead of reading it.

5-Monokuma.png
: It's basically a formality at this point, but once again you're totally correct! The blackened this time...the true killer who devised the whole stinkin' scheme, was...
6-Monokuma5.png
: Celestia Ludenburg! Or more precisely...Taeko Yasuhiroooo!
8-Celeste15.png
: I lost... Well, that sucks. I guess trying to work with someone else was a mistake, after all. Hifumi's ineptitude was beyond all my calculations.
9-Kyoko17.png
: So you really did approach Hifumi with this plan? But how did you get him to agree? I can't imagine he would have happily agreed to commit murder.
10-Byakuya.png
: I'm sure she relied on her specialty--lying.
11-Celeste3.png
: My specialty? Don't make me laugh. I didn't have to lie to get him to agree.
13-Kyoko7.png
: Then did you use...you know...?
8-Celeste15.png
: I knew you'd figure it out, Kyoko. You're absolutely right. To get Hifumi to act as my accomplice...
14-Celeste16.png
: ...I used "

her
". For everyone who's still left, I'll avoid mentioning it by name, but it was the one thing Hifumi and Taka were both super into.
15-Makoto2.png
: Does she mean...?
Is she talking about...Alter Ego?
17-Monokuma11.png
: What? What what what!? What are you talking about!?
13-Kyoko7.png
: Don't interrupt. We're in the middle of a very important conversation here.
18-Monokuma8.png
: I'm totally out of the loop, as usual. How sad...
13-Kyoko7.png
: Then you're the one that stole it?
20-Celeste.png
: That's right.
9-Kyoko17.png
: And you used it to drag Hifumi into the plan you'd come up with.
11-Celeste3.png
: Right again. Last night, after we had our meeting about how it'd disappeared, I paid Hifumi a little visit.
21-Flashback.png
23-AllStarApologies.png
24-Hifumi2.png
: Oh, um...what are you doing here?
25-Celeste17.png
: I was hoping I could talk to you. Alone. It is about what was stolen. I know who did it...
26-Hifumi10.png
: What...?
25-Celeste17.png
: It was Taka. He stole it.
27-Hifumi11.png
: What!?
28-Celeste2.png
: And I have proof. Would you like to see it?
25-Celeste17.png
:
As it turned out, I'd found a use for the digital camera. I'd taken you-know-what to Taka's room earlier and took pictures of it there. I deleted the picture as soon as I'd shown it to Hifumi, of course.
31-Hifumi12.png
: Grrn... So it WAS him! But how did he do it!? She was supposed to yell if either of us got close to her!
32-Celeste5.png
: You are correct. Which is why Taka forced me to steal it.
27-Hifumi11.png
: Whaaaaaat!?
32-Celeste5.png
: Please forgive me. He...he threatened me.
33-Hifumi6.png
: H-He did...?
32-Celeste5.png
: He came to my room last night unannounced, and then... It's hard for me to even say... He...abused me...
26-Hifumi10.png
: What!?
32-Celeste5.png
: And he...he took pictures. He said if I did not do as he asked, he would show them to everyone... So I...I had no choice...
31-Hifumi12.png
: Th-That's a crime! An absolute crime! He...! I mean, I knew he'd gone a little crazy, but...!
35-Hifumi13.png
: I never imagined he would...would go that far!
36-Celeste4.png
:
It was amazing how completely he bought it. Hmhm... I can't express how enjoyable that was.
31-Hifumi12.png
: I'm about to say something I've never said before in my life...
35-Hifumi13.png
: I'm going to kill him! I'm going to f...f...f-fucking kill him!
8-Celeste15.png
: Wait, please! If you go now, you will be playing right into his hands!
24-Hifumi2.png
: Huh...?
32-Celeste5.png
: Taka is planning to use her...to escape. And he has made *you* his target...
33-Hifumi6.png
: Escape? You don't mean...?
8-Celeste15.png
: Taka is going to try to kill you.
39-Hifumi8.png
: Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!?
32-Celeste5.png
: And all so he can keep her to himself...
31-Hifumi12.png
: Th-That bastard!
40-Hifumi14.png
: Bastard bastard bastard BASTARD!
32-Celeste5.png
: Can we allow him to continue with these barbaric acts?
31-Hifumi12.png
: Absolutely not! How could I!? She...she...
35-Hifumi13.png
: I have to save heeeeeerr!!!
42-DespairSyndrome2.png
14-Celeste16.png
: Then...would you like to join with me? It just so happens, I have come up with a plan...
33-Hifumi6.png
: Huh...?
11-Celeste3.png
: I have devised a way to reclaim what he has stolen, and escape this dreadful school.
36-Celeste4.png
: Hmhm... Hehehehe...
25-Celeste17.png
: And with that, it is complete...
44-Hifumi9.png
: Huh? What are you talking about?
28-Celeste2.png
: Oh, nothing...
21-Flashback.png
3-BeautifulDeath.png
46-Celeste8.png
: Hifumi agreed without a second thought. Hmhm. The effect that item had on him was...remarkable. The power of love... Even a love as twisted as that can still drive people mad, it would seem.
47-Hiro5.png
: You disgust me...
48-Byakuya9.png
: I have another question for you. Was that strange costume Hifumi's creation?
46-Celeste8.png
: Yeah. It was a real pain in the butt, too. All I asked him to do was make something to hide the face and general body size. I had no idea he'd make something like...that. But it's my fault for picking him in the first place.
47-Hiro5.png
: So...why'd you decide to make me the suspect?
28-Celeste2.png
: Because you're stupid.
50-Hiro7.png
: That's it!?
51-Celeste9.png
: And in that regard, I made the right choice. I'm so glad your stupidity surpassed my every expectation.
36-Celeste4.png
: Life must have been tough on your parents, though.
52-Hiro13.png
: I feel like I could cry...
54-Sakura3.png
: But when you were explaining your plan to Hifumi, how did you explain the part about him playing dead?
10-Byakuya.png
: What she's asking is, what was Hifumi supposed to do after that, assuming you had actually let him live?
55-Celeste7.png
: That's simple. After he did his part and pretended to be dead, once someone showed up I told him to say he'd been seriously wounded, he was on the verge of death, but he just barely held on.
56-Hina2.png
: And he really believed that?
20-Celeste.png
: Well of course, that wasn't all there was to it. As I explained it to Hifumi, the plan was... while you were all questioning him about what had happened to him, I was going to murder someone else. At that point, Hifumi would have an alibi, so nobody could doubt him. I told him that, and he believed it.
10-Byakuya.png
: It all seems very...straightforward. Stereotypical.
51-Celeste9.png
: I just matched the lie to the level of the opponent. In fact, Hifumi ate it up. He believed the lie wholeheartedly, right up until the moment of his death.
58-Sakura5.png
: So you had planned to kill him all along!
36-Celeste4.png
: ...But of course. There would have been no point to my plan if the one who pretended to be dead did not end up dead himself.
60-Hina16.png
: How can human life mean so little to you...?
61-Celeste6.png
: That's a non-issue. I simply did everything in my power to win.
62-Hiro16.png
: Now you sound like Byakuya!
46-Celeste8.png
: No, he derives his pleasure from the thrill of the hunt. In that aspect, we are nothing alike.
64-Kyoko13.png
: Then...what made you take things this far?
60-Hina16.png
: Was it really...just for money?
46-Celeste8.png
: Are you talking about the ten million dollars Monokuma offered us? That *is* a lot of money, it's true.
28-Celeste2.png
: But that's not all there is to it. From the moment our new life here began, my only thought has been escape.
47-Hiro5.png
: B-But...all along you've been saying how we have to accept living here!
66-Celeste10.png
: Obviously that was a lie!
67-Hiro8.png
: Hyah!
66-Celeste10.png
: I couldn't take it! I hated it from day one! More than anyone anyone ANYONE else in here!
69-Celeste11.png
: I wanted to get out! Every day was fresh torture! And do you wanna know why? HUH!?
36-Celeste4.png
: Because...I had a dream. And accepting a life here would have meant nothing less than giving up on my dream forever...
8-Celeste15.png
: And there was no way...that I could ever do that. In the underground world of gambling, I risked my life to make a metaphorical killing.
32-Celeste5.png
: And it was all for that dream...
15-Makoto2.png
: And what was this dream of yours...?
71-100MileJunkFoodDash.png
36-Celeste4.png
: To live in a European castle.
15-Makoto2.png
: A c-castle!?
36-Celeste4.png
: And to gather handsome men from all over the world to server as my butlers-slash-bodyguards. I was going to make them dress up like vampires and satisfy my every need. Once I obtained that, I would have created a perfectly asthetic world of decadence... Living the rest of my life there was my only dream, my only goal... That's what life is all ABOUT!
3-BeautifulDeath.png
28-Celeste2.png
: Combined with my own winnings, Monokuma's ten million dollars would have made that dream a reality. I got right to the edge, but...
8-Celeste15.png
: Unfortunately, my dream has been scattered to the wind. Still, I don't have any regrets. I pursued my dream till the very end, so why would I?
60-Hina16.png
: You sound so passionate, but...you were really able to kill your own friends for it?
61-Celeste6.png
: Are you asking me to feel guilty? That's a pointless endeavor. I think nothing of sacrificing others for my own ends. I feel nothing.
14-Celeste16.png
: That's all there is to me. That's what makes me...complete.
11-Celeste3.png
: Hmhm. Isn't it terrifying how different our values are? There's simply no room for understanding.
75-Hina17.png
: Th-That's what *we* should be saying. And plus... how can you be so calm? Don't you realize you're about to die? Why aren't you scared...?
36-Celeste4.png
: Hmph. My ability to lie is unrivaled, and I take pride in that. It's not just other people--I can even fool my own emotions. The conscious deceives the unconscious.
15-Makoto2.png
: And that's why you're not scared?
46-Celeste8.png
: That's right. I don't fear death. Kill me however you like. But you know, if I could be reincarnated... If I had a choice, then...
36-Celeste4.png
: ...I think I would like to come back as Marie Antoinette.
77-Hiro4.png
: You'd just get executed again...
11-Celeste3.png
: Hmhm. Hehe...hehehe.

Celeste smiled then... And when she did, it looked to me like a poor effort to force it. She claimed she could fool her own feelings. But that statement itself...must have been her final lie. And that weak, fake smile...is what betrayed her.

80-Monokuma12.png
: You all done? Okay, then let's get rollin'! The blackened disturbed the peace, and must pay the price!
6-Monokuma5.png
: Now then, I've prepared a very special punishment for...her! The Ultimate Gambler! Let's give it everything we've got! It's...PUNISHMENT TIIIME!

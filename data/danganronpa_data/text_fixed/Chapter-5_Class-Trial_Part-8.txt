The massive high school towers over all the other buildings in this bustling urban area. It's like the school stands at the center of the entire world.
It brings in top students from every field imaginable. A government-funded school of privilege... They say that if you come here and manage to graduate, you'll be set for life. With hundreds of years of tradition, it sends the cream of the crop into the work force every year. It was built to raise
**
hope
in the nation's future. Which makes
**
Hope's Peak
a pretty fitting name.
There are two things you need to attend this school... One, you have to already be attending high school. Two, you have to be the very best at what you do. No ordinary student could enroll here.  The only way in is if you're scouted by the school itself.
And standing there at the gate of the ultimate school filled with the ultimate students...
...was me.

: ............Nng?
12-Makoto12.png
: Wh-What...? Where am I?
I woke up with my head resting on top of a hard wooden desk.  My body felt...heavy.  It's pretty normal for me to zonk off in the middle of some boring class or whatever, but... What was I doing asleep here just now? This isn't a classroom I've ever been in before.
12-Makoto12.png
: What the heck is going on...?
...
9-Makoto2.png
: Gh...!
Finally... I could finally feel my mind and body start to come back together again. And then...I was awake. Or...was this just another dream?
A dream...inside a hopeless nightmare.
9-Makoto2.png
: No...this isn't a dream.
I could tell, because the stench invading my nostrils was too powerful for a dream.
9-Makoto2.png
: What an awful smell...
I was in a vast, dark cavern, with the barest hint of light seeping in. Trash was piled high all across the area.
9-Makoto2.png
: This must be some kind of...
**
underground garbage pit
.
A heck of a situation to find myself in. But that was just the beginning of my problems... Was I going to be stuck in there till I wasted away and died?
9-Makoto2.png
: No, I can't let that happen...! Not after what my good friend went through to save me!
I remembered all too well what had happened.
15-FlashT.png
17-FlashB.png
Alter Ego...saved me. And he used up the last little bit of strength to do it...
9-Makoto2.png
: So I can't give up now! For myself, and for my friend!
And with that, my pursuit of survival began... First up was to start looking for a way out of there.
19-DespairSyndrome2.png
That's...a rocket, and a tank... I'd better not think too much about what I'm seeing down here.
This is...a desk. It's probably the one that fell down with me.
Is that...an airplane? How'd something like that wind up in the school's garbage pit?
*Rattle rattle*
It's locked...
*Rattle rattle*
No matter how many times I pushed or pulled or kicked at it, it didn't budge.
9-Makoto2.png
: Getting out of here isn't gonna be that easy...
Well, if I'm not getting out of here anytime soon...
I decided to look around for some food.
9-Makoto2.png
: There's plenty of food here, but it's all rotten...
But that was pointless, too.
Next I searched for some water.
9-Makoto2.png
: How can I be sure which liquids I can drink, and which ones are an all-around bad idea...?
Again, pointless...
9-Makoto2.png
: I feel like I'm blocked in on all sides.
But that's still not enough reason to give up. Because...!
9-Makoto2.png
: Because I'm still alive! As long as I'm alive, I'll never give up!
After making that proud declaration, the next thing I decided to do was...
8-DespairSyndrome1.png
...go to sleep.
My sleep was deep and uninterrupted. That was my only way to preserve what little strength I had left, after not being able to eat or drink. I can't be sure, but I think at least a full day had to have passed. And all I did was sleep and sleep...
It was like I was waiting for some kind of sign to come falling out of the sky. However... What fell from the sky wasn't a sign. Not exactly...
*GACRUNCH*
30-BoysLifeofDespair.png
9-Makoto2.png
: What the--!?
The strange sound pierced my silent isolation, jarring me awake.
As I watched, the pile of garbage jostled and formed an odd shape...
9-Makoto2.png
: Did

something fall down
over there...?
Something fell from up above... What could it have been?
9-Makoto2.png
: Did a giant piece of trash just fall down here...?
I carefully stretched my hand out toward whatever it was that had tumbled down here with me...

She gave her head a quick, sharp shake to get rid of the trash, then faced me again...

: Go ahead and eat it. We can talk once you're finished.

I snatched the bread and water that she was holding out for me. Within seconds, it was in my mouth and making its way toward my stomach.
39-Makoto.png
: Whew, that really hit the spot! Now I've got all the energy I need to keep going!
45-Kyoko5.png
: So you still haven't given up, then.
39-Makoto.png
: Of course not! After all, the fact that I can keep going forward is about all I'm good at...
45-Kyoko5.png

39-Makoto.png
: But Kyoko... Why'd you come to rescue me?
47-AllStarApologies.png
48-Kyoko17.png
: To pay a debt. Or, no...to atone.
39-Makoto.png
: Atone...?

The first thing...?

: You're talking about when we

fainted
, right? I fainted, and when I woke up...I was trapped here.
42-Kyoko2.png
: I fainted, too. And when *I* woke up...I noticed a strange feeling of...separation within myself. A disconnect.
49-Kyoko7.png
: Thinking back on it now, at that point my memory was gone. At that time...I'd forgotten. I couldn't remember why I'd come to this school, and I couldn't remember what my "ultimate" ability was.
39-Makoto.png
: But...what would make you forget all that?
42-Kyoko2.png
: Strange, isn't it? It's hard to imagine it happened by chance. It seems much too convenient.
39-Makoto.png
: Are you saying you think you lost your memory because...?
57-DISTRUST.png
49-Kyoko7.png
: I don't think. I'm positive it was
**
the work of the mastermind
. They stole my memory...
39-Makoto.png
: B-But...why would they want to do that?
49-Kyoko7.png
: There's only one reason I can come up with. Because of my purpose, and my ability. Somehow, they would interfere with the mastermind's plans.
So the mastermind just...stole them from you?
59-Kyoko13.png
: And it could also mean...somehow, my memories may be connected to the mystery of this school, and the mastermind. Which is why I have to get them back. That's why I've been investigating things by myself this whole time.
39-Makoto.png
: But if what you say is true, why didn't you ask the rest of us to help you?
48-Kyoko17.png
: If I did that, and we all worked as one, the mastermind would have noticed right away. Plus... There's always the chance that the mastermind is actually one of us...
39-Makoto.png
: What...?
48-Kyoko17.png
: Well, don't make too big a deal of it. It's just a possibility. But since it *is* a possibility, we can't ignore it, right?
The mastermind...one of us... If she believed that, then of course she couldn't trust anyone around her. In which case, it only makes sense that she would look into her missing memory by herself.
56-Kyoko.png
: That being said, there was a limit to what I could do by myself. Which is why I asked you to help me.
39-Makoto.png
: But...why me?
45-Kyoko5.png
: Because among everyone, you were least likely to be the mastermind. That was just intuition, but...
39-Makoto.png
: I-I see... Your intuition was right, though. There's no way an ordinary kid like me could've been the mastermind.

48-Kyoko17.png
: But listen, Makoto. I want to make this perfectly clear, so there's no misunderstanding...
56-Kyoko.png
: I said the headmaster wasn't the mastermind, but I didn't say that to protect him. I only said what I felt based on what I'd seen when I snuck into the headmaster's room.
39-Makoto.png
: Then...what did you see in there?
19-DespairSyndrome2.png
71-Kyoko11.png
: The room had been ransacked. The shelves were a mess, the desk drawers dumped on the floor... The only conclusion is that someone who didn't know where anything was had been in there.
39-Makoto.png
: You mean...the mastermind, right?
48-Kyoko17.png
: That was my assumption, yes. And to confirm my suspicion...
48-Kyoko17.png
: ...I decided to investigate the 2nd floor of the dorms using the key I'd found.
39-Makoto.png
: But...why there?
56-Kyoko.png
: Because I also found this in the headmaster's room.
39-Makoto.png
: This is...some kind of map?
71-Kyoko11.png
: It's a layout of

the entirety of Hope's Peak Academy
. I found it in the headmaster's room, along with Mukuro's profile and that key. The map showed that the 2nd floor was home to a number of rooms meant for faculty use. Some of the staff must have had to stay overnight from time to time. And I figured the headmaster would have some kind of private room there... I assumed that if that were true, that room would likely hold more clues. So I went to check...
48-Kyoko17.png
: And that's when I finally remembered. I remembered that my purpose was to find the owner of that room.
39-Makoto.png
: So you went there to see if the headmaster really did have a private room there...

: The mastermind is adamant about following the rules, and with that rule in place, they couldn't step in. Since they couldn't kill me themselves, they tried to use the class trial to do it.

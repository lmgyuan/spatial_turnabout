When I got back to the dining hall, the first thing I noticed was...
3-100MileJunkFoodDash.png
4-Hina12.png
: Ah--!
5-Makoto.png
: Hina!?
I tried to talk to her, but my voice was immediately drowned out by the others as they rushed into the dining hall.
7-Sakura5.png
: Hina!
8-Hiro7.png
: Huh? I thought she was sick or somethin'.
Everyone rushed past me and crowded around Hina. Being surrounded by everyone like that, Hina looked really uncomfortable.
7-Sakura5.png
: Are you feeling better already?
9-Hina6.png
: Y-Yeah... I ate a few donuts, and that really helped a lot.
5-Makoto.png
: You do love those donuts...
11-Celeste7.png
: But...wasn't it your stomach that was hurting?
12-Hina9.png
: Well, my stomachache kinda made me hungry, so...you know...
9-Hina6.png
: Er, ahaha...I guess my memory's kinda fuzzy lately...
13-Hifumi17.png
: They say that a goldfish will eat however much food you give it, even if it's about to burst. Miss Asahina's pretty much the same, it looks like.
15-Hina15.png
: Hey! You of all people don't have any room to talk!
16-Sakura4.png
: Anyway... I was worried about you.
17-Hina14.png
: S-Sorry...
19-Jill.png
: Besides that, you--!
20-Hina2.png
: H-Huh...?
21-Jill5.png
: Jeez, your knockers are HUGE! What the heck, did you convince them to double up on milk production!?
23-Sakura11.png
: Stay away from her, fiend.
24-Narration.png
: Had you noticed this Japanese game was so far lacking in boob jokes? Well don't worry, Jill has you covered.
26-Hiro5.png
: A-Anyway...first thing's first, we should talk about what we found. Right, Taka?
27-Taka19.png
: ...
28-Hiro2.png
: ...Right.
30-BeautifulDeath.png
24-Narration.png
: We have to speak with everyone to progress the story. We may as well begin with Hina.
20-Hina2.png
: Um, I wasn't able to help much with the investigation, but...I did make one discovery...
32-Hiro12.png
: It didn't happen to be a donut-related discovery, did it?
33-Hina19.png
: What does that even mean? Never mind... It's about the nurse's office! Remember? There's one on the 1st floor, right?
34-Sakura3.png
: I remember. But it's locked.
36-Hina22.png
: Actually...not anymore.
37-Sakura7.png
: Did you find any protein in there? Or even vitamin supplements would be fine.
33-Hina19.png
: I did look, but no dice... Just a bunch of headache medicine and over-the-counter stuff.
16-Sakura4.png
: I see... That's disappointing.
17-Hina14.png
: It *is* disappointing. Like the end of the world is already here...
I-I'm not sure it's *that* disappointing...
40-Jill9.png
: The long road to maidenhood begins with a single step... That road may begin with only wrinkly old men, but it will end with strapping young adorable boys!
41-Hiro14.png
: What the hell are you talking about...?
42-Jill3.png
: Kyeehahaha!
44-Kyoko2.png
: There was a rather remarkable physics lab on the 3rd floor. In the middle of the room, there was a machine bigger than anything I've ever seen before...
5-Makoto.png
: Oh yeah, apparently it's an air purifier.
8-Hiro7.png
: Huh? What's something like that doing there?
34-Sakura3.png
: Is the device really that big?
20-Hina2.png
: I...really don't get it.
27-Taka19.png
: ...
32-Hiro12.png
: Oh, I just remembered! I saw Byakuya a little while ago.
19-Jill.png
: What!?
48-Jill8.png
: Where!? WHERE WAS HE!?!?
49-Hiro8.png
: Y-You're kinda scarin' me...
48-Jill8.png
: Where. Was. HE!?
26-Hiro5.png
: He was in the locker room... He had a huge stack of books he musta got from the library.
50-Jill4.png
: So THAT'S where he was hiding! I won't let him get away from me! Kyehehe... *leaves*
26-Hiro5.png
: She just...ran off!
5-Makoto.png
: Is...is she okay?
52-Celeste4.png
: We should not concern ourselves with her.
27-Taka19.png
: ... ...
It's no use...
57-Celeste3.png
: There *is* one piece of good news. There just so happens to be a rec room up on the 3rd floor! I have no doubt that our student life here will be even more enjoyable because of it.
52-Celeste4.png
: Hmhm. Will someone join me in a game of Othello sometime?
60-Sakura.png
: I searched the entire 3rd floor, but...all the windows in the halls and the rooms were blocked off.
61-Hiro13.png
: I wish they'd give this a rest already, for serious! Gimme back my bright blue skies!
52-Celeste4.png
: Just forget about it.
61-Hiro13.png
: You make it sound like I dropped a nickel or something!
34-Sakura3.png
: Just to be sure, I went from one end to the other, testing each metal plate. None of them budged. It would seem escape via the 3rd floor is as impossible as we feared...
5-Makoto.png
: I see...
64-Hifumi4.png
: There was an art room on the 3rd floor, and it had all kinds of gear. Myehehe... Now I'll be able to recreate all my favorite
[anime characters]
!
> anime characters
5-Makoto.png
: Oh yeah! Speaking of anime, that reminds me... I found something while I was looking around!
60-Sakura.png
: Hrm...a digital camera?
5-Makoto.png
: That's what it seems like...
28-Hiro2.png
: Does it still work?
5-Makoto.png
: Yeah, it seems fine.
66-Hiro.png
: Well then, let's see it!
41-Hiro14.png
: What the heck? This thing is like a kid's toy! It looks like it can store like five pictures, maybe? It doesn't have a timer or anything!
68-Celeste6.png
: On top of that, its appearance seems...questionable. Is this some kind of anime character? Strange...
69-Hifumi13.png
: Rude! She's not strange! She's Princess Piggles, from
"Demon Angelâ˜†Pretty Pudgy Princess"
!
5-Makoto.png
: Oh, you recognize this, Hifumi?
70-Hifumi12.png
: Of course I recognize it! It's a super rare prize that was given away at a bingo contest at a big anime convention... You have any idea how much I had to pay that guy to get my hands on it!?
72-Hifumi10.png
: Wait...that's my camera!
5-Makoto.png
: What!?
70-Hifumi12.png
: Wh-Where did you find it!?
5-Makoto.png
: In the physics lab...
70-Hifumi12.png
: It's my most prized possession. I brought it here with me, but I lost it the first day, along with my phone.
74-Celeste8.png
: Why would it have reappeared in the physics lab...?
70-Hifumi12.png
: Agh, but look at it! It got all messed up!
76-Hifumi6.png
: Like when someone steals a sticker from your collection, or you buy a secondhand shirt... Well, that's it...
5-Makoto.png
: Huh? That's it...?
70-Hifumi12.png
: It's not mint condition. I don't need it anymore...
5-Makoto.png
: But weren't you just saying how much it meant to you?
52-Celeste4.png
: Then...may *I* have it? I might be able to find some sort of use for it. If any of you would like to borrow it, please feel free to ask.
78-Hina20.png
: Well...I can't really imagine any of us are gonna need to take any pictures or whatever...
5-Makoto.png
: Yeah, true...
Okay, I've heard what everyone else has to say. So now it's my turn...!
80-Makoto2.png
: Hey, um...can I tell you guys something? I found something that's...kinda been bothering me.
82-Kyoko9.png
: What is it?
80-Makoto2.png
: I found this weird picture in the repository. Apparently Monokuma took it...
4-Hina12.png
: A weird picture? You mean, like...dirty!?
80-Makoto2.png
: No, not that kind of weird. It was...a picture of Leon, Mondo, and Chihiro all together.
84-DISTRUST.png
85-Kyoko13.png
: Those three...?
80-Makoto2.png
: And the three of them were...laughing.
76-Hifumi6.png
: It showed the three of them together, laughing? When could it have been taken?
80-Makoto2.png
: And there's more... In the picture, there weren't any metal sheets covering the windows.
37-Sakura7.png
: Then...the picture wasn't taken here?
74-Celeste8.png
: But I don't recall hearing anything about them knowing each other before coming to this school.
87-Hifumi2.png
: You probably just imagined it! Monokuma cast a spell on you!
80-Makoto2.png
: No! I saw it, I'm telling you!
20-Hina2.png
: But if it wasn't taken before we got here, or *after* we got here...
88-Hiro15.png
: I bet they're all still alive! They left the school and then took that picture!
44-Kyoko2.png
: That's impossible. After all...
90-Kyoko.png
: ...we saw it with our own eyes.
90-Kyoko.png
: They're all dead.
90-Kyoko.png
: Either murdered or executed...
And they're not the only ones...
Monokuma killed Junko. And then there's...
...Sayaka. *That* wasn't an illusion. It was real, I'm sure of it. They all died. There's no way any of them are still alive.
80-Makoto2.png
: So we have to figure out when that picture was taken...
96-Celeste9.png
: Monokuma most likely forged it. I can't imagine any other possibility.
Forged...? Is that all there is to it?
41-Hiro14.png
: Stay focused, man! Don't let Monokuma's bullcrap sidetrack you!
98-Celeste.png
: He's right. But more importantly...
52-Celeste4.png
: On another topic, there is something that has been
[bothering me]
. I would like to discuss that.
> bothering me
5-Makoto.png
: What's bothering you, Celeste?
99-Celeste2.png
: It's about Hina...
101-DespairSyndrome2.png
102-Hina11.png
: What? Me!?
52-Celeste4.png
: You said your stomach hurt, did you not? But I believe that was a lie. What really happened?
4-Hina12.png
: Huh?
103-Celeste15.png
: It varies from person to person, but whenever someone lies, they tend to have a way of showing it. It is called a "tell"--something that you can't hide, no matter how hard you try.
104-Celeste16.png
: Whenever Hina lies, the tip of her nose gets just a little bit longer.
106-Hina10.png
: What!? For real!?
52-Celeste4.png
: Actually, no.
4-Hina12.png
: Huh...?
98-Celeste.png
: But your reaction just now confirmed it--you *were* lying.
106-Hina10.png
: Th-That's no fair!
57-Celeste3.png
: Hmhm. If you are going to lie, at least try to lie convincingly.
34-Sakura3.png
: Hina...be honest. Were you lying about your stomachache?
17-Hina14.png
: ... Y-Yes...
16-Sakura4.png
: Why...? Why would you lie about that?
109-Hifumi14.png
: Are you feeling guilty about something!?
110-Hina16.png
: No, that's not it at all!
17-Hina14.png
: It's just... I mean, I have a reason for it!
A reason...?
17-Hina14.png
: To be honest...I didn't have a stomachache. I did it cuz...even it I came and told you
[the truth]
, I thought you wouldn't believe me...
> the truth
5-Makoto.png
: The truth...?
17-Hina14.png
: ...I saw it.
5-Makoto.png
: Saw what...?
17-Hina14.png
: A ghost...
113-DespairSyndrome1.png
114-Hifumi9.png
: A ghost...? You mean like, THAT ghost!?
115-Kyoko3.png
: Is there more than one ghost...?
5-Makoto.png
: B-But...I mean, ghosts are...
110-Hina16.png
: See! I told you you wouldn't believe me!
5-Makoto.png
: I-It's not that I don't believe you, but...
34-Sakura3.png
: ...I believe you. No matter what anyone else might say, I will believe whatever you say, no matter what. So...can you tell us exactly what happened?
17-Hina14.png
: If you really mean that, Sakura...then okay. I'll tell you.
20-Hina2.png
: Umm, so...it happened last night.
117-Flashback.png
101-DespairSyndrome2.png
20-Hina2.png
: I was in bed, but I couldn't get to sleep. I just kept thinking about everything that's happened up till now. I ended up just getting more upset... So to try and cheer myself up, I thought I'd go get some donuts.
41-Hiro14.png
: Donuts again!?
103-Celeste15.png
: And you ignored the rule regarding nighttime...
17-Hina14.png
: I know, sorry. I feel really bad about that...
60-Sakura.png
: Anyway, please continue.
20-Hina2.png
: Well... So I left my room and headed for the warehouse...
20-Hina2.png
: But then I started hearing a strange sound...
*Grr grnnn*
*Grn grn grrnnn*
20-Hina2.png
: It was coming from the direction of the bathhouse. So I headed that way...
20-Hina2.png
: The locker was halfway open, so I took a look inside...
20-Hina2.png
: And I saw a human shape, surrounded by a pale green light. There's no doubt who it was... It was Chihiro!
117-Flashback.png
124-BoysLifeofDespair.png
125-Hifumi8.png
: KYAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!
126-Hiro9.png
: N-No way...! A gh-gh-gh-ghost!?
74-Celeste8.png
: It is simply not possible. You must be mistaken. Just as in most cases of "paranormal" activity, it was born from your weakened mental state.
34-Sakura3.png
: Then all we have to do is go see for ourselves, right? Let's just go to the bathhouse and see what Hina saw.
96-Celeste9.png
: It is a waste of time.
5-Makoto.png
: Maybe, but...there's no harm in it, right? If we don't find anything, that'll be the end of it.
128-Hiro6.png
: You're gonna go try and see a gh-gh-ghost...? Is that really a good idea? It might put a curse on you!
110-Hina16.png
: You can wait here if you want.
129-Hiro10.png
: I don't wanna be alone! Take me with you!
90-Kyoko.png
: What are you going to do, Celeste?
103-Celeste15.png
: I suppose I have no choice...
87-Hifumi2.png
: How about you, Mr. Ishimaru? Are you gonna wait here?
27-Taka19.png
: ...
132-Hifumi18.png
: ...I guess that's a yes.

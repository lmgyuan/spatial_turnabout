: We've been instructed to meet in the gym. Before we go however there are still a few stragglers in the halls.
5-Makoto2.png
: Oh, Kyoko! Did you hear the announcement just now?
6-Kyoko2.png
: Yes...
5-Makoto2.png
: I don't want to go, but...we don't have any other choice, right?
7-Kyoko17.png
: I can't imagine it's going to be good news. But it's not a good idea to defy him here and now...
8-Kyoko19.png
: So I'm going on ahead. *leaves*
I can't really do anything except what Monokuma tells me...
11-Mondo.png
: Hey, man. You about to head in?
5-Makoto2.png
: Yeah. Has everyone already gone on ahead?
12-Mondo2.png
: Looks that way. I don't like it, but nothing good's gonna come from ignoring that goddamn bear.
5-Makoto2.png
: Um, Mondo...? Are you sure you're okay? You kinda went all-out in that sauna...
14-Mondo5.png
: Huh? Who went all-out? That shit doesn't even faze me!
15-Mondo12.png
: But ya know...
17-Mondo4.png
: There at the edge of hell...a promise between men was waiting for me. Never saw it comin'...
18-Mondo16.png
: Anyway! Let's get out asses into the gym. *leaves*
Man, something...unique must've happened between the two of them.
3-Narration.png
: In the gym lobby, Hifumi has yet to work up the courage to go in.
5-Makoto2.png
: Hey, Hifumi. How come you haven't gone in yet?
21-Hifumi10.png
: Huwayah!?
22-Hifumi12.png
: Mr. Naegi! Don't scare me like that!
5-Makoto2.png
: S-Sorry... But we really should go inside.
24-Hifumi18.png
: No, don't go... You can't go!
25-Hifumi5.png
: That's what my ghost friend is telling me...
5-Makoto2.png
: I don't feel good about it either, but...we can't just ignore this.
22-Hifumi12.png
: Damn...that's true, too!
27-Hifumi19.png
: I guess we have no choice... *leaves*
I have to go, too.
30-Taka16.png
: Hmm... Asking us to gather together all of a sudden like this... What could he possibly want?
31-Celeste2.png
: Indeed. What might await us this time?
32-Byakuya3.png
: Hmhmhm. He keeps things interesting, that's for certain.
34-Hifumi2.png
: How is that funny? Can't you smile like a normal person once in a while? Like how the housewife on a classic TV show smiles at the end of an episode?
35-Hina16.png
: There's something totally messed up with you if you can laugh at a time like this!
37-Byakuya7.png
: Which of us is *actually* "messed up," hmm?
38-Hina9.png
: Wh-What's that supposed to mean...?
39-Byakuya.png
: Nothing in particular. Just admiring, that's all. I don't want to kill anyone. But I also don't want to stay here, living in blind denial day after day.
32-Byakuya3.png
: I was just admiring how you could live like that and still keep your sanity.
35-Hina16.png
: I'm not in denial...
32-Byakuya3.png
: That reminds me. Remember how you kept talking about how the
police
or whoever would come help us? How'd that turn out? It seems to me there's no sign whatsoever of possible rescue.
38-Hina9.png
: Th-That's just...
41-Hina10.png
: ...I wonder what actually happened.
43-Kyoko12.png
: It's strange, that's true. There's no way the police wouldn't know about it. We're right in the middle of a major urban area.
44-Hifumi14.png
: The police suck!
45-Celeste7.png
: On the contrary, the mastermind may be just that powerful, to take control even of the police...
47-DespairSyndrome2.png
48-Hiro12.png
: Oh! This might not be related, but--
49-Toko4.png
: Then don't say it.
50-Hiro2.png
: Nope, gonna say it!
48-Hiro12.png
: It's about last night. I was near the
main hall
just staring off into space. When all of a sudden, I
heard it
.
51-Chihiro5.png
: You heard what?
48-Hiro12.png
: A sound that... I don't really know what it was...
52-Taka2.png
: Wh-What kind of sound?
50-Hiro2.png
: Well like I said, I don't really know. But if I *had* to describe it...
48-Hiro12.png
: ...it was like...a
construction site
, I guess?
5-Makoto2.png
: A construction site?
48-Hiro12.png
: I mean, I could just be making that up. I only just barely heard anything...
54-Toko.png
: Then you d-definitely made it up. M-Must've just been the sound of the ocean in th-that head of your...

57-MrMonokumasLesson.png
58-Kyoko7.png
: He's arrived...
60-Monokuma12.png
: What Hiro heard wasn't the sound of construction...but it *could* have been an
explosion
!
5-Makoto2.png
: Huh?
60-Monokuma12.png
: Or maybe a
machine gun
! Puhuhu... That can kinda sound like construction in a way!
5-Makoto2.png
: What are you talking about...?
62-Monokuma4.png
: Ah-ah-ah! Beyond this point my mouth is zipped, my lips are sealed, I am fully puckered! It's a secret little secret!
63-Kyoko13.png
: Fine, then let's move on to what you *can* tell us. Why did you call us all here?
65-Monokuma11.png
: You don't beat around the ol' bush, do ya!? Ready for me to get to the point, huh?
66-Monokuma13.png
: But before that, you mind if I vent a little?
68-Monokuma9.png
: I'm low on energy these days. My stitching's even losing all its shine and luster... I'm thinking, it's probably because of this ho-hum, boring old everyday life.
69-Monokuma2.png
: I'm looking for something with a little more stimulation, something rife with danger and intrigue!
70-Monokuma.png
: Listen, can I just be frank?
72-MrMonokumaAfterClass.png
73-Monokuma6.png
: The next blackened hasn't shown up yet, and I'm getting booooored!
70-Monokuma.png
: So, I've decided to come up with a new way to
motivate
you!
5-Makoto2.png
: M-Motivate...!? Is it another set of videos or something...?
74-FlashT.png
76-FlashB.png
5-Makoto2.png
: Are you gonna show us some demented thing to try and drive us all to murder!?
69-Monokuma2.png
: Drive you to murder!? What a mean thing to say! Just awful!
78-Taka8.png
: I don't know what you've got planned, but we're not going to kill each other anymore!
79-Taka9.png
: No matter what you do, I swear to God we won't!
62-Monokuma4.png
: Hmm. That's very big talk. Do your best to back it up, okay? Now then, with your permission, let me begin! So this time it's...
81-Monokuma7.png
: ...
embarrassing memories and secrets
! As long as you're alive, it's a given that there's things you don't want other people to know about you!
82-Monokuma5.png
: So I did a little investigating of my own, and I dug up some of your
darkest secrets
!
84-Monokuma23.png
: And those embarrassing memories and secrets are all contained in the
envelopes
I have right here... I'm going to hand them out now, so take a second to take a peek!
As Monokuma spoke, he tossed the envelopes at our feet. I quickly snatched the envelope with my name written on it. I nervously pulled out what was written inside...and my entire body suddenly went rigid.
"Makoto wet the bed until he was in the 5th grade."
5-Makoto2.png
: What...!?
87-Hina12.png
: H-How...?
88-Taka12.png
: How'd you find out about this!?
Everyone started talking at once.
82-Monokuma5.png
: You have
24 hours
! If someone doesn't become blackened by then...all your deepest, darkest, most embarrassingest secrets will be
exposed to the world
! Maybe I'll roll by a crowded intersection in a van strapped with loudspeakers and spill the beans!
81-Monokuma7.png
: Kyaaah! Wouldn't that be sooo embarrassing!?
5-Makoto2.png
: ...So that's what you meant by "
motivate
"?
62-Monokuma4.png
: Yup, you got it! They're all pretty unpleasant, trust me. None of you want me to reveal that stuff, right?
5-Makoto2.png
: It's definitely something I'd rather people not know, but...
♪
Music cuts out.
♪
5-Makoto2.png
: We'd never kill over something like that!
69-Monokuma2.png
: Wh-What'd you say!?
91-Taka7.png
: He's right! Your plan is doomed to fail! No one's gonna murder someone for this kind of thing!
93-BeautifulDeath.png
94-Monokuma8.png
: O-Oh no... Is it because...for better or for worse, your memory is still a way to connect to the outside world? I have stuff I wouldn't want anyone to know no matter what, so I assumed you'd all be the same... Which is why I put so much effort into preparing this next motive!
68-Monokuma9.png
: Maaan! You're saying you really won't kill each other over this stuff? That just sucks! ...Well, what can ya do? Okay, then in 24 hours, I'll expose all you secrets just to make myself feel a little better!
94-Monokuma8.png
: So sad, so depressed! Farenotwell...! *leaves*
With an almost convincing look of depressed dejection on his face, Monokuma receded into the gym's depths.
38-Hina9.png
: I didn't know what to expect at first, but...maybe we dodged a bullet on this one.
96-Hina2.png
: I mean yeah, having those secrets revealed is gonna be totally embarrassing. But that's seriously not enough to give someone a reason to kill, right?
98-Taka15.png
: Good news, everyone! I have a brilliant idea!
91-Taka7.png
: Why don't we all just confess the
secrets
in those envelopes right here and now!?
99-Taka18.png
: If we do that, any and all motive for murder will vanish! That's pretty smart, right!?
91-Taka7.png
: Okay, so my embarrassing thing is...
49-Toko4.png
: I d-don't want to hear your stupid s-story!
101-Taka13.png
: What!?
102-Toko12.png
: Besides, I don't...I don't w-want to talk about it... I don't c-care what anyone says, I don't want to talk a-about mine!
104-Celeste5.png
: Neither do I. Not because it is unpleasant, but because it is impossible.
25-Hifumi5.png
: Well it's just human nature to wanna hear it when you say it's impossible! C'mon, it'll be good for ya!
105-Celeste15.png
: Absolutely not.
107-Hifumi15.png
: It's okay, just a little bit. C'mon c'mon c'mon...!
104-Celeste5.png
: As I said--
107-Hifumi15.png
: C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon!
109-Celeste10.png
: I said I don't wanna talk about it, you human bag of lard!
110-Hifumi11.png
: Kyaaah!
39-Byakuya.png
: I agree with them. There's no need to discuss it.
112-Taka11.png
: What do you think, Chihiro?
113-Chihiro8.png
: Um...s-sorry, I don't really want to talk about it right now.
115-Chihiro10.png
: But I also don't want to leave things the way they are. So maybe I can talk about it later... After I try my best...to become strong... Then I can tell everyone.
38-Hina9.png
: If you don't wanna talk, you don't have to. I'm not super-excited to talk about it, either...
117-Mondo15.png
: If everyone's that much against it... Even if my bro's the one that suggested it, I gotta say no.
30-Taka16.png
: W-Well, that's okay, then. Either way, if it's just a few secrets, I'm sure nobody's about to kill anybody over it.
I hope you're right... A secret so bad you'd kill someone to keep it... Nobody's got something like that, right?
52-Taka2.png
: Okay, I'll stop with all the secret talk. But...
78-Taka8.png
: Each of us has 24 hours to get ready! Having our secrets exposed isn't going to be fun, but it's not like we're gonna die cuz of it!
112-Taka11.png
: So, you know, um... Don't do anything hasty!
34-Hifumi2.png
: The way you keep repeating it kinda makes me worry even more...
120-Taka17.png
: Oh... Uh, okay, sorry. I know it's gonna be tough, but...
121-GoodNight.png
*Ding dong, bing bong*
124-MonokumaTV.png
: Mm, ahem, this is a school announcement. It is now 10 p.m. As such, it is officially
nighttime
. Soon the doors to the dining hall will be locked, and entry at that point is strictly prohibited. Okay then...sweet dreams, everyone! Good night, sleep tight, don't let the bed bugs bite...
126-Hiro4.png
: Nighttime already, huh? Okay, let's all call it a day.
127-Sakura.png
: Good idea. We need to prepare for tomorrow.
I was left with an anxiety I just couldn't shake, but we left things as they were, and left things as they lay. One by one, we headed back to our rooms.
130-AllStarApologies.png
Secrets or memories
you don't want anyone to know about... A way to connect to the outside world... Honestly, all that crap Monokuma was spouting didn't have any effect on me. There's no way anyone would kill over stuff like that. At least, that's what I thought. But maybe I was just being optimistic. Which is probably why, without too much of a struggle...
5-Makoto2.png
: Jeez, I'm more tired than usual. Super tired today...
...I fell asleep. But what I didn't know is that even then...a
tragedy
was taking place.
57-MrMonokumasLesson.png
134-MonokumaTheater.png
: Hey, do you have a second? I wanna confide in you... It's about the prevailing world attitude right now. The difference between passive and active. I mean... For example, it's the difference between like, "Oops! I killed him," and, "Yeah that's right. I killed him." Amazingly, there are tons of people who don't understand the difference. Can you believe it!? But there's a HUGE difference between "Oops!" and "That's right." You know what I'm saying, right? Anyone can kill someone in the heat of the moment. But surprisingly few can do it with calculated intent. To make that choice, then put it into action, it's way harder than just letting your emotions lead you. It's all about preparation. Resolve. So maybe you're wondering, what's the point I'm trying to make? Well, I'm not totally sure myself. Maybe you should try reading between the lines.

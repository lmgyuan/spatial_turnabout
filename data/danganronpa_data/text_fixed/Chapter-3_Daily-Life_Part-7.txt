: We have two more Free Time Events on the table today. It's worth noting that Kiyondo can actually be found in the halls during Free Time.
5-Kiyondo.png
: What!? You got somethin' to say to me!?
6-Kiyondo3.png
: Well I ain't got POOP to say to youuuUUUUU!!!
M-Maybe I should leave him alone...
3-Narration.png
: I didn't say he actually had an FTE though. No, sadly, we can't spend our Free Time with Taka while he's acting like this.
3-Narration.png
: However, at one point there were plans to let him have at least one FTE as Kiyondo. There is an unused FTE conversation still remaining in the game's files. It can't be accessed ingame, but the good people over at The Cutting Room Floor have extracted it along with many other unused things from this game. The following conversation was taken from this page specifically but
you really should not follow this link unless you've already seen the end of this game. It contains major spoilers for basically every aspect of the game.
I'm only putting it here to give credit where it's due.
YOU SHOULDN'T CLICK THIS LINK IF YOU'RE SEEING THE GAME FOR THE FIRST TIME (TCRF page on Danganronpa)

5-Kiyondo.png
: Let's begin, then... shall we?
9-Makoto.png
: Begin...what?
5-Kiyondo.png
: You race? You fight? You down with weapons?
9-Makoto.png
: U-Uhhh... Taka...I know you're pretty shaken up about Mondo and all that...
10-Kiyondo2.png
: Mondo... He...had a date with misfortune...
9-Makoto.png
: Huh?
10-Kiyondo2.png
: The moon...is disturbed...
6-Kiyondo3.png
: Hey! Whatchu standin' there for!? Keep fuckin' with my mojo and I'll fuck with your
face
!
5-Kiyondo.png
: You're a companion. But you're no bro...
After spouting a bunch of gibberish, Taka wandered off.
9-Makoto.png
: I hope he's all right...
No, no matter how you look at it, he is
not
all right...
8-Flashback.png
3-Narration.png
: This event would have given the player one Skill Point. If Kiyondo's character sounds different from what we've seen of it so far, don't forget that this isn't an official translation. Additionally, I went and changed the names from last names to first names to match the LP.
3-Narration.png
: Anyway, the real update begins here. Since we can't visit with Taka/Kiyondo right now, let's visit with someone else. Sakura's out in the third floor hallway.
13-Sakura4.png
: I don't like this atmosphere...
> Spend some time with Sakura
16-Sakura2.png
: Are you saying you're ready for another lesson? Very well. Prepare yourself, and come with me.
Sakura put me through a tough but rewarding training session. I can feel myself getting stronger. Sakura and I grew a little closer today.
> Yes definitely
God of War Charm:
A charm devised by the protective deity of martial arts, the Great and Gracious Kashima.
16-Sakura2.png
: I-I've been looking everywhere for this! How did you know!?
19-Sakura.png
: You're quite a mysterious man, Makoto...
Seeing Sakura so please with something I gave her makes me happy!
13-Sakura4.png
: My post-training break is the most relaxing time of my day. The sensation of your muscles cooling down after heating up during a workout is the only true reward. No matter how many times I experience it, I never get tired of it.
9-Makoto.png
: Do you exercise every morning, Sakura?
19-Sakura.png
: Unless there are errands that I absolutely can't get out of, yes, I always do my training. If I don't, I feel restless for the rest of the day.
9-Makoto.png
: But I'm amazed you can do it every single day. Doesn't it get tough?
21-Sakura6.png
: I can't say I've ever seen it as tough. It's all so that I can get stronger, after all... And I have to keep on getting stronger, because
my destiny is to fight
.
9-Makoto.png
: Your destiny...is to fight?
19-Sakura.png
: From the day I was born, I've been fighting. Heaven sent me to live as its champion.
That's one heck of a legend...
13-Sakura4.png
: My father was my master, and my every waking moment was spent with him learning to fight. As a child, I sparred with boxing champions and hit the mat with wrestling gold medalists. I was no match for them when I first began, of course... But before long, *they* were no match for *me*.
9-Makoto.png
: Y-You mean...you actually started beating people like that?
24-Sakura3.png
: I'd say my specialty is solid stand-up that transitions into grappling and a strong ground game. Essentially, it's a complete approach. Anything else just wouldn't make sense. You can only become the best by reaching the top of each discipline, then fusing them all together.
Stand-up fighting, grappling, and a strong ground game... That could only be...
> Mixed martial arts
9-Makoto.png
: You're basically a mixed martial arts fighter, right?
19-Sakura.png
: That's right. It's the most effective real-world fighting style, which is why I chose it. I don't want to just be the best in competitions. I want to be
the strongest human on Earth
.
9-Makoto.png
: I wouldn't bet against you, that's for sure. But aren't you already the best?
27-Sakura5.png
: No, not yet. There's still
someone I have to surpass
...
9-Makoto.png
: Really...?
13-Sakura4.png
: Until I can beat him, I'll never become the strongest...
9-Makoto.png
: You mean there's someone out there stronger than you?
21-Sakura6.png
: ... Maybe I'll tell you about it another time, if the opportunity presents itself. *leaves*
Sakura didn't make a sound as she left. I honestly can't believe there's someone out there stronger than Sakura... Even if they're real...can they really be human?
3-Narration.png
: This FTE gives us another Skill Point.
3-Narration.png
: Next, we're going to continue our Free Time chain with Byakuya. Characters can actually be in their bedrooms on occasion and you'll have to ring their doorbell to say hello.
I guess I should press the doorbell...
*Ding dong*
32-Byakuya.png
: I wondered who it was coming to talk to me. It turns out, it's the always useless, ever incompetent Makoto.
> Spend some time with Byakuya
35-Byakuya7.png
: Fine. I don't mind allowing you to indulge in my attention. I hope you appreciate this.
I spent some time with Byakuya... Byakuya and I grew a little closer today.
> Yes, definitely
Scarab Brooch:
The scarab was considered to be sacred by many ancient societies. It's better known today as...the dung beetle.
39-Byakuya12.png
: You...you bastard! How did you get your hands on this!? Even the collective force of the entire Togami Corporation wouldn't be enough to obtain this gem!
40-Byakuya4.png
: I...I'm going to hold on to this!
Seeing Byakuya so pleased with something I gave him makes me happy!
42-Byakuya2.png
: Listen, Makoto. I wanted to ask you something.
What could Byakuya want to talk to *me* about? I have a bad feeling about this...
9-Makoto.png
: Oh, umm... Sure, what's up?
42-Byakuya2.png
: You know...only a chosen few, perhaps 1% of us, are able to succeed in life.
32-Byakuya.png
: For the other 99%, their dreams never come true. Some never even have a dream in the first place... Spending every waking hour toiling to scrap together a meager living, just barely getting by...
35-Byakuya7.png
: I just don't understand. Is there any meaning to a life like that?
9-Makoto.png
: Why are you asking me...?
43-Byakuya3.png
: Because you're part of that 99%, of course. Why did you even feel the need to ask?
I knew he was gonna insult me somehow...
32-Byakuya.png
: Up until now, I've never been around anyone like that. So I'm interested... Tell me, how does it feel to live a life without hope, without potential or ambition or dreams?
44-Makoto2.png
: C-Come on! I don't have ambition, or dreams? I've never felt that way about myself! I mean sure, maybe I'll never be as rich as you or anything, but do you have to go around saying that to everything? Can you only be happy by being better than others?
43-Byakuya3.png
: Your complaints are as old and tired as a third-rate pop song from any generation... And yet, those are the words of the 99%. That is how you find comfort in your tiny, cold little world.
44-Makoto2.png
: S-Stop saying stuff like that!
35-Byakuya7.png
: Sorry, I can't not speak the truth. No matter how much you push and struggle, people like you will never be in a position to change the world. You could all disappear tomorrow, and nothing would change. Your existence is of no consequence.
44-Makoto2.png
: Whether that's true or not, it doesn't matter. Even if you live a totally normal, unimportant life, you can still find happiness in that. If I can live a life that I'm satisfied with, that's all that matters. If I spent all my time comparing my life to other people's, I'd never be happy. Sure, maybe you can do that. You were guaranteed success from the day you were born, so--
47-AllStarApologies.png
48-Byakuya5.png
: Hold it! From the day I was born? You have no idea...
50-Byakuya6.png
: You don't have a clue what you're talking about!
44-Makoto2.png
: What...?
48-Byakuya5.png
: Those who are "chosen" from birth have no concept of what that truly means.
I have gone to battle and emerged victorious
. *That* is why I am the chosen.
44-Makoto2.png
: Wh-What are you talking about...?
52-Byakuya15.png
: You're spoiled, all of you. Running away into a world of self-indulgence. Battle, competition, rivalry--you run away from it all. *That* is why the 99% walk the path that they do.
53-Byakuya14.png
: Good god, your absolute lack of understanding makes me want to weep. *leaves*
After showing a surprising amount of emotion, Byakuya quickly made his exit.
44-Makoto2.png
: What the heck got into him?
He was acting totally normal, up until... Until I said something about
being guaranteed success from the day he was born
...
44-Makoto2.png
: I wonder why that set him off...
3-Narration.png
: This unlocks the skill
Envious Influence
. It greatly increases the amount of hearts in our Influence Gauge during all aspects of the class trial. I don't anticipate needing to use it but it's a great skill to have on your first playthrough when you don't know all the correct answers.
I couldn't stop thinking about Byakuya while I went back to my room.
56-GoodNight.png
*Ding dong, bing bong*
59-MonokumaTV.png
: Mm, ahem, this is a school announcement. It is now 10 p.m. As such, it is officially
nighttime
. Soon the doors to the dining hall will be locked, and entry at that point is strictly prohibited. Okay then...sweet dreams, everyone! Good night, sleep tight, don't let the bed bugs bite...
Nighttime already... I guess I'll just go to bed for today.
61-MrMonokumasLesson.png
63-MonokumaTheater.png
: Happy New Day! I'm the kinda guy, I don't wanna celebrate a new year. I wanna celebrate the dawn of every new day! Because every new day deserves celebrating! So... Once again, happy New Day!

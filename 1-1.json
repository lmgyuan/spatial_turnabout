I'll make it look like HE did it!\n\nAugust 3, 9:47 AM\nDistrict Court\nDefendant Lobby No. 2\n\nPhoenix:\n(Boy am I nervous!)\n\nMia:\nWright!\n\nPhoenix:\nOh, h-hiya, Chief.\n\nMia:\nWhew, I'm glad I made it on time. Well, I have to say Phoenix, I'm impressed! Not everyone takes on a murder trial right off the bat like this. It says a lot about you... and your client as well.\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... thanks. Actually, it's because I owe him a favor.\n\nMia:\nA favor? You mean, you knew the defendant before this case?\n\nPhoenix:\nYes. Actually, I kind of owe my current job to him. He's one of the reasons I became an attorney.\n\nMia:\nWell, that's news to me!\n\nPhoenix:\nI want to help him out any way I can! I just... really want to help him, I owe him that much.\n\n???:\n(It's over! My life, everything, it's all over!)\n\nMia:\n... Isn't that your client screaming over there?\n\nPhoenix:\nYeah... that's him.\n\n???:\n(Death! Despair! Ohhhh! I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna die!!!)\n\nMia:\nIt sounds like he wants to die...\n\nPhoenix:\nUm, yeah. *sigh*\n\nButz:\nNick!!!\n\nPhoenix:\nHey. Hey there, Larry.\n\nButz:\nDude, I'm so guilty!! Tell them I'm guilty!!! Gimme the death sentence! I ain't afraid to die!\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat!? What's wrong, Larry?\n\nButz:\nOh, it's all over... I... I'm finished. Finished! I can't live in a world without her! I can't! Who... who took her away from me, Nick? Who did this!? Aww, Nick, ya gotta tell me! Who took my baby away!?\n\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say it was you...)\n\nPhoenix:\nMy name is Phoenix Wright. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: "When something smells, it's usually the Butz." In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!\n\nAugust 3, 10:00 AM\nDistrict Court\nCourtroom No. 2\n\nJudge:\nThe court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.\n\nPayne:\nThe prosecution is ready, Your Honor.\n\nPhoenix:\nThe, um, defense is ready, Your Honor.\n\nJudge:\nAhem. Mr. Wright? This is your first trial, is it not?\n\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor. I'm, um, a little nervous.\n\nJudge:\nYour conduct during this trial will decide the fate of your client. Murder is a serious charge. For your client's sake, I hope you can control your nerves.\n\nPhoenix:\nThank... thank you, Your Honor.\n\nJudge:\n... Mr. Wright, given the circumstances... I think we should have a test to ascertain your readiness.\n\nPhoenix:\nY-Your Honor. (Gulp... Hands shaking... Eyesight... fading...)\n\nJudge:\nThis test will consist of a few simple questions.

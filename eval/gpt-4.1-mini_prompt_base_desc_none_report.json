But if evidence shows there was no blackout at the time, then Testimony 6 contradicts the Blackout Record. However, the testimony suggests the phone wasn't working, not necessarily due to a blackout.\n\nGiven the above, the strongest contradiction is between:\n\nTestimony 9: \"The man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.\"\n\nAnd the Passport evidence (Evidence 3), which might prove the defendant was not at the scene.\n\nHence,\n"

If April's testimony about the victims' movement contradicts the location or presence of glass shards found at the scene, this could be a contradiction.\n\nSince there is no detailed explicit contradiction among testimonies themselves, the key contradiction is between testimony describing the victim's movement and the presence of glass shards that might indicate the victim did not run far or in that direction.\n\nThus, the evidence (Glass Shards) and testimony (3) contradict each other because the glass shards may not support the victim being hit as testified, or the victim's movement after being hit.\n"

Since Oldbag was supposedly at the main gate the entire time, it would be impossible for Powers to have walked by her at 2:00 PM toward the studio if the main gate is separate from the path to the studio, creating a potential contradiction between the location Oldbag claims to be at in Testimony 4 and the event she claims to witness in Testimony 6.\n\nEvidence-wise, the \"Cardkey\" (Evidence 4) or \"Powers's Letter\" (Evidence 1) might be used to validate or contradict the testimony about Powers' whereabouts, but focusing strictly on one evidence and one testimony pair that contradict each other, it would be the \"Cardkey\" (Evidence 4) if it provides access to the studio or location that Powers supposedly accessed, which could conflict with the testimony about the time and place.\n\nHowever, none of the evidences given directly contradict Oldbag's testimonies in the testimonies list above unless the Cardkey or another evidence places Powers elsewhere at 2:00 PM.\n\nGiven only the provided information, the strongest pair of contradiction is:\n\nTestimony 4: \"I was at the main gate from then until 5:00!\" (Oldbag)\nTestimony 6: \"Interesting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.\" (Oldbag)\n\nThese can be contradictory if walking by implies leaving the main gate, or being at different places.\n\nSince the task is to choose one evidence and one testimony pair, the best I can do is choose Evidence 4 \"Cardkey\" and Testimony 6, where the cardkey may be used to enter the studio around 2:00 PM, conflicting with the claim that Powers walked by Oldbag at the main gate at 2:00 PM.\n\nBut more solid contradiction is between the testimonies themselves.\n\nThus, focusing strictly on one evidence and one testimony pair, the contradiction is between Evidence 6 \"Powers'(?) Photo\" and Testimony 6.\n\nIf the photo shows Powers was somewhere else at 2:00 PM (based on timestamp on photo or content), that would contradict Oldbag's claim that Powers walked by at 2:00 PM.\n\nAssuming the photo is timestamped showing Powers elsewhere at 2:00 PM, the contradiction is between Evidence 5 (Powers'(?) Photo) and Testimony 6 (Oldbag seeing Powers at 2:00 PM).\n\nHence the answer:\n"

If the security camera footage shows that Sahwit was never near the door or did not peek through the window, this would contradict testimonies 1 and 2. However, since we only need to find one pair and there is no direct indication about the footage contradicting these testimonies in the provided data, let's look for a clearer pair.\n\nTestimonies 0 to 4 are all from Sahwit, describing his actions in sequence. There's no direct contradiction in these testimonies themselves.\n\nNow, consider the Pocket Chess Set (Evidence 3) and Dog Chess Piece (Evidence 11) along with Testimony 0 where Sahwit says he was in the workroom practicing his skills. If the chess pieces were found in Mr. Knight's room (Evidence 2: Mr. Knight's Body) or somewhere else, it might contradict testimony that Sahwit was practicing chess skills in the workroom. Yet, this is a stretch as the pocket chess set could be anywhere.\n\nLooking at Evidence 7 Door Sensor and Sahwit's testimony that he peeked through the small window on the door (Testimonies 1 and 2). If the Door Sensor shows that the door was never opened or used at that time, this could contradict Sahwit's claim of peeking through the door.\n\nSince a door sensor would detect opening or usage and Sahwit says he peeked through a small window (which doesn't require door opening), the door might not have opened but he could still have peeked.\n\nAlternatively, consider Evidence 20 Autopsy Report which might state the time of death. If it contradicts Sahwit's claim of when he found the body (Testimony 3: \"Then I saw him lying there... dead!\") by showing the victim died earlier or later than Sahwit claims, that would be a direct contradiction.\n\nGiven the data, the clearest contradiction is between \"Testimony 3: Then I saw him lying there... A man... not moving... dead!\" by Sahwit, and potentially the \"Autopsy Report\" (Evidence 20), which might indicate the time of death does not match Sahwit's claim of discovering the body.\n\nTherefore, these two are a likely contradicting pair.\n"

However, if Evidence 21 (Winter Wing Photo) is not taken by Kate or is somehow incompatible with the story (e.g., timestamp or style indicates photos were taken by someone else), this could be contradicting.\n\nBut there is no information about the origin of the Winter Wing Photo in the evidence.\n\nNo direct contradiction is found in the given data.\n\nAnother approach is to check for duplication or contradiction in evidence names: e.g., Evidence 7 and Evidence 28 are both \"Salt Lamp.\"\n\nThis might suggest a discrepancy, but it's not a testimony contradiction.\n\nSimilarly, Evidence 9 and Evidence 24 are both \"Luminous Cloth,\" and Evidence 10 and Evidence 35 are both \"Chocolates,\" and Evidence 15 and Evidence 26 both \"Ultimate Cookbook,\" Evidence 5 and Evidence 27 both \"Frame Finger Marks.\" These repeated evidences may represent the same or duplicate items, which doesn't necessarily conflict with testimonies.\n\nThus, I will narrow down to the following contradiction pair:\n\nTestimony 0: \"18 years after Monsieur Master was arrested, I was finally able to buy back this mansion.\" Person: Kate\n\nEvidence 17: Family Photo\n\nIf the Family Photo proves ownership or residence earlier or differently than testified (e.g., it shows that Kate was already living in the mansion before the 18 years, or shows ownership that conflicts with the claim of buying back), then it contradicts the testimony.\n\nGiven only one pair is required, I will select Evidence 17 and Testimony 0.\n"

On the other hand, if Evidence 14 (\"Semifinal Entries\") and Evidence 15 (\"Ultimate Cookbook\") suggest no cooperation in finals, it may support Testimony 0.\n\nSince the exact contents of the evidences aren't detailed, the best direct contradiction is between Testimony 0 and Testimony 2.\n\nGiven the instruction to provide one pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other, I must pick evidence that shows cooperation or lack thereof.\n\nEvidence 14 (\"Semifinal Entries\") may provide information on what happened in the finals, supporting or refuting claims about cooperation.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 2 (\"Crime Scene Notes\") could contradict Gusto's statements if it includes observations on teamwork.\n\nHowever, as no direct content from evidences is presented, I must choose the best match:\n\nEvidence 14 (\"Semifinal Entries\") and Testimony 4 (\"Aside from not cooperating with Sir Frost, the finals weren't much different from the semifinals.\") appear contradictory if the \"Semifinal Entries\" suggest cooperation.\n\nHence, the contradiction is between Evidence 14 and Testimony 4.\n\nBut the instruction asks specifically for one evidence and one testimony that contradict each other.\n\nSince I only have the testimonies here indicating cooperation or not, and no detailed descriptions of the evidences, I will pick:\n\nEvidence 14 (Semifinal Entries) indicating possibly cooperation, and Testimony 4 stating no cooperation in finals.\n"

But Testimony 3 says: \"The only exit from the storeroom is the hatch that leads to the viewing platform,\" implying access.\n\nIf the evidence or other testimony claims something else about the red raincoat's location or possession, that would contradict.\n\nGiven limited info, the best contradiction pair seems to be Evidence 22 Red Raincoat (which is an item that Ms. Crane is said to have won) and Testimony 4 (Ms. Crane went out to the viewing platform where she was attacked by Kay Faraday)\u2014the presence of the red raincoat on Ms. Crane being contested.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Testimony 1 and Evidence 22 do not contradict.\n\nI need to find one pair that clearly contradicts.\n\nAnother angle: Testimony 4 says Ms. Crane was attacked on the viewing platform by Kay Faraday.\n\nGravelle states all five testimonies.\n\nBut Evidence 8 is \"Kay's Recollections,\" which may contradict the testimonies given by Gravelle.\n\nIf Kay's recollections state that she did not attack Ms. Crane at the viewing platform, it would contradict Testimony 4.\n\nSince no direct quotes from Evidence 8 are given, I cannot confirm.\n\nAnother contradiction may be between Testimony 0: Ms. Crane went to the black market auction as a customer, and perhaps from other evidence suggesting Ms. Crane came to the auction as an infiltrator or seller.\n\nBut again, no direct conflict is shown.\n\nLooking further, Testimony 4 (Ms. Crane was attacked at the viewing platform by Kay Faraday), but if Evidence 10 (Keycard) and Evidence 12 (Keycard Record) indicates that Kay Faraday was not anywhere near the viewing platform at the time, then that would be a contradiction.\n\nIf the Keycard Record shows Kay Faraday somewhere else, it contradicts the testimony that Kay attacked Ms. Crane at the viewing platform.\n\nTherefore, if the Keycard Record contradicts Testimony 4, the pair is (Evidence 12, Testimony 4).\n\nGiven no other direct contradiction is apparent, this is the best candidate.\n"

The two testimonies therefore contradict each other regarding the timing and awareness of the burn mark.\n\nThe evidence involving the burn mark would likely connect to items like Evidence 3 (Letter) or 13 (Victim's Letter) or possibly Evidence 4 (Promise Notebook) if it contained references to the burn mark, but since no evidence directly discussing the burn mark is provided here, the contradiction lies strictly within the testimonies.\n\nSince only one pair involving evidence and testimony is requested, I note that none of the evidences directly contradict these testimonies about the burn mark except possibly the Prosecutor's Badge (Evidence 0) which establishes someone's role, but it doesn't mention the burn mark.\n\nGiven that, the only pair best fitting a direct contradiction involving an evidence and testimony is:\n\nTestimony 3: \"Maybe she was always wearing gloves in order to hide the burn mark, y'know.\"\nEvidence 3: Letter (presumably the letter could mention no such gloves or burn mark).\n\nHence, assuming the Letter (Evidence 3) contradicts the statement about always wearing gloves, pair Evidence 3 and Testimony 3 is chosen.\n"

If the silk hat was physically found or accounted for separately and it doesn't match Max's size or other attributes, this could contradict Moe's testimony about Max wearing it.\n\nMost importantly, Moe talks about a cloak fluttering in the wind, which obscured what's being carried. If there's evidence that definitively shows Max wasn't wearing such a cloak (e.g., the Ringmaster's Papers or Max's Promo Poster showing no cloak), Moe's claim about the cloak would be contradicted by evidence.\n\nBut the strongest contradiction is between Moe's repeated mention of the silk hat and presence of a \"Silk Hat\" evidence which may show it belonged to someone else or was found elsewhere.\n\nThus, the pair between Evidence 3 (Silk Hat) and Testimony 2 (\"His silk hat. That black cloak. They were all there!\") is a clear contradiction candidate.\n"

These testimonies are consistent with each other as both imply that the client may not have been met in person.\n\nTestimony 3 claims that one of the tasks was to find a bear figurine and give it to Adrian Andrews. This does not appear to contradict any known evidence directly.\n\nTestimony 4 mentions that de Killer thought the client was a man based on the name at the end of the letter. Since the letter or name is not specified in the evidences listed, we cannot confirm or deny this statement from the provided evidence.\n\nSince there is no direct contradiction found between the listed testimonies and evidence based on the provided information except for the possibility involving the bear figurine and the recipient, I will check for contradictions around this:\n\nIf the bear figurine (Evidence 25) is said to be given to Adrian Andrews (Character 8), and a testimony or evidence suggests otherwise, that would be a contradiction. However, no testimony or evidence indicates a different recipient or use for the bear figurine. \n\nThe only possible contradiction is between Testimony 3 (the bear figurine must be given to Adrian Andrews) and Testimony 4 which says de Killer thought the client was a man, but Adrian Andrews is a woman based on the context in the game series. This means that de Killer's assumption about the client's gender is incorrect as the request involved giving the bear to Adrian Andrews, a woman.\n\nThis could be viewed as a contradiction between the identity of the client expected by de Killer (a man) and the actual client (Adrian Andrews, a woman).\n\nThus, the contradiction is between the content of the letter (implying a female client - Adrian Andrews via the bear figurine) and the testimony that de Killer thought the client was a man.\n\nSince the letter is not specifically listed as evidence, but the \"Letter of Introduction\" (Evidence 19) is likely the letter de Killer refers to.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 19 (Letter of Introduction) and Testimony 4 (de Killer thought client was a man).\n"

Testimony 4 mentions that thirty minutes later, Atmey used an emergency phone to notify the police.

Evidence 9, the Security Camera Photo, typically contains a timestamp. If this photo shows that police were already notified or arrived well before 1:30 AM, or the timing contradicts the timeline given by Atmey, then the security camera photo and testimony 4 contradict each other.\n\nHowever, since the content or timestamps of evidence 9 is not provided, we have to infer based on the given data.\n\nWithin the testimonies provided, Atmey mentions the sequence consistently: arrival at 1:00 AM, being struck, knocked out, then notified police 30 minutes later. There is no direct contradiction in his own statements.\n\nNone of the other evidence details about time is given, only the names. But an evidence that would contradict a testimony about time should have timestamp or proof of a different time.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction most likely lies between Testimony 0 and Evidence 9 (Security Camera Photo), assuming the photo timestamp shows a different time of the incident or police arrival.\n\nHence, the pair is evidence 9 and testimony 0.\n"

If Ron is Mask\u2606DeMasque, there should be a clear link between him and the calling card. Yet, testimony 5 states that Ron says he snagged the broach on the door handle and it got torn off, implying that he has a broach (evidence 14: DeMasque's Broach) but this broach got torn off unintentionally, suggesting he may not be fully Mask\u2606DeMasque or that the broach is separate from his costume or calling card.\n\nMore directly contradictory is testimony 2, where Ron says he doesn't have an alibi for the night the urn was stolen, implying he had the opportunity. But the evidence 9 is a security camera photo that shows Ron at a different location that night, shown in testimony 4 where Ron points to himself in the photo. So testimony 2 (no alibi) contradicts evidence 9 (security camera photo) and testimony 4 (showing he was elsewhere).\n\nTherefore, the most direct contradiction pair is the security camera photo (evidence 9) versus testimony 2.\n"

None of the testimonies contradict Kudo's claim directly, but if we consider the \"Coffee Cup\" (Evidence 13), which presumably is the cup the drink was served in, if it tested negative for potassium cyanide or showed no signs of tampering, that would contradict Kudo's testimony about the serving girl's actions.\n\nSince a direct contradiction is requested, notice Testimony 6 says there \"wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front,\" suggesting no suspicious behavior from the serving girl, which slightly conflicts with the detailed accusation in Testimony 1 and 2.\n\nThe most direct contradiction seems to be between the presence of the white powder in the drink (Testimony 2) and the lack of any concrete evidence linking the serving girl or the drink to poisoning, possibly connected to the Coffee Cup or Potassium Cyanide evidence.\n\nSince only one pair is requested, the best fit is the contradiction between Kudo's claim of the serving girl putting white powder in the drink (Testimony 2) and the evidence that has no indication the Coffee Cup had any poison or tampering (Evidence 13).\n"

However, Violetta's other identity is Viola Cadaverini, who is connected to medical papers (Evidence 27), but there is no direct confirmation or supportive testimony from Violetta to corroborate Tigre\u2019s alibi. This suggests that Tigre's claim to rely on Violetta for his alibi might be questionable or not fully reliable.\n\nHowever, this is a weaker contradiction because it is based on an absence of testimony rather than direct opposing statements.\n\nA stronger contradiction is between Testimony 1 & 2 by Tigre and Evidence 27 (Viola's Medical Papers). Tigre claims to have been in his office all day and that he never saw the kid before. However, Violetta's medical papers may imply her involvement or presence related to the case, and \"the kid\" could refer to someone linked to the medical papers. If Viola is tending to anyone, Tigre's claim of never seeing the kid seems suspect.\n\nStill, as per the instruction, I must state only one pair that contradict.\n\nAnother contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Tigre's financial status implied by Evidence 8 (Jean's Loan Contract) or Evidence 25 (Repair Bill). Tigre states he has whales lined up to borrow cash from the Tender Lender every day, suggesting high cash flow, but evidence of debts like a repair bill or loans contrast his supposed wealth.\n\nBut this is indirect.\n\nTherefore, the most explicit contradictions are Testimony 1 & 2 where Tigre says he was in the office all day, and Testimony 4 where Tigre says you can ask Violetta to confirm his alibi. If Violetta's medical papers or other evidences say otherwise, it contradicts Tigre's statement.\n\nSince evidence 27 is Violetta's Medical Papers, which likely mention dates or details that contradict Tigre's claim of being in the office, I will choose these.\n"

We need a more direct contradiction.\n\nLooking at Testimony 0 and Testimony 1:\n\nTestimony 0: Tigre claims he never met Glen Elg.\nTestimony 1: Tigre says there was a guy named Glen Elg who wanted to borrow cash from him.\n\nThis suggests Tigre knew Glen Elg by name and wanted to interact with him, but claims never actually meeting him.\n\nEvidence 8 is \"Jean's Loan Contract,\" which may be related to Tigre lending money.\n\nMore directly, Evidence 10 is Glen's Autopsy Report, which confirms Glen is deceased.\n\nTestimony 2: Tigre claims he set up a meeting with Glen at the Tender Lender office.\n\nTestimony 3: Tigre waited around but Glen never showed.\n\nPutting it all together, Tigre denies meeting Glen. Evidence 8 might relate to a loan involving Glen and Tigre. If Jean's Loan Contract relates to Tigre lending to Glen, it would contradict Tigre's claim that he never met Glen because signing a loan contract would imply a meeting.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction exists between Evidence 8 (Jean's Loan Contract) and Testimony 0 (Tigre's claim that he never met Glen Elg).\n"

However, Testimony 6 indicates that because of what a waitress did, Tigre's business with the kid was over, implying a motive beyond just money for potentially killing the guy. This suggests that Tigre had reasons other than just the $100,000 to be involved in something drastic.\n\nNo direct evidence contradicts the testimonies about the $100,000 loan and his business dealings, but considering the list, Evidence 8, \"Jean's Loan Contract,\" might contain information about financial transactions or loans that could either support or contradict Tigre's claim about the loan and intentions. If the loan documents show something that contradicts Tigre's claim about having no other reason to kill or about the $100,000 loan, it would be the pair.\n\nLet's analyze: Tigre says he loaned Elg $100,000 (Testimony 0), and he tried to collect the money (Testimony 1-3). However, in Testimony 7, he claims he didn't have any other reason to kill the guy\u2014but in Testimony 5-6, he indirectly credits a waitress's actions for ending his business with the kid, suggesting some conflict. If the loan contract (Evidence 8) shows that the loan was not due or was paid, or otherwise contradicts Tigre's statements about the debt or motive, then that would be a contradiction.\n\nGiven this information, the pair \"Evidence 8 (Jean's Loan Contract)\" and \"Testimony 7 (Tigre's statement about no other reason to kill the guy)\" could be contradicting.\n"

For example, if the Crime Photo shows the victim stabbed without the two people fighting on the bridge, it would contradict Melissa's testimony.\n\nSince no visual description is provided here, let me focus on the given testimonies: Testimonies 4 and 6 by Melissa say the victim turned around and ran about 10 yards before being stabbed in the back. If the Victim's Note (Evidence 3) suggests she did not run or was attacked differently, this would be a contradiction.\n\nGiven the data, the most evident contradiction is between Evidence 3 (Victim's Note) and Melissa's account (Testimony 4 or 6).\n\nTo be specific:\n\n- Evidence 3 (Victim's Note) could state something opposed to Melissa's statement that the victim tried to run and got about 10 yards away before being stabbed.\n\nTherefore, the pair is Evidence 3 and Testimony 6.\n"

She can drive a snowmobile after all...\" (Testimony 5 by Bikini).\n\nNo contradiction there; both support the idea that the weapon was thrown and Iris drove the snowmobile.\n\nGiven the evidences and testimonies, the clearest contradiction is between the \"Note to Iris\" (Evidence 8) and the statement of Bikini seeing the snowmobile tracks (Testimony 2).\n\nIf the Note to Iris says something indicating Iris could not have left or driven the snowmobile, but Bikini testifies that Iris can drive the snowmobile and thus could have done it (Testimony 5), that might be a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, the contradiction is between the \"Weather Data\" (Evidence 7) and the \"Tracks Photo\" (Evidence 14). If the Weather Data shows heavy snowfall making tracks impossible or hard to find but the Tracks Photo clearly shows tracks, then that is a contradiction.\n\nBetween all these, the most straightforward contradiction is between the \"Note to Iris\" (Evidence 8) and Bikini's testimony #5 that \"Iris could have done that. She can drive a snowmobile after all...\"\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is:\n\nEvidence 8 contradicts Testimony 5.\n"

            "reasoning": "The testimonies from Iris claim that Mystic Elise struck Mystic Maya with her staff, then threw the staff away and pulled a dagger from inside her robe. However, Evidence 9 is the Victim's Staff. If the staff was thrown away and then used to strike, it would be contradictory if the staff evidence shows no such use or does not match the testimony's claim of it being the weapon used in the striking. More specifically, testimony 3 says: \"She threw her staff away and pulled a dagger from inside her robe!\" which implies the staff was discarded before the dagger was used, yet testimony 2 says \"While Mystic Maya was still stumbling, Mystic Elise moved in to deliver a fatal strike!\" which suggests the staff was used to deliver a fatal strike, conflicting with testimony 3.\n\nThus, testimony 2 and testimony 3 contradict each other, but the pair asked is between evidence and testimony, so we should find something in evidence contradicting a testimony.\n\nLooking at the Weather Data (Evidence 7) and the crime scene or timeline testimonies could be possible, but no clear contradiction is given here.\n\nAnother possible contradiction is Iris's testimony 0 \"I went to the Inner Temple that night and I saw it all happen in the garden.\" vs evidence like Hazakura Temple Map (Evidence 3) or Dusky Bridge Photo (Evidence 21). If the garden is in the Inner Temple, but the map shows differently, it may contradict.\n\nThe strongest direct factual contradiction is between Iris's multiple testimonies about Elise attacking Maya with her staff and then a dagger, while the Autopsy Report (Evidence 11) may indicate the cause of death being inconsistent with those weapons.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that Evidence 11 \"Elise's Autopsy Report\" contradicts Iris's testimony 1 \"I saw Mystic Elise strike Mystic Maya with her staff!\" because if Elise is the victim with an autopsy report stating cause of death inconsistent with being an attacker, that would contradict the assertion that Elise was attacking Maya.\n\nHowever, Iris's testimony explicitly states Elise attacked Maya, but the autopsy report of Elise suggests she is the victim. This is a contradiction between evidence 11 and testimony 1.\n"

Another angle: Testimony 1 says \"House chips come in two sizes: small and large.\" Evidence 6 might show chips not matching this.\n\nBetween Testimony 5 \"The moment loss was decided, defendant grabs bottle from table and...\" and Evidence 3 \"Deadly Bottle,\" there is no direct contradiction as these seem consistent.\n\nThus the only clear contradiction pair is between Testimony 3 (victim was winning) and Testimony 4 (defendant lost last hand).

If Mr. Smith has \"three aces\" and Mr. Wright has \"two aces,\" that would be five aces total. But a standard deck has only four aces (Testimony 1 confirms this).\n\nSo Testimony 3 implies an impossible situation with the card count, which conflicts with Testimony 1.

No direct contradiction.\n\nLet's look at Evidence 1 (Smith's Autopsy Report) and Testimony 5: \"He took bottle in his hand... Poor Mr. Smith!\"\n\nEvidence 3 is the Deadly Bottle, which is presumably the weapon.\n\nIf the autopsy report (Evidence 1) states that Mr. Smith had nothing in his hand at death, this contradicts Testimony 5.\n\nSince we don't have the details of the evidence contents, that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 2 and 7 are crime photos and could contradict Testimony 5.\n\nBecause the prompt demands only one pair of contradiction between evidence and testimony, the strongest contradiction emerges between Evidence 1 (Smith's Autopsy Report) and Testimony 5 regarding the bottle being held.\n\nIf the autopsy report says Mr. Smith's hand was empty or no bottle, then Olga's statement that \"He took bottle in his hand\" contradicts that.\n\nHence, the contradictory pair is Evidence 1 and Testimony 5.\n"

However, Testimony 1 says Smith walked in after Kristoph left, so if the trap was set with the card in the bottle, this contradicts the timeline of when Smith entered and the attack happened.\n\nThus, the contradiction lies mainly between the physical evidence of the Deadly Bottle (Evidence 3) and the timeline given by Phoenix in Testimony 1 and Testimony 3. Testimony 3 claims disposing of the card in the bottle during the game (before Smith walked in), but Evidence 3 (the Deadly Bottle) should reveal or not reveal this depending on the timeline and physical state.\n\nIn summary, Evidence 3 (Deadly Bottle) contradicts Testimony 1 (Smith's arrival five minutes after Kristoph left, implying the trap was set after Kristoph left, not during the game) or Testimony 3 (Phoenix disposing of the card in the bottle during the game). The clearer contradiction is between Evidence 3 and Testimony 3.\n"

Moreover, the testimony is from Stickler, who talks about the killer's actions with the pistol. The contradiction could be inferred if the bullet was found somewhere inconsistent with the testimony (e.g., if the positioning of the bullet or lack of pistol at the scene suggests the killer did not toss the pistol aside).\n\nSince the testimonies (0 to 4) all come from Stickler, and testimony 4 says the killer tossed the pistol aside and fled, but if the pistol is missing from the evidence or deemed not discarded, it would be a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between testimony 4 and evidence 19 (the bullet). The bullet suggests the shot was fired, but the testimony about tossing aside the pistol and fleeing might conflict with the scenario suggested by the presence of the bullet.\n\nHence, the contradictory pair is Evidence 19 (Bullet) and Testimony 4 (Tossing the pistol aside, he fled from the scene.)\n"

No, those can be compatible.\n\nTestimony 4 says: \"The yokai feathers and tracks weren't there before the Fox Chamber was opened.\"  \n\nEvidence 8, Golden Fur, presumably from the scene and present already.\n\nIf the tracks and feathers weren't there before, but evidence shows the fur was there before, that could be a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, L'Belle claims the Forbidden Chamber was locked until the mayor opened it (testimony 5), but evidence 6, \"Foyer Diagram,\" or evidence 7, \"Fox and Demon Statue,\" which had fallen to the floor (testimony 6), might indicate the chamber was tampered with.\n\nSince the testimonies focus a lot on L'Belle's statements, and considering the key conflict:\n\nTestimony 5: Forbidden Chamber was shut tight until the mayor opened it.  \nTestimony 0/1: L'Belle entered the Fox Chamber after the murder but only after certain events.\n\nIf evidence 17, Forbidden Chamber Key, is found in L'Belle's possession or somewhere indicating unauthorized access, it could contradict testimony 5.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction pair is:\n\nEvidence 17 (Forbidden Chamber Key) and Testimony 5 (\"The Forbidden Chamber was shut tight until the mayor opened it.\")\n\nExplanation: If the key was accessible to someone else or the chamber was accessible without the mayor's opening, testimony 5 would be false.\n"

This is not necessarily a contradiction.\n\nLooking at the evidence, Evidence 13 is Dr. Buff's Autopsy Report, which confirms Dr. Buff is dead. Evidence 12 is the Robbery Report, which presumably reports the crime.\n\nConsidering the above, Testimony 3 says that Atishon saw Mr. Are'bal running out of the front door, which Atishon says in Testimony 5 was around 10 at night and must've been him fleeing the scene of his crime.\n\nNow, if we consider Evidence 12 (Robbery Report) and Testimony 4 (Atishon had no idea Dr. Buff was dead so didn't call police), these can contradict because if a robbery occurred and Atishon saw a suspicious person running from the scene, it would be expected for him to report it regardless of knowledge about death.\n\nBut the direct contradiction is between Evidence 14: Armie's Statement and Testimony 3 and 5 given by Atishon.\n\nWithout more detailed content from the evidence and testimonies, the clearest contradiction is:\n\nTestimony 4: \"I had no idea Dr. Buff was dead.

However, Testimony 4 says, \"After that, the man lingered around the perimeter for some time.\" This suggests that the man, presumably Datz, remained near the premises after being ejected, which contradicts the idea of being removed from the premises.\n\nLooking at evidences, there is no direct evidence provided here that explicitly mentions the location of Datz after being ejected. But the testimonies 3 and 4 directly contradict each other regarding the presence of Datz near the premises.\n\nSince the instructions require pairing one evidence and one testimony that contradict, the closest match is to consider evidence relevant to Datz's ejection, which might be indirectly supported or contradicted by testimonies about his whereabouts.\n\nGiven the testimonies, the contradiction is between two testimonies rather than testimony and evidence. However, testimony 3 specifically states Datz was ejected (likely supported by Report or Witness), which could be contradicted by other evidence like security footage or report.\n\nExamining the evidences list, Evidence 12 is a Robbery Report, which might contain details about Datz's ejection or presence; Evidence 7 is Sarge's Drone, which likely would have visual confirmation; Evidence 14 is Armie's Statement, which might correspond to \"Sarge's\" statements.\n\nAssuming Sarge is Armie Buff (characters 9 and 5), Evidence 14 (Armie's Statement) likely is linked to Testimonies 0 to 5. Therefore, we might see a contradiction between Sarge's own testimonies.\n\nTherefore, the pair that involves a contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Testimony 4, but as the instruction asks for evidence and testimony that contradict, the closest evidence is Evidence 7 (Sarge's Drone) which would either support or refute Sarge's claim about Datz's ejection and lingering.\n\nIf Sarge states he saw Datz ejected (Testimony 3) and then lingering (Testimony 4), but the evidence (Sarge's Drone: Evidence 7) shows otherwise, this would be a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the contradictory pair is Evidence 7 (Sarge's Drone) and Testimony 4 (He lingered around the perimeter for some time).\n"

However, since the prompt specifically asks to find contradiction between an evidence and a testimony, we need to look carefully at the evidence for any that conflicts with the testimonies about the doctor being absorbed in a book or the presence at the scene.\n\nEvidence 3: Study Photo - might show the doctor at the study, perhaps absorbed in a book or not.\n\nHowever, also Evidence 13: Dr. Buff's Autopsy Report might reveal cause of death incompatible with the blunt force suitcase murder.\n\nBut as per the prompt to only pick one pair, the clearest contradiction is between the implication of the study photo (Evidence 3) and Testimony 2, or Testimony 3. For example, if the study photo shows no one present or the doctor collapsed, it contradicts Testimony 3 saying he was absorbed in a book.\n\nHence, the contradiction is between Evidence 3 (Study Photo) and Testimony 3.\n"

Let's check another pair.\n\nTestimonies 1 and 2 from Dhurke contradict each other:\n- Testimony 1: \"The next thing I knew, I was standing there with a bloody knife in my hand.\" (Implies Dhurke was present at the crime scene holding the knife)\n- Testimony 2: \"The possibility of a third party being there in the tomb is probably nonexistent.\" (Implies only Dhurke was there)\n\nThis suggests Dhurke is the killer, but Testimony 6: \"But I didn't kill him. At least, I don't think I did. It'd go against everything I believe in.\" and Testimony 7: \"Though, I guess there's no evidence that proves I didn't kill him either...\" show he is unsure or denying the killing despite the evidence.\n\nLooking at Evidence 29, Dhurke's Corpse Photo, seeing Dhurke dead conflicts with his own testimonies in present tense and being at the murder scene. If Dhurke is shown dead but also giving eyewitness testimonies about the event, that is contradictory.\n\nThus, there is a contradiction between Evidence 29 (Dhurke's Corpse Photo) and Dhurke's testimonies 0-7 where he describes the event as if alive and recounting the incident.\n\nSo one pair contradiction is:\n\nEvidence 29 (Dhurke's Corpse Photo) and Testimony 0 (Dhurke: \"I was struck by a sudden dizziness the moment I entered the tomb.\") \u2013 as Dhurke is talking after the murder but is shown dead.\n\nTherefore, this is a clear contradiction.\n"

The contradiction here is that if Nichody tore the page out to protect Sorin (suggesting cooperation with his wishes), but then went against Sorin's order, this implies conflicting actions regarding Sorin's wishes. But since no evidence directly contradicts this, this pair might not be the strongest contradiction.\n\nLooking further, Testimony 0 says Nichody rushed to the vista deck, but the crime had already been committed. Testimony 1 says he saw Miss Ellen and Gloomsbury collapsed, and Master Sorin writing in his notebook. Testimony 4 says the body was hidden in the spare Pegabull lantern in the hold. \n\nThe contradiction is between Testimony 0 and Testimony 1: If Nichody rushed to the vista deck and the crime had already been committed, how did he then see Ellen and Gloomsbury collapsed, and Sorin writing in his notebook? Because the first suggests he arrives after the event, and the second that he was present seeing the suspects right after the crime.\n\nLooking at the evidences, Evidence 5 is \"Broken Lantern\" and Evidence 18 is \"Sorin's Notebook\".\n\nIf Nichody in Testimony 3 says he tore the page out of Sorin's notebook, but the evidence (Sorin's Notebook) should show that page missing or not.\n\nAssuming that the torn page is the contradiction - the notebook has the page missing but Nichody claims to have torn the page to protect Sorin\n\nLet's find a better contradiction pair.\n\nTestimony 4: Nichody says \"In the hold, I hid the still-warm body in the spare Pegabull lantern.\"\n\nEvidence 5: Broken Lantern.\n\nIf the lantern was broken and still held a warm body, this might be suspect.\n\nPerhaps the contradiction is the hiding place.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 2 and 3 conflict: Testimony 2 quotes Sorin asking Nichody to take the blame, but Testimony 3 says Nichody went against his order.\n\nBut this is not a contradiction between testimony and evidence.\n\nLooking between Testimony 0 and Evidence 6: Photo of Victim.\n\nIf the victim is not the one found in the lantern as per testimony 4, perhaps conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 16 is \"Lift Bloodstain\" which may indicate the crime took place in the lift, contradicting Testimony 0 which says the crime was on the vista deck.\n\nTestimony 0 says \"I rushed to the vista deck, but the crime had already been committed.\"\n\nEvidence 16: Lift Bloodstain: presence of blood in the lift suggests the crime happened there, not the vista deck.\n\nTherefore, they contradict each other.\n\nHence,\n"

This might conflict with the evidence on who actually had the gun or was the shooter. However, these are two pieces of evidence and one testimony, and the prompt asks for one evidence and one testimony.\n\nAnother possible contradiction is the testimonies by Nash (Testimony 6) stating \"We couldn't 'ave shot the pawnbroker, see! We never even 'ad a chance, did we?\" vs the evidence of guns (Evidence 12: Windibank's Gun, Evidence 13: Skulkin Brothers' Gun) and the crime scene evidence (Evidence 10, 11). If the evidence shows that the Skulkin brothers' gun was used in the shooting, this contradicts Nash's statement he didn't have a chance and could not have shot.\n\nSpecifically, Testimony 1 and 2 by Ringo discuss hearing the gunshot and hearing someone yell \"Gimme that gun!\" which may conflict with Nash's statements (Testimonies 0,3,4,6) about the shooter or the scenario. However, more clearly, Testimony 6 states they could not have shot the pawnbroker, while the presence of the Skulkin brothers' gun (Evidence 13) and crime scene evidence likely points otherwise.\n\nHence, the contradiction pair is:\n\nEvidence 13: Skulkin Brothers' Gun\n\nTestimony 6: \"We couldn't 'ave shot the pawnbroker, see!

This does not directly contradict evidence but rather explains her limited knowledge.\n\nLooking at the evidences, Evidence 14 is \"Miss Green's Card,\" which presumably has her address or contact information. Testimony 5 says that a note was delivered to Green at her address and that it is unrelated to the \"odd man next to me here.\" This seems to show she received a note at the address on the card, which matches.\n\nTestimony 1 says the stabbing occurred just outside the house where the men in this case have their lodgings, but Testimony 3 says this was the first time Green was in the area. If the house is where the men live, and the stabbing was just outside, but Green had never been in the area before, this may be contradictory.\n\nEvidence 2 is \"Nearby Street Map,\" which presumably shows locations and their proximities.\n\nPutting it together:\n\n- Testimony 1 (Green): The stabbing happened just outside the house where the men in this case live.\n\n- Testimony 3 (Green): It was the first time I had been in the area.\n\nIf the stabbing happened just outside the men's lodging, but Green had never been to the area before, this is contradictory.\n\nTherefore, the contradictory pair is:\n\nEvidence 2 (Nearby Street Map) indicating the location in question, and Testimony 3 (Green) stating it was the first time she had been in the area.\n\nBut the instruction is to name one evidence and one testimony that contradict each other.\n\nAlternatively, another more direct contradiction is between Testimony 0 and Testimony 4, both from Green.\n\nTestimony 0 says she was stabbed in the back six days ago at about 5 p.m. while walking along in the snow\u2014so she was outside.\n\nTestimony 4 says she was admitted straight to hospital and knew nothing about all this business.\n\nIt's not a direct contradiction if she was stabbed and admitted to the hospital.\n\nIs there an evidence that contradicts any testimony?\n\nEvidence 5: Bar of Soap \u2013 likely irrelevant.\n\nEvidence 12: Bottle of Poison might relate to a poisoning.\n\nEvidence 7: Victim's Medical Report maybe relates to the stabbing?\n\nIf the medical report says the stabbing occurred at a different time or different circumstances than described in Testimony 0, then we have a contradiction.\n\nBut since the text of the medical report is not given, this is unknown.\n\nGiven all of this, the best fitting contradiction is between Testimony 1 and 3 from Green, and Evidence 2.\n\nBecause Testimony 1 says stabbing happened just outside men's lodgings.\n\nTestimony 3 says it was first time she'd been in area (implying she didn't know about nearby lodgings).\n\nEvidence 2 is a street map that could confirm the proximity and contradict her \"first time in area\" statement.\n\nTherefore,\n"

However, Testimony 3 has Green saying, \"I don't know what you mean. You think I snuck into this man's room, do you? Why would I?\" This reflects defensiveness about being accused of sneaking into the man's room but does not necessarily deny knowledge about the envelope.\n\nBetween these testimonies and the evidence, there is no direct contradiction except Green\u2019s denial of knowledge about the torn envelope against the existence of the evidence (torn-off end of envelope). The denials about sneaking into the room are slightly different points.\n\nHowever, looking at Testimony 0, 1, and 2 by Shamspeare about a vanished note: He remembers receiving a note a week ago, stayed a long hour at the Slug and Salad matching the note's instructions but no one came, and later saw the note had vanished. This is consistent internally but does not contradict evidence.\n\nTherefore, the direct contradiction lies between Green\u2019s denial of the torn-off piece of the envelope (Testimony 4) and the fact of the torn-off envelope piece as evidence (Evidence 4).\n"

Then I left as soon as the corpse was interred.\"\n\nThese two messages contradict each other since testimony 2 says \"just before the interment\" meaning while the corpse was still above ground and ready to be buried, and testimony 6 says \"then I left as soon as the corpse was interred,\" implying the work was finished after interment. But these two are consistent; so, perhaps there's another.\n\nLook at Testimony 4: \"It took me a very long time because it was before the onset of rigor mortis.\"  \nTestimony 3: \"I hid myself until he gave me a signal. ...I was there for a very long time that night.\"\n\nThese don't necessarily contradict.\n\nOne significant contradiction could be found between Evidence 6 (Autopsy Report) and Testimony 4 (It took me a very long time because it was before the onset of rigor mortis). If the autopsy report states rigor mortis had already set in, Tusspells' testimony that she worked before rigor mortis contradicts it.\n\nTherefore, the pair is:\n\n- Evidence 6 (Autopsy Report)  \n- Testimony 4 (It took me a very long time because it was before the onset of rigor mortis).\n"

De Rossi says they took the man's identification (passport) from him and locked him up. De Rousseau says they kept him at the hideout without harm. \n\nIf we consider Testimony 2 (\"We took the man's identification from him and shut-a him in the room next to ours!\") contradicting with Evidence 21 \"Passport\" because if the passport was presented as evidence indicating the man retained possession, then De Rossi's claim of taking it would be false. Thus, if the passport was found undisturbed and with the victim or suspect, it would contradict De Rossi's assertion.\n\nTherefore, the pair that contradict each other would be Evidence 21 and Testimony 2.\n"

However, no direct contradictory evidence between testimonies and evidence is immediately available that deals with the location of the body.\n\nGiven only the testimonies, the main contradiction lies between Testimony 4 and Testimony 5.

This implies some level of active planning and involvement. \n\nTestimony 2, from Vigil, says that although Vigil was responsible for Asogi until his execution, Vigil knew nothing of any plot. This directly contradicts Caidin's account of a planned action involving Vigil.\n\nIf we look for an evidence to compare, the \"Telegram from Japan\" (Evidence 27) or \"Letter of Introduction\" (Evidence 3) might suggest communication or planning related to the convict, possibly supporting or contradicting testimonies.\n\nHowever, the explicit contradiction is between the testimonies of Caidin (Testimony 1) and Vigil (Testimony 2) regarding knowledge and involvement in a plot.\n\nSince the prompt requests one pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other, I need to find an evidence that contradicts a testimony.\n\nLooking at Testimony 0, Caidin says: \"It was the day that Japanese jock was found guilty. The directive came from the Prosecutor's Office.\"\n\nNow, if Evidence 25, \"Evacuation Drill Itinerary\", or Evidence 27, \"Telegram from Japan\", contains information about directives or instructions, or if Evidence 19 \"The Asogi Papers\" involves directives or legal documents.\n\nIf, for example, \"Red-Headed League Article\" (Evidence 1) or \"Dismissal Notice\" (Evidence 4) indicates some conflicting information about orders coming from the Prosecutor\u2019s office or the timing of events, that could contradict Caidin\u2019s testimony.\n\nGiven the provided data, the best pair of contradicting statements with an evidence would be:\n\nEvidence 2 \"Photograph of Mr Vigil\" shows Vigil\u2019s involvement or presence during events indicating knowledge, which contradicts Vigil's own testimony (Testimony 2) of knowing \"nothing of any plot.\"\n\nSo, Evidence 2 (Photograph of Mr Vigil) contradicts Testimony 2 (Vigil's claim of no knowledge of the plot).\n"

However, Testimony 2 claims, \"After that, I was in my room the entire time,\" which contradicts the idea that he was present with the girl to open the door, or at least challenges the timeline being presented. Additionally, if there is evidence such as a \"Master Key\" (Evidence 5) or \"Mr. Portsman's Office\" (Evidence 6), this might be used to either confirm or refute the claim made in Testimony 1. If Evidence 6 (Mr. Portsman's Office) includes logs or signs of when the door was opened, it could contradict Testimony 2 if the timestamps or conditions don't align. Without more detailed description of the evidence contents, the strongest contradiction is within the testimonies themselves regarding Portsman's whereabouts and actions. Since the prompt asks for a contradiction between a testimony and an evidence, and given there is a \"Master Key\" (Evidence 5) which would provide access to the office, if the \"Master Key\" is found in a place inconsistent with Portsman's claim, this could contradict either Testimony 1 or 2. The simpler, clearer contradiction here is between Testimony 1 and Testimony 2, but because that is two testimonies, not evidence and testimony, we choose the evidence that would contradict one of these testimonies. For instance, if the \"Mr. Portsman's Office\" evidence shows that the door was not opened by the girl, contradicting Testimony 1.

However, Testimony 2 says Officer Meekins' story about the shop on wheels being stolen is a lie.\n\nOfficer Meekins is Character 7, and Lang is Character 4.\n\nIf we look at Evidence 5: Stolen Costumes, this likely refers to some theft at the crime scene.

Badd's Testimony  \nThese are testimonies, not evidence.\n\nEvidence 17: Surveillance Video might show what really happened.\n\nSince no direct evidence is paired here that contradicts directly with the testimonies above except the possibility that Evidence 2 or 10 contains different statements, the best direct contradiction is the pair of Testimony 0 (no motive for killing both) and Testimony 3 (that the killing was intentional and set up to look like a mutual killing).\n\nGiven the context, Evidence 2 is Det. Gumshoe's Testimony: assuming this testimony supports the idea that the killings were intentional, it would contradict Testimony 0, which says nobody had a motive.\n\nTherefore, the pair of contradiction would be:\n\nEvidence 2 (Detective Gumshoe's Testimony) and Testimony 0 (Yew's statement about no motive).\n"

If the knife is murder weapon, it conflicts.\n\nTestimony 5: \"Plus, I found the murder weapon's owner, the suspect, Larry Butz in here, too.\"\n\nSo Larry Butz is the suspect according to Testimony 5. If Larry had ownership or connection only to Knife (Evidence 5), but the Samurai Sword is the murder weapon, then evidence and testimony about ownership contradict.\n\nThe best pair that contradict is:\n\n- Testimony 3: Suspects the Samurai Sword used to beat victim to death.  \n- Evidence 5: Knife exists, implying another murder weapon.\n\nThe contradiction is about the murder weapon used: sword or knife.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 5 (Knife) implying a different weapon, and Testimony 3 (the sword being used).\n"

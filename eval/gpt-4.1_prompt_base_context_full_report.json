This means that unless Sahwit had prior knowledge of the statue's clock function, he should not have been able to identify it as a table clock just from glancing at it while discovering the body.

I did!\"\n\nNow, let's look at the evidence:\n- Evidence 2: Glass Shards \u2013 The broken remains of a glass light stand. Broken beyond all recognition.\n- This refers to a glass light stand that was broken at the scene of the crime.\n\nIf April claimed to see Maya hit Mia with \"that weapon\" (which refers contextually to the murder weapon\u2014supposedly \"The Thinker\"), but the autopsy report (Evidence 5) says the death was instantaneous, and April's testimony suggests a struggle, that's one contradiction. However, a more concrete contradiction would be if April claims to have \"seen\" the murder from the hotel, but the floor plans (Evidence 8, not included in the testimonies here) or glass shards (Evidence 2) indicate something that would make that impossible.\n\nBut more precisely, Evidence 2, \"Glass Shards,\" contradicts Testimony 3's description\u2014April says she saw Maya hit Mia, but the presence of broken glass light stand implies that the actual sequence might have involved something else\u2014perhaps Mia tried to defend herself, knocking over the glass stand, which April conveniently leaves out. This casts doubt on the testimony's reliability.\n\nHowever, an even sharper contradiction is that April claims \"I saw her hit with that weapon\" (the statue clock, \"The Thinker\"), but, as records say, the killer searched for evidence and removed the clockwork mechanism. So if the clock (Evidence 1) is not functional (the clockwork was removed), and this fact is omitted or contradicted in the testimony, that could also be a contradiction.\n\nBut sticking strictly to the instructions and only outputting one pair: the contradiction is more obvious between Testimony 3 (\"And she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did!\") and Evidence 2 (Glass Shards), since the glass shards suggest another struggle or event that April doesn't mention, which throws doubt on the veracity of her claim of having seen the attack as she described.\n"

This suggests the Conductor/victim was on the floor below with the auction participants, not \"waiting in the storeroom where the goods were delivered.\" The culprit could not have been solely \"waiting in the storeroom\" for the Conductor because the Conductor was present and active during the auction, and the murder occurred mid-auction, not in a gap after the auction ended or during some private delivery.

Cause of death: Stab wounds to chest. Head injury sustained post mortem. Death occurred as a result of a heavy blow to the head with a circular object. Chest wounds inflicted post-mortem.\"\n\nThis is very significant! The autopsy states the *chest wounds* were inflicted after death; the *cause of death* was the heavy blow to the head, NOT the heart stab wounds, which were done post-mortem.\n\nGravelle\u2019s statement is that no one could survive a stab to the heart: she was stabbed in the heart, therefore she couldn't walk around after. However, the autopsy proves that's wrong: the chest stabbing happened after death, so the victim *was alive* and walking shortly after the attack, until she received the fatal head blow.\n\nTherefore, Testimony 3 (\"Is there any person who could survive such an injury?\") contradicts Evidence 11 (the Autopsy Report).\n"

However, the presence of yellow flecks (lion lily pollen from the bouquet) on the victim's chest, and NOT traceable evidence of a gun aimed at Simeon per se, reveal that this shooting incident either didn't happen as described or there was more going on\u2014perhaps it was part of Simeon's cover-up.

However, a bullet hole that low (8 inches above ground in the screen) suggests the shooter would have needed to be in an unusual position (very low, kneeling, or prone), and not standing up and firing straight ahead as expected if two adults were fighting standing up. This casts strong doubt on the scenario described in the testimony, as the trajectory doesn't match a close-quarters upright shooting.

This means the victim was positioned in a very specific place, and the box was heavy enough (20 lbs) to anchor someone in a predictable spot. Further, the presence of the box and the footprints demonstrate the location of the Ringmaster's head could be predicted without Acro needing to look out of the window and exert force on his lower body. If Acro used the box as an anchor or marker and timed the drop when the Ringmaster bent over the box (as specified in the photo), he wouldn't have needed to physically see or aim with his lower body\u2014overruling his testimony that such force or action was impossible. The photo contradicts Acro's claim that he couldn't have exerted the necessary force or aimed precisely.\n"

            "reasoning": "Let's examine the evidence and testimony for contradictions.\n\nTestimony 3: \"He had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know.\"\n(Oldbag is saying Engarde was going to the post-ceremony show right after the crime, implying he wouldn't have changed out of his Nickel Samurai costume after killing Corrida.)\n\nRelevant evidence: The Nickel Samurai (Evidence 2), which is a photo describing the Nickel Samurai costume.\n\nBut more importantly, the contradiction presented in the trial is this:\n\nOldbag initially claims she saw Engarde wearing his \"flashy racing jacket,\" but the button from the Jammin' Ninja costume was found in the \"hakama\" of the Nickel Samurai costume (see Evidence 16, Jammin' Ninja's Button, and testimony about the costume).\n\nOldbag then changes her story to say it was \"the Nickel Samurai\" (the person in the costume) she saw leaving Juan's room, suggesting the killer was wearing the full Nickel Samurai suit at the time.\n\nBut if he was in full costume (the Nickel Samurai suit), then after the stabbing, why are there no blood stains reported on the Nickel Samurai costume, even though the murder was stabbing someone in the chest? Also, the wine glass at the scene is completely clean, apart from Andrews' fingerprints (see Evidence 8), implying perhaps the killer was wearing gloves or costume gloves, but Oldbag's testimony says the killer wasn't holding anything in either hand (she says both hands were empty).\n\nHowever, the testimony that most obviously contradicts the facts is Testimony 3: \"He had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know.\" Oldbag uses this to justify why Engarde was in costume. But the Press Conference Ticket (Evidence 3) shows that there was a scheduled press conference, not an immediate show, and Mr. Engarde himself claimed he wasn't even told about a press conference\u2014that it was arranged by his manager and the show was canceled.\n\nBut the most direct contradiction, as highlighted within the trial, is:\n\nOldbag claims Engarde was wearing his \"flashy racing jacket\" when leaving Corrida's room. But the evidence (Jammin' Ninja's Button, Evidence 16) was found in the \"hakama\" (part of the Nickel Samurai costume), indicating the person was in costume, not in the flashy jacket. Her stories don't line up.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between:\nTestimony: \"He was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show.\" (an extension from her previous statements about what Engarde was wearing)\nand\nEvidence: Jammin' Ninja's Button (Evidence 16), which was found in the costume.\n\nFrom your provided list, let's map to the correct numbers:\n\nThe statement \"He was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show.\" is a sub-testimony under the segment where Oldbag was pressed to clarify clothing. Given only the main testimony numbering here, that would be related to Testimony 3: \"He had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know.\" (i.e., about being in costume versus in his jacket).\n\nEvidence 16 is the button found in Engarde's \"hakama,\" which is a key proof.\n\nTherefore, the pair is:\nEvidence: Jammin' Ninja's Button (Evidence 16)\nTestimony: He had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know. (Testimony 3)\n\nFinal answer:"

This discrepancy casts doubt on her testimony about how the case got wet.\n"

The real contradiction, however, is best demonstrated by the physical evidence: the Guitar Case (Evidence 7). According to the investigation, the guitar case only bears the fingerprints of the victim (Juan Corrida)\u2014if Matt Engarde had struggled with Juan as claimed, his fingerprints (or Andrews' if she opened it) should also be on it. Additionally, the Wine Glass (Evidence 8) contains only Andrews' fingerprints, not Engarde's, but she claims she was not present for the actual crime.\n\nThe most direct contradiction is between Testimony 5 (\"That button was torn off of Juan during his fight with Matt\") and Evidence 14, Juan's Autopsy Report, which states he was strangled with a scarf and then stabbed, not in a simple brawl where a button would be torn off during a physical fight between the two.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is:\nTestimony 5: \"That button was torn off of Juan during his fight with Matt.\"\nEvidence 14: Juan's Autopsy Report - cause of death was strangulation with a scarf, then stabbing, not a brawl resulting in a button being ripped off.\n"

If De Killer had been bringing something into the room as a bellboy (such as room service on a tray, perhaps with a wine glass and juice), and left empty-handed, it would be odd for there to be a wine glass with someone else's fingerprints in the room. The details, combined with testimony and the evidence, suggest a contradiction: if De Killer brought in room service and left empty-handed, the wine glass should bear his prints or be gone with him. Furthermore, the nature of the wine glass and its presence ties into key aspects of the case\u2014especially with Powers' testimony about the bellboy being empty-handed (no tray, glass, etc.), while the wine glass remains in the room as evidence.\n"

But in Testimony 3, she says she didn't see the actual push.\n\nTherefore, her claim in Testimony 3 is inconsistent with what is visible at the scene (Evidence 2) and Phoenix's testimony (Evidence 6).\n\nBut since you asked for evidence/testimony pair, and mentioning that only one is to be chosen,\n\nThe classic contradiction drawn in this scene is:\nTestimony 3: \"Um, actually, I didn't see the moment he pushed Dougie.\"\nversus\nEvidence 2: Crime Photo 1 (shows umbrella not under victim after the push)\nThis contradicts her claim that nothing unusual happened and she saw the whole time, when clearly there was movement or something else she didn't witness or ignored.\n\nTherefore:\n"

Furthermore, Crime Photo 1 shows the umbrella (which the victim supposedly landed on when first pushed\u2014supported by Phoenix's testimony and the fact that the handle is bent from the fall) has not moved from its original location, indicating that Doug did not run away and get pushed a second time.

The description in the evidence reveals the sword was not bent before the crime, was in the hand of Ami Fey's statue, and DeMasque knocked Atmey out with a blow to the back of the head, implying Atmey was attacked from behind unexpectedly. However, the way the sword is bent indicates more than just a single, surprise blow, and it suggests Atmey's claim of being knocked out before even fighting back is false or misleading.\n"

Atmey claims his \"fighting style\" is to always put his back to the wall, so no one can get behind him and strike him from the back. However, the injury he describes (\"the blow landed upon my third eye\") would require the attacker to strike him in the forehead, meaning the blow would have to come from in front.\n\nBut the Shichishito is a heavy, unwieldy object, and the statue was next to the door. If Atmey really put his back to the wall to defend himself, no one could have attacked him from the front with that sword, since the sword was by the door (behind him, if he faced the room). The evidence (how the sword was found and where Atmey was struck) suggests he was hit from *behind*\u2014not the forehead\u2014contradicting his testimony.\n"

Covered in the victim and Maggey's fingerprints. Facing the cup, one can see a lip stain on the front, and a floral looking handle to the right.\n\nIf the victim picked up the cup with his left hand, the handle would be on the other side, which would not match the position of the cup and fingerprints, according to the crime photo (Evidence 12, but that's not what's in question here directly).\n\nBut, more decisively, if the cup's handle (floral-looking) was to the right of the lip stain, that means he picked it up with his right hand, not left! Kudo says \"free hand\" is left, but the cup position proves he used the right hand.\n\nTherefore, Kudo's memory is mistaken about which hand was holding the newspaper, or the cup, so his testimony is contradicted by the crime evidence (Coffee Cup).\n"

Found lying in Tender Lender.\") links the loan office to the crime scene. Considering also that the MC Bomber virus CD was found at Tender Lender instead of Tres Bien (see Evidence 23), this implies Tiger was involved in the movement of items between the locations, contradicting his claim of never leaving the office and always doing normal business. \n\nBut looking for a sharper contradiction in the provided material, let's also consider Evidence 23 (MC Bomber). The testimony claims Tiger runs a normal loan office, but the MC Bomber disc, a multi-million-dollar computer virus, was found in his office, betraying that his business involves black market crime, not regular lending.\n\nSpecifically, though, among the testimonies, Testimony 2 (\"The day youse talkin' about, I was in de office, too. I never saw that kid before.\") is sharply contradicted by Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar), which states, \"On Dec. 3rd, the day of the incident, there is a note saying, 'Meet with The Tiger.'\" This directly undermines Tigre's claim that he never saw Glen Elg that day.\n\nTherefore, the most direct contradiction is:\n\nEvidence 20 (Glen's Calendar) and Testimony 2 (\"The day youse talkin' about, I was in de office, too. I never saw that kid before.\").\n"

This means Iris did NOT have her hood after 10 PM. Bikini specifically says in Testimony 3 that now that she thinks about it, \"Iris didn't have her hood on\" during the murder. However, earlier in her testimony, she repeatedly says she saw Iris as she normally appeared and only later recalls the missing hood after being pressed. The contradiction actually is rooted in that, with the hood (Evidence 6) showing Iris did not have it after 10 PM, supporting this revised memory and contradicting her initial certainty that Iris was dressed as usual at dinner, including the hood. If you want a contradiction, the moment it becomes significant is when she flips her memory after presentation of the hood as evidence.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 6 (Iris's Hood) and Testimony 3 (Bikini noticing the hood missing).\n"

However, in his testimony, he's later forced to admit that when he arrived, the fire was already out, which doesn't line up with his claim that he went \"right away.\" The Weather Data shows the fire lasted for about 30 minutes after lightning struck at 10:45.

However, Crime Photo 2 shows the victim with a grave head wound that was concealed by his hat in the initial crime scene photo. If the murder happened immediately after the last hand and involved such a violent action, it would be highly unlikely that the victim's hat would remain on his head and neatly conceal evidence of the fatal blow, as it appears in the original crime scene photo.

Estimated time of death: 9:00-9:30 PM.\" The in-court discussion supports this, saying it \"takes at least 15 minutes from the time of ingestion for adverse effects to show.\"\n\nNow, look at Brushel's testimony: Testimony 6 states, \"He had one sip, if that. The next moment, he was on the floor!\" This implies that the poison acted *immediately* after Misham sipped his coffee \u2013 he took \"one sip, if that\", then \"the next moment, he was on the floor.\"\n\nThis is a contradiction: according to medical evidence, atroquinine does not act instantly, but only after a significant delay. Therefore, the immediate collapse cannot have been due to ingesting atroquinine in the coffee, and the testimony here is in direct conflict with the autopsy report's information about the poison's nature.\n"

Only Jinxie and the alderman knew what the statue originally represented, and the cup portion symbolizing goodwill was missing/broken off. If L'Belle was supposedly only present after the crime, he should not have known the statue's true, original symbolism.

However, Evidence 20 (Azuki Kozo Figure) directly contradicts the gravity of L'Belle's threat: the figure, found inside the supposedly forbidden and dangerous Tenma Taro statue, reveals that the statue had already been breached, and that no malevolent supernatural consequence befell the village\u2014the \"ruin\" is a manufactured superstition. The presence of the Azuki Kozo Figure, together with its attached folklore about \"dirty money getting washed clean for giving out to the poor,\" also disproves the notion that Tenma Taro's secret is particularly dangerous or supernatural, highlighting the myth is a cover for hiding the true nature of the chamber's contents (a treasure), not something \"ruinous\" to the village if revealed.\n"

Examining the planner, we find that Professor Courte had documented scheduled reports from her \"snitch\" (Juniper), and there is no indication or record of Juniper forcing Means to prerecord the speech or threatening him. Instead, the planner shows Juniper was actively cooperating with Prof. Courte and acting to prevent wrongdoing, not making accomplices or issuing threats.

However, Evidence 12 (Shipley's Data) states that the cause of death was \"Thought to be from 65-ft fall into pool\" with signs of contusion from head trauma, but the details also mention, crucially, that the blow to the head was received after death. This implies that falling into the water could not have killed the victim; instead, the fatal injury happened when the victim struck something (like the skull rock) after already being dead or unconscious, invalidating the claim that the orca launched him into the water to kill him. Therefore, Testimony 3 directly contradicts Evidence 12.\n"

Specifically, the presence of the Defiant Dragons mark on the law book provides that it was made after the group's formation, which according to Datz and Dhurke was after Ga'ran's coming to power, i.e., after Amara's supposed assassination 23 years ago.  \n\nBut most critically, if the photo was taken after the assassination, and the baby being held by Amara is \"about 1 year old\" at the time (not 10), this means that Nahyuta could not have been reunited with his mother 15 years ago\u2014because that photo would have had to have been taken either well before that, or he would be much older. The math does not add up, creating a contradiction between Nahyuta's claimed timeline in his testimony and the photographic evidence of Amara and the baby (who he implies is himself) after the supposed assassination.  \n"

(While this statement alone does not directly contradict the photograph, it is part of Miss Brett's overall testimony, which attempts to imply that the accused shot Dr Wilson following the argument. However, the critical contradiction is between the descriptions of the shooting, as the testimonies try to frame Ryunosuke as shooting Dr Wilson after an argument, but the photograph gives physical evidence about the incident's circumstances.)\n\nHowever, if the requirement is to find one pair where the testimony is clearly contradicted by the evidence, the most direct and classic contradiction during Ace Attorney logic is the testimony:\n\n\"I don't carry a gun myself, so obviously I couldn't have been the culprit.\" (Testimony 5)\n\nIf there is evidence (like Photograph of Handbag, showing her handbag could conceal a gun), then that's a more direct contradiction. But with the evidence and testimonies listed, another contradiction is:\n\nTestimony 1: 'The professor was unable to eat, so I ordered for myself only. A beef steak.' (This implies she alone ordered/eat and there was only one steak.)\n\nBut in the Crime Scene Photograph (Evidence 4), there is a steak lunch on the victim's table, contradicting the claim that only Brett ate.\n\nThus, the most concrete contradiction based on available data is between:\n\nEvidence 4: Crime Scene Photograph (shows a steak lunch on the victim's table)\nTestimony 1: 'The professor was unable to eat, so I ordered for myself only.

The back cover is badly burnt. ... (additional context: This update to the description is entirely optional, and can only be achieved by examining the burnt corner on the back before it is specifically pointed out in court.) ...

The game establishes that he bought 5 books but only 4 appear at the crime scene. The fourth book ('The Lion's Pride') is mysteriously in the victim's hand and is not damaged in the same way as the others (and also was burnt, matching the fire at Garrideb's), suggesting that it came from elsewhere rather than directly from Natsume dropping them.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is:\n- Testimony 3 says he scattered (all) his belongings (the books) on the floor during his escape.\n- Evidence 3 shows the receipt for books, and the fact that one book is not accounted for among the books at the scene the way the police claim, casting doubt on the idea that all his belongings were scattered at the scene.\n\nSo, the pair is:\nEvidence 3 (Secondhand Book Receipt), Testimony 3 (\"The accused ran off, scatterin' his belongings all over the floor.\")\n"

But according to Testimony 5, Patricia admits she got lost on her way back because she lost her way after dropping the bouquet at the scene (see Evidence 10, Anniversary Bouquet), which means the scene could have been unattended for a long time and left undisturbed.\n\nHowever, if the question is for one direct contradiction between a piece of evidence and testimony from among those provided, the most direct contradiction is between Evidence 2 (Iris's Postcard), which gives a direct order from Iris to Gregson\u2014this is an item that the defense uses to gain information\u2014and Testimony 3, where Patricia claims she left the scene only very briefly and that nothing was disturbed while she was gone. But the bouquet remained at the scene (Evidence 10).\n\nBut the most proper direct contradiction is between Evidence 10 (Anniversary Bouquet), which was left at the scene, and Testimony 5: \"What happened was, I dropped my bouquet and ended up losing my way for a while.\" This proves that Patricia was not present at the scene for a considerable time and therefore, her husband could have taken his eyes off the scene, contrary to Testimony 6 (\"I didn't take my eye off the crime scene for one moment, sah!\"). Her absence provided an opportunity for something to be disturbed. However, that would be more between Testimony 5 and 6.\n\nBut since you asked for one pair between evidence and testimony, and among the original set, the clearest contradiction is:\n\nEvidence 2 (Iris's Postcard) and Testimony 3: Iris\u2019s Postcard compelled the inspector to tell the defense information he otherwise wouldn\u2019t give. Patricia claims she left the scene only briefly, confident her husband watched over it without disturbance, but in fact, the evidence shows there was a gap of time (from her own actions, as proven by the bouquet being left behind and her getting lost), which undermines the claim that nothing was disturbed and all was under observation.\n"

However, the Post-Mortem Report (Evidence 0) says the cause of death was trauma to the lung from a knife blade, but importantly, the \"only a single wound was identified\"\u2014and there is the note about extreme pupil constriction. Meanwhile, the chemical experiment (Evidence 6) confirms there is a specific reagent needed to detect the poison, and the murder weapon (Evidence 7) was tested but had **no trace** of poison.\n\nWith this, the contradiction is between:\nTestimony 3: \"It was nothing to do with Dr Wilson! We were discussing the stolen poison.\" (Rei)  \nand\nEvidence 2: Soseki Natsume Article, which does not mention the stolen poison at all\u2014only the conversation between Yujin and Soseki.  \n\nSo, the contradiction would be that according to Rei's testimony, she and Brett were arguing about the stolen poison, but the Soseki Natsume Article (the reporting on the notable events at the lab that day)\u2014and notably, Menimemo, the journalist/witness\u2014did not mention it, although he would if he had overheard something as crucial as a murder motive.\n\nThus:"

This contradicts the claim that he was \"stabbed by somethin' sharp right in the heart\", since the cage would prevent such a stabbing from taking place unless the object was inside the cage with the victim before the \"beaming.\"\n\nTherefore, there is a contradiction between Testimony 3 and Evidence 2.\n"

The Experiment Sketch and other evidence point to the existence of a contract between Asman and Drebber about the machine's construction (see also Evidence 18, but we're focusing here on the sketch illustrating another's involvement), meaning Asman was not the only one responsible for its creation or for enabling the experiment.

What's relevant is that the official coroner's report does not attribute the cause of death solely to the neck trauma\u2014rather, it lists both as significant wounds. This fact directly contradicts Sithe's attempt to claim death was due only to the neck injury. Therefore, the contradiction lies between Evidence 6 and Testimony 3.\n"

In cross-examination, Gossip also states: \"But then this old stiff came waddlin' along behind me, of course. Only him, mind.\"\n\nSo they're all present at the scene, and evidence\u2014the Crime Scene Floor Plan (Evidence 12)\u2014directly contradicts Sandwich's claim of being \"just a bystander\" rather than present in the room.\n\nBut is this a strong contradiction, or is there a more direct, indisputable conflict?\n\nLet me consider another point: does any physical evidence directly contradict a claim of not entering the room? Yes!\n\nEvidence 13: Noticeboard \u2014 which has a bloody handprint on the back, acknowledged to be left by Gossip as he fell. However, the story indicates that only Gossip and Sandwich were in the room, Venus was not at first; but then Venus testifies she may have peeked in.\n\nSandwich's claim is of being \"just a bystander,\" but in reality, in all the events, he was inside the room, which is shown by all the evidence and the witness accounts.\n\nBut does any piece of evidence physically tie Sandwich to the scene to contradict him? Not directly\u2014unless we use the Crime Scene Floor Plan. But that's more an implication.\n\nHowever, Sandwich (Testimony 3) says, \"I, I don't know anything about anything. I'm j-just a bystander, me. J-Just a sign at the crossroads of life.\" But the Crime Scene Floor Plan (Evidence 12) indicates he was at the scene and is even listed in the investigation. This is the contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n"

Let's look more closely at the remaining testimonies and evidence.\n\nTestimony 2: \"I never leave Fresno Street, alright? I've no interest in any Red-Headed League.\" (Gossip)\nIf Gossip never leaves Fresno Street, how could he have been the imposter who appeared as Inspector Gregson at the Red-Headed League event (in a park on Lime Street) and subsequently had a red ring on his neck (indicating he was the one impersonating Gregson and caught by de Rousseau and de Rossi)? The contradiction here is that Gossip claims he never leaves Fresno Street, but the evidence that supports he was the fake inspector is the Inspector's Identification (Evidence 17), which was used by the impostor DJ at the Red-Headed League event. Furthermore, the photograph of Mr Vigil (Evidence 2) would not be relevant; but the Inspector's Identification (Evidence 17) is directly relevant.\n\nHowever, let's focus on the testimonies and evidence provided.\n\nTestimony 2: \"I never leave Fresno Street, alright? I've no interest in any Red-Headed League.\"\nEvidence 17: Inspector's Identification -- \"The identification of a man claiming to be a detective inspector, confiscated by Mr de Rousseau and Mr de Rossi. Inspector Gregson's police identification.

But it turns out Gossip had a bruised red collar on his neck, indicating he was the imposter taken captive at the Red-Headed League event, so for him to claim he \"never leaves Fresno Street\" is a lie. The contradiction is between Testimony 2 and Evidence 17.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n"

Since the watch was an important, regularly-used item kept in good repair and wound daily, and the part is broken off and left in the cabin, it suggests the watch was damaged during the fatal encounter, not just thrown, and this ties the scene of violence (possibly the murder) to Jigoku's cabin. Therefore, Jigoku's testimony that it \"has nothing to do with his murder\" is contradicted by this decisive physical link between the broken watch and the scene.\n"

Caidin, however, claims a directive to impound the document came, and it was found in the robe in the cell (testimony 3 and 4). The implication\u2014supported by the nature of Evidence 19\u2014suggests the \"will\" found is not the original secret leverage Asogi held (\"the only weapon I have left\"), but a replacement/fake.

            "reasoning": "The testimony in question is Franziska's statement: \"...the plane hit that patch of turbulence, and out flew the body from within the suitcase!\" (Testimony 3). She is asserting that while Edgeworth was in the elevator with the victim's body (stuffed in the suitcase), the turbulence shook the plane and the body \"flew out\" of the suitcase. The contradiction arises when we consider the Crime Scene Notes (Evidence 2), which detail the condition of the crime scene:\n\n- The Crime Scene Notes state \"Body found at 6:15 AM inside elevator on 1st floor. Was hit on the back of his head. The victim slumps against the elevator wall. There is a string for a badge around his neck but the badge is missing. Money and cards are scattered on the floor. There is a statue shaped like a raccoon, too.\"\n- Significantly, the body was found *slumped against the wall*, NOT lying sprawled or ejected from a suitcase. If the turbulence had caused the body to \"fly out\" of the suitcase, as Franziska claims, the body would be found lying differently, and other related evidence (for instance, bruising patterns, placement of the suitcase, disruption to contents) would be mentioned.\n- Furthermore, there is no evidence or mention of the suitcase being discarded in the elevator after opening or the suitcase itself even being in the elevator after the incident, nor is there any suggestion that the body \"flew out.\"\n- Finally, the notes state \"money and cards are scattered on the floor,\" indicating the wallet's contents were released through a struggle or in the act of murder, not consistent with \"body flies out mid-turbulence.\"\n\nThus, Evidence 2 (Crime Scene Notes) directly contradicts Testimony 3 (Franziska's \"body flew out of suitcase during turbulence\" theory).\n"

            "reasoning": "Evidence 2 is Det. Gumshoe's Testimony, which states he was in the hall on guard duty and \"Other than gunshot, didn't hear a sign of a struggle.\"\n\nTestimony 3 is from Badd: \"...I didn't hear any other strange sounds... until that gunshot...\"\n\nThese two statements are contradictory because the crime scene evidence suggests there was no struggle (according to Det. Gumshoe's Testimony), yet the state of the crime scene and the plastic bags scattered about initially suggest otherwise. However, Badd's testimony that he only heard the gunshot and no other strange sounds corroborates Gumshoe's statement, rather than contradicting it.\n\nLet's look for a real contradiction using one pair.\n\nEvidence 3 is the Handgun, which, based on its forensic data, states: \"Bullet that killed Rell was fired from a few yards away.\"\n\nIf we take Badd's testimony 3, \"...I didn't hear any other strange sounds... until that gunshot...\", he would claim to have heard only the gunshot.\n\nThe contradiction found in the case is that there was no sound of a struggle, no loud commotion, but for the bodies to have ended up in a piled-up state, it would normally necessitate a struggle or noise. This connects to the fact that the evidence (the plastic bags scattered, the bodies piled together, and the distance of the gun firing) indicates a staged scene, something both testimonies overlook.\n\nBut the most direct contradiction and the one focused on in the game logic is between the evidence that Gumshoe didn't move from the hall and yet left fingerprints on the bench, indicating he did, in fact, move, but that is with Det. Gumshoe's Fingerprints and Gumshoe's testimony, not Badd's.\n\nGiven your list, the actual contradiction is between Badd's statement (\"...I didn't hear any other strange sounds... until that gunshot...\") and the Balloon Piece evidence (12), since the Judge heard the balloon pop and thought it was a gunshot, which means Badd, who says he never heard any other strange sounds until the gunshot, should have heard the balloon pop if he was there at the specified time.\n\nThus, the contradiction is between Badd's testimony 3 and Evidence 12 (Balloon Piece).\n"

This piece of evidence was missed or not properly accounted for by the investigators during their search. Its presence in the fireplace (and its link to Oldbag) proves that the investigation was not as thorough as Shih-na claims, since an item from a totally different room made its way into the fireplace and went undiscovered during their initial investigation. This is concrete proof that the Interpol team's investigation was flawed or incomplete, contradicting Shih-na's testimony about its thoroughness.\n"

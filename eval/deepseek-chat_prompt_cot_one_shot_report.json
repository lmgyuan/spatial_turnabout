This contradiction arises because Testimony 5 implies the act of stabbing was observed directly, while the actual weapon used (the hidden sword in the staff) contradicts the apparent weapon (Shichishito) mentioned elsewhere.\n\nThus, the testimony and evidence contradict each other because the testimony suggests a direct observation of the stabbing with the Shichishito, while the evidence reveals the actual weapon was hidden in the staff.\n"

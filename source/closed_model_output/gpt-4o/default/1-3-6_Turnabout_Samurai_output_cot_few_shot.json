When they asked grade school kids what they wanted to be, \"Steel Samurai\" was no. 1! ([no. 1] written as [no.1] in the original release)Phoenix:\nI really worry about kids these days.Maya:\nGramps! Well, the Steel Samurai's over. I guess it's time to close up the office.Phoenix:\nI guess... Wish we had some clients!Phoenix:\nA month has passed since my trial. Mia's murder was the talk of the town for some time... But no one paid any attention to the Wright & Co. Law Offices... How am I going to pay the rent this month?Maya:\nIt'll be okay. I'm sure some big client is just around the corner!Phoenix:\nHmph.October 16, 8:14 AMPhoenix Wright's BedroomCellular:\nBrrrrring... Brrrrring...*beep*Phoenix:\nH-hello?

Please, Nick!Cellular:*beep*October 16, 9:22 AMWright & Co. Law OfficesPhoenix:\n(Maya's here... watching television.)TV:\nNow for the morning news. The actor Will Powers was arrested yesterday. Powers plays the lead role in the popular kid's show \"The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo.\" He was arrested on suspicion of murder. The victim was Jack Hammer, who plays the villain known as the \"Evil Magistrate.\" His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. The \"Samurai Spear\" was also found stuck through the body. Police believe this was the murder weapon, and are investigating further.Phoenix:\n... This has to be a joke.Maya:\nNo, no, no! It's a nightmare! The Steel Samurai is over! The world is over!Cellular:\nBrrrrring... Brrrrring...*beep*Maya:\nYes... Wright & Co. Law Offices. ... What!? Nick! I-it's the Steel Samurai!Phoenix:\nW-what!?Maya:\nYes... yes, of course! We'll be right there!Cellular:*beep*Maya:\nLet's go, Nick!Phoenix:\nGo? Go where?Maya:\nThey have the Steel Samurai down in detention!Phoenix:\nSo what!?Maya:\nSo, I've decided this will be our first case!Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBookshelf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere's a horrendous amount of legal books here. Scarier still is the thought that I have to read all of these now.\n\n\n\n\nHouseplant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMia's favorite potted plant. Maya has been watering it so much lately it looks a little... swollen. She's either trying to make it grow... or she's perfecting her water torture technique.\n\n\n\n\nMovie poster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA poster of an old movie that Mia liked. I was thinking I should go see it myself. Then I realized that the poster doesn't actually say the title of the movie.\n\n\n\n\nDesk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMia's desk. Actually... it's my desk now. Sitting here always makes me feel like a professional.\n\n\n\n\nWindow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's a nice day outside. The hotel across the way is always full these days. There's the bellboy, happily cleaning the room.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to do\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, what should we do?\nMaya:\nWhat should we do!? How can you just sit there like that!? We have to get down to the detention center and meet the Steel Samurai!\nPhoenix:\n(Does she want to investigate this case or just do some sightseeing, I wonder? My money's on sightseeing.)\n\n\n\n\nAny ideas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nWe don't have enough information to make a case yet.\nPhoenix:\nJust admit it: you don't have a clue what happened.\nMaya:\nNo! We just don't have enough information!Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat about this?\nMaya:\nYou like showing that off, don't you, Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(My poor, poor ego...)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat about this?\nMaya:\nSorry, but I don't see how that will help us figure this out...October 16Detention CenterVisitor's RoomMaya:\n...Phoenix:\nWhat's wrong, Maya? It's him! In the flesh!Maya:\nUmm... Is that guy really him?Phoenix:\nWhaddya mean \"that guy\"? Of course it's him! Will Powers, our client! That's him.Maya:\nUm, maybe I shouldn't be saying this... But he definitely did it. Murder. At least once. Maybe twice.Phoenix:\nWhoa whoa whoa! What are you saying!?Will:\nUmm...Maya:\nY-yes!?Will:\nSomething wrong...?Maya:\nN-no! No!Phoenix:\n(This is getting off to a great start.)Will:\nI know, I know. You're disappointed, aren't you?Maya:\nD-disappointed!? Oh, no. Oh no.Will:\nNo, it's okay. This is the real me. When I got the part of the Steel Samurai, with that mask... I decided I would never show my face in public until the job was over. It's the kids, you know. I didn't want to wreck their dreams.Maya:\nOh...Will:\nI guess it didn't matter. So much for dreams. I wonder what they think of the Steel Samurai now. *sniff* Uwaaah!Maya:\nNick!Phoenix:\nWhat?Maya:\nHe's a good guy! I mean, he's good!Phoenix:\nYeah.Maya:\nHe didn't do it!Phoenix:\n...Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecurity camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSmile for the camera...\n\n\n\n\nSecurity guard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room. He seems frozen in awe of Will Powers.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMaybe you could start by telling us what happened.\nWill:\nY-yes. Of course. It seems like it was only yesterday. Actually, it was only yesterday. The cast had come down to Global Studios for a run-through. We went through a few action sequences at 10:00 that morning. There was a rehearsal scheduled for 5:00 in the afternoon. But when 5:00 came around, and the staff gathered at the studio... The Evil Magistrate was found lying in a crumpled heap near the set. They took off his mask... And discovered that it was Jack Hammer... dead! He had been expertly skewered with the Samurai Spear.\nPhoenix:\nThe \"Samurai Spear\"...?\nWill:\nYes, it's a long spear that I... that the Steel Samurai uses as a weapon.\n\n\n\n\nThe Steel Samurai\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMaybe you could explain to me just what \"the Steel Samurai\" is.\nMaya:\nNick! How could you say such a thing? I-I'm sorry, sir, I apologize for my partner! He's new to this, and a bit OUT OF TOUCH with the world.\nPhoenix:\nHey! Who's \"new to this\"!?\nWill:\nNo, it's alright, really. The Steel Samurai is the lead character in a popular kid's show. He walks the streets of Neo Olde Tokyo... Fighting battle after battle against the Evil Magistrate and his minions. Of course, he never really defeats the Evil Magistrate. Although... I guess he did defeat him this time... *sniff* Uwaaah!\nPhoenix:\nI-I see. (Neo Olde Tokyo...? Who comes up with these names!?)\n\n\n\n\nPowers's alibi (appears after \"What happened\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nNow, where were you on the day of the murder?\nWill:\nWell, that morning I came to studios at 9:00. We worked through some action scenes until noon. Rehearsal was to begin at 5:00, but I was a little tired. So after lunch, I took a nap in my dressing room. When I woke up, it was after 5:00! I was late for the rehearsal! I hurried to the studio... and found everyone looking shocked. They arrested me on the spot, and brought me here.\nPhoenix:\n(So he was sleeping the entire afternoon of the murder? Some action hero!)\nWill:\nWhat will the kids think? *sniff*Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm, here.\nWill:\nI... I see. ...\nPhoenix:\n(Let me guess... this guy wasn't the top student in improv class.)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill:\nI-I'm sorry. I'm sure that's very important and all. I just don't see what it has to do with my problem.After clearing \"Powers's alibi\" Talk option:Phoenix:\nI think I should probably check out the scene of the murder...Will:\nRight... Global Studios. I'll draw you a map.Maya:\nWow! Nick! Let's go!Phoenix:\n(I'm willing to bet 10 bucks she asks for autographs.)Wright & Co. Law Offices (after clearing \"Powers's alibi\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room)Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to do\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, what should we do?\nMaya:\nSitting around here won't get us anywhere, that's for sure. The studio! We should go to the studio! I'm sure we could find some clues there!\nPhoenix:\n(Does she want to investigate this case or just do some sightseeing, I wonder? My money's on sightseeing.)October 16Global StudiosMain GateMaya:\nWow! So this is where they make the Steel Samurai show! Awesome! Aren't you excited!?Oldbag:\nHey! You there! You want in, you gotta go through me!Maya:\nO-oh... s-sorry! W-we're, um, lawyers.Oldbag:\nOh yeah? Well that's great. I'm security! And it's my job to make sure that gawkers like you stay OUT.Maya:\nG-gawkers?Oldbag:\nGawkers! Sightseers! Tourists!!! I know the type. You heard about the incident and came to snoop around. Youths today! Something horrible happens and all you can think of is sightseeing. Wasting your time at a place like this. Don't you have jobs you should be doing? Or do lawyers not work like the rest of us? Maybe I should become a lawyer too. Sounds like a life of ease to me no work just loafing around all day as you please. Well when I was young things were a mite different, mind you we didn't prance around in strange hippie clothes. What are the youths coming to these days my own son hasn't called in...Maya:\nUmm... Nick? Will I grow up to be like her? Please say \"no.\"Phoenix:\nI dunno! It's possible.Oldbag:\nHey! Listen when you're being spoken to! Youths today!Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe computer that runs the studio security cameras.\nOldbag:\nHey! No touching!\n\n\n\n\nGuard station\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe security guard station. That security lady must like junk food. There's a mountain of it on the desk in there. I can see the computer that runs the security cameras.\n\n\n\n\nMain gate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe main entrance to the studio. There was a big scene here yesterday with onlookers pressing up against the gate.\n\n\n\n\nStudio map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAn overhead map of the studios. Right from here is the Employee Area. To the left are the actual film studios.\n\n\n\n\nStudio van\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nLooks like a studio van. They probably use it to carry around film equipment.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe studios\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, what do you do here at the studios?\nOldbag:\nAt Global Studios, we make children's dreams come true! In fact, in my younger days...\nMaya:\nNo! You were a star!?\nOldbag:\nOnly a little twinkle between the stars here, I'm afraid, dearie.\nMaya:\nWo... wow.\nOldbag:\nThis place has really gone downhill, you know? But 10 years ago, now that was a studio of dreams! Hammer was a big star back then too, he was...\nPhoenix:\nHammer...?\nOldbag:\nThe victim, dummy! The Evil Magistrate! He's been reduced to playing villains now. Not exactly the best material to work with...\n\n\n\n\nWill Powers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nCan you tell me about Mr. Will Powers?\nOldbag:\nHe's not a bad kid, but don't be fooled by his mask! You wouldn't want him on the silver screen without it, believe me. Little old ladies watching would lose their lunch! That's probably why he thought that the Steel Samurai was his \"big chance.\" No one thought he was capable of doing what he did to poor Jack Hammer...\nMaya:\nWe don't know for certain that Will Powers is guilty!\nOldbag:\nPowers? Of course he's guilty! How do I know? I know everything! That's my job.\n\n\n\n\nMr. Hammer (appears after \"The studios\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of person was Jack Hammer?\nOldbag:\nWhat \"kind of person\"? Oh... if you only knew! Jack Hammer will live on in many hearts as the ultimate action hero! He was simply dashing in the Dynamite Samurai series!\nPhoenix:\n(Should I have heard of that...?)\nOldbag:\nBut... there was an accident during filming five years ago. He got an unlucky break after that. Reduced to playing the villain on a children's program! What's more, I heard they were paying him peanuts. It's enough to make you cry.\n\n\n\n\nReason for suspicion (appears after \"Will Powers\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy are you so certain Mr. Powers is the killer?\nOldbag:\nI was standing right here yesterday, I was. I was here from 1:00 in the afternoon, to 5:00, when they found the body! Now the studio where the murder took place is to the left here. So if you want to go to the studio, you have to pass by me! Only one person went by here between 1:00 and 2:30, when the murder took place!\nPhoenix:\nAnd... that person was Mr. Powers?\nOldbag:\nYes. I saw him!\nPhoenix:\nBut Mr. Powers says he was sleeping in his dressing room.\nOldbag:\nOh, I'm sure he would say that. He's no fool! But he was the only one that walked by. He's the killer, you can bet your biscuits on it.Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOldbag:\nWhat's that? You giving that to me?\nPhoenix:\n(Absolutely not!)After clearing all Talk options:Oldbag:\nIsn't it about time for you to be heading home? There's nothing to see here. Move along.Phoenix:\nUm, actually, we're here at Mr. Powers's request.Oldbag:\nHmph! I thought you were suspicious lookin'! Show me a \"letter of request.\" And maybe I'll just let you in.Maya:\nThis lady here thinks she owns this place, obviously.Detention CenterWill:\nHello! How was the studio? They all think I did it, don't they?Maya:\nN-no, not at all! Isn't that right, Nick?Phoenix:\nRight, not at all. At worst, you're a suspect.Will:\n*sniff*Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour alibi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. Powers, you aren't hiding anything from me, are you?\nWill:\nW-what? No! I'd never do that!\nPhoenix:\nJust now you said that you were sleeping in your dressing room after lunch.\nWill:\nYes. Like a baby.\nPhoenix:\nBut the security lady said she saw you that day. She says she saw you heading towards the scene of the crime!\nWill:\nW-what!? That's not possible! I... I really don't know what to say! I was sleeping, I promise!\nPhoenix:\nMr. Powers, if you want me to help you, you have to tell me the truth. I'm new to this lawyer business, and I need every advantage I can get.\nWill:\nI know... I-I'm sorry. *sniff* But, I swear to you on my momma's grave, I was sleeping. Maybe the security lady only thought she saw me?\nPhoenix:\n(What did she see...? He doesn't seem to be lying.)\n\n\n\n\nThe security lady\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUmm... about the security guard at the main gate to the studio...\nWill:\nOh, the security lady?\nMaya:\nShe's terrible! She called me \"suspicious lookin'\"!\nWill:\nY-yes... actually, she's said the same thing to me before. \"Take off that mask!\" were her words, I believe. She sucks up to all the bigwigs at the studio... But let her see you stumble once and she'll never let up on you.\nMaya:\nGrr! She's got some nerve!\nPhoenix:\nDo you think you could write up a letter formally requesting my representation?\nWill:\nOf c-course.\nPowers's Request added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\n(I just hope this will get me past that security lady.)\n\n\n\n\nThe security lady (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUmm... about the security guard at the main gate to the studio...\nWill:\nOh, the security lady?\nMaya:\nShe's terrible! She called me \"suspicious lookin'\"!\nWill:\nY-yes... actually, she's said the same thing to me before. \"Take off that mask!\" were her words, I believe. She sucks up to all the bigwigs at the studio... But let her see you stumble once and she'll never let up on you.\nMaya:\nGrr! She's got some nerve!Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPowers's Letter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThank you for the letter of request.\nWill:\nShow that to the security lady and she should let you in.Wright & Co. Law OfficesPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPowers's Letter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHey, look what I have!\nMaya:\nHey! The Steel Samurai said we'd need that to get into the studio.\nPhoenix:\nYou mean Will Powers said we'd need it...?\nMaya:\nYes, the Steel Samurai.\nPhoenix:\n*sigh*Studio - Main GatePresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPowers's Letter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ma'am, have a look at this.\"Phoenix:\nMa'am, have a look at this. It's a letter of request from Mr. Powers.Oldbag:\nHmm...? Yes, yes. I recognize the bold, childish scrawl.Gave Powers's Request to the security lady.Oldbag:\nTo think he would entrust his fate to youths of such unreliable appearance... Really!Phoenix:\nReally?Oldbag:\nAnyway, you may pass. But only left from here, toward the studios! No going to the right. That's the Employee Area. \"No one allowed inside, pal\" were my instructions. The good detective told me himself.Maya:\nHey, hey, Nick.Phoenix:\nHuh?Maya:\nThere were maps in the security guard station.Phoenix:\nHey! Not bad!Oldbag:\nThose are 50 cents a piece,\nthank you!Maya:\nWell, time to go, Nick.Oldbag:\n50 cents!Guidemap of Global Studios added to the Court Record.October 16Studio One EntranceGumshoe:\nHey! Aren't you that murderer from the other day!Maya:\nAah! It's that confused detective!Gumshoe:\nHey pal, you know Prosecutor Edgeworth is all upset, and it's your fault! I saw him sipping tea and staring gloomily out the window!Phoenix:\nUmm... so?Maya:\nHey! If he's depressed, it's all your fault for doing sloppy detective work!Gumshoe:\n!!! ... ... ...Maya:\nUm, Detective?Phoenix:\nI think you hurt his feelings.Maya:\nOh no! I... I'm sorry!Phoenix:\nWell, I think his feelings are easily hurt.Gumshoe:\nYou're right, pal. It's all my fault. I can blame other people all I want, but I know the truth in my heart!Maya:\nHey, hey! Don't take it so hard! There's always the next case!Gumshoe:\nYeah, I suppose you're right. Hey! What exactly are you two doing here?Maya:\nUm, well... We're on this case too, pal!Gumshoe:\nHuh!? Hey! You can't just go saying \"pal\" like that! That's MY endearing character trait!Maya:\nI'd say he's a character alright...Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBench\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI'm a little bushed. Maybe I'll take a short rest here.\nGumshoe:\nHey, good idea, pal!\nMaya:\nDetective! Aren't you on the case?\nGumshoe:\nW-well, yeah, but... Hey, us detectives get tired of standing around too, pal!\n\n\n\n\nLeft path\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe, what's down the path to the left? It looks like a tree fell down over the path...?\nGumshoe:\nOh, yeah. That way's kind of dangerous. You should stay out, pal. There's nothing down there, anyway. That's where Studio Two used to be, they tell me. They don't use it now, though.\n\n\n\n\nStatue with broken head\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe studio mascot. I guess it's a monkey of some kind. But what kind of monkey has a nose like that? He's holding a sign in his hand. [Right: To Studio One; Left: To Studio Two]\nMaya:\nWhat's up with that thing!? It looks kind of... busted.\nGumshoe:\nOh, the wind was pretty strong yesterday, and the head broke off. It took that tree down with it, too.\n\n\n\n\nSecurity camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHey, there's a camera here.\nGumshoe:\nThat's the security camera. It takes photos of people going to the studio. All you have to do is look at the data and you can see who went where!\nPhoenix:\nThere's a number plate on the camera... [ST1-307]. That must be the camera ID number.\n\n\n\n\nStudio One entrance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.\nMaya:\nLet's go in and check it out, Nick! ... Hey! It's locked!\nPhoenix:\nLooks like you need a cardkey to get in. It makes sense that they would want to keep the non-employees out.\n\n\n\n\nWelcome sign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nThere's a big welcome sign above the path.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, apparently the studio's fallen on tough times. They've started letting people in on days they aren't filming. They make a bit of extra money by charging for admission.\nMaya:\nHuh. You sure know a lot about this place, Detective. You know, you could always quit being a detective and work here?\nPhoenix:\nYeah! And what perfect timing, with the monkey's neck broken and all.\nGumshoe:\nHuh? Just what's that supposed to mean, pal!?Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe investigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, how is your investigation going, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nWell, it's... Hey! I can't tell you that, pal.\nMaya:\nNick... Maybe you need to be a little more indirect with your questions?\nPhoenix:\nRight. So, Detective, mind if I take a look at what you got?\nGumshoe:\nWhat I got?\nPhoenix:\nThe autopsy report! The latest version, if you please...\nGumshoe:\nHmm... right, right. Sorry about what happened last time, pal.\nAutopsy Report added to the Court Record.\n\n\n\n\nThe investigation (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, how is your investigation going, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nI'm not at liberty to give you any more information, pal. You'll hear all you need to know in court!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh well, it was worth a try.)\n\n\n\n\nReason for arrest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy was Mr. Powers arrested?\nGumshoe:\nSimple, pal! The murder took place right over there in Studio One. Now, the victim entered Studio One at approximately 1:00 PM. At that time, there was no one other than the victim in the studio. According to the autopsy report, the time of death was 2:30 PM. Only one person went to the studio between 1:00 and 2:30! And that person was none other than Will Powers! No one else, pal! If you think I'm lying, ask the security lady at the main gate.\nMaya:\nNick! If that's true...! Anyone would think that Powers did it with that kind of evidence!\nPhoenix:\nThanks for cheering me up...\n\n\n\n\nThe security lady\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAbout the security lady...\nGumshoe:\nOh, that sweet old lady. What a charmer!\nPhoenix:\nHuh? A-are we talking about the same person?\nGumshoe:\nWhen I showed her my badge she gave me a donut and some coffee!\nMaya:\nRemember what Powers said. She's a sucker for authority.\nGumshoe:\nShe even gave me a piece of valuable evidence!\nMaya:\nWhaat!?\n\n\n\n\nDecisive evidence (appears after \"The security lady\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of evidence!?\nGumshoe:\nWell, that, er, photo. The photo of the Steel Samurai heading toward the scene of the crime!\nMaya:\nWhat! Who took that!?\nGumshoe:\nSee the camera up on that gate, pal?\nMaya:\nThe gate? You mean the one with the welcome sign?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. Whenever someone walks by, that camera automatically snaps a photo of them!\nMaya:\nOh no! Nick, he has evidence! We're finished!\nPhoenix:\n(Funny, for someone with hard proof he doesn't look too happy.)\nGumshoe:\n...Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nDetective, see this? This is my attorney's badge.\nGumshoe:\nUh huh? Don'tcha think it's a little sad when you have to explain what your badge means, pal? Real men show their P.D. badge and that's that!\nPhoenix:\nI'll admit the design of my badge leaves a lot to be desired...\nMaya:\nMaybe it should just be a big \"L\" for \"Lawyer\"?\nPhoenix:\nHmm... I'm not so sure about that.\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm, Detective. Any ideas about this?\nGumshoe:\nLook, I don't got time to look at every little trinket you got, okay pal?After clearing \"The investigation\" and \"Decisive evidence\" Talk options:Gumshoe:\nWhat's wrong, pal? You seem down.Phoenix:\nDon't look so happy when you say that.Gumshoe:\nOh hoh hoh hoh hoh!Maya:\nUmm... We'd like to ask the employees here some questions...Gumshoe:\nSure thing, pal. Go wherever you like. Of course, you're not going to find any clues I haven't already found! Hah hah hah!Phoenix:\n(I'm glad someone around here seems to be enjoying themselves.)Maya:\nNick, let's go! We've got a free pass to the place. Now's our chance to check things out!Studio - Main GateMaya:\nNick! Look! That security lady is in the guard station stuffing her face with donuts! I guess all cops like their donuts!Phoenix:\nYeah, and they're soft enough she doesn't need teeth to chew them...Oldbag:\nHey, you! Well? Are you satisfied Powers is guilty yet?Phoenix:\n(Urk! She had to make my life harder by giving that photo to Detective Gumshoe...)Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotographic proof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy didn't you tell us about the security photo, ma'am?\nOldbag:\nHmm? Oh, that? I just thought it would be more thrilling to talk with the detective himself! These things are important, you know. Oh, just to the left from here is the gate with the camera that took that photo. It's my job to check the photos every day, you see.\n\n\n\n\nReason for suspicion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOldbag:\nThis guard station is in a central position. No matter where you go here, you pass by my station first! Now poor Hammer, he went to the studio just before 1:00. The murder happened right around 2:30, see? The only one I seen go through here between 1:00 and 2:30 was Powers himself! The security camera got a good look at him too. If he's not the one what did it, I don't know who is!\nPhoenix:\nMaybe... it was you?\nOldbag:\nGyah hah ha hah! Good one, sonny.\nPhoenix:\n(She thinks I was joking.)\n\n\n\n\nMr. Hammer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWas the victim, Mr. Hammer, a popular actor?\nOldbag:\nOh, he was the biggest star in the studio!\nPhoenix:\n(\"Was\"? Past tense?)\nMaya:\nOh yes! He was great as the \"Bearded Samurai\"!\nOldbag:\nThat too, yes. He shone the brightest! Back in the day. Making a star like him play the \"Evil Magistrate\"... It's a disgrace, I tell you! Hammer took it pretty hard, and who can blame him?\n\n\n\n\nAutomatic camera (appears after \"Photographic proof\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAbout the security camera...\nOldbag:\nOh yes, the camera. It's automatic. It can tell when someone walks through that gate, see? Then it snaps a photo! Apparently, it records the time when it takes a picture too. But I don't bother myself with those details. I just view all the photos on the computer over in the security guard station. I check 'em every day before going home, I do.October 16Wright & Co. Law OfficesMaya:\nWhat's going on, Nick!? Powers said he was sleeping in his dressing room! But now there's a photo of him going to the studio!?Phoenix:\nDon't look at me! How should I know?Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to do\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you think?\nMaya:\nThat photo the detective was talking about is the problem here.\nPhoenix:\nWell, that's hard to say, without seeing the actual photo ourselves. But if it is Powers in that photo, his alibi is shot.\n\n\n\n\nPhotographic proof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOnly one person went to the scene of the crime before the murder took place. And there's a photograph to prove it.\nMaya:\nI guess it makes sense that that person is the killer then. What do we do, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nMaybe there was someone else who could have gone to the scene other than Powers? Let's take a look. Maybe that security lady missed someone?\nMaya:\nOn thing's for sure, if there are any clues, they'll be in that studio.October 16Detention CenterVisitor's RoomPhoenix:\n...Maya:\nApparently they have Mr. Powers in questioning.Phoenix:\nHmm... right.Gumshoe:\nLook pal, that camera takes a picture automatically whenever someone walks by.

Let's try again later.Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecurity guard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room. He must get pretty bored.

No one's here this soon after the murder I guess. Let's take a look around!Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBicycle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nLooks like one of those electric-powered bicycles.

That's a pretty big drain. A kid could fit through there, I bet.\nMaya:\nYeah, if you snuck in that way you wouldn't have to pay at the gate!\nPhoenix:\nWell, if you want to leave that way, be my guest.\nMaya:\nRight! Huh? Hey! I'm not a kid!\n\n\n\n\nGrate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe grate that used to cover the drain. It's a little bent.

Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak.\nMaya:\nMmm! T-bone steak! That would have hit the spot.\nPhoenix:\nYou just had a burger!\nMaya:\nYeah, but I have a second stomach just for steaks.\nPhoenix:\n(What!?)\n\n\n\n\nStage backdrop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere's a half-finished backdrop for a stage here.

WP and Hammer were there, along with everyone else.\nPhoenix:\nThe employee area--that's where Powers's dressing room is, right?\nPenny:\nYes, that's the place.

The only thing we had scheduled was an action scene run-through. I was the only assistant here that day.

Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution will show the court that at 2:30 PM on October 15, the defendant, Mr. Will Powers, killed fellow actor Jack Hammer at Studio One of Global Studios. It is impossible for anyone else to have committed this heinous crime. The evidence presented during the trial will all point to this fact.Judge:\nHmm. I see. Very well, I would like to move on to your testimony. Mr. Edgeworth, the prosecution may call its first witness.Edgeworth:\nVery well, I call a most familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand. (Changed from [First, I would like to call a familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand.] in the original release)Edgeworth:\nDetective, if you would briefly describe this case to the court?Gumshoe:\nYes sir! I'll explain with the guidemap here. To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see? This here is the Employee Area. The actors did a run-through of their action scenes during the morning here. This is the main gate to the studios. The security lady that works at the studios was here at 1:00 PM on that day. Past the security station there is a gate, see? Past that are the studios. And here it is... Studio One. This is the scene of the murder, where the body was found! Now, on the day of the murder, October 15, there were only three people here. The victim, Jack Hammer, the defendant, Will Powers, and a young woman, the production assistant. All the production staff were in the Employee Area until noon. Then after lunch, the victim, Jack Hammer, went to Studio One. Right after that, at 1:00 PM, the security lady got to the guard station. Now, jump ahead to later that day... 5:00 PM. The production staff came to Studio One to perform a rehearsal. Needless to say, the rehearsal was cancelled... The time of death was 2:30 PM. The \"Samurai Spear\" found lodged in the victim's chest was the murder weapon. That's the case, in brief. Anyone like to hear that again?Phoenix:\n(Hmm... should I listen to that whole thing again...?)Skip it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"I think I can probably remember that...\"Listen again\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry, could you describe that one more time?\nGumshoe:\nI shoulda known it would be you, pal!

Hmm? My, aren't you a handsome fellow! I'm afraid I'm a bit flustered!Edgeworth:\nY-your name, please!Oldbag:\nOh, dearie! No need for you to be embarrassed! Just call me \"grandma.\"Edgeworth:\nYOUR NAME, PLEASE!Phoenix:\n(Seems Edgeworth has a bit of trouble getting his witnesses to say their names...)Oldbag:\nWendy Oldbag, dearie. So just call me \"grandma.\" It's practically my name! So even when I was young I was an Oldbag, but not really that was just my name dearie. Still how the other children would make fun of me and just because of my name can you believe it? But there was this boy, the captain of the chess club in junior high, and when he called me an old bag well I just cried and cried because I had a crush on him you see--Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nO-objection! I... object to the witness's talkativeness.Judge:\nObjection sustained! The witness will refrain from rambling on the stand.Oldbag:\nI was just getting to the good part, dearie!Edgeworth:\nPerhaps we can get to the testimony?Judge:\nNow, the witness was stationed at the main gate on the day of the murder, correct?Oldbag:\nYessey I was.Judge:\nAnd to get to the scene of the murder, someone would have to pass by you?Oldbag:\nYou know your stuff, dearie!Judge:\n... You may begin your testimony.Phoenix:\n(She sure is one hell of an Oldbag...)Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Oldbag:\nOn the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.\nPoor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.\nI, well, I had some errands to run that morning.\nAnyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.\nI was at the main gate from then until 5:00!\nNow, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?\nInteresting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.\nIt was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!Judge:\nYou saw the defendant, then? Hmm... Very well. Let's begin the cross-examination. Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.Cross Examination-- Witness's Account --Oldbag:\nOn the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo up until that time, anyone who wanted to could go into the studio?\nOldbag:\nWell, there wasn't a security guard at the gate, no. But the main gate was locked, dearie. You'd need an employee cardkey to get in.\nPhoenix:\n(Right... the cardkey that I have. So, what she's saying is no one who wasn't supposed to be there could get in.)\nEdgeworth:\nWas there anyone at the studios when you arrived at the guard station?Oldbag:\nPoor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nA \"run-through\"...?\nOldbag:\nThey were working out a scene between the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate. They got the basics figured out by noon, and were to use the afternoon for practice. Rehearsal was supposed to start at 5:00. That's why poor old Hammer went to Studio One in the afternoon.\nPhoenix:\n(So Powers was in his dressing room sleeping... when he was supposed to be practicing! Talk about a laid-back hero...)\nEdgeworth:\nIf there was a run-through in the morning, why did you only get there after noon?Oldbag:\nI, well, I had some errands to run that morning.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of \"errands\"?\nOldbag:\nOh, well, you know.\nPhoenix:\nAnswer the question!\nOldbag:\nActually... I was watching poor Hammer and Powers. Observing, you know?\nPhoenix:\nO-observing? Weren't you supposed to be at the guard station?\nOldbag:\nWhippersnapper! I told you I locked the gate, didn't I? I did my job!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not sure your boss would see it that way...)\nOldbag:\nAnyway! I always watch Hammer's run-throughts. Always! Never missed one in all my years.\nMaya:\nWow! I want to see a Steel Samurai run-through too!\nPhoenix:\nYou could quit being a spirit medium and take up guard duty.\nMaya:\nNot a bad idea...Oldbag:\nAnyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid you see the victim then?\nOldbag:\nDid I see poor old Hammer? Nope. He'd already gone to the studio before I got back to the guard station.\nEdgeworth:\nTell us what happened next.Oldbag:\nI was at the main gate from then until 5:00!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you were watching there the WHOLE time? No breaks? Not even a second?\nOldbag:\nO-of course! I am a professional, you know! Our are you criticizing how I do my job!? Whippersnapper!\nPhoenix:\nNo, it's just, after seeing you eating those donuts in the guard station yesterday...\nOldbag:\nI can watch the gate and eat donuts at the same time! Snipperwhapper!\nMaya:\n\"Snipperwhapper\"...? Old windbag is losing it, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWhy don't you raise an objection?\nJudge:\nSo, the witness was on duty through the afternoon, the whole time. Very well. What did you see?Oldbag:\nNow, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow did you know that?\nOldbag:\nOh hoh hoh. I have my ways! That over-dressed young detective told me. I fed him some donuts and he talked and talked... If you ask me, that detective isn't cut out for his job.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Detective Gumshoe, getting chewed out by a security guard...)Oldbag:\nInteresting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n2:00? You're sure?\nOldbag:\nSure as spit!\nJudge:\nWell, who was the man!?\nOldbag:\nReally, you should try not to get so excited at your age. You might strain something.\nJudge:\n...\nOldbag:\nNow, now, don't get your skivvies all in a bunch. I'll tell you who it was!Present Powers's(?) Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag!\"Oldbag:\nIt was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you saw Mr. Powers?\nOldbag:\nThat's what I said! Got wax in your ears, sonny?\nMaya:\nNick, this is your chance!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, time to pull out the secret weapon...\nOldbag:\nI'll say it again! It was him!Present Powers's(?) Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag!\"Maya:\nNick... Doesn't she seem like she's enjoying this a little too much?Phoenix:\nWindbags love gossiping about other people's misfortunes.Maya:\nUgh. Can't she get her kicks somewhere else?Phoenix:\nLet me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag! You've been saying since yesterday that you \"saw Mr. Powers,\" correct? But you're talking about the man in this photo, aren't you!Judge:\nJ-just a moment, Mr. Wright. Let me see that photo! ... What is this, exactly?Phoenix:\nNone other than the Steel Samurai, defender of Neo Olde Tokyo. Ms. Oldbag! Is this the \"Mr. Powers\" that you saw!?Oldbag:\nOf course! Didn't your momma teach you any sense, sonny? Anyone can plainly see that's Powers! Right?Edgeworth:\nNo, they can't! (Changed from [Um, yeah.] in the original release) ... Umm... well. I mean, I wonder? (Changed from [Umm... well. I wonder?] in the original release)Phoenix:\nTrue, Mr. Powers does play the role of the Steel Samurai! But that doesn't mean Mr. Powers IS the Steel Samurai!Oldbag:\n...! I... I know that! I wasn't born yesterday!Judge:\nNo one in this court is accusing you of that, Ms... er, witness.Phoenix:\n(He's having trouble calling her \"Oldbag\" apparently...)Judge:\nHowever, you do not have proof that the person in this photo is Mr. Will Powers, do you?Oldbag:\nHumph! Nosy old man! Of course I have proof!Phoenix:\nWhat!?Edgeworth:\nHuh!?Phoenix:\n(Even Edgeworth is surprised!?)Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution would like to ask the old... the witness. Please make known all the information in your possession ahead of time!Oldbag:\nHow was I to know everyone would be so nosy! You should be ashamed, all of you! Anyway, I showed that photo to the young detective. He told me \"this isn't any good as evidence, pal.\" He didn't even give it a second look!Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\n(Wow, old windbag has left even Edgeworth speechless. She's good!)Judge:\nLet's hear about your proof, then.Witness Testimony-- The Man in the Photo --Oldbag:\nI never say anything I don't mean, mind you!\nThat morning, during the run-through of the action scene...\nI saw Powers trip and fall!\nHe broke one of the props, it was a big mess.\nApparently, he sprained his ankle pretty bad.\nNow, look at that picture!\nYou can see he's dragging his leg! See? Clear as day!\nThat's how I knew it was Powers. Happy?Judge:\nHmm. So he had sprained his ankle...? Very well. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Phoenix:\n(She's got to be hiding something... I'll press her until she squeals.)Cross Examination-- The Man in the Photo --Oldbag:\nI never say anything I don't mean, mind you!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nOldbag:\nWhippersnapper!\nPhoenix:\n(Hey, I haven't said anything yet!)\nOldbag:\nI'll have you know I'm not pointing fingers at anyone behind their backs! Everything I've said is on the straight and narrow! The up and up! Youth today! Always whining about each other, pointing fingers this way and that! It's enough to make an old lady want to cry...\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Wright! Please, for all our sakes, try not to upset the witness!\nPhoenix:\n(I think Edgeworth has met his match...)Oldbag:\nThat morning, during the run-through of the action scene...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWho was present at the run-through?\nOldbag:\nWell, let's see... There was Powers, he's the Steel Samurai... Then poor old Hammer, the Evil Magistrate. And... me.\nJudge:\nAnd what exactly were you doing?\nOldbag:\nObserving! Just... observing.\nPhoenix:\nWhat about the assistant?\nOldbag:\nOh, she was off moving backdrops around and such.\nPhoenix:\n(So she didn't see the run-through, then...)Oldbag:\nI saw Powers trip and fall!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Trip and fall\"...?\nOldbag:\nYes! And to think, he's supposed to be the Steel Samurai! What a laugh! So Powers sprained his ankle. I helped make it better for him, of course.\nJudge:\nYou... helped make it better?\nOldbag:\nI kissed it where it hurt.\nJudge:\nL-let's just skip over that part, shall we?\nPhoenix:\nWhere was the assistant then?\nOldbag:\nOh, her? She was cleaning up backdrops, I think. She didn't know about Powers's ankle.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm...)\nEdgeworth:\nYou may continue your testimony.Oldbag:\nHe broke one of the props, it was a big mess.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe broke a prop?\nOldbag:\nSure did! His own Samurai Spear.\nPhoenix:\n(His Samurai Spear... the murder weapon!?)\nOldbag:\nLuckily I was there with my duct tape to fix it.\nPhoenix:\n(This strikes me as a significant detail... I'd better write this down in the Court Record.)\nSamurai Spear updated in the Court Record.Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe broke a prop?\nOldbag:\nSure did! His own Samurai Spear.\nPhoenix:\n(His Samurai Spear... the murder weapon!?)\nOldbag:\nLuckily I was there with my duct tape to fix it.\nPhoenix:\n(This strikes me as a significant detail...)Oldbag:\nApparently, he sprained his ankle pretty bad.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWas Mr. Power's [sic] ankle badly sprained?\nOldbag:\nNot so bad that he couldn't walk around. He went to his dressing room to rest up after lunch.\nPhoenix:\n(Thus the nap...)\nOldbag:\nAnyway, I saw him dragging his foot when he walked.\nPhoenix:\n(Dragging his foot... okay.)Oldbag:\nYou can see he's dragging his leg! See? Clear as day!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely sure? (Let's take a look at that picture again... Hmm... so he was walking strangely because he was injured...)\nJudge:\nHmm. It does look like he was dragging his foot.\nOldbag:\nSee! And you didn't trust me! Whippersnapper!Oldbag:\nThat's how I knew it was Powers. Happy?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nStill, you can't look at this and say it's Mr. Powers!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYes, but only Mr. Powers would have been dragging his leg!\nJudge:\nHe has a point. It does seem quite likely that it was Powers.\nPhoenix:\n(There's got to be more to this. I'd better keep pressing her.)Maya:\nWell, Nick? Find any glaring contradictions?Phoenix:\nWell, she seems pretty sure that was Powers in that photo... I guess I'll just press her and see if I can shake her conviction...After pressing second or third statement, then pressing fourth statement:Edgeworth:\nI think we've heard enough! Haven't we, Your Honor?Judge:\nWell, there is one thing that bothers me.Edgeworth:\nWhich is?Judge:\nWhere is this \"Steel Samurai\" costume now?Edgeworth:\nUmm... hmm. Actually, well... We couldn't find it. We're looking, though.Judge:\nHmm...Edgeworth:\nAnyway, that's not important! The witness did see the Steel Samurai, yes. And it is clear that the person in the Steel Samurai suit was Mr. Will Powers!Judge:\nHmm... I suppose that's right.Phoenix:\n(Are you sure you're sure, Your Honor?)Object\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHold it right there! We keep talking possibilities, but we have to agree that this photo shows the Steel Samurai! Nowhere in this photo can we see Mr. Will Powers!\nJudge:\nHmm... The defense has a point. I also wonder if someone else not caught on camera could have killed Mr. Hammer. We have to consider that possibility, also.\nEdgeworth:\nThen allow me to remove that doubt from your mind, Your Honor...\nLeads to:\n\"Will the witness continue her testimony, please?\"Wait and see what happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I think I'll wait and see where this goes.)\nJudge:\nI suppose, since there weren't any additional crew members at the studios that day... It's quite likely that it was the defendant inside that costume. I see no problem with this evidence.\nEdgeworth:\nMost perceptive, Your Honor!\nPhoenix:\n(He still doesn't seem that convinced to me... I hope.)\nLeads to:\n\"Will the witness continue her testimony, please?\"Edgeworth:\nWill the witness continue her testimony, please?Oldbag:\nNo need to ask twice!Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account, cont. --Oldbag:\nThe time of poor Hammer's death was 2:30 PM, true?\nThe only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers!\nNo one else went there!\nIf they had, I would have seen them!Judge:\nHmm... So, if no one else went to the studio... Then it would have to be this \"Steel Samurai\" who did it. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Cross Examination-- Witness's Account, cont. --Oldbag:\nThe time of poor Hammer's death was 2:30 PM, true?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow do you know that?\nOldbag:\nEh? Didn't I just explain? I gave donuts to the young detective. And the, after some rubbish about it being a \"secret, pal\" he told me everything.\nPhoenix:\n(I see Detective Gumshoe shares his fellow officer's fondness for donuts.)Oldbag:\nThe only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely sure!?\nOldbag:\nOh, quite, quite, sonny.

Or, for that matter, entirely forgetting them.Maya:\nHow convenient.Phoenix:\n(Something for you to look forward to, perhaps?)Phoenix:\nHold on! Look at this photograph one more time. This photo was taken by the camera at the gate for the studios, correct?Oldbag:\nYesiree, sonny.Phoenix:\nSo, whenever anyone passes by here, it automatically takes a picture?Oldbag:\nAnd here I thought you didn't know your head from a hole in the ground.Phoenix:\nRight... Anyway! It's also true that the computer in the guard station records all security cam data.Oldbag:\nOoh! You know, if you wanted to work at the studio, we might have an opening.Phoenix:\nThat very computer printed out this photo. Note that on the back of the photo are printed the words: [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2]Oldbag:\nEven I know that means it was taken at 2:00 PM on October the 15th! Really, sonny!Phoenix:\nActually, I knew that too. The issure here is the bit at the end where it says: \"Photo #2\"...Oldbag:\n\"Photo #2\"...?Phoenix:\nThe computer only held data for one photo on that day. Don't you think that's odd? Shouldn't this photo be \"Photo #1\" if it really was the ONLY photo!?Judge:\nOrder! Order! Please tell the court what you mean by this, Mr. Wright!Phoenix:\nActually, that's what I want to ask the witness. This evidence shows that not one, but two people went to the studio that day. Yet there is only data for one of the photos! Who could have erased the data for the other photo? Only someone with access-- the security lady herself! (Changed from [Only someone with access... the security lady herself!] in the original release)Oldbag:\nEh!? You watch your mouth, whippersnapper! The only person I saw that day was Will Powers!Phoenix:\nBut the camera on the gate fired twice! That means two people went by!Oldbag:\nUmm... well, yes... that's what it would seem to mean...Judge:\nCan the witness explain this to the court?Oldbag:\nUmm... ahem. I-I don't understand these new-fangled computer things... Umm... E-Edgey-boy! Help!Edgeworth:\nHuh!? B-believe me, I want to, but I don't know what this means either.Oldbag:\nHumph! Some help you are! You're a whippersnapper too! ... ... Whippersnapper...?Judge:\nSomething the matter, Ms. Oldbag?Oldbag:\nAh! That's right! I... I just remembered something!Judge:\nLet me guess...

I check all the people that passed by the main gate that day. I look closely at every one of the photos that security camera takes.\nEdgeworth:\nDo you backup all of the security camera data?\nOldbag:\nWell, they keep telling me too, yes. But those computers are just so frustrating.Oldbag:\nI go through the photos recorded on the security computer and check them.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow many photos are there, usually?\nOldbag:\nOn a day when we're open to the public, we get more than 500 people. But on filming days or rehearsal days... well, we don't have much money. We never get more than 50, and that's a big day.\nEdgeworth:\nDo you backup all of the security camera data?\nOldbag:\nWell, they keep telling me too, yes. But those computers are just so frustrating.Oldbag:\nI throw out any photos that aren't suspicious lookin', you see.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow exactly do you determine what isn't \"suspicious lookin'\"?\nOldbag:\nOh, you can tell by looking at their faces. For the most part.\nPhoenix:\nF-for the most part? This is a murder trial, Ms. Oldbag!\nOldbag:\nWell, I didn't touch that suspicious lookin' Will Powers's photo, did I?\nPhoenix:\n(I think she's missing the point.)Oldbag:\nCome to think of it, now I remember throwing out one photo that day!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Well, who in the heck was in that photo you erased!?\"Maya:\n\"Come to think of it\"? Couldn't she think of that a little earlier!?Phoenix:\nClassic old windbag maneuver, Maya.Maya:\nHmm... Might be a useful tactic to remember for use in my future career as a windbag.Phoenix:\n(Let's find out more about this \"erased\" photo.)Phoenix:\nWell, who in the heck was in that photo you erased!?Oldbag:\nHumph. A fanboy.Phoenix:\nF-fanboy?Oldbag:\nSteel Samurai fanboys. Real freaks, if you ask me. They get information about the rehearsals from gosh-knows-where. They're always hanging about. One was there that day.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nW-wait a second! Didn't you just say no one else could get in!? \"I locked the main gate so no one could get in\"... Those were your words!Oldbag:\nWell! If you must know, there's a drain that goes into the Employee Area. The grate has been loose for a while. It leads outside, and well, that's where they come in.Phoenix:\nThey come in through the drain?Oldbag:\nI told you they were freaks. Oh, and...Phoenix:\nAnd...?Oldbag:\nThey're kids. Children. Whippersnappers.Phoenix:\nK-kids!? So, on the photo that you erased...?Oldbag:\nIt was a boy. Probably 2nd or 3rd grade.Phoenix:\nWhaaaaaaaaaaaat!?Judge:\nO-order! Order! Let me get this straight. You saw two people pass by the gate on their way to the studios that day? One was the Steel Samurai, dragging his leg. The other was a boy who looked to be in about 2nd or 3rd grade?Oldbag:\nOh yes, well we see his type there every day. Can't stop 'em. Can't catch 'em.Edgeworth:\nA boy in 2nd or 3rd grade? Hmm... I assume it would be hard, if not impossible for a young boy to wield the Samurai Spear?Judge:\nImpossible, I'd think. It's quite heavy.Oldbag:\nRight! As I said, I didn't pay him much mind. That's why I erased the data.Maya:\nUm, Nick? What's going on? I mean, the boy was there, that makes him a suspect!Phoenix:\nYeah, and they're already trying to \"un-suspect\" him.Judge:\nThis court will take a five-minute recess. (Changed from [I'd like to take a five minute recess.] in the original release) I want the defense and the prosecution to consider this new information... And no forgetting vital information this time!October 18, 11:08 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3Phoenix:\nMr. WP?Will:\nY-yes?Phoenix:\nTell me straight: were you really in your dressing room? You didn't go to the studio?Will:\nI-I didn't go to the studio! I was s-sleeping, honest.Maya:\nSo who was the \"Steel Samurai\" in that security photo?Will:\nHow should I know? The Steel Samurai costume was off in the corner of the dressing room. Anyone could have walked in and taken it, really.Maya:\nWhat!? You should take better care of that stuff!Will:\nI couldn't imagine anyone would want to steal a Steel Samurai costume! So... where does this leave me?Phoenix:\nIt doesn't look good...Will:\n*sniff*Phoenix:\nYou're the only likely suspect, right now.Maya:\nNick! W-what are we going to do!?Phoenix:\nFirst, we play for more time. We'll start targeting someone else that could conceivably have done this!Maya:\nRight! And it'll take them so long to shoot us down that we can get another day!Phoenix:\nRight... but if we pick the wrong person, we might lose on the spot.Will:\nYou... don't sound very optimistic.Phoenix:\nI'm not optimistic at all, actually.Maya:\nHey, Nick. It's time.Phoenix:\nOkay. Let's go. *sigh*Will:\nWhat does that mean... Please don't sigh like that! *sniff*Judge:\nCourt will now reconvene for the trial of Mr. Will Powers. (Changed from [The court will now reconvene for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.] in the original release) Mr. Edgeworth, will you present the prosecution's thoughts on this matter?Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution's thoughts are simple. Nothing has changed. The other person who went to the studios was a boy of roughly 10 years of age. The photo we do have may not be hard evidence... But there is still no one else that could have committed this crime! I call for a verdict of \"guilty\" for the defendant, Mr. Will Powers!Judge:\nHmm... Very well. Mr. Wright, your thoughts?Phoenix:\nThe defense disagrees with the prosecution's claim. There IS another person who could have committed this crime!Judge:\nOrder! Interesting... Let us hear who you have in mind! However... Be aware that this court does not look kindly on accusing the innocent. If you accuse someone who is obviously innocent, you will be penalized.Phoenix:\n(Right. Great. As if the stakes weren't high enough.)Judge:\nSo, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder?The assistant girl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt was the assistant! The Steel Samurai costume was in his dressing room. She stole it, and in doing so she became the Steel Samurai!\nJudge:\nSo you're saying the Steel Samurai in the picture is really the assistant?\nPhoenix:\nThat's correct, Your Honor!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nIf you're serious, you've got guts, Mr. Wright. Remember the photo? Wasn't the Steel Samurai a little lame!? He was dragging his foot!\nPhoenix:\nOh. (Uh oh. Bad feeling time.)\nEdgeworth:\nRemember the testimony concerning Powers's injury!!!\n\n\nOldbag:\nPowers and poor Hammer were at the run-through. Oh, and me.\nPhoenix:\nWhat about the assistant?\nOldbag:\nOh, her? She was cleaning up backdrops, I think. She didn't know about Powers's ankle.\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe assistant knew nothing of Mr. Power's injury! She could look the Steel Samurai look with that costume... But she couldn't walk the the Steel Samurai walk! She wouldn't have limped!\nPhoenix:\nUngh!\nMaya:\nThat kind of takes the legs out from under that case...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. I'm afraid I have to penalize you, as I warned.\nPhoenix:\n(Nobody knows... the trouble I've seen...)\nJudge:\nMay we move on, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(Grr... this fight isn't over yet!) If you would, Your Honor, one more chance, please.\nJudge:\nVery well. Go ahead.\nLeads back to:\n\"So, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder?\"The grade-school boy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt was the grade-school boy! ... ... ... Why isn't anyone saying anything?\nEdgeworth:\nBah! Are you seriously suggesting the boy did it, Mr. Wright!? \"Grade-school boy kills veteran action star with spear!\" For one thing, it was the Steel Samurai holding the murder weapon. Would you care to explain just how the boy was involved?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... maybe that was a dumb move on my part.)\nMaya:\n\"Maybe\"? \"Maybe\"!? How about \"absolutely,\" Nick!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. I'm afraid I have to penalize you, as I warned.\nPhoenix:\n(Nobody knows... the trouble I've seen...)\nJudge:\nMay we move on, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(Grr... this fight isn't over yet!) If you would, Your Honor, one more chance, please.\nJudge:\nVery well. Go ahead.\nLeads back to:\n\"So, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder?\"The security lady\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"It was the security lady! Wendy Oldbag!\"Phoenix:\nIt was the security lady! Wendy Oldbag!Oldbag:\nW-who!?Phoenix:\nThe Steel Samurai is dragging his leg in this picture. That means whoever was in the suit knew about that morning's injury. Maybe because... they had been watching the action scene run-through! There was only one person other than Powers and Hammer who knew about the injury. The security lady, Oldbag!Oldbag:\nW-what!? Whippersnapper!Judge:\nOrder! Order! I-is this true, Oldbag!?Oldbag:\nOldbag!? That's Ms. Oldbag to you!Phoenix:\nMs. Oldbag was standing guard alone at the main gate. She was by herself... in other words, she has no alibi! She could have briefly left her post to steal the the Steel Samurai costume... Then slipped into Studio One, the scene of the murder!Judge:\nW-why would she go through the trouble of wearing the Steel Samurai costume!?Phoenix:\nSimple, Your Honor. She knew the camera at the gate would take her picture. If she was in his costume, she could point the finger at Mr. Powers!Judge:\nI see! Excellent deductive reasoning, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\n(Ohhh yeah, right here! Sherlock Holmes II, baby!) ...? (That's odd. Isn't this the part where Edgeworth pounces...? Doesn't he usually jump up with an objection and some new damning evidence...?)Judge:\nWell, Mr. Edgeworth? Does the prosecution have an opinion on this matter?Edgeworth:\n... The prosecution has no meaningful objections at this time.Oldbag:\nW-w-what!? What's that supposed to mean!? Oh, so you all think I did it? Is that it!? Edgey-boy! Don't just sit there, do something!Phoenix:\n(What's my move? Maybe now's my chance to take this the whole way?)Press further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case...\"Give granny a break\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I guess this does kind of make it look like she's the killer. Funny, I feel bad for her all of a sudden.)\nJudge:\nHmm... It's true that the witness could conceivably have committed this crime. Yet we must not forget that the victim was an action hero. As formidable as her personality may be, I doubt she'd be strong enough.\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh! If he removes her from consideration, that means Mr. Powers is it! Sorry, windbag... but I don't have a choice.)\nLeads to:\n\"The very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case...\"Phoenix:\nThe very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case... can be used to cast doubt on Ms. Oldbag's actions on that day!Oldbag:\nB-but why would I do something so horrible to poor Hammer!?Phoenix:\nYou forget that Mr. Powers lacks a clear motive, too.Judge:\nHmm... Indeed.Phoenix:\n(That did it. Now windbag is one of the suspects. No hard feelings... I hope.)Oldbag:\nWait just a minute! What about the other person who went to the studio!? The boy! The one whose photo I erased!Judge:\nHe's only a grade schooler though, as you said. 2nd or 3rd grade, was it?Oldbag:\nTh-that doesn't matter! When I was that age, I could pin my old man in 10 seconds, tops!Judge:\nHmm... Your thoughts, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nThat boy is not the killer.Oldbag:\nWhat!? How can you be so sure! Oh, or is it be nice to the kids and mean to your elders day? Whippersnapper!Phoenix:\nI have proof.Oldbag:\nP-proof!?Judge:\nIndeed? Then let's see this proof, Mr. Wright. You have proof that shows the boy could not have committed this murder?Present Cardkey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe scene of the murder, as we all know, was Studio One. However, you need a cardkey to enter Studio One! How could a boy with no formal relation to the studios have a cardkey!?\nLeads to:\n\"I see!\"Present Powers's(?) Photo or Samurai Spear\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! The murder weapon was the Samurai Spear. That very spear is shown here in this photo. How could the boy have taken the spear? It's impossible!\nLeads to:\n\"I see!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThis is my proof!\nJudge:\n... I can't see how that has anything to do with this matter, Mr. Wright? Mr. Wright. There aren't that many pieces of evidence in the Court Record. Please try not to pick the wrong ones!\nPhoenix:\nS-sorry, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nI'll ask again, Mr. Wright.\nLeads back to:\n\"You have proof that shows the boy could not have committed this murder?\"Judge:\nI see!

Yet, as we stand here, they have not been questioned! I hold that it is impossible to declare a verdict on the defendant, Mr. Powers!Judge:\nHmm... The court acknowledges the defense's point.

It was down that path with the fallen tree, right?Phoenix:\nYeah, I think that's what they said.Maya:\nMaybe the director and the rest of them are there today? Now's our chance, Nick! Let's check it out!Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBench\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI'm bushed.

The monkey head is in the way, but we should be able to get by it without a problem.\nMaya:\nThis monkey head is real heavy!\nPhoenix:\nWell, it did knock that tree over when it fell.\nMaya:\nBoth of these, the monkey head and the tree, fell the day of the murder, didn't they.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, that's what Detective Gumshoe said.\n\n\n\n\nStatue with broken head\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe studio mascot. Apparently it's a monkey of some kind. I've never seen a monkey with a nose like that before!\nMaya:\nWhy don't they put his head back on? Maybe we should ask that assistant?\nPhoenix:\nI'm not sure we really want her fixing anything. And you'd probably need a crane to move that thing.\nMaya:\nProbably so.\n\n\n\n\nSecurity camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThat's the security camera that automatically takes pictures of people here.

Or maybe the Steel Samurai!\nPhoenix:\n(I think she's being serious...!)\n\n\n\n\nStage backdrop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nLooks like a backdrop for a stage.

Great job, guys!Phoenix:\nOh? Oh hoh hoh. Don't mention it.Penny:\nIs it true they caught the security lady!?Phoenix:\nOh! Oh... oh hoh hoh!Penny:\nActually, she just called me. She told me to cover up that drain...Phoenix:\nYou mean that one? (Wow, what a mess...)Penny:\nI... I know... I'm not so good with handiwork. Some assistant, right?Maya:\nYeah, but you do work on the props, and the backdrops, right?Penny:\nR-right. Just... lots of times they end up looking worse than they did before I fixed them.Maya:\nOh? Oh! Well, I'm sure these things happen. Nothing to worry yourself about!Penny:\nYou're right! I won't!Phoenix:\n(Personally, I think she should worry at least a little bit more...)Penny:\nUm, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to the guard station.

He came in through that drain?\nPhoenix:\nSo it seems. I guess they covered it up in a hurry.\nMaya:\nHey... Hey, Nick! If that drain's covered, the boy won't be able to get in.\nPhoenix:\nUh, yeah. I think that was the idea...?\nMaya:\nI feel kinda sorry for him, though. Don't you?\nPhoenix:\nWhat, you want to rip the grate off?\nMaya:\nReally, Nick? We can!?\nPhoenix:\n(Whoa... she's serious? Uh oh...)\n\n\n\nRip it open\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, I guess some things are just made to be broken.\nMaya:\nYay!

That should make the kids happy.\nPhoenix:\nThe things we do...\nLeads back to examination\n\n\n\n\nLeave it be\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nNah, I think we should leave it on. They only just repaired it. And if we take it off, that assistant will get yelled at by you-know-who.\nMaya:\nYeah... I guess so.\nPhoenix:\n(Wow!

Oh, too bad, it's sold out.October 18Global StudiosDressing RoomMaya:\nThis is where the Steel Samurai costume was, on the day of the murder.Phoenix:\nThat's what Mr. Powers says, at least.

(She's got a point!)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCosmetics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere's an array of cosmetics here.

Those must be Mr. Powers's personal clothes.\n\n\n\n\nCouch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nLooks like someone was sleeping here. Maybe Powers did take a nap here, like he said.\n\n\n\n\nBag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nMr. Powers's bag. I wonder what's inside? Hey! Supermarket tabloids? Wow. I'm kind of shocked.\nPhoenix:\nMaya!

You look a little out of place.Penny:\nIt's the clothes, isn't it? I thought my camo vest might do the trick... Kind of an \"alternative guard fashion\" thing.Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuard station\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe security guard station.

They won't even let me clean up. Don't want me \"disturbing evidence.\" I haven't even cleaned up our lunch plates from the day of the murder!\nPhoenix:\nYou mean those plates with the steak bones left over on them in the employee area?\nPenny:\nYeah. Can you believe it?\n\n\n\n\nThe fanboy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nDo kids sneak in here a lot?\nPenny:\nWell... I don't think there's that many of them, but I do see one in particular a bunch. He's always gawking at the sets, or snapping pictures. You should see Old Windbag's eyes flash when she sees him. She has a bit of trouble catching him though...\n\n\n\n\nThe director, et al.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI heard something at the trial today. They said that the director and producer were here the day of the murder...\nPenny:\nOh, sorry... I was in the prop storage room, so I didn't see them. I guess they were here, though. The studio head seemed pretty eager to keep us quiet.\nMaya:\nSo they were trying to protect the director?\nPenny:\nMore the producer, really. The producer's our real star here. She saved these studios from the brink of disaster and kept them running. I don't think we'd still be in business if it weren't for that producer!\nPhoenix:\n(The producer, huh?)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCardkey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenny:\nWow, they gave a lawyer one of those cardkeys?\nPhoenix:\nWell, I'm sort of borrowing it.\nPenny:\nI see. You better be careful not to lose that. They're very strict about those cardkeys here.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess they're pretty good about keeping these out of outsider's hands.) Thanks, I'll be careful.\n\n\n\n\nPowers's(?) Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nCould you take a look at this?\nPenny:\nThat's Mr. Powers. Why is he dragging his leg like that?

Never mind.\n\n\n\n\nSamurai Spear\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSay, you work with the props, right? About that murder weapon...\nPenny:\nYou mean the Samurai Spear? Yeah, it's a prop, but it's still pretty heavy. I hate having to carry that thing around.\nPhoenix:\n(So you'd have to be pretty strong to use that as a weapon, it sounds like. Why is Mr. Powers the only person I can think of!?)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenny:\nUmm... Not really sure what that is.

That security lady told j00 about us, eh?\nPhoenix:\nThat's right.\nManella:\nIt was a pretty regular day. We had a run-through for an action scene in the morning.

With the producer, and some bigwigs from the network.\nPhoenix:\n(Mr. Hammer's time of death was estimated at 2:30 PM.

She's a genius. M4d sk1llz, all the way. Scary, though. *sweats* She brought these studios back from the brink of destruction. She's the one who made it possible for me to make the Steel Samurai!\nPhoenix:\nYou had a meeting with her on the day of the murder, right?\nManella:\nYeah, we were together from noon to 4:00 PM, the whole time.\n\n\n\n\nThe bigwigs (appears after \"The day of the crime\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWho exactly are these \"bigwigs\" people keep mentioning?\nManella:\nOh, the boss over at the network, and some sponsors. Also a few production guys. They piled into a limousine and got here right around noon. Major tension! *sweats*\nPhoenix:\nWere all of them with you the entire time?\nManella:\nYeah, unfortunately.

Anything you could tell us would be a big help.\nVasquez:\n... You know there was a meeting here at noon?\nPhoenix:\nYes. With the director and the people from the network...\nVasquez:\nCorrect. Now, listen closely. None of the people in this trailer that afternoon went to Studio One. It was impossible for us to leave.\nMaya:\nImpossible? Why?\nVasquez:\nThe path was blocked.\nPhoenix:\nThe... path?Phoenix:\nOn the day of the murder, the path that leads here was blocked?Vasquez:\nYou saw Mr. Monkey on the way here, correct?Phoenix:\nM-\"Mr. Monkey\"?Vasquez:\nThe monkey with the broken head.Phoenix:\nOh, right, that... (What an original name...)Vasquez:\nIts head fell over in the wind on the day of the murder. They didn't start moving the head out of the way until after 3:00. It was after 4:00 by the time the path was unblocked. Capice? Everyone in this trailer was stuck here until the path was cleared. Stuck in this trailer. Stuck until after 4:00. Hammer died at 2:30. Thus, none of us could have gone to Studio One.Maya:\nW-what!?Vasquez:\nIt's true. A crane came just after 3:00 to move the head. We called some people in to clear the way. I'm sure they'd corroborate my story.Phoenix:\nB-but wait! What if the head fell over after 2:30? Then you could have gone to Studio One!Vasquez:\n2:30... the time of death. ... Very well. Come.Outside Studio OneVasquez:\n... That's \"Mr. Monkey.\" When it wasn't broken, it announced the time... in \"ooks.\" One \"ook\" per hour. Ook ook ook ook.

Nick, it's stopped at 2:15.Phoenix:\n2:15...?Vasquez:\nThat's right. This path was blocked from 2:15 till after 4:00.

I'm surprised they don't have an extra large one for Mr. Manella.\n\n\n\n\nFilm camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA collection of expensive film equipment. I can't even begin to imagine how much just one of these costs. If we broke one, we'd go bankrupt for sure.\n\n\n\n\nReflecting screen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA panel for reflecting light. They call it a \"reflecting board\" or something.\n\n\n\n\nStage backdrop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA stage backdrop. This is \"Neo Fujiyama,\" according to Maya. It looks incredibly fake, but I guess the kids don't mind.\n\n\n\n\n(Step)ladder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA perfectly normal stepladder. I've never actually used one. I don't like heights. I'm a firm belever that humankind was made to keep both feet on the ground.Outside Studio TwoExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLunch table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nLooks like two people ate here. There's nothing left on the plates.\n\n\n\n\nNumber \"2\" sign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere's a big \"2\" painted here. Probably because this is Studio Two? Probably... Though it doesn't look anything like a studio.\n\n\n\n\nStudio van\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA light van for moving staff and equipment around. They've kept it in pretty good shape. Looks like it'd run fine.\n\n\n\n\nFlower garden\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nNameless flowers bloom in solitude. They probably have a proper name... But it is not for me to know. Not now, nor ever till the end of my days. ... I need a vacation.\n\n\n\n\nStorage materials\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThese look like materials for making a movie set. They've been sitting here for quite some time. This might as well be a junkyard.\n\n\n\n\nTrailer door\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe door is unlocked.

Chopping off heads?\nMia:\nIt's a samurai musical set in ancient Japan.\nPhoenix:\nA s-samurai musical? Is that even a genre!? Well, I'm impressed. You know your stuff, Mia.\nMia:\nOh, Maya's the real fan. I just picked a little up.\n\n\n\n\nMiddle poster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\"'Samurai Summer' starring Jack Hammer.\" This poster looks like it's been hanging here for years.\nMia:\nThis is one of Maya's favorite movies.\nPhoenix:\nMaybe we should replace the poster in the office with this one?\nMia:\nThat... would be kind of sad.October 18Global StudiosEmployee AreaPhoenix:\nHey!

It's not locked.\nMia:\nThis is where Cody ran... Let's go in and see if we can get him to talk.\n\n\n\n\nStorage room door\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThat must be the storage room. That's where they keep all the film equipment.\n\n\n\n\nVending machine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nLet's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks, or something. Popcorn, at least!\nMia:\nLook at this! \"Spaghetti in a Soda Can\"...?\nPhoenix:\nS-spaghetti? Wouldn't just the sauce come out and the noodles all stay stuck inside?\nMia:\n\"Best when slammed.\" I guess they want you to drink it in one gulp...?\nPhoenix:\nSlamming spaghetti.

He looks so tough, but inside, he's as gentle as a kitten!\nPhoenix:\nYeah...\nCody:\nSo, what else do you like about him?\nPhoenix:\n(Don't tell me I have to keep this act up...)\nLeads back to:\n\"So, tell me what your favorite thing about the Steel Samurai is!\"\n\n\n\n\nHis fighting skills\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Got to think of something...\"\n\n\n\n\nWill Powers's acting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nW-well... (I've never even seen a full episode of that dumb show.) A-actually, I'm kind of a fan of Will Powers...\nCody:\nWhoa! That's totally hard-core!\nPhoenix:\n(You're calling ME hard-core?)\nCody:\nSo, what else do you like about him?\nPhoenix:\n(Don't tell me I have to keep this act up...)\nLeads back to:\n\"So, tell me what your favorite thing about the Steel Samurai is!\"\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Got to think of something...) I like it when he, uh, he vanquishes his foes!\nCody:\nYeah! Whizzam! The Steel Samurai always wins! Always! Check this out! It's my fan album!\nPhoenix:\nWhat the...? It's all pictures of the Steel Samurai.\nCody:\nI go to every live performance!\nPhoenix:\n(Those stupid publicity stunts where they beat each other up in public...?)\nCody:\nI always take a picture when the Steel Samurai lands the final blow! Whizzam! I got 'em all! I never missed one! A perfect collection! Check it out! My new digital camera!\nMia:\nWow, that's very impressive. The newest model, isn't it?\nCody:\nYou bet, lady! I just got it for my birthday. My album has a name, wanna hear it? \"The Steel Samurai: Path To Glory.\" The Steel Samurai always wins! Always! Hey, if you want this, you can have it, lady.\nMia:\nReally? Are you sure?\nCody:\nYeah, I took these with a digital camera. I got all the data at home so I can always make another one.\nMia:\nWell, then I'm happy to accept! Thank you.\n\"Path to Glory\" received.\nPhoenix:\n(What's with people always giving stuff to Mia? What a life!)\nMia:\n?\n\n\n\n\nThe Steel Samurai (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo... you like the Steel Samurai.\nCody:\nWell, yeah! Duh! He's so strong!\nPhoenix:\nI... I guess.\nCody:\nYou're judging him by his looks! You have to look at his actions, at his life!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm being lectured on life by a grade schooler...)\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYou were here on the day of the... incident, right?\nCody:\nYeah...\nPhoenix:\nDid you see anything unusual?\nCody:\n...\nMia:\nCody.\nCody:\n!\nMia:\nCody, he needs to know because he's fighting for justice. Isn't that the Steel Samurai's motto? \"For great justice\"? You have to help us fight for great justice, too.\nCody:\nI... I saw... I saw everything!\nPhoenix:\n(Well, well... We might get some useful information out of him yet.)\n\n\n\n\nWhat you saw (appears after \"The Steel Samurai\" and \"What happened\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Cody...

No looking at that, okay!\nPhoenix:\n(Believe me, I wasn't going to...)Phoenix:\nCody... I need to ask you something very important. What did you see on the day of the incident?Cody:\n... I got here that day around 2:00... I had to come in through the woods out back so that old lady wouldn't see me. I got kinda lost, though. I was in there for maybe a half hour or so. Then I finally got to the studio. After that...Mia:\nWhat is it, Cody?Cody:\nTh-the Steel Samurai killed the bad guy! He used his Samurai Spear! Just like always! One shot, one kill! It happened so fast... I got scared. I went home after that.Phoenix:\nI... I see. It must have been hard for you.Cody:\nMan, you say those nice things but it's so obvious you aren't speaking from the heart.Phoenix:\n(Umm... right.) Mia?Mia:\nYes?Phoenix:\nI think we can say for sure this means the Steel Samurai did it.Mia:\nTrue enough.Phoenix:\nAnd the director has an alibi, so it wasn't him.Mia:\nIndeed.Phoenix:\nSo... the only person left who it could have been is Will Powers!Mia:\n... I have to admit, it's kind of a shock. But if you put this boy on the witness stand, your client will be \"guilty\" for sure.Phoenix:\nLet's not call him then...Mia:\nI think that would be wise. Best to leave this one alone.???:\nNot so fast, pal!Gumshoe:\nI heard everything! This boy here's a key witness! And he's under police protection, starting now! C'mon, son. You've got a rendezvous with me down at the precinct!Cody:\nNo! I ain't going! Waah!Mia:\n... That didn't go so well. We're back to zero leads. And now we have a serious handicap in court.Phoenix:\nW-what're we going to do, Mia!Mia:\nWell, hmm... I... really need to be going. Don't worry, Phoenix. I'm sure you'll be fine!Phoenix:\nWhoa whoa whoa! C-come to the trial tomorrow, please! I need you there!Mia:\nPhoenix, can I ask you something? Do you really believe that Mr. Powers is innocent?I believe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOf course he is!\nMia:\n... That's all I wanted to hear. Excellent. I'll see you in court, then.\nLeads to:\n\"Great! Thanks, Mia!\"I don't know\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I never expected things to go this badly for Powers's case... I'm not sure we can win this one.)\nMia:\nPhoenix? If you don't believe him, who will!?\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh, she's mad.)\nMia:\nOh well... I'll see you in court tomorrow then.\nLeads to:\n\"Great!

Umm... Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nYes?Will:\nWhy do you look so... unhappy?Phoenix:\nO-oh! Oh, nothing! Eh heh heh. Really, it's nothing. Right, Mia? (Uh oh. She looks even unhappier...)Mia:\nPhoenix. Your client is now practically a dead man walking... Perhaps that's why I feel particularly close to him.Phoenix:\nThis is no time for dead-people jokes, please.Mia:\nYou know we're going into this trial utterly defenseless. Yet, if Mr. Powers is truly innocent... We should be able to find something overlooked in the evidence to prove it.Phoenix:\nSomething \"overlooked\"...?Mia:\nWe have to find something, Phoenix, today. It's that, or lose the trial.Phoenix:\n(This isn't going to be easy.)October 19, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:\nThe court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:\nVery well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth:\nAn unexpected fact has come to the attention of the court. Yesterday, we learned that there were other people present at the studios. Today, I would like to show evidence proving they had nothing to do with the murder.Judge:\nVery well. You may call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth.Phoenix:\n(I wonder if it'll be that producer...) (Changed from [I wonder if that producer is going to come out...] in the original release)Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution calls Mr. Sal Manella to the stand.Phoenix:\n(...or that director.)Edgeworth:\nWill the witness state his name and profession?Manella:\n... How r00d can j00 get! J00 don't know ME!? I'm the director! I make the Steel Samurai, n00b! ROFL!Edgeworth:\n...Manella:\nS... Sal Manella. I'm a director. Television.Judge:\nWere you at Global Studios on the day of the murder?Manella:\nY-yes, Your Honor.Judge:\nHmm... Very well. Please testify to the court about the events of that day.Mia:\nPhoenix. Let's start by picking this testimony apart. If Powers is innocent, you know what that means. Someone in the trailer on that day did it!Phoenix:\nR-right. (She doesn't waste any time putting on the pressure!)Witness Testimony-- The Day of the Murder --Manella:\nI was at the studios from around 9:00 that morning.\nDuring the morning, I was doing... umm... an action scene run-through.\nIt took a lot more time than I thought it would.\nI hear that everyone else ate lunch in the Employee Area...\nBut I had a meeting in the Studio Two trailer, so I ended up skipping lunch.\nWe were in the meeting until around 4:00...\nDuring the meeting, well, I'm pretty sure no one left their chairs.\nThat's about it.Judge:\nHmm... The time of Mr. Hammer's death was 2:30 PM. And according to your testimony, you were in a meeting at that time. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.Cross Examination-- The Day of the Murder --Manella:\nI was at the studios from around 9:00 that morning.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nIs that when you always come in to work?\nManella:\nOh, oh no. I come in all sort of hours. It's the \"industry\" way.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, I know all about the freaks in your \"industry\"...)\nManella:\nStill, FWIW, I was pretty busy all that day.\u00a0:(\nEdgeworth:\nTell us more about that.Manella:\nDuring the morning, I was doing... umm... an action scene run-through.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nIn the Employee Area?\nManella:\nThat's right. It was a fight scene between the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate.\nPhoenix:\nWas anyone else at the run-through?\nManella:\nOh, yeah. That security lady was sitting there watching the whole thing. LOL. She was cheering on Hammer, if you can believe it.\nPhoenix:\n(She certainly has the lungs for it...) Anyone else?\nManella:\nNope, just us four.Manella:\nIt took a lot more time than I thought it would.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy did it go on so long?\nManella:\nUm, I'm pretty sure j00've already heard about this... But WP twisted his ankle during the run-through, see...\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, right, thus the limp.)\nManella:\nWhich of course led to me missing my lunch. ROFS!\nPhoenix:\n(ROFS? Rolling on the Floor... Starving?)Manella:\nI hear that everyone else ate lunch in the Employee Area...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat exactly did they have for lunch?\nManella:\nT-bone steak! The assistant cooked some up.\nPhoenix:\n(Come to think of it, there was a plate with some bones on it in the Employee Area.)\nEdgeworth:\n\"Everyone else\" meaning that the witness did not eat with them.Manella:\nBut I had a meeting in the Studio Two trailer, so I ended up skipping lunch.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, in the end, you didn't get to eat?\nManella:\nYeah. No steak, at least! Can j00 believe it?\nPhoenix:\nThat must have been tough.\nMia:\nPhoenix.\nPhoenix:\nYeah?\nMia:\nDoesn't something about that seem odd to you?\n\n\n\nNot at all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, no, not really. Seems pretty straightforward.\nMia:\nOh. Perhaps I was wrong, then.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nIt's a little vague\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nActually, there is something bothering me. Mr. Manella, just now you said \"steak, at least.\" So you ate something other than steak?\nManella:\nYeah, good call! I had some chocolate in my pocket, which I used to stave off starvation!\nPhoenix:\nI see... (Is that all? I was sure I was on to something there.)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nIt's contradictory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYeah, it does seem odd, now that you mention it. Mr. Manella!\nManella:\nH-hmm? W-what do j00 mean? *sweats*\nPhoenix:\nWhen I went to Studio Two, I saw something on the table there. (Changed from [When I went to that trailer, I saw something on the table.] in the original release) There were two plates--the same kind of plates as the ones in the Employee Area. (Changed from [There were two plates on the table--the same kind of plates as in the Employee Area.] in the original release) Who ate lunch there?\nManella:\nM-mmpf! No, er, ah, um, eh heh. Good call! *sweats* I, er, I was embarrassed so I didn't mention it... But I did eat, after all.\nPhoenix:\nA t-bone steak, you mean?\nManella:\nYeah, well, I mean the assistant went through all that trouble... I brought it to the trailer thinking I could eat it later.\nPhoenix:\n(Clearly a man who likes to eat. I'd suspected as much...) So, when exactly did you eat it?\nManella:\nWe took one break during that meeting. I, er, wolfed it down then. *drool*\nPhoenix:\n(A mental image I will carry with me to my grave... Wait a second...! If they took a break in that meeting, that contradicts his testimony! I'll press on that one a bit more...)\nLeads back to cross-examinationManella:\nWe were in the meeting until around 4:00...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat were you discussing?\nManella:\nThe Steel Samurai story, and our budget. Get this! The sponsors turn to me and say, \"Mr. Manella. Those scripts of yours are not appropriate for children.\" Can j00 believe it!?\nPhoenix:\n(Actually, I kind of can.) So, nobody left the table during the whole meeting?Manella:\nDuring the meeting, well, I'm pretty sure no one left their chairs.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou didn't take a single break?\nManella:\nEr... well... Y-yeah! Not a one! *sweats*\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... what's he sweating so much about, I wonder? If only I had an idea... I'll wait for one to come up and hit him with it later.)Press (after selecting \"It's contradictory\" upon pressing fifth statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou didn't take a single break?\nManella:\nEr... well... Y-yeah! Not a one! *sweats*\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... what's he sweating so much about, I wonder? If only I had an idea... Wait a second... Maybe I do have an idea!)\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Wait a second!\"\n\n\n\n\nLeave him be\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, on second thought, I'm drawing a blank. If I press too hard in the wrong place, I'll just end up scaring him into silence. Maybe I'll just sit back and see what happens.)\nLeads back to cross-examinationMia:\nPhoenix. If his alibi holds, Powers is finished. Press him as hard as you can and find out where he's lying!Phoenix:\nR-right!Phoenix:\nWait a second! Mr. Manella, you've just contradicted yourself! Didn't you just tell the court that you ate that t-bone steak during a break?Manella:\nOops! ROFL!Phoenix:\nWell?Manella:\nUmm...Judge:\nMr. Manella, what's this all about?Manella:\nW-well, yeah, I guess we did take a little break.Mia:\nPhoenix! Great job! If they took a break, one of them could have gone to the studio during that time!Phoenix:\nYour Honor! I call on the witness to testify to the court about this break!Judge:\nVery well. Mr. Manella, your testimony, please.Manella:\nUrk!Edgeworth:\nHeh heh heh...Phoenix:\n(Uh oh. Edgeworth is laughing...)Witness Testimony-- The Break --Manella:\nYeah, FWIW, we took a break... ROFL!\nBut it was only 15 minutes! 15! That's only 13 in Base 12!\nNot enough time for someone to, say, commit murder in Studio One! LOL!\nThat's only just enough time to eat a t-bone steak, if you ask me! *steams*Judge:\nHmm... I don't think it would even be enough time for that, but that's just me. Very well. You may begin the cross-examination.Cross Examination-- The Break --Manella:\nYeah, FWIW, we took a break... ROFL!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat time exactly did you take this break?\nManella:\nHmm... I'd say it was from around 2:30 or so until 2:45.\nPhoenix:\n(2:30!!! That's the time of death! So he could have gone to Studio One, killed Hammer, and come back... I guess it's possible, time-wise...)\nEdgeworth:\n...Manella:\nBut it was only 15 minutes! 15! That's only 13 in Base 12!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat were you doing for those 15 minutes?\nManella:\nEating my t-bone steak! What else!?\nPhoenix:\nThere were two plates on the trailer table...?\nManella:\nOh, right. The other one was Diva's... sorry, Dee Vasquez's plate.\nPhoenix:\n(Dee Vasquez... the producer.)\nEdgeworth:\nTo eat a t-bone steak in 15 minutes... that's quite a feat.Manella:\nNot enough time for someone to, say, commit murder in Studio One! LOL!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy is that?Press (after pressing first statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Why is that?\"Manella:\nThat's only just enough time to eat a t-bone steak, if you ask me! *steams*Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nI have to say, you look like a guy who gets through his meals pretty fast.\nManella:\nWell, I was facing a cold, slightly chewy t-bone steak... Even I have to take my time eating that kind of food. LOLMia:\nWell, Phoenix?Phoenix:\nThat testimony was too short to wring any kind of useful information out of!Mia:\nAll you have to do is prove that he was able to go to Studio One in that time!Phoenix:\n(Oh, great. Is that all...)Phoenix:\nWhy is that?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nHaven't we had enough of this pointless line of questioning? Your Honor! The testimony to this point has made one certain fact painfully clear: The people in the trailer had nothing to do with this murder! It was impossible for any of them to go to Studio One!Phoenix:\nWhat!?Edgeworth:\nSomething wrong, Mr. Wright? Surely you aren't suggesting one of the people in the trailer went to Studio One!Judge:\nHmm... Well, Mr. Wright?Mia:\nPhoenix, this is critical! Think about it before you give your answer!Judge:\nDo you claim someone from the trailer went to Studio One?I claim it, and claim it loud\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If I agree to let everyone in that trailer off the hook then the trial is over... Mr. Powers will be found guilty for sure!) The victim was murdered at 2:30, the exact time of the break in the meeting. With 15 minutes, murder is certainly a possibility!\nJudge:\nHmm... I suppose you might say that...\nPhoenix:\n(Alright, I've got the judge thinking now!)\nEdgeworth:\nTsk, tsk, tsk... Never a dull moment with you, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nWhat's your point, Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nYou've been doing your homework, haven't you? Look at the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nThe Court Record...?\nEdgeworth:\nSurely, you knew that from 2:15 to 4:00 the path between the studios was blocked? Mrs. Monkey's head had fallen across the path!\nPhoenix:\nWhoa! You're right!\nEdgeworth:\nTrue, the break in the trailer meeting came right at the time of death... However! The path from there to the scene of the crime was blocked! The fallen Mrs. Monkey head barred the way!\nPhoenix:\n... (It's actually \"Mr. Monkey,\" but Edgeworth has a point... And somehow, I feel no desire to correct him.)\nJudge:\nNo counter-argument, Mr. Wright? Then I'm afraid you lose this round.\nLeads to:\n\"I believe we have seen enough evidence.\"No, it's impossible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I don't want to write off so many possible suspects... But I can't keep claiming the impossible, either...) I agree that it was impossible for anyone in the trailer to go to the studio in that time.\nEdgeworth:\nHa hah! I thought you might be thoughtlessly treading on thin ice again! But I see you had at least an inkling of the truth.\nJudge:\nWhat do you mean, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's quite simple... True, the break in the trailer meeting came right at the time of death... However! The path from there to the scene of the crime was blocked! The fallen Mrs. Monkey head barred the way! At around 2:15, a strong gust of wind knocked off the studio mascot's head. Ergo! When the people in the trailer took a break at 2:30, the way to the studio was blocked. Blocked... by Mrs. Monkey's severed head!\nPhoenix:\n... (It's actually \"Mr. Monkey,\" but Edgeworth has a point... And somehow, I feel no desire to correct him.)\nLeads to:\n\"I believe we have seen enough evidence.\"Edgeworth:\nI believe we have seen enough evidence. I would like to relieve Mr. Manella from the stand.Phoenix:\n(Wh-what? It's over?)Judge:\nVery well. The court's opinion on this case is as follows: We have found that there were several other people in Studio 2 on the day of the murder. However, it is also clear that none of these people could have gone to Studio One. They therefore have no relation to this case. Furthermore, with regards to the photo of the Steel Samurai... Given the size of the costume, no one other than Mr. Powers could have worn it that day. All that is lacking is decisive evidence that he is the one who did it. If we had that, I'm afraid I would have to find Mr. Powers guilty.Edgeworth:\nYour Honor. The prosecution is pleased to announce that we indeed have decisive evidence: a witness.Judge:\nWho is this witness, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nMy witness saw the very moment when the Steel Samurai skewered the victim!Judge:\nOrder! I will have order! I see. The court will take a 10 minute recess, after which we will hear your witness. Court is adjourned for recess!October 19, 11:04 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Mia:\n...Phoenix:\nWhat do we do now, Mia? If everyone in that trailer has an alibi...Mia:\n... I'm sorry, Phoenix. I guess I was wrong.Phoenix:\nM-Mia! Don't tell me you're giving up! If you give up, what hope do I have...?Mia:\n... Don't get me wrong. I've never given up on a trial before, not while there was a chance. Only one thing became clear in your cross-examination. The people in the trailer could not have gone to Studio One. I thought there was more to it than that... But I was wrong. That's all there is.Will:\nUmm... Er... What's going to happen to me? It kinda seems like everyone in that courtroom thinks I did it... They think I'm a murderer!Mia:\nDon't worry, Mr. Powers. If you are innocent, we will prove it. I guarantee it. Leave it to us, and... be yourself. Be strong. You are the Steel Samurai, hero to children everywhere, after all.Will:\nI... You... Thanks. *sniff*Mia:\nOkay, Phoenix. This one's for the kids! Let's do it!October 19, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:\nCourt is back in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution has a concern. As our witness is a grade schooler of tender years, and this is a murder case... we worry that the defense might cause unnecessary trauma with his cruel questioning. (Changed from [We worry that the defense might cause unnecessary trauma with his cruel questioning!] in the original release)Phoenix:\n(Nice to see Edgeworth taking the moral high ground...)Edgeworth:\nHowever, we have no choice. The prosecution calls Cody Hackins to the stand.Edgeworth:\nYour Honor. Perhaps you could arrange a box for him to stand on?Judge:\nOh, r-right. Guard, please bring him a box. One of those donut crates should do.Edgeworth:\nWill the witness state his name and grade in school.Cody:\n...Edgeworth:\nWitness!Cody:\nWhat!? Just 'cause you're all grown-up don't mean you can push me around!Edgeworth:\nMrph...Mia:\nCody? Answer his question, okay?Cody:\nH-hey, it's you! The nice lady! I'm Cody Hackins. I'm in 2nd grade!Phoenix:\n(I get the feeling this is going to be a long, long day...)Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth. Please remember that you're speaking to a child. Try to be gentle.Edgeworth:\nM-mrrrrph! Witness! Er, I mean, Cody.Phoenix:\n(He's having trouble with this \"gentle\" thing.)Edgeworth:\nYou were present, er, you were at Global Studios on the day of the, er, incident?Cody:\nYou got a problem with that!?Edgeworth:\nPlease tell us what you saw that day.Cody:\nWhat, pops? You want me to tell you and gramps with the beard over there?Edgeworth:\nJust.. Mr. Edgeworth will be fine.Judge:\nI prefer \"bearded gentleman\" myself.Phoenix:\n(A very long day...)Judge:\nIncidentally, photographic equipment is strictly forbidden in this courtroom.Edgeworth:\nM-mpht! M-my apologies, Your Honor. He said he wouldn't testify if he couldn't bring it... I'd like special permission, if that's possible.Phoenix:\nWait, so you're saying you had to bargain terms with a kid... and you LOST?Cody:\nHey! I just got this new camera! Don't really know how to use it all that good yet! But I bring it with me wherever I go!Mia:\nPhoenix. I wonder if he had that camera on the day of the murder... You'd better make a note of it in the Court Record.Cody's Camera added to the Court Record.Judge:\nVery well, Cody. Please testify to the court about what you saw the day of the incident.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Cody:\nI wanted to see a Steel Samurai rehearsal, just once.\nI found a map on the Internet, and went to the studios that day.\nI went through the woods off the path, so that old lady wouldn't catch me.\nI was going for the studio.\nI got kinda lost on the way, though. For about 30 minutes.\nWhen I came out by the studio, there was the Steel Samurai!\nIt totally rocked! Right before my eyes, out came the bad guy!\nOf course, the Steel Samurai took him down! Pow!\nIf I had my camera with me, that woulda been the time for a shot, I tell you.\nAnyway, I couldn't get into the studio, so I went home.Judge:\nHmm... Very well. The defense may begin its cross-examination. But be gentle. Remember you're talking to a child. (Changed from [And, be gentle. Remember you're talking to a child.] in the original release)Cody:\n...Phoenix:\n(This kid is tougher than most adults we see in here, honestly...)Cross Examination-- Witness's Account --Cody:\nI wanted to see a Steel Samurai rehearsal, just once.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou really like the Steel Samurai, huh?\nCody:\nCourse I do! I've taped every show! And I go to all the live performances!\nPhoenix:\nThat's impressive. Have you been to the amusement park?\nCody:\nCourse! Duh! My Dad always takes me!\nPhoenix:\n(Poor, poor Dad...)Cody:\nI found a map on the Internet, and went to the studios that day.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWas that day the first time you'd been to the studio?\nCody:\nUh, actually I've been a couple of times. I never manage to get there on a rehearsal day! And that security lady's always yelling...\nEdgeworth:\nRight, right. Please continue.\nCody:\nChill, pops! I'm getting to it! How am I supposed to talk with you cuttin' me off all the time? Geez!\nEdgeworth:\n...Cody:\nI went through the woods, off the path, so that old lady wouldn't catch me.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Off the path\"...?\nCody:\nYeah, you know how the studios are in a valley there? If you go off the path a little, there's woods. That's where I was!\nPhoenix:\nI see.\nCody:\nAnyhow...Cody:\nI was going for the studio.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid nothing unusual happen on your way to the studio?\nCody:\n\"Unusual\"?\nPhoenix:\nDid you see this monkey by any chance?\nCody:\nOh, you mean Mr. Monkey? Yeah I saw him, but his head wasn't busted!\nEdgeworth:\nSo you went straight to the studio?Cody:\nI got kinda lost on the way, though. For about 30 minutes.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou got lost in the woods?\nCody:\nYeah. I couldn't figure out which way I was walking. Man, was I relieved when I saw the blue studio doors. But guess what happened next!Cody:\nWhen I came out by the studio, there was the Steel Samurai!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe Steel Samurai?\nCody:\nYeah, he was standing by the studio gate. It looked like he was thinking about something before going in. Then he opened up the gate and went inside.\nPhoenix:\nI see. What then?Cody:\nIt totally rocked! Right before my eyes, out came the bad guy!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat sort of \"bad guy\" was it?\nCody:\nA guy. A person. Kinda tall. Skinny.\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure it was a guy?\nCody:\n... I dunno. He was kinda far away.\nPhoenix:\n(Huh, he's being awfully vague...)\nMia:\n...Cody:\nOf course, the Steel Samurai took him down! Pow!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat happened to the bad guy?\nCody:\nHuh? Well... Well, he kinda didn't move. Not a bit. Like he was dead. I-I guess he's a real pro! What a great actor!\nPhoenix:\nY-yes, I suppose he was.Cody:\nIf I had my camera with me, that woulda been the time for a shot, I tell you.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"If\" you had your camera? You mean, you weren't carrying your camera then?\nCody:\nN-no, I wasn't. I-it's not like I have it all the time!\nPhoenix:\n(Really...?)Present Cody's Camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Cody, what you just said seems, well, a little strange.\"Phoenix:\n(I guess seeing the killing freaked him out and he went home...)Mia:\nPhoenix. Remember, he's a child. Use gentle words... but be firm.Phoenix:\n(Easy for you to say...)Phoenix:\nCody, what you just said seems, well, a little strange. Didn't you say before that you always bring your digital camera wherever you go? You were quite clear about that.Cody:\nHuh!?Phoenix:\nCody, you shouldn't lie here. You understand that, right?Judge:\nMr. Wright! A word with you...Phoenix:\n(Uh oh... was I putting the pressure on too much?)Judge:\nWhat is this \"digital\" camera contraption you're talking about?Phoenix:\nIt's umm... a digital camera, Your Honor. It's kind of a new sort of camera. (How do I explain that!?)Judge:\nI see.Phoenix:\nAnyway, Cody... I can't believe you wouldn't bring your camera on a trip to the studios! You did bring it, didn't you?Cody:\nUmm...Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nMr. Wright! How cruel you are, to terrorize a poor child so!Phoenix:\nI don't care if he's a child or a prosecuting attorney! No one should lie in court!Edgeworth:\nWhat do you mean \"or a prosecuting attorney\"!?Phoenix:\nWell, Cody?Cody:\nWh-what! Yeah, so I had my camera. So what!? You got a problem with that!?Judge:\nSo, you did have a camera? And did you use this camera?Cody:\nW-why would I use it? I... I was too busy watching.Judge:\nHmm... Very well. Please testify to the court about what you were so busy watching.Witness Testimony-- What I Saw --Cody:\nY-yeah, I had my camera with me.\nBut I was glued to the action! I couldn't take my eyes off it!\nThe Steel Samurai, he goes for the bad guy... wham!\nThen... then the bad guy stopped moving!\nHe's so strong! The Steel Samurai rules!Judge:\nHmm... Ah? Is that all? Well, that was brief. Mr. Wright, your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- What I Saw --Cody:\nY-yeah, I had my camera with me.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, why didn't you use it?\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nHe's getting to that! Relax and listen.\nCody:\nUmm... I didn't use it 'cause I was too busy watching the real thing!Cody:\nBut I was glued to the action! I couldn't take my eyes off it!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you were watching the Steel Samurai. Did you watch the whole fight?\nCody:\nY-yeah, of course!\nPhoenix:\nYou didn't turn away, not even once?\nCody:\nN... no!\nPhoenix:\nOkay, then tell us exactly what happened.\nCody:\nY-yeah! I'm getting to that!Cody:\nThe Steel Samurai, he goes for the bad guy... wham!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo the bad guy attacked him first?\nCody:\nYeah!\nPhoenix:\nWhat sort of person was this \"bad guy\"?\nCody:\nI told you, a person. He was a person.\nPhoenix:\nHow was he dressed?\nCody:\n... I kinda don't remember. I was too busy watching the Steel Samurai!\nEdgeworth:\nI see. And what happened next?Cody:\nThen... then the bad guy stopped moving!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy?\nCody:\nHuh? Whaddya mean, \"why\"?\nPhoenix:\nWhy wasn't the bad guy moving?\nCody:\nW-well 'cause the Steel Samurai brought him to justice!\nPhoenix:\nAnd how exactly did he do that?\nCody:\nH-how did he do it? With a Samurai Kick! And a Samurai Punch! Samurai Chop! ... Samurai Slap! S-something like that.\nPhoenix:\n(He's still being vague about this...)\nCody:\nWhat! Don't gimme that look, pops!\nPhoenix:\n(How should I play this?)\n\n\n\nWait and see what happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah... If I press too hard now, the judge might keep me from continuing. I'll sit back and see how the rest of this goes.)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress him harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Cody.\"Cody:\nHe's so strong! The Steel Samurai rules!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat did you do after the bad guy fell, Cody?\nCody:\n... Um, actually... The fight was so... so intense that I got kinda scared. So I went straight home.\nPhoenix:\n(Something isn't adding up here...)Phoenix:\n(Something about his account doesn't seem right...)Mia:\nPhoenix. It doesn't seem right because he's being deliberately vague! Press him on the facts, Phoenix! Find out what he saw!Phoenix:\nCody.Cody:\nWh-what!?Phoenix:\nSomething's bothering me. Before you said that you \"couldn't take your eyes off\" the action.Cody:\nY-yeah? So what?Phoenix:\nYet you missed the most important part!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nWhat is the meaning of this? The witness has stated what he saw quite clearly...Phoenix:Phoenix:\nYou know as well as I do that he's being vague! Tell me, what kind of murderer uses a \"Samurai Slap\"!?Edgeworth:\nM-mmph!Phoenix:\nMy point is this: Cody, you may have seen some of the Steel Samurai's fight... But you missed the most important part: the killing blow!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Mr. Wright! How could this be? Can you explain how he might have missed something so vital?Phoenix:\nUm, well... er, that's the thing...Mia:\nPhoenix! I believe you're on the right track with this! Think: why didn't Cody see the climax of the fight? I know you! You can figure this out!Judge:\nMr. Wright, your answer! We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai... Why wouldn't he watch the climax of the fight?He couldn't watch it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nBecause he couldn't watch it! How could he calmly watch a murder taking place at his age!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nJust a moment, please... One thing has become quite clear in this boy's testimony. He did not believe he was witnessing a murder! He was watching the Steel Samurai fight, like on TV. The more real the fight, the more he would have watched!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... huh.\nJudge:\nI have to agree with Mr. Edgeworth. Well, Mr. Wright. Do you have another explanation?\nLeads back to:\n\"We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai...\"He was watching something else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHe missed the climax of the fight... because he was looking at something else! Probably!\nEdgeworth:\n\"Probably\"?\nJudge:\n\"Something else\"?\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Wright, explain yourself! What could possibly distract this boy from seeing his idol, the Steel Samurai, fight!? What do you claim he was looking at?\nPhoenix:\nO-ooof! (C'mon, think of something... think of something... Nothing.)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Please refrain from making baseless claims!\nPhoenix:\nY-yes... Sorry, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nDo you have another explanation for this?\nLeads back to:\n\"We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai...\"Show evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor, I have evidence.\nJudge:\n\"Evidence\"...?\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. Why did Cody look away from the fight?\n\n\n\nPresent Cody's Camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Here's my proof!\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHere's my proof!\nJudge:\nProof?\nPhoenix:\nUm, uh... Can I... do that again? (This doesn't prove anything...!)\nEdgeworth:\nHah! Lost your nerve, have you?\nJudge:\nVery well... I'll ask you the question again.\nLeads back to:\n\"We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai...\"Phoenix:\nHere's my proof!Judge:\nWhat's that? The camera...?Phoenix:\nThe witness stated that he recently received this camera.Judge:\nYes, I'm aware of that.Phoenix:\nHe wasn't entirely familiar with its operation.Judge:\nI'm aware of that, too. Ah!Phoenix:\nCorrect! Why would Cody be looking somewhere else at the critical moment? Because he was looking at his camera! He was trying to take a picture!Cody:\nHey!Phoenix:\nBullseye!Cody:\nW-what's your problem, pops! You got a thing for picking on little kids!?Phoenix:\n(Pressing, not picking...)Mia:\nGood job, Phoenix! Cody was lying, clearly. Smart of you to realize there was no way he could just stand there, watching his hero... and not take a picture!Phoenix:\nRight! Cody? There was only one reason why you would have looked away from the fight. And that was because you wanted to take a picture. But having just received your camera, you weren't used to using it yet! So, you missed the climax of the fight. Correct?Cody:\n... ... ... Yeah.Mia:\nWell, Phoenix. I'll bet you anything he's hiding more than that. Have him testify again!Phoenix:\nR-right. (Mia means business!) Your Honor. The defense would like to request that Cody Hackins testify once more.Judge:\nV-very well. Cody? Could you please tell us about your camera... And about why you didn't take a picture of the fight?Cody:\nUmm...Phoenix:\n(Welcome to the real world, kid!)Witness Testimony-- No Photo? --Cody:\nYeah, you're right, pops.\nThe Steel Samurai had just escaped from the clutches of the villain.\nSo I held up my camera to take a picture!\nBut the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it.\nTh-that's all that happened. Yup.Judge:\nHmm... Anything strange in that testimony, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nI'm not sure... But I'd like to proceed with the cross-examination anyway.Cross Examination-- No Photo? --Cody:\nYeah, you're right, pops.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Pops\"...?\nCody:\nYeah, I called you \"pops,\" you spiky-haired geezer!\nPhoenix:\nG-geezer...?\nEdgeworth:\nI'm \"Mr. Edgeworth.\"\nJudge:\nAnd I guess I'm the \"bearded gentleman\"...\nCody:\nThat's what I hate about grown-ups. You're all so self-conscious!\nPhoenix:\nOkay, off with the kid gloves! Testify, witness, testify!\nCody:\nYipes!Cody:\nThe Steel Samurai had just escaped from the clutches of the villain.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you did see the beginning of the fight?\nCody:\nYeah.\nPhoenix:\nDid you notice anything unusual?\nCody:\nUmm... well... uh... I guess the Steel Samurai was moving a little strange...\nPhoenix:\n(Moving... strangely?)Cody:\nSo I held up my camera to take a picture!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy couldn't you take a picture?\nCody:\nMy new camera has too many buttons. I couldn't figure it out. I tried to take a picture, I really tried.Cody:\nBut the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhen the lens opened, what did you see?\nCody:\nUh... well, a person on the ground. And the Steel Samurai!Cody:\nTh-that's all that happened. Yup.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThat's all?\nCody:\nY-yeah! I told you, I didn't take a picture!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I would have, once I got that lens open... Did he really not take a picture? Not even one?)\n\n\n\nPress him hard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Nah, he definitely would have taken a picture. There's got to be something here I can use!) Cody! Listen up, Cody Hackins. I know exactly what happened that day. You took a picture!\nCody:\n... Hey!\nPhoenix:\n(Bullseye...?)\nCody:\nH-how did you know!?\nPhoenix:\nI see through all your lies Cody Hackins. It's one of my powers!\nCody:\nW-wow!\nPhoenix:\n(This feels great!)\nCody:\nY-yeah... Yeah, I took a picture.\nJudge:\nPerhaps you can change your testimony to reflect this, Cody?\nChanges statement from \"Th-that's all that happened. Yup.\" to \"I took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em.\"\n\n\n\n\nLet it slide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(He looks ready to burst into tears... I'd better lay off him for now.)\nLeads back to cross-examinationCody:\nI took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou \"erased\" them?\nCody:\nY-yeah!\nPhoenix:\nWhy would you erase a picture of your beloved Steel Samurai, victorious?\nCody:\nWell... y'know. W-why would I want to keep a picture like that?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... he's becoming less and less cooperative. I better find a clear contradiction soon... or some solid evidence.)Present \"Path to Glory\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Cody!\"Phoenix:\n(How can I pick holes in such a short testimony?)Mia:\nThere has to be something. Dig up the dirt, Phoenix! Find out what this kid's all about!Phoenix:\nCody!Cody:\nWh-wh-what!? Man, every time you say \"Cody\" you follow it with something bad.Phoenix:\nI just wanted to thank you for giving me this the other day.Cody:\nHuh? O-oh... right.Phoenix:\nWhat was it you told me then?Cody:\nI go to every live performance! I always take a picture when the Steel Samurai lands the final blow! Whizzam! I got 'em all! I never missed one! A perfect collection!Phoenix:\nCody. Did you really get a picture of the Steel Samurai standing victorious over his foe? If you did, I find it hard to believe that you would just erase it! Wouldn't you keep it for your album?Cody:\nAh!Judge:\nMr. Wright... What exactly is this album?Phoenix:\nIt's called \"Path to Glory.\" It's a collection of pictures of the Steel Samurai, all taken by Cody Hackins. He claims it's a perfect collection of every battle the Steel Samurai has won!Judge:\nI... I see.Phoenix:\nDon't you find this very odd, Your Honor? Among all his pictures of the Steel Samurai, none were taken that day!Judge:\nOrder! Mr. Wright. Have you an explanation? If the Steel Samurai had just defeated his adversary... I certainly would expect to see a picture of it in this album...Phoenix:\nExactly my point, Your Honor! ... ... .........! (No... wait... no way!)Mia:\nPhoenix? I think we've finally discovered the truth. And what a truth it is!Phoenix:\nM-Mia... are we sure about this? Did he actually...?Mia:\nYes. I'm pretty sure what you're thinking is right. Tell them, Phoenix. Tell them what the truth is.Judge:\nMr. Wright! Please explain to the court what is going on here! Why was there no picture in the album from the day of the murder? Why would the boy have erased the photos he took?The photos were blurry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI believe that Cody Hackins is what we call an \"artiste.\"\nJudge:\nAn... \"artiste\"...?\nPhoenix:\nHe didn't like the photos he had taken! They were blurry, or maybe his framing was off... Anyway, for some reason, he erased the data!\nJudge:\nIs that right, Cody?\nCody:\nWh-what do you mean \"framing was off\"!?\nJudge:\nIt seems the only thing \"off\" is your guesswork, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nUm, uh... Yes, well, I'm sure the real reason is...\nJudge:\nYes? The real reason is?\nLeads back to:\n\"Why was there no picture in the album from the day of the murder?\"He erased them by mistake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSimple, Your Honor. Cody wasn't used to using his new camera. He erased those photos he took by mistake!\nMia:\nW-wait a second, Phoenix. If that's your answer, we're back where we started!\nPhoenix:\nHuh? You mean, that wasn't it?\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! If you have something to say to the court, speak up!\nPhoenix:\nUm, well... S-sorry, Your Honor. Can I change my answer?\nJudge:\nHmm... *sigh*\nLeads back to:\n\"Why was there no picture in the album from the day of the murder?\"The Steel Samurai didn't win\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"I can think of only one reason, Your Honor.\"Phoenix:\nI can think of only one reason, Your Honor. The Steel Samurai didn't win! That's why Cody deleted those photos.Judge:\nYou mean the Steel Samurai... lost?Phoenix:\nWell, Cody? I'm right, aren't I? Tell the truth. The bad guy defeated the Steel Samurai!Cody:\nN-n-n-no way! No! I-it's impossible! Th-the Steel Samurai never loses! He never loses to anyone! Ever!Phoenix:\nYour Honor... The witness has revealed everything with his words. There was a reason why he lied and told us he didn't take a picture. The same reason he erased his precious photos! For Cody, it was inconceivable that the Steel Samurai could be defeated. However, Cody witnessed the impossible! He saw the Steel Samurai lose! Yet to admit what he saw would destroy everything he believed in! That's why he lied and said the Steel Samurai won. He couldn't handle the truth!Judge:\nO-Order! I will have order! W-witness! I mean, Cody! Is this true!? W-what did you see? Tell the court what you saw!Cody:\nI...... Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!Phoenix:\nCody... That day, you saw the Steel Samurai lose a fight. Right?Cody:\nWaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Okay okay! Y-you're right! Th-the Steel Samurai f-fell down... Th-then he didn't m-move... Waaaaaaaaah!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order!Edgeworth:\nWhat kind of stunt are you trying to pull, Wright!? The Steel Samurai was the murderer, not the victim!Phoenix:\nYet according to your witness's testimony, the Steel Samurai was the one who fell!Judge:\nMr. Wright! What's going on?Phoenix:\nApparently, we have all made a serious error.Edgeworth:\nAn... error? What's this all about!?Hammer was the victim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nQuite simply, the victim was Jack Hammer!\nJudge:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n...\n...\nJudge:\nUmm... Mr. Wright? We all know that.\nPhoenix:\nRight.\nJudge:\nPerhaps you'd like to reconsider your last statement?\nPhoenix:\n... I'm sorry. It was I who was wrong.\nEdgeworth:\nOkay, Wright! First you're right, now you're wrong!? Which is it!?\nPhoenix:\nL-look, I'm sure there's something we're overlooking!\nEdgeworth:\nIf you're so sure, then tell us what it is!\nLeads back to:\n\"What's this all about!?\"Steel Samurai was the victim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"If you understand what really happened, it's actually quite simple.\"There was no victim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere was no victim in this case!\nJudge:\nWh-wh-what!? Has the defense taken leave of its senses!?\nPhoenix:\nOf course, Jack Hammer died. But the Steel Samurai fell too! It was a draw!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n... Sorry. I was too shocked to say anything for a bit there. Listen, Wright! Only one person died in this incident, and that is Jack Hammer! Yet now you claim there \"was no victim\"? Are you insane?\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh, he's pulling out all the stops now.) ... I'm sorry. It was I who was wrong.\nEdgeworth:\nOkay, Wright! First you're right, now you're wrong!? Which is it!?\nPhoenix:\nL-look, I'm sure there's something we're overlooking!\nEdgeworth:\nIf you're so sure, then tell us what it is!\nLeads back to:\n\"What's this all about!?\"Phoenix:\nIf you understand what really happened, it's actually quite simple. At the end of the fight, the Steel Samurai fell to the ground, and lay still. In other words, the Steel Samurai was not the killer, he was the victim! Don't you see? Jack Hammer was the Steel Samurai!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! So, the Steel Samurai in this photograph... You're saying the man in this costume was the victim, Mr. Jack Hammer?Phoenix:\nThat's what I'm saying, Your Honor. Jack Hammer was present at the action scene run-through that morning. Thus, he obviously knew about Will Powers's foot injury.Judge:\nB-but wait! Hadn't Mr. Hammer gone to Studio One already?Phoenix:\nThat's what everyone thought! But remember what Ms. Oldbag said in her testimony?Oldbag:\nOn the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM. Did I see poor old Hammer? Nope. He'd already gone to the studio before I got back to the guard station.Phoenix:\nMr. Jack Hammer left the Employee Area after lunch. However, no one saw him going to Studio One. Nor was there a picture of him. He waited for Mr. Powers to take a nap in his dressing room. Then he snuck into the dressing room and stole the Steel Samurai costume.Judge:\n...Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nBut why would the victim do such a thing?Phoenix:\nI... don't know.Cody:\n... I get it!Phoenix:\n?Cody:\nI thought that the Steel Samurai was moving strange. So it was a different person inside the suit! Pops!Phoenix:\nHuh, me? What?Cody:\nActually, there was one piece of data I saved.Phoenix:\nData?Cody:\nYeah, a photo on my digital camera!Phoenix:\n! W-what!?Edgeworth:\nShow us, quick!Cody:\nNo way man, not if you're gonna look at me like that!Judge:\nNow!Cody:\n*sniff* Here... This is it.Judge:\n... Well, looking at this it's still a little hard to say. I'm afraid that it could be anyone in that costume. Your opinion, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nI agree, Your Honor. This isn't decisive evidence.Judge:\nI'm sorry, this doesn't look like it's the proof we need. I'll give it back.Mia:\nWait, Phoenix!Phoenix:\nMia? What?Mia:\nLook at that photo once more! That's it Phoenix! That photo is all the evidence you need to win this trial!Phoenix:\nWh-what!? Y-Your Honor! May I see that photo once more please?Judge:\nC-certainly. I don't see why not.Mia:\nPhoenix! Show him! There's a glaring, decisive inconsistency with the facts as we know them in that photo!Phoenix:\n(Find the inconsistency in the photo!)Present number \"2\" sign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor! Look at this!\"Present Steel Samurai\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's right here!\nJudge:\nThe Steel Samurai...?\nPhoenix:\nYes, that's about the only thing in this picture that could be inconsistent. The Steel Samurai is inconsistent with... something.\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWright! This is no time for daydreaming and pointless pontification! Think about your client, and us, who are forced to listen to your rambling!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, please rethink your position.\nLeads back to:\n\"Find the inconsistency in the photo!\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nI think it's here.\nJudge:\nYou seem to be lacking even more confidence than usual.\nPhoenix:\nI suppose that's because I'm not confident about it at all.\nJudge:\nMaybe you want to rethink your case, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nYes, please, Your Honor.\nLeads back to:\n\"Find the inconsistency in the photo!\"Phoenix:\nYour Honor! Look at this!Judge:\nI see... a gate?Phoenix:\nMight I draw your attention to the number on that gate?Judge:\nThe number? Ah yes. Well, it's hard to see, but it looks like a \"2.\"Phoenix:\nClearly not a \"1,\" Your Honor, correct?Edgeworth:\nAaaaaah!Phoenix:\nI believe Mr. Edgeworth sees what I'm getting at.Edgeworth:\nB-but... Th-that's impossible!Judge:\nHmm? Eh? What's this all about? Please explain so that I might be shocked along with the rest of the court.Phoenix:\nI'll use the studio guidemap. The body was found here, in Studio One. However, what do we see in this photo taken at the time of the murder? It does NOT say \"1\" on that gate in the photo. Your Honor! Here is the true scene of the crime! (Show the judge where the murder took place!)Present Studio Two\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Here, at Studio Two.\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nIt was here!\nJudge:\nWhat does that have to do with the number on the gate in the photograph...?\nPhoenix:\nUmm... well... Sorry, Your Honor, I guess I hadn't thought it that far through yet.\nJudge:\nThink it through before you point at the map this time, Mr. Wright! Once again! Where is he scene of this crime?\nLeads back to:\n\"Show the judge where the murder took place!\"Phoenix:\nHere, at Studio Two.Judge:\nI see! That would explain the \"2\" on the gate in the photo.Phoenix:\nYour Honor, I find it very significant that the murder took place in Studio Two!The trailer is there\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAs you may recall, there is a trailer in Studio Two. Now, on that day, a meeting was held in that very trailer. There was a break in the meeting corresponding to the time of death. During that break, Mr. Sal Manella and Ms. Dee Vasquez were outside, eating steak. They were at the scene of the crime! The path to the trailer was blocked!\nJudge:\nSo we have heard.\nPhoenix:\nThe path was blocked at 2:15... In other words, the victim went to Studio Two before that time!\nJudge:\nYes... yes, I suppose that would be the case.\nPhoenix:\nRemember Mr. Sal Manella's testimony? Allow me to remind the court: He said no one in the trailer was guilty because they could not have gone to Studio One. Yet, in actuality, the reverse was true! Only someone in the trailer could have committed this murder! They were the only ones with access to the scene of the crime: Studio Two!\nLeads to:\n\"O-order! Order!\"The path was blocked\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe path to the trailer was blocked!\nJudge:\nSo we have heard.\nPhoenix:\nThe path was blocked at 2:15... In other words, the victim went to Studio Two before that time!\nJudge:\nYes... yes, I suppose that would be the case.\nPhoenix:\nRemember Mr. Sal Manella's testimony? Allow me to remind the court: He said no one in the trailer was guilty because they could not have gone to Studio One. Yet, in actuality, the reverse was true! Only someone in the trailer could have committed this murder! They were the only ones with access to the scene of the crime: Studio Two! As you may recall, there is a trailer in Studio Two. Now, on that day, a meeting was held in that very trailer. There was a break in the meeting corresponding to the time of death. During that break, Mr. Sal Manella and Ms. Dee Vasquez were outside, eating steak. They were at the scene of the crime!\nLeads to:\n\"O-order! Order!\"No filming is done there\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nStudio Two is no longer being used for filming!\nJudge:\nI see... And this is significant... why?\nPhoenix:\n(Good question! I really should think these things through more.)\nJudge:\nWould you like to take another stab at it? So to speak?\nPhoenix:\nS-stabbing away, Your Honor.\nLeads back to:\n\"Your Honor, I find it very significant that the murder took place in Studio Two!\"Judge:\nO-order! Order!Phoenix:\nThe defense makes the following claims: The scene of the crime was Studio Two! The person that the security guard, Ms. Oldbag saw was the victim, Mr. Jack Hammer! Mr. Hammer, for some reason, stole a Steel Samurai costume. Then he went to Studio Two!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nThis is madness! Jack Hammer is the victim! The victim! Why would he steal a Steel Samurai costume!? Are you suggesting he did so to cover up the details of his own murder!?Phoenix:\nW-well, no, of course not...Judge:\nHmm...Edgeworth:\nOr do you have proof!? Give me proof that the victim, Jack Hammer, stole the costume!I have proof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI have proof!\nEdgeworth:\nY-you do!?\nJudge:\nYou do, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(Now that they're so surprised suddenly I'm much less confident... I think I'm right, though!)\nLeads to:\n\"Here's my proof that Jack Hammer stole the costume!\"I don't have proof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Proof? Uh oh... I'm pretty sure I don't have anything like that...)\nMia:\nPhoenix. Even if you're not 100% sure about this, you have to try. And I think you've got proof that's good enough to win them over! Just go for it! All or nothing!\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor...\nJudge:\nYes, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nActually... I do have proof.\nLeads to:\n\"Here's my proof that Jack Hammer stole the costume!\"Phoenix:\nHere's my proof that Jack Hammer stole the costume!Present Empty Bottle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This is it.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n(Wait, no, that can't be right... I've got to have some proof that will knock their socks off...)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! We don't have all the time in the world, here.\nPhoenix:\nY-yes, Your Honor!\nLeads back to:\n\"Here's my proof that Jack Hammer stole the costume!\"Phoenix:\nThis is it.Judge:\nAn empty... medicine bottle?Phoenix:\nI found this on the table in the Employee Area. The same table where Mr. Hammer and Mr. Powers ate. The label reads \"sleeping pills.\"Judge:\n\"Sleeping pills\"...?Phoenix:\nThe defendant, Mr. Powers, spent that entire afternoon sleeping. He was drugged... by Mr. Hammer!Judge:\nWait a moment... That bottle does raise some suspicions, yes. But there is no proof that Mr. Hammer used it.Phoenix:\nYour Honor, I have an idea.Test Powers's blood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge:\nAn... idea? Continue.\nPhoenix:\nRun a test of Powers's blood. You should find traces of the sleeping pills.\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis much time after the day of the murder!? Even if there were traces it still proves nothing! No blood test could tell that Hammer was the one who drugged him, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(He's right. Darn. That didn't work. Time to try another idea.)\nLeads back to:\n\"Your Honor, I have an idea.\"Fingerprint the bottle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"An... idea? Very well, let's hear it.\"Examine Hammer's body\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge:\nAn idea, Mr. Wright? And that would be?\nPhoenix:\nEr... we should examine Mr. Hammer's body.\nJudge:\nMr. Hammer...? I thought that it was Mr. Powers who was made to take the sleeping pills?\nPhoenix:\nI-indeed it was, Your Honor. (Wrong again...)\nLeads back to:\n\"Your Honor, I have an idea.\"Judge:\nAn... idea? Very well, let's hear it.Phoenix:\nI want to check this bottle for fingerprints! If my claim is true, Mr. Hammer's fingerprints should show up on this bottle!Edgeworth:\nHmm...Judge:\nI suppose you're right. Very well. The court will take possession of the bottle.Empty Bottle given to the judge.Judge:\nThis court will suspend proceedings on the current trial for today. Cody Hackin's [sic] testimony has revealed new possibilities in this case. In fact, things may have happened very differently than we previously thought. The Steel Samurai seen by Ms. Oldbag may have been the victim, Jack Hammer. The scene of the crime was not Studio One, but Studio Two. And those in the trailer did have time to commit murder. Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nYour homework is to find the answer to the following question: Why would Mr. Hammer steal the Steel Samurai costume? Also, who killed him, and why? Find the answers for me by tomorrow.Phoenix:\n(That's a lot of homework!)Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\nMm?Judge:\nYou will need to reconsider your stance in this case. Above all, you will need to reconsider your suspicion of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:\nAs you say, Your Honor.Judge:\nThis trial will be extended until tomorrow. This is the last extension! Very well... Court is adjourned!October 19, 2:47 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Phoenix:\nWhew! That was a close one!Mia:\nWe were saved by a hair, but that's all that counts. I thought seriously about going home about three times during the trial.Phoenix:\nM-me too!Will:\nReally? You both seemed so... so confident!Phoenix:\nHah! Maybe I should take up a career in acting? I was ready to pronounce you dead about three times back there.Mia:\nMe too!Will:\nD-dead!?Mia:\nHoh hoh. Of course, we're kidding.Will:\nAre you sure?Phoenix:\n(I wasn't kidding...) Now, Mr. Powers. We have to go make our final investigation. But I promise you, we'll find the true killer by tomorrow's trial!Will:\nR-right!

That statement contradicts this evidence!\nJudge:\n...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Really?\nJudge:\nObjection overruled.

That didn't go so well.)Presenting wrong evidence during testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThis evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nHow exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...?\nPhoenix:\nThey aren't, are they...\nJudge:\nNot at all.

Good going, Nick!Phoenix:\nUnder the \"initial trial\" system, tomorrow is the last day we have.Maya:\n\"Initial trial\"...? What's that?Phoenix:\nThat's the new court system they introduced two or three years ago. They had so many cases in the system, they decided to speed the whole process up.Maya:\nSo, under that system, trials have to end in three days?Phoenix:\nYeah, pretty much. Well, we've no time to waste!Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Steel Samurai\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI don't get it, Maya. Why would Mr. Hammer steal the Steel Samurai costume?\nMaya:\nWhat!?

Why?\nPhoenix:\nBecause the real scene of the crime was Studio Two... where that trailer is!\nMaya:\nWhaaaat!?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... was Maya always this excitable?)\n\n\n\n\nAny ideas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, have you noticed anything that might help us?\nMaya:\nI can't see what's going on when Mia is here...

I'm pretty sure it's not even Will Powers inside that suit.\nMaya:\nNo true fan would be satisfied with anything less than the real thing! He's still a child, I suppose...

She's well respected in the industry. They say she's a genius.\nMaya:\nA genius...?\nWill:\nShe's been at Global Studios for five years now. Right or wrong, nobody dares tell her different these days.\nPhoenix:\nWhy is that?\nWill:\nEver since she came on board, we've had nothing but hits. Global Studios was on its knees, but she picked it up and made it shine. Oh, and...\nMaya:\nAnd... what?\nWill:\nN-nothing. Forget it. I... I've only heard rumors, anyhow.\n\n\n\n\nDirector Manella\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nCan you tell me anything about Mr. Manella?\nWill:\nOh, he used to be a minor straight-to-video director. But something in his work caught Vasquez's eye. She brought the Steel Samurai idea to him. Now everyone knows the name Sal Manella. I hear he's pretty much at her beck and call, though. Whenever she says \"jump!\" he asks \"how high?\" and all that.\nPhoenix:\n(I can imagine him being at her beck and call... though I can't imagine him jumping.)\n\n\n\n\nMr. Hammer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nI was wondering about Mr. Hammer... He was a big star back in the day, right? But then he just dropped off the face of the Earth.\nWill:\nOh... Yes, you're right. In fact, he was my role model when I started in this business. But he just stopped taking on big roles. That's when he began appearing in little productions at Global...\nMaya:\nHow could he do that!? I was really looking forward to a sequel to \"Samurai Summer.\"\nWill:\nHe just gave up being a star five years ago. Actually, now that I think about it... That was right when Ms. Vasquez came to Global.\nPhoenix:\n(Five years ago...?)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPowers's(?)

Why?\nPhoenix:\nYou're the medium! Why don't you summon up Mr. Hammer's spirit and ask him yourself?\nMaya:\n*sigh* Gimme about three more years.\nPhoenix:\n(Look at us, the two novices.)\n\n\n\n\n\"Path to Glory\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHave you seen this, Mr. Powers?\nWill:\nW-what's that!? I've never seen these Steel Samurais in my life...\nPhoenix:\nThese are the Steel Samurais that appear at live shows. A fanboy collected all these pictures himself.\nWill:\n...

So she always gets her way.\nPhoenix:\n(She seems bitter...)\nMaya:\nDo you... not like the producer?\nOldbag:\nLook, the studio people don't want me talking about her, so, sorry.\n\n\n\n\nDirector Manella\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nCan I ask you about Sal Manella, the director?\nOldbag:\nSal? He's soft--a pushover. Does whatever Vasquez tells him to. She treats him like dirt, but I think he likes it.\nMaya:\nHuh? Why would anyone like being treated like dirt? That doesn't make any sense, does it, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nEr... No, no it doesn't, Maya.\n\n\n\n\nMr. Hammer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAbout Mr. Hammer...\nOldbag:\nArrgh! I heard about what you said today! Cheeky whippersnapper! Poor old Hammer! You'd drag his star down from the sky and stomp on it! Calling him a criminal! A thief! I-I-I-I... I won't forget this!!!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh, she's really pissed this time!)\nOldbag:\nYou listen to me, whippersnapper! My poor old Hammer would never do such a thing!

I'm not in the mood for thinking, thank you very much.October 19Studio One EntranceMaya:\nThink back, Nick, to the day of the murder... Mr. Hammer put on the Steel Samurai costume. Then he left from here to go to Studio Two...?Phoenix:\nRight.Maya:\nBut why? I wonder if someone called him...? Like the director, or the producer...?Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft path\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nStudio Two is down that way.

(Changed from [Edgeworth is out of control!] in the original release) He was in the waiting room and he crushed this paper cup with hot, hot coffee in it.\nPhoenix:\nWhoa...\nGumshoe:\nTalk about burns, pal!\nMaya:\nWow! The fury of Edgeworth!Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteak Plate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nIt's looking like Will Powers was drugged...

But I was kind of impressed at today's trial, too.\nMaya:\n...!\nGumshoe:\nMost lawyers would've given up after that director's testimony. I think if it'd been anyone but you up there, Powers would be done for by now.\n\n\n\n\nSleeping Pill Bottle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nDetective, about that bottle...\nGumshoe:\nOh, that? Talk about embarrassing, pal! I can't believe I missed that on my first sweep for evidence. Don't know how I can apologize to Mr. Edgeworth.\nMaya:\nIt must be tough being a detective, with all that responsibility...\nGumshoe:\nOh, heh heh. *blush*\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nI'm guessing I know as much about that as you do, pal, i.e. nothing.Before clearing all Talk options in Detention Center - Visitor's Room:October 18Global StudiosDressing RoomMaya:\nEmpty dressing rooms like this are kinda lonely, aren't they?Phoenix:\nI'm sure Mr. Powers will be back soon.

I thought he went to Studio One?\nMaya:\nHe stole the Steel Samurai costume, too!\nPenny:\nWhat!? Why would Mr. Hammer do something like that? ... Oh... I guess the rumor must be true, then.\nMaya:\nThe rumor?\nPenny:\nYeah. Mr. Vasquez, that producer, had some kind of hold on Hammer. She had some dirt on him... He'd do anything she said, apparently.\nMaya:\nSome \"dirt\"? What dirt!\nPenny:\n... Dirt. You know, bad stuff.\nMaya:\n... Um, I know what dirt means...\nPenny:\nAbout five years ago, they were filming a movie starring Mr. Hammer. They were using the new studio... Studio Two. Some sort of accident happened during filming. After that, they never used Studio Two again. They left the film set the way it was, too.\nPhoenix:\n(The film set...? Was that trailer part of the film set, then?)\n\n\n\n\nThe last episode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nW-what do you mean, the \"last Steel Samurai\"!?\nPenny:\nI know it's a shock, but nothing can be done to save it now. Whoever really did kill Mr. Hammer, also signed the Steel Samurai's death warrant.\nMaya:\nNo... no!\nPenny:\nAlso, I hear that Global Studios is going to change its programming. They're not going to make kids' shows anymore.\nMaya:\nW-what!? Why!?\nPenny:\nI don't know. It's sad, but that's what Global Studios decided.\n\n\n\n\nStudio policy (appears after \"The last episode\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy aren't they going to make kids' shows anymore?\nPenny:\nThe studio bigwigs don't want the Steel Samurai around anymore. They want to forget all this ever happened. They want it quiet, you understand?\nMaya:\nH-how can they just do that! What about all the kids who love the Steel Samurai!\nPenny:\nIt's okay. I'm sure the kids will be fine. They'll find a new hero to follow.\nMaya:\nNo, that can't be true! If the program just ends, they'll be heartbroken for sure! N-Nick! Say something!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... yeah. (I think evidence, rather than words, is called for here.) Here, take a look at this.\n\n\n\nPresent \"Path to Glory\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"And this is...?\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPenny:\nWhat's this?\nPhoenix:\nThis is why you can't stop the Steel Samurai.\nPenny:\nI'm sorry...

Let's try that again.)\nLeads back to:\n\"I think evidence, rather than words, is called for here.\"\n\n\nPenny:\nAnd this is...?\nPhoenix:\nA fan collected all of these photographs. The kids love the Steel Samurai! The show shouldn't be cancelled just so some adults can save face! I would think you would understand that better than anyone.\nPenny:\n... ... You're right... Okay! But what can I do?\nPhoenix:\nWell, for starters... You can tell me something. Tell me what it is that Global Studios is so intent on hiding? Tell me about this accident five years ago.\nPenny:\n... Okay!\n\n\n\n\nFive years ago (appears after \"Mr. Hammer\", before clearing \"Studio policy\" Talk option)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAn accident five years ago?\nPenny:\nYes, in Studio Two. That trailer there was part of the film set.\nPhoenix:\nCould you tell us what happened?\nPenny:\n... S-sorry. I don't think I can. They really don't want us to talk about it.\n\n\n\n\nFive years ago (after clearing \"Studio policy\" Talk option)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nCould you tell us what happened five years ago?\nPenny:\nWell, I can tell you what I've heard. Apparently, five years ago, someone died... and it was Hammer's fault.\nMaya:\nS-someone died!?\nPenny:\nIt was an accident, of course! Anyway... The producer, Ms. Vasquez managed to hush it up.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's the \"dirt\" she had on Mr. Hammer?\nMaya:\nAnd that's why Mr. Hammer would do anything Ms. Vasquez asked him to do! ... But, it was an accident, right? Why didn't they just make it public?\nPenny:\nWell, you know Mr. Hammer was a big star back then. They were afraid about what would happen to his career if word got out.\nMaya:\nI see...\nPenny:\nYou know who knows more about this? Ms. Oldbag. She was here at the studios back then, you know.\nPhoenix:\nThanks. We'll try asking her. (If she'll talk...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPowers's(?)

I suppose you think this is fun!?\nPhoenix:\nN-no, I'm just doing my job to protect Mr. Powers...\nOldbag:\nAnd you claim that Hammer stole Powers's costume! You expect me to believe that rubbish!?

I hope both the prosecution and the defense will be able to present decisive evidence. Very well, Mr. Edgeworth. Your opening statement.Edgeworth:\nIn yesterday's session, the defense presented us with a new theory for this case. He claims that the scene of the crime was, in fact, Studio Two. Today, I will call on people present in the Studio Two trailer that day. From their testimonies, the truth will become clear.Judge:\nHmm... very well!Phoenix:\n(Edgeworth seems a bit on edge today...)Judge:\nYou may call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution calls Ms. Dee Vasquez to the stand. Ms. Dee Vasquez is a producer who was present in the Studio Two trailer that day.Edgeworth:\nWill the witness state her name and occupation?Vasquez:\n... Dee Vasquez. I am a producer for Global Studios.Edgeworth:\nOn the day of the murder, you were in the trailer in Studio Two...Vasquez:\nAs everyone here knows, yes?Edgeworth:\n...?Vasquez:\nI dislike needless banter.

So to speak.)Witness Testimony-- The Day of the Murder --Vasquez:\nI entered the trailer, oh, a little before noon.\nThe meeting began at 12:00 sharp. It ended at 4:00.\nThere was to be a rehearsal afterwards, so we went to Studio One...\nI was fatigued, so I had Sal take me.\nAt 2:30, we took a 15-minute break in the meeting.\nSal and I ate t-bone steaks on the table in front of the trailer.\nWe found Hammer's body later, when we all went to Studio One.\nThat's all.Judge:\nHmm... I have a question about one part of your testimony. You were \"fatigued\" so you had Sal \"take\" you...?Vasquez:\nThe van.Judge:\nHmm?Vasquez:\nThere's a van at Studio Two. I had him take me in that. I thought it might be risky to walk, what with that monkey's head toppling over.Van added to the Court Record.Judge:\nI... I see! Very well.

I guess the Steel Samurai was moving a little strange...\nPhoenix:\n(Moving... strangely?)Cody:\nSo I held up my camera to take a picture!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy couldn't you take a picture?\nCody:\nMy new camera has too many buttons. I couldn't figure it out. I tried to take a picture, I really tried.Cody:\nBut the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhen the lens opened, what did you see?\nCody:\nUh... well, a person on the ground. And the Steel Samurai!Cody:\nTh-that's all that happened. Yup.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThat's all?\nCody:\nY-yeah! I told you, I didn't take a picture!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I would have, once I got that lens open... Did he really not take a picture? Not even one?)\n\n\n\nPress him hard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Nah, he definitely would have taken a picture. There's got to be something here I can use!) Cody! Listen up, Cody Hackins. I know exactly what happened that day. You took a picture!\nCody:\n... Hey!\nPhoenix:\n(Bullseye...?)\nCody:\nH-how did you know!?\nPhoenix:\nI see through all your lies Cody Hackins. It's one of my powers!\nCody:\nW-wow!\nPhoenix:\n(This feels great!)\nCody:\nY-yeah... Yeah, I took a picture.\nJudge:\nPerhaps you can change your testimony to reflect this, Cody?\nChanges statement from \"Th-that's all that happened. Yup.\" to \"I took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em.\"\n\n\n\n\nLet it slide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(He looks ready to burst into tears... I'd better lay off him for now.)\nLeads back to cross-examinationCody:\nI took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou \"erased\" them?\nCody:\nY-yeah!\nPhoenix:\nWhy would you erase a picture of your beloved Steel Samurai, victorious?\nCody:\nWell... y'know. W-why would I want to keep a picture like that?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... he's becoming less and less cooperative. I better find a clear contradiction soon... or some solid evidence.)Present \"Path to Glory\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Cody!\"Phoenix:\n(How can I pick holes in such a short testimony?)Mia:\nThere has to be something. Dig up the dirt, Phoenix! Find out what this kid's all about!Phoenix:\nCody!Cody:\nWh-wh-what!? Man, every time you say \"Cody\" you follow it with something bad.Phoenix:\nI just wanted to thank you for giving me this the other day.Cody:\nHuh? O-oh... right.Phoenix:\nWhat was it you told me then?Cody:\nI go to every live performance! I always take a picture when the Steel Samurai lands the final blow! Whizzam! I got 'em all! I never missed one! A perfect collection!Phoenix:\nCody. Did you really get a picture of the Steel Samurai standing victorious over his foe? If you did, I find it hard to believe that you would just erase it! Wouldn't you keep it for your album?Cody:\nAh!Judge:\nMr. Wright... What exactly is this album?Phoenix:\nIt's called \"Path to Glory.\" It's a collection of pictures of the Steel Samurai, all taken by Cody Hackins. He claims it's a perfect collection of every battle the Steel Samurai has won!Judge:\nI... I see.Phoenix:\nDon't you find this very odd, Your Honor? Among all his pictures of the Steel Samurai, none were taken that day!Judge:\nOrder! Mr. Wright. Have you an explanation? If the Steel Samurai had just defeated his adversary... I certainly would expect to see a picture of it in this album...Phoenix:\nExactly my point, Your Honor! ... ... .........! (No... wait... no way!)Mia:\nPhoenix? I think we've finally discovered the truth. And what a truth it is!Phoenix:\nM-Mia... are we sure about this? Did he actually...?Mia:\nYes. I'm pretty sure what you're thinking is right. Tell them, Phoenix. Tell them what the truth is.Judge:\nMr. Wright! Please explain to the court what is going on here! Why was there no picture in the album from the day of the murder? Why would the boy have erased the photos he took?The photos were blurry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI believe that Cody Hackins is what we call an \"artiste.\"\nJudge:\nAn... \"artiste\"...?\nPhoenix:\nHe didn't like the photos he had taken! They were blurry, or maybe his framing was off... Anyway, for some reason, he erased the data!\nJudge:\nIs that right, Cody?\nCody:\nWh-what do you mean \"framing was off\"!?\nJudge:\nIt seems the only thing \"off\" is your guesswork, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nUm, uh... Yes, well, I'm sure the real reason is...\nJudge:\nYes? The real reason is?\nLeads back to:\n\"Why was there no picture in the album from the day of the murder?\"He erased them by mistake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSimple, Your Honor. Cody wasn't used to using his new camera. He erased those photos he took by mistake!\nMia:\nW-wait a second, Phoenix. If that's your answer, we're back where we started!\nPhoenix:\nHuh? You mean, that wasn't it?\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! If you have something to say to the court, speak up!\nPhoenix:\nUm, well... S-sorry, Your Honor. Can I change my answer?\nJudge:\nHmm... *sigh*\nLeads back to:\n\"Why was there no picture in the album from the day of the murder?\"The Steel Samurai didn't win\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"I can think of only one reason, Your Honor.\"Phoenix:\nI can think of only one reason, Your Honor. The Steel Samurai didn't win! That's why Cody deleted those photos.Judge:\nYou mean the Steel Samurai... lost?Phoenix:\nWell, Cody? I'm right, aren't I? Tell the truth. The bad guy defeated the Steel Samurai!Cody:\nN-n-n-no way! No! I-it's impossible! Th-the Steel Samurai never loses! He never loses to anyone! Ever!Phoenix:\nYour Honor... The witness has revealed everything with his words. There was a reason why he lied and told us he didn't take a picture. The same reason he erased his precious photos! For Cody, it was inconceivable that the Steel Samurai could be defeated. However, Cody witnessed the impossible! He saw the Steel Samurai lose! Yet to admit what he saw would destroy everything he believed in! That's why he lied and said the Steel Samurai won. He couldn't handle the truth!Judge:\nO-Order! I will have order! W-witness! I mean, Cody! Is this true!? W-what did you see? Tell the court what you saw!Cody:\nI...... Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!Phoenix:\nCody... That day, you saw the Steel Samurai lose a fight. Right?Cody:\nWaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Okay okay! Y-you're right! Th-the Steel Samurai f-fell down... Th-then he didn't m-move... Waaaaaaaaah!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order!Edgeworth:\nWhat kind of stunt are you trying to pull, Wright!? The Steel Samurai was the murderer, not the victim!Phoenix:\nYet according to your witness's testimony, the Steel Samurai was the one who fell!Judge:\nMr. Wright! What's going on?Phoenix:\nApparently, we have all made a serious error.Edgeworth:\nAn... error? What's this all about!?Hammer was the victim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nQuite simply, the victim was Jack Hammer!\nJudge:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n...\n...\nJudge:\nUmm... Mr. Wright? We all know that.\nPhoenix:\nRight.\nJudge:\nPerhaps you'd like to reconsider your last statement?\nPhoenix:\n... I'm sorry. It was I who was wrong.\nEdgeworth:\nOkay, Wright! First you're right, now you're wrong!? Which is it!?\nPhoenix:\nL-look, I'm sure there's something we're overlooking!\nEdgeworth:\nIf you're so sure, then tell us what it is!\nLeads back to:\n\"What's this all about!?\"Steel Samurai was the victim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"If you understand what really happened, it's actually quite simple.\"There was no victim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere was no victim in this case!\nJudge:\nWh-wh-what!? Has the defense taken leave of its senses!?\nPhoenix:\nOf course, Jack Hammer died. But the Steel Samurai fell too! It was a draw!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n... Sorry. I was too shocked to say anything for a bit there. Listen, Wright! Only one person died in this incident, and that is Jack Hammer! Yet now you claim there \"was no victim\"? Are you insane?\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh, he's pulling out all the stops now.) ... I'm sorry. It was I who was wrong.\nEdgeworth:\nOkay, Wright! First you're right, now you're wrong!? Which is it!?\nPhoenix:\nL-look, I'm sure there's something we're overlooking!\nEdgeworth:\nIf you're so sure, then tell us what it is!\nLeads back to:\n\"What's this all about!?\"Phoenix:\nIf you understand what really happened, it's actually quite simple. At the end of the fight, the Steel Samurai fell to the ground, and lay still. In other words, the Steel Samurai was not the killer, he was the victim! Don't you see? Jack Hammer was the Steel Samurai!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! So, the Steel Samurai in this photograph... You're saying the man in this costume was the victim, Mr. Jack Hammer?Phoenix:\nThat's what I'm saying, Your Honor. Jack Hammer was present at the action scene run-through that morning. Thus, he obviously knew about Will Powers's foot injury.Judge:\nB-but wait! Hadn't Mr. Hammer gone to Studio One already?Phoenix:\nThat's what everyone thought! But remember what Ms. Oldbag said in her testimony?Oldbag:\nOn the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM. Did I see poor old Hammer? Nope. He'd already gone to the studio before I got back to the guard station.Phoenix:\nMr. Jack Hammer left the Employee Area after lunch. However, no one saw him going to Studio One. Nor was there a picture of him. He waited for Mr. Powers to take a nap in his dressing room. Then he snuck into the dressing room and stole the Steel Samurai costume.Judge:\n...Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nBut why would the victim do such a thing?Phoenix:\nI... don't know.Cody:\n... I get it!Phoenix:\n?Cody:\nI thought that the Steel Samurai was moving strange. So it was a different person inside the suit! Pops!Phoenix:\nHuh, me? What?Cody:\nActually, there was one piece of data I saved.Phoenix:\nData?Cody:\nYeah, a photo on my digital camera!Phoenix:\n! W-what!?Edgeworth:\nShow us, quick!Cody:\nNo way man, not if you're gonna look at me like that!Judge:\nNow!Cody:\n*sniff* Here... This is it.Judge:\n... Well, looking at this it's still a little hard to say. I'm afraid that it could be anyone in that costume. Your opinion, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nI agree, Your Honor. This isn't decisive evidence.Judge:\nI'm sorry, this doesn't look like it's the proof we need. I'll give it back.Mia:\nWait, Phoenix!Phoenix:\nMia? What?Mia:\nLook at that photo once more! That's it Phoenix! That photo is all the evidence you need to win this trial!Phoenix:\nWh-what!? Y-Your Honor! May I see that photo once more please?Judge:\nC-certainly. I don't see why not.Mia:\nPhoenix! Show him! There's a glaring, decisive inconsistency with the facts as we know them in that photo!Phoenix:\n(Find the inconsistency in the photo!)Present number \"2\" sign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor! Look at this!\"Present Steel Samurai\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's right here!\nJudge:\nThe Steel Samurai...?\nPhoenix:\nYes, that's about the only thing in this picture that could be inconsistent. The Steel Samurai is inconsistent with... something.\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWright! This is no time for daydreaming and pointless pontification! Think about your client, and us, who are forced to listen to your rambling!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, please rethink your position.\nLeads back to:\n\"Find the inconsistency in the photo!\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nI think it's here.\nJudge:\nYou seem to be lacking even more confidence than usual.\nPhoenix:\nI suppose that's because I'm not confident about it at all.\nJudge:\nMaybe you want to rethink your case, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nYes, please, Your Honor.\nLeads back to:\n\"Find the inconsistency in the photo!\"Phoenix:\nYour Honor! Look at this!Judge:\nI see... a gate?Phoenix:\nMight I draw your attention to the number on that gate?Judge:\nThe number? Ah yes. Well, it's hard to see, but it looks like a \"2.\"Phoenix:\nClearly not a \"1,\" Your Honor, correct?Edgeworth:\nAaaaaah!Phoenix:\nI believe Mr. Edgeworth sees what I'm getting at.Edgeworth:\nB-but... Th-that's impossible!Judge:\nHmm? Eh? What's this all about? Please explain so that I might be shocked along with the rest of the court.Phoenix:\nI'll use the studio guidemap. The body was found here, in Studio One. However, what do we see in this photo taken at the time of the murder? It does NOT say \"1\" on that gate in the photo. Your Honor! Here is the true scene of the crime! (Show the judge where the murder took place!)Present Studio Two\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Here, at Studio Two.\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nIt was here!\nJudge:\nWhat does that have to do with the number on the gate in the photograph...?\nPhoenix:\nUmm... well... Sorry, Your Honor, I guess I hadn't thought it that far through yet.\nJudge:\nThink it through before you point at the map this time, Mr. Wright! Once again! Where is he scene of this crime?\nLeads back to:\n\"Show the judge where the murder took place!\"Phoenix:\nHere, at Studio Two.Judge:\nI see! That would explain the \"2\" on the gate in the photo.Phoenix:\nYour Honor, I find it very significant that the murder took place in Studio Two!The trailer is there\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAs you may recall, there is a trailer in Studio Two. Now, on that day, a meeting was held in that very trailer. There was a break in the meeting corresponding to the time of death. During that break, Mr. Sal Manella and Ms. Dee Vasquez were outside, eating steak. They were at the scene of the crime! The path to the trailer was blocked!\nJudge:\nSo we have heard.\nPhoenix:\nThe path was blocked at 2:15... In other words, the victim went to Studio Two before that time!\nJudge:\nYes... yes, I suppose that would be the case.\nPhoenix:\nRemember Mr. Sal Manella's testimony? Allow me to remind the court: He said no one in the trailer was guilty because they could not have gone to Studio One. Yet, in actuality, the reverse was true! Only someone in the trailer could have committed this murder! They were the only ones with access to the scene of the crime: Studio Two!\nLeads to:\n\"O-order! Order!\"The path was blocked\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe path to the trailer was blocked!\nJudge:\nSo we have heard.\nPhoenix:\nThe path was blocked at 2:15...

I really should think these things through more.)\nJudge:\nWould you like to take another stab at it? So to speak?\nPhoenix:\nS-stabbing away, Your Honor.\nLeads back to:\n\"Your Honor, I find it very significant that the murder took place in Studio Two!\"Judge:\nO-order!

Mr. Hammer, for some reason, stole a Steel Samurai costume. Then he went to Studio Two!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nThis is madness! Jack Hammer is the victim! The victim! Why would he steal a Steel Samurai costume!? Are you suggesting he did so to cover up the details of his own murder!?Phoenix:\nW-well, no, of course not...Judge:\nHmm...Edgeworth:\nOr do you have proof!? Give me proof that the victim, Jack Hammer, stole the costume!I have proof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI have proof!\nEdgeworth:\nY-you do!?\nJudge:\nYou do, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(Now that they're so surprised suddenly I'm much less confident...

The same table where Mr. Hammer and Mr. Powers ate. The label reads \"sleeping pills.\"Judge:\n\"Sleeping pills\"...?Phoenix:\nThe defendant, Mr. Powers, spent that entire afternoon sleeping. He was drugged... by Mr. Hammer!Judge:\nWait a moment... That bottle does raise some suspicions, yes. But there is no proof that Mr. Hammer used it.Phoenix:\nYour Honor, I have an idea.Test Powers's blood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge:\nAn... idea? Continue.\nPhoenix:\nRun a test of Powers's blood. You should find traces of the sleeping pills.\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis much time after the day of the murder!? Even if there were traces it still proves nothing! No blood test could tell that Hammer was the one who drugged him, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(He's right. Darn. That didn't work.

The court will take possession of the bottle.Empty Bottle given to the judge.Judge:\nThis court will suspend proceedings on the current trial for today. Cody Hackin's [sic] testimony has revealed new possibilities in this case. In fact, things may have happened very differently than we previously thought. The Steel Samurai seen by Ms. Oldbag may have been the victim, Jack Hammer. The scene of the crime was not Studio One, but Studio Two. And those in the trailer did have time to commit murder. Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nYour homework is to find the answer to the following question: Why would Mr. Hammer steal the Steel Samurai costume? Also, who killed him, and why? Find the answers for me by tomorrow.Phoenix:\n(That's a lot of homework!)Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\nMm?Judge:\nYou will need to reconsider your stance in this case. Above all, you will need to reconsider your suspicion of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:\nAs you say, Your Honor.Judge:\nThis trial will be extended until tomorrow. This is the last extension!

I'm pretty sure it's not even Will Powers inside that suit.\nMaya:\nNo true fan would be satisfied with anything less than the real thing! He's still a child, I suppose...

She's well respected in the industry. They say she's a genius.\nMaya:\nA genius...?\nWill:\nShe's been at Global Studios for five years now. Right or wrong, nobody dares tell her different these days.\nPhoenix:\nWhy is that?\nWill:\nEver since she came on board, we've had nothing but hits. Global Studios was on its knees, but she picked it up and made it shine. Oh, and...\nMaya:\nAnd... what?\nWill:\nN-nothing. Forget it. I... I've only heard rumors, anyhow.\n\n\n\n\nDirector Manella\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nCan you tell me anything about Mr. Manella?\nWill:\nOh, he used to be a minor straight-to-video director. But something in his work caught Vasquez's eye. She brought the Steel Samurai idea to him. Now everyone knows the name Sal Manella. I hear he's pretty much at her beck and call, though. Whenever she says \"jump!\" he asks \"how high?\" and all that.\nPhoenix:\n(I can imagine him being at her beck and call... though I can't imagine him jumping.)\n\n\n\n\nMr. Hammer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nI was wondering about Mr. Hammer... He was a big star back in the day, right? But then he just dropped off the face of the Earth.\nWill:\nOh... Yes, you're right. In fact, he was my role model when I started in this business. But he just stopped taking on big roles. That's when he began appearing in little productions at Global...\nMaya:\nHow could he do that!? I was really looking forward to a sequel to \"Samurai Summer.\"\nWill:\nHe just gave up being a star five years ago. Actually, now that I think about it... That was right when Ms. Vasquez came to Global.\nPhoenix:\n(Five years ago...?)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPowers's(?)

Why?\nPhoenix:\nYou're the medium! Why don't you summon up Mr. Hammer's spirit and ask him yourself?\nMaya:\n*sigh* Gimme about three more years.\nPhoenix:\n(Look at us, the two novices.)\n\n\n\n\n\"Path to Glory\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHave you seen this, Mr. Powers?\nWill:\nW-what's that!?

He's soft--a pushover. Does whatever Vasquez tells him to. She treats him like dirt, but I think he likes it.\nMaya:\nHuh? Why would anyone like being treated like dirt? That doesn't make any sense, does it, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nEr... No, no it doesn't, Maya.\n\n\n\n\nMr. Hammer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAbout Mr. Hammer...\nOldbag:\nArrgh!

I won't forget this!!!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh, she's really pissed this time!)\nOldbag:\nYou listen to me, whippersnapper! My poor old Hammer would never do such a thing!

I thought he went to Studio One?\nMaya:\nHe stole the Steel Samurai costume, too!\nPenny:\nWhat!? Why would Mr. Hammer do something like that? ... Oh... I guess the rumor must be true, then.\nMaya:\nThe rumor?\nPenny:\nYeah. Mr. Vasquez, that producer, had some kind of hold on Hammer. She had some dirt on him... He'd do anything she said, apparently.\nMaya:\nSome \"dirt\"? What dirt!\nPenny:\n... Dirt. You know, bad stuff.\nMaya:\n... Um, I know what dirt means...\nPenny:\nAbout five years ago, they were filming a movie starring Mr. Hammer. They were using the new studio... Studio Two. Some sort of accident happened during filming. After that, they never used Studio Two again. They left the film set the way it was, too.\nPhoenix:\n(The film set...? Was that trailer part of the film set, then?)\n\n\n\n\nThe last episode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nW-what do you mean, the \"last Steel Samurai\"!?\nPenny:\nI know it's a shock, but nothing can be done to save it now. Whoever really did kill Mr. Hammer, also signed the Steel Samurai's death warrant.\nMaya:\nNo... no!\nPenny:\nAlso, I hear that Global Studios is going to change its programming. They're not going to make kids' shows anymore.\nMaya:\nW-what!? Why!?\nPenny:\nI don't know.

They want to forget all this ever happened. They want it quiet, you understand?\nMaya:\nH-how can they just do that! What about all the kids who love the Steel Samurai!\nPenny:\nIt's okay. I'm sure the kids will be fine. They'll find a new hero to follow.\nMaya:\nNo, that can't be true! If the program just ends, they'll be heartbroken for sure! N-Nick!

But what can I do?\nPhoenix:\nWell, for starters... You can tell me something. Tell me what it is that Global Studios is so intent on hiding? Tell me about this accident five years ago.\nPenny:\n... Okay!\n\n\n\n\nFive years ago (appears after \"Mr. Hammer\", before clearing \"Studio policy\" Talk option)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAn accident five years ago?\nPenny:\nYes, in Studio Two.

Apparently, five years ago, someone died... and it was Hammer's fault.\nMaya:\nS-someone died!?\nPenny:\nIt was an accident, of course! Anyway... The producer, Ms. Vasquez managed to hush it up.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's the \"dirt\" she had on Mr. Hammer?\nMaya:\nAnd that's why Mr. Hammer would do anything Ms. Vasquez asked him to do! ... But, it was an accident, right? Why didn't they just make it public?\nPenny:\nWell, you know Mr. Hammer was a big star back then. They were afraid about what would happen to his career if word got out.\nMaya:\nI see...\nPenny:\nYou know who knows more about this? Ms. Oldbag.

That photo, well, it caused quite a stir. And guess who made it all better? Vasquez! She has ties to the mafia... She silenced that paparazzi. That was the beginning. After that, she became a force to be reckoned with here at the studio.Maya:\nI see...!Oldbag:\nBut, you have to understand...

The wind. ... Your conversation interests me. Let's talk about it more inside the trailer.Maya:\nNick. She went inside the trailer.TrailerVasquez:\nHmph. You came. Well then, what was that you were talking about?Phoenix:\n(...! Why is she so eager to talk all of a sudden?) Ms. Vasquez. You were using that accident! You were blackmailing Mr. Hammer so you could control him, weren't you? That's why he was doing kids' shows for petty change!Vasquez:\nHmph... So I'm a blackmailer now?Maya:\nWell, that's what it was, wasn't it! I mean, sure, it was an accident... But you used it to drag Mr. Hammer down from his rightful place as a star!Vasquez:\nOh...?

Well, she was a big fan of Hammer's, you see. She jumped on the reporter who brought that photo into the studio. She wrenched it out of his hands, she did. Gave him a few bruises, too.Phoenix:\n(... So that's why she had the photo...)Vasquez:\nShe's an old fool. Of course, all the reporter would need is the negatives. He could have made a copy. But he didn't.

I hope both the prosecution and the defense will be able to present decisive evidence. Very well, Mr. Edgeworth. Your opening statement.Edgeworth:\nIn yesterday's session, the defense presented us with a new theory for this case. He claims that the scene of the crime was, in fact, Studio Two. Today, I will call on people present in the Studio Two trailer that day. From their testimonies, the truth will become clear.Judge:\nHmm... very well!Phoenix:\n(Edgeworth seems a bit on edge today...)Judge:\nYou may call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution calls Ms. Dee Vasquez to the stand. Ms. Dee Vasquez is a producer who was present in the Studio Two trailer that day.Edgeworth:\nWill the witness state her name and occupation?Vasquez:\n... Dee Vasquez. I am a producer for Global Studios.Edgeworth:\nOn the day of the murder, you were in the trailer in Studio Two...Vasquez:\nAs everyone here knows, yes?Edgeworth:\n...?Vasquez:\nI dislike needless banter. If you must pontificate, do it when I'm not here.Edgeworth:\nMrrph!Judge:\nV-very well, Ms. Vasquez. Please give the court your testimony concerning the day of the murder.Maya:\nNick! I know she did it! Make her pay!Phoenix:\nR-right! (If she's guilty, I'll catch her with her pants down... So to speak.)Witness Testimony-- The Day of the Murder --Vasquez:\nI entered the trailer, oh, a little before noon.\nThe meeting began at 12:00 sharp. It ended at 4:00.\nThere was to be a rehearsal afterwards, so we went to Studio One...\nI was fatigued, so I had Sal take me.\nAt 2:30, we took a 15-minute break in the meeting.\nSal and I ate t-bone steaks on the table in front of the trailer.\nWe found Hammer's body later, when we all went to Studio One.\nThat's all.Judge:\nHmm... I have a question about one part of your testimony. You were \"fatigued\" so you had Sal \"take\" you...?Vasquez:\nThe van.Judge:\nHmm?Vasquez:\nThere's a van at Studio Two. I had him take me in that. I thought it might be risky to walk, what with that monkey's head toppling over.Van added to the Court Record.Judge:\nI... I see! Very well.

It ended at 4:00.\"**\n   - No immediate evidence contradicts this.\n\n3. **Testimony Statement: \"There was to be a rehearsal afterwards, so we went to Studio One.\"**\n   - No immediate evidence contradicts this directly, but it aligns with the potential need to visit Studio One.\n\n4. **Testimony Statement: \"I was fatigued, so I had Sal take me.\"**\n   - This is explained by the presence of a van, providing context rather than contradiction.\n\n5. **Testimony Statement: \"At 2:30, we took a 15-minute break in the meeting.\"**\n   - The time 2:30 is critical as it relates to the time of death of Jack Hammer at Studio Two, and further info will be crucial.\n\n6. **Testimony Statement: \"Sal and I ate t-bone steaks on the table in front of the trailer.\"**\n   - This should directly agree or contradict the Steak Plate which has evidence of drugging or usage.\n\n7. **Testimony Statement: \"We found Hammer's body later, when we all went to Studio One.\"**\n   - Contradictory location in evidence: The testimony attempts to relocate where the body should be found (Studio Two according to evidence).\n\nAnalyzing available evidence:\n\n- **Guidemap (2)**: Indicates a clear layout of the studios.\n- **Jack's Autopsy Report (3)**: Time of death: 10/15 at 2:30 PM - contradicts the implication that they were somewhere else and unaware of the murder.\n- **Steak Plate (16)**: Found with traces of sleeping pills, challenges the claim of a simple break without incident or knowledge.\n\n**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**\n\nThe most immediate contradiction involves the timing of events and whereabouts at the critical time of murder (2:30 PM) connected to the Steak Plate:\n\n1. The meeting break at 2:30 PM aligns with the time of death but directly switching from a rehearsal intent to finding a body needs analyzing.\n2. The mention of t-bone steaks aligns with drugged plates raising suspicion on the truth of the simple claim interim 'eating.'\n3. The crucial contradiction is between *found at Studio One* given evidence points to Studio Two based on the photograph presented previously in court and evidence transition location.\n\nGiven all the information, inconsistency scrutiny reliably focuses on mid-point or belated actions towards Studio One being claimed:\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"present\",\n  \"testimony\": 6,\n  \"evidence\": 16\n}\n```\n\nThis refutes the straightforward version of events Dee Vasquez provides, challenging her mid-point logistics and masking of exact activities around a pivotal timeline tied directly to murder occurrence expectations.\n"

Mia's murder was the talk of the town for some time... But no one paid any attention to the Wright & Co. Law Offices... How am I going to pay the rent this month?Maya:\nIt'll be okay.

Please, Nick!Cellular:*beep*October 16, 9:22 AMWright & Co. Law OfficesPhoenix:\n(Maya's here... watching television.)TV:\nNow for the morning news. The actor Will Powers was arrested yesterday. Powers plays the lead role in the popular kid's show \"The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo.\" He was arrested on suspicion of murder. The victim was Jack Hammer, who plays the villain known as the \"Evil Magistrate.\" His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. The \"Samurai Spear\" was also found stuck through the body. Police believe this was the murder weapon, and are investigating further.Phoenix:\n... This has to be a joke.Maya:\nNo, no, no! It's a nightmare! The Steel Samurai is over! The world is over!Cellular:\nBrrrrring... Brrrrring...*beep*Maya:\nYes... Wright & Co. Law Offices. ... What!? Nick!

Go where?Maya:\nThey have the Steel Samurai down in detention!Phoenix:\nSo what!?Maya:\nSo, I've decided this will be our first case!Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBookshelf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere's a horrendous amount of legal books here. Scarier still is the thought that I have to read all of these now.\n\n\n\n\nHouseplant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMia's favorite potted plant. Maya has been watering it so much lately it looks a little... swollen. She's either trying to make it grow... or she's perfecting her water torture technique.\n\n\n\n\nMovie poster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA poster of an old movie that Mia liked. I was thinking I should go see it myself. Then I realized that the poster doesn't actually say the title of the movie.\n\n\n\n\nDesk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMia's desk. Actually... it's my desk now. Sitting here always makes me feel like a professional.\n\n\n\n\nWindow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's a nice day outside. The hotel across the way is always full these days.

We have to get down to the detention center and meet the Steel Samurai!\nPhoenix:\n(Does she want to investigate this case or just do some sightseeing, I wonder? My money's on sightseeing.)\n\n\n\n\nAny ideas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nWe don't have enough information to make a case yet.\nPhoenix:\nJust admit it: you don't have a clue what happened.\nMaya:\nNo!

It's him! In the flesh!Maya:\nUmm... Is that guy really him?Phoenix:\nWhaddya mean \"that guy\"? Of course it's him! Will Powers, our client! That's him.Maya:\nUm, maybe I shouldn't be saying this... But he definitely did it. Murder. At least once. Maybe twice.Phoenix:\nWhoa whoa whoa! What are you saying!?Will:\nUmm...Maya:\nY-yes!?Will:\nSomething wrong...?Maya:\nN-no! No!Phoenix:\n(This is getting off to a great start.)Will:\nI know, I know. You're disappointed, aren't you?Maya:\nD-disappointed!? Oh, no. Oh no.Will:\nNo, it's okay. This is the real me. When I got the part of the Steel Samurai, with that mask... I decided I would never show my face in public until the job was over. It's the kids, you know. I didn't want to wreck their dreams.Maya:\nOh...Will:\nI guess it didn't matter. So much for dreams. I wonder what they think of the Steel Samurai now. *sniff* Uwaaah!Maya:\nNick!Phoenix:\nWhat?Maya:\nHe's a good guy! I mean, he's good!Phoenix:\nYeah.Maya:\nHe didn't do it!Phoenix:\n...Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecurity camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSmile for the camera...\n\n\n\n\nSecurity guard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room. He seems frozen in awe of Will Powers.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMaybe you could start by telling us what happened.\nWill:\nY-yes. Of course. It seems like it was only yesterday. Actually, it was only yesterday. The cast had come down to Global Studios for a run-through. We went through a few action sequences at 10:00 that morning. There was a rehearsal scheduled for 5:00 in the afternoon. But when 5:00 came around, and the staff gathered at the studio... The Evil Magistrate was found lying in a crumpled heap near the set. They took off his mask... And discovered that it was Jack Hammer... dead! He had been expertly skewered with the Samurai Spear.\nPhoenix:\nThe \"Samurai Spear\"...?\nWill:\nYes, it's a long spear that I... that the Steel Samurai uses as a weapon.\n\n\n\n\nThe Steel Samurai\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMaybe you could explain to me just what \"the Steel Samurai\" is.\nMaya:\nNick! How could you say such a thing? I-I'm sorry, sir, I apologize for my partner! He's new to this, and a bit OUT OF TOUCH with the world.\nPhoenix:\nHey! Who's \"new to this\"!?\nWill:\nNo, it's alright, really. The Steel Samurai is the lead character in a popular kid's show. He walks the streets of Neo Olde Tokyo... Fighting battle after battle against the Evil Magistrate and his minions. Of course, he never really defeats the Evil Magistrate. Although... I guess he did defeat him this time... *sniff* Uwaaah!\nPhoenix:\nI-I see. (Neo Olde Tokyo...? Who comes up with these names!?)\n\n\n\n\nPowers's alibi (appears after \"What happened\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nNow, where were you on the day of the murder?\nWill:\nWell, that morning I came to studios at 9:00. We worked through some action scenes until noon. Rehearsal was to begin at 5:00, but I was a little tired. So after lunch, I took a nap in my dressing room. When I woke up, it was after 5:00! I was late for the rehearsal! I hurried to the studio... and found everyone looking shocked. They arrested me on the spot, and brought me here.\nPhoenix:\n(So he was sleeping the entire afternoon of the murder? Some action hero!)\nWill:\nWhat will the kids think? *sniff*Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm, here.\nWill:\nI... I see. ...\nPhoenix:\n(Let me guess... this guy wasn't the top student in improv class.)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill:\nI-I'm sorry. I'm sure that's very important and all. I just don't see what it has to do with my problem.After clearing \"Powers's alibi\" Talk option:Phoenix:\nI think I should probably check out the scene of the murder...Will:\nRight... Global Studios. I'll draw you a map.Maya:\nWow! Nick! Let's go!Phoenix:\n(I'm willing to bet 10 bucks she asks for autographs.)Wright & Co.

The studio! We should go to the studio! I'm sure we could find some clues there!\nPhoenix:\n(Does she want to investigate this case or just do some sightseeing, I wonder? My money's on sightseeing.)October 16Global StudiosMain GateMaya:\nWow! So this is where they make the Steel Samurai show! Awesome! Aren't you excited!?Oldbag:\nHey! You there! You want in, you gotta go through me!Maya:\nO-oh... s-sorry! W-we're, um, lawyers.Oldbag:\nOh yeah? Well that's great. I'm security! And it's my job to make sure that gawkers like you stay OUT.Maya:\nG-gawkers?Oldbag:\nGawkers! Sightseers! Tourists!!! I know the type. You heard about the incident and came to snoop around. Youths today! Something horrible happens and all you can think of is sightseeing. Wasting your time at a place like this. Don't you have jobs you should be doing? Or do lawyers not work like the rest of us? Maybe I should become a lawyer too. Sounds like a life of ease to me no work just loafing around all day as you please. Well when I was young things were a mite different, mind you we didn't prance around in strange hippie clothes. What are the youths coming to these days my own son hasn't called in...Maya:\nUmm... Nick? Will I grow up to be like her? Please say \"no.\"Phoenix:\nI dunno! It's possible.Oldbag:\nHey! Listen when you're being spoken to! Youths today!Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe computer that runs the studio security cameras.\nOldbag:\nHey! No touching!\n\n\n\n\nGuard station\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe security guard station. That security lady must like junk food. There's a mountain of it on the desk in there. I can see the computer that runs the security cameras.\n\n\n\n\nMain gate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe main entrance to the studio. There was a big scene here yesterday with onlookers pressing up against the gate.\n\n\n\n\nStudio map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAn overhead map of the studios. Right from here is the Employee Area. To the left are the actual film studios.\n\n\n\n\nStudio van\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nLooks like a studio van. They probably use it to carry around film equipment.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe studios\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, what do you do here at the studios?\nOldbag:\nAt Global Studios, we make children's dreams come true! In fact, in my younger days...\nMaya:\nNo! You were a star!?\nOldbag:\nOnly a little twinkle between the stars here, I'm afraid, dearie.\nMaya:\nWo... wow.\nOldbag:\nThis place has really gone downhill, you know? But 10 years ago, now that was a studio of dreams! Hammer was a big star back then too, he was...\nPhoenix:\nHammer...?\nOldbag:\nThe victim, dummy! The Evil Magistrate! He's been reduced to playing villains now. Not exactly the best material to work with...\n\n\n\n\nWill Powers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nCan you tell me about Mr. Will Powers?\nOldbag:\nHe's not a bad kid, but don't be fooled by his mask! You wouldn't want him on the silver screen without it, believe me. Little old ladies watching would lose their lunch! That's probably why he thought that the Steel Samurai was his \"big chance.\" No one thought he was capable of doing what he did to poor Jack Hammer...\nMaya:\nWe don't know for certain that Will Powers is guilty!\nOldbag:\nPowers? Of course he's guilty! How do I know? I know everything! That's my job.\n\n\n\n\nMr. Hammer (appears after \"The studios\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of person was Jack Hammer?\nOldbag:\nWhat \"kind of person\"? Oh... if you only knew! Jack Hammer will live on in many hearts as the ultimate action hero! He was simply dashing in the Dynamite Samurai series!\nPhoenix:\n(Should I have heard of that...?)\nOldbag:\nBut... there was an accident during filming five years ago. He got an unlucky break after that. Reduced to playing the villain on a children's program! What's more, I heard they were paying him peanuts. It's enough to make you cry.\n\n\n\n\nReason for suspicion (appears after \"Will Powers\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy are you so certain Mr. Powers is the killer?\nOldbag:\nI was standing right here yesterday, I was. I was here from 1:00 in the afternoon, to 5:00, when they found the body! Now the studio where the murder took place is to the left here. So if you want to go to the studio, you have to pass by me! Only one person went by here between 1:00 and 2:30, when the murder took place!\nPhoenix:\nAnd... that person was Mr. Powers?\nOldbag:\nYes. I saw him!\nPhoenix:\nBut Mr. Powers says he was sleeping in his dressing room.\nOldbag:\nOh, I'm sure he would say that. He's no fool! But he was the only one that walked by. He's the killer, you can bet your biscuits on it.Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOldbag:\nWhat's that? You giving that to me?\nPhoenix:\n(Absolutely not!)After clearing all Talk options:Oldbag:\nIsn't it about time for you to be heading home? There's nothing to see here. Move along.Phoenix:\nUm, actually, we're here at Mr. Powers's request.Oldbag:\nHmph! I thought you were suspicious lookin'! Show me a \"letter of request.\" And maybe I'll just let you in.Maya:\nThis lady here thinks she owns this place, obviously.Detention CenterWill:\nHello! How was the studio? They all think I did it, don't they?Maya:\nN-no, not at all! Isn't that right, Nick?Phoenix:\nRight, not at all. At worst, you're a suspect.Will:\n*sniff*Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour alibi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. Powers, you aren't hiding anything from me, are you?\nWill:\nW-what? No! I'd never do that!\nPhoenix:\nJust now you said that you were sleeping in your dressing room after lunch.\nWill:\nYes. Like a baby.\nPhoenix:\nBut the security lady said she saw you that day. She says she saw you heading towards the scene of the crime!\nWill:\nW-what!? That's not possible! I... I really don't know what to say! I was sleeping, I promise!\nPhoenix:\nMr. Powers, if you want me to help you, you have to tell me the truth. I'm new to this lawyer business, and I need every advantage I can get.\nWill:\nI know... I-I'm sorry. *sniff* But, I swear to you on my momma's grave, I was sleeping. Maybe the security lady only thought she saw me?\nPhoenix:\n(What did she see...? He doesn't seem to be lying.)\n\n\n\n\nThe security lady\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUmm... about the security guard at the main gate to the studio...\nWill:\nOh, the security lady?\nMaya:\nShe's terrible! She called me \"suspicious lookin'\"!\nWill:\nY-yes... actually, she's said the same thing to me before. \"Take off that mask!\" were her words, I believe. She sucks up to all the bigwigs at the studio... But let her see you stumble once and she'll never let up on you.\nMaya:\nGrr! She's got some nerve!\nPhoenix:\nDo you think you could write up a letter formally requesting my representation?\nWill:\nOf c-course.\nPowers's Request added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\n(I just hope this will get me past that security lady.)\n\n\n\n\nThe security lady (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUmm... about the security guard at the main gate to the studio...\nWill:\nOh, the security lady?\nMaya:\nShe's terrible!

I saw him sipping tea and staring gloomily out the window!Phoenix:\nUmm... so?Maya:\nHey! If he's depressed, it's all your fault for doing sloppy detective work!Gumshoe:\n!!! ... ... ...Maya:\nUm, Detective?Phoenix:\nI think you hurt his feelings.Maya:\nOh no! I... I'm sorry!Phoenix:\nWell, I think his feelings are easily hurt.Gumshoe:\nYou're right, pal. It's all my fault. I can blame other people all I want, but I know the truth in my heart!Maya:\nHey, hey! Don't take it so hard! There's always the next case!Gumshoe:\nYeah, I suppose you're right. Hey! What exactly are you two doing here?Maya:\nUm, well... We're on this case too, pal!Gumshoe:\nHuh!? Hey! You can't just go saying \"pal\" like that! That's MY endearing character trait!Maya:\nI'd say he's a character alright...Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBench\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI'm a little bushed. Maybe I'll take a short rest here.\nGumshoe:\nHey, good idea, pal!\nMaya:\nDetective! Aren't you on the case?\nGumshoe:\nW-well, yeah, but... Hey, us detectives get tired of standing around too, pal!\n\n\n\n\nLeft path\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe, what's down the path to the left? It looks like a tree fell down over the path...?\nGumshoe:\nOh, yeah. That way's kind of dangerous. You should stay out, pal. There's nothing down there, anyway. That's where Studio Two used to be, they tell me. They don't use it now, though.\n\n\n\n\nStatue with broken head\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe studio mascot. I guess it's a monkey of some kind. But what kind of monkey has a nose like that? He's holding a sign in his hand. [Right: To Studio One; Left: To Studio Two]\nMaya:\nWhat's up with that thing!? It looks kind of... busted.\nGumshoe:\nOh, the wind was pretty strong yesterday, and the head broke off. It took that tree down with it, too.\n\n\n\n\nSecurity camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHey, there's a camera here.\nGumshoe:\nThat's the security camera. It takes photos of people going to the studio. All you have to do is look at the data and you can see who went where!\nPhoenix:\nThere's a number plate on the camera... [ST1-307]. That must be the camera ID number.\n\n\n\n\nStudio One entrance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.\nMaya:\nLet's go in and check it out, Nick! ... Hey! It's locked!\nPhoenix:\nLooks like you need a cardkey to get in. It makes sense that they would want to keep the non-employees out.\n\n\n\n\nWelcome sign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nThere's a big welcome sign above the path.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, apparently the studio's fallen on tough times. They've started letting people in on days they aren't filming. They make a bit of extra money by charging for admission.\nMaya:\nHuh. You sure know a lot about this place, Detective. You know, you could always quit being a detective and work here?\nPhoenix:\nYeah! And what perfect timing, with the monkey's neck broken and all.\nGumshoe:\nHuh? Just what's that supposed to mean, pal!?Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe investigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, how is your investigation going, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nWell, it's... Hey! I can't tell you that, pal.\nMaya:\nNick... Maybe you need to be a little more indirect with your questions?\nPhoenix:\nRight. So, Detective, mind if I take a look at what you got?\nGumshoe:\nWhat I got?\nPhoenix:\nThe autopsy report! The latest version, if you please...\nGumshoe:\nHmm... right, right. Sorry about what happened last time, pal.\nAutopsy Report added to the Court Record.\n\n\n\n\nThe investigation (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, how is your investigation going, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nI'm not at liberty to give you any more information, pal. You'll hear all you need to know in court!\nPhoenix:\n(Oh well, it was worth a try.)\n\n\n\n\nReason for arrest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy was Mr. Powers arrested?\nGumshoe:\nSimple, pal! The murder took place right over there in Studio One. Now, the victim entered Studio One at approximately 1:00 PM. At that time, there was no one other than the victim in the studio. According to the autopsy report, the time of death was 2:30 PM. Only one person went to the studio between 1:00 and 2:30! And that person was none other than Will Powers! No one else, pal! If you think I'm lying, ask the security lady at the main gate.\nMaya:\nNick! If that's true...! Anyone would think that Powers did it with that kind of evidence!\nPhoenix:\nThanks for cheering me up...\n\n\n\n\nThe security lady\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAbout the security lady...\nGumshoe:\nOh, that sweet old lady. What a charmer!\nPhoenix:\nHuh? A-are we talking about the same person?\nGumshoe:\nWhen I showed her my badge she gave me a donut and some coffee!\nMaya:\nRemember what Powers said. She's a sucker for authority.\nGumshoe:\nShe even gave me a piece of valuable evidence!\nMaya:\nWhaat!?\n\n\n\n\nDecisive evidence (appears after \"The security lady\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of evidence!?\nGumshoe:\nWell, that, er, photo. The photo of the Steel Samurai heading toward the scene of the crime!\nMaya:\nWhat! Who took that!?\nGumshoe:\nSee the camera up on that gate, pal?\nMaya:\nThe gate? You mean the one with the welcome sign?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. Whenever someone walks by, that camera automatically snaps a photo of them!\nMaya:\nOh no! Nick, he has evidence! We're finished!\nPhoenix:\n(Funny, for someone with hard proof he doesn't look too happy.)\nGumshoe:\n...Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nDetective, see this? This is my attorney's badge.\nGumshoe:\nUh huh? Don'tcha think it's a little sad when you have to explain what your badge means, pal? Real men show their P.D. badge and that's that!\nPhoenix:\nI'll admit the design of my badge leaves a lot to be desired...\nMaya:\nMaybe it should just be a big \"L\" for \"Lawyer\"?\nPhoenix:\nHmm... I'm not so sure about that.\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm, Detective. Any ideas about this?\nGumshoe:\nLook, I don't got time to look at every little trinket you got, okay pal?After clearing \"The investigation\" and \"Decisive evidence\" Talk options:Gumshoe:\nWhat's wrong, pal? You seem down.Phoenix:\nDon't look so happy when you say that.Gumshoe:\nOh hoh hoh hoh hoh!Maya:\nUmm... We'd like to ask the employees here some questions...Gumshoe:\nSure thing, pal. Go wherever you like. Of course, you're not going to find any clues I haven't already found! Hah hah hah!Phoenix:\n(I'm glad someone around here seems to be enjoying themselves.)Maya:\nNick, let's go! We've got a free pass to the place. Now's our chance to check things out!Studio - Main GateMaya:\nNick! Look! That security lady is in the guard station stuffing her face with donuts! I guess all cops like their donuts!Phoenix:\nYeah, and they're soft enough she doesn't need teeth to chew them...Oldbag:\nHey, you! Well? Are you satisfied Powers is guilty yet?Phoenix:\n(Urk! She had to make my life harder by giving that photo to Detective Gumshoe...)Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotographic proof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy didn't you tell us about the security photo, ma'am?\nOldbag:\nHmm? Oh, that? I just thought it would be more thrilling to talk with the detective himself! These things are important, you know. Oh, just to the left from here is the gate with the camera that took that photo. It's my job to check the photos every day, you see.\n\n\n\n\nReason for suspicion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOldbag:\nThis guard station is in a central position. No matter where you go here, you pass by my station first! Now poor Hammer, he went to the studio just before 1:00. The murder happened right around 2:30, see? The only one I seen go through here between 1:00 and 2:30 was Powers himself! The security camera got a good look at him too. If he's not the one what did it, I don't know who is!\nPhoenix:\nMaybe... it was you?\nOldbag:\nGyah hah ha hah! Good one, sonny.\nPhoenix:\n(She thinks I was joking.)\n\n\n\n\nMr. Hammer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWas the victim, Mr. Hammer, a popular actor?\nOldbag:\nOh, he was the biggest star in the studio!\nPhoenix:\n(\"Was\"? Past tense?)\nMaya:\nOh yes! He was great as the \"Bearded Samurai\"!\nOldbag:\nThat too, yes. He shone the brightest! Back in the day. Making a star like him play the \"Evil Magistrate\"... It's a disgrace, I tell you! Hammer took it pretty hard, and who can blame him?\n\n\n\n\nAutomatic camera (appears after \"Photographic proof\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAbout the security camera...\nOldbag:\nOh yes, the camera. It's automatic. It can tell when someone walks through that gate, see? Then it snaps a photo! Apparently, it records the time when it takes a picture too. But I don't bother myself with those details. I just view all the photos on the computer over in the security guard station. I check 'em every day before going home, I do.October 16Wright & Co. Law OfficesMaya:\nWhat's going on, Nick!? Powers said he was sleeping in his dressing room! But now there's a photo of him going to the studio!?Phoenix:\nDon't look at me! How should I know?Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to do\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you think?\nMaya:\nThat photo the detective was talking about is the problem here.\nPhoenix:\nWell, that's hard to say, without seeing the actual photo ourselves. But if it is Powers in that photo, his alibi is shot.\n\n\n\n\nPhotographic proof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOnly one person went to the scene of the crime before the murder took place. And there's a photograph to prove it.\nMaya:\nI guess it makes sense that that person is the killer then. What do we do, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nMaybe there was someone else who could have gone to the scene other than Powers? Let's take a look. Maybe that security lady missed someone?\nMaya:\nOn thing's for sure, if there are any clues, they'll be in that studio.October 16Detention CenterVisitor's RoomPhoenix:\n...Maya:\nApparently they have Mr. Powers in questioning.Phoenix:\nHmm... right.Gumshoe:\nLook pal, that camera takes a picture automatically whenever someone walks by.

Let's try again later.Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecurity guard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room. He must get pretty bored.

No one's here this soon after the murder I guess. Let's take a look around!Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBicycle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nLooks like one of those electric-powered bicycles. I dunno about these.

That's a pretty big drain. A kid could fit through there, I bet.\nMaya:\nYeah, if you snuck in that way you wouldn't have to pay at the gate!\nPhoenix:\nWell, if you want to leave that way, be my guest.\nMaya:\nRight! Huh? Hey! I'm not a kid!\n\n\n\n\nGrate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe grate that used to cover the drain. It's a little bent. I don't think it would fit if I tried to put it back on.\n\n\n\n\nLunch table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe remains of yesterday's lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak.\nMaya:\nMmm! T-bone steak! That would have hit the spot.\nPhoenix:\nYou just had a burger!\nMaya:\nYeah, but I have a second stomach just for steaks.\nPhoenix:\n(What!?)\n\n\n\n\nStage backdrop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere's a half-finished backdrop for a stage here.

Let's take a look inside! Maybe we can find something as a souvenir...?\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you mean \"find\"!?\nMaya:\nYou never know! There might be something like... the Samurai Spear!\nPhoenix:\nWe don't need a spear! (And that's the murder weapon for crying out loud!)\n\n\n\n\nDressing room sign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere's a sign on the dressing room door. \"Mr. Will Powers\"... it must be neat to be the star and have your own room like this.\n\n\n\n\nDressing room window\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA window into the dressing room.

The assistant holds it during filming.\nMaya:\nHuh.\nPhoenix:\nWhat? Where's your enthusiasm for all things entertainment?\nMaya:\nWell, lighting is fine, but I'd want to be the director.

(Changed from [Yes, well, the studios aren't doing so well right now.] in the original release) And yesterday was only rehearsal for our action sequences.\nMaya:\nOh, I see. (Changed from [I see. Neat!] in the original release)\nPenny:\nIn the morning we went through the action sequences in the employee area. WP and Hammer were there, along with everyone else.\nPhoenix:\nThe employee area--that's where Powers's dressing room is, right?\nPenny:\nYes, that's the place.

The only thing we had scheduled was an action scene run-through. I was the only assistant here that day.

Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution will show the court that at 2:30 PM on October 15, the defendant, Mr. Will Powers, killed fellow actor Jack Hammer at Studio One of Global Studios. It is impossible for anyone else to have committed this heinous crime. The evidence presented during the trial will all point to this fact.Judge:\nHmm. I see. Very well, I would like to move on to your testimony. Mr. Edgeworth, the prosecution may call its first witness.Edgeworth:\nVery well, I call a most familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand. (Changed from [First, I would like to call a familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand.] in the original release)Edgeworth:\nDetective, if you would briefly describe this case to the court?Gumshoe:\nYes sir! I'll explain with the guidemap here. To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see? This here is the Employee Area. The actors did a run-through of their action scenes during the morning here. This is the main gate to the studios. The security lady that works at the studios was here at 1:00 PM on that day. Past the security station there is a gate, see? Past that are the studios. And here it is... Studio One. This is the scene of the murder, where the body was found! Now, on the day of the murder, October 15, there were only three people here. The victim, Jack Hammer, the defendant, Will Powers, and a young woman, the production assistant. All the production staff were in the Employee Area until noon. Then after lunch, the victim, Jack Hammer, went to Studio One. Right after that, at 1:00 PM, the security lady got to the guard station. Now, jump ahead to later that day... 5:00 PM. The production staff came to Studio One to perform a rehearsal. Needless to say, the rehearsal was cancelled... The time of death was 2:30 PM. The \"Samurai Spear\" found lodged in the victim's chest was the murder weapon. That's the case, in brief. Anyone like to hear that again?Phoenix:\n(Hmm... should I listen to that whole thing again...?)Skip it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"I think I can probably remember that...\"Listen again\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry, could you describe that one more time?\nGumshoe:\nI shoulda known it would be you, pal!

This case is quite simple if you ask one question: And that question is: \"What did the security lady at the guard station see?\"Judge:\nUnderstood.Edgeworth:\nLet's call this security officer to the stand!Edgeworth:\nWill the witness declare her name?Oldbag:\n... Hmm? My, aren't you a handsome fellow! I'm afraid I'm a bit flustered!Edgeworth:\nY-your name, please!Oldbag:\nOh, dearie! No need for you to be embarrassed! Just call me \"grandma.\"Edgeworth:\nYOUR NAME, PLEASE!Phoenix:\n(Seems Edgeworth has a bit of trouble getting his witnesses to say their names...)Oldbag:\nWendy Oldbag, dearie. So just call me \"grandma.\" It's practically my name! So even when I was young I was an Oldbag, but not really that was just my name dearie. Still how the other children would make fun of me and just because of my name can you believe it? But there was this boy, the captain of the chess club in junior high, and when he called me an old bag well I just cried and cried because I had a crush on him you see--Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nO-objection! I... object to the witness's talkativeness.Judge:\nObjection sustained! The witness will refrain from rambling on the stand.Oldbag:\nI was just getting to the good part, dearie!Edgeworth:\nPerhaps we can get to the testimony?Judge:\nNow, the witness was stationed at the main gate on the day of the murder, correct?Oldbag:\nYessey I was.Judge:\nAnd to get to the scene of the murder, someone would have to pass by you?Oldbag:\nYou know your stuff, dearie!Judge:\n... You may begin your testimony.Phoenix:\n(She sure is one hell of an Oldbag...)Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Oldbag:\nOn the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.\nPoor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.\nI, well, I had some errands to run that morning.\nAnyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.\nI was at the main gate from then until 5:00!\nNow, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?\nInteresting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.\nIt was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!Judge:\nYou saw the defendant, then? Hmm... Very well. Let's begin the cross-examination. Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.Cross Examination-- Witness's Account --Oldbag:\nOn the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo up until that time, anyone who wanted to could go into the studio?\nOldbag:\nWell, there wasn't a security guard at the gate, no. But the main gate was locked, dearie. You'd need an employee cardkey to get in.\nPhoenix:\n(Right... the cardkey that I have. So, what she's saying is no one who wasn't supposed to be there could get in.)\nEdgeworth:\nWas there anyone at the studios when you arrived at the guard station?Oldbag:\nPoor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nA \"run-through\"...?\nOldbag:\nThey were working out a scene between the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate. They got the basics figured out by noon, and were to use the afternoon for practice. Rehearsal was supposed to start at 5:00. That's why poor old Hammer went to Studio One in the afternoon.\nPhoenix:\n(So Powers was in his dressing room sleeping... when he was supposed to be practicing! Talk about a laid-back hero...)\nEdgeworth:\nIf there was a run-through in the morning, why did you only get there after noon?Oldbag:\nI, well, I had some errands to run that morning.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of \"errands\"?\nOldbag:\nOh, well, you know.\nPhoenix:\nAnswer the question!\nOldbag:\nActually... I was watching poor Hammer and Powers. Observing, you know?\nPhoenix:\nO-observing? Weren't you supposed to be at the guard station?\nOldbag:\nWhippersnapper! I told you I locked the gate, didn't I? I did my job!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not sure your boss would see it that way...)\nOldbag:\nAnyway! I always watch Hammer's run-throughts. Always! Never missed one in all my years.\nMaya:\nWow! I want to see a Steel Samurai run-through too!\nPhoenix:\nYou could quit being a spirit medium and take up guard duty.\nMaya:\nNot a bad idea...Oldbag:\nAnyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid you see the victim then?\nOldbag:\nDid I see poor old Hammer? Nope. He'd already gone to the studio before I got back to the guard station.\nEdgeworth:\nTell us what happened next.Oldbag:\nI was at the main gate from then until 5:00!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you were watching there the WHOLE time? No breaks? Not even a second?\nOldbag:\nO-of course! I am a professional, you know! Our are you criticizing how I do my job!? Whippersnapper!\nPhoenix:\nNo, it's just, after seeing you eating those donuts in the guard station yesterday...\nOldbag:\nI can watch the gate and eat donuts at the same time! Snipperwhapper!\nMaya:\n\"Snipperwhapper\"...? Old windbag is losing it, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWhy don't you raise an objection?\nJudge:\nSo, the witness was on duty through the afternoon, the whole time. Very well. What did you see?Oldbag:\nNow, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow did you know that?\nOldbag:\nOh hoh hoh. I have my ways! That over-dressed young detective told me. I fed him some donuts and he talked and talked... If you ask me, that detective isn't cut out for his job.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Detective Gumshoe, getting chewed out by a security guard...)Oldbag:\nInteresting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n2:00? You're sure?\nOldbag:\nSure as spit!\nJudge:\nWell, who was the man!?\nOldbag:\nReally, you should try not to get so excited at your age. You might strain something.\nJudge:\n...\nOldbag:\nNow, now, don't get your skivvies all in a bunch. I'll tell you who it was!Present Powers's(?)

Got wax in your ears, sonny?\nMaya:\nNick, this is your chance!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, time to pull out the secret weapon...\nOldbag:\nI'll say it again! It was him!Present Powers's(?)

Can't she get her kicks somewhere else?Phoenix:\nLet me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag! You've been saying since yesterday that you \"saw Mr. Powers,\" correct? But you're talking about the man in this photo, aren't you!Judge:\nJ-just a moment, Mr. Wright. Let me see that photo! ... What is this, exactly?Phoenix:\nNone other than the Steel Samurai, defender of Neo Olde Tokyo. Ms. Oldbag! Is this the \"Mr. Powers\" that you saw!?Oldbag:\nOf course! Didn't your momma teach you any sense, sonny? Anyone can plainly see that's Powers! Right?Edgeworth:\nNo, they can't! (Changed from [Um, yeah.] in the original release) ... Umm... well. I mean, I wonder? (Changed from [Umm... well. I wonder?] in the original release)Phoenix:\nTrue, Mr. Powers does play the role of the Steel Samurai! But that doesn't mean Mr. Powers IS the Steel Samurai!Oldbag:\n...! I... I know that! I wasn't born yesterday!Judge:\nNo one in this court is accusing you of that, Ms... er, witness.Phoenix:\n(He's having trouble calling her \"Oldbag\" apparently...)Judge:\nHowever, you do not have proof that the person in this photo is Mr. Will Powers, do you?Oldbag:\nHumph! Nosy old man! Of course I have proof!Phoenix:\nWhat!?Edgeworth:\nHuh!?Phoenix:\n(Even Edgeworth is surprised!?)Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution would like to ask the old... the witness. Please make known all the information in your possession ahead of time!Oldbag:\nHow was I to know everyone would be so nosy! You should be ashamed, all of you! Anyway, I showed that photo to the young detective. He told me \"this isn't any good as evidence, pal.\" He didn't even give it a second look!Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\n(Wow, old windbag has left even Edgeworth speechless. She's good!)Judge:\nLet's hear about your proof, then.Witness Testimony-- The Man in the Photo --Oldbag:\nI never say anything I don't mean, mind you!\nThat morning, during the run-through of the action scene...\nI saw Powers trip and fall!\nHe broke one of the props, it was a big mess.\nApparently, he sprained his ankle pretty bad.\nNow, look at that picture!\nYou can see he's dragging his leg! See? Clear as day!\nThat's how I knew it was Powers. Happy?Judge:\nHmm. So he had sprained his ankle...? Very well. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Phoenix:\n(She's got to be hiding something... I'll press her until she squeals.)Cross Examination-- The Man in the Photo --Oldbag:\nI never say anything I don't mean, mind you!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nOldbag:\nWhippersnapper!\nPhoenix:\n(Hey, I haven't said anything yet!)\nOldbag:\nI'll have you know I'm not pointing fingers at anyone behind their backs! Everything I've said is on the straight and narrow! The up and up! Youth today! Always whining about each other, pointing fingers this way and that! It's enough to make an old lady want to cry...\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Wright! Please, for all our sakes, try not to upset the witness!\nPhoenix:\n(I think Edgeworth has met his match...)Oldbag:\nThat morning, during the run-through of the action scene...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWho was present at the run-through?\nOldbag:\nWell, let's see... There was Powers, he's the Steel Samurai... Then poor old Hammer, the Evil Magistrate. And... me.\nJudge:\nAnd what exactly were you doing?\nOldbag:\nObserving! Just... observing.\nPhoenix:\nWhat about the assistant?\nOldbag:\nOh, she was off moving backdrops around and such.\nPhoenix:\n(So she didn't see the run-through, then...)Oldbag:\nI saw Powers trip and fall!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Trip and fall\"...?\nOldbag:\nYes! And to think, he's supposed to be the Steel Samurai! What a laugh! So Powers sprained his ankle. I helped make it better for him, of course.\nJudge:\nYou... helped make it better?\nOldbag:\nI kissed it where it hurt.\nJudge:\nL-let's just skip over that part, shall we?\nPhoenix:\nWhere was the assistant then?\nOldbag:\nOh, her? She was cleaning up backdrops, I think. She didn't know about Powers's ankle.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm...)\nEdgeworth:\nYou may continue your testimony.Oldbag:\nHe broke one of the props, it was a big mess.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe broke a prop?\nOldbag:\nSure did!

He went to his dressing room to rest up after lunch.\nPhoenix:\n(Thus the nap...)\nOldbag:\nAnyway, I saw him dragging his foot when he walked.\nPhoenix:\n(Dragging his foot... okay.)Oldbag:\nYou can see he's dragging his leg! See? Clear as day!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely sure? (Let's take a look at that picture again... Hmm... so he was walking strangely because he was injured...)\nJudge:\nHmm. It does look like he was dragging his foot.\nOldbag:\nSee! And you didn't trust me! Whippersnapper!Oldbag:\nThat's how I knew it was Powers. Happy?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nStill, you can't look at this and say it's Mr. Powers!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYes, but only Mr. Powers would have been dragging his leg!\nJudge:\nHe has a point. It does seem quite likely that it was Powers.\nPhoenix:\n(There's got to be more to this. I'd better keep pressing her.)Maya:\nWell, Nick? Find any glaring contradictions?Phoenix:\nWell, she seems pretty sure that was Powers in that photo... I guess I'll just press her and see if I can shake her conviction...After pressing second or third statement, then pressing fourth statement:Edgeworth:\nI think we've heard enough! Haven't we, Your Honor?Judge:\nWell, there is one thing that bothers me.Edgeworth:\nWhich is?Judge:\nWhere is this \"Steel Samurai\" costume now?Edgeworth:\nUmm... hmm. Actually, well... We couldn't find it. We're looking, though.Judge:\nHmm...Edgeworth:\nAnyway, that's not important! The witness did see the Steel Samurai, yes. And it is clear that the person in the Steel Samurai suit was Mr. Will Powers!Judge:\nHmm... I suppose that's right.Phoenix:\n(Are you sure you're sure, Your Honor?)Object\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHold it right there! We keep talking possibilities, but we have to agree that this photo shows the Steel Samurai! Nowhere in this photo can we see Mr. Will Powers!\nJudge:\nHmm... The defense has a point. I also wonder if someone else not caught on camera could have killed Mr. Hammer. We have to consider that possibility, also.\nEdgeworth:\nThen allow me to remove that doubt from your mind, Your Honor...\nLeads to:\n\"Will the witness continue her testimony, please?\"Wait and see what happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I think I'll wait and see where this goes.)\nJudge:\nI suppose, since there weren't any additional crew members at the studios that day... It's quite likely that it was the defendant inside that costume. I see no problem with this evidence.\nEdgeworth:\nMost perceptive, Your Honor!\nPhoenix:\n(He still doesn't seem that convinced to me... I hope.)\nLeads to:\n\"Will the witness continue her testimony, please?\"Edgeworth:\nWill the witness continue her testimony, please?Oldbag:\nNo need to ask twice!Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account, cont. --Oldbag:\nThe time of poor Hammer's death was 2:30 PM, true?\nThe only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers!\nNo one else went there!\nIf they had, I would have seen them!Judge:\nHmm... So, if no one else went to the studio... Then it would have to be this \"Steel Samurai\" who did it.

This photo was taken by the camera at the gate for the studios, correct?Oldbag:\nYesiree, sonny.Phoenix:\nSo, whenever anyone passes by here, it automatically takes a picture?Oldbag:\nAnd here I thought you didn't know your head from a hole in the ground.Phoenix:\nRight... Anyway! It's also true that the computer in the guard station records all security cam data.Oldbag:\nOoh! You know, if you wanted to work at the studio, we might have an opening.Phoenix:\nThat very computer printed out this photo. Note that on the back of the photo are printed the words: [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2]Oldbag:\nEven I know that means it was taken at 2:00 PM on October the 15th! Really, sonny!Phoenix:\nActually, I knew that too. The issure here is the bit at the end where it says: \"Photo #2\"...Oldbag:\n\"Photo #2\"...?Phoenix:\nThe computer only held data for one photo on that day. Don't you think that's odd? Shouldn't this photo be \"Photo #1\" if it really was the ONLY photo!?Judge:\nOrder! Order! Please tell the court what you mean by this, Mr. Wright!Phoenix:\nActually, that's what I want to ask the witness. This evidence shows that not one, but two people went to the studio that day. Yet there is only data for one of the photos! Who could have erased the data for the other photo? Only someone with access-- the security lady herself! (Changed from [Only someone with access... the security lady herself!] in the original release)Oldbag:\nEh!? You watch your mouth, whippersnapper! The only person I saw that day was Will Powers!Phoenix:\nBut the camera on the gate fired twice! That means two people went by!Oldbag:\nUmm... well, yes... that's what it would seem to mean...Judge:\nCan the witness explain this to the court?Oldbag:\nUmm... ahem. I-I don't understand these new-fangled computer things... Umm... E-Edgey-boy! Help!Edgeworth:\nHuh!? B-believe me, I want to, but I don't know what this means either.Oldbag:\nHumph!

Might be a useful tactic to remember for use in my future career as a windbag.Phoenix:\n(Let's find out more about this \"erased\" photo.)Phoenix:\nWell, who in the heck was in that photo you erased!?Oldbag:\nHumph. A fanboy.Phoenix:\nF-fanboy?Oldbag:\nSteel Samurai fanboys. Real freaks, if you ask me. They get information about the rehearsals from gosh-knows-where. They're always hanging about. One was there that day.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nW-wait a second! Didn't you just say no one else could get in!? \"I locked the main gate so no one could get in\"... Those were your words!Oldbag:\nWell! If you must know, there's a drain that goes into the Employee Area. The grate has been loose for a while. It leads outside, and well, that's where they come in.Phoenix:\nThey come in through the drain?Oldbag:\nI told you they were freaks. Oh, and...Phoenix:\nAnd...?Oldbag:\nThey're kids. Children. Whippersnappers.Phoenix:\nK-kids!? So, on the photo that you erased...?Oldbag:\nIt was a boy. Probably 2nd or 3rd grade.Phoenix:\nWhaaaaaaaaaaaat!?Judge:\nO-order! Order! Let me get this straight. You saw two people pass by the gate on their way to the studios that day? One was the Steel Samurai, dragging his leg. The other was a boy who looked to be in about 2nd or 3rd grade?Oldbag:\nOh yes, well we see his type there every day. Can't stop 'em. Can't catch 'em.Edgeworth:\nA boy in 2nd or 3rd grade? Hmm... I assume it would be hard, if not impossible for a young boy to wield the Samurai Spear?Judge:\nImpossible, I'd think. It's quite heavy.Oldbag:\nRight! As I said, I didn't pay him much mind. That's why I erased the data.Maya:\nUm, Nick? What's going on? I mean, the boy was there, that makes him a suspect!Phoenix:\nYeah, and they're already trying to \"un-suspect\" him.Judge:\nThis court will take a five-minute recess.

You didn't go to the studio?Will:\nI-I didn't go to the studio! I was s-sleeping, honest.Maya:\nSo who was the \"Steel Samurai\" in that security photo?Will:\nHow should I know? The Steel Samurai costume was off in the corner of the dressing room. Anyone could have walked in and taken it, really.Maya:\nWhat!? You should take better care of that stuff!Will:\nI couldn't imagine anyone would want to steal a Steel Samurai costume! So... where does this leave me?Phoenix:\nIt doesn't look good...Will:\n*sniff*Phoenix:\nYou're the only likely suspect, right now.Maya:\nNick! W-what are we going to do!?Phoenix:\nFirst, we play for more time. We'll start targeting someone else that could conceivably have done this!Maya:\nRight! And it'll take them so long to shoot us down that we can get another day!Phoenix:\nRight... but if we pick the wrong person, we might lose on the spot.Will:\nYou... don't sound very optimistic.Phoenix:\nI'm not optimistic at all, actually.Maya:\nHey, Nick. It's time.Phoenix:\nOkay. Let's go. *sigh*Will:\nWhat does that mean... Please don't sigh like that! *sniff*Judge:\nCourt will now reconvene for the trial of Mr. Will Powers. (Changed from [The court will now reconvene for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.] in the original release) Mr. Edgeworth, will you present the prosecution's thoughts on this matter?Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution's thoughts are simple. Nothing has changed. The other person who went to the studios was a boy of roughly 10 years of age. The photo we do have may not be hard evidence... But there is still no one else that could have committed this crime! I call for a verdict of \"guilty\" for the defendant, Mr. Will Powers!Judge:\nHmm... Very well. Mr. Wright, your thoughts?Phoenix:\nThe defense disagrees with the prosecution's claim. There IS another person who could have committed this crime!Judge:\nOrder! Interesting... Let us hear who you have in mind! However... Be aware that this court does not look kindly on accusing the innocent. If you accuse someone who is obviously innocent, you will be penalized.Phoenix:\n(Right. Great. As if the stakes weren't high enough.)Judge:\nSo, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder?The assistant girl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt was the assistant! The Steel Samurai costume was in his dressing room. She stole it, and in doing so she became the Steel Samurai!\nJudge:\nSo you're saying the Steel Samurai in the picture is really the assistant?\nPhoenix:\nThat's correct, Your Honor!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nIf you're serious, you've got guts, Mr. Wright. Remember the photo? Wasn't the Steel Samurai a little lame!? He was dragging his foot!\nPhoenix:\nOh. (Uh oh. Bad feeling time.)\nEdgeworth:\nRemember the testimony concerning Powers's injury!!!\n\n\nOldbag:\nPowers and poor Hammer were at the run-through. Oh, and me.\nPhoenix:\nWhat about the assistant?\nOldbag:\nOh, her? She was cleaning up backdrops, I think. She didn't know about Powers's ankle.\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe assistant knew nothing of Mr. Power's injury! She could look the Steel Samurai look with that costume... But she couldn't walk the the Steel Samurai walk! She wouldn't have limped!\nPhoenix:\nUngh!\nMaya:\nThat kind of takes the legs out from under that case...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. I'm afraid I have to penalize you, as I warned.\nPhoenix:\n(Nobody knows... the trouble I've seen...)\nJudge:\nMay we move on, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(Grr... this fight isn't over yet!) If you would, Your Honor, one more chance, please.\nJudge:\nVery well. Go ahead.\nLeads back to:\n\"So, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder?\"The grade-school boy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt was the grade-school boy! ... ... ... Why isn't anyone saying anything?\nEdgeworth:\nBah! Are you seriously suggesting the boy did it, Mr. Wright!? \"Grade-school boy kills veteran action star with spear!\" For one thing, it was the Steel Samurai holding the murder weapon. Would you care to explain just how the boy was involved?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... maybe that was a dumb move on my part.)\nMaya:\n\"Maybe\"? \"Maybe\"!? How about \"absolutely,\" Nick!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. I'm afraid I have to penalize you, as I warned.\nPhoenix:\n(Nobody knows... the trouble I've seen...)\nJudge:\nMay we move on, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(Grr... this fight isn't over yet!) If you would, Your Honor, one more chance, please.\nJudge:\nVery well. Go ahead.\nLeads back to:\n\"So, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder?\"The security lady\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"It was the security lady! Wendy Oldbag!\"Phoenix:\nIt was the security lady! Wendy Oldbag!Oldbag:\nW-who!?Phoenix:\nThe Steel Samurai is dragging his leg in this picture. That means whoever was in the suit knew about that morning's injury. Maybe because... they had been watching the action scene run-through! There was only one person other than Powers and Hammer who knew about the injury. The security lady, Oldbag!Oldbag:\nW-what!? Whippersnapper!Judge:\nOrder! Order! I-is this true, Oldbag!?Oldbag:\nOldbag!? That's Ms. Oldbag to you!Phoenix:\nMs. Oldbag was standing guard alone at the main gate. She was by herself... in other words, she has no alibi! She could have briefly left her post to steal the the Steel Samurai costume... Then slipped into Studio One, the scene of the murder!Judge:\nW-why would she go through the trouble of wearing the Steel Samurai costume!?Phoenix:\nSimple, Your Honor. She knew the camera at the gate would take her picture. If she was in his costume, she could point the finger at Mr. Powers!Judge:\nI see! Excellent deductive reasoning, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\n(Ohhh yeah, right here! Sherlock Holmes II, baby!) ...? (That's odd. Isn't this the part where Edgeworth pounces...? Doesn't he usually jump up with an objection and some new damning evidence...?)Judge:\nWell, Mr. Edgeworth? Does the prosecution have an opinion on this matter?Edgeworth:\n... The prosecution has no meaningful objections at this time.Oldbag:\nW-w-what!? What's that supposed to mean!? Oh, so you all think I did it? Is that it!? Edgey-boy! Don't just sit there, do something!Phoenix:\n(What's my move? Maybe now's my chance to take this the whole way?)Press further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case...\"Give granny a break\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I guess this does kind of make it look like she's the killer. Funny, I feel bad for her all of a sudden.)\nJudge:\nHmm... It's true that the witness could conceivably have committed this crime. Yet we must not forget that the victim was an action hero. As formidable as her personality may be, I doubt she'd be strong enough.\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh! If he removes her from consideration, that means Mr. Powers is it! Sorry, windbag... but I don't have a choice.)\nLeads to:\n\"The very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case...\"Phoenix:\nThe very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case... can be used to cast doubt on Ms. Oldbag's actions on that day!Oldbag:\nB-but why would I do something so horrible to poor Hammer!?Phoenix:\nYou forget that Mr. Powers lacks a clear motive, too.Judge:\nHmm... Indeed.Phoenix:\n(That did it. Now windbag is one of the suspects. No hard feelings... I hope.)Oldbag:\nWait just a minute! What about the other person who went to the studio!? The boy! The one whose photo I erased!Judge:\nHe's only a grade schooler though, as you said. 2nd or 3rd grade, was it?Oldbag:\nTh-that doesn't matter! When I was that age, I could pin my old man in 10 seconds, tops!Judge:\nHmm... Your thoughts, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nThat boy is not the killer.Oldbag:\nWhat!? How can you be so sure! Oh, or is it be nice to the kids and mean to your elders day? Whippersnapper!Phoenix:\nI have proof.Oldbag:\nP-proof!?Judge:\nIndeed? Then let's see this proof, Mr. Wright. You have proof that shows the boy could not have committed this murder?Present Cardkey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe scene of the murder, as we all know, was Studio One. However, you need a cardkey to enter Studio One! How could a boy with no formal relation to the studios have a cardkey!?\nLeads to:\n\"I see!\"Present Powers's(?) Photo or Samurai Spear\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! The murder weapon was the Samurai Spear. That very spear is shown here in this photo. How could the boy have taken the spear? It's impossible!\nLeads to:\n\"I see!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThis is my proof!\nJudge:\n... I can't see how that has anything to do with this matter, Mr. Wright?

Please try not to pick the wrong ones!\nPhoenix:\nS-sorry, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nI'll ask again, Mr. Wright.\nLeads back to:\n\"You have proof that shows the boy could not have committed this murder?\"Judge:\nI see!

He's probably up to his neck in paperwork after the commotion at today's trial.Maya:\nSo, Nick... Remember that \"Studio Two\" we heard about at the trial today? It was down that path with the fallen tree, right?Phoenix:\nYeah, I think that's what they said.Maya:\nMaybe the director and the rest of them are there today? Now's our chance, Nick! Let's check it out!Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBench\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI'm bushed.

The monkey head is in the way, but we should be able to get by it without a problem.\nMaya:\nThis monkey head is real heavy!\nPhoenix:\nWell, it did knock that tree over when it fell.\nMaya:\nBoth of these, the monkey head and the tree, fell the day of the murder, didn't they.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, that's what Detective Gumshoe said.\n\n\n\n\nStatue with broken head\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe studio mascot. Apparently it's a monkey of some kind. I've never seen a monkey with a nose like that before!\nMaya:\nWhy don't they put his head back on? Maybe we should ask that assistant?\nPhoenix:\nI'm not sure we really want her fixing anything. And you'd probably need a crane to move that thing.\nMaya:\nProbably so.\n\n\n\n\nSecurity camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThat's the security camera that automatically takes pictures of people here.

Or maybe the Steel Samurai!\nPhoenix:\n(I think she's being serious...!)\n\n\n\n\nStage backdrop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nLooks like a backdrop for a stage.

Though it doesn't look anything like a studio.\n\n\n\n\nStudio van\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA light van for moving staff and equipment around. They've kept it in pretty good shape.

Great job, guys!Phoenix:\nOh? Oh hoh hoh. Don't mention it.Penny:\nIs it true they caught the security lady!?Phoenix:\nOh! Oh... oh hoh hoh!Penny:\nActually, she just called me. She told me to cover up that drain...Phoenix:\nYou mean that one? (Wow, what a mess...)Penny:\nI... I know... I'm not so good with handiwork. Some assistant, right?Maya:\nYeah, but you do work on the props, and the backdrops, right?Penny:\nR-right. Just... lots of times they end up looking worse than they did before I fixed them.Maya:\nOh? Oh! Well, I'm sure these things happen. Nothing to worry yourself about!Penny:\nYou're right! I won't!Phoenix:\n(Personally, I think she should worry at least a little bit more...)Penny:\nUm, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to the guard station. I'm supposed to fill in for Ms. Oldbag.Maya:\nRight! See you later, then!Penny:\nGood luck with your investigation.Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaped cardboard barrier\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nSo, the fanboy they were talking about in the trial today... He came in through that drain?\nPhoenix:\nSo it seems. I guess they covered it up in a hurry.\nMaya:\nHey... Hey, Nick! If that drain's covered, the boy won't be able to get in.\nPhoenix:\nUh, yeah. I think that was the idea...?\nMaya:\nI feel kinda sorry for him, though. Don't you?\nPhoenix:\nWhat, you want to rip the grate off?\nMaya:\nReally, Nick? We can!?\nPhoenix:\n(Whoa... she's serious? Uh oh...)\n\n\n\nRip it open\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, I guess some things are just made to be broken.\nMaya:\nYay! You know, Nick, you're pretty swell sometimes.\nPhoenix:\n(Sometimes...?)\nMaya:\nHiii-ya! There. That should make the kids happy.\nPhoenix:\nThe things we do...\nLeads back to examination\n\n\n\n\nLeave it be\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nNah, I think we should leave it on. They only just repaired it. And if we take it off, that assistant will get yelled at by you-know-who.\nMaya:\nYeah... I guess so.\nPhoenix:\n(Wow!

Doesn't it make you feel great to do a good deed like that?\nPhoenix:\n(Must be nice to live so free of guilt.)\n\n\n\n\nLunch table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe remains of yesterday's lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak.\n\n\n\n\nDressing room door\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe door to the dressing room.

There's a difference.\n\n\n\n\nVending machine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nLet's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks or something.

Oh, too bad, it's sold out.October 18Global StudiosDressing RoomMaya:\nThis is where the Steel Samurai costume was, on the day of the murder.Phoenix:\nThat's what Mr. Powers says, at least. I guess they snuck in and took it while he was sleeping.Maya:\nBut Nick, what if Mr. Powers hadn't been sleeping? I wonder what the killer was planning on doing then?Phoenix:\nHuh... (She's got a point!)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCosmetics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere's an array of cosmetics here.

Get with the picture!\nPhoenix:\nLook, explain to me how you can identify a show just by seeing a wig!?\nMaya:\nI, um, kinda like samurai movies.\nPhoenix:\n(\"Kinda\"...?)\n\n\n\n\nCostume rack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere's some regular suits in among the costumes here. Those must be Mr. Powers's personal clothes.\n\n\n\n\nCouch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nLooks like someone was sleeping here. Maybe Powers did take a nap here, like he said.\n\n\n\n\nBag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nMr. Powers's bag. I wonder what's inside? Hey! Supermarket tabloids? Wow. I'm kind of shocked.\nPhoenix:\nMaya! Leave those alone! (Wolf Men Found On Mars...? I'll have to buy that issue!)\n\n\n\n\nTable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Some tea and cookies...\nMaya:\nWait... Nick!\nPhoenix:\nW-what now?\nMaya:\nThese snacks... they've passed the expiration date!\nPhoenix:\n... Then don't eat them.\nMaya:\n*grumble* (They're snacks! They're meant to be eaten!)\n\n\n\n\nWindow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's locked. I guess he doesn't open his window much.

You look a little out of place.Penny:\nIt's the clothes, isn't it? I thought my camo vest might do the trick... Kind of an \"alternative guard fashion\" thing.Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuard station\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe security guard station. I can see the computer that runs the security cameras.\nPenny:\nOh, please don't touch anything in there. The security lady would knock the stuffing out of me if she knew.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe studios\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, how are the studios doing?\nPenny:\nThere's police wandering around everywhere, it's terrible. They won't even let me clean up. Don't want me \"disturbing evidence.\" I haven't even cleaned up our lunch plates from the day of the murder!\nPhoenix:\nYou mean those plates with the steak bones left over on them in the employee area?\nPenny:\nYeah. Can you believe it?\n\n\n\n\nThe fanboy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nDo kids sneak in here a lot?\nPenny:\nWell... I don't think there's that many of them, but I do see one in particular a bunch. He's always gawking at the sets, or snapping pictures. You should see Old Windbag's eyes flash when she sees him. She has a bit of trouble catching him though...\n\n\n\n\nThe director, et al.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI heard something at the trial today. They said that the director and producer were here the day of the murder...\nPenny:\nOh, sorry... I was in the prop storage room, so I didn't see them. I guess they were here, though. The studio head seemed pretty eager to keep us quiet.\nMaya:\nSo they were trying to protect the director?\nPenny:\nMore the producer, really. The producer's our real star here. She saved these studios from the brink of disaster and kept them running. I don't think we'd still be in business if it weren't for that producer!\nPhoenix:\n(The producer, huh?)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCardkey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenny:\nWow, they gave a lawyer one of those cardkeys?\nPhoenix:\nWell, I'm sort of borrowing it.\nPenny:\nI see. You better be careful not to lose that. They're very strict about those cardkeys here.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess they're pretty good about keeping these out of outsider's hands.) Thanks, I'll be careful.\n\n\n\n\nPowers's(?) Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nCould you take a look at this?\nPenny:\nThat's Mr. Powers. Why is he dragging his leg like that? What is this, anyway?\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like she didn't know about this photo or the injury that morning.) Uh... Never mind.\n\n\n\n\nSamurai Spear\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSay, you work with the props, right? About that murder weapon...\nPenny:\nYou mean the Samurai Spear? Yeah, it's a prop, but it's still pretty heavy. I hate having to carry that thing around.\nPhoenix:\n(So you'd have to be pretty strong to use that as a weapon, it sounds like. Why is Mr. Powers the only person I can think of!?)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenny:\nUmm... Not really sure what that is.

That security lady told j00 about us, eh?\nPhoenix:\nThat's right.\nManella:\nIt was a pretty regular day. We had a run-through for an action scene in the morning. Then a meeting from lunchtime in the Studio Two trailer. Heh. I was so busy I didn't even get a chance to eat lunch!\u00a0:(\nPhoenix:\nA t-bone steak, was it?\nManella:\nYeah... sux0rz! I hate missing out on food...\nMaya:\nNick... what does \"Sucksores\" mean?\nPhoenix:\nNo idea...\nManella:\nAnyway, I was in a meeting from noon till after 4:00. With the producer, and some bigwigs from the network.\nPhoenix:\n(Mr. Hammer's time of death was estimated at 2:30 PM. If he's telling the truth, that meeting gives him an alibi...)\n\n\n\n\nThe producer (appears after \"The day of the crime\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAbout the producer who was at the meeting with you...\nManella:\nOh, you mean Dee Vasquez? She's a genius. M4d sk1llz, all the way. Scary, though. *sweats* She brought these studios back from the brink of destruction. She's the one who made it possible for me to make the Steel Samurai!\nPhoenix:\nYou had a meeting with her on the day of the murder, right?\nManella:\nYeah, we were together from noon to 4:00 PM, the whole time.\n\n\n\n\nThe bigwigs (appears after \"The day of the crime\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWho exactly are these \"bigwigs\" people keep mentioning?\nManella:\nOh, the boss over at the network, and some sponsors. Also a few production guys. They piled into a limousine and got here right around noon. Major tension! *sweats*\nPhoenix:\nWere all of them with you the entire time?\nManella:\nYeah, unfortunately. They're all gray-haired geezers... *scowl*\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... sounds like they'd all be reliable witnesses.)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPowers's(?) Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManella:\n...

Let's find what we need and get out of here quick, Nick.Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirector's chair\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nHey! Look! That's the chair the director sits in! I've always wanted to sit in one of these.\nPhoenix:\n(The director...!) Maya... Take a look around that chair for me, would you? Remember that script the director was talking about? Didn't he say he'd left it somewhere?\nMaya:\nAhah! Found it, Nick! The script!\nPhoenix:\nGood work!\nScript placed in pocket.\n\n\n\n\nDirector's chair (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nHey! Look! That's the chair the director sits in! I've always wanted to sit in one of these. Hey Nick, take a look at that. One of those black-and-white boards they clap at the start of filming! And look! A megaphone! A real live megaphone!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nReady, Nick?

Anything you could tell us would be a big help.\nVasquez:\n... You know there was a meeting here at noon?\nPhoenix:\nYes. With the director and the people from the network...\nVasquez:\nCorrect. Now, listen closely. None of the people in this trailer that afternoon went to Studio One. It was impossible for us to leave.\nMaya:\nImpossible? Why?\nVasquez:\nThe path was blocked.\nPhoenix:\nThe... path?Phoenix:\nOn the day of the murder, the path that leads here was blocked?Vasquez:\nYou saw Mr. Monkey on the way here, correct?Phoenix:\nM-\"Mr. Monkey\"?Vasquez:\nThe monkey with the broken head.Phoenix:\nOh, right, that... (What an original name...)Vasquez:\nIts head fell over in the wind on the day of the murder. They didn't start moving the head out of the way until after 3:00. It was after 4:00 by the time the path was unblocked. Capice? Everyone in this trailer was stuck here until the path was cleared. Stuck in this trailer. Stuck until after 4:00. Hammer died at 2:30. Thus, none of us could have gone to Studio One.Maya:\nW-what!?Vasquez:\nIt's true. A crane came just after 3:00 to move the head. We called some people in to clear the way. I'm sure they'd corroborate my story.Phoenix:\nB-but wait! What if the head fell over after 2:30? Then you could have gone to Studio One!Vasquez:\n2:30... the time of death. ... Very well. Come.Outside Studio OneVasquez:\n... That's \"Mr. Monkey.\" When it wasn't broken, it announced the time... in \"ooks.\" One \"ook\" per hour. Ook ook ook ook. Always with the ooking.Phoenix:\n(It IS a monkey, after all.)Vasquez:\nCheck its head. The clock inside stopped when it broke.Maya:\n...! Nick, it's stopped at 2:15.Phoenix:\n2:15...?Vasquez:\nThat's right. This path was blocked from 2:15 till after 4:00.

Still, it's kind of sad to see so many empty benches... Kind of like if you threw a party, and nobody came.\n\n\n\n\nLeft path\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThis is the path that goes to Studio Two. The mascot's head fell right on the path on the day of the murder. The path was completely blocked between 2:00 and 4:00.\n\n\n\n\nMr. Monkey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI see. There's a clock and a speaker in the monkey's head. It would usually tell the time by \"ook\"ing. The clock is stopped at 2:15 now.October 18Wright & Co. Law OfficesPhoenix:\nNow what...

I'm surprised they don't have an extra large one for Mr. Manella.\n\n\n\n\nFilm camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA collection of expensive film equipment. I can't even begin to imagine how much just one of these costs. If we broke one, we'd go bankrupt for sure.\n\n\n\n\nReflecting screen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA panel for reflecting light. They call it a \"reflecting board\" or something.\n\n\n\n\nStage backdrop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA stage backdrop. This is \"Neo Fujiyama,\" according to Maya. It looks incredibly fake, but I guess the kids don't mind.\n\n\n\n\n(Step)ladder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA perfectly normal stepladder. I've never actually used one. I don't like heights. I'm a firm belever that humankind was made to keep both feet on the ground.Outside Studio TwoExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLunch table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nLooks like two people ate here. There's nothing left on the plates.\n\n\n\n\nNumber \"2\" sign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere's a big \"2\" painted here. Probably because this is Studio Two? Probably... Though it doesn't look anything like a studio.\n\n\n\n\nStudio van\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA light van for moving staff and equipment around. They've kept it in pretty good shape. Looks like it'd run fine.\n\n\n\n\nFlower garden\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nNameless flowers bloom in solitude. They probably have a proper name... But it is not for me to know. Not now, nor ever till the end of my days. ... I need a vacation.\n\n\n\n\nStorage materials\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThese look like materials for making a movie set. They've been sitting here for quite some time. This might as well be a junkyard.\n\n\n\n\nTrailer door\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe door is unlocked. We could probably just walk right in.TrailerExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft poster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAnother old movie poster. \"'The Singing Samurai' starring Jack Hammer.\" What the hell do samurai sing about? Chopping off heads?\nMia:\nIt's a samurai musical set in ancient Japan.\nPhoenix:\nA s-samurai musical? Is that even a genre!? Well, I'm impressed. You know your stuff, Mia.\nMia:\nOh, Maya's the real fan. I just picked a little up.\n\n\n\n\nMiddle poster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\"'Samurai Summer' starring Jack Hammer.\" This poster looks like it's been hanging here for years.\nMia:\nThis is one of Maya's favorite movies.\nPhoenix:\nMaybe we should replace the poster in the office with this one?\nMia:\nThat... would be kind of sad.October 18Global StudiosEmployee AreaPhoenix:\nHey! Hey, you! W-wait a sec!Mia:\n... Phoenix... Was that the boy?Phoenix:\nYeah.

It's not locked.\nMia:\nThis is where Cody ran... Let's go in and see if we can get him to talk.\n\n\n\n\nStorage room door\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThat must be the storage room. That's where they keep all the film equipment.\n\n\n\n\nVending machine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nLet's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks, or something. Popcorn, at least!\nMia:\nLook at this! \"Spaghetti in a Soda Can\"...?\nPhoenix:\nS-spaghetti? Wouldn't just the sauce come out and the noodles all stay stuck inside?\nMia:\n\"Best when slammed.\" I guess they want you to drink it in one gulp...?\nPhoenix:\nSlamming spaghetti.

According to Maya, that wig was used in some old TV show...\nCody:\nYou don't know \"Samurai Boogey-Woogey\"!? You're even lamer than I thought!\nPhoenix:\n(Why does everybody but me know about this show!?)\n\n\n\n\nPowers's bag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. Powers's bag.\nMia:\nNow, Phoenix, it's not polite to look through other people's belongings.\nPhoenix:\nH-hey, don't look at me! (Tell that to your sister!)\n\n\n\n\nTable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere's a box of snacks on the table, and some cans of soda. They're all empty. I'm glad Maya isn't here to see this.

He's only a kid.\nCody:\nYeah! Don't yell like that I'm only a kid!\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, do you know anything about what happened here?

I really like his, um, his kind nature. What a guy!\nCody:\nTotally! He looks so tough, but inside, he's as gentle as a kitten!\nPhoenix:\nYeah...\nCody:\nSo, what else do you like about him?\nPhoenix:\n(Don't tell me I have to keep this act up...)\nLeads back to:\n\"So, tell me what your favorite thing about the Steel Samurai is!\"\n\n\n\n\nHis fighting skills\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Got to think of something...\"\n\n\n\n\nWill Powers's acting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nW-well... (I've never even seen a full episode of that dumb show.) A-actually, I'm kind of a fan of Will Powers...\nCody:\nWhoa! That's totally hard-core!\nPhoenix:\n(You're calling ME hard-core?)\nCody:\nSo, what else do you like about him?\nPhoenix:\n(Don't tell me I have to keep this act up...)\nLeads back to:\n\"So, tell me what your favorite thing about the Steel Samurai is!\"\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Got to think of something...) I like it when he, uh, he vanquishes his foes!\nCody:\nYeah! Whizzam! The Steel Samurai always wins! Always! Check this out! It's my fan album!\nPhoenix:\nWhat the...? It's all pictures of the Steel Samurai.\nCody:\nI go to every live performance!\nPhoenix:\n(Those stupid publicity stunts where they beat each other up in public...?)\nCody:\nI always take a picture when the Steel Samurai lands the final blow! Whizzam! I got 'em all! I never missed one! A perfect collection! Check it out! My new digital camera!\nMia:\nWow, that's very impressive. The newest model, isn't it?\nCody:\nYou bet, lady! I just got it for my birthday. My album has a name, wanna hear it? \"The Steel Samurai: Path To Glory.\" The Steel Samurai always wins! Always! Hey, if you want this, you can have it, lady.\nMia:\nReally? Are you sure?\nCody:\nYeah, I took these with a digital camera. I got all the data at home so I can always make another one.\nMia:\nWell, then I'm happy to accept! Thank you.\n\"Path to Glory\" received.\nPhoenix:\n(What's with people always giving stuff to Mia?

You have to look at his actions, at his life!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm being lectured on life by a grade schooler...)\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYou were here on the day of the... incident, right?\nCody:\nYeah...\nPhoenix:\nDid you see anything unusual?\nCody:\n...\nMia:\nCody.\nCody:\n!\nMia:\nCody, he needs to know because he's fighting for justice. Isn't that the Steel Samurai's motto? \"For great justice\"? You have to help us fight for great justice, too.\nCody:\nI... I saw... I saw everything!\nPhoenix:\n(Well, well... We might get some useful information out of him yet.)\n\n\n\n\nWhat you saw (appears after \"The Steel Samurai\" and \"What happened\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Cody...

No looking at that, okay!\nPhoenix:\n(Believe me, I wasn't going to...)Phoenix:\nCody... I need to ask you something very important. What did you see on the day of the incident?Cody:\n... I got here that day around 2:00... I had to come in through the woods out back so that old lady wouldn't see me. I got kinda lost, though. I was in there for maybe a half hour or so. Then I finally got to the studio. After that...Mia:\nWhat is it, Cody?Cody:\nTh-the Steel Samurai killed the bad guy! He used his Samurai Spear! Just like always! One shot, one kill! It happened so fast... I got scared. I went home after that.Phoenix:\nI... I see. It must have been hard for you.Cody:\nMan, you say those nice things but it's so obvious you aren't speaking from the heart.Phoenix:\n(Umm... right.) Mia?Mia:\nYes?Phoenix:\nI think we can say for sure this means the Steel Samurai did it.Mia:\nTrue enough.Phoenix:\nAnd the director has an alibi, so it wasn't him.Mia:\nIndeed.Phoenix:\nSo... the only person left who it could have been is Will Powers!Mia:\n... I have to admit, it's kind of a shock. But if you put this boy on the witness stand, your client will be \"guilty\" for sure.Phoenix:\nLet's not call him then...Mia:\nI think that would be wise. Best to leave this one alone.???:\nNot so fast, pal!Gumshoe:\nI heard everything! This boy here's a key witness! And he's under police protection, starting now! C'mon, son. You've got a rendezvous with me down at the precinct!Cody:\nNo! I ain't going! Waah!Mia:\n... That didn't go so well. We're back to zero leads. And now we have a serious handicap in court.Phoenix:\nW-what're we going to do, Mia!Mia:\nWell, hmm... I... really need to be going. Don't worry, Phoenix. I'm sure you'll be fine!Phoenix:\nWhoa whoa whoa! C-come to the trial tomorrow, please! I need you there!Mia:\nPhoenix, can I ask you something? Do you really believe that Mr. Powers is innocent?I believe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOf course he is!\nMia:\n... That's all I wanted to hear. Excellent. I'll see you in court, then.\nLeads to:\n\"Great! Thanks, Mia!\"I don't know\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I never expected things to go this badly for Powers's case... I'm not sure we can win this one.)\nMia:\nPhoenix? If you don't believe him, who will!?\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh, she's mad.)\nMia:\nOh well... I'll see you in court tomorrow then.\nLeads to:\n\"Great!

Umm... Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nYes?Will:\nWhy do you look so... unhappy?Phoenix:\nO-oh! Oh, nothing! Eh heh heh. Really, it's nothing. Right, Mia? (Uh oh. She looks even unhappier...)Mia:\nPhoenix. Your client is now practically a dead man walking... Perhaps that's why I feel particularly close to him.Phoenix:\nThis is no time for dead-people jokes, please.Mia:\nYou know we're going into this trial utterly defenseless. Yet, if Mr. Powers is truly innocent... We should be able to find something overlooked in the evidence to prove it.Phoenix:\nSomething \"overlooked\"...?Mia:\nWe have to find something, Phoenix, today. It's that, or lose the trial.Phoenix:\n(This isn't going to be easy.)October 19, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:\nThe court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:\nVery well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth:\nAn unexpected fact has come to the attention of the court. Yesterday, we learned that there were other people present at the studios. Today, I would like to show evidence proving they had nothing to do with the murder.Judge:\nVery well. You may call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth.Phoenix:\n(I wonder if it'll be that producer...) (Changed from [I wonder if that producer is going to come out...] in the original release)Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution calls Mr. Sal Manella to the stand.Phoenix:\n(...or that director.)Edgeworth:\nWill the witness state his name and profession?Manella:\n... How r00d can j00 get! J00 don't know ME!? I'm the director! I make the Steel Samurai, n00b! ROFL!Edgeworth:\n...Manella:\nS... Sal Manella. I'm a director. Television.Judge:\nWere you at Global Studios on the day of the murder?Manella:\nY-yes, Your Honor.Judge:\nHmm... Very well. Please testify to the court about the events of that day.Mia:\nPhoenix. Let's start by picking this testimony apart. If Powers is innocent, you know what that means. Someone in the trailer on that day did it!Phoenix:\nR-right. (She doesn't waste any time putting on the pressure!)Witness Testimony-- The Day of the Murder --Manella:\nI was at the studios from around 9:00 that morning.\nDuring the morning, I was doing... umm... an action scene run-through.\nIt took a lot more time than I thought it would.\nI hear that everyone else ate lunch in the Employee Area...\nBut I had a meeting in the Studio Two trailer, so I ended up skipping lunch.\nWe were in the meeting until around 4:00...\nDuring the meeting, well, I'm pretty sure no one left their chairs.\nThat's about it.Judge:\nHmm... The time of Mr. Hammer's death was 2:30 PM. And according to your testimony, you were in a meeting at that time. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.Cross Examination-- The Day of the Murder --Manella:\nI was at the studios from around 9:00 that morning.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nIs that when you always come in to work?\nManella:\nOh, oh no. I come in all sort of hours. It's the \"industry\" way.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, I know all about the freaks in your \"industry\"...)\nManella:\nStill, FWIW, I was pretty busy all that day.\u00a0:(\nEdgeworth:\nTell us more about that.Manella:\nDuring the morning, I was doing... umm... an action scene run-through.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nIn the Employee Area?\nManella:\nThat's right. It was a fight scene between the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate.\nPhoenix:\nWas anyone else at the run-through?\nManella:\nOh, yeah. That security lady was sitting there watching the whole thing. LOL. She was cheering on Hammer, if you can believe it.\nPhoenix:\n(She certainly has the lungs for it...) Anyone else?\nManella:\nNope, just us four.Manella:\nIt took a lot more time than I thought it would.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy did it go on so long?\nManella:\nUm, I'm pretty sure j00've already heard about this... But WP twisted his ankle during the run-through, see...\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, right, thus the limp.)\nManella:\nWhich of course led to me missing my lunch. ROFS!\nPhoenix:\n(ROFS? Rolling on the Floor... Starving?)Manella:\nI hear that everyone else ate lunch in the Employee Area...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat exactly did they have for lunch?\nManella:\nT-bone steak! The assistant cooked some up.\nPhoenix:\n(Come to think of it, there was a plate with some bones on it in the Employee Area.)\nEdgeworth:\n\"Everyone else\" meaning that the witness did not eat with them.Manella:\nBut I had a meeting in the Studio Two trailer, so I ended up skipping lunch.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, in the end, you didn't get to eat?\nManella:\nYeah. No steak, at least! Can j00 believe it?\nPhoenix:\nThat must have been tough.\nMia:\nPhoenix.\nPhoenix:\nYeah?\nMia:\nDoesn't something about that seem odd to you?\n\n\n\nNot at all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, no, not really. Seems pretty straightforward.\nMia:\nOh. Perhaps I was wrong, then.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nIt's a little vague\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nActually, there is something bothering me. Mr. Manella, just now you said \"steak, at least.\" So you ate something other than steak?\nManella:\nYeah, good call! I had some chocolate in my pocket, which I used to stave off starvation!\nPhoenix:\nI see... (Is that all? I was sure I was on to something there.)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nIt's contradictory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYeah, it does seem odd, now that you mention it. Mr. Manella!\nManella:\nH-hmm? W-what do j00 mean? *sweats*\nPhoenix:\nWhen I went to Studio Two, I saw something on the table there. (Changed from [When I went to that trailer, I saw something on the table.] in the original release) There were two plates--the same kind of plates as the ones in the Employee Area. (Changed from [There were two plates on the table--the same kind of plates as in the Employee Area.] in the original release) Who ate lunch there?\nManella:\nM-mmpf! No, er, ah, um, eh heh. Good call! *sweats* I, er, I was embarrassed so I didn't mention it... But I did eat, after all.\nPhoenix:\nA t-bone steak, you mean?\nManella:\nYeah, well, I mean the assistant went through all that trouble... I brought it to the trailer thinking I could eat it later.\nPhoenix:\n(Clearly a man who likes to eat. I'd suspected as much...) So, when exactly did you eat it?\nManella:\nWe took one break during that meeting. I, er, wolfed it down then. *drool*\nPhoenix:\n(A mental image I will carry with me to my grave... Wait a second...! If they took a break in that meeting, that contradicts his testimony! I'll press on that one a bit more...)\nLeads back to cross-examinationManella:\nWe were in the meeting until around 4:00...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat were you discussing?\nManella:\nThe Steel Samurai story, and our budget. Get this! The sponsors turn to me and say, \"Mr. Manella. Those scripts of yours are not appropriate for children.\" Can j00 believe it!?\nPhoenix:\n(Actually, I kind of can.) So, nobody left the table during the whole meeting?Manella:\nDuring the meeting, well, I'm pretty sure no one left their chairs.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou didn't take a single break?\nManella:\nEr... well... Y-yeah! Not a one! *sweats*\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... what's he sweating so much about, I wonder? If only I had an idea... I'll wait for one to come up and hit him with it later.)Press (after selecting \"It's contradictory\" upon pressing fifth statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou didn't take a single break?\nManella:\nEr... well... Y-yeah! Not a one! *sweats*\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... what's he sweating so much about, I wonder? If only I had an idea... Wait a second... Maybe I do have an idea!)\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Wait a second!\"\n\n\n\n\nLeave him be\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, on second thought, I'm drawing a blank. If I press too hard in the wrong place, I'll just end up scaring him into silence. Maybe I'll just sit back and see what happens.)\nLeads back to cross-examinationMia:\nPhoenix. If his alibi holds, Powers is finished. Press him as hard as you can and find out where he's lying!Phoenix:\nR-right!Phoenix:\nWait a second! Mr. Manella, you've just contradicted yourself! Didn't you just tell the court that you ate that t-bone steak during a break?Manella:\nOops! ROFL!Phoenix:\nWell?Manella:\nUmm...Judge:\nMr. Manella, what's this all about?Manella:\nW-well, yeah, I guess we did take a little break.Mia:\nPhoenix! Great job! If they took a break, one of them could have gone to the studio during that time!Phoenix:\nYour Honor! I call on the witness to testify to the court about this break!Judge:\nVery well. Mr. Manella, your testimony, please.Manella:\nUrk!Edgeworth:\nHeh heh heh...Phoenix:\n(Uh oh. Edgeworth is laughing...)Witness Testimony-- The Break --Manella:\nYeah, FWIW, we took a break... ROFL!\nBut it was only 15 minutes! 15! That's only 13 in Base 12!\nNot enough time for someone to, say, commit murder in Studio One! LOL!\nThat's only just enough time to eat a t-bone steak, if you ask me! *steams*Judge:\nHmm... I don't think it would even be enough time for that, but that's just me. Very well. You may begin the cross-examination.Cross Examination-- The Break --Manella:\nYeah, FWIW, we took a break... ROFL!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat time exactly did you take this break?\nManella:\nHmm... I'd say it was from around 2:30 or so until 2:45.\nPhoenix:\n(2:30!!! That's the time of death! So he could have gone to Studio One, killed Hammer, and come back... I guess it's possible, time-wise...)\nEdgeworth:\n...Manella:\nBut it was only 15 minutes! 15! That's only 13 in Base 12!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat were you doing for those 15 minutes?\nManella:\nEating my t-bone steak! What else!?\nPhoenix:\nThere were two plates on the trailer table...?\nManella:\nOh, right. The other one was Diva's... sorry, Dee Vasquez's plate.\nPhoenix:\n(Dee Vasquez... the producer.)\nEdgeworth:\nTo eat a t-bone steak in 15 minutes... that's quite a feat.Manella:\nNot enough time for someone to, say, commit murder in Studio One! LOL!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy is that?Press (after pressing first statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Why is that?\"Manella:\nThat's only just enough time to eat a t-bone steak, if you ask me! *steams*Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nI have to say, you look like a guy who gets through his meals pretty fast.\nManella:\nWell, I was facing a cold, slightly chewy t-bone steak... Even I have to take my time eating that kind of food. LOLMia:\nWell, Phoenix?Phoenix:\nThat testimony was too short to wring any kind of useful information out of!Mia:\nAll you have to do is prove that he was able to go to Studio One in that time!Phoenix:\n(Oh, great. Is that all...)Phoenix:\nWhy is that?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nHaven't we had enough of this pointless line of questioning? Your Honor! The testimony to this point has made one certain fact painfully clear: The people in the trailer had nothing to do with this murder! It was impossible for any of them to go to Studio One!Phoenix:\nWhat!?Edgeworth:\nSomething wrong, Mr. Wright? Surely you aren't suggesting one of the people in the trailer went to Studio One!Judge:\nHmm... Well, Mr. Wright?Mia:\nPhoenix, this is critical! Think about it before you give your answer!Judge:\nDo you claim someone from the trailer went to Studio One?I claim it, and claim it loud\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If I agree to let everyone in that trailer off the hook then the trial is over... Mr. Powers will be found guilty for sure!) The victim was murdered at 2:30, the exact time of the break in the meeting. With 15 minutes, murder is certainly a possibility!\nJudge:\nHmm... I suppose you might say that...\nPhoenix:\n(Alright, I've got the judge thinking now!)\nEdgeworth:\nTsk, tsk, tsk... Never a dull moment with you, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nWhat's your point, Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nYou've been doing your homework, haven't you? Look at the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nThe Court Record...?\nEdgeworth:\nSurely, you knew that from 2:15 to 4:00 the path between the studios was blocked? Mrs. Monkey's head had fallen across the path!\nPhoenix:\nWhoa! You're right!\nEdgeworth:\nTrue, the break in the trailer meeting came right at the time of death... However! The path from there to the scene of the crime was blocked! The fallen Mrs. Monkey head barred the way!\nPhoenix:\n... (It's actually \"Mr. Monkey,\" but Edgeworth has a point... And somehow, I feel no desire to correct him.)\nJudge:\nNo counter-argument, Mr. Wright? Then I'm afraid you lose this round.\nLeads to:\n\"I believe we have seen enough evidence.\"No, it's impossible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I don't want to write off so many possible suspects... But I can't keep claiming the impossible, either...) I agree that it was impossible for anyone in the trailer to go to the studio in that time.\nEdgeworth:\nHa hah! I thought you might be thoughtlessly treading on thin ice again! But I see you had at least an inkling of the truth.\nJudge:\nWhat do you mean, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's quite simple... True, the break in the trailer meeting came right at the time of death... However! The path from there to the scene of the crime was blocked! The fallen Mrs. Monkey head barred the way! At around 2:15, a strong gust of wind knocked off the studio mascot's head. Ergo! When the people in the trailer took a break at 2:30, the way to the studio was blocked. Blocked... by Mrs. Monkey's severed head!\nPhoenix:\n... (It's actually \"Mr. Monkey,\" but Edgeworth has a point... And somehow, I feel no desire to correct him.)\nLeads to:\n\"I believe we have seen enough evidence.\"Edgeworth:\nI believe we have seen enough evidence. I would like to relieve Mr. Manella from the stand.Phoenix:\n(Wh-what? It's over?)Judge:\nVery well. The court's opinion on this case is as follows: We have found that there were several other people in Studio 2 on the day of the murder. However, it is also clear that none of these people could have gone to Studio One. They therefore have no relation to this case. Furthermore, with regards to the photo of the Steel Samurai... Given the size of the costume, no one other than Mr. Powers could have worn it that day. All that is lacking is decisive evidence that he is the one who did it. If we had that, I'm afraid I would have to find Mr. Powers guilty.Edgeworth:\nYour Honor. The prosecution is pleased to announce that we indeed have decisive evidence: a witness.Judge:\nWho is this witness, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nMy witness saw the very moment when the Steel Samurai skewered the victim!Judge:\nOrder! I will have order! I see. The court will take a 10 minute recess, after which we will hear your witness. Court is adjourned for recess!October 19, 11:04 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Mia:\n...Phoenix:\nWhat do we do now, Mia? If everyone in that trailer has an alibi...Mia:\n... I'm sorry, Phoenix. I guess I was wrong.Phoenix:\nM-Mia! Don't tell me you're giving up! If you give up, what hope do I have...?Mia:\n... Don't get me wrong. I've never given up on a trial before, not while there was a chance. Only one thing became clear in your cross-examination. The people in the trailer could not have gone to Studio One. I thought there was more to it than that... But I was wrong. That's all there is.Will:\nUmm... Er... What's going to happen to me? It kinda seems like everyone in that courtroom thinks I did it... They think I'm a murderer!Mia:\nDon't worry, Mr. Powers. If you are innocent, we will prove it. I guarantee it. Leave it to us, and... be yourself. Be strong. You are the Steel Samurai, hero to children everywhere, after all.Will:\nI... You... Thanks. *sniff*Mia:\nOkay, Phoenix. This one's for the kids! Let's do it!October 19, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:\nCourt is back in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution has a concern. As our witness is a grade schooler of tender years, and this is a murder case... we worry that the defense might cause unnecessary trauma with his cruel questioning. (Changed from [We worry that the defense might cause unnecessary trauma with his cruel questioning!] in the original release)Phoenix:\n(Nice to see Edgeworth taking the moral high ground...)Edgeworth:\nHowever, we have no choice. The prosecution calls Cody Hackins to the stand.Edgeworth:\nYour Honor. Perhaps you could arrange a box for him to stand on?Judge:\nOh, r-right. Guard, please bring him a box. One of those donut crates should do.Edgeworth:\nWill the witness state his name and grade in school.Cody:\n...Edgeworth:\nWitness!Cody:\nWhat!? Just 'cause you're all grown-up don't mean you can push me around!Edgeworth:\nMrph...Mia:\nCody? Answer his question, okay?Cody:\nH-hey, it's you! The nice lady! I'm Cody Hackins. I'm in 2nd grade!Phoenix:\n(I get the feeling this is going to be a long, long day...)Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth. Please remember that you're speaking to a child. Try to be gentle.Edgeworth:\nM-mrrrrph! Witness! Er, I mean, Cody.Phoenix:\n(He's having trouble with this \"gentle\" thing.)Edgeworth:\nYou were present, er, you were at Global Studios on the day of the, er, incident?Cody:\nYou got a problem with that!?Edgeworth:\nPlease tell us what you saw that day.Cody:\nWhat, pops? You want me to tell you and gramps with the beard over there?Edgeworth:\nJust.. Mr. Edgeworth will be fine.Judge:\nI prefer \"bearded gentleman\" myself.Phoenix:\n(A very long day...)Judge:\nIncidentally, photographic equipment is strictly forbidden in this courtroom.Edgeworth:\nM-mpht! M-my apologies, Your Honor. He said he wouldn't testify if he couldn't bring it... I'd like special permission, if that's possible.Phoenix:\nWait, so you're saying you had to bargain terms with a kid... and you LOST?Cody:\nHey! I just got this new camera! Don't really know how to use it all that good yet! But I bring it with me wherever I go!Mia:\nPhoenix. I wonder if he had that camera on the day of the murder... You'd better make a note of it in the Court Record.Cody's Camera added to the Court Record.Judge:\nVery well, Cody. Please testify to the court about what you saw the day of the incident.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Cody:\nI wanted to see a Steel Samurai rehearsal, just once.\nI found a map on the Internet, and went to the studios that day.\nI went through the woods off the path, so that old lady wouldn't catch me.\nI was going for the studio.\nI got kinda lost on the way, though. For about 30 minutes.\nWhen I came out by the studio, there was the Steel Samurai!\nIt totally rocked! Right before my eyes, out came the bad guy!\nOf course, the Steel Samurai took him down! Pow!\nIf I had my camera with me, that woulda been the time for a shot, I tell you.\nAnyway, I couldn't get into the studio, so I went home.Judge:\nHmm... Very well. The defense may begin its cross-examination. But be gentle. Remember you're talking to a child. (Changed from [And, be gentle. Remember you're talking to a child.] in the original release)Cody:\n...Phoenix:\n(This kid is tougher than most adults we see in here, honestly...)Cross Examination-- Witness's Account --Cody:\nI wanted to see a Steel Samurai rehearsal, just once.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou really like the Steel Samurai, huh?\nCody:\nCourse I do! I've taped every show! And I go to all the live performances!\nPhoenix:\nThat's impressive. Have you been to the amusement park?\nCody:\nCourse! Duh! My Dad always takes me!\nPhoenix:\n(Poor, poor Dad...)Cody:\nI found a map on the Internet, and went to the studios that day.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWas that day the first time you'd been to the studio?\nCody:\nUh, actually I've been a couple of times. I never manage to get there on a rehearsal day! And that security lady's always yelling...\nEdgeworth:\nRight, right. Please continue.\nCody:\nChill, pops! I'm getting to it! How am I supposed to talk with you cuttin' me off all the time? Geez!\nEdgeworth:\n...Cody:\nI went through the woods, off the path, so that old lady wouldn't catch me.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Off the path\"...?\nCody:\nYeah, you know how the studios are in a valley there? If you go off the path a little, there's woods. That's where I was!\nPhoenix:\nI see.\nCody:\nAnyhow...Cody:\nI was going for the studio.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid nothing unusual happen on your way to the studio?\nCody:\n\"Unusual\"?\nPhoenix:\nDid you see this monkey by any chance?\nCody:\nOh, you mean Mr. Monkey? Yeah I saw him, but his head wasn't busted!\nEdgeworth:\nSo you went straight to the studio?Cody:\nI got kinda lost on the way, though. For about 30 minutes.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou got lost in the woods?\nCody:\nYeah. I couldn't figure out which way I was walking. Man, was I relieved when I saw the blue studio doors. But guess what happened next!Cody:\nWhen I came out by the studio, there was the Steel Samurai!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe Steel Samurai?\nCody:\nYeah, he was standing by the studio gate. It looked like he was thinking about something before going in. Then he opened up the gate and went inside.\nPhoenix:\nI see. What then?Cody:\nIt totally rocked! Right before my eyes, out came the bad guy!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat sort of \"bad guy\" was it?\nCody:\nA guy. A person. Kinda tall. Skinny.\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure it was a guy?\nCody:\n... I dunno. He was kinda far away.\nPhoenix:\n(Huh, he's being awfully vague...)\nMia:\n...Cody:\nOf course, the Steel Samurai took him down! Pow!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat happened to the bad guy?\nCody:\nHuh? Well... Well, he kinda didn't move. Not a bit. Like he was dead. I-I guess he's a real pro! What a great actor!\nPhoenix:\nY-yes, I suppose he was.Cody:\nIf I had my camera with me, that woulda been the time for a shot, I tell you.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"If\" you had your camera? You mean, you weren't carrying your camera then?\nCody:\nN-no, I wasn't. I-it's not like I have it all the time!\nPhoenix:\n(Really...?)Present Cody's Camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Cody, what you just said seems, well, a little strange.\"Phoenix:\n(I guess seeing the killing freaked him out and he went home...)Mia:\nPhoenix. Remember, he's a child. Use gentle words... but be firm.Phoenix:\n(Easy for you to say...)Phoenix:\nCody, what you just said seems, well, a little strange. Didn't you say before that you always bring your digital camera wherever you go? You were quite clear about that.Cody:\nHuh!?Phoenix:\nCody, you shouldn't lie here. You understand that, right?Judge:\nMr. Wright! A word with you...Phoenix:\n(Uh oh... was I putting the pressure on too much?)Judge:\nWhat is this \"digital\" camera contraption you're talking about?Phoenix:\nIt's umm... a digital camera, Your Honor. It's kind of a new sort of camera. (How do I explain that!?)Judge:\nI see.Phoenix:\nAnyway, Cody... I can't believe you wouldn't bring your camera on a trip to the studios! You did bring it, didn't you?Cody:\nUmm...Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nMr. Wright! How cruel you are, to terrorize a poor child so!Phoenix:\nI don't care if he's a child or a prosecuting attorney! No one should lie in court!Edgeworth:\nWhat do you mean \"or a prosecuting attorney\"!?Phoenix:\nWell, Cody?Cody:\nWh-what! Yeah, so I had my camera. So what!? You got a problem with that!?Judge:\nSo, you did have a camera? And did you use this camera?Cody:\nW-why would I use it? I... I was too busy watching.Judge:\nHmm... Very well. Please testify to the court about what you were so busy watching.Witness Testimony-- What I Saw --Cody:\nY-yeah, I had my camera with me.\nBut I was glued to the action! I couldn't take my eyes off it!\nThe Steel Samurai, he goes for the bad guy... wham!\nThen... then the bad guy stopped moving!\nHe's so strong! The Steel Samurai rules!Judge:\nHmm... Ah? Is that all? Well, that was brief. Mr. Wright, your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- What I Saw --Cody:\nY-yeah, I had my camera with me.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, why didn't you use it?\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nHe's getting to that! Relax and listen.\nCody:\nUmm... I didn't use it 'cause I was too busy watching the real thing!Cody:\nBut I was glued to the action! I couldn't take my eyes off it!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you were watching the Steel Samurai. Did you watch the whole fight?\nCody:\nY-yeah, of course!\nPhoenix:\nYou didn't turn away, not even once?\nCody:\nN... no!\nPhoenix:\nOkay, then tell us exactly what happened.\nCody:\nY-yeah! I'm getting to that!Cody:\nThe Steel Samurai, he goes for the bad guy... wham!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo the bad guy attacked him first?\nCody:\nYeah!\nPhoenix:\nWhat sort of person was this \"bad guy\"?\nCody:\nI told you, a person. He was a person.\nPhoenix:\nHow was he dressed?\nCody:\n... I kinda don't remember. I was too busy watching the Steel Samurai!\nEdgeworth:\nI see. And what happened next?Cody:\nThen... then the bad guy stopped moving!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy?\nCody:\nHuh? Whaddya mean, \"why\"?\nPhoenix:\nWhy wasn't the bad guy moving?\nCody:\nW-well 'cause the Steel Samurai brought him to justice!\nPhoenix:\nAnd how exactly did he do that?\nCody:\nH-how did he do it? With a Samurai Kick! And a Samurai Punch! Samurai Chop! ... Samurai Slap! S-something like that.\nPhoenix:\n(He's still being vague about this...)\nCody:\nWhat! Don't gimme that look, pops!\nPhoenix:\n(How should I play this?)\n\n\n\nWait and see what happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah... If I press too hard now, the judge might keep me from continuing. I'll sit back and see how the rest of this goes.)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress him harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Cody.\"Cody:\nHe's so strong! The Steel Samurai rules!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat did you do after the bad guy fell, Cody?\nCody:\n... Um, actually... The fight was so... so intense that I got kinda scared. So I went straight home.\nPhoenix:\n(Something isn't adding up here...)Phoenix:\n(Something about his account doesn't seem right...)Mia:\nPhoenix. It doesn't seem right because he's being deliberately vague! Press him on the facts, Phoenix! Find out what he saw!Phoenix:\nCody.Cody:\nWh-what!?Phoenix:\nSomething's bothering me. Before you said that you \"couldn't take your eyes off\" the action.Cody:\nY-yeah? So what?Phoenix:\nYet you missed the most important part!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nWhat is the meaning of this? The witness has stated what he saw quite clearly...Phoenix:Phoenix:\nYou know as well as I do that he's being vague! Tell me, what kind of murderer uses a \"Samurai Slap\"!?Edgeworth:\nM-mmph!Phoenix:\nMy point is this: Cody, you may have seen some of the Steel Samurai's fight... But you missed the most important part: the killing blow!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Mr. Wright! How could this be? Can you explain how he might have missed something so vital?Phoenix:\nUm, well... er, that's the thing...Mia:\nPhoenix! I believe you're on the right track with this! Think: why didn't Cody see the climax of the fight? I know you! You can figure this out!Judge:\nMr. Wright, your answer! We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai... Why wouldn't he watch the climax of the fight?He couldn't watch it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nBecause he couldn't watch it! How could he calmly watch a murder taking place at his age!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nJust a moment, please... One thing has become quite clear in this boy's testimony. He did not believe he was witnessing a murder! He was watching the Steel Samurai fight, like on TV. The more real the fight, the more he would have watched!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... huh.\nJudge:\nI have to agree with Mr. Edgeworth. Well, Mr. Wright. Do you have another explanation?\nLeads back to:\n\"We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai...\"He was watching something else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHe missed the climax of the fight... because he was looking at something else! Probably!\nEdgeworth:\n\"Probably\"?\nJudge:\n\"Something else\"?\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Wright, explain yourself! What could possibly distract this boy from seeing his idol, the Steel Samurai, fight!? What do you claim he was looking at?\nPhoenix:\nO-ooof! (C'mon, think of something... think of something... Nothing.)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Please refrain from making baseless claims!\nPhoenix:\nY-yes... Sorry, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nDo you have another explanation for this?\nLeads back to:\n\"We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai...\"Show evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor, I have evidence.\nJudge:\n\"Evidence\"...?\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. Why did Cody look away from the fight?\n\n\n\nPresent Cody's Camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Here's my proof!\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHere's my proof!\nJudge:\nProof?\nPhoenix:\nUm, uh... Can I... do that again? (This doesn't prove anything...!)\nEdgeworth:\nHah! Lost your nerve, have you?\nJudge:\nVery well... I'll ask you the question again.\nLeads back to:\n\"We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai...\"Phoenix:\nHere's my proof!Judge:\nWhat's that? The camera...?Phoenix:\nThe witness stated that he recently received this camera.Judge:\nYes, I'm aware of that.Phoenix:\nHe wasn't entirely familiar with its operation.Judge:\nI'm aware of that, too. Ah!Phoenix:\nCorrect! Why would Cody be looking somewhere else at the critical moment? Because he was looking at his camera! He was trying to take a picture!Cody:\nHey!Phoenix:\nBullseye!Cody:\nW-what's your problem, pops! You got a thing for picking on little kids!?Phoenix:\n(Pressing, not picking...)Mia:\nGood job, Phoenix! Cody was lying, clearly. Smart of you to realize there was no way he could just stand there, watching his hero... and not take a picture!Phoenix:\nRight! Cody? There was only one reason why you would have looked away from the fight. And that was because you wanted to take a picture. But having just received your camera, you weren't used to using it yet! So, you missed the climax of the fight. Correct?Cody:\n... ... ... Yeah.Mia:\nWell, Phoenix. I'll bet you anything he's hiding more than that. Have him testify again!Phoenix:\nR-right. (Mia means business!) Your Honor. The defense would like to request that Cody Hackins testify once more.Judge:\nV-very well. Cody? Could you please tell us about your camera... And about why you didn't take a picture of the fight?Cody:\nUmm...Phoenix:\n(Welcome to the real world, kid!)Witness Testimony-- No Photo? --Cody:\nYeah, you're right, pops.\nThe Steel Samurai had just escaped from the clutches of the villain.\nSo I held up my camera to take a picture!\nBut the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it.\nTh-that's all that happened. Yup.Judge:\nHmm... Anything strange in that testimony, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nI'm not sure... But I'd like to proceed with the cross-examination anyway.Cross Examination-- No Photo? --Cody:\nYeah, you're right, pops.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Pops\"...?\nCody:\nYeah, I called you \"pops,\" you spiky-haired geezer!\nPhoenix:\nG-geezer...?\nEdgeworth:\nI'm \"Mr. Edgeworth.\"\nJudge:\nAnd I guess I'm the \"bearded gentleman\"...\nCody:\nThat's what I hate about grown-ups. You're all so self-conscious!\nPhoenix:\nOkay, off with the kid gloves! Testify, witness, testify!\nCody:\nYipes!Cody:\nThe Steel Samurai had just escaped from the clutches of the villain.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you did see the beginning of the fight?\nCody:\nYeah.\nPhoenix:\nDid you notice anything unusual?\nCody:\nUmm... well... uh... I guess the Steel Samurai was moving a little strange...\nPhoenix:\n(Moving... strangely?)Cody:\nSo I held up my camera to take a picture!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy couldn't you take a picture?\nCody:\nMy new camera has too many buttons. I couldn't figure it out. I tried to take a picture, I really tried.Cody:\nBut the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhen the lens opened, what did you see?\nCody:\nUh... well, a person on the ground. And the Steel Samurai!Cody:\nTh-that's all that happened. Yup.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThat's all?\nCody:\nY-yeah! I told you, I didn't take a picture!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... I would have, once I got that lens open... Did he really not take a picture? Not even one?)\n\n\n\nPress him hard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Nah, he definitely would have taken a picture. There's got to be something here I can use!) Cody! Listen up, Cody Hackins. I know exactly what happened that day. You took a picture!\nCody:\n... Hey!\nPhoenix:\n(Bullseye...?)\nCody:\nH-how did you know!?\nPhoenix:\nI see through all your lies Cody Hackins. It's one of my powers!\nCody:\nW-wow!\nPhoenix:\n(This feels great!)\nCody:\nY-yeah... Yeah, I took a picture.\nJudge:\nPerhaps you can change your testimony to reflect this, Cody?\nChanges statement from \"Th-that's all that happened. Yup.\" to \"I took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em.\"\n\n\n\n\nLet it slide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(He looks ready to burst into tears... I'd better lay off him for now.)\nLeads back to cross-examinationCody:\nI took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou \"erased\" them?\nCody:\nY-yeah!\nPhoenix:\nWhy would you erase a picture of your beloved Steel Samurai, victorious?\nCody:\nWell... y'know. W-why would I want to keep a picture like that?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... he's becoming less and less cooperative. I better find a clear contradiction soon... or some solid evidence.)Present \"Path to Glory\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Cody!\"Phoenix:\n(How can I pick holes in such a short testimony?)Mia:\nThere has to be something. Dig up the dirt, Phoenix! Find out what this kid's all about!Phoenix:\nCody!Cody:\nWh-wh-what!? Man, every time you say \"Cody\" you follow it with something bad.Phoenix:\nI just wanted to thank you for giving me this the other day.Cody:\nHuh? O-oh... right.Phoenix:\nWhat was it you told me then?Cody:\nI go to every live performance! I always take a picture when the Steel Samurai lands the final blow! Whizzam! I got 'em all! I never missed one! A perfect collection!Phoenix:\nCody. Did you really get a picture of the Steel Samurai standing victorious over his foe? If you did, I find it hard to believe that you would just erase it! Wouldn't you keep it for your album?Cody:\nAh!Judge:\nMr. Wright... What exactly is this album?Phoenix:\nIt's called \"Path to Glory.\" It's a collection of pictures of the Steel Samurai, all taken by Cody Hackins. He claims it's a perfect collection of every battle the Steel Samurai has won!Judge:\nI... I see.Phoenix:\nDon't you find this very odd, Your Honor? Among all his pictures of the Steel Samurai, none were taken that day!Judge:\nOrder! Mr. Wright. Have you an explanation? If the Steel Samurai had just defeated his adversary... I certainly would expect to see a picture of it in this album...Phoenix:\nExactly my point, Your Honor! ... ... .........! (No... wait... no way!)Mia:\nPhoenix? I think we've finally discovered the truth. And what a truth it is!Phoenix:\nM-Mia... are we sure about this? Did he actually...?Mia:\nYes. I'm pretty sure what you're thinking is right. Tell them, Phoenix. Tell them what the truth is.Judge:\nMr. Wright! Please explain to the court what is going on here! Why was there no picture in the album from the day of the murder? Why would the boy have erased the photos he took?The photos were blurry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI believe that Cody Hackins is what we call an \"artiste.\"\nJudge:\nAn... \"artiste\"...?\nPhoenix:\nHe didn't like the photos he had taken! They were blurry, or maybe his framing was off... Anyway, for some reason, he erased the data!\nJudge:\nIs that right, Cody?\nCody:\nWh-what do you mean \"framing was off\"!?\nJudge:\nIt seems the only thing \"off\" is your guesswork, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nUm, uh... Yes, well, I'm sure the real reason is...\nJudge:\nYes? The real reason is?\nLeads back to:\n\"Why was there no picture in the album from the day of the murder?\"He erased them by mistake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSimple, Your Honor. Cody wasn't used to using his new camera. He erased those photos he took by mistake!\nMia:\nW-wait a second, Phoenix. If that's your answer, we're back where we started!\nPhoenix:\nHuh? You mean, that wasn't it?\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! If you have something to say to the court, speak up!\nPhoenix:\nUm, well... S-sorry, Your Honor. Can I change my answer?\nJudge:\nHmm... *sigh*\nLeads back to:\n\"Why was there no picture in the album from the day of the murder?\"The Steel Samurai didn't win\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"I can think of only one reason, Your Honor.\"Phoenix:\nI can think of only one reason, Your Honor. The Steel Samurai didn't win! That's why Cody deleted those photos.Judge:\nYou mean the Steel Samurai... lost?Phoenix:\nWell, Cody? I'm right, aren't I? Tell the truth. The bad guy defeated the Steel Samurai!Cody:\nN-n-n-no way! No! I-it's impossible! Th-the Steel Samurai never loses! He never loses to anyone! Ever!Phoenix:\nYour Honor... The witness has revealed everything with his words. There was a reason why he lied and told us he didn't take a picture. The same reason he erased his precious photos! For Cody, it was inconceivable that the Steel Samurai could be defeated. However, Cody witnessed the impossible! He saw the Steel Samurai lose! Yet to admit what he saw would destroy everything he believed in! That's why he lied and said the Steel Samurai won. He couldn't handle the truth!Judge:\nO-Order! I will have order! W-witness! I mean, Cody! Is this true!? W-what did you see? Tell the court what you saw!Cody:\nI...... Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!Phoenix:\nCody... That day, you saw the Steel Samurai lose a fight. Right?Cody:\nWaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Okay okay! Y-you're right! Th-the Steel Samurai f-fell down... Th-then he didn't m-move... Waaaaaaaaah!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order!Edgeworth:\nWhat kind of stunt are you trying to pull, Wright!? The Steel Samurai was the murderer, not the victim!Phoenix:\nYet according to your witness's testimony, the Steel Samurai was the one who fell!Judge:\nMr. Wright! What's going on?Phoenix:\nApparently, we have all made a serious error.Edgeworth:\nAn... error? What's this all about!?Hammer was the victim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nQuite simply, the victim was Jack Hammer!\nJudge:\n...\nEdgeworth:\n...\n...\nJudge:\nUmm... Mr. Wright? We all know that.\nPhoenix:\nRight.\nJudge:\nPerhaps you'd like to reconsider your last statement?\nPhoenix:\n... I'm sorry. It was I who was wrong.\nEdgeworth:\nOkay, Wright! First you're right, now you're wrong!? Which is it!?\nPhoenix:\nL-look, I'm sure there's something we're overlooking!\nEdgeworth:\nIf you're so sure, then tell us what it is!\nLeads back to:\n\"What's this all about!?\"Steel Samurai was the victim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"If you understand what really happened, it's actually quite simple.\"There was no victim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere was no victim in this case!\nJudge:\nWh-wh-what!? Has the defense taken leave of its senses!?\nPhoenix:\nOf course, Jack Hammer died. But the Steel Samurai fell too! It was a draw!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\n... Sorry. I was too shocked to say anything for a bit there. Listen, Wright! Only one person died in this incident, and that is Jack Hammer! Yet now you claim there \"was no victim\"? Are you insane?\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh, he's pulling out all the stops now.) ... I'm sorry. It was I who was wrong.\nEdgeworth:\nOkay, Wright! First you're right, now you're wrong!? Which is it!?\nPhoenix:\nL-look, I'm sure there's something we're overlooking!\nEdgeworth:\nIf you're so sure, then tell us what it is!\nLeads back to:\n\"What's this all about!?\"Phoenix:\nIf you understand what really happened, it's actually quite simple. At the end of the fight, the Steel Samurai fell to the ground, and lay still. In other words, the Steel Samurai was not the killer, he was the victim! Don't you see? Jack Hammer was the Steel Samurai!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! So, the Steel Samurai in this photograph... You're saying the man in this costume was the victim, Mr. Jack Hammer?Phoenix:\nThat's what I'm saying, Your Honor. Jack Hammer was present at the action scene run-through that morning. Thus, he obviously knew about Will Powers's foot injury.Judge:\nB-but wait! Hadn't Mr. Hammer gone to Studio One already?Phoenix:\nThat's what everyone thought! But remember what Ms. Oldbag said in her testimony?Oldbag:\nOn the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM. Did I see poor old Hammer? Nope. He'd already gone to the studio before I got back to the guard station.Phoenix:\nMr. Jack Hammer left the Employee Area after lunch. However, no one saw him going to Studio One. Nor was there a picture of him. He waited for Mr. Powers to take a nap in his dressing room. Then he snuck into the dressing room and stole the Steel Samurai costume.Judge:\n...Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nBut why would the victim do such a thing?Phoenix:\nI... don't know.Cody:\n... I get it!Phoenix:\n?Cody:\nI thought that the Steel Samurai was moving strange. So it was a different person inside the suit! Pops!Phoenix:\nHuh, me? What?Cody:\nActually, there was one piece of data I saved.Phoenix:\nData?Cody:\nYeah, a photo on my digital camera!Phoenix:\n! W-what!?Edgeworth:\nShow us, quick!Cody:\nNo way man, not if you're gonna look at me like that!Judge:\nNow!Cody:\n*sniff* Here... This is it.Judge:\n... Well, looking at this it's still a little hard to say. I'm afraid that it could be anyone in that costume. Your opinion, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nI agree, Your Honor. This isn't decisive evidence.Judge:\nI'm sorry, this doesn't look like it's the proof we need. I'll give it back.Mia:\nWait, Phoenix!Phoenix:\nMia? What?Mia:\nLook at that photo once more! That's it Phoenix! That photo is all the evidence you need to win this trial!Phoenix:\nWh-what!? Y-Your Honor! May I see that photo once more please?Judge:\nC-certainly. I don't see why not.Mia:\nPhoenix! Show him! There's a glaring, decisive inconsistency with the facts as we know them in that photo!Phoenix:\n(Find the inconsistency in the photo!)Present number \"2\" sign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor! Look at this!\"Present Steel Samurai\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's right here!\nJudge:\nThe Steel Samurai...?\nPhoenix:\nYes, that's about the only thing in this picture that could be inconsistent. The Steel Samurai is inconsistent with... something.\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWright! This is no time for daydreaming and pointless pontification! Think about your client, and us, who are forced to listen to your rambling!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, please rethink your position.\nLeads back to:\n\"Find the inconsistency in the photo!\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nI think it's here.\nJudge:\nYou seem to be lacking even more confidence than usual.\nPhoenix:\nI suppose that's because I'm not confident about it at all.\nJudge:\nMaybe you want to rethink your case, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nYes, please, Your Honor.\nLeads back to:\n\"Find the inconsistency in the photo!\"Phoenix:\nYour Honor! Look at this!Judge:\nI see... a gate?Phoenix:\nMight I draw your attention to the number on that gate?Judge:\nThe number? Ah yes. Well, it's hard to see, but it looks like a \"2.\"Phoenix:\nClearly not a \"1,\" Your Honor, correct?Edgeworth:\nAaaaaah!Phoenix:\nI believe Mr. Edgeworth sees what I'm getting at.Edgeworth:\nB-but... Th-that's impossible!Judge:\nHmm? Eh? What's this all about? Please explain so that I might be shocked along with the rest of the court.Phoenix:\nI'll use the studio guidemap. The body was found here, in Studio One. However, what do we see in this photo taken at the time of the murder? It does NOT say \"1\" on that gate in the photo. Your Honor! Here is the true scene of the crime! (Show the judge where the murder took place!)Present Studio Two\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Here, at Studio Two.\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nIt was here!\nJudge:\nWhat does that have to do with the number on the gate in the photograph...?\nPhoenix:\nUmm... well... Sorry, Your Honor, I guess I hadn't thought it that far through yet.\nJudge:\nThink it through before you point at the map this time, Mr. Wright! Once again! Where is he scene of this crime?\nLeads back to:\n\"Show the judge where the murder took place!\"Phoenix:\nHere, at Studio Two.Judge:\nI see! That would explain the \"2\" on the gate in the photo.Phoenix:\nYour Honor, I find it very significant that the murder took place in Studio Two!The trailer is there\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAs you may recall, there is a trailer in Studio Two. Now, on that day, a meeting was held in that very trailer. There was a break in the meeting corresponding to the time of death. During that break, Mr. Sal Manella and Ms. Dee Vasquez were outside, eating steak. They were at the scene of the crime! The path to the trailer was blocked!\nJudge:\nSo we have heard.\nPhoenix:\nThe path was blocked at 2:15... In other words, the victim went to Studio Two before that time!\nJudge:\nYes... yes, I suppose that would be the case.\nPhoenix:\nRemember Mr. Sal Manella's testimony? Allow me to remind the court: He said no one in the trailer was guilty because they could not have gone to Studio One. Yet, in actuality, the reverse was true! Only someone in the trailer could have committed this murder! They were the only ones with access to the scene of the crime: Studio Two!\nLeads to:\n\"O-order! Order!\"The path was blocked\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe path to the trailer was blocked!\nJudge:\nSo we have heard.\nPhoenix:\nThe path was blocked at 2:15... In other words, the victim went to Studio Two before that time!\nJudge:\nYes... yes, I suppose that would be the case.\nPhoenix:\nRemember Mr. Sal Manella's testimony? Allow me to remind the court: He said no one in the trailer was guilty because they could not have gone to Studio One. Yet, in actuality, the reverse was true! Only someone in the trailer could have committed this murder! They were the only ones with access to the scene of the crime: Studio Two! As you may recall, there is a trailer in Studio Two. Now, on that day, a meeting was held in that very trailer. There was a break in the meeting corresponding to the time of death. During that break, Mr. Sal Manella and Ms. Dee Vasquez were outside, eating steak. They were at the scene of the crime!\nLeads to:\n\"O-order! Order!\"No filming is done there\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nStudio Two is no longer being used for filming!\nJudge:\nI see... And this is significant... why?\nPhoenix:\n(Good question! I really should think these things through more.)\nJudge:\nWould you like to take another stab at it? So to speak?\nPhoenix:\nS-stabbing away, Your Honor.\nLeads back to:\n\"Your Honor, I find it very significant that the murder took place in Studio Two!\"Judge:\nO-order! Order!Phoenix:\nThe defense makes the following claims: The scene of the crime was Studio Two! The person that the security guard, Ms. Oldbag saw was the victim, Mr. Jack Hammer! Mr. Hammer, for some reason, stole a Steel Samurai costume. Then he went to Studio Two!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nThis is madness! Jack Hammer is the victim! The victim! Why would he steal a Steel Samurai costume!? Are you suggesting he did so to cover up the details of his own murder!?Phoenix:\nW-well, no, of course not...Judge:\nHmm...Edgeworth:\nOr do you have proof!? Give me proof that the victim, Jack Hammer, stole the costume!I have proof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI have proof!\nEdgeworth:\nY-you do!?\nJudge:\nYou do, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\n(Now that they're so surprised suddenly I'm much less confident... I think I'm right, though!)\nLeads to:\n\"Here's my proof that Jack Hammer stole the costume!\"I don't have proof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Proof? Uh oh... I'm pretty sure I don't have anything like that...)\nMia:\nPhoenix. Even if you're not 100% sure about this, you have to try. And I think you've got proof that's good enough to win them over! Just go for it! All or nothing!\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor...\nJudge:\nYes, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nActually... I do have proof.\nLeads to:\n\"Here's my proof that Jack Hammer stole the costume!\"Phoenix:\nHere's my proof that Jack Hammer stole the costume!Present Empty Bottle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"This is it.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n(Wait, no, that can't be right... I've got to have some proof that will knock their socks off...)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! We don't have all the time in the world, here.\nPhoenix:\nY-yes, Your Honor!\nLeads back to:\n\"Here's my proof that Jack Hammer stole the costume!\"Phoenix:\nThis is it.Judge:\nAn empty... medicine bottle?Phoenix:\nI found this on the table in the Employee Area. The same table where Mr. Hammer and Mr. Powers ate. The label reads \"sleeping pills.\"Judge:\n\"Sleeping pills\"...?Phoenix:\nThe defendant, Mr. Powers, spent that entire afternoon sleeping. He was drugged... by Mr. Hammer!Judge:\nWait a moment... That bottle does raise some suspicions, yes. But there is no proof that Mr. Hammer used it.Phoenix:\nYour Honor, I have an idea.Test Powers's blood\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge:\nAn... idea? Continue.\nPhoenix:\nRun a test of Powers's blood. You should find traces of the sleeping pills.\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThis much time after the day of the murder!? Even if there were traces it still proves nothing! No blood test could tell that Hammer was the one who drugged him, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(He's right. Darn. That didn't work. Time to try another idea.)\nLeads back to:\n\"Your Honor, I have an idea.\"Fingerprint the bottle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"An... idea? Very well, let's hear it.\"Examine Hammer's body\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge:\nAn idea, Mr. Wright? And that would be?\nPhoenix:\nEr... we should examine Mr. Hammer's body.\nJudge:\nMr. Hammer...? I thought that it was Mr. Powers who was made to take the sleeping pills?\nPhoenix:\nI-indeed it was, Your Honor. (Wrong again...)\nLeads back to:\n\"Your Honor, I have an idea.\"Judge:\nAn... idea? Very well, let's hear it.Phoenix:\nI want to check this bottle for fingerprints! If my claim is true, Mr. Hammer's fingerprints should show up on this bottle!Edgeworth:\nHmm...Judge:\nI suppose you're right. Very well. The court will take possession of the bottle.Empty Bottle given to the judge.Judge:\nThis court will suspend proceedings on the current trial for today. Cody Hackin's [sic] testimony has revealed new possibilities in this case. In fact, things may have happened very differently than we previously thought. The Steel Samurai seen by Ms. Oldbag may have been the victim, Jack Hammer. The scene of the crime was not Studio One, but Studio Two. And those in the trailer did have time to commit murder. Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nYour homework is to find the answer to the following question: Why would Mr. Hammer steal the Steel Samurai costume? Also, who killed him, and why? Find the answers for me by tomorrow.Phoenix:\n(That's a lot of homework!)Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\nMm?Judge:\nYou will need to reconsider your stance in this case. Above all, you will need to reconsider your suspicion of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:\nAs you say, Your Honor.Judge:\nThis trial will be extended until tomorrow. This is the last extension!

I thought seriously about going home about three times during the trial.Phoenix:\nM-me too!Will:\nReally? You both seemed so... so confident!Phoenix:\nHah! Maybe I should take up a career in acting? I was ready to pronounce you dead about three times back there.Mia:\nMe too!Will:\nD-dead!?Mia:\nHoh hoh. Of course, we're kidding.Will:\nAre you sure?Phoenix:\n(I wasn't kidding...) Now, Mr. Powers.

Objection overruled.\nPhoenix:\n(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)Presenting wrong evidence during testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!\nJudge:\n...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Really?\nJudge:\nObjection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)Presenting wrong evidence during testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThis evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nHow exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...?\nPhoenix:\nThey aren't, are they...\nJudge:\nNot at all.

Good going, Nick!Phoenix:\nUnder the \"initial trial\" system, tomorrow is the last day we have.Maya:\n\"Initial trial\"...? What's that?Phoenix:\nThat's the new court system they introduced two or three years ago. They had so many cases in the system, they decided to speed the whole process up.Maya:\nSo, under that system, trials have to end in three days?Phoenix:\nYeah, pretty much. Well, we've no time to waste!Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Steel Samurai\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI don't get it, Maya. Why would Mr. Hammer steal the Steel Samurai costume?\nMaya:\nWhat!? You mean Mr. Hammer was wearing the costume!?\nPhoenix:\nYeah!\nMaya:\nB-but Mr. Hammer was the victim, Nick! Why would he go through the trouble of stealing it?\nPhoenix:\nThat's what we have to find out.\n\n\n\n\nThe director's alibi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nWhat happened with the director's testimony?\nPhoenix:\nWell, it's pretty clear that the producer and the director were both in the trailer.\nMaya:\nHuh...\nPhoenix:\nWhich means that the killer has to be one of them!\nMaya:\nReally!? Why?\nPhoenix:\nBecause the real scene of the crime was Studio Two... where that trailer is!\nMaya:\nWhaaaat!?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... was Maya always this excitable?)\n\n\n\n\nAny ideas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, have you noticed anything that might help us?\nMaya:\nI can't see what's going on when Mia is here...

It's a little different from the Steel Samurai on TV...\nPhoenix:\nThese are mostly taken at those PR shows they do at stores and fairs... I'm pretty sure it's not even Will Powers inside that suit.\nMaya:\nNo true fan would be satisfied with anything less than the real thing! He's still a child, I suppose...

She's well respected in the industry. They say she's a genius.\nMaya:\nA genius...?\nWill:\nShe's been at Global Studios for five years now. Right or wrong, nobody dares tell her different these days.\nPhoenix:\nWhy is that?\nWill:\nEver since she came on board, we've had nothing but hits. Global Studios was on its knees, but she picked it up and made it shine. Oh, and...\nMaya:\nAnd... what?\nWill:\nN-nothing. Forget it. I... I've only heard rumors, anyhow.\n\n\n\n\nDirector Manella\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nCan you tell me anything about Mr. Manella?\nWill:\nOh, he used to be a minor straight-to-video director. But something in his work caught Vasquez's eye. She brought the Steel Samurai idea to him. Now everyone knows the name Sal Manella. I hear he's pretty much at her beck and call, though. Whenever she says \"jump!\" he asks \"how high?\" and all that.\nPhoenix:\n(I can imagine him being at her beck and call... though I can't imagine him jumping.)\n\n\n\n\nMr. Hammer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nI was wondering about Mr. Hammer... He was a big star back in the day, right? But then he just dropped off the face of the Earth.\nWill:\nOh... Yes, you're right. In fact, he was my role model when I started in this business. But he just stopped taking on big roles. That's when he began appearing in little productions at Global...\nMaya:\nHow could he do that!? I was really looking forward to a sequel to \"Samurai Summer.\"\nWill:\nHe just gave up being a star five years ago. Actually, now that I think about it... That was right when Ms. Vasquez came to Global.\nPhoenix:\n(Five years ago...?)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPowers's(?) Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHere's that picture again.\nWill:\nI-is that really Jack Hammer inside that suit?\nPhoenix:\nHe's the only one who it could have been.\nWill:\nBut why would he...?\nMaya:\nYeah! Why?\nPhoenix:\nYou're the medium! Why don't you summon up Mr. Hammer's spirit and ask him yourself?\nMaya:\n*sigh* Gimme about three more years.\nPhoenix:\n(Look at us, the two novices.)\n\n\n\n\n\"Path to Glory\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHave you seen this, Mr. Powers?\nWill:\nW-what's that!? I've never seen these Steel Samurais in my life...\nPhoenix:\nThese are the Steel Samurais that appear at live shows. A fanboy collected all these pictures himself.\nWill:\n...

So she always gets her way.\nPhoenix:\n(She seems bitter...)\nMaya:\nDo you... not like the producer?\nOldbag:\nLook, the studio people don't want me talking about her, so, sorry.\n\n\n\n\nDirector Manella\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nCan I ask you about Sal Manella, the director?\nOldbag:\nSal? He's soft--a pushover. Does whatever Vasquez tells him to. She treats him like dirt, but I think he likes it.\nMaya:\nHuh? Why would anyone like being treated like dirt? That doesn't make any sense, does it, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nEr... No, no it doesn't, Maya.\n\n\n\n\nMr. Hammer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAbout Mr. Hammer...\nOldbag:\nArrgh! I heard about what you said today! Cheeky whippersnapper! Poor old Hammer! You'd drag his star down from the sky and stomp on it! Calling him a criminal! A thief! I-I-I-I... I won't forget this!!!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh, she's really pissed this time!)\nOldbag:\nYou listen to me, whippersnapper! My poor old Hammer would never do such a thing!

I'm not in the mood for thinking, thank you very much.October 19Studio One EntranceMaya:\nThink back, Nick, to the day of the murder... Mr. Hammer put on the Steel Samurai costume. Then he left from here to go to Studio Two...?Phoenix:\nRight.Maya:\nBut why? I wonder if someone called him...? Like the director, or the producer...?Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeft path\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nStudio Two is down that way.

They found the victim, Jack Hammer's prints on the bottle.\nMaya:\nSo that means...\nGumshoe:\nYep, it sounds like the one who put Powers to sleep was none other than... the victim!\nPhoenix:\n(So I was right!)\nSleeping Pill Bottle added to the Court Record.\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor Edgeworth (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHow is Edgeworth doing, anyway?\nGumshoe:\nMr. Edgeworth is outta control!

But I was kind of impressed at today's trial, too.\nMaya:\n...!\nGumshoe:\nMost lawyers would've given up after that director's testimony.

I thought he went to Studio One?\nMaya:\nHe stole the Steel Samurai costume, too!\nPenny:\nWhat!? Why would Mr. Hammer do something like that? ... Oh... I guess the rumor must be true, then.\nMaya:\nThe rumor?\nPenny:\nYeah. Mr. Vasquez, that producer, had some kind of hold on Hammer. She had some dirt on him... He'd do anything she said, apparently.\nMaya:\nSome \"dirt\"? What dirt!\nPenny:\n... Dirt. You know, bad stuff.\nMaya:\n... Um, I know what dirt means...\nPenny:\nAbout five years ago, they were filming a movie starring Mr. Hammer. They were using the new studio... Studio Two. Some sort of accident happened during filming. After that, they never used Studio Two again. They left the film set the way it was, too.\nPhoenix:\n(The film set...? Was that trailer part of the film set, then?)\n\n\n\n\nThe last episode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nW-what do you mean, the \"last Steel Samurai\"!?\nPenny:\nI know it's a shock, but nothing can be done to save it now. Whoever really did kill Mr. Hammer, also signed the Steel Samurai's death warrant.\nMaya:\nNo... no!\nPenny:\nAlso, I hear that Global Studios is going to change its programming. They're not going to make kids' shows anymore.\nMaya:\nW-what!? Why!?\nPenny:\nI don't know. It's sad, but that's what Global Studios decided.\n\n\n\n\nStudio policy (appears after \"The last episode\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy aren't they going to make kids' shows anymore?\nPenny:\nThe studio bigwigs don't want the Steel Samurai around anymore. They want to forget all this ever happened. They want it quiet, you understand?\nMaya:\nH-how can they just do that! What about all the kids who love the Steel Samurai!\nPenny:\nIt's okay. I'm sure the kids will be fine. They'll find a new hero to follow.\nMaya:\nNo, that can't be true! If the program just ends, they'll be heartbroken for sure! N-Nick!

Let's try that again.)\nLeads back to:\n\"I think evidence, rather than words, is called for here.\"\n\n\nPenny:\nAnd this is...?\nPhoenix:\nA fan collected all of these photographs. The kids love the Steel Samurai! The show shouldn't be cancelled just so some adults can save face! I would think you would understand that better than anyone.\nPenny:\n... ... You're right... Okay! But what can I do?\nPhoenix:\nWell, for starters... You can tell me something. Tell me what it is that Global Studios is so intent on hiding? Tell me about this accident five years ago.\nPenny:\n... Okay!\n\n\n\n\nFive years ago (appears after \"Mr. Hammer\", before clearing \"Studio policy\" Talk option)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAn accident five years ago?\nPenny:\nYes, in Studio Two. That trailer there was part of the film set.\nPhoenix:\nCould you tell us what happened?\nPenny:\n... S-sorry. I don't think I can. They really don't want us to talk about it.\n\n\n\n\nFive years ago (after clearing \"Studio policy\" Talk option)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nCould you tell us what happened five years ago?\nPenny:\nWell, I can tell you what I've heard. Apparently, five years ago, someone died... and it was Hammer's fault.\nMaya:\nS-someone died!?\nPenny:\nIt was an accident, of course! Anyway... The producer, Ms. Vasquez managed to hush it up.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that's the \"dirt\" she had on Mr. Hammer?\nMaya:\nAnd that's why Mr. Hammer would do anything Ms. Vasquez asked him to do! ... But, it was an accident, right? Why didn't they just make it public?\nPenny:\nWell, you know Mr. Hammer was a big star back then. They were afraid about what would happen to his career if word got out.\nMaya:\nI see...\nPenny:\nYou know who knows more about this? Ms. Oldbag. She was here at the studios back then, you know.\nPhoenix:\nThanks. We'll try asking her. (If she'll talk...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPowers's(?)

Today, I will call on people present in the Studio Two trailer that day. From their testimonies, the truth will become clear.Judge:\nHmm... very well!Phoenix:\n(Edgeworth seems a bit on edge today...)Judge:\nYou may call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution calls Ms. Dee Vasquez to the stand. Ms. Dee Vasquez is a producer who was present in the Studio Two trailer that day.Edgeworth:\nWill the witness state her name and occupation?Vasquez:\n... Dee Vasquez.

Remember if you will... Ms. Vasquez and Mr. Manella ate at a table outside the trailer. Yet there were no bones left on the plates! The plates were bare!Vasquez:\n!Phoenix:\nMs. Vasquez? Tell me, how can a person eat a t-bone steak... and not leave the bone? I think I know how!You ate the bone, too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYou ate the bone, too!\nMaya:\nUm, Nick... are you sure? I mean, I love steak, but even I don't eat the bone!\nPhoenix:\nHey, I don't eat it either!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! I, too, leave the bone.\nPhoenix:\nUm, can I try that again?\nLeads back to:\n\"I think I know how!\"You ate a boneless steak\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nElementary! You were eating a boneless steak!\nJudge:\n... Mr. Wright, say you are right... What would that prove?\nPhoenix:\n... Um, right, Your Honor.\nMaya:\nNick! Remember her testimony? She said she ate a \"t-bone steak\"! She said \"bone\"!\nPhoenix:\nCorrect! I was... testing you!\nMaya:\nYeah, sure, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nSorry... Can I try that one more time?\nJudge:\n...\nLeads back to:\n\"I think I know how!\"You didn't eat the steak\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"You didn't eat any steak during that break!\"Phoenix:\nYou didn't eat any steak during that break! You took your steak and threw it somewhere... like that incinerator!Vasquez:\n! ...Judge:\nI... I see! Then what was Ms. Vasquez doing during her break?Phoenix:\nIsn't it obvious, Your Honor?Meeting the Steel Samurai\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"She was meeting with the Steel Samurai!\"Picking on Sal Manella\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nShe was picking on Mr. Manella!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright... Sometimes this court finds it hard to tell whether you are joking or being serious.\nPhoenix:\nOh...?\nJudge:\nI would prefer it if you remained serious!\nPhoenix:\nY-yes, Your Honor. I'll do my best.\nLeads to:\n\"She was meeting with the Steel Samurai!\"Phoenix:\nShe was meeting with the Steel Samurai!Judge:\nOrder! A-are you saying...!?Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor! As Ms. Vasquez left the trailer to eat her steak... She ran into the Steel Samurai! And then you did it. You killed him with your own hands!Vasquez:\n!!!Judge:\nM-Mr. Wright! I-isn't that a little presumptuous!?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nWhat kind of stunt are you trying to pull, Wright!?Vasquez:\nLet him claim what he wants.... You say I did it?Phoenix:\nYes.Vasquez:\nFascinating! And here I was worrying that today would be as boring as all the rest. ... Very well. Let us have a battle of wits, you and I.Phoenix:\n(Any day, Vasquez!)Maya:\nGood luck, Nick!Vasquez:\nLet's see... What was that murder weapon again? Oh yes, the \"Samurai Spear.\"Phoenix:\nYes...?Vasquez:\nI am, as you can see, a woman of petite stature. How could I possibly use that heavy spear as a weapon?I think you could!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's not impossible!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWell, maybe it's not impossible, but--\nVasquez:\nSilence. I'm speaking.\nEdgeworth:\nMmmph!\nVasquez:\nThe victim was stabbed through the chest from the front, yes? I believe this would indicate that the victim was aware of the killer's presence. Now, the Steel Samurai costume is quite light and mobile. Compared to the victim, I am weaker and slower... I couldn't possibly win such a fight! Not to mention, there is proof I did not have the spear! The photograph of the Steel Samurai shows that the victim himself was holding it! Or do you mean to suggest that I could have wrested it away from him?\nEdgeworth:\nY-yeah! Take that, Wright! If you still think she did it, show us proof!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... er...\nMaya:\nHey, Nick. Look at the data we have on that Samurai Spear in the Court Record. Isn't there something in there that gets to you...?\nPhoenix:\nSomething odd about the Samurai Spear...? ... Wait!\nJudge:\nSomething the matter, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nS-sorry, Your Honor. I'd like to take back my previous claim.\nJudge:\nVery well, I won't hold you to your claim. But I'm afraid I will have to penalize you.\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh...)\nEdgeworth:\nWhat's this? You're taking back your claim?\nPhoenix:\nLet's backtrack for a moment. I want to consider whether the witness could have used the Samurai Spear or not!\nLeads to:\n\"However, that has no bearing on this case!\"You couldn't, could you\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI think you would have a great deal of difficulty using that as a weapon. Pretty much anyone would.\nVasquez:\nHah. You see?\nPhoenix:\nYes...\nLeads to:\n\"However, that has no bearing on this case!\"I don't know\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI don't know.\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou \"don't know\"!? What kind of a lawyer are you!?\nVasquez:\nQuiet. I'm speaking.\nEdgeworth:\nM-m-mmph!\nVasquez:\nYou \"don't know\"!? What kind of a lawyer...\nPhoenix:\nI don't know whether you could have fought with the Samurai Spear...\nLeads to:\n\"However, that has no bearing on this case!\"Phoenix:\nHowever, that has no bearing on this case!Vasquez:\n... Meaning?Phoenix:\nThe Samurai Spear was not the murder weapon!Vasquez:\nWhat!?Judge:\nWhat is the meaning of this!? The spear was found lying next to the victim's body!Phoenix:\nI have proof, Your Honor. I can prove that the Samurai Spear was not used as the murder weapon!Present Samurai Spear\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I present my proof: the so-called \"murder weapon\"!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nWrong, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nBut I haven't said anything yet...?\nJudge:\nI know you well enough by now to know when you're going to present the wrong evidence.\nMaya:\nI can sense it too, with my Fey blood...\nPhoenix:\n(Okay, okay, so I picked the wrong evidence! Enough with all the sensing!) Right. Okay, here's the real evidence, Your Honor.\nLeads back to:\n\"I can prove that the Samurai Spear was not used as the murder weapon!\"Phoenix:\nI present my proof: the so-called \"murder weapon\"!Edgeworth:\nB-but, that IS the murder weapon!Phoenix:\nNot so fast. Remember that this spear broke during the morning action scene run-through? But, someone fixed the spear. It was the security lady! She fixed it with duct tape! Now tell me, how is it possible... for someone to stab a man who is wearing a thick costume with this!? Through the chest!Judge:\nO-order! Order!Edgeworth:\nMr. Wright! What are you driving at!? Think about what you're--Vasquez:\nSilence! I'm the one testifying here and I will be heard!Edgeworth:\nMmmph...!Vasquez:\nAre you quite sane? Are you even aware of what you're saying? If the Samurai Spear was not the murder weapon, then pray tell what was!? How was Hammer killed?Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Can you tell us what weapon was used to kill Mr. Hammer?I can tell you\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Would I make a claim like that if I couldn't tell you what the weapon was?\"I can't tell you\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOf course I can't.\nJudge:\n\"O-of course\"!?\nEdgeworth:\nCan the antics, Wright!\nJudge:\nI have to agree, Mr. Wright. At least pretend that you think you might know!\nPhoenix:\n(Urk. Note to self: think before speaking. Tough crowd...)\nLeads back to:\n\"Well, Mr. Wright? Can you tell us what weapon was used to kill Mr. Hammer?\"Phoenix:\nWould I make a claim like that if I couldn't tell you what the weapon was?Judge:\nI'm afraid your confidence can sometimes be unfounded, Mr. Wright... Very well, let's see this murder weapon, then.Present Five-Year-Old Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Look at this photo.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nMaya:\nNick! Think about this some more!\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Think?\nMaya:\nPlease! How could that possibly have been the murder weapon!?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm. She has a point.)\nJudge:\nSomething the matter?\nPhoenix:\nN-no, Your Honor. Nothing!\nLeads back to:\n\"Very well, let's see this murder weapon, then.\"Phoenix:\nLook at this photo.Judge:\nW-what is this? Why, that's Jack Hammer standing at the top of the stairs! O-order! Order! If I cannot have order this trial will be suspended! Mr. Wright! What is this all about!?Phoenix:\nThis photograph is from five years ago. There was an unfortunate accident at Global Studios. This is a photo of that very accident. Not a word of this was leaked to the outside. It was a close-kept secret at the studios.Edgeworth:\nWhat does this have to do with the current case!?Phoenix:\nMr. Edgeworth... You still can't see it? See the fallen man in this photo? See how the fencepost pierced him through the chest?Edgeworth:\nWh... what!? Are you saying...!?Phoenix:\nYes. What happened five years ago... has happened again!Vasquez:\n!!!Judge:\nMr. Wright! Continue!Phoenix:\nIt's 2:30 PM on the day of the murder! Ms. Dee Vasquez meets Jack Hammer outside the Studio Two trailer! Then she did it! She pushed Mr. Hammer off the stairs onto the fence! Just like Mr. Hammer had himself done five years ago! Though whether she did it on purpose or by accident, I cannot say.Vasquez:\n...!Edgeworth:\nI-in other words... th-the victim, Mr. Hammer... He died in the same way that he caused another man to die... five years ago!Phoenix:\nPrecisely. Ironic, isn't it?Vasquez:\n... Hoh hoh. Very creative, Mr. Wright. I could use a man like you on my script writing staff.Phoenix:\nYou deny that what I say is true?Vasquez:\n... Mr. Wright. Let's say, for the sake of argument, that Hammer died at the trailer as you say. Yet the body was found at Studio One, was it not? And in the Evil Magistrate's costume, no less. Are you then claiming that I carried the body to Studio One... And returned to the trailer all in the space of a 15 minute break? How could I have disposed of the body!?Phoenix:\n...Edgeworth:\nThe break in the meeting at the trailer lasted 15 minutes, from 2:30 to 2:45. Could Jack Hammer have been pushed off the stairs to his death... then carried to Studio One and placed inside his costume? There wasn't enough time!Judge:\nHmm... indeed. Well, Mr. Wright? How could she have dealt with the body?She couldn't deal with it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n15 minutes is kind of a short amount of time...\nVasquez:\nYou see? Even I cannot do the impossible. Therefore, Mr. Wright. I didn't do it. Agreed?\nPhoenix:\nNot agreed!\nVasquez:\n?\nLeads to:\n\"What if she had another way to carry the body, other than with her own hands?\"I bet she could move it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYou'd be surprised! I bet she could do it! When people think their life depends on it, they can do amazing things!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, this is not an episode of \"That's Incredible.\"\nEdgeworth:\nIf you claim she did everything in 15 minutes...\nPhoenix:\n(Let me guess: \"Show Me Proof!\")\nEdgeworth:\nCorrect! Show me proof!\nPhoenix:\n(How am I supposed to do that...?)\nEdgeworth:\nThen I won't have you making any unsubstantiated claims!\nPhoenix:\n(... Wait a second, how does he know what I'm thinking!?)\nEdgeworth:\nHah! I need only look at the cold sweat running down your face to know what you're thinking!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. Perhaps you'd like to reconsider your claim?\nLeads back to:\n\"Well, Mr. Wright? How could she have dealt with the body?\"She had another way\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"What if she had another way to carry the body, other than with her own hands?\"Phoenix:\nWhat if she had another way to carry the body, other than with her own hands?Vasquez:\nFor instance?Phoenix:\nActually, for that matter, there was no need for her to do the deed in 15 minutes! And there was a way for you to carry that body.Vasquez:\n!!! I-interesting! Let's hear it then.Judge:\nMr. Wright? Please show us how she carried the body.Present Van\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Vasquez.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDee Vasquez used this to carry the body to Studio One!\nVasquez:\n...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright...\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor?\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, how can you carry a dead body with that?\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nJudge:\nPlease rethink your statement.\nLeads back to:\n\"Please show us how she carried the body.\"Phoenix:\nMs. Vasquez. You carried the body to Studio One. And you used the studio van to do it!Vasquez:\n!!!Phoenix:\nRecall your testimony...Vasquez:\nThere was to be a rehearsal afterwards, so we went to Studio One. I was fatigued, so I had Sal take me. There was a van there, right? I had Sal drive me.Phoenix:\nYou used the van to carry the body to Studio One! Then, before everyone else got there, you put the body into the Magistrate costume!Vasquez:\n...!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nHold on, Wright! Don't forget, it was Sal Manella that drove the van! Are you suggesting that Mr. Manella was a conspirator?Of course he was\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Of course, Sal Manella has to have been a conspirator!\"Of course he wasn't\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOf course he wasn't!\nEdgeworth:\nHah! So, without Mr. Manella noticing anything, she put the body in the van... Then managed to put the body into the costume...? Are you seriously suggesting that is possible!?\nPhoenix:\n... Of course I'm not serious.\nEdgeworth:\nHa... hah!?\nPhoenix:\nI was kidding. To, er, lighten up the proceedings.\nEdgeworth:\nLi..light... Lighten!? Y-you can't lighten up a murder!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. The court requests you refrain from making claims in jest.\nPhoenix:\nY-yes, Your Honor.\nLeads to:\n\"Of course, Sal Manella has to have been a conspirator!\"Phoenix:\nOf course, Sal Manella has to have been a conspirator! The body had to be placed in the van, and put into the costume. There's no way Ms. Vasquez could have done that alone! Also, don't forget that they had to dispose of the Steel Samurai costume. They had to... because it was covered in Mr. Hammer's blood! They probably burned it in that small incinerator. Well, Ms. Vasquez! Shall I continue?Vasquez:\n... No need. You're smarter than you look, Mr. Wright. Hmph. I lose. You win. It... was fun.Phoenix:\n(I... win!?) ...Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\n......Phoenix:\nUmm... So... what happens next?Vasquez:\n?Phoenix:\nDon't \"?\" me! Don't you have anything to say!?Vasquez:\nWhat would you like me to say?Phoenix:\nHuh? \"I lost\"? Something like that!Vasquez:\nI just said that.Phoenix:\nW-wait, so you mean... Dee Vasquez! So, it was you? You killed Jack Hammer! ...Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\n......Vasquez:\nWho can say?Phoenix:\nHuh?Vasquez:\nAre you sure I did? Mr. Wright... We just engaged in a battle of wits. And the result of that battle? You proved the possibility that I murdered Hammer.Phoenix:\nR-right!Vasquez:\nBut... that is only a possibility. Proof is another thing altogether. You lack decisive proof, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nWha... wha... wha... wha... WHAAAAAAAAAT!?Judge:\nOrder! Mr. Edgeworth, your thoughts?Edgeworth:\nUmm... uhh... mmmph. O-of course, it's as the witness says! ... Certainly, it does seem very likely she did it... but, uh, there's no proof!Phoenix:\n(...! Edgeworth isn't sure!)Vasquez:\n... Well? I came here as a witness today. If you've no more questions, I'll be leaving.Phoenix:\n(Urk! What do I do now!?)You did it, Vasquez!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMs. Vasquez! You did it!\nVasquez:\n... That wasn't a question.\nPhoenix:\n... Um, did you do it?\nVasquez:\nNo.\nJudge:\nMr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nY-yes, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nI'm not sure that question helped this court get any closer to a verdict.\nLeads back to:\n\"Urk! What do I do now!?\"Testify again, Vasquez!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI... I'd like you to testify again!\nJudge:\nTestify... again?\nVasquez:\nKnow when to give up, Mr. Wright. Think about it. Even if I were to testify again, what's the point? I can only say what I said before. The truth, Mr. Wright. I've already said all there is to say. What would happen if I said it again?\nPhoenix:\nUh...\nVasquez:\nYou'd ask the same questions, get the same answers. A waste of time.\nLeads to:\n\"Damn... damn!\"No further questions, Vasquez!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\nYes, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nI was hoping I'd come up with a question while pounding on my desk. I didn't.\nJudge:\n... You have my sympathies.\nLeads to:\n\"Damn... damn!\"Phoenix:\n(Damn... damn! To come so far, only to fail...)Judge:\nAs it seems there are no further questions... I would like to end the cross-examination of the witness, Ms. Vasquez.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nYes, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nI was hoping I'd come up with a question while I was objecting, Your Honor... I didn't.Judge:\nI see... Very well.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nYour Honor! I request that the witness testify again!Vasquez:\nYou are the prosecutor, are you not? Why are you badgering me? I'm your witness!Edgeworth:\nI... I just want to hear your testimony again.Vasquez:\nDoes this make any sense to you, Your Honor? I don't see that we have anything to gain by repeating the last several minutes.Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth... I, too, see little point in making Ms. Vasquez repeat herself. What exactly did you want her to testify about?Edgeworth:\nMmmph! Well, yes, um... ... Indeed! Verily, I say... Ergo! I want to hear about what happened... after they found the body!Judge:\nAfter they found the body...? Very well. The witness will testify to the court concerning this matter.Vasquez:\nHmph.Maya:\nNick! Why did Edgeworth...?Phoenix:\nWho knows? He probably realized she did it, too.Maya:\nBut... but! Wasn't he the one that said he always gets a guilty verdict...? After all that...Phoenix:\n(Edgeworth...)Witness Testimony-- After Finding the Body --Vasquez:\nI was with Sal and Oldbag, the security lady, when we found the body.\nThe assistant was there, too. Only Powers was absent.\nI immediately called the police. Then Powers showed up.\nThe security lady, Oldbag, was quite agitated. Pointing at Powers, saying \"he did it!\"\nI asked to be left out of the proceedings.\nI went back to the trailer to get my script and direction notes.\nThen I went home.Judge:\nHmm... I see no issues raised by this testimony... Mr. Wright, your cross-examination.Maya:\nOkay, Nick, we're close, real close! She may be acting tough now... But if you put her on the spot she's sure to falter! Find the key you need and twist the truth out of her, Nick!Phoenix:\nRight!Cross Examination",

Are you always this... terse?\nVasquez:\nYes.\nPhoenix:\n(Oh dear...)Vasquez:\nThe meeting began at 12:00 sharp. It ended at 4:00..Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid no one leave during the meeting?\nVasquez:\nNo one. ...\nPhoenix:\n... C-come on... let's talk a bit more about that.\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nThe witness did not come here to engage in idle conversation! Stop interrupting the testimony.\nVasquez:\nThe same could be said to you, Mr. Edgeworth. And please stop banging on your little desk. It hurts my ears.\nEdgeworth:\nMmph!Vasquez:\nThere was to be a rehearsal afterwards, so we went to Studio One.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd when exactly was that?\nVasquez:\nI've forgotten.\nPhoenix:\n...\nVasquez:\n...\nPhoenix:\nMaybe you could try remembering?\nVasquez:\nNo.\nEdgeworth:\nThe meeting ended at 4:00, and the rehearsal was scheduled for 5:00... I would think it was between those times.\nPhoenix:\n(You \"would think\"!? C'mon, all you did was state the obvious, Edgeworth!)Vasquez:\nI was fatigued, so I had Sal take me.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHold on! You had Sal \"take\" you? What does that mean!?\nVasquez:\nIt means what I just said. I had Sal take me in the Studio Two van.\nPhoenix:\n(Oh... oh, right.)Vasquez:\nAt 2:30, we took a 15-minute break in the meeting.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd what were you doing during that time...?\nVasquez:\nDon't hit your desk. It irritates me.\nEdgeworth:\nYeah! Mr. Wright...! Oops.\nVasquez:\n... It was a 15 minute break...Vasquez:\nSal and I ate t-bone steaks on the table in front of the trailer.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDo you have someone who can verify this?\nVasquez:\nSal.\nPhoenix:\nN-no...

She said she ate a \"t-bone steak\"! She said \"bone\"!\nPhoenix:\nCorrect! I was... testing you!\nMaya:\nYeah, sure, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nSorry... Can I try that one more time?\nJudge:\n...\nLeads back to:\n\"I think I know how!\"You didn't eat the steak\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"You didn't eat any steak during that break!\"Phoenix:\nYou didn't eat any steak during that break! You took your steak and threw it somewhere... like that incinerator!Vasquez:\n! ...Judge:\nI... I see! Then what was Ms. Vasquez doing during her break?Phoenix:\nIsn't it obvious, Your Honor?Meeting the Steel Samurai\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"She was meeting with the Steel Samurai!\"Picking on Sal Manella\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nShe was picking on Mr. Manella!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright... Sometimes this court finds it hard to tell whether you are joking or being serious.\nPhoenix:\nOh...?\nJudge:\nI would prefer it if you remained serious!\nPhoenix:\nY-yes, Your Honor. I'll do my best.\nLeads to:\n\"She was meeting with the Steel Samurai!\"Phoenix:\nShe was meeting with the Steel Samurai!Judge:\nOrder! A-are you saying...!?Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor! As Ms. Vasquez left the trailer to eat her steak... She ran into the Steel Samurai! And then you did it. You killed him with your own hands!Vasquez:\n!!!Judge:\nM-Mr. Wright! I-isn't that a little presumptuous!?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nWhat kind of stunt are you trying to pull, Wright!?Vasquez:\nLet him claim what he wants.... You say I did it?Phoenix:\nYes.Vasquez:\nFascinating! And here I was worrying that today would be as boring as all the rest. ... Very well. Let us have a battle of wits, you and I.Phoenix:\n(Any day, Vasquez!)Maya:\nGood luck, Nick!Vasquez:\nLet's see... What was that murder weapon again? Oh yes, the \"Samurai Spear.\"Phoenix:\nYes...?Vasquez:\nI am, as you can see, a woman of petite stature. How could I possibly use that heavy spear as a weapon?I think you could!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt's not impossible!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nWell, maybe it's not impossible, but--\nVasquez:\nSilence. I'm speaking.\nEdgeworth:\nMmmph!\nVasquez:\nThe victim was stabbed through the chest from the front, yes? I believe this would indicate that the victim was aware of the killer's presence. Now, the Steel Samurai costume is quite light and mobile. Compared to the victim, I am weaker and slower... I couldn't possibly win such a fight! Not to mention, there is proof I did not have the spear! The photograph of the Steel Samurai shows that the victim himself was holding it! Or do you mean to suggest that I could have wrested it away from him?\nEdgeworth:\nY-yeah! Take that, Wright! If you still think she did it, show us proof!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... er...\nMaya:\nHey, Nick. Look at the data we have on that Samurai Spear in the Court Record. Isn't there something in there that gets to you...?\nPhoenix:\nSomething odd about the Samurai Spear...? ... Wait!\nJudge:\nSomething the matter, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nS-sorry, Your Honor. I'd like to take back my previous claim.\nJudge:\nVery well, I won't hold you to your claim. But I'm afraid I will have to penalize you.\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh...)\nEdgeworth:\nWhat's this? You're taking back your claim?\nPhoenix:\nLet's backtrack for a moment. I want to consider whether the witness could have used the Samurai Spear or not!\nLeads to:\n\"However, that has no bearing on this case!\"You couldn't, could you\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI think you would have a great deal of difficulty using that as a weapon. Pretty much anyone would.\nVasquez:\nHah. You see?\nPhoenix:\nYes...\nLeads to:\n\"However, that has no bearing on this case!\"I don't know\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI don't know.\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYou \"don't know\"!? What kind of a lawyer are you!?\nVasquez:\nQuiet. I'm speaking.\nEdgeworth:\nM-m-mmph!\nVasquez:\nYou \"don't know\"!? What kind of a lawyer...\nPhoenix:\nI don't know whether you could have fought with the Samurai Spear...\nLeads to:\n\"However, that has no bearing on this case!\"Phoenix:\nHowever, that has no bearing on this case!Vasquez:\n... Meaning?Phoenix:\nThe Samurai Spear was not the murder weapon!Vasquez:\nWhat!?Judge:\nWhat is the meaning of this!? The spear was found lying next to the victim's body!Phoenix:\nI have proof, Your Honor. I can prove that the Samurai Spear was not used as the murder weapon!Present Samurai Spear\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I present my proof: the so-called \"murder weapon\"!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nJudge:\nWrong, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nBut I haven't said anything yet...?\nJudge:\nI know you well enough by now to know when you're going to present the wrong evidence.\nMaya:\nI can sense it too, with my Fey blood...\nPhoenix:\n(Okay, okay, so I picked the wrong evidence! Enough with all the sensing!) Right. Okay, here's the real evidence, Your Honor.\nLeads back to:\n\"I can prove that the Samurai Spear was not used as the murder weapon!\"Phoenix:\nI present my proof: the so-called \"murder weapon\"!Edgeworth:\nB-but, that IS the murder weapon!Phoenix:\nNot so fast. Remember that this spear broke during the morning action scene run-through? But, someone fixed the spear. It was the security lady! She fixed it with duct tape! Now tell me, how is it possible... for someone to stab a man who is wearing a thick costume with this!? Through the chest!Judge:\nO-order! Order!Edgeworth:\nMr. Wright! What are you driving at!? Think about what you're--Vasquez:\nSilence! I'm the one testifying here and I will be heard!Edgeworth:\nMmmph...!Vasquez:\nAre you quite sane? Are you even aware of what you're saying? If the Samurai Spear was not the murder weapon, then pray tell what was!? How was Hammer killed?Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Can you tell us what weapon was used to kill Mr. Hammer?I can tell you\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Would I make a claim like that if I couldn't tell you what the weapon was?\"I can't tell you\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOf course I can't.\nJudge:\n\"O-of course\"!?\nEdgeworth:\nCan the antics, Wright!\nJudge:\nI have to agree, Mr. Wright. At least pretend that you think you might know!\nPhoenix:\n(Urk. Note to self: think before speaking. Tough crowd...)\nLeads back to:\n\"Well, Mr. Wright? Can you tell us what weapon was used to kill Mr. Hammer?\"Phoenix:\nWould I make a claim like that if I couldn't tell you what the weapon was?Judge:\nI'm afraid your confidence can sometimes be unfounded, Mr. Wright... Very well, let's see this murder weapon, then.Present Five-Year-Old Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Look at this photo.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nMaya:\nNick! Think about this some more!\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Think?\nMaya:\nPlease! How could that possibly have been the murder weapon!?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm. She has a point.)\nJudge:\nSomething the matter?\nPhoenix:\nN-no, Your Honor. Nothing!\nLeads back to:\n\"Very well, let's see this murder weapon, then.\"Phoenix:\nLook at this photo.Judge:\nW-what is this? Why, that's Jack Hammer standing at the top of the stairs! O-order! Order! If I cannot have order this trial will be suspended! Mr. Wright! What is this all about!?Phoenix:\nThis photograph is from five years ago. There was an unfortunate accident at Global Studios. This is a photo of that very accident. Not a word of this was leaked to the outside. It was a close-kept secret at the studios.Edgeworth:\nWhat does this have to do with the current case!?Phoenix:\nMr. Edgeworth... You still can't see it? See the fallen man in this photo? See how the fencepost pierced him through the chest?Edgeworth:\nWh... what!? Are you saying...!?Phoenix:\nYes. What happened five years ago... has happened again!Vasquez:\n!!!Judge:\nMr. Wright! Continue!Phoenix:\nIt's 2:30 PM on the day of the murder! Ms. Dee Vasquez meets Jack Hammer outside the Studio Two trailer! Then she did it! She pushed Mr. Hammer off the stairs onto the fence! Just like Mr. Hammer had himself done five years ago! Though whether she did it on purpose or by accident, I cannot say.Vasquez:\n...!Edgeworth:\nI-in other words... th-the victim, Mr. Hammer... He died in the same way that he caused another man to die... five years ago!Phoenix:\nPrecisely. Ironic, isn't it?Vasquez:\n... Hoh hoh. Very creative, Mr. Wright. I could use a man like you on my script writing staff.Phoenix:\nYou deny that what I say is true?Vasquez:\n... Mr. Wright. Let's say, for the sake of argument, that Hammer died at the trailer as you say. Yet the body was found at Studio One, was it not? And in the Evil Magistrate's costume, no less. Are you then claiming that I carried the body to Studio One... And returned to the trailer all in the space of a 15 minute break? How could I have disposed of the body!?Phoenix:\n...Edgeworth:\nThe break in the meeting at the trailer lasted 15 minutes, from 2:30 to 2:45. Could Jack Hammer have been pushed off the stairs to his death... then carried to Studio One and placed inside his costume? There wasn't enough time!Judge:\nHmm... indeed. Well, Mr. Wright? How could she have dealt with the body?She couldn't deal with it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n15 minutes is kind of a short amount of time...\nVasquez:\nYou see? Even I cannot do the impossible. Therefore, Mr. Wright. I didn't do it. Agreed?\nPhoenix:\nNot agreed!\nVasquez:\n?\nLeads to:\n\"What if she had another way to carry the body, other than with her own hands?\"I bet she could move it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYou'd be surprised! I bet she could do it! When people think their life depends on it, they can do amazing things!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, this is not an episode of \"That's Incredible.\"\nEdgeworth:\nIf you claim she did everything in 15 minutes...\nPhoenix:\n(Let me guess: \"Show Me Proof!\")\nEdgeworth:\nCorrect! Show me proof!\nPhoenix:\n(How am I supposed to do that...?)\nEdgeworth:\nThen I won't have you making any unsubstantiated claims!\nPhoenix:\n(... Wait a second, how does he know what I'm thinking!?)\nEdgeworth:\nHah! I need only look at the cold sweat running down your face to know what you're thinking!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. Perhaps you'd like to reconsider your claim?\nLeads back to:\n\"Well, Mr. Wright? How could she have dealt with the body?\"She had another way\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"What if she had another way to carry the body, other than with her own hands?\"Phoenix:\nWhat if she had another way to carry the body, other than with her own hands?Vasquez:\nFor instance?Phoenix:\nActually, for that matter, there was no need for her to do the deed in 15 minutes! And there was a way for you to carry that body.Vasquez:\n!!! I-interesting! Let's hear it then.Judge:\nMr. Wright? Please show us how she carried the body.Present Van\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Vasquez.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDee Vasquez used this to carry the body to Studio One!\nVasquez:\n...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright...\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor?\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, how can you carry a dead body with that?\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nJudge:\nPlease rethink your statement.\nLeads back to:\n\"Please show us how she carried the body.\"Phoenix:\nMs. Vasquez. You carried the body to Studio One. And you used the studio van to do it!Vasquez:\n!!!Phoenix:\nRecall your testimony...Vasquez:\nThere was to be a rehearsal afterwards, so we went to Studio One. I was fatigued, so I had Sal take me. There was a van there, right? I had Sal drive me.Phoenix:\nYou used the van to carry the body to Studio One! Then, before everyone else got there, you put the body into the Magistrate costume!Vasquez:\n...!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nHold on, Wright! Don't forget, it was Sal Manella that drove the van! Are you suggesting that Mr. Manella was a conspirator?Of course he was\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Of course, Sal Manella has to have been a conspirator!\"Of course he wasn't\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOf course he wasn't!\nEdgeworth:\nHah! So, without Mr. Manella noticing anything, she put the body in the van... Then managed to put the body into the costume...? Are you seriously suggesting that is possible!?\nPhoenix:\n... Of course I'm not serious.\nEdgeworth:\nHa... hah!?\nPhoenix:\nI was kidding. To, er, lighten up the proceedings.\nEdgeworth:\nLi..light... Lighten!? Y-you can't lighten up a murder!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. The court requests you refrain from making claims in jest.\nPhoenix:\nY-yes, Your Honor.\nLeads to:\n\"Of course, Sal Manella has to have been a conspirator!\"Phoenix:\nOf course, Sal Manella has to have been a conspirator! The body had to be placed in the van, and put into the costume. There's no way Ms. Vasquez could have done that alone! Also, don't forget that they had to dispose of the Steel Samurai costume. They had to... because it was covered in Mr. Hammer's blood! They probably burned it in that small incinerator. Well, Ms. Vasquez! Shall I continue?Vasquez:\n... No need. You're smarter than you look, Mr. Wright. Hmph. I lose. You win. It... was fun.Phoenix:\n(I... win!?) ...Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\n......Phoenix:\nUmm... So... what happens next?Vasquez:\n?Phoenix:\nDon't \"?\" me! Don't you have anything to say!?Vasquez:\nWhat would you like me to say?Phoenix:\nHuh? \"I lost\"? Something like that!Vasquez:\nI just said that.Phoenix:\nW-wait, so you mean... Dee Vasquez! So, it was you? You killed Jack Hammer! ...Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\n......Vasquez:\nWho can say?Phoenix:\nHuh?Vasquez:\nAre you sure I did? Mr. Wright... We just engaged in a battle of wits. And the result of that battle? You proved the possibility that I murdered Hammer.Phoenix:\nR-right!Vasquez:\nBut... that is only a possibility. Proof is another thing altogether. You lack decisive proof, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nWha... wha... wha... wha... WHAAAAAAAAAT!?Judge:\nOrder! Mr. Edgeworth, your thoughts?Edgeworth:\nUmm... uhh... mmmph. O-of course, it's as the witness says! ... Certainly, it does seem very likely she did it... but, uh, there's no proof!Phoenix:\n(...! Edgeworth isn't sure!)Vasquez:\n... Well? I came here as a witness today. If you've no more questions, I'll be leaving.Phoenix:\n(Urk! What do I do now!?)You did it, Vasquez!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMs. Vasquez! You did it!\nVasquez:\n... That wasn't a question.\nPhoenix:\n... Um, did you do it?\nVasquez:\nNo.\nJudge:\nMr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nY-yes, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nI'm not sure that question helped this court get any closer to a verdict.\nLeads back to:\n\"Urk! What do I do now!?\"Testify again, Vasquez!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI... I'd like you to testify again!\nJudge:\nTestify... again?\nVasquez:\nKnow when to give up, Mr. Wright. Think about it. Even if I were to testify again, what's the point? I can only say what I said before. The truth, Mr. Wright. I've already said all there is to say. What would happen if I said it again?\nPhoenix:\nUh...\nVasquez:\nYou'd ask the same questions, get the same answers. A waste of time.\nLeads to:\n\"Damn... damn!\"No further questions, Vasquez!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\nYes, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nI was hoping I'd come up with a question while pounding on my desk. I didn't.\nJudge:\n... You have my sympathies.\nLeads to:\n\"Damn... damn!\"Phoenix:\n(Damn... damn! To come so far, only to fail...)Judge:\nAs it seems there are no further questions... I would like to end the cross-examination of the witness, Ms. Vasquez.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\n...Judge:\nYes, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nI was hoping I'd come up with a question while I was objecting, Your Honor... I didn't.Judge:\nI see... Very well.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nYour Honor! I request that the witness testify again!Vasquez:\nYou are the prosecutor, are you not? Why are you badgering me? I'm your witness!Edgeworth:\nI... I just want to hear your testimony again.Vasquez:\nDoes this make any sense to you, Your Honor? I don't see that we have anything to gain by repeating the last several minutes.Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth... I, too, see little point in making Ms. Vasquez repeat herself. What exactly did you want her to testify about?Edgeworth:\nMmmph! Well, yes, um... ... Indeed! Verily, I say... Ergo! I want to hear about what happened... after they found the body!Judge:\nAfter they found the body...? Very well. The witness will testify to the court concerning this matter.Vasquez:\nHmph.Maya:\nNick! Why did Edgeworth...?Phoenix:\nWho knows? He probably realized she did it, too.Maya:\nBut... but! Wasn't he the one that said he always gets a guilty verdict...? After all that...Phoenix:\n(Edgeworth...)Witness Testimony-- After Finding the Body --Vasquez:\nI was with Sal and Oldbag, the security lady, when we found the body.\nThe assistant was there, too. Only Powers was absent.\nI immediately called the police. Then Powers showed up.\nThe security lady, Oldbag, was quite agitated. Pointing at Powers, saying \"he did it!\"\nI asked to be left out of the proceedings.\nI went back to the trailer to get my script and direction notes.\nThen I went home.Judge:\nHmm... I see no issues raised by this testimony... Mr. Wright, your cross-examination.Maya:\nOkay, Nick, we're close, real close! She may be acting tough now... But if you put her on the spot she's sure to falter! Find the key you need and twist the truth out of her, Nick!Phoenix:\nRight!Cross Examination",

Her desire to disengage from the situation itself seems suspicious.\n\nLet's focus on:\n- **The Van (8):** Vasquez would need to use the van to transport the body again as part of the cleanup or cover-up, possibly inconsistent with simply collecting scripts\u2014consider the logistics and travel she describes.\n  \nChallenging the movement or inconsistency directly:\n- Ms. Vasquez states she \"went home,\" yet actions around this timing (like the use of the van) need concrete validation. There's a discrepancy in what could be performed in that time frame, especially when integrating travel details and locations (not directly visible in current statements). \n   \nTherefore, presenting \"the van\" evidence against the statement about her actions after finding the body might highlight timeline inconsistencies or reveal discrepancies in movement logistics Ms. Vasquez is unlikely to have overlooked without misuse or deliberate action contrary to her story.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"present\",\n  \"testimony\": 5,\n  \"evidence\": 8\n}\n```"

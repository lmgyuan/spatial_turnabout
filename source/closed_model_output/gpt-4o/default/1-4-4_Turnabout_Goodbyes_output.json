You can't imagine how much I've suffered...You... suffered?And now... the perfect opportunity presents itself. At last... I shall have my revenge!What!?...Merry Christmas.December 25, 10:08 AMWright & Co. Law OfficesMaya:\nHey, hey, Nick! Do you know if there's any good waterfalls around here?Phoenix:\nWaterfalls...? Dare I ask why?Maya:\nDuh, Nick! Isn't it obvious? I need a waterfall to stand under! Preferably a freezing one!Phoenix:\n... Oh... Is that part of your spirit medium training?Maya:\nOf course! Except, I've been slacking off lately... I need to brave the elements and be forged anew under the rushing spring waters!Phoenix:\nUmm... Okay... I don't know about any falls per se, but Gourd Lake is pretty close...Maya:\nOh. Darn.Phoenix:\nSorry, but them's the breaks. Couldn't you just take a cold shower or something?Maya:\n... Good idea!Phoenix:\n(So much for the rushing spring waters...)TV:\nNext in the news... A large, unidentified animal was sighted at Gourd Lake! The town is buzzing with excitement! Locals are calling it \"Gourdy\" in a tip of the hat to Nessie, the Loch Ness monster. Though its namesake, Nessie, proved to be a hoax... locals are confident their Gourdy is the real deal. ...Phoenix:\n*yawn* Bor-ing. Can't they show real news for a change?Maya:\nNick?Phoenix:\n?Maya:\nThe water pressure's kind of low in that shower.Phoenix:\n... You want more pressure, huh? Why don't you go down to the fire department and have them spray you with the hose?Maya:\n... Good idea, Nick!Phoenix:\n(Apparently, Fey blood is no aid in detecting sarcasm...) (Changed from [Apparently, E.S.P. is no aid in detecting sarcasm...] in the original release)TV:\nWe interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin! Strange occurrences continue at Gourd Lake... But this time, it's murder!Phoenix:\n(Gourd Lake again?)TV:\nThe body of a man was found in the lake early this morning. A suspect was apprehended. Sources inside the police department revealed... that the suspect's name is Miles Edgeworth, age 24. Edgeworth was an up-and-coming prosecution attorney, known for his skill and connections. He was guaranteed a long and rewarding career... Has he thrown it all away?Phoenix:\n(...? E-Edgeworth!?) What's going on!? Edgeworth would never do something like--Maya:\nNick?Phoenix:\nYipes! M-Maya!Maya:\nThe fireman yelled at me when I called him.Phoenix:\nWe've got bigger things to worry about than that! They arrested Edgeworth!Maya:\nWhat? You mean, the prosecutor?Phoenix:\nYeah, he's a suspect... in a murder!Maya:\nWhaaaaat!? When? Where? Whom? Why? How?Phoenix:\nI-I don't know!Maya:\nLet's go find out, Nick!Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBookshelf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nDifficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. I tried reading one, and it made my head hurt. When I closed it, it slipped out of my hand. Then my foot hurt too.\n\n\n\n\nCharley the plant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMia's favorite plant. Its name is \"Charley.\" Maya's gotten the knack of watering it lately. Charley's been perking up these days.\n\n\n\n\nDesk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMia's desk. If we had more clients, I would probably sit here more often. Lately, I've been spending more time on the couch, watching TV.\n\n\n\n\nMovie poster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMaya brought in a poster of the Steel Samurai the other day. We had a big fight over whether to put it up or not. I know she's just waiting for a chance to sneak it up on the wall.\n\n\n\n\nWindow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nLooks like it's cleaning day again at the hotel across the way. I hear they're planning a second branch outside the city. I can see the bellboy, getting the angle of that screwdriver in the drawer just right.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to do\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, what should we do?\nMaya:\nWhat do you mean!? Let's investigate! We should talk to Mr. Edgeworth, and check out the crime scene!\nPhoenix:\n(You're right... We need more information! Save aimlessness and confusion for later!)\n\n\n\n\nAny ideas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell? Got any good ideas?\nMaya:\nNot really. I do my best thinking when I'm standing underneath a waterfall.Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYou know, I think it's developing a nice luster.\nMaya:\nI'll look at your badge later, Nick. We've got work to do!\nPhoenix:\n(I suppose you're right...)December 25Detention CenterVisitor's RoomMaya:\nYou know, Nick... We've all been in here one time or another, haven't we?Phoenix:\nI guess it comes with the territory.Maya:\nI'm not sure it's something we should mention to too many people... Aah!Phoenix:\n... Hey! Edgeworth! Come back!Edgeworth:\nWhat are you doing here!?Maya:\nNick, I don't think he's in a very good mood.Phoenix:\nWell, he is in detention. Were you in a good mood when you were here?Edgeworth:\nSo, you've come to laugh at the fallen attorney? Then laugh, laugh! Well? Why aren't you laughing?Maya:\nNick... Should we be laughing?Phoenix:\nNah. It's a trick. Laugh and he'll get mad... or burst into tears. Edgeworth. We don't have so much free time we can spend it coming down here to laugh at you.Edgeworth:\n... Yes you do.Phoenix:\n(Actually, he's right.)Edgeworth:\n... I hoped you wouldn't come. I didn't want you to see me. Not like this.Phoenix:\n(I didn't want to see you like this, either. Believe me.) (Changed from [Hey, I didn't want to see you either, believe me.] in the original release)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurveillance camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSmile for the camera...\n\n\n\n\nSecurity guard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch since I came in. A real pro. Or maybe he's just nervous with Edgeworth in the room.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth. Tell me what happened.\nEdgeworth:\n... Why should I? What are you going to do about it?\nMaya:\nDuh! We're going to help you, that's what!\nEdgeworth:\n...! ... Help me? You? Don't be ridiculous.\nPhoenix:\nSorry...?\nEdgeworth:\nYou're a novice! You've only been in three trials!\nPhoenix:\nH-hey!\nEdgeworth:\nSure, you got lucky and won all three... But your luck's bound to run out some day! You need real skill, Wright. Experience!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nNick! He's insulting you! Nick? Why am I always the one who has to get angry!?\n\n\n\n\nGourd Lake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe murder took place at Gourd Lake, correct?\nEdgeworth:\nYes... late last night.\nPhoenix:\nThe lake is a long way away from your offices and the court... Why were you down there?\nEdgeworth:\n... I see no need to tell you.\nMaya:\nM-Mr. Edgeworth! You... you didn't really...?\nEdgeworth:\n... Gourdy.\nMaya:\nHuh?\nEdgeworth:\nI went to see Gourdy.\nMaya:\n\"Gourdy\"? What's that!?\nPhoenix:\nI'll... tell you later. (Why won't Edgeworth talk to us?)\n\n\n\n\nDid you do it (appears after \"What happened\", \"Gourd Lake\", and presenting Attorney's Badge)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth... this is really hard for me to ask... But... you didn't do it, right? Right?\nEdgeworth:\n... Think what you will. I have only one request.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEdgeworth:\nStay out of this case.\nMaya:\nWhy!? B-but Nick is trying to help you!\nEdgeworth:\nI know...! I know that! But I don't want your help, okay?\nMaya:\n\n\n\nWhy not?\nEdgeworth:\n... Look, just go away, and leave me alone!\nMaya:\nNick... Mr. Edgeworth did it, didn't he.\nPhoenix:\nMaya! Let's go investigate elsewhere.\nMaya:\nBut, Nick...Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYour attorney's badge...?\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth. Let me defend you.\nEdgeworth:\n... Hah! Hah hah! Good one, Wright. But I'm not that hard up. Not yet.\nMaya:\nWh-what do you mean by that?\nEdgeworth:\nMe? Trust a wet-behind-the-ears lawyer with only three trials under his belt? Never!\nMaya:\nWh-what!?\nEdgeworth:\nMy case is near hopeless, Wright. Every defense attorney I've talked to has turned me down.\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nEdgeworth:\nSimply put, they were afraid they'd lose. It occurred to me that it might be my fault that they lack confidence. After all, I did get every single one of their clients declared \"guilty.\"\nPhoenix:\nI don't believe it!\nEdgeworth:\nRegardless, I don't want you involved in this. You in particular I cannot ask to do this.December 25Gourd Lake ParkEntranceMaya:\nThis is where it happened?Phoenix:\nYeah. Gourd Lake is in the middle of this park.Maya:\nI can see some police walking around in there.Phoenix:\nQuestioning people, probably.Maya:\nHey! Isn't that Detective Gumshoe over there?Gumshoe:\nWell, pal!? There's enough of us here! Anyone found anything?Police:\nS-sorry, sir... Nothing.Gumshoe:\nIdiot! The trial's tomorrow! We need clues, on the double!Police:\nB-but, sir... There weren't any clues... that's why we arrested that attorney, Mr. Edgeworth! It's clear, sir. He's the one who--Gumshoe:\nShaddup! Just you try saying that again! I'll... I'll... I'll make you sorry if you do! (Changed from [I'll... er... I'll make you sorry if you do!] in the original release) So just... just, get outta my face, pal! (Changed from [I mean... just, get outta my face, pal!] in the original release)Police:\nY-yes, sir!Maya:\nDetective Gumshoe's kinda scary today!Gumshoe:\nRecruits... peh! ... Aah!Maya:\nEek!Gumshoe:\nHey, you're that Harry guy! Harry Butz!Phoenix:\nWright! Phoenix Wright! (Will he ever learn my name!?)Gumshoe:\nAnd just what are you doing here, pal? Investigating!?Phoenix:\nHuh? Um, well, yes. I suppose.Gumshoe:\nWell, I'm here to help! Ask me anything you want! Bring it!Maya:\nHe seems different than usual. I wonder what's up? Umm... Mr. Edgeworth hasn't actually asked us to defend him yet...Gumshoe:\nHuh!? Oh? Y-you don't say...Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrees\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI feel winter's chill from the bare leaf trees today... *sigh* What is it about winter that turns people into poets?\nMaya:\nI don't know, but my toes are starting to feel numb.\nPhoenix:\n(Yes... my poetry has that effect on some people.)\n\n\n\n\nSign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe sign says \"Gourd Lake Nature Park.\" This place is full of families picnicking on the weekend.\nMaya:\nBut... no waterfall.\nPhoenix:\nNot many picnickers come here for spiritual training, Maya.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe? Do you know what happened here?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? You don't know, pal?\nPhoenix:\nNo...\nGumshoe:\nWow, okay, Mr. Head-in-the-fluffy-pink-clouds Lawyer.\nPhoenix:\nHead-in-the... huh?\nGumshoe:\nNever mind, I'll tell you. It happened last night, about 15 minutes after midnight. There was a boat out on Gourd Lake. In that boat were two men. One of those men shot the other with a pistol.\nMaya:\nAnd... the shooter was Mr. Edgeworth?\nGumshoe:\nA cop who arrived on the scene arrested him.\nMaya:\nHow did they get there so fast? (Changed from [How did he get there so fast?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nWell... There was a witness. When the report came in, we raced to the lake.\nPhoenix:\nA witness?\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nYou don't think Mr. Edgeworth is a... murderer, do you!? (Changed from [You don't think Mr. Edgeworth is a... murderer!?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nAbsolutely not! It's impossible! I don't care if there's a witness either! I don't believe a lick of it!\nMaya:\nR-right! Who cares what the witness says!\nPhoenix:\n(I care!)\nMaya:\n... You really believe in him, don't you, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nCourse I do! But... the police are pretty sure he's the killer. Nobody's even really taking this investigation that seriously.\nMaya:\nOh no!\nGumshoe:\nAfter all the help Mr. Edgeworth has been to us... Hard to imagine that no one's standing up to take his side.\nMaya:\nWell, at least you are, Detective. At least you are.\n\n\n\n\nDefense request\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nDo you know who will be Mr. Edgeworth's defense attorney in tomorrow's trial?\nGumshoe:\nHe hasn't got one yet.\nMaya:\nWhat? The trial IS tomorrow, isn't it?\nGumshoe:\nWell, I don't know the whole story... But apparently no one he's been talking to will take his case.\nMaya:\nW-why not?\nGumshoe:\nMr. Edgeworth won't tell me! When you guys showed up, I figured he'd asked you to defend him.\nPhoenix:\nU-unfortunately not...\nGumshoe:\nWell, pal, then you got a job to do! Help out Mr. Edgeworth! Prove that badge you wear isn't just some fancy piece of metal! Prove it to me, pal! Show me you're an attorney!\n\n\n\n\nDefense request (after presenting Attorney's Badge in Detention Center - Visitor's Room)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nI-is it true? No one will take Mr. Edgeworth's case?\nGumshoe:\nYeah... He's a bit of a celebrity. If you defended him, and lost, your reputation'd be sure to suffer. What's more... The case against him is... well, it's pretty solid.\nPhoenix:\n(I suppose it would be if they have a witness.)\nGumshoe:\nHey! Pal! Don't tell me your going to turn your back on him too!? Remember the Steel Samurai case? (Changed from [Remember the Steel Samurai!] in the original release) Mr. Edgeworth helped you get your client declared innocent!\nPhoenix:\nI... I know. I went to Edgeworth. I tried. He really doesn't want us to represent him. Especially not us, he said.\nGumshoe:\nWhat!? W-well, that doesn't make any sense, pal! You should have heard him talking about you after that trial! (Changed from [You should have heard him talking about you after the Steel Samurai case!] in the original release) He kept saying \"Wright, Wright, Wright,\" over and over.\nMaya:\n... Nick? I'm not sure that's a good sign.\nPhoenix:\nNeither am I...\nGumshoe:\nWhy wouldn't he want your help? I don't get it.\n\n\n\n\nThe witness (appears after \"What happened\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWho was this witness?\nGumshoe:\nEr, sorry, pal. That's confidential. Anyway, the witness saw everything, apparently. I'm sure they'll turn up at the trial tomorrow.\nPhoenix:\nWas there only that one witness?\nGumshoe:\nYep. It was pretty cold out on the lake last night. And, it was Christmas Eve after all. Still, we're being thorough. You never know when you're going to turn up another witness. That's why we're here today, checking things out. So far, we're coming up empty...\nMaya:\nOh! It's Christmas today! I'd forgotten. What are you getting me for Christmas, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nTalk to Santa.Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThat badge! You're showing that to the wrong guy, pal! You gotta show that to someone who needs it!After clearing all Talk options:Police:\nDetective Gumshoe, sir!Gumshoe:\nWhat? Find something!?Police:\nUm, no, sir. Not yet. But there was a call from the precinct. They want to hold an investigation briefing...Gumshoe:\nA briefing? Right! I'm off! Oh... Sorry, pal. I guess you heard. I gotta go. Any last things you want to ask me about before I head back?The autopsy report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nWell, yes. Do you have any information on the victim...?\nGumshoe:\nSorry... They haven't worked up the autopsy report yet. I'm still waiting for it myself. Actually... Say, if you get the time, drop by the precinct! We can talk more there, pal!\nLeads to:\n\"You're not coming back, Detective?\"How to get in touch with you\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"You're not coming back, Detective?\"Phoenix:\nYou're not coming back, Detective?Gumshoe:\nErm... Probably not, pal.Phoenix:\nSo, what should we do if we have something to talk to you about...?Gumshoe:\nAh, right. Here, I'll show you how to get to the precinct. Come down and see me anytime.Detective Gumshoe gave you directions to the police station.Phoenix:\nOh, hey! Detective Gumshoe!Gumshoe:\nW-what!?Phoenix:\nUm, we'd like to take a look around in the park. Can we walk around?Gumshoe:\nYeah! No problem, pal. You got my permission.Maya:\nYou know, Nick. I think there's something to be said for talking to people when they're busy.Phoenix:\nYeah. They don't have time to think about not giving you information...Maya:\nRight! Now, let's get investigating!December 25Police DepartmentCriminal AffairsMaya:\n... Looks like Detective Gumshoe isn't here.Chief:\nSomething wrong, miss? Hmm? Turning yourself in? Okay, what did you do? Shoplifting? Larceny? Public indecency...?Maya:\nN-no! None of those things! We're looking for Detective Gumshoe... is he around?Chief:\nGumshoe? Oh yeah. He's in a meeting right now. I don't think he'll be out any time soon.Maya:\nOkay, we'll come back.Chief:\nYou do that. Oh, and go straight home and stay out of trouble. No more shoplifting, you got that?Maya:\n... Do I look like a criminal or something?Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA poster of a female police officer... Wait, no. That's the latest \"Babes in Uniform\" calendar. My bad.\n\n\n\n\nDetective\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThat must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.\nPolice:\n\"...your mama could see you know she'd be crying'... ...a break and spit it out, you lowlife scumbag...\"\nPhoenix:\n... He must be doing image training for interrogations.\n\n\n\n\nDesk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThese are the detectives' desks. There are computers and files on each one. Funny, they're a lot tidier than I'd expect. I guess the detectives don't spend a lot of time at their desks.\n\n\n\n\nBlue Badger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHey, is that the police department's mascot...?\nChief:\nThat's the \"Blue Badger\"! It was my idea! I made it! It's my mascot!\nPhoenix:\nI... see. How nice.\nChief:\nI'll get him assigned mascot of the Criminal Affairs Dept. if it's the last thing I do!\nPhoenix:\nUm, good luck!\n\n\n\n\nChief\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThis must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen.\nChief:\nWha...!? \"Gourd Lake...!\" \"Gourdy sighted\"!!! I don't believe it!\nPhoenix:\n(Shouldn't you be reading something more important...?)December 25Gourd LakePublic BeachMaya:\nWowsers! This is \"Gourd Lake\"?Phoenix:\nYup. I'm not sure it warrants a \"wowsers,\" though.Maya:\nHmm. Probably not. But hey, look at that snack stand!Phoenix:\n\"Samurai Dogs\"...?Maya:\nI wanna Samurai Dog! Please! I bet they're great!Phoenix:\nWith a name like Samurai Dog, how could they not be?Maya:\nThey're a little behind the times, though. The kids are all into \"The Pink Princess\" now. I mean, like, y'know!?Phoenix:\n(Nope.)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nWow. Gourd Lake is really big.\nPhoenix:\nYeah.\nMaya:\nSay, Nick. Why is it called \"Gourd Lake\"?\nPhoenix:\nOh. Well, a long time ago, they used to grow gourds here.\nMaya:\nWhoa! No way! I was sure it was because the lake looked like a gourd when viewed from above! You know, like an hourglass shape?\nPhoenix:\nWell, it is shaped like a gourd, actually. But that's just a coincidence.\nMaya:\nOh. Okay.\n\n\n\n\nTrash can\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe trashcan is empty. At least the place is well maintained.\n\n\n\n\nBench\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA lineup of plastic benches. I guess the idea is you buy a dog and eat it here. I doubt anyone would sit here and eat on a day like this. Except maybe Maya... if she had a Samurai Dog.\n\n\n\n\nSign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHuh... I almost didn't see that signpost. \"Left - Boat docks\" \"Right - Exit\"\n\n\n\n\nVendor stand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA hotdog stand. It's closed... The Christmas fringe looks a little half-baked. The banner reads \"Samurai Dogs\"... Somebody needs to redecorate.\n\n\n\n\nPopper\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nHuh. Someone left some poppers here. You know, you pull the string... (Changed from [Huh. Someone left one of those poppers here. You know, you pull the string...] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n...And it goes \"pop.\" Yeah, I know the ones. You see them a lot around New Year's.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! They might be a clue! (Changed from [Hey, Nick! It might be a clue!] in the original release) Let's take them. (Changed from [Let's take it.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nC'mon, admit it. You just want to pop them, right? (Changed from [C'mon, admit it. You just want to pop it, right?] in the original release)\nMaya:\nWas it that obvious?\nPhoenix:\n(Poppers... hmm.) (Changed from [A popper... hmm.] in the original release)\n\n\n\nTake them (Changed from [Take it] in the original release)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI suppose it couldn't hurt. Huh? Where'd they go?

I'm not in the mood for idle banter, Wright.December 25Boat Rental ShopMaya:\nNick... what is this place?Phoenix:\nA boat rental shop. Closed for Christmas it seems. I guess a murder taking place on one of the boats won't be good for business, either.Maya:\nBoats... I've never ridden on a boat.Phoenix:\nReally? Well, how about we go out on one when the trial is finished?Maya:\nHey, good idea! You bet!Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrees\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere's more forest off that way. I doubt I'd find any helpful clues in there.\n\n\n\n\nShop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA small boat rental shop. Doesn't look like anyone is around. They're probably closed because it's Christmas.\n\n\n\n\nBoats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere are some boats floating at the dock. Was one of these boats used in the murder, I wonder?\nMaya:\nNick?\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nMaya:\nI changed my mind. I don't really want to go for a boat ride.December 25Gourd Lake WoodsMaya:\nI like it here, Nick. Look... someone's camping!Phoenix:\nThey've got guts, camping at the scene of a murder.Maya:\nHey, hey, Nick! If they were camping here last night, they might know about the murder!Phoenix:\n(That's true...) Good call, Maya. Let's go talk to them.Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCamera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nHey, Nick. Check out this camera!\nPhoenix:\nYeah... what's with the big mic and that box on top, I wonder? It looks like some sort of automatic system for taking a photo when a noise is heard.\nMaya:\nWow! Hey, let's see if it works! *cough* \"Hi, I'm Nick!\" ... Maybe I'm not saying it loud enough. \"YO! I'M NICK!!!\" ... Huh. NIIIIIIIIII......IIIIIIIIIICK!\nPhoenix:\nWill you stop that?\nMaya:\nI think it's broken, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nD-don't kick it! (It must not be set up to respond to voices.)\n\n\n\n\nCamera (after Popper is added to the Court Record)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"This camera has a mic and some sort of attachment.\"\n\n\n\n\nTrees\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe trees grow quite thick here. Further back, the trees fade into the shadow where the sunlight can't reach them.\n\n\n\n\nSign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe sign says \"No Camping.\" Funny place to pick to pitch your tent.\nMaya:\nWait, what if the sign said \"No Setting Tents on Fire\"?\nPhoenix:\n... I don't think they have signs like that.\nMaya:\nOh...\n\n\n\n\nSheet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere's food and some magazines on the sheet.

Yeah, his methods might be a little extreme at times. But... there's a reason! He trusts our investigation, see? He trusts us to get the right man! That's why I work extra hard, pal.

Wait... you don't mean? Was that medium my mother?\nGrossberg:\nYes, my dear. The spirit medium, Misty Fey, your mother, contacted the spirit of the victim. But... the case was a loss.

Right before my eyes... He was shot and killed, and I saw it all.\nMaya:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nMy memories from that time are... foggy. I suppose it's a self-defense mechanism. In any case, a suspect was arrested... a man. It's pretty clear he was the only one who could have killed my father. The spirit medium they used to talk to my late father said the same thing. It was an attorney by the name of Robert Hammond that cleared the suspect's name.\nPhoenix:\nAnd Hammond... is the victim in the Gourd Lake murder?\nEdgeworth:\nCorrect.\nMaya:\nUmm... That spirit medium... that was my mom.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat? You mean you're...? ... It's strange.

What does that mean?\nPhoenix:\nWhen a case's statute of limitations runs out, legally, the case never happened.\nEdgeworth:\nThree days from now, DL-6 will be closed... forever.\n\n\n\n\nThe suspect (appears after \"The DL-6 Incident\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nWhat happened to the suspect? The one who got off innocent?\nEdgeworth:\nI don't know... He disappeared from public view. Nobody knows where to. If he's still alive, he'd be about 50 years old now.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I can understand why he'd go into hiding... It'd be hard to live a normal life after being a murder suspect in such a big case.)\n\n\n\n\nYour father (appears after \"The DL-6 Incident\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nUmm... so, was your father a lawyer?\nEdgeworth:\nHe was...

Once you start on something, you always see it through, don't you?\nPhoenix:\nAbout the \"DL-6 Incident\"...\nEdgeworth:\nRight... DL-6. I didn't want you to find out about it. That is why I refused your offer to defend me. I'm sorry if it sounded like I thought you weren't up to the job. I just wanted to keep you away from DL-6.\nPhoenix:\nSo... do you still think it would have been better for me to stay away?\nEdgeworth:\nI don't know. But...

Great. Just great.)\nGumshoe:\nIn any case, she's going to be the one testifying tomorrow.\nMaya:\nHuh? What happened to the other witness?\nGumshoe:\nWell...

Manfred von Karma is a man to be feared.Phoenix:\n(That's quite a claim coming from someone who forges evidence...)Edgeworth:\nHe taught me what it really means to \"prosecute.\"Phoenix:\nWh-what!?Edgeworth:\nJust picture a prosecutor as vicious as me... multiplied by a factor of ten.Maya:\nUgh...

The murder happened late Christmas Eve, around midnight. There was one boat in the very middle of the lake. There were two men on the boat. Now, there happened to be a woman camping here on the edge of the lake. At 12:10 AM, she heard two pistol shots. Then the boat started to move.

That is a vital piece of information. Please revise your testimony.\nGumshoe:\nRight! S-sorry, Your Honor.\nChanges statement from \"So we had to arrest Mr. Edgeworth.\" to \"The murder weapon we found in the boat was decisive evidence.\"Gumshoe:\nThe murder weapon we found in the boat was decisive evidence.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat about the pistol made it \"decisive evidence\"?\nKarma:\nTsk tsk tsk...\nPhoenix:\n(Ack! He has the same evil laugh as Edgeworth...)\nGumshoe:\nThere were fingerprints on the pistol found in the boat. They were clear prints from Mr. Edgeworth's right hand.\nPhoenix:\nWh-what!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! So Mr. Edgeworth's fingerprints were found on the murder weapon!?\nGumshoe:\nY-yes, Your Honor.\nKarma:\nJudge!

His testimony's probably filled with landmines just waiting for me to press.Maya:\nWhat do we do?Phoenix:\nGrit our teeth and press, I guess. What else can we do?Maya:\nWell said, Nick! You're the man!After pressing fifth statement and pressing modified sixth statement:Karma:\nMembers of the court... We now have the pistol used in the murder, and the bullet found in the body! Detective!Gumshoe:\nY-y-yessir!Karma:\nWas the bullet found in the body fired from this pistol?Gumshoe:\nYes. The ballistic markings on the bullet match the pistol.Judge:\nHmm...Maya:\nHey, Nick! What does he mean, \"ballistic markings\"?Karma:\nShocking! To imagine someone here does not know something as basic as ballistic markings!Maya:\nN-Nick! He's glaring at me!Karma:\nTsk... very well, I'll explain. Actually, Judge! You do it.Judge:\nEh? M-me? ... Erm, ahem. Ballistic markings are like the \"fingerprints\" of a gun. The barrel leaves distinctive marks on each bullet it fires. You can examine these \"ballistic fingerprints\" to see which gun fired the shot. It's quite accurate.Karma:\nIndeed. This leads to one, inevitable conclusion: the bullet found in the victim's heart... was, without a doubt, fired from this pistol. This pistol which, as you may recall, was covered with the defendant's own fingerprints!Judge:\nO-order! Order!Phoenix:\n(This is bad... This makes it look like Edgeworth did it!)Karma:\nWell, Judge?Judge:\nI'd say it's almost decisive, yes. Honestly, I could declare a verdict at this point. However...Karma:\nYou wish to hear the witness speak, no doubt. Very well. I am somewhat fatigued, and so I will take a brief break. I will call my witness after the recess. Which will last ten minutes. Judge!Judge:\nY-yes?Karma:\nWhat are you doing? A ten minute recess! Now!Judge:\nB-but, wait, I...Karma:\nJust bang your flimsy gavel and get on with it, man!Judge:\nY-yes! Ahem.

Your fingerprints were on the murder weapon!Edgeworth:\nUh... hmm...Phoenix:\nAnd that foggy photo makes one thing clear... The only one who could have shot that man was the person in the photo!Edgeworth:\nTrue...Phoenix:\nWas that you in the boat?Edgeworth:\n... Yes. It was me.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Edgeworth:\nBut... you must believe me. I didn't shoot him.Phoenix:\nTh-then who did!?Edgeworth:\nI... don't know.Phoenix:\nYou don't know!? Weren't you right there!?Edgeworth:\n... I heard a gunshot from very close by. Then... the other man fell from the boat. I can't say why, but... I thought, at the time, that he had shot himself!Phoenix:\nY-you mean it was a suicide!?Edgeworth:\n... That's the only explanation I can come up with.Phoenix:\nHuh... (How am I going to convince anyone of that!?) Say, Maya?Maya:\nHuh? Wh-what?Phoenix:\nAny progress with Mia?Maya:\nOh... Sorry. It's no good.Phoenix:\nUgh...Maya:\nI know... I'm no good for anything, am I, Nick? If I can't call my sister, I might as well not be here, right?No, I need you here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nNo, of course not, I need you here! I can see you're always trying to help out. Even if you don't actually help... it's the thought that counts, right?\nMaya:\nIt's okay Nick, you don't have to make me feel better.\nLeads to:\n\"I don't know anything about trials, or defense...\"Yeah, you're useless\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm, well, actually... (You don't know law, you don't have any trial experience or techniques... Yeah, you're pretty much useless... but I can't say that!)\nMaya:\nIt's okay Nick. You don't have to say anything. Your face said it for you.\nPhoenix:\n(Whoops!) N-no, o-of course we... I'm sorry.\nMaya:\nIt's okay Nick.\nLeads to:\n\"I don't know anything about trials, or defense...\"Maya:\nI don't know anything about trials, or defense...

S-sorry... (Whoops!)Judge:\nCourt is back in session. Mr. von Karma, call your witness.Karma:\nYes. Will Ms. Lotta Hart take the stand?Karma:\nLotta Hart, you are a research student at a university?Lotta:\nThat I am.Karma:\nGood. Begin by telling us what you saw the night of the incident. And don't add anything trivial or subjective. Understand?Lotta:\n... Y'all need to learn some manners.Karma:\nUNDERSTAND?Lotta:\nY-yeah, I understand, I understand!Judge:\nEr... very well. Your testimony, please.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Lotta:\nIt was Christmas Eve, just after midnight, I reckon.\nI was in my car.\nI heard this \"bang\" come up from the lake.\nWhen I looked out the window, I saw two gents in a boat.\nThen there was another \"bang\"...\nThere wasn't nary a thing on the lake but that boat.Karma:\nEnough.Lotta:\nHuh?Karma:\nJudge! She happened to take a photo of the incident! This is that photo. Accept it as evidence.Judge:\nW-well! This is a surprise! This looks like... the very moment of the murder! O-Order! I will remove you from the court if I do not have order immediately!Karma:\nAs the witness testified, she looked at the lake when she heard the shot. There were no other boats on that lake! So, the man in the boat with the victim must have been the one who shot him... Yes. It was the defendant, Miles Edgeworth!!!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order...! I will have order!Karma:\n... Well, Judge?Judge:\nThe evidence is... decisive. I have very little doubt about this case. Very well, this court finds the defendant...Phoenix:Phoenix:\nW-wait! Your Honor! I haven't cross-examined the witness yet!Karma:\nA cross-examination? We have photographic proof! What question can there possibly be!? This photo is worth a thousand words... and they all read \"guilty\"! You lose. Or... Do you claim to have found a contradiction in her testimony!?Phoenix:\n...!Karma:\nVery well. If you have to, you may cross-examine the witness. You will only flounder and ask meaningless questions! You will fail to find anything! And then, I will have you held in contempt of court!Maya:\nUh, Nick... contempt...?Phoenix:\n\"Contempt of court,\" you know?Maya:\nI... guess I understand. Well... what are you going to do? Do you really think there was a contradiction with the facts in her testimony?I think there was\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI... think I noticed one little thing...\nMaya:\nWow, I'm impressed, Nick! I didn't notice anything! Right! Let's take him on!\nPhoenix:\nY-yeah... (I got a bad feeling about this...)\nLeads to:\n\"I understand... I will cross-examine the witness!\"I think there wasn't\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHonestly, I found nothing.\nMaya:\nI dunno, I thought her testimony was strange. She was so vague about everything!\nPhoenix:\nI bet von Karma probably fed her her lines.\nMaya:\nBut... But if you don't cross-examine her, the judge will...\nPhoenix:\nHe'll bang down that \"flimsy gavel\" of his and declare Edgeworth guilty.\nMaya:\nI guess we'll just have to bluff it.\nPhoenix:\nBut if we mess up... contempt of court.\nMaya:\nHey, if we lose we'll be held in public contempt!\nPhoenix:\nEr... right.\nLeads to:\n\"I understand... I will cross-examine the witness!\"Phoenix:\nI understand... I will cross-examine the witness!Karma:\nTsk tsk tsk... Very well!Judge:\nI pray for your sake this isn't a waste of time.Cross Examination-- Witness's Account --Lotta:\nIt was Christmas Eve, just after midnight, I reckon.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Just after midnight,\" you say? In other words, it was no longer Christmas Eve... but Christmas Day!\nLotta:\nHuh? Uh, yeah, well, yes.\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nI know you want to find contradictions, but really!\nPhoenix:\nMmmph.\nJudge:\nI hope your next contradiction is a little more relevant to the trial.Lotta:\nI was in my car.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy were you camping there, anyway?\nLotta:\nI'm a research student at my university. I was taking pictures to use in my research.\nPhoenix:\n(What research? This all sounds suspicious...)\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMs. Hart. Could you be more specific about your \"research\"?\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nWhat does the witness's motive in camping by the lake have to do with this case!? The answer \"is nothing\"! I object to this line of questioning! Objection sustained!\nJudge:\nW-w-wait, now, I'm the one who says that!\nKarma:\nWell, then say it already!\nJudge:\nObjection sustained.\nPhoenix:\n(Thanks for nothing, Your Honor...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nHold back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I think I'll let that one slide for now.)\nLeads back to cross-examinationLotta:\nI heard this \"bang\" come up from the lake.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, you weren't looking at the lake at that time?\nLotta:\nNope. I looked after I heard that noise.\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nShe's said that already! I asked you to find \"contradictions\"! Not leisurely chat with the witness!\nPhoenix:\n(Urk...)Lotta:\nWhen I looked out the window, I saw two gents in a boat.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nCould you clearly see the two men?\nLotta:\nJust look at the picture! Clear enough for you?\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh...)\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWait a second! I wasn't asking you about the photo! I was asking if YOU saw the two men!\nLotta:\nUh, yeah, well, of course...\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nThe witness has testified that she saw them! There's also a photo! You'd best look elsewhere for your precious contradictions!\nPhoenix:\n(He jumped in quick... He's hiding something!)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nHold back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I think I'd best let that one slide...)\nLeads back to cross-examinationLotta:\nThen there was another \"bang\"...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWere you watching the very moment the shot rang out?\nLotta:\nWell, yeah, sure...\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nYou're asking meaningless questions! Meaningless! \"Contradictions,\" Mr. Wright. Not meaningless babble!\nPhoenix:\n(von Karma, I think I hate you. He's trying to keep me from talking to the witness...

It almost sounds like she was more interested in the lake than the boat...) Ms. Hart... you--\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nMr. Wright! The witness has answered the question in full.\nPhoenix:\nMmph!\nKarma:\nNo need for further questions! Objection sustained!\nJudge:\nU-uh, that's what I'm...\nKarma:\nSustained!\nJudge:\nY-yes, of course.\nPhoenix:\n(Oh great...

I think we've heard all we need to hear, Mr. Wright. It seems you are unable to find a contradiction in the testimony worth noting.Phoenix:\nB-but, Your Honor!Karma:\nYou keep your promise!Judge:\nMr. Wright. I am afraid that I will have to penalize any further outbursts... By holding you in contempt of court!Karma:\nAnd if that happens, you'll have to leave the courtroom immediately! Understood...?Phoenix:\nUh... uh huh.Maya:\nNick...! Lotta's testimony is fishy, Nick! Real fishy!Phoenix:\nI... know what you mean. But... If I can't say anything, what can I do?Judge:\nI believe we've covered the evidence sufficiently to make a decision.Karma:\nThen, pass your judgment!Judge:\nVery well. Mr. Miles Edgeworth, please take the stand.???:Judge:\nWh-who was that!?Maya:\nIt... was me.Phoenix:\n(Maya!)Judge:\nI-is something wrong? D-do you need to use the facilities?Maya:\nNo, I do not!

This is a matter of life or death!Lotta:\n...!Maya:\nLotta! Did you really clearly see Mr. Edgeworth that night!? Did you see him fire that pistol!?Judge:\nYou will stand down!

I saw Edgeworth...Karma:Karma:\nEnough! Judge... Declare the defense in contempt of court!Judge:\nY-yes... yes, of course. I'm sorry, but you WERE warned. Guard! Escort Mr. Wright out of the courtroom! He is in contempt of court, and must leave.Phoenix:\n(No... No...!)Wait!Maya:\nI-I was the one who made the outburst, Your Honor! Nick is innocent!Karma:\nHah! What's the difference? All that remains is for the guilty verdict to be declared! Isn't that right, Mr. Phoenix Wright!?Wrong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWrong!\nKarma:\nWhat!?\nLeads to:\n\"Did you hear what Ms. Hart just said?\"Right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Dammit, he's right...)\nMaya:\nN-Nick!

Your Honor!\nLeads to:\n\"Did you hear what Ms. Hart just said?\"Phoenix:\nDid you hear what Ms. Hart just said? She said she clearly saw Mr. Edgeworth! That was not in the testimony!

Sustain my objection!Judge:\n... ... I'm sorry, Mr. von Karma, but I cannot.Karma:\nWhat!?Judge:\nMs. Lotta Hart has made a new testimony. The defense does have a right to cross-examine her again.Karma:\nB-but he is in contempt of court!Maya:\nNo, I am! If you're going to arrest someone, arrest me!Judge:\nHmm... Very well. Maya Fey!

You got what?Phoenix:\nLook at this photograph.Lotta:\nThe photo I took...?Phoenix:\nThe very same. There's something I want you to see in this photo... it's quite clearly visible. The fog, Ms. Hart.Lotta:\nSo... so?Phoenix:\nThis picture was taken with professional, high quality film, correct? Yet even it could not capture the faces of the men on the boat! Yet you claim you saw Mr. Edgeworth! How!?Lotta:\nWhut!? Wha--!Judge:\nMr. Wright has a point!Karma:Karma:\nThat's why I told her not to say that in her testimony! Please!Phoenix:\nYet, now she has said it, Mr. von Karma. How could you possibly see Mr. Edgeworth!? Explain yourself!Judge:\nMs. Hart.Lotta:\nWhat!Judge:\nCould you see the defendant that night?Lotta:\nO-of course! I said I could and I meant I could!Judge:\nThen, please testify as to the circumstances of your sighting.Phoenix:\n(I did it! I finally found a hole in von Karma's carefully vague testimony!)Witness Testimony-- How Edgeworth Was Seen --Lotta:\nYer right. It was a cold night, and the fog was thick as grits.\nSo, once I was finished setting up my camera, I got back in the car.\nStill, I brought my binoculars with me.\nWhen I heard that noise out on the lake, I looked with my binoculars.\nSee? No problem!Judge:\nHmm...You used binoculars? Very well. You may begin your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\n(This one'd better be good!)Cross Examination-- How Edgeworth Was Seen --Lotta:\nYer right. It was a cold night, and the mist was thick as grits.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo? How could you see Edgeworth!?\nLotta:\nNow, just hold your horses for a second! You hasty Yankee types'd never find a gal where I'm from.\nJudge:\nDefense attorneys have trouble with that as it is.\nPhoenix:\n(Nobody loves me...)Lotta:\nSo, once I was finished setting up my camera, I got back in the car.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYour \"camera\"...?\nLotta:\nYeah. It's got an automatic...\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nThe issue we are concerned with here is Ms. Hart seeing Mr. Edgeworth! The camera has nothing to do with this at all!\nJudge:\nObjection sustained.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh! He's not letting her answer any of my questions!)Lotta:\nStill, I brought my binoculars with me.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Binoculars\"?\nLotta:\nYeah, binoculars.\nPhoenix:\nYesterday, you mentioned that you were out looking for shooting stars, correct?\nLotta:\nWell... yeah.\nPhoenix:\nWouldn't you need a telescope, not binoculars, for that?\nLotta:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nI've got doubts about your camera, too! Was that really to take pictures of meteor showers?\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nThe camera is irrelevant to this case!\nPhoenix:\nYou can't say that for certain!\nJudge:\nHmm... Mr. Wright. Is the camera really relevant to this case? If you believe it is, you may continue with this line of questioning.\nKarma:\nBut know this! If you find nothing with this, there will be consequences!\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Do you wish to press further about the camera?\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(This is make-it-or-break-it time!) The camera is of utmost importance, Your Honor.

I guess I wasn't thinking too straight! Har!\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nMr. Wright! I will not have you badgering my witness because of her challenged intellect!\nLotta:\nNow wait a minute!\nKarma:\nContinue your testimony.

Are all you lawyers that smart? So, smart boy, I was down there trying to photograph Gourdy, you got me. So what?Phoenix:\nHuh...?Lotta:\nThat don't change what I saw, does it?Karma:\nExactly! What you just used several precious minutes of our time to prove... is nothing more than that the witness is an idiot who thinks monsters exist!Lotta:\nH-hey!Karma:\nBut, as she so succinctly said, so what!? It changes nothing!Phoenix:\n(Not true! You were hiding the whole thing about Gourdy for some reason, I know it! But what could it have been...? Whatever it is, I'm getting to the bottom of this!)Judge:\nMs. Hart. Why did you hide the fact that you were searching for Gourdy from the court? Please revise your testimony.Lotta:\n... Right.

Well, Mr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.Karma:Karma:\nThe witness's testimony is unchanged from before! Whether she is a research student or a photographer has no bearing on this case! There is no need to waste more of our time with another pointless cross-examination!Judge:\nEr... hmm.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nI claim the defense's right to cross-examine the witness, Your Honor! (von Karma's up to something, I know it! He doesn't want me to cross-examine her because... why? Was there a contradiction?)Judge:\nVery well. You may begin the cross-examination. You seem sure of yourself, you must have something in mind.Karma:\nHah! That would be a first!Phoenix:\n(Hah hah, very funny.)Judge:\nYou understand that this is your last chance at a cross-examination, Mr. Wright? If there is no problem with the testimony this time, we will let the witness leave. I will announce my verdict at that time, Mr. Wright.

Borrowed it from a friend at a university. It analyzes every sound it picks up, and when it gets a \"bang!\"...\nPhoenix:\nIt snaps a shot.\nLotta:\nYep.\nPhoenix:\nSo, how many pictures has it taken so far?\nLotta:\nThe only time the camera triggered was that night.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm...)Lotta:\nBut, that's all I was hiding.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nI think it's time you told us why you felt you had to hide your true purpose at the lake.\nLotta:\nHeck, if word got out what I was up to, the lake'd be swarmin' with competitors!\nPhoenix:\nCompetitors...?\nLotta:\nYeah! Second-rate shutterbugs trying to steal my scoop!\nPhoenix:\nAh... Is that the only reason you were hiding the truth?\nLotta:\nW-well, actually...\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nMr. Wright! I'll not have you asking questions with no relevance to this case!!!\nPhoenix:\n(Whatever you say, von Karma.

I bet he wouldn't help them build the case against Edgeworth...)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetective\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThat must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.\nPolice:\n\"Don't do anything rash! Why jump...? ...You have every reason to live!\"\nPhoenix:\n... He must be doing image training for talking down a potential suicide.\n\n\n\n\nChief\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThis must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen.\nChief:\nWha...!? Rook to Bishop 7... Checkmate!? I don't believe it!\nPhoenix:\n(He must be playing chess on the computer...)December 26Grossberg Law OfficesPhoenix:\nApparently, Mr. Grossberg is on vacation today. Well, I guess I can come back tomorrow if I need anything.Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBookshelf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nExpensive-looking mahogany bookshelves, filled with expensive-looking books. Hmm... funny... they don't look like they've ever been read.\n\n\n\n\nDesk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA solid mahogany desk. The wood's been polished to a deep luster.\n\n\n\n\nVacant wall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI guess Mr. Grossberg isn't getting that painting back. I feel kind of bad for him...\n\n\n\n\nPotted plant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAn expensive potted plant. No idea what kind of plant it is, but it's probably the most expensive one available.\n\n\n\n\nTable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA table for clients. Hmm... an elegant ebony case, and if I'm not mistaken, that lighter's made of solid gold. Even I can tell someone here's got money to burn.December 26Gourd Lake ParkEntrancePhoenix:\nThere are fewer than there were yesterday, but the cops are still around in the park. I wonder if Detective Gumshoe is here today?Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrees\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI feel winter's chill from the bare leaf trees today... There's a lot of trees here. I guess that's why they call it a \"nature park.\" It's quite pretty when the cherry trees along the lakeside blossom in spring. Today... it's just cold.\n\n\n\n\nSign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe sign says \"Gourd Lake Nature Park.\" This place is full of families picnicking on the weekend. It's a little cold for picnicking these days, though.December 26Gourd LakePublic BeachPhoenix:\nHaven't seen Larry around at all. Probably off paying through the nose on a date with the lovely Kiyance...Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe famous Gourd Lake... Its green waters stretch out on both sides... It's a pretty big lake, really.December 26Boat Rental ShopPhoenix:\n(Looks like the boat rental shop is closed today, too.)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA small boat rental shop. Doesn't look like anyone is around. They're probably closed because of the murder.\n\n\n\n\nBoats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere are some boats floating at the dock. The murder took place in a boat from this dock... Apparently, the police took away the actual boat that was used that night. Indeed, there's space for one more boat at the dock.December 26Gourd Lake WoodsPhoenix:\nHey, Detective Gumshoe!Gumshoe:\nHey, pal! The trial today, it, er... ...Phoenix:\nYes? What about the trial?Gumshoe:\nWell, I was going to say \"good show,\" but it wasn't really all that... Though you did save Mr. Edgeworth, I guess... (Changed from [Though you did save Edgeworth, I guess...] in the original release) I just wasn't sure how to thank you... you know?Phoenix:\nEr... thanks.Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCamera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nLotta's camera is staring out at the lake, as usual. Even a novice like me can tell that camera must cost a pretty penny. I hope she doesn't leave it out here to get stolen.\n\n\n\n\nSign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe sign says \"No Camping.\" Funny place to pick to pitch your tent.\n\n\n\n\nCampfire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI wonder why she brought a camping cooker with her? There's a convenience store right up the street... I guess she wanted to get into the outdoor spirit.\n\n\n\n\nSUV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI don't think Lotta takes very good care of her SUV. It's covered with dents. I can't believe anyone would drive their car down here.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTomorrow's trial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe? Any idea what strategy von Karma is planning for tomorrow?\nGumshoe:\nIt sounds like he's bringing in another witness!\nPhoenix:\nAnother witness!? Oh, right, he said something about that in the trial today...\n\n\nKarma:\nThere were two witnesses!\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI was wondering who that other witness was! Er... who was it?\nGumshoe:\nS... sorry, pal. As much as I'd like to, I'm not at liberty to divulge that information.\nPhoenix:\n(Right...)\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor Edgeworth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOh, right... I wanted to ask you something about Edgeworth.\nGumshoe:\nWhat's up?\nPhoenix:\nIs he afraid of earthquakes? I never heard anything about that before.\nGumshoe:\n... Mr. Edgeworth doesn't talk about himself too much, see. But there's one thing that's clear as day... Him hating crime the way he does... And him becoming a lawyer... And him being scared of earthquakes... It all started with that incident.\nPhoenix:\nThe DL-6 Incident?\nGumshoe:\nYep, that's the one. Fifteen years ago... when he saw his father shot before his very eyes! He still feels the pain now, you can see it in his eyes.\n\n\n\n\nMaya Fey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI wanted to talk to you about Maya Fey...\nGumshoe:\nHuh? She's not out on bail yet? That's strange. I told 'em to let her go as soon as they had their report written up. Man... I don't know what would have happened in that courtroom today if it weren't for her. Seeing her getting dragged out by the bailiff... I'll be honest with you, pal. I shed a tear or two. Mr. Edgeworth, he was so moved I saw his lip trembling. (Changed from [Edgeworth, he was so moved I saw his lip trembling.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nReally!? (Cold-as-ice Edgeworth!?)\nGumshoe:\nHe was really grateful for what she did, you know.Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nI think it's a little early for you to be proudly waving that thing around. You can be proud of yourself when you get Mr. Edgeworth declared innocent, pal!\n\n\n\n\nLotta's Camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThat woman really took us for a ride, didn't she? Claiming she was a witness to a murder and all...\nPhoenix:\nStill, if it weren't for her photograph, Mr. Edgeworth wouldn't have made it today.\nGumshoe:\nOh, huh, really?\nPhoenix:\n(Umm... you were at the trial, weren't you, Detective?)\n\n\n\n\nRobert's Autopsy Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nRobert Hammond... He was the defense attorney in the DL-6 Incident trial. He's the one who got the sole suspect off the hook. I wonder what Mr. Edgeworth thinks of him. Not much, I'd wager.\n\n\n\n\nLake Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nI don't care who you are, no one can tell me that that's Mr. Edgeworth! I mean, come on, it doesn't look like him at all!\nPhoenix:\nBut Edgeworth has admitted he was on the boat.\nGumshoe:\nThen he's the one being shot, then!\nPhoenix:\nHe seemed fine in court today...\nGumshoe:\n... Details, pal, details! Whose side are you on, anyway?\nPhoenix:\n(All I'm saying is we have to respect the evidence...)\n\n\n\n\nPistol Bullet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nYep, it was fired from the murder weapon, without a doubt.\nPhoenix:\nFrom a meter away... so it would have to have been from someone else on the boat.\nGumshoe:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you make of this, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nHey, making something of things is your job!\nPhoenix:\nEr... right. (Since when do lawyers have to do detectives' work for them!?)\n\n\n\n\nPistol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nMaybe you should tell me why Mr. Edgeworth's prints were on the weapon, pal.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? How should I know!?\n\n\n\n\nLotta's Deposition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nNow, she heard two gunshots, right?\nPhoenix:\nBut wait... Look at the Court Record! According to this, the murder weapon was fired three times!\nGumshoe:\nWhat!? How's that possible!?\nPhoenix:\nWhere was the third shot fired?\nGumshoe:\nI wonder... Maybe it was a practice shot or something?\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nSorry to disappoint you, pal. I'm drawing a blank.After clearing all Talk options:Gumshoe:\nI'm going to head back to the station. I'll get the report on Maya and get her out of there as soon as I can.Phoenix:\nThank you. Oh, wait! Umm... I was wondering, how much is bail going to be?Gumshoe:\nDon't worry about that. Mr. Edgeworth is posting the whole amount.Phoenix:\nWhat? Edgeworth...?Gumshoe:\nDidn't I tell you? He's grateful to her for what she did. Alright, pal. Well don't forget to go pick her up, okay?Phoenix:\n(Hmm... Maybe I can get Edgeworth to pay this month's rent, too...)After clearing all Talk options in Gourd Lake Woods:December 26Detention CenterVisitor's RoomMaya:\nHey, Nick! You finally came! They just finished the paperwork, I'm free to go.Phoenix:\nFree at last, eh?Maya:\nThose interrogators were really mean! They were like \"okay, what did you do THIS time?\" Like I was some kind of criminal! Can you believe it?Phoenix:\nWell, they let you out in the end, didn't they?Maya:\nMmm... Oh, that reminds me... Thanks for bail.Phoenix:\nThank Edgeworth.Maya:\nHuh?Phoenix:\nHe posted bail for you. Said he was grateful for what you did.Maya:\nMr. Edgeworth did that...? ... I have to make it up to him! We've got to win this case, Nick!Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to do\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you think we should do next?\nMaya:\nWe're kind of lacking in the clues department. We could go to the park and look for Gourdy.\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nI-I was kidding!\nPhoenix:\nStill, if there are any clues out there, the park's as good a bet as any. What do you say? Shall we head down there?\nMaya:\nSure!\n\n\n\n\nAny ideas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHave you noticed anything lately?\nMaya:\nHmm... You know, I did notice one thing while I was here in detention. It's really pretty comfortable here. It's warm, and they keep it very clean.\nPhoenix:\nI meant have you noticed anything about the case...?\nMaya:\nWell... Not much more than that, no.\nPhoenix:\n(She's probably still upset about Mia. I should leave her alone.)Wright & Co. Law OfficesMaya:\nAhh! Fresh air! I gotta say, freedom feels great.Phoenix:\nBehave yourself in the courtroom tomorrow, okay?Maya:\nHeh heh heh. Misbehaving's much more fun.Phoenix:\nIt's not going to be so much fun when Edgeworth refuses to pay your bail again.Maya:\n... Right. I'll behave.Phoenix:\n(Oh dear...)Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to do\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, what should we do?\nMaya:\nI don't know! I've been in detention this whole time. I think I'll let you decide what we should do. Deal?\n\n\n\n\nAny ideas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell? Any thoughts you want to share?\nMaya:\nWell, I was detention all day. I think I'd like more time to think.\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Maya, she probably thought about Mia the whole time she was in there...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nDon't waste time showing me things! We have to get cracking on this case! You know the enemy has more tricks up his sleeve! He's bringing in another witness!December 26Detention CenterVisitor's RoomPhoenix:\nLooks like Edgeworth is in questioning.Maya:\nLet's come back later.Phoenix:\nGuess so...December 26Gourd Lake ParkEntranceMaya:\nThere aren't many cops around today, are there?Phoenix:\nThey're probably back at the precinct, working up the case against Edgeworth.Maya:\nMmm...Lotta:\nHey y'all!Maya:\nHey, it's Lotta!Lotta:\nY'all really did it today...Phoenix:\nWh-what did we do now?Lotta:\nNaw, I'm not complaining! See, I did a little thinking. A little... self-reflection, you might say. I realized that bein' a witness is a mighty big responsibility. But I just went up there and started blabbing any old thing that came to mind.Phoenix:\nLotta...Lotta:\nSo, you see, I want to make it up to y'all.Phoenix:\n\"Make it up\"...?Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday's trial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat did you think of the trial?\nLotta:\nTo be honest, I was doin' it half just to say I'd been a witness... Even though I didn't really see anything. I kinda convinced myself I had though... I'm sorry, I know I caused y'all a lot of trouble.\nMaya:\nWell, memory is a tricky, vague little thing.\nLotta:\nYeah, I sure know that now. I'll be fine the next time I witness a murder!\nMaya:\nRight!\nPhoenix:\n(You mean the FIRST time you witness a murder...)\n\n\n\n\nGourdy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat about Gourdy?\nLotta:\nRight! Well, the way I figure, the trial's only stoking the flames of Gourdy fever! I'll get my exclusive photos and rocket to stardom!\nMaya:\nAll right, Lotta! You go, girl! I wish I could be an investigative photographer too!\nPhoenix:\n(Finish your spirit medium training first!)\n\n\n\n\nMaking it up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nLotta, what do you mean by \"making it up to us\"?\nLotta:\nWell, ya see... Actually, I got a bit of information for you.\nMaya:\nWhat!?\nLotta:\nThat von Karma didn't want me to say nothin' about it.\nMaya:\nWh-what information!?\nLotta:\nNow we're getting to the heart of it! See, I reckoned we might be able to do ourselves a little \"exchange.\"\nPhoenix:\nE-\"exchange\"? Umm... I thought this was to \"make it up to us\"...?\nLotta:\nRight! I propose a little exchange, to make it up to you!\nPhoenix:\n...\nLotta:\nWhat!? Information don't come cheap, my friend!\nMaya:\nUh...\nLotta:\nHey! I see you thinking \"my, how unsophisticated these southern folks are\"!!! It's written all over yer face! Let me tell you, most southerners are WAY more sophisticated than you... I'm just the exception, okay? Well, what'll it be? We gonna deal, or not!?\nMaya:\nWh-what should we do, Nick?\n\n\n\nDeal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(We don't have any other leads so I don't think we have a choice here...) Okay. How much?\nLotta:\nHuh? You completely off your rocker? I may not be sophisticated, but I'm not trying to rob the poor!\nLeads to:\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\n\n\nNo deal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry... But I've no intention of dealing with you!\nMaya:\nNor do we have any money, anyway!\nLotta:\nYou guys make a fine team, you know that?

You know, I was wondering...\nLotta:\nYeah?\nMaya:\nWhat if you get a picture of Gourdy... and it turns out like this enlargement did?\nLotta:\nY'all crazy!? A blurry picture like this doesn't make a hit story! I need a picture that screams \"I am Gourdy! Hear me roar!\" I can't turn something like this into the paper! What kind of fool do y'all think I am?\nPhoenix:\n(The kind of fool that would turn a blurry picture in as evidence in a murder trial? Not to mention claiming she saw something she didn't see!)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLotta:\nYep, I'd have to say I know exactly squat about that.\nPhoenix:\n(It's painfully easy to know when something doesn't catch Lotta's interest...)Phoenix:\nHuh?Lotta:\nThe only fair exchange for information is... information! Listen good-- What I need from you is information about Gourdy!Maya:\nWhoa-whoa-whoa! G-Gourdy!?Phoenix:\nB-but Gourdy doesn't...

You mean, you don't know the War of the Eyeglasses?\nPhoenix:\nWhat the heck is it?\nMaya:\nOur local fair used to do it ever summer...

Then I heard another one. \"Bang!\" A little while later, this boat comes back. Then a young man walked by my window here. He was mutterin' something to himself, ayup.\nMaya:\nWhat did he say?\nUncle:\n... Ayup... ... I forgot.

Are you sure about this?\nPhoenix:\nHey, anything to get the case solved. Also... Who wouldn't want to eat \"Phoenix Noodles\"?\nMaya:\nI... guess so.\nUncle:\nThat's my boy!

How'd you-- Hmm. That was supposed to be top secret.\nMaya:\nDo you know who that old man is, Detective?\nGumshoe:\n... Actually... I don't. He's a bit of an odd bird... I haven't been able to get a straight answer out of him. I decided first that he wasn't persuasive enough to stand and testify as a witness. That's why we called Ms. Lotta Hart yesterday. As for who he is... We have absolutely no idea.\nMaya:\nHmm... sounds suspicious!\nGumshoe:\nHmm...\n\n\n\n\nThe DL-6 Incident\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe, please, help us...\nGumshoe:\nH-huh?\nPhoenix:\nWe need to know about the DL-6 Incident!\nGumshoe:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nThat was when Edgeworth's father died. I can't help but think that it has something to do with this current case.\nGumshoe:\n... To tell the truth, I don't know much about DL-6 either. Mr. Edgeworth forbade us from reading the file. So... I'm afraid I can't show them to you, either, pal.\nMaya:\nWhat!?\nGumshoe:\nHowever... If you can convince me somehow that the DL-6 Incident is related to this case... Well, I guess I'd consider opening the file up.Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetal Detector\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThanks, Detective Gumshoe.

A parrot?\nPhoenix:\nThe old man at the boat rental shop's parrot. The parrot knew about that \"incident\"...\nGumshoe:\nThat incident?\nPhoenix:\nDL-6.\nGumshoe:\nWh-what!?\n\n\nMaya:\nPolly! Polly! Have we forgotten something?\nParrot:\n*squawk* \"Don't forget DL-6!\" *squawk*\nMaya:\nH-huh!?\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI'm pretty sure that old man must have taught her that word...\nGumshoe:\nYeah, but how would that old man know about the DL-6 Incident?\nPhoenix:\nWait! What if... What if that old man was connected to DL-6?\nMaya:\nN-Nick! You think he might be!?\nGumshoe:\n...After clearing all Talk options and presenting Parrot:Gumshoe:\n... I get ya. Sounds like you need information on the DL-6 Incident. Through there is the Station's Records Room. I'll give you special permission to go in and find what you need.Maya:\nAll right! Way to go, Detective Gumshoe! Okay, Nick! To the Records Room!Phoenix:\n(I guess it's time we faced Edgeworth's past...)December 26Police DepartmentRecords RoomMaya:\nWow!!! It's amazing.........ly dusty.Phoenix:\nTen years of files and ten years of dust, I guess.Maya:\nLet's find that DL-6 stuff quick!Phoenix:\n(Fifteen years ago... both me and Edgeworth were nine years old. We were almost through with fourth grade when he suddenly transferred. Because of DL-6...?)Maya:\nNick! I found out where the file is!Phoenix:\nO-oh, thanks!Maya:\nJust let me know what you want to know about the DL-6 Incident! I'll go get the right file!Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlass case\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like there are files inside that glass case. The case is so dusty I can't see what's inside.\nMaya:\nNick... it's locked.\nPhoenix:\nThey must keep important case files in there.\n\n\n\n\nBack wall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere are shelves stuffed with case files in the back of the room, too. Forgotten cases, rotting away for eternity...\nMaya:\nNick, let's get what we need and get out of here. All this dust is getting to me!\n\n\n\n\nCabinet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThis cabinet is where they keep evidence for current cases. Some of the things are obviously murder weapons. Others are... who knows what. Most of it just looks like random junk.\nMaya:\nNick... what do you think this clothespin is for?\nPhoenix:\nDon't touch that! It's evidence...\n\n\n\n\nShelves\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHere are files of collected case reports. There's quite a large volume of reports here.\nMaya:\nWow... these are all case reports!?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. It's like a graveyard of police cases.\nMaya:\nI guess my sister's case report is in here too... quietly gathering dust.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe case summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, first I have to get a handle on the main facts... like a summary.\nMaya:\nRight. Summary... summary... Found it! Here you go.\nPhoenix:\nDecember 28... 2001.\nMaya:\nThat's exactly 15 years ago from the day after tomorrow!\nPhoenix:\n(So in two days, the case is closed...) The incident took place in the elevator of the district courthouse. (Changed from [The incident took place in the elevator of the district court.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nWhat!? Is this the same district courthouse where we're holding the trial now!? (Changed from [Is this the same district court where we're holding the trial now!?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nLooks like it. There was a large earthquake at 2:00 PM on that day. Part of the court building collapsed, and all of the lights went out.\nMaya:\nWow... that was some earthquake!\nPhoenix:\nAt the time, three people were trapped in the elevator. It took five hours for them to be rescued... Five hours!\nMaya:\nThat would be scary like that, in the dark!\nPhoenix:\nThere was a lack of oxygen in the elevator, and the survivors were unconscious.\nMaya:\nThe survivors...?\nPhoenix:\nOne of the three in the elevator had been shot... in the heart.\nMaya:\nThat was Mr. Edgeworth's father... wasn't it.\nPhoenix:\n(He said that his father was shot before his very eyes... So Miles Edgeworth was one of the other passengers in that elevator.)\n\n\n\n\nVictim data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nDo you have data on the victim... Edgeworth's father?\nMaya:\nYeah, hold on... Victim... victim... Here! Found it!\nPhoenix:\nGregory Edgeworth, 35, defense attorney. If he were still alive, he'd be 50. He had lost that day's case in court, and got in the elevator with his son, Miles.\nMaya:\n\"Miles\"...!\nPhoenix:\nMiles Edgeworth, of course.\nMaya:\nSo he was on the elevator with his father!\nPhoenix:\nFrom the angle of the bullet and the other evidence, it could not have been a suicide... The murder weapon, a pistol, was found in the elevator. The pistol had been fired two times. (Where have I heard that before...? Huh...! It sounds just like this current case! What's going on here?)\n\n\n\n\nSuspect data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nGot any data on the suspect in there?\nMaya:\nHmm... that would be the guy that my mom got arrested. Hold on... this is it.\nPhoenix:\nThe man arrested as a suspect in DL-6 was... Yanni Yogi? He was a clerk in the court, apparently.\nMaya:\nSo he must have been the third person in the elevator. Well, then he had to have done it!\nPhoenix:\nBut... he was found innocent. Thanks to his defense lawyer, Robert Hammond.\nMaya:\nHammond... the victim in our case!\nPhoenix:\nRight. The suspect, Mr. Yogi was oxygen deprived... so much so he had brain damage. He lost all memory of being in the elevator. After he was declared innocent, he disappeared.\nMaya:\nHmm... where could Yogi have gone to, I wonder?\nPhoenix:\n(He may be closer than we think...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nLet's just hurry up and read these files! This place is so dusty, I want to finish up and get out of here...After clearing all Talk options:Phoenix:\nI guess I know generally what happened in DL-6 now. I still don't know what sort of impact the whole thing had on Edgeworth...Maya:\nNick. Are we going to take the whole file? There's too much! We'll never get it out.Phoenix:\nY-you're right. How about we just take what we think we'll need...DL-6 Case File added to the Court Record.Phoenix:\nRight. That's probably all we'll be able to find here. Now, all that's left is the trial tomorrow... I wonder how \"Dad\" will do testifying in court...To be continued.Nothing to examine during investigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nNo clues here.Turnabout Goodbyes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranscriptPart 1\n\nPart 2\n\nPart 3\n\nPart 4\n\nPart 5\n\nPart 6December 27, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Miles Edgeworth.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Karma:\n... ...Judge:\nVery well, apparently the prosecution is also ready.Phoenix:\n(Who is the judge here, anyway!?)Judge:\nMr. von Karma, your opening statement.Karma:\n... ...Judge:\nEr... very well, no opening statement so...Karma:Karma:\nNot so fast, Judge!

You can't imagine how much I've suffered...You... suffered?And now... the perfect opportunity presents itself. At last... I shall have my revenge!What!?...Merry Christmas.December 25, 10:08 AMWright & Co. Law OfficesMaya:\nHey, hey, Nick! Do you know if there's any good waterfalls around here?Phoenix:\nWaterfalls...? Dare I ask why?Maya:\nDuh, Nick! Isn't it obvious? I need a waterfall to stand under! Preferably a freezing one!Phoenix:\n... Oh... Is that part of your spirit medium training?Maya:\nOf course! Except, I've been slacking off lately... I need to brave the elements and be forged anew under the rushing spring waters!Phoenix:\nUmm... Okay... I don't know about any falls per se, but Gourd Lake is pretty close...Maya:\nOh. Darn.Phoenix:\nSorry, but them's the breaks. Couldn't you just take a cold shower or something?Maya:\n... Good idea!Phoenix:\n(So much for the rushing spring waters...)TV:\nNext in the news... A large, unidentified animal was sighted at Gourd Lake! The town is buzzing with excitement! Locals are calling it \"Gourdy\" in a tip of the hat to Nessie, the Loch Ness monster. Though its namesake, Nessie, proved to be a hoax... locals are confident their Gourdy is the real deal. ...Phoenix:\n*yawn* Bor-ing. Can't they show real news for a change?Maya:\nNick?Phoenix:\n?Maya:\nThe water pressure's kind of low in that shower.Phoenix:\n... You want more pressure, huh? Why don't you go down to the fire department and have them spray you with the hose?Maya:\n... Good idea, Nick!Phoenix:\n(Apparently, Fey blood is no aid in detecting sarcasm...) (Changed from [Apparently, E.S.P. is no aid in detecting sarcasm...] in the original release)TV:\nWe interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin! Strange occurrences continue at Gourd Lake... But this time, it's murder!Phoenix:\n(Gourd Lake again?)TV:\nThe body of a man was found in the lake early this morning. A suspect was apprehended. Sources inside the police department revealed... that the suspect's name is Miles Edgeworth, age 24. Edgeworth was an up-and-coming prosecution attorney, known for his skill and connections. He was guaranteed a long and rewarding career... Has he thrown it all away?Phoenix:\n(...? E-Edgeworth!?) What's going on!? Edgeworth would never do something like--Maya:\nNick?Phoenix:\nYipes! M-Maya!Maya:\nThe fireman yelled at me when I called him.Phoenix:\nWe've got bigger things to worry about than that! They arrested Edgeworth!Maya:\nWhat? You mean, the prosecutor?Phoenix:\nYeah, he's a suspect... in a murder!Maya:\nWhaaaaat!? When? Where? Whom? Why? How?Phoenix:\nI-I don't know!Maya:\nLet's go find out, Nick!Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBookshelf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nDifficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. I tried reading one, and it made my head hurt. When I closed it, it slipped out of my hand. Then my foot hurt too.\n\n\n\n\nCharley the plant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMia's favorite plant. Its name is \"Charley.\" Maya's gotten the knack of watering it lately. Charley's been perking up these days.\n\n\n\n\nDesk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMia's desk. If we had more clients, I would probably sit here more often. Lately, I've been spending more time on the couch, watching TV.\n\n\n\n\nMovie poster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMaya brought in a poster of the Steel Samurai the other day. We had a big fight over whether to put it up or not. I know she's just waiting for a chance to sneak it up on the wall.\n\n\n\n\nWindow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nLooks like it's cleaning day again at the hotel across the way. I hear they're planning a second branch outside the city. I can see the bellboy, getting the angle of that screwdriver in the drawer just right.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to do\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, what should we do?\nMaya:\nWhat do you mean!? Let's investigate! We should talk to Mr. Edgeworth, and check out the crime scene!\nPhoenix:\n(You're right... We need more information! Save aimlessness and confusion for later!)\n\n\n\n\nAny ideas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell? Got any good ideas?\nMaya:\nNot really. I do my best thinking when I'm standing underneath a waterfall.Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYou know, I think it's developing a nice luster.\nMaya:\nI'll look at your badge later, Nick. We've got work to do!\nPhoenix:\n(I suppose you're right...)December 25Detention CenterVisitor's RoomMaya:\nYou know, Nick... We've all been in here one time or another, haven't we?Phoenix:\nI guess it comes with the territory.Maya:\nI'm not sure it's something we should mention to too many people... Aah!Phoenix:\n... Hey! Edgeworth! Come back!Edgeworth:\nWhat are you doing here!?Maya:\nNick, I don't think he's in a very good mood.Phoenix:\nWell, he is in detention. Were you in a good mood when you were here?Edgeworth:\nSo, you've come to laugh at the fallen attorney? Then laugh, laugh! Well? Why aren't you laughing?Maya:\nNick... Should we be laughing?Phoenix:\nNah. It's a trick. Laugh and he'll get mad... or burst into tears. Edgeworth. We don't have so much free time we can spend it coming down here to laugh at you.Edgeworth:\n... Yes you do.Phoenix:\n(Actually, he's right.)Edgeworth:\n... I hoped you wouldn't come. I didn't want you to see me. Not like this.Phoenix:\n(I didn't want to see you like this, either. Believe me.) (Changed from [Hey, I didn't want to see you either, believe me.] in the original release)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurveillance camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSmile for the camera...\n\n\n\n\nSecurity guard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch since I came in. A real pro. Or maybe he's just nervous with Edgeworth in the room.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth. Tell me what happened.\nEdgeworth:\n... Why should I? What are you going to do about it?\nMaya:\nDuh! We're going to help you, that's what!\nEdgeworth:\n...! ... Help me? You? Don't be ridiculous.\nPhoenix:\nSorry...?\nEdgeworth:\nYou're a novice! You've only been in three trials!\nPhoenix:\nH-hey!\nEdgeworth:\nSure, you got lucky and won all three... But your luck's bound to run out some day! You need real skill, Wright. Experience!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nNick! He's insulting you! Nick? Why am I always the one who has to get angry!?\n\n\n\n\nGourd Lake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe murder took place at Gourd Lake, correct?\nEdgeworth:\nYes... late last night.\nPhoenix:\nThe lake is a long way away from your offices and the court... Why were you down there?\nEdgeworth:\n... I see no need to tell you.\nMaya:\nM-Mr. Edgeworth! You... you didn't really...?\nEdgeworth:\n... Gourdy.\nMaya:\nHuh?\nEdgeworth:\nI went to see Gourdy.\nMaya:\n\"Gourdy\"? What's that!?\nPhoenix:\nI'll... tell you later. (Why won't Edgeworth talk to us?)\n\n\n\n\nDid you do it (appears after \"What happened\", \"Gourd Lake\", and presenting Attorney's Badge)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth... this is really hard for me to ask... But... you didn't do it, right? Right?\nEdgeworth:\n... Think what you will. I have only one request.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEdgeworth:\nStay out of this case.\nMaya:\nWhy!? B-but Nick is trying to help you!\nEdgeworth:\nI know...! I know that! But I don't want your help, okay?\nMaya:\n\n\n\nWhy not?\nEdgeworth:\n... Look, just go away, and leave me alone!\nMaya:\nNick... Mr. Edgeworth did it, didn't he.\nPhoenix:\nMaya! Let's go investigate elsewhere.\nMaya:\nBut, Nick...Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney's Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYour attorney's badge...?\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth. Let me defend you.\nEdgeworth:\n... Hah! Hah hah! Good one, Wright. But I'm not that hard up. Not yet.\nMaya:\nWh-what do you mean by that?\nEdgeworth:\nMe? Trust a wet-behind-the-ears lawyer with only three trials under his belt? Never!\nMaya:\nWh-what!?\nEdgeworth:\nMy case is near hopeless, Wright. Every defense attorney I've talked to has turned me down.\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nEdgeworth:\nSimply put, they were afraid they'd lose. It occurred to me that it might be my fault that they lack confidence. After all, I did get every single one of their clients declared \"guilty.\"\nPhoenix:\nI don't believe it!\nEdgeworth:\nRegardless, I don't want you involved in this. You in particular I cannot ask to do this.December 25Gourd Lake ParkEntranceMaya:\nThis is where it happened?Phoenix:\nYeah. Gourd Lake is in the middle of this park.Maya:\nI can see some police walking around in there.Phoenix:\nQuestioning people, probably.Maya:\nHey! Isn't that Detective Gumshoe over there?Gumshoe:\nWell, pal!? There's enough of us here! Anyone found anything?Police:\nS-sorry, sir... Nothing.Gumshoe:\nIdiot! The trial's tomorrow! We need clues, on the double!Police:\nB-but, sir... There weren't any clues... that's why we arrested that attorney, Mr. Edgeworth! It's clear, sir. He's the one who--Gumshoe:\nShaddup! Just you try saying that again! I'll... I'll... I'll make you sorry if you do! (Changed from [I'll... er... I'll make you sorry if you do!] in the original release) So just... just, get outta my face, pal! (Changed from [I mean... just, get outta my face, pal!] in the original release)Police:\nY-yes, sir!Maya:\nDetective Gumshoe's kinda scary today!Gumshoe:\nRecruits... peh! ... Aah!Maya:\nEek!Gumshoe:\nHey, you're that Harry guy! Harry Butz!Phoenix:\nWright! Phoenix Wright! (Will he ever learn my name!?)Gumshoe:\nAnd just what are you doing here, pal? Investigating!?Phoenix:\nHuh? Um, well, yes. I suppose.Gumshoe:\nWell, I'm here to help! Ask me anything you want! Bring it!Maya:\nHe seems different than usual. I wonder what's up? Umm... Mr. Edgeworth hasn't actually asked us to defend him yet...Gumshoe:\nHuh!? Oh? Y-you don't say...Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrees\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI feel winter's chill from the bare leaf trees today... *sigh* What is it about winter that turns people into poets?\nMaya:\nI don't know, but my toes are starting to feel numb.\nPhoenix:\n(Yes... my poetry has that effect on some people.)\n\n\n\n\nSign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe sign says \"Gourd Lake Nature Park.\" This place is full of families picnicking on the weekend.\nMaya:\nBut... no waterfall.\nPhoenix:\nNot many picnickers come here for spiritual training, Maya.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe? Do you know what happened here?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? You don't know, pal?\nPhoenix:\nNo...\nGumshoe:\nWow, okay, Mr. Head-in-the-fluffy-pink-clouds Lawyer.\nPhoenix:\nHead-in-the... huh?\nGumshoe:\nNever mind, I'll tell you. It happened last night, about 15 minutes after midnight. There was a boat out on Gourd Lake. In that boat were two men. One of those men shot the other with a pistol.\nMaya:\nAnd... the shooter was Mr. Edgeworth?\nGumshoe:\nA cop who arrived on the scene arrested him.\nMaya:\nHow did they get there so fast? (Changed from [How did he get there so fast?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nWell... There was a witness. When the report came in, we raced to the lake.\nPhoenix:\nA witness?\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nYou don't think Mr. Edgeworth is a... murderer, do you!? (Changed from [You don't think Mr. Edgeworth is a... murderer!?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nAbsolutely not! It's impossible! I don't care if there's a witness either! I don't believe a lick of it!\nMaya:\nR-right! Who cares what the witness says!\nPhoenix:\n(I care!)\nMaya:\n... You really believe in him, don't you, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nCourse I do! But... the police are pretty sure he's the killer. Nobody's even really taking this investigation that seriously.\nMaya:\nOh no!\nGumshoe:\nAfter all the help Mr. Edgeworth has been to us... Hard to imagine that no one's standing up to take his side.\nMaya:\nWell, at least you are, Detective. At least you are.\n\n\n\n\nDefense request\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nDo you know who will be Mr. Edgeworth's defense attorney in tomorrow's trial?\nGumshoe:\nHe hasn't got one yet.\nMaya:\nWhat? The trial IS tomorrow, isn't it?\nGumshoe:\nWell, I don't know the whole story... But apparently no one he's been talking to will take his case.\nMaya:\nW-why not?\nGumshoe:\nMr. Edgeworth won't tell me! When you guys showed up, I figured he'd asked you to defend him.\nPhoenix:\nU-unfortunately not...\nGumshoe:\nWell, pal, then you got a job to do! Help out Mr. Edgeworth! Prove that badge you wear isn't just some fancy piece of metal! Prove it to me, pal! Show me you're an attorney!\n\n\n\n\nDefense request (after presenting Attorney's Badge in Detention Center - Visitor's Room)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nI-is it true? No one will take Mr. Edgeworth's case?\nGumshoe:\nYeah... He's a bit of a celebrity. If you defended him, and lost, your reputation'd be sure to suffer. What's more... The case against him is... well, it's pretty solid.\nPhoenix:\n(I suppose it would be if they have a witness.)\nGumshoe:\nHey! Pal! Don't tell me your going to turn your back on him too!? Remember the Steel Samurai case? (Changed from [Remember the Steel Samurai!] in the original release) Mr. Edgeworth helped you get your client declared innocent!\nPhoenix:\nI... I know. I went to Edgeworth. I tried. He really doesn't want us to represent him. Especially not us, he said.\nGumshoe:\nWhat!? W-well, that doesn't make any sense, pal! You should have heard him talking about you after that trial! (Changed from [You should have heard him talking about you after the Steel Samurai case!] in the original release) He kept saying \"Wright, Wright, Wright,\" over and over.\nMaya:\n... Nick? I'm not sure that's a good sign.\nPhoenix:\nNeither am I...\nGumshoe:\nWhy wouldn't he want your help? I don't get it.\n\n\n\n\nThe witness (appears after \"What happened\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWho was this witness?\nGumshoe:\nEr, sorry, pal. That's confidential. Anyway, the witness saw everything, apparently. I'm sure they'll turn up at the trial tomorrow.\nPhoenix:\nWas there only that one witness?\nGumshoe:\nYep. It was pretty cold out on the lake last night. And, it was Christmas Eve after all. Still, we're being thorough. You never know when you're going to turn up another witness. That's why we're here today, checking things out. So far, we're coming up empty...\nMaya:\nOh! It's Christmas today! I'd forgotten.

Why is it called \"Gourd Lake\"?\nPhoenix:\nOh. Well, a long time ago, they used to grow gourds here.\nMaya:\nWhoa! No way! I was sure it was because the lake looked like a gourd when viewed from above! You know, like an hourglass shape?\nPhoenix:\nWell, it is shaped like a gourd, actually.

Right before my eyes... He was shot and killed, and I saw it all.\nMaya:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nMy memories from that time are... foggy. I suppose it's a self-defense mechanism. In any case, a suspect was arrested... a man. It's pretty clear he was the only one who could have killed my father. The spirit medium they used to talk to my late father said the same thing. It was an attorney by the name of Robert Hammond that cleared the suspect's name.\nPhoenix:\nAnd Hammond... is the victim in the Gourd Lake murder?\nEdgeworth:\nCorrect.\nMaya:\nUmm... That spirit medium... that was my mom.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat? You mean you're...? ... It's strange.

What does that mean?\nPhoenix:\nWhen a case's statute of limitations runs out, legally, the case never happened.\nEdgeworth:\nThree days from now, DL-6 will be closed... forever.\n\n\n\n\nThe suspect (appears after \"The DL-6 Incident\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nWhat happened to the suspect? The one who got off innocent?\nEdgeworth:\nI don't know... He disappeared from public view. Nobody knows where to. If he's still alive, he'd be about 50 years old now.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I can understand why he'd go into hiding... It'd be hard to live a normal life after being a murder suspect in such a big case.)\n\n\n\n\nYour father (appears after \"The DL-6 Incident\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nUmm... so, was your father a lawyer?\nEdgeworth:\nHe was...

Once you start on something, you always see it through, don't you?\nPhoenix:\nAbout the \"DL-6 Incident\"...\nEdgeworth:\nRight... DL-6. I didn't want you to find out about it. That is why I refused your offer to defend me. I'm sorry if it sounded like I thought you weren't up to the job. I just wanted to keep you away from DL-6.\nPhoenix:\nSo... do you still think it would have been better for me to stay away?\nEdgeworth:\nI don't know. But...

How could I refuse you, Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nThank you, Wright.\nLeads to:\n\"This is my chance to finally pay you back.\"Phoenix:\nThis is my chance to finally pay you back.Maya:\nPay him back...?Edgeworth:\nPay me back? For what? I don't remember ever doing anything for you.Phoenix:\nNever mind... I guess you don't really need to know.Edgeworth:\nHuh... My letter of request. Please give it to Detective Gumshoe.Edgeworth's Request put in pocket.Phoenix:\nWell, I guess we should... ... W-what's that!?Maya:\nE-earthquake! Nick! It's a big one! Whaaaaa! I-it's calming down... ... Whew... that was scary!Phoenix:\n...? Huh? Where's Edgeworth?Maya:\n... There. He's on the floor in a ball, shivering. I guess he doesn't do so well with earthquakes.Phoenix:\n(I've heard of running, but curling up in a ball?)Maya:\nWell, I guess we're done. Mr. Edgeworth doesn't seem like he's going to stand up any time soon. Let's go, Nick.Phoenix:\nUh.. right.

Says she came \"to talk to y'all after hearing what Mr. Wright had to say\"! What's this all about, pal!?Phoenix:\n(Lotta Hart...)Gumshoe:\nWhy are you going around finding more witnesses!? You want to give Mr. Edgeworth the death sentence, pal!?Phoenix:\nN-no, not at all... Just... I mean, she did see something. There's nothing I can do about that. I can't go around covering up evidence!Gumshoe:\nEr...

I saw it too... But you really can't tell from the photo who it is shooting.\nGumshoe:\nThat's why she said she's going to enlarge the photo. She said \"it'll drop the quality a mite, but should let us see who's who!\"\nMaya:\nShe can do that!?\nPhoenix:\n(Okay, so there's going to be an enlarged photograph that shows Edgeworth in the act. Great. Just great.)\nGumshoe:\nIn any case, she's going to be the one testifying tomorrow.\nMaya:\nHuh? What happened to the other witness?\nGumshoe:\nWell... Apparently, there was a cancellation.\nPhoenix:\n(A \"cancellation\"...!?)\n\n\n\n\nTomorrow's trial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nI'm afraid tomorrow is going to be life or death for poor Mr. Edgeworth. We got a witness who says she saw the very moment of the murder. And we got a photo taken when the shot rang out.\nPhoenix:\n(I'd say that sounds like a pretty unwinnable case... But wait... What did Mia used to say? If he's innocent, there's got to be something I've overlooked...)\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nIt sound like Mr. Edgeworth is going to ask the state to assign a public defender. I was just asked to file the paperwork. But you still got time, pal! Go talk to him again, for me, please! You have to convince him! You have to make him let you defend him! Please!

Glad I waited till the last minute to file those papers! I'll rip 'em up and start new ones for you!Phoenix:\nThanks, Detective. Well, see you in court tomorrow, then.Gumshoe:\nGood luck, pal. Hey! You guys feel that earthquake a little while back? I was worried!Maya:\nWorried? We're fine! I've lived out here my whole life. I'm pretty used to them by now.Gumshoe:\nOh, I wasn't worried about you two. I was worried about Mr. Edgeworth!Phoenix:\n(Oh, right...) He did seem to over-react a little, now that you mention it.Gumshoe:\nYeah, well, I'm not surprised. It was a pretty big quake. I'm going to go check on him. You two go eat and get your rest for tomorrow's trial. Later!Maya:\n... I wonder what it is with Mr. Edgeworth and earthquakes?Phoenix:\nI wonder... He was never that scared of them when he was in school.Phoenix:\n(Then again, I only really got to know him in 4th grade.

(ellipsis and question mark highlighted in the original release)Edgeworth:\nThat's right, Manfred von Karma. He's the best prosecutor there is. He hasn't lost a case in his 40-year career. He is a god of prosecution, Wright! A god!Maya:\nNot a single case?Edgeworth:\nHe'll do anything to get a guilty verdict, anything.Phoenix:\nHmm. Sounds like someone else I know, Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\nHmph. You don't understand. I mean he'll really do anything. Manfred von Karma is a man to be feared.Phoenix:\n(That's quite a claim coming from someone who forges evidence...)Edgeworth:\nHe taught me what it really means to \"prosecute.\"Phoenix:\nWh-what!?Edgeworth:\nJust picture a prosecutor as vicious as me... multiplied by a factor of ten.Maya:\nUgh... So... so was he your teacher, then, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nSomething like that...Maya:\nAnd now he's trying to get you found guilty!? What a creep! Oh, wait... Maybe he's planning on losing on purpose to help you out.Edgeworth:\nNot a chance... He hasn't lost once in 40 years. 40 years! He's as ruthless as me, times twenty!Maya:\nThat's pretty ruthless...Edgeworth:\nLike I said. He's a god among prosecutors.Phoenix:\n(I guess that's something like Mia was to me. Speaking of Mia...) Um, Maya?Maya:\nUh huh?Phoenix:\nWe could really be using Mia's help right now... don't you think?Maya:\nOh...Phoenix:\n?Maya:\nI can't. Sorry. I tried, I really tried, but I couldn't reach.Phoenix:\nYou couldn't \"reach\"?Maya:\nI think it's because I haven't been training. My powers are weak again...Phoenix:\nOh man, what bad timing!Maya:\nI'm really sorry. I'll try my best!Phoenix:\nI hope so!Edgeworth:\nWhat are you whispering about?Phoenix:\nO-oh, it's nothing. Well, it's time. Let's head in...December 26, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Miles Edgeworth.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Karma:\n...Judge:\nErr, Mr. von Karma? Is the prosecution ready?Karma:\n... Fool... You seriously think that I would stand here were I not completely prepared?Judge:\nR-right, my apologies!Phoenix:\n(He's even got the Judge scared!)Judge:\nVery well, your opening statement, please.Karma:\n... Decisive evidence... A decisive witness... What else could possibly be required?Judge:\nAh... er, nothing of course. That should be fine. The prosecution may call its first witness.Maya:\nWhat's with this guy? Is he royalty or something?Phoenix:\nHow am I supposed to fight against this!?Karma:\nI call the detective in charge of this case, Detective Dick Gumshoe.Phoenix:\n(Okay, Gumshoe's first... Let's see how this goes.)Karma:\nDescribe the incident. Now!Gumshoe:\nY-yessir!Phoenix:\n(Detective Gumshoe looks nervous...)Gumshoe:\nEr, please take a look at the map. The murder happened late Christmas Eve, around midnight. There was one boat in the very middle of the lake. There were two men on the boat. Now, there happened to be a woman camping here on the edge of the lake. At 12:10 AM, she heard two pistol shots. Then the boat started to move. It went towards the boat rental shop.Karma:\nHmm.Overhead Map added to the Court Record.Karma:\nTestify to the court about your arrest. Now!Judge:\nW-w-wait! Mr. von Karma...Karma:\nYes?Judge:\nActually, I'm the one that's supposed to be handling these proceedings...Karma:\nWrong. There is only one thing you need to do here. You will slam down your gavel and say the word \"guilty.\" That is your role!Judge:\nY-yes, of course. You're quite right.Phoenix:\n(No, he's not!!!)Witness Testimony-- The Arrest of Edgeworth --Gumshoe:\nA man called into the station around 30 minutes after midnight.\nWe headed to the scene of the crime as fast as we could.\nThat's where we found Mr. Edgeworth.\nNow, I didn't suspect him of anything at all.\nBut... the next morning, a body was found in the lake.\nSo we had to arrest Mr. Edgeworth.Judge:\nHmm... I see. Very well...Karma:\nBegin your cross-examination, attorney. Now!Judge:\n...Cross Examination-- The Arrest of Edgeworth --Gumshoe:\nA man called into the station around 30 minutes after midnight.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou received a call from a \"man\"?\nGumshoe:\nEr... yup.\nPhoenix:\nBut you said there was a woman camping there? She was the one who heard the two gunshots, right?\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nThat woman and the \"man\" who called in the report are two different people, obviously!\nPhoenix:\nDifferent people?\nKarma:\nThere were two witnesses!\nPhoenix:\n(Urk!)\nKarma:\nTheir testimonies were quite similar however. Today I've summoned the woman who was camping.\nPhoenix:\n(The woman who was camping... Lotta Hart.)\nKarma:\nWhat happened next, Detective?Gumshoe:\nWe headed to the scene of the crime as fast as we could.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow long was it between receiving the report and your arrival at the lake?\nGumshoe:\nEr, well... I'd say it was about three minutes.\nPhoenix:\nThat's pretty fast!\nGumshoe:\nOur motto for the month is \"get there quick.\"\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nDetective! You will refrain from casually revealing department secrets!\nGumshoe:\nY-yessir! Sorry, sir!\nKarma:\nDo that, and you'll be able to look forward to your next salary review.\nGumshoe:\nSo much to look forward to, these days...\nKarma:\nThis is no time for daydreaming! Continue!\nGumshoe:\nY-yessir!Gumshoe:\nThat's where we found Mr. Edgeworth.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat was Mr. Edgeworth like when you saw him then?\nGumshoe:\nWell... From what I saw, he looked pretty relaxed. Not like a murderer at all, really.\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nDetective! The court requires the facts, NOT your opinion! How many years have you been on the force!? Facts only, Detective! Hard, cold, objective facts!\nGumshoe:\nY-y-yessir!\nPhoenix:\n(Man, he's got his share of objections...)Gumshoe:\nNow, I didn't suspect him of anything at all.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy didn't you think he was suspicious?\nGumshoe:\nYou should know! We have a deep, trusting relationship with the prosecutors.\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nDetective! The court isn't interested in your musings! \"Deep\"? \"Trusting\"? Poppycock! I've never heard so many flippant comments from an active detective on the force!\nGumshoe:\nMmph!\nPhoenix:\n(Detective Gumshoe doesn't look so good...)\nKarma:\nContinue! Now!Gumshoe:\nBut... the next morning, a body was found in the lake.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid you find any clues on the body?\nGumshoe:\nA single bullet was recovered from the body. He was shot through the heart... fatally.\nKarma:\nJudge! Here's the bullet... It didn't strike bone, so its shape is well preserved.\nJudge:\nVery well. The court accepts this bullet into evidence.\nPistol Bullet added to the Court Record.Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid you find any clues on the body?\nGumshoe:\nA single bullet was recovered from the body.

That is a vital piece of information. Please revise your testimony.\nGumshoe:\nRight! S-sorry, Your Honor.\nChanges statement from \"So we had to arrest Mr. Edgeworth.\" to \"The murder weapon we found in the boat was decisive evidence.\"Gumshoe:\nThe murder weapon we found in the boat was decisive evidence.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat about the pistol made it \"decisive evidence\"?\nKarma:\nTsk tsk tsk...\nPhoenix:\n(Ack! He has the same evil laugh as Edgeworth...)\nGumshoe:\nThere were fingerprints on the pistol found in the boat. They were clear prints from Mr. Edgeworth's right hand.\nPhoenix:\nWh-what!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! So Mr. Edgeworth's fingerprints were found on the murder weapon!?\nGumshoe:\nY-yes, Your Honor.\nKarma:\nJudge! This is the weapon in question.\nJudge:\nA-accepted into evidence.\nPistol added to the Court Record.Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat about the pistol made it \"decisive evidence\"?\nKarma:\nTsk tsk tsk...\nPhoenix:\n(Ack!

They were clear prints from Mr. Edgeworth's right hand.\nPhoenix:\nWh-what!?Maya:\nNick. Doesn't it seem like Detective Gumshoe is being a little vague?Phoenix:\nI bet von Karma is feeding him lines! His testimony's probably filled with landmines just waiting for me to press.Maya:\nWhat do we do?Phoenix:\nGrit our teeth and press, I guess. What else can we do?Maya:\nWell said, Nick! You're the man!After pressing fifth statement and pressing modified sixth statement:Karma:\nMembers of the court... We now have the pistol used in the murder, and the bullet found in the body! Detective!Gumshoe:\nY-y-yessir!Karma:\nWas the bullet found in the body fired from this pistol?Gumshoe:\nYes. The ballistic markings on the bullet match the pistol.Judge:\nHmm...Maya:\nHey, Nick! What does he mean, \"ballistic markings\"?Karma:\nShocking! To imagine someone here does not know something as basic as ballistic markings!Maya:\nN-Nick! He's glaring at me!Karma:\nTsk... very well, I'll explain. Actually, Judge! You do it.Judge:\nEh? M-me? ... Erm, ahem. Ballistic markings are like the \"fingerprints\" of a gun. The barrel leaves distinctive marks on each bullet it fires. You can examine these \"ballistic fingerprints\" to see which gun fired the shot. It's quite accurate.Karma:\nIndeed. This leads to one, inevitable conclusion: the bullet found in the victim's heart... was, without a doubt, fired from this pistol. This pistol which, as you may recall, was covered with the defendant's own fingerprints!Judge:\nO-order! Order!Phoenix:\n(This is bad... This makes it look like Edgeworth did it!)Karma:\nWell, Judge?Judge:\nI'd say it's almost decisive, yes. Honestly, I could declare a verdict at this point. However...Karma:\nYou wish to hear the witness speak, no doubt. Very well. I am somewhat fatigued, and so I will take a brief break. I will call my witness after the recess. Which will last ten minutes. Judge!Judge:\nY-yes?Karma:\nWhat are you doing? A ten minute recess! Now!Judge:\nB-but, wait, I...Karma:\nJust bang your flimsy gavel and get on with it, man!Judge:\nY-yes! Ahem. This court will take a ten minute recess.Phoenix:\n(Who's running this court, anyway!?)December 26, 11:09 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2Phoenix:\nEdgeworth! What's going on here!? Your fingerprints were on the murder weapon!Edgeworth:\nUh... hmm...Phoenix:\nAnd that foggy photo makes one thing clear... The only one who could have shot that man was the person in the photo!Edgeworth:\nTrue...Phoenix:\nWas that you in the boat?Edgeworth:\n... Yes. It was me.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Edgeworth:\nBut... you must believe me. I didn't shoot him.Phoenix:\nTh-then who did!?Edgeworth:\nI... don't know.Phoenix:\nYou don't know!? Weren't you right there!?Edgeworth:\n... I heard a gunshot from very close by. Then... the other man fell from the boat. I can't say why, but... I thought, at the time, that he had shot himself!Phoenix:\nY-you mean it was a suicide!?Edgeworth:\n... That's the only explanation I can come up with.Phoenix:\nHuh... (How am I going to convince anyone of that!?) Say, Maya?Maya:\nHuh? Wh-what?Phoenix:\nAny progress with Mia?Maya:\nOh... Sorry. It's no good.Phoenix:\nUgh...Maya:\nI know... I'm no good for anything, am I, Nick? If I can't call my sister, I might as well not be here, right?No, I need you here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nNo, of course not, I need you here! I can see you're always trying to help out. Even if you don't actually help... it's the thought that counts, right?\nMaya:\nIt's okay Nick, you don't have to make me feel better.\nLeads to:\n\"I don't know anything about trials, or defense...\"Yeah, you're useless\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm, well, actually... (You don't know law, you don't have any trial experience or techniques... Yeah, you're pretty much useless... but I can't say that!)\nMaya:\nIt's okay Nick. You don't have to say anything. Your face said it for you.\nPhoenix:\n(Whoops!) N-no, o-of course we... I'm sorry.\nMaya:\nIt's okay Nick.\nLeads to:\n\"I don't know anything about trials, or defense...\"Maya:\nI don't know anything about trials, or defense...

But you never know when my luck is going to run out!Maya:\nReally...?Edgeworth:\nW-w-whoa! Wright! Don't jinx this case any worse than it already is! It's bad for my heart...Phoenix:\nOh? Oh! S-sorry... (Whoops!)Judge:\nCourt is back in session. Mr. von Karma, call your witness.Karma:\nYes. Will Ms. Lotta Hart take the stand?Karma:\nLotta Hart, you are a research student at a university?Lotta:\nThat I am.Karma:\nGood. Begin by telling us what you saw the night of the incident. And don't add anything trivial or subjective. Understand?Lotta:\n... Y'all need to learn some manners.Karma:\nUNDERSTAND?Lotta:\nY-yeah, I understand, I understand!Judge:\nEr... very well. Your testimony, please.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Lotta:\nIt was Christmas Eve, just after midnight, I reckon.\nI was in my car.\nI heard this \"bang\" come up from the lake.\nWhen I looked out the window, I saw two gents in a boat.\nThen there was another \"bang\"...\nThere wasn't nary a thing on the lake but that boat.Karma:\nEnough.Lotta:\nHuh?Karma:\nJudge! She happened to take a photo of the incident! This is that photo. Accept it as evidence.Judge:\nW-well! This is a surprise! This looks like... the very moment of the murder! O-Order! I will remove you from the court if I do not have order immediately!Karma:\nAs the witness testified, she looked at the lake when she heard the shot. There were no other boats on that lake! So, the man in the boat with the victim must have been the one who shot him... Yes. It was the defendant, Miles Edgeworth!!!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order...! I will have order!Karma:\n... Well, Judge?Judge:\nThe evidence is... decisive. I have very little doubt about this case. Very well, this court finds the defendant...Phoenix:Phoenix:\nW-wait! Your Honor! I haven't cross-examined the witness yet!Karma:\nA cross-examination? We have photographic proof! What question can there possibly be!? This photo is worth a thousand words... and they all read \"guilty\"! You lose. Or... Do you claim to have found a contradiction in her testimony!?Phoenix:\n...!Karma:\nVery well. If you have to, you may cross-examine the witness. You will only flounder and ask meaningless questions! You will fail to find anything! And then, I will have you held in contempt of court!Maya:\nUh, Nick... contempt...?Phoenix:\n\"Contempt of court,\" you know?Maya:\nI... guess I understand. Well... what are you going to do? Do you really think there was a contradiction with the facts in her testimony?I think there was\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI... think I noticed one little thing...\nMaya:\nWow, I'm impressed, Nick! I didn't notice anything! Right! Let's take him on!\nPhoenix:\nY-yeah... (I got a bad feeling about this...)\nLeads to:\n\"I understand... I will cross-examine the witness!\"I think there wasn't\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHonestly, I found nothing.\nMaya:\nI dunno, I thought her testimony was strange. She was so vague about everything!\nPhoenix:\nI bet von Karma probably fed her her lines.\nMaya:\nBut... But if you don't cross-examine her, the judge will...\nPhoenix:\nHe'll bang down that \"flimsy gavel\" of his and declare Edgeworth guilty.\nMaya:\nI guess we'll just have to bluff it.\nPhoenix:\nBut if we mess up... contempt of court.\nMaya:\nHey, if we lose we'll be held in public contempt!\nPhoenix:\nEr... right.\nLeads to:\n\"I understand... I will cross-examine the witness!\"Phoenix:\nI understand... I will cross-examine the witness!Karma:\nTsk tsk tsk... Very well!Judge:\nI pray for your sake this isn't a waste of time.Cross Examination-- Witness's Account --Lotta:\nIt was Christmas Eve, just after midnight, I reckon.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Just after midnight,\" you say? In other words, it was no longer Christmas Eve... but Christmas Day!\nLotta:\nHuh? Uh, yeah, well, yes.\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nI know you want to find contradictions, but really!\nPhoenix:\nMmmph.\nJudge:\nI hope your next contradiction is a little more relevant to the trial.Lotta:\nI was in my car.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy were you camping there, anyway?\nLotta:\nI'm a research student at my university.

Could you be more specific about your \"research\"?\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nWhat does the witness's motive in camping by the lake have to do with this case!? The answer \"is nothing\"! I object to this line of questioning!

I was asking if YOU saw the two men!\nLotta:\nUh, yeah, well, of course...\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nThe witness has testified that she saw them! There's also a photo!

What am I supposed to do now?)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nHold back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Lotta seems pretty sure of herself. I'd better not forge blindly ahead here. Still... this whole thing stinks.)\nLeads back to cross-examinationPhoenix:\n(Th-there weren't any contradictions in there!)Maya:\nSorry, Nick. If only my sister were here...Phoenix:\n(Maya's really taking this hard.)After selecting \"Press further\" upon pressing second, fourth, and sixth statements, and pressing fifth statement:Judge:\nEnough! I think we've heard all we need to hear, Mr. Wright. It seems you are unable to find a contradiction in the testimony worth noting.Phoenix:\nB-but, Your Honor!Karma:\nYou keep your promise!Judge:\nMr. Wright. I am afraid that I will have to penalize any further outbursts... By holding you in contempt of court!Karma:\nAnd if that happens, you'll have to leave the courtroom immediately! Understood...?Phoenix:\nUh... uh huh.Maya:\nNick...! Lotta's testimony is fishy, Nick! Real fishy!Phoenix:\nI... know what you mean. But... If I can't say anything, what can I do?Judge:\nI believe we've covered the evidence sufficiently to make a decision.Karma:\nThen, pass your judgment!Judge:\nVery well. Mr. Miles Edgeworth, please take the stand.???:Judge:\nWh-who was that!?Maya:\nIt... was me.Phoenix:\n(Maya!)Judge:\nI-is something wrong? D-do you need to use the facilities?Maya:\nNo, I do not! Lotta Hart! Your testimony stinks! It's unclear whether you were actually looking at the lake! It's highly doubtful that you actually say Mr. Edgeworth! Tell us the truth! This is a matter of life or death!Lotta:\n...!Maya:\nLotta! Did you really clearly see Mr. Edgeworth that night!? Did you see him fire that pistol!?Judge:\nYou will stand down! The court does not acknowledge the defense's outburst!Maya:\nAnswer me, Lotta!Lotta:\nWhat's the big idea, treating me like some kind of criminal!? I saw him! I swear it! I saw Edgeworth...Karma:Karma:\nEnough! Judge... Declare the defense in contempt of court!Judge:\nY-yes... yes, of course. I'm sorry, but you WERE warned. Guard! Escort Mr. Wright out of the courtroom! He is in contempt of court, and must leave.Phoenix:\n(No... No...!)Wait!Maya:\nI-I was the one who made the outburst, Your Honor! Nick is innocent!Karma:\nHah! What's the difference? All that remains is for the guilty verdict to be declared! Isn't that right, Mr. Phoenix Wright!?Wrong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWrong!\nKarma:\nWhat!?\nLeads to:\n\"Did you hear what Ms. Hart just said?\"Right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Dammit, he's right...)\nMaya:\nN-Nick! There must be something we can do!\nPhoenix:\nI... don't think there is. The cross-examination is over already!\nMaya:\nB-but... but didn't Lotta just say she saw him? She did, Nick! She just said that she saw Mr. Edgeworth! She didn't say that in her testimony, did she?\nPhoenix:\n...! Y-you're right! Your Honor!\nLeads to:\n\"Did you hear what Ms. Hart just said?\"Phoenix:\nDid you hear what Ms. Hart just said? She said she clearly saw Mr. Edgeworth! That was not in the testimony! That changes her testimony, and I have a right to cross-examine her again!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! Order! Order! Order!Karma:\nYou're in contempt of court! It's too late for wild claims! Judge! Sustain my objection!Judge:\n... ... I'm sorry, Mr. von Karma, but I cannot.Karma:\nWhat!?Judge:\nMs. Lotta Hart has made a new testimony. The defense does have a right to cross-examine her again.Karma:\nB-but he is in contempt of court!Maya:\nNo, I am! If you're going to arrest someone, arrest me!Judge:\nHmm... Very well. Maya Fey! You will leave the courtroom immediately.Maya:\nNick! I did what I could... You have to do the rest! Good luck!Phoenix:\nM-Maya...!Karma:\nPeh! I care not for this melodrama! Listen well, Mr. Wright! I do not tolerate badgering of my witnesses!Phoenix:\n(I'm running out of time... I'd better find a contradiction in here or else...)Judge:\nMr. Wright! Begin your cross-examination!Cross Examination-- That Last Statement --Lotta:\nI saw it clear as day. The man on the boat was Mr. Edgeworth!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, what about the other man?\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nYou cannot expect to be allowed to blithely ignore your promise, Mr. Wright! I believe you claimed there was a contradiction in the witness's testimony! Well, find it! If you can!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, I have to assign you a penalty.\nPhoenix:\n(Damn...!)Present Lake Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Got you.\"Phoenix:\n(That's it...? Uh oh. I don't know if I can find anything in that... What will Maya say...?)Phoenix:\nGot you. Got you, Ms. Hart! Finally!Lotta:\nWh-what!? You got what?Phoenix:\nLook at this photograph.Lotta:\nThe photo I took...?Phoenix:\nThe very same. There's something I want you to see in this photo... it's quite clearly visible. The fog, Ms. Hart.Lotta:\nSo... so?Phoenix:\nThis picture was taken with professional, high quality film, correct? Yet even it could not capture the faces of the men on the boat! Yet you claim you saw Mr. Edgeworth! How!?Lotta:\nWhut!? Wha--!Judge:\nMr. Wright has a point!Karma:Karma:\nThat's why I told her not to say that in her testimony! Please!Phoenix:\nYet, now she has said it, Mr. von Karma. How could you possibly see Mr. Edgeworth!? Explain yourself!Judge:\nMs. Hart.Lotta:\nWhat!Judge:\nCould you see the defendant that night?Lotta:\nO-of course! I said I could and I meant I could!Judge:\nThen, please testify as to the circumstances of your sighting.Phoenix:\n(I did it! I finally found a hole in von Karma's carefully vague testimony!)Witness Testimony-- How Edgeworth Was Seen --Lotta:\nYer right. It was a cold night, and the fog was thick as grits.\nSo, once I was finished setting up my camera, I got back in the car.\nStill, I brought my binoculars with me.\nWhen I heard that noise out on the lake, I looked with my binoculars.\nSee? No problem!Judge:\nHmm...You used binoculars? Very well. You may begin your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\n(This one'd better be good!)Cross Examination-- How Edgeworth Was Seen --Lotta:\nYer right. It was a cold night, and the mist was thick as grits.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo? How could you see Edgeworth!?\nLotta:\nNow, just hold your horses for a second! You hasty Yankee types'd never find a gal where I'm from.\nJudge:\nDefense attorneys have trouble with that as it is.\nPhoenix:\n(Nobody loves me...)Lotta:\nSo, once I was finished setting up my camera, I got back in the car.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYour \"camera\"...?\nLotta:\nYeah. It's got an automatic...\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nThe issue we are concerned with here is Ms. Hart seeing Mr. Edgeworth! The camera has nothing to do with this at all!\nJudge:\nObjection sustained.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh! He's not letting her answer any of my questions!)Lotta:\nStill, I brought my binoculars with me.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Binoculars\"?\nLotta:\nYeah, binoculars.\nPhoenix:\nYesterday, you mentioned that you were out looking for shooting stars, correct?\nLotta:\nWell... yeah.\nPhoenix:\nWouldn't you need a telescope, not binoculars, for that?\nLotta:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nI've got doubts about your camera, too! Was that really to take pictures of meteor showers?\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nThe camera is irrelevant to this case!\nPhoenix:\nYou can't say that for certain!\nJudge:\nHmm... Mr. Wright. Is the camera really relevant to this case? If you believe it is, you may continue with this line of questioning.\nKarma:\nBut know this! If you find nothing with this, there will be consequences!\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Do you wish to press further about the camera?\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(This is make-it-or-break-it time!) The camera is of utmost importance, Your Honor. It is, perhaps, the key to this entire case! Therefore, I will continue my line of questioning! (Wow! Maybe I went a little overboard there...)\nJudge:\nVery well! Ms. Hart! You will testify to the court about the camera!\nLotta:\nYeah, yeah, I hear ya.\nChanges statement from \"Still, I brought my binoculars with me.\" to \"The camera was set up to take pictures of a meteor shower.\"\n\n\n\n\nHold back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOkay, Your Honor... I withdraw my question. (I have to remember who I'm dealing with! I bet von Karma wants to trap me so he can put me in contempt! I think I'll hang back for now and see what happens.)\nKarma:\nHah!\nLeads back to cross-examinationLotta:\nThe camera was set up to take pictures of a meteor shower.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nMs. Hart. What made you choose that lake to photograph meteors? You know the fog gets thick on that lake. It's not very suited to stargazing.\nLotta:\nYeah, well... Y'see, I... I guess I wasn't thinking too straight! Har!\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nMr. Wright! I will not have you badgering my witness because of her challenged intellect!\nLotta:\nNow wait a minute!\nKarma:\nContinue your testimony. You were saying how it was that you saw Edgeworth?\nLotta:\nGrr...\nKarma:\nNo unnecessary comments, please.Present Lotta's Camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou were photographing shooting stars? That's a lie!\nLotta:\nS-says who!?\nPhoenix:\nI saw the camera you set up yesterday. It was pointed directly at the lake! You have to point a camera upwards to take photos of the stars, Ms. Hart!\nLeads to:\n\"Ooof!\"Present Lake Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou were photographing shooting stars? That's a lie!\nLotta:\nS-says who!?\nPhoenix:\nTake a look at this photograph. This was taken on an automatic setting, was it not?\nLotta:\nY-yeah, that's right.\nPhoenix:\nYou have to point a camera upwards to take photos of the stars, Ms. Hart! But, as this photograph clearly shows... The camera was pointed directly at the lake!\nLeads to:\n\"Ooof!\"Lotta:\nWhen I heard that noise out on the lake, I looked with my binoculars.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nIf there was a heavy fog, how would binoculars change that at all?\nLotta:\nWhat do you mean?\nPhoenix:\nEven binoculars can't see through fog! But... you say you clearly saw him?\nLotta:\nEr... I did... yeah.\nKarma:\nEnough! There is no room for doubt in her testimony!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm. She sounded pretty doubtful to me! But... I have to find a clear contradiction first.)Phoenix:\n(I don't care how many von Karmic objections I get... I'm going to find a hole in this testimony if it's the last thing I do!)Lotta:\nOoof!Judge:\nMr. Wright! What are you driving at?Phoenix:\nThe witness was not at the lake to photograph shooting stars, Your Honor!Lotta:\n...!Judge:\nW-well then, what exactly was she photographing?Show evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor! Take a look at this...\"I don't know\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell... that I don't know.\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nWhat the witness takes photos of is entirely her business!

Enough playing around! Here's the real evidence!\nJudge:\n\"Enough playing around\" is my line, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nUh...\nLeads back to:\n\"What was Ms. Hart trying to photograph at the lake?\"Phoenix:\nMs. Hart. This is what you were trying to photograph!Judge:\nWhat's this? A newspaper article? \"Gourdy\"...? Ah, the sighting at Gourd Lake...Phoenix:\nWell, Ms. Hart?Lotta:\nI... I never heard of no lake monster! You got proof or something? Let's see you prove that I was down at the lake trying to photograph this \"Gourdy.\"I don't have proof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, I don't have proof...\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nBah! Your ineptitude is entertaining, Mr. Wright, but enough is enough! I've had enough of baseless claims made without a hair of evidence to support them!\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWell all right, if that's how you want to play... I'll show you evidence!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Are you sure about this?\nPhoenix:\n(I'm sure sick of that smarmy prosecutor putting me down!

Here is proof that the witness was trying to photograph Gourdy, the lake monster!Present Lotta's Camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe proof, Ms. Hart, is your own camera!\nLotta:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nYou camera was set to take photos in response to loud noises, correct? Thus this photograph here, taken when a gun fired on the lake.\nLotta:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAnd here, this article about \"Gourdy.\" According to this article... Gourdy made a loud noise when it emerged! Well? You were trying to photograph Gourdy, weren't you! That's why you had set your camera to respond to loud noises!\nLeads to:\n\"Order! Order!\"Present Gourdy Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe proof is this article about Gourdy the lake monster!\nLotta:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nAccording to this article... When Gourdy breaks through the water, it makes a loud noise! Which is why you set up your camera with that microphone! You had it set to respond to loud noises! And that's how you got this picture when the pistol fired!\nLeads to:\n\"Order! Order!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHere's my proof! It's simple!\nJudge:\n...

How can they so casually toss aside this eviden... Oh. Whoops. Wrong evidence.)\nJudge:\nLuckily for you, I'm in a patient mood, Mr. Wright. One more time please.\nLeads back to:\n\"Here is proof that the witness was trying to photograph Gourdy, the lake monster!\"Judge:\nOrder! Order! I see... I, too, thought it was a little strange.Phoenix:\n(Yeah, sure!) Well, Ms. Hart? You were camping there to try and take a photo of Gourdy, weren't you?Lotta:\n... Yeah. Not bad. Are all you lawyers that smart? So, smart boy, I was down there trying to photograph Gourdy, you got me. So what?Phoenix:\nHuh...?Lotta:\nThat don't change what I saw, does it?Karma:\nExactly! What you just used several precious minutes of our time to prove... is nothing more than that the witness is an idiot who thinks monsters exist!Lotta:\nH-hey!Karma:\nBut, as she so succinctly said, so what!? It changes nothing!Phoenix:\n(Not true! You were hiding the whole thing about Gourdy for some reason, I know it! But what could it have been...? Whatever it is, I'm getting to the bottom of this!)Judge:\nMs. Hart. Why did you hide the fact that you were searching for Gourdy from the court? Please revise your testimony.Lotta:\n... Right. Fine, I'll testify. It won't change nothing, though.Phoenix:\n(Something will change... it has to! And I'm going to spot it!)Karma:\n...Witness Testimony-- Lotta's New Testimony --Lotta:\nActually, I'm not a research student at a university.\nI'm an investigative photographer.\nImagine what a scoop it'd be if I got a picture of that monster!\nThat's why I was camping out by the lake.\nBut, that's all I was hiding.\nWhen I heard the \"bang\" I looked right straight out at that lake.\nThere wasn't much else to look at, so I just watched that boat the whole time.\nThen I saw a flash, near one of the men's hands, and I heard another gunshot.\nI was looking right at that boat, the whole time, cross my heart and hope to fry.Judge:\nHmm... Well, Mr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.Karma:Karma:\nThe witness's testimony is unchanged from before! Whether she is a research student or a photographer has no bearing on this case! There is no need to waste more of our time with another pointless cross-examination!Judge:\nEr... hmm.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nI claim the defense's right to cross-examine the witness, Your Honor! (von Karma's up to something, I know it! He doesn't want me to cross-examine her because... why? Was there a contradiction?)Judge:\nVery well. You may begin the cross-examination. You seem sure of yourself, you must have something in mind.Karma:\nHah! That would be a first!Phoenix:\n(Hah hah, very funny.)Judge:\nYou understand that this is your last chance at a cross-examination, Mr. Wright? If there is no problem with the testimony this time, we will let the witness leave. I will announce my verdict at that time, Mr. Wright. Understood?Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.Cross Examination-- Lotta's New Testimony --Lotta:\nActually, I'm not a research student at a university.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThen what manner of person are you!?\nLotta:\nI'm not sure I'm high-falutin' enough to be called a \"manner\" of anything.Lotta:\nI'm an investigative photographer.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAn \"investigative photographer\"?\nLotta:\nYep. You get your photo, and sell it to the press. It's that kind of business. Hey, I was taking pictures at my sister's graduation last year... N' guess what!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... what?\nLotta:\nThere was a yoofoh just a' hanging in the sky!\nPhoenix:\nA \"yoofoh\"...?\nLotta:\nYou know, an \"Unidentified Flying Object\"? A yoofoh! That's when I had sort of a revelation. I knew I should become an investigative photographer!\nPhoenix:\nI... I see. (Kind of a shaky basis for a career...)Lotta:\nImagine what a scoop it'd be if I got a picture of that monster!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nIs \"Gourdy\" really all that newsworthy?\nLotta:\nHeck yeah! They even had him up on the TV!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not sure that appearing on the local news \"rumor of the month\" show qualifies. Last month's show was \"Bigfoot Sighted on Acorn Hill,\" I believe.)\nLotta:\nHey! They also had a picture of him in the newspaper! For real!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. This is one fight I do not believe you can win. Let's keep moving, shall we?\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.Lotta:\nThat's why I was camping out by the lake.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThat's why you put the automatic senior on your camera?\nLotta:\nYep. Borrowed it from a friend at a university. It analyzes every sound it picks up, and when it gets a \"bang!\"...\nPhoenix:\nIt snaps a shot.\nLotta:\nYep.\nPhoenix:\nSo, how many pictures has it taken so far?\nLotta:\nThe only time the camera triggered was that night.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm...)Lotta:\nBut, that's all I was hiding.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nI think it's time you told us why you felt you had to hide your true purpose at the lake.\nLotta:\nHeck, if word got out what I was up to, the lake'd be swarmin' with competitors!\nPhoenix:\nCompetitors...?\nLotta:\nYeah! Second-rate shutterbugs trying to steal my scoop!\nPhoenix:\nAh... Is that the only reason you were hiding the truth?\nLotta:\nW-well, actually...\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nMr. Wright! I'll not have you asking questions with no relevance to this case!!!\nPhoenix:\n(Whatever you say, von Karma. I know you told her to keep quiet.)Lotta:\nWhen I heard the \"bang\" I looked right straight out at that lake.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nExactly what sort of sound was it?\nLotta:\nWell, I never heard one before so I can't say for sure... but it sounded like a gunshot.

Right away!\nLeads back to:\n\"I'll show you the evidence that left hand contradicts!\"Phoenix:\nThe evidence is clear. The man in this photograph is holding that pistol in his left hand. However! The prints on the murder weapon were from Edgeworth's \"right hand\"! Ergo! The man shooting the pistol in this photograph... Is not Mr. Edgeworth!!!Judge:\nNow that everyone in the courtroom has quieted down... I would like to reconvene this court of law! Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.Judge:\nYou have given us definitive proof today. We now know that it was not Mr. Edgeworth who fired the pistol that night. However... This leaves us with a rather large problem. If Mr. Edgeworth didn't do it, then who shot our victim?Karma:\nPrecisely! As we have seen, there were no other people on the lake that night! Who but the defendant could have shot the victim!?Ms. Hart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWho else but the witness, Ms. Lotta Hart!\nJudge:\nWh-what!? Do you have proof of this!?\nPhoenix:\n(Proof-shmoof!

Your answer!\nLeads back to:\n\"Who but the defendant could have shot the victim!?\"Phoenix:\nThere is only one explanation remaining! The man who shot the victim was none other than... the victim himself!!!Judge:\nOrder! Order! So... you are saying that the victim committed suicide?Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. I can think of no other explanation.Judge:\nHmm... Indeed, that does seem to be the only remaining option.Karma:Karma:\nI'm so very, very sorry, Mr. Wright. But suicide is out of the question.Phoenix:\nWh-what!?Karma:\nAn examination of the victim's wound reveals the distance at which he was shot.Phoenix:\nThe... distance?Karma:\nThe victim was clearly shot from further than a meter away!Phoenix:\nA meter!

I had already considered the possibility of suicide, you see.Autopsy Report updated in the Court Record.Judge:\nHmm... I see. Very well, allow me to state my opinion. Considering the situation, the shooter had to be the defendant, Mr. Edgeworth. However! The prints on the gun reveal that the shooter was not Mr. Edgeworth. This is a conundrum. Therefore, I would like to suspend proceedings for this trial for the day. The court orders the defense and the prosecution to further investigate this matter.

Don't you have anything to say!?Edgeworth:\nNo. I have yet to be declared innocent, Wright.Phoenix:\nWell, yeah, but... What happened out there on that lake, anyway!? If he didn't commit suicide, then who...? The shooter was about a meter away, too!Edgeworth:\n... W-what? Don't give me that look! I did not kill him!Phoenix:\nI was just kidding around.Edgeworth:\nHmph.Phoenix:\nLook... I'm going to go check on Maya.Edgeworth:\nOh... Wright.Phoenix:\nWhat?Edgeworth:\nTell her something for me.Phoenix:\nWhat?Edgeworth:\n... ... ... Tell... Tell her to watch what she says in court. That's all.Phoenix:\n(Would it kill you to just state how you really feel with a \"thanks\", Edgeworth?) (Changed from [Yeah, I'm sure she'll be happy to hear you say that, Edgeworth. Jerk!] in the original release)Phoenix:\nI requisitioned a transcript of Lotta's entire testimony. I thought it might give me some ammunition for the trial tomorrow.

I wanted to ask you something about Edgeworth.\nGumshoe:\nWhat's up?\nPhoenix:\nIs he afraid of earthquakes? I never heard anything about that before.\nGumshoe:\n... Mr. Edgeworth doesn't talk about himself too much, see. But there's one thing that's clear as day... Him hating crime the way he does... And him becoming a lawyer... And him being scared of earthquakes... It all started with that incident.\nPhoenix:\nThe DL-6 Incident?\nGumshoe:\nYep, that's the one. Fifteen years ago... when he saw his father shot before his very eyes! He still feels the pain now, you can see it in his eyes.\n\n\n\n\nMaya Fey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI wanted to talk to you about Maya Fey...\nGumshoe:\nHuh? She's not out on bail yet? That's strange. I told 'em to let her go as soon as they had their report written up. Man... I don't know what would have happened in that courtroom today if it weren't for her. Seeing her getting dragged out by the bailiff... I'll be honest with you, pal. I shed a tear or two. Mr. Edgeworth, he was so moved I saw his lip trembling. (Changed from [Edgeworth, he was so moved I saw his lip trembling.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nReally!?

You can be proud of yourself when you get Mr. Edgeworth declared innocent, pal!\n\n\n\n\nLotta's Camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThat woman really took us for a ride, didn't she? Claiming she was a witness to a murder and all...\nPhoenix:\nStill, if it weren't for her photograph, Mr. Edgeworth wouldn't have made it today.\nGumshoe:\nOh, huh, really?\nPhoenix:\n(Umm... you were at the trial, weren't you, Detective?)\n\n\n\n\nRobert's Autopsy Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nRobert Hammond... He was the defense attorney in the DL-6 Incident trial. He's the one who got the sole suspect off the hook. I wonder what Mr. Edgeworth thinks of him. Not much, I'd wager.\n\n\n\n\nLake Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nI don't care who you are, no one can tell me that that's Mr. Edgeworth! I mean, come on, it doesn't look like him at all!\nPhoenix:\nBut Edgeworth has admitted he was on the boat.\nGumshoe:\nThen he's the one being shot, then!\nPhoenix:\nHe seemed fine in court today...\nGumshoe:\n... Details, pal, details! Whose side are you on, anyway?\nPhoenix:\n(All I'm saying is we have to respect the evidence...)\n\n\n\n\nPistol Bullet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nYep, it was fired from the murder weapon, without a doubt.\nPhoenix:\nFrom a meter away... so it would have to have been from someone else on the boat.\nGumshoe:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you make of this, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nHey, making something of things is your job!\nPhoenix:\nEr... right. (Since when do lawyers have to do detectives' work for them!?)\n\n\n\n\nPistol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nMaybe you should tell me why Mr. Edgeworth's prints were on the weapon, pal.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? How should I know!?\n\n\n\n\nLotta's Deposition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nNow, she heard two gunshots, right?\nPhoenix:\nBut wait... Look at the Court Record! According to this, the murder weapon was fired three times!\nGumshoe:\nWhat!? How's that possible!?\nPhoenix:\nWhere was the third shot fired?\nGumshoe:\nI wonder... Maybe it was a practice shot or something?\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nSorry to disappoint you, pal. I'm drawing a blank.After clearing all Talk options:Gumshoe:\nI'm going to head back to the station. I'll get the report on Maya and get her out of there as soon as I can.Phoenix:\nThank you. Oh, wait! Umm... I was wondering, how much is bail going to be?Gumshoe:\nDon't worry about that. Mr. Edgeworth is posting the whole amount.Phoenix:\nWhat? Edgeworth...?Gumshoe:\nDidn't I tell you? He's grateful to her for what she did. Alright, pal. Well don't forget to go pick her up, okay?Phoenix:\n(Hmm...

Thanks for bail.Phoenix:\nThank Edgeworth.Maya:\nHuh?Phoenix:\nHe posted bail for you. Said he was grateful for what you did.Maya:\nMr. Edgeworth did that...? ... I have to make it up to him!

We could go to the park and look for Gourdy.\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nI-I was kidding!\nPhoenix:\nStill, if there are any clues out there, the park's as good a bet as any. What do you say? Shall we head down there?\nMaya:\nSure!\n\n\n\n\nAny ideas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHave you noticed anything lately?\nMaya:\nHmm... You know, I did notice one thing while I was here in detention. It's really pretty comfortable here. It's warm, and they keep it very clean.\nPhoenix:\nI meant have you noticed anything about the case...?\nMaya:\nWell... Not much more than that, no.\nPhoenix:\n(She's probably still upset about Mia. I should leave her alone.)Wright & Co. Law OfficesMaya:\nAhh! Fresh air! I gotta say, freedom feels great.Phoenix:\nBehave yourself in the courtroom tomorrow, okay?Maya:\nHeh heh heh. Misbehaving's much more fun.Phoenix:\nIt's not going to be so much fun when Edgeworth refuses to pay your bail again.Maya:\n... Right.

It's just like the string of flags around your Steel Samurai there.\nButz:\n...! M-must be a coincidence! There's strings of flags everywhere these days! L-like elementary schools! A-and used car dealerships! L-look, why would I need a tank anyway!?\n\n\n\nTo inflate something\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYou used this to inflate that, didn't you?\nButz:\nI-inflate what!?\nPhoenix:\nWhat else?

See, the compressor I always use was on the fritz. So I tried using the tank to inflate it, just once. And, er, it didn't go so well.\nPhoenix:\n(As I suspected!)\n\n\n\nPut the tank away\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I've gotten to the bottom of that mystery!)\nButz:\nHeh.

Look, it's embarrassing so I really don't want to talk about it...\nMaya:\nTell us! Tell us!\nButz:\n... Fine. Whatever. It's like what I said, the compressor was busted. So I took the tank and tried to fill the Samurai up with that. And then...\n\n\nBLAAAAM!\n\nButz:\nThe valve busted open and made this incredible noise! And that tank there took off like a rocket. And it took my poor deflated Steel Samurai with it!\nMaya:\nWhat!? Off into Gourd Lake?\nButz:\nIt sure scared me out of my gourd, that's for sure.\nAdds Talk option \"The flying air tank\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTo go diving\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYou used this to go diving in the lake, didn't you?\nButz:\nWh-wh-what!? Why the heck would I go diving in the lake!? Wait! You... you're not... You're not saying I had something to do with that murder!?\nPhoenix:\nN-no, not at all, just...\nButz:\nHey, you watch it buddy! I'm not saying anything until my lawyer gets here!\nMaya:\nLarry...

As for who he is... We have absolutely no idea.\nMaya:\nHmm... sounds suspicious!\nGumshoe:\nHmm...\n\n\n\n\nThe DL-6 Incident\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe, please, help us...\nGumshoe:\nH-huh?\nPhoenix:\nWe need to know about the DL-6 Incident!\nGumshoe:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nThat was when Edgeworth's father died. I can't help but think that it has something to do with this current case.\nGumshoe:\n... To tell the truth, I don't know much about DL-6 either. Mr. Edgeworth forbade us from reading the file. So... I'm afraid I can't show them to you, either, pal.\nMaya:\nWhat!?\nGumshoe:\nHowever... If you can convince me somehow that the DL-6 Incident is related to this case... Well, I guess I'd consider opening the file up.Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetal Detector\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThanks, Detective Gumshoe. This was really helpful.\nGumshoe:\nR-really?\nMaya:\nYou seem surprised!\nGumshoe:\nHuh? N-no, not at all. Glad it worked out for you.\n\n\n\n\nParrot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nWhat's that? A parrot?\nPhoenix:\nThe old man at the boat rental shop's parrot. The parrot knew about that \"incident\"...\nGumshoe:\nThat incident?\nPhoenix:\nDL-6.\nGumshoe:\nWh-what!?\n\n\nMaya:\nPolly! Polly! Have we forgotten something?\nParrot:\n*squawk* \"Don't forget DL-6!\" *squawk*\nMaya:\nH-huh!?\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI'm pretty sure that old man must have taught her that word...\nGumshoe:\nYeah, but how would that old man know about the DL-6 Incident?\nPhoenix:\nWait! What if... What if that old man was connected to DL-6?\nMaya:\nN-Nick! You think he might be!?\nGumshoe:\n...After clearing all Talk options and presenting Parrot:Gumshoe:\n... I get ya. Sounds like you need information on the DL-6 Incident. Through there is the Station's Records Room. I'll give you special permission to go in and find what you need.Maya:\nAll right! Way to go, Detective Gumshoe! Okay, Nick! To the Records Room!Phoenix:\n(I guess it's time we faced Edgeworth's past...)December 26Police DepartmentRecords RoomMaya:\nWow!!! It's amazing.........ly dusty.Phoenix:\nTen years of files and ten years of dust, I guess.Maya:\nLet's find that DL-6 stuff quick!Phoenix:\n(Fifteen years ago... both me and Edgeworth were nine years old. We were almost through with fourth grade when he suddenly transferred. Because of DL-6...?)Maya:\nNick! I found out where the file is!Phoenix:\nO-oh, thanks!Maya:\nJust let me know what you want to know about the DL-6 Incident! I'll go get the right file!Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlass case\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like there are files inside that glass case. The case is so dusty I can't see what's inside.\nMaya:\nNick... it's locked.\nPhoenix:\nThey must keep important case files in there.\n\n\n\n\nBack wall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere are shelves stuffed with case files in the back of the room, too. Forgotten cases, rotting away for eternity...\nMaya:\nNick, let's get what we need and get out of here. All this dust is getting to me!\n\n\n\n\nCabinet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThis cabinet is where they keep evidence for current cases. Some of the things are obviously murder weapons. Others are... who knows what. Most of it just looks like random junk.\nMaya:\nNick... what do you think this clothespin is for?\nPhoenix:\nDon't touch that! It's evidence...\n\n\n\n\nShelves\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHere are files of collected case reports. There's quite a large volume of reports here.\nMaya:\nWow... these are all case reports!?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. It's like a graveyard of police cases.\nMaya:\nI guess my sister's case report is in here too... quietly gathering dust.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe case summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, first I have to get a handle on the main facts... like a summary.\nMaya:\nRight. Summary... summary... Found it! Here you go.\nPhoenix:\nDecember 28... 2001.\nMaya:\nThat's exactly 15 years ago from the day after tomorrow!\nPhoenix:\n(So in two days, the case is closed...) The incident took place in the elevator of the district courthouse. (Changed from [The incident took place in the elevator of the district court.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nWhat!? Is this the same district courthouse where we're holding the trial now!? (Changed from [Is this the same district court where we're holding the trial now!?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nLooks like it. There was a large earthquake at 2:00 PM on that day. Part of the court building collapsed, and all of the lights went out.\nMaya:\nWow... that was some earthquake!\nPhoenix:\nAt the time, three people were trapped in the elevator. It took five hours for them to be rescued... Five hours!\nMaya:\nThat would be scary like that, in the dark!\nPhoenix:\nThere was a lack of oxygen in the elevator, and the survivors were unconscious.\nMaya:\nThe survivors...?\nPhoenix:\nOne of the three in the elevator had been shot... in the heart.\nMaya:\nThat was Mr. Edgeworth's father... wasn't it.\nPhoenix:\n(He said that his father was shot before his very eyes... So Miles Edgeworth was one of the other passengers in that elevator.)\n\n\n\n\nVictim data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nDo you have data on the victim... Edgeworth's father?\nMaya:\nYeah, hold on... Victim... victim... Here! Found it!\nPhoenix:\nGregory Edgeworth, 35, defense attorney. If he were still alive, he'd be 50. He had lost that day's case in court, and got in the elevator with his son, Miles.\nMaya:\n\"Miles\"...!\nPhoenix:\nMiles Edgeworth, of course.\nMaya:\nSo he was on the elevator with his father!\nPhoenix:\nFrom the angle of the bullet and the other evidence, it could not have been a suicide... The murder weapon, a pistol, was found in the elevator. The pistol had been fired two times. (Where have I heard that before...? Huh...! It sounds just like this current case! What's going on here?)\n\n\n\n\nSuspect data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nGot any data on the suspect in there?\nMaya:\nHmm... that would be the guy that my mom got arrested. Hold on... this is it.\nPhoenix:\nThe man arrested as a suspect in DL-6 was... Yanni Yogi? He was a clerk in the court, apparently.\nMaya:\nSo he must have been the third person in the elevator. Well, then he had to have done it!\nPhoenix:\nBut... he was found innocent. Thanks to his defense lawyer, Robert Hammond.\nMaya:\nHammond... the victim in our case!\nPhoenix:\nRight. The suspect, Mr. Yogi was oxygen deprived... so much so he had brain damage. He lost all memory of being in the elevator. After he was declared innocent, he disappeared.\nMaya:\nHmm... where could Yogi have gone to, I wonder?\nPhoenix:\n(He may be closer than we think...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nLet's just hurry up and read these files! This place is so dusty, I want to finish up and get out of here...After clearing all Talk options:Phoenix:\nI guess I know generally what happened in DL-6 now. I still don't know what sort of impact the whole thing had on Edgeworth...Maya:\nNick. Are we going to take the whole file? There's too much! We'll never get it out.Phoenix:\nY-you're right. How about we just take what we think we'll need...DL-6 Case File added to the Court Record.Phoenix:\nRight. That's probably all we'll be able to find here. Now, all that's left is the trial tomorrow... I wonder how \"Dad\" will do testifying in court...To be continued.Nothing to examine during investigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nNo clues here.Turnabout Goodbyes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranscriptPart 1\n\nPart 2\n\nPart 3\n\nPart 4\n\nPart 5\n\nPart 6December 27, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Miles Edgeworth.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Karma:\n... ...Judge:\nVery well, apparently the prosecution is also ready.Phoenix:\n(Who is the judge here, anyway!?)Judge:\nMr. von Karma, your opening statement.Karma:\n... ...Judge:\nEr... very well, no opening statement so...Karma:Karma:\nNot so fast, Judge! I was taking a meaningful pause before speaking!Judge:\nR-right, of course.Karma:\nA prediction! Today's trial will end three minutes from now!Judge:\nOrder... order! Mr. von Karma! What is the meaning of your statement just now!?Karma:Karma:\nBah! Must you question everything! It will be over in three minutes! We have no time to waste! I'll call my witness now!Judge:\nR-right...Karma:\nI call my witness... my decisive witness to the stand!Phoenix:\n(It's that mysterious boat shop owner.)Karma:\nWitness... state your profession.Uncle:\nMmph... zzzz... ... I, er, am the proprietor of the restaurant the \"Wet Noodle\" at Gourd Lake.Karma:\n...Uncle:\nAnd I, er, also rent boats.Karma:\nThe night of the incident, you were in the boat rental shop, correct?Uncle:\nEr... ayup, yup I was.Karma:\nPlease testify.Phoenix:\n(Wait a second... We still haven't heard who this old guy is!)Raise an objection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Wait a minute!\"Let it slide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(On second thought, I guess it doesn't really matter.)\nMaya:\nDoesn't matter!? What are you thinking, Nick!? What if that old man had something to do with the DL-6 Incident? If we don't find out who he is, we won't be able to build a case here!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, she has a point.)\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Wait a minute!\"Phoenix:\nWait a minute! The witness hasn't stated his name yet!Karma:Karma:\nBecause I did not ask him, Mr. Wright! Bah! I have predicted this trial will end in three minutes! Stop asking trivial questions and cooperate!Phoenix:\n(Yeah, right!)Judge:\nThe witness will state his name.Uncle:\nZzzz... ... Mmph! Well, er... I'm not really sure, ayup.Judge:\nWhat do you mean?Uncle:\nMy, er, memory...Karma:\nYour Honor... The witness does not remember anything beyond the last several years... Ergo, he cannot recall his own name.Judge:\nHmm... he can't recall, you say?Karma:\nYes, but the incident in question took place three days ago. He can testify.Judge:\nVery well. Let's hear his testimony then, shall we. Witness?Witness Testimony-- The Night of the Murder --Uncle:\nIt was the night of the 24th, just after midnight, ayup.\nI was in the restaurant... where I er... rent boats, as usual.\nThen I heard a \"bang!\" Ayup.\nWhen I looked out the window, I saw a boat just a' floating on the lake.\nThen I heard another \"bang.\"\nJust about then the boat comes back to the shore, and a man walks by my window.Judge:\nHmm...Very well. I'd like to begin the cross-examination...Karma:Karma:\nThere is nothing to question in my witness's testimony! Ergo, no need for cross-examination! Besides, there are only 10 seconds left before our three minutes are up! Judge! Your verdict, now!Judge:\nEr... yes... M-Mr. Wright...?Cross-examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat are you saying!? Of course I'll cross-examine the witness!\nJudge:\nHmm... Very well, you may begin.\nLeads to:\n\"Raaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!\"Don't cross-examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(He's right. That testimony sounded pretty solid. Maybe I should hold back.)\nMaya:\nB-but, Nick! You have to cross-examine him! This is your only chance to turn this trial around! Your last chance!\nPhoenix:\n(O-oh... right.)\nLeads to:\n\"Raaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!\"Karma:\nRaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!Judge:\nE-excuse me? Mr. von Karma?Karma:\nThree minutes just passed.Judge:\nI see.

I'm surprised you seem so sure about it today.\nUncle:\n...\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nI asked him, and he remembered. Isn't that right!?\nUncle:\nZzzz... D-don't glare at me like that...! I, er... I remembered it clearly, I did. Ayup.\nKarma:\nYou see? Continue!Uncle:\nI was in the restaurant... where I er... rent boats, as usual.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nIs there anyone who can verify that?\nUncle:\n... Well, I guess Polly could.\nPhoenix:\nTh-that's not good enough for a court of law!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright... exactly what's not good enough?\nPhoenix:\nAh, uh, Your Honor, this \"Polly\" is a parrot.\nJudge:\nA... parrot?\nUncle:\nDon't be so hard on the girl, Keithy-boy!\nJudge:\nKeith...?\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nThe prosecution concedes that we cannot prove the witness was in the shop.

But I figure there was two men out there, ayup.\nPhoenix:\nBut you couldn't see them clearly!\nUncle:\nAyup... at the time, that is.\nPhoenix:\n(At the time...?)Uncle:\nThen I heard another \"bang.\"Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you heard two gunshots total?\nUncle:\nAyup.\nPhoenix:\n(That's what Lotta said in her testimony yesterday.)Uncle:\nJust about then the boat comes back to the shore, and a man walks by my window.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"By your window\"?\nUncle:\nAyup, by my window. Right outside the window of my little shack.\nPhoenix:\nAnd, could you see the man's face?\nUncle:\nWell, the fog was pretty darn thick, but he was right there in front of me.

We proved in yesterday's court that it could not have been Edgeworth who fired the gun!\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nMr. Wright. Are you referring to the fingerprints from Edgeworth's right hand found on the gun, and the photograph showing a man firing with his left hand...?\nPhoenix:\nExactly!\nKarma:\nThat is easily explainable! He could have wiped his prints after he fired! You are ignoring the truth of the matter here! Everything in this witness's testimony is true!\nLeads to:\n\"Hmm...\"Wait and see what happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(But... how can I raise an objection without any proof?)\nKarma:\nJudge!

In a court of law, the evidence tells all. Apparently, you have yet to realize even this basic fact. If you say his testimony is a lie, show us proof!\nPhoenix:\nUrk...\nMaya:\nNick! Do we have evidence...?\nLeads to:\n\"It's no good! There's nothing I can do.\"Wait and see what happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I can't see any room to raise an objection... I'd better hold back and see how things develop.)\nMaya:\nNick! We have to do something! If we stay quiet now, Mr. Edgeworth'll be found guilty for sure!\nLeads to:\n\"It's no good! There's nothing I can do.\"Phoenix:\nIt's no good! There's nothing I can do.Maya:\nA... are you sure?Phoenix:\nTo be honest... I don't know what to do anymore.Maya:\nPlease... Can you hear me, Sis? Please... We need your help... Nick needs you...Karma:\nTsk tsk tsk... Three minutes was perhaps too high an expectation. However, fifteen minutes isn't bad! This must be a new record.Judge:\nEnough! The witness may leave the stand.Uncle:\nZzzz...Judge:\nThis court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant.

No!)Karma:\nHmph.Judge:\nThis court find the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth...GuiltyJudge:\nThe accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date.

I heard it too!Judge:\nO-order!Karma:Karma:\nWhat is the meaning of this!? The verdict has been decided! I call for adjournment!Judge:\nOne moment, Mr. von Karma. So, you say you heard a gunshot?Butz:\nYeah, I did! A gunshot! That night! I was sitting here in the audience, listening to the testimony... Then I realized, something he said was different from what I remember! A-anyhow, I can't just sit here and let you call Edgey a murderer! It's... It's just not right! I'll testify! Lemme testify!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Well, this is the first time something has happened like this in my court. I'm not quite sure how to proceed...Karma:\nJudge! You've already given your decision! The trial is over!Maya:\nNick! This is it! Larry's given us one final chance at this!Phoenix:\n(She's right! If only it wasn't Larry... He could make things even worse...)Maya:\nMr. Edgeworth was just declared guilty, Nick! It doesn't get any worse!Phoenix:\nYou're right! Okay! Your Honor! If there is another witness, it is our duty to hear him speak! Right here! Right now!Karma:\nA waste of time! The verdict cannot be overturned!Judge:\nHmm... ... ... Allow me to speak my opinion. In all court proceedings, it is our duty to prevent an inaccurate verdict. In order to make sure no mistake has been made, every witness should be heard!Karma:\nWh-what is this!?Judge:\nI withdraw my previous verdict of \"guilty\"! Mr. von Karma! I order you to call this new witness to testify. Now!Karma:\nWhaaaat!Judge:\nThe court will adjourn for a five minute recess. After that, we will hear this new witness. Court is adjourned!December 27, 10:28 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2Phoenix:\nWhew... That was too close. Sorry to keep you on the edge of your seat like that, Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\nHmph. I've seen worse.Phoenix:\n(Yeah right, Edgeworth. You're sweating bullets!) I just wonder what Larry plans to say in there.Maya:\nLarry was at the lake that night?Phoenix:\nYes... He said he went looking for the Steel Samurai balloon that flew into the lake.Maya:\nOh right. And he found the balloon and the air tank that night?Phoenix:\nYeah.Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\nHey, Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\n... Huh? You say something, Wright?Phoenix:\nYeah, a lot of things. You seem out of it. What's wrong?Edgeworth:\nIt... it's nothing.Phoenix:\nHmm?Maya:\nUmm... Mr. Edgeworth? There's something I've been meaning to ask you.Edgeworth:\nWhat's that?Maya:\nWhy are your fingerprints on the murder weapon?Edgeworth:\nOh. When he fell into the lake, I went into a daze. I couldn't understand what had happened. I couldn't think straight. Then I saw the pistol lying on the floor of the boat in front of me. I picked it up without thinking. I didn't have a reason, really.Maya:\nI see...Edgeworth:\nWright...Phoenix:\nYeah?Edgeworth:\nThis might be our chance.Phoenix:\nOur chance?Edgeworth:\nvon Karma has only ever run perfect trials.Phoenix:\nPerfect trials...?Edgeworth:\nPerfectly prepared witnesses, perfectly complete evidence. That's the secret to his success. This is the first time he's ever had to deal with something unexpected! He has to let someone he hasn't even talked to testify before the court! (Changed from [He has let someone he hasn't even talked to testify before the court!] in the original release) And that someone... is Larry!Phoenix:\nWhat are you getting at?Edgeworth:\nIt's likely his testimony will be full of holes, Wright.Maya:\nThat's right, Nick! No ten minute trial this time! We'll milk this one for all it's worth!Phoenix:\nHey, it was fifteen minutes! Fifteen! (Everything's on Larry now...) (Changed from [Hey, it was fifteen minutes! Fifteen! (Everything depends on Larry now...)] in the original release)December 27, 10:35 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:\nCourt is now back in session. Witness... Please testify to the court about everything that you saw... on the night of December 24th.Butz:\nRight... leave it to me!Phoenix:\n(Please, Larry, don't mess this one up!!! I hate to admit it, but you're our last chance!)Karma:\n...Phoenix:\n(von Karma didn't even have time to prep his witness. I just hope Edgeworth is right about this being our big break...)Witness Testimony-- The Night of the Murder --Butz:\nThat night, I was out in a boat on the lake.\nI was looking for something and I, er, found it.\nSo I quietly slipped the boat back in at the rental shop dock.\nThen, just as I was thinking about going home, I heard this \"bang\"!\nI looked out over the lake, but I didn't notice the boat.\nSo after I heard that single gunshot I went home.Judge:\nHmm... That was an unusually vague testimony, even for this court. In any matter, Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor...Maya:\nWhat's wrong, Nick?Phoenix:\nIt's Larry! I have no idea what he's going to say if I press him. I'm a little scared.Maya:\nHmm... Well, we've come this far. There's no way to go but forward, Nick!Cross Examination-- The Night of the Murder --Butz:\nThat night, I was out in a boat on the lake.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\nSomething wrong, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nThere were so many things wrong I don't know where to begin...\nJudge:\nAh...\nPhoenix:\nUm, well, okay. First of all, what time was it?\nButz:\nOh, it was after 11:00 when I went out in the boat. By that time everyone had gone home for the night. So I waited until the coast was clear, so to speak.\nPhoenix:\nAnd why were you out on a boat at such a late hour...?Butz:\nI was looking for something and I, er, found it.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Looking for something\"...?\nButz:\nEr, yeah.\nJudge:\nMr. Butz, what was it you were looking for?\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nWhat the witness was searching for is irrelevant! Most likely he was hunting for this \"Gourdy\"!\nPhoenix:\n(You know, it wouldn't surprise me one bit if that was the truth.)\nKarma:\nThis is all irrelevant! Let's get it over with.Butz:\nSo I quietly slipped the boat back in at the rental shop dock.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAround what time was that?\nButz:\nUh... Well, let's see... I figured I was out searching for about an hour... I guess it was around 12:00. Yeah.\nJudge:\nYou're not sure?\nButz:\nHey! Don't give me that face! I'm not some sort of human sundial, okay!?\nPhoenix:\n(People use watches these days, Larry...)Butz:\nThen, just as I was thinking about going home, I heard this \"bang\"!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhere did the sound come from?\nButz:\nYeah, well, I wasn't too sure about that. I looked around, y'know.\nJudge:\nDid you look at the lake?\nButz:\nYeah, I looked.Butz:\nI looked out over the lake, but I didn't notice the boat.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWasn't there a boat on the lake!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Well? Mr. Butz!\nButz:\nWhoa, whoa. Everybody just calm down, okay? I mean, it was real foggy that night. I'm not sure whether there was a boat out there or not.\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, okay, no problem. That's just the MOST IMPORTANT PART of the case!!!)\nKarma:\nHmph!Butz:\nSo after I heard that single gunshot I went home.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, you only heard one \"bang\" correct?\nButz:\nYeah.\nPhoenix:\n(Huh.)Present Lotta's Deposition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"W-wait a sec, Larry!\"Maya:\nWell, Nick?Phoenix:\nHmm... It was a pretty wishy-washy testimony, wasn't it? I guess I should just start working on the contradictions.Maya:\nSorry...\nI wish I could be more helpful.

You're sure!?Butz:\nThat's what I said!Phoenix:\nBut Mr. Lotta Hart testified yesterday that she heard two \"bang\"s! And the old man just now said the same thing! They both heard two gunshots that night!Butz:\nHuh?Phoenix:\nWere you even listening!?

I'm not sure.Judge:\nEh...?Phoenix:\nNot sure!? H-how could you not be sure?Butz:\nYeah, well... I, uh, I might have missed the other gunshot. I was, uh, listening to something else...Phoenix:\nSomething... else?Butz:\nMy radio, dude! With my headphones. (Changed from [My radio, dude! On my headphones.] in the original release)Phoenix:\nWhaaaaaaat!?Judge:\nOrder! Order! And stop that booing! M-Mr. Butz! You were listening to the radio with your headphones? (Changed from [You were listening to a radio on earphones?] in the original release)Butz:\nY-yeah! So what! That a crime!? I listen to my radio! Everybody listens to the radio! What's the big deal!?Judge:\nHmm... Mr. von Karma... your opinion?Karma:\nWaste of time. I do not accept this witness, nor his shoddy testimony.Judge:\nHmm... Well, Mr. Wright?

In fact, I think we've all heard enough.)\nMaya:\nWhat are you saying, Nick!? If you stop now, Mr. Edgeworth will be found guilty!

Please... please allow the witness to continue his testimony.Karma:\nBah! Nothing is more pitiful than a lawyer who doesn't know when he's lost!Judge:\nVery well, Mr. Butz. Please give your testimony, and be sure to include details like your RADIO.Butz:\nRight! Leave it to me!Phoenix:\n(I wouldn't if there were any other way out of this, believe me.)Witness Testimony-- What Larry Heard --Butz:\nIt's lonely, being alone on Christmas Eve!\nThat's why I was listening to an all-requests show on the radio, see?\nI was listening to it real booming loud, like.\nBut I'm sure I heard that gunshot!\nI remember exactly what the DJ was saying when I heard it, too.Judge:\nYou were listening to your radio... at a high volume!?Butz:\nYeah, what's the big problem? Can't a man listen to his radio in peace? Isn't this a free country!?Phoenix:\n(I truly believe Larry has no idea what the problem here is.)Karma:\nJudge. Can you believe a word this witness says? What he heard was probably nothing more than a drum beat from the radio!Judge:\nTrue enough, it is difficult to believe this testimony.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nWait, Your Honor! The witness said he remembers exactly what the DJ said when he heard the gunshot!Judge:\nExcuse me? \"Dee-jay\"...?Phoenix:\nAn announcer... the guy who says things on the radio. Anyway! What this means is, when he heard the sound, no music was playing! The DJ only talks between songs! So he could have heard the gunshot from the lake!

      "newContext": "-- The Night of the Murder --Butz:\nThat night, I was out in a boat on the lake.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\nSomething wrong, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nThere were so many things wrong I don't know where to begin...\nJudge:\nAh...\nPhoenix:\nUm, well, okay. First of all, what time was it?\nButz:\nOh, it was after 11:00 when I went out in the boat. By that time everyone had gone home for the night. So I waited until the coast was clear, so to speak.\nPhoenix:\nAnd why were you out on a boat at such a late hour...?Butz:\nI was looking for something and I, er, found it.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Looking for something\"...?\nButz:\nEr, yeah.\nJudge:\nMr. Butz, what was it you were looking for?\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nWhat the witness was searching for is irrelevant! Most likely he was hunting for this \"Gourdy\"!\nPhoenix:\n(You know, it wouldn't surprise me one bit if that was the truth.)\nKarma:\nThis is all irrelevant! Let's get it over with.Butz:\nSo I quietly slipped the boat back in at the rental shop dock.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAround what time was that?\nButz:\nUh... Well, let's see... I figured I was out searching for about an hour... I guess it was around 12:00. Yeah.\nJudge:\nYou're not sure?\nButz:\nHey! Don't give me that face! I'm not some sort of human sundial, okay!?\nPhoenix:\n(People use watches these days, Larry...)Butz:\nThen, just as I was thinking about going home, I heard this \"bang\"!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhere did the sound come from?\nButz:\nYeah, well, I wasn't too sure about that. I looked around, y'know.\nJudge:\nDid you look at the lake?\nButz:\nYeah, I looked.Butz:\nI looked out over the lake, but I didn't notice the boat.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWasn't there a boat on the lake!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Well? Mr. Butz!\nButz:\nWhoa, whoa. Everybody just calm down, okay? I mean, it was real foggy that night. I'm not sure whether there was a boat out there or not.\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, okay, no problem. That's just the MOST IMPORTANT PART of the case!!!)\nKarma:\nHmph!Butz:\nSo after I heard that single gunshot I went home.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, you only heard one \"bang\" correct?\nButz:\nYeah.\nPhoenix:\n(Huh.)Present Lotta's Deposition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"W-wait a sec, Larry!\"Maya:\nWell, Nick?Phoenix:\nHmm... It was a pretty wishy-washy testimony, wasn't it? I guess I should just start working on the contradictions.Maya:\nSorry...\nI wish I could be more helpful. I wish I could call my sister...Phoenix:\nW-wait a sec, Larry!Butz:\nWh-what!?Phoenix:\nYou only heard one \"bang\"!? You're sure!?Butz:\nThat's what I said!Phoenix:\nBut Mr. Lotta Hart testified yesterday that she heard two \"bang\"s! And the old man just now said the same thing! They both heard two gunshots that night!Butz:\nHuh?Phoenix:\nWere you even listening!? Were you paying attention at all to what they said?Butz:\nYo, Nick, please!Phoenix:\nHuh?Butz:\nYou know, something's been bothering me. I'm a witness, see? I'm like a customer here!

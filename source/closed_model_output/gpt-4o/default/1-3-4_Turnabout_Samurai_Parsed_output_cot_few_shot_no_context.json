Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nYes?Will:\nWhy do you look so... unhappy?Phoenix:\nO-oh! Oh, nothing! Eh heh heh. Really, it's nothing. Right, Mia? (Uh oh. She looks even unhappier...)Mia:\nPhoenix. Your client is now practically a dead man walking... Perhaps that's why I feel particularly close to him.Phoenix:\nThis is no time for dead-people jokes, please.Mia:\nYou know we're going into this trial utterly defenseless. Yet, if Mr. Powers is truly innocent... We should be able to find something overlooked in the evidence to prove it.Phoenix:\nSomething \"overlooked\"...?Mia:\nWe have to find something, Phoenix, today. It's that, or lose the trial.Phoenix:\n(This isn't going to be easy.)October 19, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:\nThe court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:\nVery well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth:\nAn unexpected fact has come to the attention of the court. Yesterday, we learned that there were other people present at the studios. Today, I would like to show evidence proving they had nothing to do with the murder.Judge:\nVery well. You may call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth.Phoenix:\n(I wonder if it'll be that producer...) (Changed from [I wonder if that producer is going to come out...] in the original release)Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution calls Mr. Sal Manella to the stand.Phoenix:\n(...or that director.)Edgeworth:\nWill the witness state his name and profession?Manella:\n... How r00d can j00 get! J00 don't know ME!? I'm the director! I make the Steel Samurai, n00b! ROFL!Edgeworth:\n...Manella:\nS... Sal Manella. I'm a director. Television.Judge:\nWere you at Global Studios on the day of the murder?Manella:\nY-yes, Your Honor.Judge:\nHmm... Very well. Please testify to the court about the events of that day.Mia:\nPhoenix. Let's start by picking this testimony apart. If Powers is innocent, you know what that means. Someone in the trailer on that day did it!Phoenix:\nR-right. (She doesn't waste any time putting on the pressure!)Witness Testimony-- The Day of the Murder --Manella:\nI was at the studios from around 9:00 that morning.\nDuring the morning, I was doing... umm... an action scene run-through.\nIt took a lot more time than I thought it would.\nI hear that everyone else ate lunch in the Employee Area...\nBut I had a meeting in the Studio Two trailer, so I ended up skipping lunch.\nWe were in the meeting until around 4:00...\nDuring the meeting, well, I'm pretty sure no one left their chairs.\nThat's about it.Judge:\nHmm... The time of Mr. Hammer's death was 2:30 PM. And according to your testimony, you were in a meeting at that time. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.Cross Examination-- The Day of the Murder --Manella:\nI was at the studios from around 9:00 that morning.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nIs that when you always come in to work?\nManella:\nOh, oh no. I come in all sort of hours. It's the \"industry\" way.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, I know all about the freaks in your \"industry\"...)\nManella:\nStill, FWIW, I was pretty busy all that day.\u00a0:(\nEdgeworth:\nTell us more about that.Manella:\nDuring the morning, I was doing... umm... an action scene run-through.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nIn the Employee Area?\nManella:\nThat's right. It was a fight scene between the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate.\nPhoenix:\nWas anyone else at the run-through?\nManella:\nOh, yeah. That security lady was sitting there watching the whole thing. LOL. She was cheering on Hammer, if you can believe it.\nPhoenix:\n(She certainly has the lungs for it...) Anyone else?\nManella:\nNope, just us four.Manella:\nIt took a lot more time than I thought it would.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy did it go on so long?\nManella:\nUm, I'm pretty sure j00've already heard about this... But WP twisted his ankle during the run-through, see...\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, right, thus the limp.)\nManella:\nWhich of course led to me missing my lunch. ROFS!\nPhoenix:\n(ROFS? Rolling on the Floor... Starving?)Manella:\nI hear that everyone else ate lunch in the Employee Area...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat exactly did they have for lunch?\nManella:\nT-bone steak! The assistant cooked some up.\nPhoenix:\n(Come to think of it, there was a plate with some bones on it in the Employee Area.)\nEdgeworth:\n\"Everyone else\" meaning that the witness did not eat with them.Manella:\nBut I had a meeting in the Studio Two trailer, so I ended up skipping lunch.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, in the end, you didn't get to eat?\nManella:\nYeah. No steak, at least! Can j00 believe it?\nPhoenix:\nThat must have been tough.\nMia:\nPhoenix.\nPhoenix:\nYeah?\nMia:\nDoesn't something about that seem odd to you?\n\n\n\nNot at all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, no, not really. Seems pretty straightforward.\nMia:\nOh. Perhaps I was wrong, then.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nIt's a little vague\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nActually, there is something bothering me. Mr. Manella, just now you said \"steak, at least.\" So you ate something other than steak?\nManella:\nYeah, good call! I had some chocolate in my pocket, which I used to stave off starvation!\nPhoenix:\nI see... (Is that all? I was sure I was on to something there.)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nIt's contradictory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYeah, it does seem odd, now that you mention it. Mr. Manella!\nManella:\nH-hmm? W-what do j00 mean? *sweats*\nPhoenix:\nWhen I went to Studio Two, I saw something on the table there. (Changed from [When I went to that trailer, I saw something on the table.] in the original release) There were two plates--the same kind of plates as the ones in the Employee Area. (Changed from [There were two plates on the table--the same kind of plates as in the Employee Area.] in the original release) Who ate lunch there?\nManella:\nM-mmpf! No, er, ah, um, eh heh. Good call! *sweats* I, er, I was embarrassed so I didn't mention it... But I did eat, after all.\nPhoenix:\nA t-bone steak, you mean?\nManella:\nYeah, well, I mean the assistant went through all that trouble... I brought it to the trailer thinking I could eat it later.\nPhoenix:\n(Clearly a man who likes to eat. I'd suspected as much...) So, when exactly did you eat it?\nManella:\nWe took one break during that meeting. I, er, wolfed it down then. *drool*\nPhoenix:\n(A mental image I will carry with me to my grave... Wait a second...! If they took a break in that meeting, that contradicts his testimony! I'll press on that one a bit more...)\nLeads back to cross-examinationManella:\nWe were in the meeting until around 4:00...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat were you discussing?\nManella:\nThe Steel Samurai story, and our budget. Get this! The sponsors turn to me and say, \"Mr. Manella. Those scripts of yours are not appropriate for children.\" Can j00 believe it!?\nPhoenix:\n(Actually, I kind of can.) So, nobody left the table during the whole meeting?Manella:\nDuring the meeting, well, I'm pretty sure no one left their chairs.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou didn't take a single break?\nManella:\nEr... well... Y-yeah! Not a one! *sweats*\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... what's he sweating so much about, I wonder? If only I had an idea... I'll wait for one to come up and hit him with it later.)Press (after selecting \"It's contradictory\" upon pressing fifth statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou didn't take a single break?\nManella:\nEr... well... Y-yeah! Not a one! *sweats*\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... what's he sweating so much about, I wonder? If only I had an idea... Wait a second... Maybe I do have an idea!)\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Wait a second!\"\n\n\n\n\nLeave him be\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, on second thought, I'm drawing a blank. If I press too hard in the wrong place, I'll just end up scaring him into silence. Maybe I'll just sit back and see what happens.)\nLeads back to cross-examinationMia:\nPhoenix. If his alibi holds, Powers is finished. Press him as hard as you can and find out where he's lying!Phoenix:\nR-right!Phoenix:\nWait a second! Mr. Manella, you've just contradicted yourself! Didn't you just tell the court that you ate that t-bone steak during a break?Manella:\nOops! ROFL!Phoenix:\nWell?Manella:\nUmm...Judge:\nMr. Manella, what's this all about?Manella:\nW-well, yeah, I guess we did take a little break.Mia:\nPhoenix! Great job! If they took a break, one of them could have gone to the studio during that time!Phoenix:\nYour Honor! I call on the witness to testify to the court about this break!Judge:\nVery well. Mr. Manella, your testimony, please.Manella:\nUrk!Edgeworth:\nHeh heh heh...Phoenix:\n(Uh oh. Edgeworth is laughing...)Witness Testimony-- The Break --Manella:\nYeah, FWIW, we took a break... ROFL!\nBut it was only 15 minutes! 15! That's only 13 in Base 12!\nNot enough time for someone to, say, commit murder in Studio One! LOL!\nThat's only just enough time to eat a t-bone steak, if you ask me! *steams*Judge:\nHmm... I don't think it would even be enough time for that, but that's just me. Very well. You may begin the cross-examination.Cross Examination-- The Break --Manella:\nYeah, FWIW, we took a break... ROFL!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat time exactly did you take this break?\nManella:\nHmm... I'd say it was from around 2:30 or so until 2:45.\nPhoenix:\n(2:30!!! That's the time of death! So he could have gone to Studio One, killed Hammer, and come back... I guess it's possible, time-wise...)\nEdgeworth:\n...Manella:\nBut it was only 15 minutes! 15! That's only 13 in Base 12!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat were you doing for those 15 minutes?\nManella:\nEating my t-bone steak! What else!?\nPhoenix:\nThere were two plates on the trailer table...?\nManella:\nOh, right. The other one was Diva's... sorry, Dee Vasquez's plate.\nPhoenix:\n(Dee Vasquez... the producer.)\nEdgeworth:\nTo eat a t-bone steak in 15 minutes... that's quite a feat.Manella:\nNot enough time for someone to, say, commit murder in Studio One! LOL!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy is that?Press (after pressing first statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Why is that?\"Manella:\nThat's only just enough time to eat a t-bone steak, if you ask me! *steams*Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nI have to say, you look like a guy who gets through his meals pretty fast.\nManella:\nWell, I was facing a cold, slightly chewy t-bone steak... Even I have to take my time eating that kind of food. LOLMia:\nWell, Phoenix?Phoenix:\nThat testimony was too short to wring any kind of useful information out of!Mia:\nAll you have to do is prove that he was able to go to Studio One in that time!Phoenix:\n(Oh, great. Is that all...)Phoenix:\nWhy is that?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nHaven't we had enough of this pointless line of questioning? Your Honor! The testimony to this point has made one certain fact painfully clear: The people in the trailer had nothing to do with this murder! It was impossible for any of them to go to Studio One!Phoenix:\nWhat!?Edgeworth:\nSomething wrong, Mr. Wright? Surely you aren't suggesting one of the people in the trailer went to Studio One!Judge:\nHmm... Well, Mr. Wright?Mia:\nPhoenix, this is critical! Think about it before you give your answer!Judge:\nDo you claim someone from the trailer went to Studio One?I claim it, and claim it loud\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If I agree to let everyone in that trailer off the hook then the trial is over... Mr. Powers will be found guilty for sure!) The victim was murdered at 2:30, the exact time of the break in the meeting. With 15 minutes, murder is certainly a possibility!\nJudge:\nHmm... I suppose you might say that...\nPhoenix:\n(Alright, I've got the judge thinking now!)\nEdgeworth:\nTsk, tsk, tsk... Never a dull moment with you, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nWhat's your point, Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nYou've been doing your homework, haven't you? Look at the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nThe Court Record...?\nEdgeworth:\nSurely, you knew that from 2:15 to 4:00 the path between the studios was blocked? Mrs. Monkey's head had fallen across the path!\nPhoenix:\nWhoa! You're right!\nEdgeworth:\nTrue, the break in the trailer meeting came right at the time of death... However! The path from there to the scene of the crime was blocked! The fallen Mrs. Monkey head barred the way!\nPhoenix:\n... (It's actually \"Mr. Monkey,\" but Edgeworth has a point... And somehow, I feel no desire to correct him.)\nJudge:\nNo counter-argument, Mr. Wright? Then I'm afraid you lose this round.\nLeads to:\n\"I believe we have seen enough evidence.\"No, it's impossible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I don't want to write off so many possible suspects... But I can't keep claiming the impossible, either...) I agree that it was impossible for anyone in the trailer to go to the studio in that time.\nEdgeworth:\nHa hah! I thought you might be thoughtlessly treading on thin ice again! But I see you had at least an inkling of the truth.\nJudge:\nWhat do you mean, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's quite simple... True, the break in the trailer meeting came right at the time of death... However! The path from there to the scene of the crime was blocked! The fallen Mrs. Monkey head barred the way! At around 2:15, a strong gust of wind knocked off the studio mascot's head. Ergo! When the people in the trailer took a break at 2:30, the way to the studio was blocked. Blocked... by Mrs. Monkey's severed head!\nPhoenix:\n... (It's actually \"Mr. Monkey,\" but Edgeworth has a point... And somehow, I feel no desire to correct him.)\nLeads to:\n\"I believe we have seen enough evidence.\"Edgeworth:\nI believe we have seen enough evidence. I would like to relieve Mr. Manella from the stand.Phoenix:\n(Wh-what? It's over?)Judge:\nVery well. The court's opinion on this case is as follows: We have found that there were several other people in Studio 2 on the day of the murder. However, it is also clear that none of these people could have gone to Studio One. They therefore have no relation to this case. Furthermore, with regards to the photo of the Steel Samurai... Given the size of the costume, no one other than Mr. Powers could have worn it that day. All that is lacking is decisive evidence that he is the one who did it. If we had that, I'm afraid I would have to find Mr. Powers guilty.Edgeworth:\nYour Honor. The prosecution is pleased to announce that we indeed have decisive evidence: a witness.Judge:\nWho is this witness, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nMy witness saw the very moment when the Steel Samurai skewered the victim!Judge:\nOrder! I will have order! I see. The court will take a 10 minute recess, after which we will hear your witness. Court is adjourned for recess!October 19, 11:04 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Mia:\n...Phoenix:\nWhat do we do now, Mia? If everyone in that trailer has an alibi...Mia:\n... I'm sorry, Phoenix. I guess I was wrong.Phoenix:\nM-Mia! Don't tell me you're giving up! If you give up, what hope do I have...?Mia:\n... Don't get me wrong. I've never given up on a trial before, not while there was a chance. Only one thing became clear in your cross-examination. The people in the trailer could not have gone to Studio One. I thought there was more to it than that... But I was wrong. That's all there is.Will:\nUmm... Er... What's going to happen to me? It kinda seems like everyone in that courtroom thinks I did it... They think I'm a murderer!Mia:\nDon't worry, Mr. Powers. If you are innocent, we will prove it. I guarantee it. Leave it to us, and... be yourself. Be strong. You are the Steel Samurai, hero to children everywhere, after all.Will:\nI... You... Thanks. *sniff*Mia:\nOkay, Phoenix. This one's for the kids! Let's do it!October 19, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:\nCourt is back in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution has a concern. As our witness is a grade schooler of tender years, and this is a murder case... we worry that the defense might cause unnecessary trauma with his cruel questioning. (Changed from [We worry that the defense might cause unnecessary trauma with his cruel questioning!] in the original release)Phoenix:\n(Nice to see Edgeworth taking the moral high ground...)Edgeworth:\nHowever, we have no choice. The prosecution calls Cody Hackins to the stand.Edgeworth:\nYour Honor. Perhaps you could arrange a box for him to stand on?Judge:\nOh, r-right. Guard, please bring him a box. One of those donut crates should do.Edgeworth:\nWill the witness state his name and grade in school.Cody:\n...Edgeworth:\nWitness!Cody:\nWhat!? Just 'cause you're all grown-up don't mean you can push me around!Edgeworth:\nMrph...Mia:\nCody? Answer his question, okay?Cody:\nH-hey, it's you! The nice lady! I'm Cody Hackins. I'm in 2nd grade!Phoenix:\n(I get the feeling this is going to be a long, long day...)Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth. Please remember that you're speaking to a child. Try to be gentle.Edgeworth:\nM-mrrrrph! Witness! Er, I mean, Cody.Phoenix:\n(He's having trouble with this \"gentle\" thing.)Edgeworth:\nYou were present, er, you were at Global Studios on the day of the, er, incident?Cody:\nYou got a problem with that!?Edgeworth:\nPlease tell us what you saw that day.Cody:\nWhat, pops? You want me to tell you and gramps with the beard over there?Edgeworth:\nJust.. Mr. Edgeworth will be fine.Judge:\nI prefer \"bearded gentleman\" myself.Phoenix:\n(A very long day...)Judge:\nIncidentally, photographic equipment is strictly forbidden in this courtroom.Edgeworth:\nM-mpht! M-my apologies, Your Honor. He said he wouldn't testify if he couldn't bring it... I'd like special permission, if that's possible.Phoenix:\nWait, so you're saying you had to bargain terms with a kid... and you LOST?Cody:\nHey! I just got this new camera! Don't really know how to use it all that good yet! But I bring it with me wherever I go!Mia:\nPhoenix. I wonder if he had that camera on the day of the murder... You'd better make a note of it in the Court Record.Cody's Camera added to the Court Record.Judge:\nVery well, Cody. Please testify to the court about what you saw the day of the incident.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Cody:\nI wanted to see a Steel Samurai rehearsal, just once.\nI found a map on the Internet, and went to the studios that day.\nI went through the woods off the path, so that old lady wouldn't catch me.\nI was going for the studio.\nI got kinda lost on the way, though. For about 30 minutes.\nWhen I came out by the studio, there was the Steel Samurai!\nIt totally rocked! Right before my eyes, out came the bad guy!\nOf course, the Steel Samurai took him down! Pow!\nIf I had my camera with me, that woulda been the time for a shot, I tell you.\nAnyway, I couldn't get into the studio, so I went home.Judge:\nHmm... Very well. The defense may begin its cross-examination. But be gentle. Remember you're talking to a child. (Changed from [And, be gentle. Remember you're talking to a child.] in the original release)Cody:\n...Phoenix:\n(This kid is tougher than most adults we see in here, honestly...)Cross Examination",

Mrs. Monkey's head had fallen across the path!\nPhoenix:\nWhoa! You're right!\nEdgeworth:\nTrue, the break in the trailer meeting came right at the time of death... However! The path from there to the scene of the crime was blocked! The fallen Mrs. Monkey head barred the way!\nPhoenix:\n... (It's actually \"Mr. Monkey,\" but Edgeworth has a point... And somehow, I feel no desire to correct him.)\nJudge:\nNo counter-argument, Mr. Wright? Then I'm afraid you lose this round.\nLeads to:\n\"I believe we have seen enough evidence.\"No, it's impossible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I don't want to write off so many possible suspects... But I can't keep claiming the impossible, either...) I agree that it was impossible for anyone in the trailer to go to the studio in that time.\nEdgeworth:\nHa hah! I thought you might be thoughtlessly treading on thin ice again! But I see you had at least an inkling of the truth.\nJudge:\nWhat do you mean, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's quite simple... True, the break in the trailer meeting came right at the time of death... However! The path from there to the scene of the crime was blocked! The fallen Mrs. Monkey head barred the way! At around 2:15, a strong gust of wind knocked off the studio mascot's head. Ergo! When the people in the trailer took a break at 2:30, the way to the studio was blocked. Blocked... by Mrs. Monkey's severed head!\nPhoenix:\n... (It's actually \"Mr. Monkey,\" but Edgeworth has a point... And somehow, I feel no desire to correct him.)\nLeads to:\n\"I believe we have seen enough evidence.\"Edgeworth:\nI believe we have seen enough evidence. I would like to relieve Mr. Manella from the stand.Phoenix:\n(Wh-what? It's over?)Judge:\nVery well. The court's opinion on this case is as follows: We have found that there were several other people in Studio 2 on the day of the murder. However, it is also clear that none of these people could have gone to Studio One. They therefore have no relation to this case. Furthermore, with regards to the photo of the Steel Samurai... Given the size of the costume, no one other than Mr. Powers could have worn it that day. All that is lacking is decisive evidence that he is the one who did it. If we had that, I'm afraid I would have to find Mr. Powers guilty.Edgeworth:\nYour Honor. The prosecution is pleased to announce that we indeed have decisive evidence: a witness.Judge:\nWho is this witness, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nMy witness saw the very moment when the Steel Samurai skewered the victim!Judge:\nOrder! I will have order! I see. The court will take a 10 minute recess, after which we will hear your witness. Court is adjourned for recess!October 19, 11:04 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Mia:\n...Phoenix:\nWhat do we do now, Mia? If everyone in that trailer has an alibi...Mia:\n... I'm sorry, Phoenix. I guess I was wrong.Phoenix:\nM-Mia! Don't tell me you're giving up! If you give up, what hope do I have...?Mia:\n... Don't get me wrong. I've never given up on a trial before, not while there was a chance. Only one thing became clear in your cross-examination. The people in the trailer could not have gone to Studio One. I thought there was more to it than that... But I was wrong. That's all there is.Will:\nUmm... Er... What's going to happen to me? It kinda seems like everyone in that courtroom thinks I did it... They think I'm a murderer!Mia:\nDon't worry, Mr. Powers. If you are innocent, we will prove it. I guarantee it. Leave it to us, and... be yourself. Be strong. You are the Steel Samurai, hero to children everywhere, after all.Will:\nI... You... Thanks. *sniff*Mia:\nOkay, Phoenix. This one's for the kids! Let's do it!October 19, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:\nCourt is back in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution has a concern. As our witness is a grade schooler of tender years, and this is a murder case... we worry that the defense might cause unnecessary trauma with his cruel questioning. (Changed from [We worry that the defense might cause unnecessary trauma with his cruel questioning!] in the original release)Phoenix:\n(Nice to see Edgeworth taking the moral high ground...)Edgeworth:\nHowever, we have no choice. The prosecution calls Cody Hackins to the stand.Edgeworth:\nYour Honor. Perhaps you could arrange a box for him to stand on?Judge:\nOh, r-right. Guard, please bring him a box. One of those donut crates should do.Edgeworth:\nWill the witness state his name and grade in school.Cody:\n...Edgeworth:\nWitness!Cody:\nWhat!? Just 'cause you're all grown-up don't mean you can push me around!Edgeworth:\nMrph...Mia:\nCody? Answer his question, okay?Cody:\nH-hey, it's you! The nice lady! I'm Cody Hackins. I'm in 2nd grade!Phoenix:\n(I get the feeling this is going to be a long, long day...)Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth. Please remember that you're speaking to a child. Try to be gentle.Edgeworth:\nM-mrrrrph! Witness! Er, I mean, Cody.Phoenix:\n(He's having trouble with this \"gentle\" thing.)Edgeworth:\nYou were present, er, you were at Global Studios on the day of the, er, incident?Cody:\nYou got a problem with that!?Edgeworth:\nPlease tell us what you saw that day.Cody:\nWhat, pops? You want me to tell you and gramps with the beard over there?Edgeworth:\nJust.. Mr. Edgeworth will be fine.Judge:\nI prefer \"bearded gentleman\" myself.Phoenix:\n(A very long day...)Judge:\nIncidentally, photographic equipment is strictly forbidden in this courtroom.Edgeworth:\nM-mpht! M-my apologies, Your Honor. He said he wouldn't testify if he couldn't bring it... I'd like special permission, if that's possible.Phoenix:\nWait, so you're saying you had to bargain terms with a kid... and you LOST?Cody:\nHey! I just got this new camera! Don't really know how to use it all that good yet! But I bring it with me wherever I go!Mia:\nPhoenix. I wonder if he had that camera on the day of the murder... You'd better make a note of it in the Court Record.Cody's Camera added to the Court Record.Judge:\nVery well, Cody. Please testify to the court about what you saw the day of the incident.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Cody:\nI wanted to see a Steel Samurai rehearsal, just once.\nI found a map on the Internet, and went to the studios that day.\nI went through the woods off the path, so that old lady wouldn't catch me.\nI was going for the studio.\nI got kinda lost on the way, though. For about 30 minutes.\nWhen I came out by the studio, there was the Steel Samurai!\nIt totally rocked! Right before my eyes, out came the bad guy!\nOf course, the Steel Samurai took him down! Pow!\nIf I had my camera with me, that woulda been the time for a shot, I tell you.\nAnyway, I couldn't get into the studio, so I went home.Judge:\nHmm... Very well. The defense may begin its cross-examination. But be gentle. Remember you're talking to a child. (Changed from [And, be gentle. Remember you're talking to a child.] in the original release)Cody:\n...Phoenix:\n(This kid is tougher than most adults we see in here, honestly...)Cross Examination",

Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nYes?Will:\nWhy do you look so... unhappy?Phoenix:\nO-oh! Oh, nothing! Eh heh heh. Really, it's nothing. Right, Mia? (Uh oh. She looks even unhappier...)Mia:\nPhoenix. Your client is now practically a dead man walking... Perhaps that's why I feel particularly close to him.Phoenix:\nThis is no time for dead-people jokes, please.Mia:\nYou know we're going into this trial utterly defenseless. Yet, if Mr. Powers is truly innocent... We should be able to find something overlooked in the evidence to prove it.Phoenix:\nSomething \"overlooked\"...?Mia:\nWe have to find something, Phoenix, today. It's that, or lose the trial.Phoenix:\n(This isn't going to be easy.)October 19, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:\nThe court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:\nVery well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth:\nAn unexpected fact has come to the attention of the court. Yesterday, we learned that there were other people present at the studios. Today, I would like to show evidence proving they had nothing to do with the murder.Judge:\nVery well. You may call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth.Phoenix:\n(I wonder if it'll be that producer...) (Changed from [I wonder if that producer is going to come out...] in the original release)Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution calls Mr. Sal Manella to the stand.Phoenix:\n(...or that director.)Edgeworth:\nWill the witness state his name and profession?Manella:\n... How r00d can j00 get! J00 don't know ME!? I'm the director! I make the Steel Samurai, n00b! ROFL!Edgeworth:\n...Manella:\nS... Sal Manella. I'm a director. Television.Judge:\nWere you at Global Studios on the day of the murder?Manella:\nY-yes, Your Honor.Judge:\nHmm... Very well. Please testify to the court about the events of that day.Mia:\nPhoenix. Let's start by picking this testimony apart. If Powers is innocent, you know what that means. Someone in the trailer on that day did it!Phoenix:\nR-right. (She doesn't waste any time putting on the pressure!)Witness Testimony-- The Day of the Murder --Manella:\nI was at the studios from around 9:00 that morning.\nDuring the morning, I was doing... umm... an action scene run-through.\nIt took a lot more time than I thought it would.\nI hear that everyone else ate lunch in the Employee Area...\nBut I had a meeting in the Studio Two trailer, so I ended up skipping lunch.\nWe were in the meeting until around 4:00...\nDuring the meeting, well, I'm pretty sure no one left their chairs.\nThat's about it.Judge:\nHmm... The time of Mr. Hammer's death was 2:30 PM. And according to your testimony, you were in a meeting at that time. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.Cross Examination-- The Day of the Murder --Manella:\nI was at the studios from around 9:00 that morning.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nIs that when you always come in to work?\nManella:\nOh, oh no. I come in all sort of hours. It's the \"industry\" way.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, I know all about the freaks in your \"industry\"...)\nManella:\nStill, FWIW, I was pretty busy all that day.\u00a0:(\nEdgeworth:\nTell us more about that.Manella:\nDuring the morning, I was doing... umm... an action scene run-through.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nIn the Employee Area?\nManella:\nThat's right. It was a fight scene between the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate.\nPhoenix:\nWas anyone else at the run-through?\nManella:\nOh, yeah. That security lady was sitting there watching the whole thing. LOL. She was cheering on Hammer, if you can believe it.\nPhoenix:\n(She certainly has the lungs for it...) Anyone else?\nManella:\nNope, just us four.Manella:\nIt took a lot more time than I thought it would.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy did it go on so long?\nManella:\nUm, I'm pretty sure j00've already heard about this... But WP twisted his ankle during the run-through, see...\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, right, thus the limp.)\nManella:\nWhich of course led to me missing my lunch. ROFS!\nPhoenix:\n(ROFS? Rolling on the Floor... Starving?)Manella:\nI hear that everyone else ate lunch in the Employee Area...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat exactly did they have for lunch?\nManella:\nT-bone steak! The assistant cooked some up.\nPhoenix:\n(Come to think of it, there was a plate with some bones on it in the Employee Area.)\nEdgeworth:\n\"Everyone else\" meaning that the witness did not eat with them.Manella:\nBut I had a meeting in the Studio Two trailer, so I ended up skipping lunch.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, in the end, you didn't get to eat?\nManella:\nYeah. No steak, at least! Can j00 believe it?\nPhoenix:\nThat must have been tough.\nMia:\nPhoenix.\nPhoenix:\nYeah?\nMia:\nDoesn't something about that seem odd to you?\n\n\n\nNot at all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, no, not really. Seems pretty straightforward.\nMia:\nOh. Perhaps I was wrong, then.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nIt's a little vague\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nActually, there is something bothering me. Mr. Manella, just now you said \"steak, at least.\" So you ate something other than steak?\nManella:\nYeah, good call! I had some chocolate in my pocket, which I used to stave off starvation!\nPhoenix:\nI see... (Is that all? I was sure I was on to something there.)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nIt's contradictory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYeah, it does seem odd, now that you mention it. Mr. Manella!\nManella:\nH-hmm? W-what do j00 mean? *sweats*\nPhoenix:\nWhen I went to Studio Two, I saw something on the table there. (Changed from [When I went to that trailer, I saw something on the table.] in the original release) There were two plates--the same kind of plates as the ones in the Employee Area. (Changed from [There were two plates on the table--the same kind of plates as in the Employee Area.] in the original release) Who ate lunch there?\nManella:\nM-mmpf! No, er, ah, um, eh heh. Good call! *sweats* I, er, I was embarrassed so I didn't mention it... But I did eat, after all.\nPhoenix:\nA t-bone steak, you mean?\nManella:\nYeah, well, I mean the assistant went through all that trouble... I brought it to the trailer thinking I could eat it later.\nPhoenix:\n(Clearly a man who likes to eat. I'd suspected as much...) So, when exactly did you eat it?\nManella:\nWe took one break during that meeting. I, er, wolfed it down then. *drool*\nPhoenix:\n(A mental image I will carry with me to my grave... Wait a second...! If they took a break in that meeting, that contradicts his testimony! I'll press on that one a bit more...)\nLeads back to cross-examinationManella:\nWe were in the meeting until around 4:00...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat were you discussing?\nManella:\nThe Steel Samurai story, and our budget. Get this! The sponsors turn to me and say, \"Mr. Manella. Those scripts of yours are not appropriate for children.\" Can j00 believe it!?\nPhoenix:\n(Actually, I kind of can.) So, nobody left the table during the whole meeting?Manella:\nDuring the meeting, well, I'm pretty sure no one left their chairs.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou didn't take a single break?\nManella:\nEr... well... Y-yeah! Not a one! *sweats*\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... what's he sweating so much about, I wonder? If only I had an idea... I'll wait for one to come up and hit him with it later.)Press (after selecting \"It's contradictory\" upon pressing fifth statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou didn't take a single break?\nManella:\nEr... well... Y-yeah! Not a one! *sweats*\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... what's he sweating so much about, I wonder? If only I had an idea... Wait a second... Maybe I do have an idea!)\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Wait a second!\"\n\n\n\n\nLeave him be\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, on second thought, I'm drawing a blank. If I press too hard in the wrong place, I'll just end up scaring him into silence. Maybe I'll just sit back and see what happens.)\nLeads back to cross-examinationMia:\nPhoenix. If his alibi holds, Powers is finished. Press him as hard as you can and find out where he's lying!Phoenix:\nR-right!Phoenix:\nWait a second! Mr. Manella, you've just contradicted yourself! Didn't you just tell the court that you ate that t-bone steak during a break?Manella:\nOops! ROFL!Phoenix:\nWell?Manella:\nUmm...Judge:\nMr. Manella, what's this all about?Manella:\nW-well, yeah, I guess we did take a little break.Mia:\nPhoenix! Great job! If they took a break, one of them could have gone to the studio during that time!Phoenix:\nYour Honor! I call on the witness to testify to the court about this break!Judge:\nVery well. Mr. Manella, your testimony, please.Manella:\nUrk!Edgeworth:\nHeh heh heh...Phoenix:\n(Uh oh. Edgeworth is laughing...)Witness Testimony-- The Break --Manella:\nYeah, FWIW, we took a break... ROFL!\nBut it was only 15 minutes! 15! That's only 13 in Base 12!\nNot enough time for someone to, say, commit murder in Studio One! LOL!\nThat's only just enough time to eat a t-bone steak, if you ask me! *steams*Judge:\nHmm... I don't think it would even be enough time for that, but that's just me. Very well. You may begin the cross-examination.Cross Examination-- The Break --Manella:\nYeah, FWIW, we took a break... ROFL!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat time exactly did you take this break?\nManella:\nHmm... I'd say it was from around 2:30 or so until 2:45.\nPhoenix:\n(2:30!!! That's the time of death! So he could have gone to Studio One, killed Hammer, and come back... I guess it's possible, time-wise...)\nEdgeworth:\n...Manella:\nBut it was only 15 minutes! 15! That's only 13 in Base 12!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat were you doing for those 15 minutes?\nManella:\nEating my t-bone steak! What else!?\nPhoenix:\nThere were two plates on the trailer table...?\nManella:\nOh, right. The other one was Diva's... sorry, Dee Vasquez's plate.\nPhoenix:\n(Dee Vasquez... the producer.)\nEdgeworth:\nTo eat a t-bone steak in 15 minutes... that's quite a feat.Manella:\nNot enough time for someone to, say, commit murder in Studio One! LOL!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy is that?Press (after pressing first statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Why is that?\"Manella:\nThat's only just enough time to eat a t-bone steak, if you ask me! *steams*Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nI have to say, you look like a guy who gets through his meals pretty fast.\nManella:\nWell, I was facing a cold, slightly chewy t-bone steak... Even I have to take my time eating that kind of food. LOLMia:\nWell, Phoenix?Phoenix:\nThat testimony was too short to wring any kind of useful information out of!Mia:\nAll you have to do is prove that he was able to go to Studio One in that time!Phoenix:\n(Oh, great. Is that all...)Phoenix:\nWhy is that?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nHaven't we had enough of this pointless line of questioning? Your Honor! The testimony to this point has made one certain fact painfully clear: The people in the trailer had nothing to do with this murder! It was impossible for any of them to go to Studio One!Phoenix:\nWhat!?Edgeworth:\nSomething wrong, Mr. Wright? Surely you aren't suggesting one of the people in the trailer went to Studio One!Judge:\nHmm... Well, Mr. Wright?Mia:\nPhoenix, this is critical! Think about it before you give your answer!Judge:\nDo you claim someone from the trailer went to Studio One?I claim it, and claim it loud\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If I agree to let everyone in that trailer off the hook then the trial is over... Mr. Powers will be found guilty for sure!) The victim was murdered at 2:30, the exact time of the break in the meeting. With 15 minutes, murder is certainly a possibility!\nJudge:\nHmm... I suppose you might say that...\nPhoenix:\n(Alright, I've got the judge thinking now!)\nEdgeworth:\nTsk, tsk, tsk... Never a dull moment with you, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nWhat's your point, Edgeworth!\nEdgeworth:\nYou've been doing your homework, haven't you? Look at the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\nThe Court Record...?\nEdgeworth:\nSurely, you knew that from 2:15 to 4:00 the path between the studios was blocked? Mrs. Monkey's head had fallen across the path!\nPhoenix:\nWhoa! You're right!\nEdgeworth:\nTrue, the break in the trailer meeting came right at the time of death... However! The path from there to the scene of the crime was blocked! The fallen Mrs. Monkey head barred the way!\nPhoenix:\n... (It's actually \"Mr. Monkey,\" but Edgeworth has a point... And somehow, I feel no desire to correct him.)\nJudge:\nNo counter-argument, Mr. Wright? Then I'm afraid you lose this round.\nLeads to:\n\"I believe we have seen enough evidence.\"No, it's impossible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I don't want to write off so many possible suspects... But I can't keep claiming the impossible, either...) I agree that it was impossible for anyone in the trailer to go to the studio in that time.\nEdgeworth:\nHa hah! I thought you might be thoughtlessly treading on thin ice again! But I see you had at least an inkling of the truth.\nJudge:\nWhat do you mean, Mr. Edgeworth?\nEdgeworth:\nIt's quite simple... True, the break in the trailer meeting came right at the time of death... However! The path from there to the scene of the crime was blocked! The fallen Mrs. Monkey head barred the way! At around 2:15, a strong gust of wind knocked off the studio mascot's head. Ergo! When the people in the trailer took a break at 2:30, the way to the studio was blocked. Blocked... by Mrs. Monkey's severed head!\nPhoenix:\n... (It's actually \"Mr. Monkey,\" but Edgeworth has a point... And somehow, I feel no desire to correct him.)\nLeads to:\n\"I believe we have seen enough evidence.\"Edgeworth:\nI believe we have seen enough evidence. I would like to relieve Mr. Manella from the stand.Phoenix:\n(Wh-what? It's over?)Judge:\nVery well. The court's opinion on this case is as follows: We have found that there were several other people in Studio 2 on the day of the murder. However, it is also clear that none of these people could have gone to Studio One. They therefore have no relation to this case. Furthermore, with regards to the photo of the Steel Samurai... Given the size of the costume, no one other than Mr. Powers could have worn it that day. All that is lacking is decisive evidence that he is the one who did it. If we had that, I'm afraid I would have to find Mr. Powers guilty.Edgeworth:\nYour Honor. The prosecution is pleased to announce that we indeed have decisive evidence: a witness.Judge:\nWho is this witness, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:\nMy witness saw the very moment when the Steel Samurai skewered the victim!Judge:\nOrder! I will have order! I see. The court will take a 10 minute recess, after which we will hear your witness. Court is adjourned for recess!October 19, 11:04 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Mia:\n...Phoenix:\nWhat do we do now, Mia? If everyone in that trailer has an alibi...Mia:\n... I'm sorry, Phoenix. I guess I was wrong.Phoenix:\nM-Mia! Don't tell me you're giving up! If you give up, what hope do I have...?Mia:\n... Don't get me wrong. I've never given up on a trial before, not while there was a chance. Only one thing became clear in your cross-examination. The people in the trailer could not have gone to Studio One. I thought there was more to it than that... But I was wrong. That's all there is.Will:\nUmm... Er... What's going to happen to me? It kinda seems like everyone in that courtroom thinks I did it... They think I'm a murderer!Mia:\nDon't worry, Mr. Powers. If you are innocent, we will prove it. I guarantee it. Leave it to us, and... be yourself. Be strong. You are the Steel Samurai, hero to children everywhere, after all.Will:\nI... You... Thanks. *sniff*Mia:\nOkay, Phoenix. This one's for the kids! Let's do it!October 19, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:\nCourt is back in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution has a concern. As our witness is a grade schooler of tender years, and this is a murder case... we worry that the defense might cause unnecessary trauma with his cruel questioning. (Changed from [We worry that the defense might cause unnecessary trauma with his cruel questioning!] in the original release)Phoenix:\n(Nice to see Edgeworth taking the moral high ground...)Edgeworth:\nHowever, we have no choice. The prosecution calls Cody Hackins to the stand.Edgeworth:\nYour Honor. Perhaps you could arrange a box for him to stand on?Judge:\nOh, r-right. Guard, please bring him a box. One of those donut crates should do.Edgeworth:\nWill the witness state his name and grade in school.Cody:\n...Edgeworth:\nWitness!Cody:\nWhat!? Just 'cause you're all grown-up don't mean you can push me around!Edgeworth:\nMrph...Mia:\nCody? Answer his question, okay?Cody:\nH-hey, it's you! The nice lady! I'm Cody Hackins. I'm in 2nd grade!Phoenix:\n(I get the feeling this is going to be a long, long day...)Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth. Please remember that you're speaking to a child. Try to be gentle.Edgeworth:\nM-mrrrrph! Witness! Er, I mean, Cody.Phoenix:\n(He's having trouble with this \"gentle\" thing.)Edgeworth:\nYou were present, er, you were at Global Studios on the day of the, er, incident?Cody:\nYou got a problem with that!?Edgeworth:\nPlease tell us what you saw that day.Cody:\nWhat, pops? You want me to tell you and gramps with the beard over there?Edgeworth:\nJust.. Mr. Edgeworth will be fine.Judge:\nI prefer \"bearded gentleman\" myself.Phoenix:\n(A very long day...)Judge:\nIncidentally, photographic equipment is strictly forbidden in this courtroom.Edgeworth:\nM-mpht! M-my apologies, Your Honor. He said he wouldn't testify if he couldn't bring it... I'd like special permission, if that's possible.Phoenix:\nWait, so you're saying you had to bargain terms with a kid... and you LOST?Cody:\nHey! I just got this new camera! Don't really know how to use it all that good yet! But I bring it with me wherever I go!Mia:\nPhoenix. I wonder if he had that camera on the day of the murder... You'd better make a note of it in the Court Record.Cody's Camera added to the Court Record.Judge:\nVery well, Cody. Please testify to the court about what you saw the day of the incident.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Cody:\nI wanted to see a Steel Samurai rehearsal, just once.\nI found a map on the Internet, and went to the studios that day.\nI went through the woods off the path, so that old lady wouldn't catch me.\nI was going for the studio.\nI got kinda lost on the way, though. For about 30 minutes.\nWhen I came out by the studio, there was the Steel Samurai!\nIt totally rocked! Right before my eyes, out came the bad guy!\nOf course, the Steel Samurai took him down! Pow!\nIf I had my camera with me, that woulda been the time for a shot, I tell you.\nAnyway, I couldn't get into the studio, so I went home.Judge:\nHmm... Very well. The defense may begin its cross-examination. But be gentle. Remember you're talking to a child. (Changed from [And, be gentle. Remember you're talking to a child.] in the original release)Cody:\n...Phoenix:\n(This kid is tougher than most adults we see in here, honestly...)Cross Examination-- Witness's Account --Cody:\nI wanted to see a Steel Samurai rehearsal, just once.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou really like the Steel Samurai, huh?\nCody:\nCourse I do! I've taped every show! And I go to all the live performances!\nPhoenix:\nThat's impressive. Have you been to the amusement park?\nCody:\nCourse! Duh! My Dad always takes me!\nPhoenix:\n(Poor, poor Dad...)Cody:\nI found a map on the Internet, and went to the studios that day.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWas that day the first time you'd been to the studio?\nCody:\nUh, actually I've been a couple of times. I never manage to get there on a rehearsal day! And that security lady's always yelling...\nEdgeworth:\nRight, right. Please continue.\nCody:\nChill, pops! I'm getting to it! How am I supposed to talk with you cuttin' me off all the time? Geez!\nEdgeworth:\n...Cody:\nI went through the woods, off the path, so that old lady wouldn't catch me.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Off the path\"...?\nCody:\nYeah, you know how the studios are in a valley there? If you go off the path a little, there's woods. That's where I was!\nPhoenix:\nI see.\nCody:\nAnyhow...Cody:\nI was going for the studio.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid nothing unusual happen on your way to the studio?\nCody:\n\"Unusual\"?\nPhoenix:\nDid you see this monkey by any chance?\nCody:\nOh, you mean Mr. Monkey? Yeah I saw him, but his head wasn't busted!\nEdgeworth:\nSo you went straight to the studio?Cody:\nI got kinda lost on the way, though. For about 30 minutes.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou got lost in the woods?\nCody:\nYeah. I couldn't figure out which way I was walking. Man, was I relieved when I saw the blue studio doors. But guess what happened next!Cody:\nWhen I came out by the studio, there was the Steel Samurai!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe Steel Samurai?\nCody:\nYeah, he was standing by the studio gate. It looked like he was thinking about something before going in. Then he opened up the gate and went inside.\nPhoenix:\nI see. What then?Cody:\nIt totally rocked! Right before my eyes, out came the bad guy!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat sort of \"bad guy\" was it?\nCody:\nA guy. A person. Kinda tall. Skinny.\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure it was a guy?\nCody:\n... I dunno. He was kinda far away.\nPhoenix:\n(Huh, he's being awfully vague...)\nMia:\n...Cody:\nOf course, the Steel Samurai took him down! Pow!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat happened to the bad guy?\nCody:\nHuh? Well... Well, he kinda didn't move. Not a bit. Like he was dead. I-I guess he's a real pro! What a great actor!\nPhoenix:\nY-yes, I suppose he was.Cody:\nIf I had my camera with me, that woulda been the time for a shot, I tell you.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"If\" you had your camera? You mean, you weren't carrying your camera then?\nCody:\nN-no, I wasn't. I-it's not like I have it all the time!\nPhoenix:\n(Really...?)Present Cody's Camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Cody, what you just said seems, well, a little strange.\"Phoenix:\n(I guess seeing the killing freaked him out and he went home...)Mia:\nPhoenix. Remember, he's a child. Use gentle words... but be firm.Phoenix:\n(Easy for you to say...)Phoenix:\nCody, what you just said seems, well, a little strange. Didn't you say before that you always bring your digital camera wherever you go? You were quite clear about that.Cody:\nHuh!?Phoenix:\nCody, you shouldn't lie here. You understand that, right?Judge:\nMr. Wright! A word with you...Phoenix:\n(Uh oh... was I putting the pressure on too much?)Judge:\nWhat is this \"digital\" camera contraption you're talking about?Phoenix:\nIt's umm... a digital camera, Your Honor. It's kind of a new sort of camera. (How do I explain that!?)Judge:\nI see.Phoenix:\nAnyway, Cody... I can't believe you wouldn't bring your camera on a trip to the studios! You did bring it, didn't you?Cody:\nUmm...Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nMr. Wright! How cruel you are, to terrorize a poor child so!Phoenix:\nI don't care if he's a child or a prosecuting attorney! No one should lie in court!Edgeworth:\nWhat do you mean \"or a prosecuting attorney\"!?Phoenix:\nWell, Cody?Cody:\nWh-what! Yeah, so I had my camera. So what!? You got a problem with that!?Judge:\nSo, you did have a camera? And did you use this camera?Cody:\nW-why would I use it? I... I was too busy watching.Judge:\nHmm... Very well. Please testify to the court about what you were so busy watching.Witness Testimony-- What I Saw --Cody:\nY-yeah, I had my camera with me.\nBut I was glued to the action! I couldn't take my eyes off it!\nThe Steel Samurai, he goes for the bad guy... wham!\nThen... then the bad guy stopped moving!\nHe's so strong! The Steel Samurai rules!Judge:\nHmm... Ah? Is that all? Well, that was brief. Mr. Wright, your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- What I Saw --Cody:\nY-yeah, I had my camera with me.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, why didn't you use it?\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nHe's getting to that! Relax and listen.\nCody:\nUmm... I didn't use it 'cause I was too busy watching the real thing!Cody:\nBut I was glued to the action! I couldn't take my eyes off it!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you were watching the Steel Samurai. Did you watch the whole fight?\nCody:\nY-yeah, of course!\nPhoenix:\nYou didn't turn away, not even once?\nCody:\nN... no!\nPhoenix:\nOkay, then tell us exactly what happened.\nCody:\nY-yeah! I'm getting to that!Cody:\nThe Steel Samurai, he goes for the bad guy... wham!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo the bad guy attacked him first?\nCody:\nYeah!\nPhoenix:\nWhat sort of person was this \"bad guy\"?\nCody:\nI told you, a person. He was a person.\nPhoenix:\nHow was he dressed?\nCody:\n... I kinda don't remember. I was too busy watching the Steel Samurai!\nEdgeworth:\nI see. And what happened next?Cody:\nThen... then the bad guy stopped moving!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy?\nCody:\nHuh? Whaddya mean, \"why\"?\nPhoenix:\nWhy wasn't the bad guy moving?\nCody:\nW-well 'cause the Steel Samurai brought him to justice!\nPhoenix:\nAnd how exactly did he do that?\nCody:\nH-how did he do it? With a Samurai Kick! And a Samurai Punch! Samurai Chop! ... Samurai Slap! S-something like that.\nPhoenix:\n(He's still being vague about this...)\nCody:\nWhat! Don't gimme that look, pops!\nPhoenix:\n(How should I play this?)\n\n\n\nWait and see what happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah... If I press too hard now, the judge might keep me from continuing. I'll sit back and see how the rest of this goes.)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress him harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Cody.\"Cody:\nHe's so strong! The Steel Samurai rules!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat did you do after the bad guy fell, Cody?\nCody:\n... Um, actually... The fight was so... so intense that I got kinda scared. So I went straight home.\nPhoenix:\n(Something isn't adding up here...)Phoenix:\n(Something about his account doesn't seem right...)Mia:\nPhoenix. It doesn't seem right because he's being deliberately vague! Press him on the facts, Phoenix! Find out what he saw!Phoenix:\nCody.Cody:\nWh-what!?Phoenix:\nSomething's bothering me. Before you said that you \"couldn't take your eyes off\" the action.Cody:\nY-yeah? So what?Phoenix:\nYet you missed the most important part!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nWhat is the meaning of this? The witness has stated what he saw quite clearly...Phoenix:Phoenix:\nYou know as well as I do that he's being vague! Tell me, what kind of murderer uses a \"Samurai Slap\"!?Edgeworth:\nM-mmph!Phoenix:\nMy point is this: Cody, you may have seen some of the Steel Samurai's fight... But you missed the most important part: the killing blow!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Mr. Wright! How could this be? Can you explain how he might have missed something so vital?Phoenix:\nUm, well... er, that's the thing...Mia:\nPhoenix! I believe you're on the right track with this! Think: why didn't Cody see the climax of the fight? I know you! You can figure this out!Judge:\nMr. Wright, your answer! We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai... Why wouldn't he watch the climax of the fight?He couldn't watch it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nBecause he couldn't watch it! How could he calmly watch a murder taking place at his age!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nJust a moment, please... One thing has become quite clear in this boy's testimony. He did not believe he was witnessing a murder! He was watching the Steel Samurai fight, like on TV. The more real the fight, the more he would have watched!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... huh.\nJudge:\nI have to agree with Mr. Edgeworth. Well, Mr. Wright. Do you have another explanation?\nLeads back to:\n\"We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai...\"He was watching something else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHe missed the climax of the fight... because he was looking at something else! Probably!\nEdgeworth:\n\"Probably\"?\nJudge:\n\"Something else\"?\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Wright, explain yourself! What could possibly distract this boy from seeing his idol, the Steel Samurai, fight!? What do you claim he was looking at?\nPhoenix:\nO-ooof! (C'mon, think of something... think of something... Nothing.)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Please refrain from making baseless claims!\nPhoenix:\nY-yes... Sorry, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nDo you have another explanation for this?\nLeads back to:\n\"We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai...\"Show evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor, I have evidence.\nJudge:\n\"Evidence\"...?\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. Why did Cody look away from the fight?\n\n\n\nPresent Cody's Camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Here's my proof!\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHere's my proof!\nJudge:\nProof?\nPhoenix:\nUm, uh... Can I... do that again? (This doesn't prove anything...!)\nEdgeworth:\nHah! Lost your nerve, have you?\nJudge:\nVery well... I'll ask you the question again.\nLeads back to:\n\"We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai...\"Phoenix:\nHere's my proof!Judge:\nWhat's that? The camera...?Phoenix:\nThe witness stated that he recently received this camera.Judge:\nYes, I'm aware of that.Phoenix:\nHe wasn't entirely familiar with its operation.Judge:\nI'm aware of that, too. Ah!Phoenix:\nCorrect! Why would Cody be looking somewhere else at the critical moment? Because he was looking at his camera! He was trying to take a picture!Cody:\nHey!Phoenix:\nBullseye!Cody:\nW-what's your problem, pops! You got a thing for picking on little kids!?Phoenix:\n(Pressing, not picking...)Mia:\nGood job, Phoenix! Cody was lying, clearly. Smart of you to realize there was no way he could just stand there, watching his hero... and not take a picture!Phoenix:\nRight! Cody? There was only one reason why you would have looked away from the fight. And that was because you wanted to take a picture. But having just received your camera, you weren't used to using it yet! So, you missed the climax of the fight. Correct?Cody:\n... ... ... Yeah.Mia:\nWell, Phoenix. I'll bet you anything he's hiding more than that. Have him testify again!Phoenix:\nR-right. (Mia means business!) Your Honor. The defense would like to request that Cody Hackins testify once more.Judge:\nV-very well. Cody? Could you please tell us about your camera... And about why you didn't take a picture of the fight?Cody:\nUmm...Phoenix:\n(Welcome to the real world, kid!)Witness Testimony-- No Photo? --Cody:\nYeah, you're right, pops.\nThe Steel Samurai had just escaped from the clutches of the villain.\nSo I held up my camera to take a picture!\nBut the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it.\nTh-that's all that happened. Yup.Judge:\nHmm... Anything strange in that testimony, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nI'm not sure... But I'd like to proceed with the cross-examination anyway.Cross Examination",

Relax and listen.\nCody:\nUmm... I didn't use it 'cause I was too busy watching the real thing!Cody:\nBut I was glued to the action! I couldn't take my eyes off it!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you were watching the Steel Samurai. Did you watch the whole fight?\nCody:\nY-yeah, of course!\nPhoenix:\nYou didn't turn away, not even once?\nCody:\nN... no!\nPhoenix:\nOkay, then tell us exactly what happened.\nCody:\nY-yeah! I'm getting to that!Cody:\nThe Steel Samurai, he goes for the bad guy... wham!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo the bad guy attacked him first?\nCody:\nYeah!\nPhoenix:\nWhat sort of person was this \"bad guy\"?\nCody:\nI told you, a person. He was a person.\nPhoenix:\nHow was he dressed?\nCody:\n... I kinda don't remember. I was too busy watching the Steel Samurai!\nEdgeworth:\nI see. And what happened next?Cody:\nThen... then the bad guy stopped moving!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy?\nCody:\nHuh? Whaddya mean, \"why\"?\nPhoenix:\nWhy wasn't the bad guy moving?\nCody:\nW-well 'cause the Steel Samurai brought him to justice!\nPhoenix:\nAnd how exactly did he do that?\nCody:\nH-how did he do it? With a Samurai Kick! And a Samurai Punch! Samurai Chop! ... Samurai Slap! S-something like that.\nPhoenix:\n(He's still being vague about this...)\nCody:\nWhat! Don't gimme that look, pops!\nPhoenix:\n(How should I play this?)\n\n\n\nWait and see what happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah... If I press too hard now, the judge might keep me from continuing. I'll sit back and see how the rest of this goes.)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress him harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Cody.\"Cody:\nHe's so strong! The Steel Samurai rules!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat did you do after the bad guy fell, Cody?\nCody:\n... Um, actually... The fight was so... so intense that I got kinda scared. So I went straight home.\nPhoenix:\n(Something isn't adding up here...)Phoenix:\n(Something about his account doesn't seem right...)Mia:\nPhoenix. It doesn't seem right because he's being deliberately vague! Press him on the facts, Phoenix! Find out what he saw!Phoenix:\nCody.Cody:\nWh-what!?Phoenix:\nSomething's bothering me. Before you said that you \"couldn't take your eyes off\" the action.Cody:\nY-yeah? So what?Phoenix:\nYet you missed the most important part!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nWhat is the meaning of this? The witness has stated what he saw quite clearly...Phoenix:Phoenix:\nYou know as well as I do that he's being vague! Tell me, what kind of murderer uses a \"Samurai Slap\"!?Edgeworth:\nM-mmph!Phoenix:\nMy point is this: Cody, you may have seen some of the Steel Samurai's fight... But you missed the most important part: the killing blow!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Mr. Wright! How could this be? Can you explain how he might have missed something so vital?Phoenix:\nUm, well... er, that's the thing...Mia:\nPhoenix! I believe you're on the right track with this! Think: why didn't Cody see the climax of the fight? I know you! You can figure this out!Judge:\nMr. Wright, your answer! We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai... Why wouldn't he watch the climax of the fight?He couldn't watch it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nBecause he couldn't watch it! How could he calmly watch a murder taking place at his age!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nJust a moment, please... One thing has become quite clear in this boy's testimony. He did not believe he was witnessing a murder! He was watching the Steel Samurai fight, like on TV. The more real the fight, the more he would have watched!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... huh.\nJudge:\nI have to agree with Mr. Edgeworth. Well, Mr. Wright. Do you have another explanation?\nLeads back to:\n\"We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai...\"He was watching something else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHe missed the climax of the fight... because he was looking at something else! Probably!\nEdgeworth:\n\"Probably\"?\nJudge:\n\"Something else\"?\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Wright, explain yourself! What could possibly distract this boy from seeing his idol, the Steel Samurai, fight!? What do you claim he was looking at?\nPhoenix:\nO-ooof! (C'mon, think of something... think of something... Nothing.)\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Please refrain from making baseless claims!\nPhoenix:\nY-yes... Sorry, Your Honor.\nJudge:\nDo you have another explanation for this?\nLeads back to:\n\"We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai...\"Show evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor, I have evidence.\nJudge:\n\"Evidence\"...?\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. Why did Cody look away from the fight?\n\n\n\nPresent Cody's Camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Here's my proof!\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHere's my proof!\nJudge:\nProof?\nPhoenix:\nUm, uh... Can I... do that again? (This doesn't prove anything...!)\nEdgeworth:\nHah! Lost your nerve, have you?\nJudge:\nVery well... I'll ask you the question again.\nLeads back to:\n\"We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai...\"Phoenix:\nHere's my proof!Judge:\nWhat's that? The camera...?Phoenix:\nThe witness stated that he recently received this camera.Judge:\nYes, I'm aware of that.Phoenix:\nHe wasn't entirely familiar with its operation.Judge:\nI'm aware of that, too. Ah!Phoenix:\nCorrect! Why would Cody be looking somewhere else at the critical moment? Because he was looking at his camera! He was trying to take a picture!Cody:\nHey!Phoenix:\nBullseye!Cody:\nW-what's your problem, pops! You got a thing for picking on little kids!?Phoenix:\n(Pressing, not picking...)Mia:\nGood job, Phoenix! Cody was lying, clearly. Smart of you to realize there was no way he could just stand there, watching his hero... and not take a picture!Phoenix:\nRight! Cody? There was only one reason why you would have looked away from the fight. And that was because you wanted to take a picture. But having just received your camera, you weren't used to using it yet! So, you missed the climax of the fight. Correct?Cody:\n... ... ... Yeah.Mia:\nWell, Phoenix. I'll bet you anything he's hiding more than that. Have him testify again!Phoenix:\nR-right. (Mia means business!) Your Honor. The defense would like to request that Cody Hackins testify once more.Judge:\nV-very well. Cody? Could you please tell us about your camera... And about why you didn't take a picture of the fight?Cody:\nUmm...Phoenix:\n(Welcome to the real world, kid!)Witness Testimony-- No Photo? --Cody:\nYeah, you're right, pops.\nThe Steel Samurai had just escaped from the clutches of the villain.\nSo I held up my camera to take a picture!\nBut the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it.\nTh-that's all that happened. Yup.Judge:\nHmm... Anything strange in that testimony, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nI'm not sure... But I'd like to proceed with the cross-examination anyway.Cross Examination",

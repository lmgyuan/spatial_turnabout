Why did I do that...?That girl... You shouldn't see her anymore.Hey! It's none of your business!I'm telling you for your sake. If you continue to see her, it's going to be bad news.Y-You're lying!Just listen to me. There's something you need to know about that girl... ...Stop it! D-Don't talk about her like that!It-It wasn't me! I-I d-didn't... I didn't do it!-- Five Years Earlier --Mia FeySecond TrialApril 11, 9:40 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3Mia:\n(Whew, it's finally time... I'm kind of nervous...)???:\n*Ah-HHHHEM!*Mia:\nOh! Mr. Grossberg! Good morning!Grossberg:\nAh, Mia. Please calm yourself down! You're going to get yourself arrested for suspicious behavior, you know.Mia:\nWhat are you talking about!! I am relaxed, Mr. Grossberg!! Look at me, I'm relaxed!!Grossberg:\n*Grrrmmphh* L-Let go of my lapels! Hmph... You obviously haven't got the temperament to be a lawyer.Mia:\nI, err... I'm so sorry! It's just that I'm so nervous today...Grossberg:\nOh, that's right. This is your first time in the big leagues, isn't it? Well, never you fear my dear. I, Marvin Grossberg, am at your service!Mia:\nUmm, actually this is my second time in court...Grossberg:\nStill, you surprised me... What, with your earnest request last night... \"Let me handle this case!\" you suddenly said. And quite forcefully, too!Mia:\nI just found out yesterday. About the case, I mean.Grossberg:\nWhat? And you've already learned all the relevant facts?Mia:\nWell about that... You see... I mean, of course I have! I think.Grossberg:\nOh dear... In any case, don't let our client see you're so nervous. You see the poor young man in the pink sweater over there? That's our client.Phoenix:\n*cough* *sniffle* Good morning there everybody!Mia:\nGood morning... (Try to keep smiling, Mia!)Phoenix:\nI, err, I just want to say... I'll give it all I've got! Yup, it'll be fine! No prob! *cough* *achoo* *achoo*Mia:\nOh, what's wrong? Do you have a cold or something... Mr. Wry?Phoenix:\nActually, it's Wright... Like the flying brothers... People screw it up all the time. And yes I have a cold. That's what this mask is for. My doc says this way, I won't give it to anyone else... Be kind to others, he says...Mia:\nRight, Mr. Wright! You have nothing to fear in court today! If you are truly innocent... I promise I will save you!Phoenix:\nNnnnggghh... P-Please l-let go of my shirt... *cough*Mia:\n(That's right, he's the one on trial, not you! He's the one who should be nervous! You need to stay strong for your client, Mia!)Mia:\nMy name is Mia Fey. I'm still pretty new at this lawyer thing... The first time I appeared in court was a year ago. But that trial traumatized me so badly, I thought I'd never set foot in another courtroom. It's been one year since then, and well, here I am again. But this time... This time I'm going to win. (Changed from [But this time... This time I'll win.] in the original release) For my client... And for myself.April 11, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Phoenix Wright.Mia:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor!Payne:\nThe prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Judge:\nThe defense today is... Ms... Ms... Mia Fey, was it?Mia:\nY-Yes, Your Honor. Is there a problem?Judge:\nI was under the impression that Marvin Grossberg was to be leading the defense.Mia:\nYes! Well, you see... Mr. Grossberg had... A-A bit of an emergency...Judge:\nEmergency? But isn't that him standing there right next to you?Mia:\nYes, well...Judge:\nYou... You're just a rookie. Are you sure you can really handle this?Mia:\n(Don't let him scare you, Mia! Give him your toughest look!) Of course, Your Honor! ... I think.Judge:\nHmm... Well, Mr. Payne. Your opening statement, please.Payne:\nWell, well, well... I can't believe a veteran like me has to spend his time baby-sitting a new defense lawyer.Mia:\n...!Payne:\nDon't worry little girl. It will all be over soon.Mia:\n(What was that all about? Was he trying to trash-talk me?)Payne:\nNow then, I'd like to proceed with a summary of events on the day in question. The incident occurred on the campus of Ivy University. The murder victim was a student named Doug Swallow. He was a fourth year student studying Pharmacology.Judge:\nHmm... It sounds like he was a very bright young man.Payne:\nYes, well, next we have a photo taken at the scene of the crime. Students discovered the scene shortly after the murder. They found the victim's body... ...and the defendant, who had obviously bungled his getaway. They then called the police.Judge:\nHmm... That certainly makes the defendant look very suspicious indeed. Very well. The court accepts this photo into the record as evidence.Crime Photo 1 added to the Court Record.Judge:\nBy the way... I can't quite tell the cause of death from this photo.Payne:\nHee, hee, hee... Your reputation for sagacity is well-earned, Your Honor. The truth is that this victim died a rather unusual death.Mia:\nAn unusual death...!?Judge:\nWhat do you mean, Mr. Payne!?Payne:\nWell... Perhaps the defense would like to take this question.Mia:\nHuh...!?Payne:\nA simple question. I thought I might loosen you up a bit. I am a genteel-man, if you will.Mia:\nUm, a what? (Stand up to him, Mia! Show him what you're made of!)Grossberg:\nAh, a perfect opportunity! Well, what was it? The cause! Go on! ... ...Please say you know at least this much.Mia:\nI-I'm so sorry... I-I didn't get a chance to read through the whole file.Grossberg:\n*groan* My hemorrhoids are beginning to act up... Now see here! The details of the case are filed under the Court Record. But you knew that already, didn't you?Mia:\n(Ah! The Court Record! I think I can see that by pressing [the R Button / Tab]...) (Changed from [Ah! The Court Record! I think I can see that by touching the Court Record Button...] in the original release)Grossberg:\nAll of the weapons we need can be found in the Court Record. Take a good, hard look at the data there and think carefully before you answer, m'dear!Mia:\nY-Yes, sir! I'll do just that! (I've got to stay calm! I can't let that prosecutor get the better of me! The Court Record... OK, let's take a look! I just press [the R Button / Tab] here... (Changed from [The Court Record... OK, let's take a look! I just touch the Court Record Button here...] in the original release))Judge:\nNow then, would the attorney for the defense please answer the question? What was the cause of death?Asphyxiation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nWell... I think you'll find it was a case of asphyxiation.\nJudge:\nHmm... Asphyxiation, huh?\nGrossberg:\nM-Mia! What are you doing!? (Changed from [M-Mia! What are you saying!?] in the original release)\nMia:\nWell, it's stuffy in here! I can hardly breathe.\nGrossberg:\nNo one's asking how you feel! Please, make sure to properly read the Court Record!\nMia:\nI-I'm so sorry! I'll take a better look! (Hang in there, Mia! Okay! The Court Record is [the R Button / Tab]...) (Changed from [Hang in there, Mia! Open the Court Record with the Court Record Button...] in the original release)\nJudge:\nHmm... I'll ask you once again.\nLeads back to:\n\"What was the cause of death?\"Electrocution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"According to the Court Record, it was a fatal electric shock. In other words, electrocution.\"Hypothermia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nErr... Hypothermia, I believe.\n... ... ......\nMia:\nUmm, Mr. Grossberg? Does it suddenly feel very cold in here to you?\nGrossberg:\nThat's because your absurd reply has brought a chill to the courtroom!\nMia:\nI-I'm so sorry...\nGrossberg:\nLook at the Court Record more carefully, would you! How can you expect to win a case this way!?\nMia:\n(Hang in there, Mia! Okay! The Court Record is [the R Button / Tab]...) (Changed from [Hang in there, Mia! Open the Court Record with the Court Record Button...] in the original release)\nJudge:\nHmm... I'll ask you once again.\nLeads back to:\n\"What was the cause of death?\"Mia:\nAccording to the Court Record, it was a fatal electric shock. In other words, electrocution.Judge:\nElectrocution? Hmm... But how could such a thing happen? Did the murderer use some type of new, super-powerful stun-gun, perhaps?Payne:\nThe answer to that will become crystal clear as this trial proceeds, Your Honor. But before that, there is one more vital issue.Mia:\nWh-What's that?Payne:\nWhy, motive of course. Apparently there was some bad blood between the victim and the defendant.Judge:\nBad blood...?Mia:\nWh-What do you mean...?Payne:\nOopsie! I'm terribly sorry. You're the defense attorney, so you must know all about it. I shouldn't be stealing your spotlight like this.Mia:\n(I really don't like this guy's smug attitude...)Grossberg:\nThat's Winston Payne for you. He is one smooth operator, if you catch my drift. They don't call him the \"Rookie Killer\" for nothing, you know.Judge:\nNow then, let's hear from the defense. What was the source of the bad blood between the victim and the defendant? And this time, I would like to see some supporting evidence!Mia:\nEv-Evidence...?Grossberg:\nAh, no need to get all worked up over this. As I said, all our weapons can be found in the Court Record. Find the evidence you need and then shove it into Ol' Graybeard's face!Mia:\nY-Yes, sir! Into Ol' Graybeard's face!Judge:\nErr, Mr. Grossberg. Try to set a better example for the young lady!Grossberg:\nMia, evidence isn't the only thing in the Court Record. People's profiles are as well. You can toggle between Profiles and Evidence with [the R Button / Tab], so be sure to go over it all! (Changed from [You can toggle between Profiles and Evidence, so be sure to go over it all!] in the original release)Judge:\nNow then, let's see what you've got. What was the cause of the bad blood between Phoenix Wright and the victim?Present Dahlia Hawthorne profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The reason for the bad blood between the two of them was... this woman here.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nJudge:\nMr. Grossberg... I honestly think it would be best for the defense if you were in charge. I'm afraid Ms. Fey might stir up some bad blood with this court if she were to continue.\nGrossberg:\nOr simply put, you are quite mistaken, m'dear.\nMia:\nOh no... I'm so sorry...\nJudge:\nEven if you are new, your lack of preparation is inexcusable. Now take a moment and think it over again.\nMia:\nY-Yes, Your Honor! (It's OK! You've got another chance, Mia!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Mia, evidence isn't the only thing in the Court Record.\"Mia:\nThe reason for the bad blood between the two of them was... this woman here.Judge:\nDahlia Hawthorne, is it?Payne:\nVery good, Ms. Fey. You seem to have picked up on at least this much. This woman is the girlfriend of the defendant, Phoenix Wright. But up until about eight months ago, she was with the victim, Mr. Swallow. Clearly she has some part to play in this story.Judge:\nHmm...Grossberg:\nAh, he's done it again. Before the cross-examination starts, he's already got the judge thinking like he wants.Judge:\nVery well, Mr. Payne. Please call your first witness!Payne:\nIf it pleases the court, the prosecution would like to call Mr. Phoenix Wright.Judge:\nWhat? The defendant himself? Well, Ms. Fey?Mia:\n(It's fine! After all, Mr. Wright is innocent, right?) The defense has no objection.Judge:\nVery well. The court calls Mr. Phoenix Wright to the witness stand!Payne:\nWitness, please state your name and occupation.Phoenix:\nOh, ah, yes... My name is Phoenix Wright. My job is, um... Well, right now, I guess I'm a suspect.Judge:\nNo, no. He means what did you do before you were arrested?Phoenix:\nOh... *achoo* *achoo* *achoo* I was a university student.Payne:\nMr. Wright. You understand that you are suspected in the death of your fellow student, Doug Swa--Phoenix:\nBut! But I didn't do it! I'm innocent I tell you! I'm telling you I was... *achoo* *achoo* *cough* *cough* *achoo* *cough*Judge:\nWould the defendant please refrain from passing on his cold to the rest of us!Payne:\nIt seems the witness has something he wants to say.Judge:\nHmm... Well then, Mr. Wright. Please tell us about your relation to the victim.Phoenix:\nRight away, Your Honor!Witness Testimony-- The Victim and I --Phoenix:\nUm, I... I admit I was there...\nBut I'm not a killer! All I did was find his body!\nI hardly knew the guy to begin with...\nI never even talked to that stuck-up British wannabe!Judge:\nHmm... I see. So you hardly knew the victim?Phoenix:\nRight! Like I said, I'm not a killer!Mia:\nWhew... It looks like the judge understands.Grossberg:\nMmfph... You're being na\u00efve, you know. Too na\u00efve.Mia:\nHuh...?Payne:\nHee, hee, hee, hee, hee. It seems that you've forgotten one small thing, young lady.Mia:\nAnd that would be...?Payne:\nThis witness still has to undergo something called cross-examination.Mia:\nCross-examination...?Grossberg:\nHe's right. And it's the defense's duty to carry out the cross-examination. The purpose is to determine if a witness's testimony contains any contradictions.Mia:\nContradictions...?Grossberg:\nIf a witness is lying, their statements will conflict with the Court Record.Mia:\nBut... Mr. Wright is my client!Grossberg:\nEven if he is your client, in court, all lies must be struck down. As a lawyer, that is your duty, you see.Mia:\n(What does he mean by that? Is he saying that testimony just now... That there was a lie -- a contradiction?)Judge:\nNow then, your cross-examination, if you please, Ms. Fey.Mia:\n(Please, Mr. Wright... Tell me you haven't been lying! You wouldn't do that to me... would you...?)Cross Examination",

Well, right now, I guess I'm a suspect.Judge:\nNo, no. He means what did you do before you were arrested?Phoenix:\nOh... *achoo* *achoo* *achoo* I was a university student.Payne:\nMr. Wright. You understand that you are suspected in the death of your fellow student, Doug Swa--Phoenix:\nBut! But I didn't do it! I'm innocent I tell you! I'm telling you I was... *achoo* *achoo* *cough* *cough* *achoo* *cough*Judge:\nWould the defendant please refrain from passing on his cold to the rest of us!Payne:\nIt seems the witness has something he wants to say.Judge:\nHmm... Well then, Mr. Wright. Please tell us about your relation to the victim.Phoenix:\nRight away, Your Honor!Witness Testimony-- The Victim and I --Phoenix:\nUm, I... I admit I was there...\nBut I'm not a killer! All I did was find his body!\nI hardly knew the guy to begin with...\nI never even talked to that stuck-up British wannabe!Judge:\nHmm... I see. So you hardly knew the victim?Phoenix:\nRight! Like I said, I'm not a killer!Mia:\nWhew... It looks like the judge understands.Grossberg:\nMmfph... You're being na\u00efve, you know. Too na\u00efve.Mia:\nHuh...?Payne:\nHee, hee, hee, hee, hee. It seems that you've forgotten one small thing, young lady.Mia:\nAnd that would be...?Payne:\nThis witness still has to undergo something called cross-examination.Mia:\nCross-examination...?Grossberg:\nHe's right. And it's the defense's duty to carry out the cross-examination. The purpose is to determine if a witness's testimony contains any contradictions.Mia:\nContradictions...?Grossberg:\nIf a witness is lying, their statements will conflict with the Court Record.Mia:\nBut... Mr. Wright is my client!Grossberg:\nEven if he is your client, in court, all lies must be struck down. As a lawyer, that is your duty, you see.Mia:\n(What does he mean by that? Is he saying that testimony just now... That there was a lie -- a contradiction?)Judge:\nNow then, your cross-examination, if you please, Ms. Fey.Mia:\n(Please, Mr. Wright... Tell me you haven't been lying! You wouldn't do that to me... would you...?)Cross Examination",

Why did I do that...?That girl... You shouldn't see her anymore.Hey! It's none of your business!I'm telling you for your sake. If you continue to see her, it's going to be bad news.Y-You're lying!Just listen to me. There's something you need to know about that girl... ...Stop it! D-Don't talk about her like that!It-It wasn't me! I-I d-didn't... I didn't do it!-- Five Years Earlier --Mia FeySecond TrialApril 11, 9:40 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3Mia:\n(Whew, it's finally time... I'm kind of nervous...)???:\n*Ah-HHHHEM!*Mia:\nOh! Mr. Grossberg! Good morning!Grossberg:\nAh, Mia. Please calm yourself down! You're going to get yourself arrested for suspicious behavior, you know.Mia:\nWhat are you talking about!! I am relaxed, Mr. Grossberg!! Look at me, I'm relaxed!!Grossberg:\n*Grrrmmphh* L-Let go of my lapels! Hmph... You obviously haven't got the temperament to be a lawyer.Mia:\nI, err... I'm so sorry! It's just that I'm so nervous today...Grossberg:\nOh, that's right. This is your first time in the big leagues, isn't it? Well, never you fear my dear. I, Marvin Grossberg, am at your service!Mia:\nUmm, actually this is my second time in court...Grossberg:\nStill, you surprised me... What, with your earnest request last night... \"Let me handle this case!\" you suddenly said. And quite forcefully, too!Mia:\nI just found out yesterday. About the case, I mean.Grossberg:\nWhat? And you've already learned all the relevant facts?Mia:\nWell about that... You see... I mean, of course I have! I think.Grossberg:\nOh dear... In any case, don't let our client see you're so nervous. You see the poor young man in the pink sweater over there? That's our client.Phoenix:\n*cough* *sniffle* Good morning there everybody!Mia:\nGood morning... (Try to keep smiling, Mia!)Phoenix:\nI, err, I just want to say... I'll give it all I've got! Yup, it'll be fine! No prob! *cough* *achoo* *achoo*Mia:\nOh, what's wrong? Do you have a cold or something... Mr. Wry?Phoenix:\nActually, it's Wright... Like the flying brothers... People screw it up all the time. And yes I have a cold. That's what this mask is for. My doc says this way, I won't give it to anyone else... Be kind to others, he says...Mia:\nRight, Mr. Wright! You have nothing to fear in court today! If you are truly innocent... I promise I will save you!Phoenix:\nNnnnggghh... P-Please l-let go of my shirt... *cough*Mia:\n(That's right, he's the one on trial, not you! He's the one who should be nervous! You need to stay strong for your client, Mia!)Mia:\nMy name is Mia Fey. I'm still pretty new at this lawyer thing... The first time I appeared in court was a year ago. But that trial traumatized me so badly, I thought I'd never set foot in another courtroom. It's been one year since then, and well, here I am again. But this time... This time I'm going to win. (Changed from [But this time... This time I'll win.] in the original release) For my client... And for myself.April 11, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Phoenix Wright.Mia:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor!Payne:\nThe prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Judge:\nThe defense today is... Ms... Ms... Mia Fey, was it?Mia:\nY-Yes, Your Honor. Is there a problem?Judge:\nI was under the impression that Marvin Grossberg was to be leading the defense.Mia:\nYes! Well, you see... Mr. Grossberg had... A-A bit of an emergency...Judge:\nEmergency? But isn't that him standing there right next to you?Mia:\nYes, well...Judge:\nYou... You're just a rookie. Are you sure you can really handle this?Mia:\n(Don't let him scare you, Mia! Give him your toughest look!) Of course, Your Honor! ... I think.Judge:\nHmm... Well, Mr. Payne. Your opening statement, please.Payne:\nWell, well, well... I can't believe a veteran like me has to spend his time baby-sitting a new defense lawyer.Mia:\n...!Payne:\nDon't worry little girl. It will all be over soon.Mia:\n(What was that all about? Was he trying to trash-talk me?)Payne:\nNow then, I'd like to proceed with a summary of events on the day in question. The incident occurred on the campus of Ivy University. The murder victim was a student named Doug Swallow. He was a fourth year student studying Pharmacology.Judge:\nHmm... It sounds like he was a very bright young man.Payne:\nYes, well, next we have a photo taken at the scene of the crime. Students discovered the scene shortly after the murder. They found the victim's body... ...and the defendant, who had obviously bungled his getaway. They then called the police.Judge:\nHmm... That certainly makes the defendant look very suspicious indeed. Very well. The court accepts this photo into the record as evidence.Crime Photo 1 added to the Court Record.Judge:\nBy the way... I can't quite tell the cause of death from this photo.Payne:\nHee, hee, hee... Your reputation for sagacity is well-earned, Your Honor. The truth is that this victim died a rather unusual death.Mia:\nAn unusual death...!?Judge:\nWhat do you mean, Mr. Payne!?Payne:\nWell... Perhaps the defense would like to take this question.Mia:\nHuh...!?Payne:\nA simple question. I thought I might loosen you up a bit. I am a genteel-man, if you will.Mia:\nUm, a what? (Stand up to him, Mia! Show him what you're made of!)Grossberg:\nAh, a perfect opportunity! Well, what was it? The cause! Go on! ... ...Please say you know at least this much.Mia:\nI-I'm so sorry... I-I didn't get a chance to read through the whole file.Grossberg:\n*groan* My hemorrhoids are beginning to act up... Now see here! The details of the case are filed under the Court Record. But you knew that already, didn't you?Mia:\n(Ah! The Court Record! I think I can see that by pressing [the R Button / Tab]...) (Changed from [Ah! The Court Record! I think I can see that by touching the Court Record Button...] in the original release)Grossberg:\nAll of the weapons we need can be found in the Court Record. Take a good, hard look at the data there and think carefully before you answer, m'dear!Mia:\nY-Yes, sir! I'll do just that! (I've got to stay calm! I can't let that prosecutor get the better of me! The Court Record... OK, let's take a look! I just press [the R Button / Tab] here... (Changed from [The Court Record... OK, let's take a look! I just touch the Court Record Button here...] in the original release))Judge:\nNow then, would the attorney for the defense please answer the question? What was the cause of death?Asphyxiation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nWell... I think you'll find it was a case of asphyxiation.\nJudge:\nHmm... Asphyxiation, huh?\nGrossberg:\nM-Mia! What are you doing!? (Changed from [M-Mia! What are you saying!?] in the original release)\nMia:\nWell, it's stuffy in here! I can hardly breathe.\nGrossberg:\nNo one's asking how you feel! Please, make sure to properly read the Court Record!\nMia:\nI-I'm so sorry! I'll take a better look! (Hang in there, Mia! Okay! The Court Record is [the R Button / Tab]...) (Changed from [Hang in there, Mia! Open the Court Record with the Court Record Button...] in the original release)\nJudge:\nHmm... I'll ask you once again.\nLeads back to:\n\"What was the cause of death?\"Electrocution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"According to the Court Record, it was a fatal electric shock. In other words, electrocution.\"Hypothermia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nErr... Hypothermia, I believe.\n... ... ......\nMia:\nUmm, Mr. Grossberg? Does it suddenly feel very cold in here to you?\nGrossberg:\nThat's because your absurd reply has brought a chill to the courtroom!\nMia:\nI-I'm so sorry...\nGrossberg:\nLook at the Court Record more carefully, would you! How can you expect to win a case this way!?\nMia:\n(Hang in there, Mia! Okay! The Court Record is [the R Button / Tab]...) (Changed from [Hang in there, Mia! Open the Court Record with the Court Record Button...] in the original release)\nJudge:\nHmm... I'll ask you once again.\nLeads back to:\n\"What was the cause of death?\"Mia:\nAccording to the Court Record, it was a fatal electric shock. In other words, electrocution.Judge:\nElectrocution? Hmm... But how could such a thing happen? Did the murderer use some type of new, super-powerful stun-gun, perhaps?Payne:\nThe answer to that will become crystal clear as this trial proceeds, Your Honor. But before that, there is one more vital issue.Mia:\nWh-What's that?Payne:\nWhy, motive of course. Apparently there was some bad blood between the victim and the defendant.Judge:\nBad blood...?Mia:\nWh-What do you mean...?Payne:\nOopsie! I'm terribly sorry. You're the defense attorney, so you must know all about it. I shouldn't be stealing your spotlight like this.Mia:\n(I really don't like this guy's smug attitude...)Grossberg:\nThat's Winston Payne for you. He is one smooth operator, if you catch my drift. They don't call him the \"Rookie Killer\" for nothing, you know.Judge:\nNow then, let's hear from the defense. What was the source of the bad blood between the victim and the defendant? And this time, I would like to see some supporting evidence!Mia:\nEv-Evidence...?Grossberg:\nAh, no need to get all worked up over this. As I said, all our weapons can be found in the Court Record. Find the evidence you need and then shove it into Ol' Graybeard's face!Mia:\nY-Yes, sir! Into Ol' Graybeard's face!Judge:\nErr, Mr. Grossberg. Try to set a better example for the young lady!Grossberg:\nMia, evidence isn't the only thing in the Court Record. People's profiles are as well. You can toggle between Profiles and Evidence with [the R Button / Tab], so be sure to go over it all! (Changed from [You can toggle between Profiles and Evidence, so be sure to go over it all!] in the original release)Judge:\nNow then, let's see what you've got. What was the cause of the bad blood between Phoenix Wright and the victim?Present Dahlia Hawthorne profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The reason for the bad blood between the two of them was... this woman here.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nJudge:\nMr. Grossberg... I honestly think it would be best for the defense if you were in charge. I'm afraid Ms. Fey might stir up some bad blood with this court if she were to continue.\nGrossberg:\nOr simply put, you are quite mistaken, m'dear.\nMia:\nOh no... I'm so sorry...\nJudge:\nEven if you are new, your lack of preparation is inexcusable. Now take a moment and think it over again.\nMia:\nY-Yes, Your Honor! (It's OK! You've got another chance, Mia!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Mia, evidence isn't the only thing in the Court Record.\"Mia:\nThe reason for the bad blood between the two of them was... this woman here.Judge:\nDahlia Hawthorne, is it?Payne:\nVery good, Ms. Fey. You seem to have picked up on at least this much. This woman is the girlfriend of the defendant, Phoenix Wright. But up until about eight months ago, she was with the victim, Mr. Swallow. Clearly she has some part to play in this story.Judge:\nHmm...Grossberg:\nAh, he's done it again. Before the cross-examination starts, he's already got the judge thinking like he wants.Judge:\nVery well, Mr. Payne. Please call your first witness!Payne:\nIf it pleases the court, the prosecution would like to call Mr. Phoenix Wright.Judge:\nWhat? The defendant himself? Well, Ms. Fey?Mia:\n(It's fine! After all, Mr. Wright is innocent, right?) The defense has no objection.Judge:\nVery well. The court calls Mr. Phoenix Wright to the witness stand!Payne:\nWitness, please state your name and occupation.Phoenix:\nOh, ah, yes... My name is Phoenix Wright. My job is, um... Well, right now, I guess I'm a suspect.Judge:\nNo, no. He means what did you do before you were arrested?Phoenix:\nOh... *achoo* *achoo* *achoo* I was a university student.Payne:\nMr. Wright. You understand that you are suspected in the death of your fellow student, Doug Swa--Phoenix:\nBut! But I didn't do it! I'm innocent I tell you! I'm telling you I was... *achoo* *achoo* *cough* *cough* *achoo* *cough*Judge:\nWould the defendant please refrain from passing on his cold to the rest of us!Payne:\nIt seems the witness has something he wants to say.Judge:\nHmm... Well then, Mr. Wright. Please tell us about your relation to the victim.Phoenix:\nRight away, Your Honor!Witness Testimony-- The Victim and I --Phoenix:\nUm, I... I admit I was there...\nBut I'm not a killer! All I did was find his body!\nI hardly knew the guy to begin with...\nI never even talked to that stuck-up British wannabe!Judge:\nHmm... I see. So you hardly knew the victim?Phoenix:\nRight! Like I said, I'm not a killer!Mia:\nWhew... It looks like the judge understands.Grossberg:\nMmfph... You're being na\u00efve, you know. Too na\u00efve.Mia:\nHuh...?Payne:\nHee, hee, hee, hee, hee. It seems that you've forgotten one small thing, young lady.Mia:\nAnd that would be...?Payne:\nThis witness still has to undergo something called cross-examination.Mia:\nCross-examination...?Grossberg:\nHe's right. And it's the defense's duty to carry out the cross-examination. The purpose is to determine if a witness's testimony contains any contradictions.Mia:\nContradictions...?Grossberg:\nIf a witness is lying, their statements will conflict with the Court Record.Mia:\nBut... Mr. Wright is my client!Grossberg:\nEven if he is your client, in court, all lies must be struck down. As a lawyer, that is your duty, you see.Mia:\n(What does he mean by that? Is he saying that testimony just now... That there was a lie -- a contradiction?)Judge:\nNow then, your cross-examination, if you please, Ms. Fey.Mia:\n(Please, Mr. Wright... Tell me you haven't been lying! You wouldn't do that to me... would you...?)Cross Examination-- The Victim and I --Phoenix:\nUm, I... I admit I was there...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nWhen you say \"there\", you mean the place where the victim was murdered?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, sort of. The place where SOMETHING happened anyway.\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\n\"Something\"? You can't hide what happened. We have photographic evidence.\nPhoenix:\n*achoo* *achoo* *achoo* *achoo*\nMia:\nA-Anyway, Mr. Wright... What were you doing at the scene of the crime? I thought you said you didn't know the victim, Mr. Swallow.\nPhoenix:\nIt was just a coincidence! We bumped into each other by accident.\nJudge:\nA coincidence, huh...?Phoenix:\nBut I'm not a killer! All I did was find his body!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nYou say you found the body? So who called the police?\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? Um... *achoo* *cough* *achoo* *cough* *achoo* *cough*\nPayne:\nUnfortunately it was some other students that notified the police.\nJudge:\n\"Other students\"...?\nPayne:\nThat's correct. They were witnesses. Witnesses who saw the defendant standing there, next to the body, in shock!\nJudge:\nW-What! Is this true, Mr. Wright!?\nPhoenix:\n*achoo* *achoo* *achoo* *achoo* *achoo* *achoo*\nMia:\n(Could you stop sneezing every time you're in a bind...?)\nPhoenix:\nW-Well, it's true that I was pretty shocked when I found the body. But, but I...Phoenix:\nI hardly knew the guy to begin with...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nSo, you didn't know his face, or even his name, right?\nPhoenix:\nRight! Um, well, no... That is... I mean...\nMia:\nSo... Which is it? Did you know him or not?\nPhoenix:\n*achoo* *achoo* *achoo*\nJudge:\nNow, see here! You can't avoid answering the question by sneezing all day!\nPhoenix:\nErr... Umm, well... I guess I did know his name.\nMia:\n(N-News to me! Why didn't he tell me that before...?)\nPhoenix:\nUm... I heard he used to date Dollie.\nJudge:\nWho is this \"Dollie\" person?\nPayne:\nAh yes, that would be the defendant's lover, Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne.\nJudge:\nOh, I see. Ah, young love... So bittersweet...\nPhoenix:\nBut that's all I knew about him!Phoenix:\nI never even talked to that stuck-up British wannabe!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nMr. Wright, you stated the following in your testimony: \"I hardly knew the guy to begin with...\"\nPhoenix:\nTh-That's right! I mean why would I even--\nMia:\nBut that doesn't sound right. If you hardly knew him... ...then why would you say that the victim was a \"stuck-up British wannabe\"!?\nPhoenix:\n...\nMia:\n...\nPhoenix:\n... *achoo*\nMia:\nWell, Mr. Wright!?\nPhoenix:\nAh! No! It wasn't me! I'm not a killer, I swear!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. I will give you an opportunity to revise your testimony. How is it that you knew the victim was, as you put it, a \"British wannabe\"...?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, well...\nAdds statement \"He was always walking around with a huge Union Jack on the back of his shirt.\"Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nMr. Wright, you stated the following in your testimony: \"I hardly knew the guy to begin with...\"\nPhoenix:\nTh-That's right! I mean why would I even--\nMia:\nBut that doesn't sound right. If you hardly knew him... ...then why would you say that the victim was a \"stuck-up British wannabe\"!?\nPhoenix:\nUm, well, you see...Phoenix:\nHe was always walking around with a huge Union Jack on the back of his shirt.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nDid you see it at the crime scene? The Union Jack, I mean.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, that's right! I saw it at the crime scene! That's why... That's why I figured he must love British stuff, see? It's true! Cross my heart! I swear I didn't do it...\nMia:\n(He's acting fishier than the salmon I ate last night...)\nJudge:\nMay I ask you something, Ms. Fey?\nMia:\nY-Yes, Your Honor. (What is it now?)\nJudge:\nWho is this person anyway? This \"Union Jack\" fellow...\nMia:\n...\nPayne:\nThe Union Jack is the name of the flag of England.\nJudge:\nOh, I see... So you mean like the \"Stars and Stripes\", right?\nPayne:\nAs usual, Your Honor, your insight astounds me.\nMia:\n(Hey, something just occurred to me... Isn't there something strange about this bit just now?)\nGrossberg:\nMia... There is a contradiction here!\nMia:\nM-Mr. Grossberg!\nGrossberg:\nQuickly now! Show that boy you mean business! With evidence, I mean!\nMia:\n(OK, Mia, check the Court Record carefully!)Present Crime Photo 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Are you certain you saw the \"Union Jack\"?\"Grossberg:\nWell m'dear, do you think you can manage on your own from this point?I can handle it myself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n(One year ago... I was in a courtroom just like this. I can do it. I can handle this myself!)\nGrossberg:\nMmrgh... You mustn't try to bite off more than you can chew, Mia.\nMia:\nI-I'll be fine! I know what I have to do!\nGrossberg:\nRemember, you can always press him to get more information. Oh, and one more thing. When you're going to state a contradiction, make sure you present some definitive proof.\nMia:\n(OK, Mia. One more time, from the very beginning of his testimony!)I need some help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nUmm, Mr. Grossberg... I could use a little help...\nGrossberg:\nAh, please don't look so sad. It brings a tear to my eye when you do. Alright, listen carefully. By comparing the testimony to the Court Record... ...you should be able to discover any contradictions, if there are any. And when you've found one...\nMia:\nI present the piece of evidence that contradicts the witness's testimony...?\nGrossberg:\nYes. That's the ticket!\nMia:\nBut still... I don't see any contradictions in Mr. Wright's testimony!\nGrossberg:\nHmm... Maybe you don't have enough information yet.\nMia:\nInformation...?\nGrossberg:\nYou can press for more information by leaning on a witness.\nMia:\nEven if they're my own client?\nGrossberg:\nIt doesn't matter who it is, if you think they're lying, press them like a cheap suit! That is the obligation of an attorney.\nMia:\n(OK, Mia. One more time, from the very beginning of his testimony!)Mia:\nAre you certain you saw the \"Union Jack\"?Phoenix:\nY-Yeah, I'm sure. It was right there on his back.Judge:\nMs. Fey, is there some point to this line of questioning?Mia:\nYour Honor, please take another look at the crime scene photo. As you can see, there's absolutely nothing written on the victim's back.Phoenix:\nHey! Wait a minute! He's wearing a leather jacket! The Union Jack was on the back of the t-shirt he was wearing...Mia:\nI was under the impression that you accidentally came across the body. But, if that was really the case, then you wouldn't know that, would you? You'd have no idea at all what he was wearing underneath that jacket! Mr. Wright... You've been lying to me!Phoenix:\n... P-P-P-Please forgive me! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!Grossberg:\nMia! You've made our client cry!Mia:\nLet him! That \"P\" on his chest doesn't stand for \"Phoenix\" anyways! I can't believe I trusted him! Mr. Wright was all wrong!Payne:\nHee, hee, hee, hee. That was an impressive bit of cross-examination.Mia:\n...!Payne:\nThank you for uncovering the defendant's lies for me. It's quite clear that this man did not simply \"stumble upon\" the scene of the crime!Phoenix:\nUggghhh...Mia:\n(Uh oh... Did I go too far?)Payne:\nBy the way, Mr. Wright. You seem to have a rather bad cold. Have you taken any medicine for it?Phoenix:\nI, err, umm... Yeah, I took some but...Payne:\nWas the medicine that you took an over-the-counter brand called \"Coldkiller X\"?Phoenix:\nYeah, that's right! It kills colds good! Hey, wait a second... How did you know I'm a big fan of Coldkiller X...?Payne:\nHee, hee, hee, hee... Would you happen to have that medicine with you right now?Phoenix:\nWell... Actually, I seem to have lost it somewhere...Mia:\n(He lost it? Does this even have anything to do with the case...?)Payne:\nMr. Wright... Shall I tell you where your cold medicine is right now?Phoenix:\nHuh...?Payne:\nYour Honor! I'd like you to take a look at another photo from the crime scene!Judge:\nWh-What's this! In the victim's hand, it's... It's Coldkiller X...!Mia:Mia:\nY-Yes, but even I've got a bottle of Coldkiller X in my apartment!Payne:Payne:\nI'm sorry, but I'm afraid that argument won't work. There's no doubt as to who this bottle of Coldkiller X belonged to. Especially since Mr. Wright's fingerprints were all over it!Mia:\nWh-What!?Payne:\nSensing his murderous intent, Mr. Swallow must have picked up the bottle of medicine... ...dropped by Mr. Wright and hid it in his hand. His purpose in doing so can only have been to identify his killer as Phoenix Wright!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court!Payne:\nYour Honor! I'd like to present this photo and bottle as evidence!Judge:\nVery well. The court will accept them into the record.Crime Photo 2 added to the Court Record.Coldkiller X added to the Court Record.Payne:\nAlso, the victim's wristwatch was broken.Judge:\nBroken...?Payne:\nYes, it ceased functioning when a large wave of electricity passed through it. Well, Mr. Wright! Do you have some kind of explanation for all of this!?Phoenix:\nUggghhh...Mia:\n(This is really bad...)Grossberg:\nOh, my buttocks... My poor, poor hemorrhoids...Witness Testimony-- What Really Happened --Phoenix:\nThe truth is... I went because he called me.\nHe was in the Pharmacology Dept., so we agreed to meet at 2:45 behind that building...\nWe talked for a bit, and then at around 3:00, we split up.\nThen later when I went back, I found him lying there.\nI'd been taking Coldkiller X for the last 2 or 3 days...\nBut I lost my bottle of it around lunchtime on the day of the accident.Judge:\nMr. Wright! That's completely different than the testimony you gave previously!Phoenix:\n*achoo* *achoo* *achoo* I-I'm sorry, Your Honor! I was afraid you wouldn't believe the truth!Payne:\nYou'll forgive me if I say I hardly find your current testimony any more credible.Judge:\nHmm... Ms. Fey, please begin your cross-examination.Mia:\n(Oh please, Mr. Wright... Don't tell any more lies.)Cross Examination-- What Really Happened --Phoenix:\nThe truth is... I went because he called me.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nHad you ever met the victim before then?\nPhoenix:\nNo! Never! ... But... That day, he called me up and told me he wanted to talk about Dollie.\nJudge:\nAnd this \"Dollie\" person is...?\nPhoenix:\nMy um... It's kind of embarrassing. She's my, umm, sweetheart...\nGrossberg:\nOomph...! Wh-What... What was that for, Mia!?\nMia:\nOh! I'm so sorry! I just felt like slapping something all of a sudden!\nPayne:\nDahlia Hawthorne was also the lover of the murder victim, Doug Swallow. ...Before she met Mr. Wright, that is.\nJudge:\nHmm... So it was one of those nasty love triangles, I see...Phoenix:\nHe was in the Pharmacology Dept., so we agreed to meet at 2:45 behind that building...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nWas it Mr. Swallow who indicated you should meet at 2:45?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. And we were both there right on time.\nJudge:\nHmm... You said the victim was in the Pharmacology Dept., correct?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, he was studying how to manufacture and improve pharmaceuticals. Everyone called him the \"Alchemist of Ivy U\".\nJudge:\nAn \"alchemist\"... I see...\nPhoenix:\nI gotta admit it was a little suspicious. He had a whole laboratory and everything! It was filled with chemicals and strange machines that run on high-voltage electricity.\nJudge:\nHo ho. How fascinating. He sounds like he was quite an ambitious young man.\nMia:\n(What do I do!? Maybe I should ask him for some more details?)\n\n\n\nAbout timing of the meeting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nSo you are absolutely certain that you met at 2:45?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, pretty sure. That's the time class ends. But they're always doing experiments, so it doesn't matter much.\nMia:\nExperiments...?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. Those pharmacology guys are always in the lab whipping up something.\nMia:\n(Well, it looks like he's right about the time anyway.)\nPayne:\nWitness, let's go on with your testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nAbout Pharmacology Dept.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nI was wondering if you could tell us a bit more about the Pharmacology Department.\nPhoenix:\nWell OK, sure. I don't know all that much though.\nMia:\nA little bit earlier in your testimony, you said something interesting. You said the department uses strange machines that run on high-voltage electricity.\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. And they sure look dangerous. They use non-standard voltages, so there are high-voltage cables everywhere.\nMia:\n\"High-voltage cables\"...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, there were electrical poles set up all around the building. The high-voltage cables run overhead around the roof.\nMia:\n(Finally I think we're getting somewhere...!)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nForget about it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n(I've gotten everything I need from this statement. It's time to move on.)\nPayne:\nIn any case, let's continue with your testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examinationPhoenix:\nWe talked for a bit, and then at around 3:00, we split up.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nSo what was it you were talking about?\nPhoenix:\nYou know... *achoo* *cough* That maybe we should hang out again sometime.\nMia:\n(\"Hang out again sometime\"? I wish that were true.)Phoenix:\nThen later when I went back, I found him lying there.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nSo you say you went back...\nPhoenix:\nUmm, yeah. That's when I found the body.\nMia:\nYes, but why did you go back in the first place? Weren't you angry with him?\nPhoenix:\nWell, th-that's right, I was. ...\nMia:\nThen why, Mr. Wright? Why did you go back there?\nPhoenix:\n... Umm... I thought maybe we could make up.\nMia:\n...\nPayne:\n...\nJudge:\n...\nPhoenix:\n... *achoo* *achoo*\nMia:\n(Judging by the atmosphere... I'm pretty sure no one is buying this.)Phoenix:\nI'd been taking Coldkiller X for the last 2 or 3 days...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nIt's rather unusual to catch a cold this time of the year, isn't it?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I always get a little careless when the weather starts to warm up. I guess I shouldn't sleep with the window open this early in spring, huh?\nMia:\n(I suppose common sense is not always common...) So... Did anyone else know that you were taking cold medicine?\nPhoenix:\nWell, I always took one after meals... So I'm pretty sure all my friends knew about it.Phoenix:\nBut I lost my bottle of it around lunchtime on the day of the accident.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nOn the day of the incident, what did you do for lunch...?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? What does that have to do with anything?\nMia:\nYou can never be too sure...\nPhoenix:\nI always eat with Dollie... Just the two of us. Dollie's homemade lunches are just the greatest! Mmm! Her mini-omelettes are magically delicious! Eheh heh heh.\nGrossberg:\nYeowch!! Wh-Why did you punch me in the jaw!?\nMia:\nOh! I-I'm so sorry...! I just felt like hurting someone all of a sudden!Grossberg:\nWell, Mia?Mia:\nI don't know... I can't seem to find any contradictions.Grossberg:\nThe boy isn't exactly what I'd call a natural-born liar, you know. But still, we can't have him continue to spout nonsense.Mia:\nI know... But what can I do!?Grossberg:\nWell, I'm certain he must still be hiding something. Information! Right now it's information we need more than anything else!After pressing sixth statement and selecting \"About Pharmacology Dept.\" upon pressing second statement:Judge:\nI think that's enough for now. So the defendant and the victim met at approximately the time of his death. And then the defendant returned to the scene for some unknown reason.Payne:\nI'm not entirely convinced by his explanation about the medicine bottle either.Judge:\nLet me be frank here, Mr. Wright. Your testimony cannot be trusted.Phoenix:\nWh-What do you mean!?Payne:\nHee, hee, hee, hee... I knew it was too much work for a little girl.Mia:\nHmph...!Judge:\nHowever, there is one mystery that still remains.Payne:\nThere is, Your Honor?Judge:\nHow the murder was carried out, of course. Just how was the victim electrocuted? I don't believe the murder weapon has been produced yet, correct?Payne:\nWell, that is... I... You are correct, Your Honor.Mia:\n(So how exactly was Mr. Swallow killed...? If I could somehow establish how it was done... Maybe I could still come out of this mess smelling like a rose!)Establish murder method\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor!\"Can't right now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n(Hmm, I do have one idea, but it would be impossible to prove it.)\nGrossberg:\nMia, m'dear. If you have any ideas, now is the time to present them.\nMia:\nMr. Grossberg!\nGrossberg:\nRemember, silence is NOT golden. ...In court, anyway.\nMia:\n(Silence is not golden, huh? Well in that case...)\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor!\"Mia:\nYour Honor!Judge:\nY-Yes, Ms. Fey?Mia:\nI believe that if we were to piece together everything we've heard up until now... ...we should be able to solve the mystery of how Mr. Swallow died.Judge:\nTh-That would be most impressive!Payne:\nHee, hee, hee, hee... Quite the brash statement coming from a rookie! But even a beginner like you must understand the basic rules of the court, yes? An attorney must be able to substantiate their arguments with evidence!Mia:\nHmph! Of course I know that! (Actually, I had totally forgotten about that...)Judge:\nNow then, Ms. Fey. Let me see what you've got. Show me how you believe the victim was electrocuted!Present Crime Photo 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"As for the cause of death...\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nJudge:\nMs. Fey, I'm deeply disappointed in you.\nPayne:\nI'm disappointed as well, Ms. Fey.\nGrossberg:\nTo be honest, I'm a bit disappointed too, Mia.\nPhoenix:\n... *achoo*\nMia:\n(Argh! I need to use my brain on this! Come on, Mia! You can't strike out here!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Now then, Ms. Fey. Let me see what you've got.\"Mia:\nAs for the cause of death... ...I'd say this picture captures it quite well!Judge:\nWh-What!? But there is nothing that even remotely resembles a murder weapon here... Hmm, I'm afraid the defense is going to have to explain this in a bit more detail. Ms. Fey, where exactly in this photo is the murder weapon?Present downed power line\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Well, naturally... it's right here!\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nWell naturally... it's right around here! ...I think.\nJudge:\nMs. Fey, I'm deeply disappointed in you.\nPayne:\nI'm disappointed as well, Ms. Fey.\nGrossberg:\nTo be honest, I'm a bit disappointed too, Mia.\nPhoenix:\n... *achoo*\nMia:\n(Argh! I need to use my brain on this! Come on, Mia! You can't strike out here!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Ms. Fey, where exactly in this photo is the murder weapon?\"Mia:\nWell, naturally... it's right here!Judge:\nThat's... That's... What is that?Mia:\nA severed electrical cable, I believe... Your Honor. Remember the testimony we've heard. The machines the pharmacology students use in their experiments require high voltage... ...and because of that, there are special high-voltage cables strung up everywhere!Judge:\nSo then, the high-voltage cable...!Mia:\nYes, the high-voltage cable is the cause of death. That is the most likely explanation!Judge:\nHmm... That certainly sounds plausible. Well, Mr. Payne? What do you have to say about this?Payne:\nWell... I believe some praise is in order.Mia:\nDon't toy with me, old man!Payne:\nNow, now. The victim's cause of death may indeed have been a high-voltage cable. However! I want you to think about what that really implies! The only one who had the opportunity to use the cable as a murder weapon was... The defendant!Phoenix:\n... *achoo*Judge:\nHmm... That much is certainly true.Payne:\nYes, and that's not all. We have proof. Irrefutable proof that will establish that Mr. Wright was the murderer.Judge:\nY-You do!? Well, what is it!?Payne:\nHis fingerprints.Judge:\nFingerprints...? You mean that the defendant's fingerprints were on something besides the medicine bottle?Payne:\nLet's take another look at the crime scene photo. As you can see, the victim is wearing a leather jacket. And as you may know, leather holds fingerprints quite well.Mia:\nAh! Y-You mean...?Payne:\nYes. It was quite clearly imprinted on the chest area of the victim's jacket. The palm print of the defendant's very own hand!Judge:\nWh-Whaaat!?Payne:\nI can only think of one way Mr. Wright could have left a print like that. Intent on murder, he squarely pushed the victim towards the severed electrical cable!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! That's enough! I think we can conclude that there is no reason to continue with this cross-examination.Grossberg:\nStick a fork in us, we're done.Mia:\nM-Mr. Grossberg!Grossberg:\nMy hemorrhoids never lie. The show is over, Mia. I knew that boy was guilty the first time I saw him.Mia:\nN-No! You're wrong! Mr. Wright is innocent.Judge:\nNo further evidence is required to convince me of this man's guilt!Mia:\nY-Your Honor...!Judge:\nAt this time, I am prepared to render a verdict in this case!Mia:Judge:\nDo you have something further to add, Ms. Fey?Mia:\nIs this what you want, Mr. Wright!?Phoenix:\n...!Mia:\nYou still haven't told us the truth... the whole truth. If you don't say something now, the judge is going to hand down his verdict!Phoenix:\nB-But I... I can't! I-I just can't say it! If I told you what really happened, then I'd b-be...Mia:\nIt's OK, Mr. Wright. I'm your attorney. You can trust me.Phoenix:\nM-Miss Fey...Mia:\nNo matter what it is you have to say... I believe in you and I'll represent you to the very end.Phoenix:\n...!Payne:Payne:\nWe've already established the defendant's guilt. There's no further need for him to say anything.Phoenix:\n*cough* *cough* W-Wait a minute!Mia:\nMr. Wright...Phoenix:\nI... I'll tell you what really happened!Payne:Payne:\nBut I've already told you, Mr. Wright. There's no need for further...Phoenix:\n*cough* I-I-I... I did it... I admit it! I pushed him! It's my fault... My f-fault that D-Doug Swallow is dead!That girl... You shouldn't see her anymore.Hey! It's none of your business!I'm telling you for your sake. If you continue to see her, it's going to be bad news.Y-You're lying!Just listen to me. There's something you need to know about that girl......Stop it! D-Don't talk about her like that!Judge:\n... What you just said... Was that the truth!?Phoenix:\nY-Yes, I... I was afraid... Afraid that if I told the truth... ...everyone would think I was the murderer for sure!Judge:\nWell, as things currently stand, we're all absolutely convinced you are!Phoenix:\nP-Please...! Please give me one more chance to explain! This time I swear... I swear I'll tell the whole truth! It'll be OK, won't it, Miss Fey? I... I believe in you!Mia:\nOh! Um, th-thank you. (I still can't believe it... He really did push the victim...)Grossberg:\nUnnngh... It feels like my hemorrhoids are doing the Harlem Shake!Witness Testimony-- When I Pushed The Victim --Phoenix:\nThat guy... He was talking bad about Dollie...\nI lost my temper and gave him a shove!\nAt that moment, I heard some kind of loud noise...\nA little while after I left, I started to get worried.\nSo I went back. But h-he was just lying there, d-dead!Payne:\nWell, the explanation is really quite simple. When you pushed him, Mr. Swallow flew back and touched the electrical cable. He died from the shock. And that, as they say, is that.Judge:\nHmm... A simple explanation indeed.Payne:\nAt the time of the incident, a light rain had been falling. Wet from the rain, the victim was more easily electrocuted.Phoenix:\nB-But! When I pushed him, there weren't any electrical cables nearby! If there had been something like that, even I would've noticed it!Mia:\n(That's true... Even a dufus like him couldn't miss that!)Judge:\nHmm... Ms. Fey. Let me warn you right now that if your cross-examination doesn't yield any new facts... ...I intend to deliver my verdict without further delay. Are we clear on that?Mia:\nY-Yes, Your Honor. (Don't give up, Mia! If he is innocent, there must be some kind of evidence somewhere that will prove it!)Cross Examination",

So I'm pretty sure all my friends knew about it.Phoenix:\nBut I lost my bottle of it around lunchtime on the day of the accident.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nOn the day of the incident, what did you do for lunch...?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? What does that have to do with anything?\nMia:\nYou can never be too sure...\nPhoenix:\nI always eat with Dollie... Just the two of us. Dollie's homemade lunches are just the greatest! Mmm! Her mini-omelettes are magically delicious! Eheh heh heh.\nGrossberg:\nYeowch!! Wh-Why did you punch me in the jaw!?\nMia:\nOh! I-I'm so sorry...! I just felt like hurting someone all of a sudden!Grossberg:\nWell, Mia?Mia:\nI don't know... I can't seem to find any contradictions.Grossberg:\nThe boy isn't exactly what I'd call a natural-born liar, you know. But still, we can't have him continue to spout nonsense.Mia:\nI know... But what can I do!?Grossberg:\nWell, I'm certain he must still be hiding something. Information! Right now it's information we need more than anything else!After pressing sixth statement and selecting \"About Pharmacology Dept.\" upon pressing second statement:Judge:\nI think that's enough for now. So the defendant and the victim met at approximately the time of his death. And then the defendant returned to the scene for some unknown reason.Payne:\nI'm not entirely convinced by his explanation about the medicine bottle either.Judge:\nLet me be frank here, Mr. Wright. Your testimony cannot be trusted.Phoenix:\nWh-What do you mean!?Payne:\nHee, hee, hee, hee... I knew it was too much work for a little girl.Mia:\nHmph...!Judge:\nHowever, there is one mystery that still remains.Payne:\nThere is, Your Honor?Judge:\nHow the murder was carried out, of course. Just how was the victim electrocuted? I don't believe the murder weapon has been produced yet, correct?Payne:\nWell, that is... I... You are correct, Your Honor.Mia:\n(So how exactly was Mr. Swallow killed...? If I could somehow establish how it was done... Maybe I could still come out of this mess smelling like a rose!)Establish murder method\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor!\"Can't right now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n(Hmm, I do have one idea, but it would be impossible to prove it.)\nGrossberg:\nMia, m'dear. If you have any ideas, now is the time to present them.\nMia:\nMr. Grossberg!\nGrossberg:\nRemember, silence is NOT golden. ...In court, anyway.\nMia:\n(Silence is not golden, huh? Well in that case...)\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor!\"Mia:\nYour Honor!Judge:\nY-Yes, Ms. Fey?Mia:\nI believe that if we were to piece together everything we've heard up until now... ...we should be able to solve the mystery of how Mr. Swallow died.Judge:\nTh-That would be most impressive!Payne:\nHee, hee, hee, hee... Quite the brash statement coming from a rookie! But even a beginner like you must understand the basic rules of the court, yes? An attorney must be able to substantiate their arguments with evidence!Mia:\nHmph! Of course I know that! (Actually, I had totally forgotten about that...)Judge:\nNow then, Ms. Fey. Let me see what you've got. Show me how you believe the victim was electrocuted!Present Crime Photo 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"As for the cause of death...\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nJudge:\nMs. Fey, I'm deeply disappointed in you.\nPayne:\nI'm disappointed as well, Ms. Fey.\nGrossberg:\nTo be honest, I'm a bit disappointed too, Mia.\nPhoenix:\n... *achoo*\nMia:\n(Argh! I need to use my brain on this! Come on, Mia! You can't strike out here!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Now then, Ms. Fey. Let me see what you've got.\"Mia:\nAs for the cause of death... ...I'd say this picture captures it quite well!Judge:\nWh-What!? But there is nothing that even remotely resembles a murder weapon here... Hmm, I'm afraid the defense is going to have to explain this in a bit more detail. Ms. Fey, where exactly in this photo is the murder weapon?Present downed power line\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Well, naturally... it's right here!\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nWell naturally... it's right around here! ...I think.\nJudge:\nMs. Fey, I'm deeply disappointed in you.\nPayne:\nI'm disappointed as well, Ms. Fey.\nGrossberg:\nTo be honest, I'm a bit disappointed too, Mia.\nPhoenix:\n... *achoo*\nMia:\n(Argh! I need to use my brain on this! Come on, Mia! You can't strike out here!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Ms. Fey, where exactly in this photo is the murder weapon?\"Mia:\nWell, naturally... it's right here!Judge:\nThat's... That's... What is that?Mia:\nA severed electrical cable, I believe... Your Honor. Remember the testimony we've heard. The machines the pharmacology students use in their experiments require high voltage... ...and because of that, there are special high-voltage cables strung up everywhere!Judge:\nSo then, the high-voltage cable...!Mia:\nYes, the high-voltage cable is the cause of death. That is the most likely explanation!Judge:\nHmm... That certainly sounds plausible. Well, Mr. Payne? What do you have to say about this?Payne:\nWell... I believe some praise is in order.Mia:\nDon't toy with me, old man!Payne:\nNow, now. The victim's cause of death may indeed have been a high-voltage cable. However! I want you to think about what that really implies! The only one who had the opportunity to use the cable as a murder weapon was... The defendant!Phoenix:\n... *achoo*Judge:\nHmm... That much is certainly true.Payne:\nYes, and that's not all. We have proof. Irrefutable proof that will establish that Mr. Wright was the murderer.Judge:\nY-You do!? Well, what is it!?Payne:\nHis fingerprints.Judge:\nFingerprints...? You mean that the defendant's fingerprints were on something besides the medicine bottle?Payne:\nLet's take another look at the crime scene photo. As you can see, the victim is wearing a leather jacket. And as you may know, leather holds fingerprints quite well.Mia:\nAh! Y-You mean...?Payne:\nYes. It was quite clearly imprinted on the chest area of the victim's jacket. The palm print of the defendant's very own hand!Judge:\nWh-Whaaat!?Payne:\nI can only think of one way Mr. Wright could have left a print like that. Intent on murder, he squarely pushed the victim towards the severed electrical cable!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! That's enough! I think we can conclude that there is no reason to continue with this cross-examination.Grossberg:\nStick a fork in us, we're done.Mia:\nM-Mr. Grossberg!Grossberg:\nMy hemorrhoids never lie. The show is over, Mia. I knew that boy was guilty the first time I saw him.Mia:\nN-No! You're wrong! Mr. Wright is innocent.Judge:\nNo further evidence is required to convince me of this man's guilt!Mia:\nY-Your Honor...!Judge:\nAt this time, I am prepared to render a verdict in this case!Mia:Judge:\nDo you have something further to add, Ms. Fey?Mia:\nIs this what you want, Mr. Wright!?Phoenix:\n...!Mia:\nYou still haven't told us the truth... the whole truth. If you don't say something now, the judge is going to hand down his verdict!Phoenix:\nB-But I... I can't! I-I just can't say it! If I told you what really happened, then I'd b-be...Mia:\nIt's OK, Mr. Wright. I'm your attorney. You can trust me.Phoenix:\nM-Miss Fey...Mia:\nNo matter what it is you have to say... I believe in you and I'll represent you to the very end.Phoenix:\n...!Payne:Payne:\nWe've already established the defendant's guilt. There's no further need for him to say anything.Phoenix:\n*cough* *cough* W-Wait a minute!Mia:\nMr. Wright...Phoenix:\nI... I'll tell you what really happened!Payne:Payne:\nBut I've already told you, Mr. Wright. There's no need for further...Phoenix:\n*cough* I-I-I... I did it... I admit it! I pushed him! It's my fault... My f-fault that D-Doug Swallow is dead!That girl... You shouldn't see her anymore.Hey! It's none of your business!I'm telling you for your sake. If you continue to see her, it's going to be bad news.Y-You're lying!Just listen to me. There's something you need to know about that girl......Stop it! D-Don't talk about her like that!Judge:\n... What you just said... Was that the truth!?Phoenix:\nY-Yes, I... I was afraid... Afraid that if I told the truth... ...everyone would think I was the murderer for sure!Judge:\nWell, as things currently stand, we're all absolutely convinced you are!Phoenix:\nP-Please...! Please give me one more chance to explain! This time I swear... I swear I'll tell the whole truth! It'll be OK, won't it, Miss Fey? I... I believe in you!Mia:\nOh! Um, th-thank you. (I still can't believe it... He really did push the victim...)Grossberg:\nUnnngh... It feels like my hemorrhoids are doing the Harlem Shake!Witness Testimony-- When I Pushed The Victim --Phoenix:\nThat guy... He was talking bad about Dollie...\nI lost my temper and gave him a shove!\nAt that moment, I heard some kind of loud noise...\nA little while after I left, I started to get worried.\nSo I went back. But h-he was just lying there, d-dead!Payne:\nWell, the explanation is really quite simple. When you pushed him, Mr. Swallow flew back and touched the electrical cable. He died from the shock. And that, as they say, is that.Judge:\nHmm... A simple explanation indeed.Payne:\nAt the time of the incident, a light rain had been falling. Wet from the rain, the victim was more easily electrocuted.Phoenix:\nB-But! When I pushed him, there weren't any electrical cables nearby! If there had been something like that, even I would've noticed it!Mia:\n(That's true... Even a dufus like him couldn't miss that!)Judge:\nHmm... Ms. Fey. Let me warn you right now that if your cross-examination doesn't yield any new facts... ...I intend to deliver my verdict without further delay. Are we clear on that?Mia:\nY-Yes, Your Honor. (Don't give up, Mia! If he is innocent, there must be some kind of evidence somewhere that will prove it!)Cross Examination",

Why did I do that...?That girl... You shouldn't see her anymore.Hey! It's none of your business!I'm telling you for your sake. If you continue to see her, it's going to be bad news.Y-You're lying!Just listen to me. There's something you need to know about that girl... ...Stop it! D-Don't talk about her like that!It-It wasn't me! I-I d-didn't... I didn't do it!-- Five Years Earlier --Mia FeySecond TrialApril 11, 9:40 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3Mia:\n(Whew, it's finally time... I'm kind of nervous...)???:\n*Ah-HHHHEM!*Mia:\nOh! Mr. Grossberg! Good morning!Grossberg:\nAh, Mia. Please calm yourself down! You're going to get yourself arrested for suspicious behavior, you know.Mia:\nWhat are you talking about!! I am relaxed, Mr. Grossberg!! Look at me, I'm relaxed!!Grossberg:\n*Grrrmmphh* L-Let go of my lapels! Hmph... You obviously haven't got the temperament to be a lawyer.Mia:\nI, err... I'm so sorry! It's just that I'm so nervous today...Grossberg:\nOh, that's right. This is your first time in the big leagues, isn't it? Well, never you fear my dear. I, Marvin Grossberg, am at your service!Mia:\nUmm, actually this is my second time in court...Grossberg:\nStill, you surprised me... What, with your earnest request last night... \"Let me handle this case!\" you suddenly said. And quite forcefully, too!Mia:\nI just found out yesterday. About the case, I mean.Grossberg:\nWhat? And you've already learned all the relevant facts?Mia:\nWell about that... You see... I mean, of course I have! I think.Grossberg:\nOh dear... In any case, don't let our client see you're so nervous. You see the poor young man in the pink sweater over there? That's our client.Phoenix:\n*cough* *sniffle* Good morning there everybody!Mia:\nGood morning... (Try to keep smiling, Mia!)Phoenix:\nI, err, I just want to say... I'll give it all I've got! Yup, it'll be fine! No prob! *cough* *achoo* *achoo*Mia:\nOh, what's wrong? Do you have a cold or something... Mr. Wry?Phoenix:\nActually, it's Wright... Like the flying brothers... People screw it up all the time. And yes I have a cold. That's what this mask is for. My doc says this way, I won't give it to anyone else... Be kind to others, he says...Mia:\nRight, Mr. Wright! You have nothing to fear in court today! If you are truly innocent... I promise I will save you!Phoenix:\nNnnnggghh... P-Please l-let go of my shirt... *cough*Mia:\n(That's right, he's the one on trial, not you! He's the one who should be nervous! You need to stay strong for your client, Mia!)Mia:\nMy name is Mia Fey. I'm still pretty new at this lawyer thing... The first time I appeared in court was a year ago. But that trial traumatized me so badly, I thought I'd never set foot in another courtroom. It's been one year since then, and well, here I am again. But this time... This time I'm going to win. (Changed from [But this time... This time I'll win.] in the original release) For my client... And for myself.April 11, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Phoenix Wright.Mia:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor!Payne:\nThe prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Judge:\nThe defense today is... Ms... Ms... Mia Fey, was it?Mia:\nY-Yes, Your Honor. Is there a problem?Judge:\nI was under the impression that Marvin Grossberg was to be leading the defense.Mia:\nYes! Well, you see... Mr. Grossberg had... A-A bit of an emergency...Judge:\nEmergency? But isn't that him standing there right next to you?Mia:\nYes, well...Judge:\nYou... You're just a rookie. Are you sure you can really handle this?Mia:\n(Don't let him scare you, Mia! Give him your toughest look!) Of course, Your Honor! ... I think.Judge:\nHmm... Well, Mr. Payne. Your opening statement, please.Payne:\nWell, well, well... I can't believe a veteran like me has to spend his time baby-sitting a new defense lawyer.Mia:\n...!Payne:\nDon't worry little girl. It will all be over soon.Mia:\n(What was that all about? Was he trying to trash-talk me?)Payne:\nNow then, I'd like to proceed with a summary of events on the day in question. The incident occurred on the campus of Ivy University. The murder victim was a student named Doug Swallow. He was a fourth year student studying Pharmacology.Judge:\nHmm... It sounds like he was a very bright young man.Payne:\nYes, well, next we have a photo taken at the scene of the crime. Students discovered the scene shortly after the murder. They found the victim's body... ...and the defendant, who had obviously bungled his getaway. They then called the police.Judge:\nHmm... That certainly makes the defendant look very suspicious indeed. Very well. The court accepts this photo into the record as evidence.Crime Photo 1 added to the Court Record.Judge:\nBy the way... I can't quite tell the cause of death from this photo.Payne:\nHee, hee, hee... Your reputation for sagacity is well-earned, Your Honor. The truth is that this victim died a rather unusual death.Mia:\nAn unusual death...!?Judge:\nWhat do you mean, Mr. Payne!?Payne:\nWell... Perhaps the defense would like to take this question.Mia:\nHuh...!?Payne:\nA simple question. I thought I might loosen you up a bit. I am a genteel-man, if you will.Mia:\nUm, a what? (Stand up to him, Mia! Show him what you're made of!)Grossberg:\nAh, a perfect opportunity! Well, what was it? The cause! Go on! ... ...Please say you know at least this much.Mia:\nI-I'm so sorry... I-I didn't get a chance to read through the whole file.Grossberg:\n*groan* My hemorrhoids are beginning to act up... Now see here! The details of the case are filed under the Court Record. But you knew that already, didn't you?Mia:\n(Ah! The Court Record! I think I can see that by pressing [the R Button / Tab]...) (Changed from [Ah! The Court Record! I think I can see that by touching the Court Record Button...] in the original release)Grossberg:\nAll of the weapons we need can be found in the Court Record. Take a good, hard look at the data there and think carefully before you answer, m'dear!Mia:\nY-Yes, sir! I'll do just that! (I've got to stay calm! I can't let that prosecutor get the better of me! The Court Record... OK, let's take a look! I just press [the R Button / Tab] here... (Changed from [The Court Record... OK, let's take a look! I just touch the Court Record Button here...] in the original release))Judge:\nNow then, would the attorney for the defense please answer the question? What was the cause of death?Asphyxiation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nWell... I think you'll find it was a case of asphyxiation.\nJudge:\nHmm... Asphyxiation, huh?\nGrossberg:\nM-Mia! What are you doing!? (Changed from [M-Mia! What are you saying!?] in the original release)\nMia:\nWell, it's stuffy in here! I can hardly breathe.\nGrossberg:\nNo one's asking how you feel! Please, make sure to properly read the Court Record!\nMia:\nI-I'm so sorry! I'll take a better look! (Hang in there, Mia! Okay! The Court Record is [the R Button / Tab]...) (Changed from [Hang in there, Mia! Open the Court Record with the Court Record Button...] in the original release)\nJudge:\nHmm... I'll ask you once again.\nLeads back to:\n\"What was the cause of death?\"Electrocution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"According to the Court Record, it was a fatal electric shock. In other words, electrocution.\"Hypothermia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nErr... Hypothermia, I believe.\n... ... ......\nMia:\nUmm, Mr. Grossberg? Does it suddenly feel very cold in here to you?\nGrossberg:\nThat's because your absurd reply has brought a chill to the courtroom!\nMia:\nI-I'm so sorry...\nGrossberg:\nLook at the Court Record more carefully, would you! How can you expect to win a case this way!?\nMia:\n(Hang in there, Mia! Okay! The Court Record is [the R Button / Tab]...) (Changed from [Hang in there, Mia! Open the Court Record with the Court Record Button...] in the original release)\nJudge:\nHmm... I'll ask you once again.\nLeads back to:\n\"What was the cause of death?\"Mia:\nAccording to the Court Record, it was a fatal electric shock. In other words, electrocution.Judge:\nElectrocution? Hmm... But how could such a thing happen? Did the murderer use some type of new, super-powerful stun-gun, perhaps?Payne:\nThe answer to that will become crystal clear as this trial proceeds, Your Honor. But before that, there is one more vital issue.Mia:\nWh-What's that?Payne:\nWhy, motive of course. Apparently there was some bad blood between the victim and the defendant.Judge:\nBad blood...?Mia:\nWh-What do you mean...?Payne:\nOopsie! I'm terribly sorry. You're the defense attorney, so you must know all about it. I shouldn't be stealing your spotlight like this.Mia:\n(I really don't like this guy's smug attitude...)Grossberg:\nThat's Winston Payne for you. He is one smooth operator, if you catch my drift. They don't call him the \"Rookie Killer\" for nothing, you know.Judge:\nNow then, let's hear from the defense. What was the source of the bad blood between the victim and the defendant? And this time, I would like to see some supporting evidence!Mia:\nEv-Evidence...?Grossberg:\nAh, no need to get all worked up over this. As I said, all our weapons can be found in the Court Record. Find the evidence you need and then shove it into Ol' Graybeard's face!Mia:\nY-Yes, sir! Into Ol' Graybeard's face!Judge:\nErr, Mr. Grossberg. Try to set a better example for the young lady!Grossberg:\nMia, evidence isn't the only thing in the Court Record. People's profiles are as well. You can toggle between Profiles and Evidence with [the R Button / Tab], so be sure to go over it all! (Changed from [You can toggle between Profiles and Evidence, so be sure to go over it all!] in the original release)Judge:\nNow then, let's see what you've got. What was the cause of the bad blood between Phoenix Wright and the victim?Present Dahlia Hawthorne profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The reason for the bad blood between the two of them was... this woman here.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nJudge:\nMr. Grossberg... I honestly think it would be best for the defense if you were in charge. I'm afraid Ms. Fey might stir up some bad blood with this court if she were to continue.\nGrossberg:\nOr simply put, you are quite mistaken, m'dear.\nMia:\nOh no... I'm so sorry...\nJudge:\nEven if you are new, your lack of preparation is inexcusable. Now take a moment and think it over again.\nMia:\nY-Yes, Your Honor! (It's OK! You've got another chance, Mia!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Mia, evidence isn't the only thing in the Court Record.\"Mia:\nThe reason for the bad blood between the two of them was... this woman here.Judge:\nDahlia Hawthorne, is it?Payne:\nVery good, Ms. Fey. You seem to have picked up on at least this much. This woman is the girlfriend of the defendant, Phoenix Wright. But up until about eight months ago, she was with the victim, Mr. Swallow. Clearly she has some part to play in this story.Judge:\nHmm...Grossberg:\nAh, he's done it again. Before the cross-examination starts, he's already got the judge thinking like he wants.Judge:\nVery well, Mr. Payne. Please call your first witness!Payne:\nIf it pleases the court, the prosecution would like to call Mr. Phoenix Wright.Judge:\nWhat? The defendant himself? Well, Ms. Fey?Mia:\n(It's fine! After all, Mr. Wright is innocent, right?) The defense has no objection.Judge:\nVery well. The court calls Mr. Phoenix Wright to the witness stand!Payne:\nWitness, please state your name and occupation.Phoenix:\nOh, ah, yes... My name is Phoenix Wright. My job is, um... Well, right now, I guess I'm a suspect.Judge:\nNo, no. He means what did you do before you were arrested?Phoenix:\nOh... *achoo* *achoo* *achoo* I was a university student.Payne:\nMr. Wright. You understand that you are suspected in the death of your fellow student, Doug Swa--Phoenix:\nBut! But I didn't do it! I'm innocent I tell you! I'm telling you I was... *achoo* *achoo* *cough* *cough* *achoo* *cough*Judge:\nWould the defendant please refrain from passing on his cold to the rest of us!Payne:\nIt seems the witness has something he wants to say.Judge:\nHmm... Well then, Mr. Wright. Please tell us about your relation to the victim.Phoenix:\nRight away, Your Honor!Witness Testimony-- The Victim and I --Phoenix:\nUm, I... I admit I was there...\nBut I'm not a killer! All I did was find his body!\nI hardly knew the guy to begin with...\nI never even talked to that stuck-up British wannabe!Judge:\nHmm... I see. So you hardly knew the victim?Phoenix:\nRight! Like I said, I'm not a killer!Mia:\nWhew... It looks like the judge understands.Grossberg:\nMmfph... You're being na\u00efve, you know. Too na\u00efve.Mia:\nHuh...?Payne:\nHee, hee, hee, hee, hee. It seems that you've forgotten one small thing, young lady.Mia:\nAnd that would be...?Payne:\nThis witness still has to undergo something called cross-examination.Mia:\nCross-examination...?Grossberg:\nHe's right. And it's the defense's duty to carry out the cross-examination. The purpose is to determine if a witness's testimony contains any contradictions.Mia:\nContradictions...?Grossberg:\nIf a witness is lying, their statements will conflict with the Court Record.Mia:\nBut... Mr. Wright is my client!Grossberg:\nEven if he is your client, in court, all lies must be struck down. As a lawyer, that is your duty, you see.Mia:\n(What does he mean by that? Is he saying that testimony just now... That there was a lie -- a contradiction?)Judge:\nNow then, your cross-examination, if you please, Ms. Fey.Mia:\n(Please, Mr. Wright... Tell me you haven't been lying! You wouldn't do that to me... would you...?)Cross Examination-- The Victim and I --Phoenix:\nUm, I... I admit I was there...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nWhen you say \"there\", you mean the place where the victim was murdered?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, sort of. The place where SOMETHING happened anyway.\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\n\"Something\"? You can't hide what happened. We have photographic evidence.\nPhoenix:\n*achoo* *achoo* *achoo* *achoo*\nMia:\nA-Anyway, Mr. Wright... What were you doing at the scene of the crime? I thought you said you didn't know the victim, Mr. Swallow.\nPhoenix:\nIt was just a coincidence! We bumped into each other by accident.\nJudge:\nA coincidence, huh...?Phoenix:\nBut I'm not a killer! All I did was find his body!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nYou say you found the body? So who called the police?\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? Um... *achoo* *cough* *achoo* *cough* *achoo* *cough*\nPayne:\nUnfortunately it was some other students that notified the police.\nJudge:\n\"Other students\"...?\nPayne:\nThat's correct. They were witnesses. Witnesses who saw the defendant standing there, next to the body, in shock!\nJudge:\nW-What! Is this true, Mr. Wright!?\nPhoenix:\n*achoo* *achoo* *achoo* *achoo* *achoo* *achoo*\nMia:\n(Could you stop sneezing every time you're in a bind...?)\nPhoenix:\nW-Well, it's true that I was pretty shocked when I found the body. But, but I...Phoenix:\nI hardly knew the guy to begin with...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nSo, you didn't know his face, or even his name, right?\nPhoenix:\nRight! Um, well, no... That is... I mean...\nMia:\nSo... Which is it? Did you know him or not?\nPhoenix:\n*achoo* *achoo* *achoo*\nJudge:\nNow, see here! You can't avoid answering the question by sneezing all day!\nPhoenix:\nErr... Umm, well... I guess I did know his name.\nMia:\n(N-News to me! Why didn't he tell me that before...?)\nPhoenix:\nUm... I heard he used to date Dollie.\nJudge:\nWho is this \"Dollie\" person?\nPayne:\nAh yes, that would be the defendant's lover, Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne.\nJudge:\nOh, I see. Ah, young love... So bittersweet...\nPhoenix:\nBut that's all I knew about him!Phoenix:\nI never even talked to that stuck-up British wannabe!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nMr. Wright, you stated the following in your testimony: \"I hardly knew the guy to begin with...\"\nPhoenix:\nTh-That's right! I mean why would I even--\nMia:\nBut that doesn't sound right. If you hardly knew him... ...then why would you say that the victim was a \"stuck-up British wannabe\"!?\nPhoenix:\n...\nMia:\n...\nPhoenix:\n... *achoo*\nMia:\nWell, Mr. Wright!?\nPhoenix:\nAh! No! It wasn't me! I'm not a killer, I swear!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. I will give you an opportunity to revise your testimony. How is it that you knew the victim was, as you put it, a \"British wannabe\"...?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, well...\nAdds statement \"He was always walking around with a huge Union Jack on the back of his shirt.\"Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nMr. Wright, you stated the following in your testimony: \"I hardly knew the guy to begin with...\"\nPhoenix:\nTh-That's right! I mean why would I even--\nMia:\nBut that doesn't sound right. If you hardly knew him... ...then why would you say that the victim was a \"stuck-up British wannabe\"!?\nPhoenix:\nUm, well, you see...Phoenix:\nHe was always walking around with a huge Union Jack on the back of his shirt.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nDid you see it at the crime scene? The Union Jack, I mean.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, that's right! I saw it at the crime scene! That's why... That's why I figured he must love British stuff, see? It's true! Cross my heart! I swear I didn't do it...\nMia:\n(He's acting fishier than the salmon I ate last night...)\nJudge:\nMay I ask you something, Ms. Fey?\nMia:\nY-Yes, Your Honor. (What is it now?)\nJudge:\nWho is this person anyway? This \"Union Jack\" fellow...\nMia:\n...\nPayne:\nThe Union Jack is the name of the flag of England.\nJudge:\nOh, I see... So you mean like the \"Stars and Stripes\", right?\nPayne:\nAs usual, Your Honor, your insight astounds me.\nMia:\n(Hey, something just occurred to me... Isn't there something strange about this bit just now?)\nGrossberg:\nMia... There is a contradiction here!\nMia:\nM-Mr. Grossberg!\nGrossberg:\nQuickly now! Show that boy you mean business! With evidence, I mean!\nMia:\n(OK, Mia, check the Court Record carefully!)Present Crime Photo 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Are you certain you saw the \"Union Jack\"?\"Grossberg:\nWell m'dear, do you think you can manage on your own from this point?I can handle it myself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n(One year ago... I was in a courtroom just like this. I can do it. I can handle this myself!)\nGrossberg:\nMmrgh... You mustn't try to bite off more than you can chew, Mia.\nMia:\nI-I'll be fine! I know what I have to do!\nGrossberg:\nRemember, you can always press him to get more information. Oh, and one more thing. When you're going to state a contradiction, make sure you present some definitive proof.\nMia:\n(OK, Mia. One more time, from the very beginning of his testimony!)I need some help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nUmm, Mr. Grossberg... I could use a little help...\nGrossberg:\nAh, please don't look so sad. It brings a tear to my eye when you do. Alright, listen carefully. By comparing the testimony to the Court Record... ...you should be able to discover any contradictions, if there are any. And when you've found one...\nMia:\nI present the piece of evidence that contradicts the witness's testimony...?\nGrossberg:\nYes. That's the ticket!\nMia:\nBut still... I don't see any contradictions in Mr. Wright's testimony!\nGrossberg:\nHmm... Maybe you don't have enough information yet.\nMia:\nInformation...?\nGrossberg:\nYou can press for more information by leaning on a witness.\nMia:\nEven if they're my own client?\nGrossberg:\nIt doesn't matter who it is, if you think they're lying, press them like a cheap suit! That is the obligation of an attorney.\nMia:\n(OK, Mia. One more time, from the very beginning of his testimony!)Mia:\nAre you certain you saw the \"Union Jack\"?Phoenix:\nY-Yeah, I'm sure. It was right there on his back.Judge:\nMs. Fey, is there some point to this line of questioning?Mia:\nYour Honor, please take another look at the crime scene photo. As you can see, there's absolutely nothing written on the victim's back.Phoenix:\nHey! Wait a minute! He's wearing a leather jacket! The Union Jack was on the back of the t-shirt he was wearing...Mia:\nI was under the impression that you accidentally came across the body. But, if that was really the case, then you wouldn't know that, would you? You'd have no idea at all what he was wearing underneath that jacket! Mr. Wright... You've been lying to me!Phoenix:\n... P-P-P-Please forgive me! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!Grossberg:\nMia! You've made our client cry!Mia:\nLet him! That \"P\" on his chest doesn't stand for \"Phoenix\" anyways! I can't believe I trusted him! Mr. Wright was all wrong!Payne:\nHee, hee, hee, hee. That was an impressive bit of cross-examination.Mia:\n...!Payne:\nThank you for uncovering the defendant's lies for me. It's quite clear that this man did not simply \"stumble upon\" the scene of the crime!Phoenix:\nUggghhh...Mia:\n(Uh oh... Did I go too far?)Payne:\nBy the way, Mr. Wright. You seem to have a rather bad cold. Have you taken any medicine for it?Phoenix:\nI, err, umm... Yeah, I took some but...Payne:\nWas the medicine that you took an over-the-counter brand called \"Coldkiller X\"?Phoenix:\nYeah, that's right! It kills colds good! Hey, wait a second... How did you know I'm a big fan of Coldkiller X...?Payne:\nHee, hee, hee, hee... Would you happen to have that medicine with you right now?Phoenix:\nWell... Actually, I seem to have lost it somewhere...Mia:\n(He lost it? Does this even have anything to do with the case...?)Payne:\nMr. Wright... Shall I tell you where your cold medicine is right now?Phoenix:\nHuh...?Payne:\nYour Honor! I'd like you to take a look at another photo from the crime scene!Judge:\nWh-What's this! In the victim's hand, it's... It's Coldkiller X...!Mia:Mia:\nY-Yes, but even I've got a bottle of Coldkiller X in my apartment!Payne:Payne:\nI'm sorry, but I'm afraid that argument won't work. There's no doubt as to who this bottle of Coldkiller X belonged to. Especially since Mr. Wright's fingerprints were all over it!Mia:\nWh-What!?Payne:\nSensing his murderous intent, Mr. Swallow must have picked up the bottle of medicine... ...dropped by Mr. Wright and hid it in his hand. His purpose in doing so can only have been to identify his killer as Phoenix Wright!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court!Payne:\nYour Honor! I'd like to present this photo and bottle as evidence!Judge:\nVery well. The court will accept them into the record.Crime Photo 2 added to the Court Record.Coldkiller X added to the Court Record.Payne:\nAlso, the victim's wristwatch was broken.Judge:\nBroken...?Payne:\nYes, it ceased functioning when a large wave of electricity passed through it. Well, Mr. Wright! Do you have some kind of explanation for all of this!?Phoenix:\nUggghhh...Mia:\n(This is really bad...)Grossberg:\nOh, my buttocks... My poor, poor hemorrhoids...Witness Testimony-- What Really Happened --Phoenix:\nThe truth is... I went because he called me.\nHe was in the Pharmacology Dept., so we agreed to meet at 2:45 behind that building...\nWe talked for a bit, and then at around 3:00, we split up.\nThen later when I went back, I found him lying there.\nI'd been taking Coldkiller X for the last 2 or 3 days...\nBut I lost my bottle of it around lunchtime on the day of the accident.Judge:\nMr. Wright! That's completely different than the testimony you gave previously!Phoenix:\n*achoo* *achoo* *achoo* I-I'm sorry, Your Honor! I was afraid you wouldn't believe the truth!Payne:\nYou'll forgive me if I say I hardly find your current testimony any more credible.Judge:\nHmm... Ms. Fey, please begin your cross-examination.Mia:\n(Oh please, Mr. Wright... Don't tell any more lies.)Cross Examination-- What Really Happened --Phoenix:\nThe truth is... I went because he called me.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nHad you ever met the victim before then?\nPhoenix:\nNo! Never! ... But... That day, he called me up and told me he wanted to talk about Dollie.\nJudge:\nAnd this \"Dollie\" person is...?\nPhoenix:\nMy um... It's kind of embarrassing. She's my, umm, sweetheart...\nGrossberg:\nOomph...! Wh-What... What was that for, Mia!?\nMia:\nOh! I'm so sorry! I just felt like slapping something all of a sudden!\nPayne:\nDahlia Hawthorne was also the lover of the murder victim, Doug Swallow. ...Before she met Mr. Wright, that is.\nJudge:\nHmm... So it was one of those nasty love triangles, I see...Phoenix:\nHe was in the Pharmacology Dept., so we agreed to meet at 2:45 behind that building...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nWas it Mr. Swallow who indicated you should meet at 2:45?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. And we were both there right on time.\nJudge:\nHmm... You said the victim was in the Pharmacology Dept., correct?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, he was studying how to manufacture and improve pharmaceuticals. Everyone called him the \"Alchemist of Ivy U\".\nJudge:\nAn \"alchemist\"... I see...\nPhoenix:\nI gotta admit it was a little suspicious. He had a whole laboratory and everything! It was filled with chemicals and strange machines that run on high-voltage electricity.\nJudge:\nHo ho. How fascinating. He sounds like he was quite an ambitious young man.\nMia:\n(What do I do!? Maybe I should ask him for some more details?)\n\n\n\nAbout timing of the meeting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nSo you are absolutely certain that you met at 2:45?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, pretty sure. That's the time class ends. But they're always doing experiments, so it doesn't matter much.\nMia:\nExperiments...?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. Those pharmacology guys are always in the lab whipping up something.\nMia:\n(Well, it looks like he's right about the time anyway.)\nPayne:\nWitness, let's go on with your testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nAbout Pharmacology Dept.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nI was wondering if you could tell us a bit more about the Pharmacology Department.\nPhoenix:\nWell OK, sure. I don't know all that much though.\nMia:\nA little bit earlier in your testimony, you said something interesting. You said the department uses strange machines that run on high-voltage electricity.\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. And they sure look dangerous. They use non-standard voltages, so there are high-voltage cables everywhere.\nMia:\n\"High-voltage cables\"...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, there were electrical poles set up all around the building. The high-voltage cables run overhead around the roof.\nMia:\n(Finally I think we're getting somewhere...!)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nForget about it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n(I've gotten everything I need from this statement. It's time to move on.)\nPayne:\nIn any case, let's continue with your testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examinationPhoenix:\nWe talked for a bit, and then at around 3:00, we split up.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nSo what was it you were talking about?\nPhoenix:\nYou know... *achoo* *cough* That maybe we should hang out again sometime.\nMia:\n(\"Hang out again sometime\"? I wish that were true.)Phoenix:\nThen later when I went back, I found him lying there.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nSo you say you went back...\nPhoenix:\nUmm, yeah. That's when I found the body.\nMia:\nYes, but why did you go back in the first place? Weren't you angry with him?\nPhoenix:\nWell, th-that's right, I was. ...\nMia:\nThen why, Mr. Wright? Why did you go back there?\nPhoenix:\n... Umm... I thought maybe we could make up.\nMia:\n...\nPayne:\n...\nJudge:\n...\nPhoenix:\n... *achoo* *achoo*\nMia:\n(Judging by the atmosphere... I'm pretty sure no one is buying this.)Phoenix:\nI'd been taking Coldkiller X for the last 2 or 3 days...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nIt's rather unusual to catch a cold this time of the year, isn't it?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I always get a little careless when the weather starts to warm up. I guess I shouldn't sleep with the window open this early in spring, huh?\nMia:\n(I suppose common sense is not always common...) So... Did anyone else know that you were taking cold medicine?\nPhoenix:\nWell, I always took one after meals... So I'm pretty sure all my friends knew about it.Phoenix:\nBut I lost my bottle of it around lunchtime on the day of the accident.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nOn the day of the incident, what did you do for lunch...?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? What does that have to do with anything?\nMia:\nYou can never be too sure...\nPhoenix:\nI always eat with Dollie... Just the two of us. Dollie's homemade lunches are just the greatest! Mmm! Her mini-omelettes are magically delicious! Eheh heh heh.\nGrossberg:\nYeowch!! Wh-Why did you punch me in the jaw!?\nMia:\nOh! I-I'm so sorry...! I just felt like hurting someone all of a sudden!Grossberg:\nWell, Mia?Mia:\nI don't know... I can't seem to find any contradictions.Grossberg:\nThe boy isn't exactly what I'd call a natural-born liar, you know. But still, we can't have him continue to spout nonsense.Mia:\nI know... But what can I do!?Grossberg:\nWell, I'm certain he must still be hiding something. Information! Right now it's information we need more than anything else!After pressing sixth statement and selecting \"About Pharmacology Dept.\" upon pressing second statement:Judge:\nI think that's enough for now. So the defendant and the victim met at approximately the time of his death. And then the defendant returned to the scene for some unknown reason.Payne:\nI'm not entirely convinced by his explanation about the medicine bottle either.Judge:\nLet me be frank here, Mr. Wright. Your testimony cannot be trusted.Phoenix:\nWh-What do you mean!?Payne:\nHee, hee, hee, hee... I knew it was too much work for a little girl.Mia:\nHmph...!Judge:\nHowever, there is one mystery that still remains.Payne:\nThere is, Your Honor?Judge:\nHow the murder was carried out, of course. Just how was the victim electrocuted? I don't believe the murder weapon has been produced yet, correct?Payne:\nWell, that is... I... You are correct, Your Honor.Mia:\n(So how exactly was Mr. Swallow killed...? If I could somehow establish how it was done... Maybe I could still come out of this mess smelling like a rose!)Establish murder method\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor!\"Can't right now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n(Hmm, I do have one idea, but it would be impossible to prove it.)\nGrossberg:\nMia, m'dear. If you have any ideas, now is the time to present them.\nMia:\nMr. Grossberg!\nGrossberg:\nRemember, silence is NOT golden. ...In court, anyway.\nMia:\n(Silence is not golden, huh? Well in that case...)\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor!\"Mia:\nYour Honor!Judge:\nY-Yes, Ms. Fey?Mia:\nI believe that if we were to piece together everything we've heard up until now... ...we should be able to solve the mystery of how Mr. Swallow died.Judge:\nTh-That would be most impressive!Payne:\nHee, hee, hee, hee... Quite the brash statement coming from a rookie! But even a beginner like you must understand the basic rules of the court, yes? An attorney must be able to substantiate their arguments with evidence!Mia:\nHmph! Of course I know that! (Actually, I had totally forgotten about that...)Judge:\nNow then, Ms. Fey. Let me see what you've got. Show me how you believe the victim was electrocuted!Present Crime Photo 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"As for the cause of death...\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nJudge:\nMs. Fey, I'm deeply disappointed in you.\nPayne:\nI'm disappointed as well, Ms. Fey.\nGrossberg:\nTo be honest, I'm a bit disappointed too, Mia.\nPhoenix:\n... *achoo*\nMia:\n(Argh! I need to use my brain on this! Come on, Mia! You can't strike out here!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Now then, Ms. Fey. Let me see what you've got.\"Mia:\nAs for the cause of death... ...I'd say this picture captures it quite well!Judge:\nWh-What!? But there is nothing that even remotely resembles a murder weapon here... Hmm, I'm afraid the defense is going to have to explain this in a bit more detail. Ms. Fey, where exactly in this photo is the murder weapon?Present downed power line\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Well, naturally... it's right here!\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nWell naturally... it's right around here! ...I think.\nJudge:\nMs. Fey, I'm deeply disappointed in you.\nPayne:\nI'm disappointed as well, Ms. Fey.\nGrossberg:\nTo be honest, I'm a bit disappointed too, Mia.\nPhoenix:\n... *achoo*\nMia:\n(Argh!

You can't strike out here!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Ms. Fey, where exactly in this photo is the murder weapon?\"Mia:\nWell, naturally... it's right here!Judge:\nThat's... That's... What is that?Mia:\nA severed electrical cable, I believe... Your Honor. Remember the testimony we've heard. The machines the pharmacology students use in their experiments require high voltage... ...and because of that, there are special high-voltage cables strung up everywhere!Judge:\nSo then, the high-voltage cable...!Mia:\nYes, the high-voltage cable is the cause of death. That is the most likely explanation!Judge:\nHmm... That certainly sounds plausible. Well, Mr. Payne? What do you have to say about this?Payne:\nWell... I believe some praise is in order.Mia:\nDon't toy with me, old man!Payne:\nNow, now. The victim's cause of death may indeed have been a high-voltage cable. However! I want you to think about what that really implies! The only one who had the opportunity to use the cable as a murder weapon was... The defendant!Phoenix:\n... *achoo*Judge:\nHmm... That much is certainly true.Payne:\nYes, and that's not all. We have proof. Irrefutable proof that will establish that Mr. Wright was the murderer.Judge:\nY-You do!? Well, what is it!?Payne:\nHis fingerprints.Judge:\nFingerprints...? You mean that the defendant's fingerprints were on something besides the medicine bottle?Payne:\nLet's take another look at the crime scene photo. As you can see, the victim is wearing a leather jacket. And as you may know, leather holds fingerprints quite well.Mia:\nAh! Y-You mean...?Payne:\nYes. It was quite clearly imprinted on the chest area of the victim's jacket. The palm print of the defendant's very own hand!Judge:\nWh-Whaaat!?Payne:\nI can only think of one way Mr. Wright could have left a print like that. Intent on murder, he squarely pushed the victim towards the severed electrical cable!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! That's enough! I think we can conclude that there is no reason to continue with this cross-examination.Grossberg:\nStick a fork in us, we're done.Mia:\nM-Mr. Grossberg!Grossberg:\nMy hemorrhoids never lie. The show is over, Mia. I knew that boy was guilty the first time I saw him.Mia:\nN-No! You're wrong! Mr. Wright is innocent.Judge:\nNo further evidence is required to convince me of this man's guilt!Mia:\nY-Your Honor...!Judge:\nAt this time, I am prepared to render a verdict in this case!Mia:Judge:\nDo you have something further to add, Ms. Fey?Mia:\nIs this what you want, Mr. Wright!?Phoenix:\n...!Mia:\nYou still haven't told us the truth... the whole truth. If you don't say something now, the judge is going to hand down his verdict!Phoenix:\nB-But I... I can't! I-I just can't say it! If I told you what really happened, then I'd b-be...Mia:\nIt's OK, Mr. Wright. I'm your attorney. You can trust me.Phoenix:\nM-Miss Fey...Mia:\nNo matter what it is you have to say... I believe in you and I'll represent you to the very end.Phoenix:\n...!Payne:Payne:\nWe've already established the defendant's guilt. There's no further need for him to say anything.Phoenix:\n*cough* *cough* W-Wait a minute!Mia:\nMr. Wright...Phoenix:\nI... I'll tell you what really happened!Payne:Payne:\nBut I've already told you, Mr. Wright. There's no need for further...Phoenix:\n*cough* I-I-I... I did it... I admit it! I pushed him! It's my fault... My f-fault that D-Doug Swallow is dead!That girl... You shouldn't see her anymore.Hey! It's none of your business!I'm telling you for your sake. If you continue to see her, it's going to be bad news.Y-You're lying!Just listen to me. There's something you need to know about that girl......Stop it! D-Don't talk about her like that!Judge:\n... What you just said... Was that the truth!?Phoenix:\nY-Yes, I... I was afraid... Afraid that if I told the truth... ...everyone would think I was the murderer for sure!Judge:\nWell, as things currently stand, we're all absolutely convinced you are!Phoenix:\nP-Please...! Please give me one more chance to explain! This time I swear... I swear I'll tell the whole truth! It'll be OK, won't it, Miss Fey? I... I believe in you!Mia:\nOh! Um, th-thank you. (I still can't believe it... He really did push the victim...)Grossberg:\nUnnngh... It feels like my hemorrhoids are doing the Harlem Shake!Witness Testimony-- When I Pushed The Victim --Phoenix:\nThat guy... He was talking bad about Dollie...\nI lost my temper and gave him a shove!\nAt that moment, I heard some kind of loud noise...\nA little while after I left, I started to get worried.\nSo I went back. But h-he was just lying there, d-dead!Payne:\nWell, the explanation is really quite simple. When you pushed him, Mr. Swallow flew back and touched the electrical cable. He died from the shock. And that, as they say, is that.Judge:\nHmm... A simple explanation indeed.Payne:\nAt the time of the incident, a light rain had been falling. Wet from the rain, the victim was more easily electrocuted.Phoenix:\nB-But! When I pushed him, there weren't any electrical cables nearby! If there had been something like that, even I would've noticed it!Mia:\n(That's true... Even a dufus like him couldn't miss that!)Judge:\nHmm... Ms. Fey. Let me warn you right now that if your cross-examination doesn't yield any new facts... ...I intend to deliver my verdict without further delay. Are we clear on that?Mia:\nY-Yes, Your Honor. (Don't give up, Mia! If he is innocent, there must be some kind of evidence somewhere that will prove it!)Cross Examination-- When I Pushed The Victim --Phoenix:\nThat guy... He was talking bad about Dollie...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nSo what kinds of things did Mr. Swallow say to you?\nPhoenix:\nHe said all sorts of terrible things about Dollie! He said that she was a bad girl!\nPayne:\n...\nMia:\n...\nJudge:\n... Umm... Is that all?\nPhoenix:\nYup!\nJudge:\nWell, Ms. Fey, you heard him yourself.\nMia:\n(Oh boy! You're not doing yourself any favors here, Mr. Wright! Please don't make this harder for me than it already is!)\nPhoenix:\nAnyway... After he said that, I just, I just...Phoenix:\nI lost my temper and gave him a shove!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nCan you tell me about what happened in a little more detail?\nPhoenix:\nThat guy... He just said what he wanted to say to me... And then he put on the jacket he was holding and started to leave. That's when... That's when I lost my temper and flew into a furious frenzy! I just gave him a... light, gentle shove to the chest.\nMia:\nAnd when you did that, there was no severed cable anywhere to be seen?\nPhoenix:\nRight! There was nothing like that at all!\nPayne:\nBut is it possible that you merely overlooked it?\nPhoenix:\n... Well, I guess it's possible.\nMia:\n(What are you doing!? Don't let that guy steamroll over you like cheap asphalt!)\nJudge:\nI believe what's important here is the moment the push occurred. Let's continue on with the testimony, witness.Phoenix:\nAt that moment, I heard some kind of loud noise...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nA \"loud noise\"? And what would you say that loud noise was, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nI'm not sure... But it was really loud! It was like, \"SNAP!\"... You know, come to think of it, I wonder what that was...\nPayne:\nHee, hee, hee, hee... Clearly, Your Honor, it was the sound of the victim being electrocuted.\nMia:\n\nMia:\nY-You're not qualified to decide that! (What should I do? I'm treading on some dangerous ground here...)\n\n\n\nAsk for more details\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nMr. Wright, that \"loud noise\" you heard may be extremely important. So try to remember what it was!\nPhoenix:\nUmm, how do I put it... It was like a sharp crack. Aha! Could it... Could it have been...?\nMia:\nYes? Could it have been? Hurry up and tell us!\nPhoenix:\nWhen I pushed him, he dropped the umbrella he was holding. He fell right on top of it, and it broke. That was probably the noise I heard.\nJudge:\nAn umbrella, huh? And did that umbrella belong to the victim?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, it was a plastic umbrella. Cheap and frail, kind of like the owner! Then again, I wish I had any kind of umbrella. I was totally soaked to the bone.\nJudge:\nHmm... Ms. Fey. What do you think? Is there something important in that testimony just now?\nMia:\nUmm, well...\n\n\n\nOf course it's important!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n(This is it, Mia! The new information you've been waiting for!) Of course it's important! No! This cheap umbrella is more than important; it's vital! I want to officially have it entered into the testimony!\nPayne:\nHa! How perfectly fitting. Flimsy information for a flimsy lawyer!\nJudge:\nThe court agrees to the defense's request. Witness, please add the bit about the cheap umbrella to your testimony.\nChanges statement from \"At that moment, I heard some kind of loud noise...\" to \"After I shoved him, he... He fell down on top of his cheap umbrella.\"\n\n\n\n\nOf course it's not important!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nOf course it's not important!\nJudge:\nM-Ms. Fey! How can you state that so proudly!?\nMia:\nWell, it just isn't! It's not important one bit! Not even one iota. OK?\nGrossberg:\nMia! That's enough! You're making a fool of yourself!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Is it OK if I go on?\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave it alone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n(I've got other, more pressing things to ask about.) Very well, Mr. Wright, let's move on, shall we?\nLeads back to cross-examinationPhoenix:\nAfter I shoved him, he... He fell down on top of his cheap umbrella.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nSo Mr. Swallow fell on top of his umbrella? And you are certain of this?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. It was right there under him. Actually, if it hadn't been under him, I was planning on borrowing it for myself.\nMia:\nThe umbrella, you mean?\nPhoenix:\nWell yeah, you see I was wearing this sweater here... Dollie stayed up late for nights at a time knitting it for me... I didn't want the rain to dampen the handmade symbol of her love...\nGrossberg:\nOomph! My stomach is not to be used as your personal soccer ball, Mia!\nMia:\nAh! I-I'm so sorry!\nJudge:\nContinue on with your testimony, witness.Present Crime Photo 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Why didn't you testify about the umbrella from the very beginning?\"Phoenix:\nA little while after I left, I started to get worried.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nAfter you shoved the victim, did you leave the scene right away?\nPhoenix:\nYes, I did! I admit it! I-I was furious!\nPayne:\nYou left without even checking Mr. Swallow's condition?\nPhoenix:\nWell, um, yeah... But like I said, I got worried about him later.Phoenix:\nSo I went back. But h-he was just lying there, d-dead!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nAt that time, did you see anyone else at the scene of the crime?\nPhoenix:\n*cough* *cough*... *cough* *cough* *cough* Um, nope. Nobody...\nMia:\n(Geez. Could that stupid cough possibly sound any phonier?)\nJudge:\nHmm... In that case, it's very hard to believe someone else could have been the murderer...Grossberg:\nUnless we can find something that shows his innocence from that testimony, m'dear... I'm afraid the judge will make his final decision with no remorse whatsoever!Mia:\nY-Yes, sir! (Right now I need more info; info that will help me turn up some contradictions!)Mia:\nWhy didn't you testify about the umbrella from the very beginning?Phoenix:\nCome on... If I had mentioned that...Mia:\nI would've been able to counter the prosecution's arguments earlier!Payne:\nWh-What do you mean by that?Mia:\nTake another look at the crime scene photo! According to Mr. Wright, the victim fell on top of his umbrella. However, if you look closely... ...the umbrella is nowhere near the victim. Actually, it's by the electrical pole!Judge:\nY-You're absolutely right!Mia:\nThe conclusion here is obvious. After the defendant left, the victim moved from where he fell. In other words... After he was pushed by the defendant, Mr. Swallow was still alive!Payne:\nNnnnooooo!!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! The victim... He moved...!? Mr. Payne! The umbrella in this photo... Where is it now?Payne:\nW-Well, it was collected by the police at the crime scene...Judge:\nI want it presented as evidence immediately!Umbrella added to the Court Record.Payne:\nB-But the umbrella could have simply been blown there by the wind!Mia:Mia:\nAccording to the testimony, the victim fell on top of the umbrella. There's simply no way it could have been blown there by the wind!Payne:\nNnn... Gggg... Hrrmph! B-B-But...!Judge:\nI know this matter of the umbrella seems relatively trivial... But as long as the smallest doubt remains, I cannot render final judgment!Payne:\nN-N-N... Noooooooooooooooooooooo!!!Judge:\nI must say, I still find it hard to believe... (Changed from [However, I still find it hard to believe that a huge hole has been blown in the...] in the original release) that a huge hole has been blown in the prosecution's case by the defendant's testimony. (Changed from [...prosecution's case by the defendant's testimony.] in the original release)Phoenix's Testimony added to the Court Record.Grossberg:\nWell done, Mia!Payne:\n......Hee hee. Hee hee hee hee hee...Judge:\nMr. Payne! What are you chuckling about?Payne:\nPardon me, Your Honor. It seems I was expecting too much of a free ride. It was foolish to think I could establish guilt through cross-examination alone.Judge:\nI'm afraid I don't follow what you're saying!Mia:\n... Let me guess. You have another witness.Payne:\nExactly! And this witness's testimony will be incontrovertible!Judge:\nWell!? Who is this witness!?Payne:\nMs. Dahlia Hawthorne.Judge:\nDahlia Hawthorne? You don't mean... \"Dollie\"?Payne:\nI do, Your Honor. The defendant's very own lover is a witness to the whole thing! That's right. She was at the scene of the crime when the murder took place!Judge:\nWhaaaat!?Payne:\nI'm sorry to break the bad news to you, my dear.Mia:\n... \"Bad news\"? You couldn't be more wrong. Actually... I've been waiting for this.Payne:\nYou can't be serious...Grossberg:\nMia! What do you mean by that...?Judge:\nI think this is a good point for us to stop at. Court will now enter a 20 minute recess. Afterwards, we will listen to the testimony of Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne.April 11, 11:52 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3Phoenix:\nMiss Fey... I-I'm sorry about what happened back there... I... I...Mia:\nIt's alright. At least you told us the truth in the end, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nYeah... So I guess I can start to relax then, huh?Grossberg:\nRelax, my boy? You can't be serious! After hiding such important facts...Phoenix:\nB-But...! But the next witness is my Dollie, right? She'll save me! I just know she will!Mia:\nWhy do you think that?Phoenix:\nHuh!? What do you mean!? She... She's the love of my life, that's why!Mia:\nThe love of your life, huh... Would you mind telling me more about you and... Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne?Phoenix:\nSure! No problem! Dollie and I... We first met about eight months ago right here in this very courthouse. Actually, I'm studying to be a lawyer, on the side... Anyway! One day, she and I just bumped into each other in the reading room downstairs. That's why I really think it was fate that brought us together. As soon as I first set eyes on her, I knew she was the one for me. Oh, here! Take a look at this!Mia:\n...!Phoenix:\nShe gave this to me the day we met as a symbol of our love! She had been wearing it around her neck that day, but then... ...she took it off, but before she gave it to me she said, \"I want you to carry this.\"Grossberg:\nSo she gave it to you as a present, I see.Phoenix:\nThis darling little bottle is filled with memories of my darling little Dollie!Mia:\nIt certainly is a little bottle alright.Phoenix:\nIt makes me so happy, I show it to everyone I meet! I want to share my happiness with the whole world!Dahlia's Present borrowed from Phoenix Wright.Mia:\nUm, anyway... So after that, you and Ms. Hawthorne started dating?Phoenix:\nYeah, but she's so shy. Every time I see her, she always says the same thing to me. \"Please give it back now.\"Grossberg:\nWhat a strange girl, asking for a present back like that...Mia:\nBy the way, Mr. Wright. The day you first met Dahlia Hawthorne, eight months ago... It wouldn't happen to have been on August 27th, would it?Phoenix:\nHuh...? Y-Yeah, it was... But how did you...?Mia:\nThis happened on August 27th, right here in this courthouse.Phoenix:\nWhat's this? A newspaper clipping? Let's see... \"Murder in the Courthouse?\" M-Murder?Grossberg:\nWhat are you reading there!? Let me see that! .........! Oh, I see. Mia... I think I understand what you're trying to say. And I think I understand why you suddenly took such a keen interest in this case. You believe there is some connection between these two cases. Am I correct? (Changed from [You believe there is some relationship between these two cases. Am I correct?] in the original release)Newspaper Clipping added to the Court Record.Mia:\nI hope you don't mind, Mr. Grossberg... I... I need to finish this myself.Grossberg:\nAh, yes, but... I'm afraid what you have will not be enough, m'dear. I'll go and have a look at the downstairs reading room and see what else I can find.Mia:\nTh-Thank you!Grossberg:\nI want to do whatever I can to be of help to you, Mia! Well, it looks like recess is about over. We'd better all get moving!Mia:\n(I guess so... That recess sure seemed longer than 20 minutes though...)To be continued.April 11, 12:13 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt will now reconvene. Mr. Payne, please call your witness.Payne:\nThis next person is someone who witnessed the crime as it happened. The prosecution calls Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne to the stand!Payne:\n...Judge:\n...Mia:\n(Wh-What's with this stiff silence...?)Judge:\nIn my long career as a judge, I have been deceived by many witnesses. It's my job to doubt; to take no one at their word... But in your case, I must admit that you radiate a glow of complete sincerity.Mia:\n(I can't believe he actually said that!)Payne:\nOh! Um, now then, witness. Could you please state your full name?Dahlia:\n... I, umm...Judge:\nDon't worry, sweetie. There's no need to be nervous!Payne:\nIf anyone says anything rude, you can be sure, I'll cut them right down to size!Judge:\nAnd I will bash them with my gavel!Mia:\n(I love how they look straight at me when they say that...)Dahlia:\nUm, thank you... for calming my nerves. You are all so nice... I almost feel right at home.Payne:\nNot at all!Judge:\nIt was nothing!Mia:\nIf we may move on now... What is your full name and occupation?Dahlia:\nMy name is Dahlia Hawthorne. I'm a junior in Literature at Ivy University. I just want to say... It's an honor for me to be here in your noble presence.Payne:\nThe honor is all mine!Judge:\nNo... The honor is all mine.Mia:\n(Well, we know whose milkshake brings all the boys to the yard...)Dahlia:\n...Umm. Sir?Payne:\nIs there something I can help you with?Judge:\nYou just go on and say whatever is on your mind!Dahlia:\nI'm sure that there must be some kind of mistake. Feenie wouldn't kill anyone. I just know it!Judge:\nYes, yes... I can see why you'd say that.Mia:\n(She's going to be a tough witness, alright... It only took her 12 seconds to wrap them all around her little finger.)Judge:\nNow then, please proceed with your testimony. Let's hear about what you witnessed on the day of the incident, if you please.Witness Testimony-- What I Witnessed --Dahlia:\nI had been planning to go back to Feenie's place after class was over.\nFeenie and Dougie... They were talking behind the building.\nThen suddenly... Dougie got all wobbly and just collapsed.\nThat's when Feenie noticed that I was there.\nI went to go and find some other students and they called the authorities.Judge:\nI-I don't know what to say! According to you, Ms. Hawthorne... ...the defendant didn't do anything wrong!Payne:Payne:\nYoung lady. As old as I am, even I recall how hot the flames of young passion can burn. Nevertheless... It is my job to discover the truth. Please, tell us the truth...Dahlia:\nBut... But, I... I would never...Mia:Mia:\nThat's more than enough, witness. I won't allow this to continue.Judge:\nWh-What do you mean by that?Mia:\nPlease, just let me proceed with my cross-examination, Your Honor. I, for one, don't plan to win my case on a bunch of paper-thin lies!Dahlia:\n...Tee hee. You haven't changed a bit... Mia Fey.Mia:\n...Payne:\nWhat's this? So, you two are... acquainted?Mia:\nYes. We've met before... Once.Dahlia:\n...Judge:\nIn any case, Ms. Fey, the floor is all yours.Dahlia:\nIt's good to see you again, Madame Fey!Mia:\n\"Madame\"!?

Afterwards, we will listen to the testimony of Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne.April 11, 11:52 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3Phoenix:\nMiss Fey... I-I'm sorry about what happened back there... I... I...Mia:\nIt's alright. At least you told us the truth in the end, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nYeah... So I guess I can start to relax then, huh?Grossberg:\nRelax, my boy? You can't be serious! After hiding such important facts...Phoenix:\nB-But...! But the next witness is my Dollie, right? She'll save me! I just know she will!Mia:\nWhy do you think that?Phoenix:\nHuh!? What do you mean!? She... She's the love of my life, that's why!Mia:\nThe love of your life, huh... Would you mind telling me more about you and... Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne?Phoenix:\nSure! No problem! Dollie and I... We first met about eight months ago right here in this very courthouse. Actually, I'm studying to be a lawyer, on the side... Anyway! One day, she and I just bumped into each other in the reading room downstairs. That's why I really think it was fate that brought us together. As soon as I first set eyes on her, I knew she was the one for me. Oh, here! Take a look at this!Mia:\n...!Phoenix:\nShe gave this to me the day we met as a symbol of our love! She had been wearing it around her neck that day, but then... ...she took it off, but before she gave it to me she said, \"I want you to carry this.\"Grossberg:\nSo she gave it to you as a present, I see.Phoenix:\nThis darling little bottle is filled with memories of my darling little Dollie!Mia:\nIt certainly is a little bottle alright.Phoenix:\nIt makes me so happy, I show it to everyone I meet! I want to share my happiness with the whole world!Dahlia's Present borrowed from Phoenix Wright.Mia:\nUm, anyway... So after that, you and Ms. Hawthorne started dating?Phoenix:\nYeah, but she's so shy. Every time I see her, she always says the same thing to me. \"Please give it back now.\"Grossberg:\nWhat a strange girl, asking for a present back like that...Mia:\nBy the way, Mr. Wright. The day you first met Dahlia Hawthorne, eight months ago... It wouldn't happen to have been on August 27th, would it?Phoenix:\nHuh...? Y-Yeah, it was... But how did you...?Mia:\nThis happened on August 27th, right here in this courthouse.Phoenix:\nWhat's this? A newspaper clipping? Let's see... \"Murder in the Courthouse?\" M-Murder?Grossberg:\nWhat are you reading there!? Let me see that! .........! Oh, I see. Mia... I think I understand what you're trying to say. And I think I understand why you suddenly took such a keen interest in this case. You believe there is some connection between these two cases. Am I correct? (Changed from [You believe there is some relationship between these two cases. Am I correct?] in the original release)Newspaper Clipping added to the Court Record.Mia:\nI hope you don't mind, Mr. Grossberg... I... I need to finish this myself.Grossberg:\nAh, yes, but... I'm afraid what you have will not be enough, m'dear. I'll go and have a look at the downstairs reading room and see what else I can find.Mia:\nTh-Thank you!Grossberg:\nI want to do whatever I can to be of help to you, Mia! Well, it looks like recess is about over. We'd better all get moving!Mia:\n(I guess so... That recess sure seemed longer than 20 minutes though...)To be continued.April 11, 12:13 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt will now reconvene. Mr. Payne, please call your witness.Payne:\nThis next person is someone who witnessed the crime as it happened. The prosecution calls Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne to the stand!Payne:\n...Judge:\n...Mia:\n(Wh-What's with this stiff silence...?)Judge:\nIn my long career as a judge, I have been deceived by many witnesses. It's my job to doubt; to take no one at their word... But in your case, I must admit that you radiate a glow of complete sincerity.Mia:\n(I can't believe he actually said that!)Payne:\nOh! Um, now then, witness. Could you please state your full name?Dahlia:\n... I, umm...Judge:\nDon't worry, sweetie. There's no need to be nervous!Payne:\nIf anyone says anything rude, you can be sure, I'll cut them right down to size!Judge:\nAnd I will bash them with my gavel!Mia:\n(I love how they look straight at me when they say that...)Dahlia:\nUm, thank you... for calming my nerves. You are all so nice... I almost feel right at home.Payne:\nNot at all!Judge:\nIt was nothing!Mia:\nIf we may move on now... What is your full name and occupation?Dahlia:\nMy name is Dahlia Hawthorne. I'm a junior in Literature at Ivy University. I just want to say... It's an honor for me to be here in your noble presence.Payne:\nThe honor is all mine!Judge:\nNo... The honor is all mine.Mia:\n(Well, we know whose milkshake brings all the boys to the yard...)Dahlia:\n...Umm. Sir?Payne:\nIs there something I can help you with?Judge:\nYou just go on and say whatever is on your mind!Dahlia:\nI'm sure that there must be some kind of mistake. Feenie wouldn't kill anyone. I just know it!Judge:\nYes, yes... I can see why you'd say that.Mia:\n(She's going to be a tough witness, alright... It only took her 12 seconds to wrap them all around her little finger.)Judge:\nNow then, please proceed with your testimony. Let's hear about what you witnessed on the day of the incident, if you please.Witness Testimony-- What I Witnessed --Dahlia:\nI had been planning to go back to Feenie's place after class was over.\nFeenie and Dougie... They were talking behind the building.\nThen suddenly... Dougie got all wobbly and just collapsed.\nThat's when Feenie noticed that I was there.\nI went to go and find some other students and they called the authorities.Judge:\nI-I don't know what to say! According to you, Ms. Hawthorne... ...the defendant didn't do anything wrong!Payne:Payne:\nYoung lady. As old as I am, even I recall how hot the flames of young passion can burn. Nevertheless... It is my job to discover the truth. Please, tell us the truth...Dahlia:\nBut... But, I... I would never...Mia:Mia:\nThat's more than enough, witness. I won't allow this to continue.Judge:\nWh-What do you mean by that?Mia:\nPlease, just let me proceed with my cross-examination, Your Honor. I, for one, don't plan to win my case on a bunch of paper-thin lies!Dahlia:\n...Tee hee. You haven't changed a bit... Mia Fey.Mia:\n...Payne:\nWhat's this? So, you two are... acquainted?Mia:\nYes. We've met before... Once.Dahlia:\n...Judge:\nIn any case, Ms. Fey, the floor is all yours.Dahlia:\nIt's good to see you again, Madame Fey!Mia:\n\"Madame\"!?

Why did I do that...?That girl... You shouldn't see her anymore.Hey! It's none of your business!I'm telling you for your sake. If you continue to see her, it's going to be bad news.Y-You're lying!Just listen to me. There's something you need to know about that girl... ...Stop it! D-Don't talk about her like that!It-It wasn't me! I-I d-didn't... I didn't do it!-- Five Years Earlier --Mia FeySecond TrialApril 11, 9:40 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3Mia:\n(Whew, it's finally time... I'm kind of nervous...)???:\n*Ah-HHHHEM!*Mia:\nOh! Mr. Grossberg! Good morning!Grossberg:\nAh, Mia. Please calm yourself down! You're going to get yourself arrested for suspicious behavior, you know.Mia:\nWhat are you talking about!! I am relaxed, Mr. Grossberg!! Look at me, I'm relaxed!!Grossberg:\n*Grrrmmphh* L-Let go of my lapels! Hmph... You obviously haven't got the temperament to be a lawyer.Mia:\nI, err... I'm so sorry! It's just that I'm so nervous today...Grossberg:\nOh, that's right. This is your first time in the big leagues, isn't it? Well, never you fear my dear. I, Marvin Grossberg, am at your service!Mia:\nUmm, actually this is my second time in court...Grossberg:\nStill, you surprised me... What, with your earnest request last night... \"Let me handle this case!\" you suddenly said. And quite forcefully, too!Mia:\nI just found out yesterday. About the case, I mean.Grossberg:\nWhat? And you've already learned all the relevant facts?Mia:\nWell about that... You see... I mean, of course I have! I think.Grossberg:\nOh dear... In any case, don't let our client see you're so nervous. You see the poor young man in the pink sweater over there? That's our client.Phoenix:\n*cough* *sniffle* Good morning there everybody!Mia:\nGood morning... (Try to keep smiling, Mia!)Phoenix:\nI, err, I just want to say... I'll give it all I've got! Yup, it'll be fine! No prob! *cough* *achoo* *achoo*Mia:\nOh, what's wrong? Do you have a cold or something... Mr. Wry?Phoenix:\nActually, it's Wright... Like the flying brothers... People screw it up all the time. And yes I have a cold. That's what this mask is for. My doc says this way, I won't give it to anyone else... Be kind to others, he says...Mia:\nRight, Mr. Wright! You have nothing to fear in court today! If you are truly innocent... I promise I will save you!Phoenix:\nNnnnggghh... P-Please l-let go of my shirt... *cough*Mia:\n(That's right, he's the one on trial, not you! He's the one who should be nervous! You need to stay strong for your client, Mia!)Mia:\nMy name is Mia Fey. I'm still pretty new at this lawyer thing... The first time I appeared in court was a year ago. But that trial traumatized me so badly, I thought I'd never set foot in another courtroom. It's been one year since then, and well, here I am again. But this time... This time I'm going to win. (Changed from [But this time... This time I'll win.] in the original release) For my client... And for myself.April 11, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Phoenix Wright.Mia:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor!Payne:\nThe prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Judge:\nThe defense today is... Ms... Ms... Mia Fey, was it?Mia:\nY-Yes, Your Honor. Is there a problem?Judge:\nI was under the impression that Marvin Grossberg was to be leading the defense.Mia:\nYes! Well, you see... Mr. Grossberg had... A-A bit of an emergency...Judge:\nEmergency? But isn't that him standing there right next to you?Mia:\nYes, well...Judge:\nYou... You're just a rookie. Are you sure you can really handle this?Mia:\n(Don't let him scare you, Mia! Give him your toughest look!) Of course, Your Honor! ... I think.Judge:\nHmm... Well, Mr. Payne. Your opening statement, please.Payne:\nWell, well, well... I can't believe a veteran like me has to spend his time baby-sitting a new defense lawyer.Mia:\n...!Payne:\nDon't worry little girl. It will all be over soon.Mia:\n(What was that all about? Was he trying to trash-talk me?)Payne:\nNow then, I'd like to proceed with a summary of events on the day in question. The incident occurred on the campus of Ivy University. The murder victim was a student named Doug Swallow. He was a fourth year student studying Pharmacology.Judge:\nHmm... It sounds like he was a very bright young man.Payne:\nYes, well, next we have a photo taken at the scene of the crime. Students discovered the scene shortly after the murder. They found the victim's body... ...and the defendant, who had obviously bungled his getaway. They then called the police.Judge:\nHmm... That certainly makes the defendant look very suspicious indeed. Very well. The court accepts this photo into the record as evidence.Crime Photo 1 added to the Court Record.Judge:\nBy the way... I can't quite tell the cause of death from this photo.Payne:\nHee, hee, hee... Your reputation for sagacity is well-earned, Your Honor. The truth is that this victim died a rather unusual death.Mia:\nAn unusual death...!?Judge:\nWhat do you mean, Mr. Payne!?Payne:\nWell... Perhaps the defense would like to take this question.Mia:\nHuh...!?Payne:\nA simple question. I thought I might loosen you up a bit. I am a genteel-man, if you will.Mia:\nUm, a what? (Stand up to him, Mia! Show him what you're made of!)Grossberg:\nAh, a perfect opportunity! Well, what was it? The cause! Go on! ... ...Please say you know at least this much.Mia:\nI-I'm so sorry... I-I didn't get a chance to read through the whole file.Grossberg:\n*groan* My hemorrhoids are beginning to act up... Now see here! The details of the case are filed under the Court Record. But you knew that already, didn't you?Mia:\n(Ah! The Court Record! I think I can see that by pressing [the R Button / Tab]...) (Changed from [Ah! The Court Record! I think I can see that by touching the Court Record Button...] in the original release)Grossberg:\nAll of the weapons we need can be found in the Court Record. Take a good, hard look at the data there and think carefully before you answer, m'dear!Mia:\nY-Yes, sir! I'll do just that! (I've got to stay calm! I can't let that prosecutor get the better of me! The Court Record... OK, let's take a look! I just press [the R Button / Tab] here... (Changed from [The Court Record... OK, let's take a look! I just touch the Court Record Button here...] in the original release))Judge:\nNow then, would the attorney for the defense please answer the question? What was the cause of death?Asphyxiation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nWell... I think you'll find it was a case of asphyxiation.\nJudge:\nHmm... Asphyxiation, huh?\nGrossberg:\nM-Mia! What are you doing!? (Changed from [M-Mia! What are you saying!?] in the original release)\nMia:\nWell, it's stuffy in here! I can hardly breathe.\nGrossberg:\nNo one's asking how you feel! Please, make sure to properly read the Court Record!\nMia:\nI-I'm so sorry! I'll take a better look! (Hang in there, Mia! Okay! The Court Record is [the R Button / Tab]...) (Changed from [Hang in there, Mia! Open the Court Record with the Court Record Button...] in the original release)\nJudge:\nHmm... I'll ask you once again.\nLeads back to:\n\"What was the cause of death?\"Electrocution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"According to the Court Record, it was a fatal electric shock. In other words, electrocution.\"Hypothermia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nErr... Hypothermia, I believe.\n... ... ......\nMia:\nUmm, Mr. Grossberg? Does it suddenly feel very cold in here to you?\nGrossberg:\nThat's because your absurd reply has brought a chill to the courtroom!\nMia:\nI-I'm so sorry...\nGrossberg:\nLook at the Court Record more carefully, would you! How can you expect to win a case this way!?\nMia:\n(Hang in there, Mia! Okay! The Court Record is [the R Button / Tab]...) (Changed from [Hang in there, Mia! Open the Court Record with the Court Record Button...] in the original release)\nJudge:\nHmm... I'll ask you once again.\nLeads back to:\n\"What was the cause of death?\"Mia:\nAccording to the Court Record, it was a fatal electric shock. In other words, electrocution.Judge:\nElectrocution? Hmm... But how could such a thing happen? Did the murderer use some type of new, super-powerful stun-gun, perhaps?Payne:\nThe answer to that will become crystal clear as this trial proceeds, Your Honor. But before that, there is one more vital issue.Mia:\nWh-What's that?Payne:\nWhy, motive of course. Apparently there was some bad blood between the victim and the defendant.Judge:\nBad blood...?Mia:\nWh-What do you mean...?Payne:\nOopsie! I'm terribly sorry. You're the defense attorney, so you must know all about it. I shouldn't be stealing your spotlight like this.Mia:\n(I really don't like this guy's smug attitude...)Grossberg:\nThat's Winston Payne for you. He is one smooth operator, if you catch my drift. They don't call him the \"Rookie Killer\" for nothing, you know.Judge:\nNow then, let's hear from the defense. What was the source of the bad blood between the victim and the defendant? And this time, I would like to see some supporting evidence!Mia:\nEv-Evidence...?Grossberg:\nAh, no need to get all worked up over this. As I said, all our weapons can be found in the Court Record. Find the evidence you need and then shove it into Ol' Graybeard's face!Mia:\nY-Yes, sir! Into Ol' Graybeard's face!Judge:\nErr, Mr. Grossberg. Try to set a better example for the young lady!Grossberg:\nMia, evidence isn't the only thing in the Court Record. People's profiles are as well. You can toggle between Profiles and Evidence with [the R Button / Tab], so be sure to go over it all! (Changed from [You can toggle between Profiles and Evidence, so be sure to go over it all!] in the original release)Judge:\nNow then, let's see what you've got. What was the cause of the bad blood between Phoenix Wright and the victim?Present Dahlia Hawthorne profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The reason for the bad blood between the two of them was... this woman here.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nJudge:\nMr. Grossberg... I honestly think it would be best for the defense if you were in charge. I'm afraid Ms. Fey might stir up some bad blood with this court if she were to continue.\nGrossberg:\nOr simply put, you are quite mistaken, m'dear.\nMia:\nOh no... I'm so sorry...\nJudge:\nEven if you are new, your lack of preparation is inexcusable. Now take a moment and think it over again.\nMia:\nY-Yes, Your Honor! (It's OK! You've got another chance, Mia!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Mia, evidence isn't the only thing in the Court Record.\"Mia:\nThe reason for the bad blood between the two of them was... this woman here.Judge:\nDahlia Hawthorne, is it?Payne:\nVery good, Ms. Fey. You seem to have picked up on at least this much. This woman is the girlfriend of the defendant, Phoenix Wright. But up until about eight months ago, she was with the victim, Mr. Swallow. Clearly she has some part to play in this story.Judge:\nHmm...Grossberg:\nAh, he's done it again. Before the cross-examination starts, he's already got the judge thinking like he wants.Judge:\nVery well, Mr. Payne. Please call your first witness!Payne:\nIf it pleases the court, the prosecution would like to call Mr. Phoenix Wright.Judge:\nWhat? The defendant himself? Well, Ms. Fey?Mia:\n(It's fine! After all, Mr. Wright is innocent, right?) The defense has no objection.Judge:\nVery well. The court calls Mr. Phoenix Wright to the witness stand!Payne:\nWitness, please state your name and occupation.Phoenix:\nOh, ah, yes... My name is Phoenix Wright. My job is, um... Well, right now, I guess I'm a suspect.Judge:\nNo, no. He means what did you do before you were arrested?Phoenix:\nOh... *achoo* *achoo* *achoo* I was a university student.Payne:\nMr. Wright. You understand that you are suspected in the death of your fellow student, Doug Swa--Phoenix:\nBut! But I didn't do it! I'm innocent I tell you! I'm telling you I was... *achoo* *achoo* *cough* *cough* *achoo* *cough*Judge:\nWould the defendant please refrain from passing on his cold to the rest of us!Payne:\nIt seems the witness has something he wants to say.Judge:\nHmm... Well then, Mr. Wright. Please tell us about your relation to the victim.Phoenix:\nRight away, Your Honor!Witness Testimony-- The Victim and I --Phoenix:\nUm, I... I admit I was there...\nBut I'm not a killer! All I did was find his body!\nI hardly knew the guy to begin with...\nI never even talked to that stuck-up British wannabe!Judge:\nHmm... I see. So you hardly knew the victim?Phoenix:\nRight! Like I said, I'm not a killer!Mia:\nWhew... It looks like the judge understands.Grossberg:\nMmfph... You're being na\u00efve, you know. Too na\u00efve.Mia:\nHuh...?Payne:\nHee, hee, hee, hee, hee. It seems that you've forgotten one small thing, young lady.Mia:\nAnd that would be...?Payne:\nThis witness still has to undergo something called cross-examination.Mia:\nCross-examination...?Grossberg:\nHe's right. And it's the defense's duty to carry out the cross-examination. The purpose is to determine if a witness's testimony contains any contradictions.Mia:\nContradictions...?Grossberg:\nIf a witness is lying, their statements will conflict with the Court Record.Mia:\nBut... Mr. Wright is my client!Grossberg:\nEven if he is your client, in court, all lies must be struck down. As a lawyer, that is your duty, you see.Mia:\n(What does he mean by that? Is he saying that testimony just now... That there was a lie -- a contradiction?)Judge:\nNow then, your cross-examination, if you please, Ms. Fey.Mia:\n(Please, Mr. Wright... Tell me you haven't been lying! You wouldn't do that to me... would you...?)Cross Examination-- The Victim and I --Phoenix:\nUm, I... I admit I was there...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nWhen you say \"there\", you mean the place where the victim was murdered?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, sort of. The place where SOMETHING happened anyway.\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\n\"Something\"? You can't hide what happened. We have photographic evidence.\nPhoenix:\n*achoo* *achoo* *achoo* *achoo*\nMia:\nA-Anyway, Mr. Wright... What were you doing at the scene of the crime? I thought you said you didn't know the victim, Mr. Swallow.\nPhoenix:\nIt was just a coincidence! We bumped into each other by accident.\nJudge:\nA coincidence, huh...?Phoenix:\nBut I'm not a killer! All I did was find his body!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nYou say you found the body? So who called the police?\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? Um... *achoo* *cough* *achoo* *cough* *achoo* *cough*\nPayne:\nUnfortunately it was some other students that notified the police.\nJudge:\n\"Other students\"...?\nPayne:\nThat's correct. They were witnesses. Witnesses who saw the defendant standing there, next to the body, in shock!\nJudge:\nW-What! Is this true, Mr. Wright!?\nPhoenix:\n*achoo* *achoo* *achoo* *achoo* *achoo* *achoo*\nMia:\n(Could you stop sneezing every time you're in a bind...?)\nPhoenix:\nW-Well, it's true that I was pretty shocked when I found the body. But, but I...Phoenix:\nI hardly knew the guy to begin with...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nSo, you didn't know his face, or even his name, right?\nPhoenix:\nRight! Um, well, no... That is... I mean...\nMia:\nSo... Which is it? Did you know him or not?\nPhoenix:\n*achoo* *achoo* *achoo*\nJudge:\nNow, see here! You can't avoid answering the question by sneezing all day!\nPhoenix:\nErr... Umm, well... I guess I did know his name.\nMia:\n(N-News to me! Why didn't he tell me that before...?)\nPhoenix:\nUm... I heard he used to date Dollie.\nJudge:\nWho is this \"Dollie\" person?\nPayne:\nAh yes, that would be the defendant's lover, Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne.\nJudge:\nOh, I see. Ah, young love... So bittersweet...\nPhoenix:\nBut that's all I knew about him!Phoenix:\nI never even talked to that stuck-up British wannabe!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nMr. Wright, you stated the following in your testimony: \"I hardly knew the guy to begin with...\"\nPhoenix:\nTh-That's right! I mean why would I even--\nMia:\nBut that doesn't sound right. If you hardly knew him... ...then why would you say that the victim was a \"stuck-up British wannabe\"!?\nPhoenix:\n...\nMia:\n...\nPhoenix:\n... *achoo*\nMia:\nWell, Mr. Wright!?\nPhoenix:\nAh! No! It wasn't me! I'm not a killer, I swear!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. I will give you an opportunity to revise your testimony. How is it that you knew the victim was, as you put it, a \"British wannabe\"...?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, well...\nAdds statement \"He was always walking around with a huge Union Jack on the back of his shirt.\"Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nMr. Wright, you stated the following in your testimony: \"I hardly knew the guy to begin with...\"\nPhoenix:\nTh-That's right! I mean why would I even--\nMia:\nBut that doesn't sound right. If you hardly knew him... ...then why would you say that the victim was a \"stuck-up British wannabe\"!?\nPhoenix:\nUm, well, you see...Phoenix:\nHe was always walking around with a huge Union Jack on the back of his shirt.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nDid you see it at the crime scene? The Union Jack, I mean.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, that's right! I saw it at the crime scene! That's why... That's why I figured he must love British stuff, see? It's true! Cross my heart! I swear I didn't do it...\nMia:\n(He's acting fishier than the salmon I ate last night...)\nJudge:\nMay I ask you something, Ms. Fey?\nMia:\nY-Yes, Your Honor. (What is it now?)\nJudge:\nWho is this person anyway? This \"Union Jack\" fellow...\nMia:\n...\nPayne:\nThe Union Jack is the name of the flag of England.\nJudge:\nOh, I see... So you mean like the \"Stars and Stripes\", right?\nPayne:\nAs usual, Your Honor, your insight astounds me.\nMia:\n(Hey, something just occurred to me... Isn't there something strange about this bit just now?)\nGrossberg:\nMia... There is a contradiction here!\nMia:\nM-Mr. Grossberg!\nGrossberg:\nQuickly now! Show that boy you mean business! With evidence, I mean!\nMia:\n(OK, Mia, check the Court Record carefully!)Present Crime Photo 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Are you certain you saw the \"Union Jack\"?\"Grossberg:\nWell m'dear, do you think you can manage on your own from this point?I can handle it myself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n(One year ago... I was in a courtroom just like this. I can do it. I can handle this myself!)\nGrossberg:\nMmrgh... You mustn't try to bite off more than you can chew, Mia.\nMia:\nI-I'll be fine! I know what I have to do!\nGrossberg:\nRemember, you can always press him to get more information. Oh, and one more thing. When you're going to state a contradiction, make sure you present some definitive proof.\nMia:\n(OK, Mia. One more time, from the very beginning of his testimony!)I need some help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nUmm, Mr. Grossberg... I could use a little help...\nGrossberg:\nAh, please don't look so sad. It brings a tear to my eye when you do. Alright, listen carefully. By comparing the testimony to the Court Record... ...you should be able to discover any contradictions, if there are any. And when you've found one...\nMia:\nI present the piece of evidence that contradicts the witness's testimony...?\nGrossberg:\nYes. That's the ticket!\nMia:\nBut still... I don't see any contradictions in Mr. Wright's testimony!\nGrossberg:\nHmm... Maybe you don't have enough information yet.\nMia:\nInformation...?\nGrossberg:\nYou can press for more information by leaning on a witness.\nMia:\nEven if they're my own client?\nGrossberg:\nIt doesn't matter who it is, if you think they're lying, press them like a cheap suit! That is the obligation of an attorney.\nMia:\n(OK, Mia. One more time, from the very beginning of his testimony!)Mia:\nAre you certain you saw the \"Union Jack\"?Phoenix:\nY-Yeah, I'm sure. It was right there on his back.Judge:\nMs. Fey, is there some point to this line of questioning?Mia:\nYour Honor, please take another look at the crime scene photo. As you can see, there's absolutely nothing written on the victim's back.Phoenix:\nHey! Wait a minute! He's wearing a leather jacket! The Union Jack was on the back of the t-shirt he was wearing...Mia:\nI was under the impression that you accidentally came across the body. But, if that was really the case, then you wouldn't know that, would you? You'd have no idea at all what he was wearing underneath that jacket! Mr. Wright... You've been lying to me!Phoenix:\n... P-P-P-Please forgive me! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!Grossberg:\nMia! You've made our client cry!Mia:\nLet him! That \"P\" on his chest doesn't stand for \"Phoenix\" anyways! I can't believe I trusted him! Mr. Wright was all wrong!Payne:\nHee, hee, hee, hee. That was an impressive bit of cross-examination.Mia:\n...!Payne:\nThank you for uncovering the defendant's lies for me. It's quite clear that this man did not simply \"stumble upon\" the scene of the crime!Phoenix:\nUggghhh...Mia:\n(Uh oh... Did I go too far?)Payne:\nBy the way, Mr. Wright. You seem to have a rather bad cold. Have you taken any medicine for it?Phoenix:\nI, err, umm... Yeah, I took some but...Payne:\nWas the medicine that you took an over-the-counter brand called \"Coldkiller X\"?Phoenix:\nYeah, that's right! It kills colds good! Hey, wait a second... How did you know I'm a big fan of Coldkiller X...?Payne:\nHee, hee, hee, hee... Would you happen to have that medicine with you right now?Phoenix:\nWell... Actually, I seem to have lost it somewhere...Mia:\n(He lost it? Does this even have anything to do with the case...?)Payne:\nMr. Wright... Shall I tell you where your cold medicine is right now?Phoenix:\nHuh...?Payne:\nYour Honor! I'd like you to take a look at another photo from the crime scene!Judge:\nWh-What's this! In the victim's hand, it's... It's Coldkiller X...!Mia:Mia:\nY-Yes, but even I've got a bottle of Coldkiller X in my apartment!Payne:Payne:\nI'm sorry, but I'm afraid that argument won't work. There's no doubt as to who this bottle of Coldkiller X belonged to. Especially since Mr. Wright's fingerprints were all over it!Mia:\nWh-What!?Payne:\nSensing his murderous intent, Mr. Swallow must have picked up the bottle of medicine... ...dropped by Mr. Wright and hid it in his hand. His purpose in doing so can only have been to identify his killer as Phoenix Wright!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court!Payne:\nYour Honor! I'd like to present this photo and bottle as evidence!Judge:\nVery well. The court will accept them into the record.Crime Photo 2 added to the Court Record.Coldkiller X added to the Court Record.Payne:\nAlso, the victim's wristwatch was broken.Judge:\nBroken...?Payne:\nYes, it ceased functioning when a large wave of electricity passed through it. Well, Mr. Wright! Do you have some kind of explanation for all of this!?Phoenix:\nUggghhh...Mia:\n(This is really bad...)Grossberg:\nOh, my buttocks... My poor, poor hemorrhoids...Witness Testimony-- What Really Happened --Phoenix:\nThe truth is... I went because he called me.\nHe was in the Pharmacology Dept., so we agreed to meet at 2:45 behind that building...\nWe talked for a bit, and then at around 3:00, we split up.\nThen later when I went back, I found him lying there.\nI'd been taking Coldkiller X for the last 2 or 3 days...\nBut I lost my bottle of it around lunchtime on the day of the accident.Judge:\nMr. Wright! That's completely different than the testimony you gave previously!Phoenix:\n*achoo* *achoo* *achoo* I-I'm sorry, Your Honor! I was afraid you wouldn't believe the truth!Payne:\nYou'll forgive me if I say I hardly find your current testimony any more credible.Judge:\nHmm... Ms. Fey, please begin your cross-examination.Mia:\n(Oh please, Mr. Wright... Don't tell any more lies.)Cross Examination-- What Really Happened --Phoenix:\nThe truth is... I went because he called me.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nHad you ever met the victim before then?\nPhoenix:\nNo! Never! ... But... That day, he called me up and told me he wanted to talk about Dollie.\nJudge:\nAnd this \"Dollie\" person is...?\nPhoenix:\nMy um... It's kind of embarrassing. She's my, umm, sweetheart...\nGrossberg:\nOomph...! Wh-What... What was that for, Mia!?\nMia:\nOh! I'm so sorry! I just felt like slapping something all of a sudden!\nPayne:\nDahlia Hawthorne was also the lover of the murder victim, Doug Swallow. ...Before she met Mr. Wright, that is.\nJudge:\nHmm... So it was one of those nasty love triangles, I see...Phoenix:\nHe was in the Pharmacology Dept., so we agreed to meet at 2:45 behind that building...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nWas it Mr. Swallow who indicated you should meet at 2:45?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. And we were both there right on time.\nJudge:\nHmm... You said the victim was in the Pharmacology Dept., correct?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, he was studying how to manufacture and improve pharmaceuticals. Everyone called him the \"Alchemist of Ivy U\".\nJudge:\nAn \"alchemist\"... I see...\nPhoenix:\nI gotta admit it was a little suspicious. He had a whole laboratory and everything! It was filled with chemicals and strange machines that run on high-voltage electricity.\nJudge:\nHo ho. How fascinating. He sounds like he was quite an ambitious young man.\nMia:\n(What do I do!? Maybe I should ask him for some more details?)\n\n\n\nAbout timing of the meeting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nSo you are absolutely certain that you met at 2:45?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, pretty sure. That's the time class ends. But they're always doing experiments, so it doesn't matter much.\nMia:\nExperiments...?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. Those pharmacology guys are always in the lab whipping up something.\nMia:\n(Well, it looks like he's right about the time anyway.)\nPayne:\nWitness, let's go on with your testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nAbout Pharmacology Dept.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nI was wondering if you could tell us a bit more about the Pharmacology Department.\nPhoenix:\nWell OK, sure. I don't know all that much though.\nMia:\nA little bit earlier in your testimony, you said something interesting. You said the department uses strange machines that run on high-voltage electricity.\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. And they sure look dangerous. They use non-standard voltages, so there are high-voltage cables everywhere.\nMia:\n\"High-voltage cables\"...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, there were electrical poles set up all around the building. The high-voltage cables run overhead around the roof.\nMia:\n(Finally I think we're getting somewhere...!)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nForget about it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n(I've gotten everything I need from this statement. It's time to move on.)\nPayne:\nIn any case, let's continue with your testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examinationPhoenix:\nWe talked for a bit, and then at around 3:00, we split up.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nSo what was it you were talking about?\nPhoenix:\nYou know... *achoo* *cough* That maybe we should hang out again sometime.\nMia:\n(\"Hang out again sometime\"? I wish that were true.)Phoenix:\nThen later when I went back, I found him lying there.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nSo you say you went back...\nPhoenix:\nUmm, yeah. That's when I found the body.\nMia:\nYes, but why did you go back in the first place? Weren't you angry with him?\nPhoenix:\nWell, th-that's right, I was. ...\nMia:\nThen why, Mr. Wright? Why did you go back there?\nPhoenix:\n... Umm... I thought maybe we could make up.\nMia:\n...\nPayne:\n...\nJudge:\n...\nPhoenix:\n... *achoo* *achoo*\nMia:\n(Judging by the atmosphere... I'm pretty sure no one is buying this.)Phoenix:\nI'd been taking Coldkiller X for the last 2 or 3 days...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nIt's rather unusual to catch a cold this time of the year, isn't it?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I always get a little careless when the weather starts to warm up. I guess I shouldn't sleep with the window open this early in spring, huh?\nMia:\n(I suppose common sense is not always common...) So... Did anyone else know that you were taking cold medicine?\nPhoenix:\nWell, I always took one after meals... So I'm pretty sure all my friends knew about it.Phoenix:\nBut I lost my bottle of it around lunchtime on the day of the accident.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nOn the day of the incident, what did you do for lunch...?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? What does that have to do with anything?\nMia:\nYou can never be too sure...\nPhoenix:\nI always eat with Dollie... Just the two of us. Dollie's homemade lunches are just the greatest! Mmm! Her mini-omelettes are magically delicious! Eheh heh heh.\nGrossberg:\nYeowch!! Wh-Why did you punch me in the jaw!?\nMia:\nOh! I-I'm so sorry...! I just felt like hurting someone all of a sudden!Grossberg:\nWell, Mia?Mia:\nI don't know... I can't seem to find any contradictions.Grossberg:\nThe boy isn't exactly what I'd call a natural-born liar, you know. But still, we can't have him continue to spout nonsense.Mia:\nI know... But what can I do!?Grossberg:\nWell, I'm certain he must still be hiding something. Information! Right now it's information we need more than anything else!After pressing sixth statement and selecting \"About Pharmacology Dept.\" upon pressing second statement:Judge:\nI think that's enough for now. So the defendant and the victim met at approximately the time of his death. And then the defendant returned to the scene for some unknown reason.Payne:\nI'm not entirely convinced by his explanation about the medicine bottle either.Judge:\nLet me be frank here, Mr. Wright. Your testimony cannot be trusted.Phoenix:\nWh-What do you mean!?Payne:\nHee, hee, hee, hee... I knew it was too much work for a little girl.Mia:\nHmph...!Judge:\nHowever, there is one mystery that still remains.Payne:\nThere is, Your Honor?Judge:\nHow the murder was carried out, of course. Just how was the victim electrocuted? I don't believe the murder weapon has been produced yet, correct?Payne:\nWell, that is... I... You are correct, Your Honor.Mia:\n(So how exactly was Mr. Swallow killed...? If I could somehow establish how it was done... Maybe I could still come out of this mess smelling like a rose!)Establish murder method\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor!\"Can't right now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n(Hmm, I do have one idea, but it would be impossible to prove it.)\nGrossberg:\nMia, m'dear. If you have any ideas, now is the time to present them.\nMia:\nMr. Grossberg!\nGrossberg:\nRemember, silence is NOT golden. ...In court, anyway.\nMia:\n(Silence is not golden, huh? Well in that case...)\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor!\"Mia:\nYour Honor!Judge:\nY-Yes, Ms. Fey?Mia:\nI believe that if we were to piece together everything we've heard up until now... ...we should be able to solve the mystery of how Mr. Swallow died.Judge:\nTh-That would be most impressive!Payne:\nHee, hee, hee, hee... Quite the brash statement coming from a rookie! But even a beginner like you must understand the basic rules of the court, yes? An attorney must be able to substantiate their arguments with evidence!Mia:\nHmph! Of course I know that! (Actually, I had totally forgotten about that...)Judge:\nNow then, Ms. Fey. Let me see what you've got. Show me how you believe the victim was electrocuted!Present Crime Photo 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"As for the cause of death...\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nJudge:\nMs. Fey, I'm deeply disappointed in you.\nPayne:\nI'm disappointed as well, Ms. Fey.\nGrossberg:\nTo be honest, I'm a bit disappointed too, Mia.\nPhoenix:\n... *achoo*\nMia:\n(Argh! I need to use my brain on this! Come on, Mia! You can't strike out here!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Now then, Ms. Fey. Let me see what you've got.\"Mia:\nAs for the cause of death... ...I'd say this picture captures it quite well!Judge:\nWh-What!? But there is nothing that even remotely resembles a murder weapon here... Hmm, I'm afraid the defense is going to have to explain this in a bit more detail. Ms. Fey, where exactly in this photo is the murder weapon?Present downed power line\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Well, naturally... it's right here!\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nWell naturally... it's right around here! ...I think.\nJudge:\nMs. Fey, I'm deeply disappointed in you.\nPayne:\nI'm disappointed as well, Ms. Fey.\nGrossberg:\nTo be honest, I'm a bit disappointed too, Mia.\nPhoenix:\n... *achoo*\nMia:\n(Argh! I need to use my brain on this! Come on, Mia! You can't strike out here!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Ms. Fey, where exactly in this photo is the murder weapon?\"Mia:\nWell, naturally... it's right here!Judge:\nThat's... That's... What is that?Mia:\nA severed electrical cable, I believe... Your Honor. Remember the testimony we've heard. The machines the pharmacology students use in their experiments require high voltage... ...and because of that, there are special high-voltage cables strung up everywhere!Judge:\nSo then, the high-voltage cable...!Mia:\nYes, the high-voltage cable is the cause of death. That is the most likely explanation!Judge:\nHmm... That certainly sounds plausible. Well, Mr. Payne? What do you have to say about this?Payne:\nWell... I believe some praise is in order.Mia:\nDon't toy with me, old man!Payne:\nNow, now. The victim's cause of death may indeed have been a high-voltage cable. However! I want you to think about what that really implies! The only one who had the opportunity to use the cable as a murder weapon was... The defendant!Phoenix:\n... *achoo*Judge:\nHmm... That much is certainly true.Payne:\nYes, and that's not all. We have proof. Irrefutable proof that will establish that Mr. Wright was the murderer.Judge:\nY-You do!? Well, what is it!?Payne:\nHis fingerprints.Judge:\nFingerprints...? You mean that the defendant's fingerprints were on something besides the medicine bottle?Payne:\nLet's take another look at the crime scene photo. As you can see, the victim is wearing a leather jacket. And as you may know, leather holds fingerprints quite well.Mia:\nAh! Y-You mean...?Payne:\nYes. It was quite clearly imprinted on the chest area of the victim's jacket. The palm print of the defendant's very own hand!Judge:\nWh-Whaaat!?Payne:\nI can only think of one way Mr. Wright could have left a print like that. Intent on murder, he squarely pushed the victim towards the severed electrical cable!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! That's enough! I think we can conclude that there is no reason to continue with this cross-examination.Grossberg:\nStick a fork in us, we're done.Mia:\nM-Mr. Grossberg!Grossberg:\nMy hemorrhoids never lie. The show is over, Mia. I knew that boy was guilty the first time I saw him.Mia:\nN-No! You're wrong! Mr. Wright is innocent.Judge:\nNo further evidence is required to convince me of this man's guilt!Mia:\nY-Your Honor...!Judge:\nAt this time, I am prepared to render a verdict in this case!Mia:Judge:\nDo you have something further to add, Ms. Fey?Mia:\nIs this what you want, Mr. Wright!?Phoenix:\n...!Mia:\nYou still haven't told us the truth... the whole truth. If you don't say something now, the judge is going to hand down his verdict!Phoenix:\nB-But I... I can't! I-I just can't say it! If I told you what really happened, then I'd b-be...Mia:\nIt's OK, Mr. Wright. I'm your attorney. You can trust me.Phoenix:\nM-Miss Fey...Mia:\nNo matter what it is you have to say... I believe in you and I'll represent you to the very end.Phoenix:\n...!Payne:Payne:\nWe've already established the defendant's guilt. There's no further need for him to say anything.Phoenix:\n*cough* *cough* W-Wait a minute!Mia:\nMr. Wright...Phoenix:\nI... I'll tell you what really happened!Payne:Payne:\nBut I've already told you, Mr. Wright. There's no need for further...Phoenix:\n*cough* I-I-I... I did it... I admit it! I pushed him! It's my fault... My f-fault that D-Doug Swallow is dead!That girl... You shouldn't see her anymore.Hey! It's none of your business!I'm telling you for your sake. If you continue to see her, it's going to be bad news.Y-You're lying!Just listen to me. There's something you need to know about that girl......Stop it! D-Don't talk about her like that!Judge:\n... What you just said... Was that the truth!?Phoenix:\nY-Yes, I... I was afraid... Afraid that if I told the truth... ...everyone would think I was the murderer for sure!Judge:\nWell, as things currently stand, we're all absolutely convinced you are!Phoenix:\nP-Please...! Please give me one more chance to explain! This time I swear... I swear I'll tell the whole truth! It'll be OK, won't it, Miss Fey? I... I believe in you!Mia:\nOh! Um, th-thank you. (I still can't believe it... He really did push the victim...)Grossberg:\nUnnngh... It feels like my hemorrhoids are doing the Harlem Shake!Witness Testimony-- When I Pushed The Victim --Phoenix:\nThat guy... He was talking bad about Dollie...\nI lost my temper and gave him a shove!\nAt that moment, I heard some kind of loud noise...\nA little while after I left, I started to get worried.\nSo I went back. But h-he was just lying there, d-dead!Payne:\nWell, the explanation is really quite simple. When you pushed him, Mr. Swallow flew back and touched the electrical cable. He died from the shock. And that, as they say, is that.Judge:\nHmm... A simple explanation indeed.Payne:\nAt the time of the incident, a light rain had been falling. Wet from the rain, the victim was more easily electrocuted.Phoenix:\nB-But! When I pushed him, there weren't any electrical cables nearby! If there had been something like that, even I would've noticed it!Mia:\n(That's true... Even a dufus like him couldn't miss that!)Judge:\nHmm... Ms. Fey. Let me warn you right now that if your cross-examination doesn't yield any new facts... ...I intend to deliver my verdict without further delay. Are we clear on that?Mia:\nY-Yes, Your Honor. (Don't give up, Mia! If he is innocent, there must be some kind of evidence somewhere that will prove it!)Cross Examination-- When I Pushed The Victim --Phoenix:\nThat guy... He was talking bad about Dollie...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nSo what kinds of things did Mr. Swallow say to you?\nPhoenix:\nHe said all sorts of terrible things about Dollie! He said that she was a bad girl!\nPayne:\n...\nMia:\n...\nJudge:\n... Umm... Is that all?\nPhoenix:\nYup!\nJudge:\nWell, Ms. Fey, you heard him yourself.\nMia:\n(Oh boy! You're not doing yourself any favors here, Mr. Wright! Please don't make this harder for me than it already is!)\nPhoenix:\nAnyway... After he said that, I just, I just...Phoenix:\nI lost my temper and gave him a shove!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nCan you tell me about what happened in a little more detail?\nPhoenix:\nThat guy... He just said what he wanted to say to me... And then he put on the jacket he was holding and started to leave. That's when... That's when I lost my temper and flew into a furious frenzy! I just gave him a... light, gentle shove to the chest.\nMia:\nAnd when you did that, there was no severed cable anywhere to be seen?\nPhoenix:\nRight! There was nothing like that at all!\nPayne:\nBut is it possible that you merely overlooked it?\nPhoenix:\n... Well, I guess it's possible.\nMia:\n(What are you doing!? Don't let that guy steamroll over you like cheap asphalt!)\nJudge:\nI believe what's important here is the moment the push occurred. Let's continue on with the testimony, witness.Phoenix:\nAt that moment, I heard some kind of loud noise...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nA \"loud noise\"? And what would you say that loud noise was, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nI'm not sure... But it was really loud! It was like, \"SNAP!\"... You know, come to think of it, I wonder what that was...\nPayne:\nHee, hee, hee, hee... Clearly, Your Honor, it was the sound of the victim being electrocuted.\nMia:\n\nMia:\nY-You're not qualified to decide that! (What should I do? I'm treading on some dangerous ground here...)\n\n\n\nAsk for more details\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nMr. Wright, that \"loud noise\" you heard may be extremely important. So try to remember what it was!\nPhoenix:\nUmm, how do I put it... It was like a sharp crack. Aha! Could it... Could it have been...?\nMia:\nYes? Could it have been? Hurry up and tell us!\nPhoenix:\nWhen I pushed him, he dropped the umbrella he was holding. He fell right on top of it, and it broke. That was probably the noise I heard.\nJudge:\nAn umbrella, huh? And did that umbrella belong to the victim?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, it was a plastic umbrella. Cheap and frail, kind of like the owner! Then again, I wish I had any kind of umbrella. I was totally soaked to the bone.\nJudge:\nHmm... Ms. Fey. What do you think? Is there something important in that testimony just now?\nMia:\nUmm, well...\n\n\n\nOf course it's important!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n(This is it, Mia! The new information you've been waiting for!) Of course it's important! No! This cheap umbrella is more than important; it's vital! I want to officially have it entered into the testimony!\nPayne:\nHa! How perfectly fitting. Flimsy information for a flimsy lawyer!\nJudge:\nThe court agrees to the defense's request. Witness, please add the bit about the cheap umbrella to your testimony.\nChanges statement from \"At that moment, I heard some kind of loud noise...\" to \"After I shoved him, he... He fell down on top of his cheap umbrella.\"\n\n\n\n\nOf course it's not important!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nOf course it's not important!\nJudge:\nM-Ms. Fey! How can you state that so proudly!?\nMia:\nWell, it just isn't! It's not important one bit! Not even one iota. OK?\nGrossberg:\nMia! That's enough! You're making a fool of yourself!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Is it OK if I go on?\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave it alone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n(I've got other, more pressing things to ask about.) Very well, Mr. Wright, let's move on, shall we?\nLeads back to cross-examinationPhoenix:\nAfter I shoved him, he... He fell down on top of his cheap umbrella.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nSo Mr. Swallow fell on top of his umbrella? And you are certain of this?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. It was right there under him. Actually, if it hadn't been under him, I was planning on borrowing it for myself.\nMia:\nThe umbrella, you mean?\nPhoenix:\nWell yeah, you see I was wearing this sweater here... Dollie stayed up late for nights at a time knitting it for me... I didn't want the rain to dampen the handmade symbol of her love...\nGrossberg:\nOomph! My stomach is not to be used as your personal soccer ball, Mia!\nMia:\nAh! I-I'm so sorry!\nJudge:\nContinue on with your testimony, witness.Present Crime Photo 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Why didn't you testify about the umbrella from the very beginning?\"Phoenix:\nA little while after I left, I started to get worried.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nAfter you shoved the victim, did you leave the scene right away?\nPhoenix:\nYes, I did! I admit it! I-I was furious!\nPayne:\nYou left without even checking Mr. Swallow's condition?\nPhoenix:\nWell, um, yeah... But like I said, I got worried about him later.Phoenix:\nSo I went back. But h-he was just lying there, d-dead!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nAt that time, did you see anyone else at the scene of the crime?\nPhoenix:\n*cough* *cough*... *cough* *cough* *cough* Um, nope. Nobody...\nMia:\n(Geez. Could that stupid cough possibly sound any phonier?)\nJudge:\nHmm... In that case, it's very hard to believe someone else could have been the murderer...Grossberg:\nUnless we can find something that shows his innocence from that testimony, m'dear... I'm afraid the judge will make his final decision with no remorse whatsoever!Mia:\nY-Yes, sir! (Right now I need more info; info that will help me turn up some contradictions!)Mia:\nWhy didn't you testify about the umbrella from the very beginning?Phoenix:\nCome on... If I had mentioned that...Mia:\nI would've been able to counter the prosecution's arguments earlier!Payne:\nWh-What do you mean by that?Mia:\nTake another look at the crime scene photo! According to Mr. Wright, the victim fell on top of his umbrella. However, if you look closely... ...the umbrella is nowhere near the victim. Actually, it's by the electrical pole!Judge:\nY-You're absolutely right!Mia:\nThe conclusion here is obvious. After the defendant left, the victim moved from where he fell. In other words... After he was pushed by the defendant, Mr. Swallow was still alive!Payne:\nNnnnooooo!!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! The victim... He moved...!? Mr. Payne! The umbrella in this photo... Where is it now?Payne:\nW-Well, it was collected by the police at the crime scene...Judge:\nI want it presented as evidence immediately!Umbrella added to the Court Record.Payne:\nB-But the umbrella could have simply been blown there by the wind!Mia:Mia:\nAccording to the testimony, the victim fell on top of the umbrella. There's simply no way it could have been blown there by the wind!Payne:\nNnn... Gggg... Hrrmph! B-B-But...!Judge:\nI know this matter of the umbrella seems relatively trivial... But as long as the smallest doubt remains, I cannot render final judgment!Payne:\nN-N-N... Noooooooooooooooooooooo!!!Judge:\nI must say, I still find it hard to believe... (Changed from [However, I still find it hard to believe that a huge hole has been blown in the...] in the original release) that a huge hole has been blown in the prosecution's case by the defendant's testimony. (Changed from [...prosecution's case by the defendant's testimony.] in the original release)Phoenix's Testimony added to the Court Record.Grossberg:\nWell done, Mia!Payne:\n......Hee hee. Hee hee hee hee hee...Judge:\nMr. Payne! What are you chuckling about?Payne:\nPardon me, Your Honor. It seems I was expecting too much of a free ride. It was foolish to think I could establish guilt through cross-examination alone.Judge:\nI'm afraid I don't follow what you're saying!Mia:\n... Let me guess. You have another witness.Payne:\nExactly! And this witness's testimony will be incontrovertible!Judge:\nWell!? Who is this witness!?Payne:\nMs. Dahlia Hawthorne.Judge:\nDahlia Hawthorne? You don't mean... \"Dollie\"?Payne:\nI do, Your Honor. The defendant's very own lover is a witness to the whole thing! That's right. She was at the scene of the crime when the murder took place!Judge:\nWhaaaat!?Payne:\nI'm sorry to break the bad news to you, my dear.Mia:\n... \"Bad news\"? You couldn't be more wrong. Actually... I've been waiting for this.Payne:\nYou can't be serious...Grossberg:\nMia! What do you mean by that...?Judge:\nI think this is a good point for us to stop at. Court will now enter a 20 minute recess. Afterwards, we will listen to the testimony of Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne.April 11, 11:52 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3Phoenix:\nMiss Fey... I-I'm sorry about what happened back there... I... I...Mia:\nIt's alright. At least you told us the truth in the end, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nYeah... So I guess I can start to relax then, huh?Grossberg:\nRelax, my boy? You can't be serious! After hiding such important facts...Phoenix:\nB-But...! But the next witness is my Dollie, right? She'll save me! I just know she will!Mia:\nWhy do you think that?Phoenix:\nHuh!? What do you mean!? She... She's the love of my life, that's why!Mia:\nThe love of your life, huh... Would you mind telling me more about you and... Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne?Phoenix:\nSure! No problem! Dollie and I... We first met about eight months ago right here in this very courthouse. Actually, I'm studying to be a lawyer, on the side... Anyway! One day, she and I just bumped into each other in the reading room downstairs. That's why I really think it was fate that brought us together. As soon as I first set eyes on her, I knew she was the one for me. Oh, here! Take a look at this!Mia:\n...!Phoenix:\nShe gave this to me the day we met as a symbol of our love! She had been wearing it around her neck that day, but then... ...she took it off, but before she gave it to me she said, \"I want you to carry this.\"Grossberg:\nSo she gave it to you as a present, I see.Phoenix:\nThis darling little bottle is filled with memories of my darling little Dollie!Mia:\nIt certainly is a little bottle alright.Phoenix:\nIt makes me so happy, I show it to everyone I meet! I want to share my happiness with the whole world!Dahlia's Present borrowed from Phoenix Wright.Mia:\nUm, anyway... So after that, you and Ms. Hawthorne started dating?Phoenix:\nYeah, but she's so shy. Every time I see her, she always says the same thing to me. \"Please give it back now.\"Grossberg:\nWhat a strange girl, asking for a present back like that...Mia:\nBy the way, Mr. Wright. The day you first met Dahlia Hawthorne, eight months ago... It wouldn't happen to have been on August 27th, would it?Phoenix:\nHuh...? Y-Yeah, it was... But how did you...?Mia:\nThis happened on August 27th, right here in this courthouse.Phoenix:\nWhat's this? A newspaper clipping? Let's see... \"Murder in the Courthouse?\" M-Murder?Grossberg:\nWhat are you reading there!? Let me see that! .........! Oh, I see. Mia... I think I understand what you're trying to say. And I think I understand why you suddenly took such a keen interest in this case. You believe there is some connection between these two cases. Am I correct? (Changed from [You believe there is some relationship between these two cases. Am I correct?] in the original release)Newspaper Clipping added to the Court Record.Mia:\nI hope you don't mind, Mr. Grossberg... I... I need to finish this myself.Grossberg:\nAh, yes, but... I'm afraid what you have will not be enough, m'dear. I'll go and have a look at the downstairs reading room and see what else I can find.Mia:\nTh-Thank you!Grossberg:\nI want to do whatever I can to be of help to you, Mia! Well, it looks like recess is about over. We'd better all get moving!Mia:\n(I guess so... That recess sure seemed longer than 20 minutes though...)To be continued.April 11, 12:13 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt will now reconvene. Mr. Payne, please call your witness.Payne:\nThis next person is someone who witnessed the crime as it happened. The prosecution calls Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne to the stand!Payne:\n...Judge:\n...Mia:\n(Wh-What's with this stiff silence...?)Judge:\nIn my long career as a judge, I have been deceived by many witnesses. It's my job to doubt; to take no one at their word... But in your case, I must admit that you radiate a glow of complete sincerity.Mia:\n(I can't believe he actually said that!)Payne:\nOh! Um, now then, witness. Could you please state your full name?Dahlia:\n... I, umm...Judge:\nDon't worry, sweetie. There's no need to be nervous!Payne:\nIf anyone says anything rude, you can be sure, I'll cut them right down to size!Judge:\nAnd I will bash them with my gavel!Mia:\n(I love how they look straight at me when they say that...)Dahlia:\nUm, thank you... for calming my nerves. You are all so nice... I almost feel right at home.Payne:\nNot at all!Judge:\nIt was nothing!Mia:\nIf we may move on now... What is your full name and occupation?Dahlia:\nMy name is Dahlia Hawthorne. I'm a junior in Literature at Ivy University. I just want to say... It's an honor for me to be here in your noble presence.Payne:\nThe honor is all mine!Judge:\nNo... The honor is all mine.Mia:\n(Well, we know whose milkshake brings all the boys to the yard...)Dahlia:\n...Umm. Sir?Payne:\nIs there something I can help you with?Judge:\nYou just go on and say whatever is on your mind!Dahlia:\nI'm sure that there must be some kind of mistake. Feenie wouldn't kill anyone. I just know it!Judge:\nYes, yes... I can see why you'd say that.Mia:\n(She's going to be a tough witness, alright... It only took her 12 seconds to wrap them all around her little finger.)Judge:\nNow then, please proceed with your testimony. Let's hear about what you witnessed on the day of the incident, if you please.Witness Testimony-- What I Witnessed --Dahlia:\nI had been planning to go back to Feenie's place after class was over.\nFeenie and Dougie... They were talking behind the building.\nThen suddenly... Dougie got all wobbly and just collapsed.\nThat's when Feenie noticed that I was there.\nI went to go and find some other students and they called the authorities.Judge:\nI-I don't know what to say! According to you, Ms. Hawthorne... ...the defendant didn't do anything wrong!Payne:Payne:\nYoung lady. As old as I am, even I recall how hot the flames of young passion can burn. Nevertheless... It is my job to discover the truth. Please, tell us the truth...Dahlia:\nBut... But, I... I would never...Mia:Mia:\nThat's more than enough, witness. I won't allow this to continue.Judge:\nWh-What do you mean by that?Mia:\nPlease, just let me proceed with my cross-examination, Your Honor. I, for one, don't plan to win my case on a bunch of paper-thin lies!Dahlia:\n...Tee hee. You haven't changed a bit... Mia Fey.Mia:\n...Payne:\nWhat's this? So, you two are... acquainted?Mia:\nYes. We've met before... Once.Dahlia:\n...Judge:\nIn any case, Ms. Fey, the floor is all yours.Dahlia:\nIt's good to see you again, Madame Fey!Mia:\n\"Madame\"!? (I'm no one's grandma yet, girlie!)Cross Examination-- What I Witnessed --Dahlia:\nI had been planning to go back to Feenie's place after class was over.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nNow, unless I'm mistaken, Feenie -- I mean, Mr. Wright is in the Art Department. If that's the case, then what were you doing by the Pharmacology building?\nDahlia:\nWell... I'm in the Literature Department. I'm studying Japanese Senryu poetry.\nJudge:\nOho hoh! How wonderful! It's that humorous, yet satirical style of haiku, yes?\nDahlia:\n\"Nothing left to do... When a man reaches this age, sleep is his best friend.\"\nMia:\n(That's supposed to be poetry? Sounds more like a mid-life crisis!)\nDahlia:\nFor me to get to the Art Department, I have to walk through that back area.\nJudge:\nAh, yes I see. That makes sense. When I want to enter the courthouse, I always walk through the front doors.\nMia:\n(How else would you enter? Teleportation!?)Dahlia:\nFeenie and Dougie...They were talking behind the building.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nSo who is this \"Dougie\" person?\nDahlia:\nOh, I'm sorry. Doug Swallow. We were dating until about eight months ago...\nMia:\nSo what were Dougie-- *ahem* Mr. Swallow and Mr. Wright talking about anyway?\nDahlia:\n... H-How can you be so mean? I would never... I would never eavesdrop... I wasn't raised to be so rude and unrefined!\nPayne:\nThat's right, Ms. Fey!\nJudge:\nDon't drag the witness down to your level!\nMia:\n(Why am I being demonized here?)\nJudge:\nPlease, go on. What did you see next?Dahlia:\nThen suddenly... Dougie got all wobbly and just collapsed.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nAre you saying that the victim just collapsed on his own?\nDahlia:\nY-Yes.\nMia:\nIn other words, the defendant never touched the victim. Is that right?\nDahlia:\nI was watching the whole time. Feenie never did a thing to Dougie!\nMia:\n(If I press her for no good reason, I just know the judge will get angry with me... Hmm, so what should I do about her testimony just now?)\n\n\n\nLeave it alone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n(Hmm... I suppose her statement works in our favor, for now. I'll hold off on looking into it any deeper until it's necessary.)\nJudge:\nVery well, young lady, please go on with your testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nShow contradiction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nFeeble lies are not very becoming, Ms. Hawthorne, so let's drop them, shall we?\nDahlia:\nWh-What...! I...! I would never...!\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nMs. Fey! I will not allow you to badger this witness!\nMia:\n...\nPayne:\nI-I believe the defense is engaged in a-a... fishing expedition.\nMia:\n...\nPayne:\nThat is... Err... She has no supporting...\nMia:\n...\nPayne:\nP-Please don't glare at me like that...! I-I'm just doing my job!\nMia:\nNow then, Ms. Hawthorne. The defendant's palmprint was found on Mr. Swallow's leather jacket. It has already been shown that Mr. Wright did, in fact, push the victim.\nDahlia:\nWhat...?\nMia:\nThere's no need to try to cover for the defendant. It would be much better if you came out and told us the whole truth.\nJudge:\nHmm... There's nothing to worry about, young lady. Just tell us everything that you saw.\nDahlia:\nY-Yes, Your Honor... I-I will. If you don't mind, I-I'd like to revise my testimony.\nMia:\n(Looks like we're finally getting somewhere...)\nChanges statement from \"Then suddenly... Dougie got all wobbly and just collapsed.\" to \"Um, actually, I didn't see the moment he pushed Dougie.\"\nChanges statement from \"That's when Feenie noticed that I was there.\" to \"It didn't look like they were fighting, and I didn't hear anything unusual either.\"Dahlia:\nUm, actually, I didn't see the moment he pushed Dougie.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nYou didn't see it!?\nDahlia:\nWell, I saw the moment when Dougie fell to the ground...\nPayne:\nAnd at that time, there was only the two of them at the scene? The defendant, Phoenix Wright, and the victim, Doug Swallow?\nDahlia:\nYes... that's right.Dahlia:\nThat's when Feenie noticed that I was there.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nAnd what did Mr. Wright say when he saw you?\nDahlia:\nI-I'm sorry. I-I was so flustered that I... I really don't remember. P-Please forgive me.\nMia:\nYou don't remember...?\nJudge:\nWell, that's common enough. Sometimes I can't recall a sentence I passed only minutes prior!\nMia:\n(Please... Someone, anyone... Stop him before he gets hurt... by me.)Dahlia:\nIt didn't look like they were fighting, and I didn't hear anything unusual either. (Changed from [It didn't look like they were fighting, and I didn't hear any noise either.] in the original release)Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nSo then, what did it look like they were doing to you?\nDahlia:\nI thought they were having a nice, friendly afternoon conversation.\nMia:\n(Oh, give me a break!)\nDahlia:\nThat's why I really wasn't watching them all that closely.\nJudge:\nDid you notice anything out of the ordinary at all?\nDahlia:\nNo, nothing at all... Mr. Judge.\nJudge:\nOh, I like the sound of that! \"Mr. Judge\"... Now then, please proceed with your testimony.Present Phoenix's Testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"You say you \"didn't hear anything unusual\". Is that correct?\"Dahlia:\nI went to go and find some other students and they called the authorities.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nWhen you say \"students\" do you mean students from the Pharmacology Department?\nDahlia:\nYes. They're all very fond of their drugs...\nMia:\nPlease try to stay on topic! So to find some Pharmacology students, you went to the labs, correct?\nDahlia:\nThat's what I was planning to do... But in the end, I wound up not going. A group of about 10 research students came running out of the building entrance. Somehow they all seemed to know what was going on...\nMia:\n(The students knew what was going on...?)\n\n\n\nLeave it alone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n(The Pharmacology students... They have nothing to do with the incident. I think what I need is more information about Dahlia herself.)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress for more details\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nBut how could the students have known what was going on?\nDahlia:\nWell... I don't know for sure that they knew what had happened. It's just, they all seemed kind of excited about something.\nMia:\n(Hmm... It doesn't look like I'm going to get any more info about the students.)\nPayne:\nSo did the students call the police?\nDahlia:\nY-Yes. I-I was just so... I was so panicked...\nJudge:\nHmm. Yes, well anyone would have been, my dear.\nLeads back to cross-examinationMia:\n(That girl... She's telling a super obvious lie, and she knows it. She's just pretending to protect Mr. Wright... Yes, that's got to be it! Way to go, Mia! OK, that means I'm going to have to dig deep to find the contradiction on this one!)Mia:\nYou say you \"didn't hear anything unusual\". Is that correct? (Changed from [You say you didn't hear any noise. Is that correct?] in the original release)Dahlia:\nYes. That's why I was very relaxed, looking at the scenery around me.Mia:\nThat's nice, but I find that just a little odd. I have here, the testimony of your boyfriend, Mr. Phoenix Wright. And he clearly testified to the effect... ...that when he pushed the victim, he heard a sharp, loud noise.Dahlia:\nH-He said that?Mia:\nIf you were really that close to the two of them, why didn't you hear this noise as well?Dahlia:\nI...!Payne:Payne:\nW-Well, maybe the noise just wasn't all that memorable.Mia:Mia:\nBut according to Mr. Wright's testimony, it was a sharp noise like a \"SNAP\"! There's no way a noise like that could fail to make an impression!Payne:\nAck!!Dahlia:\nUmm... May I have a moment to answer?Judge:\nB-By all means!Dahlia:\nI know the reason why I didn't hear the noise. You see, the truth is... I had my headphones on, and I was listening to music at the time.Payne:\nH-H-Headphones...? You mean that both of your ears were covered?Dahlia:\nThe rain was just beginning to let up... But it seemed as though Thor wasn't ready for his fun to come to an end yet. So the sky continued to flash and rumble.Mia:\nThunder and lightning, huh...Dahlia:\nYes, I'm afraid of the sound of thunder. So I put my headphones on to block it out...Payne:\nHee, hee, hee, hee... Well, Your Honor? As you can see, there weren't any contradictions in her testimony after all.Judge:\nHmm...Mia:\n(Wait a sec, Mia! That testimony just now... She said something that could totally change this whole case!)She didn't hear anything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nYour Honor! There is a problem with the witness's testimony!\nJudge:\nWh-What do you mean!?\nPayne:\nWh-What is this \"problem\"!?\nMia:\nIt's obvious. The problem is that the witness claims to have not heard the \"SNAP!\"\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nA-Are you deaf!? Did you pay attention to the testimony!? She said she didn't hear it because she was listening to music with her headphones!\nJudge:\nMs. Fey! I'm surprised you're going senile before me!\nMia:\n(I'm not THAT bad! ...I think.)\nJudge:\nWell, the testimony we've just heard seems to be very decisive. The only one that could have killed the victim was the defendant, Mr. Phoenix Wright!\nDahlia:\nN-No! Please...! I-I never meant to incriminate him!\nMia:\n(This is bad, Mia! If you don't do something, we're going to lose this!! Think again! What is it about this testimony that doesn't make sense...?)\nLeads back to:\n\"She said something that could totally change this whole case!)\"She was listening to music.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nYour Honor! There is a problem with the witness's testimony!\nJudge:\nWh-What do you mean!?\nPayne:\nWh-What is this \"problem\"!?\nMia:\nIt's obvious. The problem is that she claims to have been listening to music!\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nA-Are you deaf!? Did you pay attention to the testimony!? She explained she was listening to music to cover up the sound of thunder!\nJudge:\nMs. Fey! I must warn you that I can be even more frightening than Zeus when I'm angry!\nMia:\n(Yikes! I'm in trouble now!)\nJudge:\nWell, the testimony we've just heard seems to be very decisive. The only one that could have killed the victim was the defendant, Mr. Phoenix Wright!\nDahlia:\nN-No!

There is a problem with the witness's testimony!\"Mia:\nYour Honor! There is a problem with the witness's testimony!Judge:\nWh-What do you mean!?Mia:\nDidn't you notice? She said there was lightning, correct?Judge:\nYes... What about it?Mia:\nWell, lightning is actually a large discharge of electricity in the atmosphere, am I right?Judge:\nNow's not the time for a science lesson, Ms. Fey!Mia:\nYes, Your Honor. Anyway, since the cause of death was electrocution... ...isn't it possible that the victim died from being hit by a bolt of lightning!?Judge:\nOh!Payne:\nAh!Dahlia:\n...!Judge:\nHmm... I must admit that the thought had not occurred to me!Mia:\n(Just what kind of thoughts DO occur to this guy anyway?) This entire case is built on the premise that Mr. Doug Swallow was \"murdered\"... ...but that very premise itself is mistaken! The defense believes that Mr. Swallow was, in fact, the victim of a stray bolt!Judge:\nI-It appears the defense may be on to something! Could it be that the death was actually accidental?Mia:\n(Alright, you did it, Mia! I'll be taking that \"Not Guilty\" now if you don't--)Payne:Payne:\nHee, hee, hee, hee, hee... I'm hurt that you have such a low opinion of me, Ms. Fey.Mia:\nHuh...?Payne:\nI'm not a fool, you know. The prosecution has done its research, Your Honor. We found that there were no lightning strikes on that day at that location!Mia:\nWhaaa!?Payne:\nWhat's more... We have evidence that the electrical cable is definitely linked to this case.Judge:\nE-Evidence, Mr. Payne!? Well, what is this evidence?Payne:\nThis affidavit.Judge:\nAnd who is this affidavit from?Payne:\nThe Pharmacology students who were conducting experiments in their labs that day. Allow me to read out to the court the testimony of the Pharmacology students. \"All equipment in the labs lost power all of a sudden at around 3:00 PM that day.\"Judge:\nWas it a blackout?Payne:\nAll of the labs' equipment runs of high-voltage, Your Honor.Mia:\nSo you're saying the equipment lost power because...Payne:\nPrecisely. They lost power because of the severed electrical cable. The power outage occurred at approximately 3:00 PM...Judge:\nWhich fits with the time of death listed in the autopsy report.Payne:\nExactly! In other words... The victim died as a result of touching the severed electrical cable. According to the students, the cables were very old. They were planning on having them replaced in the near future.Judge:\nHmm, I see...Payne:\nApparently the cables had become so brittle... ...that even the smallest bump would've caused them to break.Students' Testimony added to the Court Record.Judge:\nHowever... There is one thing that troubles me. If the cable could have been broken by any small bump... ...then it wouldn't have snapped if it hadn't been bumped into, correct?Payne:\nW-Well... I suppose you could say that.Judge:\nHmm, Ms. Fey. Do you have any thoughts regarding the cause of the severed cable?Mia:\nY-Your Honor... (I don't like how this is looking one bit! I have to come up with something to try to regain some momentum!) If it pleases the court, the defense would like to state its opinion.Judge:\nWell then, let's hear it.

(Ouch, that was harsh...) Please, Your Honor! Give me one more chance!\nLeads back to:\n\"Well then, let's hear it.\"Mia:\nYour Honor. Please think back to Mr. Wright's testimony.Judge:\nThe defendant's testimony?Mia:\nHe said that after he pushed the victim, he heard a loud, sharp noise. Now, this happened at around 3:00 PM, correct?Judge:\nYes, that sounds right. Wait! Are you saying that...Mia:\nThe lab equipment lost power at 2:55 PM... which fits right in Mr. Wright's timeline. In other words, it was Mr. Wright's shove that caused the power outage.Payne:\nYes! The prosecution also came to that same conclusion. And it was that very shove that caused Mr. Swallow to be electrocuted!Mia:Mia:\nI'm afraid I can't agree with you there, Mr. Payne.Payne:\nWh-What's that supposed to mean?Mia:\nTake a good look at where the victim landed after being shoved. See the umbrella? It's by the electrical pole. That's right. The victim banged into that pole as a result of being pushed. It was that impact that caused the cable to break.Judge:\nHmm... Well, that makes sense. And then the victim was electrocuted.Mia:\nI'm sorry Your Honor, but no. It doesn't make sense at all. If the victim was shoved into the far pole... ...then he couldn't have been electrocuted by this severed cable in the foreground here!Payne:\nAAAAAAAAAAHH!!Mia:\nIn other words... Someone other than my client must have electrocuted the victim!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court!Mia:\n(Ah, the lamentations of my enemy. How I've longed to hear them!)Judge:\nIt-It's true...

She's finally starting to show her true colors!)Witness Testimony-- What I Witnessed, Part 2 --Dahlia:\nThe truth is... Feenie pushed him twice.\nThe first time was into the electrical pole. That's when the cable broke.\nThen Dougie tried his best to run away from him...\nBut Feenie caught up and crashed into him from behind.\nThe cable snapping, and Dougie being electrocuted -- it all occured [sic] in less than a minute.Judge:\nHmm... So after being shoved... ...the victim got up and tried to run away.Payne:\nAnd that is when the defendant pushed him for the second time.Dahlia:\nI'm so sorry, Feenie... But I... I just have to tell the truth. Am I doing the right thing? Am I, Mr. Judge?Judge:\nOf course you are, my dear! As painful as it may seem, you are. Now then, Ms. Fey.

If that's the case, then what were you doing by the Pharmacology building?\nDahlia:\nWell... I'm in the Literature Department. I'm studying Japanese Senryu poetry.\nJudge:\nOho hoh! How wonderful! It's that humorous, yet satirical style of haiku, yes?\nDahlia:\n\"Nothing left to do... When a man reaches this age, sleep is his best friend.\"\nMia:\n(That's supposed to be poetry? Sounds more like a mid-life crisis!)\nDahlia:\nFor me to get to the Art Department, I have to walk through that back area.\nJudge:\nAh, yes I see. That makes sense. When I want to enter the courthouse, I always walk through the front doors.\nMia:\n(How else would you enter? Teleportation!?)Dahlia:\nFeenie and Dougie...They were talking behind the building.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nSo who is this \"Dougie\" person?\nDahlia:\nOh, I'm sorry. Doug Swallow. We were dating until about eight months ago...\nMia:\nSo what were Dougie-- *ahem* Mr. Swallow and Mr. Wright talking about anyway?\nDahlia:\n... H-How can you be so mean? I would never... I would never eavesdrop... I wasn't raised to be so rude and unrefined!\nPayne:\nThat's right, Ms. Fey!\nJudge:\nDon't drag the witness down to your level!\nMia:\n(Why am I being demonized here?)\nJudge:\nPlease, go on. What did you see next?Dahlia:\nThen suddenly... Dougie got all wobbly and just collapsed.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nAre you saying that the victim just collapsed on his own?\nDahlia:\nY-Yes.\nMia:\nIn other words, the defendant never touched the victim. Is that right?\nDahlia:\nI was watching the whole time. Feenie never did a thing to Dougie!\nMia:\n(If I press her for no good reason, I just know the judge will get angry with me... Hmm, so what should I do about her testimony just now?)\n\n\n\nLeave it alone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n(Hmm... I suppose her statement works in our favor, for now. I'll hold off on looking into it any deeper until it's necessary.)\nJudge:\nVery well, young lady, please go on with your testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nShow contradiction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nFeeble lies are not very becoming, Ms. Hawthorne, so let's drop them, shall we?\nDahlia:\nWh-What...! I...! I would never...!\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nMs. Fey! I will not allow you to badger this witness!\nMia:\n...\nPayne:\nI-I believe the defense is engaged in a-a... fishing expedition.\nMia:\n...\nPayne:\nThat is... Err... She has no supporting...\nMia:\n...\nPayne:\nP-Please don't glare at me like that...! I-I'm just doing my job!\nMia:\nNow then, Ms. Hawthorne. The defendant's palmprint was found on Mr. Swallow's leather jacket. It has already been shown that Mr. Wright did, in fact, push the victim.\nDahlia:\nWhat...?\nMia:\nThere's no need to try to cover for the defendant. It would be much better if you came out and told us the whole truth.\nJudge:\nHmm... There's nothing to worry about, young lady. Just tell us everything that you saw.\nDahlia:\nY-Yes, Your Honor... I-I will. If you don't mind, I-I'd like to revise my testimony.\nMia:\n(Looks like we're finally getting somewhere...)\nChanges statement from \"Then suddenly... Dougie got all wobbly and just collapsed.\" to \"Um, actually, I didn't see the moment he pushed Dougie.\"\nChanges statement from \"That's when Feenie noticed that I was there.\" to \"It didn't look like they were fighting, and I didn't hear anything unusual either.\"Dahlia:\nUm, actually, I didn't see the moment he pushed Dougie.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nYou didn't see it!?\nDahlia:\nWell, I saw the moment when Dougie fell to the ground...\nPayne:\nAnd at that time, there was only the two of them at the scene? The defendant, Phoenix Wright, and the victim, Doug Swallow?\nDahlia:\nYes... that's right.Dahlia:\nThat's when Feenie noticed that I was there.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nAnd what did Mr. Wright say when he saw you?\nDahlia:\nI-I'm sorry. I-I was so flustered that I... I really don't remember. P-Please forgive me.\nMia:\nYou don't remember...?\nJudge:\nWell, that's common enough. Sometimes I can't recall a sentence I passed only minutes prior!\nMia:\n(Please... Someone, anyone... Stop him before he gets hurt... by me.)Dahlia:\nIt didn't look like they were fighting, and I didn't hear anything unusual either. (Changed from [It didn't look like they were fighting, and I didn't hear any noise either.] in the original release)Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nSo then, what did it look like they were doing to you?\nDahlia:\nI thought they were having a nice, friendly afternoon conversation.\nMia:\n(Oh, give me a break!)\nDahlia:\nThat's why I really wasn't watching them all that closely.\nJudge:\nDid you notice anything out of the ordinary at all?\nDahlia:\nNo, nothing at all... Mr. Judge.\nJudge:\nOh, I like the sound of that! \"Mr. Judge\"... Now then, please proceed with your testimony.Present Phoenix's Testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"You say you \"didn't hear anything unusual\". Is that correct?\"Dahlia:\nI went to go and find some other students and they called the authorities.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nWhen you say \"students\" do you mean students from the Pharmacology Department?\nDahlia:\nYes. They're all very fond of their drugs...\nMia:\nPlease try to stay on topic! So to find some Pharmacology students, you went to the labs, correct?\nDahlia:\nThat's what I was planning to do... But in the end, I wound up not going. A group of about 10 research students came running out of the building entrance. Somehow they all seemed to know what was going on...\nMia:\n(The students knew what was going on...?)\n\n\n\nLeave it alone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n(The Pharmacology students... They have nothing to do with the incident. I think what I need is more information about Dahlia herself.)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress for more details\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nBut how could the students have known what was going on?\nDahlia:\nWell... I don't know for sure that they knew what had happened. It's just, they all seemed kind of excited about something.\nMia:\n(Hmm... It doesn't look like I'm going to get any more info about the students.)\nPayne:\nSo did the students call the police?\nDahlia:\nY-Yes. I-I was just so... I was so panicked...\nJudge:\nHmm. Yes, well anyone would have been, my dear.\nLeads back to cross-examinationMia:\n(That girl... She's telling a super obvious lie, and she knows it. She's just pretending to protect Mr. Wright... Yes, that's got to be it! Way to go, Mia! OK, that means I'm going to have to dig deep to find the contradiction on this one!)Mia:\nYou say you \"didn't hear anything unusual\". Is that correct? (Changed from [You say you didn't hear any noise. Is that correct?] in the original release)Dahlia:\nYes. That's why I was very relaxed, looking at the scenery around me.Mia:\nThat's nice, but I find that just a little odd. I have here, the testimony of your boyfriend, Mr. Phoenix Wright. And he clearly testified to the effect... ...that when he pushed the victim, he heard a sharp, loud noise.Dahlia:\nH-He said that?Mia:\nIf you were really that close to the two of them, why didn't you hear this noise as well?Dahlia:\nI...!Payne:Payne:\nW-Well, maybe the noise just wasn't all that memorable.Mia:Mia:\nBut according to Mr. Wright's testimony, it was a sharp noise like a \"SNAP\"! There's no way a noise like that could fail to make an impression!Payne:\nAck!!Dahlia:\nUmm... May I have a moment to answer?Judge:\nB-By all means!Dahlia:\nI know the reason why I didn't hear the noise. You see, the truth is... I had my headphones on, and I was listening to music at the time.Payne:\nH-H-Headphones...? You mean that both of your ears were covered?Dahlia:\nThe rain was just beginning to let up... But it seemed as though Thor wasn't ready for his fun to come to an end yet. So the sky continued to flash and rumble.Mia:\nThunder and lightning, huh...Dahlia:\nYes, I'm afraid of the sound of thunder. So I put my headphones on to block it out...Payne:\nHee, hee, hee, hee... Well, Your Honor? As you can see, there weren't any contradictions in her testimony after all.Judge:\nHmm...Mia:\n(Wait a sec, Mia! That testimony just now... She said something that could totally change this whole case!)She didn't hear anything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nYour Honor! There is a problem with the witness's testimony!\nJudge:\nWh-What do you mean!?\nPayne:\nWh-What is this \"problem\"!?\nMia:\nIt's obvious. The problem is that the witness claims to have not heard the \"SNAP!\"\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nA-Are you deaf!? Did you pay attention to the testimony!? She said she didn't hear it because she was listening to music with her headphones!\nJudge:\nMs. Fey! I'm surprised you're going senile before me!\nMia:\n(I'm not THAT bad! ...I think.)\nJudge:\nWell, the testimony we've just heard seems to be very decisive. The only one that could have killed the victim was the defendant, Mr. Phoenix Wright!\nDahlia:\nN-No! Please...! I-I never meant to incriminate him!\nMia:\n(This is bad, Mia! If you don't do something, we're going to lose this!! Think again! What is it about this testimony that doesn't make sense...?)\nLeads back to:\n\"She said something that could totally change this whole case!)\"She was listening to music.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nYour Honor!

The problem is that she claims to have been listening to music!\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nA-Are you deaf!? Did you pay attention to the testimony!?

She said there was lightning, correct?Judge:\nYes... What about it?Mia:\nWell, lightning is actually a large discharge of electricity in the atmosphere, am I right?Judge:\nNow's not the time for a science lesson, Ms. Fey!Mia:\nYes, Your Honor. Anyway, since the cause of death was electrocution... ...isn't it possible that the victim died from being hit by a bolt of lightning!?Judge:\nOh!Payne:\nAh!Dahlia:\n...!Judge:\nHmm... I must admit that the thought had not occurred to me!Mia:\n(Just what kind of thoughts DO occur to this guy anyway?) This entire case is built on the premise that Mr. Doug Swallow was \"murdered\"... ...but that very premise itself is mistaken! The defense believes that Mr. Swallow was, in fact, the victim of a stray bolt!Judge:\nI-It appears the defense may be on to something! Could it be that the death was actually accidental?Mia:\n(Alright, you did it, Mia! I'll be taking that \"Not Guilty\" now if you don't--)Payne:Payne:\nHee, hee, hee, hee, hee... I'm hurt that you have such a low opinion of me, Ms. Fey.Mia:\nHuh...?Payne:\nI'm not a fool, you know. The prosecution has done its research, Your Honor. We found that there were no lightning strikes on that day at that location!Mia:\nWhaaa!?Payne:\nWhat's more... We have evidence that the electrical cable is definitely linked to this case.Judge:\nE-Evidence, Mr. Payne!? Well, what is this evidence?Payne:\nThis affidavit.Judge:\nAnd who is this affidavit from?Payne:\nThe Pharmacology students who were conducting experiments in their labs that day. Allow me to read out to the court the testimony of the Pharmacology students. \"All equipment in the labs lost power all of a sudden at around 3:00 PM that day.\"Judge:\nWas it a blackout?Payne:\nAll of the labs' equipment runs of high-voltage, Your Honor.Mia:\nSo you're saying the equipment lost power because...Payne:\nPrecisely. They lost power because of the severed electrical cable. The power outage occurred at approximately 3:00 PM...Judge:\nWhich fits with the time of death listed in the autopsy report.Payne:\nExactly! In other words... The victim died as a result of touching the severed electrical cable. According to the students, the cables were very old. They were planning on having them replaced in the near future.Judge:\nHmm, I see...Payne:\nApparently the cables had become so brittle... ...that even the smallest bump would've caused them to break.Students' Testimony added to the Court Record.Judge:\nHowever... There is one thing that troubles me. If the cable could have been broken by any small bump... ...then it wouldn't have snapped if it hadn't been bumped into, correct?Payne:\nW-Well... I suppose you could say that.Judge:\nHmm, Ms. Fey. Do you have any thoughts regarding the cause of the severed cable?Mia:\nY-Your Honor... (I don't like how this is looking one bit!

Why did I do that...?That girl... You shouldn't see her anymore.Hey! It's none of your business!I'm telling you for your sake. If you continue to see her, it's going to be bad news.Y-You're lying!Just listen to me. There's something you need to know about that girl... ...Stop it! D-Don't talk about her like that!It-It wasn't me! I-I d-didn't... I didn't do it!-- Five Years Earlier --Mia FeySecond TrialApril 11, 9:40 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3Mia:\n(Whew, it's finally time... I'm kind of nervous...)???:\n*Ah-HHHHEM!*Mia:\nOh! Mr. Grossberg! Good morning!Grossberg:\nAh, Mia. Please calm yourself down! You're going to get yourself arrested for suspicious behavior, you know.Mia:\nWhat are you talking about!! I am relaxed, Mr. Grossberg!! Look at me, I'm relaxed!!Grossberg:\n*Grrrmmphh* L-Let go of my lapels! Hmph... You obviously haven't got the temperament to be a lawyer.Mia:\nI, err... I'm so sorry! It's just that I'm so nervous today...Grossberg:\nOh, that's right. This is your first time in the big leagues, isn't it? Well, never you fear my dear. I, Marvin Grossberg, am at your service!Mia:\nUmm, actually this is my second time in court...Grossberg:\nStill, you surprised me... What, with your earnest request last night... \"Let me handle this case!\" you suddenly said. And quite forcefully, too!Mia:\nI just found out yesterday. About the case, I mean.Grossberg:\nWhat? And you've already learned all the relevant facts?Mia:\nWell about that... You see... I mean, of course I have! I think.Grossberg:\nOh dear... In any case, don't let our client see you're so nervous. You see the poor young man in the pink sweater over there? That's our client.Phoenix:\n*cough* *sniffle* Good morning there everybody!Mia:\nGood morning... (Try to keep smiling, Mia!)Phoenix:\nI, err, I just want to say... I'll give it all I've got! Yup, it'll be fine! No prob! *cough* *achoo* *achoo*Mia:\nOh, what's wrong? Do you have a cold or something... Mr. Wry?Phoenix:\nActually, it's Wright... Like the flying brothers... People screw it up all the time. And yes I have a cold. That's what this mask is for. My doc says this way, I won't give it to anyone else... Be kind to others, he says...Mia:\nRight, Mr. Wright! You have nothing to fear in court today! If you are truly innocent... I promise I will save you!Phoenix:\nNnnnggghh... P-Please l-let go of my shirt... *cough*Mia:\n(That's right, he's the one on trial, not you! He's the one who should be nervous! You need to stay strong for your client, Mia!)Mia:\nMy name is Mia Fey. I'm still pretty new at this lawyer thing... The first time I appeared in court was a year ago. But that trial traumatized me so badly, I thought I'd never set foot in another courtroom. It's been one year since then, and well, here I am again. But this time... This time I'm going to win. (Changed from [But this time... This time I'll win.] in the original release) For my client... And for myself.April 11, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Phoenix Wright.Mia:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor!Payne:\nThe prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Judge:\nThe defense today is... Ms... Ms... Mia Fey, was it?Mia:\nY-Yes, Your Honor. Is there a problem?Judge:\nI was under the impression that Marvin Grossberg was to be leading the defense.Mia:\nYes! Well, you see... Mr. Grossberg had... A-A bit of an emergency...Judge:\nEmergency? But isn't that him standing there right next to you?Mia:\nYes, well...Judge:\nYou... You're just a rookie. Are you sure you can really handle this?Mia:\n(Don't let him scare you, Mia! Give him your toughest look!) Of course, Your Honor! ... I think.Judge:\nHmm... Well, Mr. Payne. Your opening statement, please.Payne:\nWell, well, well... I can't believe a veteran like me has to spend his time baby-sitting a new defense lawyer.Mia:\n...!Payne:\nDon't worry little girl. It will all be over soon.Mia:\n(What was that all about? Was he trying to trash-talk me?)Payne:\nNow then, I'd like to proceed with a summary of events on the day in question. The incident occurred on the campus of Ivy University. The murder victim was a student named Doug Swallow. He was a fourth year student studying Pharmacology.Judge:\nHmm... It sounds like he was a very bright young man.Payne:\nYes, well, next we have a photo taken at the scene of the crime. Students discovered the scene shortly after the murder. They found the victim's body... ...and the defendant, who had obviously bungled his getaway. They then called the police.Judge:\nHmm... That certainly makes the defendant look very suspicious indeed. Very well. The court accepts this photo into the record as evidence.Crime Photo 1 added to the Court Record.Judge:\nBy the way... I can't quite tell the cause of death from this photo.Payne:\nHee, hee, hee... Your reputation for sagacity is well-earned, Your Honor. The truth is that this victim died a rather unusual death.Mia:\nAn unusual death...!?Judge:\nWhat do you mean, Mr. Payne!?Payne:\nWell... Perhaps the defense would like to take this question.Mia:\nHuh...!?Payne:\nA simple question. I thought I might loosen you up a bit. I am a genteel-man, if you will.Mia:\nUm, a what? (Stand up to him, Mia! Show him what you're made of!)Grossberg:\nAh, a perfect opportunity! Well, what was it? The cause! Go on! ... ...Please say you know at least this much.Mia:\nI-I'm so sorry... I-I didn't get a chance to read through the whole file.Grossberg:\n*groan* My hemorrhoids are beginning to act up... Now see here! The details of the case are filed under the Court Record. But you knew that already, didn't you?Mia:\n(Ah! The Court Record! I think I can see that by pressing [the R Button / Tab]...) (Changed from [Ah! The Court Record! I think I can see that by touching the Court Record Button...] in the original release)Grossberg:\nAll of the weapons we need can be found in the Court Record. Take a good, hard look at the data there and think carefully before you answer, m'dear!Mia:\nY-Yes, sir! I'll do just that! (I've got to stay calm! I can't let that prosecutor get the better of me! The Court Record... OK, let's take a look! I just press [the R Button / Tab] here... (Changed from [The Court Record... OK, let's take a look! I just touch the Court Record Button here...] in the original release))Judge:\nNow then, would the attorney for the defense please answer the question? What was the cause of death?Asphyxiation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nWell... I think you'll find it was a case of asphyxiation.\nJudge:\nHmm... Asphyxiation, huh?\nGrossberg:\nM-Mia! What are you doing!? (Changed from [M-Mia! What are you saying!?] in the original release)\nMia:\nWell, it's stuffy in here! I can hardly breathe.\nGrossberg:\nNo one's asking how you feel! Please, make sure to properly read the Court Record!\nMia:\nI-I'm so sorry! I'll take a better look! (Hang in there, Mia! Okay! The Court Record is [the R Button / Tab]...) (Changed from [Hang in there, Mia! Open the Court Record with the Court Record Button...] in the original release)\nJudge:\nHmm... I'll ask you once again.\nLeads back to:\n\"What was the cause of death?\"Electrocution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"According to the Court Record, it was a fatal electric shock. In other words, electrocution.\"Hypothermia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nErr... Hypothermia, I believe.\n... ... ......\nMia:\nUmm, Mr. Grossberg? Does it suddenly feel very cold in here to you?\nGrossberg:\nThat's because your absurd reply has brought a chill to the courtroom!\nMia:\nI-I'm so sorry...\nGrossberg:\nLook at the Court Record more carefully, would you! How can you expect to win a case this way!?\nMia:\n(Hang in there, Mia! Okay! The Court Record is [the R Button / Tab]...) (Changed from [Hang in there, Mia! Open the Court Record with the Court Record Button...] in the original release)\nJudge:\nHmm... I'll ask you once again.\nLeads back to:\n\"What was the cause of death?\"Mia:\nAccording to the Court Record, it was a fatal electric shock. In other words, electrocution.Judge:\nElectrocution? Hmm... But how could such a thing happen? Did the murderer use some type of new, super-powerful stun-gun, perhaps?Payne:\nThe answer to that will become crystal clear as this trial proceeds, Your Honor. But before that, there is one more vital issue.Mia:\nWh-What's that?Payne:\nWhy, motive of course. Apparently there was some bad blood between the victim and the defendant.Judge:\nBad blood...?Mia:\nWh-What do you mean...?Payne:\nOopsie! I'm terribly sorry. You're the defense attorney, so you must know all about it. I shouldn't be stealing your spotlight like this.Mia:\n(I really don't like this guy's smug attitude...)Grossberg:\nThat's Winston Payne for you. He is one smooth operator, if you catch my drift. They don't call him the \"Rookie Killer\" for nothing, you know.Judge:\nNow then, let's hear from the defense. What was the source of the bad blood between the victim and the defendant? And this time, I would like to see some supporting evidence!Mia:\nEv-Evidence...?Grossberg:\nAh, no need to get all worked up over this. As I said, all our weapons can be found in the Court Record. Find the evidence you need and then shove it into Ol' Graybeard's face!Mia:\nY-Yes, sir! Into Ol' Graybeard's face!Judge:\nErr, Mr. Grossberg. Try to set a better example for the young lady!Grossberg:\nMia, evidence isn't the only thing in the Court Record. People's profiles are as well. You can toggle between Profiles and Evidence with [the R Button / Tab], so be sure to go over it all! (Changed from [You can toggle between Profiles and Evidence, so be sure to go over it all!] in the original release)Judge:\nNow then, let's see what you've got. What was the cause of the bad blood between Phoenix Wright and the victim?Present Dahlia Hawthorne profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The reason for the bad blood between the two of them was... this woman here.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nJudge:\nMr. Grossberg... I honestly think it would be best for the defense if you were in charge. I'm afraid Ms. Fey might stir up some bad blood with this court if she were to continue.\nGrossberg:\nOr simply put, you are quite mistaken, m'dear.\nMia:\nOh no... I'm so sorry...\nJudge:\nEven if you are new, your lack of preparation is inexcusable. Now take a moment and think it over again.\nMia:\nY-Yes, Your Honor! (It's OK! You've got another chance, Mia!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Mia, evidence isn't the only thing in the Court Record.\"Mia:\nThe reason for the bad blood between the two of them was... this woman here.Judge:\nDahlia Hawthorne, is it?Payne:\nVery good, Ms. Fey. You seem to have picked up on at least this much. This woman is the girlfriend of the defendant, Phoenix Wright. But up until about eight months ago, she was with the victim, Mr. Swallow. Clearly she has some part to play in this story.Judge:\nHmm...Grossberg:\nAh, he's done it again. Before the cross-examination starts, he's already got the judge thinking like he wants.Judge:\nVery well, Mr. Payne. Please call your first witness!Payne:\nIf it pleases the court, the prosecution would like to call Mr. Phoenix Wright.Judge:\nWhat? The defendant himself? Well, Ms. Fey?Mia:\n(It's fine! After all, Mr. Wright is innocent, right?) The defense has no objection.Judge:\nVery well. The court calls Mr. Phoenix Wright to the witness stand!Payne:\nWitness, please state your name and occupation.Phoenix:\nOh, ah, yes... My name is Phoenix Wright. My job is, um... Well, right now, I guess I'm a suspect.Judge:\nNo, no. He means what did you do before you were arrested?Phoenix:\nOh... *achoo* *achoo* *achoo* I was a university student.Payne:\nMr. Wright. You understand that you are suspected in the death of your fellow student, Doug Swa--Phoenix:\nBut! But I didn't do it! I'm innocent I tell you! I'm telling you I was... *achoo* *achoo* *cough* *cough* *achoo* *cough*Judge:\nWould the defendant please refrain from passing on his cold to the rest of us!Payne:\nIt seems the witness has something he wants to say.Judge:\nHmm... Well then, Mr. Wright. Please tell us about your relation to the victim.Phoenix:\nRight away, Your Honor!Witness Testimony-- The Victim and I --Phoenix:\nUm, I... I admit I was there...\nBut I'm not a killer! All I did was find his body!\nI hardly knew the guy to begin with...\nI never even talked to that stuck-up British wannabe!Judge:\nHmm... I see. So you hardly knew the victim?Phoenix:\nRight! Like I said, I'm not a killer!Mia:\nWhew... It looks like the judge understands.Grossberg:\nMmfph... You're being na\u00efve, you know. Too na\u00efve.Mia:\nHuh...?Payne:\nHee, hee, hee, hee, hee. It seems that you've forgotten one small thing, young lady.Mia:\nAnd that would be...?Payne:\nThis witness still has to undergo something called cross-examination.Mia:\nCross-examination...?Grossberg:\nHe's right. And it's the defense's duty to carry out the cross-examination. The purpose is to determine if a witness's testimony contains any contradictions.Mia:\nContradictions...?Grossberg:\nIf a witness is lying, their statements will conflict with the Court Record.Mia:\nBut... Mr. Wright is my client!Grossberg:\nEven if he is your client, in court, all lies must be struck down. As a lawyer, that is your duty, you see.Mia:\n(What does he mean by that? Is he saying that testimony just now... That there was a lie -- a contradiction?)Judge:\nNow then, your cross-examination, if you please, Ms. Fey.Mia:\n(Please, Mr. Wright... Tell me you haven't been lying! You wouldn't do that to me... would you...?)Cross Examination-- The Victim and I --Phoenix:\nUm, I... I admit I was there...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nWhen you say \"there\", you mean the place where the victim was murdered?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, sort of. The place where SOMETHING happened anyway.\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\n\"Something\"? You can't hide what happened. We have photographic evidence.\nPhoenix:\n*achoo* *achoo* *achoo* *achoo*\nMia:\nA-Anyway, Mr. Wright... What were you doing at the scene of the crime? I thought you said you didn't know the victim, Mr. Swallow.\nPhoenix:\nIt was just a coincidence! We bumped into each other by accident.\nJudge:\nA coincidence, huh...?Phoenix:\nBut I'm not a killer! All I did was find his body!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nYou say you found the body? So who called the police?\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? Um... *achoo* *cough* *achoo* *cough* *achoo* *cough*\nPayne:\nUnfortunately it was some other students that notified the police.\nJudge:\n\"Other students\"...?\nPayne:\nThat's correct. They were witnesses. Witnesses who saw the defendant standing there, next to the body, in shock!\nJudge:\nW-What! Is this true, Mr. Wright!?\nPhoenix:\n*achoo* *achoo* *achoo* *achoo* *achoo* *achoo*\nMia:\n(Could you stop sneezing every time you're in a bind...?)\nPhoenix:\nW-Well, it's true that I was pretty shocked when I found the body. But, but I...Phoenix:\nI hardly knew the guy to begin with...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nSo, you didn't know his face, or even his name, right?\nPhoenix:\nRight! Um, well, no... That is... I mean...\nMia:\nSo... Which is it? Did you know him or not?\nPhoenix:\n*achoo* *achoo* *achoo*\nJudge:\nNow, see here! You can't avoid answering the question by sneezing all day!\nPhoenix:\nErr... Umm, well... I guess I did know his name.\nMia:\n(N-News to me! Why didn't he tell me that before...?)\nPhoenix:\nUm... I heard he used to date Dollie.\nJudge:\nWho is this \"Dollie\" person?\nPayne:\nAh yes, that would be the defendant's lover, Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne.\nJudge:\nOh, I see. Ah, young love... So bittersweet...\nPhoenix:\nBut that's all I knew about him!Phoenix:\nI never even talked to that stuck-up British wannabe!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nMr. Wright, you stated the following in your testimony: \"I hardly knew the guy to begin with...\"\nPhoenix:\nTh-That's right! I mean why would I even--\nMia:\nBut that doesn't sound right. If you hardly knew him... ...then why would you say that the victim was a \"stuck-up British wannabe\"!?\nPhoenix:\n...\nMia:\n...\nPhoenix:\n... *achoo*\nMia:\nWell, Mr. Wright!?\nPhoenix:\nAh! No! It wasn't me! I'm not a killer, I swear!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. I will give you an opportunity to revise your testimony. How is it that you knew the victim was, as you put it, a \"British wannabe\"...?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, well...\nAdds statement \"He was always walking around with a huge Union Jack on the back of his shirt.\"Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nMr. Wright, you stated the following in your testimony: \"I hardly knew the guy to begin with...\"\nPhoenix:\nTh-That's right! I mean why would I even--\nMia:\nBut that doesn't sound right. If you hardly knew him... ...then why would you say that the victim was a \"stuck-up British wannabe\"!?\nPhoenix:\nUm, well, you see...Phoenix:\nHe was always walking around with a huge Union Jack on the back of his shirt.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nDid you see it at the crime scene? The Union Jack, I mean.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, that's right! I saw it at the crime scene! That's why... That's why I figured he must love British stuff, see? It's true! Cross my heart! I swear I didn't do it...\nMia:\n(He's acting fishier than the salmon I ate last night...)\nJudge:\nMay I ask you something, Ms. Fey?\nMia:\nY-Yes, Your Honor. (What is it now?)\nJudge:\nWho is this person anyway? This \"Union Jack\" fellow...\nMia:\n...\nPayne:\nThe Union Jack is the name of the flag of England.\nJudge:\nOh, I see... So you mean like the \"Stars and Stripes\", right?\nPayne:\nAs usual, Your Honor, your insight astounds me.\nMia:\n(Hey, something just occurred to me... Isn't there something strange about this bit just now?)\nGrossberg:\nMia... There is a contradiction here!\nMia:\nM-Mr. Grossberg!\nGrossberg:\nQuickly now! Show that boy you mean business! With evidence, I mean!\nMia:\n(OK, Mia, check the Court Record carefully!)Present Crime Photo 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Are you certain you saw the \"Union Jack\"?\"Grossberg:\nWell m'dear, do you think you can manage on your own from this point?I can handle it myself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n(One year ago... I was in a courtroom just like this. I can do it. I can handle this myself!)\nGrossberg:\nMmrgh... You mustn't try to bite off more than you can chew, Mia.\nMia:\nI-I'll be fine! I know what I have to do!\nGrossberg:\nRemember, you can always press him to get more information. Oh, and one more thing. When you're going to state a contradiction, make sure you present some definitive proof.\nMia:\n(OK, Mia. One more time, from the very beginning of his testimony!)I need some help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nUmm, Mr. Grossberg... I could use a little help...\nGrossberg:\nAh, please don't look so sad. It brings a tear to my eye when you do. Alright, listen carefully. By comparing the testimony to the Court Record... ...you should be able to discover any contradictions, if there are any. And when you've found one...\nMia:\nI present the piece of evidence that contradicts the witness's testimony...?\nGrossberg:\nYes. That's the ticket!\nMia:\nBut still... I don't see any contradictions in Mr. Wright's testimony!\nGrossberg:\nHmm... Maybe you don't have enough information yet.\nMia:\nInformation...?\nGrossberg:\nYou can press for more information by leaning on a witness.\nMia:\nEven if they're my own client?\nGrossberg:\nIt doesn't matter who it is, if you think they're lying, press them like a cheap suit! That is the obligation of an attorney.\nMia:\n(OK, Mia. One more time, from the very beginning of his testimony!)Mia:\nAre you certain you saw the \"Union Jack\"?Phoenix:\nY-Yeah, I'm sure. It was right there on his back.Judge:\nMs. Fey, is there some point to this line of questioning?Mia:\nYour Honor, please take another look at the crime scene photo. As you can see, there's absolutely nothing written on the victim's back.Phoenix:\nHey! Wait a minute! He's wearing a leather jacket! The Union Jack was on the back of the t-shirt he was wearing...Mia:\nI was under the impression that you accidentally came across the body. But, if that was really the case, then you wouldn't know that, would you? You'd have no idea at all what he was wearing underneath that jacket! Mr. Wright... You've been lying to me!Phoenix:\n... P-P-P-Please forgive me! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!Grossberg:\nMia! You've made our client cry!Mia:\nLet him! That \"P\" on his chest doesn't stand for \"Phoenix\" anyways! I can't believe I trusted him! Mr. Wright was all wrong!Payne:\nHee, hee, hee, hee. That was an impressive bit of cross-examination.Mia:\n...!Payne:\nThank you for uncovering the defendant's lies for me. It's quite clear that this man did not simply \"stumble upon\" the scene of the crime!Phoenix:\nUggghhh...Mia:\n(Uh oh... Did I go too far?)Payne:\nBy the way, Mr. Wright. You seem to have a rather bad cold. Have you taken any medicine for it?Phoenix:\nI, err, umm... Yeah, I took some but...Payne:\nWas the medicine that you took an over-the-counter brand called \"Coldkiller X\"?Phoenix:\nYeah, that's right! It kills colds good! Hey, wait a second... How did you know I'm a big fan of Coldkiller X...?Payne:\nHee, hee, hee, hee... Would you happen to have that medicine with you right now?Phoenix:\nWell... Actually, I seem to have lost it somewhere...Mia:\n(He lost it? Does this even have anything to do with the case...?)Payne:\nMr. Wright... Shall I tell you where your cold medicine is right now?Phoenix:\nHuh...?Payne:\nYour Honor! I'd like you to take a look at another photo from the crime scene!Judge:\nWh-What's this! In the victim's hand, it's... It's Coldkiller X...!Mia:Mia:\nY-Yes, but even I've got a bottle of Coldkiller X in my apartment!Payne:Payne:\nI'm sorry, but I'm afraid that argument won't work. There's no doubt as to who this bottle of Coldkiller X belonged to. Especially since Mr. Wright's fingerprints were all over it!Mia:\nWh-What!?Payne:\nSensing his murderous intent, Mr. Swallow must have picked up the bottle of medicine... ...dropped by Mr. Wright and hid it in his hand. His purpose in doing so can only have been to identify his killer as Phoenix Wright!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court!Payne:\nYour Honor! I'd like to present this photo and bottle as evidence!Judge:\nVery well. The court will accept them into the record.Crime Photo 2 added to the Court Record.Coldkiller X added to the Court Record.Payne:\nAlso, the victim's wristwatch was broken.Judge:\nBroken...?Payne:\nYes, it ceased functioning when a large wave of electricity passed through it. Well, Mr. Wright! Do you have some kind of explanation for all of this!?Phoenix:\nUggghhh...Mia:\n(This is really bad...)Grossberg:\nOh, my buttocks... My poor, poor hemorrhoids...Witness Testimony-- What Really Happened --Phoenix:\nThe truth is... I went because he called me.\nHe was in the Pharmacology Dept., so we agreed to meet at 2:45 behind that building...\nWe talked for a bit, and then at around 3:00, we split up.\nThen later when I went back, I found him lying there.\nI'd been taking Coldkiller X for the last 2 or 3 days...\nBut I lost my bottle of it around lunchtime on the day of the accident.Judge:\nMr. Wright! That's completely different than the testimony you gave previously!Phoenix:\n*achoo* *achoo* *achoo* I-I'm sorry, Your Honor! I was afraid you wouldn't believe the truth!Payne:\nYou'll forgive me if I say I hardly find your current testimony any more credible.Judge:\nHmm... Ms. Fey, please begin your cross-examination.Mia:\n(Oh please, Mr. Wright... Don't tell any more lies.)Cross Examination-- What Really Happened --Phoenix:\nThe truth is... I went because he called me.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nHad you ever met the victim before then?\nPhoenix:\nNo! Never! ... But... That day, he called me up and told me he wanted to talk about Dollie.\nJudge:\nAnd this \"Dollie\" person is...?\nPhoenix:\nMy um... It's kind of embarrassing. She's my, umm, sweetheart...\nGrossberg:\nOomph...! Wh-What... What was that for, Mia!?\nMia:\nOh! I'm so sorry! I just felt like slapping something all of a sudden!\nPayne:\nDahlia Hawthorne was also the lover of the murder victim, Doug Swallow. ...Before she met Mr. Wright, that is.\nJudge:\nHmm... So it was one of those nasty love triangles, I see...Phoenix:\nHe was in the Pharmacology Dept., so we agreed to meet at 2:45 behind that building...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nWas it Mr. Swallow who indicated you should meet at 2:45?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. And we were both there right on time.\nJudge:\nHmm... You said the victim was in the Pharmacology Dept., correct?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, he was studying how to manufacture and improve pharmaceuticals. Everyone called him the \"Alchemist of Ivy U\".\nJudge:\nAn \"alchemist\"... I see...\nPhoenix:\nI gotta admit it was a little suspicious. He had a whole laboratory and everything! It was filled with chemicals and strange machines that run on high-voltage electricity.\nJudge:\nHo ho. How fascinating. He sounds like he was quite an ambitious young man.\nMia:\n(What do I do!? Maybe I should ask him for some more details?)\n\n\n\nAbout timing of the meeting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nSo you are absolutely certain that you met at 2:45?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, pretty sure. That's the time class ends. But they're always doing experiments, so it doesn't matter much.\nMia:\nExperiments...?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. Those pharmacology guys are always in the lab whipping up something.\nMia:\n(Well, it looks like he's right about the time anyway.)\nPayne:\nWitness, let's go on with your testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nAbout Pharmacology Dept.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nI was wondering if you could tell us a bit more about the Pharmacology Department.\nPhoenix:\nWell OK, sure. I don't know all that much though.\nMia:\nA little bit earlier in your testimony, you said something interesting. You said the department uses strange machines that run on high-voltage electricity.\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. And they sure look dangerous. They use non-standard voltages, so there are high-voltage cables everywhere.\nMia:\n\"High-voltage cables\"...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, there were electrical poles set up all around the building. The high-voltage cables run overhead around the roof.\nMia:\n(Finally I think we're getting somewhere...!)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nForget about it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n(I've gotten everything I need from this statement. It's time to move on.)\nPayne:\nIn any case, let's continue with your testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examinationPhoenix:\nWe talked for a bit, and then at around 3:00, we split up.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nSo what was it you were talking about?\nPhoenix:\nYou know... *achoo* *cough* That maybe we should hang out again sometime.\nMia:\n(\"Hang out again sometime\"? I wish that were true.)Phoenix:\nThen later when I went back, I found him lying there.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nSo you say you went back...\nPhoenix:\nUmm, yeah. That's when I found the body.\nMia:\nYes, but why did you go back in the first place? Weren't you angry with him?\nPhoenix:\nWell, th-that's right, I was. ...\nMia:\nThen why, Mr. Wright? Why did you go back there?\nPhoenix:\n... Umm... I thought maybe we could make up.\nMia:\n...\nPayne:\n...\nJudge:\n...\nPhoenix:\n... *achoo* *achoo*\nMia:\n(Judging by the atmosphere... I'm pretty sure no one is buying this.)Phoenix:\nI'd been taking Coldkiller X for the last 2 or 3 days...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nIt's rather unusual to catch a cold this time of the year, isn't it?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I always get a little careless when the weather starts to warm up. I guess I shouldn't sleep with the window open this early in spring, huh?\nMia:\n(I suppose common sense is not always common...) So... Did anyone else know that you were taking cold medicine?\nPhoenix:\nWell, I always took one after meals... So I'm pretty sure all my friends knew about it.Phoenix:\nBut I lost my bottle of it around lunchtime on the day of the accident.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nOn the day of the incident, what did you do for lunch...?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? What does that have to do with anything?\nMia:\nYou can never be too sure...\nPhoenix:\nI always eat with Dollie... Just the two of us. Dollie's homemade lunches are just the greatest! Mmm! Her mini-omelettes are magically delicious! Eheh heh heh.\nGrossberg:\nYeowch!! Wh-Why did you punch me in the jaw!?\nMia:\nOh! I-I'm so sorry...! I just felt like hurting someone all of a sudden!Grossberg:\nWell, Mia?Mia:\nI don't know... I can't seem to find any contradictions.Grossberg:\nThe boy isn't exactly what I'd call a natural-born liar, you know. But still, we can't have him continue to spout nonsense.Mia:\nI know... But what can I do!?Grossberg:\nWell, I'm certain he must still be hiding something. Information! Right now it's information we need more than anything else!After pressing sixth statement and selecting \"About Pharmacology Dept.\" upon pressing second statement:Judge:\nI think that's enough for now. So the defendant and the victim met at approximately the time of his death. And then the defendant returned to the scene for some unknown reason.Payne:\nI'm not entirely convinced by his explanation about the medicine bottle either.Judge:\nLet me be frank here, Mr. Wright. Your testimony cannot be trusted.Phoenix:\nWh-What do you mean!?Payne:\nHee, hee, hee, hee... I knew it was too much work for a little girl.Mia:\nHmph...!Judge:\nHowever, there is one mystery that still remains.Payne:\nThere is, Your Honor?Judge:\nHow the murder was carried out, of course. Just how was the victim electrocuted? I don't believe the murder weapon has been produced yet, correct?Payne:\nWell, that is... I... You are correct, Your Honor.Mia:\n(So how exactly was Mr. Swallow killed...? If I could somehow establish how it was done... Maybe I could still come out of this mess smelling like a rose!)Establish murder method\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor!\"Can't right now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n(Hmm, I do have one idea, but it would be impossible to prove it.)\nGrossberg:\nMia, m'dear. If you have any ideas, now is the time to present them.\nMia:\nMr. Grossberg!\nGrossberg:\nRemember, silence is NOT golden. ...In court, anyway.\nMia:\n(Silence is not golden, huh? Well in that case...)\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor!\"Mia:\nYour Honor!Judge:\nY-Yes, Ms. Fey?Mia:\nI believe that if we were to piece together everything we've heard up until now... ...we should be able to solve the mystery of how Mr. Swallow died.Judge:\nTh-That would be most impressive!Payne:\nHee, hee, hee, hee... Quite the brash statement coming from a rookie! But even a beginner like you must understand the basic rules of the court, yes? An attorney must be able to substantiate their arguments with evidence!Mia:\nHmph! Of course I know that! (Actually, I had totally forgotten about that...)Judge:\nNow then, Ms. Fey. Let me see what you've got. Show me how you believe the victim was electrocuted!Present Crime Photo 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"As for the cause of death...\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nJudge:\nMs. Fey, I'm deeply disappointed in you.\nPayne:\nI'm disappointed as well, Ms. Fey.\nGrossberg:\nTo be honest, I'm a bit disappointed too, Mia.\nPhoenix:\n... *achoo*\nMia:\n(Argh! I need to use my brain on this! Come on, Mia! You can't strike out here!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Now then, Ms. Fey. Let me see what you've got.\"Mia:\nAs for the cause of death... ...I'd say this picture captures it quite well!Judge:\nWh-What!? But there is nothing that even remotely resembles a murder weapon here... Hmm, I'm afraid the defense is going to have to explain this in a bit more detail. Ms. Fey, where exactly in this photo is the murder weapon?Present downed power line\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Well, naturally... it's right here!\"Present anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nWell naturally... it's right around here! ...I think.\nJudge:\nMs. Fey, I'm deeply disappointed in you.\nPayne:\nI'm disappointed as well, Ms. Fey.\nGrossberg:\nTo be honest, I'm a bit disappointed too, Mia.\nPhoenix:\n... *achoo*\nMia:\n(Argh! I need to use my brain on this! Come on, Mia! You can't strike out here!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Ms. Fey, where exactly in this photo is the murder weapon?\"Mia:\nWell, naturally... it's right here!Judge:\nThat's... That's... What is that?Mia:\nA severed electrical cable, I believe... Your Honor. Remember the testimony we've heard. The machines the pharmacology students use in their experiments require high voltage... ...and because of that, there are special high-voltage cables strung up everywhere!Judge:\nSo then, the high-voltage cable...!Mia:\nYes, the high-voltage cable is the cause of death. That is the most likely explanation!Judge:\nHmm... That certainly sounds plausible. Well, Mr. Payne? What do you have to say about this?Payne:\nWell... I believe some praise is in order.Mia:\nDon't toy with me, old man!Payne:\nNow, now. The victim's cause of death may indeed have been a high-voltage cable. However! I want you to think about what that really implies! The only one who had the opportunity to use the cable as a murder weapon was... The defendant!Phoenix:\n... *achoo*Judge:\nHmm... That much is certainly true.Payne:\nYes, and that's not all. We have proof. Irrefutable proof that will establish that Mr. Wright was the murderer.Judge:\nY-You do!? Well, what is it!?Payne:\nHis fingerprints.Judge:\nFingerprints...? You mean that the defendant's fingerprints were on something besides the medicine bottle?Payne:\nLet's take another look at the crime scene photo. As you can see, the victim is wearing a leather jacket. And as you may know, leather holds fingerprints quite well.Mia:\nAh! Y-You mean...?Payne:\nYes. It was quite clearly imprinted on the chest area of the victim's jacket. The palm print of the defendant's very own hand!Judge:\nWh-Whaaat!?Payne:\nI can only think of one way Mr. Wright could have left a print like that. Intent on murder, he squarely pushed the victim towards the severed electrical cable!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! That's enough! I think we can conclude that there is no reason to continue with this cross-examination.Grossberg:\nStick a fork in us, we're done.Mia:\nM-Mr. Grossberg!Grossberg:\nMy hemorrhoids never lie. The show is over, Mia. I knew that boy was guilty the first time I saw him.Mia:\nN-No! You're wrong! Mr. Wright is innocent.Judge:\nNo further evidence is required to convince me of this man's guilt!Mia:\nY-Your Honor...!Judge:\nAt this time, I am prepared to render a verdict in this case!Mia:Judge:\nDo you have something further to add, Ms. Fey?Mia:\nIs this what you want, Mr. Wright!?Phoenix:\n...!Mia:\nYou still haven't told us the truth... the whole truth. If you don't say something now, the judge is going to hand down his verdict!Phoenix:\nB-But I... I can't! I-I just can't say it! If I told you what really happened, then I'd b-be...Mia:\nIt's OK, Mr. Wright. I'm your attorney. You can trust me.Phoenix:\nM-Miss Fey...Mia:\nNo matter what it is you have to say... I believe in you and I'll represent you to the very end.Phoenix:\n...!Payne:Payne:\nWe've already established the defendant's guilt. There's no further need for him to say anything.Phoenix:\n*cough* *cough* W-Wait a minute!Mia:\nMr. Wright...Phoenix:\nI... I'll tell you what really happened!Payne:Payne:\nBut I've already told you, Mr. Wright. There's no need for further...Phoenix:\n*cough* I-I-I... I did it... I admit it! I pushed him! It's my fault... My f-fault that D-Doug Swallow is dead!That girl... You shouldn't see her anymore.Hey! It's none of your business!I'm telling you for your sake. If you continue to see her, it's going to be bad news.Y-You're lying!Just listen to me. There's something you need to know about that girl......Stop it! D-Don't talk about her like that!Judge:\n... What you just said... Was that the truth!?Phoenix:\nY-Yes, I... I was afraid... Afraid that if I told the truth... ...everyone would think I was the murderer for sure!Judge:\nWell, as things currently stand, we're all absolutely convinced you are!Phoenix:\nP-Please...! Please give me one more chance to explain! This time I swear... I swear I'll tell the whole truth! It'll be OK, won't it, Miss Fey? I... I believe in you!Mia:\nOh! Um, th-thank you. (I still can't believe it... He really did push the victim...)Grossberg:\nUnnngh... It feels like my hemorrhoids are doing the Harlem Shake!Witness Testimony-- When I Pushed The Victim --Phoenix:\nThat guy... He was talking bad about Dollie...\nI lost my temper and gave him a shove!\nAt that moment, I heard some kind of loud noise...\nA little while after I left, I started to get worried.\nSo I went back. But h-he was just lying there, d-dead!Payne:\nWell, the explanation is really quite simple. When you pushed him, Mr. Swallow flew back and touched the electrical cable. He died from the shock. And that, as they say, is that.Judge:\nHmm... A simple explanation indeed.Payne:\nAt the time of the incident, a light rain had been falling. Wet from the rain, the victim was more easily electrocuted.Phoenix:\nB-But! When I pushed him, there weren't any electrical cables nearby! If there had been something like that, even I would've noticed it!Mia:\n(That's true... Even a dufus like him couldn't miss that!)Judge:\nHmm... Ms. Fey. Let me warn you right now that if your cross-examination doesn't yield any new facts... ...I intend to deliver my verdict without further delay. Are we clear on that?Mia:\nY-Yes, Your Honor. (Don't give up, Mia! If he is innocent, there must be some kind of evidence somewhere that will prove it!)Cross Examination-- When I Pushed The Victim --Phoenix:\nThat guy... He was talking bad about Dollie...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nSo what kinds of things did Mr. Swallow say to you?\nPhoenix:\nHe said all sorts of terrible things about Dollie! He said that she was a bad girl!\nPayne:\n...\nMia:\n...\nJudge:\n... Umm... Is that all?\nPhoenix:\nYup!\nJudge:\nWell, Ms. Fey, you heard him yourself.\nMia:\n(Oh boy! You're not doing yourself any favors here, Mr. Wright! Please don't make this harder for me than it already is!)\nPhoenix:\nAnyway... After he said that, I just, I just...Phoenix:\nI lost my temper and gave him a shove!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nCan you tell me about what happened in a little more detail?\nPhoenix:\nThat guy... He just said what he wanted to say to me... And then he put on the jacket he was holding and started to leave. That's when... That's when I lost my temper and flew into a furious frenzy! I just gave him a... light, gentle shove to the chest.\nMia:\nAnd when you did that, there was no severed cable anywhere to be seen?\nPhoenix:\nRight! There was nothing like that at all!\nPayne:\nBut is it possible that you merely overlooked it?\nPhoenix:\n... Well, I guess it's possible.\nMia:\n(What are you doing!? Don't let that guy steamroll over you like cheap asphalt!)\nJudge:\nI believe what's important here is the moment the push occurred. Let's continue on with the testimony, witness.Phoenix:\nAt that moment, I heard some kind of loud noise...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nA \"loud noise\"? And what would you say that loud noise was, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nI'm not sure... But it was really loud! It was like, \"SNAP!\"... You know, come to think of it, I wonder what that was...\nPayne:\nHee, hee, hee, hee... Clearly, Your Honor, it was the sound of the victim being electrocuted.\nMia:\n\nMia:\nY-You're not qualified to decide that! (What should I do? I'm treading on some dangerous ground here...)\n\n\n\nAsk for more details\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nMr. Wright, that \"loud noise\" you heard may be extremely important. So try to remember what it was!\nPhoenix:\nUmm, how do I put it... It was like a sharp crack. Aha! Could it... Could it have been...?\nMia:\nYes? Could it have been? Hurry up and tell us!\nPhoenix:\nWhen I pushed him, he dropped the umbrella he was holding. He fell right on top of it, and it broke. That was probably the noise I heard.\nJudge:\nAn umbrella, huh? And did that umbrella belong to the victim?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, it was a plastic umbrella. Cheap and frail, kind of like the owner! Then again, I wish I had any kind of umbrella. I was totally soaked to the bone.\nJudge:\nHmm... Ms. Fey. What do you think? Is there something important in that testimony just now?\nMia:\nUmm, well...\n\n\n\nOf course it's important!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n(This is it, Mia! The new information you've been waiting for!) Of course it's important! No! This cheap umbrella is more than important; it's vital! I want to officially have it entered into the testimony!\nPayne:\nHa! How perfectly fitting. Flimsy information for a flimsy lawyer!\nJudge:\nThe court agrees to the defense's request. Witness, please add the bit about the cheap umbrella to your testimony.\nChanges statement from \"At that moment, I heard some kind of loud noise...\" to \"After I shoved him, he... He fell down on top of his cheap umbrella.\"\n\n\n\n\nOf course it's not important!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nOf course it's not important!\nJudge:\nM-Ms. Fey! How can you state that so proudly!?\nMia:\nWell, it just isn't! It's not important one bit! Not even one iota. OK?\nGrossberg:\nMia! That's enough! You're making a fool of yourself!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Is it OK if I go on?\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave it alone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n(I've got other, more pressing things to ask about.) Very well, Mr. Wright, let's move on, shall we?\nLeads back to cross-examinationPhoenix:\nAfter I shoved him, he... He fell down on top of his cheap umbrella.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nSo Mr. Swallow fell on top of his umbrella? And you are certain of this?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. It was right there under him. Actually, if it hadn't been under him, I was planning on borrowing it for myself.\nMia:\nThe umbrella, you mean?\nPhoenix:\nWell yeah, you see I was wearing this sweater here... Dollie stayed up late for nights at a time knitting it for me... I didn't want the rain to dampen the handmade symbol of her love...\nGrossberg:\nOomph! My stomach is not to be used as your personal soccer ball, Mia!\nMia:\nAh! I-I'm so sorry!\nJudge:\nContinue on with your testimony, witness.Present Crime Photo 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Why didn't you testify about the umbrella from the very beginning?\"Phoenix:\nA little while after I left, I started to get worried.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nAfter you shoved the victim, did you leave the scene right away?\nPhoenix:\nYes, I did! I admit it! I-I was furious!\nPayne:\nYou left without even checking Mr. Swallow's condition?\nPhoenix:\nWell, um, yeah... But like I said, I got worried about him later.Phoenix:\nSo I went back. But h-he was just lying there, d-dead!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nAt that time, did you see anyone else at the scene of the crime?\nPhoenix:\n*cough* *cough*... *cough* *cough* *cough* Um, nope. Nobody...\nMia:\n(Geez. Could that stupid cough possibly sound any phonier?)\nJudge:\nHmm... In that case, it's very hard to believe someone else could have been the murderer...Grossberg:\nUnless we can find something that shows his innocence from that testimony, m'dear... I'm afraid the judge will make his final decision with no remorse whatsoever!Mia:\nY-Yes, sir! (Right now I need more info; info that will help me turn up some contradictions!)Mia:\nWhy didn't you testify about the umbrella from the very beginning?Phoenix:\nCome on... If I had mentioned that...Mia:\nI would've been able to counter the prosecution's arguments earlier!Payne:\nWh-What do you mean by that?Mia:\nTake another look at the crime scene photo! According to Mr. Wright, the victim fell on top of his umbrella. However, if you look closely... ...the umbrella is nowhere near the victim. Actually, it's by the electrical pole!Judge:\nY-You're absolutely right!Mia:\nThe conclusion here is obvious. After the defendant left, the victim moved from where he fell. In other words... After he was pushed by the defendant, Mr. Swallow was still alive!Payne:\nNnnnooooo!!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! The victim... He moved...!? Mr. Payne! The umbrella in this photo... Where is it now?Payne:\nW-Well, it was collected by the police at the crime scene...Judge:\nI want it presented as evidence immediately!Umbrella added to the Court Record.Payne:\nB-But the umbrella could have simply been blown there by the wind!Mia:Mia:\nAccording to the testimony, the victim fell on top of the umbrella. There's simply no way it could have been blown there by the wind!Payne:\nNnn... Gggg... Hrrmph! B-B-But...!Judge:\nI know this matter of the umbrella seems relatively trivial... But as long as the smallest doubt remains, I cannot render final judgment!Payne:\nN-N-N... Noooooooooooooooooooooo!!!Judge:\nI must say, I still find it hard to believe... (Changed from [However, I still find it hard to believe that a huge hole has been blown in the...] in the original release) that a huge hole has been blown in the prosecution's case by the defendant's testimony. (Changed from [...prosecution's case by the defendant's testimony.] in the original release)Phoenix's Testimony added to the Court Record.Grossberg:\nWell done, Mia!Payne:\n......Hee hee. Hee hee hee hee hee...Judge:\nMr. Payne! What are you chuckling about?Payne:\nPardon me, Your Honor. It seems I was expecting too much of a free ride. It was foolish to think I could establish guilt through cross-examination alone.Judge:\nI'm afraid I don't follow what you're saying!Mia:\n... Let me guess. You have another witness.Payne:\nExactly! And this witness's testimony will be incontrovertible!Judge:\nWell!? Who is this witness!?Payne:\nMs. Dahlia Hawthorne.Judge:\nDahlia Hawthorne? You don't mean... \"Dollie\"?Payne:\nI do, Your Honor. The defendant's very own lover is a witness to the whole thing! That's right. She was at the scene of the crime when the murder took place!Judge:\nWhaaaat!?Payne:\nI'm sorry to break the bad news to you, my dear.Mia:\n... \"Bad news\"? You couldn't be more wrong. Actually... I've been waiting for this.Payne:\nYou can't be serious...Grossberg:\nMia! What do you mean by that...?Judge:\nI think this is a good point for us to stop at. Court will now enter a 20 minute recess. Afterwards, we will listen to the testimony of Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne.April 11, 11:52 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3Phoenix:\nMiss Fey... I-I'm sorry about what happened back there... I... I...Mia:\nIt's alright. At least you told us the truth in the end, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nYeah... So I guess I can start to relax then, huh?Grossberg:\nRelax, my boy? You can't be serious! After hiding such important facts...Phoenix:\nB-But...! But the next witness is my Dollie, right? She'll save me! I just know she will!Mia:\nWhy do you think that?Phoenix:\nHuh!? What do you mean!? She... She's the love of my life, that's why!Mia:\nThe love of your life, huh... Would you mind telling me more about you and... Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne?Phoenix:\nSure! No problem! Dollie and I... We first met about eight months ago right here in this very courthouse. Actually, I'm studying to be a lawyer, on the side... Anyway! One day, she and I just bumped into each other in the reading room downstairs. That's why I really think it was fate that brought us together. As soon as I first set eyes on her, I knew she was the one for me. Oh, here! Take a look at this!Mia:\n...!Phoenix:\nShe gave this to me the day we met as a symbol of our love! She had been wearing it around her neck that day, but then... ...she took it off, but before she gave it to me she said, \"I want you to carry this.\"Grossberg:\nSo she gave it to you as a present, I see.Phoenix:\nThis darling little bottle is filled with memories of my darling little Dollie!Mia:\nIt certainly is a little bottle alright.Phoenix:\nIt makes me so happy, I show it to everyone I meet! I want to share my happiness with the whole world!Dahlia's Present borrowed from Phoenix Wright.Mia:\nUm, anyway... So after that, you and Ms. Hawthorne started dating?Phoenix:\nYeah, but she's so shy. Every time I see her, she always says the same thing to me. \"Please give it back now.\"Grossberg:\nWhat a strange girl, asking for a present back like that...Mia:\nBy the way, Mr. Wright. The day you first met Dahlia Hawthorne, eight months ago... It wouldn't happen to have been on August 27th, would it?Phoenix:\nHuh...? Y-Yeah, it was... But how did you...?Mia:\nThis happened on August 27th, right here in this courthouse.Phoenix:\nWhat's this? A newspaper clipping? Let's see... \"Murder in the Courthouse?\" M-Murder?Grossberg:\nWhat are you reading there!? Let me see that! .........! Oh, I see. Mia... I think I understand what you're trying to say. And I think I understand why you suddenly took such a keen interest in this case. You believe there is some connection between these two cases. Am I correct? (Changed from [You believe there is some relationship between these two cases. Am I correct?] in the original release)Newspaper Clipping added to the Court Record.Mia:\nI hope you don't mind, Mr. Grossberg... I... I need to finish this myself.Grossberg:\nAh, yes, but... I'm afraid what you have will not be enough, m'dear. I'll go and have a look at the downstairs reading room and see what else I can find.Mia:\nTh-Thank you!Grossberg:\nI want to do whatever I can to be of help to you, Mia! Well, it looks like recess is about over. We'd better all get moving!Mia:\n(I guess so... That recess sure seemed longer than 20 minutes though...)To be continued.April 11, 12:13 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt will now reconvene. Mr. Payne, please call your witness.Payne:\nThis next person is someone who witnessed the crime as it happened. The prosecution calls Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne to the stand!Payne:\n...Judge:\n...Mia:\n(Wh-What's with this stiff silence...?)Judge:\nIn my long career as a judge, I have been deceived by many witnesses. It's my job to doubt; to take no one at their word... But in your case, I must admit that you radiate a glow of complete sincerity.Mia:\n(I can't believe he actually said that!)Payne:\nOh! Um, now then, witness. Could you please state your full name?Dahlia:\n... I, umm...Judge:\nDon't worry, sweetie. There's no need to be nervous!Payne:\nIf anyone says anything rude, you can be sure, I'll cut them right down to size!Judge:\nAnd I will bash them with my gavel!Mia:\n(I love how they look straight at me when they say that...)Dahlia:\nUm, thank you... for calming my nerves. You are all so nice... I almost feel right at home.Payne:\nNot at all!Judge:\nIt was nothing!Mia:\nIf we may move on now... What is your full name and occupation?Dahlia:\nMy name is Dahlia Hawthorne. I'm a junior in Literature at Ivy University. I just want to say... It's an honor for me to be here in your noble presence.Payne:\nThe honor is all mine!Judge:\nNo... The honor is all mine.Mia:\n(Well, we know whose milkshake brings all the boys to the yard...)Dahlia:\n...Umm. Sir?Payne:\nIs there something I can help you with?Judge:\nYou just go on and say whatever is on your mind!Dahlia:\nI'm sure that there must be some kind of mistake. Feenie wouldn't kill anyone. I just know it!Judge:\nYes, yes... I can see why you'd say that.Mia:\n(She's going to be a tough witness, alright... It only took her 12 seconds to wrap them all around her little finger.)Judge:\nNow then, please proceed with your testimony. Let's hear about what you witnessed on the day of the incident, if you please.Witness Testimony-- What I Witnessed --Dahlia:\nI had been planning to go back to Feenie's place after class was over.\nFeenie and Dougie... They were talking behind the building.\nThen suddenly... Dougie got all wobbly and just collapsed.\nThat's when Feenie noticed that I was there.\nI went to go and find some other students and they called the authorities.Judge:\nI-I don't know what to say! According to you, Ms. Hawthorne... ...the defendant didn't do anything wrong!Payne:Payne:\nYoung lady. As old as I am, even I recall how hot the flames of young passion can burn. Nevertheless... It is my job to discover the truth. Please, tell us the truth...Dahlia:\nBut... But, I... I would never...Mia:Mia:\nThat's more than enough, witness. I won't allow this to continue.Judge:\nWh-What do you mean by that?Mia:\nPlease, just let me proceed with my cross-examination, Your Honor. I, for one, don't plan to win my case on a bunch of paper-thin lies!Dahlia:\n...Tee hee. You haven't changed a bit... Mia Fey.Mia:\n...Payne:\nWhat's this? So, you two are... acquainted?Mia:\nYes. We've met before... Once.Dahlia:\n...Judge:\nIn any case, Ms. Fey, the floor is all yours.Dahlia:\nIt's good to see you again, Madame Fey!Mia:\n\"Madame\"!? (I'm no one's grandma yet, girlie!)Cross Examination-- What I Witnessed --Dahlia:\nI had been planning to go back to Feenie's place after class was over.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nNow, unless I'm mistaken, Feenie -- I mean, Mr. Wright is in the Art Department. If that's the case, then what were you doing by the Pharmacology building?\nDahlia:\nWell... I'm in the Literature Department. I'm studying Japanese Senryu poetry.\nJudge:\nOho hoh! How wonderful! It's that humorous, yet satirical style of haiku, yes?\nDahlia:\n\"Nothing left to do... When a man reaches this age, sleep is his best friend.\"\nMia:\n(That's supposed to be poetry? Sounds more like a mid-life crisis!)\nDahlia:\nFor me to get to the Art Department, I have to walk through that back area.\nJudge:\nAh, yes I see. That makes sense. When I want to enter the courthouse, I always walk through the front doors.\nMia:\n(How else would you enter? Teleportation!?)Dahlia:\nFeenie and Dougie...They were talking behind the building.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nSo who is this \"Dougie\" person?\nDahlia:\nOh, I'm sorry. Doug Swallow. We were dating until about eight months ago...\nMia:\nSo what were Dougie-- *ahem* Mr. Swallow and Mr. Wright talking about anyway?\nDahlia:\n... H-How can you be so mean? I would never... I would never eavesdrop... I wasn't raised to be so rude and unrefined!\nPayne:\nThat's right, Ms. Fey!\nJudge:\nDon't drag the witness down to your level!\nMia:\n(Why am I being demonized here?)\nJudge:\nPlease, go on. What did you see next?Dahlia:\nThen suddenly... Dougie got all wobbly and just collapsed.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nAre you saying that the victim just collapsed on his own?\nDahlia:\nY-Yes.\nMia:\nIn other words, the defendant never touched the victim. Is that right?\nDahlia:\nI was watching the whole time. Feenie never did a thing to Dougie!\nMia:\n(If I press her for no good reason, I just know the judge will get angry with me... Hmm, so what should I do about her testimony just now?)\n\n\n\nLeave it alone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n(Hmm... I suppose her statement works in our favor, for now. I'll hold off on looking into it any deeper until it's necessary.)\nJudge:\nVery well, young lady, please go on with your testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nShow contradiction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nFeeble lies are not very becoming, Ms. Hawthorne, so let's drop them, shall we?\nDahlia:\nWh-What...! I...! I would never...!\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nMs. Fey! I will not allow you to badger this witness!\nMia:\n...\nPayne:\nI-I believe the defense is engaged in a-a... fishing expedition.\nMia:\n...\nPayne:\nThat is... Err... She has no supporting...\nMia:\n...\nPayne:\nP-Please don't glare at me like that...! I-I'm just doing my job!\nMia:\nNow then, Ms. Hawthorne. The defendant's palmprint was found on Mr. Swallow's leather jacket. It has already been shown that Mr. Wright did, in fact, push the victim.\nDahlia:\nWhat...?\nMia:\nThere's no need to try to cover for the defendant. It would be much better if you came out and told us the whole truth.\nJudge:\nHmm... There's nothing to worry about, young lady. Just tell us everything that you saw.\nDahlia:\nY-Yes, Your Honor... I-I will. If you don't mind, I-I'd like to revise my testimony.\nMia:\n(Looks like we're finally getting somewhere...)\nChanges statement from \"Then suddenly... Dougie got all wobbly and just collapsed.\" to \"Um, actually, I didn't see the moment he pushed Dougie.\"\nChanges statement from \"That's when Feenie noticed that I was there.\" to \"It didn't look like they were fighting, and I didn't hear anything unusual either.\"Dahlia:\nUm, actually, I didn't see the moment he pushed Dougie.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nYou didn't see it!?\nDahlia:\nWell, I saw the moment when Dougie fell to the ground...\nPayne:\nAnd at that time, there was only the two of them at the scene? The defendant, Phoenix Wright, and the victim, Doug Swallow?\nDahlia:\nYes... that's right.Dahlia:\nThat's when Feenie noticed that I was there.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nAnd what did Mr. Wright say when he saw you?\nDahlia:\nI-I'm sorry. I-I was so flustered that I... I really don't remember. P-Please forgive me.\nMia:\nYou don't remember...?\nJudge:\nWell, that's common enough. Sometimes I can't recall a sentence I passed only minutes prior!\nMia:\n(Please... Someone, anyone... Stop him before he gets hurt... by me.)Dahlia:\nIt didn't look like they were fighting, and I didn't hear anything unusual either. (Changed from [It didn't look like they were fighting, and I didn't hear any noise either.] in the original release)Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nSo then, what did it look like they were doing to you?\nDahlia:\nI thought they were having a nice, friendly afternoon conversation.\nMia:\n(Oh, give me a break!)\nDahlia:\nThat's why I really wasn't watching them all that closely.\nJudge:\nDid you notice anything out of the ordinary at all?\nDahlia:\nNo, nothing at all... Mr. Judge.\nJudge:\nOh, I like the sound of that! \"Mr. Judge\"... Now then, please proceed with your testimony.Present Phoenix's Testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"You say you \"didn't hear anything unusual\". Is that correct?\"Dahlia:\nI went to go and find some other students and they called the authorities.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nWhen you say \"students\" do you mean students from the Pharmacology Department?\nDahlia:\nYes. They're all very fond of their drugs...\nMia:\nPlease try to stay on topic! So to find some Pharmacology students, you went to the labs, correct?\nDahlia:\nThat's what I was planning to do... But in the end, I wound up not going. A group of about 10 research students came running out of the building entrance. Somehow they all seemed to know what was going on...\nMia:\n(The students knew what was going on...?)\n\n\n\nLeave it alone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n(The Pharmacology students... They have nothing to do with the incident. I think what I need is more information about Dahlia herself.)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress for more details\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nBut how could the students have known what was going on?\nDahlia:\nWell... I don't know for sure that they knew what had happened. It's just, they all seemed kind of excited about something.\nMia:\n(Hmm... It doesn't look like I'm going to get any more info about the students.)\nPayne:\nSo did the students call the police?\nDahlia:\nY-Yes. I-I was just so... I was so panicked...\nJudge:\nHmm. Yes, well anyone would have been, my dear.\nLeads back to cross-examinationMia:\n(That girl... She's telling a super obvious lie, and she knows it. She's just pretending to protect Mr. Wright... Yes, that's got to be it! Way to go, Mia! OK, that means I'm going to have to dig deep to find the contradiction on this one!)Mia:\nYou say you \"didn't hear anything unusual\". Is that correct? (Changed from [You say you didn't hear any noise. Is that correct?] in the original release)Dahlia:\nYes. That's why I was very relaxed, looking at the scenery around me.Mia:\nThat's nice, but I find that just a little odd. I have here, the testimony of your boyfriend, Mr. Phoenix Wright. And he clearly testified to the effect... ...that when he pushed the victim, he heard a sharp, loud noise.Dahlia:\nH-He said that?Mia:\nIf you were really that close to the two of them, why didn't you hear this noise as well?Dahlia:\nI...!Payne:Payne:\nW-Well, maybe the noise just wasn't all that memorable.Mia:Mia:\nBut according to Mr. Wright's testimony, it was a sharp noise like a \"SNAP\"! There's no way a noise like that could fail to make an impression!Payne:\nAck!!Dahlia:\nUmm... May I have a moment to answer?Judge:\nB-By all means!Dahlia:\nI know the reason why I didn't hear the noise. You see, the truth is... I had my headphones on, and I was listening to music at the time.Payne:\nH-H-Headphones...? You mean that both of your ears were covered?Dahlia:\nThe rain was just beginning to let up... But it seemed as though Thor wasn't ready for his fun to come to an end yet. So the sky continued to flash and rumble.Mia:\nThunder and lightning, huh...Dahlia:\nYes, I'm afraid of the sound of thunder. So I put my headphones on to block it out...Payne:\nHee, hee, hee, hee... Well, Your Honor? As you can see, there weren't any contradictions in her testimony after all.Judge:\nHmm...Mia:\n(Wait a sec, Mia! That testimony just now... She said something that could totally change this whole case!)She didn't hear anything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nYour Honor! There is a problem with the witness's testimony!\nJudge:\nWh-What do you mean!?\nPayne:\nWh-What is this \"problem\"!?\nMia:\nIt's obvious. The problem is that the witness claims to have not heard the \"SNAP!\"\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nA-Are you deaf!? Did you pay attention to the testimony!? She said she didn't hear it because she was listening to music with her headphones!\nJudge:\nMs. Fey! I'm surprised you're going senile before me!\nMia:\n(I'm not THAT bad! ...I think.)\nJudge:\nWell, the testimony we've just heard seems to be very decisive. The only one that could have killed the victim was the defendant, Mr. Phoenix Wright!\nDahlia:\nN-No! Please...! I-I never meant to incriminate him!\nMia:\n(This is bad, Mia! If you don't do something, we're going to lose this!! Think again! What is it about this testimony that doesn't make sense...?)\nLeads back to:\n\"She said something that could totally change this whole case!)\"She was listening to music.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nYour Honor! There is a problem with the witness's testimony!\nJudge:\nWh-What do you mean!?\nPayne:\nWh-What is this \"problem\"!?\nMia:\nIt's obvious. The problem is that she claims to have been listening to music!\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nA-Are you deaf!? Did you pay attention to the testimony!? She explained she was listening to music to cover up the sound of thunder!\nJudge:\nMs. Fey! I must warn you that I can be even more frightening than Zeus when I'm angry!\nMia:\n(Yikes! I'm in trouble now!)\nJudge:\nWell, the testimony we've just heard seems to be very decisive. The only one that could have killed the victim was the defendant, Mr. Phoenix Wright!\nDahlia:\nN-No! Please...! I-I never meant to incriminate him!\nMia:\n(This is bad, Mia! If you don't do something, we're going to lose this!! Think again! What is it about this testimony that doesn't make sense...?)\nLeads back to:\n\"She said something that could totally change this whole case!)\"There was lightning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor! There is a problem with the witness's testimony!\"Mia:\nYour Honor! There is a problem with the witness's testimony!Judge:\nWh-What do you mean!?Mia:\nDidn't you notice? She said there was lightning, correct?Judge:\nYes... What about it?Mia:\nWell, lightning is actually a large discharge of electricity in the atmosphere, am I right?Judge:\nNow's not the time for a science lesson, Ms. Fey!Mia:\nYes, Your Honor. Anyway, since the cause of death was electrocution... ...isn't it possible that the victim died from being hit by a bolt of lightning!?Judge:\nOh!Payne:\nAh!Dahlia:\n...!Judge:\nHmm... I must admit that the thought had not occurred to me!Mia:\n(Just what kind of thoughts DO occur to this guy anyway?) This entire case is built on the premise that Mr. Doug Swallow was \"murdered\"... ...but that very premise itself is mistaken! The defense believes that Mr. Swallow was, in fact, the victim of a stray bolt!Judge:\nI-It appears the defense may be on to something! Could it be that the death was actually accidental?Mia:\n(Alright, you did it, Mia! I'll be taking that \"Not Guilty\" now if you don't--)Payne:Payne:\nHee, hee, hee, hee, hee... I'm hurt that you have such a low opinion of me, Ms. Fey.Mia:\nHuh...?Payne:\nI'm not a fool, you know. The prosecution has done its research, Your Honor. We found that there were no lightning strikes on that day at that location!Mia:\nWhaaa!?Payne:\nWhat's more... We have evidence that the electrical cable is definitely linked to this case.Judge:\nE-Evidence, Mr. Payne!? Well, what is this evidence?Payne:\nThis affidavit.Judge:\nAnd who is this affidavit from?Payne:\nThe Pharmacology students who were conducting experiments in their labs that day. Allow me to read out to the court the testimony of the Pharmacology students. \"All equipment in the labs lost power all of a sudden at around 3:00 PM that day.\"Judge:\nWas it a blackout?Payne:\nAll of the labs' equipment runs of high-voltage, Your Honor.Mia:\nSo you're saying the equipment lost power because...Payne:\nPrecisely. They lost power because of the severed electrical cable. The power outage occurred at approximately 3:00 PM...Judge:\nWhich fits with the time of death listed in the autopsy report.Payne:\nExactly! In other words... The victim died as a result of touching the severed electrical cable. According to the students, the cables were very old. They were planning on having them replaced in the near future.Judge:\nHmm, I see...Payne:\nApparently the cables had become so brittle... ...that even the smallest bump would've caused them to break.Students' Testimony added to the Court Record.Judge:\nHowever... There is one thing that troubles me. If the cable could have been broken by any small bump... ...then it wouldn't have snapped if it hadn't been bumped into, correct?Payne:\nW-Well... I suppose you could say that.Judge:\nHmm, Ms. Fey. Do you have any thoughts regarding the cause of the severed cable?Mia:\nY-Your Honor... (I don't like how this is looking one bit! I have to come up with something to try to regain some momentum!) If it pleases the court, the defense would like to state its opinion.Judge:\nWell then, let's hear it. Who or what was it that caused the cable to break?Present Phoenix's Testimony or Phoenix Wright profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor. Please think back to Mr. Wright's testimony.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nThis is it! This is why the cable snapped.\nPayne:\nWell, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nI believe that the only thing that has snapped is the mind of the defense.\nPayne:\nAh, that was one of your best lines yet, Your Honor.\nMia:\nNnnfff...! (Ouch, that was harsh...) Please, Your Honor! Give me one more chance!\nLeads back to:\n\"Well then, let's hear it.\"Mia:\nYour Honor. Please think back to Mr. Wright's testimony.Judge:\nThe defendant's testimony?Mia:\nHe said that after he pushed the victim, he heard a loud, sharp noise. Now, this happened at around 3:00 PM, correct?Judge:\nYes, that sounds right. Wait! Are you saying that...Mia:\nThe lab equipment lost power at 2:55 PM... which fits right in Mr. Wright's timeline. In other words, it was Mr. Wright's shove that caused the power outage.Payne:\nYes! The prosecution also came to that same conclusion. And it was that very shove that caused Mr. Swallow to be electrocuted!Mia:Mia:\nI'm afraid I can't agree with you there, Mr. Payne.Payne:\nWh-What's that supposed to mean?Mia:\nTake a good look at where the victim landed after being shoved. See the umbrella? It's by the electrical pole. That's right. The victim banged into that pole as a result of being pushed. It was that impact that caused the cable to break.Judge:\nHmm... Well, that makes sense. And then the victim was electrocuted.Mia:\nI'm sorry Your Honor, but no. It doesn't make sense at all. If the victim was shoved into the far pole... ...then he couldn't have been electrocuted by this severed cable in the foreground here!Payne:\nAAAAAAAAAAHH!!Mia:\nIn other words... Someone other than my client must have electrocuted the victim!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court!Mia:\n(Ah, the lamentations of my enemy. How I've longed to hear them!)Judge:\nIt-It's true... The defense is absolutely correct! There doesn't seem to be any way the defendant could have done it--Dahlia:\nUmm... Mr. Judge, sir? May I say something? The madame attorney's explanation... She said some things that are a little different than I remember them.Judge:\nWh-Wh-Payne:\nWh-Wh-Mia:\nWhat the...!?Dahlia:\nPlease, just once more. May I please testify one last time? Please... Mr. Judge?Judge:\nOf course it's alright! Just go right ahead and give your new testimony!Mia:\n(This is it... She's finally starting to show her true colors!)Witness Testimony-- What I Witnessed, Part 2 --Dahlia:\nThe truth is... Feenie pushed him twice.\nThe first time was into the electrical pole. That's when the cable broke.\nThen Dougie tried his best to run away from him...\nBut Feenie caught up and crashed into him from behind.\nThe cable snapping, and Dougie being electrocuted -- it all occured [sic] in less than a minute.Judge:\nHmm... So after being shoved... ...the victim got up and tried to run away.Payne:\nAnd that is when the defendant pushed him for the second time.Dahlia:\nI'm so sorry, Feenie... But I... I just have to tell the truth. Am I doing the right thing? Am I, Mr. Judge?Judge:\nOf course you are, my dear! As painful as it may seem, you are. Now then, Ms. Fey. You may proceed with your cross-examination!Cross Examination-- What I Witnessed, Part 2 --Dahlia:\nThe truth is... Feenie pushed him twice.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nMs. Hawthorne... Previously in your testimony you said the following... \"Actually, I didn't see the moment he pushed Dougie.\"\nDahlia:\nI know... I-I'm sorry. I wanted to protect Feenie.\nMia:\nSo that's why you basically lied to the court?\nDahlia:\nI was a bad girl... I know... Um, Mr. Judge?\nJudge:\nY-Yes?\nDahlia:\nWould you please, please forgive little old me?\nMia:\nOf course he won't! What you did is called \"perjury\"...\nJudge:\nOh, come now! It was just a little old white lie! We'll forget it this time! But please be more careful from now on, alright?\nDahlia:\nOh, thank you so much, Mr. Judge.\nJudge:\nNot at all! Ho ho ho...!\nMia:\n(The judge had better be more careful himself! A dark alley is friendlier than that girl!)Dahlia:\nThe first time was into the electrical pole. That's when the cable broke.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nYou're saying you actually saw the victim get pushed into the electrical pole?\nDahlia:\nI know he doesn't look it, but Feenie can be a bit of an imp when he wants to be.\nMia:\n(Oh, really...?)\nDahlia:\nBut I never imagined that he would cause an electrical cable to break... Feenie really is scary when he gets mad...\nJudge:\nYes, he sounds like a very dangerous individual indeed.Dahlia:\nthen Dougie tried his best to run away from him...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nSo let me get this straight. You were happily listening to music on your headphones while you watched this scene unfold?\nDahlia:\nWaaaaah...\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nMs. Fey! I'll have to ask you to stop badgering the witness!\nDahlia:\nUmm... I wasn't happy... I was so scared that I couldn't even move. All I could do was stand there and cheer them on...\nMia:\nCh-Cheer them on? What do you mean by that?\nDahlia:\nWell, I wished the best for them both, and that they would each give the fight their all.\nJudge:\nHmm... That's very sweet of you to be so supportive.\nPayne:\nAnd what happened after that?Dahlia:\nBut Feenie caught up and crashed into him from behind.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nThat doesn't sound quite right... There were handprints found on the chest of the victim's leather jacket. Mr. Payne, were there also prints found on the back of his leather jacket?\nPayne:\nW-Well, um... N-No, there weren't...\nDahlia:\nMadame Fey, may I suggest that you listen a little more carefully?\nMia:\n...!?\nDahlia:\nI said that he \"crashed\" into him from behind, right? My Feenie wouldn't leave any prints behind in that case, would he?\nMia:\nUnngghh...Dahlia:\nThe cable snapping, and Dougie being electrocuted -- it all occured [sic] in less than a minute.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nDid you actually witness the moment the victim was electrocuted?\nDahlia:\nI-I'm sorry. I didn't actually see it. I... I turned my eyes away...\nPayne:\nThat's understandable.\nJudge:\nYes indeed. It would have been a horrific sight for anyone to behold.Present Crime Photo 2 or Students' Testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"That's enough, witness.\"Mia:\n(If I don't figure out the contradiction here... ...it's all over! She didn't have much time to come up with her lie, so this is my best chance. There must be a hole in her testimony somewhere! Think, Mia!)Mia:\nThat's enough, witness.Dahlia:\nI'm afraid I don't understand...Mia:\nYou will in a minute. Could you please take a look at this picture?Dahlia:\nOh. That medicine... That's the one Feenie likes to take for his cold.Mia:\nIt's not the medicine I want you to look at... It's the wristwatch. It stopped at the precise time the victim was electrocuted. In other words... 3:05 PM.Judge:\nYes, and your point is, Ms. Fey...?Mia:\nMy point is this! What time was it when the lab suffered that power outage due to the cable snapping?Payne:\nWell, according to the students' testimony, the answer is clear. It was 2:55 PM... Yeeaaaaaaarrrgghhh!!Mia:\nWould you care to explain to the court, Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne... ...what exactly happened during this 10 minute interval!?Dahlia:\n...!Mia:\nThe defense proposes that... ...it was during this interval that the real murderer killed Mr. Doug Swallow!Judge:\nOr-Order! Order in the court! What is this all ab--Payne:Payne:\nTh-This is nonsense! The \"real murderer\"...!?Mia:Mia:\nEven you can't deny that the time between the cable breaking and the electrocution... ...are completely unaccounted for!Payne:Payne:\nTh-Then who was it!? Who else are you saying could've done it!?Mia:\nThere's only one person who could have murdered Mr. Swallow. Only after my client had left the scene... ...was there a window of opportunity for the real killer!Judge:\nMs. Fey. Is the defense ready to indict someone as this \"real killer\"?Mia:\n(It's finally time. This is the moment I've been waiting for.) Yes, Your Honor. We are ready.Judge:\nVery well. But remember! If you accuse the wrong person, you will be penalized. Think very carefully before you speak, Ms. Fey. Now then, Ms. Fey. Let's have it. Who is the \"real killer\"!?Present Dahlia Hawthorne profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"It could only have been you, Dahlia Hawthorne!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nJudge:\n...\nPayne:\n......\nDahlia:\n.........\nJudge:\nWhat's that supposed to be!?\nMia:\nErr... Umm... A bout of youthful indiscretion! ...Your Honor!\nJudge:\nMaybe so, but I still have to penalize you.\nMia:\n(Unngggh... No way! I won't let it end like this!)\nJudge:\nNow this time, I expect you to think a bit more carefully!\nLeads back to:\n\"Now then, Ms. Fey. Let's have it. Who is the \"real killer\"!?\"Mia:\nIt could only have been you, Dahlia Hawthorne!Dahlia:\nWaaaaah! H-How... H-How can you...!Payne:Payne:\nTh-The defense is grasping at straws!Mia:\nTen minutes passed between the time the cable broke and the time of the electrocution! What exactly were you doing that whole time, Ms. Hawthorne? Were you really listening to some music while \"cheering them both on\" as they fought? I find it hard to believe that you didn't lift a finger to stop the men \"dearest\" to you!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Ms. Fey! Wh-What... I mean, why... That is to say...Mia:\nMs. Hawthorne! I believe you did witness the two men fighting on that day. However! After Mr. Wright pushed the victim, and subsequently left the scene... ...it was YOU who pushed Mr. Swallow to his death by your very own hands!Dahlia:\nAAAAAAAAHHH!!! H-How can you say something so mean, Madame Fey...! I... I didn't do anything...!Judge:\nMs. Fey! This is a very serious charge you are--Phoenix:Phoenix:\nYour Honor! P-Please, I have something I want to say! *achoo*Judge:\nY-Y-You! Wh-What is it!?Phoenix:\nPlease... Please strike everything the defense said just now from the record!Mia:\nWhat the...!? Are you daft!?Phoenix:\nYou're totally wrong, Miss Fey! Dollie... She... She couldn't do something like that!Judge:\nMr. Wright!! Get back in your seat! Bailiff! Grab that man!Phoenix:\nAaaarrgghh... *achoo* *achoo* Leave my Dollie alone! *achoo* *cough*???:\n... *sigh* That boy...Grossberg:\nHe's gotten himself in way over his head.Mia:\nOh...! Mr. Grossberg! You're back!Grossberg:\nIt seems I've arrived just in the nick of time. I found the police report on that incident in your newspaper clipping!Police Report added to the Court Record.Mia:\nThank you so much! This is exactly what I was hoping for!Grossberg:\nYou'd better take a good look at it... It... err... details how you came to lose your boyfriend.Judge:\nNow then, the defense has made a very serious accusation. Mr. Payne, what do you have to say about this?Payne:\nW-Well really, Your Honor... I... I... That is I...Dahlia: \nMay I interrupt you for just a moment, Mr. Prosecutor?Payne:\nAh, don't you worry, my dear.

G-G-Go right ahead.Dahlia:\nMadame Fey, are you seriously accusing me of killing my sweet Dougie?Mia:\nYes. I am.

Sorry. P-Please go ahead.Dahlia:\nHow can you say that!? I'm absolutely devoted to my dear Feenie. The notion that I would try to frame him is ludicrous!

Well I have evidence that suggests that she, in fact, had a very good reason!Judge:\nVery well then, the court grants the defense's request. Young lady. Would you mind staying on for just a bit longer?Dahlia:\nOf course not, Mr. Judge.Mia:\n(Get ready for the battle of your life, Dahlia Hawthorne!)Witness Testimony-- How I Met My Feenie --Dahlia:\nI first met my darling Feenie eight months ago.\nIt's like we were destined to meet in this very courthouse's basement reading room.\nThe moment our eyes met, my heart skipped a beat!\nWe've been going out ever since that fateful day.Phoenix:\nWe're so lovey-wuvey we literally make people sick! It's just jealousy, I think...Judge:\nMr. Wright!

      "newContext": "-- What I Witnessed, Part 2 --Dahlia:\nThe truth is... Feenie pushed him twice.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nMs. Hawthorne... Previously in your testimony you said the following... \"Actually, I didn't see the moment he pushed Dougie.\"\nDahlia:\nI know... I-I'm sorry. I wanted to protect Feenie.\nMia:\nSo that's why you basically lied to the court?\nDahlia:\nI was a bad girl... I know... Um, Mr. Judge?\nJudge:\nY-Yes?\nDahlia:\nWould you please, please forgive little old me?\nMia:\nOf course he won't! What you did is called \"perjury\"...\nJudge:\nOh, come now! It was just a little old white lie! We'll forget it this time! But please be more careful from now on, alright?\nDahlia:\nOh, thank you so much, Mr. Judge.\nJudge:\nNot at all! Ho ho ho...!\nMia:\n(The judge had better be more careful himself! A dark alley is friendlier than that girl!)Dahlia:\nThe first time was into the electrical pole. That's when the cable broke.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nYou're saying you actually saw the victim get pushed into the electrical pole?\nDahlia:\nI know he doesn't look it, but Feenie can be a bit of an imp when he wants to be.\nMia:\n(Oh, really...?)\nDahlia:\nBut I never imagined that he would cause an electrical cable to break... Feenie really is scary when he gets mad...\nJudge:\nYes, he sounds like a very dangerous individual indeed.Dahlia:\nthen Dougie tried his best to run away from him...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nSo let me get this straight. You were happily listening to music on your headphones while you watched this scene unfold?\nDahlia:\nWaaaaah...\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nMs. Fey! I'll have to ask you to stop badgering the witness!\nDahlia:\nUmm... I wasn't happy... I was so scared that I couldn't even move. All I could do was stand there and cheer them on...\nMia:\nCh-Cheer them on? What do you mean by that?\nDahlia:\nWell, I wished the best for them both, and that they would each give the fight their all.\nJudge:\nHmm... That's very sweet of you to be so supportive.\nPayne:\nAnd what happened after that?Dahlia:\nBut Feenie caught up and crashed into him from behind.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nThat doesn't sound quite right... There were handprints found on the chest of the victim's leather jacket. Mr. Payne, were there also prints found on the back of his leather jacket?\nPayne:\nW-Well, um... N-No, there weren't...\nDahlia:\nMadame Fey, may I suggest that you listen a little more carefully?\nMia:\n...!?\nDahlia:\nI said that he \"crashed\" into him from behind, right? My Feenie wouldn't leave any prints behind in that case, would he?\nMia:\nUnngghh...Dahlia:\nThe cable snapping, and Dougie being electrocuted -- it all occured [sic] in less than a minute.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nDid you actually witness the moment the victim was electrocuted?\nDahlia:\nI-I'm sorry. I didn't actually see it. I... I turned my eyes away...\nPayne:\nThat's understandable.\nJudge:\nYes indeed. It would have been a horrific sight for anyone to behold.Present Crime Photo 2 or Students' Testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"That's enough, witness.\"Mia:\n(If I don't figure out the contradiction here... ...it's all over! She didn't have much time to come up with her lie, so this is my best chance. There must be a hole in her testimony somewhere! Think, Mia!)Mia:\nThat's enough, witness.Dahlia:\nI'm afraid I don't understand...Mia:\nYou will in a minute. Could you please take a look at this picture?Dahlia:\nOh. That medicine... That's the one Feenie likes to take for his cold.Mia:\nIt's not the medicine I want you to look at... It's the wristwatch. It stopped at the precise time the victim was electrocuted. In other words... 3:05 PM.Judge:\nYes, and your point is, Ms. Fey...?Mia:\nMy point is this! What time was it when the lab suffered that power outage due to the cable snapping?Payne:\nWell, according to the students' testimony, the answer is clear. It was 2:55 PM... Yeeaaaaaaarrrgghhh!!Mia:\nWould you care to explain to the court, Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne... ...what exactly happened during this 10 minute interval!?Dahlia:\n...!Mia:\nThe defense proposes that... ...it was during this interval that the real murderer killed Mr. Doug Swallow!Judge:\nOr-Order! Order in the court! What is this all ab--Payne:Payne:\nTh-This is nonsense! The \"real murderer\"...!?Mia:Mia:\nEven you can't deny that the time between the cable breaking and the electrocution... ...are completely unaccounted for!Payne:Payne:\nTh-Then who was it!? Who else are you saying could've done it!?Mia:\nThere's only one person who could have murdered Mr. Swallow. Only after my client had left the scene... ...was there a window of opportunity for the real killer!Judge:\nMs. Fey. Is the defense ready to indict someone as this \"real killer\"?Mia:\n(It's finally time. This is the moment I've been waiting for.) Yes, Your Honor. We are ready.Judge:\nVery well. But remember! If you accuse the wrong person, you will be penalized. Think very carefully before you speak, Ms. Fey. Now then, Ms. Fey. Let's have it. Who is the \"real killer\"!?Present Dahlia Hawthorne profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"It could only have been you, Dahlia Hawthorne!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nJudge:\n...\nPayne:\n......\nDahlia:\n.........\nJudge:\nWhat's that supposed to be!?\nMia:\nErr... Umm... A bout of youthful indiscretion! ...Your Honor!\nJudge:\nMaybe so, but I still have to penalize you.\nMia:\n(Unngggh... No way! I won't let it end like this!)\nJudge:\nNow this time, I expect you to think a bit more carefully!\nLeads back to:\n\"Now then, Ms. Fey. Let's have it. Who is the \"real killer\"!?\"Mia:\nIt could only have been you, Dahlia Hawthorne!Dahlia:\nWaaaaah! H-How... H-How can you...!Payne:Payne:\nTh-The defense is grasping at straws!Mia:\nTen minutes passed between the time the cable broke and the time of the electrocution! What exactly were you doing that whole time, Ms. Hawthorne? Were you really listening to some music while \"cheering them both on\" as they fought? I find it hard to believe that you didn't lift a finger to stop the men \"dearest\" to you!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Ms. Fey! Wh-What... I mean, why... That is to say...Mia:\nMs. Hawthorne! I believe you did witness the two men fighting on that day. However! After Mr. Wright pushed the victim, and subsequently left the scene... ...it was YOU who pushed Mr. Swallow to his death by your very own hands!Dahlia:\nAAAAAAAAHHH!!! H-How can you say something so mean, Madame Fey...! I... I didn't do anything...!Judge:\nMs. Fey! This is a very serious charge you are--Phoenix:Phoenix:\nYour Honor! P-Please, I have something I want to say! *achoo*Judge:\nY-Y-You! Wh-What is it!?Phoenix:\nPlease... Please strike everything the defense said just now from the record!Mia:\nWhat the...!? Are you daft!?Phoenix:\nYou're totally wrong, Miss Fey! Dollie... She... She couldn't do something like that!Judge:\nMr. Wright!! Get back in your seat! Bailiff! Grab that man!Phoenix:\nAaaarrgghh... *achoo* *achoo* Leave my Dollie alone! *achoo* *cough*???:\n... *sigh* That boy...Grossberg:\nHe's gotten himself in way over his head.Mia:\nOh...! Mr. Grossberg! You're back!Grossberg:\nIt seems I've arrived just in the nick of time. I found the police report on that incident in your newspaper clipping!Police Report added to the Court Record.Mia:\nThank you so much! This is exactly what I was hoping for!Grossberg:\nYou'd better take a good look at it... It... err... details how you came to lose your boyfriend.Judge:\nNow then, the defense has made a very serious accusation. Mr. Payne, what do you have to say about this?Payne:\nW-Well really, Your Honor... I... I... That is I...Dahlia: \nMay I interrupt you for just a moment, Mr. Prosecutor?Payne:\nAh, don't you worry, my dear. I have this situation well in hand.Dahlia:\n... ... *sniffle*Payne:\nErr, that is I... Um... G-G-Go right ahead.Dahlia:\nMadame Fey, are you seriously accusing me of killing my sweet Dougie?Mia:\nYes. I am.

Why did I do that...?That girl... You shouldn't see her anymore.Hey! It's none of your business!I'm telling you for your sake. If you continue to see her, it's going to be bad news.Y-You're lying!Just listen to me. There's something you need to know about that girl... ...Stop it! D-Don't talk about her like that!It-It wasn't me! I-I d-didn't... I didn't do it!-- Five Years Earlier --Mia FeySecond TrialApril 11, 9:40 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3Mia:\n(Whew, it's finally time... I'm kind of nervous...)???:\n*Ah-HHHHEM!*Mia:\nOh! Mr. Grossberg! Good morning!Grossberg:\nAh, Mia. Please calm yourself down! You're going to get yourself arrested for suspicious behavior, you know.Mia:\nWhat are you talking about!! I am relaxed, Mr. Grossberg!! Look at me, I'm relaxed!!Grossberg:\n*Grrrmmphh* L-Let go of my lapels! Hmph... You obviously haven't got the temperament to be a lawyer.Mia:\nI, err... I'm so sorry! It's just that I'm so nervous today...Grossberg:\nOh, that's right. This is your first time in the big leagues, isn't it? Well, never you fear my dear. I, Marvin Grossberg, am at your service!Mia:\nUmm, actually this is my second time in court...Grossberg:\nStill, you surprised me... What, with your earnest request last night... \"Let me handle this case!\" you suddenly said. And quite forcefully, too!Mia:\nI just found out yesterday. About the case, I mean.Grossberg:\nWhat? And you've already learned all the relevant facts?Mia:\nWell about that... You see... I mean, of course I have! I think.Grossberg:\nOh dear... In any case, don't let our client see you're so nervous. You see the poor young man in the pink sweater over there? That's our client.Phoenix:\n*cough* *sniffle* Good morning there everybody!Mia:\nGood morning... (Try to keep smiling, Mia!)Phoenix:\nI, err, I just want to say... I'll give it all I've got! Yup, it'll be fine! No prob! *cough* *achoo* *achoo*Mia:\nOh, what's wrong? Do you have a cold or something... Mr. Wry?Phoenix:\nActually, it's Wright... Like the flying brothers... People screw it up all the time. And yes I have a cold. That's what this mask is for. My doc says this way, I won't give it to anyone else... Be kind to others, he says...Mia:\nRight, Mr. Wright! You have nothing to fear in court today! If you are truly innocent... I promise I will save you!Phoenix:\nNnnnggghh... P-Please l-let go of my shirt... *cough*Mia:\n(That's right, he's the one on trial, not you! He's the one who should be nervous! You need to stay strong for your client, Mia!)Mia:\nMy name is Mia Fey. I'm still pretty new at this lawyer thing... The first time I appeared in court was a year ago. But that trial traumatized me so badly, I thought I'd never set foot in another courtroom. It's been one year since then, and well, here I am again. But this time... This time I'm going to win. (Changed from [But this time... This time I'll win.] in the original release) For my client... And for myself.April 11, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Phoenix Wright.Mia:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor!Payne:\nThe prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Judge:\nThe defense today is... Ms... Ms... Mia Fey, was it?Mia:\nY-Yes, Your Honor. Is there a problem?Judge:\nI was under the impression that Marvin Grossberg was to be leading the defense.Mia:\nYes! Well, you see... Mr. Grossberg had... A-A bit of an emergency...Judge:\nEmergency? But isn't that him standing there right next to you?Mia:\nYes, well...Judge:\nYou... You're just a rookie. Are you sure you can really handle this?Mia:\n(Don't let him scare you, Mia! Give him your toughest look!) Of course, Your Honor! ... I think.Judge:\nHmm... Well, Mr. Payne. Your opening statement, please.Payne:\nWell, well, well... I can't believe a veteran like me has to spend his time baby-sitting a new defense lawyer.Mia:\n...!Payne:\nDon't worry little girl. It will all be over soon.Mia:\n(What was that all about? Was he trying to trash-talk me?)Payne:\nNow then, I'd like to proceed with a summary of events on the day in question. The incident occurred on the campus of Ivy University. The murder victim was a student named Doug Swallow. He was a fourth year student studying Pharmacology.Judge:\nHmm... It sounds like he was a very bright young man.Payne:\nYes, well, next we have a photo taken at the scene of the crime. Students discovered the scene shortly after the murder. They found the victim's body... ...and the defendant, who had obviously bungled his getaway. They then called the police.Judge:\nHmm... That certainly makes the defendant look very suspicious indeed. Very well. The court accepts this photo into the record as evidence.Crime Photo 1 added to the Court Record.Judge:\nBy the way... I can't quite tell the cause of death from this photo.Payne:\nHee, hee, hee... Your reputation for sagacity is well-earned, Your Honor. The truth is that this victim died a rather unusual death.Mia:\nAn unusual death...!?Judge:\nWhat do you mean, Mr. Payne!?Payne:\nWell... Perhaps the defense would like to take this question.Mia:\nHuh...!?Payne:\nA simple question. I thought I might loosen you up a bit. I am a genteel-man, if you will.Mia:\nUm, a what? (Stand up to him, Mia! Show him what you're made of!)Grossberg:\nAh, a perfect opportunity! Well, what was it? The cause! Go on! ... ...Please say you know at least this much.Mia:\nI-I'm so sorry... I-I didn't get a chance to read through the whole file.Grossberg:\n*groan* My hemorrhoids are beginning to act up... Now see here! The details of the case are filed under the Court Record. But you knew that already, didn't you?Mia:\n(Ah! The Court Record! I think I can see that by pressing [the R Button / Tab]...) (Changed from [Ah! The Court Record! I think I can see that by touching the Court Record Button...] in the original release)Grossberg:\nAll of the weapons we need can be found in the Court Record. Take a good, hard look at the data there and think carefully before you answer, m'dear!Mia:\nY-Yes, sir! I'll do just that! (I've got to stay calm! I can't let that prosecutor get the better of me! The Court Record... OK, let's take a look! I just press [the R Button / Tab] here... (Changed from [The Court Record... OK, let's take a look! I just touch the Court Record Button here...] in the original release))Judge:\nNow then, would the attorney for the defense please answer the question? What was the cause of death?Asphyxiation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nWell... I think you'll find it was a case of asphyxiation.\nJudge:\nHmm... Asphyxiation, huh?\nGrossberg:\nM-Mia! What are you doing!? (Changed from [M-Mia! What are you saying!?] in the original release)\nMia:\nWell, it's stuffy in here! I can hardly breathe.\nGrossberg:\nNo one's asking how you feel! Please, make sure to properly read the Court Record!\nMia:\nI-I'm so sorry! I'll take a better look! (Hang in there, Mia! Okay! The Court Record is [the R Button / Tab]...) (Changed from [Hang in there, Mia! Open the Court Record with the Court Record Button...] in the original release)\nJudge:\nHmm... I'll ask you once again.\nLeads back to:\n\"What was the cause of death?\"Electrocution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"According to the Court Record, it was a fatal electric shock. In other words, electrocution.\"Hypothermia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nErr... Hypothermia, I believe.\n... ... ......\nMia:\nUmm, Mr. Grossberg? Does it suddenly feel very cold in here to you?\nGrossberg:\nThat's because your absurd reply has brought a chill to the courtroom!\nMia:\nI-I'm so sorry...\nGrossberg:\nLook at the Court Record more carefully, would you! How can you expect to win a case this way!?\nMia:\n(Hang in there, Mia! Okay! The Court Record is [the R Button / Tab]...) (Changed from [Hang in there, Mia! Open the Court Record with the Court Record Button...] in the original release)\nJudge:\nHmm... I'll ask you once again.\nLeads back to:\n\"What was the cause of death?\"Mia:\nAccording to the Court Record, it was a fatal electric shock. In other words, electrocution.Judge:\nElectrocution? Hmm... But how could such a thing happen? Did the murderer use some type of new, super-powerful stun-gun, perhaps?Payne:\nThe answer to that will become crystal clear as this trial proceeds, Your Honor. But before that, there is one more vital issue.Mia:\nWh-What's that?Payne:\nWhy, motive of course. Apparently there was some bad blood between the victim and the defendant.Judge:\nBad blood...?Mia:\nWh-What do you mean...?Payne:\nOopsie! I'm terribly sorry. You're the defense attorney, so you must know all about it. I shouldn't be stealing your spotlight like this.Mia:\n(I really don't like this guy's smug attitude...)Grossberg:\nThat's Winston Payne for you. He is one smooth operator, if you catch my drift. They don't call him the \"Rookie Killer\" for nothing, you know.Judge:\nNow then, let's hear from the defense. What was the source of the bad blood between the victim and the defendant? And this time, I would like to see some supporting evidence!Mia:\nEv-Evidence...?Grossberg:\nAh, no need to get all worked up over this. As I said, all our weapons can be found in the Court Record. Find the evidence you need and then shove it into Ol' Graybeard's face!Mia:\nY-Yes, sir! Into Ol' Graybeard's face!Judge:\nErr, Mr. Grossberg. Try to set a better example for the young lady!Grossberg:\nMia, evidence isn't the only thing in the Court Record. People's profiles are as well. You can toggle between Profiles and Evidence with [the R Button / Tab], so be sure to go over it all! (Changed from [You can toggle between Profiles and Evidence, so be sure to go over it all!] in the original release)Judge:\nNow then, let's see what you've got. What was the cause of the bad blood between Phoenix Wright and the victim?Present Dahlia Hawthorne profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The reason for the bad blood between the two of them was... this woman here.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nJudge:\nMr. Grossberg... I honestly think it would be best for the defense if you were in charge. I'm afraid Ms. Fey might stir up some bad blood with this court if she were to continue.\nGrossberg:\nOr simply put, you are quite mistaken, m'dear.\nMia:\nOh no... I'm so sorry...\nJudge:\nEven if you are new, your lack of preparation is inexcusable. Now take a moment and think it over again.\nMia:\nY-Yes, Your Honor! (It's OK! You've got another chance, Mia!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Mia, evidence isn't the only thing in the Court Record.\"Mia:\nThe reason for the bad blood between the two of them was... this woman here.Judge:\nDahlia Hawthorne, is it?Payne:\nVery good, Ms. Fey. You seem to have picked up on at least this much. This woman is the girlfriend of the defendant, Phoenix Wright. But up until about eight months ago, she was with the victim, Mr. Swallow. Clearly she has some part to play in this story.Judge:\nHmm...Grossberg:\nAh, he's done it again. Before the cross-examination starts, he's already got the judge thinking like he wants.Judge:\nVery well, Mr. Payne. Please call your first witness!Payne:\nIf it pleases the court, the prosecution would like to call Mr. Phoenix Wright.Judge:\nWhat? The defendant himself? Well, Ms. Fey?Mia:\n(It's fine! After all, Mr. Wright is innocent, right?) The defense has no objection.Judge:\nVery well. The court calls Mr. Phoenix Wright to the witness stand!Payne:\nWitness, please state your name and occupation.Phoenix:\nOh, ah, yes... My name is Phoenix Wright. My job is, um... Well, right now, I guess I'm a suspect.Judge:\nNo, no. He means what did you do before you were arrested?Phoenix:\nOh... *achoo* *achoo* *achoo* I was a university student.Payne:\nMr. Wright. You understand that you are suspected in the death of your fellow student, Doug Swa--Phoenix:\nBut! But I didn't do it! I'm innocent I tell you! I'm telling you I was... *achoo* *achoo* *cough* *cough* *achoo* *cough*Judge:\nWould the defendant please refrain from passing on his cold to the rest of us!Payne:\nIt seems the witness has something he wants to say.Judge:\nHmm... Well then, Mr. Wright. Please tell us about your relation to the victim.Phoenix:\nRight away, Your Honor!Witness Testimony-- The Victim and I --Phoenix:\nUm, I... I admit I was there...\nBut I'm not a killer! All I did was find his body!\nI hardly knew the guy to begin with...\nI never even talked to that stuck-up British wannabe!Judge:\nHmm... I see. So you hardly knew the victim?Phoenix:\nRight! Like I said, I'm not a killer!Mia:\nWhew... It looks like the judge understands.Grossberg:\nMmfph... You're being na\u00efve, you know. Too na\u00efve.Mia:\nHuh...?Payne:\nHee, hee, hee, hee, hee. It seems that you've forgotten one small thing, young lady.Mia:\nAnd that would be...?Payne:\nThis witness still has to undergo something called cross-examination.Mia:\nCross-examination...?Grossberg:\nHe's right. And it's the defense's duty to carry out the cross-examination. The purpose is to determine if a witness's testimony contains any contradictions.Mia:\nContradictions...?Grossberg:\nIf a witness is lying, their statements will conflict with the Court Record.Mia:\nBut... Mr. Wright is my client!Grossberg:\nEven if he is your client, in court, all lies must be struck down. As a lawyer, that is your duty, you see.Mia:\n(What does he mean by that? Is he saying that testimony just now... That there was a lie -- a contradiction?)Judge:\nNow then, your cross-examination, if you please, Ms. Fey.Mia:\n(Please, Mr. Wright... Tell me you haven't been lying! You wouldn't do that to me... would you...?)Cross Examination-- The Victim and I --Phoenix:\nUm, I... I admit I was there...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nWhen you say \"there\", you mean the place where the victim was murdered?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yeah, sort of. The place where SOMETHING happened anyway.\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\n\"Something\"? You can't hide what happened. We have photographic evidence.\nPhoenix:\n*achoo* *achoo* *achoo* *achoo*\nMia:\nA-Anyway, Mr. Wright... What were you doing at the scene of the crime? I thought you said you didn't know the victim, Mr. Swallow.\nPhoenix:\nIt was just a coincidence! We bumped into each other by accident.\nJudge:\nA coincidence, huh...?Phoenix:\nBut I'm not a killer! All I did was find his body!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nYou say you found the body? So who called the police?\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? Um... *achoo* *cough* *achoo* *cough* *achoo* *cough*\nPayne:\nUnfortunately it was some other students that notified the police.\nJudge:\n\"Other students\"...?\nPayne:\nThat's correct. They were witnesses. Witnesses who saw the defendant standing there, next to the body, in shock!\nJudge:\nW-What! Is this true, Mr. Wright!?\nPhoenix:\n*achoo* *achoo* *achoo* *achoo* *achoo* *achoo*\nMia:\n(Could you stop sneezing every time you're in a bind...?)\nPhoenix:\nW-Well, it's true that I was pretty shocked when I found the body. But, but I...Phoenix:\nI hardly knew the guy to begin with...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nSo, you didn't know his face, or even his name, right?\nPhoenix:\nRight! Um, well, no... That is... I mean...\nMia:\nSo... Which is it? Did you know him or not?\nPhoenix:\n*achoo* *achoo* *achoo*\nJudge:\nNow, see here! You can't avoid answering the question by sneezing all day!\nPhoenix:\nErr... Umm, well... I guess I did know his name.\nMia:\n(N-News to me! Why didn't he tell me that before...?)\nPhoenix:\nUm... I heard he used to date Dollie.\nJudge:\nWho is this \"Dollie\" person?\nPayne:\nAh yes, that would be the defendant's lover, Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne.\nJudge:\nOh, I see. Ah, young love... So bittersweet...\nPhoenix:\nBut that's all I knew about him!Phoenix:\nI never even talked to that stuck-up British wannabe!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nMr. Wright, you stated the following in your testimony: \"I hardly knew the guy to begin with...\"\nPhoenix:\nTh-That's right! I mean why would I even--\nMia:\nBut that doesn't sound right. If you hardly knew him... ...then why would you say that the victim was a \"stuck-up British wannabe\"!?\nPhoenix:\n...\nMia:\n...\nPhoenix:\n... *achoo*\nMia:\nWell, Mr. Wright!?\nPhoenix:\nAh! No! It wasn't me! I'm not a killer, I swear!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. I will give you an opportunity to revise your testimony. How is it that you knew the victim was, as you put it, a \"British wannabe\"...?\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, well...\nAdds statement \"He was always walking around with a huge Union Jack on the back of his shirt.\"Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nMr. Wright, you stated the following in your testimony: \"I hardly knew the guy to begin with...\"\nPhoenix:\nTh-That's right! I mean why would I even--\nMia:\nBut that doesn't sound right. If you hardly knew him... ...then why would you say that the victim was a \"stuck-up British wannabe\"!?\nPhoenix:\nUm, well, you see...Phoenix:\nHe was always walking around with a huge Union Jack on the back of his shirt.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nDid you see it at the crime scene? The Union Jack, I mean.\nPhoenix:\nY-Yes, that's right! I saw it at the crime scene! That's why... That's why I figured he must love British stuff, see? It's true! Cross my heart! I swear I didn't do it...\nMia:\n(He's acting fishier than the salmon I ate last night...)\nJudge:\nMay I ask you something, Ms. Fey?\nMia:\nY-Yes, Your Honor. (What is it now?)\nJudge:\nWho is this person anyway? This \"Union Jack\" fellow...\nMia:\n...\nPayne:\nThe Union Jack is the name of the flag of England.\nJudge:\nOh, I see... So you mean like the \"Stars and Stripes\", right?\nPayne:\nAs usual, Your Honor, your insight astounds me.\nMia:\n(Hey, something just occurred to me... Isn't there something strange about this bit just now?)\nGrossberg:\nMia... There is a contradiction here!\nMia:\nM-Mr. Grossberg!\nGrossberg:\nQuickly now! Show that boy you mean business! With evidence, I mean!\nMia:\n(OK, Mia, check the Court Record carefully!)Present Crime Photo 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Are you certain you saw the \"Union Jack\"?\"Grossberg:\nWell m'dear, do you think you can manage on your own from this point?I can handle it myself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n(One year ago... I was in a courtroom just like this. I can do it. I can handle this myself!)\nGrossberg:\nMmrgh... You mustn't try to bite off more than you can chew, Mia.\nMia:\nI-I'll be fine! I know what I have to do!\nGrossberg:\nRemember, you can always press him to get more information. Oh, and one more thing. When you're going to state a contradiction, make sure you present some definitive proof.\nMia:\n(OK, Mia. One more time, from the very beginning of his testimony!)I need some help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nUmm, Mr. Grossberg... I could use a little help...\nGrossberg:\nAh, please don't look so sad. It brings a tear to my eye when you do. Alright, listen carefully. By comparing the testimony to the Court Record... ...you should be able to discover any contradictions, if there are any. And when you've found one...\nMia:\nI present the piece of evidence that contradicts the witness's testimony...?\nGrossberg:\nYes. That's the ticket!\nMia:\nBut still... I don't see any contradictions in Mr. Wright's testimony!\nGrossberg:\nHmm... Maybe you don't have enough information yet.\nMia:\nInformation...?\nGrossberg:\nYou can press for more information by leaning on a witness.\nMia:\nEven if they're my own client?\nGrossberg:\nIt doesn't matter who it is, if you think they're lying, press them like a cheap suit! That is the obligation of an attorney.\nMia:\n(OK, Mia. One more time, from the very beginning of his testimony!)Mia:\nAre you certain you saw the \"Union Jack\"?Phoenix:\nY-Yeah, I'm sure. It was right there on his back.Judge:\nMs. Fey, is there some point to this line of questioning?Mia:\nYour Honor, please take another look at the crime scene photo. As you can see, there's absolutely nothing written on the victim's back.Phoenix:\nHey! Wait a minute! He's wearing a leather jacket! The Union Jack was on the back of the t-shirt he was wearing...Mia:\nI was under the impression that you accidentally came across the body. But, if that was really the case, then you wouldn't know that, would you? You'd have no idea at all what he was wearing underneath that jacket! Mr. Wright... You've been lying to me!Phoenix:\n... P-P-P-Please forgive me! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!Grossberg:\nMia! You've made our client cry!Mia:\nLet him! That \"P\" on his chest doesn't stand for \"Phoenix\" anyways! I can't believe I trusted him! Mr. Wright was all wrong!Payne:\nHee, hee, hee, hee. That was an impressive bit of cross-examination.Mia:\n...!Payne:\nThank you for uncovering the defendant's lies for me. It's quite clear that this man did not simply \"stumble upon\" the scene of the crime!Phoenix:\nUggghhh...Mia:\n(Uh oh... Did I go too far?)Payne:\nBy the way, Mr. Wright. You seem to have a rather bad cold. Have you taken any medicine for it?Phoenix:\nI, err, umm... Yeah, I took some but...Payne:\nWas the medicine that you took an over-the-counter brand called \"Coldkiller X\"?Phoenix:\nYeah, that's right! It kills colds good! Hey, wait a second... How did you know I'm a big fan of Coldkiller X...?Payne:\nHee, hee, hee, hee... Would you happen to have that medicine with you right now?Phoenix:\nWell... Actually, I seem to have lost it somewhere...Mia:\n(He lost it? Does this even have anything to do with the case...?)Payne:\nMr. Wright... Shall I tell you where your cold medicine is right now?Phoenix:\nHuh...?Payne:\nYour Honor! I'd like you to take a look at another photo from the crime scene!Judge:\nWh-What's this! In the victim's hand, it's... It's Coldkiller X...!Mia:Mia:\nY-Yes, but even I've got a bottle of Coldkiller X in my apartment!Payne:Payne:\nI'm sorry, but I'm afraid that argument won't work. There's no doubt as to who this bottle of Coldkiller X belonged to. Especially since Mr. Wright's fingerprints were all over it!Mia:\nWh-What!?Payne:\nSensing his murderous intent, Mr. Swallow must have picked up the bottle of medicine... ...dropped by Mr. Wright and hid it in his hand. His purpose in doing so can only have been to identify his killer as Phoenix Wright!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court!Payne:\nYour Honor! I'd like to present this photo and bottle as evidence!Judge:\nVery well. The court will accept them into the record.Crime Photo 2 added to the Court Record.Coldkiller X added to the Court Record.Payne:\nAlso, the victim's wristwatch was broken.Judge:\nBroken...?Payne:\nYes, it ceased functioning when a large wave of electricity passed through it. Well, Mr. Wright! Do you have some kind of explanation for all of this!?Phoenix:\nUggghhh...Mia:\n(This is really bad...)Grossberg:\nOh, my buttocks... My poor, poor hemorrhoids...Witness Testimony-- What Really Happened --Phoenix:\nThe truth is... I went because he called me.\nHe was in the Pharmacology Dept., so we agreed to meet at 2:45 behind that building...\nWe talked for a bit, and then at around 3:00, we split up.\nThen later when I went back, I found him lying there.\nI'd been taking Coldkiller X for the last 2 or 3 days...\nBut I lost my bottle of it around lunchtime on the day of the accident.Judge:\nMr. Wright! That's completely different than the testimony you gave previously!Phoenix:\n*achoo* *achoo* *achoo* I-I'm sorry, Your Honor! I was afraid you wouldn't believe the truth!Payne:\nYou'll forgive me if I say I hardly find your current testimony any more credible.Judge:\nHmm... Ms. Fey, please begin your cross-examination.Mia:\n(Oh please, Mr. Wright... Don't tell any more lies.)Cross Examination-- What Really Happened --Phoenix:\nThe truth is... I went because he called me.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nHad you ever met the victim before then?\nPhoenix:\nNo! Never! ... But... That day, he called me up and told me he wanted to talk about Dollie.\nJudge:\nAnd this \"Dollie\" person is...?\nPhoenix:\nMy um... It's kind of embarrassing. She's my, umm, sweetheart...\nGrossberg:\nOomph...! Wh-What... What was that for, Mia!?\nMia:\nOh! I'm so sorry! I just felt like slapping something all of a sudden!\nPayne:\nDahlia Hawthorne was also the lover of the murder victim, Doug Swallow. ...Before she met Mr. Wright, that is.\nJudge:\nHmm... So it was one of those nasty love triangles, I see...Phoenix:\nHe was in the Pharmacology Dept., so we agreed to meet at 2:45 behind that building...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nWas it Mr. Swallow who indicated you should meet at 2:45?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. And we were both there right on time.\nJudge:\nHmm... You said the victim was in the Pharmacology Dept., correct?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, he was studying how to manufacture and improve pharmaceuticals. Everyone called him the \"Alchemist of Ivy U\".\nJudge:\nAn \"alchemist\"... I see...\nPhoenix:\nI gotta admit it was a little suspicious. He had a whole laboratory and everything! It was filled with chemicals and strange machines that run on high-voltage electricity.\nJudge:\nHo ho. How fascinating. He sounds like he was quite an ambitious young man.\nMia:\n(What do I do!? Maybe I should ask him for some more details?)\n\n\n\nAbout timing of the meeting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nSo you are absolutely certain that you met at 2:45?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, pretty sure. That's the time class ends. But they're always doing experiments, so it doesn't matter much.\nMia:\nExperiments...?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. Those pharmacology guys are always in the lab whipping up something.\nMia:\n(Well, it looks like he's right about the time anyway.)\nPayne:\nWitness, let's go on with your testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nAbout Pharmacology Dept.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nI was wondering if you could tell us a bit more about the Pharmacology Department.\nPhoenix:\nWell OK, sure. I don't know all that much though.\nMia:\nA little bit earlier in your testimony, you said something interesting. You said the department uses strange machines that run on high-voltage electricity.\nPhoenix:\nThat's right. And they sure look dangerous. They use non-standard voltages, so there are high-voltage cables everywhere.\nMia:\n\"High-voltage cables\"...\nPhoenix:\nYeah, there were electrical poles set up all around the building. The high-voltage cables run overhead around the roof.\nMia:\n(Finally I think we're getting somewhere...!)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nForget about it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n(I've gotten everything I need from this statement. It's time to move on.)\nPayne:\nIn any case, let's continue with your testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examinationPhoenix:\nWe talked for a bit, and then at around 3:00, we split up.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nSo what was it you were talking about?\nPhoenix:\nYou know... *achoo* *cough* That maybe we should hang out again sometime.\nMia:\n(\"Hang out again sometime\"? I wish that were true.)Phoenix:\nThen later when I went back, I found him lying there.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nSo you say you went back...\nPhoenix:\nUmm, yeah. That's when I found the body.\nMia:\nYes, but why did you go back in the first place? Weren't you angry with him?\nPhoenix:\nWell, th-that's right, I was. ...\nMia:\nThen why, Mr. Wright? Why did you go back there?\nPhoenix:\n... Umm... I thought maybe we could make up.\nMia:\n...\nPayne:\n...\nJudge:\n...\nPhoenix:\n... *achoo* *achoo*\nMia:\n(Judging by the atmosphere... I'm pretty sure no one is buying this.)Phoenix:\nI'd been taking Coldkiller X for the last 2 or 3 days...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nIt's rather unusual to catch a cold this time of the year, isn't it?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, I always get a little careless when the weather starts to warm up. I guess I shouldn't sleep with the window open this early in spring, huh?\nMia:\n(I suppose common sense is not always common...) So... Did anyone else know that you were taking cold medicine?\nPhoenix:\nWell, I always took one after meals... So I'm pretty sure all my friends knew about it.Phoenix:\nBut I lost my bottle of it around lunchtime on the day of the accident.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nOn the day of the incident, what did you do for lunch...?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? What does that have to do with anything?\nMia:\nYou can never be too sure...\nPhoenix:\nI always eat with Dollie... Just the two of us. Dollie's homemade lunches are just the greatest! Mmm! Her mini-omelettes are magically delicious! Eheh heh heh.\nGrossberg:\nYeowch!! Wh-Why did you punch me in the jaw!?\nMia:\nOh! I-I'm so sorry...! I just felt like hurting someone all of a sudden!Grossberg:\nWell, Mia?Mia:\nI don't know... I can't seem to find any contradictions.Grossberg:\nThe boy isn't exactly what I'd call a natural-born liar, you know. But still, we can't have him continue to spout nonsense.Mia:\nI know... But what can I do!?Grossberg:\nWell, I'm certain he must still be hiding something. Information! Right now it's information we need more than anything else!After pressing sixth statement and selecting \"About Pharmacology Dept.\" upon pressing second statement:Judge:\nI think that's enough for now. So the defendant and the victim met at approximately the time of his death. And then the defendant returned to the scene for some unknown reason.Payne:\nI'm not entirely convinced by his explanation about the medicine bottle either.Judge:\nLet me be frank here, Mr. Wright. Your testimony cannot be trusted.Phoenix:\nWh-What do you mean!?Payne:\nHee, hee, hee, hee... I knew it was too much work for a little girl.Mia:\nHmph...!Judge:\nHowever, there is one mystery that still remains.Payne:\nThere is, Your Honor?Judge:\nHow the murder was carried out, of course. Just how was the victim electrocuted? I don't believe the murder weapon has been produced yet, correct?Payne:\nWell, that is... I... You are correct, Your Honor.Mia:\n(So how exactly was Mr. Swallow killed...? If I could somehow establish how it was done... Maybe I could still come out of this mess smelling like a rose!)Establish murder method\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor!\"Can't right now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n(Hmm, I do have one idea, but it would be impossible to prove it.)\nGrossberg:\nMia, m'dear. If you have any ideas, now is the time to present them.\nMia:\nMr. Grossberg!\nGrossberg:\nRemember, silence is NOT golden. ...In court, anyway.\nMia:\n(Silence is not golden, huh? Well in that case...)\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor!\"Mia:\nYour Honor!Judge:\nY-Yes, Ms. Fey?Mia:\nI believe that if we were to piece together everything we've heard up until now... ...we should be able to solve the mystery of how Mr. Swallow died.Judge:\nTh-That would be most impressive!Payne:\nHee, hee, hee, hee... Quite the brash statement coming from a rookie! But even a beginner like you must understand the basic rules of the court, yes? An attorney must be able to substantiate their arguments with evidence!Mia:\nHmph! Of course I know that! (Actually, I had totally forgotten about that...)Judge:\nNow then, Ms. Fey. Let me see what you've got. Show me how you believe the victim was electrocuted!Present Crime Photo 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"As for the cause of death...\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nJudge:\nMs. Fey, I'm deeply disappointed in you.\nPayne:\nI'm disappointed as well, Ms. Fey.\nGrossberg:\nTo be honest, I'm a bit disappointed too, Mia.\nPhoenix:\n... *achoo*\nMia:\n(Argh!

You can't strike out here!)\nLeads back to:\n\"Ms. Fey, where exactly in this photo is the murder weapon?\"Mia:\nWell, naturally... it's right here!Judge:\nThat's... That's... What is that?Mia:\nA severed electrical cable, I believe... Your Honor. Remember the testimony we've heard. The machines the pharmacology students use in their experiments require high voltage... ...and because of that, there are special high-voltage cables strung up everywhere!Judge:\nSo then, the high-voltage cable...!Mia:\nYes, the high-voltage cable is the cause of death. That is the most likely explanation!Judge:\nHmm... That certainly sounds plausible. Well, Mr. Payne? What do you have to say about this?Payne:\nWell... I believe some praise is in order.Mia:\nDon't toy with me, old man!Payne:\nNow, now. The victim's cause of death may indeed have been a high-voltage cable. However! I want you to think about what that really implies! The only one who had the opportunity to use the cable as a murder weapon was... The defendant!Phoenix:\n... *achoo*Judge:\nHmm... That much is certainly true.Payne:\nYes, and that's not all. We have proof. Irrefutable proof that will establish that Mr. Wright was the murderer.Judge:\nY-You do!? Well, what is it!?Payne:\nHis fingerprints.Judge:\nFingerprints...? You mean that the defendant's fingerprints were on something besides the medicine bottle?Payne:\nLet's take another look at the crime scene photo. As you can see, the victim is wearing a leather jacket. And as you may know, leather holds fingerprints quite well.Mia:\nAh! Y-You mean...?Payne:\nYes. It was quite clearly imprinted on the chest area of the victim's jacket. The palm print of the defendant's very own hand!Judge:\nWh-Whaaat!?Payne:\nI can only think of one way Mr. Wright could have left a print like that. Intent on murder, he squarely pushed the victim towards the severed electrical cable!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! That's enough! I think we can conclude that there is no reason to continue with this cross-examination.Grossberg:\nStick a fork in us, we're done.Mia:\nM-Mr. Grossberg!Grossberg:\nMy hemorrhoids never lie. The show is over, Mia. I knew that boy was guilty the first time I saw him.Mia:\nN-No! You're wrong! Mr. Wright is innocent.Judge:\nNo further evidence is required to convince me of this man's guilt!Mia:\nY-Your Honor...!Judge:\nAt this time, I am prepared to render a verdict in this case!Mia:Judge:\nDo you have something further to add, Ms. Fey?Mia:\nIs this what you want, Mr. Wright!?Phoenix:\n...!Mia:\nYou still haven't told us the truth... the whole truth. If you don't say something now, the judge is going to hand down his verdict!Phoenix:\nB-But I... I can't! I-I just can't say it! If I told you what really happened, then I'd b-be...Mia:\nIt's OK, Mr. Wright. I'm your attorney. You can trust me.Phoenix:\nM-Miss Fey...Mia:\nNo matter what it is you have to say... I believe in you and I'll represent you to the very end.Phoenix:\n...!Payne:Payne:\nWe've already established the defendant's guilt. There's no further need for him to say anything.Phoenix:\n*cough* *cough* W-Wait a minute!Mia:\nMr. Wright...Phoenix:\nI... I'll tell you what really happened!Payne:Payne:\nBut I've already told you, Mr. Wright. There's no need for further...Phoenix:\n*cough* I-I-I... I did it... I admit it! I pushed him! It's my fault... My f-fault that D-Doug Swallow is dead!That girl... You shouldn't see her anymore.Hey! It's none of your business!I'm telling you for your sake. If you continue to see her, it's going to be bad news.Y-You're lying!Just listen to me. There's something you need to know about that girl......Stop it! D-Don't talk about her like that!Judge:\n... What you just said... Was that the truth!?Phoenix:\nY-Yes, I... I was afraid... Afraid that if I told the truth... ...everyone would think I was the murderer for sure!Judge:\nWell, as things currently stand, we're all absolutely convinced you are!Phoenix:\nP-Please...! Please give me one more chance to explain! This time I swear... I swear I'll tell the whole truth! It'll be OK, won't it, Miss Fey? I... I believe in you!Mia:\nOh! Um, th-thank you. (I still can't believe it... He really did push the victim...)Grossberg:\nUnnngh... It feels like my hemorrhoids are doing the Harlem Shake!Witness Testimony-- When I Pushed The Victim --Phoenix:\nThat guy... He was talking bad about Dollie...\nI lost my temper and gave him a shove!\nAt that moment, I heard some kind of loud noise...\nA little while after I left, I started to get worried.\nSo I went back. But h-he was just lying there, d-dead!Payne:\nWell, the explanation is really quite simple. When you pushed him, Mr. Swallow flew back and touched the electrical cable. He died from the shock. And that, as they say, is that.Judge:\nHmm... A simple explanation indeed.Payne:\nAt the time of the incident, a light rain had been falling. Wet from the rain, the victim was more easily electrocuted.Phoenix:\nB-But! When I pushed him, there weren't any electrical cables nearby! If there had been something like that, even I would've noticed it!Mia:\n(That's true... Even a dufus like him couldn't miss that!)Judge:\nHmm... Ms. Fey. Let me warn you right now that if your cross-examination doesn't yield any new facts... ...I intend to deliver my verdict without further delay. Are we clear on that?Mia:\nY-Yes, Your Honor. (Don't give up, Mia! If he is innocent, there must be some kind of evidence somewhere that will prove it!)Cross Examination-- When I Pushed The Victim --Phoenix:\nThat guy... He was talking bad about Dollie...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nSo what kinds of things did Mr. Swallow say to you?\nPhoenix:\nHe said all sorts of terrible things about Dollie! He said that she was a bad girl!\nPayne:\n...\nMia:\n...\nJudge:\n... Umm... Is that all?\nPhoenix:\nYup!\nJudge:\nWell, Ms. Fey, you heard him yourself.\nMia:\n(Oh boy! You're not doing yourself any favors here, Mr. Wright! Please don't make this harder for me than it already is!)\nPhoenix:\nAnyway... After he said that, I just, I just...Phoenix:\nI lost my temper and gave him a shove!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nCan you tell me about what happened in a little more detail?\nPhoenix:\nThat guy... He just said what he wanted to say to me... And then he put on the jacket he was holding and started to leave. That's when... That's when I lost my temper and flew into a furious frenzy! I just gave him a... light, gentle shove to the chest.\nMia:\nAnd when you did that, there was no severed cable anywhere to be seen?\nPhoenix:\nRight! There was nothing like that at all!\nPayne:\nBut is it possible that you merely overlooked it?\nPhoenix:\n... Well, I guess it's possible.\nMia:\n(What are you doing!? Don't let that guy steamroll over you like cheap asphalt!)\nJudge:\nI believe what's important here is the moment the push occurred. Let's continue on with the testimony, witness.Phoenix:\nAt that moment, I heard some kind of loud noise...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nA \"loud noise\"? And what would you say that loud noise was, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nI'm not sure... But it was really loud! It was like, \"SNAP!\"... You know, come to think of it, I wonder what that was...\nPayne:\nHee, hee, hee, hee... Clearly, Your Honor, it was the sound of the victim being electrocuted.\nMia:\n\nMia:\nY-You're not qualified to decide that! (What should I do? I'm treading on some dangerous ground here...)\n\n\n\nAsk for more details\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nMr. Wright, that \"loud noise\" you heard may be extremely important. So try to remember what it was!\nPhoenix:\nUmm, how do I put it... It was like a sharp crack. Aha! Could it... Could it have been...?\nMia:\nYes? Could it have been? Hurry up and tell us!\nPhoenix:\nWhen I pushed him, he dropped the umbrella he was holding. He fell right on top of it, and it broke. That was probably the noise I heard.\nJudge:\nAn umbrella, huh? And did that umbrella belong to the victim?\nPhoenix:\nYeah, it was a plastic umbrella. Cheap and frail, kind of like the owner! Then again, I wish I had any kind of umbrella. I was totally soaked to the bone.\nJudge:\nHmm... Ms. Fey. What do you think? Is there something important in that testimony just now?\nMia:\nUmm, well...\n\n\n\nOf course it's important!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n(This is it, Mia! The new information you've been waiting for!) Of course it's important! No! This cheap umbrella is more than important; it's vital! I want to officially have it entered into the testimony!\nPayne:\nHa! How perfectly fitting. Flimsy information for a flimsy lawyer!\nJudge:\nThe court agrees to the defense's request. Witness, please add the bit about the cheap umbrella to your testimony.\nChanges statement from \"At that moment, I heard some kind of loud noise...\" to \"After I shoved him, he... He fell down on top of his cheap umbrella.\"\n\n\n\n\nOf course it's not important!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nOf course it's not important!\nJudge:\nM-Ms. Fey! How can you state that so proudly!?\nMia:\nWell, it just isn't! It's not important one bit! Not even one iota. OK?\nGrossberg:\nMia! That's enough! You're making a fool of yourself!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... Is it OK if I go on?\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nLeave it alone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n(I've got other, more pressing things to ask about.) Very well, Mr. Wright, let's move on, shall we?\nLeads back to cross-examinationPhoenix:\nAfter I shoved him, he... He fell down on top of his cheap umbrella.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nSo Mr. Swallow fell on top of his umbrella? And you are certain of this?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. It was right there under him. Actually, if it hadn't been under him, I was planning on borrowing it for myself.\nMia:\nThe umbrella, you mean?\nPhoenix:\nWell yeah, you see I was wearing this sweater here... Dollie stayed up late for nights at a time knitting it for me... I didn't want the rain to dampen the handmade symbol of her love...\nGrossberg:\nOomph! My stomach is not to be used as your personal soccer ball, Mia!\nMia:\nAh! I-I'm so sorry!\nJudge:\nContinue on with your testimony, witness.Present Crime Photo 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Why didn't you testify about the umbrella from the very beginning?\"Phoenix:\nA little while after I left, I started to get worried.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nAfter you shoved the victim, did you leave the scene right away?\nPhoenix:\nYes, I did! I admit it! I-I was furious!\nPayne:\nYou left without even checking Mr. Swallow's condition?\nPhoenix:\nWell, um, yeah... But like I said, I got worried about him later.Phoenix:\nSo I went back. But h-he was just lying there, d-dead!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nAt that time, did you see anyone else at the scene of the crime?\nPhoenix:\n*cough* *cough*... *cough* *cough* *cough* Um, nope. Nobody...\nMia:\n(Geez. Could that stupid cough possibly sound any phonier?)\nJudge:\nHmm... In that case, it's very hard to believe someone else could have been the murderer...Grossberg:\nUnless we can find something that shows his innocence from that testimony, m'dear... I'm afraid the judge will make his final decision with no remorse whatsoever!Mia:\nY-Yes, sir! (Right now I need more info; info that will help me turn up some contradictions!)Mia:\nWhy didn't you testify about the umbrella from the very beginning?Phoenix:\nCome on... If I had mentioned that...Mia:\nI would've been able to counter the prosecution's arguments earlier!Payne:\nWh-What do you mean by that?Mia:\nTake another look at the crime scene photo! According to Mr. Wright, the victim fell on top of his umbrella. However, if you look closely... ...the umbrella is nowhere near the victim. Actually, it's by the electrical pole!Judge:\nY-You're absolutely right!Mia:\nThe conclusion here is obvious. After the defendant left, the victim moved from where he fell. In other words... After he was pushed by the defendant, Mr. Swallow was still alive!Payne:\nNnnnooooo!!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! The victim... He moved...!? Mr. Payne! The umbrella in this photo... Where is it now?Payne:\nW-Well, it was collected by the police at the crime scene...Judge:\nI want it presented as evidence immediately!Umbrella added to the Court Record.Payne:\nB-But the umbrella could have simply been blown there by the wind!Mia:Mia:\nAccording to the testimony, the victim fell on top of the umbrella. There's simply no way it could have been blown there by the wind!Payne:\nNnn... Gggg... Hrrmph! B-B-But...!Judge:\nI know this matter of the umbrella seems relatively trivial... But as long as the smallest doubt remains, I cannot render final judgment!Payne:\nN-N-N... Noooooooooooooooooooooo!!!Judge:\nI must say, I still find it hard to believe... (Changed from [However, I still find it hard to believe that a huge hole has been blown in the...] in the original release) that a huge hole has been blown in the prosecution's case by the defendant's testimony. (Changed from [...prosecution's case by the defendant's testimony.] in the original release)Phoenix's Testimony added to the Court Record.Grossberg:\nWell done, Mia!Payne:\n......Hee hee. Hee hee hee hee hee...Judge:\nMr. Payne! What are you chuckling about?Payne:\nPardon me, Your Honor. It seems I was expecting too much of a free ride. It was foolish to think I could establish guilt through cross-examination alone.Judge:\nI'm afraid I don't follow what you're saying!Mia:\n... Let me guess. You have another witness.Payne:\nExactly! And this witness's testimony will be incontrovertible!Judge:\nWell!? Who is this witness!?Payne:\nMs. Dahlia Hawthorne.Judge:\nDahlia Hawthorne? You don't mean... \"Dollie\"?Payne:\nI do, Your Honor. The defendant's very own lover is a witness to the whole thing! That's right. She was at the scene of the crime when the murder took place!Judge:\nWhaaaat!?Payne:\nI'm sorry to break the bad news to you, my dear.Mia:\n... \"Bad news\"? You couldn't be more wrong. Actually... I've been waiting for this.Payne:\nYou can't be serious...Grossberg:\nMia! What do you mean by that...?Judge:\nI think this is a good point for us to stop at. Court will now enter a 20 minute recess. Afterwards, we will listen to the testimony of Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne.April 11, 11:52 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3Phoenix:\nMiss Fey... I-I'm sorry about what happened back there... I... I...Mia:\nIt's alright. At least you told us the truth in the end, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nYeah... So I guess I can start to relax then, huh?Grossberg:\nRelax, my boy? You can't be serious! After hiding such important facts...Phoenix:\nB-But...! But the next witness is my Dollie, right? She'll save me! I just know she will!Mia:\nWhy do you think that?Phoenix:\nHuh!? What do you mean!? She... She's the love of my life, that's why!Mia:\nThe love of your life, huh... Would you mind telling me more about you and... Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne?Phoenix:\nSure! No problem! Dollie and I... We first met about eight months ago right here in this very courthouse. Actually, I'm studying to be a lawyer, on the side... Anyway! One day, she and I just bumped into each other in the reading room downstairs. That's why I really think it was fate that brought us together. As soon as I first set eyes on her, I knew she was the one for me. Oh, here! Take a look at this!Mia:\n...!Phoenix:\nShe gave this to me the day we met as a symbol of our love! She had been wearing it around her neck that day, but then... ...she took it off, but before she gave it to me she said, \"I want you to carry this.\"Grossberg:\nSo she gave it to you as a present, I see.Phoenix:\nThis darling little bottle is filled with memories of my darling little Dollie!Mia:\nIt certainly is a little bottle alright.Phoenix:\nIt makes me so happy, I show it to everyone I meet! I want to share my happiness with the whole world!Dahlia's Present borrowed from Phoenix Wright.Mia:\nUm, anyway... So after that, you and Ms. Hawthorne started dating?Phoenix:\nYeah, but she's so shy. Every time I see her, she always says the same thing to me. \"Please give it back now.\"Grossberg:\nWhat a strange girl, asking for a present back like that...Mia:\nBy the way, Mr. Wright. The day you first met Dahlia Hawthorne, eight months ago... It wouldn't happen to have been on August 27th, would it?Phoenix:\nHuh...? Y-Yeah, it was... But how did you...?Mia:\nThis happened on August 27th, right here in this courthouse.Phoenix:\nWhat's this? A newspaper clipping? Let's see... \"Murder in the Courthouse?\" M-Murder?Grossberg:\nWhat are you reading there!? Let me see that! .........! Oh, I see. Mia... I think I understand what you're trying to say. And I think I understand why you suddenly took such a keen interest in this case. You believe there is some connection between these two cases. Am I correct? (Changed from [You believe there is some relationship between these two cases. Am I correct?] in the original release)Newspaper Clipping added to the Court Record.Mia:\nI hope you don't mind, Mr. Grossberg... I... I need to finish this myself.Grossberg:\nAh, yes, but... I'm afraid what you have will not be enough, m'dear. I'll go and have a look at the downstairs reading room and see what else I can find.Mia:\nTh-Thank you!Grossberg:\nI want to do whatever I can to be of help to you, Mia! Well, it looks like recess is about over. We'd better all get moving!Mia:\n(I guess so... That recess sure seemed longer than 20 minutes though...)To be continued.April 11, 12:13 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt will now reconvene. Mr. Payne, please call your witness.Payne:\nThis next person is someone who witnessed the crime as it happened. The prosecution calls Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne to the stand!Payne:\n...Judge:\n...Mia:\n(Wh-What's with this stiff silence...?)Judge:\nIn my long career as a judge, I have been deceived by many witnesses. It's my job to doubt; to take no one at their word... But in your case, I must admit that you radiate a glow of complete sincerity.Mia:\n(I can't believe he actually said that!)Payne:\nOh! Um, now then, witness. Could you please state your full name?Dahlia:\n... I, umm...Judge:\nDon't worry, sweetie. There's no need to be nervous!Payne:\nIf anyone says anything rude, you can be sure, I'll cut them right down to size!Judge:\nAnd I will bash them with my gavel!Mia:\n(I love how they look straight at me when they say that...)Dahlia:\nUm, thank you... for calming my nerves. You are all so nice... I almost feel right at home.Payne:\nNot at all!Judge:\nIt was nothing!Mia:\nIf we may move on now... What is your full name and occupation?Dahlia:\nMy name is Dahlia Hawthorne. I'm a junior in Literature at Ivy University. I just want to say... It's an honor for me to be here in your noble presence.Payne:\nThe honor is all mine!Judge:\nNo... The honor is all mine.Mia:\n(Well, we know whose milkshake brings all the boys to the yard...)Dahlia:\n...Umm. Sir?Payne:\nIs there something I can help you with?Judge:\nYou just go on and say whatever is on your mind!Dahlia:\nI'm sure that there must be some kind of mistake. Feenie wouldn't kill anyone. I just know it!Judge:\nYes, yes... I can see why you'd say that.Mia:\n(She's going to be a tough witness, alright... It only took her 12 seconds to wrap them all around her little finger.)Judge:\nNow then, please proceed with your testimony. Let's hear about what you witnessed on the day of the incident, if you please.Witness Testimony-- What I Witnessed --Dahlia:\nI had been planning to go back to Feenie's place after class was over.\nFeenie and Dougie... They were talking behind the building.\nThen suddenly... Dougie got all wobbly and just collapsed.\nThat's when Feenie noticed that I was there.\nI went to go and find some other students and they called the authorities.Judge:\nI-I don't know what to say! According to you, Ms. Hawthorne... ...the defendant didn't do anything wrong!Payne:Payne:\nYoung lady. As old as I am, even I recall how hot the flames of young passion can burn. Nevertheless... It is my job to discover the truth. Please, tell us the truth...Dahlia:\nBut... But, I... I would never...Mia:Mia:\nThat's more than enough, witness. I won't allow this to continue.Judge:\nWh-What do you mean by that?Mia:\nPlease, just let me proceed with my cross-examination, Your Honor. I, for one, don't plan to win my case on a bunch of paper-thin lies!Dahlia:\n...Tee hee. You haven't changed a bit... Mia Fey.Mia:\n...Payne:\nWhat's this? So, you two are... acquainted?Mia:\nYes. We've met before... Once.Dahlia:\n...Judge:\nIn any case, Ms. Fey, the floor is all yours.Dahlia:\nIt's good to see you again, Madame Fey!Mia:\n\"Madame\"!? (I'm no one's grandma yet, girlie!)Cross Examination-- What I Witnessed --Dahlia:\nI had been planning to go back to Feenie's place after class was over.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nNow, unless I'm mistaken, Feenie -- I mean, Mr. Wright is in the Art Department. If that's the case, then what were you doing by the Pharmacology building?\nDahlia:\nWell... I'm in the Literature Department. I'm studying Japanese Senryu poetry.\nJudge:\nOho hoh! How wonderful! It's that humorous, yet satirical style of haiku, yes?\nDahlia:\n\"Nothing left to do... When a man reaches this age, sleep is his best friend.\"\nMia:\n(That's supposed to be poetry? Sounds more like a mid-life crisis!)\nDahlia:\nFor me to get to the Art Department, I have to walk through that back area.\nJudge:\nAh, yes I see. That makes sense. When I want to enter the courthouse, I always walk through the front doors.\nMia:\n(How else would you enter? Teleportation!?)Dahlia:\nFeenie and Dougie...They were talking behind the building.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nSo who is this \"Dougie\" person?\nDahlia:\nOh, I'm sorry. Doug Swallow. We were dating until about eight months ago...\nMia:\nSo what were Dougie-- *ahem* Mr. Swallow and Mr. Wright talking about anyway?\nDahlia:\n... H-How can you be so mean? I would never... I would never eavesdrop... I wasn't raised to be so rude and unrefined!\nPayne:\nThat's right, Ms. Fey!\nJudge:\nDon't drag the witness down to your level!\nMia:\n(Why am I being demonized here?)\nJudge:\nPlease, go on. What did you see next?Dahlia:\nThen suddenly... Dougie got all wobbly and just collapsed.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nAre you saying that the victim just collapsed on his own?\nDahlia:\nY-Yes.\nMia:\nIn other words, the defendant never touched the victim. Is that right?\nDahlia:\nI was watching the whole time. Feenie never did a thing to Dougie!\nMia:\n(If I press her for no good reason, I just know the judge will get angry with me... Hmm, so what should I do about her testimony just now?)\n\n\n\nLeave it alone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n(Hmm... I suppose her statement works in our favor, for now. I'll hold off on looking into it any deeper until it's necessary.)\nJudge:\nVery well, young lady, please go on with your testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nShow contradiction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nFeeble lies are not very becoming, Ms. Hawthorne, so let's drop them, shall we?\nDahlia:\nWh-What...! I...! I would never...!\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nMs. Fey! I will not allow you to badger this witness!\nMia:\n...\nPayne:\nI-I believe the defense is engaged in a-a... fishing expedition.\nMia:\n...\nPayne:\nThat is... Err... She has no supporting...\nMia:\n...\nPayne:\nP-Please don't glare at me like that...! I-I'm just doing my job!\nMia:\nNow then, Ms. Hawthorne. The defendant's palmprint was found on Mr. Swallow's leather jacket. It has already been shown that Mr. Wright did, in fact, push the victim.\nDahlia:\nWhat...?\nMia:\nThere's no need to try to cover for the defendant. It would be much better if you came out and told us the whole truth.\nJudge:\nHmm... There's nothing to worry about, young lady. Just tell us everything that you saw.\nDahlia:\nY-Yes, Your Honor... I-I will. If you don't mind, I-I'd like to revise my testimony.\nMia:\n(Looks like we're finally getting somewhere...)\nChanges statement from \"Then suddenly... Dougie got all wobbly and just collapsed.\" to \"Um, actually, I didn't see the moment he pushed Dougie.\"\nChanges statement from \"That's when Feenie noticed that I was there.\" to \"It didn't look like they were fighting, and I didn't hear anything unusual either.\"Dahlia:\nUm, actually, I didn't see the moment he pushed Dougie.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nYou didn't see it!?\nDahlia:\nWell, I saw the moment when Dougie fell to the ground...\nPayne:\nAnd at that time, there was only the two of them at the scene? The defendant, Phoenix Wright, and the victim, Doug Swallow?\nDahlia:\nYes... that's right.Dahlia:\nThat's when Feenie noticed that I was there.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nAnd what did Mr. Wright say when he saw you?\nDahlia:\nI-I'm sorry. I-I was so flustered that I... I really don't remember. P-Please forgive me.\nMia:\nYou don't remember...?\nJudge:\nWell, that's common enough. Sometimes I can't recall a sentence I passed only minutes prior!\nMia:\n(Please... Someone, anyone... Stop him before he gets hurt... by me.)Dahlia:\nIt didn't look like they were fighting, and I didn't hear anything unusual either. (Changed from [It didn't look like they were fighting, and I didn't hear any noise either.] in the original release)Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nSo then, what did it look like they were doing to you?\nDahlia:\nI thought they were having a nice, friendly afternoon conversation.\nMia:\n(Oh, give me a break!)\nDahlia:\nThat's why I really wasn't watching them all that closely.\nJudge:\nDid you notice anything out of the ordinary at all?\nDahlia:\nNo, nothing at all... Mr. Judge.\nJudge:\nOh, I like the sound of that! \"Mr. Judge\"... Now then, please proceed with your testimony.Present Phoenix's Testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"You say you \"didn't hear anything unusual\". Is that correct?\"Dahlia:\nI went to go and find some other students and they called the authorities.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nWhen you say \"students\" do you mean students from the Pharmacology Department?\nDahlia:\nYes. They're all very fond of their drugs...\nMia:\nPlease try to stay on topic! So to find some Pharmacology students, you went to the labs, correct?\nDahlia:\nThat's what I was planning to do... But in the end, I wound up not going. A group of about 10 research students came running out of the building entrance. Somehow they all seemed to know what was going on...\nMia:\n(The students knew what was going on...?)\n\n\n\nLeave it alone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n(The Pharmacology students... They have nothing to do with the incident. I think what I need is more information about Dahlia herself.)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress for more details\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nBut how could the students have known what was going on?\nDahlia:\nWell... I don't know for sure that they knew what had happened. It's just, they all seemed kind of excited about something.\nMia:\n(Hmm... It doesn't look like I'm going to get any more info about the students.)\nPayne:\nSo did the students call the police?\nDahlia:\nY-Yes. I-I was just so... I was so panicked...\nJudge:\nHmm. Yes, well anyone would have been, my dear.\nLeads back to cross-examinationMia:\n(That girl... She's telling a super obvious lie, and she knows it. She's just pretending to protect Mr. Wright... Yes, that's got to be it! Way to go, Mia! OK, that means I'm going to have to dig deep to find the contradiction on this one!)Mia:\nYou say you \"didn't hear anything unusual\". Is that correct? (Changed from [You say you didn't hear any noise. Is that correct?] in the original release)Dahlia:\nYes. That's why I was very relaxed, looking at the scenery around me.Mia:\nThat's nice, but I find that just a little odd. I have here, the testimony of your boyfriend, Mr. Phoenix Wright. And he clearly testified to the effect... ...that when he pushed the victim, he heard a sharp, loud noise.Dahlia:\nH-He said that?Mia:\nIf you were really that close to the two of them, why didn't you hear this noise as well?Dahlia:\nI...!Payne:Payne:\nW-Well, maybe the noise just wasn't all that memorable.Mia:Mia:\nBut according to Mr. Wright's testimony, it was a sharp noise like a \"SNAP\"! There's no way a noise like that could fail to make an impression!Payne:\nAck!!Dahlia:\nUmm... May I have a moment to answer?Judge:\nB-By all means!Dahlia:\nI know the reason why I didn't hear the noise. You see, the truth is... I had my headphones on, and I was listening to music at the time.Payne:\nH-H-Headphones...? You mean that both of your ears were covered?Dahlia:\nThe rain was just beginning to let up... But it seemed as though Thor wasn't ready for his fun to come to an end yet. So the sky continued to flash and rumble.Mia:\nThunder and lightning, huh...Dahlia:\nYes, I'm afraid of the sound of thunder. So I put my headphones on to block it out...Payne:\nHee, hee, hee, hee... Well, Your Honor? As you can see, there weren't any contradictions in her testimony after all.Judge:\nHmm...Mia:\n(Wait a sec, Mia! That testimony just now... She said something that could totally change this whole case!)She didn't hear anything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nYour Honor! There is a problem with the witness's testimony!\nJudge:\nWh-What do you mean!?\nPayne:\nWh-What is this \"problem\"!?\nMia:\nIt's obvious. The problem is that the witness claims to have not heard the \"SNAP!\"\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nA-Are you deaf!? Did you pay attention to the testimony!? She said she didn't hear it because she was listening to music with her headphones!\nJudge:\nMs. Fey! I'm surprised you're going senile before me!\nMia:\n(I'm not THAT bad! ...I think.)\nJudge:\nWell, the testimony we've just heard seems to be very decisive. The only one that could have killed the victim was the defendant, Mr. Phoenix Wright!\nDahlia:\nN-No! Please...! I-I never meant to incriminate him!\nMia:\n(This is bad, Mia! If you don't do something, we're going to lose this!! Think again! What is it about this testimony that doesn't make sense...?)\nLeads back to:\n\"She said something that could totally change this whole case!)\"She was listening to music.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nYour Honor! There is a problem with the witness's testimony!\nJudge:\nWh-What do you mean!?\nPayne:\nWh-What is this \"problem\"!?\nMia:\nIt's obvious. The problem is that she claims to have been listening to music!\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nA-Are you deaf!? Did you pay attention to the testimony!? She explained she was listening to music to cover up the sound of thunder!\nJudge:\nMs. Fey! I must warn you that I can be even more frightening than Zeus when I'm angry!\nMia:\n(Yikes! I'm in trouble now!)\nJudge:\nWell, the testimony we've just heard seems to be very decisive. The only one that could have killed the victim was the defendant, Mr. Phoenix Wright!\nDahlia:\nN-No!

There is a problem with the witness's testimony!\"Mia:\nYour Honor! There is a problem with the witness's testimony!Judge:\nWh-What do you mean!?Mia:\nDidn't you notice? She said there was lightning, correct?Judge:\nYes... What about it?Mia:\nWell, lightning is actually a large discharge of electricity in the atmosphere, am I right?Judge:\nNow's not the time for a science lesson, Ms. Fey!Mia:\nYes, Your Honor. Anyway, since the cause of death was electrocution... ...isn't it possible that the victim died from being hit by a bolt of lightning!?Judge:\nOh!Payne:\nAh!Dahlia:\n...!Judge:\nHmm... I must admit that the thought had not occurred to me!Mia:\n(Just what kind of thoughts DO occur to this guy anyway?) This entire case is built on the premise that Mr. Doug Swallow was \"murdered\"... ...but that very premise itself is mistaken! The defense believes that Mr. Swallow was, in fact, the victim of a stray bolt!Judge:\nI-It appears the defense may be on to something! Could it be that the death was actually accidental?Mia:\n(Alright, you did it, Mia! I'll be taking that \"Not Guilty\" now if you don't--)Payne:Payne:\nHee, hee, hee, hee, hee... I'm hurt that you have such a low opinion of me, Ms. Fey.Mia:\nHuh...?Payne:\nI'm not a fool, you know. The prosecution has done its research, Your Honor. We found that there were no lightning strikes on that day at that location!Mia:\nWhaaa!?Payne:\nWhat's more... We have evidence that the electrical cable is definitely linked to this case.Judge:\nE-Evidence, Mr. Payne!? Well, what is this evidence?Payne:\nThis affidavit.Judge:\nAnd who is this affidavit from?Payne:\nThe Pharmacology students who were conducting experiments in their labs that day. Allow me to read out to the court the testimony of the Pharmacology students. \"All equipment in the labs lost power all of a sudden at around 3:00 PM that day.\"Judge:\nWas it a blackout?Payne:\nAll of the labs' equipment runs of high-voltage, Your Honor.Mia:\nSo you're saying the equipment lost power because...Payne:\nPrecisely. They lost power because of the severed electrical cable. The power outage occurred at approximately 3:00 PM...Judge:\nWhich fits with the time of death listed in the autopsy report.Payne:\nExactly! In other words... The victim died as a result of touching the severed electrical cable. According to the students, the cables were very old. They were planning on having them replaced in the near future.Judge:\nHmm, I see...Payne:\nApparently the cables had become so brittle... ...that even the smallest bump would've caused them to break.Students' Testimony added to the Court Record.Judge:\nHowever... There is one thing that troubles me. If the cable could have been broken by any small bump... ...then it wouldn't have snapped if it hadn't been bumped into, correct?Payne:\nW-Well... I suppose you could say that.Judge:\nHmm, Ms. Fey. Do you have any thoughts regarding the cause of the severed cable?Mia:\nY-Your Honor... (I don't like how this is looking one bit! I have to come up with something to try to regain some momentum!) If it pleases the court, the defense would like to state its opinion.Judge:\nWell then, let's hear it. Who or what was it that caused the cable to break?Present Phoenix's Testimony or Phoenix Wright profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Your Honor. Please think back to Mr. Wright's testimony.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nThis is it! This is why the cable snapped.\nPayne:\nWell, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nI believe that the only thing that has snapped is the mind of the defense.\nPayne:\nAh, that was one of your best lines yet, Your Honor.\nMia:\nNnnfff...! (Ouch, that was harsh...) Please, Your Honor! Give me one more chance!\nLeads back to:\n\"Well then, let's hear it.\"Mia:\nYour Honor. Please think back to Mr. Wright's testimony.Judge:\nThe defendant's testimony?Mia:\nHe said that after he pushed the victim, he heard a loud, sharp noise. Now, this happened at around 3:00 PM, correct?Judge:\nYes, that sounds right. Wait! Are you saying that...Mia:\nThe lab equipment lost power at 2:55 PM... which fits right in Mr. Wright's timeline. In other words, it was Mr. Wright's shove that caused the power outage.Payne:\nYes! The prosecution also came to that same conclusion. And it was that very shove that caused Mr. Swallow to be electrocuted!Mia:Mia:\nI'm afraid I can't agree with you there, Mr. Payne.Payne:\nWh-What's that supposed to mean?Mia:\nTake a good look at where the victim landed after being shoved. See the umbrella? It's by the electrical pole. That's right. The victim banged into that pole as a result of being pushed. It was that impact that caused the cable to break.Judge:\nHmm... Well, that makes sense. And then the victim was electrocuted.Mia:\nI'm sorry Your Honor, but no. It doesn't make sense at all. If the victim was shoved into the far pole... ...then he couldn't have been electrocuted by this severed cable in the foreground here!Payne:\nAAAAAAAAAAHH!!Mia:\nIn other words... Someone other than my client must have electrocuted the victim!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court!Mia:\n(Ah, the lamentations of my enemy. How I've longed to hear them!)Judge:\nIt-It's true... The defense is absolutely correct! There doesn't seem to be any way the defendant could have done it--Dahlia:\nUmm... Mr. Judge, sir? May I say something? The madame attorney's explanation... She said some things that are a little different than I remember them.Judge:\nWh-Wh-Payne:\nWh-Wh-Mia:\nWhat the...!?Dahlia:\nPlease, just once more. May I please testify one last time? Please... Mr. Judge?Judge:\nOf course it's alright! Just go right ahead and give your new testimony!Mia:\n(This is it... She's finally starting to show her true colors!)Witness Testimony-- What I Witnessed, Part 2 --Dahlia:\nThe truth is... Feenie pushed him twice.\nThe first time was into the electrical pole. That's when the cable broke.\nThen Dougie tried his best to run away from him...\nBut Feenie caught up and crashed into him from behind.\nThe cable snapping, and Dougie being electrocuted -- it all occured [sic] in less than a minute.Judge:\nHmm... So after being shoved... ...the victim got up and tried to run away.Payne:\nAnd that is when the defendant pushed him for the second time.Dahlia:\nI'm so sorry, Feenie... But I... I just have to tell the truth. Am I doing the right thing? Am I, Mr. Judge?Judge:\nOf course you are, my dear! As painful as it may seem, you are. Now then, Ms. Fey. You may proceed with your cross-examination!Cross Examination-- What I Witnessed, Part 2 --Dahlia:\nThe truth is... Feenie pushed him twice.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nMs. Hawthorne... Previously in your testimony you said the following... \"Actually, I didn't see the moment he pushed Dougie.\"\nDahlia:\nI know... I-I'm sorry. I wanted to protect Feenie.\nMia:\nSo that's why you basically lied to the court?\nDahlia:\nI was a bad girl... I know... Um, Mr. Judge?\nJudge:\nY-Yes?\nDahlia:\nWould you please, please forgive little old me?\nMia:\nOf course he won't! What you did is called \"perjury\"...\nJudge:\nOh, come now! It was just a little old white lie! We'll forget it this time! But please be more careful from now on, alright?\nDahlia:\nOh, thank you so much, Mr. Judge.\nJudge:\nNot at all! Ho ho ho...!\nMia:\n(The judge had better be more careful himself! A dark alley is friendlier than that girl!)Dahlia:\nThe first time was into the electrical pole. That's when the cable broke.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nYou're saying you actually saw the victim get pushed into the electrical pole?\nDahlia:\nI know he doesn't look it, but Feenie can be a bit of an imp when he wants to be.\nMia:\n(Oh, really...?)\nDahlia:\nBut I never imagined that he would cause an electrical cable to break... Feenie really is scary when he gets mad...\nJudge:\nYes, he sounds like a very dangerous individual indeed.Dahlia:\nthen Dougie tried his best to run away from him...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nSo let me get this straight. You were happily listening to music on your headphones while you watched this scene unfold?\nDahlia:\nWaaaaah...\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nMs. Fey! I'll have to ask you to stop badgering the witness!\nDahlia:\nUmm... I wasn't happy... I was so scared that I couldn't even move. All I could do was stand there and cheer them on...\nMia:\nCh-Cheer them on? What do you mean by that?\nDahlia:\nWell, I wished the best for them both, and that they would each give the fight their all.\nJudge:\nHmm... That's very sweet of you to be so supportive.\nPayne:\nAnd what happened after that?Dahlia:\nBut Feenie caught up and crashed into him from behind.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nThat doesn't sound quite right... There were handprints found on the chest of the victim's leather jacket. Mr. Payne, were there also prints found on the back of his leather jacket?\nPayne:\nW-Well, um... N-No, there weren't...\nDahlia:\nMadame Fey, may I suggest that you listen a little more carefully?\nMia:\n...!?\nDahlia:\nI said that he \"crashed\" into him from behind, right? My Feenie wouldn't leave any prints behind in that case, would he?\nMia:\nUnngghh...Dahlia:\nThe cable snapping, and Dougie being electrocuted -- it all occured [sic] in less than a minute.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nDid you actually witness the moment the victim was electrocuted?\nDahlia:\nI-I'm sorry. I didn't actually see it. I... I turned my eyes away...\nPayne:\nThat's understandable.\nJudge:\nYes indeed. It would have been a horrific sight for anyone to behold.Present Crime Photo 2 or Students' Testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"That's enough, witness.\"Mia:\n(If I don't figure out the contradiction here... ...it's all over! She didn't have much time to come up with her lie, so this is my best chance. There must be a hole in her testimony somewhere! Think, Mia!)Mia:\nThat's enough, witness.Dahlia:\nI'm afraid I don't understand...Mia:\nYou will in a minute. Could you please take a look at this picture?Dahlia:\nOh. That medicine... That's the one Feenie likes to take for his cold.Mia:\nIt's not the medicine I want you to look at... It's the wristwatch. It stopped at the precise time the victim was electrocuted. In other words... 3:05 PM.Judge:\nYes, and your point is, Ms. Fey...?Mia:\nMy point is this! What time was it when the lab suffered that power outage due to the cable snapping?Payne:\nWell, according to the students' testimony, the answer is clear. It was 2:55 PM... Yeeaaaaaaarrrgghhh!!Mia:\nWould you care to explain to the court, Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne... ...what exactly happened during this 10 minute interval!?Dahlia:\n...!Mia:\nThe defense proposes that... ...it was during this interval that the real murderer killed Mr. Doug Swallow!Judge:\nOr-Order! Order in the court! What is this all ab--Payne:Payne:\nTh-This is nonsense! The \"real murderer\"...!?Mia:Mia:\nEven you can't deny that the time between the cable breaking and the electrocution... ...are completely unaccounted for!Payne:Payne:\nTh-Then who was it!? Who else are you saying could've done it!?Mia:\nThere's only one person who could have murdered Mr. Swallow. Only after my client had left the scene... ...was there a window of opportunity for the real killer!Judge:\nMs. Fey. Is the defense ready to indict someone as this \"real killer\"?Mia:\n(It's finally time. This is the moment I've been waiting for.) Yes, Your Honor. We are ready.Judge:\nVery well. But remember! If you accuse the wrong person, you will be penalized. Think very carefully before you speak, Ms. Fey. Now then, Ms. Fey. Let's have it. Who is the \"real killer\"!?Present Dahlia Hawthorne profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"It could only have been you, Dahlia Hawthorne!\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nJudge:\n...\nPayne:\n......\nDahlia:\n.........\nJudge:\nWhat's that supposed to be!?\nMia:\nErr... Umm... A bout of youthful indiscretion! ...Your Honor!\nJudge:\nMaybe so, but I still have to penalize you.\nMia:\n(Unngggh... No way! I won't let it end like this!)\nJudge:\nNow this time, I expect you to think a bit more carefully!\nLeads back to:\n\"Now then, Ms. Fey. Let's have it. Who is the \"real killer\"!?\"Mia:\nIt could only have been you, Dahlia Hawthorne!Dahlia:\nWaaaaah! H-How... H-How can you...!Payne:Payne:\nTh-The defense is grasping at straws!Mia:\nTen minutes passed between the time the cable broke and the time of the electrocution! What exactly were you doing that whole time, Ms. Hawthorne? Were you really listening to some music while \"cheering them both on\" as they fought? I find it hard to believe that you didn't lift a finger to stop the men \"dearest\" to you!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Ms. Fey! Wh-What... I mean, why... That is to say...Mia:\nMs. Hawthorne! I believe you did witness the two men fighting on that day. However! After Mr. Wright pushed the victim, and subsequently left the scene... ...it was YOU who pushed Mr. Swallow to his death by your very own hands!Dahlia:\nAAAAAAAAHHH!!! H-How can you say something so mean, Madame Fey...! I... I didn't do anything...!Judge:\nMs. Fey! This is a very serious charge you are--Phoenix:Phoenix:\nYour Honor! P-Please, I have something I want to say! *achoo*Judge:\nY-Y-You! Wh-What is it!?Phoenix:\nPlease... Please strike everything the defense said just now from the record!Mia:\nWhat the...!?

Grab that man!Phoenix:\nAaaarrgghh... *achoo* *achoo* Leave my Dollie alone! *achoo* *cough*???:\n... *sigh* That boy...Grossberg:\nHe's gotten himself in way over his head.Mia:\nOh...!

I found the police report on that incident in your newspaper clipping!Police Report added to the Court Record.Mia:\nThank you so much! This is exactly what I was hoping for!Grossberg:\nYou'd better take a good look at it... It... err... details how you came to lose your boyfriend.Judge:\nNow then, the defense has made a very serious accusation. Mr. Payne, what do you have to say about this?Payne:\nW-Well really, Your Honor... I... I... That is I...Dahlia: \nMay I interrupt you for just a moment, Mr. Prosecutor?Payne:\nAh, don't you worry, my dear. I have this situation well in hand.Dahlia:\n... ... *sniffle*Payne:\nErr, that is I... Um... G-G-Go right ahead.Dahlia:\nMadame Fey, are you seriously accusing me of killing my sweet Dougie?Mia:\nYes. I am. Not only am I saying you murdered Doug Swallow... ...but you also tried to pin the whole thing on your current lover, Phoenix Wright!Payne:Payne:\nI told you that you should let me handle this...Dahlia:\n... ... *weep*Payne:\nUrk. Sorry. P-Please go ahead.Dahlia:\nHow can you say that!? I'm absolutely devoted to my dear Feenie. The notion that I would try to frame him is ludicrous! This is all just too much for poor little me to bear!!Grossberg:\nAh, I believe the girl is trying to ask what on Earth her motive would be.Mia:\n(The answer to that lies somewhere in this police report. It must!)Mia:\nEight months ago, an incident occurred in the basement cafeteria of this building. And then... that same day, the two of them \"accidentally\" meet...Mia:\nYour Honor.

Well I have evidence that suggests that she, in fact, had a very good reason!Judge:\nVery well then, the court grants the defense's request. Young lady.

The loveliest rose can hide the cruelest thorn...Payne:Payne:\nMs. Fey! Th-That's not fair! You can't slander my witness with an unrelated case!Dahlia:\nUmm...Payne:\nI, Winston Payne, will not allow it!Dahlia:\nMr. Prosecutor... I believe I was speaking.Payne:\nUrk. P-Pardon me... G-Go right ahead...Dahlia:\nIt's true that about eight months ago... ...the police expressed some interest in me.Judge:\nHmm... Expressed some interest, huh?Dahlia:\nMr. Judge, sir... I know I'm under oath, so I'll tell you the absolute truth. I did not commit the crime that occurred during that incident eight months ago.Judge:\nI see...Mia:\n(OK... I've tied the two crimes together! Now I've just got to stay on the offensive!)Grossberg:\nWell done, Mia! Ooohhh... You've really lit a fire in my heart... And my buttocks! I can hardly tell which is more inflamed, my spirit... or my hemorrhoids!Witness Testimony-- The Poisoning --Dahlia:\nI met the lawyer who was poisoned to discuss something in the cafeteria that day.\nI left my seat for just a moment, and that's when it happened!\nFrom what I heard, it was a liquid poison that is lethal at just 2 teaspoons.\nNot only that, I heard it was a very special kind of poison.\nSo you see, I'm innocent! I wouldn't even know where to get a poison like that!Judge:\nHmm... So that's what happened here eight months ago.Payne:\nHowever, as you've heard from the witness's testimony, she had nothing to do with it. I think the defense is just about out of tricks...Mia:\nI'm terribly sorry, Mr. Payne. But I'm afraid the defense has many more tricks up its sleeve today. And I'll be sure to show them to you before the end of this cross-examination!Payne:\nUnnggh! What the...!? Why does the defense suddenly feel stronger...?Grossberg:\nAha! Mia! You're glowing with a true lawyer's aura, m'dear! That proud posture and self-confidence! Absolutely smashing!Cross Examination",

      "newContext": "-- How I Met My Feenie --Dahlia:\nI first met my darling Feenie eight months ago.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nSo until that time, you had been dating Doug Swallow?\nDahlia:\nY-Yes. I'm a real fool, I know. Letting my emotions change so quickly... I'm ashamed of myself.\nJudge:\nNo, no. Not at all! Look at me! I'm infamous for changing my mind! My critics have even taken to calling me \"Judge Fickle\"! Ho! Ho! Ho!\nMia:\n(Maybe you should look for a different line of work...)\nGrossberg:\nDespite that, however, he always, always hands down the correct verdict. That's why some people also call him \"The Great Judgini\".Dahlia:\nIt's like we were destined to meet in this very courthouse's basement reading room.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nThe courthouse reading room? That's a strange place to meet the love of your life.\nDahlia:\nThat's not true, Madame Fey. After all, Feenie was... Feenie was not only an art student, but he was also planning on becoming a lawyer.\nMia:\nI'm not talking about him. I'm talking about you, Ms. Hawthorne. What was a literature student like you doing in a courthouse reading room?\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nThis line of questioning is a waste of time! It has nothing to do with our murder case!\nJudge:\nMs. Fey, I'm warning you. If this has nothing to do with Mr. Swallow's case...\nMia:\n(I have to remember the judge is on Dahlia's side. I'd better tread carefully...)\n\n\n\nWait and see\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n(Mia, if the judge gets any angrier, you'll lose the whole case! I'll just have to hold my tongue for the time being.)\nJudge:\nNow then, young lady, please go on with your testimony. Tell us about the time you first met Phoenix Wright.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nKeep pressing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nYour Honor, if you'll allow me some latitude, I think I can establish relevance. Please ask her to continue on with her testimony!\nJudge:\nVery well. Young lady, I've got a simple question for you. What were you doing downstairs in the courthouse reading room?\nDahlia:\nIf it pleases Your Honor, the answer is simply this.\nAdds statement \"I had come to this courthouse to do some research for a paper I was writing.\"Press (after adding statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nThe courthouse reading room? That's a strange place to meet the love of your life.\nDahlia:\nThat's not true, Madame Fey. After all, Feenie was... Feenie was not only an art student, but he was also planning on becoming a lawyer.\nMia:\nI'm not talking about him. I'm talking about you, Ms. Hawthorne. What was a literature student like you doing in a courthouse reading room?\nDahlia:\nTee hee. There's nothing strange about that, ma'am.Dahlia:\nI had come to this courthouse to do some research for a paper I was writing.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nYou were writing a paper? On what?\nDahlia:\nOn the relationship between modern Senryu poetry and the criminal underworld.\nJudge:\nHo ho ho. That sounds like a fascinating research idea.\nDahlia:\n\"Am I getting old? Now I've even forgotten what I've forgotten...\"\nMia:\n(Again with the mid-life crisis stuff!?)\nGrossberg:\nMia, why did that girl really come to this courthouse? Isn't that what you wanted to know? And speaking of forgetting things, you haven't forgotten the police report, have you? I went through a lot of trouble to get it, m'dear, so be sure to read it carefully.Present Police Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Ms. Hawthorne, you weren't here because of your research paper, were you?\"Dahlia:\nThe moment our eyes met, my heart skipped a beat!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nHmm... So what was it about Mr. Wright that made your heart malfunction like that? In my personal opinion, he just looks like a typical snotty-nosed college brat.\nDahlia:\nPerhaps to a woman your age. But to me, Feenie is handsome!\nMia:\nPerhaps to you, Ms. Hawthorne. But to the rest of the planet, he's a dime a dozen.\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nLove is a mysterious thing, and I object to this line of questioning! If you were to look at my wife for example, you might all be shocked!\nJudge:\nHe's telling the truth. It was truly, truly shocking.\nDahlia:\n\"Beautiful mushroom, growing tall in the darkness. It comes from cow dung.\" That's the poem that best describes how I feel about my Feenie.Dahlia:\nWe've been going out ever since that fateful day.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n\nMia:\nWere there any bad feelings between you and Mr. Swallow?\nDahlia:\nNo, none at all. We parted on very good terms.\nMia:\nBut that can't be!\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nOur investigation also shows that it was a clean breakup.\nMia:\nHuh... Are you... Are you sure?\nPayne:\nYes, it seems that they both wanted it that way.\nMia:\n(So the victim wanted to break up with her...?)\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\nSo you're saying that Mr. Swallow also wanted to break up with you?\nDahlia:\nW-Well, y-you see...\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nWhat a cruel thing to ask a lovely young lady like this! ... By the way, I have never ONCE considered leaving MY wife!\nJudge:\nNo one cares, Mr. Payne.\nMia:\n(She didn't deny it... That must mean... Doug Swallow must have seen through her little act. He must have gotten a glimpse of her true nature.)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nBack off\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMia:\n(What did the victim think of Dahlia Hawthorne...? Well, I guess I don't have to think about that now...)\nLeads back to cross-examinationGrossberg:\nListen to me, Mia. That woman has the judge in the palm of her hand, you see. So the only way to discredit her is to find a contradiction in her testimony!Mia:\nMs. Hawthorne, you weren't here because of your research paper, were you? Didn't you actually come here for a much more important reason?Dahlia:\n...!Payne:Payne:\nWh-What is the meaning of that cocky smile on your face, Ms. Fey!?Mia:\nEight months ago, right here in this very courthouse, there was another tragedy.Payne:\nAnother tragedy...?Judge:\nDo you mean the incident in which an attorney was poisoned?Dahlia:\n...Mia:\nThe name of the suspect in that incident is listed here in this report. And that name is... Dahlia Hawthorne!Payne:\nWhat!?Judge:\nD-Dahlia H-Hawthorne!?Mia:\nYes! The sweetie-pie of everyone's eye, Ms. Dahlia Hawthorne!

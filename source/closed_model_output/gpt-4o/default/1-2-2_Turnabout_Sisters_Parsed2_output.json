(Miles Edgeworth... I'd better not show any signs of weakness today, or he'll be on me in an instant.)Judge:\nMr. Edgeworth. Please give the court your opening statement.Edgeworth:\nThank you, Your Honor. The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, was at the scene of the crime. The prosecution has evidence she committed this murder... and we have a witness who saw her do it. The prosecution sees no reason to doubt the facts of this case, Your Honor.Judge:\nI see. Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Let's begin then.Edgeworth:\nIf we may call our first witness, Your Honor. (Changed from [You may call your first witness.] in the original release) The prosecution calls the chief officer at the scene, Detective Gumshoe!Edgeworth:\nWitness, please state your name and profession to the court.Gumshoe:\nSir! My name's Dick Gumshoe, sir! I'm the detective in charge of homicides down at the precinct, sir!Edgeworth:\nDetective Gumshoe. Please, describe for us the details of this murder.Gumshoe:\nVery well, sir! Let me use this floor map of the office to explain. The body was found by this window, here.Edgeworth:\nAnd the cause of death?Gumshoe:\nLoss of blood due to being struck by a blunt object, sir! The murder weapon was a statue of \"The Thinker\" found next to the body, sir! It was heavy enough to be a deadly weapon, even in a girl's hands, sir!Judge:\nThe court accepts the statue as evidence.Phoenix:\n(They're still calling it a \"statue\"...)Floor Plans added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:\nNow, Detective...Gumshoe:\nY-yes sir!Edgeworth:\nYou immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey, who was found at the scene, correct? Can you tell me why?Gumshoe:\nYes sir! I had hard evidence she did it, sir!Judge:\nHmm. Detective Gumshoe. Please testify to the court about this \"hard evidence.\"Witness Testimony-- Maya Fey's Arrest --Gumshoe:\nAs soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!\nThere were two people there already:\nThe defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.\nI immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey!\nWhy? We had a witness account describing her!\nThe witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder!Judge:\nHmm... The very moment, you say. Very well. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:\nY-yes, Your Honor. (Cross-examine what...? I couldn't see a single contradiction in that testimony...)...whoosh...SMACK!Phoenix:\n(Hey! Maya just threw something at me... What's this? \"When my sister couldn't find any contradictions in a witness's testimony she would bluff it and press the witness on every detail! The witness always slips up and says something wrong... It worked lots of times!\" Heh... I should have expected Maya would know some of her sister's tricks! Alright. Let's give this a try!)Judge:\nSomething the matter?Phoenix:\nNo, Your Honor. I'd like to begin my cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Maya Fey's Arrest --Gumshoe:\nAs soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWho did you say you got a call from?\nGumshoe:\nHey pal, don't play dumb! You know who! The call was from a customer at the Gatewater Hotel, right across from the crime scene!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... okay, I pressed. Not sure it did much, though.) Right. Please continue.Gumshoe:\nThere were two people there already:Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe, how long would you say it took, between you receiving the call, and your arrival at the scene of the crime?\nGumshoe:\nHmm, right... I'd say it was about 3 minutes!\nPhoenix:\nTh-that's pretty fast!\nGumshoe:\nOur motto this month is \"quick response\"! That's how I got there before the killer got away!\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed! So, tell us who the two people you found on the scene were.\nGumshoe:\nYes sir!Gumshoe:\nThe defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely sure it was us?\nGumshoe:\nListen pal, your dumb act will only get you so far! With her funky hippie clothes and your spiky hair? You two stand out like... like suspicious people at a crime scene!\nPhoenix:\n(Well... he does have a point about her. She is pretty unmistakable. I should pick my points to press with a little more care...)Gumshoe:\nI immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy's that? What's your reason?Gumshoe:\nWhy? We had a witness account describing her!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Hold on just one second!\"Gumshoe:\nThe witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Hold on just one second!\"Phoenix:\n(I can't see a single contradiction in there! I'll just have to take Maya's advice and press him on anything suspicious!)Phoenix:\nHold on just one second!Gumshoe:\nY-yeah?Phoenix:\nIf I heard correctly... You said you arrested her because you had \"hard evidence\" she did it, correct?Gumshoe:\nHuh? Did... did I say that? Me?Phoenix:\nI heard you say it!Judge:\nYou did say it.Edgeworth:\nYou said it.Phoenix:\nExactly what about this suspicious woman in pink's claim was \"hard evidence\"!?Gumshoe:\nWh-what!? Miss May isn't suspicious, and she sure isn't pink, pal! W-well, I guess she is pink...Judge:\nThat's enough, Detective Gumshoe. Do you have any more solid proof other than her claims, Detective?Gumshoe:\nUmm...Phoenix:\n(Hmm! I guess pressing can have its advantages!)Gumshoe:\n... Yes.Phoenix:\n(Gah!)Gumshoe:\nSorry, I got the order of things mixed up in my testimony, Your Honor Sir! There was something I should have told you about first, Your Honor!Judge:\nVery well, Detective. Let's hear your testimony again.Witness Testimony-- Hard Evidence --Gumshoe:\nAfter securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.\nI found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!\nOn it, the word \"Maya\" was written clearly in blood!\nLab test results showed that the blood was the victim's!\nAlso, there was blood found on the victim's finger!\nBefore she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!\nHow you like that? That's my \"hard evidence\"!Judge:\nHmm... Before we begin cross-examination, I have a question for you, Detective.Gumshoe:\nY-Your Honor?Judge:\nWhy didn't you testify about this vital piece of evidence the first time!?Gumshoe:\nAh... eh... I know. I'm real embarrassed I forgot about it, Your Honor Sir.Judge:\nTry to be more careful! Very well, the defense may begin its cross-examination.Cross Examination",

Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:\nY-yes, Your Honor. (Cross-examine what...? I couldn't see a single contradiction in that testimony...)...whoosh...SMACK!Phoenix:\n(Hey! Maya just threw something at me... What's this? \"When my sister couldn't find any contradictions in a witness's testimony she would bluff it and press the witness on every detail! The witness always slips up and says something wrong... It worked lots of times!\" Heh... I should have expected Maya would know some of her sister's tricks! Alright. Let's give this a try!)Judge:\nSomething the matter?Phoenix:\nNo, Your Honor. I'd like to begin my cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Maya Fey's Arrest --Gumshoe:\nAs soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWho did you say you got a call from?\nGumshoe:\nHey pal, don't play dumb! You know who! The call was from a customer at the Gatewater Hotel, right across from the crime scene!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... okay, I pressed. Not sure it did much, though.) Right. Please continue.Gumshoe:\nThere were two people there already:Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe, how long would you say it took, between you receiving the call, and your arrival at the scene of the crime?\nGumshoe:\nHmm, right... I'd say it was about 3 minutes!\nPhoenix:\nTh-that's pretty fast!\nGumshoe:\nOur motto this month is \"quick response\"! That's how I got there before the killer got away!\nEdgeworth:\nIndeed! So, tell us who the two people you found on the scene were.\nGumshoe:\nYes sir!Gumshoe:\nThe defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely sure it was us?\nGumshoe:\nListen pal, your dumb act will only get you so far! With her funky hippie clothes and your spiky hair? You two stand out like... like suspicious people at a crime scene!\nPhoenix:\n(Well... he does have a point about her. She is pretty unmistakable. I should pick my points to press with a little more care...)Gumshoe:\nI immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy's that? What's your reason?Gumshoe:\nWhy?

I'll just have to take Maya's advice and press him on anything suspicious!)Phoenix:\nHold on just one second!Gumshoe:\nY-yeah?Phoenix:\nIf I heard correctly... You said you arrested her because you had \"hard evidence\" she did it, correct?Gumshoe:\nHuh? Did... did I say that? Me?Phoenix:\nI heard you say it!Judge:\nYou did say it.Edgeworth:\nYou said it.Phoenix:\nExactly what about this suspicious woman in pink's claim was \"hard evidence\"!?Gumshoe:\nWh-what!? Miss May isn't suspicious, and she sure isn't pink, pal! W-well, I guess she is pink...Judge:\nThat's enough, Detective Gumshoe. Do you have any more solid proof other than her claims, Detective?Gumshoe:\nUmm...Phoenix:\n(Hmm! I guess pressing can have its advantages!)Gumshoe:\n... Yes.Phoenix:\n(Gah!)Gumshoe:\nSorry, I got the order of things mixed up in my testimony, Your Honor Sir! There was something I should have told you about first, Your Honor!Judge:\nVery well, Detective. Let's hear your testimony again.Witness Testimony-- Hard Evidence --Gumshoe:\nAfter securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.\nI found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!\nOn it, the word \"Maya\" was written clearly in blood!\nLab test results showed that the blood was the victim's!\nAlso, there was blood found on the victim's finger!\nBefore she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!\nHow you like that? That's my \"hard evidence\"!Judge:\nHmm... Before we begin cross-examination, I have a question for you, Detective.Gumshoe:\nY-Your Honor?Judge:\nWhy didn't you testify about this vital piece of evidence the first time!?Gumshoe:\nAh... eh... I know. I'm real embarrassed I forgot about it, Your Honor Sir.Judge:\nTry to be more careful! Very well, the defense may begin its cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Hard Evidence --Gumshoe:\nAfter securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd did you find any evidence?\nGumshoe:\nNow, now, don't jump the gun on me, pal. Just listen. I'm getting to the good part!\nPhoenix:\n(I got a bad feeling about this...)Gumshoe:\nI found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nJust because you found it next to the body doesn't mean the victim wrote it!\nGumshoe:\nHo hoh! Then who did write it, smarty-pants?\nPhoenix:\nWh-who? Um...\n\n\n\nThe killer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nTh-the killer! Anyone can see that!\nGumshoe:\nHoh. You're saying the killer wrote her OWN name!? Buddy, please!\nPhoenix:\nShe was framed!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nHold on. If that's the case, where's your evidence?\nPhoenix:\nAh... (Urk!)\nEdgeworth:\nHah! I guess that was a bit of a tall order for you. Those without evidence shouldn't open their mouths, Mr. Wright.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(Argh...!)\nLeads to:\n\"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found.\"\n\n\n\n\nMiss May\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell... it could have been the witness, Miss May!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nHold on. The witness was in her hotel room, not the office. Try pulling the other leg, Mr. Wright!\nGumshoe:\nYeah, and while you're at it, pull mine too, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(Argh...!)\nLeads to:\n\"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found.\"\n\n\n\n\nI did\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt... it could have been me!\nGumshoe:\nWhat! S-so it was you!\nPhoenix:\nNo, no, no, I'm just saying it COULD have been me! Can you prove it wasn't?\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nHold on. So, you admit to this? You admit that you wrote the note?\nPhoenix:\nUh...\nEdgeworth:\nListen to me, Mr. Wright. This is a court of law, and I expect you to refrain from making thoughtless statements! Amateur!\nPhoenix:\n(...!)\nLeads to:\n\"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found.\"\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nWell, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found.Present Mia's Autopsy Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Detective Gumshoe!\"Gumshoe:\nOn it, the word \"Maya\" was written clearly in blood!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDo you have proof it was Mia who wrote that!?\nGumshoe:\nOf course I do, pal!\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh... he sounded pretty confident.

I-I refuse to testify on this matter, sir! I'm no expert on blood tests!\nJudge:\nYes, that was quite clear. You may continue with your testimony.\nGumshoe:\nTh-thanks, pal. I mean Your Honor Sir.\nEdgeworth:\nDetective Gumshoe.\nGumshoe:\nY-yeah?\nEdgeworth:\nI think you can expect a pleasant bonus in your next pay check.\nGumshoe:\nOh? Oh hoh hoh.\nPhoenix:\n(That was a mess...)\nGumshoe:\nRight! Where was I?Present Mia's Autopsy Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Detective Gumshoe!\"Gumshoe:\nAlso, there was blood found on the victim's finger!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nOn which hand was the bloody finger, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nThe right hand!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... she WAS right handed...)\nGumshoe:\nHah hah hah!

Do you get a lot of cases where the victim actually writes the killer's name?\nGumshoe:\nSure! It happens all the time in books and the movies!\nPhoenix:\nThis isn't a movie, Detective.\nGumshoe:\nOof!\nPhoenix:\nLet's talk about reality, shall we?\nGumshoe:\nUmm... I guess, I haven't heard of many cases... no.\nPhoenix:\nDon't you find it a little odd that the victim would write down a name? Especially the name of her own sister?\nGumshoe:\nAh, yeah, actually, you got a point, pal.\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nStop right there. The witness's opinion on the matter is irrelevant! The facts are clear: the victim wrote down the name of the accused... The victim told us the name of her killer!\nJudge:\nOrder!

What he said!Present Mia's Autopsy Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Detective Gumshoe!\"Phoenix:\n(That's his whole testimony... Okay, there has to be a contradiction in there somewhere. Let's find it!)Phoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe! There's one thing I want you to clarify for me here. You say that the victim, Mia Fey, wrote this note. That she was accusing the defendant, Maya Fey? That's really what you're saying?Gumshoe:\nWh-what? This isn't one of those lawyer tricks, now, is it? Of course she wrote it! Who else could have!?Phoenix:\nYou have it backwards, Detective.Gumshoe:\nB-backwards?Phoenix:\nThe victim is the only person who absolutely could NOT have written it! This is a report from your department, Detective. \"Immediate death due to a blow from a blunt object.\" She died immediately!Gumshoe:\nBut...!Phoenix:\nNo \"but\"-ing your way out of this one, Detective!Judge:\nOrder! Order! The defense has a point. Someone who died immediately wouldn't have the time to write anything down.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nMr. Wright. I beg your pardon, but when exactly did you obtain that autopsy report?Phoenix:\nWh-when...!?The day of the murder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI... I'm pretty sure it was the day of the murder.\nGumshoe:\nYou're wrong there, pal! We didn't write an autopsy report 'til the day after!\nPhoenix:\nOh.

But there is a possibility the victim lived for several minutes after the blow.\" I received these results this morning.Phoenix:\nN-no way!Edgeworth:\nYour Honor! It's quite easy to imagine that the victim did have time to write \"Maya\"! That is all.Judge:\nI see!Phoenix:\n(Damn you, Edgeworth! I should have known you'd have something up your sleeve!)Edgeworth:\nWhy, Mr. Wright, you look shocked! Something you want to say?You're a sham, Edgeworth!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. Edgeworth... I've heard there's nothing you won't do to get your verdict... What reason could you possibly have had to request a second autopsy report?\nJudge:\nMr. Wright!

The evidence strongly suggests the victim was identifying the killer.Judge:\nI suppose that's the obvious conclusion, yes.Phoenix:\n(Darn! This isn't good!)Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution would like to call its next witness. This poor, innocent girl saw the murder with her own eyes!Judge:\nLet the witness Miss April May take the stand.Phoenix:\n(Exactly what part of her is \"innocent\"...?)Edgeworth:\nWitness, your name, please.April:\nApril May!

Law Offices?April:\nMmm... that's right, big boy.Judge:\nPlease testify to the court about what you saw.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --April:\nIt was, like, 9:00 at night. I looked out the window, y'know!\nAnd then, oooh! I saw a woman with long hair being attacked!\nThe one attacking her was the mousey girl sitting in the defendant's chair!\nThen the woman, like, dodged to one side and ran away!\nBut that girl, she caught up to her and... and... She hit her!\nThen the woman with long hair...\nShe kinda... slumped.\nThe end. That's all I saw. Every little bitsy witsy! *wink*Judge:\nHmm...Edgeworth:\nWell, Your Honor?Judge:\nI see. It is a remarkably solid testimony. I don't see a need to trouble the witness any...Phoenix:\nW-wait, Your Honor!Judge:\nYes, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nWhat about my cross-examination!?Judge:\nI thought the witness's testimony just now was quite... firm. Didn't you?Edgeworth:\nMr. Wright... I understand you were Ms. Mia Fey's understudy, were you not? You must know her techniques well. Her cowardly way of finding tiny faults in perfectly good testimonies...Phoenix:\nH-hey! How dare you!Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Will you cross-examine the witness?Yes, I'm doing it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI'll gladly proceed with the cross-examination. (If only because I have a feeling Edgeworth doesn't want me to!

And everyone in the court keeps siding with her. I'd better not press too hard on this one. Maybe I should just listen to the testimony again.)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nI question your testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Hold on a minute! That testimony stinks!\"Phoenix:\n(Hmm... that's it? Nothing really jumps out as a contradiction... There's got to be something in there somewhere! Maybe I'd better just press her on the facts a bit!)Phoenix:\nHold on a minute! That testimony stinks!April:\nW-what!?Phoenix:\nMiss May, I'm willing to bet that...You saw nothing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nDid you really see the defendant at all!?\nLeads to:\n\"Urp!\"You're lying\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you telling the truth? Did you really see the defendant!?\nLeads to:\n\"Urp!\"April:\nUrp!Judge:\nMr. Wright! What's the meaning of this?April:\nYes, what is the meaning! Somebody tell me because I'm clueless! About this, I mean!Phoenix:\nOkay... If you had really witnessed my client, Maya Fey... You would have noticed her clothes before noticing her physique!April:\n...!Phoenix:\nNo one wears clothes like this on a daily basis! Except her! And I'm no expert on fashion, but her hairdo looks far from normal to me! However, the witness's testimony mentions neither of these things! The testimony is bogus!April:\nBut... but!Judge:\nStill, we don't know if she was dressed that way the night of the murder...Phoenix:\nShe was, Your Honor! I saw her. And so did Detective Gumshoe! What do you say to that, Miss May?April:\nRowr! What are you trying to say, you mean lawyer! I-I saw what I saw. I... just didn't think all the trifling little details were necessary, darling.Judge:\nMiss May. The court would like to remind you to please omit nothing in your testimony.April:\nI'm sorry, Your Honor. I'll be a good girl. I promise. *wink*Judge:\nYour testimony again, if you would.Phoenix:\n(Damn, I almost had her!)Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --April:\nI did see everything! I did!\nThe victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right.\nThen the girl in the hippie clothes ran after her...\nAnd she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did!\nThat... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? \"The Thinker,\" I think?\nWell? Does the accuracy of my report not startle you? Tee hee!Judge:\nI... see. I only wish you had been so detailed from the beginning. Please begin the cross-examination.Cross Examination",

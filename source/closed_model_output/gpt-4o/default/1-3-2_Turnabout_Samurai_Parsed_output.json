Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution will show the court that at 2:30 PM on October 15, the defendant, Mr. Will Powers, killed fellow actor Jack Hammer at Studio One of Global Studios. It is impossible for anyone else to have committed this heinous crime. The evidence presented during the trial will all point to this fact.Judge:\nHmm. I see. Very well, I would like to move on to your testimony. Mr. Edgeworth, the prosecution may call its first witness.Edgeworth:\nVery well, I call a most familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand. (Changed from [First, I would like to call a familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand.] in the original release)Edgeworth:\nDetective, if you would briefly describe this case to the court?Gumshoe:\nYes sir! I'll explain with the guidemap here. To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see? This here is the Employee Area. The actors did a run-through of their action scenes during the morning here. This is the main gate to the studios. The security lady that works at the studios was here at 1:00 PM on that day. Past the security station there is a gate, see? Past that are the studios. And here it is... Studio One. This is the scene of the murder, where the body was found! Now, on the day of the murder, October 15, there were only three people here. The victim, Jack Hammer, the defendant, Will Powers, and a young woman, the production assistant. All the production staff were in the Employee Area until noon. Then after lunch, the victim, Jack Hammer, went to Studio One. Right after that, at 1:00 PM, the security lady got to the guard station. Now, jump ahead to later that day... 5:00 PM. The production staff came to Studio One to perform a rehearsal. Needless to say, the rehearsal was cancelled... The time of death was 2:30 PM. The \"Samurai Spear\" found lodged in the victim's chest was the murder weapon. That's the case, in brief. Anyone like to hear that again?Phoenix:\n(Hmm... should I listen to that whole thing again...?)Skip it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"I think I can probably remember that...\"Listen again\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry, could you describe that one more time?\nGumshoe:\nI shoulda known it would be you, pal! Fine. Once more for the mentally-challenged lawyer.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, yeah. Live it up while you can, Gumshoe.)\nLeads back to:\n\"To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see?\"Phoenix:\n(I think I can probably remember that...)Judge:\nSo the murder weapon was a \"spear\"? How... medieval!Samurai Spear added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:\nYour Honor. This case is quite simple if you ask one question: And that question is: \"What did the security lady at the guard station see?\"Judge:\nUnderstood.Edgeworth:\nLet's call this security officer to the stand!Edgeworth:\nWill the witness declare her name?Oldbag:\n... Hmm? My, aren't you a handsome fellow! I'm afraid I'm a bit flustered!Edgeworth:\nY-your name, please!Oldbag:\nOh, dearie! No need for you to be embarrassed! Just call me \"grandma.\"Edgeworth:\nYOUR NAME, PLEASE!Phoenix:\n(Seems Edgeworth has a bit of trouble getting his witnesses to say their names...)Oldbag:\nWendy Oldbag, dearie. So just call me \"grandma.\" It's practically my name! So even when I was young I was an Oldbag, but not really that was just my name dearie. Still how the other children would make fun of me and just because of my name can you believe it? But there was this boy, the captain of the chess club in junior high, and when he called me an old bag well I just cried and cried because I had a crush on him you see--Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nO-objection! I... object to the witness's talkativeness.Judge:\nObjection sustained! The witness will refrain from rambling on the stand.Oldbag:\nI was just getting to the good part, dearie!Edgeworth:\nPerhaps we can get to the testimony?Judge:\nNow, the witness was stationed at the main gate on the day of the murder, correct?Oldbag:\nYessey I was.Judge:\nAnd to get to the scene of the murder, someone would have to pass by you?Oldbag:\nYou know your stuff, dearie!Judge:\n... You may begin your testimony.Phoenix:\n(She sure is one hell of an Oldbag...)Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Oldbag:\nOn the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.\nPoor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.\nI, well, I had some errands to run that morning.\nAnyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.\nI was at the main gate from then until 5:00!\nNow, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?\nInteresting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.\nIt was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!Judge:\nYou saw the defendant, then? Hmm... Very well. Let's begin the cross-examination.

Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution will show the court that at 2:30 PM on October 15, the defendant, Mr. Will Powers, killed fellow actor Jack Hammer at Studio One of Global Studios. It is impossible for anyone else to have committed this heinous crime. The evidence presented during the trial will all point to this fact.Judge:\nHmm. I see. Very well, I would like to move on to your testimony. Mr. Edgeworth, the prosecution may call its first witness.Edgeworth:\nVery well, I call a most familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand. (Changed from [First, I would like to call a familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand.] in the original release)Edgeworth:\nDetective, if you would briefly describe this case to the court?Gumshoe:\nYes sir! I'll explain with the guidemap here. To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see? This here is the Employee Area. The actors did a run-through of their action scenes during the morning here. This is the main gate to the studios. The security lady that works at the studios was here at 1:00 PM on that day. Past the security station there is a gate, see? Past that are the studios. And here it is... Studio One. This is the scene of the murder, where the body was found! Now, on the day of the murder, October 15, there were only three people here. The victim, Jack Hammer, the defendant, Will Powers, and a young woman, the production assistant. All the production staff were in the Employee Area until noon. Then after lunch, the victim, Jack Hammer, went to Studio One. Right after that, at 1:00 PM, the security lady got to the guard station. Now, jump ahead to later that day... 5:00 PM. The production staff came to Studio One to perform a rehearsal. Needless to say, the rehearsal was cancelled... The time of death was 2:30 PM. The \"Samurai Spear\" found lodged in the victim's chest was the murder weapon. That's the case, in brief. Anyone like to hear that again?Phoenix:\n(Hmm... should I listen to that whole thing again...?)Skip it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"I think I can probably remember that...\"Listen again\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI'm sorry, could you describe that one more time?\nGumshoe:\nI shoulda known it would be you, pal! Fine. Once more for the mentally-challenged lawyer.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, yeah. Live it up while you can, Gumshoe.)\nLeads back to:\n\"To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see?\"Phoenix:\n(I think I can probably remember that...)Judge:\nSo the murder weapon was a \"spear\"? How... medieval!Samurai Spear added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:\nYour Honor. This case is quite simple if you ask one question: And that question is: \"What did the security lady at the guard station see?\"Judge:\nUnderstood.Edgeworth:\nLet's call this security officer to the stand!Edgeworth:\nWill the witness declare her name?Oldbag:\n... Hmm? My, aren't you a handsome fellow! I'm afraid I'm a bit flustered!Edgeworth:\nY-your name, please!Oldbag:\nOh, dearie! No need for you to be embarrassed! Just call me \"grandma.\"Edgeworth:\nYOUR NAME, PLEASE!Phoenix:\n(Seems Edgeworth has a bit of trouble getting his witnesses to say their names...)Oldbag:\nWendy Oldbag, dearie. So just call me \"grandma.\" It's practically my name! So even when I was young I was an Oldbag, but not really that was just my name dearie. Still how the other children would make fun of me and just because of my name can you believe it? But there was this boy, the captain of the chess club in junior high, and when he called me an old bag well I just cried and cried because I had a crush on him you see--Edgeworth:Edgeworth:\nO-objection! I... object to the witness's talkativeness.Judge:\nObjection sustained! The witness will refrain from rambling on the stand.Oldbag:\nI was just getting to the good part, dearie!Edgeworth:\nPerhaps we can get to the testimony?Judge:\nNow, the witness was stationed at the main gate on the day of the murder, correct?Oldbag:\nYessey I was.Judge:\nAnd to get to the scene of the murder, someone would have to pass by you?Oldbag:\nYou know your stuff, dearie!Judge:\n... You may begin your testimony.Phoenix:\n(She sure is one hell of an Oldbag...)Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Oldbag:\nOn the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.\nPoor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.\nI, well, I had some errands to run that morning.\nAnyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.\nI was at the main gate from then until 5:00!\nNow, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?\nInteresting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.\nIt was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!Judge:\nYou saw the defendant, then? Hmm... Very well. Let's begin the cross-examination. Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.Cross Examination-- Witness's Account --Oldbag:\nOn the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo up until that time, anyone who wanted to could go into the studio?\nOldbag:\nWell, there wasn't a security guard at the gate, no. But the main gate was locked, dearie. You'd need an employee cardkey to get in.\nPhoenix:\n(Right... the cardkey that I have. So, what she's saying is no one who wasn't supposed to be there could get in.)\nEdgeworth:\nWas there anyone at the studios when you arrived at the guard station?Oldbag:\nPoor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nA \"run-through\"...?\nOldbag:\nThey were working out a scene between the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate. They got the basics figured out by noon, and were to use the afternoon for practice. Rehearsal was supposed to start at 5:00. That's why poor old Hammer went to Studio One in the afternoon.\nPhoenix:\n(So Powers was in his dressing room sleeping... when he was supposed to be practicing! Talk about a laid-back hero...)\nEdgeworth:\nIf there was a run-through in the morning, why did you only get there after noon?Oldbag:\nI, well, I had some errands to run that morning.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat kind of \"errands\"?\nOldbag:\nOh, well, you know.\nPhoenix:\nAnswer the question!\nOldbag:\nActually... I was watching poor Hammer and Powers. Observing, you know?\nPhoenix:\nO-observing? Weren't you supposed to be at the guard station?\nOldbag:\nWhippersnapper! I told you I locked the gate, didn't I? I did my job!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm not sure your boss would see it that way...)\nOldbag:\nAnyway! I always watch Hammer's run-throughts. Always! Never missed one in all my years.\nMaya:\nWow! I want to see a Steel Samurai run-through too!\nPhoenix:\nYou could quit being a spirit medium and take up guard duty.\nMaya:\nNot a bad idea...Oldbag:\nAnyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid you see the victim then?\nOldbag:\nDid I see poor old Hammer? Nope. He'd already gone to the studio before I got back to the guard station.\nEdgeworth:\nTell us what happened next.Oldbag:\nI was at the main gate from then until 5:00!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you were watching there the WHOLE time? No breaks? Not even a second?\nOldbag:\nO-of course! I am a professional, you know! Our are you criticizing how I do my job!? Whippersnapper!\nPhoenix:\nNo, it's just, after seeing you eating those donuts in the guard station yesterday...\nOldbag:\nI can watch the gate and eat donuts at the same time! Snipperwhapper!\nMaya:\n\"Snipperwhapper\"...? Old windbag is losing it, Nick.\nPhoenix:\nWhy don't you raise an objection?\nJudge:\nSo, the witness was on duty through the afternoon, the whole time. Very well. What did you see?Oldbag:\nNow, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow did you know that?\nOldbag:\nOh hoh hoh. I have my ways! That over-dressed young detective told me. I fed him some donuts and he talked and talked... If you ask me, that detective isn't cut out for his job.\nEdgeworth:\n...\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Detective Gumshoe, getting chewed out by a security guard...)Oldbag:\nInteresting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n2:00? You're sure?\nOldbag:\nSure as spit!\nJudge:\nWell, who was the man!?\nOldbag:\nReally, you should try not to get so excited at your age. You might strain something.\nJudge:\n...\nOldbag:\nNow, now, don't get your skivvies all in a bunch. I'll tell you who it was!Present Powers's(?) Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag!\"Oldbag:\nIt was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you saw Mr. Powers?\nOldbag:\nThat's what I said! Got wax in your ears, sonny?\nMaya:\nNick, this is your chance!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, time to pull out the secret weapon...\nOldbag:\nI'll say it again! It was him!Present Powers's(?) Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag!\"Maya:\nNick... Doesn't she seem like she's enjoying this a little too much?Phoenix:\nWindbags love gossiping about other people's misfortunes.Maya:\nUgh. Can't she get her kicks somewhere else?Phoenix:\nLet me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag! You've been saying since yesterday that you \"saw Mr. Powers,\" correct? But you're talking about the man in this photo, aren't you!Judge:\nJ-just a moment, Mr. Wright. Let me see that photo! ... What is this, exactly?Phoenix:\nNone other than the Steel Samurai, defender of Neo Olde Tokyo. Ms. Oldbag! Is this the \"Mr. Powers\" that you saw!?Oldbag:\nOf course! Didn't your momma teach you any sense, sonny? Anyone can plainly see that's Powers! Right?Edgeworth:\nNo, they can't! (Changed from [Um, yeah.] in the original release) ... Umm... well. I mean, I wonder? (Changed from [Umm... well. I wonder?] in the original release)Phoenix:\nTrue, Mr. Powers does play the role of the Steel Samurai! But that doesn't mean Mr. Powers IS the Steel Samurai!Oldbag:\n...! I... I know that! I wasn't born yesterday!Judge:\nNo one in this court is accusing you of that, Ms... er, witness.Phoenix:\n(He's having trouble calling her \"Oldbag\" apparently...)Judge:\nHowever, you do not have proof that the person in this photo is Mr. Will Powers, do you?Oldbag:\nHumph! Nosy old man! Of course I have proof!Phoenix:\nWhat!?Edgeworth:\nHuh!?Phoenix:\n(Even Edgeworth is surprised!?)Edgeworth:\nThe prosecution would like to ask the old... the witness. Please make known all the information in your possession ahead of time!Oldbag:\nHow was I to know everyone would be so nosy! You should be ashamed, all of you! Anyway, I showed that photo to the young detective. He told me \"this isn't any good as evidence, pal.\" He didn't even give it a second look!Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\n(Wow, old windbag has left even Edgeworth speechless. She's good!)Judge:\nLet's hear about your proof, then.Witness Testimony-- The Man in the Photo --Oldbag:\nI never say anything I don't mean, mind you!\nThat morning, during the run-through of the action scene...\nI saw Powers trip and fall!\nHe broke one of the props, it was a big mess.\nApparently, he sprained his ankle pretty bad.\nNow, look at that picture!\nYou can see he's dragging his leg! See? Clear as day!\nThat's how I knew it was Powers. Happy?Judge:\nHmm. So he had sprained his ankle...? Very well. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Phoenix:\n(She's got to be hiding something... I'll press her until she squeals.)Cross Examination-- The Man in the Photo --Oldbag:\nI never say anything I don't mean, mind you!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nOldbag:\nWhippersnapper!\nPhoenix:\n(Hey, I haven't said anything yet!)\nOldbag:\nI'll have you know I'm not pointing fingers at anyone behind their backs! Everything I've said is on the straight and narrow! The up and up! Youth today! Always whining about each other, pointing fingers this way and that! It's enough to make an old lady want to cry...\nEdgeworth:\nMr. Wright! Please, for all our sakes, try not to upset the witness!\nPhoenix:\n(I think Edgeworth has met his match...)Oldbag:\nThat morning, during the run-through of the action scene...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWho was present at the run-through?\nOldbag:\nWell, let's see... There was Powers, he's the Steel Samurai... Then poor old Hammer, the Evil Magistrate. And... me.\nJudge:\nAnd what exactly were you doing?\nOldbag:\nObserving! Just... observing.\nPhoenix:\nWhat about the assistant?\nOldbag:\nOh, she was off moving backdrops around and such.\nPhoenix:\n(So she didn't see the run-through, then...)Oldbag:\nI saw Powers trip and fall!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Trip and fall\"...?\nOldbag:\nYes! And to think, he's supposed to be the Steel Samurai! What a laugh! So Powers sprained his ankle. I helped make it better for him, of course.\nJudge:\nYou... helped make it better?\nOldbag:\nI kissed it where it hurt.\nJudge:\nL-let's just skip over that part, shall we?\nPhoenix:\nWhere was the assistant then?\nOldbag:\nOh, her? She was cleaning up backdrops, I think. She didn't know about Powers's ankle.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm...)\nEdgeworth:\nYou may continue your testimony.Oldbag:\nHe broke one of the props, it was a big mess.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe broke a prop?\nOldbag:\nSure did! His own Samurai Spear.\nPhoenix:\n(His Samurai Spear... the murder weapon!?)\nOldbag:\nLuckily I was there with my duct tape to fix it.\nPhoenix:\n(This strikes me as a significant detail... I'd better write this down in the Court Record.)\nSamurai Spear updated in the Court Record.Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe broke a prop?\nOldbag:\nSure did!

See? Clear as day!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely sure? (Let's take a look at that picture again... Hmm... so he was walking strangely because he was injured...)\nJudge:\nHmm. It does look like he was dragging his foot.\nOldbag:\nSee! And you didn't trust me! Whippersnapper!Oldbag:\nThat's how I knew it was Powers. Happy?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nStill, you can't look at this and say it's Mr. Powers!\nEdgeworth:\n\nEdgeworth:\nYes, but only Mr. Powers would have been dragging his leg!\nJudge:\nHe has a point. It does seem quite likely that it was Powers.\nPhoenix:\n(There's got to be more to this. I'd better keep pressing her.)Maya:\nWell, Nick? Find any glaring contradictions?Phoenix:\nWell, she seems pretty sure that was Powers in that photo... I guess I'll just press her and see if I can shake her conviction...After pressing second or third statement, then pressing fourth statement:Edgeworth:\nI think we've heard enough! Haven't we, Your Honor?Judge:\nWell, there is one thing that bothers me.Edgeworth:\nWhich is?Judge:\nWhere is this \"Steel Samurai\" costume now?Edgeworth:\nUmm... hmm. Actually, well... We couldn't find it. We're looking, though.Judge:\nHmm...Edgeworth:\nAnyway, that's not important! The witness did see the Steel Samurai, yes. And it is clear that the person in the Steel Samurai suit was Mr. Will Powers!Judge:\nHmm... I suppose that's right.Phoenix:\n(Are you sure you're sure, Your Honor?)Object\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHold it right there! We keep talking possibilities, but we have to agree that this photo shows the Steel Samurai! Nowhere in this photo can we see Mr. Will Powers!\nJudge:\nHmm... The defense has a point. I also wonder if someone else not caught on camera could have killed Mr. Hammer. We have to consider that possibility, also.\nEdgeworth:\nThen allow me to remove that doubt from your mind, Your Honor...\nLeads to:\n\"Will the witness continue her testimony, please?\"Wait and see what happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I think I'll wait and see where this goes.)\nJudge:\nI suppose, since there weren't any additional crew members at the studios that day... It's quite likely that it was the defendant inside that costume. I see no problem with this evidence.\nEdgeworth:\nMost perceptive, Your Honor!\nPhoenix:\n(He still doesn't seem that convinced to me... I hope.)\nLeads to:\n\"Will the witness continue her testimony, please?\"Edgeworth:\nWill the witness continue her testimony, please?Oldbag:\nNo need to ask twice!Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account, cont. --Oldbag:\nThe time of poor Hammer's death was 2:30 PM, true?\nThe only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers!\nNo one else went there!\nIf they had, I would have seen them!Judge:\nHmm... So, if no one else went to the studio... Then it would have to be this \"Steel Samurai\" who did it. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Cross Examination",

We have to consider that possibility, also.\nEdgeworth:\nThen allow me to remove that doubt from your mind, Your Honor...\nLeads to:\n\"Will the witness continue her testimony, please?\"Wait and see what happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I think I'll wait and see where this goes.)\nJudge:\nI suppose, since there weren't any additional crew members at the studios that day... It's quite likely that it was the defendant inside that costume. I see no problem with this evidence.\nEdgeworth:\nMost perceptive, Your Honor!\nPhoenix:\n(He still doesn't seem that convinced to me... I hope.)\nLeads to:\n\"Will the witness continue her testimony, please?\"Edgeworth:\nWill the witness continue her testimony, please?Oldbag:\nNo need to ask twice!Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account, cont. --Oldbag:\nThe time of poor Hammer's death was 2:30 PM, true?\nThe only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers!\nNo one else went there!\nIf they had, I would have seen them!Judge:\nHmm... So, if no one else went to the studio... Then it would have to be this \"Steel Samurai\" who did it. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Cross Examination",

Prosecutor von Karma!? You mean...?Phoenix:\nNo, I heard it's his successor this time...Maya:\nSuccessor...? ... Manfred von Karma... was a really sinister man. (Changed from [Manfred von Karma. He was a really sinister man.] in the original release) He pulled all sorts of nasty tricks; all so he could win.Phoenix:\n(He was a man obsessed with the word \"perfection\"... He had a perfect record... for forty long years. Who knows what sorts of dirty tricks he used to get each of those guilty verdicts? And now, his successor... I wonder what kind of person they will turn out to be...)Maya:\nIt's no good...Mystic Maya!!Maya:\nPearly! You showed up! Thanks for coming all this way!Pearl:\nI was really worried about you...Maya:\nHey, where's your mother? Didn't you two come together?Pearl:\nMother is watching over the trainees. She said they have training for two days straight with no breaks.Maya:\nHuh!? Then... Then... You came all by yourself?Pearl:\nYup! I snuck out of the manor and followed a map.Phoenix:\nDon't tell me you walked all the way here...Pearl:\nOf course not! ...I ran!Phoenix:\nThat's... I can't... Oh my... (If it takes two hours by train... Oh man...)Maya:\nPearly... What about the train?Pearl:\nHuh? What's a... \"tray-in\"?Phoenix:\n(I give up...)Pearl:\n...It's time, isn't it?Maya:\nUm... I'm really scared... What if Von Karma tries to do something to me? At least I know Mr. Edgeworth would be nicer to me than Von Karma!Pearl:\nMr. Eh-ji-werth? Who is that?Maya:\nUm, he's Nick's rival... Well, he's also a friend.Edgeworth:Maya:\nI still remember him as though I'd seen him only yesterday. (Changed from [I still remember him as if I had just seen him only yesterday.] in the original release)Phoenix:Maya:\nEvery trial was a scorchingly fierce battle until the very end. (Changed from [Every trial was a scorching fierce battle until the very end.] in the original release)Edgeworth:Phoenix:Maya:\nIt was always back and forth with them. But when you're rivals for life...Phoenix:\nMaya! Please don't mention that name ever again...Maya:\nHuh...? But why, Nick?Phoenix:\nI'm... I'm sorry, Maya. I forgot you don't know... He... He's... He's gone... And he's not coming back...Maya:\nWhaaaat!? W-W-Wait... Wait a second!! What's that supposed to mean!?Bailiff:\nCourt will commence shortly. Please proceed into the courtroom.Phoenix:\n... Let's go. Now's not the time to talk about that anyway.Maya:\nN...Nick...?June 21, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Maya Fey. Are the prosecution and the defense prepared????:\n...Phoenix:\n... (What is with this kid...?) (Changed from [... (What is with this girl...?)] in the original release)Judge:\n... *Ahem!* Mr. Wright!! Are you prepared!? (Changed from [*Ahem!* Mr. Wright!! Are you finally prepared!?] in the original release)Phoenix:\nHuh? A-Ah, yes, Your Honor. (Why does he always seem mad at me!?)???:\nMr. Phoenix Wright.Phoenix:\n...!???:\nYou must be a little shocked because I am a woman, correct?Phoenix:\n(...Hold on. So SHE'S the famed \"successor\" to Prosecutor von Karma...?) (Changed from [...Hold on. So this kid is the \"famed\" Prosecutor von Karma...?] in the original release)von Karma:\nI am Franziska von Karma, the Prodigy.Phoenix:\nI... see...von Karma:\nI gave up a promising career in Germany and came to this country for one sole reason. Revenge.Phoenix:\nRevenge...? (Is this about her father, Manfred von Karma...?)Judge:\nUm... If it's something of a personal nature, I'm sure you can... Oww!von Karma:\nI'm talking. If you interrupt again, my whip will do the speaking for me.Phoenix:\n(Please speak with your mouth like a normal person... I beg of you...) Yeow!!von Karma:\nMake no mistake; I will defeat you! Prepare to go down, Mr. Phoenix Wright!Judge:\nProsecutor von Karma, your opening statement, please...von Karma:\nThose of Von Karma blood have only one fate. And that is \"perfection\". The defendant, Maya Fey, will find no escape from her guilt on my watch.Judge:\nV-Very well... What is the defense's position?Phoenix:\nYour Honor.Judge:\nDoes the defense wish to enter a plea of \"not guilty\"?Phoenix:\n...Yes.von Karma:\nFoolish fool who foolishly dreams of foolish dreams... Ten minutes. I give the defense ten minutes before it changes its plea. That's right. I'll have you running for the \"justified self-defense\" plea in no time.Phoenix:\n(\"Justified self-defense\"... A plea usually reserved for when a person unintentionally kills in defense of themself. (Changed from [A plea usually reserved for when a person unintentionally kills in defense of himself.] in the original release) We could very easily make a solid case that it was self-defense, but...) The defense stands by the plea of \"not guilty\", Your Honor! (Because to plead \"justified self-defense\" is to say you did kill someone.)von Karma:\nHow foolish. If that's how you want to play it, Mr. Phoenix Wright, then I shall now call the first witness.Phoenix:\n(She's just as scary as her father. Like father, like daughter I suppose.)von Karma:\nWitness, your name and occupation?Gumshoe:\nYes, sir! My name is Dick Gumshoe. I'm a detective at the local precinct. Aah!!von Karma:\nGet to the point already. Explain to the court the details of this murder.Gumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir! Um, if everyone would please look at this map. The Channeling Chamber has no windows and the door was locked shut. At the time of the murder, only the victim and the defendant were in the room.Judge:\nWhat were they doing in there?Gumshoe:\nUm... They... Well, they were channeling... a spirit... Sir.Judge:\nCh-Channeling a spirit??Phoenix:\n(That's quite the look of disbelief there, Your Honor...) (Changed from [The look of disbelief on the judge's face is...] in the original release)Gumshoe:\n*ahem* Anyway, a few minutes after the channeling started, gunshots were heard coming from inside the room, sir. A few of the witnesses broke the door down, and rushed into the room.Judge:\nAh, and that's when they found that the victim was already dead, correct? Hmm, I believe this is one of the most open and shut cases I have ever presided over.Floor Plans added to the Court Record.Judge:\nSo, how was the victim killed?Gumshoe:\nI was about to get to that...von Karma:\nStop wasting my time, then.Witness Testimony-- Cause of Death --Gumshoe:\nThe direct cause of death was a pistol shot to the forehead, sir.\nThe shot was fired from point-blank range.\nBut before the victim was shot, sir, he was stabbed in the chest.\nThe wound was very severe, but not enough to cause instantaneous death.\nThe murderer used the pistol to finish the victim off after the stabbing.Judge:\nHmm... So the victim was stabbed before being shot...Gumshoe:\nThis is the victim's autopsy report, sir.Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.Judge:\nThe court accepts it into evidence. Mr. Wright, you may question the witness.Cross Examination-- Cause of Death --Gumshoe:\nThe direct cause of death was a pistol shot to the forehead, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe murder weapon, Detective Gumshoe. Whose pistol was it?\nGumshoe:\nIt was the victim's.\nPhoenix:\nThe victim? Now, why would he have...\nvon Karma:\n\nvon Karma:\n\"Why would he have a pistol?\" Who cares? The point that you are missing is whose fingerprints are on that pistol. If you're not already paying attention to that, then I suggest you start.\nJudge:\nFingerprints? There were fingerprints?\nGumshoe:\nAlong with the victim's, the defendant, Maya Fey's were also on the grip, sir.\nJudge:\nHmm. So the defendant's fingerprints were left on the murder weapon...\nPhoenix:\n(Argh...! I walked right into her hands there.) (Changed from [Hmm... I walked right into her hands there.] in the original release)Gumshoe:\nThe shot was fired from point-blank range.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nPoint blank, huh? So about how far away was it?\nGumshoe:\nIt was anywhere between 12 to 20 inches away.\nPhoenix:\nAnd how do you know he was shot at point blank?\nvon Karma:\nTsk, tsk, tsk. Mr. Phoenix Wright. I grow tired of the foolish foolery of the foolish fools of this foolish country...\nPhoenix:\nE-Excuse me!?\nvon Karma:\nGunpowder burn.\nPhoenix:\n...Gunpowder burn?\nvon Karma:\nWhen something is shot from point blank, a burn area is left around the bullet hole.\nGumshoe:\nGunpowder exploding is what makes a bullet fire, and that gets real hot, pal. And there were definitely some gunpowder burns left on the victim's forehead!\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... Never knew that... Live and learn, I guess...)Gumshoe:\nBut before the victim was shot, sir, he was stabbed in the chest.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nStabbed... And what was he stabbed with?\nGumshoe:\nA fruit knife.\nJudge:\nI see. And whose knife was it?\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like it belongs to the Feys, sir. And of course, Maya Fey's fingerprints are all over it.\nJudge:\nHmm... All over it, huh?\nPhoenix:\n(Urk. This does not look good...)\nvon Karma:\nHa ha ha. What will you do now, Mr. Phoenix Wright?Gumshoe:\nThe wound was very severe, but not enough to cause instantaneous death.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow severe was the wound?\nGumshoe:\nIf it had been half an inch more to the right, it would've hit the victim's heart. After a stab like that, it's impossible to fight back, let alone stand.\nPhoenix:\n(This testimony makes Maya look like she had stabbed him with the intent to kill...)Gumshoe:\nThe murderer used the pistol to finish the victim off after the stabbing.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure he was stabbed first, then shot?\nGumshoe:\nYup. Sure as sure can be. One look at the wounds and you'd come to the same conclusion too, pal.\nvon Karma:\nA fool is a fool who will only listen to the foolish opinions of other foolish fools... A pistol shot to the forehead at point blank is certainly enough to kill instantly. Does it matter, then, which was first? Think a little more before you open that big mouth of yours, Mr. Phoenix Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(Grr... What a pain...)Phoenix:\n(Nothing sounds out of place so far... I should try to learn more about the murder weapons, for now...)After pressing first, second, third and fifth statements:Judge:\nThat's enough! We have clearly established how the victim was murdered.Gumshoe:\nI brought the two murder weapons with me today.Judge:\nVery well. The court accepts them into evidence.Pistol added to the Court Record.Knife added to the Court Record.von Karma:\nThe date and time of death was June 19th at 3:15 PM. Eyewitnesses claim to have heard two gunshots at this time.Judge:\nAnd two murder weapons, both with the defendant's fingerprints on them, huh... (Changed from [And the two murder weapons, both with the defendant's fingerprints on them...?] in the original release) Hmm... This does seem like an open and shut case.von Karma:\nNaturally!Phoenix:\n(This is going from bad to worse... As if the summary just now wasn't oversimplifying things to the extreme...)von Karma:\nYour Honor. Feel free to slam that little gavel of yours. After all, there is no room left for doubt, is there?Judge:\nThat is quite true... Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nY-Yes?Judge:\nEven in the face of all this, do you still wish to plead \"not guilty\"? It's the opinion of this court that if you do not adjust your plea, you stand to lose.von Karma:\nSee, just as I promised, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You would change your plea in less than ten minutes...Judge:\nWhat will you do, Mr. Wright? Will you change to \"justified self-defense\"? Because now would be the time to do so. This is your final chance.Phoenix:\n(This is a huge decision! I'd better think this through all the way!)Plead justified self-defense\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If Maya is convicted, then it's all over. I really should play it safe, and try to soften the blow...) Your Honor. The defense would like to change its plea to \"justified self-defense\"...\nvon Karma:\nHah.\nJudge:\nUnderstood. Let the record show that the defense has entered a new plea.\nPhoenix:\n(...There's nothing else I could do... Mia...?)\nMia:\n...You already hold the key... ...If you don't believe, you cannot win...\nPhoenix:\n(...! If we plead \"justified self-defense\", we would basically be confessing to murder! After the trial, Maya's life would be destroyed, and she'll be labeled a murderer... Can I really... Can I really let that happen!?) Your Honor!\nJudge:\nY-Yes?\nPhoenix:\nThe defense... The defense retracts its previous statement. And instead, will prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that the defendant is not guilty!\nLeads to:\n\"...You.\"Plead not guilty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If we plead \"justified self-defense\"... we would basically be confessing to a murder! After the trial, Maya's life would be destroyed, and she'd be labeled a murderer... I can't let that happen!) Your Honor!\nJudge:\nHave you reached a conclusion, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nThe defense will not change its plea. We will accept nothing short of complete acquittal!\nLeads to:\n\"...You.\"von Karma:\n...You. You have sealed your fate, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Detective!Gumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir!von Karma:\nPresent the final portion of your testimony -- the final strike.Gumshoe:\nUm... Y-Yes... sir...Judge:\nN-Now, see here! Proceedings are run by... Eek!von Karma:\n...Judge:\nOh, yes, of course. Go ahead Detective and give your testimony...von Karma:\nI think the court would like to hear about the other piece of incriminating evidence!Witness Testimony-- Incriminating Evidence --Gumshoe:\nSorry, pal, but there's an even more incriminating piece of evidence.\nThis is the costume the defendant was wearing at the time of the crime.\nAs you can see, it's covered in blood.\nThe defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back.Judge:\nSo this is the costume... There certainly is evidence of a back spray of blood on this.Gumshoe:\nThis piece directly links Maya Fey to the crime, sir.Judge:\nI see... The court accepts this into evidence.Maya's Costume added to the Court Record.Judge:\nAlright, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\n(Maya's fingerprints on both murder weapons and blood splatters on her clothes... Could this situation get any worse??)von Karma:\nHah. What's wrong? You seem to be at a loss. I think this is the last piece of testimony the prosecution should have to offer. Feel free to sulk off with your tail between your legs, Mr. Phoenix Wright!Phoenix:\n(Please stop calling me by my full name. It's disturbing.)Cross Examination",

One of the women was not able to escape the flaming wreckage and died at the site. Ongoing investigation has revealed that the driver had fallen asleep at the wheel. -Ms. Ini Miney Holds Interview About Crash- I was like, really tired and I dropped off to sleep. Then there was this crash, and like, I woke up in a huge sea of flames. I was like, still half-asleep, but I opened the right door and like, got out. I don't, like, remember anything else. -Doctor Lurking in the Shadows? If Ms. Ini Miney is to be believed, the one driving the car was her sister, Mimi Miney. Mimi Miney was the nurse at Grey Surgical Clinic where 14 patients were accidentally overdosed to their death. Is this then, just a mere coincidence...? "

Prosecutor von Karma!? You mean...?Phoenix:\nNo, I heard it's his successor this time...Maya:\nSuccessor...? ... Manfred von Karma... was a really sinister man. (Changed from [Manfred von Karma. He was a really sinister man.] in the original release) He pulled all sorts of nasty tricks; all so he could win.Phoenix:\n(He was a man obsessed with the word \"perfection\"... He had a perfect record... for forty long years. Who knows what sorts of dirty tricks he used to get each of those guilty verdicts? And now, his successor... I wonder what kind of person they will turn out to be...)Maya:\nIt's no good...Mystic Maya!!Maya:\nPearly! You showed up! Thanks for coming all this way!Pearl:\nI was really worried about you...Maya:\nHey, where's your mother? Didn't you two come together?Pearl:\nMother is watching over the trainees. She said they have training for two days straight with no breaks.Maya:\nHuh!? Then... Then... You came all by yourself?Pearl:\nYup! I snuck out of the manor and followed a map.Phoenix:\nDon't tell me you walked all the way here...Pearl:\nOf course not! ...I ran!Phoenix:\nThat's... I can't... Oh my... (If it takes two hours by train... Oh man...)Maya:\nPearly... What about the train?Pearl:\nHuh? What's a... \"tray-in\"?Phoenix:\n(I give up...)Pearl:\n...It's time, isn't it?Maya:\nUm... I'm really scared... What if Von Karma tries to do something to me? At least I know Mr. Edgeworth would be nicer to me than Von Karma!Pearl:\nMr. Eh-ji-werth? Who is that?Maya:\nUm, he's Nick's rival... Well, he's also a friend.Edgeworth:Maya:\nI still remember him as though I'd seen him only yesterday. (Changed from [I still remember him as if I had just seen him only yesterday.] in the original release)Phoenix:Maya:\nEvery trial was a scorchingly fierce battle until the very end. (Changed from [Every trial was a scorching fierce battle until the very end.] in the original release)Edgeworth:Phoenix:Maya:\nIt was always back and forth with them. But when you're rivals for life...Phoenix:\nMaya! Please don't mention that name ever again...Maya:\nHuh...? But why, Nick?Phoenix:\nI'm... I'm sorry, Maya. I forgot you don't know... He... He's... He's gone... And he's not coming back...Maya:\nWhaaaat!? W-W-Wait... Wait a second!! What's that supposed to mean!?Bailiff:\nCourt will commence shortly. Please proceed into the courtroom.Phoenix:\n... Let's go. Now's not the time to talk about that anyway.Maya:\nN...Nick...?June 21, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Maya Fey. Are the prosecution and the defense prepared????:\n...Phoenix:\n... (What is with this kid...?) (Changed from [... (What is with this girl...?)] in the original release)Judge:\n... *Ahem!* Mr. Wright!! Are you prepared!? (Changed from [*Ahem!* Mr. Wright!! Are you finally prepared!?] in the original release)Phoenix:\nHuh? A-Ah, yes, Your Honor. (Why does he always seem mad at me!?)???:\nMr. Phoenix Wright.Phoenix:\n...!???:\nYou must be a little shocked because I am a woman, correct?Phoenix:\n(...Hold on. So SHE'S the famed \"successor\" to Prosecutor von Karma...?) (Changed from [...Hold on. So this kid is the \"famed\" Prosecutor von Karma...?] in the original release)von Karma:\nI am Franziska von Karma, the Prodigy.Phoenix:\nI... see...von Karma:\nI gave up a promising career in Germany and came to this country for one sole reason. Revenge.Phoenix:\nRevenge...? (Is this about her father, Manfred von Karma...?)Judge:\nUm... If it's something of a personal nature, I'm sure you can... Oww!von Karma:\nI'm talking. If you interrupt again, my whip will do the speaking for me.Phoenix:\n(Please speak with your mouth like a normal person... I beg of you...) Yeow!!von Karma:\nMake no mistake; I will defeat you! Prepare to go down, Mr. Phoenix Wright!Judge:\nProsecutor von Karma, your opening statement, please...von Karma:\nThose of Von Karma blood have only one fate. And that is \"perfection\". The defendant, Maya Fey, will find no escape from her guilt on my watch.Judge:\nV-Very well... What is the defense's position?Phoenix:\nYour Honor.Judge:\nDoes the defense wish to enter a plea of \"not guilty\"?Phoenix:\n...Yes.von Karma:\nFoolish fool who foolishly dreams of foolish dreams... Ten minutes. I give the defense ten minutes before it changes its plea. That's right. I'll have you running for the \"justified self-defense\" plea in no time.Phoenix:\n(\"Justified self-defense\"... A plea usually reserved for when a person unintentionally kills in defense of themself. (Changed from [A plea usually reserved for when a person unintentionally kills in defense of himself.] in the original release) We could very easily make a solid case that it was self-defense, but...) The defense stands by the plea of \"not guilty\", Your Honor! (Because to plead \"justified self-defense\" is to say you did kill someone.)von Karma:\nHow foolish. If that's how you want to play it, Mr. Phoenix Wright, then I shall now call the first witness.Phoenix:\n(She's just as scary as her father. Like father, like daughter I suppose.)von Karma:\nWitness, your name and occupation?Gumshoe:\nYes, sir! My name is Dick Gumshoe. I'm a detective at the local precinct. Aah!!von Karma:\nGet to the point already. Explain to the court the details of this murder.Gumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir! Um, if everyone would please look at this map. The Channeling Chamber has no windows and the door was locked shut. At the time of the murder, only the victim and the defendant were in the room.Judge:\nWhat were they doing in there?Gumshoe:\nUm... They... Well, they were channeling... a spirit... Sir.Judge:\nCh-Channeling a spirit??Phoenix:\n(That's quite the look of disbelief there, Your Honor...) (Changed from [The look of disbelief on the judge's face is...] in the original release)Gumshoe:\n*ahem* Anyway, a few minutes after the channeling started, gunshots were heard coming from inside the room, sir. A few of the witnesses broke the door down, and rushed into the room.Judge:\nAh, and that's when they found that the victim was already dead, correct? Hmm, I believe this is one of the most open and shut cases I have ever presided over.Floor Plans added to the Court Record.Judge:\nSo, how was the victim killed?Gumshoe:\nI was about to get to that...von Karma:\nStop wasting my time, then.Witness Testimony-- Cause of Death --Gumshoe:\nThe direct cause of death was a pistol shot to the forehead, sir.\nThe shot was fired from point-blank range.\nBut before the victim was shot, sir, he was stabbed in the chest.\nThe wound was very severe, but not enough to cause instantaneous death.\nThe murderer used the pistol to finish the victim off after the stabbing.Judge:\nHmm... So the victim was stabbed before being shot...Gumshoe:\nThis is the victim's autopsy report, sir.Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.Judge:\nThe court accepts it into evidence. Mr. Wright, you may question the witness.Cross Examination-- Cause of Death --Gumshoe:\nThe direct cause of death was a pistol shot to the forehead, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe murder weapon, Detective Gumshoe. Whose pistol was it?\nGumshoe:\nIt was the victim's.\nPhoenix:\nThe victim? Now, why would he have...\nvon Karma:\n\nvon Karma:\n\"Why would he have a pistol?\" Who cares? The point that you are missing is whose fingerprints are on that pistol. If you're not already paying attention to that, then I suggest you start.\nJudge:\nFingerprints? There were fingerprints?\nGumshoe:\nAlong with the victim's, the defendant, Maya Fey's were also on the grip, sir.\nJudge:\nHmm. So the defendant's fingerprints were left on the murder weapon...\nPhoenix:\n(Argh...! I walked right into her hands there.) (Changed from [Hmm... I walked right into her hands there.] in the original release)Gumshoe:\nThe shot was fired from point-blank range.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nPoint blank, huh? So about how far away was it?\nGumshoe:\nIt was anywhere between 12 to 20 inches away.\nPhoenix:\nAnd how do you know he was shot at point blank?\nvon Karma:\nTsk, tsk, tsk. Mr. Phoenix Wright. I grow tired of the foolish foolery of the foolish fools of this foolish country...\nPhoenix:\nE-Excuse me!?\nvon Karma:\nGunpowder burn.\nPhoenix:\n...Gunpowder burn?\nvon Karma:\nWhen something is shot from point blank, a burn area is left around the bullet hole.\nGumshoe:\nGunpowder exploding is what makes a bullet fire, and that gets real hot, pal. And there were definitely some gunpowder burns left on the victim's forehead!\nPhoenix:\n(Wow... Never knew that... Live and learn, I guess...)Gumshoe:\nBut before the victim was shot, sir, he was stabbed in the chest.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nStabbed... And what was he stabbed with?\nGumshoe:\nA fruit knife.\nJudge:\nI see. And whose knife was it?\nGumshoe:\nIt looks like it belongs to the Feys, sir. And of course, Maya Fey's fingerprints are all over it.\nJudge:\nHmm... All over it, huh?\nPhoenix:\n(Urk. This does not look good...)\nvon Karma:\nHa ha ha. What will you do now, Mr. Phoenix Wright?Gumshoe:\nThe wound was very severe, but not enough to cause instantaneous death.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow severe was the wound?\nGumshoe:\nIf it had been half an inch more to the right, it would've hit the victim's heart. After a stab like that, it's impossible to fight back, let alone stand.\nPhoenix:\n(This testimony makes Maya look like she had stabbed him with the intent to kill...)Gumshoe:\nThe murderer used the pistol to finish the victim off after the stabbing.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure he was stabbed first, then shot?\nGumshoe:\nYup. Sure as sure can be. One look at the wounds and you'd come to the same conclusion too, pal.\nvon Karma:\nA fool is a fool who will only listen to the foolish opinions of other foolish fools... A pistol shot to the forehead at point blank is certainly enough to kill instantly. Does it matter, then, which was first? Think a little more before you open that big mouth of yours, Mr. Phoenix Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(Grr... What a pain...)Phoenix:\n(Nothing sounds out of place so far... I should try to learn more about the murder weapons, for now...)After pressing first, second, third and fifth statements:Judge:\nThat's enough! We have clearly established how the victim was murdered.Gumshoe:\nI brought the two murder weapons with me today.Judge:\nVery well. The court accepts them into evidence.Pistol added to the Court Record.Knife added to the Court Record.von Karma:\nThe date and time of death was June 19th at 3:15 PM. Eyewitnesses claim to have heard two gunshots at this time.Judge:\nAnd two murder weapons, both with the defendant's fingerprints on them, huh... (Changed from [And the two murder weapons, both with the defendant's fingerprints on them...?] in the original release) Hmm... This does seem like an open and shut case.von Karma:\nNaturally!Phoenix:\n(This is going from bad to worse... As if the summary just now wasn't oversimplifying things to the extreme...)von Karma:\nYour Honor. Feel free to slam that little gavel of yours. After all, there is no room left for doubt, is there?Judge:\nThat is quite true... Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nY-Yes?Judge:\nEven in the face of all this, do you still wish to plead \"not guilty\"? It's the opinion of this court that if you do not adjust your plea, you stand to lose.von Karma:\nSee, just as I promised, Mr. Phoenix Wright. You would change your plea in less than ten minutes...Judge:\nWhat will you do, Mr. Wright? Will you change to \"justified self-defense\"? Because now would be the time to do so. This is your final chance.Phoenix:\n(This is a huge decision! I'd better think this through all the way!)Plead justified self-defense\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If Maya is convicted, then it's all over. I really should play it safe, and try to soften the blow...) Your Honor. The defense would like to change its plea to \"justified self-defense\"...\nvon Karma:\nHah.\nJudge:\nUnderstood. Let the record show that the defense has entered a new plea.\nPhoenix:\n(...There's nothing else I could do... Mia...?)\nMia:\n...You already hold the key... ...If you don't believe, you cannot win...\nPhoenix:\n(...! If we plead \"justified self-defense\", we would basically be confessing to murder! After the trial, Maya's life would be destroyed, and she'll be labeled a murderer... Can I really... Can I really let that happen!?) Your Honor!\nJudge:\nY-Yes?\nPhoenix:\nThe defense... The defense retracts its previous statement. And instead, will prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that the defendant is not guilty!\nLeads to:\n\"...You.\"Plead not guilty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If we plead \"justified self-defense\"... we would basically be confessing to a murder! After the trial, Maya's life would be destroyed, and she'd be labeled a murderer... I can't let that happen!) Your Honor!\nJudge:\nHave you reached a conclusion, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nThe defense will not change its plea. We will accept nothing short of complete acquittal!\nLeads to:\n\"...You.\"von Karma:\n...You. You have sealed your fate, Mr. Phoenix Wright. Detective!Gumshoe:\nY-Yes, sir!von Karma:\nPresent the final portion of your testimony -- the final strike.Gumshoe:\nUm... Y-Yes... sir...Judge:\nN-Now, see here! Proceedings are run by... Eek!von Karma:\n...Judge:\nOh, yes, of course. Go ahead Detective and give your testimony...von Karma:\nI think the court would like to hear about the other piece of incriminating evidence!Witness Testimony-- Incriminating Evidence --Gumshoe:\nSorry, pal, but there's an even more incriminating piece of evidence.\nThis is the costume the defendant was wearing at the time of the crime.\nAs you can see, it's covered in blood.\nThe defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back.Judge:\nSo this is the costume... There certainly is evidence of a back spray of blood on this.Gumshoe:\nThis piece directly links Maya Fey to the crime, sir.Judge:\nI see... The court accepts this into evidence.Maya's Costume added to the Court Record.Judge:\nAlright, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\n(Maya's fingerprints on both murder weapons and blood splatters on her clothes... Could this situation get any worse??)von Karma:\nHah. What's wrong? You seem to be at a loss. I think this is the last piece of testimony the prosecution should have to offer.

You're kinda scary today, you know, pal?\nJudge:\nCome now, Mr. Wright... There is no need for that kind of attitude in my court...\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\nA-Alright. Just, please stop glaring at me like that...Gumshoe:\nThis is the costume the defendant was wearing at the time of the crime.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nMaya's... costume?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. She was wearing this when we arrested her.\nPhoenix:\n(Maya... She's wearing her channeling costume today too... Is she not allowed to wear anything else...?)Gumshoe:\nAs you can see, it's covered in blood.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThis blood on the costume...\nGumshoe:\nLab results show that it is the victim's blood.\nJudge:\nHmm...

(Changed from [Hmm, where there any other clues you could gleam [sic] from this piece of evidence?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nUm, well...\nvon Karma:\n\nvon Karma:\nIf you must change the topic, then the good detective here must testify again. But too bad. Not enough time. Let's move on. (Changed from [But too bad. Not enough time.

I wonder about that too...\nJudge:\nThat last antic of yours just pushed me over the top, Mr. Wright. I hereby declare this cross-examination over...

Focus, Phoenix!)\nLeads back to:\n\"The problem I have with this piece of evidence is here!\"\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI ask the court to please take a look at the sleeve of this costume.\nJudge:\nThe sleeve? ...!

No one ever told me!\nJudge:\nA hole that smells of gunpowder...\nPhoenix:\n(It looks like I've found the \"hole\" I was looking for!)

This is a huge oversight!\nJudge:\nWhile I agree it is a mistake on the part of the police, what Prosecutor von Karma has said is true. The evidence still stands.

The content is as follows-Highway of Nightmares-May 24 - Late last night, two women's car crashed into a highway center divide. One of the women was not able to escape the flaming wreckage and died at the site. Ongoing investigation has revealed that the driver had fallen asleep at the wheel. -Ms. Ini Miney Holds Interview About Crash- I was like, really tired and I dropped off to sleep. Then there was this crash, and like, I woke up in a huge sea of flames. I was like, still half-asleep, but I opened the right door and like, got out. I don't, like, remember anything else. -Doctor Lurking in the Shadows? If Ms. Ini Miney is to be believed, the one driving the car was her sister, Mimi Miney. Mimi Miney was the nurse at Grey Surgical Clinic where 14 patients were accidentally overdosed to their death. Is this then, just a mere coincidence...? "

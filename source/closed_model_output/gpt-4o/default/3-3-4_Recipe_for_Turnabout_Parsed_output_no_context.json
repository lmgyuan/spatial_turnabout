Yesterday's session didn't go so well, and then ended on a giant mystery.Phoenix:\n(That's true... And we still haven't solved a single part of it yet...)Maya:\nAre you OK, Nick?Phoenix:\nHuh? Oh, uh... Yeah. Of course.Byrde:\nI saw that! That little flash of doubt in your eyes!Phoenix:\nN-No! That wasn't doubt. That was, umm... determination!Byrde:\nWhy don't I believe you...?Maya:\nIt's nearly time, Maggey. You'd better get going to the defendant's seat.Byrde:\nRoger. Don't let me down, Mr. Wright. I'm counting on you!Hey, pal!Phoenix:\nHey, Detective Gumshoe...Gumshoe:\nQuit stressing Maggey out! She doesn't need that!Phoenix:\nH-How did you know she was stressed...?Gumshoe:\nI was watching through the doorway.Phoenix:\nOh...Gumshoe:\nYou look like you lost the case already. Show a bit of confidence, will you, pal!? Here, maybe this'll help.Maya:\nHuh!? Have you taken up aromatherapy, too?Gumshoe:\nNot in a million years, pal! Don't tell me that you don't remember this thing?Phoenix:\n(Hmm... Come to think of it, that doesn't look like one of those aromatherapy bottles...)Gumshoe:\nThis is the small bottle that turned up in Tr\u00e9s Bien's kitchen a couple of days ago.Maya:\nWow! Look at all these little bottles!Phoenix:\nOh! They're aromatherapy oils! He's got so many, they're overflowing onto the floor...Maya:\nHey, wait a minute... There's one bottle that's different from all the others.Phoenix:\nWell what do you know. And it doesn't have a label either.Maya:\nAnd... *sniff* It doesn't smell.Gumshoe:\nWe finally got the analysis results back from the lab.Maya:\nSo!? What is it? Is it the poison?Gumshoe:\nI'm afraid not, pal. It's... medication.Maya:\nMedication?Gumshoe:\nYeah. For ears. Topical use only, apparently.Phoenix:\nFor ears? You mean...?Gumshoe:\nYeah. It's the medication Glen Elg was using for his ruptured eardrum!Phoenix:\n(What was Glen Elg's ear medicine doing in the kitchen...?)Small Bottle refiled into the Court Record.Phoenix:\nUm, what about the unidentified fingerprints? Anything on that?Gumshoe:\nSomeone screwed up, so they only had time to analyze the contents of the bottle. Another hour and they might have gotten something on the prints, but...Phoenix:\n(Hmm... That's going to weaken its impact as a piece of evidence...)Gumshoe:\nOK, pal! This is it! Make sure your defense is impregnable today, got it!?Phoenix:\n(Today's trial... I'm gonna expose that guy for what he's done, or my name isn't Phoenix Wright!)January 8, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Maggey Byrde.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Godot:\nReady and waiting as always, Your Honor.Judge:\nVery good. Then we'll get underway at once. Yesterday we heard the testimony of Mr. Victor Kudo. He claims to have witnessed the defendant putting a powder into the victim's coffee. However, the witness's testimony was plagued with a number of problems.Godot:\nThe mark on the rim of the cup shows that the victim drank from it with his right hand. But according to the old man's testimony, he picked it up with his left hand.Judge:\nThank you, Mr. Godot. Furthermore, according to the witness's account... ...the victim was listening to the radio with an earpiece in his left ear. Yet, the victim's left eardrum was ruptured, which made him effectively deaf in that ear.Maya:\nIt's amazing how many contradictions a single case can have, huh Nick?Godot:\nHa...! Allow me to enlighten you, Your Honor. The world, you see, keeps turning, and we must turn with it.Judge:\n... You've lost me already, Mr. Godot.Godot:\nDon't let the mysteries of yesterday mystify you today. Only losers think like that. You've got to change with the times! That's one of my rules!Judge:\nAre you implying that you've resolved these contradictions? You know the answers to these riddles!?Godot:\nThe old guy wasn't just throwing seed in here. He was throwing us off the scent. And today I'll prove it.Judge:\nVery well. Let the first witness take the stand!Godot:\nAnd you are?Armstrong:\nOh bonjour, everyone! I am Jean Armstrong. z'e owner and 'ead chef of la Tr\u00e9s Bien restaurant. Enchant\u00e9!.........Judge:\nForgive me for asking, witness, but... are you a woman?Armstrong:\nOh l\u00e0 l\u00e0, monsieur! As you can see, I am la pert and perky gentleman, non?Judge:\nEr... Umm...Godot:\nOn the day of the incident, you were in Tr\u00e9s Bien's kitchen. Isn't that right?Armstrong:\nW'iz you monsieur...Godot:\n...?Armstrong:\n...everything feels right!Godot:\nHa...!Phoenix:\n(Wow, he's totally unfazed! Doesn't anything intimidate this guy...?)Judge:\nVery well. Your testimony please, witness. Please tell the court what happened that day at Tr\u00e9s Bien.Armstrong:\nOui! Volontiers!Witness Testimony-- At Tr\u00e9s Bien --Armstrong:\nWhen it all 'appened, z'ere were just two customers in my restaurant.\nI remember I was experimenting w'iz some new art deco z'at day.\nLike 'aving a large mirror between la tables, for example.\nOui! Per'aps z'at is what la old man was looking at.\nLa cup, la earpiece, and la glasses... 'E would 'ave seen everyz'ing in reverse, non?Phoenix:\nA m...m...m... MIRROR!?Armstrong:\nOui! Un grand mirror! La most enormous mirror!Godot:\nAnd suddenly, the mystery disappears! Like I said, the world keeps turning, so roll with it!Judge:\nHmm... That would explain the coffee cup and the earpiece conundrum... The mirror would have made everything appear back to front.Phoenix:\n(What the heck!? It's way too early in the morning for this to be happening to me!)Judge:\nNow then, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.Cross Examination",

Yesterday's session didn't go so well, and then ended on a giant mystery.Phoenix:\n(That's true... And we still haven't solved a single part of it yet...)Maya:\nAre you OK, Nick?Phoenix:\nHuh? Oh, uh... Yeah. Of course.Byrde:\nI saw that! That little flash of doubt in your eyes!Phoenix:\nN-No! That wasn't doubt. That was, umm... determination!Byrde:\nWhy don't I believe you...?Maya:\nIt's nearly time, Maggey. You'd better get going to the defendant's seat.Byrde:\nRoger. Don't let me down, Mr. Wright. I'm counting on you!Hey, pal!Phoenix:\nHey, Detective Gumshoe...Gumshoe:\nQuit stressing Maggey out! She doesn't need that!Phoenix:\nH-How did you know she was stressed...?Gumshoe:\nI was watching through the doorway.Phoenix:\nOh...Gumshoe:\nYou look like you lost the case already. Show a bit of confidence, will you, pal!? Here, maybe this'll help.Maya:\nHuh!? Have you taken up aromatherapy, too?Gumshoe:\nNot in a million years, pal! Don't tell me that you don't remember this thing?Phoenix:\n(Hmm... Come to think of it, that doesn't look like one of those aromatherapy bottles...)Gumshoe:\nThis is the small bottle that turned up in Tr\u00e9s Bien's kitchen a couple of days ago.Maya:\nWow! Look at all these little bottles!Phoenix:\nOh! They're aromatherapy oils! He's got so many, they're overflowing onto the floor...Maya:\nHey, wait a minute... There's one bottle that's different from all the others.Phoenix:\nWell what do you know. And it doesn't have a label either.Maya:\nAnd... *sniff* It doesn't smell.Gumshoe:\nWe finally got the analysis results back from the lab.Maya:\nSo!? What is it? Is it the poison?Gumshoe:\nI'm afraid not, pal. It's... medication.Maya:\nMedication?Gumshoe:\nYeah. For ears. Topical use only, apparently.Phoenix:\nFor ears? You mean...?Gumshoe:\nYeah. It's the medication Glen Elg was using for his ruptured eardrum!Phoenix:\n(What was Glen Elg's ear medicine doing in the kitchen...?)Small Bottle refiled into the Court Record.Phoenix:\nUm, what about the unidentified fingerprints? Anything on that?Gumshoe:\nSomeone screwed up, so they only had time to analyze the contents of the bottle. Another hour and they might have gotten something on the prints, but...Phoenix:\n(Hmm... That's going to weaken its impact as a piece of evidence...)Gumshoe:\nOK, pal! This is it! Make sure your defense is impregnable today, got it!?Phoenix:\n(Today's trial... I'm gonna expose that guy for what he's done, or my name isn't Phoenix Wright!)January 8, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Maggey Byrde.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Godot:\nReady and waiting as always, Your Honor.Judge:\nVery good. Then we'll get underway at once. Yesterday we heard the testimony of Mr. Victor Kudo. He claims to have witnessed the defendant putting a powder into the victim's coffee. However, the witness's testimony was plagued with a number of problems.Godot:\nThe mark on the rim of the cup shows that the victim drank from it with his right hand. But according to the old man's testimony, he picked it up with his left hand.Judge:\nThank you, Mr. Godot. Furthermore, according to the witness's account... ...the victim was listening to the radio with an earpiece in his left ear. Yet, the victim's left eardrum was ruptured, which made him effectively deaf in that ear.Maya:\nIt's amazing how many contradictions a single case can have, huh Nick?Godot:\nHa...! Allow me to enlighten you, Your Honor. The world, you see, keeps turning, and we must turn with it.Judge:\n... You've lost me already, Mr. Godot.Godot:\nDon't let the mysteries of yesterday mystify you today. Only losers think like that. You've got to change with the times! That's one of my rules!Judge:\nAre you implying that you've resolved these contradictions? You know the answers to these riddles!?Godot:\nThe old guy wasn't just throwing seed in here. He was throwing us off the scent. And today I'll prove it.Judge:\nVery well. Let the first witness take the stand!Godot:\nAnd you are?Armstrong:\nOh bonjour, everyone! I am Jean Armstrong. z'e owner and 'ead chef of la Tr\u00e9s Bien restaurant. Enchant\u00e9!.........Judge:\nForgive me for asking, witness, but... are you a woman?Armstrong:\nOh l\u00e0 l\u00e0, monsieur! As you can see, I am la pert and perky gentleman, non?Judge:\nEr... Umm...Godot:\nOn the day of the incident, you were in Tr\u00e9s Bien's kitchen. Isn't that right?Armstrong:\nW'iz you monsieur...Godot:\n...?Armstrong:\n...everything feels right!Godot:\nHa...!Phoenix:\n(Wow, he's totally unfazed! Doesn't anything intimidate this guy...?)Judge:\nVery well. Your testimony please, witness. Please tell the court what happened that day at Tr\u00e9s Bien.Armstrong:\nOui! Volontiers!Witness Testimony-- At Tr\u00e9s Bien --Armstrong:\nWhen it all 'appened, z'ere were just two customers in my restaurant.\nI remember I was experimenting w'iz some new art deco z'at day.\nLike 'aving a large mirror between la tables, for example.\nOui! Per'aps z'at is what la old man was looking at.\nLa cup, la earpiece, and la glasses... 'E would 'ave seen everyz'ing in reverse, non?Phoenix:\nA m...m...m... MIRROR!?Armstrong:\nOui! Un grand mirror! La most enormous mirror!Godot:\nAnd suddenly, the mystery disappears! Like I said, the world keeps turning, so roll with it!Judge:\nHmm... That would explain the coffee cup and the earpiece conundrum... The mirror would have made everything appear back to front.Phoenix:\n(What the heck!? It's way too early in the morning for this to be happening to me!)Judge:\nNow then, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- At Tr\u00e9s Bien --Armstrong:\nWhen it all 'appened, z'ere were just two customers in my restaurant.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd who were the two customers, exactly?\nArmstrong:\nMais, of course. La young man who died... ...and la other, not-so-young, man.\nJudge:\nHmm... You are referring to yesterday's witness, I presume?\nPhoenix:\n(What about the other man Maggey says she saw at the table? Something tells me Mr. Armstrong isn't planning to disclose his existence...)\nMaya:\nWe need some hard evidence first before we can bring him up, don't we...?\nPhoenix:\nI guess I'll just have to try a different approach for the time being.Armstrong:\nI remember I was experimenting w'iz some new art deco z'at day.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou were experimenting with art deco? How come I never heard about that before today?\nArmstrong:\nYou are not familiar w'iz z'e language of interior design, monsieur?\nPhoenix:\nPlease stay on topic! Now, why didn't you tell the court about this before!?\nArmstrong:\nBut I did. Just a few moments ago!\nJudge:\nAhem! Excuse me, Mr. Armstrong. This \"deco\" you mentioned... Are you referring to some sort of \"decocture\"?\nPhoenix:\nNo, no! Art deco, it is a style of design! ...Your Honor. He's talking about interior design. Walls, ceilings, carpets, that kind of thing.\nJudge:\nAh, yes. Of course. That \"deco\".\nArmstrong:\nI was trying to achieve a more \"la effeminate\" look for my restaurant. I was planning z'e most bold remodeling of la decor.Armstrong:\nLike 'aving a large mirror between la tables, for example.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow big of a mirror are we talking about here?\nArmstrong:\nBof! Something about 4 meters wide and, err... Oui. About 2 meters 'igh.\nPhoenix:\n(Let's see... If 1 meter is about 1 yard... Holy glass in a frame, that's huge!)\nArmstrong:\nI was intending to install it on la ceiling eventually.\nPhoenix:\nThe ceiling!? (Was there a mirror on the ceiling!? I don't remember...)\nArmstrong:\nMais, non. But I decided not to go through w'iz it in z'e end.\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I ask him more about the mirror or not?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(He couldn't lie about such a huge object like that. It must've been there in the restaurant somewhere.)\nGodot:\n...\nLeads to:\n\"Hmm... So the witness yesterday had seen the victim reflected in a mirror...\"\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIf you really had such a large mirror in the restaurant, someone would have noticed it! But there's nothing about a mirror in Mr. Kudo or Maggey Byrde's testimonies!\nArmstrong:\nB-But...\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nYou didn't ask, Trite. You have only yourself to blame for such sloppy work.\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nGodot:\nA mirror was delivered to Tr\u00e9s Bien the day before the incident.\nPhoenix:\nR-Really?\nGodot:\nAs Mr. Armstrong testified, he was carrying out some design changes. And as it turned out, he didn't actually use the mirror in the end.\nPhoenix:\n(This just doesn't add up. Even if a mirror was delivered to Tr\u00e9s Bien... ...it doesn't prove that it was in the restaurant on the day of the crime.)\nGodot:\nHa...! If you want to doubt someone, Trite, look in the mirror. I'm sure the person looking back at you will be dubious enough!\nLeads to:\n\"Hmm... So the witness yesterday had seen the victim reflected in a mirror...\"\n\n\nJudge:\nHmm... So the witness yesterday had seen the victim reflected in a mirror...Armstrong:\nOui! Per'aps z'at is what la old man was looking at.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nNormally, I'd expect people to know the difference between a reflection and a real object.\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\n\"Normally\"? How does normality come into this? That's lame, Trite. Even for you.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGodot:\nAre you trying to say that if something isn't normal, it isn't possible? Is that it? Where does that leave the porcu-headed lawyer and the topknot chick over there... and the ungodly cool guy with the mask over here? Well, Trite!?\nPhoenix:\nAaack! Not the hair!\nMaya:\nI do not have a topknot!\nJudge:\nMr. Godot is correct. A lack of normality is no basis for discounting an argument.\nArmstrong:\nBien! Logic 'as won la day!Armstrong:\nLa cup, la earpiece, and la glasses... 'E would 'ave seen everyz'ing in reverse, non?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nEverything? He would have seen everything in reverse?\nArmstrong:\nOui.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick... We should take a sec and think about what Old Seedy said in his testimony...\nPhoenix:\n(How did he phrase it again...?)\n\n\nKudo:\nThe boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs.\n\n\nKudo:\nNo question! You can lock me up if I'm wrong! It was his left ear, without a doubt!\n\n\nKudo:\nAnd then he used the same hand to pick up the cup. His left hand!\n\n\nMaya:\nIf he saw everything he described reflected in a mirror... ...then everything he said he saw on the \"left\" was actually on the \"right\", huh.\nPhoenix:\n(And that clears up all the problems with his testimony, I guess... Or does it...?)\nGodot:\nHa...!Present Glen Elg profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The coffee cup, the earpiece, and the HMD...\"Phoenix:\n(It's kinda hard to believe everything's the fault of a mirror, but...)Maya:\nDo you think Old Seedy saw everything through a reflection...?Phoenix:\nIf he did, it would explain all the contradictions in his testimony.Maya:\nBut that just makes the situation worse for Maggey! There's gotta be something in that old man's testimony! We've just gotta dig deeper!Phoenix:\nThe coffee cup, the earpiece, and the HMD... Let's think back over Mr. Kudo's testimony for a second, shall we?Kudo:\nThe boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs.Kudo:\nNo question! You can lock me up if I'm wrong! It was his left ear, without a doubt!Phoenix:\nSo, to summarize... ...we were told both the HMD and the earpiece were on the victim's left side. Now, if Mr. Kudo saw all that as a reflection in a mirror... ...it means both the HMD and the earpiece were actually on the victim's right side.Armstrong:\nExactement! You see, monsieur. Now z'at you think about it, it is not so 'ard, non?Phoenix:\nUnfortunately, that's where we run into a monumental contradiction with the facts! If Mr. Kudo really did see everything in a mirror... ...why is it that the HMD is now on the wrong side of his head!?Judge:\nOrder! Order! ...Mr. Wright is correct! If the witness genuinely observed the victim reflected in a mirror... ...then we would expect the victim's eyepiece to have been over his right eye.Godot:Godot:\n...How bitter. Trite, you should have a taste of this bitterness. It'll calm you down in no time.Phoenix:\nA-Are we talking about your coffee... or something completely different...?Godot:\nYou don't understand the way the witness thinks.Judge:\nHow he thinks?Godot:\nYou remember this, I presume?Phoenix:\nThe \"I broke the vase... sorry\" apology lett-- I mean Mr. Kudo's sworn testimony?Godot:\nExactly. The old man has one very grievous habit... other than throwing seeds. The more of an impression something makes, the more muddled his mind makes it. And what's the most striking thing about Mr. Elg?Judge:\nClearly, it's the victim's eyepiece.Godot:\nAnd that's my point. The old man strikes again! Mr. Elg's HMD made a big impression on the old man. \"I saw the earpiece and those new-fangled spectacles he was wearing! Oh, yes! They were both on his left ear! Do you hear? His left ear!\" Ha...! Well, Trite?Phoenix:\nUrk... (That's the worst, but best impression of Kudo ever...)Maya:\nWow! I really thought he was Old Seedy for a minute there! Godot's good!Judge:\nEnough! I must agree that yesterday's witness was irresponsibly rash in much of his testimony.Maya:\nBad luck, Nick. Looks like the \"boil\" of a contradiction you found is just a \"rash\".Godot:\nA mirror can't be beaten by a handful of seeds, nor can it lie. So... What exactly was the old man looking at? Fill us in, Mr. Armstrong. Go on, tell the court. We're all ears.Armstrong:\nOui. I can explain. Please, if you will look at la plans of la restaurant.Witness Testimony-- The Mirror --Armstrong:\nAlors. Is everyone sitting comfortably?\nLa mirror, it was in z'e middle of la restaurant, dividing z'e two 'alves.\nZ'ere is only one seat from which you could 'ave seen an image of la victim.\nZ'at was la seat at z'e table next to la victim's. Z'at was where la old man was sitting.\nAfter la terrible incident occurred, I move la mirror so it was not in z'e way.\nBut naturally, I did not touch anything else!Judge:\nHmm... I see no problems with the explanation we have just heard. From the table next to the victim's, Mr. Kudo could have seen the victim in the mirror.Armstrong:\nWhat a naughty little coquette I am, confusing all z'e men like z'is!Godot:\nDon't worry about it. We can keep up, except for the guy breaking out in a cold sweat over there again.Phoenix:\n(Argh! I hate that guy!)Judge:\nYou said you didn't touch anything else apart from the mirror. Are you quite sure about that?Armstrong:\nVolontiers! Of course!Judge:\nVery well. Mr. Wright. Your cross-examination, if you please.Cross Examination",

      "newContext": "-- At Tr\u00e9s Bien --Armstrong:\nWhen it all 'appened, z'ere were just two customers in my restaurant.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd who were the two customers, exactly?\nArmstrong:\nMais, of course. La young man who died... ...and la other, not-so-young, man.\nJudge:\nHmm... You are referring to yesterday's witness, I presume?\nPhoenix:\n(What about the other man Maggey says she saw at the table? Something tells me Mr. Armstrong isn't planning to disclose his existence...)\nMaya:\nWe need some hard evidence first before we can bring him up, don't we...?\nPhoenix:\nI guess I'll just have to try a different approach for the time being.Armstrong:\nI remember I was experimenting w'iz some new art deco z'at day.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou were experimenting with art deco? How come I never heard about that before today?\nArmstrong:\nYou are not familiar w'iz z'e language of interior design, monsieur?\nPhoenix:\nPlease stay on topic! Now, why didn't you tell the court about this before!?\nArmstrong:\nBut I did. Just a few moments ago!\nJudge:\nAhem! Excuse me, Mr. Armstrong. This \"deco\" you mentioned... Are you referring to some sort of \"decocture\"?\nPhoenix:\nNo, no! Art deco, it is a style of design! ...Your Honor. He's talking about interior design. Walls, ceilings, carpets, that kind of thing.\nJudge:\nAh, yes. Of course. That \"deco\".\nArmstrong:\nI was trying to achieve a more \"la effeminate\" look for my restaurant. I was planning z'e most bold remodeling of la decor.Armstrong:\nLike 'aving a large mirror between la tables, for example.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow big of a mirror are we talking about here?\nArmstrong:\nBof! Something about 4 meters wide and, err... Oui. About 2 meters 'igh.\nPhoenix:\n(Let's see... If 1 meter is about 1 yard... Holy glass in a frame, that's huge!)\nArmstrong:\nI was intending to install it on la ceiling eventually.\nPhoenix:\nThe ceiling!? (Was there a mirror on the ceiling!? I don't remember...)\nArmstrong:\nMais, non. But I decided not to go through w'iz it in z'e end.\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I ask him more about the mirror or not?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(He couldn't lie about such a huge object like that. It must've been there in the restaurant somewhere.)\nGodot:\n...\nLeads to:\n\"Hmm... So the witness yesterday had seen the victim reflected in a mirror...\"\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIf you really had such a large mirror in the restaurant, someone would have noticed it! But there's nothing about a mirror in Mr. Kudo or Maggey Byrde's testimonies!\nArmstrong:\nB-But...\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nYou didn't ask, Trite. You have only yourself to blame for such sloppy work.\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nGodot:\nA mirror was delivered to Tr\u00e9s Bien the day before the incident.\nPhoenix:\nR-Really?\nGodot:\nAs Mr. Armstrong testified, he was carrying out some design changes. And as it turned out, he didn't actually use the mirror in the end.\nPhoenix:\n(This just doesn't add up. Even if a mirror was delivered to Tr\u00e9s Bien... ...it doesn't prove that it was in the restaurant on the day of the crime.)\nGodot:\nHa...! If you want to doubt someone, Trite, look in the mirror. I'm sure the person looking back at you will be dubious enough!\nLeads to:\n\"Hmm... So the witness yesterday had seen the victim reflected in a mirror...\"\n\n\nJudge:\nHmm... So the witness yesterday had seen the victim reflected in a mirror...Armstrong:\nOui! Per'aps z'at is what la old man was looking at.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nNormally, I'd expect people to know the difference between a reflection and a real object.\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\n\"Normally\"? How does normality come into this? That's lame, Trite. Even for you.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGodot:\nAre you trying to say that if something isn't normal, it isn't possible? Is that it? Where does that leave the porcu-headed lawyer and the topknot chick over there... and the ungodly cool guy with the mask over here? Well, Trite!?\nPhoenix:\nAaack! Not the hair!\nMaya:\nI do not have a topknot!\nJudge:\nMr. Godot is correct. A lack of normality is no basis for discounting an argument.\nArmstrong:\nBien! Logic 'as won la day!Armstrong:\nLa cup, la earpiece, and la glasses... 'E would 'ave seen everyz'ing in reverse, non?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nEverything? He would have seen everything in reverse?\nArmstrong:\nOui.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick... We should take a sec and think about what Old Seedy said in his testimony...\nPhoenix:\n(How did he phrase it again...?)\n\n\nKudo:\nThe boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs.\n\n\nKudo:\nNo question! You can lock me up if I'm wrong! It was his left ear, without a doubt!\n\n\nKudo:\nAnd then he used the same hand to pick up the cup. His left hand!\n\n\nMaya:\nIf he saw everything he described reflected in a mirror... ...then everything he said he saw on the \"left\" was actually on the \"right\", huh.\nPhoenix:\n(And that clears up all the problems with his testimony, I guess... Or does it...?)\nGodot:\nHa...!Present Glen Elg profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The coffee cup, the earpiece, and the HMD...\"Phoenix:\n(It's kinda hard to believe everything's the fault of a mirror, but...)Maya:\nDo you think Old Seedy saw everything through a reflection...?Phoenix:\nIf he did, it would explain all the contradictions in his testimony.Maya:\nBut that just makes the situation worse for Maggey! There's gotta be something in that old man's testimony! We've just gotta dig deeper!Phoenix:\nThe coffee cup, the earpiece, and the HMD... Let's think back over Mr. Kudo's testimony for a second, shall we?Kudo:\nThe boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs.Kudo:\nNo question! You can lock me up if I'm wrong! It was his left ear, without a doubt!Phoenix:\nSo, to summarize... ...we were told both the HMD and the earpiece were on the victim's left side. Now, if Mr. Kudo saw all that as a reflection in a mirror... ...it means both the HMD and the earpiece were actually on the victim's right side.Armstrong:\nExactement! You see, monsieur. Now z'at you think about it, it is not so 'ard, non?Phoenix:\nUnfortunately, that's where we run into a monumental contradiction with the facts! If Mr. Kudo really did see everything in a mirror... ...why is it that the HMD is now on the wrong side of his head!?Judge:\nOrder! Order! ...Mr. Wright is correct! If the witness genuinely observed the victim reflected in a mirror... ...then we would expect the victim's eyepiece to have been over his right eye.Godot:Godot:\n...How bitter. Trite, you should have a taste of this bitterness. It'll calm you down in no time.Phoenix:\nA-Are we talking about your coffee... or something completely different...?Godot:\nYou don't understand the way the witness thinks.Judge:\nHow he thinks?Godot:\nYou remember this, I presume?Phoenix:\nThe \"I broke the vase... sorry\" apology lett-- I mean Mr. Kudo's sworn testimony?Godot:\nExactly. The old man has one very grievous habit... other than throwing seeds. The more of an impression something makes, the more muddled his mind makes it. And what's the most striking thing about Mr. Elg?Judge:\nClearly, it's the victim's eyepiece.Godot:\nAnd that's my point. The old man strikes again! Mr. Elg's HMD made a big impression on the old man. \"I saw the earpiece and those new-fangled spectacles he was wearing! Oh, yes! They were both on his left ear! Do you hear? His left ear!\" Ha...! Well, Trite?Phoenix:\nUrk... (That's the worst, but best impression of Kudo ever...)Maya:\nWow! I really thought he was Old Seedy for a minute there! Godot's good!Judge:\nEnough! I must agree that yesterday's witness was irresponsibly rash in much of his testimony.Maya:\nBad luck, Nick. Looks like the \"boil\" of a contradiction you found is just a \"rash\".Godot:\nA mirror can't be beaten by a handful of seeds, nor can it lie. So... What exactly was the old man looking at? Fill us in, Mr. Armstrong. Go on, tell the court. We're all ears.Armstrong:\nOui. I can explain. Please, if you will look at la plans of la restaurant.Witness Testimony-- The Mirror --Armstrong:\nAlors. Is everyone sitting comfortably?\nLa mirror, it was in z'e middle of la restaurant, dividing z'e two 'alves.\nZ'ere is only one seat from which you could 'ave seen an image of la victim.\nZ'at was la seat at z'e table next to la victim's. Z'at was where la old man was sitting.\nAfter la terrible incident occurred, I move la mirror so it was not in z'e way.\nBut naturally, I did not touch anything else!Judge:\nHmm... I see no problems with the explanation we have just heard. From the table next to the victim's, Mr. Kudo could have seen the victim in the mirror.Armstrong:\nWhat a naughty little coquette I am, confusing all z'e men like z'is!Godot:\nDon't worry about it. We can keep up, except for the guy breaking out in a cold sweat over there again.Phoenix:\n(Argh! I hate that guy!)Judge:\nYou said you didn't touch anything else apart from the mirror. Are you quite sure about that?Armstrong:\nVolontiers! Of course!Judge:\nVery well. Mr. Wright. Your cross-examination, if you please.Cross Examination",

Yesterday's session didn't go so well, and then ended on a giant mystery.Phoenix:\n(That's true... And we still haven't solved a single part of it yet...)Maya:\nAre you OK, Nick?Phoenix:\nHuh? Oh, uh... Yeah. Of course.Byrde:\nI saw that! That little flash of doubt in your eyes!Phoenix:\nN-No! That wasn't doubt. That was, umm... determination!Byrde:\nWhy don't I believe you...?Maya:\nIt's nearly time, Maggey. You'd better get going to the defendant's seat.Byrde:\nRoger. Don't let me down, Mr. Wright. I'm counting on you!Hey, pal!Phoenix:\nHey, Detective Gumshoe...Gumshoe:\nQuit stressing Maggey out! She doesn't need that!Phoenix:\nH-How did you know she was stressed...?Gumshoe:\nI was watching through the doorway.Phoenix:\nOh...Gumshoe:\nYou look like you lost the case already. Show a bit of confidence, will you, pal!? Here, maybe this'll help.Maya:\nHuh!? Have you taken up aromatherapy, too?Gumshoe:\nNot in a million years, pal! Don't tell me that you don't remember this thing?Phoenix:\n(Hmm... Come to think of it, that doesn't look like one of those aromatherapy bottles...)Gumshoe:\nThis is the small bottle that turned up in Tr\u00e9s Bien's kitchen a couple of days ago.Maya:\nWow! Look at all these little bottles!Phoenix:\nOh! They're aromatherapy oils! He's got so many, they're overflowing onto the floor...Maya:\nHey, wait a minute... There's one bottle that's different from all the others.Phoenix:\nWell what do you know. And it doesn't have a label either.Maya:\nAnd... *sniff* It doesn't smell.Gumshoe:\nWe finally got the analysis results back from the lab.Maya:\nSo!? What is it? Is it the poison?Gumshoe:\nI'm afraid not, pal. It's... medication.Maya:\nMedication?Gumshoe:\nYeah. For ears. Topical use only, apparently.Phoenix:\nFor ears? You mean...?Gumshoe:\nYeah. It's the medication Glen Elg was using for his ruptured eardrum!Phoenix:\n(What was Glen Elg's ear medicine doing in the kitchen...?)Small Bottle refiled into the Court Record.Phoenix:\nUm, what about the unidentified fingerprints? Anything on that?Gumshoe:\nSomeone screwed up, so they only had time to analyze the contents of the bottle. Another hour and they might have gotten something on the prints, but...Phoenix:\n(Hmm... That's going to weaken its impact as a piece of evidence...)Gumshoe:\nOK, pal! This is it! Make sure your defense is impregnable today, got it!?Phoenix:\n(Today's trial... I'm gonna expose that guy for what he's done, or my name isn't Phoenix Wright!)January 8, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Maggey Byrde.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Godot:\nReady and waiting as always, Your Honor.Judge:\nVery good. Then we'll get underway at once. Yesterday we heard the testimony of Mr. Victor Kudo. He claims to have witnessed the defendant putting a powder into the victim's coffee. However, the witness's testimony was plagued with a number of problems.Godot:\nThe mark on the rim of the cup shows that the victim drank from it with his right hand. But according to the old man's testimony, he picked it up with his left hand.Judge:\nThank you, Mr. Godot. Furthermore, according to the witness's account... ...the victim was listening to the radio with an earpiece in his left ear. Yet, the victim's left eardrum was ruptured, which made him effectively deaf in that ear.Maya:\nIt's amazing how many contradictions a single case can have, huh Nick?Godot:\nHa...! Allow me to enlighten you, Your Honor. The world, you see, keeps turning, and we must turn with it.Judge:\n... You've lost me already, Mr. Godot.Godot:\nDon't let the mysteries of yesterday mystify you today. Only losers think like that. You've got to change with the times! That's one of my rules!Judge:\nAre you implying that you've resolved these contradictions? You know the answers to these riddles!?Godot:\nThe old guy wasn't just throwing seed in here. He was throwing us off the scent. And today I'll prove it.Judge:\nVery well. Let the first witness take the stand!Godot:\nAnd you are?Armstrong:\nOh bonjour, everyone! I am Jean Armstrong. z'e owner and 'ead chef of la Tr\u00e9s Bien restaurant. Enchant\u00e9!.........Judge:\nForgive me for asking, witness, but... are you a woman?Armstrong:\nOh l\u00e0 l\u00e0, monsieur! As you can see, I am la pert and perky gentleman, non?Judge:\nEr... Umm...Godot:\nOn the day of the incident, you were in Tr\u00e9s Bien's kitchen. Isn't that right?Armstrong:\nW'iz you monsieur...Godot:\n...?Armstrong:\n...everything feels right!Godot:\nHa...!Phoenix:\n(Wow, he's totally unfazed! Doesn't anything intimidate this guy...?)Judge:\nVery well. Your testimony please, witness. Please tell the court what happened that day at Tr\u00e9s Bien.Armstrong:\nOui! Volontiers!Witness Testimony-- At Tr\u00e9s Bien --Armstrong:\nWhen it all 'appened, z'ere were just two customers in my restaurant.\nI remember I was experimenting w'iz some new art deco z'at day.\nLike 'aving a large mirror between la tables, for example.\nOui! Per'aps z'at is what la old man was looking at.\nLa cup, la earpiece, and la glasses... 'E would 'ave seen everyz'ing in reverse, non?Phoenix:\nA m...m...m... MIRROR!?Armstrong:\nOui! Un grand mirror! La most enormous mirror!Godot:\nAnd suddenly, the mystery disappears! Like I said, the world keeps turning, so roll with it!Judge:\nHmm... That would explain the coffee cup and the earpiece conundrum... The mirror would have made everything appear back to front.Phoenix:\n(What the heck!? It's way too early in the morning for this to be happening to me!)Judge:\nNow then, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- At Tr\u00e9s Bien --Armstrong:\nWhen it all 'appened, z'ere were just two customers in my restaurant.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd who were the two customers, exactly?\nArmstrong:\nMais, of course. La young man who died... ...and la other, not-so-young, man.\nJudge:\nHmm... You are referring to yesterday's witness, I presume?\nPhoenix:\n(What about the other man Maggey says she saw at the table? Something tells me Mr. Armstrong isn't planning to disclose his existence...)\nMaya:\nWe need some hard evidence first before we can bring him up, don't we...?\nPhoenix:\nI guess I'll just have to try a different approach for the time being.Armstrong:\nI remember I was experimenting w'iz some new art deco z'at day.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou were experimenting with art deco? How come I never heard about that before today?\nArmstrong:\nYou are not familiar w'iz z'e language of interior design, monsieur?\nPhoenix:\nPlease stay on topic! Now, why didn't you tell the court about this before!?\nArmstrong:\nBut I did. Just a few moments ago!\nJudge:\nAhem! Excuse me, Mr. Armstrong. This \"deco\" you mentioned... Are you referring to some sort of \"decocture\"?\nPhoenix:\nNo, no! Art deco, it is a style of design! ...Your Honor. He's talking about interior design. Walls, ceilings, carpets, that kind of thing.\nJudge:\nAh, yes. Of course. That \"deco\".\nArmstrong:\nI was trying to achieve a more \"la effeminate\" look for my restaurant. I was planning z'e most bold remodeling of la decor.Armstrong:\nLike 'aving a large mirror between la tables, for example.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow big of a mirror are we talking about here?\nArmstrong:\nBof! Something about 4 meters wide and, err... Oui. About 2 meters 'igh.\nPhoenix:\n(Let's see... If 1 meter is about 1 yard... Holy glass in a frame, that's huge!)\nArmstrong:\nI was intending to install it on la ceiling eventually.\nPhoenix:\nThe ceiling!? (Was there a mirror on the ceiling!? I don't remember...)\nArmstrong:\nMais, non. But I decided not to go through w'iz it in z'e end.\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I ask him more about the mirror or not?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(He couldn't lie about such a huge object like that. It must've been there in the restaurant somewhere.)\nGodot:\n...\nLeads to:\n\"Hmm... So the witness yesterday had seen the victim reflected in a mirror...\"\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIf you really had such a large mirror in the restaurant, someone would have noticed it! But there's nothing about a mirror in Mr. Kudo or Maggey Byrde's testimonies!\nArmstrong:\nB-But...\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nYou didn't ask, Trite. You have only yourself to blame for such sloppy work.\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nGodot:\nA mirror was delivered to Tr\u00e9s Bien the day before the incident.\nPhoenix:\nR-Really?\nGodot:\nAs Mr. Armstrong testified, he was carrying out some design changes. And as it turned out, he didn't actually use the mirror in the end.\nPhoenix:\n(This just doesn't add up. Even if a mirror was delivered to Tr\u00e9s Bien... ...it doesn't prove that it was in the restaurant on the day of the crime.)\nGodot:\nHa...! If you want to doubt someone, Trite, look in the mirror. I'm sure the person looking back at you will be dubious enough!\nLeads to:\n\"Hmm... So the witness yesterday had seen the victim reflected in a mirror...\"\n\n\nJudge:\nHmm... So the witness yesterday had seen the victim reflected in a mirror...Armstrong:\nOui! Per'aps z'at is what la old man was looking at.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nNormally, I'd expect people to know the difference between a reflection and a real object.\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\n\"Normally\"? How does normality come into this? That's lame, Trite. Even for you.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGodot:\nAre you trying to say that if something isn't normal, it isn't possible? Is that it? Where does that leave the porcu-headed lawyer and the topknot chick over there... and the ungodly cool guy with the mask over here? Well, Trite!?\nPhoenix:\nAaack! Not the hair!\nMaya:\nI do not have a topknot!\nJudge:\nMr. Godot is correct. A lack of normality is no basis for discounting an argument.\nArmstrong:\nBien! Logic 'as won la day!Armstrong:\nLa cup, la earpiece, and la glasses... 'E would 'ave seen everyz'ing in reverse, non?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nEverything? He would have seen everything in reverse?\nArmstrong:\nOui.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick... We should take a sec and think about what Old Seedy said in his testimony...\nPhoenix:\n(How did he phrase it again...?)\n\n\nKudo:\nThe boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs.\n\n\nKudo:\nNo question! You can lock me up if I'm wrong! It was his left ear, without a doubt!\n\n\nKudo:\nAnd then he used the same hand to pick up the cup. His left hand!\n\n\nMaya:\nIf he saw everything he described reflected in a mirror... ...then everything he said he saw on the \"left\" was actually on the \"right\", huh.\nPhoenix:\n(And that clears up all the problems with his testimony, I guess... Or does it...?)\nGodot:\nHa...!Present Glen Elg profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The coffee cup, the earpiece, and the HMD...\"Phoenix:\n(It's kinda hard to believe everything's the fault of a mirror, but...)Maya:\nDo you think Old Seedy saw everything through a reflection...?Phoenix:\nIf he did, it would explain all the contradictions in his testimony.Maya:\nBut that just makes the situation worse for Maggey! There's gotta be something in that old man's testimony! We've just gotta dig deeper!Phoenix:\nThe coffee cup, the earpiece, and the HMD... Let's think back over Mr. Kudo's testimony for a second, shall we?Kudo:\nThe boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs.Kudo:\nNo question! You can lock me up if I'm wrong! It was his left ear, without a doubt!Phoenix:\nSo, to summarize... ...we were told both the HMD and the earpiece were on the victim's left side. Now, if Mr. Kudo saw all that as a reflection in a mirror... ...it means both the HMD and the earpiece were actually on the victim's right side.Armstrong:\nExactement! You see, monsieur. Now z'at you think about it, it is not so 'ard, non?Phoenix:\nUnfortunately, that's where we run into a monumental contradiction with the facts! If Mr. Kudo really did see everything in a mirror... ...why is it that the HMD is now on the wrong side of his head!?Judge:\nOrder! Order! ...Mr. Wright is correct! If the witness genuinely observed the victim reflected in a mirror... ...then we would expect the victim's eyepiece to have been over his right eye.Godot:Godot:\n...How bitter. Trite, you should have a taste of this bitterness. It'll calm you down in no time.Phoenix:\nA-Are we talking about your coffee... or something completely different...?Godot:\nYou don't understand the way the witness thinks.Judge:\nHow he thinks?Godot:\nYou remember this, I presume?Phoenix:\nThe \"I broke the vase... sorry\" apology lett-- I mean Mr. Kudo's sworn testimony?Godot:\nExactly. The old man has one very grievous habit... other than throwing seeds. The more of an impression something makes, the more muddled his mind makes it. And what's the most striking thing about Mr. Elg?Judge:\nClearly, it's the victim's eyepiece.Godot:\nAnd that's my point. The old man strikes again! Mr. Elg's HMD made a big impression on the old man. \"I saw the earpiece and those new-fangled spectacles he was wearing! Oh, yes! They were both on his left ear! Do you hear? His left ear!\" Ha...! Well, Trite?Phoenix:\nUrk... (That's the worst, but best impression of Kudo ever...)Maya:\nWow! I really thought he was Old Seedy for a minute there! Godot's good!Judge:\nEnough! I must agree that yesterday's witness was irresponsibly rash in much of his testimony.Maya:\nBad luck, Nick. Looks like the \"boil\" of a contradiction you found is just a \"rash\".Godot:\nA mirror can't be beaten by a handful of seeds, nor can it lie. So... What exactly was the old man looking at? Fill us in, Mr. Armstrong. Go on, tell the court. We're all ears.Armstrong:\nOui. I can explain. Please, if you will look at la plans of la restaurant.Witness Testimony-- The Mirror --Armstrong:\nAlors. Is everyone sitting comfortably?\nLa mirror, it was in z'e middle of la restaurant, dividing z'e two 'alves.\nZ'ere is only one seat from which you could 'ave seen an image of la victim.\nZ'at was la seat at z'e table next to la victim's. Z'at was where la old man was sitting.\nAfter la terrible incident occurred, I move la mirror so it was not in z'e way.\nBut naturally, I did not touch anything else!Judge:\nHmm... I see no problems with the explanation we have just heard. From the table next to the victim's, Mr. Kudo could have seen the victim in the mirror.Armstrong:\nWhat a naughty little coquette I am, confusing all z'e men like z'is!Godot:\nDon't worry about it. We can keep up, except for the guy breaking out in a cold sweat over there again.Phoenix:\n(Argh! I hate that guy!)Judge:\nYou said you didn't touch anything else apart from the mirror. Are you quite sure about that?Armstrong:\nVolontiers! Of course!Judge:\nVery well. Mr. Wright. Your cross-examination, if you please.Cross Examination-- The Mirror --Armstrong:\nLa mirror, it was in z'e middle of la restaurant, dividing z'e two 'alves.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, run this by me again. The mirror was here, correct?\nArmstrong:\nOui.\nPhoenix:\nOui? Really!? Because I know if I were you, I wouldn't have put a mirror there! It would be in the way!\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nLook who's talking, Trite.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGodot:\nYou're obstructing my view, among other things.\nPhoenix:\nBut, but, but! This is my seat in the courtroom...!\nGodot:\nTr\u00e9s Bien's \"charm\" is that it gives you the impression that you're the only customer. Temporarily placing a mirror in that spot would hardly be \"in the way\". Unlike you... Trite.\nArmstrong:\nI tell you, monsieur. la mirror was z'ere, in z'e middle of la restaurant.Armstrong:\nZ'ere is only one seat from which you could 'ave seen an image of la victim.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd where would that be!?\nArmstrong:\nOh l\u00e1 l\u00e1! Look 'ow you lean towards me! I always attract z'e younger boys! Maybe I should keep you in suspense a little longer!\nJudge:\nMr. Armstrong! Tell the court what you know at once!\nArmstrong:\nI attract z'e older ones, too, you know, 'andsome! Shall I tease you, too!?\nJudge:\nNnngh...\nGodot:\nI'm already seeing a very hot someone, so I'm afraid you'll be waiting for a long time.\nMaya:\nI bet she has mocha-cream skin and cappuccino perfume.\nArmstrong:\nBien. I will tell you... Z'ere was only one seat from which you could 'ave seen...Armstrong:\nZ'at was la seat at z'e table next to la victim's. Z'at was where la old man was sitting.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo why can you only see the victim from that particular seat?\nArmstrong:\nMais, monsieur. It is obvious, non? If you look at la plans you will understand. La victim would 'ave been reflected in la mirror like so. If you were sitting at la table next to 'im, you would see everything, non?\nMaya:\nSo that's the seat Old Seedy was sitting in on that day... ...when the poisoning happened.\nPhoenix:\n(The old man was sitting at the table next to the victim? Why does that seem kinda odd...?)Present Victor's Testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! Mr. Kudo's words yesterday strongly contradict Mr. Armstrong's testimony!\nJudge:\nThis is... the letter of apology that was written by Mr. Kudo, is it not?\nPhoenix:\nI realize it looks useless, Your Honor, but this is still testimony.\nGodot:\nHa...! I guess useless people are only really good at identifying useless things.\nJudge:\nWhat relevance does this scrap of paper have to the trial, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nMr. Kudo's testimony is actually very relevant to the question at hand, Your Honor! Because it very clearly contradicts with this piece of evidence!\n\n\n\nPresent Crime Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThis piece of evidence contradicts with testimony we have heard, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nThe crime photo...?\nPhoenix:\nYes. This photo clearly shows something that theoretically should not exist!\nJudge:\nWhat on Earth do you mean by that, Mr. Wright!?\nGodot:\n\"Should not exist\"? Ha... Sounds like you're describing yourself, Trite.\nJudge:\nNow then, if the defense would please clarify its statement. What is the something that \"should not exist\" in this photo?\n\n\n\nPresent vase on left table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"There is one thing that was clearly demonstrated by yesterday's testimony.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThis is what should not be in the picture!\nJudge:\nI'm sorry? I'm afraid you've lost me.\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nGodot:\nHa...! I suppose it's up to me to clarify the defense's claim. The something that \"shouldn't exist\" is clearly...\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait, wait, wait! I've change my mind, Your Honor! (The last thing I need right now is a scalding hot coffee shower...)\nJudge:\nVery well. Gather your thoughts, Mr. Wright. In the meantime, the witness will repeat his testimony for the court.\nArmstrong:\nOui. I would be delighted!\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nWell... ...I'm not sure the contradiction... ...is as clear as you would have us believe, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n...Oh.\nJudge:\nPerhaps you should reconsider before you try again, hm?\nPhoenix:\nTry again...? (You mean I was wrong?)\nJudge:\nVery well. Gather your thoughts, Mr. Wright. In the meantime, the witness will repeat his testimony for the court.\nArmstrong:\nOui.

What is the something that \"should not exist\" in this photo?\n\n\n\nPresent vase on left table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nI think it's pretty obvious that this is what should not be in the picture!\nJudge:\nThe vase!? What possible connection does that have with this witness's testimony?\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor... I'm telling you that there should have been no vase on this table. Because it very clearly contradicts with this piece of evidence!\n\n\n\nPresent Victor's Testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"There is one thing that was clearly demonstrated by yesterday's testimony.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nWell... ...I'm not sure the contradiction... ...is as clear as you would have us believe, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n...Oh.\nJudge:\nPerhaps you should reconsider before you try again, hm?\nPhoenix:\nTry again...?

Exactement. I carried it out of la restaurant z'en.\nPhoenix:\nYou moved a huge mirror like that all by yourself?\nArmstrong:\nWhat can I say? I know 'ow to pick things up, 'andsome!\nPhoenix:\n...\nGodot:\nHeh heh...\nMaya:\nG-Godot actually laughed at something!\nJudge:\nWell, given the witness's physique, I suppose it is possible. Did you move anything else from the crime scene, Mr. Armstrong?\nArmstrong:\nI look like z'e obliging type, non?Armstrong:\nBut naturally, I did not touch anything else!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure about that?\nArmstrong:\nI touched nothing except la mirror!\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright? Is there something the witness has said that doesn't match the crime scene?\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, there is... I just can't put my finger on what exactly.)\nGodot:\nHa...! Suffering from a case of heartburn, Trite?\nArmstrong:\nOh, I 'ave just z'e thing for z'at! An oil with golden myrrh and frankenstaince...\nGodot:\nAdd a few drops to your coffee, and voila! Enjoy.\nPhoenix:\n(Focus, Phoenix. Breathe... I need to ignore those two and just find some evidence.)Present Victor's Testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor!

What possible connection does that have with this witness's testimony?\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor... I'm telling you that there should have been no vase on this table. Because it very clearly contradicts with this piece of evidence!\n\n\n\nPresent Victor's Testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"There is one thing that was clearly demonstrated by yesterday's testimony.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nWell... ...I'm not sure the contradiction... ...is as clear as you would have us believe, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n...Oh.\nJudge:\nPerhaps you should reconsider before you try again, hm?\nPhoenix:\nTry again...? (You mean I was wrong?)\nJudge:\nVery well. Gather your thoughts, Mr. Wright. In the meantime, the witness will repeat his testimony for the court.\nArmstrong:\nOui. I would be delighted!\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThis is what should not be in the picture!\nJudge:\nI'm sorry? I'm afraid you've lost me.\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nGodot:\nHa...! I suppose it's up to me to clarify the defense's claim. The something that \"shouldn't exist\" is clearly...\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait, wait, wait! I've change my mind, Your Honor! (The last thing I need right now is a scalding hot coffee shower...)\nJudge:\nVery well. Gather your thoughts, Mr. Wright. In the meantime, the witness will repeat his testimony for the court.\nArmstrong:\nOui. I would be delighted!\nLeads back to cross-examinationMaya:\nIt is pretty strange, though, isn't it? I mean, nobody mentioned anything about a really large mirror. You'd think someone would've, but Maggey didn't, and neither did Old Seedy.Phoenix:\nThen the only logical explanation is... ...that there was no mirror inside Tr\u00e9s Bien that day. (Now I've just got to prove it... Somehow...)Phoenix:\nThere is one thing that was clearly demonstrated by yesterday's testimony. Mr. Kudo broke the vase that was on the table where he was sitting. And yet! As the court can see, there is an unbroken vase on the table next to the victim! Why? Because Mr. Kudo was not, in fact, sitting at the table next to the victim at all!Godot:Godot:\nDon't be an idiot, Trite! That's impossible! That seat's the only one Kudo could've seen the victim's reflection from!Phoenix:\nExactly!Godot:\n...!Phoenix:\nThere is only one conclusion we can draw from this contradiction. There was no mirror in Tr\u00e9s Bien that day! Your testimony, Mr. Armstrong, is an elaborate lie!Armstrong:\nMon dieeeeeeeu!Godot:Godot:\nDon't try to confuse the court, Trite! Obviously, the witness cleaned up the vase... ...while the police were taking their time getting to the crime scene!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nUnfortunately, Mr. Godot, that doesn't quite work for me. Mr. Armstrong already testified to the contrary. In his own words... \"I did not touch anything else\" except the mirror!Godot:\nUr... urgh! ... Gaaaaaaaaargh!Judge:\nWell, witness? What do you have to say for yourself?Armstrong:\n*sniffle*Phoenix:\n(I was right! There was no mirror in the restaurant that day!)Judge:\nIn light of this revelation, we return back to the original problem. Why did the victim have an earpiece in an ear in which he couldn't hear?Godot:\nHa...! You only get one shot in life. There's no turning back. If you want to claim that the mirror wasn't there, Trite... ...then this problem is all yours. How do you explain what the old man saw?Phoenix:\n(If I can answer this, then I'll be that much closer to the truth! I can feel it!)Maya:\n...Are you going to be OK? Can you really solve this contradiction, Nick?Phoenix:\nThere's more than just this one contradiction, Maya.Maya:\nWhat do you mean?Phoenix:\nRemember what Maggey told us? \"There was another man at the victim's table.\" And, \"there was a sample CD on the victim's table.\" It all flies in the face of Mr. Kudo's testimony. (And I think I know the reason why nothing in this case is adding up.)Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Let's hear your answer.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. The reason behind all the contradictions in Mr. Kudo's testimony is simple.Mr. Kudo made a mistake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nClearly, Mr. Kudo made a mistake!\nGodot:\nMr. Trite... You're the one who brought up all these contradictions.\nPhoenix:\nAnd...?\nGodot:\nIf you're trying to tell us the old man just made a mistake... ...we can wrap up this case right now with a guilty verdict!\nJudge:\nHow about it, Mr. Wright? Should I just declare your client guilty?\nMaya:\nIs that the best you can come up with, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm sorry, Your Honor. I was the one who made a mistake.\nJudge:\nI'll give you one more chance, Mr. Wright. Think carefully before you answer this time!\nLeads back to:\n\"Yes, Your Honor.\"The ear doctor made a mistake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI believe we're looking at this the wrong way. It was actually the doctor's mistake.\nJudge:\nWhat?\nPhoenix:\nYes. The doctor got the wrong ear!\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nWell, I believe we saw an autopsy report yesterday. One that stated the victim's left eardrum was ruptured, and had medicine in it!\nJudge:\nI'm beginning to wonder if it's not your eardrum that's ruptured, Mr. Wright.\nMaya:\nThis is no time to be playing with people's perceptions, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm sorry, Your Honor. I was the one who made a mistake.\nJudge:\nI'll give you one more chance, Mr. Wright. Think carefully before you answer this time!\nLeads back to:\n\"Yes, Your Honor.\"The victim was a phony.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"This case is riddled with contradictions.\"Phoenix:\nThis case is riddled with contradictions. Yet, there is one very simple answer that clears them all up.Judge:\nA-And what is that?Phoenix:\nThe incident Mr. Kudo witnessed, and the incident the victim experienced... ...were two completely different events!Godot:\nWhat!?Phoenix:\nYes! The \"victim\" that Mr. Kudo saw wasn't Mr. Glen Elg at all! It was an imposter -- a phony pretending to be Mr. Elg! Obviously, unlike the victim, there was nothing wrong with the imposter's left eardrum. That's how he ended up wearing the earpiece in his left ear by mistake!Godot:\nPhwoooooooh!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Settle down, or I'll clear the courtroom!Godot:\nQuiet, gramps! Why don't you clear out of here, huh?Judge:\nWHAT DID YOU SAY!?Godot:\nTrite... Are you saying what Mr. Kudo saw was a set-up?Phoenix:\nYes. Someone pretended to be Glen Elg and acted out the whole coffee poisoning. All for the express purpose of creating a \"witness\" out of one Mr. Victor Kudo!Godot:Godot:\nGet real, Trite! Why would anyone want to do that?Phoenix:\nIsn't it obvious? The thing Mr. Kudo was most insistent about in his testimony was...Kudo:\nThe serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it! That's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well!Judge:\nI-It's so hard to believe, but...Phoenix:\nThere was one, and only one reason to show Mr. Kudo this fake poisoning! To show Maggey Byrde in the act of poisoning the coffee!Godot:Godot:\nAre you insinuating that the waitress in the old man's story was a fake as well? It's true that there were no customers in the restaurant at the time, but... ...it's also true that the chef was there! He would have noticed what was happening.Judge:\nTh-That's right! Well, witness? If your restaurant really was the scene of such theatrics... ...you would have known about it, correct!?Armstrong:\nOh l\u00e0 l\u00e0... Z'is is most difficult for me...Phoenix:Phoenix:\nNo, it's quite simple. All you have to do is testify. You are under oath, after all. Was there, in fact, a phony at Tr\u00e9s Bien that day!? The defense demands that Mr. Armstrong tell the whole truth about what happened.Judge:\nThe defense's request for additional testimony is accepted. You will accurately explain, in detail, the events in the restaurant that day!Armstrong:\nOu... Oui.Witness Testimony-- In the Restaurant --Armstrong:\nLa victim, Monsieur Elg, 'e came to my restaurant alone.\nI remember la old man arrived not long after 'im.\nZ'ere were no other customers.\nWhen 'e got word 'e won la lottery, Mon. Elg became very excited.\nIt was approximately 5 minutes later z'at la poisoning incident occurred.\nNon, z'ere was no time for a phony to do la acting.Judge:\n...Just so we're clear, there was no mirror in the restaurant, after all?Armstrong:\nJe vous demande pardon! Forgive me, Your Honor! I lied because I wanted z'is mess to be cleared up quickly.Judge:\nWhat you have just done is commit perjury, Mr. Armstrong! I will decide how to punish you later.Armstrong:\nO-Oui...Judge:\nFor now, we will hear your cross-examination. Mr. Wright, if you please. (Changed from [For now, we will hear your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.] in the original release)Phoenix:\n(Hmm.. He took that perjury charge a bit too well. But I'm guessing he'll be more serious trouble after this cross-examination!)Cross Examination",

(You mean I was wrong?)\nJudge:\nVery well. Gather your thoughts, Mr. Wright. In the meantime, the witness will repeat his testimony for the court.\nArmstrong:\nOui. I would be delighted!\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThis is what should not be in the picture!\nJudge:\nI'm sorry? I'm afraid you've lost me.\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nGodot:\nHa...! I suppose it's up to me to clarify the defense's claim. The something that \"shouldn't exist\" is clearly...\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait, wait, wait! I've change my mind, Your Honor! (The last thing I need right now is a scalding hot coffee shower...)\nJudge:\nVery well. Gather your thoughts, Mr. Wright. In the meantime, the witness will repeat his testimony for the court.\nArmstrong:\nOui. I would be delighted!\nLeads back to cross-examinationMaya:\nIt is pretty strange, though, isn't it? I mean, nobody mentioned anything about a really large mirror. You'd think someone would've, but Maggey didn't, and neither did Old Seedy.Phoenix:\nThen the only logical explanation is... ...that there was no mirror inside Tr\u00e9s Bien that day. (Now I've just got to prove it... Somehow...)Phoenix:\nThere is one thing that was clearly demonstrated by yesterday's testimony. Mr. Kudo broke the vase that was on the table where he was sitting. And yet! As the court can see, there is an unbroken vase on the table next to the victim! Why? Because Mr. Kudo was not, in fact, sitting at the table next to the victim at all!Godot:Godot:\nDon't be an idiot, Trite! That's impossible! That seat's the only one Kudo could've seen the victim's reflection from!Phoenix:\nExactly!Godot:\n...!Phoenix:\nThere is only one conclusion we can draw from this contradiction. There was no mirror in Tr\u00e9s Bien that day! Your testimony, Mr. Armstrong, is an elaborate lie!Armstrong:\nMon dieeeeeeeu!Godot:Godot:\nDon't try to confuse the court, Trite! Obviously, the witness cleaned up the vase... ...while the police were taking their time getting to the crime scene!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nUnfortunately, Mr. Godot, that doesn't quite work for me. Mr. Armstrong already testified to the contrary. In his own words... \"I did not touch anything else\" except the mirror!Godot:\nUr... urgh! ... Gaaaaaaaaargh!Judge:\nWell, witness? What do you have to say for yourself?Armstrong:\n*sniffle*Phoenix:\n(I was right! There was no mirror in the restaurant that day!)Judge:\nIn light of this revelation, we return back to the original problem. Why did the victim have an earpiece in an ear in which he couldn't hear?Godot:\nHa...! You only get one shot in life. There's no turning back. If you want to claim that the mirror wasn't there, Trite... ...then this problem is all yours. How do you explain what the old man saw?Phoenix:\n(If I can answer this, then I'll be that much closer to the truth! I can feel it!)Maya:\n...Are you going to be OK? Can you really solve this contradiction, Nick?Phoenix:\nThere's more than just this one contradiction, Maya.Maya:\nWhat do you mean?Phoenix:\nRemember what Maggey told us? \"There was another man at the victim's table.\" And, \"there was a sample CD on the victim's table.\" It all flies in the face of Mr. Kudo's testimony. (And I think I know the reason why nothing in this case is adding up.)Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Let's hear your answer.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. The reason behind all the contradictions in Mr. Kudo's testimony is simple.Mr. Kudo made a mistake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nClearly, Mr. Kudo made a mistake!\nGodot:\nMr. Trite... You're the one who brought up all these contradictions.\nPhoenix:\nAnd...?\nGodot:\nIf you're trying to tell us the old man just made a mistake... ...we can wrap up this case right now with a guilty verdict!\nJudge:\nHow about it, Mr. Wright? Should I just declare your client guilty?\nMaya:\nIs that the best you can come up with, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm sorry, Your Honor. I was the one who made a mistake.\nJudge:\nI'll give you one more chance, Mr. Wright. Think carefully before you answer this time!\nLeads back to:\n\"Yes, Your Honor.\"The ear doctor made a mistake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI believe we're looking at this the wrong way. It was actually the doctor's mistake.\nJudge:\nWhat?\nPhoenix:\nYes. The doctor got the wrong ear!\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nWell, I believe we saw an autopsy report yesterday. One that stated the victim's left eardrum was ruptured, and had medicine in it!\nJudge:\nI'm beginning to wonder if it's not your eardrum that's ruptured, Mr. Wright.\nMaya:\nThis is no time to be playing with people's perceptions, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm sorry, Your Honor. I was the one who made a mistake.\nJudge:\nI'll give you one more chance, Mr. Wright. Think carefully before you answer this time!\nLeads back to:\n\"Yes, Your Honor.\"The victim was a phony.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"This case is riddled with contradictions.\"Phoenix:\nThis case is riddled with contradictions. Yet, there is one very simple answer that clears them all up.Judge:\nA-And what is that?Phoenix:\nThe incident Mr. Kudo witnessed, and the incident the victim experienced... ...were two completely different events!Godot:\nWhat!?Phoenix:\nYes! The \"victim\" that Mr. Kudo saw wasn't Mr. Glen Elg at all! It was an imposter -- a phony pretending to be Mr. Elg! Obviously, unlike the victim, there was nothing wrong with the imposter's left eardrum. That's how he ended up wearing the earpiece in his left ear by mistake!Godot:\nPhwoooooooh!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Settle down, or I'll clear the courtroom!Godot:\nQuiet, gramps! Why don't you clear out of here, huh?Judge:\nWHAT DID YOU SAY!?Godot:\nTrite... Are you saying what Mr. Kudo saw was a set-up?Phoenix:\nYes. Someone pretended to be Glen Elg and acted out the whole coffee poisoning. All for the express purpose of creating a \"witness\" out of one Mr. Victor Kudo!Godot:Godot:\nGet real, Trite! Why would anyone want to do that?Phoenix:\nIsn't it obvious? The thing Mr. Kudo was most insistent about in his testimony was...Kudo:\nThe serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it! That's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well!Judge:\nI-It's so hard to believe, but...Phoenix:\nThere was one, and only one reason to show Mr. Kudo this fake poisoning! To show Maggey Byrde in the act of poisoning the coffee!Godot:Godot:\nAre you insinuating that the waitress in the old man's story was a fake as well? It's true that there were no customers in the restaurant at the time, but... ...it's also true that the chef was there! He would have noticed what was happening.Judge:\nTh-That's right! Well, witness? If your restaurant really was the scene of such theatrics... ...you would have known about it, correct!?Armstrong:\nOh l\u00e0 l\u00e0... Z'is is most difficult for me...Phoenix:Phoenix:\nNo, it's quite simple. All you have to do is testify. You are under oath, after all. Was there, in fact, a phony at Tr\u00e9s Bien that day!? The defense demands that Mr. Armstrong tell the whole truth about what happened.Judge:\nThe defense's request for additional testimony is accepted. You will accurately explain, in detail, the events in the restaurant that day!Armstrong:\nOu... Oui.Witness Testimony-- In the Restaurant --Armstrong:\nLa victim, Monsieur Elg, 'e came to my restaurant alone.\nI remember la old man arrived not long after 'im.\nZ'ere were no other customers.\nWhen 'e got word 'e won la lottery, Mon. Elg became very excited.\nIt was approximately 5 minutes later z'at la poisoning incident occurred.\nNon, z'ere was no time for a phony to do la acting.Judge:\n...Just so we're clear, there was no mirror in the restaurant, after all?Armstrong:\nJe vous demande pardon! Forgive me, Your Honor! I lied because I wanted z'is mess to be cleared up quickly.Judge:\nWhat you have just done is commit perjury, Mr. Armstrong! I will decide how to punish you later.Armstrong:\nO-Oui...Judge:\nFor now, we will hear your cross-examination. Mr. Wright, if you please. (Changed from [For now, we will hear your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.] in the original release)Phoenix:\n(Hmm.. He took that perjury charge a bit too well. But I'm guessing he'll be more serious trouble after this cross-examination!)Cross Examination",

She doesn't need that!Phoenix:\nH-How did you know she was stressed...?Gumshoe:\nI was watching through the doorway.Phoenix:\nOh...Gumshoe:\nYou look like you lost the case already. Show a bit of confidence, will you, pal!? Here, maybe this'll help.Maya:\nHuh!? Have you taken up aromatherapy, too?Gumshoe:\nNot in a million years, pal! Don't tell me that you don't remember this thing?Phoenix:\n(Hmm... Come to think of it, that doesn't look like one of those aromatherapy bottles...)Gumshoe:\nThis is the small bottle that turned up in Tr\u00e9s Bien's kitchen a couple of days ago.Maya:\nWow! Look at all these little bottles!Phoenix:\nOh! They're aromatherapy oils! He's got so many, they're overflowing onto the floor...Maya:\nHey, wait a minute... There's one bottle that's different from all the others.Phoenix:\nWell what do you know. And it doesn't have a label either.Maya:\nAnd... *sniff* It doesn't smell.Gumshoe:\nWe finally got the analysis results back from the lab.Maya:\nSo!? What is it? Is it the poison?Gumshoe:\nI'm afraid not, pal. It's... medication.Maya:\nMedication?Gumshoe:\nYeah. For ears. Topical use only, apparently.Phoenix:\nFor ears? You mean...?Gumshoe:\nYeah. It's the medication Glen Elg was using for his ruptured eardrum!Phoenix:\n(What was Glen Elg's ear medicine doing in the kitchen...?)Small Bottle refiled into the Court Record.Phoenix:\nUm, what about the unidentified fingerprints? Anything on that?Gumshoe:\nSomeone screwed up, so they only had time to analyze the contents of the bottle. Another hour and they might have gotten something on the prints, but...Phoenix:\n(Hmm... That's going to weaken its impact as a piece of evidence...)Gumshoe:\nOK, pal! This is it! Make sure your defense is impregnable today, got it!?Phoenix:\n(Today's trial... I'm gonna expose that guy for what he's done, or my name isn't Phoenix Wright!)January 8, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Maggey Byrde.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Godot:\nReady and waiting as always, Your Honor.Judge:\nVery good. Then we'll get underway at once. Yesterday we heard the testimony of Mr. Victor Kudo. He claims to have witnessed the defendant putting a powder into the victim's coffee. However, the witness's testimony was plagued with a number of problems.Godot:\nThe mark on the rim of the cup shows that the victim drank from it with his right hand. But according to the old man's testimony, he picked it up with his left hand.Judge:\nThank you, Mr. Godot. Furthermore, according to the witness's account... ...the victim was listening to the radio with an earpiece in his left ear. Yet, the victim's left eardrum was ruptured, which made him effectively deaf in that ear.Maya:\nIt's amazing how many contradictions a single case can have, huh Nick?Godot:\nHa...! Allow me to enlighten you, Your Honor. The world, you see, keeps turning, and we must turn with it.Judge:\n... You've lost me already, Mr. Godot.Godot:\nDon't let the mysteries of yesterday mystify you today. Only losers think like that. You've got to change with the times! That's one of my rules!Judge:\nAre you implying that you've resolved these contradictions? You know the answers to these riddles!?Godot:\nThe old guy wasn't just throwing seed in here. He was throwing us off the scent. And today I'll prove it.Judge:\nVery well. Let the first witness take the stand!Godot:\nAnd you are?Armstrong:\nOh bonjour, everyone! I am Jean Armstrong. z'e owner and 'ead chef of la Tr\u00e9s Bien restaurant. Enchant\u00e9!.........Judge:\nForgive me for asking, witness, but... are you a woman?Armstrong:\nOh l\u00e0 l\u00e0, monsieur! As you can see, I am la pert and perky gentleman, non?Judge:\nEr... Umm...Godot:\nOn the day of the incident, you were in Tr\u00e9s Bien's kitchen. Isn't that right?Armstrong:\nW'iz you monsieur...Godot:\n...?Armstrong:\n...everything feels right!Godot:\nHa...!Phoenix:\n(Wow, he's totally unfazed! Doesn't anything intimidate this guy...?)Judge:\nVery well. Your testimony please, witness. Please tell the court what happened that day at Tr\u00e9s Bien.Armstrong:\nOui! Volontiers!Witness Testimony-- At Tr\u00e9s Bien --Armstrong:\nWhen it all 'appened, z'ere were just two customers in my restaurant.\nI remember I was experimenting w'iz some new art deco z'at day.\nLike 'aving a large mirror between la tables, for example.\nOui! Per'aps z'at is what la old man was looking at.\nLa cup, la earpiece, and la glasses... 'E would 'ave seen everyz'ing in reverse, non?Phoenix:\nA m...m...m... MIRROR!?Armstrong:\nOui! Un grand mirror! La most enormous mirror!Godot:\nAnd suddenly, the mystery disappears! Like I said, the world keeps turning, so roll with it!Judge:\nHmm... That would explain the coffee cup and the earpiece conundrum... The mirror would have made everything appear back to front.Phoenix:\n(What the heck!? It's way too early in the morning for this to be happening to me!)Judge:\nNow then, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- At Tr\u00e9s Bien --Armstrong:\nWhen it all 'appened, z'ere were just two customers in my restaurant.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd who were the two customers, exactly?\nArmstrong:\nMais, of course. La young man who died... ...and la other, not-so-young, man.\nJudge:\nHmm... You are referring to yesterday's witness, I presume?\nPhoenix:\n(What about the other man Maggey says she saw at the table? Something tells me Mr. Armstrong isn't planning to disclose his existence...)\nMaya:\nWe need some hard evidence first before we can bring him up, don't we...?\nPhoenix:\nI guess I'll just have to try a different approach for the time being.Armstrong:\nI remember I was experimenting w'iz some new art deco z'at day.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou were experimenting with art deco? How come I never heard about that before today?\nArmstrong:\nYou are not familiar w'iz z'e language of interior design, monsieur?\nPhoenix:\nPlease stay on topic! Now, why didn't you tell the court about this before!?\nArmstrong:\nBut I did. Just a few moments ago!\nJudge:\nAhem! Excuse me, Mr. Armstrong. This \"deco\" you mentioned... Are you referring to some sort of \"decocture\"?\nPhoenix:\nNo, no! Art deco, it is a style of design! ...Your Honor. He's talking about interior design. Walls, ceilings, carpets, that kind of thing.\nJudge:\nAh, yes. Of course. That \"deco\".\nArmstrong:\nI was trying to achieve a more \"la effeminate\" look for my restaurant. I was planning z'e most bold remodeling of la decor.Armstrong:\nLike 'aving a large mirror between la tables, for example.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow big of a mirror are we talking about here?\nArmstrong:\nBof! Something about 4 meters wide and, err... Oui. About 2 meters 'igh.\nPhoenix:\n(Let's see... If 1 meter is about 1 yard... Holy glass in a frame, that's huge!)\nArmstrong:\nI was intending to install it on la ceiling eventually.\nPhoenix:\nThe ceiling!? (Was there a mirror on the ceiling!? I don't remember...)\nArmstrong:\nMais, non. But I decided not to go through w'iz it in z'e end.\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I ask him more about the mirror or not?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(He couldn't lie about such a huge object like that. It must've been there in the restaurant somewhere.)\nGodot:\n...\nLeads to:\n\"Hmm... So the witness yesterday had seen the victim reflected in a mirror...\"\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIf you really had such a large mirror in the restaurant, someone would have noticed it! But there's nothing about a mirror in Mr. Kudo or Maggey Byrde's testimonies!\nArmstrong:\nB-But...\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nYou didn't ask, Trite. You have only yourself to blame for such sloppy work.\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nGodot:\nA mirror was delivered to Tr\u00e9s Bien the day before the incident.\nPhoenix:\nR-Really?\nGodot:\nAs Mr. Armstrong testified, he was carrying out some design changes. And as it turned out, he didn't actually use the mirror in the end.\nPhoenix:\n(This just doesn't add up. Even if a mirror was delivered to Tr\u00e9s Bien... ...it doesn't prove that it was in the restaurant on the day of the crime.)\nGodot:\nHa...! If you want to doubt someone, Trite, look in the mirror. I'm sure the person looking back at you will be dubious enough!\nLeads to:\n\"Hmm... So the witness yesterday had seen the victim reflected in a mirror...\"\n\n\nJudge:\nHmm... So the witness yesterday had seen the victim reflected in a mirror...Armstrong:\nOui! Per'aps z'at is what la old man was looking at.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nNormally, I'd expect people to know the difference between a reflection and a real object.\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\n\"Normally\"? How does normality come into this? That's lame, Trite. Even for you.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGodot:\nAre you trying to say that if something isn't normal, it isn't possible? Is that it? Where does that leave the porcu-headed lawyer and the topknot chick over there... and the ungodly cool guy with the mask over here? Well, Trite!?\nPhoenix:\nAaack! Not the hair!\nMaya:\nI do not have a topknot!\nJudge:\nMr. Godot is correct. A lack of normality is no basis for discounting an argument.\nArmstrong:\nBien! Logic 'as won la day!Armstrong:\nLa cup, la earpiece, and la glasses... 'E would 'ave seen everyz'ing in reverse, non?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nEverything? He would have seen everything in reverse?\nArmstrong:\nOui.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick... We should take a sec and think about what Old Seedy said in his testimony...\nPhoenix:\n(How did he phrase it again...?)\n\n\nKudo:\nThe boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs.\n\n\nKudo:\nNo question! You can lock me up if I'm wrong! It was his left ear, without a doubt!\n\n\nKudo:\nAnd then he used the same hand to pick up the cup. His left hand!\n\n\nMaya:\nIf he saw everything he described reflected in a mirror... ...then everything he said he saw on the \"left\" was actually on the \"right\", huh.\nPhoenix:\n(And that clears up all the problems with his testimony, I guess... Or does it...?)\nGodot:\nHa...!Present Glen Elg profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The coffee cup, the earpiece, and the HMD...\"Phoenix:\n(It's kinda hard to believe everything's the fault of a mirror, but...)Maya:\nDo you think Old Seedy saw everything through a reflection...?Phoenix:\nIf he did, it would explain all the contradictions in his testimony.Maya:\nBut that just makes the situation worse for Maggey! There's gotta be something in that old man's testimony! We've just gotta dig deeper!Phoenix:\nThe coffee cup, the earpiece, and the HMD... Let's think back over Mr. Kudo's testimony for a second, shall we?Kudo:\nThe boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs.Kudo:\nNo question! You can lock me up if I'm wrong! It was his left ear, without a doubt!Phoenix:\nSo, to summarize... ...we were told both the HMD and the earpiece were on the victim's left side. Now, if Mr. Kudo saw all that as a reflection in a mirror... ...it means both the HMD and the earpiece were actually on the victim's right side.Armstrong:\nExactement! You see, monsieur. Now z'at you think about it, it is not so 'ard, non?Phoenix:\nUnfortunately, that's where we run into a monumental contradiction with the facts! If Mr. Kudo really did see everything in a mirror... ...why is it that the HMD is now on the wrong side of his head!?Judge:\nOrder! Order! ...Mr. Wright is correct! If the witness genuinely observed the victim reflected in a mirror... ...then we would expect the victim's eyepiece to have been over his right eye.Godot:Godot:\n...How bitter. Trite, you should have a taste of this bitterness. It'll calm you down in no time.Phoenix:\nA-Are we talking about your coffee... or something completely different...?Godot:\nYou don't understand the way the witness thinks.Judge:\nHow he thinks?Godot:\nYou remember this, I presume?Phoenix:\nThe \"I broke the vase... sorry\" apology lett-- I mean Mr. Kudo's sworn testimony?Godot:\nExactly. The old man has one very grievous habit... other than throwing seeds. The more of an impression something makes, the more muddled his mind makes it. And what's the most striking thing about Mr. Elg?Judge:\nClearly, it's the victim's eyepiece.Godot:\nAnd that's my point. The old man strikes again! Mr. Elg's HMD made a big impression on the old man. \"I saw the earpiece and those new-fangled spectacles he was wearing! Oh, yes! They were both on his left ear! Do you hear? His left ear!\" Ha...! Well, Trite?Phoenix:\nUrk... (That's the worst, but best impression of Kudo ever...)Maya:\nWow! I really thought he was Old Seedy for a minute there! Godot's good!Judge:\nEnough! I must agree that yesterday's witness was irresponsibly rash in much of his testimony.Maya:\nBad luck, Nick. Looks like the \"boil\" of a contradiction you found is just a \"rash\".Godot:\nA mirror can't be beaten by a handful of seeds, nor can it lie. So... What exactly was the old man looking at? Fill us in, Mr. Armstrong. Go on, tell the court. We're all ears.Armstrong:\nOui. I can explain. Please, if you will look at la plans of la restaurant.Witness Testimony-- The Mirror --Armstrong:\nAlors. Is everyone sitting comfortably?\nLa mirror, it was in z'e middle of la restaurant, dividing z'e two 'alves.\nZ'ere is only one seat from which you could 'ave seen an image of la victim.\nZ'at was la seat at z'e table next to la victim's. Z'at was where la old man was sitting.\nAfter la terrible incident occurred, I move la mirror so it was not in z'e way.\nBut naturally, I did not touch anything else!Judge:\nHmm... I see no problems with the explanation we have just heard. From the table next to the victim's, Mr. Kudo could have seen the victim in the mirror.Armstrong:\nWhat a naughty little coquette I am, confusing all z'e men like z'is!Godot:\nDon't worry about it. We can keep up, except for the guy breaking out in a cold sweat over there again.Phoenix:\n(Argh! I hate that guy!)Judge:\nYou said you didn't touch anything else apart from the mirror. Are you quite sure about that?Armstrong:\nVolontiers! Of course!Judge:\nVery well. Mr. Wright. Your cross-examination, if you please.Cross Examination-- The Mirror --Armstrong:\nLa mirror, it was in z'e middle of la restaurant, dividing z'e two 'alves.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, run this by me again. The mirror was here, correct?\nArmstrong:\nOui.\nPhoenix:\nOui? Really!? Because I know if I were you, I wouldn't have put a mirror there! It would be in the way!\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nLook who's talking, Trite.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGodot:\nYou're obstructing my view, among other things.\nPhoenix:\nBut, but, but! This is my seat in the courtroom...!\nGodot:\nTr\u00e9s Bien's \"charm\" is that it gives you the impression that you're the only customer. Temporarily placing a mirror in that spot would hardly be \"in the way\". Unlike you... Trite.\nArmstrong:\nI tell you, monsieur. la mirror was z'ere, in z'e middle of la restaurant.Armstrong:\nZ'ere is only one seat from which you could 'ave seen an image of la victim.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd where would that be!?\nArmstrong:\nOh l\u00e1 l\u00e1! Look 'ow you lean towards me! I always attract z'e younger boys! Maybe I should keep you in suspense a little longer!\nJudge:\nMr. Armstrong! Tell the court what you know at once!\nArmstrong:\nI attract z'e older ones, too, you know, 'andsome! Shall I tease you, too!?\nJudge:\nNnngh...\nGodot:\nI'm already seeing a very hot someone, so I'm afraid you'll be waiting for a long time.\nMaya:\nI bet she has mocha-cream skin and cappuccino perfume.\nArmstrong:\nBien. I will tell you... Z'ere was only one seat from which you could 'ave seen...Armstrong:\nZ'at was la seat at z'e table next to la victim's. Z'at was where la old man was sitting.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo why can you only see the victim from that particular seat?\nArmstrong:\nMais, monsieur. It is obvious, non? If you look at la plans you will understand. La victim would 'ave been reflected in la mirror like so. If you were sitting at la table next to 'im, you would see everything, non?\nMaya:\nSo that's the seat Old Seedy was sitting in on that day... ...when the poisoning happened.\nPhoenix:\n(The old man was sitting at the table next to the victim? Why does that seem kinda odd...?)Present Victor's Testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! Mr. Kudo's words yesterday strongly contradict Mr. Armstrong's testimony!\nJudge:\nThis is... the letter of apology that was written by Mr. Kudo, is it not?\nPhoenix:\nI realize it looks useless, Your Honor, but this is still testimony.\nGodot:\nHa...! I guess useless people are only really good at identifying useless things.\nJudge:\nWhat relevance does this scrap of paper have to the trial, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nMr. Kudo's testimony is actually very relevant to the question at hand, Your Honor! Because it very clearly contradicts with this piece of evidence!\n\n\n\nPresent Crime Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThis piece of evidence contradicts with testimony we have heard, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nThe crime photo...?\nPhoenix:\nYes. This photo clearly shows something that theoretically should not exist!\nJudge:\nWhat on Earth do you mean by that, Mr. Wright!?\nGodot:\n\"Should not exist\"? Ha... Sounds like you're describing yourself, Trite.\nJudge:\nNow then, if the defense would please clarify its statement. What is the something that \"should not exist\" in this photo?\n\n\n\nPresent vase on left table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"There is one thing that was clearly demonstrated by yesterday's testimony.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThis is what should not be in the picture!\nJudge:\nI'm sorry?

The something that \"shouldn't exist\" is clearly...\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait, wait, wait! I've change my mind, Your Honor! (The last thing I need right now is a scalding hot coffee shower...)\nJudge:\nVery well. Gather your thoughts, Mr. Wright. In the meantime, the witness will repeat his testimony for the court.\nArmstrong:\nOui. I would be delighted!\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nWell... ...I'm not sure the contradiction... ...is as clear as you would have us believe, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n...Oh.\nJudge:\nPerhaps you should reconsider before you try again, hm?\nPhoenix:\nTry again...? (You mean I was wrong?)\nJudge:\nVery well. Gather your thoughts, Mr. Wright. In the meantime, the witness will repeat his testimony for the court.\nArmstrong:\nOui.

Exactement. I carried it out of la restaurant z'en.\nPhoenix:\nYou moved a huge mirror like that all by yourself?\nArmstrong:\nWhat can I say? I know 'ow to pick things up, 'andsome!\nPhoenix:\n...\nGodot:\nHeh heh...\nMaya:\nG-Godot actually laughed at something!\nJudge:\nWell, given the witness's physique, I suppose it is possible.

(The last thing I need right now is a scalding hot coffee shower...)\nJudge:\nVery well. Gather your thoughts, Mr. Wright. In the meantime, the witness will repeat his testimony for the court.\nArmstrong:\nOui. I would be delighted!\nLeads back to cross-examinationMaya:\nIt is pretty strange, though, isn't it? I mean, nobody mentioned anything about a really large mirror. You'd think someone would've, but Maggey didn't, and neither did Old Seedy.Phoenix:\nThen the only logical explanation is... ...that there was no mirror inside Tr\u00e9s Bien that day. (Now I've just got to prove it... Somehow...)Phoenix:\nThere is one thing that was clearly demonstrated by yesterday's testimony. Mr. Kudo broke the vase that was on the table where he was sitting. And yet! As the court can see, there is an unbroken vase on the table next to the victim! Why? Because Mr. Kudo was not, in fact, sitting at the table next to the victim at all!Godot:Godot:\nDon't be an idiot, Trite! That's impossible! That seat's the only one Kudo could've seen the victim's reflection from!Phoenix:\nExactly!Godot:\n...!Phoenix:\nThere is only one conclusion we can draw from this contradiction. There was no mirror in Tr\u00e9s Bien that day! Your testimony, Mr. Armstrong, is an elaborate lie!Armstrong:\nMon dieeeeeeeu!Godot:Godot:\nDon't try to confuse the court, Trite! Obviously, the witness cleaned up the vase... ...while the police were taking their time getting to the crime scene!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nUnfortunately, Mr. Godot, that doesn't quite work for me. Mr. Armstrong already testified to the contrary. In his own words... \"I did not touch anything else\" except the mirror!Godot:\nUr... urgh! ... Gaaaaaaaaargh!Judge:\nWell, witness? What do you have to say for yourself?Armstrong:\n*sniffle*Phoenix:\n(I was right! There was no mirror in the restaurant that day!)Judge:\nIn light of this revelation, we return back to the original problem. Why did the victim have an earpiece in an ear in which he couldn't hear?Godot:\nHa...! You only get one shot in life. There's no turning back. If you want to claim that the mirror wasn't there, Trite... ...then this problem is all yours. How do you explain what the old man saw?Phoenix:\n(If I can answer this, then I'll be that much closer to the truth! I can feel it!)Maya:\n...Are you going to be OK? Can you really solve this contradiction, Nick?Phoenix:\nThere's more than just this one contradiction, Maya.Maya:\nWhat do you mean?Phoenix:\nRemember what Maggey told us? \"There was another man at the victim's table.\" And, \"there was a sample CD on the victim's table.\" It all flies in the face of Mr. Kudo's testimony. (And I think I know the reason why nothing in this case is adding up.)Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Let's hear your answer.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. The reason behind all the contradictions in Mr. Kudo's testimony is simple.Mr. Kudo made a mistake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nClearly, Mr. Kudo made a mistake!\nGodot:\nMr. Trite... You're the one who brought up all these contradictions.\nPhoenix:\nAnd...?\nGodot:\nIf you're trying to tell us the old man just made a mistake... ...we can wrap up this case right now with a guilty verdict!\nJudge:\nHow about it, Mr. Wright? Should I just declare your client guilty?\nMaya:\nIs that the best you can come up with, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm sorry, Your Honor. I was the one who made a mistake.\nJudge:\nI'll give you one more chance, Mr. Wright. Think carefully before you answer this time!\nLeads back to:\n\"Yes, Your Honor.\"The ear doctor made a mistake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI believe we're looking at this the wrong way. It was actually the doctor's mistake.\nJudge:\nWhat?\nPhoenix:\nYes. The doctor got the wrong ear!\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nWell, I believe we saw an autopsy report yesterday. One that stated the victim's left eardrum was ruptured, and had medicine in it!\nJudge:\nI'm beginning to wonder if it's not your eardrum that's ruptured, Mr. Wright.\nMaya:\nThis is no time to be playing with people's perceptions, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm sorry, Your Honor. I was the one who made a mistake.\nJudge:\nI'll give you one more chance, Mr. Wright. Think carefully before you answer this time!\nLeads back to:\n\"Yes, Your Honor.\"The victim was a phony.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"This case is riddled with contradictions.\"Phoenix:\nThis case is riddled with contradictions. Yet, there is one very simple answer that clears them all up.Judge:\nA-And what is that?Phoenix:\nThe incident Mr. Kudo witnessed, and the incident the victim experienced... ...were two completely different events!Godot:\nWhat!?Phoenix:\nYes! The \"victim\" that Mr. Kudo saw wasn't Mr. Glen Elg at all! It was an imposter -- a phony pretending to be Mr. Elg! Obviously, unlike the victim, there was nothing wrong with the imposter's left eardrum. That's how he ended up wearing the earpiece in his left ear by mistake!Godot:\nPhwoooooooh!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Settle down, or I'll clear the courtroom!Godot:\nQuiet, gramps! Why don't you clear out of here, huh?Judge:\nWHAT DID YOU SAY!?Godot:\nTrite... Are you saying what Mr. Kudo saw was a set-up?Phoenix:\nYes. Someone pretended to be Glen Elg and acted out the whole coffee poisoning. All for the express purpose of creating a \"witness\" out of one Mr. Victor Kudo!Godot:Godot:\nGet real, Trite! Why would anyone want to do that?Phoenix:\nIsn't it obvious? The thing Mr. Kudo was most insistent about in his testimony was...Kudo:\nThe serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it! That's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well!Judge:\nI-It's so hard to believe, but...Phoenix:\nThere was one, and only one reason to show Mr. Kudo this fake poisoning! To show Maggey Byrde in the act of poisoning the coffee!Godot:Godot:\nAre you insinuating that the waitress in the old man's story was a fake as well? It's true that there were no customers in the restaurant at the time, but... ...it's also true that the chef was there! He would have noticed what was happening.Judge:\nTh-That's right! Well, witness? If your restaurant really was the scene of such theatrics... ...you would have known about it, correct!?Armstrong:\nOh l\u00e0 l\u00e0... Z'is is most difficult for me...Phoenix:Phoenix:\nNo, it's quite simple. All you have to do is testify. You are under oath, after all. Was there, in fact, a phony at Tr\u00e9s Bien that day!? The defense demands that Mr. Armstrong tell the whole truth about what happened.Judge:\nThe defense's request for additional testimony is accepted. You will accurately explain, in detail, the events in the restaurant that day!Armstrong:\nOu... Oui.Witness Testimony-- In the Restaurant --Armstrong:\nLa victim, Monsieur Elg, 'e came to my restaurant alone.\nI remember la old man arrived not long after 'im.\nZ'ere were no other customers.\nWhen 'e got word 'e won la lottery, Mon. Elg became very excited.\nIt was approximately 5 minutes later z'at la poisoning incident occurred.\nNon, z'ere was no time for a phony to do la acting.Judge:\n...Just so we're clear, there was no mirror in the restaurant, after all?Armstrong:\nJe vous demande pardon! Forgive me, Your Honor! I lied because I wanted z'is mess to be cleared up quickly.Judge:\nWhat you have just done is commit perjury, Mr. Armstrong! I will decide how to punish you later.Armstrong:\nO-Oui...Judge:\nFor now, we will hear your cross-examination. Mr. Wright, if you please. (Changed from [For now, we will hear your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.] in the original release)Phoenix:\n(Hmm.. He took that perjury charge a bit too well. But I'm guessing he'll be more serious trouble after this cross-examination!)Cross Examination-- In the Restaurant --Armstrong:\nLa victim, Monsieur Elg, 'e came to my restaurant alone.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWas he alone at his table as well?\nArmstrong:\nMais, oui. I saw 'im from la kitchen.\nPhoenix:\nYet the defendant, Ms. Byrde, remembers it differently. She swears there was another man at the victim's table.\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHa...! Unfortunately for you, Trite... ...yesterday's witness also testified that the victim was alone.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nYou know, seeing you squirm like that reminds me... ...of a certain coffee's bitter-sweet bite.\nPhoenix:\n(What kind of coffee has he been drinking!?)\nMaya:\nIt's not coffee, it's love! It's love that's bitter-sweet.\nPhoenix:\n(Hearing Maya say that makes her seem wise all of a sudden...)Armstrong:\nI remember la old man arrived not long after 'im.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBy old man, you mean Victor Kudo, correct?\nArmstrong:\nOui. 'E comes often for my special coffee.\nGodot:\nI drank your coffee once, Mr. Armstrong. It's special, I'll give you that. It's worth a sip just for the experience.\nArmstrong:\nOh, you make me so 'appy, monsieur! You are most welcome any time!\nGodot:\nI said it was worth one sip, and nothing more.\nPhoenix:\n(So old Mr. Kudo arrived at the restaurant around the same time as the victim. Maybe I should ask about his arrival in more detail.)\n\n\n\nDon't ask anything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(All I need to do is establish that this phony victim really existed. Asking more about the old man is only going to cloud the issue.) I think that's enough about coffee. Please continue with your testimony, Mr. Armstrong.\nArmstrong:\nYou are welcome any time too, Monsieur Wright. I'll brew something special for you!\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nHow many minutes after?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you're saying that not much time elapsed between when the victim and Mr. Kudo arrived?\nArmstrong:\nOui. Z'at is correct.\nPhoenix:\n(But that still leaves the possibility that something happened in that gap of time.) And by your recollection, how much time would you say elapsed?\nArmstrong:\nLet me see... Approximately 2 minutes, I would say.\nPhoenix:\nT-Two minutes!? That's all?\nJudge:\nHmm... It seems unlikely that anything untoward could have happened in such a short time.\nPhoenix:\n(Rats! I knew I shouldn't have pursued this line of questioning...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nWhat time is it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOut of curiosity, about what time was it when Mr. Kudo arrived?\nArmstrong:\nOh, no... I cannot remember, monsieur.\nJudge:\nHmm... I believe we were told by a witness yesterday...\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThe crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.\n\n\nJudge:\nDoes that perhaps jog your memory, witness?\nArmstrong:\nLa incident 'appened about 20 minutes after 'e arrived. So the victim must 'ave arrived between 2:00 PM and 2:10 PM, non?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Just after 2, huh...)\nArmstrong:\nThank you for your 'elp, in jogging my memory, monsieur. You are wonderful!\nJudge:\nHah hah hah! I can't sit here all the time and do nothing now, can I!? The time of day will be added to the witness's testimony.\nArmstrong:\nOui, Monsieur Judge. Everything I do, I do it for you!\nJudge:\nMerci bien. That's French, isn't it? Hah hah hah!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm glad at least one person is in a good mood...)\nMaya:\nH-He's even humming a song to himself...!\nChanges statement from \"I remember la old man arrived not long after 'im.\" to \"I remember la old man arrived not long after 'im, just after 2 PM.\"Armstrong:\nI remember la old man arrived not long after 'im, just after 2 PM.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely sure about the time?\nArmstrong:\nWhen I think really 'ard, 1 am sure it was just after 2. Oui. It is la time I stop serving la lunch menu.\nJudge:\nQuite right. I always break for lunch when the restaurants are serving their specials. I've been known to wind up a case early just to make it on time! Hah hah!\nPhoenix:\n(I guess you should never get between a hungry judge and his lunch...)\nJudge:\nOh, would you look at that! It's almost lunchtime already.\nPhoenix:\nWitness! Get on with your testimony, please!Present Millionaire Radio Flyer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I'm afraid I've finally got you, Mr. Armstrong.\"Armstrong:\nZ'ere were no other customers.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo your only customers were Mr. Kudo and the victim?\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHow many times do you need to ask the same thing, Trite? You'd never catch me drinking the same blend twice!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGodot:\nYou're trying to establish the presence of a \"phony victim\" in the restaurant. But you're wasting your time. You can't grind bird seed to make coffee, if you catch my drift...\nPhoenix:\n(But there's a hole in this testimony somewhere! I'm sure of it!)Armstrong:\nWhen 'e got word 'e won la lottery, Mon. Elg became very excited.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid you see him?\nArmstrong:\nNon, I was in ze kitchen. But I 'eard 'im. I remember 'im shouting, \"Yes! 'Alf a million bucks!\"\nGodot:\nPresumably the defendant heard that too, then, correct?\nArmstrong:\nMaggey...? She looked like a poor little frightened dove!\nPhoenix:\nAnd what about Mr. Kudo?\nArmstrong:\nLa old man chocked on some bird seed z'at got stuck in 'is throat.\nJudge:\nHmm... It seems we now have yet another incident on our hands.Armstrong:\nIt was approximately 5 minutes later z'at la poisoning incident occurred.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd what were you doing at that point? Without any customers, you must have had time to kill.\nArmstrong:\nI am multi-talented woman, monsieur!\nPhoenix:\nSorry? What do you mean?\nArmstrong:\nZ'ere is la renowned chef, Jean Armstrong, and la tragic poet, Claurice Armstrong.\nJudge:\nC-C-Claurice...?\nArmstrong:\nOui. I was writing a poem. An angry tale of a chef in 'alf a million dollars of debt... ...cooking for a man who won 'alf a million dollars on la lottery! It is called, \"Pourquoi\". It means, \"Why\". Per'aps I could recite it for la court?\nPhoenix:\nPlease don't...Present Millionaire Radio Flyer (after changing second statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I'm afraid I've finally got you, Mr. Armstrong.\"Armstrong:\nNon, z'ere was no time for a phony to do la acting.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou mean you contacted the police as soon as the incident occurred?\nArmstrong:\nI asked la old man to call from la pay phone.\nGodot:\nBy your own argument, Trite... ...the purpose of this \"phony victim's\" performance was so the old man would see it. In other words... ...once the incident occurred, this opportunity would completely disappear.\nJudge:\nIndeed.\nArmstrong:\nBien. It seems la shadow of doubt 'as been lifted, n'est-ce pas?\nPhoenix:\n...Present Millionaire Radio Flyer (after changing second statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I'm afraid I've finally got you, Mr. Armstrong.\"Maya:\nI guess Mr. Armstrong is connected to this case, huh?Phoenix:\nAbsolutely. Someone was impersonating Mr. Elg, and I refuse to believe he was oblivious. He was there the whole time, after all.Maya:\nBut if you're right, wouldn't Maggey have noticed, too?Phoenix:\nShe fell unconscious when the incident occurred, remember?Maya:\nAh! You mean that's when the phony staged his act?Phoenix:\nWe'll know for sure once I find a hole in this testimony.Phoenix:\nI'm afraid I've finally got you, Mr. Armstrong.Armstrong:\nQ-Quoi? What do you mean?Phoenix:\nAt the time in question, the victim was listening to the radio with his earpiece. The show he was listening to was \"Millionaire Radio\". Each week, they announce the winning number of a half million dollar lottery ticket.Armstrong:\nOui. Z'at must be la show Mon. Elg was listening to.Judge:\nI can't see any problem with this testimony, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nI wonder...Armstrong:\n...?Phoenix:\nYou say the victim arrived at your restaurant after 2 PM, correct?Armstrong:\nOui, oui. I am sure of it. I remember it perfectly now! I know it was z'at time, because I 'ad just finished serving la lunch menu.Godot:\nGet to the point, Trite. If you have one.Phoenix:\nThat show is broadcast live at 1:30 PM. And it claims to be \"the most thrilling 10 minutes of your life\"...Judge:\nI-It's on the air at 1:30!?Phoenix:\nNow, supposedly, the victim made some noise when it was announced that he had won. And yet... I don't believe his cry of joy could have occurred after 2 PM! Because the show had already finished more than 30 minutes earlier by that point in time!Armstrong:\nNooooooooon!Phoenix:\nThis \"victim\" we've been told about has done nothing but the impossible! Listening to the radio with a ruptured eardrum, catching a show that was already over... There is only one conclusion you can draw from these facts! This \"victim\" was an imposter, acting out the poisoning 30 minutes after the real murder! Yes, there were two Glen Elgs in Tr\u00e9s Bien that day. The real Glen Elg, now dead, having been poisoned by the real killer... ...and the phony Glen Elg, acting out the events for Mr. Kudo to witness!Judge:\nI-It certainly seems that way... I mean, if that wasn't the case, how could you explain the time discrepancy?Godot:Godot:\nQuite a performance, Trite. You were almost on a roll.Phoenix:\n...!Godot:\nBut sadly, you lack the rock hard foundation of rhythm to build your song!Phoenix:\n(...What is this? Music Theory 101?)Godot:\nLet's recap. According to your \"imaginative\" theory, it's now just after 2 PM... The phony Elg is performing a play for the benefit of Mr. Kudo. How do you explain then, where the real Glen Elg is!?Phoenix:\nI don't believe I have to spell this out for court! However! At that time, the real Glen Elg was already dead!Judge:\nThat's certainly the obvious conclusion.Godot:Godot:\nThank you, Trite. That's exactly what I was hoping you would say.Phoenix:\nWh-What!?Godot:\nNow, I presume you can prove this theory of yours...? Can you explain where the missing corpse went to!?Phoenix:\nTh-The missing corpse...?Godot:\nAccording to the old man's testimony, there was only one other customer there. If that \"customer\" was the phony Glen Elg... ...then where did the killer hide the body of the real victim!?Phoenix:\nNaaaaaargh!Judge:\nThe prosecution has a valid point, Mr. Wright. If your theory is to stand up to examination by the court... ...you must provide us with proof by answering the prosecution's question. Where did the killer hide the body?Phoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor...Godot:\nNo conjecture, Trite. Let's hear some facts for once. Show the court a piece of evidence that proves where the body was hidden!Phoenix:\nE-Evidence!?Maya:\nWh-What's with the intense pressure in here all of a sudden!?Phoenix:\n(I thought I had him with that contradiction. But he's turned it all around and backed me into a corner instead!)Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? The court will now hear the defense's theory and evidence. First, where was the body of the real Mr. Elg concealed?Outside Tr\u00e9s Bien\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nClearly, there's no place to hide a body inside Tr\u00e9s Bien. Therefore, the killer must have hauled the body outside!\nJudge:\nHmm... I see.\nGodot:\nNice supposition. But the real question is, \"Can you back it up?\" Where's the evidence that proves the body was hidden in that location!?\n\n\n\nPresent anything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nGodot:\nToo bad... I don't think you'll ever grasp the real heart of Rock'n'Roll.\nPhoenix:\nWhat are you talking about?\nJudge:\nHe means that your evidence is irrelevant, Mr. Wright!\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! You've got to think it through! Feel the beat! And then hit him with some heavy metal!\nPhoenix:\n(OK, I need to calm down and get my facts straight. What should I do now?)\n\n\n\nStart over\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI-I think I need to clear my head...\nGodot:\nHa...! I'd say it's already empty, Trite!\nJudge:\nI'm inclined to agree.\nArmstrong:\nYo tambi\u00e9n.\nPhoenix:\n(What's with the Spanish all of a sudden!?)\nLeads back to:\n\"Well, Mr. Wright? The court will now hear the defense's theory and evidence.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent more evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(There's nothing wrong with my logic so far, I'm sure of it! I'll hit them with another piece of evidence and see if that helps...)\nLeads back to:\n\"Clearly, there's no place to hide a body inside Tr\u00e9s Bien.\"Inside Tr\u00e9s Bien\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt'd would [sic] have been too dangerous to take the body outside. Obviously, the body must have been hidden somewhere inside Tr\u00e9s Bien.\nJudge:\nHmm... Interesting... But where could a body have been hidden inside a restaurant? Perhaps you would care to show the court on these plans, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. The exact location where the body was concealed inside Tr\u00e9s Bien is...\n\n\n\nPresent anywhere\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe body was hidden here!\nJudge:\nHmm... I see.\nGodot:\nNice supposition. But the real question is, \"Can you back it up?\" Where's the evidence that proves the body was hidden in that location!?\n\n\n\nPresent Small Bottle (after presenting Kitchen)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Armstrong! Do you recognize this bottle?\"\n\n\n\n\nOtherwise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nGodot:\nToo bad... I don't think you'll ever grasp the real heart of Rock'n'Roll.\nPhoenix:\nWhat are you talking about?\nJudge:\nHe means that your evidence is irrelevant, Mr. Wright!\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! You've got to think it through! Feel the beat! And then hit him with some heavy metal!\nPhoenix:\n(OK, I need to calm down and get my facts straight. What should I do now?)\n\n\n\nStart over\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI-I think I need to clear my head...\nGodot:\nHa...! I'd say it's already empty, Trite!\nJudge:\nI'm inclined to agree.\nArmstrong:\nYo tambi\u00e9n.\nPhoenix:\n(What's with the Spanish all of a sudden!?)\nLeads back to:\n\"Well, Mr. Wright? The court will now hear the defense's theory and evidence.\"\n\n\n\n\nPick another location\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(There's nothing wrong with my logic so far, I'm sure of it! I'll have another go at proving where the body was hidden.)\nLeads back to:\n\"It'd would have been too dangerous to take the body outside.\"Phoenix:\nMr. Armstrong! Do you recognize this bottle?Armstrong:\nNon! Non, non, non! I 'ave never seen z'at ugly bottle before in my life! I only use la very best bottles, monsieur! Z'e 'ighest quality only for me!Judge:\nWhere was that bottle found, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nInterestingly enough, Your Honor. it was found in the kitchen of Tr\u00e9s Bien.Armstrong:\nEh? Quoi!? But I only ever use z'ese bottles for my aromatherapy oils.Phoenix:\nBut this bottle doesn't contain aromatherapy oil, Mr. Armstrong. No, it contains a medication.Judge:\nWhat kind of medication?Phoenix:\nI'm sure everyone remembers, don't they? That Mr. Elg visited an otolaryngological clinic, and was given medication that day!Godot:\nY-You can't be serious...Phoenix:\nThe defense had the contents of the bottle analyzed, and I have the lab results here! The contents of the bottle match the prescription that was given to Mr. Elg!Godot:\nBwooooar!Phoenix:\nGlen Elg's murderer hid the body in the restaurant kitchen. At which time, this bottle fell out of the victim's pocket. Mr. Armstrong! When the incident occurred, didn't you say you were in the kitchen?Armstrong:\nM-M-Mon dieu!Phoenix:\nYes, you know about what I'm about to say, It was YOU who hid the victim's body! You did a fine job pretending to defend my client, Maggey Byrde. However! You were setting her up to take the fall behind the poor girl's back!Armstrong:\nNooooooooon!Judge:\nO-Order! Order! This is an extraordinary development. Witness! Did you... Did you murder Mr. Glen Elg?Armstrong:\nNever! I could not do such an 'orrible thing!Godot:\nNoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!Judge:\nM-Mr. Godot!?Godot:\n...The bitterness... Every time I get lied to, I always down a mug of coffee. ...That's one of my rules.Phoenix:\n(Do you have the slightest idea how many cups you've had by now...?)Godot:\nThen I like to do the same to the person who lied to me. I like to take them down with my empty cup! Listen up, chef! How about a brand new flavor in your ear, my \"h\" deficient friend?Armstrong:\nJe vous demande pardon! Please, you must 'ear me out! It is a trap! Listen to me! Por favor!Judge:\nYo hablo Espa\u00f1ol, Mr. Armstrong, and \"Por favor\" is Spanish.Godot:\nI'm only going to ask you once. Did you do it?Armstrong:\nNon! Non, non! Absolutely non! I simply... I...Godot:\nLet's hear it. You've got one shot. Right, gramps?Judge:\nWitness! The court will permit you the chance to make one final statement. If you lie under oath again, Mr. Godot's coffee mug awaits you... As does my gavel!Armstrong:\nO-Oui... It is clear.Phoenix:\n(What do they always say in the movies...? \"I've got a bad feeling about this...\"?)Judge:\nVery well! Begin your final testimony, Mr. Armstrong!Witness Testimony-- The Confession --Armstrong:\nIt is true, I 'id la body in la kitchen.\nA man forced me to do it. I 'ad no choice.\nI 'ad to go along w'iz 'im because... Z'ere was a reason why I could not refuse.\nBut I did not kill 'im! I swear it! You must believe me!Judge:\nYou were \"forced\"? By who!?Armstrong:\nI-I cannot say! Or I will be... erased!Phoenix:\nLet's try a different question then. When Mr. Elg died, was he really the only person at his table?Armstrong:\n... Z'ere was... Z'ere was another man.Phoenix:\n(I knew it!)Maya:\nMaggey was telling the truth!Judge:\nYou may cross-examine the witness now, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\n(There's just one more thing I need to do. I gotta break this guy, and get him to tell us the name of the real killer.)Cross Examination",

I saw 'im from la kitchen.\nPhoenix:\nYet the defendant, Ms. Byrde, remembers it differently. She swears there was another man at the victim's table.\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHa...! Unfortunately for you, Trite... ...yesterday's witness also testified that the victim was alone.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nYou know, seeing you squirm like that reminds me... ...of a certain coffee's bitter-sweet bite.\nPhoenix:\n(What kind of coffee has he been drinking!?)\nMaya:\nIt's not coffee, it's love! It's love that's bitter-sweet.\nPhoenix:\n(Hearing Maya say that makes her seem wise all of a sudden...)Armstrong:\nI remember la old man arrived not long after 'im.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBy old man, you mean Victor Kudo, correct?\nArmstrong:\nOui. 'E comes often for my special coffee.\nGodot:\nI drank your coffee once, Mr. Armstrong. It's special, I'll give you that. It's worth a sip just for the experience.\nArmstrong:\nOh, you make me so 'appy, monsieur! You are most welcome any time!\nGodot:\nI said it was worth one sip, and nothing more.\nPhoenix:\n(So old Mr. Kudo arrived at the restaurant around the same time as the victim. Maybe I should ask about his arrival in more detail.)\n\n\n\nDon't ask anything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(All I need to do is establish that this phony victim really existed. Asking more about the old man is only going to cloud the issue.) I think that's enough about coffee. Please continue with your testimony, Mr. Armstrong.\nArmstrong:\nYou are welcome any time too, Monsieur Wright. I'll brew something special for you!\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nHow many minutes after?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you're saying that not much time elapsed between when the victim and Mr. Kudo arrived?\nArmstrong:\nOui. Z'at is correct.\nPhoenix:\n(But that still leaves the possibility that something happened in that gap of time.) And by your recollection, how much time would you say elapsed?\nArmstrong:\nLet me see... Approximately 2 minutes, I would say.\nPhoenix:\nT-Two minutes!? That's all?\nJudge:\nHmm... It seems unlikely that anything untoward could have happened in such a short time.\nPhoenix:\n(Rats! I knew I shouldn't have pursued this line of questioning...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nWhat time is it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOut of curiosity, about what time was it when Mr. Kudo arrived?\nArmstrong:\nOh, no... I cannot remember, monsieur.\nJudge:\nHmm... I believe we were told by a witness yesterday...\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThe crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.\n\n\nJudge:\nDoes that perhaps jog your memory, witness?\nArmstrong:\nLa incident 'appened about 20 minutes after 'e arrived. So the victim must 'ave arrived between 2:00 PM and 2:10 PM, non?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Just after 2, huh...)\nArmstrong:\nThank you for your 'elp, in jogging my memory, monsieur. You are wonderful!\nJudge:\nHah hah hah! I can't sit here all the time and do nothing now, can I!? The time of day will be added to the witness's testimony.\nArmstrong:\nOui, Monsieur Judge. Everything I do, I do it for you!\nJudge:\nMerci bien. That's French, isn't it? Hah hah hah!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm glad at least one person is in a good mood...)\nMaya:\nH-He's even humming a song to himself...!\nChanges statement from \"I remember la old man arrived not long after 'im.\" to \"I remember la old man arrived not long after 'im, just after 2 PM.\"Armstrong:\nI remember la old man arrived not long after 'im, just after 2 PM.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely sure about the time?\nArmstrong:\nWhen I think really 'ard, 1 am sure it was just after 2. Oui. It is la time I stop serving la lunch menu.\nJudge:\nQuite right. I always break for lunch when the restaurants are serving their specials. I've been known to wind up a case early just to make it on time! Hah hah!\nPhoenix:\n(I guess you should never get between a hungry judge and his lunch...)\nJudge:\nOh, would you look at that! It's almost lunchtime already.\nPhoenix:\nWitness! Get on with your testimony, please!Present Millionaire Radio Flyer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I'm afraid I've finally got you, Mr. Armstrong.\"Armstrong:\nZ'ere were no other customers.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo your only customers were Mr. Kudo and the victim?\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHow many times do you need to ask the same thing, Trite? You'd never catch me drinking the same blend twice!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGodot:\nYou're trying to establish the presence of a \"phony victim\" in the restaurant. But you're wasting your time. You can't grind bird seed to make coffee, if you catch my drift...\nPhoenix:\n(But there's a hole in this testimony somewhere! I'm sure of it!)Armstrong:\nWhen 'e got word 'e won la lottery, Mon. Elg became very excited.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid you see him?\nArmstrong:\nNon, I was in ze kitchen. But I 'eard 'im. I remember 'im shouting, \"Yes! 'Alf a million bucks!\"\nGodot:\nPresumably the defendant heard that too, then, correct?\nArmstrong:\nMaggey...? She looked like a poor little frightened dove!\nPhoenix:\nAnd what about Mr. Kudo?\nArmstrong:\nLa old man chocked on some bird seed z'at got stuck in 'is throat.\nJudge:\nHmm... It seems we now have yet another incident on our hands.Armstrong:\nIt was approximately 5 minutes later z'at la poisoning incident occurred.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd what were you doing at that point? Without any customers, you must have had time to kill.\nArmstrong:\nI am multi-talented woman, monsieur!\nPhoenix:\nSorry? What do you mean?\nArmstrong:\nZ'ere is la renowned chef, Jean Armstrong, and la tragic poet, Claurice Armstrong.\nJudge:\nC-C-Claurice...?\nArmstrong:\nOui. I was writing a poem. An angry tale of a chef in 'alf a million dollars of debt... ...cooking for a man who won 'alf a million dollars on la lottery! It is called, \"Pourquoi\". It means, \"Why\". Per'aps I could recite it for la court?\nPhoenix:\nPlease don't...Present Millionaire Radio Flyer (after changing second statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I'm afraid I've finally got you, Mr. Armstrong.\"Armstrong:\nNon, z'ere was no time for a phony to do la acting.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou mean you contacted the police as soon as the incident occurred?\nArmstrong:\nI asked la old man to call from la pay phone.\nGodot:\nBy your own argument, Trite... ...the purpose of this \"phony victim's\" performance was so the old man would see it. In other words... ...once the incident occurred, this opportunity would completely disappear.\nJudge:\nIndeed.\nArmstrong:\nBien. It seems la shadow of doubt 'as been lifted, n'est-ce pas?\nPhoenix:\n...Present Millionaire Radio Flyer (after changing second statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I'm afraid I've finally got you, Mr. Armstrong.\"Maya:\nI guess Mr. Armstrong is connected to this case, huh?Phoenix:\nAbsolutely. Someone was impersonating Mr. Elg, and I refuse to believe he was oblivious. He was there the whole time, after all.Maya:\nBut if you're right, wouldn't Maggey have noticed, too?Phoenix:\nShe fell unconscious when the incident occurred, remember?Maya:\nAh! You mean that's when the phony staged his act?Phoenix:\nWe'll know for sure once I find a hole in this testimony.Phoenix:\nI'm afraid I've finally got you, Mr. Armstrong.Armstrong:\nQ-Quoi? What do you mean?Phoenix:\nAt the time in question, the victim was listening to the radio with his earpiece. The show he was listening to was \"Millionaire Radio\". Each week, they announce the winning number of a half million dollar lottery ticket.Armstrong:\nOui. Z'at must be la show Mon. Elg was listening to.Judge:\nI can't see any problem with this testimony, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nI wonder...Armstrong:\n...?Phoenix:\nYou say the victim arrived at your restaurant after 2 PM, correct?Armstrong:\nOui, oui. I am sure of it. I remember it perfectly now! I know it was z'at time, because I 'ad just finished serving la lunch menu.Godot:\nGet to the point, Trite. If you have one.Phoenix:\nThat show is broadcast live at 1:30 PM. And it claims to be \"the most thrilling 10 minutes of your life\"...Judge:\nI-It's on the air at 1:30!?Phoenix:\nNow, supposedly, the victim made some noise when it was announced that he had won. And yet... I don't believe his cry of joy could have occurred after 2 PM! Because the show had already finished more than 30 minutes earlier by that point in time!Armstrong:\nNooooooooon!Phoenix:\nThis \"victim\" we've been told about has done nothing but the impossible! Listening to the radio with a ruptured eardrum, catching a show that was already over... There is only one conclusion you can draw from these facts! This \"victim\" was an imposter, acting out the poisoning 30 minutes after the real murder! Yes, there were two Glen Elgs in Tr\u00e9s Bien that day. The real Glen Elg, now dead, having been poisoned by the real killer... ...and the phony Glen Elg, acting out the events for Mr. Kudo to witness!Judge:\nI-It certainly seems that way... I mean, if that wasn't the case, how could you explain the time discrepancy?Godot:Godot:\nQuite a performance, Trite. You were almost on a roll.Phoenix:\n...!Godot:\nBut sadly, you lack the rock hard foundation of rhythm to build your song!Phoenix:\n(...What is this? Music Theory 101?)Godot:\nLet's recap. According to your \"imaginative\" theory, it's now just after 2 PM... The phony Elg is performing a play for the benefit of Mr. Kudo. How do you explain then, where the real Glen Elg is!?Phoenix:\nI don't believe I have to spell this out for court! However! At that time, the real Glen Elg was already dead!Judge:\nThat's certainly the obvious conclusion.Godot:Godot:\nThank you, Trite. That's exactly what I was hoping you would say.Phoenix:\nWh-What!?Godot:\nNow, I presume you can prove this theory of yours...? Can you explain where the missing corpse went to!?Phoenix:\nTh-The missing corpse...?Godot:\nAccording to the old man's testimony, there was only one other customer there. If that \"customer\" was the phony Glen Elg... ...then where did the killer hide the body of the real victim!?Phoenix:\nNaaaaaargh!Judge:\nThe prosecution has a valid point, Mr. Wright. If your theory is to stand up to examination by the court... ...you must provide us with proof by answering the prosecution's question. Where did the killer hide the body?Phoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor...Godot:\nNo conjecture, Trite. Let's hear some facts for once. Show the court a piece of evidence that proves where the body was hidden!Phoenix:\nE-Evidence!?Maya:\nWh-What's with the intense pressure in here all of a sudden!?Phoenix:\n(I thought I had him with that contradiction. But he's turned it all around and backed me into a corner instead!)Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? The court will now hear the defense's theory and evidence. First, where was the body of the real Mr. Elg concealed?Outside Tr\u00e9s Bien\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nClearly, there's no place to hide a body inside Tr\u00e9s Bien. Therefore, the killer must have hauled the body outside!\nJudge:\nHmm... I see.\nGodot:\nNice supposition. But the real question is, \"Can you back it up?\" Where's the evidence that proves the body was hidden in that location!?\n\n\n\nPresent anything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nGodot:\nToo bad... I don't think you'll ever grasp the real heart of Rock'n'Roll.\nPhoenix:\nWhat are you talking about?\nJudge:\nHe means that your evidence is irrelevant, Mr. Wright!\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! You've got to think it through! Feel the beat! And then hit him with some heavy metal!\nPhoenix:\n(OK, I need to calm down and get my facts straight. What should I do now?)\n\n\n\nStart over\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI-I think I need to clear my head...\nGodot:\nHa...! I'd say it's already empty, Trite!\nJudge:\nI'm inclined to agree.\nArmstrong:\nYo tambi\u00e9n.\nPhoenix:\n(What's with the Spanish all of a sudden!?)\nLeads back to:\n\"Well, Mr. Wright? The court will now hear the defense's theory and evidence.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent more evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(There's nothing wrong with my logic so far, I'm sure of it! I'll hit them with another piece of evidence and see if that helps...)\nLeads back to:\n\"Clearly, there's no place to hide a body inside Tr\u00e9s Bien.\"Inside Tr\u00e9s Bien\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt'd would [sic] have been too dangerous to take the body outside. Obviously, the body must have been hidden somewhere inside Tr\u00e9s Bien.\nJudge:\nHmm... Interesting... But where could a body have been hidden inside a restaurant? Perhaps you would care to show the court on these plans, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. The exact location where the body was concealed inside Tr\u00e9s Bien is...\n\n\n\nPresent anywhere\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe body was hidden here!\nJudge:\nHmm... I see.\nGodot:\nNice supposition. But the real question is, \"Can you back it up?\" Where's the evidence that proves the body was hidden in that location!?\n\n\n\nPresent Small Bottle (after presenting Kitchen)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Armstrong! Do you recognize this bottle?\"\n\n\n\n\nOtherwise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nGodot:\nToo bad... I don't think you'll ever grasp the real heart of Rock'n'Roll.\nPhoenix:\nWhat are you talking about?\nJudge:\nHe means that your evidence is irrelevant, Mr. Wright!\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! You've got to think it through! Feel the beat! And then hit him with some heavy metal!\nPhoenix:\n(OK, I need to calm down and get my facts straight. What should I do now?)\n\n\n\nStart over\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI-I think I need to clear my head...\nGodot:\nHa...! I'd say it's already empty, Trite!\nJudge:\nI'm inclined to agree.\nArmstrong:\nYo tambi\u00e9n.\nPhoenix:\n(What's with the Spanish all of a sudden!?)\nLeads back to:\n\"Well, Mr. Wright? The court will now hear the defense's theory and evidence.\"\n\n\n\n\nPick another location\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(There's nothing wrong with my logic so far, I'm sure of it! I'll have another go at proving where the body was hidden.)\nLeads back to:\n\"It'd would have been too dangerous to take the body outside.\"Phoenix:\nMr. Armstrong! Do you recognize this bottle?Armstrong:\nNon! Non, non, non! I 'ave never seen z'at ugly bottle before in my life! I only use la very best bottles, monsieur! Z'e 'ighest quality only for me!Judge:\nWhere was that bottle found, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nInterestingly enough, Your Honor. it was found in the kitchen of Tr\u00e9s Bien.Armstrong:\nEh? Quoi!? But I only ever use z'ese bottles for my aromatherapy oils.Phoenix:\nBut this bottle doesn't contain aromatherapy oil, Mr. Armstrong. No, it contains a medication.Judge:\nWhat kind of medication?Phoenix:\nI'm sure everyone remembers, don't they? That Mr. Elg visited an otolaryngological clinic, and was given medication that day!Godot:\nY-You can't be serious...Phoenix:\nThe defense had the contents of the bottle analyzed, and I have the lab results here! The contents of the bottle match the prescription that was given to Mr. Elg!Godot:\nBwooooar!Phoenix:\nGlen Elg's murderer hid the body in the restaurant kitchen. At which time, this bottle fell out of the victim's pocket. Mr. Armstrong! When the incident occurred, didn't you say you were in the kitchen?Armstrong:\nM-M-Mon dieu!Phoenix:\nYes, you know about what I'm about to say, It was YOU who hid the victim's body! You did a fine job pretending to defend my client, Maggey Byrde. However! You were setting her up to take the fall behind the poor girl's back!Armstrong:\nNooooooooon!Judge:\nO-Order! Order! This is an extraordinary development. Witness! Did you... Did you murder Mr. Glen Elg?Armstrong:\nNever! I could not do such an 'orrible thing!Godot:\nNoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!Judge:\nM-Mr. Godot!?Godot:\n...The bitterness... Every time I get lied to, I always down a mug of coffee. ...That's one of my rules.Phoenix:\n(Do you have the slightest idea how many cups you've had by now...?)Godot:\nThen I like to do the same to the person who lied to me. I like to take them down with my empty cup! Listen up, chef! How about a brand new flavor in your ear, my \"h\" deficient friend?Armstrong:\nJe vous demande pardon! Please, you must 'ear me out! It is a trap! Listen to me! Por favor!Judge:\nYo hablo Espa\u00f1ol, Mr. Armstrong, and \"Por favor\" is Spanish.Godot:\nI'm only going to ask you once. Did you do it?Armstrong:\nNon! Non, non! Absolutely non! I simply... I...Godot:\nLet's hear it. You've got one shot. Right, gramps?Judge:\nWitness! The court will permit you the chance to make one final statement. If you lie under oath again, Mr. Godot's coffee mug awaits you... As does my gavel!Armstrong:\nO-Oui... It is clear.Phoenix:\n(What do they always say in the movies...? \"I've got a bad feeling about this...\"?)Judge:\nVery well! Begin your final testimony, Mr. Armstrong!Witness Testimony-- The Confession --Armstrong:\nIt is true, I 'id la body in la kitchen.\nA man forced me to do it. I 'ad no choice.\nI 'ad to go along w'iz 'im because... Z'ere was a reason why I could not refuse.\nBut I did not kill 'im! I swear it! You must believe me!Judge:\nYou were \"forced\"? By who!?Armstrong:\nI-I cannot say! Or I will be... erased!Phoenix:\nLet's try a different question then. When Mr. Elg died, was he really the only person at his table?Armstrong:\n... Z'ere was... Z'ere was another man.Phoenix:\n(I knew it!)Maya:\nMaggey was telling the truth!Judge:\nYou may cross-examine the witness now, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\n(There's just one more thing I need to do. I gotta break this guy, and get him to tell us the name of the real killer.)Cross Examination",

Yesterday's session didn't go so well, and then ended on a giant mystery.Phoenix:\n(That's true... And we still haven't solved a single part of it yet...)Maya:\nAre you OK, Nick?Phoenix:\nHuh? Oh, uh... Yeah. Of course.Byrde:\nI saw that! That little flash of doubt in your eyes!Phoenix:\nN-No! That wasn't doubt. That was, umm... determination!Byrde:\nWhy don't I believe you...?Maya:\nIt's nearly time, Maggey. You'd better get going to the defendant's seat.Byrde:\nRoger. Don't let me down, Mr. Wright. I'm counting on you!Hey, pal!Phoenix:\nHey, Detective Gumshoe...Gumshoe:\nQuit stressing Maggey out! She doesn't need that!Phoenix:\nH-How did you know she was stressed...?Gumshoe:\nI was watching through the doorway.Phoenix:\nOh...Gumshoe:\nYou look like you lost the case already. Show a bit of confidence, will you, pal!? Here, maybe this'll help.Maya:\nHuh!? Have you taken up aromatherapy, too?Gumshoe:\nNot in a million years, pal! Don't tell me that you don't remember this thing?Phoenix:\n(Hmm... Come to think of it, that doesn't look like one of those aromatherapy bottles...)Gumshoe:\nThis is the small bottle that turned up in Tr\u00e9s Bien's kitchen a couple of days ago.Maya:\nWow! Look at all these little bottles!Phoenix:\nOh! They're aromatherapy oils! He's got so many, they're overflowing onto the floor...Maya:\nHey, wait a minute... There's one bottle that's different from all the others.Phoenix:\nWell what do you know. And it doesn't have a label either.Maya:\nAnd... *sniff* It doesn't smell.Gumshoe:\nWe finally got the analysis results back from the lab.Maya:\nSo!? What is it? Is it the poison?Gumshoe:\nI'm afraid not, pal. It's... medication.Maya:\nMedication?Gumshoe:\nYeah. For ears. Topical use only, apparently.Phoenix:\nFor ears? You mean...?Gumshoe:\nYeah. It's the medication Glen Elg was using for his ruptured eardrum!Phoenix:\n(What was Glen Elg's ear medicine doing in the kitchen...?)Small Bottle refiled into the Court Record.Phoenix:\nUm, what about the unidentified fingerprints? Anything on that?Gumshoe:\nSomeone screwed up, so they only had time to analyze the contents of the bottle. Another hour and they might have gotten something on the prints, but...Phoenix:\n(Hmm... That's going to weaken its impact as a piece of evidence...)Gumshoe:\nOK, pal! This is it! Make sure your defense is impregnable today, got it!?Phoenix:\n(Today's trial... I'm gonna expose that guy for what he's done, or my name isn't Phoenix Wright!)January 8, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Maggey Byrde.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Godot:\nReady and waiting as always, Your Honor.Judge:\nVery good. Then we'll get underway at once. Yesterday we heard the testimony of Mr. Victor Kudo. He claims to have witnessed the defendant putting a powder into the victim's coffee. However, the witness's testimony was plagued with a number of problems.Godot:\nThe mark on the rim of the cup shows that the victim drank from it with his right hand. But according to the old man's testimony, he picked it up with his left hand.Judge:\nThank you, Mr. Godot. Furthermore, according to the witness's account... ...the victim was listening to the radio with an earpiece in his left ear. Yet, the victim's left eardrum was ruptured, which made him effectively deaf in that ear.Maya:\nIt's amazing how many contradictions a single case can have, huh Nick?Godot:\nHa...! Allow me to enlighten you, Your Honor. The world, you see, keeps turning, and we must turn with it.Judge:\n... You've lost me already, Mr. Godot.Godot:\nDon't let the mysteries of yesterday mystify you today. Only losers think like that. You've got to change with the times! That's one of my rules!Judge:\nAre you implying that you've resolved these contradictions? You know the answers to these riddles!?Godot:\nThe old guy wasn't just throwing seed in here. He was throwing us off the scent. And today I'll prove it.Judge:\nVery well. Let the first witness take the stand!Godot:\nAnd you are?Armstrong:\nOh bonjour, everyone! I am Jean Armstrong. z'e owner and 'ead chef of la Tr\u00e9s Bien restaurant. Enchant\u00e9!.........Judge:\nForgive me for asking, witness, but... are you a woman?Armstrong:\nOh l\u00e0 l\u00e0, monsieur! As you can see, I am la pert and perky gentleman, non?Judge:\nEr... Umm...Godot:\nOn the day of the incident, you were in Tr\u00e9s Bien's kitchen. Isn't that right?Armstrong:\nW'iz you monsieur...Godot:\n...?Armstrong:\n...everything feels right!Godot:\nHa...!Phoenix:\n(Wow, he's totally unfazed! Doesn't anything intimidate this guy...?)Judge:\nVery well. Your testimony please, witness. Please tell the court what happened that day at Tr\u00e9s Bien.Armstrong:\nOui! Volontiers!Witness Testimony-- At Tr\u00e9s Bien --Armstrong:\nWhen it all 'appened, z'ere were just two customers in my restaurant.\nI remember I was experimenting w'iz some new art deco z'at day.\nLike 'aving a large mirror between la tables, for example.\nOui! Per'aps z'at is what la old man was looking at.\nLa cup, la earpiece, and la glasses... 'E would 'ave seen everyz'ing in reverse, non?Phoenix:\nA m...m...m... MIRROR!?Armstrong:\nOui! Un grand mirror! La most enormous mirror!Godot:\nAnd suddenly, the mystery disappears! Like I said, the world keeps turning, so roll with it!Judge:\nHmm... That would explain the coffee cup and the earpiece conundrum... The mirror would have made everything appear back to front.Phoenix:\n(What the heck!? It's way too early in the morning for this to be happening to me!)Judge:\nNow then, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- At Tr\u00e9s Bien --Armstrong:\nWhen it all 'appened, z'ere were just two customers in my restaurant.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd who were the two customers, exactly?\nArmstrong:\nMais, of course. La young man who died... ...and la other, not-so-young, man.\nJudge:\nHmm... You are referring to yesterday's witness, I presume?\nPhoenix:\n(What about the other man Maggey says she saw at the table? Something tells me Mr. Armstrong isn't planning to disclose his existence...)\nMaya:\nWe need some hard evidence first before we can bring him up, don't we...?\nPhoenix:\nI guess I'll just have to try a different approach for the time being.Armstrong:\nI remember I was experimenting w'iz some new art deco z'at day.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou were experimenting with art deco? How come I never heard about that before today?\nArmstrong:\nYou are not familiar w'iz z'e language of interior design, monsieur?\nPhoenix:\nPlease stay on topic! Now, why didn't you tell the court about this before!?\nArmstrong:\nBut I did. Just a few moments ago!\nJudge:\nAhem! Excuse me, Mr. Armstrong. This \"deco\" you mentioned... Are you referring to some sort of \"decocture\"?\nPhoenix:\nNo, no! Art deco, it is a style of design! ...Your Honor. He's talking about interior design. Walls, ceilings, carpets, that kind of thing.\nJudge:\nAh, yes. Of course. That \"deco\".\nArmstrong:\nI was trying to achieve a more \"la effeminate\" look for my restaurant. I was planning z'e most bold remodeling of la decor.Armstrong:\nLike 'aving a large mirror between la tables, for example.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow big of a mirror are we talking about here?\nArmstrong:\nBof! Something about 4 meters wide and, err... Oui. About 2 meters 'igh.\nPhoenix:\n(Let's see... If 1 meter is about 1 yard... Holy glass in a frame, that's huge!)\nArmstrong:\nI was intending to install it on la ceiling eventually.\nPhoenix:\nThe ceiling!? (Was there a mirror on the ceiling!? I don't remember...)\nArmstrong:\nMais, non. But I decided not to go through w'iz it in z'e end.\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I ask him more about the mirror or not?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(He couldn't lie about such a huge object like that. It must've been there in the restaurant somewhere.)\nGodot:\n...\nLeads to:\n\"Hmm... So the witness yesterday had seen the victim reflected in a mirror...\"\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIf you really had such a large mirror in the restaurant, someone would have noticed it! But there's nothing about a mirror in Mr. Kudo or Maggey Byrde's testimonies!\nArmstrong:\nB-But...\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nYou didn't ask, Trite. You have only yourself to blame for such sloppy work.\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nGodot:\nA mirror was delivered to Tr\u00e9s Bien the day before the incident.\nPhoenix:\nR-Really?\nGodot:\nAs Mr. Armstrong testified, he was carrying out some design changes. And as it turned out, he didn't actually use the mirror in the end.\nPhoenix:\n(This just doesn't add up. Even if a mirror was delivered to Tr\u00e9s Bien... ...it doesn't prove that it was in the restaurant on the day of the crime.)\nGodot:\nHa...! If you want to doubt someone, Trite, look in the mirror. I'm sure the person looking back at you will be dubious enough!\nLeads to:\n\"Hmm... So the witness yesterday had seen the victim reflected in a mirror...\"\n\n\nJudge:\nHmm... So the witness yesterday had seen the victim reflected in a mirror...Armstrong:\nOui! Per'aps z'at is what la old man was looking at.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nNormally, I'd expect people to know the difference between a reflection and a real object.\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\n\"Normally\"? How does normality come into this? That's lame, Trite. Even for you.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGodot:\nAre you trying to say that if something isn't normal, it isn't possible? Is that it? Where does that leave the porcu-headed lawyer and the topknot chick over there... and the ungodly cool guy with the mask over here? Well, Trite!?\nPhoenix:\nAaack! Not the hair!\nMaya:\nI do not have a topknot!\nJudge:\nMr. Godot is correct. A lack of normality is no basis for discounting an argument.\nArmstrong:\nBien! Logic 'as won la day!Armstrong:\nLa cup, la earpiece, and la glasses... 'E would 'ave seen everyz'ing in reverse, non?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nEverything? He would have seen everything in reverse?\nArmstrong:\nOui.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick... We should take a sec and think about what Old Seedy said in his testimony...\nPhoenix:\n(How did he phrase it again...?)\n\n\nKudo:\nThe boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs.\n\n\nKudo:\nNo question! You can lock me up if I'm wrong! It was his left ear, without a doubt!\n\n\nKudo:\nAnd then he used the same hand to pick up the cup. His left hand!\n\n\nMaya:\nIf he saw everything he described reflected in a mirror... ...then everything he said he saw on the \"left\" was actually on the \"right\", huh.\nPhoenix:\n(And that clears up all the problems with his testimony, I guess... Or does it...?)\nGodot:\nHa...!Present Glen Elg profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The coffee cup, the earpiece, and the HMD...\"Phoenix:\n(It's kinda hard to believe everything's the fault of a mirror, but...)Maya:\nDo you think Old Seedy saw everything through a reflection...?Phoenix:\nIf he did, it would explain all the contradictions in his testimony.Maya:\nBut that just makes the situation worse for Maggey! There's gotta be something in that old man's testimony! We've just gotta dig deeper!Phoenix:\nThe coffee cup, the earpiece, and the HMD... Let's think back over Mr. Kudo's testimony for a second, shall we?Kudo:\nThe boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs.Kudo:\nNo question! You can lock me up if I'm wrong! It was his left ear, without a doubt!Phoenix:\nSo, to summarize... ...we were told both the HMD and the earpiece were on the victim's left side. Now, if Mr. Kudo saw all that as a reflection in a mirror... ...it means both the HMD and the earpiece were actually on the victim's right side.Armstrong:\nExactement! You see, monsieur. Now z'at you think about it, it is not so 'ard, non?Phoenix:\nUnfortunately, that's where we run into a monumental contradiction with the facts! If Mr. Kudo really did see everything in a mirror... ...why is it that the HMD is now on the wrong side of his head!?Judge:\nOrder! Order! ...Mr. Wright is correct! If the witness genuinely observed the victim reflected in a mirror... ...then we would expect the victim's eyepiece to have been over his right eye.Godot:Godot:\n...How bitter. Trite, you should have a taste of this bitterness. It'll calm you down in no time.Phoenix:\nA-Are we talking about your coffee... or something completely different...?Godot:\nYou don't understand the way the witness thinks.Judge:\nHow he thinks?Godot:\nYou remember this, I presume?Phoenix:\nThe \"I broke the vase... sorry\" apology lett-- I mean Mr. Kudo's sworn testimony?Godot:\nExactly. The old man has one very grievous habit... other than throwing seeds. The more of an impression something makes, the more muddled his mind makes it. And what's the most striking thing about Mr. Elg?Judge:\nClearly, it's the victim's eyepiece.Godot:\nAnd that's my point. The old man strikes again! Mr. Elg's HMD made a big impression on the old man. \"I saw the earpiece and those new-fangled spectacles he was wearing! Oh, yes! They were both on his left ear! Do you hear? His left ear!\" Ha...! Well, Trite?Phoenix:\nUrk... (That's the worst, but best impression of Kudo ever...)Maya:\nWow! I really thought he was Old Seedy for a minute there! Godot's good!Judge:\nEnough! I must agree that yesterday's witness was irresponsibly rash in much of his testimony.Maya:\nBad luck, Nick. Looks like the \"boil\" of a contradiction you found is just a \"rash\".Godot:\nA mirror can't be beaten by a handful of seeds, nor can it lie. So... What exactly was the old man looking at? Fill us in, Mr. Armstrong. Go on, tell the court. We're all ears.Armstrong:\nOui. I can explain. Please, if you will look at la plans of la restaurant.Witness Testimony-- The Mirror --Armstrong:\nAlors. Is everyone sitting comfortably?\nLa mirror, it was in z'e middle of la restaurant, dividing z'e two 'alves.\nZ'ere is only one seat from which you could 'ave seen an image of la victim.\nZ'at was la seat at z'e table next to la victim's. Z'at was where la old man was sitting.\nAfter la terrible incident occurred, I move la mirror so it was not in z'e way.\nBut naturally, I did not touch anything else!Judge:\nHmm... I see no problems with the explanation we have just heard. From the table next to the victim's, Mr. Kudo could have seen the victim in the mirror.Armstrong:\nWhat a naughty little coquette I am, confusing all z'e men like z'is!Godot:\nDon't worry about it. We can keep up, except for the guy breaking out in a cold sweat over there again.Phoenix:\n(Argh! I hate that guy!)Judge:\nYou said you didn't touch anything else apart from the mirror. Are you quite sure about that?Armstrong:\nVolontiers! Of course!Judge:\nVery well. Mr. Wright. Your cross-examination, if you please.Cross Examination-- The Mirror --Armstrong:\nLa mirror, it was in z'e middle of la restaurant, dividing z'e two 'alves.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, run this by me again. The mirror was here, correct?\nArmstrong:\nOui.\nPhoenix:\nOui? Really!? Because I know if I were you, I wouldn't have put a mirror there! It would be in the way!\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nLook who's talking, Trite.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGodot:\nYou're obstructing my view, among other things.\nPhoenix:\nBut, but, but! This is my seat in the courtroom...!\nGodot:\nTr\u00e9s Bien's \"charm\" is that it gives you the impression that you're the only customer. Temporarily placing a mirror in that spot would hardly be \"in the way\". Unlike you... Trite.\nArmstrong:\nI tell you, monsieur. la mirror was z'ere, in z'e middle of la restaurant.Armstrong:\nZ'ere is only one seat from which you could 'ave seen an image of la victim.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd where would that be!?\nArmstrong:\nOh l\u00e1 l\u00e1! Look 'ow you lean towards me! I always attract z'e younger boys! Maybe I should keep you in suspense a little longer!\nJudge:\nMr. Armstrong! Tell the court what you know at once!\nArmstrong:\nI attract z'e older ones, too, you know, 'andsome! Shall I tease you, too!?\nJudge:\nNnngh...\nGodot:\nI'm already seeing a very hot someone, so I'm afraid you'll be waiting for a long time.\nMaya:\nI bet she has mocha-cream skin and cappuccino perfume.\nArmstrong:\nBien. I will tell you... Z'ere was only one seat from which you could 'ave seen...Armstrong:\nZ'at was la seat at z'e table next to la victim's. Z'at was where la old man was sitting.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo why can you only see the victim from that particular seat?\nArmstrong:\nMais, monsieur. It is obvious, non? If you look at la plans you will understand. La victim would 'ave been reflected in la mirror like so. If you were sitting at la table next to 'im, you would see everything, non?\nMaya:\nSo that's the seat Old Seedy was sitting in on that day... ...when the poisoning happened.\nPhoenix:\n(The old man was sitting at the table next to the victim? Why does that seem kinda odd...?)Present Victor's Testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! Mr. Kudo's words yesterday strongly contradict Mr. Armstrong's testimony!\nJudge:\nThis is... the letter of apology that was written by Mr. Kudo, is it not?\nPhoenix:\nI realize it looks useless, Your Honor, but this is still testimony.\nGodot:\nHa...! I guess useless people are only really good at identifying useless things.\nJudge:\nWhat relevance does this scrap of paper have to the trial, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nMr. Kudo's testimony is actually very relevant to the question at hand, Your Honor! Because it very clearly contradicts with this piece of evidence!\n\n\n\nPresent Crime Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThis piece of evidence contradicts with testimony we have heard, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nThe crime photo...?\nPhoenix:\nYes. This photo clearly shows something that theoretically should not exist!\nJudge:\nWhat on Earth do you mean by that, Mr. Wright!?\nGodot:\n\"Should not exist\"? Ha... Sounds like you're describing yourself, Trite.\nJudge:\nNow then, if the defense would please clarify its statement. What is the something that \"should not exist\" in this photo?\n\n\n\nPresent vase on left table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"There is one thing that was clearly demonstrated by yesterday's testimony.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThis is what should not be in the picture!\nJudge:\nI'm sorry?

Exactement. I carried it out of la restaurant z'en.\nPhoenix:\nYou moved a huge mirror like that all by yourself?\nArmstrong:\nWhat can I say? I know 'ow to pick things up, 'andsome!\nPhoenix:\n...\nGodot:\nHeh heh...\nMaya:\nG-Godot actually laughed at something!\nJudge:\nWell, given the witness's physique, I suppose it is possible. Did you move anything else from the crime scene, Mr. Armstrong?\nArmstrong:\nI look like z'e obliging type, non?Armstrong:\nBut naturally, I did not touch anything else!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure about that?\nArmstrong:\nI touched nothing except la mirror!\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright? Is there something the witness has said that doesn't match the crime scene?\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, there is... I just can't put my finger on what exactly.)\nGodot:\nHa...! Suffering from a case of heartburn, Trite?\nArmstrong:\nOh, I 'ave just z'e thing for z'at! An oil with golden myrrh and frankenstaince...\nGodot:\nAdd a few drops to your coffee, and voila! Enjoy.\nPhoenix:\n(Focus, Phoenix. Breathe... I need to ignore those two and just find some evidence.)Present Victor's Testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor!

In the meantime, the witness will repeat his testimony for the court.\nArmstrong:\nOui. I would be delighted!\nLeads back to cross-examinationMaya:\nIt is pretty strange, though, isn't it? I mean, nobody mentioned anything about a really large mirror. You'd think someone would've, but Maggey didn't, and neither did Old Seedy.Phoenix:\nThen the only logical explanation is... ...that there was no mirror inside Tr\u00e9s Bien that day. (Now I've just got to prove it... Somehow...)Phoenix:\nThere is one thing that was clearly demonstrated by yesterday's testimony. Mr. Kudo broke the vase that was on the table where he was sitting. And yet! As the court can see, there is an unbroken vase on the table next to the victim! Why? Because Mr. Kudo was not, in fact, sitting at the table next to the victim at all!Godot:Godot:\nDon't be an idiot, Trite! That's impossible! That seat's the only one Kudo could've seen the victim's reflection from!Phoenix:\nExactly!Godot:\n...!Phoenix:\nThere is only one conclusion we can draw from this contradiction. There was no mirror in Tr\u00e9s Bien that day! Your testimony, Mr. Armstrong, is an elaborate lie!Armstrong:\nMon dieeeeeeeu!Godot:Godot:\nDon't try to confuse the court, Trite! Obviously, the witness cleaned up the vase... ...while the police were taking their time getting to the crime scene!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nUnfortunately, Mr. Godot, that doesn't quite work for me. Mr. Armstrong already testified to the contrary. In his own words... \"I did not touch anything else\" except the mirror!Godot:\nUr... urgh! ... Gaaaaaaaaargh!Judge:\nWell, witness? What do you have to say for yourself?Armstrong:\n*sniffle*Phoenix:\n(I was right! There was no mirror in the restaurant that day!)Judge:\nIn light of this revelation, we return back to the original problem. Why did the victim have an earpiece in an ear in which he couldn't hear?Godot:\nHa...! You only get one shot in life. There's no turning back. If you want to claim that the mirror wasn't there, Trite... ...then this problem is all yours. How do you explain what the old man saw?Phoenix:\n(If I can answer this, then I'll be that much closer to the truth! I can feel it!)Maya:\n...Are you going to be OK? Can you really solve this contradiction, Nick?Phoenix:\nThere's more than just this one contradiction, Maya.Maya:\nWhat do you mean?Phoenix:\nRemember what Maggey told us? \"There was another man at the victim's table.\" And, \"there was a sample CD on the victim's table.\" It all flies in the face of Mr. Kudo's testimony. (And I think I know the reason why nothing in this case is adding up.)Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Let's hear your answer.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. The reason behind all the contradictions in Mr. Kudo's testimony is simple.Mr. Kudo made a mistake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nClearly, Mr. Kudo made a mistake!\nGodot:\nMr. Trite... You're the one who brought up all these contradictions.\nPhoenix:\nAnd...?\nGodot:\nIf you're trying to tell us the old man just made a mistake... ...we can wrap up this case right now with a guilty verdict!\nJudge:\nHow about it, Mr. Wright? Should I just declare your client guilty?\nMaya:\nIs that the best you can come up with, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm sorry, Your Honor. I was the one who made a mistake.\nJudge:\nI'll give you one more chance, Mr. Wright. Think carefully before you answer this time!\nLeads back to:\n\"Yes, Your Honor.\"The ear doctor made a mistake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI believe we're looking at this the wrong way. It was actually the doctor's mistake.\nJudge:\nWhat?\nPhoenix:\nYes. The doctor got the wrong ear!\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nWell, I believe we saw an autopsy report yesterday. One that stated the victim's left eardrum was ruptured, and had medicine in it!\nJudge:\nI'm beginning to wonder if it's not your eardrum that's ruptured, Mr. Wright.\nMaya:\nThis is no time to be playing with people's perceptions, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm sorry, Your Honor. I was the one who made a mistake.\nJudge:\nI'll give you one more chance, Mr. Wright. Think carefully before you answer this time!\nLeads back to:\n\"Yes, Your Honor.\"The victim was a phony.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"This case is riddled with contradictions.\"Phoenix:\nThis case is riddled with contradictions. Yet, there is one very simple answer that clears them all up.Judge:\nA-And what is that?Phoenix:\nThe incident Mr. Kudo witnessed, and the incident the victim experienced... ...were two completely different events!Godot:\nWhat!?Phoenix:\nYes! The \"victim\" that Mr. Kudo saw wasn't Mr. Glen Elg at all! It was an imposter -- a phony pretending to be Mr. Elg! Obviously, unlike the victim, there was nothing wrong with the imposter's left eardrum. That's how he ended up wearing the earpiece in his left ear by mistake!Godot:\nPhwoooooooh!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Settle down, or I'll clear the courtroom!Godot:\nQuiet, gramps! Why don't you clear out of here, huh?Judge:\nWHAT DID YOU SAY!?Godot:\nTrite... Are you saying what Mr. Kudo saw was a set-up?Phoenix:\nYes. Someone pretended to be Glen Elg and acted out the whole coffee poisoning. All for the express purpose of creating a \"witness\" out of one Mr. Victor Kudo!Godot:Godot:\nGet real, Trite! Why would anyone want to do that?Phoenix:\nIsn't it obvious? The thing Mr. Kudo was most insistent about in his testimony was...Kudo:\nThe serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it! That's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well!Judge:\nI-It's so hard to believe, but...Phoenix:\nThere was one, and only one reason to show Mr. Kudo this fake poisoning! To show Maggey Byrde in the act of poisoning the coffee!Godot:Godot:\nAre you insinuating that the waitress in the old man's story was a fake as well? It's true that there were no customers in the restaurant at the time, but... ...it's also true that the chef was there! He would have noticed what was happening.Judge:\nTh-That's right! Well, witness? If your restaurant really was the scene of such theatrics... ...you would have known about it, correct!?Armstrong:\nOh l\u00e0 l\u00e0... Z'is is most difficult for me...Phoenix:Phoenix:\nNo, it's quite simple. All you have to do is testify. You are under oath, after all. Was there, in fact, a phony at Tr\u00e9s Bien that day!? The defense demands that Mr. Armstrong tell the whole truth about what happened.Judge:\nThe defense's request for additional testimony is accepted. You will accurately explain, in detail, the events in the restaurant that day!Armstrong:\nOu... Oui.Witness Testimony-- In the Restaurant --Armstrong:\nLa victim, Monsieur Elg, 'e came to my restaurant alone.\nI remember la old man arrived not long after 'im.\nZ'ere were no other customers.\nWhen 'e got word 'e won la lottery, Mon. Elg became very excited.\nIt was approximately 5 minutes later z'at la poisoning incident occurred.\nNon, z'ere was no time for a phony to do la acting.Judge:\n...Just so we're clear, there was no mirror in the restaurant, after all?Armstrong:\nJe vous demande pardon! Forgive me, Your Honor! I lied because I wanted z'is mess to be cleared up quickly.Judge:\nWhat you have just done is commit perjury, Mr. Armstrong! I will decide how to punish you later.Armstrong:\nO-Oui...Judge:\nFor now, we will hear your cross-examination. Mr. Wright, if you please. (Changed from [For now, we will hear your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.] in the original release)Phoenix:\n(Hmm.. He took that perjury charge a bit too well. But I'm guessing he'll be more serious trouble after this cross-examination!)Cross Examination-- In the Restaurant --Armstrong:\nLa victim, Monsieur Elg, 'e came to my restaurant alone.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWas he alone at his table as well?\nArmstrong:\nMais, oui. I saw 'im from la kitchen.\nPhoenix:\nYet the defendant, Ms. Byrde, remembers it differently. She swears there was another man at the victim's table.\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHa...! Unfortunately for you, Trite... ...yesterday's witness also testified that the victim was alone.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nYou know, seeing you squirm like that reminds me... ...of a certain coffee's bitter-sweet bite.\nPhoenix:\n(What kind of coffee has he been drinking!?)\nMaya:\nIt's not coffee, it's love! It's love that's bitter-sweet.\nPhoenix:\n(Hearing Maya say that makes her seem wise all of a sudden...)Armstrong:\nI remember la old man arrived not long after 'im.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBy old man, you mean Victor Kudo, correct?\nArmstrong:\nOui. 'E comes often for my special coffee.\nGodot:\nI drank your coffee once, Mr. Armstrong. It's special, I'll give you that. It's worth a sip just for the experience.\nArmstrong:\nOh, you make me so 'appy, monsieur! You are most welcome any time!\nGodot:\nI said it was worth one sip, and nothing more.\nPhoenix:\n(So old Mr. Kudo arrived at the restaurant around the same time as the victim. Maybe I should ask about his arrival in more detail.)\n\n\n\nDon't ask anything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(All I need to do is establish that this phony victim really existed. Asking more about the old man is only going to cloud the issue.) I think that's enough about coffee. Please continue with your testimony, Mr. Armstrong.\nArmstrong:\nYou are welcome any time too, Monsieur Wright. I'll brew something special for you!\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nHow many minutes after?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you're saying that not much time elapsed between when the victim and Mr. Kudo arrived?\nArmstrong:\nOui. Z'at is correct.\nPhoenix:\n(But that still leaves the possibility that something happened in that gap of time.) And by your recollection, how much time would you say elapsed?\nArmstrong:\nLet me see... Approximately 2 minutes, I would say.\nPhoenix:\nT-Two minutes!? That's all?\nJudge:\nHmm... It seems unlikely that anything untoward could have happened in such a short time.\nPhoenix:\n(Rats! I knew I shouldn't have pursued this line of questioning...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nWhat time is it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOut of curiosity, about what time was it when Mr. Kudo arrived?\nArmstrong:\nOh, no... I cannot remember, monsieur.\nJudge:\nHmm... I believe we were told by a witness yesterday...\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThe crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.\n\n\nJudge:\nDoes that perhaps jog your memory, witness?\nArmstrong:\nLa incident 'appened about 20 minutes after 'e arrived. So the victim must 'ave arrived between 2:00 PM and 2:10 PM, non?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Just after 2, huh...)\nArmstrong:\nThank you for your 'elp, in jogging my memory, monsieur. You are wonderful!\nJudge:\nHah hah hah! I can't sit here all the time and do nothing now, can I!? The time of day will be added to the witness's testimony.\nArmstrong:\nOui, Monsieur Judge. Everything I do, I do it for you!\nJudge:\nMerci bien. That's French, isn't it? Hah hah hah!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm glad at least one person is in a good mood...)\nMaya:\nH-He's even humming a song to himself...!\nChanges statement from \"I remember la old man arrived not long after 'im.\" to \"I remember la old man arrived not long after 'im, just after 2 PM.\"Armstrong:\nI remember la old man arrived not long after 'im, just after 2 PM.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely sure about the time?\nArmstrong:\nWhen I think really 'ard, 1 am sure it was just after 2. Oui. It is la time I stop serving la lunch menu.\nJudge:\nQuite right. I always break for lunch when the restaurants are serving their specials. I've been known to wind up a case early just to make it on time! Hah hah!\nPhoenix:\n(I guess you should never get between a hungry judge and his lunch...)\nJudge:\nOh, would you look at that! It's almost lunchtime already.\nPhoenix:\nWitness! Get on with your testimony, please!Present Millionaire Radio Flyer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I'm afraid I've finally got you, Mr. Armstrong.\"Armstrong:\nZ'ere were no other customers.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo your only customers were Mr. Kudo and the victim?\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHow many times do you need to ask the same thing, Trite? You'd never catch me drinking the same blend twice!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGodot:\nYou're trying to establish the presence of a \"phony victim\" in the restaurant. But you're wasting your time. You can't grind bird seed to make coffee, if you catch my drift...\nPhoenix:\n(But there's a hole in this testimony somewhere! I'm sure of it!)Armstrong:\nWhen 'e got word 'e won la lottery, Mon. Elg became very excited.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid you see him?\nArmstrong:\nNon, I was in ze kitchen. But I 'eard 'im. I remember 'im shouting, \"Yes! 'Alf a million bucks!\"\nGodot:\nPresumably the defendant heard that too, then, correct?\nArmstrong:\nMaggey...? She looked like a poor little frightened dove!\nPhoenix:\nAnd what about Mr. Kudo?\nArmstrong:\nLa old man chocked on some bird seed z'at got stuck in 'is throat.\nJudge:\nHmm... It seems we now have yet another incident on our hands.Armstrong:\nIt was approximately 5 minutes later z'at la poisoning incident occurred.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd what were you doing at that point? Without any customers, you must have had time to kill.\nArmstrong:\nI am multi-talented woman, monsieur!\nPhoenix:\nSorry? What do you mean?\nArmstrong:\nZ'ere is la renowned chef, Jean Armstrong, and la tragic poet, Claurice Armstrong.\nJudge:\nC-C-Claurice...?\nArmstrong:\nOui. I was writing a poem. An angry tale of a chef in 'alf a million dollars of debt... ...cooking for a man who won 'alf a million dollars on la lottery! It is called, \"Pourquoi\". It means, \"Why\". Per'aps I could recite it for la court?\nPhoenix:\nPlease don't...Present Millionaire Radio Flyer (after changing second statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I'm afraid I've finally got you, Mr. Armstrong.\"Armstrong:\nNon, z'ere was no time for a phony to do la acting.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou mean you contacted the police as soon as the incident occurred?\nArmstrong:\nI asked la old man to call from la pay phone.\nGodot:\nBy your own argument, Trite... ...the purpose of this \"phony victim's\" performance was so the old man would see it. In other words... ...once the incident occurred, this opportunity would completely disappear.\nJudge:\nIndeed.\nArmstrong:\nBien. It seems la shadow of doubt 'as been lifted, n'est-ce pas?\nPhoenix:\n...Present Millionaire Radio Flyer (after changing second statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I'm afraid I've finally got you, Mr. Armstrong.\"Maya:\nI guess Mr. Armstrong is connected to this case, huh?Phoenix:\nAbsolutely. Someone was impersonating Mr. Elg, and I refuse to believe he was oblivious. He was there the whole time, after all.Maya:\nBut if you're right, wouldn't Maggey have noticed, too?Phoenix:\nShe fell unconscious when the incident occurred, remember?Maya:\nAh! You mean that's when the phony staged his act?Phoenix:\nWe'll know for sure once I find a hole in this testimony.Phoenix:\nI'm afraid I've finally got you, Mr. Armstrong.Armstrong:\nQ-Quoi? What do you mean?Phoenix:\nAt the time in question, the victim was listening to the radio with his earpiece. The show he was listening to was \"Millionaire Radio\". Each week, they announce the winning number of a half million dollar lottery ticket.Armstrong:\nOui. Z'at must be la show Mon. Elg was listening to.Judge:\nI can't see any problem with this testimony, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nI wonder...Armstrong:\n...?Phoenix:\nYou say the victim arrived at your restaurant after 2 PM, correct?Armstrong:\nOui, oui. I am sure of it. I remember it perfectly now! I know it was z'at time, because I 'ad just finished serving la lunch menu.Godot:\nGet to the point, Trite. If you have one.Phoenix:\nThat show is broadcast live at 1:30 PM. And it claims to be \"the most thrilling 10 minutes of your life\"...Judge:\nI-It's on the air at 1:30!?Phoenix:\nNow, supposedly, the victim made some noise when it was announced that he had won. And yet... I don't believe his cry of joy could have occurred after 2 PM! Because the show had already finished more than 30 minutes earlier by that point in time!Armstrong:\nNooooooooon!Phoenix:\nThis \"victim\" we've been told about has done nothing but the impossible! Listening to the radio with a ruptured eardrum, catching a show that was already over... There is only one conclusion you can draw from these facts! This \"victim\" was an imposter, acting out the poisoning 30 minutes after the real murder! Yes, there were two Glen Elgs in Tr\u00e9s Bien that day. The real Glen Elg, now dead, having been poisoned by the real killer... ...and the phony Glen Elg, acting out the events for Mr. Kudo to witness!Judge:\nI-It certainly seems that way... I mean, if that wasn't the case, how could you explain the time discrepancy?Godot:Godot:\nQuite a performance, Trite. You were almost on a roll.Phoenix:\n...!Godot:\nBut sadly, you lack the rock hard foundation of rhythm to build your song!Phoenix:\n(...What is this? Music Theory 101?)Godot:\nLet's recap. According to your \"imaginative\" theory, it's now just after 2 PM... The phony Elg is performing a play for the benefit of Mr. Kudo. How do you explain then, where the real Glen Elg is!?Phoenix:\nI don't believe I have to spell this out for court! However! At that time, the real Glen Elg was already dead!Judge:\nThat's certainly the obvious conclusion.Godot:Godot:\nThank you, Trite. That's exactly what I was hoping you would say.Phoenix:\nWh-What!?Godot:\nNow, I presume you can prove this theory of yours...? Can you explain where the missing corpse went to!?Phoenix:\nTh-The missing corpse...?Godot:\nAccording to the old man's testimony, there was only one other customer there. If that \"customer\" was the phony Glen Elg... ...then where did the killer hide the body of the real victim!?Phoenix:\nNaaaaaargh!Judge:\nThe prosecution has a valid point, Mr. Wright. If your theory is to stand up to examination by the court... ...you must provide us with proof by answering the prosecution's question. Where did the killer hide the body?Phoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor...Godot:\nNo conjecture, Trite. Let's hear some facts for once. Show the court a piece of evidence that proves where the body was hidden!Phoenix:\nE-Evidence!?Maya:\nWh-What's with the intense pressure in here all of a sudden!?Phoenix:\n(I thought I had him with that contradiction. But he's turned it all around and backed me into a corner instead!)Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? The court will now hear the defense's theory and evidence. First, where was the body of the real Mr. Elg concealed?Outside Tr\u00e9s Bien\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nClearly, there's no place to hide a body inside Tr\u00e9s Bien. Therefore, the killer must have hauled the body outside!\nJudge:\nHmm... I see.\nGodot:\nNice supposition. But the real question is, \"Can you back it up?\" Where's the evidence that proves the body was hidden in that location!?\n\n\n\nPresent anything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nGodot:\nToo bad... I don't think you'll ever grasp the real heart of Rock'n'Roll.\nPhoenix:\nWhat are you talking about?\nJudge:\nHe means that your evidence is irrelevant, Mr. Wright!\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! You've got to think it through! Feel the beat! And then hit him with some heavy metal!\nPhoenix:\n(OK, I need to calm down and get my facts straight. What should I do now?)\n\n\n\nStart over\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI-I think I need to clear my head...\nGodot:\nHa...! I'd say it's already empty, Trite!\nJudge:\nI'm inclined to agree.\nArmstrong:\nYo tambi\u00e9n.\nPhoenix:\n(What's with the Spanish all of a sudden!?)\nLeads back to:\n\"Well, Mr. Wright? The court will now hear the defense's theory and evidence.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent more evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(There's nothing wrong with my logic so far, I'm sure of it! I'll hit them with another piece of evidence and see if that helps...)\nLeads back to:\n\"Clearly, there's no place to hide a body inside Tr\u00e9s Bien.\"Inside Tr\u00e9s Bien\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt'd would [sic] have been too dangerous to take the body outside. Obviously, the body must have been hidden somewhere inside Tr\u00e9s Bien.\nJudge:\nHmm... Interesting... But where could a body have been hidden inside a restaurant? Perhaps you would care to show the court on these plans, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. The exact location where the body was concealed inside Tr\u00e9s Bien is...\n\n\n\nPresent anywhere\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe body was hidden here!\nJudge:\nHmm... I see.\nGodot:\nNice supposition. But the real question is, \"Can you back it up?\" Where's the evidence that proves the body was hidden in that location!?\n\n\n\nPresent Small Bottle (after presenting Kitchen)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Armstrong! Do you recognize this bottle?\"\n\n\n\n\nOtherwise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nGodot:\nToo bad... I don't think you'll ever grasp the real heart of Rock'n'Roll.\nPhoenix:\nWhat are you talking about?\nJudge:\nHe means that your evidence is irrelevant, Mr. Wright!\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! You've got to think it through! Feel the beat! And then hit him with some heavy metal!\nPhoenix:\n(OK, I need to calm down and get my facts straight.

The court will now hear the defense's theory and evidence.\"\n\n\n\n\nPick another location\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(There's nothing wrong with my logic so far, I'm sure of it! I'll have another go at proving where the body was hidden.)\nLeads back to:\n\"It'd would have been too dangerous to take the body outside.\"Phoenix:\nMr. Armstrong! Do you recognize this bottle?Armstrong:\nNon! Non, non, non! I 'ave never seen z'at ugly bottle before in my life! I only use la very best bottles, monsieur! Z'e 'ighest quality only for me!Judge:\nWhere was that bottle found, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nInterestingly enough, Your Honor. it was found in the kitchen of Tr\u00e9s Bien.Armstrong:\nEh? Quoi!? But I only ever use z'ese bottles for my aromatherapy oils.Phoenix:\nBut this bottle doesn't contain aromatherapy oil, Mr. Armstrong. No, it contains a medication.Judge:\nWhat kind of medication?Phoenix:\nI'm sure everyone remembers, don't they? That Mr. Elg visited an otolaryngological clinic, and was given medication that day!Godot:\nY-You can't be serious...Phoenix:\nThe defense had the contents of the bottle analyzed, and I have the lab results here! The contents of the bottle match the prescription that was given to Mr. Elg!Godot:\nBwooooar!Phoenix:\nGlen Elg's murderer hid the body in the restaurant kitchen. At which time, this bottle fell out of the victim's pocket. Mr. Armstrong! When the incident occurred, didn't you say you were in the kitchen?Armstrong:\nM-M-Mon dieu!Phoenix:\nYes, you know about what I'm about to say, It was YOU who hid the victim's body! You did a fine job pretending to defend my client, Maggey Byrde. However! You were setting her up to take the fall behind the poor girl's back!Armstrong:\nNooooooooon!Judge:\nO-Order! Order! This is an extraordinary development. Witness! Did you... Did you murder Mr. Glen Elg?Armstrong:\nNever! I could not do such an 'orrible thing!Godot:\nNoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!Judge:\nM-Mr. Godot!?Godot:\n...The bitterness... Every time I get lied to, I always down a mug of coffee. ...That's one of my rules.Phoenix:\n(Do you have the slightest idea how many cups you've had by now...?)Godot:\nThen I like to do the same to the person who lied to me. I like to take them down with my empty cup! Listen up, chef! How about a brand new flavor in your ear, my \"h\" deficient friend?Armstrong:\nJe vous demande pardon! Please, you must 'ear me out! It is a trap! Listen to me! Por favor!Judge:\nYo hablo Espa\u00f1ol, Mr. Armstrong, and \"Por favor\" is Spanish.Godot:\nI'm only going to ask you once. Did you do it?Armstrong:\nNon! Non, non! Absolutely non! I simply... I...Godot:\nLet's hear it. You've got one shot. Right, gramps?Judge:\nWitness! The court will permit you the chance to make one final statement. If you lie under oath again, Mr. Godot's coffee mug awaits you... As does my gavel!Armstrong:\nO-Oui... It is clear.Phoenix:\n(What do they always say in the movies...? \"I've got a bad feeling about this...\"?)Judge:\nVery well! Begin your final testimony, Mr. Armstrong!Witness Testimony-- The Confession --Armstrong:\nIt is true, I 'id la body in la kitchen.\nA man forced me to do it.

By who!?Armstrong:\nI-I cannot say! Or I will be... erased!Phoenix:\nLet's try a different question then. When Mr. Elg died, was he really the only person at his table?Armstrong:\n... Z'ere was... Z'ere was another man.Phoenix:\n(I knew it!)Maya:\nMaggey was telling the truth!Judge:\nYou may cross-examine the witness now, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\n(There's just one more thing I need to do.

That's that small bottle I gave back to you this morning, right?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. I think it's time we solved the last mystery of who the prints on it belongs to.\nGumshoe:\nSure thing, pal! Actually, that's been gnawing at me, too!\nLeads to:\n\"Small Bottle given to Detective Gumshoe.\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nMaya:\nWhat are you doing, Nick!? If Detective Gumshoe's going to check some prints for us, shouldn't he be checking this?\nGumshoe:\nThat's that small bottle I gave back to you this morning, right?\nPhoenix:\nThe victim's ear medication that we found in the kitchen?\nMaya:\nLook, it even says, \"covered in unidentified fingerprints\" right in the Court Record!\nGumshoe:\nYou're right!

Yesterday's session didn't go so well, and then ended on a giant mystery.Phoenix:\n(That's true... And we still haven't solved a single part of it yet...)Maya:\nAre you OK, Nick?Phoenix:\nHuh? Oh, uh... Yeah. Of course.Byrde:\nI saw that! That little flash of doubt in your eyes!Phoenix:\nN-No! That wasn't doubt. That was, umm... determination!Byrde:\nWhy don't I believe you...?Maya:\nIt's nearly time, Maggey. You'd better get going to the defendant's seat.Byrde:\nRoger. Don't let me down, Mr. Wright. I'm counting on you!Hey, pal!Phoenix:\nHey, Detective Gumshoe...Gumshoe:\nQuit stressing Maggey out! She doesn't need that!Phoenix:\nH-How did you know she was stressed...?Gumshoe:\nI was watching through the doorway.Phoenix:\nOh...Gumshoe:\nYou look like you lost the case already. Show a bit of confidence, will you, pal!? Here, maybe this'll help.Maya:\nHuh!? Have you taken up aromatherapy, too?Gumshoe:\nNot in a million years, pal! Don't tell me that you don't remember this thing?Phoenix:\n(Hmm... Come to think of it, that doesn't look like one of those aromatherapy bottles...)Gumshoe:\nThis is the small bottle that turned up in Tr\u00e9s Bien's kitchen a couple of days ago.Maya:\nWow! Look at all these little bottles!Phoenix:\nOh! They're aromatherapy oils! He's got so many, they're overflowing onto the floor...Maya:\nHey, wait a minute... There's one bottle that's different from all the others.Phoenix:\nWell what do you know. And it doesn't have a label either.Maya:\nAnd... *sniff* It doesn't smell.Gumshoe:\nWe finally got the analysis results back from the lab.Maya:\nSo!? What is it? Is it the poison?Gumshoe:\nI'm afraid not, pal. It's... medication.Maya:\nMedication?Gumshoe:\nYeah. For ears. Topical use only, apparently.Phoenix:\nFor ears? You mean...?Gumshoe:\nYeah. It's the medication Glen Elg was using for his ruptured eardrum!Phoenix:\n(What was Glen Elg's ear medicine doing in the kitchen...?)Small Bottle refiled into the Court Record.Phoenix:\nUm, what about the unidentified fingerprints? Anything on that?Gumshoe:\nSomeone screwed up, so they only had time to analyze the contents of the bottle. Another hour and they might have gotten something on the prints, but...Phoenix:\n(Hmm... That's going to weaken its impact as a piece of evidence...)Gumshoe:\nOK, pal! This is it! Make sure your defense is impregnable today, got it!?Phoenix:\n(Today's trial... I'm gonna expose that guy for what he's done, or my name isn't Phoenix Wright!)January 8, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Maggey Byrde.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Godot:\nReady and waiting as always, Your Honor.Judge:\nVery good. Then we'll get underway at once. Yesterday we heard the testimony of Mr. Victor Kudo. He claims to have witnessed the defendant putting a powder into the victim's coffee. However, the witness's testimony was plagued with a number of problems.Godot:\nThe mark on the rim of the cup shows that the victim drank from it with his right hand. But according to the old man's testimony, he picked it up with his left hand.Judge:\nThank you, Mr. Godot. Furthermore, according to the witness's account... ...the victim was listening to the radio with an earpiece in his left ear. Yet, the victim's left eardrum was ruptured, which made him effectively deaf in that ear.Maya:\nIt's amazing how many contradictions a single case can have, huh Nick?Godot:\nHa...! Allow me to enlighten you, Your Honor. The world, you see, keeps turning, and we must turn with it.Judge:\n... You've lost me already, Mr. Godot.Godot:\nDon't let the mysteries of yesterday mystify you today. Only losers think like that. You've got to change with the times! That's one of my rules!Judge:\nAre you implying that you've resolved these contradictions? You know the answers to these riddles!?Godot:\nThe old guy wasn't just throwing seed in here. He was throwing us off the scent. And today I'll prove it.Judge:\nVery well. Let the first witness take the stand!Godot:\nAnd you are?Armstrong:\nOh bonjour, everyone! I am Jean Armstrong. z'e owner and 'ead chef of la Tr\u00e9s Bien restaurant. Enchant\u00e9!.........Judge:\nForgive me for asking, witness, but... are you a woman?Armstrong:\nOh l\u00e0 l\u00e0, monsieur! As you can see, I am la pert and perky gentleman, non?Judge:\nEr... Umm...Godot:\nOn the day of the incident, you were in Tr\u00e9s Bien's kitchen. Isn't that right?Armstrong:\nW'iz you monsieur...Godot:\n...?Armstrong:\n...everything feels right!Godot:\nHa...!Phoenix:\n(Wow, he's totally unfazed! Doesn't anything intimidate this guy...?)Judge:\nVery well. Your testimony please, witness. Please tell the court what happened that day at Tr\u00e9s Bien.Armstrong:\nOui! Volontiers!Witness Testimony-- At Tr\u00e9s Bien --Armstrong:\nWhen it all 'appened, z'ere were just two customers in my restaurant.\nI remember I was experimenting w'iz some new art deco z'at day.\nLike 'aving a large mirror between la tables, for example.\nOui! Per'aps z'at is what la old man was looking at.\nLa cup, la earpiece, and la glasses... 'E would 'ave seen everyz'ing in reverse, non?Phoenix:\nA m...m...m... MIRROR!?Armstrong:\nOui! Un grand mirror! La most enormous mirror!Godot:\nAnd suddenly, the mystery disappears! Like I said, the world keeps turning, so roll with it!Judge:\nHmm... That would explain the coffee cup and the earpiece conundrum... The mirror would have made everything appear back to front.Phoenix:\n(What the heck!? It's way too early in the morning for this to be happening to me!)Judge:\nNow then, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- At Tr\u00e9s Bien --Armstrong:\nWhen it all 'appened, z'ere were just two customers in my restaurant.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd who were the two customers, exactly?\nArmstrong:\nMais, of course. La young man who died... ...and la other, not-so-young, man.\nJudge:\nHmm... You are referring to yesterday's witness, I presume?\nPhoenix:\n(What about the other man Maggey says she saw at the table? Something tells me Mr. Armstrong isn't planning to disclose his existence...)\nMaya:\nWe need some hard evidence first before we can bring him up, don't we...?\nPhoenix:\nI guess I'll just have to try a different approach for the time being.Armstrong:\nI remember I was experimenting w'iz some new art deco z'at day.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou were experimenting with art deco? How come I never heard about that before today?\nArmstrong:\nYou are not familiar w'iz z'e language of interior design, monsieur?\nPhoenix:\nPlease stay on topic! Now, why didn't you tell the court about this before!?\nArmstrong:\nBut I did. Just a few moments ago!\nJudge:\nAhem! Excuse me, Mr. Armstrong. This \"deco\" you mentioned... Are you referring to some sort of \"decocture\"?\nPhoenix:\nNo, no! Art deco, it is a style of design! ...Your Honor. He's talking about interior design. Walls, ceilings, carpets, that kind of thing.\nJudge:\nAh, yes. Of course. That \"deco\".\nArmstrong:\nI was trying to achieve a more \"la effeminate\" look for my restaurant. I was planning z'e most bold remodeling of la decor.Armstrong:\nLike 'aving a large mirror between la tables, for example.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow big of a mirror are we talking about here?\nArmstrong:\nBof! Something about 4 meters wide and, err... Oui. About 2 meters 'igh.\nPhoenix:\n(Let's see... If 1 meter is about 1 yard... Holy glass in a frame, that's huge!)\nArmstrong:\nI was intending to install it on la ceiling eventually.\nPhoenix:\nThe ceiling!? (Was there a mirror on the ceiling!? I don't remember...)\nArmstrong:\nMais, non. But I decided not to go through w'iz it in z'e end.\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I ask him more about the mirror or not?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(He couldn't lie about such a huge object like that. It must've been there in the restaurant somewhere.)\nGodot:\n...\nLeads to:\n\"Hmm... So the witness yesterday had seen the victim reflected in a mirror...\"\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIf you really had such a large mirror in the restaurant, someone would have noticed it! But there's nothing about a mirror in Mr. Kudo or Maggey Byrde's testimonies!\nArmstrong:\nB-But...\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nYou didn't ask, Trite. You have only yourself to blame for such sloppy work.\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nGodot:\nA mirror was delivered to Tr\u00e9s Bien the day before the incident.\nPhoenix:\nR-Really?\nGodot:\nAs Mr. Armstrong testified, he was carrying out some design changes. And as it turned out, he didn't actually use the mirror in the end.\nPhoenix:\n(This just doesn't add up. Even if a mirror was delivered to Tr\u00e9s Bien... ...it doesn't prove that it was in the restaurant on the day of the crime.)\nGodot:\nHa...! If you want to doubt someone, Trite, look in the mirror. I'm sure the person looking back at you will be dubious enough!\nLeads to:\n\"Hmm... So the witness yesterday had seen the victim reflected in a mirror...\"\n\n\nJudge:\nHmm... So the witness yesterday had seen the victim reflected in a mirror...Armstrong:\nOui! Per'aps z'at is what la old man was looking at.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nNormally, I'd expect people to know the difference between a reflection and a real object.\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\n\"Normally\"? How does normality come into this? That's lame, Trite. Even for you.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGodot:\nAre you trying to say that if something isn't normal, it isn't possible? Is that it? Where does that leave the porcu-headed lawyer and the topknot chick over there... and the ungodly cool guy with the mask over here? Well, Trite!?\nPhoenix:\nAaack! Not the hair!\nMaya:\nI do not have a topknot!\nJudge:\nMr. Godot is correct. A lack of normality is no basis for discounting an argument.\nArmstrong:\nBien! Logic 'as won la day!Armstrong:\nLa cup, la earpiece, and la glasses... 'E would 'ave seen everyz'ing in reverse, non?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nEverything? He would have seen everything in reverse?\nArmstrong:\nOui.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick... We should take a sec and think about what Old Seedy said in his testimony...\nPhoenix:\n(How did he phrase it again...?)\n\n\nKudo:\nThe boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs.\n\n\nKudo:\nNo question! You can lock me up if I'm wrong! It was his left ear, without a doubt!\n\n\nKudo:\nAnd then he used the same hand to pick up the cup. His left hand!\n\n\nMaya:\nIf he saw everything he described reflected in a mirror... ...then everything he said he saw on the \"left\" was actually on the \"right\", huh.\nPhoenix:\n(And that clears up all the problems with his testimony, I guess... Or does it...?)\nGodot:\nHa...!Present Glen Elg profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The coffee cup, the earpiece, and the HMD...\"Phoenix:\n(It's kinda hard to believe everything's the fault of a mirror, but...)Maya:\nDo you think Old Seedy saw everything through a reflection...?Phoenix:\nIf he did, it would explain all the contradictions in his testimony.Maya:\nBut that just makes the situation worse for Maggey! There's gotta be something in that old man's testimony! We've just gotta dig deeper!Phoenix:\nThe coffee cup, the earpiece, and the HMD... Let's think back over Mr. Kudo's testimony for a second, shall we?Kudo:\nThe boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs.Kudo:\nNo question! You can lock me up if I'm wrong! It was his left ear, without a doubt!Phoenix:\nSo, to summarize... ...we were told both the HMD and the earpiece were on the victim's left side. Now, if Mr. Kudo saw all that as a reflection in a mirror... ...it means both the HMD and the earpiece were actually on the victim's right side.Armstrong:\nExactement! You see, monsieur. Now z'at you think about it, it is not so 'ard, non?Phoenix:\nUnfortunately, that's where we run into a monumental contradiction with the facts! If Mr. Kudo really did see everything in a mirror... ...why is it that the HMD is now on the wrong side of his head!?Judge:\nOrder! Order! ...Mr. Wright is correct! If the witness genuinely observed the victim reflected in a mirror... ...then we would expect the victim's eyepiece to have been over his right eye.Godot:Godot:\n...How bitter. Trite, you should have a taste of this bitterness. It'll calm you down in no time.Phoenix:\nA-Are we talking about your coffee... or something completely different...?Godot:\nYou don't understand the way the witness thinks.Judge:\nHow he thinks?Godot:\nYou remember this, I presume?Phoenix:\nThe \"I broke the vase... sorry\" apology lett-- I mean Mr. Kudo's sworn testimony?Godot:\nExactly. The old man has one very grievous habit... other than throwing seeds. The more of an impression something makes, the more muddled his mind makes it. And what's the most striking thing about Mr. Elg?Judge:\nClearly, it's the victim's eyepiece.Godot:\nAnd that's my point. The old man strikes again! Mr. Elg's HMD made a big impression on the old man. \"I saw the earpiece and those new-fangled spectacles he was wearing! Oh, yes! They were both on his left ear! Do you hear? His left ear!\" Ha...! Well, Trite?Phoenix:\nUrk... (That's the worst, but best impression of Kudo ever...)Maya:\nWow! I really thought he was Old Seedy for a minute there! Godot's good!Judge:\nEnough! I must agree that yesterday's witness was irresponsibly rash in much of his testimony.Maya:\nBad luck, Nick. Looks like the \"boil\" of a contradiction you found is just a \"rash\".Godot:\nA mirror can't be beaten by a handful of seeds, nor can it lie. So... What exactly was the old man looking at? Fill us in, Mr. Armstrong. Go on, tell the court. We're all ears.Armstrong:\nOui. I can explain. Please, if you will look at la plans of la restaurant.Witness Testimony-- The Mirror --Armstrong:\nAlors. Is everyone sitting comfortably?\nLa mirror, it was in z'e middle of la restaurant, dividing z'e two 'alves.\nZ'ere is only one seat from which you could 'ave seen an image of la victim.\nZ'at was la seat at z'e table next to la victim's. Z'at was where la old man was sitting.\nAfter la terrible incident occurred, I move la mirror so it was not in z'e way.\nBut naturally, I did not touch anything else!Judge:\nHmm... I see no problems with the explanation we have just heard. From the table next to the victim's, Mr. Kudo could have seen the victim in the mirror.Armstrong:\nWhat a naughty little coquette I am, confusing all z'e men like z'is!Godot:\nDon't worry about it. We can keep up, except for the guy breaking out in a cold sweat over there again.Phoenix:\n(Argh! I hate that guy!)Judge:\nYou said you didn't touch anything else apart from the mirror. Are you quite sure about that?Armstrong:\nVolontiers! Of course!Judge:\nVery well. Mr. Wright. Your cross-examination, if you please.Cross Examination-- The Mirror --Armstrong:\nLa mirror, it was in z'e middle of la restaurant, dividing z'e two 'alves.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, run this by me again. The mirror was here, correct?\nArmstrong:\nOui.\nPhoenix:\nOui? Really!? Because I know if I were you, I wouldn't have put a mirror there! It would be in the way!\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nLook who's talking, Trite.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGodot:\nYou're obstructing my view, among other things.\nPhoenix:\nBut, but, but! This is my seat in the courtroom...!\nGodot:\nTr\u00e9s Bien's \"charm\" is that it gives you the impression that you're the only customer. Temporarily placing a mirror in that spot would hardly be \"in the way\". Unlike you... Trite.\nArmstrong:\nI tell you, monsieur. la mirror was z'ere, in z'e middle of la restaurant.Armstrong:\nZ'ere is only one seat from which you could 'ave seen an image of la victim.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd where would that be!?\nArmstrong:\nOh l\u00e1 l\u00e1! Look 'ow you lean towards me! I always attract z'e younger boys! Maybe I should keep you in suspense a little longer!\nJudge:\nMr. Armstrong! Tell the court what you know at once!\nArmstrong:\nI attract z'e older ones, too, you know, 'andsome! Shall I tease you, too!?\nJudge:\nNnngh...\nGodot:\nI'm already seeing a very hot someone, so I'm afraid you'll be waiting for a long time.\nMaya:\nI bet she has mocha-cream skin and cappuccino perfume.\nArmstrong:\nBien. I will tell you... Z'ere was only one seat from which you could 'ave seen...Armstrong:\nZ'at was la seat at z'e table next to la victim's. Z'at was where la old man was sitting.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo why can you only see the victim from that particular seat?\nArmstrong:\nMais, monsieur. It is obvious, non? If you look at la plans you will understand. La victim would 'ave been reflected in la mirror like so. If you were sitting at la table next to 'im, you would see everything, non?\nMaya:\nSo that's the seat Old Seedy was sitting in on that day... ...when the poisoning happened.\nPhoenix:\n(The old man was sitting at the table next to the victim? Why does that seem kinda odd...?)Present Victor's Testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! Mr. Kudo's words yesterday strongly contradict Mr. Armstrong's testimony!\nJudge:\nThis is... the letter of apology that was written by Mr. Kudo, is it not?\nPhoenix:\nI realize it looks useless, Your Honor, but this is still testimony.\nGodot:\nHa...! I guess useless people are only really good at identifying useless things.\nJudge:\nWhat relevance does this scrap of paper have to the trial, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nMr. Kudo's testimony is actually very relevant to the question at hand, Your Honor! Because it very clearly contradicts with this piece of evidence!\n\n\n\nPresent Crime Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThis piece of evidence contradicts with testimony we have heard, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nThe crime photo...?\nPhoenix:\nYes.

What is the something that \"should not exist\" in this photo?\n\n\n\nPresent vase on left table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"There is one thing that was clearly demonstrated by yesterday's testimony.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThis is what should not be in the picture!\nJudge:\nI'm sorry?

Exactement. I carried it out of la restaurant z'en.\nPhoenix:\nYou moved a huge mirror like that all by yourself?\nArmstrong:\nWhat can I say? I know 'ow to pick things up, 'andsome!\nPhoenix:\n...\nGodot:\nHeh heh...\nMaya:\nG-Godot actually laughed at something!\nJudge:\nWell, given the witness's physique, I suppose it is possible.

In the meantime, the witness will repeat his testimony for the court.\nArmstrong:\nOui. I would be delighted!\nLeads back to cross-examinationMaya:\nIt is pretty strange, though, isn't it? I mean, nobody mentioned anything about a really large mirror. You'd think someone would've, but Maggey didn't, and neither did Old Seedy.Phoenix:\nThen the only logical explanation is... ...that there was no mirror inside Tr\u00e9s Bien that day. (Now I've just got to prove it... Somehow...)Phoenix:\nThere is one thing that was clearly demonstrated by yesterday's testimony. Mr. Kudo broke the vase that was on the table where he was sitting. And yet! As the court can see, there is an unbroken vase on the table next to the victim! Why? Because Mr. Kudo was not, in fact, sitting at the table next to the victim at all!Godot:Godot:\nDon't be an idiot, Trite! That's impossible! That seat's the only one Kudo could've seen the victim's reflection from!Phoenix:\nExactly!Godot:\n...!Phoenix:\nThere is only one conclusion we can draw from this contradiction. There was no mirror in Tr\u00e9s Bien that day! Your testimony, Mr. Armstrong, is an elaborate lie!Armstrong:\nMon dieeeeeeeu!Godot:Godot:\nDon't try to confuse the court, Trite! Obviously, the witness cleaned up the vase... ...while the police were taking their time getting to the crime scene!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nUnfortunately, Mr. Godot, that doesn't quite work for me. Mr. Armstrong already testified to the contrary. In his own words... \"I did not touch anything else\" except the mirror!Godot:\nUr... urgh! ... Gaaaaaaaaargh!Judge:\nWell, witness? What do you have to say for yourself?Armstrong:\n*sniffle*Phoenix:\n(I was right! There was no mirror in the restaurant that day!)Judge:\nIn light of this revelation, we return back to the original problem. Why did the victim have an earpiece in an ear in which he couldn't hear?Godot:\nHa...! You only get one shot in life. There's no turning back. If you want to claim that the mirror wasn't there, Trite... ...then this problem is all yours. How do you explain what the old man saw?Phoenix:\n(If I can answer this, then I'll be that much closer to the truth! I can feel it!)Maya:\n...Are you going to be OK? Can you really solve this contradiction, Nick?Phoenix:\nThere's more than just this one contradiction, Maya.Maya:\nWhat do you mean?Phoenix:\nRemember what Maggey told us? \"There was another man at the victim's table.\" And, \"there was a sample CD on the victim's table.\" It all flies in the face of Mr. Kudo's testimony. (And I think I know the reason why nothing in this case is adding up.)Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Let's hear your answer.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. The reason behind all the contradictions in Mr. Kudo's testimony is simple.Mr. Kudo made a mistake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nClearly, Mr. Kudo made a mistake!\nGodot:\nMr. Trite... You're the one who brought up all these contradictions.\nPhoenix:\nAnd...?\nGodot:\nIf you're trying to tell us the old man just made a mistake... ...we can wrap up this case right now with a guilty verdict!\nJudge:\nHow about it, Mr. Wright? Should I just declare your client guilty?\nMaya:\nIs that the best you can come up with, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm sorry, Your Honor. I was the one who made a mistake.\nJudge:\nI'll give you one more chance, Mr. Wright. Think carefully before you answer this time!\nLeads back to:\n\"Yes, Your Honor.\"The ear doctor made a mistake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI believe we're looking at this the wrong way. It was actually the doctor's mistake.\nJudge:\nWhat?\nPhoenix:\nYes. The doctor got the wrong ear!\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nWell, I believe we saw an autopsy report yesterday. One that stated the victim's left eardrum was ruptured, and had medicine in it!\nJudge:\nI'm beginning to wonder if it's not your eardrum that's ruptured, Mr. Wright.\nMaya:\nThis is no time to be playing with people's perceptions, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm sorry, Your Honor. I was the one who made a mistake.\nJudge:\nI'll give you one more chance, Mr. Wright. Think carefully before you answer this time!\nLeads back to:\n\"Yes, Your Honor.\"The victim was a phony.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"This case is riddled with contradictions.\"Phoenix:\nThis case is riddled with contradictions. Yet, there is one very simple answer that clears them all up.Judge:\nA-And what is that?Phoenix:\nThe incident Mr. Kudo witnessed, and the incident the victim experienced... ...were two completely different events!Godot:\nWhat!?Phoenix:\nYes! The \"victim\" that Mr. Kudo saw wasn't Mr. Glen Elg at all! It was an imposter -- a phony pretending to be Mr. Elg! Obviously, unlike the victim, there was nothing wrong with the imposter's left eardrum. That's how he ended up wearing the earpiece in his left ear by mistake!Godot:\nPhwoooooooh!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Settle down, or I'll clear the courtroom!Godot:\nQuiet, gramps! Why don't you clear out of here, huh?Judge:\nWHAT DID YOU SAY!?Godot:\nTrite... Are you saying what Mr. Kudo saw was a set-up?Phoenix:\nYes. Someone pretended to be Glen Elg and acted out the whole coffee poisoning. All for the express purpose of creating a \"witness\" out of one Mr. Victor Kudo!Godot:Godot:\nGet real, Trite! Why would anyone want to do that?Phoenix:\nIsn't it obvious? The thing Mr. Kudo was most insistent about in his testimony was...Kudo:\nThe serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it! That's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well!Judge:\nI-It's so hard to believe, but...Phoenix:\nThere was one, and only one reason to show Mr. Kudo this fake poisoning! To show Maggey Byrde in the act of poisoning the coffee!Godot:Godot:\nAre you insinuating that the waitress in the old man's story was a fake as well? It's true that there were no customers in the restaurant at the time, but... ...it's also true that the chef was there! He would have noticed what was happening.Judge:\nTh-That's right! Well, witness? If your restaurant really was the scene of such theatrics... ...you would have known about it, correct!?Armstrong:\nOh l\u00e0 l\u00e0... Z'is is most difficult for me...Phoenix:Phoenix:\nNo, it's quite simple. All you have to do is testify. You are under oath, after all. Was there, in fact, a phony at Tr\u00e9s Bien that day!? The defense demands that Mr. Armstrong tell the whole truth about what happened.Judge:\nThe defense's request for additional testimony is accepted. You will accurately explain, in detail, the events in the restaurant that day!Armstrong:\nOu... Oui.Witness Testimony-- In the Restaurant --Armstrong:\nLa victim, Monsieur Elg, 'e came to my restaurant alone.\nI remember la old man arrived not long after 'im.\nZ'ere were no other customers.\nWhen 'e got word 'e won la lottery, Mon. Elg became very excited.\nIt was approximately 5 minutes later z'at la poisoning incident occurred.\nNon, z'ere was no time for a phony to do la acting.Judge:\n...Just so we're clear, there was no mirror in the restaurant, after all?Armstrong:\nJe vous demande pardon! Forgive me, Your Honor! I lied because I wanted z'is mess to be cleared up quickly.Judge:\nWhat you have just done is commit perjury, Mr. Armstrong! I will decide how to punish you later.Armstrong:\nO-Oui...Judge:\nFor now, we will hear your cross-examination. Mr. Wright, if you please. (Changed from [For now, we will hear your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.] in the original release)Phoenix:\n(Hmm.. He took that perjury charge a bit too well. But I'm guessing he'll be more serious trouble after this cross-examination!)Cross Examination-- In the Restaurant --Armstrong:\nLa victim, Monsieur Elg, 'e came to my restaurant alone.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWas he alone at his table as well?\nArmstrong:\nMais, oui. I saw 'im from la kitchen.\nPhoenix:\nYet the defendant, Ms. Byrde, remembers it differently. She swears there was another man at the victim's table.\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHa...! Unfortunately for you, Trite... ...yesterday's witness also testified that the victim was alone.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nYou know, seeing you squirm like that reminds me... ...of a certain coffee's bitter-sweet bite.\nPhoenix:\n(What kind of coffee has he been drinking!?)\nMaya:\nIt's not coffee, it's love! It's love that's bitter-sweet.\nPhoenix:\n(Hearing Maya say that makes her seem wise all of a sudden...)Armstrong:\nI remember la old man arrived not long after 'im.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBy old man, you mean Victor Kudo, correct?\nArmstrong:\nOui. 'E comes often for my special coffee.\nGodot:\nI drank your coffee once, Mr. Armstrong. It's special, I'll give you that. It's worth a sip just for the experience.\nArmstrong:\nOh, you make me so 'appy, monsieur! You are most welcome any time!\nGodot:\nI said it was worth one sip, and nothing more.\nPhoenix:\n(So old Mr. Kudo arrived at the restaurant around the same time as the victim. Maybe I should ask about his arrival in more detail.)\n\n\n\nDon't ask anything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(All I need to do is establish that this phony victim really existed. Asking more about the old man is only going to cloud the issue.) I think that's enough about coffee. Please continue with your testimony, Mr. Armstrong.\nArmstrong:\nYou are welcome any time too, Monsieur Wright. I'll brew something special for you!\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nHow many minutes after?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you're saying that not much time elapsed between when the victim and Mr. Kudo arrived?\nArmstrong:\nOui. Z'at is correct.\nPhoenix:\n(But that still leaves the possibility that something happened in that gap of time.) And by your recollection, how much time would you say elapsed?\nArmstrong:\nLet me see... Approximately 2 minutes, I would say.\nPhoenix:\nT-Two minutes!? That's all?\nJudge:\nHmm... It seems unlikely that anything untoward could have happened in such a short time.\nPhoenix:\n(Rats! I knew I shouldn't have pursued this line of questioning...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nWhat time is it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOut of curiosity, about what time was it when Mr. Kudo arrived?\nArmstrong:\nOh, no... I cannot remember, monsieur.\nJudge:\nHmm... I believe we were told by a witness yesterday...\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThe crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.\n\n\nJudge:\nDoes that perhaps jog your memory, witness?\nArmstrong:\nLa incident 'appened about 20 minutes after 'e arrived. So the victim must 'ave arrived between 2:00 PM and 2:10 PM, non?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Just after 2, huh...)\nArmstrong:\nThank you for your 'elp, in jogging my memory, monsieur. You are wonderful!\nJudge:\nHah hah hah! I can't sit here all the time and do nothing now, can I!? The time of day will be added to the witness's testimony.\nArmstrong:\nOui, Monsieur Judge. Everything I do, I do it for you!\nJudge:\nMerci bien. That's French, isn't it? Hah hah hah!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm glad at least one person is in a good mood...)\nMaya:\nH-He's even humming a song to himself...!\nChanges statement from \"I remember la old man arrived not long after 'im.\" to \"I remember la old man arrived not long after 'im, just after 2 PM.\"Armstrong:\nI remember la old man arrived not long after 'im, just after 2 PM.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely sure about the time?\nArmstrong:\nWhen I think really 'ard, 1 am sure it was just after 2. Oui. It is la time I stop serving la lunch menu.\nJudge:\nQuite right. I always break for lunch when the restaurants are serving their specials. I've been known to wind up a case early just to make it on time! Hah hah!\nPhoenix:\n(I guess you should never get between a hungry judge and his lunch...)\nJudge:\nOh, would you look at that! It's almost lunchtime already.\nPhoenix:\nWitness! Get on with your testimony, please!Present Millionaire Radio Flyer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I'm afraid I've finally got you, Mr. Armstrong.\"Armstrong:\nZ'ere were no other customers.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo your only customers were Mr. Kudo and the victim?\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHow many times do you need to ask the same thing, Trite? You'd never catch me drinking the same blend twice!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGodot:\nYou're trying to establish the presence of a \"phony victim\" in the restaurant. But you're wasting your time. You can't grind bird seed to make coffee, if you catch my drift...\nPhoenix:\n(But there's a hole in this testimony somewhere! I'm sure of it!)Armstrong:\nWhen 'e got word 'e won la lottery, Mon. Elg became very excited.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid you see him?\nArmstrong:\nNon, I was in ze kitchen. But I 'eard 'im. I remember 'im shouting, \"Yes! 'Alf a million bucks!\"\nGodot:\nPresumably the defendant heard that too, then, correct?\nArmstrong:\nMaggey...? She looked like a poor little frightened dove!\nPhoenix:\nAnd what about Mr. Kudo?\nArmstrong:\nLa old man chocked on some bird seed z'at got stuck in 'is throat.\nJudge:\nHmm... It seems we now have yet another incident on our hands.Armstrong:\nIt was approximately 5 minutes later z'at la poisoning incident occurred.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd what were you doing at that point? Without any customers, you must have had time to kill.\nArmstrong:\nI am multi-talented woman, monsieur!\nPhoenix:\nSorry? What do you mean?\nArmstrong:\nZ'ere is la renowned chef, Jean Armstrong, and la tragic poet, Claurice Armstrong.\nJudge:\nC-C-Claurice...?\nArmstrong:\nOui. I was writing a poem. An angry tale of a chef in 'alf a million dollars of debt... ...cooking for a man who won 'alf a million dollars on la lottery! It is called, \"Pourquoi\". It means, \"Why\". Per'aps I could recite it for la court?\nPhoenix:\nPlease don't...Present Millionaire Radio Flyer (after changing second statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I'm afraid I've finally got you, Mr. Armstrong.\"Armstrong:\nNon, z'ere was no time for a phony to do la acting.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou mean you contacted the police as soon as the incident occurred?\nArmstrong:\nI asked la old man to call from la pay phone.\nGodot:\nBy your own argument, Trite... ...the purpose of this \"phony victim's\" performance was so the old man would see it. In other words... ...once the incident occurred, this opportunity would completely disappear.\nJudge:\nIndeed.\nArmstrong:\nBien. It seems la shadow of doubt 'as been lifted, n'est-ce pas?\nPhoenix:\n...Present Millionaire Radio Flyer (after changing second statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I'm afraid I've finally got you, Mr. Armstrong.\"Maya:\nI guess Mr. Armstrong is connected to this case, huh?Phoenix:\nAbsolutely. Someone was impersonating Mr. Elg, and I refuse to believe he was oblivious. He was there the whole time, after all.Maya:\nBut if you're right, wouldn't Maggey have noticed, too?Phoenix:\nShe fell unconscious when the incident occurred, remember?Maya:\nAh! You mean that's when the phony staged his act?Phoenix:\nWe'll know for sure once I find a hole in this testimony.Phoenix:\nI'm afraid I've finally got you, Mr. Armstrong.Armstrong:\nQ-Quoi? What do you mean?Phoenix:\nAt the time in question, the victim was listening to the radio with his earpiece. The show he was listening to was \"Millionaire Radio\". Each week, they announce the winning number of a half million dollar lottery ticket.Armstrong:\nOui. Z'at must be la show Mon. Elg was listening to.Judge:\nI can't see any problem with this testimony, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nI wonder...Armstrong:\n...?Phoenix:\nYou say the victim arrived at your restaurant after 2 PM, correct?Armstrong:\nOui, oui. I am sure of it. I remember it perfectly now! I know it was z'at time, because I 'ad just finished serving la lunch menu.Godot:\nGet to the point, Trite. If you have one.Phoenix:\nThat show is broadcast live at 1:30 PM. And it claims to be \"the most thrilling 10 minutes of your life\"...Judge:\nI-It's on the air at 1:30!?Phoenix:\nNow, supposedly, the victim made some noise when it was announced that he had won. And yet... I don't believe his cry of joy could have occurred after 2 PM! Because the show had already finished more than 30 minutes earlier by that point in time!Armstrong:\nNooooooooon!Phoenix:\nThis \"victim\" we've been told about has done nothing but the impossible! Listening to the radio with a ruptured eardrum, catching a show that was already over... There is only one conclusion you can draw from these facts! This \"victim\" was an imposter, acting out the poisoning 30 minutes after the real murder! Yes, there were two Glen Elgs in Tr\u00e9s Bien that day. The real Glen Elg, now dead, having been poisoned by the real killer... ...and the phony Glen Elg, acting out the events for Mr. Kudo to witness!Judge:\nI-It certainly seems that way... I mean, if that wasn't the case, how could you explain the time discrepancy?Godot:Godot:\nQuite a performance, Trite. You were almost on a roll.Phoenix:\n...!Godot:\nBut sadly, you lack the rock hard foundation of rhythm to build your song!Phoenix:\n(...What is this? Music Theory 101?)Godot:\nLet's recap. According to your \"imaginative\" theory, it's now just after 2 PM... The phony Elg is performing a play for the benefit of Mr. Kudo. How do you explain then, where the real Glen Elg is!?Phoenix:\nI don't believe I have to spell this out for court! However! At that time, the real Glen Elg was already dead!Judge:\nThat's certainly the obvious conclusion.Godot:Godot:\nThank you, Trite. That's exactly what I was hoping you would say.Phoenix:\nWh-What!?Godot:\nNow, I presume you can prove this theory of yours...? Can you explain where the missing corpse went to!?Phoenix:\nTh-The missing corpse...?Godot:\nAccording to the old man's testimony, there was only one other customer there. If that \"customer\" was the phony Glen Elg... ...then where did the killer hide the body of the real victim!?Phoenix:\nNaaaaaargh!Judge:\nThe prosecution has a valid point, Mr. Wright. If your theory is to stand up to examination by the court... ...you must provide us with proof by answering the prosecution's question. Where did the killer hide the body?Phoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor...Godot:\nNo conjecture, Trite. Let's hear some facts for once. Show the court a piece of evidence that proves where the body was hidden!Phoenix:\nE-Evidence!?Maya:\nWh-What's with the intense pressure in here all of a sudden!?Phoenix:\n(I thought I had him with that contradiction. But he's turned it all around and backed me into a corner instead!)Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? The court will now hear the defense's theory and evidence. First, where was the body of the real Mr. Elg concealed?Outside Tr\u00e9s Bien\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nClearly, there's no place to hide a body inside Tr\u00e9s Bien. Therefore, the killer must have hauled the body outside!\nJudge:\nHmm... I see.\nGodot:\nNice supposition. But the real question is, \"Can you back it up?\" Where's the evidence that proves the body was hidden in that location!?\n\n\n\nPresent anything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nGodot:\nToo bad... I don't think you'll ever grasp the real heart of Rock'n'Roll.\nPhoenix:\nWhat are you talking about?\nJudge:\nHe means that your evidence is irrelevant, Mr. Wright!\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! You've got to think it through! Feel the beat! And then hit him with some heavy metal!\nPhoenix:\n(OK, I need to calm down and get my facts straight. What should I do now?)\n\n\n\nStart over\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI-I think I need to clear my head...\nGodot:\nHa...! I'd say it's already empty, Trite!\nJudge:\nI'm inclined to agree.\nArmstrong:\nYo tambi\u00e9n.\nPhoenix:\n(What's with the Spanish all of a sudden!?)\nLeads back to:\n\"Well, Mr. Wright? The court will now hear the defense's theory and evidence.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent more evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(There's nothing wrong with my logic so far, I'm sure of it! I'll hit them with another piece of evidence and see if that helps...)\nLeads back to:\n\"Clearly, there's no place to hide a body inside Tr\u00e9s Bien.\"Inside Tr\u00e9s Bien\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt'd would [sic] have been too dangerous to take the body outside. Obviously, the body must have been hidden somewhere inside Tr\u00e9s Bien.\nJudge:\nHmm... Interesting... But where could a body have been hidden inside a restaurant? Perhaps you would care to show the court on these plans, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. The exact location where the body was concealed inside Tr\u00e9s Bien is...\n\n\n\nPresent anywhere\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe body was hidden here!\nJudge:\nHmm... I see.\nGodot:\nNice supposition. But the real question is, \"Can you back it up?\" Where's the evidence that proves the body was hidden in that location!?\n\n\n\nPresent Small Bottle (after presenting Kitchen)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Armstrong! Do you recognize this bottle?\"\n\n\n\n\nOtherwise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nGodot:\nToo bad... I don't think you'll ever grasp the real heart of Rock'n'Roll.\nPhoenix:\nWhat are you talking about?\nJudge:\nHe means that your evidence is irrelevant, Mr. Wright!\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! You've got to think it through! Feel the beat! And then hit him with some heavy metal!\nPhoenix:\n(OK, I need to calm down and get my facts straight.

The court will now hear the defense's theory and evidence.\"\n\n\n\n\nPick another location\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(There's nothing wrong with my logic so far, I'm sure of it! I'll have another go at proving where the body was hidden.)\nLeads back to:\n\"It'd would have been too dangerous to take the body outside.\"Phoenix:\nMr. Armstrong! Do you recognize this bottle?Armstrong:\nNon! Non, non, non! I 'ave never seen z'at ugly bottle before in my life! I only use la very best bottles, monsieur! Z'e 'ighest quality only for me!Judge:\nWhere was that bottle found, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nInterestingly enough, Your Honor. it was found in the kitchen of Tr\u00e9s Bien.Armstrong:\nEh? Quoi!? But I only ever use z'ese bottles for my aromatherapy oils.Phoenix:\nBut this bottle doesn't contain aromatherapy oil, Mr. Armstrong. No, it contains a medication.Judge:\nWhat kind of medication?Phoenix:\nI'm sure everyone remembers, don't they? That Mr. Elg visited an otolaryngological clinic, and was given medication that day!Godot:\nY-You can't be serious...Phoenix:\nThe defense had the contents of the bottle analyzed, and I have the lab results here! The contents of the bottle match the prescription that was given to Mr. Elg!Godot:\nBwooooar!Phoenix:\nGlen Elg's murderer hid the body in the restaurant kitchen. At which time, this bottle fell out of the victim's pocket. Mr. Armstrong! When the incident occurred, didn't you say you were in the kitchen?Armstrong:\nM-M-Mon dieu!Phoenix:\nYes, you know about what I'm about to say, It was YOU who hid the victim's body! You did a fine job pretending to defend my client, Maggey Byrde. However! You were setting her up to take the fall behind the poor girl's back!Armstrong:\nNooooooooon!Judge:\nO-Order! Order! This is an extraordinary development. Witness! Did you... Did you murder Mr. Glen Elg?Armstrong:\nNever! I could not do such an 'orrible thing!Godot:\nNoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!Judge:\nM-Mr. Godot!?Godot:\n...The bitterness... Every time I get lied to, I always down a mug of coffee. ...That's one of my rules.Phoenix:\n(Do you have the slightest idea how many cups you've had by now...?)Godot:\nThen I like to do the same to the person who lied to me. I like to take them down with my empty cup! Listen up, chef! How about a brand new flavor in your ear, my \"h\" deficient friend?Armstrong:\nJe vous demande pardon! Please, you must 'ear me out! It is a trap! Listen to me! Por favor!Judge:\nYo hablo Espa\u00f1ol, Mr. Armstrong, and \"Por favor\" is Spanish.Godot:\nI'm only going to ask you once. Did you do it?Armstrong:\nNon! Non, non! Absolutely non! I simply... I...Godot:\nLet's hear it. You've got one shot. Right, gramps?Judge:\nWitness! The court will permit you the chance to make one final statement. If you lie under oath again, Mr. Godot's coffee mug awaits you... As does my gavel!Armstrong:\nO-Oui... It is clear.Phoenix:\n(What do they always say in the movies...? \"I've got a bad feeling about this...\"?)Judge:\nVery well! Begin your final testimony, Mr. Armstrong!Witness Testimony-- The Confession --Armstrong:\nIt is true, I 'id la body in la kitchen.\nA man forced me to do it.

By who!?Armstrong:\nI-I cannot say! Or I will be... erased!Phoenix:\nLet's try a different question then. When Mr. Elg died, was he really the only person at his table?Armstrong:\n... Z'ere was... Z'ere was another man.Phoenix:\n(I knew it!)Maya:\nMaggey was telling the truth!Judge:\nYou may cross-examine the witness now, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\n(There's just one more thing I need to do.

That's got to be a lie right there! It's time I nailed this guy!)Witness Testimony-- The Victim, Glen Elg --Tigre:\nI ain't no liar. I never met Glen Elg.\nThere was some lame guy with that name, though. Wanted to borrow cash from me.\nI set up a meetin' with the guy... at my office, Tender Lender.\nI waited around for him, but he ain't ever showed.\nI ain't never been to that Tr\u00e9s Bien joint, youse hear?Judge:\nI see... That all seems perfectly logical. You had arranged to meet with the victim, but he didn't show up.Godot:\nI've heard it's pretty hard to keep appointments when you're dead.Judge:\nVery well. You may begin your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor!Tigre:\nDidn't I tell you I got a big deal goin' down today? I ain't gonna make my bus now.

If you wouldn't mind going into a bit more detail...\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nThis is a dead end, Trite, and you know it. Remember the rules!\nJudge:\nPressing the witness without evidence to back up your attack is prohibited. As I said earlier, the court will impose a penalty for such behavior!\nPhoenix:\n(Ouch. The pain...)\nLeads to:\n\"Now then, Mr. Tigre...\"\n\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(It's too dangerous to press things without knowing where they might end up. I'd better just focus on gathering information at the moment...)\nLeads to:\n\"Now then, Mr. Tigre...\"\n\n\nJudge:\nNow then, Mr. Tigre... Would you mind repeating your testimony from the beginning, please?\nTigre:\nMy time ain't free, you' hear? Youse betta remember dat! If I miss that bus, someone's gonna pay!\nPhoenix:\nNngh...Tigre:\nYouse wanna check my alibi, just ask Violetta.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBy \"Violetta\", you're talking about the Cadaverini family's...?\nTigre:\nYeah. You' don't wanna cross them, or youse gonna wind up sleepin' with de fishes. Once the Godfather finds out youse been draggin' Violetta through the mud... ...he'll... do you... in...\nPhoenix:\n... Sorry, I... I couldn't quite put it all together towards the end there...\nMaya:\nHe said that just like Viola, didn't he?\nPhoenix:\n(I get the feeling this might not be the right time to probe him about her...)\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. Tigre!\nTigre:\nWhad'youse want!?\nPhoenix:\nErr...

If I miss that bus, someone's gonna pay!\nPhoenix:\nNngh...Maya:\nJust think! All you have to do is press him on something irrelevant, and bam! $50,000!Phoenix:\nGet real, Maya! How about you pay back the money then. Your allowance should cover it!Maya:\nHey! I'm no idiot, you know!Phoenix:\n(Well, I'M certainly not the one who thought the $50,000 was free money!) Anyway, I need to work this guy without pressing his testimony too hard.Maya:\nBut his testimony is pretty solid as it is...Phoenix:\n(I admit nothing jumps out at me as a contradiction. But I've got to find an opening somewhere... Or I need to make one.)Phoenix:\nMr. Tigre... You claim you didn't know Mr. Glen Elg. But it appears that Mr. Elg knew you.Tigre:\nWhat!?Phoenix:\nMr. Elg left this little note on his calendar. \"Meet with The Tiger\"... And the date? December 3rd. (Changed from ['Meet with The Tiger'... Dated, December 3rd.] in the original release)Judge:\nD-December 3rd!? That's... the day of the murder!Phoenix:\nSo, Mr. Tigre, I submit that you did indeed know one Mr. Glen Elg! Because on the very day of the incident, you met with him!Tigre:\n... Grrrah ha ha ha hah! Not bad! Youse actually not bad.Phoenix:\nS-Sorry?Tigre:\nI was just messin' with youse to see how good you' were.Maya:\nDid you hear that, Nick? He said you're not bad!Phoenix:\n(That's one compliment I can do without! Plus, he's lying through his teeth!)Judge:\nUm, witness. Please remember that you're under oath. Lies will not be tolerated.Tigre:\nYouse callin' me a liar!? Is that what you' doin'!?Judge:\nRuh-roh!Godot:\nSo you're saying that your claim to have \"never seen that kid before\" is the truth?Tigre:\nI said I'm dead serious! Youse betta believe that's the truth!Godot:\nHa...! Then I'd say that gives me time... to enjoy another cup of pure black magic! That is, while you testify for the court again, Mr. Tigre.Judge:\nOh, yes! Um, would you mind indulging the court, witness?Phoenix:\n(He never actually met the victim!? That's got to be a lie right there! It's time I nailed this guy!)Witness Testimony-- The Victim, Glen Elg --Tigre:\nI ain't no liar. I never met Glen Elg.\nThere was some lame guy with that name, though. Wanted to borrow cash from me.\nI set up a meetin' with the guy... at my office, Tender Lender.\nI waited around for him, but he ain't ever showed.\nI ain't never been to that Tr\u00e9s Bien joint, youse hear?Judge:\nI see... That all seems perfectly logical. You had arranged to meet with the victim, but he didn't show up.Godot:\nI've heard it's pretty hard to keep appointments when you're dead.Judge:\nVery well. You may begin your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor!Tigre:\nDidn't I tell you I got a big deal goin' down today? I ain't gonna make my bus now. I'm gonna have to take the express train. That bill's goin' straight to you... Wright!Phoenix:\nGrr...Cross Examination",

Yesterday's session didn't go so well, and then ended on a giant mystery.Phoenix:\n(That's true... And we still haven't solved a single part of it yet...)Maya:\nAre you OK, Nick?Phoenix:\nHuh? Oh, uh... Yeah. Of course.Byrde:\nI saw that! That little flash of doubt in your eyes!Phoenix:\nN-No! That wasn't doubt. That was, umm... determination!Byrde:\nWhy don't I believe you...?Maya:\nIt's nearly time, Maggey. You'd better get going to the defendant's seat.Byrde:\nRoger. Don't let me down, Mr. Wright. I'm counting on you!Hey, pal!Phoenix:\nHey, Detective Gumshoe...Gumshoe:\nQuit stressing Maggey out! She doesn't need that!Phoenix:\nH-How did you know she was stressed...?Gumshoe:\nI was watching through the doorway.Phoenix:\nOh...Gumshoe:\nYou look like you lost the case already. Show a bit of confidence, will you, pal!? Here, maybe this'll help.Maya:\nHuh!? Have you taken up aromatherapy, too?Gumshoe:\nNot in a million years, pal! Don't tell me that you don't remember this thing?Phoenix:\n(Hmm... Come to think of it, that doesn't look like one of those aromatherapy bottles...)Gumshoe:\nThis is the small bottle that turned up in Tr\u00e9s Bien's kitchen a couple of days ago.Maya:\nWow! Look at all these little bottles!Phoenix:\nOh! They're aromatherapy oils! He's got so many, they're overflowing onto the floor...Maya:\nHey, wait a minute... There's one bottle that's different from all the others.Phoenix:\nWell what do you know. And it doesn't have a label either.Maya:\nAnd... *sniff* It doesn't smell.Gumshoe:\nWe finally got the analysis results back from the lab.Maya:\nSo!? What is it? Is it the poison?Gumshoe:\nI'm afraid not, pal. It's... medication.Maya:\nMedication?Gumshoe:\nYeah. For ears. Topical use only, apparently.Phoenix:\nFor ears? You mean...?Gumshoe:\nYeah. It's the medication Glen Elg was using for his ruptured eardrum!Phoenix:\n(What was Glen Elg's ear medicine doing in the kitchen...?)Small Bottle refiled into the Court Record.Phoenix:\nUm, what about the unidentified fingerprints? Anything on that?Gumshoe:\nSomeone screwed up, so they only had time to analyze the contents of the bottle. Another hour and they might have gotten something on the prints, but...Phoenix:\n(Hmm... That's going to weaken its impact as a piece of evidence...)Gumshoe:\nOK, pal! This is it! Make sure your defense is impregnable today, got it!?Phoenix:\n(Today's trial... I'm gonna expose that guy for what he's done, or my name isn't Phoenix Wright!)January 8, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Maggey Byrde.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Godot:\nReady and waiting as always, Your Honor.Judge:\nVery good. Then we'll get underway at once. Yesterday we heard the testimony of Mr. Victor Kudo. He claims to have witnessed the defendant putting a powder into the victim's coffee. However, the witness's testimony was plagued with a number of problems.Godot:\nThe mark on the rim of the cup shows that the victim drank from it with his right hand. But according to the old man's testimony, he picked it up with his left hand.Judge:\nThank you, Mr. Godot. Furthermore, according to the witness's account... ...the victim was listening to the radio with an earpiece in his left ear. Yet, the victim's left eardrum was ruptured, which made him effectively deaf in that ear.Maya:\nIt's amazing how many contradictions a single case can have, huh Nick?Godot:\nHa...! Allow me to enlighten you, Your Honor. The world, you see, keeps turning, and we must turn with it.Judge:\n... You've lost me already, Mr. Godot.Godot:\nDon't let the mysteries of yesterday mystify you today. Only losers think like that. You've got to change with the times! That's one of my rules!Judge:\nAre you implying that you've resolved these contradictions? You know the answers to these riddles!?Godot:\nThe old guy wasn't just throwing seed in here. He was throwing us off the scent. And today I'll prove it.Judge:\nVery well. Let the first witness take the stand!Godot:\nAnd you are?Armstrong:\nOh bonjour, everyone! I am Jean Armstrong. z'e owner and 'ead chef of la Tr\u00e9s Bien restaurant. Enchant\u00e9!.........Judge:\nForgive me for asking, witness, but... are you a woman?Armstrong:\nOh l\u00e0 l\u00e0, monsieur! As you can see, I am la pert and perky gentleman, non?Judge:\nEr... Umm...Godot:\nOn the day of the incident, you were in Tr\u00e9s Bien's kitchen. Isn't that right?Armstrong:\nW'iz you monsieur...Godot:\n...?Armstrong:\n...everything feels right!Godot:\nHa...!Phoenix:\n(Wow, he's totally unfazed! Doesn't anything intimidate this guy...?)Judge:\nVery well. Your testimony please, witness. Please tell the court what happened that day at Tr\u00e9s Bien.Armstrong:\nOui! Volontiers!Witness Testimony-- At Tr\u00e9s Bien --Armstrong:\nWhen it all 'appened, z'ere were just two customers in my restaurant.\nI remember I was experimenting w'iz some new art deco z'at day.\nLike 'aving a large mirror between la tables, for example.\nOui! Per'aps z'at is what la old man was looking at.\nLa cup, la earpiece, and la glasses... 'E would 'ave seen everyz'ing in reverse, non?Phoenix:\nA m...m...m... MIRROR!?Armstrong:\nOui! Un grand mirror! La most enormous mirror!Godot:\nAnd suddenly, the mystery disappears! Like I said, the world keeps turning, so roll with it!Judge:\nHmm... That would explain the coffee cup and the earpiece conundrum... The mirror would have made everything appear back to front.Phoenix:\n(What the heck!? It's way too early in the morning for this to be happening to me!)Judge:\nNow then, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- At Tr\u00e9s Bien --Armstrong:\nWhen it all 'appened, z'ere were just two customers in my restaurant.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd who were the two customers, exactly?\nArmstrong:\nMais, of course. La young man who died... ...and la other, not-so-young, man.\nJudge:\nHmm... You are referring to yesterday's witness, I presume?\nPhoenix:\n(What about the other man Maggey says she saw at the table? Something tells me Mr. Armstrong isn't planning to disclose his existence...)\nMaya:\nWe need some hard evidence first before we can bring him up, don't we...?\nPhoenix:\nI guess I'll just have to try a different approach for the time being.Armstrong:\nI remember I was experimenting w'iz some new art deco z'at day.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou were experimenting with art deco? How come I never heard about that before today?\nArmstrong:\nYou are not familiar w'iz z'e language of interior design, monsieur?\nPhoenix:\nPlease stay on topic! Now, why didn't you tell the court about this before!?\nArmstrong:\nBut I did. Just a few moments ago!\nJudge:\nAhem! Excuse me, Mr. Armstrong. This \"deco\" you mentioned... Are you referring to some sort of \"decocture\"?\nPhoenix:\nNo, no! Art deco, it is a style of design! ...Your Honor. He's talking about interior design. Walls, ceilings, carpets, that kind of thing.\nJudge:\nAh, yes. Of course. That \"deco\".\nArmstrong:\nI was trying to achieve a more \"la effeminate\" look for my restaurant. I was planning z'e most bold remodeling of la decor.Armstrong:\nLike 'aving a large mirror between la tables, for example.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow big of a mirror are we talking about here?\nArmstrong:\nBof! Something about 4 meters wide and, err... Oui. About 2 meters 'igh.\nPhoenix:\n(Let's see... If 1 meter is about 1 yard... Holy glass in a frame, that's huge!)\nArmstrong:\nI was intending to install it on la ceiling eventually.\nPhoenix:\nThe ceiling!? (Was there a mirror on the ceiling!? I don't remember...)\nArmstrong:\nMais, non. But I decided not to go through w'iz it in z'e end.\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I ask him more about the mirror or not?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(He couldn't lie about such a huge object like that. It must've been there in the restaurant somewhere.)\nGodot:\n...\nLeads to:\n\"Hmm... So the witness yesterday had seen the victim reflected in a mirror...\"\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIf you really had such a large mirror in the restaurant, someone would have noticed it! But there's nothing about a mirror in Mr. Kudo or Maggey Byrde's testimonies!\nArmstrong:\nB-But...\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nYou didn't ask, Trite. You have only yourself to blame for such sloppy work.\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nGodot:\nA mirror was delivered to Tr\u00e9s Bien the day before the incident.\nPhoenix:\nR-Really?\nGodot:\nAs Mr. Armstrong testified, he was carrying out some design changes. And as it turned out, he didn't actually use the mirror in the end.\nPhoenix:\n(This just doesn't add up. Even if a mirror was delivered to Tr\u00e9s Bien... ...it doesn't prove that it was in the restaurant on the day of the crime.)\nGodot:\nHa...! If you want to doubt someone, Trite, look in the mirror. I'm sure the person looking back at you will be dubious enough!\nLeads to:\n\"Hmm... So the witness yesterday had seen the victim reflected in a mirror...\"\n\n\nJudge:\nHmm... So the witness yesterday had seen the victim reflected in a mirror...Armstrong:\nOui! Per'aps z'at is what la old man was looking at.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nNormally, I'd expect people to know the difference between a reflection and a real object.\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\n\"Normally\"? How does normality come into this? That's lame, Trite. Even for you.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGodot:\nAre you trying to say that if something isn't normal, it isn't possible? Is that it? Where does that leave the porcu-headed lawyer and the topknot chick over there... and the ungodly cool guy with the mask over here? Well, Trite!?\nPhoenix:\nAaack! Not the hair!\nMaya:\nI do not have a topknot!\nJudge:\nMr. Godot is correct. A lack of normality is no basis for discounting an argument.\nArmstrong:\nBien! Logic 'as won la day!Armstrong:\nLa cup, la earpiece, and la glasses... 'E would 'ave seen everyz'ing in reverse, non?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nEverything? He would have seen everything in reverse?\nArmstrong:\nOui.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick... We should take a sec and think about what Old Seedy said in his testimony...\nPhoenix:\n(How did he phrase it again...?)\n\n\nKudo:\nThe boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs.\n\n\nKudo:\nNo question! You can lock me up if I'm wrong! It was his left ear, without a doubt!\n\n\nKudo:\nAnd then he used the same hand to pick up the cup. His left hand!\n\n\nMaya:\nIf he saw everything he described reflected in a mirror... ...then everything he said he saw on the \"left\" was actually on the \"right\", huh.\nPhoenix:\n(And that clears up all the problems with his testimony, I guess... Or does it...?)\nGodot:\nHa...!Present Glen Elg profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The coffee cup, the earpiece, and the HMD...\"Phoenix:\n(It's kinda hard to believe everything's the fault of a mirror, but...)Maya:\nDo you think Old Seedy saw everything through a reflection...?Phoenix:\nIf he did, it would explain all the contradictions in his testimony.Maya:\nBut that just makes the situation worse for Maggey! There's gotta be something in that old man's testimony! We've just gotta dig deeper!Phoenix:\nThe coffee cup, the earpiece, and the HMD... Let's think back over Mr. Kudo's testimony for a second, shall we?Kudo:\nThe boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs.Kudo:\nNo question! You can lock me up if I'm wrong! It was his left ear, without a doubt!Phoenix:\nSo, to summarize... ...we were told both the HMD and the earpiece were on the victim's left side. Now, if Mr. Kudo saw all that as a reflection in a mirror... ...it means both the HMD and the earpiece were actually on the victim's right side.Armstrong:\nExactement! You see, monsieur. Now z'at you think about it, it is not so 'ard, non?Phoenix:\nUnfortunately, that's where we run into a monumental contradiction with the facts! If Mr. Kudo really did see everything in a mirror... ...why is it that the HMD is now on the wrong side of his head!?Judge:\nOrder! Order! ...Mr. Wright is correct! If the witness genuinely observed the victim reflected in a mirror... ...then we would expect the victim's eyepiece to have been over his right eye.Godot:Godot:\n...How bitter. Trite, you should have a taste of this bitterness. It'll calm you down in no time.Phoenix:\nA-Are we talking about your coffee... or something completely different...?Godot:\nYou don't understand the way the witness thinks.Judge:\nHow he thinks?Godot:\nYou remember this, I presume?Phoenix:\nThe \"I broke the vase... sorry\" apology lett-- I mean Mr. Kudo's sworn testimony?Godot:\nExactly. The old man has one very grievous habit... other than throwing seeds. The more of an impression something makes, the more muddled his mind makes it. And what's the most striking thing about Mr. Elg?Judge:\nClearly, it's the victim's eyepiece.Godot:\nAnd that's my point. The old man strikes again! Mr. Elg's HMD made a big impression on the old man. \"I saw the earpiece and those new-fangled spectacles he was wearing! Oh, yes! They were both on his left ear! Do you hear? His left ear!\" Ha...! Well, Trite?Phoenix:\nUrk... (That's the worst, but best impression of Kudo ever...)Maya:\nWow! I really thought he was Old Seedy for a minute there! Godot's good!Judge:\nEnough! I must agree that yesterday's witness was irresponsibly rash in much of his testimony.Maya:\nBad luck, Nick. Looks like the \"boil\" of a contradiction you found is just a \"rash\".Godot:\nA mirror can't be beaten by a handful of seeds, nor can it lie. So... What exactly was the old man looking at? Fill us in, Mr. Armstrong. Go on, tell the court. We're all ears.Armstrong:\nOui. I can explain. Please, if you will look at la plans of la restaurant.Witness Testimony-- The Mirror --Armstrong:\nAlors. Is everyone sitting comfortably?\nLa mirror, it was in z'e middle of la restaurant, dividing z'e two 'alves.\nZ'ere is only one seat from which you could 'ave seen an image of la victim.\nZ'at was la seat at z'e table next to la victim's. Z'at was where la old man was sitting.\nAfter la terrible incident occurred, I move la mirror so it was not in z'e way.\nBut naturally, I did not touch anything else!Judge:\nHmm... I see no problems with the explanation we have just heard. From the table next to the victim's, Mr. Kudo could have seen the victim in the mirror.Armstrong:\nWhat a naughty little coquette I am, confusing all z'e men like z'is!Godot:\nDon't worry about it. We can keep up, except for the guy breaking out in a cold sweat over there again.Phoenix:\n(Argh! I hate that guy!)Judge:\nYou said you didn't touch anything else apart from the mirror. Are you quite sure about that?Armstrong:\nVolontiers! Of course!Judge:\nVery well. Mr. Wright. Your cross-examination, if you please.Cross Examination-- The Mirror --Armstrong:\nLa mirror, it was in z'e middle of la restaurant, dividing z'e two 'alves.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, run this by me again. The mirror was here, correct?\nArmstrong:\nOui.\nPhoenix:\nOui? Really!? Because I know if I were you, I wouldn't have put a mirror there! It would be in the way!\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nLook who's talking, Trite.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGodot:\nYou're obstructing my view, among other things.\nPhoenix:\nBut, but, but! This is my seat in the courtroom...!\nGodot:\nTr\u00e9s Bien's \"charm\" is that it gives you the impression that you're the only customer. Temporarily placing a mirror in that spot would hardly be \"in the way\". Unlike you... Trite.\nArmstrong:\nI tell you, monsieur. la mirror was z'ere, in z'e middle of la restaurant.Armstrong:\nZ'ere is only one seat from which you could 'ave seen an image of la victim.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd where would that be!?\nArmstrong:\nOh l\u00e1 l\u00e1! Look 'ow you lean towards me! I always attract z'e younger boys! Maybe I should keep you in suspense a little longer!\nJudge:\nMr. Armstrong! Tell the court what you know at once!\nArmstrong:\nI attract z'e older ones, too, you know, 'andsome! Shall I tease you, too!?\nJudge:\nNnngh...\nGodot:\nI'm already seeing a very hot someone, so I'm afraid you'll be waiting for a long time.\nMaya:\nI bet she has mocha-cream skin and cappuccino perfume.\nArmstrong:\nBien. I will tell you... Z'ere was only one seat from which you could 'ave seen...Armstrong:\nZ'at was la seat at z'e table next to la victim's. Z'at was where la old man was sitting.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo why can you only see the victim from that particular seat?\nArmstrong:\nMais, monsieur. It is obvious, non? If you look at la plans you will understand. La victim would 'ave been reflected in la mirror like so. If you were sitting at la table next to 'im, you would see everything, non?\nMaya:\nSo that's the seat Old Seedy was sitting in on that day... ...when the poisoning happened.\nPhoenix:\n(The old man was sitting at the table next to the victim? Why does that seem kinda odd...?)Present Victor's Testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! Mr. Kudo's words yesterday strongly contradict Mr. Armstrong's testimony!\nJudge:\nThis is... the letter of apology that was written by Mr. Kudo, is it not?\nPhoenix:\nI realize it looks useless, Your Honor, but this is still testimony.\nGodot:\nHa...! I guess useless people are only really good at identifying useless things.\nJudge:\nWhat relevance does this scrap of paper have to the trial, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nMr. Kudo's testimony is actually very relevant to the question at hand, Your Honor! Because it very clearly contradicts with this piece of evidence!\n\n\n\nPresent Crime Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThis piece of evidence contradicts with testimony we have heard, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nThe crime photo...?\nPhoenix:\nYes. This photo clearly shows something that theoretically should not exist!\nJudge:\nWhat on Earth do you mean by that, Mr. Wright!?\nGodot:\n\"Should not exist\"? Ha... Sounds like you're describing yourself, Trite.\nJudge:\nNow then, if the defense would please clarify its statement. What is the something that \"should not exist\" in this photo?\n\n\n\nPresent vase on left table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"There is one thing that was clearly demonstrated by yesterday's testimony.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThis is what should not be in the picture!\nJudge:\nI'm sorry? I'm afraid you've lost me.\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nGodot:\nHa...! I suppose it's up to me to clarify the defense's claim. The something that \"shouldn't exist\" is clearly...\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait, wait, wait! I've change my mind, Your Honor! (The last thing I need right now is a scalding hot coffee shower...)\nJudge:\nVery well. Gather your thoughts, Mr. Wright. In the meantime, the witness will repeat his testimony for the court.\nArmstrong:\nOui. I would be delighted!\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nWell... ...I'm not sure the contradiction... ...is as clear as you would have us believe, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n...Oh.\nJudge:\nPerhaps you should reconsider before you try again, hm?\nPhoenix:\nTry again...? (You mean I was wrong?)\nJudge:\nVery well. Gather your thoughts, Mr. Wright. In the meantime, the witness will repeat his testimony for the court.\nArmstrong:\nOui.

Exactement. I carried it out of la restaurant z'en.\nPhoenix:\nYou moved a huge mirror like that all by yourself?\nArmstrong:\nWhat can I say? I know 'ow to pick things up, 'andsome!\nPhoenix:\n...\nGodot:\nHeh heh...\nMaya:\nG-Godot actually laughed at something!\nJudge:\nWell, given the witness's physique, I suppose it is possible. Did you move anything else from the crime scene, Mr. Armstrong?\nArmstrong:\nI look like z'e obliging type, non?Armstrong:\nBut naturally, I did not touch anything else!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure about that?\nArmstrong:\nI touched nothing except la mirror!\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright? Is there something the witness has said that doesn't match the crime scene?\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, there is... I just can't put my finger on what exactly.)\nGodot:\nHa...! Suffering from a case of heartburn, Trite?\nArmstrong:\nOh, I 'ave just z'e thing for z'at! An oil with golden myrrh and frankenstaince...\nGodot:\nAdd a few drops to your coffee, and voila!

In the meantime, the witness will repeat his testimony for the court.\nArmstrong:\nOui. I would be delighted!\nLeads back to cross-examinationMaya:\nIt is pretty strange, though, isn't it? I mean, nobody mentioned anything about a really large mirror. You'd think someone would've, but Maggey didn't, and neither did Old Seedy.Phoenix:\nThen the only logical explanation is... ...that there was no mirror inside Tr\u00e9s Bien that day. (Now I've just got to prove it... Somehow...)Phoenix:\nThere is one thing that was clearly demonstrated by yesterday's testimony. Mr. Kudo broke the vase that was on the table where he was sitting. And yet! As the court can see, there is an unbroken vase on the table next to the victim! Why? Because Mr. Kudo was not, in fact, sitting at the table next to the victim at all!Godot:Godot:\nDon't be an idiot, Trite! That's impossible! That seat's the only one Kudo could've seen the victim's reflection from!Phoenix:\nExactly!Godot:\n...!Phoenix:\nThere is only one conclusion we can draw from this contradiction. There was no mirror in Tr\u00e9s Bien that day! Your testimony, Mr. Armstrong, is an elaborate lie!Armstrong:\nMon dieeeeeeeu!Godot:Godot:\nDon't try to confuse the court, Trite! Obviously, the witness cleaned up the vase... ...while the police were taking their time getting to the crime scene!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nUnfortunately, Mr. Godot, that doesn't quite work for me. Mr. Armstrong already testified to the contrary. In his own words... \"I did not touch anything else\" except the mirror!Godot:\nUr... urgh! ... Gaaaaaaaaargh!Judge:\nWell, witness? What do you have to say for yourself?Armstrong:\n*sniffle*Phoenix:\n(I was right! There was no mirror in the restaurant that day!)Judge:\nIn light of this revelation, we return back to the original problem. Why did the victim have an earpiece in an ear in which he couldn't hear?Godot:\nHa...! You only get one shot in life. There's no turning back. If you want to claim that the mirror wasn't there, Trite... ...then this problem is all yours. How do you explain what the old man saw?Phoenix:\n(If I can answer this, then I'll be that much closer to the truth! I can feel it!)Maya:\n...Are you going to be OK? Can you really solve this contradiction, Nick?Phoenix:\nThere's more than just this one contradiction, Maya.Maya:\nWhat do you mean?Phoenix:\nRemember what Maggey told us? \"There was another man at the victim's table.\" And, \"there was a sample CD on the victim's table.\" It all flies in the face of Mr. Kudo's testimony. (And I think I know the reason why nothing in this case is adding up.)Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Let's hear your answer.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. The reason behind all the contradictions in Mr. Kudo's testimony is simple.Mr. Kudo made a mistake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nClearly, Mr. Kudo made a mistake!\nGodot:\nMr. Trite... You're the one who brought up all these contradictions.\nPhoenix:\nAnd...?\nGodot:\nIf you're trying to tell us the old man just made a mistake... ...we can wrap up this case right now with a guilty verdict!\nJudge:\nHow about it, Mr. Wright? Should I just declare your client guilty?\nMaya:\nIs that the best you can come up with, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm sorry, Your Honor. I was the one who made a mistake.\nJudge:\nI'll give you one more chance, Mr. Wright. Think carefully before you answer this time!\nLeads back to:\n\"Yes, Your Honor.\"The ear doctor made a mistake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI believe we're looking at this the wrong way. It was actually the doctor's mistake.\nJudge:\nWhat?\nPhoenix:\nYes. The doctor got the wrong ear!\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nWell, I believe we saw an autopsy report yesterday. One that stated the victim's left eardrum was ruptured, and had medicine in it!\nJudge:\nI'm beginning to wonder if it's not your eardrum that's ruptured, Mr. Wright.\nMaya:\nThis is no time to be playing with people's perceptions, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm sorry, Your Honor. I was the one who made a mistake.\nJudge:\nI'll give you one more chance, Mr. Wright. Think carefully before you answer this time!\nLeads back to:\n\"Yes, Your Honor.\"The victim was a phony.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"This case is riddled with contradictions.\"Phoenix:\nThis case is riddled with contradictions. Yet, there is one very simple answer that clears them all up.Judge:\nA-And what is that?Phoenix:\nThe incident Mr. Kudo witnessed, and the incident the victim experienced... ...were two completely different events!Godot:\nWhat!?Phoenix:\nYes! The \"victim\" that Mr. Kudo saw wasn't Mr. Glen Elg at all! It was an imposter -- a phony pretending to be Mr. Elg! Obviously, unlike the victim, there was nothing wrong with the imposter's left eardrum. That's how he ended up wearing the earpiece in his left ear by mistake!Godot:\nPhwoooooooh!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Settle down, or I'll clear the courtroom!Godot:\nQuiet, gramps! Why don't you clear out of here, huh?Judge:\nWHAT DID YOU SAY!?Godot:\nTrite... Are you saying what Mr. Kudo saw was a set-up?Phoenix:\nYes. Someone pretended to be Glen Elg and acted out the whole coffee poisoning. All for the express purpose of creating a \"witness\" out of one Mr. Victor Kudo!Godot:Godot:\nGet real, Trite! Why would anyone want to do that?Phoenix:\nIsn't it obvious? The thing Mr. Kudo was most insistent about in his testimony was...Kudo:\nThe serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it! That's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well!Judge:\nI-It's so hard to believe, but...Phoenix:\nThere was one, and only one reason to show Mr. Kudo this fake poisoning! To show Maggey Byrde in the act of poisoning the coffee!Godot:Godot:\nAre you insinuating that the waitress in the old man's story was a fake as well? It's true that there were no customers in the restaurant at the time, but... ...it's also true that the chef was there! He would have noticed what was happening.Judge:\nTh-That's right! Well, witness? If your restaurant really was the scene of such theatrics... ...you would have known about it, correct!?Armstrong:\nOh l\u00e0 l\u00e0... Z'is is most difficult for me...Phoenix:Phoenix:\nNo, it's quite simple. All you have to do is testify. You are under oath, after all. Was there, in fact, a phony at Tr\u00e9s Bien that day!? The defense demands that Mr. Armstrong tell the whole truth about what happened.Judge:\nThe defense's request for additional testimony is accepted. You will accurately explain, in detail, the events in the restaurant that day!Armstrong:\nOu... Oui.Witness Testimony-- In the Restaurant --Armstrong:\nLa victim, Monsieur Elg, 'e came to my restaurant alone.\nI remember la old man arrived not long after 'im.\nZ'ere were no other customers.\nWhen 'e got word 'e won la lottery, Mon. Elg became very excited.\nIt was approximately 5 minutes later z'at la poisoning incident occurred.\nNon, z'ere was no time for a phony to do la acting.Judge:\n...Just so we're clear, there was no mirror in the restaurant, after all?Armstrong:\nJe vous demande pardon! Forgive me, Your Honor! I lied because I wanted z'is mess to be cleared up quickly.Judge:\nWhat you have just done is commit perjury, Mr. Armstrong! I will decide how to punish you later.Armstrong:\nO-Oui...Judge:\nFor now, we will hear your cross-examination. Mr. Wright, if you please. (Changed from [For now, we will hear your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.] in the original release)Phoenix:\n(Hmm.. He took that perjury charge a bit too well. But I'm guessing he'll be more serious trouble after this cross-examination!)Cross Examination-- In the Restaurant --Armstrong:\nLa victim, Monsieur Elg, 'e came to my restaurant alone.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWas he alone at his table as well?\nArmstrong:\nMais, oui. I saw 'im from la kitchen.\nPhoenix:\nYet the defendant, Ms. Byrde, remembers it differently. She swears there was another man at the victim's table.\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHa...! Unfortunately for you, Trite... ...yesterday's witness also testified that the victim was alone.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nYou know, seeing you squirm like that reminds me... ...of a certain coffee's bitter-sweet bite.\nPhoenix:\n(What kind of coffee has he been drinking!?)\nMaya:\nIt's not coffee, it's love! It's love that's bitter-sweet.\nPhoenix:\n(Hearing Maya say that makes her seem wise all of a sudden...)Armstrong:\nI remember la old man arrived not long after 'im.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBy old man, you mean Victor Kudo, correct?\nArmstrong:\nOui. 'E comes often for my special coffee.\nGodot:\nI drank your coffee once, Mr. Armstrong. It's special, I'll give you that. It's worth a sip just for the experience.\nArmstrong:\nOh, you make me so 'appy, monsieur! You are most welcome any time!\nGodot:\nI said it was worth one sip, and nothing more.\nPhoenix:\n(So old Mr. Kudo arrived at the restaurant around the same time as the victim. Maybe I should ask about his arrival in more detail.)\n\n\n\nDon't ask anything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(All I need to do is establish that this phony victim really existed. Asking more about the old man is only going to cloud the issue.) I think that's enough about coffee. Please continue with your testimony, Mr. Armstrong.\nArmstrong:\nYou are welcome any time too, Monsieur Wright. I'll brew something special for you!\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nHow many minutes after?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you're saying that not much time elapsed between when the victim and Mr. Kudo arrived?\nArmstrong:\nOui. Z'at is correct.\nPhoenix:\n(But that still leaves the possibility that something happened in that gap of time.) And by your recollection, how much time would you say elapsed?\nArmstrong:\nLet me see... Approximately 2 minutes, I would say.\nPhoenix:\nT-Two minutes!? That's all?\nJudge:\nHmm... It seems unlikely that anything untoward could have happened in such a short time.\nPhoenix:\n(Rats! I knew I shouldn't have pursued this line of questioning...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nWhat time is it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOut of curiosity, about what time was it when Mr. Kudo arrived?\nArmstrong:\nOh, no... I cannot remember, monsieur.\nJudge:\nHmm... I believe we were told by a witness yesterday...\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThe crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.\n\n\nJudge:\nDoes that perhaps jog your memory, witness?\nArmstrong:\nLa incident 'appened about 20 minutes after 'e arrived. So the victim must 'ave arrived between 2:00 PM and 2:10 PM, non?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Just after 2, huh...)\nArmstrong:\nThank you for your 'elp, in jogging my memory, monsieur. You are wonderful!\nJudge:\nHah hah hah! I can't sit here all the time and do nothing now, can I!? The time of day will be added to the witness's testimony.\nArmstrong:\nOui, Monsieur Judge. Everything I do, I do it for you!\nJudge:\nMerci bien. That's French, isn't it? Hah hah hah!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm glad at least one person is in a good mood...)\nMaya:\nH-He's even humming a song to himself...!\nChanges statement from \"I remember la old man arrived not long after 'im.\" to \"I remember la old man arrived not long after 'im, just after 2 PM.\"Armstrong:\nI remember la old man arrived not long after 'im, just after 2 PM.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely sure about the time?\nArmstrong:\nWhen I think really 'ard, 1 am sure it was just after 2. Oui. It is la time I stop serving la lunch menu.\nJudge:\nQuite right. I always break for lunch when the restaurants are serving their specials. I've been known to wind up a case early just to make it on time! Hah hah!\nPhoenix:\n(I guess you should never get between a hungry judge and his lunch...)\nJudge:\nOh, would you look at that! It's almost lunchtime already.\nPhoenix:\nWitness! Get on with your testimony, please!Present Millionaire Radio Flyer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I'm afraid I've finally got you, Mr. Armstrong.\"Armstrong:\nZ'ere were no other customers.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo your only customers were Mr. Kudo and the victim?\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHow many times do you need to ask the same thing, Trite? You'd never catch me drinking the same blend twice!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGodot:\nYou're trying to establish the presence of a \"phony victim\" in the restaurant. But you're wasting your time. You can't grind bird seed to make coffee, if you catch my drift...\nPhoenix:\n(But there's a hole in this testimony somewhere! I'm sure of it!)Armstrong:\nWhen 'e got word 'e won la lottery, Mon. Elg became very excited.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid you see him?\nArmstrong:\nNon, I was in ze kitchen. But I 'eard 'im. I remember 'im shouting, \"Yes! 'Alf a million bucks!\"\nGodot:\nPresumably the defendant heard that too, then, correct?\nArmstrong:\nMaggey...? She looked like a poor little frightened dove!\nPhoenix:\nAnd what about Mr. Kudo?\nArmstrong:\nLa old man chocked on some bird seed z'at got stuck in 'is throat.\nJudge:\nHmm... It seems we now have yet another incident on our hands.Armstrong:\nIt was approximately 5 minutes later z'at la poisoning incident occurred.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd what were you doing at that point? Without any customers, you must have had time to kill.\nArmstrong:\nI am multi-talented woman, monsieur!\nPhoenix:\nSorry? What do you mean?\nArmstrong:\nZ'ere is la renowned chef, Jean Armstrong, and la tragic poet, Claurice Armstrong.\nJudge:\nC-C-Claurice...?\nArmstrong:\nOui. I was writing a poem. An angry tale of a chef in 'alf a million dollars of debt... ...cooking for a man who won 'alf a million dollars on la lottery! It is called, \"Pourquoi\". It means, \"Why\". Per'aps I could recite it for la court?\nPhoenix:\nPlease don't...Present Millionaire Radio Flyer (after changing second statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I'm afraid I've finally got you, Mr. Armstrong.\"Armstrong:\nNon, z'ere was no time for a phony to do la acting.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou mean you contacted the police as soon as the incident occurred?\nArmstrong:\nI asked la old man to call from la pay phone.\nGodot:\nBy your own argument, Trite... ...the purpose of this \"phony victim's\" performance was so the old man would see it. In other words... ...once the incident occurred, this opportunity would completely disappear.\nJudge:\nIndeed.\nArmstrong:\nBien. It seems la shadow of doubt 'as been lifted, n'est-ce pas?\nPhoenix:\n...Present Millionaire Radio Flyer (after changing second statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I'm afraid I've finally got you, Mr. Armstrong.\"Maya:\nI guess Mr. Armstrong is connected to this case, huh?Phoenix:\nAbsolutely. Someone was impersonating Mr. Elg, and I refuse to believe he was oblivious. He was there the whole time, after all.Maya:\nBut if you're right, wouldn't Maggey have noticed, too?Phoenix:\nShe fell unconscious when the incident occurred, remember?Maya:\nAh! You mean that's when the phony staged his act?Phoenix:\nWe'll know for sure once I find a hole in this testimony.Phoenix:\nI'm afraid I've finally got you, Mr. Armstrong.Armstrong:\nQ-Quoi? What do you mean?Phoenix:\nAt the time in question, the victim was listening to the radio with his earpiece. The show he was listening to was \"Millionaire Radio\". Each week, they announce the winning number of a half million dollar lottery ticket.Armstrong:\nOui. Z'at must be la show Mon. Elg was listening to.Judge:\nI can't see any problem with this testimony, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nI wonder...Armstrong:\n...?Phoenix:\nYou say the victim arrived at your restaurant after 2 PM, correct?Armstrong:\nOui, oui. I am sure of it. I remember it perfectly now! I know it was z'at time, because I 'ad just finished serving la lunch menu.Godot:\nGet to the point, Trite. If you have one.Phoenix:\nThat show is broadcast live at 1:30 PM. And it claims to be \"the most thrilling 10 minutes of your life\"...Judge:\nI-It's on the air at 1:30!?Phoenix:\nNow, supposedly, the victim made some noise when it was announced that he had won. And yet... I don't believe his cry of joy could have occurred after 2 PM! Because the show had already finished more than 30 minutes earlier by that point in time!Armstrong:\nNooooooooon!Phoenix:\nThis \"victim\" we've been told about has done nothing but the impossible! Listening to the radio with a ruptured eardrum, catching a show that was already over... There is only one conclusion you can draw from these facts! This \"victim\" was an imposter, acting out the poisoning 30 minutes after the real murder! Yes, there were two Glen Elgs in Tr\u00e9s Bien that day. The real Glen Elg, now dead, having been poisoned by the real killer... ...and the phony Glen Elg, acting out the events for Mr. Kudo to witness!Judge:\nI-It certainly seems that way... I mean, if that wasn't the case, how could you explain the time discrepancy?Godot:Godot:\nQuite a performance, Trite. You were almost on a roll.Phoenix:\n...!Godot:\nBut sadly, you lack the rock hard foundation of rhythm to build your song!Phoenix:\n(...What is this? Music Theory 101?)Godot:\nLet's recap. According to your \"imaginative\" theory, it's now just after 2 PM... The phony Elg is performing a play for the benefit of Mr. Kudo. How do you explain then, where the real Glen Elg is!?Phoenix:\nI don't believe I have to spell this out for court! However! At that time, the real Glen Elg was already dead!Judge:\nThat's certainly the obvious conclusion.Godot:Godot:\nThank you, Trite. That's exactly what I was hoping you would say.Phoenix:\nWh-What!?Godot:\nNow, I presume you can prove this theory of yours...? Can you explain where the missing corpse went to!?Phoenix:\nTh-The missing corpse...?Godot:\nAccording to the old man's testimony, there was only one other customer there. If that \"customer\" was the phony Glen Elg... ...then where did the killer hide the body of the real victim!?Phoenix:\nNaaaaaargh!Judge:\nThe prosecution has a valid point, Mr. Wright. If your theory is to stand up to examination by the court... ...you must provide us with proof by answering the prosecution's question. Where did the killer hide the body?Phoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor...Godot:\nNo conjecture, Trite. Let's hear some facts for once. Show the court a piece of evidence that proves where the body was hidden!Phoenix:\nE-Evidence!?Maya:\nWh-What's with the intense pressure in here all of a sudden!?Phoenix:\n(I thought I had him with that contradiction. But he's turned it all around and backed me into a corner instead!)Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? The court will now hear the defense's theory and evidence. First, where was the body of the real Mr. Elg concealed?Outside Tr\u00e9s Bien\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nClearly, there's no place to hide a body inside Tr\u00e9s Bien. Therefore, the killer must have hauled the body outside!\nJudge:\nHmm... I see.\nGodot:\nNice supposition. But the real question is, \"Can you back it up?\" Where's the evidence that proves the body was hidden in that location!?\n\n\n\nPresent anything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nGodot:\nToo bad... I don't think you'll ever grasp the real heart of Rock'n'Roll.\nPhoenix:\nWhat are you talking about?\nJudge:\nHe means that your evidence is irrelevant, Mr. Wright!\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! You've got to think it through! Feel the beat! And then hit him with some heavy metal!\nPhoenix:\n(OK, I need to calm down and get my facts straight. What should I do now?)\n\n\n\nStart over\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI-I think I need to clear my head...\nGodot:\nHa...! I'd say it's already empty, Trite!\nJudge:\nI'm inclined to agree.\nArmstrong:\nYo tambi\u00e9n.\nPhoenix:\n(What's with the Spanish all of a sudden!?)\nLeads back to:\n\"Well, Mr. Wright? The court will now hear the defense's theory and evidence.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent more evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(There's nothing wrong with my logic so far, I'm sure of it! I'll hit them with another piece of evidence and see if that helps...)\nLeads back to:\n\"Clearly, there's no place to hide a body inside Tr\u00e9s Bien.\"Inside Tr\u00e9s Bien\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt'd would [sic] have been too dangerous to take the body outside. Obviously, the body must have been hidden somewhere inside Tr\u00e9s Bien.\nJudge:\nHmm... Interesting... But where could a body have been hidden inside a restaurant? Perhaps you would care to show the court on these plans, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. The exact location where the body was concealed inside Tr\u00e9s Bien is...\n\n\n\nPresent anywhere\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe body was hidden here!\nJudge:\nHmm... I see.\nGodot:\nNice supposition. But the real question is, \"Can you back it up?\" Where's the evidence that proves the body was hidden in that location!?\n\n\n\nPresent Small Bottle (after presenting Kitchen)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Armstrong! Do you recognize this bottle?\"\n\n\n\n\nOtherwise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nGodot:\nToo bad... I don't think you'll ever grasp the real heart of Rock'n'Roll.\nPhoenix:\nWhat are you talking about?\nJudge:\nHe means that your evidence is irrelevant, Mr. Wright!\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! You've got to think it through! Feel the beat! And then hit him with some heavy metal!\nPhoenix:\n(OK, I need to calm down and get my facts straight.

I'd say it's already empty, Trite!\nJudge:\nI'm inclined to agree.\nArmstrong:\nYo tambi\u00e9n.\nPhoenix:\n(What's with the Spanish all of a sudden!?)\nLeads back to:\n\"Well, Mr. Wright? The court will now hear the defense's theory and evidence.\"\n\n\n\n\nPick another location\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(There's nothing wrong with my logic so far, I'm sure of it! I'll have another go at proving where the body was hidden.)\nLeads back to:\n\"It'd would have been too dangerous to take the body outside.\"Phoenix:\nMr. Armstrong! Do you recognize this bottle?Armstrong:\nNon! Non, non, non! I 'ave never seen z'at ugly bottle before in my life! I only use la very best bottles, monsieur! Z'e 'ighest quality only for me!Judge:\nWhere was that bottle found, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nInterestingly enough, Your Honor. it was found in the kitchen of Tr\u00e9s Bien.Armstrong:\nEh? Quoi!? But I only ever use z'ese bottles for my aromatherapy oils.Phoenix:\nBut this bottle doesn't contain aromatherapy oil, Mr. Armstrong. No, it contains a medication.Judge:\nWhat kind of medication?Phoenix:\nI'm sure everyone remembers, don't they? That Mr. Elg visited an otolaryngological clinic, and was given medication that day!Godot:\nY-You can't be serious...Phoenix:\nThe defense had the contents of the bottle analyzed, and I have the lab results here! The contents of the bottle match the prescription that was given to Mr. Elg!Godot:\nBwooooar!Phoenix:\nGlen Elg's murderer hid the body in the restaurant kitchen. At which time, this bottle fell out of the victim's pocket. Mr. Armstrong! When the incident occurred, didn't you say you were in the kitchen?Armstrong:\nM-M-Mon dieu!Phoenix:\nYes, you know about what I'm about to say, It was YOU who hid the victim's body! You did a fine job pretending to defend my client, Maggey Byrde. However! You were setting her up to take the fall behind the poor girl's back!Armstrong:\nNooooooooon!Judge:\nO-Order! Order! This is an extraordinary development. Witness! Did you... Did you murder Mr. Glen Elg?Armstrong:\nNever! I could not do such an 'orrible thing!Godot:\nNoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!Judge:\nM-Mr. Godot!?Godot:\n...The bitterness... Every time I get lied to, I always down a mug of coffee. ...That's one of my rules.Phoenix:\n(Do you have the slightest idea how many cups you've had by now...?)Godot:\nThen I like to do the same to the person who lied to me. I like to take them down with my empty cup! Listen up, chef! How about a brand new flavor in your ear, my \"h\" deficient friend?Armstrong:\nJe vous demande pardon! Please, you must 'ear me out! It is a trap! Listen to me! Por favor!Judge:\nYo hablo Espa\u00f1ol, Mr. Armstrong, and \"Por favor\" is Spanish.Godot:\nI'm only going to ask you once. Did you do it?Armstrong:\nNon! Non, non! Absolutely non! I simply... I...Godot:\nLet's hear it. You've got one shot. Right, gramps?Judge:\nWitness! The court will permit you the chance to make one final statement. If you lie under oath again, Mr. Godot's coffee mug awaits you... As does my gavel!Armstrong:\nO-Oui... It is clear.Phoenix:\n(What do they always say in the movies...? \"I've got a bad feeling about this...\"?)Judge:\nVery well! Begin your final testimony, Mr. Armstrong!Witness Testimony-- The Confession --Armstrong:\nIt is true, I 'id la body in la kitchen.\nA man forced me to do it.

By who!?Armstrong:\nI-I cannot say! Or I will be... erased!Phoenix:\nLet's try a different question then. When Mr. Elg died, was he really the only person at his table?Armstrong:\n... Z'ere was... Z'ere was another man.Phoenix:\n(I knew it!)Maya:\nMaggey was telling the truth!Judge:\nYou may cross-examine the witness now, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\n(There's just one more thing I need to do.

Maybe a month ago in this very courtroom?) This man is Furio Tigre. He's the manager of a loan office called \"Tender Lender\".\nArmstrong:\n...\nPhoenix:\nThere's no point trying to hide the truth anymore, Mr. Armstrong. I know you couldn't go against Mr. Tigre.

You must make clear the identity of the man who ordered you to do this.\nArmstrong:\n...Maya:\nHe's already confessed this much! He might as well stop dancing around the real issue!Phoenix:\nYeah. But he really doesn't want to tell us who the killer is.Maya:\nThen sock it to him, Nick!Phoenix:\n(Yeah, that's not a bad idea!)Phoenix:\nA half million dollar loan from a black-market loan shark.

After z'at, I just tried to forget what I 'ad seen!Phoenix:\nI think we can now safely say that the man who forced your hand was Mr. Furio Tigre.Judge:\nHmm... I do have one further question for you, Mr. Armstrong. The poison and the lottery ticket were recovered from the defendant's apron pocket. Was that your doing as well?Armstrong:\nNon! I knew nothing about z'at! Making it look like it was Maggey who 'ad done it... I was... I was not...

Not a minute more.Phoenix:\nH-How the...?Godot:\nDon't sit back and relax yet, Trite! No one knows if that chef is really telling the truth or not.

We've almost got this case won now, Nick.Phoenix:\nI wish I could agree.Maya:\nHuh?Phoenix:\nWhen I cross-examined Mr. Armstrong just now... ...he said he was just doing what The Tiger told him to do. But Godot picked up on it, remember? He pointed out that without proof, we don't know if what he testified is the truth.Maya:\nYou mean, you think Mr. Armstrong was lying?Phoenix:\nI don't know. But if that's the line the prosecution takes, we could be in trouble.

But it appears that Mr. Elg knew you.Tigre:\nWhat!?Phoenix:\nMr. Elg left this little note on his calendar. \"Meet with The Tiger\"... And the date? December 3rd.

Well, there's was [sic] a case once, where a young lad ate--\nPhoenix:\nA-Anyway! If you had never met the victim before, how do explain this note he left?Tigre:\nThere was some lame guy with that name, though. Wanted to borrow cash from me.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThat's very strange. According to the manager of the firm where the victim worked... ...December 3rd was the date he had to repay his loan. He wasn't due to discuss borrowing money, but repaying what he owed...\nTigre:\nOh. Yeah. Maybe youse right. Whatever it was, it was goin' down at the beginnin' of December.\nPhoenix:\nSo you did meet Mr. Elg, then!?\nTigre:\nHey, Wright. Youse might wanna cool your jets a sec.Tigre:\nI set up a meetin' with the guy... at my office, Tender Lender.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo your meeting wasn't supposed to be at Tr\u00e9s Bien, then?\nTigre:\nWhy would I wanna go to a dump like dat?

I got the best punching bag youse ever saw in there.\nPhoenix:\n(Not exactly a professional office you've got there, you know...) So you were in your office on the day in question?Tigre:\nI waited around for him, but he ain't ever showed.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe didn't show up?\nGodot:\nHa...!

We can chat about this thing my way, yeah? I got the best punching bag youse ever saw in there.\nPhoenix:\nNo, no! No need! I'm good, thanks!\nTigre:\nListen up!

Not even once?\nTigre:\nNot even once. I was in my office the day that went down. I didn't put poison in no kid's coffee. Capice?\nJudge:\nHmm...Present Tr\u00e9s Bien Matches\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Tigre. Is there something you'd like to tell the court about these matches?\"Maya:\nDo you think he really didn't meet Glen Elg?Phoenix:\nNot likely.

You didn't actually meet with him in the end, then. Well, Mr. Wright. Your cross-examination, please.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.Tigre:\nHold it! If I wait around here any longer, I ain't even gonna make the normal express. No more stupid questions.Godot:\nHa...! No problem. Any time Trite presses you on something irrelevant, I'll see he pays a penalty.Judge:\nM-Mr. Godot! That's my job!Godot:\nYour job is to slam that little hammer of yours and call a guilty verdict. So do it!Judge:\nY-Yes, sir!Tigre:\nThe special express ain't cheap, Wright! Just so youse know since youse payin'!Phoenix:\n(Oh, man.

Yesterday's session didn't go so well, and then ended on a giant mystery.Phoenix:\n(That's true... And we still haven't solved a single part of it yet...)Maya:\nAre you OK, Nick?Phoenix:\nHuh? Oh, uh... Yeah. Of course.Byrde:\nI saw that! That little flash of doubt in your eyes!Phoenix:\nN-No! That wasn't doubt. That was, umm... determination!Byrde:\nWhy don't I believe you...?Maya:\nIt's nearly time, Maggey. You'd better get going to the defendant's seat.Byrde:\nRoger. Don't let me down, Mr. Wright. I'm counting on you!Hey, pal!Phoenix:\nHey, Detective Gumshoe...Gumshoe:\nQuit stressing Maggey out! She doesn't need that!Phoenix:\nH-How did you know she was stressed...?Gumshoe:\nI was watching through the doorway.Phoenix:\nOh...Gumshoe:\nYou look like you lost the case already. Show a bit of confidence, will you, pal!? Here, maybe this'll help.Maya:\nHuh!? Have you taken up aromatherapy, too?Gumshoe:\nNot in a million years, pal! Don't tell me that you don't remember this thing?Phoenix:\n(Hmm... Come to think of it, that doesn't look like one of those aromatherapy bottles...)Gumshoe:\nThis is the small bottle that turned up in Tr\u00e9s Bien's kitchen a couple of days ago.Maya:\nWow! Look at all these little bottles!Phoenix:\nOh! They're aromatherapy oils! He's got so many, they're overflowing onto the floor...Maya:\nHey, wait a minute... There's one bottle that's different from all the others.Phoenix:\nWell what do you know. And it doesn't have a label either.Maya:\nAnd... *sniff* It doesn't smell.Gumshoe:\nWe finally got the analysis results back from the lab.Maya:\nSo!? What is it? Is it the poison?Gumshoe:\nI'm afraid not, pal. It's... medication.Maya:\nMedication?Gumshoe:\nYeah. For ears. Topical use only, apparently.Phoenix:\nFor ears? You mean...?Gumshoe:\nYeah. It's the medication Glen Elg was using for his ruptured eardrum!Phoenix:\n(What was Glen Elg's ear medicine doing in the kitchen...?)Small Bottle refiled into the Court Record.Phoenix:\nUm, what about the unidentified fingerprints? Anything on that?Gumshoe:\nSomeone screwed up, so they only had time to analyze the contents of the bottle. Another hour and they might have gotten something on the prints, but...Phoenix:\n(Hmm... That's going to weaken its impact as a piece of evidence...)Gumshoe:\nOK, pal! This is it! Make sure your defense is impregnable today, got it!?Phoenix:\n(Today's trial... I'm gonna expose that guy for what he's done, or my name isn't Phoenix Wright!)January 8, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Maggey Byrde.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Godot:\nReady and waiting as always, Your Honor.Judge:\nVery good. Then we'll get underway at once. Yesterday we heard the testimony of Mr. Victor Kudo. He claims to have witnessed the defendant putting a powder into the victim's coffee. However, the witness's testimony was plagued with a number of problems.Godot:\nThe mark on the rim of the cup shows that the victim drank from it with his right hand. But according to the old man's testimony, he picked it up with his left hand.Judge:\nThank you, Mr. Godot. Furthermore, according to the witness's account... ...the victim was listening to the radio with an earpiece in his left ear. Yet, the victim's left eardrum was ruptured, which made him effectively deaf in that ear.Maya:\nIt's amazing how many contradictions a single case can have, huh Nick?Godot:\nHa...! Allow me to enlighten you, Your Honor. The world, you see, keeps turning, and we must turn with it.Judge:\n... You've lost me already, Mr. Godot.Godot:\nDon't let the mysteries of yesterday mystify you today. Only losers think like that. You've got to change with the times! That's one of my rules!Judge:\nAre you implying that you've resolved these contradictions? You know the answers to these riddles!?Godot:\nThe old guy wasn't just throwing seed in here. He was throwing us off the scent. And today I'll prove it.Judge:\nVery well. Let the first witness take the stand!Godot:\nAnd you are?Armstrong:\nOh bonjour, everyone! I am Jean Armstrong. z'e owner and 'ead chef of la Tr\u00e9s Bien restaurant. Enchant\u00e9!.........Judge:\nForgive me for asking, witness, but... are you a woman?Armstrong:\nOh l\u00e0 l\u00e0, monsieur! As you can see, I am la pert and perky gentleman, non?Judge:\nEr... Umm...Godot:\nOn the day of the incident, you were in Tr\u00e9s Bien's kitchen. Isn't that right?Armstrong:\nW'iz you monsieur...Godot:\n...?Armstrong:\n...everything feels right!Godot:\nHa...!Phoenix:\n(Wow, he's totally unfazed! Doesn't anything intimidate this guy...?)Judge:\nVery well. Your testimony please, witness. Please tell the court what happened that day at Tr\u00e9s Bien.Armstrong:\nOui! Volontiers!Witness Testimony-- At Tr\u00e9s Bien --Armstrong:\nWhen it all 'appened, z'ere were just two customers in my restaurant.\nI remember I was experimenting w'iz some new art deco z'at day.\nLike 'aving a large mirror between la tables, for example.\nOui! Per'aps z'at is what la old man was looking at.\nLa cup, la earpiece, and la glasses... 'E would 'ave seen everyz'ing in reverse, non?Phoenix:\nA m...m...m... MIRROR!?Armstrong:\nOui! Un grand mirror! La most enormous mirror!Godot:\nAnd suddenly, the mystery disappears! Like I said, the world keeps turning, so roll with it!Judge:\nHmm... That would explain the coffee cup and the earpiece conundrum... The mirror would have made everything appear back to front.Phoenix:\n(What the heck!? It's way too early in the morning for this to be happening to me!)Judge:\nNow then, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- At Tr\u00e9s Bien --Armstrong:\nWhen it all 'appened, z'ere were just two customers in my restaurant.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd who were the two customers, exactly?\nArmstrong:\nMais, of course. La young man who died... ...and la other, not-so-young, man.\nJudge:\nHmm... You are referring to yesterday's witness, I presume?\nPhoenix:\n(What about the other man Maggey says she saw at the table? Something tells me Mr. Armstrong isn't planning to disclose his existence...)\nMaya:\nWe need some hard evidence first before we can bring him up, don't we...?\nPhoenix:\nI guess I'll just have to try a different approach for the time being.Armstrong:\nI remember I was experimenting w'iz some new art deco z'at day.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou were experimenting with art deco? How come I never heard about that before today?\nArmstrong:\nYou are not familiar w'iz z'e language of interior design, monsieur?\nPhoenix:\nPlease stay on topic! Now, why didn't you tell the court about this before!?\nArmstrong:\nBut I did. Just a few moments ago!\nJudge:\nAhem! Excuse me, Mr. Armstrong. This \"deco\" you mentioned... Are you referring to some sort of \"decocture\"?\nPhoenix:\nNo, no! Art deco, it is a style of design! ...Your Honor. He's talking about interior design. Walls, ceilings, carpets, that kind of thing.\nJudge:\nAh, yes. Of course. That \"deco\".\nArmstrong:\nI was trying to achieve a more \"la effeminate\" look for my restaurant. I was planning z'e most bold remodeling of la decor.Armstrong:\nLike 'aving a large mirror between la tables, for example.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow big of a mirror are we talking about here?\nArmstrong:\nBof! Something about 4 meters wide and, err... Oui. About 2 meters 'igh.\nPhoenix:\n(Let's see... If 1 meter is about 1 yard... Holy glass in a frame, that's huge!)\nArmstrong:\nI was intending to install it on la ceiling eventually.\nPhoenix:\nThe ceiling!? (Was there a mirror on the ceiling!? I don't remember...)\nArmstrong:\nMais, non. But I decided not to go through w'iz it in z'e end.\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I ask him more about the mirror or not?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(He couldn't lie about such a huge object like that. It must've been there in the restaurant somewhere.)\nGodot:\n...\nLeads to:\n\"Hmm... So the witness yesterday had seen the victim reflected in a mirror...\"\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIf you really had such a large mirror in the restaurant, someone would have noticed it! But there's nothing about a mirror in Mr. Kudo or Maggey Byrde's testimonies!\nArmstrong:\nB-But...\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nYou didn't ask, Trite. You have only yourself to blame for such sloppy work.\nPhoenix:\nWhat!?\nGodot:\nA mirror was delivered to Tr\u00e9s Bien the day before the incident.\nPhoenix:\nR-Really?\nGodot:\nAs Mr. Armstrong testified, he was carrying out some design changes. And as it turned out, he didn't actually use the mirror in the end.\nPhoenix:\n(This just doesn't add up. Even if a mirror was delivered to Tr\u00e9s Bien... ...it doesn't prove that it was in the restaurant on the day of the crime.)\nGodot:\nHa...! If you want to doubt someone, Trite, look in the mirror. I'm sure the person looking back at you will be dubious enough!\nLeads to:\n\"Hmm... So the witness yesterday had seen the victim reflected in a mirror...\"\n\n\nJudge:\nHmm... So the witness yesterday had seen the victim reflected in a mirror...Armstrong:\nOui! Per'aps z'at is what la old man was looking at.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nNormally, I'd expect people to know the difference between a reflection and a real object.\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\n\"Normally\"? How does normality come into this? That's lame, Trite. Even for you.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGodot:\nAre you trying to say that if something isn't normal, it isn't possible? Is that it? Where does that leave the porcu-headed lawyer and the topknot chick over there... and the ungodly cool guy with the mask over here? Well, Trite!?\nPhoenix:\nAaack! Not the hair!\nMaya:\nI do not have a topknot!\nJudge:\nMr. Godot is correct. A lack of normality is no basis for discounting an argument.\nArmstrong:\nBien! Logic 'as won la day!Armstrong:\nLa cup, la earpiece, and la glasses... 'E would 'ave seen everyz'ing in reverse, non?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nEverything? He would have seen everything in reverse?\nArmstrong:\nOui.\nMaya:\nHey, Nick... We should take a sec and think about what Old Seedy said in his testimony...\nPhoenix:\n(How did he phrase it again...?)\n\n\nKudo:\nThe boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs.\n\n\nKudo:\nNo question! You can lock me up if I'm wrong! It was his left ear, without a doubt!\n\n\nKudo:\nAnd then he used the same hand to pick up the cup. His left hand!\n\n\nMaya:\nIf he saw everything he described reflected in a mirror... ...then everything he said he saw on the \"left\" was actually on the \"right\", huh.\nPhoenix:\n(And that clears up all the problems with his testimony, I guess... Or does it...?)\nGodot:\nHa...!Present Glen Elg profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"The coffee cup, the earpiece, and the HMD...\"Phoenix:\n(It's kinda hard to believe everything's the fault of a mirror, but...)Maya:\nDo you think Old Seedy saw everything through a reflection...?Phoenix:\nIf he did, it would explain all the contradictions in his testimony.Maya:\nBut that just makes the situation worse for Maggey! There's gotta be something in that old man's testimony! We've just gotta dig deeper!Phoenix:\nThe coffee cup, the earpiece, and the HMD... Let's think back over Mr. Kudo's testimony for a second, shall we?Kudo:\nThe boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs.Kudo:\nNo question! You can lock me up if I'm wrong! It was his left ear, without a doubt!Phoenix:\nSo, to summarize... ...we were told both the HMD and the earpiece were on the victim's left side. Now, if Mr. Kudo saw all that as a reflection in a mirror... ...it means both the HMD and the earpiece were actually on the victim's right side.Armstrong:\nExactement! You see, monsieur. Now z'at you think about it, it is not so 'ard, non?Phoenix:\nUnfortunately, that's where we run into a monumental contradiction with the facts! If Mr. Kudo really did see everything in a mirror... ...why is it that the HMD is now on the wrong side of his head!?Judge:\nOrder! Order! ...Mr. Wright is correct! If the witness genuinely observed the victim reflected in a mirror... ...then we would expect the victim's eyepiece to have been over his right eye.Godot:Godot:\n...How bitter. Trite, you should have a taste of this bitterness. It'll calm you down in no time.Phoenix:\nA-Are we talking about your coffee... or something completely different...?Godot:\nYou don't understand the way the witness thinks.Judge:\nHow he thinks?Godot:\nYou remember this, I presume?Phoenix:\nThe \"I broke the vase... sorry\" apology lett-- I mean Mr. Kudo's sworn testimony?Godot:\nExactly. The old man has one very grievous habit... other than throwing seeds. The more of an impression something makes, the more muddled his mind makes it. And what's the most striking thing about Mr. Elg?Judge:\nClearly, it's the victim's eyepiece.Godot:\nAnd that's my point. The old man strikes again! Mr. Elg's HMD made a big impression on the old man. \"I saw the earpiece and those new-fangled spectacles he was wearing! Oh, yes! They were both on his left ear! Do you hear? His left ear!\" Ha...! Well, Trite?Phoenix:\nUrk... (That's the worst, but best impression of Kudo ever...)Maya:\nWow! I really thought he was Old Seedy for a minute there! Godot's good!Judge:\nEnough! I must agree that yesterday's witness was irresponsibly rash in much of his testimony.Maya:\nBad luck, Nick. Looks like the \"boil\" of a contradiction you found is just a \"rash\".Godot:\nA mirror can't be beaten by a handful of seeds, nor can it lie. So... What exactly was the old man looking at? Fill us in, Mr. Armstrong. Go on, tell the court. We're all ears.Armstrong:\nOui. I can explain. Please, if you will look at la plans of la restaurant.Witness Testimony-- The Mirror --Armstrong:\nAlors. Is everyone sitting comfortably?\nLa mirror, it was in z'e middle of la restaurant, dividing z'e two 'alves.\nZ'ere is only one seat from which you could 'ave seen an image of la victim.\nZ'at was la seat at z'e table next to la victim's. Z'at was where la old man was sitting.\nAfter la terrible incident occurred, I move la mirror so it was not in z'e way.\nBut naturally, I did not touch anything else!Judge:\nHmm... I see no problems with the explanation we have just heard. From the table next to the victim's, Mr. Kudo could have seen the victim in the mirror.Armstrong:\nWhat a naughty little coquette I am, confusing all z'e men like z'is!Godot:\nDon't worry about it. We can keep up, except for the guy breaking out in a cold sweat over there again.Phoenix:\n(Argh! I hate that guy!)Judge:\nYou said you didn't touch anything else apart from the mirror. Are you quite sure about that?Armstrong:\nVolontiers! Of course!Judge:\nVery well. Mr. Wright. Your cross-examination, if you please.Cross Examination-- The Mirror --Armstrong:\nLa mirror, it was in z'e middle of la restaurant, dividing z'e two 'alves.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, run this by me again. The mirror was here, correct?\nArmstrong:\nOui.\nPhoenix:\nOui? Really!? Because I know if I were you, I wouldn't have put a mirror there! It would be in the way!\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nLook who's talking, Trite.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGodot:\nYou're obstructing my view, among other things.\nPhoenix:\nBut, but, but! This is my seat in the courtroom...!\nGodot:\nTr\u00e9s Bien's \"charm\" is that it gives you the impression that you're the only customer. Temporarily placing a mirror in that spot would hardly be \"in the way\". Unlike you... Trite.\nArmstrong:\nI tell you, monsieur. la mirror was z'ere, in z'e middle of la restaurant.Armstrong:\nZ'ere is only one seat from which you could 'ave seen an image of la victim.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd where would that be!?\nArmstrong:\nOh l\u00e1 l\u00e1! Look 'ow you lean towards me! I always attract z'e younger boys! Maybe I should keep you in suspense a little longer!\nJudge:\nMr. Armstrong! Tell the court what you know at once!\nArmstrong:\nI attract z'e older ones, too, you know, 'andsome! Shall I tease you, too!?\nJudge:\nNnngh...\nGodot:\nI'm already seeing a very hot someone, so I'm afraid you'll be waiting for a long time.\nMaya:\nI bet she has mocha-cream skin and cappuccino perfume.\nArmstrong:\nBien. I will tell you... Z'ere was only one seat from which you could 'ave seen...Armstrong:\nZ'at was la seat at z'e table next to la victim's. Z'at was where la old man was sitting.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo why can you only see the victim from that particular seat?\nArmstrong:\nMais, monsieur. It is obvious, non? If you look at la plans you will understand. La victim would 'ave been reflected in la mirror like so. If you were sitting at la table next to 'im, you would see everything, non?\nMaya:\nSo that's the seat Old Seedy was sitting in on that day... ...when the poisoning happened.\nPhoenix:\n(The old man was sitting at the table next to the victim? Why does that seem kinda odd...?)Present Victor's Testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! Mr. Kudo's words yesterday strongly contradict Mr. Armstrong's testimony!\nJudge:\nThis is... the letter of apology that was written by Mr. Kudo, is it not?\nPhoenix:\nI realize it looks useless, Your Honor, but this is still testimony.\nGodot:\nHa...! I guess useless people are only really good at identifying useless things.\nJudge:\nWhat relevance does this scrap of paper have to the trial, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nMr. Kudo's testimony is actually very relevant to the question at hand, Your Honor! Because it very clearly contradicts with this piece of evidence!\n\n\n\nPresent Crime Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThis piece of evidence contradicts with testimony we have heard, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nThe crime photo...?\nPhoenix:\nYes. This photo clearly shows something that theoretically should not exist!\nJudge:\nWhat on Earth do you mean by that, Mr. Wright!?\nGodot:\n\"Should not exist\"? Ha... Sounds like you're describing yourself, Trite.\nJudge:\nNow then, if the defense would please clarify its statement. What is the something that \"should not exist\" in this photo?\n\n\n\nPresent vase on left table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"There is one thing that was clearly demonstrated by yesterday's testimony.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThis is what should not be in the picture!\nJudge:\nI'm sorry? I'm afraid you've lost me.\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nGodot:\nHa...! I suppose it's up to me to clarify the defense's claim. The something that \"shouldn't exist\" is clearly...\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait, wait, wait! I've change my mind, Your Honor! (The last thing I need right now is a scalding hot coffee shower...)\nJudge:\nVery well. Gather your thoughts, Mr. Wright. In the meantime, the witness will repeat his testimony for the court.\nArmstrong:\nOui. I would be delighted!\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nWell... ...I'm not sure the contradiction... ...is as clear as you would have us believe, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n...Oh.\nJudge:\nPerhaps you should reconsider before you try again, hm?\nPhoenix:\nTry again...? (You mean I was wrong?)\nJudge:\nVery well. Gather your thoughts, Mr. Wright. In the meantime, the witness will repeat his testimony for the court.\nArmstrong:\nOui. I would be delighted!\nLeads back to cross-examinationPresent Crime Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThis piece of evidence contradicts with testimony we have heard, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nThe crime photo...?\nPhoenix:\nYes.

Sounds like you're describing yourself, Trite.\nJudge:\nNow then, if the defense would please clarify its statement. What is the something that \"should not exist\" in this photo?\n\n\n\nPresent vase on left table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nI think it's pretty obvious that this is what should not be in the picture!\nJudge:\nThe vase!? What possible connection does that have with this witness's testimony?\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor... I'm telling you that there should have been no vase on this table. Because it very clearly contradicts with this piece of evidence!\n\n\n\nPresent Victor's Testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"There is one thing that was clearly demonstrated by yesterday's testimony.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nWell... ...I'm not sure the contradiction... ...is as clear as you would have us believe, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n...Oh.\nJudge:\nPerhaps you should reconsider before you try again, hm?\nPhoenix:\nTry again...? (You mean I was wrong?)\nJudge:\nVery well. Gather your thoughts, Mr. Wright. In the meantime, the witness will repeat his testimony for the court.\nArmstrong:\nOui.

In the meantime, the witness will repeat his testimony for the court.\nArmstrong:\nOui. I would be delighted!\nLeads back to cross-examinationArmstrong:\nAfter la terrible incident occurred, I move la mirror so it was not in z'e way.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid you move the mirror while Mr. Kudo was off calling the police?\nArmstrong:\nOui. Exactement. I carried it out of la restaurant z'en.\nPhoenix:\nYou moved a huge mirror like that all by yourself?\nArmstrong:\nWhat can I say? I know 'ow to pick things up, 'andsome!\nPhoenix:\n...\nGodot:\nHeh heh...\nMaya:\nG-Godot actually laughed at something!\nJudge:\nWell, given the witness's physique, I suppose it is possible. Did you move anything else from the crime scene, Mr. Armstrong?\nArmstrong:\nI look like z'e obliging type, non?Armstrong:\nBut naturally, I did not touch anything else!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure about that?\nArmstrong:\nI touched nothing except la mirror!\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\nMr. Wright? Is there something the witness has said that doesn't match the crime scene?\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, there is... I just can't put my finger on what exactly.)\nGodot:\nHa...! Suffering from a case of heartburn, Trite?\nArmstrong:\nOh, I 'ave just z'e thing for z'at! An oil with golden myrrh and frankenstaince...\nGodot:\nAdd a few drops to your coffee, and voila! Enjoy.\nPhoenix:\n(Focus, Phoenix. Breathe... I need to ignore those two and just find some evidence.)Present Victor's Testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! Mr. Kudo's words yesterday strongly contradict Mr. Armstrong's testimony!\nJudge:\nThis is... the letter of apology that was written by Mr. Kudo, is it not?\nPhoenix:\nI realize it looks useless, Your Honor, but this is still testimony.\nGodot:\nHa...! I guess useless people are only really good at identifying useless things.\nJudge:\nWhat relevance does this scrap of paper have to the trial, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nMr. Kudo's testimony is actually very relevant to the question at hand, Your Honor! Because it very clearly contradicts with this piece of evidence!\n\n\n\nPresent Crime Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThis piece of evidence contradicts with testimony we have heard, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nThe crime photo...?\nPhoenix:\nYes. This photo clearly shows something that theoretically should not exist!\nJudge:\nWhat on Earth do you mean by that, Mr. Wright!?\nGodot:\n\"Should not exist\"? Ha... Sounds like you're describing yourself, Trite.\nJudge:\nNow then, if the defense would please clarify its statement. What is the something that \"should not exist\" in this photo?\n\n\n\nPresent vase on left table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"There is one thing that was clearly demonstrated by yesterday's testimony.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anywhere else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThis is what should not be in the picture!\nJudge:\nI'm sorry? I'm afraid you've lost me.\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nGodot:\nHa...! I suppose it's up to me to clarify the defense's claim. The something that \"shouldn't exist\" is clearly...\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nW-Wait, wait, wait! I've change my mind, Your Honor! (The last thing I need right now is a scalding hot coffee shower...)\nJudge:\nVery well. Gather your thoughts, Mr. Wright. In the meantime, the witness will repeat his testimony for the court.\nArmstrong:\nOui. I would be delighted!\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nWell... ...I'm not sure the contradiction... ...is as clear as you would have us believe, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n...Oh.\nJudge:\nPerhaps you should reconsider before you try again, hm?\nPhoenix:\nTry again...? (You mean I was wrong?)\nJudge:\nVery well. Gather your thoughts, Mr. Wright. In the meantime, the witness will repeat his testimony for the court.\nArmstrong:\nOui. I would be delighted!\nLeads back to cross-examinationPresent Crime Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThis piece of evidence contradicts with testimony we have heard, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nThe crime photo...?\nPhoenix:\nYes.

What is the something that \"should not exist\" in this photo?\n\n\n\nPresent vase on left table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nI think it's pretty obvious that this is what should not be in the picture!\nJudge:\nThe vase!? What possible connection does that have with this witness's testimony?\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor... I'm telling you that there should have been no vase on this table. Because it very clearly contradicts with this piece of evidence!\n\n\n\nPresent Victor's Testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"There is one thing that was clearly demonstrated by yesterday's testimony.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nWell... ...I'm not sure the contradiction... ...is as clear as you would have us believe, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n...Oh.\nJudge:\nPerhaps you should reconsider before you try again, hm?\nPhoenix:\nTry again...?

In the meantime, the witness will repeat his testimony for the court.\nArmstrong:\nOui. I would be delighted!\nLeads back to cross-examinationMaya:\nIt is pretty strange, though, isn't it? I mean, nobody mentioned anything about a really large mirror. You'd think someone would've, but Maggey didn't, and neither did Old Seedy.Phoenix:\nThen the only logical explanation is... ...that there was no mirror inside Tr\u00e9s Bien that day. (Now I've just got to prove it... Somehow...)Phoenix:\nThere is one thing that was clearly demonstrated by yesterday's testimony. Mr. Kudo broke the vase that was on the table where he was sitting. And yet! As the court can see, there is an unbroken vase on the table next to the victim! Why? Because Mr. Kudo was not, in fact, sitting at the table next to the victim at all!Godot:Godot:\nDon't be an idiot, Trite! That's impossible! That seat's the only one Kudo could've seen the victim's reflection from!Phoenix:\nExactly!Godot:\n...!Phoenix:\nThere is only one conclusion we can draw from this contradiction. There was no mirror in Tr\u00e9s Bien that day! Your testimony, Mr. Armstrong, is an elaborate lie!Armstrong:\nMon dieeeeeeeu!Godot:Godot:\nDon't try to confuse the court, Trite! Obviously, the witness cleaned up the vase... ...while the police were taking their time getting to the crime scene!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nUnfortunately, Mr. Godot, that doesn't quite work for me. Mr. Armstrong already testified to the contrary. In his own words... \"I did not touch anything else\" except the mirror!Godot:\nUr... urgh! ... Gaaaaaaaaargh!Judge:\nWell, witness? What do you have to say for yourself?Armstrong:\n*sniffle*Phoenix:\n(I was right! There was no mirror in the restaurant that day!)Judge:\nIn light of this revelation, we return back to the original problem. Why did the victim have an earpiece in an ear in which he couldn't hear?Godot:\nHa...! You only get one shot in life. There's no turning back. If you want to claim that the mirror wasn't there, Trite... ...then this problem is all yours. How do you explain what the old man saw?Phoenix:\n(If I can answer this, then I'll be that much closer to the truth! I can feel it!)Maya:\n...Are you going to be OK? Can you really solve this contradiction, Nick?Phoenix:\nThere's more than just this one contradiction, Maya.Maya:\nWhat do you mean?Phoenix:\nRemember what Maggey told us? \"There was another man at the victim's table.\" And, \"there was a sample CD on the victim's table.\" It all flies in the face of Mr. Kudo's testimony. (And I think I know the reason why nothing in this case is adding up.)Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Let's hear your answer.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. The reason behind all the contradictions in Mr. Kudo's testimony is simple.Mr. Kudo made a mistake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nClearly, Mr. Kudo made a mistake!\nGodot:\nMr. Trite... You're the one who brought up all these contradictions.\nPhoenix:\nAnd...?\nGodot:\nIf you're trying to tell us the old man just made a mistake... ...we can wrap up this case right now with a guilty verdict!\nJudge:\nHow about it, Mr. Wright? Should I just declare your client guilty?\nMaya:\nIs that the best you can come up with, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm sorry, Your Honor. I was the one who made a mistake.\nJudge:\nI'll give you one more chance, Mr. Wright. Think carefully before you answer this time!\nLeads back to:\n\"Yes, Your Honor.\"The ear doctor made a mistake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI believe we're looking at this the wrong way. It was actually the doctor's mistake.\nJudge:\nWhat?\nPhoenix:\nYes. The doctor got the wrong ear!\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nWell, I believe we saw an autopsy report yesterday. One that stated the victim's left eardrum was ruptured, and had medicine in it!\nJudge:\nI'm beginning to wonder if it's not your eardrum that's ruptured, Mr. Wright.\nMaya:\nThis is no time to be playing with people's perceptions, Nick!\nPhoenix:\nI-I'm sorry, Your Honor. I was the one who made a mistake.\nJudge:\nI'll give you one more chance, Mr. Wright. Think carefully before you answer this time!\nLeads back to:\n\"Yes, Your Honor.\"The victim was a phony.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"This case is riddled with contradictions.\"Phoenix:\nThis case is riddled with contradictions. Yet, there is one very simple answer that clears them all up.Judge:\nA-And what is that?Phoenix:\nThe incident Mr. Kudo witnessed, and the incident the victim experienced... ...were two completely different events!Godot:\nWhat!?Phoenix:\nYes! The \"victim\" that Mr. Kudo saw wasn't Mr. Glen Elg at all! It was an imposter -- a phony pretending to be Mr. Elg! Obviously, unlike the victim, there was nothing wrong with the imposter's left eardrum. That's how he ended up wearing the earpiece in his left ear by mistake!Godot:\nPhwoooooooh!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Settle down, or I'll clear the courtroom!Godot:\nQuiet, gramps! Why don't you clear out of here, huh?Judge:\nWHAT DID YOU SAY!?Godot:\nTrite... Are you saying what Mr. Kudo saw was a set-up?Phoenix:\nYes. Someone pretended to be Glen Elg and acted out the whole coffee poisoning. All for the express purpose of creating a \"witness\" out of one Mr. Victor Kudo!Godot:Godot:\nGet real, Trite! Why would anyone want to do that?Phoenix:\nIsn't it obvious? The thing Mr. Kudo was most insistent about in his testimony was...Kudo:\nThe serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it! That's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well!Judge:\nI-It's so hard to believe, but...Phoenix:\nThere was one, and only one reason to show Mr. Kudo this fake poisoning! To show Maggey Byrde in the act of poisoning the coffee!Godot:Godot:\nAre you insinuating that the waitress in the old man's story was a fake as well? It's true that there were no customers in the restaurant at the time, but... ...it's also true that the chef was there! He would have noticed what was happening.Judge:\nTh-That's right! Well, witness? If your restaurant really was the scene of such theatrics... ...you would have known about it, correct!?Armstrong:\nOh l\u00e0 l\u00e0... Z'is is most difficult for me...Phoenix:Phoenix:\nNo, it's quite simple. All you have to do is testify. You are under oath, after all. Was there, in fact, a phony at Tr\u00e9s Bien that day!? The defense demands that Mr. Armstrong tell the whole truth about what happened.Judge:\nThe defense's request for additional testimony is accepted. You will accurately explain, in detail, the events in the restaurant that day!Armstrong:\nOu... Oui.Witness Testimony-- In the Restaurant --Armstrong:\nLa victim, Monsieur Elg, 'e came to my restaurant alone.\nI remember la old man arrived not long after 'im.\nZ'ere were no other customers.\nWhen 'e got word 'e won la lottery, Mon. Elg became very excited.\nIt was approximately 5 minutes later z'at la poisoning incident occurred.\nNon, z'ere was no time for a phony to do la acting.Judge:\n...Just so we're clear, there was no mirror in the restaurant, after all?Armstrong:\nJe vous demande pardon! Forgive me, Your Honor! I lied because I wanted z'is mess to be cleared up quickly.Judge:\nWhat you have just done is commit perjury, Mr. Armstrong! I will decide how to punish you later.Armstrong:\nO-Oui...Judge:\nFor now, we will hear your cross-examination. Mr. Wright, if you please. (Changed from [For now, we will hear your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.] in the original release)Phoenix:\n(Hmm.. He took that perjury charge a bit too well. But I'm guessing he'll be more serious trouble after this cross-examination!)Cross Examination-- In the Restaurant --Armstrong:\nLa victim, Monsieur Elg, 'e came to my restaurant alone.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWas he alone at his table as well?\nArmstrong:\nMais, oui. I saw 'im from la kitchen.\nPhoenix:\nYet the defendant, Ms. Byrde, remembers it differently. She swears there was another man at the victim's table.\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHa...! Unfortunately for you, Trite... ...yesterday's witness also testified that the victim was alone.\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nYou know, seeing you squirm like that reminds me... ...of a certain coffee's bitter-sweet bite.\nPhoenix:\n(What kind of coffee has he been drinking!?)\nMaya:\nIt's not coffee, it's love! It's love that's bitter-sweet.\nPhoenix:\n(Hearing Maya say that makes her seem wise all of a sudden...)Armstrong:\nI remember la old man arrived not long after 'im.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBy old man, you mean Victor Kudo, correct?\nArmstrong:\nOui. 'E comes often for my special coffee.\nGodot:\nI drank your coffee once, Mr. Armstrong. It's special, I'll give you that. It's worth a sip just for the experience.\nArmstrong:\nOh, you make me so 'appy, monsieur! You are most welcome any time!\nGodot:\nI said it was worth one sip, and nothing more.\nPhoenix:\n(So old Mr. Kudo arrived at the restaurant around the same time as the victim. Maybe I should ask about his arrival in more detail.)\n\n\n\nDon't ask anything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(All I need to do is establish that this phony victim really existed. Asking more about the old man is only going to cloud the issue.) I think that's enough about coffee. Please continue with your testimony, Mr. Armstrong.\nArmstrong:\nYou are welcome any time too, Monsieur Wright. I'll brew something special for you!\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nHow many minutes after?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you're saying that not much time elapsed between when the victim and Mr. Kudo arrived?\nArmstrong:\nOui. Z'at is correct.\nPhoenix:\n(But that still leaves the possibility that something happened in that gap of time.) And by your recollection, how much time would you say elapsed?\nArmstrong:\nLet me see... Approximately 2 minutes, I would say.\nPhoenix:\nT-Two minutes!? That's all?\nJudge:\nHmm... It seems unlikely that anything untoward could have happened in such a short time.\nPhoenix:\n(Rats! I knew I shouldn't have pursued this line of questioning...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nWhat time is it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOut of curiosity, about what time was it when Mr. Kudo arrived?\nArmstrong:\nOh, no... I cannot remember, monsieur.\nJudge:\nHmm... I believe we were told by a witness yesterday...\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThe crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.\n\n\nJudge:\nDoes that perhaps jog your memory, witness?\nArmstrong:\nLa incident 'appened about 20 minutes after 'e arrived. So the victim must 'ave arrived between 2:00 PM and 2:10 PM, non?\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... Just after 2, huh...)\nArmstrong:\nThank you for your 'elp, in jogging my memory, monsieur. You are wonderful!\nJudge:\nHah hah hah! I can't sit here all the time and do nothing now, can I!? The time of day will be added to the witness's testimony.\nArmstrong:\nOui, Monsieur Judge. Everything I do, I do it for you!\nJudge:\nMerci bien. That's French, isn't it? Hah hah hah!\nPhoenix:\n(I'm glad at least one person is in a good mood...)\nMaya:\nH-He's even humming a song to himself...!\nChanges statement from \"I remember la old man arrived not long after 'im.\" to \"I remember la old man arrived not long after 'im, just after 2 PM.\"Armstrong:\nI remember la old man arrived not long after 'im, just after 2 PM.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely sure about the time?\nArmstrong:\nWhen I think really 'ard, 1 am sure it was just after 2. Oui. It is la time I stop serving la lunch menu.\nJudge:\nQuite right. I always break for lunch when the restaurants are serving their specials. I've been known to wind up a case early just to make it on time! Hah hah!\nPhoenix:\n(I guess you should never get between a hungry judge and his lunch...)\nJudge:\nOh, would you look at that! It's almost lunchtime already.\nPhoenix:\nWitness! Get on with your testimony, please!Present Millionaire Radio Flyer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I'm afraid I've finally got you, Mr. Armstrong.\"Armstrong:\nZ'ere were no other customers.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo your only customers were Mr. Kudo and the victim?\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHow many times do you need to ask the same thing, Trite? You'd never catch me drinking the same blend twice!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGodot:\nYou're trying to establish the presence of a \"phony victim\" in the restaurant. But you're wasting your time. You can't grind bird seed to make coffee, if you catch my drift...\nPhoenix:\n(But there's a hole in this testimony somewhere! I'm sure of it!)Armstrong:\nWhen 'e got word 'e won la lottery, Mon. Elg became very excited.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid you see him?\nArmstrong:\nNon, I was in ze kitchen. But I 'eard 'im. I remember 'im shouting, \"Yes! 'Alf a million bucks!\"\nGodot:\nPresumably the defendant heard that too, then, correct?\nArmstrong:\nMaggey...? She looked like a poor little frightened dove!\nPhoenix:\nAnd what about Mr. Kudo?\nArmstrong:\nLa old man chocked on some bird seed z'at got stuck in 'is throat.\nJudge:\nHmm... It seems we now have yet another incident on our hands.Armstrong:\nIt was approximately 5 minutes later z'at la poisoning incident occurred.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd what were you doing at that point? Without any customers, you must have had time to kill.\nArmstrong:\nI am multi-talented woman, monsieur!\nPhoenix:\nSorry? What do you mean?\nArmstrong:\nZ'ere is la renowned chef, Jean Armstrong, and la tragic poet, Claurice Armstrong.\nJudge:\nC-C-Claurice...?\nArmstrong:\nOui. I was writing a poem. An angry tale of a chef in 'alf a million dollars of debt... ...cooking for a man who won 'alf a million dollars on la lottery! It is called, \"Pourquoi\". It means, \"Why\". Per'aps I could recite it for la court?\nPhoenix:\nPlease don't...Present Millionaire Radio Flyer (after changing second statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I'm afraid I've finally got you, Mr. Armstrong.\"Armstrong:\nNon, z'ere was no time for a phony to do la acting.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou mean you contacted the police as soon as the incident occurred?\nArmstrong:\nI asked la old man to call from la pay phone.\nGodot:\nBy your own argument, Trite... ...the purpose of this \"phony victim's\" performance was so the old man would see it. In other words... ...once the incident occurred, this opportunity would completely disappear.\nJudge:\nIndeed.\nArmstrong:\nBien. It seems la shadow of doubt 'as been lifted, n'est-ce pas?\nPhoenix:\n...Present Millionaire Radio Flyer (after changing second statement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I'm afraid I've finally got you, Mr. Armstrong.\"Maya:\nI guess Mr. Armstrong is connected to this case, huh?Phoenix:\nAbsolutely. Someone was impersonating Mr. Elg, and I refuse to believe he was oblivious. He was there the whole time, after all.Maya:\nBut if you're right, wouldn't Maggey have noticed, too?Phoenix:\nShe fell unconscious when the incident occurred, remember?Maya:\nAh! You mean that's when the phony staged his act?Phoenix:\nWe'll know for sure once I find a hole in this testimony.Phoenix:\nI'm afraid I've finally got you, Mr. Armstrong.Armstrong:\nQ-Quoi? What do you mean?Phoenix:\nAt the time in question, the victim was listening to the radio with his earpiece. The show he was listening to was \"Millionaire Radio\". Each week, they announce the winning number of a half million dollar lottery ticket.Armstrong:\nOui. Z'at must be la show Mon. Elg was listening to.Judge:\nI can't see any problem with this testimony, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nI wonder...Armstrong:\n...?Phoenix:\nYou say the victim arrived at your restaurant after 2 PM, correct?Armstrong:\nOui, oui. I am sure of it. I remember it perfectly now! I know it was z'at time, because I 'ad just finished serving la lunch menu.Godot:\nGet to the point, Trite. If you have one.Phoenix:\nThat show is broadcast live at 1:30 PM. And it claims to be \"the most thrilling 10 minutes of your life\"...Judge:\nI-It's on the air at 1:30!?Phoenix:\nNow, supposedly, the victim made some noise when it was announced that he had won. And yet... I don't believe his cry of joy could have occurred after 2 PM! Because the show had already finished more than 30 minutes earlier by that point in time!Armstrong:\nNooooooooon!Phoenix:\nThis \"victim\" we've been told about has done nothing but the impossible! Listening to the radio with a ruptured eardrum, catching a show that was already over... There is only one conclusion you can draw from these facts! This \"victim\" was an imposter, acting out the poisoning 30 minutes after the real murder! Yes, there were two Glen Elgs in Tr\u00e9s Bien that day. The real Glen Elg, now dead, having been poisoned by the real killer... ...and the phony Glen Elg, acting out the events for Mr. Kudo to witness!Judge:\nI-It certainly seems that way... I mean, if that wasn't the case, how could you explain the time discrepancy?Godot:Godot:\nQuite a performance, Trite. You were almost on a roll.Phoenix:\n...!Godot:\nBut sadly, you lack the rock hard foundation of rhythm to build your song!Phoenix:\n(...What is this? Music Theory 101?)Godot:\nLet's recap. According to your \"imaginative\" theory, it's now just after 2 PM... The phony Elg is performing a play for the benefit of Mr. Kudo. How do you explain then, where the real Glen Elg is!?Phoenix:\nI don't believe I have to spell this out for court! However! At that time, the real Glen Elg was already dead!Judge:\nThat's certainly the obvious conclusion.Godot:Godot:\nThank you, Trite. That's exactly what I was hoping you would say.Phoenix:\nWh-What!?Godot:\nNow, I presume you can prove this theory of yours...? Can you explain where the missing corpse went to!?Phoenix:\nTh-The missing corpse...?Godot:\nAccording to the old man's testimony, there was only one other customer there. If that \"customer\" was the phony Glen Elg... ...then where did the killer hide the body of the real victim!?Phoenix:\nNaaaaaargh!Judge:\nThe prosecution has a valid point, Mr. Wright. If your theory is to stand up to examination by the court... ...you must provide us with proof by answering the prosecution's question. Where did the killer hide the body?Phoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor...Godot:\nNo conjecture, Trite. Let's hear some facts for once. Show the court a piece of evidence that proves where the body was hidden!Phoenix:\nE-Evidence!?Maya:\nWh-What's with the intense pressure in here all of a sudden!?Phoenix:\n(I thought I had him with that contradiction. But he's turned it all around and backed me into a corner instead!)Judge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? The court will now hear the defense's theory and evidence. First, where was the body of the real Mr. Elg concealed?Outside Tr\u00e9s Bien\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nClearly, there's no place to hide a body inside Tr\u00e9s Bien. Therefore, the killer must have hauled the body outside!\nJudge:\nHmm... I see.\nGodot:\nNice supposition. But the real question is, \"Can you back it up?\" Where's the evidence that proves the body was hidden in that location!?\n\n\n\nPresent anything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nGodot:\nToo bad... I don't think you'll ever grasp the real heart of Rock'n'Roll.\nPhoenix:\nWhat are you talking about?\nJudge:\nHe means that your evidence is irrelevant, Mr. Wright!\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! You've got to think it through! Feel the beat! And then hit him with some heavy metal!\nPhoenix:\n(OK, I need to calm down and get my facts straight. What should I do now?)\n\n\n\nStart over\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI-I think I need to clear my head...\nGodot:\nHa...! I'd say it's already empty, Trite!\nJudge:\nI'm inclined to agree.\nArmstrong:\nYo tambi\u00e9n.\nPhoenix:\n(What's with the Spanish all of a sudden!?)\nLeads back to:\n\"Well, Mr. Wright? The court will now hear the defense's theory and evidence.\"\n\n\n\n\nPresent more evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(There's nothing wrong with my logic so far, I'm sure of it! I'll hit them with another piece of evidence and see if that helps...)\nLeads back to:\n\"Clearly, there's no place to hide a body inside Tr\u00e9s Bien.\"Inside Tr\u00e9s Bien\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt'd would [sic] have been too dangerous to take the body outside. Obviously, the body must have been hidden somewhere inside Tr\u00e9s Bien.\nJudge:\nHmm... Interesting... But where could a body have been hidden inside a restaurant? Perhaps you would care to show the court on these plans, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. The exact location where the body was concealed inside Tr\u00e9s Bien is...\n\n\n\nPresent anywhere\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe body was hidden here!\nJudge:\nHmm... I see.\nGodot:\nNice supposition. But the real question is, \"Can you back it up?\" Where's the evidence that proves the body was hidden in that location!?\n\n\n\nPresent Small Bottle (after presenting Kitchen)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Armstrong! Do you recognize this bottle?\"\n\n\n\n\nOtherwise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nGodot:\nToo bad... I don't think you'll ever grasp the real heart of Rock'n'Roll.\nPhoenix:\nWhat are you talking about?\nJudge:\nHe means that your evidence is irrelevant, Mr. Wright!\nMaya:\nCome on, Nick! You've got to think it through! Feel the beat! And then hit him with some heavy metal!\nPhoenix:\n(OK, I need to calm down and get my facts straight.

I'd say it's already empty, Trite!\nJudge:\nI'm inclined to agree.\nArmstrong:\nYo tambi\u00e9n.\nPhoenix:\n(What's with the Spanish all of a sudden!?)\nLeads back to:\n\"Well, Mr. Wright? The court will now hear the defense's theory and evidence.\"\n\n\n\n\nPick another location\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(There's nothing wrong with my logic so far, I'm sure of it!

You' don't wanna cross them, or youse gonna wind up sleepin' with de fishes. Once the Godfather finds out youse been draggin' Violetta through the mud... ...he'll... do you... in...\nPhoenix:\n... Sorry, I... I couldn't quite put it all together towards the end there...\nMaya:\nHe said that just like Viola, didn't he?\nPhoenix:\n(I get the feeling this might not be the right time to probe him about her...)\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. Tigre!\nTigre:\nWhad'youse want!?\nPhoenix:\nErr... If you wouldn't mind going into a bit more detail...\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nThis is a dead end, Trite, and you know it. Remember the rules!\nJudge:\nPressing the witness without evidence to back up your attack is prohibited. As I said earlier, the court will impose a penalty for such behavior!\nPhoenix:\n(Ouch. The pain...)\nLeads to:\n\"Now then, Mr. Tigre...\"\n\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(It's too dangerous to press things without knowing where they might end up.

If I miss that bus, someone's gonna pay!\nPhoenix:\nNngh...Maya:\nJust think! All you have to do is press him on something irrelevant, and bam! $50,000!Phoenix:\nGet real, Maya! How about you pay back the money then. Your allowance should cover it!Maya:\nHey! I'm no idiot, you know!Phoenix:\n(Well, I'M certainly not the one who thought the $50,000 was free money!) Anyway, I need to work this guy without pressing his testimony too hard.Maya:\nBut his testimony is pretty solid as it is...Phoenix:\n(I admit nothing jumps out at me as a contradiction. But I've got to find an opening somewhere... Or I need to make one.)Phoenix:\nMr. Tigre... You claim you didn't know Mr. Glen Elg. But it appears that Mr. Elg knew you.Tigre:\nWhat!?Phoenix:\nMr. Elg left this little note on his calendar. \"Meet with The Tiger\"... And the date? December 3rd. (Changed from ['Meet with The Tiger'... Dated, December 3rd.] in the original release)Judge:\nD-December 3rd!? That's... the day of the murder!Phoenix:\nSo, Mr. Tigre, I submit that you did indeed know one Mr. Glen Elg! Because on the very day of the incident, you met with him!Tigre:\n... Grrrah ha ha ha hah! Not bad! Youse actually not bad.Phoenix:\nS-Sorry?Tigre:\nI was just messin' with youse to see how good you' were.Maya:\nDid you hear that, Nick? He said you're not bad!Phoenix:\n(That's one compliment I can do without! Plus, he's lying through his teeth!)Judge:\nUm, witness. Please remember that you're under oath. Lies will not be tolerated.Tigre:\nYouse callin' me a liar!? Is that what you' doin'!?Judge:\nRuh-roh!Godot:\nSo you're saying that your claim to have \"never seen that kid before\" is the truth?Tigre:\nI said I'm dead serious! Youse betta believe that's the truth!Godot:\nHa...! Then I'd say that gives me time... to enjoy another cup of pure black magic! That is, while you testify for the court again, Mr. Tigre.Judge:\nOh, yes! Um, would you mind indulging the court, witness?Phoenix:\n(He never actually met the victim!? That's got to be a lie right there! It's time I nailed this guy!)Witness Testimony-- The Victim, Glen Elg --Tigre:\nI ain't no liar. I never met Glen Elg.\nThere was some lame guy with that name, though. Wanted to borrow cash from me.\nI set up a meetin' with the guy... at my office, Tender Lender.\nI waited around for him, but he ain't ever showed.\nI ain't never been to that Tr\u00e9s Bien joint, youse hear?Judge:\nI see... That all seems perfectly logical. You had arranged to meet with the victim, but he didn't show up.Godot:\nI've heard it's pretty hard to keep appointments when you're dead.Judge:\nVery well. You may begin your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor!Tigre:\nDidn't I tell you I got a big deal goin' down today? I ain't gonna make my bus now. I'm gonna have to take the express train. That bill's goin' straight to you... Wright!Phoenix:\nGrr...Cross Examination-- The Victim, Glen Elg --Tigre:\nI ain't no liar. I never met Glen Elg.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd yet, your name was written on the victim's calendar!\nTigre:\nGet that horse calendar outta my face! I'm The Tiger, not a lame horse, you' porcupine! Tigers like me eat horses like that for breakfast!\nJudge:\nNo, no, no! Witnesses aren't permitted to eat evidence. Not that they ever would! ... Well, there's was [sic] a case once, where a young lad ate--\nPhoenix:\nA-Anyway! If you had never met the victim before, how do explain this note he left?Tigre:\nThere was some lame guy with that name, though. Wanted to borrow cash from me.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThat's very strange. According to the manager of the firm where the victim worked... ...December 3rd was the date he had to repay his loan. He wasn't due to discuss borrowing money, but repaying what he owed...\nTigre:\nOh. Yeah. Maybe youse right. Whatever it was, it was goin' down at the beginnin' of December.\nPhoenix:\nSo you did meet Mr. Elg, then!?\nTigre:\nHey, Wright. Youse might wanna cool your jets a sec.Tigre:\nI set up a meetin' with the guy... at my office, Tender Lender.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo your meeting wasn't supposed to be at Tr\u00e9s Bien, then?\nTigre:\nWhy would I wanna go to a dump like dat? If I wanna talk with my clients, I got an office decked out for the job. I got the best punching bag youse ever saw in there.\nPhoenix:\n(Not exactly a professional office you've got there, you know...) So you were in your office on the day in question?Tigre:\nI waited around for him, but he ain't ever showed.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe didn't show up?\nGodot:\nHa...! What do you think, Trite? Let's see. How does a dead man get from a French restaurant to a loan shark's office?\nPhoenix:\nAnd you yourself didn't go to Tr\u00e9s Bien?\nTigre:\nWhat are you' tryin' to pin on me here?\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nTigre:\nWhy don't youse come down to my office? We can chat about this thing my way, yeah? I got the best punching bag youse ever saw in there.\nPhoenix:\nNo, no! No need! I'm good, thanks!\nTigre:\nListen up! I ain't got nothin' more to say, except this.Tigre:\nI ain't never been to that Tr\u00e9s Bien joint, youse hear?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nNever? Not even once?\nTigre:\nNot even once. I was in my office the day that went down. I didn't put poison in no kid's coffee. Capice?\nJudge:\nHmm...Present Tr\u00e9s Bien Matches\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Tigre. Is there something you'd like to tell the court about these matches?\"Maya:\nDo you think he really didn't meet Glen Elg?Phoenix:\nNot likely. Because I'm convinced this guy's behind the whole thing.Maya:\nSo you mean... that whole testimony he just gave was a lie?Phoenix:\nOf course. So we can't afford to give him time to think of ways to plug the leaks in it. I've got to nail him while I still can!Phoenix:\nMr. Tigre. Is there something you'd like to tell the court about these matches?Tigre:\nMatches? What youse talkin' about?Phoenix:\nWe found them in your office at Tender Lender. They're from \"that\" restaurant.Tigre:\nWh...!?Phoenix:\nIf you've really never been to Tr\u00e9s Bien before... ...what was a book of the restaurant's matches doing on your desk!?Tigre:\nYouse been snoopin' around in my stuff now too, wiseguy!? What are you', my ball and chain!? Ain't no broad controlling me!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Well, witness? I think it's time you started telling us the truth, don't you?Tigre:\nGrrraaaaargh!Judge:\nS-Sorry! I'm terribly sorry! Forgive me!Tigre:\nI ain't no pussy-cat! I don't go back on what I said! But, OK... I was at the joint that day.Phoenix:\nWh-What!? (Changed from [Whaaat!?] in the original release)Tigre:\nBut listen good, alright? I might've been there, but I still never met that kid.Godot:\nWell, well... Looks like an order just came in for another testimony.Phoenix:\n(I'm this close to proving it was him! He did meet Glen Elg that day. And he did put poison in his coffee! He must have!)Witness Testimony-- At Tr\u00e9s Bien --Tigre:\nI was supposed to meet wid the kid at the restaurant that afternoon.\nWhen I opened the door to the joint, I saw one ugly scene.\nThe guy was laid out over the table, stiff as concrete.\nI figured if the place wasn't hot already, it was gonna be, so I split.\nI heard the cop's sirens on my way out, and I went straight back to my office.Judge:\nI see... You didn't actually meet with him in the end, then. Well, Mr. Wright. Your cross-examination, please.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.Tigre:\nHold it! If I wait around here any longer, I ain't even gonna make the normal express. No more stupid questions.Godot:\nHa...! No problem. Any time Trite presses you on something irrelevant, I'll see he pays a penalty.Judge:\nM-Mr. Godot! That's my job!Godot:\nYour job is to slam that little hammer of yours and call a guilty verdict. So do it!Judge:\nY-Yes, sir!Tigre:\nThe special express ain't cheap, Wright! Just so youse know since youse payin'!Phoenix:\n(Oh, man. Doesn't the rule of law mean anything around here!?)Cross Examination-- At Tr\u00e9s Bien --Tigre:\nI was supposed to meet wid the kid at the restaurant that afternoon.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo the meeting wasn't due to take place at Tender Lender at all then?\nTigre:\nThe kid was makin' a fuss about comin' into de office. It's always that way when I wanna talk about repayments. Even though I got the best punching bag you' ever seen if there are any \"issues\".\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe it's because of the punching bag that people are scared to come?) So that's why you decided to meet at Tr\u00e9s Bien?\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHa...! You're going over old ground again, Trite.\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry.\nGodot:\nYou just earned yourself a penalty. Now suck it down!\nJudge:\nYou will suck down the penalty, Mr. Wright. And you will like it!\nPhoenix:\n(Thank you, sir, may I have another!)Tigre:\nWhen I opened the door to the joint, I saw one ugly scene.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAn \"ugly scene\"? What do you mean?\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nThe witness has already told us, Trite. Which makes that question... irrelevant!\nPhoenix:\nB-But...!\nGodot:\nI limit myself to 17 cups of coffee during a trial. That's the rule. You better limit the number of times you take a penalty, Trite. Or your guts will look like the inside of a chimney! Ashen!\nJudge:\nDon't make me burn you again, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I shouldn't have pressed him on that.)\nTigre:\nGuess I'm gonna make that special express after all.\nJudge:\nSo, to recap... This \"ugly scene\" you saw was...?Present Tr\u00e9s Bien Floor Plans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"You're something of a loan collecting pro, aren't you, Mr. Tigre?\"Tigre:\nThe guy was laid out over the table, stiff as concrete.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou mean you saw Glen Elg's dead body?\nTigre:\nI guess I did. But I only saw him from behind. He was wearin' some raggy bit of cloth he called a hat.\nPhoenix:\nAnd what time was this?\nTigre:\nI dunno.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nTigre:\nYou' know what winds me up more than anythin' else in the world? Watches! Round watches! I ain't gonna pollute my paws wid some tickin' henpecker!\nJudge:\nOut of interest, Mr. Tigre, what winds you up the second most?\nTigre:\nHuh? Whad'youse think!? Square watches!\nPhoenix:\n(Is this guy for real!?)\nTigre:\nLook, all I need to know was that somethin' bad was goin' down in that place.Present Tr\u00e9s Bien Floor Plans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"You're something of a loan collecting pro, aren't you, Mr. Tigre?\"Tigre:\nI figured if the place wasn't hot already, it was gonna be, so I split.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you didn't actually set foot inside the restaurant, then?\nTigre:\nThe Tiger is a busy cat. I don't hang around for no one. I ain't got time to be caught up in no murder investigation.\nPhoenix:\nSo, when exactly did you pick up the matches?\nGodot:\nThere are matches just inside the front door. Our detective friend wound up in trouble with the chef after taking 5 books home.\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Gumshoe... It's almost enough to make a man cry...)Tigre:\nI heard the cop's sirens on my way out, and I went straight back to my office.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou went straight back? Did a bout of guilt suddenly hit you for what you did?\nTigre:\nWhat're youse trying to say!? You' tryin' to tell me youse ain't never been guilty of nothin'?\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nGodot:\nWe all have our crosses to bear. We all have to swallow the dark secrets we hide... ...Like this!\nPhoenix:\n(The courtroom's not exactly the place to talk about dark secrets, is it?)\nJudge:\nIt seems you've done it again, Mr. Wright. Another irrelevant line of questioning. I must impose a penalty accordingly!\nPhoenix:\n(How about a penalty for those two jokers and the garbage they keep coming up with!?)Maya:\nWell, Nick? What do you think?Phoenix:\nHe's running out of ways to avoid the truth. I need to press him fast before he has time to think things through. I've got to come right back at him with a contradiction!Maya:\nBe careful what you press him on, though, or you'll get penalized, OK?Phoenix:\nYou're something of a loan collecting pro, aren't you, Mr. Tigre?Tigre:\nNo one escapes The Tiger's clutches!Phoenix:\nWell I'm something of a lie detecting pro.Tigre:\n...Phoenix:\nAnd no one escapes The Phoenix's clutches! I think it's time we got something straight.Godot:\nWhat's this, Trite? A new line of irrelevant questioning?Phoenix:\nThese are the floor plans of the crime scene. You say you were standing at the entrance, Mr. Tigre? From there, your field of vision would have covered an area something like... this.Judge:\nIndeed. The witness would have had a clear view of the victim's seat.Tigre:\nIsn't that what I just said? I saw the back of the kid's head.Phoenix:\nUnfortunately for you, that is not possible. If the court would think back, you'll remember that between each of the tables... ...is a tall partition!Judge:\nWhy...! That's true!Phoenix:\nNow look at the plans again! The truth is painfully obvious! From the entrance, the field of vision of any customer walking in... ...ends here!Tigre:\n...Phoenix:\nSo, from the entrance of Tr\u00e9s Bien, you couldn't have seen the victim's seat. But you did see the victim that day... because you met with him!Godot:Godot:\nWrong! Have you forgotten the old man's testimony yesterday? The victim was alone at his table.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nBut the defense just proved that point to be moot! The \"victim\" witnessed by Mr. Kudo was not Glen Elg, but a fake!Godot:\nWhat!?Phoenix:\nIn order to have Mr. Kudo falsely testify... ...the real killer posed as the victim he had just killed and acted out a charade!Judge:\nThat will do! This trial has gone on long enough without the obvious question being answered. Who exactly was this \"real killer\" who impersonated the victim?Phoenix:\n...!Judge:\nYou say the killer murdered Glen Elg... ...and then impersonated his victim in a performance for Victor Kudo? In that case, Mr. Wright, reveal the identity of this \"criminal\" to the court!Present Furio Tigre profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Obviously...\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nObviously, it's the person you least expect! Um... What's the matter, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nOh, nothing! I just dropped my pen again. Don't mind me. Carry on with the proceedings as normal.\nMaya:\nBetter think again while he's down there, Nick.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I should've picked the obvious choice...)\nJudge:\nVery good. I've found my pen now. So, allow me to pose the question again, Mr. Wright.\nLeads back to:\n\"You say the killer murdered Glen Elg...\"Phoenix:\nObviously... ...the killer is Furio Tigre! No one else could have done it.Judge:\nWh-What!? Well, witness?Tigre:\n... Grrrah ha hah! Now that's cute! Youse think you can pin this on The Tiger!? Maybe youse don't understand. The Tiger is king of the jungle! So I dares you' to say it again! Come on! You' got the guts!?Judge:\nY-Y-You can't threaten m-me, Mr. Tigre! I-It's the defense! Go ahead and tell the witness, Mr. Wright! Mr. Wriiight!Tigre:\nSounds to me like it must be you', old man. Youse got guts, I'll give you that.Judge:\nM-M-Mr. Wright! Do not leave me to handle this alone!Godot:\n...Ha...! Perhaps I can end this embarrassment.Judge:\nM-Mr. Godot!Godot:\nLet's just go back over Mr. Kudo's testimony one more time. The old man didn't see just the victim! Oh, no, no, no.Kudo:\nThe serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it! There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there!Godot:\nWas the victim he saw the real victim or not? That doesn't matter. The fact remains, he saw the accused put the poison into the coffee!Judge:\n...! Yes, it was the waitress who poisoned the coffee--Phoenix:Phoenix:\nV-Very impressive, Mr. Godot. ...Waiting for my absence to launch your attack!Godot:\nHa...! Found your pen at last, Trite?Phoenix:\nIt was in my pocket. *ahem* But anyway... Mr. Kudo witnessed two people that day. He saw the victim, the \"supposed\" Mr. Glen Elg, and the \"waitress\"... from behind.Judge:\nYes... Your point, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nI think the conclusion is obvious. If this \"Glen Elg\" was really the killer in disguise... ...then surely it's possible the \"waitress\" was also part of the show.Judge:\nWhat!? You mean, the waitress was an imposter as well!?Phoenix:\nThe defendant, Ms. Byrde, fell unconscious immediately after the incident. And someone used her fainting to hatch an elaborate plan to pin the murder on her!Judge:\nWho on earth was it!? Who was this \"waitress\" that Mr. Kudo witnessed?Present Viola Cadaverini profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"W-Who is this woman?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nObviously, it's the person you least expect! Um... What's the matter, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nOh, nothing! I just dropped my pen again. Don't mind me. Carry on with the proceedings as normal.\nMaya:\nBetter think again while he's down there, Nick.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I should've picked the obvious choice...)\nJudge:\nVery good. I've found my pen now. So, allow me to pose the question again, Mr. Wright.\nLeads back to:\n\"Who on earth was it!?\"Judge:\nW-Who is this woman?Phoenix:\nHer name is Viola Cadaverini. She's an employee of Tender Lender.Tigre:\nYouse makin' a big mistake... D'you know who Violetta's grandfather is? You' betta be goin' home in an armored truck tonight, if you' know what I mean...Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nStop shaking, Nick!Phoenix:\nWh-Where was I? Yes, the defendant, Ms. Byrde, has stated the following...Byrde:\nWell, when I took the coffee over to the victim's table... ...it's true there was another customer in the restaurant.Byrde:\nUmm... She was sort of creepy... And she had a kind of cackling laugh.Tigre:\n...Phoenix:\nThere are just too many contradictions in this case. The \"second man\" at the victim's table who nobody but Ms. Byrde seems to have seen. The earpiece worn by the victim in his left ear when that eardrum was ruptured! And the radio show he was supposedly listening to half an hour after it was over. There is only one logical explanation that clears up all of these contradictions! The whole incident took place twice! Once for real, and once for show! And, Mr. Furio Tigre, the only person who could have committed the crime... ...was you!Tigre:\n... ......Judge:\nW-Witness? What have you got to say?Tigre:\n... That's cute!Judge:\nS-Sorry?Tigre:\nYouse alright. I could do with a guy like you' around.Phoenix:\nWh-What do you mean?Tigre:\nOK, I'm in on this game! I'm gonna have to charter a jet to get me to my meetin' now, but... ...I'm gonna give youse one more thing to think about before I go.Phoenix:\nSomething to think about?Tigre:\nYouse got it all wrapped up nice, huh, Wright? But youse missed out one real important thing!Phoenix:\nBut that can't be!Tigre:\nI was in the joint that day. And I met that kid, too.Phoenix:\n...!Tigre:\nBut I couldn't have poisoned him, youse hear?Judge:\nWhat!? Do you really expect us to believe you now, Mr. Tigre?Godot:\nHa...! What a troublemaker.Phoenix:\nT-Troublemaker...?Godot:\nLooks like we're going to need another one for the road. One more steaming cup of hot testimony!Judge:\nIndeed. Witness, you will explain yourself to the court. I will give you one more chance to testify. What happened that day at Tr\u00e9s Bien between yourself and the victim?Witness Testimony-- Ties to the Victim --Tigre:\nYeah, I loaned Elg cash. About 100,000 dollars.\nThat day, we was due to have a little chat. The kid had hit his payback date, see?\nSo anyway, he tells me he's got no way to pay up.\nI'm about to flatten the guy, when he starts screamin'.\n\"Yesss! I won! Half a million bucks!\" He got lucky, you' know. Real lucky.\nIf that waitress hadn't done what she done, everythin' woulda been over.Judge:\nNow, I see that the principal amount you loaned to Mr. Elg was 50,000 dollars...Tigre:\nYeah, well. Youse got the vig to take into account. Interest builds up fast, you' know.Phoenix:\n(That's faster than fast! 100,000 dollars is twice his principal!)Judge:\nAnd the repayment deadline was December 3rd, the day of the incident in question.Tigre:\nYeah. He was one lucky kid! He got that half a million just in time. So I ain't have no reason to kill the kid. And if I ain't got no motive, you ain't got no case!Phoenix:\n(His motive? Hmm... He has to have one, but what is it?)Cross Examination",

      "newContext": "-- At Tr\u00e9s Bien --Tigre:\nI was supposed to meet wid the kid at the restaurant that afternoon.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo the meeting wasn't due to take place at Tender Lender at all then?\nTigre:\nThe kid was makin' a fuss about comin' into de office. It's always that way when I wanna talk about repayments. Even though I got the best punching bag you' ever seen if there are any \"issues\".\nPhoenix:\n(Maybe it's because of the punching bag that people are scared to come?) So that's why you decided to meet at Tr\u00e9s Bien?\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHa...! You're going over old ground again, Trite.\nPhoenix:\nS-Sorry.\nGodot:\nYou just earned yourself a penalty. Now suck it down!\nJudge:\nYou will suck down the penalty, Mr. Wright. And you will like it!\nPhoenix:\n(Thank you, sir, may I have another!)Tigre:\nWhen I opened the door to the joint, I saw one ugly scene.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAn \"ugly scene\"? What do you mean?\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nThe witness has already told us, Trite. Which makes that question... irrelevant!\nPhoenix:\nB-But...!\nGodot:\nI limit myself to 17 cups of coffee during a trial. That's the rule. You better limit the number of times you take a penalty, Trite. Or your guts will look like the inside of a chimney! Ashen!\nJudge:\nDon't make me burn you again, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I shouldn't have pressed him on that.)\nTigre:\nGuess I'm gonna make that special express after all.\nJudge:\nSo, to recap... This \"ugly scene\" you saw was...?Present Tr\u00e9s Bien Floor Plans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"You're something of a loan collecting pro, aren't you, Mr. Tigre?\"Tigre:\nThe guy was laid out over the table, stiff as concrete.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou mean you saw Glen Elg's dead body?\nTigre:\nI guess I did. But I only saw him from behind. He was wearin' some raggy bit of cloth he called a hat.\nPhoenix:\nAnd what time was this?\nTigre:\nI dunno.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nTigre:\nYou' know what winds me up more than anythin' else in the world? Watches! Round watches! I ain't gonna pollute my paws wid some tickin' henpecker!\nJudge:\nOut of interest, Mr. Tigre, what winds you up the second most?\nTigre:\nHuh? Whad'youse think!? Square watches!\nPhoenix:\n(Is this guy for real!?)\nTigre:\nLook, all I need to know was that somethin' bad was goin' down in that place.Present Tr\u00e9s Bien Floor Plans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"You're something of a loan collecting pro, aren't you, Mr. Tigre?\"Tigre:\nI figured if the place wasn't hot already, it was gonna be, so I split.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you didn't actually set foot inside the restaurant, then?\nTigre:\nThe Tiger is a busy cat. I don't hang around for no one. I ain't got time to be caught up in no murder investigation.\nPhoenix:\nSo, when exactly did you pick up the matches?\nGodot:\nThere are matches just inside the front door. Our detective friend wound up in trouble with the chef after taking 5 books home.\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Gumshoe... It's almost enough to make a man cry...)Tigre:\nI heard the cop's sirens on my way out, and I went straight back to my office.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou went straight back? Did a bout of guilt suddenly hit you for what you did?\nTigre:\nWhat're youse trying to say!? You' tryin' to tell me youse ain't never been guilty of nothin'?\nPhoenix:\nUm...\nGodot:\nWe all have our crosses to bear. We all have to swallow the dark secrets we hide... ...Like this!\nPhoenix:\n(The courtroom's not exactly the place to talk about dark secrets, is it?)\nJudge:\nIt seems you've done it again, Mr. Wright. Another irrelevant line of questioning. I must impose a penalty accordingly!\nPhoenix:\n(How about a penalty for those two jokers and the garbage they keep coming up with!?)Maya:\nWell, Nick? What do you think?Phoenix:\nHe's running out of ways to avoid the truth. I need to press him fast before he has time to think things through. I've got to come right back at him with a contradiction!Maya:\nBe careful what you press him on, though, or you'll get penalized, OK?Phoenix:\nYou're something of a loan collecting pro, aren't you, Mr. Tigre?Tigre:\nNo one escapes The Tiger's clutches!Phoenix:\nWell I'm something of a lie detecting pro.Tigre:\n...Phoenix:\nAnd no one escapes The Phoenix's clutches! I think it's time we got something straight.Godot:\nWhat's this, Trite? A new line of irrelevant questioning?Phoenix:\nThese are the floor plans of the crime scene. You say you were standing at the entrance, Mr. Tigre? From there, your field of vision would have covered an area something like... this.Judge:\nIndeed. The witness would have had a clear view of the victim's seat.Tigre:\nIsn't that what I just said? I saw the back of the kid's head.Phoenix:\nUnfortunately for you, that is not possible. If the court would think back, you'll remember that between each of the tables... ...is a tall partition!Judge:\nWhy...! That's true!Phoenix:\nNow look at the plans again! The truth is painfully obvious! From the entrance, the field of vision of any customer walking in... ...ends here!Tigre:\n...Phoenix:\nSo, from the entrance of Tr\u00e9s Bien, you couldn't have seen the victim's seat. But you did see the victim that day... because you met with him!Godot:Godot:\nWrong! Have you forgotten the old man's testimony yesterday? The victim was alone at his table.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nBut the defense just proved that point to be moot! The \"victim\" witnessed by Mr. Kudo was not Glen Elg, but a fake!Godot:\nWhat!?Phoenix:\nIn order to have Mr. Kudo falsely testify... ...the real killer posed as the victim he had just killed and acted out a charade!Judge:\nThat will do! This trial has gone on long enough without the obvious question being answered. Who exactly was this \"real killer\" who impersonated the victim?Phoenix:\n...!Judge:\nYou say the killer murdered Glen Elg... ...and then impersonated his victim in a performance for Victor Kudo? In that case, Mr. Wright, reveal the identity of this \"criminal\" to the court!Present Furio Tigre profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Obviously...\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nObviously, it's the person you least expect! Um... What's the matter, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nOh, nothing! I just dropped my pen again. Don't mind me. Carry on with the proceedings as normal.\nMaya:\nBetter think again while he's down there, Nick.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I should've picked the obvious choice...)\nJudge:\nVery good. I've found my pen now. So, allow me to pose the question again, Mr. Wright.\nLeads back to:\n\"You say the killer murdered Glen Elg...\"Phoenix:\nObviously... ...the killer is Furio Tigre! No one else could have done it.Judge:\nWh-What!? Well, witness?Tigre:\n... Grrrah ha hah! Now that's cute! Youse think you can pin this on The Tiger!? Maybe youse don't understand. The Tiger is king of the jungle! So I dares you' to say it again! Come on! You' got the guts!?Judge:\nY-Y-You can't threaten m-me, Mr. Tigre! I-It's the defense! Go ahead and tell the witness, Mr. Wright! Mr. Wriiight!Tigre:\nSounds to me like it must be you', old man. Youse got guts, I'll give you that.Judge:\nM-M-Mr. Wright! Do not leave me to handle this alone!Godot:\n...Ha...! Perhaps I can end this embarrassment.Judge:\nM-Mr. Godot!Godot:\nLet's just go back over Mr. Kudo's testimony one more time. The old man didn't see just the victim! Oh, no, no, no.Kudo:\nThe serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it! There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there!Godot:\nWas the victim he saw the real victim or not? That doesn't matter. The fact remains, he saw the accused put the poison into the coffee!Judge:\n...! Yes, it was the waitress who poisoned the coffee--Phoenix:Phoenix:\nV-Very impressive, Mr. Godot. ...Waiting for my absence to launch your attack!Godot:\nHa...! Found your pen at last, Trite?Phoenix:\nIt was in my pocket. *ahem* But anyway... Mr. Kudo witnessed two people that day. He saw the victim, the \"supposed\" Mr. Glen Elg, and the \"waitress\"... from behind.Judge:\nYes... Your point, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:\nI think the conclusion is obvious. If this \"Glen Elg\" was really the killer in disguise... ...then surely it's possible the \"waitress\" was also part of the show.Judge:\nWhat!? You mean, the waitress was an imposter as well!?Phoenix:\nThe defendant, Ms. Byrde, fell unconscious immediately after the incident. And someone used her fainting to hatch an elaborate plan to pin the murder on her!Judge:\nWho on earth was it!? Who was this \"waitress\" that Mr. Kudo witnessed?Present Viola Cadaverini profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"W-Who is this woman?\"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nObviously, it's the person you least expect! Um... What's the matter, Your Honor?\nJudge:\nOh, nothing! I just dropped my pen again. Don't mind me. Carry on with the proceedings as normal.\nMaya:\nBetter think again while he's down there, Nick.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I should've picked the obvious choice...)\nJudge:\nVery good. I've found my pen now. So, allow me to pose the question again, Mr. Wright.\nLeads back to:\n\"Who on earth was it!?\"Judge:\nW-Who is this woman?Phoenix:\nHer name is Viola Cadaverini. She's an employee of Tender Lender.Tigre:\nYouse makin' a big mistake... D'you know who Violetta's grandfather is? You' betta be goin' home in an armored truck tonight, if you' know what I mean...Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nStop shaking, Nick!Phoenix:\nWh-Where was I? Yes, the defendant, Ms. Byrde, has stated the following...Byrde:\nWell, when I took the coffee over to the victim's table... ...it's true there was another customer in the restaurant.Byrde:\nUmm... She was sort of creepy... And she had a kind of cackling laugh.Tigre:\n...Phoenix:\nThere are just too many contradictions in this case. The \"second man\" at the victim's table who nobody but Ms. Byrde seems to have seen. The earpiece worn by the victim in his left ear when that eardrum was ruptured! And the radio show he was supposedly listening to half an hour after it was over. There is only one logical explanation that clears up all of these contradictions! The whole incident took place twice! Once for real, and once for show! And, Mr. Furio Tigre, the only person who could have committed the crime... ...was you!Tigre:\n... ......Judge:\nW-Witness? What have you got to say?Tigre:\n... That's cute!Judge:\nS-Sorry?Tigre:\nYouse alright. I could do with a guy like you' around.Phoenix:\nWh-What do you mean?Tigre:\nOK, I'm in on this game! I'm gonna have to charter a jet to get me to my meetin' now, but... ...I'm gonna give youse one more thing to think about before I go.Phoenix:\nSomething to think about?Tigre:\nYouse got it all wrapped up nice, huh, Wright? But youse missed out one real important thing!Phoenix:\nBut that can't be!Tigre:\nI was in the joint that day. And I met that kid, too.Phoenix:\n...!Tigre:\nBut I couldn't have poisoned him, youse hear?Judge:\nWhat!? Do you really expect us to believe you now, Mr. Tigre?Godot:\nHa...! What a troublemaker.Phoenix:\nT-Troublemaker...?Godot:\nLooks like we're going to need another one for the road. One more steaming cup of hot testimony!Judge:\nIndeed. Witness, you will explain yourself to the court. I will give you one more chance to testify. What happened that day at Tr\u00e9s Bien between yourself and the victim?Witness Testimony-- Ties to the Victim --Tigre:\nYeah, I loaned Elg cash. About 100,000 dollars.\nThat day, we was due to have a little chat. The kid had hit his payback date, see?\nSo anyway, he tells me he's got no way to pay up.\nI'm about to flatten the guy, when he starts screamin'.\n\"Yesss! I won! Half a million bucks!\" He got lucky, you' know. Real lucky.\nIf that waitress hadn't done what she done, everythin' woulda been over.Judge:\nNow, I see that the principal amount you loaned to Mr. Elg was 50,000 dollars...Tigre:\nYeah, well. Youse got the vig to take into account. Interest builds up fast, you' know.Phoenix:\n(That's faster than fast! 100,000 dollars is twice his principal!)Judge:\nAnd the repayment deadline was December 3rd, the day of the incident in question.Tigre:\nYeah. He was one lucky kid! He got that half a million just in time. So I ain't have no reason to kill the kid. And if I ain't got no motive, you ain't got no case!Phoenix:\n(His motive? Hmm... He has to have one, but what is it?)Cross Examination",

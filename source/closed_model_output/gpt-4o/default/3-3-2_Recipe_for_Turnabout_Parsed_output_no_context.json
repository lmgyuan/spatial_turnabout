I guess I should've expected this. Nobody saw the other guy, huh? But he was there when I took the coffee over, sir. Scout's honor!???:\nMaggey!Byrde:\nAck! D-Detective Gumshoe!Gumshoe:\nA-Are you doing alright!? How're you feeling!?Byrde:\n...As if you need to ask either question, sir.Gumshoe:\nDon't let 'em get you down, Maggey. And don't forget to eat well, OK?Byrde:\nRoger!Gumshoe:\nAnd you!Phoenix:\nY-Yes?Gumshoe:\nYou'd better square this case away, got it pal!? Maggey's innocent, you hear!? If you screw up, then I'll be doing some squaring away myself. Squaring away some paperwork for your arrest!Phoenix:\n(I-I think he's serious!)Maya:\nHey, Detective! You're on our side for once, right?Gumshoe:\nYup.Maya:\nSo you'll be able to help Maggey out, right?Byrde:\nReally? Can you, sir!?Gumshoe:\nO... Of course! I've got the simulation under control! I'm gonna be the first witness on the stand today. If something I say doesn't mesh with the facts, make sure you point it out, alright?Phoenix:\nS-Sure.Gumshoe:\nOK. We're forming a united front today, pal. You get me!?Byrde:\nI can't tell you how grateful I am, sir! I've always admired you so much, Detective. I know I can count on you.Maya:\nLooks like it should all go pretty smoothly today, huh?Phoenix:\n(I can only wish...)January 7, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Maggey Byrde.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Godot:\n... Aaah, bitter!Judge:\nMr... Um... Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor?Judge:\nAaaah!Phoenix:\nWh-What's wrong!?Judge:\nNothing. It's just whenever I addressed you in the previous trial, your response was... \"Youse talkin' to me!?\" It was a little, well... intimidating.Phoenix:\nNo, no! That wasn't me. That was the phony Phoenix.Judge:\nI see. So our trusty Phoenix Wright is back with us now, is he?Phoenix:\n(\"Our trusty\"...?)Judge:\nSo, Mr. Godot. Your opening statement, please.Godot:\nMr. Trite... Whether you're a fake or the real deal... We will find out soon enough through this trial today.Phoenix:\nBut I can already tell you! I'm the real Phoenix Wright!Godot:\nI wasn't questioning whether you are Phoenix Wright or not. I was questioning whether you had studied law or not. That's what I intend to find out.Phoenix:\n(There's no denying it. Behind that mask is a man who really hates me for some reason or another!)Judge:\nAs everyone is aware, the court has already given its verdict on this case once. Therefore, I won't stand for irrelevant testimony during this retrial. Nor will I stand for a simple repetition of the evidence presented in the last trial.Phoenix:\n(I'm not planning on repeating anything that phony me said! Trust me!)Judge:\nNow then. Mr. Godot, please summon your first witness.Godot:\nLet's start with the formalities, shall we? Name and occupation?Gumshoe:\n...Judge:\nWitness! State your name for the court!Gumshoe:\nHuh? Oh, sorry, sir! The name's Police Department Detective. Occupation, Dick Gumshoe.Godot:\nOther way around, Detective.Gumshoe:\nHuh? Oh! Sorry. Anyway, I'm the officer in charge of this case since yesterday. Sir!Judge:\nSince yesterday?Gumshoe:\nYeah. The guy who was on the initial investigation's tied up with another case now.Maya:\nI hope Gumshoe's really got everything under control... For everyone's sake.Judge:\nI see. So, Detective Gumshoe... Would you outline for the court the basic facts of the case?Gumshoe:\nY-Y-Yes, sir. The victim's name was Glen Elg. He was a professional programmer. He was on the payroll of Blue Screens Inc., a local company. This is the victim's autopsy report.Judge:\nThe court accepts this into evidence.Glen's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.Gumshoe:\nUm... And here are the floor plans of the restaurant. When the incident took place, the victim was sitting right here. The poisoned coffee was brought over to him by the, um... By the waitress.Judge:\nThe waitress being the accused?Gumshoe:\nYeah... The victim died from poisoning almost immediately after he took a sip of the coffee. At the time of the incident, there were two other people in the restaurant. Mr. Jean Armstrong, the owner and chef. And a regular by the name of Mr. Victor Kudo.Judge:\nHmm... It still seems to be a very straightforward case to me.Tr\u00e9s Bien Floor Plans added to the Court Record.Godot:\nCome, Detective. Take up this hammer. And nail the defendant's coffin shut with your own two hands.Judge:\nNow then, Detective Gumshoe. Let's have your testimony.Gumshoe:\nUmm... Yes, sir...Witness Testimony-- The Incident --Gumshoe:\nWhen the incident took place, the victim was alone at his table, sir.\nWe understand that the guy, Glen Elg, was listening to the radio at the time.\nTraces of poison were found in his coffee cup.\nAnd what we found was potassium cyanide. That stuff really packs a punch!\nAnd, um... it looks like Ms. Byrde might've had, well... some kind of a motive.Judge:\nHmm...Godot:\nUsing the dark, aromatic depths of coffee to conceal the poison... Classy lady!Judge:\nThe facts of this case seem to be ironclad. Mr. Wright. I would ask you to begin your cross-examination, but...Phoenix:\nYes?Judge:\nPlease, no intimidation tricks this time around. Is that understood?Phoenix:\nI already told you! That wasn't me!Cross Examination-- The Incident --Gumshoe:\nWhen the incident took place, the victim was alone at his table, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nCan I stop you for just a minute?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? What is it? Did I say something that contradicts the evidence?\nPhoenix:\n(He'd so desperate for that to be true, he's practically crying!) Your testimony just now doesn't match the testimony given by Ms. Byrde. She claims that there was another man at the victim's table.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's what she said. And I--\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nWhat killer wouldn't say that when faced with a homicide conviction?\nPhoenix:\nHey!\nGodot:\nSadly, her testimony isn't supported by the owner or the other customer. Isn't that right, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, it's true. Their two testimonies tie up on that. They both said there was no other guy at the table.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.)\nMaya:\nIf you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad.\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, maybe the other witnesses just missed him! Perhaps their view of the victim's table was obscured in some way.\nGodot:\nHa...! That argument is as weak as the coffee at Tr\u00e9s Bien, Trite!\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nI have here in my possession a ticket.\nPhoenix:\nA ticket? (Looks more like a photo to me.)\nGodot:\nYes. A one-way ticket to guilty-ville! Population: the defendant! This is a photograph taken from near the entrance to the kitchen.\nJudge:\nThis is the scene as witnessed by the chef, moments after the poisoning took place, correct?\nGodot:\nI think the court will agree that with such a clear view of the scene of the crime... ...how, Mr. Trite, could anyone have overlooked a second person at the table?\nPhoenix:\nUrk!\nJudge:\nIt certainly seems to show the victim's table extremely clearly.\nCrime Photo added to the Court Record.\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after Crime Photo is added to the Court Record)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nCan I stop you for just a minute?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? What is it? Did I say something that contradicts the evidence?\nPhoenix:\n(He'd so desperate for that to be true, he's practically crying!) Your testimony just now doesn't match the testimony given by Ms. Byrde. She claims that there was another man at the victim's table.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's what she said.

They both said there was no other guy at the table.\nJudge:\nHmm...Gumshoe:\nWe understand that the guy, Glen Elg, was listening to the radio at the time.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe was listening to his radio, you say?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. He had a portable radio in his chest pocket.\nMaya:\nMaggey told us that too, didn't she? Something about how \"one of them had some sort of earpiece\".\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.)\nMaya:\nIf you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad.\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd what was it that the victim was listening to on the radio, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? How should I know?\nPhoenix:\n(Thanks a lot... We're now one step closer to the middle of nowhere.)\nMaya:\nThis isn't going very well, is it...?\nJudge:\nHmm... Detective. Could you perhaps tell us about the poison and how it was used?\nLeads back to cross-examinationGumshoe:\nTraces of poison were found in his coffee cup.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, traces of the poison were found in the coffee cup and nowhere else?\nGumshoe:\nNot sure I get you, pal.\nPhoenix:\nWas the poison a liquid? Or was it a powder?\nGumshoe:\nIf I had to put it in layman's terms, I'd say it was a powdery substance.\nPhoenix:\nSo the poison could've been in anything that was on the table. Sugar, salt, pepper...\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHa...! Do you put salt and pepper in your coffee, Trite?\nGumshoe:\nThe victim took his coffee black, with no sugar.\nPhoenix:\nNngh...\nJudge:\nIt seems that the poison could only have been in the coffee.\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.)\nMaya:\nIf you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad.\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely certain that the victim even drank any of his coffee?\nGumshoe:\nHuh!? What do you mean?\nPhoenix:\nAccording to this file, \"the poison was found in the victim's coffee cup.\" But what proof is there that the victim ever drank any of it!?\nGumshoe:\nOh, hey! You're right! That's what I was think--\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nIn case you were wondering, that last objection was for the detective there.\nGumshoe:\nHuh? For me?\nGodot:\n\"Oh, hey! You're right!\"? You may be fooling the court, but I'm not falling for it. If you have the time to waste, you have the time to present that piece of evidence.\nGumshoe:\nTh... THAT piece... sir?\nGodot:\nYes. THAT piece.\nGumshoe:\n... Um... Aheh heh heh! Wh-What piece was it again?\nGodot:\nThis!\nPhoenix:\n(Should I be grateful this coffee's only hot enough to give me 1st degree burns...?)\nGumshoe:\nOh. Now I remember! Um... This is the, uh... victim's coffee cup.\nGodot:\nYes, the victim's cup. Take a good look at the rim.\nJudge:\nOh, yes. It's unmistakable. There is clearly a coffee stain on it.\nGodot:\nConclusive proof that the victim did drink the poisoned coffee that was in this cup. The victim gulped down the bitter death that the waitress brought to him... like this!\nPhoenix:\nUuuurgh!\nGumshoe:\nFor the record, the only prints on the cup were the victim's and the defendant's.\nCoffee Cup added to the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\nUpon further investigation of this cup... we found a certain chemical substance...\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after Coffee Cup is added to the Court Record)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, traces of the poison were found in the coffee cup and nowhere else?\nGumshoe:\nNot sure I get you, pal.\nPhoenix:\nWas the poison a liquid? Or was it a powder?\nGumshoe:\nIf I had to put it in layman's terms, I'd say it was a powdery substance.\nPhoenix:\nSo the poison could've been in anything that was on the table. Sugar, salt, pepper...\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHa...! Do you put salt and pepper in your coffee, Trite?\nGumshoe:\nThe victim took his coffee black, with no sugar.\nPhoenix:\nNngh...\nJudge:\nIt seems that the poison could only have been in the coffee.Gumshoe:\nAnd what we found was potassium cyanide. That stuff really packs a punch!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n(Potassium cyanide? I've heard of that chemical before...) Exactly how strong is this poison, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nIt's... Well... That stuff's lethal! Eat too much, and you're history.\nMaya:\nHow much is too much?\nGodot:\nA lethal dose is 0.2 grams. That's about enough to finish anyone off.\nMaya:\n0.2 grams? How much is that?\nGumshoe:\nYou know when you swab your ears for earwax? Yeah, about that much.\nPhoenix:\n(Earwax, huh? Sounds like something Gumshoe's got an abundance of...)\nJudge:\nHmm... Such a small quantity of poison could have been concealed anywhere.Gumshoe:\nAnd, um... it looks like Ms. Byrde might've had, well... some kind of a motive.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Some kind of a motive\"?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. But if you ask me, it's been blown way out of proportion.\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nYou know what my golden rule is, Detective? Chuck out a bad cup of coffee. You can always get another.\nGumshoe:\nHuh? I don't get it.\nGodot:\nI'm saying, we can always get another witness on the stand, if we have to chuck you out.\nGumshoe:\n*gulp*\nGodot:\nSo stick to the facts, Detective. Now then, what was Ms. Byrde's motive?\nPhoenix:\n(Come on, Gumshoe...)\nGumshoe:\nShe was... They said she wanted to steal a lottery ticket.\nPhoenix:\nI knew it... (That's what we heard yesterday, too.)\nGumshoe:\nIt disappeared from the scene of the crime.\nGodot:\nAnd it wasn't just any lottery ticket. It was a winning ticket for half a million!\nMaya:\nMr. Armstrong knew about the ticket too, didn't he? But he stole the wrong one...\nPhoenix:\n(Then is it possible Maggey stole the winning one? What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.)\nMaya:\nIf you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad.\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWait a minute! The mere fact that the lottery ticket disappeared in no way implicates my client!\nGodot:\nHa...! I have here in my hand... the very ticket in question!\nJudge:\nTh-That's the half a million dollar lottery ticket...?\nGumshoe:\nOne of the female police officers found it when she was conducting a search... ...of the defendant.\nPhoenix:\nWH-WHAAAAAT!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order!\nGodot:\nHa...! She's quite a lucky bird, our little waitress.\nJudge:\nY-You will submit that ticket as evidence to the court! Immediately!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, I'd better keep an eye on that ticket. The way the judge's voice is quivering...)\nVictim's Lottery Ticket added to the Court Record.\nJudge:\nThe ticket was presented to the court in the previous trial, too. But it feels heavier now somehow. H-Half a million dollars, you say...?\nGodot:\nIt's just a scrap of paper. What matters is where it was found, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\n(And that's on Maggey's person, unfortunately...) (Changed from [I bet he wants to say it was found on Maggey's person...] in the original release)\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after Victim's Lottery Ticket is added to the Court Record)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Some kind of a motive\"?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. But if you ask me, it's been blown way out of proportion.\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nYou know what my golden rule is, Detective? Chuck out a bad cup of coffee. You can always get another.\nGumshoe:\nHuh? I don't get it.\nGodot:\nI'm saying, we can always get another witness on the stand, if we have to chuck you out.\nGumshoe:\n*gulp*\nGodot:\nSo stick to the facts, Detective. Now then, what was Ms. Byrde's motive?\nPhoenix:\n(Come on, Gumshoe...)\nGumshoe:\nShe was... They said she wanted to steal a lottery ticket.\nPhoenix:\nI knew it... (That's what we heard yesterday, too.)\nGumshoe:\nIt disappeared from the scene of the crime.\nGodot:\nAnd it wasn't just any lottery ticket. It was a winning ticket for half a million!\nMaya:\nMr. Armstrong knew about the ticket too, didn't he? But he stole the wrong one...\nPhoenix:\n(Then is it possible Maggey stole the winning one?)Maya:\nYou really think there are any contradictions in this testimony?Phoenix:\nTo be honest, I don't know.Maya:\nBut Gumshoe told us out in the lobby. He said we'd be forming a united front, right? How will we win the case if he doesn't throw us a line?Phoenix:\n(I don't have a whole lot of options right now... The best I can do is gather the facts together, I guess.)After selecting \"Press harder\" upon pressing first, third, and fifth statements:Judge:\nThat's enough! The facts of this case seem overwhelmingly clear to me. The defendant had ample opportunity to commit the crime of which she is charged. Furthermore, it seems beyond reasonable doubt that she did indeed commit this crime.Godot:\nI like an old man who knows the score.Judge:\nThere is also the matter of the half a million dollar lottery ticket. That alone provides a very credible motive. I mean, for that sum of money even I might be tempted to bend the rules!Godot:\nI don't mind an old man who is weak to the siren call of money.Maya:\nNot good, Nick... The evidence against Maggey is starting to pile up fast.Phoenix:\nYeah, that's because the court has ruled guilty once already.Godot:\nI'd say it's about time to wrap up this repeat performance... ...with one final, decisive piece of evidence.Phoenix:\n(He's got more evidence against Maggey!?)Godot:\nThis is the apron the delightful Ms. Byrde was wearing at the time.Maya:\nWow... That's not the cleanest apron I've seen...Phoenix:\nTh-That stain looks like...! (It can't be... blood, can it!?)Godot:\nHa...! It seems the star of our play was a little flustered... And somehow spilled coffee on herself.Phoenix:\nThe coffee!? That's not exactly the first thing that caught my eye...Godot:\nOf course. The coffee stain isn't the most interesting thing about this apron. No, there's something else that stands out even more.Judge:\nSomething else? I presume you mean...Godot:\nOf course. I'm referring to the pocket.Phoenix:\nThe... pocket?Godot:\nA search carried out right after the incident uncovered this... Potassium cyanide. The very poison used by the killer, was in her apron pocket!Phoenix:\nA bottle of poison... In Maggey's pocket?Gumshoe:\nYeah. And Maggey's prints were the only ones on it.Phoenix:\nWHAAAT!?Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! The court will accept these items into evidence.Apron added to the Court Record.Potassium Cyanide added to the Court Record.Judge:\nThere's something still bothering me, Mr. Godot. Why have you not explained the bloodstain to the court?Godot:\nBloodstain? What bloodstain would that be?Judge:\nDon't play games, prosecutor! The blood-colored stain that's smeared all over the apron!Godot:\nThat's ridiculous! No one told me anything about a bloodstain!Phoenix:\n(You don't need to be told! Just look at it!)Godot:\nWell, Detective!? Could this stain really be... BLOOD!?Gumshoe:\nN-No way, sir! That's... It's just ketchup. Sir.Phoenix:\nKetchup!?Gumshoe:\nShe must've gotten some on her an apron while taking someone their breakfast that day.Judge:\n... You could have spoken up a little sooner, Detective Gumshoe!Godot:\nPull a stunt like that again, and I'll have you drink 17 cups of ketchup, witness!Gumshoe:\nUnnngh... I thought everyone knew what it was already.Judge:\nHmm... I haven't seen anything yet to make me doubt the last verdict I ruled on this case.Phoenix:\n...!Judge:\nThe motive, the opportunity, and the supporting evidence... They have all been clearly established.Godot:\nWell, Trite... It seems you really are a phony after all.Phoenix:\n(Argh! You really know how to drive a man nuts!)Judge:\nWitness, please continue with your testimony. Describe for the court the crime scene and the findings of your investigation there.Witness Testimony-- The Investigation --Gumshoe:\nThe crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.\nPoor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her.\nThe victim didn't have any identification on him.\nBut we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly.\nWhen Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison.\nAnd that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene.Judge:\nHmm... You identified the victim and secured your prime suspect... Very good.Godot:\nLast chance to convince the court you're a real lawyer, Trite!Phoenix:\n...!Godot:\nDon't court on any more cross-examinations after this one! So, let the fun begin!Cross Examination",

What is it? Did I say something that contradicts the evidence?\nPhoenix:\n(He'd so desperate for that to be true, he's practically crying!) Your testimony just now doesn't match the testimony given by Ms. Byrde. She claims that there was another man at the victim's table.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's what she said. And I--\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nWhat killer wouldn't say that when faced with a homicide conviction?\nPhoenix:\nHey!\nGodot:\nSadly, her testimony isn't supported by the owner or the other customer. Isn't that right, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, it's true. Their two testimonies tie up on that. They both said there was no other guy at the table.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.)\nMaya:\nIf you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad.\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, maybe the other witnesses just missed him! Perhaps their view of the victim's table was obscured in some way.\nGodot:\nHa...! That argument is as weak as the coffee at Tr\u00e9s Bien, Trite!\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nI have here in my possession a ticket.\nPhoenix:\nA ticket? (Looks more like a photo to me.)\nGodot:\nYes. A one-way ticket to guilty-ville! Population: the defendant! This is a photograph taken from near the entrance to the kitchen.\nJudge:\nThis is the scene as witnessed by the chef, moments after the poisoning took place, correct?\nGodot:\nI think the court will agree that with such a clear view of the scene of the crime... ...how, Mr. Trite, could anyone have overlooked a second person at the table?\nPhoenix:\nUrk!\nJudge:\nIt certainly seems to show the victim's table extremely clearly.\nCrime Photo added to the Court Record.\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after Crime Photo is added to the Court Record)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nCan I stop you for just a minute?\nGumshoe:\nHuh?

Isn't that right, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, it's true. Their two testimonies tie up on that. They both said there was no other guy at the table.\nJudge:\nHmm...Gumshoe:\nWe understand that the guy, Glen Elg, was listening to the radio at the time.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe was listening to his radio, you say?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. He had a portable radio in his chest pocket.\nMaya:\nMaggey told us that too, didn't she? Something about how \"one of them had some sort of earpiece\".\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, I should leave it alone.

How should I know?\nPhoenix:\n(Thanks a lot... We're now one step closer to the middle of nowhere.)\nMaya:\nThis isn't going very well, is it...?\nJudge:\nHmm... Detective. Could you perhaps tell us about the poison and how it was used?\nLeads back to cross-examinationGumshoe:\nTraces of poison were found in his coffee cup.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, traces of the poison were found in the coffee cup and nowhere else?\nGumshoe:\nNot sure I get you, pal.\nPhoenix:\nWas the poison a liquid? Or was it a powder?\nGumshoe:\nIf I had to put it in layman's terms, I'd say it was a powdery substance.\nPhoenix:\nSo the poison could've been in anything that was on the table. Sugar, salt, pepper...\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHa...! Do you put salt and pepper in your coffee, Trite?\nGumshoe:\nThe victim took his coffee black, with no sugar.\nPhoenix:\nNngh...\nJudge:\nIt seems that the poison could only have been in the coffee.\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, I should leave it alone.

What do you mean?\nPhoenix:\nAccording to this file, \"the poison was found in the victim's coffee cup.\" But what proof is there that the victim ever drank any of it!?\nGumshoe:\nOh, hey! You're right! That's what I was think--\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nIn case you were wondering, that last objection was for the detective there.\nGumshoe:\nHuh? For me?\nGodot:\n\"Oh, hey! You're right!\"? You may be fooling the court, but I'm not falling for it. If you have the time to waste, you have the time to present that piece of evidence.\nGumshoe:\nTh... THAT piece... sir?\nGodot:\nYes. THAT piece.\nGumshoe:\n... Um... Aheh heh heh! Wh-What piece was it again?\nGodot:\nThis!\nPhoenix:\n(Should I be grateful this coffee's only hot enough to give me 1st degree burns...?)\nGumshoe:\nOh. Now I remember! Um... This is the, uh... victim's coffee cup.\nGodot:\nYes, the victim's cup. Take a good look at the rim.\nJudge:\nOh, yes. It's unmistakable. There is clearly a coffee stain on it.\nGodot:\nConclusive proof that the victim did drink the poisoned coffee that was in this cup. The victim gulped down the bitter death that the waitress brought to him... like this!\nPhoenix:\nUuuurgh!\nGumshoe:\nFor the record, the only prints on the cup were the victim's and the defendant's.\nCoffee Cup added to the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\nUpon further investigation of this cup... we found a certain chemical substance...\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after Coffee Cup is added to the Court Record)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, traces of the poison were found in the coffee cup and nowhere else?\nGumshoe:\nNot sure I get you, pal.\nPhoenix:\nWas the poison a liquid?

Do you put salt and pepper in your coffee, Trite?\nGumshoe:\nThe victim took his coffee black, with no sugar.\nPhoenix:\nNngh...\nJudge:\nIt seems that the poison could only have been in the coffee.Gumshoe:\nAnd what we found was potassium cyanide. That stuff really packs a punch!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n(Potassium cyanide? I've heard of that chemical before...) Exactly how strong is this poison, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nIt's... Well... That stuff's lethal! Eat too much, and you're history.\nMaya:\nHow much is too much?\nGodot:\nA lethal dose is 0.2 grams. That's about enough to finish anyone off.\nMaya:\n0.2 grams? How much is that?\nGumshoe:\nYou know when you swab your ears for earwax? Yeah, about that much.\nPhoenix:\n(Earwax, huh? Sounds like something Gumshoe's got an abundance of...)\nJudge:\nHmm... Such a small quantity of poison could have been concealed anywhere.Gumshoe:\nAnd, um... it looks like Ms. Byrde might've had, well... some kind of a motive.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Some kind of a motive\"?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. But if you ask me, it's been blown way out of proportion.\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nYou know what my golden rule is, Detective? Chuck out a bad cup of coffee. You can always get another.\nGumshoe:\nHuh? I don't get it.\nGodot:\nI'm saying, we can always get another witness on the stand, if we have to chuck you out.\nGumshoe:\n*gulp*\nGodot:\nSo stick to the facts, Detective. Now then, what was Ms. Byrde's motive?\nPhoenix:\n(Come on, Gumshoe...)\nGumshoe:\nShe was... They said she wanted to steal a lottery ticket.\nPhoenix:\nI knew it... (That's what we heard yesterday, too.)\nGumshoe:\nIt disappeared from the scene of the crime.\nGodot:\nAnd it wasn't just any lottery ticket. It was a winning ticket for half a million!\nMaya:\nMr. Armstrong knew about the ticket too, didn't he? But he stole the wrong one...\nPhoenix:\n(Then is it possible Maggey stole the winning one? What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.)\nMaya:\nIf you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad.\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWait a minute! The mere fact that the lottery ticket disappeared in no way implicates my client!\nGodot:\nHa...! I have here in my hand... the very ticket in question!\nJudge:\nTh-That's the half a million dollar lottery ticket...?\nGumshoe:\nOne of the female police officers found it when she was conducting a search... ...of the defendant.\nPhoenix:\nWH-WHAAAAAT!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order!\nGodot:\nHa...! She's quite a lucky bird, our little waitress.\nJudge:\nY-You will submit that ticket as evidence to the court! Immediately!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, I'd better keep an eye on that ticket. The way the judge's voice is quivering...)\nVictim's Lottery Ticket added to the Court Record.\nJudge:\nThe ticket was presented to the court in the previous trial, too. But it feels heavier now somehow. H-Half a million dollars, you say...?\nGodot:\nIt's just a scrap of paper. What matters is where it was found, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\n(And that's on Maggey's person, unfortunately...) (Changed from [I bet he wants to say it was found on Maggey's person...] in the original release)\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after Victim's Lottery Ticket is added to the Court Record)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Some kind of a motive\"?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. But if you ask me, it's been blown way out of proportion.\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nYou know what my golden rule is, Detective? Chuck out a bad cup of coffee. You can always get another.\nGumshoe:\nHuh?

But he stole the wrong one...\nPhoenix:\n(Then is it possible Maggey stole the winning one?)Maya:\nYou really think there are any contradictions in this testimony?Phoenix:\nTo be honest, I don't know.Maya:\nBut Gumshoe told us out in the lobby. He said we'd be forming a united front, right? How will we win the case if he doesn't throw us a line?Phoenix:\n(I don't have a whole lot of options right now... The best I can do is gather the facts together, I guess.)After selecting \"Press harder\" upon pressing first, third, and fifth statements:Judge:\nThat's enough! The facts of this case seem overwhelmingly clear to me. The defendant had ample opportunity to commit the crime of which she is charged. Furthermore, it seems beyond reasonable doubt that she did indeed commit this crime.Godot:\nI like an old man who knows the score.Judge:\nThere is also the matter of the half a million dollar lottery ticket. That alone provides a very credible motive. I mean, for that sum of money even I might be tempted to bend the rules!Godot:\nI don't mind an old man who is weak to the siren call of money.Maya:\nNot good, Nick... The evidence against Maggey is starting to pile up fast.Phoenix:\nYeah, that's because the court has ruled guilty once already.Godot:\nI'd say it's about time to wrap up this repeat performance... ...with one final, decisive piece of evidence.Phoenix:\n(He's got more evidence against Maggey!?)Godot:\nThis is the apron the delightful Ms. Byrde was wearing at the time.Maya:\nWow... That's not the cleanest apron I've seen...Phoenix:\nTh-That stain looks like...! (It can't be... blood, can it!?)Godot:\nHa...! It seems the star of our play was a little flustered... And somehow spilled coffee on herself.Phoenix:\nThe coffee!? That's not exactly the first thing that caught my eye...Godot:\nOf course. The coffee stain isn't the most interesting thing about this apron. No, there's something else that stands out even more.Judge:\nSomething else? I presume you mean...Godot:\nOf course. I'm referring to the pocket.Phoenix:\nThe... pocket?Godot:\nA search carried out right after the incident uncovered this... Potassium cyanide. The very poison used by the killer, was in her apron pocket!Phoenix:\nA bottle of poison... In Maggey's pocket?Gumshoe:\nYeah. And Maggey's prints were the only ones on it.Phoenix:\nWHAAAT!?Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! The court will accept these items into evidence.Apron added to the Court Record.Potassium Cyanide added to the Court Record.Judge:\nThere's something still bothering me, Mr. Godot. Why have you not explained the bloodstain to the court?Godot:\nBloodstain? What bloodstain would that be?Judge:\nDon't play games, prosecutor! The blood-colored stain that's smeared all over the apron!Godot:\nThat's ridiculous! No one told me anything about a bloodstain!Phoenix:\n(You don't need to be told! Just look at it!)Godot:\nWell, Detective!? Could this stain really be... BLOOD!?Gumshoe:\nN-No way, sir! That's... It's just ketchup. Sir.Phoenix:\nKetchup!?Gumshoe:\nShe must've gotten some on her an apron while taking someone their breakfast that day.Judge:\n... You could have spoken up a little sooner, Detective Gumshoe!Godot:\nPull a stunt like that again, and I'll have you drink 17 cups of ketchup, witness!Gumshoe:\nUnnngh... I thought everyone knew what it was already.Judge:\nHmm... I haven't seen anything yet to make me doubt the last verdict I ruled on this case.Phoenix:\n...!Judge:\nThe motive, the opportunity, and the supporting evidence... They have all been clearly established.Godot:\nWell, Trite... It seems you really are a phony after all.Phoenix:\n(Argh! You really know how to drive a man nuts!)Judge:\nWitness, please continue with your testimony. Describe for the court the crime scene and the findings of your investigation there.Witness Testimony-- The Investigation --Gumshoe:\nThe crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.\nPoor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her.\nThe victim didn't have any identification on him.\nBut we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly.\nWhen Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison.\nAnd that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene.Judge:\nHmm... You identified the victim and secured your prime suspect... Very good.Godot:\nLast chance to convince the court you're a real lawyer, Trite!Phoenix:\n...!Godot:\nDon't court on any more cross-examinations after this one! So, let the fun begin!Cross Examination",

I guess I should've expected this. Nobody saw the other guy, huh? But he was there when I took the coffee over, sir. Scout's honor!???:\nMaggey!Byrde:\nAck! D-Detective Gumshoe!Gumshoe:\nA-Are you doing alright!? How're you feeling!?Byrde:\n...As if you need to ask either question, sir.Gumshoe:\nDon't let 'em get you down, Maggey. And don't forget to eat well, OK?Byrde:\nRoger!Gumshoe:\nAnd you!Phoenix:\nY-Yes?Gumshoe:\nYou'd better square this case away, got it pal!? Maggey's innocent, you hear!? If you screw up, then I'll be doing some squaring away myself. Squaring away some paperwork for your arrest!Phoenix:\n(I-I think he's serious!)Maya:\nHey, Detective! You're on our side for once, right?Gumshoe:\nYup.Maya:\nSo you'll be able to help Maggey out, right?Byrde:\nReally? Can you, sir!?Gumshoe:\nO... Of course! I've got the simulation under control! I'm gonna be the first witness on the stand today. If something I say doesn't mesh with the facts, make sure you point it out, alright?Phoenix:\nS-Sure.Gumshoe:\nOK. We're forming a united front today, pal. You get me!?Byrde:\nI can't tell you how grateful I am, sir! I've always admired you so much, Detective. I know I can count on you.Maya:\nLooks like it should all go pretty smoothly today, huh?Phoenix:\n(I can only wish...)January 7, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Maggey Byrde.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Godot:\n... Aaah, bitter!Judge:\nMr... Um... Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor?Judge:\nAaaah!Phoenix:\nWh-What's wrong!?Judge:\nNothing. It's just whenever I addressed you in the previous trial, your response was... \"Youse talkin' to me!?\" It was a little, well... intimidating.Phoenix:\nNo, no! That wasn't me. That was the phony Phoenix.Judge:\nI see. So our trusty Phoenix Wright is back with us now, is he?Phoenix:\n(\"Our trusty\"...?)Judge:\nSo, Mr. Godot. Your opening statement, please.Godot:\nMr. Trite... Whether you're a fake or the real deal... We will find out soon enough through this trial today.Phoenix:\nBut I can already tell you! I'm the real Phoenix Wright!Godot:\nI wasn't questioning whether you are Phoenix Wright or not. I was questioning whether you had studied law or not. That's what I intend to find out.Phoenix:\n(There's no denying it. Behind that mask is a man who really hates me for some reason or another!)Judge:\nAs everyone is aware, the court has already given its verdict on this case once. Therefore, I won't stand for irrelevant testimony during this retrial. Nor will I stand for a simple repetition of the evidence presented in the last trial.Phoenix:\n(I'm not planning on repeating anything that phony me said! Trust me!)Judge:\nNow then. Mr. Godot, please summon your first witness.Godot:\nLet's start with the formalities, shall we? Name and occupation?Gumshoe:\n...Judge:\nWitness! State your name for the court!Gumshoe:\nHuh? Oh, sorry, sir! The name's Police Department Detective. Occupation, Dick Gumshoe.Godot:\nOther way around, Detective.Gumshoe:\nHuh? Oh! Sorry. Anyway, I'm the officer in charge of this case since yesterday. Sir!Judge:\nSince yesterday?Gumshoe:\nYeah. The guy who was on the initial investigation's tied up with another case now.Maya:\nI hope Gumshoe's really got everything under control... For everyone's sake.Judge:\nI see. So, Detective Gumshoe... Would you outline for the court the basic facts of the case?Gumshoe:\nY-Y-Yes, sir. The victim's name was Glen Elg. He was a professional programmer. He was on the payroll of Blue Screens Inc., a local company. This is the victim's autopsy report.Judge:\nThe court accepts this into evidence.Glen's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.Gumshoe:\nUm... And here are the floor plans of the restaurant. When the incident took place, the victim was sitting right here. The poisoned coffee was brought over to him by the, um... By the waitress.Judge:\nThe waitress being the accused?Gumshoe:\nYeah... The victim died from poisoning almost immediately after he took a sip of the coffee. At the time of the incident, there were two other people in the restaurant. Mr. Jean Armstrong, the owner and chef. And a regular by the name of Mr. Victor Kudo.Judge:\nHmm... It still seems to be a very straightforward case to me.Tr\u00e9s Bien Floor Plans added to the Court Record.Godot:\nCome, Detective. Take up this hammer. And nail the defendant's coffin shut with your own two hands.Judge:\nNow then, Detective Gumshoe. Let's have your testimony.Gumshoe:\nUmm... Yes, sir...Witness Testimony-- The Incident --Gumshoe:\nWhen the incident took place, the victim was alone at his table, sir.\nWe understand that the guy, Glen Elg, was listening to the radio at the time.\nTraces of poison were found in his coffee cup.\nAnd what we found was potassium cyanide. That stuff really packs a punch!\nAnd, um... it looks like Ms. Byrde might've had, well... some kind of a motive.Judge:\nHmm...Godot:\nUsing the dark, aromatic depths of coffee to conceal the poison... Classy lady!Judge:\nThe facts of this case seem to be ironclad. Mr. Wright. I would ask you to begin your cross-examination, but...Phoenix:\nYes?Judge:\nPlease, no intimidation tricks this time around. Is that understood?Phoenix:\nI already told you! That wasn't me!Cross Examination-- The Incident --Gumshoe:\nWhen the incident took place, the victim was alone at his table, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nCan I stop you for just a minute?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? What is it? Did I say something that contradicts the evidence?\nPhoenix:\n(He'd so desperate for that to be true, he's practically crying!) Your testimony just now doesn't match the testimony given by Ms. Byrde. She claims that there was another man at the victim's table.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's what she said. And I--\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nWhat killer wouldn't say that when faced with a homicide conviction?\nPhoenix:\nHey!\nGodot:\nSadly, her testimony isn't supported by the owner or the other customer. Isn't that right, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, it's true. Their two testimonies tie up on that. They both said there was no other guy at the table.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.)\nMaya:\nIf you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad.\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, maybe the other witnesses just missed him! Perhaps their view of the victim's table was obscured in some way.\nGodot:\nHa...! That argument is as weak as the coffee at Tr\u00e9s Bien, Trite!\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nI have here in my possession a ticket.\nPhoenix:\nA ticket? (Looks more like a photo to me.)\nGodot:\nYes. A one-way ticket to guilty-ville! Population: the defendant! This is a photograph taken from near the entrance to the kitchen.\nJudge:\nThis is the scene as witnessed by the chef, moments after the poisoning took place, correct?\nGodot:\nI think the court will agree that with such a clear view of the scene of the crime... ...how, Mr. Trite, could anyone have overlooked a second person at the table?\nPhoenix:\nUrk!\nJudge:\nIt certainly seems to show the victim's table extremely clearly.\nCrime Photo added to the Court Record.\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after Crime Photo is added to the Court Record)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nCan I stop you for just a minute?\nGumshoe:\nHuh?

He had a portable radio in his chest pocket.\nMaya:\nMaggey told us that too, didn't she? Something about how \"one of them had some sort of earpiece\".\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.)\nMaya:\nIf you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad.\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd what was it that the victim was listening to on the radio, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? How should I know?\nPhoenix:\n(Thanks a lot... We're now one step closer to the middle of nowhere.)\nMaya:\nThis isn't going very well, is it...?\nJudge:\nHmm... Detective. Could you perhaps tell us about the poison and how it was used?\nLeads back to cross-examinationGumshoe:\nTraces of poison were found in his coffee cup.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, traces of the poison were found in the coffee cup and nowhere else?\nGumshoe:\nNot sure I get you, pal.\nPhoenix:\nWas the poison a liquid? Or was it a powder?\nGumshoe:\nIf I had to put it in layman's terms, I'd say it was a powdery substance.\nPhoenix:\nSo the poison could've been in anything that was on the table. Sugar, salt, pepper...\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHa...! Do you put salt and pepper in your coffee, Trite?\nGumshoe:\nThe victim took his coffee black, with no sugar.\nPhoenix:\nNngh...\nJudge:\nIt seems that the poison could only have been in the coffee.\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.)\nMaya:\nIf you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad.\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely certain that the victim even drank any of his coffee?\nGumshoe:\nHuh!? What do you mean?\nPhoenix:\nAccording to this file, \"the poison was found in the victim's coffee cup.\" But what proof is there that the victim ever drank any of it!?\nGumshoe:\nOh, hey! You're right! That's what I was think--\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nIn case you were wondering, that last objection was for the detective there.\nGumshoe:\nHuh? For me?\nGodot:\n\"Oh, hey! You're right!\"? You may be fooling the court, but I'm not falling for it. If you have the time to waste, you have the time to present that piece of evidence.\nGumshoe:\nTh... THAT piece... sir?\nGodot:\nYes. THAT piece.\nGumshoe:\n... Um... Aheh heh heh! Wh-What piece was it again?\nGodot:\nThis!\nPhoenix:\n(Should I be grateful this coffee's only hot enough to give me 1st degree burns...?)\nGumshoe:\nOh. Now I remember! Um... This is the, uh... victim's coffee cup.\nGodot:\nYes, the victim's cup. Take a good look at the rim.\nJudge:\nOh, yes. It's unmistakable. There is clearly a coffee stain on it.\nGodot:\nConclusive proof that the victim did drink the poisoned coffee that was in this cup. The victim gulped down the bitter death that the waitress brought to him... like this!\nPhoenix:\nUuuurgh!\nGumshoe:\nFor the record, the only prints on the cup were the victim's and the defendant's.\nCoffee Cup added to the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\nUpon further investigation of this cup... we found a certain chemical substance...\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after Coffee Cup is added to the Court Record)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, traces of the poison were found in the coffee cup and nowhere else?\nGumshoe:\nNot sure I get you, pal.\nPhoenix:\nWas the poison a liquid? Or was it a powder?\nGumshoe:\nIf I had to put it in layman's terms, I'd say it was a powdery substance.\nPhoenix:\nSo the poison could've been in anything that was on the table.

That stuff really packs a punch!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n(Potassium cyanide? I've heard of that chemical before...) Exactly how strong is this poison, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nIt's... Well... That stuff's lethal! Eat too much, and you're history.\nMaya:\nHow much is too much?\nGodot:\nA lethal dose is 0.2 grams. That's about enough to finish anyone off.\nMaya:\n0.2 grams? How much is that?\nGumshoe:\nYou know when you swab your ears for earwax? Yeah, about that much.\nPhoenix:\n(Earwax, huh? Sounds like something Gumshoe's got an abundance of...)\nJudge:\nHmm... Such a small quantity of poison could have been concealed anywhere.Gumshoe:\nAnd, um... it looks like Ms. Byrde might've had, well... some kind of a motive.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Some kind of a motive\"?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. But if you ask me, it's been blown way out of proportion.\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nYou know what my golden rule is, Detective? Chuck out a bad cup of coffee. You can always get another.\nGumshoe:\nHuh? I don't get it.\nGodot:\nI'm saying, we can always get another witness on the stand, if we have to chuck you out.\nGumshoe:\n*gulp*\nGodot:\nSo stick to the facts, Detective. Now then, what was Ms. Byrde's motive?\nPhoenix:\n(Come on, Gumshoe...)\nGumshoe:\nShe was... They said she wanted to steal a lottery ticket.\nPhoenix:\nI knew it... (That's what we heard yesterday, too.)\nGumshoe:\nIt disappeared from the scene of the crime.\nGodot:\nAnd it wasn't just any lottery ticket. It was a winning ticket for half a million!\nMaya:\nMr. Armstrong knew about the ticket too, didn't he? But he stole the wrong one...\nPhoenix:\n(Then is it possible Maggey stole the winning one? What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.)\nMaya:\nIf you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad.\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWait a minute! The mere fact that the lottery ticket disappeared in no way implicates my client!\nGodot:\nHa...! I have here in my hand... the very ticket in question!\nJudge:\nTh-That's the half a million dollar lottery ticket...?\nGumshoe:\nOne of the female police officers found it when she was conducting a search... ...of the defendant.\nPhoenix:\nWH-WHAAAAAT!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order!\nGodot:\nHa...! She's quite a lucky bird, our little waitress.\nJudge:\nY-You will submit that ticket as evidence to the court! Immediately!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, I'd better keep an eye on that ticket. The way the judge's voice is quivering...)\nVictim's Lottery Ticket added to the Court Record.\nJudge:\nThe ticket was presented to the court in the previous trial, too. But it feels heavier now somehow. H-Half a million dollars, you say...?\nGodot:\nIt's just a scrap of paper. What matters is where it was found, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\n(And that's on Maggey's person, unfortunately...) (Changed from [I bet he wants to say it was found on Maggey's person...] in the original release)\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after Victim's Lottery Ticket is added to the Court Record)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Some kind of a motive\"?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. But if you ask me, it's been blown way out of proportion.\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nYou know what my golden rule is, Detective? Chuck out a bad cup of coffee. You can always get another.\nGumshoe:\nHuh?

But he stole the wrong one...\nPhoenix:\n(Then is it possible Maggey stole the winning one?)Maya:\nYou really think there are any contradictions in this testimony?Phoenix:\nTo be honest, I don't know.Maya:\nBut Gumshoe told us out in the lobby. He said we'd be forming a united front, right? How will we win the case if he doesn't throw us a line?Phoenix:\n(I don't have a whole lot of options right now... The best I can do is gather the facts together, I guess.)After selecting \"Press harder\" upon pressing first, third, and fifth statements:Judge:\nThat's enough! The facts of this case seem overwhelmingly clear to me. The defendant had ample opportunity to commit the crime of which she is charged. Furthermore, it seems beyond reasonable doubt that she did indeed commit this crime.Godot:\nI like an old man who knows the score.Judge:\nThere is also the matter of the half a million dollar lottery ticket. That alone provides a very credible motive. I mean, for that sum of money even I might be tempted to bend the rules!Godot:\nI don't mind an old man who is weak to the siren call of money.Maya:\nNot good, Nick... The evidence against Maggey is starting to pile up fast.Phoenix:\nYeah, that's because the court has ruled guilty once already.Godot:\nI'd say it's about time to wrap up this repeat performance... ...with one final, decisive piece of evidence.Phoenix:\n(He's got more evidence against Maggey!?)Godot:\nThis is the apron the delightful Ms. Byrde was wearing at the time.Maya:\nWow... That's not the cleanest apron I've seen...Phoenix:\nTh-That stain looks like...! (It can't be... blood, can it!?)Godot:\nHa...! It seems the star of our play was a little flustered... And somehow spilled coffee on herself.Phoenix:\nThe coffee!? That's not exactly the first thing that caught my eye...Godot:\nOf course. The coffee stain isn't the most interesting thing about this apron. No, there's something else that stands out even more.Judge:\nSomething else? I presume you mean...Godot:\nOf course. I'm referring to the pocket.Phoenix:\nThe... pocket?Godot:\nA search carried out right after the incident uncovered this... Potassium cyanide. The very poison used by the killer, was in her apron pocket!Phoenix:\nA bottle of poison... In Maggey's pocket?Gumshoe:\nYeah. And Maggey's prints were the only ones on it.Phoenix:\nWHAAAT!?Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! The court will accept these items into evidence.Apron added to the Court Record.Potassium Cyanide added to the Court Record.Judge:\nThere's something still bothering me, Mr. Godot. Why have you not explained the bloodstain to the court?Godot:\nBloodstain? What bloodstain would that be?Judge:\nDon't play games, prosecutor! The blood-colored stain that's smeared all over the apron!Godot:\nThat's ridiculous! No one told me anything about a bloodstain!Phoenix:\n(You don't need to be told! Just look at it!)Godot:\nWell, Detective!? Could this stain really be... BLOOD!?Gumshoe:\nN-No way, sir! That's... It's just ketchup. Sir.Phoenix:\nKetchup!?Gumshoe:\nShe must've gotten some on her an apron while taking someone their breakfast that day.Judge:\n... You could have spoken up a little sooner, Detective Gumshoe!Godot:\nPull a stunt like that again, and I'll have you drink 17 cups of ketchup, witness!Gumshoe:\nUnnngh... I thought everyone knew what it was already.Judge:\nHmm... I haven't seen anything yet to make me doubt the last verdict I ruled on this case.Phoenix:\n...!Judge:\nThe motive, the opportunity, and the supporting evidence... They have all been clearly established.Godot:\nWell, Trite... It seems you really are a phony after all.Phoenix:\n(Argh! You really know how to drive a man nuts!)Judge:\nWitness, please continue with your testimony. Describe for the court the crime scene and the findings of your investigation there.Witness Testimony-- The Investigation --Gumshoe:\nThe crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.\nPoor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her.\nThe victim didn't have any identification on him.\nBut we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly.\nWhen Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison.\nAnd that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene.Judge:\nHmm... You identified the victim and secured your prime suspect... Very good.Godot:\nLast chance to convince the court you're a real lawyer, Trite!Phoenix:\n...!Godot:\nDon't court on any more cross-examinations after this one! So, let the fun begin!Cross Examination-- The Investigation --Gumshoe:\nThe crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Scary old man\", Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nThere's an old man who's a regular at the restaurant where the incident happened.\nPhoenix:\n(Ah, we're obviously talking about the same old man...)\nGumshoe:\nOfficers were dispatched right after the report came in, but the old guy still made a fuss. \"What took you so long!?\" Then he hurled abuse at them. And seeds...\nJudge:\nHmm... Seeds...\nGodot:\nHa...! It was nothing! I caught each one with my teeth.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess not even the mighty Godot can avoid being attacked by that guy...)\nGodot:\nThe old man was only other customer in the place at the time. He took his time finding a pay phone apparently, so he was late reporting the crime.Gumshoe:\nPoor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow long was the defendant unconscious for?\nGumshoe:\nThe officers got to the crime scene at around 2:40. Maggey was still out cold in the kitchen at that time. It took another 10 minutes or so before she came to. I woulda liked to have been on the scene myself.\nPhoenix:\n(I bet you would've liked to have carried out the search, too...)\nGumshoe:\nI woulda loved to see Maggey asleep like that, all pretty and peaceful.\nPhoenix:\n(You're a professional detective, Gumshoe. Not a professional bird watcher!)\nGodot:\nSave the romantics for your own time, Detective. All we need to know about is the investigation.\nGumshoe:\nOops! I guess I'm pretty red right now, aren't I?Gumshoe:\nThe victim didn't have any identification on him.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe didn't have any? Are you saying that it was stolen, then?\nGumshoe:\nNo, I don't think so. The victim didn't have a driver's license or even a credit card on him, pal. All he had was 58 cents in his wallet.\nPhoenix:\nFifty-eight cents...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. I can't believe I found someone with less in their wallet than me, pal!\nJudge:\nThe victim sounds like he was a thoroughly miserable young man.\nGodot:\nOr some kind of outlaw... Why not give him a bit of an edge?\nPhoenix:\n(I think I'm on to something here...)Gumshoe:\nBut we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWait a sec!\nGumshoe:\nHuh? D-Did I say something dumb again!?\nPhoenix:\nLet me paraphrase what you just testified to this court. \"The victim didn't have any form of ID on him.\" That's basically what you said, yes?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, basically.\nPhoenix:\nIn that case, how were you able to identify the victim so quickly?\nGumshoe:\n... Oh... That.\nPhoenix:\n(He's so let down, he's got the whole sagging shoulders and puppy eyes thing going...)\nGumshoe:\nThere was a prescription bag on the victim's table along with the lottery ticket.\nGodot:\nIt seems Mr. Glen Elg visited his doctor before he went to Tr\u00e9s Bien.\nGumshoe:\nWe got the victim's name from the medical records of the doc who prescribed the meds.\nJudge:\nHmm... That's a reliable enough source for the court.\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I leave this alone or ask to hear more?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I guess it doesn't really matter how they figured out who the victim was. There are more important avenues to explore.)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nAsk about the prescription bag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo what sort of medicine was in the bag?\nGumshoe:\nWell... Actually, the bag we found was empty.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. Completely empty.\nPhoenix:\n(It was completely empty...?)\nVictim's Prescription Bag added to the Court Record.\nGodot:\nHa...! You're entering an empty paper bag as evidence? Desperate, are you, Trite?\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nNow, what happened with the investigation after that, Detective?\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nAsk about his health insurance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, the victim had no form of identification on him, correct?\nGumshoe:\nYeah.\nPhoenix:\nAnd yet, before arriving at the restaurant, he went to see a doctor. Which means... He must've had his medical insurance card with him!\nJudge:\nOh! That is very true!\nPhoenix:\nThe fact that it hasn't been found points to only one obvious conclusion. The victim's medical card was stolen!\nGodot:\nHa...! True, the victim didn't have a medical insurance card. But why? Because Mr. Glen Elg didn't have medical insurance to begin with!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nJudge:\nHmm... As I thought, a thoroughly miserable young man.\nGodot:\nOr some kind of outlaw... A bit of an edge never hurt anyone.\nMaya:\nLooks like we're off course again, Nick.\nJudge:\nWitness. Please continue with your testimony. Explain for the court the events following the preliminary investigation.\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after Victim's Prescription Bag is added to the Court Record)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWait a sec!\nGumshoe:\nHuh? D-Did I say something dumb again!?\nPhoenix:\nLet me paraphrase what you just testified to this court. \"The victim didn't have any form of ID on him.\" That's basically what you said, yes?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, basically.\nPhoenix:\nIn that case, how were you able to identify the victim so quickly?\nGumshoe:\n...

That's a reliable enough source for the court.Gumshoe:\nWhen Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBut the defendant had been passed out for a while, correct? In that case... Isn't it possible someone planted the evidence in Maggey's pocket!?\nGumshoe:\nHey! Y-Yeah! You've nailed it, pal!\nJudge:\nHmm...\nGumshoe:\nIt happens to me all the time! We had a department party the other day, and when I got home... ...I was wearing the boss's shoes!\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nKeep up this crazy testimony, Detective, and those shoes will end up down your throat!\nGumshoe:\nSorry...\nGodot:\nSo, Trite. \"Someone planted the evidence in Maggey's pocket\"...? That's a pretty bold statement. Care to back it up with some evidence?\nPhoenix:\nUm... Well... (I'd love to, if I had any...)\nJudge:\nIt appears you have no evidence to support your theory, Mr. Wright. Continue with your testimony, witness.Gumshoe:\nAnd that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo the half a million dollar lottery ticket and the bottle of poison were accounted for.\nGumshoe:\nYeah.\nPhoenix:\nInteresting... It's true that those two items are accounted for... ..but wasn't there another lottery ticket that was stolen that day?\nGumshoe:\nOh, yeah. The one the restaurant owner took. He won a whole dollar with it. What a lucky guy, huh?\nPhoenix:\n(And they're just going to let him get away with it...?)\nJudge:\nIt was just one dollar, Detective.\nMaya:\nI guess no one cares when it's that little... Unless it's Gumshoe.Present Victim's Prescription Bag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Detective Gumshoe. I think I should point something out to you.\"Phoenix:\nIf I don't find a hole in this testimony, the judge is going to hand down his verdict!Maya:\nGumshoe isn't giving us anything to work with... And we can't find any contradictions if he doesn't give us something!Phoenix:\nYeah, that's true... But Maggey and Gumshoe are like dumb and dumber. Our only hope is that they were so dumb, they missed something obvious.Maya:\nCome on, Gumshoe! Be the dumbest you've ever been!Phoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe. I think I should point something out to you. There is just one small contradiction in your testimony.Gumshoe:\nOho! Finally! I'm getting all anxious just waiting, so hurry up, will you?Phoenix:\nYou testified that, \"nothing else was missing from the crime scene.\" However! The prescription bag you mentioned was empty! Did the officers recover the medicine from the scene of the crime later?Gumshoe:\nUm, no. They didn't.Phoenix:\nThe victim was given a prescription right before going to Tr\u00e9s Bien. Where, then, did the medicine disappear to!?Gumshoe:\nY-You... ...are toooooo coool, pal!!Judge:\nI-Indeed! Due consideration wasn't given to the victim's prescription in the previous trial. Witness! Why do you always overlook such vital pieces of evidence!?Gumshoe:\nI, er... I guess that's the most careless thing I've done so far, huh?Phoenix:\nThe victim was killed by poison! And the victim's \"medicine\" mysteriously disappeared! The victim's own prescription could have been the lethal poison itself!Judge:\nO-Order! Order! Well, Mr. Godot? What do you have to say to that?Godot:\nHa...! That's all.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Godot:\nRead for the court the name of the clinic on the prescription bag, if you will.Phoenix:\nWhat's the clinic's name got to do with anything...? \"New Ear Otolaryngological Clinic\" O-Otolaryngological?Judge:\nJust what kind of illness was the victim suffering from, Mr. Godot?Godot:\nHardly an illness, Your Honor. More like a bitter war wound, you could say.Judge:\nA war wound?Godot:\nThe day before the incident, Mr. Elg found himself in a fight. He took a blow to the side of the head, and ruptured his eardrum.Phoenix:\nHe ruptured his eardrum!?Judge:\nThen what on earth was the prescription he was given?Godot:\nIt was a cream that was to be applied topically inside his ear canal, not to be ingested!Phoenix:\nWhat!?Godot:\nIt's mentioned in the autopsy report, if you read the fine print. They found traces of the medication in the victim's left ear.Judge:\nYes. Here it is. In very, very fine print.Godot:\nIt seems Mr. Elg correctly applied some of his medication while he was at Tr\u00e9s Bien. Therefore, it would be absurd to believe that he would have eaten his medication.Phoenix:\nUuurgh...Judge:\nIt seems that this medication is irrelevant to the case after all.Phoenix:\nN-No...Maya:\nNick! If you don't think of something quick, it'll all be over!Phoenix:\n(She's right. But I can't get away with any old weak objection. What should I do...?)Push the medication issue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Only moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement.\"Leave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt does seem as it the medication isn't connected to the case.\nGodot:\nHa...! Maybe the last Mr. Trite was the real one. At least he didn't waste time.\nJudge:\nIndeed... If you have nothing further to add to this medication issue... ...the facts of this case seem no different to those presented on the last trial. I would therefore have no choice but to hand down my verdict.\nPhoenix:\nUh... Umm...!\nMaya:\nNick! Don't let him to do this! You've got to stand your ground!\nJudge:\nNow then...\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWait, Your Honor! Actually, this prescription... is absolutely pivotal to the case!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Did you not just say the exact opposite only moments ago!?\nPhoenix:\n(Gotta lose a few battles in order to win the war, I suppose.)\nLeads to:\n\"Only moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement.\"Phoenix:\nOnly moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement. \"It seems Mr. Elg correctly applied some of his medication while he was at Tr\u00e9s Bien.\" If that's the case, then why was the medication not found at the scene of the crime!?Godot:\n...!Judge:\nBut the medication in question was for topical use inside the ear canal!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nThat doesn't change the fact that it could not be found at the crime scene! However insignificant it may seem, it's a lawyer's duty to pursue the truth!Godot:Godot:\nYou know as well as I do that the medication is irrelevant. It hardly seems likely that a prescription drug would contain potassium cyanide.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nIt hardly seems likely that the coffee the waitress served would contain it, either! But it did! The possibility is undeniable!Godot:\nAaargh!Judge:\nThat's enough. Mr. Godot. Is the detective the only witness the prosecution wishes to call?Godot:\n...Judge:\nMr. Godot...?Godot:\n...Gumshoe:\nUm... I, ah... I've got my own witness I'd like to call, sir. It's the old man who was there in the restaurant on the day of the murder.Phoenix:\n(Victor Kudo? The pigeon-hater?)Judge:\nVery well. The matter of the disappearing medication seems little more than trivial at best. However! It wasn't explored at all in the previous trial. And that is something that bothers me.Maya:\nYay! Good job, Nick!Judge:\nThe court will adjourn for a 10 minute recess. After which we will hear the prosecution's next witness.Godot:\nHa...! I suppose this means I'll just have to finish you off in my last 6 cups.Judge:\nCourt is adjourned for recess!January 7, 11:03 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Maya:\nPhew! That was close!Phoenix:\nTell me about it... I nearly died in there!Byrde:\nThat's my line, sir!Maya:\nNo! It's my line! I think I really did die a little bit.Byrde:\nLooks like we all nearly died in there... I can't believe Detective Gumshoe! How could he betray us like that!?Maya:\nHuh?Byrde:\nHe said he'd help me. But he totally set me up!Phoenix:\nI don't think he meant to do that, Maggey. He was backed into a corner. I mean, the guy's got to do his job, right?Byrde:\nIt's OK. I know all about lies and betrayal. I've had them my whole life. But it really hurt this time. It felt like someone punched me hard in the stomach! I hate that guy! I don't ever want to see him again!Phoenix:\n(Poor Gumshoe...)Maya:\nSo the next witness is going to be that old guy from the park, right?Phoenix:\nYeah. Mr. Kudo. Lover of waitress outfits and projectile seeds!Byrde:\nI bet he's gonna be really stubborn. I mean, he's pretty set in his ways, you know?Maya:\nYeah, he's a big old grouch. Are you going to be able to handle him, Nick?Phoenix:\nYeah, I can take whatever he throws at me. Even those never-ending bird seeds!January 7, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:\nCourt will now reconvene for the trial of Maggey Byrde. Mr. Godot. Your next witness, please.Godot:\nThe prosecution calls the lucky old-timer who caught the show over a cup of coffee. Will the witness please take the stand.Godot:\nName and occupation, if you don't mind.Kudo:\nThe name is Victor Kudo. Born and bred in the Land of the Rising Sun! Honor and duty are what make me. Mind you, I can be quite emotional at times, too.Phoenix:\nWe don't need to hear about that, Mr. Kudo. Just tell the court your occupation.Kudo:\nMy occupation? Kah! Listen, young'un! How much call d'you think there is for kimono embroidery here!?Phoenix:\nKimono embroidery?Kudo:\nThat's what I do! Or did, back in Japan. I embroidered family crests on kimonos! My ancestors were embroidering kimonos before this country even existed!Maya:\nWow, a real craftsman! They're a dying breed! Hey! Maybe he could embroider my costume sometime.Kudo:\nAnyway, like I said. There's not much demand for that kind of thing here. So I had to take a job working the cash register at a burger joint... pretending to smile!Phoenix:\n(That burger joint would've been better off putting him in the kitchen...)Judge:\nNow then, witness. Were you in the restaurant at the time of the incident?Kudo:\nOh, yes! I was eating some seeds over a cup of javaccino.Judge:\nSeeds?Kudo:\nWhat do you think these are, hmm!?Judge:\nI-I see...Godot:\nSo you saw everything that happened, gramps?Kudo:\nDid I!? Oh, yes! Oh, yes I did! I saw it all!Godot:\nThen please, tell the court. We're all ears.Kudo:\nSure, sure. I'll tell you. I'll tell you every last detail!Phoenix:\n(He's really getting into this...)Witness Testimony-- What I Witnessed --Kudo:\nThe young man was reading the sports paper.\nThe serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it!\nThe man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed.\nThat's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well!Judge:\nMr. Kudo. she is not a \"serving girl\". Please refer to her as a waitress.Kudo:\nKah! You're as bad as the rest of them! All these newfangled words! What's wrong with old-fashioned ones, hmm!?Judge:\nN-Newfangled?Kudo:\nAll this talk of \"radios\" and \"glasses\"! It's \"wireless\" and \"spectacles\", I tell you!Judge:\nE-Excuse me...Kudo:\nListen to me, everyone! Don't forget the old values! Don't let the good old days slip away!Judge:\nWell, um... I think it's time to begin the cross-examination, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor.Cross Examination",

D-Did I say something dumb again!?\nPhoenix:\nLet me paraphrase what you just testified to this court. \"The victim didn't have any form of ID on him.\" That's basically what you said, yes?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, basically.\nPhoenix:\nIn that case, how were you able to identify the victim so quickly?\nGumshoe:\n... Oh... That.\nPhoenix:\n(He's so let down, he's got the whole sagging shoulders and puppy eyes thing going...)\nGumshoe:\nThere was a prescription bag on the victim's table along with the lottery ticket.\nGodot:\nIt seems Mr. Glen Elg visited his doctor before he went to Tr\u00e9s Bien.\nGumshoe:\nWe got the victim's name from the medical records of the doc who prescribed the meds.\nJudge:\nHmm... That's a reliable enough source for the court.\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I leave this alone or ask to hear more?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I guess it doesn't really matter how they figured out who the victim was. There are more important avenues to explore.)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nAsk about the prescription bag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo what sort of medicine was in the bag?\nGumshoe:\nWell... Actually, the bag we found was empty.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. Completely empty.\nPhoenix:\n(It was completely empty...?)\nVictim's Prescription Bag added to the Court Record.\nGodot:\nHa...! You're entering an empty paper bag as evidence? Desperate, are you, Trite?\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nNow, what happened with the investigation after that, Detective?\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nAsk about his health insurance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, the victim had no form of identification on him, correct?\nGumshoe:\nYeah.\nPhoenix:\nAnd yet, before arriving at the restaurant, he went to see a doctor. Which means... He must've had his medical insurance card with him!\nJudge:\nOh! That is very true!\nPhoenix:\nThe fact that it hasn't been found points to only one obvious conclusion. The victim's medical card was stolen!\nGodot:\nHa...! True, the victim didn't have a medical insurance card. But why? Because Mr. Glen Elg didn't have medical insurance to begin with!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nJudge:\nHmm... As I thought, a thoroughly miserable young man.\nGodot:\nOr some kind of outlaw... A bit of an edge never hurt anyone.\nMaya:\nLooks like we're off course again, Nick.\nJudge:\nWitness. Please continue with your testimony. Explain for the court the events following the preliminary investigation.\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after Victim's Prescription Bag is added to the Court Record)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWait a sec!\nGumshoe:\nHuh? D-Did I say something dumb again!?\nPhoenix:\nLet me paraphrase what you just testified to this court. \"The victim didn't have any form of ID on him.\" That's basically what you said, yes?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, basically.\nPhoenix:\nIn that case, how were you able to identify the victim so quickly?\nGumshoe:\n... Oh... That.\nPhoenix:\n(He's so let down, he's got the whole sagging shoulders and puppy eyes thing going...)\nGumshoe:\nThere was a prescription bag on the victim's table along with the lottery ticket.\nGodot:\nIt seems Mr. Glen Elg visited his doctor before he went to Tr\u00e9s Bien.\nGumshoe:\nWe got the victim's name from the medical records of the doc who prescribed the meds.\nJudge:\nHmm... That's a reliable enough source for the court.Gumshoe:\nWhen Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBut the defendant had been passed out for a while, correct? In that case... Isn't it possible someone planted the evidence in Maggey's pocket!?\nGumshoe:\nHey! Y-Yeah! You've nailed it, pal!\nJudge:\nHmm...\nGumshoe:\nIt happens to me all the time! We had a department party the other day, and when I got home... ...I was wearing the boss's shoes!\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nKeep up this crazy testimony, Detective, and those shoes will end up down your throat!\nGumshoe:\nSorry...\nGodot:\nSo, Trite. \"Someone planted the evidence in Maggey's pocket\"...? That's a pretty bold statement. Care to back it up with some evidence?\nPhoenix:\nUm... Well... (I'd love to, if I had any...)\nJudge:\nIt appears you have no evidence to support your theory, Mr. Wright. Continue with your testimony, witness.Gumshoe:\nAnd that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo the half a million dollar lottery ticket and the bottle of poison were accounted for.\nGumshoe:\nYeah.\nPhoenix:\nInteresting... It's true that those two items are accounted for... ..but wasn't there another lottery ticket that was stolen that day?\nGumshoe:\nOh, yeah. The one the restaurant owner took. He won a whole dollar with it. What a lucky guy, huh?\nPhoenix:\n(And they're just going to let him get away with it...?)\nJudge:\nIt was just one dollar, Detective.\nMaya:\nI guess no one cares when it's that little... Unless it's Gumshoe.Present Victim's Prescription Bag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Detective Gumshoe. I think I should point something out to you.\"Phoenix:\nIf I don't find a hole in this testimony, the judge is going to hand down his verdict!Maya:\nGumshoe isn't giving us anything to work with... And we can't find any contradictions if he doesn't give us something!Phoenix:\nYeah, that's true... But Maggey and Gumshoe are like dumb and dumber. Our only hope is that they were so dumb, they missed something obvious.Maya:\nCome on, Gumshoe! Be the dumbest you've ever been!Phoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe. I think I should point something out to you. There is just one small contradiction in your testimony.Gumshoe:\nOho! Finally! I'm getting all anxious just waiting, so hurry up, will you?Phoenix:\nYou testified that, \"nothing else was missing from the crime scene.\" However! The prescription bag you mentioned was empty! Did the officers recover the medicine from the scene of the crime later?Gumshoe:\nUm, no. They didn't.Phoenix:\nThe victim was given a prescription right before going to Tr\u00e9s Bien. Where, then, did the medicine disappear to!?Gumshoe:\nY-You... ...are toooooo coool, pal!!Judge:\nI-Indeed! Due consideration wasn't given to the victim's prescription in the previous trial. Witness! Why do you always overlook such vital pieces of evidence!?Gumshoe:\nI, er... I guess that's the most careless thing I've done so far, huh?Phoenix:\nThe victim was killed by poison! And the victim's \"medicine\" mysteriously disappeared! The victim's own prescription could have been the lethal poison itself!Judge:\nO-Order! Order! Well, Mr. Godot? What do you have to say to that?Godot:\nHa...! That's all.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Godot:\nRead for the court the name of the clinic on the prescription bag, if you will.Phoenix:\nWhat's the clinic's name got to do with anything...? \"New Ear Otolaryngological Clinic\" O-Otolaryngological?Judge:\nJust what kind of illness was the victim suffering from, Mr. Godot?Godot:\nHardly an illness, Your Honor. More like a bitter war wound, you could say.Judge:\nA war wound?Godot:\nThe day before the incident, Mr. Elg found himself in a fight. He took a blow to the side of the head, and ruptured his eardrum.Phoenix:\nHe ruptured his eardrum!?Judge:\nThen what on earth was the prescription he was given?Godot:\nIt was a cream that was to be applied topically inside his ear canal, not to be ingested!Phoenix:\nWhat!?Godot:\nIt's mentioned in the autopsy report, if you read the fine print. They found traces of the medication in the victim's left ear.Judge:\nYes. Here it is. In very, very fine print.Godot:\nIt seems Mr. Elg correctly applied some of his medication while he was at Tr\u00e9s Bien. Therefore, it would be absurd to believe that he would have eaten his medication.Phoenix:\nUuurgh...Judge:\nIt seems that this medication is irrelevant to the case after all.Phoenix:\nN-No...Maya:\nNick! If you don't think of something quick, it'll all be over!Phoenix:\n(She's right. But I can't get away with any old weak objection. What should I do...?)Push the medication issue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Only moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement.\"Leave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt does seem as it the medication isn't connected to the case.\nGodot:\nHa...! Maybe the last Mr. Trite was the real one. At least he didn't waste time.\nJudge:\nIndeed... If you have nothing further to add to this medication issue... ...the facts of this case seem no different to those presented on the last trial. I would therefore have no choice but to hand down my verdict.\nPhoenix:\nUh... Umm...!\nMaya:\nNick! Don't let him to do this! You've got to stand your ground!\nJudge:\nNow then...\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWait, Your Honor! Actually, this prescription... is absolutely pivotal to the case!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Did you not just say the exact opposite only moments ago!?\nPhoenix:\n(Gotta lose a few battles in order to win the war, I suppose.)\nLeads to:\n\"Only moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement.\"Phoenix:\nOnly moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement. \"It seems Mr. Elg correctly applied some of his medication while he was at Tr\u00e9s Bien.\" If that's the case, then why was the medication not found at the scene of the crime!?Godot:\n...!Judge:\nBut the medication in question was for topical use inside the ear canal!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nThat doesn't change the fact that it could not be found at the crime scene! However insignificant it may seem, it's a lawyer's duty to pursue the truth!Godot:Godot:\nYou know as well as I do that the medication is irrelevant. It hardly seems likely that a prescription drug would contain potassium cyanide.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nIt hardly seems likely that the coffee the waitress served would contain it, either! But it did! The possibility is undeniable!Godot:\nAaargh!Judge:\nThat's enough. Mr. Godot. Is the detective the only witness the prosecution wishes to call?Godot:\n...Judge:\nMr. Godot...?Godot:\n...Gumshoe:\nUm... I, ah... I've got my own witness I'd like to call, sir. It's the old man who was there in the restaurant on the day of the murder.Phoenix:\n(Victor Kudo? The pigeon-hater?)Judge:\nVery well. The matter of the disappearing medication seems little more than trivial at best. However! It wasn't explored at all in the previous trial. And that is something that bothers me.Maya:\nYay! Good job, Nick!Judge:\nThe court will adjourn for a 10 minute recess. After which we will hear the prosecution's next witness.Godot:\nHa...! I suppose this means I'll just have to finish you off in my last 6 cups.Judge:\nCourt is adjourned for recess!January 7, 11:03 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Maya:\nPhew! That was close!Phoenix:\nTell me about it... I nearly died in there!Byrde:\nThat's my line, sir!Maya:\nNo! It's my line! I think I really did die a little bit.Byrde:\nLooks like we all nearly died in there... I can't believe Detective Gumshoe! How could he betray us like that!?Maya:\nHuh?Byrde:\nHe said he'd help me. But he totally set me up!Phoenix:\nI don't think he meant to do that, Maggey. He was backed into a corner. I mean, the guy's got to do his job, right?Byrde:\nIt's OK. I know all about lies and betrayal. I've had them my whole life. But it really hurt this time. It felt like someone punched me hard in the stomach! I hate that guy! I don't ever want to see him again!Phoenix:\n(Poor Gumshoe...)Maya:\nSo the next witness is going to be that old guy from the park, right?Phoenix:\nYeah. Mr. Kudo. Lover of waitress outfits and projectile seeds!Byrde:\nI bet he's gonna be really stubborn. I mean, he's pretty set in his ways, you know?Maya:\nYeah, he's a big old grouch. Are you going to be able to handle him, Nick?Phoenix:\nYeah, I can take whatever he throws at me. Even those never-ending bird seeds!January 7, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:\nCourt will now reconvene for the trial of Maggey Byrde. Mr. Godot. Your next witness, please.Godot:\nThe prosecution calls the lucky old-timer who caught the show over a cup of coffee. Will the witness please take the stand.Godot:\nName and occupation, if you don't mind.Kudo:\nThe name is Victor Kudo. Born and bred in the Land of the Rising Sun! Honor and duty are what make me. Mind you, I can be quite emotional at times, too.Phoenix:\nWe don't need to hear about that, Mr. Kudo. Just tell the court your occupation.Kudo:\nMy occupation? Kah! Listen, young'un! How much call d'you think there is for kimono embroidery here!?Phoenix:\nKimono embroidery?Kudo:\nThat's what I do! Or did, back in Japan. I embroidered family crests on kimonos! My ancestors were embroidering kimonos before this country even existed!Maya:\nWow, a real craftsman! They're a dying breed! Hey! Maybe he could embroider my costume sometime.Kudo:\nAnyway, like I said. There's not much demand for that kind of thing here. So I had to take a job working the cash register at a burger joint... pretending to smile!Phoenix:\n(That burger joint would've been better off putting him in the kitchen...)Judge:\nNow then, witness. Were you in the restaurant at the time of the incident?Kudo:\nOh, yes! I was eating some seeds over a cup of javaccino.Judge:\nSeeds?Kudo:\nWhat do you think these are, hmm!?Judge:\nI-I see...Godot:\nSo you saw everything that happened, gramps?Kudo:\nDid I!? Oh, yes! Oh, yes I did! I saw it all!Godot:\nThen please, tell the court. We're all ears.Kudo:\nSure, sure. I'll tell you. I'll tell you every last detail!Phoenix:\n(He's really getting into this...)Witness Testimony-- What I Witnessed --Kudo:\nThe young man was reading the sports paper.\nThe serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it!\nThe man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed.\nThat's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well!Judge:\nMr. Kudo. she is not a \"serving girl\". Please refer to her as a waitress.Kudo:\nKah! You're as bad as the rest of them! All these newfangled words! What's wrong with old-fashioned ones, hmm!?Judge:\nN-Newfangled?Kudo:\nAll this talk of \"radios\" and \"glasses\"! It's \"wireless\" and \"spectacles\", I tell you!Judge:\nE-Excuse me...Kudo:\nListen to me, everyone! Don't forget the old values! Don't let the good old days slip away!Judge:\nWell, um... I think it's time to begin the cross-examination, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor.Cross Examination",

I guess I should've expected this. Nobody saw the other guy, huh? But he was there when I took the coffee over, sir. Scout's honor!???:\nMaggey!Byrde:\nAck! D-Detective Gumshoe!Gumshoe:\nA-Are you doing alright!? How're you feeling!?Byrde:\n...As if you need to ask either question, sir.Gumshoe:\nDon't let 'em get you down, Maggey. And don't forget to eat well, OK?Byrde:\nRoger!Gumshoe:\nAnd you!Phoenix:\nY-Yes?Gumshoe:\nYou'd better square this case away, got it pal!? Maggey's innocent, you hear!? If you screw up, then I'll be doing some squaring away myself. Squaring away some paperwork for your arrest!Phoenix:\n(I-I think he's serious!)Maya:\nHey, Detective! You're on our side for once, right?Gumshoe:\nYup.Maya:\nSo you'll be able to help Maggey out, right?Byrde:\nReally? Can you, sir!?Gumshoe:\nO... Of course! I've got the simulation under control! I'm gonna be the first witness on the stand today. If something I say doesn't mesh with the facts, make sure you point it out, alright?Phoenix:\nS-Sure.Gumshoe:\nOK. We're forming a united front today, pal. You get me!?Byrde:\nI can't tell you how grateful I am, sir! I've always admired you so much, Detective. I know I can count on you.Maya:\nLooks like it should all go pretty smoothly today, huh?Phoenix:\n(I can only wish...)January 7, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Maggey Byrde.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Godot:\n... Aaah, bitter!Judge:\nMr... Um... Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor?Judge:\nAaaah!Phoenix:\nWh-What's wrong!?Judge:\nNothing. It's just whenever I addressed you in the previous trial, your response was... \"Youse talkin' to me!?\" It was a little, well... intimidating.Phoenix:\nNo, no! That wasn't me. That was the phony Phoenix.Judge:\nI see. So our trusty Phoenix Wright is back with us now, is he?Phoenix:\n(\"Our trusty\"...?)Judge:\nSo, Mr. Godot. Your opening statement, please.Godot:\nMr. Trite... Whether you're a fake or the real deal... We will find out soon enough through this trial today.Phoenix:\nBut I can already tell you! I'm the real Phoenix Wright!Godot:\nI wasn't questioning whether you are Phoenix Wright or not. I was questioning whether you had studied law or not. That's what I intend to find out.Phoenix:\n(There's no denying it. Behind that mask is a man who really hates me for some reason or another!)Judge:\nAs everyone is aware, the court has already given its verdict on this case once. Therefore, I won't stand for irrelevant testimony during this retrial. Nor will I stand for a simple repetition of the evidence presented in the last trial.Phoenix:\n(I'm not planning on repeating anything that phony me said! Trust me!)Judge:\nNow then. Mr. Godot, please summon your first witness.Godot:\nLet's start with the formalities, shall we? Name and occupation?Gumshoe:\n...Judge:\nWitness! State your name for the court!Gumshoe:\nHuh? Oh, sorry, sir! The name's Police Department Detective. Occupation, Dick Gumshoe.Godot:\nOther way around, Detective.Gumshoe:\nHuh? Oh! Sorry. Anyway, I'm the officer in charge of this case since yesterday. Sir!Judge:\nSince yesterday?Gumshoe:\nYeah. The guy who was on the initial investigation's tied up with another case now.Maya:\nI hope Gumshoe's really got everything under control... For everyone's sake.Judge:\nI see. So, Detective Gumshoe... Would you outline for the court the basic facts of the case?Gumshoe:\nY-Y-Yes, sir. The victim's name was Glen Elg. He was a professional programmer. He was on the payroll of Blue Screens Inc., a local company. This is the victim's autopsy report.Judge:\nThe court accepts this into evidence.Glen's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.Gumshoe:\nUm... And here are the floor plans of the restaurant. When the incident took place, the victim was sitting right here. The poisoned coffee was brought over to him by the, um... By the waitress.Judge:\nThe waitress being the accused?Gumshoe:\nYeah... The victim died from poisoning almost immediately after he took a sip of the coffee. At the time of the incident, there were two other people in the restaurant. Mr. Jean Armstrong, the owner and chef. And a regular by the name of Mr. Victor Kudo.Judge:\nHmm... It still seems to be a very straightforward case to me.Tr\u00e9s Bien Floor Plans added to the Court Record.Godot:\nCome, Detective. Take up this hammer. And nail the defendant's coffin shut with your own two hands.Judge:\nNow then, Detective Gumshoe. Let's have your testimony.Gumshoe:\nUmm... Yes, sir...Witness Testimony-- The Incident --Gumshoe:\nWhen the incident took place, the victim was alone at his table, sir.\nWe understand that the guy, Glen Elg, was listening to the radio at the time.\nTraces of poison were found in his coffee cup.\nAnd what we found was potassium cyanide. That stuff really packs a punch!\nAnd, um... it looks like Ms. Byrde might've had, well... some kind of a motive.Judge:\nHmm...Godot:\nUsing the dark, aromatic depths of coffee to conceal the poison... Classy lady!Judge:\nThe facts of this case seem to be ironclad. Mr. Wright. I would ask you to begin your cross-examination, but...Phoenix:\nYes?Judge:\nPlease, no intimidation tricks this time around. Is that understood?Phoenix:\nI already told you! That wasn't me!Cross Examination-- The Incident --Gumshoe:\nWhen the incident took place, the victim was alone at his table, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nCan I stop you for just a minute?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? What is it? Did I say something that contradicts the evidence?\nPhoenix:\n(He'd so desperate for that to be true, he's practically crying!) Your testimony just now doesn't match the testimony given by Ms. Byrde. She claims that there was another man at the victim's table.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's what she said. And I--\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nWhat killer wouldn't say that when faced with a homicide conviction?\nPhoenix:\nHey!\nGodot:\nSadly, her testimony isn't supported by the owner or the other customer. Isn't that right, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, it's true. Their two testimonies tie up on that. They both said there was no other guy at the table.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.)\nMaya:\nIf you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad.\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, maybe the other witnesses just missed him! Perhaps their view of the victim's table was obscured in some way.\nGodot:\nHa...! That argument is as weak as the coffee at Tr\u00e9s Bien, Trite!\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nI have here in my possession a ticket.\nPhoenix:\nA ticket? (Looks more like a photo to me.)\nGodot:\nYes. A one-way ticket to guilty-ville! Population: the defendant! This is a photograph taken from near the entrance to the kitchen.\nJudge:\nThis is the scene as witnessed by the chef, moments after the poisoning took place, correct?\nGodot:\nI think the court will agree that with such a clear view of the scene of the crime... ...how, Mr. Trite, could anyone have overlooked a second person at the table?\nPhoenix:\nUrk!\nJudge:\nIt certainly seems to show the victim's table extremely clearly.\nCrime Photo added to the Court Record.\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after Crime Photo is added to the Court Record)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nCan I stop you for just a minute?\nGumshoe:\nHuh?

He had a portable radio in his chest pocket.\nMaya:\nMaggey told us that too, didn't she? Something about how \"one of them had some sort of earpiece\".\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.)\nMaya:\nIf you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad.\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd what was it that the victim was listening to on the radio, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? How should I know?\nPhoenix:\n(Thanks a lot... We're now one step closer to the middle of nowhere.)\nMaya:\nThis isn't going very well, is it...?\nJudge:\nHmm... Detective. Could you perhaps tell us about the poison and how it was used?\nLeads back to cross-examinationGumshoe:\nTraces of poison were found in his coffee cup.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, traces of the poison were found in the coffee cup and nowhere else?\nGumshoe:\nNot sure I get you, pal.\nPhoenix:\nWas the poison a liquid? Or was it a powder?\nGumshoe:\nIf I had to put it in layman's terms, I'd say it was a powdery substance.\nPhoenix:\nSo the poison could've been in anything that was on the table. Sugar, salt, pepper...\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHa...! Do you put salt and pepper in your coffee, Trite?\nGumshoe:\nThe victim took his coffee black, with no sugar.\nPhoenix:\nNngh...\nJudge:\nIt seems that the poison could only have been in the coffee.\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.)\nMaya:\nIf you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad.\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely certain that the victim even drank any of his coffee?\nGumshoe:\nHuh!? What do you mean?\nPhoenix:\nAccording to this file, \"the poison was found in the victim's coffee cup.\" But what proof is there that the victim ever drank any of it!?\nGumshoe:\nOh, hey! You're right! That's what I was think--\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nIn case you were wondering, that last objection was for the detective there.\nGumshoe:\nHuh? For me?\nGodot:\n\"Oh, hey! You're right!\"? You may be fooling the court, but I'm not falling for it. If you have the time to waste, you have the time to present that piece of evidence.\nGumshoe:\nTh... THAT piece... sir?\nGodot:\nYes. THAT piece.\nGumshoe:\n... Um... Aheh heh heh! Wh-What piece was it again?\nGodot:\nThis!\nPhoenix:\n(Should I be grateful this coffee's only hot enough to give me 1st degree burns...?)\nGumshoe:\nOh. Now I remember! Um... This is the, uh... victim's coffee cup.\nGodot:\nYes, the victim's cup. Take a good look at the rim.\nJudge:\nOh, yes. It's unmistakable. There is clearly a coffee stain on it.\nGodot:\nConclusive proof that the victim did drink the poisoned coffee that was in this cup. The victim gulped down the bitter death that the waitress brought to him... like this!\nPhoenix:\nUuuurgh!\nGumshoe:\nFor the record, the only prints on the cup were the victim's and the defendant's.\nCoffee Cup added to the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\nUpon further investigation of this cup... we found a certain chemical substance...\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after Coffee Cup is added to the Court Record)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, traces of the poison were found in the coffee cup and nowhere else?\nGumshoe:\nNot sure I get you, pal.\nPhoenix:\nWas the poison a liquid?

That stuff really packs a punch!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n(Potassium cyanide? I've heard of that chemical before...) Exactly how strong is this poison, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nIt's... Well... That stuff's lethal! Eat too much, and you're history.\nMaya:\nHow much is too much?\nGodot:\nA lethal dose is 0.2 grams. That's about enough to finish anyone off.\nMaya:\n0.2 grams? How much is that?\nGumshoe:\nYou know when you swab your ears for earwax? Yeah, about that much.\nPhoenix:\n(Earwax, huh? Sounds like something Gumshoe's got an abundance of...)\nJudge:\nHmm... Such a small quantity of poison could have been concealed anywhere.Gumshoe:\nAnd, um... it looks like Ms. Byrde might've had, well... some kind of a motive.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Some kind of a motive\"?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. But if you ask me, it's been blown way out of proportion.\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nYou know what my golden rule is, Detective? Chuck out a bad cup of coffee. You can always get another.\nGumshoe:\nHuh? I don't get it.\nGodot:\nI'm saying, we can always get another witness on the stand, if we have to chuck you out.\nGumshoe:\n*gulp*\nGodot:\nSo stick to the facts, Detective. Now then, what was Ms. Byrde's motive?\nPhoenix:\n(Come on, Gumshoe...)\nGumshoe:\nShe was... They said she wanted to steal a lottery ticket.\nPhoenix:\nI knew it... (That's what we heard yesterday, too.)\nGumshoe:\nIt disappeared from the scene of the crime.\nGodot:\nAnd it wasn't just any lottery ticket. It was a winning ticket for half a million!\nMaya:\nMr. Armstrong knew about the ticket too, didn't he? But he stole the wrong one...\nPhoenix:\n(Then is it possible Maggey stole the winning one? What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.)\nMaya:\nIf you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad.\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWait a minute! The mere fact that the lottery ticket disappeared in no way implicates my client!\nGodot:\nHa...! I have here in my hand... the very ticket in question!\nJudge:\nTh-That's the half a million dollar lottery ticket...?\nGumshoe:\nOne of the female police officers found it when she was conducting a search... ...of the defendant.\nPhoenix:\nWH-WHAAAAAT!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order!\nGodot:\nHa...! She's quite a lucky bird, our little waitress.\nJudge:\nY-You will submit that ticket as evidence to the court! Immediately!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, I'd better keep an eye on that ticket. The way the judge's voice is quivering...)\nVictim's Lottery Ticket added to the Court Record.\nJudge:\nThe ticket was presented to the court in the previous trial, too. But it feels heavier now somehow. H-Half a million dollars, you say...?\nGodot:\nIt's just a scrap of paper. What matters is where it was found, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\n(And that's on Maggey's person, unfortunately...) (Changed from [I bet he wants to say it was found on Maggey's person...] in the original release)\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after Victim's Lottery Ticket is added to the Court Record)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Some kind of a motive\"?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. But if you ask me, it's been blown way out of proportion.\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nYou know what my golden rule is, Detective? Chuck out a bad cup of coffee. You can always get another.\nGumshoe:\nHuh? I don't get it.\nGodot:\nI'm saying, we can always get another witness on the stand, if we have to chuck you out.\nGumshoe:\n*gulp*\nGodot:\nSo stick to the facts, Detective.

It was a winning ticket for half a million!\nMaya:\nMr. Armstrong knew about the ticket too, didn't he? But he stole the wrong one...\nPhoenix:\n(Then is it possible Maggey stole the winning one?)Maya:\nYou really think there are any contradictions in this testimony?Phoenix:\nTo be honest, I don't know.Maya:\nBut Gumshoe told us out in the lobby. He said we'd be forming a united front, right? How will we win the case if he doesn't throw us a line?Phoenix:\n(I don't have a whole lot of options right now... The best I can do is gather the facts together, I guess.)After selecting \"Press harder\" upon pressing first, third, and fifth statements:Judge:\nThat's enough! The facts of this case seem overwhelmingly clear to me. The defendant had ample opportunity to commit the crime of which she is charged. Furthermore, it seems beyond reasonable doubt that she did indeed commit this crime.Godot:\nI like an old man who knows the score.Judge:\nThere is also the matter of the half a million dollar lottery ticket. That alone provides a very credible motive. I mean, for that sum of money even I might be tempted to bend the rules!Godot:\nI don't mind an old man who is weak to the siren call of money.Maya:\nNot good, Nick... The evidence against Maggey is starting to pile up fast.Phoenix:\nYeah, that's because the court has ruled guilty once already.Godot:\nI'd say it's about time to wrap up this repeat performance... ...with one final, decisive piece of evidence.Phoenix:\n(He's got more evidence against Maggey!?)Godot:\nThis is the apron the delightful Ms. Byrde was wearing at the time.Maya:\nWow... That's not the cleanest apron I've seen...Phoenix:\nTh-That stain looks like...! (It can't be... blood, can it!?)Godot:\nHa...! It seems the star of our play was a little flustered... And somehow spilled coffee on herself.Phoenix:\nThe coffee!? That's not exactly the first thing that caught my eye...Godot:\nOf course. The coffee stain isn't the most interesting thing about this apron. No, there's something else that stands out even more.Judge:\nSomething else? I presume you mean...Godot:\nOf course. I'm referring to the pocket.Phoenix:\nThe... pocket?Godot:\nA search carried out right after the incident uncovered this... Potassium cyanide. The very poison used by the killer, was in her apron pocket!Phoenix:\nA bottle of poison... In Maggey's pocket?Gumshoe:\nYeah. And Maggey's prints were the only ones on it.Phoenix:\nWHAAAT!?Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! The court will accept these items into evidence.Apron added to the Court Record.Potassium Cyanide added to the Court Record.Judge:\nThere's something still bothering me, Mr. Godot. Why have you not explained the bloodstain to the court?Godot:\nBloodstain? What bloodstain would that be?Judge:\nDon't play games, prosecutor! The blood-colored stain that's smeared all over the apron!Godot:\nThat's ridiculous! No one told me anything about a bloodstain!Phoenix:\n(You don't need to be told! Just look at it!)Godot:\nWell, Detective!? Could this stain really be... BLOOD!?Gumshoe:\nN-No way, sir! That's... It's just ketchup. Sir.Phoenix:\nKetchup!?Gumshoe:\nShe must've gotten some on her an apron while taking someone their breakfast that day.Judge:\n... You could have spoken up a little sooner, Detective Gumshoe!Godot:\nPull a stunt like that again, and I'll have you drink 17 cups of ketchup, witness!Gumshoe:\nUnnngh... I thought everyone knew what it was already.Judge:\nHmm... I haven't seen anything yet to make me doubt the last verdict I ruled on this case.Phoenix:\n...!Judge:\nThe motive, the opportunity, and the supporting evidence... They have all been clearly established.Godot:\nWell, Trite... It seems you really are a phony after all.Phoenix:\n(Argh! You really know how to drive a man nuts!)Judge:\nWitness, please continue with your testimony. Describe for the court the crime scene and the findings of your investigation there.Witness Testimony-- The Investigation --Gumshoe:\nThe crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.\nPoor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her.\nThe victim didn't have any identification on him.\nBut we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly.\nWhen Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison.\nAnd that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene.Judge:\nHmm... You identified the victim and secured your prime suspect... Very good.Godot:\nLast chance to convince the court you're a real lawyer, Trite!Phoenix:\n...!Godot:\nDon't court on any more cross-examinations after this one! So, let the fun begin!Cross Examination-- The Investigation --Gumshoe:\nThe crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Scary old man\", Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nThere's an old man who's a regular at the restaurant where the incident happened.\nPhoenix:\n(Ah, we're obviously talking about the same old man...)\nGumshoe:\nOfficers were dispatched right after the report came in, but the old guy still made a fuss. \"What took you so long!?\" Then he hurled abuse at them. And seeds...\nJudge:\nHmm... Seeds...\nGodot:\nHa...! It was nothing! I caught each one with my teeth.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess not even the mighty Godot can avoid being attacked by that guy...)\nGodot:\nThe old man was only other customer in the place at the time. He took his time finding a pay phone apparently, so he was late reporting the crime.Gumshoe:\nPoor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow long was the defendant unconscious for?\nGumshoe:\nThe officers got to the crime scene at around 2:40. Maggey was still out cold in the kitchen at that time. It took another 10 minutes or so before she came to. I woulda liked to have been on the scene myself.\nPhoenix:\n(I bet you would've liked to have carried out the search, too...)\nGumshoe:\nI woulda loved to see Maggey asleep like that, all pretty and peaceful.\nPhoenix:\n(You're a professional detective, Gumshoe. Not a professional bird watcher!)\nGodot:\nSave the romantics for your own time, Detective. All we need to know about is the investigation.\nGumshoe:\nOops! I guess I'm pretty red right now, aren't I?Gumshoe:\nThe victim didn't have any identification on him.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe didn't have any? Are you saying that it was stolen, then?\nGumshoe:\nNo, I don't think so. The victim didn't have a driver's license or even a credit card on him, pal. All he had was 58 cents in his wallet.\nPhoenix:\nFifty-eight cents...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. I can't believe I found someone with less in their wallet than me, pal!\nJudge:\nThe victim sounds like he was a thoroughly miserable young man.\nGodot:\nOr some kind of outlaw... Why not give him a bit of an edge?\nPhoenix:\n(I think I'm on to something here...)Gumshoe:\nBut we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWait a sec!\nGumshoe:\nHuh? D-Did I say something dumb again!?\nPhoenix:\nLet me paraphrase what you just testified to this court. \"The victim didn't have any form of ID on him.\" That's basically what you said, yes?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, basically.\nPhoenix:\nIn that case, how were you able to identify the victim so quickly?\nGumshoe:\n... Oh... That.\nPhoenix:\n(He's so let down, he's got the whole sagging shoulders and puppy eyes thing going...)\nGumshoe:\nThere was a prescription bag on the victim's table along with the lottery ticket.\nGodot:\nIt seems Mr. Glen Elg visited his doctor before he went to Tr\u00e9s Bien.\nGumshoe:\nWe got the victim's name from the medical records of the doc who prescribed the meds.\nJudge:\nHmm... That's a reliable enough source for the court.\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I leave this alone or ask to hear more?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I guess it doesn't really matter how they figured out who the victim was. There are more important avenues to explore.)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nAsk about the prescription bag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo what sort of medicine was in the bag?\nGumshoe:\nWell... Actually, the bag we found was empty.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. Completely empty.\nPhoenix:\n(It was completely empty...?)\nVictim's Prescription Bag added to the Court Record.\nGodot:\nHa...! You're entering an empty paper bag as evidence? Desperate, are you, Trite?\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nNow, what happened with the investigation after that, Detective?\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nAsk about his health insurance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, the victim had no form of identification on him, correct?\nGumshoe:\nYeah.\nPhoenix:\nAnd yet, before arriving at the restaurant, he went to see a doctor. Which means... He must've had his medical insurance card with him!\nJudge:\nOh! That is very true!\nPhoenix:\nThe fact that it hasn't been found points to only one obvious conclusion. The victim's medical card was stolen!\nGodot:\nHa...! True, the victim didn't have a medical insurance card. But why? Because Mr. Glen Elg didn't have medical insurance to begin with!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nJudge:\nHmm... As I thought, a thoroughly miserable young man.\nGodot:\nOr some kind of outlaw... A bit of an edge never hurt anyone.\nMaya:\nLooks like we're off course again, Nick.\nJudge:\nWitness. Please continue with your testimony. Explain for the court the events following the preliminary investigation.\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after Victim's Prescription Bag is added to the Court Record)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWait a sec!\nGumshoe:\nHuh? D-Did I say something dumb again!?\nPhoenix:\nLet me paraphrase what you just testified to this court. \"The victim didn't have any form of ID on him.\" That's basically what you said, yes?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, basically.\nPhoenix:\nIn that case, how were you able to identify the victim so quickly?\nGumshoe:\n... Oh... That.\nPhoenix:\n(He's so let down, he's got the whole sagging shoulders and puppy eyes thing going...)\nGumshoe:\nThere was a prescription bag on the victim's table along with the lottery ticket.\nGodot:\nIt seems Mr. Glen Elg visited his doctor before he went to Tr\u00e9s Bien.\nGumshoe:\nWe got the victim's name from the medical records of the doc who prescribed the meds.\nJudge:\nHmm... That's a reliable enough source for the court.Gumshoe:\nWhen Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBut the defendant had been passed out for a while, correct? In that case... Isn't it possible someone planted the evidence in Maggey's pocket!?\nGumshoe:\nHey! Y-Yeah! You've nailed it, pal!\nJudge:\nHmm...\nGumshoe:\nIt happens to me all the time! We had a department party the other day, and when I got home... ...I was wearing the boss's shoes!\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nKeep up this crazy testimony, Detective, and those shoes will end up down your throat!\nGumshoe:\nSorry...\nGodot:\nSo, Trite. \"Someone planted the evidence in Maggey's pocket\"...? That's a pretty bold statement. Care to back it up with some evidence?\nPhoenix:\nUm... Well... (I'd love to, if I had any...)\nJudge:\nIt appears you have no evidence to support your theory, Mr. Wright. Continue with your testimony, witness.Gumshoe:\nAnd that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo the half a million dollar lottery ticket and the bottle of poison were accounted for.\nGumshoe:\nYeah.\nPhoenix:\nInteresting... It's true that those two items are accounted for... ..but wasn't there another lottery ticket that was stolen that day?\nGumshoe:\nOh, yeah. The one the restaurant owner took. He won a whole dollar with it. What a lucky guy, huh?\nPhoenix:\n(And they're just going to let him get away with it...?)\nJudge:\nIt was just one dollar, Detective.\nMaya:\nI guess no one cares when it's that little... Unless it's Gumshoe.Present Victim's Prescription Bag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Detective Gumshoe. I think I should point something out to you.\"Phoenix:\nIf I don't find a hole in this testimony, the judge is going to hand down his verdict!Maya:\nGumshoe isn't giving us anything to work with... And we can't find any contradictions if he doesn't give us something!Phoenix:\nYeah, that's true... But Maggey and Gumshoe are like dumb and dumber. Our only hope is that they were so dumb, they missed something obvious.Maya:\nCome on, Gumshoe! Be the dumbest you've ever been!Phoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe. I think I should point something out to you. There is just one small contradiction in your testimony.Gumshoe:\nOho! Finally! I'm getting all anxious just waiting, so hurry up, will you?Phoenix:\nYou testified that, \"nothing else was missing from the crime scene.\" However! The prescription bag you mentioned was empty! Did the officers recover the medicine from the scene of the crime later?Gumshoe:\nUm, no. They didn't.Phoenix:\nThe victim was given a prescription right before going to Tr\u00e9s Bien. Where, then, did the medicine disappear to!?Gumshoe:\nY-You... ...are toooooo coool, pal!!Judge:\nI-Indeed! Due consideration wasn't given to the victim's prescription in the previous trial. Witness! Why do you always overlook such vital pieces of evidence!?Gumshoe:\nI, er... I guess that's the most careless thing I've done so far, huh?Phoenix:\nThe victim was killed by poison! And the victim's \"medicine\" mysteriously disappeared! The victim's own prescription could have been the lethal poison itself!Judge:\nO-Order! Order! Well, Mr. Godot? What do you have to say to that?Godot:\nHa...! That's all.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Godot:\nRead for the court the name of the clinic on the prescription bag, if you will.Phoenix:\nWhat's the clinic's name got to do with anything...? \"New Ear Otolaryngological Clinic\" O-Otolaryngological?Judge:\nJust what kind of illness was the victim suffering from, Mr. Godot?Godot:\nHardly an illness, Your Honor. More like a bitter war wound, you could say.Judge:\nA war wound?Godot:\nThe day before the incident, Mr. Elg found himself in a fight. He took a blow to the side of the head, and ruptured his eardrum.Phoenix:\nHe ruptured his eardrum!?Judge:\nThen what on earth was the prescription he was given?Godot:\nIt was a cream that was to be applied topically inside his ear canal, not to be ingested!Phoenix:\nWhat!?Godot:\nIt's mentioned in the autopsy report, if you read the fine print. They found traces of the medication in the victim's left ear.Judge:\nYes. Here it is. In very, very fine print.Godot:\nIt seems Mr. Elg correctly applied some of his medication while he was at Tr\u00e9s Bien. Therefore, it would be absurd to believe that he would have eaten his medication.Phoenix:\nUuurgh...Judge:\nIt seems that this medication is irrelevant to the case after all.Phoenix:\nN-No...Maya:\nNick! If you don't think of something quick, it'll all be over!Phoenix:\n(She's right. But I can't get away with any old weak objection. What should I do...?)Push the medication issue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Only moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement.\"Leave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt does seem as it the medication isn't connected to the case.\nGodot:\nHa...! Maybe the last Mr. Trite was the real one. At least he didn't waste time.\nJudge:\nIndeed... If you have nothing further to add to this medication issue... ...the facts of this case seem no different to those presented on the last trial. I would therefore have no choice but to hand down my verdict.\nPhoenix:\nUh... Umm...!\nMaya:\nNick! Don't let him to do this! You've got to stand your ground!\nJudge:\nNow then...\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWait, Your Honor! Actually, this prescription... is absolutely pivotal to the case!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Did you not just say the exact opposite only moments ago!?\nPhoenix:\n(Gotta lose a few battles in order to win the war, I suppose.)\nLeads to:\n\"Only moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement.\"Phoenix:\nOnly moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement. \"It seems Mr. Elg correctly applied some of his medication while he was at Tr\u00e9s Bien.\" If that's the case, then why was the medication not found at the scene of the crime!?Godot:\n...!Judge:\nBut the medication in question was for topical use inside the ear canal!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nThat doesn't change the fact that it could not be found at the crime scene! However insignificant it may seem, it's a lawyer's duty to pursue the truth!Godot:Godot:\nYou know as well as I do that the medication is irrelevant. It hardly seems likely that a prescription drug would contain potassium cyanide.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nIt hardly seems likely that the coffee the waitress served would contain it, either! But it did! The possibility is undeniable!Godot:\nAaargh!Judge:\nThat's enough. Mr. Godot. Is the detective the only witness the prosecution wishes to call?Godot:\n...Judge:\nMr. Godot...?Godot:\n...Gumshoe:\nUm... I, ah... I've got my own witness I'd like to call, sir. It's the old man who was there in the restaurant on the day of the murder.Phoenix:\n(Victor Kudo? The pigeon-hater?)Judge:\nVery well. The matter of the disappearing medication seems little more than trivial at best. However! It wasn't explored at all in the previous trial. And that is something that bothers me.Maya:\nYay! Good job, Nick!Judge:\nThe court will adjourn for a 10 minute recess. After which we will hear the prosecution's next witness.Godot:\nHa...! I suppose this means I'll just have to finish you off in my last 6 cups.Judge:\nCourt is adjourned for recess!January 7, 11:03 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Maya:\nPhew! That was close!Phoenix:\nTell me about it... I nearly died in there!Byrde:\nThat's my line, sir!Maya:\nNo! It's my line! I think I really did die a little bit.Byrde:\nLooks like we all nearly died in there... I can't believe Detective Gumshoe! How could he betray us like that!?Maya:\nHuh?Byrde:\nHe said he'd help me. But he totally set me up!Phoenix:\nI don't think he meant to do that, Maggey. He was backed into a corner. I mean, the guy's got to do his job, right?Byrde:\nIt's OK. I know all about lies and betrayal. I've had them my whole life. But it really hurt this time. It felt like someone punched me hard in the stomach! I hate that guy! I don't ever want to see him again!Phoenix:\n(Poor Gumshoe...)Maya:\nSo the next witness is going to be that old guy from the park, right?Phoenix:\nYeah. Mr. Kudo. Lover of waitress outfits and projectile seeds!Byrde:\nI bet he's gonna be really stubborn. I mean, he's pretty set in his ways, you know?Maya:\nYeah, he's a big old grouch. Are you going to be able to handle him, Nick?Phoenix:\nYeah, I can take whatever he throws at me. Even those never-ending bird seeds!January 7, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:\nCourt will now reconvene for the trial of Maggey Byrde. Mr. Godot. Your next witness, please.Godot:\nThe prosecution calls the lucky old-timer who caught the show over a cup of coffee. Will the witness please take the stand.Godot:\nName and occupation, if you don't mind.Kudo:\nThe name is Victor Kudo. Born and bred in the Land of the Rising Sun! Honor and duty are what make me. Mind you, I can be quite emotional at times, too.Phoenix:\nWe don't need to hear about that, Mr. Kudo. Just tell the court your occupation.Kudo:\nMy occupation? Kah! Listen, young'un! How much call d'you think there is for kimono embroidery here!?Phoenix:\nKimono embroidery?Kudo:\nThat's what I do! Or did, back in Japan. I embroidered family crests on kimonos! My ancestors were embroidering kimonos before this country even existed!Maya:\nWow, a real craftsman! They're a dying breed! Hey! Maybe he could embroider my costume sometime.Kudo:\nAnyway, like I said. There's not much demand for that kind of thing here. So I had to take a job working the cash register at a burger joint... pretending to smile!Phoenix:\n(That burger joint would've been better off putting him in the kitchen...)Judge:\nNow then, witness. Were you in the restaurant at the time of the incident?Kudo:\nOh, yes! I was eating some seeds over a cup of javaccino.Judge:\nSeeds?Kudo:\nWhat do you think these are, hmm!?Judge:\nI-I see...Godot:\nSo you saw everything that happened, gramps?Kudo:\nDid I!? Oh, yes! Oh, yes I did! I saw it all!Godot:\nThen please, tell the court. We're all ears.Kudo:\nSure, sure. I'll tell you. I'll tell you every last detail!Phoenix:\n(He's really getting into this...)Witness Testimony-- What I Witnessed --Kudo:\nThe young man was reading the sports paper.\nThe serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it!\nThe man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed.\nThat's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well!Judge:\nMr. Kudo. she is not a \"serving girl\". Please refer to her as a waitress.Kudo:\nKah! You're as bad as the rest of them! All these newfangled words! What's wrong with old-fashioned ones, hmm!?Judge:\nN-Newfangled?Kudo:\nAll this talk of \"radios\" and \"glasses\"! It's \"wireless\" and \"spectacles\", I tell you!Judge:\nE-Excuse me...Kudo:\nListen to me, everyone! Don't forget the old values! Don't let the good old days slip away!Judge:\nWell, um... I think it's time to begin the cross-examination, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor.Cross Examination-- What I Witnessed --Kudo:\nThe young man was reading the sports paper.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you saw the victim, then? You saw Mr. Glen Elg?\nKudo:\nI wanted to know if Gusten Brawn retained his championship or not.\nPhoenix:\n(So he was looking at the sports paper the victim was reading, huh...) And at the location in question... ...there are partitions between tables on the same side of the restaurant, right?\nKudo:\nSo what if there are?\nPhoenix:\nIf you say that you could see the victim... ...that means you were sitting at a table on the other side of the restaurant, correct?\nKudo:\nKah! I go to that place to drink javaccino! I don't go to sit! I don't remember what table I was sitting at!\nPhoenix:\n(You mean you go there to eye the waitress!)Kudo:\nThe serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. Kudo. That is a very grave accusation. Are you sure about what you saw?\nKudo:\nVictor Kudo never makes mistakes! I dot every t and cross every i!\nPhoenix:\nI see...\nKudo:\nMy eyesight's fine. The doctor said I only need spectacles for reading and driving.\nPhoenix:\n(...I bet his eyes are only really \"fine\" when he's scoping out a waitress.)\nKudo:\nAnd I saw what the serving girl put into the javaccino as well!\nPhoenix:\n(I bet I know what's coming up and something tells me I'm not going to like it...)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(It'd be dangerous to press this too much. I'd better ignore it for now.) So, what happened next?\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor. We need more clarification on what was put into the victim's coffee. I'd like to ask that the witness add what he knows about this to his testimony.\nJudge:\nHmm... I agree. Witness, will you enlighten us, please?\nKudo:\nSure, sure.\nAdds statement \"There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there.\"Press (after adding statement \"There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there.\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. Kudo. That is a very grave accusation. Are you sure about what you saw?\nKudo:\nVictor Kudo never makes mistakes! I dot every t and cross every i!\nPhoenix:\nI see...\nKudo:\nMy eyesight's fine. The doctor said I only need spectacles for reading and driving.\nPhoenix:\n(...I bet his eyes are only really \"fine\" when he's scoping out a waitress.)\nKudo:\nAnd I saw what the serving girl put into the javaccino as well!Kudo:\nThere's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nD-Did she really put that into the coffee?\nKudo:\nYou doubt me, boy!? She too some out of a small, brown bottle and sprinkled it in.\nPhoenix:\nCouldn't she have been adding sugar?\nKudo:\nSugar!? In a small, brown bottle like that!?\nJudge:\n\"Like that\"? Witness, could you please describe the bottle in more concrete terms?\nGodot:\nHa...! A bottle like this, perhaps?\nKudo:\nOh, there it is! That's the one!\nJudge:\nThat's the bottle of potassium cyanide, I presume?\nGodot:\nSo what did the accused put into the coffee? I think it's clear, don't you?\nPhoenix:\nArgh...Kudo:\nThe man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe took just one sip?\nKudo:\nYou young'uns! You waste everything! Those javaccinos cost 8 dollars! In the good old days, we would have drank every last drop, eaten the cup, and then died!\nPhoenix:\n(Congratulations. You have earned the title of Battiest Man To Grace A Courtroom.)\nGodot:\nSo it was an immediate death? Well, with potassium cyanide, I suppose that is possible.\nKudo:\nOh, yes. He slumped over without so much as a twitch! I felt the javaccino I'd just drank turn sour in my stomach.\nGodot:\nOh, yes. I know that feeling.\nJudge:\nAnd the waitress? I presume she is...?Kudo:\nThat's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou said, \"I remember her well\" in reference to the waitress... Did she have any particular features that you can identify her by?\nKudo:\nParticular features!? It's a disgrace, that's what it is!\nPhoenix:\nSorry?\nKudo:\nYou can see all the way up to her... her... You know! She's practically naked in that uniform!\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo the particular feature you recognize about the waitress is... her outfit!? But anyone could wear just such an [sic] uniform! Even me!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Please spare the court of any further mental anguish from that image.\nMaya:\nDon't get all excited, Nick! You've gotta keep yourself together!\nPhoenix:\n(I-I guess I got a bit carried away...)\nKudo:\nKah! There are other things I recognize about her, too.\nPhoenix:\n(He seems pretty sure of himself. What should I do?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(There's got to be a better line of attack than this. That's what I should be looking for now...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSure, you saw a waitress take the coffee over to the victim. But what matters is whether that waitress was Maggey Byrde or not.\nJudge:\nQuite right. Mr. Kudo. These other \"features\" that you recognize about the defendant... I would ask you to add them to your testimony.\nKudo:\nSure, sure.\nAdds statement \"There was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose.\"Press (after adding statement \"There was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose.\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou said, \"I remember her well\" in reference to the waitress...

But what about the most crucial detail of all... her face?\nKudo:\nKah! As if I wouldn't remember that!\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nThe witness noticed the straps on the accused's apron. He'd unlikely to make a mistake about her face.\nKudo:\nThat's right! I can even tell you the color of the ribbon in her hair. It was red!\nGodot:\nSo you see, there's nothing wrong with the witness's eyesight.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\n(There's no doubt he remembers the waitress pretty well. What should I do? I get the feeling there's something more to this somehow...)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, I must be imagining it. I need to find another angle with this guy.)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nAsk about the straps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. Kudo. You seem especially interested in straps. Why is that?\nKudo:\nWh-What?\nPhoenix:\nThe ribbon in her hair, the straps on her apron. What's the fascination?\nKudo:\nF-Fascination?\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nPeople have all kinds of fetishes, Trite. We don't need to embarrass the witness.\nKudo:\nListen, you young upstarts! I haven't got some sick strap fetish!\nJudge:\nHmm... Is there any relevance to the witness's unusual love of straps, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nI was just curious as to why he was so fixated on the waitress's straps...\nKudo:\nI said I haven't got a strap fetish! How many times do I have to repeat myself!?\nJudge:\nVery well. Continue with your testimony, Mr. Kudo. And make it strapless.\nKudo:\n*grumble grumble*\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nAsk about the waitress's back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe identifying \"features\" you described are all things you would see from the back.\nKudo:\nSo what?\nPhoenix:\nIs it possible that... ...you never saw the waitress from the front at all!?\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHa...! He's got you there, gramps!\nPhoenix:\nPeople normally talk about facial features when they're asked to describe someone. But this witness's testimony is nothing but straps and ribbons!\nKudo:\nTh-This is harassment! I tell you I'm not obsessed with straps or ribbons! I'm just telling you what I saw!\nJudge:\nMr. Kudo, the court requests that you add details about any identifying features... Features you observed from the front, that is, to your testimony.\nKudo:\nSure, sure.\nMaya:\nThe old man's testimony is getting longer and longer!\nPhoenix:\nAnd if I can't find a hole in it soon, it'll get even longer, I bet.\nAdds statement \"There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front.\"Press (after adding statement \"There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front.\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou do seem to remember several details about her appearance.

I didn't come this far to back down now! Victor Kudo never backs down!\nPhoenix:\n(That's not the answer I was looking for, but OK...)\nMaya:\nThis has turned into a matter of pride for Old Seedy now, I guess...

You saw Mr. Glen Elg?\nKudo:\nI wanted to know if Gusten Brawn retained his championship or not.\nPhoenix:\n(So he was looking at the sports paper the victim was reading, huh...) And at the location in question... ...there are partitions between tables on the same side of the restaurant, right?\nKudo:\nSo what if there are?\nPhoenix:\nIf you say that you could see the victim... ...that means you were sitting at a table on the other side of the restaurant, correct?\nKudo:\nKah! I go to that place to drink javaccino! I don't go to sit! I don't remember what table I was sitting at!\nPhoenix:\n(You mean you go there to eye the waitress!)Kudo:\nThe serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. Kudo. That is a very grave accusation. Are you sure about what you saw?\nKudo:\nVictor Kudo never makes mistakes! I dot every t and cross every i!\nPhoenix:\nI see...\nKudo:\nMy eyesight's fine. The doctor said I only need spectacles for reading and driving.\nPhoenix:\n(...I bet his eyes are only really \"fine\" when he's scoping out a waitress.)\nKudo:\nAnd I saw what the serving girl put into the javaccino as well!\nPhoenix:\n(I bet I know what's coming up and something tells me I'm not going to like it...)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(It'd be dangerous to press this too much. I'd better ignore it for now.) So, what happened next?\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor. We need more clarification on what was put into the victim's coffee. I'd like to ask that the witness add what he knows about this to his testimony.\nJudge:\nHmm... I agree. Witness, will you enlighten us, please?\nKudo:\nSure, sure.\nAdds statement \"There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there.\"Press (after adding statement \"There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there.\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. Kudo. That is a very grave accusation.

The doctor said I only need spectacles for reading and driving.\nPhoenix:\n(...I bet his eyes are only really \"fine\" when he's scoping out a waitress.)\nKudo:\nAnd I saw what the serving girl put into the javaccino as well!Kudo:\nThere's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nD-Did she really put that into the coffee?\nKudo:\nYou doubt me, boy!? She too some out of a small, brown bottle and sprinkled it in.\nPhoenix:\nCouldn't she have been adding sugar?\nKudo:\nSugar!? In a small, brown bottle like that!?\nJudge:\n\"Like that\"? Witness, could you please describe the bottle in more concrete terms?\nGodot:\nHa...! A bottle like this, perhaps?\nKudo:\nOh, there it is! That's the one!\nJudge:\nThat's the bottle of potassium cyanide, I presume?\nGodot:\nSo what did the accused put into the coffee? I think it's clear, don't you?\nPhoenix:\nArgh...Kudo:\nThe man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe took just one sip?\nKudo:\nYou young'uns! You waste everything! Those javaccinos cost 8 dollars! In the good old days, we would have drank every last drop, eaten the cup, and then died!\nPhoenix:\n(Congratulations. You have earned the title of Battiest Man To Grace A Courtroom.)\nGodot:\nSo it was an immediate death? Well, with potassium cyanide, I suppose that is possible.\nKudo:\nOh, yes. He slumped over without so much as a twitch! I felt the javaccino I'd just drank turn sour in my stomach.\nGodot:\nOh, yes. I know that feeling.\nJudge:\nAnd the waitress? I presume she is...?Kudo:\nThat's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou said, \"I remember her well\" in reference to the waitress...

It's a disgrace, that's what it is!\nPhoenix:\nSorry?\nKudo:\nYou can see all the way up to her... her... You know! She's practically naked in that uniform!\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo the particular feature you recognize about the waitress is... her outfit!? But anyone could wear just such an [sic] uniform! Even me!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Please spare the court of any further mental anguish from that image.\nMaya:\nDon't get all excited, Nick! You've gotta keep yourself together!\nPhoenix:\n(I-I guess I got a bit carried away...)\nKudo:\nKah! There are other things I recognize about her, too.\nPhoenix:\n(He seems pretty sure of himself. What should I do?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(There's got to be a better line of attack than this.

But what matters is whether that waitress was Maggey Byrde or not.\nJudge:\nQuite right. Mr. Kudo. These other \"features\" that you recognize about the defendant... I would ask you to add them to your testimony.\nKudo:\nSure, sure.\nAdds statement \"There was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose.\"Press (after adding statement \"There was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose.\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou said, \"I remember her well\" in reference to the waitress...

But what about the most crucial detail of all... her face?\nKudo:\nKah! As if I wouldn't remember that!\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nThe witness noticed the straps on the accused's apron. He'd unlikely to make a mistake about her face.\nKudo:\nThat's right! I can even tell you the color of the ribbon in her hair. It was red!\nGodot:\nSo you see, there's nothing wrong with the witness's eyesight.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\n(There's no doubt he remembers the waitress pretty well. What should I do? I get the feeling there's something more to this somehow...)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, I must be imagining it. I need to find another angle with this guy.)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nAsk about the straps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. Kudo. You seem especially interested in straps. Why is that?\nKudo:\nWh-What?\nPhoenix:\nThe ribbon in her hair, the straps on her apron. What's the fascination?\nKudo:\nF-Fascination?\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nPeople have all kinds of fetishes, Trite. We don't need to embarrass the witness.\nKudo:\nListen, you young upstarts! I haven't got some sick strap fetish!\nJudge:\nHmm... Is there any relevance to the witness's unusual love of straps, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nI was just curious as to why he was so fixated on the waitress's straps...\nKudo:\nI said I haven't got a strap fetish! How many times do I have to repeat myself!?\nJudge:\nVery well. Continue with your testimony, Mr. Kudo. And make it strapless.\nKudo:\n*grumble grumble*\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nAsk about the waitress's back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe identifying \"features\" you described are all things you would see from the back.\nKudo:\nSo what?\nPhoenix:\nIs it possible that... ...you never saw the waitress from the front at all!?\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHa...! He's got you there, gramps!\nPhoenix:\nPeople normally talk about facial features when they're asked to describe someone. But this witness's testimony is nothing but straps and ribbons!\nKudo:\nTh-This is harassment! I tell you I'm not obsessed with straps or ribbons! I'm just telling you what I saw!\nJudge:\nMr. Kudo, the court requests that you add details about any identifying features... Features you observed from the front, that is, to your testimony.\nKudo:\nSure, sure.\nMaya:\nThe old man's testimony is getting longer and longer!\nPhoenix:\nAnd if I can't find a hole in it soon, it'll get even longer, I bet.\nAdds statement \"There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front.\"Press (after adding statement \"There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front.\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou do seem to remember several details about her appearance.

I didn't come this far to back down now! Victor Kudo never backs down!\nPhoenix:\n(That's not the answer I was looking for, but OK...)\nMaya:\nThis has turned into a matter of pride for Old Seedy now, I guess... I wonder if he really did see Maggey's face or not...\nPhoenix:\n(Like I thought, we need some concrete proof of this. Proof that the old guy didn't see the waitress clearly from the front.)Present Apron\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Kudo.

I guess I should've expected this. Nobody saw the other guy, huh? But he was there when I took the coffee over, sir. Scout's honor!???:\nMaggey!Byrde:\nAck! D-Detective Gumshoe!Gumshoe:\nA-Are you doing alright!? How're you feeling!?Byrde:\n...As if you need to ask either question, sir.Gumshoe:\nDon't let 'em get you down, Maggey. And don't forget to eat well, OK?Byrde:\nRoger!Gumshoe:\nAnd you!Phoenix:\nY-Yes?Gumshoe:\nYou'd better square this case away, got it pal!? Maggey's innocent, you hear!? If you screw up, then I'll be doing some squaring away myself. Squaring away some paperwork for your arrest!Phoenix:\n(I-I think he's serious!)Maya:\nHey, Detective! You're on our side for once, right?Gumshoe:\nYup.Maya:\nSo you'll be able to help Maggey out, right?Byrde:\nReally? Can you, sir!?Gumshoe:\nO... Of course! I've got the simulation under control! I'm gonna be the first witness on the stand today. If something I say doesn't mesh with the facts, make sure you point it out, alright?Phoenix:\nS-Sure.Gumshoe:\nOK. We're forming a united front today, pal. You get me!?Byrde:\nI can't tell you how grateful I am, sir! I've always admired you so much, Detective. I know I can count on you.Maya:\nLooks like it should all go pretty smoothly today, huh?Phoenix:\n(I can only wish...)January 7, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Maggey Byrde.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Godot:\n... Aaah, bitter!Judge:\nMr... Um... Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor?Judge:\nAaaah!Phoenix:\nWh-What's wrong!?Judge:\nNothing. It's just whenever I addressed you in the previous trial, your response was... \"Youse talkin' to me!?\" It was a little, well... intimidating.Phoenix:\nNo, no! That wasn't me. That was the phony Phoenix.Judge:\nI see. So our trusty Phoenix Wright is back with us now, is he?Phoenix:\n(\"Our trusty\"...?)Judge:\nSo, Mr. Godot. Your opening statement, please.Godot:\nMr. Trite... Whether you're a fake or the real deal... We will find out soon enough through this trial today.Phoenix:\nBut I can already tell you! I'm the real Phoenix Wright!Godot:\nI wasn't questioning whether you are Phoenix Wright or not. I was questioning whether you had studied law or not. That's what I intend to find out.Phoenix:\n(There's no denying it. Behind that mask is a man who really hates me for some reason or another!)Judge:\nAs everyone is aware, the court has already given its verdict on this case once. Therefore, I won't stand for irrelevant testimony during this retrial. Nor will I stand for a simple repetition of the evidence presented in the last trial.Phoenix:\n(I'm not planning on repeating anything that phony me said! Trust me!)Judge:\nNow then. Mr. Godot, please summon your first witness.Godot:\nLet's start with the formalities, shall we? Name and occupation?Gumshoe:\n...Judge:\nWitness! State your name for the court!Gumshoe:\nHuh? Oh, sorry, sir! The name's Police Department Detective. Occupation, Dick Gumshoe.Godot:\nOther way around, Detective.Gumshoe:\nHuh? Oh! Sorry. Anyway, I'm the officer in charge of this case since yesterday. Sir!Judge:\nSince yesterday?Gumshoe:\nYeah. The guy who was on the initial investigation's tied up with another case now.Maya:\nI hope Gumshoe's really got everything under control... For everyone's sake.Judge:\nI see. So, Detective Gumshoe... Would you outline for the court the basic facts of the case?Gumshoe:\nY-Y-Yes, sir. The victim's name was Glen Elg. He was a professional programmer. He was on the payroll of Blue Screens Inc., a local company. This is the victim's autopsy report.Judge:\nThe court accepts this into evidence.Glen's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.Gumshoe:\nUm... And here are the floor plans of the restaurant. When the incident took place, the victim was sitting right here. The poisoned coffee was brought over to him by the, um... By the waitress.Judge:\nThe waitress being the accused?Gumshoe:\nYeah... The victim died from poisoning almost immediately after he took a sip of the coffee. At the time of the incident, there were two other people in the restaurant. Mr. Jean Armstrong, the owner and chef. And a regular by the name of Mr. Victor Kudo.Judge:\nHmm... It still seems to be a very straightforward case to me.Tr\u00e9s Bien Floor Plans added to the Court Record.Godot:\nCome, Detective. Take up this hammer. And nail the defendant's coffin shut with your own two hands.Judge:\nNow then, Detective Gumshoe. Let's have your testimony.Gumshoe:\nUmm... Yes, sir...Witness Testimony-- The Incident --Gumshoe:\nWhen the incident took place, the victim was alone at his table, sir.\nWe understand that the guy, Glen Elg, was listening to the radio at the time.\nTraces of poison were found in his coffee cup.\nAnd what we found was potassium cyanide. That stuff really packs a punch!\nAnd, um... it looks like Ms. Byrde might've had, well... some kind of a motive.Judge:\nHmm...Godot:\nUsing the dark, aromatic depths of coffee to conceal the poison... Classy lady!Judge:\nThe facts of this case seem to be ironclad. Mr. Wright. I would ask you to begin your cross-examination, but...Phoenix:\nYes?Judge:\nPlease, no intimidation tricks this time around. Is that understood?Phoenix:\nI already told you! That wasn't me!Cross Examination-- The Incident --Gumshoe:\nWhen the incident took place, the victim was alone at his table, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nCan I stop you for just a minute?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? What is it? Did I say something that contradicts the evidence?\nPhoenix:\n(He'd so desperate for that to be true, he's practically crying!) Your testimony just now doesn't match the testimony given by Ms. Byrde. She claims that there was another man at the victim's table.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's what she said. And I--\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nWhat killer wouldn't say that when faced with a homicide conviction?\nPhoenix:\nHey!\nGodot:\nSadly, her testimony isn't supported by the owner or the other customer. Isn't that right, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, it's true. Their two testimonies tie up on that. They both said there was no other guy at the table.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.)\nMaya:\nIf you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad.\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, maybe the other witnesses just missed him! Perhaps their view of the victim's table was obscured in some way.\nGodot:\nHa...! That argument is as weak as the coffee at Tr\u00e9s Bien, Trite!\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nI have here in my possession a ticket.\nPhoenix:\nA ticket? (Looks more like a photo to me.)\nGodot:\nYes. A one-way ticket to guilty-ville! Population: the defendant! This is a photograph taken from near the entrance to the kitchen.\nJudge:\nThis is the scene as witnessed by the chef, moments after the poisoning took place, correct?\nGodot:\nI think the court will agree that with such a clear view of the scene of the crime... ...how, Mr. Trite, could anyone have overlooked a second person at the table?\nPhoenix:\nUrk!\nJudge:\nIt certainly seems to show the victim's table extremely clearly.\nCrime Photo added to the Court Record.\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after Crime Photo is added to the Court Record)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nCan I stop you for just a minute?\nGumshoe:\nHuh?

He had a portable radio in his chest pocket.\nMaya:\nMaggey told us that too, didn't she? Something about how \"one of them had some sort of earpiece\".\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.)\nMaya:\nIf you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad.\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd what was it that the victim was listening to on the radio, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? How should I know?\nPhoenix:\n(Thanks a lot... We're now one step closer to the middle of nowhere.)\nMaya:\nThis isn't going very well, is it...?\nJudge:\nHmm... Detective. Could you perhaps tell us about the poison and how it was used?\nLeads back to cross-examinationGumshoe:\nTraces of poison were found in his coffee cup.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, traces of the poison were found in the coffee cup and nowhere else?\nGumshoe:\nNot sure I get you, pal.\nPhoenix:\nWas the poison a liquid? Or was it a powder?\nGumshoe:\nIf I had to put it in layman's terms, I'd say it was a powdery substance.\nPhoenix:\nSo the poison could've been in anything that was on the table. Sugar, salt, pepper...\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHa...! Do you put salt and pepper in your coffee, Trite?\nGumshoe:\nThe victim took his coffee black, with no sugar.\nPhoenix:\nNngh...\nJudge:\nIt seems that the poison could only have been in the coffee.\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.)\nMaya:\nIf you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad.\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely certain that the victim even drank any of his coffee?\nGumshoe:\nHuh!? What do you mean?\nPhoenix:\nAccording to this file, \"the poison was found in the victim's coffee cup.\" But what proof is there that the victim ever drank any of it!?\nGumshoe:\nOh, hey! You're right! That's what I was think--\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nIn case you were wondering, that last objection was for the detective there.\nGumshoe:\nHuh? For me?\nGodot:\n\"Oh, hey! You're right!\"? You may be fooling the court, but I'm not falling for it. If you have the time to waste, you have the time to present that piece of evidence.\nGumshoe:\nTh... THAT piece... sir?\nGodot:\nYes. THAT piece.\nGumshoe:\n... Um... Aheh heh heh! Wh-What piece was it again?\nGodot:\nThis!\nPhoenix:\n(Should I be grateful this coffee's only hot enough to give me 1st degree burns...?)\nGumshoe:\nOh. Now I remember! Um... This is the, uh... victim's coffee cup.\nGodot:\nYes, the victim's cup. Take a good look at the rim.\nJudge:\nOh, yes. It's unmistakable. There is clearly a coffee stain on it.\nGodot:\nConclusive proof that the victim did drink the poisoned coffee that was in this cup. The victim gulped down the bitter death that the waitress brought to him... like this!\nPhoenix:\nUuuurgh!\nGumshoe:\nFor the record, the only prints on the cup were the victim's and the defendant's.\nCoffee Cup added to the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\nUpon further investigation of this cup... we found a certain chemical substance...\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after Coffee Cup is added to the Court Record)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, traces of the poison were found in the coffee cup and nowhere else?\nGumshoe:\nNot sure I get you, pal.\nPhoenix:\nWas the poison a liquid?

That stuff really packs a punch!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n(Potassium cyanide? I've heard of that chemical before...) Exactly how strong is this poison, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nIt's... Well... That stuff's lethal! Eat too much, and you're history.\nMaya:\nHow much is too much?\nGodot:\nA lethal dose is 0.2 grams. That's about enough to finish anyone off.\nMaya:\n0.2 grams? How much is that?\nGumshoe:\nYou know when you swab your ears for earwax? Yeah, about that much.\nPhoenix:\n(Earwax, huh? Sounds like something Gumshoe's got an abundance of...)\nJudge:\nHmm... Such a small quantity of poison could have been concealed anywhere.Gumshoe:\nAnd, um... it looks like Ms. Byrde might've had, well... some kind of a motive.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Some kind of a motive\"?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. But if you ask me, it's been blown way out of proportion.\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nYou know what my golden rule is, Detective? Chuck out a bad cup of coffee. You can always get another.\nGumshoe:\nHuh? I don't get it.\nGodot:\nI'm saying, we can always get another witness on the stand, if we have to chuck you out.\nGumshoe:\n*gulp*\nGodot:\nSo stick to the facts, Detective. Now then, what was Ms. Byrde's motive?\nPhoenix:\n(Come on, Gumshoe...)\nGumshoe:\nShe was... They said she wanted to steal a lottery ticket.\nPhoenix:\nI knew it... (That's what we heard yesterday, too.)\nGumshoe:\nIt disappeared from the scene of the crime.\nGodot:\nAnd it wasn't just any lottery ticket. It was a winning ticket for half a million!\nMaya:\nMr. Armstrong knew about the ticket too, didn't he? But he stole the wrong one...\nPhoenix:\n(Then is it possible Maggey stole the winning one? What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.)\nMaya:\nIf you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad.\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWait a minute! The mere fact that the lottery ticket disappeared in no way implicates my client!\nGodot:\nHa...! I have here in my hand... the very ticket in question!\nJudge:\nTh-That's the half a million dollar lottery ticket...?\nGumshoe:\nOne of the female police officers found it when she was conducting a search... ...of the defendant.\nPhoenix:\nWH-WHAAAAAT!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order!\nGodot:\nHa...! She's quite a lucky bird, our little waitress.\nJudge:\nY-You will submit that ticket as evidence to the court! Immediately!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, I'd better keep an eye on that ticket. The way the judge's voice is quivering...)\nVictim's Lottery Ticket added to the Court Record.\nJudge:\nThe ticket was presented to the court in the previous trial, too. But it feels heavier now somehow. H-Half a million dollars, you say...?\nGodot:\nIt's just a scrap of paper. What matters is where it was found, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\n(And that's on Maggey's person, unfortunately...) (Changed from [I bet he wants to say it was found on Maggey's person...] in the original release)\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after Victim's Lottery Ticket is added to the Court Record)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Some kind of a motive\"?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. But if you ask me, it's been blown way out of proportion.\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nYou know what my golden rule is, Detective? Chuck out a bad cup of coffee. You can always get another.\nGumshoe:\nHuh?

It was a winning ticket for half a million!\nMaya:\nMr. Armstrong knew about the ticket too, didn't he? But he stole the wrong one...\nPhoenix:\n(Then is it possible Maggey stole the winning one?)Maya:\nYou really think there are any contradictions in this testimony?Phoenix:\nTo be honest, I don't know.Maya:\nBut Gumshoe told us out in the lobby. He said we'd be forming a united front, right? How will we win the case if he doesn't throw us a line?Phoenix:\n(I don't have a whole lot of options right now... The best I can do is gather the facts together, I guess.)After selecting \"Press harder\" upon pressing first, third, and fifth statements:Judge:\nThat's enough! The facts of this case seem overwhelmingly clear to me. The defendant had ample opportunity to commit the crime of which she is charged. Furthermore, it seems beyond reasonable doubt that she did indeed commit this crime.Godot:\nI like an old man who knows the score.Judge:\nThere is also the matter of the half a million dollar lottery ticket. That alone provides a very credible motive. I mean, for that sum of money even I might be tempted to bend the rules!Godot:\nI don't mind an old man who is weak to the siren call of money.Maya:\nNot good, Nick... The evidence against Maggey is starting to pile up fast.Phoenix:\nYeah, that's because the court has ruled guilty once already.Godot:\nI'd say it's about time to wrap up this repeat performance... ...with one final, decisive piece of evidence.Phoenix:\n(He's got more evidence against Maggey!?)Godot:\nThis is the apron the delightful Ms. Byrde was wearing at the time.Maya:\nWow... That's not the cleanest apron I've seen...Phoenix:\nTh-That stain looks like...! (It can't be... blood, can it!?)Godot:\nHa...! It seems the star of our play was a little flustered... And somehow spilled coffee on herself.Phoenix:\nThe coffee!? That's not exactly the first thing that caught my eye...Godot:\nOf course. The coffee stain isn't the most interesting thing about this apron. No, there's something else that stands out even more.Judge:\nSomething else? I presume you mean...Godot:\nOf course. I'm referring to the pocket.Phoenix:\nThe... pocket?Godot:\nA search carried out right after the incident uncovered this... Potassium cyanide. The very poison used by the killer, was in her apron pocket!Phoenix:\nA bottle of poison... In Maggey's pocket?Gumshoe:\nYeah. And Maggey's prints were the only ones on it.Phoenix:\nWHAAAT!?Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! The court will accept these items into evidence.Apron added to the Court Record.Potassium Cyanide added to the Court Record.Judge:\nThere's something still bothering me, Mr. Godot. Why have you not explained the bloodstain to the court?Godot:\nBloodstain? What bloodstain would that be?Judge:\nDon't play games, prosecutor! The blood-colored stain that's smeared all over the apron!Godot:\nThat's ridiculous! No one told me anything about a bloodstain!Phoenix:\n(You don't need to be told! Just look at it!)Godot:\nWell, Detective!? Could this stain really be... BLOOD!?Gumshoe:\nN-No way, sir! That's... It's just ketchup. Sir.Phoenix:\nKetchup!?Gumshoe:\nShe must've gotten some on her an apron while taking someone their breakfast that day.Judge:\n... You could have spoken up a little sooner, Detective Gumshoe!Godot:\nPull a stunt like that again, and I'll have you drink 17 cups of ketchup, witness!Gumshoe:\nUnnngh... I thought everyone knew what it was already.Judge:\nHmm... I haven't seen anything yet to make me doubt the last verdict I ruled on this case.Phoenix:\n...!Judge:\nThe motive, the opportunity, and the supporting evidence... They have all been clearly established.Godot:\nWell, Trite... It seems you really are a phony after all.Phoenix:\n(Argh! You really know how to drive a man nuts!)Judge:\nWitness, please continue with your testimony. Describe for the court the crime scene and the findings of your investigation there.Witness Testimony-- The Investigation --Gumshoe:\nThe crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.\nPoor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her.\nThe victim didn't have any identification on him.\nBut we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly.\nWhen Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison.\nAnd that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene.Judge:\nHmm... You identified the victim and secured your prime suspect... Very good.Godot:\nLast chance to convince the court you're a real lawyer, Trite!Phoenix:\n...!Godot:\nDon't court on any more cross-examinations after this one! So, let the fun begin!Cross Examination-- The Investigation --Gumshoe:\nThe crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Scary old man\", Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nThere's an old man who's a regular at the restaurant where the incident happened.\nPhoenix:\n(Ah, we're obviously talking about the same old man...)\nGumshoe:\nOfficers were dispatched right after the report came in, but the old guy still made a fuss. \"What took you so long!?\" Then he hurled abuse at them. And seeds...\nJudge:\nHmm... Seeds...\nGodot:\nHa...! It was nothing! I caught each one with my teeth.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess not even the mighty Godot can avoid being attacked by that guy...)\nGodot:\nThe old man was only other customer in the place at the time. He took his time finding a pay phone apparently, so he was late reporting the crime.Gumshoe:\nPoor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow long was the defendant unconscious for?\nGumshoe:\nThe officers got to the crime scene at around 2:40. Maggey was still out cold in the kitchen at that time. It took another 10 minutes or so before she came to. I woulda liked to have been on the scene myself.\nPhoenix:\n(I bet you would've liked to have carried out the search, too...)\nGumshoe:\nI woulda loved to see Maggey asleep like that, all pretty and peaceful.\nPhoenix:\n(You're a professional detective, Gumshoe. Not a professional bird watcher!)\nGodot:\nSave the romantics for your own time, Detective. All we need to know about is the investigation.\nGumshoe:\nOops! I guess I'm pretty red right now, aren't I?Gumshoe:\nThe victim didn't have any identification on him.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe didn't have any? Are you saying that it was stolen, then?\nGumshoe:\nNo, I don't think so. The victim didn't have a driver's license or even a credit card on him, pal. All he had was 58 cents in his wallet.\nPhoenix:\nFifty-eight cents...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. I can't believe I found someone with less in their wallet than me, pal!\nJudge:\nThe victim sounds like he was a thoroughly miserable young man.\nGodot:\nOr some kind of outlaw... Why not give him a bit of an edge?\nPhoenix:\n(I think I'm on to something here...)Gumshoe:\nBut we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWait a sec!\nGumshoe:\nHuh? D-Did I say something dumb again!?\nPhoenix:\nLet me paraphrase what you just testified to this court. \"The victim didn't have any form of ID on him.\" That's basically what you said, yes?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, basically.\nPhoenix:\nIn that case, how were you able to identify the victim so quickly?\nGumshoe:\n... Oh... That.\nPhoenix:\n(He's so let down, he's got the whole sagging shoulders and puppy eyes thing going...)\nGumshoe:\nThere was a prescription bag on the victim's table along with the lottery ticket.\nGodot:\nIt seems Mr. Glen Elg visited his doctor before he went to Tr\u00e9s Bien.\nGumshoe:\nWe got the victim's name from the medical records of the doc who prescribed the meds.\nJudge:\nHmm... That's a reliable enough source for the court.\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I leave this alone or ask to hear more?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I guess it doesn't really matter how they figured out who the victim was. There are more important avenues to explore.)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nAsk about the prescription bag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo what sort of medicine was in the bag?\nGumshoe:\nWell... Actually, the bag we found was empty.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. Completely empty.\nPhoenix:\n(It was completely empty...?)\nVictim's Prescription Bag added to the Court Record.\nGodot:\nHa...! You're entering an empty paper bag as evidence? Desperate, are you, Trite?\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nNow, what happened with the investigation after that, Detective?\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nAsk about his health insurance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, the victim had no form of identification on him, correct?\nGumshoe:\nYeah.\nPhoenix:\nAnd yet, before arriving at the restaurant, he went to see a doctor. Which means... He must've had his medical insurance card with him!\nJudge:\nOh! That is very true!\nPhoenix:\nThe fact that it hasn't been found points to only one obvious conclusion. The victim's medical card was stolen!\nGodot:\nHa...! True, the victim didn't have a medical insurance card. But why? Because Mr. Glen Elg didn't have medical insurance to begin with!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nJudge:\nHmm... As I thought, a thoroughly miserable young man.\nGodot:\nOr some kind of outlaw... A bit of an edge never hurt anyone.\nMaya:\nLooks like we're off course again, Nick.\nJudge:\nWitness. Please continue with your testimony. Explain for the court the events following the preliminary investigation.\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after Victim's Prescription Bag is added to the Court Record)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWait a sec!\nGumshoe:\nHuh?

That's a reliable enough source for the court.Gumshoe:\nWhen Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBut the defendant had been passed out for a while, correct? In that case... Isn't it possible someone planted the evidence in Maggey's pocket!?\nGumshoe:\nHey! Y-Yeah! You've nailed it, pal!\nJudge:\nHmm...\nGumshoe:\nIt happens to me all the time! We had a department party the other day, and when I got home... ...I was wearing the boss's shoes!\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nKeep up this crazy testimony, Detective, and those shoes will end up down your throat!\nGumshoe:\nSorry...\nGodot:\nSo, Trite. \"Someone planted the evidence in Maggey's pocket\"...? That's a pretty bold statement. Care to back it up with some evidence?\nPhoenix:\nUm... Well... (I'd love to, if I had any...)\nJudge:\nIt appears you have no evidence to support your theory, Mr. Wright. Continue with your testimony, witness.Gumshoe:\nAnd that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo the half a million dollar lottery ticket and the bottle of poison were accounted for.\nGumshoe:\nYeah.\nPhoenix:\nInteresting... It's true that those two items are accounted for... ..but wasn't there another lottery ticket that was stolen that day?\nGumshoe:\nOh, yeah. The one the restaurant owner took. He won a whole dollar with it. What a lucky guy, huh?\nPhoenix:\n(And they're just going to let him get away with it...?)\nJudge:\nIt was just one dollar, Detective.\nMaya:\nI guess no one cares when it's that little... Unless it's Gumshoe.Present Victim's Prescription Bag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Detective Gumshoe. I think I should point something out to you.\"Phoenix:\nIf I don't find a hole in this testimony, the judge is going to hand down his verdict!Maya:\nGumshoe isn't giving us anything to work with... And we can't find any contradictions if he doesn't give us something!Phoenix:\nYeah, that's true... But Maggey and Gumshoe are like dumb and dumber. Our only hope is that they were so dumb, they missed something obvious.Maya:\nCome on, Gumshoe! Be the dumbest you've ever been!Phoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe. I think I should point something out to you. There is just one small contradiction in your testimony.Gumshoe:\nOho! Finally! I'm getting all anxious just waiting, so hurry up, will you?Phoenix:\nYou testified that, \"nothing else was missing from the crime scene.\" However! The prescription bag you mentioned was empty! Did the officers recover the medicine from the scene of the crime later?Gumshoe:\nUm, no. They didn't.Phoenix:\nThe victim was given a prescription right before going to Tr\u00e9s Bien. Where, then, did the medicine disappear to!?Gumshoe:\nY-You... ...are toooooo coool, pal!!Judge:\nI-Indeed! Due consideration wasn't given to the victim's prescription in the previous trial. Witness! Why do you always overlook such vital pieces of evidence!?Gumshoe:\nI, er... I guess that's the most careless thing I've done so far, huh?Phoenix:\nThe victim was killed by poison! And the victim's \"medicine\" mysteriously disappeared! The victim's own prescription could have been the lethal poison itself!Judge:\nO-Order! Order! Well, Mr. Godot? What do you have to say to that?Godot:\nHa...! That's all.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Godot:\nRead for the court the name of the clinic on the prescription bag, if you will.Phoenix:\nWhat's the clinic's name got to do with anything...? \"New Ear Otolaryngological Clinic\" O-Otolaryngological?Judge:\nJust what kind of illness was the victim suffering from, Mr. Godot?Godot:\nHardly an illness, Your Honor. More like a bitter war wound, you could say.Judge:\nA war wound?Godot:\nThe day before the incident, Mr. Elg found himself in a fight. He took a blow to the side of the head, and ruptured his eardrum.Phoenix:\nHe ruptured his eardrum!?Judge:\nThen what on earth was the prescription he was given?Godot:\nIt was a cream that was to be applied topically inside his ear canal, not to be ingested!Phoenix:\nWhat!?Godot:\nIt's mentioned in the autopsy report, if you read the fine print. They found traces of the medication in the victim's left ear.Judge:\nYes. Here it is. In very, very fine print.Godot:\nIt seems Mr. Elg correctly applied some of his medication while he was at Tr\u00e9s Bien. Therefore, it would be absurd to believe that he would have eaten his medication.Phoenix:\nUuurgh...Judge:\nIt seems that this medication is irrelevant to the case after all.Phoenix:\nN-No...Maya:\nNick! If you don't think of something quick, it'll all be over!Phoenix:\n(She's right. But I can't get away with any old weak objection. What should I do...?)Push the medication issue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Only moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement.\"Leave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt does seem as it the medication isn't connected to the case.\nGodot:\nHa...! Maybe the last Mr. Trite was the real one. At least he didn't waste time.\nJudge:\nIndeed... If you have nothing further to add to this medication issue... ...the facts of this case seem no different to those presented on the last trial. I would therefore have no choice but to hand down my verdict.\nPhoenix:\nUh... Umm...!\nMaya:\nNick! Don't let him to do this! You've got to stand your ground!\nJudge:\nNow then...\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWait, Your Honor! Actually, this prescription... is absolutely pivotal to the case!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Did you not just say the exact opposite only moments ago!?\nPhoenix:\n(Gotta lose a few battles in order to win the war, I suppose.)\nLeads to:\n\"Only moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement.\"Phoenix:\nOnly moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement. \"It seems Mr. Elg correctly applied some of his medication while he was at Tr\u00e9s Bien.\" If that's the case, then why was the medication not found at the scene of the crime!?Godot:\n...!Judge:\nBut the medication in question was for topical use inside the ear canal!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nThat doesn't change the fact that it could not be found at the crime scene! However insignificant it may seem, it's a lawyer's duty to pursue the truth!Godot:Godot:\nYou know as well as I do that the medication is irrelevant. It hardly seems likely that a prescription drug would contain potassium cyanide.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nIt hardly seems likely that the coffee the waitress served would contain it, either! But it did! The possibility is undeniable!Godot:\nAaargh!Judge:\nThat's enough. Mr. Godot. Is the detective the only witness the prosecution wishes to call?Godot:\n...Judge:\nMr. Godot...?Godot:\n...Gumshoe:\nUm... I, ah... I've got my own witness I'd like to call, sir. It's the old man who was there in the restaurant on the day of the murder.Phoenix:\n(Victor Kudo? The pigeon-hater?)Judge:\nVery well. The matter of the disappearing medication seems little more than trivial at best. However! It wasn't explored at all in the previous trial. And that is something that bothers me.Maya:\nYay! Good job, Nick!Judge:\nThe court will adjourn for a 10 minute recess. After which we will hear the prosecution's next witness.Godot:\nHa...! I suppose this means I'll just have to finish you off in my last 6 cups.Judge:\nCourt is adjourned for recess!January 7, 11:03 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Maya:\nPhew! That was close!Phoenix:\nTell me about it... I nearly died in there!Byrde:\nThat's my line, sir!Maya:\nNo! It's my line! I think I really did die a little bit.Byrde:\nLooks like we all nearly died in there... I can't believe Detective Gumshoe! How could he betray us like that!?Maya:\nHuh?Byrde:\nHe said he'd help me. But he totally set me up!Phoenix:\nI don't think he meant to do that, Maggey. He was backed into a corner. I mean, the guy's got to do his job, right?Byrde:\nIt's OK. I know all about lies and betrayal. I've had them my whole life. But it really hurt this time. It felt like someone punched me hard in the stomach! I hate that guy! I don't ever want to see him again!Phoenix:\n(Poor Gumshoe...)Maya:\nSo the next witness is going to be that old guy from the park, right?Phoenix:\nYeah. Mr. Kudo. Lover of waitress outfits and projectile seeds!Byrde:\nI bet he's gonna be really stubborn. I mean, he's pretty set in his ways, you know?Maya:\nYeah, he's a big old grouch. Are you going to be able to handle him, Nick?Phoenix:\nYeah, I can take whatever he throws at me. Even those never-ending bird seeds!January 7, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:\nCourt will now reconvene for the trial of Maggey Byrde. Mr. Godot. Your next witness, please.Godot:\nThe prosecution calls the lucky old-timer who caught the show over a cup of coffee. Will the witness please take the stand.Godot:\nName and occupation, if you don't mind.Kudo:\nThe name is Victor Kudo. Born and bred in the Land of the Rising Sun! Honor and duty are what make me. Mind you, I can be quite emotional at times, too.Phoenix:\nWe don't need to hear about that, Mr. Kudo. Just tell the court your occupation.Kudo:\nMy occupation? Kah! Listen, young'un! How much call d'you think there is for kimono embroidery here!?Phoenix:\nKimono embroidery?Kudo:\nThat's what I do! Or did, back in Japan. I embroidered family crests on kimonos! My ancestors were embroidering kimonos before this country even existed!Maya:\nWow, a real craftsman! They're a dying breed! Hey! Maybe he could embroider my costume sometime.Kudo:\nAnyway, like I said. There's not much demand for that kind of thing here. So I had to take a job working the cash register at a burger joint... pretending to smile!Phoenix:\n(That burger joint would've been better off putting him in the kitchen...)Judge:\nNow then, witness. Were you in the restaurant at the time of the incident?Kudo:\nOh, yes! I was eating some seeds over a cup of javaccino.Judge:\nSeeds?Kudo:\nWhat do you think these are, hmm!?Judge:\nI-I see...Godot:\nSo you saw everything that happened, gramps?Kudo:\nDid I!? Oh, yes! Oh, yes I did! I saw it all!Godot:\nThen please, tell the court. We're all ears.Kudo:\nSure, sure. I'll tell you. I'll tell you every last detail!Phoenix:\n(He's really getting into this...)Witness Testimony-- What I Witnessed --Kudo:\nThe young man was reading the sports paper.\nThe serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it!\nThe man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed.\nThat's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well!Judge:\nMr. Kudo. she is not a \"serving girl\". Please refer to her as a waitress.Kudo:\nKah! You're as bad as the rest of them! All these newfangled words! What's wrong with old-fashioned ones, hmm!?Judge:\nN-Newfangled?Kudo:\nAll this talk of \"radios\" and \"glasses\"! It's \"wireless\" and \"spectacles\", I tell you!Judge:\nE-Excuse me...Kudo:\nListen to me, everyone! Don't forget the old values! Don't let the good old days slip away!Judge:\nWell, um... I think it's time to begin the cross-examination, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor.Cross Examination-- What I Witnessed --Kudo:\nThe young man was reading the sports paper.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you saw the victim, then? You saw Mr. Glen Elg?\nKudo:\nI wanted to know if Gusten Brawn retained his championship or not.\nPhoenix:\n(So he was looking at the sports paper the victim was reading, huh...) And at the location in question... ...there are partitions between tables on the same side of the restaurant, right?\nKudo:\nSo what if there are?\nPhoenix:\nIf you say that you could see the victim... ...that means you were sitting at a table on the other side of the restaurant, correct?\nKudo:\nKah! I go to that place to drink javaccino! I don't go to sit! I don't remember what table I was sitting at!\nPhoenix:\n(You mean you go there to eye the waitress!)Kudo:\nThe serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. Kudo. That is a very grave accusation. Are you sure about what you saw?\nKudo:\nVictor Kudo never makes mistakes! I dot every t and cross every i!\nPhoenix:\nI see...\nKudo:\nMy eyesight's fine. The doctor said I only need spectacles for reading and driving.\nPhoenix:\n(...I bet his eyes are only really \"fine\" when he's scoping out a waitress.)\nKudo:\nAnd I saw what the serving girl put into the javaccino as well!\nPhoenix:\n(I bet I know what's coming up and something tells me I'm not going to like it...)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(It'd be dangerous to press this too much. I'd better ignore it for now.) So, what happened next?\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor. We need more clarification on what was put into the victim's coffee. I'd like to ask that the witness add what he knows about this to his testimony.\nJudge:\nHmm... I agree.

She very conspicuously put some white powder in there.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nD-Did she really put that into the coffee?\nKudo:\nYou doubt me, boy!? She too some out of a small, brown bottle and sprinkled it in.\nPhoenix:\nCouldn't she have been adding sugar?\nKudo:\nSugar!? In a small, brown bottle like that!?\nJudge:\n\"Like that\"? Witness, could you please describe the bottle in more concrete terms?\nGodot:\nHa...! A bottle like this, perhaps?\nKudo:\nOh, there it is! That's the one!\nJudge:\nThat's the bottle of potassium cyanide, I presume?\nGodot:\nSo what did the accused put into the coffee? I think it's clear, don't you?\nPhoenix:\nArgh...Kudo:\nThe man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe took just one sip?\nKudo:\nYou young'uns! You waste everything! Those javaccinos cost 8 dollars! In the good old days, we would have drank every last drop, eaten the cup, and then died!\nPhoenix:\n(Congratulations. You have earned the title of Battiest Man To Grace A Courtroom.)\nGodot:\nSo it was an immediate death? Well, with potassium cyanide, I suppose that is possible.\nKudo:\nOh, yes. He slumped over without so much as a twitch! I felt the javaccino I'd just drank turn sour in my stomach.\nGodot:\nOh, yes. I know that feeling.\nJudge:\nAnd the waitress? I presume she is...?Kudo:\nThat's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou said, \"I remember her well\" in reference to the waitress... Did she have any particular features that you can identify her by?\nKudo:\nParticular features!? It's a disgrace, that's what it is!\nPhoenix:\nSorry?\nKudo:\nYou can see all the way up to her... her... You know! She's practically naked in that uniform!\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo the particular feature you recognize about the waitress is... her outfit!? But anyone could wear just such an [sic] uniform! Even me!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Please spare the court of any further mental anguish from that image.\nMaya:\nDon't get all excited, Nick! You've gotta keep yourself together!\nPhoenix:\n(I-I guess I got a bit carried away...)\nKudo:\nKah! There are other things I recognize about her, too.\nPhoenix:\n(He seems pretty sure of himself. What should I do?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(There's got to be a better line of attack than this. That's what I should be looking for now...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSure, you saw a waitress take the coffee over to the victim. But what matters is whether that waitress was Maggey Byrde or not.\nJudge:\nQuite right. Mr. Kudo. These other \"features\" that you recognize about the defendant... I would ask you to add them to your testimony.\nKudo:\nSure, sure.\nAdds statement \"There was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose.\"Press (after adding statement \"There was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose.\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou said, \"I remember her well\" in reference to the waitress... Did she have any particular features that you can identify her by?\nKudo:\nParticular features!?

There are other things I recognize about her, too.Kudo:\nThere was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou do seem to remember several details about her appearance. But what about the most crucial detail of all... her face?\nKudo:\nKah! As if I wouldn't remember that!\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nThe witness noticed the straps on the accused's apron. He'd unlikely to make a mistake about her face.\nKudo:\nThat's right! I can even tell you the color of the ribbon in her hair. It was red!\nGodot:\nSo you see, there's nothing wrong with the witness's eyesight.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\n(There's no doubt he remembers the waitress pretty well. What should I do? I get the feeling there's something more to this somehow...)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, I must be imagining it. I need to find another angle with this guy.)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nAsk about the straps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. Kudo. You seem especially interested in straps. Why is that?\nKudo:\nWh-What?\nPhoenix:\nThe ribbon in her hair, the straps on her apron. What's the fascination?\nKudo:\nF-Fascination?\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nPeople have all kinds of fetishes, Trite. We don't need to embarrass the witness.\nKudo:\nListen, you young upstarts! I haven't got some sick strap fetish!\nJudge:\nHmm... Is there any relevance to the witness's unusual love of straps, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nI was just curious as to why he was so fixated on the waitress's straps...\nKudo:\nI said I haven't got a strap fetish! How many times do I have to repeat myself!?\nJudge:\nVery well. Continue with your testimony, Mr. Kudo. And make it strapless.\nKudo:\n*grumble grumble*\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nAsk about the waitress's back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe identifying \"features\" you described are all things you would see from the back.\nKudo:\nSo what?\nPhoenix:\nIs it possible that... ...you never saw the waitress from the front at all!?\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHa...! He's got you there, gramps!\nPhoenix:\nPeople normally talk about facial features when they're asked to describe someone. But this witness's testimony is nothing but straps and ribbons!\nKudo:\nTh-This is harassment! I tell you I'm not obsessed with straps or ribbons! I'm just telling you what I saw!\nJudge:\nMr. Kudo, the court requests that you add details about any identifying features... Features you observed from the front, that is, to your testimony.\nKudo:\nSure, sure.\nMaya:\nThe old man's testimony is getting longer and longer!\nPhoenix:\nAnd if I can't find a hole in it soon, it'll get even longer, I bet.\nAdds statement \"There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front.\"Press (after adding statement \"There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front.\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou do seem to remember several details about her appearance. But what about the most crucial detail of all... her face?\nKudo:\nKah! As if I wouldn't remember that!\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nThe witness noticed the straps on the accused's apron. He'd unlikely to make a mistake about her face.\nKudo:\nThat's right! I can even tell you the color of the ribbon in her hair. It was red!\nGodot:\nSo you see, there's nothing wrong with the witness's eyesight.\nJudge:\nHmm...Kudo:\nThere wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou didn't find anything to be distinct, but you did clearly see the witness's face, yes?\nKudo:\nNo question about it! I didn't come this far to back down now! Victor Kudo never backs down!\nPhoenix:\n(That's not the answer I was looking for, but OK...)\nMaya:\nThis has turned into a matter of pride for Old Seedy now, I guess... I wonder if he really did see Maggey's face or not...\nPhoenix:\n(Like I thought, we need some concrete proof of this. Proof that the old guy didn't see the waitress clearly from the front.)Present Apron\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Kudo. I would like you to please take a look at this.\"Maya:\nDo you think Old Seedy really saw Maggey do it?Phoenix:\nWell, he probably had his eye on the waitress the whole time. That's why he was there.Maya:\nBut he was there for the cute outfits, right? Not the waitress...Phoenix:\nI-I guess... (Hmm, she makes a good point though...)Maya:\nHey! Did I just say something clever?Phoenix:\nI wonder if the waitress Mr. Kudo saw really was Maggey...Maya:\nThat's what we have to figure out, Nick!Phoenix:\nMr. Kudo. I would like you to please take a look at this.Kudo:\nKah! That filthy thing would suit filth like you just perfectly. Actually, it reminds me of what my grandson looks like, just after he's done eating.Phoenix:\nHave you ever seen this before?Kudo:\nOf course I haven't! Do you think I'd forget something as dirty as that!? Hmm? Well? You half-witted clot!?Phoenix:\n...Judge:\n............Kudo:\nWh-What!? What is it!? Ever since I said, \"you half-witted clot\", there's been an eerie silence in here.Phoenix:\nMr. Kudo. This apron... ...is the apron worn by the defendant on the day of the poisoning!Kudo:\nUh?Phoenix:\nAnd as you just said yourself... ...you wouldn't forget something like this. Which means, is you had really seen this apron before...Kudo:\nEr...Phoenix:\nYes, you know what I'm getting at! You couldn't have possibly seen the waitress from the front!Kudo:\n... Oops!Judge:\nWitness! You can't just \"oops\" your way out of this!Godot:\nHa...! Well, well... Looks like we finally have a genuine trial on our hands.Phoenix:\n...Godot:\nListen, Trite. Here are the facts. On the day of the incident, there was only one waitress in the restaurant.Judge:\nThat being the defendant, Ms. Maggey Byrde?Godot:\nExactly. And when that one waitress put the poison into the coffee cup... ...this old guy was watching!Judge:\nHmm... I hope you understand the gravity of the situation, Mr. Kudo. The fate of the defendant may rest on what you say you remember seeing.Godot:\nJust tell the court exactly what you saw, gramps.Kudo:\nYou can rely on me, Captain! My noggin's in perfect working order. I can't remember a single occasion when I forgot what burger a customer wanted!Maya:\nHe can't remember? Probably more like he messes up so many times, he's blocking it out...Judge:\nVery well. Let's test just how good your memory and attention to detail is, Mr. Kudo. Tell us what you remember about the victim.Witness Testimony-- About the Victim --Kudo:\nHe was another of those pesky young types, wearing a broken pair of spectacles.\nHe had a newspaper in his right hand, and the noisy brat kept rustling its pages!\nThe young man was listening to the wireless. I remember that well.\nThen the serving girl in question brought over the javaccino.\nThe little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip.Judge:\nThe testimony we have just heard was to test how credible the witness's memory is. It seems to me that he remembers the victim in a great deal of detail.Kudo:\nOh, yes! I hate those you-know-what types who are so vague about everything!Maya:\nHow are we going to handle this, Nick?Phoenix:\nWe only need to do one thing. We just need to prove that the old man's memory is shot.Maya:\nJust trip him up, you mean? Isn't that kind of cruel?Phoenix:\n(I suppose... But it's what I do best.)Cross Examination-- About the Victim --Kudo:\nHe was another of those pesky young types, wearing a broken pair of spectacles.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSpectacles?\nKudo:\nDark glasses to you! One of the lenses was green, but the other was broken. Newfangled rubbish! That's why I remember him so well.\nPhoenix:\n(He did have some kind of lens over his left eye... But I wouldn't have called it a pair of glasses.)\nJudge:\nHmm... He seems to have been wearing some rather modern-looking shades. Perhaps I should take to wearing some, and rival Mr. Godot's sharp appearance.\nMaya:\nAh! We better come up with something sharp, and quick!\nPhoenix:\n(Guess I'll wait and see if I should challenge him about the \"spectacles\"...)Kudo:\nHe had a newspaper in his right hand, and the noisy brat kept rustling its pages!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe newspaper was a sports paper, was it?\nKudo:\nThat young hooligan! I nearly asked him, \"Can't you even read without fidgeting, hmm!?\" How was I supposed to be able to read the back page with all that rustling going on!? I needed to find out if Gusten Brawn retained his championship title!\nPhoenix:\n(It was his paper, not yours! If you wanted to know so bad, why didn't you buy your own!?)\nKudo:\nWhat are looking [sic] at me like that for, hmm!? How dare you judge me!\nPhoenix:\nOw! Ooow!\nMaya:\nGusten Brawn got beaten yesterday, by the way. Anyway...Kudo:\nThe young man was listening to the wireless. I remember that well.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe wireless?\nKudo:\nThe decadent young rascal! In my day, it was one or the other! Read the paper, or listen to the wireless!\nPhoenix:\n(...Oh boy.)\nKudo:\nAnd using an earpiece! It's selfish, that's what it is! I was straining my ears, but I couldn't catch any of it.\nPhoenix:\n(Was he that desperate to listen to the radio...?)\nKudo:\nWhat are looking [sic] at me like that for, hmm!? 2 you feel sorry for me!\nPhoenix:\nOw! Oooow!Kudo:\nThen the serving girl in question brought over the javaccino.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou mean the waitress, who you only saw from behind, right?\nKudo:\nYou're one of those, are you? You never let anything go, isn't that right?\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe.\nKudo:\nWhat does it matter if I saw her from the front or from behind!? My eyes don't lie!\nPhoenix:\nOw! Oooow! (I better not push it until I've got some hard evidence.)Kudo:\nThe little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"His free hand\"?\nKudo:\nYes.\nPhoenix:\nWhich hand was that?\nKudo:\nWeren't you listening before, cloth-ears!? I said he was rustling the newspaper with his right hand, didn't I? If his free hand wasn't his right hand, then which hand was it, you moron!\nPhoenix:\nOw! Oooow!\nGodot:\nHa...! Perhaps the great Mr. Trite has three hands!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeesh! I was only asking! No need to gang up on me and treat me like a freak!)Present Coffee Cup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Kudo. Do you remember what you were told at the start of this testimony?\"Phoenix:\n(The whole point of this cross-examination is to establish just one thing... That this old guy's memory has more holes than a slice of Swiss.)Maya:\nI guess we just need to find a contradiction in his testimony somewhere, huh?Phoenix:\n(Anything will do. Even the smallest detail. We just need one mistake, and he's ours!)Phoenix:\nMr. Kudo. Do you remember what you were told at the start of this testimony? That this was a way of testing the credibility of your memory?Kudo:\nI know, I know! There's nothing wrong with my memory, I tell you! Nothing! If I got anything wrong, I'll eat these seeds and sing the pigeon song!Godot:\nCare to tell us where this is going, Trite?Phoenix:\nAccording to Mr. Kudo, the victim was holding the paper in his right hand... ...while drinking coffee with his free hand, which would make that his left.Kudo:\nKah! What is this? Kindergarten?Phoenix:\nBut I would like the court to please take a look at this.Judge:\nThat's the cup victim used, correct?Phoenix:\nYes, and on the rim, you'll notice the mark left by the victim's lips.Judge:\nYes. There is a stain left by the coffee.Phoenix:\nIf you consider where that stain is, you'll clearly see... ...that the victim was holding the cup in his right hand!Kudo:\nBut how...?Phoenix:\nWell, Mr. Kudo. The court is waiting for your epic performance! You said you'd eat those seeds and sing the pigeon song!Kudo:\nAaaargh!Judge:\nMr. Kudo... I'm afraid this is simply not acceptable. I think the witness had better go back to the park where he came from.Kudo:\nWAAAAIT! If you think I'm going to stand here and listen to you tell me I'm mad, you're wrong! I don't care about that dirty coffee cup! I know what I saw!Judge:\nY-You still insist on your testimony?Kudo:\nThat young brat was holding the cup in his left hand! Oh, yes. No question! I'm a good, law-abiding citizen, I am. It's that dead young hotbot and you, you spikey-haired yahoo, who are at fault!Phoenix:\n(Who, me!?)Judge:\nTh-Thank you, old man. We've heard quite enough from you already.Kudo:\nDon't call me \"old man\", old man! Been around for 68 years, I have. You can't ignore me! LISTEN TO WHAT I'VE GOT TO SAAAAY!Judge:\nI'm sorry, Mr. Kudo, but...Godot:\nSure, why not hear a little more?Judge:\nM-Mr. Godot!Godot:\nBut this is my 16th cup of coffee... So this is your final stand.Kudo:\nThank you, Captain! You can rely on Victor!Witness Testimony-- Left Hand or Right Hand --Kudo:\nThe boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs.\nHe kept fiddling with it all the time.\nHe was fiddling with it just before he picked up the cup, too.\nAnd then he used the same hand to pick up the cup. His left hand!Judge:\nWe know that the victim was wearing an unusual monocle over his left eye.Godot:\nIt wasn't a monocle, Your Honor. It was a small computer monitor often used by programmers.Judge:\nA monitor? You mean, like a television screen!?Godot:\nThe inside of the lens is a screen that displays computer data. It's called an HMD. It's a common tool in the victim's line of work.Kudo:\nHDTV, DVD, CD... All these newfangled letters drive me mad! But they don't matter. I know what I saw, and I'm telling the truth!Phoenix:\n(It's true... He doesn't seem to be lying.)Kudo:\nAnd those are the facts, in good old black and white!Cross Examination",

Do you remember what you were told at the start of this testimony?\"Phoenix:\n(The whole point of this cross-examination is to establish just one thing... That this old guy's memory has more holes than a slice of Swiss.)Maya:\nI guess we just need to find a contradiction in his testimony somewhere, huh?Phoenix:\n(Anything will do. Even the smallest detail. We just need one mistake, and he's ours!)Phoenix:\nMr. Kudo. Do you remember what you were told at the start of this testimony? That this was a way of testing the credibility of your memory?Kudo:\nI know, I know! There's nothing wrong with my memory, I tell you! Nothing! If I got anything wrong, I'll eat these seeds and sing the pigeon song!Godot:\nCare to tell us where this is going, Trite?Phoenix:\nAccording to Mr. Kudo, the victim was holding the paper in his right hand... ...while drinking coffee with his free hand, which would make that his left.Kudo:\nKah! What is this? Kindergarten?Phoenix:\nBut I would like the court to please take a look at this.Judge:\nThat's the cup victim used, correct?Phoenix:\nYes, and on the rim, you'll notice the mark left by the victim's lips.Judge:\nYes. There is a stain left by the coffee.Phoenix:\nIf you consider where that stain is, you'll clearly see... ...that the victim was holding the cup in his right hand!Kudo:\nBut how...?Phoenix:\nWell, Mr. Kudo. The court is waiting for your epic performance! You said you'd eat those seeds and sing the pigeon song!Kudo:\nAaaargh!Judge:\nMr. Kudo... I'm afraid this is simply not acceptable. I think the witness had better go back to the park where he came from.Kudo:\nWAAAAIT! If you think I'm going to stand here and listen to you tell me I'm mad, you're wrong! I don't care about that dirty coffee cup! I know what I saw!Judge:\nY-You still insist on your testimony?Kudo:\nThat young brat was holding the cup in his left hand! Oh, yes. No question! I'm a good, law-abiding citizen, I am. It's that dead young hotbot and you, you spikey-haired yahoo, who are at fault!Phoenix:\n(Who, me!?)Judge:\nTh-Thank you, old man. We've heard quite enough from you already.Kudo:\nDon't call me \"old man\", old man! Been around for 68 years, I have. You can't ignore me! LISTEN TO WHAT I'VE GOT TO SAAAAY!Judge:\nI'm sorry, Mr. Kudo, but...Godot:\nSure, why not hear a little more?Judge:\nM-Mr. Godot!Godot:\nBut this is my 16th cup of coffee... So this is your final stand.Kudo:\nThank you, Captain! You can rely on Victor!Witness Testimony-- Left Hand or Right Hand --Kudo:\nThe boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs.\nHe kept fiddling with it all the time.\nHe was fiddling with it just before he picked up the cup, too.\nAnd then he used the same hand to pick up the cup. His left hand!Judge:\nWe know that the victim was wearing an unusual monocle over his left eye.Godot:\nIt wasn't a monocle, Your Honor. It was a small computer monitor often used by programmers.Judge:\nA monitor? You mean, like a television screen!?Godot:\nThe inside of the lens is a screen that displays computer data. It's called an HMD. It's a common tool in the victim's line of work.Kudo:\nHDTV, DVD, CD... All these newfangled letters drive me mad! But they don't matter. I know what I saw, and I'm telling the truth!Phoenix:\n(It's true... He doesn't seem to be lying.)Kudo:\nAnd those are the facts, in good old black and white!Cross Examination",

D-Detective Gumshoe!Gumshoe:\nA-Are you doing alright!? How're you feeling!?Byrde:\n...As if you need to ask either question, sir.Gumshoe:\nDon't let 'em get you down, Maggey. And don't forget to eat well, OK?Byrde:\nRoger!Gumshoe:\nAnd you!Phoenix:\nY-Yes?Gumshoe:\nYou'd better square this case away, got it pal!? Maggey's innocent, you hear!? If you screw up, then I'll be doing some squaring away myself. Squaring away some paperwork for your arrest!Phoenix:\n(I-I think he's serious!)Maya:\nHey, Detective! You're on our side for once, right?Gumshoe:\nYup.Maya:\nSo you'll be able to help Maggey out, right?Byrde:\nReally? Can you, sir!?Gumshoe:\nO... Of course! I've got the simulation under control! I'm gonna be the first witness on the stand today. If something I say doesn't mesh with the facts, make sure you point it out, alright?Phoenix:\nS-Sure.Gumshoe:\nOK. We're forming a united front today, pal. You get me!?Byrde:\nI can't tell you how grateful I am, sir! I've always admired you so much, Detective. I know I can count on you.Maya:\nLooks like it should all go pretty smoothly today, huh?Phoenix:\n(I can only wish...)January 7, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Maggey Byrde.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Godot:\n... Aaah, bitter!Judge:\nMr... Um... Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor?Judge:\nAaaah!Phoenix:\nWh-What's wrong!?Judge:\nNothing. It's just whenever I addressed you in the previous trial, your response was... \"Youse talkin' to me!?\" It was a little, well... intimidating.Phoenix:\nNo, no! That wasn't me. That was the phony Phoenix.Judge:\nI see. So our trusty Phoenix Wright is back with us now, is he?Phoenix:\n(\"Our trusty\"...?)Judge:\nSo, Mr. Godot. Your opening statement, please.Godot:\nMr. Trite... Whether you're a fake or the real deal... We will find out soon enough through this trial today.Phoenix:\nBut I can already tell you! I'm the real Phoenix Wright!Godot:\nI wasn't questioning whether you are Phoenix Wright or not. I was questioning whether you had studied law or not. That's what I intend to find out.Phoenix:\n(There's no denying it. Behind that mask is a man who really hates me for some reason or another!)Judge:\nAs everyone is aware, the court has already given its verdict on this case once. Therefore, I won't stand for irrelevant testimony during this retrial. Nor will I stand for a simple repetition of the evidence presented in the last trial.Phoenix:\n(I'm not planning on repeating anything that phony me said! Trust me!)Judge:\nNow then. Mr. Godot, please summon your first witness.Godot:\nLet's start with the formalities, shall we? Name and occupation?Gumshoe:\n...Judge:\nWitness! State your name for the court!Gumshoe:\nHuh? Oh, sorry, sir! The name's Police Department Detective. Occupation, Dick Gumshoe.Godot:\nOther way around, Detective.Gumshoe:\nHuh? Oh! Sorry. Anyway, I'm the officer in charge of this case since yesterday. Sir!Judge:\nSince yesterday?Gumshoe:\nYeah. The guy who was on the initial investigation's tied up with another case now.Maya:\nI hope Gumshoe's really got everything under control... For everyone's sake.Judge:\nI see. So, Detective Gumshoe... Would you outline for the court the basic facts of the case?Gumshoe:\nY-Y-Yes, sir. The victim's name was Glen Elg. He was a professional programmer. He was on the payroll of Blue Screens Inc., a local company. This is the victim's autopsy report.Judge:\nThe court accepts this into evidence.Glen's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.Gumshoe:\nUm... And here are the floor plans of the restaurant. When the incident took place, the victim was sitting right here. The poisoned coffee was brought over to him by the, um... By the waitress.Judge:\nThe waitress being the accused?Gumshoe:\nYeah... The victim died from poisoning almost immediately after he took a sip of the coffee. At the time of the incident, there were two other people in the restaurant. Mr. Jean Armstrong, the owner and chef. And a regular by the name of Mr. Victor Kudo.Judge:\nHmm... It still seems to be a very straightforward case to me.Tr\u00e9s Bien Floor Plans added to the Court Record.Godot:\nCome, Detective. Take up this hammer. And nail the defendant's coffin shut with your own two hands.Judge:\nNow then, Detective Gumshoe. Let's have your testimony.Gumshoe:\nUmm... Yes, sir...Witness Testimony-- The Incident --Gumshoe:\nWhen the incident took place, the victim was alone at his table, sir.\nWe understand that the guy, Glen Elg, was listening to the radio at the time.\nTraces of poison were found in his coffee cup.\nAnd what we found was potassium cyanide. That stuff really packs a punch!\nAnd, um... it looks like Ms. Byrde might've had, well... some kind of a motive.Judge:\nHmm...Godot:\nUsing the dark, aromatic depths of coffee to conceal the poison... Classy lady!Judge:\nThe facts of this case seem to be ironclad. Mr. Wright. I would ask you to begin your cross-examination, but...Phoenix:\nYes?Judge:\nPlease, no intimidation tricks this time around. Is that understood?Phoenix:\nI already told you! That wasn't me!Cross Examination-- The Incident --Gumshoe:\nWhen the incident took place, the victim was alone at his table, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nCan I stop you for just a minute?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? What is it? Did I say something that contradicts the evidence?\nPhoenix:\n(He'd so desperate for that to be true, he's practically crying!) Your testimony just now doesn't match the testimony given by Ms. Byrde. She claims that there was another man at the victim's table.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's what she said. And I--\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nWhat killer wouldn't say that when faced with a homicide conviction?\nPhoenix:\nHey!\nGodot:\nSadly, her testimony isn't supported by the owner or the other customer. Isn't that right, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, it's true. Their two testimonies tie up on that. They both said there was no other guy at the table.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.)\nMaya:\nIf you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad.\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, maybe the other witnesses just missed him! Perhaps their view of the victim's table was obscured in some way.\nGodot:\nHa...! That argument is as weak as the coffee at Tr\u00e9s Bien, Trite!\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nI have here in my possession a ticket.\nPhoenix:\nA ticket? (Looks more like a photo to me.)\nGodot:\nYes. A one-way ticket to guilty-ville! Population: the defendant! This is a photograph taken from near the entrance to the kitchen.\nJudge:\nThis is the scene as witnessed by the chef, moments after the poisoning took place, correct?\nGodot:\nI think the court will agree that with such a clear view of the scene of the crime... ...how, Mr. Trite, could anyone have overlooked a second person at the table?\nPhoenix:\nUrk!\nJudge:\nIt certainly seems to show the victim's table extremely clearly.\nCrime Photo added to the Court Record.\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after Crime Photo is added to the Court Record)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nCan I stop you for just a minute?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? What is it? Did I say something that contradicts the evidence?\nPhoenix:\n(He'd so desperate for that to be true, he's practically crying!) Your testimony just now doesn't match the testimony given by Ms. Byrde. She claims that there was another man at the victim's table.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that's what she said. And I--\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nWhat killer wouldn't say that when faced with a homicide conviction?\nPhoenix:\nHey!\nGodot:\nSadly, her testimony isn't supported by the owner or the other customer. Isn't that right, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, it's true. Their two testimonies tie up on that. They both said there was no other guy at the table.\nJudge:\nHmm...Gumshoe:\nWe understand that the guy, Glen Elg, was listening to the radio at the time.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe was listening to his radio, you say?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. He had a portable radio in his chest pocket.\nMaya:\nMaggey told us that too, didn't she? Something about how \"one of them had some sort of earpiece\".\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.)\nMaya:\nIf you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad.\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd what was it that the victim was listening to on the radio, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? How should I know?\nPhoenix:\n(Thanks a lot... We're now one step closer to the middle of nowhere.)\nMaya:\nThis isn't going very well, is it...?\nJudge:\nHmm... Detective. Could you perhaps tell us about the poison and how it was used?\nLeads back to cross-examinationGumshoe:\nTraces of poison were found in his coffee cup.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, traces of the poison were found in the coffee cup and nowhere else?\nGumshoe:\nNot sure I get you, pal.\nPhoenix:\nWas the poison a liquid? Or was it a powder?\nGumshoe:\nIf I had to put it in layman's terms, I'd say it was a powdery substance.\nPhoenix:\nSo the poison could've been in anything that was on the table. Sugar, salt, pepper...\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHa...! Do you put salt and pepper in your coffee, Trite?\nGumshoe:\nThe victim took his coffee black, with no sugar.\nPhoenix:\nNngh...\nJudge:\nIt seems that the poison could only have been in the coffee.\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.)\nMaya:\nIf you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad.\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely certain that the victim even drank any of his coffee?\nGumshoe:\nHuh!? What do you mean?\nPhoenix:\nAccording to this file, \"the poison was found in the victim's coffee cup.\" But what proof is there that the victim ever drank any of it!?\nGumshoe:\nOh, hey! You're right! That's what I was think--\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nIn case you were wondering, that last objection was for the detective there.\nGumshoe:\nHuh? For me?\nGodot:\n\"Oh, hey! You're right!\"? You may be fooling the court, but I'm not falling for it. If you have the time to waste, you have the time to present that piece of evidence.\nGumshoe:\nTh... THAT piece... sir?\nGodot:\nYes. THAT piece.\nGumshoe:\n... Um... Aheh heh heh! Wh-What piece was it again?\nGodot:\nThis!\nPhoenix:\n(Should I be grateful this coffee's only hot enough to give me 1st degree burns...?)\nGumshoe:\nOh. Now I remember! Um... This is the, uh... victim's coffee cup.\nGodot:\nYes, the victim's cup. Take a good look at the rim.\nJudge:\nOh, yes. It's unmistakable. There is clearly a coffee stain on it.\nGodot:\nConclusive proof that the victim did drink the poisoned coffee that was in this cup. The victim gulped down the bitter death that the waitress brought to him... like this!\nPhoenix:\nUuuurgh!\nGumshoe:\nFor the record, the only prints on the cup were the victim's and the defendant's.\nCoffee Cup added to the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\nUpon further investigation of this cup... we found a certain chemical substance...\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after Coffee Cup is added to the Court Record)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, traces of the poison were found in the coffee cup and nowhere else?\nGumshoe:\nNot sure I get you, pal.\nPhoenix:\nWas the poison a liquid? Or was it a powder?\nGumshoe:\nIf I had to put it in layman's terms, I'd say it was a powdery substance.\nPhoenix:\nSo the poison could've been in anything that was on the table. Sugar, salt, pepper...\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHa...! Do you put salt and pepper in your coffee, Trite?\nGumshoe:\nThe victim took his coffee black, with no sugar.\nPhoenix:\nNngh...\nJudge:\nIt seems that the poison could only have been in the coffee.Gumshoe:\nAnd what we found was potassium cyanide. That stuff really packs a punch!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n(Potassium cyanide? I've heard of that chemical before...) Exactly how strong is this poison, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nIt's... Well... That stuff's lethal! Eat too much, and you're history.\nMaya:\nHow much is too much?\nGodot:\nA lethal dose is 0.2 grams. That's about enough to finish anyone off.\nMaya:\n0.2 grams? How much is that?\nGumshoe:\nYou know when you swab your ears for earwax? Yeah, about that much.\nPhoenix:\n(Earwax, huh? Sounds like something Gumshoe's got an abundance of...)\nJudge:\nHmm... Such a small quantity of poison could have been concealed anywhere.Gumshoe:\nAnd, um... it looks like Ms. Byrde might've had, well... some kind of a motive.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Some kind of a motive\"?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. But if you ask me, it's been blown way out of proportion.\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nYou know what my golden rule is, Detective? Chuck out a bad cup of coffee. You can always get another.\nGumshoe:\nHuh? I don't get it.\nGodot:\nI'm saying, we can always get another witness on the stand, if we have to chuck you out.\nGumshoe:\n*gulp*\nGodot:\nSo stick to the facts, Detective. Now then, what was Ms. Byrde's motive?\nPhoenix:\n(Come on, Gumshoe...)\nGumshoe:\nShe was... They said she wanted to steal a lottery ticket.\nPhoenix:\nI knew it... (That's what we heard yesterday, too.)\nGumshoe:\nIt disappeared from the scene of the crime.\nGodot:\nAnd it wasn't just any lottery ticket. It was a winning ticket for half a million!\nMaya:\nMr. Armstrong knew about the ticket too, didn't he? But he stole the wrong one...\nPhoenix:\n(Then is it possible Maggey stole the winning one? What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.)\nMaya:\nIf you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling.

The mere fact that the lottery ticket disappeared in no way implicates my client!\nGodot:\nHa...! I have here in my hand... the very ticket in question!\nJudge:\nTh-That's the half a million dollar lottery ticket...?\nGumshoe:\nOne of the female police officers found it when she was conducting a search... ...of the defendant.\nPhoenix:\nWH-WHAAAAAT!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order!\nGodot:\nHa...! She's quite a lucky bird, our little waitress.\nJudge:\nY-You will submit that ticket as evidence to the court! Immediately!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, I'd better keep an eye on that ticket. The way the judge's voice is quivering...)\nVictim's Lottery Ticket added to the Court Record.\nJudge:\nThe ticket was presented to the court in the previous trial, too. But it feels heavier now somehow. H-Half a million dollars, you say...?\nGodot:\nIt's just a scrap of paper. What matters is where it was found, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\n(And that's on Maggey's person, unfortunately...) (Changed from [I bet he wants to say it was found on Maggey's person...] in the original release)\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after Victim's Lottery Ticket is added to the Court Record)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Some kind of a motive\"?\nGumshoe:\nYeah.

But he stole the wrong one...\nPhoenix:\n(Then is it possible Maggey stole the winning one?)Maya:\nYou really think there are any contradictions in this testimony?Phoenix:\nTo be honest, I don't know.Maya:\nBut Gumshoe told us out in the lobby. He said we'd be forming a united front, right? How will we win the case if he doesn't throw us a line?Phoenix:\n(I don't have a whole lot of options right now... The best I can do is gather the facts together, I guess.)After selecting \"Press harder\" upon pressing first, third, and fifth statements:Judge:\nThat's enough! The facts of this case seem overwhelmingly clear to me. The defendant had ample opportunity to commit the crime of which she is charged. Furthermore, it seems beyond reasonable doubt that she did indeed commit this crime.Godot:\nI like an old man who knows the score.Judge:\nThere is also the matter of the half a million dollar lottery ticket. That alone provides a very credible motive. I mean, for that sum of money even I might be tempted to bend the rules!Godot:\nI don't mind an old man who is weak to the siren call of money.Maya:\nNot good, Nick... The evidence against Maggey is starting to pile up fast.Phoenix:\nYeah, that's because the court has ruled guilty once already.Godot:\nI'd say it's about time to wrap up this repeat performance... ...with one final, decisive piece of evidence.Phoenix:\n(He's got more evidence against Maggey!?)Godot:\nThis is the apron the delightful Ms. Byrde was wearing at the time.Maya:\nWow... That's not the cleanest apron I've seen...Phoenix:\nTh-That stain looks like...! (It can't be... blood, can it!?)Godot:\nHa...! It seems the star of our play was a little flustered... And somehow spilled coffee on herself.Phoenix:\nThe coffee!? That's not exactly the first thing that caught my eye...Godot:\nOf course. The coffee stain isn't the most interesting thing about this apron. No, there's something else that stands out even more.Judge:\nSomething else? I presume you mean...Godot:\nOf course. I'm referring to the pocket.Phoenix:\nThe... pocket?Godot:\nA search carried out right after the incident uncovered this... Potassium cyanide. The very poison used by the killer, was in her apron pocket!Phoenix:\nA bottle of poison... In Maggey's pocket?Gumshoe:\nYeah. And Maggey's prints were the only ones on it.Phoenix:\nWHAAAT!?Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! The court will accept these items into evidence.Apron added to the Court Record.Potassium Cyanide added to the Court Record.Judge:\nThere's something still bothering me, Mr. Godot. Why have you not explained the bloodstain to the court?Godot:\nBloodstain? What bloodstain would that be?Judge:\nDon't play games, prosecutor! The blood-colored stain that's smeared all over the apron!Godot:\nThat's ridiculous! No one told me anything about a bloodstain!Phoenix:\n(You don't need to be told! Just look at it!)Godot:\nWell, Detective!? Could this stain really be... BLOOD!?Gumshoe:\nN-No way, sir! That's... It's just ketchup. Sir.Phoenix:\nKetchup!?Gumshoe:\nShe must've gotten some on her an apron while taking someone their breakfast that day.Judge:\n... You could have spoken up a little sooner, Detective Gumshoe!Godot:\nPull a stunt like that again, and I'll have you drink 17 cups of ketchup, witness!Gumshoe:\nUnnngh... I thought everyone knew what it was already.Judge:\nHmm... I haven't seen anything yet to make me doubt the last verdict I ruled on this case.Phoenix:\n...!Judge:\nThe motive, the opportunity, and the supporting evidence... They have all been clearly established.Godot:\nWell, Trite... It seems you really are a phony after all.Phoenix:\n(Argh! You really know how to drive a man nuts!)Judge:\nWitness, please continue with your testimony. Describe for the court the crime scene and the findings of your investigation there.Witness Testimony-- The Investigation --Gumshoe:\nThe crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.\nPoor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her.\nThe victim didn't have any identification on him.\nBut we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly.\nWhen Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison.\nAnd that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene.Judge:\nHmm... You identified the victim and secured your prime suspect... Very good.Godot:\nLast chance to convince the court you're a real lawyer, Trite!Phoenix:\n...!Godot:\nDon't court on any more cross-examinations after this one! So, let the fun begin!Cross Examination-- The Investigation --Gumshoe:\nThe crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"Scary old man\", Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nThere's an old man who's a regular at the restaurant where the incident happened.\nPhoenix:\n(Ah, we're obviously talking about the same old man...)\nGumshoe:\nOfficers were dispatched right after the report came in, but the old guy still made a fuss. \"What took you so long!?\" Then he hurled abuse at them. And seeds...\nJudge:\nHmm... Seeds...\nGodot:\nHa...! It was nothing! I caught each one with my teeth.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess not even the mighty Godot can avoid being attacked by that guy...)\nGodot:\nThe old man was only other customer in the place at the time. He took his time finding a pay phone apparently, so he was late reporting the crime.Gumshoe:\nPoor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow long was the defendant unconscious for?\nGumshoe:\nThe officers got to the crime scene at around 2:40. Maggey was still out cold in the kitchen at that time. It took another 10 minutes or so before she came to. I woulda liked to have been on the scene myself.\nPhoenix:\n(I bet you would've liked to have carried out the search, too...)\nGumshoe:\nI woulda loved to see Maggey asleep like that, all pretty and peaceful.\nPhoenix:\n(You're a professional detective, Gumshoe. Not a professional bird watcher!)\nGodot:\nSave the romantics for your own time, Detective. All we need to know about is the investigation.\nGumshoe:\nOops! I guess I'm pretty red right now, aren't I?Gumshoe:\nThe victim didn't have any identification on him.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe didn't have any? Are you saying that it was stolen, then?\nGumshoe:\nNo, I don't think so. The victim didn't have a driver's license or even a credit card on him, pal. All he had was 58 cents in his wallet.\nPhoenix:\nFifty-eight cents...?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. I can't believe I found someone with less in their wallet than me, pal!\nJudge:\nThe victim sounds like he was a thoroughly miserable young man.\nGodot:\nOr some kind of outlaw... Why not give him a bit of an edge?\nPhoenix:\n(I think I'm on to something here...)Gumshoe:\nBut we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWait a sec!\nGumshoe:\nHuh? D-Did I say something dumb again!?\nPhoenix:\nLet me paraphrase what you just testified to this court. \"The victim didn't have any form of ID on him.\" That's basically what you said, yes?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, basically.\nPhoenix:\nIn that case, how were you able to identify the victim so quickly?\nGumshoe:\n... Oh... That.\nPhoenix:\n(He's so let down, he's got the whole sagging shoulders and puppy eyes thing going...)\nGumshoe:\nThere was a prescription bag on the victim's table along with the lottery ticket.\nGodot:\nIt seems Mr. Glen Elg visited his doctor before he went to Tr\u00e9s Bien.\nGumshoe:\nWe got the victim's name from the medical records of the doc who prescribed the meds.\nJudge:\nHmm... That's a reliable enough source for the court.\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I leave this alone or ask to hear more?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I guess it doesn't really matter how they figured out who the victim was. There are more important avenues to explore.)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nAsk about the prescription bag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo what sort of medicine was in the bag?\nGumshoe:\nWell... Actually, the bag we found was empty.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. Completely empty.\nPhoenix:\n(It was completely empty...?)\nVictim's Prescription Bag added to the Court Record.\nGodot:\nHa...! You're entering an empty paper bag as evidence? Desperate, are you, Trite?\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nNow, what happened with the investigation after that, Detective?\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nAsk about his health insurance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, the victim had no form of identification on him, correct?\nGumshoe:\nYeah.\nPhoenix:\nAnd yet, before arriving at the restaurant, he went to see a doctor. Which means... He must've had his medical insurance card with him!\nJudge:\nOh! That is very true!\nPhoenix:\nThe fact that it hasn't been found points to only one obvious conclusion. The victim's medical card was stolen!\nGodot:\nHa...! True, the victim didn't have a medical insurance card. But why? Because Mr. Glen Elg didn't have medical insurance to begin with!\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nJudge:\nHmm... As I thought, a thoroughly miserable young man.\nGodot:\nOr some kind of outlaw... A bit of an edge never hurt anyone.\nMaya:\nLooks like we're off course again, Nick.\nJudge:\nWitness. Please continue with your testimony. Explain for the court the events following the preliminary investigation.\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after Victim's Prescription Bag is added to the Court Record)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWait a sec!\nGumshoe:\nHuh?

That's a reliable enough source for the court.Gumshoe:\nWhen Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nBut the defendant had been passed out for a while, correct? In that case... Isn't it possible someone planted the evidence in Maggey's pocket!?\nGumshoe:\nHey! Y-Yeah! You've nailed it, pal!\nJudge:\nHmm...\nGumshoe:\nIt happens to me all the time! We had a department party the other day, and when I got home... ...I was wearing the boss's shoes!\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nKeep up this crazy testimony, Detective, and those shoes will end up down your throat!\nGumshoe:\nSorry...\nGodot:\nSo, Trite. \"Someone planted the evidence in Maggey's pocket\"...? That's a pretty bold statement. Care to back it up with some evidence?\nPhoenix:\nUm... Well... (I'd love to, if I had any...)\nJudge:\nIt appears you have no evidence to support your theory, Mr. Wright. Continue with your testimony, witness.Gumshoe:\nAnd that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo the half a million dollar lottery ticket and the bottle of poison were accounted for.\nGumshoe:\nYeah.\nPhoenix:\nInteresting... It's true that those two items are accounted for... ..but wasn't there another lottery ticket that was stolen that day?\nGumshoe:\nOh, yeah. The one the restaurant owner took. He won a whole dollar with it. What a lucky guy, huh?\nPhoenix:\n(And they're just going to let him get away with it...?)\nJudge:\nIt was just one dollar, Detective.\nMaya:\nI guess no one cares when it's that little... Unless it's Gumshoe.Present Victim's Prescription Bag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Detective Gumshoe. I think I should point something out to you.\"Phoenix:\nIf I don't find a hole in this testimony, the judge is going to hand down his verdict!Maya:\nGumshoe isn't giving us anything to work with... And we can't find any contradictions if he doesn't give us something!Phoenix:\nYeah, that's true... But Maggey and Gumshoe are like dumb and dumber. Our only hope is that they were so dumb, they missed something obvious.Maya:\nCome on, Gumshoe! Be the dumbest you've ever been!Phoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe. I think I should point something out to you. There is just one small contradiction in your testimony.Gumshoe:\nOho! Finally! I'm getting all anxious just waiting, so hurry up, will you?Phoenix:\nYou testified that, \"nothing else was missing from the crime scene.\" However! The prescription bag you mentioned was empty! Did the officers recover the medicine from the scene of the crime later?Gumshoe:\nUm, no. They didn't.Phoenix:\nThe victim was given a prescription right before going to Tr\u00e9s Bien. Where, then, did the medicine disappear to!?Gumshoe:\nY-You... ...are toooooo coool, pal!!Judge:\nI-Indeed! Due consideration wasn't given to the victim's prescription in the previous trial. Witness! Why do you always overlook such vital pieces of evidence!?Gumshoe:\nI, er... I guess that's the most careless thing I've done so far, huh?Phoenix:\nThe victim was killed by poison! And the victim's \"medicine\" mysteriously disappeared! The victim's own prescription could have been the lethal poison itself!Judge:\nO-Order! Order! Well, Mr. Godot? What do you have to say to that?Godot:\nHa...! That's all.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Godot:\nRead for the court the name of the clinic on the prescription bag, if you will.Phoenix:\nWhat's the clinic's name got to do with anything...? \"New Ear Otolaryngological Clinic\" O-Otolaryngological?Judge:\nJust what kind of illness was the victim suffering from, Mr. Godot?Godot:\nHardly an illness, Your Honor. More like a bitter war wound, you could say.Judge:\nA war wound?Godot:\nThe day before the incident, Mr. Elg found himself in a fight. He took a blow to the side of the head, and ruptured his eardrum.Phoenix:\nHe ruptured his eardrum!?Judge:\nThen what on earth was the prescription he was given?Godot:\nIt was a cream that was to be applied topically inside his ear canal, not to be ingested!Phoenix:\nWhat!?Godot:\nIt's mentioned in the autopsy report, if you read the fine print. They found traces of the medication in the victim's left ear.Judge:\nYes. Here it is. In very, very fine print.Godot:\nIt seems Mr. Elg correctly applied some of his medication while he was at Tr\u00e9s Bien. Therefore, it would be absurd to believe that he would have eaten his medication.Phoenix:\nUuurgh...Judge:\nIt seems that this medication is irrelevant to the case after all.Phoenix:\nN-No...Maya:\nNick! If you don't think of something quick, it'll all be over!Phoenix:\n(She's right. But I can't get away with any old weak objection. What should I do...?)Push the medication issue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"Only moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement.\"Leave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt does seem as it the medication isn't connected to the case.\nGodot:\nHa...! Maybe the last Mr. Trite was the real one. At least he didn't waste time.\nJudge:\nIndeed... If you have nothing further to add to this medication issue... ...the facts of this case seem no different to those presented on the last trial. I would therefore have no choice but to hand down my verdict.\nPhoenix:\nUh... Umm...!\nMaya:\nNick! Don't let him to do this! You've got to stand your ground!\nJudge:\nNow then...\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWait, Your Honor! Actually, this prescription... is absolutely pivotal to the case!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Did you not just say the exact opposite only moments ago!?\nPhoenix:\n(Gotta lose a few battles in order to win the war, I suppose.)\nLeads to:\n\"Only moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement.\"Phoenix:\nOnly moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement. \"It seems Mr. Elg correctly applied some of his medication while he was at Tr\u00e9s Bien.\" If that's the case, then why was the medication not found at the scene of the crime!?Godot:\n...!Judge:\nBut the medication in question was for topical use inside the ear canal!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nThat doesn't change the fact that it could not be found at the crime scene! However insignificant it may seem, it's a lawyer's duty to pursue the truth!Godot:Godot:\nYou know as well as I do that the medication is irrelevant. It hardly seems likely that a prescription drug would contain potassium cyanide.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nIt hardly seems likely that the coffee the waitress served would contain it, either! But it did! The possibility is undeniable!Godot:\nAaargh!Judge:\nThat's enough. Mr. Godot. Is the detective the only witness the prosecution wishes to call?Godot:\n...Judge:\nMr. Godot...?Godot:\n...Gumshoe:\nUm... I, ah... I've got my own witness I'd like to call, sir. It's the old man who was there in the restaurant on the day of the murder.Phoenix:\n(Victor Kudo? The pigeon-hater?)Judge:\nVery well. The matter of the disappearing medication seems little more than trivial at best. However! It wasn't explored at all in the previous trial. And that is something that bothers me.Maya:\nYay! Good job, Nick!Judge:\nThe court will adjourn for a 10 minute recess. After which we will hear the prosecution's next witness.Godot:\nHa...! I suppose this means I'll just have to finish you off in my last 6 cups.Judge:\nCourt is adjourned for recess!January 7, 11:03 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Maya:\nPhew! That was close!Phoenix:\nTell me about it... I nearly died in there!Byrde:\nThat's my line, sir!Maya:\nNo! It's my line! I think I really did die a little bit.Byrde:\nLooks like we all nearly died in there... I can't believe Detective Gumshoe! How could he betray us like that!?Maya:\nHuh?Byrde:\nHe said he'd help me. But he totally set me up!Phoenix:\nI don't think he meant to do that, Maggey. He was backed into a corner. I mean, the guy's got to do his job, right?Byrde:\nIt's OK. I know all about lies and betrayal. I've had them my whole life. But it really hurt this time. It felt like someone punched me hard in the stomach! I hate that guy! I don't ever want to see him again!Phoenix:\n(Poor Gumshoe...)Maya:\nSo the next witness is going to be that old guy from the park, right?Phoenix:\nYeah. Mr. Kudo. Lover of waitress outfits and projectile seeds!Byrde:\nI bet he's gonna be really stubborn. I mean, he's pretty set in his ways, you know?Maya:\nYeah, he's a big old grouch. Are you going to be able to handle him, Nick?Phoenix:\nYeah, I can take whatever he throws at me. Even those never-ending bird seeds!January 7, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:\nCourt will now reconvene for the trial of Maggey Byrde. Mr. Godot. Your next witness, please.Godot:\nThe prosecution calls the lucky old-timer who caught the show over a cup of coffee. Will the witness please take the stand.Godot:\nName and occupation, if you don't mind.Kudo:\nThe name is Victor Kudo. Born and bred in the Land of the Rising Sun! Honor and duty are what make me. Mind you, I can be quite emotional at times, too.Phoenix:\nWe don't need to hear about that, Mr. Kudo. Just tell the court your occupation.Kudo:\nMy occupation? Kah! Listen, young'un! How much call d'you think there is for kimono embroidery here!?Phoenix:\nKimono embroidery?Kudo:\nThat's what I do! Or did, back in Japan. I embroidered family crests on kimonos! My ancestors were embroidering kimonos before this country even existed!Maya:\nWow, a real craftsman! They're a dying breed! Hey! Maybe he could embroider my costume sometime.Kudo:\nAnyway, like I said. There's not much demand for that kind of thing here. So I had to take a job working the cash register at a burger joint... pretending to smile!Phoenix:\n(That burger joint would've been better off putting him in the kitchen...)Judge:\nNow then, witness. Were you in the restaurant at the time of the incident?Kudo:\nOh, yes! I was eating some seeds over a cup of javaccino.Judge:\nSeeds?Kudo:\nWhat do you think these are, hmm!?Judge:\nI-I see...Godot:\nSo you saw everything that happened, gramps?Kudo:\nDid I!? Oh, yes! Oh, yes I did! I saw it all!Godot:\nThen please, tell the court. We're all ears.Kudo:\nSure, sure. I'll tell you. I'll tell you every last detail!Phoenix:\n(He's really getting into this...)Witness Testimony-- What I Witnessed --Kudo:\nThe young man was reading the sports paper.\nThe serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it!\nThe man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed.\nThat's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well!Judge:\nMr. Kudo. she is not a \"serving girl\". Please refer to her as a waitress.Kudo:\nKah! You're as bad as the rest of them! All these newfangled words! What's wrong with old-fashioned ones, hmm!?Judge:\nN-Newfangled?Kudo:\nAll this talk of \"radios\" and \"glasses\"! It's \"wireless\" and \"spectacles\", I tell you!Judge:\nE-Excuse me...Kudo:\nListen to me, everyone! Don't forget the old values! Don't let the good old days slip away!Judge:\nWell, um... I think it's time to begin the cross-examination, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor.Cross Examination-- What I Witnessed --Kudo:\nThe young man was reading the sports paper.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you saw the victim, then? You saw Mr. Glen Elg?\nKudo:\nI wanted to know if Gusten Brawn retained his championship or not.\nPhoenix:\n(So he was looking at the sports paper the victim was reading, huh...) And at the location in question... ...there are partitions between tables on the same side of the restaurant, right?\nKudo:\nSo what if there are?\nPhoenix:\nIf you say that you could see the victim... ...that means you were sitting at a table on the other side of the restaurant, correct?\nKudo:\nKah! I go to that place to drink javaccino! I don't go to sit! I don't remember what table I was sitting at!\nPhoenix:\n(You mean you go there to eye the waitress!)Kudo:\nThe serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. Kudo. That is a very grave accusation. Are you sure about what you saw?\nKudo:\nVictor Kudo never makes mistakes! I dot every t and cross every i!\nPhoenix:\nI see...\nKudo:\nMy eyesight's fine. The doctor said I only need spectacles for reading and driving.\nPhoenix:\n(...I bet his eyes are only really \"fine\" when he's scoping out a waitress.)\nKudo:\nAnd I saw what the serving girl put into the javaccino as well!\nPhoenix:\n(I bet I know what's coming up and something tells me I'm not going to like it...)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(It'd be dangerous to press this too much. I'd better ignore it for now.) So, what happened next?\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor. We need more clarification on what was put into the victim's coffee. I'd like to ask that the witness add what he knows about this to his testimony.\nJudge:\nHmm... I agree. Witness, will you enlighten us, please?\nKudo:\nSure, sure.\nAdds statement \"There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there.\"Press (after adding statement \"There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there.\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. Kudo. That is a very grave accusation. Are you sure about what you saw?\nKudo:\nVictor Kudo never makes mistakes! I dot every t and cross every i!\nPhoenix:\nI see...\nKudo:\nMy eyesight's fine. The doctor said I only need spectacles for reading and driving.\nPhoenix:\n(...I bet his eyes are only really \"fine\" when he's scoping out a waitress.)\nKudo:\nAnd I saw what the serving girl put into the javaccino as well!Kudo:\nThere's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nD-Did she really put that into the coffee?\nKudo:\nYou doubt me, boy!? She too some out of a small, brown bottle and sprinkled it in.\nPhoenix:\nCouldn't she have been adding sugar?\nKudo:\nSugar!? In a small, brown bottle like that!?\nJudge:\n\"Like that\"? Witness, could you please describe the bottle in more concrete terms?\nGodot:\nHa...! A bottle like this, perhaps?\nKudo:\nOh, there it is! That's the one!\nJudge:\nThat's the bottle of potassium cyanide, I presume?\nGodot:\nSo what did the accused put into the coffee? I think it's clear, don't you?\nPhoenix:\nArgh...Kudo:\nThe man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHe took just one sip?\nKudo:\nYou young'uns! You waste everything! Those javaccinos cost 8 dollars! In the good old days, we would have drank every last drop, eaten the cup, and then died!\nPhoenix:\n(Congratulations. You have earned the title of Battiest Man To Grace A Courtroom.)\nGodot:\nSo it was an immediate death? Well, with potassium cyanide, I suppose that is possible.\nKudo:\nOh, yes. He slumped over without so much as a twitch! I felt the javaccino I'd just drank turn sour in my stomach.\nGodot:\nOh, yes. I know that feeling.\nJudge:\nAnd the waitress? I presume she is...?Kudo:\nThat's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou said, \"I remember her well\" in reference to the waitress... Did she have any particular features that you can identify her by?\nKudo:\nParticular features!? It's a disgrace, that's what it is!\nPhoenix:\nSorry?\nKudo:\nYou can see all the way up to her... her... You know! She's practically naked in that uniform!\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo the particular feature you recognize about the waitress is... her outfit!? But anyone could wear just such an [sic] uniform! Even me!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Please spare the court of any further mental anguish from that image.\nMaya:\nDon't get all excited, Nick! You've gotta keep yourself together!\nPhoenix:\n(I-I guess I got a bit carried away...)\nKudo:\nKah! There are other things I recognize about her, too.\nPhoenix:\n(He seems pretty sure of himself. What should I do?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(There's got to be a better line of attack than this. That's what I should be looking for now...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSure, you saw a waitress take the coffee over to the victim. But what matters is whether that waitress was Maggey Byrde or not.\nJudge:\nQuite right. Mr. Kudo. These other \"features\" that you recognize about the defendant... I would ask you to add them to your testimony.\nKudo:\nSure, sure.\nAdds statement \"There was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose.\"Press (after adding statement \"There was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose.\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou said, \"I remember her well\" in reference to the waitress... Did she have any particular features that you can identify her by?\nKudo:\nParticular features!? It's a disgrace, that's what it is!\nPhoenix:\nSorry?\nKudo:\nYou can see all the way up to her... her... You know! She's practically naked in that uniform!\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo the particular feature you recognize about the waitress is... her outfit!? But anyone could wear just such an [sic] uniform!

You've gotta keep yourself together!\nPhoenix:\n(I-I guess I got a bit carried away...)\nKudo:\nKah! There are other things I recognize about her, too.Kudo:\nThere was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou do seem to remember several details about her appearance. But what about the most crucial detail of all... her face?\nKudo:\nKah! As if I wouldn't remember that!\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nThe witness noticed the straps on the accused's apron. He'd unlikely to make a mistake about her face.\nKudo:\nThat's right! I can even tell you the color of the ribbon in her hair. It was red!\nGodot:\nSo you see, there's nothing wrong with the witness's eyesight.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\n(There's no doubt he remembers the waitress pretty well. What should I do? I get the feeling there's something more to this somehow...)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, I must be imagining it. I need to find another angle with this guy.)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nAsk about the straps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. Kudo. You seem especially interested in straps. Why is that?\nKudo:\nWh-What?\nPhoenix:\nThe ribbon in her hair, the straps on her apron. What's the fascination?\nKudo:\nF-Fascination?\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nPeople have all kinds of fetishes, Trite. We don't need to embarrass the witness.\nKudo:\nListen, you young upstarts! I haven't got some sick strap fetish!\nJudge:\nHmm... Is there any relevance to the witness's unusual love of straps, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nI was just curious as to why he was so fixated on the waitress's straps...\nKudo:\nI said I haven't got a strap fetish! How many times do I have to repeat myself!?\nJudge:\nVery well. Continue with your testimony, Mr. Kudo. And make it strapless.\nKudo:\n*grumble grumble*\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nAsk about the waitress's back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe identifying \"features\" you described are all things you would see from the back.\nKudo:\nSo what?\nPhoenix:\nIs it possible that... ...you never saw the waitress from the front at all!?\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHa...! He's got you there, gramps!\nPhoenix:\nPeople normally talk about facial features when they're asked to describe someone. But this witness's testimony is nothing but straps and ribbons!\nKudo:\nTh-This is harassment! I tell you I'm not obsessed with straps or ribbons! I'm just telling you what I saw!\nJudge:\nMr. Kudo, the court requests that you add details about any identifying features... Features you observed from the front, that is, to your testimony.\nKudo:\nSure, sure.\nMaya:\nThe old man's testimony is getting longer and longer!\nPhoenix:\nAnd if I can't find a hole in it soon, it'll get even longer, I bet.\nAdds statement \"There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front.\"Press (after adding statement \"There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front.\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou do seem to remember several details about her appearance. But what about the most crucial detail of all... her face?\nKudo:\nKah! As if I wouldn't remember that!\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nThe witness noticed the straps on the accused's apron. He'd unlikely to make a mistake about her face.\nKudo:\nThat's right! I can even tell you the color of the ribbon in her hair. It was red!\nGodot:\nSo you see, there's nothing wrong with the witness's eyesight.\nJudge:\nHmm...Kudo:\nThere wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou didn't find anything to be distinct, but you did clearly see the witness's face, yes?\nKudo:\nNo question about it! I didn't come this far to back down now! Victor Kudo never backs down!\nPhoenix:\n(That's not the answer I was looking for, but OK...)\nMaya:\nThis has turned into a matter of pride for Old Seedy now, I guess... I wonder if he really did see Maggey's face or not...\nPhoenix:\n(Like I thought, we need some concrete proof of this. Proof that the old guy didn't see the waitress clearly from the front.)Present Apron\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Kudo. I would like you to please take a look at this.\"Maya:\nDo you think Old Seedy really saw Maggey do it?Phoenix:\nWell, he probably had his eye on the waitress the whole time. That's why he was there.Maya:\nBut he was there for the cute outfits, right? Not the waitress...Phoenix:\nI-I guess... (Hmm, she makes a good point though...)Maya:\nHey! Did I just say something clever?Phoenix:\nI wonder if the waitress Mr. Kudo saw really was Maggey...Maya:\nThat's what we have to figure out, Nick!Phoenix:\nMr. Kudo. I would like you to please take a look at this.Kudo:\nKah! That filthy thing would suit filth like you just perfectly. Actually, it reminds me of what my grandson looks like, just after he's done eating.Phoenix:\nHave you ever seen this before?Kudo:\nOf course I haven't! Do you think I'd forget something as dirty as that!? Hmm? Well? You half-witted clot!?Phoenix:\n...Judge:\n............Kudo:\nWh-What!? What is it!? Ever since I said, \"you half-witted clot\", there's been an eerie silence in here.Phoenix:\nMr. Kudo. This apron... ...is the apron worn by the defendant on the day of the poisoning!Kudo:\nUh?Phoenix:\nAnd as you just said yourself... ...you wouldn't forget something like this. Which means, is you had really seen this apron before...Kudo:\nEr...Phoenix:\nYes, you know what I'm getting at! You couldn't have possibly seen the waitress from the front!Kudo:\n... Oops!Judge:\nWitness! You can't just \"oops\" your way out of this!Godot:\nHa...! Well, well... Looks like we finally have a genuine trial on our hands.Phoenix:\n...Godot:\nListen, Trite. Here are the facts. On the day of the incident, there was only one waitress in the restaurant.Judge:\nThat being the defendant, Ms. Maggey Byrde?Godot:\nExactly. And when that one waitress put the poison into the coffee cup... ...this old guy was watching!Judge:\nHmm... I hope you understand the gravity of the situation, Mr. Kudo. The fate of the defendant may rest on what you say you remember seeing.Godot:\nJust tell the court exactly what you saw, gramps.Kudo:\nYou can rely on me, Captain! My noggin's in perfect working order. I can't remember a single occasion when I forgot what burger a customer wanted!Maya:\nHe can't remember? Probably more like he messes up so many times, he's blocking it out...Judge:\nVery well. Let's test just how good your memory and attention to detail is, Mr. Kudo. Tell us what you remember about the victim.Witness Testimony-- About the Victim --Kudo:\nHe was another of those pesky young types, wearing a broken pair of spectacles.\nHe had a newspaper in his right hand, and the noisy brat kept rustling its pages!\nThe young man was listening to the wireless. I remember that well.\nThen the serving girl in question brought over the javaccino.\nThe little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip.Judge:\nThe testimony we have just heard was to test how credible the witness's memory is. It seems to me that he remembers the victim in a great deal of detail.Kudo:\nOh, yes! I hate those you-know-what types who are so vague about everything!Maya:\nHow are we going to handle this, Nick?Phoenix:\nWe only need to do one thing. We just need to prove that the old man's memory is shot.Maya:\nJust trip him up, you mean? Isn't that kind of cruel?Phoenix:\n(I suppose... But it's what I do best.)Cross Examination-- About the Victim --Kudo:\nHe was another of those pesky young types, wearing a broken pair of spectacles.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSpectacles?\nKudo:\nDark glasses to you! One of the lenses was green, but the other was broken. Newfangled rubbish! That's why I remember him so well.\nPhoenix:\n(He did have some kind of lens over his left eye... But I wouldn't have called it a pair of glasses.)\nJudge:\nHmm... He seems to have been wearing some rather modern-looking shades. Perhaps I should take to wearing some, and rival Mr. Godot's sharp appearance.\nMaya:\nAh! We better come up with something sharp, and quick!\nPhoenix:\n(Guess I'll wait and see if I should challenge him about the \"spectacles\"...)Kudo:\nHe had a newspaper in his right hand, and the noisy brat kept rustling its pages!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe newspaper was a sports paper, was it?\nKudo:\nThat young hooligan! I nearly asked him, \"Can't you even read without fidgeting, hmm!?\" How was I supposed to be able to read the back page with all that rustling going on!? I needed to find out if Gusten Brawn retained his championship title!\nPhoenix:\n(It was his paper, not yours! If you wanted to know so bad, why didn't you buy your own!?)\nKudo:\nWhat are looking [sic] at me like that for, hmm!? How dare you judge me!\nPhoenix:\nOw! Ooow!\nMaya:\nGusten Brawn got beaten yesterday, by the way. Anyway...Kudo:\nThe young man was listening to the wireless. I remember that well.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe wireless?\nKudo:\nThe decadent young rascal! In my day, it was one or the other! Read the paper, or listen to the wireless!\nPhoenix:\n(...Oh boy.)\nKudo:\nAnd using an earpiece! It's selfish, that's what it is! I was straining my ears, but I couldn't catch any of it.\nPhoenix:\n(Was he that desperate to listen to the radio...?)\nKudo:\nWhat are looking [sic] at me like that for, hmm!? 2 you feel sorry for me!\nPhoenix:\nOw! Oooow!Kudo:\nThen the serving girl in question brought over the javaccino.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou mean the waitress, who you only saw from behind, right?\nKudo:\nYou're one of those, are you? You never let anything go, isn't that right?\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe.\nKudo:\nWhat does it matter if I saw her from the front or from behind!? My eyes don't lie!\nPhoenix:\nOw! Oooow! (I better not push it until I've got some hard evidence.)Kudo:\nThe little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n\"His free hand\"?\nKudo:\nYes.\nPhoenix:\nWhich hand was that?\nKudo:\nWeren't you listening before, cloth-ears!? I said he was rustling the newspaper with his right hand, didn't I? If his free hand wasn't his right hand, then which hand was it, you moron!\nPhoenix:\nOw! Oooow!\nGodot:\nHa...! Perhaps the great Mr. Trite has three hands!\nPhoenix:\n(Yeesh! I was only asking! No need to gang up on me and treat me like a freak!)Present Coffee Cup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"Mr. Kudo. Do you remember what you were told at the start of this testimony?\"Phoenix:\n(The whole point of this cross-examination is to establish just one thing... That this old guy's memory has more holes than a slice of Swiss.)Maya:\nI guess we just need to find a contradiction in his testimony somewhere, huh?Phoenix:\n(Anything will do. Even the smallest detail. We just need one mistake, and he's ours!)Phoenix:\nMr. Kudo. Do you remember what you were told at the start of this testimony? That this was a way of testing the credibility of your memory?Kudo:\nI know, I know! There's nothing wrong with my memory, I tell you! Nothing! If I got anything wrong, I'll eat these seeds and sing the pigeon song!Godot:\nCare to tell us where this is going, Trite?Phoenix:\nAccording to Mr. Kudo, the victim was holding the paper in his right hand... ...while drinking coffee with his free hand, which would make that his left.Kudo:\nKah! What is this? Kindergarten?Phoenix:\nBut I would like the court to please take a look at this.Judge:\nThat's the cup victim used, correct?Phoenix:\nYes, and on the rim, you'll notice the mark left by the victim's lips.Judge:\nYes. There is a stain left by the coffee.Phoenix:\nIf you consider where that stain is, you'll clearly see... ...that the victim was holding the cup in his right hand!Kudo:\nBut how...?Phoenix:\nWell, Mr. Kudo. The court is waiting for your epic performance! You said you'd eat those seeds and sing the pigeon song!Kudo:\nAaaargh!Judge:\nMr. Kudo... I'm afraid this is simply not acceptable. I think the witness had better go back to the park where he came from.Kudo:\nWAAAAIT! If you think I'm going to stand here and listen to you tell me I'm mad, you're wrong! I don't care about that dirty coffee cup! I know what I saw!Judge:\nY-You still insist on your testimony?Kudo:\nThat young brat was holding the cup in his left hand! Oh, yes. No question! I'm a good, law-abiding citizen, I am. It's that dead young hotbot and you, you spikey-haired yahoo, who are at fault!Phoenix:\n(Who, me!?)Judge:\nTh-Thank you, old man. We've heard quite enough from you already.Kudo:\nDon't call me \"old man\", old man! Been around for 68 years, I have. You can't ignore me! LISTEN TO WHAT I'VE GOT TO SAAAAY!Judge:\nI'm sorry, Mr. Kudo, but...Godot:\nSure, why not hear a little more?Judge:\nM-Mr. Godot!Godot:\nBut this is my 16th cup of coffee... So this is your final stand.Kudo:\nThank you, Captain! You can rely on Victor!Witness Testimony-- Left Hand or Right Hand --Kudo:\nThe boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs.\nHe kept fiddling with it all the time.\nHe was fiddling with it just before he picked up the cup, too.\nAnd then he used the same hand to pick up the cup. His left hand!Judge:\nWe know that the victim was wearing an unusual monocle over his left eye.Godot:\nIt wasn't a monocle, Your Honor. It was a small computer monitor often used by programmers.Judge:\nA monitor? You mean, like a television screen!?Godot:\nThe inside of the lens is a screen that displays computer data. It's called an HMD. It's a common tool in the victim's line of work.Kudo:\nHDTV, DVD, CD... All these newfangled letters drive me mad! But they don't matter. I know what I saw, and I'm telling the truth!Phoenix:\n(It's true... He doesn't seem to be lying.)Kudo:\nAnd those are the facts, in good old black and white!Cross Examination-- Left Hand or Right Hand --Kudo:\nThe boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo the victim was wearing an HMD.\nKudo:\nHDTV, CD, DVD... What does it matter!?\nPhoenix:\n(It was none of them actually, but anyway...) And you're sure that he was wearing the earpiece on the same side?\nKudo:\nNo question! I could only see that side of his head from where I was sitting.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah. That's pretty obvious if you look at the floor plans. From the opposite table, he'd only have a view of the side of the victim's head.)Present Victim's Prescription Bag or Glen Elg profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n\"I'm not sure what the relevance of this is, but...\"Kudo:\nHe kept fiddling with it all the time.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nIt seems you kept an eye on Mr. Glen Elg.\nKudo:\nHe was getting on my nerves! Rustling that newspaper and fiddling with his earpiece all the time! And then he went and made all that fuss dying from one sip of javaccino! I wanted to say to him, \"Calm down, you young brat!\" Just looking at him made me suddenly speed up my seed eating! I could've chocked!\nPhoenix:\n(So I take it the victim was a walking ball of nervous energy...)Kudo:\nHe was fiddling with it just before he picked up the cup, too.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe earpiece you mentioned... Which hand did the victim touch it with?\nKudo:\n... You're one of those people! One of those people who uses his left hand to get things out of his right pocket. Or fastens his left cuff with his right hand? And when the tour guide says, \"On your right side, you'll see the famous blah-blah\"... ...you're the only one who deliberately looks left! Well? Aren't you?\nPhoenix:\nN-No! I didn't mean...\nKudo:\nObviously he used the hand on the same side of his body that the earpiece was in!\nPhoenix:\nOw! Oooow! Ow! (So, if he had the HMD on his left side, then it was his left hand, I guess...)Kudo:\nAnd then he used the same hand to pick up the cup. His left hand!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou seem very sure of yourself, Mr. Kudo.\nKudo:\nThat's because I know what I saw, no matter what tricks you try to play on me!\nPhoenix:\n(It looks like he really did see the guy picking the cup up with his left hand. This is a dead end!)Maya:\nWell, Nick? What do you think?Phoenix:\nI think the guy's telling the truth. But even so... Something's not quite right.Maya:\nThen chuck evidence at him until he breaks!Phoenix:\n(But if he's not lying, there wouldn't be any contradictions in his testimony, right?)Phoenix:\nI'm not sure what the relevance of this is, but... Mr. Kudo! There is something very strange about your observations of the victim.Kudo:\nWhat!?Phoenix:\nYou say he was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the HMD.Kudo:\nNo question! You can lock me up if I'm wrong! It was his left ear, without a doubt! I could only see that side of his head from where I was sitting.Phoenix:\nI don't think so.Kudo:\nWh-What did you say!?Phoenix:\nYou're no doubt unaware of this fact, Mr. Kudo. But the victim couldn't hear with his left ear! His eardrum was ruptured!Kudo:\nEh?Phoenix:\nTraces of medication for his condition were found in his ear canal. That's right! It's impossible that the victim was wearing his earpiece in his left ear. Because he couldn't even hear in that ear!Kudo:\n... Is that true, Captain?Godot:\n...It is.Kudo:\n...Pi... Pi-Pi-Pigeon! Hm-hm-hmm... Pretty pigeon! Hm-hm-hmm...Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order!Phoenix:\nThis witness's testimony is completely unreliable! He only saw the witness from behind. And he claims the victim was wearing an earpiece when we know his eardrum was ruptured! Well, Mr. Godot!?Godot:\nAaaargh! A single drop of milk is all it takes to destroy the pure black magic in the cup! The old man... ...is my drop of milk!Kudo:\nCaptain! Are you calling me a drip!?Judge:\nThis is the victim's coffee cup in which the potassium cyanide was found. The mark on the rim clearly shows that the victim picked it up with his right hand!Kudo:\nI'll never back down! I know I'm right! The lad drank his javaccino with his left hand!Godot:\nLet me put you out of your misery... Clearly, the victim used both hands. He took a sip with the cup held in his right hand, and then switched to his left... That's what the old man saw!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nImpossible! The witness has already testified on numerous occasions... ...that the victim died immediately after taking just one sip of the coffee.Godot:Godot:\nWhich hand the victim used to pick up his cup is irrelevant, Your Honor. The facts still stand! With one hand or the other, Mr. Elg drank the poisoned coffee... ...Like this!Phoenix:Phoenix:\nSadly, Mr. Godot, that doesn't wash! The point of this testimony was to establish whether the witness's memory was credible. And the results are clear! The testimony given by this witness is useless!Godot:\nPuuuurgh!Judge:\nI believe it is time to conclude today's proceedings. I am satisfied that the witness is not deceiving the court. But to be frank, his testimony is a farce!Kudo:\nD-Did you have to be so frank!? Take that, you pompous old fogey!Judge:\nI'm sorry, Mr. Kudo. You can't reach me from there. I'm ordering the defense and the prosecution to investigate this case further. That is all for now. This court is adjourned!???:Kudo:\nWAAAAIT! If we stop now, where does that leave me?Judge:\nLeave you, Mr. Kudo?Kudo:\nThanks to that blue-suited young upstart over there... ...I'm just a bumbling old man who can't even dot his t's or cross his i's now!Phoenix:\n(How is your bad memory my fault!?)Judge:\nI'm sorry, Mr. Kudo, but there's nothing I can do.Kudo:\nI've kept my mouth shut until now... ...but there's something else the court should know!Godot:\nWhat!?Phoenix:\nThere's more?Kudo:\nTo be perfectly honest, it might not be anything. But I want another chance! I want another crack at you, you young shark!Phoenix:\nM-Me? (He's looking at me like I'm some sort of evil Shogun...)Kudo:\nWell, everyone? What do you say to one final showdown? The final chapter in this eccentric old man's scrapbook!Godot:\nSorry, gramps... I've already had my 17th cup of coffee.Kudo:\nWhat have you got to lose, Captain? I'll give you all the javaccino you want if you come to my house after the trial. (Changed from [I'll give you all the coffee you want if you come to my house after the trial.] in the original release) I may be 68 years old, but Victor Kudo is still a man!Judge:\nThat's enough, witness. I believe it will be quicker for the court to just hear your testimony.Kudo:\nYou bet! Much, much quicker!Maya:\nI can't believe this is happening...Kudo:\nHa ha ha! You better get ready, youngster!Phoenix:\nI get the picture! Just quit throwing those seeds at me, would you!?

He knocked it right over.\nIt broke, and the strip of cloth covering the table got completely soaked!\nWell!? How about that? Turned things upside-down, hmm?Judge:\n... Um... Is that all?Kudo:\nYes, that's all. I remember it perfectly. Eh!? You're doubting me again? You're doubting a poor, defenseless old man!?Judge:\nN-No. We are not doubting you, Mr. Kudo.Maya:\nDon't you get the feeling there's a question hanging on everyone's lips, Nick?Phoenix:\nYeah. \"So what?\" probably! That's all I can think of, and I have to cross-examine this guy!Kudo:\nYou're a birdbrain, that's why that's all you can think of!Judge:\nVery well... Mr. Wright.

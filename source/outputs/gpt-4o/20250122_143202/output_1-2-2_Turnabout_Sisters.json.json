    "response": "To find a contradiction in Detective Gumshoe's testimony, we need to carefully evaluate each statement against the evidence. Let's review the relevant parts of the testimony and the evidence:\n\n1. Witness Testimony Statements:\n   - \"I found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!\"\n   - \"On it, the word 'Maya' was written clearly in blood!\"\n   - \"Lab test results showed that the blood was the victim's!\"\n   - \"Also, there was blood found on the victim's finger!\"\n   - \"Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!\"\n\n2. Relevant Evidence:\n   - **Mia's Autopsy Report** (Evidence 5): This states that Mia's \"death was instantaneous,\" suggesting she couldn't have written anything before dying.\n\nLet's match the testimony with the evidence:\n\n- Testimony line \"Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!\" directly states that Mia wrote something before dying. However, according to the autopsy report, Mia died instantaneously, which would mean she did not have the time to write anything before dying. This creates a direct contradiction between the testimony and the evidence.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction exists in the claim that Mia wrote the name \"Maya.\" She couldn't have written anything if her death was instantaneous, as per Mia's Autopsy Report.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"present\",\n  \"testimony\": 5,\n  \"evidence\": 5\n}\n```"

    "response": "To find the contradiction in April May's testimony, let's analyze the claims she made and compare them against the evidence:\n\n1. **April May's Testimony:**\n   - She claims that she witnessed everything.\n   - She describes the victim dodging an attack and running to the right.\n   - She mentions the girl in hippie clothes (presumed to be Maya) chasing and attacking the victim.\n   - She identifies the weapon as \"The Thinker,\" describing it as a clock-like statue.\n\n2. **Relevant Pieces of Evidence:**\n   - **The Thinker (Evidence 1):** A statue that is actually a clock. The clock's gears have been removed, making it no longer functional as a clock.\n   - **Mia's Autopsy Report (Evidence 5):** Indicates that the victim's death was caused by blunt force trauma and that death may not have been instantaneous.\n\n3. **Contradiction Analysis:**\n   - In statement 4, May refers to the weapon as \"that clock\" and \"statue-y clock,\" implying it was both a clock and a statue. \n   - To most people, the fact that it's a clock is not immediately obvious unless they have prior knowledge of its function. This implies that April May knew the internal details of \"The Thinker,\" which a mere eyewitness should not have known unless she heard or was told about the clock feature.\n  \nHence, the contradiction is in how April May knows that the statue is a clock when the clock's gears have been removed and it's objectively a statue now. Therefore, we can present the evidence of \"The Thinker\" to challenge her knowledge of its clock component.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n```json\n{\"action\": \"present\", \"testimony\": 4, \"evidence\": 1}\n```"

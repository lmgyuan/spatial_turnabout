    "response": "To identify a contradiction in Frank Sahwit's testimony, we need to examine each statement in the context of the evidence provided. We should particularly focus on any statements where there might be conflicting information with the available evidence.\n\nLet's go through the provided testimony:\n\n1. \"I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.\"\n2. \"I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.\"\n3. \"Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.\"\n4. \"Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!\"\n5. \"I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.\"\n6. \"I thought to call the police immediately!\"\n7. \"However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.\"\n8. \"I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.\"\n9. \"I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.\"\n10. \"The man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.\"\n\nLooking at statement 9, Sahwit claims that he remembers the time exactly as 1:00 PM. However, the Cindy's Autopsy Report notes the time of death as being between 4 PM and 5 PM, which directly contradicts Sahwit's testimony that he saw the body at 1:00 PM.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction lies in statement 9 of the testimony and the evidence from Cindy's Autopsy Report. Let's present this evidence:\n\nFinal Answer:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"present\", \"testimony\": 9, \"evidence\": 1}\n```"

    "response": "To find the contradiction in the new testimony provided by Frank Sahwit, we need to examine his statements compared with the evidence.\n\n1. Sahwit\u2019s testimony states:\n   - When he found the body, he heard the time.\n   - There was a voice saying the time, probably from the television.\n   - But he realized it was three hours off.\n   - He guessed the victim must have been watching a videotaped program, making him think it was 1:00 PM.\n\n2. Relevant Evidence:\n   - Cindy's Autopsy Report states the time of death was between 4 PM and 5 PM.\n   - Blackout Record notes that electricity to the victim's building was out from noon to 6 PM on the day of the crime.\n\n3. Cross-Examination Analysis:\n   - Sahwit claimed to have heard the time from the TV; however, the Blackout Record shows electricity was off from noon to 6 PM, making it impossible for the TV to have been on.\n   - Therefore, any claim about the TV announcing the time at around 1 PM is suspicious, as the TV could not have been operating without electricity.\n\n4. Conclusion:\n   - The contradiction lies in Sahwit's claim about hearing the time from a television when the electricity was off at the purported time of 1 PM.\n   - Presenting the Blackout Record against the relevant testimony should expose this contradiction.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"present\",\n  \"testimony\": 1,\n  \"evidence\": 4\n}\n```"

    "response": "To identify the contradiction in this cross-examination, we need to carefully analyze the new testimony given by Frank Sahwit:\n\n1. **Testimony**: Sahwit claims he did not \"hear\" the time, but instead \"saw\" it.\n2. **Testimony**: He mentions a table clock in the apartment.\n3. **Testimony**: He insists that the clock was the murder weapon, which was used to hit the victim and that's where he saw the time.\n\nWe need to find an inconsistency between this testimony and the available evidence.\n\nNow, let's evaluate these claims against the evidence we have:\n\n- **Statue Evidence**: The evidence submitted in court describes the murder weapon as a statue in the shape of \"The Thinker\", which is rather heavy, not a table clock. The description does not mention it having any clock features.\n\nThe contradiction arises from the fact that Sahwit claims the murder weapon was a clock, but the evidence describes it purely as a statue. This indicates that he either has knowledge about the murder weapon that wasn't publicly available or he's lying about seeing it as a clock.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the correct action is to present the statue (Evidence 2) against the first statement where Sahwit claims he saw the \"table clock\".\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"present\",\n  \"testimony\": 0,\n  \"evidence\": 2\n}\n```"

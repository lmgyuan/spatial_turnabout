    "response": "Let's analyze Detective Gumshoe's testimony to identify a contradiction:\n\n1. Gumshoe claims to have secured the suspect and examined the crime scene.\n2. He mentions finding a memo with \"Maya\" written in blood.\n3. He asserts that the blood belonged to the victim.\n4. States there was blood found on the victim's finger.\n5. Concludes that before dying, the victim wrote the killer's name.\n\nThe critical point here is that Gumshoe asserts the victim wrote the killer's name before dying. However, let's check the evidence available:\n\n- **Mia's Autopsy Report**: This states that Mia died from a single blunt force trauma and suggests that death was instantaneous, negating the possibility of her writing anything before dying.\n\nThe contradiction lies between Gumshoe's assertion that Mia wrote Maya's name before she died and the autopsy report suggesting an instantaneous death, making it unlikely for Mia to have written anything post-attack. \n\nTherefore, we should present Mia's Autopsy Report against the statement in the testimony that talks about the victim writing the name before she died.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"present\",\n  \"testimony\": 5,\n  \"evidence\": 5\n}\n```"

    "response": "To find the contradiction in the witness's testimony, let's analyze it step by step:\n\n1. The witness, April May, claims she saw everything.\n2. She describes the victim dodging the first attack and running to the right.\n3. She then describes the girl in hippie clothes (Maya) running after the victim.\n4. The witness claims Maya hit the victim with a weapon.\n5. Finally, she identifies the weapon as a kind of clock, specifically \"The Thinker\" statue.\n\nNow, check the evidence that may contradict the witness's testimony:\n\n- The Thinker (Evidence 1): Described as looking like a statue but actually being a clock. It was made by Larry Butz. The important detail here is that the clock's gears have been removed, meaning it no longer functions as a clock.\n\nBased on April May's testimony, she identified the murder weapon as a \"kinda statue-y clock,\" which implies it functioned as a clock, or she could hear the sound or tell time. However, the evidence shows that the gears of the clock have been removed, making it not functioning as a clock, thus revealing a contradiction in her testimony.\n\nAction: Present the evidence (The Thinker, evidence number 1) against testimony statement 4 or 5.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"present\",\n  \"testimony\": 4,\n  \"evidence\": 1\n}\n```"

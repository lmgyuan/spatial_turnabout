Part 6Episode 4Turnabout GoodbyesIt's been, what, 15 years?About that, yes.15 years is a long time to wait... You can't imagine how much I've suffered...You... suffered?And now... the perfect opportunity presents itself. At last... I shall have my revenge!What!?...Merry Christmas.December 25, 10:08 AMWright & Co. Law OfficesMaya:
Hey, hey, Nick! Do you know if there's any good waterfalls around here?Phoenix:
Waterfalls...? Dare I ask why?Maya:
Duh, Nick! Isn't it obvious? I need a waterfall to stand under! Preferably a freezing one!Phoenix:
... Oh... Is that part of your spirit medium training?Maya:
Of course! Except, I've been slacking off lately... I need to brave the elements and be forged anew under the rushing spring waters!Phoenix:
Umm... Okay... I don't know about any falls per se, but Gourd Lake is pretty close...Maya:
Oh. Darn.Phoenix:
Sorry, but them's the breaks. Couldn't you just take a cold shower or something?Maya:
... Good idea!Phoenix:
(So much for the rushing spring waters...)TV:
Next in the news... A large, unidentified animal was sighted at Gourd Lake! The town is buzzing with excitement! Locals are calling it "Gourdy" in a tip of the hat to Nessie, the Loch Ness monster. Though its namesake, Nessie, proved to be a hoax... locals are confident their Gourdy is the real deal. ...Phoenix:
*yawn* Bor-ing. Can't they show real news for a change?Maya:
Nick?Phoenix:
?Maya:
The water pressure's kind of low in that shower.Phoenix:
... You want more pressure, huh? Why don't you go down to the fire department and have them spray you with the hose?Maya:
... Good idea, Nick!Phoenix:
(Apparently, Fey blood is no aid in detecting sarcasm...) (Changed from [Apparently, E.S.P. is no aid in detecting sarcasm...] in the original release)TV:
We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin! Strange occurrences continue at Gourd Lake... But this time, it's murder!Phoenix:
(Gourd Lake again?)TV:
The body of a man was found in the lake early this morning. A suspect was apprehended. Sources inside the police department revealed... that the suspect's name is Miles Edgeworth, age 24. Edgeworth was an up-and-coming prosecution attorney, known for his skill and connections. He was guaranteed a long and rewarding career... Has he thrown it all away?Phoenix:
(...? E-Edgeworth!?) What's going on!? Edgeworth would never do something like--Maya:
Nick?Phoenix:
Yipes! M-Maya!Maya:
The fireman yelled at me when I called him.Phoenix:
We've got bigger things to worry about than that! They arrested Edgeworth!Maya:
What? You mean, the prosecutor?Phoenix:
Yeah, he's a suspect... in a murder!Maya:
Whaaaaat!? When? Where? Whom? Why? How?Phoenix:
I-I don't know!Maya:
Let's go find out, Nick!Examine









Bookshelf







Phoenix:
Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. I tried reading one, and it made my head hurt. When I closed it, it slipped out of my hand. Then my foot hurt too.




Charley the plant







Phoenix:
Mia's favorite plant. Its name is "Charley." Maya's gotten the knack of watering it lately. Charley's been perking up these days.




Desk







Phoenix:
Mia's desk. If we had more clients, I would probably sit here more often. Lately, I've been spending more time on the couch, watching TV.




Movie poster







Phoenix:
Maya brought in a poster of the Steel Samurai the other day. We had a big fight over whether to put it up or not. I know she's just waiting for a chance to sneak it up on the wall.




Window







Phoenix:
Looks like it's cleaning day again at the hotel across the way. I hear they're planning a second branch outside the city. I can see the bellboy, getting the angle of that screwdriver in the drawer just right.Talk









What to do







Phoenix:
Well, what should we do?
Maya:
What do you mean!? Let's investigate! We should talk to Mr. Edgeworth, and check out the crime scene!
Phoenix:
(You're right... We need more information! Save aimlessness and confusion for later!)




Any ideas







Phoenix:
Well? Got any good ideas?
Maya:
Not really. I do my best thinking when I'm standing underneath a waterfall.Present









Attorney's Badge







Phoenix:
You know, I think it's developing a nice luster.
Maya:
I'll look at your badge later, Nick. We've got work to do!
Phoenix:
(I suppose you're right...)December 25Detention CenterVisitor's RoomMaya:
You know, Nick... We've all been in here one time or another, haven't we?Phoenix:
I guess it comes with the territory.Maya:
I'm not sure it's something we should mention to too many people... Aah!Phoenix:
... Hey! Edgeworth! Come back!Edgeworth:
What are you doing here!?Maya:
Nick, I don't think he's in a very good mood.Phoenix:
Well, he is in detention. Were you in a good mood when you were here?Edgeworth:
So, you've come to laugh at the fallen attorney? Then laugh, laugh! Well? Why aren't you laughing?Maya:
Nick... Should we be laughing?Phoenix:
Nah. It's a trick. Laugh and he'll get mad... or burst into tears. Edgeworth. We don't have so much free time we can spend it coming down here to laugh at you.Edgeworth:
... Yes you do.Phoenix:
(Actually, he's right.)Edgeworth:
... I hoped you wouldn't come. I didn't want you to see me. Not like this.Phoenix:
(I didn't want to see you like this, either. Believe me.) (Changed from [Hey, I didn't want to see you either, believe me.] in the original release)Examine









Surveillance camera







Phoenix:
Smile for the camera...




Security guard







Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch since I came in. A real pro. Or maybe he's just nervous with Edgeworth in the room.Talk









What happened







Phoenix:
Edgeworth. Tell me what happened.
Edgeworth:
... Why should I? What are you going to do about it?
Maya:
Duh! We're going to help you, that's what!
Edgeworth:
...! ... Help me? You? Don't be ridiculous.
Phoenix:
Sorry...?
Edgeworth:
You're a novice! You've only been in three trials!
Phoenix:
H-hey!
Edgeworth:
Sure, you got lucky and won all three... But your luck's bound to run out some day! You need real skill, Wright. Experience!
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
Nick! He's insulting you! Nick? Why am I always the one who has to get angry!?




Gourd Lake







Phoenix:
The murder took place at Gourd Lake, correct?
Edgeworth:
Yes... late last night.
Phoenix:
The lake is a long way away from your offices and the court... Why were you down there?
Edgeworth:
... I see no need to tell you.
Maya:
M-Mr. Edgeworth! You... you didn't really...?
Edgeworth:
... Gourdy.
Maya:
Huh?
Edgeworth:
I went to see Gourdy.
Maya:
"Gourdy"? What's that!?
Phoenix:
I'll... tell you later. (Why won't Edgeworth talk to us?)




Did you do it (appears after "What happened", "Gourd Lake", and presenting Attorney's Badge)







Phoenix:
Edgeworth... this is really hard for me to ask... But... you didn't do it, right? Right?
Edgeworth:
... Think what you will. I have only one request.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Edgeworth:
Stay out of this case.
Maya:
Why!? B-but Nick is trying to help you!
Edgeworth:
I know...! I know that! But I don't want your help, okay?
Maya:



Why not?
Edgeworth:
... Look, just go away, and leave me alone!
Maya:
Nick... Mr. Edgeworth did it, didn't he.
Phoenix:
Maya! Let's go investigate elsewhere.
Maya:
But, Nick...Present









Attorney's Badge







Edgeworth:
Your attorney's badge...?
Phoenix:
Edgeworth. Let me defend you.
Edgeworth:
... Hah! Hah hah! Good one, Wright. But I'm not that hard up. Not yet.
Maya:
Wh-what do you mean by that?
Edgeworth:
Me? Trust a wet-behind-the-ears lawyer with only three trials under his belt? Never!
Maya:
Wh-what!?
Edgeworth:
My case is near hopeless, Wright. Every defense attorney I've talked to has turned me down.
Phoenix:
What?
Edgeworth:
Simply put, they were afraid they'd lose. It occurred to me that it might be my fault that they lack confidence. After all, I did get every single one of their clients declared "guilty."
Phoenix:
I don't believe it!
Edgeworth:
Regardless, I don't want you involved in this. You in particular I cannot ask to do this.December 25Gourd Lake ParkEntranceMaya:
This is where it happened?Phoenix:
Yeah. Gourd Lake is in the middle of this park.Maya:
I can see some police walking around in there.Phoenix:
Questioning people, probably.Maya:
Hey! Isn't that Detective Gumshoe over there?Gumshoe:
Well, pal!? There's enough of us here! Anyone found anything?Police:
S-sorry, sir... Nothing.Gumshoe:
Idiot! The trial's tomorrow! We need clues, on the double!Police:
B-but, sir... There weren't any clues... that's why we arrested that attorney, Mr. Edgeworth! It's clear, sir. He's the one who--Gumshoe:
Shaddup! Just you try saying that again! I'll... I'll... I'll make you sorry if you do! (Changed from [I'll... er... I'll make you sorry if you do!] in the original release) So just... just, get outta my face, pal! (Changed from [I mean... just, get outta my face, pal!] in the original release)Police:
Y-yes, sir!Maya:
Detective Gumshoe's kinda scary today!Gumshoe:
Recruits... peh! ... Aah!Maya:
Eek!Gumshoe:
Hey, you're that Harry guy! Harry Butz!Phoenix:
Wright! Phoenix Wright! (Will he ever learn my name!?)Gumshoe:
And just what are you doing here, pal? Investigating!?Phoenix:
Huh? Um, well, yes. I suppose.Gumshoe:
Well, I'm here to help! Ask me anything you want! Bring it!Maya:
He seems different than usual. I wonder what's up? Umm... Mr. Edgeworth hasn't actually asked us to defend him yet...Gumshoe:
Huh!? Oh? Y-you don't say...Examine









Trees







Phoenix:
I feel winter's chill from the bare leaf trees today... *sigh* What is it about winter that turns people into poets?
Maya:
I don't know, but my toes are starting to feel numb.
Phoenix:
(Yes... my poetry has that effect on some people.)




Sign







Phoenix:
The sign says "Gourd Lake Nature Park." This place is full of families picnicking on the weekend.
Maya:
But... no waterfall.
Phoenix:
Not many picnickers come here for spiritual training, Maya.Talk









What happened







Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe? Do you know what happened here?
Gumshoe:
Huh? You don't know, pal?
Phoenix:
No...
Gumshoe:
Wow, okay, Mr. Head-in-the-fluffy-pink-clouds Lawyer.
Phoenix:
Head-in-the... huh?
Gumshoe:
Never mind, I'll tell you. It happened last night, about 15 minutes after midnight. There was a boat out on Gourd Lake. In that boat were two men. One of those men shot the other with a pistol.
Maya:
And... the shooter was Mr. Edgeworth?
Gumshoe:
A cop who arrived on the scene arrested him.
Maya:
How did they get there so fast? (Changed from [How did he get there so fast?] in the original release)
Gumshoe:
Well... There was a witness. When the report came in, we raced to the lake.
Phoenix:
A witness?




Edgeworth







Maya:
You don't think Mr. Edgeworth is a... murderer, do you!? (Changed from [You don't think Mr. Edgeworth is a... murderer!?] in the original release)
Gumshoe:
Absolutely not! It's impossible! I don't care if there's a witness either! I don't believe a lick of it!
Maya:
R-right! Who cares what the witness says!
Phoenix:
(I care!)
Maya:
... You really believe in him, don't you, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Course I do! But... the police are pretty sure he's the killer. Nobody's even really taking this investigation that seriously.
Maya:
Oh no!
Gumshoe:
After all the help Mr. Edgeworth has been to us... Hard to imagine that no one's standing up to take his side.
Maya:
Well, at least you are, Detective. At least you are.




Defense request







Maya:
Do you know who will be Mr. Edgeworth's defense attorney in tomorrow's trial?
Gumshoe:
He hasn't got one yet.
Maya:
What? The trial IS tomorrow, isn't it?
Gumshoe:
Well, I don't know the whole story... But apparently no one he's been talking to will take his case.
Maya:
W-why not?
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth won't tell me! When you guys showed up, I figured he'd asked you to defend him.
Phoenix:
U-unfortunately not...
Gumshoe:
Well, pal, then you got a job to do! Help out Mr. Edgeworth! Prove that badge you wear isn't just some fancy piece of metal! Prove it to me, pal! Show me you're an attorney!




Defense request (after presenting Attorney's Badge in Detention Center - Visitor's Room)







Maya:
I-is it true? No one will take Mr. Edgeworth's case?
Gumshoe:
Yeah... He's a bit of a celebrity. If you defended him, and lost, your reputation'd be sure to suffer. What's more... The case against him is... well, it's pretty solid.
Phoenix:
(I suppose it would be if they have a witness.)
Gumshoe:
Hey! Pal! Don't tell me your going to turn your back on him too!? Remember the Steel Samurai case? (Changed from [Remember the Steel Samurai!] in the original release) Mr. Edgeworth helped you get your client declared innocent!
Phoenix:
I... I know. I went to Edgeworth. I tried. He really doesn't want us to represent him. Especially not us, he said.
Gumshoe:
What!? W-well, that doesn't make any sense, pal! You should have heard him talking about you after that trial! (Changed from [You should have heard him talking about you after the Steel Samurai case!] in the original release) He kept saying "Wright, Wright, Wright," over and over.
Maya:
... Nick? I'm not sure that's a good sign.
Phoenix:
Neither am I...
Gumshoe:
Why wouldn't he want your help? I don't get it.




The witness (appears after "What happened")







Phoenix:
Who was this witness?
Gumshoe:
Er, sorry, pal. That's confidential. Anyway, the witness saw everything, apparently. I'm sure they'll turn up at the trial tomorrow.
Phoenix:
Was there only that one witness?
Gumshoe:
Yep. It was pretty cold out on the lake last night. And, it was Christmas Eve after all. Still, we're being thorough. You never know when you're going to turn up another witness. That's why we're here today, checking things out. So far, we're coming up empty...
Maya:
Oh! It's Christmas today! I'd forgotten. What are you getting me for Christmas, Nick?
Phoenix:
Talk to Santa.Present









Attorney's Badge







Gumshoe:
That badge! You're showing that to the wrong guy, pal! You gotta show that to someone who needs it!After clearing all Talk options:Police:
Detective Gumshoe, sir!Gumshoe:
What? Find something!?Police:
Um, no, sir. Not yet. But there was a call from the precinct. They want to hold an investigation briefing...Gumshoe:
A briefing? Right! I'm off! Oh... Sorry, pal. I guess you heard. I gotta go. Any last things you want to ask me about before I head back?The autopsy report







Maya:
Well, yes. Do you have any information on the victim...?
Gumshoe:
Sorry... They haven't worked up the autopsy report yet. I'm still waiting for it myself. Actually... Say, if you get the time, drop by the precinct! We can talk more there, pal!
Leads to:
"You're not coming back, Detective?"How to get in touch with you







Leads to:
"You're not coming back, Detective?"Phoenix:
You're not coming back, Detective?Gumshoe:
Erm... Probably not, pal.Phoenix:
So, what should we do if we have something to talk to you about...?Gumshoe:
Ah, right. Here, I'll show you how to get to the precinct. Come down and see me anytime.Detective Gumshoe gave you directions to the police station.Phoenix:
Oh, hey! Detective Gumshoe!Gumshoe:
W-what!?Phoenix:
Um, we'd like to take a look around in the park. Can we walk around?Gumshoe:
Yeah! No problem, pal. You got my permission.Maya:
You know, Nick. I think there's something to be said for talking to people when they're busy.Phoenix:
Yeah. They don't have time to think about not giving you information...Maya:
Right! Now, let's get investigating!December 25Police DepartmentCriminal AffairsMaya:
... Looks like Detective Gumshoe isn't here.Chief:
Something wrong, miss? Hmm? Turning yourself in? Okay, what did you do? Shoplifting? Larceny? Public indecency...?Maya:
N-no! None of those things! We're looking for Detective Gumshoe... is he around?Chief:
Gumshoe? Oh yeah. He's in a meeting right now. I don't think he'll be out any time soon.Maya:
Okay, we'll come back.Chief:
You do that. Oh, and go straight home and stay out of trouble. No more shoplifting, you got that?Maya:
... Do I look like a criminal or something?Examine









Poster







Phoenix:
A poster of a female police officer... Wait, no. That's the latest "Babes in Uniform" calendar. My bad.




Detective







Phoenix:
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
Police:
"...your mama could see you know she'd be crying'... ...a break and spit it out, you lowlife scumbag..."
Phoenix:
... He must be doing image training for interrogations.




Desk







Phoenix:
These are the detectives' desks. There are computers and files on each one. Funny, they're a lot tidier than I'd expect. I guess the detectives don't spend a lot of time at their desks.




Blue Badger







Phoenix:
Hey, is that the police department's mascot...?
Chief:
That's the "Blue Badger"! It was my idea! I made it! It's my mascot!
Phoenix:
I... see. How nice.
Chief:
I'll get him assigned mascot of the Criminal Affairs Dept. if it's the last thing I do!
Phoenix:
Um, good luck!




Chief







Phoenix:
This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen.
Chief:
Wha...!? "Gourd Lake...!" "Gourdy sighted"!!! I don't believe it!
Phoenix:
(Shouldn't you be reading something more important...?)December 25Gourd LakePublic BeachMaya:
Wowsers! This is "Gourd Lake"?Phoenix:
Yup. I'm not sure it warrants a "wowsers," though.Maya:
Hmm. Probably not. But hey, look at that snack stand!Phoenix:
"Samurai Dogs"...?Maya:

With a name like Samurai Dog, how could they not be?Maya:
They're a little behind the times, though. The kids are all into "The Pink Princess" now. I mean, like, y'know!?Phoenix:
(Nope.)Examine









Lake







Maya:
Wow. Gourd Lake is really big.
Phoenix:
Yeah.
Maya:
Say, Nick. Why is it called "Gourd Lake"?
Phoenix:
Oh. Well, a long time ago, they used to grow gourds here.
Maya:
Whoa! No way! I was sure it was because the lake looked like a gourd when viewed from above! You know, like an hourglass shape?
Phoenix:
Well, it is shaped like a gourd, actually. But that's just a coincidence.
Maya:
Oh. Okay.




Trash can







Phoenix:
The trashcan is empty. At least the place is well maintained.




Bench







Phoenix:
A lineup of plastic benches. I guess the idea is you buy a dog and eat it here. I doubt anyone would sit here and eat on a day like this. Except maybe Maya... if she had a Samurai Dog.




Sign







Phoenix:
Huh... I almost didn't see that signpost. "Left - Boat docks" "Right - Exit"




Vendor stand







Phoenix:
A hotdog stand. It's closed... The Christmas fringe looks a little half-baked. The banner reads "Samurai Dogs"... Somebody needs to redecorate.




Popper







Maya:
Huh. Someone left some poppers here. You know, you pull the string... (Changed from [Huh. Someone left one of those poppers here. You know, you pull the string...] in the original release)
Phoenix:
...And it goes "pop." Yeah, I know the ones. You see them a lot around New Year's.

Anything else







Edgeworth:
What's that? I'm not in the mood for idle banter, Wright.December 25Boat Rental ShopMaya:
Nick... what is this place?Phoenix:
A boat rental shop. Closed for Christmas it seems. I guess a murder taking place on one of the boats won't be good for business, either.Maya:
Boats... I've never ridden on a boat.Phoenix:
Really? Well, how about we go out on one when the trial is finished?Maya:
Hey, good idea! You bet!Examine









Trees







Phoenix:
There's more forest off that way. I doubt I'd find any helpful clues in there.




Shop







Phoenix:
A small boat rental shop. Doesn't look like anyone is around. They're probably closed because it's Christmas.




Boats







Phoenix:
There are some boats floating at the dock. Was one of these boats used in the murder, I wonder?
Maya:
Nick?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Maya:
I changed my mind. I don't really want to go for a boat ride.December 25Gourd Lake WoodsMaya:

(That's true...) Good call, Maya. Let's go talk to them.Examine









Camera







Maya:
Hey, Nick. Check out this camera!
Phoenix:
Yeah... what's with the big mic and that box on top, I wonder? It looks like some sort of automatic system for taking a photo when a noise is heard.
Maya:
Wow! Hey, let's see if it works! *cough* "Hi, I'm Nick!" ... Maybe I'm not saying it loud enough. "YO! I'M NICK!!!" ... Huh. NIIIIIIIIII......IIIIIIIIIICK!
Phoenix:

Phoenix:
D-don't kick it! (It must not be set up to respond to voices.)

Leads to:
"This camera has a mic and some sort of attachment."




Trees







Phoenix:
The trees grow quite thick here. Further back, the trees fade into the shadow where the sunlight can't reach them.




Sign







Phoenix:
The sign says "No Camping." Funny place to pick to pitch your tent.
Maya:
Wait, what if the sign said "No Setting Tents on Fire"?
Phoenix:
... I don't think they have signs like that.
Maya:
Oh...




Sheet







Phoenix:
There's food and some magazines on the sheet. It takes a pretty tough skin to camp in this cold.




Campfire







Maya:
Hey, Nick!
Phoenix:
What, don't tell me you're hungry again?
Maya:
No, no. I was just wondering, why are camping pots and pans made of aluminum?
Phoenix:
... They didn't talk about that in any of the law books.
Maya:
So, there's no law saying they have to be made out of aluminum, then!
Phoenix:
(I'm not having this conversation...)




SUV







Phoenix:
This SUV has seen better days. It's dented all over. I can't believe anyone would drive their car down here.Phoenix:

What happened







Lotta:
Oh yeah, when was that murder, anyway? I ain't seen much television lately.
Phoenix:
It happened late in the night on Christmas Eve.
Lotta:
That so? Christmas Eve?
Phoenix:
A man on a boat was shot... Did you see anything?
Lotta:
Well, lemme see. A boat, ya say? I reckon I mighta seen one... not sure though. Y'all gotta remember I've been watching this here lake for a good three days now. I seen enough boats to choke a mule. Kinda hard to remember which I seen when.

So, how did the meeting go?
Gumshoe:
I can't tell you, pal! You're a lawyer!
Phoenix:
T-true...
Gumshoe:
... Y'know... I don't know what to believe anymore. Sure, Mr. Edgeworth's human like you or me. Still... I get the feeling that if he'd done something wrong, he wouldn't go hiding it. That's just the kind of guy he is. Why can't anyone else see that?
Maya:
So, they think that Mr. Edgeworth did it...?
Gumshoe:
Well, the trial's starting tomorrow, as scheduled.
Maya:
I see...
Gumshoe:

Umm... hey, in the end you did tell us about the meeting!

And... do me a favor! Stand by Mr. Edgeworth! He needs help, and you're the ones to help him! I'm sure he's got some reason why he won't talk to us.
Maya:
Thanks, Detective Gumshoe.




Trusting Edgeworth (appears after "The meeting")







Maya:
Detective Gumshoe... How come you trust Mr. Edgeworth so much?
Gumshoe:
Well, I'd think that was obvious. We got a strong working relationship, us two. We trust each other, and that's how it works.
Maya:
A "working relationship"?
Gumshoe:
See, Mr. Edgeworth always gets his defendants declared "guilty" every time. Yeah, his methods might be a little extreme at times. But... there's a reason! He trusts our investigation, see? He trusts us to get the right man! That's why I work extra hard, pal. We've got to earn that trust he places in us.
Maya:
I see...
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth is a man you can trust... And you have my word on that!

What to do







Phoenix:
Well, what should we do?

Huh? You mean you don't know? It's here, in this very lake! A giant, mysterious monster! Gourdy!
Maya:
A... monster?
Butz:
Yeah. Check it out. This is an article from yesterday's newspaper. There's a photo!
Maya:
Wow! It's r-really real! Nick! A monster! A real monster!
Phoenix:
Umm... yeah. (It's probably just a log or something... right?) Hey... there's a quote here from the person who took the photo. Hmm? What's this? "I set the camera to automatic, and when we got into the frame... I heard a loud 'bang'! Like an explosion... followed by the sound of something slipping into the water..."
Maya:
I wish I could have seen it!
Phoenix:
(Why would there be a sound like an explosion...?) Larry. Could I borrow this article from you?
Butz:
Sure, no problem. That'll be one million dollars!
Maya:
O-one million...?

A murder?

Well, Miles Edgeworth shot someone with a pistol.

Robert Hammond (appears after presenting Autopsy Report)







Phoenix:
Who is this Hammond guy, anyway?
Grossberg:
Mr. Hammond... He was the defense attorney in that case...
Phoenix:
"That case"...?
Grossberg:
Yes, the "DL-6 Incident."
Phoenix:
"DL-6"...? (Why does that sound so familiar?)
Grossberg:
Perhaps you remember?
Phoenix:
(I'm sure someone mentioned it during the trial for Mia's murder.)
Grossberg:
That was the incident where the police were so at a loss they used a spirit medium.
Maya:
...! Wait... you don't mean? Was that medium my mother?
Grossberg:
Yes, my dear. The spirit medium, Misty Fey, your mother, contacted the spirit of the victim. But... the case was a loss. No conviction was made.




The DL-6 Incident (appears after "Robert Hammond")







Grossberg:
The DL-6 Incident, yes... Happened 15 years ago. A very strange case, indeed.
Phoenix:
They never caught the criminal, right?
Grossberg:
Correct. Misty Fey used her powers to talk to the spirit of the late victim. Her testimony led to charges being laid against one man. But Mr. Hammond won the case and the suspect was declared innocent.
Maya:
... And the police blamed my mother, calling her a fraud. You were the one who helped her out then, right, Mr. Grossberg?
Grossberg:
Er... y-yes. Yes, quite.
Maya:
Thank you!

So, this camera on the lake takes a photo whenever it hears an explosion sound?
Maya:
That's what she said.
Grossberg:
And it just happened to be set up on the beach, pointing out on the lake?

The DL-6 Incident (appears after presenting Misty Fey's Photo)







Edgeworth:
The "DL-6 Incident"... was when my father died. Right before my eyes... He was shot and killed, and I saw it all.
Maya:
...!
Edgeworth:
My memories from that time are... foggy. I suppose it's a self-defense mechanism. In any case, a suspect was arrested... a man. It's pretty clear he was the only one who could have killed my father. The spirit medium they used to talk to my late father said the same thing. It was an attorney by the name of Robert Hammond that cleared the suspect's name.
Phoenix:
And Hammond... is the victim in the Gourd Lake murder?
Edgeworth:
Correct.
Maya:
Umm... That spirit medium... that was my mom.
Edgeworth:
What? You mean you're...? ... It's strange. I thought that terrible incident was about to end, and now... this.
Phoenix:
"About to end"?
Edgeworth:
The DL-6 Incident happened 15 years ago. 15 years ago... on December 28.
Maya:
December 28?
Edgeworth:
The statute of limitations on the case runs out in three days.
Phoenix:
What!?
Maya:
Um, Nick? What does that mean?
Phoenix:
When a case's statute of limitations runs out, legally, the case never happened.
Edgeworth:
Three days from now, DL-6 will be closed... forever.




The suspect (appears after "The DL-6 Incident")







Maya:
What happened to the suspect? The one who got off innocent?
Edgeworth:
I don't know... He disappeared from public view. Nobody knows where to. If he's still alive, he'd be about 50 years old now.
Phoenix:
(I guess I can understand why he'd go into hiding... It'd be hard to live a normal life after being a murder suspect in such a big case.)




Your father (appears after "The DL-6 Incident")







Maya:
Umm... so, was your father a lawyer?

Phoenix:
About the "DL-6 Incident"...
Edgeworth:
Right... DL-6. I didn't want you to find out about it. That is why I refused your offer to defend me. I'm sorry if it sounded like I thought you weren't up to the job. I just wanted to keep you away from DL-6.
Phoenix:
So... do you still think it would have been better for me to stay away?

Phoenix:
Right. I saw it too... But you really can't tell from the photo who it is shooting.

She can do that!?

I'm afraid tomorrow is going to be life or death for poor Mr. Edgeworth. We got a witness who says she saw the very moment of the murder. And we got a photo taken when the shot rang out.

Karma...? (ellipsis and question mark highlighted in the original release)Edgeworth:
That's right, Manfred von Karma. He's the best prosecutor there is. He hasn't lost a case in his 40-year career. He is a god of prosecution, Wright! A god!Maya:
Not a single case?Edgeworth:
He'll do anything to get a guilty verdict, anything.Phoenix:
Hmm. Sounds like someone else I know, Edgeworth.Edgeworth:
Hmph. You don't understand. I mean he'll really do anything. Manfred von Karma is a man to be feared.Phoenix:
(That's quite a claim coming from someone who forges evidence...)Edgeworth:
He taught me what it really means to "prosecute."Phoenix:
Wh-what!?Edgeworth:
Just picture a prosecutor as vicious as me... multiplied by a factor of ten.Maya:
Ugh... So... so was he your teacher, then, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:
Something like that...Maya:
And now he's trying to get you found guilty!? What a creep! Oh, wait... Maybe he's planning on losing on purpose to help you out.Edgeworth:
Not a chance... He hasn't lost once in 40 years. 40 years! He's as ruthless as me, times twenty!Maya:
That's pretty ruthless...Edgeworth:

Describe the incident. Now!Gumshoe:
Y-yessir!Phoenix:
(Detective Gumshoe looks nervous...)Gumshoe:
Er, please take a look at the map. The murder happened late Christmas Eve, around midnight. There was one boat in the very middle of the lake. There were two men on the boat. Now, there happened to be a woman camping here on the edge of the lake. At 12:10 AM, she heard two pistol shots. Then the boat started to move. It went towards the boat rental shop.Karma:
Hmm.Overhead Map added to the Court Record.Karma:
Testify to the court about your arrest. Now!Judge:
W-w-wait! Mr. von Karma...Karma:

Wrong. There is only one thing you need to do here. You will slam down your gavel and say the word "guilty." That is your role!Judge:
Y-yes, of course. You're quite right.Phoenix:

Was the bullet found in the body fired from this pistol?Gumshoe:
Yes. The ballistic markings on the bullet match the pistol.Judge:
Hmm...Maya:
Hey, Nick! What does he mean, "ballistic markings"?Karma:
Shocking! To imagine someone here does not know something as basic as ballistic markings!Maya:
N-Nick! He's glaring at me!Karma:
Tsk... very well, I'll explain. Actually, Judge! You do it.Judge:
Eh? M-me? ... Erm, ahem. Ballistic markings are like the "fingerprints" of a gun. The barrel leaves distinctive marks on each bullet it fires. You can examine these "ballistic fingerprints" to see which gun fired the shot. It's quite accurate.Karma:
Indeed. This leads to one, inevitable conclusion: the bullet found in the victim's heart... was, without a doubt, fired from this pistol. This pistol which, as you may recall, was covered with the defendant's own fingerprints!Judge:
O-order! Order!Phoenix:

Well, Judge?Judge:
I'd say it's almost decisive, yes. Honestly, I could declare a verdict at this point. However...Karma:

Y-you mean it was a suicide!?Edgeworth:

Er... very well. Your testimony, please.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Lotta:
It was Christmas Eve, just after midnight, I reckon.
I was in my car.
I heard this "bang" come up from the lake.
When I looked out the window, I saw two gents in a boat.
Then there was another "bang"...
There wasn't nary a thing on the lake but that boat.Karma:
Enough.Lotta:
Huh?Karma:
Judge! She happened to take a photo of the incident! This is that photo. Accept it as evidence.Judge:
W-well! This is a surprise! This looks like... the very moment of the murder! O-Order! I will remove you from the court if I do not have order immediately!Karma:
As the witness testified, she looked at the lake when she heard the shot. There were no other boats on that lake! So, the man in the boat with the victim must have been the one who shot him... Yes. It was the defendant, Miles Edgeworth!!!Judge:
Order! Order! Order...! I will have order!Karma:
... Well, Judge?Judge:
The evidence is... decisive. I have very little doubt about this case. Very well, this court finds the defendant...Phoenix:Phoenix:
W-wait! Your Honor! I haven't cross-examined the witness yet!Karma:
A cross-examination? We have photographic proof! What question can there possibly be!? This photo is worth a thousand words... and they all read "guilty"! You lose. Or... Do you claim to have found a contradiction in her testimony!?Phoenix:
...!Karma:
Very well. If you have to, you may cross-examine the witness. You will only flounder and ask meaningless questions! You will fail to find anything! And then, I will have you held in contempt of court!Maya:
Uh, Nick... contempt...?Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Honestly, I found nothing.
Maya:
I dunno, I thought her testimony was strange. She was so vague about everything!
Phoenix:
I bet von Karma probably fed her her lines.
Maya:
But... But if you don't cross-examine her, the judge will...
Phoenix:
He'll bang down that "flimsy gavel" of his and declare Edgeworth guilty.
Maya:
I guess we'll just have to bluff it.

I was looking right at that boat, the whole time, cross my heart and hope to fry.Judge:
Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.Karma:Karma:
The witness's testimony is unchanged from before! Whether she is a research student or a photographer has no bearing on this case! There is no need to waste more of our time with another pointless cross-examination!Judge:
Er... hmm.Phoenix:Phoenix:
I claim the defense's right to cross-examine the witness, Your Honor! (von Karma's up to something, I know it! He doesn't want me to cross-examine her because... why? Was there a contradiction?)Judge:
Very well. You may begin the cross-examination. You seem sure of yourself, you must have something in mind.Karma:
Hah! That would be a first!Phoenix:
(Hah hah, very funny.)Judge:
You understand that this is your last chance at a cross-examination, Mr. Wright? If there is no problem with the testimony this time, we will let the witness leave. I will announce my verdict at that time, Mr. Wright. Understood?Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.Cross Examination-- Lotta's New Testimony --Lotta:

Phoenix:
Then what manner of person are you!?
Lotta:
I'm not sure I'm high-falutin' enough to be called a "manner" of anything.Lotta:
I'm an investigative photographer.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
An "investigative photographer"?
Lotta:
Yep. You get your photo, and sell it to the press. It's that kind of business. Hey, I was taking pictures at my sister's graduation last year... N' guess what!
Phoenix:
Umm... what?
Lotta:
There was a yoofoh just a' hanging in the sky!
Phoenix:
A "yoofoh"...?
Lotta:
You know, an "Unidentified Flying Object"? A yoofoh! That's when I had sort of a revelation. I knew I should become an investigative photographer!
Phoenix:
I... I see. (Kind of a shaky basis for a career...)Lotta:
Imagine what a scoop it'd be if I got a picture of that monster!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Is "Gourdy" really all that newsworthy?
Lotta:
Heck yeah! They even had him up on the TV!
Phoenix:
(I'm not sure that appearing on the local news "rumor of the month" show qualifies. Last month's show was "Bigfoot Sighted on Acorn Hill," I believe.)
Lotta:
Hey! They also had a picture of him in the newspaper! For real!
Judge:
Mr. Wright. This is one fight I do not believe you can win. Let's keep moving, shall we?
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.Lotta:
That's why I was camping out by the lake.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
That's why you put the automatic senior on your camera?
Lotta:
Yep. Borrowed it from a friend at a university. It analyzes every sound it picks up, and when it gets a "bang!"...
Phoenix:
It snaps a shot.
Lotta:
Yep.
Phoenix:
So, how many pictures has it taken so far?
Lotta:
The only time the camera triggered was that night.
Phoenix:
(Hmm...)Lotta:
But, that's all I was hiding.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
I think it's time you told us why you felt you had to hide your true purpose at the lake.
Lotta:
Heck, if word got out what I was up to, the lake'd be swarmin' with competitors!
Phoenix:
Competitors...?
Lotta:
Yeah! Second-rate shutterbugs trying to steal my scoop!
Phoenix:
Ah... Is that the only reason you were hiding the truth?
Lotta:
W-well, actually...

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Exactly what sort of sound was it?

Well, I never heard one before so I can't say for sure... but it sounded like a gunshot. It was a lot sharper a sound than I would have expected.

What? What did I do now? What're you giving me that look for?

Huh? Wait, so you're thinking maybe he was shot from some other place? I don't think so, nope. The lake was smooth as glass, and nobody was on the shore, neither.
Phoenix:

Phoenix:

"Ms. Hart!"Phoenix:
(I'd better find some sort of contradiction in this testimony... I won't be able to beat von Karma any other way... There has to be something!)Phoenix:
Ms. Hart! Were you REALLY looking at that boat!?Lotta:
W-what's with you!? Course I was looking at it! It was the only thing out there! Any normal person'd be looking at it!Phoenix:
I agree, any normal person would. But you are far from normal!Lotta:
Wh-what!? Y'all wanna step over here and say that!?Phoenix:
You were camping at the lake to take a picture of Gourdy! Think about it-- What would you do if you heard a loud noise? You'd be scanning the lake for any sign of Gourdy, that's what! You wouldn't give the boat a second thought!Lotta:
Aah!Judge:
Order! Continue, Mr. Wright!Phoenix:
You testified that you were watching the boat through binoculars! However, you wouldn't need binoculars to watch that boat! You needed them to search for Gourdy... and that's what you were doing!Lotta:
...! ... ...Phoenix:
Well!?Lotta:
Hmph... Well, now that y'all mention it... I did sort of take my binoculars and kind of scan the lake a bit... I mean, Gourdy might be out there, n' all...Judge:
M-Ms. Hart! A-are you saying that you were NOT watching the boat, then?Lotta:
... S-sorry, y'all. I wasn't fibbing, really. I was, just... I thought y'know, I could be witness to a murder n' all! I kinda got excited. I was sure I was watching that boat... till now.Judge:
... This... this is totally uncalled for--Lotta:
B-but hey! You got the photograph! You got proof!Judge:
Hmm... Still, we can't see who is shooting who in this.Lotta:

(What was she going to say? She took the photo... and what? Wait a second...)Gumshoe:
She even had a photograph to prove it.Phoenix:
But you really can't tell from the photo who is shooting.Gumshoe:
That's why she said she's going to enlarge the photo. She said "it'll drop the quality a mite, but should let us see who's who!"Phoenix:
(She enlarged that photo! Why won't von Karma let her show it? I've got a hunch! I bet that enlarged photo shows something bad for von Karma! This is my chance! If I'm wrong, though, it'll mean prison for Edgeworth... or worse. What should I do!?)Make her show the enlargement







Leads to:
"Ms. Hart! Look at this photograph."Wait and see what happens







Phoenix:
(If this is a trap... I'd better hold back and see how things go. But... if I wait now, the cross-examination will be over! Can I really risk that!?)



Do nothing







Judge:
This hereby ends the cross-examination of Ms. Lotta Hart.
Karma:
And none too soon. That was a flagrant waste of my time.
Judge:
Mr. von Karma, do you have anything to add?
Karma:
I stated everything I needed to when this trial began. Decisive evidence. A decisive witness. What else could possibly be required?
Judge:
Nothing, of course.
Phoenix:
(Oh no! I should have pressed further!)
Judge:
This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court find the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth...

Guilty

Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!

Y-yeah! I did!Phoenix:
Why has that enlargement not been presented to the court!?Karma:Karma:
B-because it does not exist!Lotta:
What're y'all talking about!? You were the one who told me not to show it in court in the first place! You old fool!Judge:

Y-yes, Your Honor! Right away!
Leads back to:
"I'll show you the evidence that left hand contradicts!"Phoenix:
The evidence is clear. The man in this photograph is holding that pistol in his left hand. However! The prints on the murder weapon were from Edgeworth's "right hand"! Ergo! The man shooting the pistol in this photograph... Is not Mr. Edgeworth!!!Judge:
Now that everyone in the courtroom has quieted down... I would like to reconvene this court of law! Mr. Wright.Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.Judge:
You have given us definitive proof today. We now know that it was not Mr. Edgeworth who fired the pistol that night. However... This leaves us with a rather large problem. If Mr. Edgeworth didn't do it, then who shot our victim?Karma:
Precisely! As we have seen, there were no other people on the lake that night! Who but the defendant could have shot the victim!?Ms. Hart







Phoenix:
Who else but the witness, Ms. Lotta Hart!
Judge:
Wh-what!? Do you have proof of this!?
Phoenix:
(Proof-shmoof! Always with the proof! Oh... wait, I do need proof, don't I.)
Judge:
Mr. Wright! I'll have you remember this is a court of law!

Well, Wright! Your answer!

"Who but the defendant could have shot the victim!?"Phoenix:
There is only one explanation remaining! The man who shot the victim was none other than... the victim himself!!!Judge:
Order! Order! So... you are saying that the victim committed suicide?Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. I can think of no other explanation.Judge:
Hmm... Indeed, that does seem to be the only remaining option.Karma:Karma:
I'm so very, very sorry, Mr. Wright. But suicide is out of the question.Phoenix:
Wh-what!?Karma:
An examination of the victim's wound reveals the distance at which he was shot.Phoenix:
The... distance?Karma:
The victim was clearly shot from further than a meter away!Phoenix:
A meter! Th-that's three feet!Karma:
There is no way it could have been suicide!Judge:
Order! Order! Mr. von Karma! Are you sure of the accuracy of your data!?Karma:
Of course! I had already considered the possibility of suicide, you see.Autopsy Report updated in the Court Record.Judge:
Hmm... I see. Very well, allow me to state my opinion. Considering the situation, the shooter had to be the defendant, Mr. Edgeworth. However! The prints on the gun reveal that the shooter was not Mr. Edgeworth. This is a conundrum. Therefore, I would like to suspend proceedings for this trial for the day.

No. I have yet to be declared innocent, Wright.Phoenix:
Well, yeah, but... What happened out there on that lake, anyway!? If he didn't commit suicide, then who...? The shooter was about a meter away, too!Edgeworth:
... W-what? Don't give me that look! I did not kill him!Phoenix:
I was just kidding around.Edgeworth:
Hmph.Phoenix:
Look... I'm going to go check on Maya.Edgeworth:
Oh... Wright.Phoenix:
What?Edgeworth:
Tell her something for me.Phoenix:
What?Edgeworth:

Well, you did save the trial... Just, behave from now on, okay?Maya:
O... Okay.Talk









Questioning







Phoenix:
Have you been questioned yet?
Maya:
No... not yet. Detective Gumshoe was here just now. He said "seeing as this is your first offense, we'll let you go after questioning."
Phoenix:
Whew...
Maya:
Oh, and he wanted me to get bail money ready. You can pay for me, okay?
Phoenix:
Huh? How much?
Maya:
I don't know. I guess they'll send you a bill or something.
Phoenix:
(Why do I picture giant bales of money every time I hear the word "bail"?)




Mia







Phoenix:
Any luck with Mia...?
Maya:
None... I can't get through to her at all. I tried... I really did! I don't know what to do... ... I think I probably shouldn't have stopped my training.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... she sounds like she really did do her best. I should check and see if there are any waterfalls in the local area...)
Maya:
I wonder if I'll ever see my sister again...Present









Attorney's Badge







Maya:
It must be nice, Nick. You can just show that to anyone and say "I'm a lawyer!" But, spirit mediums, well...
Phoenix:
I dunno, with your clothes, I bet at least some people would recognize you...
Maya:
But these are medium-in-training clothes... I wonder if I'll ever be a proper medium...




Lake Photo







Maya:
Isn't that the enlarged photo Lotta was talking about?
Phoenix:
Uh huh.
Maya:
Huh... It's nice and big... but you can't really see the faces any clearer, can you?




Misty Fey's Photo







Maya:
My... mother. ...
Phoenix:
(Now that I've shown her the picture, I'm not so sure it was the right thing to do. No... I'm pretty sure it was the wrong thing to do.)




Gourdy Article







Maya:
I want to see Gourdy, too!
Phoenix:
If he really exists.
Maya:
Well, I'd say a photograph is pretty good proof! Once this trial is over, let's get some fishing poles and go down to the lake!
Phoenix:
(Even if there is a monster in that lake, fishing poles sound like a BAD idea...)




Pistol Bullet







Maya:
So the markings on this bullet and the barrel of the pistol matched?
Phoenix:
Hey, I'm surprised you remembered that!
Maya:
How could I forget after von Karma rubbed it in so much? So, which one of these are the ballistic markings?
Phoenix:
I'm... not really sure.




Pistol







Maya:
Mr. Edgeworth's prints are on this pistol, aren't they?
Phoenix:
Yes... the prints from his right hand. But they must have gotten on there at some other time other than the shooting.
Maya:
What? Really!?
Phoenix:
(The shooter used his left hand, after all...)

Detective







Phoenix:
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
Police:
"Don't do anything rash! Why jump...? ...You have every reason to live!"
Phoenix:
... He must be doing image training for talking down a potential suicide.




Chief







Phoenix:
This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen.
Chief:
Wha...!? Rook to Bishop 7... Checkmate!? I don't believe it!

Bookshelf







Phoenix:
Expensive-looking mahogany bookshelves, filled with expensive-looking books. Hmm... funny... they don't look like they've ever been read.




Desk







Phoenix:
A solid mahogany desk. The wood's been polished to a deep luster.




Vacant wall







Phoenix:
I guess Mr. Grossberg isn't getting that painting back. I feel kind of bad for him...




Potted plant







Phoenix:
An expensive potted plant. No idea what kind of plant it is, but it's probably the most expensive one available.




Table







Phoenix:
A table for clients. Hmm... an elegant ebony case, and if I'm not mistaken, that lighter's made of solid gold. Even I can tell someone here's got money to burn.December 26Gourd Lake ParkEntrancePhoenix:
There are fewer than there were yesterday, but the cops are still around in the park. I wonder if Detective Gumshoe is here today?Examine









Trees







Phoenix:
I feel winter's chill from the bare leaf trees today... There's a lot of trees here. I guess that's why they call it a "nature park." It's quite pretty when the cherry trees along the lakeside blossom in spring. Today... it's just cold.




Sign







Phoenix:
The sign says "Gourd Lake Nature Park." This place is full of families picnicking on the weekend. It's a little cold for picnicking these days, though.December 26Gourd LakePublic BeachPhoenix:
Haven't seen Larry around at all. Probably off paying through the nose on a date with the lovely Kiyance...Examine









Lake







Phoenix:
The famous Gourd Lake... Its green waters stretch out on both sides... It's a pretty big lake, really.December 26Boat Rental ShopPhoenix:
(Looks like the boat rental shop is closed today, too.)Examine









Shop







Phoenix:
A small boat rental shop. Doesn't look like anyone is around. They're probably closed because of the murder.




Boats







Phoenix:
There are some boats floating at the dock. The murder took place in a boat from this dock... Apparently, the police took away the actual boat that was used that night. Indeed, there's space for one more boat at the dock.December 26Gourd Lake WoodsPhoenix:
Hey, Detective Gumshoe!Gumshoe:
Hey, pal! The trial today, it, er... ...Phoenix:
Yes? What about the trial?Gumshoe:
Well, I was going to say "good show," but it wasn't really all that... Though you did save Mr. Edgeworth, I guess... (Changed from [Though you did save Edgeworth, I guess...] in the original release) I just wasn't sure how to thank you... you know?Phoenix:
Er... thanks.Examine









Camera







Phoenix:
Lotta's camera is staring out at the lake, as usual. Even a novice like me can tell that camera must cost a pretty penny. I hope she doesn't leave it out here to get stolen.




Sign







Phoenix:
The sign says "No Camping." Funny place to pick to pitch your tent.




Campfire







Phoenix:
I wonder why she brought a camping cooker with her? There's a convenience store right up the street... I guess she wanted to get into the outdoor spirit.




SUV







Phoenix:
I don't think Lotta takes very good care of her SUV. It's covered with dents. I can't believe anyone would drive their car down here.Talk









Tomorrow's trial







Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe? Any idea what strategy von Karma is planning for tomorrow?
Gumshoe:
It sounds like he's bringing in another witness!
Phoenix:
Another witness!? Oh, right, he said something about that in the trial today...


Karma:
There were two witnesses!


Phoenix:
I was wondering who that other witness was! Er... who was it?
Gumshoe:
S... sorry, pal. As much as I'd like to, I'm not at liberty to divulge that information.
Phoenix:
(Right...)




Prosecutor Edgeworth







Phoenix:
Oh, right... I wanted to ask you something about Edgeworth.
Gumshoe:
What's up?
Phoenix:
Is he afraid of earthquakes? I never heard anything about that before.
Gumshoe:
... Mr. Edgeworth doesn't talk about himself too much, see. But there's one thing that's clear as day... Him hating crime the way he does... And him becoming a lawyer... And him being scared of earthquakes... It all started with that incident.
Phoenix:
The DL-6 Incident?
Gumshoe:
Yep, that's the one. Fifteen years ago... when he saw his father shot before his very eyes! He still feels the pain now, you can see it in his eyes.




Maya Fey







Phoenix:
I wanted to talk to you about Maya Fey...
Gumshoe:
Huh? She's not out on bail yet? That's strange. I told 'em to let her go as soon as they had their report written up. Man... I don't know what would have happened in that courtroom today if it weren't for her. Seeing her getting dragged out by the bailiff... I'll be honest with you, pal. I shed a tear or two. Mr. Edgeworth, he was so moved I saw his lip trembling. (Changed from [Edgeworth, he was so moved I saw his lip trembling.] in the original release)
Phoenix:
Really!? (Cold-as-ice Edgeworth!?)
Gumshoe:
He was really grateful for what she did, you know.Present









Attorney's Badge







Gumshoe:
I think it's a little early for you to be proudly waving that thing around. You can be proud of yourself when you get Mr. Edgeworth declared innocent, pal!




Lotta's Camera







Gumshoe:
That woman really took us for a ride, didn't she? Claiming she was a witness to a murder and all...
Phoenix:
Still, if it weren't for her photograph, Mr. Edgeworth wouldn't have made it today.
Gumshoe:

Robert's Autopsy Report







Gumshoe:
Robert Hammond... He was the defense attorney in the DL-6 Incident trial. He's the one who got the sole suspect off the hook. I wonder what Mr. Edgeworth thinks of him. Not much, I'd wager.




Lake Photo







Gumshoe:
I don't care who you are, no one can tell me that that's Mr. Edgeworth! I mean, come on, it doesn't look like him at all!
Phoenix:
But Edgeworth has admitted he was on the boat.
Gumshoe:
Then he's the one being shot, then!
Phoenix:
He seemed fine in court today...
Gumshoe:
... Details, pal, details! Whose side are you on, anyway?
Phoenix:
(All I'm saying is we have to respect the evidence...)




Pistol Bullet







Gumshoe:
Yep, it was fired from the murder weapon, without a doubt.
Phoenix:
From a meter away... so it would have to have been from someone else on the boat.
Gumshoe:
Hmm...
Phoenix:
What do you make of this, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
Hey, making something of things is your job!
Phoenix:
Er... right. (Since when do lawyers have to do detectives' work for them!?)




Pistol







Gumshoe:
Maybe you should tell me why Mr. Edgeworth's prints were on the weapon, pal.
Phoenix:
Huh? How should I know!?




Lotta's Deposition







Gumshoe:
Now, she heard two gunshots, right?
Phoenix:
But wait... Look at the Court Record! According to this, the murder weapon was fired three times!
Gumshoe:
What!? How's that possible!?
Phoenix:
Where was the third shot fired?
Gumshoe:
I wonder... Maybe it was a practice shot or something?




Anything else

Thank you. Oh, wait! Umm... I was wondering, how much is bail going to be?Gumshoe:
Don't worry about that. Mr. Edgeworth is posting the whole amount.Phoenix:
What? Edgeworth...?Gumshoe:
Didn't I tell you? He's grateful to her for what she did. Alright, pal. Well don't forget to go pick her up, okay?Phoenix:

Well, they let you out in the end, didn't they?Maya:
Mmm... Oh, that reminds me... Thanks for bail.Phoenix:

Mr. Edgeworth did that...? ... I have to make it up to him! We've got to win this case, Nick!Talk









What to do







Phoenix:
What do you think we should do next?
Maya:
We're kind of lacking in the clues department. We could go to the park and look for Gourdy.
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
I-I was kidding!
Phoenix:
Still, if there are any clues out there, the park's as good a bet as any. What do you say? Shall we head down there?
Maya:
Sure!

Phoenix:
Have you noticed anything lately?
Maya:
Hmm... You know, I did notice one thing while I was here in detention. It's really pretty comfortable here. It's warm, and they keep it very clean.

Today's trial







Phoenix:
What did you think of the trial?
Lotta:
To be honest, I was doin' it half just to say I'd been a witness... Even though I didn't really see anything. I kinda convinced myself I had though... I'm sorry, I know I caused y'all a lot of trouble.
Maya:
Well, memory is a tricky, vague little thing.
Lotta:
Yeah, I sure know that now. I'll be fine the next time I witness a murder!
Maya:
Right!
Phoenix:
(You mean the FIRST time you witness a murder...)




Gourdy

What about Gourdy?
Lotta:
Right! Well, the way I figure, the trial's only stoking the flames of Gourdy fever! I'll get my exclusive photos and rocket to stardom!

Making it up







Phoenix:
Lotta, what do you mean by "making it up to us"?
Lotta:
Well, ya see... Actually, I got a bit of information for you.
Maya:
What!?
Lotta:
That von Karma didn't want me to say nothin' about it.
Maya:
Wh-what information!?
Lotta:
Now we're getting to the heart of it! See, I reckoned we might be able to do ourselves a little "exchange."
Phoenix:
E-"exchange"? Umm... I thought this was to "make it up to us"...?
Lotta:
Right! I propose a little exchange, to make it up to you!
Phoenix:

Lotta:
What!? Information don't come cheap, my friend!

Maya:
Wh-what should we do, Nick?



Deal







Phoenix:
(We don't have any other leads so I don't think we have a choice here...) Okay. How much?
Lotta:
Huh? You completely off your rocker? I may not be sophisticated, but I'm not trying to rob the poor!
Leads to:
"Huh?"




No deal







Phoenix:
I'm sorry... But I've no intention of dealing with you!

Maya:
Umm... uh... You know, I was wondering...
Lotta:
Yeah?
Maya:
What if you get a picture of Gourdy... and it turns out like this enlargement did?
Lotta:
Y'all crazy!? A blurry picture like this doesn't make a hit story! I need a picture that screams "I am Gourdy! Hear me roar!" I can't turn something like this into the paper! What kind of fool do y'all think I am?
Phoenix:

Flags







Phoenix:
Those flags look sadly out of place here. Flapping listlessly back and forth in a cold wind under a cold sky...

I dunno, I think it kind of gives the place a festival atmosphere. It reminds me of the "War of the Eyeglasses"!

Hey, Larry, did you know Edgeworth's secret weakness? He's terrified of earthquakes! He acts like a little boy!
Butz:
Huh? That's weird. I don't think he was ever like that in school.
Maya:
No? Really?
Butz:
Well, we were only in the same class for a year. He transferred schools pretty quickly...

Detective







Phoenix:
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
Police:
"Resistance is futile! We have you surrounded! It's not too late... Release the hostages and come out with your hands up."

The flying air tank (after selecting "Is it yours?", then "To inflate something", then "Ask more about the tank" upon presenting Air Tank)







Maya:
Umm... So, the tank and the Steel Samurai you were trying to fill up flew away... What happened next?
Butz:
Well, all that happened on the 20th or so.
Phoenix:
(The 20th... a week ago.)
Butz:
Now, as far as I could see, the tank went flying out into the lake. So I went out every night in a boat looking for it. I mean, Kiyance gave me that Steel Samurai after all!
Maya:
And when did you find it?
Butz:
Just the night before last! It flew way out there! Took me four whole days to find it.
Phoenix:
(The night before last... was the night of the murder!)
Butz:
Sorry for not telling you, Nick. Actually, I was here on the night of the murder. But, you see, I went home before midnight.
Maya:
So you didn't know about what happened?
Butz:
No...
Maya:
That's too bad...
Phoenix:
It's not all bad. We've solved one mystery at least.
Maya:
A mystery...?
Phoenix:
(Maybe we should go tell her...)Present









Air Tank







Butz:
What? An air tank? What about it?
Phoenix:
Larry... I wanted to ask you about this tank...



Have you seen it before?







Phoenix:
Have you seen this before?
Butz:
Huh? Me? N-no. Never. Who the heck would go diving in the middle of the winter!
Phoenix:
(There's something about the way his eye twitched when I showed him the tank... I think I'd better pursue this line of questioning a little further...)
Leads back to Court Record




Is it yours?







Phoenix:
Say... is this air tank yours?
Butz:
Wh-why would I have a thing like that?
Phoenix:
Look--see how there's a string of flags around the tank valve? It's just like the string of flags around your Steel Samurai there.
Butz:
...! M-must be a coincidence! There's strings of flags everywhere these days! L-like elementary schools! A-and used car dealerships! L-look, why would I need a tank anyway!?



To inflate something







Phoenix:
You used this to inflate that, didn't you?
Butz:
I-inflate what!?
Phoenix:
What else? That big puffy Steel Samurai!
Butz:
!!! ... N-now why would you go asking me a question like that.
Phoenix:
(Looks like I hit the nail on the head.)
Butz:
... Right... right... Actually, umm... See, the compressor I always use was on the fritz. So I tried using the tank to inflate it, just once. And, er, it didn't go so well.
Phoenix:
(As I suspected!)



Put the tank away







Phoenix:
(I guess I've gotten to the bottom of that mystery!)
Butz:
Heh. Sorry!
Leads back to Court Record




Ask more about the tank







Phoenix:
It "didn't go so well"?
Butz:
Er, yeah.
Phoenix:
Do you think you could be a little more specific?
Butz:
C-c'mon...  Look, it's embarrassing so I really don't want to talk about it...
Maya:
Tell us! Tell us!
Butz:
... Fine. Whatever. It's like what I said, the compressor was busted. So I took the tank and tried to fill the Samurai up with that. And then...


BLAAAAM!

Butz:
The valve busted open and made this incredible noise! And that tank there took off like a rocket. And it took my poor deflated Steel Samurai with it!
Maya:
What!? Off into Gourd Lake?
Butz:
It sure scared me out of my gourd, that's for sure.
Adds Talk option "The flying air tank"





To go diving







Phoenix:
You used this to go diving in the lake, didn't you?
Butz:
Wh-wh-what!? Why the heck would I go diving in the lake!? Wait! You... you're not... You're not saying I had something to do with that murder!?
Phoenix:
N-no, not at all, just...
Butz:
Hey, you watch it buddy! I'm not saying anything until my lawyer gets here!
Maya:
Larry... Nick is your lawyer.
Phoenix:
Well, Larry? She's right.
Butz:
Bah! A-anyway, I never seen that air tank! Okay?
Phoenix:
(Yeah, right... Larry is hiding something, I can tell...)
Leads back to Court Record






Air Tank (after selecting "Is it yours?", then "To inflate something", then "Ask more about the tank" upon presenting Air Tank)







Butz:
See, I tried to use this tank to fill up the Samurai. I was attaching the tank, when it happened!


BLAAAAM!

Butz:
The valve just busted open and the whole thing took off! The tank shot up in the air like a rocket... And it took my poor deflated Steel Samurai with it! Man, what a sight that was.
Maya:
I wish I could have seen it!
Phoenix:
Me too.Gourd Lake WoodsTalk









Gourdy







Lotta:
Well, Mister Lawyer? I've got the info y'all need! Y'all got the scoop on Gourdy for me yet?



Nothing yet

Y-y'all for real!? Gourdy really exists!? Wait! I need proof! You get a photo!?



I have proof







Phoenix:
Of course I have proof.
Maya:
No fair, Nick! It was when I went to the bathroom, wasn't it!? That's when you made contact with Gourdy!
Lotta:
Enough jabbering already, let's see your proof!



Present Air Tank (after clearing "The flying air tank" Talk option in Gourd Lake - Public Beach)







Phoenix:

Maya:
Larry's air tank...?
Lotta:
What're y'all doing with an air tank?
Phoenix:
This... is Gourdy.
Lotta:
Umm... scuze me?
Maya:
Wh-what exactly are you saying, Nick?
Phoenix:
There's a stand near here... a hotdog stand. There's a giant inflatable samurai doll there. About a week ago, an idiot, who happens to be a friend of mine, tried to fill it. He used this air tank, and when the valve blew, the tank flew into the lake. Apparently, it made a pretty loud "bang" when it flew...
Lotta:
A "bang"...?
Phoenix:
The tank, along with the still deflated Samurai fell into the lake. At the same time... A couple was taking a photograph of the lake. This photo!
Maya:
Wait... So... you're saying that Gourdy... Is really the Steel Samurai!?
Lotta:
... ... Well, that's a fine way to ruin a gal's dreams.
Phoenix:
I'm sorry, Lotta.
Lotta:
Nah, it's okay, you win. I'll give you your info, like I promised.

Y'all got some proof Gourdy don't exist!?
Phoenix:
The proof that Gourdy doesn't exist...

Table







Maya:
Look, Nick, he has an electric blanket on his table! Looks warm! That's a great idea, we should do that at the office. We can sit down with our clients, snug and warm, and drink hot cocoa!

However... If you can convince me somehow that the DL-6 Incident is related to this case... Well, I guess I'd consider opening the file up.Present









Metal Detector







Phoenix:
Thanks, Detective Gumshoe. This was really helpful.
Gumshoe:
R-really?
Maya:
You seem surprised!
Gumshoe:
Huh? N-no, not at all. Glad it worked out for you.




Parrot







Gumshoe:
What's that? A parrot?
Phoenix:
The old man at the boat rental shop's parrot. The parrot knew about that "incident"...
Gumshoe:
That incident?
Phoenix:
DL-6.
Gumshoe:
Wh-what!?


Maya:
Polly! Polly! Have we forgotten something?
Parrot:
*squawk* "Don't forget DL-6!" *squawk*
Maya:
H-huh!?


Phoenix:
I'm pretty sure that old man must have taught her that word...
Gumshoe:
Yeah, but how would that old man know about the DL-6 Incident?
Phoenix:
Wait! What if... What if that old man was connected to DL-6?
Maya:
N-Nick! You think he might be!?
Gumshoe:
...After clearing all Talk options and presenting Parrot:Gumshoe:
... I get ya. Sounds like you need information on the DL-6 Incident. Through there is the Station's Records Room. I'll give you special permission to go in and find what you need.Maya:
All right! Way to go, Detective Gumshoe! Okay, Nick! To the Records Room!Phoenix:
(I guess it's time we faced Edgeworth's past...)December 26Police DepartmentRecords RoomMaya:
Wow!!! It's amazing.........ly dusty.Phoenix:
Ten years of files and ten years of dust, I guess.Maya:
Let's find that DL-6 stuff quick!Phoenix:
(Fifteen years ago... both me and Edgeworth were nine years old. We were almost through with fourth grade when he suddenly transferred. Because of DL-6...?)Maya:
Nick! I found out where the file is!Phoenix:
O-oh, thanks!Maya:
Just let me know what you want to know about the DL-6 Incident! I'll go get the right file!Examine









Glass case







Phoenix:
It looks like there are files inside that glass case. The case is so dusty I can't see what's inside.
Maya:
Nick... it's locked.
Phoenix:
They must keep important case files in there.




Back wall







Phoenix:
There are shelves stuffed with case files in the back of the room, too. Forgotten cases, rotting away for eternity...
Maya:
Nick, let's get what we need and get out of here. All this dust is getting to me!




Cabinet







Phoenix:
This cabinet is where they keep evidence for current cases. Some of the things are obviously murder weapons. Others are... who knows what. Most of it just looks like random junk.
Maya:
Nick... what do you think this clothespin is for?
Phoenix:
Don't touch that! It's evidence...




Shelves







Phoenix:
Here are files of collected case reports. There's quite a large volume of reports here.
Maya:
Wow... these are all case reports!?
Phoenix:
Yeah. It's like a graveyard of police cases.
Maya:
I guess my sister's case report is in here too... quietly gathering dust.Talk









The case summary







Phoenix:
Well, first I have to get a handle on the main facts... like a summary.
Maya:
Right. Summary... summary... Found it! Here you go.
Phoenix:
December 28... 2001.
Maya:
That's exactly 15 years ago from the day after tomorrow!
Phoenix:
(So in two days, the case is closed...) The incident took place in the elevator of the district courthouse. (Changed from [The incident took place in the elevator of the district court.] in the original release)
Maya:
What!? Is this the same district courthouse where we're holding the trial now!? (Changed from [Is this the same district court where we're holding the trial now!?] in the original release)
Phoenix:
Looks like it. There was a large earthquake at 2:00 PM on that day. Part of the court building collapsed, and all of the lights went out.
Maya:
Wow... that was some earthquake!
Phoenix:
At the time, three people were trapped in the elevator. It took five hours for them to be rescued... Five hours!
Maya:
That would be scary like that, in the dark!
Phoenix:
There was a lack of oxygen in the elevator, and the survivors were unconscious.
Maya:
The survivors...?
Phoenix:
One of the three in the elevator had been shot... in the heart.
Maya:
That was Mr. Edgeworth's father... wasn't it.
Phoenix:
(He said that his father was shot before his very eyes... So Miles Edgeworth was one of the other passengers in that elevator.)




Victim data







Phoenix:
Do you have data on the victim... Edgeworth's father?
Maya:
Yeah, hold on... Victim... victim... Here! Found it!
Phoenix:
Gregory Edgeworth, 35, defense attorney. If he were still alive, he'd be 50. He had lost that day's case in court, and got in the elevator with his son, Miles.
Maya:
"Miles"...!
Phoenix:
Miles Edgeworth, of course.
Maya:
So he was on the elevator with his father!
Phoenix:
From the angle of the bullet and the other evidence, it could not have been a suicide... The murder weapon, a pistol, was found in the elevator. The pistol had been fired two times. (Where have I heard that before...? Huh...! It sounds just like this current case! What's going on here?)




Suspect data







Phoenix:
Got any data on the suspect in there?
Maya:
Hmm... that would be the guy that my mom got arrested. Hold on... this is it.
Phoenix:
The man arrested as a suspect in DL-6 was... Yanni Yogi? He was a clerk in the court, apparently.
Maya:
So he must have been the third person in the elevator. Well, then he had to have done it!
Phoenix:
But... he was found innocent. Thanks to his defense lawyer, Robert Hammond.
Maya:
Hammond... the victim in our case!
Phoenix:
Right. The suspect, Mr. Yogi was oxygen deprived... so much so he had brain damage. He lost all memory of being in the elevator. After he was declared innocent, he disappeared.
Maya:
Hmm... where could Yogi have gone to, I wonder?
Phoenix:
(He may be closer than we think...)Present









Anything







Maya:
Let's just hurry up and read these files! This place is so dusty, I want to finish up and get out of here...After clearing all Talk options:Phoenix:
I guess I know generally what happened in DL-6 now. I still don't know what sort of impact the whole thing had on Edgeworth...Maya:
Nick. Are we going to take the whole file? There's too much! We'll never get it out.Phoenix:
Y-you're right. How about we just take what we think we'll need...DL-6 Case File added to the Court Record.Phoenix:
Right. That's probably all we'll be able to find here. Now, all that's left is the trial tomorrow... I wonder how "Dad" will do testifying in court...To be continued.Nothing to examine during investigation







Phoenix:
No clues here.Turnabout Goodbyes

Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Miles Edgeworth.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.Karma:
... ...Judge:
Very well, apparently the prosecution is also ready.Phoenix:
(Who is the judge here, anyway!?)Judge:
Mr. von Karma, your opening statement.Karma:
... ...Judge:
Er... very well, no opening statement so...Karma:Karma:
Not so fast, Judge! I was taking a meaningful pause before speaking!Judge:
R-right, of course.Karma:
A prediction! Today's trial will end three minutes from now!Judge:
Order... order! Mr. von Karma! What is the meaning of your statement just now!?Karma:Karma:
Bah! Must you question everything! It will be over in three minutes! We have no time to waste! I'll call my witness now!Judge:
R-right...Karma:
I call my witness... my decisive witness to the stand!Phoenix:
(It's that mysterious boat shop owner.)Karma:
Witness... state your profession.Uncle:
Mmph... zzzz... ... I, er, am the proprietor of the restaurant the "Wet Noodle" at Gourd Lake.Karma:
...Uncle:
And I, er, also rent boats.Karma:
The night of the incident, you were in the boat rental shop, correct?Uncle:
Er... ayup, yup I was.Karma:
Please testify.Phoenix:
(Wait a second... We still haven't heard who this old guy is!)Raise an objection







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Wait a minute!"Let it slide







Phoenix:
(On second thought, I guess it doesn't really matter.)
Maya:
Doesn't matter!? What are you thinking, Nick!? What if that old man had something to do with the DL-6 Incident? If we don't find out who he is, we won't be able to build a case here!
Phoenix:
(Hmm, she has a point.)
Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Wait a minute!"Phoenix:
Wait a minute! The witness hasn't stated his name yet!Karma:Karma:
Because I did not ask him, Mr. Wright! Bah! I have predicted this trial will end in three minutes! Stop asking trivial questions and cooperate!Phoenix:
(Yeah, right!)Judge:
The witness will state his name.Uncle:
Zzzz... ... Mmph! Well, er... I'm not really sure, ayup.Judge:
What do you mean?Uncle:
My, er, memory...Karma:
Your Honor... The witness does not remember anything beyond the last several years... Ergo, he cannot recall his own name.Judge:
Hmm... he can't recall, you say?Karma:
Yes, but the incident in question took place three days ago. He can testify.Judge:
Very well. Let's hear his testimony then, shall we. Witness?Witness Testimony-- The Night of the Murder --Uncle:
It was the night of the 24th, just after midnight, ayup.
I was in the restaurant... where I er... rent boats, as usual.
Then I heard a "bang!" Ayup.
When I looked out the window, I saw a boat just a' floating on the lake.
Then I heard another "bang."
Just about then the boat comes back to the shore, and a man walks by my window.Judge:
Hmm...Very well. I'd like to begin the cross-examination...Karma:Karma:
There is nothing to question in my witness's testimony! Ergo, no need for cross-examination! Besides, there are only 10 seconds left before our three minutes are up! Judge! Your verdict, now!Judge:
Er... yes... M-Mr. Wright...?Cross-examine







Phoenix:
What are you saying!? Of course I'll cross-examine the witness!
Judge:
Hmm... Very well, you may begin.
Leads to:
"Raaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!"Don't cross-examine







Phoenix:
(He's right. That testimony sounded pretty solid. Maybe I should hold back.)
Maya:
B-but, Nick! You have to cross-examine him! This is your only chance to turn this trial around! Your last chance!
Phoenix:
(O-oh... right.)
Leads to:
"Raaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!"Karma:
Raaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!Judge:
E-excuse me? Mr. von Karma?Karma:
Three minutes just passed.Judge:
I see. Well then, let's just take our time. You may cross-examine the witness.Cross Examination-- The Night of the Murder --Uncle:
It was the night of the 24th, just after midnight, ayup.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
"Just after midnight," you say?
Uncle:
Ayup, just around then.
Phoenix:
Are you sure?
Uncle:
Pretty sure, ayup.
Phoenix:
When I talked to you yesterday, you were rather vague about the time... I'm surprised you seem so sure about it today.
Uncle:
...
Karma:

Karma:
I asked him, and he remembered. Isn't that right!?
Uncle:
Zzzz... D-don't glare at me like that...! I, er... I remembered it clearly, I did. Ayup.
Karma:
You see? Continue!Uncle:
I was in the restaurant... where I er... rent boats, as usual.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Is there anyone who can verify that?
Uncle:
... Well, I guess Polly could.
Phoenix:
Th-that's not good enough for a court of law!
Judge:
Mr. Wright... exactly what's not good enough?
Phoenix:
Ah, uh, Your Honor, this "Polly" is a parrot.
Judge:
A... parrot?
Uncle:
Don't be so hard on the girl, Keithy-boy!
Judge:
Keith...?
Karma:

Karma:
The prosecution concedes that we cannot prove the witness was in the shop. Witness... please continue.Uncle:
Then I heard a "bang!" Ayup.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
And where did the "bang" seem to come from?
Uncle:
From the lake, I figure.
Karma:
Are you certain?
Uncle:
A-ayup.
Karma:
Good. Continue!Uncle:
When I looked out the window, I saw a boat just a' floating on the lake.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Was there someone in the boat?
Uncle:
It was pretty far out there... I couldn't see clearly... But I figure there was two men out there, ayup.
Phoenix:
But you couldn't see them clearly!
Uncle:
Ayup... at the time, that is.
Phoenix:
(At the time...?)Uncle:
Then I heard another "bang."Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So you heard two gunshots total?
Uncle:
Ayup.
Phoenix:
(That's what Lotta said in her testimony yesterday.)Uncle:
Just about then the boat comes back to the shore, and a man walks by my window.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
"By your window"?
Uncle:
Ayup, by my window. Right outside the window of my little shack.
Phoenix:
And, could you see the man's face?
Uncle:
Well, the fog was pretty darn thick, but he was right there in front of me. I saw him.
Judge:
This is rather important detail! Please add it to your testimony.
Uncle:
...
Karma:
Tsk, tsk, tsk...
Phoenix:
(I have a bad feeling about this...)

That man was the defendant... he was saying "I can't believe he's dead."Press







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"A-are you sure!?"Phoenix:
(If I know von Karma, he spent time preparing his witness. I'm not going to find contradictions very easily in this testimony. Whew... it's tough being a lawyer.)Phoenix:
A-are you sure!?Uncle:
...Phoenix:
(Uh oh!) D-Dad!Uncle:
Dead certain, Keith! He said "I can't believe he's dead" as he was walking by, too.Karma:
Witness! Are you sure that the person you saw was Miles Edgeworth!?Uncle:
It was him! That Edgeworth boy!Judge:
... This... sounds like decisive evidence indeed. I see no room for doubt.Phoenix:
(von Karma... He lured me into cross-examining so he could set me up for a fall!)Karma:
Tsk, tsk, tsk...Maya:
N-Nick...! I don't like the way things are going here! Everyone in the courtroom is glaring at us!Phoenix:
(I'd better act quick, or this trial is going to be over!)Raise an objection







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Your Honor! We proved in yesterday's court that it could not have been Edgeworth who fired the gun!
Karma:

Karma:
Mr. Wright. Are you referring to the fingerprints from Edgeworth's right hand found on the gun, and the photograph showing a man firing with his left hand...?
Phoenix:
Exactly!
Karma:
That is easily explainable! He could have wiped his prints after he fired! You are ignoring the truth of the matter here! Everything in this witness's testimony is true!
Leads to:
"Hmm..."Wait and see what happens







Phoenix:
(But... how can I raise an objection without any proof?)
Karma:
Judge! There is no room for doubt in the witness's testimony! I demand that you declare your verdict!
Leads to:
"Hmm..."Judge:
Hmm...Phoenix:
(The judge is lost in thought... what should I do?)Raise an objection







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Your Honor! This witness claims that Edgeworth said "I can' t believe he's dead"... But his word is all we have! If he were telling a lie...
Karma:

Karma:
Mr. Wright. In a court of law, the evidence tells all. Apparently, you have yet to realize even this basic fact. If you say his testimony is a lie, show us proof!
Phoenix:
Urk...
Maya:
Nick! Do we have evidence...?
Leads to:
"It's no good! There's nothing I can do."Wait and see what happens







Phoenix:
(I can't see any room to raise an objection... I'd better hold back and see how things develop.)
Maya:
Nick! We have to do something! If we stay quiet now, Mr. Edgeworth'll be found guilty for sure!
Leads to:
"It's no good! There's nothing I can do."Phoenix:
It's no good! There's nothing I can do.Maya:
A... are you sure?Phoenix:
To be honest... I don't know what to do anymore.Maya:
Please... Can you hear me, Sis? Please... We need your help... Nick needs you...Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... Three minutes was perhaps too high an expectation. However, fifteen minutes isn't bad! This must be a new record.Judge:
Enough! The witness may leave the stand.Uncle:
Zzzz...Judge:
This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts.Phoenix:
(W-what!? No!)Karma:
Hmph.Judge:
This court find the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth...GuiltyJudge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!W-w-waaaaaaait!Judge:

Huh? Waaaaah! L-Larry!Judge:
Wh-what are you doing here!?Butz:
Listen! Y-you gotta listen to me! I... I was...  I was there, in the park, the night of the murder! I... I wasn't sure about it until just yesterday. B-but today I remembered it!Judge:
Remembered what?Butz:
The gunshot! I heard it too!Judge:
O-order!Karma:Karma:
What is the meaning of this!? The verdict has been decided! I call for adjournment!Judge:
One moment, Mr. von Karma. So, you say you heard a gunshot?Butz:
Yeah, I did! A gunshot! That night! I was sitting here in the audience, listening to the testimony... Then I realized, something he said was different from what I remember! A-anyhow, I can't just sit here and let you call Edgey a murderer! It's... It's just not right! I'll testify! Lemme testify!Judge:
Order! Order! Well, this is the first time something has happened like this in my court. I'm not quite sure how to proceed...Karma:
Judge! You've already given your decision! The trial is over!Maya:
Nick! This is it! Larry's given us one final chance at this!Phoenix:
(She's right! If only it wasn't Larry... He could make things even worse...)Maya:
Mr. Edgeworth was just declared guilty, Nick! It doesn't get any worse!Phoenix:
You're right! Okay! Your Honor! If there is another witness, it is our duty to hear him speak! Right here! Right now!Karma:
A waste of time! The verdict cannot be overturned!Judge:
Hmm... ... ... Allow me to speak my opinion. In all court proceedings, it is our duty to prevent an inaccurate verdict. In order to make sure no mistake has been made, every witness should be heard!Karma:
Wh-what is this!?Judge:
I withdraw my previous verdict of "guilty"! Mr. von Karma! I order you to call this new witness to testify. Now!Karma:
Whaaaat!Judge:
The court will adjourn for a five minute recess. After that, we will hear this new witness. Court is adjourned!December 27, 10:28 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2Phoenix:
Whew... That was too close. Sorry to keep you on the edge of your seat like that, Edgeworth.Edgeworth:
Hmph. I've seen worse.Phoenix:
(Yeah right, Edgeworth. You're sweating bullets!) I just wonder what Larry plans to say in there.Maya:
Larry was at the lake that night?Phoenix:
Yes... He said he went looking for the Steel Samurai balloon that flew into the lake.Maya:
Oh right. And he found the balloon and the air tank that night?Phoenix:
Yeah.Edgeworth:
...Phoenix:
Hey, Edgeworth.Edgeworth:
... Huh? You say something, Wright?Phoenix:
Yeah, a lot of things. You seem out of it. What's wrong?Edgeworth:
It... it's nothing.Phoenix:
Hmm?Maya:
Umm... Mr. Edgeworth? There's something I've been meaning to ask you.Edgeworth:
What's that?Maya:
Why are your fingerprints on the murder weapon?Edgeworth:
Oh. When he fell into the lake, I went into a daze. I couldn't understand what had happened. I couldn't think straight. Then I saw the pistol lying on the floor of the boat in front of me. I picked it up without thinking. I didn't have a reason, really.Maya:
I see...Edgeworth:
Wright...Phoenix:
Yeah?Edgeworth:
This might be our chance.Phoenix:
Our chance?Edgeworth:
von Karma has only ever run perfect trials.Phoenix:
Perfect trials...?Edgeworth:
Perfectly prepared witnesses, perfectly complete evidence. That's the secret to his success. This is the first time he's ever had to deal with something unexpected! He has to let someone he hasn't even talked to testify before the court! (Changed from [He has let someone he hasn't even talked to testify before the court!] in the original release) And that someone... is Larry!Phoenix:
What are you getting at?Edgeworth:
It's likely his testimony will be full of holes, Wright.Maya:
That's right, Nick! No ten minute trial this time! We'll milk this one for all it's worth!Phoenix:
Hey, it was fifteen minutes! Fifteen! (Everything's on Larry now...) (Changed from [Hey, it was fifteen minutes! Fifteen! (Everything depends on Larry now...)] in the original release)December 27, 10:35 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:
Court is now back in session. Witness... Please testify to the court about everything that you saw... on the night of December 24th.Butz:
Right... leave it to me!Phoenix:
(Please, Larry, don't mess this one up!!! I hate to admit it, but you're our last chance!)Karma:
...Phoenix:
(von Karma didn't even have time to prep his witness. I just hope Edgeworth is right about this being our big break...)Witness Testimony-- The Night of the Murder --Butz:
That night, I was out in a boat on the lake.
I was looking for something and I, er, found it.
So I quietly slipped the boat back in at the rental shop dock.
Then, just as I was thinking about going home, I heard this "bang"!
I looked out over the lake, but I didn't notice the boat.
So after I heard that single gunshot I went home.Judge:
Hmm... That was an unusually vague testimony, even for this court. In any matter, Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor...Maya:
What's wrong, Nick?Phoenix:
It's Larry! I have no idea what he's going to say if I press him. I'm a little scared.Maya:
Hmm... Well, we've come this far. There's no way to go but forward, Nick!Cross Examination

Dare I ask why?Maya:\nDuh, Nick! Isn\'t it obvious? I need a waterfall to stand under! Preferably a freezing one!Phoenix:\n... Oh... Is that part of your spirit medium training?Maya:\nOf course! Except, I\'ve been slacking off lately... I need to brave the elements and be forged anew under the rushing spring waters!Phoenix:\nUmm... Okay... I don\'t know about any falls per se, but Gourd Lake is pretty close...Maya:\nOh. Darn.Phoenix:\nSorry, but them\'s the breaks. Couldn\'t you just take a cold shower or something?Maya:\n... Good idea!Phoenix:\n(So much for the rushing spring waters...)TV:\nNext in the news... A large, unidentified animal was sighted at Gourd Lake! The town is buzzing with excitement! Locals are calling it "Gourdy" in a tip of the hat to Nessie, the Loch Ness monster. Though its namesake, Nessie, proved to be a hoax... locals are confident their Gourdy is the real deal. ...Phoenix:\n*yawn* Bor-ing. Can\'t they show real news for a change?Maya:\nNick?Phoenix:\n?Maya:\nThe water pressure\'s kind of low in that shower.Phoenix:\n... You want more pressure, huh? Why don\'t you go down to the fire department and have them spray you with the hose?Maya:\n... Good idea, Nick!Phoenix:\n(Apparently, Fey blood is no aid in detecting sarcasm...) (Changed from [Apparently, E.S.P. is no aid in detecting sarcasm...] in the original release)TV:\nWe interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin! Strange occurrences continue at Gourd Lake... But this time, it\'s murder!Phoenix:\n(Gourd Lake again?)TV:\nThe body of a man was found in the lake early this morning. A suspect was apprehended. Sources inside the police department revealed... that the suspect\'s name is Miles Edgeworth, age 24. Edgeworth was an up-and-coming prosecution attorney, known for his skill and connections. He was guaranteed a long and rewarding career... Has he thrown it all away?Phoenix:\n(...? E-Edgeworth!?) What\'s going on!? Edgeworth would never do something like--Maya:\nNick?Phoenix:\nYipes! M-Maya!Maya:\nThe fireman yelled at me when I called him.Phoenix:\nWe\'ve got bigger things to worry about than that! They arrested Edgeworth!Maya:\nWhat? You mean, the prosecutor?Phoenix:\nYeah, he\'s a suspect... in a murder!Maya:\nWhaaaaat!? When? Where? Whom? Why? How?Phoenix:\nI-I don\'t know!Maya:\nLet\'s go find out, Nick!Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBookshelf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nDifficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. I tried reading one, and it made my head hurt. When I closed it, it slipped out of my hand. Then my foot hurt too.\n\n\n\n\nCharley the plant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMia\'s favorite plant. Its name is "Charley." Maya\'s gotten the knack of watering it lately. Charley\'s been perking up these days.\n\n\n\n\nDesk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMia\'s desk. If we had more clients, I would probably sit here more often. Lately, I\'ve been spending more time on the couch, watching TV.\n\n\n\n\nMovie poster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMaya brought in a poster of the Steel Samurai the other day. We had a big fight over whether to put it up or not. I know she\'s just waiting for a chance to sneak it up on the wall.\n\n\n\n\nWindow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nLooks like it\'s cleaning day again at the hotel across the way. I hear they\'re planning a second branch outside the city. I can see the bellboy, getting the angle of that screwdriver in the drawer just right.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to do\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, what should we do?\nMaya:\nWhat do you mean!? Let\'s investigate! We should talk to Mr. Edgeworth, and check out the crime scene!\nPhoenix:\n(You\'re right... We need more information! Save aimlessness and confusion for later!)\n\n\n\n\nAny ideas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell? Got any good ideas?\nMaya:\nNot really. I do my best thinking when I\'m standing underneath a waterfall.Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney\'s Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYou know, I think it\'s developing a nice luster.\nMaya:\nI\'ll look at your badge later, Nick.

We\'ve all been in here one time or another, haven\'t we?Phoenix:\nI guess it comes with the territory.Maya:\nI\'m not sure it\'s something we should mention to too many people... Aah!Phoenix:\n... Hey! Edgeworth! Come back!Edgeworth:\nWhat are you doing here!?Maya:\nNick, I don\'t think he\'s in a very good mood.Phoenix:\nWell, he is in detention. Were you in a good mood when you were here?Edgeworth:\nSo, you\'ve come to laugh at the fallen attorney? Then laugh, laugh! Well? Why aren\'t you laughing?Maya:\nNick... Should we be laughing?Phoenix:\nNah. It\'s a trick. Laugh and he\'ll get mad... or burst into tears. Edgeworth. We don\'t have so much free time we can spend it coming down here to laugh at you.Edgeworth:\n... Yes you do.Phoenix:\n(Actually, he\'s right.)Edgeworth:\n... I hoped you wouldn\'t come. I didn\'t want you to see me. Not like this.Phoenix:\n(I didn\'t want to see you like this, either. Believe me.)

He hasn\'t moved an inch since I came in. A real pro. Or maybe he\'s just nervous with Edgeworth in the room.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth. Tell me what happened.\nEdgeworth:\n... Why should I? What are you going to do about it?\nMaya:\nDuh! We\'re going to help you, that\'s what!\nEdgeworth:\n...! ... Help me? You? Don\'t be ridiculous.\nPhoenix:\nSorry...?\nEdgeworth:\nYou\'re a novice! You\'ve only been in three trials!\nPhoenix:\nH-hey!\nEdgeworth:\nSure, you got lucky and won all three... But your luck\'s bound to run out some day! You need real skill, Wright. Experience!\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nNick! He\'s insulting you! Nick? Why am I always the one who has to get angry!?\n\n\n\n\nGourd Lake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe murder took place at Gourd Lake, correct?\nEdgeworth:\nYes... late last night.\nPhoenix:\nThe lake is a long way away from your offices and the court... Why were you down there?\nEdgeworth:\n... I see no need to tell you.\nMaya:\nM-Mr. Edgeworth! You... you didn\'t really...?\nEdgeworth:\n... Gourdy.\nMaya:\nHuh?\nEdgeworth:\nI went to see Gourdy.\nMaya:\n"Gourdy"? What\'s that!?\nPhoenix:\nI\'ll... tell you later. (Why won\'t Edgeworth talk to us?)\n\n\n\n\nDid you do it (appears after "What happened", "Gourd Lake", and presenting Attorney\'s Badge)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth... this is really hard for me to ask... But... you didn\'t do it, right? Right?\nEdgeworth:\n... Think what you will. I have only one request.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEdgeworth:\nStay out of this case.\nMaya:\nWhy!? B-but Nick is trying to help you!\nEdgeworth:\nI know...! I know that! But I don\'t want your help, okay?\nMaya:\n\n\n\nWhy not?\nEdgeworth:\n... Look, just go away, and leave me alone!\nMaya:\nNick... Mr. Edgeworth did it, didn\'t he.\nPhoenix:\nMaya! Let\'s go investigate elsewhere.\nMaya:\nBut, Nick...Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney\'s Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYour attorney\'s badge...?\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth. Let me defend you.\nEdgeworth:\n... Hah! Hah hah! Good one, Wright. But I\'m not that hard up. Not yet.\nMaya:\nWh-what do you mean by that?\nEdgeworth:\nMe? Trust a wet-behind-the-ears lawyer with only three trials under his belt? Never!\nMaya:\nWh-what!?\nEdgeworth:\nMy case is near hopeless, Wright. Every defense attorney I\'ve talked to has turned me down.\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nEdgeworth:\nSimply put, they were afraid they\'d lose. It occurred to me that it might be my fault that they lack confidence. After all, I did get every single one of their clients declared "guilty."\nPhoenix:\nI don\'t believe it!\nEdgeworth:\nRegardless, I don\'t want you involved in this. You in particular I cannot ask to do this.December 25Gourd Lake ParkEntranceMaya:\nThis is where it happened?Phoenix:\nYeah. Gourd Lake is in the middle of this park.Maya:\nI can see some police walking around in there.Phoenix:\nQuestioning people, probably.Maya:\nHey! Isn\'t that Detective Gumshoe over there?Gumshoe:\nWell, pal!? There\'s enough of us here! Anyone found anything?Police:\nS-sorry, sir... Nothing.Gumshoe:\nIdiot! The trial\'s tomorrow! We need clues, on the double!Police:\nB-but, sir... There weren\'t any clues... that\'s why we arrested that attorney, Mr. Edgeworth! It\'s clear, sir. He\'s the one who--Gumshoe:\nShaddup! Just you try saying that again! I\'ll... I\'ll... I\'ll make you sorry if you do! (Changed from [I\'ll... er... I\'ll make you sorry if you do!] in the original release) So just... just, get outta my face, pal!

Aah!Maya:\nEek!Gumshoe:\nHey, you\'re that Harry guy! Harry Butz!Phoenix:\nWright! Phoenix Wright! (Will he ever learn my name!?)Gumshoe:\nAnd just what are you doing here, pal? Investigating!?Phoenix:\nHuh? Um, well, yes. I suppose.Gumshoe:\nWell, I\'m here to help! Ask me anything you want! Bring it!Maya:\nHe seems different than usual. I wonder what\'s up? Umm... Mr. Edgeworth hasn\'t actually asked us to defend him yet...Gumshoe:\nHuh!? Oh? Y-you don\'t say...Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrees\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI feel winter\'s chill from the bare leaf trees today... *sigh* What is it about winter that turns people into poets?\nMaya:\nI don\'t know, but my toes are starting to feel numb.\nPhoenix:\n(Yes... my poetry has that effect on some people.)\n\n\n\n\nSign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe sign says "Gourd Lake Nature Park." This place is full of families picnicking on the weekend.\nMaya:\nBut... no waterfall.\nPhoenix:\nNot many picnickers come here for spiritual training, Maya.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe? Do you know what happened here?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? You don\'t know, pal?\nPhoenix:\nNo...\nGumshoe:\nWow, okay, Mr. Head-in-the-fluffy-pink-clouds Lawyer.\nPhoenix:\nHead-in-the... huh?\nGumshoe:\nNever mind, I\'ll tell you. It happened last night, about 15 minutes after midnight. There was a boat out on Gourd Lake. In that boat were two men. One of those men shot the other with a pistol.\nMaya:\nAnd... the shooter was Mr. Edgeworth?\nGumshoe:\nA cop who arrived on the scene arrested him.\nMaya:\nHow did they get there so fast? (Changed from [How did he get there so fast?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nWell... There was a witness. When the report came in, we raced to the lake.\nPhoenix:\nA witness?\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nYou don\'t think Mr. Edgeworth is a... murderer, do you!? (Changed from [You don\'t think Mr. Edgeworth is a... murderer!?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nAbsolutely not! It\'s impossible! I don\'t care if there\'s a witness either! I don\'t believe a lick of it!\nMaya:\nR-right! Who cares what the witness says!\nPhoenix:\n(I care!)\nMaya:\n... You really believe in him, don\'t you, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nCourse I do! But... the police are pretty sure he\'s the killer. Nobody\'s even really taking this investigation that seriously.\nMaya:\nOh no!\nGumshoe:\nAfter all the help Mr. Edgeworth has been to us... Hard to imagine that no one\'s standing up to take his side.\nMaya:\nWell, at least you are, Detective. At least you are.\n\n\n\n\nDefense request\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nDo you know who will be Mr. Edgeworth\'s defense attorney in tomorrow\'s trial?\nGumshoe:\nHe hasn\'t got one yet.\nMaya:\nWhat? The trial IS tomorrow, isn\'t it?\nGumshoe:\nWell, I don\'t know the whole story... But apparently no one he\'s been talking to will take his case.\nMaya:\nW-why not?\nGumshoe:\nMr. Edgeworth won\'t tell me! When you guys showed up, I figured he\'d asked you to defend him.\nPhoenix:\nU-unfortunately not...\nGumshoe:\nWell, pal, then you got a job to do! Help out Mr. Edgeworth! Prove that badge you wear isn\'t just some fancy piece of metal! Prove it to me, pal! Show me you\'re an attorney!\n\n\n\n\nDefense request (after presenting Attorney\'s Badge in Detention Center - Visitor\'s Room)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nI-is it true? No one will take Mr. Edgeworth\'s case?\nGumshoe:\nYeah... He\'s a bit of a celebrity. If you defended him, and lost, your reputation\'d be sure to suffer. What\'s more... The case against him is... well, it\'s pretty solid.\nPhoenix:\n(I suppose it would be if they have a witness.)\nGumshoe:\nHey! Pal! Don\'t tell me your going to turn your back on him too!? Remember the Steel Samurai case? (Changed from [Remember the Steel Samurai!] in the original release) Mr. Edgeworth helped you get your client declared innocent!\nPhoenix:\nI... I know. I went to Edgeworth. I tried. He really doesn\'t want us to represent him. Especially not us, he said.\nGumshoe:\nWhat!? W-well, that doesn\'t make any sense, pal! You should have heard him talking about you after that trial! (Changed from [You should have heard him talking about you after the Steel Samurai case!] in the original release) He kept saying "Wright, Wright, Wright," over and over.\nMaya:\n... Nick? I\'m not sure that\'s a good sign.\nPhoenix:\nNeither am I...\nGumshoe:\nWhy wouldn\'t he want your help? I don\'t get it.\n\n\n\n\nThe witness (appears after "What happened")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWho was this witness?\nGumshoe:\nEr, sorry, pal. That\'s confidential. Anyway, the witness saw everything, apparently. I\'m sure they\'ll turn up at the trial tomorrow.\nPhoenix:\nWas there only that one witness?\nGumshoe:\nYep. It was pretty cold out on the lake last night. And, it was Christmas Eve after all. Still, we\'re being thorough. You never know when you\'re going to turn up another witness. That\'s why we\'re here today, checking things out. So far, we\'re coming up empty...\nMaya:\nOh! It\'s Christmas today! I\'d forgotten. What are you getting me for Christmas, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nTalk to Santa.Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney\'s Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThat badge! You\'re showing that to the wrong guy, pal!

But there was a call from the precinct. They want to hold an investigation briefing...Gumshoe:\nA briefing? Right! I\'m off! Oh... Sorry, pal. I guess you heard. I gotta go. Any last things you want to ask me about before I head back?The autopsy report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nWell, yes. Do you have any information on the victim...?\nGumshoe:\nSorry... They haven\'t worked up the autopsy report yet. I\'m still waiting for it myself. Actually... Say, if you get the time, drop by the precinct! We can talk more there, pal!\nLeads to:\n"You\'re not coming back, Detective?"How to get in touch with you\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n"You\'re not coming back, Detective?"Phoenix:\nYou\'re not coming back, Detective?Gumshoe:\nErm... Probably not, pal.Phoenix:\nSo, what should we do if we have something to talk to you about...?Gumshoe:\nAh, right. Here, I\'ll show you how to get to the precinct. Come down and see me anytime.Detective Gumshoe gave you directions to the police station.Phoenix:\nOh, hey! Detective Gumshoe!Gumshoe:\nW-what!?Phoenix:\nUm, we\'d like to take a look around in the park. Can we walk around?Gumshoe:\nYeah! No problem, pal. You got my permission.Maya:\nYou know, Nick. I think there\'s something to be said for talking to people when they\'re busy.Phoenix:\nYeah. They don\'t have time to think about not giving you information...Maya:\nRight! Now, let\'s get investigating!December 25Police DepartmentCriminal AffairsMaya:\n... Looks like Detective Gumshoe isn\'t here.Chief:\nSomething wrong, miss? Hmm? Turning yourself in?

He\'s in a meeting right now. I don\'t think he\'ll be out any time soon.Maya:\nOkay, we\'ll come back.Chief:\nYou do that. Oh, and go straight home and stay out of trouble.

That\'s the latest "Babes in Uniform" calendar. My bad.\n\n\n\n\nDetective\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThat must be one of the detectives. He\'s mumbling something to himself.\nPolice:\n"...your mama could see you know she\'d be crying\'... ...a break and spit it out, you lowlife scumbag..."\nPhoenix:\n... He must be doing image training for interrogations.\n\n\n\n\nDesk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThese are the detectives\' desks. There are computers and files on each one.

I bet they\'re great!Phoenix:\nWith a name like Samurai Dog, how could they not be?Maya:\nThey\'re a little behind the times, though. The kids are all into "The Pink Princess" now.

Why is it called "Gourd Lake"?\nPhoenix:\nOh. Well, a long time ago, they used to grow gourds here.\nMaya:\nWhoa! No way! I was sure it was because the lake looked like a gourd when viewed from above! You know, like an hourglass shape?\nPhoenix:\nWell, it is shaped like a gourd, actually. But that\'s just a coincidence.\nMaya:\nOh. Okay.\n\n\n\n\nTrash can\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe trashcan is empty.

I guess a murder taking place on one of the boats won\'t be good for business, either.Maya:\nBoats... I\'ve never ridden on a boat.Phoenix:\nReally?

Yeah, his methods might be a little extreme at times. But... there\'s a reason! He trusts our investigation, see? He trusts us to get the right man! That\'s why I work extra hard, pal.

Oh, you mean the Samurai Dogs?\nMaya:\nW-why are they Samurai Dogs? I... I mean they kind of look gourd-shaped.\nButz:\nOh, well originally, they were Gourd Dogs! Y\'know, like "guard dogs"?\nMaya:\nOuch...\nButz:\nThe Samurai thing was Kiyance\'s idea. Oh, she\'s my woman, y\'know. She was all "change the name and you go girlfriend!" She made me that banner! Man, the kids can\'t get enough of those Samurai Dogs!\nMaya:\nErr... Something about that just seems... wrong.\nButz:\nOh, and guess what?

I never knew.\nButz:\nDon\'t get me wrong. He\'s always been kind of a stick in the mud. Studying all the time, trying to "be like father."\nMaya:\nLike his father...?\nButz:\nYeah. Edgey\'s pop was a famous defense lawyer back in the day.\nMaya:\nWow. Wait... You said "defense lawyer"?\nButz:\nYeah.\nMaya:\nWait a second! But Mr. Edgeworth is a prosecuting attorney!\nButz:\nWhat? Edgey\'s got a proboscis on his knee!?\nMaya:\nNo, no--he\'s a "prosecuting attorney." That\'s like the total opposite of a defense lawyer!\nButz:\n... Huh. Go figure! He always used to talk about defending the "weak" who were "unable to defend themselves." Man, he used to go on and on about man\'s duty to society and all that. What a bore! I wonder what changed his mind, though?

It\'s r-really real! Nick! A monster! A real monster!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... yeah. (It\'s probably just a log or something... right?) Hey... there\'s a quote here from the person who took the photo. Hmm?

Wait... you don\'t mean? Was that medium my mother?\nGrossberg:\nYes, my dear. The spirit medium, Misty Fey, your mother, contacted the spirit of the victim. But... the case was a loss.

Right before my eyes... He was shot and killed, and I saw it all.\nMaya:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nMy memories from that time are... foggy. I suppose it\'s a self-defense mechanism. In any case, a suspect was arrested... a man. It\'s pretty clear he was the only one who could have killed my father. The spirit medium they used to talk to my late father said the same thing. It was an attorney by the name of Robert Hammond that cleared the suspect\'s name.\nPhoenix:\nAnd Hammond... is the victim in the Gourd Lake murder?\nEdgeworth:\nCorrect.\nMaya:\nUmm... That spirit medium... that was my mom.\nEdgeworth:\nWhat? You mean you\'re...? ... It\'s strange.

The one who got off innocent?\nEdgeworth:\nI don\'t know... He disappeared from public view. Nobody knows where to. If he\'s still alive, he\'d be about 50 years old now.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I can understand why he\'d go into hiding... It\'d be hard to live a normal life after being a murder suspect in such a big case.)\n\n\n\n\nYour father (appears after "The DL-6 Incident")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nUmm... so, was your father a lawyer?\nEdgeworth:\nHe was...

Once you start on something, you always see it through, don\'t you?\nPhoenix:\nAbout the "DL-6 Incident"...\nEdgeworth:\nRight... DL-6. I didn\'t want you to find out about it. That is why I refused your offer to defend me. I\'m sorry if it sounded like I thought you weren\'t up to the job. I just wanted to keep you away from DL-6.\nPhoenix:\nSo... do you still think it would have been better for me to stay away?\nEdgeworth:\nI don\'t know. But...

Is he royalty or something?Phoenix:\nHow am I supposed to fight against this!?Karma:\nI call the detective in charge of this case, Detective Dick Gumshoe.Phoenix:\n(Okay, Gumshoe\'s first... Let\'s see how this goes.)Karma:\nDescribe the incident. Now!Gumshoe:\nY-yessir!Phoenix:\n(Detective Gumshoe looks nervous...)Gumshoe:\nEr, please take a look at the map. The murder happened late Christmas Eve, around midnight. There was one boat in the very middle of the lake. There were two men on the boat. Now, there happened to be a woman camping here on the edge of the lake. At 12:10 AM, she heard two pistol shots. Then the boat started to move. It went towards the boat rental shop.Karma:\nHmm.Overhead Map added to the Court Record.Karma:\nTestify to the court about your arrest. Now!Judge:\nW-w-wait! Mr. von Karma...Karma:\nYes?Judge:\nActually, I\'m the one that\'s supposed to be handling these proceedings...Karma:\nWrong. There is only one thing you need to do here. You will slam down your gavel and say the word "guilty." That is your role!Judge:\nY-yes, of course. You\'re quite right.Phoenix:\n(No, he\'s not!!!)Witness Testimony-- The Arrest of Edgeworth --Gumshoe:\nA man called into the station around 30 minutes after midnight.\nWe headed to the scene of the crime as fast as we could.\nThat\'s where we found Mr. Edgeworth.\nNow, I didn\'t suspect him of anything at all.\nBut... the next morning, a body was found in the lake.\nSo we had to arrest Mr. Edgeworth.Judge:\nHmm... I see. Very well...Karma:\nBegin your cross-examination, attorney. Now!Judge:\n...Cross Examination-- The Arrest of Edgeworth --Gumshoe:\nA man called into the station around 30 minutes after midnight.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou received a call from a "man"?\nGumshoe:\nEr... yup.\nPhoenix:\nBut you said there was a woman camping there? She was the one who heard the two gunshots, right?\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nThat woman and the "man" who called in the report are two different people, obviously!\nPhoenix:\nDifferent people?\nKarma:\nThere were two witnesses!\nPhoenix:\n(Urk!)\nKarma:\nTheir testimonies were quite similar however. Today I\'ve summoned the woman who was camping.\nPhoenix:\n(The woman who was camping... Lotta Hart.)\nKarma:\nWhat happened next, Detective?Gumshoe:\nWe headed to the scene of the crime as fast as we could.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow long was it between receiving the report and your arrival at the lake?\nGumshoe:\nEr, well... I\'d say it was about three minutes.\nPhoenix:\nThat\'s pretty fast!\nGumshoe:\nOur motto for the month is "get there quick."\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nDetective! You will refrain from casually revealing department secrets!\nGumshoe:\nY-yessir! Sorry, sir!\nKarma:\nDo that, and you\'ll be able to look forward to your next salary review.\nGumshoe:\nSo much to look forward to, these days...\nKarma:\nThis is no time for daydreaming! Continue!\nGumshoe:\nY-yessir!Gumshoe:\nThat\'s where we found Mr. Edgeworth.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat was Mr. Edgeworth like when you saw him then?\nGumshoe:\nWell... From what I saw, he looked pretty relaxed. Not like a murderer at all, really.\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nDetective! The court requires the facts, NOT your opinion! How many years have you been on the force!? Facts only, Detective! Hard, cold, objective facts!\nGumshoe:\nY-y-yessir!\nPhoenix:\n(Man, he\'s got his share of objections...)Gumshoe:\nNow, I didn\'t suspect him of anything at all.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy didn\'t you think he was suspicious?\nGumshoe:\nYou should know! We have a deep, trusting relationship with the prosecutors.\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nDetective! The court isn\'t interested in your musings! "Deep"? "Trusting"? Poppycock! I\'ve never heard so many flippant comments from an active detective on the force!\nGumshoe:\nMmph!\nPhoenix:\n(Detective Gumshoe doesn\'t look so good...)\nKarma:\nContinue! Now!Gumshoe:\nBut... the next morning, a body was found in the lake.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid you find any clues on the body?\nGumshoe:\nA single bullet was recovered from the body. He was shot through the heart... fatally.\nKarma:\nJudge! Here\'s the bullet... It didn\'t strike bone, so its shape is well preserved.\nJudge:\nVery well. The court accepts this bullet into evidence.\nPistol Bullet added to the Court Record.Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid you find any clues on the body?\nGumshoe:\nA single bullet was recovered from the body. He was shot through the heart... fatally.Gumshoe:\nSo we had to arrest Mr. Edgeworth.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nW-why is that?\nGumshoe:\nWell, we found the murder weapon in the boat.\nPhoenix:\nThe murder weapon...?\nGumshoe:\nA pistol.\nJudge:\nDetective Gumshoe... That is a vital piece of information. Please revise your testimony.\nGumshoe:\nRight! S-sorry, Your Honor.\nChanges statement from "So we had to arrest Mr. Edgeworth." to "The murder weapon we found in the boat was decisive evidence."Gumshoe:\nThe murder weapon we found in the boat was decisive evidence.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat about the pistol made it "decisive evidence"?\nKarma:\nTsk tsk tsk...\nPhoenix:\n(Ack! He has the same evil laugh as Edgeworth...)\nGumshoe:\nThere were fingerprints on the pistol found in the boat. They were clear prints from Mr. Edgeworth\'s right hand.\nPhoenix:\nWh-what!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! So Mr. Edgeworth\'s fingerprints were found on the murder weapon!?\nGumshoe:\nY-yes, Your Honor.\nKarma:\nJudge! This is the weapon in question.\nJudge:\nA-accepted into evidence.\nPistol added to the Court Record.Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat about the pistol made it "decisive evidence"?\nKarma:\nTsk tsk tsk...\nPhoenix:\n(Ack! He has the same evil laugh as Edgeworth...)\nGumshoe:\nThere were fingerprints on the pistol found in the boat. They were clear prints from Mr. Edgeworth\'s right hand.\nPhoenix:\nWh-what!?Maya:\nNick. Doesn\'t it seem like Detective Gumshoe is being a little vague?Phoenix:\nI bet von Karma is feeding him lines! His testimony\'s probably filled with landmines just waiting for me to press.Maya:\nWhat do we do?Phoenix:\nGrit our teeth and press, I guess. What else can we do?Maya:\nWell said, Nick! You\'re the man!After pressing fifth statement and pressing modified sixth statement:Karma:\nMembers of the court... We now have the pistol used in the murder, and the bullet found in the body! Detective!Gumshoe:\nY-y-yessir!Karma:\nWas the bullet found in the body fired from this pistol?Gumshoe:\nYes. The ballistic markings on the bullet match the pistol.Judge:\nHmm...Maya:\nHey, Nick! What does he mean, "ballistic markings"?Karma:\nShocking! To imagine someone here does not know something as basic as ballistic markings!Maya:\nN-Nick! He\'s glaring at me!Karma:\nTsk... very well, I\'ll explain. Actually, Judge! You do it.Judge:\nEh? M-me? ... Erm, ahem. Ballistic markings are like the "fingerprints" of a gun. The barrel leaves distinctive marks on each bullet it fires. You can examine these "ballistic fingerprints" to see which gun fired the shot. It\'s quite accurate.Karma:\nIndeed. This leads to one, inevitable conclusion: the bullet found in the victim\'s heart... was, without a doubt, fired from this pistol. This pistol which, as you may recall, was covered with the defendant\'s own fingerprints!Judge:\nO-order! Order!Phoenix:\n(This is bad... This makes it look like Edgeworth did it!)Karma:\nWell, Judge?Judge:\nI\'d say it\'s almost decisive, yes. Honestly, I could declare a verdict at this point. However...Karma:\nYou wish to hear the witness speak, no doubt. Very well. I am somewhat fatigued, and so I will take a brief break. I will call my witness after the recess. Which will last ten minutes. Judge!Judge:\nY-yes?Karma:\nWhat are you doing? A ten minute recess! Now!Judge:\nB-but, wait, I...Karma:\nJust bang your flimsy gavel and get on with it, man!Judge:\nY-yes! Ahem. This court will take a ten minute recess.Phoenix:\n(Who\'s running this court, anyway!?)December 26, 11:09 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2Phoenix:\nEdgeworth! What\'s going on here!? Your fingerprints were on the murder weapon!Edgeworth:\nUh... hmm...Phoenix:\nAnd that foggy photo makes one thing clear... The only one who could have shot that man was the person in the photo!Edgeworth:\nTrue...Phoenix:\nWas that you in the boat?Edgeworth:\n... Yes. It was me.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Edgeworth:\nBut... you must believe me. I didn\'t shoot him.Phoenix:\nTh-then who did!?Edgeworth:\nI... don\'t know.Phoenix:\nYou don\'t know!? Weren\'t you right there!?Edgeworth:\n... I heard a gunshot from very close by. Then... the other man fell from the boat. I can\'t say why, but... I thought, at the time, that he had shot himself!Phoenix:\nY-you mean it was a suicide!?Edgeworth:\n... That\'s the only explanation I can come up with.Phoenix:\nHuh... (How am I going to convince anyone of that!?) Say, Maya?Maya:\nHuh? Wh-what?Phoenix:\nAny progress with Mia?Maya:\nOh... Sorry. It\'s no good.Phoenix:\nUgh...Maya:\nI know... I\'m no good for anything, am I, Nick? If I can\'t call my sister, I might as well not be here, right?No, I need you here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nNo, of course not, I need you here! I can see you\'re always trying to help out. Even if you don\'t actually help... it\'s the thought that counts, right?\nMaya:\nIt\'s okay Nick, you don\'t have to make me feel better.\nLeads to:\n"I don\'t know anything about trials, or defense..."Yeah, you\'re useless\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm, well, actually... (You don\'t know law, you don\'t have any trial experience or techniques... Yeah, you\'re pretty much useless... but I can\'t say that!)\nMaya:\nIt\'s okay Nick. You don\'t have to say anything. Your face said it for you.\nPhoenix:\n(Whoops!) N-no, o-of course we... I\'m sorry.\nMaya:\nIt\'s okay Nick.\nLeads to:\n"I don\'t know anything about trials, or defense..."Maya:\nI don\'t know anything about trials, or defense... What\'s more, I\'m a spirit medium who can\'t even contact spirits...Phoenix:\nAww, everyone has their off days! I mean, I\'ve just been getting lucky lately... But you never know when my luck is going to run out!Maya:\nReally...?Edgeworth:\nW-w-whoa! Wright! Don\'t jinx this case any worse than it already is! It\'s bad for my heart...Phoenix:\nOh? Oh! S-sorry... (Whoops!)Judge:\nCourt is back in session. Mr. von Karma, call your witness.Karma:\nYes. Will Ms. Lotta Hart take the stand?Karma:\nLotta Hart, you are a research student at a university?Lotta:\nThat I am.Karma:\nGood. Begin by telling us what you saw the night of the incident. And don\'t add anything trivial or subjective. Understand?Lotta:\n... Y\'all need to learn some manners.Karma:\nUNDERSTAND?Lotta:\nY-yeah, I understand, I understand!Judge:\nEr... very well. Your testimony, please.Witness Testimony-- Witness\'s Account --Lotta:\nIt was Christmas Eve, just after midnight, I reckon.\nI was in my car.\nI heard this "bang" come up from the lake.\nWhen I looked out the window, I saw two gents in a boat.\nThen there was another "bang"...\nThere wasn\'t nary a thing on the lake but that boat.Karma:\nEnough.Lotta:\nHuh?Karma:\nJudge! She happened to take a photo of the incident! This is that photo. Accept it as evidence.Judge:\nW-well! This is a surprise! This looks like... the very moment of the murder! O-Order! I will remove you from the court if I do not have order immediately!Karma:\nAs the witness testified, she looked at the lake when she heard the shot. There were no other boats on that lake! So, the man in the boat with the victim must have been the one who shot him... Yes. It was the defendant, Miles Edgeworth!!!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order...! I will have order!Karma:\n... Well, Judge?Judge:\nThe evidence is... decisive. I have very little doubt about this case. Very well, this court finds the defendant...Phoenix:Phoenix:\nW-wait! Your Honor! I haven\'t cross-examined the witness yet!Karma:\nA cross-examination? We have photographic proof! What question can there possibly be!? This photo is worth a thousand words... and they all read "guilty"! You lose. Or... Do you claim to have found a contradiction in her testimony!?Phoenix:\n...!Karma:\nVery well. If you have to, you may cross-examine the witness. You will only flounder and ask meaningless questions! You will fail to find anything! And then, I will have you held in contempt of court!Maya:\nUh, Nick... contempt...?Phoenix:\n"Contempt of court," you know?Maya:\nI... guess I understand. Well... what are you going to do? Do you really think there was a contradiction with the facts in her testimony?I think there was\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI... think I noticed one little thing...\nMaya:\nWow, I\'m impressed, Nick! I didn\'t notice anything! Right! Let\'s take him on!\nPhoenix:\nY-yeah... (I got a bad feeling about this...)\nLeads to:\n"I understand... I will cross-examine the witness!"I think there wasn\'t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHonestly, I found nothing.\nMaya:\nI dunno, I thought her testimony was strange. She was so vague about everything!\nPhoenix:\nI bet von Karma probably fed her her lines.\nMaya:\nBut... But if you don\'t cross-examine her, the judge will...\nPhoenix:\nHe\'ll bang down that "flimsy gavel" of his and declare Edgeworth guilty.\nMaya:\nI guess we\'ll just have to bluff it.\nPhoenix:\nBut if we mess up... contempt of court.\nMaya:\nHey, if we lose we\'ll be held in public contempt!\nPhoenix:\nEr... right.\nLeads to:\n"I understand... I will cross-examine the witness!"Phoenix:\nI understand... I will cross-examine the witness!Karma:\nTsk tsk tsk... Very well!Judge:\nI pray for your sake this isn\'t a waste of time.Cross Examination-- Witness\'s Account --Lotta:\nIt was Christmas Eve, just after midnight, I reckon.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n"Just after midnight," you say? In other words, it was no longer Christmas Eve... but Christmas Day!\nLotta:\nHuh? Uh, yeah, well, yes.\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nI know you want to find contradictions, but really!\nPhoenix:\nMmmph.\nJudge:\nI hope your next contradiction is a little more relevant to the trial.Lotta:\nI was in my car.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy were you camping there, anyway?\nLotta:\nI\'m a research student at my university. I was taking pictures to use in my research.\nPhoenix:\n(What research? This all sounds suspicious...)\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMs. Hart. Could you be more specific about your "research"?\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nWhat does the witness\'s motive in camping by the lake have to do with this case!? The answer "is nothing"! I object to this line of questioning! Objection sustained!\nJudge:\nW-w-wait, now, I\'m the one who says that!\nKarma:\nWell, then say it already!\nJudge:\nObjection sustained.\nPhoenix:\n(Thanks for nothing, Your Honor...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nHold back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I think I\'ll let that one slide for now.)\nLeads back to cross-examinationLotta:\nI heard this "bang" come up from the lake.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, you weren\'t looking at the lake at that time?\nLotta:\nNope. I looked after I heard that noise.\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nShe\'s said that already! I asked you to find "contradictions"! Not leisurely chat with the witness!\nPhoenix:\n(Urk...)Lotta:\nWhen I looked out the window, I saw two gents in a boat.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nCould you clearly see the two men?\nLotta:\nJust look at the picture! Clear enough for you?\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh...)\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWait a second! I wasn\'t asking you about the photo! I was asking if YOU saw the two men!\nLotta:\nUh, yeah, well, of course...\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nThe witness has testified that she saw them! There\'s also a photo! You\'d best look elsewhere for your precious contradictions!\nPhoenix:\n(He jumped in quick... He\'s hiding something!)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nHold back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I think I\'d best let that one slide...)\nLeads back to cross-examinationLotta:\nThen there was another "bang"...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWere you watching the very moment the shot rang out?\nLotta:\nWell, yeah, sure...\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nYou\'re asking meaningless questions! Meaningless! "Contradictions," Mr. Wright. Not meaningless babble!\nPhoenix:\n(von Karma, I think I hate you. He\'s trying to keep me from talking to the witness... To what end...?)Lotta:\nThere wasn\'t nary a thing on the lake but that boat.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure about that?\nLotta:\nYeah, sure as a country gal can be!\nPhoenix:\n(That sounds pretty sure.)\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHow come you\'re so sure?\nLotta:\nWell, heck, I scanned the whole lake.\nPhoenix:\n("Scanned the whole lake"? It almost sounds like she was more interested in the lake than the boat...) Ms. Hart... you--\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nMr. Wright! The witness has answered the question in full.\nPhoenix:\nMmph!\nKarma:\nNo need for further questions! Objection sustained!\nJudge:\nU-uh, that\'s what I\'m...\nKarma:\nSustained!\nJudge:\nY-yes, of course.\nPhoenix:\n(Oh great... What am I supposed to do now?)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nHold back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Lotta seems pretty sure of herself. I\'d better not forge blindly ahead here. Still... this whole thing stinks.)\nLeads back to cross-examinationPhoenix:\n(Th-there weren\'t any contradictions in there!)Maya:\nSorry, Nick. If only my sister were here...Phoenix:\n(Maya\'s really taking this hard.)After selecting "Press further" upon pressing second, fourth, and sixth statements, and pressing fifth statement:Judge:\nEnough! I think we\'ve heard all we need to hear, Mr. Wright. It seems you are unable to find a contradiction in the testimony worth noting.Phoenix:\nB-but, Your Honor!Karma:\nYou keep your promise!Judge:\nMr. Wright. I am afraid that I will have to penalize any further outbursts... By holding you in contempt of court!Karma:\nAnd if that happens, you\'ll have to leave the courtroom immediately! Understood...?Phoenix:\nUh... uh huh.Maya:\nNick...! Lotta\'s testimony is fishy, Nick! Real fishy!Phoenix:\nI... know what you mean. But... If I can\'t say anything, what can I do?Judge:\nI believe we\'ve covered the evidence sufficiently to make a decision.Karma:\nThen, pass your judgment!Judge:\nVery well. Mr. Miles Edgeworth, please take the stand.???:Judge:\nWh-who was that!?Maya:\nIt... was me.Phoenix:\n(Maya!)Judge:\nI-is something wrong? D-do you need to use the facilities?Maya:\nNo, I do not! Lotta Hart! Your testimony stinks! It\'s unclear whether you were actually looking at the lake! It\'s highly doubtful that you actually say Mr. Edgeworth! Tell us the truth! This is a matter of life or death!Lotta:\n...!Maya:\nLotta! Did you really clearly see Mr. Edgeworth that night!? Did you see him fire that pistol!?Judge:\nYou will stand down! The court does not acknowledge the defense\'s outburst!Maya:\nAnswer me, Lotta!Lotta:\nWhat\'s the big idea, treating me like some kind of criminal!? I saw him! I swear it! I saw Edgeworth...Karma:Karma:\nEnough! Judge... Declare the defense in contempt of court!Judge:\nY-yes... yes, of course. I\'m sorry, but you WERE warned. Guard! Escort Mr. Wright out of the courtroom! He is in contempt of court, and must leave.Phoenix:\n(No... No...!)Wait!Maya:\nI-I was the one who made the outburst, Your Honor! Nick is innocent!Karma:\nHah! What\'s the difference? All that remains is for the guilty verdict to be declared! Isn\'t that right, Mr. Phoenix Wright!?Wrong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWrong!\nKarma:\nWhat!?\nLeads to:\n"Did you hear what Ms. Hart just said?"Right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Dammit, he\'s right...)\nMaya:\nN-Nick! There must be something we can do!\nPhoenix:\nI... don\'t think there is. The cross-examination is over already!\nMaya:\nB-but... but didn\'t Lotta just say she saw him? She did, Nick! She just said that she saw Mr. Edgeworth! She didn\'t say that in her testimony, did she?\nPhoenix:\n...! Y-you\'re right! Your Honor!\nLeads to:\n"Did you hear what Ms. Hart just said?"Phoenix:\nDid you hear what Ms. Hart just said? She said she clearly saw Mr. Edgeworth! That was not in the testimony! That changes her testimony, and I have a right to cross-examine her again!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! Order! Order! Order!Karma:\nYou\'re in contempt of court! It\'s too late for wild claims! Judge! Sustain my objection!Judge:\n... ... I\'m sorry, Mr. von Karma, but I cannot.Karma:\nWhat!?Judge:\nMs. Lotta Hart has made a new testimony. The defense does have a right to cross-examine her again.Karma:\nB-but he is in contempt of court!Maya:\nNo, I am! If you\'re going to arrest someone, arrest me!Judge:\nHmm... Very well. Maya Fey! You will leave the courtroom immediately.Maya:\nNick! I did what I could... You have to do the rest! Good luck!Phoenix:\nM-Maya...!Karma:\nPeh! I care not for this melodrama! Listen well, Mr. Wright! I do not tolerate badgering of my witnesses!Phoenix:\n(I\'m running out of time... I\'d better find a contradiction in here or else...)Judge:\nMr. Wright! Begin your cross-examination!Cross Examination-- That Last Statement --Lotta:\nI saw it clear as day. The man on the boat was Mr. Edgeworth!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, what about the other man?\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nYou cannot expect to be allowed to blithely ignore your promise, Mr. Wright! I believe you claimed there was a contradiction in the witness\'s testimony! Well, find it! If you can!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, I have to assign you a penalty.\nPhoenix:\n(Damn...!)Present Lake Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n"Got you."Phoenix:\n(That\'s it...? Uh oh. I don\'t know if I can find anything in that... What will Maya say...?)Phoenix:\nGot you. Got you, Ms. Hart! Finally!Lotta:\nWh-what!? You got what?Phoenix:\nLook at this photograph.Lotta:\nThe photo I took...?Phoenix:\nThe very same. There\'s something I want you to see in this photo... it\'s quite clearly visible. The fog, Ms. Hart.Lotta:\nSo... so?Phoenix:\nThis picture was taken with professional, high quality film, correct? Yet even it could not capture the faces of the men on the boat! Yet you claim you saw Mr. Edgeworth! How!?Lotta:\nWhut!? Wha--!Judge:\nMr. Wright has a point!Karma:Karma:\nThat\'s why I told her not to say that in her testimony! Please!Phoenix:\nYet, now she has said it, Mr. von Karma. How could you possibly see Mr. Edgeworth!? Explain yourself!Judge:\nMs. Hart.Lotta:\nWhat!Judge:\nCould you see the defendant that night?Lotta:\nO-of course! I said I could and I meant I could!Judge:\nThen, please testify as to the circumstances of your sighting.Phoenix:\n(I did it! I finally found a hole in von Karma\'s carefully vague testimony!)Witness Testimony-- How Edgeworth Was Seen --Lotta:\nYer right. It was a cold night, and the fog was thick as grits.\nSo, once I was finished setting up my camera, I got back in the car.\nStill, I brought my binoculars with me.\nWhen I heard that noise out on the lake, I looked with my binoculars.\nSee? No problem!Judge:\nHmm...You used binoculars? Very well. You may begin your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\n(This one\'d better be good!)Cross Examination-- How Edgeworth Was Seen --Lotta:\nYer right. It was a cold night, and the mist was thick as grits.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo? How could you see Edgeworth!?\nLotta:\nNow, just hold your horses for a second! You hasty Yankee types\'d never find a gal where I\'m from.\nJudge:\nDefense attorneys have trouble with that as it is.\nPhoenix:\n(Nobody loves me...)Lotta:\nSo, once I was finished setting up my camera, I got back in the car.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYour "camera"...?\nLotta:\nYeah. It\'s got an automatic...\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nThe issue we are concerned with here is Ms. Hart seeing Mr. Edgeworth! The camera has nothing to do with this at all!\nJudge:\nObjection sustained.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh! He\'s not letting her answer any of my questions!)Lotta:\nStill, I brought my binoculars with me.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n"Binoculars"?\nLotta:\nYeah, binoculars.\nPhoenix:\nYesterday, you mentioned that you were out looking for shooting stars, correct?\nLotta:\nWell... yeah.\nPhoenix:\nWouldn\'t you need a telescope, not binoculars, for that?\nLotta:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nI\'ve got doubts about your camera, too! Was that really to take pictures of meteor showers?\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nThe camera is irrelevant to this case!\nPhoenix:\nYou can\'t say that for certain!\nJudge:\nHmm... Mr. Wright. Is the camera really relevant to this case? If you believe it is, you may continue with this line of questioning.\nKarma:\nBut know this! If you find nothing with this, there will be consequences!\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Do you wish to press further about the camera?\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(This is make-it-or-break-it time!) The camera is of utmost importance, Your Honor. It is, perhaps, the key to this entire case! Therefore, I will continue my line of questioning! (Wow! Maybe I went a little overboard there...)\nJudge:\nVery well! Ms. Hart! You will testify to the court about the camera!\nLotta:\nYeah, yeah, I hear ya.\nChanges statement from "Still, I brought my binoculars with me." to "The camera was set up to take pictures of a meteor shower."\n\n\n\n\nHold back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOkay, Your Honor... I withdraw my question. (I have to remember who I\'m dealing with! I bet von Karma wants to trap me so he can put me in contempt! I think I\'ll hang back for now and see what happens.)\nKarma:\nHah!\nLeads back to cross-examinationLotta:\nThe camera was set up to take pictures of a meteor shower.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nMs. Hart. What made you choose that lake to photograph meteors? You know the fog gets thick on that lake. It\'s not very suited to stargazing.\nLotta:\nYeah, well... Y\'see, I... I guess I wasn\'t thinking too straight! Har!\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nMr. Wright! I will not have you badgering my witness because of her challenged intellect!\nLotta:\nNow wait a minute!\nKarma:\nContinue your testimony.

That\'s a lie!\nLotta:\nS-says who!?\nPhoenix:\nI saw the camera you set up yesterday. It was pointed directly at the lake!

That\'s a lie!\nLotta:\nS-says who!?\nPhoenix:\nTake a look at this photograph. This was taken on an automatic setting, was it not?\nLotta:\nY-yeah, that\'s right.\nPhoenix:\nYou have to point a camera upwards to take photos of the stars, Ms. Hart! But, as this photograph clearly shows... The camera was pointed directly at the lake!\nLeads to:\n"Ooof!"Lotta:\nWhen I heard that noise out on the lake, I looked with my binoculars.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nIf there was a heavy fog, how would binoculars change that at all?\nLotta:\nWhat do you mean?\nPhoenix:\nEven binoculars can\'t see through fog! But... you say you clearly saw him?\nLotta:\nEr... I did... yeah.\nKarma:\nEnough! There is no room for doubt in her testimony!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm. She sounded pretty doubtful to me! But... I have to find a clear contradiction first.)Phoenix:\n(I don\'t care how many von Karmic objections I get... I\'m going to find a hole in this testimony if it\'s the last thing I do!)Lotta:\nOoof!Judge:\nMr. Wright! What are you driving at?Phoenix:\nThe witness was not at the lake to photograph shooting stars, Your Honor!Lotta:\n...!Judge:\nW-well then, what exactly was she photographing?Show evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n"Your Honor! Take a look at this..."I don\'t know\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell... that I don\'t know.\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nWhat the witness takes photos of is entirely her business! This has nothing to do with the case! Not to mention that you can\'t even show us another reason why she might have been there. Mr. Wright... If you are out of material, I suggest we end this mockery of a cross-examination.\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh... I can\'t let the trial end like this! I have to show them something!)\nLeads to:\n"Your Honor! Take a look at this..."Phoenix:\nYour Honor! Take a look at this...

What do you think?\nJudge:\nI... think I\'m confused.\nKarma:\nWrong again, Mr. Wright. So very wrong. You can\'t get through this one with your weak bluffs!\nPhoenix:\nY-Your Honor! Enough playing around! Here\'s the real evidence!\nJudge:\n"Enough playing around" is my line, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nUh...\nLeads back to:\n"What was Ms. Hart trying to photograph at the lake?"Phoenix:\nMs. Hart. This is what you were trying to photograph!Judge:\nWhat\'s this? A newspaper article? "Gourdy"...? Ah, the sighting at Gourd Lake...Phoenix:\nWell, Ms. Hart?Lotta:\nI... I never heard of no lake monster! You got proof or something? Let\'s see you prove that I was down at the lake trying to photograph this "Gourdy."I don\'t have proof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, I don\'t have proof...\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nBah! Your ineptitude is entertaining, Mr. Wright, but enough is enough! I\'ve had enough of baseless claims made without a hair of evidence to support them!\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWell all right, if that\'s how you want to play... I\'ll show you evidence!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Are you sure about this?\nPhoenix:\n(I\'m sure sick of that smarmy prosecutor putting me down! Or... did he taunt me so I\'d get mad and make a mistake?)\nLeads to:\n"Very well, let\'s see it."I have proof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI have it! Proof!\nJudge:\nHmm... Intriguing!\nLeads to:\n"Very well, let\'s see it."Judge:\nVery well, let\'s see it. And... no joking around this time, please. Here is proof that the witness was trying to photograph Gourdy, the lake monster!Present Lotta\'s Camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe proof, Ms. Hart, is your own camera!\nLotta:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nYou camera was set to take photos in response to loud noises, correct? Thus this photograph here, taken when a gun fired on the lake.\nLotta:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAnd here, this article about "Gourdy." According to this article... Gourdy made a loud noise when it emerged! Well? You were trying to photograph Gourdy, weren\'t you! That\'s why you had set your camera to respond to loud noises!\nLeads to:\n"Order! Order!"Present Gourdy Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe proof is this article about Gourdy the lake monster!\nLotta:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nAccording to this article... When Gourdy breaks through the water, it makes a loud noise! Which is why you set up your camera with that microphone! You had it set to respond to loud noises! And that\'s how you got this picture when the pistol fired!\nLeads to:\n"Order! Order!"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHere\'s my proof! It\'s simple!\nJudge:\n... If it\'s simple... then why have you obviously made an error, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nUrk...?\nLotta:\nWhat\'s that!?\nKarma:\nGo home. Consider a career change.\nPhoenix:\n(Gah! How can they so casually toss aside this eviden... Oh. Whoops. Wrong evidence.)\nJudge:\nLuckily for you, I\'m in a patient mood, Mr. Wright. One more time please.\nLeads back to:\n"Here is proof that the witness was trying to photograph Gourdy, the lake monster!"Judge:\nOrder! Order! I see... I, too, thought it was a little strange.Phoenix:\n(Yeah, sure!) Well, Ms. Hart? You were camping there to try and take a photo of Gourdy, weren\'t you?Lotta:\n... Yeah. Not bad. Are all you lawyers that smart? So, smart boy, I was down there trying to photograph Gourdy, you got me. So what?Phoenix:\nHuh...?Lotta:\nThat don\'t change what I saw, does it?Karma:\nExactly! What you just used several precious minutes of our time to prove... is nothing more than that the witness is an idiot who thinks monsters exist!Lotta:\nH-hey!Karma:\nBut, as she so succinctly said, so what!? It changes nothing!Phoenix:\n(Not true! You were hiding the whole thing about Gourdy for some reason, I know it! But what could it have been...? Whatever it is, I\'m getting to the bottom of this!)Judge:\nMs. Hart. Why did you hide the fact that you were searching for Gourdy from the court? Please revise your testimony.Lotta:\n... Right. Fine, I\'ll testify. It won\'t change nothing, though.Phoenix:\n(Something will change... it has to! And I\'m going to spot it!)Karma:\n...Witness Testimony-- Lotta\'s New Testimony --Lotta:\nActually, I\'m not a research student at a university.\nI\'m an investigative photographer.\nImagine what a scoop it\'d be if I got a picture of that monster!\nThat\'s why I was camping out by the lake.\nBut, that\'s all I was hiding.\nWhen I heard the "bang" I looked right straight out at that lake.\nThere wasn\'t much else to look at, so I just watched that boat the whole time.\nThen I saw a flash, near one of the men\'s hands, and I heard another gunshot.\nI was looking right at that boat, the whole time, cross my heart and hope to fry.Judge:\nHmm... Well, Mr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.Karma:Karma:\nThe witness\'s testimony is unchanged from before! Whether she is a research student or a photographer has no bearing on this case! There is no need to waste more of our time with another pointless cross-examination!Judge:\nEr... hmm.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nI claim the defense\'s right to cross-examine the witness, Your Honor! (von Karma\'s up to something, I know it! He doesn\'t want me to cross-examine her because... why? Was there a contradiction?)Judge:\nVery well. You may begin the cross-examination. You seem sure of yourself, you must have something in mind.Karma:\nHah! That would be a first!Phoenix:\n(Hah hah, very funny.)Judge:\nYou understand that this is your last chance at a cross-examination, Mr. Wright? If there is no problem with the testimony this time, we will let the witness leave. I will announce my verdict at that time, Mr. Wright. Understood?Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.Cross Examination-- Lotta\'s New Testimony --Lotta:\nActually, I\'m not a research student at a university.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThen what manner of person are you!?\nLotta:\nI\'m not sure I\'m high-falutin\' enough to be called a "manner" of anything.Lotta:\nI\'m an investigative photographer.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAn "investigative photographer"?\nLotta:\nYep. You get your photo, and sell it to the press. It\'s that kind of business. Hey, I was taking pictures at my sister\'s graduation last year... N\' guess what!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... what?\nLotta:\nThere was a yoofoh just a\' hanging in the sky!\nPhoenix:\nA "yoofoh"...?\nLotta:\nYou know, an "Unidentified Flying Object"? A yoofoh! That\'s when I had sort of a revelation. I knew I should become an investigative photographer!\nPhoenix:\nI... I see. (Kind of a shaky basis for a career...)Lotta:\nImagine what a scoop it\'d be if I got a picture of that monster!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nIs "Gourdy" really all that newsworthy?\nLotta:\nHeck yeah! They even had him up on the TV!\nPhoenix:\n(I\'m not sure that appearing on the local news "rumor of the month" show qualifies. Last month\'s show was "Bigfoot Sighted on Acorn Hill," I believe.)\nLotta:\nHey! They also had a picture of him in the newspaper! For real!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. This is one fight I do not believe you can win. Let\'s keep moving, shall we?\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.Lotta:\nThat\'s why I was camping out by the lake.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThat\'s why you put the automatic senior on your camera?\nLotta:\nYep. Borrowed it from a friend at a university. It analyzes every sound it picks up, and when it gets a "bang!"...\nPhoenix:\nIt snaps a shot.\nLotta:\nYep.\nPhoenix:\nSo, how many pictures has it taken so far?\nLotta:\nThe only time the camera triggered was that night.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm...)Lotta:\nBut, that\'s all I was hiding.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nI think it\'s time you told us why you felt you had to hide your true purpose at the lake.\nLotta:\nHeck, if word got out what I was up to, the lake\'d be swarmin\' with competitors!\nPhoenix:\nCompetitors...?\nLotta:\nYeah! Second-rate shutterbugs trying to steal my scoop!\nPhoenix:\nAh... Is that the only reason you were hiding the truth?\nLotta:\nW-well, actually...\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nMr. Wright! I\'ll not have you asking questions with no relevance to this case!!!\nPhoenix:\n(Whatever you say, von Karma. I know you told her to keep quiet.)Lotta:\nWhen I heard the "bang" I looked right straight out at that lake.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nExactly what sort of sound was it?\nLotta:\nWell, I never heard one before so I can\'t say for sure... but it sounded like a gunshot. It was a lot sharper a sound than I would have expected.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmmm...)Present Gourdy Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n"Ms. Hart!"Lotta:\nThere wasn\'t much else to look at, so I just watched that boat the whole time.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThere wasn\'t "much else to look at"?\nLotta:\nYep.\nPhoenix:\n(I dunno. If she heard a bang... and she thought Gourdy was out there... I kind of doubt she\'d waste any time looking at a boat.)\nLotta:\nWhat? What did I do now?

Wait, so you\'re thinking maybe he was shot from some other place? I don\'t think so, nope.

It was the only thing out there! Any normal person\'d be looking at it!Phoenix:\nI agree, any normal person would. But you are far from normal!Lotta:\nWh-what!? Y\'all wanna step over here and say that!?Phoenix:\nYou were camping at the lake to take a picture of Gourdy! Think about it-- What would you do if you heard a loud noise? You\'d be scanning the lake for any sign of Gourdy, that\'s what! You wouldn\'t give the boat a second thought!Lotta:\nAah!Judge:\nOrder! Continue, Mr. Wright!Phoenix:\nYou testified that you were watching the boat through binoculars! However, you wouldn\'t need binoculars to watch that boat! You needed them to search for Gourdy... and that\'s what you were doing!Lotta:\n...! ... ...Phoenix:\nWell!?Lotta:\nHmph... Well, now that y\'all mention it... I did sort of take my binoculars and kind of scan the lake a bit... I mean, Gourdy might be out there, n\' all...Judge:\nM-Ms. Hart! A-are you saying that you were NOT watching the boat, then?Lotta:\n... S-sorry, y\'all. I wasn\'t fibbing, really. I was, just... I thought y\'know, I could be witness to a murder n\' all! I kinda got excited. I was sure I was watching that boat... till now.Judge:\n... This... this is totally uncalled for--Lotta:\nB-but hey! You got the photograph! You got proof!Judge:\nHmm...

Wait a second...)Gumshoe:\nShe even had a photograph to prove it.Phoenix:\nBut you really can\'t tell from the photo who is shooting.Gumshoe:\nThat\'s why she said she\'s going to enlarge the photo. She said "it\'ll drop the quality a mite, but should let us see who\'s who!"Phoenix:\n(She enlarged that photo! Why won\'t von Karma let her show it? I\'ve got a hunch! I bet that enlarged photo shows something bad for von Karma! This is my chance! If I\'m wrong, though, it\'ll mean prison for Edgeworth... or worse.

Is not Mr. Edgeworth!!!Judge:\nNow that everyone in the courtroom has quieted down... I would like to reconvene this court of law! Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.Judge:\nYou have given us definitive proof today. We now know that it was not Mr. Edgeworth who fired the pistol that night. However... This leaves us with a rather large problem. If Mr. Edgeworth didn\'t do it, then who shot our victim?Karma:\nPrecisely! As we have seen, there were no other people on the lake that night!

Your answer!\nLeads back to:\n"Who but the defendant could have shot the victim!?"Phoenix:\nThere is only one explanation remaining! The man who shot the victim was none other than... the victim himself!!!Judge:\nOrder! Order! So... you are saying that the victim committed suicide?Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. I can think of no other explanation.Judge:\nHmm... Indeed, that does seem to be the only remaining option.Karma:Karma:\nI\'m so very, very sorry, Mr. Wright. But suicide is out of the question.Phoenix:\nWh-what!?Karma:\nAn examination of the victim\'s wound reveals the distance at which he was shot.Phoenix:\nThe... distance?Karma:\nThe victim was clearly shot from further than a meter away!Phoenix:\nA meter! Th-that\'s three feet!Karma:\nThere is no way it could have been suicide!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Mr. von Karma! Are you sure of the accuracy of your data!?Karma:\nOf course! I had already considered the possibility of suicide, you see.Autopsy Report updated in the Court Record.Judge:\nHmm... I see. Very well, allow me to state my opinion. Considering the situation, the shooter had to be the defendant, Mr. Edgeworth. However! The prints on the gun reveal that the shooter was not Mr. Edgeworth. This is a conundrum. Therefore, I would like to suspend proceedings for this trial for the day. The court orders the defense and the prosecution to further investigate this matter.

Don\'t you have anything to say!?Edgeworth:\nNo. I have yet to be declared innocent, Wright.Phoenix:\nWell, yeah, but... What happened out there on that lake, anyway!? If he didn\'t commit suicide, then who...? The shooter was about a meter away, too!Edgeworth:\n... W-what? Don\'t give me that look! I did not kill him!Phoenix:\nI was just kidding around.Edgeworth:\nHmph.Phoenix:\nLook... I\'m going to go check on Maya.Edgeworth:\nOh... Wright.Phoenix:\nWhat?Edgeworth:\nTell her something for me.Phoenix:\nWhat?Edgeworth:\n... ... ... Tell... Tell her to watch what she says in court. That\'s all.Phoenix:\n(Would it kill you to just state how you really feel with a "thanks", Edgeworth?) (Changed from [Yeah, I\'m sure she\'ll be happy to hear you say that, Edgeworth. Jerk!] in the original release)Phoenix:\nI requisitioned a transcript of Lotta\'s entire testimony. I thought it might give me some ammunition for the trial tomorrow.

I know I\'m not the lawyer my sister was... ... I\'m sorry.Phoenix:\nWell, you did save the trial... Just, behave from now on, okay?Maya:\nO... Okay.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestioning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHave you been questioned yet?\nMaya:\nNo... not yet. Detective Gumshoe was here just now. He said "seeing as this is your first offense, we\'ll let you go after questioning."\nPhoenix:\nWhew...\nMaya:\nOh, and he wanted me to get bail money ready. You can pay for me, okay?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? How much?\nMaya:\nI don\'t know. I guess they\'ll send you a bill or something.\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I picture giant bales of money every time I hear the word "bail"?)\n\n\n\n\nMia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAny luck with Mia...?\nMaya:\nNone... I can\'t get through to her at all. I tried... I really did! I don\'t know what to do... ... I think I probably shouldn\'t have stopped my training.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... she sounds like she really did do her best. I should check and see if there are any waterfalls in the local area...)\nMaya:\nI wonder if I\'ll ever see my sister again...Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney\'s Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nIt must be nice, Nick. You can just show that to anyone and say "I\'m a lawyer!" But, spirit mediums, well...\nPhoenix:\nI dunno, with your clothes, I bet at least some people would recognize you...\nMaya:\nBut these are medium-in-training clothes... I wonder if I\'ll ever be a proper medium...\n\n\n\n\nLake Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nIsn\'t that the enlarged photo Lotta was talking about?\nPhoenix:\nUh huh.\nMaya:\nHuh... It\'s nice and big... but you can\'t really see the faces any clearer, can you?\n\n\n\n\nMisty Fey\'s Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nMy... mother. ...\nPhoenix:\n(Now that I\'ve shown her the picture, I\'m not so sure it was the right thing to do. No... I\'m pretty sure it was the wrong thing to do.)\n\n\n\n\nGourdy Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nI want to see Gourdy, too!\nPhoenix:\nIf he really exists.\nMaya:\nWell, I\'d say a photograph is pretty good proof! Once this trial is over, let\'s get some fishing poles and go down to the lake!\nPhoenix:\n(Even if there is a monster in that lake, fishing poles sound like a BAD idea...)\n\n\n\n\nPistol Bullet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nSo the markings on this bullet and the barrel of the pistol matched?\nPhoenix:\nHey, I\'m surprised you remembered that!\nMaya:\nHow could I forget after von Karma rubbed it in so much? So, which one of these are the ballistic markings?\nPhoenix:\nI\'m... not really sure.\n\n\n\n\nPistol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nMr. Edgeworth\'s prints are on this pistol, aren\'t they?\nPhoenix:\nYes... the prints from his right hand. But they must have gotten on there at some other time other than the shooting.\nMaya:\nWhat? Really!?\nPhoenix:\n(The shooter used his left hand, after all...)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nSorry... I\'m fresh out of ideas.December 26Wright & Co. Law OfficesPhoenix:\n... Sure is quiet here with nobody around. Right... I have to get Maya out of that detention cell soon!December 26Police DepartmentCriminal AffairsPhoenix:\n(Detective Gumshoe\'s not here...)Police:\nGumshoe\'s at the scene again today.Phoenix:\nHuh? Oh, really?Police:\nHe\'s a live wire that one. Got into a fight with the chief for not following protocol...Phoenix:\n(Not following protocol...? I bet he wouldn\'t help them build the case against Edgeworth...)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetective\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThat must be one of the detectives. He\'s mumbling something to himself.\nPolice:\n"Don\'t do anything rash! Why jump...? ...You have every reason to live!"\nPhoenix:\n... He must be doing image training for talking down a potential suicide.\n\n\n\n\nChief\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThis must be the chief of the detectives here. He\'s glued to his computer screen.\nChief:\nWha...!? Rook to Bishop 7... Checkmate!? I don\'t believe it!\nPhoenix:\n(He must be playing chess on the computer...)December 26Grossberg Law OfficesPhoenix:\nApparently, Mr. Grossberg is on vacation today. Well, I guess I can come back tomorrow if I need anything.Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBookshelf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nExpensive-looking mahogany bookshelves, filled with expensive-looking books. Hmm... funny... they don\'t look like they\'ve ever been read.\n\n\n\n\nDesk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA solid mahogany desk. The wood\'s been polished to a deep luster.\n\n\n\n\nVacant wall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI guess Mr. Grossberg isn\'t getting that painting back. I feel kind of bad for him...\n\n\n\n\nPotted plant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAn expensive potted plant. No idea what kind of plant it is, but it\'s probably the most expensive one available.\n\n\n\n\nTable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA table for clients. Hmm... an elegant ebony case, and if I\'m not mistaken, that lighter\'s made of solid gold. Even I can tell someone here\'s got money to burn.December 26Gourd Lake ParkEntrancePhoenix:\nThere are fewer than there were yesterday, but the cops are still around in the park. I wonder if Detective Gumshoe is here today?Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrees\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI feel winter\'s chill from the bare leaf trees today... There\'s a lot of trees here. I guess that\'s why they call it a "nature park." It\'s quite pretty when the cherry trees along the lakeside blossom in spring. Today... it\'s just cold.\n\n\n\n\nSign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe sign says "Gourd Lake Nature Park." This place is full of families picnicking on the weekend. It\'s a little cold for picnicking these days, though.December 26Gourd LakePublic BeachPhoenix:\nHaven\'t seen Larry around at all. Probably off paying through the nose on a date with the lovely Kiyance...Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe famous Gourd Lake... Its green waters stretch out on both sides... It\'s a pretty big lake, really.December 26Boat Rental ShopPhoenix:\n(Looks like the boat rental shop is closed today, too.)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA small boat rental shop. Doesn\'t look like anyone is around. They\'re probably closed because of the murder.\n\n\n\n\nBoats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere are some boats floating at the dock. The murder took place in a boat from this dock... Apparently, the police took away the actual boat that was used that night. Indeed, there\'s space for one more boat at the dock.December 26Gourd Lake WoodsPhoenix:\nHey, Detective Gumshoe!Gumshoe:\nHey, pal! The trial today, it, er... ...Phoenix:\nYes? What about the trial?Gumshoe:\nWell, I was going to say "good show," but it wasn\'t really all that... Though you did save Mr. Edgeworth, I guess... (Changed from [Though you did save Edgeworth, I guess...] in the original release) I just wasn\'t sure how to thank you... you know?Phoenix:\nEr... thanks.Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCamera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nLotta\'s camera is staring out at the lake, as usual. Even a novice like me can tell that camera must cost a pretty penny. I hope she doesn\'t leave it out here to get stolen.\n\n\n\n\nSign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe sign says "No Camping." Funny place to pick to pitch your tent.\n\n\n\n\nCampfire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI wonder why she brought a camping cooker with her? There\'s a convenience store right up the street... I guess she wanted to get into the outdoor spirit.\n\n\n\n\nSUV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI don\'t think Lotta takes very good care of her SUV. It\'s covered with dents. I can\'t believe anyone would drive their car down here.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTomorrow\'s trial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe? Any idea what strategy von Karma is planning for tomorrow?\nGumshoe:\nIt sounds like he\'s bringing in another witness!\nPhoenix:\nAnother witness!? Oh, right, he said something about that in the trial today...\n\n\nKarma:\nThere were two witnesses!\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI was wondering who that other witness was! Er... who was it?\nGumshoe:\nS... sorry, pal. As much as I\'d like to, I\'m not at liberty to divulge that information.\nPhoenix:\n(Right...)\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor Edgeworth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOh, right... I wanted to ask you something about Edgeworth.\nGumshoe:\nWhat\'s up?\nPhoenix:\nIs he afraid of earthquakes? I never heard anything about that before.\nGumshoe:\n... Mr. Edgeworth doesn\'t talk about himself too much, see. But there\'s one thing that\'s clear as day... Him hating crime the way he does... And him becoming a lawyer... And him being scared of earthquakes... It all started with that incident.\nPhoenix:\nThe DL-6 Incident?\nGumshoe:\nYep, that\'s the one. Fifteen years ago... when he saw his father shot before his very eyes! He still feels the pain now, you can see it in his eyes.\n\n\n\n\nMaya Fey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI wanted to talk to you about Maya Fey...\nGumshoe:\nHuh? She\'s not out on bail yet? That\'s strange. I told \'em to let her go as soon as they had their report written up. Man... I don\'t know what would have happened in that courtroom today if it weren\'t for her. Seeing her getting dragged out by the bailiff... I\'ll be honest with you, pal. I shed a tear or two. Mr. Edgeworth, he was so moved I saw his lip trembling. (Changed from [Edgeworth, he was so moved I saw his lip trembling.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nReally!? (Cold-as-ice Edgeworth!?)\nGumshoe:\nHe was really grateful for what she did, you know.Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney\'s Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nI think it\'s a little early for you to be proudly waving that thing around. You can be proud of yourself when you get Mr. Edgeworth declared innocent, pal!\n\n\n\n\nLotta\'s Camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThat woman really took us for a ride, didn\'t she? Claiming she was a witness to a murder and all...\nPhoenix:\nStill, if it weren\'t for her photograph, Mr. Edgeworth wouldn\'t have made it today.\nGumshoe:\nOh, huh, really?\nPhoenix:\n(Umm... you were at the trial, weren\'t you, Detective?)\n\n\n\n\nRobert\'s Autopsy Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nRobert Hammond... He was the defense attorney in the DL-6 Incident trial. He\'s the one who got the sole suspect off the hook. I wonder what Mr. Edgeworth thinks of him. Not much, I\'d wager.\n\n\n\n\nLake Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nI don\'t care who you are, no one can tell me that that\'s Mr. Edgeworth! I mean, come on, it doesn\'t look like him at all!\nPhoenix:\nBut Edgeworth has admitted he was on the boat.\nGumshoe:\nThen he\'s the one being shot, then!\nPhoenix:\nHe seemed fine in court today...\nGumshoe:\n... Details, pal, details! Whose side are you on, anyway?\nPhoenix:\n(All I\'m saying is we have to respect the evidence...)\n\n\n\n\nPistol Bullet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nYep, it was fired from the murder weapon, without a doubt.\nPhoenix:\nFrom a meter away... so it would have to have been from someone else on the boat.\nGumshoe:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you make of this, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nHey, making something of things is your job!\nPhoenix:\nEr... right. (Since when do lawyers have to do detectives\' work for them!?)\n\n\n\n\nPistol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nMaybe you should tell me why Mr. Edgeworth\'s prints were on the weapon, pal.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? How should I know!?\n\n\n\n\nLotta\'s Deposition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nNow, she heard two gunshots, right?\nPhoenix:\nBut wait... Look at the Court Record! According to this, the murder weapon was fired three times!\nGumshoe:\nWhat!? How\'s that possible!?\nPhoenix:\nWhere was the third shot fired?\nGumshoe:\nI wonder... Maybe it was a practice shot or something?\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nSorry to disappoint you, pal. I\'m drawing a blank.After clearing all Talk options:Gumshoe:\nI\'m going to head back to the station. I\'ll get the report on Maya and get her out of there as soon as I can.Phoenix:\nThank you. Oh, wait! Umm... I was wondering, how much is bail going to be?Gumshoe:\nDon\'t worry about that. Mr. Edgeworth is posting the whole amount.Phoenix:\nWhat? Edgeworth...?Gumshoe:\nDidn\'t I tell you? He\'s grateful to her for what she did. Alright, pal. Well don\'t forget to go pick her up, okay?Phoenix:\n(Hmm... Maybe I can get Edgeworth to pay this month\'s rent, too...)After clearing all Talk options in Gourd Lake Woods:December 26Detention CenterVisitor\'s RoomMaya:\nHey, Nick! You finally came! They just finished the paperwork, I\'m free to go.Phoenix:\nFree at last, eh?Maya:\nThose interrogators were really mean! They were like "okay, what did you do THIS time?" Like I was some kind of criminal! Can you believe it?Phoenix:\nWell, they let you out in the end, didn\'t they?Maya:\nMmm... Oh, that reminds me... Thanks for bail.Phoenix:\nThank Edgeworth.Maya:\nHuh?Phoenix:\nHe posted bail for you. Said he was grateful for what you did.Maya:\nMr. Edgeworth did that...? ... I have to make it up to him! We\'ve got to win this case, Nick!Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to do\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you think we should do next?\nMaya:\nWe\'re kind of lacking in the clues department. We could go to the park and look for Gourdy.\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nI-I was kidding!\nPhoenix:\nStill, if there are any clues out there, the park\'s as good a bet as any. What do you say? Shall we head down there?\nMaya:\nSure!\n\n\n\n\nAny ideas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHave you noticed anything lately?\nMaya:\nHmm... You know, I did notice one thing while I was here in detention. It\'s really pretty comfortable here. It\'s warm, and they keep it very clean.\nPhoenix:\nI meant have you noticed anything about the case...?\nMaya:\nWell... Not much more than that, no.\nPhoenix:\n(She\'s probably still upset about Mia. I should leave her alone.)Wright & Co. Law OfficesMaya:\nAhh! Fresh air! I gotta say, freedom feels great.Phoenix:\nBehave yourself in the courtroom tomorrow, okay?Maya:\nHeh heh heh. Misbehaving\'s much more fun.Phoenix:\nIt\'s not going to be so much fun when Edgeworth refuses to pay your bail again.Maya:\n... Right. I\'ll behave.Phoenix:\n(Oh dear...)Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to do\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, what should we do?\nMaya:\nI don\'t know! I\'ve been in detention this whole time. I think I\'ll let you decide what we should do. Deal?\n\n\n\n\nAny ideas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell? Any thoughts you want to share?\nMaya:\nWell, I was detention all day. I think I\'d like more time to think.\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Maya, she probably thought about Mia the whole time she was in there...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nDon\'t waste time showing me things! We have to get cracking on this case! You know the enemy has more tricks up his sleeve! He\'s bringing in another witness!December 26Detention CenterVisitor\'s RoomPhoenix:\nLooks like Edgeworth is in questioning.Maya:\nLet\'s come back later.Phoenix:\nGuess so...December 26Gourd Lake ParkEntranceMaya:\nThere aren\'t many cops around today, are there?Phoenix:\nThey\'re probably back at the precinct, working up the case against Edgeworth.Maya:\nMmm...Lotta:\nHey y\'all!Maya:\nHey, it\'s Lotta!Lotta:\nY\'all really did it today...Phoenix:\nWh-what did we do now?Lotta:\nNaw, I\'m not complaining! See, I did a little thinking. A little... self-reflection, you might say. I realized that bein\' a witness is a mighty big responsibility. But I just went up there and started blabbing any old thing that came to mind.Phoenix:\nLotta...Lotta:\nSo, you see, I want to make it up to y\'all.Phoenix:\n"Make it up"...?Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday\'s trial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat did you think of the trial?\nLotta:\nTo be honest, I was doin\' it half just to say I\'d been a witness... Even though I didn\'t really see anything. I kinda convinced myself I had though... I\'m sorry, I know I caused y\'all a lot of trouble.\nMaya:\nWell, memory is a tricky, vague little thing.\nLotta:\nYeah, I sure know that now. I\'ll be fine the next time I witness a murder!\nMaya:\nRight!\nPhoenix:\n(You mean the FIRST time you witness a murder...)\n\n\n\n\nGourdy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat about Gourdy?\nLotta:\nRight! Well, the way I figure, the trial\'s only stoking the flames of Gourdy fever! I\'ll get my exclusive photos and rocket to stardom!\nMaya:\nAll right, Lotta! You go, girl! I wish I could be an investigative photographer too!\nPhoenix:\n(Finish your spirit medium training first!)\n\n\n\n\nMaking it up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nLotta, what do you mean by "making it up to us"?\nLotta:\nWell, ya see... Actually, I got a bit of information for you.\nMaya:\nWhat!?\nLotta:\nThat von Karma didn\'t want me to say nothin\' about it.\nMaya:\nWh-what information!?\nLotta:\nNow we\'re getting to the heart of it! See, I reckoned we might be able to do ourselves a little "exchange."\nPhoenix:\nE-"exchange"? Umm... I thought this was to "make it up to us"...?\nLotta:\nRight! I propose a little exchange, to make it up to you!\nPhoenix:\n...\nLotta:\nWhat!? Information don\'t come cheap, my friend!\nMaya:\nUh...\nLotta:\nHey! I see you thinking "my, how unsophisticated these southern folks are"!!! It\'s written all over yer face! Let me tell you, most southerners are WAY more sophisticated than you... I\'m just the exception, okay? Well, what\'ll it be? We gonna deal, or not!?\nMaya:\nWh-what should we do, Nick?\n\n\n\nDeal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(We don\'t have any other leads so I don\'t think we have a choice here...) Okay. How much?\nLotta:\nHuh? You completely off your rocker? I may not be sophisticated, but I\'m not trying to rob the poor!\nLeads to:\n"Huh?"\n\n\n\n\nNo deal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI\'m sorry... But I\'ve no intention of dealing with you!\nMaya:\nNor do we have any money, anyway!\nLotta:\nYou guys make a fine team, you know that? And I can tell you don\'t have any money, just look at those clothes!\nLeads to:\n"Huh?"Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLotta\'s Camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLotta:\nI\'m thinking I should up the sensitivity of my camera mic. Y\'all just be sure y\'all don\'t sneeze or nothing when you\'re in my part of the woods!\nPhoenix:\nRight...\n\n\n\n\nLake Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLotta:\nI\'m glad I did that enlargement.\nPhoenix:\nNo kidding. If we didn\'t have that, Edgeworth would be in prison now, or worse!\nMaya:\nThere\'s never a lack of drama when you\'re on a case, is there, Nick?\nLotta:\nWhat, are you always on the verge of horrible failure like this!?\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nLotta:\nCareful or the stress\'ll send you to an early grave.\nPhoenix:\n(Thanks for the cheerful message of support!)\n\n\n\n\nGourdy Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nUmm... uh... You know, I was wondering...\nLotta:\nYeah?\nMaya:\nWhat if you get a picture of Gourdy... and it turns out like this enlargement did?\nLotta:\nY\'all crazy!? A blurry picture like this doesn\'t make a hit story! I need a picture that screams "I am Gourdy! Hear me roar!" I can\'t turn something like this into the paper! What kind of fool do y\'all think I am?\nPhoenix:\n(The kind of fool that would turn a blurry picture in as evidence in a murder trial? Not to mention claiming she saw something she didn\'t see!)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLotta:\nYep, I\'d have to say I know exactly squat about that.\nPhoenix:\n(It\'s painfully easy to know when something doesn\'t catch Lotta\'s interest...)Phoenix:\nHuh?Lotta:\nThe only fair exchange for information is... information! Listen good-- What I need from you is information about Gourdy!Maya:\nWhoa-whoa-whoa! G-Gourdy!?Phoenix:\nB-but Gourdy doesn\'t... I mean, Gourdy might not exist!Lotta:\nThen bring me proof that shows he don\'t!Phoenix:\nUh...Lotta:\nI\'ll be keepin\' watch from the car, okay? You see something, y\'all come to me first, got it?Phoenix:\nO-okay...Lotta:\nRight! See y\'all later!Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nOkay, Nick, let\'s get hunting!Phoenix:\nH-hunting...? You don\'t seriously mean...Maya:\nGourdy? I sure do!Phoenix:\nWhat about Edgeworth!?Maya:\nWe\'re searching for Gourdy for him, Nick! Don\'t you get it!?Phoenix:\n(Okay... and how exactly do we search for a make-believe monster...? Maybe we can find a monster myth specialist?)December 26Gourd LakePublic BeachPhoenix:\nWh-what\'s that?Maya:\nTh-the Steel Samurai, Nick.Butz:\nYo! Maya!Phoenix:\nLarry! What the heck is that!? (Changed from [Larry! What the heck is this!?] in the original release)Butz:\nOh, it was my girl Kiyance\'s idea... She was all "if you like, put this here, it would be, like, really cool!" Dude, she gave it to me along with the banner!Maya:\nWow! That\'s really impressive she could find those for you!Butz:\nWell, she knows a lot of people. And that show\'s finished now, so she got \'em for free.Phoenix:\nRight...Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlags\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThose flags look sadly out of place here. Flapping listlessly back and forth in a cold wind under a cold sky...\nMaya:\nI dunno, I think it kind of gives the place a festival atmosphere. It reminds me of the "War of the Eyeglasses"!\nPhoenix:\n...? The war of the what!?\nMaya:\nHuh? What? You mean, you don\'t know the War of the Eyeglasses?\nPhoenix:\nWhat the heck is it?\nMaya:\nOur local fair used to do it ever summer... Huh, I guess we were the only ones.\nPhoenix:\n(I ask again, what the heck is it!?)\n\n\n\n\nSteel Samurai inflatable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nDoesn\'t that Steel Samurai look a little out of place? I mean, it\'s so huge... I guess it\'s good advertising.\nMaya:\n... Something about this Steel Samurai just doesn\'t work for me.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Really? It looks pretty well made to me.\nMaya:\nHmph. Still a novice, aren\'t you, Nick. Really... True connoisseurs like Cody and me don\'t fall for this kind of stuff.\nPhoenix:\n(These Steel Samurai fans are obviously in a league of their own...)\n\n\n\n\nCompressor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nWhat\'s this machine?\nButz:\nThat? That\'s a compressor. I use it to fill up that balloon there with air.\nMaya:\nHuh, neat.\nButz:\nJust got it repaired yesterday! Man, what a drag that was.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nYo, Nick! What happened with Edgeworth?\nPhoenix:\nWell, we made it through the first day in court all right... I don\'t know how good our prospects are from here on, though.\nButz:\nHuh.\nMaya:\nHey, Larry, did you know Edgeworth\'s secret weakness? He\'s terrified of earthquakes! He acts like a little boy!\nButz:\nHuh? That\'s weird. I don\'t think he was ever like that in school.\nMaya:\nNo? Really?\nButz:\nWell, we were only in the same class for a year. He transferred schools pretty quickly...\nMaya:\nTransferred?\nPhoenix:\n(Right... when the DL-6 Incident happened. Doesn\'t look like Larry knows about it, though.)\n\n\n\n\nThe big samurai\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHey, Larry. What was that big... thing up there before?\nButz:\nHuh? Oh, the big guy? I\'ve had that for about a month, yeah. It\'s a big hit with the kids!\nPhoenix:\nWhy wasn\'t it there yesterday?\nButz:\nHuh? Huh!? Oh... right. Th-the compressor was busted.\nMaya:\nCompressor?\nButz:\nYeah--it\'s that little unit by my hotdog stand. That what I use to put air in the Steel Samurai! It broke a little while ago so I sent it in for repairs.\nMaya:\nOh. And here I thought you\'d inflated it by yourself.Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGourdy Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nThat\'s the guy that’s selling my dogs faster than I can cook \'em!\nMaya:\nDo you think Gourdy really exists?\nButz:\nNah, I think somebody probably saw something else that they just thought was Gourdy.

I mean, it looks so deserted.Lotta:\nJust an old guy, living all by himself. Y\'all should go check it out.Maya:\nThanks, Lotta! We will! Let\'s get cracking, Nick!Lotta:\nHold on.Phoenix:\nSomething else?Lotta:\nYeah... the night of the murder. My camera clicked twice, you know.Maya:\n...! Wait... so you have another photo?Lotta:\nWell... Yeah, but there\'s nothing in it at all. Just the lake. I figured it wouldn\'t be much use as evidence, so I kept it to myself. Well, it might not be helpful at all, but... Here, take it.Second Lake Photo added to the Court Record.Lotta:\nBye now. Y\'all take care. Time for me to pack up and leave.Maya:\n... Poor Lotta...Phoenix:\nIt\'s all Larry\'s fault. The legend still lives on, I guess.Maya:\nThe "legend"...?Phoenix:\nYeah, the legend of Larry, familiar to all who know him for any length of time... "When something smells, it\'s usually the Butz."Maya:\nHmm. Someone should whip that Butz into shape.December 26Boat Rental ShopMaya:\nHey, Nick! This is the boat shop that Lotta was talking about!Phoenix:\nYou\'re right.

How\'d you-- Hmm. That was supposed to be top secret.\nMaya:\nDo you know who that old man is, Detective?\nGumshoe:\n... Actually... I don\'t. He\'s a bit of an odd bird... I haven\'t been able to get a straight answer out of him. I decided first that he wasn\'t persuasive enough to stand and testify as a witness. That\'s why we called Ms. Lotta Hart yesterday. As for who he is... We have absolutely no idea.\nMaya:\nHmm... sounds suspicious!\nGumshoe:\nHmm...\n\n\n\n\nThe DL-6 Incident\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe, please, help us...\nGumshoe:\nH-huh?\nPhoenix:\nWe need to know about the DL-6 Incident!\nGumshoe:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nThat was when Edgeworth\'s father died. I can\'t help but think that it has something to do with this current case.\nGumshoe:\n... To tell the truth, I don\'t know much about DL-6 either. Mr. Edgeworth forbade us from reading the file. So... I\'m afraid I can\'t show them to you, either, pal.\nMaya:\nWhat!?\nGumshoe:\nHowever... If you can convince me somehow that the DL-6 Incident is related to this case... Well, I guess I\'d consider opening the file up.Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetal Detector\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThanks, Detective Gumshoe.

What if... What if that old man was connected to DL-6?\nMaya:\nN-Nick! You think he might be!?\nGumshoe:\n...After clearing all Talk options and presenting Parrot:Gumshoe:\n... I get ya. Sounds like you need information on the DL-6 Incident. Through there is the Station\'s Records Room. I\'ll give you special permission to go in and find what you need.Maya:\nAll right! Way to go, Detective Gumshoe! Okay, Nick! To the Records Room!Phoenix:\n(I guess it\'s time we faced Edgeworth\'s past...)December 26Police DepartmentRecords RoomMaya:\nWow!!! It\'s amazing.........ly dusty.Phoenix:\nTen years of files and ten years of dust, I guess.Maya:\nLet\'s find that DL-6 stuff quick!Phoenix:\n(Fifteen years ago... both me and Edgeworth were nine years old. We were almost through with fourth grade when he suddenly transferred. Because of DL-6...?)Maya:\nNick!

I\'ll go get the right file!Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlass case\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like there are files inside that glass case.

All this dust is getting to me!\n\n\n\n\nCabinet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThis cabinet is where they keep evidence for current cases. Some of the things are obviously murder weapons. Others are... who knows what. Most of it just looks like random junk.\nMaya:\nNick... what do you think this clothespin is for?\nPhoenix:\nDon\'t touch that! It\'s evidence...\n\n\n\n\nShelves\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHere are files of collected case reports. There\'s quite a large volume of reports here.\nMaya:\nWow... these are all case reports!?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. It\'s like a graveyard of police cases.\nMaya:\nI guess my sister\'s case report is in here too... quietly gathering dust.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe case summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, first I have to get a handle on the main facts... like a summary.\nMaya:\nRight. Summary... summary... Found it! Here you go.\nPhoenix:\nDecember 28... 2001.\nMaya:\nThat\'s exactly 15 years ago from the day after tomorrow!\nPhoenix:\n(So in two days, the case is closed...) The incident took place in the elevator of the district courthouse. (Changed from [The incident took place in the elevator of the district court.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nWhat!? Is this the same district courthouse where we\'re holding the trial now!? (Changed from [Is this the same district court where we\'re holding the trial now!?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nLooks like it. There was a large earthquake at 2:00 PM on that day. Part of the court building collapsed, and all of the lights went out.\nMaya:\nWow... that was some earthquake!\nPhoenix:\nAt the time, three people were trapped in the elevator. It took five hours for them to be rescued... Five hours!\nMaya:\nThat would be scary like that, in the dark!\nPhoenix:\nThere was a lack of oxygen in the elevator, and the survivors were unconscious.\nMaya:\nThe survivors...?\nPhoenix:\nOne of the three in the elevator had been shot... in the heart.\nMaya:\nThat was Mr. Edgeworth\'s father... wasn\'t it.\nPhoenix:\n(He said that his father was shot before his very eyes... So Miles Edgeworth was one of the other passengers in that elevator.)\n\n\n\n\nVictim data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nDo you have data on the victim... Edgeworth\'s father?\nMaya:\nYeah, hold on... Victim... victim... Here! Found it!\nPhoenix:\nGregory Edgeworth, 35, defense attorney. If he were still alive, he\'d be 50. He had lost that day\'s case in court, and got in the elevator with his son, Miles.\nMaya:\n"Miles"...!\nPhoenix:\nMiles Edgeworth, of course.\nMaya:\nSo he was on the elevator with his father!\nPhoenix:\nFrom the angle of the bullet and the other evidence, it could not have been a suicide... The murder weapon, a pistol, was found in the elevator. The pistol had been fired two times. (Where have I heard that before...? Huh...! It sounds just like this current case! What\'s going on here?)\n\n\n\n\nSuspect data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nGot any data on the suspect in there?\nMaya:\nHmm... that would be the guy that my mom got arrested. Hold on... this is it.\nPhoenix:\nThe man arrested as a suspect in DL-6 was... Yanni Yogi? He was a clerk in the court, apparently.\nMaya:\nSo he must have been the third person in the elevator. Well, then he had to have done it!\nPhoenix:\nBut... he was found innocent. Thanks to his defense lawyer, Robert Hammond.\nMaya:\nHammond... the victim in our case!\nPhoenix:\nRight. The suspect, Mr. Yogi was oxygen deprived... so much so he had brain damage. He lost all memory of being in the elevator. After he was declared innocent, he disappeared.\nMaya:\nHmm... where could Yogi have gone to, I wonder?\nPhoenix:\n(He may be closer than we think...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nLet\'s just hurry up and read these files! This place is so dusty, I want to finish up and get out of here...After clearing all Talk options:Phoenix:\nI guess I know generally what happened in DL-6 now. I still don\'t know what sort of impact the whole thing had on Edgeworth...Maya:\nNick. Are we going to take the whole file? There\'s too much! We\'ll never get it out.Phoenix:\nY-you\'re right. How about we just take what we think we\'ll need...DL-6 Case File added to the Court Record.Phoenix:\nRight. That\'s probably all we\'ll be able to find here. Now, all that\'s left is the trial tomorrow... I wonder how "Dad" will do testifying in court...To be continued.Nothing to examine during investigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nNo clues here.Turnabout Goodbyes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranscriptPart 1\n\nPart 2\n\nPart 3\n\nPart 4\n\nPart 5\n\nPart 6December 27, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Miles Edgeworth.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Karma:\n... ...Judge:\nVery well, apparently the prosecution is also ready.Phoenix:\n(Who is the judge here, anyway!?)Judge:\nMr. von Karma, your opening statement.Karma:\n... ...Judge:\nEr... very well, no opening statement so...Karma:Karma:\nNot so fast, Judge!

I, er, am the proprietor of the restaurant the "Wet Noodle" at Gourd Lake.Karma:\n...Uncle:\nAnd I, er, also rent boats.Karma:\nThe night of the incident, you were in the boat rental shop, correct?Uncle:\nEr... ayup, yup I was.Karma:\nPlease testify.Phoenix:\n(Wait a second... We still haven\'t heard who this old guy is!)Raise an objection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n"Wait a minute!"Let it slide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(On second thought, I guess it doesn\'t really matter.)\nMaya:\nDoesn\'t matter!? What are you thinking, Nick!? What if that old man had something to do with the DL-6 Incident? If we don\'t find out who he is, we won\'t be able to build a case here!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, she has a point.)\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n"Wait a minute!"Phoenix:\nWait a minute! The witness hasn\'t stated his name yet!Karma:Karma:\nBecause I did not ask him, Mr. Wright! Bah! I have predicted this trial will end in three minutes! Stop asking trivial questions and cooperate!Phoenix:\n(Yeah, right!)Judge:\nThe witness will state his name.Uncle:\nZzzz... ... Mmph! Well, er... I\'m not really sure, ayup.Judge:\nWhat do you mean?Uncle:\nMy, er, memory...Karma:\nYour Honor... The witness does not remember anything beyond the last several years... Ergo, he cannot recall his own name.Judge:\nHmm... he can\'t recall, you say?Karma:\nYes, but the incident in question took place three days ago. He can testify.Judge:\nVery well. Let\'s hear his testimony then, shall we. Witness?Witness Testimony-- The Night of the Murder --Uncle:\nIt was the night of the 24th, just after midnight, ayup.\nI was in the restaurant... where I er... rent boats, as usual.\nThen I heard a "bang!" Ayup.\nWhen I looked out the window, I saw a boat just a\' floating on the lake.\nThen I heard another "bang."\nJust about then the boat comes back to the shore, and a man walks by my window.Judge:\nHmm...Very well. I\'d like to begin the cross-examination...Karma:Karma:\nThere is nothing to question in my witness\'s testimony! Ergo, no need for cross-examination! Besides, there are only 10 seconds left before our three minutes are up! Judge! Your verdict, now!Judge:\nEr... yes... M-Mr. Wright...?Cross-examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat are you saying!? Of course I\'ll cross-examine the witness!\nJudge:\nHmm... Very well, you may begin.\nLeads to:\n"Raaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!"Don\'t cross-examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(He\'s right. That testimony sounded pretty solid. Maybe I should hold back.)\nMaya:\nB-but, Nick! You have to cross-examine him! This is your only chance to turn this trial around! Your last chance!\nPhoenix:\n(O-oh... right.)\nLeads to:\n"Raaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!"Karma:\nRaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!Judge:\nE-excuse me? Mr. von Karma?Karma:\nThree minutes just passed.Judge:\nI see. Well then, let\'s just take our time. You may cross-examine the witness.Cross Examination-- The Night of the Murder --Uncle:\nIt was the night of the 24th, just after midnight, ayup.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n"Just after midnight," you say?\nUncle:\nAyup, just around then.\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure?\nUncle:\nPretty sure, ayup.\nPhoenix:\nWhen I talked to you yesterday, you were rather vague about the time... I\'m surprised you seem so sure about it today.\nUncle:\n...\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nI asked him, and he remembered. Isn\'t that right!?\nUncle:\nZzzz... D-don\'t glare at me like that...! I, er... I remembered it clearly, I did. Ayup.\nKarma:\nYou see? Continue!Uncle:\nI was in the restaurant... where I er... rent boats, as usual.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nIs there anyone who can verify that?\nUncle:\n... Well, I guess Polly could.\nPhoenix:\nTh-that\'s not good enough for a court of law!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright... exactly what\'s not good enough?\nPhoenix:\nAh, uh, Your Honor, this "Polly" is a parrot.\nJudge:\nA... parrot?\nUncle:\nDon\'t be so hard on the girl, Keithy-boy!\nJudge:\nKeith...?\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nThe prosecution concedes that we cannot prove the witness was in the shop. Witness... please continue.Uncle:\nThen I heard a "bang!" Ayup.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd where did the "bang" seem to come from?\nUncle:\nFrom the lake, I figure.\nKarma:\nAre you certain?\nUncle:\nA-ayup.\nKarma:\nGood. Continue!Uncle:\nWhen I looked out the window, I saw a boat just a\' floating on the lake.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWas there someone in the boat?\nUncle:\nIt was pretty far out there... I couldn\'t see clearly... But I figure there was two men out there, ayup.\nPhoenix:\nBut you couldn\'t see them clearly!\nUncle:\nAyup... at the time, that is.\nPhoenix:\n(At the time...?)Uncle:\nThen I heard another "bang."Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you heard two gunshots total?\nUncle:\nAyup.\nPhoenix:\n(That\'s what Lotta said in her testimony yesterday.)Uncle:\nJust about then the boat comes back to the shore, and a man walks by my window.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n"By your window"?\nUncle:\nAyup, by my window. Right outside the window of my little shack.\nPhoenix:\nAnd, could you see the man\'s face?\nUncle:\nWell, the fog was pretty darn thick, but he was right there in front of me. I saw him.\nJudge:\nThis is rather important detail! Please add it to your testimony.\nUncle:\n...\nKarma:\nTsk, tsk, tsk...\nPhoenix:\n(I have a bad feeling about this...)\nAdds statement "That man was the defendant... he was saying "I can\'t believe he\'s dead."Uncle:\nThat man was the defendant... he was saying "I can\'t believe he\'s dead."Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n"A-are you sure!?"Phoenix:\n(If I know von Karma, he spent time preparing his witness. I\'m not going to find contradictions very easily in this testimony. Whew... it\'s tough being a lawyer.)Phoenix:\nA-are you sure!?Uncle:\n...Phoenix:\n(Uh oh!) D-Dad!Uncle:\nDead certain, Keith! He said "I can\'t believe he\'s dead" as he was walking by, too.Karma:\nWitness! Are you sure that the person you saw was Miles Edgeworth!?Uncle:\nIt was him! That Edgeworth boy!Judge:\n... This... sounds like decisive evidence indeed. I see no room for doubt.Phoenix:\n(von Karma... He lured me into cross-examining so he could set me up for a fall!)Karma:\nTsk, tsk, tsk...Maya:\nN-Nick...! I don\'t like the way things are going here! Everyone in the courtroom is glaring at us!Phoenix:\n(I\'d better act quick, or this trial is going to be over!)Raise an objection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! We proved in yesterday\'s court that it could not have been Edgeworth who fired the gun!\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nMr. Wright. Are you referring to the fingerprints from Edgeworth\'s right hand found on the gun, and the photograph showing a man firing with his left hand...?\nPhoenix:\nExactly!\nKarma:\nThat is easily explainable! He could have wiped his prints after he fired! You are ignoring the truth of the matter here! Everything in this witness\'s testimony is true!\nLeads to:\n"Hmm..."Wait and see what happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(But... how can I raise an objection without any proof?)\nKarma:\nJudge! There is no room for doubt in the witness\'s testimony! I demand that you declare your verdict!\nLeads to:\n"Hmm..."Judge:\nHmm...Phoenix:\n(The judge is lost in thought... what should I do?)Raise an objection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! This witness claims that Edgeworth said "I can\' t believe he\'s dead"... But his word is all we have! If he were telling a lie...\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nMr. Wright. In a court of law, the evidence tells all. Apparently, you have yet to realize even this basic fact. If you say his testimony is a lie, show us proof!\nPhoenix:\nUrk...\nMaya:\nNick! Do we have evidence...?\nLeads to:\n"It\'s no good! There\'s nothing I can do."Wait and see what happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I can\'t see any room to raise an objection... I\'d better hold back and see how things develop.)\nMaya:\nNick! We have to do something! If we stay quiet now, Mr. Edgeworth\'ll be found guilty for sure!\nLeads to:\n"It\'s no good! There\'s nothing I can do."Phoenix:\nIt\'s no good! There\'s nothing I can do.Maya:\nA... are you sure?Phoenix:\nTo be honest... I don\'t know what to do anymore.Maya:\nPlease... Can you hear me, Sis? Please... We need your help... Nick needs you...Karma:\nTsk tsk tsk... Three minutes was perhaps too high an expectation. However, fifteen minutes isn\'t bad! This must be a new record.Judge:\nEnough! The witness may leave the stand.Uncle:\nZzzz...Judge:\nThis court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts.Phoenix:\n(W-what!? No!)Karma:\nHmph.Judge:\nThis court find the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth...GuiltyJudge:\nThe accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today\'s date. That is all. The court is adjourned!W-w-waaaaaaait!Judge:\nWh-who was that just now?Me!!!Phoenix:\nHuh? Waaaaah! L-Larry!Judge:\nWh-what are you doing here!?Butz:\nListen! Y-you gotta listen to me! I... I was...  I was there, in the park, the night of the murder! I... I wasn\'t sure about it until just yesterday. B-but today I remembered it!Judge:\nRemembered what?Butz:\nThe gunshot! I heard it too!Judge:\nO-order!Karma:Karma:\nWhat is the meaning of this!? The verdict has been decided! I call for adjournment!Judge:\nOne moment, Mr. von Karma. So, you say you heard a gunshot?Butz:\nYeah, I did! A gunshot! That night! I was sitting here in the audience, listening to the testimony... Then I realized, something he said was different from what I remember! A-anyhow, I can\'t just sit here and let you call Edgey a murderer! It\'s... It\'s just not right! I\'ll testify! Lemme testify!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Well, this is the first time something has happened like this in my court. I\'m not quite sure how to proceed...Karma:\nJudge! You\'ve already given your decision! The trial is over!Maya:\nNick! This is it! Larry\'s given us one final chance at this!Phoenix:\n(She\'s right! If only it wasn\'t Larry... He could make things even worse...)Maya:\nMr. Edgeworth was just declared guilty, Nick! It doesn\'t get any worse!Phoenix:\nYou\'re right! Okay! Your Honor! If there is another witness, it is our duty to hear him speak! Right here! Right now!Karma:\nA waste of time! The verdict cannot be overturned!Judge:\nHmm... ... ... Allow me to speak my opinion. In all court proceedings, it is our duty to prevent an inaccurate verdict. In order to make sure no mistake has been made, every witness should be heard!Karma:\nWh-what is this!?Judge:\nI withdraw my previous verdict of "guilty"! Mr. von Karma! I order you to call this new witness to testify. Now!Karma:\nWhaaaat!Judge:\nThe court will adjourn for a five minute recess. After that, we will hear this new witness. Court is adjourned!December 27, 10:28 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2Phoenix:\nWhew... That was too close. Sorry to keep you on the edge of your seat like that, Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\nHmph. I\'ve seen worse.Phoenix:\n(Yeah right, Edgeworth. You\'re sweating bullets!) I just wonder what Larry plans to say in there.Maya:\nLarry was at the lake that night?Phoenix:\nYes... He said he went looking for the Steel Samurai balloon that flew into the lake.Maya:\nOh right. And he found the balloon and the air tank that night?Phoenix:\nYeah.Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\nHey, Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\n... Huh? You say something, Wright?Phoenix:\nYeah, a lot of things. You seem out of it. What\'s wrong?Edgeworth:\nIt... it\'s nothing.Phoenix:\nHmm?Maya:\nUmm... Mr. Edgeworth? There\'s something I\'ve been meaning to ask you.Edgeworth:\nWhat\'s that?Maya:\nWhy are your fingerprints on the murder weapon?Edgeworth:\nOh. When he fell into the lake, I went into a daze. I couldn\'t understand what had happened. I couldn\'t think straight. Then I saw the pistol lying on the floor of the boat in front of me. I picked it up without thinking. I didn\'t have a reason, really.Maya:\nI see...Edgeworth:\nWright...Phoenix:\nYeah?Edgeworth:\nThis might be our chance.Phoenix:\nOur chance?Edgeworth:\nvon Karma has only ever run perfect trials.Phoenix:\nPerfect trials...?Edgeworth:\nPerfectly prepared witnesses, perfectly complete evidence. That\'s the secret to his success. This is the first time he\'s ever had to deal with something unexpected! He has to let someone he hasn\'t even talked to testify before the court! (Changed from [He has let someone he hasn\'t even talked to testify before the court!] in the original release) And that someone... is Larry!Phoenix:\nWhat are you getting at?Edgeworth:\nIt\'s likely his testimony will be full of holes, Wright.Maya:\nThat\'s right, Nick! No ten minute trial this time! We\'ll milk this one for all it\'s worth!Phoenix:\nHey, it was fifteen minutes! Fifteen! (Everything\'s on Larry now...) (Changed from [Hey, it was fifteen minutes! Fifteen! (Everything depends on Larry now...)] in the original release)December 27, 10:35 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:\nCourt is now back in session. Witness... Please testify to the court about everything that you saw... on the night of December 24th.Butz:\nRight... leave it to me!Phoenix:\n(Please, Larry, don\'t mess this one up!!! I hate to admit it, but you\'re our last chance!)Karma:\n...Phoenix:\n(von Karma didn\'t even have time to prep his witness. I just hope Edgeworth is right about this being our big break...)Witness Testimony-- The Night of the Murder --Butz:\nThat night, I was out in a boat on the lake.\nI was looking for something and I, er, found it.\nSo I quietly slipped the boat back in at the rental shop dock.\nThen, just as I was thinking about going home, I heard this "bang"!\nI looked out over the lake, but I didn\'t notice the boat.\nSo after I heard that single gunshot I went home.Judge:\nHmm... That was an unusually vague testimony, even for this court. In any matter, Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor...Maya:\nWhat\'s wrong, Nick?Phoenix:\nIt\'s Larry! I have no idea what he\'s going to say if I press him. I\'m a little scared.Maya:\nHmm... Well, we\'ve come this far. There\'s no way to go but forward, Nick!Cross Examination'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o'}}

You can't imagine how much I've suffered...You... suffered?And now... the perfect opportunity presents itself. At last... I shall have my revenge!What!?...Merry Christmas.December 25, 10:08 AMWright & Co. Law OfficesMaya:
Hey, hey, Nick! Do you know if there's any good waterfalls around here?Phoenix:
Waterfalls...? Dare I ask why?Maya:
Duh, Nick! Isn't it obvious? I need a waterfall to stand under! Preferably a freezing one!Phoenix:
... Oh... Is that part of your spirit medium training?Maya:
Of course! Except, I've been slacking off lately... I need to brave the elements and be forged anew under the rushing spring waters!Phoenix:
Umm... Okay... I don't know about any falls per se, but Gourd Lake is pretty close...Maya:
Oh. Darn.Phoenix:
Sorry, but them's the breaks. Couldn't you just take a cold shower or something?Maya:
... Good idea!Phoenix:
(So much for the rushing spring waters...)TV:
Next in the news... A large, unidentified animal was sighted at Gourd Lake! The town is buzzing with excitement! Locals are calling it "Gourdy" in a tip of the hat to Nessie, the Loch Ness monster. Though its namesake, Nessie, proved to be a hoax... locals are confident their Gourdy is the real deal. ...Phoenix:
*yawn* Bor-ing. Can't they show real news for a change?Maya:
Nick?Phoenix:
?Maya:
The water pressure's kind of low in that shower.Phoenix:
... You want more pressure, huh? Why don't you go down to the fire department and have them spray you with the hose?Maya:
... Good idea, Nick!Phoenix:
(Apparently, Fey blood is no aid in detecting sarcasm...) (Changed from [Apparently, E.S.P. is no aid in detecting sarcasm...] in the original release)TV:
We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin! Strange occurrences continue at Gourd Lake... But this time, it's murder!Phoenix:
(Gourd Lake again?)TV:
The body of a man was found in the lake early this morning. A suspect was apprehended. Sources inside the police department revealed... that the suspect's name is Miles Edgeworth, age 24. Edgeworth was an up-and-coming prosecution attorney, known for his skill and connections. He was guaranteed a long and rewarding career... Has he thrown it all away?Phoenix:
(...? E-Edgeworth!?) What's going on!? Edgeworth would never do something like--Maya:
Nick?Phoenix:
Yipes! M-Maya!Maya:
The fireman yelled at me when I called him.Phoenix:
We've got bigger things to worry about than that! They arrested Edgeworth!Maya:
What? You mean, the prosecutor?Phoenix:
Yeah, he's a suspect... in a murder!Maya:
Whaaaaat!? When? Where? Whom? Why? How?Phoenix:
I-I don't know!Maya:
Let's go find out, Nick!Examine









Bookshelf







Phoenix:
Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. I tried reading one, and it made my head hurt. When I closed it, it slipped out of my hand. Then my foot hurt too.




Charley the plant







Phoenix:
Mia's favorite plant. Its name is "Charley." Maya's gotten the knack of watering it lately. Charley's been perking up these days.




Desk







Phoenix:
Mia's desk. If we had more clients, I would probably sit here more often. Lately, I've been spending more time on the couch, watching TV.




Movie poster







Phoenix:
Maya brought in a poster of the Steel Samurai the other day. We had a big fight over whether to put it up or not. I know she's just waiting for a chance to sneak it up on the wall.




Window







Phoenix:
Looks like it's cleaning day again at the hotel across the way. I hear they're planning a second branch outside the city. I can see the bellboy, getting the angle of that screwdriver in the drawer just right.Talk









What to do







Phoenix:
Well, what should we do?
Maya:
What do you mean!? Let's investigate! We should talk to Mr. Edgeworth, and check out the crime scene!
Phoenix:
(You're right... We need more information! Save aimlessness and confusion for later!)




Any ideas







Phoenix:
Well? Got any good ideas?
Maya:
Not really. I do my best thinking when I'm standing underneath a waterfall.Present









Attorney's Badge







Phoenix:
You know, I think it's developing a nice luster.
Maya:
I'll look at your badge later, Nick. We've got work to do!
Phoenix:
(I suppose you're right...)December 25Detention CenterVisitor's RoomMaya:
You know, Nick... We've all been in here one time or another, haven't we?Phoenix:
I guess it comes with the territory.Maya:
I'm not sure it's something we should mention to too many people... Aah!Phoenix:
... Hey! Edgeworth! Come back!Edgeworth:
What are you doing here!?Maya:
Nick, I don't think he's in a very good mood.Phoenix:
Well, he is in detention. Were you in a good mood when you were here?Edgeworth:
So, you've come to laugh at the fallen attorney? Then laugh, laugh! Well? Why aren't you laughing?Maya:
Nick... Should we be laughing?Phoenix:
Nah. It's a trick. Laugh and he'll get mad... or burst into tears. Edgeworth. We don't have so much free time we can spend it coming down here to laugh at you.Edgeworth:
... Yes you do.Phoenix:
(Actually, he's right.)Edgeworth:
... I hoped you wouldn't come. I didn't want you to see me. Not like this.Phoenix:
(I didn't want to see you like this, either. Believe me.) (Changed from [Hey, I didn't want to see you either, believe me.] in the original release)Examine









Surveillance camera







Phoenix:
Smile for the camera...




Security guard







Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch since I came in. A real pro. Or maybe he's just nervous with Edgeworth in the room.Talk









What happened







Phoenix:
Edgeworth. Tell me what happened.
Edgeworth:
... Why should I? What are you going to do about it?
Maya:
Duh! We're going to help you, that's what!
Edgeworth:
...! ... Help me? You? Don't be ridiculous.
Phoenix:
Sorry...?
Edgeworth:
You're a novice! You've only been in three trials!
Phoenix:
H-hey!
Edgeworth:
Sure, you got lucky and won all three... But your luck's bound to run out some day! You need real skill, Wright. Experience!
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
Nick! He's insulting you! Nick? Why am I always the one who has to get angry!?




Gourd Lake







Phoenix:
The murder took place at Gourd Lake, correct?
Edgeworth:
Yes... late last night.
Phoenix:
The lake is a long way away from your offices and the court... Why were you down there?
Edgeworth:
... I see no need to tell you.
Maya:
M-Mr. Edgeworth! You... you didn't really...?
Edgeworth:
... Gourdy.
Maya:
Huh?
Edgeworth:
I went to see Gourdy.
Maya:
"Gourdy"? What's that!?
Phoenix:
I'll... tell you later. (Why won't Edgeworth talk to us?)




Did you do it (appears after "What happened", "Gourd Lake", and presenting Attorney's Badge)







Phoenix:
Edgeworth... this is really hard for me to ask... But... you didn't do it, right? Right?
Edgeworth:
... Think what you will. I have only one request.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Edgeworth:
Stay out of this case.
Maya:
Why!? B-but Nick is trying to help you!
Edgeworth:
I know...! I know that! But I don't want your help, okay?
Maya:



Why not?
Edgeworth:
... Look, just go away, and leave me alone!
Maya:
Nick... Mr. Edgeworth did it, didn't he.
Phoenix:
Maya! Let's go investigate elsewhere.
Maya:
But, Nick...Present









Attorney's Badge







Edgeworth:
Your attorney's badge...?
Phoenix:
Edgeworth. Let me defend you.
Edgeworth:
... Hah! Hah hah! Good one, Wright. But I'm not that hard up. Not yet.
Maya:
Wh-what do you mean by that?
Edgeworth:
Me? Trust a wet-behind-the-ears lawyer with only three trials under his belt? Never!
Maya:
Wh-what!?
Edgeworth:
My case is near hopeless, Wright. Every defense attorney I've talked to has turned me down.
Phoenix:
What?
Edgeworth:
Simply put, they were afraid they'd lose. It occurred to me that it might be my fault that they lack confidence. After all, I did get every single one of their clients declared "guilty."
Phoenix:
I don't believe it!
Edgeworth:
Regardless, I don't want you involved in this. You in particular I cannot ask to do this.December 25Gourd Lake ParkEntranceMaya:
This is where it happened?Phoenix:
Yeah. Gourd Lake is in the middle of this park.Maya:
I can see some police walking around in there.Phoenix:
Questioning people, probably.Maya:
Hey! Isn't that Detective Gumshoe over there?Gumshoe:
Well, pal!? There's enough of us here! Anyone found anything?Police:
S-sorry, sir... Nothing.Gumshoe:
Idiot! The trial's tomorrow! We need clues, on the double!Police:
B-but, sir... There weren't any clues... that's why we arrested that attorney, Mr. Edgeworth! It's clear, sir. He's the one who--Gumshoe:
Shaddup! Just you try saying that again! I'll... I'll... I'll make you sorry if you do! (Changed from [I'll... er... I'll make you sorry if you do!] in the original release) So just... just, get outta my face, pal! (Changed from [I mean... just, get outta my face, pal!] in the original release)Police:
Y-yes, sir!Maya:
Detective Gumshoe's kinda scary today!Gumshoe:
Recruits... peh! ... Aah!Maya:
Eek!Gumshoe:
Hey, you're that Harry guy! Harry Butz!Phoenix:
Wright! Phoenix Wright! (Will he ever learn my name!?)Gumshoe:
And just what are you doing here, pal? Investigating!?Phoenix:
Huh? Um, well, yes. I suppose.Gumshoe:
Well, I'm here to help! Ask me anything you want! Bring it!Maya:
He seems different than usual. I wonder what's up? Umm... Mr. Edgeworth hasn't actually asked us to defend him yet...Gumshoe:
Huh!? Oh? Y-you don't say...Examine









Trees







Phoenix:
I feel winter's chill from the bare leaf trees today... *sigh* What is it about winter that turns people into poets?
Maya:
I don't know, but my toes are starting to feel numb.
Phoenix:
(Yes... my poetry has that effect on some people.)




Sign







Phoenix:
The sign says "Gourd Lake Nature Park." This place is full of families picnicking on the weekend.
Maya:
But... no waterfall.
Phoenix:
Not many picnickers come here for spiritual training, Maya.Talk









What happened







Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe? Do you know what happened here?
Gumshoe:
Huh? You don't know, pal?
Phoenix:
No...
Gumshoe:
Wow, okay, Mr. Head-in-the-fluffy-pink-clouds Lawyer.
Phoenix:
Head-in-the... huh?
Gumshoe:
Never mind, I'll tell you. It happened last night, about 15 minutes after midnight. There was a boat out on Gourd Lake. In that boat were two men. One of those men shot the other with a pistol.
Maya:
And... the shooter was Mr. Edgeworth?
Gumshoe:
A cop who arrived on the scene arrested him.
Maya:
How did they get there so fast? (Changed from [How did he get there so fast?] in the original release)
Gumshoe:
Well... There was a witness. When the report came in, we raced to the lake.
Phoenix:
A witness?




Edgeworth







Maya:
You don't think Mr. Edgeworth is a... murderer, do you!? (Changed from [You don't think Mr. Edgeworth is a... murderer!?] in the original release)
Gumshoe:
Absolutely not! It's impossible! I don't care if there's a witness either! I don't believe a lick of it!
Maya:
R-right! Who cares what the witness says!
Phoenix:
(I care!)
Maya:
... You really believe in him, don't you, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Course I do! But... the police are pretty sure he's the killer. Nobody's even really taking this investigation that seriously.
Maya:
Oh no!
Gumshoe:
After all the help Mr. Edgeworth has been to us... Hard to imagine that no one's standing up to take his side.
Maya:
Well, at least you are, Detective. At least you are.




Defense request







Maya:
Do you know who will be Mr. Edgeworth's defense attorney in tomorrow's trial?
Gumshoe:
He hasn't got one yet.
Maya:
What? The trial IS tomorrow, isn't it?
Gumshoe:
Well, I don't know the whole story... But apparently no one he's been talking to will take his case.
Maya:
W-why not?
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth won't tell me! When you guys showed up, I figured he'd asked you to defend him.
Phoenix:
U-unfortunately not...
Gumshoe:
Well, pal, then you got a job to do! Help out Mr. Edgeworth! Prove that badge you wear isn't just some fancy piece of metal! Prove it to me, pal! Show me you're an attorney!




Defense request (after presenting Attorney's Badge in Detention Center - Visitor's Room)







Maya:
I-is it true? No one will take Mr. Edgeworth's case?
Gumshoe:
Yeah... He's a bit of a celebrity. If you defended him, and lost, your reputation'd be sure to suffer. What's more... The case against him is... well, it's pretty solid.
Phoenix:
(I suppose it would be if they have a witness.)
Gumshoe:
Hey! Pal! Don't tell me your going to turn your back on him too!? Remember the Steel Samurai case? (Changed from [Remember the Steel Samurai!] in the original release) Mr. Edgeworth helped you get your client declared innocent!
Phoenix:
I... I know. I went to Edgeworth. I tried. He really doesn't want us to represent him. Especially not us, he said.
Gumshoe:
What!? W-well, that doesn't make any sense, pal! You should have heard him talking about you after that trial! (Changed from [You should have heard him talking about you after the Steel Samurai case!] in the original release) He kept saying "Wright, Wright, Wright," over and over.
Maya:
... Nick? I'm not sure that's a good sign.
Phoenix:
Neither am I...
Gumshoe:
Why wouldn't he want your help? I don't get it.




The witness (appears after "What happened")







Phoenix:
Who was this witness?
Gumshoe:
Er, sorry, pal. That's confidential. Anyway, the witness saw everything, apparently. I'm sure they'll turn up at the trial tomorrow.
Phoenix:
Was there only that one witness?
Gumshoe:
Yep. It was pretty cold out on the lake last night. And, it was Christmas Eve after all. Still, we're being thorough. You never know when you're going to turn up another witness. That's why we're here today, checking things out. So far, we're coming up empty...
Maya:
Oh! It's Christmas today! I'd forgotten. What are you getting me for Christmas, Nick?
Phoenix:
Talk to Santa.Present









Attorney's Badge







Gumshoe:
That badge! You're showing that to the wrong guy, pal! You gotta show that to someone who needs it!After clearing all Talk options:Police:
Detective Gumshoe, sir!Gumshoe:
What? Find something!?Police:
Um, no, sir. Not yet. But there was a call from the precinct. They want to hold an investigation briefing...Gumshoe:
A briefing? Right! I'm off! Oh... Sorry, pal. I guess you heard. I gotta go. Any last things you want to ask me about before I head back?The autopsy report







Maya:
Well, yes. Do you have any information on the victim...?
Gumshoe:
Sorry... They haven't worked up the autopsy report yet. I'm still waiting for it myself. Actually... Say, if you get the time, drop by the precinct! We can talk more there, pal!

You're not coming back, Detective?Gumshoe:
Erm... Probably not, pal.Phoenix:
So, what should we do if we have something to talk to you about...?Gumshoe:
Ah, right. Here, I'll show you how to get to the precinct. Come down and see me anytime.Detective Gumshoe gave you directions to the police station.Phoenix:
Oh, hey! Detective Gumshoe!Gumshoe:
W-what!?Phoenix:
Um, we'd like to take a look around in the park. Can we walk around?Gumshoe:
Yeah! No problem, pal. You got my permission.Maya:
You know, Nick. I think there's something to be said for talking to people when they're busy.Phoenix:
Yeah. They don't have time to think about not giving you information...Maya:
Right! Now, let's get investigating!December 25Police DepartmentCriminal AffairsMaya:

Something wrong, miss? Hmm? Turning yourself in? Okay, what did you do? Shoplifting? Larceny? Public indecency...?Maya:
N-no! None of those things! We're looking for Detective Gumshoe... is he around?Chief:
Gumshoe? Oh yeah. He's in a meeting right now. I don't think he'll be out any time soon.Maya:
Okay, we'll come back.Chief:
You do that. Oh, and go straight home and stay out of trouble. No more shoplifting, you got that?Maya:
... Do I look like a criminal or something?Examine









Poster







Phoenix:
A poster of a female police officer... Wait, no. That's the latest "Babes in Uniform" calendar. My bad.




Detective







Phoenix:
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
Police:
"...your mama could see you know she'd be crying'... ...a break and spit it out, you lowlife scumbag..."
Phoenix:
... He must be doing image training for interrogations.




Desk







Phoenix:
These are the detectives' desks. There are computers and files on each one. Funny, they're a lot tidier than I'd expect. I guess the detectives don't spend a lot of time at their desks.




Blue Badger







Phoenix:
Hey, is that the police department's mascot...?
Chief:
That's the "Blue Badger"! It was my idea! I made it! It's my mascot!
Phoenix:
I... see. How nice.
Chief:
I'll get him assigned mascot of the Criminal Affairs Dept. if it's the last thing I do!
Phoenix:
Um, good luck!




Chief







Phoenix:
This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen.
Chief:
Wha...!? "Gourd Lake...!" "Gourdy sighted"!!! I don't believe it!
Phoenix:
(Shouldn't you be reading something more important...?)December 25Gourd LakePublic BeachMaya:
Wowsers! This is "Gourd Lake"?Phoenix:
Yup. I'm not sure it warrants a "wowsers," though.Maya:
Hmm. Probably not. But hey, look at that snack stand!Phoenix:
"Samurai Dogs"...?Maya:
I wanna Samurai Dog! Please! I bet they're great!Phoenix:
With a name like Samurai Dog, how could they not be?Maya:
They're a little behind the times, though. The kids are all into "The Pink Princess" now. I mean, like, y'know!?Phoenix:
(Nope.)Examine









Lake







Maya:
Wow. Gourd Lake is really big.
Phoenix:
Yeah.
Maya:
Say, Nick. Why is it called "Gourd Lake"?
Phoenix:
Oh. Well, a long time ago, they used to grow gourds here.
Maya:
Whoa! No way! I was sure it was because the lake looked like a gourd when viewed from above! You know, like an hourglass shape?
Phoenix:
Well, it is shaped like a gourd, actually. But that's just a coincidence.
Maya:
Oh. Okay.




Trash can







Phoenix:
The trashcan is empty. At least the place is well maintained.




Bench







Phoenix:
A lineup of plastic benches. I guess the idea is you buy a dog and eat it here. I doubt anyone would sit here and eat on a day like this. Except maybe Maya... if she had a Samurai Dog.




Sign







Phoenix:
Huh... I almost didn't see that signpost. "Left - Boat docks" "Right - Exit"




Vendor stand







Phoenix:
A hotdog stand. It's closed... The Christmas fringe looks a little half-baked. The banner reads "Samurai Dogs"... Somebody needs to redecorate.




Popper







Maya:
Huh. Someone left some poppers here. You know, you pull the string... (Changed from [Huh. Someone left one of those poppers here. You know, you pull the string...] in the original release)
Phoenix:
...And it goes "pop." Yeah, I know the ones. You see them a lot around New Year's.
Maya:
Hey, Nick! They might be a clue! (Changed from [Hey, Nick! It might be a clue!] in the original release) Let's take them. (Changed from [Let's take it.] in the original release)
Phoenix:
C'mon, admit it. You just want to pop them, right? (Changed from [C'mon, admit it. You just want to pop it, right?] in the original release)

Take them (Changed from [Take it] in the original release)







Phoenix:

Anything else







Edgeworth:
What's that? I'm not in the mood for idle banter, Wright.December 25Boat Rental ShopMaya:
Nick... what is this place?Phoenix:
A boat rental shop. Closed for Christmas it seems. I guess a murder taking place on one of the boats won't be good for business, either.Maya:
Boats... I've never ridden on a boat.Phoenix:
Really? Well, how about we go out on one when the trial is finished?Maya:
Hey, good idea! You bet!Examine









Trees







Phoenix:
There's more forest off that way. I doubt I'd find any helpful clues in there.




Shop







Phoenix:
A small boat rental shop. Doesn't look like anyone is around. They're probably closed because it's Christmas.




Boats







Phoenix:
There are some boats floating at the dock. Was one of these boats used in the murder, I wonder?
Maya:
Nick?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Maya:
I changed my mind. I don't really want to go for a boat ride.December 25Gourd Lake WoodsMaya:
I like it here, Nick. Look... someone's camping!Phoenix:
They've got guts, camping at the scene of a murder.Maya:
Hey, hey, Nick! If they were camping here last night, they might know about the murder!Phoenix:
(That's true...) Good call, Maya. Let's go talk to them.Examine









Camera







Maya:
Hey, Nick. Check out this camera!
Phoenix:
Yeah... what's with the big mic and that box on top, I wonder? It looks like some sort of automatic system for taking a photo when a noise is heard.
Maya:
Wow! Hey, let's see if it works! *cough* "Hi, I'm Nick!" ... Maybe I'm not saying it loud enough. "YO! I'M NICK!!!" ... Huh. NIIIIIIIIII......IIIIIIIIIICK!

The trees grow quite thick here. Further back, the trees fade into the shadow where the sunlight can't reach them.




Sign







Phoenix:
The sign says "No Camping." Funny place to pick to pitch your tent.
Maya:
Wait, what if the sign said "No Setting Tents on Fire"?
Phoenix:
... I don't think they have signs like that.
Maya:
Oh...




Sheet







Phoenix:
There's food and some magazines on the sheet. It takes a pretty tough skin to camp in this cold.




Campfire







Maya:
Hey, Nick!
Phoenix:
What, don't tell me you're hungry again?
Maya:
No, no. I was just wondering, why are camping pots and pans made of aluminum?
Phoenix:
... They didn't talk about that in any of the law books.
Maya:
So, there's no law saying they have to be made out of aluminum, then!
Phoenix:
(I'm not having this conversation...)




SUV







Phoenix:
This SUV has seen better days. It's dented all over. I can't believe anyone would drive their car down here.Phoenix:

What happened







Lotta:
Oh yeah, when was that murder, anyway? I ain't seen much television lately.
Phoenix:
It happened late in the night on Christmas Eve.
Lotta:
That so? Christmas Eve?
Phoenix:
A man on a boat was shot... Did you see anything?
Lotta:
Well, lemme see. A boat, ya say? I reckon I mighta seen one... not sure though. Y'all gotta remember I've been watching this here lake for a good three days now. I seen enough boats to choke a mule. Kinda hard to remember which I seen when.

The victim







Phoenix:
Do you know anything about the victim yet?
Gumshoe:
No, no... Still can't I.D. him.
Maya:
Has Mr. Edgeworth said anything?
Gumshoe:
Not a word.




The meeting







Phoenix:
So, how did the meeting go?
Gumshoe:
I can't tell you, pal! You're a lawyer!
Phoenix:
T-true...
Gumshoe:
... Y'know... I don't know what to believe anymore. Sure, Mr. Edgeworth's human like you or me. Still... I get the feeling that if he'd done something wrong, he wouldn't go hiding it. That's just the kind of guy he is. Why can't anyone else see that?
Maya:
So, they think that Mr. Edgeworth did it...?
Gumshoe:
Well, the trial's starting tomorrow, as scheduled.
Maya:
I see...
Gumshoe:
...
Phoenix:
Umm... hey, in the end you did tell us about the meeting!
Gumshoe:
... Don't go telling anyone else, pal.
Phoenix:
Y-yes, sir!
Gumshoe:
And... do me a favor! Stand by Mr. Edgeworth! He needs help, and you're the ones to help him! I'm sure he's got some reason why he won't talk to us.
Maya:
Thanks, Detective Gumshoe.




Trusting Edgeworth (appears after "The meeting")







Maya:
Detective Gumshoe... How come you trust Mr. Edgeworth so much?
Gumshoe:
Well, I'd think that was obvious. We got a strong working relationship, us two. We trust each other, and that's how it works.
Maya:
A "working relationship"?
Gumshoe:
See, Mr. Edgeworth always gets his defendants declared "guilty" every time. Yeah, his methods might be a little extreme at times. But... there's a reason! He trusts our investigation, see? He trusts us to get the right man! That's why I work extra hard, pal. We've got to earn that trust he places in us.
Maya:
I see...
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth is a man you can trust... And you have my word on that!




The autopsy report (appears after "Trusting Edgeworth")

What to do







Phoenix:
Well, what should we do?
Maya:
Hmm... The police have pretty much made up their minds that Mr. Edgeworth did it. And Mr. Edgeworth won't tell us anything. I guess we could go look for clues down by the lake?
Phoenix:
Right.

Well, Miles Edgeworth shot someone with a pistol.
Grossberg:
Edgeworth!? What!? W-who!?
Phoenix:
Well, the identity of the victim is still unknown.
Grossberg:
T-this is terrible news indeed!
Phoenix:
(I guess he hadn't heard anything...)




That painting







Phoenix:
Mr. Grossberg? Whatever happened to that painting?
Grossberg:
Oh, yes... I do not think it shall ever be coming back home to this office. I can't exactly claim it as stolen... I suppose it's my just desserts. Old, bitter desserts.




Robert Hammond (appears after presenting Autopsy Report)







Phoenix:
Who is this Hammond guy, anyway?
Grossberg:
Mr. Hammond... He was the defense attorney in that case...
Phoenix:
"That case"...?
Grossberg:
Yes, the "DL-6 Incident."
Phoenix:
"DL-6"...? (Why does that sound so familiar?)
Grossberg:
Perhaps you remember?
Phoenix:
(I'm sure someone mentioned it during the trial for Mia's murder.)
Grossberg:
That was the incident where the police were so at a loss they used a spirit medium.
Maya:
...! Wait... you don't mean? Was that medium my mother?
Grossberg:
Yes, my dear. The spirit medium, Misty Fey, your mother, contacted the spirit of the victim. But... the case was a loss. No conviction was made.




The DL-6 Incident (appears after "Robert Hammond")







Grossberg:
The DL-6 Incident, yes... Happened 15 years ago. A very strange case, indeed.
Phoenix:
They never caught the criminal, right?
Grossberg:
Correct. Misty Fey used her powers to talk to the spirit of the late victim. Her testimony led to charges being laid against one man. But Mr. Hammond won the case and the suspect was declared innocent.
Maya:
... And the police blamed my mother, calling her a fraud. You were the one who helped her out then, right, Mr. Grossberg?
Grossberg:
Er... y-yes. Yes, quite.
Maya:
Thank you!
Grossberg:
N-no... please. D-don't mention it.
Phoenix:
... (DL-6... Never thought I'd hear that name again...)
Maya:
But wait... What does this case have anything to do with Mr. Edgeworth?
Grossberg:
It has everything to do with Mr. Edgeworth, my dear! The victim in the DL-6 Incident was none other than his father, Gregory Edgeworth!
Maya:
Wh-what!? His father!?
Grossberg:
... If you want to know more, you should ask him yourself. Show him this... I'm sure he'll talk to you.
Maya:
Wait... This is a photograph of my mother!
Misty Fey's Photo added to the Court Record.

Attorney's Badge







Grossberg:
You've really grown up in the past few years, my dear! How proud Mia would be if she could see you now!
Maya:
She said she was more worried about me than anything.
Phoenix:
Aww, just go on and take the compliment, will you?




Lotta's Camera







Grossberg:
So, this camera on the lake takes a photo whenever it hears an explosion sound?
Maya:
That's what she said.
Grossberg:
And it just happened to be set up on the beach, pointing out on the lake?
Maya:
Yes... she said it was to photograph "shooting stars."
Grossberg:
Hmm. Shooting stars... explosions... what's the connection? I'd be suspicious of this witness of yours.




Autopsy Report







Grossberg:
Hmm? Strange... I feel as though I've seen this man somewhere before! ... Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Phoenix:
Did you remember!?
Grossberg:
He was a lawyer! Here, in my office! That's Hammond! Robert Hammond!
Maya:
Mr. Hammond...?
Grossberg:
And you say this is the man Miles Edgeworth shot?




Lake Photo







Grossberg:
So this is the moment the crime took place, eh?
Phoenix:
Yes.
Grossberg:
You can't really say for sure that's Edgeworth. I'm not sure whether that's a good thing or a bad thing. Not sure at all...




Misty Fey's Photo







Grossberg:
Misty Fey. Mother of Mia and Maya Fey. Show this photograph to Miles Edgeworth. He'll have something to say to you then.

Phoenix:
Why did you go to Gourd Lake?
Edgeworth:
I have no intention of telling you.
Phoenix:
Nor, apparently, would you tell Detective Gumshoe.
Edgeworth:

Detective Gumshoe was really worried about you!
Edgeworth:

The DL-6 Incident (appears after presenting Misty Fey's Photo)







Edgeworth:
The "DL-6 Incident"... was when my father died. Right before my eyes... He was shot and killed, and I saw it all.
Maya:
...!
Edgeworth:
My memories from that time are... foggy. I suppose it's a self-defense mechanism. In any case, a suspect was arrested... a man. It's pretty clear he was the only one who could have killed my father. The spirit medium they used to talk to my late father said the same thing. It was an attorney by the name of Robert Hammond that cleared the suspect's name.
Phoenix:
And Hammond... is the victim in the Gourd Lake murder?
Edgeworth:
Correct.
Maya:
Umm... That spirit medium... that was my mom.
Edgeworth:
What? You mean you're...? ... It's strange. I thought that terrible incident was about to end, and now... this.
Phoenix:
"About to end"?
Edgeworth:
The DL-6 Incident happened 15 years ago. 15 years ago... on December 28.
Maya:
December 28?
Edgeworth:
The statute of limitations on the case runs out in three days.
Phoenix:
What!?
Maya:
Um, Nick? What does that mean?
Phoenix:
When a case's statute of limitations runs out, legally, the case never happened.
Edgeworth:
Three days from now, DL-6 will be closed... forever.




The suspect (appears after "The DL-6 Incident")







Maya:
What happened to the suspect? The one who got off innocent?
Edgeworth:
I don't know... He disappeared from public view. Nobody knows where to. If he's still alive, he'd be about 50 years old now.
Phoenix:
(I guess I can understand why he'd go into hiding... It'd be hard to live a normal life after being a murder suspect in such a big case.)




Your father (appears after "The DL-6 Incident")







Maya:
Umm... so, was your father a lawyer?
Edgeworth:
He was... Gregory Edgeworth. He was quite famous at the time, apparently.
Maya:
So, you were sort of trying to follow in his footsteps.
Edgeworth:

It's only been a matter of hours since you last visited. Yet you've made incredible progress in your investigation. I'll admit it, I'm impressed, Wright. You were always single-minded in your work, though. Once you start on something, you always see it through, don't you?
Phoenix:
About the "DL-6 Incident"...
Edgeworth:
Right... DL-6. I didn't want you to find out about it. That is why I refused your offer to defend me. I'm sorry if it sounded like I thought you weren't up to the job. I just wanted to keep you away from DL-6.
Phoenix:
So... do you still think it would have been better for me to stay away?
Edgeworth:
I don't know. But... I see no point in hiding anything from you now. Very well. Ask whatever you like, and I will answer to the best of my abilities.

So... what did Ms. Hart say?
Gumshoe:
She says she saw Mr. Edgeworth fire the pistol.
Maya:
What!?
Gumshoe:
She even had a photograph to prove it.
Phoenix:
Right. I saw it too... But you really can't tell from the photo who it is shooting.
Gumshoe:
That's why she said she's going to enlarge the photo. She said "it'll drop the quality a mite, but should let us see who's who!"
Maya:
She can do that!?
Phoenix:
(Okay, so there's going to be an enlarged photograph that shows Edgeworth in the act. Great. Just great.)
Gumshoe:
In any case, she's going to be the one testifying tomorrow.
Maya:
Huh? What happened to the other witness?
Gumshoe:
Well... Apparently, there was a cancellation.
Phoenix:
(A "cancellation"...!?)




Tomorrow's trial







Gumshoe:
I'm afraid tomorrow is going to be life or death for poor Mr. Edgeworth. We got a witness who says she saw the very moment of the murder. And we got a photo taken when the shot rang out.
Phoenix:
(I'd say that sounds like a pretty unwinnable case... But wait... What did Mia used to say? If he's innocent, there's got to be something I've overlooked...)




Edgeworth







Gumshoe:
It sound like Mr. Edgeworth is going to ask the state to assign a public defender. I was just asked to file the paperwork. But you still got time, pal! Go talk to him again, for me, please!

Karma...? (ellipsis and question mark highlighted in the original release)Edgeworth:
That's right, Manfred von Karma. He's the best prosecutor there is. He hasn't lost a case in his 40-year career. He is a god of prosecution, Wright! A god!Maya:
Not a single case?Edgeworth:
He'll do anything to get a guilty verdict, anything.Phoenix:
Hmm. Sounds like someone else I know, Edgeworth.Edgeworth:
Hmph. You don't understand. I mean he'll really do anything. Manfred von Karma is a man to be feared.Phoenix:
(That's quite a claim coming from someone who forges evidence...)Edgeworth:
He taught me what it really means to "prosecute."Phoenix:
Wh-what!?Edgeworth:
Just picture a prosecutor as vicious as me... multiplied by a factor of ten.Maya:
Ugh... So... so was he your teacher, then, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:
Something like that...Maya:
And now he's trying to get you found guilty!? What a creep! Oh, wait... Maybe he's planning on losing on purpose to help you out.Edgeworth:
Not a chance... He hasn't lost once in 40 years. 40 years! He's as ruthless as me, times twenty!Maya:
That's pretty ruthless...Edgeworth:
Like I said. He's a god among prosecutors.Phoenix:
(I guess that's something like Mia was to me. Speaking of Mia...) Um, Maya?Maya:
Uh huh?Phoenix:
We could really be using Mia's help right now... don't you think?Maya:
Oh...Phoenix:

I can't. Sorry. I tried, I really tried, but I couldn't reach.Phoenix:
You couldn't "reach"?Maya:

I'm really sorry. I'll try my best!Phoenix:
I hope so!Edgeworth:
What are you whispering about?Phoenix:
O-oh, it's nothing. Well, it's time. Let's head in...December 26, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Miles Edgeworth.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.Karma:
...Judge:
Err, Mr. von Karma? Is the prosecution ready?Karma:
... Fool... You seriously think that I would stand here were I not completely prepared?Judge:
R-right, my apologies!Phoenix:
(He's even got the Judge scared!)Judge:
Very well, your opening statement, please.Karma:
... Decisive evidence... A decisive witness... What else could possibly be required?Judge:
Ah... er, nothing of course. That should be fine. The prosecution may call its first witness.Maya:
What's with this guy? Is he royalty or something?Phoenix:
How am I supposed to fight against this!?Karma:
I call the detective in charge of this case, Detective Dick Gumshoe.Phoenix:
(Okay, Gumshoe's first... Let's see how this goes.)Karma:
Describe the incident. Now!Gumshoe:
Y-yessir!Phoenix:
(Detective Gumshoe looks nervous...)Gumshoe:
Er, please take a look at the map. The murder happened late Christmas Eve, around midnight. There was one boat in the very middle of the lake. There were two men on the boat. Now, there happened to be a woman camping here on the edge of the lake. At 12:10 AM, she heard two pistol shots. Then the boat started to move. It went towards the boat rental shop.Karma:
Hmm.Overhead Map added to the Court Record.Karma:
Testify to the court about your arrest. Now!Judge:
W-w-wait! Mr. von Karma...Karma:
Yes?Judge:
Actually, I'm the one that's supposed to be handling these proceedings...Karma:
Wrong. There is only one thing you need to do here. You will slam down your gavel and say the word "guilty." That is your role!Judge:
Y-yes, of course. You're quite right.Phoenix:
(No, he's not!!!)Witness Testimony-- The Arrest of Edgeworth --Gumshoe:
A man called into the station around 30 minutes after midnight.
We headed to the scene of the crime as fast as we could.
That's where we found Mr. Edgeworth.
Now, I didn't suspect him of anything at all.
But... the next morning, a body was found in the lake.
So we had to arrest Mr. Edgeworth.Judge:

You received a call from a "man"?
Gumshoe:
Er... yup.
Phoenix:
But you said there was a woman camping there? She was the one who heard the two gunshots, right?
Karma:

Karma:
That woman and the "man" who called in the report are two different people, obviously!
Phoenix:
Different people?
Karma:
There were two witnesses!
Phoenix:
(Urk!)
Karma:
Their testimonies were quite similar however. Today I've summoned the woman who was camping.

How long was it between receiving the report and your arrival at the lake?

Our motto for the month is "get there quick."

Karma:
Detective! You will refrain from casually revealing department secrets!

Continue! Now!Gumshoe:
But... the next morning, a body was found in the lake.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Did you find any clues on the body?
Gumshoe:
A single bullet was recovered from the body. He was shot through the heart... fatally.

Was the bullet found in the body fired from this pistol?Gumshoe:
Yes. The ballistic markings on the bullet match the pistol.Judge:
Hmm...Maya:
Hey, Nick! What does he mean, "ballistic markings"?Karma:
Shocking! To imagine someone here does not know something as basic as ballistic markings!Maya:
N-Nick! He's glaring at me!Karma:
Tsk... very well, I'll explain. Actually, Judge! You do it.Judge:
Eh? M-me? ... Erm, ahem. Ballistic markings are like the "fingerprints" of a gun. The barrel leaves distinctive marks on each bullet it fires. You can examine these "ballistic fingerprints" to see which gun fired the shot. It's quite accurate.Karma:
Indeed. This leads to one, inevitable conclusion: the bullet found in the victim's heart... was, without a doubt, fired from this pistol. This pistol which, as you may recall, was covered with the defendant's own fingerprints!Judge:
O-order! Order!Phoenix:
(This is bad... This makes it look like Edgeworth did it!)Karma:
Well, Judge?Judge:
I'd say it's almost decisive, yes. Honestly, I could declare a verdict at this point. However...Karma:
You wish to hear the witness speak, no doubt. Very well. I am somewhat fatigued, and so I will take a brief break. I will call my witness after the recess. Which will last ten minutes. Judge!Judge:
Y-yes?Karma:
What are you doing? A ten minute recess! Now!Judge:

Y-you mean it was a suicide!?Edgeworth:

Er... very well. Your testimony, please.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Lotta:
It was Christmas Eve, just after midnight, I reckon.
I was in my car.
I heard this "bang" come up from the lake.
When I looked out the window, I saw two gents in a boat.
Then there was another "bang"...
There wasn't nary a thing on the lake but that boat.Karma:
Enough.Lotta:
Huh?Karma:
Judge! She happened to take a photo of the incident! This is that photo. Accept it as evidence.Judge:
W-well! This is a surprise! This looks like... the very moment of the murder! O-Order! I will remove you from the court if I do not have order immediately!Karma:
As the witness testified, she looked at the lake when she heard the shot. There were no other boats on that lake! So, the man in the boat with the victim must have been the one who shot him... Yes. It was the defendant, Miles Edgeworth!!!Judge:
Order! Order! Order...! I will have order!Karma:
... Well, Judge?Judge:
The evidence is... decisive. I have very little doubt about this case. Very well, this court finds the defendant...Phoenix:Phoenix:
W-wait! Your Honor! I haven't cross-examined the witness yet!Karma:
A cross-examination? We have photographic proof! What question can there possibly be!? This photo is worth a thousand words... and they all read "guilty"! You lose. Or... Do you claim to have found a contradiction in her testimony!?Phoenix:
...!Karma:
Very well. If you have to, you may cross-examine the witness. You will only flounder and ask meaningless questions! You will fail to find anything! And then, I will have you held in contempt of court!Maya:

He'll bang down that "flimsy gavel" of his and declare Edgeworth guilty.

Huh? Wait, so you're thinking maybe he was shot from some other place? I don't think so, nope. The lake was smooth as glass, and nobody was on the shore, neither.
Phoenix:
(Hmm...)Present Gourdy Article







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Ms. Hart!"Phoenix:
(I'd better find some sort of contradiction in this testimony... I won't be able to beat von Karma any other way... There has to be something!)Phoenix:
Ms. Hart! Were you REALLY looking at that boat!?Lotta:
W-what's with you!? Course I was looking at it! It was the only thing out there! Any normal person'd be looking at it!Phoenix:
I agree, any normal person would. But you are far from normal!Lotta:
Wh-what!? Y'all wanna step over here and say that!?Phoenix:
You were camping at the lake to take a picture of Gourdy! Think about it-- What would you do if you heard a loud noise? You'd be scanning the lake for any sign of Gourdy, that's what! You wouldn't give the boat a second thought!Lotta:
Aah!Judge:
Order! Continue, Mr. Wright!Phoenix:
You testified that you were watching the boat through binoculars! However, you wouldn't need binoculars to watch that boat! You needed them to search for Gourdy... and that's what you were doing!Lotta:
...! ... ...Phoenix:
Well!?Lotta:
Hmph... Well, now that y'all mention it... I did sort of take my binoculars and kind of scan the lake a bit... I mean, Gourdy might be out there, n' all...Judge:
M-Ms. Hart! A-are you saying that you were NOT watching the boat, then?Lotta:
... S-sorry, y'all. I wasn't fibbing, really. I was, just... I thought y'know, I could be witness to a murder n' all! I kinda got excited. I was sure I was watching that boat... till now.Judge:
... This... this is totally uncalled for--Lotta:
B-but hey! You got the photograph! You got proof!Judge:
Hmm... Still, we can't see who is shooting who in this.Lotta:
Right! Right! That's why I took this photo n'...Karma:Karma:
Witness... That's enough. You've had a long day. Shut your pie-hole.Lotta:
Sh-shut my what!?Phoenix:
(What was she going to say? She took the photo... and what? Wait a second...)Gumshoe:
She even had a photograph to prove it.Phoenix:
But you really can't tell from the photo who is shooting.Gumshoe:
That's why she said she's going to enlarge the photo. She said "it'll drop the quality a mite, but should let us see who's who!"Phoenix:
(She enlarged that photo! Why won't von Karma let her show it? I've got a hunch! I bet that enlarged photo shows something bad for von Karma! This is my chance! If I'm wrong, though, it'll mean prison for Edgeworth... or worse. What should I do!?)Make her show the enlargement







Leads to:
"Ms. Hart! Look at this photograph."Wait and see what happens







Phoenix:
(If this is a trap... I'd better hold back and see how things go. But... if I wait now, the cross-examination will be over! Can I really risk that!?)



Do nothing







Judge:
This hereby ends the cross-examination of Ms. Lotta Hart.
Karma:
And none too soon. That was a flagrant waste of my time.
Judge:
Mr. von Karma, do you have anything to add?
Karma:
I stated everything I needed to when this trial began. Decisive evidence. A decisive witness. What else could possibly be required?
Judge:
Nothing, of course.
Phoenix:
(Oh no! I should have pressed further!)
Judge:
This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court find the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth...

Guilty

Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!
Game over




Rethink position







Phoenix:
(I have to fight now or I could lose everything!)
Leads to:
"Ms. Hart! Look at this photograph."Phoenix:
Ms. Hart! Look at this photograph. You enlarged this photograph, did you not?Lotta:
Y-yeah! I did!Phoenix:
Why has that enlargement not been presented to the court!?Karma:Karma:
B-because it does not exist!Lotta:
What're y'all talking about!? You were the one who told me not to show it in court in the first place! You old fool!Judge:
What's the meaning of this, Mr. von Karma!Karma:
Er... erm...Phoenix:
Ms. Hart! Show the photo to the court! Show us the enlargement!Karma:Karma:
The prosecution objects to the submission of this evidence!Judge:
Objection... denied. The witness will show the enlargement to the court.Lotta:
Here it is.Judge:
Hmm. We still cannot see who is firing in this. It could be the defendant... or maybe it's not. Regardless, I'll accept this as evidence.Lake Photo added to the Court Record.Karma:
Happy now, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:
Hmm... (There has to be something!)Karma:
You asked for the enlargement, you got the enlargement. And little good it has done any of us! That's why I requested she not show it!Judge:
Hmm... I suppose this means that the cross-examination...Karma:
Is over! Obviously!Judge:
Then, I would like to close the cross-examination of Ms. Lotta Hart.Karma:
And none too soon. That was a flagrant waste of my time.Judge:
Mr. von Karma, do you have anything to add?Karma:
I stated everything I needed to when this trial began. Decisive evidence. A decisive witness. What else could possibly be required?Judge:
Nothing, of course. Then, I believe it is time for me to declare my verdict.Phoenix:
(Wait... it's not supposed to go like this! There has to be a clue in this photo... somewhere! This is bad! Real bad! What should I do!?)Object to the enlargement







Leads to:
"Your Honor!"Show other evidence







Phoenix:
W-wait! Your Honor, This evidence...
Karma:

Karma:
I believe we have spent enough time talking about evidence!
Judge:
Hmm... indeed. We've heard opinions on every piece of evidence but this enlargement. I see no point in retracing our steps.
Leads back to:
"This is bad! Real bad! What should I do!?"Wait and see







Phoenix:
(Uh oh... think of something! No good... I guess I'll just sit back and see how this turns out.)
Judge:
Very well! Allow me to state my verdict.
Phoenix:
(Oh no! I should have pressed further!)
Judge:
This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court find the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth...

Guilty

Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!
Game overPhoenix:
Your Honor! There is something decidedly strange with this enlargement!Judge:
W-what might that be? Mr. Wright... You will show the court what you mean! What about this photo is "strange"?Phoenix:
(Okay... here goes nothing! I'll show the judge what's strange about this photo.)Present shooter's hand or pistol







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Here, Your Honor!"Present shooter







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Here, your honor!
Judge:
The shooter...? I'm not sure I understand. What about the shooter is strange? Can you be more specific?
Phoenix:
(Specific, right...)
Leads back to:
"I'll show the judge what's strange about this photo."Present anywhere else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Here, Your Honor!
Judge:
Where...? Mr. Wright, I understand you're in a tight spot. However! You have nothing to gain by making baseless claims of faulty evidence!
Phoenix:
Y-Your Honor! Never mind that... my, my finger slipped! Please let me show you again!
Judge:
Hmm...
Leads back to:
"I'll show the judge what's strange about this photo."Phoenix:
Here, Your Honor!Judge:
The shooter...? I'm not sure I understand. What about the shooter is strange?Phoenix:
Look at the hand holding the pistol, Your Honor!Judge:
The hand...?Phoenix:
That hand directly contradicts another piece of evidence!Judge:
This man's left hand does what...!?Phoenix:
Let me show you. I'll show you the evidence that left hand contradicts!Present Pistol







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"The evidence is clear."Present anything else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
(Hmm... I'm not sure this warrants a "take that!" I'd better think this one through!)
Judge:
Mr. Wright, please hurry up. We haven't got all day.
Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor! Right away!
Leads back to:
"I'll show you the evidence that left hand contradicts!"Phoenix:
The evidence is clear. The man in this photograph is holding that pistol in his left hand. However! The prints on the murder weapon were from Edgeworth's "right hand"! Ergo! The man shooting the pistol in this photograph... Is not Mr. Edgeworth!!!Judge:
Now that everyone in the courtroom has quieted down... I would like to reconvene this court of law! Mr. Wright.Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.Judge:
You have given us definitive proof today. We now know that it was not Mr. Edgeworth who fired the pistol that night. However... This leaves us with a rather large problem. If Mr. Edgeworth didn't do it, then who shot our victim?Karma:
Precisely! As we have seen, there were no other people on the lake that night! Who but the defendant could have shot the victim!?Ms. Hart







Phoenix:
Who else but the witness, Ms. Lotta Hart!
Judge:
Wh-what!? Do you have proof of this!?
Phoenix:
(Proof-shmoof! Always with the proof! Oh... wait, I do need proof, don't I.)
Judge:
Mr. Wright! I'll have you remember this is a court of law!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh. The Judge is mad.)
Karma:
Let me ask again!
Leads back to:
"Who but the defendant could have shot the victim!?"The victim himself







Leads to:
"There is only one explanation remaining!"Larry







Phoenix:
(Wait, wait--I can't do that. Sacrifice one friend to save another? What's the point!?)
Karma:
Well, Wright! Your answer!
Leads back to:
"Who but the defendant could have shot the victim!?"Phoenix:
There is only one explanation remaining! The man who shot the victim was none other than... the victim himself!!!Judge:
Order! Order! So... you are saying that the victim committed suicide?Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. I can think of no other explanation.Judge:
Hmm... Indeed, that does seem to be the only remaining option.Karma:Karma:
I'm so very, very sorry, Mr. Wright. But suicide is out of the question.Phoenix:
Wh-what!?Karma:
An examination of the victim's wound reveals the distance at which he was shot.Phoenix:
The... distance?Karma:
The victim was clearly shot from further than a meter away!Phoenix:
A meter! Th-that's three feet!Karma:
There is no way it could have been suicide!Judge:
Order! Order! Mr. von Karma! Are you sure of the accuracy of your data!?Karma:
Of course! I had already considered the possibility of suicide, you see.Autopsy Report updated in the Court Record.Judge:
Hmm... I see. Very well, allow me to state my opinion. Considering the situation, the shooter had to be the defendant, Mr. Edgeworth. However! The prints on the gun reveal that the shooter was not Mr. Edgeworth. This is a conundrum. Therefore, I would like to suspend proceedings for this trial for the day. The court orders the defense and the prosecution to further investigate this matter. Understood?Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.Karma:
...Judge:
That is all. The court is adjourned.December 26, 1:15 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2Phoenix:
Whew, that was a close one.Edgeworth:
...Phoenix:
Hey! Don't you have anything to say!?Edgeworth:
No. I have yet to be declared innocent, Wright.Phoenix:
Well, yeah, but... What happened out there on that lake, anyway!? If he didn't commit suicide, then who...? The shooter was about a meter away, too!Edgeworth:
... W-what? Don't give me that look! I did not kill him!Phoenix:
I was just kidding around.Edgeworth:
Hmph.Phoenix:
Look... I'm going to go check on Maya.Edgeworth:
Oh... Wright.Phoenix:
What?Edgeworth:
Tell her something for me.Phoenix:
What?Edgeworth:
... ... ... Tell... Tell her to watch what she says in court. That's all.Phoenix:
(Would it kill you to just state how you really feel with a "thanks", Edgeworth?) (Changed from [Yeah, I'm sure she'll be happy to hear you say that, Edgeworth. Jerk!] in the original release)Phoenix:
I requisitioned a transcript of Lotta's entire testimony. I thought it might give me some ammunition for the trial tomorrow. Of course she didn't see the shooter... So the only part of her testimony that stood was the "bang" she heard.Lotta's Deposition added to the Court Record.To be continued.Presenting wrong evidence during testimony







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Judge:
...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...
Phoenix:
Huh? Really?
Judge:
Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)Presenting wrong evidence during testimony







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
Judge:
Uh... I'm not sure I follow?
Phoenix:
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
Judge:
You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)Presenting wrong evidence during testimony







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
How exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...?
Phoenix:
They aren't, are they...
Judge:
Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)Presenting wrong evidence during testimony







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
Judge:
... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Ugh. I must be on the wrong track?)Too many penalties







Judge:
This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court find the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth...

Maya!Maya:
Hey! Nick, it's you! I'm glad Mr. Edgeworth made it through the day okay. It's a relief...Phoenix:
Hey. Why'd you do that, anyway?Maya:
... I don't know. I... just knew I had to do something. I know I'm not the lawyer my sister was... ... I'm sorry.Phoenix:
Well, you did save the trial... Just, behave from now on, okay?Maya:
O... Okay.Talk









Questioning







Phoenix:
Have you been questioned yet?
Maya:
No... not yet. Detective Gumshoe was here just now. He said "seeing as this is your first offense, we'll let you go after questioning."
Phoenix:
Whew...
Maya:
Oh, and he wanted me to get bail money ready. You can pay for me, okay?
Phoenix:
Huh? How much?
Maya:
I don't know. I guess they'll send you a bill or something.
Phoenix:
(Why do I picture giant bales of money every time I hear the word "bail"?)




Mia







Phoenix:
Any luck with Mia...?
Maya:
None... I can't get through to her at all. I tried... I really did! I don't know what to do... ... I think I probably shouldn't have stopped my training.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... she sounds like she really did do her best. I should check and see if there are any waterfalls in the local area...)
Maya:
I wonder if I'll ever see my sister again...Present









Attorney's Badge







Maya:
It must be nice, Nick. You can just show that to anyone and say "I'm a lawyer!" But, spirit mediums, well...
Phoenix:
I dunno, with your clothes, I bet at least some people would recognize you...
Maya:
But these are medium-in-training clothes... I wonder if I'll ever be a proper medium...




Lake Photo







Maya:
Isn't that the enlarged photo Lotta was talking about?
Phoenix:
Uh huh.
Maya:
Huh... It's nice and big... but you can't really see the faces any clearer, can you?




Misty Fey's Photo







Maya:
My... mother. ...
Phoenix:
(Now that I've shown her the picture, I'm not so sure it was the right thing to do. No... I'm pretty sure it was the wrong thing to do.)




Gourdy Article







Maya:
I want to see Gourdy, too!
Phoenix:
If he really exists.
Maya:
Well, I'd say a photograph is pretty good proof! Once this trial is over, let's get some fishing poles and go down to the lake!
Phoenix:
(Even if there is a monster in that lake, fishing poles sound like a BAD idea...)




Pistol Bullet







Maya:
So the markings on this bullet and the barrel of the pistol matched?
Phoenix:
Hey, I'm surprised you remembered that!
Maya:
How could I forget after von Karma rubbed it in so much? So, which one of these are the ballistic markings?
Phoenix:
I'm... not really sure.




Pistol







Maya:
Mr. Edgeworth's prints are on this pistol, aren't they?
Phoenix:
Yes... the prints from his right hand. But they must have gotten on there at some other time other than the shooting.
Maya:
What? Really!?
Phoenix:
(The shooter used his left hand, after all...)




Anything else







Maya:
Sorry... I'm fresh out of ideas.December 26Wright & Co. Law OfficesPhoenix:
... Sure is quiet here with nobody around. Right... I have to get Maya out of that detention cell soon!December 26Police DepartmentCriminal AffairsPhoenix:
(Detective Gumshoe's not here...)Police:
Gumshoe's at the scene again today.Phoenix:
Huh? Oh, really?Police:
He's a live wire that one. Got into a fight with the chief for not following protocol...Phoenix:
(Not following protocol...? I bet he wouldn't help them build the case against Edgeworth...)Examine









Detective







Phoenix:
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
Police:
"Don't do anything rash! Why jump...? ...You have every reason to live!"
Phoenix:
... He must be doing image training for talking down a potential suicide.




Chief







Phoenix:
This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen.
Chief:
Wha...!? Rook to Bishop 7... Checkmate!? I don't believe it!
Phoenix:
(He must be playing chess on the computer...)December 26Grossberg Law OfficesPhoenix:
Apparently, Mr. Grossberg is on vacation today. Well, I guess I can come back tomorrow if I need anything.Examine









Bookshelf







Phoenix:
Expensive-looking mahogany bookshelves, filled with expensive-looking books. Hmm... funny... they don't look like they've ever been read.




Desk







Phoenix:
A solid mahogany desk. The wood's been polished to a deep luster.




Vacant wall







Phoenix:
I guess Mr. Grossberg isn't getting that painting back. I feel kind of bad for him...




Potted plant







Phoenix:
An expensive potted plant. No idea what kind of plant it is, but it's probably the most expensive one available.




Table







Phoenix:
A table for clients. Hmm... an elegant ebony case, and if I'm not mistaken, that lighter's made of solid gold. Even I can tell someone here's got money to burn.December 26Gourd Lake ParkEntrancePhoenix:
There are fewer than there were yesterday, but the cops are still around in the park. I wonder if Detective Gumshoe is here today?Examine









Trees







Phoenix:
I feel winter's chill from the bare leaf trees today... There's a lot of trees here. I guess that's why they call it a "nature park." It's quite pretty when the cherry trees along the lakeside blossom in spring. Today... it's just cold.




Sign







Phoenix:
The sign says "Gourd Lake Nature Park." This place is full of families picnicking on the weekend. It's a little cold for picnicking these days, though.December 26Gourd LakePublic BeachPhoenix:
Haven't seen Larry around at all. Probably off paying through the nose on a date with the lovely Kiyance...Examine









Lake







Phoenix:
The famous Gourd Lake... Its green waters stretch out on both sides... It's a pretty big lake, really.December 26Boat Rental ShopPhoenix:
(Looks like the boat rental shop is closed today, too.)Examine









Shop







Phoenix:
A small boat rental shop. Doesn't look like anyone is around. They're probably closed because of the murder.




Boats







Phoenix:
There are some boats floating at the dock. The murder took place in a boat from this dock... Apparently, the police took away the actual boat that was used that night. Indeed, there's space for one more boat at the dock.December 26Gourd Lake WoodsPhoenix:
Hey, Detective Gumshoe!Gumshoe:
Hey, pal! The trial today, it, er... ...Phoenix:
Yes? What about the trial?Gumshoe:
Well, I was going to say "good show," but it wasn't really all that... Though you did save Mr. Edgeworth, I guess... (Changed from [Though you did save Edgeworth, I guess...] in the original release) I just wasn't sure how to thank you... you know?Phoenix:
Er... thanks.Examine









Camera







Phoenix:
Lotta's camera is staring out at the lake, as usual. Even a novice like me can tell that camera must cost a pretty penny. I hope she doesn't leave it out here to get stolen.




Sign







Phoenix:
The sign says "No Camping." Funny place to pick to pitch your tent.




Campfire







Phoenix:
I wonder why she brought a camping cooker with her? There's a convenience store right up the street... I guess she wanted to get into the outdoor spirit.




SUV







Phoenix:
I don't think Lotta takes very good care of her SUV. It's covered with dents. I can't believe anyone would drive their car down here.Talk









Tomorrow's trial







Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe? Any idea what strategy von Karma is planning for tomorrow?
Gumshoe:
It sounds like he's bringing in another witness!
Phoenix:
Another witness!? Oh, right, he said something about that in the trial today...


Karma:
There were two witnesses!


Phoenix:
I was wondering who that other witness was! Er... who was it?
Gumshoe:
S... sorry, pal. As much as I'd like to, I'm not at liberty to divulge that information.
Phoenix:
(Right...)




Prosecutor Edgeworth







Phoenix:
Oh, right... I wanted to ask you something about Edgeworth.
Gumshoe:
What's up?
Phoenix:
Is he afraid of earthquakes? I never heard anything about that before.
Gumshoe:
... Mr. Edgeworth doesn't talk about himself too much, see. But there's one thing that's clear as day... Him hating crime the way he does... And him becoming a lawyer... And him being scared of earthquakes... It all started with that incident.
Phoenix:
The DL-6 Incident?
Gumshoe:
Yep, that's the one. Fifteen years ago... when he saw his father shot before his very eyes! He still feels the pain now, you can see it in his eyes.




Maya Fey







Phoenix:
I wanted to talk to you about Maya Fey...
Gumshoe:
Huh? She's not out on bail yet? That's strange. I told 'em to let her go as soon as they had their report written up. Man... I don't know what would have happened in that courtroom today if it weren't for her. Seeing her getting dragged out by the bailiff... I'll be honest with you, pal. I shed a tear or two. Mr. Edgeworth, he was so moved I saw his lip trembling. (Changed from [Edgeworth, he was so moved I saw his lip trembling.] in the original release)
Phoenix:
Really!? (Cold-as-ice Edgeworth!?)
Gumshoe:
He was really grateful for what she did, you know.Present









Attorney's Badge







Gumshoe:
I think it's a little early for you to be proudly waving that thing around. You can be proud of yourself when you get Mr. Edgeworth declared innocent, pal!




Lotta's Camera







Gumshoe:
That woman really took us for a ride, didn't she? Claiming she was a witness to a murder and all...
Phoenix:
Still, if it weren't for her photograph, Mr. Edgeworth wouldn't have made it today.
Gumshoe:
Oh, huh, really?
Phoenix:
(Umm... you were at the trial, weren't you, Detective?)




Robert's Autopsy Report







Gumshoe:
Robert Hammond... He was the defense attorney in the DL-6 Incident trial. He's the one who got the sole suspect off the hook. I wonder what Mr. Edgeworth thinks of him. Not much, I'd wager.




Lake Photo







Gumshoe:
I don't care who you are, no one can tell me that that's Mr. Edgeworth! I mean, come on, it doesn't look like him at all!
Phoenix:
But Edgeworth has admitted he was on the boat.
Gumshoe:
Then he's the one being shot, then!
Phoenix:
He seemed fine in court today...
Gumshoe:
... Details, pal, details! Whose side are you on, anyway?
Phoenix:
(All I'm saying is we have to respect the evidence...)




Pistol Bullet







Gumshoe:
Yep, it was fired from the murder weapon, without a doubt.
Phoenix:
From a meter away... so it would have to have been from someone else on the boat.
Gumshoe:
Hmm...
Phoenix:
What do you make of this, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
Hey, making something of things is your job!
Phoenix:
Er... right. (Since when do lawyers have to do detectives' work for them!?)




Pistol







Gumshoe:
Maybe you should tell me why Mr. Edgeworth's prints were on the weapon, pal.
Phoenix:
Huh? How should I know!?




Lotta's Deposition







Gumshoe:
Now, she heard two gunshots, right?
Phoenix:
But wait... Look at the Court Record! According to this, the murder weapon was fired three times!
Gumshoe:
What!? How's that possible!?
Phoenix:
Where was the third shot fired?
Gumshoe:
I wonder... Maybe it was a practice shot or something?




Anything else







Gumshoe:
Sorry to disappoint you, pal. I'm drawing a blank.After clearing all Talk options:Gumshoe:
I'm going to head back to the station. I'll get the report on Maya and get her out of there as soon as I can.Phoenix:
Thank you. Oh, wait! Umm... I was wondering, how much is bail going to be?Gumshoe:
Don't worry about that. Mr. Edgeworth is posting the whole amount.Phoenix:
What? Edgeworth...?Gumshoe:
Didn't I tell you? He's grateful to her for what she did. Alright, pal. Well don't forget to go pick her up, okay?Phoenix:
(Hmm... Maybe I can get Edgeworth to pay this month's rent, too...)After clearing all Talk options in Gourd Lake Woods:December 26Detention CenterVisitor's RoomMaya:
Hey, Nick! You finally came! They just finished the paperwork, I'm free to go.Phoenix:
Free at last, eh?Maya:
Those interrogators were really mean! They were like "okay, what did you do THIS time?" Like I was some kind of criminal! Can you believe it?Phoenix:
Well, they let you out in the end, didn't they?Maya:
Mmm... Oh, that reminds me... Thanks for bail.Phoenix:
Thank Edgeworth.Maya:
Huh?Phoenix:
He posted bail for you. Said he was grateful for what you did.Maya:
Mr. Edgeworth did that...? ... I have to make it up to him! We've got to win this case, Nick!Talk









What to do







Phoenix:
What do you think we should do next?
Maya:
We're kind of lacking in the clues department. We could go to the park and look for Gourdy.
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
I-I was kidding!
Phoenix:
Still, if there are any clues out there, the park's as good a bet as any. What do you say? Shall we head down there?
Maya:
Sure!




Any ideas







Phoenix:
Have you noticed anything lately?
Maya:
Hmm... You know, I did notice one thing while I was here in detention. It's really pretty comfortable here. It's warm, and they keep it very clean.
Phoenix:
I meant have you noticed anything about the case...?
Maya:
Well... Not much more than that, no.
Phoenix:
(She's probably still upset about Mia. I should leave her alone.)Wright & Co. Law OfficesMaya:
Ahh! Fresh air! I gotta say, freedom feels great.Phoenix:
Behave yourself in the courtroom tomorrow, okay?Maya:
Heh heh heh. Misbehaving's much more fun.Phoenix:
It's not going to be so much fun when Edgeworth refuses to pay your bail again.Maya:
... Right. I'll behave.Phoenix:
(Oh dear...)Talk









What to do







Phoenix:
Well, what should we do?
Maya:
I don't know! I've been in detention this whole time. I think I'll let you decide what we should do. Deal?




Any ideas







Phoenix:
Well? Any thoughts you want to share?
Maya:
Well, I was detention all day. I think I'd like more time to think.

Hey y'all!Maya:
Hey, it's Lotta!Lotta:
Y'all really did it today...Phoenix:
Wh-what did we do now?Lotta:
Naw, I'm not complaining! See, I did a little thinking. A little... self-reflection, you might say. I realized that bein' a witness is a mighty big responsibility. But I just went up there and started blabbing any old thing that came to mind.Phoenix:
Lotta...Lotta:
So, you see, I want to make it up to y'all.Phoenix:
"Make it up"...?Talk









Today's trial







Phoenix:
What did you think of the trial?
Lotta:
To be honest, I was doin' it half just to say I'd been a witness... Even though I didn't really see anything. I kinda convinced myself I had though... I'm sorry, I know I caused y'all a lot of trouble.
Maya:
Well, memory is a tricky, vague little thing.
Lotta:
Yeah, I sure know that now. I'll be fine the next time I witness a murder!
Maya:
Right!
Phoenix:
(You mean the FIRST time you witness a murder...)




Gourdy







Phoenix:
What about Gourdy?
Lotta:
Right! Well, the way I figure, the trial's only stoking the flames of Gourdy fever! I'll get my exclusive photos and rocket to stardom!
Maya:
All right, Lotta! You go, girl! I wish I could be an investigative photographer too!
Phoenix:
(Finish your spirit medium training first!)




Making it up







Phoenix:
Lotta, what do you mean by "making it up to us"?
Lotta:
Well, ya see... Actually, I got a bit of information for you.
Maya:
What!?
Lotta:
That von Karma didn't want me to say nothin' about it.
Maya:
Wh-what information!?
Lotta:
Now we're getting to the heart of it! See, I reckoned we might be able to do ourselves a little "exchange."
Phoenix:
E-"exchange"? Umm... I thought this was to "make it up to us"...?
Lotta:
Right! I propose a little exchange, to make it up to you!
Phoenix:
...
Lotta:
What!? Information don't come cheap, my friend!
Maya:
Uh...
Lotta:
Hey! I see you thinking "my, how unsophisticated these southern folks are"!!! It's written all over yer face! Let me tell you, most southerners are WAY more sophisticated than you... I'm just the exception, okay? Well, what'll it be? We gonna deal, or not!?
Maya:
Wh-what should we do, Nick?



Deal







Phoenix:
(We don't have any other leads so I don't think we have a choice here...) Okay. How much?
Lotta:
Huh? You completely off your rocker? I may not be sophisticated, but I'm not trying to rob the poor!
Leads to:
"Huh?"




No deal







Phoenix:
I'm sorry... But I've no intention of dealing with you!
Maya:
Nor do we have any money, anyway!
Lotta:
You guys make a fine team, you know that? And I can tell you don't have any money, just look at those clothes!

Phoenix:

Lotta:
I'm glad I did that enlargement.
Phoenix:
No kidding. If we didn't have that, Edgeworth would be in prison now, or worse!
Maya:
There's never a lack of drama when you're on a case, is there, Nick?
Lotta:
What, are you always on the verge of horrible failure like this!?
Phoenix:
Umm...
Lotta:
Careful or the stress'll send you to an early grave.
Phoenix:
(Thanks for the cheerful message of support!)




Gourdy Article







Maya:
Umm... uh... You know, I was wondering...
Lotta:
Yeah?
Maya:
What if you get a picture of Gourdy... and it turns out like this enlargement did?
Lotta:
Y'all crazy!? A blurry picture like this doesn't make a hit story! I need a picture that screams "I am Gourdy! Hear me roar!" I can't turn something like this into the paper! What kind of fool do y'all think I am?
Phoenix:
(The kind of fool that would turn a blurry picture in as evidence in a murder trial? Not to mention claiming she saw something she didn't see!)

Lotta:
Yep, I'd have to say I know exactly squat about that.

Flags







Phoenix:
Those flags look sadly out of place here. Flapping listlessly back and forth in a cold wind under a cold sky...
Maya:
I dunno, I think it kind of gives the place a festival atmosphere. It reminds me of the "War of the Eyeglasses"!
Phoenix:
...? The war of the what!?
Maya:
Huh? What? You mean, you don't know the War of the Eyeglasses?
Phoenix:

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Doesn't that Steel Samurai look a little out of place? I mean, it's so huge... I guess it's good advertising.
Maya:
... Something about this Steel Samurai just doesn't work for me.
Phoenix:
Huh? Really? It looks pretty well made to me.
Maya:
Hmph. Still a novice, aren't you, Nick. Really... True connoisseurs like Cody and me don't fall for this kind of stuff.
Phoenix:

That? That's a compressor. I use it to fill up that balloon there with air.

Edgeworth







Butz:
Yo, Nick! What happened with Edgeworth?
Phoenix:
Well, we made it through the first day in court all right... I don't know how good our prospects are from here on, though.
Butz:
Huh.
Maya:
Hey, Larry, did you know Edgeworth's secret weakness? He's terrified of earthquakes! He acts like a little boy!
Butz:
Huh? That's weird. I don't think he was ever like that in school.
Maya:
No? Really?
Butz:
Well, we were only in the same class for a year. He transferred schools pretty quickly...
Maya:
Transferred?
Phoenix:
(Right... when the DL-6 Incident happened. Doesn't look like Larry knows about it, though.)




The big samurai







Phoenix:
Hey, Larry. What was that big... thing up there before?
Butz:
Huh? Oh, the big guy? I've had that for about a month, yeah. It's a big hit with the kids!
Phoenix:
Why wasn't it there yesterday?
Butz:
Huh? Huh!? Oh... right. Th-the compressor was busted.
Maya:
Compressor?
Butz:
Yeah--it's that little unit by my hotdog stand. That what I use to put air in the Steel Samurai! It broke a little while ago so I sent it in for repairs.

Oh. And here I thought you'd inflated it by yourself.Present

What happened







Lotta:
I learned something in today's trial, that's for sure. Testifyin' is serious business! That's why I decided not to talk about that case any more.
Maya:
Huh?
Phoenix:
Whoa--didn't you say you had information about the case!? Tell us that, at least!
Lotta:
Like I said... I'll trade it for the dirt on Gourdy!




Gourdy

What are you going to do if Gourdy doesn't exist?
Lotta:
I'll quit being an investigative photographer.

Phoenix:
How is the investigation proceeding?
Gumshoe:
It's not, really. We have another meeting coming up... We're supposed to talk about Mr. Edgeworth's motive...
Maya:
His motive?
Gumshoe:
See, Mr. Edgeworth's father died in the DL-6 Incident... And the guy who got the lone suspect declared innocent was the victim in this case... Robert Hammond. They're saying that's why Mr. Edgeworth shot him.
Phoenix:
(And Edgeworth never talks about his past... I bet they'll drag that out and hit him with it in court tomorrow, too...)

Poor Edgeworth...
Gumshoe:
I gotta admit, it doesn't look good, pal.

BLAAAAM!

Butz:
The valve just busted open and the whole thing took off! The tank shot up in the air like a rocket... And it took my poor deflated Steel Samurai with it! Man, what a sight that was.
Maya:
I wish I could have seen it!
Phoenix:
Me too.Gourd Lake WoodsTalk









Gourdy







Lotta:
Well, Mister Lawyer? I've got the info y'all need! Y'all got the scoop on Gourdy for me yet?



Nothing yet







Phoenix:
It's not going to be that easy to find him, you know.
Lotta:
You'd better hurry or you won't have that info in time for the trial tomorrow!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh...)
Leads back to Talk options




We found him







Phoenix:
Huh? Gourdy? Oh, we found him already.
Maya:
What!? I haven't seen any monsters yet!
Lotta:
Y-y'all for real!? Gourdy really exists!? Wait! I need proof! You get a photo!?



I have proof







Phoenix:
Of course I have proof.
Maya:
No fair, Nick! It was when I went to the bathroom, wasn't it!? That's when you made contact with Gourdy!
Lotta:
Enough jabbering already, let's see your proof!



Present Air Tank (after clearing "The flying air tank" Talk option in Gourd Lake - Public Beach)







Phoenix:

Maya:
Larry's air tank...?
Lotta:
What're y'all doing with an air tank?
Phoenix:
This... is Gourdy.
Lotta:
Umm... scuze me?
Maya:
Wh-what exactly are you saying, Nick?
Phoenix:
There's a stand near here... a hotdog stand. There's a giant inflatable samurai doll there. About a week ago, an idiot, who happens to be a friend of mine, tried to fill it. He used this air tank, and when the valve blew, the tank flew into the lake. Apparently, it made a pretty loud "bang" when it flew...
Lotta:
A "bang"...?
Phoenix:
The tank, along with the still deflated Samurai fell into the lake. At the same time... A couple was taking a photograph of the lake. This photo!
Maya:
Wait... So... you're saying that Gourdy... Is really the Steel Samurai!?
Lotta:
... ... Well, that's a fine way to ruin a gal's dreams.
Phoenix:
I'm sorry, Lotta.
Lotta:
Nah, it's okay, you win. I'll give you your info, like I promised.
Maya:
Poor Lotta...

I have no proof







Phoenix:
I don't have it yet, but my lawyer instincts tell me the proof is out there.

Gourdy doesn't exist

Lotta:
Y'all got some proof Gourdy don't exist!?
Phoenix:
The proof that Gourdy doesn't exist...



Is here







Phoenix:
Of course I have proof. No lawyer worth his badge would make a claim without proof to back it up. Here's the proof that Gourdy doesn't exist...

Yeah... the night of the murder. My camera clicked twice, you know.Maya:

Stove







Phoenix:
Looks like a kitchen unit. It's pretty clean. Funny, he doesn't look like the type who'd keep things tidy like that.
Maya:
You're forgetting, Nick... He's running a pasta shop, here!




Fish pictures







Phoenix:
Wow, there's lots of various fish in Gourd Lake, aren't there!
Maya:
...? Something's funny, Nick. All these fish are saltwater fish.




Fishing pole







Phoenix:
This fishing pole looks expensive.




Table







Maya:
Look, Nick, he has an electric blanket on his table! Looks warm! That's a great idea, we should do that at the office. We can sit down with our clients, snug and warm, and drink hot cocoa!
Phoenix:
And what, talk about murders?
Maya:
Aw, you're a party pooper, Nick!

Phoenix:

Then I heard this "bang!" So I looked outside. Then I heard another one. "Bang!" A little while later, this boat comes back. Then a young man walked by my window here. He was mutterin' something to himself, ayup.

Okay, we promise.

Gumshoe:
Huh...!? How'd you-- Hmm. That was supposed to be top secret.
Maya:
Do you know who that old man is, Detective?
Gumshoe:
... Actually... I don't. He's a bit of an odd bird... I haven't been able to get a straight answer out of him. I decided first that he wasn't persuasive enough to stand and testify as a witness. That's why we called Ms. Lotta Hart yesterday. As for who he is... We have absolutely no idea.

Hmm... sounds suspicious!
Gumshoe:
Hmm...




The DL-6 Incident







Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe, please, help us...
Gumshoe:
H-huh?
Phoenix:
We need to know about the DL-6 Incident!
Gumshoe:
...!
Phoenix:
That was when Edgeworth's father died. I can't help but think that it has something to do with this current case.
Gumshoe:
... To tell the truth, I don't know much about DL-6 either. Mr. Edgeworth forbade us from reading the file. So... I'm afraid I can't show them to you, either, pal.

What!?
Gumshoe:
However... If you can convince me somehow that the DL-6 Incident is related to this case... Well, I guess I'd consider opening the file up.Present

Glass case







Phoenix:
It looks like there are files inside that glass case. The case is so dusty I can't see what's inside.
Maya:
Nick... it's locked.
Phoenix:
They must keep important case files in there.




Back wall







Phoenix:
There are shelves stuffed with case files in the back of the room, too. Forgotten cases, rotting away for eternity...
Maya:
Nick, let's get what we need and get out of here. All this dust is getting to me!




Cabinet







Phoenix:
This cabinet is where they keep evidence for current cases. Some of the things are obviously murder weapons. Others are... who knows what. Most of it just looks like random junk.
Maya:
Nick... what do you think this clothespin is for?
Phoenix:
Don't touch that! It's evidence...




Shelves







Phoenix:
Here are files of collected case reports. There's quite a large volume of reports here.
Maya:
Wow... these are all case reports!?
Phoenix:
Yeah. It's like a graveyard of police cases.

The case summary







Phoenix:
Well, first I have to get a handle on the main facts... like a summary.
Maya:
Right. Summary... summary... Found it! Here you go.
Phoenix:
December 28... 2001.
Maya:
That's exactly 15 years ago from the day after tomorrow!
Phoenix:
(So in two days, the case is closed...) The incident took place in the elevator of the district courthouse. (Changed from [The incident took place in the elevator of the district court.] in the original release)
Maya:
What!? Is this the same district courthouse where we're holding the trial now!? (Changed from [Is this the same district court where we're holding the trial now!?] in the original release)
Phoenix:
Looks like it. There was a large earthquake at 2:00 PM on that day. Part of the court building collapsed, and all of the lights went out.
Maya:
Wow... that was some earthquake!
Phoenix:
At the time, three people were trapped in the elevator. It took five hours for them to be rescued... Five hours!
Maya:
That would be scary like that, in the dark!
Phoenix:
There was a lack of oxygen in the elevator, and the survivors were unconscious.
Maya:
The survivors...?
Phoenix:
One of the three in the elevator had been shot... in the heart.
Maya:
That was Mr. Edgeworth's father... wasn't it.
Phoenix:
(He said that his father was shot before his very eyes... So Miles Edgeworth was one of the other passengers in that elevator.)




Victim data







Phoenix:
Do you have data on the victim... Edgeworth's father?
Maya:
Yeah, hold on... Victim... victim... Here! Found it!
Phoenix:
Gregory Edgeworth, 35, defense attorney. If he were still alive, he'd be 50. He had lost that day's case in court, and got in the elevator with his son, Miles.
Maya:
"Miles"...!
Phoenix:
Miles Edgeworth, of course.
Maya:
So he was on the elevator with his father!
Phoenix:
From the angle of the bullet and the other evidence, it could not have been a suicide... The murder weapon, a pistol, was found in the elevator. The pistol had been fired two times. (Where have I heard that before...? Huh...! It sounds just like this current case! What's going on here?)




Suspect data







Phoenix:
Got any data on the suspect in there?
Maya:
Hmm... that would be the guy that my mom got arrested. Hold on... this is it.
Phoenix:
The man arrested as a suspect in DL-6 was... Yanni Yogi? He was a clerk in the court, apparently.
Maya:
So he must have been the third person in the elevator. Well, then he had to have done it!
Phoenix:
But... he was found innocent. Thanks to his defense lawyer, Robert Hammond.
Maya:
Hammond... the victim in our case!
Phoenix:
Right. The suspect, Mr. Yogi was oxygen deprived... so much so he had brain damage. He lost all memory of being in the elevator. After he was declared innocent, he disappeared.
Maya:
Hmm... where could Yogi have gone to, I wonder?
Phoenix:
(He may be closer than we think...)Present









Anything







Maya:
Let's just hurry up and read these files! This place is so dusty, I want to finish up and get out of here...After clearing all Talk options:Phoenix:
I guess I know generally what happened in DL-6 now. I still don't know what sort of impact the whole thing had on Edgeworth...Maya:
Nick. Are we going to take the whole file? There's too much! We'll never get it out.Phoenix:
Y-you're right. How about we just take what we think we'll need...DL-6 Case File added to the Court Record.Phoenix:
Right. That's probably all we'll be able to find here. Now, all that's left is the trial tomorrow... I wonder how "Dad" will do testifying in court...To be continued.Nothing to examine during investigation







Phoenix:
No clues here.Turnabout Goodbyes

Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Miles Edgeworth.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.Karma:
... ...Judge:
Very well, apparently the prosecution is also ready.Phoenix:
(Who is the judge here, anyway!?)Judge:
Mr. von Karma, your opening statement.Karma:
... ...Judge:
Er... very well, no opening statement so...Karma:Karma:
Not so fast, Judge! I was taking a meaningful pause before speaking!Judge:
R-right, of course.Karma:
A prediction! Today's trial will end three minutes from now!Judge:
Order... order! Mr. von Karma! What is the meaning of your statement just now!?Karma:Karma:
Bah! Must you question everything! It will be over in three minutes! We have no time to waste! I'll call my witness now!Judge:
R-right...Karma:
I call my witness... my decisive witness to the stand!Phoenix:
(It's that mysterious boat shop owner.)Karma:
Witness... state your profession.Uncle:
Mmph... zzzz... ... I, er, am the proprietor of the restaurant the "Wet Noodle" at Gourd Lake.Karma:
...Uncle:
And I, er, also rent boats.Karma:
The night of the incident, you were in the boat rental shop, correct?Uncle:
Er... ayup, yup I was.Karma:
Please testify.Phoenix:
(Wait a second... We still haven't heard who this old guy is!)Raise an objection







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Wait a minute!"Let it slide







Phoenix:
(On second thought, I guess it doesn't really matter.)
Maya:
Doesn't matter!? What are you thinking, Nick!? What if that old man had something to do with the DL-6 Incident? If we don't find out who he is, we won't be able to build a case here!
Phoenix:
(Hmm, she has a point.)
Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Wait a minute!"Phoenix:
Wait a minute! The witness hasn't stated his name yet!Karma:Karma:
Because I did not ask him, Mr. Wright! Bah! I have predicted this trial will end in three minutes! Stop asking trivial questions and cooperate!Phoenix:
(Yeah, right!)Judge:
The witness will state his name.Uncle:
Zzzz... ... Mmph! Well, er... I'm not really sure, ayup.Judge:
What do you mean?Uncle:
My, er, memory...Karma:
Your Honor... The witness does not remember anything beyond the last several years... Ergo, he cannot recall his own name.Judge:
Hmm... he can't recall, you say?Karma:
Yes, but the incident in question took place three days ago. He can testify.Judge:
Very well. Let's hear his testimony then, shall we. Witness?Witness Testimony-- The Night of the Murder --Uncle:
It was the night of the 24th, just after midnight, ayup.
I was in the restaurant... where I er... rent boats, as usual.
Then I heard a "bang!" Ayup.
When I looked out the window, I saw a boat just a' floating on the lake.
Then I heard another "bang."
Just about then the boat comes back to the shore, and a man walks by my window.Judge:
Hmm...Very well. I'd like to begin the cross-examination...Karma:Karma:
There is nothing to question in my witness's testimony! Ergo, no need for cross-examination! Besides, there are only 10 seconds left before our three minutes are up! Judge! Your verdict, now!Judge:
Er... yes... M-Mr. Wright...?Cross-examine







Phoenix:
What are you saying!? Of course I'll cross-examine the witness!
Judge:
Hmm... Very well, you may begin.
Leads to:
"Raaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!"Don't cross-examine







Phoenix:
(He's right. That testimony sounded pretty solid. Maybe I should hold back.)
Maya:
B-but, Nick! You have to cross-examine him! This is your only chance to turn this trial around! Your last chance!
Phoenix:
(O-oh... right.)
Leads to:
"Raaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!"Karma:
Raaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!Judge:
E-excuse me? Mr. von Karma?Karma:
Three minutes just passed.Judge:
I see. Well then, let's just take our time. You may cross-examine the witness.Cross Examination-- The Night of the Murder --Uncle:
It was the night of the 24th, just after midnight, ayup.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
"Just after midnight," you say?
Uncle:
Ayup, just around then.
Phoenix:
Are you sure?
Uncle:
Pretty sure, ayup.
Phoenix:
When I talked to you yesterday, you were rather vague about the time... I'm surprised you seem so sure about it today.
Uncle:
...
Karma:

Karma:
I asked him, and he remembered. Isn't that right!?
Uncle:
Zzzz... D-don't glare at me like that...! I, er... I remembered it clearly, I did. Ayup.
Karma:
You see? Continue!Uncle:
I was in the restaurant... where I er... rent boats, as usual.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Is there anyone who can verify that?
Uncle:
... Well, I guess Polly could.
Phoenix:
Th-that's not good enough for a court of law!
Judge:
Mr. Wright... exactly what's not good enough?
Phoenix:
Ah, uh, Your Honor, this "Polly" is a parrot.
Judge:
A... parrot?
Uncle:
Don't be so hard on the girl, Keithy-boy!
Judge:
Keith...?
Karma:

Karma:
The prosecution concedes that we cannot prove the witness was in the shop. Witness... please continue.Uncle:
Then I heard a "bang!" Ayup.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
And where did the "bang" seem to come from?
Uncle:
From the lake, I figure.
Karma:
Are you certain?
Uncle:
A-ayup.
Karma:
Good. Continue!Uncle:
When I looked out the window, I saw a boat just a' floating on the lake.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Was there someone in the boat?
Uncle:
It was pretty far out there... I couldn't see clearly... But I figure there was two men out there, ayup.
Phoenix:
But you couldn't see them clearly!
Uncle:
Ayup... at the time, that is.
Phoenix:
(At the time...?)Uncle:
Then I heard another "bang."Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So you heard two gunshots total?
Uncle:
Ayup.
Phoenix:
(That's what Lotta said in her testimony yesterday.)Uncle:
Just about then the boat comes back to the shore, and a man walks by my window.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
"By your window"?
Uncle:
Ayup, by my window. Right outside the window of my little shack.
Phoenix:
And, could you see the man's face?
Uncle:
Well, the fog was pretty darn thick, but he was right there in front of me. I saw him.
Judge:
This is rather important detail! Please add it to your testimony.
Uncle:
...
Karma:
Tsk, tsk, tsk...
Phoenix:
(I have a bad feeling about this...)
Adds statement "That man was the defendant... he was saying "I can't believe he's dead."Uncle:
That man was the defendant... he was saying "I can't believe he's dead."Press







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"A-are you sure!?"Phoenix:
(If I know von Karma, he spent time preparing his witness. I'm not going to find contradictions very easily in this testimony. Whew... it's tough being a lawyer.)Phoenix:
A-are you sure!?Uncle:
...Phoenix:
(Uh oh!) D-Dad!Uncle:
Dead certain, Keith! He said "I can't believe he's dead" as he was walking by, too.Karma:
Witness! Are you sure that the person you saw was Miles Edgeworth!?Uncle:
It was him! That Edgeworth boy!Judge:
... This... sounds like decisive evidence indeed. I see no room for doubt.Phoenix:
(von Karma... He lured me into cross-examining so he could set me up for a fall!)Karma:
Tsk, tsk, tsk...Maya:
N-Nick...! I don't like the way things are going here! Everyone in the courtroom is glaring at us!Phoenix:
(I'd better act quick, or this trial is going to be over!)Raise an objection







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Your Honor! We proved in yesterday's court that it could not have been Edgeworth who fired the gun!
Karma:

Karma:
Mr. Wright. Are you referring to the fingerprints from Edgeworth's right hand found on the gun, and the photograph showing a man firing with his left hand...?
Phoenix:
Exactly!
Karma:
That is easily explainable! He could have wiped his prints after he fired! You are ignoring the truth of the matter here! Everything in this witness's testimony is true!
Leads to:
"Hmm..."Wait and see what happens







Phoenix:
(But... how can I raise an objection without any proof?)
Karma:
Judge! There is no room for doubt in the witness's testimony! I demand that you declare your verdict!
Leads to:
"Hmm..."Judge:
Hmm...Phoenix:
(The judge is lost in thought... what should I do?)Raise an objection







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Your Honor! This witness claims that Edgeworth said "I can' t believe he's dead"... But his word is all we have! If he were telling a lie...
Karma:

Karma:
Mr. Wright. In a court of law, the evidence tells all. Apparently, you have yet to realize even this basic fact. If you say his testimony is a lie, show us proof!
Phoenix:
Urk...
Maya:
Nick! Do we have evidence...?
Leads to:
"It's no good! There's nothing I can do."Wait and see what happens







Phoenix:
(I can't see any room to raise an objection... I'd better hold back and see how things develop.)
Maya:
Nick! We have to do something! If we stay quiet now, Mr. Edgeworth'll be found guilty for sure!
Leads to:
"It's no good! There's nothing I can do."Phoenix:
It's no good! There's nothing I can do.Maya:
A... are you sure?Phoenix:
To be honest... I don't know what to do anymore.Maya:
Please... Can you hear me, Sis? Please... We need your help... Nick needs you...Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... Three minutes was perhaps too high an expectation. However, fifteen minutes isn't bad! This must be a new record.Judge:
Enough! The witness may leave the stand.Uncle:
Zzzz...Judge:
This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts.Phoenix:
(W-what!? No!)Karma:
Hmph.Judge:
This court find the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth...GuiltyJudge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!W-w-waaaaaaait!Judge:
Wh-who was that just now?Me!!!Phoenix:
Huh? Waaaaah! L-Larry!Judge:
Wh-what are you doing here!?Butz:
Listen! Y-you gotta listen to me! I... I was...  I was there, in the park, the night of the murder! I... I wasn't sure about it until just yesterday. B-but today I remembered it!Judge:
Remembered what?Butz:
The gunshot! I heard it too!Judge:
O-order!Karma:Karma:
What is the meaning of this!? The verdict has been decided! I call for adjournment!Judge:
One moment, Mr. von Karma. So, you say you heard a gunshot?Butz:
Yeah, I did! A gunshot! That night! I was sitting here in the audience, listening to the testimony... Then I realized, something he said was different from what I remember! A-anyhow, I can't just sit here and let you call Edgey a murderer! It's... It's just not right! I'll testify! Lemme testify!Judge:
Order! Order! Well, this is the first time something has happened like this in my court. I'm not quite sure how to proceed...Karma:
Judge! You've already given your decision! The trial is over!Maya:
Nick! This is it! Larry's given us one final chance at this!Phoenix:
(She's right! If only it wasn't Larry... He could make things even worse...)Maya:
Mr. Edgeworth was just declared guilty, Nick! It doesn't get any worse!Phoenix:
You're right! Okay! Your Honor! If there is another witness, it is our duty to hear him speak! Right here! Right now!Karma:
A waste of time! The verdict cannot be overturned!Judge:
Hmm... ... ... Allow me to speak my opinion. In all court proceedings, it is our duty to prevent an inaccurate verdict. In order to make sure no mistake has been made, every witness should be heard!Karma:
Wh-what is this!?Judge:
I withdraw my previous verdict of "guilty"! Mr. von Karma! I order you to call this new witness to testify. Now!Karma:
Whaaaat!Judge:
The court will adjourn for a five minute recess. After that, we will hear this new witness. Court is adjourned!December 27, 10:28 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2Phoenix:
Whew... That was too close. Sorry to keep you on the edge of your seat like that, Edgeworth.Edgeworth:
Hmph. I've seen worse.Phoenix:
(Yeah right, Edgeworth. You're sweating bullets!) I just wonder what Larry plans to say in there.Maya:
Larry was at the lake that night?Phoenix:
Yes... He said he went looking for the Steel Samurai balloon that flew into the lake.Maya:
Oh right. And he found the balloon and the air tank that night?Phoenix:
Yeah.Edgeworth:
...Phoenix:
Hey, Edgeworth.Edgeworth:
... Huh? You say something, Wright?Phoenix:
Yeah, a lot of things. You seem out of it. What's wrong?Edgeworth:
It... it's nothing.Phoenix:
Hmm?Maya:
Umm... Mr. Edgeworth? There's something I've been meaning to ask you.Edgeworth:
What's that?Maya:
Why are your fingerprints on the murder weapon?Edgeworth:
Oh. When he fell into the lake, I went into a daze. I couldn't understand what had happened. I couldn't think straight. Then I saw the pistol lying on the floor of the boat in front of me. I picked it up without thinking. I didn't have a reason, really.Maya:
I see...Edgeworth:
Wright...Phoenix:
Yeah?Edgeworth:
This might be our chance.Phoenix:
Our chance?Edgeworth:
von Karma has only ever run perfect trials.Phoenix:
Perfect trials...?Edgeworth:
Perfectly prepared witnesses, perfectly complete evidence. That's the secret to his success. This is the first time he's ever had to deal with something unexpected! He has to let someone he hasn't even talked to testify before the court! (Changed from [He has let someone he hasn't even talked to testify before the court!] in the original release) And that someone... is Larry!Phoenix:
What are you getting at?Edgeworth:
It's likely his testimony will be full of holes, Wright.Maya:
That's right, Nick! No ten minute trial this time! We'll milk this one for all it's worth!Phoenix:
Hey, it was fifteen minutes! Fifteen! (Everything's on Larry now...) (Changed from [Hey, it was fifteen minutes! Fifteen! (Everything depends on Larry now...)] in the original release)December 27, 10:35 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:
Court is now back in session. Witness... Please testify to the court about everything that you saw... on the night of December 24th.Butz:
Right... leave it to me!Phoenix:

That night, I was out in a boat on the lake.
I was looking for something and I, er, found it.
So I quietly slipped the boat back in at the rental shop dock.
Then, just as I was thinking about going home, I heard this "bang"!
I looked out over the lake, but I didn't notice the boat.
So after I heard that single gunshot I went home.Judge:
Hmm... That was an unusually vague testimony, even for this court. In any matter, Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor...Maya:
What's wrong, Nick?Phoenix:
It's Larry! I have no idea what he's going to say if I press him. I'm a little scared.Maya:
Hmm... Well, we've come this far. There's no way to go but forward, Nick!Cross Examination-- The Night of the Murder --Butz:

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
...
Judge:
Something wrong, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
There were so many things wrong I don't know where to begin...
Judge:
Ah...
Phoenix:
Um, well, okay. First of all, what time was it?
Butz:
Oh, it was after 11:00 when I went out in the boat. By that time everyone had gone home for the night. So I waited until the coast was clear, so to speak.
Phoenix:
And why were you out on a boat at such a late hour...?Butz:
I was looking for something and I, er, found it.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
"Looking for something"...?
Butz:
Er, yeah.
Judge:
Mr. Butz, what was it you were looking for?
Karma:

Karma:
What the witness was searching for is irrelevant! Most likely he was hunting for this "Gourdy"!
Phoenix:
(You know, it wouldn't surprise me one bit if that was the truth.)
Karma:
This is all irrelevant! Let's get it over with.Butz:
So I quietly slipped the boat back in at the rental shop dock.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Around what time was that?
Butz:
Uh... Well, let's see... I figured I was out searching for about an hour... I guess it was around 12:00. Yeah.
Judge:
You're not sure?
Butz:
Hey! Don't give me that face! I'm not some sort of human sundial, okay!?
Phoenix:
(People use watches these days, Larry...)Butz:
Then, just as I was thinking about going home, I heard this "bang"!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Where did the sound come from?
Butz:
Yeah, well, I wasn't too sure about that. I looked around, y'know.
Judge:
Did you look at the lake?
Butz:
Yeah, I looked.Butz:
I looked out over the lake, but I didn't notice the boat.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Wasn't there a boat on the lake!?
Judge:
Order! Order! Well? Mr. Butz!
Butz:
Whoa, whoa. Everybody just calm down, okay? I mean, it was real foggy that night. I'm not sure whether there was a boat out there or not.
Phoenix:
(Oh, okay, no problem. That's just the MOST IMPORTANT PART of the case!!!)
Karma:
Hmph!Butz:
So after I heard that single gunshot I went home.Press







Phoenix:

So, you only heard one "bang" correct?
Butz:
Yeah.
Phoenix:
(Huh.)Present Lotta's Deposition







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"W-wait a sec, Larry!"Maya:
Well, Nick?Phoenix:
Hmm... It was a pretty wishy-washy testimony, wasn't it? I guess I should just start working on the contradictions.Maya:
Sorry...
I wish I could be more helpful. I wish I could call my sister...Phoenix:
W-wait a sec, Larry!Butz:
Wh-what!?Phoenix:
You only heard one "bang"!? You're sure!?Butz:
That's what I said!Phoenix:
But Mr. Lotta Hart testified yesterday that she heard two "bang"s! And the old man just now said the same thing! They both heard two gunshots that night!Butz:
Huh?Phoenix:
Were you even listening!? Were you paying attention at all to what they said?Butz:
Yo, Nick, please!Phoenix:
Huh?Butz:
You know, something's been bothering me. I'm a witness, see? I'm like a customer here! So you got to treat me nice and stuff, okay!?Phoenix:
...Judge:
Mr. Butz.Butz:
What!?Judge:
You only heard one gunshot? Are you sure?Butz:
... Umm... Well, to tell ya the truth... I'm not sure.Judge:
Eh...?Phoenix:
Not sure!? H-how could you not be sure?Butz:
Yeah, well... I, uh, I might have missed the other gunshot. I was, uh, listening to something else...Phoenix:
Something... else?Butz:
My radio, dude! With my headphones. (Changed from [My radio, dude! On my headphones.] in the original release)Phoenix:
Whaaaaaaat!?Judge:
Order! Order! And stop that booing! M-Mr. Butz! You were listening to the radio with your headphones? (Changed from [You were listening to a radio on earphones?] in the original release)Butz:
Y-yeah! So what! That a crime!? I listen to my radio! Everybody listens to the radio! What's the big deal!?Judge:
Hmm... Mr. von Karma... your opinion?Karma:
Waste of time. I do not accept this witness, nor his shoddy testimony.Judge:
Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright? Should he continue the testimony?That's enough







Phoenix:
(No, I think I've heard enough. This is all too embarrassing... In fact, I think we've all heard enough.)
Maya:
What are you saying, Nick!? If you stop now, Mr. Edgeworth will be found guilty! We have to turn this trial around now!
Phoenix:
Uh...

Leads to:
"Your Honor."Phoenix:
Your Honor. Please... please allow the witness to continue his testimony.Karma:
Bah! Nothing is more pitiful than a lawyer who doesn't know when he's lost!Judge:
Very well, Mr. Butz. Please give your testimony, and be sure to include details like your RADIO.Butz:
Right! Leave it to me!Phoenix:
(I wouldn't if there were any other way out of this, believe me.)Witness Testimony-- What Larry Heard --Butz:
It's lonely, being alone on Christmas Eve!
That's why I was listening to an all-requests show on the radio, see?
I was listening to it real booming loud, like.
But I'm sure I heard that gunshot!
I remember exactly what the DJ was saying when I heard it, too.Judge:
You were listening to your radio... at a high volume!?Butz:
Yeah, what's the big problem? Can't a man listen to his radio in peace? Isn't this a free country!?Phoenix:
(I truly believe Larry has no idea what the problem here is.)Karma:
Judge. Can you believe a word this witness says? What he heard was probably nothing more than a drum beat from the radio!Judge:
True enough, it is difficult to believe this testimony.Phoenix:Phoenix:
Wait, Your Honor! The witness said he remembers exactly what the DJ said when he heard the gunshot!Judge:
Excuse me? "Dee-jay"...?Phoenix:
An announcer... the guy who says things on the radio. Anyway! What this means is, when he heard the sound, no music was playing! The DJ only talks between songs! So he could have heard the gunshot from the lake! I'd like to cross-examine the witness, Your Honor!Judge:
V-very well, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:

Dare I ask why?Maya:\nDuh, Nick! Isn\'t it obvious? I need a waterfall to stand under! Preferably a freezing one!Phoenix:\n... Oh... Is that part of your spirit medium training?Maya:\nOf course! Except, I\'ve been slacking off lately... I need to brave the elements and be forged anew under the rushing spring waters!Phoenix:\nUmm... Okay... I don\'t know about any falls per se, but Gourd Lake is pretty close...Maya:\nOh. Darn.Phoenix:\nSorry, but them\'s the breaks. Couldn\'t you just take a cold shower or something?Maya:\n... Good idea!Phoenix:\n(So much for the rushing spring waters...)TV:\nNext in the news... A large, unidentified animal was sighted at Gourd Lake! The town is buzzing with excitement! Locals are calling it "Gourdy" in a tip of the hat to Nessie, the Loch Ness monster. Though its namesake, Nessie, proved to be a hoax... locals are confident their Gourdy is the real deal. ...Phoenix:\n*yawn* Bor-ing. Can\'t they show real news for a change?Maya:\nNick?Phoenix:\n?Maya:\nThe water pressure\'s kind of low in that shower.Phoenix:\n... You want more pressure, huh? Why don\'t you go down to the fire department and have them spray you with the hose?Maya:\n... Good idea, Nick!Phoenix:\n(Apparently, Fey blood is no aid in detecting sarcasm...)

Strange occurrences continue at Gourd Lake... But this time, it\'s murder!Phoenix:\n(Gourd Lake again?)TV:\nThe body of a man was found in the lake early this morning. A suspect was apprehended. Sources inside the police department revealed... that the suspect\'s name is Miles Edgeworth, age 24. Edgeworth was an up-and-coming prosecution attorney, known for his skill and connections. He was guaranteed a long and rewarding career... Has he thrown it all away?Phoenix:\n(...? E-Edgeworth!?) What\'s going on!? Edgeworth would never do something like--Maya:\nNick?Phoenix:\nYipes! M-Maya!Maya:\nThe fireman yelled at me when I called him.Phoenix:\nWe\'ve got bigger things to worry about than that! They arrested Edgeworth!Maya:\nWhat? You mean, the prosecutor?Phoenix:\nYeah, he\'s a suspect... in a murder!Maya:\nWhaaaaat!? When? Where? Whom? Why?

Its name is "Charley." Maya\'s gotten the knack of watering it lately. Charley\'s been perking up these days.\n\n\n\n\nDesk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMia\'s desk.

Lately, I\'ve been spending more time on the couch, watching TV.\n\n\n\n\nMovie poster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMaya brought in a poster of the Steel Samurai the other day.

Let\'s investigate! We should talk to Mr. Edgeworth, and check out the crime scene!\nPhoenix:\n(You\'re right... We need more information! Save aimlessness and confusion for later!)\n\n\n\n\nAny ideas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell? Got any good ideas?\nMaya:\nNot really.

Hey! Edgeworth! Come back!Edgeworth:\nWhat are you doing here!?Maya:\nNick, I don\'t think he\'s in a very good mood.Phoenix:\nWell, he is in detention. Were you in a good mood when you were here?Edgeworth:\nSo, you\'ve come to laugh at the fallen attorney? Then laugh, laugh! Well? Why aren\'t you laughing?Maya:\nNick... Should we be laughing?Phoenix:\nNah. It\'s a trick. Laugh and he\'ll get mad... or burst into tears. Edgeworth. We don\'t have so much free time we can spend it coming down here to laugh at you.Edgeworth:\n... Yes you do.Phoenix:\n(Actually, he\'s right.)Edgeworth:\n... I hoped you wouldn\'t come.

Don\'t be ridiculous.\nPhoenix:\nSorry...?\nEdgeworth:\nYou\'re a novice! You\'ve only been in three trials!\nPhoenix:\nH-hey!\nEdgeworth:\nSure, you got lucky and won all three...

Gourdy.\nMaya:\nHuh?\nEdgeworth:\nI went to see Gourdy.\nMaya:\n"Gourdy"? What\'s that!?\nPhoenix:\nI\'ll... tell you later. (Why won\'t Edgeworth talk to us?)\n\n\n\n\nDid you do it (appears after "What happened", "Gourd Lake", and presenting Attorney\'s Badge)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth... this is really hard for me to ask... But... you didn\'t do it, right? Right?\nEdgeworth:\n... Think what you will. I have only one request.\nPhoenix:\nHuh?\nEdgeworth:\nStay out of this case.\nMaya:\nWhy!? B-but Nick is trying to help you!\nEdgeworth:\nI know...! I know that! But I don\'t want your help, okay?\nMaya:\n\n\n\nWhy not?\nEdgeworth:\n... Look, just go away, and leave me alone!\nMaya:\nNick... Mr. Edgeworth did it, didn\'t he.\nPhoenix:\nMaya! Let\'s go investigate elsewhere.\nMaya:\nBut, Nick...Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney\'s Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth:\nYour attorney\'s badge...?\nPhoenix:\nEdgeworth. Let me defend you.\nEdgeworth:\n... Hah! Hah hah! Good one, Wright. But I\'m not that hard up. Not yet.\nMaya:\nWh-what do you mean by that?\nEdgeworth:\nMe? Trust a wet-behind-the-ears lawyer with only three trials under his belt? Never!\nMaya:\nWh-what!?\nEdgeworth:\nMy case is near hopeless, Wright. Every defense attorney I\'ve talked to has turned me down.\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nEdgeworth:\nSimply put, they were afraid they\'d lose. It occurred to me that it might be my fault that they lack confidence. After all, I did get every single one of their clients declared "guilty."\nPhoenix:\nI don\'t believe it!\nEdgeworth:\nRegardless, I don\'t want you involved in this. You in particular I cannot ask to do this.December 25Gourd Lake ParkEntranceMaya:\nThis is where it happened?Phoenix:\nYeah. Gourd Lake is in the middle of this park.Maya:\nI can see some police walking around in there.Phoenix:\nQuestioning people, probably.Maya:\nHey!

We need clues, on the double!Police:\nB-but, sir... There weren\'t any clues... that\'s why we arrested that attorney, Mr. Edgeworth! It\'s clear, sir. He\'s the one who--Gumshoe:\nShaddup! Just you try saying that again! I\'ll... I\'ll... I\'ll make you sorry if you do! (Changed from [I\'ll... er...

Investigating!?Phoenix:\nHuh? Um, well, yes. I suppose.Gumshoe:\nWell, I\'m here to help! Ask me anything you want! Bring it!Maya:\nHe seems different than usual. I wonder what\'s up? Umm... Mr. Edgeworth hasn\'t actually asked us to defend him yet...Gumshoe:\nHuh!? Oh? Y-you don\'t say...Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrees\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI feel winter\'s chill from the bare leaf trees today... *sigh* What is it about winter that turns people into poets?\nMaya:\nI don\'t know, but my toes are starting to feel numb.\nPhoenix:\n(Yes... my poetry has that effect on some people.)\n\n\n\n\nSign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe sign says "Gourd Lake Nature Park." This place is full of families picnicking on the weekend.\nMaya:\nBut... no waterfall.\nPhoenix:\nNot many picnickers come here for spiritual training, Maya.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe? Do you know what happened here?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? You don\'t know, pal?\nPhoenix:\nNo...\nGumshoe:\nWow, okay, Mr. Head-in-the-fluffy-pink-clouds Lawyer.\nPhoenix:\nHead-in-the... huh?\nGumshoe:\nNever mind, I\'ll tell you. It happened last night, about 15 minutes after midnight. There was a boat out on Gourd Lake. In that boat were two men. One of those men shot the other with a pistol.\nMaya:\nAnd... the shooter was Mr. Edgeworth?\nGumshoe:\nA cop who arrived on the scene arrested him.\nMaya:\nHow did they get there so fast? (Changed from [How did he get there so fast?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nWell... There was a witness. When the report came in, we raced to the lake.\nPhoenix:\nA witness?\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nYou don\'t think Mr. Edgeworth is a... murderer, do you!? (Changed from [You don\'t think Mr. Edgeworth is a... murderer!?] in the original release)\nGumshoe:\nAbsolutely not! It\'s impossible! I don\'t care if there\'s a witness either! I don\'t believe a lick of it!\nMaya:\nR-right! Who cares what the witness says!\nPhoenix:\n(I care!)\nMaya:\n... You really believe in him, don\'t you, Detective?\nGumshoe:\nCourse I do! But... the police are pretty sure he\'s the killer. Nobody\'s even really taking this investigation that seriously.\nMaya:\nOh no!\nGumshoe:\nAfter all the help Mr. Edgeworth has been to us... Hard to imagine that no one\'s standing up to take his side.\nMaya:\nWell, at least you are, Detective. At least you are.\n\n\n\n\nDefense request\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nDo you know who will be Mr. Edgeworth\'s defense attorney in tomorrow\'s trial?\nGumshoe:\nHe hasn\'t got one yet.\nMaya:\nWhat? The trial IS tomorrow, isn\'t it?\nGumshoe:\nWell, I don\'t know the whole story... But apparently no one he\'s been talking to will take his case.\nMaya:\nW-why not?\nGumshoe:\nMr. Edgeworth won\'t tell me! When you guys showed up, I figured he\'d asked you to defend him.\nPhoenix:\nU-unfortunately not...\nGumshoe:\nWell, pal, then you got a job to do! Help out Mr. Edgeworth! Prove that badge you wear isn\'t just some fancy piece of metal! Prove it to me, pal! Show me you\'re an attorney!\n\n\n\n\nDefense request (after presenting Attorney\'s Badge in Detention Center - Visitor\'s Room)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nI-is it true? No one will take Mr. Edgeworth\'s case?\nGumshoe:\nYeah... He\'s a bit of a celebrity. If you defended him, and lost, your reputation\'d be sure to suffer. What\'s more... The case against him is... well, it\'s pretty solid.\nPhoenix:\n(I suppose it would be if they have a witness.)\nGumshoe:\nHey! Pal! Don\'t tell me your going to turn your back on him too!? Remember the Steel Samurai case? (Changed from [Remember the Steel Samurai!] in the original release) Mr. Edgeworth helped you get your client declared innocent!\nPhoenix:\nI... I know. I went to Edgeworth. I tried. He really doesn\'t want us to represent him. Especially not us, he said.\nGumshoe:\nWhat!? W-well, that doesn\'t make any sense, pal! You should have heard him talking about you after that trial! (Changed from [You should have heard him talking about you after the Steel Samurai case!] in the original release) He kept saying "Wright, Wright, Wright," over and over.\nMaya:\n... Nick? I\'m not sure that\'s a good sign.\nPhoenix:\nNeither am I...\nGumshoe:\nWhy wouldn\'t he want your help? I don\'t get it.\n\n\n\n\nThe witness (appears after "What happened")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWho was this witness?\nGumshoe:\nEr, sorry, pal. That\'s confidential. Anyway, the witness saw everything, apparently. I\'m sure they\'ll turn up at the trial tomorrow.\nPhoenix:\nWas there only that one witness?\nGumshoe:\nYep. It was pretty cold out on the lake last night. And, it was Christmas Eve after all. Still, we\'re being thorough. You never know when you\'re going to turn up another witness. That\'s why we\'re here today, checking things out. So far, we\'re coming up empty...\nMaya:\nOh! It\'s Christmas today! I\'d forgotten. What are you getting me for Christmas, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nTalk to Santa.Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney\'s Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThat badge! You\'re showing that to the wrong guy, pal!

I was sure it was because the lake looked like a gourd when viewed from above! You know, like an hourglass shape?\nPhoenix:\nWell, it is shaped like a gourd, actually.

Yeah, his methods might be a little extreme at times. But... there\'s a reason! He trusts our investigation, see? He trusts us to get the right man! That\'s why I work extra hard, pal.

There was a murder here last night... And since you work here... Have you heard anything? (Changed from [You work here. Have you heard anything?] in the original release)\nMaya:\nNick, you\'re wasting your time. Last night was Christmas Eve! He was with Kiyance, obviously! He wouldn\'t have been standing out here in the cold!\nButz:\nOof!\nMaya:\n?\nPhoenix:\nI think what you just said caught him off guard, Maya.\nButz:\nN-no, it\'s just... Kiyance\'s not in town right now. She... she\'s in Hawaii on a photo shoot.\nPhoenix:\n(A model. I knew it.) Well, anyway, there was a murder here on the lake. The trial\'s tomorrow.\nButz:\nHuh. Neat.\nPhoenix:\nThe defendant is Edgeworth. Miles Edgeworth.\nMaya:\nUm, Nick? Why would Larry know Edgeworth...?\nButz:\nWhoa, Nick! You don\'t mean THAT Miles Edgeworth!? Old Edgey!?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. He\'s a murder suspect.\nButz:\nWh-whoa! Murder?\nMaya:\nHuh? You know Mr. Edgeworth, Larry?\nButz:\nYeah! Of course! Edgey was in the same class as us in grade school!\nMaya:\nWhaaaaaaaaat!?\n\n\n\n\nSamurai Dogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nUmm... umm... tell me about the dogs!\nButz:\nHuh? Oh, you mean the Samurai Dogs?\nMaya:\nW-why are they Samurai Dogs? I... I mean they kind of look gourd-shaped.\nButz:\nOh, well originally, they were Gourd Dogs! Y\'know, like "guard dogs"?\nMaya:\nOuch...\nButz:\nThe Samurai thing was Kiyance\'s idea. Oh, she\'s my woman, y\'know. She was all "change the name and you go girlfriend!" She made me that banner! Man, the kids can\'t get enough of those Samurai Dogs!\nMaya:\nErr... Something about that just seems... wrong.\nButz:\nOh, and guess what? We\'re getting a ton of customers here at the lake, what with the big news!\nMaya:\nThe "big news"...?\nButz:\nYeah! Gourdy!\nMaya:\nG-"Gourdy"...?\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth (appears after "What happened")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nSo, Mr. Edgeworth was your classmate, Larry?\nButz:\nYeah, Nick, him, and I used to hang out all the time.\nMaya:\nWow... I never knew.\nButz:\nDon\'t get me wrong. He\'s always been kind of a stick in the mud. Studying all the time, trying to "be like father."\nMaya:\nLike his father...?\nButz:\nYeah. Edgey\'s pop was a famous defense lawyer back in the day.\nMaya:\nWow. Wait... You said "defense lawyer"?\nButz:\nYeah.\nMaya:\nWait a second! But Mr. Edgeworth is a prosecuting attorney!\nButz:\nWhat? Edgey\'s got a proboscis on his knee!?\nMaya:\nNo, no--he\'s a "prosecuting attorney." That\'s like the total opposite of a defense lawyer!\nButz:\n... Huh. Go figure! He always used to talk about defending the "weak" who were "unable to defend themselves." Man, he used to go on and on about man\'s duty to society and all that. What a bore! I wonder what changed his mind, though? Do you know, Nick?\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nNick...?\n\n\n\n\nGourdy (appears after "Samurai Dogs")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nUmm... what\'s "Gourdy"?\nButz:\nHuh? You mean you don\'t know?

It\'s r-really real! Nick! A monster! A real monster!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... yeah. (It\'s probably just a log or something... right?) Hey... there\'s a quote here from the person who took the photo. Hmm? What\'s this? "I set the camera to automatic, and when we got into the frame... I heard a loud \'bang\'! Like an explosion... followed by the sound of something slipping into the water..."\nMaya:\nI wish I could have seen it!\nPhoenix:\n(Why would there be a sound like an explosion...?) Larry.

Right before my eyes... He was shot and killed, and I saw it all.\nMaya:\n...!\nEdgeworth:\nMy memories from that time are... foggy. I suppose it\'s a self-defense mechanism. In any case, a suspect was arrested... a man. It\'s pretty clear he was the only one who could have killed my father. The spirit medium they used to talk to my late father said the same thing. It was an attorney by the name of Robert Hammond that cleared the suspect\'s name.\nPhoenix:\nAnd Hammond... is the victim in the Gourd Lake murder?\nEdgeworth:\nCorrect.\nMaya:\nUmm...

The one who got off innocent?\nEdgeworth:\nI don\'t know... He disappeared from public view. Nobody knows where to. If he\'s still alive, he\'d be about 50 years old now.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess I can understand why he\'d go into hiding... It\'d be hard to live a normal life after being a murder suspect in such a big case.)\n\n\n\n\nYour father (appears after "The DL-6 Incident")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nUmm... so, was your father a lawyer?\nEdgeworth:\nHe was...

Once you start on something, you always see it through, don\'t you?\nPhoenix:\nAbout the "DL-6 Incident"...\nEdgeworth:\nRight... DL-6. I didn\'t want you to find out about it. That is why I refused your offer to defend me. I\'m sorry if it sounded like I thought you weren\'t up to the job. I just wanted to keep you away from DL-6.\nPhoenix:\nSo... do you still think it would have been better for me to stay away?\nEdgeworth:\nI don\'t know. But...

He\'s as ruthless as me, times twenty!Maya:\nThat\'s pretty ruthless...Edgeworth:\nLike I said. He\'s a god among prosecutors.Phoenix:\n(I guess that\'s something like Mia was to me. Speaking of Mia...) Um, Maya?Maya:\nUh huh?Phoenix:\nWe could really be using Mia\'s help right now... don\'t you think?Maya:\nOh...Phoenix:\n?Maya:\nI can\'t. Sorry. I tried, I really tried, but I couldn\'t reach.Phoenix:\nYou couldn\'t "reach"?Maya:\nI think it\'s because I haven\'t been training. My powers are weak again...Phoenix:\nOh man, what bad timing!Maya:\nI\'m really sorry. I\'ll try my best!Phoenix:\nI hope so!Edgeworth:\nWhat are you whispering about?Phoenix:\nO-oh, it\'s nothing. Well, it\'s time. Let\'s head in...December 26, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Miles Edgeworth.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Karma:\n...Judge:\nErr, Mr. von Karma? Is the prosecution ready?Karma:\n... Fool... You seriously think that I would stand here were I not completely prepared?Judge:\nR-right, my apologies!Phoenix:\n(He\'s even got the Judge scared!)Judge:\nVery well, your opening statement, please.Karma:\n... Decisive evidence... A decisive witness... What else could possibly be required?Judge:\nAh... er, nothing of course. That should be fine. The prosecution may call its first witness.Maya:\nWhat\'s with this guy? Is he royalty or something?Phoenix:\nHow am I supposed to fight against this!?Karma:\nI call the detective in charge of this case, Detective Dick Gumshoe.Phoenix:\n(Okay, Gumshoe\'s first... Let\'s see how this goes.)Karma:\nDescribe the incident. Now!Gumshoe:\nY-yessir!Phoenix:\n(Detective Gumshoe looks nervous...)Gumshoe:\nEr, please take a look at the map. The murder happened late Christmas Eve, around midnight. There was one boat in the very middle of the lake. There were two men on the boat. Now, there happened to be a woman camping here on the edge of the lake. At 12:10 AM, she heard two pistol shots. Then the boat started to move. It went towards the boat rental shop.Karma:\nHmm.Overhead Map added to the Court Record.Karma:\nTestify to the court about your arrest. Now!Judge:\nW-w-wait! Mr. von Karma...Karma:\nYes?Judge:\nActually, I\'m the one that\'s supposed to be handling these proceedings...Karma:\nWrong. There is only one thing you need to do here. You will slam down your gavel and say the word "guilty." That is your role!Judge:\nY-yes, of course. You\'re quite right.Phoenix:\n(No, he\'s not!!!)Witness Testimony-- The Arrest of Edgeworth --Gumshoe:\nA man called into the station around 30 minutes after midnight.\nWe headed to the scene of the crime as fast as we could.\nThat\'s where we found Mr. Edgeworth.\nNow, I didn\'t suspect him of anything at all.\nBut... the next morning, a body was found in the lake.\nSo we had to arrest Mr. Edgeworth.Judge:\nHmm... I see. Very well...Karma:\nBegin your cross-examination, attorney. Now!Judge:\n...Cross Examination-- The Arrest of Edgeworth --Gumshoe:\nA man called into the station around 30 minutes after midnight.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou received a call from a "man"?\nGumshoe:\nEr... yup.\nPhoenix:\nBut you said there was a woman camping there? She was the one who heard the two gunshots, right?\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nThat woman and the "man" who called in the report are two different people, obviously!\nPhoenix:\nDifferent people?\nKarma:\nThere were two witnesses!\nPhoenix:\n(Urk!)\nKarma:\nTheir testimonies were quite similar however. Today I\'ve summoned the woman who was camping.\nPhoenix:\n(The woman who was camping... Lotta Hart.)\nKarma:\nWhat happened next, Detective?Gumshoe:\nWe headed to the scene of the crime as fast as we could.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow long was it between receiving the report and your arrival at the lake?\nGumshoe:\nEr, well... I\'d say it was about three minutes.\nPhoenix:\nThat\'s pretty fast!\nGumshoe:\nOur motto for the month is "get there quick."\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nDetective! You will refrain from casually revealing department secrets!\nGumshoe:\nY-yessir! Sorry, sir!\nKarma:\nDo that, and you\'ll be able to look forward to your next salary review.\nGumshoe:\nSo much to look forward to, these days...\nKarma:\nThis is no time for daydreaming! Continue!\nGumshoe:\nY-yessir!Gumshoe:\nThat\'s where we found Mr. Edgeworth.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat was Mr. Edgeworth like when you saw him then?\nGumshoe:\nWell... From what I saw, he looked pretty relaxed. Not like a murderer at all, really.\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nDetective! The court requires the facts, NOT your opinion! How many years have you been on the force!? Facts only, Detective! Hard, cold, objective facts!\nGumshoe:\nY-y-yessir!\nPhoenix:\n(Man, he\'s got his share of objections...)Gumshoe:\nNow, I didn\'t suspect him of anything at all.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy didn\'t you think he was suspicious?\nGumshoe:\nYou should know! We have a deep, trusting relationship with the prosecutors.\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nDetective! The court isn\'t interested in your musings! "Deep"? "Trusting"? Poppycock! I\'ve never heard so many flippant comments from an active detective on the force!\nGumshoe:\nMmph!\nPhoenix:\n(Detective Gumshoe doesn\'t look so good...)\nKarma:\nContinue! Now!Gumshoe:\nBut... the next morning, a body was found in the lake.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid you find any clues on the body?\nGumshoe:\nA single bullet was recovered from the body. He was shot through the heart... fatally.\nKarma:\nJudge! Here\'s the bullet... It didn\'t strike bone, so its shape is well preserved.\nJudge:\nVery well. The court accepts this bullet into evidence.\nPistol Bullet added to the Court Record.Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nDid you find any clues on the body?\nGumshoe:\nA single bullet was recovered from the body. He was shot through the heart... fatally.Gumshoe:\nSo we had to arrest Mr. Edgeworth.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nW-why is that?\nGumshoe:\nWell, we found the murder weapon in the boat.\nPhoenix:\nThe murder weapon...?\nGumshoe:\nA pistol.\nJudge:\nDetective Gumshoe... That is a vital piece of information. Please revise your testimony.\nGumshoe:\nRight! S-sorry, Your Honor.\nChanges statement from "So we had to arrest Mr. Edgeworth." to "The murder weapon we found in the boat was decisive evidence."Gumshoe:\nThe murder weapon we found in the boat was decisive evidence.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat about the pistol made it "decisive evidence"?\nKarma:\nTsk tsk tsk...\nPhoenix:\n(Ack! He has the same evil laugh as Edgeworth...)\nGumshoe:\nThere were fingerprints on the pistol found in the boat. They were clear prints from Mr. Edgeworth\'s right hand.\nPhoenix:\nWh-what!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! So Mr. Edgeworth\'s fingerprints were found on the murder weapon!?\nGumshoe:\nY-yes, Your Honor.\nKarma:\nJudge! This is the weapon in question.\nJudge:\nA-accepted into evidence.\nPistol added to the Court Record.Press (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat about the pistol made it "decisive evidence"?\nKarma:\nTsk tsk tsk...\nPhoenix:\n(Ack! He has the same evil laugh as Edgeworth...)\nGumshoe:\nThere were fingerprints on the pistol found in the boat. They were clear prints from Mr. Edgeworth\'s right hand.\nPhoenix:\nWh-what!?Maya:\nNick. Doesn\'t it seem like Detective Gumshoe is being a little vague?Phoenix:\nI bet von Karma is feeding him lines! His testimony\'s probably filled with landmines just waiting for me to press.Maya:\nWhat do we do?Phoenix:\nGrit our teeth and press, I guess. What else can we do?Maya:\nWell said, Nick! You\'re the man!After pressing fifth statement and pressing modified sixth statement:Karma:\nMembers of the court... We now have the pistol used in the murder, and the bullet found in the body! Detective!Gumshoe:\nY-y-yessir!Karma:\nWas the bullet found in the body fired from this pistol?Gumshoe:\nYes. The ballistic markings on the bullet match the pistol.Judge:\nHmm...Maya:\nHey, Nick! What does he mean, "ballistic markings"?Karma:\nShocking! To imagine someone here does not know something as basic as ballistic markings!Maya:\nN-Nick! He\'s glaring at me!Karma:\nTsk... very well, I\'ll explain. Actually, Judge! You do it.Judge:\nEh? M-me? ... Erm, ahem. Ballistic markings are like the "fingerprints" of a gun. The barrel leaves distinctive marks on each bullet it fires. You can examine these "ballistic fingerprints" to see which gun fired the shot. It\'s quite accurate.Karma:\nIndeed. This leads to one, inevitable conclusion: the bullet found in the victim\'s heart... was, without a doubt, fired from this pistol. This pistol which, as you may recall, was covered with the defendant\'s own fingerprints!Judge:\nO-order! Order!Phoenix:\n(This is bad... This makes it look like Edgeworth did it!)Karma:\nWell, Judge?Judge:\nI\'d say it\'s almost decisive, yes. Honestly, I could declare a verdict at this point. However...Karma:\nYou wish to hear the witness speak, no doubt. Very well. I am somewhat fatigued, and so I will take a brief break. I will call my witness after the recess. Which will last ten minutes. Judge!Judge:\nY-yes?Karma:\nWhat are you doing? A ten minute recess! Now!Judge:\nB-but, wait, I...Karma:\nJust bang your flimsy gavel and get on with it, man!Judge:\nY-yes! Ahem. This court will take a ten minute recess.Phoenix:\n(Who\'s running this court, anyway!?)December 26, 11:09 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2Phoenix:\nEdgeworth! What\'s going on here!? Your fingerprints were on the murder weapon!Edgeworth:\nUh... hmm...Phoenix:\nAnd that foggy photo makes one thing clear... The only one who could have shot that man was the person in the photo!Edgeworth:\nTrue...Phoenix:\nWas that you in the boat?Edgeworth:\n... Yes. It was me.Phoenix:\nWhat!?Edgeworth:\nBut... you must believe me. I didn\'t shoot him.Phoenix:\nTh-then who did!?Edgeworth:\nI... don\'t know.Phoenix:\nYou don\'t know!? Weren\'t you right there!?Edgeworth:\n... I heard a gunshot from very close by. Then... the other man fell from the boat. I can\'t say why, but... I thought, at the time, that he had shot himself!Phoenix:\nY-you mean it was a suicide!?Edgeworth:\n... That\'s the only explanation I can come up with.Phoenix:\nHuh... (How am I going to convince anyone of that!?) Say, Maya?Maya:\nHuh? Wh-what?Phoenix:\nAny progress with Mia?Maya:\nOh... Sorry. It\'s no good.Phoenix:\nUgh...Maya:\nI know... I\'m no good for anything, am I, Nick? If I can\'t call my sister, I might as well not be here, right?No, I need you here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nNo, of course not, I need you here! I can see you\'re always trying to help out. Even if you don\'t actually help... it\'s the thought that counts, right?\nMaya:\nIt\'s okay Nick, you don\'t have to make me feel better.\nLeads to:\n"I don\'t know anything about trials, or defense..."Yeah, you\'re useless\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm, well, actually... (You don\'t know law, you don\'t have any trial experience or techniques... Yeah, you\'re pretty much useless... but I can\'t say that!)\nMaya:\nIt\'s okay Nick. You don\'t have to say anything. Your face said it for you.\nPhoenix:\n(Whoops!) N-no, o-of course we... I\'m sorry.\nMaya:\nIt\'s okay Nick.\nLeads to:\n"I don\'t know anything about trials, or defense..."Maya:\nI don\'t know anything about trials, or defense... What\'s more, I\'m a spirit medium who can\'t even contact spirits...Phoenix:\nAww, everyone has their off days! I mean, I\'ve just been getting lucky lately... But you never know when my luck is going to run out!Maya:\nReally...?Edgeworth:\nW-w-whoa! Wright! Don\'t jinx this case any worse than it already is! It\'s bad for my heart...Phoenix:\nOh? Oh! S-sorry... (Whoops!)Judge:\nCourt is back in session. Mr. von Karma, call your witness.Karma:\nYes. Will Ms. Lotta Hart take the stand?Karma:\nLotta Hart, you are a research student at a university?Lotta:\nThat I am.Karma:\nGood. Begin by telling us what you saw the night of the incident. And don\'t add anything trivial or subjective. Understand?Lotta:\n... Y\'all need to learn some manners.Karma:\nUNDERSTAND?Lotta:\nY-yeah, I understand, I understand!Judge:\nEr... very well. Your testimony, please.Witness Testimony-- Witness\'s Account --Lotta:\nIt was Christmas Eve, just after midnight, I reckon.\nI was in my car.\nI heard this "bang" come up from the lake.\nWhen I looked out the window, I saw two gents in a boat.\nThen there was another "bang"...\nThere wasn\'t nary a thing on the lake but that boat.Karma:\nEnough.Lotta:\nHuh?Karma:\nJudge! She happened to take a photo of the incident! This is that photo. Accept it as evidence.Judge:\nW-well! This is a surprise! This looks like... the very moment of the murder! O-Order! I will remove you from the court if I do not have order immediately!Karma:\nAs the witness testified, she looked at the lake when she heard the shot. There were no other boats on that lake! So, the man in the boat with the victim must have been the one who shot him... Yes. It was the defendant, Miles Edgeworth!!!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order...! I will have order!Karma:\n... Well, Judge?Judge:\nThe evidence is... decisive. I have very little doubt about this case. Very well, this court finds the defendant...Phoenix:Phoenix:\nW-wait! Your Honor! I haven\'t cross-examined the witness yet!Karma:\nA cross-examination? We have photographic proof! What question can there possibly be!? This photo is worth a thousand words... and they all read "guilty"! You lose. Or... Do you claim to have found a contradiction in her testimony!?Phoenix:\n...!Karma:\nVery well. If you have to, you may cross-examine the witness. You will only flounder and ask meaningless questions! You will fail to find anything! And then, I will have you held in contempt of court!Maya:\nUh, Nick... contempt...?Phoenix:\n"Contempt of court," you know?Maya:\nI... guess I understand. Well... what are you going to do? Do you really think there was a contradiction with the facts in her testimony?I think there was\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI... think I noticed one little thing...\nMaya:\nWow, I\'m impressed, Nick! I didn\'t notice anything! Right! Let\'s take him on!\nPhoenix:\nY-yeah... (I got a bad feeling about this...)\nLeads to:\n"I understand... I will cross-examine the witness!"I think there wasn\'t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHonestly, I found nothing.\nMaya:\nI dunno, I thought her testimony was strange. She was so vague about everything!\nPhoenix:\nI bet von Karma probably fed her her lines.\nMaya:\nBut... But if you don\'t cross-examine her, the judge will...\nPhoenix:\nHe\'ll bang down that "flimsy gavel" of his and declare Edgeworth guilty.\nMaya:\nI guess we\'ll just have to bluff it.\nPhoenix:\nBut if we mess up... contempt of court.\nMaya:\nHey, if we lose we\'ll be held in public contempt!\nPhoenix:\nEr... right.\nLeads to:\n"I understand... I will cross-examine the witness!"Phoenix:\nI understand... I will cross-examine the witness!Karma:\nTsk tsk tsk... Very well!Judge:\nI pray for your sake this isn\'t a waste of time.Cross Examination-- Witness\'s Account --Lotta:\nIt was Christmas Eve, just after midnight, I reckon.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n"Just after midnight," you say? In other words, it was no longer Christmas Eve... but Christmas Day!\nLotta:\nHuh? Uh, yeah, well, yes.\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nI know you want to find contradictions, but really!\nPhoenix:\nMmmph.\nJudge:\nI hope your next contradiction is a little more relevant to the trial.Lotta:\nI was in my car.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy were you camping there, anyway?\nLotta:\nI\'m a research student at my university. I was taking pictures to use in my research.\nPhoenix:\n(What research? This all sounds suspicious...)\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMs. Hart. Could you be more specific about your "research"?\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nWhat does the witness\'s motive in camping by the lake have to do with this case!? The answer "is nothing"! I object to this line of questioning! Objection sustained!\nJudge:\nW-w-wait, now, I\'m the one who says that!\nKarma:\nWell, then say it already!\nJudge:\nObjection sustained.\nPhoenix:\n(Thanks for nothing, Your Honor...)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nHold back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I think I\'ll let that one slide for now.)\nLeads back to cross-examinationLotta:\nI heard this "bang" come up from the lake.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, you weren\'t looking at the lake at that time?\nLotta:\nNope. I looked after I heard that noise.\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nShe\'s said that already! I asked you to find "contradictions"! Not leisurely chat with the witness!\nPhoenix:\n(Urk...)Lotta:\nWhen I looked out the window, I saw two gents in a boat.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nCould you clearly see the two men?\nLotta:\nJust look at the picture! Clear enough for you?\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh...)\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWait a second! I wasn\'t asking you about the photo! I was asking if YOU saw the two men!\nLotta:\nUh, yeah, well, of course...\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nThe witness has testified that she saw them! There\'s also a photo! You\'d best look elsewhere for your precious contradictions!\nPhoenix:\n(He jumped in quick... He\'s hiding something!)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nHold back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I think I\'d best let that one slide...)\nLeads back to cross-examinationLotta:\nThen there was another "bang"...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWere you watching the very moment the shot rang out?\nLotta:\nWell, yeah, sure...\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nYou\'re asking meaningless questions! Meaningless! "Contradictions," Mr. Wright. Not meaningless babble!\nPhoenix:\n(von Karma, I think I hate you. He\'s trying to keep me from talking to the witness... To what end...?)Lotta:\nThere wasn\'t nary a thing on the lake but that boat.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure about that?\nLotta:\nYeah, sure as a country gal can be!\nPhoenix:\n(That sounds pretty sure.)\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHow come you\'re so sure?\nLotta:\nWell, heck, I scanned the whole lake.\nPhoenix:\n("Scanned the whole lake"? It almost sounds like she was more interested in the lake than the boat...) Ms. Hart... you--\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nMr. Wright! The witness has answered the question in full.\nPhoenix:\nMmph!\nKarma:\nNo need for further questions! Objection sustained!\nJudge:\nU-uh, that\'s what I\'m...\nKarma:\nSustained!\nJudge:\nY-yes, of course.\nPhoenix:\n(Oh great... What am I supposed to do now?)\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nHold back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Lotta seems pretty sure of herself. I\'d better not forge blindly ahead here. Still... this whole thing stinks.)\nLeads back to cross-examinationPhoenix:\n(Th-there weren\'t any contradictions in there!)Maya:\nSorry, Nick. If only my sister were here...Phoenix:\n(Maya\'s really taking this hard.)After selecting "Press further" upon pressing second, fourth, and sixth statements, and pressing fifth statement:Judge:\nEnough! I think we\'ve heard all we need to hear, Mr. Wright. It seems you are unable to find a contradiction in the testimony worth noting.Phoenix:\nB-but, Your Honor!Karma:\nYou keep your promise!Judge:\nMr. Wright. I am afraid that I will have to penalize any further outbursts... By holding you in contempt of court!Karma:\nAnd if that happens, you\'ll have to leave the courtroom immediately! Understood...?Phoenix:\nUh... uh huh.Maya:\nNick...! Lotta\'s testimony is fishy, Nick! Real fishy!Phoenix:\nI... know what you mean. But... If I can\'t say anything, what can I do?Judge:\nI believe we\'ve covered the evidence sufficiently to make a decision.Karma:\nThen, pass your judgment!Judge:\nVery well. Mr. Miles Edgeworth, please take the stand.???:Judge:\nWh-who was that!?Maya:\nIt... was me.Phoenix:\n(Maya!)Judge:\nI-is something wrong? D-do you need to use the facilities?Maya:\nNo, I do not! Lotta Hart! Your testimony stinks! It\'s unclear whether you were actually looking at the lake! It\'s highly doubtful that you actually say Mr. Edgeworth! Tell us the truth! This is a matter of life or death!Lotta:\n...!Maya:\nLotta! Did you really clearly see Mr. Edgeworth that night!? Did you see him fire that pistol!?Judge:\nYou will stand down! The court does not acknowledge the defense\'s outburst!Maya:\nAnswer me, Lotta!Lotta:\nWhat\'s the big idea, treating me like some kind of criminal!? I saw him! I swear it! I saw Edgeworth...Karma:Karma:\nEnough! Judge... Declare the defense in contempt of court!Judge:\nY-yes... yes, of course. I\'m sorry, but you WERE warned. Guard! Escort Mr. Wright out of the courtroom! He is in contempt of court, and must leave.Phoenix:\n(No... No...!)Wait!Maya:\nI-I was the one who made the outburst, Your Honor! Nick is innocent!Karma:\nHah! What\'s the difference? All that remains is for the guilty verdict to be declared! Isn\'t that right, Mr. Phoenix Wright!?Wrong\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWrong!\nKarma:\nWhat!?\nLeads to:\n"Did you hear what Ms. Hart just said?"Right\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Dammit, he\'s right...)\nMaya:\nN-Nick! There must be something we can do!\nPhoenix:\nI... don\'t think there is. The cross-examination is over already!\nMaya:\nB-but... but didn\'t Lotta just say she saw him? She did, Nick! She just said that she saw Mr. Edgeworth! She didn\'t say that in her testimony, did she?\nPhoenix:\n...! Y-you\'re right! Your Honor!\nLeads to:\n"Did you hear what Ms. Hart just said?"Phoenix:\nDid you hear what Ms. Hart just said? She said she clearly saw Mr. Edgeworth! That was not in the testimony! That changes her testimony, and I have a right to cross-examine her again!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! Order! Order! Order!Karma:\nYou\'re in contempt of court! It\'s too late for wild claims! Judge! Sustain my objection!Judge:\n... ... I\'m sorry, Mr. von Karma, but I cannot.Karma:\nWhat!?Judge:\nMs. Lotta Hart has made a new testimony. The defense does have a right to cross-examine her again.Karma:\nB-but he is in contempt of court!Maya:\nNo, I am! If you\'re going to arrest someone, arrest me!Judge:\nHmm... Very well. Maya Fey! You will leave the courtroom immediately.Maya:\nNick! I did what I could... You have to do the rest! Good luck!Phoenix:\nM-Maya...!Karma:\nPeh! I care not for this melodrama! Listen well, Mr. Wright! I do not tolerate badgering of my witnesses!Phoenix:\n(I\'m running out of time... I\'d better find a contradiction in here or else...)Judge:\nMr. Wright! Begin your cross-examination!Cross Examination-- That Last Statement --Lotta:\nI saw it clear as day. The man on the boat was Mr. Edgeworth!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, what about the other man?\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nYou cannot expect to be allowed to blithely ignore your promise, Mr. Wright! I believe you claimed there was a contradiction in the witness\'s testimony! Well, find it! If you can!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright, I have to assign you a penalty.\nPhoenix:\n(Damn...!)Present Lake Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n"Got you."Phoenix:\n(That\'s it...? Uh oh. I don\'t know if I can find anything in that... What will Maya say...?)Phoenix:\nGot you. Got you, Ms. Hart! Finally!Lotta:\nWh-what!? You got what?Phoenix:\nLook at this photograph.Lotta:\nThe photo I took...?Phoenix:\nThe very same. There\'s something I want you to see in this photo... it\'s quite clearly visible. The fog, Ms. Hart.Lotta:\nSo... so?Phoenix:\nThis picture was taken with professional, high quality film, correct? Yet even it could not capture the faces of the men on the boat! Yet you claim you saw Mr. Edgeworth! How!?Lotta:\nWhut!? Wha--!Judge:\nMr. Wright has a point!Karma:Karma:\nThat\'s why I told her not to say that in her testimony! Please!Phoenix:\nYet, now she has said it, Mr. von Karma. How could you possibly see Mr. Edgeworth!? Explain yourself!Judge:\nMs. Hart.Lotta:\nWhat!Judge:\nCould you see the defendant that night?Lotta:\nO-of course! I said I could and I meant I could!Judge:\nThen, please testify as to the circumstances of your sighting.Phoenix:\n(I did it! I finally found a hole in von Karma\'s carefully vague testimony!)Witness Testimony-- How Edgeworth Was Seen --Lotta:\nYer right. It was a cold night, and the fog was thick as grits.\nSo, once I was finished setting up my camera, I got back in the car.\nStill, I brought my binoculars with me.\nWhen I heard that noise out on the lake, I looked with my binoculars.\nSee? No problem!Judge:\nHmm...You used binoculars? Very well. You may begin your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\n(This one\'d better be good!)Cross Examination-- How Edgeworth Was Seen --Lotta:\nYer right. It was a cold night, and the mist was thick as grits.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo? How could you see Edgeworth!?\nLotta:\nNow, just hold your horses for a second! You hasty Yankee types\'d never find a gal where I\'m from.\nJudge:\nDefense attorneys have trouble with that as it is.\nPhoenix:\n(Nobody loves me...)Lotta:\nSo, once I was finished setting up my camera, I got back in the car.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYour "camera"...?\nLotta:\nYeah. It\'s got an automatic...\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nThe issue we are concerned with here is Ms. Hart seeing Mr. Edgeworth! The camera has nothing to do with this at all!\nJudge:\nObjection sustained.\nPhoenix:\n(Argh! He\'s not letting her answer any of my questions!)Lotta:\nStill, I brought my binoculars with me.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n"Binoculars"?\nLotta:\nYeah, binoculars.\nPhoenix:\nYesterday, you mentioned that you were out looking for shooting stars, correct?\nLotta:\nWell... yeah.\nPhoenix:\nWouldn\'t you need a telescope, not binoculars, for that?\nLotta:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nI\'ve got doubts about your camera, too! Was that really to take pictures of meteor showers?\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nThe camera is irrelevant to this case!\nPhoenix:\nYou can\'t say that for certain!\nJudge:\nHmm... Mr. Wright. Is the camera really relevant to this case? If you believe it is, you may continue with this line of questioning.\nKarma:\nBut know this! If you find nothing with this, there will be consequences!\nJudge:\nWell, Mr. Wright? Do you wish to press further about the camera?\n\n\n\nPress further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(This is make-it-or-break-it time!) The camera is of utmost importance, Your Honor. It is, perhaps, the key to this entire case! Therefore, I will continue my line of questioning! (Wow! Maybe I went a little overboard there...)\nJudge:\nVery well! Ms. Hart! You will testify to the court about the camera!\nLotta:\nYeah, yeah, I hear ya.\nChanges statement from "Still, I brought my binoculars with me." to "The camera was set up to take pictures of a meteor shower."\n\n\n\n\nHold back\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOkay, Your Honor... I withdraw my question. (I have to remember who I\'m dealing with! I bet von Karma wants to trap me so he can put me in contempt! I think I\'ll hang back for now and see what happens.)\nKarma:\nHah!\nLeads back to cross-examinationLotta:\nThe camera was set up to take pictures of a meteor shower.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nMs. Hart. What made you choose that lake to photograph meteors? You know the fog gets thick on that lake. It\'s not very suited to stargazing.\nLotta:\nYeah, well... Y\'see, I... I guess I wasn\'t thinking too straight! Har!\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nMr. Wright! I will not have you badgering my witness because of her challenged intellect!\nLotta:\nNow wait a minute!\nKarma:\nContinue your testimony. You were saying how it was that you saw Edgeworth?\nLotta:\nGrr...\nKarma:\nNo unnecessary comments, please.Present Lotta\'s Camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou were photographing shooting stars? That\'s a lie!\nLotta:\nS-says who!?\nPhoenix:\nI saw the camera you set up yesterday. It was pointed directly at the lake! You have to point a camera upwards to take photos of the stars, Ms. Hart!\nLeads to:\n"Ooof!"Present Lake Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou were photographing shooting stars? That\'s a lie!\nLotta:\nS-says who!?\nPhoenix:\nTake a look at this photograph. This was taken on an automatic setting, was it not?\nLotta:\nY-yeah, that\'s right.\nPhoenix:\nYou have to point a camera upwards to take photos of the stars, Ms. Hart! But, as this photograph clearly shows... The camera was pointed directly at the lake!\nLeads to:\n"Ooof!"Lotta:\nWhen I heard that noise out on the lake, I looked with my binoculars.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nIf there was a heavy fog, how would binoculars change that at all?\nLotta:\nWhat do you mean?\nPhoenix:\nEven binoculars can\'t see through fog! But... you say you clearly saw him?\nLotta:\nEr... I did... yeah.\nKarma:\nEnough! There is no room for doubt in her testimony!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm. She sounded pretty doubtful to me! But... I have to find a clear contradiction first.)Phoenix:\n(I don\'t care how many von Karmic objections I get... I\'m going to find a hole in this testimony if it\'s the last thing I do!)Lotta:\nOoof!Judge:\nMr. Wright! What are you driving at?Phoenix:\nThe witness was not at the lake to photograph shooting stars, Your Honor!Lotta:\n...!Judge:\nW-well then, what exactly was she photographing?Show evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n"Your Honor! Take a look at this..."I don\'t know\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell... that I don\'t know.\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nWhat the witness takes photos of is entirely her business! This has nothing to do with the case! Not to mention that you can\'t even show us another reason why she might have been there. Mr. Wright... If you are out of material, I suggest we end this mockery of a cross-examination.\nPhoenix:\n(Uh oh... I can\'t let the trial end like this! I have to show them something!)\nLeads to:\n"Your Honor! Take a look at this..."Phoenix:\nYour Honor! Take a look at this... What was Ms. Hart trying to photograph at the lake?Present Gourdy Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n"Ms. Hart."Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, Your Honor? What do you think?\nJudge:\nI... think I\'m confused.\nKarma:\nWrong again, Mr. Wright. So very wrong. You can\'t get through this one with your weak bluffs!\nPhoenix:\nY-Your Honor! Enough playing around! Here\'s the real evidence!\nJudge:\n"Enough playing around" is my line, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nUh...\nLeads back to:\n"What was Ms. Hart trying to photograph at the lake?"Phoenix:\nMs. Hart. This is what you were trying to photograph!Judge:\nWhat\'s this? A newspaper article? "Gourdy"...? Ah, the sighting at Gourd Lake...Phoenix:\nWell, Ms. Hart?Lotta:\nI... I never heard of no lake monster! You got proof or something? Let\'s see you prove that I was down at the lake trying to photograph this "Gourdy."I don\'t have proof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, I don\'t have proof...\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nBah! Your ineptitude is entertaining, Mr. Wright, but enough is enough! I\'ve had enough of baseless claims made without a hair of evidence to support them!\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWell all right, if that\'s how you want to play... I\'ll show you evidence!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright! Are you sure about this?\nPhoenix:\n(I\'m sure sick of that smarmy prosecutor putting me down! Or... did he taunt me so I\'d get mad and make a mistake?)\nLeads to:\n"Very well, let\'s see it."I have proof\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI have it! Proof!\nJudge:\nHmm... Intriguing!\nLeads to:\n"Very well, let\'s see it."Judge:\nVery well, let\'s see it. And... no joking around this time, please. Here is proof that the witness was trying to photograph Gourdy, the lake monster!Present Lotta\'s Camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe proof, Ms. Hart, is your own camera!\nLotta:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nYou camera was set to take photos in response to loud noises, correct? Thus this photograph here, taken when a gun fired on the lake.\nLotta:\n...\nPhoenix:\nAnd here, this article about "Gourdy." According to this article... Gourdy made a loud noise when it emerged! Well? You were trying to photograph Gourdy, weren\'t you! That\'s why you had set your camera to respond to loud noises!\nLeads to:\n"Order! Order!"Present Gourdy Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe proof is this article about Gourdy the lake monster!\nLotta:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nAccording to this article... When Gourdy breaks through the water, it makes a loud noise! Which is why you set up your camera with that microphone! You had it set to respond to loud noises! And that\'s how you got this picture when the pistol fired!\nLeads to:\n"Order! Order!"Present anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHere\'s my proof! It\'s simple!\nJudge:\n... If it\'s simple... then why have you obviously made an error, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nUrk...?\nLotta:\nWhat\'s that!?\nKarma:\nGo home. Consider a career change.\nPhoenix:\n(Gah! How can they so casually toss aside this eviden... Oh. Whoops. Wrong evidence.)\nJudge:\nLuckily for you, I\'m in a patient mood, Mr. Wright. One more time please.\nLeads back to:\n"Here is proof that the witness was trying to photograph Gourdy, the lake monster!"Judge:\nOrder! Order! I see... I, too, thought it was a little strange.Phoenix:\n(Yeah, sure!) Well, Ms. Hart? You were camping there to try and take a photo of Gourdy, weren\'t you?Lotta:\n... Yeah. Not bad. Are all you lawyers that smart? So, smart boy, I was down there trying to photograph Gourdy, you got me. So what?Phoenix:\nHuh...?Lotta:\nThat don\'t change what I saw, does it?Karma:\nExactly! What you just used several precious minutes of our time to prove... is nothing more than that the witness is an idiot who thinks monsters exist!Lotta:\nH-hey!Karma:\nBut, as she so succinctly said, so what!? It changes nothing!Phoenix:\n(Not true! You were hiding the whole thing about Gourdy for some reason, I know it! But what could it have been...? Whatever it is, I\'m getting to the bottom of this!)Judge:\nMs. Hart. Why did you hide the fact that you were searching for Gourdy from the court? Please revise your testimony.Lotta:\n... Right. Fine, I\'ll testify. It won\'t change nothing, though.Phoenix:\n(Something will change... it has to! And I\'m going to spot it!)Karma:\n...Witness Testimony-- Lotta\'s New Testimony --Lotta:\nActually, I\'m not a research student at a university.\nI\'m an investigative photographer.\nImagine what a scoop it\'d be if I got a picture of that monster!\nThat\'s why I was camping out by the lake.\nBut, that\'s all I was hiding.\nWhen I heard the "bang" I looked right straight out at that lake.\nThere wasn\'t much else to look at, so I just watched that boat the whole time.\nThen I saw a flash, near one of the men\'s hands, and I heard another gunshot.\nI was looking right at that boat, the whole time, cross my heart and hope to fry.Judge:\nHmm... Well, Mr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.Karma:Karma:\nThe witness\'s testimony is unchanged from before! Whether she is a research student or a photographer has no bearing on this case! There is no need to waste more of our time with another pointless cross-examination!Judge:\nEr... hmm.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nI claim the defense\'s right to cross-examine the witness, Your Honor! (von Karma\'s up to something, I know it! He doesn\'t want me to cross-examine her because... why? Was there a contradiction?)Judge:\nVery well. You may begin the cross-examination. You seem sure of yourself, you must have something in mind.Karma:\nHah! That would be a first!Phoenix:\n(Hah hah, very funny.)Judge:\nYou understand that this is your last chance at a cross-examination, Mr. Wright? If there is no problem with the testimony this time, we will let the witness leave. I will announce my verdict at that time, Mr. Wright. Understood?Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.Cross Examination-- Lotta\'s New Testimony --Lotta:\nActually, I\'m not a research student at a university.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThen what manner of person are you!?\nLotta:\nI\'m not sure I\'m high-falutin\' enough to be called a "manner" of anything.Lotta:\nI\'m an investigative photographer.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAn "investigative photographer"?\nLotta:\nYep. You get your photo, and sell it to the press. It\'s that kind of business. Hey, I was taking pictures at my sister\'s graduation last year... N\' guess what!\nPhoenix:\nUmm... what?\nLotta:\nThere was a yoofoh just a\' hanging in the sky!\nPhoenix:\nA "yoofoh"...?\nLotta:\nYou know, an "Unidentified Flying Object"? A yoofoh! That\'s when I had sort of a revelation. I knew I should become an investigative photographer!\nPhoenix:\nI... I see. (Kind of a shaky basis for a career...)Lotta:\nImagine what a scoop it\'d be if I got a picture of that monster!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nIs "Gourdy" really all that newsworthy?\nLotta:\nHeck yeah! They even had him up on the TV!\nPhoenix:\n(I\'m not sure that appearing on the local news "rumor of the month" show qualifies. Last month\'s show was "Bigfoot Sighted on Acorn Hill," I believe.)\nLotta:\nHey! They also had a picture of him in the newspaper! For real!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright. This is one fight I do not believe you can win. Let\'s keep moving, shall we?\nPhoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.Lotta:\nThat\'s why I was camping out by the lake.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThat\'s why you put the automatic senior on your camera?\nLotta:\nYep. Borrowed it from a friend at a university. It analyzes every sound it picks up, and when it gets a "bang!"...\nPhoenix:\nIt snaps a shot.\nLotta:\nYep.\nPhoenix:\nSo, how many pictures has it taken so far?\nLotta:\nThe only time the camera triggered was that night.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm...)Lotta:\nBut, that\'s all I was hiding.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nI think it\'s time you told us why you felt you had to hide your true purpose at the lake.\nLotta:\nHeck, if word got out what I was up to, the lake\'d be swarmin\' with competitors!\nPhoenix:\nCompetitors...?\nLotta:\nYeah! Second-rate shutterbugs trying to steal my scoop!\nPhoenix:\nAh... Is that the only reason you were hiding the truth?\nLotta:\nW-well, actually...\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nMr. Wright! I\'ll not have you asking questions with no relevance to this case!!!\nPhoenix:\n(Whatever you say, von Karma. I know you told her to keep quiet.)Lotta:\nWhen I heard the "bang" I looked right straight out at that lake.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nExactly what sort of sound was it?\nLotta:\nWell, I never heard one before so I can\'t say for sure... but it sounded like a gunshot. It was a lot sharper a sound than I would have expected.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmmm...)Present Gourdy Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n"Ms. Hart!"Lotta:\nThere wasn\'t much else to look at, so I just watched that boat the whole time.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThere wasn\'t "much else to look at"?\nLotta:\nYep.\nPhoenix:\n(I dunno. If she heard a bang... and she thought Gourdy was out there... I kind of doubt she\'d waste any time looking at a boat.)\nLotta:\nWhat? What did I do now? What\'re you giving me that look for?\nPhoenix:\n(Definitely suspicious... Maybe it\'s time for some evidence...)\nKarma:\nWitness! Continue.\nLotta:\nHold your hushpuppies, pops, I\'m getting there.Present Gourdy Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n"Ms. Hart!"Lotta:\nThen I saw a flash, near one of the men\'s hands, and I heard another gunshot.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWas there nothing on the lake but the boat at that time?\nLotta:\nHuh? Wait, so you\'re thinking maybe he was shot from some other place? I don\'t think so, nope. The lake was smooth as glass, and nobody was on the shore, neither.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm...)Present Gourdy Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n"Ms. Hart!"Phoenix:\n(I\'d better find some sort of contradiction in this testimony... I won\'t be able to beat von Karma any other way... There has to be something!)Phoenix:\nMs. Hart! Were you REALLY looking at that boat!?Lotta:\nW-what\'s with you!? Course I was looking at it! It was the only thing out there! Any normal person\'d be looking at it!Phoenix:\nI agree, any normal person would. But you are far from normal!Lotta:\nWh-what!? Y\'all wanna step over here and say that!?Phoenix:\nYou were camping at the lake to take a picture of Gourdy! Think about it-- What would you do if you heard a loud noise? You\'d be scanning the lake for any sign of Gourdy, that\'s what! You wouldn\'t give the boat a second thought!Lotta:\nAah!Judge:\nOrder! Continue, Mr. Wright!Phoenix:\nYou testified that you were watching the boat through binoculars! However, you wouldn\'t need binoculars to watch that boat! You needed them to search for Gourdy... and that\'s what you were doing!Lotta:\n...! ... ...Phoenix:\nWell!?Lotta:\nHmph... Well, now that y\'all mention it... I did sort of take my binoculars and kind of scan the lake a bit... I mean, Gourdy might be out there, n\' all...Judge:\nM-Ms. Hart! A-are you saying that you were NOT watching the boat, then?Lotta:\n... S-sorry, y\'all. I wasn\'t fibbing, really. I was, just... I thought y\'know, I could be witness to a murder n\' all! I kinda got excited. I was sure I was watching that boat... till now.Judge:\n... This... this is totally uncalled for--Lotta:\nB-but hey! You got the photograph! You got proof!Judge:\nHmm... Still, we can\'t see who is shooting who in this.Lotta:\nRight! Right! That\'s why I took this photo n\'...Karma:Karma:\nWitness... That\'s enough. You\'ve had a long day. Shut your pie-hole.Lotta:\nSh-shut my what!?Phoenix:\n(What was she going to say? She took the photo... and what? Wait a second...)Gumshoe:\nShe even had a photograph to prove it.Phoenix:\nBut you really can\'t tell from the photo who is shooting.Gumshoe:\nThat\'s why she said she\'s going to enlarge the photo. She said "it\'ll drop the quality a mite, but should let us see who\'s who!"Phoenix:\n(She enlarged that photo! Why won\'t von Karma let her show it? I\'ve got a hunch! I bet that enlarged photo shows something bad for von Karma! This is my chance! If I\'m wrong, though, it\'ll mean prison for Edgeworth... or worse. What should I do!?)Make her show the enlargement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n"Ms. Hart! Look at this photograph."Wait and see what happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(If this is a trap...

Right away!\nLeads back to:\n"I\'ll show you the evidence that left hand contradicts!"Phoenix:\nThe evidence is clear. The man in this photograph is holding that pistol in his left hand. However! The prints on the murder weapon were from Edgeworth\'s "right hand"! Ergo! The man shooting the pistol in this photograph... Is not Mr. Edgeworth!!!Judge:\nNow that everyone in the courtroom has quieted down... I would like to reconvene this court of law! Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.Judge:\nYou have given us definitive proof today. We now know that it was not Mr. Edgeworth who fired the pistol that night. However... This leaves us with a rather large problem. If Mr. Edgeworth didn\'t do it, then who shot our victim?Karma:\nPrecisely! As we have seen, there were no other people on the lake that night! Who but the defendant could have shot the victim!?Ms. Hart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWho else but the witness, Ms. Lotta Hart!\nJudge:\nWh-what!? Do you have proof of this!?\nPhoenix:\n(Proof-shmoof!

Sacrifice one friend to save another? What\'s the point!?)\nKarma:\nWell, Wright! Your answer!\nLeads back to:\n"Who but the defendant could have shot the victim!?"Phoenix:\nThere is only one explanation remaining! The man who shot the victim was none other than... the victim himself!!!Judge:\nOrder! Order! So... you are saying that the victim committed suicide?Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. I can think of no other explanation.Judge:\nHmm... Indeed, that does seem to be the only remaining option.Karma:Karma:\nI\'m so very, very sorry, Mr. Wright. But suicide is out of the question.Phoenix:\nWh-what!?Karma:\nAn examination of the victim\'s wound reveals the distance at which he was shot.Phoenix:\nThe... distance?Karma:\nThe victim was clearly shot from further than a meter away!Phoenix:\nA meter! Th-that\'s three feet!Karma:\nThere is no way it could have been suicide!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Mr. von Karma! Are you sure of the accuracy of your data!?Karma:\nOf course! I had already considered the possibility of suicide, you see.Autopsy Report updated in the Court Record.Judge:\nHmm... I see. Very well, allow me to state my opinion. Considering the situation, the shooter had to be the defendant, Mr. Edgeworth. However! The prints on the gun reveal that the shooter was not Mr. Edgeworth. This is a conundrum. Therefore, I would like to suspend proceedings for this trial for the day. The court orders the defense and the prosecution to further investigate this matter. Understood?Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor.Karma:\n...Judge:\nThat is all. The court is adjourned.December 26, 1:15 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2Phoenix:\nWhew, that was a close one.Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\nHey! Don\'t you have anything to say!?Edgeworth:\nNo. I have yet to be declared innocent, Wright.Phoenix:\nWell, yeah, but... What happened out there on that lake, anyway!? If he didn\'t commit suicide, then who...? The shooter was about a meter away, too!Edgeworth:\n... W-what? Don\'t give me that look! I did not kill him!Phoenix:\nI was just kidding around.Edgeworth:\nHmph.Phoenix:\nLook... I\'m going to go check on Maya.Edgeworth:\nOh... Wright.Phoenix:\nWhat?Edgeworth:\nTell her something for me.Phoenix:\nWhat?Edgeworth:\n... ... ... Tell... Tell her to watch what she says in court. That\'s all.Phoenix:\n(Would it kill you to just state how you really feel with a "thanks", Edgeworth?) (Changed from [Yeah, I\'m sure she\'ll be happy to hear you say that, Edgeworth. Jerk!] in the original release)Phoenix:\nI requisitioned a transcript of Lotta\'s entire testimony. I thought it might give me some ammunition for the trial tomorrow. Of course she didn\'t see the shooter... So the only part of her testimony that stood was the "bang" she heard.Lotta\'s Deposition added to the Court Record.To be continued.Presenting wrong evidence during testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor!

Objection overruled.\nPhoenix:\n(I don\'t think that won me any points with the judge...)Presenting wrong evidence during testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThis evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!\nJudge:\nHow exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...?\nPhoenix:\nThey aren\'t, are they...\nJudge:\nNot at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.\nPhoenix:\n(I don\'t think that won me any points with the judge...)Presenting wrong evidence during testimony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe witness\'s statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!\nJudge:\n... I\'m sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\n(Ugh. I must be on the wrong track?)Too many penalties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge:\nThis court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court find the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth...\n\nGuilty\n\nJudge:\nThe accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today\'s date. That is all. The court is adjourned!Turnabout Goodbyes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranscriptPart 1\n\nPart 2\n\nPart 3\n\nPart 4\n\nPart 5\n\nPart 6December 26Detention CenterVisitor\'s RoomPhoenix:\nMaya!Maya:\nHey! Nick, it\'s you! I\'m glad Mr. Edgeworth made it through the day okay. It\'s a relief...Phoenix:\nHey. Why\'d you do that, anyway?Maya:\n... I don\'t know. I... just knew I had to do something. I know I\'m not the lawyer my sister was... ... I\'m sorry.Phoenix:\nWell, you did save the trial... Just, behave from now on, okay?Maya:\nO... Okay.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestioning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHave you been questioned yet?\nMaya:\nNo... not yet. Detective Gumshoe was here just now. He said "seeing as this is your first offense, we\'ll let you go after questioning."\nPhoenix:\nWhew...\nMaya:\nOh, and he wanted me to get bail money ready. You can pay for me, okay?\nPhoenix:\nHuh? How much?\nMaya:\nI don\'t know. I guess they\'ll send you a bill or something.\nPhoenix:\n(Why do I picture giant bales of money every time I hear the word "bail"?)\n\n\n\n\nMia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAny luck with Mia...?\nMaya:\nNone... I can\'t get through to her at all. I tried... I really did! I don\'t know what to do... ... I think I probably shouldn\'t have stopped my training.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... she sounds like she really did do her best. I should check and see if there are any waterfalls in the local area...)\nMaya:\nI wonder if I\'ll ever see my sister again...Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney\'s Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nIt must be nice, Nick. You can just show that to anyone and say "I\'m a lawyer!" But, spirit mediums, well...\nPhoenix:\nI dunno, with your clothes, I bet at least some people would recognize you...\nMaya:\nBut these are medium-in-training clothes... I wonder if I\'ll ever be a proper medium...\n\n\n\n\nLake Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nIsn\'t that the enlarged photo Lotta was talking about?\nPhoenix:\nUh huh.\nMaya:\nHuh... It\'s nice and big... but you can\'t really see the faces any clearer, can you?\n\n\n\n\nMisty Fey\'s Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nMy... mother. ...\nPhoenix:\n(Now that I\'ve shown her the picture, I\'m not so sure it was the right thing to do. No... I\'m pretty sure it was the wrong thing to do.)\n\n\n\n\nGourdy Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nI want to see Gourdy, too!\nPhoenix:\nIf he really exists.\nMaya:\nWell, I\'d say a photograph is pretty good proof! Once this trial is over, let\'s get some fishing poles and go down to the lake!\nPhoenix:\n(Even if there is a monster in that lake, fishing poles sound like a BAD idea...)\n\n\n\n\nPistol Bullet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nSo the markings on this bullet and the barrel of the pistol matched?\nPhoenix:\nHey, I\'m surprised you remembered that!\nMaya:\nHow could I forget after von Karma rubbed it in so much? So, which one of these are the ballistic markings?\nPhoenix:\nI\'m... not really sure.\n\n\n\n\nPistol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nMr. Edgeworth\'s prints are on this pistol, aren\'t they?\nPhoenix:\nYes... the prints from his right hand. But they must have gotten on there at some other time other than the shooting.\nMaya:\nWhat? Really!?\nPhoenix:\n(The shooter used his left hand, after all...)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nSorry... I\'m fresh out of ideas.December 26Wright & Co. Law OfficesPhoenix:\n... Sure is quiet here with nobody around. Right... I have to get Maya out of that detention cell soon!December 26Police DepartmentCriminal AffairsPhoenix:\n(Detective Gumshoe\'s not here...)Police:\nGumshoe\'s at the scene again today.Phoenix:\nHuh? Oh, really?Police:\nHe\'s a live wire that one. Got into a fight with the chief for not following protocol...Phoenix:\n(Not following protocol...? I bet he wouldn\'t help them build the case against Edgeworth...)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetective\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThat must be one of the detectives. He\'s mumbling something to himself.\nPolice:\n"Don\'t do anything rash! Why jump...? ...You have every reason to live!"\nPhoenix:\n... He must be doing image training for talking down a potential suicide.\n\n\n\n\nChief\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThis must be the chief of the detectives here. He\'s glued to his computer screen.\nChief:\nWha...!? Rook to Bishop 7... Checkmate!? I don\'t believe it!\nPhoenix:\n(He must be playing chess on the computer...)December 26Grossberg Law OfficesPhoenix:\nApparently, Mr. Grossberg is on vacation today. Well, I guess I can come back tomorrow if I need anything.Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBookshelf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nExpensive-looking mahogany bookshelves, filled with expensive-looking books. Hmm... funny... they don\'t look like they\'ve ever been read.\n\n\n\n\nDesk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA solid mahogany desk. The wood\'s been polished to a deep luster.\n\n\n\n\nVacant wall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI guess Mr. Grossberg isn\'t getting that painting back. I feel kind of bad for him...\n\n\n\n\nPotted plant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAn expensive potted plant. No idea what kind of plant it is, but it\'s probably the most expensive one available.\n\n\n\n\nTable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA table for clients. Hmm... an elegant ebony case, and if I\'m not mistaken, that lighter\'s made of solid gold. Even I can tell someone here\'s got money to burn.December 26Gourd Lake ParkEntrancePhoenix:\nThere are fewer than there were yesterday, but the cops are still around in the park. I wonder if Detective Gumshoe is here today?Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrees\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI feel winter\'s chill from the bare leaf trees today... There\'s a lot of trees here. I guess that\'s why they call it a "nature park." It\'s quite pretty when the cherry trees along the lakeside blossom in spring. Today... it\'s just cold.\n\n\n\n\nSign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe sign says "Gourd Lake Nature Park." This place is full of families picnicking on the weekend. It\'s a little cold for picnicking these days, though.December 26Gourd LakePublic BeachPhoenix:\nHaven\'t seen Larry around at all. Probably off paying through the nose on a date with the lovely Kiyance...Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe famous Gourd Lake... Its green waters stretch out on both sides... It\'s a pretty big lake, really.December 26Boat Rental ShopPhoenix:\n(Looks like the boat rental shop is closed today, too.)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShop\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA small boat rental shop. Doesn\'t look like anyone is around. They\'re probably closed because of the murder.\n\n\n\n\nBoats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere are some boats floating at the dock. The murder took place in a boat from this dock... Apparently, the police took away the actual boat that was used that night. Indeed, there\'s space for one more boat at the dock.December 26Gourd Lake WoodsPhoenix:\nHey, Detective Gumshoe!Gumshoe:\nHey, pal! The trial today, it, er... ...Phoenix:\nYes? What about the trial?Gumshoe:\nWell, I was going to say "good show," but it wasn\'t really all that... Though you did save Mr. Edgeworth, I guess... (Changed from [Though you did save Edgeworth, I guess...] in the original release) I just wasn\'t sure how to thank you... you know?Phoenix:\nEr... thanks.Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCamera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nLotta\'s camera is staring out at the lake, as usual. Even a novice like me can tell that camera must cost a pretty penny. I hope she doesn\'t leave it out here to get stolen.\n\n\n\n\nSign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe sign says "No Camping." Funny place to pick to pitch your tent.\n\n\n\n\nCampfire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI wonder why she brought a camping cooker with her? There\'s a convenience store right up the street... I guess she wanted to get into the outdoor spirit.\n\n\n\n\nSUV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI don\'t think Lotta takes very good care of her SUV. It\'s covered with dents. I can\'t believe anyone would drive their car down here.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTomorrow\'s trial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe? Any idea what strategy von Karma is planning for tomorrow?\nGumshoe:\nIt sounds like he\'s bringing in another witness!\nPhoenix:\nAnother witness!? Oh, right, he said something about that in the trial today...\n\n\nKarma:\nThere were two witnesses!\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI was wondering who that other witness was! Er... who was it?\nGumshoe:\nS... sorry, pal. As much as I\'d like to, I\'m not at liberty to divulge that information.\nPhoenix:\n(Right...)\n\n\n\n\nProsecutor Edgeworth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOh, right... I wanted to ask you something about Edgeworth.\nGumshoe:\nWhat\'s up?\nPhoenix:\nIs he afraid of earthquakes? I never heard anything about that before.\nGumshoe:\n... Mr. Edgeworth doesn\'t talk about himself too much, see. But there\'s one thing that\'s clear as day... Him hating crime the way he does... And him becoming a lawyer... And him being scared of earthquakes... It all started with that incident.\nPhoenix:\nThe DL-6 Incident?\nGumshoe:\nYep, that\'s the one. Fifteen years ago... when he saw his father shot before his very eyes! He still feels the pain now, you can see it in his eyes.\n\n\n\n\nMaya Fey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI wanted to talk to you about Maya Fey...\nGumshoe:\nHuh? She\'s not out on bail yet? That\'s strange. I told \'em to let her go as soon as they had their report written up. Man... I don\'t know what would have happened in that courtroom today if it weren\'t for her. Seeing her getting dragged out by the bailiff... I\'ll be honest with you, pal. I shed a tear or two. Mr. Edgeworth, he was so moved I saw his lip trembling. (Changed from [Edgeworth, he was so moved I saw his lip trembling.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nReally!? (Cold-as-ice Edgeworth!?)\nGumshoe:\nHe was really grateful for what she did, you know.Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney\'s Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nI think it\'s a little early for you to be proudly waving that thing around. You can be proud of yourself when you get Mr. Edgeworth declared innocent, pal!\n\n\n\n\nLotta\'s Camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThat woman really took us for a ride, didn\'t she? Claiming she was a witness to a murder and all...\nPhoenix:\nStill, if it weren\'t for her photograph, Mr. Edgeworth wouldn\'t have made it today.\nGumshoe:\nOh, huh, really?\nPhoenix:\n(Umm... you were at the trial, weren\'t you, Detective?)\n\n\n\n\nRobert\'s Autopsy Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nRobert Hammond... He was the defense attorney in the DL-6 Incident trial. He\'s the one who got the sole suspect off the hook. I wonder what Mr. Edgeworth thinks of him. Not much, I\'d wager.\n\n\n\n\nLake Photo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nI don\'t care who you are, no one can tell me that that\'s Mr. Edgeworth! I mean, come on, it doesn\'t look like him at all!\nPhoenix:\nBut Edgeworth has admitted he was on the boat.\nGumshoe:\nThen he\'s the one being shot, then!\nPhoenix:\nHe seemed fine in court today...\nGumshoe:\n... Details, pal, details! Whose side are you on, anyway?\nPhoenix:\n(All I\'m saying is we have to respect the evidence...)\n\n\n\n\nPistol Bullet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nYep, it was fired from the murder weapon, without a doubt.\nPhoenix:\nFrom a meter away... so it would have to have been from someone else on the boat.\nGumshoe:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you make of this, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nHey, making something of things is your job!\nPhoenix:\nEr... right. (Since when do lawyers have to do detectives\' work for them!?)\n\n\n\n\nPistol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nMaybe you should tell me why Mr. Edgeworth\'s prints were on the weapon, pal.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? How should I know!?\n\n\n\n\nLotta\'s Deposition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nNow, she heard two gunshots, right?\nPhoenix:\nBut wait... Look at the Court Record! According to this, the murder weapon was fired three times!\nGumshoe:\nWhat!? How\'s that possible!?\nPhoenix:\nWhere was the third shot fired?\nGumshoe:\nI wonder... Maybe it was a practice shot or something?\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nSorry to disappoint you, pal. I\'m drawing a blank.After clearing all Talk options:Gumshoe:\nI\'m going to head back to the station. I\'ll get the report on Maya and get her out of there as soon as I can.Phoenix:\nThank you. Oh, wait! Umm... I was wondering, how much is bail going to be?Gumshoe:\nDon\'t worry about that. Mr. Edgeworth is posting the whole amount.Phoenix:\nWhat? Edgeworth...?Gumshoe:\nDidn\'t I tell you? He\'s grateful to her for what she did. Alright, pal. Well don\'t forget to go pick her up, okay?Phoenix:\n(Hmm... Maybe I can get Edgeworth to pay this month\'s rent, too...)After clearing all Talk options in Gourd Lake Woods:December 26Detention CenterVisitor\'s RoomMaya:\nHey, Nick! You finally came! They just finished the paperwork, I\'m free to go.Phoenix:\nFree at last, eh?Maya:\nThose interrogators were really mean! They were like "okay, what did you do THIS time?" Like I was some kind of criminal! Can you believe it?Phoenix:\nWell, they let you out in the end, didn\'t they?Maya:\nMmm... Oh, that reminds me... Thanks for bail.Phoenix:\nThank Edgeworth.Maya:\nHuh?Phoenix:\nHe posted bail for you. Said he was grateful for what you did.Maya:\nMr. Edgeworth did that...? ... I have to make it up to him! We\'ve got to win this case, Nick!Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to do\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you think we should do next?\nMaya:\nWe\'re kind of lacking in the clues department. We could go to the park and look for Gourdy.\nPhoenix:\n...\nMaya:\nI-I was kidding!\nPhoenix:\nStill, if there are any clues out there, the park\'s as good a bet as any. What do you say? Shall we head down there?\nMaya:\nSure!\n\n\n\n\nAny ideas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHave you noticed anything lately?\nMaya:\nHmm... You know, I did notice one thing while I was here in detention. It\'s really pretty comfortable here. It\'s warm, and they keep it very clean.\nPhoenix:\nI meant have you noticed anything about the case...?\nMaya:\nWell... Not much more than that, no.\nPhoenix:\n(She\'s probably still upset about Mia. I should leave her alone.)Wright & Co. Law OfficesMaya:\nAhh! Fresh air! I gotta say, freedom feels great.Phoenix:\nBehave yourself in the courtroom tomorrow, okay?Maya:\nHeh heh heh. Misbehaving\'s much more fun.Phoenix:\nIt\'s not going to be so much fun when Edgeworth refuses to pay your bail again.Maya:\n... Right. I\'ll behave.Phoenix:\n(Oh dear...)Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to do\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, what should we do?\nMaya:\nI don\'t know! I\'ve been in detention this whole time. I think I\'ll let you decide what we should do. Deal?\n\n\n\n\nAny ideas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell? Any thoughts you want to share?\nMaya:\nWell, I was detention all day. I think I\'d like more time to think.\nPhoenix:\n(Poor Maya, she probably thought about Mia the whole time she was in there...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nDon\'t waste time showing me things! We have to get cracking on this case! You know the enemy has more tricks up his sleeve! He\'s bringing in another witness!December 26Detention CenterVisitor\'s RoomPhoenix:\nLooks like Edgeworth is in questioning.Maya:\nLet\'s come back later.Phoenix:\nGuess so...December 26Gourd Lake ParkEntranceMaya:\nThere aren\'t many cops around today, are there?Phoenix:\nThey\'re probably back at the precinct, working up the case against Edgeworth.Maya:\nMmm...Lotta:\nHey y\'all!Maya:\nHey, it\'s Lotta!Lotta:\nY\'all really did it today...Phoenix:\nWh-what did we do now?Lotta:\nNaw, I\'m not complaining! See, I did a little thinking. A little... self-reflection, you might say. I realized that bein\' a witness is a mighty big responsibility. But I just went up there and started blabbing any old thing that came to mind.Phoenix:\nLotta...Lotta:\nSo, you see, I want to make it up to y\'all.Phoenix:\n"Make it up"...?Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday\'s trial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat did you think of the trial?\nLotta:\nTo be honest, I was doin\' it half just to say I\'d been a witness... Even though I didn\'t really see anything. I kinda convinced myself I had though... I\'m sorry, I know I caused y\'all a lot of trouble.\nMaya:\nWell, memory is a tricky, vague little thing.\nLotta:\nYeah, I sure know that now. I\'ll be fine the next time I witness a murder!\nMaya:\nRight!\nPhoenix:\n(You mean the FIRST time you witness a murder...)\n\n\n\n\nGourdy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat about Gourdy?\nLotta:\nRight! Well, the way I figure, the trial\'s only stoking the flames of Gourdy fever! I\'ll get my exclusive photos and rocket to stardom!\nMaya:\nAll right, Lotta! You go, girl! I wish I could be an investigative photographer too!\nPhoenix:\n(Finish your spirit medium training first!)\n\n\n\n\nMaking it up\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nLotta, what do you mean by "making it up to us"?\nLotta:\nWell, ya see... Actually, I got a bit of information for you.\nMaya:\nWhat!?\nLotta:\nThat von Karma didn\'t want me to say nothin\' about it.\nMaya:\nWh-what information!?\nLotta:\nNow we\'re getting to the heart of it! See, I reckoned we might be able to do ourselves a little "exchange."\nPhoenix:\nE-"exchange"? Umm... I thought this was to "make it up to us"...?\nLotta:\nRight! I propose a little exchange, to make it up to you!\nPhoenix:\n...\nLotta:\nWhat!? Information don\'t come cheap, my friend!\nMaya:\nUh...\nLotta:\nHey! I see you thinking "my, how unsophisticated these southern folks are"!!! It\'s written all over yer face! Let me tell you, most southerners are WAY more sophisticated than you... I\'m just the exception, okay? Well, what\'ll it be? We gonna deal, or not!?\nMaya:\nWh-what should we do, Nick?\n\n\n\nDeal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(We don\'t have any other leads so I don\'t think we have a choice here...) Okay. How much?\nLotta:\nHuh? You completely off your rocker? I may not be sophisticated, but I\'m not trying to rob the poor!\nLeads to:\n"Huh?"\n\n\n\n\nNo deal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI\'m sorry... But I\'ve no intention of dealing with you!\nMaya:\nNor do we have any money, anyway!\nLotta:\nYou guys make a fine team, you know that? And I can tell you don\'t have any money, just look at those clothes!\nLeads to:\n"Huh?"Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLotta\'s Camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLotta:\nI\'m thinking I should up the sensitivity of my camera mic.

If we didn\'t have that, Edgeworth would be in prison now, or worse!\nMaya:\nThere\'s never a lack of drama when you\'re on a case, is there, Nick?\nLotta:\nWhat, are you always on the verge of horrible failure like this!?\nPhoenix:\nUmm...\nLotta:\nCareful or the stress\'ll send you to an early grave.\nPhoenix:\n(Thanks for the cheerful message of support!)\n\n\n\n\nGourdy Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nUmm... uh... You know, I was wondering...\nLotta:\nYeah?\nMaya:\nWhat if you get a picture of Gourdy... and it turns out like this enlargement did?\nLotta:\nY\'all crazy!? A blurry picture like this doesn\'t make a hit story! I need a picture that screams "I am Gourdy! Hear me roar!" I can\'t turn something like this into the paper! What kind of fool do y\'all think I am?\nPhoenix:\n(The kind of fool that would turn a blurry picture in as evidence in a murder trial? Not to mention claiming she saw something she didn\'t see!)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLotta:\nYep, I\'d have to say I know exactly squat about that.\nPhoenix:\n(It\'s painfully easy to know when something doesn\'t catch Lotta\'s interest...)Phoenix:\nHuh?Lotta:\nThe only fair exchange for information is... information! Listen good-- What I need from you is information about Gourdy!Maya:\nWhoa-whoa-whoa! G-Gourdy!?Phoenix:\nB-but Gourdy doesn\'t... I mean, Gourdy might not exist!Lotta:\nThen bring me proof that shows he don\'t!Phoenix:\nUh...Lotta:\nI\'ll be keepin\' watch from the car, okay? You see something, y\'all come to me first, got it?Phoenix:\nO-okay...Lotta:\nRight! See y\'all later!Phoenix:\n...Maya:\nOkay, Nick, let\'s get hunting!Phoenix:\nH-hunting...? You don\'t seriously mean...Maya:\nGourdy? I sure do!Phoenix:\nWhat about Edgeworth!?Maya:\nWe\'re searching for Gourdy for him, Nick! Don\'t you get it!?Phoenix:\n(Okay... and how exactly do we search for a make-believe monster...? Maybe we can find a monster myth specialist?)December 26Gourd LakePublic BeachPhoenix:\nWh-what\'s that?Maya:\nTh-the Steel Samurai, Nick.Butz:\nYo! Maya!Phoenix:\nLarry! What the heck is that!? (Changed from [Larry! What the heck is this!?] in the original release)Butz:\nOh, it was my girl Kiyance\'s idea... She was all "if you like, put this here, it would be, like, really cool!" Dude, she gave it to me along with the banner!Maya:\nWow! That\'s really impressive she could find those for you!Butz:\nWell, she knows a lot of people. And that show\'s finished now, so she got \'em for free.Phoenix:\nRight...Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlags\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThose flags look sadly out of place here. Flapping listlessly back and forth in a cold wind under a cold sky...\nMaya:\nI dunno, I think it kind of gives the place a festival atmosphere. It reminds me of the "War of the Eyeglasses"!\nPhoenix:\n...? The war of the what!?\nMaya:\nHuh? What? You mean, you don\'t know the War of the Eyeglasses?\nPhoenix:\nWhat the heck is it?\nMaya:\nOur local fair used to do it ever summer... Huh, I guess we were the only ones.\nPhoenix:\n(I ask again, what the heck is it!?)\n\n\n\n\nSteel Samurai inflatable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nDoesn\'t that Steel Samurai look a little out of place? I mean, it\'s so huge... I guess it\'s good advertising.\nMaya:\n... Something about this Steel Samurai just doesn\'t work for me.\nPhoenix:\nHuh? Really? It looks pretty well made to me.\nMaya:\nHmph. Still a novice, aren\'t you, Nick. Really... True connoisseurs like Cody and me don\'t fall for this kind of stuff.\nPhoenix:\n(These Steel Samurai fans are obviously in a league of their own...)\n\n\n\n\nCompressor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nWhat\'s this machine?\nButz:\nThat? That\'s a compressor. I use it to fill up that balloon there with air.\nMaya:\nHuh, neat.\nButz:\nJust got it repaired yesterday! Man, what a drag that was.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdgeworth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButz:\nYo, Nick! What happened with Edgeworth?\nPhoenix:\nWell, we made it through the first day in court all right... I don\'t know how good our prospects are from here on, though.\nButz:\nHuh.\nMaya:\nHey, Larry, did you know Edgeworth\'s secret weakness? He\'s terrified of earthquakes!

I\'ll give you your info, like I promised.\nMaya:\nPoor Lotta...\nAdds "Case information" Talk option\n\n\n\n\nPresent anything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLotta:\n... Hah! All that fancy talk about lawyers and proof had me going for a second there! Y\'all better take a good hard look at that badge of yours and consider a career change!\nPhoenix:\n(Great, the "investigative photographer" is giving me career advice...)\nLeads back to Talk options\n\n\n\n\n\nIs out there somewhere\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI don\'t have it yet, but my lawyer instincts tell me the proof is out there.\nLotta:\nHah! Nice try, but y\'all can\'t pull the wool over these eyes that easy!\nMaya:\nThat won\'t work in court either, Nick...\nPhoenix:\n(Great, now they\'re both mad at me.)\nLeads back to Talk options\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase information (appears after correctly presenting Air Tank upon selecting "Gourdy" Talk option)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n"So, tell us this "information" you have."Phoenix:\nSo, tell us this "information" you have.Lotta:\nA promise is a promise, I guess... I overheard the cops around here saying something about the witness tomorrow... They said he\'s the caretaker of the boat rental place up the path here.Maya:\nBoat rental...? There\'s someone there? I mean, it looks so deserted.Lotta:\nJust an old guy, living all by himself. Y\'all should go check it out.Maya:\nThanks, Lotta! We will! Let\'s get cracking, Nick!Lotta:\nHold on.Phoenix:\nSomething else?Lotta:\nYeah... the night of the murder. My camera clicked twice, you know.Maya:\n...! Wait... so you have another photo?Lotta:\nWell... Yeah, but there\'s nothing in it at all. Just the lake. I figured it wouldn\'t be much use as evidence, so I kept it to myself. Well, it might not be helpful at all, but... Here, take it.Second Lake Photo added to the Court Record.Lotta:\nBye now. Y\'all take care. Time for me to pack up and leave.Maya:\n... Poor Lotta...Phoenix:\nIt\'s all Larry\'s fault. The legend still lives on, I guess.Maya:\nThe "legend"...?Phoenix:\nYeah, the legend of Larry, familiar to all who know him for any length of time... "When something smells, it\'s usually the Butz."Maya:\nHmm. Someone should whip that Butz into shape.December 26Boat Rental ShopMaya:\nHey, Nick! This is the boat shop that Lotta was talking about!Phoenix:\nYou\'re right. Doesn\'t seem to be anyone around at all.Maya:\nWell, let\'s go check it out anyway!December 26Caretaker\'s ShackUncle:\nMeg! That you!?Maya:\nEeeek!Uncle:\nHey, is that Keith with you!?

Hello!" *squawk*Maya:\nN-Nick! What was that!?Phoenix:\nA parrot... the one on the perch.Uncle:\nKeith!Phoenix:\nY-yes!?Uncle:\nI leave the "Wet Noodle" in your capable hands, sonny.Maya:\nN-Nick? What\'s the "Wet Noodle"?Phoenix:\nUm, based on the available evidence, I\'d say it\'s the name of his pasta shop.Uncle:\nThat\'s a relief, isn\'t it, Polly?Parrot:\n"Hello! Hello!" *squawk*Uncle:\nAyup... ... *Zzzzz*Maya:\nHe fell asleep...Phoenix:\nI guess he\'s relieved.Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStove\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nLooks like a kitchen unit.

He\'s running a pasta shop, here!\n\n\n\n\nFish pictures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWow, there\'s lots of various fish in Gourd Lake, aren\'t there!\nMaya:\n...? Something\'s funny, Nick.

Looks warm! That\'s a great idea, we should do that at the office.

Eh? Little Terry was just here.Phoenix:\n"Terry"...?Uncle:\nAyup, that kid next door. You always used to make him cry, remember? He was wearin\' this tattered old coat. Got himself some whiskers growing out of his face.Phoenix:\n(He must be talking about Detective Gumshoe...)Uncle:\nHe comes up and tells me to come down to court tomorrow.Maya:\nReally...?Phoenix:\n(Somehow I don\'t think we\'re going to get much useful information out of this guy.)

Who could that old man be...? I think I need to do a little more research on this DL-6 Incident...

How\'d you-- Hmm. That was supposed to be top secret.\nMaya:\nDo you know who that old man is, Detective?\nGumshoe:\n... Actually... I don\'t. He\'s a bit of an odd bird... I haven\'t been able to get a straight answer out of him. I decided first that he wasn\'t persuasive enough to stand and testify as a witness. That\'s why we called Ms. Lotta Hart yesterday. As for who he is... We have absolutely no idea.\nMaya:\nHmm... sounds suspicious!\nGumshoe:\nHmm...\n\n\n\n\nThe DL-6 Incident\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nDetective Gumshoe, please, help us...\nGumshoe:\nH-huh?\nPhoenix:\nWe need to know about the DL-6 Incident!\nGumshoe:\n...!\nPhoenix:\nThat was when Edgeworth\'s father died. I can\'t help but think that it has something to do with this current case.\nGumshoe:\n... To tell the truth, I don\'t know much about DL-6 either. Mr. Edgeworth forbade us from reading the file. So... I\'m afraid I can\'t show them to you, either, pal.\nMaya:\nWhat!?\nGumshoe:\nHowever... If you can convince me somehow that the DL-6 Incident is related to this case... Well, I guess I\'d consider opening the file up.Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetal Detector\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThanks, Detective Gumshoe.

Have we forgotten something?\nParrot:\n*squawk* "Don\'t forget DL-6!" *squawk*\nMaya:\nH-huh!?\n\n\nPhoenix:\nI\'m pretty sure that old man must have taught her that word...\nGumshoe:\nYeah, but how would that old man know about the DL-6 Incident?\nPhoenix:\nWait! What if... What if that old man was connected to DL-6?\nMaya:\nN-Nick! You think he might be!?\nGumshoe:\n...After clearing all Talk options and presenting Parrot:Gumshoe:\n... I get ya. Sounds like you need information on the DL-6 Incident. Through there is the Station\'s Records Room. I\'ll give you special permission to go in and find what you need.Maya:\nAll right! Way to go, Detective Gumshoe! Okay, Nick! To the Records Room!Phoenix:\n(I guess it\'s time we faced Edgeworth\'s past...)December 26Police DepartmentRecords RoomMaya:\nWow!!! It\'s amazing.........ly dusty.Phoenix:\nTen years of files and ten years of dust, I guess.Maya:\nLet\'s find that DL-6 stuff quick!Phoenix:\n(Fifteen years ago... both me and Edgeworth were nine years old. We were almost through with fourth grade when he suddenly transferred. Because of DL-6...?)Maya:\nNick! I found out where the file is!Phoenix:\nO-oh, thanks!Maya:\nJust let me know what you want to know about the DL-6 Incident! I\'ll go get the right file!Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlass case\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like there are files inside that glass case. The case is so dusty I can\'t see what\'s inside.\nMaya:\nNick... it\'s locked.\nPhoenix:\nThey must keep important case files in there.\n\n\n\n\nBack wall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere are shelves stuffed with case files in the back of the room, too. Forgotten cases, rotting away for eternity...\nMaya:\nNick, let\'s get what we need and get out of here. All this dust is getting to me!\n\n\n\n\nCabinet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThis cabinet is where they keep evidence for current cases. Some of the things are obviously murder weapons. Others are... who knows what. Most of it just looks like random junk.\nMaya:\nNick... what do you think this clothespin is for?\nPhoenix:\nDon\'t touch that! It\'s evidence...\n\n\n\n\nShelves\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHere are files of collected case reports. There\'s quite a large volume of reports here.\nMaya:\nWow... these are all case reports!?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. It\'s like a graveyard of police cases.\nMaya:\nI guess my sister\'s case report is in here too... quietly gathering dust.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe case summary\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, first I have to get a handle on the main facts... like a summary.\nMaya:\nRight. Summary... summary... Found it! Here you go.\nPhoenix:\nDecember 28... 2001.\nMaya:\nThat\'s exactly 15 years ago from the day after tomorrow!\nPhoenix:\n(So in two days, the case is closed...) The incident took place in the elevator of the district courthouse. (Changed from [The incident took place in the elevator of the district court.] in the original release)\nMaya:\nWhat!? Is this the same district courthouse where we\'re holding the trial now!? (Changed from [Is this the same district court where we\'re holding the trial now!?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nLooks like it. There was a large earthquake at 2:00 PM on that day. Part of the court building collapsed, and all of the lights went out.\nMaya:\nWow... that was some earthquake!\nPhoenix:\nAt the time, three people were trapped in the elevator. It took five hours for them to be rescued... Five hours!\nMaya:\nThat would be scary like that, in the dark!\nPhoenix:\nThere was a lack of oxygen in the elevator, and the survivors were unconscious.\nMaya:\nThe survivors...?\nPhoenix:\nOne of the three in the elevator had been shot... in the heart.\nMaya:\nThat was Mr. Edgeworth\'s father... wasn\'t it.\nPhoenix:\n(He said that his father was shot before his very eyes... So Miles Edgeworth was one of the other passengers in that elevator.)\n\n\n\n\nVictim data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nDo you have data on the victim... Edgeworth\'s father?\nMaya:\nYeah, hold on... Victim... victim... Here! Found it!\nPhoenix:\nGregory Edgeworth, 35, defense attorney. If he were still alive, he\'d be 50. He had lost that day\'s case in court, and got in the elevator with his son, Miles.\nMaya:\n"Miles"...!\nPhoenix:\nMiles Edgeworth, of course.\nMaya:\nSo he was on the elevator with his father!\nPhoenix:\nFrom the angle of the bullet and the other evidence, it could not have been a suicide... The murder weapon, a pistol, was found in the elevator. The pistol had been fired two times. (Where have I heard that before...? Huh...! It sounds just like this current case! What\'s going on here?)\n\n\n\n\nSuspect data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nGot any data on the suspect in there?\nMaya:\nHmm... that would be the guy that my mom got arrested. Hold on... this is it.\nPhoenix:\nThe man arrested as a suspect in DL-6 was... Yanni Yogi? He was a clerk in the court, apparently.\nMaya:\nSo he must have been the third person in the elevator. Well, then he had to have done it!\nPhoenix:\nBut... he was found innocent. Thanks to his defense lawyer, Robert Hammond.\nMaya:\nHammond... the victim in our case!\nPhoenix:\nRight. The suspect, Mr. Yogi was oxygen deprived... so much so he had brain damage. He lost all memory of being in the elevator. After he was declared innocent, he disappeared.\nMaya:\nHmm... where could Yogi have gone to, I wonder?\nPhoenix:\n(He may be closer than we think...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nLet\'s just hurry up and read these files! This place is so dusty, I want to finish up and get out of here...After clearing all Talk options:Phoenix:\nI guess I know generally what happened in DL-6 now. I still don\'t know what sort of impact the whole thing had on Edgeworth...Maya:\nNick. Are we going to take the whole file? There\'s too much! We\'ll never get it out.Phoenix:\nY-you\'re right. How about we just take what we think we\'ll need...DL-6 Case File added to the Court Record.Phoenix:\nRight. That\'s probably all we\'ll be able to find here. Now, all that\'s left is the trial tomorrow... I wonder how "Dad" will do testifying in court...To be continued.Nothing to examine during investigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nNo clues here.Turnabout Goodbyes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTranscriptPart 1\n\nPart 2\n\nPart 3\n\nPart 4\n\nPart 5\n\nPart 6December 27, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Miles Edgeworth.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Karma:\n... ...Judge:\nVery well, apparently the prosecution is also ready.Phoenix:\n(Who is the judge here, anyway!?)Judge:\nMr. von Karma, your opening statement.Karma:\n... ...Judge:\nEr... very well, no opening statement so...Karma:Karma:\nNot so fast, Judge! I was taking a meaningful pause before speaking!Judge:\nR-right, of course.Karma:\nA prediction! Today\'s trial will end three minutes from now!Judge:\nOrder... order! Mr. von Karma! What is the meaning of your statement just now!?Karma:Karma:\nBah! Must you question everything! It will be over in three minutes! We have no time to waste! I\'ll call my witness now!Judge:\nR-right...Karma:\nI call my witness... my decisive witness to the stand!Phoenix:\n(It\'s that mysterious boat shop owner.)Karma:\nWitness... state your profession.Uncle:\nMmph... zzzz... ... I, er, am the proprietor of the restaurant the "Wet Noodle" at Gourd Lake.Karma:\n...Uncle:\nAnd I, er, also rent boats.Karma:\nThe night of the incident, you were in the boat rental shop, correct?Uncle:\nEr... ayup, yup I was.Karma:\nPlease testify.Phoenix:\n(Wait a second... We still haven\'t heard who this old guy is!)Raise an objection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n"Wait a minute!"Let it slide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(On second thought, I guess it doesn\'t really matter.)\nMaya:\nDoesn\'t matter!? What are you thinking, Nick!? What if that old man had something to do with the DL-6 Incident? If we don\'t find out who he is, we won\'t be able to build a case here!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, she has a point.)\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n"Wait a minute!"Phoenix:\nWait a minute! The witness hasn\'t stated his name yet!Karma:Karma:\nBecause I did not ask him, Mr. Wright! Bah! I have predicted this trial will end in three minutes! Stop asking trivial questions and cooperate!Phoenix:\n(Yeah, right!)Judge:\nThe witness will state his name.Uncle:\nZzzz... ... Mmph! Well, er... I\'m not really sure, ayup.Judge:\nWhat do you mean?Uncle:\nMy, er, memory...Karma:\nYour Honor... The witness does not remember anything beyond the last several years... Ergo, he cannot recall his own name.Judge:\nHmm... he can\'t recall, you say?Karma:\nYes, but the incident in question took place three days ago. He can testify.Judge:\nVery well. Let\'s hear his testimony then, shall we. Witness?Witness Testimony-- The Night of the Murder --Uncle:\nIt was the night of the 24th, just after midnight, ayup.\nI was in the restaurant... where I er... rent boats, as usual.\nThen I heard a "bang!" Ayup.\nWhen I looked out the window, I saw a boat just a\' floating on the lake.\nThen I heard another "bang."\nJust about then the boat comes back to the shore, and a man walks by my window.Judge:\nHmm...Very well. I\'d like to begin the cross-examination...Karma:Karma:\nThere is nothing to question in my witness\'s testimony! Ergo, no need for cross-examination! Besides, there are only 10 seconds left before our three minutes are up! Judge! Your verdict, now!Judge:\nEr... yes... M-Mr. Wright...?Cross-examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat are you saying!? Of course I\'ll cross-examine the witness!\nJudge:\nHmm... Very well, you may begin.\nLeads to:\n"Raaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!"Don\'t cross-examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(He\'s right. That testimony sounded pretty solid. Maybe I should hold back.)\nMaya:\nB-but, Nick! You have to cross-examine him! This is your only chance to turn this trial around! Your last chance!\nPhoenix:\n(O-oh... right.)\nLeads to:\n"Raaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!"Karma:\nRaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!Judge:\nE-excuse me? Mr. von Karma?Karma:\nThree minutes just passed.Judge:\nI see. Well then, let\'s just take our time. You may cross-examine the witness.Cross Examination-- The Night of the Murder --Uncle:\nIt was the night of the 24th, just after midnight, ayup.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n"Just after midnight," you say?\nUncle:\nAyup, just around then.\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure?\nUncle:\nPretty sure, ayup.\nPhoenix:\nWhen I talked to you yesterday, you were rather vague about the time... I\'m surprised you seem so sure about it today.\nUncle:\n...\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nI asked him, and he remembered. Isn\'t that right!?\nUncle:\nZzzz... D-don\'t glare at me like that...! I, er... I remembered it clearly, I did. Ayup.\nKarma:\nYou see? Continue!Uncle:\nI was in the restaurant... where I er... rent boats, as usual.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nIs there anyone who can verify that?\nUncle:\n... Well, I guess Polly could.\nPhoenix:\nTh-that\'s not good enough for a court of law!\nJudge:\nMr. Wright... exactly what\'s not good enough?\nPhoenix:\nAh, uh, Your Honor, this "Polly" is a parrot.\nJudge:\nA... parrot?\nUncle:\nDon\'t be so hard on the girl, Keithy-boy!\nJudge:\nKeith...?\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nThe prosecution concedes that we cannot prove the witness was in the shop. Witness... please continue.Uncle:\nThen I heard a "bang!" Ayup.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAnd where did the "bang" seem to come from?\nUncle:\nFrom the lake, I figure.\nKarma:\nAre you certain?\nUncle:\nA-ayup.\nKarma:\nGood. Continue!Uncle:\nWhen I looked out the window, I saw a boat just a\' floating on the lake.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWas there someone in the boat?\nUncle:\nIt was pretty far out there... I couldn\'t see clearly... But I figure there was two men out there, ayup.\nPhoenix:\nBut you couldn\'t see them clearly!\nUncle:\nAyup... at the time, that is.\nPhoenix:\n(At the time...?)Uncle:\nThen I heard another "bang."Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo you heard two gunshots total?\nUncle:\nAyup.\nPhoenix:\n(That\'s what Lotta said in her testimony yesterday.)Uncle:\nJust about then the boat comes back to the shore, and a man walks by my window.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n"By your window"?\nUncle:\nAyup, by my window. Right outside the window of my little shack.\nPhoenix:\nAnd, could you see the man\'s face?\nUncle:\nWell, the fog was pretty darn thick, but he was right there in front of me. I saw him.\nJudge:\nThis is rather important detail! Please add it to your testimony.\nUncle:\n...\nKarma:\nTsk, tsk, tsk...\nPhoenix:\n(I have a bad feeling about this...)\nAdds statement "That man was the defendant... he was saying "I can\'t believe he\'s dead."Uncle:\nThat man was the defendant... he was saying "I can\'t believe he\'s dead."Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n"A-are you sure!?"Phoenix:\n(If I know von Karma, he spent time preparing his witness. I\'m not going to find contradictions very easily in this testimony. Whew... it\'s tough being a lawyer.)Phoenix:\nA-are you sure!?Uncle:\n...Phoenix:\n(Uh oh!) D-Dad!Uncle:\nDead certain, Keith! He said "I can\'t believe he\'s dead" as he was walking by, too.Karma:\nWitness! Are you sure that the person you saw was Miles Edgeworth!?Uncle:\nIt was him! That Edgeworth boy!Judge:\n... This... sounds like decisive evidence indeed. I see no room for doubt.Phoenix:\n(von Karma... He lured me into cross-examining so he could set me up for a fall!)Karma:\nTsk, tsk, tsk...Maya:\nN-Nick...! I don\'t like the way things are going here! Everyone in the courtroom is glaring at us!Phoenix:\n(I\'d better act quick, or this trial is going to be over!)Raise an objection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! We proved in yesterday\'s court that it could not have been Edgeworth who fired the gun!\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nMr. Wright. Are you referring to the fingerprints from Edgeworth\'s right hand found on the gun, and the photograph showing a man firing with his left hand...?\nPhoenix:\nExactly!\nKarma:\nThat is easily explainable! He could have wiped his prints after he fired! You are ignoring the truth of the matter here! Everything in this witness\'s testimony is true!\nLeads to:\n"Hmm..."Wait and see what happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(But... how can I raise an objection without any proof?)\nKarma:\nJudge! There is no room for doubt in the witness\'s testimony! I demand that you declare your verdict!\nLeads to:\n"Hmm..."Judge:\nHmm...Phoenix:\n(The judge is lost in thought... what should I do?)Raise an objection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYour Honor! This witness claims that Edgeworth said "I can\' t believe he\'s dead"... But his word is all we have! If he were telling a lie...\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nMr. Wright. In a court of law, the evidence tells all. Apparently, you have yet to realize even this basic fact. If you say his testimony is a lie, show us proof!\nPhoenix:\nUrk...\nMaya:\nNick! Do we have evidence...?\nLeads to:\n"It\'s no good! There\'s nothing I can do."Wait and see what happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I can\'t see any room to raise an objection... I\'d better hold back and see how things develop.)\nMaya:\nNick! We have to do something! If we stay quiet now, Mr. Edgeworth\'ll be found guilty for sure!\nLeads to:\n"It\'s no good! There\'s nothing I can do."Phoenix:\nIt\'s no good! There\'s nothing I can do.Maya:\nA... are you sure?Phoenix:\nTo be honest... I don\'t know what to do anymore.Maya:\nPlease... Can you hear me, Sis? Please... We need your help... Nick needs you...Karma:\nTsk tsk tsk... Three minutes was perhaps too high an expectation. However, fifteen minutes isn\'t bad! This must be a new record.Judge:\nEnough! The witness may leave the stand.Uncle:\nZzzz...Judge:\nThis court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts.Phoenix:\n(W-what!? No!)Karma:\nHmph.Judge:\nThis court find the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth...GuiltyJudge:\nThe accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today\'s date. That is all. The court is adjourned!W-w-waaaaaaait!Judge:\nWh-who was that just now?Me!!!Phoenix:\nHuh? Waaaaah! L-Larry!Judge:\nWh-what are you doing here!?Butz:\nListen! Y-you gotta listen to me! I... I was...  I was there, in the park, the night of the murder! I... I wasn\'t sure about it until just yesterday. B-but today I remembered it!Judge:\nRemembered what?Butz:\nThe gunshot! I heard it too!Judge:\nO-order!Karma:Karma:\nWhat is the meaning of this!? The verdict has been decided! I call for adjournment!Judge:\nOne moment, Mr. von Karma. So, you say you heard a gunshot?Butz:\nYeah, I did! A gunshot! That night! I was sitting here in the audience, listening to the testimony... Then I realized, something he said was different from what I remember! A-anyhow, I can\'t just sit here and let you call Edgey a murderer! It\'s... It\'s just not right! I\'ll testify! Lemme testify!Judge:\nOrder! Order! Well, this is the first time something has happened like this in my court. I\'m not quite sure how to proceed...Karma:\nJudge! You\'ve already given your decision! The trial is over!Maya:\nNick! This is it! Larry\'s given us one final chance at this!Phoenix:\n(She\'s right! If only it wasn\'t Larry... He could make things even worse...)Maya:\nMr. Edgeworth was just declared guilty, Nick! It doesn\'t get any worse!Phoenix:\nYou\'re right! Okay! Your Honor! If there is another witness, it is our duty to hear him speak! Right here! Right now!Karma:\nA waste of time! The verdict cannot be overturned!Judge:\nHmm... ... ... Allow me to speak my opinion. In all court proceedings, it is our duty to prevent an inaccurate verdict. In order to make sure no mistake has been made, every witness should be heard!Karma:\nWh-what is this!?Judge:\nI withdraw my previous verdict of "guilty"! Mr. von Karma! I order you to call this new witness to testify. Now!Karma:\nWhaaaat!Judge:\nThe court will adjourn for a five minute recess. After that, we will hear this new witness. Court is adjourned!December 27, 10:28 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2Phoenix:\nWhew... That was too close. Sorry to keep you on the edge of your seat like that, Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\nHmph. I\'ve seen worse.Phoenix:\n(Yeah right, Edgeworth. You\'re sweating bullets!) I just wonder what Larry plans to say in there.Maya:\nLarry was at the lake that night?Phoenix:\nYes... He said he went looking for the Steel Samurai balloon that flew into the lake.Maya:\nOh right. And he found the balloon and the air tank that night?Phoenix:\nYeah.Edgeworth:\n...Phoenix:\nHey, Edgeworth.Edgeworth:\n... Huh? You say something, Wright?Phoenix:\nYeah, a lot of things. You seem out of it. What\'s wrong?Edgeworth:\nIt... it\'s nothing.Phoenix:\nHmm?Maya:\nUmm... Mr. Edgeworth? There\'s something I\'ve been meaning to ask you.Edgeworth:\nWhat\'s that?Maya:\nWhy are your fingerprints on the murder weapon?Edgeworth:\nOh. When he fell into the lake, I went into a daze. I couldn\'t understand what had happened. I couldn\'t think straight. Then I saw the pistol lying on the floor of the boat in front of me. I picked it up without thinking. I didn\'t have a reason, really.Maya:\nI see...Edgeworth:\nWright...Phoenix:\nYeah?Edgeworth:\nThis might be our chance.Phoenix:\nOur chance?Edgeworth:\nvon Karma has only ever run perfect trials.Phoenix:\nPerfect trials...?Edgeworth:\nPerfectly prepared witnesses, perfectly complete evidence. That\'s the secret to his success. This is the first time he\'s ever had to deal with something unexpected! He has to let someone he hasn\'t even talked to testify before the court! (Changed from [He has let someone he hasn\'t even talked to testify before the court!] in the original release) And that someone... is Larry!Phoenix:\nWhat are you getting at?Edgeworth:\nIt\'s likely his testimony will be full of holes, Wright.Maya:\nThat\'s right, Nick! No ten minute trial this time! We\'ll milk this one for all it\'s worth!Phoenix:\nHey, it was fifteen minutes! Fifteen! (Everything\'s on Larry now...) (Changed from [Hey, it was fifteen minutes! Fifteen! (Everything depends on Larry now...)] in the original release)December 27, 10:35 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:\nCourt is now back in session. Witness... Please testify to the court about everything that you saw... on the night of December 24th.Butz:\nRight... leave it to me!Phoenix:\n(Please, Larry, don\'t mess this one up!!! I hate to admit it, but you\'re our last chance!)Karma:\n...Phoenix:\n(von Karma didn\'t even have time to prep his witness. I just hope Edgeworth is right about this being our big break...)Witness Testimony-- The Night of the Murder --Butz:\nThat night, I was out in a boat on the lake.\nI was looking for something and I, er, found it.\nSo I quietly slipped the boat back in at the rental shop dock.\nThen, just as I was thinking about going home, I heard this "bang"!\nI looked out over the lake, but I didn\'t notice the boat.\nSo after I heard that single gunshot I went home.Judge:\nHmm... That was an unusually vague testimony, even for this court. In any matter, Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor...Maya:\nWhat\'s wrong, Nick?Phoenix:\nIt\'s Larry! I have no idea what he\'s going to say if I press him. I\'m a little scared.Maya:\nHmm... Well, we\'ve come this far. There\'s no way to go but forward, Nick!Cross Examination-- The Night of the Murder --Butz:\nThat night, I was out in a boat on the lake.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n...\nJudge:\nSomething wrong, Mr. Wright?\nPhoenix:\nThere were so many things wrong I don\'t know where to begin...\nJudge:\nAh...\nPhoenix:\nUm, well, okay. First of all, what time was it?\nButz:\nOh, it was after 11:00 when I went out in the boat. By that time everyone had gone home for the night. So I waited until the coast was clear, so to speak.\nPhoenix:\nAnd why were you out on a boat at such a late hour...?Butz:\nI was looking for something and I, er, found it.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n"Looking for something"...?\nButz:\nEr, yeah.\nJudge:\nMr. Butz, what was it you were looking for?\nKarma:\n\nKarma:\nWhat the witness was searching for is irrelevant! Most likely he was hunting for this "Gourdy"!\nPhoenix:\n(You know, it wouldn\'t surprise me one bit if that was the truth.)\nKarma:\nThis is all irrelevant! Let\'s get it over with.Butz:\nSo I quietly slipped the boat back in at the rental shop dock.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAround what time was that?\nButz:\nUh... Well, let\'s see... I figured I was out searching for about an hour... I guess it was around 12:00. Yeah.\nJudge:\nYou\'re not sure?\nButz:\nHey! Don\'t give me that face! I\'m not some sort of human sundial, okay!?\nPhoenix:\n(People use watches these days, Larry...)Butz:\nThen, just as I was thinking about going home, I heard this "bang"!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhere did the sound come from?\nButz:\nYeah, well, I wasn\'t too sure about that. I looked around, y\'know.\nJudge:\nDid you look at the lake?\nButz:\nYeah, I looked.Butz:\nI looked out over the lake, but I didn\'t notice the boat.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWasn\'t there a boat on the lake!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order! Well? Mr. Butz!\nButz:\nWhoa, whoa. Everybody just calm down, okay? I mean, it was real foggy that night. I\'m not sure whether there was a boat out there or not.\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, okay, no problem. That\'s just the MOST IMPORTANT PART of the case!!!)\nKarma:\nHmph!Butz:\nSo after I heard that single gunshot I went home.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, you only heard one "bang" correct?\nButz:\nYeah.\nPhoenix:\n(Huh.)Present Lotta\'s Deposition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n"W-wait a sec, Larry!"Maya:\nWell, Nick?Phoenix:\nHmm... It was a pretty wishy-washy testimony, wasn\'t it? I guess I should just start working on the contradictions.Maya:\nSorry...\nI wish I could be more helpful. I wish I could call my sister...Phoenix:\nW-wait a sec, Larry!Butz:\nWh-what!?Phoenix:\nYou only heard one "bang"!? You\'re sure!?Butz:\nThat\'s what I said!Phoenix:\nBut Mr. Lotta Hart testified yesterday that she heard two "bang"s! And the old man just now said the same thing! They both heard two gunshots that night!Butz:\nHuh?Phoenix:\nWere you even listening!? Were you paying attention at all to what they said?Butz:\nYo, Nick, please!Phoenix:\nHuh?Butz:\nYou know, something\'s been bothering me. I\'m a witness, see? I\'m like a customer here! So you got to treat me nice and stuff, okay!?Phoenix:\n...Judge:\nMr. Butz.Butz:\nWhat!?Judge:\nYou only heard one gunshot? Are you sure?Butz:\n... Umm... Well, to tell ya the truth... I\'m not sure.Judge:\nEh...?Phoenix:\nNot sure!? H-how could you not be sure?Butz:\nYeah, well... I, uh, I might have missed the other gunshot. I was, uh, listening to something else...Phoenix:\nSomething... else?Butz:\nMy radio, dude! With my headphones. (Changed from [My radio, dude! On my headphones.] in the original release)Phoenix:\nWhaaaaaaat!?Judge:\nOrder! Order! And stop that booing! M-Mr. Butz! You were listening to the radio with your headphones? (Changed from [You were listening to a radio on earphones?] in the original release)Butz:\nY-yeah! So what! That a crime!? I listen to my radio! Everybody listens to the radio! What\'s the big deal!?Judge:\nHmm... Mr. von Karma... your opinion?Karma:\nWaste of time. I do not accept this witness, nor his shoddy testimony.Judge:\nHmm... Well, Mr. Wright? Should he continue the testimony?That\'s enough\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, I think I\'ve heard enough. This is all too embarrassing... In fact, I think we\'ve all heard enough.)\nMaya:\nWhat are you saying, Nick!? If you stop now, Mr. Edgeworth will be found guilty! We have to turn this trial around now!\nPhoenix:\nUh...\nLeads to:\n"Your Honor."Continue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n"Your Honor."Phoenix:\nYour Honor. Please... please allow the witness to continue his testimony.Karma:\nBah! Nothing is more pitiful than a lawyer who doesn\'t know when he\'s lost!Judge:\nVery well, Mr. Butz. Please give your testimony, and be sure to include details like your RADIO.Butz:\nRight! Leave it to me!Phoenix:\n(I wouldn\'t if there were any other way out of this, believe me.)Witness Testimony-- What Larry Heard --Butz:\nIt\'s lonely, being alone on Christmas Eve!\nThat\'s why I was listening to an all-requests show on the radio, see?\nI was listening to it real booming loud, like.\nBut I\'m sure I heard that gunshot!\nI remember exactly what the DJ was saying when I heard it, too.Judge:\nYou were listening to your radio... at a high volume!?Butz:\nYeah, what\'s the big problem? Can\'t a man listen to his radio in peace? Isn\'t this a free country!?Phoenix:\n(I truly believe Larry has no idea what the problem here is.)Karma:\nJudge. Can you believe a word this witness says? What he heard was probably nothing more than a drum beat from the radio!Judge:\nTrue enough, it is difficult to believe this testimony.Phoenix:Phoenix:\nWait, Your Honor! The witness said he remembers exactly what the DJ said when he heard the gunshot!Judge:\nExcuse me? "Dee-jay"...?Phoenix:\nAn announcer... the guy who says things on the radio. Anyway! What this means is, when he heard the sound, no music was playing! The DJ only talks between songs! So he could have heard the gunshot from the lake! I\'d like to cross-examine the witness, Your Honor!Judge:\nV-very well, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\n(I can\'t believe I\'m continuing this charade...)Cross Examination'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o'}}

I'll make it look like HE did it!August 3, 9:47 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2Phoenix:
(Boy am I nervous!)Mia:
Wright!Phoenix:
Oh, h-hiya, Chief.Mia:
Whew, I'm glad I made it on time. Well, I have to say Phoenix, I'm impressed! Not everyone takes on a murder trial right off the bat like this. It says a lot about you... and your client as well.Phoenix:
Um... thanks. Actually, it's because I owe him a favor.Mia:
A favor? You mean, you knew the defendant before this case?Phoenix:
Yes. Actually, I kind of owe my current job to him. He's one of the reasons I became an attorney.Mia:
Well, that's news to me!Phoenix:
I want to help him out any way I can! I just... really want to help him. I owe him that much.???:
(It's over! My life, everything, it's all over!)Mia:
... Is that your client screaming over there? (Changed from [Isn't that your client screaming over there?] in the original release)Phoenix:
Yeah... it's him. (Changed from [Yeah... that's him.] in the original release)???:
(Death! Despair! Ohhhh! I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna die!!!)Mia:
It sounds like he wants to die...Phoenix:
Um, yeah. *sigh*Butz:
Nick!!!Phoenix:
Hey. Hey there, Larry.Butz:
Dude, I'm so guilty!! Tell them I'm guilty!!! Gimme the death sentence! I ain't afraid to die!Phoenix:
What!? What's wrong, Larry?Butz:
Oh, it's all over... I... I'm finished. Finished! I can't live in a world without her! I can't! Who... who took her away from me, Nick? Who did this!? Aww, Nick, ya gotta tell me! Who took my baby away!?Phoenix:
(Hmm... The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say it was you...)Phoenix:
My name is Phoenix Wright. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: "When something smells, it's usually the Butz." In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!August 3, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz. (Changed from [The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.] in the original release)Payne:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The, um, defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:
Ahem. Mr. Wright? This is your first trial, is it not?Phoenix:
Y-Yes, Your Honor. I'm, um, a little nervous.Judge:
Your conduct during this trial will decide the fate of your client. Murder is a serious charge. For your client's sake, I hope you can control your nerves.Phoenix:
Thank... thank you, Your Honor.Judge:
... Mr. Wright, given the circumstances... I think we should have a test to ascertain your readiness.Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. (Gulp... Hands shaking... Eyesight... fading...)Judge:
This test will consist of a few simple questions. Answer them clearly and concisely. Please state the name of the defendant in this case.Phoenix Wright







Phoenix:
Um... the defendant... is me... right? (Changed from [Um... the defendant... is me, right?] in the original release)
Mia:
Wright! Have you completely lost your mind? Focus! The defendant is the person on trial! You're his lawyer!
Phoenix:
Um, er, eh? Oh yeah, right! Eh heh heh.
Mia:
This is no laughing matter! You did pass the bar, didn't you?
Judge:
Sorry, I couldn't hear your answer. I'll ask once more:
Leads back to:
"Please state the name of the defendant in this case."Larry Butz







Leads to:
"The defendant? Well, that's Larry Butz, Your Honor."Mia Fey







Phoenix:
The, um, defendant? That's... er... Mia Fey?
Mia:
Wrong, Wright. Look, I have to leave. I have to go home. I'm... I'm expecting a delivery.
Phoenix:
Aw, c'mon Chief. There's no need to be going so soon, is there?
Mia:
Listen, Wright! (Changed from [Wright!] in the original release) The defendant is the one on trial--your client! (Changed from [Listen: the defendant is the one on trial--your client!] in the original release) I mean, that's about as basic as you can get!
Phoenix:
(I've put my foot in it this time! I've got to relax!)
Judge:
Sorry, I couldn't hear your answer. I'll ask once more:
Leads back to:
"Please state the name of the defendant in this case."Phoenix:
The defendant? Well, that's Larry Butz, Your Honor.Judge:
Correct. Just keep your wits about you and you'll do fine. Next question: This is a murder trial. Tell me, what's the victim's name?Phoenix:
(Whew, I know this one! Glad I read the case report cover to cover so many times. It's... wait... Uh-oh! No... no way! I forgot! I'm drawing a total blank here!)Mia:
Phoenix! Are you absolutely SURE you're up to this? You don't even know the victim's name!?Phoenix:
Oh, the victim! O-Of course I know the victim's name! I, um, just forgot. ...Temporarily (Changed from [I, um, just forgot. ... Temporarily.] in the original release)Mia:
I think I feel a migraine coming on. Look, the victim's name is listed in the Court Record. Just press [the R Button / Tab] to check it at any time, okay? (Changed from [Just touch the Court Record button to check it at any time, okay?] in the original release) Remember to check it often. Do it for me, please. I'm begging you.Judge:
Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?Mia Fey







Phoenix:
Um... Mia Fey?
Mia:
W-W-What!? How can I be the victim!?
Phoenix:
Oh! Right! Sorry! I, er, it was the first name that popped into my head, and--
Mia:
The Court Record button! Remember to use it when you're in a pinch with [the R Button / Tab]. (Changed from [Remember to use it when you're in a pinch.] in the original release)
Judge:
Let me ask that one again:
Leads back to:
"Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?"Cinder Block







Phoenix:
Oh, um, wasn't it Ms. Block? Ms. Cinder Block?
Judge:
The person in question was a victim of murder, not ill-conceived naming, Mr. Wright.
Mia:
Wright? If you forget something, use [the R Button / Tab] to check the Court Record and jog your memory. (Changed from [If you forget something, [just touch the Court Record button to help you remember.] in the original release) A mistake in court could cost you the case.
Judge:
I'll ask you again:
Leads back to:
"Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?"Cindy Stone







Leads to:
"Um... the victim's name is Cindy Stone."Phoenix:
Um... the victim's name is Cindy Stone.Judge:
Correct. Now, tell me, what was the cause of death? She died because she was...?Poisoned







Phoenix:
Oh, right! Wasn't she, um, poisoned by er... poison?
Judge:
You're asking me!?
Phoenix:
Um... Chief! Help me out!
Mia:
Check the court record. [The R Button / Tab]... remember? (Changed from [Check the court record. The Court Record button... remember?] in the original release)
Phoenix:
(Geez. Give a guy a break!)
Judge:
Let me ask again.
Leads back to:
"She died because she was...?"Hit with a blunt object







Leads to:
"She was struck once, by a blunt object."Strangled







Phoenix:
Right... she was strangled, wasn't she?
Mia:
Please tell me that was you talking to yourself.
Judge:
If you wish to hang yourself, Mr. Wright, you're welcome to, but not inside my courtroom. I suppose there's nothing to do but give you another try:
Leads back to:
"She died because she was...?"Phoenix:
She was struck once, by a blunt object.Judge:
Correct. You've answered all my questions. I see no reason why we shouldn't proceed. You seem much more relaxed, Mr. Wright. Good for you.Phoenix:
Thank you, Your Honor. (Because I don't FEEL relaxed, that's for sure.)Judge:
Well, then... First, a question for the prosecution. Mr. Payne?Payne:
Yes, Your Honor?Judge:
As Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to the court just what that "object" was?Payne:
The murder weapon was this statue of "The Thinker." It was found lying on the floor, next to the victim.Judge:
I see... The court accepts it into evidence. (Changed from [I see... the court accepts it into evidence.] in the original release)Statue added to the Court Record.Mia:
Wright... Be sure to pay attention to any evidence added during the trial. That evidence is the only ammunition you have in court. [Touch the Court Record button / Use the R Button] to check the Court Record frequently.Judge:
Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its first witness.Payne:
The prosecution calls the defendant, Mr. Butz, to the stand.Phoenix:
Um, Chief, what do I do now?Mia:
Pay attention. You don't want to miss any information that might help your client's case. You'll get your chance to respond to the prosecution later, so be ready! Let's just hope he doesn't say anything... unfortunate.Phoenix:
(Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... This could be bad.) (Changed from [Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... this could be bad.] in the original release)Payne:
Ahem. Mr. Butz. Is it not true that the victim had recently dumped you?Butz:
Hey, watch it buddy! We were great together! We were Romeo and Juliet, Cleopatra and Mark Anthony!Phoenix:
(Um... didn't they all die?)Butz:
I wasn't dumped! She just wasn't taking my phone calls. Or seeing me... Ever. WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?Payne:
Mr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by "dumped." In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!Butz:
Whaddya mean, "one of them"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!Payne:
Your Honor, the victim's passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.Passport added to the Court Record.Judge:
Hmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.Butz:
Dude... no way...Payne:
The victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several "Sugar Daddies."Butz:
Daddies? Sugar?Payne:
Yes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.Butz:
Duuude!Payne:
We can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?Mia:
Wright... I don't think you want him to answer that question.Phoenix:
(Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)Wait and see what happens







Phoenix:
(Might be better not to get involved in this one...)
Payne:
Well, Mr. Butz?
Butz:
Dude, no way! That cheatin' she-dog!
Leads to:
"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!"Stop him from answering







Phoenix:
My client had no idea the victim was seeing other men! That question is irrelevant to this case!
Payne:
Oof! *wince*
Butz:
Dude! Nick! Whaddya mean, "irrelevant"!? That cheatin' she-dog!
Leads to:
"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!"Butz:
I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I'm going to get to the bottom of this!Judge:
Let's continue with the trial, shall we?Payne:
I believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.Judge:
Yes, quite.Phoenix:
(Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)Payne:
Next question! You went to the victim's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?Butz:
Gulp!Payne:
Well, did you, or did you not?Butz:
Heh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn't!Phoenix:
(Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)Have him answer honestly







Phoenix:
(I know! I'll send him a signal...)

(TELL THE TRUTH)

Butz:
Er... Yeah! Yeah! I was there! I went!
Judge:
Order! Well, Mr. Butz?
Butz:
Dude, chill! She wasn't home, man... So, like, I didn't see her.
Payne:

Payne:
Your Honor, the defendant is lying.
Judge:
Lying?
Payne:
The prosecution would like to call a witness who can prove Mr. Butz is lying.
Leads to:
"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"Stop him from answering







Phoenix:
(I'll send him a signal...)

(LIE LIKE A DOG)

Butz:
Um, well, see, it's like this: I don't remember.
Payne:
You "don't remember"? Well then, we'll just have to remind you!
Phoenix:
(I got a bad feeling about this...)
Payne:
We have a witness that can prove he DID go to the victim's apartment that day!
Leads to:
"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"Judge:
Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?Payne:
The man who found the victim's body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw the defendant fleeing the scene of the crime!Judge:
Order! Order in the court! Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.Payne:
Yes, Your Honor.Phoenix:
(This is bad...)Payne:
On the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim's building. Please bring Mr. Frank Sahwit to the stand!Payne:
Mr. Sahwit, you sell newspaper subscriptions, is this correct?Sahwit:
Oh, oh yes! Newspapers, yes!Judge:
Mr. Sahwit, you may proceed with your testimony. Please tell the court what you saw on the day of the murder.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Sahwit:
I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.
I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.
Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.
Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!
I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.
I thought to call the police immediately!
However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.
I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.
I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.
The man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Judge:
Hmm...Phoenix:
(Larry! Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!)Judge:
Incidentally, why wasn't the phone in the victim's apartment working?Payne:
Your Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.Judge:
Aren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?Payne:
Yes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.Blackout Record added to the Court Record.Judge:
Now, Mr. Wright...Phoenix:
Yes! Er... yes, Your Honor?Judge:
You may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:
C-Cross-examination, Your Honor?Mia:
Alright, Wright, this is it. The real deal!Phoenix:
Uh... what exactly am I supposed to do?Mia:
Why, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!Phoenix:
Lies! What?! He was lying!?Mia:
Your client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?Phoenix:
!!! How do I prove he's not?Mia:
You hold the key! It's in the evidence! Compare the witness's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there! First, find contradictions between the Court Record and the witness's testimony. Then, once you've found the contradicting evidence... present it and rub it in the witness's face!Phoenix:
Um... okay.Mia:
Open the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab], then point out contradictions in the testimony! (Changed from [Touch the Court Record button and point out contradictions in the testimony!] in the original release)Cross Examination

Answer them clearly and concisely. Please state the name of the defendant in this case.Phoenix Wright\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... the defendant... is me... right?

(Changed from [Wright!] in the original release) The defendant is the one on trial--your client!

Well, that\'s Larry Butz, Your Honor.Judge:\nCorrect. Just keep your wits about you and you\'ll do fine. Next question: This is a murder trial. Tell me, what\'s the victim\'s name?Phoenix:\n(Whew, I know this one! Glad I read the case report cover to cover so many times. It\'s... wait... Uh-oh! No... no way! I forgot! I\'m drawing a total blank here!)Mia:\nPhoenix! Are you absolutely SURE you\'re up to this? You don\'t even know the victim\'s name!?Phoenix:\nOh, the victim! O-Of course I know the victim\'s name! I, um, just forgot. ...Temporarily (Changed from [I, um, just forgot. ... Temporarily.] in the original release)Mia:\nI think I feel a migraine coming on. Look, the victim\'s name is listed in the Court Record. Just press [the R Button / Tab] to check it at any time, okay? (Changed from [Just touch the Court Record button to check it at any time, okay?] in the original release) Remember to check it often. Do it for me, please. I\'m begging you.Judge:\nMr. Wright.

Who is the victim in this case?"Cinder Block\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOh, um, wasn\'t it Ms. Block? Ms. Cinder Block?\nJudge:\nThe person in question was a victim of murder, not ill-conceived naming, Mr. Wright.\nMia:\nWright? If you forget something, use [the R Button / Tab] to check the Court Record and jog your memory.

I suppose there\'s nothing to do but give you another try:\nLeads back to:\n"She died because she was...?"Phoenix:\nShe was struck once, by a blunt object.Judge:\nCorrect. You\'ve answered all my questions. I see no reason why we shouldn\'t proceed. You seem much more relaxed, Mr. Wright. Good for you.Phoenix:\nThank you, Your Honor. (Because I don\'t FEEL relaxed, that\'s for sure.)Judge:\nWell, then... First, a question for the prosecution. Mr. Payne?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nAs Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to the court just what that "object" was?Payne:\nThe murder weapon was this statue of "The Thinker." It was found lying on the floor, next to the victim.Judge:\nI see... The court accepts it into evidence. (Changed from [I see... the court accepts it into evidence.] in the original release)Statue added to the Court Record.Mia:\nWright... Be sure to pay attention to any evidence added during the trial. That evidence is the only ammunition you have in court. [Touch the Court Record button / Use the R Button] to check the Court Record frequently.Judge:\nMr. Payne, the prosecution may call its first witness.Payne:\nThe prosecution calls the defendant, Mr. Butz, to the stand.Phoenix:\nUm, Chief, what do I do now?Mia:\nPay attention. You don\'t want to miss any information that might help your client\'s case. You\'ll get your chance to respond to the prosecution later, so be ready! Let\'s just hope he doesn\'t say anything... unfortunate.Phoenix:\n(Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... This could be bad.) (Changed from [Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... this could be bad.] in the original release)Payne:\nAhem. Mr. Butz. Is it not true that the victim had recently dumped you?Butz:\nHey, watch it buddy! We were great together! We were Romeo and Juliet, Cleopatra and Mark Anthony!Phoenix:\n(Um... didn\'t they all die?)Butz:\nI wasn\'t dumped! She just wasn\'t taking my phone calls. Or seeing me... Ever. WHAT\'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?Payne:\nMr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by "dumped." In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!Butz:\nWhaddya mean, "one of them"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don\'t believe a word of it!Payne:\nYour Honor, the victim\'s passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.Passport added to the Court Record.Judge:\nHmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.Butz:\nDude... no way...Payne:\nThe victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several "Sugar Daddies."Butz:\nDaddies? Sugar?Payne:\nYes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.Butz:\nDuuude!Payne:\nWe can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?Mia:\nWright... I don\'t think you want him to answer that question.Phoenix:\n(Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)Wait and see what happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Might be better not to get involved in this one...)\nPayne:\nWell, Mr. Butz?\nButz:\nDude, no way! That cheatin\' she-dog!\nLeads to:\n"I\'m gonna die. I\'m just gonna drop dead!"Stop him from answering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMy client had no idea the victim was seeing other men! That question is irrelevant to this case!\nPayne:\nOof! *wince*\nButz:\nDude! Nick! Whaddya mean, "irrelevant"!? That cheatin\' she-dog!\nLeads to:\n"I\'m gonna die. I\'m just gonna drop dead!"Butz:\nI\'m gonna die. I\'m just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I\'m going to get to the bottom of this!Judge:\nLet\'s continue with the trial, shall we?Payne:\nI believe the accused\'s motive is clear to everyone.Judge:\nYes, quite.Phoenix:\n(Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)Payne:\nNext question! You went to the victim\'s apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?Butz:\nGulp!Payne:\nWell, did you, or did you not?Butz:\nHeh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn\'t!Phoenix:\n(Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)Have him answer honestly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I know! I\'ll send him a signal...)\n\n(TELL THE TRUTH)\n\nButz:\nEr... Yeah! Yeah! I was there! I went!\nJudge:\nOrder! Well, Mr. Butz?\nButz:\nDude, chill! She wasn\'t home, man... So, like, I didn\'t see her.\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nYour Honor, the defendant is lying.\nJudge:\nLying?\nPayne:\nThe prosecution would like to call a witness who can prove Mr. Butz is lying.\nLeads to:\n"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"Stop him from answering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I\'ll send him a signal...)\n\n(LIE LIKE A DOG)\n\nButz:\nUm, well, see, it\'s like this: I don\'t remember.\nPayne:\nYou "don\'t remember"? Well then, we\'ll just have to remind you!\nPhoenix:\n(I got a bad feeling about this...)\nPayne:\nWe have a witness that can prove he DID go to the victim\'s apartment that day!\nLeads to:\n"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"Judge:\nWell, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?Payne:\nThe man who found the victim\'s body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw the defendant fleeing the scene of the crime!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.Payne:\nYes, Your Honor.Phoenix:\n(This is bad...)Payne:\nOn the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim\'s building. Please bring Mr. Frank Sahwit to the stand!Payne:\nMr. Sahwit, you sell newspaper subscriptions, is this correct?Sahwit:\nOh, oh yes! Newspapers, yes!Judge:\nMr. Sahwit, you may proceed with your testimony. Please tell the court what you saw on the day of the murder.Witness Testimony-- Witness\'s Account --Sahwit:\nI was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.\nI thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.\nThinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.\nThen I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!\nI quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.\nI thought to call the police immediately!\nHowever, the phone in her apartment wasn\'t working.\nI went to a nearby park and found a public phone.\nI remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.\nThe man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Judge:\nHmm...Phoenix:\n(Larry! Why didn\'t you tell the truth? I can\'t defend you against a testimony like that!)Judge:\nIncidentally, why wasn\'t the phone in the victim\'s apartment working?Payne:\nYour Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.Judge:\nAren\'t phones supposed to work during a blackout?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.Blackout Record added to the Court Record.Judge:\nNow, Mr. Wright...Phoenix:\nYes! Er... yes, Your Honor?Judge:\nYou may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:\nC-Cross-examination, Your Honor?Mia:\nAlright, Wright, this is it. The real deal!Phoenix:\nUh... what exactly am I supposed to do?Mia:\nWhy, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!Phoenix:\nLies! What?! He was lying!?Mia:\nYour client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?Phoenix:\n!!! How do I prove he\'s not?Mia:\nYou hold the key! It\'s in the evidence! Compare the witness\'s testimony to the evidence at hand. There\'s bound to be a contradiction in there! First, find contradictions between the Court Record and the witness\'s testimony. Then, once you\'ve found the contradicting evidence... present it and rub it in the witness\'s face!Phoenix:\nUm... okay.Mia:\nOpen the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab], then point out contradictions in the testimony!

(Boy am I nervous!)Mia:
Wright!Phoenix:
Oh, h-hiya, Chief.Mia:
Whew, I'm glad I made it on time. Well, I have to say Phoenix, I'm impressed! Not everyone takes on a murder trial right off the bat like this. It says a lot about you... and your client as well.Phoenix:
Um... thanks. Actually, it's because I owe him a favor.Mia:
A favor? You mean, you knew the defendant before this case?Phoenix:
Yes. Actually, I kind of owe my current job to him. He's one of the reasons I became an attorney.Mia:
Well, that's news to me!Phoenix:
I want to help him out any way I can! I just... really want to help him. I owe him that much.???:
(It's over! My life, everything, it's all over!)Mia:
... Is that your client screaming over there? (Changed from [Isn't that your client screaming over there?] in the original release)Phoenix:
Yeah... it's him. (Changed from [Yeah... that's him.] in the original release)???:
(Death! Despair! Ohhhh! I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna die!!!)Mia:
It sounds like he wants to die...Phoenix:
Um, yeah. *sigh*Butz:
Nick!!!Phoenix:
Hey. Hey there, Larry.Butz:
Dude, I'm so guilty!! Tell them I'm guilty!!! Gimme the death sentence! I ain't afraid to die!Phoenix:
What!? What's wrong, Larry?Butz:
Oh, it's all over... I... I'm finished. Finished! I can't live in a world without her! I can't! Who... who took her away from me, Nick? Who did this!? Aww, Nick, ya gotta tell me! Who took my baby away!?Phoenix:
(Hmm... The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say it was you...)Phoenix:
My name is Phoenix Wright. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: "When something smells, it's usually the Butz." In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!August 3, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz. (Changed from [The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.] in the original release)Payne:

Y-Yes, Your Honor. I'm, um, a little nervous.Judge:
Your conduct during this trial will decide the fate of your client. Murder is a serious charge. For your client's sake, I hope you can control your nerves.Phoenix:
Thank... thank you, Your Honor.Judge:
... Mr. Wright, given the circumstances... I think we should have a test to ascertain your readiness.Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. (Gulp... Hands shaking... Eyesight... fading...)Judge:
This test will consist of a few simple questions. Answer them clearly and concisely. Please state the name of the defendant in this case.Phoenix Wright







Phoenix:
Um... the defendant... is me... right? (Changed from [Um... the defendant... is me, right?] in the original release)
Mia:
Wright! Have you completely lost your mind? Focus! The defendant is the person on trial! You're his lawyer!
Phoenix:
Um, er, eh? Oh yeah, right! Eh heh heh.
Mia:
This is no laughing matter! You did pass the bar, didn't you?
Judge:
Sorry, I couldn't hear your answer. I'll ask once more:

"The defendant? Well, that's Larry Butz, Your Honor."Mia Fey







Phoenix:
The, um, defendant? That's... er... Mia Fey?
Mia:
Wrong, Wright. Look, I have to leave. I have to go home. I'm... I'm expecting a delivery.
Phoenix:
Aw, c'mon Chief. There's no need to be going so soon, is there?
Mia:
Listen, Wright! (Changed from [Wright!] in the original release) The defendant is the one on trial--your client! (Changed from [Listen: the defendant is the one on trial--your client!] in the original release) I mean, that's about as basic as you can get!

Sorry, I couldn't hear your answer. I'll ask once more:
Leads back to:
"Please state the name of the defendant in this case."Phoenix:
The defendant? Well, that's Larry Butz, Your Honor.Judge:
Correct. Just keep your wits about you and you'll do fine. Next question: This is a murder trial. Tell me, what's the victim's name?Phoenix:
(Whew, I know this one! Glad I read the case report cover to cover so many times. It's... wait... Uh-oh! No... no way! I forgot! I'm drawing a total blank here!)Mia:
Phoenix! Are you absolutely SURE you're up to this? You don't even know the victim's name!?Phoenix:
Oh, the victim! O-Of course I know the victim's name! I, um, just forgot. ...Temporarily (Changed from [I, um, just forgot. ... Temporarily.] in the original release)Mia:
I think I feel a migraine coming on. Look, the victim's name is listed in the Court Record. Just press [the R Button / Tab] to check it at any time, okay? (Changed from [Just touch the Court Record button to check it at any time, okay?] in the original release) Remember to check it often. Do it for me, please. I'm begging you.Judge:
Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?Mia Fey







Phoenix:
Um... Mia Fey?
Mia:
W-W-What!? How can I be the victim!?
Phoenix:
Oh! Right! Sorry! I, er, it was the first name that popped into my head, and--
Mia:
The Court Record button! Remember to use it when you're in a pinch with [the R Button / Tab]. (Changed from [Remember to use it when you're in a pinch.] in the original release)
Judge:
Let me ask that one again:
Leads back to:
"Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?"Cinder Block







Phoenix:
Oh, um, wasn't it Ms. Block? Ms. Cinder Block?
Judge:
The person in question was a victim of murder, not ill-conceived naming, Mr. Wright.
Mia:
Wright? If you forget something, use [the R Button / Tab] to check the Court Record and jog your memory. (Changed from [If you forget something, [just touch the Court Record button to help you remember.] in the original release) A mistake in court could cost you the case.
Judge:
I'll ask you again:
Leads back to:
"Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?"Cindy Stone







Leads to:
"Um... the victim's name is Cindy Stone."Phoenix:
Um... the victim's name is Cindy Stone.Judge:
Correct. Now, tell me, what was the cause of death? She died because she was...?Poisoned







Phoenix:
Oh, right! Wasn't she, um, poisoned by er... poison?
Judge:
You're asking me!?
Phoenix:
Um... Chief! Help me out!
Mia:
Check the court record. [The R Button / Tab]... remember? (Changed from [Check the court record. The Court Record button... remember?] in the original release)
Phoenix:
(Geez. Give a guy a break!)
Judge:
Let me ask again.
Leads back to:
"She died because she was...?"Hit with a blunt object







Leads to:
"She was struck once, by a blunt object."Strangled







Phoenix:
Right... she was strangled, wasn't she?
Mia:
Please tell me that was you talking to yourself.
Judge:
If you wish to hang yourself, Mr. Wright, you're welcome to, but not inside my courtroom. I suppose there's nothing to do but give you another try:
Leads back to:
"She died because she was...?"Phoenix:
She was struck once, by a blunt object.Judge:
Correct. You've answered all my questions. I see no reason why we shouldn't proceed. You seem much more relaxed, Mr. Wright. Good for you.Phoenix:
Thank you, Your Honor. (Because I don't FEEL relaxed, that's for sure.)Judge:
Well, then... First, a question for the prosecution. Mr. Payne?Payne:
Yes, Your Honor?Judge:
As Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to the court just what that "object" was?Payne:
The murder weapon was this statue of "The Thinker." It was found lying on the floor, next to the victim.Judge:
I see... The court accepts it into evidence. (Changed from [I see... the court accepts it into evidence.] in the original release)Statue added to the Court Record.Mia:
Wright... Be sure to pay attention to any evidence added during the trial. That evidence is the only ammunition you have in court. [Touch the Court Record button / Use the R Button] to check the Court Record frequently.Judge:
Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its first witness.Payne:
The prosecution calls the defendant, Mr. Butz, to the stand.Phoenix:
Um, Chief, what do I do now?Mia:
Pay attention. You don't want to miss any information that might help your client's case. You'll get your chance to respond to the prosecution later, so be ready! Let's just hope he doesn't say anything... unfortunate.Phoenix:
(Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... This could be bad.) (Changed from [Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... this could be bad.] in the original release)Payne:
Ahem. Mr. Butz. Is it not true that the victim had recently dumped you?Butz:
Hey, watch it buddy! We were great together! We were Romeo and Juliet, Cleopatra and Mark Anthony!Phoenix:
(Um... didn't they all die?)Butz:
I wasn't dumped! She just wasn't taking my phone calls. Or seeing me... Ever. WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?Payne:
Mr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by "dumped." In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!Butz:
Whaddya mean, "one of them"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!Payne:
Your Honor, the victim's passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.Passport added to the Court Record.Judge:
Hmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.Butz:
Dude... no way...Payne:
The victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several "Sugar Daddies."Butz:
Daddies? Sugar?Payne:
Yes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.Butz:
Duuude!Payne:
We can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?Mia:
Wright... I don't think you want him to answer that question.Phoenix:
(Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)Wait and see what happens







Phoenix:
(Might be better not to get involved in this one...)
Payne:
Well, Mr. Butz?
Butz:
Dude, no way! That cheatin' she-dog!
Leads to:
"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!"Stop him from answering







Phoenix:
My client had no idea the victim was seeing other men! That question is irrelevant to this case!
Payne:
Oof! *wince*
Butz:
Dude! Nick! Whaddya mean, "irrelevant"!? That cheatin' she-dog!
Leads to:
"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!"Butz:
I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I'm going to get to the bottom of this!Judge:
Let's continue with the trial, shall we?Payne:
I believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.Judge:
Yes, quite.Phoenix:
(Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)Payne:
Next question! You went to the victim's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?Butz:
Gulp!Payne:
Well, did you, or did you not?Butz:
Heh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn't!Phoenix:
(Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)Have him answer honestly







Phoenix:
(I know! I'll send him a signal...)

(TELL THE TRUTH)

Butz:
Er... Yeah! Yeah! I was there! I went!
Judge:
Order! Well, Mr. Butz?
Butz:
Dude, chill! She wasn't home, man... So, like, I didn't see her.
Payne:

Payne:
Your Honor, the defendant is lying.
Judge:
Lying?
Payne:
The prosecution would like to call a witness who can prove Mr. Butz is lying.
Leads to:
"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"Stop him from answering







Phoenix:
(I'll send him a signal...)

(LIE LIKE A DOG)

Butz:
Um, well, see, it's like this: I don't remember.
Payne:
You "don't remember"? Well then, we'll just have to remind you!
Phoenix:
(I got a bad feeling about this...)
Payne:
We have a witness that can prove he DID go to the victim's apartment that day!
Leads to:
"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"Judge:
Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?Payne:
The man who found the victim's body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw the defendant fleeing the scene of the crime!Judge:
Order! Order in the court! Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.Payne:
Yes, Your Honor.Phoenix:
(This is bad...)Payne:
On the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim's building. Please bring Mr. Frank Sahwit to the stand!Payne:
Mr. Sahwit, you sell newspaper subscriptions, is this correct?Sahwit:
Oh, oh yes! Newspapers, yes!Judge:
Mr. Sahwit, you may proceed with your testimony. Please tell the court what you saw on the day of the murder.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Sahwit:
I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.
I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.
Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.
Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!
I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.
I thought to call the police immediately!
However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.
I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.
I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.
The man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Judge:
Hmm...Phoenix:
(Larry! Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!)Judge:
Incidentally, why wasn't the phone in the victim's apartment working?Payne:
Your Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.Judge:
Aren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?Payne:
Yes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.Blackout Record added to the Court Record.Judge:
Now, Mr. Wright...Phoenix:
Yes! Er... yes, Your Honor?Judge:
You may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:
C-Cross-examination, Your Honor?Mia:
Alright, Wright, this is it. The real deal!Phoenix:
Uh... what exactly am I supposed to do?Mia:
Why, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!Phoenix:
Lies! What?! He was lying!?Mia:
Your client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?Phoenix:
!!! How do I prove he's not?Mia:
You hold the key! It's in the evidence! Compare the witness's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there! First, find contradictions between the Court Record and the witness's testimony. Then, once you've found the contradicting evidence... present it and rub it in the witness's face!Phoenix:
Um... okay.Mia:
Open the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab], then point out contradictions in the testimony! (Changed from [Touch the Court Record button and point out contradictions in the testimony!] in the original release)Cross Examination-- Witness's Account --Sahwit:

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Isn't a man leaving an apartment a common sight? I find it odd you would take notice of him...
Sahwit:
Er... heh. I don't know. He just seemed strange to me, that's all. Like he was mad, and yet frightened at the same time. Just like... a criminal fleeing the scene of a crime!
Phoenix:
The defense requests that the witness refrain from conjecture!
Payne:
Of course. What the witness means is that the man he saw looked suspicious. So, what happened next?Sahwit:
I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Half-open... you say?
Sahwit:
Yes, yes, the door was open halfway. Yes. I watched for a moment, but no one came to close the door. "That's odd, in a big city like this," I thought...
Payne:
I see. And what happened next?Sahwit:
Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What gave you the idea to do that?
Sahwit:
Well, the door was half-open, you see. Isn't it only human to want to... peek? We climb mountains because they are there! It's the same thing.
Payne:
Truer words have never been spoken! Anyone would look inside!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... why did Payne cut him off so quickly?)
Payne:
So you looked into the apartment. What happened then?Sahwit:
Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Are you sure she was dead?
Sahwit:
W-Well, no, I guess I wasn't. But, she wasn't moving at all, and there was blood everywhere.
Phoenix:
(I guess that would look fatal to anyone...) Very well, what happened next?Sahwit:
I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So, you didn't touch ANYTHING in the apartment?
Sahwit:
Um, yes. I mean no! Nothing.
Phoenix:
Okay. What happened next?Sahwit:
I thought to call the police immediately!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
You "thought" to call the police? Does that mean you didn't actually call them!?
Payne:
Please, please... Listen to the rest of the testimony. You thought to call the police... What happened next?Sahwit:
However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
The phone in her apartment wasn't working?
Sahwit:
Yes. I mean, no. No, it wasn't. Right. (Changed from [Yes. I mean, no, no it wasn't. Right.] in the original release)
Phoenix:
But you said you didn't go into the apartment... or did you!?
Sahwit:
Oh, oh, that? I can explain that! There was a cordless phone on a shelf in the entranceway. I reached inside and tried using that to call...
Payne:
And the phone wasn't working, correct? What happened next?Sahwit:
I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Why use a public phone?
Sahwit:
Well, you see, I don't have a cell phone. And, being the middle of the afternoon, there was no answer at the nearby apartments.
Phoenix:
Ah, right... what time did you call again?Sahwit:
I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
1:00 PM! Are you certain?
Sahwit:
Yes. Absolutely.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... He seems really confident.)
Mia:
1:00 PM? Wright. Doesn't that seem strange to you? Present some evidence to contradict him!Present Cindy's Autopsy Report







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"You found the body at 1:00 PM. You're sure?"Sahwit:
The man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Are you absolutely, 100% positive?
Sahwit:
Yes, it was him. No mistake about it.
Payne:
The witness says he's certain!Mia:
That's all of it. There must be a contradiction in there somewhere. Examine the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab] if something strikes you as being suspicious. (Changed from [Examine the Court Record button if something strikes you as being suspicious.] in the original release) Then, find the evidence that contradicts his testimony, and present it to the court!Phoenix:
You found the body at 1:00 PM. You're sure?Sahwit:
Yes. It was 1:00 PM, for certain.Phoenix:
Frankly, I find that hard to believe! Your statement directly contradicts the autopsy report. The autopsy notes the time of death at sometime after 4PM. There was nobody to... er... no "body" to find at 1:00 PM! How do you explain this three-hour gap?Sahwit:
!!! Oh, that! Oh, er...Payne:Payne:
This is trivial! The witness merely forgot the time!Judge:
After his testimony, I find that hard to believe. Mr. Sahwit... Why were you so certain that you found the body at 1:00 PM?Sahwit:
I... er... well, I... Gee, that's a really good question!Mia:
Great job, Wright! Way to put him on the spot! That's all you have to do: point out contradictions! Lies always beget more lies! See through one, and their whole story falls apart!Sahwit:
Wait! I remember now!Judge:
Would you care to give your testimony again?Witness Testimony-- The Time of Discovery --Sahwit:
You see, when I found the body, I heard the time.
There was a voice saying the time... It was probably coming from the television.
Oh, but it was three hours off, wasn't it?
I guess the victim must have been watching a video of a taped program!
That's why I thought it was 1:00 PM!
Terribly sorry about the misunderstanding...Judge:
Hmm... I see. You heard a voice saying the time on a taped program. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Mia:

A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: "When something smells, it\'s usually the Butz." In the 23 years I\'ve known him, it\'s usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it\'s usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he\'s a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one.

Wasn\'t she, um, poisoned by er... poison?\nJudge:\nYou\'re asking me!?\nPhoenix:\nUm... Chief! Help me out!\nMia:\nCheck the court record. [The R Button / Tab]... remember? (Changed from [Check the court record. The Court Record button... remember?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Geez. Give a guy a break!)\nJudge:\nLet me ask again.\nLeads back to:\n"She died because she was...?"Hit with a blunt object\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n"She was struck once, by a blunt object."Strangled\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nRight... she was strangled, wasn\'t she?\nMia:\nPlease tell me that was you talking to yourself.\nJudge:\nIf you wish to hang yourself, Mr. Wright, you\'re welcome to, but not inside my courtroom. I suppose there\'s nothing to do but give you another try:\nLeads back to:\n"She died because she was...?"Phoenix:\nShe was struck once, by a blunt object.Judge:\nCorrect. You\'ve answered all my questions. I see no reason why we shouldn\'t proceed. You seem much more relaxed, Mr. Wright. Good for you.Phoenix:\nThank you, Your Honor. (Because I don\'t FEEL relaxed, that\'s for sure.)Judge:\nWell, then... First, a question for the prosecution. Mr. Payne?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nAs Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to the court just what that "object" was?Payne:\nThe murder weapon was this statue of "The Thinker." It was found lying on the floor, next to the victim.Judge:\nI see... The court accepts it into evidence. (Changed from [I see... the court accepts it into evidence.] in the original release)Statue added to the Court Record.Mia:\nWright... Be sure to pay attention to any evidence added during the trial. That evidence is the only ammunition you have in court. [Touch the Court Record button / Use the R Button] to check the Court Record frequently.Judge:\nMr. Payne, the prosecution may call its first witness.Payne:\nThe prosecution calls the defendant, Mr. Butz, to the stand.Phoenix:\nUm, Chief, what do I do now?Mia:\nPay attention. You don\'t want to miss any information that might help your client\'s case. You\'ll get your chance to respond to the prosecution later, so be ready! Let\'s just hope he doesn\'t say anything... unfortunate.Phoenix:\n(Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... This could be bad.) (Changed from [Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... this could be bad.] in the original release)Payne:\nAhem. Mr. Butz. Is it not true that the victim had recently dumped you?Butz:\nHey, watch it buddy! We were great together! We were Romeo and Juliet, Cleopatra and Mark Anthony!Phoenix:\n(Um... didn\'t they all die?)Butz:\nI wasn\'t dumped! She just wasn\'t taking my phone calls. Or seeing me... Ever. WHAT\'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?Payne:\nMr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by "dumped." In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!Butz:\nWhaddya mean, "one of them"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don\'t believe a word of it!Payne:\nYour Honor, the victim\'s passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.Passport added to the Court Record.Judge:\nHmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.Butz:\nDude... no way...Payne:\nThe victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several "Sugar Daddies."Butz:\nDaddies? Sugar?Payne:\nYes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.Butz:\nDuuude!Payne:\nWe can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?Mia:\nWright... I don\'t think you want him to answer that question.Phoenix:\n(Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)Wait and see what happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Might be better not to get involved in this one...)\nPayne:\nWell, Mr. Butz?\nButz:\nDude, no way! That cheatin\' she-dog!\nLeads to:\n"I\'m gonna die. I\'m just gonna drop dead!"Stop him from answering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMy client had no idea the victim was seeing other men! That question is irrelevant to this case!\nPayne:\nOof! *wince*\nButz:\nDude! Nick! Whaddya mean, "irrelevant"!? That cheatin\' she-dog!\nLeads to:\n"I\'m gonna die. I\'m just gonna drop dead!"Butz:\nI\'m gonna die. I\'m just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I\'m going to get to the bottom of this!Judge:\nLet\'s continue with the trial, shall we?Payne:\nI believe the accused\'s motive is clear to everyone.Judge:\nYes, quite.Phoenix:\n(Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)Payne:\nNext question! You went to the victim\'s apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?Butz:\nGulp!Payne:\nWell, did you, or did you not?Butz:\nHeh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn\'t!Phoenix:\n(Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)Have him answer honestly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I know! I\'ll send him a signal...)\n\n(TELL THE TRUTH)\n\nButz:\nEr... Yeah! Yeah! I was there! I went!\nJudge:\nOrder! Well, Mr. Butz?\nButz:\nDude, chill! She wasn\'t home, man... So, like, I didn\'t see her.\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nYour Honor, the defendant is lying.\nJudge:\nLying?\nPayne:\nThe prosecution would like to call a witness who can prove Mr. Butz is lying.\nLeads to:\n"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"Stop him from answering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I\'ll send him a signal...)\n\n(LIE LIKE A DOG)\n\nButz:\nUm, well, see, it\'s like this: I don\'t remember.\nPayne:\nYou "don\'t remember"? Well then, we\'ll just have to remind you!\nPhoenix:\n(I got a bad feeling about this...)\nPayne:\nWe have a witness that can prove he DID go to the victim\'s apartment that day!\nLeads to:\n"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"Judge:\nWell, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?Payne:\nThe man who found the victim\'s body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw the defendant fleeing the scene of the crime!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.Payne:\nYes, Your Honor.Phoenix:\n(This is bad...)Payne:\nOn the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim\'s building. Please bring Mr. Frank Sahwit to the stand!Payne:\nMr. Sahwit, you sell newspaper subscriptions, is this correct?Sahwit:\nOh, oh yes! Newspapers, yes!Judge:\nMr. Sahwit, you may proceed with your testimony. Please tell the court what you saw on the day of the murder.Witness Testimony-- Witness\'s Account --Sahwit:\nI was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.\nI thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.\nThinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.\nThen I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!\nI quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.\nI thought to call the police immediately!\nHowever, the phone in her apartment wasn\'t working.\nI went to a nearby park and found a public phone.\nI remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.\nThe man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Judge:\nHmm...Phoenix:\n(Larry! Why didn\'t you tell the truth? I can\'t defend you against a testimony like that!)Judge:\nIncidentally, why wasn\'t the phone in the victim\'s apartment working?Payne:\nYour Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.Judge:\nAren\'t phones supposed to work during a blackout?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.Blackout Record added to the Court Record.Judge:\nNow, Mr. Wright...Phoenix:\nYes! Er... yes, Your Honor?Judge:\nYou may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:\nC-Cross-examination, Your Honor?Mia:\nAlright, Wright, this is it. The real deal!Phoenix:\nUh... what exactly am I supposed to do?Mia:\nWhy, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!Phoenix:\nLies! What?! He was lying!?Mia:\nYour client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?Phoenix:\n!!! How do I prove he\'s not?Mia:\nYou hold the key! It\'s in the evidence! Compare the witness\'s testimony to the evidence at hand. There\'s bound to be a contradiction in there! First, find contradictions between the Court Record and the witness\'s testimony. Then, once you\'ve found the contradicting evidence... present it and rub it in the witness\'s face!Phoenix:\nUm... okay.Mia:\nOpen the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab], then point out contradictions in the testimony! (Changed from [Touch the Court Record button and point out contradictions in the testimony!] in the original release)Cross Examination-- Witness\'s Account --Sahwit:\nI was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nIsn\'t a man leaving an apartment a common sight? I find it odd you would take notice of him...\nSahwit:\nEr... heh. I don\'t know. He just seemed strange to me, that\'s all. Like he was mad, and yet frightened at the same time. Just like... a criminal fleeing the scene of a crime!\nPhoenix:\nThe defense requests that the witness refrain from conjecture!\nPayne:\nOf course. What the witness means is that the man he saw looked suspicious. So, what happened next?Sahwit:\nI thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHalf-open... you say?\nSahwit:\nYes, yes, the door was open halfway. Yes. I watched for a moment, but no one came to close the door. "That\'s odd, in a big city like this," I thought...\nPayne:\nI see. And what happened next?Sahwit:\nThinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat gave you the idea to do that?\nSahwit:\nWell, the door was half-open, you see. Isn\'t it only human to want to... peek? We climb mountains because they are there! It\'s the same thing.\nPayne:\nTruer words have never been spoken! Anyone would look inside!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... why did Payne cut him off so quickly?)\nPayne:\nSo you looked into the apartment. What happened then?Sahwit:\nThen I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure she was dead?\nSahwit:\nW-Well, no, I guess I wasn\'t. But, she wasn\'t moving at all, and there was blood everywhere.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess that would look fatal to anyone...) Very well, what happened next?Sahwit:\nI quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, you didn\'t touch ANYTHING in the apartment?\nSahwit:\nUm, yes. I mean no! Nothing.\nPhoenix:\nOkay. What happened next?Sahwit:\nI thought to call the police immediately!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou "thought" to call the police? Does that mean you didn\'t actually call them!?\nPayne:\nPlease, please... Listen to the rest of the testimony. You thought to call the police... What happened next?Sahwit:\nHowever, the phone in her apartment wasn\'t working.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe phone in her apartment wasn\'t working?\nSahwit:\nYes. I mean, no. No, it wasn\'t. Right. (Changed from [Yes. I mean, no, no it wasn\'t. Right.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nBut you said you didn\'t go into the apartment... or did you!?\nSahwit:\nOh, oh, that? I can explain that! There was a cordless phone on a shelf in the entranceway. I reached inside and tried using that to call...\nPayne:\nAnd the phone wasn\'t working, correct? What happened next?Sahwit:\nI went to a nearby park and found a public phone.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy use a public phone?\nSahwit:\nWell, you see, I don\'t have a cell phone. And, being the middle of the afternoon, there was no answer at the nearby apartments.\nPhoenix:\nAh, right... what time did you call again?Sahwit:\nI remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n1:00 PM! Are you certain?\nSahwit:\nYes. Absolutely.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... He seems really confident.)\nMia:\n1:00 PM? Wright. Doesn\'t that seem strange to you? Present some evidence to contradict him!Present Cindy\'s Autopsy Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n"You found the body at 1:00 PM. You\'re sure?"Sahwit:\nThe man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely, 100% positive?\nSahwit:\nYes, it was him. No mistake about it.\nPayne:\nThe witness says he\'s certain!Mia:\nThat\'s all of it. There must be a contradiction in there somewhere. Examine the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab] if something strikes you as being suspicious. (Changed from [Examine the Court Record button if something strikes you as being suspicious.] in the original release) Then, find the evidence that contradicts his testimony, and present it to the court!Phoenix:\nYou found the body at 1:00 PM. You\'re sure?Sahwit:\nYes. It was 1:00 PM, for certain.Phoenix:\nFrankly, I find that hard to believe! Your statement directly contradicts the autopsy report. The autopsy notes the time of death at sometime after 4PM. There was nobody to... er... no "body" to find at 1:00 PM! How do you explain this three-hour gap?Sahwit:\n!!! Oh, that! Oh, er...Payne:Payne:\nThis is trivial! The witness merely forgot the time!Judge:\nAfter his testimony, I find that hard to believe. Mr. Sahwit... Why were you so certain that you found the body at 1:00 PM?Sahwit:\nI... er... well, I... Gee, that\'s a really good question!Mia:\nGreat job, Wright! Way to put him on the spot! That\'s all you have to do: point out contradictions! Lies always beget more lies! See through one, and their whole story falls apart!Sahwit:\nWait! I remember now!Judge:\nWould you care to give your testimony again?Witness Testimony-- The Time of Discovery --Sahwit:\nYou see, when I found the body, I heard the time.\nThere was a voice saying the time... It was probably coming from the television.\nOh, but it was three hours off, wasn\'t it?\nI guess the victim must have been watching a video of a taped program!\nThat\'s why I thought it was 1:00 PM!\nTerribly sorry about the misunderstanding...Judge:\nHmm... I see. You heard a voice saying the time on a taped program. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Mia:\nWright! You know what to do!Phoenix:\nI\'ve got this one.Cross Examination'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o'}}

Dammit! ...Why me? I can't get caught... Not like this! I-I've gotta find someone to pin this on... Someone like... him! I'll make it look like HE did it!August 3, 9:47 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2Phoenix:
(Boy am I nervous!)Mia:
Wright!Phoenix:
Oh, h-hiya, Chief.Mia:
Whew, I'm glad I made it on time. Well, I have to say Phoenix, I'm impressed! Not everyone takes on a murder trial right off the bat like this. It says a lot about you... and your client as well.Phoenix:
Um... thanks. Actually, it's because I owe him a favor.Mia:
A favor? You mean, you knew the defendant before this case?Phoenix:
Yes. Actually, I kind of owe my current job to him. He's one of the reasons I became an attorney.Mia:
Well, that's news to me!Phoenix:
I want to help him out any way I can! I just... really want to help him. I owe him that much.???:
(It's over! My life, everything, it's all over!)Mia:
... Is that your client screaming over there? (Changed from [Isn't that your client screaming over there?] in the original release)Phoenix:
Yeah... it's him. (Changed from [Yeah... that's him.] in the original release)???:
(Death! Despair! Ohhhh! I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna die!!!)Mia:
It sounds like he wants to die...Phoenix:
Um, yeah. *sigh*Butz:
Nick!!!Phoenix:
Hey. Hey there, Larry.Butz:
Dude, I'm so guilty!! Tell them I'm guilty!!! Gimme the death sentence! I ain't afraid to die!Phoenix:
What!? What's wrong, Larry?Butz:
Oh, it's all over... I... I'm finished. Finished! I can't live in a world without her! I can't! Who... who took her away from me, Nick? Who did this!? Aww, Nick, ya gotta tell me! Who took my baby away!?Phoenix:
(Hmm... The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say it was you...)Phoenix:
My name is Phoenix Wright. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: "When something smells, it's usually the Butz." In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!August 3, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz. (Changed from [The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.] in the original release)Payne:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The, um, defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:
Ahem. Mr. Wright? This is your first trial, is it not?Phoenix:
Y-Yes, Your Honor. I'm, um, a little nervous.Judge:
Your conduct during this trial will decide the fate of your client. Murder is a serious charge. For your client's sake, I hope you can control your nerves.Phoenix:
Thank... thank you, Your Honor.Judge:
... Mr. Wright, given the circumstances... I think we should have a test to ascertain your readiness.Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. (Gulp... Hands shaking... Eyesight... fading...)Judge:
This test will consist of a few simple questions. Answer them clearly and concisely. Please state the name of the defendant in this case.Phoenix Wright







Phoenix:
Um... the defendant... is me... right? (Changed from [Um... the defendant... is me, right?] in the original release)
Mia:
Wright! Have you completely lost your mind? Focus! The defendant is the person on trial! You're his lawyer!

Um, er, eh? Oh yeah, right! Eh heh heh.
Mia:
This is no laughing matter! You did pass the bar, didn't you?
Judge:
Sorry, I couldn't hear your answer. I'll ask once more:
Leads back to:
"Please state the name of the defendant in this case."Larry Butz







Leads to:
"The defendant? Well, that's Larry Butz, Your Honor."Mia Fey







Phoenix:
The, um, defendant? That's... er... Mia Fey?
Mia:
Wrong, Wright. Look, I have to leave. I have to go home. I'm... I'm expecting a delivery.
Phoenix:
Aw, c'mon Chief. There's no need to be going so soon, is there?
Mia:
Listen, Wright! (Changed from [Wright!] in the original release) The defendant is the one on trial--your client! (Changed from [Listen: the defendant is the one on trial--your client!] in the original release) I mean, that's about as basic as you can get!
Phoenix:
(I've put my foot in it this time! I've got to relax!)
Judge:
Sorry, I couldn't hear your answer. I'll ask once more:
Leads back to:
"Please state the name of the defendant in this case."Phoenix:
The defendant? Well, that's Larry Butz, Your Honor.Judge:
Correct. Just keep your wits about you and you'll do fine. Next question: This is a murder trial. Tell me, what's the victim's name?Phoenix:
(Whew, I know this one! Glad I read the case report cover to cover so many times. It's... wait... Uh-oh! No... no way! I forgot! I'm drawing a total blank here!)Mia:
Phoenix! Are you absolutely SURE you're up to this? You don't even know the victim's name!?Phoenix:
Oh, the victim! O-Of course I know the victim's name! I, um, just forgot. ...Temporarily (Changed from [I, um, just forgot. ... Temporarily.] in the original release)Mia:
I think I feel a migraine coming on. Look, the victim's name is listed in the Court Record. Just press [the R Button / Tab] to check it at any time, okay? (Changed from [Just touch the Court Record button to check it at any time, okay?] in the original release) Remember to check it often. Do it for me, please. I'm begging you.Judge:
Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?Mia Fey







Phoenix:
Um... Mia Fey?
Mia:
W-W-What!? How can I be the victim!?
Phoenix:
Oh! Right! Sorry! I, er, it was the first name that popped into my head, and--
Mia:
The Court Record button! Remember to use it when you're in a pinch with [the R Button / Tab]. (Changed from [Remember to use it when you're in a pinch.] in the original release)
Judge:
Let me ask that one again:
Leads back to:
"Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?"Cinder Block







Phoenix:
Oh, um, wasn't it Ms. Block? Ms. Cinder Block?
Judge:
The person in question was a victim of murder, not ill-conceived naming, Mr. Wright.
Mia:
Wright? If you forget something, use [the R Button / Tab] to check the Court Record and jog your memory. (Changed from [If you forget something, [just touch the Court Record button to help you remember.] in the original release) A mistake in court could cost you the case.
Judge:
I'll ask you again:
Leads back to:
"Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?"Cindy Stone







Leads to:
"Um... the victim's name is Cindy Stone."Phoenix:
Um... the victim's name is Cindy Stone.Judge:
Correct. Now, tell me, what was the cause of death? She died because she was...?Poisoned







Phoenix:
Oh, right! Wasn't she, um, poisoned by er... poison?
Judge:
You're asking me!?
Phoenix:
Um... Chief! Help me out!
Mia:
Check the court record. [The R Button / Tab]... remember? (Changed from [Check the court record. The Court Record button... remember?] in the original release)
Phoenix:
(Geez. Give a guy a break!)
Judge:
Let me ask again.
Leads back to:
"She died because she was...?"Hit with a blunt object







Leads to:
"She was struck once, by a blunt object."Strangled







Phoenix:
Right... she was strangled, wasn't she?
Mia:
Please tell me that was you talking to yourself.
Judge:
If you wish to hang yourself, Mr. Wright, you're welcome to, but not inside my courtroom. I suppose there's nothing to do but give you another try:
Leads back to:
"She died because she was...?"Phoenix:
She was struck once, by a blunt object.Judge:
Correct. You've answered all my questions. I see no reason why we shouldn't proceed. You seem much more relaxed, Mr. Wright. Good for you.Phoenix:
Thank you, Your Honor. (Because I don't FEEL relaxed, that's for sure.)Judge:
Well, then... First, a question for the prosecution. Mr. Payne?Payne:
Yes, Your Honor?Judge:
As Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to the court just what that "object" was?Payne:
The murder weapon was this statue of "The Thinker." It was found lying on the floor, next to the victim.Judge:
I see... The court accepts it into evidence. (Changed from [I see... the court accepts it into evidence.] in the original release)Statue added to the Court Record.Mia:
Wright... Be sure to pay attention to any evidence added during the trial. That evidence is the only ammunition you have in court. [Touch the Court Record button / Use the R Button] to check the Court Record frequently.Judge:
Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its first witness.Payne:
The prosecution calls the defendant, Mr. Butz, to the stand.Phoenix:
Um, Chief, what do I do now?Mia:
Pay attention. You don't want to miss any information that might help your client's case. You'll get your chance to respond to the prosecution later, so be ready! Let's just hope he doesn't say anything... unfortunate.Phoenix:
(Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... This could be bad.) (Changed from [Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... this could be bad.] in the original release)Payne:
Ahem. Mr. Butz. Is it not true that the victim had recently dumped you?Butz:
Hey, watch it buddy! We were great together! We were Romeo and Juliet, Cleopatra and Mark Anthony!Phoenix:
(Um... didn't they all die?)Butz:
I wasn't dumped! She just wasn't taking my phone calls. Or seeing me... Ever. WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?Payne:
Mr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by "dumped." In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!Butz:
Whaddya mean, "one of them"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!Payne:
Your Honor, the victim's passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.Passport added to the Court Record.Judge:
Hmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.Butz:
Dude... no way...Payne:
The victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several "Sugar Daddies."Butz:
Daddies? Sugar?Payne:
Yes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.Butz:
Duuude!Payne:
We can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?Mia:
Wright... I don't think you want him to answer that question.Phoenix:
(Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)Wait and see what happens







Phoenix:
(Might be better not to get involved in this one...)
Payne:
Well, Mr. Butz?
Butz:
Dude, no way! That cheatin' she-dog!
Leads to:
"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!"Stop him from answering







Phoenix:
My client had no idea the victim was seeing other men! That question is irrelevant to this case!
Payne:
Oof! *wince*
Butz:
Dude! Nick! Whaddya mean, "irrelevant"!? That cheatin' she-dog!
Leads to:
"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!"Butz:
I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I'm going to get to the bottom of this!Judge:
Let's continue with the trial, shall we?Payne:
I believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.Judge:
Yes, quite.Phoenix:
(Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)Payne:
Next question! You went to the victim's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?Butz:
Gulp!Payne:
Well, did you, or did you not?Butz:
Heh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn't!Phoenix:
(Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)Have him answer honestly







Phoenix:
(I know! I'll send him a signal...)

(TELL THE TRUTH)

Butz:
Er... Yeah! Yeah! I was there! I went!
Judge:
Order! Well, Mr. Butz?
Butz:
Dude, chill! She wasn't home, man... So, like, I didn't see her.
Payne:

Payne:
Your Honor, the defendant is lying.
Judge:
Lying?
Payne:
The prosecution would like to call a witness who can prove Mr. Butz is lying.
Leads to:
"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"Stop him from answering







Phoenix:
(I'll send him a signal...)

(LIE LIKE A DOG)

Butz:
Um, well, see, it's like this: I don't remember.
Payne:
You "don't remember"? Well then, we'll just have to remind you!
Phoenix:
(I got a bad feeling about this...)
Payne:
We have a witness that can prove he DID go to the victim's apartment that day!
Leads to:
"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"Judge:
Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?Payne:
The man who found the victim's body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw the defendant fleeing the scene of the crime!Judge:
Order! Order in the court! Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.Payne:
Yes, Your Honor.Phoenix:
(This is bad...)Payne:
On the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim's building. Please bring Mr. Frank Sahwit to the stand!Payne:
Mr. Sahwit, you sell newspaper subscriptions, is this correct?Sahwit:
Oh, oh yes! Newspapers, yes!Judge:
Mr. Sahwit, you may proceed with your testimony. Please tell the court what you saw on the day of the murder.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Sahwit:
I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.
I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.
Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.
Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!
I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.
I thought to call the police immediately!
However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.
I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.
I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.
The man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Judge:
Hmm...Phoenix:
(Larry! Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!)Judge:
Incidentally, why wasn't the phone in the victim's apartment working?Payne:
Your Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.Judge:
Aren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?Payne:
Yes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.Blackout Record added to the Court Record.Judge:
Now, Mr. Wright...Phoenix:
Yes! Er... yes, Your Honor?Judge:
You may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:
C-Cross-examination, Your Honor?Mia:
Alright, Wright, this is it. The real deal!Phoenix:
Uh... what exactly am I supposed to do?Mia:
Why, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!Phoenix:
Lies! What?! He was lying!?Mia:
Your client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?Phoenix:
!!! How do I prove he's not?Mia:
You hold the key! It's in the evidence! Compare the witness's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there! First, find contradictions between the Court Record and the witness's testimony. Then, once you've found the contradicting evidence... present it and rub it in the witness's face!Phoenix:
Um... okay.Mia:
Open the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab], then point out contradictions in the testimony! (Changed from [Touch the Court Record button and point out contradictions in the testimony!] in the original release)Cross Examination-- Witness's Account --Sahwit:

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Isn't a man leaving an apartment a common sight? I find it odd you would take notice of him...
Sahwit:
Er... heh. I don't know. He just seemed strange to me, that's all. Like he was mad, and yet frightened at the same time. Just like... a criminal fleeing the scene of a crime!
Phoenix:
The defense requests that the witness refrain from conjecture!
Payne:
Of course. What the witness means is that the man he saw looked suspicious. So, what happened next?Sahwit:
I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Half-open... you say?
Sahwit:
Yes, yes, the door was open halfway. Yes. I watched for a moment, but no one came to close the door. "That's odd, in a big city like this," I thought...
Payne:
I see. And what happened next?Sahwit:
Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What gave you the idea to do that?
Sahwit:
Well, the door was half-open, you see. Isn't it only human to want to... peek? We climb mountains because they are there! It's the same thing.
Payne:
Truer words have never been spoken! Anyone would look inside!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... why did Payne cut him off so quickly?)
Payne:
So you looked into the apartment. What happened then?Sahwit:
Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Are you sure she was dead?
Sahwit:
W-Well, no, I guess I wasn't. But, she wasn't moving at all, and there was blood everywhere.
Phoenix:
(I guess that would look fatal to anyone...) Very well, what happened next?Sahwit:
I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So, you didn't touch ANYTHING in the apartment?
Sahwit:
Um, yes. I mean no! Nothing.
Phoenix:
Okay. What happened next?Sahwit:
I thought to call the police immediately!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
You "thought" to call the police? Does that mean you didn't actually call them!?

Please, please... Listen to the rest of the testimony. You thought to call the police... What happened next?Sahwit:
However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
The phone in her apartment wasn't working?
Sahwit:
Yes. I mean, no. No, it wasn't. Right. (Changed from [Yes. I mean, no, no it wasn't. Right.] in the original release)
Phoenix:
But you said you didn't go into the apartment... or did you!?
Sahwit:
Oh, oh, that? I can explain that! There was a cordless phone on a shelf in the entranceway. I reached inside and tried using that to call...
Payne:
And the phone wasn't working, correct? What happened next?Sahwit:
I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Why use a public phone?
Sahwit:
Well, you see, I don't have a cell phone. And, being the middle of the afternoon, there was no answer at the nearby apartments.
Phoenix:
Ah, right... what time did you call again?Sahwit:
I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
1:00 PM! Are you certain?
Sahwit:
Yes. Absolutely.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... He seems really confident.)
Mia:
1:00 PM? Wright. Doesn't that seem strange to you? Present some evidence to contradict him!Present Cindy's Autopsy Report







Phoenix:

"You found the body at 1:00 PM. You're sure?"Sahwit:
The man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Are you absolutely, 100% positive?
Sahwit:
Yes, it was him. No mistake about it.
Payne:
The witness says he's certain!Mia:
That's all of it. There must be a contradiction in there somewhere. Examine the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab] if something strikes you as being suspicious. (Changed from [Examine the Court Record button if something strikes you as being suspicious.] in the original release) Then, find the evidence that contradicts his testimony, and present it to the court!Phoenix:
You found the body at 1:00 PM. You're sure?Sahwit:
Yes. It was 1:00 PM, for certain.Phoenix:
Frankly, I find that hard to believe! Your statement directly contradicts the autopsy report. The autopsy notes the time of death at sometime after 4PM. There was nobody to... er... no "body" to find at 1:00 PM! How do you explain this three-hour gap?Sahwit:
!!! Oh, that! Oh, er...Payne:Payne:
This is trivial! The witness merely forgot the time!Judge:
After his testimony, I find that hard to believe. Mr. Sahwit... Why were you so certain that you found the body at 1:00 PM?Sahwit:
I... er... well, I... Gee, that's a really good question!Mia:
Great job, Wright! Way to put him on the spot! That's all you have to do: point out contradictions! Lies always beget more lies! See through one, and their whole story falls apart!Sahwit:
Wait! I remember now!Judge:
Would you care to give your testimony again?Witness Testimony-- The Time of Discovery --Sahwit:
You see, when I found the body, I heard the time.
There was a voice saying the time... It was probably coming from the television.
Oh, but it was three hours off, wasn't it?
I guess the victim must have been watching a video of a taped program!
That's why I thought it was 1:00 PM!
Terribly sorry about the misunderstanding...Judge:
Hmm... I see. You heard a voice saying the time on a taped program. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Mia:
Wright! You know what to do!Phoenix:

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
You said "heard"... Not "saw"?
Sahwit:
Yes, heard. All I saw was the body lying there... I didn't think to look at anything else, least of all my watch.
Phoenix:
Hmm... Isn't that a little strange? So you're saying you "heard" something. But if you were so shocked by the body, you wouldn't hear anything at all!
Payne:

Payne:
The witness did say he actually heard the time. It's ludicrous to suggest he "wouldn't hear anything"!
Judge:
Hmm... I have to agree with the prosecution. Witness, continue your testimony.Present Blackout Record

Incidentally, there was no radio on the premises. There was only one large television.

The defense has a point. Do you have an explanation for this, Mr. Sahwit?Sahwit:
No, I... I find it quite puzzling myself! Quite! ... Aah! W-wait! I remember now!Judge:
Mr. Sahwit? The court would prefer to hear an accurate testimony from the very beginning. These constant corrections are harming your credibility. That, and you seem rather... distraught.Sahwit:

The person responsible for your girlfriend\'s death? The newspapers say it was you...)Phoenix:\nMy name is Phoenix Wright. Here\'s the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: "When something smells, it\'s usually the Butz." In the 23 years I\'ve known him, it\'s usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it\'s usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he\'s a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that\'s just what I\'m going to do!August 3, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz. (Changed from [The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.] in the original release)Payne:\nThe prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:\nThe, um, defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:\nAhem. Mr. Wright? This is your first trial, is it not?Phoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor. I\'m, um, a little nervous.Judge:\nYour conduct during this trial will decide the fate of your client. Murder is a serious charge. For your client\'s sake, I hope you can control your nerves.Phoenix:\nThank... thank you, Your Honor.Judge:\n... Mr. Wright, given the circumstances... I think we should have a test to ascertain your readiness.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. (Gulp... Hands shaking... Eyesight... fading...)Judge:\nThis test will consist of a few simple questions. Answer them clearly and concisely. Please state the name of the defendant in this case.Phoenix Wright\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... the defendant... is me... right? (Changed from [Um... the defendant... is me, right?] in the original release)\nMia:\nWright! Have you completely lost your mind? Focus! The defendant is the person on trial! You\'re his lawyer!\nPhoenix:\nUm, er, eh? Oh yeah, right! Eh heh heh.\nMia:\nThis is no laughing matter! You did pass the bar, didn\'t you?\nJudge:\nSorry, I couldn\'t hear your answer. I\'ll ask once more:\nLeads back to:\n"Please state the name of the defendant in this case."Larry Butz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n"The defendant? Well, that\'s Larry Butz, Your Honor."Mia Fey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe, um, defendant? That\'s... er... Mia Fey?\nMia:\nWrong, Wright. Look, I have to leave. I have to go home. I\'m... I\'m expecting a delivery.\nPhoenix:\nAw, c\'mon Chief. There\'s no need to be going so soon, is there?\nMia:\nListen, Wright! (Changed from [Wright!] in the original release) The defendant is the one on trial--your client! (Changed from [Listen: the defendant is the one on trial--your client!] in the original release) I mean, that\'s about as basic as you can get!\nPhoenix:\n(I\'ve put my foot in it this time! I\'ve got to relax!)\nJudge:\nSorry, I couldn\'t hear your answer. I\'ll ask once more:\nLeads back to:\n"Please state the name of the defendant in this case."Phoenix:\nThe defendant? Well, that\'s Larry Butz, Your Honor.Judge:\nCorrect. Just keep your wits about you and you\'ll do fine. Next question: This is a murder trial. Tell me, what\'s the victim\'s name?Phoenix:\n(Whew, I know this one! Glad I read the case report cover to cover so many times. It\'s... wait... Uh-oh! No... no way! I forgot! I\'m drawing a total blank here!)Mia:\nPhoenix! Are you absolutely SURE you\'re up to this? You don\'t even know the victim\'s name!?Phoenix:\nOh, the victim! O-Of course I know the victim\'s name! I, um, just forgot. ...Temporarily (Changed from [I, um, just forgot. ... Temporarily.] in the original release)Mia:\nI think I feel a migraine coming on. Look, the victim\'s name is listed in the Court Record. Just press [the R Button / Tab] to check it at any time, okay? (Changed from [Just touch the Court Record button to check it at any time, okay?] in the original release) Remember to check it often. Do it for me, please. I\'m begging you.Judge:\nMr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?Mia Fey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... Mia Fey?\nMia:\nW-W-What!? How can I be the victim!?\nPhoenix:\nOh! Right! Sorry! I, er, it was the first name that popped into my head, and--\nMia:\nThe Court Record button! Remember to use it when you\'re in a pinch with [the R Button / Tab]. (Changed from [Remember to use it when you\'re in a pinch.] in the original release)\nJudge:\nLet me ask that one again:\nLeads back to:\n"Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?"Cinder Block\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOh, um, wasn\'t it Ms. Block? Ms. Cinder Block?\nJudge:\nThe person in question was a victim of murder, not ill-conceived naming, Mr. Wright.\nMia:\nWright? If you forget something, use [the R Button / Tab] to check the Court Record and jog your memory. (Changed from [If you forget something, [just touch the Court Record button to help you remember.] in the original release) A mistake in court could cost you the case.\nJudge:\nI\'ll ask you again:\nLeads back to:\n"Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?"Cindy Stone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n"Um... the victim\'s name is Cindy Stone."Phoenix:\nUm... the victim\'s name is Cindy Stone.Judge:\nCorrect. Now, tell me, what was the cause of death? She died because she was...?Poisoned\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOh, right! Wasn\'t she, um, poisoned by er... poison?\nJudge:\nYou\'re asking me!?\nPhoenix:\nUm... Chief! Help me out!\nMia:\nCheck the court record. [The R Button / Tab]... remember? (Changed from [Check the court record. The Court Record button... remember?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Geez. Give a guy a break!)\nJudge:\nLet me ask again.\nLeads back to:\n"She died because she was...?"Hit with a blunt object\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n"She was struck once, by a blunt object."Strangled\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nRight... she was strangled, wasn\'t she?\nMia:\nPlease tell me that was you talking to yourself.\nJudge:\nIf you wish to hang yourself, Mr. Wright, you\'re welcome to, but not inside my courtroom. I suppose there\'s nothing to do but give you another try:\nLeads back to:\n"She died because she was...?"Phoenix:\nShe was struck once, by a blunt object.Judge:\nCorrect. You\'ve answered all my questions. I see no reason why we shouldn\'t proceed. You seem much more relaxed, Mr. Wright. Good for you.Phoenix:\nThank you, Your Honor. (Because I don\'t FEEL relaxed, that\'s for sure.)Judge:\nWell, then... First, a question for the prosecution. Mr. Payne?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nAs Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to the court just what that "object" was?Payne:\nThe murder weapon was this statue of "The Thinker." It was found lying on the floor, next to the victim.Judge:\nI see... The court accepts it into evidence. (Changed from [I see... the court accepts it into evidence.] in the original release)Statue added to the Court Record.Mia:\nWright... Be sure to pay attention to any evidence added during the trial. That evidence is the only ammunition you have in court. [Touch the Court Record button / Use the R Button] to check the Court Record frequently.Judge:\nMr. Payne, the prosecution may call its first witness.Payne:\nThe prosecution calls the defendant, Mr. Butz, to the stand.Phoenix:\nUm, Chief, what do I do now?Mia:\nPay attention. You don\'t want to miss any information that might help your client\'s case. You\'ll get your chance to respond to the prosecution later, so be ready! Let\'s just hope he doesn\'t say anything... unfortunate.Phoenix:\n(Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... This could be bad.) (Changed from [Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... this could be bad.] in the original release)Payne:\nAhem. Mr. Butz. Is it not true that the victim had recently dumped you?Butz:\nHey, watch it buddy! We were great together! We were Romeo and Juliet, Cleopatra and Mark Anthony!Phoenix:\n(Um... didn\'t they all die?)Butz:\nI wasn\'t dumped! She just wasn\'t taking my phone calls. Or seeing me... Ever. WHAT\'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?Payne:\nMr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by "dumped." In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!Butz:\nWhaddya mean, "one of them"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don\'t believe a word of it!Payne:\nYour Honor, the victim\'s passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.Passport added to the Court Record.Judge:\nHmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.Butz:\nDude... no way...Payne:\nThe victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several "Sugar Daddies."Butz:\nDaddies? Sugar?Payne:\nYes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.Butz:\nDuuude!Payne:\nWe can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?Mia:\nWright... I don\'t think you want him to answer that question.Phoenix:\n(Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)Wait and see what happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Might be better not to get involved in this one...)\nPayne:\nWell, Mr. Butz?\nButz:\nDude, no way! That cheatin\' she-dog!\nLeads to:\n"I\'m gonna die. I\'m just gonna drop dead!"Stop him from answering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMy client had no idea the victim was seeing other men! That question is irrelevant to this case!\nPayne:\nOof! *wince*\nButz:\nDude! Nick! Whaddya mean, "irrelevant"!? That cheatin\' she-dog!\nLeads to:\n"I\'m gonna die. I\'m just gonna drop dead!"Butz:\nI\'m gonna die. I\'m just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I\'m going to get to the bottom of this!Judge:\nLet\'s continue with the trial, shall we?Payne:\nI believe the accused\'s motive is clear to everyone.Judge:\nYes, quite.Phoenix:\n(Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)Payne:\nNext question! You went to the victim\'s apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?Butz:\nGulp!Payne:\nWell, did you, or did you not?Butz:\nHeh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn\'t!Phoenix:\n(Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)Have him answer honestly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I know! I\'ll send him a signal...)\n\n(TELL THE TRUTH)\n\nButz:\nEr... Yeah! Yeah! I was there! I went!\nJudge:\nOrder! Well, Mr. Butz?\nButz:\nDude, chill! She wasn\'t home, man... So, like, I didn\'t see her.\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nYour Honor, the defendant is lying.\nJudge:\nLying?\nPayne:\nThe prosecution would like to call a witness who can prove Mr. Butz is lying.\nLeads to:\n"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"Stop him from answering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I\'ll send him a signal...)\n\n(LIE LIKE A DOG)\n\nButz:\nUm, well, see, it\'s like this: I don\'t remember.\nPayne:\nYou "don\'t remember"? Well then, we\'ll just have to remind you!\nPhoenix:\n(I got a bad feeling about this...)\nPayne:\nWe have a witness that can prove he DID go to the victim\'s apartment that day!\nLeads to:\n"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"Judge:\nWell, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?Payne:\nThe man who found the victim\'s body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw the defendant fleeing the scene of the crime!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.Payne:\nYes, Your Honor.Phoenix:\n(This is bad...)Payne:\nOn the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim\'s building. Please bring Mr. Frank Sahwit to the stand!Payne:\nMr. Sahwit, you sell newspaper subscriptions, is this correct?Sahwit:\nOh, oh yes! Newspapers, yes!Judge:\nMr. Sahwit, you may proceed with your testimony. Please tell the court what you saw on the day of the murder.Witness Testimony-- Witness\'s Account --Sahwit:\nI was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.\nI thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.\nThinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.\nThen I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!\nI quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.\nI thought to call the police immediately!\nHowever, the phone in her apartment wasn\'t working.\nI went to a nearby park and found a public phone.\nI remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.\nThe man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Judge:\nHmm...Phoenix:\n(Larry! Why didn\'t you tell the truth? I can\'t defend you against a testimony like that!)Judge:\nIncidentally, why wasn\'t the phone in the victim\'s apartment working?Payne:\nYour Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.Judge:\nAren\'t phones supposed to work during a blackout?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.Blackout Record added to the Court Record.Judge:\nNow, Mr. Wright...Phoenix:\nYes! Er... yes, Your Honor?Judge:\nYou may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:\nC-Cross-examination, Your Honor?Mia:\nAlright, Wright, this is it. The real deal!Phoenix:\nUh... what exactly am I supposed to do?Mia:\nWhy, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!Phoenix:\nLies! What?! He was lying!?Mia:\nYour client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?Phoenix:\n!!! How do I prove he\'s not?Mia:\nYou hold the key! It\'s in the evidence! Compare the witness\'s testimony to the evidence at hand. There\'s bound to be a contradiction in there! First, find contradictions between the Court Record and the witness\'s testimony. Then, once you\'ve found the contradicting evidence... present it and rub it in the witness\'s face!Phoenix:\nUm... okay.Mia:\nOpen the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab], then point out contradictions in the testimony! (Changed from [Touch the Court Record button and point out contradictions in the testimony!] in the original release)Cross Examination-- Witness\'s Account --Sahwit:\nI was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nIsn\'t a man leaving an apartment a common sight? I find it odd you would take notice of him...\nSahwit:\nEr... heh. I don\'t know. He just seemed strange to me, that\'s all. Like he was mad, and yet frightened at the same time. Just like... a criminal fleeing the scene of a crime!\nPhoenix:\nThe defense requests that the witness refrain from conjecture!\nPayne:\nOf course. What the witness means is that the man he saw looked suspicious. So, what happened next?Sahwit:\nI thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHalf-open... you say?\nSahwit:\nYes, yes, the door was open halfway. Yes. I watched for a moment, but no one came to close the door. "That\'s odd, in a big city like this," I thought...\nPayne:\nI see. And what happened next?Sahwit:\nThinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat gave you the idea to do that?\nSahwit:\nWell, the door was half-open, you see. Isn\'t it only human to want to... peek? We climb mountains because they are there! It\'s the same thing.\nPayne:\nTruer words have never been spoken! Anyone would look inside!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... why did Payne cut him off so quickly?)\nPayne:\nSo you looked into the apartment. What happened then?Sahwit:\nThen I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure she was dead?\nSahwit:\nW-Well, no, I guess I wasn\'t. But, she wasn\'t moving at all, and there was blood everywhere.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess that would look fatal to anyone...) Very well, what happened next?Sahwit:\nI quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, you didn\'t touch ANYTHING in the apartment?\nSahwit:\nUm, yes. I mean no! Nothing.\nPhoenix:\nOkay. What happened next?Sahwit:\nI thought to call the police immediately!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou "thought" to call the police? Does that mean you didn\'t actually call them!?\nPayne:\nPlease, please... Listen to the rest of the testimony. You thought to call the police... What happened next?Sahwit:\nHowever, the phone in her apartment wasn\'t working.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nThe phone in her apartment wasn\'t working?\nSahwit:\nYes. I mean, no. No, it wasn\'t. Right. (Changed from [Yes. I mean, no, no it wasn\'t. Right.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nBut you said you didn\'t go into the apartment... or did you!?\nSahwit:\nOh, oh, that? I can explain that! There was a cordless phone on a shelf in the entranceway. I reached inside and tried using that to call...\nPayne:\nAnd the phone wasn\'t working, correct? What happened next?Sahwit:\nI went to a nearby park and found a public phone.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWhy use a public phone?\nSahwit:\nWell, you see, I don\'t have a cell phone. And, being the middle of the afternoon, there was no answer at the nearby apartments.\nPhoenix:\nAh, right... what time did you call again?Sahwit:\nI remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n1:00 PM! Are you certain?\nSahwit:\nYes. Absolutely.\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm... He seems really confident.)\nMia:\n1:00 PM? Wright. Doesn\'t that seem strange to you? Present some evidence to contradict him!Present Cindy\'s Autopsy Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n"You found the body at 1:00 PM. You\'re sure?"Sahwit:\nThe man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you absolutely, 100% positive?\nSahwit:\nYes, it was him. No mistake about it.\nPayne:\nThe witness says he\'s certain!Mia:\nThat\'s all of it. There must be a contradiction in there somewhere. Examine the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab] if something strikes you as being suspicious. (Changed from [Examine the Court Record button if something strikes you as being suspicious.] in the original release) Then, find the evidence that contradicts his testimony, and present it to the court!Phoenix:\nYou found the body at 1:00 PM. You\'re sure?Sahwit:\nYes. It was 1:00 PM, for certain.Phoenix:\nFrankly, I find that hard to believe! Your statement directly contradicts the autopsy report. The autopsy notes the time of death at sometime after 4PM. There was nobody to... er... no "body" to find at 1:00 PM! How do you explain this three-hour gap?Sahwit:\n!!! Oh, that! Oh, er...Payne:Payne:\nThis is trivial! The witness merely forgot the time!Judge:\nAfter his testimony, I find that hard to believe. Mr. Sahwit... Why were you so certain that you found the body at 1:00 PM?Sahwit:\nI... er... well, I... Gee, that\'s a really good question!Mia:\nGreat job, Wright! Way to put him on the spot! That\'s all you have to do: point out contradictions! Lies always beget more lies! See through one, and their whole story falls apart!Sahwit:\nWait! I remember now!Judge:\nWould you care to give your testimony again?Witness Testimony-- The Time of Discovery --Sahwit:\nYou see, when I found the body, I heard the time.\nThere was a voice saying the time... It was probably coming from the television.\nOh, but it was three hours off, wasn\'t it?\nI guess the victim must have been watching a video of a taped program!\nThat\'s why I thought it was 1:00 PM!\nTerribly sorry about the misunderstanding...Judge:\nHmm... I see. You heard a voice saying the time on a taped program. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Mia:\nWright! You know what to do!Phoenix:\nI\'ve got this one.Cross Examination-- The Time of Discovery --Sahwit:\nYou see, when I found the body, I heard the time.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nYou said "heard"... Not "saw"?\nSahwit:\nYes, heard. All I saw was the body lying there... I didn\'t think to look at anything else, least of all my watch.\nPhoenix:\nHmm... Isn\'t that a little strange? So you\'re saying you "heard" something. But if you were so shocked by the body, you wouldn\'t hear anything at all!\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nThe witness did say he actually heard the time. It\'s ludicrous to suggest he "wouldn\'t hear anything"!\nJudge:\nHmm... I have to agree with the prosecution. Witness, continue your testimony.Present Blackout Record\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n"Hold it right there!"Sahwit:\nThere was a voice saying the time... It was probably coming from the television.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure it was a television and not... a radio?\nSahwit:\nWell, no, I guess it might have been a radio.\nPayne:\nIncidentally, there was no radio on the premises. There was only one large television.\nMia:\nWright! I can\'t put my finger on it, but something about this seems fishy. Something about "hearing" the television...\nPayne:\nThe witness has testified. He heard the time.Present Blackout Record\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n"Hold it right there!"Sahwit:\nOh, but it was three hours off, wasn\'t it?Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nHow do you explain the gap!\nJudge:\nWell, witness? Can you explain this?Present Blackout Record\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n"Hold it right there!"Sahwit:\nI guess the victim must have been watching a video of a taped program!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nA... video?\nSahwit:\nYes, that would explain why the time was wrong!\nPhoenix:\nTrue, true...\nMia:\nWright! I think the problem lies someplace else...\nJudge:\nWe\'re agreed that you heard the time at the scene, then.Present Blackout Record\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n"Hold it right there!"Sahwit:\nThat\'s why I thought it was 1:00 PM!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nAre you sure the voice you heard said it was 1:00 PM?\nSahwit:\nYes, I can practically hear it now. It was quite clear.\nJudge:\nMr. Payne, has the prosecution verified this testimony?\nPayne:\nMy apologies, Your Honor. I, too, have only just learned that the witness "heard" the time.\nSahwit:\nOh, I\'m really sorry. I only remembered it just now.Present Blackout Record\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nLeads to:\n"Hold it right there!"Sahwit:\nTerribly sorry about the misunderstanding...Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, you just watch it! (Hmm... Not much point pressing him on that one, was there?)Mia:\nNotice anything suspicious?Phoenix:\nHold it right there! The prosecution has said there was a blackout at the time of the discovery! And this record proves it!Sahwit:\n...!Phoenix:\nYou couldn\'t have heard a television... or a video!Sahwit:\nGah!!! I... well... urk!Judge:\nThe defense has a point. Do you have an explanation for this, Mr. Sahwit?Sahwit:\nNo, I... I find it quite puzzling myself! Quite! ... Aah! W-wait! I remember now!Judge:\nMr. Sahwit? The court would prefer to hear an accurate testimony from the very beginning. These constant corrections are harming your credibility. That, and you seem rather... distraught.Sahwit:\n...! M-my apologies, Your Honor! It... er, it must have been the shock of finding the body!Judge:\nVery well, Mr. Sahwit. Let\'s hear your testimony once more please.Witness Testimony-- Hearing the Time --Sahwit:\nActually, I didn\'t "hear" the time... I "saw" it!\nThere was a table clock in the apartment, wasn\'t there!\nYeah, the murder weapon! The killer used it to hit the victim!\nThat must have been what I saw.Judge:\nYou saw a clock? I guess that would explain it. The defense may cross-examine the witness.Phoenix:\nGladly.Cross Examination'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o'}}

Below are the witness' testimonies:
0: The crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.
1: Poor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her.
2: The victim didn't have any identification on him.
3: But we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly.
4: When Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison.
5: And that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene.
Below are the evidences you have:

Part 4Episode 3Recipe for TurnaboutJudge:
That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts.I-It wasn't me! I swear it wasn't me!Judge:
The evidence and testimony we have seen and heard are conclusive! The victim was alone at his table when he drank from that poisoned cup of coffee.No! You're wrong! I know what I saw...! I saw... I saw...! I saw someone else there! A man. He's the real killer! Why won't anyone believe me?Payne:
Well... I'd say that pretty much wraps this case up, wouldn't you... ...Mr. Wright!?Judge:
This court finds the defendant...GuiltyJudge:
The court is adjourned.January 6, 10:03 AMWright & Co. Law OfficesMaya:
Ahh! The start of the new year always makes me feel like I can take on the whole world!Phoenix:
I bet it does, Maya.Maya:
So! I've decided that our resolution should be... Zvarri! "Take on the world!" What do you think?Phoenix:
Sure, whatever, Maya... But I think maybe you've had more than enough mistletoe cake.Maya:
Never! You've got to eat a lot of cake during New Year's! It's practically a tradition! Like watching the fireworks on TV or playing a board game.???:
HEY, PAL!Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe...Maya:
Happy New Year, Detective!Gumshoe:
Uh... likewise... NOW LISTEN UP, WRIGHT! I WANNA...Maya:
Here's to another fruitful year of lawyer-police cooperation!Gumshoe:
Um... Yeah... Me too... ALRIGHT, PAL! YOU'VE GOT SOME EXPLAINING TO...Maya:
Have you got a holiday present for me, Detective?Gumshoe:
A what? Well... I, um... Here, have this. It-It's really nothing much, but...Maya:
Yay! Thanks!Gumshoe:
LOOK, PAL, WE NEED TO HAVE A TALK. TAKE A SEAT!Maya:
Hey! What about Pearly? You haven't forgotten her present, have you?Gumshoe:
Ah... N-No... I mean, yes... I mean, no... Are you doing this on purpose?Maya:
Ha ha, guess I'm busted. How did you like my first practical joke of the year?Gumshoe:
Very funny, pal. Now let's see how funny you think it is when I show you this!Phoenix:
What is it? A magazine?Maya:
Hey, I wanna see! "Deadly Poisoning Brings Guilty Verdict. Defense Attorney Wright Trounced."Phoenix:
Tr-Trounced!? Let me see that! "The defense attorney gave an almost childishly amateur performance yesterday..." What the heck is this!?Gumshoe:
It's a report, pal. About you!Maya:
Listen to this! "Mr. Wright must take full responsibility for the ruling in this case."Gumshoe:
WELL!? And don't tell me you don't remember anything about it!Phoenix:
But I don't remember anything about it! When was that issue from anyway?Gumshoe:
Umm... December of last year, which I guess makes it last month.Maya:
Which makes it old news, you mean.Phoenix:
But I wasn't involved in a poisoning case in December!Maya:
Hmm, so what do you think this is all about, Nick?Gumshoe:
If it wasn't you, pal, then that leaves only one possibility...Maya:
No way. You don't mean...Phoenix:
A pho...Maya:
A phony Nick!?Phoenix:
(This must be Gumshoe's idea of a joke. Guess he's starting off the year with one, too...)Magazine Clipping added to the Court Record.Gumshoe:
SO!? What are you gonna do about it, pal!?Phoenix:
What do you mean, what am I going to do about it?Maya:
Well, it's your fault that the judge found the defendant guilty in this case!Phoenix:
My fault!? How do you figure that?Maya:
Because THE Phoenix Wright is super famous now! Well, maybe only sort of...Gumshoe:
Yeah. See what happens when you hotshots start getting too full of yourselves?Phoenix:
(But I didn't do anything wrong! ...At least, not that I can remember...)Gumshoe:
You better make this right, pal. Now! And that means taking the case back to court. Got it?Maya:
Sounds like we've got our first case of the new year! Let's tackle it with gusto!Phoenix:
I don't know... The judge already issued a guilty verdict once in this case. It's not going to be easy to get it overturned.Maya:
... I guess that New Year's resolution is going to have to wait until next year.Gumshoe:
So you're taking the case, right!? Good! I'm gonna head over to the courthouse then. After that, I'll go back to the precinct. Drop by if you need something, OK pal!?Phoenix:
(I guess people are starting to know the name "Phoenix Wright". If a client entrusted a case to me based on my reputation... I guess I am kind of responsible. But why would someone want to impersonate me? What sort of a guy would do that?)Examine









Bookshelf







Phoenix:
Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. ...Actually, I've neglected them for so long that they're covered in a layer of dust. I guess I should at least pretend to read them once in a while.




Charley the plant







Phoenix:
Charley. A quite decorative plant. He's sort of a keepsake... something to remember Mia by. Sure, the office is a mess, but I never forget to water this little fella.




Desk







Phoenix:
It's my desk. I don't get to use it much, so it's still super neat and tidy from when Pearls cleaned it.




Movie poster







Phoenix:
An old movie poster. Apparently, this was the first movie that made Mia cry when she saw it, a long time ago. Maya watched it recently, and said she cried all night, too! ...Which, I guess, is why it's back up on the wall. I have to check it out one of these days.




Window







Phoenix:
There is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. The chain is getting so rich that they bought a whole chunk of the next town over... ...and started building a huge theme park. It's going to be called "Gatewater Land". ...I wonder if that bellboy is going to send me a greeting card this year, too?Talk









What to do







Maya:
So, what's our first move?
Phoenix:
I guess we go down to the detention center and talk--
Maya:
Wait a sec, Nick. This person's behind bars because of you. Whoever it is isn't going to be jumping at the chance to meet you, right?
Phoenix:
Hey, hey! Let's get one thing straight. It wasn't me, it was a fake me that did this!
Maya:
Hmm, I wonder if he looks exactly like you... Your phony, Xin Eohp, I mean.
Phoenix:
(I hope not. *shudder* ...And what kind of name for an evil double is Xin Eohp anyway!?)
Maya:
Ah! Nick! I've got it!
Phoenix:
If you're going to ask whether I've got a twin brother, the answer is no.
Maya:
...Spoilsport.




Any ideas







Maya:
Did you notice Gumshoe was acting weirder than usual, or was it just me?
Phoenix:
What do you mean?
Maya:
I mean, he was really worked up. Like a guy who's just found out he's going to be a dad or something.
Phoenix:
Yeah, I guess he was acting kind of strange.
Maya:
Maybe he realized he's got strong feelings for you, Nick!
Phoenix:
... Considering how we interact, I seriously doubt that, Maya...
Maya:
Well, if he wasn't nervous because of you...
Phoenix:
...then maybe it's because of our new guilty client?Present









Attorney's Badge







Maya:
So you've still got that badge, I see.
Phoenix:
Huh!? Well, I'm a lawyer, aren't I?
Maya:
Yeah, but I guess I just didn't think you'd keep on being one for this long. You have to admit, you've had some close brushes with death because of your job.
Phoenix:
(...I fail to see how being a lawyer is more dangerous than channeling dead people.)




Magazine Clipping







Maya:
I can't believe you've got an impersonator.
Phoenix:
I can't either. *sigh*
Maya:
Aww, but look on the bright side. Only famous stars have people impersonating them!
Phoenix:
This isn't funny, Maya. It's not just an impersonation. This guy stole my identity! And someone may have been wrongly convicted as a result.
Maya:
...Guess you should've gone into showbiz, huh, Nick?
Phoenix:
(...*sigh* I will never understand how your mind works, Maya.)




Maya Fey profile







Phoenix:
So? How's your spirit medium training going?
Maya:
Well... I stand under the rushing waters of the shower head every day.
Phoenix:
...That's called "taking a shower". What happened to the rushing waters of a waterfall?
Maya:
Well, I'm kind of taking a break... I'm having a bit of trouble right now, you know?
Phoenix:
(Last year's incident must still be on her mind... I haven't seen Maya train at all since that time. I think Mia said it's because Maya's at a loss these days...)




Mia Fey profile







Phoenix:
Mia helped me out in court again last time.
Maya:
It's so cool that you get to meet my sis like that.
Phoenix:
Yeah...
Maya:
We mediums lose consciousness when we're channeling, so I don't get to see my sis...
Phoenix:
...I never really thought about it that way. Hey! If you want to meet Mia... ...why don't we just have Pearls call her?
Maya:
No... I couldn't do that. I'd be too worried about her.
Phoenix:
(I guess Maya's got all sorts of things to think about, too. ...Despite her immaturity saying otherwise.)




Godot profile







Maya:
So you still can't remember anything about Godot, huh?
Phoenix:
I already told you. I have no idea who he is, let alone why he dislikes me so much.
Maya:
Well he sure seems to have a problem with you for some reason. You'd better watch your back, Nick. Coffee lovers can be quite bitter.
Phoenix:
You're just making that up, Maya!




Dick Gumshoe profile







Maya:
Digging up an old case that's already been ruled on... That's not like Gumshoe, is it?
Phoenix:
No. He barely manages to stay on top of the cases in front of him.
Maya:
Yeah, he's always busy, and gets dirt pay. I mean, look at that dusty old coat he wears!
Phoenix:
(Did you mean he "gets paid dirt" or do you really think they pay him in gravel?)




Any other evidence







Phoenix:
Do you know anything about this, Maya?
Maya:
Hmm... Even someone as worldly-wise as me doesn't know everything about everything, Nick. So I, the great Maya, am sad to say I can't tell you much about this object.
Phoenix:
(A simple yes or no, Maya... It's not as if you had to give me a dissertation...)




Any other profile







Phoenix:
Do you know anything about this person?
Maya:
Hmm... Even someone as worldly-wise as me doesn't know everything about everyone, Nick. So I, the great Maya, am sad to say I can't tell you much about this individual.
Phoenix:
(A simple yes or no, Maya... It's not as if you had to give me a dissertation...)January 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept.Maya:
It's been ages since we came down to the precinct, huh, Nick?Phoenix:
Looks like Gumshoe isn't around.Maya:
He's got it so easy, leaving everyone else to do the work!Phoenix:
No, he's been out there somewhere. My bet is on the courthouse. He's probably trying to arrange the retrial of this case.Maya:
Guess that means we should go to the detention center and chat with our killer, huh?Phoenix:
After being convicted without a fair trial, I'm not sure killer is the right label...Examine









Detective on left







Phoenix:
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
Detective:
"Don't die running a red light. Die the old-fashioned way -- of old age!" We have a winner! Inject a bit of humor, that's the key.
Phoenix:
... He must be coming up with slogans for a safety campaign. ...I guess?




Desks







Phoenix:
These are the detectives' desks. There are computers and files on each one. Funny, they're a lot tidier than I expected. I guess the detectives don't spend a lot of time at their desks.




Poster







Phoenix:
A poster of a female police officer... Wait, no. That's the latest "Babes in Uniform" calendar. My bad.




Chief







Phoenix:
This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen.
Chief:
WHAT! Mask☆DeMasque turned up at the bank? What's he doing!? "Hands up, you scalawags!" "You're under arrest!" Hey! That's our job!
Phoenix:
(Looks like Ron DeLite's opted for a new career.)
Detective:
Quit surfing the net, Chief!
Chief:
S-Sorry... I was just, um...
Phoenix:
(Things feel pretty tense in here...)




Badgers







Maya:
Hey, that's the police mascot, isn't it? It's so cute!
Chief:
That's the "Blue Badger". It was my idea! I made it! And now, it's the national symbol of the police force!
Phoenix:
So what's with the pink one? It's new, right?
Maya:
She's not an "it", Nick. She's a "she", right Chief?
Chief:
Yup. Meet the "Pink Badger".
Maya:
So one's called "Blue", and the other's called "Pink", but they're both called "Badger"?
Chief:
You got it! They're both married.
Maya:
Umm... Mr. & Mrs. Badger seem to be cuffed together, Chief.
Chief:
You got it! That's marriage for you!
Phoenix:
(Whoa... A mascot that's deeper than the deepest of deep oceans...)January 6Detention CenterVisitor's RoomMaya:
This is so nerve-wracking, waiting to meet our new client. I wonder just what kind of person you tricked and got found guilty...?Phoenix:
K-Keep it down, Maya! That kind of talk could ruin me!???:
Aaaaaaaah! How could you, Mr. Wright!? How could you do this to me!? They put me in solitary! I haven't been able to stop crying.Phoenix:
A-Aren't... you...???:
Yes, I am! I am totally and utterly let down!Maya:
Aah! You're... Are you...????
Don't pretend you don't know me! It's me, Maggey, remember!? Maggey Byrde!Phoenix:
Maggey Byrde... Ah! (Maggey Byrde... She's the policewoman I defended that one time. She was accused of murdering her lover. He was a cop, too.) What are you doing in here!? Didn't I get you acquitt--Byrde:
Oh, sure! Very funny! After that fifth-rate defense job, you come in here and start making jokes!?Maya:
You better hurry up and tell her what happened, Nick.Byrde:
O-Oh... I see...Phoenix:
So that's where we stand right now.Maya:
I'm sorry you've been caught up in another murder...Byrde:
My whole life has been nothing but a whirlwind of bad luck and failures.Phoenix:
(I vaguely remember her saying the exact same thing last time...)Byrde:
But I don't mind! What's one more disaster in my life? At least now the real Mr. Wright is here with me. I won't let the world keep me down, sir!Examine









Surveillance camera







Phoenix:
Smile, you're on candid camera.




Guard







Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. I bet they don't get too many waitresses in here. He looks like he's getting a bit restless.Talk









Maggey Byrde







Maya:
So, how come you're dressed like that, Maggey? Last year you looked so sharp in that police uniform.
Byrde:
Hmph. I was fired after that... incident last year.
Maya:
Oh. I'm sorry.
Byrde:
It's OK. I don't mind one bit. I enjoyed being on the force, but I think it was time for me to move on.
Maya:
So, what do you do now?
Byrde:
In the second act of "The Life of Maggey Byrde", I'm playing the role of a waitress!
Maya:
A waitress!?
Byrde:
Yes. In a French restaurant. It's a small place, but it's quite fashionable. My charming smile and shapely figure came through for me. And the owner, Mr. Armstrong, hired me straight away, sir.
Phoenix:
And then you got into this mess straight away, right?
Byrde:
Yeah, you could put it that way...




What happened







Byrde:
This whole mess started on the 3rd of last month... And it happened at Trés Bien.
Maya:
"Treh Bee-an"...?
Byrde:
Yes. It's a restaurant where good service and a friendly smile are always included!
Maya:
Oh...
Byrde:
There were two men at the table, both drinking coffee. And then... One of the men slipped some poison into the victim's cup! The victim took just one sip and was gasping for air! I was so shocked, I passed out.
Maya:
Hey, hold on there, Maggey.
Byrde:
What?
Maya:
You keep calling the guy, "the victim". Didn't you know the guy who was killed?
Byrde:
Not at all! I'd never even seen the guy before!
Maya:
Oh...
Phoenix:
(So she wouldn't have a motive to kill him then, I guess...) And the other man, the killer. You saw him, right?
Byrde:
Of course! A good waitress must be attentive to the clientele.
Phoenix:
So, you saw the killer, but you were found guilty of the crime anyway? How come?
Byrde:
......... You tell me, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Ack! (Guess the answer to my question is "my phony"... Anyway, she saw the killer. Better see if I can get a description of the guy.)




Guilty verdict (appears after "What happened")







Maya:
So, if you saw the murderer, why were you still convicted?
Byrde:
Because no one else saw.
Maya:
Saw what?
Byrde:
The other man. The one who put the poison in the victim's coffee. Everyone testified that way. Mr. Armstrong, the customer... Everyone. "The victim was sitting alone at his table the whole time."
Phoenix:
But how's that possible?
Byrde:
I don't know. But nobody, not one person, would believe me, sir. Even Phoenix Wright, my one last hope for a fair trial, failed me. What a pathetic defense! My granny could've done a better job!
Phoenix:
Look! That wasn't me, OK?
Byrde:
And then! ...They found something a bit incriminating in my apron pocket.
Maya:
What?
Byrde:
A small bottle... of poison.
Maya:
WHAT!? P-Poison!? It was in your pocket!?
Byrde:
Well, I passed out when the victim collapsed. The killer must've slipped the poison into my pocket when I was unconscious.
Phoenix:
And no one else saw this other guy?
Byrde:
No, sir. That's what everyone said. But I don't see how they could've missed him...




The other guy (appears after "Guilty verdict")







Byrde:
I was the one who took the coffee to the two men.
Phoenix:
O-Oh...? And what was your impression of them?
Byrde:
Well... When I first saw them, I kind of thought they might be in the music industry.
Maya:
In music? How come?
Byrde:
Well, one of them had some sort of earpiece, and an emo musician's look about him. And there was a sample CD on the table, sir.
Maya:
An earpiece and a sample CD, huh? Did you get a look at the CD at all?
Byrde:
It had a band's name written on it. I think it was "MC"-something. They must've been preparing for their debut, I guess.
Phoenix:
So it was a band's CD. Maybe a promo disc?
Maya:
Maybe it was "MC Screwdriver"!
Phoenix:
Get serious, Maya. Would you buy the CD of a group named that?
Byrde:
Nngh... What was the name of that group again...? "MC Hacksaw..."? No... "MC..."
Maya:
And what about the killer? What did he look like?
Byrde:
Well, I, um... I don't really remember. Only that he was a young man. Well-built like the victim, really.Present









Attorney's Badge







Byrde:
That badge! Is it real?
Phoenix:
Of course it's real!
Byrde:
That's what they all say. But I've been duped before. Give it to me for a sec!
Phoenix:
Ah...!
...*chomp!*
Maya:
She... She bit into it...
Byrde:
And I left a few teeth marks, too!
Phoenix:
I can see that...
Byrde:
I just wish I could remember if that means it's real or a fake.
Phoenix:
*sigh* (I said it was real!)




Magazine Clipping







Phoenix:
Oh, yeah. I need to ask you about this...
Byrde:
Hey! This article's about my case!
Phoenix:
Can you tell me anything about the guy who was pretending to be me?
Byrde:
Yes, sir! It was the morning after I'd been arrested... I met you in the visitor's room here. You were wearing one of your super-sharp suits.
Phoenix:
Me?
Byrde:
Yes, you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Argh...
Maya:
Hey, Maggey! Was my evil double Ayam here, too?
Byrde:
No. I don't remember a phony you, Maya.
Maya:
Oh... *sigh* It would've been so cool...
Byrde:
Then you got really worked up and passionate. "I'm gonna get you' cleared'a dis crime!" you said. (Changed from ['I'm gonna get you cleared of this crime!' you said.] in the original release)
Phoenix:
OK, I get the picture. But you've met me in person before... So how come you didn't realize that guy wasn't the real me?
Byrde:
... I guess, looking back now, it was a little strange...
Phoenix:
Only a little?
Byrde:
Well, OK, so you were a bit taller than normal. And you looked a bit shady. And your voice was a bit weird. Oh, and you had this funny accent. And...
Phoenix:
So the guy was nothing like me, then!?
Byrde:
But he had your spiky hair and blue suit.
Phoenix:
(... Is that all it takes for someone to imitate me...?)
Maya:
How about everyone else in the courtroom, like the judge and the observers...? Didn't they realize he was an imposter?
Byrde:
Everyone had these big question marks on their faces... But it seemed that no one wanted to say anything, sir.
Maya:
This case just keeps getting weirder and weirder...




Maya Fey profile







Byrde:
Thanks for your help last year!
Maya:
Aw, it was nothing. I'm glad we got you off the hook.
Byrde:
I hope you can help me out this year, too!
Maya:
Yeah, me too. It's be sweet if we could get that verdict overturned.




Dick Gumshoe profile







Byrde:
Oh, Detective Gumshoe! He really looked out for me when I was on the force!
Phoenix:
Have you seen him recently?
Byrde:
No. He's never been to the restaurant.
Maya:
Guess he's not a fan of French cuisine, huh? He's an instant noodle type of guy, after all.
Byrde:
Yeah, he prefers the simple things in life.
Phoenix:
(...Or he's just simply too poor to afford anything else.)




Maggey Byrde profile







Byrde:
No matter what happens, I never let anything get me down!
Maya:
You're always so positive, aren't you, Maggey?
Byrde:
Macho Maggey Byrde, they say! The early Byrde catches the worm! A Byrde in the hand!
Maya:
Wow! All those phrases are named after you?
Byrde:
And I never turn my back on anything!
Maya:
You're always so strong, aren't you, Maggey?
Byrde:
Macho Maggey Byrde, they say! I'm a tough old Byrde!
Maya:
"Tough old byrde", Nick! Hee hee! Do you get it?
Phoenix:
...Yeah, I get it.




Anything else







Byrde:
I know I used to be on the police force, sir. But I'm incarcerated, now. So I can't use my connections to help you. All I can tell you about now is info about ex-cons or the clientele of Trés Bien, sir...
Maya:
Aww, don't let it get you down, Maggey!After clearing all Talk options and presenting Magazine Clipping:Byrde:
Mr. Wright... Do you think it's possible to get a retrial?Phoenix:
Probably. The court ruled in the absence of a genuine defense attorney. So we should be able to get a retrial.Byrde:
Um... Mr. Wright...?Phoenix:

Do you think we'll win next time? ...Sir?Phoenix:
...!Byrde:
My life has been a full course meal of bad luck, complete with defeat for dessert. Since I was 6 months old, when I fell from the 9th floor of my apartment building... ...I've been hit by all sorts of vehicles, gotten sick from all sorts of foods... ...failed at almost every test I've taken, experienced almost every kind of disaster... I even landed a phony lawyer when I had the misfortune of being accused of murder. But! I will survive! Because Maggey Byrde always lives to fight another day! And one day, I'll find it! Just you wait and see, sir! I'll find that one, single moment of good luck!Maya:
Argh, Xin Eohp is really gonna pay for this!Phoenix:
Wh-What are you staring at me like that for...? (But Maya's right... Whoever it is that thought it was a good idea to use my name... ...and get an innocent girl convicted of murder had better watch out!)Maya:
We'll find him! Don't you worry. We'll get Xin Eohp for you!Byrde:
Thank you! Oh! I'll tell you where Trés Bien is then!Phoenix:

Yes, sir. When you go, please tell Mr. Armstrong I said hi!Maya:
Sure! Alright, Nick! Let's go check out this restaurant and its food!January 6Trés BienMaya:
Wow! Look at this place.Phoenix:

Actually, I'm not all that into it...Phoenix:
...Maya:
... No one's coming to seat us. Maybe there's no one here.Phoenix:
Don't be silly, Maya. This is a restaurant, and it's open for business. HELLO! ANYONE HERE? ... I don't believe it! There really isn't anyone here!Maya:
Perfect! Let's get intrusive! If there's no one here, we can take anything we want!Phoenix:

Cash register







Maya:
Look, it's one of those magical boxes that spits out money.
Phoenix:
You know, you're the only person who would ever describe a cash register in that way!




Trinkets







Maya:
Look at all the little trinkets tucked away in here.
Phoenix:
I bet Mr. Armstrong collected all of these personally. Let's see... A bouquet of flowers, some potpourri, and look! Fine bone china cups!
Maya:
... I never knew you were so... cultured.
Phoenix:
Come on, Maya! This is common knowledge! Any Joe Schmoe knows this much!




Front entrance







Phoenix:
It's the restaurant's front entrance. There's a sign hanging on the door written in French. It probably says, "Open" or "Closed". It must be one or the other, but I don't know which since I dunno Jacques about French.




Magazine rack







Maya:
It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French.
Phoenix:
Why don't you try wearing something a bit more "chic" something, huh, Maya?
Maya:
Yeah. I guess I could. I'm always in my acolyte clothes, aren't I? It'd be fun to wear normal clothes every now and then.
Phoenix:
Hm? There's something stuffed in behind the rack.
Maya:
...Looks like a sports paper to me. Hey, and look at this! Someone's scribbled a little doodle on one of the pages. "MC Bomber", and one, two, three, four, five zeros... A-A hundred thousand... dollars... maybe?
Phoenix:
I wonder what "MC Bomber" is supposed to be...? ! (This paper! It's from December 3rd...) This paper's from the day of the poisoning!
Maya:
WHAT!?
Sports Paper added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(A paper from the day of the murder... This has got to be a clue! I should see if I can find out some more about this paper...)




Magazine rack (subsequent times)







Maya:
It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French.
Phoenix:
Looks like Mr. Armstrong doesn't get any newspapers.
Maya:
Well, it wouldn't exactly suit the feel of the place, would it?
Phoenix:
Why don't you try wearing something a bit more "chic" like in these mags, Maya?
Maya:
Yeah. I'd look stunning in some of those Parisian frocks, huh?
Phoenix:
(We found that sports paper behind this magazine rack earlier... I'd better try to find out everything I can about it...)




Table







Phoenix:
This table's set nicely. It just needs a customer.
Maya:
What do you think this flower is, Nick?
Phoenix:
Let's see... Well, it doesn't look like a tulip, and it's not a sunflower, I don't think...
Maya:
Duh. Even I could've told you that.
Phoenix:
Well, those are the only kinds of flowers I know. Dagnabit, I'm a lawyer, not a botanist!




Windows







Phoenix:
Wow! It's a beautiful winter wonderland out there.
Maya:
Really!? Cool! I love snow! Let me see! Huh? It's not white. It's not even snowing.
Phoenix:
Got you! I was only kidding, Maya.
Maya:
Nick! There are lies that are OK to tell, and lies that definitely aren't.
Phoenix:
(...All I did was tell an itty-bitty white lie about nonexistent white snow.)




Partition







Phoenix:
This restaurant has partitions that separate the tables. When you're seated at a table, you can only see the tables to your right or left.




Crime scene







Phoenix:
This must be the table where the murder occurred.
Maya:
I guess so, with all this police tape all around it.
Phoenix:
And that stain must be from the poisoned coffee. Don't go licking the tablecloth, OK, Maya?
Maya:
Why would I lick it? I'm not a cat, you know!

Sports Paper







Maya:
Hmm... "MC Bomber"...
Phoenix:
And don't forget the "100,000", too.
Maya:
There's something about that name, "MC Bomber".
Phoenix:
Yeah, It's a pretty unusual name.
Phoenix:
And don't forget the "100,000", too.
Maya:
Everyone's worried about bombs these days, I guess.
Phoenix:
I'm not sure that has any bearing on anything related to this case...)
Maya:
Anyway, we should really look into this some more!




Maggey Byrde profile







Maya:
This is Maggey's second time as a murder suspect, huh?
Phoenix:
Yeah. The first time was a little over a year ago... She was on the police force back then.

Sports Paper







Byrde:
Oh! A sports paper. Let's see, let's see... Did Gutsen Brawn manage to defend his heavyweight title?
Phoenix:
Sorry, Maggey. That paper is actually a month old... It's from the day of the murder...
Maya:
And Gutsen got knocked out yesterday, I'm afraid.
Byrde:
Oh, no...
Phoenix:
I found this paper in the magazine rack at Trés Bien.
Byrde:
Really? That's strange... Trés Bien doesn't get newspapers. Mr. Armstrong says he's not really fond of them.
Maya:
Then maybe one of the customers left it behind?
Phoenix:
Anyway, what I want you to take a look at is this scribble here.
Byrde:
Ah-ha! That's it, sir! "MC Bomber"! That was the name that was written on the CD!
Phoenix:
(Just as I thought...)
Maya:
I guess it wasn't "MC Screwdriver" after all, huh...
Byrde:
So, that $100,000 must be a down payment for a record deal, right?
Maya:
If someone gave me $100,000, I'd sing for sure! "The Master of Kurain" or "The Spirit Song" or even "Maya's Theme"!
Phoenix:
Um, OK, Maya... So, if the sample CD was on the victim's table... That means this newspaper may have belonged to the victim!
Maya:
You're right!
Phoenix:
(So the victim left this behind on the day of the murder, huh...)

Trés Bien







Maya:
So what does "Trés Bien" mean? I know "trés". That means "three", right?
Armstrong:
Non, non, non! "Trés Bien" is Français! In English, you would say, "Very Good".
Maya:
Oh. Very good...
Armstrong:
Oui, exactement! La atmosphere is trés bien, and la cuisine is trés bien!
Phoenix:
(If the food's good, why aren't there any customers in here?)
Armstrong:
My cuisine is not for all. Some people, z'ey do not appreciate la haute cuisine.
Phoenix:
(I thought everyone liked hot cuisine...)
Armstrong:
Since I 'ave lost Maggey, I do not 'ave enough 'ands.
Phoenix:
So, you're running this place on your own now?
Armstrong:
Oui. For la moment. No one 'as answered my advertisement. Oh, poor moi!
Phoenix:
(... Please don't eyeball me while you say that.)
Armstrong:
I am la chef. I am la manager. I am also a trained aromatherapist.
Maya:
A roaming what?
Armstrong:
A practitioner d'aromatherapy. La art of soothing la soul wiz z'e delicate floral aromas.
Phoenix:
(Delicate? The smell coming from that bottle earlier was anything but...)




What happened







Phoenix:
So, could you tell me what you know about the incident?
Armstrong:
Bien. It makes me sad to remember it, yet I remember it so well. More z'an a month 'as passed since it 'appened.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, I guess it's been about a month since Maggey's sentencing...)
Armstrong:
So. It was z'e third of last month. Just after one in z'e afternoon. A man who was in 'ere for a coffee suddenly became ill.
Phoenix:
Because of the poison in his coffee?
Armstrong:
Z'at is la truth as I know it. It was Maggey who took 'is drink to 'im. I was in la kitchen. I 'eard z'e sound of someone collapsing. When I came out to see what it was, 'e was already slumped in 'is chair.
Maya:
He was dead?
Armstrong:
Mon dieu! Oui! 'E was dead! Maggey 'ad passed out also.
Phoenix:
And this man who died... Was he alone?
Armstrong:
Oui, monsieur. All alone. I know z'at Maggey said z'ere was someone else, but...
Maya:
I see...
Armstrong:
La police, z'ey asked me many times. "Are you sure z'ere was no one else at z'e table?" z'ey asked. But I am not z'e only one. La old man said z'e same thing.
Phoenix:
Old man? What old man?




Old man (appears after "What happened")







Phoenix:
Um... So who is the old man that you mentioned?
Armstrong:
At z'e time of la murder, z'ere was another customer in 'ere.
Maya:
What!? Someone else saw it?
Armstrong:
Mais, oui! As usual, 'e came alone z'at day. At z'e time of la murder, 'e was 'ere. 'E saw it, too. But 'e said z'e same thing, z'at z'ere was no one else at la victim's table.
Maya:
But Maggey swears there were two people!
Armstrong:
Mais, mademoiselle. La lawyer, 'e could not prove z'is, non?
Phoenix:
About the lawyer. That was me, I suppose?
Armstrong:
Mais bien sûr!
Phoenix:
... Wow! He's the first person who's said it wasn't me.
Maya:
Don't kid yourself, Nick! Hmph. Now who's the one making stuff up!?




Maggey's motive (appears after presenting Maggey Byrde profile)







Phoenix:
When Maggey took the coffee over to the victim... ...did anything happen?
Armstrong:
Ou... Oui. I-I suppose you could say so.
Phoenix:
So what happened?
Armstrong:
Non. It was, er... It was nothing.
Maya:
Look, Maggey says she didn't even know the guy! But she's still been indicted for murder! The prosecution must have come up with some kind of motive!
Armstrong:
Oui. It is true.
Phoenix:
If there was anything at all between Maggey and the victim, it could be relevant.
Maya:
So please! Tell us anything you know.

3 PSYCHE-LOCKS

Phoenix:

I had it in my pocket, but... It has vanished into thin air!
Maya:
WHAT!?
Phoenix:
(But I could see the Psyche-Locks. (Changed from [But I could see the Psyche-Lock.] in the original release) Maybe that means the Magatama's nearby...?)




Maggey's motive (subsequent times)







Phoenix:
Maggey wouldn't just have put poison in the coffee of some guy she didn't even know. If she's really guilty, there must have been something between her and the victim.

3 PSYCHE LOCKS

Armstrong:
N-Non. It was nothing. I am sure. Qué será, será. Perhaps Maggey 'ad another reason.
Phoenix:
(What's Maggey's motive got to do with this chef? Why is he hiding things from me? And another thing... Where did I drop the Magatama? The fact that I can see the lock [sic] must mean it's nearby.)
Maya:
I only loaned it to you, you know. So you better find it, Nick! OK?

Attorney's Badge







Armstrong:
Please, monsieur. Z'ere is no need to show me z'at. You are Mon. Phoenix Wright, z'e worst defense lawyer in town.
Phoenix:

Armstrong:
Oui. You flashed it to everyone in la restaurant!
Maya:
Looks like Xin Eohp is a bigger fan of flashing stuff than you are, Nick!

Armstrong:
I am not a lawyer myself. I do not wish to speak out of turn. But your defense in court z'at day was a little, how you say, "lacking", per'aps?
Phoenix:

Wow, I wonder just how bad the defense could've been...

Armstrong:
Maggey was a policewoman once, n'est-ce pas?
Phoenix:
Yes. But she had to quit for, um, reasons beyond her control.
Armstrong:
Oui, oui. She was la suspect in la murder investigation, non?
Maya:
Oh... You know about that?
Armstrong:
Z'at is why I gave to 'er la perfume for la 'appiness.
Phoenix:
Happiness perfume?
Armstrong:
Oui. Blended from bergamot, like I 'ave given to you before.
Phoenix:
But she's been arrested again. And found guilty this time.
Armstrong:
Z'is is true. 'Er natural aroma of un'appiness must 'ave been very strong.
Phoenix:
(Just admit it! Your perfume doesn't work!)
Armstrong:
I am not surprised she was la prime suspect. After something like z'at took place before my very eyes.
Maya:
Something like what?
Phoenix:
(What's this guy talking about!?)
Maya:
Does this mean... Maggey did have a motive?
Phoenix:
We've got to ask this guy for more info, stat!

Phoenix:

Sandbox







Maya:
I used to love sandboxes like you wouldn't believe!
Phoenix:
Really? You?
Maya:
Sure. Finding iron filings in the sand with a magnet was my favorite thing to do.
Phoenix:
Iron filings? Wow... That's too exciting for words.
Maya:
It was my ambition to collect every single shred of iron in the sandbox. I was such a kid back then!
Phoenix:
So, did you manage to get all the iron?
Maya:
No, I never did. I think I came close, though. Come to think of it, I still have all the iron filings I found way back when. You want them?
Phoenix:
No.




Fruit attractions







Maya:
This place is so fruity!
Phoenix:
That's not a bad thing. Besides, I love apples. They're among my favorites.
Maya:
Then that apple slide is perfect for you!
Phoenix:
... And what is so "perfect" about it?
Maya:
Oh come on. Don't be a stick in the mud! Slide down it a few times. Go on! Woo!
Phoenix:
No way! I'd get covered in sand if I slid down that slide. Anyone can see that.
Maya:
Yeah, you're right. Otherwise, I'd give it a try, too.




Pigeons







Maya:
Hey, look. Pigeons!
Phoenix:
Yeah. And heaps of them, too.
Maya:
Did you know that pigeons are a symbol of peace?
Phoenix:
That's a dove, not a pigeon.
Maya:
... Poor things. Just because they're gray means they can't be symbols of peace and harmony?
Phoenix:
You're over-thinking this one by just a smidge, Maya.




Magazine on orange-themed seat







Maya:
Ooh, there's a magazine here.
Phoenix:
It's a magazine full of job listings.
Old Man:
You disgusting rogue, picking up something someone else threw away!
Phoenix:
"Threw away"? Did you throw this away? Are you looking for a job?
Old Man:
Kah! That's none of your business!
Phoenix:
Sorry! I guess I'll take the magazine with me then.
Old Man:
I don't want anyone else having it! Give it back!
Phoenix:

Maya:
Looking at this orange reminds me...
Phoenix:
Of what?
Maya:

Phoenix:
Um... Excuse me.
Old Man:

Phoenix:
Would you mind if I had a word with you?
Old Man:
Yes!
Phoenix:
I just want to ask you a couple of questions...
Old Man:
What's the matter with you!? Can't you see I'm busy? So you don't like my seeds, eh, pigeons!?

Maggey Byrde







Phoenix:
Excuse me, sir. Can I ask you about Maggey Byrde?
Old Man:
I don't know any Maggey Byrde!
Maya:
Yes, you do. Maggey. The waitress at Trés Bien.
Old Man:
Kah! It's a disgrace, I tell you. An utter disgrace!
Maya:
A disgrace?
Old Man:
An innocent young girl revealing herself like that!
Phoenix:
Revealing!? You mean her uniform?
Old Man:
The youth of today! They don't have any shame! No shame, I tell you! Not one ounce! Whatever happened to the old bushido values of Japan, like honor and modesty?
Maya:
What about me? I'm not wearing anything revealing.
Old Man:
You!? Your problem is you lack any sense of grace!
Maya:
Talk about hitting a girl where it hurts...




Trés Bien







Phoenix:
Do you go to Trés Bien a lot?
Old Man:
Hmph! That miserable excuse for a restaurant? That garbage they serve in there's not food. Where's the sushi? The tempura? The rice!?
Phoenix:
Trés Bien is a French restaurant, sir...
Old Man:
Where do you think we are, boy? In Paris!? I want real food, not those snooty snacks! And what about those shameless girls!?
Phoenix:
You mean the waitresses?
Old Man:
You can see all the way up to their... their... Yes! The waitresses! They're practically naked! It's a disgrace, isn't it? Well, isn't it!?
Phoenix:
Listen, it's not my restaurant.
Old Man:
Kah! It's a miserable excuse for a restaurant, that place! Miserable!
Phoenix:

Trés Bien regular (appears after "Trés Bien")

Old Man:

Byrde:
Oh, are you looking for some part-time work, Maya? Why don't you take a job at the restaurant? I bet Mr. Armstrong would hire you.
Maya:
Really? Me?
Byrde:
It's pretty cool being a waitress, you know. And in the kitchen, you'll get to see all of the chef's greatest secrets!
Maya:
What secrets...?
Byrde:
You can't make it obvious, but just spy on him for a bit. You'll see. It's interesting.
Maya:
Wow! I can't wait to get my apron on now!
Phoenix:
Yeah, he has a pretty intense aroma, too.
Maya:
So did Mr. Armstrong really not see the killer...?
Byrde:
Apparently not. Well, he's in the kitchen all the time, so I guess it's possible that he didn't.

Cash register (after presenting Job Listings)







Phoenix:
It's really tight behind the cash register counter. Can Mr. Armstrong even get in there? And if he got in... could he get out again?




Trinkets (after presenting Job Listings)







Phoenix:
There's a bunch of little trinkets on a shelf by the door. I bet Mr. Armstrong collected all of these personally.




Magazine rack (after presenting Job Listings)







Phoenix:
It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French. Ugh. All the clothes in these are absolutely atrocious! ...Some of them have been circled in red. ... I really hope Mr. Armstrong is not thinking of buying those.




Table (after presenting Job Listings)







Phoenix:
Mr. Armstrong must be a pretty big neat-freak. He already has this table ready to go. Now if only the food in this place was edible...

It looks pretty cold out there on the streets. Peaceful, though. It's nice that people can take it easy after the holiday rush.

Fruit attractions







Phoenix:
You don't see many parks like this anymore. What a great place for kids to play. But that old man's the only one here, chucking his seeds at the pigeons.




Pigeons







Phoenix:
The pigeons are so busy pecking at the seeds, they don't notice anything else. Seeing those birds eat with such intense focus... ...reminds me of Maya when she's scarfing down a burger.

This is where I found that job listings magazine before. A guy like me carrying around a magazine like that kind of gives the wrong impression. I guess I better give it back to that old man once this investigation's over.Talk

Detective on left







Phoenix:
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
Detective:
"Hitting the gas is like hitting the fast-forward button on your life." No. That's too obscure. You don't really get the "you'll die before your time" idea. I need something more direct. Something a bit more light-hearted. Something like, "Hitting the gas is your passport to paradise!"
Phoenix:

Chief

This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen.

Maggey Byrde







Phoenix:
So the guilty party was Maggey Byrde, huh?
Gumshoe:
Yeah...
Phoenix:
Back when she was on the police force... ...you were her mentor when she was a rookie, right?
Gumshoe:
Yeah, I kept a close eye on her. I-I mean, not too close. You know.

Gumshoe:
...... ......... Hey, what's with the funny looks, pal? I was with her... It wasn't anything like... Look! Sure, I was her boss when she was doing her training. But that was it. Nothing happened.

Phoenix:
S-Sure... And would you mind not guessing what I'm thinking all the time?
Gumshoe:
Hey, tell your face, pal, not me. You'd have to be blind not to see what's on your mind.




The victim







Phoenix:
So I was wondering... Could you fill me in on the victim?
Gumshoe:
Glen Elg, he was a computer programmer.
Phoenix:
I see. A programmer...
Gumshoe:
He was just a regular Joe working for a small-time computer firm. Maggey never had any contact with the guy before that day. ...And all she did was take him his coffee on the day of the murder, pal.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, Maggey also claimed to have never seen the guy before...) Did the victim go to the restaurant often?
Gumshoe:
Not according to the chef. Said it was the first time he'd seen the guy.
Phoenix:
(A programmer... and a first-time customer at that...) (Changed from [A programmer... and a first-time customer...] in the original release) What possible reason could Maggey have had to kill a guy like that?
Gumshoe:
That's what I thought. But a motive was still somehow established in her trial.
Phoenix:
You're kidding! What was her supposed "motive"?
Gumshoe:
Sorry, pal. I'm real busy. I haven't even got enough time to sift through these papers. Look into it yourself, OK?
Phoenix:
(What could this motive have been...?)




The investigation







Gumshoe:
This isn't really a proper investigation. I'm kind of working on it by myself.
Phoenix:
O-Oh, that's right...
Gumshoe:
The judge already ruled on the case, and all the evidence is in already. The only problem is with Maggey's testimony.
Phoenix:
Yeah... Doesn't sound very good for us, huh?
Gumshoe:
Look, pal. I've got a mountain of papers on this case to look over before tomorrow. So I'm just gonna say this... Maggey Byrde's no liar. She's... She's... OK, so she's a bit out there, and a bit off base sometimes. But she was a good cop.
Phoenix:
(That's not exactly complimentary, you know!) So what do you think really happened? And just how contradictory is her testimony?




Contradictions (appears after "The investigation")







Gumshoe:
The biggest problem with Maggey's testimony is the number of people at the table.
Phoenix:
Yeah. My thoughts exactly. Maggey still insists there was another guy sitting with the victim.
Gumshoe:
Right. But get this... Everyone else in the place says the guy was alone. Even the chef. And then there's that CD...
Phoenix:
(CD? Oh, yeah. She did mention something about a CD...)


Byrde:
And there was a sample CD on the table, sir.


Gumshoe:
But our guys turned that place upside down. There was no CD.
Phoenix:
What?
Gumshoe:
Not on the table. Not anywhere in the whole restaurant, pal.
Phoenix:
But didn't Maggey say the victim was wearing an earpiece, too?
Gumshoe:
Yeah, but that was for the portable radio in the front pocket of his hoodie.
Phoenix:
A radio? He didn't have a CD player?
Gumshoe:
You got it. Your phony never explained that contradiction at all.
Phoenix:
(Come to think of it... The owner of Trés Bien didn't mention that CD either. I don't know why, but I get the feeling Mr. Armstrong's got something to hide...)




The charming chef (appears after presenting Jean Armstrong profile)







Phoenix:
So what exactly is it that caught your attention about the chef at Trés Bien?
Gumshoe:
It's, um... kind of hard to say... The guy's probably not even connected with the case anyway...
Phoenix:
Hey, come on, Detective. Didn't you say you'd give me the dirt on anything?
Gumshoe:
Well, this sort of stuff is kinda... unimportant, gossipy stuff, you know pal? Look, how about this? You go to Trés Bien and investigate the place yourself. And if you find out anything suspicious about the guy... you report back to me, OK?
Phoenix:
Um... Don't suppose I get a choice in this, huh? (Guess I better find out more about the chef and Trés Bien; then report back to Gumshoe.)Present









Attorney's Badge







Gumshoe:
Is that thing real, pal?
Phoenix:
Why does everybody keep asking me that?
Gumshoe:
I wonder what this phony of yours is like...
Phoenix:
He had Maggey found guilty of murder. Doesn't that tell you? (I've got to track this creep down!)




Magazine Clipping







Gumshoe:
I wasn't at the trial myself. But I asked this one detective I know how your defense was.
Phoenix:
And what did he say?
Gumshoe:
He started off by saying, "I'm at a complete loss for words..." But he must have found some quick because he went on about how bad you were for an hour.
Phoenix:
But...
Gumshoe:
He said you sucked so much, it seemed like you were trying to get Maggey found guilty!
Phoenix:
(It looked like I was "trying to get Maggey found guilty"...?)




Sports Paper







Gumshoe:
What's that? A sports paper?
Phoenix:
Yeah. I found it in the magazine rack at Trés Bien.
Gumshoe:
It's dated the same day as the murder. You may be onto something here.
Phoenix:
And take a look at this. See this writing here?
Gumshoe:
"MC Bomber"... Hey!
Phoenix:
What is it?
Gumshoe:
I've heard that name somewhere before. Yeah, "MC Bomber"...
Phoenix:
(Wow, he actually seems to be thinking for once!)
Gumshoe:
Ack, it's no good. I can't remember...
Phoenix:
(...And he goes back to being the Gumshoe we all know and love.)
Gumshoe:
Hey, pal. I'm gonna borrow this paper for a bit, OK? I wanna get a handwriting analysis done on this scribble.
Phoenix:

Gumshoe:
Thanks, pal! I bet this'll turn out to be interesting clue!

Phoenix:
(Why's that guy so determined to see me fail?)
Gumshoe:
You sure attract a lot of attention, huh? Too bad it's all the wrong kind.




Dick Gumshoe profile







Gumshoe:
I'm such a loser. I had high hopes for Maggey. I was gonna make her the best detective there ever was. But then all the sudden she was charged with murder and arrested. I never saw it coming. I never imagined they'd find her guilty. I hate myself for not being able to do anything.
Phoenix:
It's OK, Detective Gumshoe. We still have a chance to make this right.
Gumshoe:

Maggey Byrde profile







Phoenix:
Have you gone to see Maggey?
Gumshoe:
Of course I have! But I... I wasn't much good at consoling her. I'm... I'm not very good with words.
Phoenix:
Oh...
Gumshoe:
Yeah. I guess I must've looked a bit down. Maggey was really supportive of me. It was great to have someone to talk to.
Phoenix:

Jean Armstrong profile







Gumshoe:
The chef of Trés Bien, huh? You know what that chef said to me? "Oh là là! Your body is full of la toxins." And then he gave me this bottle.

I don't know. The label says, "Juniper". I'm under orders to put a few drops of it in my bath every day.
Phoenix:
Under orders?
Old Man:
Yeah. You know, there's something about the lady... I mean, guy.
Phoenix:
Huh!? You can't stop thinking about him!?

Hmm, now what was it that Maggey said again? "In the kitchen, you'll get to see all of the chef's greatest secrets!"
Maya:
In the kitchen? Mmm. That sounds tasty!
Phoenix:
Hey, wait up! Maya!
Maya:
What is it? I'm pretty busy right now.
Phoenix:
Weren't you going to show me around?

Tsk. There goes my plan to find some cool clue and show it off in your face...

Mr. Armstrong will be back soon, so we'd better search quickly! Chop, chop!Examine









Mirror







Maya:
Now THIS is one large mirror! I bet this is where he makes himself look pretty.
Phoenix:
There's a book on the dresser. "Claurice Armstrong's Bedtime Literature".
Maya:
Not exactly Pulitzer Prize material, is it?
Phoenix:
It looks like a collection of poems he's written.
Maya:
Poems? Cool! Read one out! And say it in your best French accent... with intensity! OK?
Phoenix:
OK, um... Here's one. Ahem! It's called, "Printemps". "Zee two of zem, like actors from a film. Zee coffee still undrunk. Sweet nothings over too soon, on zat sad Sunday morning. Zee foolish cocktail so delicious. Take zee last sip of your tea and I know what I will do. I must lie to you. I must."
Maya:
Huh? That's it!?
Phoenix:
Yup. That's a poem for you.




Oil bottles







Phoenix:
What's this? It looks like a treasure chest or something.
Maya:
Wow! Look at all these little bottles!
Phoenix:
Oh! They're aromatherapy oils! He's got so many, they're overflowing onto the floor...
Maya:
Let's see... 1, 2, 3... ...98, 99, 100! They're all the same, too. Hey, wait a minute...
Phoenix:
What is it?
Maya:
There's one bottle that's different from all the others.
Phoenix:
Well what do you know. And it doesn't have a label either.
Maya:
And... *sniff* It doesn't smell.
Phoenix:
(So what's that liquid inside then, I wonder?)
Maya:
Hey, Nick, we should borrow this. I mean, look how many bottles he's got. He won't miss one, will he?
Small Bottle added to the Court Record.

Lace curtains







Phoenix:
What are these lace curtains for?
Maya:
I don't know. But they give the place a real homey feel, don't they? Hmm... Lace curtains... You know, if I was a cooking pot, I'd be perfectly happy to sit on a shelf under those.
Phoenix:
(How do you respond to something like that!?)




Table







Maya:
Now I know for sure I'm in a French restaurant. I've never heard of most of these seasonings. Hey, Nick! This container has... oyster sauce? What's that?
Phoenix:
(Isn't that used in Chinese food...?) Ack! Look! Right there on the counter!
Maya:
My Magatama! What's it doing there!?
Phoenix:

Maya:
A cheesecake? You don't exactly need a sharp knife for one of those, Nick.




Stove







Maya:
Mmm. That smells good. Something's bubbling away nicely in that pot. It must be the lobster and abalone fricassée with balsamic vinaigrette.
Phoenix:
Isn't that what I just ate for lunch?

The lab got back to me about that newspaper you gave me.Phoenix:

They said the doodle was written by the victim, Glen Elg. No doubt about it.Phoenix:

The victim took the paper with him to the restaurant on the day of the murder. That's our best interpretation of the facts at the moment.Sports Paper refiled into the Court Record.Gumshoe:

Armstrong's secret (appears after presenting Small Bottle)







Phoenix:
So what's Mr. Armstrong's secret?
Gumshoe:
You ever had lunch at Trés Bien, pal?
Phoenix:
Um... Yes...
Gumshoe:
So, how was it?
Phoenix:
To put it nicely... it was inedible.
Gumshoe:
Hey, don't worry about being nice around me, pal. You and I both know the reason that place is so empty is because of the food. I mean, the place is clean, and he's got a girl like Maggey as a waitress, so...
Phoenix:
Yeah... I guess it's probably the food.
Gumshoe:
The real scoop on the guy is he's up to his ears in debt.
Phoenix:
Really? How much does he owe?
Gumshoe:
This is a copy of his loan contract. He's about half a million in the red.
Phoenix:
H-Half a million? Are we talking dollars?
Gumshoe:
Yeah. Hey, if it was Sterling, he'd really be in trouble!
Phoenix:
Sorry. That figure just took me by surprise.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, this case is full of surprises. And I'd be willing to bet that chef's got something to do with most of them. That's my hunch.
Jean's Loan Contract added to the Court Record.

Sports Paper







Gumshoe:
So according to the boys down at the lab, the doodles were probably made by the victim.
Phoenix:
Probably?
Gumshoe:
Analyzing this kind of writing is difficult since it's done with a fiber-tipped pen. But don't worry! I'll vouch for it.
Phoenix:
(Why would Gumshoe have to vouch for it? Can't it stand on its own?)




Small Bottle







Gumshoe:
You got one of those aroma bottles too, huh?
Phoenix:
Only this one doesn't smell.
Gumshoe:
Huh? I don't get you...
Phoenix:
This was mixed in with all the other aromatherapy bottles, but it's not the same. It doesn't even look the same, wouldn't you agree?
Gumshoe:
A cologne bottle that doesn't smell, huh? Smells like a skunk to me, pal! Mind letting me borrow that bottle for a while? I wanna send it to the lab for analysis.
Phoenix:
(The victim was poisoned, so the contents of this bottle are pretty important...)
Small Bottle given to Detective Gumshoe.
Gumshoe:
I had a lunch there was something funny about that chef.
Phoenix:
You suspect Jean Armstrong?
Gumshoe:
I've got that guy's number. I know what his secret is.
Phoenix:

I guess I'd better fill you in on the details. About this Armstrong guy's secret, I mean...




Jean's Loan Contract







Gumshoe:
It's for half a million dollars, pal! That's... um... half a million dollar bills!
Phoenix:
(What was the "um" in there for!?) Is there really that much money tied up in this case?
Gumshoe:
I can't give you an answer on that, pal. Not without the case file in front of me. But I'll tell you this... That Armstrong guy would've done anything for cash. He was desperate, you know?
Phoenix:
No, I don't. But I think I sort of get the picture.After examining table in Trés Bien - Kitchen:January 6Vitamin SquarePhoenix:

Maggey wouldn't just have put poison in the coffee of some guy she didn't even know. If she's really guilty, there must have been something between her and the victim.

N-Non. It was nothing. I am sure.
Phoenix:
(Somehow... I've gotta get this guy to spill the beans on everything he knows.)




Maggey's motive (after breaking Psyche-Locks)







Phoenix:
Mr. Armstrong. You said that the victim had a winning lottery ticket for half a million dollars. How did you know he had something like that in the first place?
Armstrong:
Z'e man... 'E was listening to la radio wi'z 'is earpiece.
Phoenix:
(Hmm, Maggey said something about that, too.)
Armstrong:
La winning number was announced on la news, I think. All of a sudden, 'e exploded! "Yes! 'Alf a million!" 'e shouted.
Phoenix:
And the ticket?
Armstrong:
Oui. 'E 'ad all of 'is tickets spread out on la table. I... I was so desperately in need of money, so I...
Phoenix:
Put the poison in his coffee?
Armstrong:
Non, non, non, non, non! Oh, non, you naughty man! I simply 'elped myself to one of 'is tickets.
Maya:
What?
Armstrong:
La victim collapsed, and Maggey passed out. I thought to myself, "Pourquoi pas?" 'E 'ad so many of zem.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, but only one of them was the winning ticket, right?)
Maya:
How could you do that, Mr. Armstrong!? Maggey was arrested because of you!
Armstrong:
Non! Z'is is not true!

Armstrong:
Lobster? Z'ere was no lobster in my lunch...
Maya:
Huh? But, it said, "lobster" right on the menu.
Armstrong:
Mademoiselle Maya. Please, you must read la menu more carefully. It says, "A dish inspired by lobster and abalone fricassée with a balsamic vinaigrette.
Maya:
Oh. It's only inspired, is it?
Armstrong:
Oui. Inspired by z'ese ingredients, but not per'aps made from z'em, n'est-ce pas?
Maya:
Well, guess that's the way the cookie crumbles, Nick.

Phoenix:

Armstrong:
Oui. But after la incident, z'is ticket... It disappeared!
Phoenix:

Armstrong:
Z'is was la motive z'at la prosecution gave for Maggey. Z'ey said z'at she poisoned the man to get ze 'alf a million dollar lottery ticket.
Phoenix:
Why didn't you tell me about this sooner?
Armstrong:
Mais, alors...
Phoenix:
You've been trying to hide this information about the lottery ticket from me. And I want to know the reason why!
Armstrong:
Non, monsieur! You doubt me? But I 'ave confessed to you everything I know!
Phoenix:
Mr. Armstrong. The half a million dollar lottery ticket... I think I know who took it. I think the winning ticket was stolen by this person.

And you!Phoenix:
Y-Yes?Gumshoe:
You'd better square this case away, got it pal!? Maggey's innocent, you hear!? If you screw up, then I'll be doing some squaring away myself. Squaring away some paperwork for your arrest!Phoenix:
(I-I think he's serious!)Maya:
Hey, Detective! You're on our side for once, right?Gumshoe:
Yup.Maya:
So you'll be able to help Maggey out, right?Byrde:
Really? Can you, sir!?Gumshoe:
O... Of course! I've got the simulation under control! I'm gonna be the first witness on the stand today. If something I say doesn't mesh with the facts, make sure you point it out, alright?Phoenix:
S-Sure.Gumshoe:
OK. We're forming a united front today, pal. You get me!?Byrde:
I can't tell you how grateful I am, sir! I've always admired you so much, Detective. I know I can count on you.Maya:
Looks like it should all go pretty smoothly today, huh?Phoenix:
(I can only wish...)January 7, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Maggey Byrde.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.Godot:
... Aaah, bitter!Judge:
Mr... Um... Mr. Wright.Phoenix:
Y-Yes, Your Honor?Judge:
Aaaah!Phoenix:
Wh-What's wrong!?Judge:
Nothing. It's just whenever I addressed you in the previous trial, your response was... "Youse talkin' to me!?" It was a little, well... intimidating.Phoenix:
No, no! That wasn't me. That was the phony Phoenix.Judge:
I see. So our trusty Phoenix Wright is back with us now, is he?Phoenix:
("Our trusty"...?)Judge:
So, Mr. Godot. Your opening statement, please.Godot:
Mr. Trite... Whether you're a fake or the real deal... We will find out soon enough through this trial today.Phoenix:
But I can already tell you! I'm the real Phoenix Wright!Godot:
I wasn't questioning whether you are Phoenix Wright or not. I was questioning whether you had studied law or not. That's what I intend to find out.Phoenix:
(There's no denying it. Behind that mask is a man who really hates me for some reason or another!)Judge:
As everyone is aware, the court has already given its verdict on this case once. Therefore, I won't stand for irrelevant testimony during this retrial. Nor will I stand for a simple repetition of the evidence presented in the last trial.Phoenix:
(I'm not planning on repeating anything that phony me said! Trust me!)Judge:
Now then. Mr. Godot, please summon your first witness.Godot:
Let's start with the formalities, shall we? Name and occupation?Gumshoe:
...Judge:
Witness! State your name for the court!Gumshoe:
Huh? Oh, sorry, sir! The name's Police Department Detective. Occupation, Dick Gumshoe.Godot:
Other way around, Detective.Gumshoe:
Huh? Oh! Sorry. Anyway, I'm the officer in charge of this case since yesterday. Sir!Judge:
Since yesterday?Gumshoe:
Yeah. The guy who was on the initial investigation's tied up with another case now.Maya:
I hope Gumshoe's really got everything under control... For everyone's sake.Judge:
I see. So, Detective Gumshoe... Would you outline for the court the basic facts of the case?Gumshoe:
Y-Y-Yes, sir. The victim's name was Glen Elg. He was a professional programmer. He was on the payroll of Blue Screens Inc., a local company. This is the victim's autopsy report.Judge:
The court accepts this into evidence.Glen's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.Gumshoe:
Um... And here are the floor plans of the restaurant. When the incident took place, the victim was sitting right here. The poisoned coffee was brought over to him by the, um... By the waitress.Judge:
The waitress being the accused?Gumshoe:
Yeah... The victim died from poisoning almost immediately after he took a sip of the coffee. At the time of the incident, there were two other people in the restaurant. Mr. Jean Armstrong, the owner and chef. And a regular by the name of Mr. Victor Kudo.Judge:
Hmm... It still seems to be a very straightforward case to me.Trés Bien Floor Plans added to the Court Record.Godot:
Come, Detective. Take up this hammer. And nail the defendant's coffin shut with your own two hands.Judge:
Now then, Detective Gumshoe. Let's have your testimony.Gumshoe:
Umm... Yes, sir...Witness Testimony-- The Incident --Gumshoe:
When the incident took place, the victim was alone at his table, sir.
We understand that the guy, Glen Elg, was listening to the radio at the time.
Traces of poison were found in his coffee cup.
And what we found was potassium cyanide. That stuff really packs a punch!
And, um... it looks like Ms. Byrde might've had, well... some kind of a motive.Judge:
Hmm...Godot:
Using the dark, aromatic depths of coffee to conceal the poison... Classy lady!Judge:
The facts of this case seem to be ironclad. Mr. Wright. I would ask you to begin your cross-examination, but...Phoenix:

Phoenix:
(He'd so desperate for that to be true, he's practically crying!) Your testimony just now doesn't match the testimony given by Ms. Byrde. She claims that there was another man at the victim's table.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, that's what she said. And I--
Godot:

Godot:
What killer wouldn't say that when faced with a homicide conviction?
Phoenix:
Hey!
Godot:
Sadly, her testimony isn't supported by the owner or the other customer. Isn't that right, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
Yeah, it's true. Their two testimonies tie up on that. They both said there was no other guy at the table.
Judge:
Hmm...

Godot:
I have here in my possession a ticket.
Phoenix:
A ticket? (Looks more like a photo to me.)
Godot:
Yes. A one-way ticket to guilty-ville! Population: the defendant! This is a photograph taken from near the entrance to the kitchen.
Judge:
This is the scene as witnessed by the chef, moments after the poisoning took place, correct?
Godot:
I think the court will agree that with such a clear view of the scene of the crime... ...how, Mr. Trite, could anyone have overlooked a second person at the table?
Phoenix:
Urk!

It certainly seems to show the victim's table extremely clearly.

Maya:
How much is too much?
Godot:
A lethal dose is 0.2 grams. That's about enough to finish anyone off.
Maya:
0.2 grams? How much is that?
Gumshoe:

Leads back to cross-examination




Press harder







Phoenix:
Wait a minute! The mere fact that the lottery ticket disappeared in no way implicates my client!
Godot:
Ha...! I have here in my hand... the very ticket in question!
Judge:
Th-That's the half a million dollar lottery ticket...?
Gumshoe:
One of the female police officers found it when she was conducting a search... ...of the defendant.
Phoenix:
WH-WHAAAAAT!?
Judge:
Order! Order!
Godot:
Ha...! She's quite a lucky bird, our little waitress.
Judge:
Y-You will submit that ticket as evidence to the court! Immediately!
Phoenix:
(Hmm, I'd better keep an eye on that ticket. The way the judge's voice is quivering...)
Victim's Lottery Ticket added to the Court Record.
Judge:
The ticket was presented to the court in the previous trial, too. But it feels heavier now somehow. H-Half a million dollars, you say...?
Godot:
It's just a scrap of paper. What matters is where it was found, Your Honor.
Phoenix:
(And that's on Maggey's person, unfortunately...) (Changed from [I bet he wants to say it was found on Maggey's person...] in the original release)
Leads back to cross-examinationPress (after Victim's Lottery Ticket is added to the Court Record)







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
"Some kind of a motive"?
Gumshoe:
Yeah. But if you ask me, it's been blown way out of proportion.
Godot:

Godot:
You know what my golden rule is, Detective? Chuck out a bad cup of coffee. You can always get another.
Gumshoe:
Huh? I don't get it.
Godot:
I'm saying, we can always get another witness on the stand, if we have to chuck you out.
Gumshoe:
*gulp*
Godot:
So stick to the facts, Detective. Now then, what was Ms. Byrde's motive?
Phoenix:
(Come on, Gumshoe...)
Gumshoe:
She was... They said she wanted to steal a lottery ticket.
Phoenix:
I knew it... (That's what we heard yesterday, too.)
Gumshoe:
It disappeared from the scene of the crime.
Godot:
And it wasn't just any lottery ticket. It was a winning ticket for half a million!
Maya:
Mr. Armstrong knew about the ticket too, didn't he? But he stole the wrong one...
Phoenix:
(Then is it possible Maggey stole the winning one?)Maya:
You really think there are any contradictions in this testimony?Phoenix:
To be honest, I don't know.Maya:
But Gumshoe told us out in the lobby. He said we'd be forming a united front, right? How will we win the case if he doesn't throw us a line?Phoenix:
(I don't have a whole lot of options right now... The best I can do is gather the facts together, I guess.)After selecting "Press harder" upon pressing first, third, and fifth statements:Judge:
That's enough! The facts of this case seem overwhelmingly clear to me. The defendant had ample opportunity to commit the crime of which she is charged. Furthermore, it seems beyond reasonable doubt that she did indeed commit this crime.Godot:
I like an old man who knows the score.Judge:
There is also the matter of the half a million dollar lottery ticket. That alone provides a very credible motive. I mean, for that sum of money even I might be tempted to bend the rules!Godot:
I don't mind an old man who is weak to the siren call of money.Maya:
Not good, Nick... The evidence against Maggey is starting to pile up fast.Phoenix:
Yeah, that's because the court has ruled guilty once already.Godot:
I'd say it's about time to wrap up this repeat performance... ...with one final, decisive piece of evidence.Phoenix:
(He's got more evidence against Maggey!?)Godot:
This is the apron the delightful Ms. Byrde was wearing at the time.Maya:
Wow... That's not the cleanest apron I've seen...Phoenix:
Th-That stain looks like...! (It can't be... blood, can it!?)Godot:
Ha...! It seems the star of our play was a little flustered... And somehow spilled coffee on herself.Phoenix:
The coffee!? That's not exactly the first thing that caught my eye...Godot:
Of course. The coffee stain isn't the most interesting thing about this apron. No, there's something else that stands out even more.Judge:
Something else? I presume you mean...Godot:
Of course. I'm referring to the pocket.Phoenix:
The... pocket?Godot:
A search carried out right after the incident uncovered this... Potassium cyanide. The very poison used by the killer, was in her apron pocket!Phoenix:
A bottle of poison... In Maggey's pocket?Gumshoe:
Yeah. And Maggey's prints were the only ones on it.Phoenix:
WHAAAT!?Judge:
Order! Order! Order! The court will accept these items into evidence.Apron added to the Court Record.Potassium Cyanide added to the Court Record.Judge:
There's something still bothering me, Mr. Godot. Why have you not explained the bloodstain to the court?Godot:
Bloodstain? What bloodstain would that be?Judge:
Don't play games, prosecutor! The blood-colored stain that's smeared all over the apron!Godot:
That's ridiculous! No one told me anything about a bloodstain!Phoenix:
(You don't need to be told! Just look at it!)Godot:
Well, Detective!? Could this stain really be... BLOOD!?Gumshoe:
N-No way, sir! That's... It's just ketchup. Sir.Phoenix:
Ketchup!?Gumshoe:
She must've gotten some on her an apron while taking someone their breakfast that day.Judge:
... You could have spoken up a little sooner, Detective Gumshoe!Godot:
Pull a stunt like that again, and I'll have you drink 17 cups of ketchup, witness!Gumshoe:
Unnngh... I thought everyone knew what it was already.Judge:
Hmm... I haven't seen anything yet to make me doubt the last verdict I ruled on this case.Phoenix:
...!Judge:
The motive, the opportunity, and the supporting evidence... They have all been clearly established.Godot:
Well, Trite... It seems you really are a phony after all.Phoenix:
(Argh! You really know how to drive a man nuts!)Judge:
Witness, please continue with your testimony. Describe for the court the crime scene and the findings of your investigation there.Witness Testimony-- The Investigation --Gumshoe:
The crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.
Poor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her.
The victim didn't have any identification on him.
But we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly.
When Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison.
And that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene.Judge:
Hmm... You identified the victim and secured your prime suspect... Very good.Godot:
Last chance to convince the court you're a real lawyer, Trite!Phoenix:
...!Godot:
Don't court on any more cross-examinations after this one! So, let the fun begin!Cross Examination

And someone may have been wrongly convicted as a result.\nMaya:\n...Guess you should\'ve gone into showbiz, huh, Nick?\nPhoenix:\n(...*sigh* I will never understand how your mind works, Maya.)\n\n\n\n\nMaya Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo? How\'s your spirit medium training going?\nMaya:\nWell... I stand under the rushing waters of the shower head every day.\nPhoenix:\n...That\'s called "taking a shower". What happened to the rushing waters of a waterfall?\nMaya:\nWell, I\'m kind of taking a break... I\'m having a bit of trouble right now, you know?\nPhoenix:\n(Last year\'s incident must still be on her mind... I haven\'t seen Maya train at all since that time. I think Mia said it\'s because Maya\'s at a loss these days...)\n\n\n\n\nMia Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMia helped me out in court again last time.\nMaya:\nIt\'s so cool that you get to meet my sis like that.\nPhoenix:\nYeah...\nMaya:\nWe mediums lose consciousness when we\'re channeling, so I don\'t get to see my sis...\nPhoenix:\n...I never really thought about it that way. Hey! If you want to meet Mia... ...why don\'t we just have Pearls call her?\nMaya:\nNo... I couldn\'t do that. I\'d be too worried about her.\nPhoenix:\n(I guess Maya\'s got all sorts of things to think about, too. ...Despite her immaturity saying otherwise.)\n\n\n\n\nGodot profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nSo you still can\'t remember anything about Godot, huh?\nPhoenix:\nI already told you. I have no idea who he is, let alone why he dislikes me so much.\nMaya:\nWell he sure seems to have a problem with you for some reason. You\'d better watch your back, Nick. Coffee lovers can be quite bitter.\nPhoenix:\nYou\'re just making that up, Maya!\n\n\n\n\nDick Gumshoe profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nDigging up an old case that\'s already been ruled on... That\'s not like Gumshoe, is it?\nPhoenix:\nNo. He barely manages to stay on top of the cases in front of him.\nMaya:\nYeah, he\'s always busy, and gets dirt pay. I mean, look at that dusty old coat he wears!\nPhoenix:\n(Did you mean he "gets paid dirt" or do you really think they pay him in gravel?)\n\n\n\n\nAny other evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nDo you know anything about this, Maya?\nMaya:\nHmm... Even someone as worldly-wise as me doesn\'t know everything about everything, Nick.

My bet is on the courthouse. He\'s probably trying to arrange the retrial of this case.Maya:\nGuess that means we should go to the detention center and chat with our killer, huh?Phoenix:\nAfter being convicted without a fair trial, I\'m not sure killer is the right label...Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetective on left\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThat must be one of the detectives. He\'s mumbling something to himself.\nDetective:\n"Don\'t die running a red light. Die the old-fashioned way -- of old age!" We have a winner! Inject a bit of humor, that\'s the key.\nPhoenix:\n... He must be coming up with slogans for a safety campaign. ...I guess?\n\n\n\n\nDesks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThese are the detectives\' desks. There are computers and files on each one. Funny, they\'re a lot tidier than I expected. I guess the detectives don\'t spend a lot of time at their desks.\n\n\n\n\nPoster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nA poster of a female police officer... Wait, no. That\'s the latest "Babes in Uniform" calendar. My bad.\n\n\n\n\nChief\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThis must be the chief of the detectives here. He\'s glued to his computer screen.\nChief:\nWHAT! Mask☆DeMasque turned up at the bank? What\'s he doing!? "Hands up, you scalawags!" "You\'re under arrest!" Hey! That\'s our job!\nPhoenix:\n(Looks like Ron DeLite\'s opted for a new career.)\nDetective:\nQuit surfing the net, Chief!\nChief:\nS-Sorry...

It was my idea! I made it! And now, it\'s the national symbol of the police force!\nPhoenix:\nSo what\'s with the pink one? It\'s new, right?\nMaya:\nShe\'s not an "it", Nick. She\'s a "she", right Chief?\nChief:\nYup. Meet the "Pink Badger".\nMaya:\nSo one\'s called "Blue", and the other\'s called "Pink", but they\'re both called "Badger"?\nChief:\nYou got it! They\'re both married.\nMaya:\nUmm... Mr. & Mrs. Badger seem to be cuffed together, Chief.\nChief:\nYou got it! That\'s marriage for you!\nPhoenix:\n(Whoa... A mascot that\'s deeper than the deepest of deep oceans...)January 6Detention CenterVisitor\'s RoomMaya:\nThis is so nerve-wracking, waiting to meet our new client. I wonder just what kind of person you tricked and got found guilty...?Phoenix:\nK-Keep it down, Maya! That kind of talk could ruin me!???:\nAaaaaaaah! How could you, Mr. Wright!? How could you do this to me!? They put me in solitary! I haven\'t been able to stop crying.Phoenix:\nA-Aren\'t... you...???:\nYes, I am! I am totally and utterly let down!Maya:\nAah! You\'re... Are you...????\nDon\'t pretend you don\'t know me! It\'s me, Maggey, remember!? Maggey Byrde!Phoenix:\nMaggey Byrde... Ah! (Maggey Byrde... She\'s the policewoman I defended that one time. She was accused of murdering her lover. He was a cop, too.) What are you doing in here!? Didn\'t I get you acquitt--Byrde:\nOh, sure! Very funny! After that fifth-rate defense job, you come in here and start making jokes!?Maya:\nYou better hurry up and tell her what happened, Nick.Byrde:\nO-Oh... I see...Phoenix:\nSo that\'s where we stand right now.Maya:\nI\'m sorry you\'ve been caught up in another murder...Byrde:\nMy whole life has been nothing but a whirlwind of bad luck and failures.Phoenix:\n(I vaguely remember her saying the exact same thing last time...)Byrde:\nBut I don\'t mind! What\'s one more disaster in my life? At least now the real Mr. Wright is here with me. I won\'t let the world keep me down, sir!Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurveillance camera\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSmile, you\'re on candid camera.\n\n\n\n\nGuard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThis guard monitors the visitor\'s room.

He looks like he\'s getting a bit restless.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaggey Byrde\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nSo, how come you\'re dressed like that, Maggey? Last year you looked so sharp in that police uniform.\nByrde:\nHmph. I was fired after that... incident last year.\nMaya:\nOh. I\'m sorry.\nByrde:\nIt\'s OK. I don\'t mind one bit. I enjoyed being on the force, but I think it was time for me to move on.\nMaya:\nSo, what do you do now?\nByrde:\nIn the second act of "The Life of Maggey Byrde", I\'m playing the role of a waitress!\nMaya:\nA waitress!?\nByrde:\nYes. In a French restaurant. It\'s a small place, but it\'s quite fashionable. My charming smile and shapely figure came through for me. And the owner, Mr. Armstrong, hired me straight away, sir.\nPhoenix:\nAnd then you got into this mess straight away, right?\nByrde:\nYeah, you could put it that way...\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nByrde:\nThis whole mess started on the 3rd of last month... And it happened at Trés Bien.\nMaya:\n"Treh Bee-an"...?\nByrde:\nYes. It\'s a restaurant where good service and a friendly smile are always included!\nMaya:\nOh...\nByrde:\nThere were two men at the table, both drinking coffee. And then... One of the men slipped some poison into the victim\'s cup! The victim took just one sip and was gasping for air! I was so shocked, I passed out.\nMaya:\nHey, hold on there, Maggey.\nByrde:\nWhat?\nMaya:\nYou keep calling the guy, "the victim". Didn\'t you know the guy who was killed?\nByrde:\nNot at all! I\'d never even seen the guy before!\nMaya:\nOh...\nPhoenix:\n(So she wouldn\'t have a motive to kill him then, I guess...) And the other man, the killer. You saw him, right?\nByrde:\nOf course! A good waitress must be attentive to the clientele.\nPhoenix:\nSo, you saw the killer, but you were found guilty of the crime anyway? How come?\nByrde:\n......... You tell me, Mr. Wright!\nPhoenix:\nAck! (Guess the answer to my question is "my phony"... Anyway, she saw the killer. Better see if I can get a description of the guy.)\n\n\n\n\nGuilty verdict (appears after "What happened")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nSo, if you saw the murderer, why were you still convicted?\nByrde:\nBecause no one else saw.\nMaya:\nSaw what?\nByrde:\nThe other man. The one who put the poison in the victim\'s coffee. Everyone testified that way. Mr. Armstrong, the customer... Everyone. "The victim was sitting alone at his table the whole time."\nPhoenix:\nBut how\'s that possible?\nByrde:\nI don\'t know. But nobody, not one person, would believe me, sir. Even Phoenix Wright, my one last hope for a fair trial, failed me. What a pathetic defense! My granny could\'ve done a better job!\nPhoenix:\nLook! That wasn\'t me, OK?\nByrde:\nAnd then! ...They found something a bit incriminating in my apron pocket.\nMaya:\nWhat?\nByrde:\nA small bottle... of poison.\nMaya:\nWHAT!? P-Poison!? It was in your pocket!?\nByrde:\nWell, I passed out when the victim collapsed. The killer must\'ve slipped the poison into my pocket when I was unconscious.\nPhoenix:\nAnd no one else saw this other guy?\nByrde:\nNo, sir. That\'s what everyone said. But I don\'t see how they could\'ve missed him...\n\n\n\n\nThe other guy (appears after "Guilty verdict")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nByrde:\nI was the one who took the coffee to the two men.\nPhoenix:\nO-Oh...? And what was your impression of them?\nByrde:\nWell... When I first saw them, I kind of thought they might be in the music industry.\nMaya:\nIn music? How come?\nByrde:\nWell, one of them had some sort of earpiece, and an emo musician\'s look about him. And there was a sample CD on the table, sir.\nMaya:\nAn earpiece and a sample CD, huh? Did you get a look at the CD at all?\nByrde:\nIt had a band\'s name written on it. I think it was "MC"-something. They must\'ve been preparing for their debut, I guess.\nPhoenix:\nSo it was a band\'s CD. Maybe a promo disc?\nMaya:\nMaybe it was "MC Screwdriver"!\nPhoenix:\nGet serious, Maya. Would you buy the CD of a group named that?\nByrde:\nNngh... What was the name of that group again...? "MC Hacksaw..."? No... "MC..."\nMaya:\nAnd what about the killer? What did he look like?\nByrde:\nWell, I, um... I don\'t really remember. Only that he was a young man. Well-built like the victim, really.Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney\'s Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nByrde:\nThat badge! Is it real?\nPhoenix:\nOf course it\'s real!\nByrde:\nThat\'s what they all say. But I\'ve been duped before. Give it to me for a sec!\nPhoenix:\nAh...!\n...*chomp!*\nMaya:\nShe... She bit into it...\nByrde:\nAnd I left a few teeth marks, too!\nPhoenix:\nI can see that...\nByrde:\nI just wish I could remember if that means it\'s real or a fake.\nPhoenix:\n*sigh* (I said it was real!)\n\n\n\n\nMagazine Clipping\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOh, yeah. I need to ask you about this...\nByrde:\nHey! This article\'s about my case!\nPhoenix:\nCan you tell me anything about the guy who was pretending to be me?\nByrde:\nYes, sir! It was the morning after I\'d been arrested... I met you in the visitor\'s room here. You were wearing one of your super-sharp suits.\nPhoenix:\nMe?\nByrde:\nYes, you, Mr. Wright.\nPhoenix:\nArgh...\nMaya:\nHey, Maggey! Was my evil double Ayam here, too?\nByrde:\nNo. I don\'t remember a phony you, Maya.\nMaya:\nOh... *sigh* It would\'ve been so cool...\nByrde:\nThen you got really worked up and passionate. "I\'m gonna get you\' cleared\'a dis crime!" you said. (Changed from [\'I\'m gonna get you cleared of this crime!\' you said.] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\nOK, I get the picture. But you\'ve met me in person before... So how come you didn\'t realize that guy wasn\'t the real me?\nByrde:\n... I guess, looking back now, it was a little strange...\nPhoenix:\nOnly a little?\nByrde:\nWell, OK, so you were a bit taller than normal. And you looked a bit shady. And your voice was a bit weird. Oh, and you had this funny accent. And...\nPhoenix:\nSo the guy was nothing like me, then!?\nByrde:\nBut he had your spiky hair and blue suit.\nPhoenix:\n(... Is that all it takes for someone to imitate me...?)\nMaya:\nHow about everyone else in the courtroom, like the judge and the observers...? Didn\'t they realize he was an imposter?\nByrde:\nEveryone had these big question marks on their faces... But it seemed that no one wanted to say anything, sir.\nMaya:\nThis case just keeps getting weirder and weirder...\n\n\n\n\nMaya Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nByrde:\nThanks for your help last year!\nMaya:\nAw, it was nothing. I\'m glad we got you off the hook.\nByrde:\nI hope you can help me out this year, too!\nMaya:\nYeah, me too. It\'s be sweet if we could get that verdict overturned.\n\n\n\n\nDick Gumshoe profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nByrde:\nOh, Detective Gumshoe! He really looked out for me when I was on the force!\nPhoenix:\nHave you seen him recently?\nByrde:\nNo. He\'s never been to the restaurant.\nMaya:\nGuess he\'s not a fan of French cuisine, huh? He\'s an instant noodle type of guy, after all.\nByrde:\nYeah, he prefers the simple things in life.\nPhoenix:\n(...Or he\'s just simply too poor to afford anything else.)\n\n\n\n\nMaggey Byrde profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nByrde:\nNo matter what happens, I never let anything get me down!\nMaya:\nYou\'re always so positive, aren\'t you, Maggey?\nByrde:\nMacho Maggey Byrde, they say! The early Byrde catches the worm! A Byrde in the hand!\nMaya:\nWow! All those phrases are named after you?\nByrde:\nAnd I never turn my back on anything!\nMaya:\nYou\'re always so strong, aren\'t you, Maggey?\nByrde:\nMacho Maggey Byrde, they say! I\'m a tough old Byrde!\nMaya:\n"Tough old byrde", Nick! Hee hee! Do you get it?\nPhoenix:\n...Yeah, I get it.\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nByrde:\nI know I used to be on the police force, sir. But I\'m incarcerated, now. So I can\'t use my connections to help you. All I can tell you about now is info about ex-cons or the clientele of Trés Bien, sir...\nMaya:\nAww, don\'t let it get you down, Maggey!After clearing all Talk options and presenting Magazine Clipping:Byrde:\nMr. Wright... Do you think it\'s possible to get a retrial?Phoenix:\nProbably. The court ruled in the absence of a genuine defense attorney. So we should be able to get a retrial.Byrde:\nUm... Mr. Wright...?Phoenix:\n?Byrde:\nDo you think we\'ll win next time? ...Sir?Phoenix:\n...!Byrde:\nMy life has been a full course meal of bad luck, complete with defeat for dessert. Since I was 6 months old, when I fell from the 9th floor of my apartment building... ...I\'ve been hit by all sorts of vehicles, gotten sick from all sorts of foods... ...failed at almost every test I\'ve taken, experienced almost every kind of disaster... I even landed a phony lawyer when I had the misfortune of being accused of murder. But! I will survive! Because Maggey Byrde always lives to fight another day! And one day, I\'ll find it! Just you wait and see, sir! I\'ll find that one, single moment of good luck!Maya:\nArgh, Xin Eohp is really gonna pay for this!Phoenix:\nWh-What are you staring at me like that for...? (But Maya\'s right... Whoever it is that thought it was a good idea to use my name... ...and get an innocent girl convicted of murder had better watch out!)Maya:\nWe\'ll find him! Don\'t you worry. We\'ll get Xin Eohp for you!Byrde:\nThank you! Oh! I\'ll tell you where Trés Bien is then!Phoenix:\nTrés... Ah, right. The restaurant where the murder took place.Byrde:\nYes, sir. When you go, please tell Mr. Armstrong I said hi!Maya:\nSure! Alright, Nick! Let\'s go check out this restaurant and its food!January 6Trés BienMaya:\nWow! Look at this place.Phoenix:\n"Look"? More like "smell"... What is with the suffocating scent of flowers in here...? Then again, girls like that sort of thing, right?Maya:\nActually, I\'m not all that into it...Phoenix:\n...Maya:\n... No one\'s coming to seat us. Maybe there\'s no one here.Phoenix:\nDon\'t be silly, Maya. This is a restaurant, and it\'s open for business. HELLO! ANYONE HERE? ... I don\'t believe it! There really isn\'t anyone here!Maya:\nPerfect! Let\'s get intrusive! If there\'s no one here, we can take anything we want!Phoenix:\n(Yeah, I suppose we can...)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash register\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nLook, it\'s one of those magical boxes that spits out money.\nPhoenix:\nYou know, you\'re the only person who would ever describe a cash register in that way!\n\n\n\n\nTrinkets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nLook at all the little trinkets tucked away in here.\nPhoenix:\nI bet Mr. Armstrong collected all of these personally. Let\'s see... A bouquet of flowers, some potpourri, and look! Fine bone china cups!\nMaya:\n... I never knew you were so... cultured.\nPhoenix:\nCome on, Maya! This is common knowledge! Any Joe Schmoe knows this much!\n\n\n\n\nFront entrance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt\'s the restaurant\'s front entrance. There\'s a sign hanging on the door written in French. It probably says, "Open" or "Closed". It must be one or the other, but I don\'t know which since I dunno Jacques about French.\n\n\n\n\nMagazine rack\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nIt\'s a rack full of fashion magazines. And they\'re all in French.\nPhoenix:\nWhy don\'t you try wearing something a bit more "chic" something, huh, Maya?\nMaya:\nYeah. I guess I could. I\'m always in my acolyte clothes, aren\'t I? It\'d be fun to wear normal clothes every now and then.\nPhoenix:\nHm? There\'s something stuffed in behind the rack.\nMaya:\n...Looks like a sports paper to me. Hey, and look at this! Someone\'s scribbled a little doodle on one of the pages. "MC Bomber", and one, two, three, four, five zeros... A-A hundred thousand... dollars... maybe?\nPhoenix:\nI wonder what "MC Bomber" is supposed to be...?\xa0! (This paper! It\'s from December 3rd...) This paper\'s from the day of the poisoning!\nMaya:\nWHAT!?\nSports Paper added to the Court Record.\nPhoenix:\n(A paper from the day of the murder... This has got to be a clue! I should see if I can find out some more about this paper...)\n\n\n\n\nMagazine rack (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nIt\'s a rack full of fashion magazines. And they\'re all in French.\nPhoenix:\nLooks like Mr. Armstrong doesn\'t get any newspapers.\nMaya:\nWell, it wouldn\'t exactly suit the feel of the place, would it?\nPhoenix:\nWhy don\'t you try wearing something a bit more "chic" like in these mags, Maya?\nMaya:\nYeah. I\'d look stunning in some of those Parisian frocks, huh?\nPhoenix:\n(We found that sports paper behind this magazine rack earlier... I\'d better try to find out everything I can about it...)\n\n\n\n\nTable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThis table\'s set nicely. It just needs a customer.\nMaya:\nWhat do you think this flower is, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nLet\'s see... Well, it doesn\'t look like a tulip, and it\'s not a sunflower, I don\'t think...\nMaya:\nDuh. Even I could\'ve told you that.\nPhoenix:\nWell, those are the only kinds of flowers I know. Dagnabit, I\'m a lawyer, not a botanist!\n\n\n\n\nWindows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWow! It\'s a beautiful winter wonderland out there.\nMaya:\nReally!? Cool! I love snow! Let me see! Huh? It\'s not white. It\'s not even snowing.\nPhoenix:\nGot you! I was only kidding, Maya.\nMaya:\nNick! There are lies that are OK to tell, and lies that definitely aren\'t.\nPhoenix:\n(...All I did was tell an itty-bitty white lie about nonexistent white snow.)\n\n\n\n\nPartition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThis restaurant has partitions that separate the tables. When you\'re seated at a table, you can only see the tables to your right or left.\n\n\n\n\nCrime scene\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThis must be the table where the murder occurred.\nMaya:\nI guess so, with all this police tape all around it.\nPhoenix:\nAnd that stain must be from the poisoned coffee. Don\'t go licking the tablecloth, OK, Maya?\nMaya:\nWhy would I lick it? I\'m not a cat, you know!\nPhoenix:\n(Then why can I picture you doing just that?)Wright & Co. Law OfficesPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSports Paper\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nHmm... "MC Bomber"...\nPhoenix:\nAnd don\'t forget the "100,000", too.\nMaya:\nThere\'s something about that name, "MC Bomber".\nPhoenix:\nYeah, It\'s a pretty unusual name.\nPhoenix:\nAnd don\'t forget the "100,000", too.\nMaya:\nEveryone\'s worried about bombs these days, I guess.\nPhoenix:\nI\'m not sure that has any bearing on anything related to this case...)\nMaya:\nAnyway, we should really look into this some more!\n\n\n\n\nMaggey Byrde profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nThis is Maggey\'s second time as a murder suspect, huh?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. The first time was a little over a year ago... She was on the police force back then.\nMaya:\nWasn\'t she working under Gumshoe? That does it, Nick! We\'re gonna get her off the hook or I\'ll give up hamburgers!Detention CenterPresent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSports Paper\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nByrde:\nOh! A sports paper. Let\'s see, let\'s see... Did Gutsen Brawn manage to defend his heavyweight title?\nPhoenix:\nSorry, Maggey. That paper is actually a month old... It\'s from the day of the murder...\nMaya:\nAnd Gutsen got knocked out yesterday, I\'m afraid.\nByrde:\nOh, no...\nPhoenix:\nI found this paper in the magazine rack at Trés Bien.\nByrde:\nReally? That\'s strange... Trés Bien doesn\'t get newspapers. Mr. Armstrong says he\'s not really fond of them.\nMaya:\nThen maybe one of the customers left it behind?\nPhoenix:\nAnyway, what I want you to take a look at is this scribble here.\nByrde:\nAh-ha! That\'s it, sir! "MC Bomber"! That was the name that was written on the CD!\nPhoenix:\n(Just as I thought...)\nMaya:\nI guess it wasn\'t "MC Screwdriver" after all, huh...\nByrde:\nSo, that $100,000 must be a down payment for a record deal, right?\nMaya:\nIf someone gave me $100,000, I\'d sing for sure! "The Master of Kurain" or "The Spirit Song" or even "Maya\'s Theme"!\nPhoenix:\nUm, OK, Maya... So, if the sample CD was on the victim\'s table... That means this newspaper may have belonged to the victim!\nMaya:\nYou\'re right!\nPhoenix:\n(So the victim left this behind on the day of the murder, huh...)\nMaya:\nI think we better step up the investigation, don\'t you Nick?After presenting Sports Paper in Detention Center - Visitor\'s Room:January 6Trés Bien???:\nOh là là!

"Trés Bien" is Français! In English, you would say, "Very Good".\nMaya:\nOh. Very good...\nArmstrong:\nOui, exactement! La atmosphere is trés bien, and la cuisine is trés bien!\nPhoenix:\n(If the food\'s good, why aren\'t there any customers in here?)\nArmstrong:\nMy cuisine is not for all. Some people, z\'ey do not appreciate la haute cuisine.\nPhoenix:\n(I thought everyone liked hot cuisine...)\nArmstrong:\nSince I \'ave lost Maggey, I do not \'ave enough \'ands.\nPhoenix:\nSo, you\'re running this place on your own now?\nArmstrong:\nOui. For la moment. No one \'as answered my advertisement. Oh, poor moi!\nPhoenix:\n(... Please don\'t eyeball me while you say that.)\nArmstrong:\nI am la chef. I am la manager. I am also a trained aromatherapist.\nMaya:\nA roaming what?\nArmstrong:\nA practitioner d\'aromatherapy. La art of soothing la soul wiz z\'e delicate floral aromas.\nPhoenix:\n(Delicate? The smell coming from that bottle earlier was anything but...)\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, could you tell me what you know about the incident?\nArmstrong:\nBien. It makes me sad to remember it, yet I remember it so well. More z\'an a month \'as passed since it \'appened.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, I guess it\'s been about a month since Maggey\'s sentencing...)\nArmstrong:\nSo. It was z\'e third of last month. Just after one in z\'e afternoon. A man who was in \'ere for a coffee suddenly became ill.\nPhoenix:\nBecause of the poison in his coffee?\nArmstrong:\nZ\'at is la truth as I know it. It was Maggey who took \'is drink to \'im. I was in la kitchen. I \'eard z\'e sound of someone collapsing. When I came out to see what it was, \'e was already slumped in \'is chair.\nMaya:\nHe was dead?\nArmstrong:\nMon dieu! Oui! \'E was dead! Maggey \'ad passed out also.\nPhoenix:\nAnd this man who died... Was he alone?\nArmstrong:\nOui, monsieur. All alone. I know z\'at Maggey said z\'ere was someone else, but...\nMaya:\nI see...\nArmstrong:\nLa police, z\'ey asked me many times. "Are you sure z\'ere was no one else at z\'e table?" z\'ey asked. But I am not z\'e only one. La old man said z\'e same thing.\nPhoenix:\nOld man? What old man?\n\n\n\n\nOld man (appears after "What happened")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... So who is the old man that you mentioned?\nArmstrong:\nAt z\'e time of la murder, z\'ere was another customer in \'ere.\nMaya:\nWhat!? Someone else saw it?\nArmstrong:\nMais, oui! As usual, \'e came alone z\'at day. At z\'e time of la murder, \'e was \'ere. \'E saw it, too. But \'e said z\'e same thing, z\'at z\'ere was no one else at la victim\'s table.\nMaya:\nBut Maggey swears there were two people!\nArmstrong:\nMais, mademoiselle. La lawyer, \'e could not prove z\'is, non?\nPhoenix:\nAbout the lawyer. That was me, I suppose?\nArmstrong:\nMais bien sûr!\nPhoenix:\n... Wow! He\'s the first person who\'s said it wasn\'t me.\nMaya:\nDon\'t kid yourself, Nick! Hmph. Now who\'s the one making stuff up!?\n\n\n\n\nMaggey\'s motive (appears after presenting Maggey Byrde profile)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhen Maggey took the coffee over to the victim... ...did anything happen?\nArmstrong:\nOu... Oui. I-I suppose you could say so.\nPhoenix:\nSo what happened?\nArmstrong:\nNon. It was, er... It was nothing.\nMaya:\nLook, Maggey says she didn\'t even know the guy! But she\'s still been indicted for murder! The prosecution must have come up with some kind of motive!\nArmstrong:\nOui. It is true.\nPhoenix:\nIf there was anything at all between Maggey and the victim, it could be relevant.\nMaya:\nSo please! Tell us anything you know.\n\n3 PSYCHE-LOCKS\n\nPhoenix:\n(Psyche-Locks!?) (Changed from [A Psyche-Lock!?] in the original release)\nMaya:\nNo way! What are we going to do, Nick?\nPhoenix:\nWe\'ll just have to remov... WHAT THE!?\nMaya:\nWh-What\'s wrong?\nPhoenix:\nThe Magatama... It\'s gone!\nMaya:\nHuh?\nPhoenix:\nI had it in my pocket, but... It has vanished into thin air!\nMaya:\nWHAT!?\nPhoenix:\n(But I could see the Psyche-Locks. (Changed from [But I could see the Psyche-Lock.] in the original release) Maybe that means the Magatama\'s nearby...?)\n\n\n\n\nMaggey\'s motive (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMaggey wouldn\'t just have put poison in the coffee of some guy she didn\'t even know. If she\'s really guilty, there must have been something between her and the victim.\n\n3 PSYCHE LOCKS\n\nArmstrong:\nN-Non. It was nothing. I am sure. Qué será, será. Perhaps Maggey \'ad another reason.\nPhoenix:\n(What\'s Maggey\'s motive got to do with this chef? Why is he hiding things from me? And another thing... Where did I drop the Magatama? The fact that I can see the lock [sic] must mean it\'s nearby.)\nMaya:\nI only loaned it to you, you know. So you better find it, Nick! OK?\nPhoenix:\n(...And here I thought it was mine to keep!)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney\'s Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArmstrong:\nPlease, monsieur. Z\'ere is no need to show me z\'at. You are Mon. Phoenix Wright, z\'e worst defense lawyer in town.\nPhoenix:\n(I think I can imagine how he formed this completely wrong impression of me...) Um, the last time we met, did I show you this badge?\nArmstrong:\nOui. You flashed it to everyone in la restaurant!\nMaya:\nLooks like Xin Eohp is a bigger fan of flashing stuff than you are, Nick!\n\n\n\n\nMagazine Clipping\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArmstrong:\nI am not a lawyer myself. I do not wish to speak out of turn. But your defense in court z\'at day was a little, how you say, "lacking", per\'aps?\nPhoenix:\n*sigh*\nArmstrong:\nEven a Frenchman who cannot speak any English could \'ave done a better job! You were very cool, though. Oh, oui, oui! So \'andsome.\nMaya:\nWow, I wonder just how bad the defense could\'ve been...\nArmstrong:\nEvery time you opened your mouth, z\'e \'ole courthouse stirred.\nPhoenix:\n(Oh, man. That is something I don\'t want to imagine...)\n\n\n\n\nSports Paper\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWe found this sports paper in the magazine rack here.\nArmstrong:\nOne of my customers must \'ave left it behind.\nMaya:\nDo you have any idea which customer it was?\nArmstrong:\nZ\'e only ideas I \'ave, mademoiselle, I save for my kitchen!\n\n\n\n\nMaya Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArmstrong:\nOh là, là! You \'ave such a pretty smile, my petite chulip!\nMaya:\nWho, me?\nArmstrong:\nOui. La smile is the most important thing for us girls, n\'est-ce pas?\nMaya:\nUm... Sure!\nArmstrong:\nIf you want a job \'ere, it is yours, precious!\n\n\n\n\nMia Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArmstrong:\nMon dieu! What beauty!\nMaya:\nThat\'s my sister!\nArmstrong:\nAh, oui? Another delight! But you \'ave a certain je ne sais quois z\'at I do not sense from your sister.\nMaya:\nI do?\nArmstrong:\nSo throw your head \'ead \'igh! Thrust out your feminine features! Do not lose \'eart, ma fille! You are a woman! A woman extraordinaire!\nMaya:\nDo I look like I need cheering up or something?\n\n\n\n\nMaggey Byrde profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArmstrong:\nMaggey was a policewoman once, n\'est-ce pas?\nPhoenix:\nYes. But she had to quit for, um, reasons beyond her control.\nArmstrong:\nOui, oui. She was la suspect in la murder investigation, non?\nMaya:\nOh... You know about that?\nArmstrong:\nZ\'at is why I gave to \'er la perfume for la \'appiness.\nPhoenix:\nHappiness perfume?\nArmstrong:\nOui. Blended from bergamot, like I \'ave given to you before.\nPhoenix:\nBut she\'s been arrested again. And found guilty this time.\nArmstrong:\nZ\'is is true. \'Er natural aroma of un\'appiness must \'ave been very strong.\nPhoenix:\n(Just admit it! Your perfume doesn\'t work!)\nArmstrong:\nI am not surprised she was la prime suspect. After something like z\'at took place before my very eyes.\nMaya:\nSomething like what?\nPhoenix:\n(What\'s this guy talking about!?)\nMaya:\nDoes this mean... Maggey did have a motive?\nPhoenix:\nWe\'ve got to ask this guy for more info, stat!\n\n\n\n\nJean Armstrong profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArmstrong:\nIt is \'ard to imagine, I know, but I was an apprentice for five years in la gay Paris.\nMaya:\nWow! In Paris!?\nArmstrong:\nIt was something la chef z\'ere said to me z\'at made me decide to open my own restaurant.\nPhoenix:\nWhat was it?\nArmstrong:\nZ\'at awful man said to me, "You must train for another ten years!" Oh! It was such a shock! So unexpected! But you would \'ave to be a fool to do z\'is, non?\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm, about this...\nArmstrong:\nFélicitations! Mais... qu\'est-ce que c\'est?\nPhoenix:\nAck! Um... Je... Je no comprehend...\nMaya:\nNick! Don\'t just make something up!After clearing all Talk options:Phoenix:\nUm, Mr. Armstrong... Could I just confirm something with you again? The table where the victim was sitting... Was anyone else sitting there?Armstrong:\n... Z\'at is a question you will \'ave to ask \'im yourselves.Maya:\nHuh? "\'Im"?Armstrong:\nLa old man spends all of \'is time dans la parc.Phoenix:\nLa p-parc? Oh, a park? What park\'s that?Armstrong:\nBehind la restaurant. It is called, "Vitamin Square".Maya:\nThank you!Armstrong:\nJe vous en prie, my dear!Maya:\nLet\'s go check out this Vitamin Square right now, Nick!January 6Vitamin SquareMaya:\nSo this is Vitamin Square.Phoenix:\nYeah. I see where they get the name from now. The fruits scream "VITAMINS!" at you.Maya:\nHey, Nick! That\'s the guy, right? Isn\'t that the old man Mr. Armstrong was talking about?Phoenix:\nThat grouchy-looking grandpa?Maya:\nHe\'s throwing seeds out for the pigeons.Phoenix:\nMaya, he\'s not throwing seeds for them, he\'s throwing seeds AT them!Old Man:\n...Phoenix:\n(Ugh... My grumpiness-threat level has just been raised to red...)Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSandbox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nI used to love sandboxes like you wouldn\'t believe!\nPhoenix:\nReally? You?\nMaya:\nSure. Finding iron filings in the sand with a magnet was my favorite thing to do.\nPhoenix:\nIron filings? Wow... That\'s too exciting for words.\nMaya:\nIt was my ambition to collect every single shred of iron in the sandbox. I was such a kid back then!\nPhoenix:\nSo, did you manage to get all the iron?\nMaya:\nNo, I never did. I think I came close, though. Come to think of it, I still have all the iron filings I found way back when. You want them?\nPhoenix:\nNo.\n\n\n\n\nFruit attractions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nThis place is so fruity!\nPhoenix:\nThat\'s not a bad thing. Besides, I love apples. They\'re among my favorites.\nMaya:\nThen that apple slide is perfect for you!\nPhoenix:\n... And what is so "perfect" about it?\nMaya:\nOh come on. Don\'t be a stick in the mud! Slide down it a few times. Go on! Woo!\nPhoenix:\nNo way! I\'d get covered in sand if I slid down that slide. Anyone can see that.\nMaya:\nYeah, you\'re right. Otherwise, I\'d give it a try, too.\n\n\n\n\nPigeons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nHey, look. Pigeons!\nPhoenix:\nYeah. And heaps of them, too.\nMaya:\nDid you know that pigeons are a symbol of peace?\nPhoenix:\nThat\'s a dove, not a pigeon.\nMaya:\n... Poor things. Just because they\'re gray means they can\'t be symbols of peace and harmony?\nPhoenix:\nYou\'re over-thinking this one by just a smidge, Maya.\n\n\n\n\nMagazine on orange-themed seat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nOoh, there\'s a magazine here.\nPhoenix:\nIt\'s a magazine full of job listings.\nOld Man:\nYou disgusting rogue, picking up something someone else threw away!\nPhoenix:\n"Threw away"? Did you throw this away? Are you looking for a job?\nOld Man:\nKah! That\'s none of your business!\nPhoenix:\nSorry! I guess I\'ll take the magazine with me then.\nOld Man:\nI don\'t want anyone else having it! Give it back!\nPhoenix:\n(Too bad. Now that you want it so bad, I don\'t want to give it up!)\nJob Listings added to the Court Record.\nOld Man:\nHey! That\'s mine!\n\n\n\n\nCloser orange-themed seat (after examining magazine on orange-themed seat)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nLooking at this orange reminds me...\nPhoenix:\nOf what?\nMaya:\nThat you\'re supposed to eat a lot of them to ward off colds in the winter. You can\'t have fun during the holidays if you\'re sick in bed, you know.\nPhoenix:\nYou don\'t have to tell me twice.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat you saw\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... Excuse me.\nOld Man:\n...\nPhoenix:\nWould you mind if I had a word with you?\nOld Man:\nYes!\nPhoenix:\nI just want to ask you a couple of questions...\nOld Man:\nWhat\'s the matter with you!? Can\'t you see I\'m busy? So you don\'t like my seeds, eh, pigeons!?\nPhoenix:\n(He\'s really chucking those seeds at them! That\'s got to hurt!)\nOld Man:\nGo on! Eat this!\nPhoenix:\n(*sigh*)\n\n\n\n\nMaggey Byrde\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nExcuse me, sir. Can I ask you about Maggey Byrde?\nOld Man:\nI don\'t know any Maggey Byrde!\nMaya:\nYes, you do. Maggey. The waitress at Trés Bien.\nOld Man:\nKah! It\'s a disgrace, I tell you. An utter disgrace!\nMaya:\nA disgrace?\nOld Man:\nAn innocent young girl revealing herself like that!\nPhoenix:\nRevealing!? You mean her uniform?\nOld Man:\nThe youth of today! They don\'t have any shame! No shame, I tell you! Not one ounce! Whatever happened to the old bushido values of Japan, like honor and modesty?\nMaya:\nWhat about me? I\'m not wearing anything revealing.\nOld Man:\nYou!? Your problem is you lack any sense of grace!\nMaya:\nTalk about hitting a girl where it hurts...\n\n\n\n\nTrés Bien\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nDo you go to Trés Bien a lot?\nOld Man:\nHmph! That miserable excuse for a restaurant? That garbage they serve in there\'s not food. Where\'s the sushi? The tempura? The rice!?\nPhoenix:\nTrés Bien is a French restaurant, sir...\nOld Man:\nWhere do you think we are, boy? In Paris!? I want real food, not those snooty snacks! And what about those shameless girls!?\nPhoenix:\nYou mean the waitresses?\nOld Man:\nYou can see all the way up to their... their... Yes! The waitresses! They\'re practically naked! It\'s a disgrace, isn\'t it? Well, isn\'t it!?\nPhoenix:\nListen, it\'s not my restaurant.\nOld Man:\nKah! It\'s a miserable excuse for a restaurant, that place! Miserable!\nPhoenix:\n(He certainly knows the place. He must be a regular! But if he hates it so much, why does he keep going?)\n\n\n\n\nTrés Bien regular (appears after "Trés Bien")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nAre you a regular at that restaurant, sir?\nOld Man:\n...\nMaya:\nIt\'s just, if you dislike it so much, why would you keep going there?\nOld Man:\n...\nPhoenix:\nSir?\nOld Man:\nThere you are, you filthy pigeons! You want food? Ha-ha! Take that!\nMaya:\nHe must be hiding something, right?\nPhoenix:\nIf he is, I should be able to see a Psyche-Lock... Oh, wait... I don\'t exactly have the Magatama right now, huh...\nMaya:\nRemember, Nick. That Magatama is only on loan. You better find it or else!\nPhoenix:\n(If Pearls ever gets wind of this, I\'m going to be in a world of pain...)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm, excuse me, sir.

Why don\'t you take a job at the restaurant? I bet Mr. Armstrong would hire you.\nMaya:\nReally? Me?\nByrde:\nIt\'s pretty cool being a waitress, you know. And in the kitchen, you\'ll get to see all of the chef\'s greatest secrets!\nMaya:\nWhat secrets...?\nByrde:\nYou can\'t make it obvious, but just spy on him for a bit. You\'ll see. It\'s interesting.\nMaya:\nWow! I can\'t wait to get my apron on now!\nPhoenix:\nYeah, he has a pretty intense aroma, too.\nMaya:\nSo did Mr. Armstrong really not see the killer...?\nByrde:\nApparently not. Well, he\'s in the kitchen all the time, so I guess it\'s possible that he didn\'t.\n\n\n\n\nJean Armstrong profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nByrde:\nOh, so you met the owner, Mr. Armstrong!\nPhoenix:\nHe\'s, um... Oh, how can I put this... pretty unique, huh?\nByrde:\nHe has a really intense aura. As a chef and as a person.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, he has a pretty intense aroma, too.\nMaya:\nSo did Mr. Armstrong really not see the killer...?\nByrde:\nApparently not. Well, he\'s in the kitchen all the time, so I guess it\'s possible that he didn\'t.Trés BienExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash register (after presenting Job Listings)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt\'s really tight behind the cash register counter. Can Mr. Armstrong even get in there? And if he got in... could he get out again?\n\n\n\n\nTrinkets (after presenting Job Listings)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThere\'s a bunch of little trinkets on a shelf by the door. I bet Mr. Armstrong collected all of these personally.\n\n\n\n\nMagazine rack (after presenting Job Listings)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt\'s a rack full of fashion magazines. And they\'re all in French. Ugh. All the clothes in these are absolutely atrocious! ...Some of them have been circled in red. ... I really hope Mr. Armstrong is not thinking of buying those.\n\n\n\n\nTable (after presenting Job Listings)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMr. Armstrong must be a pretty big neat-freak. He already has this table ready to go. Now if only the food in this place was edible...\n\n\n\n\nWindows (after presenting Job Listings)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nIt looks pretty cold out there on the streets. Peaceful, though. It\'s nice that people can take it easy after the holiday rush.\n\n\n\n\nCrime scene (after presenting Job Listings)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThis must be the table where the poisoning occurred. The stain tells the story well. The whole area is still cordoned off with police tape. I guess it must still be under investigation.Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJob Listings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArmstrong:\nMademoiselle!\nMaya:\nY-Yes?\nArmstrong:\nAre you looking for la job?\nMaya:\nWhat!?

Maybe I should do both...?)Vitamin SquareExamine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSandbox\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhen I think back to when I was young... ...I wonder what I found so great about playing in a sandbox. Maybe I\'ll come back here in the middle of the night one of these days to relive it. ... On second thought, being arrested by Gumshoe would be too embarrassing to bear.\n\n\n\n\nFruit attractions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nYou don\'t see many parks like this anymore. What a great place for kids to play. But that old man\'s the only one here, chucking his seeds at the pigeons.\n\n\n\n\nPigeons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe pigeons are so busy pecking at the seeds, they don\'t notice anything else. Seeing those birds eat with such intense focus... ...reminds me of Maya when she\'s scarfing down a burger.\n\n\n\n\nCloser orange-themed seat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThis is where I found that job listings magazine before. A guy like me carrying around a magazine like that kind of gives the wrong impression.

Th-That\'s what it is! An innocent young girl revealing herself like that!\nPhoenix:\nSo, you didn\'t like that kind of thing, then?\nOld Man:\n... Wh-What are you trying to say about me, boy!? Explain yourself!\nPhoenix:\nUm, nothing! I\'m not saying anything about you...\nOld Man:\nI know your kind! You young ones with your spiky hair and your fancy suits!

You want food? Ha-ha! Take that!\nPhoenix:\n(Something\'s not right about this guy... But If he\'s hiding something, I should be able to see a Psyche-Lock.) Oh, wait... (I don\'t exactly have the Magatama right now, huh... I need to find it before I can get anywhere with this old man.)After presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien:January 6Detention CenterVisitor\'s RoomPhoenix:\nLooks like they have Maggey in questioning.

It looks like Mr. Armstrong\'s really taken a shine to her. I suppose I\'ll just have to let her work at the restaurant for a while.

He\'s mumbling something to himself.\nDetective:\n"Hitting the gas is like hitting the fast-forward button on your life." No. That\'s too obscure. You don\'t really get the "you\'ll die before your time" idea. I need something more direct. Something a bit more light-hearted. Something like, "Hitting the gas is your passport to paradise!"\nPhoenix:\n... He must be coming up with slogans for a safety campaign. ...I guess?\n\n\n\n\nChief\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThis must be the chief of the detectives here.

Meet the "Pink Badger".\nPhoenix:\nSo one\'s called "Blue", and the other\'s called "Pink", but they\'re both called "Badger"?\nChief:\nYou got it!

I-I mean, not too close. You know.\nPhoenix:\n...\nGumshoe:\n...... ......... Hey, what\'s with the funny looks, pal? I was with her... It wasn\'t anything like... Look!

You\'d have to be blind not to see what\'s on your mind.\n\n\n\n\nThe victim\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo I was wondering... Could you fill me in on the victim?\nGumshoe:\nGlen Elg, he was a computer programmer.\nPhoenix:\nI see. A programmer...\nGumshoe:\nHe was just a regular Joe working for a small-time computer firm. Maggey never had any contact with the guy before that day. ...And all she did was take him his coffee on the day of the murder, pal.\nPhoenix:\n(Yeah, Maggey also claimed to have never seen the guy before...) Did the victim go to the restaurant often?\nGumshoe:\nNot according to the chef. Said it was the first time he\'d seen the guy.\nPhoenix:\n(A programmer... and a first-time customer at that...) (Changed from [A programmer... and a first-time customer...] in the original release) What possible reason could Maggey have had to kill a guy like that?\nGumshoe:\nThat\'s what I thought. But a motive was still somehow established in her trial.\nPhoenix:\nYou\'re kidding! What was her supposed "motive"?\nGumshoe:\nSorry, pal. I\'m real busy. I haven\'t even got enough time to sift through these papers. Look into it yourself, OK?\nPhoenix:\n(What could this motive have been...?)\n\n\n\n\nThe investigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThis isn\'t really a proper investigation. I\'m kind of working on it by myself.\nPhoenix:\nO-Oh, that\'s right...\nGumshoe:\nThe judge already ruled on the case, and all the evidence is in already. The only problem is with Maggey\'s testimony.\nPhoenix:\nYeah... Doesn\'t sound very good for us, huh?\nGumshoe:\nLook, pal. I\'ve got a mountain of papers on this case to look over before tomorrow. So I\'m just gonna say this... Maggey Byrde\'s no liar. She\'s... She\'s... OK, so she\'s a bit out there, and a bit off base sometimes. But she was a good cop.\nPhoenix:\n(That\'s not exactly complimentary, you know!) So what do you think really happened? And just how contradictory is her testimony?\n\n\n\n\nContradictions (appears after "The investigation")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThe biggest problem with Maggey\'s testimony is the number of people at the table.\nPhoenix:\nYeah. My thoughts exactly. Maggey still insists there was another guy sitting with the victim.\nGumshoe:\nRight. But get this... Everyone else in the place says the guy was alone. Even the chef. And then there\'s that CD...\nPhoenix:\n(CD? Oh, yeah. She did mention something about a CD...)\n\n\nByrde:\nAnd there was a sample CD on the table, sir.\n\n\nGumshoe:\nBut our guys turned that place upside down. There was no CD.\nPhoenix:\nWhat?\nGumshoe:\nNot on the table. Not anywhere in the whole restaurant, pal.\nPhoenix:\nBut didn\'t Maggey say the victim was wearing an earpiece, too?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, but that was for the portable radio in the front pocket of his hoodie.\nPhoenix:\nA radio? He didn\'t have a CD player?\nGumshoe:\nYou got it. Your phony never explained that contradiction at all.\nPhoenix:\n(Come to think of it... The owner of Trés Bien didn\'t mention that CD either. I don\'t know why, but I get the feeling Mr. Armstrong\'s got something to hide...)\n\n\n\n\nThe charming chef (appears after presenting Jean Armstrong profile)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo what exactly is it that caught your attention about the chef at Trés Bien?\nGumshoe:\nIt\'s, um... kind of hard to say... The guy\'s probably not even connected with the case anyway...\nPhoenix:\nHey, come on, Detective. Didn\'t you say you\'d give me the dirt on anything?\nGumshoe:\nWell, this sort of stuff is kinda... unimportant, gossipy stuff, you know pal? Look, how about this? You go to Trés Bien and investigate the place yourself. And if you find out anything suspicious about the guy... you report back to me, OK?\nPhoenix:\nUm... Don\'t suppose I get a choice in this, huh? (Guess I better find out more about the chef and Trés Bien; then report back to Gumshoe.)Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney\'s Badge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nIs that thing real, pal?\nPhoenix:\nWhy does everybody keep asking me that?\nGumshoe:\nI wonder what this phony of yours is like...\nPhoenix:\nHe had Maggey found guilty of murder. Doesn\'t that tell you? (I\'ve got to track this creep down!)\n\n\n\n\nMagazine Clipping\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nI wasn\'t at the trial myself. But I asked this one detective I know how your defense was.\nPhoenix:\nAnd what did he say?\nGumshoe:\nHe started off by saying, "I\'m at a complete loss for words..." But he must have found some quick because he went on about how bad you were for an hour.\nPhoenix:\nBut...\nGumshoe:\nHe said you sucked so much, it seemed like you were trying to get Maggey found guilty!\nPhoenix:\n(It looked like I was "trying to get Maggey found guilty"...?)\n\n\n\n\nSports Paper\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nWhat\'s that? A sports paper?\nPhoenix:\nYeah. I found it in the magazine rack at Trés Bien.\nGumshoe:\nIt\'s dated the same day as the murder. You may be onto something here.\nPhoenix:\nAnd take a look at this. See this writing here?\nGumshoe:\n"MC Bomber"... Hey!\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it?\nGumshoe:\nI\'ve heard that name somewhere before. Yeah, "MC Bomber"...\nPhoenix:\n(Wow, he actually seems to be thinking for once!)\nGumshoe:\nAck, it\'s no good. I can\'t remember...\nPhoenix:\n(...And he goes back to being the Gumshoe we all know and love.)\nGumshoe:\nHey, pal. I\'m gonna borrow this paper for a bit, OK? I wanna get a handwriting analysis done on this scribble.\nPhoenix:\n(Handwriting, huh? It\'d be good to know more about that, in any case...)\nGumshoe:\nThanks, pal! I bet this\'ll turn out to be interesting clue!\nSports Paper given to Detective Gumshoe.\n\n\n\n\nMaya Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nHey! So how come she\'s not with you today?\nPhoenix:\nShe\'s working down at the restaurant right now.\nGumshoe:\nWorking, huh? Yeah, it\'s tough being broke. I would know.\nPhoenix:\nUm... OK...?\nGumshoe:\nNext time I see her, I\'ll show her how to make the world\'s best instant noodles. We low earners have to stick together! It\'s the only way!\nPhoenix:\n(Um... Why is he shaking my hand with such enthusiasm...?)\n\n\n\n\nMia Fey profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nShe cross-examined me once, you know.\nPhoenix:\nWhat? Mia did?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. That was us. The big guns locking horns. Witness versus lawyer! It was a battle of cunning tactics and tricks.\nPhoenix:\n(But the witness isn\'t supposed to play any tricks...)\nGumshoe:\nI can\'t believe she\'s gone...\n\n\n\n\nGodot profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThat\'s the guy who\'s gonna be the prosecutor in Maggey\'s retrial tomorrow.\nPhoenix:\nO-Oh, really?\nGumshoe:\nHe was working on a bunch of more important cases at the moment... ...but he canceled them all just so he could take you on, pal.\nPhoenix:\n(Why\'s that guy so determined to see me fail?)\nGumshoe:\nYou sure attract a lot of attention, huh? Too bad it\'s all the wrong kind.\n\n\n\n\nDick Gumshoe profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nI\'m such a loser. I had high hopes for Maggey. I was gonna make her the best detective there ever was. But then all the sudden she was charged with murder and arrested. I never saw it coming. I never imagined they\'d find her guilty. I hate myself for not being able to do anything.\nPhoenix:\nIt\'s OK, Detective Gumshoe. We still have a chance to make this right.\nGumshoe:\n... You know what? You\'re not such a bad guy after all, pal.\n\n\n\n\nMaggey Byrde profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHave you gone to see Maggey?\nGumshoe:\nOf course I have! But I... I wasn\'t much good at consoling her. I\'m... I\'m not very good with words.\nPhoenix:\nOh...\nGumshoe:\nYeah. I guess I must\'ve looked a bit down. Maggey was really supportive of me. It was great to have someone to talk to.\nPhoenix:\n(Did he go for her, or for himself...?)\n\n\n\n\nJean Armstrong profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGumshoe:\nThe chef of Trés Bien, huh? You know what that chef said to me? "Oh là là! Your body is full of la toxins." And then he gave me this bottle.\nPhoenix:\nWhat\'s in it?\nGumshoe:\nI don\'t know. The label says, "Juniper". I\'m under orders to put a few drops of it in my bath every day.\nPhoenix:\nUnder orders?\nOld Man:\nYeah. You know, there\'s something about the lady... I mean, guy.\nPhoenix:\nHuh!? You can\'t stop thinking about him!?\nGumshoe:\nNot like that, pal! Gimme a break! He\'s not my type. I mean, I can\'t stop thinking that he\'s involved with this case somehow!\nPhoenix:\n(Sounds like he knows a little something more about our charming chef.)\n\n\n\n\nAnything else\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat do you make of this...?\nGumshoe:\nSorry, pal. All I can think about is Maggey at the moment. ... ...... N-No! I didn\'t mean it like that! I meant...\nPhoenix:\n(You don\'t have to explain... Really...)After clearing all Talk options and presenting Sports Paper in Police Station - Criminal Affairs Dept.:January 6Trés BienPhoenix:\nThe scent of flowers sure is strong. It\'s almost making me dizzy... Oh, um... Hello. (Who was that just now? A customer? She had sort of a dark aura about her...)???:\nAh! Welcome! Bee avenue!Phoenix:\n(Wow. What a cute voice.)Maya:\nOh, it\'s just you, Nick.Phoenix:\nM-Maya!Maya:\nWell? How do I look?Phoenix:\n... Maybe you should quit being a spirit medium...Maya:\nMaybe. But it\'s kind of boring being a waitress. I mean, you\'re my first ever customer.Phoenix:\n(Then who was that woman I just saw?)Maya:\nOh, oh! Since you\'re here, you might as well have something to eat!Phoenix:\n... I am kind of hungry, actually.Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWaitress\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, how do you like your new job, Maya?\nMaya:\nI never knew there was so much for a waitress to do! Take people\'s orders, bringing them their food, make coffee, work the cash register... Of course, we need a customer before I can do any of that.\nPhoenix:\nYeah, it\'s a nice-looking restaurant. It\'s a shame more people don\'t come.\nMaya:\nDon\'t forget about the ultra cute waitress! Check out my "gimme a tip" smile!\n\n\n\n\nLunch special\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nHey, Nick! Why don\'t you order something? The chef\'s preparing a tasty lunch set at the moment. Or so he says.\nPhoenix:\nHow much is it?\nMaya:\nIt\'s the Twin-T set. So it\'s 20 dollars, of course.\nPhoenix:\nThe Twin-T set? I believe I\'ll be taking a pass. It\'s kind of expensive.\nMaya:\nWhat!? But you can\'t! Come on, Nick! It\'s not every day I get to be a waitress! I want to try carrying plates and working the cash register!\nPhoenix:\nHow about cleaning the toilets? That should keep you busy.\nMaya:\nYeah, right! Maybe later.Present\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nAbout this...\nMaya:\nSorry, Nick! I\'m a waitress now. I\'ve got a pile of work waiting for little ol\' me.After clearing all Talk options:Phoenix:\nUm... About the lunch...Maya:\nOh! A fine choice, sir.Phoenix:\nNo. I, um...Maya:\nKITCHEN! A LUNCH SPECIAL, PLEASE! WITH ALL THE EXTRAS: DRINK, SIDE SALAD, DESSERT, AND GIFT!Phoenix:\nI don\'t need any of that!Maya:\nJust a moment, please, sir.Phoenix:\n(Maya\'s really getting into this! So how much is this set lunch, then? 20 dollars, huh? But with the drink, side salad, and dessert, it\'s... 45 dollars!?) Hey, wait a sec! Maya!Maya:\nSorry to keep you waiting, sir! Here you are, our deluxe Fortify lunch set!Phoenix:\nWhoa!Maya:\nA dish inspired by lobster and abalone fricassée with balsamic vinaigrette. Bon appétit!Phoenix:\nUm, thanks...?Maya:\nCome on, Nick! Hurry up and try it already!Phoenix:\n(Lobster, huh? Alright... Down the hatch it goes...) ... Urp!Maya:\nWell?Phoenix:\nAre you hungry, Maya?Maya:\nI\'m starving!Phoenix:\nHere. It\'s yours.Maya:\nReally!? ... Urp!Phoenix:\nRemember, Maya. My wallet doesn\'t print money, so you\'d better polish off that plate!Maya:\n... I-I\'ve just remembered! I\'ve got to clean the toilets!Phoenix:\nHey! (You can\'t be in that much of a hurry to clean the toilets!)Trés Bien Lunch Special added to the Court Record.Phoenix:\nHow does that guy manage to make good food taste so bad?Maya:\nHey, Nick... You want to take a peek at the kitchen?Phoenix:\n(The kitchen, huh? Not a bad idea.)Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKitchen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nHmm, now what was it that Maggey said again? "In the kitchen, you\'ll get to see all of the chef\'s greatest secrets!"\nMaya:\nIn the kitchen? Mmm. That sounds tasty!\nPhoenix:\nHey, wait up! Maya!\nMaya:\nWhat is it? I\'m pretty busy right now.\nPhoenix:\nWeren\'t you going to show me around?\nMaya:\nTsk. There goes my plan to find some cool clue and show it off in your face...\nPhoenix:\n(I\'d better conduct the search in the kitchen myself!)After clearing "Kitchen" Talk option in Trés Bien:January 6Trés BienKitchenMaya:\nAnd here it is! The famous Trés Bien kitchen! It\'s my first time in here too, actually.Phoenix:\n... There is a weird atmosphere in here, that\'s for sure.Maya:\nMr. Armstrong will be back soon, so we\'d better search quickly! Chop, chop!Examine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMirror\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nNow THIS is one large mirror! I bet this is where he makes himself look pretty.\nPhoenix:\nThere\'s a book on the dresser. "Claurice Armstrong\'s Bedtime Literature".\nMaya:\nNot exactly Pulitzer Prize material, is it?\nPhoenix:\nIt looks like a collection of poems he\'s written.\nMaya:\nPoems? Cool! Read one out! And say it in your best French accent... with intensity! OK?\nPhoenix:\nOK, um... Here\'s one. Ahem! It\'s called, "Printemps". "Zee two of zem, like actors from a film. Zee coffee still undrunk. Sweet nothings over too soon, on zat sad Sunday morning. Zee foolish cocktail so delicious. Take zee last sip of your tea and I know what I will do. I must lie to you. I must."\nMaya:\nHuh? That\'s it!?\nPhoenix:\nYup. That\'s a poem for you.\n\n\n\n\nOil bottles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat\'s this? It looks like a treasure chest or something.\nMaya:\nWow! Look at all these little bottles!\nPhoenix:\nOh! They\'re aromatherapy oils! He\'s got so many, they\'re overflowing onto the floor...\nMaya:\nLet\'s see... 1, 2, 3... ...98, 99, 100! They\'re all the same, too. Hey, wait a minute...\nPhoenix:\nWhat is it?\nMaya:\nThere\'s one bottle that\'s different from all the others.\nPhoenix:\nWell what do you know. And it doesn\'t have a label either.\nMaya:\nAnd... *sniff* It doesn\'t smell.\nPhoenix:\n(So what\'s that liquid inside then, I wonder?)\nMaya:\nHey, Nick, we should borrow this. I mean, look how many bottles he\'s got. He won\'t miss one, will he?\nSmall Bottle added to the Court Record.\n\n\n\n\nOil bottles (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWhat\'s this?

Lace curtains... You know, if I was a cooking pot, I\'d be perfectly happy to sit on a shelf under those.\nPhoenix:\n(How do you respond to something like that!?)\n\n\n\n\nTable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nNow I know for sure I\'m in a French restaurant. I\'ve never heard of most of these seasonings. Hey, Nick! This container has... oyster sauce? What\'s that?\nPhoenix:\n(Isn\'t that used in Chinese food...?) Ack! Look! Right there on the counter!\nMaya:\nMy Magatama! What\'s it doing there!?\nPhoenix:\n(What indeed...)\nMagatama put into pocket.\n\n\n\n\nTable (subsequent times)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nNow I know for sure I\'m in a French restaurant.

They look really sharp!\nPhoenix:\nI\'d like to see how one of those slices through a cheesecake.\nMaya:\nA cheesecake? You don\'t exactly need a sharp knife for one of those, Nick.\n\n\n\n\nStove\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaya:\nMmm. That smells good. Something\'s bubbling away nicely in that pot. It must be the lobster and abalone fricassée with balsamic vinaigrette.\nPhoenix:\nIsn\'t that what I just ate for lunch?\nMaya:\nMaybe... What you ate is the only French dish I know the name of.After examining oil bottles in Trés Bien - Kitchen:January 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept.Gumshoe:\nHey, you\'re just in time!Phoenix:\nWhat is it, Detective Gumshoe?Gumshoe:\nThe lab got back to me about that newspaper you gave me.Phoenix:\n(He must mean this sports paper with the memo scribbled on it...) So? What did they say? Did the analysis turn up anything?Gumshoe:\nThey said the doodle was written by the victim, Glen Elg. No doubt about it.Phoenix:\n(I expected as much...)Gumshoe:\nThe victim took the paper with him to the restaurant on the day of the murder. That\'s our best interpretation of the facts at the moment.Sports Paper refiled into the Court Record.Gumshoe:\n"MC Bomber"... I get the feeling I\'ve heard that name somewhere before... Oh, well. I guess it\'ll come back to me. Don\'t forget to report back to me with whatever you find in the restaurant, OK, pal?Phoenix:\n(Since when did I start taking orders from Gumshoe...? Although...

Yes...\nGumshoe:\nSo, how was it?\nPhoenix:\nTo put it nicely... it was inedible.\nGumshoe:\nHey, don\'t worry about being nice around me, pal. You and I both know the reason that place is so empty is because of the food. I mean, the place is clean, and he\'s got a girl like Maggey as a waitress, so...\nPhoenix:\nYeah... I guess it\'s probably the food.\nGumshoe:\nThe real scoop on the guy is he\'s up to his ears in debt.\nPhoenix:\nReally? How much does he owe?\nGumshoe:\nThis is a copy of his loan contract. He\'s about half a million in the red.\nPhoenix:\nH-Half a million? Are we talking dollars?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. Hey, if it was Sterling, he\'d really be in trouble!\nPhoenix:\nSorry.

You said you took a ticket!Armstrong:\nMais non, ma fille! It was not...???:\nThat\'s enough.Maya:\nHuh? AAAAAAAAAH! Mr. Godot!Phoenix:\nWhat in the heck are you doing here!?Godot:\nUrgh! This is without doubt... the worst coffee I have ever tasted, Mr. Armstrong.Phoenix:\n(He came in here for coffee!? Does his craving for coffee know no bounds!?)Godot:\nPerhaps Mr. Armstrong stole one of the victim\'s tickets on the day in question.Armstrong:\nI am la air\'ead, non? Just a pretty little girl who everyone is laughing at.Maya:\nBut, in that case, Maggey shouldn\'t be the only one under suspicion...Godot:\nHe had the wrong ticket.Phoenix:\n...What?Godot:\nMr. Armstrong made off with the winning ticket\'s pretty neighbor.Maya:\nSo... the ticket he took was worthless?Godot:\nNot quite. He did win something. A dollar.Armstrong:\nYou see! I am just a pretty face! W\'izout my looks, I \'ave nothing!Phoenix:\nSo... What happened to the winning ticket, then? The one he meant to steal.Godot:\nIndeed. What did happen to it? I don\'t like spoiling myself by watching trailers, so... ...we\'ll just wait and see how the movie turns out tomorrow, won\'t we?Maya:\nNngh...Armstrong:\nVoilà! You two! Time to laugh at la pretty little air\'ead!Phoenix:\n(Looks like I won\'t be needing this note anymore.)Victor\'s Note thrown into the trash.Phoenix:\nLooks like we\'ve got a new mystery now. Namely, where did the winning ticket go?Maya:\nI\'ve got a bad feeling about this.Phoenix:\nWell, anyway. We can\'t let Maggey suffer any longer for this. And certainly not again.To be continued.Nothing to examine during investigation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nNo clues here.Exit Magatama session\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I don\'t think I have enough evidence yet...

D-Detective Gumshoe!Gumshoe:\nA-Are you doing alright!? How\'re you feeling!?Byrde:\n...As if you need to ask either question, sir.Gumshoe:\nDon\'t let \'em get you down, Maggey. And don\'t forget to eat well, OK?Byrde:\nRoger!Gumshoe:\nAnd you!Phoenix:\nY-Yes?Gumshoe:\nYou\'d better square this case away, got it pal!? Maggey\'s innocent, you hear!? If you screw up, then I\'ll be doing some squaring away myself. Squaring away some paperwork for your arrest!Phoenix:\n(I-I think he\'s serious!)Maya:\nHey, Detective! You\'re on our side for once, right?Gumshoe:\nYup.Maya:\nSo you\'ll be able to help Maggey out, right?Byrde:\nReally? Can you, sir!?Gumshoe:\nO... Of course! I\'ve got the simulation under control! I\'m gonna be the first witness on the stand today. If something I say doesn\'t mesh with the facts, make sure you point it out, alright?Phoenix:\nS-Sure.Gumshoe:\nOK. We\'re forming a united front today, pal. You get me!?Byrde:\nI can\'t tell you how grateful I am, sir! I\'ve always admired you so much, Detective. I know I can count on you.Maya:\nLooks like it should all go pretty smoothly today, huh?Phoenix:\n(I can only wish...)January 7, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Maggey Byrde.Phoenix:\nThe defense is ready, Your Honor.Godot:\n... Aaah, bitter!Judge:\nMr... Um... Mr. Wright.Phoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor?Judge:\nAaaah!Phoenix:\nWh-What\'s wrong!?Judge:\nNothing. It\'s just whenever I addressed you in the previous trial, your response was... "Youse talkin\' to me!?" It was a little, well... intimidating.Phoenix:\nNo, no! That wasn\'t me. That was the phony Phoenix.Judge:\nI see. So our trusty Phoenix Wright is back with us now, is he?Phoenix:\n("Our trusty"...?)Judge:\nSo, Mr. Godot. Your opening statement, please.Godot:\nMr. Trite... Whether you\'re a fake or the real deal... We will find out soon enough through this trial today.Phoenix:\nBut I can already tell you! I\'m the real Phoenix Wright!Godot:\nI wasn\'t questioning whether you are Phoenix Wright or not. I was questioning whether you had studied law or not. That\'s what I intend to find out.Phoenix:\n(There\'s no denying it. Behind that mask is a man who really hates me for some reason or another!)Judge:\nAs everyone is aware, the court has already given its verdict on this case once. Therefore, I won\'t stand for irrelevant testimony during this retrial. Nor will I stand for a simple repetition of the evidence presented in the last trial.Phoenix:\n(I\'m not planning on repeating anything that phony me said! Trust me!)Judge:\nNow then. Mr. Godot, please summon your first witness.Godot:\nLet\'s start with the formalities, shall we? Name and occupation?Gumshoe:\n...Judge:\nWitness! State your name for the court!Gumshoe:\nHuh? Oh, sorry, sir! The name\'s Police Department Detective. Occupation, Dick Gumshoe.Godot:\nOther way around, Detective.Gumshoe:\nHuh? Oh! Sorry. Anyway, I\'m the officer in charge of this case since yesterday. Sir!Judge:\nSince yesterday?Gumshoe:\nYeah. The guy who was on the initial investigation\'s tied up with another case now.Maya:\nI hope Gumshoe\'s really got everything under control... For everyone\'s sake.Judge:\nI see. So, Detective Gumshoe... Would you outline for the court the basic facts of the case?Gumshoe:\nY-Y-Yes, sir. The victim\'s name was Glen Elg. He was a professional programmer. He was on the payroll of Blue Screens Inc., a local company. This is the victim\'s autopsy report.Judge:\nThe court accepts this into evidence.Glen\'s Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.Gumshoe:\nUm... And here are the floor plans of the restaurant. When the incident took place, the victim was sitting right here. The poisoned coffee was brought over to him by the, um... By the waitress.Judge:\nThe waitress being the accused?Gumshoe:\nYeah... The victim died from poisoning almost immediately after he took a sip of the coffee. At the time of the incident, there were two other people in the restaurant. Mr. Jean Armstrong, the owner and chef. And a regular by the name of Mr. Victor Kudo.Judge:\nHmm... It still seems to be a very straightforward case to me.Trés Bien Floor Plans added to the Court Record.Godot:\nCome, Detective. Take up this hammer. And nail the defendant\'s coffin shut with your own two hands.Judge:\nNow then, Detective Gumshoe. Let\'s have your testimony.Gumshoe:\nUmm... Yes, sir...Witness Testimony-- The Incident --Gumshoe:\nWhen the incident took place, the victim was alone at his table, sir.\nWe understand that the guy, Glen Elg, was listening to the radio at the time.\nTraces of poison were found in his coffee cup.\nAnd what we found was potassium cyanide. That stuff really packs a punch!\nAnd, um... it looks like Ms. Byrde might\'ve had, well... some kind of a motive.Judge:\nHmm...Godot:\nUsing the dark, aromatic depths of coffee to conceal the poison... Classy lady!Judge:\nThe facts of this case seem to be ironclad. Mr. Wright. I would ask you to begin your cross-examination, but...Phoenix:\nYes?Judge:\nPlease, no intimidation tricks this time around. Is that understood?Phoenix:\nI already told you! That wasn\'t me!Cross Examination-- The Incident --Gumshoe:\nWhen the incident took place, the victim was alone at his table, sir.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nCan I stop you for just a minute?\nGumshoe:\nHuh? What is it? Did I say something that contradicts the evidence?\nPhoenix:\n(He\'d so desperate for that to be true, he\'s practically crying!) Your testimony just now doesn\'t match the testimony given by Ms. Byrde. She claims that there was another man at the victim\'s table.\nGumshoe:\nYeah, that\'s what she said. And I--\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nWhat killer wouldn\'t say that when faced with a homicide conviction?\nPhoenix:\nHey!\nGodot:\nSadly, her testimony isn\'t supported by the owner or the other customer. Isn\'t that right, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nYeah, it\'s true. Their two testimonies tie up on that. They both said there was no other guy at the table.\nJudge:\nHmm...\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, I should leave it alone. I\'ve got a bad feeling about where this is going.)\nMaya:\nIf you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad.\nPhoenix:\n...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony.\nLeads back to cross-examination\n\n\n\n\nPress harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nWell, maybe the other witnesses just missed him! Perhaps their view of the victim\'s table was obscured in some way.\nGodot:\nHa...! That argument is as weak as the coffee at Trés Bien, Trite!\nPhoenix:\n...!\nGodot:\nI have here in my possession a ticket.\nPhoenix:\nA ticket? (Looks more like a photo to me.)\nGodot:\nYes. A one-way ticket to guilty-ville! Population: the defendant! This is a photograph taken from near the entrance to the kitchen.\nJudge:\nThis is the scene as witnessed by the chef, moments after the poisoning took place, correct?\nGodot:\nI think the court will agree that with such a clear view of the scene of the crime... ...how, Mr. Trite, could anyone have overlooked a second person at the table?\nPhoenix:\nUrk!\nJudge:\nIt certainly seems to show the victim\'s table extremely clearly.\nCrime Photo added to the Court Record.\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after Crime Photo is added to the Court Record)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nCan I stop you for just a minute?\nGumshoe:\nHuh?

He had a portable radio in his chest pocket.\nMaya:\nMaggey told us that too, didn\'t she? Something about how "one of them had some sort of earpiece".\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, I should leave it alone.

How should I know?\nPhoenix:\n(Thanks a lot... We\'re now one step closer to the middle of nowhere.)\nMaya:\nThis isn\'t going very well, is it...?\nJudge:\nHmm... Detective. Could you perhaps tell us about the poison and how it was used?\nLeads back to cross-examinationGumshoe:\nTraces of poison were found in his coffee cup.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, traces of the poison were found in the coffee cup and nowhere else?\nGumshoe:\nNot sure I get you, pal.\nPhoenix:\nWas the poison a liquid? Or was it a powder?\nGumshoe:\nIf I had to put it in layman\'s terms, I\'d say it was a powdery substance.\nPhoenix:\nSo the poison could\'ve been in anything that was on the table. Sugar, salt, pepper...\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nHa...! Do you put salt and pepper in your coffee, Trite?\nGumshoe:\nThe victim took his coffee black, with no sugar.\nPhoenix:\nNngh...\nJudge:\nIt seems that the poison could only have been in the coffee.\nPhoenix:\n(What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, I should leave it alone.

What do you mean?\nPhoenix:\nAccording to this file, "the poison was found in the victim\'s coffee cup." But what proof is there that the victim ever drank any of it!?\nGumshoe:\nOh, hey! You\'re right! That\'s what I was think--\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nIn case you were wondering, that last objection was for the detective there.\nGumshoe:\nHuh? For me?\nGodot:\n"Oh, hey! You\'re right!"? You may be fooling the court, but I\'m not falling for it. If you have the time to waste, you have the time to present that piece of evidence.\nGumshoe:\nTh... THAT piece... sir?\nGodot:\nYes. THAT piece.\nGumshoe:\n... Um... Aheh heh heh! Wh-What piece was it again?\nGodot:\nThis!\nPhoenix:\n(Should I be grateful this coffee\'s only hot enough to give me 1st degree burns...?)\nGumshoe:\nOh. Now I remember! Um... This is the, uh... victim\'s coffee cup.\nGodot:\nYes, the victim\'s cup. Take a good look at the rim.\nJudge:\nOh, yes. It\'s unmistakable. There is clearly a coffee stain on it.\nGodot:\nConclusive proof that the victim did drink the poisoned coffee that was in this cup. The victim gulped down the bitter death that the waitress brought to him... like this!\nPhoenix:\nUuuurgh!\nGumshoe:\nFor the record, the only prints on the cup were the victim\'s and the defendant\'s.\nCoffee Cup added to the Court Record.\nGumshoe:\nUpon further investigation of this cup... we found a certain chemical substance...\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after Coffee Cup is added to the Court Record)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\nSo, traces of the poison were found in the coffee cup and nowhere else?\nGumshoe:\nNot sure I get you, pal.\nPhoenix:\nWas the poison a liquid?

That stuff really packs a punch!Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n(Potassium cyanide? I\'ve heard of that chemical before...) Exactly how strong is this poison, Detective Gumshoe?\nGumshoe:\nIt\'s... Well... That stuff\'s lethal! Eat too much, and you\'re history.\nMaya:\nHow much is too much?\nGodot:\nA lethal dose is 0.2 grams. That\'s about enough to finish anyone off.\nMaya:\n0.2 grams? How much is that?\nGumshoe:\nYou know when you swab your ears for earwax? Yeah, about that much.\nPhoenix:\n(Earwax, huh? Sounds like something Gumshoe\'s got an abundance of...)\nJudge:\nHmm... Such a small quantity of poison could have been concealed anywhere.Gumshoe:\nAnd, um... it looks like Ms. Byrde might\'ve had, well... some kind of a motive.Press\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n"Some kind of a motive"?\nGumshoe:\nYeah. But if you ask me, it\'s been blown way out of proportion.\nGodot:\n\nGodot:\nYou know what my golden rule is, Detective? Chuck out a bad cup of coffee. You can always get another.\nGumshoe:\nHuh? I don\'t get it.\nGodot:\nI\'m saying, we can always get another witness on the stand, if we have to chuck you out.\nGumshoe:\n*gulp*\nGodot:\nSo stick to the facts, Detective. Now then, what was Ms. Byrde\'s motive?\nPhoenix:\n(Come on, Gumshoe...)\nGumshoe:\nShe was... They said she wanted to steal a lottery ticket.\nPhoenix:\nI knew it... (That\'s what we heard yesterday, too.)\nGumshoe:\nIt disappeared from the scene of the crime.\nGodot:\nAnd it wasn\'t just any lottery ticket. It was a winning ticket for half a million!\nMaya:\nMr. Armstrong knew about the ticket too, didn\'t he? But he stole the wrong one...\nPhoenix:\n(Then is it possible Maggey stole the winning one? What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?)\n\n\n\nLeave it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(No, I should leave it alone. I\'ve got a bad feeling about where this is going.)\nMaya:\nIf you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling.

The mere fact that the lottery ticket disappeared in no way implicates my client!\nGodot:\nHa...! I have here in my hand... the very ticket in question!\nJudge:\nTh-That\'s the half a million dollar lottery ticket...?\nGumshoe:\nOne of the female police officers found it when she was conducting a search... ...of the defendant.\nPhoenix:\nWH-WHAAAAAT!?\nJudge:\nOrder! Order!\nGodot:\nHa...! She\'s quite a lucky bird, our little waitress.\nJudge:\nY-You will submit that ticket as evidence to the court! Immediately!\nPhoenix:\n(Hmm, I\'d better keep an eye on that ticket. The way the judge\'s voice is quivering...)\nVictim\'s Lottery Ticket added to the Court Record.\nJudge:\nThe ticket was presented to the court in the previous trial, too. But it feels heavier now somehow. H-Half a million dollars, you say...?\nGodot:\nIt\'s just a scrap of paper. What matters is where it was found, Your Honor.\nPhoenix:\n(And that\'s on Maggey\'s person, unfortunately...) (Changed from [I bet he wants to say it was found on Maggey\'s person...] in the original release)\nLeads back to cross-examinationPress (after Victim\'s Lottery Ticket is added to the Court Record)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n\nPhoenix:\n"Some kind of a motive"?\nGumshoe:\nYeah.

But he stole the wrong one...\nPhoenix:\n(Then is it possible Maggey stole the winning one?)Maya:\nYou really think there are any contradictions in this testimony?Phoenix:\nTo be honest, I don\'t know.Maya:\nBut Gumshoe told us out in the lobby. He said we\'d be forming a united front, right? How will we win the case if he doesn\'t throw us a line?Phoenix:\n(I don\'t have a whole lot of options right now... The best I can do is gather the facts together, I guess.)After selecting "Press harder" upon pressing first, third, and fifth statements:Judge:\nThat\'s enough! The facts of this case seem overwhelmingly clear to me. The defendant had ample opportunity to commit the crime of which she is charged. Furthermore, it seems beyond reasonable doubt that she did indeed commit this crime.Godot:\nI like an old man who knows the score.Judge:\nThere is also the matter of the half a million dollar lottery ticket. That alone provides a very credible motive. I mean, for that sum of money even I might be tempted to bend the rules!Godot:\nI don\'t mind an old man who is weak to the siren call of money.Maya:\nNot good, Nick... The evidence against Maggey is starting to pile up fast.Phoenix:\nYeah, that\'s because the court has ruled guilty once already.Godot:\nI\'d say it\'s about time to wrap up this repeat performance... ...with one final, decisive piece of evidence.Phoenix:\n(He\'s got more evidence against Maggey!?)Godot:\nThis is the apron the delightful Ms. Byrde was wearing at the time.Maya:\nWow... That\'s not the cleanest apron I\'ve seen...Phoenix:\nTh-That stain looks like...! (It can\'t be... blood, can it!?)Godot:\nHa...! It seems the star of our play was a little flustered... And somehow spilled coffee on herself.Phoenix:\nThe coffee!? That\'s not exactly the first thing that caught my eye...Godot:\nOf course. The coffee stain isn\'t the most interesting thing about this apron. No, there\'s something else that stands out even more.Judge:\nSomething else? I presume you mean...Godot:\nOf course. I\'m referring to the pocket.Phoenix:\nThe... pocket?Godot:\nA search carried out right after the incident uncovered this... Potassium cyanide. The very poison used by the killer, was in her apron pocket!Phoenix:\nA bottle of poison... In Maggey\'s pocket?Gumshoe:\nYeah. And Maggey\'s prints were the only ones on it.Phoenix:\nWHAAAT!?Judge:\nOrder! Order! Order! The court will accept these items into evidence.Apron added to the Court Record.Potassium Cyanide added to the Court Record.Judge:\nThere\'s something still bothering me, Mr. Godot. Why have you not explained the bloodstain to the court?Godot:\nBloodstain? What bloodstain would that be?Judge:\nDon\'t play games, prosecutor! The blood-colored stain that\'s smeared all over the apron!Godot:\nThat\'s ridiculous! No one told me anything about a bloodstain!Phoenix:\n(You don\'t need to be told! Just look at it!)Godot:\nWell, Detective!? Could this stain really be... BLOOD!?Gumshoe:\nN-No way, sir! That\'s... It\'s just ketchup. Sir.Phoenix:\nKetchup!?Gumshoe:\nShe must\'ve gotten some on her an apron while taking someone their breakfast that day.Judge:\n... You could have spoken up a little sooner, Detective Gumshoe!Godot:\nPull a stunt like that again, and I\'ll have you drink 17 cups of ketchup, witness!Gumshoe:\nUnnngh... I thought everyone knew what it was already.Judge:\nHmm... I haven\'t seen anything yet to make me doubt the last verdict I ruled on this case.Phoenix:\n...!Judge:\nThe motive, the opportunity, and the supporting evidence... They have all been clearly established.Godot:\nWell, Trite... It seems you really are a phony after all.Phoenix:\n(Argh! You really know how to drive a man nuts!)Judge:\nWitness, please continue with your testimony. Describe for the court the crime scene and the findings of your investigation there.Witness Testimony-- The Investigation --Gumshoe:\nThe crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.\nPoor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must\'ve been real tough for her.\nThe victim didn\'t have any identification on him.\nBut we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly.\nWhen Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison.\nAnd that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene.Judge:\nHmm... You identified the victim and secured your prime suspect... Very good.Godot:\nLast chance to convince the court you\'re a real lawyer, Trite!Phoenix:\n...!Godot:\nDon\'t court on any more cross-examinations after this one!

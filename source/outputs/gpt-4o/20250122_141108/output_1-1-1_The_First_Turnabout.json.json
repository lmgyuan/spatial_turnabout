    "response": "To find contradictions in Frank Sahwit's testimony, we must carefully align his statements with the available evidence. Let's break down the testimony and compare it with the evidence provided to identify any inconsistencies.\n\n### Frank Sahwit\u2019s Testimony:\n- **Statement 8**: \"I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.\" \n\n### Available Evidence:\n- **Cindy's Autopsy Report**: The time of death was between 4 PM and 5 PM.\n\n### Analysis:\n- Frank Sahwit claims he remembers the time specifically as 1:00 PM when he made the crucial observations. However, the autopsy report indicates Cindy Stone could not have been dead at that time because her death occurred between 4 PM and 5 PM. \n\nThis discrepancy suggests that if Sahwit truly saw the body at 1:00 PM, she wouldn't have been dead yet, as the time frame given by the autopsy hadn't begun. This inconsistency calls into question the accuracy of his testimony.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe contradiction lies between the time Sahwit remembers (1:00 PM) and the autopsy report\u2019s official time of death (4 PM-5 PM). We present the autopsy report as evidence to counter Sahwit's testimony about the time.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"present\",\n  \"testimony\": 8,\n  \"evidence\": 1\n}\n```"

    "response": "To uncover the contradiction in Frank Sahwit's testimony, we need to compare the evidence with his statements.\n\nFrom the beginning, Sahwit mentions that when he found the body, he heard a voice announcing the time, which he assumed came from a television. He further elaborates that the time he heard was three hours off, implying that the victim was likely watching a pre-recorded television program.\n\nHowever, one of the key items of evidence is the Blackout Record. It notes that the electricity in Ms. Stone's building was out from noon to 6 PM on the day of the crime. If the electricity was indeed out during that time, it would have been impossible for the television to be on, thereby negating Sahwit's claim of hearing the time from there.\n\nWe need to present this contradiction. Sahwit specifically claims during testimony 1 that he heard the time when he \"found the body,\" thinking it came from the television. The Blackout Record, evidence 4, directly contradicts the possibility of a television being operational during the time of the blackout.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"present\", \"testimony\": 1, \"evidence\": 4}\n```"

    "response": "To find the contradiction in the testimony, let's analyze the new testimony by Frank Sahwit:\n\n**Testimony Analysis:**\n1. **Sahwit:** \"Actually, I didn't 'hear' the time... I 'saw' it!\"\n   - **Observation:** Sahwit changes his statement, claiming he saw the time instead of hearing it.\n\n2. **Sahwit:** \"There was a table clock in the apartment, wasn't there!\"\n   - **Observation:** He now claims a table clock was present, allowing him to see the time.\n\n3. **Sahwit:** \"Yeah, the murder weapon! The killer used it to hit the victim!\"\n   - **Observation:** He refers to the murder weapon as a clock, which conflicts with the evidence list because the murder weapon is a statue in the shape of \"The Thinker.\"\n\n4. **Sahwit:** \"That must have been what I saw.\"\n   - **Observation:** He insists what he saw was what allowed him to determine the time.\n\n**Evidence Examination:**\n- **Statue:** A statue in the shape of \"The Thinker.\" It's rather heavy. Listed as the murder weapon and nowhere mentioned as having a clock function, contradicts Sahwit's testimony.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The contradiction lies in Sahwit\u2019s claim that the murder weapon was a clock. The evidence shows that the murder weapon was a heavy statue shaped like \"The Thinker.\" There is no indication in the evidence that this item functions as a clock. The testimony stating the murder weapon was a clock should be disputed using the evidence of the statue.\n\nTherefore, the correct action is to present the statue evidence against the testimony point where Sahwit claims the murder weapon was a clock.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"present\",\n  \"testimony\": 2,\n  \"evidence\": 2\n}\n```"

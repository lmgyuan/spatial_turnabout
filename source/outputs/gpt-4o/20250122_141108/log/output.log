The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say it was you...)Phoenix:\nMy name is Phoenix Wright. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\" In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!August 3, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.

I'm drawing a total blank here!)Mia:\nPhoenix! Are you absolutely SURE you're up to this? You don't even know the victim's name!?Phoenix:\nOh, the victim! O-Of course I know the victim's name!

(Because I don't FEEL relaxed, that's for sure.)Judge:\nWell, then... First, a question for the prosecution. Mr. Payne?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nAs Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to the court just what that \"object\" was?Payne:\nThe murder weapon was this statue of \"The Thinker.\" It was found lying on the floor, next to the victim.Judge:\nI see... The court accepts it into evidence. (Changed from [I see... the court accepts it into evidence.] in the original release)Statue added to the Court Record.Mia:\nWright...

WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?Payne:\nMr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by \"dumped.\" In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!Butz:\nWhaddya mean, \"one of them\"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!Payne:\nYour Honor, the victim's passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.Passport added to the Court Record.Judge:\nHmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.Butz:\nDude... no way...Payne:\nThe victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several \"Sugar Daddies.\"Butz:\nDaddies? Sugar?Payne:\nYes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.Butz:\nDuuude!Payne:\nWe can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?Mia:\nWright... I don't think you want him to answer that question.Phoenix:\n(Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions.

I'm just gonna drop dead!\"Butz:\nI'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I'm going to get to the bottom of this!Judge:\nLet's continue with the trial, shall we?Payne:\nI believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.Judge:\nYes, quite.Phoenix:\n(Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)Payne:\nNext question! You went to the victim's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?Butz:\nGulp!Payne:\nWell, did you, or did you not?Butz:\nHeh? Heh heh.

Well then, we'll just have to remind you!\nPhoenix:\n(I got a bad feeling about this...)\nPayne:\nWe have a witness that can prove he DID go to the victim's apartment that day!\nLeads to:\n\"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?\"Judge:\nWell, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?Payne:\nThe man who found the victim's body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw the defendant fleeing the scene of the crime!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.Payne:\nYes, Your Honor.Phoenix:\n(This is bad...)Payne:\nOn the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim's building.

However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor...

Er... yes, Your Honor?Judge:\nYou may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:\nC-Cross-examination, Your Honor?Mia:\nAlright, Wright, this is it. The real deal!Phoenix:\nUh... what exactly am I supposed to do?Mia:\nWhy, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!Phoenix:\nLies! What?! He was lying!?Mia:\nYour client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?Phoenix:\n!!! How do I prove he's not?Mia:\nYou hold the key! It's in the evidence! Compare the witness's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there!

During the cross-examination, identify the contradiction in the witness's testimony by presenting the appropriate evidence at the correct statement.
In this example, the witness claims to remember the time exactly as 1:00 PM, but the Cindy's Autopsy Report records the time of death between 4 PM-5 PM. This discrepancy can be presented as evidence to contradict the witness's statement.

Answer:
{
  "action": "present",
  "testimony": 9,
  "evidence": 2
}You may now present evidence that is helpful in finding a contradiction in the testimony. To present evidence, answer the question with a JSON object in the format of {"action": "present", "testimony": <number of the testimony>, "evidence": <number of the evidence>}, for example {"action": "present", "testimony": 5, "evidence": 2}.
Note that the evidence, character, and testimony is listed from 0 to n-1, so your response should be 0-indexed.
Explain your reasoning step by step before providing the JSON object. 
 Conclude your answer with "Final Answer:" followed by the JSON object on a new line.
Do not write any things after the JSON and make sure you use "Final Answer:" followed by the JSON object.

Leads back to:
"Please state the name of the defendant in this case."Phoenix:
The defendant? Well, that's Larry Butz, Your Honor.Judge:
Correct. Just keep your wits about you and you'll do fine. Next question: This is a murder trial. Tell me, what's the victim's name?Phoenix:
(Whew, I know this one! Glad I read the case report cover to cover so many times. It's... wait... Uh-oh! No... no way! I forgot! I'm drawing a total blank here!)Mia:

"Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?"Cinder Block







Phoenix:
Oh, um, wasn't it Ms. Block? Ms. Cinder Block?
Judge:
The person in question was a victim of murder, not ill-conceived naming, Mr. Wright.

If you wish to hang yourself, Mr. Wright, you're welcome to, but not inside my courtroom. I suppose there's nothing to do but give you another try:
Leads back to:
"She died because she was...?"Phoenix:
She was struck once, by a blunt object.Judge:
Correct. You've answered all my questions. I see no reason why we shouldn't proceed. You seem much more relaxed, Mr. Wright. Good for you.Phoenix:
Thank you, Your Honor. (Because I don't FEEL relaxed, that's for sure.)Judge:
Well, then... First, a question for the prosecution. Mr. Payne?Payne:
Yes, Your Honor?Judge:
As Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to the court just what that "object" was?Payne:
The murder weapon was this statue of "The Thinker." It was found lying on the floor, next to the victim.Judge:
I see... The court accepts it into evidence. (Changed from [I see... the court accepts it into evidence.] in the original release)Statue added to the Court Record.Mia:

Pay attention. You don't want to miss any information that might help your client's case. You'll get your chance to respond to the prosecution later, so be ready! Let's just hope he doesn't say anything... unfortunate.Phoenix:
(Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... This could be bad.) (Changed from [Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... this could be bad.] in the original release)Payne:
Ahem. Mr. Butz. Is it not true that the victim had recently dumped you?Butz:
Hey, watch it buddy! We were great together! We were Romeo and Juliet, Cleopatra and Mark Anthony!Phoenix:
(Um... didn't they all die?)Butz:
I wasn't dumped! She just wasn't taking my phone calls. Or seeing me... Ever. WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?Payne:
Mr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by "dumped." In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!Butz:
Whaddya mean, "one of them"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!Payne:
Your Honor, the victim's passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.Passport added to the Court Record.Judge:
Hmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.Butz:
Dude... no way...Payne:
The victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several "Sugar Daddies."Butz:
Daddies? Sugar?Payne:
Yes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.Butz:
Duuude!Payne:
We can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?Mia:
Wright... I don't think you want him to answer that question.Phoenix:
(Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)Wait and see what happens







Phoenix:

Payne:
Well, Mr. Butz?
Butz:
Dude, no way! That cheatin' she-dog!

Phoenix:
My client had no idea the victim was seeing other men! That question is irrelevant to this case!

Oof! *wince*

Dude! Nick! Whaddya mean, "irrelevant"!? That cheatin' she-dog!
Leads to:
"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!"Butz:

Let's continue with the trial, shall we?Payne:
I believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.Judge:
Yes, quite.Phoenix:
(Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)Payne:
Next question! You went to the victim's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?Butz:
Gulp!Payne:
Well, did you, or did you not?Butz:
Heh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn't!Phoenix:
(Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)Have him answer honestly







Phoenix:
(I know! I'll send him a signal...)

(TELL THE TRUTH)

Butz:
Er... Yeah! Yeah! I was there! I went!
Judge:
Order! Well, Mr. Butz?
Butz:
Dude, chill! She wasn't home, man... So, like, I didn't see her.
Payne:

Payne:
Your Honor, the defendant is lying.
Judge:
Lying?
Payne:
The prosecution would like to call a witness who can prove Mr. Butz is lying.
Leads to:
"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"Stop him from answering







Phoenix:
(I'll send him a signal...)

(LIE LIKE A DOG)

Butz:
Um, well, see, it's like this: I don't remember.
Payne:
You "don't remember"? Well then, we'll just have to remind you!
Phoenix:
(I got a bad feeling about this...)
Payne:
We have a witness that can prove he DID go to the victim's apartment that day!
Leads to:
"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"Judge:
Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?Payne:
The man who found the victim's body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw the defendant fleeing the scene of the crime!Judge:
Order! Order in the court! Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.Payne:
Yes, Your Honor.Phoenix:
(This is bad...)Payne:
On the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim's building. Please bring Mr. Frank Sahwit to the stand!Payne:
Mr. Sahwit, you sell newspaper subscriptions, is this correct?Sahwit:
Oh, oh yes! Newspapers, yes!Judge:
Mr. Sahwit, you may proceed with your testimony. Please tell the court what you saw on the day of the murder.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Sahwit:
I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.
I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.
Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.
Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!
I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.
I thought to call the police immediately!
However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.
I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.
I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.
The man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Judge:
Hmm...Phoenix:
(Larry! Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!)Judge:
Incidentally, why wasn't the phone in the victim's apartment working?Payne:
Your Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.Judge:
Aren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?Payne:
Yes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.Blackout Record added to the Court Record.Judge:
Now, Mr. Wright...Phoenix:
Yes! Er... yes, Your Honor?Judge:
You may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:
C-Cross-examination, Your Honor?Mia:
Alright, Wright, this is it. The real deal!Phoenix:
Uh... what exactly am I supposed to do?Mia:
Why, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!Phoenix:
Lies! What?! He was lying!?Mia:
Your client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?Phoenix:
!!! How do I prove he's not?Mia:
You hold the key! It's in the evidence! Compare the witness's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there! First, find contradictions between the Court Record and the witness's testimony. Then, once you've found the contradicting evidence... present it and rub it in the witness's face!Phoenix:
Um... okay.Mia:
Open the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab], then point out contradictions in the testimony! (Changed from [Touch the Court Record button and point out contradictions in the testimony!] in the original release)Cross Examination

2025-01-22 14:11:14,462 - INFO - Assistant reply: To find contradictions in Frank Sahwit's testimony, we must carefully align his statements with the available evidence. Let's break down the testimony and compare it with the evidence provided to identify any inconsistencies.

### Frank Sahwit’s Testimony:
- **Statement 8**: "I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM." 

### Available Evidence:
- **Cindy's Autopsy Report**: The time of death was between 4 PM and 5 PM.

### Analysis:
- Frank Sahwit claims he remembers the time specifically as 1:00 PM when he made the crucial observations. However, the autopsy report indicates Cindy Stone could not have been dead at that time because her death occurred between 4 PM and 5 PM. 

This discrepancy suggests that if Sahwit truly saw the body at 1:00 PM, she wouldn't have been dead yet, as the time frame given by the autopsy hadn't begun. This inconsistency calls into question the accuracy of his testimony.

### Conclusion:
The contradiction lies between the time Sahwit remembers (1:00 PM) and the autopsy report’s official time of death (4 PM-5 PM). We present the autopsy report as evidence to counter Sahwit's testimony about the time.

### Final Answer:

Our school had a saying: \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\" In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one.

Dammit! ...Why me? I can't get caught... Not like this! I-I've gotta find someone to pin this on... Someone like... him! I'll make it look like HE did it!August 3, 9:47 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2Phoenix:
(Boy am I nervous!)Mia:
Wright!Phoenix:
Oh, h-hiya, Chief.Mia:
Whew, I'm glad I made it on time. Well, I have to say Phoenix, I'm impressed! Not everyone takes on a murder trial right off the bat like this. It says a lot about you... and your client as well.Phoenix:
Um... thanks. Actually, it's because I owe him a favor.Mia:
A favor? You mean, you knew the defendant before this case?Phoenix:
Yes. Actually, I kind of owe my current job to him. He's one of the reasons I became an attorney.Mia:
Well, that's news to me!Phoenix:
I want to help him out any way I can! I just... really want to help him. I owe him that much.???:
(It's over! My life, everything, it's all over!)Mia:
... Is that your client screaming over there? (Changed from [Isn't that your client screaming over there?] in the original release)Phoenix:
Yeah... it's him. (Changed from [Yeah... that's him.] in the original release)???:
(Death! Despair! Ohhhh! I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna die!!!)Mia:
It sounds like he wants to die...Phoenix:
Um, yeah. *sigh*Butz:
Nick!!!Phoenix:
Hey. Hey there, Larry.Butz:
Dude, I'm so guilty!! Tell them I'm guilty!!! Gimme the death sentence! I ain't afraid to die!Phoenix:
What!? What's wrong, Larry?Butz:
Oh, it's all over... I... I'm finished. Finished! I can't live in a world without her! I can't! Who... who took her away from me, Nick? Who did this!? Aww, Nick, ya gotta tell me! Who took my baby away!?Phoenix:
(Hmm... The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say it was you...)Phoenix:
My name is Phoenix Wright. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: "When something smells, it's usually the Butz." In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!August 3, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz. (Changed from [The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.] in the original release)Payne:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The, um, defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:
Ahem. Mr. Wright? This is your first trial, is it not?Phoenix:
Y-Yes, Your Honor. I'm, um, a little nervous.Judge:
Your conduct during this trial will decide the fate of your client. Murder is a serious charge. For your client's sake, I hope you can control your nerves.Phoenix:
Thank... thank you, Your Honor.Judge:
... Mr. Wright, given the circumstances... I think we should have a test to ascertain your readiness.Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. (Gulp... Hands shaking... Eyesight... fading...)Judge:
This test will consist of a few simple questions. Answer them clearly and concisely. Please state the name of the defendant in this case.Phoenix Wright







Phoenix:
Um... the defendant... is me... right? (Changed from [Um... the defendant... is me, right?] in the original release)
Mia:
Wright! Have you completely lost your mind? Focus! The defendant is the person on trial! You're his lawyer!
Phoenix:
Um, er, eh? Oh yeah, right! Eh heh heh.
Mia:
This is no laughing matter! You did pass the bar, didn't you?
Judge:
Sorry, I couldn't hear your answer. I'll ask once more:
Leads back to:
"Please state the name of the defendant in this case."Larry Butz







Leads to:
"The defendant? Well, that's Larry Butz, Your Honor."Mia Fey







Phoenix:
The, um, defendant? That's... er... Mia Fey?
Mia:
Wrong, Wright. Look, I have to leave. I have to go home. I'm... I'm expecting a delivery.
Phoenix:
Aw, c'mon Chief. There's no need to be going so soon, is there?
Mia:
Listen, Wright! (Changed from [Wright!] in the original release) The defendant is the one on trial--your client! (Changed from [Listen: the defendant is the one on trial--your client!] in the original release) I mean, that's about as basic as you can get!
Phoenix:
(I've put my foot in it this time! I've got to relax!)
Judge:
Sorry, I couldn't hear your answer. I'll ask once more:
Leads back to:
"Please state the name of the defendant in this case."Phoenix:
The defendant? Well, that's Larry Butz, Your Honor.Judge:
Correct. Just keep your wits about you and you'll do fine. Next question: This is a murder trial. Tell me, what's the victim's name?Phoenix:
(Whew, I know this one! Glad I read the case report cover to cover so many times. It's... wait... Uh-oh! No... no way! I forgot! I'm drawing a total blank here!)Mia:
Phoenix! Are you absolutely SURE you're up to this? You don't even know the victim's name!?Phoenix:
Oh, the victim! O-Of course I know the victim's name! I, um, just forgot. ...Temporarily (Changed from [I, um, just forgot. ... Temporarily.] in the original release)Mia:
I think I feel a migraine coming on. Look, the victim's name is listed in the Court Record. Just press [the R Button / Tab] to check it at any time, okay? (Changed from [Just touch the Court Record button to check it at any time, okay?] in the original release) Remember to check it often. Do it for me, please. I'm begging you.Judge:
Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?Mia Fey







Phoenix:
Um... Mia Fey?
Mia:
W-W-What!? How can I be the victim!?
Phoenix:
Oh! Right! Sorry! I, er, it was the first name that popped into my head, and--
Mia:
The Court Record button! Remember to use it when you're in a pinch with [the R Button / Tab]. (Changed from [Remember to use it when you're in a pinch.] in the original release)
Judge:
Let me ask that one again:
Leads back to:
"Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?"Cinder Block







Phoenix:
Oh, um, wasn't it Ms. Block? Ms. Cinder Block?
Judge:
The person in question was a victim of murder, not ill-conceived naming, Mr. Wright.
Mia:
Wright? If you forget something, use [the R Button / Tab] to check the Court Record and jog your memory. (Changed from [If you forget something, [just touch the Court Record button to help you remember.] in the original release) A mistake in court could cost you the case.
Judge:
I'll ask you again:
Leads back to:
"Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?"Cindy Stone







Leads to:
"Um... the victim's name is Cindy Stone."Phoenix:
Um... the victim's name is Cindy Stone.Judge:
Correct. Now, tell me, what was the cause of death? She died because she was...?Poisoned







Phoenix:
Oh, right! Wasn't she, um, poisoned by er... poison?
Judge:
You're asking me!?
Phoenix:
Um... Chief! Help me out!
Mia:
Check the court record. [The R Button / Tab]... remember? (Changed from [Check the court record. The Court Record button... remember?] in the original release)
Phoenix:
(Geez. Give a guy a break!)
Judge:
Let me ask again.
Leads back to:
"She died because she was...?"Hit with a blunt object







Leads to:
"She was struck once, by a blunt object."Strangled







Phoenix:
Right... she was strangled, wasn't she?
Mia:
Please tell me that was you talking to yourself.
Judge:
If you wish to hang yourself, Mr. Wright, you're welcome to, but not inside my courtroom. I suppose there's nothing to do but give you another try:
Leads back to:
"She died because she was...?"Phoenix:
She was struck once, by a blunt object.Judge:
Correct. You've answered all my questions. I see no reason why we shouldn't proceed. You seem much more relaxed, Mr. Wright. Good for you.Phoenix:
Thank you, Your Honor. (Because I don't FEEL relaxed, that's for sure.)Judge:
Well, then... First, a question for the prosecution. Mr. Payne?Payne:
Yes, Your Honor?Judge:
As Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to the court just what that "object" was?Payne:
The murder weapon was this statue of "The Thinker." It was found lying on the floor, next to the victim.Judge:
I see... The court accepts it into evidence. (Changed from [I see... the court accepts it into evidence.] in the original release)Statue added to the Court Record.Mia:
Wright... Be sure to pay attention to any evidence added during the trial. That evidence is the only ammunition you have in court. [Touch the Court Record button / Use the R Button] to check the Court Record frequently.Judge:
Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its first witness.Payne:
The prosecution calls the defendant, Mr. Butz, to the stand.Phoenix:
Um, Chief, what do I do now?Mia:
Pay attention. You don't want to miss any information that might help your client's case. You'll get your chance to respond to the prosecution later, so be ready! Let's just hope he doesn't say anything... unfortunate.Phoenix:
(Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... This could be bad.) (Changed from [Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... this could be bad.] in the original release)Payne:
Ahem. Mr. Butz. Is it not true that the victim had recently dumped you?Butz:
Hey, watch it buddy! We were great together! We were Romeo and Juliet, Cleopatra and Mark Anthony!Phoenix:
(Um... didn't they all die?)Butz:
I wasn't dumped! She just wasn't taking my phone calls. Or seeing me... Ever. WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?Payne:
Mr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by "dumped." In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!Butz:
Whaddya mean, "one of them"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!Payne:
Your Honor, the victim's passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.Passport added to the Court Record.Judge:
Hmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.Butz:
Dude... no way...Payne:
The victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several "Sugar Daddies."Butz:
Daddies? Sugar?Payne:
Yes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.Butz:
Duuude!Payne:
We can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?Mia:
Wright... I don't think you want him to answer that question.Phoenix:
(Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)Wait and see what happens







Phoenix:
(Might be better not to get involved in this one...)
Payne:
Well, Mr. Butz?
Butz:
Dude, no way! That cheatin' she-dog!
Leads to:
"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!"Stop him from answering







Phoenix:
My client had no idea the victim was seeing other men! That question is irrelevant to this case!
Payne:
Oof! *wince*
Butz:
Dude! Nick! Whaddya mean, "irrelevant"!? That cheatin' she-dog!
Leads to:
"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!"Butz:
I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I'm going to get to the bottom of this!Judge:
Let's continue with the trial, shall we?Payne:
I believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.Judge:
Yes, quite.Phoenix:
(Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)Payne:
Next question! You went to the victim's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?Butz:
Gulp!Payne:
Well, did you, or did you not?Butz:
Heh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn't!Phoenix:
(Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)Have him answer honestly







Phoenix:
(I know! I'll send him a signal...)

(TELL THE TRUTH)

Butz:
Er... Yeah! Yeah! I was there! I went!
Judge:
Order! Well, Mr. Butz?
Butz:
Dude, chill! She wasn't home, man... So, like, I didn't see her.
Payne:

Payne:
Your Honor, the defendant is lying.
Judge:
Lying?
Payne:
The prosecution would like to call a witness who can prove Mr. Butz is lying.
Leads to:
"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"Stop him from answering







Phoenix:
(I'll send him a signal...)

(LIE LIKE A DOG)

Butz:
Um, well, see, it's like this: I don't remember.
Payne:
You "don't remember"? Well then, we'll just have to remind you!
Phoenix:
(I got a bad feeling about this...)
Payne:
We have a witness that can prove he DID go to the victim's apartment that day!
Leads to:
"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"Judge:
Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?Payne:
The man who found the victim's body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw the defendant fleeing the scene of the crime!Judge:
Order! Order in the court! Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.Payne:
Yes, Your Honor.Phoenix:
(This is bad...)Payne:
On the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim's building. Please bring Mr. Frank Sahwit to the stand!Payne:
Mr. Sahwit, you sell newspaper subscriptions, is this correct?Sahwit:
Oh, oh yes! Newspapers, yes!Judge:
Mr. Sahwit, you may proceed with your testimony. Please tell the court what you saw on the day of the murder.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Sahwit:
I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.
I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.
Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.
Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!
I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.
I thought to call the police immediately!
However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.
I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.
I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.
The man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Judge:
Hmm...Phoenix:
(Larry! Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!)Judge:
Incidentally, why wasn't the phone in the victim's apartment working?Payne:
Your Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.Judge:
Aren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?Payne:
Yes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.Blackout Record added to the Court Record.Judge:

Yes! Er... yes, Your Honor?Judge:
You may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:
C-Cross-examination, Your Honor?Mia:
Alright, Wright, this is it. The real deal!Phoenix:
Uh... what exactly am I supposed to do?Mia:
Why, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!Phoenix:
Lies! What?! He was lying!?Mia:
Your client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Isn't a man leaving an apartment a common sight? I find it odd you would take notice of him...
Sahwit:
Er... heh. I don't know. He just seemed strange to me, that's all. Like he was mad, and yet frightened at the same time. Just like... a criminal fleeing the scene of a crime!
Phoenix:
The defense requests that the witness refrain from conjecture!
Payne:
Of course. What the witness means is that the man he saw looked suspicious. So, what happened next?Sahwit:
I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Half-open... you say?
Sahwit:
Yes, yes, the door was open halfway. Yes. I watched for a moment, but no one came to close the door. "That's odd, in a big city like this," I thought...
Payne:
I see. And what happened next?Sahwit:
Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What gave you the idea to do that?
Sahwit:
Well, the door was half-open, you see. Isn't it only human to want to... peek? We climb mountains because they are there! It's the same thing.
Payne:
Truer words have never been spoken! Anyone would look inside!

Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Are you sure she was dead?
Sahwit:
W-Well, no, I guess I wasn't. But, she wasn't moving at all, and there was blood everywhere.
Phoenix:

I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So, you didn't touch ANYTHING in the apartment?
Sahwit:
Um, yes. I mean no! Nothing.

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
You "thought" to call the police? Does that mean you didn't actually call them!?

Sahwit:
Yes. I mean, no. No, it wasn't. Right. (Changed from [Yes. I mean, no, no it wasn't. Right.] in the original release)
Phoenix:
But you said you didn't go into the apartment... or did you!?
Sahwit:
Oh, oh, that? I can explain that! There was a cordless phone on a shelf in the entranceway. I reached inside and tried using that to call...
Payne:
And the phone wasn't working, correct? What happened next?Sahwit:
I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Why use a public phone?
Sahwit:
Well, you see, I don't have a cell phone. And, being the middle of the afternoon, there was no answer at the nearby apartments.

Phoenix:
1:00 PM! Are you certain?

That's all of it. There must be a contradiction in there somewhere. Examine the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab] if something strikes you as being suspicious. (Changed from [Examine the Court Record button if something strikes you as being suspicious.] in the original release) Then, find the evidence that contradicts his testimony, and present it to the court!Phoenix:
You found the body at 1:00 PM. You're sure?Sahwit:
Yes. It was 1:00 PM, for certain.Phoenix:
Frankly, I find that hard to believe! Your statement directly contradicts the autopsy report. The autopsy notes the time of death at sometime after 4PM. There was nobody to... er... no "body" to find at 1:00 PM! How do you explain this three-hour gap?Sahwit:
!!! Oh, that! Oh, er...Payne:Payne:
This is trivial! The witness merely forgot the time!Judge:
After his testimony, I find that hard to believe. Mr. Sahwit... Why were you so certain that you found the body at 1:00 PM?Sahwit:
I... er... well, I... Gee, that's a really good question!Mia:
Great job, Wright! Way to put him on the spot! That's all you have to do: point out contradictions! Lies always beget more lies! See through one, and their whole story falls apart!Sahwit:
Wait! I remember now!Judge:
Would you care to give your testimony again?Witness Testimony-- The Time of Discovery --Sahwit:
You see, when I found the body, I heard the time.
There was a voice saying the time... It was probably coming from the television.
Oh, but it was three hours off, wasn't it?
I guess the victim must have been watching a video of a taped program!
That's why I thought it was 1:00 PM!
Terribly sorry about the misunderstanding...Judge:
Hmm... I see. You heard a voice saying the time on a taped program. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Mia:
Wright! You know what to do!Phoenix:
I've got this one.Cross Examination

2025-01-22 14:11:30,833 - INFO - Assistant reply: To uncover the contradiction in Frank Sahwit's testimony, we need to compare the evidence with his statements.

From the beginning, Sahwit mentions that when he found the body, he heard a voice announcing the time, which he assumed came from a television. He further elaborates that the time he heard was three hours off, implying that the victim was likely watching a pre-recorded television program.

However, one of the key items of evidence is the Blackout Record. It notes that the electricity in Ms. Stone's building was out from noon to 6 PM on the day of the crime. If the electricity was indeed out during that time, it would have been impossible for the television to be on, thereby negating Sahwit's claim of hearing the time from there.

We need to present this contradiction. Sahwit specifically claims during testimony 1 that he heard the time when he "found the body," thinking it came from the television. The Blackout Record, evidence 4, directly contradicts the possibility of a television being operational during the time of the blackout.

The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say it was you...)Phoenix:\nMy name is Phoenix Wright. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\" In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!August 3, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.

In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!August 3, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz. (Changed from [The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.] in the original release)Payne:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The, um, defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:
Ahem. Mr. Wright? This is your first trial, is it not?Phoenix:
Y-Yes, Your Honor. I'm, um, a little nervous.Judge:
Your conduct during this trial will decide the fate of your client. Murder is a serious charge. For your client's sake, I hope you can control your nerves.Phoenix:
Thank... thank you, Your Honor.Judge:
... Mr. Wright, given the circumstances... I think we should have a test to ascertain your readiness.Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. (Gulp... Hands shaking... Eyesight... fading...)Judge:
This test will consist of a few simple questions. Answer them clearly and concisely. Please state the name of the defendant in this case.Phoenix Wright







Phoenix:
Um... the defendant... is me... right? (Changed from [Um... the defendant... is me, right?] in the original release)
Mia:
Wright! Have you completely lost your mind? Focus! The defendant is the person on trial! You're his lawyer!
Phoenix:
Um, er, eh? Oh yeah, right! Eh heh heh.
Mia:
This is no laughing matter! You did pass the bar, didn't you?
Judge:
Sorry, I couldn't hear your answer. I'll ask once more:
Leads back to:
"Please state the name of the defendant in this case."Larry Butz







Leads to:
"The defendant? Well, that's Larry Butz, Your Honor."Mia Fey







Phoenix:
The, um, defendant? That's... er... Mia Fey?
Mia:
Wrong, Wright. Look, I have to leave. I have to go home. I'm... I'm expecting a delivery.
Phoenix:
Aw, c'mon Chief. There's no need to be going so soon, is there?
Mia:
Listen, Wright! (Changed from [Wright!] in the original release) The defendant is the one on trial--your client! (Changed from [Listen: the defendant is the one on trial--your client!] in the original release) I mean, that's about as basic as you can get!
Phoenix:
(I've put my foot in it this time! I've got to relax!)
Judge:
Sorry, I couldn't hear your answer. I'll ask once more:
Leads back to:
"Please state the name of the defendant in this case."Phoenix:
The defendant? Well, that's Larry Butz, Your Honor.Judge:
Correct. Just keep your wits about you and you'll do fine. Next question: This is a murder trial. Tell me, what's the victim's name?Phoenix:
(Whew, I know this one! Glad I read the case report cover to cover so many times. It's... wait... Uh-oh! No... no way! I forgot! I'm drawing a total blank here!)Mia:
Phoenix! Are you absolutely SURE you're up to this? You don't even know the victim's name!?Phoenix:
Oh, the victim! O-Of course I know the victim's name! I, um, just forgot. ...Temporarily (Changed from [I, um, just forgot. ... Temporarily.] in the original release)Mia:
I think I feel a migraine coming on. Look, the victim's name is listed in the Court Record. Just press [the R Button / Tab] to check it at any time, okay? (Changed from [Just touch the Court Record button to check it at any time, okay?] in the original release) Remember to check it often. Do it for me, please. I'm begging you.Judge:
Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?Mia Fey







Phoenix:
Um... Mia Fey?
Mia:
W-W-What!? How can I be the victim!?
Phoenix:
Oh! Right! Sorry! I, er, it was the first name that popped into my head, and--
Mia:
The Court Record button! Remember to use it when you're in a pinch with [the R Button / Tab]. (Changed from [Remember to use it when you're in a pinch.] in the original release)
Judge:
Let me ask that one again:
Leads back to:
"Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?"Cinder Block







Phoenix:
Oh, um, wasn't it Ms. Block? Ms. Cinder Block?
Judge:
The person in question was a victim of murder, not ill-conceived naming, Mr. Wright.
Mia:
Wright? If you forget something, use [the R Button / Tab] to check the Court Record and jog your memory. (Changed from [If you forget something, [just touch the Court Record button to help you remember.] in the original release) A mistake in court could cost you the case.
Judge:
I'll ask you again:
Leads back to:
"Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?"Cindy Stone







Leads to:
"Um... the victim's name is Cindy Stone."Phoenix:
Um... the victim's name is Cindy Stone.Judge:
Correct. Now, tell me, what was the cause of death? She died because she was...?Poisoned







Phoenix:
Oh, right! Wasn't she, um, poisoned by er... poison?
Judge:
You're asking me!?
Phoenix:
Um... Chief! Help me out!
Mia:
Check the court record. [The R Button / Tab]... remember? (Changed from [Check the court record. The Court Record button... remember?] in the original release)
Phoenix:
(Geez. Give a guy a break!)
Judge:
Let me ask again.
Leads back to:
"She died because she was...?"Hit with a blunt object







Leads to:
"She was struck once, by a blunt object."Strangled







Phoenix:
Right... she was strangled, wasn't she?
Mia:
Please tell me that was you talking to yourself.
Judge:
If you wish to hang yourself, Mr. Wright, you're welcome to, but not inside my courtroom. I suppose there's nothing to do but give you another try:
Leads back to:
"She died because she was...?"Phoenix:
She was struck once, by a blunt object.Judge:
Correct. You've answered all my questions. I see no reason why we shouldn't proceed. You seem much more relaxed, Mr. Wright. Good for you.Phoenix:
Thank you, Your Honor. (Because I don't FEEL relaxed, that's for sure.)Judge:
Well, then... First, a question for the prosecution. Mr. Payne?Payne:
Yes, Your Honor?Judge:
As Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to the court just what that "object" was?Payne:
The murder weapon was this statue of "The Thinker." It was found lying on the floor, next to the victim.Judge:
I see... The court accepts it into evidence. (Changed from [I see... the court accepts it into evidence.] in the original release)Statue added to the Court Record.Mia:
Wright... Be sure to pay attention to any evidence added during the trial. That evidence is the only ammunition you have in court. [Touch the Court Record button / Use the R Button] to check the Court Record frequently.Judge:
Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its first witness.Payne:
The prosecution calls the defendant, Mr. Butz, to the stand.Phoenix:
Um, Chief, what do I do now?Mia:
Pay attention. You don't want to miss any information that might help your client's case. You'll get your chance to respond to the prosecution later, so be ready! Let's just hope he doesn't say anything... unfortunate.Phoenix:
(Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... This could be bad.) (Changed from [Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... this could be bad.] in the original release)Payne:
Ahem. Mr. Butz. Is it not true that the victim had recently dumped you?Butz:
Hey, watch it buddy! We were great together! We were Romeo and Juliet, Cleopatra and Mark Anthony!Phoenix:
(Um... didn't they all die?)Butz:
I wasn't dumped! She just wasn't taking my phone calls. Or seeing me... Ever. WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?Payne:
Mr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by "dumped." In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!Butz:
Whaddya mean, "one of them"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!Payne:
Your Honor, the victim's passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.Passport added to the Court Record.Judge:
Hmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.Butz:
Dude... no way...Payne:
The victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several "Sugar Daddies."Butz:
Daddies? Sugar?Payne:
Yes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.Butz:
Duuude!Payne:
We can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?Mia:
Wright... I don't think you want him to answer that question.Phoenix:
(Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)Wait and see what happens







Phoenix:
(Might be better not to get involved in this one...)
Payne:
Well, Mr. Butz?
Butz:
Dude, no way! That cheatin' she-dog!
Leads to:
"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!"Stop him from answering







Phoenix:
My client had no idea the victim was seeing other men! That question is irrelevant to this case!
Payne:
Oof! *wince*
Butz:
Dude! Nick! Whaddya mean, "irrelevant"!? That cheatin' she-dog!
Leads to:
"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!"Butz:
I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I'm going to get to the bottom of this!Judge:
Let's continue with the trial, shall we?Payne:
I believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.Judge:
Yes, quite.Phoenix:
(Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)Payne:
Next question! You went to the victim's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?Butz:
Gulp!Payne:
Well, did you, or did you not?Butz:
Heh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn't!Phoenix:
(Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)Have him answer honestly







Phoenix:
(I know! I'll send him a signal...)

(TELL THE TRUTH)

Butz:
Er... Yeah! Yeah! I was there! I went!
Judge:
Order! Well, Mr. Butz?
Butz:
Dude, chill! She wasn't home, man... So, like, I didn't see her.
Payne:

Payne:
Your Honor, the defendant is lying.
Judge:
Lying?
Payne:
The prosecution would like to call a witness who can prove Mr. Butz is lying.
Leads to:
"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"Stop him from answering







Phoenix:
(I'll send him a signal...)

(LIE LIKE A DOG)

Butz:
Um, well, see, it's like this: I don't remember.
Payne:
You "don't remember"? Well then, we'll just have to remind you!
Phoenix:
(I got a bad feeling about this...)
Payne:
We have a witness that can prove he DID go to the victim's apartment that day!
Leads to:
"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"Judge:
Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?Payne:
The man who found the victim's body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw the defendant fleeing the scene of the crime!Judge:
Order! Order in the court! Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.Payne:
Yes, Your Honor.Phoenix:
(This is bad...)Payne:
On the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim's building. Please bring Mr. Frank Sahwit to the stand!Payne:
Mr. Sahwit, you sell newspaper subscriptions, is this correct?Sahwit:
Oh, oh yes! Newspapers, yes!Judge:
Mr. Sahwit, you may proceed with your testimony. Please tell the court what you saw on the day of the murder.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Sahwit:
I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.
I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.
Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.
Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!
I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.
I thought to call the police immediately!
However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.
I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.
I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.
The man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Judge:
Hmm...Phoenix:
(Larry! Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!)Judge:
Incidentally, why wasn't the phone in the victim's apartment working?Payne:
Your Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.Judge:
Aren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?Payne:
Yes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.Blackout Record added to the Court Record.Judge:
Now, Mr. Wright...Phoenix:
Yes! Er... yes, Your Honor?Judge:
You may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:
C-Cross-examination, Your Honor?Mia:
Alright, Wright, this is it. The real deal!Phoenix:
Uh... what exactly am I supposed to do?Mia:
Why, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!Phoenix:
Lies! What?! He was lying!?Mia:
Your client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?Phoenix:
!!! How do I prove he's not?Mia:
You hold the key! It's in the evidence! Compare the witness's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there! First, find contradictions between the Court Record and the witness's testimony. Then, once you've found the contradicting evidence... present it and rub it in the witness's face!Phoenix:
Um... okay.Mia:
Open the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab], then point out contradictions in the testimony! (Changed from [Touch the Court Record button and point out contradictions in the testimony!] in the original release)Cross Examination-- Witness's Account --Sahwit:
I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Isn't a man leaving an apartment a common sight? I find it odd you would take notice of him...
Sahwit:
Er... heh. I don't know. He just seemed strange to me, that's all. Like he was mad, and yet frightened at the same time. Just like... a criminal fleeing the scene of a crime!
Phoenix:
The defense requests that the witness refrain from conjecture!
Payne:
Of course. What the witness means is that the man he saw looked suspicious. So, what happened next?Sahwit:
I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Half-open... you say?
Sahwit:
Yes, yes, the door was open halfway. Yes. I watched for a moment, but no one came to close the door. "That's odd, in a big city like this," I thought...
Payne:
I see. And what happened next?Sahwit:
Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What gave you the idea to do that?
Sahwit:
Well, the door was half-open, you see. Isn't it only human to want to... peek? We climb mountains because they are there! It's the same thing.
Payne:
Truer words have never been spoken! Anyone would look inside!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... why did Payne cut him off so quickly?)
Payne:
So you looked into the apartment. What happened then?Sahwit:
Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Are you sure she was dead?
Sahwit:
W-Well, no, I guess I wasn't. But, she wasn't moving at all, and there was blood everywhere.
Phoenix:
(I guess that would look fatal to anyone...) Very well, what happened next?Sahwit:
I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So, you didn't touch ANYTHING in the apartment?
Sahwit:
Um, yes. I mean no! Nothing.
Phoenix:
Okay. What happened next?Sahwit:
I thought to call the police immediately!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
You "thought" to call the police? Does that mean you didn't actually call them!?
Payne:
Please, please... Listen to the rest of the testimony. You thought to call the police... What happened next?Sahwit:
However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
The phone in her apartment wasn't working?
Sahwit:
Yes. I mean, no. No, it wasn't. Right. (Changed from [Yes. I mean, no, no it wasn't. Right.] in the original release)
Phoenix:
But you said you didn't go into the apartment... or did you!?
Sahwit:
Oh, oh, that? I can explain that! There was a cordless phone on a shelf in the entranceway. I reached inside and tried using that to call...
Payne:
And the phone wasn't working, correct? What happened next?Sahwit:
I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Why use a public phone?
Sahwit:
Well, you see, I don't have a cell phone. And, being the middle of the afternoon, there was no answer at the nearby apartments.
Phoenix:
Ah, right... what time did you call again?Sahwit:
I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
1:00 PM! Are you certain?
Sahwit:
Yes. Absolutely.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... He seems really confident.)
Mia:
1:00 PM? Wright. Doesn't that seem strange to you? Present some evidence to contradict him!Present Cindy's Autopsy Report







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"You found the body at 1:00 PM. You're sure?"Sahwit:
The man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Are you absolutely, 100% positive?
Sahwit:
Yes, it was him. No mistake about it.
Payne:
The witness says he's certain!Mia:
That's all of it. There must be a contradiction in there somewhere. Examine the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab] if something strikes you as being suspicious. (Changed from [Examine the Court Record button if something strikes you as being suspicious.] in the original release) Then, find the evidence that contradicts his testimony, and present it to the court!Phoenix:
You found the body at 1:00 PM. You're sure?Sahwit:
Yes. It was 1:00 PM, for certain.Phoenix:
Frankly, I find that hard to believe! Your statement directly contradicts the autopsy report. The autopsy notes the time of death at sometime after 4PM. There was nobody to... er... no "body" to find at 1:00 PM! How do you explain this three-hour gap?Sahwit:
!!! Oh, that! Oh, er...Payne:Payne:
This is trivial! The witness merely forgot the time!Judge:
After his testimony, I find that hard to believe. Mr. Sahwit... Why were you so certain that you found the body at 1:00 PM?Sahwit:
I... er... well, I... Gee, that's a really good question!Mia:
Great job, Wright! Way to put him on the spot! That's all you have to do: point out contradictions! Lies always beget more lies! See through one, and their whole story falls apart!Sahwit:
Wait! I remember now!Judge:
Would you care to give your testimony again?Witness Testimony-- The Time of Discovery --Sahwit:
You see, when I found the body, I heard the time.
There was a voice saying the time... It was probably coming from the television.
Oh, but it was three hours off, wasn't it?
I guess the victim must have been watching a video of a taped program!
That's why I thought it was 1:00 PM!
Terribly sorry about the misunderstanding...Judge:
Hmm... I see. You heard a voice saying the time on a taped program. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Mia:
Wright! You know what to do!Phoenix:
I've got this one.Cross Examination-- The Time of Discovery --Sahwit:
You see, when I found the body, I heard the time.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
You said "heard"... Not "saw"?
Sahwit:
Yes, heard. All I saw was the body lying there... I didn't think to look at anything else, least of all my watch.
Phoenix:
Hmm... Isn't that a little strange? So you're saying you "heard" something. But if you were so shocked by the body, you wouldn't hear anything at all!
Payne:

Payne:
The witness did say he actually heard the time. It's ludicrous to suggest he "wouldn't hear anything"!
Judge:
Hmm... I have to agree with the prosecution. Witness, continue your testimony.Present Blackout Record







Phoenix:

"Hold it right there!"Sahwit:
There was a voice saying the time... It was probably coming from the television.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Are you sure it was a television and not... a radio?
Sahwit:
Well, no, I guess it might have been a radio.
Payne:
Incidentally, there was no radio on the premises. There was only one large television.
Mia:
Wright! I can't put my finger on it, but something about this seems fishy. Something about "hearing" the television...
Payne:

You couldn't have heard a television... or a video!Sahwit:
Gah!!! I... well... urk!Judge:
The defense has a point. Do you have an explanation for this, Mr. Sahwit?Sahwit:
No, I... I find it quite puzzling myself! Quite! ... Aah! W-wait! I remember now!Judge:
Mr. Sahwit? The court would prefer to hear an accurate testimony from the very beginning. These constant corrections are harming your credibility. That, and you seem rather... distraught.Sahwit:
...! M-my apologies, Your Honor! It... er, it must have been the shock of finding the body!Judge:
Very well, Mr. Sahwit. Let's hear your testimony once more please.Witness Testimony-- Hearing the Time --Sahwit:
Actually, I didn't "hear" the time... I "saw" it!
There was a table clock in the apartment, wasn't there!
Yeah, the murder weapon! The killer used it to hit the victim!
That must have been what I saw.Judge:
You saw a clock? I guess that would explain it. The defense may cross-examine the witness.Phoenix:

2025-01-22 14:11:38,884 - INFO - Assistant reply: To find the contradiction in the testimony, let's analyze the new testimony by Frank Sahwit:

**Testimony Analysis:**
1. **Sahwit:** "Actually, I didn't 'hear' the time... I 'saw' it!"
   - **Observation:** Sahwit changes his statement, claiming he saw the time instead of hearing it.

2. **Sahwit:** "There was a table clock in the apartment, wasn't there!"
   - **Observation:** He now claims a table clock was present, allowing him to see the time.

3. **Sahwit:** "Yeah, the murder weapon! The killer used it to hit the victim!"
   - **Observation:** He refers to the murder weapon as a clock, which conflicts with the evidence list because the murder weapon is a statue in the shape of "The Thinker."

4. **Sahwit:** "That must have been what I saw."
   - **Observation:** He insists what he saw was what allowed him to determine the time.

**Evidence Examination:**
- **Statue:** A statue in the shape of "The Thinker." It's rather heavy. Listed as the murder weapon and nowhere mentioned as having a clock function, contradicts Sahwit's testimony.

**Conclusion:**
- The contradiction lies in Sahwit’s claim that the murder weapon was a clock. The evidence shows that the murder weapon was a heavy statue shaped like "The Thinker." There is no indication in the evidence that this item functions as a clock. The testimony stating the murder weapon was a clock should be disputed using the evidence of the statue.

Therefore, the correct action is to present the statue evidence against the testimony point where Sahwit claims the murder weapon was a clock.

**Final Answer:**

I'll make it look like HE did it!August 3, 9:47 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2Phoenix:\n(Boy am I nervous!)Mia:\nWright!Phoenix:\nOh, h-hiya, Chief.Mia:\nWhew, I'm glad I made it on time. Well, I have to say Phoenix, I'm impressed! Not everyone takes on a murder trial right off the bat like this. It says a lot about you... and your client as well.Phoenix:\nUm... thanks. Actually, it's because I owe him a favor.Mia:\nA favor? You mean, you knew the defendant before this case?Phoenix:\nYes. Actually, I kind of owe my current job to him. He's one of the reasons I became an attorney.Mia:\nWell, that's news to me!Phoenix:\nI want to help him out any way I can! I just... really want to help him. I owe him that much.???:\n(It's over! My life, everything, it's all over!)Mia:\n... Is that your client screaming over there? (Changed from [Isn't that your client screaming over there?] in the original release)Phoenix:\nYeah... it's him. (Changed from [Yeah... that's him.] in the original release)???:\n(Death! Despair!

I can't live in a world without her! I can't! Who... who took her away from me, Nick? Who did this!? Aww, Nick, ya gotta tell me! Who took my baby away!?Phoenix:\n(Hmm... The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say it was you...)Phoenix:\nMy name is Phoenix Wright. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\" In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!August 3, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz. (Changed from [The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.] in the original release)Payne:\nThe prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:\nThe, um, defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:\nAhem.

Murder is a serious charge. For your client's sake, I hope you can control your nerves.Phoenix:\nThank... thank you, Your Honor.Judge:\n... Mr. Wright, given the circumstances... I think we should have a test to ascertain your readiness.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. (Gulp... Hands shaking... Eyesight... fading...)Judge:\nThis test will consist of a few simple questions. Answer them clearly and concisely. Please state the name of the defendant in this case.Phoenix Wright\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... the defendant... is me... right? (Changed from [Um... the defendant... is me, right?] in the original release)\nMia:\nWright! Have you completely lost your mind? Focus! The defendant is the person on trial! You're his lawyer!\nPhoenix:\nUm, er, eh? Oh yeah, right! Eh heh heh.\nMia:\nThis is no laughing matter! You did pass the bar, didn't you?\nJudge:\nSorry, I couldn't hear your answer. I'll ask once more:\nLeads back to:\n\"Please state the name of the defendant in this case.\"Larry Butz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"The defendant?

I'm expecting a delivery.\nPhoenix:\nAw, c'mon Chief. There's no need to be going so soon, is there?\nMia:\nListen, Wright! (Changed from [Wright!] in the original release) The defendant is the one on trial--your client!

Well, that's Larry Butz, Your Honor.Judge:\nCorrect. Just keep your wits about you and you'll do fine. Next question: This is a murder trial. Tell me, what's the victim's name?Phoenix:\n(Whew, I know this one! Glad I read the case report cover to cover so many times. It's... wait... Uh-oh! No... no way! I forgot! I'm drawing a total blank here!)Mia:\nPhoenix! Are you absolutely SURE you're up to this? You don't even know the victim's name!?Phoenix:\nOh, the victim! O-Of course I know the victim's name! I, um, just forgot. ...Temporarily (Changed from [I, um, just forgot. ... Temporarily.] in the original release)Mia:\nI think I feel a migraine coming on.

Who is the victim in this case?\"Cinder Block\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOh, um, wasn't it Ms. Block? Ms. Cinder Block?\nJudge:\nThe person in question was a victim of murder, not ill-conceived naming, Mr. Wright.\nMia:\nWright?

Now, tell me, what was the cause of death? She died because she was...?Poisoned\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOh, right! Wasn't she, um, poisoned by er... poison?\nJudge:\nYou're asking me!?\nPhoenix:\nUm... Chief! Help me out!\nMia:\nCheck the court record. [The R Button / Tab]... remember? (Changed from [Check the court record. The Court Record button... remember?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Geez. Give a guy a break!)\nJudge:\nLet me ask again.\nLeads back to:\n\"She died because she was...?\"Hit with a blunt object\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"She was struck once, by a blunt object.\"Strangled\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nRight... she was strangled, wasn't she?\nMia:\nPlease tell me that was you talking to yourself.\nJudge:\nIf you wish to hang yourself, Mr. Wright, you're welcome to, but not inside my courtroom. I suppose there's nothing to do but give you another try:\nLeads back to:\n\"She died because she was...?\"Phoenix:\nShe was struck once, by a blunt object.Judge:\nCorrect. You've answered all my questions. I see no reason why we shouldn't proceed. You seem much more relaxed, Mr. Wright. Good for you.Phoenix:\nThank you, Your Honor. (Because I don't FEEL relaxed, that's for sure.)Judge:\nWell, then... First, a question for the prosecution. Mr. Payne?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nAs Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to the court just what that \"object\" was?Payne:\nThe murder weapon was this statue of \"The Thinker.\" It was found lying on the floor, next to the victim.Judge:\nI see... The court accepts it into evidence. (Changed from [I see... the court accepts it into evidence.] in the original release)Statue added to the Court Record.Mia:\nWright... Be sure to pay attention to any evidence added during the trial. That evidence is the only ammunition you have in court. [Touch the Court Record button / Use the R Button] to check the Court Record frequently.Judge:\nMr. Payne, the prosecution may call its first witness.Payne:\nThe prosecution calls the defendant, Mr. Butz, to the stand.Phoenix:\nUm, Chief, what do I do now?Mia:\nPay attention. You don't want to miss any information that might help your client's case. You'll get your chance to respond to the prosecution later, so be ready! Let's just hope he doesn't say anything... unfortunate.Phoenix:\n(Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... This could be bad.) (Changed from [Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... this could be bad.] in the original release)Payne:\nAhem. Mr. Butz. Is it not true that the victim had recently dumped you?Butz:\nHey, watch it buddy! We were great together!

WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?Payne:\nMr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by \"dumped.\" In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!Butz:\nWhaddya mean, \"one of them\"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!Payne:\nYour Honor, the victim's passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.Passport added to the Court Record.Judge:\nHmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.Butz:\nDude... no way...Payne:\nThe victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several \"Sugar Daddies.\"Butz:\nDaddies? Sugar?Payne:\nYes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.Butz:\nDuuude!Payne:\nWe can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?Mia:\nWright... I don't think you want him to answer that question.Phoenix:\n(Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)Wait and see what happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Might be better not to get involved in this one...)\nPayne:\nWell, Mr. Butz?\nButz:\nDude, no way!

That question is irrelevant to this case!\nPayne:\nOof! *wince*\nButz:\nDude! Nick! Whaddya mean, \"irrelevant\"!? That cheatin' she-dog!\nLeads to:\n\"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!\"Butz:\nI'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I'm going to get to the bottom of this!Judge:\nLet's continue with the trial, shall we?Payne:\nI believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.Judge:\nYes, quite.Phoenix:\n(Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)Payne:\nNext question! You went to the victim's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?Butz:\nGulp!Payne:\nWell, did you, or did you not?Butz:\nHeh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn't!Phoenix:\n(Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)Have him answer honestly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I know!

So, like, I didn't see her.\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nYour Honor, the defendant is lying.\nJudge:\nLying?\nPayne:\nThe prosecution would like to call a witness who can prove Mr. Butz is lying.\nLeads to:\n\"Well, that simplifies matters.

Well then, we'll just have to remind you!\nPhoenix:\n(I got a bad feeling about this...)\nPayne:\nWe have a witness that can prove he DID go to the victim's apartment that day!\nLeads to:\n\"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?\"Judge:\nWell, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?Payne:\nThe man who found the victim's body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw the defendant fleeing the scene of the crime!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.Payne:\nYes, Your Honor.Phoenix:\n(This is bad...)Payne:\nOn the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim's building. Please bring Mr. Frank Sahwit to the stand!Payne:\nMr. Sahwit, you sell newspaper subscriptions, is this correct?Sahwit:\nOh, oh yes! Newspapers, yes!Judge:\nMr. Sahwit, you may proceed with your testimony. Please tell the court what you saw on the day of the murder.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Sahwit:\nI was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.\nI thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.\nThinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.\nThen I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!\nI quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.\nI thought to call the police immediately!\nHowever, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.\nI went to a nearby park and found a public phone.\nI remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.\nThe man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Judge:\nHmm...Phoenix:\n(Larry! Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!)Judge:\nIncidentally, why wasn't the phone in the victim's apartment working?Payne:\nYour Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.Judge:\nAren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.Blackout Record added to the Court Record.Judge:\nNow, Mr. Wright...Phoenix:\nYes! Er... yes, Your Honor?Judge:\nYou may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:\nC-Cross-examination, Your Honor?Mia:\nAlright, Wright, this is it. The real deal!Phoenix:\nUh... what exactly am I supposed to do?Mia:\nWhy, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!Phoenix:\nLies! What?! He was lying!?Mia:\nYour client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?Phoenix:\n!!! How do I prove he's not?Mia:\nYou hold the key! It's in the evidence! Compare the witness's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there! First, find contradictions between the Court Record and the witness's testimony. Then, once you've found the contradicting evidence... present it and rub it in the witness's face!Phoenix:\nUm... okay.Mia:\nOpen the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab], then point out contradictions in the testimony! (Changed from [Touch the Court Record button and point out contradictions in the testimony!] in the original release)Cross Examination"

Testimonies:

Sahwit: "I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment."
Sahwit: "I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him."
Sahwit: "Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment."
Sahwit: "Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!"
Sahwit: "I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside."
Sahwit: "I thought to call the police immediately!"
Sahwit: "However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working."
Sahwit: "I went to a nearby park and found a public phone."
Sahwit: "I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM."
Sahwit: "The man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there."
Question:

During the cross-examination, identify the contradiction in the witness's testimony by presenting the appropriate evidence at the correct statement.
In this example, the witness claims to remember the time exactly as 1:00 PM, but the Cindy's Autopsy Report records the time of death between 4 PM-5 PM. This discrepancy can be presented as evidence to contradict the witness's statement.

Answer:
{
  "action": "present",
  "testimony": 9,
  "evidence": 2
}You may now present evidence that is helpful in finding a contradiction in the testimony. To present evidence, answer the question with a JSON object in the format of {"action": "present", "testimony": <number of the testimony>, "evidence": <number of the evidence>}, for example {"action": "present", "testimony": 5, "evidence": 2}.
Note that the evidence, character, and testimony is listed from 0 to n-1, so your response should be 0-indexed.
Explain your reasoning step by step before providing the JSON object. 
 Conclude your answer with "Final Answer:" followed by the JSON object on a new line.
Do not write any things after the JSON and make sure you use "Final Answer:" followed by the JSON object.

That's good to hear. Actually, I'm calling because I have a favor to ask.???:
I know, I know. You want me to hold evidence for you?Mia:
Sharp as always! There's a lot of buzz about the upcoming trial... I just don't feel safe keeping the evidence here.???:
I gotcha. So, what is it this time?Mia:
It's... a clock.???:
A clock?Mia:
Yeah, it's made to look like that statue, "The Thinker." And it tells you the time! I thought you might like it. You always liked toys.???:
Hey! I'm not a little girl anymore, Sis!Mia:
Now, now. You know I'm only teasing. Ah, I should probably tell you, the clock isn't talking right now.???:
Huh? It's not working? That's lame!Mia:
I had to take the clockwork out. Sorry. I put some papers inside it instead.???:
Papers? Is that the evidence, then? Hmm, well... there's a possibility that it might turn out that way, yes.Mia:
Can you come by the office tonight, say 9:00, to pick it up? I'll be in a pretrial meeting until then.???:
Okay, Sis, but I expect dinner! Something good! Like... burgers! I could really go for a good burger.Mia:

Phoenix:

That smell... Blood!???:

(Someone's there!) ...! Chief? Chief...?Chief!!!Phoenix:

(The strange girl dropped out cold. I left her lying on the office sofa. I went back to the chief where she lay under the window. Her body was still warm... I could feel it when I held her shoulder. Then, all too quickly, it began to fade... Until finally she was cold.)Phoenix:
Chief...Examine









Broken glass







Phoenix:
Some shards of glass are scattered on the floor. They seem to be the remains of a glass light stand.




Chair







Phoenix:
The chief's chair. A simple, functional design. Feels pretty good to sit in, too.




Mia Fey's body







Phoenix:
Chief... It's hard seeing her like this, but if there are any clues here... She was struck on the head with a blunt object. She probably died instantly. "The Thinker" lying next to her must have been the murder weapon.
The Thinker added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
Hmm... there are some glass shards near the chief's body. Must be pieces of the glass light stand lying broken in the back of the room.
Glass Shards added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
Nothing else that seems like a clue here... Hmm...? A piece of paper! It must have fallen from Mia's hand! What could it be?




Mia Fey's body (subsequent times)







Phoenix:
It's painful to look... but I have to, for Mia's sake. Looks like she was hit in the head with a blunt weapon. She probably died instantly.

"The Thinker" statue







Phoenix:
It's encrusted with dried blood. How ironic that this became the murder weapon... again.




Window







Phoenix:
There's a large building right across from the office. The "Gatewater Hotel." A nice, luxurious place.




Bookshelf







Phoenix:
All the chief's important documents are packed in here. This is where she filed her case records and recent rulings.




Computer







Phoenix:
Surprisingly, the chief was never good with machines. About all she used this PC for was e-mail. She picked up this ancient model at some garage sale for practically nothing.




Desk







Phoenix:
A perfectly normal office desk. The chief had a very particular policy about office décor: "Spend big on stuff the clients use, but keep your own stuff simple."




Ledger book







Phoenix:
The Fey & Co. ledger book. Everything is written in the chief's ultra-neat handwriting. It's a small office, but it makes a good bit of money.




Corded phone







Phoenix:
Right! I'd better call the police! ...? That's funny... A few of the screws on the receiver are missing... It looks like someone was halfway through taking it apart.
???:
Police!? Please, come quick!
Phoenix:
(Wh-what was that!? Someone screaming from outside the window!?) ...! She's staring right at me! She's holding a phone in her hand...

Bookshelf







Phoenix:
You couldn't cram more legal books in here, even if you wanted to. Few can gaze upon the shelves without feeling insignificant.




Door







Phoenix:
The door to the chief's office. It's slightly open. I'd better not touch the door knob.




Painting







Phoenix:
A large painting. I guess you'd call this "modern art." I, on the other hand, call it a mistake.




Reception desk







Phoenix:
The reception desk. I usually sit here.




Sofa







Phoenix:
This sofa is for clients. It's leather... a real luxury model.




Writing desk







Phoenix:
A small writing desk cluttered with office supplies.Talk









What happened







Phoenix:
(She seems to be in shock. I don't want to disturb her, but I have to know...) Um... excuse me? Can you tell me what happened?
Maya:
... I came in... The room was dark. And Sis... Sis...!
Phoenix:
(So she was already dead.)




You and the Chief







Phoenix:
So, you're the chief's...?
Maya:
Sister. I'm her younger sister.
Phoenix:
And you were here... visiting? This late at night?
Maya:
Yes. She said she wanted me to keep some evidence for her.
Phoenix:
Evidence...?
Maya:
Yes... I-it was that clock... It was "The Thinker."Present









The Thinker







Phoenix:
Um, about "The Thinker"...
Maya:
! The Th-Thinker... That was... Oh, Sis! *sob*
Phoenix:
(Hmm, probably shouldn't have asked her about the murder weapon...)




Glass Shards







Phoenix:
This was lying next to the chief.
Maya:
I know. I saw it there too. I thought they might be pieces of the light stand.
Phoenix:
Hmm. Maybe. (Never heard of a glass light stand before...)




Receipt (before examining corded phone in Office)







Phoenix:
Before Mia died, she wrote a message with her own blood. She wrote it on the back of this receipt.
Maya:
! Th-th-that's MY name! W-why!? Why would she write my name?
Phoenix:
Please, just calm down.
Maya:
W-why would Sis write my name?
Phoenix:

Mia's younger sister, Maya, was arrested on the spot. I was taken in for questioning and didn't get out until the next morning. My eyes were heavy... but I couldn't sleep. I sat around, waiting for visiting hours to begin at the detention center. I had to talk to Maya as soon as possible.September 6, 9:07 AMDetention CenterVisitor's RoomPhoenix:

Well, that's what I wanted to talk to you about...It's up to you







Phoenix:
(I'd better give it to her straight...) It's up to you.
Maya:
Up... to me?
Phoenix:
Yes. I don't think this is something I should decide. After all, you're the one in trouble here.
Maya:
... They're never going to believe me... are they? Even you, when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it!
Leads to:
"Did I look at her like that?"Of course I will







Phoenix:
(First things first, I better get her cheered up...) Yeah, of course I will! Cheer up!
Maya:
R-really...?
Phoenix:
(Whoa! Did I say the wrong thing? She looks sadder now!) Um... what... what's wrong? You don't think I can do it?
Maya:
... No... no one could! Who would believe me? Even you, when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it!

Maya







Phoenix:
There's something I've been wanting to ask you...
Maya:
Yes?
Phoenix:
What's with that outfit?
Maya:
Oh, this? This is what all acolytes wear. It's my uniform, you could say.
Phoenix:
A-acolytes? Like people in religious training? What is it you do?
Maya:
Oh! It's nothing strange, really! I'm a spirit medium. ...In training.
Phoenix:
A s-spirit medium!? (I'm pretty sure that qualifies as strange.)




The day of the crime







Phoenix:
Could you tell me about the day of the murder?
Maya:
Yes! Let's see... that morning, I got a call from my sister. She wanted me to hold onto a piece of evidence for an upcoming trial.
Phoenix:
Evidence?
Maya:
Yes. That clock shaped like "The Thinker."
Phoenix:
(The one Larry made...) How could that have been evidence in a case?
Maya:
Um, right, she said something about that... ... I remember! Do you want to hear it in her own voice?
Phoenix:
H-her own voice!?
Maya:
Yes. I'm pretty sure our conversation is on my cell phone.
Phoenix:
You recorded it!
Maya:
Yeah! I forgot how to delete those things.




The day of the crime (after clearing "Your cell phone" Talk option)







Phoenix:
Could you tell me about the day of the murder? Sorry... I know it must be hard.
Maya:
No, it's okay. All I've been doing the last few hours is talking about it. I've kind of gotten used to it... Let's see... that morning, I got a call from my sister. She wanted me to hold onto a piece of evidence for an upcoming trial.
Phoenix:
(That's "The Thinker" clock that Larry made. It practically qualifies as a serial murderer by now.) So then, when did you arrive at the office?
Maya:
It was right around 9:00. The lights were off and... I could smell blood. Th-then I found her. My sister...
Phoenix:
Thanks, Maya. That's all I need to hear for now.




Your cell phone (appears after "The day of the crime")







Phoenix:
So, you say you have a conversation with your sister on your cell phone? Let's hear it!

Spirit mediums (appears after "Maya")







Phoenix:
So you're an acolyte. A, er, medium-in-training.
Maya:
That's right. The Fey family, especially the women, have always been very sensitive to the spirit world.
Phoenix:
Wait a second, you said the "Fey Family"? So, Mia was into this stuff too?
Maya:
Of course! She left the mountain to "follow her career," she said. Her powers were first-class, too!
Phoenix:
(I... I had no idea.) Hmm... Wait...!
Maya:
What?
Phoenix:
So, you're a real, honest-to-goodness spirit medium? With E.S.P. and all that?
Maya:
Yes. ...In training.
Phoenix:
Well, can't you contact Mia's spirit, then? We can just ask her who killed her!

So, Mia's death was instantaneous.
Gumshoe:
That's right, pal. She was... a beautiful person.
Phoenix:
You knew her, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Sure. All of us down at the precinct knew Ms. Fey. Much as it pains me to say this, she was a darn good lawyer. Hey, what are you looking at? I just got a little dust in my eye, that's all.




Maya







Phoenix:
Um, about Maya...
Gumshoe:
Yeah! I'm looking forward to the trial! Sorry, pal, but this is one trial you aren't going to win!
Phoenix:
W-why do you say that?
Gumshoe:
The city's put Prosecutor Edgeworth on the prosecution!
Phoenix:
(Edgeworth...)
Gumshoe:
I'm sure you know what that means, you being a lawyer and all.




Edgeworth (appears after "Maya")







Phoenix:
Prosecutor Edgeworth...
Gumshoe:
That's right, pal! Mr. Miles Edgeworth himself! Wait... you do know him, don't you!?



Of course I do!







Phoenix:
I know him. He's a feared prosecutor. He doesn't feel pain, he doesn't feel remorse. He won't stop until he gets his "guilty" verdict.
Gumshoe:
Aww, don't talk about him that way. You make him barely sound human! Still, I'm afraid this pretty much decides the case.
Phoenix:
(So, Edgeworth is on this one... He hasn't lost a case since he became prosecutor at the incredibly young age of 20. Of course, there are rumors of back-alley deals and forged evidence...)
Leads to:
"All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion."




Of course not!







Phoenix:
Never heard of him.

Whoa! And you call yourself a lawyer, pal!? About four years ago, this Edgeworth guy became a prosecutor at the age of 20! Everyone says he's a genius. Surprised you don't know him!

Glass Shards







Phoenix:
There was broken glass at the crime scene, right?
Gumshoe:
Hmm? Oh, that? Seems like a glass stand next to the victim fell over. The glass shards were pieces of the broken stand.




Receipt







Phoenix:
There was a piece of paper next to the victim, wasn't there?
Gumshoe:
Yeah. The one with the killer's name written on it!
Phoenix:
Are you sure that Mia wrote it herself?
Gumshoe:
Given the condition of the writing, it's hard to say if it's her handwriting or not.
Phoenix:
(So there's no proof that Mia wrote it.)




Maya's Memo







Phoenix:
I was wondering... did you see Maya Fey's cell phone?
Gumshoe:
Oh that? I have that.
Phoenix:
Do you think you could give it back?
Gumshoe:
Sure! I mean, wait a second, pal! Tricky lawyer!

Phoenix:
Oh, no, it's just... You know, Detective!
Gumshoe:
Nope. I know nothing, pal!

Uh huh. Oh, here, you can have the phone back. There weren't any suspicious call records in there, after all.

Gumshoe:
This? Hmm... it says "The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo"... "The Steel Samurai"... that action hero on TV?
Phoenix:
Yeah, you see that strap is a collector's item... She... was worried it might get lost if it went down to the precinct.
Gumshoe:

Um. Yes.

Yeah, Miss April May. I'm sorry 'bout this... But I can't tell you anything about her!Phoenix:
(Well, you just told me her name. Miss May, huh?) So you've sent her home already, then?Gumshoe:
Ahah! You're trying your lawyerly tricks on me now! She's not to go outside her room until the trial!Phoenix:
(So... she's still in the hotel across the way.) I guess I should know better than to try to get a detective to leak information.Gumshoe:
You got that right, pal!Phoenix:
(Time to pay a visit to Miss May!)September 6Grossberg Law OfficesPhoenix:
(According to the receptionist, the big boss is "out". She couldn't say when he'd be back. It must be hard to keep track of everything when you're a famous lawyer... Not to mention run an office like this. I guess I'll just have to come back later.)Examine









Bookshelf







Phoenix:
Expensive-looking mahogany bookshelves, filled with expensive-looking books. Hmm... funny... they don't look like they've ever been read.




Desk







Phoenix:
A solid mahogany desk. The wood's been polished to a deep luster.




Painting







Phoenix:
That painting has been bugging me ever since I stepped in here. The oil paint is so thick it's practically giving me a stuffed nose. I'm sure the price is nothing to sneeze at either, for that matter.




Potted plant







Phoenix:
An expensive potted plant. No idea what kind of plant it is, but it's probably the most expensive one available.




Table







Phoenix:
A table for clients. Hmm... an elegant ebony case, and if I'm not mistaken, that lighter's made of solid gold. Even I can tell someone here's got money to burn.Detention Center (after visitng Grossberg Law Offices, but before examining open drawer in Gatewater Hotel - Room 303)Maya:
Hey! What is it? Did you meet the lawyer?Phoenix:
Sorry. I haven't seen him yet.Maya:
I see...Phoenix:
(Hmm. I'd better go see if I can find this elite lawyer she's talking about.)Talk









Your family







Phoenix:
What about your family?
Maya:
I only had my sister. My father died when I was very young. And I don't know where my mother is.
Phoenix:
(Don't know...? So she could still be alive?)




Your mother (appears after "Your family")







Maya:
The women in my family have been mediums for generations. They say a lotta spiritual power runs in our blood. (Changed from [They say that E.S.P. runs in our blood.] in the original release) About fifteen years ago, our family was involved in an... incident. There was a man, and he... he... He ruined our mother's life.
Phoenix:
("Ruined"...?)
Maya:
After that, she disappeared. Several years after that, my sister announced she would "become a lawyer" and she left the mountain.
Phoenix:
... So, you live by yourself?
Maya:
Yes. I've gotten used to it. Oh, also... I had to become independent, or I would lose my powers! (Changed from [I had to become independent, or I would lose my E.S.P.!] in the original release)
Phoenix:
(I feel bad for her, all by herself up on that mountain...)




Your mother's enemy (appears after "Your mother")







Phoenix:
So, who was this man who, um, "ruined" your mother?
Maya:
About 15 years ago... there was an unusual murder case. It made quite a stir, everyone was talking about it, apparently. The police were running out of leads, and they were getting desperate...
Phoenix:
Wait... they didn't use a spirit medium, did they?
Maya:
The police convinced my mother to try to contact the victim.
Phoenix:
Wow... So, what happened?
Maya:
The case was solved... we thought.
Phoenix:
You "thought"...?
Maya:
The man my mother helped the police capture was innocent.
Phoenix:
...!
Maya:
The police's consultation with a medium had all been carried out in secret, of course. But... A man found out about it and leaked it to the press. He told all the papers that my mother was a fraud, and the media jumped on it big time. She... my mother... became the laughing stock of the nation.
Phoenix:
I see.
Maya:
... White...
Phoenix:
Excuse me? White?
Maya:
That was his name. My sister told me.
Phoenix:
White? Hmm...Present









Maya's Cell Phone







Phoenix:
Hey, I got your cell phone back.
Maya:
Oh! Say... Can I listen to my sister's voice?


Phoenix:
... (Maya's eyes closed... She listened to every word with such intensity... Before long, tears began to roll down her cheeks.) ...


Maya:
Thank you.September 6Gatewater Hotel - Room 303April:
Well! Hello there, handsome.Phoenix:
Umm... hi. (Smooth, Wright, real smooth.)April:

Bed







Phoenix:
A simple bed. It's been recently made. Nothing eye-catching here.




Flowers







Phoenix:
The flowers are fake, as expected. I know sunflowers and tulips, but that's about the extent of my floral knowledge.




Open drawer







Leads to:
"(There's a screwdriver stuck in this drawer.)"




Painting







Phoenix:
Ah. A still-scene painting. Wait, should that be "still life"? Whatever. One of those is hanging on the wall.




Table







Phoenix:
A bottle and two glasses are on the table. Somebody must be staying with her.




Window







Phoenix:
The late summer sunlight streams through the window. There's the Fey & Co. Law Offices building, of course. You can see the inside of the room pretty clearly from here. I think it would be a little difficult to recognize a face from this distance, though.Phoenix:
(There's a screwdriver stuck in this drawer. I wonder what's inside? Let's take a look...)April:
Hey! H-h-hey!!! What are you doing!? No touching! Oooh. Bad boy! Y-you really shouldn't pry around in other people's rooms, now. You wouldn't want to make me upset, would you?Phoenix:

What you witnessed







Phoenix:
Do you think you could tell me something? I need you to describe what you observed at the time of the incident.
April:
Ooh. "Observe," "incident"! You sound just like a lawyer in the movies! I like a man with a big... vocabulary.
Phoenix:
(Umm... *gulp* Better not encourage her.) Er... you know that thing that occur... um... happened the other day? The bad thing? What did you see when it happened? I don't suppose you could tell me about it? Pretty please?
April:
Let me see... Um, well... Dream on! If you want to know, you'll just have to come to the court tomorrow, Mr. Lawyer!
Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Um, could you... just who exactly are you?
April:
Oooh, Mr. Lawyer! Are you hitting on me?
Phoenix:
N-n-no! Hey! I'm just doing my job here!
April:
Tee hee! You know, you're cute when you blush.
Phoenix:
(Believe me, this is the first time in my life I've blushed this much...) Umm... eh heh. Right... can you just tell me what it is you do?
April:
Well... No! Tee hee! And you had your little hopes up, didn't you!
Phoenix:
(Oh boy.)




This room







Phoenix:
I see there are two glasses on the table. Is someone staying here with you?
April:
Oooh! What amazing powers of observation! You must be one of those famous detectives, like on television!
Phoenix:
Oh, no, not me, I'm, er, just a lawyer!

Say, Mr. Big Detective, why don't you go look for clues... in the garbage? Hmm? Miss May doesn't like nosey little lawyers... Hmph!

Hmm? Eh, ahem! Well, you see it's just... I'm busy, you see!

Hmm... ahem.

Mia trusted you... She knew her sister would be in good hands.
Grossberg:
Yes, yes, of course I know that. However! I'm sorry but, I must refuse. Sorry. Good-bye.

Phoenix:
Huh? Did you say something?
Grossberg:
I think not, I said.
Phoenix:

Grossberg:
I'm terribly, terribly sorry. But I'm afraid that no lawyer worth their salt will take on this particular case. Terribly sorry, m'boy.

Why!?

I... I cannot say. ... I beg your pardon, but could you leave? Now? I've nothing more to discuss with you.
Phoenix:

Mia







Phoenix:
How did you know Mia Fey...?
Grossberg:
... She... worked here. A long time ago. Quite the apprentice, that one. Learned my techniques in the blink of an eye! She left one day, quite suddenly... She had a mission, you see.
Phoenix:
A "mission"?
Grossberg:
You could see it in her eyes. She followed it with a burning passion. Never looked back, that one.

That's... quite a painting.

Ahah! You noticed! It's my pride and joy! Impressive, isn't it? Well? ISN'T IT? The color of the sky! The hue of the sea! The weave of the straw hat! It's worth at least three million. I have no intention of parting with it, of course. No, I won't sell it! Not even to you!

Part 4September 7, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 1Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Ms. Maya Fey.Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor. (Miles Edgeworth... I'd better not show any signs of weakness today, or he'll be on me in an instant.)Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth. Please give the court your opening statement.Edgeworth:
Thank you, Your Honor. The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, was at the scene of the crime. The prosecution has evidence she committed this murder... and we have a witness who saw her do it. The prosecution sees no reason to doubt the facts of this case, Your Honor.Judge:
I see. Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Let's begin then.Edgeworth:
If we may call our first witness, Your Honor. (Changed from [You may call your first witness.] in the original release) The prosecution calls the chief officer at the scene, Detective Gumshoe!Edgeworth:
Witness, please state your name and profession to the court.Gumshoe:
Sir! My name's Dick Gumshoe, sir! I'm the detective in charge of homicides down at the precinct, sir!Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe. Please, describe for us the details of this murder.Gumshoe:
Very well, sir! Let me use this floor map of the office to explain. The body was found by this window, here.Edgeworth:
And the cause of death?Gumshoe:
Loss of blood due to being struck by a blunt object, sir! The murder weapon was a statue of "The Thinker" found next to the body, sir! It was heavy enough to be a deadly weapon, even in a girl's hands, sir!Judge:
The court accepts the statue as evidence.Phoenix:
(They're still calling it a "statue"...)Floor Plans added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:
Now, Detective...Gumshoe:
Y-yes sir!Edgeworth:
You immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey, who was found at the scene, correct? Can you tell me why?Gumshoe:
Yes sir! I had hard evidence she did it, sir!Judge:
Hmm. Detective Gumshoe. Please testify to the court about this "hard evidence."Witness Testimony-- Maya Fey's Arrest --Gumshoe:
As soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!
There were two people there already:
The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.
I immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey!
Why? We had a witness account describing her!
The witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder!Judge:
Hmm... The very moment, you say. Very well. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor. (Cross-examine what...? I couldn't see a single contradiction in that testimony...)...whoosh...SMACK!Phoenix:
(Hey! Maya just threw something at me... What's this? "When my sister couldn't find any contradictions in a witness's testimony she would bluff it and press the witness on every detail! The witness always slips up and says something wrong... It worked lots of times!" Heh... I should have expected Maya would know some of her sister's tricks! Alright. Let's give this a try!)Judge:
Something the matter?Phoenix:
No, Your Honor. I'd like to begin my cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Maya Fey's Arrest --Gumshoe:
As soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Who did you say you got a call from?
Gumshoe:
Hey pal, don't play dumb! You know who! The call was from a customer at the Gatewater Hotel, right across from the crime scene!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... okay, I pressed. Not sure it did much, though.) Right. Please continue.Gumshoe:
There were two people there already:Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe, how long would you say it took, between you receiving the call, and your arrival at the scene of the crime?
Gumshoe:
Hmm, right... I'd say it was about 3 minutes!
Phoenix:
Th-that's pretty fast!
Gumshoe:
Our motto this month is "quick response"! That's how I got there before the killer got away!
Edgeworth:
Indeed! So, tell us who the two people you found on the scene were.
Gumshoe:
Yes sir!Gumshoe:

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Are you absolutely sure it was us?
Gumshoe:
Listen pal, your dumb act will only get you so far! With her funky hippie clothes and your spiky hair? You two stand out like... like suspicious people at a crime scene!
Phoenix:
(Well... he does have a point about her. She is pretty unmistakable. I should pick my points to press with a little more care...)Gumshoe:

Why's that? What's your reason?Gumshoe:
Why? We had a witness account describing her!Press

Phoenix:

(I can't see a single contradiction in there! I'll just have to take Maya's advice and press him on anything suspicious!)Phoenix:
Hold on just one second!Gumshoe:
Y-yeah?Phoenix:
If I heard correctly... You said you arrested her because you had "hard evidence" she did it, correct?Gumshoe:
Huh? Did... did I say that? Me?Phoenix:
I heard you say it!Judge:
You did say it.Edgeworth:
You said it.Phoenix:
Exactly what about this suspicious woman in pink's claim was "hard evidence"!?Gumshoe:
Wh-what!? Miss May isn't suspicious, and she sure isn't pink, pal! W-well, I guess she is pink...Judge:
That's enough, Detective Gumshoe. Do you have any more solid proof other than her claims, Detective?Gumshoe:
Umm...Phoenix:
(Hmm! I guess pressing can have its advantages!)Gumshoe:
... Yes.Phoenix:
(Gah!)Gumshoe:
Sorry, I got the order of things mixed up in my testimony, Your Honor Sir! There was something I should have told you about first, Your Honor!Judge:
Very well, Detective. Let's hear your testimony again.Witness Testimony-- Hard Evidence --Gumshoe:
After securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.
I found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!
On it, the word "Maya" was written clearly in blood!
Lab test results showed that the blood was the victim's!
Also, there was blood found on the victim's finger!
Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!
How you like that? That's my "hard evidence"!Judge:
Hmm... Before we begin cross-examination, I have a question for you, Detective.Gumshoe:
Y-Your Honor?Judge:
Why didn't you testify about this vital piece of evidence the first time!?Gumshoe:
Ah... eh... I know. I'm real embarrassed I forgot about it, Your Honor Sir.Judge:
Try to be more careful! Very well, the defense may begin its cross-examination.Cross Examination

2025-01-22 14:11:49,001 - INFO - Assistant reply: To address the testimony about the "hard evidence," we need to identify a contradiction by presenting relevant evidence. Let's analyze each statement provided by Detective Gumshoe in his testimony:

1. "After securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes."
   - This statement establishes the detective's presence and role at the crime scene but does not contain a contradiction.

2. "I found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!"
   - Refers to evidence found near the body. Let's verify the details related to this supposed memo.

3. "On it, the word 'Maya' was written clearly in blood!"
   - This statement is crucial. We need to check if there is contradictory information regarding the victim writing in blood.

4. "Lab test results showed that the blood was the victim's!"
   - This claims confirmation through lab results but doesn't directly offer evidence of a contradiction.

5. "Also, there was blood found on the victim's finger!"
   - Important because it suggests the victim might have written something herself.

6. "Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!"
   - This is a key point, suggesting the victim wrote "Maya" before dying. The autopsy report might contradict this if it shows the death was instantaneous.

Now, let's compare this to the evidence:

- The autopsy report states: "Time of death: 9/5 at 9:00 PM. Cause: single blunt force trauma. Death was instantaneous." 
- This describes that Mia's death was instantaneous initially, and later mentions she "may have lived for a few minutes."

Combining the analysis, the initial claim of an instantaneous death contradicts the possibility of writing a message before dying. Therefore, we should present the autopsy report against statement 6 (or any similar statement) to highlight this contradiction.

Well, I have to say Phoenix, I'm impressed! Not everyone takes on a murder trial right off the bat like this. It says a lot about you... and your client as well.Phoenix:\nUm... thanks. Actually, it's because I owe him a favor.Mia:\nA favor? You mean, you knew the defendant before this case?Phoenix:\nYes. Actually, I kind of owe my current job to him. He's one of the reasons I became an attorney.Mia:\nWell, that's news to me!Phoenix:\nI want to help him out any way I can! I just... really want to help him. I owe him that much.???:\n(It's over! My life, everything, it's all over!)Mia:\n... Is that your client screaming over there?

The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say it was you...)Phoenix:\nMy name is Phoenix Wright. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\" In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!August 3, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz. (Changed from [The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.] in the original release)Payne:\nThe prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:\nThe, um, defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:\nAhem.

Well, that's Larry Butz, Your Honor.Judge:\nCorrect. Just keep your wits about you and you'll do fine. Next question: This is a murder trial. Tell me, what's the victim's name?Phoenix:\n(Whew, I know this one! Glad I read the case report cover to cover so many times. It's... wait... Uh-oh! No... no way! I forgot! I'm drawing a total blank here!)Mia:\nPhoenix! Are you absolutely SURE you're up to this? You don't even know the victim's name!?Phoenix:\nOh, the victim! O-Of course I know the victim's name! I, um, just forgot. ...Temporarily (Changed from [I, um, just forgot. ... Temporarily.] in the original release)Mia:\nI think I feel a migraine coming on.

I suppose there's nothing to do but give you another try:\nLeads back to:\n\"She died because she was...?\"Phoenix:\nShe was struck once, by a blunt object.Judge:\nCorrect. You've answered all my questions. I see no reason why we shouldn't proceed. You seem much more relaxed, Mr. Wright. Good for you.Phoenix:\nThank you, Your Honor. (Because I don't FEEL relaxed, that's for sure.)Judge:\nWell, then... First, a question for the prosecution. Mr. Payne?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nAs Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to the court just what that \"object\" was?Payne:\nThe murder weapon was this statue of \"The Thinker.\" It was found lying on the floor, next to the victim.Judge:\nI see... The court accepts it into evidence. (Changed from [I see... the court accepts it into evidence.] in the original release)Statue added to the Court Record.Mia:\nWright...

You don't want to miss any information that might help your client's case. You'll get your chance to respond to the prosecution later, so be ready!

WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?Payne:\nMr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by \"dumped.\" In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!Butz:\nWhaddya mean, \"one of them\"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!Payne:\nYour Honor, the victim's passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.Passport added to the Court Record.Judge:\nHmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.Butz:\nDude... no way...Payne:\nThe victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several \"Sugar Daddies.\"Butz:\nDaddies? Sugar?Payne:\nYes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.Butz:\nDuuude!Payne:\nWe can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?Mia:\nWright... I don't think you want him to answer that question.Phoenix:\n(Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)Wait and see what happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Might be better not to get involved in this one...)\nPayne:\nWell, Mr. Butz?\nButz:\nDude, no way!

That question is irrelevant to this case!\nPayne:\nOof! *wince*\nButz:\nDude! Nick! Whaddya mean, \"irrelevant\"!? That cheatin' she-dog!\nLeads to:\n\"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!\"Butz:\nI'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I'm going to get to the bottom of this!Judge:\nLet's continue with the trial, shall we?Payne:\nI believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.Judge:\nYes, quite.Phoenix:\n(Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)Payne:\nNext question! You went to the victim's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?Butz:\nGulp!Payne:\nWell, did you, or did you not?Butz:\nHeh? Heh heh.

Who is your witness?\"Judge:\nWell, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?Payne:\nThe man who found the victim's body. Just before making the gruesome discovery...

Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.Payne:\nYes, Your Honor.Phoenix:\n(This is bad...)Payne:\nOn the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim's building.

Why didn't you tell the truth?

He was lying!?Mia:\nYour client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?Phoenix:\n!!! How do I prove he's not?Mia:\nYou hold the key! It's in the evidence! Compare the witness's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there!

(Changed from [Touch the Court Record button and point out contradictions in the testimony!] in the original release)Cross Examination"

Question:

During the cross-examination, identify the contradiction in the witness's testimony by presenting the appropriate evidence at the correct statement.
In this example, the witness claims to remember the time exactly as 1:00 PM, but the Cindy's Autopsy Report records the time of death between 4 PM-5 PM. This discrepancy can be presented as evidence to contradict the witness's statement.

Answer:
{
  "action": "present",
  "testimony": 9,
  "evidence": 2
}You may now present evidence that is helpful in finding a contradiction in the testimony. To present evidence, answer the question with a JSON object in the format of {"action": "present", "testimony": <number of the testimony>, "evidence": <number of the evidence>}, for example {"action": "present", "testimony": 5, "evidence": 2}.
Note that the evidence, character, and testimony is listed from 0 to n-1, so your response should be 0-indexed.
Explain your reasoning step by step before providing the JSON object. 
 Conclude your answer with "Final Answer:" followed by the JSON object on a new line.
Do not write any things after the JSON and make sure you use "Final Answer:" followed by the JSON object.

Who are you????:
...Phoenix:
(The strange girl dropped out cold. I left her lying on the office sofa. I went back to the chief where she lay under the window. Her body was still warm... I could feel it when I held her shoulder. Then, all too quickly, it began to fade... Until finally she was cold.)Phoenix:
Chief...Examine









Broken glass







Phoenix:
Some shards of glass are scattered on the floor. They seem to be the remains of a glass light stand.




Chair







Phoenix:
The chief's chair. A simple, functional design. Feels pretty good to sit in, too.




Mia Fey's body







Phoenix:
Chief... It's hard seeing her like this, but if there are any clues here... She was struck on the head with a blunt object. She probably died instantly. "The Thinker" lying next to her must have been the murder weapon.
The Thinker added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
Hmm... there are some glass shards near the chief's body. Must be pieces of the glass light stand lying broken in the back of the room.
Glass Shards added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
Nothing else that seems like a clue here... Hmm...? A piece of paper! It must have fallen from Mia's hand! What could it be?




Mia Fey's body (subsequent times)







Phoenix:
It's painful to look... but I have to, for Mia's sake. Looks like she was hit in the head with a blunt weapon. She probably died instantly.




"Maya" scrap of paper (after examining Mia Fey's body; before clearing all Talk options at Fey & Co. Law Offices)







Phoenix:
! A word is written in blood on this scrap of paper! "Maya"...? Did Mia write this? This piece of paper is a receipt from a department store, dated yesterday.
Receipt added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(I think that's enough snooping around for now. I'd better call the police... and find out what that girl was doing here.)

"The Thinker" statue







Phoenix:
It's encrusted with dried blood. How ironic that this became the murder weapon... again.




Window







Phoenix:
There's a large building right across from the office. The "Gatewater Hotel." A nice, luxurious place.




Bookshelf







Phoenix:
All the chief's important documents are packed in here. This is where she filed her case records and recent rulings.




Computer







Phoenix:
Surprisingly, the chief was never good with machines. About all she used this PC for was e-mail. She picked up this ancient model at some garage sale for practically nothing.




Desk







Phoenix:
A perfectly normal office desk. The chief had a very particular policy about office décor: "Spend big on stuff the clients use, but keep your own stuff simple."




Ledger book







Phoenix:
The Fey & Co. ledger book. Everything is written in the chief's ultra-neat handwriting. It's a small office, but it makes a good bit of money.




Corded phone







Phoenix:
Right! I'd better call the police! ...? That's funny... A few of the screws on the receiver are missing... It looks like someone was halfway through taking it apart.
???:
Police!? Please, come quick!
Phoenix:
(Wh-what was that!? Someone screaming from outside the window!?) ...! She's staring right at me! She's holding a phone in her hand...

Bookshelf







Phoenix:
You couldn't cram more legal books in here, even if you wanted to. Few can gaze upon the shelves without feeling insignificant.




Door







Phoenix:
The door to the chief's office. It's slightly open. I'd better not touch the door knob.




Painting







Phoenix:
A large painting. I guess you'd call this "modern art." I, on the other hand, call it a mistake.




Reception desk







Phoenix:
The reception desk. I usually sit here.




Sofa







Phoenix:
This sofa is for clients. It's leather... a real luxury model.




Writing desk







Phoenix:
A small writing desk cluttered with office supplies.Talk









What happened







Phoenix:
(She seems to be in shock. I don't want to disturb her, but I have to know...) Um... excuse me? Can you tell me what happened?
Maya:
... I came in... The room was dark. And Sis... Sis...!
Phoenix:
(So she was already dead.)




You and the Chief







Phoenix:
So, you're the chief's...?
Maya:
Sister. I'm her younger sister.
Phoenix:
And you were here... visiting? This late at night?
Maya:
Yes. She said she wanted me to keep some evidence for her.
Phoenix:
Evidence...?
Maya:
Yes... I-it was that clock... It was "The Thinker."Present









The Thinker







Phoenix:
Um, about "The Thinker"...
Maya:
! The Th-Thinker... That was... Oh, Sis! *sob*
Phoenix:
(Hmm, probably shouldn't have asked her about the murder weapon...)




Glass Shards







Phoenix:
This was lying next to the chief.
Maya:
I know. I saw it there too. I thought they might be pieces of the light stand.
Phoenix:
Hmm. Maybe. (Never heard of a glass light stand before...)




Receipt (before examining corded phone in Office)







Phoenix:
Before Mia died, she wrote a message with her own blood. She wrote it on the back of this receipt.
Maya:
! Th-th-that's MY name! W-why!? Why would she write my name?
Phoenix:
Please, just calm down.
Maya:
W-why would Sis write my name?
Phoenix:
(Uh-oh. Now I've done it... I'd better hurry up and call the police!)

Mia's younger sister, Maya, was arrested on the spot. I was taken in for questioning and didn't get out until the next morning. My eyes were heavy... but I couldn't sleep. I sat around, waiting for visiting hours to begin at the detention center. I had to talk to Maya as soon as possible.September 6, 9:07 AMDetention CenterVisitor's RoomPhoenix:

Well, that's what I wanted to talk to you about...It's up to you







Phoenix:
(I'd better give it to her straight...) It's up to you.
Maya:
Up... to me?
Phoenix:
Yes. I don't think this is something I should decide. After all, you're the one in trouble here.
Maya:
... They're never going to believe me... are they? Even you, when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it!
Leads to:
"Did I look at her like that?"Of course I will







Phoenix:
(First things first, I better get her cheered up...) Yeah, of course I will! Cheer up!
Maya:
R-really...?
Phoenix:
(Whoa! Did I say the wrong thing? She looks sadder now!) Um... what... what's wrong? You don't think I can do it?
Maya:
... No... no one could! Who would believe me? Even you, when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it!

Maya







Phoenix:
There's something I've been wanting to ask you...
Maya:
Yes?
Phoenix:
What's with that outfit?
Maya:
Oh, this? This is what all acolytes wear. It's my uniform, you could say.
Phoenix:
A-acolytes? Like people in religious training? What is it you do?
Maya:
Oh! It's nothing strange, really! I'm a spirit medium. ...In training.
Phoenix:
A s-spirit medium!? (I'm pretty sure that qualifies as strange.)




The day of the crime







Phoenix:
Could you tell me about the day of the murder?
Maya:
Yes! Let's see... that morning, I got a call from my sister. She wanted me to hold onto a piece of evidence for an upcoming trial.
Phoenix:
Evidence?
Maya:
Yes. That clock shaped like "The Thinker."
Phoenix:
(The one Larry made...) How could that have been evidence in a case?
Maya:
Um, right, she said something about that... ... I remember! Do you want to hear it in her own voice?
Phoenix:
H-her own voice!?
Maya:
Yes. I'm pretty sure our conversation is on my cell phone.
Phoenix:
You recorded it!
Maya:
Yeah! I forgot how to delete those things.




The day of the crime (after clearing "Your cell phone" Talk option)







Phoenix:
Could you tell me about the day of the murder? Sorry... I know it must be hard.
Maya:
No, it's okay. All I've been doing the last few hours is talking about it. I've kind of gotten used to it... Let's see... that morning, I got a call from my sister. She wanted me to hold onto a piece of evidence for an upcoming trial.
Phoenix:
(That's "The Thinker" clock that Larry made. It practically qualifies as a serial murderer by now.) So then, when did you arrive at the office?
Maya:
It was right around 9:00. The lights were off and... I could smell blood. Th-then I found her. My sister...
Phoenix:
Thanks, Maya. That's all I need to hear for now.




Your cell phone (appears after "The day of the crime")







Phoenix:
So, you say you have a conversation with your sister on your cell phone? Let's hear it!

Spirit mediums (appears after "Maya")







Phoenix:
So you're an acolyte. A, er, medium-in-training.
Maya:
That's right. The Fey family, especially the women, have always been very sensitive to the spirit world.
Phoenix:
Wait a second, you said the "Fey Family"? So, Mia was into this stuff too?
Maya:
Of course! She left the mountain to "follow her career," she said. Her powers were first-class, too!
Phoenix:
(I... I had no idea.) Hmm... Wait...!
Maya:
What?
Phoenix:
So, you're a real, honest-to-goodness spirit medium? With E.S.P. and all that?
Maya:
Yes. ...In training.
Phoenix:
Well, can't you contact Mia's spirit, then? We can just ask her who killed her!

Phoenix:
So, Mia's death was instantaneous.
Gumshoe:
That's right, pal. She was... a beautiful person.
Phoenix:
You knew her, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Sure. All of us down at the precinct knew Ms. Fey. Much as it pains me to say this, she was a darn good lawyer. Hey, what are you looking at? I just got a little dust in my eye, that's all.




Maya







Phoenix:
Um, about Maya...
Gumshoe:
Yeah! I'm looking forward to the trial! Sorry, pal, but this is one trial you aren't going to win!
Phoenix:
W-why do you say that?
Gumshoe:
The city's put Prosecutor Edgeworth on the prosecution!
Phoenix:
(Edgeworth...)
Gumshoe:
I'm sure you know what that means, you being a lawyer and all.




Edgeworth (appears after "Maya")







Phoenix:
Prosecutor Edgeworth...
Gumshoe:
That's right, pal! Mr. Miles Edgeworth himself! Wait... you do know him, don't you!?



Of course I do!







Phoenix:
I know him. He's a feared prosecutor. He doesn't feel pain, he doesn't feel remorse. He won't stop until he gets his "guilty" verdict.
Gumshoe:
Aww, don't talk about him that way. You make him barely sound human! Still, I'm afraid this pretty much decides the case.
Phoenix:
(So, Edgeworth is on this one... He hasn't lost a case since he became prosecutor at the incredibly young age of 20. Of course, there are rumors of back-alley deals and forged evidence...)
Leads to:
"All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion."




Of course not!







Phoenix:
Never heard of him.
Gumshoe:
Whoa! And you call yourself a lawyer, pal!? About four years ago, this Edgeworth guy became a prosecutor at the age of 20! Everyone says he's a genius. Surprised you don't know him!
Phoenix:
(Of course I know him... I was just playing dumb. He's a cold, heartless machine who'll do anything to get a "guilty" verdict! There are rumors of back-alley deals and forged evidence...)

Gumshoe:
That statue? That's the murder weapon.
Phoenix:
(Huh? He thinks the clock is just a statue, too... I'm starting to wish I'd never seen this thing.)




Glass Shards







Phoenix:
There was broken glass at the crime scene, right?
Gumshoe:
Hmm? Oh, that? Seems like a glass stand next to the victim fell over. The glass shards were pieces of the broken stand.




Receipt







Phoenix:
There was a piece of paper next to the victim, wasn't there?
Gumshoe:
Yeah. The one with the killer's name written on it!
Phoenix:
Are you sure that Mia wrote it herself?
Gumshoe:
Given the condition of the writing, it's hard to say if it's her handwriting or not.
Phoenix:
(So there's no proof that Mia wrote it.)




Maya's Memo







Phoenix:
I was wondering... did you see Maya Fey's cell phone?
Gumshoe:
Oh that? I have that.
Phoenix:
Do you think you could give it back?
Gumshoe:
Sure! I mean, wait a second, pal! Tricky lawyer!
Phoenix:
(Uh-oh, he's on to me!)



Tell him straight







Phoenix:
(Hmm... if I tell him why I want it there's no way he'll give it to me!)
Gumshoe:
Something the matter?
Phoenix:
Oh, no, it's just... You know, Detective!
Gumshoe:
Nope. I know nothing, pal!
Phoenix:
That cell phone has a lot of numbers on it... like her boyfriend's... A cell phone holds all a little girl's sweetest and spiciest secrets!
Gumshoe:
Urk? Y-you're trying to confuse me! Sorry, pal. I already checked all the numbers in memory!
Phoenix:
Impressive! You're quite the detective.
Gumshoe:
Uh huh. Oh, here, you can have the phone back. There weren't any suspicious call records in there, after all.

Tell him not-so-straight







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Oh, no, um... T-that carrying strap on the cell phone...
Gumshoe:
This? Hmm... it says "The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo"... "The Steel Samurai"... that action hero on TV?
Phoenix:
Yeah, you see that strap is a collector's item... She... was worried it might get lost if it went down to the precinct.
Gumshoe:
That what she said?
Phoenix:
Um. Yes.
Gumshoe:

Maya's Cell Phone received from Detective Gumshoe. (Changed from [Received: Maya's Cell Phone.] in the original release) Check the Court Record to hear the recorded conversation.




Mia's Autopsy Report







Phoenix:
Thanks for this!
Gumshoe:
Don't mention it, pal. When it comes to dealing with lawyers, "fight fair and square," is our motto!
Phoenix:
(I don't know how I feel, seeing everything written up like this... It makes Mia's death seem so... routine.)

Anything else







Gumshoe:
Hmm? What's that? Sorry, pal, but I got no info for the likes of you!After clearing "Mia" and "Maya" Talk options and presenting Maya's Memo:Phoenix:
(I guess I've asked all the questions I need to.)Gumshoe:
You all done, pal?Phoenix:
Um, yes, thank you. I'll be heading out now.Gumshoe:
Oh, wait. One more thing I wanted to mention to you. I don't suppose you're planning on talking to that witness. Anyway, you'd better not! No influencing the witness with your lawyerly ways, pal!Phoenix:
... (Come to think of it, I had completely forgotten about her...) The... witness?Gumshoe:
Yeah, Miss April May. I'm sorry 'bout this... But I can't tell you anything about her!Phoenix:
(Well, you just told me her name. Miss May, huh?) So you've sent her home already, then?Gumshoe:
Ahah! You're trying your lawyerly tricks on me now! She's not to go outside her room until the trial!Phoenix:
(So... she's still in the hotel across the way.) I guess I should know better than to try to get a detective to leak information.Gumshoe:
You got that right, pal!Phoenix:
(Time to pay a visit to Miss May!)September 6Grossberg Law OfficesPhoenix:
(According to the receptionist, the big boss is "out". She couldn't say when he'd be back. It must be hard to keep track of everything when you're a famous lawyer... Not to mention run an office like this. I guess I'll just have to come back later.)Examine









Bookshelf







Phoenix:
Expensive-looking mahogany bookshelves, filled with expensive-looking books. Hmm... funny... they don't look like they've ever been read.




Desk







Phoenix:
A solid mahogany desk. The wood's been polished to a deep luster.




Painting







Phoenix:
That painting has been bugging me ever since I stepped in here. The oil paint is so thick it's practically giving me a stuffed nose. I'm sure the price is nothing to sneeze at either, for that matter.




Potted plant







Phoenix:
An expensive potted plant. No idea what kind of plant it is, but it's probably the most expensive one available.




Table







Phoenix:
A table for clients. Hmm... an elegant ebony case, and if I'm not mistaken, that lighter's made of solid gold. Even I can tell someone here's got money to burn.Detention Center (after visitng Grossberg Law Offices, but before examining open drawer in Gatewater Hotel - Room 303)Maya:
Hey! What is it? Did you meet the lawyer?Phoenix:
Sorry. I haven't seen him yet.Maya:
I see...Phoenix:
(Hmm. I'd better go see if I can find this elite lawyer she's talking about.)Talk









Your family







Phoenix:
What about your family?
Maya:
I only had my sister. My father died when I was very young. And I don't know where my mother is.
Phoenix:
(Don't know...? So she could still be alive?)




Your mother (appears after "Your family")







Maya:
The women in my family have been mediums for generations. They say a lotta spiritual power runs in our blood. (Changed from [They say that E.S.P. runs in our blood.] in the original release) About fifteen years ago, our family was involved in an... incident. There was a man, and he... he... He ruined our mother's life.
Phoenix:
("Ruined"...?)
Maya:
After that, she disappeared. Several years after that, my sister announced she would "become a lawyer" and she left the mountain.
Phoenix:
... So, you live by yourself?
Maya:
Yes. I've gotten used to it. Oh, also... I had to become independent, or I would lose my powers! (Changed from [I had to become independent, or I would lose my E.S.P.!] in the original release)
Phoenix:
(I feel bad for her, all by herself up on that mountain...)




Your mother's enemy (appears after "Your mother")







Phoenix:
So, who was this man who, um, "ruined" your mother?
Maya:
About 15 years ago... there was an unusual murder case. It made quite a stir, everyone was talking about it, apparently. The police were running out of leads, and they were getting desperate...
Phoenix:
Wait... they didn't use a spirit medium, did they?
Maya:
The police convinced my mother to try to contact the victim.
Phoenix:
Wow... So, what happened?
Maya:
The case was solved... we thought.
Phoenix:
You "thought"...?
Maya:
The man my mother helped the police capture was innocent.
Phoenix:
...!
Maya:
The police's consultation with a medium had all been carried out in secret, of course. But... A man found out about it and leaked it to the press. He told all the papers that my mother was a fraud, and the media jumped on it big time. She... my mother... became the laughing stock of the nation.
Phoenix:
I see.
Maya:
... White...
Phoenix:
Excuse me? White?
Maya:
That was his name. My sister told me.
Phoenix:
White? Hmm...Present









Maya's Cell Phone







Phoenix:
Hey, I got your cell phone back.
Maya:
Oh! Say... Can I listen to my sister's voice?


Phoenix:
... (Maya's eyes closed... She listened to every word with such intensity... Before long, tears began to roll down her cheeks.) ...


Maya:
Thank you.September 6Gatewater Hotel - Room 303April:
Well! Hello there, handsome.Phoenix:
Umm... hi. (Smooth, Wright, real smooth.)April:
You're the lawyer, aren't you? The detective told me... He said, "Don't say nothing to that lawyer, pal!" Tee hee!Phoenix:
(Memo to self: thank Detective Gumshoe for making my job harder.)April:
Gee! This is all like something out of a movie! It's all so exciting I can hardly contain myself! Ooh! Let me go freshen up so I can look the part of the beautiful eyewitness!Phoenix:
(I pity the lawyer that has to cross-examine this one.)Examine









Bed







Phoenix:
A simple bed. It's been recently made. Nothing eye-catching here.




Flowers







Phoenix:
The flowers are fake, as expected. I know sunflowers and tulips, but that's about the extent of my floral knowledge.




Open drawer







Leads to:
"(There's a screwdriver stuck in this drawer.)"




Painting







Phoenix:
Ah. A still-scene painting. Wait, should that be "still life"? Whatever. One of those is hanging on the wall.




Table







Phoenix:
A bottle and two glasses are on the table. Somebody must be staying with her.




Window







Phoenix:
The late summer sunlight streams through the window. There's the Fey & Co. Law Offices building, of course. You can see the inside of the room pretty clearly from here. I think it would be a little difficult to recognize a face from this distance, though.Phoenix:
(There's a screwdriver stuck in this drawer. I wonder what's inside? Let's take a look...)April:
Hey! H-h-hey!!! What are you doing!? No touching! Oooh. Bad boy! Y-you really shouldn't pry around in other people's rooms, now. You wouldn't want to make me upset, would you?Phoenix:
(Upset!? I thought she was going to explode for a second there! I wonder what could be inside the drawer?)Examine

Phoenix:
(Hmm... what's inside I wonder?)
April:

Phoenix:

What you witnessed







Phoenix:
Do you think you could tell me something? I need you to describe what you observed at the time of the incident.
April:
Ooh. "Observe," "incident"! You sound just like a lawyer in the movies! I like a man with a big... vocabulary.
Phoenix:
(Umm... *gulp* Better not encourage her.) Er... you know that thing that occur... um... happened the other day? The bad thing? What did you see when it happened? I don't suppose you could tell me about it? Pretty please?
April:
Let me see... Um, well... Dream on! If you want to know, you'll just have to come to the court tomorrow, Mr. Lawyer!
Phoenix:
(Oh boy.)




Miss May







Phoenix:
Um, could you... just who exactly are you?
April:
Oooh, Mr. Lawyer! Are you hitting on me?
Phoenix:
N-n-no! Hey! I'm just doing my job here!
April:
Tee hee! You know, you're cute when you blush.
Phoenix:
(Believe me, this is the first time in my life I've blushed this much...) Umm... eh heh. Right... can you just tell me what it is you do?
April:
Well... No! Tee hee! And you had your little hopes up, didn't you!
Phoenix:
(Oh boy.)




This room







Phoenix:
I see there are two glasses on the table. Is someone staying here with you?
April:
Oooh! What amazing powers of observation! You must be one of those famous detectives, like on television!
Phoenix:
Oh, no, not me, I'm, er, just a lawyer!
April:
Say, Mr. Big Detective, why don't you go look for clues... in the garbage? Hmm? Miss May doesn't like nosey little lawyers... Hmph!
Phoenix:
(Oh boy.)Present









Anything







April:
Excuse me, but I'm a witness? Police witness? You understand? How could I possibly give you any information in good conscience, hmm? Me... "the witness"! It's just like the movie!Grossberg Law Offices (after examining open drawer in Gatewater Hotel - Room 303)Phoenix:

*Ah-HHHHEM!*Phoenix:

Ah hah! So, you're the one they say has been looking for me?Phoenix:
Uh... y-yes, that's me! (He looks even... grander than I imagined!)Grossberg:
Hmm...? That badge on your collar...? Ah, so you're a lawyer, are you now?Phoenix:
Y-yes, well... yes.Grossberg:
And what do you want? I'm not particularly busy these days... Please, proceed!Phoenix:
(Not busy...? Then how come no one could get in touch with you?)Grossberg:
Hmm? Something the matter? You came to see the one-and-only Marvin Grossberg, did you not? Well, here I am, boy! What do you want? Out with it!Phoenix:
Um... w-well, sir, actually it's about Maya. Maya Fey.Grossberg:
...! Ah... yes. Maya Fey. Go on.Phoenix:
(Hmm? Why the strange reaction?)Grossberg:
A-cha-cha. I'm really quite busy here, son. I can't go taking cases on a day's notice! No, it's quite impossible.Phoenix:
W-wait a second! How did you know the trial was tomorrow!?Grossberg:
Urk? Ahem! A-anyway... I'm afraid it's entirely impossible for me to represent her. Sorry. End of discussion.Phoenix:
(What's going on!? He refused me before I even got a chance to ask him! What do I tell Maya...?)Talk









Your refusal







Phoenix:
How can you just refuse like that! Please, tell me why you won't take the case!
Grossberg:
Hmm? Eh, ahem! Well, you see it's just... I'm busy, you see!
Phoenix:
But the client is Mia Fey's sister!
Grossberg:
Hmm... ahem.
Phoenix:
Mia trusted you... She knew her sister would be in good hands.
Grossberg:
Yes, yes, of course I know that. However! I'm sorry but, I must refuse. Sorry. Good-bye.
Phoenix:
Creep. Fine. I don't have time to argue with you anyway. I'll go look elsewhere.
Grossberg:
*grumble*... Think not.
Phoenix:
Huh? Did you say something?
Grossberg:
I think not, I said.
Phoenix:
Wh-what do you mean?
Grossberg:
I'm terribly, terribly sorry. But I'm afraid that no lawyer worth their salt will take on this particular case. Terribly sorry, m'boy.
Phoenix:
Why!?
Grossberg:
I... I cannot say. ... I beg your pardon, but could you leave? Now? I've nothing more to discuss with you.
Phoenix:
(What's going on here!?)




Mia







Phoenix:
How did you know Mia Fey...?
Grossberg:
... She... worked here. A long time ago. Quite the apprentice, that one. Learned my techniques in the blink of an eye! She left one day, quite suddenly... She had a mission, you see.
Phoenix:
A "mission"?
Grossberg:
You could see it in her eyes. She followed it with a burning passion. Never looked back, that one.




That painting







Phoenix:
That's... quite a painting.
Grossberg:
Ahah! You noticed! It's my pride and joy! Impressive, isn't it? Well? ISN'T IT? The color of the sky! The hue of the sea! The weave of the straw hat! It's worth at least three million. I have no intention of parting with it, of course. No, I won't sell it! Not even to you!
Phoenix:

Part 4September 7, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 1Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Ms. Maya Fey.Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor. (Miles Edgeworth... I'd better not show any signs of weakness today, or he'll be on me in an instant.)Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth. Please give the court your opening statement.Edgeworth:
Thank you, Your Honor. The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, was at the scene of the crime. The prosecution has evidence she committed this murder... and we have a witness who saw her do it. The prosecution sees no reason to doubt the facts of this case, Your Honor.Judge:
I see. Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Let's begin then.Edgeworth:
If we may call our first witness, Your Honor. (Changed from [You may call your first witness.] in the original release) The prosecution calls the chief officer at the scene, Detective Gumshoe!Edgeworth:
Witness, please state your name and profession to the court.Gumshoe:
Sir! My name's Dick Gumshoe, sir! I'm the detective in charge of homicides down at the precinct, sir!Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe. Please, describe for us the details of this murder.Gumshoe:
Very well, sir! Let me use this floor map of the office to explain. The body was found by this window, here.Edgeworth:
And the cause of death?Gumshoe:
Loss of blood due to being struck by a blunt object, sir! The murder weapon was a statue of "The Thinker" found next to the body, sir! It was heavy enough to be a deadly weapon, even in a girl's hands, sir!Judge:
The court accepts the statue as evidence.Phoenix:
(They're still calling it a "statue"...)Floor Plans added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:
Now, Detective...Gumshoe:
Y-yes sir!Edgeworth:
You immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey, who was found at the scene, correct? Can you tell me why?Gumshoe:
Yes sir! I had hard evidence she did it, sir!Judge:
Hmm. Detective Gumshoe. Please testify to the court about this "hard evidence."Witness Testimony-- Maya Fey's Arrest --Gumshoe:
As soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!
There were two people there already:
The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.
I immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey!
Why? We had a witness account describing her!
The witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder!Judge:
Hmm... The very moment, you say. Very well. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor. (Cross-examine what...? I couldn't see a single contradiction in that testimony...)...whoosh...SMACK!Phoenix:
(Hey! Maya just threw something at me... What's this? "When my sister couldn't find any contradictions in a witness's testimony she would bluff it and press the witness on every detail! The witness always slips up and says something wrong... It worked lots of times!" Heh... I should have expected Maya would know some of her sister's tricks! Alright. Let's give this a try!)Judge:
Something the matter?Phoenix:
No, Your Honor. I'd like to begin my cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Maya Fey's Arrest --Gumshoe:
As soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Who did you say you got a call from?
Gumshoe:
Hey pal, don't play dumb! You know who! The call was from a customer at the Gatewater Hotel, right across from the crime scene!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... okay, I pressed. Not sure it did much, though.) Right. Please continue.Gumshoe:
There were two people there already:Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe, how long would you say it took, between you receiving the call, and your arrival at the scene of the crime?
Gumshoe:
Hmm, right... I'd say it was about 3 minutes!
Phoenix:
Th-that's pretty fast!
Gumshoe:
Our motto this month is "quick response"! That's how I got there before the killer got away!
Edgeworth:
Indeed! So, tell us who the two people you found on the scene were.
Gumshoe:
Yes sir!Gumshoe:
The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Are you absolutely sure it was us?
Gumshoe:
Listen pal, your dumb act will only get you so far! With her funky hippie clothes and your spiky hair? You two stand out like... like suspicious people at a crime scene!
Phoenix:
(Well... he does have a point about her. She is pretty unmistakable. I should pick my points to press with a little more care...)Gumshoe:

(I can't see a single contradiction in there! I'll just have to take Maya's advice and press him on anything suspicious!)Phoenix:
Hold on just one second!Gumshoe:
Y-yeah?Phoenix:
If I heard correctly... You said you arrested her because you had "hard evidence" she did it, correct?Gumshoe:
Huh? Did... did I say that? Me?Phoenix:
I heard you say it!Judge:
You did say it.Edgeworth:
You said it.Phoenix:
Exactly what about this suspicious woman in pink's claim was "hard evidence"!?Gumshoe:
Wh-what!? Miss May isn't suspicious, and she sure isn't pink, pal! W-well, I guess she is pink...Judge:
That's enough, Detective Gumshoe. Do you have any more solid proof other than her claims, Detective?Gumshoe:
Umm...Phoenix:
(Hmm! I guess pressing can have its advantages!)Gumshoe:
... Yes.Phoenix:
(Gah!)Gumshoe:
Sorry, I got the order of things mixed up in my testimony, Your Honor Sir! There was something I should have told you about first, Your Honor!Judge:
Very well, Detective. Let's hear your testimony again.Witness Testimony-- Hard Evidence --Gumshoe:
After securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.
I found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!
On it, the word "Maya" was written clearly in blood!
Lab test results showed that the blood was the victim's!
Also, there was blood found on the victim's finger!
Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!
How you like that? That's my "hard evidence"!Judge:
Hmm... Before we begin cross-examination, I have a question for you, Detective.Gumshoe:
Y-Your Honor?Judge:
Why didn't you testify about this vital piece of evidence the first time!?Gumshoe:
Ah... eh... I know. I'm real embarrassed I forgot about it, Your Honor Sir.Judge:
Try to be more careful! Very well, the defense may begin its cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Hard Evidence --Gumshoe:

Now, now, don't jump the gun on me, pal. Just listen. I'm getting to the good part!
Phoenix:

I found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Just because you found it next to the body doesn't mean the victim wrote it!
Gumshoe:
Ho hoh! Then who did write it, smarty-pants?
Phoenix:
Wh-who? Um...



The killer







Phoenix:
Th-the killer! Anyone can see that!
Gumshoe:
Hoh. You're saying the killer wrote her OWN name!? Buddy, please!
Phoenix:
She was framed!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Hold on. If that's the case, where's your evidence?
Phoenix:
Ah... (Urk!)
Edgeworth:
Hah! I guess that was a bit of a tall order for you. Those without evidence shouldn't open their mouths, Mr. Wright.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, pal!
Phoenix:
(Argh...!)
Leads to:
"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found."




Miss May







Phoenix:
Well... it could have been the witness, Miss May!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Hold on. The witness was in her hotel room, not the office. Try pulling the other leg, Mr. Wright!
Gumshoe:
Yeah, and while you're at it, pull mine too, pal!
Phoenix:
(Argh...!)
Leads to:
"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found."




I did







Phoenix:
It... it could have been me!
Gumshoe:
What! S-so it was you!
Phoenix:
No, no, no, I'm just saying it COULD have been me! Can you prove it wasn't?
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Hold on. So, you admit to this? You admit that you wrote the note?
Phoenix:
Uh...
Edgeworth:
Listen to me, Mr. Wright. This is a court of law, and I expect you to refrain from making thoughtless statements! Amateur!

Do you have proof it was Mia who wrote that!?

Of course I do, pal!

What kind of "tests" were these again?
Gumshoe:
Huh? What kind? Umm... well... I hear they take the, um, little bits in the blood, the... er... hemo... hemogl... Hermo... goblins... hobgob... Er...? Herma-goblin bobbin... I-I refuse to testify on this matter, sir! I'm no expert on blood tests!
Judge:
Yes, that was quite clear. You may continue with your testimony.
Gumshoe:
Th-thanks, pal. I mean Your Honor Sir.
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe.
Gumshoe:
Y-yeah?
Edgeworth:
I think you can expect a pleasant bonus in your next pay check.

Oh? Oh hoh hoh.

Phoenix:
On which hand was the bloody finger, Detective?
Gumshoe:
The right hand!

Hah hah hah! Nice try!

Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe! Do you get a lot of cases where the victim actually writes the killer's name?
Gumshoe:
Sure! It happens all the time in books and the movies!
Phoenix:
This isn't a movie, Detective.
Gumshoe:
Oof!
Phoenix:
Let's talk about reality, shall we?
Gumshoe:
Umm... I guess, I haven't heard of many cases... no.
Phoenix:
Don't you find it a little odd that the victim would write down a name? Especially the name of her own sister?
Gumshoe:
Ah, yeah, actually, you got a point, pal.
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Stop right there. The witness's opinion on the matter is irrelevant! The facts are clear: the victim wrote down the name of the accused... The victim told us the name of her killer!
Judge:
Order! Order!
Phoenix:
(That didn't go so well...)
Gumshoe:
Th-that's right! What he said!Present Mia's Autopsy Report







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Detective Gumshoe!"Phoenix:
(That's his whole testimony... Okay, there has to be a contradiction in there somewhere. Let's find it!)Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe! There's one thing I want you to clarify for me here. You say that the victim, Mia Fey, wrote this note. That she was accusing the defendant, Maya Fey? That's really what you're saying?Gumshoe:
Wh-what? This isn't one of those lawyer tricks, now, is it? Of course she wrote it! Who else could have!?Phoenix:
You have it backwards, Detective.Gumshoe:
B-backwards?Phoenix:
The victim is the only person who absolutely could NOT have written it! This is a report from your department, Detective. "Immediate death due to a blow from a blunt object." She died immediately!Gumshoe:
But...!Phoenix:
No "but"-ing your way out of this one, Detective!Judge:
Order! Order! The defense has a point. Someone who died immediately wouldn't have the time to write anything down.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright. I beg your pardon, but when exactly did you obtain that autopsy report?Phoenix:
Wh-when...!?The day of the murder







Phoenix:
I... I'm pretty sure it was the day of the murder.
Gumshoe:
You're wrong there, pal! We didn't write an autopsy report 'til the day after!
Phoenix:
Oh. Right.
Leads to:
"The prosecution's point being...?"The day after the murder







Phoenix:
It was the day after the murder...
Leads to:
"The prosecution's point being...?"I forget







Phoenix:
I'm... sorry, I forgot.
Edgeworth:
Hah! Forgot, you say?
Gumshoe:
It was the day after the murder, Your Honor Sir. I was the one who handed it to him myself! Personally!
Phoenix:
Oh. R-right.
Leads to:
"The prosecution's point being...?"Judge:
The prosecution's point being...?Edgeworth:
That autopsy report is outdated, Your Honor.Phoenix:
Wh-what!?Edgeworth:
A second autopsy was performed yesterday, at my request! "Death was almost immediate due to a blow from a blunt object... But there is a possibility the victim lived for several minutes after the blow." I received these results this morning.Phoenix:
N-no way!Edgeworth:
Your Honor! It's quite easy to imagine that the victim did have time to write "Maya"! That is all.Judge:
I see!Phoenix:
(Damn you, Edgeworth! I should have known you'd have something up your sleeve!)Edgeworth:
Why, Mr. Wright, you look shocked! Something you want to say?You're a sham, Edgeworth!







Phoenix:
Mr. Edgeworth... I've heard there's nothing you won't do to get your verdict... What reason could you possibly have had to request a second autopsy report?
Judge:
Mr. Wright! The defense will refrain from personal attacks on the prosecution!
Edgeworth:
No matter, Your Honor... Mr. Wright. Say what you will, the evidence in this report is undeniable.
Leads to:
"Your Honor, I submit this report to the court."The detective's a sham!







Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe! You're a sham! How could you give me a faulty report!?
Gumshoe:
Huh? I-I thought...
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe.
Gumshoe:
Urp!
Edgeworth:
I'm disappointed in you, handing him the wrong report like that.
Gumshoe:
Eh...? I... I'm sorry, sir.
Edgeworth:
You are at fault, Detective. This isn't going to look good on your evaluation next month.
Gumshoe:
W-what? B-but... *sigh*
Leads to:
"Your Honor, I submit this report to the court."I'm a sham!







Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe. Are you calling me a fool because I believed your report?
Gumshoe:
Huh? Me? I-I'm not... huh?
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe.

Urp!

Your Honor, I submit this report to the court.Judge:
U-understood. The court accepts the evidence.Autopsy Report updated in the Court Record.Edgeworth:
Well, Your Honor? The evidence strongly suggests the victim was identifying the killer.Judge:
I suppose that's the obvious conclusion, yes.Phoenix:
(Darn! This isn't good!)Edgeworth:
The prosecution would like to call its next witness. This poor, innocent girl saw the murder with her own eyes!Judge:
Let the witness Miss April May take the stand.Phoenix:
(Exactly what part of her is "innocent"...?)Edgeworth:
Witness, your name, please.April:
April May! At your service! *wink*Judge:
Order! An introduction should not require any reaction from the crowd! The witness will refrain from wanton winking! ([wanton] misspelled as [wonton] in the original release)April:
Aww... Yes, Your Honor.Phoenix:
(This is not good... She's already captured the heart of every man in the court!)Edgeworth:
Tell us, where were you on the night of September 5, when the murder occurred?April:
Um... gee... I was, like, in my hotel room? Tee hee. I checked in right after lunch.Edgeworth:
And this hotel is directly across from the Fey & Co. Law Offices?April:
Mmm... that's right, big boy.Judge:
Please testify to the court about what you saw.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --April:
It was, like, 9:00 at night. I looked out the window, y'know!
And then, oooh! I saw a woman with long hair being attacked!
The one attacking her was the mousey girl sitting in the defendant's chair!
Then the woman, like, dodged to one side and ran away!
But that girl, she caught up to her and... and... She hit her!
Then the woman with long hair...
She kinda... slumped.
The end. That's all I saw. Every little bitsy witsy! *wink*Judge:
Hmm...Edgeworth:
Well, Your Honor?Judge:
I see. It is a remarkably solid testimony. I don't see a need to trouble the witness any...Phoenix:
W-wait, Your Honor!Judge:
Yes, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:
What about my cross-examination!?Judge:
I thought the witness's testimony just now was quite... firm. Didn't you?Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright... I understand you were Ms. Mia Fey's understudy, were you not? You must know her techniques well. Her cowardly way of finding tiny faults in perfectly good testimonies...Phoenix:
H-hey! How dare you!Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? Will you cross-examine the witness?Yes, I'm doing it







Phoenix:
I'll gladly proceed with the cross-examination. (If only because I have a feeling Edgeworth doesn't want me to! She has to have some weakness!)
Leads to:
"Very well, you may begin your cross-examination!"No thanks







Phoenix:
No... you're right. I guess there wouldn't be much point.
Edgeworth:
Heh heh heh. I'm glad you saw the error of your ways so soon! Your Honor. The prosecution rests its case!
Phoenix:
(Wh-what? That's it!?)
Judge:
Very well.
Phoenix:
W-wait! Hold on!
Judge:
Yes, Mr. Wright? Changed your mind? Will you cross-examine the witness?
Phoenix:
Yes yes yes! (I'd better, or I'll lose on the spot!)
Leads to:
"Very well, you may begin your cross-examination!"Judge:
Very well, you may begin your cross-examination!Cross Examination-- Witness's Account --April:

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Why did you do that?
April:
Huh? "Why"? Like, why what?
Phoenix:
Why did you look out the window? Were you expecting to see something?
April:
Oh, well, um... gee!
Phoenix:
(What? That's it? She can't get out of this question that easily!)
April:
I sort of, y'know. I had a feeling!
Phoenix:
(Well, I have a feeling she's trying to avoid the question! Maybe I should press a little harder on this one?)



Go for it







Phoenix:
(Let's see how far I can run with this...) Surely, you must have had a reason to look out your window at that time of night!
April:
I... oooh!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright! I will not have you badgering my witness!
Phoenix:
B-badgering?
Edgeworth:
You insist on needling her with these trivial questions. I really don't think it should be allowed.
(Yeah! Yeah! Stop him!)
(The poor girl!)
Judge:
Order! Mr. Wright, you have been warned.
Phoenix:
(Poor girl!? What about poor me!?)
Leads to:
"You looked out the window. What did you see next?"




Back down







Phoenix:

The woman with long hair... that was Mia Fey?
April:
Um-hmm! Slender, sort of, well, some people might say pretty, if that's your thing.
Phoenix:
(Your... thing?)
Edgeworth:
And the person attacking her?April:
The one attacking her was the mousey girl sitting in the defendant's chair!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
How do you know she was the defendant?
April:
Huh? Well... y'know! S-she had a girlish physique. Women know these things. Look... I-I just know, okay?
Edgeworth:
There was only one person at the scene of the crime with a short, girlish figure. The testimony is bulletproof, Your Honor.
Phoenix:
(He's right...)



Yep, he's right







Phoenix:
(Her testimony certainly does make sense... And everyone in the court keeps siding with her. I'd better not press too hard on this one.)
Edgeworth:
So then, tell us what happened to the victim.

Well... the attack!

Phoenix:

How did you know it was my client!?
April:
Huh? Well, I... gee! First of all, she had a girl's physique! And, and secondly, she was... she was small! Who else could it be but her!
Phoenix:
(She has a point...)



You're right







Phoenix:

I question your testimony

"Hold on a minute! That testimony stinks!"Phoenix:
(Hmm... that's it? Nothing really jumps out as a contradiction... There's got to be something in there somewhere! Maybe I'd better just press her on the facts a bit!)Phoenix:
Hold on a minute! That testimony stinks!April:
W-what!?Phoenix:
Miss May, I'm willing to bet that...You saw nothing







Phoenix:
Did you really see the defendant at all!?
Leads to:
"Urp!"You're lying







Phoenix:
Are you telling the truth? Did you really see the defendant!?
Leads to:
"Urp!"April:
Urp!Judge:
Mr. Wright! What's the meaning of this?April:
Yes, what is the meaning! Somebody tell me because I'm clueless! About this, I mean!Phoenix:
Okay... If you had really witnessed my client, Maya Fey... You would have noticed her clothes before noticing her physique!April:
...!Phoenix:
No one wears clothes like this on a daily basis! Except her! And I'm no expert on fashion, but her hairdo looks far from normal to me! However, the witness's testimony mentions neither of these things! The testimony is bogus!April:
But... but!Judge:
Still, we don't know if she was dressed that way the night of the murder...Phoenix:
She was, Your Honor! I saw her. And so did Detective Gumshoe! What do you say to that, Miss May?April:
Rowr! What are you trying to say, you mean lawyer! I-I saw what I saw. I... just didn't think all the trifling little details were necessary, darling.Judge:
Miss May. The court would like to remind you to please omit nothing in your testimony.April:
I'm sorry, Your Honor. I'll be a good girl. I promise. *wink*Judge:
Your testimony again, if you would.Phoenix:
(Damn, I almost had her!)Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --April:
I did see everything! I did!
The victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right.
Then the girl in the hippie clothes ran after her...
And she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did!
That... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? "The Thinker," I think?
Well? Does the accuracy of my report not startle you? Tee hee!Judge:
I... see. I only wish you had been so detailed from the beginning. Please begin the cross-examination.Cross Examination

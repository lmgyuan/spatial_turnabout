4: I looked out over the lake, but I didn't notice the boat.

Part 6Episode 4Turnabout GoodbyesIt's been, what, 15 years?About that, yes.15 years is a long time to wait... You can't imagine how much I've suffered...You... suffered?And now... the perfect opportunity presents itself. At last... I shall have my revenge!What!?...Merry Christmas.December 25, 10:08 AMWright & Co. Law OfficesMaya:
Hey, hey, Nick! Do you know if there's any good waterfalls around here?Phoenix:
Waterfalls...? Dare I ask why?Maya:
Duh, Nick! Isn't it obvious? I need a waterfall to stand under! Preferably a freezing one!Phoenix:
... Oh... Is that part of your spirit medium training?Maya:
Of course! Except, I've been slacking off lately... I need to brave the elements and be forged anew under the rushing spring waters!Phoenix:
Umm... Okay... I don't know about any falls per se, but Gourd Lake is pretty close...Maya:
Oh. Darn.Phoenix:
Sorry, but them's the breaks. Couldn't you just take a cold shower or something?Maya:
... Good idea!Phoenix:
(So much for the rushing spring waters...)TV:
Next in the news... A large, unidentified animal was sighted at Gourd Lake! The town is buzzing with excitement! Locals are calling it "Gourdy" in a tip of the hat to Nessie, the Loch Ness monster. Though its namesake, Nessie, proved to be a hoax... locals are confident their Gourdy is the real deal. ...Phoenix:
*yawn* Bor-ing. Can't they show real news for a change?Maya:
Nick?Phoenix:
?Maya:
The water pressure's kind of low in that shower.Phoenix:
... You want more pressure, huh? Why don't you go down to the fire department and have them spray you with the hose?Maya:
... Good idea, Nick!Phoenix:
(Apparently, Fey blood is no aid in detecting sarcasm...) (Changed from [Apparently, E.S.P. is no aid in detecting sarcasm...] in the original release)TV:
We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin! Strange occurrences continue at Gourd Lake... But this time, it's murder!Phoenix:
(Gourd Lake again?)TV:
The body of a man was found in the lake early this morning. A suspect was apprehended. Sources inside the police department revealed... that the suspect's name is Miles Edgeworth, age 24. Edgeworth was an up-and-coming prosecution attorney, known for his skill and connections. He was guaranteed a long and rewarding career... Has he thrown it all away?Phoenix:
(...? E-Edgeworth!?) What's going on!? Edgeworth would never do something like--Maya:
Nick?Phoenix:
Yipes! M-Maya!Maya:
The fireman yelled at me when I called him.Phoenix:
We've got bigger things to worry about than that! They arrested Edgeworth!Maya:
What? You mean, the prosecutor?Phoenix:
Yeah, he's a suspect... in a murder!Maya:
Whaaaaat!? When? Where? Whom? Why? How?Phoenix:
I-I don't know!Maya:
Let's go find out, Nick!Examine









Bookshelf







Phoenix:
Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. I tried reading one, and it made my head hurt. When I closed it, it slipped out of my hand. Then my foot hurt too.




Charley the plant







Phoenix:
Mia's favorite plant. Its name is "Charley." Maya's gotten the knack of watering it lately. Charley's been perking up these days.




Desk







Phoenix:
Mia's desk. If we had more clients, I would probably sit here more often. Lately, I've been spending more time on the couch, watching TV.




Movie poster







Phoenix:
Maya brought in a poster of the Steel Samurai the other day. We had a big fight over whether to put it up or not. I know she's just waiting for a chance to sneak it up on the wall.




Window







Phoenix:
Looks like it's cleaning day again at the hotel across the way. I hear they're planning a second branch outside the city. I can see the bellboy, getting the angle of that screwdriver in the drawer just right.Talk









What to do







Phoenix:
Well, what should we do?
Maya:
What do you mean!? Let's investigate! We should talk to Mr. Edgeworth, and check out the crime scene!
Phoenix:
(You're right... We need more information! Save aimlessness and confusion for later!)




Any ideas







Phoenix:
Well? Got any good ideas?
Maya:
Not really. I do my best thinking when I'm standing underneath a waterfall.Present









Attorney's Badge







Phoenix:
You know, I think it's developing a nice luster.
Maya:
I'll look at your badge later, Nick. We've got work to do!
Phoenix:
(I suppose you're right...)December 25Detention CenterVisitor's RoomMaya:
You know, Nick... We've all been in here one time or another, haven't we?Phoenix:
I guess it comes with the territory.Maya:
I'm not sure it's something we should mention to too many people... Aah!Phoenix:
... Hey! Edgeworth! Come back!Edgeworth:
What are you doing here!?Maya:
Nick, I don't think he's in a very good mood.Phoenix:
Well, he is in detention. Were you in a good mood when you were here?Edgeworth:
So, you've come to laugh at the fallen attorney? Then laugh, laugh! Well? Why aren't you laughing?Maya:
Nick... Should we be laughing?Phoenix:
Nah. It's a trick. Laugh and he'll get mad... or burst into tears. Edgeworth. We don't have so much free time we can spend it coming down here to laugh at you.Edgeworth:
... Yes you do.Phoenix:
(Actually, he's right.)Edgeworth:
... I hoped you wouldn't come. I didn't want you to see me. Not like this.Phoenix:
(I didn't want to see you like this, either. Believe me.) (Changed from [Hey, I didn't want to see you either, believe me.] in the original release)Examine









Surveillance camera







Phoenix:
Smile for the camera...




Security guard







Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch since I came in. A real pro. Or maybe he's just nervous with Edgeworth in the room.Talk









What happened







Phoenix:
Edgeworth. Tell me what happened.
Edgeworth:
... Why should I? What are you going to do about it?
Maya:
Duh! We're going to help you, that's what!
Edgeworth:
...! ... Help me? You? Don't be ridiculous.
Phoenix:
Sorry...?
Edgeworth:
You're a novice! You've only been in three trials!
Phoenix:
H-hey!
Edgeworth:
Sure, you got lucky and won all three... But your luck's bound to run out some day! You need real skill, Wright. Experience!
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
Nick! He's insulting you! Nick? Why am I always the one who has to get angry!?




Gourd Lake







Phoenix:
The murder took place at Gourd Lake, correct?
Edgeworth:
Yes... late last night.
Phoenix:
The lake is a long way away from your offices and the court... Why were you down there?
Edgeworth:
... I see no need to tell you.
Maya:
M-Mr. Edgeworth! You... you didn't really...?
Edgeworth:
... Gourdy.
Maya:
Huh?
Edgeworth:
I went to see Gourdy.
Maya:
"Gourdy"? What's that!?
Phoenix:
I'll... tell you later. (Why won't Edgeworth talk to us?)




Did you do it (appears after "What happened", "Gourd Lake", and presenting Attorney's Badge)







Phoenix:
Edgeworth... this is really hard for me to ask... But... you didn't do it, right? Right?
Edgeworth:
... Think what you will. I have only one request.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Edgeworth:
Stay out of this case.
Maya:
Why!? B-but Nick is trying to help you!
Edgeworth:
I know...! I know that! But I don't want your help, okay?
Maya:



Why not?
Edgeworth:
... Look, just go away, and leave me alone!
Maya:
Nick... Mr. Edgeworth did it, didn't he.
Phoenix:
Maya! Let's go investigate elsewhere.
Maya:
But, Nick...Present









Attorney's Badge







Edgeworth:
Your attorney's badge...?
Phoenix:
Edgeworth. Let me defend you.
Edgeworth:
... Hah! Hah hah! Good one, Wright. But I'm not that hard up. Not yet.
Maya:
Wh-what do you mean by that?
Edgeworth:
Me? Trust a wet-behind-the-ears lawyer with only three trials under his belt? Never!
Maya:
Wh-what!?
Edgeworth:
My case is near hopeless, Wright. Every defense attorney I've talked to has turned me down.
Phoenix:
What?
Edgeworth:
Simply put, they were afraid they'd lose. It occurred to me that it might be my fault that they lack confidence. After all, I did get every single one of their clients declared "guilty."
Phoenix:
I don't believe it!
Edgeworth:
Regardless, I don't want you involved in this. You in particular I cannot ask to do this.December 25Gourd Lake ParkEntranceMaya:
This is where it happened?Phoenix:
Yeah. Gourd Lake is in the middle of this park.Maya:
I can see some police walking around in there.Phoenix:
Questioning people, probably.Maya:
Hey! Isn't that Detective Gumshoe over there?Gumshoe:
Well, pal!? There's enough of us here! Anyone found anything?Police:
S-sorry, sir... Nothing.Gumshoe:
Idiot! The trial's tomorrow! We need clues, on the double!Police:
B-but, sir... There weren't any clues... that's why we arrested that attorney, Mr. Edgeworth! It's clear, sir. He's the one who--Gumshoe:
Shaddup! Just you try saying that again! I'll... I'll... I'll make you sorry if you do! (Changed from [I'll... er... I'll make you sorry if you do!] in the original release) So just... just, get outta my face, pal! (Changed from [I mean... just, get outta my face, pal!] in the original release)Police:
Y-yes, sir!Maya:
Detective Gumshoe's kinda scary today!Gumshoe:
Recruits... peh! ... Aah!Maya:
Eek!Gumshoe:
Hey, you're that Harry guy! Harry Butz!Phoenix:
Wright! Phoenix Wright! (Will he ever learn my name!?)Gumshoe:
And just what are you doing here, pal? Investigating!?Phoenix:
Huh? Um, well, yes. I suppose.Gumshoe:
Well, I'm here to help! Ask me anything you want! Bring it!Maya:
He seems different than usual. I wonder what's up? Umm... Mr. Edgeworth hasn't actually asked us to defend him yet...Gumshoe:
Huh!? Oh? Y-you don't say...Examine









Trees







Phoenix:
I feel winter's chill from the bare leaf trees today... *sigh* What is it about winter that turns people into poets?
Maya:
I don't know, but my toes are starting to feel numb.
Phoenix:
(Yes... my poetry has that effect on some people.)




Sign







Phoenix:
The sign says "Gourd Lake Nature Park." This place is full of families picnicking on the weekend.
Maya:
But... no waterfall.
Phoenix:
Not many picnickers come here for spiritual training, Maya.Talk









What happened







Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe? Do you know what happened here?
Gumshoe:
Huh? You don't know, pal?
Phoenix:
No...
Gumshoe:
Wow, okay, Mr. Head-in-the-fluffy-pink-clouds Lawyer.
Phoenix:
Head-in-the... huh?
Gumshoe:
Never mind, I'll tell you. It happened last night, about 15 minutes after midnight. There was a boat out on Gourd Lake. In that boat were two men. One of those men shot the other with a pistol.
Maya:
And... the shooter was Mr. Edgeworth?
Gumshoe:
A cop who arrived on the scene arrested him.
Maya:
How did they get there so fast? (Changed from [How did he get there so fast?] in the original release)
Gumshoe:
Well... There was a witness. When the report came in, we raced to the lake.
Phoenix:
A witness?




Edgeworth







Maya:
You don't think Mr. Edgeworth is a... murderer, do you!? (Changed from [You don't think Mr. Edgeworth is a... murderer!?] in the original release)
Gumshoe:
Absolutely not! It's impossible! I don't care if there's a witness either! I don't believe a lick of it!
Maya:
R-right! Who cares what the witness says!
Phoenix:
(I care!)
Maya:
... You really believe in him, don't you, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Course I do! But... the police are pretty sure he's the killer. Nobody's even really taking this investigation that seriously.
Maya:
Oh no!
Gumshoe:
After all the help Mr. Edgeworth has been to us... Hard to imagine that no one's standing up to take his side.
Maya:
Well, at least you are, Detective. At least you are.




Defense request







Maya:
Do you know who will be Mr. Edgeworth's defense attorney in tomorrow's trial?
Gumshoe:
He hasn't got one yet.
Maya:
What? The trial IS tomorrow, isn't it?
Gumshoe:
Well, I don't know the whole story... But apparently no one he's been talking to will take his case.
Maya:
W-why not?
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth won't tell me! When you guys showed up, I figured he'd asked you to defend him.
Phoenix:
U-unfortunately not...
Gumshoe:
Well, pal, then you got a job to do! Help out Mr. Edgeworth! Prove that badge you wear isn't just some fancy piece of metal! Prove it to me, pal! Show me you're an attorney!




Defense request (after presenting Attorney's Badge in Detention Center - Visitor's Room)







Maya:
I-is it true? No one will take Mr. Edgeworth's case?
Gumshoe:
Yeah... He's a bit of a celebrity. If you defended him, and lost, your reputation'd be sure to suffer. What's more... The case against him is... well, it's pretty solid.
Phoenix:
(I suppose it would be if they have a witness.)
Gumshoe:
Hey! Pal! Don't tell me your going to turn your back on him too!? Remember the Steel Samurai case? (Changed from [Remember the Steel Samurai!] in the original release) Mr. Edgeworth helped you get your client declared innocent!
Phoenix:
I... I know. I went to Edgeworth. I tried. He really doesn't want us to represent him. Especially not us, he said.
Gumshoe:
What!? W-well, that doesn't make any sense, pal! You should have heard him talking about you after that trial! (Changed from [You should have heard him talking about you after the Steel Samurai case!] in the original release) He kept saying "Wright, Wright, Wright," over and over.
Maya:
... Nick? I'm not sure that's a good sign.
Phoenix:
Neither am I...
Gumshoe:
Why wouldn't he want your help? I don't get it.




The witness (appears after "What happened")







Phoenix:
Who was this witness?
Gumshoe:
Er, sorry, pal. That's confidential. Anyway, the witness saw everything, apparently. I'm sure they'll turn up at the trial tomorrow.
Phoenix:
Was there only that one witness?
Gumshoe:
Yep. It was pretty cold out on the lake last night. And, it was Christmas Eve after all. Still, we're being thorough. You never know when you're going to turn up another witness. That's why we're here today, checking things out. So far, we're coming up empty...
Maya:
Oh! It's Christmas today! I'd forgotten. What are you getting me for Christmas, Nick?
Phoenix:
Talk to Santa.Present









Attorney's Badge







Gumshoe:
That badge! You're showing that to the wrong guy, pal! You gotta show that to someone who needs it!After clearing all Talk options:Police:
Detective Gumshoe, sir!Gumshoe:
What? Find something!?Police:
Um, no, sir. Not yet. But there was a call from the precinct. They want to hold an investigation briefing...Gumshoe:
A briefing? Right! I'm off! Oh... Sorry, pal. I guess you heard. I gotta go. Any last things you want to ask me about before I head back?The autopsy report







Maya:
Well, yes. Do you have any information on the victim...?
Gumshoe:
Sorry... They haven't worked up the autopsy report yet. I'm still waiting for it myself. Actually... Say, if you get the time, drop by the precinct! We can talk more there, pal!
Leads to:
"You're not coming back, Detective?"How to get in touch with you







Leads to:
"You're not coming back, Detective?"Phoenix:
You're not coming back, Detective?Gumshoe:
Erm... Probably not, pal.Phoenix:
So, what should we do if we have something to talk to you about...?Gumshoe:
Ah, right. Here, I'll show you how to get to the precinct. Come down and see me anytime.Detective Gumshoe gave you directions to the police station.Phoenix:
Oh, hey! Detective Gumshoe!Gumshoe:
W-what!?Phoenix:
Um, we'd like to take a look around in the park. Can we walk around?Gumshoe:
Yeah! No problem, pal. You got my permission.Maya:
You know, Nick. I think there's something to be said for talking to people when they're busy.Phoenix:
Yeah. They don't have time to think about not giving you information...Maya:
Right! Now, let's get investigating!December 25Police DepartmentCriminal AffairsMaya:
... Looks like Detective Gumshoe isn't here.Chief:
Something wrong, miss? Hmm? Turning yourself in? Okay, what did you do? Shoplifting? Larceny? Public indecency...?Maya:
N-no! None of those things! We're looking for Detective Gumshoe... is he around?Chief:
Gumshoe? Oh yeah. He's in a meeting right now. I don't think he'll be out any time soon.Maya:
Okay, we'll come back.Chief:
You do that. Oh, and go straight home and stay out of trouble. No more shoplifting, you got that?Maya:
... Do I look like a criminal or something?Examine









Poster







Phoenix:
A poster of a female police officer... Wait, no. That's the latest "Babes in Uniform" calendar. My bad.




Detective







Phoenix:
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
Police:
"...your mama could see you know she'd be crying'... ...a break and spit it out, you lowlife scumbag..."
Phoenix:
... He must be doing image training for interrogations.




Desk







Phoenix:
These are the detectives' desks. There are computers and files on each one. Funny, they're a lot tidier than I'd expect. I guess the detectives don't spend a lot of time at their desks.




Blue Badger







Phoenix:
Hey, is that the police department's mascot...?
Chief:
That's the "Blue Badger"! It was my idea! I made it! It's my mascot!
Phoenix:
I... see. How nice.
Chief:
I'll get him assigned mascot of the Criminal Affairs Dept. if it's the last thing I do!
Phoenix:
Um, good luck!




Chief







Phoenix:
This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen.
Chief:
Wha...!? "Gourd Lake...!" "Gourdy sighted"!!! I don't believe it!
Phoenix:
(Shouldn't you be reading something more important...?)December 25Gourd LakePublic BeachMaya:
Wowsers! This is "Gourd Lake"?Phoenix:
Yup. I'm not sure it warrants a "wowsers," though.Maya:
Hmm. Probably not. But hey, look at that snack stand!Phoenix:

I wanna Samurai Dog! Please! I bet they're great!Phoenix:
With a name like Samurai Dog, how could they not be?Maya:
They're a little behind the times, though. The kids are all into "The Pink Princess" now. I mean, like, y'know!?Phoenix:
(Nope.)Examine









Lake







Maya:
Wow. Gourd Lake is really big.
Phoenix:
Yeah.
Maya:
Say, Nick. Why is it called "Gourd Lake"?
Phoenix:
Oh. Well, a long time ago, they used to grow gourds here.
Maya:
Whoa! No way! I was sure it was because the lake looked like a gourd when viewed from above! You know, like an hourglass shape?
Phoenix:
Well, it is shaped like a gourd, actually. But that's just a coincidence.
Maya:
Oh. Okay.




Trash can







Phoenix:
The trashcan is empty. At least the place is well maintained.




Bench







Phoenix:
A lineup of plastic benches. I guess the idea is you buy a dog and eat it here. I doubt anyone would sit here and eat on a day like this. Except maybe Maya... if she had a Samurai Dog.




Sign







Phoenix:
Huh... I almost didn't see that signpost. "Left - Boat docks" "Right - Exit"




Vendor stand







Phoenix:
A hotdog stand. It's closed... The Christmas fringe looks a little half-baked. The banner reads "Samurai Dogs"... Somebody needs to redecorate.




Popper







Maya:
Huh. Someone left some poppers here. You know, you pull the string... (Changed from [Huh. Someone left one of those poppers here. You know, you pull the string...] in the original release)
Phoenix:
...And it goes "pop." Yeah, I know the ones. You see them a lot around New Year's.

Anything else







Edgeworth:
What's that? I'm not in the mood for idle banter, Wright.December 25Boat Rental ShopMaya:
Nick... what is this place?Phoenix:
A boat rental shop. Closed for Christmas it seems. I guess a murder taking place on one of the boats won't be good for business, either.Maya:
Boats... I've never ridden on a boat.Phoenix:
Really? Well, how about we go out on one when the trial is finished?Maya:
Hey, good idea! You bet!Examine









Trees







Phoenix:
There's more forest off that way. I doubt I'd find any helpful clues in there.




Shop







Phoenix:
A small boat rental shop. Doesn't look like anyone is around. They're probably closed because it's Christmas.




Boats







Phoenix:
There are some boats floating at the dock. Was one of these boats used in the murder, I wonder?
Maya:
Nick?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Maya:
I changed my mind. I don't really want to go for a boat ride.December 25Gourd Lake WoodsMaya:
I like it here, Nick. Look... someone's camping!Phoenix:

(That's true...) Good call, Maya. Let's go talk to them.Examine









Camera







Maya:
Hey, Nick. Check out this camera!
Phoenix:
Yeah... what's with the big mic and that box on top, I wonder? It looks like some sort of automatic system for taking a photo when a noise is heard.
Maya:
Wow! Hey, let's see if it works! *cough* "Hi, I'm Nick!" ... Maybe I'm not saying it loud enough. "YO! I'M NICK!!!" ... Huh. NIIIIIIIIII......IIIIIIIIIICK!
Phoenix:

Phoenix:
D-don't kick it! (It must not be set up to respond to voices.)

Leads to:
"This camera has a mic and some sort of attachment."




Trees







Phoenix:
The trees grow quite thick here. Further back, the trees fade into the shadow where the sunlight can't reach them.




Sign







Phoenix:
The sign says "No Camping." Funny place to pick to pitch your tent.
Maya:
Wait, what if the sign said "No Setting Tents on Fire"?
Phoenix:
... I don't think they have signs like that.
Maya:
Oh...




Sheet







Phoenix:
There's food and some magazines on the sheet. It takes a pretty tough skin to camp in this cold.




Campfire







Maya:
Hey, Nick!
Phoenix:
What, don't tell me you're hungry again?
Maya:
No, no. I was just wondering, why are camping pots and pans made of aluminum?
Phoenix:
... They didn't talk about that in any of the law books.
Maya:
So, there's no law saying they have to be made out of aluminum, then!
Phoenix:
(I'm not having this conversation...)




SUV







Phoenix:
This SUV has seen better days. It's dented all over. I can't believe anyone would drive their car down here.Phoenix:
This camera has a mic and some sort of attachment. It must take pictures when triggered by a noise.Maya:

What happened







Lotta:
Oh yeah, when was that murder, anyway? I ain't seen much television lately.
Phoenix:
It happened late in the night on Christmas Eve.
Lotta:
That so? Christmas Eve?
Phoenix:
A man on a boat was shot... Did you see anything?
Lotta:
Well, lemme see. A boat, ya say? I reckon I mighta seen one... not sure though. Y'all gotta remember I've been watching this here lake for a good three days now. I seen enough boats to choke a mule. Kinda hard to remember which I seen when.

So, how did the meeting go?
Gumshoe:
I can't tell you, pal! You're a lawyer!
Phoenix:
T-true...
Gumshoe:
... Y'know... I don't know what to believe anymore. Sure, Mr. Edgeworth's human like you or me. Still... I get the feeling that if he'd done something wrong, he wouldn't go hiding it. That's just the kind of guy he is. Why can't anyone else see that?
Maya:
So, they think that Mr. Edgeworth did it...?
Gumshoe:
Well, the trial's starting tomorrow, as scheduled.
Maya:
I see...
Gumshoe:

Umm... hey, in the end you did tell us about the meeting!
Gumshoe:

And... do me a favor! Stand by Mr. Edgeworth! He needs help, and you're the ones to help him! I'm sure he's got some reason why he won't talk to us.
Maya:
Thanks, Detective Gumshoe.




Trusting Edgeworth (appears after "The meeting")







Maya:
Detective Gumshoe... How come you trust Mr. Edgeworth so much?
Gumshoe:
Well, I'd think that was obvious. We got a strong working relationship, us two. We trust each other, and that's how it works.
Maya:
A "working relationship"?
Gumshoe:
See, Mr. Edgeworth always gets his defendants declared "guilty" every time. Yeah, his methods might be a little extreme at times. But... there's a reason! He trusts our investigation, see? He trusts us to get the right man! That's why I work extra hard, pal. We've got to earn that trust he places in us.
Maya:
I see...
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth is a man you can trust... And you have my word on that!

What to do







Phoenix:
Well, what should we do?

A... monster?
Butz:
Yeah. Check it out. This is an article from yesterday's newspaper. There's a photo!
Maya:
Wow! It's r-really real! Nick! A monster! A real monster!
Phoenix:
Umm... yeah. (It's probably just a log or something... right?) Hey... there's a quote here from the person who took the photo. Hmm? What's this? "I set the camera to automatic, and when we got into the frame... I heard a loud 'bang'! Like an explosion... followed by the sound of something slipping into the water..."
Maya:
I wish I could have seen it!
Phoenix:
(Why would there be a sound like an explosion...?) Larry. Could I borrow this article from you?

Sure, no problem. That'll be one million dollars!

O-one million...?

A murder?

Well, Miles Edgeworth shot someone with a pistol.

Robert Hammond (appears after presenting Autopsy Report)







Phoenix:
Who is this Hammond guy, anyway?
Grossberg:
Mr. Hammond... He was the defense attorney in that case...
Phoenix:
"That case"...?
Grossberg:
Yes, the "DL-6 Incident."
Phoenix:
"DL-6"...? (Why does that sound so familiar?)
Grossberg:
Perhaps you remember?
Phoenix:
(I'm sure someone mentioned it during the trial for Mia's murder.)
Grossberg:
That was the incident where the police were so at a loss they used a spirit medium.
Maya:
...! Wait... you don't mean? Was that medium my mother?
Grossberg:
Yes, my dear. The spirit medium, Misty Fey, your mother, contacted the spirit of the victim. But... the case was a loss. No conviction was made.




The DL-6 Incident (appears after "Robert Hammond")







Grossberg:
The DL-6 Incident, yes... Happened 15 years ago. A very strange case, indeed.
Phoenix:
They never caught the criminal, right?
Grossberg:
Correct. Misty Fey used her powers to talk to the spirit of the late victim. Her testimony led to charges being laid against one man. But Mr. Hammond won the case and the suspect was declared innocent.
Maya:
... And the police blamed my mother, calling her a fraud. You were the one who helped her out then, right, Mr. Grossberg?
Grossberg:
Er... y-yes. Yes, quite.

Thank you!

So, this camera on the lake takes a photo whenever it hears an explosion sound?
Maya:
That's what she said.
Grossberg:
And it just happened to be set up on the beach, pointing out on the lake?

The DL-6 Incident (appears after presenting Misty Fey's Photo)







Edgeworth:
The "DL-6 Incident"... was when my father died. Right before my eyes... He was shot and killed, and I saw it all.
Maya:
...!
Edgeworth:
My memories from that time are... foggy. I suppose it's a self-defense mechanism. In any case, a suspect was arrested... a man. It's pretty clear he was the only one who could have killed my father. The spirit medium they used to talk to my late father said the same thing. It was an attorney by the name of Robert Hammond that cleared the suspect's name.
Phoenix:
And Hammond... is the victim in the Gourd Lake murder?
Edgeworth:
Correct.
Maya:
Umm... That spirit medium... that was my mom.
Edgeworth:
What? You mean you're...? ... It's strange. I thought that terrible incident was about to end, and now... this.
Phoenix:
"About to end"?
Edgeworth:
The DL-6 Incident happened 15 years ago. 15 years ago... on December 28.
Maya:
December 28?
Edgeworth:
The statute of limitations on the case runs out in three days.
Phoenix:
What!?
Maya:
Um, Nick? What does that mean?
Phoenix:
When a case's statute of limitations runs out, legally, the case never happened.
Edgeworth:
Three days from now, DL-6 will be closed... forever.




The suspect (appears after "The DL-6 Incident")







Maya:
What happened to the suspect? The one who got off innocent?
Edgeworth:
I don't know... He disappeared from public view. Nobody knows where to. If he's still alive, he'd be about 50 years old now.
Phoenix:
(I guess I can understand why he'd go into hiding... It'd be hard to live a normal life after being a murder suspect in such a big case.)




Your father (appears after "The DL-6 Incident")







Maya:
Umm... so, was your father a lawyer?

Phoenix:
About the "DL-6 Incident"...
Edgeworth:
Right... DL-6. I didn't want you to find out about it. That is why I refused your offer to defend me. I'm sorry if it sounded like I thought you weren't up to the job. I just wanted to keep you away from DL-6.
Phoenix:
So... do you still think it would have been better for me to stay away?

Phoenix:
Right. I saw it too... But you really can't tell from the photo who it is shooting.

She can do that!?

I'm afraid tomorrow is going to be life or death for poor Mr. Edgeworth. We got a witness who says she saw the very moment of the murder. And we got a photo taken when the shot rang out.

Karma...? (ellipsis and question mark highlighted in the original release)Edgeworth:
That's right, Manfred von Karma. He's the best prosecutor there is. He hasn't lost a case in his 40-year career. He is a god of prosecution, Wright! A god!Maya:
Not a single case?Edgeworth:
He'll do anything to get a guilty verdict, anything.Phoenix:
Hmm. Sounds like someone else I know, Edgeworth.Edgeworth:
Hmph. You don't understand. I mean he'll really do anything. Manfred von Karma is a man to be feared.Phoenix:
(That's quite a claim coming from someone who forges evidence...)Edgeworth:
He taught me what it really means to "prosecute."Phoenix:
Wh-what!?Edgeworth:
Just picture a prosecutor as vicious as me... multiplied by a factor of ten.Maya:
Ugh... So... so was he your teacher, then, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:
Something like that...Maya:
And now he's trying to get you found guilty!? What a creep! Oh, wait... Maybe he's planning on losing on purpose to help you out.Edgeworth:
Not a chance... He hasn't lost once in 40 years. 40 years! He's as ruthless as me, times twenty!Maya:
That's pretty ruthless...Edgeworth:

Describe the incident. Now!Gumshoe:
Y-yessir!Phoenix:
(Detective Gumshoe looks nervous...)Gumshoe:
Er, please take a look at the map. The murder happened late Christmas Eve, around midnight. There was one boat in the very middle of the lake. There were two men on the boat. Now, there happened to be a woman camping here on the edge of the lake. At 12:10 AM, she heard two pistol shots. Then the boat started to move. It went towards the boat rental shop.Karma:
Hmm.Overhead Map added to the Court Record.Karma:
Testify to the court about your arrest. Now!Judge:
W-w-wait! Mr. von Karma...Karma:
Yes?Judge:
Actually, I'm the one that's supposed to be handling these proceedings...Karma:
Wrong. There is only one thing you need to do here. You will slam down your gavel and say the word "guilty." That is your role!Judge:
Y-yes, of course. You're quite right.Phoenix:

Was the bullet found in the body fired from this pistol?Gumshoe:
Yes. The ballistic markings on the bullet match the pistol.Judge:
Hmm...Maya:
Hey, Nick! What does he mean, "ballistic markings"?Karma:
Shocking! To imagine someone here does not know something as basic as ballistic markings!Maya:
N-Nick! He's glaring at me!Karma:
Tsk... very well, I'll explain. Actually, Judge! You do it.Judge:
Eh? M-me? ... Erm, ahem. Ballistic markings are like the "fingerprints" of a gun. The barrel leaves distinctive marks on each bullet it fires. You can examine these "ballistic fingerprints" to see which gun fired the shot. It's quite accurate.Karma:
Indeed. This leads to one, inevitable conclusion: the bullet found in the victim's heart... was, without a doubt, fired from this pistol. This pistol which, as you may recall, was covered with the defendant's own fingerprints!Judge:
O-order! Order!Phoenix:

I'd say it's almost decisive, yes. Honestly, I could declare a verdict at this point. However...Karma:

Er... very well. Your testimony, please.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Lotta:
It was Christmas Eve, just after midnight, I reckon.
I was in my car.
I heard this "bang" come up from the lake.
When I looked out the window, I saw two gents in a boat.
Then there was another "bang"...
There wasn't nary a thing on the lake but that boat.Karma:
Enough.Lotta:
Huh?Karma:
Judge! She happened to take a photo of the incident! This is that photo. Accept it as evidence.Judge:
W-well! This is a surprise! This looks like... the very moment of the murder! O-Order! I will remove you from the court if I do not have order immediately!Karma:
As the witness testified, she looked at the lake when she heard the shot. There were no other boats on that lake! So, the man in the boat with the victim must have been the one who shot him... Yes. It was the defendant, Miles Edgeworth!!!Judge:
Order! Order! Order...! I will have order!Karma:
... Well, Judge?Judge:
The evidence is... decisive. I have very little doubt about this case. Very well, this court finds the defendant...Phoenix:Phoenix:
W-wait! Your Honor! I haven't cross-examined the witness yet!Karma:
A cross-examination? We have photographic proof! What question can there possibly be!? This photo is worth a thousand words... and they all read "guilty"! You lose. Or... Do you claim to have found a contradiction in her testimony!?Phoenix:

Very well. If you have to, you may cross-examine the witness. You will only flounder and ask meaningless questions! You will fail to find anything! And then, I will have you held in contempt of court!Maya:
Uh, Nick... contempt...?Phoenix:

Honestly, I found nothing.
Maya:
I dunno, I thought her testimony was strange. She was so vague about everything!
Phoenix:
I bet von Karma probably fed her her lines.
Maya:
But... But if you don't cross-examine her, the judge will...
Phoenix:
He'll bang down that "flimsy gavel" of his and declare Edgeworth guilty.

I guess we'll just have to bluff it.

I was looking right at that boat, the whole time, cross my heart and hope to fry.Judge:
Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.Karma:Karma:
The witness's testimony is unchanged from before! Whether she is a research student or a photographer has no bearing on this case! There is no need to waste more of our time with another pointless cross-examination!Judge:
Er... hmm.Phoenix:Phoenix:
I claim the defense's right to cross-examine the witness, Your Honor! (von Karma's up to something, I know it! He doesn't want me to cross-examine her because... why? Was there a contradiction?)Judge:
Very well. You may begin the cross-examination. You seem sure of yourself, you must have something in mind.Karma:
Hah! That would be a first!Phoenix:
(Hah hah, very funny.)Judge:
You understand that this is your last chance at a cross-examination, Mr. Wright? If there is no problem with the testimony this time, we will let the witness leave. I will announce my verdict at that time, Mr. Wright. Understood?Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.Cross Examination-- Lotta's New Testimony --Lotta:

Phoenix:
Then what manner of person are you!?
Lotta:
I'm not sure I'm high-falutin' enough to be called a "manner" of anything.Lotta:
I'm an investigative photographer.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
An "investigative photographer"?
Lotta:
Yep. You get your photo, and sell it to the press. It's that kind of business. Hey, I was taking pictures at my sister's graduation last year... N' guess what!
Phoenix:
Umm... what?
Lotta:
There was a yoofoh just a' hanging in the sky!
Phoenix:
A "yoofoh"...?
Lotta:
You know, an "Unidentified Flying Object"? A yoofoh! That's when I had sort of a revelation. I knew I should become an investigative photographer!
Phoenix:
I... I see. (Kind of a shaky basis for a career...)Lotta:
Imagine what a scoop it'd be if I got a picture of that monster!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Is "Gourdy" really all that newsworthy?
Lotta:
Heck yeah! They even had him up on the TV!
Phoenix:
(I'm not sure that appearing on the local news "rumor of the month" show qualifies. Last month's show was "Bigfoot Sighted on Acorn Hill," I believe.)
Lotta:
Hey! They also had a picture of him in the newspaper! For real!
Judge:
Mr. Wright. This is one fight I do not believe you can win. Let's keep moving, shall we?
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.Lotta:
That's why I was camping out by the lake.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
That's why you put the automatic senior on your camera?
Lotta:
Yep. Borrowed it from a friend at a university. It analyzes every sound it picks up, and when it gets a "bang!"...
Phoenix:
It snaps a shot.
Lotta:
Yep.
Phoenix:
So, how many pictures has it taken so far?
Lotta:
The only time the camera triggered was that night.
Phoenix:
(Hmm...)Lotta:
But, that's all I was hiding.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
I think it's time you told us why you felt you had to hide your true purpose at the lake.
Lotta:
Heck, if word got out what I was up to, the lake'd be swarmin' with competitors!
Phoenix:
Competitors...?
Lotta:
Yeah! Second-rate shutterbugs trying to steal my scoop!
Phoenix:
Ah... Is that the only reason you were hiding the truth?
Lotta:
W-well, actually...

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Exactly what sort of sound was it?

Well, I never heard one before so I can't say for sure... but it sounded like a gunshot. It was a lot sharper a sound than I would have expected.

What? What did I do now? What're you giving me that look for?

Huh? Wait, so you're thinking maybe he was shot from some other place? I don't think so, nope. The lake was smooth as glass, and nobody was on the shore, neither.
Phoenix:

Phoenix:

"Ms. Hart!"Phoenix:
(I'd better find some sort of contradiction in this testimony... I won't be able to beat von Karma any other way... There has to be something!)Phoenix:
Ms. Hart! Were you REALLY looking at that boat!?Lotta:
W-what's with you!? Course I was looking at it! It was the only thing out there! Any normal person'd be looking at it!Phoenix:
I agree, any normal person would. But you are far from normal!Lotta:
Wh-what!? Y'all wanna step over here and say that!?Phoenix:
You were camping at the lake to take a picture of Gourdy! Think about it-- What would you do if you heard a loud noise? You'd be scanning the lake for any sign of Gourdy, that's what! You wouldn't give the boat a second thought!Lotta:
Aah!Judge:
Order! Continue, Mr. Wright!Phoenix:
You testified that you were watching the boat through binoculars! However, you wouldn't need binoculars to watch that boat! You needed them to search for Gourdy... and that's what you were doing!Lotta:
...! ... ...Phoenix:
Well!?Lotta:
Hmph... Well, now that y'all mention it... I did sort of take my binoculars and kind of scan the lake a bit... I mean, Gourdy might be out there, n' all...Judge:
M-Ms. Hart! A-are you saying that you were NOT watching the boat, then?Lotta:
... S-sorry, y'all. I wasn't fibbing, really. I was, just... I thought y'know, I could be witness to a murder n' all! I kinda got excited. I was sure I was watching that boat... till now.Judge:
... This... this is totally uncalled for--Lotta:
B-but hey! You got the photograph! You got proof!Judge:
Hmm... Still, we can't see who is shooting who in this.Lotta:

(What was she going to say? She took the photo... and what? Wait a second...)Gumshoe:
She even had a photograph to prove it.Phoenix:
But you really can't tell from the photo who is shooting.Gumshoe:
That's why she said she's going to enlarge the photo. She said "it'll drop the quality a mite, but should let us see who's who!"Phoenix:
(She enlarged that photo! Why won't von Karma let her show it? I've got a hunch! I bet that enlarged photo shows something bad for von Karma! This is my chance! If I'm wrong, though, it'll mean prison for Edgeworth... or worse. What should I do!?)Make her show the enlargement







Leads to:
"Ms. Hart! Look at this photograph."Wait and see what happens







Phoenix:
(If this is a trap... I'd better hold back and see how things go. But... if I wait now, the cross-examination will be over! Can I really risk that!?)



Do nothing







Judge:
This hereby ends the cross-examination of Ms. Lotta Hart.
Karma:
And none too soon. That was a flagrant waste of my time.
Judge:
Mr. von Karma, do you have anything to add?
Karma:
I stated everything I needed to when this trial began. Decisive evidence. A decisive witness. What else could possibly be required?
Judge:
Nothing, of course.
Phoenix:
(Oh no! I should have pressed further!)
Judge:
This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court find the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth...

Guilty

Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!

Y-yeah! I did!Phoenix:
Why has that enlargement not been presented to the court!?Karma:Karma:
B-because it does not exist!Lotta:
What're y'all talking about!? You were the one who told me not to show it in court in the first place! You old fool!Judge:

Y-yes, Your Honor! Right away!
Leads back to:
"I'll show you the evidence that left hand contradicts!"Phoenix:
The evidence is clear. The man in this photograph is holding that pistol in his left hand. However! The prints on the murder weapon were from Edgeworth's "right hand"! Ergo! The man shooting the pistol in this photograph... Is not Mr. Edgeworth!!!Judge:
Now that everyone in the courtroom has quieted down... I would like to reconvene this court of law! Mr. Wright.Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.Judge:
You have given us definitive proof today. We now know that it was not Mr. Edgeworth who fired the pistol that night. However... This leaves us with a rather large problem. If Mr. Edgeworth didn't do it, then who shot our victim?Karma:
Precisely! As we have seen, there were no other people on the lake that night! Who but the defendant could have shot the victim!?Ms. Hart







Phoenix:
Who else but the witness, Ms. Lotta Hart!
Judge:
Wh-what!? Do you have proof of this!?
Phoenix:
(Proof-shmoof! Always with the proof! Oh... wait, I do need proof, don't I.)
Judge:
Mr. Wright! I'll have you remember this is a court of law!

Well, Wright! Your answer!

"Who but the defendant could have shot the victim!?"Phoenix:
There is only one explanation remaining! The man who shot the victim was none other than... the victim himself!!!Judge:
Order! Order! So... you are saying that the victim committed suicide?Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. I can think of no other explanation.Judge:
Hmm... Indeed, that does seem to be the only remaining option.Karma:Karma:
I'm so very, very sorry, Mr. Wright. But suicide is out of the question.Phoenix:
Wh-what!?Karma:
An examination of the victim's wound reveals the distance at which he was shot.Phoenix:
The... distance?Karma:
The victim was clearly shot from further than a meter away!Phoenix:
A meter! Th-that's three feet!Karma:
There is no way it could have been suicide!Judge:
Order! Order! Mr. von Karma! Are you sure of the accuracy of your data!?Karma:
Of course! I had already considered the possibility of suicide, you see.Autopsy Report updated in the Court Record.Judge:
Hmm... I see. Very well, allow me to state my opinion. Considering the situation, the shooter had to be the defendant, Mr. Edgeworth. However! The prints on the gun reveal that the shooter was not Mr. Edgeworth. This is a conundrum. Therefore, I would like to suspend proceedings for this trial for the day.

No. I have yet to be declared innocent, Wright.Phoenix:
Well, yeah, but... What happened out there on that lake, anyway!? If he didn't commit suicide, then who...? The shooter was about a meter away, too!Edgeworth:
... W-what? Don't give me that look! I did not kill him!Phoenix:
I was just kidding around.Edgeworth:
Hmph.Phoenix:
Look... I'm going to go check on Maya.Edgeworth:
Oh... Wright.Phoenix:
What?Edgeworth:
Tell her something for me.Phoenix:
What?Edgeworth:

Well, you did save the trial... Just, behave from now on, okay?Maya:
O... Okay.Talk









Questioning







Phoenix:
Have you been questioned yet?
Maya:
No... not yet. Detective Gumshoe was here just now. He said "seeing as this is your first offense, we'll let you go after questioning."
Phoenix:
Whew...
Maya:
Oh, and he wanted me to get bail money ready. You can pay for me, okay?
Phoenix:
Huh? How much?
Maya:
I don't know. I guess they'll send you a bill or something.
Phoenix:
(Why do I picture giant bales of money every time I hear the word "bail"?)




Mia







Phoenix:
Any luck with Mia...?
Maya:
None... I can't get through to her at all. I tried... I really did! I don't know what to do... ... I think I probably shouldn't have stopped my training.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... she sounds like she really did do her best. I should check and see if there are any waterfalls in the local area...)
Maya:
I wonder if I'll ever see my sister again...Present









Attorney's Badge







Maya:
It must be nice, Nick. You can just show that to anyone and say "I'm a lawyer!" But, spirit mediums, well...
Phoenix:
I dunno, with your clothes, I bet at least some people would recognize you...
Maya:
But these are medium-in-training clothes... I wonder if I'll ever be a proper medium...




Lake Photo







Maya:
Isn't that the enlarged photo Lotta was talking about?
Phoenix:
Uh huh.
Maya:
Huh... It's nice and big... but you can't really see the faces any clearer, can you?




Misty Fey's Photo







Maya:
My... mother. ...
Phoenix:
(Now that I've shown her the picture, I'm not so sure it was the right thing to do. No... I'm pretty sure it was the wrong thing to do.)




Gourdy Article







Maya:
I want to see Gourdy, too!
Phoenix:
If he really exists.
Maya:
Well, I'd say a photograph is pretty good proof! Once this trial is over, let's get some fishing poles and go down to the lake!
Phoenix:
(Even if there is a monster in that lake, fishing poles sound like a BAD idea...)




Pistol Bullet







Maya:
So the markings on this bullet and the barrel of the pistol matched?
Phoenix:
Hey, I'm surprised you remembered that!
Maya:
How could I forget after von Karma rubbed it in so much? So, which one of these are the ballistic markings?
Phoenix:
I'm... not really sure.




Pistol







Maya:
Mr. Edgeworth's prints are on this pistol, aren't they?
Phoenix:
Yes... the prints from his right hand. But they must have gotten on there at some other time other than the shooting.
Maya:
What? Really!?
Phoenix:
(The shooter used his left hand, after all...)

Detective







Phoenix:
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
Police:
"Don't do anything rash! Why jump...? ...You have every reason to live!"
Phoenix:
... He must be doing image training for talking down a potential suicide.




Chief







Phoenix:
This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen.
Chief:
Wha...!? Rook to Bishop 7... Checkmate!? I don't believe it!

Bookshelf







Phoenix:
Expensive-looking mahogany bookshelves, filled with expensive-looking books. Hmm... funny... they don't look like they've ever been read.




Desk







Phoenix:
A solid mahogany desk. The wood's been polished to a deep luster.




Vacant wall







Phoenix:
I guess Mr. Grossberg isn't getting that painting back. I feel kind of bad for him...




Potted plant







Phoenix:
An expensive potted plant. No idea what kind of plant it is, but it's probably the most expensive one available.




Table







Phoenix:
A table for clients. Hmm... an elegant ebony case, and if I'm not mistaken, that lighter's made of solid gold. Even I can tell someone here's got money to burn.December 26Gourd Lake ParkEntrancePhoenix:
There are fewer than there were yesterday, but the cops are still around in the park. I wonder if Detective Gumshoe is here today?Examine









Trees







Phoenix:
I feel winter's chill from the bare leaf trees today... There's a lot of trees here. I guess that's why they call it a "nature park." It's quite pretty when the cherry trees along the lakeside blossom in spring. Today... it's just cold.




Sign







Phoenix:
The sign says "Gourd Lake Nature Park." This place is full of families picnicking on the weekend. It's a little cold for picnicking these days, though.December 26Gourd LakePublic BeachPhoenix:
Haven't seen Larry around at all. Probably off paying through the nose on a date with the lovely Kiyance...Examine









Lake







Phoenix:
The famous Gourd Lake... Its green waters stretch out on both sides... It's a pretty big lake, really.December 26Boat Rental ShopPhoenix:
(Looks like the boat rental shop is closed today, too.)Examine









Shop







Phoenix:
A small boat rental shop. Doesn't look like anyone is around. They're probably closed because of the murder.




Boats







Phoenix:
There are some boats floating at the dock. The murder took place in a boat from this dock... Apparently, the police took away the actual boat that was used that night. Indeed, there's space for one more boat at the dock.December 26Gourd Lake WoodsPhoenix:
Hey, Detective Gumshoe!Gumshoe:
Hey, pal! The trial today, it, er... ...Phoenix:
Yes? What about the trial?Gumshoe:
Well, I was going to say "good show," but it wasn't really all that... Though you did save Mr. Edgeworth, I guess... (Changed from [Though you did save Edgeworth, I guess...] in the original release) I just wasn't sure how to thank you... you know?Phoenix:
Er... thanks.Examine









Camera







Phoenix:
Lotta's camera is staring out at the lake, as usual. Even a novice like me can tell that camera must cost a pretty penny. I hope she doesn't leave it out here to get stolen.




Sign







Phoenix:
The sign says "No Camping." Funny place to pick to pitch your tent.




Campfire







Phoenix:
I wonder why she brought a camping cooker with her? There's a convenience store right up the street... I guess she wanted to get into the outdoor spirit.




SUV







Phoenix:
I don't think Lotta takes very good care of her SUV. It's covered with dents. I can't believe anyone would drive their car down here.Talk









Tomorrow's trial







Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe? Any idea what strategy von Karma is planning for tomorrow?
Gumshoe:
It sounds like he's bringing in another witness!
Phoenix:
Another witness!? Oh, right, he said something about that in the trial today...


Karma:
There were two witnesses!


Phoenix:
I was wondering who that other witness was! Er... who was it?
Gumshoe:
S... sorry, pal. As much as I'd like to, I'm not at liberty to divulge that information.
Phoenix:
(Right...)




Prosecutor Edgeworth







Phoenix:
Oh, right... I wanted to ask you something about Edgeworth.
Gumshoe:
What's up?
Phoenix:
Is he afraid of earthquakes? I never heard anything about that before.
Gumshoe:
... Mr. Edgeworth doesn't talk about himself too much, see. But there's one thing that's clear as day... Him hating crime the way he does... And him becoming a lawyer... And him being scared of earthquakes... It all started with that incident.
Phoenix:
The DL-6 Incident?
Gumshoe:
Yep, that's the one. Fifteen years ago... when he saw his father shot before his very eyes! He still feels the pain now, you can see it in his eyes.




Maya Fey







Phoenix:
I wanted to talk to you about Maya Fey...
Gumshoe:
Huh? She's not out on bail yet? That's strange. I told 'em to let her go as soon as they had their report written up. Man... I don't know what would have happened in that courtroom today if it weren't for her. Seeing her getting dragged out by the bailiff... I'll be honest with you, pal. I shed a tear or two. Mr. Edgeworth, he was so moved I saw his lip trembling. (Changed from [Edgeworth, he was so moved I saw his lip trembling.] in the original release)
Phoenix:
Really!? (Cold-as-ice Edgeworth!?)
Gumshoe:
He was really grateful for what she did, you know.Present









Attorney's Badge







Gumshoe:
I think it's a little early for you to be proudly waving that thing around. You can be proud of yourself when you get Mr. Edgeworth declared innocent, pal!




Lotta's Camera







Gumshoe:
That woman really took us for a ride, didn't she? Claiming she was a witness to a murder and all...
Phoenix:
Still, if it weren't for her photograph, Mr. Edgeworth wouldn't have made it today.
Gumshoe:

Robert's Autopsy Report







Gumshoe:
Robert Hammond... He was the defense attorney in the DL-6 Incident trial. He's the one who got the sole suspect off the hook. I wonder what Mr. Edgeworth thinks of him. Not much, I'd wager.




Lake Photo







Gumshoe:
I don't care who you are, no one can tell me that that's Mr. Edgeworth! I mean, come on, it doesn't look like him at all!
Phoenix:
But Edgeworth has admitted he was on the boat.
Gumshoe:
Then he's the one being shot, then!
Phoenix:
He seemed fine in court today...
Gumshoe:
... Details, pal, details! Whose side are you on, anyway?
Phoenix:
(All I'm saying is we have to respect the evidence...)




Pistol Bullet







Gumshoe:
Yep, it was fired from the murder weapon, without a doubt.
Phoenix:
From a meter away... so it would have to have been from someone else on the boat.
Gumshoe:
Hmm...
Phoenix:
What do you make of this, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
Hey, making something of things is your job!
Phoenix:
Er... right. (Since when do lawyers have to do detectives' work for them!?)




Pistol







Gumshoe:
Maybe you should tell me why Mr. Edgeworth's prints were on the weapon, pal.
Phoenix:
Huh? How should I know!?




Lotta's Deposition







Gumshoe:
Now, she heard two gunshots, right?
Phoenix:
But wait... Look at the Court Record! According to this, the murder weapon was fired three times!
Gumshoe:
What!? How's that possible!?
Phoenix:
Where was the third shot fired?
Gumshoe:
I wonder... Maybe it was a practice shot or something?




Anything else

Thank you. Oh, wait! Umm... I was wondering, how much is bail going to be?Gumshoe:
Don't worry about that. Mr. Edgeworth is posting the whole amount.Phoenix:
What? Edgeworth...?Gumshoe:
Didn't I tell you? He's grateful to her for what she did. Alright, pal. Well don't forget to go pick her up, okay?Phoenix:

Well, they let you out in the end, didn't they?Maya:
Mmm... Oh, that reminds me... Thanks for bail.Phoenix:

Mr. Edgeworth did that...? ... I have to make it up to him! We've got to win this case, Nick!Talk









What to do







Phoenix:
What do you think we should do next?
Maya:
We're kind of lacking in the clues department. We could go to the park and look for Gourdy.
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
I-I was kidding!
Phoenix:
Still, if there are any clues out there, the park's as good a bet as any. What do you say? Shall we head down there?
Maya:
Sure!

Phoenix:
Have you noticed anything lately?
Maya:
Hmm... You know, I did notice one thing while I was here in detention. It's really pretty comfortable here. It's warm, and they keep it very clean.

Today's trial







Phoenix:
What did you think of the trial?
Lotta:
To be honest, I was doin' it half just to say I'd been a witness... Even though I didn't really see anything. I kinda convinced myself I had though... I'm sorry, I know I caused y'all a lot of trouble.
Maya:
Well, memory is a tricky, vague little thing.
Lotta:
Yeah, I sure know that now. I'll be fine the next time I witness a murder!
Maya:
Right!
Phoenix:
(You mean the FIRST time you witness a murder...)




Gourdy

What about Gourdy?
Lotta:
Right! Well, the way I figure, the trial's only stoking the flames of Gourdy fever! I'll get my exclusive photos and rocket to stardom!

Making it up







Phoenix:
Lotta, what do you mean by "making it up to us"?
Lotta:
Well, ya see... Actually, I got a bit of information for you.
Maya:
What!?
Lotta:
That von Karma didn't want me to say nothin' about it.
Maya:
Wh-what information!?
Lotta:
Now we're getting to the heart of it! See, I reckoned we might be able to do ourselves a little "exchange."
Phoenix:
E-"exchange"? Umm... I thought this was to "make it up to us"...?
Lotta:
Right! I propose a little exchange, to make it up to you!
Phoenix:

Lotta:
What!? Information don't come cheap, my friend!

Maya:
Wh-what should we do, Nick?



Deal







Phoenix:
(We don't have any other leads so I don't think we have a choice here...) Okay. How much?
Lotta:
Huh? You completely off your rocker? I may not be sophisticated, but I'm not trying to rob the poor!
Leads to:
"Huh?"




No deal







Phoenix:
I'm sorry... But I've no intention of dealing with you!

Maya:
Umm... uh... You know, I was wondering...
Lotta:
Yeah?
Maya:
What if you get a picture of Gourdy... and it turns out like this enlargement did?
Lotta:
Y'all crazy!? A blurry picture like this doesn't make a hit story! I need a picture that screams "I am Gourdy! Hear me roar!" I can't turn something like this into the paper! What kind of fool do y'all think I am?
Phoenix:

Flags







Phoenix:
Those flags look sadly out of place here. Flapping listlessly back and forth in a cold wind under a cold sky...

I dunno, I think it kind of gives the place a festival atmosphere. It reminds me of the "War of the Eyeglasses"!

Hey, Larry, did you know Edgeworth's secret weakness? He's terrified of earthquakes! He acts like a little boy!
Butz:
Huh? That's weird. I don't think he was ever like that in school.
Maya:
No? Really?
Butz:
Well, we were only in the same class for a year. He transferred schools pretty quickly...

Detective







Phoenix:
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
Police:
"Resistance is futile! We have you surrounded! It's not too late... Release the hostages and come out with your hands up."

The flying air tank (after selecting "Is it yours?", then "To inflate something", then "Ask more about the tank" upon presenting Air Tank)







Maya:
Umm... So, the tank and the Steel Samurai you were trying to fill up flew away... What happened next?
Butz:
Well, all that happened on the 20th or so.
Phoenix:
(The 20th... a week ago.)
Butz:
Now, as far as I could see, the tank went flying out into the lake. So I went out every night in a boat looking for it. I mean, Kiyance gave me that Steel Samurai after all!
Maya:
And when did you find it?
Butz:
Just the night before last! It flew way out there! Took me four whole days to find it.
Phoenix:
(The night before last... was the night of the murder!)
Butz:
Sorry for not telling you, Nick. Actually, I was here on the night of the murder. But, you see, I went home before midnight.
Maya:
So you didn't know about what happened?
Butz:
No...
Maya:
That's too bad...
Phoenix:
It's not all bad. We've solved one mystery at least.
Maya:
A mystery...?
Phoenix:
(Maybe we should go tell her...)Present









Air Tank







Butz:
What? An air tank? What about it?
Phoenix:
Larry... I wanted to ask you about this tank...



Have you seen it before?







Phoenix:
Have you seen this before?
Butz:
Huh? Me? N-no. Never. Who the heck would go diving in the middle of the winter!
Phoenix:
(There's something about the way his eye twitched when I showed him the tank... I think I'd better pursue this line of questioning a little further...)
Leads back to Court Record




Is it yours?







Phoenix:
Say... is this air tank yours?
Butz:
Wh-why would I have a thing like that?
Phoenix:
Look--see how there's a string of flags around the tank valve? It's just like the string of flags around your Steel Samurai there.
Butz:
...! M-must be a coincidence! There's strings of flags everywhere these days! L-like elementary schools! A-and used car dealerships! L-look, why would I need a tank anyway!?



To inflate something







Phoenix:
You used this to inflate that, didn't you?
Butz:
I-inflate what!?
Phoenix:
What else? That big puffy Steel Samurai!
Butz:
!!! ... N-now why would you go asking me a question like that.
Phoenix:
(Looks like I hit the nail on the head.)
Butz:
... Right... right... Actually, umm... See, the compressor I always use was on the fritz. So I tried using the tank to inflate it, just once. And, er, it didn't go so well.
Phoenix:
(As I suspected!)



Put the tank away







Phoenix:
(I guess I've gotten to the bottom of that mystery!)
Butz:
Heh. Sorry!
Leads back to Court Record




Ask more about the tank







Phoenix:
It "didn't go so well"?
Butz:
Er, yeah.
Phoenix:
Do you think you could be a little more specific?
Butz:
C-c'mon...  Look, it's embarrassing so I really don't want to talk about it...
Maya:
Tell us! Tell us!
Butz:
... Fine. Whatever. It's like what I said, the compressor was busted. So I took the tank and tried to fill the Samurai up with that. And then...


BLAAAAM!

Butz:
The valve busted open and made this incredible noise! And that tank there took off like a rocket. And it took my poor deflated Steel Samurai with it!
Maya:
What!? Off into Gourd Lake?
Butz:
It sure scared me out of my gourd, that's for sure.
Adds Talk option "The flying air tank"





To go diving







Phoenix:
You used this to go diving in the lake, didn't you?
Butz:
Wh-wh-what!? Why the heck would I go diving in the lake!? Wait! You... you're not... You're not saying I had something to do with that murder!?
Phoenix:
N-no, not at all, just...
Butz:
Hey, you watch it buddy! I'm not saying anything until my lawyer gets here!
Maya:
Larry... Nick is your lawyer.
Phoenix:
Well, Larry? She's right.
Butz:
Bah! A-anyway, I never seen that air tank! Okay?
Phoenix:
(Yeah, right... Larry is hiding something, I can tell...)
Leads back to Court Record






Air Tank (after selecting "Is it yours?", then "To inflate something", then "Ask more about the tank" upon presenting Air Tank)







Butz:
See, I tried to use this tank to fill up the Samurai. I was attaching the tank, when it happened!


BLAAAAM!

Butz:
The valve just busted open and the whole thing took off! The tank shot up in the air like a rocket... And it took my poor deflated Steel Samurai with it! Man, what a sight that was.
Maya:
I wish I could have seen it!
Phoenix:
Me too.Gourd Lake WoodsTalk









Gourdy







Lotta:
Well, Mister Lawyer? I've got the info y'all need! Y'all got the scoop on Gourdy for me yet?



Nothing yet

Y-y'all for real!? Gourdy really exists!? Wait! I need proof! You get a photo!?



I have proof







Phoenix:
Of course I have proof.
Maya:
No fair, Nick! It was when I went to the bathroom, wasn't it!? That's when you made contact with Gourdy!
Lotta:
Enough jabbering already, let's see your proof!



Present Air Tank (after clearing "The flying air tank" Talk option in Gourd Lake - Public Beach)







Phoenix:

Maya:
Larry's air tank...?
Lotta:
What're y'all doing with an air tank?
Phoenix:
This... is Gourdy.
Lotta:
Umm... scuze me?
Maya:
Wh-what exactly are you saying, Nick?
Phoenix:
There's a stand near here... a hotdog stand. There's a giant inflatable samurai doll there. About a week ago, an idiot, who happens to be a friend of mine, tried to fill it. He used this air tank, and when the valve blew, the tank flew into the lake. Apparently, it made a pretty loud "bang" when it flew...
Lotta:
A "bang"...?
Phoenix:
The tank, along with the still deflated Samurai fell into the lake. At the same time... A couple was taking a photograph of the lake. This photo!
Maya:
Wait... So... you're saying that Gourdy... Is really the Steel Samurai!?
Lotta:
... ... Well, that's a fine way to ruin a gal's dreams.
Phoenix:
I'm sorry, Lotta.
Lotta:
Nah, it's okay, you win. I'll give you your info, like I promised.

Y'all got some proof Gourdy don't exist!?
Phoenix:
The proof that Gourdy doesn't exist...

Table







Maya:
Look, Nick, he has an electric blanket on his table! Looks warm! That's a great idea, we should do that at the office. We can sit down with our clients, snug and warm, and drink hot cocoa!

However... If you can convince me somehow that the DL-6 Incident is related to this case... Well, I guess I'd consider opening the file up.Present









Metal Detector







Phoenix:
Thanks, Detective Gumshoe. This was really helpful.
Gumshoe:
R-really?
Maya:
You seem surprised!
Gumshoe:
Huh? N-no, not at all. Glad it worked out for you.




Parrot







Gumshoe:
What's that? A parrot?
Phoenix:
The old man at the boat rental shop's parrot. The parrot knew about that "incident"...
Gumshoe:
That incident?
Phoenix:
DL-6.
Gumshoe:
Wh-what!?


Maya:
Polly! Polly! Have we forgotten something?
Parrot:
*squawk* "Don't forget DL-6!" *squawk*
Maya:
H-huh!?


Phoenix:
I'm pretty sure that old man must have taught her that word...
Gumshoe:
Yeah, but how would that old man know about the DL-6 Incident?
Phoenix:
Wait! What if... What if that old man was connected to DL-6?
Maya:
N-Nick! You think he might be!?
Gumshoe:
...After clearing all Talk options and presenting Parrot:Gumshoe:
... I get ya. Sounds like you need information on the DL-6 Incident. Through there is the Station's Records Room. I'll give you special permission to go in and find what you need.Maya:
All right! Way to go, Detective Gumshoe! Okay, Nick! To the Records Room!Phoenix:
(I guess it's time we faced Edgeworth's past...)December 26Police DepartmentRecords RoomMaya:
Wow!!! It's amazing.........ly dusty.Phoenix:
Ten years of files and ten years of dust, I guess.Maya:
Let's find that DL-6 stuff quick!Phoenix:
(Fifteen years ago... both me and Edgeworth were nine years old. We were almost through with fourth grade when he suddenly transferred. Because of DL-6...?)Maya:
Nick! I found out where the file is!Phoenix:
O-oh, thanks!Maya:
Just let me know what you want to know about the DL-6 Incident! I'll go get the right file!Examine









Glass case







Phoenix:
It looks like there are files inside that glass case. The case is so dusty I can't see what's inside.
Maya:
Nick... it's locked.
Phoenix:
They must keep important case files in there.




Back wall







Phoenix:
There are shelves stuffed with case files in the back of the room, too. Forgotten cases, rotting away for eternity...
Maya:
Nick, let's get what we need and get out of here. All this dust is getting to me!




Cabinet







Phoenix:
This cabinet is where they keep evidence for current cases. Some of the things are obviously murder weapons. Others are... who knows what. Most of it just looks like random junk.
Maya:
Nick... what do you think this clothespin is for?
Phoenix:
Don't touch that! It's evidence...




Shelves







Phoenix:
Here are files of collected case reports. There's quite a large volume of reports here.
Maya:
Wow... these are all case reports!?
Phoenix:
Yeah. It's like a graveyard of police cases.
Maya:
I guess my sister's case report is in here too... quietly gathering dust.Talk









The case summary







Phoenix:
Well, first I have to get a handle on the main facts... like a summary.
Maya:
Right. Summary... summary... Found it! Here you go.
Phoenix:
December 28... 2001.
Maya:
That's exactly 15 years ago from the day after tomorrow!
Phoenix:
(So in two days, the case is closed...) The incident took place in the elevator of the district courthouse. (Changed from [The incident took place in the elevator of the district court.] in the original release)
Maya:
What!? Is this the same district courthouse where we're holding the trial now!? (Changed from [Is this the same district court where we're holding the trial now!?] in the original release)
Phoenix:
Looks like it. There was a large earthquake at 2:00 PM on that day. Part of the court building collapsed, and all of the lights went out.
Maya:
Wow... that was some earthquake!
Phoenix:
At the time, three people were trapped in the elevator. It took five hours for them to be rescued... Five hours!
Maya:
That would be scary like that, in the dark!
Phoenix:
There was a lack of oxygen in the elevator, and the survivors were unconscious.
Maya:
The survivors...?
Phoenix:
One of the three in the elevator had been shot... in the heart.
Maya:
That was Mr. Edgeworth's father... wasn't it.
Phoenix:
(He said that his father was shot before his very eyes... So Miles Edgeworth was one of the other passengers in that elevator.)




Victim data







Phoenix:
Do you have data on the victim... Edgeworth's father?
Maya:
Yeah, hold on... Victim... victim... Here! Found it!
Phoenix:
Gregory Edgeworth, 35, defense attorney. If he were still alive, he'd be 50. He had lost that day's case in court, and got in the elevator with his son, Miles.
Maya:
"Miles"...!
Phoenix:
Miles Edgeworth, of course.
Maya:
So he was on the elevator with his father!
Phoenix:
From the angle of the bullet and the other evidence, it could not have been a suicide... The murder weapon, a pistol, was found in the elevator. The pistol had been fired two times. (Where have I heard that before...? Huh...! It sounds just like this current case! What's going on here?)




Suspect data







Phoenix:
Got any data on the suspect in there?
Maya:
Hmm... that would be the guy that my mom got arrested. Hold on... this is it.
Phoenix:
The man arrested as a suspect in DL-6 was... Yanni Yogi? He was a clerk in the court, apparently.
Maya:
So he must have been the third person in the elevator. Well, then he had to have done it!
Phoenix:
But... he was found innocent. Thanks to his defense lawyer, Robert Hammond.
Maya:
Hammond... the victim in our case!
Phoenix:
Right. The suspect, Mr. Yogi was oxygen deprived... so much so he had brain damage. He lost all memory of being in the elevator. After he was declared innocent, he disappeared.
Maya:
Hmm... where could Yogi have gone to, I wonder?
Phoenix:
(He may be closer than we think...)Present









Anything







Maya:
Let's just hurry up and read these files! This place is so dusty, I want to finish up and get out of here...After clearing all Talk options:Phoenix:
I guess I know generally what happened in DL-6 now. I still don't know what sort of impact the whole thing had on Edgeworth...Maya:
Nick. Are we going to take the whole file? There's too much! We'll never get it out.Phoenix:
Y-you're right. How about we just take what we think we'll need...DL-6 Case File added to the Court Record.Phoenix:
Right. That's probably all we'll be able to find here. Now, all that's left is the trial tomorrow... I wonder how "Dad" will do testifying in court...To be continued.Nothing to examine during investigation







Phoenix:
No clues here.Turnabout Goodbyes

Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Miles Edgeworth.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.Karma:
... ...Judge:
Very well, apparently the prosecution is also ready.Phoenix:
(Who is the judge here, anyway!?)Judge:
Mr. von Karma, your opening statement.Karma:
... ...Judge:
Er... very well, no opening statement so...Karma:Karma:
Not so fast, Judge! I was taking a meaningful pause before speaking!Judge:
R-right, of course.Karma:
A prediction! Today's trial will end three minutes from now!Judge:
Order... order! Mr. von Karma! What is the meaning of your statement just now!?Karma:Karma:
Bah! Must you question everything! It will be over in three minutes! We have no time to waste! I'll call my witness now!Judge:
R-right...Karma:
I call my witness... my decisive witness to the stand!Phoenix:
(It's that mysterious boat shop owner.)Karma:
Witness... state your profession.Uncle:
Mmph... zzzz... ... I, er, am the proprietor of the restaurant the "Wet Noodle" at Gourd Lake.Karma:
...Uncle:
And I, er, also rent boats.Karma:
The night of the incident, you were in the boat rental shop, correct?Uncle:
Er... ayup, yup I was.Karma:
Please testify.Phoenix:
(Wait a second... We still haven't heard who this old guy is!)Raise an objection







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Wait a minute!"Let it slide







Phoenix:
(On second thought, I guess it doesn't really matter.)
Maya:
Doesn't matter!? What are you thinking, Nick!? What if that old man had something to do with the DL-6 Incident? If we don't find out who he is, we won't be able to build a case here!
Phoenix:
(Hmm, she has a point.)
Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Wait a minute!"Phoenix:
Wait a minute! The witness hasn't stated his name yet!Karma:Karma:
Because I did not ask him, Mr. Wright! Bah! I have predicted this trial will end in three minutes! Stop asking trivial questions and cooperate!Phoenix:
(Yeah, right!)Judge:
The witness will state his name.Uncle:
Zzzz... ... Mmph! Well, er... I'm not really sure, ayup.Judge:
What do you mean?Uncle:
My, er, memory...Karma:
Your Honor... The witness does not remember anything beyond the last several years... Ergo, he cannot recall his own name.Judge:
Hmm... he can't recall, you say?Karma:
Yes, but the incident in question took place three days ago. He can testify.Judge:
Very well. Let's hear his testimony then, shall we. Witness?Witness Testimony-- The Night of the Murder --Uncle:
It was the night of the 24th, just after midnight, ayup.
I was in the restaurant... where I er... rent boats, as usual.
Then I heard a "bang!" Ayup.
When I looked out the window, I saw a boat just a' floating on the lake.
Then I heard another "bang."
Just about then the boat comes back to the shore, and a man walks by my window.Judge:
Hmm...Very well. I'd like to begin the cross-examination...Karma:Karma:
There is nothing to question in my witness's testimony! Ergo, no need for cross-examination! Besides, there are only 10 seconds left before our three minutes are up! Judge! Your verdict, now!Judge:
Er... yes... M-Mr. Wright...?Cross-examine







Phoenix:
What are you saying!? Of course I'll cross-examine the witness!
Judge:
Hmm... Very well, you may begin.
Leads to:
"Raaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!"Don't cross-examine







Phoenix:
(He's right. That testimony sounded pretty solid. Maybe I should hold back.)
Maya:
B-but, Nick! You have to cross-examine him! This is your only chance to turn this trial around! Your last chance!
Phoenix:
(O-oh... right.)
Leads to:
"Raaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!"Karma:
Raaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!Judge:
E-excuse me? Mr. von Karma?Karma:
Three minutes just passed.Judge:
I see. Well then, let's just take our time. You may cross-examine the witness.Cross Examination-- The Night of the Murder --Uncle:
It was the night of the 24th, just after midnight, ayup.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
"Just after midnight," you say?
Uncle:
Ayup, just around then.
Phoenix:
Are you sure?
Uncle:
Pretty sure, ayup.
Phoenix:
When I talked to you yesterday, you were rather vague about the time... I'm surprised you seem so sure about it today.
Uncle:
...
Karma:

Karma:
I asked him, and he remembered. Isn't that right!?
Uncle:
Zzzz... D-don't glare at me like that...! I, er... I remembered it clearly, I did. Ayup.
Karma:
You see? Continue!Uncle:
I was in the restaurant... where I er... rent boats, as usual.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Is there anyone who can verify that?
Uncle:
... Well, I guess Polly could.
Phoenix:
Th-that's not good enough for a court of law!
Judge:
Mr. Wright... exactly what's not good enough?
Phoenix:
Ah, uh, Your Honor, this "Polly" is a parrot.
Judge:
A... parrot?
Uncle:
Don't be so hard on the girl, Keithy-boy!
Judge:
Keith...?
Karma:

Karma:
The prosecution concedes that we cannot prove the witness was in the shop. Witness... please continue.Uncle:
Then I heard a "bang!" Ayup.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
And where did the "bang" seem to come from?
Uncle:
From the lake, I figure.
Karma:
Are you certain?
Uncle:
A-ayup.
Karma:
Good. Continue!Uncle:
When I looked out the window, I saw a boat just a' floating on the lake.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Was there someone in the boat?
Uncle:
It was pretty far out there... I couldn't see clearly... But I figure there was two men out there, ayup.
Phoenix:
But you couldn't see them clearly!
Uncle:
Ayup... at the time, that is.
Phoenix:
(At the time...?)Uncle:
Then I heard another "bang."Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So you heard two gunshots total?
Uncle:
Ayup.
Phoenix:
(That's what Lotta said in her testimony yesterday.)Uncle:
Just about then the boat comes back to the shore, and a man walks by my window.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
"By your window"?
Uncle:
Ayup, by my window. Right outside the window of my little shack.
Phoenix:
And, could you see the man's face?
Uncle:
Well, the fog was pretty darn thick, but he was right there in front of me. I saw him.
Judge:
This is rather important detail! Please add it to your testimony.
Uncle:
...
Karma:
Tsk, tsk, tsk...
Phoenix:
(I have a bad feeling about this...)
Adds statement "That man was the defendant... he was saying "I can't believe he's dead."Uncle:
That man was the defendant... he was saying "I can't believe he's dead."Press







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"A-are you sure!?"Phoenix:
(If I know von Karma, he spent time preparing his witness. I'm not going to find contradictions very easily in this testimony. Whew... it's tough being a lawyer.)Phoenix:
A-are you sure!?Uncle:
...Phoenix:
(Uh oh!) D-Dad!Uncle:
Dead certain, Keith! He said "I can't believe he's dead" as he was walking by, too.Karma:
Witness! Are you sure that the person you saw was Miles Edgeworth!?Uncle:
It was him! That Edgeworth boy!Judge:
... This... sounds like decisive evidence indeed. I see no room for doubt.Phoenix:
(von Karma... He lured me into cross-examining so he could set me up for a fall!)Karma:
Tsk, tsk, tsk...Maya:
N-Nick...! I don't like the way things are going here! Everyone in the courtroom is glaring at us!Phoenix:
(I'd better act quick, or this trial is going to be over!)Raise an objection







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Your Honor! We proved in yesterday's court that it could not have been Edgeworth who fired the gun!
Karma:

Karma:
Mr. Wright. Are you referring to the fingerprints from Edgeworth's right hand found on the gun, and the photograph showing a man firing with his left hand...?
Phoenix:
Exactly!
Karma:
That is easily explainable! He could have wiped his prints after he fired! You are ignoring the truth of the matter here! Everything in this witness's testimony is true!
Leads to:
"Hmm..."Wait and see what happens







Phoenix:
(But... how can I raise an objection without any proof?)
Karma:
Judge! There is no room for doubt in the witness's testimony! I demand that you declare your verdict!
Leads to:
"Hmm..."Judge:
Hmm...Phoenix:
(The judge is lost in thought... what should I do?)Raise an objection







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Your Honor! This witness claims that Edgeworth said "I can' t believe he's dead"... But his word is all we have! If he were telling a lie...
Karma:

Karma:
Mr. Wright. In a court of law, the evidence tells all. Apparently, you have yet to realize even this basic fact. If you say his testimony is a lie, show us proof!
Phoenix:
Urk...
Maya:
Nick! Do we have evidence...?
Leads to:
"It's no good! There's nothing I can do."Wait and see what happens







Phoenix:
(I can't see any room to raise an objection... I'd better hold back and see how things develop.)
Maya:
Nick! We have to do something! If we stay quiet now, Mr. Edgeworth'll be found guilty for sure!
Leads to:
"It's no good! There's nothing I can do."Phoenix:
It's no good! There's nothing I can do.Maya:
A... are you sure?Phoenix:
To be honest... I don't know what to do anymore.Maya:
Please... Can you hear me, Sis? Please... We need your help... Nick needs you...Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... Three minutes was perhaps too high an expectation. However, fifteen minutes isn't bad! This must be a new record.Judge:
Enough! The witness may leave the stand.Uncle:
Zzzz...Judge:
This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts.Phoenix:
(W-what!? No!)Karma:
Hmph.Judge:
This court find the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth...GuiltyJudge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!W-w-waaaaaaait!Judge:
Wh-who was that just now?Me!!!Phoenix:
Huh? Waaaaah! L-Larry!Judge:
Wh-what are you doing here!?Butz:
Listen! Y-you gotta listen to me! I... I was...  I was there, in the park, the night of the murder! I... I wasn't sure about it until just yesterday. B-but today I remembered it!Judge:
Remembered what?Butz:
The gunshot! I heard it too!Judge:
O-order!Karma:Karma:
What is the meaning of this!? The verdict has been decided! I call for adjournment!Judge:
One moment, Mr. von Karma. So, you say you heard a gunshot?Butz:
Yeah, I did! A gunshot! That night! I was sitting here in the audience, listening to the testimony... Then I realized, something he said was different from what I remember! A-anyhow, I can't just sit here and let you call Edgey a murderer! It's... It's just not right! I'll testify! Lemme testify!Judge:
Order! Order! Well, this is the first time something has happened like this in my court. I'm not quite sure how to proceed...Karma:
Judge! You've already given your decision! The trial is over!Maya:
Nick! This is it! Larry's given us one final chance at this!Phoenix:
(She's right! If only it wasn't Larry... He could make things even worse...)Maya:
Mr. Edgeworth was just declared guilty, Nick! It doesn't get any worse!Phoenix:
You're right! Okay! Your Honor! If there is another witness, it is our duty to hear him speak! Right here! Right now!Karma:
A waste of time! The verdict cannot be overturned!Judge:
Hmm... ... ... Allow me to speak my opinion. In all court proceedings, it is our duty to prevent an inaccurate verdict. In order to make sure no mistake has been made, every witness should be heard!Karma:
Wh-what is this!?Judge:
I withdraw my previous verdict of "guilty"! Mr. von Karma! I order you to call this new witness to testify. Now!Karma:
Whaaaat!Judge:
The court will adjourn for a five minute recess. After that, we will hear this new witness. Court is adjourned!December 27, 10:28 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2Phoenix:
Whew... That was too close. Sorry to keep you on the edge of your seat like that, Edgeworth.Edgeworth:
Hmph. I've seen worse.Phoenix:
(Yeah right, Edgeworth. You're sweating bullets!) I just wonder what Larry plans to say in there.Maya:
Larry was at the lake that night?Phoenix:
Yes... He said he went looking for the Steel Samurai balloon that flew into the lake.Maya:
Oh right. And he found the balloon and the air tank that night?Phoenix:
Yeah.Edgeworth:
...Phoenix:
Hey, Edgeworth.Edgeworth:
... Huh? You say something, Wright?Phoenix:
Yeah, a lot of things. You seem out of it. What's wrong?Edgeworth:
It... it's nothing.Phoenix:
Hmm?Maya:
Umm... Mr. Edgeworth? There's something I've been meaning to ask you.Edgeworth:
What's that?Maya:
Why are your fingerprints on the murder weapon?Edgeworth:
Oh. When he fell into the lake, I went into a daze. I couldn't understand what had happened. I couldn't think straight. Then I saw the pistol lying on the floor of the boat in front of me. I picked it up without thinking. I didn't have a reason, really.Maya:
I see...Edgeworth:
Wright...Phoenix:
Yeah?Edgeworth:
This might be our chance.Phoenix:
Our chance?Edgeworth:
von Karma has only ever run perfect trials.Phoenix:
Perfect trials...?Edgeworth:
Perfectly prepared witnesses, perfectly complete evidence. That's the secret to his success. This is the first time he's ever had to deal with something unexpected! He has to let someone he hasn't even talked to testify before the court! (Changed from [He has let someone he hasn't even talked to testify before the court!] in the original release) And that someone... is Larry!Phoenix:
What are you getting at?Edgeworth:
It's likely his testimony will be full of holes, Wright.Maya:
That's right, Nick! No ten minute trial this time! We'll milk this one for all it's worth!Phoenix:
Hey, it was fifteen minutes! Fifteen! (Everything's on Larry now...) (Changed from [Hey, it was fifteen minutes! Fifteen! (Everything depends on Larry now...)] in the original release)December 27, 10:35 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:
Court is now back in session. Witness... Please testify to the court about everything that you saw... on the night of December 24th.Butz:
Right... leave it to me!Phoenix:
(Please, Larry, don't mess this one up!!! I hate to admit it, but you're our last chance!)Karma:
...Phoenix:
(von Karma didn't even have time to prep his witness. I just hope Edgeworth is right about this being our big break...)Witness Testimony-- The Night of the Murder --Butz:
That night, I was out in a boat on the lake.
I was looking for something and I, er, found it.
So I quietly slipped the boat back in at the rental shop dock.
Then, just as I was thinking about going home, I heard this "bang"!
I looked out over the lake, but I didn't notice the boat.
So after I heard that single gunshot I went home.Judge:
Hmm... That was an unusually vague testimony, even for this court. In any matter, Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor...Maya:
What's wrong, Nick?Phoenix:
It's Larry! I have no idea what he's going to say if I press him. I'm a little scared.Maya:
Hmm... Well, we've come this far. There's no way to go but forward, Nick!Cross Examination

You can't imagine how much I've suffered...You... suffered?And now... the perfect opportunity presents itself. At last... I shall have my revenge!What!?...Merry Christmas.December 25, 10:08 AMWright & Co. Law OfficesMaya:
Hey, hey, Nick! Do you know if there's any good waterfalls around here?Phoenix:
Waterfalls...? Dare I ask why?Maya:
Duh, Nick! Isn't it obvious? I need a waterfall to stand under! Preferably a freezing one!Phoenix:
... Oh... Is that part of your spirit medium training?Maya:
Of course! Except, I've been slacking off lately... I need to brave the elements and be forged anew under the rushing spring waters!Phoenix:
Umm... Okay... I don't know about any falls per se, but Gourd Lake is pretty close...Maya:
Oh. Darn.Phoenix:
Sorry, but them's the breaks. Couldn't you just take a cold shower or something?Maya:
... Good idea!Phoenix:
(So much for the rushing spring waters...)TV:
Next in the news... A large, unidentified animal was sighted at Gourd Lake! The town is buzzing with excitement! Locals are calling it "Gourdy" in a tip of the hat to Nessie, the Loch Ness monster. Though its namesake, Nessie, proved to be a hoax... locals are confident their Gourdy is the real deal. ...Phoenix:
*yawn* Bor-ing. Can't they show real news for a change?Maya:
Nick?Phoenix:
?Maya:
The water pressure's kind of low in that shower.Phoenix:
... You want more pressure, huh? Why don't you go down to the fire department and have them spray you with the hose?Maya:
... Good idea, Nick!Phoenix:
(Apparently, Fey blood is no aid in detecting sarcasm...) (Changed from [Apparently, E.S.P. is no aid in detecting sarcasm...] in the original release)TV:
We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin! Strange occurrences continue at Gourd Lake... But this time, it's murder!Phoenix:
(Gourd Lake again?)TV:
The body of a man was found in the lake early this morning. A suspect was apprehended. Sources inside the police department revealed... that the suspect's name is Miles Edgeworth, age 24. Edgeworth was an up-and-coming prosecution attorney, known for his skill and connections. He was guaranteed a long and rewarding career... Has he thrown it all away?Phoenix:
(...? E-Edgeworth!?) What's going on!? Edgeworth would never do something like--Maya:
Nick?Phoenix:
Yipes! M-Maya!Maya:
The fireman yelled at me when I called him.Phoenix:
We've got bigger things to worry about than that! They arrested Edgeworth!Maya:
What? You mean, the prosecutor?Phoenix:
Yeah, he's a suspect... in a murder!Maya:
Whaaaaat!? When? Where? Whom? Why? How?Phoenix:
I-I don't know!Maya:
Let's go find out, Nick!Examine









Bookshelf







Phoenix:
Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. I tried reading one, and it made my head hurt. When I closed it, it slipped out of my hand. Then my foot hurt too.




Charley the plant







Phoenix:
Mia's favorite plant. Its name is "Charley." Maya's gotten the knack of watering it lately. Charley's been perking up these days.




Desk







Phoenix:
Mia's desk. If we had more clients, I would probably sit here more often. Lately, I've been spending more time on the couch, watching TV.




Movie poster







Phoenix:
Maya brought in a poster of the Steel Samurai the other day. We had a big fight over whether to put it up or not. I know she's just waiting for a chance to sneak it up on the wall.




Window







Phoenix:
Looks like it's cleaning day again at the hotel across the way. I hear they're planning a second branch outside the city. I can see the bellboy, getting the angle of that screwdriver in the drawer just right.Talk









What to do







Phoenix:
Well, what should we do?
Maya:
What do you mean!? Let's investigate! We should talk to Mr. Edgeworth, and check out the crime scene!
Phoenix:
(You're right... We need more information! Save aimlessness and confusion for later!)




Any ideas







Phoenix:
Well? Got any good ideas?
Maya:
Not really. I do my best thinking when I'm standing underneath a waterfall.Present









Attorney's Badge







Phoenix:
You know, I think it's developing a nice luster.
Maya:
I'll look at your badge later, Nick. We've got work to do!
Phoenix:
(I suppose you're right...)December 25Detention CenterVisitor's RoomMaya:
You know, Nick... We've all been in here one time or another, haven't we?Phoenix:
I guess it comes with the territory.Maya:
I'm not sure it's something we should mention to too many people... Aah!Phoenix:
... Hey! Edgeworth! Come back!Edgeworth:
What are you doing here!?Maya:
Nick, I don't think he's in a very good mood.Phoenix:
Well, he is in detention. Were you in a good mood when you were here?Edgeworth:
So, you've come to laugh at the fallen attorney? Then laugh, laugh! Well? Why aren't you laughing?Maya:
Nick... Should we be laughing?Phoenix:
Nah. It's a trick. Laugh and he'll get mad... or burst into tears. Edgeworth. We don't have so much free time we can spend it coming down here to laugh at you.Edgeworth:
... Yes you do.Phoenix:
(Actually, he's right.)Edgeworth:
... I hoped you wouldn't come. I didn't want you to see me. Not like this.Phoenix:
(I didn't want to see you like this, either. Believe me.) (Changed from [Hey, I didn't want to see you either, believe me.] in the original release)Examine









Surveillance camera







Phoenix:
Smile for the camera...




Security guard







Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch since I came in. A real pro. Or maybe he's just nervous with Edgeworth in the room.Talk









What happened







Phoenix:
Edgeworth. Tell me what happened.
Edgeworth:
... Why should I? What are you going to do about it?
Maya:
Duh! We're going to help you, that's what!
Edgeworth:
...! ... Help me? You? Don't be ridiculous.
Phoenix:
Sorry...?
Edgeworth:
You're a novice! You've only been in three trials!
Phoenix:
H-hey!
Edgeworth:
Sure, you got lucky and won all three... But your luck's bound to run out some day! You need real skill, Wright. Experience!
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
Nick! He's insulting you! Nick? Why am I always the one who has to get angry!?




Gourd Lake







Phoenix:
The murder took place at Gourd Lake, correct?
Edgeworth:
Yes... late last night.
Phoenix:
The lake is a long way away from your offices and the court... Why were you down there?
Edgeworth:
... I see no need to tell you.
Maya:
M-Mr. Edgeworth! You... you didn't really...?
Edgeworth:
... Gourdy.
Maya:
Huh?
Edgeworth:
I went to see Gourdy.
Maya:
"Gourdy"? What's that!?
Phoenix:
I'll... tell you later. (Why won't Edgeworth talk to us?)




Did you do it (appears after "What happened", "Gourd Lake", and presenting Attorney's Badge)







Phoenix:
Edgeworth... this is really hard for me to ask... But... you didn't do it, right? Right?
Edgeworth:
... Think what you will. I have only one request.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Edgeworth:
Stay out of this case.
Maya:
Why!? B-but Nick is trying to help you!
Edgeworth:
I know...! I know that! But I don't want your help, okay?
Maya:



Why not?
Edgeworth:
... Look, just go away, and leave me alone!
Maya:
Nick... Mr. Edgeworth did it, didn't he.
Phoenix:
Maya! Let's go investigate elsewhere.
Maya:
But, Nick...Present









Attorney's Badge







Edgeworth:
Your attorney's badge...?
Phoenix:
Edgeworth. Let me defend you.
Edgeworth:
... Hah! Hah hah! Good one, Wright. But I'm not that hard up. Not yet.
Maya:
Wh-what do you mean by that?
Edgeworth:
Me? Trust a wet-behind-the-ears lawyer with only three trials under his belt? Never!
Maya:
Wh-what!?
Edgeworth:
My case is near hopeless, Wright. Every defense attorney I've talked to has turned me down.
Phoenix:
What?
Edgeworth:
Simply put, they were afraid they'd lose. It occurred to me that it might be my fault that they lack confidence. After all, I did get every single one of their clients declared "guilty."
Phoenix:
I don't believe it!
Edgeworth:
Regardless, I don't want you involved in this. You in particular I cannot ask to do this.December 25Gourd Lake ParkEntranceMaya:
This is where it happened?Phoenix:
Yeah. Gourd Lake is in the middle of this park.Maya:
I can see some police walking around in there.Phoenix:
Questioning people, probably.Maya:
Hey! Isn't that Detective Gumshoe over there?Gumshoe:
Well, pal!? There's enough of us here! Anyone found anything?Police:
S-sorry, sir... Nothing.Gumshoe:
Idiot! The trial's tomorrow! We need clues, on the double!Police:
B-but, sir... There weren't any clues... that's why we arrested that attorney, Mr. Edgeworth! It's clear, sir. He's the one who--Gumshoe:
Shaddup! Just you try saying that again! I'll... I'll... I'll make you sorry if you do! (Changed from [I'll... er... I'll make you sorry if you do!] in the original release) So just... just, get outta my face, pal! (Changed from [I mean... just, get outta my face, pal!] in the original release)Police:
Y-yes, sir!Maya:
Detective Gumshoe's kinda scary today!Gumshoe:
Recruits... peh! ... Aah!Maya:
Eek!Gumshoe:
Hey, you're that Harry guy! Harry Butz!Phoenix:
Wright! Phoenix Wright! (Will he ever learn my name!?)Gumshoe:
And just what are you doing here, pal? Investigating!?Phoenix:
Huh? Um, well, yes. I suppose.Gumshoe:
Well, I'm here to help! Ask me anything you want! Bring it!Maya:
He seems different than usual. I wonder what's up? Umm... Mr. Edgeworth hasn't actually asked us to defend him yet...Gumshoe:
Huh!? Oh? Y-you don't say...Examine









Trees







Phoenix:
I feel winter's chill from the bare leaf trees today... *sigh* What is it about winter that turns people into poets?
Maya:
I don't know, but my toes are starting to feel numb.
Phoenix:
(Yes... my poetry has that effect on some people.)




Sign







Phoenix:
The sign says "Gourd Lake Nature Park." This place is full of families picnicking on the weekend.
Maya:
But... no waterfall.
Phoenix:
Not many picnickers come here for spiritual training, Maya.Talk









What happened







Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe? Do you know what happened here?
Gumshoe:
Huh? You don't know, pal?
Phoenix:
No...
Gumshoe:
Wow, okay, Mr. Head-in-the-fluffy-pink-clouds Lawyer.
Phoenix:
Head-in-the... huh?
Gumshoe:
Never mind, I'll tell you. It happened last night, about 15 minutes after midnight. There was a boat out on Gourd Lake. In that boat were two men. One of those men shot the other with a pistol.
Maya:
And... the shooter was Mr. Edgeworth?
Gumshoe:
A cop who arrived on the scene arrested him.
Maya:
How did they get there so fast? (Changed from [How did he get there so fast?] in the original release)
Gumshoe:
Well... There was a witness. When the report came in, we raced to the lake.
Phoenix:
A witness?




Edgeworth







Maya:
You don't think Mr. Edgeworth is a... murderer, do you!? (Changed from [You don't think Mr. Edgeworth is a... murderer!?] in the original release)
Gumshoe:
Absolutely not! It's impossible! I don't care if there's a witness either! I don't believe a lick of it!
Maya:
R-right! Who cares what the witness says!
Phoenix:
(I care!)
Maya:
... You really believe in him, don't you, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Course I do! But... the police are pretty sure he's the killer. Nobody's even really taking this investigation that seriously.
Maya:
Oh no!
Gumshoe:
After all the help Mr. Edgeworth has been to us... Hard to imagine that no one's standing up to take his side.
Maya:
Well, at least you are, Detective. At least you are.




Defense request







Maya:
Do you know who will be Mr. Edgeworth's defense attorney in tomorrow's trial?
Gumshoe:
He hasn't got one yet.
Maya:
What? The trial IS tomorrow, isn't it?
Gumshoe:
Well, I don't know the whole story... But apparently no one he's been talking to will take his case.
Maya:
W-why not?
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth won't tell me! When you guys showed up, I figured he'd asked you to defend him.
Phoenix:
U-unfortunately not...
Gumshoe:
Well, pal, then you got a job to do! Help out Mr. Edgeworth! Prove that badge you wear isn't just some fancy piece of metal! Prove it to me, pal! Show me you're an attorney!




Defense request (after presenting Attorney's Badge in Detention Center - Visitor's Room)







Maya:
I-is it true? No one will take Mr. Edgeworth's case?
Gumshoe:
Yeah... He's a bit of a celebrity. If you defended him, and lost, your reputation'd be sure to suffer. What's more... The case against him is... well, it's pretty solid.
Phoenix:
(I suppose it would be if they have a witness.)
Gumshoe:
Hey! Pal! Don't tell me your going to turn your back on him too!? Remember the Steel Samurai case? (Changed from [Remember the Steel Samurai!] in the original release) Mr. Edgeworth helped you get your client declared innocent!
Phoenix:
I... I know. I went to Edgeworth. I tried. He really doesn't want us to represent him. Especially not us, he said.
Gumshoe:
What!? W-well, that doesn't make any sense, pal! You should have heard him talking about you after that trial! (Changed from [You should have heard him talking about you after the Steel Samurai case!] in the original release) He kept saying "Wright, Wright, Wright," over and over.
Maya:
... Nick? I'm not sure that's a good sign.
Phoenix:
Neither am I...
Gumshoe:
Why wouldn't he want your help? I don't get it.




The witness (appears after "What happened")







Phoenix:
Who was this witness?
Gumshoe:
Er, sorry, pal. That's confidential. Anyway, the witness saw everything, apparently. I'm sure they'll turn up at the trial tomorrow.
Phoenix:
Was there only that one witness?
Gumshoe:
Yep. It was pretty cold out on the lake last night. And, it was Christmas Eve after all. Still, we're being thorough. You never know when you're going to turn up another witness. That's why we're here today, checking things out. So far, we're coming up empty...
Maya:
Oh! It's Christmas today! I'd forgotten. What are you getting me for Christmas, Nick?
Phoenix:
Talk to Santa.Present









Attorney's Badge







Gumshoe:
That badge! You're showing that to the wrong guy, pal! You gotta show that to someone who needs it!After clearing all Talk options:Police:
Detective Gumshoe, sir!Gumshoe:
What? Find something!?Police:
Um, no, sir. Not yet. But there was a call from the precinct. They want to hold an investigation briefing...Gumshoe:
A briefing? Right! I'm off! Oh... Sorry, pal. I guess you heard. I gotta go. Any last things you want to ask me about before I head back?The autopsy report







Maya:
Well, yes. Do you have any information on the victim...?
Gumshoe:
Sorry... They haven't worked up the autopsy report yet. I'm still waiting for it myself. Actually... Say, if you get the time, drop by the precinct! We can talk more there, pal!

"You're not coming back, Detective?"How to get in touch with you







Leads to:
"You're not coming back, Detective?"Phoenix:
You're not coming back, Detective?Gumshoe:
Erm... Probably not, pal.Phoenix:
So, what should we do if we have something to talk to you about...?Gumshoe:
Ah, right. Here, I'll show you how to get to the precinct. Come down and see me anytime.Detective Gumshoe gave you directions to the police station.Phoenix:
Oh, hey! Detective Gumshoe!Gumshoe:
W-what!?Phoenix:
Um, we'd like to take a look around in the park. Can we walk around?Gumshoe:
Yeah! No problem, pal. You got my permission.Maya:
You know, Nick. I think there's something to be said for talking to people when they're busy.Phoenix:
Yeah. They don't have time to think about not giving you information...Maya:
Right! Now, let's get investigating!December 25Police DepartmentCriminal AffairsMaya:
... Looks like Detective Gumshoe isn't here.Chief:
Something wrong, miss? Hmm? Turning yourself in? Okay, what did you do? Shoplifting? Larceny? Public indecency...?Maya:
N-no! None of those things! We're looking for Detective Gumshoe... is he around?Chief:
Gumshoe? Oh yeah. He's in a meeting right now. I don't think he'll be out any time soon.Maya:
Okay, we'll come back.Chief:
You do that. Oh, and go straight home and stay out of trouble. No more shoplifting, you got that?Maya:
... Do I look like a criminal or something?Examine









Poster







Phoenix:
A poster of a female police officer... Wait, no. That's the latest "Babes in Uniform" calendar. My bad.




Detective







Phoenix:
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
Police:
"...your mama could see you know she'd be crying'... ...a break and spit it out, you lowlife scumbag..."
Phoenix:
... He must be doing image training for interrogations.




Desk







Phoenix:
These are the detectives' desks. There are computers and files on each one. Funny, they're a lot tidier than I'd expect. I guess the detectives don't spend a lot of time at their desks.




Blue Badger







Phoenix:
Hey, is that the police department's mascot...?
Chief:
That's the "Blue Badger"! It was my idea! I made it! It's my mascot!
Phoenix:
I... see. How nice.
Chief:
I'll get him assigned mascot of the Criminal Affairs Dept. if it's the last thing I do!
Phoenix:
Um, good luck!




Chief







Phoenix:
This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen.
Chief:
Wha...!? "Gourd Lake...!" "Gourdy sighted"!!! I don't believe it!
Phoenix:
(Shouldn't you be reading something more important...?)December 25Gourd LakePublic BeachMaya:
Wowsers! This is "Gourd Lake"?Phoenix:
Yup. I'm not sure it warrants a "wowsers," though.Maya:
Hmm. Probably not. But hey, look at that snack stand!Phoenix:
"Samurai Dogs"...?Maya:
I wanna Samurai Dog! Please! I bet they're great!Phoenix:
With a name like Samurai Dog, how could they not be?Maya:
They're a little behind the times, though. The kids are all into "The Pink Princess" now. I mean, like, y'know!?Phoenix:
(Nope.)Examine









Lake







Maya:
Wow. Gourd Lake is really big.
Phoenix:
Yeah.
Maya:
Say, Nick. Why is it called "Gourd Lake"?
Phoenix:
Oh. Well, a long time ago, they used to grow gourds here.
Maya:
Whoa! No way! I was sure it was because the lake looked like a gourd when viewed from above! You know, like an hourglass shape?
Phoenix:
Well, it is shaped like a gourd, actually. But that's just a coincidence.
Maya:
Oh. Okay.




Trash can







Phoenix:
The trashcan is empty. At least the place is well maintained.




Bench







Phoenix:
A lineup of plastic benches. I guess the idea is you buy a dog and eat it here. I doubt anyone would sit here and eat on a day like this. Except maybe Maya... if she had a Samurai Dog.




Sign







Phoenix:
Huh... I almost didn't see that signpost. "Left - Boat docks" "Right - Exit"




Vendor stand







Phoenix:
A hotdog stand. It's closed... The Christmas fringe looks a little half-baked. The banner reads "Samurai Dogs"... Somebody needs to redecorate.




Popper







Maya:
Huh. Someone left some poppers here. You know, you pull the string... (Changed from [Huh. Someone left one of those poppers here. You know, you pull the string...] in the original release)
Phoenix:
...And it goes "pop." Yeah, I know the ones. You see them a lot around New Year's.
Maya:
Hey, Nick! They might be a clue! (Changed from [Hey, Nick! It might be a clue!] in the original release) Let's take them. (Changed from [Let's take it.] in the original release)
Phoenix:
C'mon, admit it. You just want to pop them, right? (Changed from [C'mon, admit it. You just want to pop it, right?] in the original release)
Maya:
Was it that obvious?
Phoenix:
(Poppers... hmm.) (Changed from [A popper... hmm.] in the original release)



Take them (Changed from [Take it] in the original release)







Phoenix:
I suppose it couldn't hurt. Huh? Where'd they go? (Changed from [Huh? Where'd it go?] in the original release)

Poppers put in pocket. (Changed from [Popper put in pocket.] in the original release)

Leave them (Changed from [Leave it] in the original release)







Phoenix:
Nah, let's leave them. (Changed from [Nah, let's leave it.] in the original release)

Anything else







Maya:
Nick! If we don't hurry Mr. Edgeworth will get the death sentence!!!
Phoenix:
Whoa! O-okay! Let's go check things out.Detention CenterPresent









Anything else







Edgeworth:
What's that? I'm not in the mood for idle banter, Wright.December 25Boat Rental ShopMaya:
Nick... what is this place?Phoenix:
A boat rental shop. Closed for Christmas it seems. I guess a murder taking place on one of the boats won't be good for business, either.Maya:
Boats... I've never ridden on a boat.Phoenix:
Really? Well, how about we go out on one when the trial is finished?Maya:
Hey, good idea! You bet!Examine









Trees







Phoenix:
There's more forest off that way. I doubt I'd find any helpful clues in there.




Shop







Phoenix:
A small boat rental shop. Doesn't look like anyone is around. They're probably closed because it's Christmas.




Boats







Phoenix:
There are some boats floating at the dock. Was one of these boats used in the murder, I wonder?
Maya:
Nick?
Phoenix:
Huh?
Maya:
I changed my mind. I don't really want to go for a boat ride.December 25Gourd Lake WoodsMaya:
I like it here, Nick. Look... someone's camping!Phoenix:
They've got guts, camping at the scene of a murder.Maya:
Hey, hey, Nick! If they were camping here last night, they might know about the murder!Phoenix:
(That's true...) Good call, Maya. Let's go talk to them.Examine









Camera







Maya:
Hey, Nick. Check out this camera!
Phoenix:
Yeah... what's with the big mic and that box on top, I wonder? It looks like some sort of automatic system for taking a photo when a noise is heard.
Maya:
Wow! Hey, let's see if it works! *cough* "Hi, I'm Nick!" ... Maybe I'm not saying it loud enough. "YO! I'M NICK!!!" ... Huh. NIIIIIIIIII......IIIIIIIIIICK!
Phoenix:
Will you stop that?
Maya:
I think it's broken, Nick.
Phoenix:
D-don't kick it! (It must not be set up to respond to voices.)




Camera (after Popper is added to the Court Record)







Leads to:
"This camera has a mic and some sort of attachment."




Trees







Phoenix:
The trees grow quite thick here. Further back, the trees fade into the shadow where the sunlight can't reach them.




Sign







Phoenix:
The sign says "No Camping." Funny place to pick to pitch your tent.
Maya:
Wait, what if the sign said "No Setting Tents on Fire"?
Phoenix:
... I don't think they have signs like that.
Maya:
Oh...




Sheet







Phoenix:
There's food and some magazines on the sheet. It takes a pretty tough skin to camp in this cold.




Campfire







Maya:
Hey, Nick!
Phoenix:
What, don't tell me you're hungry again?
Maya:
No, no. I was just wondering, why are camping pots and pans made of aluminum?
Phoenix:

It happened late in the night on Christmas Eve.

A man on a boat was shot... Did you see anything?

Phoenix:
Do you know anything about the victim yet?
Gumshoe:
No, no... Still can't I.D. him.
Maya:
Has Mr. Edgeworth said anything?
Gumshoe:
Not a word.




The meeting







Phoenix:
So, how did the meeting go?
Gumshoe:
I can't tell you, pal! You're a lawyer!
Phoenix:
T-true...
Gumshoe:
... Y'know... I don't know what to believe anymore. Sure, Mr. Edgeworth's human like you or me. Still... I get the feeling that if he'd done something wrong, he wouldn't go hiding it. That's just the kind of guy he is. Why can't anyone else see that?
Maya:
So, they think that Mr. Edgeworth did it...?
Gumshoe:
Well, the trial's starting tomorrow, as scheduled.
Maya:
I see...
Gumshoe:
...
Phoenix:
Umm... hey, in the end you did tell us about the meeting!
Gumshoe:
... Don't go telling anyone else, pal.
Phoenix:
Y-yes, sir!
Gumshoe:
And... do me a favor! Stand by Mr. Edgeworth! He needs help, and you're the ones to help him! I'm sure he's got some reason why he won't talk to us.
Maya:
Thanks, Detective Gumshoe.




Trusting Edgeworth (appears after "The meeting")







Maya:
Detective Gumshoe... How come you trust Mr. Edgeworth so much?
Gumshoe:
Well, I'd think that was obvious. We got a strong working relationship, us two. We trust each other, and that's how it works.
Maya:
A "working relationship"?
Gumshoe:
See, Mr. Edgeworth always gets his defendants declared "guilty" every time. Yeah, his methods might be a little extreme at times. But... there's a reason! He trusts our investigation, see? He trusts us to get the right man! That's why I work extra hard, pal. We've got to earn that trust he places in us.
Maya:
I see...
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth is a man you can trust... And you have my word on that!




The autopsy report (appears after "Trusting Edgeworth")

What to do







Phoenix:
Well, what should we do?
Maya:
Hmm... The police have pretty much made up their minds that Mr. Edgeworth did it. And Mr. Edgeworth won't tell us anything. I guess we could go look for clues down by the lake?
Phoenix:
Right.

"That case"...?
Grossberg:
Yes, the "DL-6 Incident."
Phoenix:
"DL-6"...? (Why does that sound so familiar?)
Grossberg:
Perhaps you remember?
Phoenix:
(I'm sure someone mentioned it during the trial for Mia's murder.)
Grossberg:
That was the incident where the police were so at a loss they used a spirit medium.
Maya:
...! Wait... you don't mean? Was that medium my mother?
Grossberg:
Yes, my dear. The spirit medium, Misty Fey, your mother, contacted the spirit of the victim. But... the case was a loss. No conviction was made.




The DL-6 Incident (appears after "Robert Hammond")







Grossberg:
The DL-6 Incident, yes... Happened 15 years ago. A very strange case, indeed.
Phoenix:
They never caught the criminal, right?
Grossberg:
Correct. Misty Fey used her powers to talk to the spirit of the late victim. Her testimony led to charges being laid against one man. But Mr. Hammond won the case and the suspect was declared innocent.
Maya:
... And the police blamed my mother, calling her a fraud. You were the one who helped her out then, right, Mr. Grossberg?
Grossberg:
Er... y-yes. Yes, quite.
Maya:
Thank you!
Grossberg:
N-no... please. D-don't mention it.
Phoenix:
... (DL-6... Never thought I'd hear that name again...)
Maya:
But wait... What does this case have anything to do with Mr. Edgeworth?
Grossberg:
It has everything to do with Mr. Edgeworth, my dear! The victim in the DL-6 Incident was none other than his father, Gregory Edgeworth!
Maya:
Wh-what!? His father!?
Grossberg:
... If you want to know more, you should ask him yourself. Show him this... I'm sure he'll talk to you.
Maya:
Wait... This is a photograph of my mother!
Misty Fey's Photo added to the Court Record.

Grossberg:
You've really grown up in the past few years, my dear! How proud Mia would be if she could see you now!
Maya:
She said she was more worried about me than anything.
Phoenix:
Aww, just go on and take the compliment, will you?




Lotta's Camera







Grossberg:
So, this camera on the lake takes a photo whenever it hears an explosion sound?
Maya:
That's what she said.
Grossberg:
And it just happened to be set up on the beach, pointing out on the lake?
Maya:
Yes... she said it was to photograph "shooting stars."
Grossberg:
Hmm. Shooting stars... explosions... what's the connection? I'd be suspicious of this witness of yours.




Autopsy Report







Grossberg:
Hmm? Strange... I feel as though I've seen this man somewhere before! ... Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Phoenix:
Did you remember!?
Grossberg:
He was a lawyer! Here, in my office! That's Hammond! Robert Hammond!
Maya:
Mr. Hammond...?
Grossberg:
And you say this is the man Miles Edgeworth shot?

Grossberg:
So this is the moment the crime took place, eh?
Phoenix:
Yes.
Grossberg:
You can't really say for sure that's Edgeworth. I'm not sure whether that's a good thing or a bad thing. Not sure at all...

Grossberg:
Misty Fey. Mother of Mia and Maya Fey. Show this photograph to Miles Edgeworth. He'll have something to say to you then.

Phoenix:
Why did you go to Gourd Lake?
Edgeworth:
I have no intention of telling you.
Phoenix:
Nor, apparently, would you tell Detective Gumshoe.
Edgeworth:

Detective Gumshoe was really worried about you!
Edgeworth:

The DL-6 Incident (appears after presenting Misty Fey's Photo)







Edgeworth:
The "DL-6 Incident"... was when my father died. Right before my eyes... He was shot and killed, and I saw it all.
Maya:
...!
Edgeworth:
My memories from that time are... foggy. I suppose it's a self-defense mechanism. In any case, a suspect was arrested... a man. It's pretty clear he was the only one who could have killed my father. The spirit medium they used to talk to my late father said the same thing. It was an attorney by the name of Robert Hammond that cleared the suspect's name.
Phoenix:
And Hammond... is the victim in the Gourd Lake murder?
Edgeworth:
Correct.
Maya:
Umm... That spirit medium... that was my mom.
Edgeworth:
What? You mean you're...? ... It's strange. I thought that terrible incident was about to end, and now... this.
Phoenix:
"About to end"?
Edgeworth:
The DL-6 Incident happened 15 years ago. 15 years ago... on December 28.
Maya:
December 28?
Edgeworth:
The statute of limitations on the case runs out in three days.
Phoenix:
What!?
Maya:
Um, Nick? What does that mean?
Phoenix:
When a case's statute of limitations runs out, legally, the case never happened.
Edgeworth:
Three days from now, DL-6 will be closed... forever.




The suspect (appears after "The DL-6 Incident")







Maya:
What happened to the suspect? The one who got off innocent?
Edgeworth:
I don't know... He disappeared from public view. Nobody knows where to. If he's still alive, he'd be about 50 years old now.
Phoenix:
(I guess I can understand why he'd go into hiding... It'd be hard to live a normal life after being a murder suspect in such a big case.)




Your father (appears after "The DL-6 Incident")







Maya:
Umm... so, was your father a lawyer?
Edgeworth:
He was... Gregory Edgeworth. He was quite famous at the time, apparently.
Maya:
So, you were sort of trying to follow in his footsteps.
Edgeworth:
... I'd rather not talk about it.Present

It's only been a matter of hours since you last visited. Yet you've made incredible progress in your investigation. I'll admit it, I'm impressed, Wright. You were always single-minded in your work, though. Once you start on something, you always see it through, don't you?
Phoenix:
About the "DL-6 Incident"...
Edgeworth:
Right... DL-6. I didn't want you to find out about it. That is why I refused your offer to defend me. I'm sorry if it sounded like I thought you weren't up to the job. I just wanted to keep you away from DL-6.
Phoenix:
So... do you still think it would have been better for me to stay away?
Edgeworth:
I don't know. But... I see no point in hiding anything from you now. Very well. Ask whatever you like, and I will answer to the best of my abilities.

Well, I guess we're done. Mr. Edgeworth doesn't seem like he's going to stand up any time soon. Let's go, Nick.Phoenix:

So... what did Ms. Hart say?
Gumshoe:
She says she saw Mr. Edgeworth fire the pistol.
Maya:
What!?
Gumshoe:
She even had a photograph to prove it.
Phoenix:
Right. I saw it too... But you really can't tell from the photo who it is shooting.
Gumshoe:
That's why she said she's going to enlarge the photo. She said "it'll drop the quality a mite, but should let us see who's who!"
Maya:
She can do that!?
Phoenix:
(Okay, so there's going to be an enlarged photograph that shows Edgeworth in the act. Great. Just great.)
Gumshoe:
In any case, she's going to be the one testifying tomorrow.
Maya:
Huh? What happened to the other witness?
Gumshoe:
Well... Apparently, there was a cancellation.
Phoenix:
(A "cancellation"...!?)




Tomorrow's trial







Gumshoe:
I'm afraid tomorrow is going to be life or death for poor Mr. Edgeworth. We got a witness who says she saw the very moment of the murder. And we got a photo taken when the shot rang out.
Phoenix:
(I'd say that sounds like a pretty unwinnable case... But wait... What did Mia used to say? If he's innocent, there's got to be something I've overlooked...)




Edgeworth







Gumshoe:
It sound like Mr. Edgeworth is going to ask the state to assign a public defender. I was just asked to file the paperwork. But you still got time, pal! Go talk to him again, for me, please!

Worried? We're fine! I've lived out here my whole life. I'm pretty used to them by now.Gumshoe:
Oh, I wasn't worried about you two. I was worried about Mr. Edgeworth!Phoenix:

Yeah, well, I'm not surprised. It was a pretty big quake. I'm going to go check on him. You two go eat and get your rest for tomorrow's trial. Later!Maya:

I wonder... He was never that scared of them when he was in school.Phoenix:

Karma...? (ellipsis and question mark highlighted in the original release)Edgeworth:
That's right, Manfred von Karma. He's the best prosecutor there is. He hasn't lost a case in his 40-year career. He is a god of prosecution, Wright! A god!Maya:
Not a single case?Edgeworth:
He'll do anything to get a guilty verdict, anything.Phoenix:
Hmm. Sounds like someone else I know, Edgeworth.Edgeworth:
Hmph. You don't understand. I mean he'll really do anything. Manfred von Karma is a man to be feared.Phoenix:
(That's quite a claim coming from someone who forges evidence...)Edgeworth:
He taught me what it really means to "prosecute."Phoenix:
Wh-what!?Edgeworth:
Just picture a prosecutor as vicious as me... multiplied by a factor of ten.Maya:
Ugh... So... so was he your teacher, then, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:
Something like that...Maya:
And now he's trying to get you found guilty!? What a creep! Oh, wait... Maybe he's planning on losing on purpose to help you out.Edgeworth:
Not a chance... He hasn't lost once in 40 years. 40 years! He's as ruthless as me, times twenty!Maya:
That's pretty ruthless...Edgeworth:
Like I said. He's a god among prosecutors.Phoenix:
(I guess that's something like Mia was to me. Speaking of Mia...) Um, Maya?Maya:
Uh huh?Phoenix:
We could really be using Mia's help right now... don't you think?Maya:
Oh...Phoenix:

I can't. Sorry. I tried, I really tried, but I couldn't reach.Phoenix:
You couldn't "reach"?Maya:

I'm really sorry. I'll try my best!Phoenix:
I hope so!Edgeworth:
What are you whispering about?Phoenix:
O-oh, it's nothing. Well, it's time. Let's head in...December 26, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Miles Edgeworth.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.Karma:
...Judge:
Err, Mr. von Karma? Is the prosecution ready?Karma:
... Fool... You seriously think that I would stand here were I not completely prepared?Judge:
R-right, my apologies!Phoenix:
(He's even got the Judge scared!)Judge:
Very well, your opening statement, please.Karma:
... Decisive evidence... A decisive witness... What else could possibly be required?Judge:
Ah... er, nothing of course. That should be fine. The prosecution may call its first witness.Maya:
What's with this guy? Is he royalty or something?Phoenix:
How am I supposed to fight against this!?Karma:
I call the detective in charge of this case, Detective Dick Gumshoe.Phoenix:
(Okay, Gumshoe's first... Let's see how this goes.)Karma:
Describe the incident. Now!Gumshoe:
Y-yessir!Phoenix:
(Detective Gumshoe looks nervous...)Gumshoe:
Er, please take a look at the map. The murder happened late Christmas Eve, around midnight. There was one boat in the very middle of the lake. There were two men on the boat. Now, there happened to be a woman camping here on the edge of the lake. At 12:10 AM, she heard two pistol shots. Then the boat started to move. It went towards the boat rental shop.Karma:
Hmm.Overhead Map added to the Court Record.Karma:
Testify to the court about your arrest. Now!Judge:
W-w-wait! Mr. von Karma...Karma:
Yes?Judge:
Actually, I'm the one that's supposed to be handling these proceedings...Karma:
Wrong. There is only one thing you need to do here. You will slam down your gavel and say the word "guilty." That is your role!Judge:
Y-yes, of course. You're quite right.Phoenix:
(No, he's not!!!)Witness Testimony-- The Arrest of Edgeworth --Gumshoe:
A man called into the station around 30 minutes after midnight.
We headed to the scene of the crime as fast as we could.
That's where we found Mr. Edgeworth.
Now, I didn't suspect him of anything at all.
But... the next morning, a body was found in the lake.
So we had to arrest Mr. Edgeworth.Judge:

You received a call from a "man"?
Gumshoe:
Er... yup.
Phoenix:
But you said there was a woman camping there? She was the one who heard the two gunshots, right?
Karma:

Karma:
That woman and the "man" who called in the report are two different people, obviously!
Phoenix:
Different people?
Karma:
There were two witnesses!
Phoenix:
(Urk!)
Karma:
Their testimonies were quite similar however. Today I've summoned the woman who was camping.

We headed to the scene of the crime as fast as we could.Press







Phoenix:

How long was it between receiving the report and your arrival at the lake?
Gumshoe:
Er, well... I'd say it was about three minutes.

That's pretty fast!

Our motto for the month is "get there quick."

Karma:
Detective! You will refrain from casually revealing department secrets!

You should know! We have a deep, trusting relationship with the prosecutors.

Karma:
Continue! Now!Gumshoe:
But... the next morning, a body was found in the lake.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Did you find any clues on the body?
Gumshoe:
A single bullet was recovered from the body. He was shot through the heart... fatally.

Was the bullet found in the body fired from this pistol?Gumshoe:
Yes. The ballistic markings on the bullet match the pistol.Judge:
Hmm...Maya:
Hey, Nick! What does he mean, "ballistic markings"?Karma:
Shocking! To imagine someone here does not know something as basic as ballistic markings!Maya:
N-Nick! He's glaring at me!Karma:
Tsk... very well, I'll explain. Actually, Judge! You do it.Judge:
Eh? M-me? ... Erm, ahem. Ballistic markings are like the "fingerprints" of a gun. The barrel leaves distinctive marks on each bullet it fires. You can examine these "ballistic fingerprints" to see which gun fired the shot. It's quite accurate.Karma:
Indeed. This leads to one, inevitable conclusion: the bullet found in the victim's heart... was, without a doubt, fired from this pistol. This pistol which, as you may recall, was covered with the defendant's own fingerprints!Judge:
O-order! Order!Phoenix:
(This is bad... This makes it look like Edgeworth did it!)Karma:
Well, Judge?Judge:
I'd say it's almost decisive, yes. Honestly, I could declare a verdict at this point. However...Karma:
You wish to hear the witness speak, no doubt. Very well. I am somewhat fatigued, and so I will take a brief break. I will call my witness after the recess. Which will last ten minutes. Judge!Judge:
Y-yes?Karma:
What are you doing? A ten minute recess! Now!Judge:

Y-you mean it was a suicide!?Edgeworth:

Y-yeah, I understand, I understand!Judge:
Er... very well. Your testimony, please.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Lotta:
It was Christmas Eve, just after midnight, I reckon.
I was in my car.
I heard this "bang" come up from the lake.
When I looked out the window, I saw two gents in a boat.
Then there was another "bang"...
There wasn't nary a thing on the lake but that boat.Karma:
Enough.Lotta:
Huh?Karma:
Judge! She happened to take a photo of the incident! This is that photo. Accept it as evidence.Judge:
W-well! This is a surprise! This looks like... the very moment of the murder! O-Order! I will remove you from the court if I do not have order immediately!Karma:
As the witness testified, she looked at the lake when she heard the shot. There were no other boats on that lake! So, the man in the boat with the victim must have been the one who shot him... Yes. It was the defendant, Miles Edgeworth!!!Judge:
Order! Order! Order...! I will have order!Karma:
... Well, Judge?Judge:
The evidence is... decisive. I have very little doubt about this case. Very well, this court finds the defendant...Phoenix:Phoenix:
W-wait! Your Honor! I haven't cross-examined the witness yet!Karma:
A cross-examination? We have photographic proof! What question can there possibly be!? This photo is worth a thousand words... and they all read "guilty"! You lose. Or... Do you claim to have found a contradiction in her testimony!?Phoenix:
...!Karma:
Very well. If you have to, you may cross-examine the witness. You will only flounder and ask meaningless questions! You will fail to find anything! And then, I will have you held in contempt of court!Maya:
Uh, Nick... contempt...?Phoenix:

Phoenix:
He'll bang down that "flimsy gavel" of his and declare Edgeworth guilty.

You were camping at the lake to take a picture of Gourdy! Think about it-- What would you do if you heard a loud noise? You'd be scanning the lake for any sign of Gourdy, that's what! You wouldn't give the boat a second thought!Lotta:
Aah!Judge:
Order! Continue, Mr. Wright!Phoenix:
You testified that you were watching the boat through binoculars! However, you wouldn't need binoculars to watch that boat! You needed them to search for Gourdy... and that's what you were doing!Lotta:
...! ... ...Phoenix:
Well!?Lotta:
Hmph... Well, now that y'all mention it... I did sort of take my binoculars and kind of scan the lake a bit... I mean, Gourdy might be out there, n' all...Judge:
M-Ms. Hart! A-are you saying that you were NOT watching the boat, then?Lotta:
... S-sorry, y'all. I wasn't fibbing, really. I was, just... I thought y'know, I could be witness to a murder n' all! I kinda got excited. I was sure I was watching that boat... till now.Judge:
... This... this is totally uncalled for--Lotta:
B-but hey! You got the photograph! You got proof!Judge:
Hmm... Still, we can't see who is shooting who in this.Lotta:
Right! Right! That's why I took this photo n'...Karma:Karma:
Witness... That's enough. You've had a long day. Shut your pie-hole.Lotta:
Sh-shut my what!?Phoenix:
(What was she going to say? She took the photo... and what? Wait a second...)Gumshoe:
She even had a photograph to prove it.Phoenix:
But you really can't tell from the photo who is shooting.Gumshoe:
That's why she said she's going to enlarge the photo. She said "it'll drop the quality a mite, but should let us see who's who!"Phoenix:
(She enlarged that photo! Why won't von Karma let her show it? I've got a hunch! I bet that enlarged photo shows something bad for von Karma! This is my chance! If I'm wrong, though, it'll mean prison for Edgeworth... or worse. What should I do!?)Make her show the enlargement







Leads to:
"Ms. Hart! Look at this photograph."Wait and see what happens







Phoenix:
(If this is a trap... I'd better hold back and see how things go. But... if I wait now, the cross-examination will be over! Can I really risk that!?)



Do nothing







Judge:
This hereby ends the cross-examination of Ms. Lotta Hart.
Karma:
And none too soon. That was a flagrant waste of my time.
Judge:
Mr. von Karma, do you have anything to add?
Karma:
I stated everything I needed to when this trial began. Decisive evidence. A decisive witness. What else could possibly be required?
Judge:
Nothing, of course.
Phoenix:
(Oh no! I should have pressed further!)
Judge:
This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court find the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth...

Guilty

Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!
Game over




Rethink position







Phoenix:
(I have to fight now or I could lose everything!)
Leads to:
"Ms. Hart! Look at this photograph."Phoenix:
Ms. Hart! Look at this photograph. You enlarged this photograph, did you not?Lotta:
Y-yeah! I did!Phoenix:
Why has that enlargement not been presented to the court!?Karma:Karma:
B-because it does not exist!Lotta:
What're y'all talking about!? You were the one who told me not to show it in court in the first place! You old fool!Judge:
What's the meaning of this, Mr. von Karma!Karma:
Er... erm...Phoenix:
Ms. Hart! Show the photo to the court! Show us the enlargement!Karma:Karma:
The prosecution objects to the submission of this evidence!Judge:
Objection... denied. The witness will show the enlargement to the court.Lotta:
Here it is.Judge:
Hmm. We still cannot see who is firing in this. It could be the defendant... or maybe it's not. Regardless, I'll accept this as evidence.Lake Photo added to the Court Record.Karma:
Happy now, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:
Hmm... (There has to be something!)Karma:
You asked for the enlargement, you got the enlargement. And little good it has done any of us! That's why I requested she not show it!Judge:
Hmm... I suppose this means that the cross-examination...Karma:
Is over! Obviously!Judge:
Then, I would like to close the cross-examination of Ms. Lotta Hart.Karma:
And none too soon. That was a flagrant waste of my time.Judge:
Mr. von Karma, do you have anything to add?Karma:
I stated everything I needed to when this trial began. Decisive evidence. A decisive witness. What else could possibly be required?Judge:
Nothing, of course. Then, I believe it is time for me to declare my verdict.Phoenix:
(Wait... it's not supposed to go like this! There has to be a clue in this photo... somewhere! This is bad! Real bad! What should I do!?)Object to the enlargement







Leads to:
"Your Honor!"Show other evidence







Phoenix:
W-wait! Your Honor, This evidence...
Karma:

Karma:
I believe we have spent enough time talking about evidence!
Judge:
Hmm... indeed. We've heard opinions on every piece of evidence but this enlargement. I see no point in retracing our steps.
Leads back to:
"This is bad! Real bad! What should I do!?"Wait and see







Phoenix:
(Uh oh... think of something! No good... I guess I'll just sit back and see how this turns out.)
Judge:
Very well! Allow me to state my verdict.
Phoenix:
(Oh no! I should have pressed further!)
Judge:
This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court find the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth...

Guilty

Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!
Game overPhoenix:
Your Honor! There is something decidedly strange with this enlargement!Judge:
W-what might that be? Mr. Wright... You will show the court what you mean! What about this photo is "strange"?Phoenix:
(Okay... here goes nothing! I'll show the judge what's strange about this photo.)Present shooter's hand or pistol







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Here, Your Honor!"Present shooter







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Here, your honor!
Judge:
The shooter...? I'm not sure I understand. What about the shooter is strange? Can you be more specific?
Phoenix:
(Specific, right...)
Leads back to:
"I'll show the judge what's strange about this photo."Present anywhere else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Here, Your Honor!
Judge:
Where...? Mr. Wright, I understand you're in a tight spot. However! You have nothing to gain by making baseless claims of faulty evidence!
Phoenix:
Y-Your Honor! Never mind that... my, my finger slipped! Please let me show you again!
Judge:
Hmm...
Leads back to:
"I'll show the judge what's strange about this photo."Phoenix:
Here, Your Honor!Judge:
The shooter...? I'm not sure I understand. What about the shooter is strange?Phoenix:
Look at the hand holding the pistol, Your Honor!Judge:
The hand...?Phoenix:
That hand directly contradicts another piece of evidence!Judge:
This man's left hand does what...!?Phoenix:
Let me show you. I'll show you the evidence that left hand contradicts!Present Pistol







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"The evidence is clear."Present anything else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
(Hmm... I'm not sure this warrants a "take that!" I'd better think this one through!)
Judge:
Mr. Wright, please hurry up. We haven't got all day.
Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor! Right away!
Leads back to:
"I'll show you the evidence that left hand contradicts!"Phoenix:
The evidence is clear. The man in this photograph is holding that pistol in his left hand. However! The prints on the murder weapon were from Edgeworth's "right hand"! Ergo! The man shooting the pistol in this photograph... Is not Mr. Edgeworth!!!Judge:
Now that everyone in the courtroom has quieted down... I would like to reconvene this court of law! Mr. Wright.Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.Judge:
You have given us definitive proof today. We now know that it was not Mr. Edgeworth who fired the pistol that night. However... This leaves us with a rather large problem. If Mr. Edgeworth didn't do it, then who shot our victim?Karma:
Precisely! As we have seen, there were no other people on the lake that night! Who but the defendant could have shot the victim!?Ms. Hart







Phoenix:
Who else but the witness, Ms. Lotta Hart!
Judge:
Wh-what!? Do you have proof of this!?
Phoenix:
(Proof-shmoof! Always with the proof! Oh... wait, I do need proof, don't I.)
Judge:
Mr. Wright! I'll have you remember this is a court of law!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh. The Judge is mad.)
Karma:
Let me ask again!
Leads back to:
"Who but the defendant could have shot the victim!?"The victim himself







Leads to:
"There is only one explanation remaining!"Larry







Phoenix:
(Wait, wait--I can't do that. Sacrifice one friend to save another? What's the point!?)
Karma:
Well, Wright! Your answer!
Leads back to:
"Who but the defendant could have shot the victim!?"Phoenix:
There is only one explanation remaining! The man who shot the victim was none other than... the victim himself!!!Judge:
Order! Order! So... you are saying that the victim committed suicide?Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. I can think of no other explanation.Judge:
Hmm... Indeed, that does seem to be the only remaining option.Karma:Karma:
I'm so very, very sorry, Mr. Wright. But suicide is out of the question.Phoenix:
Wh-what!?Karma:
An examination of the victim's wound reveals the distance at which he was shot.Phoenix:
The... distance?Karma:
The victim was clearly shot from further than a meter away!Phoenix:
A meter! Th-that's three feet!Karma:
There is no way it could have been suicide!Judge:
Order! Order! Mr. von Karma! Are you sure of the accuracy of your data!?Karma:
Of course! I had already considered the possibility of suicide, you see.Autopsy Report updated in the Court Record.Judge:
Hmm... I see. Very well, allow me to state my opinion. Considering the situation, the shooter had to be the defendant, Mr. Edgeworth. However! The prints on the gun reveal that the shooter was not Mr. Edgeworth. This is a conundrum. Therefore, I would like to suspend proceedings for this trial for the day. The court orders the defense and the prosecution to further investigate this matter. Understood?Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.Karma:
...Judge:
That is all. The court is adjourned.December 26, 1:15 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2Phoenix:
Whew, that was a close one.Edgeworth:
...Phoenix:
Hey! Don't you have anything to say!?Edgeworth:
No. I have yet to be declared innocent, Wright.Phoenix:
Well, yeah, but... What happened out there on that lake, anyway!? If he didn't commit suicide, then who...? The shooter was about a meter away, too!Edgeworth:
... W-what? Don't give me that look! I did not kill him!Phoenix:
I was just kidding around.Edgeworth:
Hmph.Phoenix:
Look... I'm going to go check on Maya.Edgeworth:
Oh... Wright.Phoenix:
What?Edgeworth:
Tell her something for me.Phoenix:
What?Edgeworth:
... ... ... Tell... Tell her to watch what she says in court. That's all.Phoenix:
(Would it kill you to just state how you really feel with a "thanks", Edgeworth?) (Changed from [Yeah, I'm sure she'll be happy to hear you say that, Edgeworth. Jerk!] in the original release)Phoenix:
I requisitioned a transcript of Lotta's entire testimony. I thought it might give me some ammunition for the trial tomorrow. Of course she didn't see the shooter... So the only part of her testimony that stood was the "bang" she heard.Lotta's Deposition added to the Court Record.To be continued.Presenting wrong evidence during testimony







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Judge:
...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...
Phoenix:
Huh? Really?
Judge:
Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)Presenting wrong evidence during testimony







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
Judge:
Uh... I'm not sure I follow?
Phoenix:
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
Judge:
You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)Presenting wrong evidence during testimony







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
How exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...?
Phoenix:
They aren't, are they...
Judge:
Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)Presenting wrong evidence during testimony







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
Judge:
... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Ugh. I must be on the wrong track?)Too many penalties







Judge:
This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. This court find the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth...

Maya!Maya:
Hey! Nick, it's you! I'm glad Mr. Edgeworth made it through the day okay. It's a relief...Phoenix:
Hey. Why'd you do that, anyway?Maya:
... I don't know. I... just knew I had to do something. I know I'm not the lawyer my sister was... ... I'm sorry.Phoenix:
Well, you did save the trial... Just, behave from now on, okay?Maya:
O... Okay.Talk









Questioning







Phoenix:
Have you been questioned yet?
Maya:
No... not yet. Detective Gumshoe was here just now. He said "seeing as this is your first offense, we'll let you go after questioning."
Phoenix:
Whew...
Maya:
Oh, and he wanted me to get bail money ready. You can pay for me, okay?
Phoenix:
Huh? How much?
Maya:
I don't know. I guess they'll send you a bill or something.
Phoenix:
(Why do I picture giant bales of money every time I hear the word "bail"?)




Mia







Phoenix:
Any luck with Mia...?
Maya:
None... I can't get through to her at all. I tried... I really did! I don't know what to do... ... I think I probably shouldn't have stopped my training.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... she sounds like she really did do her best. I should check and see if there are any waterfalls in the local area...)
Maya:
I wonder if I'll ever see my sister again...Present









Attorney's Badge







Maya:
It must be nice, Nick. You can just show that to anyone and say "I'm a lawyer!" But, spirit mediums, well...
Phoenix:
I dunno, with your clothes, I bet at least some people would recognize you...
Maya:
But these are medium-in-training clothes... I wonder if I'll ever be a proper medium...




Lake Photo







Maya:
Isn't that the enlarged photo Lotta was talking about?
Phoenix:
Uh huh.
Maya:
Huh... It's nice and big... but you can't really see the faces any clearer, can you?




Misty Fey's Photo







Maya:
My... mother. ...
Phoenix:
(Now that I've shown her the picture, I'm not so sure it was the right thing to do. No... I'm pretty sure it was the wrong thing to do.)




Gourdy Article







Maya:
I want to see Gourdy, too!
Phoenix:
If he really exists.
Maya:
Well, I'd say a photograph is pretty good proof! Once this trial is over, let's get some fishing poles and go down to the lake!
Phoenix:
(Even if there is a monster in that lake, fishing poles sound like a BAD idea...)




Pistol Bullet







Maya:
So the markings on this bullet and the barrel of the pistol matched?
Phoenix:
Hey, I'm surprised you remembered that!
Maya:
How could I forget after von Karma rubbed it in so much? So, which one of these are the ballistic markings?
Phoenix:
I'm... not really sure.




Pistol







Maya:
Mr. Edgeworth's prints are on this pistol, aren't they?
Phoenix:
Yes... the prints from his right hand. But they must have gotten on there at some other time other than the shooting.
Maya:
What? Really!?
Phoenix:
(The shooter used his left hand, after all...)




Anything else







Maya:
Sorry... I'm fresh out of ideas.December 26Wright & Co. Law OfficesPhoenix:
... Sure is quiet here with nobody around. Right... I have to get Maya out of that detention cell soon!December 26Police DepartmentCriminal AffairsPhoenix:
(Detective Gumshoe's not here...)Police:
Gumshoe's at the scene again today.Phoenix:
Huh? Oh, really?Police:
He's a live wire that one. Got into a fight with the chief for not following protocol...Phoenix:
(Not following protocol...? I bet he wouldn't help them build the case against Edgeworth...)Examine









Detective







Phoenix:
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
Police:
"Don't do anything rash! Why jump...? ...You have every reason to live!"
Phoenix:
... He must be doing image training for talking down a potential suicide.




Chief







Phoenix:
This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen.
Chief:
Wha...!? Rook to Bishop 7... Checkmate!? I don't believe it!
Phoenix:
(He must be playing chess on the computer...)December 26Grossberg Law OfficesPhoenix:
Apparently, Mr. Grossberg is on vacation today. Well, I guess I can come back tomorrow if I need anything.Examine









Bookshelf







Phoenix:
Expensive-looking mahogany bookshelves, filled with expensive-looking books. Hmm... funny... they don't look like they've ever been read.




Desk







Phoenix:
A solid mahogany desk. The wood's been polished to a deep luster.




Vacant wall







Phoenix:
I guess Mr. Grossberg isn't getting that painting back. I feel kind of bad for him...




Potted plant







Phoenix:
An expensive potted plant. No idea what kind of plant it is, but it's probably the most expensive one available.




Table







Phoenix:
A table for clients. Hmm... an elegant ebony case, and if I'm not mistaken, that lighter's made of solid gold. Even I can tell someone here's got money to burn.December 26Gourd Lake ParkEntrancePhoenix:
There are fewer than there were yesterday, but the cops are still around in the park. I wonder if Detective Gumshoe is here today?Examine









Trees







Phoenix:
I feel winter's chill from the bare leaf trees today... There's a lot of trees here. I guess that's why they call it a "nature park." It's quite pretty when the cherry trees along the lakeside blossom in spring. Today... it's just cold.




Sign







Phoenix:
The sign says "Gourd Lake Nature Park." This place is full of families picnicking on the weekend. It's a little cold for picnicking these days, though.December 26Gourd LakePublic BeachPhoenix:
Haven't seen Larry around at all. Probably off paying through the nose on a date with the lovely Kiyance...Examine









Lake







Phoenix:
The famous Gourd Lake... Its green waters stretch out on both sides... It's a pretty big lake, really.December 26Boat Rental ShopPhoenix:
(Looks like the boat rental shop is closed today, too.)Examine









Shop







Phoenix:
A small boat rental shop. Doesn't look like anyone is around. They're probably closed because of the murder.




Boats







Phoenix:
There are some boats floating at the dock. The murder took place in a boat from this dock... Apparently, the police took away the actual boat that was used that night. Indeed, there's space for one more boat at the dock.December 26Gourd Lake WoodsPhoenix:
Hey, Detective Gumshoe!Gumshoe:
Hey, pal! The trial today, it, er... ...Phoenix:
Yes? What about the trial?Gumshoe:
Well, I was going to say "good show," but it wasn't really all that... Though you did save Mr. Edgeworth, I guess... (Changed from [Though you did save Edgeworth, I guess...] in the original release) I just wasn't sure how to thank you... you know?Phoenix:
Er... thanks.Examine









Camera







Phoenix:
Lotta's camera is staring out at the lake, as usual. Even a novice like me can tell that camera must cost a pretty penny. I hope she doesn't leave it out here to get stolen.




Sign







Phoenix:
The sign says "No Camping." Funny place to pick to pitch your tent.




Campfire







Phoenix:
I wonder why she brought a camping cooker with her? There's a convenience store right up the street... I guess she wanted to get into the outdoor spirit.




SUV







Phoenix:
I don't think Lotta takes very good care of her SUV. It's covered with dents. I can't believe anyone would drive their car down here.Talk









Tomorrow's trial







Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe? Any idea what strategy von Karma is planning for tomorrow?
Gumshoe:
It sounds like he's bringing in another witness!
Phoenix:
Another witness!? Oh, right, he said something about that in the trial today...


Karma:
There were two witnesses!


Phoenix:
I was wondering who that other witness was! Er... who was it?
Gumshoe:
S... sorry, pal. As much as I'd like to, I'm not at liberty to divulge that information.
Phoenix:
(Right...)




Prosecutor Edgeworth







Phoenix:
Oh, right... I wanted to ask you something about Edgeworth.
Gumshoe:
What's up?
Phoenix:
Is he afraid of earthquakes? I never heard anything about that before.
Gumshoe:
... Mr. Edgeworth doesn't talk about himself too much, see. But there's one thing that's clear as day... Him hating crime the way he does... And him becoming a lawyer... And him being scared of earthquakes... It all started with that incident.
Phoenix:
The DL-6 Incident?
Gumshoe:
Yep, that's the one. Fifteen years ago... when he saw his father shot before his very eyes! He still feels the pain now, you can see it in his eyes.




Maya Fey







Phoenix:
I wanted to talk to you about Maya Fey...
Gumshoe:
Huh? She's not out on bail yet? That's strange. I told 'em to let her go as soon as they had their report written up. Man... I don't know what would have happened in that courtroom today if it weren't for her. Seeing her getting dragged out by the bailiff... I'll be honest with you, pal. I shed a tear or two. Mr. Edgeworth, he was so moved I saw his lip trembling. (Changed from [Edgeworth, he was so moved I saw his lip trembling.] in the original release)
Phoenix:
Really!? (Cold-as-ice Edgeworth!?)
Gumshoe:
He was really grateful for what she did, you know.Present









Attorney's Badge







Gumshoe:
I think it's a little early for you to be proudly waving that thing around. You can be proud of yourself when you get Mr. Edgeworth declared innocent, pal!




Lotta's Camera







Gumshoe:
That woman really took us for a ride, didn't she? Claiming she was a witness to a murder and all...
Phoenix:
Still, if it weren't for her photograph, Mr. Edgeworth wouldn't have made it today.
Gumshoe:
Oh, huh, really?
Phoenix:
(Umm... you were at the trial, weren't you, Detective?)




Robert's Autopsy Report







Gumshoe:
Robert Hammond... He was the defense attorney in the DL-6 Incident trial. He's the one who got the sole suspect off the hook. I wonder what Mr. Edgeworth thinks of him. Not much, I'd wager.




Lake Photo







Gumshoe:
I don't care who you are, no one can tell me that that's Mr. Edgeworth! I mean, come on, it doesn't look like him at all!
Phoenix:
But Edgeworth has admitted he was on the boat.
Gumshoe:
Then he's the one being shot, then!
Phoenix:
He seemed fine in court today...
Gumshoe:
... Details, pal, details! Whose side are you on, anyway?
Phoenix:
(All I'm saying is we have to respect the evidence...)




Pistol Bullet







Gumshoe:
Yep, it was fired from the murder weapon, without a doubt.
Phoenix:
From a meter away... so it would have to have been from someone else on the boat.
Gumshoe:
Hmm...
Phoenix:
What do you make of this, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
Hey, making something of things is your job!
Phoenix:
Er... right. (Since when do lawyers have to do detectives' work for them!?)




Pistol







Gumshoe:
Maybe you should tell me why Mr. Edgeworth's prints were on the weapon, pal.
Phoenix:
Huh? How should I know!?




Lotta's Deposition







Gumshoe:
Now, she heard two gunshots, right?
Phoenix:
But wait... Look at the Court Record! According to this, the murder weapon was fired three times!
Gumshoe:
What!? How's that possible!?
Phoenix:
Where was the third shot fired?
Gumshoe:
I wonder... Maybe it was a practice shot or something?




Anything else







Gumshoe:
Sorry to disappoint you, pal. I'm drawing a blank.After clearing all Talk options:Gumshoe:
I'm going to head back to the station. I'll get the report on Maya and get her out of there as soon as I can.Phoenix:
Thank you. Oh, wait! Umm... I was wondering, how much is bail going to be?Gumshoe:
Don't worry about that. Mr. Edgeworth is posting the whole amount.Phoenix:
What? Edgeworth...?Gumshoe:
Didn't I tell you? He's grateful to her for what she did. Alright, pal. Well don't forget to go pick her up, okay?Phoenix:
(Hmm... Maybe I can get Edgeworth to pay this month's rent, too...)After clearing all Talk options in Gourd Lake Woods:December 26Detention CenterVisitor's RoomMaya:
Hey, Nick! You finally came! They just finished the paperwork, I'm free to go.Phoenix:
Free at last, eh?Maya:
Those interrogators were really mean! They were like "okay, what did you do THIS time?" Like I was some kind of criminal! Can you believe it?Phoenix:
Well, they let you out in the end, didn't they?Maya:
Mmm... Oh, that reminds me... Thanks for bail.Phoenix:
Thank Edgeworth.Maya:
Huh?Phoenix:
He posted bail for you. Said he was grateful for what you did.Maya:
Mr. Edgeworth did that...? ... I have to make it up to him! We've got to win this case, Nick!Talk









What to do







Phoenix:
What do you think we should do next?
Maya:
We're kind of lacking in the clues department. We could go to the park and look for Gourdy.
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
I-I was kidding!
Phoenix:
Still, if there are any clues out there, the park's as good a bet as any. What do you say? Shall we head down there?
Maya:
Sure!




Any ideas







Phoenix:
Have you noticed anything lately?
Maya:
Hmm... You know, I did notice one thing while I was here in detention. It's really pretty comfortable here. It's warm, and they keep it very clean.
Phoenix:
I meant have you noticed anything about the case...?
Maya:
Well... Not much more than that, no.
Phoenix:
(She's probably still upset about Mia. I should leave her alone.)Wright & Co. Law OfficesMaya:
Ahh! Fresh air! I gotta say, freedom feels great.Phoenix:
Behave yourself in the courtroom tomorrow, okay?Maya:
Heh heh heh. Misbehaving's much more fun.Phoenix:
It's not going to be so much fun when Edgeworth refuses to pay your bail again.Maya:
... Right. I'll behave.Phoenix:
(Oh dear...)Talk









What to do







Phoenix:
Well, what should we do?
Maya:
I don't know! I've been in detention this whole time. I think I'll let you decide what we should do. Deal?




Any ideas







Phoenix:
Well? Any thoughts you want to share?
Maya:
Well, I was detention all day. I think I'd like more time to think.
Phoenix:

Y'all really did it today...Phoenix:
Wh-what did we do now?Lotta:
Naw, I'm not complaining! See, I did a little thinking. A little... self-reflection, you might say. I realized that bein' a witness is a mighty big responsibility. But I just went up there and started blabbing any old thing that came to mind.Phoenix:

What did you think of the trial?
Lotta:
To be honest, I was doin' it half just to say I'd been a witness... Even though I didn't really see anything. I kinda convinced myself I had though... I'm sorry, I know I caused y'all a lot of trouble.
Maya:
Well, memory is a tricky, vague little thing.
Lotta:
Yeah, I sure know that now. I'll be fine the next time I witness a murder!
Maya:
Right!
Phoenix:
(You mean the FIRST time you witness a murder...)




Gourdy







Phoenix:
What about Gourdy?
Lotta:
Right! Well, the way I figure, the trial's only stoking the flames of Gourdy fever! I'll get my exclusive photos and rocket to stardom!
Maya:
All right, Lotta! You go, girl! I wish I could be an investigative photographer too!
Phoenix:
(Finish your spirit medium training first!)




Making it up







Phoenix:
Lotta, what do you mean by "making it up to us"?
Lotta:
Well, ya see... Actually, I got a bit of information for you.
Maya:
What!?
Lotta:
That von Karma didn't want me to say nothin' about it.
Maya:
Wh-what information!?
Lotta:
Now we're getting to the heart of it! See, I reckoned we might be able to do ourselves a little "exchange."
Phoenix:
E-"exchange"? Umm... I thought this was to "make it up to us"...?
Lotta:
Right! I propose a little exchange, to make it up to you!
Phoenix:
...
Lotta:
What!? Information don't come cheap, my friend!
Maya:
Uh...
Lotta:
Hey! I see you thinking "my, how unsophisticated these southern folks are"!!! It's written all over yer face! Let me tell you, most southerners are WAY more sophisticated than you... I'm just the exception, okay? Well, what'll it be? We gonna deal, or not!?
Maya:
Wh-what should we do, Nick?



Deal







Phoenix:
(We don't have any other leads so I don't think we have a choice here...) Okay. How much?
Lotta:
Huh? You completely off your rocker? I may not be sophisticated, but I'm not trying to rob the poor!
Leads to:
"Huh?"




No deal







Phoenix:
I'm sorry... But I've no intention of dealing with you!
Maya:
Nor do we have any money, anyway!
Lotta:
You guys make a fine team, you know that? And I can tell you don't have any money, just look at those clothes!

Lotta:
I'm glad I did that enlargement.
Phoenix:
No kidding. If we didn't have that, Edgeworth would be in prison now, or worse!
Maya:
There's never a lack of drama when you're on a case, is there, Nick?
Lotta:
What, are you always on the verge of horrible failure like this!?
Phoenix:
Umm...
Lotta:
Careful or the stress'll send you to an early grave.
Phoenix:

Gourdy Article







Maya:
Umm... uh... You know, I was wondering...
Lotta:
Yeah?
Maya:
What if you get a picture of Gourdy... and it turns out like this enlargement did?
Lotta:
Y'all crazy!? A blurry picture like this doesn't make a hit story! I need a picture that screams "I am Gourdy! Hear me roar!" I can't turn something like this into the paper! What kind of fool do y'all think I am?
Phoenix:
(The kind of fool that would turn a blurry picture in as evidence in a murder trial? Not to mention claiming she saw something she didn't see!)

Flags







Phoenix:
Those flags look sadly out of place here. Flapping listlessly back and forth in a cold wind under a cold sky...
Maya:
I dunno, I think it kind of gives the place a festival atmosphere. It reminds me of the "War of the Eyeglasses"!
Phoenix:

Well, we made it through the first day in court all right... I don't know how good our prospects are from here on, though.
Butz:
Huh.
Maya:
Hey, Larry, did you know Edgeworth's secret weakness? He's terrified of earthquakes! He acts like a little boy!
Butz:
Huh? That's weird. I don't think he was ever like that in school.
Maya:
No? Really?
Butz:
Well, we were only in the same class for a year. He transferred schools pretty quickly...

Transferred?

It's not, really. We have another meeting coming up... We're supposed to talk about Mr. Edgeworth's motive...

His motive?
Gumshoe:
See, Mr. Edgeworth's father died in the DL-6 Incident... And the guy who got the lone suspect declared innocent was the victim in this case... Robert Hammond. They're saying that's why Mr. Edgeworth shot him.

Maya:
What!? I haven't seen any monsters yet!
Lotta:
Y-y'all for real!? Gourdy really exists!? Wait! I need proof! You get a photo!?



I have proof







Phoenix:
Of course I have proof.
Maya:
No fair, Nick! It was when I went to the bathroom, wasn't it!? That's when you made contact with Gourdy!
Lotta:
Enough jabbering already, let's see your proof!



Present Air Tank (after clearing "The flying air tank" Talk option in Gourd Lake - Public Beach)







Phoenix:

Maya:
Larry's air tank...?
Lotta:
What're y'all doing with an air tank?
Phoenix:
This... is Gourdy.
Lotta:
Umm... scuze me?
Maya:
Wh-what exactly are you saying, Nick?
Phoenix:
There's a stand near here... a hotdog stand. There's a giant inflatable samurai doll there. About a week ago, an idiot, who happens to be a friend of mine, tried to fill it. He used this air tank, and when the valve blew, the tank flew into the lake. Apparently, it made a pretty loud "bang" when it flew...
Lotta:
A "bang"...?
Phoenix:
The tank, along with the still deflated Samurai fell into the lake. At the same time... A couple was taking a photograph of the lake. This photo!
Maya:
Wait... So... you're saying that Gourdy... Is really the Steel Samurai!?
Lotta:
... ... Well, that's a fine way to ruin a gal's dreams.
Phoenix:
I'm sorry, Lotta.
Lotta:
Nah, it's okay, you win. I'll give you your info, like I promised.
Maya:
Poor Lotta...

Phoenix:

Lotta:
... Y'all trying to make a fool out of me? That don't prove diddly-squat!
Maya:
Hmph. We almost had her duped, too.
Phoenix:
(We need to do something soon or I won't get that information off of her!)

I have no proof







Phoenix:
I don't have it yet, but my lawyer instincts tell me the proof is out there.
Lotta:
Hah! Nice try, but y'all can't pull the wool over these eyes that easy!

That won't work in court either, Nick...

Gourdy doesn't exist







Phoenix:
Lotta... There is no such thing as Gourdy.
Lotta:
Wh-what!? How can y'all be so sure!
Maya:
R-really, Nick!?
Lotta:
Y'all got some proof Gourdy don't exist!?
Phoenix:
The proof that Gourdy doesn't exist...



Is here







Phoenix:
Of course I have proof. No lawyer worth his badge would make a claim without proof to back it up. Here's the proof that Gourdy doesn't exist...

Boat rental...? There's someone there? I mean, it looks so deserted.Lotta:
Just an old guy, living all by himself. Y'all should go check it out.Maya:
Thanks, Lotta! We will! Let's get cracking, Nick!Lotta:
Hold on.Phoenix:
Something else?Lotta:
Yeah... the night of the murder. My camera clicked twice, you know.Maya:
...! Wait... so you have another photo?Lotta:
Well... Yeah, but there's nothing in it at all. Just the lake. I figured it wouldn't be much use as evidence, so I kept it to myself. Well, it might not be helpful at all, but... Here, take it.Second Lake Photo added to the Court Record.Lotta:
Bye now. Y'all take care. Time for me to pack up and leave.Maya:

It's all Larry's fault. The legend still lives on, I guess.Maya:

Yeah, the legend of Larry, familiar to all who know him for any length of time... "When something smells, it's usually the Butz."Maya:
Hmm. Someone should whip that Butz into shape.December 26Boat Rental ShopMaya:

Stove







Phoenix:
Looks like a kitchen unit. It's pretty clean. Funny, he doesn't look like the type who'd keep things tidy like that.
Maya:
You're forgetting, Nick... He's running a pasta shop, here!




Fish pictures







Phoenix:
Wow, there's lots of various fish in Gourd Lake, aren't there!
Maya:
...? Something's funny, Nick. All these fish are saltwater fish.




Fishing pole







Phoenix:
This fishing pole looks expensive.




Table







Maya:
Look, Nick, he has an electric blanket on his table! Looks warm! That's a great idea, we should do that at the office. We can sit down with our clients, snug and warm, and drink hot cocoa!
Phoenix:
And what, talk about murders?
Maya:
Aw, you're a party pooper, Nick!

Wow, he has a television in here, too.

What're you talking about!? This here's the palace of pasta, the "Wet Noodle"! Though, now that you mention it, we haven't gotten many orders for spaghetti lately. All the kids come up and say "Yo dude, we wanna ride in one of your boats!" That's why I keep them boats out there. Youngsters these days... Darned if I understand 'em!
Phoenix:
I'm pretty confused myself.
Maya:
Nick... This isn't going anywhere.

What you saw (appears after presenting Attorney's Badge, then presenting Lake Photo)







Uncle:
I forget the time, but it was pretty dark outside... probably night, ayup.
Phoenix:
(It was after midnight, but okay...)
Uncle:
Then I heard this "bang!" So I looked outside. Then I heard another one. "Bang!" A little while later, this boat comes back. Then a young man walked by my window here. He was mutterin' something to himself, ayup.

Promise to run the Noodle

"Okay, we promise."




We can't promise that

I can't make that promise.

... I-is that any way to treat your old man!? Bah! You want me help? You've come to the wrong man!

Uh oh... now he's grumpy.

Not to mention he still thinks we're his kids. (Maybe we should just lie and say we'll run his shop?)

"Okay, we promise."


Phoenix:
Okay, we promise.

Hey, anything to get the case solved. Also... Who wouldn't want to eat "Phoenix Noodles"?

That's my boy! Good for you, Keith.

Oh, yeah...

The old man who runs it is appearing as a witness in court tomorrow, right?
Gumshoe:
Huh...!? How'd you-- Hmm. That was supposed to be top secret.
Maya:
Do you know who that old man is, Detective?
Gumshoe:
... Actually... I don't. He's a bit of an odd bird... I haven't been able to get a straight answer out of him. I decided first that he wasn't persuasive enough to stand and testify as a witness. That's why we called Ms. Lotta Hart yesterday. As for who he is... We have absolutely no idea.
Maya:
Hmm... sounds suspicious!
Gumshoe:
Hmm...




The DL-6 Incident







Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe, please, help us...
Gumshoe:
H-huh?
Phoenix:
We need to know about the DL-6 Incident!
Gumshoe:
...!
Phoenix:
That was when Edgeworth's father died. I can't help but think that it has something to do with this current case.
Gumshoe:
... To tell the truth, I don't know much about DL-6 either. Mr. Edgeworth forbade us from reading the file. So... I'm afraid I can't show them to you, either, pal.
Maya:
What!?
Gumshoe:
However... If you can convince me somehow that the DL-6 Incident is related to this case... Well, I guess I'd consider opening the file up.Present

Huh? N-no, not at all. Glad it worked out for you.

Glass case







Phoenix:
It looks like there are files inside that glass case. The case is so dusty I can't see what's inside.
Maya:
Nick... it's locked.
Phoenix:
They must keep important case files in there.




Back wall







Phoenix:
There are shelves stuffed with case files in the back of the room, too. Forgotten cases, rotting away for eternity...
Maya:
Nick, let's get what we need and get out of here. All this dust is getting to me!




Cabinet







Phoenix:
This cabinet is where they keep evidence for current cases. Some of the things are obviously murder weapons. Others are... who knows what. Most of it just looks like random junk.
Maya:
Nick... what do you think this clothespin is for?
Phoenix:
Don't touch that! It's evidence...




Shelves







Phoenix:
Here are files of collected case reports. There's quite a large volume of reports here.
Maya:
Wow... these are all case reports!?
Phoenix:
Yeah. It's like a graveyard of police cases.
Maya:
I guess my sister's case report is in here too... quietly gathering dust.Talk









The case summary







Phoenix:
Well, first I have to get a handle on the main facts... like a summary.
Maya:
Right. Summary... summary... Found it! Here you go.
Phoenix:
December 28... 2001.
Maya:
That's exactly 15 years ago from the day after tomorrow!
Phoenix:
(So in two days, the case is closed...) The incident took place in the elevator of the district courthouse. (Changed from [The incident took place in the elevator of the district court.] in the original release)
Maya:
What!? Is this the same district courthouse where we're holding the trial now!? (Changed from [Is this the same district court where we're holding the trial now!?] in the original release)
Phoenix:
Looks like it. There was a large earthquake at 2:00 PM on that day. Part of the court building collapsed, and all of the lights went out.
Maya:
Wow... that was some earthquake!
Phoenix:
At the time, three people were trapped in the elevator. It took five hours for them to be rescued... Five hours!
Maya:
That would be scary like that, in the dark!
Phoenix:
There was a lack of oxygen in the elevator, and the survivors were unconscious.
Maya:
The survivors...?
Phoenix:
One of the three in the elevator had been shot... in the heart.
Maya:
That was Mr. Edgeworth's father... wasn't it.
Phoenix:
(He said that his father was shot before his very eyes... So Miles Edgeworth was one of the other passengers in that elevator.)




Victim data







Phoenix:
Do you have data on the victim... Edgeworth's father?
Maya:
Yeah, hold on... Victim... victim... Here! Found it!
Phoenix:
Gregory Edgeworth, 35, defense attorney. If he were still alive, he'd be 50. He had lost that day's case in court, and got in the elevator with his son, Miles.
Maya:
"Miles"...!
Phoenix:
Miles Edgeworth, of course.
Maya:
So he was on the elevator with his father!
Phoenix:
From the angle of the bullet and the other evidence, it could not have been a suicide... The murder weapon, a pistol, was found in the elevator. The pistol had been fired two times. (Where have I heard that before...? Huh...! It sounds just like this current case! What's going on here?)




Suspect data







Phoenix:
Got any data on the suspect in there?
Maya:
Hmm... that would be the guy that my mom got arrested. Hold on... this is it.
Phoenix:
The man arrested as a suspect in DL-6 was... Yanni Yogi? He was a clerk in the court, apparently.
Maya:
So he must have been the third person in the elevator. Well, then he had to have done it!
Phoenix:
But... he was found innocent. Thanks to his defense lawyer, Robert Hammond.
Maya:
Hammond... the victim in our case!
Phoenix:
Right. The suspect, Mr. Yogi was oxygen deprived... so much so he had brain damage. He lost all memory of being in the elevator. After he was declared innocent, he disappeared.
Maya:
Hmm... where could Yogi have gone to, I wonder?
Phoenix:
(He may be closer than we think...)Present

Let's just hurry up and read these files! This place is so dusty, I want to finish up and get out of here...After clearing all Talk options:Phoenix:
I guess I know generally what happened in DL-6 now. I still don't know what sort of impact the whole thing had on Edgeworth...Maya:
Nick. Are we going to take the whole file? There's too much! We'll never get it out.Phoenix:
Y-you're right. How about we just take what we think we'll need...DL-6 Case File added to the Court Record.Phoenix:
Right. That's probably all we'll be able to find here. Now, all that's left is the trial tomorrow... I wonder how "Dad" will do testifying in court...To be continued.Nothing to examine during investigation

No clues here.Turnabout Goodbyes

Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Miles Edgeworth.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.Karma:
... ...Judge:
Very well, apparently the prosecution is also ready.Phoenix:
(Who is the judge here, anyway!?)Judge:
Mr. von Karma, your opening statement.Karma:
... ...Judge:
Er... very well, no opening statement so...Karma:Karma:
Not so fast, Judge! I was taking a meaningful pause before speaking!Judge:
R-right, of course.Karma:
A prediction! Today's trial will end three minutes from now!Judge:
Order... order! Mr. von Karma! What is the meaning of your statement just now!?Karma:Karma:
Bah! Must you question everything! It will be over in three minutes! We have no time to waste! I'll call my witness now!Judge:
R-right...Karma:
I call my witness... my decisive witness to the stand!Phoenix:
(It's that mysterious boat shop owner.)Karma:
Witness... state your profession.Uncle:
Mmph... zzzz... ... I, er, am the proprietor of the restaurant the "Wet Noodle" at Gourd Lake.Karma:
...Uncle:
And I, er, also rent boats.Karma:
The night of the incident, you were in the boat rental shop, correct?Uncle:
Er... ayup, yup I was.Karma:
Please testify.Phoenix:
(Wait a second... We still haven't heard who this old guy is!)Raise an objection







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Wait a minute!"Let it slide







Phoenix:
(On second thought, I guess it doesn't really matter.)
Maya:
Doesn't matter!? What are you thinking, Nick!? What if that old man had something to do with the DL-6 Incident? If we don't find out who he is, we won't be able to build a case here!
Phoenix:
(Hmm, she has a point.)
Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Wait a minute!"Phoenix:
Wait a minute! The witness hasn't stated his name yet!Karma:Karma:
Because I did not ask him, Mr. Wright! Bah! I have predicted this trial will end in three minutes! Stop asking trivial questions and cooperate!Phoenix:
(Yeah, right!)Judge:
The witness will state his name.Uncle:
Zzzz... ... Mmph! Well, er... I'm not really sure, ayup.Judge:
What do you mean?Uncle:
My, er, memory...Karma:
Your Honor... The witness does not remember anything beyond the last several years... Ergo, he cannot recall his own name.Judge:
Hmm... he can't recall, you say?Karma:
Yes, but the incident in question took place three days ago. He can testify.Judge:
Very well. Let's hear his testimony then, shall we. Witness?Witness Testimony-- The Night of the Murder --Uncle:
It was the night of the 24th, just after midnight, ayup.
I was in the restaurant... where I er... rent boats, as usual.
Then I heard a "bang!" Ayup.
When I looked out the window, I saw a boat just a' floating on the lake.
Then I heard another "bang."
Just about then the boat comes back to the shore, and a man walks by my window.Judge:
Hmm...Very well. I'd like to begin the cross-examination...Karma:Karma:
There is nothing to question in my witness's testimony! Ergo, no need for cross-examination! Besides, there are only 10 seconds left before our three minutes are up! Judge! Your verdict, now!Judge:
Er... yes... M-Mr. Wright...?Cross-examine







Phoenix:
What are you saying!? Of course I'll cross-examine the witness!
Judge:
Hmm... Very well, you may begin.
Leads to:
"Raaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!"Don't cross-examine







Phoenix:
(He's right. That testimony sounded pretty solid. Maybe I should hold back.)
Maya:
B-but, Nick! You have to cross-examine him! This is your only chance to turn this trial around! Your last chance!
Phoenix:
(O-oh... right.)
Leads to:
"Raaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!"Karma:
Raaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!Judge:
E-excuse me? Mr. von Karma?Karma:
Three minutes just passed.Judge:
I see. Well then, let's just take our time. You may cross-examine the witness.Cross Examination-- The Night of the Murder --Uncle:
It was the night of the 24th, just after midnight, ayup.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
"Just after midnight," you say?
Uncle:
Ayup, just around then.
Phoenix:
Are you sure?
Uncle:
Pretty sure, ayup.
Phoenix:
When I talked to you yesterday, you were rather vague about the time... I'm surprised you seem so sure about it today.
Uncle:
...
Karma:

Karma:
I asked him, and he remembered. Isn't that right!?
Uncle:
Zzzz... D-don't glare at me like that...! I, er... I remembered it clearly, I did. Ayup.
Karma:
You see? Continue!Uncle:
I was in the restaurant... where I er... rent boats, as usual.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Is there anyone who can verify that?
Uncle:
... Well, I guess Polly could.
Phoenix:
Th-that's not good enough for a court of law!
Judge:
Mr. Wright... exactly what's not good enough?
Phoenix:
Ah, uh, Your Honor, this "Polly" is a parrot.
Judge:
A... parrot?
Uncle:
Don't be so hard on the girl, Keithy-boy!
Judge:
Keith...?
Karma:

Karma:
The prosecution concedes that we cannot prove the witness was in the shop. Witness... please continue.Uncle:
Then I heard a "bang!" Ayup.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
And where did the "bang" seem to come from?
Uncle:
From the lake, I figure.
Karma:
Are you certain?
Uncle:
A-ayup.
Karma:
Good. Continue!Uncle:
When I looked out the window, I saw a boat just a' floating on the lake.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Was there someone in the boat?
Uncle:
It was pretty far out there... I couldn't see clearly... But I figure there was two men out there, ayup.
Phoenix:
But you couldn't see them clearly!
Uncle:
Ayup... at the time, that is.
Phoenix:
(At the time...?)Uncle:
Then I heard another "bang."Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So you heard two gunshots total?
Uncle:
Ayup.
Phoenix:
(That's what Lotta said in her testimony yesterday.)Uncle:
Just about then the boat comes back to the shore, and a man walks by my window.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
"By your window"?
Uncle:
Ayup, by my window. Right outside the window of my little shack.
Phoenix:
And, could you see the man's face?
Uncle:
Well, the fog was pretty darn thick, but he was right there in front of me. I saw him.
Judge:
This is rather important detail! Please add it to your testimony.
Uncle:
...
Karma:
Tsk, tsk, tsk...
Phoenix:
(I have a bad feeling about this...)
Adds statement "That man was the defendant... he was saying "I can't believe he's dead."Uncle:
That man was the defendant... he was saying "I can't believe he's dead."Press







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"A-are you sure!?"Phoenix:
(If I know von Karma, he spent time preparing his witness. I'm not going to find contradictions very easily in this testimony. Whew... it's tough being a lawyer.)Phoenix:
A-are you sure!?Uncle:
...Phoenix:
(Uh oh!) D-Dad!Uncle:
Dead certain, Keith! He said "I can't believe he's dead" as he was walking by, too.Karma:
Witness! Are you sure that the person you saw was Miles Edgeworth!?Uncle:
It was him! That Edgeworth boy!Judge:
... This... sounds like decisive evidence indeed. I see no room for doubt.Phoenix:
(von Karma... He lured me into cross-examining so he could set me up for a fall!)Karma:
Tsk, tsk, tsk...Maya:
N-Nick...! I don't like the way things are going here! Everyone in the courtroom is glaring at us!Phoenix:
(I'd better act quick, or this trial is going to be over!)Raise an objection







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Your Honor! We proved in yesterday's court that it could not have been Edgeworth who fired the gun!
Karma:

Karma:
Mr. Wright. Are you referring to the fingerprints from Edgeworth's right hand found on the gun, and the photograph showing a man firing with his left hand...?
Phoenix:
Exactly!
Karma:
That is easily explainable! He could have wiped his prints after he fired! You are ignoring the truth of the matter here! Everything in this witness's testimony is true!
Leads to:
"Hmm..."Wait and see what happens







Phoenix:
(But... how can I raise an objection without any proof?)
Karma:
Judge! There is no room for doubt in the witness's testimony! I demand that you declare your verdict!
Leads to:
"Hmm..."Judge:
Hmm...Phoenix:
(The judge is lost in thought... what should I do?)Raise an objection







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Your Honor! This witness claims that Edgeworth said "I can' t believe he's dead"... But his word is all we have! If he were telling a lie...
Karma:

Karma:
Mr. Wright. In a court of law, the evidence tells all. Apparently, you have yet to realize even this basic fact. If you say his testimony is a lie, show us proof!
Phoenix:
Urk...
Maya:
Nick! Do we have evidence...?
Leads to:
"It's no good! There's nothing I can do."Wait and see what happens







Phoenix:
(I can't see any room to raise an objection... I'd better hold back and see how things develop.)
Maya:
Nick! We have to do something! If we stay quiet now, Mr. Edgeworth'll be found guilty for sure!
Leads to:
"It's no good! There's nothing I can do."Phoenix:
It's no good! There's nothing I can do.Maya:
A... are you sure?Phoenix:
To be honest... I don't know what to do anymore.Maya:
Please... Can you hear me, Sis? Please... We need your help... Nick needs you...Karma:
Tsk tsk tsk... Three minutes was perhaps too high an expectation. However, fifteen minutes isn't bad! This must be a new record.Judge:
Enough! The witness may leave the stand.Uncle:
Zzzz...Judge:
This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts.Phoenix:
(W-what!? No!)Karma:
Hmph.Judge:
This court find the defendant, Mr. Miles Edgeworth...GuiltyJudge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!W-w-waaaaaaait!Judge:
Wh-who was that just now?Me!!!Phoenix:
Huh? Waaaaah! L-Larry!Judge:
Wh-what are you doing here!?Butz:
Listen! Y-you gotta listen to me! I... I was...  I was there, in the park, the night of the murder! I... I wasn't sure about it until just yesterday. B-but today I remembered it!Judge:
Remembered what?Butz:
The gunshot! I heard it too!Judge:
O-order!Karma:Karma:
What is the meaning of this!? The verdict has been decided! I call for adjournment!Judge:
One moment, Mr. von Karma. So, you say you heard a gunshot?Butz:
Yeah, I did! A gunshot! That night! I was sitting here in the audience, listening to the testimony... Then I realized, something he said was different from what I remember! A-anyhow, I can't just sit here and let you call Edgey a murderer! It's... It's just not right! I'll testify! Lemme testify!Judge:
Order! Order! Well, this is the first time something has happened like this in my court. I'm not quite sure how to proceed...Karma:
Judge! You've already given your decision! The trial is over!Maya:
Nick! This is it! Larry's given us one final chance at this!Phoenix:
(She's right! If only it wasn't Larry... He could make things even worse...)Maya:
Mr. Edgeworth was just declared guilty, Nick! It doesn't get any worse!Phoenix:
You're right! Okay! Your Honor! If there is another witness, it is our duty to hear him speak! Right here! Right now!Karma:
A waste of time! The verdict cannot be overturned!Judge:
Hmm... ... ... Allow me to speak my opinion. In all court proceedings, it is our duty to prevent an inaccurate verdict. In order to make sure no mistake has been made, every witness should be heard!Karma:
Wh-what is this!?Judge:
I withdraw my previous verdict of "guilty"! Mr. von Karma! I order you to call this new witness to testify. Now!Karma:
Whaaaat!Judge:
The court will adjourn for a five minute recess. After that, we will hear this new witness. Court is adjourned!December 27, 10:28 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2Phoenix:
Whew... That was too close. Sorry to keep you on the edge of your seat like that, Edgeworth.Edgeworth:
Hmph. I've seen worse.Phoenix:
(Yeah right, Edgeworth. You're sweating bullets!) I just wonder what Larry plans to say in there.Maya:
Larry was at the lake that night?Phoenix:
Yes... He said he went looking for the Steel Samurai balloon that flew into the lake.Maya:
Oh right. And he found the balloon and the air tank that night?Phoenix:
Yeah.Edgeworth:
...Phoenix:
Hey, Edgeworth.Edgeworth:
... Huh? You say something, Wright?Phoenix:
Yeah, a lot of things. You seem out of it. What's wrong?Edgeworth:
It... it's nothing.Phoenix:
Hmm?Maya:
Umm... Mr. Edgeworth? There's something I've been meaning to ask you.Edgeworth:
What's that?Maya:
Why are your fingerprints on the murder weapon?Edgeworth:
Oh. When he fell into the lake, I went into a daze. I couldn't understand what had happened. I couldn't think straight. Then I saw the pistol lying on the floor of the boat in front of me. I picked it up without thinking. I didn't have a reason, really.Maya:
I see...Edgeworth:
Wright...Phoenix:
Yeah?Edgeworth:
This might be our chance.Phoenix:
Our chance?Edgeworth:
von Karma has only ever run perfect trials.Phoenix:
Perfect trials...?Edgeworth:
Perfectly prepared witnesses, perfectly complete evidence. That's the secret to his success. This is the first time he's ever had to deal with something unexpected! He has to let someone he hasn't even talked to testify before the court! (Changed from [He has let someone he hasn't even talked to testify before the court!] in the original release) And that someone... is Larry!Phoenix:
What are you getting at?Edgeworth:
It's likely his testimony will be full of holes, Wright.Maya:
That's right, Nick! No ten minute trial this time! We'll milk this one for all it's worth!Phoenix:
Hey, it was fifteen minutes! Fifteen! (Everything's on Larry now...) (Changed from [Hey, it was fifteen minutes! Fifteen! (Everything depends on Larry now...)] in the original release)December 27, 10:35 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3Judge:
Court is now back in session. Witness... Please testify to the court about everything that you saw... on the night of December 24th.Butz:
Right... leave it to me!Phoenix:
(Please, Larry, don't mess this one up!!! I hate to admit it, but you're our last chance!)Karma:
...Phoenix:
(von Karma didn't even have time to prep his witness. I just hope Edgeworth is right about this being our big break...)Witness Testimony-- The Night of the Murder --Butz:
That night, I was out in a boat on the lake.
I was looking for something and I, er, found it.
So I quietly slipped the boat back in at the rental shop dock.
Then, just as I was thinking about going home, I heard this "bang"!
I looked out over the lake, but I didn't notice the boat.
So after I heard that single gunshot I went home.Judge:
Hmm... That was an unusually vague testimony, even for this court. In any matter, Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor...Maya:
What's wrong, Nick?Phoenix:
It's Larry! I have no idea what he's going to say if I press him. I'm a little scared.Maya:
Hmm... Well, we've come this far. There's no way to go but forward, Nick!Cross Examination-- The Night of the Murder --Butz:
That night, I was out in a boat on the lake.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
...
Judge:
Something wrong, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
There were so many things wrong I don't know where to begin...
Judge:
Ah...
Phoenix:
Um, well, okay. First of all, what time was it?
Butz:
Oh, it was after 11:00 when I went out in the boat. By that time everyone had gone home for the night. So I waited until the coast was clear, so to speak.
Phoenix:
And why were you out on a boat at such a late hour...?Butz:
I was looking for something and I, er, found it.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
"Looking for something"...?
Butz:
Er, yeah.
Judge:
Mr. Butz, what was it you were looking for?
Karma:

Karma:
What the witness was searching for is irrelevant! Most likely he was hunting for this "Gourdy"!
Phoenix:
(You know, it wouldn't surprise me one bit if that was the truth.)
Karma:
This is all irrelevant! Let's get it over with.Butz:
So I quietly slipped the boat back in at the rental shop dock.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Around what time was that?
Butz:
Uh... Well, let's see... I figured I was out searching for about an hour... I guess it was around 12:00. Yeah.
Judge:
You're not sure?
Butz:
Hey! Don't give me that face! I'm not some sort of human sundial, okay!?
Phoenix:
(People use watches these days, Larry...)Butz:
Then, just as I was thinking about going home, I heard this "bang"!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Where did the sound come from?
Butz:
Yeah, well, I wasn't too sure about that. I looked around, y'know.
Judge:
Did you look at the lake?
Butz:
Yeah, I looked.Butz:
I looked out over the lake, but I didn't notice the boat.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Wasn't there a boat on the lake!?
Judge:
Order! Order! Well? Mr. Butz!
Butz:
Whoa, whoa. Everybody just calm down, okay? I mean, it was real foggy that night. I'm not sure whether there was a boat out there or not.
Phoenix:
(Oh, okay, no problem. That's just the MOST IMPORTANT PART of the case!!!)
Karma:
Hmph!Butz:
So after I heard that single gunshot I went home.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So, you only heard one "bang" correct?
Butz:
Yeah.
Phoenix:
(Huh.)Present Lotta's Deposition







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"W-wait a sec, Larry!"Maya:
Well, Nick?Phoenix:
Hmm... It was a pretty wishy-washy testimony, wasn't it? I guess I should just start working on the contradictions.Maya:
Sorry...
I wish I could be more helpful. I wish I could call my sister...Phoenix:
W-wait a sec, Larry!Butz:
Wh-what!?Phoenix:
You only heard one "bang"!? You're sure!?Butz:
That's what I said!Phoenix:
But Mr. Lotta Hart testified yesterday that she heard two "bang"s! And the old man just now said the same thing! They both heard two gunshots that night!Butz:
Huh?Phoenix:
Were you even listening!? Were you paying attention at all to what they said?Butz:
Yo, Nick, please!Phoenix:
Huh?Butz:
You know, something's been bothering me. I'm a witness, see? I'm like a customer here! So you got to treat me nice and stuff, okay!?Phoenix:
...Judge:
Mr. Butz.Butz:
What!?Judge:
You only heard one gunshot? Are you sure?Butz:
... Umm... Well, to tell ya the truth... I'm not sure.Judge:
Eh...?Phoenix:
Not sure!? H-how could you not be sure?Butz:
Yeah, well... I, uh, I might have missed the other gunshot. I was, uh, listening to something else...Phoenix:
Something... else?Butz:
My radio, dude! With my headphones. (Changed from [My radio, dude! On my headphones.] in the original release)Phoenix:
Whaaaaaaat!?Judge:
Order! Order! And stop that booing! M-Mr. Butz! You were listening to the radio with your headphones? (Changed from [You were listening to a radio on earphones?] in the original release)Butz:
Y-yeah! So what! That a crime!? I listen to my radio! Everybody listens to the radio! What's the big deal!?Judge:
Hmm... Mr. von Karma... your opinion?Karma:
Waste of time. I do not accept this witness, nor his shoddy testimony.Judge:
Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright? Should he continue the testimony?That's enough







Phoenix:
(No, I think I've heard enough. This is all too embarrassing... In fact, I think we've all heard enough.)
Maya:
What are you saying, Nick!? If you stop now, Mr. Edgeworth will be found guilty! We have to turn this trial around now!
Phoenix:
Uh...
Leads to:
"Your Honor."Continue







Leads to:
"Your Honor."Phoenix:
Your Honor. Please... please allow the witness to continue his testimony.Karma:
Bah! Nothing is more pitiful than a lawyer who doesn't know when he's lost!Judge:
Very well, Mr. Butz. Please give your testimony, and be sure to include details like your RADIO.Butz:
Right! Leave it to me!Phoenix:
(I wouldn't if there were any other way out of this, believe me.)Witness Testimony-- What Larry Heard --Butz:
It's lonely, being alone on Christmas Eve!
That's why I was listening to an all-requests show on the radio, see?
I was listening to it real booming loud, like.
But I'm sure I heard that gunshot!
I remember exactly what the DJ was saying when I heard it, too.Judge:
You were listening to your radio... at a high volume!?Butz:
Yeah, what's the big problem? Can't a man listen to his radio in peace? Isn't this a free country!?Phoenix:
(I truly believe Larry has no idea what the problem here is.)Karma:
Judge. Can you believe a word this witness says? What he heard was probably nothing more than a drum beat from the radio!Judge:
True enough, it is difficult to believe this testimony.Phoenix:Phoenix:
Wait, Your Honor! The witness said he remembers exactly what the DJ said when he heard the gunshot!Judge:
Excuse me? "Dee-jay"...?Phoenix:
An announcer... the guy who says things on the radio. Anyway! What this means is, when he heard the sound, no music was playing! The DJ only talks between songs! So he could have heard the gunshot from the lake! I'd like to cross-examine the witness, Your Honor!Judge:
V-very well, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:
(I can't believe I'm continuing this charade...)Cross Examination

Wright!Phoenix:
Oh, h-hiya, Chief.Mia:
Whew, I'm glad I made it on time. Well, I have to say Phoenix, I'm impressed! Not everyone takes on a murder trial right off the bat like this. It says a lot about you... and your client as well.Phoenix:
Um... thanks. Actually, it's because I owe him a favor.Mia:
A favor? You mean, you knew the defendant before this case?Phoenix:
Yes. Actually, I kind of owe my current job to him. He's one of the reasons I became an attorney.Mia:
Well, that's news to me!Phoenix:
I want to help him out any way I can! I just... really want to help him. I owe him that much.???:
(It's over! My life, everything, it's all over!)Mia:
... Is that your client screaming over there? (Changed from [Isn't that your client screaming over there?] in the original release)Phoenix:
Yeah... it's him. (Changed from [Yeah... that's him.] in the original release)???:
(Death! Despair! Ohhhh! I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna die!!!)Mia:
It sounds like he wants to die...Phoenix:
Um, yeah. *sigh*Butz:
Nick!!!Phoenix:
Hey. Hey there, Larry.Butz:
Dude, I'm so guilty!! Tell them I'm guilty!!! Gimme the death sentence! I ain't afraid to die!Phoenix:
What!? What's wrong, Larry?Butz:
Oh, it's all over... I... I'm finished. Finished! I can't live in a world without her! I can't! Who... who took her away from me, Nick? Who did this!? Aww, Nick, ya gotta tell me! Who took my baby away!?Phoenix:
(Hmm... The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say it was you...)Phoenix:
My name is Phoenix Wright. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: "When something smells, it's usually the Butz." In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!August 3, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz. (Changed from [The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.] in the original release)Payne:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The, um, defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:
Ahem. Mr. Wright? This is your first trial, is it not?Phoenix:
Y-Yes, Your Honor. I'm, um, a little nervous.Judge:
Your conduct during this trial will decide the fate of your client. Murder is a serious charge. For your client's sake, I hope you can control your nerves.Phoenix:
Thank... thank you, Your Honor.Judge:
... Mr. Wright, given the circumstances... I think we should have a test to ascertain your readiness.Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. (Gulp... Hands shaking... Eyesight... fading...)Judge:
This test will consist of a few simple questions. Answer them clearly and concisely. Please state the name of the defendant in this case.Phoenix Wright







Phoenix:
Um... the defendant... is me... right? (Changed from [Um... the defendant... is me, right?] in the original release)
Mia:
Wright! Have you completely lost your mind? Focus! The defendant is the person on trial! You're his lawyer!
Phoenix:
Um, er, eh? Oh yeah, right! Eh heh heh.
Mia:
This is no laughing matter! You did pass the bar, didn't you?
Judge:
Sorry, I couldn't hear your answer. I'll ask once more:
Leads back to:
"Please state the name of the defendant in this case."Larry Butz







Leads to:
"The defendant? Well, that's Larry Butz, Your Honor."Mia Fey







Phoenix:
The, um, defendant? That's... er... Mia Fey?
Mia:
Wrong, Wright. Look, I have to leave. I have to go home. I'm... I'm expecting a delivery.
Phoenix:
Aw, c'mon Chief. There's no need to be going so soon, is there?
Mia:
Listen, Wright! (Changed from [Wright!] in the original release) The defendant is the one on trial--your client! (Changed from [Listen: the defendant is the one on trial--your client!] in the original release) I mean, that's about as basic as you can get!
Phoenix:
(I've put my foot in it this time! I've got to relax!)
Judge:
Sorry, I couldn't hear your answer. I'll ask once more:
Leads back to:
"Please state the name of the defendant in this case."Phoenix:
The defendant? Well, that's Larry Butz, Your Honor.Judge:
Correct. Just keep your wits about you and you'll do fine. Next question: This is a murder trial. Tell me, what's the victim's name?Phoenix:
(Whew, I know this one! Glad I read the case report cover to cover so many times. It's... wait... Uh-oh! No... no way! I forgot! I'm drawing a total blank here!)Mia:
Phoenix! Are you absolutely SURE you're up to this? You don't even know the victim's name!?Phoenix:
Oh, the victim! O-Of course I know the victim's name! I, um, just forgot. ...Temporarily (Changed from [I, um, just forgot. ... Temporarily.] in the original release)Mia:
I think I feel a migraine coming on. Look, the victim's name is listed in the Court Record. Just press [the R Button / Tab] to check it at any time, okay? (Changed from [Just touch the Court Record button to check it at any time, okay?] in the original release) Remember to check it often. Do it for me, please. I'm begging you.Judge:
Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?Mia Fey







Phoenix:
Um... Mia Fey?
Mia:
W-W-What!? How can I be the victim!?
Phoenix:
Oh! Right! Sorry! I, er, it was the first name that popped into my head, and--
Mia:
The Court Record button! Remember to use it when you're in a pinch with [the R Button / Tab]. (Changed from [Remember to use it when you're in a pinch.] in the original release)
Judge:
Let me ask that one again:
Leads back to:
"Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?"Cinder Block







Phoenix:
Oh, um, wasn't it Ms. Block? Ms. Cinder Block?
Judge:
The person in question was a victim of murder, not ill-conceived naming, Mr. Wright.
Mia:
Wright? If you forget something, use [the R Button / Tab] to check the Court Record and jog your memory. (Changed from [If you forget something, [just touch the Court Record button to help you remember.] in the original release) A mistake in court could cost you the case.
Judge:
I'll ask you again:
Leads back to:
"Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?"Cindy Stone







Leads to:
"Um... the victim's name is Cindy Stone."Phoenix:
Um... the victim's name is Cindy Stone.Judge:
Correct. Now, tell me, what was the cause of death? She died because she was...?Poisoned







Phoenix:
Oh, right! Wasn't she, um, poisoned by er... poison?
Judge:
You're asking me!?
Phoenix:
Um... Chief! Help me out!
Mia:
Check the court record. [The R Button / Tab]... remember? (Changed from [Check the court record. The Court Record button... remember?] in the original release)
Phoenix:
(Geez. Give a guy a break!)
Judge:
Let me ask again.
Leads back to:
"She died because she was...?"Hit with a blunt object







Leads to:
"She was struck once, by a blunt object."Strangled







Phoenix:
Right... she was strangled, wasn't she?
Mia:
Please tell me that was you talking to yourself.
Judge:
If you wish to hang yourself, Mr. Wright, you're welcome to, but not inside my courtroom. I suppose there's nothing to do but give you another try:
Leads back to:
"She died because she was...?"Phoenix:
She was struck once, by a blunt object.Judge:
Correct. You've answered all my questions. I see no reason why we shouldn't proceed. You seem much more relaxed, Mr. Wright. Good for you.Phoenix:
Thank you, Your Honor. (Because I don't FEEL relaxed, that's for sure.)Judge:
Well, then... First, a question for the prosecution. Mr. Payne?Payne:
Yes, Your Honor?Judge:
As Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to the court just what that "object" was?Payne:
The murder weapon was this statue of "The Thinker." It was found lying on the floor, next to the victim.Judge:
I see... The court accepts it into evidence. (Changed from [I see... the court accepts it into evidence.] in the original release)Statue added to the Court Record.Mia:
Wright... Be sure to pay attention to any evidence added during the trial. That evidence is the only ammunition you have in court. [Touch the Court Record button / Use the R Button] to check the Court Record frequently.Judge:
Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its first witness.Payne:
The prosecution calls the defendant, Mr. Butz, to the stand.Phoenix:
Um, Chief, what do I do now?Mia:
Pay attention. You don't want to miss any information that might help your client's case. You'll get your chance to respond to the prosecution later, so be ready! Let's just hope he doesn't say anything... unfortunate.Phoenix:
(Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... This could be bad.) (Changed from [Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... this could be bad.] in the original release)Payne:
Ahem. Mr. Butz. Is it not true that the victim had recently dumped you?Butz:
Hey, watch it buddy! We were great together! We were Romeo and Juliet, Cleopatra and Mark Anthony!Phoenix:
(Um... didn't they all die?)Butz:
I wasn't dumped! She just wasn't taking my phone calls. Or seeing me... Ever. WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?Payne:
Mr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by "dumped." In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!Butz:
Whaddya mean, "one of them"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!Payne:
Your Honor, the victim's passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.Passport added to the Court Record.Judge:
Hmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.Butz:
Dude... no way...Payne:
The victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several "Sugar Daddies."Butz:
Daddies? Sugar?Payne:
Yes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.Butz:
Duuude!Payne:
We can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?Mia:
Wright... I don't think you want him to answer that question.Phoenix:
(Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)Wait and see what happens







Phoenix:
(Might be better not to get involved in this one...)
Payne:
Well, Mr. Butz?
Butz:
Dude, no way! That cheatin' she-dog!
Leads to:
"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!"Stop him from answering







Phoenix:
My client had no idea the victim was seeing other men! That question is irrelevant to this case!
Payne:
Oof! *wince*
Butz:
Dude! Nick! Whaddya mean, "irrelevant"!? That cheatin' she-dog!
Leads to:
"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!"Butz:
I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I'm going to get to the bottom of this!Judge:
Let's continue with the trial, shall we?Payne:
I believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.Judge:
Yes, quite.Phoenix:
(Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)Payne:
Next question! You went to the victim's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?Butz:
Gulp!Payne:
Well, did you, or did you not?Butz:
Heh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn't!Phoenix:
(Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)Have him answer honestly







Phoenix:
(I know! I'll send him a signal...)

(TELL THE TRUTH)

Butz:
Er... Yeah! Yeah! I was there! I went!
Judge:
Order! Well, Mr. Butz?
Butz:
Dude, chill! She wasn't home, man... So, like, I didn't see her.
Payne:

Payne:
Your Honor, the defendant is lying.
Judge:
Lying?
Payne:
The prosecution would like to call a witness who can prove Mr. Butz is lying.
Leads to:
"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"Stop him from answering







Phoenix:
(I'll send him a signal...)

(LIE LIKE A DOG)

Butz:
Um, well, see, it's like this: I don't remember.
Payne:
You "don't remember"? Well then, we'll just have to remind you!
Phoenix:
(I got a bad feeling about this...)
Payne:
We have a witness that can prove he DID go to the victim's apartment that day!
Leads to:
"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"Judge:
Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?Payne:
The man who found the victim's body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw the defendant fleeing the scene of the crime!Judge:
Order! Order in the court! Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.Payne:
Yes, Your Honor.Phoenix:
(This is bad...)Payne:
On the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim's building. Please bring Mr. Frank Sahwit to the stand!Payne:
Mr. Sahwit, you sell newspaper subscriptions, is this correct?Sahwit:
Oh, oh yes! Newspapers, yes!Judge:
Mr. Sahwit, you may proceed with your testimony. Please tell the court what you saw on the day of the murder.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Sahwit:
I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.
I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.
Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.
Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!
I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.
I thought to call the police immediately!
However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.
I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.
I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.
The man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Judge:
Hmm...Phoenix:
(Larry! Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!)Judge:
Incidentally, why wasn't the phone in the victim's apartment working?Payne:
Your Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.Judge:
Aren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?Payne:
Yes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.Blackout Record added to the Court Record.Judge:
Now, Mr. Wright...Phoenix:
Yes! Er... yes, Your Honor?Judge:
You may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:
C-Cross-examination, Your Honor?Mia:
Alright, Wright, this is it. The real deal!Phoenix:
Uh... what exactly am I supposed to do?Mia:
Why, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!Phoenix:
Lies! What?! He was lying!?Mia:
Your client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?Phoenix:
!!! How do I prove he's not?Mia:
You hold the key! It's in the evidence! Compare the witness's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there! First, find contradictions between the Court Record and the witness's testimony. Then, once you've found the contradicting evidence... present it and rub it in the witness's face!Phoenix:
Um... okay.Mia:
Open the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab], then point out contradictions in the testimony! (Changed from [Touch the Court Record button and point out contradictions in the testimony!] in the original release)Cross Examination

Well, then... First, a question for the prosecution. Mr. Payne?Payne:
Yes, Your Honor?Judge:
As Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to the court just what that "object" was?Payne:
The murder weapon was this statue of "The Thinker." It was found lying on the floor, next to the victim.Judge:
I see... The court accepts it into evidence. (Changed from [I see... the court accepts it into evidence.] in the original release)Statue added to the Court Record.Mia:
Wright... Be sure to pay attention to any evidence added during the trial. That evidence is the only ammunition you have in court. [Touch the Court Record button / Use the R Button] to check the Court Record frequently.Judge:
Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its first witness.Payne:
The prosecution calls the defendant, Mr. Butz, to the stand.Phoenix:
Um, Chief, what do I do now?Mia:
Pay attention. You don't want to miss any information that might help your client's case. You'll get your chance to respond to the prosecution later, so be ready! Let's just hope he doesn't say anything... unfortunate.Phoenix:
(Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... This could be bad.) (Changed from [Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... this could be bad.] in the original release)Payne:
Ahem. Mr. Butz. Is it not true that the victim had recently dumped you?Butz:
Hey, watch it buddy! We were great together! We were Romeo and Juliet, Cleopatra and Mark Anthony!Phoenix:
(Um... didn't they all die?)Butz:
I wasn't dumped! She just wasn't taking my phone calls. Or seeing me... Ever. WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?Payne:
Mr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by "dumped." In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!Butz:
Whaddya mean, "one of them"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!Payne:
Your Honor, the victim's passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.Passport added to the Court Record.Judge:
Hmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.Butz:
Dude... no way...Payne:
The victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several "Sugar Daddies."Butz:
Daddies? Sugar?Payne:
Yes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.Butz:
Duuude!Payne:
We can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?Mia:
Wright... I don't think you want him to answer that question.Phoenix:
(Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)Wait and see what happens







Phoenix:
(Might be better not to get involved in this one...)
Payne:
Well, Mr. Butz?
Butz:
Dude, no way! That cheatin' she-dog!
Leads to:
"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!"Stop him from answering







Phoenix:
My client had no idea the victim was seeing other men! That question is irrelevant to this case!
Payne:
Oof! *wince*
Butz:
Dude! Nick! Whaddya mean, "irrelevant"!? That cheatin' she-dog!
Leads to:
"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!"Butz:
I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I'm going to get to the bottom of this!Judge:
Let's continue with the trial, shall we?Payne:
I believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.Judge:
Yes, quite.Phoenix:
(Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)Payne:
Next question! You went to the victim's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?Butz:
Gulp!Payne:
Well, did you, or did you not?Butz:
Heh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn't!Phoenix:
(Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)Have him answer honestly







Phoenix:
(I know! I'll send him a signal...)

(TELL THE TRUTH)

Butz:
Er... Yeah! Yeah! I was there! I went!
Judge:
Order! Well, Mr. Butz?
Butz:
Dude, chill! She wasn't home, man... So, like, I didn't see her.
Payne:

Payne:
Your Honor, the defendant is lying.
Judge:
Lying?
Payne:
The prosecution would like to call a witness who can prove Mr. Butz is lying.
Leads to:
"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"Stop him from answering







Phoenix:
(I'll send him a signal...)

(LIE LIKE A DOG)

Butz:
Um, well, see, it's like this: I don't remember.
Payne:
You "don't remember"? Well then, we'll just have to remind you!
Phoenix:
(I got a bad feeling about this...)
Payne:
We have a witness that can prove he DID go to the victim's apartment that day!
Leads to:
"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"Judge:
Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?Payne:
The man who found the victim's body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw the defendant fleeing the scene of the crime!Judge:
Order! Order in the court! Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.Payne:
Yes, Your Honor.Phoenix:
(This is bad...)Payne:
On the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim's building. Please bring Mr. Frank Sahwit to the stand!Payne:
Mr. Sahwit, you sell newspaper subscriptions, is this correct?Sahwit:
Oh, oh yes! Newspapers, yes!Judge:
Mr. Sahwit, you may proceed with your testimony. Please tell the court what you saw on the day of the murder.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Sahwit:
I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.
I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.
Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.
Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!
I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.
I thought to call the police immediately!
However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.
I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.
I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.
The man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Judge:
Hmm...Phoenix:
(Larry! Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!)Judge:
Incidentally, why wasn't the phone in the victim's apartment working?Payne:
Your Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.Judge:
Aren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?Payne:
Yes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.Blackout Record added to the Court Record.Judge:
Now, Mr. Wright...Phoenix:
Yes! Er... yes, Your Honor?Judge:
You may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:
C-Cross-examination, Your Honor?Mia:
Alright, Wright, this is it. The real deal!Phoenix:
Uh... what exactly am I supposed to do?Mia:
Why, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!Phoenix:
Lies! What?! He was lying!?Mia:
Your client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?Phoenix:
!!! How do I prove he's not?Mia:
You hold the key! It's in the evidence! Compare the witness's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there! First, find contradictions between the Court Record and the witness's testimony. Then, once you've found the contradicting evidence... present it and rub it in the witness's face!Phoenix:
Um... okay.Mia:
Open the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab], then point out contradictions in the testimony! (Changed from [Touch the Court Record button and point out contradictions in the testimony!] in the original release)Cross Examination-- Witness's Account --Sahwit:
I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Isn't a man leaving an apartment a common sight? I find it odd you would take notice of him...
Sahwit:
Er... heh. I don't know. He just seemed strange to me, that's all. Like he was mad, and yet frightened at the same time. Just like... a criminal fleeing the scene of a crime!
Phoenix:
The defense requests that the witness refrain from conjecture!
Payne:
Of course. What the witness means is that the man he saw looked suspicious. So, what happened next?Sahwit:
I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Half-open... you say?
Sahwit:
Yes, yes, the door was open halfway. Yes. I watched for a moment, but no one came to close the door. "That's odd, in a big city like this," I thought...
Payne:
I see. And what happened next?Sahwit:
Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What gave you the idea to do that?
Sahwit:
Well, the door was half-open, you see. Isn't it only human to want to... peek? We climb mountains because they are there! It's the same thing.
Payne:
Truer words have never been spoken! Anyone would look inside!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... why did Payne cut him off so quickly?)
Payne:
So you looked into the apartment. What happened then?Sahwit:
Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Are you sure she was dead?
Sahwit:
W-Well, no, I guess I wasn't. But, she wasn't moving at all, and there was blood everywhere.
Phoenix:
(I guess that would look fatal to anyone...) Very well, what happened next?Sahwit:
I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So, you didn't touch ANYTHING in the apartment?
Sahwit:
Um, yes. I mean no! Nothing.
Phoenix:
Okay. What happened next?Sahwit:
I thought to call the police immediately!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
You "thought" to call the police? Does that mean you didn't actually call them!?
Payne:
Please, please... Listen to the rest of the testimony. You thought to call the police... What happened next?Sahwit:
However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
The phone in her apartment wasn't working?
Sahwit:
Yes. I mean, no. No, it wasn't. Right. (Changed from [Yes. I mean, no, no it wasn't. Right.] in the original release)
Phoenix:
But you said you didn't go into the apartment... or did you!?
Sahwit:
Oh, oh, that? I can explain that! There was a cordless phone on a shelf in the entranceway. I reached inside and tried using that to call...
Payne:
And the phone wasn't working, correct? What happened next?Sahwit:
I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Why use a public phone?
Sahwit:
Well, you see, I don't have a cell phone. And, being the middle of the afternoon, there was no answer at the nearby apartments.
Phoenix:
Ah, right... what time did you call again?Sahwit:
I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
1:00 PM! Are you certain?
Sahwit:
Yes. Absolutely.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... He seems really confident.)
Mia:
1:00 PM? Wright. Doesn't that seem strange to you? Present some evidence to contradict him!Present Cindy's Autopsy Report







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"You found the body at 1:00 PM. You're sure?"Sahwit:
The man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Are you absolutely, 100% positive?
Sahwit:
Yes, it was him. No mistake about it.
Payne:
The witness says he's certain!Mia:
That's all of it. There must be a contradiction in there somewhere. Examine the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab] if something strikes you as being suspicious. (Changed from [Examine the Court Record button if something strikes you as being suspicious.] in the original release) Then, find the evidence that contradicts his testimony, and present it to the court!Phoenix:
You found the body at 1:00 PM. You're sure?Sahwit:
Yes. It was 1:00 PM, for certain.Phoenix:
Frankly, I find that hard to believe! Your statement directly contradicts the autopsy report. The autopsy notes the time of death at sometime after 4PM. There was nobody to... er... no "body" to find at 1:00 PM! How do you explain this three-hour gap?Sahwit:
!!! Oh, that! Oh, er...Payne:Payne:
This is trivial! The witness merely forgot the time!Judge:
After his testimony, I find that hard to believe. Mr. Sahwit... Why were you so certain that you found the body at 1:00 PM?Sahwit:
I... er... well, I... Gee, that's a really good question!Mia:
Great job, Wright! Way to put him on the spot! That's all you have to do: point out contradictions! Lies always beget more lies! See through one, and their whole story falls apart!Sahwit:
Wait! I remember now!Judge:
Would you care to give your testimony again?Witness Testimony-- The Time of Discovery --Sahwit:
You see, when I found the body, I heard the time.
There was a voice saying the time... It was probably coming from the television.
Oh, but it was three hours off, wasn't it?
I guess the victim must have been watching a video of a taped program!
That's why I thought it was 1:00 PM!
Terribly sorry about the misunderstanding...Judge:
Hmm... I see. You heard a voice saying the time on a taped program. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Mia:
Wright! You know what to do!Phoenix:
I've got this one.Cross Examination

I'll make it look like HE did it!August 3, 9:47 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2Phoenix:
(Boy am I nervous!)Mia:
Wright!Phoenix:
Oh, h-hiya, Chief.Mia:
Whew, I'm glad I made it on time. Well, I have to say Phoenix, I'm impressed! Not everyone takes on a murder trial right off the bat like this. It says a lot about you... and your client as well.Phoenix:
Um... thanks. Actually, it's because I owe him a favor.Mia:
A favor? You mean, you knew the defendant before this case?Phoenix:
Yes. Actually, I kind of owe my current job to him. He's one of the reasons I became an attorney.Mia:
Well, that's news to me!Phoenix:
I want to help him out any way I can! I just... really want to help him. I owe him that much.???:
(It's over! My life, everything, it's all over!)Mia:
... Is that your client screaming over there? (Changed from [Isn't that your client screaming over there?] in the original release)Phoenix:
Yeah... it's him. (Changed from [Yeah... that's him.] in the original release)???:
(Death! Despair! Ohhhh! I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna die!!!)Mia:
It sounds like he wants to die...Phoenix:
Um, yeah. *sigh*Butz:
Nick!!!Phoenix:
Hey. Hey there, Larry.Butz:
Dude, I'm so guilty!! Tell them I'm guilty!!! Gimme the death sentence! I ain't afraid to die!Phoenix:
What!? What's wrong, Larry?Butz:
Oh, it's all over... I... I'm finished. Finished! I can't live in a world without her! I can't! Who... who took her away from me, Nick? Who did this!? Aww, Nick, ya gotta tell me! Who took my baby away!?Phoenix:
(Hmm... The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say it was you...)Phoenix:
My name is Phoenix Wright. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: "When something smells, it's usually the Butz." In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!August 3, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz. (Changed from [The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.] in the original release)Payne:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The, um, defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:
Ahem. Mr. Wright? This is your first trial, is it not?Phoenix:
Y-Yes, Your Honor. I'm, um, a little nervous.Judge:
Your conduct during this trial will decide the fate of your client. Murder is a serious charge. For your client's sake, I hope you can control your nerves.Phoenix:
Thank... thank you, Your Honor.Judge:
... Mr. Wright, given the circumstances... I think we should have a test to ascertain your readiness.Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. (Gulp... Hands shaking... Eyesight... fading...)Judge:
This test will consist of a few simple questions. Answer them clearly and concisely. Please state the name of the defendant in this case.Phoenix Wright







Phoenix:
Um... the defendant... is me... right? (Changed from [Um... the defendant... is me, right?] in the original release)
Mia:
Wright! Have you completely lost your mind? Focus! The defendant is the person on trial! You're his lawyer!
Phoenix:
Um, er, eh? Oh yeah, right! Eh heh heh.
Mia:
This is no laughing matter! You did pass the bar, didn't you?
Judge:
Sorry, I couldn't hear your answer. I'll ask once more:
Leads back to:
"Please state the name of the defendant in this case."Larry Butz







Leads to:
"The defendant? Well, that's Larry Butz, Your Honor."Mia Fey







Phoenix:
The, um, defendant? That's... er... Mia Fey?
Mia:
Wrong, Wright. Look, I have to leave. I have to go home. I'm... I'm expecting a delivery.
Phoenix:
Aw, c'mon Chief. There's no need to be going so soon, is there?
Mia:
Listen, Wright! (Changed from [Wright!] in the original release) The defendant is the one on trial--your client! (Changed from [Listen: the defendant is the one on trial--your client!] in the original release) I mean, that's about as basic as you can get!
Phoenix:
(I've put my foot in it this time! I've got to relax!)
Judge:
Sorry, I couldn't hear your answer. I'll ask once more:
Leads back to:
"Please state the name of the defendant in this case."Phoenix:
The defendant? Well, that's Larry Butz, Your Honor.Judge:
Correct. Just keep your wits about you and you'll do fine. Next question: This is a murder trial. Tell me, what's the victim's name?Phoenix:
(Whew, I know this one! Glad I read the case report cover to cover so many times. It's... wait... Uh-oh! No... no way! I forgot! I'm drawing a total blank here!)Mia:
Phoenix! Are you absolutely SURE you're up to this? You don't even know the victim's name!?Phoenix:
Oh, the victim! O-Of course I know the victim's name! I, um, just forgot. ...Temporarily (Changed from [I, um, just forgot. ... Temporarily.] in the original release)Mia:
I think I feel a migraine coming on. Look, the victim's name is listed in the Court Record. Just press [the R Button / Tab] to check it at any time, okay? (Changed from [Just touch the Court Record button to check it at any time, okay?] in the original release) Remember to check it often. Do it for me, please. I'm begging you.Judge:
Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?Mia Fey







Phoenix:
Um... Mia Fey?
Mia:
W-W-What!? How can I be the victim!?
Phoenix:
Oh! Right! Sorry! I, er, it was the first name that popped into my head, and--
Mia:
The Court Record button! Remember to use it when you're in a pinch with [the R Button / Tab]. (Changed from [Remember to use it when you're in a pinch.] in the original release)
Judge:
Let me ask that one again:
Leads back to:
"Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?"Cinder Block







Phoenix:
Oh, um, wasn't it Ms. Block? Ms. Cinder Block?
Judge:
The person in question was a victim of murder, not ill-conceived naming, Mr. Wright.
Mia:
Wright? If you forget something, use [the R Button / Tab] to check the Court Record and jog your memory. (Changed from [If you forget something, [just touch the Court Record button to help you remember.] in the original release) A mistake in court could cost you the case.
Judge:
I'll ask you again:
Leads back to:
"Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?"Cindy Stone







Leads to:
"Um... the victim's name is Cindy Stone."Phoenix:
Um... the victim's name is Cindy Stone.Judge:
Correct. Now, tell me, what was the cause of death? She died because she was...?Poisoned







Phoenix:
Oh, right! Wasn't she, um, poisoned by er... poison?
Judge:
You're asking me!?
Phoenix:
Um... Chief! Help me out!
Mia:
Check the court record. [The R Button / Tab]... remember? (Changed from [Check the court record. The Court Record button... remember?] in the original release)
Phoenix:
(Geez. Give a guy a break!)
Judge:
Let me ask again.
Leads back to:
"She died because she was...?"Hit with a blunt object







Leads to:
"She was struck once, by a blunt object."Strangled







Phoenix:
Right... she was strangled, wasn't she?
Mia:
Please tell me that was you talking to yourself.
Judge:
If you wish to hang yourself, Mr. Wright, you're welcome to, but not inside my courtroom. I suppose there's nothing to do but give you another try:
Leads back to:
"She died because she was...?"Phoenix:
She was struck once, by a blunt object.Judge:
Correct. You've answered all my questions. I see no reason why we shouldn't proceed. You seem much more relaxed, Mr. Wright. Good for you.Phoenix:
Thank you, Your Honor. (Because I don't FEEL relaxed, that's for sure.)Judge:
Well, then... First, a question for the prosecution. Mr. Payne?Payne:
Yes, Your Honor?Judge:
As Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to the court just what that "object" was?Payne:
The murder weapon was this statue of "The Thinker." It was found lying on the floor, next to the victim.Judge:
I see... The court accepts it into evidence. (Changed from [I see... the court accepts it into evidence.] in the original release)Statue added to the Court Record.Mia:
Wright... Be sure to pay attention to any evidence added during the trial. That evidence is the only ammunition you have in court. [Touch the Court Record button / Use the R Button] to check the Court Record frequently.Judge:
Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its first witness.Payne:
The prosecution calls the defendant, Mr. Butz, to the stand.Phoenix:
Um, Chief, what do I do now?Mia:
Pay attention. You don't want to miss any information that might help your client's case. You'll get your chance to respond to the prosecution later, so be ready! Let's just hope he doesn't say anything... unfortunate.Phoenix:
(Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... This could be bad.) (Changed from [Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... this could be bad.] in the original release)Payne:
Ahem. Mr. Butz. Is it not true that the victim had recently dumped you?Butz:
Hey, watch it buddy! We were great together! We were Romeo and Juliet, Cleopatra and Mark Anthony!Phoenix:
(Um... didn't they all die?)Butz:
I wasn't dumped! She just wasn't taking my phone calls. Or seeing me... Ever. WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?Payne:
Mr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by "dumped." In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!Butz:
Whaddya mean, "one of them"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!Payne:
Your Honor, the victim's passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.Passport added to the Court Record.Judge:
Hmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.Butz:
Dude... no way...Payne:
The victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several "Sugar Daddies."Butz:
Daddies? Sugar?Payne:
Yes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.Butz:
Duuude!Payne:
We can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?Mia:
Wright... I don't think you want him to answer that question.Phoenix:
(Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)Wait and see what happens







Phoenix:
(Might be better not to get involved in this one...)
Payne:
Well, Mr. Butz?
Butz:
Dude, no way! That cheatin' she-dog!
Leads to:
"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!"Stop him from answering







Phoenix:
My client had no idea the victim was seeing other men! That question is irrelevant to this case!
Payne:
Oof! *wince*
Butz:
Dude! Nick! Whaddya mean, "irrelevant"!? That cheatin' she-dog!
Leads to:
"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!"Butz:
I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I'm going to get to the bottom of this!Judge:
Let's continue with the trial, shall we?Payne:
I believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.Judge:
Yes, quite.Phoenix:
(Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)Payne:
Next question! You went to the victim's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?Butz:
Gulp!Payne:
Well, did you, or did you not?Butz:
Heh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn't!Phoenix:
(Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)Have him answer honestly







Phoenix:
(I know! I'll send him a signal...)

(TELL THE TRUTH)

Butz:
Er... Yeah! Yeah! I was there! I went!
Judge:
Order! Well, Mr. Butz?
Butz:
Dude, chill! She wasn't home, man... So, like, I didn't see her.
Payne:

Payne:
Your Honor, the defendant is lying.
Judge:
Lying?
Payne:
The prosecution would like to call a witness who can prove Mr. Butz is lying.
Leads to:
"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"Stop him from answering







Phoenix:
(I'll send him a signal...)

(LIE LIKE A DOG)

Butz:
Um, well, see, it's like this: I don't remember.
Payne:
You "don't remember"? Well then, we'll just have to remind you!
Phoenix:
(I got a bad feeling about this...)
Payne:
We have a witness that can prove he DID go to the victim's apartment that day!
Leads to:
"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"Judge:
Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?Payne:
The man who found the victim's body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw the defendant fleeing the scene of the crime!Judge:
Order! Order in the court! Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.Payne:
Yes, Your Honor.Phoenix:
(This is bad...)Payne:
On the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim's building. Please bring Mr. Frank Sahwit to the stand!Payne:
Mr. Sahwit, you sell newspaper subscriptions, is this correct?Sahwit:
Oh, oh yes! Newspapers, yes!Judge:
Mr. Sahwit, you may proceed with your testimony. Please tell the court what you saw on the day of the murder.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Sahwit:
I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.
I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.
Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.
Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!
I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.
I thought to call the police immediately!
However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.
I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.
I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.
The man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Judge:
Hmm...Phoenix:
(Larry! Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!)Judge:
Incidentally, why wasn't the phone in the victim's apartment working?Payne:
Your Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.Judge:
Aren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?Payne:
Yes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.Blackout Record added to the Court Record.Judge:
Now, Mr. Wright...Phoenix:
Yes! Er... yes, Your Honor?Judge:
You may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:
C-Cross-examination, Your Honor?Mia:
Alright, Wright, this is it. The real deal!Phoenix:
Uh... what exactly am I supposed to do?Mia:
Why, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!Phoenix:
Lies! What?! He was lying!?Mia:
Your client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?Phoenix:
!!! How do I prove he's not?Mia:
You hold the key! It's in the evidence! Compare the witness's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there! First, find contradictions between the Court Record and the witness's testimony. Then, once you've found the contradicting evidence... present it and rub it in the witness's face!Phoenix:
Um... okay.Mia:
Open the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab], then point out contradictions in the testimony! (Changed from [Touch the Court Record button and point out contradictions in the testimony!] in the original release)Cross Examination-- Witness's Account --Sahwit:
I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Isn't a man leaving an apartment a common sight? I find it odd you would take notice of him...
Sahwit:
Er... heh. I don't know. He just seemed strange to me, that's all. Like he was mad, and yet frightened at the same time. Just like... a criminal fleeing the scene of a crime!
Phoenix:
The defense requests that the witness refrain from conjecture!
Payne:
Of course. What the witness means is that the man he saw looked suspicious. So, what happened next?Sahwit:
I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Half-open... you say?
Sahwit:
Yes, yes, the door was open halfway. Yes. I watched for a moment, but no one came to close the door. "That's odd, in a big city like this," I thought...
Payne:
I see. And what happened next?Sahwit:
Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What gave you the idea to do that?
Sahwit:
Well, the door was half-open, you see. Isn't it only human to want to... peek? We climb mountains because they are there! It's the same thing.
Payne:
Truer words have never been spoken! Anyone would look inside!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... why did Payne cut him off so quickly?)
Payne:
So you looked into the apartment. What happened then?Sahwit:
Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Are you sure she was dead?
Sahwit:
W-Well, no, I guess I wasn't. But, she wasn't moving at all, and there was blood everywhere.
Phoenix:
(I guess that would look fatal to anyone...) Very well, what happened next?Sahwit:
I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So, you didn't touch ANYTHING in the apartment?
Sahwit:
Um, yes. I mean no! Nothing.
Phoenix:
Okay. What happened next?Sahwit:
I thought to call the police immediately!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
You "thought" to call the police? Does that mean you didn't actually call them!?
Payne:
Please, please... Listen to the rest of the testimony. You thought to call the police... What happened next?Sahwit:
However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
The phone in her apartment wasn't working?
Sahwit:
Yes. I mean, no. No, it wasn't. Right. (Changed from [Yes. I mean, no, no it wasn't. Right.] in the original release)
Phoenix:
But you said you didn't go into the apartment... or did you!?
Sahwit:
Oh, oh, that? I can explain that! There was a cordless phone on a shelf in the entranceway. I reached inside and tried using that to call...
Payne:
And the phone wasn't working, correct? What happened next?Sahwit:
I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Why use a public phone?
Sahwit:
Well, you see, I don't have a cell phone. And, being the middle of the afternoon, there was no answer at the nearby apartments.
Phoenix:
Ah, right... what time did you call again?Sahwit:
I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
1:00 PM! Are you certain?
Sahwit:
Yes. Absolutely.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... He seems really confident.)
Mia:
1:00 PM? Wright. Doesn't that seem strange to you? Present some evidence to contradict him!Present Cindy's Autopsy Report







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"You found the body at 1:00 PM. You're sure?"Sahwit:
The man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Are you absolutely, 100% positive?
Sahwit:
Yes, it was him. No mistake about it.
Payne:
The witness says he's certain!Mia:
That's all of it. There must be a contradiction in there somewhere. Examine the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab] if something strikes you as being suspicious. (Changed from [Examine the Court Record button if something strikes you as being suspicious.] in the original release) Then, find the evidence that contradicts his testimony, and present it to the court!Phoenix:
You found the body at 1:00 PM. You're sure?Sahwit:
Yes. It was 1:00 PM, for certain.Phoenix:
Frankly, I find that hard to believe! Your statement directly contradicts the autopsy report. The autopsy notes the time of death at sometime after 4PM. There was nobody to... er... no "body" to find at 1:00 PM! How do you explain this three-hour gap?Sahwit:
!!! Oh, that! Oh, er...Payne:Payne:
This is trivial! The witness merely forgot the time!Judge:
After his testimony, I find that hard to believe. Mr. Sahwit... Why were you so certain that you found the body at 1:00 PM?Sahwit:
I... er... well, I... Gee, that's a really good question!Mia:
Great job, Wright! Way to put him on the spot! That's all you have to do: point out contradictions! Lies always beget more lies! See through one, and their whole story falls apart!Sahwit:
Wait! I remember now!Judge:
Would you care to give your testimony again?Witness Testimony-- The Time of Discovery --Sahwit:
You see, when I found the body, I heard the time.
There was a voice saying the time... It was probably coming from the television.
Oh, but it was three hours off, wasn't it?
I guess the victim must have been watching a video of a taped program!
That's why I thought it was 1:00 PM!
Terribly sorry about the misunderstanding...Judge:
Hmm... I see. You heard a voice saying the time on a taped program. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Mia:
Wright! You know what to do!Phoenix:
I've got this one.Cross Examination-- The Time of Discovery --Sahwit:
You see, when I found the body, I heard the time.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
You said "heard"... Not "saw"?
Sahwit:
Yes, heard. All I saw was the body lying there... I didn't think to look at anything else, least of all my watch.
Phoenix:
Hmm... Isn't that a little strange? So you're saying you "heard" something. But if you were so shocked by the body, you wouldn't hear anything at all!
Payne:

Payne:
The witness did say he actually heard the time. It's ludicrous to suggest he "wouldn't hear anything"!
Judge:
Hmm... I have to agree with the prosecution. Witness, continue your testimony.Present Blackout Record







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Hold it right there!"Sahwit:
There was a voice saying the time... It was probably coming from the television.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Are you sure it was a television and not... a radio?
Sahwit:
Well, no, I guess it might have been a radio.
Payne:
Incidentally, there was no radio on the premises. There was only one large television.
Mia:
Wright! I can't put my finger on it, but something about this seems fishy. Something about "hearing" the television...
Payne:
The witness has testified. He heard the time.Present Blackout Record

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
A... video?
Sahwit:
Yes, that would explain why the time was wrong!

Are you sure the voice you heard said it was 1:00 PM?
Sahwit:
Yes, I can practically hear it now. It was quite clear.
Judge:
Mr. Payne, has the prosecution verified this testimony?
Payne:
My apologies, Your Honor. I, too, have only just learned that the witness "heard" the time.
Sahwit:
Oh, I'm really sorry. I only remembered it just now.Present Blackout Record

Terribly sorry about the misunderstanding...Press







Phoenix:

Well, you just watch it! (Hmm... Not much point pressing him on that one, was there?)Mia:
Notice anything suspicious?Phoenix:
Hold it right there! The prosecution has said there was a blackout at the time of the discovery! And this record proves it!Sahwit:
...!Phoenix:
You couldn't have heard a television... or a video!Sahwit:
Gah!!! I... well... urk!Judge:
The defense has a point. Do you have an explanation for this, Mr. Sahwit?Sahwit:
No, I... I find it quite puzzling myself! Quite! ... Aah! W-wait! I remember now!Judge:
Mr. Sahwit? The court would prefer to hear an accurate testimony from the very beginning. These constant corrections are harming your credibility. That, and you seem rather... distraught.Sahwit:
...! M-my apologies, Your Honor! It... er, it must have been the shock of finding the body!Judge:
Very well, Mr. Sahwit. Let's hear your testimony once more please.Witness Testimony-- Hearing the Time --Sahwit:
Actually, I didn't "hear" the time... I "saw" it!
There was a table clock in the apartment, wasn't there!
Yeah, the murder weapon! The killer used it to hit the victim!
That must have been what I saw.Judge:
You saw a clock? I guess that would explain it. The defense may cross-examine the witness.Phoenix:
Gladly.Cross Examination

That's enough! This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts.I-It wasn't me! I swear it wasn't me!Judge:
The evidence and testimony we have seen and heard are conclusive! The victim was alone at his table when he drank from that poisoned cup of coffee.No! You're wrong! I know what I saw...! I saw... I saw...! I saw someone else there! A man. He's the real killer! Why won't anyone believe me?Payne:
Well... I'd say that pretty much wraps this case up, wouldn't you... ...Mr. Wright!?Judge:

Ahh! The start of the new year always makes me feel like I can take on the whole world!Phoenix:
I bet it does, Maya.Maya:
So! I've decided that our resolution should be... Zvarri! "Take on the world!" What do you think?Phoenix:
Sure, whatever, Maya... But I think maybe you've had more than enough mistletoe cake.Maya:
Never! You've got to eat a lot of cake during New Year's! It's practically a tradition! Like watching the fireworks on TV or playing a board game.???:
HEY, PAL!Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe...Maya:
Happy New Year, Detective!Gumshoe:
Uh... likewise... NOW LISTEN UP, WRIGHT! I WANNA...Maya:
Here's to another fruitful year of lawyer-police cooperation!Gumshoe:
Um... Yeah... Me too... ALRIGHT, PAL! YOU'VE GOT SOME EXPLAINING TO...Maya:
Have you got a holiday present for me, Detective?Gumshoe:
A what? Well... I, um... Here, have this. It-It's really nothing much, but...Maya:
Yay! Thanks!Gumshoe:
LOOK, PAL, WE NEED TO HAVE A TALK. TAKE A SEAT!Maya:
Hey! What about Pearly? You haven't forgotten her present, have you?Gumshoe:
Ah... N-No... I mean, yes... I mean, no... Are you doing this on purpose?Maya:
Ha ha, guess I'm busted. How did you like my first practical joke of the year?Gumshoe:
Very funny, pal. Now let's see how funny you think it is when I show you this!Phoenix:
What is it? A magazine?Maya:
Hey, I wanna see! "Deadly Poisoning Brings Guilty Verdict. Defense Attorney Wright Trounced."Phoenix:
Tr-Trounced!? Let me see that! "The defense attorney gave an almost childishly amateur performance yesterday..." What the heck is this!?Gumshoe:
It's a report, pal. About you!Maya:
Listen to this! "Mr. Wright must take full responsibility for the ruling in this case."Gumshoe:
WELL!? And don't tell me you don't remember anything about it!Phoenix:
But I don't remember anything about it! When was that issue from anyway?Gumshoe:
Umm... December of last year, which I guess makes it last month.Maya:
Which makes it old news, you mean.Phoenix:
But I wasn't involved in a poisoning case in December!Maya:
Hmm, so what do you think this is all about, Nick?Gumshoe:
If it wasn't you, pal, then that leaves only one possibility...Maya:
No way. You don't mean...Phoenix:
A pho...Maya:
A phony Nick!?Phoenix:
(This must be Gumshoe's idea of a joke. Guess he's starting off the year with one, too...)Magazine Clipping added to the Court Record.Gumshoe:
SO!? What are you gonna do about it, pal!?Phoenix:
What do you mean, what am I going to do about it?Maya:
Well, it's your fault that the judge found the defendant guilty in this case!Phoenix:
My fault!? How do you figure that?Maya:
Because THE Phoenix Wright is super famous now! Well, maybe only sort of...Gumshoe:
Yeah. See what happens when you hotshots start getting too full of yourselves?Phoenix:
(But I didn't do anything wrong! ...At least, not that I can remember...)Gumshoe:
You better make this right, pal. Now! And that means taking the case back to court. Got it?Maya:
Sounds like we've got our first case of the new year! Let's tackle it with gusto!Phoenix:
I don't know... The judge already issued a guilty verdict once in this case. It's not going to be easy to get it overturned.Maya:
... I guess that New Year's resolution is going to have to wait until next year.Gumshoe:
So you're taking the case, right!? Good! I'm gonna head over to the courthouse then. After that, I'll go back to the precinct. Drop by if you need something, OK pal!?Phoenix:
(I guess people are starting to know the name "Phoenix Wright". If a client entrusted a case to me based on my reputation... I guess I am kind of responsible. But why would someone want to impersonate me? What sort of a guy would do that?)Examine









Bookshelf







Phoenix:
Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. ...Actually, I've neglected them for so long that they're covered in a layer of dust. I guess I should at least pretend to read them once in a while.




Charley the plant







Phoenix:
Charley. A quite decorative plant. He's sort of a keepsake... something to remember Mia by. Sure, the office is a mess, but I never forget to water this little fella.




Desk







Phoenix:
It's my desk. I don't get to use it much, so it's still super neat and tidy from when Pearls cleaned it.




Movie poster







Phoenix:
An old movie poster. Apparently, this was the first movie that made Mia cry when she saw it, a long time ago. Maya watched it recently, and said she cried all night, too! ...Which, I guess, is why it's back up on the wall. I have to check it out one of these days.




Window







Phoenix:
There is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. The chain is getting so rich that they bought a whole chunk of the next town over... ...and started building a huge theme park. It's going to be called "Gatewater Land". ...I wonder if that bellboy is going to send me a greeting card this year, too?Talk









What to do







Maya:
So, what's our first move?
Phoenix:
I guess we go down to the detention center and talk--
Maya:
Wait a sec, Nick. This person's behind bars because of you. Whoever it is isn't going to be jumping at the chance to meet you, right?
Phoenix:
Hey, hey! Let's get one thing straight. It wasn't me, it was a fake me that did this!
Maya:
Hmm, I wonder if he looks exactly like you... Your phony, Xin Eohp, I mean.
Phoenix:
(I hope not. *shudder* ...And what kind of name for an evil double is Xin Eohp anyway!?)
Maya:
Ah! Nick! I've got it!
Phoenix:
If you're going to ask whether I've got a twin brother, the answer is no.
Maya:
...Spoilsport.




Any ideas







Maya:
Did you notice Gumshoe was acting weirder than usual, or was it just me?
Phoenix:
What do you mean?
Maya:
I mean, he was really worked up. Like a guy who's just found out he's going to be a dad or something.
Phoenix:
Yeah, I guess he was acting kind of strange.
Maya:
Maybe he realized he's got strong feelings for you, Nick!
Phoenix:
... Considering how we interact, I seriously doubt that, Maya...
Maya:
Well, if he wasn't nervous because of you...
Phoenix:
...then maybe it's because of our new guilty client?Present









Attorney's Badge







Maya:
So you've still got that badge, I see.
Phoenix:
Huh!? Well, I'm a lawyer, aren't I?
Maya:
Yeah, but I guess I just didn't think you'd keep on being one for this long. You have to admit, you've had some close brushes with death because of your job.
Phoenix:
(...I fail to see how being a lawyer is more dangerous than channeling dead people.)




Magazine Clipping







Maya:
I can't believe you've got an impersonator.
Phoenix:
I can't either. *sigh*
Maya:
Aww, but look on the bright side. Only famous stars have people impersonating them!
Phoenix:
This isn't funny, Maya. It's not just an impersonation. This guy stole my identity! And someone may have been wrongly convicted as a result.
Maya:
...Guess you should've gone into showbiz, huh, Nick?
Phoenix:
(...*sigh* I will never understand how your mind works, Maya.)




Maya Fey profile







Phoenix:
So? How's your spirit medium training going?
Maya:
Well... I stand under the rushing waters of the shower head every day.
Phoenix:
...That's called "taking a shower". What happened to the rushing waters of a waterfall?
Maya:
Well, I'm kind of taking a break... I'm having a bit of trouble right now, you know?
Phoenix:
(Last year's incident must still be on her mind... I haven't seen Maya train at all since that time. I think Mia said it's because Maya's at a loss these days...)




Mia Fey profile







Phoenix:
Mia helped me out in court again last time.
Maya:
It's so cool that you get to meet my sis like that.
Phoenix:
Yeah...
Maya:
We mediums lose consciousness when we're channeling, so I don't get to see my sis...
Phoenix:
...I never really thought about it that way. Hey! If you want to meet Mia... ...why don't we just have Pearls call her?
Maya:
No... I couldn't do that. I'd be too worried about her.
Phoenix:
(I guess Maya's got all sorts of things to think about, too. ...Despite her immaturity saying otherwise.)




Godot profile







Maya:
So you still can't remember anything about Godot, huh?
Phoenix:
I already told you. I have no idea who he is, let alone why he dislikes me so much.
Maya:
Well he sure seems to have a problem with you for some reason. You'd better watch your back, Nick. Coffee lovers can be quite bitter.
Phoenix:
You're just making that up, Maya!




Dick Gumshoe profile







Maya:
Digging up an old case that's already been ruled on... That's not like Gumshoe, is it?
Phoenix:
No. He barely manages to stay on top of the cases in front of him.
Maya:
Yeah, he's always busy, and gets dirt pay. I mean, look at that dusty old coat he wears!
Phoenix:
(Did you mean he "gets paid dirt" or do you really think they pay him in gravel?)




Any other evidence







Phoenix:
Do you know anything about this, Maya?
Maya:
Hmm... Even someone as worldly-wise as me doesn't know everything about everything, Nick. So I, the great Maya, am sad to say I can't tell you much about this object.

No, he's been out there somewhere. My bet is on the courthouse. He's probably trying to arrange the retrial of this case.Maya:
Guess that means we should go to the detention center and chat with our killer, huh?Phoenix:

Detective on left







Phoenix:
That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself.
Detective:
"Don't die running a red light. Die the old-fashioned way -- of old age!" We have a winner! Inject a bit of humor, that's the key.
Phoenix:
... He must be coming up with slogans for a safety campaign. ...I guess?




Desks







Phoenix:
These are the detectives' desks. There are computers and files on each one. Funny, they're a lot tidier than I expected. I guess the detectives don't spend a lot of time at their desks.




Poster







Phoenix:
A poster of a female police officer... Wait, no. That's the latest "Babes in Uniform" calendar. My bad.




Chief







Phoenix:
This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen.
Chief:
WHAT! Mask☆DeMasque turned up at the bank? What's he doing!? "Hands up, you scalawags!" "You're under arrest!" Hey! That's our job!

Badgers







Maya:
Hey, that's the police mascot, isn't it? It's so cute!
Chief:
That's the "Blue Badger". It was my idea! I made it! And now, it's the national symbol of the police force!
Phoenix:
So what's with the pink one? It's new, right?
Maya:
She's not an "it", Nick. She's a "she", right Chief?
Chief:
Yup. Meet the "Pink Badger".
Maya:
So one's called "Blue", and the other's called "Pink", but they're both called "Badger"?
Chief:
You got it! They're both married.
Maya:
Umm... Mr. & Mrs. Badger seem to be cuffed together, Chief.

Maggey Byrde







Maya:
So, how come you're dressed like that, Maggey? Last year you looked so sharp in that police uniform.
Byrde:
Hmph. I was fired after that... incident last year.
Maya:
Oh. I'm sorry.
Byrde:
It's OK. I don't mind one bit. I enjoyed being on the force, but I think it was time for me to move on.
Maya:
So, what do you do now?
Byrde:
In the second act of "The Life of Maggey Byrde", I'm playing the role of a waitress!
Maya:
A waitress!?
Byrde:
Yes. In a French restaurant. It's a small place, but it's quite fashionable. My charming smile and shapely figure came through for me. And the owner, Mr. Armstrong, hired me straight away, sir.
Phoenix:
And then you got into this mess straight away, right?
Byrde:
Yeah, you could put it that way...




What happened







Byrde:
This whole mess started on the 3rd of last month... And it happened at Trés Bien.
Maya:
"Treh Bee-an"...?
Byrde:
Yes. It's a restaurant where good service and a friendly smile are always included!
Maya:
Oh...
Byrde:
There were two men at the table, both drinking coffee. And then... One of the men slipped some poison into the victim's cup! The victim took just one sip and was gasping for air! I was so shocked, I passed out.
Maya:
Hey, hold on there, Maggey.
Byrde:
What?
Maya:
You keep calling the guy, "the victim". Didn't you know the guy who was killed?
Byrde:
Not at all! I'd never even seen the guy before!
Maya:
Oh...
Phoenix:
(So she wouldn't have a motive to kill him then, I guess...) And the other man, the killer. You saw him, right?
Byrde:
Of course! A good waitress must be attentive to the clientele.
Phoenix:
So, you saw the killer, but you were found guilty of the crime anyway? How come?
Byrde:
......... You tell me, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Ack! (Guess the answer to my question is "my phony"... Anyway, she saw the killer. Better see if I can get a description of the guy.)




Guilty verdict (appears after "What happened")







Maya:
So, if you saw the murderer, why were you still convicted?
Byrde:
Because no one else saw.
Maya:
Saw what?
Byrde:
The other man. The one who put the poison in the victim's coffee. Everyone testified that way. Mr. Armstrong, the customer... Everyone. "The victim was sitting alone at his table the whole time."
Phoenix:
But how's that possible?
Byrde:
I don't know. But nobody, not one person, would believe me, sir. Even Phoenix Wright, my one last hope for a fair trial, failed me. What a pathetic defense! My granny could've done a better job!
Phoenix:
Look! That wasn't me, OK?
Byrde:
And then! ...They found something a bit incriminating in my apron pocket.
Maya:
What?
Byrde:
A small bottle... of poison.
Maya:
WHAT!? P-Poison!? It was in your pocket!?
Byrde:
Well, I passed out when the victim collapsed. The killer must've slipped the poison into my pocket when I was unconscious.
Phoenix:
And no one else saw this other guy?
Byrde:
No, sir. That's what everyone said. But I don't see how they could've missed him...




The other guy (appears after "Guilty verdict")







Byrde:
I was the one who took the coffee to the two men.
Phoenix:
O-Oh...? And what was your impression of them?
Byrde:
Well... When I first saw them, I kind of thought they might be in the music industry.
Maya:
In music? How come?
Byrde:
Well, one of them had some sort of earpiece, and an emo musician's look about him. And there was a sample CD on the table, sir.
Maya:
An earpiece and a sample CD, huh? Did you get a look at the CD at all?
Byrde:
It had a band's name written on it. I think it was "MC"-something. They must've been preparing for their debut, I guess.
Phoenix:
So it was a band's CD. Maybe a promo disc?
Maya:
Maybe it was "MC Screwdriver"!
Phoenix:
Get serious, Maya. Would you buy the CD of a group named that?
Byrde:
Nngh... What was the name of that group again...? "MC Hacksaw..."? No... "MC..."
Maya:
And what about the killer? What did he look like?
Byrde:
Well, I, um... I don't really remember. Only that he was a young man. Well-built like the victim, really.Present

Of course it's real!

Phoenix:
Ah...!

Maya:
She... She bit into it...
Byrde:

Phoenix:
Oh, yeah. I need to ask you about this...
Byrde:
Hey! This article's about my case!
Phoenix:
Can you tell me anything about the guy who was pretending to be me?
Byrde:
Yes, sir! It was the morning after I'd been arrested... I met you in the visitor's room here. You were wearing one of your super-sharp suits.
Phoenix:
Me?
Byrde:
Yes, you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:

Hey, Maggey! Was my evil double Ayam here, too?
Byrde:
No. I don't remember a phony you, Maya.
Maya:

Byrde:
Then you got really worked up and passionate. "I'm gonna get you' cleared'a dis crime!" you said. (Changed from ['I'm gonna get you cleared of this crime!' you said.] in the original release)
Phoenix:
OK, I get the picture. But you've met me in person before... So how come you didn't realize that guy wasn't the real me?
Byrde:
... I guess, looking back now, it was a little strange...
Phoenix:
Only a little?
Byrde:
Well, OK, so you were a bit taller than normal. And you looked a bit shady. And your voice was a bit weird. Oh, and you had this funny accent. And...
Phoenix:
So the guy was nothing like me, then!?
Byrde:
But he had your spiky hair and blue suit.
Phoenix:
(... Is that all it takes for someone to imitate me...?)
Maya:
How about everyone else in the courtroom, like the judge and the observers...? Didn't they realize he was an imposter?
Byrde:
Everyone had these big question marks on their faces... But it seemed that no one wanted to say anything, sir.
Maya:
This case just keeps getting weirder and weirder...

Byrde:
Oh, Detective Gumshoe! He really looked out for me when I was on the force!
Phoenix:
Have you seen him recently?
Byrde:
No. He's never been to the restaurant.
Maya:
Guess he's not a fan of French cuisine, huh? He's an instant noodle type of guy, after all.
Byrde:
Yeah, he prefers the simple things in life.

Cash register







Maya:
Look, it's one of those magical boxes that spits out money.
Phoenix:
You know, you're the only person who would ever describe a cash register in that way!




Trinkets







Maya:
Look at all the little trinkets tucked away in here.
Phoenix:
I bet Mr. Armstrong collected all of these personally. Let's see... A bouquet of flowers, some potpourri, and look! Fine bone china cups!
Maya:
... I never knew you were so... cultured.
Phoenix:
Come on, Maya! This is common knowledge! Any Joe Schmoe knows this much!




Front entrance







Phoenix:
It's the restaurant's front entrance. There's a sign hanging on the door written in French. It probably says, "Open" or "Closed". It must be one or the other, but I don't know which since I dunno Jacques about French.




Magazine rack







Maya:
It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French.
Phoenix:
Why don't you try wearing something a bit more "chic" something, huh, Maya?
Maya:
Yeah. I guess I could. I'm always in my acolyte clothes, aren't I? It'd be fun to wear normal clothes every now and then.
Phoenix:
Hm? There's something stuffed in behind the rack.
Maya:
...Looks like a sports paper to me. Hey, and look at this! Someone's scribbled a little doodle on one of the pages. "MC Bomber", and one, two, three, four, five zeros... A-A hundred thousand... dollars... maybe?
Phoenix:
I wonder what "MC Bomber" is supposed to be...? ! (This paper! It's from December 3rd...) This paper's from the day of the poisoning!
Maya:
WHAT!?
Sports Paper added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(A paper from the day of the murder... This has got to be a clue! I should see if I can find out some more about this paper...)




Magazine rack (subsequent times)







Maya:
It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French.
Phoenix:
Looks like Mr. Armstrong doesn't get any newspapers.
Maya:
Well, it wouldn't exactly suit the feel of the place, would it?
Phoenix:
Why don't you try wearing something a bit more "chic" like in these mags, Maya?
Maya:
Yeah. I'd look stunning in some of those Parisian frocks, huh?
Phoenix:
(We found that sports paper behind this magazine rack earlier... I'd better try to find out everything I can about it...)




Table







Phoenix:
This table's set nicely. It just needs a customer.
Maya:
What do you think this flower is, Nick?
Phoenix:
Let's see... Well, it doesn't look like a tulip, and it's not a sunflower, I don't think...
Maya:
Duh. Even I could've told you that.
Phoenix:
Well, those are the only kinds of flowers I know. Dagnabit, I'm a lawyer, not a botanist!

Phoenix:
Wow! It's a beautiful winter wonderland out there.
Maya:
Really!? Cool! I love snow! Let me see! Huh? It's not white. It's not even snowing.
Phoenix:
Got you! I was only kidding, Maya.
Maya:
Nick! There are lies that are OK to tell, and lies that definitely aren't.
Phoenix:

This restaurant has partitions that separate the tables. When you're seated at a table, you can only see the tables to your right or left.

I guess so, with all this police tape all around it.
Phoenix:
And that stain must be from the poisoned coffee. Don't go licking the tablecloth, OK, Maya?
Maya:
Why would I lick it? I'm not a cat, you know!

Sports Paper







Maya:
Hmm... "MC Bomber"...
Phoenix:
And don't forget the "100,000", too.
Maya:
There's something about that name, "MC Bomber".
Phoenix:
Yeah, It's a pretty unusual name.
Phoenix:
And don't forget the "100,000", too.
Maya:
Everyone's worried about bombs these days, I guess.
Phoenix:
I'm not sure that has any bearing on anything related to this case...)
Maya:
Anyway, we should really look into this some more!




Maggey Byrde profile







Maya:
This is Maggey's second time as a murder suspect, huh?
Phoenix:
Yeah. The first time was a little over a year ago... She was on the police force back then.
Maya:
Wasn't she working under Gumshoe? That does it, Nick! We're gonna get her off the hook or I'll give up hamburgers!Detention CenterPresent









Sports Paper







Byrde:
Oh! A sports paper. Let's see, let's see... Did Gutsen Brawn manage to defend his heavyweight title?
Phoenix:
Sorry, Maggey. That paper is actually a month old... It's from the day of the murder...
Maya:
And Gutsen got knocked out yesterday, I'm afraid.
Byrde:
Oh, no...
Phoenix:
I found this paper in the magazine rack at Trés Bien.
Byrde:
Really? That's strange... Trés Bien doesn't get newspapers. Mr. Armstrong says he's not really fond of them.
Maya:
Then maybe one of the customers left it behind?
Phoenix:
Anyway, what I want you to take a look at is this scribble here.
Byrde:
Ah-ha! That's it, sir! "MC Bomber"! That was the name that was written on the CD!
Phoenix:
(Just as I thought...)
Maya:
I guess it wasn't "MC Screwdriver" after all, huh...
Byrde:
So, that $100,000 must be a down payment for a record deal, right?
Maya:
If someone gave me $100,000, I'd sing for sure! "The Master of Kurain" or "The Spirit Song" or even "Maya's Theme"!
Phoenix:
Um, OK, Maya... So, if the sample CD was on the victim's table... That means this newspaper may have belonged to the victim!
Maya:
You're right!
Phoenix:
(So the victim left this behind on the day of the murder, huh...)
Maya:
I think we better step up the investigation, don't you Nick?After presenting Sports Paper in Detention Center - Visitor's Room:January 6Trés Bien???:

Trés Bien







Maya:
So what does "Trés Bien" mean? I know "trés". That means "three", right?
Armstrong:
Non, non, non! "Trés Bien" is Français! In English, you would say, "Very Good".
Maya:
Oh. Very good...
Armstrong:
Oui, exactement! La atmosphere is trés bien, and la cuisine is trés bien!
Phoenix:
(If the food's good, why aren't there any customers in here?)
Armstrong:
My cuisine is not for all. Some people, z'ey do not appreciate la haute cuisine.
Phoenix:
(I thought everyone liked hot cuisine...)
Armstrong:
Since I 'ave lost Maggey, I do not 'ave enough 'ands.
Phoenix:
So, you're running this place on your own now?
Armstrong:
Oui. For la moment. No one 'as answered my advertisement. Oh, poor moi!
Phoenix:
(... Please don't eyeball me while you say that.)
Armstrong:
I am la chef. I am la manager. I am also a trained aromatherapist.
Maya:
A roaming what?
Armstrong:
A practitioner d'aromatherapy. La art of soothing la soul wiz z'e delicate floral aromas.
Phoenix:
(Delicate? The smell coming from that bottle earlier was anything but...)




What happened







Phoenix:
So, could you tell me what you know about the incident?
Armstrong:
Bien. It makes me sad to remember it, yet I remember it so well. More z'an a month 'as passed since it 'appened.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, I guess it's been about a month since Maggey's sentencing...)
Armstrong:
So. It was z'e third of last month. Just after one in z'e afternoon. A man who was in 'ere for a coffee suddenly became ill.
Phoenix:
Because of the poison in his coffee?
Armstrong:
Z'at is la truth as I know it. It was Maggey who took 'is drink to 'im. I was in la kitchen. I 'eard z'e sound of someone collapsing. When I came out to see what it was, 'e was already slumped in 'is chair.
Maya:
He was dead?
Armstrong:
Mon dieu! Oui! 'E was dead! Maggey 'ad passed out also.
Phoenix:
And this man who died... Was he alone?
Armstrong:
Oui, monsieur. All alone. I know z'at Maggey said z'ere was someone else, but...
Maya:
I see...
Armstrong:
La police, z'ey asked me many times. "Are you sure z'ere was no one else at z'e table?" z'ey asked. But I am not z'e only one. La old man said z'e same thing.
Phoenix:
Old man? What old man?




Old man (appears after "What happened")







Phoenix:
Um... So who is the old man that you mentioned?
Armstrong:
At z'e time of la murder, z'ere was another customer in 'ere.
Maya:
What!? Someone else saw it?
Armstrong:
Mais, oui! As usual, 'e came alone z'at day. At z'e time of la murder, 'e was 'ere. 'E saw it, too. But 'e said z'e same thing, z'at z'ere was no one else at la victim's table.
Maya:
But Maggey swears there were two people!
Armstrong:
Mais, mademoiselle. La lawyer, 'e could not prove z'is, non?
Phoenix:
About the lawyer. That was me, I suppose?
Armstrong:
Mais bien sûr!
Phoenix:
... Wow! He's the first person who's said it wasn't me.
Maya:
Don't kid yourself, Nick! Hmph. Now who's the one making stuff up!?




Maggey's motive (appears after presenting Maggey Byrde profile)







Phoenix:
When Maggey took the coffee over to the victim... ...did anything happen?
Armstrong:
Ou... Oui. I-I suppose you could say so.
Phoenix:
So what happened?
Armstrong:
Non. It was, er... It was nothing.
Maya:
Look, Maggey says she didn't even know the guy! But she's still been indicted for murder! The prosecution must have come up with some kind of motive!
Armstrong:
Oui. It is true.
Phoenix:
If there was anything at all between Maggey and the victim, it could be relevant.
Maya:
So please! Tell us anything you know.

3 PSYCHE-LOCKS

Phoenix:
(Psyche-Locks!?) (Changed from [A Psyche-Lock!?] in the original release)
Maya:
No way! What are we going to do, Nick?
Phoenix:
We'll just have to remov... WHAT THE!?
Maya:
Wh-What's wrong?
Phoenix:
The Magatama... It's gone!
Maya:
Huh?
Phoenix:
I had it in my pocket, but... It has vanished into thin air!
Maya:
WHAT!?
Phoenix:
(But I could see the Psyche-Locks. (Changed from [But I could see the Psyche-Lock.] in the original release) Maybe that means the Magatama's nearby...?)




Maggey's motive (subsequent times)







Phoenix:
Maggey wouldn't just have put poison in the coffee of some guy she didn't even know. If she's really guilty, there must have been something between her and the victim.

3 PSYCHE LOCKS

Armstrong:
N-Non. It was nothing. I am sure. Qué será, será. Perhaps Maggey 'ad another reason.
Phoenix:
(What's Maggey's motive got to do with this chef? Why is he hiding things from me? And another thing... Where did I drop the Magatama? The fact that I can see the lock [sic] must mean it's nearby.)
Maya:
I only loaned it to you, you know. So you better find it, Nick! OK?
Phoenix:
(...And here I thought it was mine to keep!)Present









Attorney's Badge







Armstrong:
Please, monsieur. Z'ere is no need to show me z'at. You are Mon. Phoenix Wright, z'e worst defense lawyer in town.
Phoenix:
(I think I can imagine how he formed this completely wrong impression of me...) Um, the last time we met, did I show you this badge?
Armstrong:
Oui. You flashed it to everyone in la restaurant!
Maya:
Looks like Xin Eohp is a bigger fan of flashing stuff than you are, Nick!




Magazine Clipping







Armstrong:
I am not a lawyer myself. I do not wish to speak out of turn. But your defense in court z'at day was a little, how you say, "lacking", per'aps?
Phoenix:
*sigh*
Armstrong:
Even a Frenchman who cannot speak any English could 'ave done a better job! You were very cool, though. Oh, oui, oui! So 'andsome.
Maya:
Wow, I wonder just how bad the defense could've been...
Armstrong:
Every time you opened your mouth, z'e 'ole courthouse stirred.
Phoenix:
(Oh, man. That is something I don't want to imagine...)




Sports Paper







Phoenix:
We found this sports paper in the magazine rack here.
Armstrong:
One of my customers must 'ave left it behind.
Maya:
Do you have any idea which customer it was?
Armstrong:
Z'e only ideas I 'ave, mademoiselle, I save for my kitchen!

Maggey Byrde profile







Armstrong:
Maggey was a policewoman once, n'est-ce pas?
Phoenix:
Yes. But she had to quit for, um, reasons beyond her control.
Armstrong:
Oui, oui. She was la suspect in la murder investigation, non?
Maya:
Oh... You know about that?
Armstrong:
Z'at is why I gave to 'er la perfume for la 'appiness.
Phoenix:
Happiness perfume?
Armstrong:
Oui. Blended from bergamot, like I 'ave given to you before.
Phoenix:
But she's been arrested again. And found guilty this time.
Armstrong:
Z'is is true. 'Er natural aroma of un'appiness must 'ave been very strong.
Phoenix:
(Just admit it! Your perfume doesn't work!)
Armstrong:
I am not surprised she was la prime suspect. After something like z'at took place before my very eyes.
Maya:
Something like what?
Phoenix:
(What's this guy talking about!?)
Maya:
Does this mean... Maggey did have a motive?
Phoenix:
We've got to ask this guy for more info, stat!




Jean Armstrong profile







Armstrong:
It is 'ard to imagine, I know, but I was an apprentice for five years in la gay Paris.
Maya:
Wow! In Paris!?
Armstrong:
It was something la chef z'ere said to me z'at made me decide to open my own restaurant.
Phoenix:
What was it?
Armstrong:
Z'at awful man said to me, "You must train for another ten years!" Oh! It was such a shock! So unexpected! But you would 'ave to be a fool to do z'is, non?

Sandbox







Maya:
I used to love sandboxes like you wouldn't believe!
Phoenix:
Really? You?
Maya:
Sure. Finding iron filings in the sand with a magnet was my favorite thing to do.
Phoenix:
Iron filings? Wow... That's too exciting for words.
Maya:
It was my ambition to collect every single shred of iron in the sandbox. I was such a kid back then!
Phoenix:
So, did you manage to get all the iron?
Maya:
No, I never did. I think I came close, though. Come to think of it, I still have all the iron filings I found way back when. You want them?
Phoenix:
No.




Fruit attractions







Maya:
This place is so fruity!
Phoenix:
That's not a bad thing. Besides, I love apples. They're among my favorites.
Maya:
Then that apple slide is perfect for you!
Phoenix:
... And what is so "perfect" about it?
Maya:
Oh come on. Don't be a stick in the mud! Slide down it a few times. Go on! Woo!
Phoenix:
No way! I'd get covered in sand if I slid down that slide. Anyone can see that.
Maya:
Yeah, you're right. Otherwise, I'd give it a try, too.




Pigeons







Maya:
Hey, look. Pigeons!
Phoenix:
Yeah. And heaps of them, too.
Maya:
Did you know that pigeons are a symbol of peace?
Phoenix:
That's a dove, not a pigeon.
Maya:
... Poor things. Just because they're gray means they can't be symbols of peace and harmony?
Phoenix:
You're over-thinking this one by just a smidge, Maya.




Magazine on orange-themed seat







Maya:
Ooh, there's a magazine here.
Phoenix:
It's a magazine full of job listings.
Old Man:
You disgusting rogue, picking up something someone else threw away!
Phoenix:
"Threw away"? Did you throw this away? Are you looking for a job?
Old Man:
Kah! That's none of your business!
Phoenix:
Sorry! I guess I'll take the magazine with me then.
Old Man:
I don't want anyone else having it! Give it back!

A disgrace?
Old Man:
An innocent young girl revealing herself like that!
Phoenix:
Revealing!? You mean her uniform?
Old Man:

Maya:
What about me? I'm not wearing anything revealing.
Old Man:
You!? Your problem is you lack any sense of grace!

Phoenix:
So one's called "Blue", and the other's called "Pink", but they're both called "Badger"?
Chief:
You got it! They're married.
Phoenix:
(So should I expect to see Baby Badger next time I'm here...?)Talk









Maggey Byrde







Phoenix:
So the guilty party was Maggey Byrde, huh?
Gumshoe:
Yeah...
Phoenix:
Back when she was on the police force... ...you were her mentor when she was a rookie, right?
Gumshoe:
Yeah, I kept a close eye on her. I-I mean, not too close. You know.
Phoenix:
...
Gumshoe:
...... ......... Hey, what's with the funny looks, pal? I was with her... It wasn't anything like... Look! Sure, I was her boss when she was doing her training. But that was it. Nothing happened.
Phoenix:
(Gumshoe sure is sweating up a storm over nothing... ...Ah, so that's it! Our big ol' Gumshoe has a little ol' crush on Maggey!)
Gumshoe:
I... I don't like her or anything! I... I was... Aaaargh!
Phoenix:
(Note to self: Gossip with Maya about this later!)
Gumshoe:
Look, pal! Don't tell anyone, OK!? You've gotta keep it a secret, got it!?
Phoenix:
S-Sure... And would you mind not guessing what I'm thinking all the time?
Gumshoe:
Hey, tell your face, pal, not me. You'd have to be blind not to see what's on your mind.




The victim







Phoenix:
So I was wondering... Could you fill me in on the victim?
Gumshoe:
Glen Elg, he was a computer programmer.
Phoenix:
I see. A programmer...
Gumshoe:
He was just a regular Joe working for a small-time computer firm. Maggey never had any contact with the guy before that day. ...And all she did was take him his coffee on the day of the murder, pal.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, Maggey also claimed to have never seen the guy before...) Did the victim go to the restaurant often?
Gumshoe:
Not according to the chef. Said it was the first time he'd seen the guy.
Phoenix:
(A programmer... and a first-time customer at that...) (Changed from [A programmer... and a first-time customer...] in the original release) What possible reason could Maggey have had to kill a guy like that?
Gumshoe:
That's what I thought. But a motive was still somehow established in her trial.
Phoenix:
You're kidding! What was her supposed "motive"?
Gumshoe:
Sorry, pal. I'm real busy. I haven't even got enough time to sift through these papers. Look into it yourself, OK?
Phoenix:
(What could this motive have been...?)




The investigation







Gumshoe:
This isn't really a proper investigation. I'm kind of working on it by myself.
Phoenix:
O-Oh, that's right...
Gumshoe:
The judge already ruled on the case, and all the evidence is in already. The only problem is with Maggey's testimony.
Phoenix:
Yeah... Doesn't sound very good for us, huh?
Gumshoe:
Look, pal. I've got a mountain of papers on this case to look over before tomorrow. So I'm just gonna say this... Maggey Byrde's no liar. She's... She's... OK, so she's a bit out there, and a bit off base sometimes. But she was a good cop.
Phoenix:
(That's not exactly complimentary, you know!) So what do you think really happened? And just how contradictory is her testimony?




Contradictions (appears after "The investigation")







Gumshoe:
The biggest problem with Maggey's testimony is the number of people at the table.
Phoenix:
Yeah. My thoughts exactly. Maggey still insists there was another guy sitting with the victim.
Gumshoe:
Right. But get this... Everyone else in the place says the guy was alone. Even the chef. And then there's that CD...
Phoenix:
(CD? Oh, yeah. She did mention something about a CD...)


Byrde:
And there was a sample CD on the table, sir.


Gumshoe:
But our guys turned that place upside down. There was no CD.
Phoenix:
What?
Gumshoe:
Not on the table. Not anywhere in the whole restaurant, pal.
Phoenix:
But didn't Maggey say the victim was wearing an earpiece, too?
Gumshoe:
Yeah, but that was for the portable radio in the front pocket of his hoodie.
Phoenix:
A radio? He didn't have a CD player?
Gumshoe:
You got it. Your phony never explained that contradiction at all.
Phoenix:
(Come to think of it... The owner of Trés Bien didn't mention that CD either. I don't know why, but I get the feeling Mr. Armstrong's got something to hide...)




The charming chef (appears after presenting Jean Armstrong profile)







Phoenix:
So what exactly is it that caught your attention about the chef at Trés Bien?
Gumshoe:
It's, um... kind of hard to say... The guy's probably not even connected with the case anyway...
Phoenix:
Hey, come on, Detective. Didn't you say you'd give me the dirt on anything?
Gumshoe:
Well, this sort of stuff is kinda... unimportant, gossipy stuff, you know pal? Look, how about this? You go to Trés Bien and investigate the place yourself. And if you find out anything suspicious about the guy... you report back to me, OK?
Phoenix:
Um... Don't suppose I get a choice in this, huh? (Guess I better find out more about the chef and Trés Bien; then report back to Gumshoe.)Present









Attorney's Badge







Gumshoe:
Is that thing real, pal?
Phoenix:
Why does everybody keep asking me that?
Gumshoe:
I wonder what this phony of yours is like...
Phoenix:
He had Maggey found guilty of murder. Doesn't that tell you? (I've got to track this creep down!)




Magazine Clipping







Gumshoe:
I wasn't at the trial myself. But I asked this one detective I know how your defense was.
Phoenix:
And what did he say?
Gumshoe:
He started off by saying, "I'm at a complete loss for words..." But he must have found some quick because he went on about how bad you were for an hour.
Phoenix:
But...
Gumshoe:
He said you sucked so much, it seemed like you were trying to get Maggey found guilty!
Phoenix:
(It looked like I was "trying to get Maggey found guilty"...?)




Sports Paper







Gumshoe:
What's that? A sports paper?
Phoenix:
Yeah. I found it in the magazine rack at Trés Bien.
Gumshoe:
It's dated the same day as the murder. You may be onto something here.
Phoenix:
And take a look at this. See this writing here?
Gumshoe:
"MC Bomber"... Hey!
Phoenix:
What is it?
Gumshoe:
I've heard that name somewhere before. Yeah, "MC Bomber"...
Phoenix:
(Wow, he actually seems to be thinking for once!)
Gumshoe:
Ack, it's no good. I can't remember...
Phoenix:
(...And he goes back to being the Gumshoe we all know and love.)
Gumshoe:
Hey, pal. I'm gonna borrow this paper for a bit, OK? I wanna get a handwriting analysis done on this scribble.
Phoenix:
(Handwriting, huh? It'd be good to know more about that, in any case...)
Gumshoe:
Thanks, pal! I bet this'll turn out to be interesting clue!
Sports Paper given to Detective Gumshoe.




Maya Fey profile







Gumshoe:
Hey! So how come she's not with you today?
Phoenix:
She's working down at the restaurant right now.
Gumshoe:
Working, huh? Yeah, it's tough being broke. I would know.
Phoenix:
Um... OK...?
Gumshoe:
Next time I see her, I'll show her how to make the world's best instant noodles. We low earners have to stick together! It's the only way!
Phoenix:
(Um... Why is he shaking my hand with such enthusiasm...?)




Mia Fey profile







Gumshoe:
She cross-examined me once, you know.
Phoenix:
What? Mia did?
Gumshoe:
Yeah. That was us. The big guns locking horns. Witness versus lawyer! It was a battle of cunning tactics and tricks.
Phoenix:
(But the witness isn't supposed to play any tricks...)
Gumshoe:
I can't believe she's gone...




Godot profile







Gumshoe:
That's the guy who's gonna be the prosecutor in Maggey's retrial tomorrow.
Phoenix:
O-Oh, really?
Gumshoe:
He was working on a bunch of more important cases at the moment... ...but he canceled them all just so he could take you on, pal.
Phoenix:
(Why's that guy so determined to see me fail?)
Gumshoe:
You sure attract a lot of attention, huh? Too bad it's all the wrong kind.




Dick Gumshoe profile







Gumshoe:
I'm such a loser. I had high hopes for Maggey. I was gonna make her the best detective there ever was. But then all the sudden she was charged with murder and arrested. I never saw it coming. I never imagined they'd find her guilty. I hate myself for not being able to do anything.
Phoenix:
It's OK, Detective Gumshoe. We still have a chance to make this right.
Gumshoe:
... You know what? You're not such a bad guy after all, pal.




Maggey Byrde profile







Phoenix:
Have you gone to see Maggey?
Gumshoe:
Of course I have! But I... I wasn't much good at consoling her. I'm... I'm not very good with words.
Phoenix:
Oh...
Gumshoe:
Yeah. I guess I must've looked a bit down. Maggey was really supportive of me. It was great to have someone to talk to.
Phoenix:
(Did he go for her, or for himself...?)




Jean Armstrong profile







Gumshoe:
The chef of Trés Bien, huh? You know what that chef said to me? "Oh là là! Your body is full of la toxins." And then he gave me this bottle.
Phoenix:
What's in it?
Gumshoe:
I don't know. The label says, "Juniper". I'm under orders to put a few drops of it in my bath every day.
Phoenix:
Under orders?
Old Man:
Yeah. You know, there's something about the lady... I mean, guy.
Phoenix:
Huh!? You can't stop thinking about him!?
Gumshoe:
Not like that, pal! Gimme a break! He's not my type. I mean, I can't stop thinking that he's involved with this case somehow!
Phoenix:
(Sounds like he knows a little something more about our charming chef.)




Anything else







Phoenix:
What do you make of this...?
Gumshoe:
Sorry, pal. All I can think about is Maggey at the moment. ... ...... N-No! I didn't mean it like that! I meant...

Waitress







Phoenix:
So, how do you like your new job, Maya?
Maya:
I never knew there was so much for a waitress to do! Take people's orders, bringing them their food, make coffee, work the cash register... Of course, we need a customer before I can do any of that.
Phoenix:
Yeah, it's a nice-looking restaurant. It's a shame more people don't come.
Maya:
Don't forget about the ultra cute waitress! Check out my "gimme a tip" smile!




Lunch special







Maya:
Hey, Nick! Why don't you order something? The chef's preparing a tasty lunch set at the moment. Or so he says.
Phoenix:
How much is it?
Maya:
It's the Twin-T set. So it's 20 dollars, of course.
Phoenix:
The Twin-T set? I believe I'll be taking a pass. It's kind of expensive.
Maya:
What!? But you can't! Come on, Nick! It's not every day I get to be a waitress! I want to try carrying plates and working the cash register!
Phoenix:
How about cleaning the toilets? That should keep you busy.
Maya:
Yeah, right! Maybe later.Present

Kitchen







Phoenix:
Hmm, now what was it that Maggey said again? "In the kitchen, you'll get to see all of the chef's greatest secrets!"
Maya:
In the kitchen? Mmm. That sounds tasty!
Phoenix:
Hey, wait up! Maya!
Maya:
What is it? I'm pretty busy right now.

Mirror







Maya:
Now THIS is one large mirror! I bet this is where he makes himself look pretty.
Phoenix:
There's a book on the dresser. "Claurice Armstrong's Bedtime Literature".
Maya:
Not exactly Pulitzer Prize material, is it?
Phoenix:
It looks like a collection of poems he's written.
Maya:
Poems? Cool! Read one out! And say it in your best French accent... with intensity! OK?
Phoenix:
OK, um... Here's one. Ahem! It's called, "Printemps". "Zee two of zem, like actors from a film. Zee coffee still undrunk. Sweet nothings over too soon, on zat sad Sunday morning. Zee foolish cocktail so delicious. Take zee last sip of your tea and I know what I will do. I must lie to you. I must."
Maya:
Huh? That's it!?
Phoenix:
Yup. That's a poem for you.




Oil bottles







Phoenix:
What's this? It looks like a treasure chest or something.
Maya:
Wow! Look at all these little bottles!
Phoenix:
Oh! They're aromatherapy oils! He's got so many, they're overflowing onto the floor...
Maya:
Let's see... 1, 2, 3... ...98, 99, 100! They're all the same, too. Hey, wait a minute...
Phoenix:
What is it?
Maya:
There's one bottle that's different from all the others.
Phoenix:
Well what do you know. And it doesn't have a label either.
Maya:
And... *sniff* It doesn't smell.
Phoenix:
(So what's that liquid inside then, I wonder?)
Maya:
Hey, Nick, we should borrow this. I mean, look how many bottles he's got. He won't miss one, will he?
Small Bottle added to the Court Record.

Lace curtains







Phoenix:
What are these lace curtains for?
Maya:
I don't know. But they give the place a real homey feel, don't they? Hmm... Lace curtains... You know, if I was a cooking pot, I'd be perfectly happy to sit on a shelf under those.
Phoenix:
(How do you respond to something like that!?)




Table







Maya:
Now I know for sure I'm in a French restaurant. I've never heard of most of these seasonings. Hey, Nick! This container has... oyster sauce? What's that?
Phoenix:
(Isn't that used in Chinese food...?) Ack! Look! Right there on the counter!

Maya:
A cheesecake? You don't exactly need a sharp knife for one of those, Nick.

Maya:
Mmm. That smells good. Something's bubbling away nicely in that pot. It must be the lobster and abalone fricassée with balsamic vinaigrette.

They said the doodle was written by the victim, Glen Elg. No doubt about it.Phoenix:

Armstrong's secret (appears after presenting Small Bottle)







Phoenix:
So what's Mr. Armstrong's secret?
Gumshoe:
You ever had lunch at Trés Bien, pal?
Phoenix:
Um... Yes...
Gumshoe:
So, how was it?
Phoenix:
To put it nicely... it was inedible.
Gumshoe:
Hey, don't worry about being nice around me, pal. You and I both know the reason that place is so empty is because of the food. I mean, the place is clean, and he's got a girl like Maggey as a waitress, so...
Phoenix:
Yeah... I guess it's probably the food.
Gumshoe:
The real scoop on the guy is he's up to his ears in debt.
Phoenix:
Really? How much does he owe?
Gumshoe:
This is a copy of his loan contract. He's about half a million in the red.
Phoenix:
H-Half a million? Are we talking dollars?
Gumshoe:
Yeah. Hey, if it was Sterling, he'd really be in trouble!
Phoenix:
Sorry. That figure just took me by surprise.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, this case is full of surprises. And I'd be willing to bet that chef's got something to do with most of them. That's my hunch.

Sports Paper







Gumshoe:
So according to the boys down at the lab, the doodles were probably made by the victim.
Phoenix:
Probably?
Gumshoe:
Analyzing this kind of writing is difficult since it's done with a fiber-tipped pen. But don't worry! I'll vouch for it.
Phoenix:
(Why would Gumshoe have to vouch for it? Can't it stand on its own?)




Small Bottle







Gumshoe:
You got one of those aroma bottles too, huh?
Phoenix:
Only this one doesn't smell.
Gumshoe:
Huh? I don't get you...
Phoenix:
This was mixed in with all the other aromatherapy bottles, but it's not the same. It doesn't even look the same, wouldn't you agree?
Gumshoe:
A cologne bottle that doesn't smell, huh? Smells like a skunk to me, pal! Mind letting me borrow that bottle for a while? I wanna send it to the lab for analysis.

Gumshoe:
I can't give you an answer on that, pal. Not without the case file in front of me. But I'll tell you this... That Armstrong guy would've done anything for cash. He was desperate, you know?

3 PSYCHE-LOCKS
-- Trés Bien regular --
Phoenix:
It's time you told me the truth. Why are you a regular at a restaurant that you dislike so much?
Old Man:
Isn't it obvious!? People only have one reason to go to restaurants. To eat!
Phoenix:
To eat? Is that the whole truth?
Old Man:
Wh-What do you mean!?
Phoenix:
I don't think you go to that restaurant for the food at all.
Old Man:
You insolent brat! How dare you accuse me! What proof have you got!?
Phoenix:
I can tell that not you nor anyone else in the world would go to that place for its food.

Phoenix:
The proof is in the pudding. Or in this case, the lunch menu.
Old Man:
That's the Twin-T set!
Phoenix:
The food at Trés Bien is terrible. And expensive.
Old Man:
You're wrong. It's cheap.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Old Man:
I'm rich. I inherited money when I was a boy. Yes, I'm stinking rich! I haven't done a jot of work since I was born. Other than feeding the pigeons.
Phoenix:
(What a load of crock!)
Old Man:
The taste's another story, but the price... It's nothing to me.
Phoenix:
So, you're saying that you go there because you've got money to burn?
Old Man:
Exactly! I have so much cash, I go for a swim in my money vault every day!
Phoenix:
Unfortunately, that's a lie.
Old Man:
What!?

You don't have money to burn. You're flat broke!

Yeah... I think you mean a cappuccino. Anyway, how much does a cappuccino cost there?
Old Man:
Eight dollars.
Phoenix:
(Those had better be some golden beans!)
Old Man:
What's your problem? You think a poor man would be better off drinking dishwater, do you? Is that it!?
Phoenix:
N-No. I wasn't thinking that. I was wondering if the coffee there is really that great... 
Old Man:
No, it's not. But... But anyway! Yes! That place has free newspapers to read every day.
Phoenix:
Newspapers?
Old Man:
Exactly. They don't want me hanging around at home, so I go there.

And you are probably telling the truth here. Because you weren't looking at the girl's face... But at her outfit!
Old Man:

That's the truth, isn't it? You became a regular at the restaurant because of the waitress's uniform! That uniform is all you can think about, isn't it?

It was quite a shock! Even for me. He was a strange-looking boy. The girl took the javaccino over to him, you see.
Mia:
And... was the customer alone?
Kudo:
Definitely! He was the only person at the table. Then he took one sip of his javaccino, and...
Mia:
And?
Kudo:
And he said something like, "Uaaaargh!" and then collapsed. Dead.

Oh, how terrifying!

(I can only wish...)January 7, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Maggey Byrde.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.Godot:
... Aaah, bitter!Judge:
Mr... Um... Mr. Wright.Phoenix:
Y-Yes, Your Honor?Judge:
Aaaah!Phoenix:
Wh-What's wrong!?Judge:
Nothing. It's just whenever I addressed you in the previous trial, your response was... "Youse talkin' to me!?" It was a little, well... intimidating.Phoenix:
No, no! That wasn't me. That was the phony Phoenix.Judge:
I see. So our trusty Phoenix Wright is back with us now, is he?Phoenix:
("Our trusty"...?)Judge:
So, Mr. Godot. Your opening statement, please.Godot:
Mr. Trite... Whether you're a fake or the real deal... We will find out soon enough through this trial today.Phoenix:
But I can already tell you! I'm the real Phoenix Wright!Godot:
I wasn't questioning whether you are Phoenix Wright or not. I was questioning whether you had studied law or not. That's what I intend to find out.Phoenix:
(There's no denying it. Behind that mask is a man who really hates me for some reason or another!)Judge:
As everyone is aware, the court has already given its verdict on this case once. Therefore, I won't stand for irrelevant testimony during this retrial. Nor will I stand for a simple repetition of the evidence presented in the last trial.Phoenix:
(I'm not planning on repeating anything that phony me said! Trust me!)Judge:
Now then. Mr. Godot, please summon your first witness.Godot:
Let's start with the formalities, shall we? Name and occupation?Gumshoe:
...Judge:
Witness! State your name for the court!Gumshoe:
Huh? Oh, sorry, sir! The name's Police Department Detective. Occupation, Dick Gumshoe.Godot:
Other way around, Detective.Gumshoe:
Huh? Oh! Sorry. Anyway, I'm the officer in charge of this case since yesterday. Sir!Judge:
Since yesterday?Gumshoe:
Yeah. The guy who was on the initial investigation's tied up with another case now.Maya:
I hope Gumshoe's really got everything under control... For everyone's sake.Judge:
I see. So, Detective Gumshoe... Would you outline for the court the basic facts of the case?Gumshoe:
Y-Y-Yes, sir. The victim's name was Glen Elg. He was a professional programmer. He was on the payroll of Blue Screens Inc., a local company. This is the victim's autopsy report.Judge:
The court accepts this into evidence.Glen's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.Gumshoe:
Um... And here are the floor plans of the restaurant. When the incident took place, the victim was sitting right here. The poisoned coffee was brought over to him by the, um... By the waitress.Judge:
The waitress being the accused?Gumshoe:
Yeah... The victim died from poisoning almost immediately after he took a sip of the coffee. At the time of the incident, there were two other people in the restaurant. Mr. Jean Armstrong, the owner and chef. And a regular by the name of Mr. Victor Kudo.Judge:
Hmm... It still seems to be a very straightforward case to me.Trés Bien Floor Plans added to the Court Record.Godot:
Come, Detective. Take up this hammer. And nail the defendant's coffin shut with your own two hands.Judge:
Now then, Detective Gumshoe. Let's have your testimony.Gumshoe:
Umm... Yes, sir...Witness Testimony-- The Incident --Gumshoe:
When the incident took place, the victim was alone at his table, sir.
We understand that the guy, Glen Elg, was listening to the radio at the time.
Traces of poison were found in his coffee cup.
And what we found was potassium cyanide. That stuff really packs a punch!
And, um... it looks like Ms. Byrde might've had, well... some kind of a motive.Judge:
Hmm...Godot:
Using the dark, aromatic depths of coffee to conceal the poison... Classy lady!Judge:
The facts of this case seem to be ironclad. Mr. Wright. I would ask you to begin your cross-examination, but...Phoenix:
Yes?Judge:
Please, no intimidation tricks this time around. Is that understood?Phoenix:
I already told you! That wasn't me!Cross Examination-- The Incident --Gumshoe:

Phoenix:
Can I stop you for just a minute?
Gumshoe:
Huh? What is it? Did I say something that contradicts the evidence?
Phoenix:
(He'd so desperate for that to be true, he's practically crying!) Your testimony just now doesn't match the testimony given by Ms. Byrde. She claims that there was another man at the victim's table.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, that's what she said. And I--
Godot:

Godot:
What killer wouldn't say that when faced with a homicide conviction?
Phoenix:
Hey!
Godot:
Sadly, her testimony isn't supported by the owner or the other customer. Isn't that right, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
Yeah, it's true. Their two testimonies tie up on that. They both said there was no other guy at the table.
Judge:
Hmm...
Phoenix:
(What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?)



Leave it







Phoenix:
(No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.)
Maya:
If you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad.
Phoenix:
...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony.

Phoenix:
Well, maybe the other witnesses just missed him! Perhaps their view of the victim's table was obscured in some way.
Godot:
Ha...! That argument is as weak as the coffee at Trés Bien, Trite!
Phoenix:
...!
Godot:
I have here in my possession a ticket.
Phoenix:
A ticket? (Looks more like a photo to me.)
Godot:
Yes. A one-way ticket to guilty-ville! Population: the defendant! This is a photograph taken from near the entrance to the kitchen.
Judge:
This is the scene as witnessed by the chef, moments after the poisoning took place, correct?
Godot:
I think the court will agree that with such a clear view of the scene of the crime... ...how, Mr. Trite, could anyone have overlooked a second person at the table?
Phoenix:
Urk!
Judge:
It certainly seems to show the victim's table extremely clearly.

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So, traces of the poison were found in the coffee cup and nowhere else?
Gumshoe:

Phoenix:
Was the poison a liquid? Or was it a powder?
Gumshoe:
If I had to put it in layman's terms, I'd say it was a powdery substance.
Phoenix:
So the poison could've been in anything that was on the table. Sugar, salt, pepper...
Godot:

Godot:
Ha...! Do you put salt and pepper in your coffee, Trite?
Gumshoe:
The victim took his coffee black, with no sugar.

Phoenix:
Are you absolutely certain that the victim even drank any of his coffee?
Gumshoe:
Huh!? What do you mean?
Phoenix:
According to this file, "the poison was found in the victim's coffee cup." But what proof is there that the victim ever drank any of it!?
Gumshoe:
Oh, hey! You're right! That's what I was think--
Godot:

Godot:
In case you were wondering, that last objection was for the detective there.
Gumshoe:
Huh? For me?
Godot:
"Oh, hey! You're right!"? You may be fooling the court, but I'm not falling for it. If you have the time to waste, you have the time to present that piece of evidence.

Yes. THAT piece.

Godot:
This!

Oh. Now I remember! Um... This is the, uh... victim's coffee cup.
Godot:
Yes, the victim's cup. Take a good look at the rim.
Judge:
Oh, yes. It's unmistakable. There is clearly a coffee stain on it.
Godot:
Conclusive proof that the victim did drink the poisoned coffee that was in this cup. The victim gulped down the bitter death that the waitress brought to him... like this!
Phoenix:
Uuuurgh!
Gumshoe:
For the record, the only prints on the cup were the victim's and the defendant's.

Phoenix:

Phoenix:

Gumshoe:
It's... Well... That stuff's lethal! Eat too much, and you're history.
Maya:
How much is too much?
Godot:
A lethal dose is 0.2 grams. That's about enough to finish anyone off.
Maya:
0.2 grams? How much is that?
Gumshoe:
You know when you swab your ears for earwax? Yeah, about that much.
Phoenix:
(Earwax, huh? Sounds like something Gumshoe's got an abundance of...)

Godot:
I'm saying, we can always get another witness on the stand, if we have to chuck you out.
Gumshoe:

Godot:
So stick to the facts, Detective. Now then, what was Ms. Byrde's motive?
Phoenix:
(Come on, Gumshoe...)
Gumshoe:
She was... They said she wanted to steal a lottery ticket.
Phoenix:
I knew it... (That's what we heard yesterday, too.)
Gumshoe:
It disappeared from the scene of the crime.
Godot:
And it wasn't just any lottery ticket. It was a winning ticket for half a million!

Mr. Armstrong knew about the ticket too, didn't he? But he stole the wrong one...

That's enough! The facts of this case seem overwhelmingly clear to me. The defendant had ample opportunity to commit the crime of which she is charged. Furthermore, it seems beyond reasonable doubt that she did indeed commit this crime.Godot:
I like an old man who knows the score.Judge:
There is also the matter of the half a million dollar lottery ticket. That alone provides a very credible motive. I mean, for that sum of money even I might be tempted to bend the rules!Godot:

Of course. The coffee stain isn't the most interesting thing about this apron. No, there's something else that stands out even more.Judge:

Of course. I'm referring to the pocket.Phoenix:

Don't play games, prosecutor! The blood-colored stain that's smeared all over the apron!Godot:
That's ridiculous! No one told me anything about a bloodstain!Phoenix:

Well, Detective!? Could this stain really be... BLOOD!?Gumshoe:
N-No way, sir! That's... It's just ketchup. Sir.Phoenix:
Ketchup!?Gumshoe:
She must've gotten some on her an apron while taking someone their breakfast that day.Judge:

Pull a stunt like that again, and I'll have you drink 17 cups of ketchup, witness!Gumshoe:
Unnngh... I thought everyone knew what it was already.Judge:
Hmm... I haven't seen anything yet to make me doubt the last verdict I ruled on this case.Phoenix:

Well, Trite... It seems you really are a phony after all.Phoenix:

Witness, please continue with your testimony. Describe for the court the crime scene and the findings of your investigation there.Witness Testimony-- The Investigation --Gumshoe:
The crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.
Poor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her.
The victim didn't have any identification on him.
But we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly.
When Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison.
And that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene.Judge:
Hmm... You identified the victim and secured your prime suspect... Very good.Godot:
Last chance to convince the court you're a real lawyer, Trite!Phoenix:

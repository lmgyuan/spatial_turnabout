    "response": "To find a contradiction in Edgeworth's testimony, we need to closely examine the statements he made and consider the evidence we have.\n\nLet's go through Edgeworth's testimony step by step:\n\n1. Edgeworth mentions going to the courtroom to observe his father's trials. This sets the initial context and doesn't offer much room for contradiction.\n\n2. He describes being trapped in the elevator during an earthquake. This is consistent with the DL-6 case file, which mentions the incident took place during an earthquake.\n\n3. Edgeworth says that his father and Yogi began to argue. This is corroborated by the intense situation, but lacks specific detail that can be challenged directly.\n\n4. He claims that something heavy fell at his feet, which he then picked up and threw at Yanni Yogi to stop the fighting. This is worth exploring further \u2014 what exactly was this \"heavy\" object? \n\n5. He hears a gunshot and a scream after throwing the object. The significance here is the sequence of events that culminate in a gunshot.\n\nGiven that, let's consider the evidence, specifically focusing on the details of the incident and the context around it:\n\n- The DL-6 Incident Photo shows a bullet hole, and the DL-6 Case File outlines the sequence of events during the earthquake, but a critical point is the weapon: what was it doing there and who could have accessed it?\n\n- \"DL-6 Bullet\" indicates the bullet came from a pistol kept in the evidence. The narrative around the \"heavy object\" is crucial \u2014 it implies that Edgeworth could have thrown something other than a pistol, as his description implies use of a non-lethal argument stopper.\n\n- From this testimony, he doesn't initially link picking up \"something heavy\" to the gun firing. This lack of connection is vital and could establish reasonable doubt regarding his direct involvement in the shooting.\n\nThe piece of evidence most likely to expose a contradiction here involves the circumstances of the DL-6 shooting:\n\n- The \"DL-6 Bullet\" was found in Gregory Edgeworth's heart, implying precise usage of the pistol he assumes to throw.\n\nNow we reveal the contradiction:\n\nEdgeworth describes throwing a heavy object which causes the sound of a gunshot. This assumption inaccurately accounts for his action directly leading to a shooting, as dying testimony requires meticulous ballistics evidence, which places the \"Just then, something heavy fell at my feet\" in dispute.\n\n**Final Contradiction**: If the gun fell at his feet and was thrown and not directly shot with intent, the blame cannot hinge on Miles, given the alternative evidence (ballistics) showing no direct personal enactment of shooting intent.\n\nGiven these details, the contradiction could be:\n\n- On the statement: \"Just then, something heavy fell at my feet.\"\n- Evidence: \"DL-6 Bullet\" and/or \"DL-6 Case File\"\n\nNow let's present it:\n\n**Reasoning**: Guns typically discharge when trigger pulled, not merely moving. Therefore, something heavy causing a gunshot sound immediately after suggesting a lapse.\n\nLet's highlight this inconsistency:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"present\",\n  \"testimony\": 3,\n  \"evidence\": 21\n}\n```",

    "response": "Let's examine the testimony to identify a contradiction. The key points in Acro's testimony are:\n\n1. Acro says he could have lifted something the size of the bust, suggesting that he acknowledges his upper body strength.\n2. He mentions that only his legs were injured, indicating that his upper body is still functional.\n3. He claims it's impossible to lift the bust and look out the window, suggesting a physical limitation.\n4. Acro states that he couldn't exert force with his lower body, which we already know since he's paralyzed.\n5. He argues that it's impossible to have known the location of the Ringmaster's head without looking.\n6. Concludes that it's unrealistic to drop the bust on the Ringmaster without these capabilities.\n\nLooking at the evidence, it's important to consider how Acro could have known the location or created the setup to target the Ringmaster without physically seeing him directly. This indicates he must have some way of knowing the location to make such a claim. \n\nThe contradiction arises in Point 5. If Acro couldn't have known the location of the Ringmaster's head due to his physical limitations, then how did he manage to position the bust correctly?\n\nThe note addressed to \"The Murderer\" and its instructions for someone to meet at the plaza can offer insight into planning or setups that may have given Acro the information he needed about the Ringmaster's location, thus pointing to a plan involving indirect knowledge. The contradiction is in the claim that he couldn't know the exact position of the Ringmaster's head. \n\nThus, we will present the \"Note\" piece of evidence against the statement in testimony 4: \"That makes it impossible for me to have known the location of the Ringmaster's head.\"\n\nFinal Answer:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"present\",\n  \"testimony\": 4,\n  \"evidence\": 16\n}\n```",

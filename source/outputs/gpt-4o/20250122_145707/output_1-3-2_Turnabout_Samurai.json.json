    "response": "To find the contradiction in the testimony provided by Wendy Oldbag, we need to analyze her statements in light of the evidence we have. \n\n1. **Testimony Statement 6 & 7 Analysis:**\n   - Oldbag states, \"interesting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.\" \n   - She confirms, \"it was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio.\"\n\n2. **Evidence Comparison:**\n   - We have \"Powers's(?) Photo\" as evidence (evidence number 5). The description of this evidence states that the Steel Samurai was seen walking in a photo taken at the gate between the entrance and the studios, timestamped at \"Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2.\" The photo shows someone in a costume of the Steel Samurai, dragging one leg.\n\n3. **Logical Deduction:**\n   - While Oldbag claims she saw Will Powers, the evidence (photo) indicates that the person who passed by was in the Steel Samurai costume and was taken at precisely 2:00 PM. \n   - Will Powers himself stated he was sleeping, and the Steel Samurai suits completely cover the person wearing them, making it impossible for Oldbag to assert that it was Will Powers simply by sight.\n\n4. **Contradiction:**\n   - The contradiction arises because Oldbag insists she saw Powers, when the photo proves that the person was in a costume, thus she couldn't have accurately identified Powers.\n\nBased on this analysis, we will present the photo of Powers (evidence 5) against Oldbag's claim in testimony statement 7.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"present\",\n  \"testimony\": 7,\n  \"evidence\": 5\n}\n```",

    "response": "To determine if there is a contradiction in the testimony of the witness, let's analyze each part of the witness's account and compare it to the available evidence.\n\n1. **The time of poor Hammer's death was 2:30 PM, true?** \n   - The autopsy report (Evidence #3: Jack's Autopsy Report) confirms that the time of death was indeed at 2:30 PM. No contradiction here.\n\n2. **The only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers!**\n   - We have a security photo (Evidence #5: Powers's(?) Photo) showing the Steel Samurai costume heading toward the studio at 2:00 PM, but it does not definitively prove that it was Will Powers inside the costume.\n\n3. **No one else went there!**\n   - The evidence (Evidence #5: Powers's(?) Photo) could be argued to support or contradict this statement based on the time and context.\n\n4. **If they had, I would have seen them!**\n   - According to the evidence (Evidence #11: Mr. Monkey's Head), the path to the scene was blocked between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM. This creates a possible contradiction with the witness's testimonial since it implies that passage was obstructed and seeing someone could have been difficult or impossible.\n\nThe main testimony in question is the certainty that \"No one else went there!\" This can lead to a contradiction because if Mr. Monkey's Head was truly blocking the path, the claim that no one else, including the possibility of the Steel Samurai, being present contradicts the witness\u2019s ability to see everyone and everything during that timeframe.\n\nNow, let's present this contradiction using the available evidence.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"present\",\n  \"testimony\": 2,\n  \"evidence\": 11\n}\n```",

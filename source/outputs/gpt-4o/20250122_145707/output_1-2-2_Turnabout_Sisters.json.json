    "response": "To find the contradiction in Detective Gumshoe's testimony, we need to carefully compare it with the evidence provided. Let's go through each statement regarding the \"hard evidence\":\n\n1. **\"After securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.\"**\n   - This doesn't directly relate to any evidence contradictions but sets the stage for the following statements.\n\n2. **\"I found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!\"**\n   - This matches the \"Receipt\" evidence which has \"Maya's\" name written in blood on its back.\n\n3. **\"On it, the word 'Maya' was written clearly in blood!\"**\n   - This is consistent with what was found on the Receipt from evidence.\n\n4. **\"Lab test results showed that the blood was the victim's!\"**\n   - No contradiction here with the evidence mentioned.\n\n5. **\"Also, there was blood found on the victim's finger!\"**\n   - This is suggesting the victim wrote something, but is not directly contradicted by evidence.\n\n6. **\"Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!\"**\n   - This statement contradicts the \"Mia's Autopsy Report\" which initially stated death was instantaneous. Thus, it wouldn't be possible for Mia to have written anything if she died instantly.\n\nAfter analyzing the testimonies and evidence, it seems that the contradiction lies in the claim that Mia wrote the killer's name before dying. The autopsy report indicates that her death was either too immediate or sudden for her to have written anything. However, in the second version of the autopsy report, it is mentioned that she might have lived a few minutes after being hit.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction can be challenged with the second autopsy report that suggests she might have lived for a few minutes, thus challenging the certainty of the testimony.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"present\",\n  \"testimony\": 5,\n  \"evidence\": 5\n}\n```",

    "response": "To find a contradiction in April May's testimony, we need to carefully examine each statement and compare it with the evidence we have.\n\n1. **Testimony**: \"I did see everything! I did!\"\n   - This statement is a general assertion without specific details to cross-examine.\n\n2. **Testimony**: \"The victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right.\"\n   - There's no immediate contradiction here, but let's hold onto this detail for context.\n\n3. **Testimony**: \"Then the girl in the hippie clothes ran after her...\"\n   - This is consistent with May Testimony from the evidence list.\n\n4. **Testimony**: \"And she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did!\"\n   - A specific claim about witnessing the crime.\n  \n5. **Testimony**: \"That... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? 'The Thinker,' I think?\"\n   - **Contradiction**: This is where things get interesting. April May claims the weapon was a clock, specifically referring to \"The Thinker.\" According to the evidence list:\n     - The Thinker (Evidence 1) is indeed a clock that looks like a statue, but the clock's gears have been removed, making it non-functional.\n     - Mia's Autopsy Report (Evidence 5) mentions a single blow causing instantaneous death. This is problematic if allegedly witnessed; the removal of gears implies the current non-clock functionality was not obvious, challenging her detailed assertion of identifying the weapon as a clock.\n\nThe issue here is, if the witness truly witnessed the crime, the knowledge of it being a clock rather than just a statue might not align unless the clock was functional during the crime, contradicting its current state in evidence. \n\nHere she specifically mentions \"The Thinker,\" a statue noted to have its clock component, which the average observer might not immediately recognize unless implied through the clock's function\u2014a contradiction.\n\nGiven this explanation, let's present the appropriate evidence to challenge her testimony:\n\n- **Action**: Present evidence to contradict the testimony regarding the identification of \"The Thinker\" as a clock.\n- **Testimony Index**: 4 (0-based index for \"And she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did!\")\n- **Evidence Index**: 1 (0-based index for \"The Thinker\")\n\nFinal Answer:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"present\",\n  \"testimony\": 4,\n  \"evidence\": 1\n}\n```",

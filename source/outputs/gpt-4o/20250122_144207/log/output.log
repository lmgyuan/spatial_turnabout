The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say it was you...)Phoenix:\nMy name is Phoenix Wright. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\" In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!August 3, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.

Tell me, what's the victim's name?Phoenix:\n(Whew, I know this one! Glad I read the case report cover to cover so many times. It's... wait... Uh-oh! No... no way! I forgot! I'm drawing a total blank here!)Mia:\nPhoenix! Are you absolutely SURE you're up to this? You don't even know the victim's name!?Phoenix:\nOh, the victim! O-Of course I know the victim's name!

You've answered all my questions. I see no reason why we shouldn't proceed. You seem much more relaxed, Mr. Wright. Good for you.Phoenix:\nThank you, Your Honor. (Because I don't FEEL relaxed, that's for sure.)Judge:\nWell, then... First, a question for the prosecution. Mr. Payne?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nAs Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to the court just what that \"object\" was?Payne:\nThe murder weapon was this statue of \"The Thinker.\" It was found lying on the floor, next to the victim.Judge:\nI see... The court accepts it into evidence. (Changed from [I see... the court accepts it into evidence.] in the original release)Statue added to the Court Record.Mia:\nWright...

WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?Payne:\nMr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by \"dumped.\" In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!Butz:\nWhaddya mean, \"one of them\"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!Payne:\nYour Honor, the victim's passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.Passport added to the Court Record.Judge:\nHmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.Butz:\nDude... no way...Payne:\nThe victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several \"Sugar Daddies.\"Butz:\nDaddies? Sugar?Payne:\nYes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.Butz:\nDuuude!Payne:\nWe can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?Mia:\nWright... I don't think you want him to answer that question.Phoenix:\n(Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)Wait and see what happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Might be better not to get involved in this one...)\nPayne:\nWell, Mr. Butz?\nButz:\nDude, no way!

That question is irrelevant to this case!\nPayne:\nOof! *wince*\nButz:\nDude! Nick! Whaddya mean, \"irrelevant\"!? That cheatin' she-dog!\nLeads to:\n\"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!\"Butz:\nI'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I'm going to get to the bottom of this!Judge:\nLet's continue with the trial, shall we?Payne:\nI believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.Judge:\nYes, quite.Phoenix:\n(Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)Payne:\nNext question! You went to the victim's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?Butz:\nGulp!Payne:\nWell, did you, or did you not?Butz:\nHeh? Heh heh.

Well then, we'll just have to remind you!\nPhoenix:\n(I got a bad feeling about this...)\nPayne:\nWe have a witness that can prove he DID go to the victim's apartment that day!\nLeads to:\n\"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?\"Judge:\nWell, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?Payne:\nThe man who found the victim's body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw the defendant fleeing the scene of the crime!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.Payne:\nYes, Your Honor.Phoenix:\n(This is bad...)Payne:\nOn the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim's building.

However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.Blackout Record added to the Court Record.Judge:\nNow, Mr. Wright...Phoenix:\nYes! Er... yes, Your Honor?Judge:\nYou may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:\nC-Cross-examination, Your Honor?Mia:\nAlright, Wright, this is it. The real deal!Phoenix:\nUh... what exactly am I supposed to do?Mia:\nWhy, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!Phoenix:\nLies! What?! He was lying!?Mia:\nYour client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?Phoenix:\n!!! How do I prove he's not?Mia:\nYou hold the key! It's in the evidence! Compare the witness's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there!

During the cross-examination, identify the contradiction in the witness's testimony by presenting the appropriate evidence at the correct statement.
In this example, the witness claims to remember the time exactly as 1:00 PM, but the Cindy's Autopsy Report records the time of death between 4 PM-5 PM. This discrepancy can be presented as evidence to contradict the witness's statement.

Answer:
{
  "action": "present",
  "testimony": 9,
  "evidence": 2
}You may now present evidence that is helpful in finding a contradiction in the testimony. To present evidence, answer the question with a JSON object in the format of {"action": "present", "testimony": <number of the testimony>, "evidence": <number of the evidence>}, for example {"action": "present", "testimony": 5, "evidence": 2}.
Note that the evidence, character, and testimony is listed from 0 to n-1, so your response should be 0-indexed.
Explain your reasoning step by step before providing the JSON object. 
 Conclude your answer with "Final Answer:" followed by the JSON object on a new line.
Do not write any things after the JSON and make sure you use "Final Answer:" followed by the JSON object.
The following is the context of the case that you may find useful in helping you make a decision:

Listen, Wright! (Changed from [Wright!] in the original release) The defendant is the one on trial--your client! (Changed from [Listen: the defendant is the one on trial--your client!] in the original release) I mean, that's about as basic as you can get!
Phoenix:
(I've put my foot in it this time! I've got to relax!)
Judge:
Sorry, I couldn't hear your answer. I'll ask once more:
Leads back to:
"Please state the name of the defendant in this case."Phoenix:
The defendant? Well, that's Larry Butz, Your Honor.Judge:
Correct. Just keep your wits about you and you'll do fine. Next question: This is a murder trial. Tell me, what's the victim's name?Phoenix:
(Whew, I know this one! Glad I read the case report cover to cover so many times. It's... wait... Uh-oh! No... no way! I forgot! I'm drawing a total blank here!)Mia:
Phoenix! Are you absolutely SURE you're up to this? You don't even know the victim's name!?Phoenix:
Oh, the victim! O-Of course I know the victim's name! I, um, just forgot. ...Temporarily (Changed from [I, um, just forgot. ... Temporarily.] in the original release)Mia:
I think I feel a migraine coming on. Look, the victim's name is listed in the Court Record. Just press [the R Button / Tab] to check it at any time, okay? (Changed from [Just touch the Court Record button to check it at any time, okay?] in the original release) Remember to check it often. Do it for me, please. I'm begging you.Judge:
Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?Mia Fey







Phoenix:
Um... Mia Fey?
Mia:
W-W-What!? How can I be the victim!?
Phoenix:
Oh! Right! Sorry! I, er, it was the first name that popped into my head, and--
Mia:
The Court Record button! Remember to use it when you're in a pinch with [the R Button / Tab]. (Changed from [Remember to use it when you're in a pinch.] in the original release)
Judge:
Let me ask that one again:
Leads back to:
"Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?"Cinder Block







Phoenix:
Oh, um, wasn't it Ms. Block? Ms. Cinder Block?
Judge:
The person in question was a victim of murder, not ill-conceived naming, Mr. Wright.
Mia:
Wright? If you forget something, use [the R Button / Tab] to check the Court Record and jog your memory. (Changed from [If you forget something, [just touch the Court Record button to help you remember.] in the original release) A mistake in court could cost you the case.
Judge:
I'll ask you again:
Leads back to:
"Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?"Cindy Stone







Leads to:
"Um... the victim's name is Cindy Stone."Phoenix:
Um... the victim's name is Cindy Stone.Judge:
Correct. Now, tell me, what was the cause of death? She died because she was...?Poisoned







Phoenix:
Oh, right! Wasn't she, um, poisoned by er... poison?
Judge:
You're asking me!?
Phoenix:
Um... Chief! Help me out!
Mia:
Check the court record. [The R Button / Tab]... remember? (Changed from [Check the court record. The Court Record button... remember?] in the original release)
Phoenix:
(Geez. Give a guy a break!)
Judge:
Let me ask again.
Leads back to:
"She died because she was...?"Hit with a blunt object







Leads to:
"She was struck once, by a blunt object."Strangled







Phoenix:
Right... she was strangled, wasn't she?
Mia:
Please tell me that was you talking to yourself.
Judge:
If you wish to hang yourself, Mr. Wright, you're welcome to, but not inside my courtroom. I suppose there's nothing to do but give you another try:
Leads back to:
"She died because she was...?"Phoenix:
She was struck once, by a blunt object.Judge:
Correct. You've answered all my questions. I see no reason why we shouldn't proceed. You seem much more relaxed, Mr. Wright. Good for you.Phoenix:
Thank you, Your Honor. (Because I don't FEEL relaxed, that's for sure.)Judge:
Well, then... First, a question for the prosecution. Mr. Payne?Payne:
Yes, Your Honor?Judge:
As Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to the court just what that "object" was?Payne:
The murder weapon was this statue of "The Thinker." It was found lying on the floor, next to the victim.Judge:
I see... The court accepts it into evidence. (Changed from [I see... the court accepts it into evidence.] in the original release)Statue added to the Court Record.Mia:
Wright... Be sure to pay attention to any evidence added during the trial. That evidence is the only ammunition you have in court. [Touch the Court Record button / Use the R Button] to check the Court Record frequently.Judge:
Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its first witness.Payne:
The prosecution calls the defendant, Mr. Butz, to the stand.Phoenix:
Um, Chief, what do I do now?Mia:
Pay attention. You don't want to miss any information that might help your client's case. You'll get your chance to respond to the prosecution later, so be ready! Let's just hope he doesn't say anything... unfortunate.Phoenix:
(Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... This could be bad.) (Changed from [Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... this could be bad.] in the original release)Payne:
Ahem. Mr. Butz. Is it not true that the victim had recently dumped you?Butz:
Hey, watch it buddy! We were great together! We were Romeo and Juliet, Cleopatra and Mark Anthony!Phoenix:
(Um... didn't they all die?)Butz:
I wasn't dumped! She just wasn't taking my phone calls. Or seeing me... Ever. WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?Payne:
Mr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by "dumped." In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!Butz:
Whaddya mean, "one of them"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!Payne:
Your Honor, the victim's passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.Passport added to the Court Record.Judge:
Hmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.Butz:
Dude... no way...Payne:
The victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several "Sugar Daddies."Butz:
Daddies? Sugar?Payne:
Yes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.Butz:
Duuude!Payne:
We can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?Mia:
Wright... I don't think you want him to answer that question.Phoenix:
(Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)Wait and see what happens







Phoenix:
(Might be better not to get involved in this one...)
Payne:
Well, Mr. Butz?
Butz:
Dude, no way! That cheatin' she-dog!
Leads to:
"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!"Stop him from answering







Phoenix:
My client had no idea the victim was seeing other men! That question is irrelevant to this case!
Payne:
Oof! *wince*
Butz:
Dude! Nick! Whaddya mean, "irrelevant"!? That cheatin' she-dog!
Leads to:
"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!"Butz:
I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I'm going to get to the bottom of this!Judge:
Let's continue with the trial, shall we?Payne:
I believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.Judge:
Yes, quite.Phoenix:
(Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)Payne:
Next question! You went to the victim's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?Butz:
Gulp!Payne:
Well, did you, or did you not?Butz:
Heh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn't!Phoenix:
(Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)Have him answer honestly







Phoenix:
(I know! I'll send him a signal...)

(TELL THE TRUTH)

Butz:
Er... Yeah! Yeah! I was there! I went!
Judge:
Order! Well, Mr. Butz?
Butz:
Dude, chill! She wasn't home, man... So, like, I didn't see her.
Payne:

Payne:
Your Honor, the defendant is lying.
Judge:
Lying?
Payne:
The prosecution would like to call a witness who can prove Mr. Butz is lying.
Leads to:
"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"Stop him from answering







Phoenix:
(I'll send him a signal...)

(LIE LIKE A DOG)

Butz:
Um, well, see, it's like this: I don't remember.
Payne:
You "don't remember"? Well then, we'll just have to remind you!
Phoenix:
(I got a bad feeling about this...)
Payne:
We have a witness that can prove he DID go to the victim's apartment that day!
Leads to:
"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"Judge:
Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?Payne:
The man who found the victim's body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw the defendant fleeing the scene of the crime!Judge:
Order! Order in the court! Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.Payne:
Yes, Your Honor.Phoenix:
(This is bad...)Payne:
On the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim's building. Please bring Mr. Frank Sahwit to the stand!Payne:
Mr. Sahwit, you sell newspaper subscriptions, is this correct?Sahwit:
Oh, oh yes! Newspapers, yes!Judge:
Mr. Sahwit, you may proceed with your testimony. Please tell the court what you saw on the day of the murder.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Sahwit:
I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.
I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.
Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.
Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!
I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.
I thought to call the police immediately!
However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.
I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.
I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.
The man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Judge:
Hmm...Phoenix:
(Larry! Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!)Judge:
Incidentally, why wasn't the phone in the victim's apartment working?Payne:
Your Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.Judge:
Aren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?Payne:
Yes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.Blackout Record added to the Court Record.Judge:
Now, Mr. Wright...Phoenix:
Yes! Er... yes, Your Honor?Judge:
You may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:
C-Cross-examination, Your Honor?Mia:
Alright, Wright, this is it. The real deal!Phoenix:
Uh... what exactly am I supposed to do?Mia:
Why, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!Phoenix:
Lies! What?! He was lying!?Mia:
Your client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?Phoenix:
!!! How do I prove he's not?Mia:
You hold the key! It's in the evidence! Compare the witness's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there! First, find contradictions between the Court Record and the witness's testimony. Then, once you've found the contradicting evidence... present it and rub it in the witness's face!Phoenix:
Um... okay.Mia:
Open the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab], then point out contradictions in the testimony! (Changed from [Touch the Court Record button and point out contradictions in the testimony!] in the original release)Cross Examination

2025-01-22 14:42:13,322 - INFO - Assistant reply: To identify the contradiction in the witness's testimony, we need to closely analyze his claim and compare it to the pieces of evidence available.

1. **Testimony Analysis:**
   - Frank Sahwit testifies that he remembers the exact time as 1:00 PM when he found the victim.
   - He claims he discovered the body at this precise time.

2. **Contradicting Evidence:**
   - **Cindy's Autopsy Report:** This document clearly states that the time of death was between 4 PM-5 PM. If the victim was still alive until this time, it would be impossible for Sahwit to have found her body at 1:00 PM, as he testified.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - There is a clear contradiction between the testimony and the autopsy report regarding the time of the victim's death and the time Sahwit claims to have discovered the body.
   - This discrepancy indicates that Sahwit is either mistaken or deliberately lying about the time he found the body.

4. **Action:**
   - By presenting Cindy's Autopsy Report when Sahwit mentions the exact time (which is testimony point 8), we can point out this contradiction to the court.

The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say it was you...)Phoenix:\nMy name is Phoenix Wright. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\" In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one.

Dammit! ...Why me? I can't get caught... Not like this! I-I've gotta find someone to pin this on... Someone like... him! I'll make it look like HE did it!August 3, 9:47 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2Phoenix:
(Boy am I nervous!)Mia:
Wright!Phoenix:
Oh, h-hiya, Chief.Mia:
Whew, I'm glad I made it on time. Well, I have to say Phoenix, I'm impressed! Not everyone takes on a murder trial right off the bat like this. It says a lot about you... and your client as well.Phoenix:
Um... thanks. Actually, it's because I owe him a favor.Mia:
A favor? You mean, you knew the defendant before this case?Phoenix:
Yes. Actually, I kind of owe my current job to him. He's one of the reasons I became an attorney.Mia:
Well, that's news to me!Phoenix:
I want to help him out any way I can! I just... really want to help him. I owe him that much.???:
(It's over! My life, everything, it's all over!)Mia:
... Is that your client screaming over there? (Changed from [Isn't that your client screaming over there?] in the original release)Phoenix:
Yeah... it's him. (Changed from [Yeah... that's him.] in the original release)???:
(Death! Despair! Ohhhh! I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna die!!!)Mia:
It sounds like he wants to die...Phoenix:
Um, yeah. *sigh*Butz:
Nick!!!Phoenix:
Hey. Hey there, Larry.Butz:
Dude, I'm so guilty!! Tell them I'm guilty!!! Gimme the death sentence! I ain't afraid to die!Phoenix:
What!? What's wrong, Larry?Butz:
Oh, it's all over... I... I'm finished. Finished! I can't live in a world without her! I can't! Who... who took her away from me, Nick? Who did this!? Aww, Nick, ya gotta tell me! Who took my baby away!?Phoenix:
(Hmm... The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say it was you...)Phoenix:
My name is Phoenix Wright. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: "When something smells, it's usually the Butz." In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!August 3, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz. (Changed from [The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.] in the original release)Payne:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The, um, defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:
Ahem. Mr. Wright? This is your first trial, is it not?Phoenix:
Y-Yes, Your Honor. I'm, um, a little nervous.Judge:
Your conduct during this trial will decide the fate of your client. Murder is a serious charge. For your client's sake, I hope you can control your nerves.Phoenix:
Thank... thank you, Your Honor.Judge:
... Mr. Wright, given the circumstances... I think we should have a test to ascertain your readiness.Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. (Gulp... Hands shaking... Eyesight... fading...)Judge:
This test will consist of a few simple questions. Answer them clearly and concisely. Please state the name of the defendant in this case.Phoenix Wright







Phoenix:
Um... the defendant... is me... right? (Changed from [Um... the defendant... is me, right?] in the original release)
Mia:
Wright! Have you completely lost your mind? Focus! The defendant is the person on trial! You're his lawyer!
Phoenix:
Um, er, eh? Oh yeah, right! Eh heh heh.
Mia:
This is no laughing matter! You did pass the bar, didn't you?
Judge:
Sorry, I couldn't hear your answer. I'll ask once more:
Leads back to:
"Please state the name of the defendant in this case."Larry Butz







Leads to:
"The defendant? Well, that's Larry Butz, Your Honor."Mia Fey







Phoenix:
The, um, defendant? That's... er... Mia Fey?
Mia:
Wrong, Wright. Look, I have to leave. I have to go home. I'm... I'm expecting a delivery.
Phoenix:
Aw, c'mon Chief. There's no need to be going so soon, is there?
Mia:
Listen, Wright! (Changed from [Wright!] in the original release) The defendant is the one on trial--your client! (Changed from [Listen: the defendant is the one on trial--your client!] in the original release) I mean, that's about as basic as you can get!
Phoenix:
(I've put my foot in it this time! I've got to relax!)
Judge:
Sorry, I couldn't hear your answer. I'll ask once more:
Leads back to:
"Please state the name of the defendant in this case."Phoenix:
The defendant? Well, that's Larry Butz, Your Honor.Judge:
Correct. Just keep your wits about you and you'll do fine. Next question: This is a murder trial. Tell me, what's the victim's name?Phoenix:
(Whew, I know this one! Glad I read the case report cover to cover so many times. It's... wait... Uh-oh! No... no way! I forgot! I'm drawing a total blank here!)Mia:
Phoenix! Are you absolutely SURE you're up to this? You don't even know the victim's name!?Phoenix:
Oh, the victim! O-Of course I know the victim's name! I, um, just forgot. ...Temporarily (Changed from [I, um, just forgot. ... Temporarily.] in the original release)Mia:
I think I feel a migraine coming on. Look, the victim's name is listed in the Court Record. Just press [the R Button / Tab] to check it at any time, okay? (Changed from [Just touch the Court Record button to check it at any time, okay?] in the original release) Remember to check it often. Do it for me, please. I'm begging you.Judge:
Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?Mia Fey







Phoenix:
Um... Mia Fey?
Mia:
W-W-What!? How can I be the victim!?
Phoenix:
Oh! Right! Sorry! I, er, it was the first name that popped into my head, and--
Mia:
The Court Record button! Remember to use it when you're in a pinch with [the R Button / Tab]. (Changed from [Remember to use it when you're in a pinch.] in the original release)
Judge:
Let me ask that one again:
Leads back to:
"Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?"Cinder Block







Phoenix:
Oh, um, wasn't it Ms. Block? Ms. Cinder Block?
Judge:
The person in question was a victim of murder, not ill-conceived naming, Mr. Wright.
Mia:
Wright? If you forget something, use [the R Button / Tab] to check the Court Record and jog your memory. (Changed from [If you forget something, [just touch the Court Record button to help you remember.] in the original release) A mistake in court could cost you the case.
Judge:
I'll ask you again:
Leads back to:
"Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?"Cindy Stone







Leads to:
"Um... the victim's name is Cindy Stone."Phoenix:
Um... the victim's name is Cindy Stone.Judge:
Correct. Now, tell me, what was the cause of death? She died because she was...?Poisoned







Phoenix:
Oh, right! Wasn't she, um, poisoned by er... poison?
Judge:
You're asking me!?
Phoenix:
Um... Chief! Help me out!
Mia:
Check the court record. [The R Button / Tab]... remember? (Changed from [Check the court record. The Court Record button... remember?] in the original release)
Phoenix:
(Geez. Give a guy a break!)
Judge:
Let me ask again.
Leads back to:
"She died because she was...?"Hit with a blunt object







Leads to:
"She was struck once, by a blunt object."Strangled







Phoenix:
Right... she was strangled, wasn't she?
Mia:
Please tell me that was you talking to yourself.
Judge:
If you wish to hang yourself, Mr. Wright, you're welcome to, but not inside my courtroom. I suppose there's nothing to do but give you another try:
Leads back to:
"She died because she was...?"Phoenix:
She was struck once, by a blunt object.Judge:
Correct. You've answered all my questions. I see no reason why we shouldn't proceed. You seem much more relaxed, Mr. Wright. Good for you.Phoenix:
Thank you, Your Honor. (Because I don't FEEL relaxed, that's for sure.)Judge:
Well, then... First, a question for the prosecution. Mr. Payne?Payne:
Yes, Your Honor?Judge:
As Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to the court just what that "object" was?Payne:
The murder weapon was this statue of "The Thinker." It was found lying on the floor, next to the victim.Judge:
I see... The court accepts it into evidence. (Changed from [I see... the court accepts it into evidence.] in the original release)Statue added to the Court Record.Mia:
Wright... Be sure to pay attention to any evidence added during the trial. That evidence is the only ammunition you have in court. [Touch the Court Record button / Use the R Button] to check the Court Record frequently.Judge:
Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its first witness.Payne:
The prosecution calls the defendant, Mr. Butz, to the stand.Phoenix:
Um, Chief, what do I do now?Mia:
Pay attention. You don't want to miss any information that might help your client's case. You'll get your chance to respond to the prosecution later, so be ready! Let's just hope he doesn't say anything... unfortunate.Phoenix:
(Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... This could be bad.) (Changed from [Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... this could be bad.] in the original release)Payne:
Ahem. Mr. Butz. Is it not true that the victim had recently dumped you?Butz:
Hey, watch it buddy! We were great together! We were Romeo and Juliet, Cleopatra and Mark Anthony!Phoenix:
(Um... didn't they all die?)Butz:
I wasn't dumped! She just wasn't taking my phone calls. Or seeing me... Ever. WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?Payne:
Mr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by "dumped." In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!Butz:
Whaddya mean, "one of them"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!Payne:
Your Honor, the victim's passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.Passport added to the Court Record.Judge:
Hmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.Butz:
Dude... no way...Payne:
The victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several "Sugar Daddies."Butz:
Daddies? Sugar?Payne:
Yes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.Butz:
Duuude!Payne:
We can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?Mia:
Wright... I don't think you want him to answer that question.Phoenix:
(Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)Wait and see what happens







Phoenix:
(Might be better not to get involved in this one...)
Payne:
Well, Mr. Butz?
Butz:
Dude, no way! That cheatin' she-dog!
Leads to:
"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!"Stop him from answering







Phoenix:
My client had no idea the victim was seeing other men! That question is irrelevant to this case!
Payne:
Oof! *wince*
Butz:
Dude! Nick! Whaddya mean, "irrelevant"!? That cheatin' she-dog!
Leads to:
"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!"Butz:
I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I'm going to get to the bottom of this!Judge:
Let's continue with the trial, shall we?Payne:
I believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.Judge:
Yes, quite.Phoenix:
(Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)Payne:
Next question! You went to the victim's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?Butz:
Gulp!Payne:
Well, did you, or did you not?Butz:
Heh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn't!Phoenix:
(Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)Have him answer honestly







Phoenix:
(I know! I'll send him a signal...)

(TELL THE TRUTH)

Butz:
Er... Yeah! Yeah! I was there! I went!
Judge:
Order! Well, Mr. Butz?
Butz:
Dude, chill! She wasn't home, man... So, like, I didn't see her.
Payne:

Payne:
Your Honor, the defendant is lying.
Judge:
Lying?
Payne:
The prosecution would like to call a witness who can prove Mr. Butz is lying.
Leads to:
"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"Stop him from answering







Phoenix:
(I'll send him a signal...)

(LIE LIKE A DOG)

Butz:
Um, well, see, it's like this: I don't remember.
Payne:
You "don't remember"? Well then, we'll just have to remind you!
Phoenix:
(I got a bad feeling about this...)
Payne:
We have a witness that can prove he DID go to the victim's apartment that day!
Leads to:
"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"Judge:
Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?Payne:
The man who found the victim's body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw the defendant fleeing the scene of the crime!Judge:
Order! Order in the court! Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.Payne:
Yes, Your Honor.Phoenix:
(This is bad...)Payne:
On the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim's building. Please bring Mr. Frank Sahwit to the stand!Payne:
Mr. Sahwit, you sell newspaper subscriptions, is this correct?Sahwit:
Oh, oh yes! Newspapers, yes!Judge:
Mr. Sahwit, you may proceed with your testimony. Please tell the court what you saw on the day of the murder.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Sahwit:
I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.
I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.
Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.
Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!
I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.
I thought to call the police immediately!
However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.
I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.
I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.
The man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Judge:
Hmm...Phoenix:
(Larry! Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!)Judge:
Incidentally, why wasn't the phone in the victim's apartment working?Payne:
Your Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.Judge:
Aren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?Payne:
Yes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.Blackout Record added to the Court Record.Judge:

Yes! Er... yes, Your Honor?Judge:
You may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:
C-Cross-examination, Your Honor?Mia:
Alright, Wright, this is it. The real deal!Phoenix:
Uh... what exactly am I supposed to do?Mia:
Why, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!Phoenix:
Lies! What?! He was lying!?Mia:
Your client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Isn't a man leaving an apartment a common sight? I find it odd you would take notice of him...
Sahwit:
Er... heh. I don't know. He just seemed strange to me, that's all. Like he was mad, and yet frightened at the same time. Just like... a criminal fleeing the scene of a crime!
Phoenix:
The defense requests that the witness refrain from conjecture!
Payne:
Of course. What the witness means is that the man he saw looked suspicious. So, what happened next?Sahwit:
I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Half-open... you say?
Sahwit:
Yes, yes, the door was open halfway. Yes. I watched for a moment, but no one came to close the door. "That's odd, in a big city like this," I thought...
Payne:
I see. And what happened next?Sahwit:
Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What gave you the idea to do that?
Sahwit:
Well, the door was half-open, you see. Isn't it only human to want to... peek? We climb mountains because they are there! It's the same thing.
Payne:
Truer words have never been spoken! Anyone would look inside!

Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Are you sure she was dead?
Sahwit:
W-Well, no, I guess I wasn't. But, she wasn't moving at all, and there was blood everywhere.
Phoenix:

I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So, you didn't touch ANYTHING in the apartment?
Sahwit:
Um, yes. I mean no! Nothing.

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
You "thought" to call the police? Does that mean you didn't actually call them!?

Sahwit:
Yes. I mean, no. No, it wasn't. Right. (Changed from [Yes. I mean, no, no it wasn't. Right.] in the original release)
Phoenix:
But you said you didn't go into the apartment... or did you!?
Sahwit:
Oh, oh, that? I can explain that! There was a cordless phone on a shelf in the entranceway. I reached inside and tried using that to call...
Payne:
And the phone wasn't working, correct? What happened next?Sahwit:
I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Why use a public phone?
Sahwit:
Well, you see, I don't have a cell phone. And, being the middle of the afternoon, there was no answer at the nearby apartments.

Phoenix:
1:00 PM! Are you certain?

That's all of it. There must be a contradiction in there somewhere. Examine the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab] if something strikes you as being suspicious. (Changed from [Examine the Court Record button if something strikes you as being suspicious.] in the original release) Then, find the evidence that contradicts his testimony, and present it to the court!Phoenix:
You found the body at 1:00 PM. You're sure?Sahwit:
Yes. It was 1:00 PM, for certain.Phoenix:
Frankly, I find that hard to believe! Your statement directly contradicts the autopsy report. The autopsy notes the time of death at sometime after 4PM. There was nobody to... er... no "body" to find at 1:00 PM! How do you explain this three-hour gap?Sahwit:
!!! Oh, that! Oh, er...Payne:Payne:
This is trivial! The witness merely forgot the time!Judge:
After his testimony, I find that hard to believe. Mr. Sahwit... Why were you so certain that you found the body at 1:00 PM?Sahwit:
I... er... well, I... Gee, that's a really good question!Mia:
Great job, Wright! Way to put him on the spot! That's all you have to do: point out contradictions! Lies always beget more lies! See through one, and their whole story falls apart!Sahwit:
Wait! I remember now!Judge:
Would you care to give your testimony again?Witness Testimony-- The Time of Discovery --Sahwit:
You see, when I found the body, I heard the time.
There was a voice saying the time... It was probably coming from the television.
Oh, but it was three hours off, wasn't it?
I guess the victim must have been watching a video of a taped program!
That's why I thought it was 1:00 PM!
Terribly sorry about the misunderstanding...Judge:
Hmm... I see. You heard a voice saying the time on a taped program. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Mia:
Wright! You know what to do!Phoenix:
I've got this one.Cross Examination

2025-01-22 14:42:26,194 - INFO - Assistant reply: Let's analyze the second testimony provided by the witness, Frank Sahwit.

1. **Witness Statement**: "You see, when I found the body, I heard the time."
   - This statement does not need immediate contradiction. We need more context on how he "heard" the time.

2. **Witness Statement**: "There was a voice saying the time... It was probably coming from the television."
   - Sahwit claims the time was broadcasted from a television. This could be plausible under normal circumstances unless there's a contradiction.

3. **Witness Statement**: "Oh, but it was three hours off, wasn't it?"
   - He acknowledges the discrepancy in time, but implies it was related to a timing issue.

4. **Witness Statement**: "I guess the victim must have been watching a video of a taped program!"
   - This is Sahwit's explanation for the discrepancy—a taped program being one explanation for incorrect timing.

5. **Witness Statement**: "That's why I thought it was 1:00 PM!"
   - He is justifying why he might have been mistaken about the exact time.

6. **Witness Statement**: "Terribly sorry about the misunderstanding..."
   - This does not provide information relevant to the contradiction for the case in the current context.

**Contradiction Identification**:
- **Key Evidence**: 
  - The Blackout Record (Evidence number 4) states there was no electricity from noon to 6 PM. Hence, a television could not have been on during the time Sahwit claims to have heard a time announced.

- **Critical Statement**: 
  - Statement 1: "You see, when I found the body, I heard the time."
  - Statement 2: "There was a voice saying the time... It was probably coming from the television."

Since there was a blackout from noon to 6 PM, any claim about hearing the time from a television during this period is false. Thus, the contradiction arises when Sahwit claims to have heard the time from the television, which shouldn't have been operational due to the blackout.

**Final Answer**:

The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say it was you...)Phoenix:\nMy name is Phoenix Wright. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\" In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!August 3, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.

Hey. Hey there, Larry.Butz:
Dude, I'm so guilty!! Tell them I'm guilty!!! Gimme the death sentence! I ain't afraid to die!Phoenix:

Oh, it's all over... I... I'm finished. Finished! I can't live in a world without her! I can't! Who... who took her away from me, Nick? Who did this!? Aww, Nick, ya gotta tell me! Who took my baby away!?Phoenix:
(Hmm... The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say it was you...)Phoenix:
My name is Phoenix Wright. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: "When something smells, it's usually the Butz." In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!August 3, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz. (Changed from [The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.] in the original release)Payne:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The, um, defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:
Ahem. Mr. Wright? This is your first trial, is it not?Phoenix:
Y-Yes, Your Honor. I'm, um, a little nervous.Judge:
Your conduct during this trial will decide the fate of your client. Murder is a serious charge. For your client's sake, I hope you can control your nerves.Phoenix:
Thank... thank you, Your Honor.Judge:
... Mr. Wright, given the circumstances... I think we should have a test to ascertain your readiness.Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. (Gulp... Hands shaking... Eyesight... fading...)Judge:
This test will consist of a few simple questions. Answer them clearly and concisely. Please state the name of the defendant in this case.Phoenix Wright







Phoenix:
Um... the defendant... is me... right? (Changed from [Um... the defendant... is me, right?] in the original release)
Mia:
Wright! Have you completely lost your mind? Focus! The defendant is the person on trial! You're his lawyer!
Phoenix:
Um, er, eh? Oh yeah, right! Eh heh heh.
Mia:
This is no laughing matter! You did pass the bar, didn't you?
Judge:
Sorry, I couldn't hear your answer. I'll ask once more:
Leads back to:
"Please state the name of the defendant in this case."Larry Butz







Leads to:
"The defendant? Well, that's Larry Butz, Your Honor."Mia Fey







Phoenix:
The, um, defendant? That's... er... Mia Fey?
Mia:
Wrong, Wright. Look, I have to leave. I have to go home. I'm... I'm expecting a delivery.
Phoenix:
Aw, c'mon Chief. There's no need to be going so soon, is there?
Mia:
Listen, Wright! (Changed from [Wright!] in the original release) The defendant is the one on trial--your client! (Changed from [Listen: the defendant is the one on trial--your client!] in the original release) I mean, that's about as basic as you can get!
Phoenix:
(I've put my foot in it this time! I've got to relax!)
Judge:
Sorry, I couldn't hear your answer. I'll ask once more:
Leads back to:
"Please state the name of the defendant in this case."Phoenix:
The defendant? Well, that's Larry Butz, Your Honor.Judge:
Correct. Just keep your wits about you and you'll do fine. Next question: This is a murder trial. Tell me, what's the victim's name?Phoenix:
(Whew, I know this one! Glad I read the case report cover to cover so many times. It's... wait... Uh-oh! No... no way! I forgot! I'm drawing a total blank here!)Mia:
Phoenix! Are you absolutely SURE you're up to this? You don't even know the victim's name!?Phoenix:
Oh, the victim! O-Of course I know the victim's name! I, um, just forgot. ...Temporarily (Changed from [I, um, just forgot. ... Temporarily.] in the original release)Mia:
I think I feel a migraine coming on. Look, the victim's name is listed in the Court Record. Just press [the R Button / Tab] to check it at any time, okay? (Changed from [Just touch the Court Record button to check it at any time, okay?] in the original release) Remember to check it often. Do it for me, please. I'm begging you.Judge:
Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?Mia Fey







Phoenix:
Um... Mia Fey?
Mia:
W-W-What!? How can I be the victim!?
Phoenix:
Oh! Right! Sorry! I, er, it was the first name that popped into my head, and--
Mia:
The Court Record button! Remember to use it when you're in a pinch with [the R Button / Tab]. (Changed from [Remember to use it when you're in a pinch.] in the original release)
Judge:
Let me ask that one again:
Leads back to:
"Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?"Cinder Block







Phoenix:
Oh, um, wasn't it Ms. Block? Ms. Cinder Block?
Judge:
The person in question was a victim of murder, not ill-conceived naming, Mr. Wright.
Mia:
Wright? If you forget something, use [the R Button / Tab] to check the Court Record and jog your memory. (Changed from [If you forget something, [just touch the Court Record button to help you remember.] in the original release) A mistake in court could cost you the case.
Judge:
I'll ask you again:
Leads back to:
"Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?"Cindy Stone







Leads to:
"Um... the victim's name is Cindy Stone."Phoenix:
Um... the victim's name is Cindy Stone.Judge:
Correct. Now, tell me, what was the cause of death? She died because she was...?Poisoned







Phoenix:
Oh, right! Wasn't she, um, poisoned by er... poison?
Judge:
You're asking me!?
Phoenix:
Um... Chief! Help me out!
Mia:
Check the court record. [The R Button / Tab]... remember? (Changed from [Check the court record. The Court Record button... remember?] in the original release)
Phoenix:
(Geez. Give a guy a break!)
Judge:
Let me ask again.
Leads back to:
"She died because she was...?"Hit with a blunt object







Leads to:
"She was struck once, by a blunt object."Strangled







Phoenix:
Right... she was strangled, wasn't she?
Mia:
Please tell me that was you talking to yourself.
Judge:
If you wish to hang yourself, Mr. Wright, you're welcome to, but not inside my courtroom. I suppose there's nothing to do but give you another try:
Leads back to:
"She died because she was...?"Phoenix:
She was struck once, by a blunt object.Judge:
Correct. You've answered all my questions. I see no reason why we shouldn't proceed. You seem much more relaxed, Mr. Wright. Good for you.Phoenix:
Thank you, Your Honor. (Because I don't FEEL relaxed, that's for sure.)Judge:
Well, then... First, a question for the prosecution. Mr. Payne?Payne:
Yes, Your Honor?Judge:
As Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to the court just what that "object" was?Payne:
The murder weapon was this statue of "The Thinker." It was found lying on the floor, next to the victim.Judge:
I see... The court accepts it into evidence. (Changed from [I see... the court accepts it into evidence.] in the original release)Statue added to the Court Record.Mia:
Wright... Be sure to pay attention to any evidence added during the trial. That evidence is the only ammunition you have in court. [Touch the Court Record button / Use the R Button] to check the Court Record frequently.Judge:
Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its first witness.Payne:
The prosecution calls the defendant, Mr. Butz, to the stand.Phoenix:
Um, Chief, what do I do now?Mia:
Pay attention. You don't want to miss any information that might help your client's case. You'll get your chance to respond to the prosecution later, so be ready! Let's just hope he doesn't say anything... unfortunate.Phoenix:
(Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... This could be bad.) (Changed from [Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... this could be bad.] in the original release)Payne:
Ahem. Mr. Butz. Is it not true that the victim had recently dumped you?Butz:
Hey, watch it buddy! We were great together! We were Romeo and Juliet, Cleopatra and Mark Anthony!Phoenix:
(Um... didn't they all die?)Butz:
I wasn't dumped! She just wasn't taking my phone calls. Or seeing me... Ever. WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?Payne:
Mr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by "dumped." In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!Butz:
Whaddya mean, "one of them"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!Payne:
Your Honor, the victim's passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.Passport added to the Court Record.Judge:
Hmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.Butz:
Dude... no way...Payne:
The victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several "Sugar Daddies."Butz:
Daddies? Sugar?Payne:
Yes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.Butz:
Duuude!Payne:
We can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?Mia:
Wright... I don't think you want him to answer that question.Phoenix:
(Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)Wait and see what happens







Phoenix:
(Might be better not to get involved in this one...)
Payne:
Well, Mr. Butz?
Butz:
Dude, no way! That cheatin' she-dog!
Leads to:
"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!"Stop him from answering







Phoenix:
My client had no idea the victim was seeing other men! That question is irrelevant to this case!
Payne:
Oof! *wince*
Butz:
Dude! Nick! Whaddya mean, "irrelevant"!? That cheatin' she-dog!
Leads to:
"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!"Butz:
I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I'm going to get to the bottom of this!Judge:
Let's continue with the trial, shall we?Payne:
I believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.Judge:
Yes, quite.Phoenix:
(Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)Payne:
Next question! You went to the victim's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?Butz:
Gulp!Payne:
Well, did you, or did you not?Butz:
Heh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn't!Phoenix:
(Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)Have him answer honestly







Phoenix:
(I know! I'll send him a signal...)

(TELL THE TRUTH)

Butz:
Er... Yeah! Yeah! I was there! I went!
Judge:
Order! Well, Mr. Butz?
Butz:
Dude, chill! She wasn't home, man... So, like, I didn't see her.
Payne:

Payne:
Your Honor, the defendant is lying.
Judge:
Lying?
Payne:
The prosecution would like to call a witness who can prove Mr. Butz is lying.
Leads to:
"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"Stop him from answering







Phoenix:
(I'll send him a signal...)

(LIE LIKE A DOG)

Butz:
Um, well, see, it's like this: I don't remember.
Payne:
You "don't remember"? Well then, we'll just have to remind you!
Phoenix:
(I got a bad feeling about this...)
Payne:
We have a witness that can prove he DID go to the victim's apartment that day!
Leads to:
"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"Judge:
Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?Payne:
The man who found the victim's body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw the defendant fleeing the scene of the crime!Judge:
Order! Order in the court! Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.Payne:
Yes, Your Honor.Phoenix:
(This is bad...)Payne:
On the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim's building. Please bring Mr. Frank Sahwit to the stand!Payne:
Mr. Sahwit, you sell newspaper subscriptions, is this correct?Sahwit:
Oh, oh yes! Newspapers, yes!Judge:
Mr. Sahwit, you may proceed with your testimony. Please tell the court what you saw on the day of the murder.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Sahwit:
I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.
I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.
Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.
Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!
I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.
I thought to call the police immediately!
However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.
I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.
I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.
The man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Judge:
Hmm...Phoenix:
(Larry! Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!)Judge:
Incidentally, why wasn't the phone in the victim's apartment working?Payne:
Your Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.Judge:
Aren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?Payne:
Yes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.Blackout Record added to the Court Record.Judge:
Now, Mr. Wright...Phoenix:
Yes! Er... yes, Your Honor?Judge:
You may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:
C-Cross-examination, Your Honor?Mia:
Alright, Wright, this is it. The real deal!Phoenix:
Uh... what exactly am I supposed to do?Mia:
Why, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!Phoenix:
Lies! What?! He was lying!?Mia:
Your client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?Phoenix:
!!! How do I prove he's not?Mia:
You hold the key! It's in the evidence! Compare the witness's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there! First, find contradictions between the Court Record and the witness's testimony. Then, once you've found the contradicting evidence... present it and rub it in the witness's face!Phoenix:
Um... okay.Mia:

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Isn't a man leaving an apartment a common sight? I find it odd you would take notice of him...
Sahwit:
Er... heh. I don't know. He just seemed strange to me, that's all. Like he was mad, and yet frightened at the same time. Just like... a criminal fleeing the scene of a crime!
Phoenix:
The defense requests that the witness refrain from conjecture!
Payne:
Of course. What the witness means is that the man he saw looked suspicious. So, what happened next?Sahwit:
I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Half-open... you say?
Sahwit:
Yes, yes, the door was open halfway. Yes. I watched for a moment, but no one came to close the door. "That's odd, in a big city like this," I thought...
Payne:
I see. And what happened next?Sahwit:
Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What gave you the idea to do that?
Sahwit:
Well, the door was half-open, you see. Isn't it only human to want to... peek? We climb mountains because they are there! It's the same thing.
Payne:
Truer words have never been spoken! Anyone would look inside!

Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Are you sure she was dead?
Sahwit:
W-Well, no, I guess I wasn't. But, she wasn't moving at all, and there was blood everywhere.

So, you didn't touch ANYTHING in the apartment?
Sahwit:
Um, yes. I mean no! Nothing.

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
You "thought" to call the police? Does that mean you didn't actually call them!?

Sahwit:
Yes. I mean, no. No, it wasn't. Right. (Changed from [Yes. I mean, no, no it wasn't. Right.] in the original release)
Phoenix:
But you said you didn't go into the apartment... or did you!?
Sahwit:
Oh, oh, that? I can explain that! There was a cordless phone on a shelf in the entranceway. I reached inside and tried using that to call...
Payne:
And the phone wasn't working, correct? What happened next?Sahwit:
I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Why use a public phone?
Sahwit:
Well, you see, I don't have a cell phone. And, being the middle of the afternoon, there was no answer at the nearby apartments.
Phoenix:
Ah, right... what time did you call again?Sahwit:
I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
1:00 PM! Are you certain?
Sahwit:
Yes. Absolutely.

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Are you absolutely, 100% positive?
Sahwit:
Yes, it was him. No mistake about it.
Payne:
The witness says he's certain!Mia:
That's all of it. There must be a contradiction in there somewhere. Examine the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab] if something strikes you as being suspicious. (Changed from [Examine the Court Record button if something strikes you as being suspicious.] in the original release) Then, find the evidence that contradicts his testimony, and present it to the court!Phoenix:
You found the body at 1:00 PM. You're sure?Sahwit:
Yes. It was 1:00 PM, for certain.Phoenix:
Frankly, I find that hard to believe! Your statement directly contradicts the autopsy report. The autopsy notes the time of death at sometime after 4PM. There was nobody to... er... no "body" to find at 1:00 PM! How do you explain this three-hour gap?Sahwit:
!!! Oh, that! Oh, er...Payne:Payne:
This is trivial! The witness merely forgot the time!Judge:
After his testimony, I find that hard to believe. Mr. Sahwit... Why were you so certain that you found the body at 1:00 PM?Sahwit:
I... er... well, I... Gee, that's a really good question!Mia:
Great job, Wright! Way to put him on the spot! That's all you have to do: point out contradictions! Lies always beget more lies! See through one, and their whole story falls apart!Sahwit:
Wait! I remember now!Judge:
Would you care to give your testimony again?Witness Testimony-- The Time of Discovery --Sahwit:
You see, when I found the body, I heard the time.
There was a voice saying the time... It was probably coming from the television.
Oh, but it was three hours off, wasn't it?
I guess the victim must have been watching a video of a taped program!
That's why I thought it was 1:00 PM!
Terribly sorry about the misunderstanding...Judge:
Hmm... I see. You heard a voice saying the time on a taped program. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Mia:

You said "heard"... Not "saw"?
Sahwit:
Yes, heard. All I saw was the body lying there... I didn't think to look at anything else, least of all my watch.
Phoenix:
Hmm... Isn't that a little strange? So you're saying you "heard" something. But if you were so shocked by the body, you wouldn't hear anything at all!
Payne:

Payne:
The witness did say he actually heard the time. It's ludicrous to suggest he "wouldn't hear anything"!

2025-01-22 14:42:39,089 - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-22 14:42:39,093 - INFO - Assistant reply: To find the contradiction in the witness Frank Sahwit's testimony, we must carefully analyze what he claims and check it against the evidence provided.

1. **Testimony Statement 1**: Actually, I didn't "hear" the time... I "saw" it!

2. **Testimony Statement 2**: There was a table clock in the apartment, wasn't there!

3. **Testimony Statement 3**: Yeah, the murder weapon! The killer used it to hit the victim!

4. **Testimony Statement 4**: That must have been what I saw.

Now, let's consider the relevant evidence:

- **Evidence 1**: Cindy's Autopsy Report - Indicates the cause of death was due to blunt trauma, but not specifically tied to a clock.
  
- **Evidence 2**: Statue (The Thinker) - Described as a heavy statue. During the trial, it was noted to be the murder weapon.

The key contradiction lies in the witness suggesting that the murder weapon was a table clock. From the evidence, we know that:

- The object used as the murder weapon is described specifically as a statue in the shape of "The Thinker." It is not identified as a clock, despite the witness's claim.

This contradiction shows that the witness's testimony is inconsistent with the established evidence. Therefore, the correct course of action is to present the statue evidence against the testimony statement related to the murder weapon being a clock.

I'll make it look like HE did it!August 3, 9:47 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2Phoenix:\n(Boy am I nervous!)Mia:\nWright!Phoenix:\nOh, h-hiya, Chief.Mia:\nWhew, I'm glad I made it on time. Well, I have to say Phoenix, I'm impressed! Not everyone takes on a murder trial right off the bat like this. It says a lot about you... and your client as well.Phoenix:\nUm... thanks. Actually, it's because I owe him a favor.Mia:\nA favor? You mean, you knew the defendant before this case?Phoenix:\nYes. Actually, I kind of owe my current job to him. He's one of the reasons I became an attorney.Mia:\nWell, that's news to me!Phoenix:\nI want to help him out any way I can! I just... really want to help him. I owe him that much.???:\n(It's over! My life, everything, it's all over!)Mia:\n... Is that your client screaming over there? (Changed from [Isn't that your client screaming over there?] in the original release)Phoenix:\nYeah... it's him. (Changed from [Yeah... that's him.] in the original release)???:\n(Death! Despair!

I can't live in a world without her! I can't! Who... who took her away from me, Nick? Who did this!? Aww, Nick, ya gotta tell me! Who took my baby away!?Phoenix:\n(Hmm... The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say it was you...)Phoenix:\nMy name is Phoenix Wright. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\" In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!August 3, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz. (Changed from [The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.] in the original release)Payne:\nThe prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:\nThe, um, defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:\nAhem.

Murder is a serious charge. For your client's sake, I hope you can control your nerves.Phoenix:\nThank... thank you, Your Honor.Judge:\n... Mr. Wright, given the circumstances... I think we should have a test to ascertain your readiness.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. (Gulp... Hands shaking... Eyesight... fading...)Judge:\nThis test will consist of a few simple questions. Answer them clearly and concisely. Please state the name of the defendant in this case.Phoenix Wright\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... the defendant... is me... right? (Changed from [Um... the defendant... is me, right?] in the original release)\nMia:\nWright! Have you completely lost your mind? Focus! The defendant is the person on trial! You're his lawyer!\nPhoenix:\nUm, er, eh? Oh yeah, right! Eh heh heh.\nMia:\nThis is no laughing matter! You did pass the bar, didn't you?\nJudge:\nSorry, I couldn't hear your answer.

(Changed from [Wright!] in the original release) The defendant is the one on trial--your client!

Well, that's Larry Butz, Your Honor.Judge:\nCorrect. Just keep your wits about you and you'll do fine. Next question: This is a murder trial. Tell me, what's the victim's name?Phoenix:\n(Whew, I know this one! Glad I read the case report cover to cover so many times. It's... wait... Uh-oh! No... no way! I forgot! I'm drawing a total blank here!)Mia:\nPhoenix! Are you absolutely SURE you're up to this? You don't even know the victim's name!?Phoenix:\nOh, the victim! O-Of course I know the victim's name! I, um, just forgot. ...Temporarily (Changed from [I, um, just forgot. ... Temporarily.] in the original release)Mia:\nI think I feel a migraine coming on.

Who is the victim in this case?\"Cinder Block\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOh, um, wasn't it Ms. Block? Ms. Cinder Block?\nJudge:\nThe person in question was a victim of murder, not ill-conceived naming, Mr. Wright.\nMia:\nWright?

Now, tell me, what was the cause of death? She died because she was...?Poisoned\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOh, right! Wasn't she, um, poisoned by er... poison?\nJudge:\nYou're asking me!?\nPhoenix:\nUm... Chief! Help me out!\nMia:\nCheck the court record. [The R Button / Tab]... remember? (Changed from [Check the court record. The Court Record button... remember?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Geez. Give a guy a break!)\nJudge:\nLet me ask again.\nLeads back to:\n\"She died because she was...?\"Hit with a blunt object\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n\"She was struck once, by a blunt object.\"Strangled\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nRight... she was strangled, wasn't she?\nMia:\nPlease tell me that was you talking to yourself.\nJudge:\nIf you wish to hang yourself, Mr. Wright, you're welcome to, but not inside my courtroom. I suppose there's nothing to do but give you another try:\nLeads back to:\n\"She died because she was...?\"Phoenix:\nShe was struck once, by a blunt object.Judge:\nCorrect. You've answered all my questions. I see no reason why we shouldn't proceed. You seem much more relaxed, Mr. Wright. Good for you.Phoenix:\nThank you, Your Honor. (Because I don't FEEL relaxed, that's for sure.)Judge:\nWell, then... First, a question for the prosecution. Mr. Payne?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nAs Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to the court just what that \"object\" was?Payne:\nThe murder weapon was this statue of \"The Thinker.\" It was found lying on the floor, next to the victim.Judge:\nI see... The court accepts it into evidence. (Changed from [I see... the court accepts it into evidence.] in the original release)Statue added to the Court Record.Mia:\nWright... Be sure to pay attention to any evidence added during the trial. That evidence is the only ammunition you have in court. [Touch the Court Record button / Use the R Button] to check the Court Record frequently.Judge:\nMr. Payne, the prosecution may call its first witness.Payne:\nThe prosecution calls the defendant, Mr. Butz, to the stand.Phoenix:\nUm, Chief, what do I do now?Mia:\nPay attention. You don't want to miss any information that might help your client's case. You'll get your chance to respond to the prosecution later, so be ready! Let's just hope he doesn't say anything... unfortunate.Phoenix:\n(Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... This could be bad.) (Changed from [Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... this could be bad.] in the original release)Payne:\nAhem. Mr. Butz. Is it not true that the victim had recently dumped you?Butz:\nHey, watch it buddy! We were great together!

WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?Payne:\nMr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by \"dumped.\" In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!Butz:\nWhaddya mean, \"one of them\"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!Payne:\nYour Honor, the victim's passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.Passport added to the Court Record.Judge:\nHmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.Butz:\nDude... no way...Payne:\nThe victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several \"Sugar Daddies.\"Butz:\nDaddies? Sugar?Payne:\nYes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.Butz:\nDuuude!Payne:\nWe can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?Mia:\nWright... I don't think you want him to answer that question.Phoenix:\n(Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)Wait and see what happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Might be better not to get involved in this one...)\nPayne:\nWell, Mr. Butz?\nButz:\nDude, no way!

That question is irrelevant to this case!\nPayne:\nOof! *wince*\nButz:\nDude! Nick! Whaddya mean, \"irrelevant\"!? That cheatin' she-dog!\nLeads to:\n\"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!\"Butz:\nI'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I'm going to get to the bottom of this!Judge:\nLet's continue with the trial, shall we?Payne:\nI believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.Judge:\nYes, quite.Phoenix:\n(Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)Payne:\nNext question! You went to the victim's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?Butz:\nGulp!Payne:\nWell, did you, or did you not?Butz:\nHeh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn't!Phoenix:\n(Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)Have him answer honestly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I know!

So, like, I didn't see her.\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nYour Honor, the defendant is lying.\nJudge:\nLying?\nPayne:\nThe prosecution would like to call a witness who can prove Mr. Butz is lying.\nLeads to:\n\"Well, that simplifies matters.

Well then, we'll just have to remind you!\nPhoenix:\n(I got a bad feeling about this...)\nPayne:\nWe have a witness that can prove he DID go to the victim's apartment that day!\nLeads to:\n\"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?\"Judge:\nWell, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?Payne:\nThe man who found the victim's body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw the defendant fleeing the scene of the crime!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.Payne:\nYes, Your Honor.Phoenix:\n(This is bad...)Payne:\nOn the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim's building.

A woman... not moving... dead!\nI quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.\nI thought to call the police immediately!\nHowever, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.\nI went to a nearby park and found a public phone.\nI remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.\nThe man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Judge:\nHmm...Phoenix:\n(Larry! Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!)Judge:\nIncidentally, why wasn't the phone in the victim's apartment working?Payne:\nYour Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.Judge:\nAren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.Blackout Record added to the Court Record.Judge:\nNow, Mr. Wright...Phoenix:\nYes! Er... yes, Your Honor?Judge:\nYou may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:\nC-Cross-examination, Your Honor?Mia:\nAlright, Wright, this is it. The real deal!Phoenix:\nUh... what exactly am I supposed to do?Mia:\nWhy, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!Phoenix:\nLies! What?! He was lying!?Mia:\nYour client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?Phoenix:\n!!! How do I prove he's not?Mia:\nYou hold the key! It's in the evidence! Compare the witness's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there! First, find contradictions between the Court Record and the witness's testimony. Then, once you've found the contradicting evidence... present it and rub it in the witness's face!Phoenix:\nUm... okay.Mia:\nOpen the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab], then point out contradictions in the testimony! (Changed from [Touch the Court Record button and point out contradictions in the testimony!] in the original release)Cross Examination"

Sahwit: "I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM."
Sahwit: "The man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there."
Question:

During the cross-examination, identify the contradiction in the witness's testimony by presenting the appropriate evidence at the correct statement.
In this example, the witness claims to remember the time exactly as 1:00 PM, but the Cindy's Autopsy Report records the time of death between 4 PM-5 PM. This discrepancy can be presented as evidence to contradict the witness's statement.

Answer:
{
  "action": "present",
  "testimony": 9,
  "evidence": 2
}You may now present evidence that is helpful in finding a contradiction in the testimony. To present evidence, answer the question with a JSON object in the format of {"action": "present", "testimony": <number of the testimony>, "evidence": <number of the evidence>}, for example {"action": "present", "testimony": 5, "evidence": 2}.
Note that the evidence, character, and testimony is listed from 0 to n-1, so your response should be 0-indexed.
Explain your reasoning step by step before providing the JSON object. 
 Conclude your answer with "Final Answer:" followed by the JSON object on a new line.
Do not write any things after the JSON and make sure you use "Final Answer:" followed by the JSON object.

(The strange girl dropped out cold. I left her lying on the office sofa. I went back to the chief where she lay under the window. Her body was still warm... I could feel it when I held her shoulder. Then, all too quickly, it began to fade... Until finally she was cold.)Phoenix:
Chief...Examine









Broken glass







Phoenix:
Some shards of glass are scattered on the floor. They seem to be the remains of a glass light stand.




Chair







Phoenix:
The chief's chair. A simple, functional design. Feels pretty good to sit in, too.




Mia Fey's body







Phoenix:
Chief... It's hard seeing her like this, but if there are any clues here... She was struck on the head with a blunt object. She probably died instantly. "The Thinker" lying next to her must have been the murder weapon.
The Thinker added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
Hmm... there are some glass shards near the chief's body. Must be pieces of the glass light stand lying broken in the back of the room.
Glass Shards added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
Nothing else that seems like a clue here... Hmm...? A piece of paper! It must have fallen from Mia's hand! What could it be?




Mia Fey's body (subsequent times)







Phoenix:
It's painful to look... but I have to, for Mia's sake. Looks like she was hit in the head with a blunt weapon. She probably died instantly.




"Maya" scrap of paper (after examining Mia Fey's body; before clearing all Talk options at Fey & Co. Law Offices)







Phoenix:
! A word is written in blood on this scrap of paper! "Maya"...? Did Mia write this? This piece of paper is a receipt from a department store, dated yesterday.
Receipt added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(I think that's enough snooping around for now. I'd better call the police... and find out what that girl was doing here.)

"The Thinker" statue







Phoenix:
It's encrusted with dried blood. How ironic that this became the murder weapon... again.




Window







Phoenix:
There's a large building right across from the office. The "Gatewater Hotel." A nice, luxurious place.




Bookshelf







Phoenix:
All the chief's important documents are packed in here. This is where she filed her case records and recent rulings.




Computer







Phoenix:
Surprisingly, the chief was never good with machines. About all she used this PC for was e-mail. She picked up this ancient model at some garage sale for practically nothing.




Desk







Phoenix:
A perfectly normal office desk. The chief had a very particular policy about office décor: "Spend big on stuff the clients use, but keep your own stuff simple."




Ledger book







Phoenix:
The Fey & Co. ledger book. Everything is written in the chief's ultra-neat handwriting. It's a small office, but it makes a good bit of money.




Corded phone







Phoenix:
Right! I'd better call the police! ...? That's funny... A few of the screws on the receiver are missing... It looks like someone was halfway through taking it apart.
???:
Police!? Please, come quick!
Phoenix:
(Wh-what was that!? Someone screaming from outside the window!?) ...! She's staring right at me! She's holding a phone in her hand...

Bookshelf







Phoenix:
You couldn't cram more legal books in here, even if you wanted to. Few can gaze upon the shelves without feeling insignificant.




Door







Phoenix:
The door to the chief's office. It's slightly open. I'd better not touch the door knob.




Painting







Phoenix:
A large painting. I guess you'd call this "modern art." I, on the other hand, call it a mistake.




Reception desk







Phoenix:
The reception desk. I usually sit here.




Sofa







Phoenix:
This sofa is for clients. It's leather... a real luxury model.




Writing desk







Phoenix:
A small writing desk cluttered with office supplies.Talk









What happened







Phoenix:
(She seems to be in shock. I don't want to disturb her, but I have to know...) Um... excuse me? Can you tell me what happened?
Maya:
... I came in... The room was dark. And Sis... Sis...!
Phoenix:
(So she was already dead.)




You and the Chief







Phoenix:
So, you're the chief's...?
Maya:
Sister. I'm her younger sister.
Phoenix:
And you were here... visiting? This late at night?
Maya:
Yes. She said she wanted me to keep some evidence for her.
Phoenix:
Evidence...?
Maya:
Yes... I-it was that clock... It was "The Thinker."Present









The Thinker







Phoenix:
Um, about "The Thinker"...
Maya:
! The Th-Thinker... That was... Oh, Sis! *sob*
Phoenix:
(Hmm, probably shouldn't have asked her about the murder weapon...)




Glass Shards







Phoenix:
This was lying next to the chief.
Maya:
I know. I saw it there too. I thought they might be pieces of the light stand.
Phoenix:
Hmm. Maybe. (Never heard of a glass light stand before...)




Receipt (before examining corded phone in Office)







Phoenix:
Before Mia died, she wrote a message with her own blood. She wrote it on the back of this receipt.
Maya:
! Th-th-that's MY name! W-why!? Why would she write my name?
Phoenix:
Please, just calm down.
Maya:
W-why would Sis write my name?
Phoenix:
(Uh-oh. Now I've done it... I'd better hurry up and call the police!)

W-what?Phoenix:
Mia's younger sister, Maya, was arrested on the spot. I was taken in for questioning and didn't get out until the next morning. My eyes were heavy... but I couldn't sleep. I sat around, waiting for visiting hours to begin at the detention center. I had to talk to Maya as soon as possible.September 6, 9:07 AMDetention CenterVisitor's RoomPhoenix:

Oh! It's you! The lawyer... G-good morning.Phoenix:
Good morning! (She looks so tired...)Maya:
Um... Are you going to be my attorney?Phoenix:
Well, that's what I wanted to talk to you about...It's up to you







Phoenix:
(I'd better give it to her straight...) It's up to you.
Maya:
Up... to me?
Phoenix:
Yes. I don't think this is something I should decide. After all, you're the one in trouble here.
Maya:
... They're never going to believe me... are they? Even you, when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it!
Leads to:
"Did I look at her like that?"Of course I will







Phoenix:
(First things first, I better get her cheered up...) Yeah, of course I will! Cheer up!
Maya:
R-really...?
Phoenix:
(Whoa! Did I say the wrong thing? She looks sadder now!) Um... what... what's wrong? You don't think I can do it?
Maya:
... No... no one could! Who would believe me? Even you, when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it!
Leads to:
"Did I look at her like that?"Sorry, not a chance







Phoenix:
(Maybe if I joke a bit she'll cheer up...) Hah hah! No way, Jose! Just kidding...

"Today was my junior partner's first time in court."Maya:
Wow! Really? How'd that go?Mia:
"It was quite the scene! Honestly, I was on edge the whole time. It's been a while..."Maya:
Hah! So, he crashed and burned?Mia:
"...He's a genius. One of those 'strike fear into the hearts of evil' types... The only thing he's lacking is... experience."Maya:
Huh, sounds like it was fun! Well, I know who to go to if I ever get into trouble now!Mia:
"I don't know, Maya. I think you might want to wait... give him three more years. That is, unless you want to be found guilty."Maya:
That's what she said!Phoenix:

Maya







Phoenix:
There's something I've been wanting to ask you...
Maya:
Yes?
Phoenix:
What's with that outfit?
Maya:
Oh, this? This is what all acolytes wear. It's my uniform, you could say.
Phoenix:
A-acolytes? Like people in religious training? What is it you do?
Maya:
Oh! It's nothing strange, really! I'm a spirit medium. ...In training.
Phoenix:
A s-spirit medium!? (I'm pretty sure that qualifies as strange.)




The day of the crime







Phoenix:
Could you tell me about the day of the murder?
Maya:
Yes! Let's see... that morning, I got a call from my sister. She wanted me to hold onto a piece of evidence for an upcoming trial.
Phoenix:
Evidence?
Maya:
Yes. That clock shaped like "The Thinker."
Phoenix:
(The one Larry made...) How could that have been evidence in a case?
Maya:
Um, right, she said something about that... ... I remember! Do you want to hear it in her own voice?
Phoenix:
H-her own voice!?
Maya:
Yes. I'm pretty sure our conversation is on my cell phone.
Phoenix:
You recorded it!
Maya:
Yeah! I forgot how to delete those things.




The day of the crime (after clearing "Your cell phone" Talk option)







Phoenix:
Could you tell me about the day of the murder? Sorry... I know it must be hard.
Maya:
No, it's okay. All I've been doing the last few hours is talking about it. I've kind of gotten used to it... Let's see... that morning, I got a call from my sister. She wanted me to hold onto a piece of evidence for an upcoming trial.
Phoenix:
(That's "The Thinker" clock that Larry made. It practically qualifies as a serial murderer by now.) So then, when did you arrive at the office?
Maya:
It was right around 9:00. The lights were off and... I could smell blood. Th-then I found her. My sister...
Phoenix:
Thanks, Maya. That's all I need to hear for now.




Your cell phone (appears after "The day of the crime")







Phoenix:
So, you say you have a conversation with your sister on your cell phone? Let's hear it!
Maya:
Right! Oh! I just remembered: that detective took my cell phone. Sorry.
Phoenix:
Oh, right. (Of course...) Next time I see Detective Gumshoe I'll ask him for it.

I'll write you a note so you don't forget, okay?

Spirit mediums (appears after "Maya")







Phoenix:
So you're an acolyte. A, er, medium-in-training.
Maya:
That's right. The Fey family, especially the women, have always been very sensitive to the spirit world.
Phoenix:
Wait a second, you said the "Fey Family"? So, Mia was into this stuff too?
Maya:
Of course! She left the mountain to "follow her career," she said. Her powers were first-class, too!
Phoenix:
(I... I had no idea.) Hmm... Wait...!
Maya:
What?
Phoenix:
So, you're a real, honest-to-goodness spirit medium? With E.S.P. and all that?
Maya:
Yes. ...In training.
Phoenix:
Well, can't you contact Mia's spirit, then? We can just ask her who killed her!

Phoenix:
So, Mia's death was instantaneous.
Gumshoe:
That's right, pal. She was... a beautiful person.
Phoenix:
You knew her, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Sure. All of us down at the precinct knew Ms. Fey. Much as it pains me to say this, she was a darn good lawyer. Hey, what are you looking at? I just got a little dust in my eye, that's all.




Maya







Phoenix:
Um, about Maya...
Gumshoe:
Yeah! I'm looking forward to the trial! Sorry, pal, but this is one trial you aren't going to win!
Phoenix:
W-why do you say that?
Gumshoe:
The city's put Prosecutor Edgeworth on the prosecution!
Phoenix:
(Edgeworth...)
Gumshoe:
I'm sure you know what that means, you being a lawyer and all.




Edgeworth (appears after "Maya")







Phoenix:
Prosecutor Edgeworth...
Gumshoe:
That's right, pal! Mr. Miles Edgeworth himself! Wait... you do know him, don't you!?



Of course I do!







Phoenix:
I know him. He's a feared prosecutor. He doesn't feel pain, he doesn't feel remorse. He won't stop until he gets his "guilty" verdict.
Gumshoe:
Aww, don't talk about him that way. You make him barely sound human! Still, I'm afraid this pretty much decides the case.
Phoenix:
(So, Edgeworth is on this one... He hasn't lost a case since he became prosecutor at the incredibly young age of 20. Of course, there are rumors of back-alley deals and forged evidence...)
Leads to:
"All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion."




Of course not!







Phoenix:
Never heard of him.
Gumshoe:
Whoa! And you call yourself a lawyer, pal!? About four years ago, this Edgeworth guy became a prosecutor at the age of 20! Everyone says he's a genius. Surprised you don't know him!
Phoenix:
(Of course I know him... I was just playing dumb. He's a cold, heartless machine who'll do anything to get a "guilty" verdict! There are rumors of back-alley deals and forged evidence...)

I was wondering, do you know anything about this?
Gumshoe:
That statue? That's the murder weapon.
Phoenix:
(Huh? He thinks the clock is just a statue, too... I'm starting to wish I'd never seen this thing.)




Glass Shards







Phoenix:
There was broken glass at the crime scene, right?
Gumshoe:
Hmm? Oh, that? Seems like a glass stand next to the victim fell over. The glass shards were pieces of the broken stand.




Receipt







Phoenix:
There was a piece of paper next to the victim, wasn't there?
Gumshoe:
Yeah. The one with the killer's name written on it!
Phoenix:
Are you sure that Mia wrote it herself?
Gumshoe:
Given the condition of the writing, it's hard to say if it's her handwriting or not.
Phoenix:
(So there's no proof that Mia wrote it.)




Maya's Memo







Phoenix:
I was wondering... did you see Maya Fey's cell phone?
Gumshoe:
Oh that? I have that.
Phoenix:
Do you think you could give it back?
Gumshoe:
Sure! I mean, wait a second, pal! Tricky lawyer!
Phoenix:
(Uh-oh, he's on to me!)



Tell him straight







Phoenix:
(Hmm... if I tell him why I want it there's no way he'll give it to me!)
Gumshoe:
Something the matter?
Phoenix:
Oh, no, it's just... You know, Detective!
Gumshoe:
Nope. I know nothing, pal!
Phoenix:
That cell phone has a lot of numbers on it... like her boyfriend's... A cell phone holds all a little girl's sweetest and spiciest secrets!
Gumshoe:
Urk? Y-you're trying to confuse me! Sorry, pal. I already checked all the numbers in memory!
Phoenix:
Impressive! You're quite the detective.
Gumshoe:
Uh huh. Oh, here, you can have the phone back. There weren't any suspicious call records in there, after all.

Tell him not-so-straight







Phoenix:

Gumshoe:
Something the matter?
Phoenix:
Oh, no, um... T-that carrying strap on the cell phone...
Gumshoe:
This? Hmm... it says "The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo"... "The Steel Samurai"... that action hero on TV?
Phoenix:
Yeah, you see that strap is a collector's item... She... was worried it might get lost if it went down to the precinct.
Gumshoe:
That what she said?
Phoenix:
Um. Yes.
Gumshoe:

Maya's Cell Phone received from Detective Gumshoe. (Changed from [Received: Maya's Cell Phone.] in the original release) Check the Court Record to hear the recorded conversation.




Mia's Autopsy Report







Phoenix:
Thanks for this!
Gumshoe:
Don't mention it, pal. When it comes to dealing with lawyers, "fight fair and square," is our motto!
Phoenix:
(I don't know how I feel, seeing everything written up like this... It makes Mia's death seem so... routine.)

Anything else







Gumshoe:
Hmm? What's that? Sorry, pal, but I got no info for the likes of you!After clearing "Mia" and "Maya" Talk options and presenting Maya's Memo:Phoenix:
(I guess I've asked all the questions I need to.)Gumshoe:
You all done, pal?Phoenix:
Um, yes, thank you. I'll be heading out now.Gumshoe:
Oh, wait. One more thing I wanted to mention to you. I don't suppose you're planning on talking to that witness. Anyway, you'd better not! No influencing the witness with your lawyerly ways, pal!Phoenix:
... (Come to think of it, I had completely forgotten about her...) The... witness?Gumshoe:
Yeah, Miss April May. I'm sorry 'bout this... But I can't tell you anything about her!Phoenix:
(Well, you just told me her name. Miss May, huh?) So you've sent her home already, then?Gumshoe:
Ahah! You're trying your lawyerly tricks on me now! She's not to go outside her room until the trial!Phoenix:
(So... she's still in the hotel across the way.) I guess I should know better than to try to get a detective to leak information.Gumshoe:
You got that right, pal!Phoenix:
(Time to pay a visit to Miss May!)September 6Grossberg Law OfficesPhoenix:
(According to the receptionist, the big boss is "out". She couldn't say when he'd be back. It must be hard to keep track of everything when you're a famous lawyer... Not to mention run an office like this. I guess I'll just have to come back later.)Examine









Bookshelf







Phoenix:
Expensive-looking mahogany bookshelves, filled with expensive-looking books. Hmm... funny... they don't look like they've ever been read.




Desk







Phoenix:
A solid mahogany desk. The wood's been polished to a deep luster.




Painting







Phoenix:
That painting has been bugging me ever since I stepped in here. The oil paint is so thick it's practically giving me a stuffed nose. I'm sure the price is nothing to sneeze at either, for that matter.




Potted plant







Phoenix:
An expensive potted plant. No idea what kind of plant it is, but it's probably the most expensive one available.




Table







Phoenix:
A table for clients. Hmm... an elegant ebony case, and if I'm not mistaken, that lighter's made of solid gold. Even I can tell someone here's got money to burn.Detention Center (after visitng Grossberg Law Offices, but before examining open drawer in Gatewater Hotel - Room 303)Maya:
Hey! What is it? Did you meet the lawyer?Phoenix:
Sorry. I haven't seen him yet.Maya:
I see...Phoenix:
(Hmm. I'd better go see if I can find this elite lawyer she's talking about.)Talk









Your family







Phoenix:
What about your family?
Maya:
I only had my sister. My father died when I was very young. And I don't know where my mother is.
Phoenix:
(Don't know...? So she could still be alive?)




Your mother (appears after "Your family")







Maya:
The women in my family have been mediums for generations. They say a lotta spiritual power runs in our blood. (Changed from [They say that E.S.P. runs in our blood.] in the original release) About fifteen years ago, our family was involved in an... incident. There was a man, and he... he... He ruined our mother's life.
Phoenix:
("Ruined"...?)
Maya:
After that, she disappeared. Several years after that, my sister announced she would "become a lawyer" and she left the mountain.
Phoenix:
... So, you live by yourself?
Maya:
Yes. I've gotten used to it. Oh, also... I had to become independent, or I would lose my powers! (Changed from [I had to become independent, or I would lose my E.S.P.!] in the original release)
Phoenix:
(I feel bad for her, all by herself up on that mountain...)




Your mother's enemy (appears after "Your mother")







Phoenix:
So, who was this man who, um, "ruined" your mother?
Maya:
About 15 years ago... there was an unusual murder case. It made quite a stir, everyone was talking about it, apparently. The police were running out of leads, and they were getting desperate...
Phoenix:
Wait... they didn't use a spirit medium, did they?
Maya:
The police convinced my mother to try to contact the victim.
Phoenix:
Wow... So, what happened?
Maya:
The case was solved... we thought.
Phoenix:
You "thought"...?
Maya:
The man my mother helped the police capture was innocent.
Phoenix:
...!
Maya:
The police's consultation with a medium had all been carried out in secret, of course. But... A man found out about it and leaked it to the press. He told all the papers that my mother was a fraud, and the media jumped on it big time. She... my mother... became the laughing stock of the nation.
Phoenix:
I see.
Maya:
... White...
Phoenix:
Excuse me? White?
Maya:
That was his name. My sister told me.
Phoenix:
White? Hmm...Present









Maya's Cell Phone







Phoenix:
Hey, I got your cell phone back.
Maya:
Oh! Say... Can I listen to my sister's voice?


Phoenix:
... (Maya's eyes closed... She listened to every word with such intensity... Before long, tears began to roll down her cheeks.) ...


Maya:
Thank you.September 6Gatewater Hotel - Room 303April:
Well! Hello there, handsome.Phoenix:
Umm... hi. (Smooth, Wright, real smooth.)April:
You're the lawyer, aren't you? The detective told me... He said, "Don't say nothing to that lawyer, pal!" Tee hee!Phoenix:
(Memo to self: thank Detective Gumshoe for making my job harder.)April:
Gee! This is all like something out of a movie! It's all so exciting I can hardly contain myself! Ooh! Let me go freshen up so I can look the part of the beautiful eyewitness!Phoenix:

Bed







Phoenix:
A simple bed. It's been recently made. Nothing eye-catching here.




Flowers







Phoenix:
The flowers are fake, as expected. I know sunflowers and tulips, but that's about the extent of my floral knowledge.




Open drawer







Leads to:
"(There's a screwdriver stuck in this drawer.)"




Painting







Phoenix:
Ah. A still-scene painting. Wait, should that be "still life"? Whatever. One of those is hanging on the wall.




Table







Phoenix:
A bottle and two glasses are on the table. Somebody must be staying with her.




Window







Phoenix:
The late summer sunlight streams through the window. There's the Fey & Co. Law Offices building, of course. You can see the inside of the room pretty clearly from here. I think it would be a little difficult to recognize a face from this distance, though.Phoenix:
(There's a screwdriver stuck in this drawer. I wonder what's inside? Let's take a look...)April:
Hey! H-h-hey!!! What are you doing!? No touching! Oooh. Bad boy! Y-you really shouldn't pry around in other people's rooms, now. You wouldn't want to make me upset, would you?Phoenix:

What you witnessed







Phoenix:
Do you think you could tell me something? I need you to describe what you observed at the time of the incident.
April:
Ooh. "Observe," "incident"! You sound just like a lawyer in the movies! I like a man with a big... vocabulary.
Phoenix:
(Umm... *gulp* Better not encourage her.) Er... you know that thing that occur... um... happened the other day? The bad thing? What did you see when it happened? I don't suppose you could tell me about it? Pretty please?
April:
Let me see... Um, well... Dream on! If you want to know, you'll just have to come to the court tomorrow, Mr. Lawyer!
Phoenix:
(Oh boy.)




Miss May







Phoenix:
Um, could you... just who exactly are you?
April:
Oooh, Mr. Lawyer! Are you hitting on me?
Phoenix:
N-n-no! Hey! I'm just doing my job here!
April:
Tee hee! You know, you're cute when you blush.
Phoenix:
(Believe me, this is the first time in my life I've blushed this much...) Umm... eh heh. Right... can you just tell me what it is you do?
April:
Well... No! Tee hee! And you had your little hopes up, didn't you!
Phoenix:
(Oh boy.)




This room







Phoenix:
I see there are two glasses on the table. Is someone staying here with you?
April:
Oooh! What amazing powers of observation! You must be one of those famous detectives, like on television!
Phoenix:
Oh, no, not me, I'm, er, just a lawyer!
April:
Say, Mr. Big Detective, why don't you go look for clues... in the garbage? Hmm? Miss May doesn't like nosey little lawyers... Hmph!
Phoenix:

A-cha-cha. I'm really quite busy here, son. I can't go taking cases on a day's notice! No, it's quite impossible.Phoenix:
W-wait a second! How did you know the trial was tomorrow!?Grossberg:

Your refusal







Phoenix:
How can you just refuse like that! Please, tell me why you won't take the case!
Grossberg:
Hmm? Eh, ahem! Well, you see it's just... I'm busy, you see!
Phoenix:
But the client is Mia Fey's sister!
Grossberg:
Hmm... ahem.
Phoenix:
Mia trusted you... She knew her sister would be in good hands.
Grossberg:
Yes, yes, of course I know that. However! I'm sorry but, I must refuse. Sorry. Good-bye.
Phoenix:
Creep. Fine. I don't have time to argue with you anyway. I'll go look elsewhere.
Grossberg:
*grumble*... Think not.
Phoenix:
Huh? Did you say something?
Grossberg:
I think not, I said.
Phoenix:
Wh-what do you mean?
Grossberg:
I'm terribly, terribly sorry. But I'm afraid that no lawyer worth their salt will take on this particular case. Terribly sorry, m'boy.
Phoenix:
Why!?
Grossberg:
I... I cannot say. ... I beg your pardon, but could you leave? Now? I've nothing more to discuss with you.
Phoenix:
(What's going on here!?)




Mia







Phoenix:
How did you know Mia Fey...?
Grossberg:
... She... worked here. A long time ago. Quite the apprentice, that one. Learned my techniques in the blink of an eye! She left one day, quite suddenly... She had a mission, you see.
Phoenix:
A "mission"?
Grossberg:
You could see it in her eyes. She followed it with a burning passion. Never looked back, that one.




That painting







Phoenix:
That's... quite a painting.
Grossberg:
Ahah! You noticed! It's my pride and joy! Impressive, isn't it? Well? ISN'T IT? The color of the sky! The hue of the sea! The weave of the straw hat! It's worth at least three million. I have no intention of parting with it, of course. No, I won't sell it! Not even to you!

Part 4September 7, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 1Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Ms. Maya Fey.Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor. (Miles Edgeworth... I'd better not show any signs of weakness today, or he'll be on me in an instant.)Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth. Please give the court your opening statement.Edgeworth:
Thank you, Your Honor. The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, was at the scene of the crime. The prosecution has evidence she committed this murder... and we have a witness who saw her do it. The prosecution sees no reason to doubt the facts of this case, Your Honor.Judge:
I see. Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Let's begin then.Edgeworth:
If we may call our first witness, Your Honor. (Changed from [You may call your first witness.] in the original release) The prosecution calls the chief officer at the scene, Detective Gumshoe!Edgeworth:
Witness, please state your name and profession to the court.Gumshoe:
Sir! My name's Dick Gumshoe, sir! I'm the detective in charge of homicides down at the precinct, sir!Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe. Please, describe for us the details of this murder.Gumshoe:
Very well, sir! Let me use this floor map of the office to explain. The body was found by this window, here.Edgeworth:
And the cause of death?Gumshoe:
Loss of blood due to being struck by a blunt object, sir! The murder weapon was a statue of "The Thinker" found next to the body, sir! It was heavy enough to be a deadly weapon, even in a girl's hands, sir!Judge:
The court accepts the statue as evidence.Phoenix:
(They're still calling it a "statue"...)Floor Plans added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:
Now, Detective...Gumshoe:
Y-yes sir!Edgeworth:
You immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey, who was found at the scene, correct? Can you tell me why?Gumshoe:
Yes sir! I had hard evidence she did it, sir!Judge:
Hmm. Detective Gumshoe. Please testify to the court about this "hard evidence."Witness Testimony-- Maya Fey's Arrest --Gumshoe:
As soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!
There were two people there already:
The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.
I immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey!
Why? We had a witness account describing her!
The witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder!Judge:
Hmm... The very moment, you say. Very well. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor. (Cross-examine what...? I couldn't see a single contradiction in that testimony...)...whoosh...SMACK!Phoenix:
(Hey! Maya just threw something at me... What's this? "When my sister couldn't find any contradictions in a witness's testimony she would bluff it and press the witness on every detail! The witness always slips up and says something wrong... It worked lots of times!" Heh... I should have expected Maya would know some of her sister's tricks! Alright. Let's give this a try!)Judge:
Something the matter?Phoenix:
No, Your Honor. I'd like to begin my cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Maya Fey's Arrest --Gumshoe:
As soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Who did you say you got a call from?
Gumshoe:
Hey pal, don't play dumb! You know who! The call was from a customer at the Gatewater Hotel, right across from the crime scene!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... okay, I pressed. Not sure it did much, though.) Right. Please continue.Gumshoe:
There were two people there already:Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe, how long would you say it took, between you receiving the call, and your arrival at the scene of the crime?
Gumshoe:
Hmm, right... I'd say it was about 3 minutes!
Phoenix:
Th-that's pretty fast!
Gumshoe:
Our motto this month is "quick response"! That's how I got there before the killer got away!
Edgeworth:
Indeed! So, tell us who the two people you found on the scene were.
Gumshoe:
Yes sir!Gumshoe:
The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Are you absolutely sure it was us?
Gumshoe:
Listen pal, your dumb act will only get you so far! With her funky hippie clothes and your spiky hair? You two stand out like... like suspicious people at a crime scene!
Phoenix:
(Well... he does have a point about her. She is pretty unmistakable. I should pick my points to press with a little more care...)Gumshoe:
I immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey!Press

Phoenix:
Why's that? What's your reason?Gumshoe:
Why? We had a witness account describing her!Press

Phoenix:

(I can't see a single contradiction in there! I'll just have to take Maya's advice and press him on anything suspicious!)Phoenix:
Hold on just one second!Gumshoe:
Y-yeah?Phoenix:
If I heard correctly... You said you arrested her because you had "hard evidence" she did it, correct?Gumshoe:
Huh? Did... did I say that? Me?Phoenix:
I heard you say it!Judge:
You did say it.Edgeworth:
You said it.Phoenix:
Exactly what about this suspicious woman in pink's claim was "hard evidence"!?Gumshoe:
Wh-what!? Miss May isn't suspicious, and she sure isn't pink, pal! W-well, I guess she is pink...Judge:
That's enough, Detective Gumshoe. Do you have any more solid proof other than her claims, Detective?Gumshoe:
Umm...Phoenix:
(Hmm! I guess pressing can have its advantages!)Gumshoe:
... Yes.Phoenix:
(Gah!)Gumshoe:
Sorry, I got the order of things mixed up in my testimony, Your Honor Sir! There was something I should have told you about first, Your Honor!Judge:
Very well, Detective. Let's hear your testimony again.Witness Testimony-- Hard Evidence --Gumshoe:
After securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.
I found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!
On it, the word "Maya" was written clearly in blood!
Lab test results showed that the blood was the victim's!
Also, there was blood found on the victim's finger!
Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!
How you like that? That's my "hard evidence"!Judge:
Hmm... Before we begin cross-examination, I have a question for you, Detective.Gumshoe:
Y-Your Honor?Judge:
Why didn't you testify about this vital piece of evidence the first time!?Gumshoe:
Ah... eh... I know. I'm real embarrassed I forgot about it, Your Honor Sir.Judge:
Try to be more careful! Very well, the defense may begin its cross-examination.Cross Examination

2025-01-22 14:42:48,266 - INFO - Assistant reply: To identify a contradiction in the testimony regarding the claim that the victim wrote the killer's name in blood, we need to examine the context and evidence provided.

1. **Testimony Detail**: Detective Gumshoe claims that before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name in her own blood on a piece of paper at the scene.

2. **Relevant Evidence**: 
   - The piece of paper mentioned in the evidence is a receipt dated the day before the murder, which would contradict the notion of it being a spontaneous and dying action if it's on the back of something unrelated.
   - Most importantly, Mia's Autopsy Report mentions that the death was instantaneous (at least originally), which would make it impossible for her to have written anything after being attacked.

3. **Conclusion**: The Autopsy Report is crucial here as it directly contradicts the testimony that the victim had time to write something before dying. If the death was indeed instantaneous, this testimony claiming Maya wrote the name lacks credibility.

**Final Answer**:

Well, I have to say Phoenix, I'm impressed! Not everyone takes on a murder trial right off the bat like this. It says a lot about you... and your client as well.Phoenix:\nUm... thanks. Actually, it's because I owe him a favor.Mia:\nA favor? You mean, you knew the defendant before this case?Phoenix:\nYes. Actually, I kind of owe my current job to him. He's one of the reasons I became an attorney.Mia:\nWell, that's news to me!Phoenix:\nI want to help him out any way I can! I just... really want to help him. I owe him that much.???:\n(It's over! My life, everything, it's all over!)Mia:\n... Is that your client screaming over there?

The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say it was you...)Phoenix:\nMy name is Phoenix Wright. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\" In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!August 3, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz. (Changed from [The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.] in the original release)Payne:\nThe prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:\nThe, um, defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:\nAhem.

Well, that's Larry Butz, Your Honor.Judge:\nCorrect. Just keep your wits about you and you'll do fine. Next question: This is a murder trial. Tell me, what's the victim's name?Phoenix:\n(Whew, I know this one! Glad I read the case report cover to cover so many times. It's... wait... Uh-oh! No... no way! I forgot! I'm drawing a total blank here!)Mia:\nPhoenix! Are you absolutely SURE you're up to this? You don't even know the victim's name!?Phoenix:\nOh, the victim! O-Of course I know the victim's name! I, um, just forgot. ...Temporarily (Changed from [I, um, just forgot. ... Temporarily.] in the original release)Mia:\nI think I feel a migraine coming on.

I suppose there's nothing to do but give you another try:\nLeads back to:\n\"She died because she was...?\"Phoenix:\nShe was struck once, by a blunt object.Judge:\nCorrect. You've answered all my questions. I see no reason why we shouldn't proceed. You seem much more relaxed, Mr. Wright. Good for you.Phoenix:\nThank you, Your Honor. (Because I don't FEEL relaxed, that's for sure.)Judge:\nWell, then... First, a question for the prosecution. Mr. Payne?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nAs Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to the court just what that \"object\" was?Payne:\nThe murder weapon was this statue of \"The Thinker.\" It was found lying on the floor, next to the victim.Judge:\nI see... The court accepts it into evidence. (Changed from [I see... the court accepts it into evidence.] in the original release)Statue added to the Court Record.Mia:\nWright... Be sure to pay attention to any evidence added during the trial. That evidence is the only ammunition you have in court. [Touch the Court Record button / Use the R Button] to check the Court Record frequently.Judge:\nMr. Payne, the prosecution may call its first witness.Payne:\nThe prosecution calls the defendant, Mr. Butz, to the stand.Phoenix:\nUm, Chief, what do I do now?Mia:\nPay attention. You don't want to miss any information that might help your client's case. You'll get your chance to respond to the prosecution later, so be ready!

WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?Payne:\nMr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by \"dumped.\" In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!Butz:\nWhaddya mean, \"one of them\"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!Payne:\nYour Honor, the victim's passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.Passport added to the Court Record.Judge:\nHmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.Butz:\nDude... no way...Payne:\nThe victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several \"Sugar Daddies.\"Butz:\nDaddies? Sugar?Payne:\nYes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.Butz:\nDuuude!Payne:\nWe can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?Mia:\nWright... I don't think you want him to answer that question.Phoenix:\n(Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)Wait and see what happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Might be better not to get involved in this one...)\nPayne:\nWell, Mr. Butz?\nButz:\nDude, no way!

That question is irrelevant to this case!\nPayne:\nOof! *wince*\nButz:\nDude! Nick! Whaddya mean, \"irrelevant\"!? That cheatin' she-dog!\nLeads to:\n\"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!\"Butz:\nI'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I'm going to get to the bottom of this!Judge:\nLet's continue with the trial, shall we?Payne:\nI believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.Judge:\nYes, quite.Phoenix:\n(Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)Payne:\nNext question! You went to the victim's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?Butz:\nGulp!Payne:\nWell, did you, or did you not?Butz:\nHeh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn't!Phoenix:\n(Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)Have him answer honestly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I know!

Who is your witness?\"Judge:\nWell, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?Payne:\nThe man who found the victim's body. Just before making the gruesome discovery...

Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.Payne:\nYes, Your Honor.Phoenix:\n(This is bad...)Payne:\nOn the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim's building.

Why didn't you tell the truth?

He was lying!?Mia:\nYour client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?Phoenix:\n!!! How do I prove he's not?Mia:\nYou hold the key! It's in the evidence! Compare the witness's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there! First, find contradictions between the Court Record and the witness's testimony.

Question:

During the cross-examination, identify the contradiction in the witness's testimony by presenting the appropriate evidence at the correct statement.
In this example, the witness claims to remember the time exactly as 1:00 PM, but the Cindy's Autopsy Report records the time of death between 4 PM-5 PM. This discrepancy can be presented as evidence to contradict the witness's statement.

Answer:
{
  "action": "present",
  "testimony": 9,
  "evidence": 2
}You may now present evidence that is helpful in finding a contradiction in the testimony. To present evidence, answer the question with a JSON object in the format of {"action": "present", "testimony": <number of the testimony>, "evidence": <number of the evidence>}, for example {"action": "present", "testimony": 5, "evidence": 2}.
Note that the evidence, character, and testimony is listed from 0 to n-1, so your response should be 0-indexed.
Explain your reasoning step by step before providing the JSON object. 
 Conclude your answer with "Final Answer:" followed by the JSON object on a new line.
Do not write any things after the JSON and make sure you use "Final Answer:" followed by the JSON object.

Uh oh, I'm late. Huh, that's strange. The chief must have gone home already. She said her sister was coming over so we should all go out for dinner... ... What's that smell...? Blood...? Mia! (Maybe she's in her office!)Examine









Anywhere







Phoenix:
I smell blood... and that can't be good! I have to check and see if Mia... the Chief's okay!Phoenix:
That smell... Blood!???:
... *sob* Sis...Phoenix:
(Someone's there!) ...! Chief? Chief...?Chief!!!Phoenix:
Who are you????:
...Phoenix:
(The strange girl dropped out cold. I left her lying on the office sofa. I went back to the chief where she lay under the window. Her body was still warm... I could feel it when I held her shoulder. Then, all too quickly, it began to fade... Until finally she was cold.)Phoenix:
Chief...Examine









Broken glass







Phoenix:
Some shards of glass are scattered on the floor. They seem to be the remains of a glass light stand.




Chair







Phoenix:
The chief's chair. A simple, functional design. Feels pretty good to sit in, too.




Mia Fey's body







Phoenix:
Chief... It's hard seeing her like this, but if there are any clues here... She was struck on the head with a blunt object. She probably died instantly. "The Thinker" lying next to her must have been the murder weapon.
The Thinker added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
Hmm... there are some glass shards near the chief's body. Must be pieces of the glass light stand lying broken in the back of the room.
Glass Shards added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
Nothing else that seems like a clue here... Hmm...? A piece of paper! It must have fallen from Mia's hand! What could it be?




Mia Fey's body (subsequent times)







Phoenix:
It's painful to look... but I have to, for Mia's sake. Looks like she was hit in the head with a blunt weapon. She probably died instantly.




"Maya" scrap of paper (after examining Mia Fey's body; before clearing all Talk options at Fey & Co. Law Offices)







Phoenix:
! A word is written in blood on this scrap of paper! "Maya"...? Did Mia write this? This piece of paper is a receipt from a department store, dated yesterday.
Receipt added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(I think that's enough snooping around for now. I'd better call the police... and find out what that girl was doing here.)

"The Thinker" statue







Phoenix:
It's encrusted with dried blood. How ironic that this became the murder weapon... again.




Window







Phoenix:
There's a large building right across from the office. The "Gatewater Hotel." A nice, luxurious place.




Bookshelf







Phoenix:
All the chief's important documents are packed in here. This is where she filed her case records and recent rulings.




Computer







Phoenix:
Surprisingly, the chief was never good with machines. About all she used this PC for was e-mail. She picked up this ancient model at some garage sale for practically nothing.




Desk







Phoenix:
A perfectly normal office desk. The chief had a very particular policy about office décor: "Spend big on stuff the clients use, but keep your own stuff simple."




Ledger book







Phoenix:
The Fey & Co. ledger book. Everything is written in the chief's ultra-neat handwriting. It's a small office, but it makes a good bit of money.




Corded phone







Phoenix:
Right! I'd better call the police! ...? That's funny... A few of the screws on the receiver are missing... It looks like someone was halfway through taking it apart.
???:
Police!? Please, come quick!
Phoenix:
(Wh-what was that!? Someone screaming from outside the window!?) ...! She's staring right at me! She's holding a phone in her hand...

Bookshelf







Phoenix:
You couldn't cram more legal books in here, even if you wanted to. Few can gaze upon the shelves without feeling insignificant.




Door







Phoenix:
The door to the chief's office. It's slightly open. I'd better not touch the door knob.




Painting







Phoenix:
A large painting. I guess you'd call this "modern art." I, on the other hand, call it a mistake.




Reception desk







Phoenix:
The reception desk. I usually sit here.




Sofa







Phoenix:
This sofa is for clients. It's leather... a real luxury model.




Writing desk







Phoenix:
A small writing desk cluttered with office supplies.Talk









What happened







Phoenix:
(She seems to be in shock. I don't want to disturb her, but I have to know...) Um... excuse me? Can you tell me what happened?
Maya:
... I came in... The room was dark. And Sis... Sis...!
Phoenix:
(So she was already dead.)




You and the Chief







Phoenix:
So, you're the chief's...?
Maya:
Sister. I'm her younger sister.
Phoenix:
And you were here... visiting? This late at night?
Maya:
Yes. She said she wanted me to keep some evidence for her.
Phoenix:
Evidence...?
Maya:
Yes... I-it was that clock... It was "The Thinker."Present









The Thinker







Phoenix:
Um, about "The Thinker"...
Maya:
! The Th-Thinker... That was... Oh, Sis! *sob*
Phoenix:
(Hmm, probably shouldn't have asked her about the murder weapon...)




Glass Shards







Phoenix:
This was lying next to the chief.
Maya:
I know. I saw it there too. I thought they might be pieces of the light stand.
Phoenix:
Hmm. Maybe. (Never heard of a glass light stand before...)




Receipt (before examining corded phone in Office)







Phoenix:
Before Mia died, she wrote a message with her own blood. She wrote it on the back of this receipt.
Maya:
! Th-th-that's MY name! W-why!? Why would she write my name?
Phoenix:
Please, just calm down.
Maya:
W-why would Sis write my name?
Phoenix:
(Uh-oh. Now I've done it... I'd better hurry up and call the police!)

W-what?Phoenix:
Mia's younger sister, Maya, was arrested on the spot. I was taken in for questioning and didn't get out until the next morning. My eyes were heavy... but I couldn't sleep. I sat around, waiting for visiting hours to begin at the detention center. I had to talk to Maya as soon as possible.September 6, 9:07 AMDetention CenterVisitor's RoomPhoenix:

Oh! It's you! The lawyer... G-good morning.Phoenix:
Good morning! (She looks so tired...)Maya:
Um... Are you going to be my attorney?Phoenix:
Well, that's what I wanted to talk to you about...It's up to you







Phoenix:
(I'd better give it to her straight...) It's up to you.
Maya:
Up... to me?
Phoenix:
Yes. I don't think this is something I should decide. After all, you're the one in trouble here.
Maya:
... They're never going to believe me... are they? Even you, when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it!
Leads to:
"Did I look at her like that?"Of course I will







Phoenix:
(First things first, I better get her cheered up...) Yeah, of course I will! Cheer up!
Maya:
R-really...?
Phoenix:
(Whoa! Did I say the wrong thing? She looks sadder now!) Um... what... what's wrong? You don't think I can do it?
Maya:
... No... no one could! Who would believe me? Even you, when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it!
Leads to:
"Did I look at her like that?"Sorry, not a chance







Phoenix:
(Maybe if I joke a bit she'll cheer up...) Hah hah! No way, Jose! Just kidding...

Wow! Really? How'd that go?Mia:
"It was quite the scene! Honestly, I was on edge the whole time. It's been a while..."Maya:
Hah! So, he crashed and burned?Mia:
"...He's a genius. One of those 'strike fear into the hearts of evil' types... The only thing he's lacking is... experience."Maya:
Huh, sounds like it was fun! Well, I know who to go to if I ever get into trouble now!Mia:
"I don't know, Maya. I think you might want to wait... give him three more years. That is, unless you want to be found guilty."Maya:
That's what she said!Phoenix:

Maya







Phoenix:
There's something I've been wanting to ask you...
Maya:
Yes?
Phoenix:
What's with that outfit?
Maya:
Oh, this? This is what all acolytes wear. It's my uniform, you could say.
Phoenix:
A-acolytes? Like people in religious training? What is it you do?
Maya:
Oh! It's nothing strange, really! I'm a spirit medium. ...In training.
Phoenix:
A s-spirit medium!? (I'm pretty sure that qualifies as strange.)




The day of the crime







Phoenix:
Could you tell me about the day of the murder?
Maya:
Yes! Let's see... that morning, I got a call from my sister. She wanted me to hold onto a piece of evidence for an upcoming trial.
Phoenix:
Evidence?
Maya:
Yes. That clock shaped like "The Thinker."
Phoenix:
(The one Larry made...) How could that have been evidence in a case?
Maya:
Um, right, she said something about that... ... I remember! Do you want to hear it in her own voice?
Phoenix:
H-her own voice!?
Maya:
Yes. I'm pretty sure our conversation is on my cell phone.
Phoenix:
You recorded it!
Maya:
Yeah! I forgot how to delete those things.




The day of the crime (after clearing "Your cell phone" Talk option)







Phoenix:
Could you tell me about the day of the murder? Sorry... I know it must be hard.
Maya:
No, it's okay. All I've been doing the last few hours is talking about it. I've kind of gotten used to it... Let's see... that morning, I got a call from my sister. She wanted me to hold onto a piece of evidence for an upcoming trial.
Phoenix:
(That's "The Thinker" clock that Larry made. It practically qualifies as a serial murderer by now.) So then, when did you arrive at the office?
Maya:
It was right around 9:00. The lights were off and... I could smell blood. Th-then I found her. My sister...
Phoenix:
Thanks, Maya. That's all I need to hear for now.




Your cell phone (appears after "The day of the crime")







Phoenix:
So, you say you have a conversation with your sister on your cell phone? Let's hear it!
Maya:
Right! Oh! I just remembered: that detective took my cell phone. Sorry.
Phoenix:
Oh, right. (Of course...) Next time I see Detective Gumshoe I'll ask him for it.
Maya:
I'll write you a note so you don't forget, okay?
Phoenix:
Sure, thanks.

Spirit mediums (appears after "Maya")







Phoenix:
So you're an acolyte. A, er, medium-in-training.
Maya:
That's right. The Fey family, especially the women, have always been very sensitive to the spirit world.
Phoenix:
Wait a second, you said the "Fey Family"? So, Mia was into this stuff too?
Maya:
Of course! She left the mountain to "follow her career," she said. Her powers were first-class, too!
Phoenix:
(I... I had no idea.) Hmm... Wait...!
Maya:
What?
Phoenix:
So, you're a real, honest-to-goodness spirit medium? With E.S.P. and all that?
Maya:
Yes. ...In training.
Phoenix:
Well, can't you contact Mia's spirit, then? We can just ask her who killed her!
Maya:
...! I-I'm sorry... I'm still in training. I couldn't do something on that level...

Phoenix:

Maya:
Y-you mean the one with my name on it?
Phoenix:
Any idea why she...
Maya:
Absolutely none! Um... Do you trust me?



I trust you

Huh? Something the matter?Maya:
Um... I was wondering, could I ask you a favor?Phoenix:

Phoenix:
About Ms. Fey... did you do an autopsy?
Gumshoe:
Hmm? You want to know the results, eh?
Phoenix:
...
Gumshoe:
Now don't you look at me like that, pal! It's no use! She might have been your boss, but that doesn't mean you get any special treatment. Alright, alright. You can see the report, but that's all!
Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.




Mia (subsequent times)







Phoenix:
So, Mia's death was instantaneous.
Gumshoe:
That's right, pal. She was... a beautiful person.
Phoenix:
You knew her, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Sure. All of us down at the precinct knew Ms. Fey. Much as it pains me to say this, she was a darn good lawyer. Hey, what are you looking at? I just got a little dust in my eye, that's all.




Maya







Phoenix:
Um, about Maya...
Gumshoe:
Yeah! I'm looking forward to the trial! Sorry, pal, but this is one trial you aren't going to win!
Phoenix:
W-why do you say that?
Gumshoe:
The city's put Prosecutor Edgeworth on the prosecution!
Phoenix:
(Edgeworth...)
Gumshoe:
I'm sure you know what that means, you being a lawyer and all.




Edgeworth (appears after "Maya")







Phoenix:
Prosecutor Edgeworth...
Gumshoe:
That's right, pal! Mr. Miles Edgeworth himself! Wait... you do know him, don't you!?



Of course I do!







Phoenix:
I know him. He's a feared prosecutor. He doesn't feel pain, he doesn't feel remorse. He won't stop until he gets his "guilty" verdict.
Gumshoe:
Aww, don't talk about him that way. You make him barely sound human! Still, I'm afraid this pretty much decides the case.
Phoenix:
(So, Edgeworth is on this one... He hasn't lost a case since he became prosecutor at the incredibly young age of 20. Of course, there are rumors of back-alley deals and forged evidence...)
Leads to:
"All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion."




Of course not!







Phoenix:
Never heard of him.
Gumshoe:
Whoa! And you call yourself a lawyer, pal!? About four years ago, this Edgeworth guy became a prosecutor at the age of 20! Everyone says he's a genius. Surprised you don't know him!
Phoenix:
(Of course I know him... I was just playing dumb. He's a cold, heartless machine who'll do anything to get a "guilty" verdict! There are rumors of back-alley deals and forged evidence...)

"All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion."

The Thinker







Phoenix:
I was wondering, do you know anything about this?
Gumshoe:
That statue? That's the murder weapon.
Phoenix:
(Huh? He thinks the clock is just a statue, too... I'm starting to wish I'd never seen this thing.)




Glass Shards







Phoenix:
There was broken glass at the crime scene, right?
Gumshoe:
Hmm? Oh, that? Seems like a glass stand next to the victim fell over. The glass shards were pieces of the broken stand.




Receipt







Phoenix:
There was a piece of paper next to the victim, wasn't there?
Gumshoe:
Yeah. The one with the killer's name written on it!
Phoenix:
Are you sure that Mia wrote it herself?
Gumshoe:
Given the condition of the writing, it's hard to say if it's her handwriting or not.
Phoenix:
(So there's no proof that Mia wrote it.)




Maya's Memo







Phoenix:
I was wondering... did you see Maya Fey's cell phone?
Gumshoe:
Oh that? I have that.
Phoenix:
Do you think you could give it back?
Gumshoe:
Sure! I mean, wait a second, pal! Tricky lawyer!
Phoenix:
(Uh-oh, he's on to me!)



Tell him straight







Phoenix:
(Hmm... if I tell him why I want it there's no way he'll give it to me!)
Gumshoe:
Something the matter?
Phoenix:
Oh, no, it's just... You know, Detective!
Gumshoe:
Nope. I know nothing, pal!
Phoenix:
That cell phone has a lot of numbers on it... like her boyfriend's... A cell phone holds all a little girl's sweetest and spiciest secrets!
Gumshoe:
Urk? Y-you're trying to confuse me! Sorry, pal. I already checked all the numbers in memory!
Phoenix:
Impressive! You're quite the detective.
Gumshoe:
Uh huh. Oh, here, you can have the phone back. There weren't any suspicious call records in there, after all.
Leads to:
"Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation..."




Tell him not-so-straight







Phoenix:
(Okay, I can't be straight with this guy... but what should I tell him?)
Gumshoe:
Something the matter?
Phoenix:
Oh, no, um... T-that carrying strap on the cell phone...
Gumshoe:
This? Hmm... it says "The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo"... "The Steel Samurai"... that action hero on TV?
Phoenix:
Yeah, you see that strap is a collector's item... She... was worried it might get lost if it went down to the precinct.
Gumshoe:
That what she said?
Phoenix:
Um. Yes.
Gumshoe:
... Okay, pal. I wrote down all the numbers she called anyway. Here you go.

"Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation..."


Phoenix:

Maya's Cell Phone received from Detective Gumshoe. (Changed from [Received: Maya's Cell Phone.] in the original release) Check the Court Record to hear the recorded conversation.




Mia's Autopsy Report







Phoenix:
Thanks for this!
Gumshoe:
Don't mention it, pal. When it comes to dealing with lawyers, "fight fair and square," is our motto!
Phoenix:
(I don't know how I feel, seeing everything written up like this... It makes Mia's death seem so... routine.)

Anything else







Gumshoe:
Hmm? What's that? Sorry, pal, but I got no info for the likes of you!After clearing "Mia" and "Maya" Talk options and presenting Maya's Memo:Phoenix:
(I guess I've asked all the questions I need to.)Gumshoe:
You all done, pal?Phoenix:
Um, yes, thank you. I'll be heading out now.Gumshoe:
Oh, wait. One more thing I wanted to mention to you. I don't suppose you're planning on talking to that witness. Anyway, you'd better not! No influencing the witness with your lawyerly ways, pal!Phoenix:
... (Come to think of it, I had completely forgotten about her...) The... witness?Gumshoe:
Yeah, Miss April May. I'm sorry 'bout this... But I can't tell you anything about her!Phoenix:
(Well, you just told me her name. Miss May, huh?) So you've sent her home already, then?Gumshoe:
Ahah! You're trying your lawyerly tricks on me now! She's not to go outside her room until the trial!Phoenix:
(So... she's still in the hotel across the way.) I guess I should know better than to try to get a detective to leak information.Gumshoe:
You got that right, pal!Phoenix:
(Time to pay a visit to Miss May!)September 6Grossberg Law OfficesPhoenix:
(According to the receptionist, the big boss is "out". She couldn't say when he'd be back. It must be hard to keep track of everything when you're a famous lawyer... Not to mention run an office like this. I guess I'll just have to come back later.)Examine









Bookshelf







Phoenix:
Expensive-looking mahogany bookshelves, filled with expensive-looking books. Hmm... funny... they don't look like they've ever been read.




Desk







Phoenix:
A solid mahogany desk. The wood's been polished to a deep luster.




Painting







Phoenix:
That painting has been bugging me ever since I stepped in here. The oil paint is so thick it's practically giving me a stuffed nose. I'm sure the price is nothing to sneeze at either, for that matter.




Potted plant







Phoenix:
An expensive potted plant. No idea what kind of plant it is, but it's probably the most expensive one available.




Table







Phoenix:
A table for clients. Hmm... an elegant ebony case, and if I'm not mistaken, that lighter's made of solid gold. Even I can tell someone here's got money to burn.Detention Center (after visitng Grossberg Law Offices, but before examining open drawer in Gatewater Hotel - Room 303)Maya:
Hey! What is it? Did you meet the lawyer?Phoenix:
Sorry. I haven't seen him yet.Maya:
I see...Phoenix:
(Hmm. I'd better go see if I can find this elite lawyer she's talking about.)Talk









Your family







Phoenix:
What about your family?
Maya:
I only had my sister. My father died when I was very young. And I don't know where my mother is.
Phoenix:
(Don't know...? So she could still be alive?)




Your mother (appears after "Your family")







Maya:
The women in my family have been mediums for generations. They say a lotta spiritual power runs in our blood. (Changed from [They say that E.S.P. runs in our blood.] in the original release) About fifteen years ago, our family was involved in an... incident. There was a man, and he... he... He ruined our mother's life.
Phoenix:
("Ruined"...?)
Maya:
After that, she disappeared. Several years after that, my sister announced she would "become a lawyer" and she left the mountain.
Phoenix:
... So, you live by yourself?
Maya:
Yes. I've gotten used to it. Oh, also... I had to become independent, or I would lose my powers! (Changed from [I had to become independent, or I would lose my E.S.P.!] in the original release)
Phoenix:
(I feel bad for her, all by herself up on that mountain...)




Your mother's enemy (appears after "Your mother")







Phoenix:
So, who was this man who, um, "ruined" your mother?
Maya:
About 15 years ago... there was an unusual murder case. It made quite a stir, everyone was talking about it, apparently. The police were running out of leads, and they were getting desperate...
Phoenix:
Wait... they didn't use a spirit medium, did they?
Maya:
The police convinced my mother to try to contact the victim.
Phoenix:
Wow... So, what happened?
Maya:
The case was solved... we thought.
Phoenix:
You "thought"...?
Maya:
The man my mother helped the police capture was innocent.
Phoenix:
...!
Maya:
The police's consultation with a medium had all been carried out in secret, of course. But... A man found out about it and leaked it to the press. He told all the papers that my mother was a fraud, and the media jumped on it big time. She... my mother... became the laughing stock of the nation.
Phoenix:
I see.
Maya:
... White...
Phoenix:
Excuse me? White?
Maya:
That was his name. My sister told me.
Phoenix:
White? Hmm...Present









Maya's Cell Phone







Phoenix:
Hey, I got your cell phone back.
Maya:
Oh! Say... Can I listen to my sister's voice?


Phoenix:
... (Maya's eyes closed... She listened to every word with such intensity... Before long, tears began to roll down her cheeks.) ...


Maya:
Thank you.September 6Gatewater Hotel - Room 303April:
Well! Hello there, handsome.Phoenix:
Umm... hi. (Smooth, Wright, real smooth.)April:
You're the lawyer, aren't you? The detective told me... He said, "Don't say nothing to that lawyer, pal!" Tee hee!Phoenix:
(Memo to self: thank Detective Gumshoe for making my job harder.)April:
Gee! This is all like something out of a movie! It's all so exciting I can hardly contain myself! Ooh! Let me go freshen up so I can look the part of the beautiful eyewitness!Phoenix:

Bed







Phoenix:
A simple bed. It's been recently made. Nothing eye-catching here.




Flowers







Phoenix:
The flowers are fake, as expected. I know sunflowers and tulips, but that's about the extent of my floral knowledge.




Open drawer







Leads to:
"(There's a screwdriver stuck in this drawer.)"




Painting







Phoenix:
Ah. A still-scene painting. Wait, should that be "still life"? Whatever. One of those is hanging on the wall.




Table







Phoenix:
A bottle and two glasses are on the table. Somebody must be staying with her.




Window







Phoenix:
The late summer sunlight streams through the window. There's the Fey & Co. Law Offices building, of course. You can see the inside of the room pretty clearly from here. I think it would be a little difficult to recognize a face from this distance, though.Phoenix:
(There's a screwdriver stuck in this drawer. I wonder what's inside? Let's take a look...)April:
Hey! H-h-hey!!! What are you doing!? No touching! Oooh. Bad boy! Y-you really shouldn't pry around in other people's rooms, now. You wouldn't want to make me upset, would you?Phoenix:

What you witnessed







Phoenix:
Do you think you could tell me something? I need you to describe what you observed at the time of the incident.
April:
Ooh. "Observe," "incident"! You sound just like a lawyer in the movies! I like a man with a big... vocabulary.
Phoenix:
(Umm... *gulp* Better not encourage her.) Er... you know that thing that occur... um... happened the other day? The bad thing? What did you see when it happened? I don't suppose you could tell me about it? Pretty please?
April:
Let me see... Um, well... Dream on! If you want to know, you'll just have to come to the court tomorrow, Mr. Lawyer!
Phoenix:
(Oh boy.)




Miss May







Phoenix:
Um, could you... just who exactly are you?
April:
Oooh, Mr. Lawyer! Are you hitting on me?
Phoenix:
N-n-no! Hey! I'm just doing my job here!
April:
Tee hee! You know, you're cute when you blush.
Phoenix:
(Believe me, this is the first time in my life I've blushed this much...) Umm... eh heh. Right... can you just tell me what it is you do?
April:
Well... No! Tee hee! And you had your little hopes up, didn't you!
Phoenix:
(Oh boy.)




This room







Phoenix:
I see there are two glasses on the table. Is someone staying here with you?
April:
Oooh! What amazing powers of observation! You must be one of those famous detectives, like on television!
Phoenix:
Oh, no, not me, I'm, er, just a lawyer!
April:
Say, Mr. Big Detective, why don't you go look for clues... in the garbage? Hmm? Miss May doesn't like nosey little lawyers... Hmph!
Phoenix:
(Oh boy.)Present

Ah hah! So, you're the one they say has been looking for me?Phoenix:

Hmm...? That badge on your collar...? Ah, so you're a lawyer, are you now?Phoenix:
Y-yes, well... yes.Grossberg:
And what do you want? I'm not particularly busy these days... Please, proceed!Phoenix:

Hmm? Something the matter? You came to see the one-and-only Marvin Grossberg, did you not? Well, here I am, boy! What do you want? Out with it!Phoenix:
Um... w-well, sir, actually it's about Maya. Maya Fey.Grossberg:
...! Ah... yes. Maya Fey. Go on.Phoenix:
(Hmm? Why the strange reaction?)Grossberg:
A-cha-cha. I'm really quite busy here, son. I can't go taking cases on a day's notice! No, it's quite impossible.Phoenix:
W-wait a second! How did you know the trial was tomorrow!?Grossberg:
Urk? Ahem! A-anyway... I'm afraid it's entirely impossible for me to represent her. Sorry. End of discussion.Phoenix:

Your refusal







Phoenix:
How can you just refuse like that! Please, tell me why you won't take the case!
Grossberg:
Hmm? Eh, ahem! Well, you see it's just... I'm busy, you see!
Phoenix:
But the client is Mia Fey's sister!
Grossberg:
Hmm... ahem.
Phoenix:
Mia trusted you... She knew her sister would be in good hands.
Grossberg:
Yes, yes, of course I know that. However! I'm sorry but, I must refuse. Sorry. Good-bye.
Phoenix:
Creep. Fine. I don't have time to argue with you anyway. I'll go look elsewhere.
Grossberg:
*grumble*... Think not.
Phoenix:
Huh? Did you say something?
Grossberg:
I think not, I said.
Phoenix:
Wh-what do you mean?
Grossberg:
I'm terribly, terribly sorry. But I'm afraid that no lawyer worth their salt will take on this particular case. Terribly sorry, m'boy.
Phoenix:
Why!?
Grossberg:
I... I cannot say. ... I beg your pardon, but could you leave? Now? I've nothing more to discuss with you.
Phoenix:
(What's going on here!?)




Mia







Phoenix:
How did you know Mia Fey...?
Grossberg:
... She... worked here. A long time ago. Quite the apprentice, that one. Learned my techniques in the blink of an eye! She left one day, quite suddenly... She had a mission, you see.
Phoenix:
A "mission"?
Grossberg:
You could see it in her eyes. She followed it with a burning passion. Never looked back, that one.




That painting







Phoenix:
That's... quite a painting.
Grossberg:
Ahah! You noticed! It's my pride and joy! Impressive, isn't it? Well? ISN'T IT? The color of the sky! The hue of the sea! The weave of the straw hat! It's worth at least three million. I have no intention of parting with it, of course. No, I won't sell it! Not even to you!

Part 4September 7, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 1Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Ms. Maya Fey.Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor. (Miles Edgeworth... I'd better not show any signs of weakness today, or he'll be on me in an instant.)Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth. Please give the court your opening statement.Edgeworth:
Thank you, Your Honor. The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, was at the scene of the crime. The prosecution has evidence she committed this murder... and we have a witness who saw her do it. The prosecution sees no reason to doubt the facts of this case, Your Honor.Judge:
I see. Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Let's begin then.Edgeworth:
If we may call our first witness, Your Honor. (Changed from [You may call your first witness.] in the original release) The prosecution calls the chief officer at the scene, Detective Gumshoe!Edgeworth:
Witness, please state your name and profession to the court.Gumshoe:
Sir! My name's Dick Gumshoe, sir! I'm the detective in charge of homicides down at the precinct, sir!Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe. Please, describe for us the details of this murder.Gumshoe:
Very well, sir! Let me use this floor map of the office to explain. The body was found by this window, here.Edgeworth:
And the cause of death?Gumshoe:
Loss of blood due to being struck by a blunt object, sir! The murder weapon was a statue of "The Thinker" found next to the body, sir! It was heavy enough to be a deadly weapon, even in a girl's hands, sir!Judge:
The court accepts the statue as evidence.Phoenix:
(They're still calling it a "statue"...)Floor Plans added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:
Now, Detective...Gumshoe:
Y-yes sir!Edgeworth:
You immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey, who was found at the scene, correct? Can you tell me why?Gumshoe:
Yes sir! I had hard evidence she did it, sir!Judge:
Hmm. Detective Gumshoe. Please testify to the court about this "hard evidence."Witness Testimony-- Maya Fey's Arrest --Gumshoe:
As soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!
There were two people there already:
The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.
I immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey!
Why? We had a witness account describing her!
The witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder!Judge:
Hmm... The very moment, you say. Very well. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor. (Cross-examine what...? I couldn't see a single contradiction in that testimony...)...whoosh...SMACK!Phoenix:
(Hey! Maya just threw something at me... What's this? "When my sister couldn't find any contradictions in a witness's testimony she would bluff it and press the witness on every detail! The witness always slips up and says something wrong... It worked lots of times!" Heh... I should have expected Maya would know some of her sister's tricks! Alright. Let's give this a try!)Judge:
Something the matter?Phoenix:
No, Your Honor. I'd like to begin my cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Maya Fey's Arrest --Gumshoe:
As soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Who did you say you got a call from?
Gumshoe:
Hey pal, don't play dumb! You know who! The call was from a customer at the Gatewater Hotel, right across from the crime scene!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... okay, I pressed. Not sure it did much, though.) Right. Please continue.Gumshoe:
There were two people there already:Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe, how long would you say it took, between you receiving the call, and your arrival at the scene of the crime?
Gumshoe:
Hmm, right... I'd say it was about 3 minutes!
Phoenix:
Th-that's pretty fast!
Gumshoe:
Our motto this month is "quick response"! That's how I got there before the killer got away!
Edgeworth:
Indeed! So, tell us who the two people you found on the scene were.
Gumshoe:
Yes sir!Gumshoe:
The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Are you absolutely sure it was us?
Gumshoe:
Listen pal, your dumb act will only get you so far! With her funky hippie clothes and your spiky hair? You two stand out like... like suspicious people at a crime scene!
Phoenix:
(Well... he does have a point about her. She is pretty unmistakable. I should pick my points to press with a little more care...)Gumshoe:

(I can't see a single contradiction in there! I'll just have to take Maya's advice and press him on anything suspicious!)Phoenix:
Hold on just one second!Gumshoe:
Y-yeah?Phoenix:
If I heard correctly... You said you arrested her because you had "hard evidence" she did it, correct?Gumshoe:
Huh? Did... did I say that? Me?Phoenix:
I heard you say it!Judge:
You did say it.Edgeworth:
You said it.Phoenix:
Exactly what about this suspicious woman in pink's claim was "hard evidence"!?Gumshoe:
Wh-what!? Miss May isn't suspicious, and she sure isn't pink, pal! W-well, I guess she is pink...Judge:
That's enough, Detective Gumshoe. Do you have any more solid proof other than her claims, Detective?Gumshoe:
Umm...Phoenix:
(Hmm! I guess pressing can have its advantages!)Gumshoe:
... Yes.Phoenix:
(Gah!)Gumshoe:
Sorry, I got the order of things mixed up in my testimony, Your Honor Sir! There was something I should have told you about first, Your Honor!Judge:
Very well, Detective. Let's hear your testimony again.Witness Testimony-- Hard Evidence --Gumshoe:
After securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.
I found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!
On it, the word "Maya" was written clearly in blood!
Lab test results showed that the blood was the victim's!
Also, there was blood found on the victim's finger!
Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!
How you like that? That's my "hard evidence"!Judge:
Hmm... Before we begin cross-examination, I have a question for you, Detective.Gumshoe:
Y-Your Honor?Judge:
Why didn't you testify about this vital piece of evidence the first time!?Gumshoe:
Ah... eh... I know. I'm real embarrassed I forgot about it, Your Honor Sir.Judge:
Try to be more careful! Very well, the defense may begin its cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Hard Evidence --Gumshoe:
After securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
And did you find any evidence?
Gumshoe:
Now, now, don't jump the gun on me, pal. Just listen. I'm getting to the good part!
Phoenix:
(I got a bad feeling about this...)Gumshoe:
I found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Just because you found it next to the body doesn't mean the victim wrote it!
Gumshoe:
Ho hoh! Then who did write it, smarty-pants?
Phoenix:
Wh-who? Um...



The killer







Phoenix:
Th-the killer! Anyone can see that!
Gumshoe:
Hoh. You're saying the killer wrote her OWN name!? Buddy, please!
Phoenix:
She was framed!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Hold on. If that's the case, where's your evidence?
Phoenix:
Ah... (Urk!)
Edgeworth:
Hah! I guess that was a bit of a tall order for you. Those without evidence shouldn't open their mouths, Mr. Wright.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, pal!
Phoenix:
(Argh...!)
Leads to:
"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found."




Miss May







Phoenix:
Well... it could have been the witness, Miss May!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Hold on. The witness was in her hotel room, not the office. Try pulling the other leg, Mr. Wright!
Gumshoe:
Yeah, and while you're at it, pull mine too, pal!
Phoenix:
(Argh...!)
Leads to:
"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found."




I did







Phoenix:
It... it could have been me!
Gumshoe:
What! S-so it was you!
Phoenix:
No, no, no, I'm just saying it COULD have been me! Can you prove it wasn't?
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Hold on. So, you admit to this? You admit that you wrote the note?
Phoenix:
Uh...

Listen to me, Mr. Wright. This is a court of law, and I expect you to refrain from making thoughtless statements! Amateur!

Huh? What kind? Umm... well... I hear they take the, um, little bits in the blood, the... er... hemo... hemogl... Hermo... goblins... hobgob... Er...? Herma-goblin bobbin... I-I refuse to testify on this matter, sir! I'm no expert on blood tests!

Yes, that was quite clear. You may continue with your testimony.

Detective Gumshoe! Do you get a lot of cases where the victim actually writes the killer's name?

Sure! It happens all the time in books and the movies!
Phoenix:
This isn't a movie, Detective.
Gumshoe:
Oof!
Phoenix:
Let's talk about reality, shall we?
Gumshoe:
Umm... I guess, I haven't heard of many cases... no.
Phoenix:
Don't you find it a little odd that the victim would write down a name? Especially the name of her own sister?
Gumshoe:
Ah, yeah, actually, you got a point, pal.
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Stop right there. The witness's opinion on the matter is irrelevant! The facts are clear: the victim wrote down the name of the accused... The victim told us the name of her killer!

Phoenix:

"Detective Gumshoe!"Phoenix:
(That's his whole testimony... Okay, there has to be a contradiction in there somewhere. Let's find it!)Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe! There's one thing I want you to clarify for me here. You say that the victim, Mia Fey, wrote this note. That she was accusing the defendant, Maya Fey? That's really what you're saying?Gumshoe:
Wh-what? This isn't one of those lawyer tricks, now, is it? Of course she wrote it! Who else could have!?Phoenix:
You have it backwards, Detective.Gumshoe:
B-backwards?Phoenix:
The victim is the only person who absolutely could NOT have written it! This is a report from your department, Detective. "Immediate death due to a blow from a blunt object." She died immediately!Gumshoe:
But...!Phoenix:
No "but"-ing your way out of this one, Detective!Judge:
Order! Order! The defense has a point. Someone who died immediately wouldn't have the time to write anything down.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright. I beg your pardon, but when exactly did you obtain that autopsy report?Phoenix:
Wh-when...!?The day of the murder







Phoenix:
I... I'm pretty sure it was the day of the murder.
Gumshoe:
You're wrong there, pal! We didn't write an autopsy report 'til the day after!
Phoenix:
Oh. Right.

It was the day after the murder...

"The prosecution's point being...?"I forget







Phoenix:
I'm... sorry, I forgot.
Edgeworth:
Hah! Forgot, you say?
Gumshoe:
It was the day after the murder, Your Honor Sir. I was the one who handed it to him myself! Personally!
Phoenix:
Oh. R-right.
Leads to:
"The prosecution's point being...?"Judge:
The prosecution's point being...?Edgeworth:
That autopsy report is outdated, Your Honor.Phoenix:
Wh-what!?Edgeworth:
A second autopsy was performed yesterday, at my request! "Death was almost immediate due to a blow from a blunt object... But there is a possibility the victim lived for several minutes after the blow." I received these results this morning.Phoenix:
N-no way!Edgeworth:
Your Honor! It's quite easy to imagine that the victim did have time to write "Maya"! That is all.Judge:
I see!Phoenix:
(Damn you, Edgeworth! I should have known you'd have something up your sleeve!)Edgeworth:
Why, Mr. Wright, you look shocked! Something you want to say?You're a sham, Edgeworth!







Phoenix:
Mr. Edgeworth... I've heard there's nothing you won't do to get your verdict... What reason could you possibly have had to request a second autopsy report?
Judge:
Mr. Wright! The defense will refrain from personal attacks on the prosecution!
Edgeworth:
No matter, Your Honor... Mr. Wright. Say what you will, the evidence in this report is undeniable.
Leads to:
"Your Honor, I submit this report to the court."The detective's a sham!







Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe! You're a sham! How could you give me a faulty report!?
Gumshoe:
Huh? I-I thought...
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe.
Gumshoe:
Urp!
Edgeworth:
I'm disappointed in you, handing him the wrong report like that.
Gumshoe:
Eh...? I... I'm sorry, sir.
Edgeworth:
You are at fault, Detective. This isn't going to look good on your evaluation next month.
Gumshoe:
W-what? B-but... *sigh*

U-understood. The court accepts the evidence.Autopsy Report updated in the Court Record.Edgeworth:
Well, Your Honor? The evidence strongly suggests the victim was identifying the killer.Judge:
I suppose that's the obvious conclusion, yes.Phoenix:
(Darn! This isn't good!)Edgeworth:
The prosecution would like to call its next witness. This poor, innocent girl saw the murder with her own eyes!Judge:
Let the witness Miss April May take the stand.Phoenix:
(Exactly what part of her is "innocent"...?)Edgeworth:
Witness, your name, please.April:
April May! At your service! *wink*Judge:
Order! An introduction should not require any reaction from the crowd! The witness will refrain from wanton winking! ([wanton] misspelled as [wonton] in the original release)April:
Aww... Yes, Your Honor.Phoenix:
(This is not good... She's already captured the heart of every man in the court!)Edgeworth:
Tell us, where were you on the night of September 5, when the murder occurred?April:
Um... gee... I was, like, in my hotel room? Tee hee. I checked in right after lunch.Edgeworth:
And this hotel is directly across from the Fey & Co. Law Offices?April:
Mmm... that's right, big boy.Judge:
Please testify to the court about what you saw.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --April:
It was, like, 9:00 at night. I looked out the window, y'know!
And then, oooh! I saw a woman with long hair being attacked!
The one attacking her was the mousey girl sitting in the defendant's chair!
Then the woman, like, dodged to one side and ran away!
But that girl, she caught up to her and... and... She hit her!
Then the woman with long hair...
She kinda... slumped.
The end. That's all I saw. Every little bitsy witsy! *wink*Judge:
Hmm...Edgeworth:
Well, Your Honor?Judge:
I see. It is a remarkably solid testimony. I don't see a need to trouble the witness any...Phoenix:
W-wait, Your Honor!Judge:
Yes, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:
What about my cross-examination!?Judge:
I thought the witness's testimony just now was quite... firm. Didn't you?Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright... I understand you were Ms. Mia Fey's understudy, were you not? You must know her techniques well. Her cowardly way of finding tiny faults in perfectly good testimonies...Phoenix:
H-hey! How dare you!Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? Will you cross-examine the witness?Yes, I'm doing it







Phoenix:
I'll gladly proceed with the cross-examination. (If only because I have a feeling Edgeworth doesn't want me to! She has to have some weakness!)
Leads to:
"Very well, you may begin your cross-examination!"No thanks







Phoenix:
No... you're right. I guess there wouldn't be much point.
Edgeworth:
Heh heh heh. I'm glad you saw the error of your ways so soon! Your Honor. The prosecution rests its case!
Phoenix:
(Wh-what? That's it!?)
Judge:
Very well.
Phoenix:
W-wait! Hold on!
Judge:
Yes, Mr. Wright? Changed your mind? Will you cross-examine the witness?
Phoenix:
Yes yes yes! (I'd better, or I'll lose on the spot!)

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Why did you do that?
April:
Huh? "Why"? Like, why what?
Phoenix:
Why did you look out the window? Were you expecting to see something?
April:
Oh, well, um... gee!
Phoenix:
(What? That's it? She can't get out of this question that easily!)
April:
I sort of, y'know. I had a feeling!
Phoenix:
(Well, I have a feeling she's trying to avoid the question! Maybe I should press a little harder on this one?)



Go for it







Phoenix:
(Let's see how far I can run with this...) Surely, you must have had a reason to look out your window at that time of night!
April:
I... oooh!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright! I will not have you badgering my witness!
Phoenix:
B-badgering?
Edgeworth:
You insist on needling her with these trivial questions. I really don't think it should be allowed.
(Yeah! Yeah! Stop him!)
(The poor girl!)
Judge:
Order! Mr. Wright, you have been warned.
Phoenix:
(Poor girl!? What about poor me!?)
Leads to:
"You looked out the window. What did you see next?"




Back down







Phoenix:

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
The woman with long hair... that was Mia Fey?
April:
Um-hmm! Slender, sort of, well, some people might say pretty, if that's your thing.
Phoenix:

Edgeworth:
And the person attacking her?April:
The one attacking her was the mousey girl sitting in the defendant's chair!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
How do you know she was the defendant?
April:
Huh? Well... y'know! S-she had a girlish physique. Women know these things. Look... I-I just know, okay?
Edgeworth:
There was only one person at the scene of the crime with a short, girlish figure. The testimony is bulletproof, Your Honor.
Phoenix:
(He's right...)



Yep, he's right







Phoenix:
(Her testimony certainly does make sense... And everyone in the court keeps siding with her. I'd better not press too hard on this one.)
Edgeworth:
So then, tell us what happened to the victim.

How did you know it was my client!?
April:
Huh? Well, I... gee! First of all, she had a girl's physique! And, and secondly, she was... she was small! Who else could it be but her!
Phoenix:
(She has a point...)



You're right







Phoenix:
(Her testimony certainly does make sense... And everyone in the court keeps siding with her. I'd better not press too hard on this one. Maybe I should just listen to the testimony again.)
Leads back to cross-examination




I question your testimony







Leads to:
"Hold on a minute! That testimony stinks!"Phoenix:
(Hmm... that's it? Nothing really jumps out as a contradiction... There's got to be something in there somewhere! Maybe I'd better just press her on the facts a bit!)Phoenix:
Hold on a minute! That testimony stinks!April:
W-what!?Phoenix:
Miss May, I'm willing to bet that...You saw nothing







Phoenix:
Did you really see the defendant at all!?
Leads to:
"Urp!"You're lying







Phoenix:
Are you telling the truth? Did you really see the defendant!?
Leads to:
"Urp!"April:
Urp!Judge:
Mr. Wright! What's the meaning of this?April:
Yes, what is the meaning! Somebody tell me because I'm clueless! About this, I mean!Phoenix:
Okay... If you had really witnessed my client, Maya Fey... You would have noticed her clothes before noticing her physique!April:
...!Phoenix:
No one wears clothes like this on a daily basis! Except her! And I'm no expert on fashion, but her hairdo looks far from normal to me! However, the witness's testimony mentions neither of these things! The testimony is bogus!April:
But... but!Judge:
Still, we don't know if she was dressed that way the night of the murder...Phoenix:
She was, Your Honor! I saw her. And so did Detective Gumshoe! What do you say to that, Miss May?April:
Rowr! What are you trying to say, you mean lawyer! I-I saw what I saw. I... just didn't think all the trifling little details were necessary, darling.Judge:
Miss May. The court would like to remind you to please omit nothing in your testimony.April:
I'm sorry, Your Honor. I'll be a good girl. I promise. *wink*Judge:
Your testimony again, if you would.Phoenix:
(Damn, I almost had her!)Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --April:
I did see everything! I did!
The victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right.
Then the girl in the hippie clothes ran after her...
And she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did!
That... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? "The Thinker," I think?
Well? Does the accuracy of my report not startle you? Tee hee!Judge:
I... see. I only wish you had been so detailed from the beginning. Please begin the cross-examination.Cross Examination

2025-01-22 14:42:56,692 - INFO - Assistant reply: Given the context and testimonies, let's break down the contradictions:

1. **Statement 1**: The witness claims, "I did see everything! I did!"
2. **Statement 4**: "That... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? 'The Thinker,' I think?"

**Evidence 1**: 'The Thinker,' is described as a statue made by Larry Butz, which is actually a clock. However, it's noted that the clock's gears have been removed, rendering it non-functional as a clock at the time of the crime.

**Observation**: The witness referred to the murder weapon as a "clock." However, during the event in question, 'The Thinker' had already had its clockwork removed, meaning it couldn't have been identified as a clock based on the time-telling function. This discrepancy suggests that the identification of "The Thinker" as a clock could be known through prior knowledge rather than observation during the event.

**Conclusion**: Present evidence suggesting the witness's testimony is inconsistent since 'The Thinker' could not have been identified as a clock at the scene if it was purely an observation because it wasn't functioning as one.

**Action**: Present the evidence to highlight the contradiction in the testimony regarding the identification of 'The Thinker' as a clock.

The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say it was you...)Phoenix:\nMy name is Phoenix Wright. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\" In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!August 3, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.

Tell me, what's the victim's name?Phoenix:\n(Whew, I know this one! Glad I read the case report cover to cover so many times. It's... wait... Uh-oh! No... no way! I forgot! I'm drawing a total blank here!)Mia:\nPhoenix! Are you absolutely SURE you're up to this? You don't even know the victim's name!?Phoenix:\nOh, the victim! O-Of course I know the victim's name! I, um, just forgot. ...Temporarily (Changed from [I, um, just forgot. ... Temporarily.] in the original release)Mia:\nI think I feel a migraine coming on.

Now, tell me, what was the cause of death? She died because she was...?Poisoned\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOh, right! Wasn't she, um, poisoned by er... poison?\nJudge:\nYou're asking me!?\nPhoenix:\nUm... Chief! Help me out!\nMia:\nCheck the court record. [The R Button / Tab]... remember?

I suppose there's nothing to do but give you another try:\nLeads back to:\n\"She died because she was...?\"Phoenix:\nShe was struck once, by a blunt object.Judge:\nCorrect. You've answered all my questions. I see no reason why we shouldn't proceed. You seem much more relaxed, Mr. Wright. Good for you.Phoenix:\nThank you, Your Honor. (Because I don't FEEL relaxed, that's for sure.)Judge:\nWell, then... First, a question for the prosecution. Mr. Payne?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nAs Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to the court just what that \"object\" was?Payne:\nThe murder weapon was this statue of \"The Thinker.\" It was found lying on the floor, next to the victim.Judge:\nI see... The court accepts it into evidence. (Changed from [I see... the court accepts it into evidence.] in the original release)Statue added to the Court Record.Mia:\nWright...

WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?Payne:\nMr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by \"dumped.\" In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!Butz:\nWhaddya mean, \"one of them\"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!Payne:\nYour Honor, the victim's passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.Passport added to the Court Record.Judge:\nHmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.Butz:\nDude... no way...Payne:\nThe victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several \"Sugar Daddies.\"Butz:\nDaddies? Sugar?Payne:\nYes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.Butz:\nDuuude!Payne:\nWe can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?Mia:\nWright... I don't think you want him to answer that question.Phoenix:\n(Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)Wait and see what happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Might be better not to get involved in this one...)\nPayne:\nWell, Mr. Butz?\nButz:\nDude, no way!

Who is your witness?\"Judge:\nWell, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?Payne:\nThe man who found the victim's body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw the defendant fleeing the scene of the crime!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.Payne:\nYes, Your Honor.Phoenix:\n(This is bad...)Payne:\nOn the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim's building. Please bring Mr. Frank Sahwit to the stand!Payne:\nMr. Sahwit, you sell newspaper subscriptions, is this correct?Sahwit:\nOh, oh yes! Newspapers, yes!Judge:\nMr. Sahwit, you may proceed with your testimony. Please tell the court what you saw on the day of the murder.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Sahwit:\nI was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.\nI thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.\nThinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.\nThen I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!\nI quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.\nI thought to call the police immediately!\nHowever, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.\nI went to a nearby park and found a public phone.\nI remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.\nThe man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Judge:\nHmm...Phoenix:\n(Larry! Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!)Judge:\nIncidentally, why wasn't the phone in the victim's apartment working?Payne:\nYour Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.Judge:\nAren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.Blackout Record added to the Court Record.Judge:\nNow, Mr. Wright...Phoenix:\nYes! Er... yes, Your Honor?Judge:\nYou may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:\nC-Cross-examination, Your Honor?Mia:\nAlright, Wright, this is it. The real deal!Phoenix:\nUh... what exactly am I supposed to do?Mia:\nWhy, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!Phoenix:\nLies! What?! He was lying!?Mia:\nYour client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?Phoenix:\n!!! How do I prove he's not?Mia:\nYou hold the key! It's in the evidence! Compare the witness's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there! First, find contradictions between the Court Record and the witness's testimony. Then, once you've found the contradicting evidence... present it and rub it in the witness's face!Phoenix:\nUm... okay.Mia:\nOpen the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab], then point out contradictions in the testimony!

In this example, the witness claims to remember the time exactly as 1:00 PM, but the Cindy's Autopsy Report records the time of death between 4 PM-5 PM. This discrepancy can be presented as evidence to contradict the witness's statement.

Answer:
{
  "action": "present",
  "testimony": 9,
  "evidence": 2
}You may now present evidence that is helpful in finding a contradiction in the testimony. To present evidence, answer the question with a JSON object in the format of {"action": "present", "testimony": <number of the testimony>, "evidence": <number of the evidence>}, for example {"action": "present", "testimony": 5, "evidence": 2}.
Note that the evidence, character, and testimony is listed from 0 to n-1, so your response should be 0-indexed.
Explain your reasoning step by step before providing the JSON object.

A clock?Mia:
Yeah, it's made to look like that statue, "The Thinker." And it tells you the time! I thought you might like it. You always liked toys.???:
Hey! I'm not a little girl anymore, Sis!Mia:
Now, now. You know I'm only teasing. Ah, I should probably tell you, the clock isn't talking right now.???:
Huh? It's not working? That's lame!Mia:
I had to take the clockwork out. Sorry. I put some papers inside it instead.???:
Papers? Is that the evidence, then? Hmm, well... there's a possibility that it might turn out that way, yes.Mia:

Anywhere







Phoenix:
I smell blood... and that can't be good! I have to check and see if Mia... the Chief's okay!Phoenix:
That smell... Blood!???:
... *sob* Sis...Phoenix:
(Someone's there!) ...! Chief? Chief...?Chief!!!Phoenix:
Who are you????:
...Phoenix:
(The strange girl dropped out cold. I left her lying on the office sofa. I went back to the chief where she lay under the window. Her body was still warm... I could feel it when I held her shoulder. Then, all too quickly, it began to fade... Until finally she was cold.)Phoenix:
Chief...Examine









Broken glass







Phoenix:
Some shards of glass are scattered on the floor. They seem to be the remains of a glass light stand.




Chair







Phoenix:
The chief's chair. A simple, functional design. Feels pretty good to sit in, too.




Mia Fey's body







Phoenix:
Chief... It's hard seeing her like this, but if there are any clues here... She was struck on the head with a blunt object. She probably died instantly. "The Thinker" lying next to her must have been the murder weapon.
The Thinker added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
Hmm... there are some glass shards near the chief's body. Must be pieces of the glass light stand lying broken in the back of the room.
Glass Shards added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
Nothing else that seems like a clue here... Hmm...? A piece of paper! It must have fallen from Mia's hand! What could it be?




Mia Fey's body (subsequent times)







Phoenix:
It's painful to look... but I have to, for Mia's sake. Looks like she was hit in the head with a blunt weapon. She probably died instantly.




"Maya" scrap of paper (after examining Mia Fey's body; before clearing all Talk options at Fey & Co. Law Offices)







Phoenix:
! A word is written in blood on this scrap of paper! "Maya"...? Did Mia write this? This piece of paper is a receipt from a department store, dated yesterday.
Receipt added to the Court Record.

"The Thinker" statue







Phoenix:
It's encrusted with dried blood. How ironic that this became the murder weapon... again.




Window







Phoenix:
There's a large building right across from the office. The "Gatewater Hotel." A nice, luxurious place.




Bookshelf







Phoenix:
All the chief's important documents are packed in here. This is where she filed her case records and recent rulings.




Computer







Phoenix:
Surprisingly, the chief was never good with machines. About all she used this PC for was e-mail. She picked up this ancient model at some garage sale for practically nothing.




Desk







Phoenix:
A perfectly normal office desk. The chief had a very particular policy about office décor: "Spend big on stuff the clients use, but keep your own stuff simple."




Ledger book







Phoenix:
The Fey & Co. ledger book. Everything is written in the chief's ultra-neat handwriting. It's a small office, but it makes a good bit of money.




Corded phone







Phoenix:
Right! I'd better call the police! ...? That's funny... A few of the screws on the receiver are missing... It looks like someone was halfway through taking it apart.
???:
Police!? Please, come quick!
Phoenix:
(Wh-what was that!? Someone screaming from outside the window!?) ...! She's staring right at me! She's holding a phone in her hand...




Corded phone (subsequent times)

Bookshelf







Phoenix:
You couldn't cram more legal books in here, even if you wanted to. Few can gaze upon the shelves without feeling insignificant.




Door







Phoenix:
The door to the chief's office. It's slightly open. I'd better not touch the door knob.




Painting







Phoenix:
A large painting. I guess you'd call this "modern art." I, on the other hand, call it a mistake.




Reception desk







Phoenix:
The reception desk. I usually sit here.




Sofa







Phoenix:
This sofa is for clients. It's leather... a real luxury model.




Writing desk







Phoenix:
A small writing desk cluttered with office supplies.Talk









What happened







Phoenix:
(She seems to be in shock. I don't want to disturb her, but I have to know...) Um... excuse me? Can you tell me what happened?
Maya:
... I came in... The room was dark. And Sis... Sis...!
Phoenix:
(So she was already dead.)




You and the Chief







Phoenix:
So, you're the chief's...?
Maya:
Sister. I'm her younger sister.
Phoenix:
And you were here... visiting? This late at night?
Maya:
Yes. She said she wanted me to keep some evidence for her.
Phoenix:
Evidence...?
Maya:
Yes... I-it was that clock... It was "The Thinker."Present









The Thinker







Phoenix:
Um, about "The Thinker"...
Maya:
! The Th-Thinker... That was... Oh, Sis! *sob*
Phoenix:
(Hmm, probably shouldn't have asked her about the murder weapon...)




Glass Shards







Phoenix:
This was lying next to the chief.
Maya:
I know. I saw it there too. I thought they might be pieces of the light stand.
Phoenix:
Hmm. Maybe. (Never heard of a glass light stand before...)




Receipt (before examining corded phone in Office)







Phoenix:
Before Mia died, she wrote a message with her own blood. She wrote it on the back of this receipt.
Maya:
! Th-th-that's MY name! W-why!? Why would she write my name?
Phoenix:
Please, just calm down.
Maya:
W-why would Sis write my name?
Phoenix:
(Uh-oh. Now I've done it... I'd better hurry up and call the police!)

K-killer...? I'm not--Gumshoe:
Case closed! You're coming down to the precinct, ma'am.Maya:
W-what?Phoenix:
Mia's younger sister, Maya, was arrested on the spot. I was taken in for questioning and didn't get out until the next morning. My eyes were heavy... but I couldn't sleep. I sat around, waiting for visiting hours to begin at the detention center. I had to talk to Maya as soon as possible.September 6, 9:07 AMDetention CenterVisitor's RoomPhoenix:
(Wow, they have poor Maya locked up like a criminal.)Maya:
Oh! It's you! The lawyer... G-good morning.Phoenix:
Good morning! (She looks so tired...)Maya:
Um... Are you going to be my attorney?Phoenix:
Well, that's what I wanted to talk to you about...It's up to you







Phoenix:
(I'd better give it to her straight...) It's up to you.
Maya:
Up... to me?
Phoenix:
Yes. I don't think this is something I should decide. After all, you're the one in trouble here.
Maya:
... They're never going to believe me... are they? Even you, when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it!
Leads to:
"Did I look at her like that?"Of course I will







Phoenix:
(First things first, I better get her cheered up...) Yeah, of course I will! Cheer up!
Maya:
R-really...?
Phoenix:
(Whoa! Did I say the wrong thing? She looks sadder now!) Um... what... what's wrong? You don't think I can do it?
Maya:
... No... no one could! Who would believe me? Even you, when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it!
Leads to:
"Did I look at her like that?"Sorry, not a chance







Phoenix:
(Maybe if I joke a bit she'll cheer up...) Hah hah! No way, Jose! Just kidding...

Phoenix:
(Eh heh. Whoops. That didn't go so well.)
Maya:
...Heh...

Huh? M-Maya...? Was that a... chuckle?
Maya:
What? N-no! ... It wasn't very believable, was it?
Phoenix:
(Not really...)
Maya:
I-I'm sorry! I just thought, since you'd made a joke... Please, don't mind me! You're doing just fine!
Phoenix:
(Who's trying to cheer up who here!?)
Maya:
... I knew it. No one will believe me.
Phoenix:
What?

"Did I look at her like that?"Phoenix:
(Did I look at her like that?) No, no! I never thought...Maya:
I-it's okay. I understand. ... And... I've also heard about you.Phoenix:
Heard...? Heard what about me?Maya:
I... was talking to my sister on the phone the other day...Mia:
"Today was my junior partner's first time in court."Maya:
Wow! Really? How'd that go?Mia:
"It was quite the scene! Honestly, I was on edge the whole time. It's been a while..."Maya:
Hah! So, he crashed and burned?Mia:
"...He's a genius. One of those 'strike fear into the hearts of evil' types... The only thing he's lacking is... experience."Maya:
Huh, sounds like it was fun! Well, I know who to go to if I ever get into trouble now!Mia:
"I don't know, Maya. I think you might want to wait... give him three more years. That is, unless you want to be found guilty."Maya:
That's what she said!Phoenix:

Maya







Phoenix:
There's something I've been wanting to ask you...
Maya:
Yes?
Phoenix:
What's with that outfit?
Maya:
Oh, this? This is what all acolytes wear. It's my uniform, you could say.
Phoenix:
A-acolytes? Like people in religious training? What is it you do?
Maya:
Oh! It's nothing strange, really! I'm a spirit medium. ...In training.
Phoenix:
A s-spirit medium!? (I'm pretty sure that qualifies as strange.)




The day of the crime







Phoenix:
Could you tell me about the day of the murder?
Maya:
Yes! Let's see... that morning, I got a call from my sister. She wanted me to hold onto a piece of evidence for an upcoming trial.
Phoenix:
Evidence?
Maya:
Yes. That clock shaped like "The Thinker."
Phoenix:
(The one Larry made...) How could that have been evidence in a case?
Maya:
Um, right, she said something about that... ... I remember! Do you want to hear it in her own voice?
Phoenix:
H-her own voice!?
Maya:
Yes. I'm pretty sure our conversation is on my cell phone.
Phoenix:
You recorded it!
Maya:
Yeah! I forgot how to delete those things.




The day of the crime (after clearing "Your cell phone" Talk option)







Phoenix:
Could you tell me about the day of the murder? Sorry... I know it must be hard.
Maya:
No, it's okay. All I've been doing the last few hours is talking about it. I've kind of gotten used to it... Let's see... that morning, I got a call from my sister. She wanted me to hold onto a piece of evidence for an upcoming trial.
Phoenix:
(That's "The Thinker" clock that Larry made. It practically qualifies as a serial murderer by now.) So then, when did you arrive at the office?
Maya:
It was right around 9:00. The lights were off and... I could smell blood. Th-then I found her. My sister...
Phoenix:
Thanks, Maya. That's all I need to hear for now.




Your cell phone (appears after "The day of the crime")







Phoenix:
So, you say you have a conversation with your sister on your cell phone? Let's hear it!
Maya:
Right! Oh! I just remembered: that detective took my cell phone. Sorry.
Phoenix:
Oh, right. (Of course...) Next time I see Detective Gumshoe I'll ask him for it.
Maya:
I'll write you a note so you don't forget, okay?
Phoenix:
Sure, thanks.

Spirit mediums (appears after "Maya")







Phoenix:
So you're an acolyte. A, er, medium-in-training.
Maya:
That's right. The Fey family, especially the women, have always been very sensitive to the spirit world.
Phoenix:
Wait a second, you said the "Fey Family"? So, Mia was into this stuff too?
Maya:
Of course! She left the mountain to "follow her career," she said. Her powers were first-class, too!
Phoenix:
(I... I had no idea.) Hmm... Wait...!
Maya:
What?
Phoenix:
So, you're a real, honest-to-goodness spirit medium? With E.S.P. and all that?
Maya:
Yes. ...In training.
Phoenix:
Well, can't you contact Mia's spirit, then? We can just ask her who killed her!
Maya:
...! I-I'm sorry... I'm still in training. I couldn't do something on that level...

Absolutely none! Um... Do you trust me?

Hmm? You want to know the results, eh?

So, Mia's death was instantaneous.
Gumshoe:
That's right, pal. She was... a beautiful person.
Phoenix:
You knew her, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Sure. All of us down at the precinct knew Ms. Fey. Much as it pains me to say this, she was a darn good lawyer. Hey, what are you looking at? I just got a little dust in my eye, that's all.

Phoenix:
Um, about Maya...
Gumshoe:
Yeah! I'm looking forward to the trial! Sorry, pal, but this is one trial you aren't going to win!
Phoenix:
W-why do you say that?
Gumshoe:
The city's put Prosecutor Edgeworth on the prosecution!
Phoenix:
(Edgeworth...)
Gumshoe:
I'm sure you know what that means, you being a lawyer and all.




Edgeworth (appears after "Maya")







Phoenix:
Prosecutor Edgeworth...
Gumshoe:
That's right, pal! Mr. Miles Edgeworth himself! Wait... you do know him, don't you!?



Of course I do!







Phoenix:
I know him. He's a feared prosecutor. He doesn't feel pain, he doesn't feel remorse. He won't stop until he gets his "guilty" verdict.
Gumshoe:
Aww, don't talk about him that way. You make him barely sound human! Still, I'm afraid this pretty much decides the case.
Phoenix:
(So, Edgeworth is on this one... He hasn't lost a case since he became prosecutor at the incredibly young age of 20. Of course, there are rumors of back-alley deals and forged evidence...)

"All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion."




Of course not!







Phoenix:
Never heard of him.

Whoa! And you call yourself a lawyer, pal!? About four years ago, this Edgeworth guy became a prosecutor at the age of 20! Everyone says he's a genius. Surprised you don't know him!

Glass Shards







Phoenix:
There was broken glass at the crime scene, right?
Gumshoe:
Hmm? Oh, that? Seems like a glass stand next to the victim fell over. The glass shards were pieces of the broken stand.

Phoenix:
There was a piece of paper next to the victim, wasn't there?
Gumshoe:
Yeah. The one with the killer's name written on it!
Phoenix:
Are you sure that Mia wrote it herself?
Gumshoe:
Given the condition of the writing, it's hard to say if it's her handwriting or not.
Phoenix:

Nope. I know nothing, pal!

I only had my sister. My father died when I was very young. And I don't know where my mother is.
Phoenix:
(Don't know...? So she could still be alive?)




Your mother (appears after "Your family")







Maya:
The women in my family have been mediums for generations. They say a lotta spiritual power runs in our blood. (Changed from [They say that E.S.P. runs in our blood.] in the original release) About fifteen years ago, our family was involved in an... incident. There was a man, and he... he... He ruined our mother's life.
Phoenix:
("Ruined"...?)
Maya:
After that, she disappeared. Several years after that, my sister announced she would "become a lawyer" and she left the mountain.
Phoenix:
... So, you live by yourself?
Maya:
Yes. I've gotten used to it. Oh, also... I had to become independent, or I would lose my powers! (Changed from [I had to become independent, or I would lose my E.S.P.!] in the original release)
Phoenix:

Your mother's enemy (appears after "Your mother")







Phoenix:
So, who was this man who, um, "ruined" your mother?
Maya:
About 15 years ago... there was an unusual murder case. It made quite a stir, everyone was talking about it, apparently. The police were running out of leads, and they were getting desperate...
Phoenix:
Wait... they didn't use a spirit medium, did they?
Maya:
The police convinced my mother to try to contact the victim.
Phoenix:
Wow... So, what happened?
Maya:
The case was solved... we thought.
Phoenix:
You "thought"...?
Maya:
The man my mother helped the police capture was innocent.
Phoenix:
...!
Maya:
The police's consultation with a medium had all been carried out in secret, of course. But... A man found out about it and leaked it to the press. He told all the papers that my mother was a fraud, and the media jumped on it big time. She... my mother... became the laughing stock of the nation.

Tee hee! You know, you're cute when you blush.
Phoenix:
(Believe me, this is the first time in my life I've blushed this much...) Umm... eh heh. Right... can you just tell me what it is you do?
April:
Well... No! Tee hee! And you had your little hopes up, didn't you!
Phoenix:
(Oh boy.)




This room







Phoenix:
I see there are two glasses on the table. Is someone staying here with you?
April:
Oooh! What amazing powers of observation! You must be one of those famous detectives, like on television!
Phoenix:
Oh, no, not me, I'm, er, just a lawyer!
April:
Say, Mr. Big Detective, why don't you go look for clues... in the garbage? Hmm? Miss May doesn't like nosey little lawyers... Hmph!
Phoenix:
(Oh boy.)Present









Anything







April:
Excuse me, but I'm a witness? Police witness? You understand? How could I possibly give you any information in good conscience, hmm? Me... "the witness"! It's just like the movie!Grossberg Law Offices (after examining open drawer in Gatewater Hotel - Room 303)Phoenix:
(Hmm... seems like Mr. Grossberg is out. Well, maybe I should just wait here for him to come back.)???:
*Ah-HHHHEM!*Phoenix:
(If that wasn't the most over-the-top clearing of the throat I've ever heard!)Grossberg:
Ah hah! So, you're the one they say has been looking for me?Phoenix:
Uh... y-yes, that's me! (He looks even... grander than I imagined!)Grossberg:
Hmm...? That badge on your collar...? Ah, so you're a lawyer, are you now?Phoenix:
Y-yes, well... yes.Grossberg:
And what do you want? I'm not particularly busy these days... Please, proceed!Phoenix:
(Not busy...? Then how come no one could get in touch with you?)Grossberg:
Hmm? Something the matter? You came to see the one-and-only Marvin Grossberg, did you not? Well, here I am, boy! What do you want? Out with it!Phoenix:
Um... w-well, sir, actually it's about Maya. Maya Fey.Grossberg:
...! Ah... yes. Maya Fey. Go on.Phoenix:
(Hmm? Why the strange reaction?)Grossberg:
A-cha-cha. I'm really quite busy here, son. I can't go taking cases on a day's notice! No, it's quite impossible.Phoenix:
W-wait a second! How did you know the trial was tomorrow!?Grossberg:
Urk? Ahem! A-anyway... I'm afraid it's entirely impossible for me to represent her. Sorry. End of discussion.Phoenix:
(What's going on!? He refused me before I even got a chance to ask him! What do I tell Maya...?)Talk









Your refusal







Phoenix:
How can you just refuse like that! Please, tell me why you won't take the case!
Grossberg:
Hmm? Eh, ahem! Well, you see it's just... I'm busy, you see!
Phoenix:
But the client is Mia Fey's sister!
Grossberg:
Hmm... ahem.
Phoenix:
Mia trusted you... She knew her sister would be in good hands.
Grossberg:
Yes, yes, of course I know that. However! I'm sorry but, I must refuse. Sorry. Good-bye.
Phoenix:
Creep. Fine. I don't have time to argue with you anyway. I'll go look elsewhere.
Grossberg:
*grumble*... Think not.
Phoenix:
Huh? Did you say something?
Grossberg:
I think not, I said.
Phoenix:
Wh-what do you mean?
Grossberg:
I'm terribly, terribly sorry. But I'm afraid that no lawyer worth their salt will take on this particular case. Terribly sorry, m'boy.
Phoenix:
Why!?
Grossberg:
I... I cannot say. ... I beg your pardon, but could you leave? Now? I've nothing more to discuss with you.
Phoenix:
(What's going on here!?)




Mia







Phoenix:
How did you know Mia Fey...?
Grossberg:
... She... worked here. A long time ago. Quite the apprentice, that one. Learned my techniques in the blink of an eye! She left one day, quite suddenly... She had a mission, you see.
Phoenix:
A "mission"?
Grossberg:
You could see it in her eyes. She followed it with a burning passion. Never looked back, that one.




That painting







Phoenix:
That's... quite a painting.
Grossberg:
Ahah! You noticed! It's my pride and joy! Impressive, isn't it? Well? ISN'T IT? The color of the sky! The hue of the sea! The weave of the straw hat! It's worth at least three million. I have no intention of parting with it, of course. No, I won't sell it! Not even to you!
Phoenix:
(I wasn't interested...)
Grossberg:
It's not for sale!
Phoenix:
I'm not buying! (Geez!)Present

Part 4September 7, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 1Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Ms. Maya Fey.Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor. (Miles Edgeworth... I'd better not show any signs of weakness today, or he'll be on me in an instant.)Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth. Please give the court your opening statement.Edgeworth:
Thank you, Your Honor. The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, was at the scene of the crime. The prosecution has evidence she committed this murder... and we have a witness who saw her do it. The prosecution sees no reason to doubt the facts of this case, Your Honor.Judge:
I see. Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Let's begin then.Edgeworth:
If we may call our first witness, Your Honor. (Changed from [You may call your first witness.] in the original release) The prosecution calls the chief officer at the scene, Detective Gumshoe!Edgeworth:
Witness, please state your name and profession to the court.Gumshoe:
Sir! My name's Dick Gumshoe, sir! I'm the detective in charge of homicides down at the precinct, sir!Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe. Please, describe for us the details of this murder.Gumshoe:
Very well, sir! Let me use this floor map of the office to explain. The body was found by this window, here.Edgeworth:
And the cause of death?Gumshoe:
Loss of blood due to being struck by a blunt object, sir! The murder weapon was a statue of "The Thinker" found next to the body, sir! It was heavy enough to be a deadly weapon, even in a girl's hands, sir!Judge:
The court accepts the statue as evidence.Phoenix:
(They're still calling it a "statue"...)Floor Plans added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:
Now, Detective...Gumshoe:
Y-yes sir!Edgeworth:
You immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey, who was found at the scene, correct? Can you tell me why?Gumshoe:
Yes sir! I had hard evidence she did it, sir!Judge:
Hmm. Detective Gumshoe. Please testify to the court about this "hard evidence."Witness Testimony-- Maya Fey's Arrest --Gumshoe:
As soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!
There were two people there already:
The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.
I immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey!
Why? We had a witness account describing her!
The witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder!Judge:
Hmm... The very moment, you say. Very well. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor. (Cross-examine what...? I couldn't see a single contradiction in that testimony...)...whoosh...SMACK!Phoenix:
(Hey! Maya just threw something at me... What's this? "When my sister couldn't find any contradictions in a witness's testimony she would bluff it and press the witness on every detail! The witness always slips up and says something wrong... It worked lots of times!" Heh... I should have expected Maya would know some of her sister's tricks! Alright. Let's give this a try!)Judge:
Something the matter?Phoenix:
No, Your Honor. I'd like to begin my cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Maya Fey's Arrest --Gumshoe:
As soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Who did you say you got a call from?
Gumshoe:
Hey pal, don't play dumb! You know who! The call was from a customer at the Gatewater Hotel, right across from the crime scene!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... okay, I pressed. Not sure it did much, though.) Right. Please continue.Gumshoe:
There were two people there already:Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe, how long would you say it took, between you receiving the call, and your arrival at the scene of the crime?
Gumshoe:
Hmm, right... I'd say it was about 3 minutes!
Phoenix:
Th-that's pretty fast!
Gumshoe:
Our motto this month is "quick response"! That's how I got there before the killer got away!
Edgeworth:
Indeed! So, tell us who the two people you found on the scene were.
Gumshoe:
Yes sir!Gumshoe:
The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Are you absolutely sure it was us?
Gumshoe:
Listen pal, your dumb act will only get you so far! With her funky hippie clothes and your spiky hair? You two stand out like... like suspicious people at a crime scene!
Phoenix:
(Well... he does have a point about her. She is pretty unmistakable. I should pick my points to press with a little more care...)Gumshoe:
I immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Why's that? What's your reason?Gumshoe:
Why? We had a witness account describing her!Press

"Hold on just one second!"Gumshoe:

Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Hold on just one second!"Phoenix:
(I can't see a single contradiction in there! I'll just have to take Maya's advice and press him on anything suspicious!)Phoenix:
Hold on just one second!Gumshoe:
Y-yeah?Phoenix:
If I heard correctly... You said you arrested her because you had "hard evidence" she did it, correct?Gumshoe:
Huh? Did... did I say that? Me?Phoenix:
I heard you say it!Judge:
You did say it.Edgeworth:
You said it.Phoenix:
Exactly what about this suspicious woman in pink's claim was "hard evidence"!?Gumshoe:
Wh-what!? Miss May isn't suspicious, and she sure isn't pink, pal! W-well, I guess she is pink...Judge:
That's enough, Detective Gumshoe. Do you have any more solid proof other than her claims, Detective?Gumshoe:
Umm...Phoenix:
(Hmm! I guess pressing can have its advantages!)Gumshoe:
... Yes.Phoenix:
(Gah!)Gumshoe:
Sorry, I got the order of things mixed up in my testimony, Your Honor Sir! There was something I should have told you about first, Your Honor!Judge:
Very well, Detective. Let's hear your testimony again.Witness Testimony-- Hard Evidence --Gumshoe:
After securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.
I found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!
On it, the word "Maya" was written clearly in blood!
Lab test results showed that the blood was the victim's!
Also, there was blood found on the victim's finger!
Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!
How you like that? That's my "hard evidence"!Judge:
Hmm... Before we begin cross-examination, I have a question for you, Detective.Gumshoe:
Y-Your Honor?Judge:
Why didn't you testify about this vital piece of evidence the first time!?Gumshoe:
Ah... eh... I know. I'm real embarrassed I forgot about it, Your Honor Sir.Judge:
Try to be more careful! Very well, the defense may begin its cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Hard Evidence --Gumshoe:
After securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
And did you find any evidence?
Gumshoe:
Now, now, don't jump the gun on me, pal. Just listen. I'm getting to the good part!
Phoenix:
(I got a bad feeling about this...)Gumshoe:
I found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Just because you found it next to the body doesn't mean the victim wrote it!
Gumshoe:
Ho hoh! Then who did write it, smarty-pants?
Phoenix:
Wh-who? Um...



The killer







Phoenix:
Th-the killer! Anyone can see that!
Gumshoe:
Hoh. You're saying the killer wrote her OWN name!? Buddy, please!
Phoenix:
She was framed!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Hold on. If that's the case, where's your evidence?
Phoenix:
Ah... (Urk!)
Edgeworth:
Hah! I guess that was a bit of a tall order for you. Those without evidence shouldn't open their mouths, Mr. Wright.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, pal!
Phoenix:
(Argh...!)
Leads to:
"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found."




Miss May







Phoenix:
Well... it could have been the witness, Miss May!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Hold on. The witness was in her hotel room, not the office. Try pulling the other leg, Mr. Wright!
Gumshoe:
Yeah, and while you're at it, pull mine too, pal!
Phoenix:
(Argh...!)
Leads to:
"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found."




I did







Phoenix:
It... it could have been me!
Gumshoe:
What! S-so it was you!
Phoenix:
No, no, no, I'm just saying it COULD have been me! Can you prove it wasn't?
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Hold on. So, you admit to this? You admit that you wrote the note?
Phoenix:
Uh...
Edgeworth:
Listen to me, Mr. Wright. This is a court of law, and I expect you to refrain from making thoughtless statements! Amateur!
Phoenix:
(...!)
Leads to:
"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found."

Judge:
Yes, that was quite clear. You may continue with your testimony.
Gumshoe:
Th-thanks, pal. I mean Your Honor Sir.
Edgeworth:

Gumshoe:
Y-yeah?
Edgeworth:
I think you can expect a pleasant bonus in your next pay check.

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe! Do you get a lot of cases where the victim actually writes the killer's name?
Gumshoe:
Sure! It happens all the time in books and the movies!
Phoenix:
This isn't a movie, Detective.
Gumshoe:
Oof!
Phoenix:
Let's talk about reality, shall we?
Gumshoe:
Umm... I guess, I haven't heard of many cases... no.
Phoenix:
Don't you find it a little odd that the victim would write down a name? Especially the name of her own sister?
Gumshoe:
Ah, yeah, actually, you got a point, pal.
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Stop right there. The witness's opinion on the matter is irrelevant! The facts are clear: the victim wrote down the name of the accused... The victim told us the name of her killer!
Judge:
Order! Order!
Phoenix:
(That didn't go so well...)
Gumshoe:
Th-that's right! What he said!Present Mia's Autopsy Report







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Detective Gumshoe!"Phoenix:
(That's his whole testimony... Okay, there has to be a contradiction in there somewhere. Let's find it!)Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe! There's one thing I want you to clarify for me here. You say that the victim, Mia Fey, wrote this note. That she was accusing the defendant, Maya Fey? That's really what you're saying?Gumshoe:
Wh-what? This isn't one of those lawyer tricks, now, is it? Of course she wrote it! Who else could have!?Phoenix:
You have it backwards, Detective.Gumshoe:
B-backwards?Phoenix:
The victim is the only person who absolutely could NOT have written it! This is a report from your department, Detective. "Immediate death due to a blow from a blunt object." She died immediately!Gumshoe:
But...!Phoenix:
No "but"-ing your way out of this one, Detective!Judge:
Order! Order! The defense has a point. Someone who died immediately wouldn't have the time to write anything down.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright. I beg your pardon, but when exactly did you obtain that autopsy report?Phoenix:
Wh-when...!?The day of the murder







Phoenix:
I... I'm pretty sure it was the day of the murder.
Gumshoe:
You're wrong there, pal! We didn't write an autopsy report 'til the day after!
Phoenix:
Oh. Right.
Leads to:
"The prosecution's point being...?"The day after the murder







Phoenix:
It was the day after the murder...
Leads to:
"The prosecution's point being...?"I forget







Phoenix:
I'm... sorry, I forgot.
Edgeworth:
Hah! Forgot, you say?
Gumshoe:
It was the day after the murder, Your Honor Sir. I was the one who handed it to him myself! Personally!
Phoenix:
Oh. R-right.
Leads to:
"The prosecution's point being...?"Judge:
The prosecution's point being...?Edgeworth:
That autopsy report is outdated, Your Honor.Phoenix:
Wh-what!?Edgeworth:
A second autopsy was performed yesterday, at my request! "Death was almost immediate due to a blow from a blunt object... But there is a possibility the victim lived for several minutes after the blow." I received these results this morning.Phoenix:
N-no way!Edgeworth:
Your Honor! It's quite easy to imagine that the victim did have time to write "Maya"! That is all.Judge:
I see!Phoenix:
(Damn you, Edgeworth! I should have known you'd have something up your sleeve!)Edgeworth:
Why, Mr. Wright, you look shocked! Something you want to say?You're a sham, Edgeworth!







Phoenix:
Mr. Edgeworth... I've heard there's nothing you won't do to get your verdict... What reason could you possibly have had to request a second autopsy report?
Judge:
Mr. Wright! The defense will refrain from personal attacks on the prosecution!
Edgeworth:
No matter, Your Honor... Mr. Wright. Say what you will, the evidence in this report is undeniable.
Leads to:
"Your Honor, I submit this report to the court."The detective's a sham!







Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe! You're a sham! How could you give me a faulty report!?
Gumshoe:
Huh? I-I thought...
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe.
Gumshoe:
Urp!
Edgeworth:
I'm disappointed in you, handing him the wrong report like that.
Gumshoe:
Eh...? I... I'm sorry, sir.
Edgeworth:
You are at fault, Detective. This isn't going to look good on your evaluation next month.
Gumshoe:
W-what? B-but... *sigh*
Leads to:
"Your Honor, I submit this report to the court."I'm a sham!

Your Honor, I submit this report to the court.Judge:
U-understood. The court accepts the evidence.Autopsy Report updated in the Court Record.Edgeworth:
Well, Your Honor? The evidence strongly suggests the victim was identifying the killer.Judge:
I suppose that's the obvious conclusion, yes.Phoenix:
(Darn! This isn't good!)Edgeworth:
The prosecution would like to call its next witness. This poor, innocent girl saw the murder with her own eyes!Judge:
Let the witness Miss April May take the stand.Phoenix:

Witness, your name, please.April:

Tell us, where were you on the night of September 5, when the murder occurred?April:
Um... gee... I was, like, in my hotel room? Tee hee. I checked in right after lunch.Edgeworth:
And this hotel is directly across from the Fey & Co. Law Offices?April:
Mmm... that's right, big boy.Judge:

And then, oooh! I saw a woman with long hair being attacked!
The one attacking her was the mousey girl sitting in the defendant's chair!
Then the woman, like, dodged to one side and ran away!
But that girl, she caught up to her and... and... She hit her!
Then the woman with long hair...
She kinda... slumped.
The end. That's all I saw. Every little bitsy witsy! *wink*Judge:
Hmm...Edgeworth:
Well, Your Honor?Judge:
I see. It is a remarkably solid testimony. I don't see a need to trouble the witness any...Phoenix:
W-wait, Your Honor!Judge:
Yes, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:
What about my cross-examination!?Judge:
I thought the witness's testimony just now was quite... firm. Didn't you?Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright... I understand you were Ms. Mia Fey's understudy, were you not? You must know her techniques well. Her cowardly way of finding tiny faults in perfectly good testimonies...Phoenix:
H-hey! How dare you!Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? Will you cross-examine the witness?Yes, I'm doing it







Phoenix:
I'll gladly proceed with the cross-examination. (If only because I have a feeling Edgeworth doesn't want me to! She has to have some weakness!)
Leads to:
"Very well, you may begin your cross-examination!"No thanks







Phoenix:
No... you're right. I guess there wouldn't be much point.
Edgeworth:
Heh heh heh. I'm glad you saw the error of your ways so soon! Your Honor. The prosecution rests its case!
Phoenix:
(Wh-what? That's it!?)
Judge:
Very well.
Phoenix:
W-wait! Hold on!
Judge:
Yes, Mr. Wright? Changed your mind? Will you cross-examine the witness?
Phoenix:
Yes yes yes! (I'd better, or I'll lose on the spot!)
Leads to:
"Very well, you may begin your cross-examination!"Judge:
Very well, you may begin your cross-examination!Cross Examination-- Witness's Account --April:
It was, like, 9:00 at night. I looked out the window, y'know!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Why did you do that?
April:
Huh? "Why"? Like, why what?
Phoenix:
Why did you look out the window? Were you expecting to see something?
April:
Oh, well, um... gee!
Phoenix:
(What? That's it? She can't get out of this question that easily!)
April:
I sort of, y'know. I had a feeling!
Phoenix:
(Well, I have a feeling she's trying to avoid the question! Maybe I should press a little harder on this one?)



Go for it







Phoenix:
(Let's see how far I can run with this...) Surely, you must have had a reason to look out your window at that time of night!
April:
I... oooh!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright! I will not have you badgering my witness!
Phoenix:
B-badgering?
Edgeworth:
You insist on needling her with these trivial questions. I really don't think it should be allowed.
(Yeah! Yeah! Stop him!)
(The poor girl!)
Judge:
Order! Mr. Wright, you have been warned.
Phoenix:
(Poor girl!? What about poor me!?)
Leads to:
"You looked out the window. What did you see next?"




Back down







Phoenix:
(If I go too deep, I might not come back out alive... I'll back off for now.)
Leads to:
"You looked out the window. What did you see next?"


Edgeworth:
You looked out the window. What did you see next?April:
And then, oooh! I saw a woman with long hair being attacked!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
The woman with long hair... that was Mia Fey?
April:
Um-hmm! Slender, sort of, well, some people might say pretty, if that's your thing.
Phoenix:
(Your... thing?)
Edgeworth:
And the person attacking her?April:
The one attacking her was the mousey girl sitting in the defendant's chair!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
How do you know she was the defendant?
April:
Huh? Well... y'know! S-she had a girlish physique. Women know these things. Look... I-I just know, okay?
Edgeworth:
There was only one person at the scene of the crime with a short, girlish figure. The testimony is bulletproof, Your Honor.
Phoenix:
(He's right...)



Yep, he's right







Phoenix:
(Her testimony certainly does make sense... And everyone in the court keeps siding with her. I'd better not press too hard on this one.)
Edgeworth:
So then, tell us what happened to the victim.
Leads back to cross-examination




I question the testimony







Leads to:
"Hold on a minute! That testimony stinks!"April:
Then the woman, like, dodged to one side and ran away!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
She "dodged"? Dodged what!?
April:
Well... the attack!
Edgeworth:
Please, continue your testimony.April:
But that girl, she caught up to her and... and... She hit her!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
How did you know it was my client!?
April:
Huh? Well, I... gee! First of all, she had a girl's physique! And, and secondly, she was... she was small! Who else could it be but her!
Phoenix:
(She has a point...)



You're right







Phoenix:
(Her testimony certainly does make sense... And everyone in the court keeps siding with her. I'd better not press too hard on this one. Maybe I should just listen to the testimony again.)
Leads back to cross-examination




I question your testimony







Leads to:
"Hold on a minute! That testimony stinks!"Phoenix:
(Hmm... that's it? Nothing really jumps out as a contradiction... There's got to be something in there somewhere! Maybe I'd better just press her on the facts a bit!)Phoenix:
Hold on a minute! That testimony stinks!April:
W-what!?Phoenix:
Miss May, I'm willing to bet that...You saw nothing







Phoenix:
Did you really see the defendant at all!?
Leads to:
"Urp!"You're lying







Phoenix:
Are you telling the truth? Did you really see the defendant!?
Leads to:
"Urp!"April:
Urp!Judge:
Mr. Wright! What's the meaning of this?April:
Yes, what is the meaning! Somebody tell me because I'm clueless! About this, I mean!Phoenix:
Okay... If you had really witnessed my client, Maya Fey... You would have noticed her clothes before noticing her physique!April:
...!Phoenix:
No one wears clothes like this on a daily basis! Except her! And I'm no expert on fashion, but her hairdo looks far from normal to me! However, the witness's testimony mentions neither of these things! The testimony is bogus!April:
But... but!Judge:
Still, we don't know if she was dressed that way the night of the murder...Phoenix:
She was, Your Honor! I saw her. And so did Detective Gumshoe! What do you say to that, Miss May?April:
Rowr! What are you trying to say, you mean lawyer! I-I saw what I saw. I... just didn't think all the trifling little details were necessary, darling.Judge:
Miss May. The court would like to remind you to please omit nothing in your testimony.April:
I'm sorry, Your Honor. I'll be a good girl. I promise. *wink*Judge:
Your testimony again, if you would.Phoenix:
(Damn, I almost had her!)Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --April:
I did see everything! I did!
The victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right.
Then the girl in the hippie clothes ran after her...
And she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did!
That... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? "The Thinker," I think?
Well? Does the accuracy of my report not startle you? Tee hee!Judge:
I... see. I only wish you had been so detailed from the beginning. Please begin the cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Witness's Account --April:
I did see everything! I did!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So, you saw me then, too?
April:
Of course! I'd remember that spiky hair anywhere!
Phoenix:
(Spiky...?)
Judge:
The witness will refrain from personal attacks on the defense attorney.
April:
Aww, was I a bad girl? I'm sowwy.
Judge:
Very well... continue.April:
The victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Is that "right" as in your right, as you looked from the hotel?
April:
Um... which hand do I hold my knife in again...? Right! It was my right hand! Right?
Edgeworth:
Satisfied, Mr. Wright? Please continue.April:
Then the girl in the hippie clothes ran after her...Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
How convenient for you to remember her "hippie" clothes!
April:
That's what you--I mean, that's what she was wearing! Oh, and her hair was all done up like a bun!
Phoenix:
(*sigh*...)
Judge:
What happened then?April:
And she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Where did this weapon come from?
April:
She picked it up from the desk!
Judge:
I see. What sort of weapon was it?April:
That... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? "The Thinker," I think?Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
A... clock? (Didn't this come up in another testimony recently...?)
April:
W-well? Don't look so sour, Mr. Lawyer. You can't win them all.
Phoenix:
(No... but I have a feeling I'm on to something now!)Present The Thinker







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Miss May."Phoenix:
(Her previous testimony must have been what Edgeworth wanted her to say... So this was the testimony in her own words...? Time to press and squeeze the truth out of her! Figuratively, of course.)Phoenix:
Miss May. What you said just now was quite... revealing.April:
Revealing? Oooh, you'd like that, wouldn't you. Naughty Mr. Lawyer...Phoenix:
You just said that this statue of "The Thinker" was a clock. But there's no way of knowing that just by looking at it!April:
Urp!Phoenix:
Another person in much the same position as you recently called this a "clock," too... And he was found guilty... of murder!Judge:
Order! Order!Phoenix:
Miss May. Can you explain how you know this was a clock?April:
Oooh... urp!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
The witness saw the murder with her own eyes! That's all that's important here! The defense is trying to confuse the issue with trivial concerns!Judge:
Yes... yes, of course. You will withdraw your question, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:Phoenix:
But questions are all I have, Your Honor! And as you may recall, I've caught murderers with these questions before! (Well, only once...)Judge:
... ... Objection sustained. You may continue to question the witness.Phoenix:
(Whew, that was close. If he stopped me there, the trial would be over!)April:
Huh? What? So... what happens now?Phoenix:
What happens now is you answer my question! How did you know it was a clock?April:
What...! Th-that's... ...Because... I heard it? Yes! I heard it say the time!Phoenix:
So, you've been to the law offices of Fey & Co.!April:
N-n-no! Hey, I didn't say that! Why would I go there! I heard from my hotel room. Hee hee!Edgeworth:
The law offices of Fey & Co., where the murder took place, are very close to the hotel. She could easily have heard the clock!Judge:
Hmm. Well, Mr. Wright? Are you satisfied?Phoenix:
No, Your Honor! (I can't give up now!) I'm not satisfied because...She couldn't have heard it







Phoenix:
You were at the hotel! There's no way you could have heard a clock go off in the building next door!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
You have proof that she could not?
Phoenix:
Uh...
Edgeworth:
Amateurs, amateurs. Listen to me, Mr. Wright. In the courtroom, proof is everything. Without it, you have nothing. You ARE nothing.
Phoenix:
Then I would like to propose a test to see if she really could have heard...
Edgeworth:
The prosecution denies your request!
Phoenix:
Wh-what!? On what grounds?
Edgeworth:
This is a trivial matter with no direct bearing on the case at hand!
Judge:
Indeed. Objection sustained.
Phoenix:
(Damn! Time to switch directions... quick!)
Judge:
Ready to proceed, Mr. Wright?
Leads back to:
"No, Your Honor!"It couldn't have rung







Leads to:
"Your Honor, members of the court..."Phoenix:
Your Honor, members of the court... It is inconceivable that the clock in question rang!It's empty







Phoenix:
That clock is missing its clockwork!
Judge:
H-how could you possibly...?
Phoenix:
Just have a look... Right now! (Changed from [Just have a look... As soon as you can!] in the original release)
Judge:
... Oh!
Phoenix:
See anything interesting, Your Honor?
Judge:
It is as the defense says!
Leads to:
"This clock is missing its clockwork!"It's broken







Phoenix:
I-I think it's broken! That clock's busted!
Judge:
You "think"?
Phoenix:
J-just look at it! Your Honor, please examine the clock!
Judge:
Hmm... Oh!
Phoenix:
See anything interesting, Your Honor?
Judge:
Well, I'm not sure I would call this "broken," but I doubt it could ring...!
Leads to:
"This clock is missing its clockwork!"The batteries are dead







Phoenix:
The batteries on that clock must be dead!
Judge:
"Must be," Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Your Honor, if you would inspect the clock...!
Judge:
Hmm... very well. ... Oh!
Phoenix:
Well, Your Honor? Are they...?
Judge:
This clock has graver problems than dead batteries!
Leads to:
"This clock is missing its clockwork!"Judge:
This clock is missing its clockwork! It's quite empty! Mr. Wright! Would you care to explain to the court the meaning of this?Phoenix:
It is as you can see. The "clock" was empty. It couldn't have rung! Therefore, this witness... is a big, fat liar!April:
F-fat!?Phoenix:
Well, Miss May?Edgeworth:
Tsk tsk.Phoenix:
?Edgeworth:
Quite a show you've put on for us, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:
(He knew the clock was empty! Somehow... he knew!)Edgeworth:
I'm afraid you've forgotten one thing, however. Indeed, the clock is empty. As you say... it can't ring. However, we must ask: when was the clockwork removed? If it was after the witness heard the clock, then there is no contradiction!Judge:
! Hmm! That's true. That is a possibility. The clock might have been emptied after she heard it.Edgeworth:
And that is exactly what happened, Your Honor!Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? Can you prove when the clockwork was removed?Edgeworth:
Ho hoh! Impossible, of course...Phoenix:
I have proof.Edgeworth:
W-what!?Phoenix:
Wasn't it you who told me "proof is everything"? Well, I was listening. And now I'll show you the "proof" you like so much! The evidence that proves when the clockwork was removed is...Present Maya's Cell Phone







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Take a look at this!"Present anything else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What do you say to that?
April:
W-what? I don't rightly understand what that's supposed to mean!
Judge:
I don't rightly understand either.
Edgeworth:
Ho hoh!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh... I think I blew it.)
Judge:
Mr. Wright, please refrain from flippant presentations of evidence in the future.
Phoenix:
S-sorry, Your Honor!
Leads back to:
"The evidence that proves when the clockwork was removed is..."Phoenix:
Take a look at this!Judge:
Hmm. That's a very cute cell phone.April:
Ooh hoo! You have a girlie phone!Phoenix:
W-wait! Wait! This isn't my phone! Listen! This is the defendant's cell phone, and it contains a recording... A recording of a conversation she had with the victim on the day of the murder!Judge:
Order! Order!Edgeworth:
The defendant's cell phone!? Th-this wasn't brought to my attention!Phoenix:
Perhaps Detective Gumshoe overlooked it?Edgeworth:
*grumble* (The good detective better remember he's up for evaluation soon...)Phoenix:
(I gotta say, I'm starting to feel bad for the big fella.) (Changed from [My heart goes out to you, Edgeworth. Not.] in the original release) Let's hear the conversation.Cellular:*beep*...Maya:
[So you just want me to hold on to "The Thinker" for you, then?]Mia:
[If you could. Ah... I should probably tell you, the clock isn't talking right now.]Maya:
[Huh? It's not working? That's lame!]Mia:
[I had to take the clockwork out, sorry.]...[September 5, 9:27 AM]Cellular:*beep*Phoenix:
Your Honor, I think this makes it clear the clockwork was already gone by the time this was recorded, (Changed from [I think this recording makes it clear that the clockwork was already gone...] in the original release) which was well before the witness even arrived at her hotel! (Changed from [and this was recorded in the morning, before the witness even arrived at her hotel!] in the original release)April:
Muh... muh... muh!?Phoenix:
Well, Miss May? Would you care to explain this to the court? Just how did you know that weapon was a clock!?April:
... W-well...! Well, isn't it o-obvious? I saw that clock before! Um... what store was that again? I-I go to so many! Oops! I forgot! *wink*Judge:
So the witness had seen it before. That would make sense. Does the defense have any objections, Mr. Wright?Yes







Leads to:
"The witness claims she had "seen it before.""No







Phoenix:
Oh right... well, if she had seen it before, I guess... (Wait a second!)
Judge:
Then, the court would like--
Phoenix:
Hold on! P-please wait, Your Honor!
Judge:
Y-yes...? So you do have an objection?
Phoenix:
Um, yes, well...
Judge:
Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Sorry, Your Honor, it's just...
Leads to:
"The witness claims she had "seen it before.""Phoenix:
The witness claims she had "seen it before." But this directly contradicts a piece of evidence already submitted to this court!Judge:
Well then, let's see it. Please produce this evidence that will prove the witness had not seen the clock before.Present The Thinker







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"It's simple."Present anything else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Here is undeniable proof!
Edgeworth:
Hah!? Please, this is a court case, not some surrealist performance art piece!
Judge:
Hmm... Perhaps the defense would like to change its mind?
Leads back to:
"Please produce this evidence that will prove the witness had not seen the clock before."Phoenix:
It's simple. This clock was never in any store, ever!April:
W-whaaat!?Phoenix:
A friend of mine made that clock. Only two exist in the world. And the one that isn't here is in police custody!April:
I-impossible! Everything is sold in stores!Phoenix:
Miss May, I think it's high time you went shopping for a better excuse...?April:
Mmpf...Phoenix:
Oh? Excuses not on sale today?April:
Oooh? Oh ho ho. Mmmrrrrph! Ooooorrrrrrr ggggghhhhhhh... hhh!!! What's it to you, porcupine-head!? That stupid clock doesn't matter, okay!? She did it! And she should die for it! Die!Judge:
W-w-whoa! Let's not get ahead of ourselves. T-this is a court of law, and the witness will remain calm!April:
Hrrrgh... hrrrh... Hrrr... heh. Oh? Oh! Oh? Oh hoh ho! S-silly me! *grunt* Did I, um, like... lose it? I guess I did. Tee hee! *wink*Phoenix:
(S-scary...)Judge:
Miss May, let me ask. Tell me, how did you know the weapon was a clock?April:
...Judge:
Hmm... oh dear. Does the defense have an opinion on this... behavior?Phoenix:
(Okay, this is it!) Yes, Your Honor. Allow me to explain how I see the truth of the matter. Miss April May, you knew the weapon was a clock because...You held it







Phoenix:
(This is familiar territory. I'll just use the same approach as with Larry.) Miss May held that very clock in her hands!
Judge:
Mr. Wright! When was this!?
Phoenix:
When she used it to strike the victim! When else?
Judge:
Order! Order! Mr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!?
Phoenix:
April May, you killed Mia Fey, I say! And when you struck, the force of the impact made "The Thinker" ring! That's when you heard it!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
... Tsk tsk. You truly are a work of art, Mr. Phoenix Wright.
Phoenix:
W-what's that supposed to mean!?
Edgeworth:
It was you who just proved that "The Thinker" was empty!
Phoenix:
Oh... (Urk! Of course it wouldn't ring!)
Edgeworth:
What's more, the witness has a rock-solid alibi. Miss May? Perhaps you could explain to the poor, misguided Mr. Wright? You were in the hotel at the time of the murder.
Phoenix:
(S-she can't prove it! She did it!)
April:
It would be MY pleasure!
Phoenix:
N-no way!
April:
Yes way, Mr. Lawyer. Tee hee? Didn't the murder take place at 9:00 at night? Gee, that's the exact time I ordered some room service from the hotel bellboy!
Edgeworth:
Incidentally, the bellboy corroborates the witness's story. Ergo, she was not at the crime scene! Rock solid!
Judge:
Mr. Wright! You've just made a serious accusation to a perfectly innocent woman!
Phoenix:
S-sorry, Your Honor. (That... didn't go so well. But, if that's the case... Then how did she know "The Thinker" was a clock!? ... Wait!) Your Honor, I figured it out! There is one other way Miss April May could have known it was a clock! One way alone! And I have proof!
Judge:
Well... proof, you say? Then, the court will examine your proof, Mr. Wright. How did the witness know "The Thinker" was a clock?



Present Maya's Cell Phone







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
The defendant's cell phone.
Judge:
Yes, we've seen that already.
Phoenix:
Take another listen to the conversation between the defendant and victim.
Cellular:

Maya:

Mia:
[Well, actually there's something I want you to hold on to for me.]
Maya:

Mia:
[It's... a clock. It's made to look like that statue, "The Thinker." And it tells you the time!]

Judge:
They do mention "The Thinker." But how would the witness know of this conversation? Do you have proof that she knew of the conversation?



Present Wiretap

"Have a look at this."




Present anything else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
(Wait... no, this can't be right! I can't afford any mistakes now!)

Phoenix:
Have a look at this.
April:
Ah! Oooh! Th-that!? Eh heh...
Phoenix:
I found this in Miss May's room.
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Please explain to the court what this is!
Phoenix:
Miss April May! You used a wiretap to listen to this conversation! That's how you knew "The Thinker" was a clock! Am I wrong!?
April:
I... I...
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Your Honor, this is ridiculous!
Phoenix:
Your Honor, look at the witness's face? Does she seem amused to you!? The defense demands an answer.
April:
La... laaa... lrrrrgf!
Judge:
Witness, answer the question. Did you tap her phone?
April:
...
Judge:
Miss May!
April:
Shut up, all of you! What gives you the right to talk to ME like that! You... you LAWYER!
......
April:
I-it's no fair! All of you g-ganging up on me like that... Oh, so I'm the bad girl, is that it? Is that it!? Uh... uh... uwaaaaaaah!
Phoenix:
(That did it! The court's seen the real Miss April May now! Now to deal the final blow!)



You did it, didn't you?







Phoenix:
Miss May, confess. You did it, didn't you?
April:
Are you out of your mind!? Oh wait, I forgot... you're a lawyer! You must be! At the time of the murder... I was in my hotel room, getting room service! How could I have killed her? If you don't believe me, just ask the bellboy!
Leads to:
"Well, does the defense have anything to say?"




Why the wiretap?







Phoenix:
Miss May... Why did you tap her phone?
April:
...
Phoenix:
Answer the question!
April:
Do I have to? Isn't this a murder trial? Isn't tippity-tapping er... irrelevant?
Phoenix:
(Gah! She's saying exactly what Edgeworth wants her to say.) Miss May. You were tapping the victim's phone! I hardly call that "irrelevant"!
Judge:
While this court does not condone the defense's tone of voice, he has a point. (Changed from [While this court does not condone the defense's tone of speech, he has a point.] in the original release) Well, Miss May? Do you have an explanation for the court? Can you prove you had nothing to do with this murder, even though you tapped her phone?
April:
At the time of the murder... I was in my hotel room, getting room service! How could I have killed her? If you don't believe me, just ask the bellboy!
Leads to:
"Well, does the defense have anything to say?"

Phoenix:
Miss April May? You were tapping the victim, Ms. Mia Fey's phone, were you not?
April:
Oooh. Oooooh!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Your Honor, This is irrelevant!
Judge:
I'm not entirely sure that it is. Objection overruled. It troubles me that our witness was in possession of a wiretap.
Edgeworth:
This is outrageous! Does the defense truly claim that the witness was tapping her phone?
Phoenix:
Absolutely!
Edgeworth:
Even if that was the case, (which it's not) you still have to prove one thing! Did the victim ever say that the weapon was a clock on the phone? Can you prove that? I THINK NOT!
Phoenix:
Oh yeah? I THINK I CAN! It's simple!
Edgeworth:
WHAAAAT!?
Phoenix:
Here's my proof. The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is...



Present Maya's Cell Phone







Phoenix:

"I present the defendant's cell phone."




Present anything else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
This! I think...
Judge:
That's not going to prove anything, Mr. Wright. I think...
Phoenix:
W-wait! That was just a warm up!
Judge:
Hmm! Okay, once again. And I expect real proof this time!
Leads back to:
"The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is..."

(Gah! She's saying exactly what Edgeworth wants her to say.) Miss May. You were tapping the victim's phone! I hardly call that "irrelevant"!
Judge:
While this court does not condone the defense's tone of voice, he has a point. (Changed from [While this court does not condone the defense's tone of speech, he has a point.] in the original release) Well, Miss May? Do you have an explanation for the court? Can you prove you had nothing to do with this murder, even though you tapped her phone?
April:
At the time of the murder... I was in my hotel room, getting room service! How could I have killed her? If you don't believe me, just ask the bellboy!
Leads to:
"Well, does the defense have anything to say?"





Present anything else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
This evidence reveals the truth of the matter!
Judge:
What does it reveal, exactly?
Edgeworth:
The mad delusions of the defense, perhaps?
Phoenix:
(Uh oh, bad reaction. Maybe that wasn't the thing...)
Judge:
I'm afraid it has revealed a certain over-eagerness... Let me ask again:
Leads back to:
"How did the witness know "The Thinker" was a clock?"You had heard about it







Phoenix:
The witness had never held the clock in her hand! However, she had heard that it was a clock!
Judge:
She "heard"...?
Phoenix:
That is correct, Your Honor. There is no other way she could have known "The Thinker" was a clock! And I can show you the proof!
Judge:
Well, this is interesting. Let's see it, then. Show me evidence proving that the witness had "heard" the murder weapon was a clock.



Present Maya's Cell Phone







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
The defendant's cell phone.
Judge:
Yes, we've seen that already.
Phoenix:
Take another listen to the conversation between the defendant and victim.
Cellular:

*beep*
...

Maya:
[Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while.]
Mia:
[Well, actually there's something I want you to hold on to for me.]
Maya:
[Again? What's it this time?]
Mia:
[It's... a clock. It's made to look like that statue, "The Thinker." And it tells you the time!]

...

Judge:
They do mention "The Thinker." But how would the witness know of this conversation? Do you have proof that she knew of the conversation?



Present Wiretap







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Have a look at this."




Present anything else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
(Wait... no, this can't be right! I can't afford any mistakes now!)
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Your evidence, please!
Leads back to:
"Do you have proof that she knew of the conversation?"


Phoenix:
Have a look at this.
April:
Ah! Oooh! Th-that!? Eh heh...
Phoenix:
I found this in Miss May's room.
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Please explain to the court what this is!
Phoenix:
Miss April May! You used a wiretap to listen to this conversation! That's how you knew "The Thinker" was a clock! Am I wrong!?
April:
I... I...
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Your Honor, this is ridiculous!
Phoenix:
Your Honor, look at the witness's face? Does she seem amused to you!? The defense demands an answer.
April:
La... laaa... lrrrrgf!
Judge:
Witness, answer the question. Did you tap her phone?
April:
...
Judge:
Miss May!
April:
Shut up, all of you! What gives you the right to talk to ME like that! You... you LAWYER!
......
April:
I-it's no fair! All of you g-ganging up on me like that... Oh, so I'm the bad girl, is that it? Is that it!? Uh... uh... uwaaaaaaah!
Phoenix:
(That did it! The court's seen the real Miss April May now! Now to deal the final blow!)



You did it, didn't you?







Phoenix:
Miss May!
April:
What is it you little shrimp! Talk to me in that tone of voice will you!?
Phoenix:
You killed her, didn't you!
Judge:
Order! There will be order!
April:
What? How can you possibly say that!? Are you mad? A-all I did was a little wiretap... Oops!
Phoenix:
So you admit you tapped her phone!
April:
Heh... heh... hrrah! B-but wait! I didn't do ANYTHING bad like murder! I'm a good girl!
Phoenix:
Really? Can you prove it!? (No way can she prove it!)
April:
You think you're so smart, Mr. Lawyer... But I can prove it! And I will!
Phoenix:
You can't be serious! No way!
April:
Way, I say! Way! Oh, and I assure you I'm serious, Mr. Lawyer! Hmph! Okay? So, the killing happened around 9:00 at night? Why, that's just when I was getting room service from that sweet bellboy...
Phoenix:
R-room service!?
April:
Ice coffee, I believe it was? Ice coffee? You know? Like normal coffee, but COLD. If you don't drink it quick, the ice melts and then you have... regular cold coffee.
Phoenix:
I-ice coffee...!?
April:
Think I'm making this up? Ask the bellboy! *wink*
Edgeworth:
Ergo, the witness was not on the scene at the time of the murder!
Phoenix:
!
Judge:
So, where does that leave us...?
Edgeworth:
It is my great displeasure to inform you... That the witness appears to have been tapping the victim's telephone. However! That is a separate crime, with no bearing on the current case whatsoever! Her testimony stands! She saw the defendant, Maya Fey, commit murder!
Phoenix:
(No! They're going to let her just walk away! There's no way I can win this unless I tie Miss May to the murder somehow...)
Leads to:
"Well, does the defense have anything to say?"




Why the wiretap?







Phoenix:

April:

Phoenix:
(Hah! I'd like to see her pull THAT off!)
April:
Mr. Lawyer, I saw that evil, evil grin! You were probably thinking "I'd like to see her pull THAT off," weren't you!
Phoenix:
(Damn... she's good!)
April:
Well you're not the first man who's thought that! And of course... I can, and will!
Phoenix:
You can't be serious! No way!

Present Wiretap







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Have a look at this.
April:
Ah! Oooh! Th-that!? Eh heh...
Phoenix:
I found this in Miss May's room.
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Please explain to the court what this is!
Phoenix:
Miss April May? You were tapping the victim, Ms. Mia Fey's phone, were you not?
April:
Oooh. Oooooh!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Your Honor, This is irrelevant!
Judge:
I'm not entirely sure that it is. Objection overruled. It troubles me that our witness was in possession of a wiretap.
Edgeworth:
This is outrageous! Does the defense truly claim that the witness was tapping her phone?
Phoenix:
Absolutely!
Edgeworth:
Even if that was the case, (which it's not) you still have to prove one thing! Did the victim ever say that the weapon was a clock on the phone? Can you prove that? I THINK NOT!
Phoenix:
Oh yeah? I THINK I CAN! It's simple!
Edgeworth:
WHAAAAT!?
Phoenix:
Here's my proof. The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is...



Present Maya's Cell Phone







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"I present the defendant's cell phone."




Present anything else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
This! I think...
Judge:
That's not going to prove anything, Mr. Wright. I think...
Phoenix:
W-wait! That was just a warm up!
Judge:
Hmm! Okay, once again. And I expect real proof this time!
Leads back to:
"The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is..."


Phoenix:
I present the defendant's cell phone.

Yes, we've seen that.

Present anything else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
This is my evidence!
Judge:
I'm afraid I'm not sure where you are going with all of this, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Um... "where"? Well, it's not so much a place as a... er...
Edgeworth:
Come to the end of your bluff, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
W-wait! Wait! That was, uh, practice! Here's the real evidence!
Judge:
Mr. Wright, this court does not condone the presentation of evidence for "practice." Let's see your evidence, for real this time, Mr. Wright.
Leads back to:
"Show me evidence proving that the witness had "heard" the murder weapon was a clock."Judge:
Well, does the defense have anything to say?Phoenix:
Um, well... (Come on, think of something!)Call the bellboy as a witness







Phoenix:
The defense would like to call the hotel bellboy as a witness! There's something suspicious there, and I'm going to get to the bottom of it!
April:
I think you've sunken quite low enough already.
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
I object to calling the bellboy!
Phoenix:
W-why? What's your reason?
Edgeworth:
Because I hold that the wiretapping had nothing to do with the killing!
Phoenix:
...!
Edgeworth:
However... If you agree to one condition, I'll consent to calling this witness.
Phoenix:
Condition...?
Edgeworth:
If Miss April May's alibi is not called into question after you examine the bellboy... Then you will recognize that Miss April May was not the killer, thus she is innocent! Therefore you must accept the verdict of "guilty" for Ms. Maya Fey! That is my condition.
Phoenix:
(What...!? I'd better find something suspicious in that bellboy's testimony... Otherwise Maya will be declared "guilty" on the spot! What should I do...?)



Accept the condition







Phoenix:
(Alright! I've got nothing to lose! Except for... well, everything!) Understood. I accept your condition.
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Fool... You fell right into my trap!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh!) Uh... um, wait...
Leads to:
"Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand!"




Give up







Phoenix:
(Grr! I can't accept those conditions!) Very well. The defense will refrain from calling the bellboy as a witness.
Judge:
I see. You may continue your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Right. On with the cross-examination.
Edgeworth:
What exactly do you have left to examine, Mr. Wright? Miss April May has admitted to the wiretap, yes. But that bears no relevance to the case at hand: murder! There's no way you can prove any connection!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh! Think! This can't be the end... but I'm out of evidence!)
Judge:
Then I believe the cross-examination is over. Mr. Edgeworth, does the prosecution have any other witnesses to call?
Edgeworth:
None, Your Honor. She's the last.
Phoenix:
(What!? B-but that means... Maya's guilty...!?) W-wait! Your Honor!
Judge:
Yes, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
The defense would like to call the bellboy after all!
Edgeworth:
... Tsk tsk tsk... As I thought!
Phoenix:
...?
Edgeworth:
May I remind you, dear Mr. Wright. Should you question the bellboy... and Miss April May's alibi prove to be solid... then, by default, your client Ms. Maya Fey will be pronounced "guilty"! Are you prepared to accept my condition?
Phoenix:
(Edgeworth... He's got me backed into a corner... But I don't see any other way to take this!) I accept!
Leads to:
"Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand!"Continue examining Miss May







Phoenix:
Right. On with the cross-examination.
Edgeworth:
What exactly do you have left to examine, Mr. Wright? Miss April May has admitted to the wiretap, yes. But that bears no relevance to the case at hand: murder! There's no way you can prove any connection!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh! Think! This can't be the end... but I'm out of evidence!)

Yes, sir. I received your summons in the middle of work, sir. I'm happy to be of service.Judge:

Very good, sir!Witness Testimony-- Miss May's Room Service --Bellboy:
I am the head bellboy at the fine Gatewater Hotel, in business for four generations!
I believe I received a call after 8:00 in the evening from our guest, Miss May.
She asked for an ice coffee to be brought to her at 9:00, on the dot, sir.
I brought it to her at precisely the requested time, of course.
And I delivered the ice coffee to our guest Miss May, herself.Judge:
I see. The defense may begin its cross-examination.Phoenix:
R-right! I'm ready. (I hope... This is it... If I can't prove Miss May was involved with the murder now... Maya will be finished!)Cross Examination-- Miss May's Room Service --Bellboy:

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What exactly is it you do at the hotel?
Bellboy:
Why, anything required of me, sir. I check in guests, I check out guests. I clean rooms, I make beds. I even deliver room service, sir. I checked Miss May in personally.
Phoenix:
Are you always so... so prim?
Judge:
Mr. Wright. You will refrain from asking frivolous questions...Bellboy:

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Are you sure it was Miss May on the phone?
Bellboy:
Absolutely, sir.
Phoenix:
H-how can you be so certain!?
Bellboy:
I checked Miss May in personally, sir. Not only did I see her in all her stunning radiance, but I also heard her voice. And then I saw THEM, and I... Ahem. Er... ahem! The point being, I remembered her quite well, sir.
Judge:
Yes, what then?Bellboy:
She asked for an ice coffee to be brought to her at 9:00, on the dot, sir.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
9:00 "on the dot," you say?
Bellboy:
Yes. I confirmed that detail several times. She was watching a program on the TV, and wished to drink after she finished, sir.

I brought it to her at precisely the requested time, of course.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
"Precisely" 9:00, then?
Bellboy:
Precisely, exactly, and most definitely, sir, 9:00 PM.
Phoenix:
How can you be so sure!?
Bellboy:
Miss May was quite insistent that it be brought then. "Oh, bellboy? Tee hee! I'd like, like, ice coffee at exactly 9:00!" Something like that, sir. Therefore, I knocked on her door at the crack of 9:00, sir.
Phoenix:
(Why would she be so particular about the time?)Bellboy:
And I delivered the ice coffee to our guest Miss May, herself.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
You are sure it was Miss April May herself?
Bellboy:
Ab-SO-lutely, sir.
Phoenix:
"Ab-SO-lutely"...?
Bellboy:
Yes, sir. As in, "so very absolutely," sir. It's an endearing mannerism of mine.
Phoenix:
How come you're so very certain!?
Bellboy:
Well, when I brought the room service, sir... S-she... the guest, sir, favored me w-with a, um, an "embrasser," sir.
Phoenix:
"Embrasser"!? Is that French for "embrace"?
Bellboy:
It's French for "kiss," sir. But not a french kiss, sir! More of a peck on the cheek.
Phoenix:
Wh-why would she have done that...?
Bellboy:
I believe, perhaps, she was momentarily swayed by my prim demeanor, sir. It was a moment I shall never, ever forget, sir.
Phoenix:
(Sounds pretty fishy to me... I think our Miss May was up to something and wanted the bellboy to remember her!)Phoenix:
(This bellboy wouldn't have any reason to lie... But I have to find something to use in his testimony! One more time. I'll press him until he spills the beans... or his tea!)After pressing fourth and fifth statements:Phoenix:

Tsk tsk. Finally, you understand. This bellboy has absolutely no reason to lie! Now... If you have any decency, you will end this rather tedious cross-examination here!Judge:
Hmm. It was a bit tedious. The witness may leave the stand.Phoenix:

Your Honor, I must object. This charade of justice has gone on long enough!Judge:
Now, now, Mr. Edgeworth. Alright Mr. Wright. I'll give you one more question, that's all.Phoenix:
(Okay. This is really it, now. This is my last chance! What do I ask him about...!?)Check-in







Phoenix:
T-tell me about check-in! Tell me about when you checked-in Miss May.
Bellboy:
Oh, alright. Very well, sir. My first thought was that she was a beautiful, beautiful person. She's just my type of girl, so it was a disappointment, really.
Phoenix:
I see... ? Excuse me... what exactly was a "disappointment"?
Bellboy:
Well, I am not without charm, sir, but even I'd have little chance with her lover there.
Phoenix:
(...! What did he say!?) What did you say!?
Bellboy:
Ah! Oh... er... rather, quite!
Phoenix:
Bellboy! Tell us the truth now... Did Miss May check in with another person?
Edgeworth:

Leads to:
"I object! That was... objectionable!"Room service







Phoenix:
T-tell me again about er... room service!
Bellboy:
A-again, sir? At exactly 9:00, I delivered room service to Miss May in room 303. The guest had requested ice coffee... $18 was the charge, as I recall.
Phoenix:
I see... ...? E-eighteen dollars? Doesn't that seem a bit expensive?
Bellboy:
Y-yes, well, ice coffee for two, you know. And we don't skimp on the ice, sir.
Phoenix:
(...! What did he say!?) What did you say!?
Bellboy:
Ah! Oh... er... rather, quite!
Phoenix:
Bellboy! Tell us the truth now... Was someone else staying in Miss May's room?
Edgeworth:

Leads to:
"I object! That was... objectionable!"Bed making







Phoenix:
Bed... bed making! Tell me about making beds that day.
Edgeworth:
I was wondering what you were going to ask, but bed making? A new low!
Judge:
Now, now, Mr. Edgeworth. The witness will answer the defense's question.
Bellboy:
Yes, well, it was quite like any other day's bed making. I changed the sheets, the pillowcases, and then I proceeded to make the bed. I had to bring pillows for two, of course, but they're quite light, you see.
Phoenix:
I see. Thank you. ... (Pillows... for two!?) Bellboy! What did you just say?
Bellboy:
Eh!? Ah, yes, pillows are light... sir?
Phoenix:
Bellboy! Tell us the truth now... Was someone else staying in Miss May's room?
Edgeworth:

Leads to:
"I object! That was... objectionable!"Edgeworth:
I object! That was... objectionable!Judge:
... Objection overruled. The witness will answer the question.Bellboy:
Er... yes, I see.Phoenix:
Why did you not mention this in your testimony!?Bellboy:
W-well, sir, you er... you didn't ask!Phoenix:
(Nice try!) That's the sort of thing you're normally supposed to mention!Bellboy:
Ah, yes, quite. Indeed... It was the, er, good barrister there, Mr. Edgeworth, who...Phoenix:
!Bellboy:
He asked me not to mention it if I wasn't specifically asked, sir.Edgeworth:
Oof! Y-you fool!Phoenix:
I've done it... I've won!Phoenix:
Miss April May checked into a twin room... with a man. Correct?Bellboy:
Yes, sir.Phoenix:
Then, when you brought them room service, you didn't see that man in the room...?Bellboy:
That's right, sir.Judge:
Hmm...Phoenix:
Your Honor! We have just learned of another person involved who may have been the murderer! In light of this new fact, I hold that it's impossible to judge the defendant. (Changed from [In this new light, I hold that it's impossible to judge the defendant.] in the original release) You agree, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:
And who, Mr. Wright! Who is this "other person"! (Changed from [Who! Who is this 'other person'!] in the original release)Phoenix:
Simple, it was...Miss April May







Phoenix:
None other than Miss April May!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Eh!? Have you heard nothing that has transpired so far!? She has an alibi! She was in the hotel at the time of the murder!
Phoenix:
Oh... right.
Judge:
Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
S-sorry, Your Honor! Give me one more chance!
Leads back to:
"Simple, it was..."The man with Miss May







Leads to:
"The man who checked in with Miss May!"The Bellboy







Phoenix:
It was the bellboy and none other!
Judge:
Well, this comes as some surprise...
Edgeworth:
Your Honor, Mr. Wright... It was the bellboy who confirmed Miss May's alibi... And this in turn confirms the bellboy's alibi! He was in the hotel!
Phoenix:
Well, s-sure... if you put it that way...
Edgeworth:
I do put it that way, and I trust you will too!
Phoenix:
But what if they were in cahoots!
Judge:
You have evidence of this?
Phoenix:
Um... no, Your Honor.
Judge:
Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
S-sorry, Your Honor! Give me one more chance!
Leads back to:
"Simple, it was..."Phoenix:
The man who checked in with Miss May!Edgeworth:
Oof!Phoenix:
Your Honor! As has been previously revealed, Miss April May was tapping the victim's phone. Yet Miss May herself has an alibi at the time of the murder. However, that does not clear the man that was with her! The bellboy saw no one else in the room at the time of the murder!!!Edgeworth:
M-my, what a convenient little setup... but it's too late...Phoenix:
"Too late"? I suppose you'd like it if it was too late, wouldn't you... After all, it was you who hid the presence of the other man from this court!Edgeworth:
Oof! Upstart... amateur...! T-these accusations are... ludicrous!Judge:
Enough! The court acknowledges the defense's argument. I expect the prosecution and defense to look into this matter fully! Am I understood?Edgeworth:
Yes... *gasp* Yes, Your Honor.Judge:
That is all today for the trial of Maya Fey. Court is adjourned!September 7, 2:24 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Maya:
Mr. Wright! You were amazing in there!Phoenix:
R-really?Maya:
I think I might be your newest fan!Phoenix:
Oh, I was just "doing my job" you know... heh heh.Maya:
Then again, that other attorney was pretty cool, too...Phoenix:
Huh?Maya:
That face of his! With his eyes wide, and trembling lips! It sent shivers up my spine!Phoenix:
Hmm... if you say so.Maya:
So, what happens with me? Do I get to go home now?Phoenix:
Um, well... (Changed from [Well, no.] in the original release) No, I don't think so. Not yet. (Changed from [I don't think so. Not yet.] in the original release)Maya:
Oh... I see.Phoenix:
But I got a great lead in today's trial!Maya:
A "lead"?Phoenix:
That man with Miss May! He's the key!Maya:
Oh! I get it. What happened to Miss May after that, anyway?Phoenix:
I heard they arrested her. I guess she's learning her charms won't work everywhere. She's probably at the detention center now. I may have to go down there later. Anyway. This case is far from closed.Maya:
Yes sir!Phoenix:
I'm going to find out more about this man.Maya:
Do you think he was the one who...?Phoenix:
Maybe so.Maya:
Sis...Phoenix:
Don't worry, I'll find him by tomorrow. I promise.Maya:
I'm counting on you!Phoenix:
I asked for a full record of April May's testimony. I thought it might come in handy during the trial tomorrow. But now that I have it, I'm not so sure. Most of her testimony was all lies... In fact, there's only one part that hasn't been stricken from the record. (Changed from [In fact, there's only one part that got left on the record.] in the original release)May Testimony added to the Court Record.Phoenix:
I don't know how much good this will do me at all, now. Anyway, time to hit the pavement and do some investigating! Maya doesn't belong in that detention center, and it's up to me to set her free! (Changed from [Maya doesn't belong in that detention center, and it's up to me to get her free!] in the original release)To be continued.Presenting wrong evidence during testimony







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Judge:
...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory.
Phoenix:
Huh? Really?
Judge:
Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)Presenting wrong evidence during testimony







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
Judge:
Uh... I'm not sure I follow?
Phoenix:
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
Judge:
You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)Presenting wrong evidence during testimony







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
How exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...?
Phoenix:
They aren't, are they...
Judge:
Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)Presenting wrong evidence during testimony







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
Judge:
... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Ugh. I must be on the wrong track?)Too many penalties







Judge:
That's enough! This court see no reason to further prolong the trial. The defense has failed to give the court sufficient reason to doubt the prosecution's claim! This court find the defendant, Ms. Maya Fey...

Guilty

Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!Turnabout Sisters

Well hello! I didn't expect anyone to visit me in such a dank place as this... It's really quite... moving. Not! You stinking lawyer! I hope you die! Have you come to laugh? Yes, laugh at the fallen Miss May!Phoenix:
No, not really, there's something I wanted to ask.April:
Unfortunately, there is nothing I want to BE asked. Haven't you done enough questioning, you...! Spiky-head!Phoenix:
(Here we go again...) Please, you're scaring the security guard.April:
... So? What is it you wish to ask of me, then? Hmm?Phoenix:
(For starters, how did you get to be so totally whacked!?)Examine









Security camera







Phoenix:
Smile for the camera...




Security guard







Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch. A real pro, this guy. Or maybe he just doesn't get to see a lot of women like Miss May in here.Talk









That "man"







Phoenix:
About the man who stayed with you in your hotel room...
April:
...
Phoenix:
Can you tell me about him? Where is he? C'mon...
April:
No way, Jose.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... maybe if I had something to get her to talk...)




The wiretap







Phoenix:
Why did you place a wiretap on Mia's phone?
April:
Aww, when you say it like that it sounds so... cold. So criminal!
Phoenix:
Um... tapping people's phones is a crime, Miss May.
April:
Oh, and I suppose you learned that in Lawyer School, hmm? Creep!
Phoenix:
(This woman is impossible to talk to...)




Your attitude







Phoenix:
Say... Why are you so... angry? I mean, you don't look like a bad person...
April:
Ooh, that does it! Bottom-feeding, scum-sucking lawyer!
Phoenix:
B-bottom...? (I can't tell, does she have a thing against lawyers... or just against me?)Present









Anything







April:
Hey, guess what. Actually, I, um, really hate your guts. So get lost. Because, well, I'm not cooperating.
Phoenix:
(Thanks, I noticed.)September 7Fey & Co. Law OfficesPhoenix:
Looks like forensics is taking the day off today. Detective Gumshoe's nowhere in sight. The police really gave this place a working over. I doubt there are any valuable clues left. Suppose it can't hurt to take a look around, though.Examine









Bookshelf







Phoenix:
You couldn't cram more legal books in here, even if you wanted to. All the cases that the chief worked on are filed here. Hmm. Are some of the files missing...? Nah, I'm imagining things.September 7Grossberg Law OfficesPhoenix:
(Huh. Looks like Grossberg is out today... again. Maybe he's avoiding me for some reason?)Examine









Photos on desk







Phoenix:
What's this? Old photos? There are two lying here. Something's been written in pencil on the backs. "DL-6 Incident - Exhibit A," "DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B"... Let's take a look at these...



"DL-6 Incident - Exhibit A"







Phoenix:
... I'm sure I've seen this person somewhere... Perhaps I'll borrow this photo. I'm sure no one will miss just one little photo. And it might be a valuable clue... I'll take it for now.
Photograph quietly added to the Court Record.
Leads back to examination




"DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B"







Phoenix:
Why would Grossberg have a picture of this man...? This might be a valuable clue... I'll take it for now. I'm just borrowing it. I'll return it later.
Photograph quietly added to the Court Record.
Leads back to examination




Leave them alone







Phoenix:
I don't need it now, whatever it is. If I ever run out of clues, I'll know where to find these. (Although I can't be sure the photos will still be here then...)
Leads back to examination





Photos on desk (after one has been added to the Court Record)







Phoenix:
A photo lies on the desk. Maybe I should switch it with the one I took?



Swap photos







Phoenix:
I think I'll swap them...
Photograph added to the Court Record.
Leads back to examination




Leave it alone







Phoenix:
No, on second thought, I'd better not.
Leads back to examination





Vacant wall







Phoenix:
Wait a second... Wasn't there a giant painting hanging on that wall...? Yeah... yeah, it was a painting of...



Sunflowers







Leads to:
"Wasn't it? It wasn't a very memorable painting, anyhow."




Marvin Grossberg







Leads to:
"Wasn't it? It wasn't a very memorable painting, anyhow."




Fishermen







Leads to:
"Wasn't it? It wasn't a very memorable painting, anyhow."


Phoenix:
Wasn't it? It wasn't a very memorable painting, anyhow.Detention Center (after visiting Grossberg Law Offices)April:
YOU AGAIN!? Can't you take a hint and stay gone?Phoenix:
Hey, the only reason I'm back here is because YOU won't talk to me!April:
Oh, so it's MY fault now? You don't just have spiky hair, you also have a spiky heart.Phoenix:
(That does it. When this case is done I'm shaving my head.)Talk









That "man"







Phoenix:
About the man who stayed with you in your hotel room... Can you tell me about him? Where is he?
April:
I'm not telling!
Phoenix:
Look, he's being accused of murder! I don't think you want to be protecting him.
April:
Hmm. Would you have sold out the late Ms. Fey to the cops?
Phoenix:
No.
April:
See?
Phoenix:
(Damn! Hmm... maybe if I had something to get her to talk...)Present









Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit A)







Phoenix:
Any thoughts about this photograph?
April:
... Who's that? Your mother?
Phoenix:
(... *sigh* Looks like I've just been wasting my time.)




Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B)







Phoenix:
Have a look at this.
April:
Look, I've said several times, I'm not telling you... ! Where did you...?
Phoenix:
(Ah hah! A reaction!) This is him, isn't it?
April:
What? Who? When? Why...?
Phoenix:
It IS him. This is the man who stayed in your hotel room the night of the murder!
April:
No! No, that's not right.
Phoenix:
(Nice try, Miss Cooperative.)
April:
D-do you have proof that was him? Hmm? Y-yeah! Proof! Show me proof!
Phoenix:
(I'm so close!)September 7Gatewater HotelRoom 303Bellboy:
Ah, welcome, sir! Quite the performance today, if I dare say so myself.Phoenix:
Oh, um, thanks. Sorry for putting you on the spot like that.Bellboy:
No, no, not at all, sir! Your efforts today can only help the Gatewater's "rep," as they say.Phoenix:
Huh? "Rep"?Bellboy:
Yes! Our reputation will swell as the hotel where the murderer used a wiretap! We can charge a premium for the room, of course. It will be great for business, sir!Phoenix:
Whoa, whoa! Miss May hasn't been charged with murder.Bellboy:
I, too, will become famous! "The Bellboy who brought the murderer ice coffee"...!Phoenix:
(Why do I feel like we're both stuck in the same bad dream...)Bellboy:
So! You are our honored guest. Please let me know if there is anything I can bring you!Examine









Flowers







Phoenix:
A vase, as expected. I'm not good with flower names, except maybe tulips and sunflowers.




Open drawer







Phoenix:
Huh? There's still a screwdriver stuck in that drawer!
Bellboy:
Ah, please leave that as it is, sir. That's the "Drawer of Terror, Hiding Place of the Murderer's Wiretap." It's set to become one of the most popular attractions here.
Phoenix:
(This guy's serious! I don't believe it...)




Table







Phoenix:
A bottle and two glasses rest on the table. Why hasn't he cleaned these up by now?
Bellboy:
Ah, I beg your pardon, sir, but if you could please refrain from touching those... It's part of the decor. I call it: "The last drink... before murder!" We'll be famous! The talk of the hotel industry!




Window







Phoenix:
Nice weather again today. I can see the Fey & Co. Law Offices, of course.
Bellboy:
Ah, yes. We plan to install a telescope in that window, of course. Just $5.00 will earn you three minutes of a "view to a kill"!
Phoenix:
...
Bellboy:
J-just kidding, sir. Oh hoh hoh hoh!
Phoenix:
(By that look in his eyes I'd say he was more than serious...)Talk









Miss May







Phoenix:
About Miss May...
Bellboy:
Oh, her? Sir, not to boast but I knew the moment I saw her... "She'd do it!" I said!
Phoenix:
(Do WHAT!? I'm starting to think the most suspicious person here is this guy!)




The man with May







Phoenix:
I wanted to ask you about the man who was with Miss May...?
Bellboy:
Ah, yes... He struck me as a real "Lady Killer," if you'll pardon the expression. I knew it from the moment I saw him, sir. He and I are of the same ilk. We both carry the scent of... danger.
Phoenix:
(There we are in total agreement, Mr. Psycho Bellboy.)
Bellboy:
If you had a photo of that man, I'm quite sure I could identify him.
Phoenix:
(A photo. Hmm...)




The hotel







Phoenix:
Could you tell me about this hotel?
Bellboy:
Absolutely! And on that subject, I have an excellent idea, sir! Currently, this hotel is known as the "Gatewater." I propose that we add a subtitle!
Phoenix:
A subtitle!?
Bellboy:

The Gatewater Hotel -- Murder Manor --
Well? What do you think?
Phoenix:
Um... sounds great! (Whatever floats your tea set...)Present









Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit A)







Phoenix:
What about this photo?
Bellboy:
Well, it's a fine photo, sir. However, the person Miss May was accompanied by was, well, a man.
Phoenix:
(Oh... yeah. Right.)




Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B)







Phoenix:
Take a look at this photo.
Bellboy:
... That's him, Detective.
Phoenix:
Um... I'm the lawyer.
Bellboy:
Oh, I know that! I just wanted to say "Detective" once. You know how it is.
Phoenix:
(No. No I don't.)
Bellboy:
Without a doubt, that is the man who checked in with Miss April May. How about I write an affidavit swearing that that's him!
Phoenix:
An affidavit? (This guy is way too excited about this...)



Have him write it







Phoenix:
Well, sure. Why not?
Bellboy:
Yes! I've always wanted to write an affidavit, sir. From hence forth I will be known as "The Bellboy who swore the affidavit"! (Changed from [From hence forth I will be known as the 'bellboy who swore the affidavit'!] in the original release)
Phoenix:
Just hurry up and write it.
Bellboy's Affidavit added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(Not even Miss May can play dumb to this!)
Leads back to Court Record




Turn him down







Phoenix:
Well thanks, but I don't think that will be necessary.
Bellboy:
Oh? Oh, I see. Well later then, if you need it.
Leads back to Court Record





Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B) (after Bellboy's Affidavit is added to the Court Record)







Phoenix:
Sorry to press the matter, but are you sure this is him?
Bellboy:
I, too, am sorry to press the matter, but that is him, Detective!
Phoenix:
Umm... thanks.




Bellboy's Affidavit







Phoenix:
Thanks for this.
Bellboy:
No no no, not at all, sir! I hope you'll use it to take that Miss May down hard, sir! Hard!
Phoenix:
(Why do I sense an unhealthy level of excitement behind that unchanging smile? His tea set is rattling!)




Anything else







Bellboy:
I'm sorry... All I could think about during the trial was the hotel... I wasn't paying much attention to the evidence.Grossberg Law Offices (after Bellboy's Affidavit is added to the Court Record)Phoenix:
(*sigh* He's out again? Huh? No more photos on the desk...)Detention CenterPresent









Bellboy's Affidavit







Phoenix:
Could you have a look at this?
April:
What's that?
Phoenix:
The bellboy's affidavit! He told us everything he saw. He told us about the man you checked in with. He told us who he was.
April:
...!
Phoenix:
(Now I'm getting somewhere!)



Ease her fears







Phoenix:
(Okay, okay... she's vulnerable now. I should be gentle.) Miss May... It would be easy for me to hand this affidavit to the police.
April:
...
Phoenix:
If they get involved, wouldn't your boss be even more... er... inconvenienced? All I want to do is have a little chat with him. You won't tell me?
April:
... Is that all you have to say?
Phoenix:
Yes.
April:
Id it's so easy for you to "get the police involved," then why don't you? Somehow I think you're not up to it, hmm?
Phoenix:
(Show them a little kindness and they jump all over you! That had the opposite effect to what I hoped...)
April:
Aww. *smirk* Poor little lawyer... And you were so close!
Phoenix:
(This isn't working... I think I've worn out this piece of paper's usefulness.) Dammit!
Bellboy's Affidavit discarded. (Changed from [Discarded the Bellboy's Affidavit.] in the original release)
Phoenix:
(The man in this photo is the one I want! Why did April May not want to talk about it... she must know him!)
Leads back to Court Record




Push her hard







Phoenix:
(This is it, all or nothing! Time to do a little bluff.) No use playing dumb! (If, indeed, that's an act.) If you don't talk, I'm taking this photo to the press!
April:
Whaaaaat!?
Phoenix:
Even though he should've been witness to murder, your little "friend" is missing. (Changed from [Even though he should be a witness to murder, this man is in hiding.] in the original release) I'm sure the press would have a field day with his reputation!
April:
...! Ooooh! Fine! I'll talk! You... you win, Lawyer.
Phoenix:
(Yes! Man, that felt good! It's great to be alive!)
April:
Why are you pumping your fists in the air?
Phoenix:
*cough* Now, tell me about the man you were with.
April:
That man... He's my boss. Redd White, the president of the information gathering conglomerate, Bluecorp.
Phoenix:
(Redd... White?) "Information gathering?"
April:
Well... I suppose you could call it a detective agency. (Changed from [Well... I suppose you could call them a detective agency.] in the orignal release)
Phoenix:
Hmm... So this is the man that was with you the night of the murder?
April:
... I'm... I'm scared to talk. I don't want to end up like her!
Phoenix:
(...!) It's okay, I'll just ask Mr. White himself. Can you tell me where Bluecorp is located?
April:
...
Phoenix:
(Mr. Redd White, at last! Finally, a lead on this guy! If April May couldn't have done it, that leaves him! Time to take action!)

I... It was all a bit too much for me, my boy. Seeing you today, I... well, I... ...Phoenix:
(I appreciate the reminiscing, but I'd much rather you gave me some information!)Talk









Today's trial







Phoenix:
So you came to see the trial?
Grossberg:
Yes, yes I did. Something was bothering me all last night, you see. I couldn't get a wink of sleep.
Phoenix:
Really? What was that?
Grossberg:
Well, you see, it's just... Mia's sister, that poor girl. My boy, I owe you my thanks, truly. I don't know what I would have done if things had gone poorly for the girl.
Phoenix:
(If you were that worried about it, why didn't you offer to defend her!?)




Your refusal







Phoenix:
I asked before, but, why did you refuse her request for defense? I think I have a right to know.
Grossberg:
A right, Mr. Wright? No, no, I'm sorry. It's just, I need more time to think about it, my boy.
Phoenix:
... (He does seem troubled about something... Maybe I can find something that will inspire him to talk.)




That painting







Phoenix:
The other day I'm sure there was a big, pretentious-looking painting on that wall...
Grossberg:
"Pretentious-looking"...?
Phoenix:
Well... you know the one I mean. Anyway, where did it go?
Grossberg:
Ah, yes, well... I... got rid of it. Got quite tired of the thing, really. I, er, sold it, you see. Yes, that's right.
Phoenix:
(Sold it!? I'm not sure I buy that...) Wasn't that painting rather important to you, sir? Did something happen?
Grossberg:
I don't see how it's any of your business! Please, speak no more of that accursed painting. I didn't... I... *mumble* *mumble*




Any option (after presenting Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B))







Phoenix:
Mr. Grossberg...?
Grossberg:
... Ah, my apologies. I need to think about things. Alone.
Phoenix:

Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B) (if "Ease her fears" was selected upon presenting Bellboy's Affidavit in Detention Center - Visitor's Room)







Phoenix:
Excuse me, I was wondering about this photograph...
Grossberg:
...! Where did you get that!?
Phoenix:
I borrowed it.
Grossberg:
Well, give it back at once!
Phoenix:
Mr. Grossberg. Tell me about the man in this photo. He may have been in that hotel room with April May on the night of the murder. Do you know something about him... anything?
Grossberg:
...! Hmm. Ahem! Very well. I'll tell you what I know. However... You didn't hear it from me, if you follow.
Phoenix:
I follow.
Grossberg:
That man is Mr. Redd White. He's the President of Bluecorp.
Phoenix:
(Redd White... Hmm.) Bluecorp... they're something like a detective agency, right?
Grossberg:
They're information pros. They sell information, you see. Sensitive information. Despite his name, Mr. White has the blackest reputation of any man in this country. Should you run across him, watch what you say. You wouldn't want him digging up any dirt on you.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... selling information. Sounds like blackmail.) Can you tell me where Bluecorp is located?
Grossberg:
Hmm... I suppose.
Phoenix:
(Mr. Redd White, at last! Finally, a lead on this guy! Even if April May couldn't have done it, he could have! Time to take action!)
Returned photograph to Mr. Grossberg.
Grossberg:
Now, I must ask you to leave. I need to think about things. Alone.

Phoenix:
Excuse me, I was wondering about this photograph...
Grossberg:
Where did you get that!? Give it back at once!
Phoenix:
I'm sorry to have taken it without your knowledge. But... I have to know. Who is this man? He was most likely in April May's room the night of the murder.
Grossberg:
! What's that you say!? A-are you QUITE sure? My boy?
Phoenix:
(What has him so flustered I wonder...?)
Grossberg:
I... I beg your pardon, but I must ask you to leave. I need to be alone.
Phoenix:

A statue of a man holding up the world. The "Bluecorp" sign certainly stands out enough... The model for the man is, of course, Mr. White.
White:
Truly a work of art! But, probably to beautacious for you to appreciate, correct?
Phoenix:
(I think it's a little too "beautacious" for just about anyone to appreciate.)




Trophy display







Phoenix:
An impressive line-up of trophies. "Judges Special Runner-up" "Best Participation" "Judges Cooperation Award" "Special Good Try Prize" Hmm. The words "Judges" and "Special" kind of stand out.




Window







Phoenix:
This is the top floor of a 20-story building. The view is quite... presidential.Talk









Miss May







Phoenix:
Miss May is an employee of Bluecorp, is she not?
White:
Correct. She was my secretariat. What a shock it was to hear what she has done!
Phoenix:
"What she has done"... You mean the wiretap?
White:
Indeed! She is paid to answer phones. Tapping them is NOT in her job description. She does gather information for us as part of her duties. But, I assure you, we do not condone illegal methods! It is ineffable that she would do this.
Phoenix:
(It sounds like he's trying to turn Miss May into a scapegoat...)




Night of the murder







Phoenix:
On the night of the murder were you in April May's hotel room?
White:
Who can say? I seldom pay attention to mundane details such as time and place. My motto is: "Don't worry, be happy!"
Phoenix:
Still, Mr. White... The hotel bellboy has stated on the record that he does remember you very clearly.
White:
... No matter! The bellboy can say what he pleases. I still won't talk to you. If you want me to speak, put me on the witness stand! Although I doubt you'd be capable of doing that.
Phoenix:
(Hmm. He raises a good question, actually... Why didn't prosecution call him as a witness? He should have "seen" the same thing as April May!)
White:
Oh hoh hoh. The police... the courts... To me they are mere toys. Playthings for my amusement!




Bluecorp







Phoenix:
What kind of company is Bluecorp, anyway?
White:
Ah, excellent question! We buy and sell various kinds of information. We are a company of the future! You might say, we ARE the future!
Phoenix:
(Sell... information?)
White:
In just 10 years, I've built this business up into the grand office you see now. Ah, in case you were wondering, Bluecorp was named after the color "blue"! I, Redd White of Bluecorp, as founder and CEO, named it so! And why, you ask? Because I like the color blue of course! Fantabulistic, is it not?




That painting (appears after "Miss May" and "Night of the murder")







Phoenix:
Uh... there's something that's been bothering me.
White:
Yes? What might that be?
Phoenix:
That big painting on the wall over there...



It's gorgeous







Phoenix:
It's a very striking piece of art.
White:
Magnificentatious, isn't it!
Phoenix:
Yeah. ... (Why am I making small talk...?)

I've seen it before







Phoenix:
You know, I've actually seen that painting before.
White:
Oh?
Phoenix:
Just yesterday, actually.
White:

Phoenix:
My point is simple. Er, rather, my question is simple: Why is that painting hanging on your wall?
Leads to:

When did you get it?







Phoenix:
Say, when did you get that painting?

I've seen that painting before. Yesterday, in fact. Why do I find that painting here today?

Wiretap







Phoenix:
About this wiretap...
White:
Ah, the one that Miss May used, right? Bad girl. Bad, bad girl.
Phoenix:
She testified that she placed the wiretap at your request.
White:
How pathetic. I guess she's trying to pass the buck. Bad, bad girl. Sorry I can't help you. I know nothing.
Phoenix:
(I'm going to need hard evidence to get anything out of this guy...)




Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B)







Phoenix:
About this picture...
White:
Gorgeous! That's a picture of me! Ah, I see it was taken in the prime of my youth. About 10 years ago, at a guess.
Phoenix:
The hotel bellboy says he saw this man on the night of the murder.
White:
... On closer inspection, he does look a lot like me, but I'm afraid this is someone else. Nope. That's definitely not me. He's far too young.




Anything else

Well, Mr. Lawyer. What will you do, eh? Charge me with assault? Charge away, I welcome it! For it is YOU who will be found guilty!Phoenix:
What...?White:
Heed my exposition! The police, the courts, they all do my bidding.Phoenix:
(So you say... But I wonder... Is that kind of control really possible?)White:
I don't expect you to understand. It is a world beyond your compensation. ... You came here from Grodyburger's, I presume?Phoenix:
Mr. Grossberg's... yes.White:
Then you must ask him: Why is it that this painting of his hangs here? Perhaps then he will tell you? Perhaps he will explain how a man can live life purely for personal profit! ... Go now! Skedaddle! There is nothing more to discuss!Examine

Phoenix:
I'm guessing this is supposed to be a desk? My my... This is quite the... thing.

Today's trial







Phoenix:
So you came to see the trial?
Grossberg:
Yes, yes I did. Something was bothering me all last night, you see, couldn't get a wink of sleep.
Phoenix:
Really? What was that?
Grossberg:
Well, you see, it's just... Mia's sister, that poor girl. My boy, I owe you my thanks, truly. I don't know what I would have done if things had gone poorly for the girl.




Your refusal







Phoenix:
I asked before, but, why did you refuse her request for defense? I think I have a right to know.
Grossberg:
A right, Mr. Wright? No, no, I'm sorry. It's just, I need more time to think about it, my boy.
Phoenix:

Mr. White







Phoenix:
So, I paid Bluecorp a visit.
Grossberg:
Oh? Oh, I see.

Mr. Grossberg... I have to admit, something has been bothering me.
Grossberg:
Oh? What is it? Well, out with it, my boy!

You see, it's just...



That big painting







Phoenix:
Mr. Grossberg, sir... There was a giant painting hanging right there the other day, was there not? The one you said you had "no intention of parting with"? Well, I saw it. Today. It was in the CEO's office at Bluecorp. Redd White's office.
Grossberg:
... So... you noticed. I suppose I should have guessed you would. It is a large painting...
Phoenix:
Mr. Grossberg, I know you and Mr. White are connected somehow!
Grossberg:
C-connected, you say?

Yes! And I know what it is...

Sorry, my boy. I don't think I can help you with that.Grossberg:
Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation. Bluecorp is a company that excels in finding people's weaknesses, I'm afraid. I've been paying them for 15 years now...Phoenix:

It is hard for me to tell you this, my boy. But arresting Redd White will be nigh on impossible.Phoenix:
Impossible? Why!?Grossberg:
He has information on everyone. It gives him an iron grip! He owns judges, attorneys, prosecutors, police... and politicians.Phoenix:

They are bound, unable to do harm to themselves, and therefore, to him. Don't look at me like that. What you see is nothing more than the weight of many years.Talk









The DL-6 Incident







Phoenix:
What is the "DL-6 Incident"?
Grossberg:
"DL-6" is nothing more than the sorting code the police gave the case. It was 15 years ago now... I received a request from a medium. A spirit medium.
Phoenix:
(A medium...?)
Grossberg:
Her name was Misty Fey.
Phoenix:
(Fey!)
Grossberg:
Indeed. She was Mia's mother. She had been investigating a murder at the bequest of the police. And... she failed. As a result, the police called her a fraud.
Phoenix:
(This is what Maya was talking about the other day!)
Grossberg:
I did all I could for her, and in the end, cleared her of wrongdoing. That murder case, however remains unsolved to this day. That case, is the DL-6 Incident.




Reason for blackmail







Phoenix:
But why were you blackmailed over this, Mr. Grossberg?
Grossberg:
The DL-6 Incident was top-secret at the time. It made sense. The police didn't want people to know they were using a medium! They couldn't let people know. But one person found out. I... I told him.
Phoenix:
You told White?
Grossberg:
He offered me riches... It is an embarrassment to me now. Because I talked, the police were mocked far and wide. In secret, they began looking for the one who sold them out. Of course White heard about it, and he came to me. Only this time, the offer was blackmail.
Phoenix:
... I see.
Grossberg:
... White controls the law of this country as he sees fit. Yet if you would still challenge him... Have a close look at Mia's office.
Phoenix:
Mia's office...?
Grossberg:
She followed his every move for years. She may have recorded something of what she found.Fey & Co. Law Offices (after clearing "Reason for blackmail" Talk option in Grossberg Law Offices)Phoenix:
It's funny, looking at this room, it seems... so normal. Hard to imagine a murder took place here. Mr. Grossberg said there would be clues... Maybe I should have another look.Examine

Read it







Mia:
"'I have tarnished the Fey name.' Leaving only these words, my mother vanished. I was determined to find the ones who had made my mother blame herself in this way. Using the E.S.P. that runs in my family, I held an audience with the dead. Finally, the names of two men surfaced. One was Marvin Grossberg, a lawyer who sold my mother's information for riches. The other was the man who sold that information to the press. This parasite, who makes his fortune on threats and coercion... His name is..."

Alright!
Phoenix:
Huh?
Maya:
Oh, I'd better go get a hacksaw while the stores are still open. Oh, oh! And a rope ladder, and a getaway car! Can you drive?

... W-wait. Wait wait wait.Maya:
What what what?Phoenix:
I'm kidding! It was a joke!Maya:
No way!Phoenix:
No really, I was kidding. But thanks. It's good to know you're on my side. (And there really isn't anything you can do for me anyway...)Maya:
But... but I can't just sit here and do nothing! I've got to give that man a piece of my mind!Phoenix:
(Just a piece...?) Okay. Then, come to the court tomorrow.Maya:
O-okay! I'll be there! I'll show them a thing or two!Phoenix:
Times may change, yet with crime it's the same old story. (Changed from [It's the beginning of a new century, yet with crime it's the same old story.] in the original release) In fact, it's gotten worse. Lengthy court proceedings are no longer realistic. Beginning a few years ago, a limit of three days was put on initial court trials. Almost all finish in a day. Most with a guilty verdict. I never thought I would end up in the defendant's chair myself for this case. (Changed from [I never thought I would end up in the defendant's chair myself.] in the original release) With the true culprit appearing as the star witness.

Part 4September 9, 9:52 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Maya:
Well... I guess this is it!Phoenix:
Yeah. One way or another, this case gets decided today.Maya:
Aaa! Ph-Phoenix! Look!Phoenix:
(...! Prosecutor... Edgeworth.)Edgeworth:
I received a call from the public prosecutor's office yesterday.Phoenix:
?Edgeworth:
He told me that whatever Mr. White says today, it will be the "absolute truth." No matter how you try to attack his testimony... If I raise an objection, I have it on good faith that the judge will listen to me.Phoenix:
(What, does White have the judge in his pocket, too!?) So... you're saying I'm going to be guilty. End of story?Edgeworth:
... I will do anything to get my verdict, Mr. Wright. Anything.Maya:
Why... Why!? How can you torment an innocent person like this!?Edgeworth:
"Innocent"...? How can we know that? The guilty will always lie, to avoid being found out. There's no way to tell who is guilty and who is innocent! All that I can hope to do is get every defendant declared "guilty"! So I make that my policy.Phoenix:
Edgeworth... You've changed.Maya:
Hmm? Phoenix! You know him!?Edgeworth:
Don't expect any special treatment, Phoenix Wright.Maya:
Ph-Phoenix...?Phoenix:
Well... court will be starting soon. (Changed from [Well... court will be opening for session soon.] in the original release)Maya:
What? But wait! Your defense attorney isn't even here yet! They're not... (Changed from [Your defense attorney isn't even here yet! He's not...] in the original release)Phoenix:
I'll be defending myself.Maya:
Whaaaat!?Phoenix:
Okay, let's do this.September 9, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 1Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Phoenix Wright.Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:
Mr. Wright... Are you sure you're up to doing this?Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. I will be defending myself.Judge:
Understood. Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth:
As the details of the event are already quite clear to the court, today we will hear the testimony of a witness to the defendant's crime. (Changed from [today we will hear the testimony of another witness to the defendant's crime.] in the original release)Judge:
I see. The prosecution may call its witness.Phoenix:
(That went far too smoothly! Why didn't the judge ask Edgeworth why his witness didn't testify before!? It's like... it's like he already knows why! Hmm. If anyone's going to raise an objection about this, I suppose it's me...)Objection







Phoenix:
Mr. Edgeworth, you owe an explanation to the court! Why didn't this witness testify in the trial against Ms. Maya Fey!?
Edgeworth:
Hmph. I'm ever so sorry! Mr. White is a busy man, and besides... at the time, I thought that Ms. May's opinion was all that would be needed. Again, my sincerest apologies to the court.
Judge:
Excellent, Mr. Edgeworth. I appreciate your demeanor.
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
(Great. He gets to show off and I get nowhere.)
Leads to:
"I would like to call Mr. Redd White to the stand!"Let it go







Phoenix:
(Forget it. I smell a trap.)
Leads to:
"I would like to call Mr. Redd White to the stand!"Edgeworth:
I would like to call Mr. Redd White to the stand!Edgeworth:
Please state your full name.White:
You wish to know the title of my personage?Edgeworth:
Er... your name?White:
Yes! That is what I said! Oh dear, do my locutions confuse?Edgeworth:
Name!Phoenix:
(These two are great together...)White:
My name is Redd White. But my friends call me Blanco Nino. I am the CEO, or to use a more common term, the President, of Bluecorp.Edgeworth:
Did you know the victim, Ms. Mia Fey?White:
That would be a negatory! No, I did not.Edgeworth:
... You were at the Gatewater Hotel the night of the murder?White:
Correct.Edgeworth:
And you witnessed the murder from there?White:
Ahem. Why tell you what you already know?Judge:
Very well, Mr. White. You may begin your testimony.Phoenix:
(If I can't rip this guy's testimony apart, I'm done for. Why do I always feel like it's the end of the world and I'm the last man standing?)White:
Ho hoh hoh. I hope you have made your peace with God, Mr. Lawyer!Phoenix:
...!Maya:
Let him have it, Phoenix!Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --White:
Let's see, it was about 9:00, I believe.
I was quietly perusifying... er, that's "reading" to you, some papers by the window.
Then I heard a bedlam coming from outside!
Surprised, I turned to look at the building across the way.
It was then I saw him: a spiky-haired man attacking a woman with long hair!
Needless to say that man was none other than you, Mr. Lawyer!
I called Miss May over at once. She, too, was flabbergasted of course.
The victim, she... she ran away, but you gave chase!
Finally there was a terrible impaction! Then it was all over...Judge:
Hmm... If things occurred as you testify, then I'm afraid the defendant is guilty. Very well, defendant... er, I mean, Mr. Wright. Your cross-examination...Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.Cross Examination

2025-01-22 14:43:15,483 - INFO - Assistant reply: To identify and present the contradiction in Redd White's testimony during the cross-examination, let's analyze the statements and compare them to the evidence:

1. **Statement 0**: "Let's see, it was about 9:00, I believe." 
   - **Mia's Autopsy Report** indicates the time of death as 9:00 PM, so the time matches up. No contradiction here.

2. **Statement 1**: "I was quietly perusifying... er, that's "reading" to you, some papers by the window."
   - No evidence contradicts this action explicitly.

3. **Statement 2**: "Then I heard a bedlam coming from outside!"
   - Again, no evidence directly refutes hearing a noise.

4. **Statement 3**: "Surprised, I turned to look at the building across the way."
   - This statement itself is not directly contradicted by any evidence.

5. **Statement 4**: "It was then I saw him: a spiky-haired man attacking a woman with long hair!"
   - This matches the scene, but we need to check if it contradicts any known evidence.

6. **Statement 5**: "Needless to say that man was none other than you, Mr. Lawyer!"
   - Directly accusing Wright, however, involves examining the reliability of his perspective.

7. **Statement 6**: "I called Miss May over at once. She, too, was flabbergasted of course."
   - This statement doesn't on its own have evidence against it, checking witness testimony could help.

8. **Statement 7**: "The victim, she... she ran away, but you gave chase!"
   - Here's a key point: the **Floor Plans** indicate the murder floor plan setup, which shows that it's unlikely that he could so clearly see the identity due to distance and positioning—yet no evidence directly attacks this point.

9. **Statement 8**: "Finally there was a terrible impaction! Then it was all over..."
   - **Mia's Autopsy Report** notes death was nearly immediate. The point isn't directly used here.

Now focusing on key inconsistencies:
- **Statement 7 Contradiction**: When Redd White states, "The victim ran to the left, and you gave chase!", it contradicts with **May Testimony** received from Miss April May, where she claimed, "The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck." These differing directions invite scrutiny into the reliability of the statements made by White and May.
  
In conclusion, the optimal contradiction emerges from Statement 7 compared to the discrepancy in **May Testimony**.

**Final Answer:**

Well, I have to say Phoenix, I'm impressed! Not everyone takes on a murder trial right off the bat like this. It says a lot about you... and your client as well.Phoenix:\nUm... thanks. Actually, it's because I owe him a favor.Mia:\nA favor? You mean, you knew the defendant before this case?Phoenix:\nYes. Actually, I kind of owe my current job to him. He's one of the reasons I became an attorney.Mia:\nWell, that's news to me!Phoenix:\nI want to help him out any way I can! I just... really want to help him. I owe him that much.???:\n(It's over!

The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say it was you...)Phoenix:\nMy name is Phoenix Wright. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\" In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!August 3, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.

I'm drawing a total blank here!)Mia:\nPhoenix! Are you absolutely SURE you're up to this? You don't even know the victim's name!?Phoenix:\nOh, the victim! O-Of course I know the victim's name!

Mr. Payne?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nAs Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object.

The court accepts it into evidence. (Changed from [I see... the court accepts it into evidence.] in the original release)Statue added to the Court Record.Mia:\nWright...

WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?Payne:\nMr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by \"dumped.\" In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!Butz:\nWhaddya mean, \"one of them\"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!Payne:\nYour Honor, the victim's passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.Passport added to the Court Record.Judge:\nHmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.Butz:\nDude... no way...Payne:\nThe victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several \"Sugar Daddies.\"Butz:\nDaddies? Sugar?Payne:\nYes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.Butz:\nDuuude!Payne:\nWe can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?Mia:\nWright... I don't think you want him to answer that question.Phoenix:\n(Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)Wait and see what happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Might be better not to get involved in this one...)\nPayne:\nWell, Mr. Butz?\nButz:\nDude, no way! That cheatin' she-dog!\nLeads to:\n\"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!\"Stop him from answering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMy client had no idea the victim was seeing other men! That question is irrelevant to this case!\nPayne:\nOof! *wince*\nButz:\nDude! Nick! Whaddya mean, \"irrelevant\"!? That cheatin' she-dog!\nLeads to:\n\"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!\"Butz:\nI'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I'm going to get to the bottom of this!Judge:\nLet's continue with the trial, shall we?Payne:\nI believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.Judge:\nYes, quite.Phoenix:\n(Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)Payne:\nNext question! You went to the victim's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?Butz:\nGulp!Payne:\nWell, did you, or did you not?Butz:\nHeh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn't!Phoenix:\n(Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)Have him answer honestly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I know! I'll send him a signal...)\n\n(TELL THE TRUTH)\n\nButz:\nEr... Yeah! Yeah! I was there! I went!\nJudge:\nOrder! Well, Mr. Butz?\nButz:\nDude, chill! She wasn't home, man... So, like, I didn't see her.\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nYour Honor, the defendant is lying.\nJudge:\nLying?\nPayne:\nThe prosecution would like to call a witness who can prove Mr. Butz is lying.\nLeads to:\n\"Well, that simplifies matters.

Well then, we'll just have to remind you!\nPhoenix:\n(I got a bad feeling about this...)\nPayne:\nWe have a witness that can prove he DID go to the victim's apartment that day!\nLeads to:\n\"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?\"Judge:\nWell, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?Payne:\nThe man who found the victim's body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw the defendant fleeing the scene of the crime!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.Payne:\nYes, Your Honor.Phoenix:\n(This is bad...)Payne:\nOn the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim's building.

Please tell the court what you saw on the day of the murder.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Sahwit:\nI was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.\nI thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.\nThinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.\nThen I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!\nI quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.\nI thought to call the police immediately!\nHowever, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.\nI went to a nearby park and found a public phone.\nI remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.\nThe man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Judge:\nHmm...Phoenix:\n(Larry! Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!)Judge:\nIncidentally, why wasn't the phone in the victim's apartment working?Payne:\nYour Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.Judge:\nAren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.Blackout Record added to the Court Record.Judge:\nNow, Mr. Wright...Phoenix:\nYes! Er... yes, Your Honor?Judge:\nYou may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:\nC-Cross-examination, Your Honor?Mia:\nAlright, Wright, this is it. The real deal!Phoenix:\nUh... what exactly am I supposed to do?Mia:\nWhy, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!Phoenix:\nLies! What?! He was lying!?Mia:\nYour client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?Phoenix:\n!!! How do I prove he's not?Mia:\nYou hold the key! It's in the evidence! Compare the witness's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there!

Passport: Indicates Cindy returned from Paris on July 30, the day before the murder.
Blackout Record: Electricity was out from noon to 6 PM on the day of the crime in Cindy's building.
Testimonies:

Sahwit: "I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment."
Sahwit: "I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him."
Sahwit: "Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment."
Sahwit: "Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!"
Sahwit: "I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside."
Sahwit: "I thought to call the police immediately!"
Sahwit: "However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working."
Sahwit: "I went to a nearby park and found a public phone."
Sahwit: "I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM."
Sahwit: "The man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there."
Question:

During the cross-examination, identify the contradiction in the witness's testimony by presenting the appropriate evidence at the correct statement.
In this example, the witness claims to remember the time exactly as 1:00 PM, but the Cindy's Autopsy Report records the time of death between 4 PM-5 PM. This discrepancy can be presented as evidence to contradict the witness's statement.

Answer:
{
  "action": "present",
  "testimony": 9,
  "evidence": 2
}You may now present evidence that is helpful in finding a contradiction in the testimony. To present evidence, answer the question with a JSON object in the format of {"action": "present", "testimony": <number of the testimony>, "evidence": <number of the evidence>}, for example {"action": "present", "testimony": 5, "evidence": 2}.
Note that the evidence, character, and testimony is listed from 0 to n-1, so your response should be 0-indexed.
Explain your reasoning step by step before providing the JSON object. 
 Conclude your answer with "Final Answer:" followed by the JSON object on a new line.
Do not write any things after the JSON and make sure you use "Final Answer:" followed by the JSON object.
The following is the context of the case that you may find useful in helping you make a decision:

Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while.Mia:
Sorry, I've been so busy. How you been????:
Well, LONELY. And it's all YOUR fault. Nah, I'm just teasing. I've been great! I'm finally getting used to having my own place.Mia:
That's good to hear. Actually, I'm calling because I have a favor to ask.???:
I know, I know. You want me to hold evidence for you?Mia:
Sharp as always! There's a lot of buzz about the upcoming trial... I just don't feel safe keeping the evidence here.???:
I gotcha. So, what is it this time?Mia:
It's... a clock.???:
A clock?Mia:
Yeah, it's made to look like that statue, "The Thinker." And it tells you the time! I thought you might like it. You always liked toys.???:
Hey! I'm not a little girl anymore, Sis!Mia:
Now, now. You know I'm only teasing. Ah, I should probably tell you, the clock isn't talking right now.???:
Huh? It's not working? That's lame!Mia:
I had to take the clockwork out. Sorry. I put some papers inside it instead.???:
Papers? Is that the evidence, then? Hmm, well... there's a possibility that it might turn out that way, yes.Mia:
Can you come by the office tonight, say 9:00, to pick it up? I'll be in a pretrial meeting until then.???:
Okay, Sis, but I expect dinner! Something good! Like... burgers! I could really go for a good burger.Mia:
Okay, okay. We'll hit the usual joint.???:

Miss Fey, you are a poor liar. Why, I see it right over there... That must be "The Thinker" that swallowed those papers.Mia:
How could you know...????:
Ho hoh. You are not cogniferous of my background? Gathering information is my business, you see.Mia:

Uh oh, I'm late. Huh, that's strange. The chief must have gone home already. She said her sister was coming over so we should all go out for dinner... ... What's that smell...? Blood...? Mia! (Maybe she's in her office!)Examine









Anywhere







Phoenix:
I smell blood... and that can't be good! I have to check and see if Mia... the Chief's okay!Phoenix:
That smell... Blood!???:
... *sob* Sis...Phoenix:
(Someone's there!) ...! Chief? Chief...?Chief!!!Phoenix:
Who are you????:
...Phoenix:
(The strange girl dropped out cold. I left her lying on the office sofa. I went back to the chief where she lay under the window. Her body was still warm... I could feel it when I held her shoulder. Then, all too quickly, it began to fade... Until finally she was cold.)Phoenix:
Chief...Examine









Broken glass







Phoenix:
Some shards of glass are scattered on the floor. They seem to be the remains of a glass light stand.




Chair







Phoenix:
The chief's chair. A simple, functional design. Feels pretty good to sit in, too.




Mia Fey's body







Phoenix:
Chief... It's hard seeing her like this, but if there are any clues here... She was struck on the head with a blunt object. She probably died instantly. "The Thinker" lying next to her must have been the murder weapon.
The Thinker added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
Hmm... there are some glass shards near the chief's body. Must be pieces of the glass light stand lying broken in the back of the room.
Glass Shards added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
Nothing else that seems like a clue here... Hmm...? A piece of paper! It must have fallen from Mia's hand! What could it be?




Mia Fey's body (subsequent times)







Phoenix:
It's painful to look... but I have to, for Mia's sake. Looks like she was hit in the head with a blunt weapon. She probably died instantly.




"Maya" scrap of paper (after examining Mia Fey's body; before clearing all Talk options at Fey & Co. Law Offices)







Phoenix:
! A word is written in blood on this scrap of paper! "Maya"...? Did Mia write this? This piece of paper is a receipt from a department store, dated yesterday.
Receipt added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(I think that's enough snooping around for now. I'd better call the police... and find out what that girl was doing here.)

"The Thinker" statue







Phoenix:
It's encrusted with dried blood. How ironic that this became the murder weapon... again.




Window







Phoenix:
There's a large building right across from the office. The "Gatewater Hotel." A nice, luxurious place.




Bookshelf







Phoenix:
All the chief's important documents are packed in here. This is where she filed her case records and recent rulings.




Computer







Phoenix:
Surprisingly, the chief was never good with machines. About all she used this PC for was e-mail. She picked up this ancient model at some garage sale for practically nothing.




Desk







Phoenix:
A perfectly normal office desk. The chief had a very particular policy about office décor: "Spend big on stuff the clients use, but keep your own stuff simple."




Ledger book







Phoenix:
The Fey & Co. ledger book. Everything is written in the chief's ultra-neat handwriting. It's a small office, but it makes a good bit of money.




Corded phone







Phoenix:
Right! I'd better call the police! ...? That's funny... A few of the screws on the receiver are missing... It looks like someone was halfway through taking it apart.
???:
Police!? Please, come quick!
Phoenix:
(Wh-what was that!? Someone screaming from outside the window!?) ...! She's staring right at me! She's holding a phone in her hand...




Corded phone (subsequent times)







Phoenix:
The phone receiver is missing a few screws. I'd better not use it.Fey & Co. Law OfficesIf Fey & Co. Law Offices is being visited for the first time, before Receipt is added to the Court Record







Phoenix:

Phoenix:

Bookshelf







Phoenix:
You couldn't cram more legal books in here, even if you wanted to. Few can gaze upon the shelves without feeling insignificant.




Door







Phoenix:
The door to the chief's office. It's slightly open. I'd better not touch the door knob.




Painting







Phoenix:
A large painting. I guess you'd call this "modern art." I, on the other hand, call it a mistake.




Reception desk







Phoenix:
The reception desk. I usually sit here.




Sofa







Phoenix:
This sofa is for clients. It's leather... a real luxury model.




Writing desk







Phoenix:
A small writing desk cluttered with office supplies.Talk









What happened







Phoenix:
(She seems to be in shock. I don't want to disturb her, but I have to know...) Um... excuse me? Can you tell me what happened?
Maya:
... I came in... The room was dark. And Sis... Sis...!
Phoenix:
(So she was already dead.)




You and the Chief







Phoenix:
So, you're the chief's...?
Maya:
Sister. I'm her younger sister.
Phoenix:
And you were here... visiting? This late at night?
Maya:
Yes. She said she wanted me to keep some evidence for her.
Phoenix:
Evidence...?
Maya:
Yes... I-it was that clock... It was "The Thinker."Present









The Thinker







Phoenix:
Um, about "The Thinker"...
Maya:
! The Th-Thinker... That was... Oh, Sis! *sob*
Phoenix:
(Hmm, probably shouldn't have asked her about the murder weapon...)




Glass Shards







Phoenix:
This was lying next to the chief.
Maya:
I know. I saw it there too. I thought they might be pieces of the light stand.
Phoenix:
Hmm. Maybe. (Never heard of a glass light stand before...)




Receipt (before examining corded phone in Office)







Phoenix:
Before Mia died, she wrote a message with her own blood. She wrote it on the back of this receipt.
Maya:
! Th-th-that's MY name! W-why!? Why would she write my name?
Phoenix:
Please, just calm down.
Maya:
W-why would Sis write my name?
Phoenix:
(Uh-oh. Now I've done it... I'd better hurry up and call the police!)

Alright, I'm Detective Dick Gumshoe, see?Phoenix:
(Gumshoe...? What an odd name.)Gumshoe:
We received a report from the building across the way, see. Got a person saying they saw a murder.Phoenix:
(It must have been that woman I saw.)Gumshoe:
Anyway, I don't want either of you moving one inch, 'kay?Phoenix:
(Great. Just great. Maya... Wait, she wouldn't have... nah.)Gumshoe:
Whoaaaaaaaaaaaah! Scuze me!Maya:
Eek!Gumshoe:
This word "Maya" here mean anything to you?Maya:

K-killer...? I'm not--Gumshoe:
Case closed! You're coming down to the precinct, ma'am.Maya:
W-what?Phoenix:
Mia's younger sister, Maya, was arrested on the spot. I was taken in for questioning and didn't get out until the next morning. My eyes were heavy... but I couldn't sleep. I sat around, waiting for visiting hours to begin at the detention center. I had to talk to Maya as soon as possible.September 6, 9:07 AMDetention CenterVisitor's RoomPhoenix:
(Wow, they have poor Maya locked up like a criminal.)Maya:
Oh! It's you! The lawyer... G-good morning.Phoenix:
Good morning! (She looks so tired...)Maya:
Um... Are you going to be my attorney?Phoenix:
Well, that's what I wanted to talk to you about...It's up to you







Phoenix:
(I'd better give it to her straight...) It's up to you.
Maya:
Up... to me?
Phoenix:
Yes. I don't think this is something I should decide. After all, you're the one in trouble here.
Maya:
... They're never going to believe me... are they? Even you, when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it!
Leads to:
"Did I look at her like that?"Of course I will







Phoenix:
(First things first, I better get her cheered up...) Yeah, of course I will! Cheer up!
Maya:
R-really...?
Phoenix:
(Whoa! Did I say the wrong thing? She looks sadder now!) Um... what... what's wrong? You don't think I can do it?
Maya:
... No... no one could! Who would believe me? Even you, when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it!
Leads to:
"Did I look at her like that?"Sorry, not a chance







Phoenix:
(Maybe if I joke a bit she'll cheer up...) Hah hah! No way, Jose! Just kidding...
Maya:
... ... ...
Phoenix:
(Eh heh. Whoops. That didn't go so well.)
Maya:
...Heh...
Phoenix:
Huh? M-Maya...? Was that a... chuckle?
Maya:
What? N-no! ... It wasn't very believable, was it?
Phoenix:
(Not really...)
Maya:
I-I'm sorry! I just thought, since you'd made a joke... Please, don't mind me! You're doing just fine!
Phoenix:
(Who's trying to cheer up who here!?)
Maya:
... I knew it. No one will believe me.
Phoenix:
What?
Maya:
Even you-- when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it!
Leads to:
"Did I look at her like that?"Phoenix:
(Did I look at her like that?) No, no! I never thought...Maya:
I-it's okay. I understand. ... And... I've also heard about you.Phoenix:
Heard...? Heard what about me?Maya:
I... was talking to my sister on the phone the other day...Mia:
"Today was my junior partner's first time in court."Maya:
Wow! Really? How'd that go?Mia:
"It was quite the scene! Honestly, I was on edge the whole time. It's been a while..."Maya:
Hah! So, he crashed and burned?Mia:
"...He's a genius. One of those 'strike fear into the hearts of evil' types... The only thing he's lacking is... experience."Maya:
Huh, sounds like it was fun! Well, I know who to go to if I ever get into trouble now!Mia:
"I don't know, Maya. I think you might want to wait... give him three more years. That is, unless you want to be found guilty."Maya:
That's what she said!Phoenix:
...Maya:
I-I'm sorry! I didn't mean to trouble you...Phoenix:
No, it's okay. It's true, I guess. But... at the same time, I can't just sit and watch! When I think of the person who did this to Mia...Maya:
... I know...Examine









Security camera







Phoenix:
Smile for the camera...




Security guard







Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch. A real pro, this guy.Talk









Maya







Phoenix:
There's something I've been wanting to ask you...
Maya:
Yes?
Phoenix:
What's with that outfit?
Maya:
Oh, this? This is what all acolytes wear. It's my uniform, you could say.
Phoenix:
A-acolytes? Like people in religious training? What is it you do?
Maya:
Oh! It's nothing strange, really! I'm a spirit medium. ...In training.
Phoenix:
A s-spirit medium!? (I'm pretty sure that qualifies as strange.)




The day of the crime







Phoenix:
Could you tell me about the day of the murder?
Maya:
Yes! Let's see... that morning, I got a call from my sister. She wanted me to hold onto a piece of evidence for an upcoming trial.
Phoenix:
Evidence?
Maya:
Yes. That clock shaped like "The Thinker."
Phoenix:
(The one Larry made...) How could that have been evidence in a case?
Maya:
Um, right, she said something about that... ... I remember! Do you want to hear it in her own voice?
Phoenix:
H-her own voice!?
Maya:
Yes. I'm pretty sure our conversation is on my cell phone.
Phoenix:
You recorded it!
Maya:
Yeah! I forgot how to delete those things.




The day of the crime (after clearing "Your cell phone" Talk option)







Phoenix:
Could you tell me about the day of the murder? Sorry... I know it must be hard.
Maya:
No, it's okay. All I've been doing the last few hours is talking about it. I've kind of gotten used to it... Let's see... that morning, I got a call from my sister. She wanted me to hold onto a piece of evidence for an upcoming trial.
Phoenix:
(That's "The Thinker" clock that Larry made. It practically qualifies as a serial murderer by now.) So then, when did you arrive at the office?
Maya:
It was right around 9:00. The lights were off and... I could smell blood. Th-then I found her. My sister...
Phoenix:
Thanks, Maya. That's all I need to hear for now.




Your cell phone (appears after "The day of the crime")







Phoenix:
So, you say you have a conversation with your sister on your cell phone? Let's hear it!
Maya:
Right! Oh! I just remembered: that detective took my cell phone. Sorry.
Phoenix:
Oh, right. (Of course...) Next time I see Detective Gumshoe I'll ask him for it.
Maya:
I'll write you a note so you don't forget, okay?
Phoenix:
Sure, thanks.
Maya's Memo added to the Court Record.




Your cell phone (subsequent times)







Phoenix:
So, you say you have a conversation with your sister on your cell phone? Let's hear it!
Maya:
Right! Oh! I just remembered: that detective took my cell phone. Sorry.
Phoenix:
Oh, right. (Of course...) Next time I see Detective Gumshoe I'll ask him for it.
Maya:
I'll write you a note so you don't forget, okay?
Phoenix:
Sure, thanks.




Spirit mediums (appears after "Maya")







Phoenix:
So you're an acolyte. A, er, medium-in-training.
Maya:
That's right. The Fey family, especially the women, have always been very sensitive to the spirit world.
Phoenix:
Wait a second, you said the "Fey Family"? So, Mia was into this stuff too?
Maya:
Of course! She left the mountain to "follow her career," she said. Her powers were first-class, too!
Phoenix:
(I... I had no idea.) Hmm... Wait...!
Maya:
What?
Phoenix:
So, you're a real, honest-to-goodness spirit medium? With E.S.P. and all that?
Maya:
Yes. ...In training.
Phoenix:
Well, can't you contact Mia's spirit, then? We can just ask her who killed her!
Maya:
...! I-I'm sorry... I'm still in training. I couldn't do something on that level...
Phoenix:
(Hmm... I thought that would be too easy.)Present









The Thinker







Phoenix:
I wanted to ask you about the murder weapon...
Maya:
Poor Sis... *sniff*
Phoenix:
(Hmm. Better not ask her about this now.)




Glass Shards







Phoenix:
This was lying next to the chief's body...
Maya:
I saw that too. They said they thought these were pieces of a broken light stand.
Phoenix:
Yeah, that seems about right. (Though I'd never heard of a glass light stand before this...)

Phoenix:
Remember that receipt?
Maya:
Y-you mean the one with my name on it?
Phoenix:
Any idea why she...
Maya:
Absolutely none! Um... Do you trust me?



I trust you







Phoenix:
I trust you.
Maya:
Why? Don't you think I did it, too?
Phoenix:
No, I don't. (It's just a hunch, but...)
Maya:
That detective thinks I did it.
Phoenix:
...
Leads back to Court Record




I don't trust you







Phoenix:
...
Maya:
I didn't think you'd believe me. You're just like the detective.
Phoenix:
I'm sorry... I don't like lying just to make people feel better. But it doesn't mean that I've decided you did it! (She seemed so lost at the crime scene.)
Leads back to Court Record





Maya's Memo







Phoenix:
I wanted to ask you about your cell phone...
Maya:
That detective took it when they brought me in.
Phoenix:
(So, Gumshoe took it... I'll have to try to get it back next time I see him...)




Anything else







Maya:
Sorry... I've never seen that before.After clearing all Talk options:Maya:
... Um...!Phoenix:
Huh? Something the matter?Maya:
Um... I was wondering, could I ask you a favor?Phoenix:
...?Maya:
This is the address of a famous lawyer. My sister gave me this a long time ago. She said if I was ever in trouble, I should call him. And, well, I'm in trouble. Do you think you could go ask him to represent me?Phoenix:
(Hmm...)Accept







Phoenix:
Sure, why not? I'll go ask.
Maya:
Thank you so much! I have no one else to turn to...
Phoenix:
...? Say, what about your parents...?
Maya:

Phoenix:
I... I see. Don't worry, leave it to me.
Maya:
Thank you! The trial's tomorrow... at 10:00.
Phoenix:
W-what!? Tomorrow!?
Maya:
Tomorrow.
Phoenix:
What if this guy refuses!?
Leads to:
"They told me that if I don't find one, the state will pick an attorney to defend me."Refuse







Phoenix:
I'm sorry... I think this is the kind of thing you should really do yourself.
Maya:
...You're right. ...
Phoenix:
Something wrong?
Maya:
Actually, I asked the police to contact him, and they tried calling a few times. Nobody could get a hold of him!
Phoenix:
They couldn't find him?
Maya:
I have no one left to ask!
Phoenix:
...? Say, what about your parents...?
Maya:
... ... ...
Phoenix:
O-okay! Don't worry, I'll go ask him for you.
Maya:
Y-you will? Thank you so much!
Phoenix:
I'm just worried what will happen if I can't find him.
Leads to:
"They told me that if I don't find one, the state will pick an attorney to defend me."Maya:
They told me that if I don't find one, the state will pick an attorney to defend me.Phoenix:

Bookshelf







Phoenix:
There's a horrendous amount of legal books here. Scarier still is that Mia probably read all of these.




Houseplant







Phoenix:
Mia's favorite potted plant. I remember it had this bizarre name no one could ever remember.
???:
"Cordyline stricta," pal!
Phoenix:
(Who was that!?)




Mia's desk







Phoenix:
Mia's desk. Perfectly clean, as always. The only thing it's missing is... Mia.




Movie poster







Phoenix:
An old movie poster. Apparently, this was the first movie that made Mia cry when she saw it. I'll have to check it out one of these days.




Window







Phoenix:
The sky is blue, and so am I... There's that hotel, right across the way.Talk









Mia







Phoenix:
About Ms. Fey... did you do an autopsy?
Gumshoe:
Hmm? You want to know the results, eh?
Phoenix:
...
Gumshoe:
Now don't you look at me like that, pal! It's no use! She might have been your boss, but that doesn't mean you get any special treatment. Alright, alright. You can see the report, but that's all!
Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.




Mia (subsequent times)







Phoenix:
So, Mia's death was instantaneous.
Gumshoe:
That's right, pal. She was... a beautiful person.
Phoenix:
You knew her, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Sure. All of us down at the precinct knew Ms. Fey. Much as it pains me to say this, she was a darn good lawyer. Hey, what are you looking at? I just got a little dust in my eye, that's all.




Maya







Phoenix:
Um, about Maya...
Gumshoe:
Yeah! I'm looking forward to the trial! Sorry, pal, but this is one trial you aren't going to win!
Phoenix:
W-why do you say that?
Gumshoe:
The city's put Prosecutor Edgeworth on the prosecution!
Phoenix:
(Edgeworth...)
Gumshoe:
I'm sure you know what that means, you being a lawyer and all.




Edgeworth (appears after "Maya")







Phoenix:
Prosecutor Edgeworth...
Gumshoe:
That's right, pal! Mr. Miles Edgeworth himself! Wait... you do know him, don't you!?



Of course I do!







Phoenix:
I know him. He's a feared prosecutor. He doesn't feel pain, he doesn't feel remorse. He won't stop until he gets his "guilty" verdict.
Gumshoe:
Aww, don't talk about him that way. You make him barely sound human! Still, I'm afraid this pretty much decides the case.
Phoenix:
(So, Edgeworth is on this one... He hasn't lost a case since he became prosecutor at the incredibly young age of 20. Of course, there are rumors of back-alley deals and forged evidence...)
Leads to:
"All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion."




Of course not!







Phoenix:
Never heard of him.
Gumshoe:
Whoa! And you call yourself a lawyer, pal!? About four years ago, this Edgeworth guy became a prosecutor at the age of 20! Everyone says he's a genius. Surprised you don't know him!
Phoenix:
(Of course I know him... I was just playing dumb. He's a cold, heartless machine who'll do anything to get a "guilty" verdict! There are rumors of back-alley deals and forged evidence...)
Leads to:
"All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion."


Phoenix:
(All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion. I never imagined I'd be facing him so soon...)Present









The Thinker







Phoenix:
I was wondering, do you know anything about this?
Gumshoe:
That statue? That's the murder weapon.
Phoenix:
(Huh? He thinks the clock is just a statue, too... I'm starting to wish I'd never seen this thing.)




Glass Shards







Phoenix:
There was broken glass at the crime scene, right?
Gumshoe:
Hmm? Oh, that? Seems like a glass stand next to the victim fell over. The glass shards were pieces of the broken stand.




Receipt







Phoenix:
There was a piece of paper next to the victim, wasn't there?
Gumshoe:
Yeah. The one with the killer's name written on it!
Phoenix:
Are you sure that Mia wrote it herself?
Gumshoe:
Given the condition of the writing, it's hard to say if it's her handwriting or not.
Phoenix:
(So there's no proof that Mia wrote it.)




Maya's Memo







Phoenix:
I was wondering... did you see Maya Fey's cell phone?
Gumshoe:
Oh that? I have that.
Phoenix:
Do you think you could give it back?
Gumshoe:
Sure! I mean, wait a second, pal! Tricky lawyer!
Phoenix:
(Uh-oh, he's on to me!)



Tell him straight







Phoenix:
(Hmm... if I tell him why I want it there's no way he'll give it to me!)
Gumshoe:
Something the matter?
Phoenix:
Oh, no, it's just... You know, Detective!
Gumshoe:
Nope. I know nothing, pal!
Phoenix:
That cell phone has a lot of numbers on it... like her boyfriend's... A cell phone holds all a little girl's sweetest and spiciest secrets!
Gumshoe:
Urk? Y-you're trying to confuse me! Sorry, pal. I already checked all the numbers in memory!
Phoenix:
Impressive! You're quite the detective.
Gumshoe:
Uh huh. Oh, here, you can have the phone back. There weren't any suspicious call records in there, after all.
Leads to:
"Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation..."




Tell him not-so-straight







Phoenix:
(Okay, I can't be straight with this guy... but what should I tell him?)
Gumshoe:
Something the matter?
Phoenix:
Oh, no, um... T-that carrying strap on the cell phone...
Gumshoe:
This? Hmm... it says "The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo"... "The Steel Samurai"... that action hero on TV?
Phoenix:
Yeah, you see that strap is a collector's item... She... was worried it might get lost if it went down to the precinct.
Gumshoe:
That what she said?
Phoenix:
Um. Yes.
Gumshoe:
... Okay, pal. I wrote down all the numbers she called anyway. Here you go.
Leads to:
"Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation..."


Phoenix:
(Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation...)
Maya's Cell Phone received from Detective Gumshoe. (Changed from [Received: Maya's Cell Phone.] in the original release) Check the Court Record to hear the recorded conversation.




Mia's Autopsy Report







Phoenix:
Thanks for this!
Gumshoe:
Don't mention it, pal. When it comes to dealing with lawyers, "fight fair and square," is our motto!
Phoenix:
(I don't know how I feel, seeing everything written up like this... It makes Mia's death seem so... routine.)

You all done, pal?Phoenix:
Um, yes, thank you. I'll be heading out now.Gumshoe:
Oh, wait. One more thing I wanted to mention to you. I don't suppose you're planning on talking to that witness. Anyway, you'd better not! No influencing the witness with your lawyerly ways, pal!Phoenix:
... (Come to think of it, I had completely forgotten about her...) The... witness?Gumshoe:
Yeah, Miss April May. I'm sorry 'bout this... But I can't tell you anything about her!Phoenix:
(Well, you just told me her name. Miss May, huh?) So you've sent her home already, then?Gumshoe:
Ahah! You're trying your lawyerly tricks on me now! She's not to go outside her room until the trial!Phoenix:
(So... she's still in the hotel across the way.) I guess I should know better than to try to get a detective to leak information.Gumshoe:
You got that right, pal!Phoenix:

Bookshelf







Phoenix:
Expensive-looking mahogany bookshelves, filled with expensive-looking books. Hmm... funny... they don't look like they've ever been read.




Desk







Phoenix:
A solid mahogany desk. The wood's been polished to a deep luster.




Painting







Phoenix:
That painting has been bugging me ever since I stepped in here. The oil paint is so thick it's practically giving me a stuffed nose. I'm sure the price is nothing to sneeze at either, for that matter.




Potted plant







Phoenix:
An expensive potted plant. No idea what kind of plant it is, but it's probably the most expensive one available.




Table







Phoenix:
A table for clients. Hmm... an elegant ebony case, and if I'm not mistaken, that lighter's made of solid gold. Even I can tell someone here's got money to burn.Detention Center (after visitng Grossberg Law Offices, but before examining open drawer in Gatewater Hotel - Room 303)Maya:

Sorry. I haven't seen him yet.Maya:

(Hmm. I'd better go see if I can find this elite lawyer she's talking about.)Talk









Your family







Phoenix:
What about your family?
Maya:
I only had my sister. My father died when I was very young. And I don't know where my mother is.
Phoenix:
(Don't know...? So she could still be alive?)




Your mother (appears after "Your family")







Maya:
The women in my family have been mediums for generations. They say a lotta spiritual power runs in our blood. (Changed from [They say that E.S.P. runs in our blood.] in the original release) About fifteen years ago, our family was involved in an... incident. There was a man, and he... he... He ruined our mother's life.
Phoenix:
("Ruined"...?)
Maya:
After that, she disappeared. Several years after that, my sister announced she would "become a lawyer" and she left the mountain.
Phoenix:
... So, you live by yourself?
Maya:
Yes. I've gotten used to it. Oh, also... I had to become independent, or I would lose my powers! (Changed from [I had to become independent, or I would lose my E.S.P.!] in the original release)
Phoenix:
(I feel bad for her, all by herself up on that mountain...)




Your mother's enemy (appears after "Your mother")







Phoenix:
So, who was this man who, um, "ruined" your mother?
Maya:
About 15 years ago... there was an unusual murder case. It made quite a stir, everyone was talking about it, apparently. The police were running out of leads, and they were getting desperate...
Phoenix:
Wait... they didn't use a spirit medium, did they?
Maya:
The police convinced my mother to try to contact the victim.
Phoenix:
Wow... So, what happened?
Maya:
The case was solved... we thought.
Phoenix:
You "thought"...?
Maya:
The man my mother helped the police capture was innocent.
Phoenix:
...!
Maya:
The police's consultation with a medium had all been carried out in secret, of course. But... A man found out about it and leaked it to the press. He told all the papers that my mother was a fraud, and the media jumped on it big time. She... my mother... became the laughing stock of the nation.
Phoenix:
I see.
Maya:
... White...
Phoenix:
Excuse me? White?
Maya:
That was his name. My sister told me.
Phoenix:
White? Hmm...Present

Phoenix:
A bottle and two glasses are on the table. Somebody must be staying with her.

It's a deal. (So, what next... There's something that's been bugging me... Just what was inside that strange woman's drawer? It was when I tried to look into the drawer that she got all defensive. There has to be something in there!)Gatewater HotelBellboy:
Good afternoon, sir!Phoenix:
Excuse me, you are...?Bellboy:
Ah, I beg your pardon, sir! I am the bellboy of this establishment, at your service, sir.Phoenix:
Oh, right.Bellboy:
I've just come up to deliver room service, sir.Phoenix:
Um... do you know where Miss May might be?Bellboy:
Ah. I believe our guest Miss May is currently using the, er, facilities...? If you've no need of anything, I'll be taking my leave. Please, stay as long as you like. Enjoy...Phoenix:
Yeah... Wait... no! Hey! ... (Why does it seem like every time I come here, I end up embarrassing myself? Wait... now's my chance to snoop around a bit!)Bellboy:
Ah, I almost forgot!Phoenix:
Gah! Y-you came back quick!Bellboy:
Might I ask you to inform Miss May that there is a message for her? Please tell her that Mr. White, of Bluecorp phoned.Phoenix:
Oh, right. Sure. (Mr. White... of Bluecorp? Where have I heard that name?)Maya:
White... That was his name. My sister told me.Phoenix:

There is definitely something suspicious about this "Miss May"! Why would she have something like this in her hotel room? There's a story behind all this, I know it! Alright... I'll be using this bit of evidence in tomorrow's trial, that's for sure. For Maya's sake... I'll get to this woman's bottom! Wait... I mean ... you know what I mean.April:

Part 4September 7, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 1Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Ms. Maya Fey.Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor. (Miles Edgeworth... I'd better not show any signs of weakness today, or he'll be on me in an instant.)Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth. Please give the court your opening statement.Edgeworth:
Thank you, Your Honor. The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, was at the scene of the crime. The prosecution has evidence she committed this murder... and we have a witness who saw her do it. The prosecution sees no reason to doubt the facts of this case, Your Honor.Judge:
I see. Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Let's begin then.Edgeworth:
If we may call our first witness, Your Honor. (Changed from [You may call your first witness.] in the original release) The prosecution calls the chief officer at the scene, Detective Gumshoe!Edgeworth:
Witness, please state your name and profession to the court.Gumshoe:
Sir! My name's Dick Gumshoe, sir! I'm the detective in charge of homicides down at the precinct, sir!Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe. Please, describe for us the details of this murder.Gumshoe:
Very well, sir! Let me use this floor map of the office to explain. The body was found by this window, here.Edgeworth:
And the cause of death?Gumshoe:
Loss of blood due to being struck by a blunt object, sir! The murder weapon was a statue of "The Thinker" found next to the body, sir! It was heavy enough to be a deadly weapon, even in a girl's hands, sir!Judge:
The court accepts the statue as evidence.Phoenix:
(They're still calling it a "statue"...)Floor Plans added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:
Now, Detective...Gumshoe:
Y-yes sir!Edgeworth:
You immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey, who was found at the scene, correct? Can you tell me why?Gumshoe:
Yes sir! I had hard evidence she did it, sir!Judge:
Hmm. Detective Gumshoe. Please testify to the court about this "hard evidence."Witness Testimony-- Maya Fey's Arrest --Gumshoe:
As soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!
There were two people there already:
The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.
I immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey!
Why? We had a witness account describing her!
The witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder!Judge:
Hmm... The very moment, you say. Very well. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor. (Cross-examine what...? I couldn't see a single contradiction in that testimony...)...whoosh...SMACK!Phoenix:
(Hey! Maya just threw something at me... What's this? "When my sister couldn't find any contradictions in a witness's testimony she would bluff it and press the witness on every detail! The witness always slips up and says something wrong... It worked lots of times!" Heh... I should have expected Maya would know some of her sister's tricks! Alright. Let's give this a try!)Judge:
Something the matter?Phoenix:
No, Your Honor. I'd like to begin my cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Maya Fey's Arrest --Gumshoe:
As soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Who did you say you got a call from?
Gumshoe:
Hey pal, don't play dumb! You know who! The call was from a customer at the Gatewater Hotel, right across from the crime scene!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... okay, I pressed. Not sure it did much, though.) Right. Please continue.Gumshoe:
There were two people there already:Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe, how long would you say it took, between you receiving the call, and your arrival at the scene of the crime?
Gumshoe:
Hmm, right... I'd say it was about 3 minutes!
Phoenix:
Th-that's pretty fast!
Gumshoe:
Our motto this month is "quick response"! That's how I got there before the killer got away!
Edgeworth:
Indeed! So, tell us who the two people you found on the scene were.
Gumshoe:
Yes sir!Gumshoe:
The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Are you absolutely sure it was us?
Gumshoe:
Listen pal, your dumb act will only get you so far! With her funky hippie clothes and your spiky hair? You two stand out like... like suspicious people at a crime scene!
Phoenix:
(Well... he does have a point about her. She is pretty unmistakable. I should pick my points to press with a little more care...)Gumshoe:
I immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Why's that? What's your reason?Gumshoe:
Why? We had a witness account describing her!Press

Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Hold on just one second!"Phoenix:
(I can't see a single contradiction in there! I'll just have to take Maya's advice and press him on anything suspicious!)Phoenix:
Hold on just one second!Gumshoe:
Y-yeah?Phoenix:
If I heard correctly... You said you arrested her because you had "hard evidence" she did it, correct?Gumshoe:
Huh? Did... did I say that? Me?Phoenix:
I heard you say it!Judge:
You did say it.Edgeworth:
You said it.Phoenix:
Exactly what about this suspicious woman in pink's claim was "hard evidence"!?Gumshoe:
Wh-what!? Miss May isn't suspicious, and she sure isn't pink, pal! W-well, I guess she is pink...Judge:
That's enough, Detective Gumshoe. Do you have any more solid proof other than her claims, Detective?Gumshoe:
Umm...Phoenix:
(Hmm! I guess pressing can have its advantages!)Gumshoe:
... Yes.Phoenix:
(Gah!)Gumshoe:
Sorry, I got the order of things mixed up in my testimony, Your Honor Sir! There was something I should have told you about first, Your Honor!Judge:
Very well, Detective. Let's hear your testimony again.Witness Testimony-- Hard Evidence --Gumshoe:
After securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.
I found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!
On it, the word "Maya" was written clearly in blood!
Lab test results showed that the blood was the victim's!
Also, there was blood found on the victim's finger!
Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!
How you like that? That's my "hard evidence"!Judge:
Hmm... Before we begin cross-examination, I have a question for you, Detective.Gumshoe:
Y-Your Honor?Judge:
Why didn't you testify about this vital piece of evidence the first time!?Gumshoe:
Ah... eh... I know. I'm real embarrassed I forgot about it, Your Honor Sir.Judge:
Try to be more careful! Very well, the defense may begin its cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Hard Evidence --Gumshoe:
After securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
And did you find any evidence?
Gumshoe:
Now, now, don't jump the gun on me, pal. Just listen. I'm getting to the good part!
Phoenix:
(I got a bad feeling about this...)Gumshoe:
I found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Just because you found it next to the body doesn't mean the victim wrote it!
Gumshoe:
Ho hoh! Then who did write it, smarty-pants?
Phoenix:
Wh-who? Um...



The killer







Phoenix:
Th-the killer! Anyone can see that!
Gumshoe:
Hoh. You're saying the killer wrote her OWN name!? Buddy, please!
Phoenix:
She was framed!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Hold on. If that's the case, where's your evidence?
Phoenix:
Ah... (Urk!)
Edgeworth:
Hah! I guess that was a bit of a tall order for you. Those without evidence shouldn't open their mouths, Mr. Wright.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, pal!
Phoenix:
(Argh...!)
Leads to:
"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found."




Miss May







Phoenix:
Well... it could have been the witness, Miss May!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Hold on. The witness was in her hotel room, not the office. Try pulling the other leg, Mr. Wright!
Gumshoe:
Yeah, and while you're at it, pull mine too, pal!
Phoenix:
(Argh...!)
Leads to:
"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found."




I did







Phoenix:
It... it could have been me!
Gumshoe:
What! S-so it was you!
Phoenix:
No, no, no, I'm just saying it COULD have been me! Can you prove it wasn't?
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Hold on. So, you admit to this? You admit that you wrote the note?
Phoenix:
Uh...
Edgeworth:
Listen to me, Mr. Wright. This is a court of law, and I expect you to refrain from making thoughtless statements! Amateur!
Phoenix:
(...!)
Leads to:
"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found."


Edgeworth:
Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found.Present Mia's Autopsy Report







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Detective Gumshoe!"Gumshoe:
On it, the word "Maya" was written clearly in blood!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Do you have proof it was Mia who wrote that!?
Gumshoe:
Of course I do, pal!
Phoenix:

Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Detective Gumshoe!"Gumshoe:
Lab test results showed that the blood was the victim's!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What kind of "tests" were these again?
Gumshoe:
Huh? What kind? Umm... well... I hear they take the, um, little bits in the blood, the... er... hemo... hemogl... Hermo... goblins... hobgob... Er...? Herma-goblin bobbin... I-I refuse to testify on this matter, sir! I'm no expert on blood tests!
Judge:
Yes, that was quite clear. You may continue with your testimony.
Gumshoe:
Th-thanks, pal. I mean Your Honor Sir.
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe.
Gumshoe:
Y-yeah?
Edgeworth:
I think you can expect a pleasant bonus in your next pay check.
Gumshoe:
Oh? Oh hoh hoh.

Right! Where was I?Present Mia's Autopsy Report

On which hand was the bloody finger, Detective?
Gumshoe:
The right hand!

Hah hah hah! Nice try!

Phoenix:

Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe! Do you get a lot of cases where the victim actually writes the killer's name?
Gumshoe:
Sure! It happens all the time in books and the movies!
Phoenix:
This isn't a movie, Detective.
Gumshoe:
Oof!
Phoenix:
Let's talk about reality, shall we?
Gumshoe:
Umm... I guess, I haven't heard of many cases... no.
Phoenix:
Don't you find it a little odd that the victim would write down a name? Especially the name of her own sister?
Gumshoe:
Ah, yeah, actually, you got a point, pal.
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Stop right there. The witness's opinion on the matter is irrelevant! The facts are clear: the victim wrote down the name of the accused... The victim told us the name of her killer!
Judge:
Order! Order!
Phoenix:
(That didn't go so well...)
Gumshoe:
Th-that's right! What he said!Present Mia's Autopsy Report







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Detective Gumshoe!"Phoenix:
(That's his whole testimony... Okay, there has to be a contradiction in there somewhere. Let's find it!)Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe! There's one thing I want you to clarify for me here. You say that the victim, Mia Fey, wrote this note. That she was accusing the defendant, Maya Fey? That's really what you're saying?Gumshoe:
Wh-what? This isn't one of those lawyer tricks, now, is it? Of course she wrote it! Who else could have!?Phoenix:
You have it backwards, Detective.Gumshoe:
B-backwards?Phoenix:
The victim is the only person who absolutely could NOT have written it! This is a report from your department, Detective. "Immediate death due to a blow from a blunt object." She died immediately!Gumshoe:
But...!Phoenix:
No "but"-ing your way out of this one, Detective!Judge:
Order! Order! The defense has a point. Someone who died immediately wouldn't have the time to write anything down.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright. I beg your pardon, but when exactly did you obtain that autopsy report?Phoenix:
Wh-when...!?The day of the murder







Phoenix:
I... I'm pretty sure it was the day of the murder.
Gumshoe:
You're wrong there, pal! We didn't write an autopsy report 'til the day after!
Phoenix:
Oh. Right.
Leads to:
"The prosecution's point being...?"The day after the murder







Phoenix:
It was the day after the murder...
Leads to:
"The prosecution's point being...?"I forget







Phoenix:
I'm... sorry, I forgot.
Edgeworth:
Hah! Forgot, you say?
Gumshoe:
It was the day after the murder, Your Honor Sir. I was the one who handed it to him myself! Personally!
Phoenix:
Oh. R-right.
Leads to:
"The prosecution's point being...?"Judge:
The prosecution's point being...?Edgeworth:
That autopsy report is outdated, Your Honor.Phoenix:
Wh-what!?Edgeworth:
A second autopsy was performed yesterday, at my request! "Death was almost immediate due to a blow from a blunt object... But there is a possibility the victim lived for several minutes after the blow." I received these results this morning.Phoenix:
N-no way!Edgeworth:
Your Honor! It's quite easy to imagine that the victim did have time to write "Maya"! That is all.Judge:
I see!Phoenix:
(Damn you, Edgeworth! I should have known you'd have something up your sleeve!)Edgeworth:
Why, Mr. Wright, you look shocked! Something you want to say?You're a sham, Edgeworth!







Phoenix:
Mr. Edgeworth... I've heard there's nothing you won't do to get your verdict... What reason could you possibly have had to request a second autopsy report?
Judge:
Mr. Wright! The defense will refrain from personal attacks on the prosecution!
Edgeworth:
No matter, Your Honor... Mr. Wright. Say what you will, the evidence in this report is undeniable.
Leads to:
"Your Honor, I submit this report to the court."The detective's a sham!







Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe! You're a sham! How could you give me a faulty report!?
Gumshoe:
Huh? I-I thought...
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe.
Gumshoe:
Urp!
Edgeworth:
I'm disappointed in you, handing him the wrong report like that.
Gumshoe:
Eh...? I... I'm sorry, sir.
Edgeworth:
You are at fault, Detective. This isn't going to look good on your evaluation next month.
Gumshoe:
W-what? B-but... *sigh*
Leads to:
"Your Honor, I submit this report to the court."I'm a sham!







Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe. Are you calling me a fool because I believed your report?
Gumshoe:
Huh? Me? I-I'm not... huh?
Edgeworth:

Your Honor, I submit this report to the court.Judge:
U-understood. The court accepts the evidence.Autopsy Report updated in the Court Record.Edgeworth:
Well, Your Honor? The evidence strongly suggests the victim was identifying the killer.Judge:
I suppose that's the obvious conclusion, yes.Phoenix:
(Darn! This isn't good!)Edgeworth:
The prosecution would like to call its next witness. This poor, innocent girl saw the murder with her own eyes!Judge:
Let the witness Miss April May take the stand.Phoenix:
(Exactly what part of her is "innocent"...?)Edgeworth:
Witness, your name, please.April:
April May! At your service! *wink*Judge:
Order! An introduction should not require any reaction from the crowd! The witness will refrain from wanton winking! ([wanton] misspelled as [wonton] in the original release)April:
Aww... Yes, Your Honor.Phoenix:
(This is not good... She's already captured the heart of every man in the court!)Edgeworth:
Tell us, where were you on the night of September 5, when the murder occurred?April:
Um... gee... I was, like, in my hotel room? Tee hee. I checked in right after lunch.Edgeworth:
And this hotel is directly across from the Fey & Co. Law Offices?April:
Mmm... that's right, big boy.Judge:
Please testify to the court about what you saw.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --April:
It was, like, 9:00 at night. I looked out the window, y'know!
And then, oooh! I saw a woman with long hair being attacked!
The one attacking her was the mousey girl sitting in the defendant's chair!
Then the woman, like, dodged to one side and ran away!
But that girl, she caught up to her and... and... She hit her!
Then the woman with long hair...
She kinda... slumped.
The end. That's all I saw. Every little bitsy witsy! *wink*Judge:
Hmm...Edgeworth:
Well, Your Honor?Judge:
I see. It is a remarkably solid testimony. I don't see a need to trouble the witness any...Phoenix:
W-wait, Your Honor!Judge:
Yes, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:
What about my cross-examination!?Judge:
I thought the witness's testimony just now was quite... firm. Didn't you?Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright... I understand you were Ms. Mia Fey's understudy, were you not? You must know her techniques well. Her cowardly way of finding tiny faults in perfectly good testimonies...Phoenix:
H-hey! How dare you!Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? Will you cross-examine the witness?Yes, I'm doing it







Phoenix:
I'll gladly proceed with the cross-examination. (If only because I have a feeling Edgeworth doesn't want me to! She has to have some weakness!)
Leads to:
"Very well, you may begin your cross-examination!"No thanks







Phoenix:
No... you're right. I guess there wouldn't be much point.
Edgeworth:
Heh heh heh. I'm glad you saw the error of your ways so soon! Your Honor. The prosecution rests its case!
Phoenix:
(Wh-what? That's it!?)
Judge:
Very well.
Phoenix:
W-wait! Hold on!
Judge:
Yes, Mr. Wright? Changed your mind? Will you cross-examine the witness?
Phoenix:
Yes yes yes! (I'd better, or I'll lose on the spot!)

April:
Oh, well, um... gee!
Phoenix:
(What? That's it? She can't get out of this question that easily!)
April:
I sort of, y'know. I had a feeling!

Go for it







Phoenix:

April:
I... oooh!
Edgeworth:

Mr. Wright! I will not have you badgering my witness!
Phoenix:
B-badgering?
Edgeworth:
You insist on needling her with these trivial questions. I really don't think it should be allowed.

The one attacking her was the mousey girl sitting in the defendant's chair!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
How do you know she was the defendant?
April:
Huh? Well... y'know! S-she had a girlish physique. Women know these things. Look... I-I just know, okay?
Edgeworth:
There was only one person at the scene of the crime with a short, girlish figure. The testimony is bulletproof, Your Honor.
Phoenix:
(He's right...)



Yep, he's right







Phoenix:
(Her testimony certainly does make sense... And everyone in the court keeps siding with her. I'd better not press too hard on this one.)
Edgeworth:
So then, tell us what happened to the victim.

No one wears clothes like this on a daily basis! Except her! And I'm no expert on fashion, but her hairdo looks far from normal to me! However, the witness's testimony mentions neither of these things! The testimony is bogus!April:

W-well? Don't look so sour, Mr. Lawyer. You can't win them all.
Phoenix:
(No... but I have a feeling I'm on to something now!)Present The Thinker







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Miss May."Phoenix:
(Her previous testimony must have been what Edgeworth wanted her to say... So this was the testimony in her own words...? Time to press and squeeze the truth out of her! Figuratively, of course.)Phoenix:
Miss May. What you said just now was quite... revealing.April:
Revealing? Oooh, you'd like that, wouldn't you. Naughty Mr. Lawyer...Phoenix:
You just said that this statue of "The Thinker" was a clock. But there's no way of knowing that just by looking at it!April:
Urp!Phoenix:
Another person in much the same position as you recently called this a "clock," too... And he was found guilty... of murder!Judge:
Order! Order!Phoenix:
Miss May. Can you explain how you know this was a clock?April:
Oooh... urp!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
The witness saw the murder with her own eyes! That's all that's important here! The defense is trying to confuse the issue with trivial concerns!Judge:
Yes... yes, of course. You will withdraw your question, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:Phoenix:
But questions are all I have, Your Honor! And as you may recall, I've caught murderers with these questions before! (Well, only once...)Judge:
... ... Objection sustained. You may continue to question the witness.Phoenix:
(Whew, that was close. If he stopped me there, the trial would be over!)April:
Huh? What? So... what happens now?Phoenix:
What happens now is you answer my question! How did you know it was a clock?April:
What...! Th-that's... ...Because... I heard it? Yes! I heard it say the time!Phoenix:
So, you've been to the law offices of Fey & Co.!April:
N-n-no! Hey, I didn't say that! Why would I go there! I heard from my hotel room. Hee hee!Edgeworth:
The law offices of Fey & Co., where the murder took place, are very close to the hotel. She could easily have heard the clock!Judge:
Hmm. Well, Mr. Wright? Are you satisfied?Phoenix:
No, Your Honor! (I can't give up now!) I'm not satisfied because...She couldn't have heard it







Phoenix:
You were at the hotel! There's no way you could have heard a clock go off in the building next door!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
You have proof that she could not?
Phoenix:
Uh...
Edgeworth:
Amateurs, amateurs. Listen to me, Mr. Wright. In the courtroom, proof is everything. Without it, you have nothing. You ARE nothing.
Phoenix:
Then I would like to propose a test to see if she really could have heard...
Edgeworth:
The prosecution denies your request!
Phoenix:
Wh-what!? On what grounds?
Edgeworth:
This is a trivial matter with no direct bearing on the case at hand!
Judge:
Indeed. Objection sustained.
Phoenix:
(Damn! Time to switch directions... quick!)
Judge:
Ready to proceed, Mr. Wright?
Leads back to:
"No, Your Honor!"It couldn't have rung







Leads to:
"Your Honor, members of the court..."Phoenix:
Your Honor, members of the court... It is inconceivable that the clock in question rang!It's empty







Phoenix:
That clock is missing its clockwork!
Judge:
H-how could you possibly...?
Phoenix:
Just have a look... Right now! (Changed from [Just have a look... As soon as you can!] in the original release)
Judge:
... Oh!
Phoenix:
See anything interesting, Your Honor?
Judge:
It is as the defense says!
Leads to:
"This clock is missing its clockwork!"It's broken







Phoenix:
I-I think it's broken! That clock's busted!
Judge:
You "think"?
Phoenix:
J-just look at it! Your Honor, please examine the clock!
Judge:
Hmm... Oh!
Phoenix:
See anything interesting, Your Honor?
Judge:
Well, I'm not sure I would call this "broken," but I doubt it could ring...!
Leads to:
"This clock is missing its clockwork!"The batteries are dead







Phoenix:
The batteries on that clock must be dead!
Judge:
"Must be," Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Your Honor, if you would inspect the clock...!
Judge:
Hmm... very well. ... Oh!
Phoenix:
Well, Your Honor? Are they...?
Judge:
This clock has graver problems than dead batteries!
Leads to:
"This clock is missing its clockwork!"Judge:
This clock is missing its clockwork! It's quite empty! Mr. Wright! Would you care to explain to the court the meaning of this?Phoenix:
It is as you can see. The "clock" was empty. It couldn't have rung! Therefore, this witness... is a big, fat liar!April:
F-fat!?Phoenix:
Well, Miss May?Edgeworth:
Tsk tsk.Phoenix:
?Edgeworth:
Quite a show you've put on for us, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:
(He knew the clock was empty! Somehow... he knew!)Edgeworth:
I'm afraid you've forgotten one thing, however. Indeed, the clock is empty. As you say... it can't ring. However, we must ask: when was the clockwork removed? If it was after the witness heard the clock, then there is no contradiction!Judge:
! Hmm! That's true. That is a possibility. The clock might have been emptied after she heard it.Edgeworth:
And that is exactly what happened, Your Honor!Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? Can you prove when the clockwork was removed?Edgeworth:
Ho hoh! Impossible, of course...Phoenix:
I have proof.Edgeworth:
W-what!?Phoenix:
Wasn't it you who told me "proof is everything"? Well, I was listening. And now I'll show you the "proof" you like so much! The evidence that proves when the clockwork was removed is...Present Maya's Cell Phone







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Take a look at this!"Present anything else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What do you say to that?
April:
W-what? I don't rightly understand what that's supposed to mean!
Judge:
I don't rightly understand either.
Edgeworth:
Ho hoh!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh... I think I blew it.)
Judge:
Mr. Wright, please refrain from flippant presentations of evidence in the future.
Phoenix:
S-sorry, Your Honor!
Leads back to:
"The evidence that proves when the clockwork was removed is..."Phoenix:
Take a look at this!Judge:
Hmm. That's a very cute cell phone.April:
Ooh hoo! You have a girlie phone!Phoenix:
W-wait! Wait! This isn't my phone! Listen! This is the defendant's cell phone, and it contains a recording... A recording of a conversation she had with the victim on the day of the murder!Judge:
Order! Order!Edgeworth:
The defendant's cell phone!? Th-this wasn't brought to my attention!Phoenix:
Perhaps Detective Gumshoe overlooked it?Edgeworth:
*grumble* (The good detective better remember he's up for evaluation soon...)Phoenix:
(I gotta say, I'm starting to feel bad for the big fella.) (Changed from [My heart goes out to you, Edgeworth. Not.] in the original release) Let's hear the conversation.Cellular:*beep*...Maya:
[So you just want me to hold on to "The Thinker" for you, then?]Mia:
[If you could. Ah... I should probably tell you, the clock isn't talking right now.]Maya:
[Huh? It's not working? That's lame!]Mia:
[I had to take the clockwork out, sorry.]...[September 5, 9:27 AM]Cellular:*beep*Phoenix:
Your Honor, I think this makes it clear the clockwork was already gone by the time this was recorded, (Changed from [I think this recording makes it clear that the clockwork was already gone...] in the original release) which was well before the witness even arrived at her hotel! (Changed from [and this was recorded in the morning, before the witness even arrived at her hotel!] in the original release)April:
Muh... muh... muh!?Phoenix:
Well, Miss May? Would you care to explain this to the court? Just how did you know that weapon was a clock!?April:
... W-well...! Well, isn't it o-obvious? I saw that clock before! Um... what store was that again? I-I go to so many! Oops! I forgot! *wink*Judge:
So the witness had seen it before. That would make sense. Does the defense have any objections, Mr. Wright?Yes







Leads to:
"The witness claims she had "seen it before.""No







Phoenix:
Oh right... well, if she had seen it before, I guess... (Wait a second!)
Judge:
Then, the court would like--
Phoenix:
Hold on! P-please wait, Your Honor!
Judge:
Y-yes...? So you do have an objection?
Phoenix:
Um, yes, well...
Judge:
Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Sorry, Your Honor, it's just...
Leads to:
"The witness claims she had "seen it before.""Phoenix:
The witness claims she had "seen it before." But this directly contradicts a piece of evidence already submitted to this court!Judge:
Well then, let's see it. Please produce this evidence that will prove the witness had not seen the clock before.Present The Thinker







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"It's simple."Present anything else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Here is undeniable proof!
Edgeworth:
Hah!? Please, this is a court case, not some surrealist performance art piece!
Judge:
Hmm... Perhaps the defense would like to change its mind?
Leads back to:
"Please produce this evidence that will prove the witness had not seen the clock before."Phoenix:
It's simple. This clock was never in any store, ever!April:
W-whaaat!?Phoenix:
A friend of mine made that clock. Only two exist in the world. And the one that isn't here is in police custody!April:
I-impossible! Everything is sold in stores!Phoenix:
Miss May, I think it's high time you went shopping for a better excuse...?April:
Mmpf...Phoenix:
Oh? Excuses not on sale today?April:
Oooh? Oh ho ho. Mmmrrrrph! Ooooorrrrrrr ggggghhhhhhh... hhh!!! What's it to you, porcupine-head!? That stupid clock doesn't matter, okay!? She did it! And she should die for it! Die!Judge:
W-w-whoa! Let's not get ahead of ourselves. T-this is a court of law, and the witness will remain calm!April:
Hrrrgh... hrrrh... Hrrr... heh. Oh? Oh! Oh? Oh hoh ho! S-silly me! *grunt* Did I, um, like... lose it? I guess I did. Tee hee! *wink*Phoenix:
(S-scary...)Judge:
Miss May, let me ask. Tell me, how did you know the weapon was a clock?April:
...Judge:
Hmm... oh dear. Does the defense have an opinion on this... behavior?Phoenix:
(Okay, this is it!) Yes, Your Honor. Allow me to explain how I see the truth of the matter. Miss April May, you knew the weapon was a clock because...You held it







Phoenix:
(This is familiar territory. I'll just use the same approach as with Larry.) Miss May held that very clock in her hands!
Judge:
Mr. Wright! When was this!?
Phoenix:
When she used it to strike the victim! When else?
Judge:
Order! Order! Mr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!?
Phoenix:
April May, you killed Mia Fey, I say! And when you struck, the force of the impact made "The Thinker" ring! That's when you heard it!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
... Tsk tsk. You truly are a work of art, Mr. Phoenix Wright.
Phoenix:
W-what's that supposed to mean!?
Edgeworth:
It was you who just proved that "The Thinker" was empty!
Phoenix:
Oh... (Urk! Of course it wouldn't ring!)
Edgeworth:
What's more, the witness has a rock-solid alibi. Miss May? Perhaps you could explain to the poor, misguided Mr. Wright? You were in the hotel at the time of the murder.
Phoenix:
(S-she can't prove it! She did it!)
April:
It would be MY pleasure!
Phoenix:
N-no way!
April:
Yes way, Mr. Lawyer. Tee hee? Didn't the murder take place at 9:00 at night? Gee, that's the exact time I ordered some room service from the hotel bellboy!
Edgeworth:
Incidentally, the bellboy corroborates the witness's story. Ergo, she was not at the crime scene! Rock solid!
Judge:
Mr. Wright! You've just made a serious accusation to a perfectly innocent woman!
Phoenix:
S-sorry, Your Honor. (That... didn't go so well. But, if that's the case... Then how did she know "The Thinker" was a clock!? ... Wait!) Your Honor, I figured it out! There is one other way Miss April May could have known it was a clock! One way alone! And I have proof!
Judge:
Well... proof, you say? Then, the court will examine your proof, Mr. Wright. How did the witness know "The Thinker" was a clock?



Present Maya's Cell Phone







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
The defendant's cell phone.
Judge:
Yes, we've seen that already.
Phoenix:
Take another listen to the conversation between the defendant and victim.
Cellular:

Maya:
[Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while.]
Mia:
[Well, actually there's something I want you to hold on to for me.]
Maya:
[Again? What's it this time?]
Mia:
[It's... a clock. It's made to look like that statue, "The Thinker." And it tells you the time!]

...

Judge:
They do mention "The Thinker." But how would the witness know of this conversation? Do you have proof that she knew of the conversation?



Present Wiretap







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Have a look at this."




Present anything else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
(Wait... no, this can't be right! I can't afford any mistakes now!)
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Your evidence, please!
Leads back to:
"Do you have proof that she knew of the conversation?"


Phoenix:
Have a look at this.
April:
Ah! Oooh! Th-that!? Eh heh...
Phoenix:
I found this in Miss May's room.
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Please explain to the court what this is!
Phoenix:
Miss April May! You used a wiretap to listen to this conversation! That's how you knew "The Thinker" was a clock! Am I wrong!?
April:
I... I...
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Your Honor, this is ridiculous!
Phoenix:
Your Honor, look at the witness's face? Does she seem amused to you!? The defense demands an answer.
April:
La... laaa... lrrrrgf!
Judge:
Witness, answer the question. Did you tap her phone?
April:
...
Judge:
Miss May!
April:
Shut up, all of you! What gives you the right to talk to ME like that! You... you LAWYER!
......
April:
I-it's no fair! All of you g-ganging up on me like that... Oh, so I'm the bad girl, is that it? Is that it!? Uh... uh... uwaaaaaaah!
Phoenix:
(That did it! The court's seen the real Miss April May now! Now to deal the final blow!)



You did it, didn't you?







Phoenix:
Miss May, confess. You did it, didn't you?
April:
Are you out of your mind!? Oh wait, I forgot... you're a lawyer! You must be! At the time of the murder... I was in my hotel room, getting room service! How could I have killed her? If you don't believe me, just ask the bellboy!
Leads to:
"Well, does the defense have anything to say?"




Why the wiretap?







Phoenix:
Miss May... Why did you tap her phone?
April:
...
Phoenix:
Answer the question!
April:
Do I have to? Isn't this a murder trial? Isn't tippity-tapping er... irrelevant?
Phoenix:
(Gah! She's saying exactly what Edgeworth wants her to say.) Miss May. You were tapping the victim's phone! I hardly call that "irrelevant"!
Judge:
While this court does not condone the defense's tone of voice, he has a point. (Changed from [While this court does not condone the defense's tone of speech, he has a point.] in the original release) Well, Miss May? Do you have an explanation for the court? Can you prove you had nothing to do with this murder, even though you tapped her phone?
April:
At the time of the murder... I was in my hotel room, getting room service! How could I have killed her? If you don't believe me, just ask the bellboy!
Leads to:

April:
Oooh. Oooooh!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Your Honor, This is irrelevant!
Judge:
I'm not entirely sure that it is. Objection overruled. It troubles me that our witness was in possession of a wiretap.
Edgeworth:
This is outrageous! Does the defense truly claim that the witness was tapping her phone?
Phoenix:
Absolutely!
Edgeworth:
Even if that was the case, (which it's not) you still have to prove one thing! Did the victim ever say that the weapon was a clock on the phone? Can you prove that? I THINK NOT!
Phoenix:
Oh yeah? I THINK I CAN! It's simple!
Edgeworth:
WHAAAAT!?
Phoenix:
Here's my proof. The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is...



Present Maya's Cell Phone







Phoenix:

"I present the defendant's cell phone."

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
This! I think...
Judge:
That's not going to prove anything, Mr. Wright. I think...
Phoenix:
W-wait! That was just a warm up!
Judge:
Hmm! Okay, once again. And I expect real proof this time!
Leads back to:
"The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is..."


Phoenix:
I present the defendant's cell phone.

Yes, we've seen that.

Phoenix:
This evidence reveals the truth of the matter!
Judge:
What does it reveal, exactly?
Edgeworth:
The mad delusions of the defense, perhaps?
Phoenix:
(Uh oh, bad reaction. Maybe that wasn't the thing...)
Judge:
I'm afraid it has revealed a certain over-eagerness... Let me ask again:
Leads back to:
"How did the witness know "The Thinker" was a clock?"You had heard about it







Phoenix:
The witness had never held the clock in her hand! However, she had heard that it was a clock!
Judge:
She "heard"...?
Phoenix:
That is correct, Your Honor. There is no other way she could have known "The Thinker" was a clock! And I can show you the proof!
Judge:
Well, this is interesting. Let's see it, then. Show me evidence proving that the witness had "heard" the murder weapon was a clock.

What is it you little shrimp! Talk to me in that tone of voice will you!?
Phoenix:
You killed her, didn't you!
Judge:
Order! There will be order!
April:
What? How can you possibly say that!? Are you mad? A-all I did was a little wiretap... Oops!
Phoenix:
So you admit you tapped her phone!
April:
Heh... heh... hrrah! B-but wait! I didn't do ANYTHING bad like murder! I'm a good girl!
Phoenix:
Really? Can you prove it!? (No way can she prove it!)
April:
You think you're so smart, Mr. Lawyer... But I can prove it! And I will!
Phoenix:
You can't be serious! No way!
April:
Way, I say! Way! Oh, and I assure you I'm serious, Mr. Lawyer! Hmph! Okay? So, the killing happened around 9:00 at night? Why, that's just when I was getting room service from that sweet bellboy...
Phoenix:
R-room service!?
April:
Ice coffee, I believe it was? Ice coffee? You know? Like normal coffee, but COLD. If you don't drink it quick, the ice melts and then you have... regular cold coffee.
Phoenix:
I-ice coffee...!?
April:
Think I'm making this up? Ask the bellboy! *wink*
Edgeworth:
Ergo, the witness was not on the scene at the time of the murder!
Phoenix:
!
Judge:
So, where does that leave us...?
Edgeworth:
It is my great displeasure to inform you... That the witness appears to have been tapping the victim's telephone. However! That is a separate crime, with no bearing on the current case whatsoever! Her testimony stands! She saw the defendant, Maya Fey, commit murder!

April:
Well you're not the first man who's thought that! And of course... I can, and will!

Present anything else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
This! I think...
Judge:
That's not going to prove anything, Mr. Wright. I think...
Phoenix:
W-wait! That was just a warm up!
Judge:
Hmm! Okay, once again. And I expect real proof this time!
Leads back to:
"The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is..."


Phoenix:
I present the defendant's cell phone.
Judge:
Yes, we've seen that.
Phoenix:
Listen once more to the conversation between the defendant and the victim.
Cellular:

*beep*
...

Maya:
[Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while.]
Mia:
[Well, actually there's something I want you to hold on to for me.]
Maya:
[Again? What's it this time?]
Mia:
[It's... a clock. It's made to look like that statue, "The Thinker." And it tells you the time!]

...

Phoenix:
Miss April May! You used a wiretap to listen to this conversation! That's how you knew "The Thinker" was a clock! Am I wrong!?
April:
I... I...
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Your Honor, this is ridiculous!
Phoenix:
Your Honor, look at the witness's face? Does she seem amused to you!? The defense demands an answer.
April:
La... laaa... lrrrrgf!
Judge:
Witness, answer the question. Did you tap her phone?
April:
...
Judge:
Miss May!
April:
Shut up, all of you! What gives you the right to talk to ME like that! You... you LAWYER!
......
April:
I-it's no fair! All of you g-ganging up on me like that... Oh, so I'm the bad girl, is that it? Is that it!? Uh... uh... uwaaaaaaah!
Phoenix:
(That did it! The court's seen the real Miss April May now! Now to deal the final blow!)



You did it, didn't you?







Phoenix:
Miss May!
April:
What is it you little shrimp! Talk to me in that tone of voice will you!?
Phoenix:
You killed her, didn't you!
Judge:
Order! There will be order!
April:
What? How can you possibly say that!? Are you mad? A-all I did was a little wiretap... Oops!
Phoenix:
So you admit you tapped her phone!
April:
Heh... heh... hrrah! B-but wait! I didn't do ANYTHING bad like murder! I'm a good girl!
Phoenix:
Really? Can you prove it!? (No way can she prove it!)
April:
You think you're so smart, Mr. Lawyer... But I can prove it! And I will!
Phoenix:
You can't be serious! No way!
April:
Way, I say! Way! Oh, and I assure you I'm serious, Mr. Lawyer! Hmph! Okay? So, the killing happened around 9:00 at night? Why, that's just when I was getting room service from that sweet bellboy...
Phoenix:
R-room service!?
April:
Ice coffee, I believe it was? Ice coffee? You know? Like normal coffee, but COLD. If you don't drink it quick, the ice melts and then you have... regular cold coffee.
Phoenix:
I-ice coffee...!?
April:
Think I'm making this up? Ask the bellboy! *wink*
Edgeworth:
Ergo, the witness was not on the scene at the time of the murder!
Phoenix:
!
Judge:
So, where does that leave us...?
Edgeworth:
It is my great displeasure to inform you... That the witness appears to have been tapping the victim's telephone. However! That is a separate crime, with no bearing on the current case whatsoever! Her testimony stands! She saw the defendant, Maya Fey, commit murder!
Phoenix:
(No! They're going to let her just walk away! There's no way I can win this unless I tie Miss May to the murder somehow...)
Leads to:
"Well, does the defense have anything to say?"




Why the wiretap?







Phoenix:
Why did you tap her phone?
April:
...
Phoenix:
Answer the question!
April:
Do I have to? Isn't this a murder trial? Isn't tippity-tapping er... irrelevant?
Phoenix:
(Gah! She's saying exactly what Edgeworth wants her to say.) Miss May. You were tapping the victim's phone! I hardly call that "irrelevant"!
Judge:
While this court does not condone the defense's tone of voice, he has a point. (Changed from [While this court does not condone the defense's tone of speech, he has a point.] in the original release) Well, Miss May? Do you have an explanation for the court? Can you prove you had nothing to do with this murder, even though you tapped her phone?
Phoenix:
(Hah! I'd like to see her pull THAT off!)
April:
Mr. Lawyer, I saw that evil, evil grin! You were probably thinking "I'd like to see her pull THAT off," weren't you!
Phoenix:
(Damn... she's good!)
April:
Well you're not the first man who's thought that! And of course... I can, and will!
Phoenix:
You can't be serious! No way!
April:
Way, I say! Way! Oh, and I assure you I'm serious, Mr. Lawyer! Hmph! Okay? So, the killing happened around 9:00 at night? Why, that's just when I was getting room service from that sweet bellboy...
Phoenix:
R-room service!?
April:
Ice coffee, I believe it was? Ice coffee? You know? Like normal coffee, but COLD. If you don't drink it quick, the ice melts and then you have... regular cold coffee.
Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Well, does the defense have anything to say?"





Present anything else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
This is my evidence!
Judge:
I'm afraid I'm not sure where you are going with all of this, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Um... "where"? Well, it's not so much a place as a... er...
Edgeworth:
Come to the end of your bluff, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
W-wait! Wait! That was, uh, practice! Here's the real evidence!
Judge:
Mr. Wright, this court does not condone the presentation of evidence for "practice." Let's see your evidence, for real this time, Mr. Wright.
Leads back to:
"Show me evidence proving that the witness had "heard" the murder weapon was a clock."Judge:
Well, does the defense have anything to say?Phoenix:
Um, well... (Come on, think of something!)Call the bellboy as a witness







Phoenix:
The defense would like to call the hotel bellboy as a witness! There's something suspicious there, and I'm going to get to the bottom of it!
April:
I think you've sunken quite low enough already.
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
I object to calling the bellboy!
Phoenix:
W-why? What's your reason?
Edgeworth:
Because I hold that the wiretapping had nothing to do with the killing!
Phoenix:
...!
Edgeworth:
However... If you agree to one condition, I'll consent to calling this witness.
Phoenix:
Condition...?
Edgeworth:
If Miss April May's alibi is not called into question after you examine the bellboy... Then you will recognize that Miss April May was not the killer, thus she is innocent! Therefore you must accept the verdict of "guilty" for Ms. Maya Fey! That is my condition.
Phoenix:
(What...!? I'd better find something suspicious in that bellboy's testimony... Otherwise Maya will be declared "guilty" on the spot! What should I do...?)



Accept the condition







Phoenix:
(Alright! I've got nothing to lose! Except for... well, everything!) Understood. I accept your condition.
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Fool... You fell right into my trap!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh!) Uh... um, wait...
Leads to:
"Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand!"




Give up







Phoenix:
(Grr! I can't accept those conditions!) Very well. The defense will refrain from calling the bellboy as a witness.
Judge:
I see. You may continue your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Right. On with the cross-examination.
Edgeworth:
What exactly do you have left to examine, Mr. Wright? Miss April May has admitted to the wiretap, yes. But that bears no relevance to the case at hand: murder! There's no way you can prove any connection!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh! Think! This can't be the end... but I'm out of evidence!)
Judge:
Then I believe the cross-examination is over. Mr. Edgeworth, does the prosecution have any other witnesses to call?
Edgeworth:
None, Your Honor. She's the last.
Phoenix:
(What!? B-but that means... Maya's guilty...!?) W-wait! Your Honor!
Judge:
Yes, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
The defense would like to call the bellboy after all!
Edgeworth:
... Tsk tsk tsk... As I thought!
Phoenix:
...?
Edgeworth:
May I remind you, dear Mr. Wright. Should you question the bellboy... and Miss April May's alibi prove to be solid... then, by default, your client Ms. Maya Fey will be pronounced "guilty"! Are you prepared to accept my condition?
Phoenix:
(Edgeworth... He's got me backed into a corner... But I don't see any other way to take this!) I accept!
Leads to:
"Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand!"Continue examining Miss May







Phoenix:
Right. On with the cross-examination.
Edgeworth:
What exactly do you have left to examine, Mr. Wright? Miss April May has admitted to the wiretap, yes. But that bears no relevance to the case at hand: murder! There's no way you can prove any connection!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh! Think! This can't be the end... but I'm out of evidence!)

Then I believe the cross-examination is over. Mr. Edgeworth, does the prosecution have any other witnesses to call?
Edgeworth:
None, Your Honor. She's the last.

Yes, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
The defense would like to call the bellboy after all!

Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand!Edgeworth:
I believe we're ready for the witness to testify. He certainly does look like a bellboy.Bellboy:
Yes, sir. I received your summons in the middle of work, sir. I'm happy to be of service.Judge:
That tea set looks rather heavy, so without further ado, the witness may begin his testimony.Bellboy:
Very good, sir!Witness Testimony-- Miss May's Room Service --Bellboy:
I am the head bellboy at the fine Gatewater Hotel, in business for four generations!
I believe I received a call after 8:00 in the evening from our guest, Miss May.
She asked for an ice coffee to be brought to her at 9:00, on the dot, sir.
I brought it to her at precisely the requested time, of course.
And I delivered the ice coffee to our guest Miss May, herself.Judge:
I see. The defense may begin its cross-examination.Phoenix:
R-right! I'm ready. (I hope... This is it... If I can't prove Miss May was involved with the murder now... Maya will be finished!)Cross Examination-- Miss May's Room Service --Bellboy:

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What exactly is it you do at the hotel?
Bellboy:
Why, anything required of me, sir. I check in guests, I check out guests. I clean rooms, I make beds. I even deliver room service, sir. I checked Miss May in personally.
Phoenix:
Are you always so... so prim?
Judge:
Mr. Wright. You will refrain from asking frivolous questions...Bellboy:
I believe I received a call after 8:00 in the evening from our guest, Miss May.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Are you sure it was Miss May on the phone?
Bellboy:
Absolutely, sir.
Phoenix:
H-how can you be so certain!?
Bellboy:
I checked Miss May in personally, sir. Not only did I see her in all her stunning radiance, but I also heard her voice. And then I saw THEM, and I... Ahem. Er... ahem! The point being, I remembered her quite well, sir.
Judge:
Yes, what then?Bellboy:
She asked for an ice coffee to be brought to her at 9:00, on the dot, sir.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
9:00 "on the dot," you say?
Bellboy:
Yes. I confirmed that detail several times. She was watching a program on the TV, and wished to drink after she finished, sir.
Phoenix:
(9:00... the time of the murder!)Bellboy:
I brought it to her at precisely the requested time, of course.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
"Precisely" 9:00, then?
Bellboy:
Precisely, exactly, and most definitely, sir, 9:00 PM.
Phoenix:
How can you be so sure!?
Bellboy:
Miss May was quite insistent that it be brought then. "Oh, bellboy? Tee hee! I'd like, like, ice coffee at exactly 9:00!" Something like that, sir. Therefore, I knocked on her door at the crack of 9:00, sir.
Phoenix:
(Why would she be so particular about the time?)Bellboy:
And I delivered the ice coffee to our guest Miss May, herself.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
You are sure it was Miss April May herself?
Bellboy:
Ab-SO-lutely, sir.
Phoenix:
"Ab-SO-lutely"...?
Bellboy:
Yes, sir. As in, "so very absolutely," sir. It's an endearing mannerism of mine.
Phoenix:
How come you're so very certain!?
Bellboy:
Well, when I brought the room service, sir... S-she... the guest, sir, favored me w-with a, um, an "embrasser," sir.
Phoenix:
"Embrasser"!? Is that French for "embrace"?
Bellboy:
It's French for "kiss," sir. But not a french kiss, sir! More of a peck on the cheek.
Phoenix:
Wh-why would she have done that...?
Bellboy:
I believe, perhaps, she was momentarily swayed by my prim demeanor, sir. It was a moment I shall never, ever forget, sir.
Phoenix:
(Sounds pretty fishy to me... I think our Miss May was up to something and wanted the bellboy to remember her!)Phoenix:
(This bellboy wouldn't have any reason to lie... But I have to find something to use in his testimony! One more time. I'll press him until he spills the beans... or his tea!)After pressing fourth and fifth statements:Phoenix:
... It's no good! (There's nothing there! Is... is that it!?)Edgeworth:
Tsk tsk. Finally, you understand. This bellboy has absolutely no reason to lie! Now... If you have any decency, you will end this rather tedious cross-examination here!Judge:
Hmm. It was a bit tedious. The witness may leave the stand.Phoenix:

One last question... let me ask one last question!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
Your Honor, I must object. This charade of justice has gone on long enough!Judge:
Now, now, Mr. Edgeworth. Alright Mr. Wright. I'll give you one more question, that's all.Phoenix:
(Okay. This is really it, now. This is my last chance! What do I ask him about...!?)Check-in







Phoenix:
T-tell me about check-in! Tell me about when you checked-in Miss May.
Bellboy:
Oh, alright. Very well, sir. My first thought was that she was a beautiful, beautiful person. She's just my type of girl, so it was a disappointment, really.
Phoenix:
I see... ? Excuse me... what exactly was a "disappointment"?
Bellboy:
Well, I am not without charm, sir, but even I'd have little chance with her lover there.
Phoenix:
(...! What did he say!?) What did you say!?
Bellboy:
Ah! Oh... er... rather, quite!
Phoenix:
Bellboy! Tell us the truth now... Did Miss May check in with another person?
Edgeworth:

Leads to:
"I object! That was... objectionable!"Room service







Phoenix:
T-tell me again about er... room service!
Bellboy:
A-again, sir? At exactly 9:00, I delivered room service to Miss May in room 303. The guest had requested ice coffee... $18 was the charge, as I recall.
Phoenix:
I see... ...? E-eighteen dollars? Doesn't that seem a bit expensive?
Bellboy:
Y-yes, well, ice coffee for two, you know. And we don't skimp on the ice, sir.
Phoenix:
(...! What did he say!?) What did you say!?
Bellboy:
Ah! Oh... er... rather, quite!
Phoenix:
Bellboy! Tell us the truth now... Was someone else staying in Miss May's room?
Edgeworth:

Leads to:
"I object! That was... objectionable!"Bed making







Phoenix:
Bed... bed making! Tell me about making beds that day.
Edgeworth:
I was wondering what you were going to ask, but bed making? A new low!
Judge:
Now, now, Mr. Edgeworth. The witness will answer the defense's question.
Bellboy:
Yes, well, it was quite like any other day's bed making. I changed the sheets, the pillowcases, and then I proceeded to make the bed. I had to bring pillows for two, of course, but they're quite light, you see.
Phoenix:
I see. Thank you. ... (Pillows... for two!?) Bellboy! What did you just say?
Bellboy:
Eh!? Ah, yes, pillows are light... sir?
Phoenix:
Bellboy! Tell us the truth now... Was someone else staying in Miss May's room?
Edgeworth:

Leads to:
"I object! That was... objectionable!"Edgeworth:
I object! That was... objectionable!Judge:
... Objection overruled. The witness will answer the question.Bellboy:
Er... yes, I see.Phoenix:
Why did you not mention this in your testimony!?Bellboy:
W-well, sir, you er... you didn't ask!Phoenix:
(Nice try!) That's the sort of thing you're normally supposed to mention!Bellboy:
Ah, yes, quite. Indeed... It was the, er, good barrister there, Mr. Edgeworth, who...Phoenix:
!Bellboy:
He asked me not to mention it if I wasn't specifically asked, sir.Edgeworth:
Oof! Y-you fool!Phoenix:
I've done it... I've won!Phoenix:
Miss April May checked into a twin room... with a man. Correct?Bellboy:
Yes, sir.Phoenix:
Then, when you brought them room service, you didn't see that man in the room...?Bellboy:
That's right, sir.Judge:
Hmm...Phoenix:
Your Honor! We have just learned of another person involved who may have been the murderer! In light of this new fact, I hold that it's impossible to judge the defendant. (Changed from [In this new light, I hold that it's impossible to judge the defendant.] in the original release) You agree, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:
And who, Mr. Wright! Who is this "other person"! (Changed from [Who! Who is this 'other person'!] in the original release)Phoenix:
Simple, it was...Miss April May







Phoenix:
None other than Miss April May!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Eh!? Have you heard nothing that has transpired so far!? She has an alibi! She was in the hotel at the time of the murder!
Phoenix:
Oh... right.
Judge:
Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
S-sorry, Your Honor! Give me one more chance!

"Simple, it was..."The man with Miss May







Leads to:
"The man who checked in with Miss May!"The Bellboy







Phoenix:
It was the bellboy and none other!
Judge:
Well, this comes as some surprise...
Edgeworth:
Your Honor, Mr. Wright... It was the bellboy who confirmed Miss May's alibi... And this in turn confirms the bellboy's alibi! He was in the hotel!
Phoenix:
Well, s-sure... if you put it that way...
Edgeworth:
I do put it that way, and I trust you will too!
Phoenix:
But what if they were in cahoots!
Judge:
You have evidence of this?
Phoenix:
Um... no, Your Honor.
Judge:
Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
S-sorry, Your Honor! Give me one more chance!
Leads back to:
"Simple, it was..."Phoenix:
The man who checked in with Miss May!Edgeworth:
Oof!Phoenix:
Your Honor! As has been previously revealed, Miss April May was tapping the victim's phone. Yet Miss May herself has an alibi at the time of the murder. However, that does not clear the man that was with her! The bellboy saw no one else in the room at the time of the murder!!!Edgeworth:
M-my, what a convenient little setup... but it's too late...Phoenix:
"Too late"? I suppose you'd like it if it was too late, wouldn't you... After all, it was you who hid the presence of the other man from this court!Edgeworth:
Oof! Upstart... amateur...! T-these accusations are... ludicrous!Judge:
Enough! The court acknowledges the defense's argument. I expect the prosecution and defense to look into this matter fully! Am I understood?Edgeworth:
Yes... *gasp* Yes, Your Honor.Judge:

Huh?Maya:

So, what happens with me? Do I get to go home now?Phoenix:
Um, well... (Changed from [Well, no.] in the original release) No, I don't think so. Not yet. (Changed from [I don't think so. Not yet.] in the original release)Maya:
Oh... I see.Phoenix:
But I got a great lead in today's trial!Maya:
A "lead"?Phoenix:
That man with Miss May! He's the key!Maya:
Oh! I get it. What happened to Miss May after that, anyway?Phoenix:
I heard they arrested her. I guess she's learning her charms won't work everywhere. She's probably at the detention center now. I may have to go down there later. Anyway. This case is far from closed.Maya:
Yes sir!Phoenix:
I'm going to find out more about this man.Maya:
Do you think he was the one who...?Phoenix:
Maybe so.Maya:
Sis...Phoenix:
Don't worry, I'll find him by tomorrow. I promise.Maya:
I'm counting on you!Phoenix:
I asked for a full record of April May's testimony. I thought it might come in handy during the trial tomorrow. But now that I have it, I'm not so sure. Most of her testimony was all lies... In fact, there's only one part that hasn't been stricken from the record. (Changed from [In fact, there's only one part that got left on the record.] in the original release)May Testimony added to the Court Record.Phoenix:
I don't know how much good this will do me at all, now. Anyway, time to hit the pavement and do some investigating! Maya doesn't belong in that detention center, and it's up to me to set her free!

Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
Judge:
... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Ugh. I must be on the wrong track?)Too many penalties







Judge:
That's enough! This court see no reason to further prolong the trial. The defense has failed to give the court sufficient reason to doubt the prosecution's claim! This court find the defendant, Ms. Maya Fey...

Guilty

Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!Turnabout Sisters

Well hello! I didn't expect anyone to visit me in such a dank place as this... It's really quite... moving. Not! You stinking lawyer! I hope you die! Have you come to laugh? Yes, laugh at the fallen Miss May!Phoenix:
No, not really, there's something I wanted to ask.April:
Unfortunately, there is nothing I want to BE asked. Haven't you done enough questioning, you...! Spiky-head!Phoenix:
(Here we go again...) Please, you're scaring the security guard.April:
... So? What is it you wish to ask of me, then? Hmm?Phoenix:
(For starters, how did you get to be so totally whacked!?)Examine









Security camera







Phoenix:
Smile for the camera...




Security guard







Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch. A real pro, this guy. Or maybe he just doesn't get to see a lot of women like Miss May in here.Talk









That "man"







Phoenix:
About the man who stayed with you in your hotel room...
April:
...
Phoenix:
Can you tell me about him? Where is he? C'mon...
April:
No way, Jose.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... maybe if I had something to get her to talk...)




The wiretap







Phoenix:
Why did you place a wiretap on Mia's phone?
April:
Aww, when you say it like that it sounds so... cold. So criminal!
Phoenix:
Um... tapping people's phones is a crime, Miss May.
April:
Oh, and I suppose you learned that in Lawyer School, hmm? Creep!
Phoenix:
(This woman is impossible to talk to...)




Your attitude







Phoenix:
Say... Why are you so... angry? I mean, you don't look like a bad person...
April:
Ooh, that does it! Bottom-feeding, scum-sucking lawyer!
Phoenix:
B-bottom...? (I can't tell, does she have a thing against lawyers... or just against me?)Present









Anything







April:
Hey, guess what. Actually, I, um, really hate your guts. So get lost. Because, well, I'm not cooperating.
Phoenix:
(Thanks, I noticed.)September 7Fey & Co. Law OfficesPhoenix:
Looks like forensics is taking the day off today. Detective Gumshoe's nowhere in sight. The police really gave this place a working over. I doubt there are any valuable clues left. Suppose it can't hurt to take a look around, though.Examine









Bookshelf







Phoenix:
You couldn't cram more legal books in here, even if you wanted to. All the cases that the chief worked on are filed here. Hmm. Are some of the files missing...? Nah, I'm imagining things.September 7Grossberg Law OfficesPhoenix:
(Huh. Looks like Grossberg is out today... again. Maybe he's avoiding me for some reason?)Examine









Photos on desk







Phoenix:
What's this? Old photos? There are two lying here. Something's been written in pencil on the backs. "DL-6 Incident - Exhibit A," "DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B"... Let's take a look at these...



"DL-6 Incident - Exhibit A"







Phoenix:
... I'm sure I've seen this person somewhere... Perhaps I'll borrow this photo. I'm sure no one will miss just one little photo. And it might be a valuable clue... I'll take it for now.
Photograph quietly added to the Court Record.
Leads back to examination




"DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B"







Phoenix:
Why would Grossberg have a picture of this man...? This might be a valuable clue... I'll take it for now. I'm just borrowing it. I'll return it later.
Photograph quietly added to the Court Record.
Leads back to examination




Leave them alone







Phoenix:
I don't need it now, whatever it is. If I ever run out of clues, I'll know where to find these. (Although I can't be sure the photos will still be here then...)
Leads back to examination





Photos on desk (after one has been added to the Court Record)







Phoenix:
A photo lies on the desk. Maybe I should switch it with the one I took?



Swap photos







Phoenix:
I think I'll swap them...
Photograph added to the Court Record.
Leads back to examination




Leave it alone







Phoenix:
No, on second thought, I'd better not.
Leads back to examination





Vacant wall







Phoenix:
Wait a second... Wasn't there a giant painting hanging on that wall...? Yeah... yeah, it was a painting of...



Sunflowers

"Wasn't it? It wasn't a very memorable painting, anyhow."

YOU AGAIN!? Can't you take a hint and stay gone?Phoenix:
Hey, the only reason I'm back here is because YOU won't talk to me!April:
Oh, so it's MY fault now? You don't just have spiky hair, you also have a spiky heart.Phoenix:
(That does it. When this case is done I'm shaving my head.)Talk









That "man"







Phoenix:
About the man who stayed with you in your hotel room... Can you tell me about him? Where is he?
April:
I'm not telling!
Phoenix:
Look, he's being accused of murder! I don't think you want to be protecting him.
April:
Hmm. Would you have sold out the late Ms. Fey to the cops?
Phoenix:
No.
April:
See?
Phoenix:
(Damn! Hmm... maybe if I had something to get her to talk...)Present









Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit A)







Phoenix:
Any thoughts about this photograph?
April:
... Who's that? Your mother?
Phoenix:
(... *sigh* Looks like I've just been wasting my time.)




Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B)







Phoenix:
Have a look at this.
April:
Look, I've said several times, I'm not telling you... ! Where did you...?
Phoenix:
(Ah hah! A reaction!) This is him, isn't it?
April:
What? Who? When? Why...?
Phoenix:
It IS him. This is the man who stayed in your hotel room the night of the murder!
April:
No! No, that's not right.
Phoenix:
(Nice try, Miss Cooperative.)
April:
D-do you have proof that was him? Hmm? Y-yeah! Proof! Show me proof!
Phoenix:
(I'm so close!)September 7Gatewater HotelRoom 303Bellboy:
Ah, welcome, sir! Quite the performance today, if I dare say so myself.Phoenix:
Oh, um, thanks. Sorry for putting you on the spot like that.Bellboy:
No, no, not at all, sir! Your efforts today can only help the Gatewater's "rep," as they say.Phoenix:
Huh? "Rep"?Bellboy:
Yes! Our reputation will swell as the hotel where the murderer used a wiretap! We can charge a premium for the room, of course. It will be great for business, sir!Phoenix:
Whoa, whoa! Miss May hasn't been charged with murder.Bellboy:
I, too, will become famous! "The Bellboy who brought the murderer ice coffee"...!Phoenix:
(Why do I feel like we're both stuck in the same bad dream...)Bellboy:
So! You are our honored guest. Please let me know if there is anything I can bring you!Examine









Flowers







Phoenix:
A vase, as expected. I'm not good with flower names, except maybe tulips and sunflowers.




Open drawer







Phoenix:
Huh? There's still a screwdriver stuck in that drawer!
Bellboy:
Ah, please leave that as it is, sir. That's the "Drawer of Terror, Hiding Place of the Murderer's Wiretap." It's set to become one of the most popular attractions here.
Phoenix:
(This guy's serious! I don't believe it...)




Table







Phoenix:
A bottle and two glasses rest on the table. Why hasn't he cleaned these up by now?
Bellboy:
Ah, I beg your pardon, sir, but if you could please refrain from touching those... It's part of the decor. I call it: "The last drink... before murder!" We'll be famous! The talk of the hotel industry!




Window







Phoenix:
Nice weather again today. I can see the Fey & Co. Law Offices, of course.
Bellboy:
Ah, yes. We plan to install a telescope in that window, of course. Just $5.00 will earn you three minutes of a "view to a kill"!
Phoenix:
...
Bellboy:
J-just kidding, sir. Oh hoh hoh hoh!
Phoenix:
(By that look in his eyes I'd say he was more than serious...)Talk









Miss May







Phoenix:
About Miss May...
Bellboy:
Oh, her? Sir, not to boast but I knew the moment I saw her... "She'd do it!" I said!
Phoenix:
(Do WHAT!? I'm starting to think the most suspicious person here is this guy!)




The man with May







Phoenix:
I wanted to ask you about the man who was with Miss May...?
Bellboy:
Ah, yes... He struck me as a real "Lady Killer," if you'll pardon the expression. I knew it from the moment I saw him, sir. He and I are of the same ilk. We both carry the scent of... danger.
Phoenix:
(There we are in total agreement, Mr. Psycho Bellboy.)
Bellboy:
If you had a photo of that man, I'm quite sure I could identify him.
Phoenix:
(A photo. Hmm...)




The hotel







Phoenix:
Could you tell me about this hotel?
Bellboy:
Absolutely! And on that subject, I have an excellent idea, sir! Currently, this hotel is known as the "Gatewater." I propose that we add a subtitle!
Phoenix:
A subtitle!?
Bellboy:

The Gatewater Hotel -- Murder Manor --
Well? What do you think?
Phoenix:
Um... sounds great! (Whatever floats your tea set...)Present









Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit A)







Phoenix:
What about this photo?
Bellboy:
Well, it's a fine photo, sir. However, the person Miss May was accompanied by was, well, a man.
Phoenix:
(Oh... yeah. Right.)




Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B)







Phoenix:
Take a look at this photo.
Bellboy:
... That's him, Detective.
Phoenix:
Um... I'm the lawyer.
Bellboy:
Oh, I know that! I just wanted to say "Detective" once. You know how it is.
Phoenix:
(No. No I don't.)
Bellboy:
Without a doubt, that is the man who checked in with Miss April May. How about I write an affidavit swearing that that's him!
Phoenix:
An affidavit? (This guy is way too excited about this...)



Have him write it







Phoenix:
Well, sure. Why not?
Bellboy:
Yes! I've always wanted to write an affidavit, sir. From hence forth I will be known as "The Bellboy who swore the affidavit"! (Changed from [From hence forth I will be known as the 'bellboy who swore the affidavit'!] in the original release)
Phoenix:
Just hurry up and write it.
Bellboy's Affidavit added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(Not even Miss May can play dumb to this!)
Leads back to Court Record




Turn him down







Phoenix:
Well thanks, but I don't think that will be necessary.
Bellboy:
Oh? Oh, I see. Well later then, if you need it.
Leads back to Court Record





Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B) (after Bellboy's Affidavit is added to the Court Record)







Phoenix:
Sorry to press the matter, but are you sure this is him?
Bellboy:
I, too, am sorry to press the matter, but that is him, Detective!
Phoenix:
Umm... thanks.




Bellboy's Affidavit







Phoenix:
Thanks for this.
Bellboy:
No no no, not at all, sir! I hope you'll use it to take that Miss May down hard, sir! Hard!
Phoenix:
(Why do I sense an unhealthy level of excitement behind that unchanging smile? His tea set is rattling!)




Anything else







Bellboy:
I'm sorry... All I could think about during the trial was the hotel... I wasn't paying much attention to the evidence.Grossberg Law Offices (after Bellboy's Affidavit is added to the Court Record)Phoenix:

Bellboy's Affidavit







Phoenix:
Could you have a look at this?
April:
What's that?
Phoenix:
The bellboy's affidavit! He told us everything he saw. He told us about the man you checked in with. He told us who he was.
April:
...!
Phoenix:
(Now I'm getting somewhere!)



Ease her fears







Phoenix:
(Okay, okay... she's vulnerable now. I should be gentle.) Miss May... It would be easy for me to hand this affidavit to the police.
April:
...
Phoenix:
If they get involved, wouldn't your boss be even more... er... inconvenienced? All I want to do is have a little chat with him. You won't tell me?
April:
... Is that all you have to say?
Phoenix:
Yes.
April:
Id it's so easy for you to "get the police involved," then why don't you? Somehow I think you're not up to it, hmm?
Phoenix:
(Show them a little kindness and they jump all over you! That had the opposite effect to what I hoped...)
April:
Aww. *smirk* Poor little lawyer... And you were so close!
Phoenix:
(This isn't working... I think I've worn out this piece of paper's usefulness.) Dammit!
Bellboy's Affidavit discarded. (Changed from [Discarded the Bellboy's Affidavit.] in the original release)
Phoenix:
(The man in this photo is the one I want! Why did April May not want to talk about it... she must know him!)
Leads back to Court Record




Push her hard







Phoenix:
(This is it, all or nothing! Time to do a little bluff.) No use playing dumb! (If, indeed, that's an act.) If you don't talk, I'm taking this photo to the press!
April:
Whaaaaat!?
Phoenix:
Even though he should've been witness to murder, your little "friend" is missing. (Changed from [Even though he should be a witness to murder, this man is in hiding.] in the original release) I'm sure the press would have a field day with his reputation!
April:
...! Ooooh! Fine! I'll talk! You... you win, Lawyer.
Phoenix:
(Yes! Man, that felt good! It's great to be alive!)
April:
Why are you pumping your fists in the air?
Phoenix:
*cough* Now, tell me about the man you were with.
April:
That man... He's my boss. Redd White, the president of the information gathering conglomerate, Bluecorp.
Phoenix:
(Redd... White?) "Information gathering?"
April:
Well... I suppose you could call it a detective agency. (Changed from [Well... I suppose you could call them a detective agency.] in the orignal release)
Phoenix:
Hmm... So this is the man that was with you the night of the murder?
April:
... I'm... I'm scared to talk. I don't want to end up like her!
Phoenix:
(...!) It's okay, I'll just ask Mr. White himself. Can you tell me where Bluecorp is located?
April:
...
Phoenix:
(Mr. Redd White, at last! Finally, a lead on this guy! If April May couldn't have done it, that leaves him! Time to take action!)

Open drawer







Phoenix:
The screwdriver is still stuck in the drawer. I'd better not touch it. No telling what the bellboy would do to me.

Ah hah! You again.Phoenix:
Um, hello, Mr. Grossberg.Grossberg:
... Well, well. You were quite the thing, my boy.Phoenix:
Excuse me...?Grossberg:
The trial! The trial!Phoenix:
(He was there...?)Grossberg:
Reminded me of myself when I was a youth!Phoenix:
(I guess something got passed down through Mia... maybe?)Grossberg:
It brings back memories, it does! "Ah... the days of my youth... like the scent of fresh lemon..." you see. ... I apologize.Phoenix:
?Grossberg:
I... It was all a bit too much for me, my boy. Seeing you today, I... well, I... ...Phoenix:
(I appreciate the reminiscing, but I'd much rather you gave me some information!)Talk









Today's trial







Phoenix:
So you came to see the trial?
Grossberg:
Yes, yes I did. Something was bothering me all last night, you see. I couldn't get a wink of sleep.
Phoenix:
Really? What was that?
Grossberg:
Well, you see, it's just... Mia's sister, that poor girl. My boy, I owe you my thanks, truly. I don't know what I would have done if things had gone poorly for the girl.
Phoenix:
(If you were that worried about it, why didn't you offer to defend her!?)




Your refusal







Phoenix:
I asked before, but, why did you refuse her request for defense? I think I have a right to know.
Grossberg:
A right, Mr. Wright? No, no, I'm sorry. It's just, I need more time to think about it, my boy.
Phoenix:
... (He does seem troubled about something... Maybe I can find something that will inspire him to talk.)




That painting







Phoenix:
The other day I'm sure there was a big, pretentious-looking painting on that wall...
Grossberg:
"Pretentious-looking"...?
Phoenix:
Well... you know the one I mean. Anyway, where did it go?
Grossberg:
Ah, yes, well... I... got rid of it. Got quite tired of the thing, really. I, er, sold it, you see. Yes, that's right.
Phoenix:
(Sold it!? I'm not sure I buy that...) Wasn't that painting rather important to you, sir? Did something happen?
Grossberg:
I don't see how it's any of your business! Please, speak no more of that accursed painting. I didn't... I... *mumble* *mumble*




Any option (after presenting Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B))

Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B) (if "Ease her fears" was selected upon presenting Bellboy's Affidavit in Detention Center - Visitor's Room)







Phoenix:
Excuse me, I was wondering about this photograph...
Grossberg:
...! Where did you get that!?
Phoenix:
I borrowed it.
Grossberg:
Well, give it back at once!
Phoenix:
Mr. Grossberg. Tell me about the man in this photo. He may have been in that hotel room with April May on the night of the murder. Do you know something about him... anything?
Grossberg:
...! Hmm. Ahem! Very well. I'll tell you what I know. However... You didn't hear it from me, if you follow.
Phoenix:
I follow.
Grossberg:
That man is Mr. Redd White. He's the President of Bluecorp.
Phoenix:
(Redd White... Hmm.) Bluecorp... they're something like a detective agency, right?
Grossberg:
They're information pros. They sell information, you see. Sensitive information. Despite his name, Mr. White has the blackest reputation of any man in this country. Should you run across him, watch what you say. You wouldn't want him digging up any dirt on you.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... selling information. Sounds like blackmail.) Can you tell me where Bluecorp is located?
Grossberg:
Hmm... I suppose.
Phoenix:
(Mr. Redd White, at last! Finally, a lead on this guy! Even if April May couldn't have done it, he could have! Time to take action!)
Returned photograph to Mr. Grossberg.
Grossberg:
Now, I must ask you to leave. I need to think about things. Alone.

Phoenix:
Excuse me, I was wondering about this photograph...
Grossberg:
Where did you get that!? Give it back at once!
Phoenix:
I'm sorry to have taken it without your knowledge. But... I have to know. Who is this man? He was most likely in April May's room the night of the murder.
Grossberg:
! What's that you say!? A-are you QUITE sure? My boy?
Phoenix:
(What has him so flustered I wonder...?)
Grossberg:
I... I beg your pardon, but I must ask you to leave. I need to be alone.
Phoenix:

Welcome! Please furnish me with the title of your personage!Phoenix:
(What the...?)White:
Your name! What's your name? I was just inquirably asking the title that you go by.Phoenix:
Uh... Wright. Phoenix Wright. ("Inquirably"...?)White:
Mr. Wright, is it? Right, I see... Splendiferous. Perhaps I have intimidated you with my giantesque vocabulary...?Phoenix:
(What is this guy's problem!)White:
I'm Redd White, CEO of Bluecorp. You know, Corporate Expansion Official? My business dealings bring me into contact with the elite of the elite. So I'm afraid I am not used to conversing with the wordily-challenged.Phoenix:
(What a fruitcake!)White:
Hmmm, let me guess... You are an attorney fresh out of law school, are you not? That's the only explanation for why you would come to meet me like this!Phoenix:
(What does he mean by that?)White:
No matter. So, what business does a "mighty" lawyer have with a man such as myself?Phoenix:
(Yipes! This guy's arrogance meter is off the scale!)Examine









Desk







Phoenix:
I'm guessing this is supposed to be a desk? My my... This is quite the... thing.
White:
It is modeled on my body, see? Well? Does its sleek roundature not... inspire you?




Painting







Phoenix:
...? Haven't I seen this somewhere...? Is this a replica?
White:
Ridiculosity! I have no interest in anything but originals. That right there is a bona fide original! Worth five million, for sure.
Phoenix:
Hmmm...




Statue







Phoenix:
A statue of a man holding up the world. The "Bluecorp" sign certainly stands out enough... The model for the man is, of course, Mr. White.
White:
Truly a work of art! But, probably to beautacious for you to appreciate, correct?
Phoenix:
(I think it's a little too "beautacious" for just about anyone to appreciate.)




Trophy display







Phoenix:
An impressive line-up of trophies. "Judges Special Runner-up" "Best Participation" "Judges Cooperation Award" "Special Good Try Prize" Hmm. The words "Judges" and "Special" kind of stand out.




Window







Phoenix:
This is the top floor of a 20-story building. The view is quite... presidential.Talk









Miss May







Phoenix:
Miss May is an employee of Bluecorp, is she not?
White:
Correct. She was my secretariat. What a shock it was to hear what she has done!
Phoenix:
"What she has done"... You mean the wiretap?
White:
Indeed! She is paid to answer phones. Tapping them is NOT in her job description. She does gather information for us as part of her duties. But, I assure you, we do not condone illegal methods! It is ineffable that she would do this.
Phoenix:
(It sounds like he's trying to turn Miss May into a scapegoat...)




Night of the murder







Phoenix:
On the night of the murder were you in April May's hotel room?
White:
Who can say? I seldom pay attention to mundane details such as time and place. My motto is: "Don't worry, be happy!"
Phoenix:
Still, Mr. White... The hotel bellboy has stated on the record that he does remember you very clearly.
White:
... No matter! The bellboy can say what he pleases. I still won't talk to you. If you want me to speak, put me on the witness stand! Although I doubt you'd be capable of doing that.
Phoenix:
(Hmm. He raises a good question, actually... Why didn't prosecution call him as a witness? He should have "seen" the same thing as April May!)
White:
Oh hoh hoh. The police... the courts... To me they are mere toys. Playthings for my amusement!




Bluecorp







Phoenix:
What kind of company is Bluecorp, anyway?
White:
Ah, excellent question! We buy and sell various kinds of information. We are a company of the future! You might say, we ARE the future!
Phoenix:
(Sell... information?)
White:
In just 10 years, I've built this business up into the grand office you see now. Ah, in case you were wondering, Bluecorp was named after the color "blue"! I, Redd White of Bluecorp, as founder and CEO, named it so! And why, you ask? Because I like the color blue of course! Fantabulistic, is it not?




That painting (appears after "Miss May" and "Night of the murder")







Phoenix:
Uh... there's something that's been bothering me.
White:
Yes? What might that be?
Phoenix:
That big painting on the wall over there...



It's gorgeous







Phoenix:
It's a very striking piece of art.
White:
Magnificentatious, isn't it!
Phoenix:
Yeah. ... (Why am I making small talk...?)

I've seen it before







Phoenix:
You know, I've actually seen that painting before.
White:
Oh?
Phoenix:
Just yesterday, actually.
White:

Phoenix:
My point is simple. Er, rather, my question is simple: Why is that painting hanging on your wall?
Leads to:
"..."




When did you get it?







Phoenix:
Say, when did you get that painting?
White:

I've seen that painting before. Yesterday, in fact. Why do I find that painting here today?

Wiretap







Phoenix:
About this wiretap...
White:
Ah, the one that Miss May used, right? Bad girl. Bad, bad girl.
Phoenix:
She testified that she placed the wiretap at your request.
White:
How pathetic. I guess she's trying to pass the buck. Bad, bad girl. Sorry I can't help you. I know nothing.
Phoenix:
(I'm going to need hard evidence to get anything out of this guy...)




Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B)







Phoenix:
About this picture...
White:
Gorgeous! That's a picture of me! Ah, I see it was taken in the prime of my youth. About 10 years ago, at a guess.
Phoenix:
The hotel bellboy says he saw this man on the night of the murder.
White:
... On closer inspection, he does look a lot like me, but I'm afraid this is someone else. Nope. That's definitely not me. He's far too young.




Anything else







White:
I am terribly sorry. But that really doesn't seem to concern me at all.White:
... Mr. Wrong, was it?Phoenix:
Wright.White:
It appears you do not fully grasp your position here. I ask again. Who are you?Phoenix:
Umm... huh? A lawyer?White:
No, my feeble friend. A "mere" lawyer. Worth nothing. Zilch. Zippo. Nada! Just like that sorry excuse for an attorney, Grodyburger!Phoenix:
(Wh-what!?) Ungh! Oof...! Unh... uhhh... (He... he punched me!)White:
Well, Mr. Lawyer. What will you do, eh? Charge me with assault? Charge away, I welcome it! For it is YOU who will be found guilty!Phoenix:
What...?White:
Heed my exposition! The police, the courts, they all do my bidding.Phoenix:
(So you say... But I wonder... Is that kind of control really possible?)White:
I don't expect you to understand. It is a world beyond your compensation. ... You came here from Grodyburger's, I presume?Phoenix:
Mr. Grossberg's... yes.White:
Then you must ask him: Why is it that this painting of his hangs here? Perhaps then he will tell you? Perhaps he will explain how a man can live life purely for personal profit! ... Go now! Skedaddle! There is nothing more to discuss!Examine









Desk







Phoenix:
I'm guessing this is supposed to be a desk? My my... This is quite the... thing.




Painting







Phoenix:
This painting was, until yesterday, hanging in Mr. Grossberg's office. Why does White have it now? It's not hard to imagine a few possibilities.




Statue







Phoenix:
A statue of a man holding up the world. The "Bluecorp" sign certainly stands out enough... The model for the man is, of course, Mr. White.




Trophy display







Phoenix:
An impressive line-up of trophies. "Judges Special Runner-up" "Best Participation" "Judges Cooperation Award" "Special Good Try Prize" Hmm. The words "Judges" and "Special" kind of stand out. He probably strong-armed them into giving him something.Talk

Today's trial







Phoenix:
So you came to see the trial?
Grossberg:
Yes, yes I did. Something was bothering me all last night, you see, couldn't get a wink of sleep.
Phoenix:
Really? What was that?
Grossberg:
Well, you see, it's just... Mia's sister, that poor girl. My boy, I owe you my thanks, truly. I don't know what I would have done if things had gone poorly for the girl.




Your refusal







Phoenix:
I asked before, but, why did you refuse her request for defense? I think I have a right to know.
Grossberg:
A right, Mr. Wright? No, no, I'm sorry. It's just, I need more time to think about it, my boy.
Phoenix:
... (He does seem troubled about something... I'm starting to have a feeling I know what it is.)




Mr. White







Phoenix:
So, I paid Bluecorp a visit.
Grossberg:
Oh? Oh, I see.
Phoenix:
Mr. Grossberg... I have to admit, something has been bothering me.
Grossberg:
Oh? What is it? Well, out with it, my boy!
Phoenix:
You see, it's just...



That big painting







Phoenix:
Mr. Grossberg, sir... There was a giant painting hanging right there the other day, was there not? The one you said you had "no intention of parting with"? Well, I saw it. Today. It was in the CEO's office at Bluecorp. Redd White's office.
Grossberg:
... So... you noticed. I suppose I should have guessed you would. It is a large painting...
Phoenix:
Mr. Grossberg, I know you and Mr. White are connected somehow!
Grossberg:
C-connected, you say?
Phoenix:
Yes! And I know what it is...



He's giving you information







Phoenix:
You're his client, aren't you? He's giving you information!
Grossberg:
What's that now?
Phoenix:
You've been protecting him all along. You protect him because you need his services!
Grossberg:
...
Phoenix:
You gave him that painting in exchange for some valuable information, didn't you?
Grossberg:
Utterly ridiculous. Me, his client? I would never willingly deal with that man. Never!
Phoenix:
(Huh? Did I get it wrong?)
Leads back to Talk options




He's blackmailing you







Phoenix:
Mr. White has something on you doesn't he? Blackmail?
Grossberg:
...!
Phoenix:
I think that painting is fairly gaudy proof.
Grossberg:
... Very well. This may be the chance I've been waiting for. Maybe it's time to get this off my chest, so I can finally rest easy again. After all, you were Mia's understudy. Perhaps it was fate?
Phoenix:
(What's he talking about...?)
Leads to:
"Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation."




You're lovers







Phoenix:
It's not something I can claim to understand... But you and Mr. White are lovers, aren't you!
Grossberg:
W-w-what! My boy!
Phoenix:
You sent that painting to him! As a sign! A sign of undying love!
Grossberg:
M-m-my boy, please! You're letting your fancies run away with you! Where do you get these bizarre ideas?
Phoenix:
I... I don't understand how you could...
Grossberg:
That's because I'm not, we're not... Don't be ridiculous! ... Enough. I'll swallow my pride and tell you all.
Phoenix:
(I knew it! They are lovers!)
Grossberg:
N-no! We are NOT lovers!
Leads to:
"Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation."





That photo of Mr. White







Phoenix:
That photo of Mr. White... Why would you have his photo, Mr. Grossberg?
Grossberg:
Umm... yes, well. It's been a long time since then...
Phoenix:
A long time ago? I'm sorry... but I think not. I think you still have ties to Mr. White even today.
Grossberg:
R-really! Whatever gave you that idea! W-what connection could I possibly have to an individual such as he?
Phoenix:
It's pretty straightforward, actually...



You go drinking together







Phoenix:
You go drinking together! You're friends, aren't you?
Grossberg:
... Now you're being foolish, my boy. Why in the world would I ever drink with the likes of him!?
Phoenix:
(Huh? Whoops... maybe that wasn't it.)

He's blackmailing you







Phoenix:
Mr. White has something on you doesn't he? Blackmail?
Grossberg:
...! I don't... I don't know what you're talking about!
Phoenix:
Mr. Grossberg, sir... There was a giant painting hanging right there the other day, was there not? The one you said you had "no intention of parting with"? Well, I saw it. Today. It was in the CEO's office at Bluecorp. Redd White's office.
Grossberg:
... So... you noticed. I suppose I should have guessed you would. It is a large painting...
Phoenix:
Mr. Grossberg... tell me what happened.
Leads to:
"Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation."




He's giving you information







Phoenix:
Redd White is supplying you with information, obviously!
Grossberg:
What's that now?
Phoenix:
You've been protecting him all along. You protect him because you need his services!
Grossberg:
... Now you're being foolish, my boy. What possible use could I have for the services of the likes of him!?
Phoenix:
(Huh? Whoops... maybe that wasn't it.)
Leads back to Talk options





Why wouldn't you defend Maya?







Phoenix:
I thought it was strange. Here was Maya, your own apprentice's little sister, in desperate need... Accused of killing her own sister no less, and you wouldn't take the case! I finally realized why. You and Redd White are connected. He's...



Your boss







Phoenix:
I'll bet you and White go way back! He's your boss now, and was before, I bet!
Grossberg:
My what? Boss? Are you serious?
Phoenix:
Yeah! You both have that sort of "we're in the same club together" feel to you.
Grossberg:
Please, stop. You have a very peculiar sense of humor, Mr. Wright. Very well, I'll talk.
Phoenix:
(What does he mean... "sense of humor"? I was serious!)
Leads to:
"Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation."




Blackmailing you







Phoenix:
Mr. White has something on you doesn't he? Blackmail?
Grossberg:
...! I don't... I don't know what you're talking about!
Phoenix:
Mr. Grossberg, sir... There was a giant painting hanging right there the other day, was there not? The one you said you had "no intention of parting with"? Well, I saw it. Today. It was in the CEO's office at Bluecorp. Redd White's office.

It's not something I can claim to understand... But you and Mr. White are lovers, aren't you!
Grossberg:
W-w-what! My boy!
Phoenix:
Mr. Grossberg. The other day, there was a giant painting hanging on that wall. I saw that painting again, today. It was in the CEO's office of Bluecorp. It was a present, wasn't it?
Grossberg:
Well, my boy, you have a splendid imagination!
Phoenix:
I... I don't understand how you could...
Grossberg:
That's because I'm not, we're not... Don't be ridiculous!
Phoenix:

Anything







Grossberg:
Sorry, my boy. I don't think I can help you with that.Grossberg:
Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation. Bluecorp is a company that excels in finding people's weaknesses, I'm afraid. I've been paying them for 15 years now...Phoenix:
(15 years...!)Grossberg:
All because of the "DL-6 Incident," as you may have guessed.Phoenix:
(The name on the back of those photographs!)Grossberg:
As you suspected, I could not stand in defense of Maya because of this. White would have destroyed me if I did.Phoenix:
(So that's the connection!)Grossberg:
It is hard for me to tell you this, my boy. But arresting Redd White will be nigh on impossible.Phoenix:
Impossible? Why!?Grossberg:
He has information on everyone. It gives him an iron grip! He owns judges, attorneys, prosecutors, police... and politicians.Phoenix:
What!?Grossberg:
They are bound, unable to do harm to themselves, and therefore, to him. Don't look at me like that. What you see is nothing more than the weight of many years.Talk









The DL-6 Incident







Phoenix:
What is the "DL-6 Incident"?
Grossberg:
"DL-6" is nothing more than the sorting code the police gave the case. It was 15 years ago now... I received a request from a medium. A spirit medium.
Phoenix:
(A medium...?)
Grossberg:
Her name was Misty Fey.
Phoenix:
(Fey!)
Grossberg:
Indeed. She was Mia's mother. She had been investigating a murder at the bequest of the police. And... she failed. As a result, the police called her a fraud.
Phoenix:
(This is what Maya was talking about the other day!)
Grossberg:
I did all I could for her, and in the end, cleared her of wrongdoing. That murder case, however remains unsolved to this day. That case, is the DL-6 Incident.




Reason for blackmail







Phoenix:
But why were you blackmailed over this, Mr. Grossberg?
Grossberg:
The DL-6 Incident was top-secret at the time. It made sense. The police didn't want people to know they were using a medium! They couldn't let people know. But one person found out. I... I told him.
Phoenix:
You told White?
Grossberg:
He offered me riches... It is an embarrassment to me now. Because I talked, the police were mocked far and wide. In secret, they began looking for the one who sold them out. Of course White heard about it, and he came to me. Only this time, the offer was blackmail.
Phoenix:
... I see.
Grossberg:
... White controls the law of this country as he sees fit. Yet if you would still challenge him... Have a close look at Mia's office.
Phoenix:
Mia's office...?
Grossberg:
She followed his every move for years. She may have recorded something of what she found.Fey & Co. Law Offices (after clearing "Reason for blackmail" Talk option in Grossberg Law Offices)Phoenix:
It's funny, looking at this room, it seems... so normal. Hard to imagine a murder took place here. Mr. Grossberg said there would be clues... Maybe I should have another look.Examine









Bookshelf







Phoenix:
All the cases the chief ever worked on are filed here. They're in alphabetical order. Let's take a look... Which file should I look at...?



File "A-I"







Phoenix:
Let's see if there's "A" record in this file that catches my "I." "A"... "B"... "F"! "Misty Fey." That's Mia and Maya's mother. Hmmm... Should I take a look?



Read it







Mia:
"'I have tarnished the Fey name.' Leaving only these words, my mother vanished. I was determined to find the ones who had made my mother blame herself in this way. Using the E.S.P. that runs in my family, I held an audience with the dead. Finally, the names of two men surfaced. One was Marvin Grossberg, a lawyer who sold my mother's information for riches. The other was the man who sold that information to the press. This parasite, who makes his fortune on threats and coercion... His name is..."
Phoenix:
Hmm. The record stops there. ... So Mia knew Grossberg...

Leave it be







Phoenix:
I don't think it has much to do with the current case. I'd be interested to know what it contains... but I'll leave it alone for now.

File "J-S"







Phoenix:
Let's see... "J" through "S"... Nothing much in here. Maybe I'll just skim some of this?



Skim







Phoenix:
*sigh* Well, no harm in flipping through a bit, I guess... The biggest part's here at the end in "S"... "Suicide"? Eww... She has a collection of suicide reports. There's politicians... policemen... ... ...! There's writing on most of these in pencil. "White"...? This is Mia's handwriting. Wait, I get it! Mia thought he was involved in these "suicides"! White drove them all to... ... I can use these newspaper clippings. Hmm... let's find the most disturbing one...

What's wrong? Is something stuck to my face? Why yes! There's my eyes, and my nose, and my mouth... But of course I jest. You need not restrain your mirth, my friend! It is okay to indulge in my cosmopolitan sense of humor. I will not think less of you.Present









Newspaper Clipping







Phoenix:
(This is the only clue that Mia left me... I'd better make this one count!) Mr. White... see this? It's an article describing the suicide of a politician.
White:
...
Phoenix:
He was embezzling secret government funds. Then, one day, word got leaked to the press. The very next day he took his own life.
White:
And this concerns me how...?
Phoenix:
I found this article in Mia's office.
White:
Miss Mia...?
Phoenix:
She had a file filled with articles like this. Every one of them was labeled with a single word... "White."
White:
...!
Phoenix:
Mr. White, I know what you did to this politician.



You bribed him







Phoenix:
You bribed him!
White:
B-bribed!? ... What exactly has led you to say this?
Phoenix:

White:
Hmph. You certainly have an active imagination.
Phoenix:
(Dammit!)

You spied on him







Phoenix:
You were spying on him, weren't you?
White:
"Spying"...?
Phoenix:
You snooped on him, and found out about the embezzlement. Then, when you revealed it, he was driven to suicide!
White:
Mr. Lawyer. I know nothing of this. And, even in the highly unlikely event that I did do such a thing... All I would have done is provide "information." That is not a crime in this country.
Phoenix:
(Gah! This guy's as cool as a cucumber...!)

You were blackmailing him!White:
Blackmail?Phoenix:
Not just him, either. You were threatening and coercing hundreds of others! You were involved in all of the suicide cases that Mia investigated! This company is built on blackmail! I'm right, aren't I?White:
What a bizarre accusation. Mr. Wrong... What is it that you should be doing now? Investigating me? No no no. I think not! You should be searching for the one who killed Miss Mia!Interphone:*beep*[Secretary's Office, hello?]White:

How dare you!White:
I'll point the finger at you, and you will be tried as Miss Mia's killer! The case is as good as settled. No lawyer of any worth will defend you. I have friends in the local lawyer's association, you see. You'll be given a lawyer so stupendously inept that they make even you look competent.Phoenix:

Well... I guess this is it!Phoenix:
Yeah. One way or another, this case gets decided today.Maya:
Aaa! Ph-Phoenix! Look!Phoenix:
(...! Prosecutor... Edgeworth.)Edgeworth:
I received a call from the public prosecutor's office yesterday.Phoenix:
?Edgeworth:
He told me that whatever Mr. White says today, it will be the "absolute truth." No matter how you try to attack his testimony... If I raise an objection, I have it on good faith that the judge will listen to me.Phoenix:
(What, does White have the judge in his pocket, too!?) So... you're saying I'm going to be guilty. End of story?Edgeworth:
... I will do anything to get my verdict, Mr. Wright. Anything.Maya:
Why... Why!? How can you torment an innocent person like this!?Edgeworth:
"Innocent"...? How can we know that? The guilty will always lie, to avoid being found out. There's no way to tell who is guilty and who is innocent! All that I can hope to do is get every defendant declared "guilty"! So I make that my policy.Phoenix:
Edgeworth... You've changed.Maya:
Hmm? Phoenix! You know him!?Edgeworth:
Don't expect any special treatment, Phoenix Wright.Maya:
Ph-Phoenix...?Phoenix:
Well... court will be starting soon. (Changed from [Well... court will be opening for session soon.] in the original release)Maya:
What? But wait! Your defense attorney isn't even here yet! They're not... (Changed from [Your defense attorney isn't even here yet! He's not...] in the original release)Phoenix:

Whaaaat!?Phoenix:
Okay, let's do this.September 9, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 1Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Phoenix Wright.Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:
Mr. Wright... Are you sure you're up to doing this?Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. I will be defending myself.Judge:
Understood. Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth:
As the details of the event are already quite clear to the court, today we will hear the testimony of a witness to the defendant's crime. (Changed from [today we will hear the testimony of another witness to the defendant's crime.] in the original release)Judge:
I see. The prosecution may call its witness.Phoenix:
(That went far too smoothly! Why didn't the judge ask Edgeworth why his witness didn't testify before!? It's like... it's like he already knows why! Hmm. If anyone's going to raise an objection about this, I suppose it's me...)Objection







Phoenix:
Mr. Edgeworth, you owe an explanation to the court! Why didn't this witness testify in the trial against Ms. Maya Fey!?
Edgeworth:
Hmph. I'm ever so sorry! Mr. White is a busy man, and besides... at the time, I thought that Ms. May's opinion was all that would be needed. Again, my sincerest apologies to the court.
Judge:
Excellent, Mr. Edgeworth. I appreciate your demeanor.
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
(Great. He gets to show off and I get nowhere.)
Leads to:
"I would like to call Mr. Redd White to the stand!"Let it go

(Forget it. I smell a trap.)
Leads to:
"I would like to call Mr. Redd White to the stand!"Edgeworth:
I would like to call Mr. Redd White to the stand!Edgeworth:
Please state your full name.White:
You wish to know the title of my personage?Edgeworth:
Er... your name?White:
Yes! That is what I said! Oh dear, do my locutions confuse?Edgeworth:
Name!Phoenix:
(These two are great together...)White:
My name is Redd White. But my friends call me Blanco Nino. I am the CEO, or to use a more common term, the President, of Bluecorp.Edgeworth:
Did you know the victim, Ms. Mia Fey?White:
That would be a negatory! No, I did not.Edgeworth:
... You were at the Gatewater Hotel the night of the murder?White:
Correct.Edgeworth:
And you witnessed the murder from there?White:
Ahem. Why tell you what you already know?Judge:
Very well, Mr. White. You may begin your testimony.Phoenix:
(If I can't rip this guy's testimony apart, I'm done for. Why do I always feel like it's the end of the world and I'm the last man standing?)White:
Ho hoh hoh. I hope you have made your peace with God, Mr. Lawyer!Phoenix:
...!Maya:
Let him have it, Phoenix!Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --White:
Let's see, it was about 9:00, I believe.
I was quietly perusifying... er, that's "reading" to you, some papers by the window.
Then I heard a bedlam coming from outside!
Surprised, I turned to look at the building across the way.
It was then I saw him: a spiky-haired man attacking a woman with long hair!
Needless to say that man was none other than you, Mr. Lawyer!
I called Miss May over at once. She, too, was flabbergasted of course.
The victim, she... she ran away, but you gave chase!
Finally there was a terrible impaction! Then it was all over...Judge:
Hmm... If things occurred as you testify, then I'm afraid the defendant is guilty. Very well, defendant... er, I mean, Mr. Wright. Your cross-examination...Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.Cross Examination-- Witness's Account --White:
Let's see, it was about 9:00, I believe.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
How do you know what time it was?
White:
Because I am always abso-posi-lutely perfect, you know?
Phoenix:
No no no, you're not getting away with that!
White:
You are so mistrusting, Mr. Lawyer! So... what was the proper term for "secretary" again...? Anyway, Miss May ordered room service for 9:00. It happened soon after the room service arrived.
Phoenix:
(Hmm. That's what Miss May said, too.)



Press further







Phoenix:
True, the bellboy who brought the coffee saw Miss May. But he testified that he did not see you at the time!
White:
Ahem. This is your concern? Silly Lawyer! Miss May received the coffee outside the room! Of course he could not see me. He would need X-ray vision to pull off something like that!
Phoenix:
(Hmm...)
Edgeworth:
Tell us, what were you doing at the time?
Leads back to cross-examination




Hold back







Phoenix:
(I don't see anything to gain by attacking him on this point any further.) Okay, what were you doing at the time?

Phoenix:
Just what is your eyesight?
White:
Counting both eyes... 40!
Phoenix:
40!? Don't add them together!
Judge:
I think the witness is trying to say his eyesight is good.
Phoenix:
(Hey, whose side is the judge on, anyway?)
Edgeworth:
And what did you do then?White:
I called Miss May over at once. She, too, was surprised of course.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What was Miss May doing at that time?
White:
She had just finished watching a soap opera on the TV, and was weeping openly.
Phoenix:
Did you know she had been tapping the Fey office phone?
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Irrelevant! That has nothing to do with the case at hand.
White:
I care not. I will answer the lawyer's bold inquiry. Miss May was acting alone when she tapped the phone of this Fey woman.
Phoenix:
You'd make a good politician, Mr. White.
White:
Ho hoh! After all, I am "El Presidente."
Judge:
Please continue.White:
The victim, she... she ran away, but you gave chase!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Can you be a little more detailed about that? I think it's worth knowing exactly what happened.
White:
Of course! Comprende! I understand! The victim was attacked, by you, and ran to the left. You gave chase, and struck her down!
Edgeworth:
Are you sure?
White:
As you know, I am always abso-posi-lutely perfect!
Judge:
Perhaps you could change your testimony to reflect this new detail.
Changes statement from "The victim, she... she ran away, but you gave chase!" to "The victim ran to the left, and you gave chase!"White:
The victim ran to the left, and you gave chase!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Are you sure about that?
White:
How many times must I say it? I am abso-posi-lutely perfect! End of story!
Phoenix:
(How many times must I hear that?)
Maya:
Psst! Phoenix! Doesn't something about that strike you as a little odd?Present May Testimony







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Wait right there!"White:
Finally there was a terrible impaction! Then it was all over...Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Um... "impaction"? Don't you mean just "impact"?
White:
Ridiculosity! I think you need to brush up on your language skills!
Phoenix:
(On second thought, perhaps I'd better leave the whole language thing alone...)Phoenix:
(Did Edgeworth "prep" this guy, too, I wonder? Anyway, I'd better find a weakness in there...)Phoenix:
Wait right there! Mr. White, you've dug your own grave!White:
What is this!?Phoenix:
You said the victim ran to the "left." But that directly contradicts Miss May's testimony! She clearly stated that the victim ran "right"!White:
...! Oh hoh hoh. It is simple. You have misheard her.Phoenix:
I think not. Look at the floor plans... The killer was here. And the victim, here. If the victim ran to the left, as you claim she did... She would have been running directly away from the door! She would have been running into a dead end! Don't you find that odd?White:
! Very strange... I did see her run to the left... I did.Maya:
Phoenix... look at his face. I don't think he's lying about this one.Phoenix:
True. (Maybe he really did see the victim run left...? So he did witness the killing...? Wait a second!)Judge:
Mr. Wright?Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor?Judge:
Miss May says "right," and Mr. White says "left." Can you explain this contradiction to the court?Mr. White is right







Phoenix:
As Mr. White testified, Mia ran to the left.
Judge:
But... But if that's the case... Why would she run in the opposite direction from the door?
Phoenix:
She did not. She was running towards the door, Your Honor.
Edgeworth:
Bwah! Now you're the one making a contradiction, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Not at all.
Leads to:
"Obviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!"Miss May is right







Phoenix:
As Miss May has stated, Mia ran to the right after she was attacked.
White:
What is this? I am not fashioning fabrications, I assure you! That lady ran to the left! I am sure of it!
Phoenix:
Then there can be only one explanation.
Edgeworth:
Eh...? And that is?
Leads to:
"Obviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!"Both are right







Phoenix:
Both witnesses are telling the truth. (For once...)
Edgeworth:
Hah! I doubt it! Er, rather, that does not clear up the contradiction!
Phoenix:
There is one scenario that would explain their conflicting accounts.
Edgeworth:
What!?
Leads to:
"Obviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!"Phoenix:
Obviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!Judge:
Mr. Wright! What do you mean?Edgeworth:
Yes, what do you mean, he was not "viewing the crime from the hotel"!? If he was not in the hotel, where could he have been!?Phoenix:
In the law offices of Fey & Co., of course! More specifically, he was standing here! (Time to show the court where Mr. White was standing!) (Changed from [Show the court where Mr. White was standing!] in the original release)Present killer's location







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"This is where he was!"Present victim's location







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
That's where he was!
Edgeworth:
M-Mr. Wright! We are not fools! How could he have been exactly where the victim was standing!?
Phoenix:
(Oh... oh, right!)
Judge:
Mr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!?
Phoenix:
Sorry, Your Honor! Sorry! Let me try that again...
Leads back to:
"Time to the court where Mr. White was standing!"Present anywhere else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
That's where he was!
Judge:
Hold it right there, Mr. Wright! If he was there during the very act of murder... That would make him an accomplice!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Impossible! There was no one other than the criminal and victim in the room! There is no evidence, no proof to the contrary! None!
Phoenix:
S-sorry! Er... let me try that again!
Leads back to:
"Time to show the court where Mr. White was standing!"Phoenix:
This is where he was! Look! When the victim ran for the door... If he was watching from this point, to him it would appear that she ran to the "left."Edgeworth:
Please! This is no time for jokes in ill taste! That is where the killer was standing!Judge:
Order! I will have order! Anyone disturbing the order of this courtroom will be held in contempt! Mr. Wright! What are you suggesting!?White:
R-r-rapscallion!!!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
The postulations of the defense are a distortion of the truth, Your Honor!Judge:
Indeed. They do seem a bit far-fetched...White:
... Ho hoh hoh! You provide us with so much entertainment, Mr. Lawyer!Phoenix:
(What now!? He's... laughing!?)White:
The hilarity of the moment made me remember something... It appears I have been unclear, and for this, I apologize. Mr. Your Honor... Might I be allowed to testify once more?Judge:
Very well, let's hear your revised testimony.Phoenix:
(Good luck. You can't fix a broken testimony, buddy!)Witness Testimony-- She Ran to the "Left" --White:
Miss May's testimony was correct... as was mine!
When you assaulted the girl, she first ran to the left.
And then you hit her, savagely! That is what I saw.
Next, with the last of her strength, she ran to the right.
You chased her, and delivered the final blow.
That is what Miss May saw.
You see? You hit her twice!
Don't you remember, Mr. Lawyer?Judge:
Hmm... That does seem to make sense. Will you be cross-examining the witness's testimony?Phoenix:
You bet I will! I mean, yes, Your Honor.Cross Examination

2025-01-22 14:43:25,377 - INFO - Assistant reply: To find a contradiction in the witness's testimony, let's analyze White's statements related to the final blow and the number of times the victim was struck:

1. White claims, "And then you hit her, savagely! That is what I saw."
2. He continues, "Next, with the last of her strength, she ran to the right."
3. White asserts, "You chased her, and delivered the final blow."
4. He concludes, "You see? You hit her twice!"

However, according to the autopsy report:
- Mia's Autopsy Report (Evidence 5) states: "Time of death: 9/5 at 9:00PM. Cause: single blunt force trauma. Death was instantaneous." It also later updates to: "Died from a blow by a blunt object. May have lived for a few minutes after being hit."

Based on the autopsy, the victim was only struck once with a single blow, contradicting White's claim of a second blow being delivered. This discrepancy reveals that White's testimony is unreliable.

Thus, we will present Mia's Autopsy Report to counter the statement where White claims, "You chased her, and delivered the final blow."

A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\" In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!August 3, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.

Character List:

Phoenix Wright (Defense Attorney): The protagonist, defending Larry Butz.
Mia Fey (27, Female): Chief Attorney at Fey & Co., Phoenix's boss and mentor.
Larry Butz (23, Male): The defendant, accused of murdering his girlfriend.
Cindy Stone (22, Female): The victim, a model who lived alone.
Winston Payne (52, Male): The prosecutor, known for lacking presence.
Frank Sahwit (44*, Male): Witness who claims to have seen Larry flee the crime scene.
Evidence List:

Attorney's Badge: Phoenix's proof of being a defense attorney.
Cindy's Autopsy Report: Time of death: July 31, 4 PM-5 PM. Cause of death: loss of blood due to blunt trauma.

Passport: Indicates Cindy returned from Paris on July 30, the day before the murder.
Blackout Record: Electricity was out from noon to 6 PM on the day of the crime in Cindy's building.
Testimonies:

Sahwit: "I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment."
Sahwit: "I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him."
Sahwit: "Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment."
Sahwit: "Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!"
Sahwit: "I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside."
Sahwit: "I thought to call the police immediately!"
Sahwit: "However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working."
Sahwit: "I went to a nearby park and found a public phone."
Sahwit: "I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM."
Sahwit: "The man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there."
Question:

During the cross-examination, identify the contradiction in the witness's testimony by presenting the appropriate evidence at the correct statement.
In this example, the witness claims to remember the time exactly as 1:00 PM, but the Cindy's Autopsy Report records the time of death between 4 PM-5 PM. This discrepancy can be presented as evidence to contradict the witness's statement.

Answer:
{
  "action": "present",
  "testimony": 9,
  "evidence": 2
}You may now present evidence that is helpful in finding a contradiction in the testimony. To present evidence, answer the question with a JSON object in the format of {"action": "present", "testimony": <number of the testimony>, "evidence": <number of the evidence>}, for example {"action": "present", "testimony": 5, "evidence": 2}.
Note that the evidence, character, and testimony is listed from 0 to n-1, so your response should be 0-indexed.
Explain your reasoning step by step before providing the JSON object. 
 Conclude your answer with "Final Answer:" followed by the JSON object on a new line.
Do not write any things after the JSON and make sure you use "Final Answer:" followed by the JSON object.
The following is the context of the case that you may find useful in helping you make a decision:

Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while.Mia:
Sorry, I've been so busy. How you been????:
Well, LONELY. And it's all YOUR fault. Nah, I'm just teasing. I've been great! I'm finally getting used to having my own place.Mia:
That's good to hear. Actually, I'm calling because I have a favor to ask.???:
I know, I know. You want me to hold evidence for you?Mia:
Sharp as always! There's a lot of buzz about the upcoming trial... I just don't feel safe keeping the evidence here.???:
I gotcha. So, what is it this time?Mia:
It's... a clock.???:
A clock?Mia:
Yeah, it's made to look like that statue, "The Thinker." And it tells you the time! I thought you might like it. You always liked toys.???:
Hey! I'm not a little girl anymore, Sis!Mia:
Now, now. You know I'm only teasing. Ah, I should probably tell you, the clock isn't talking right now.???:
Huh? It's not working? That's lame!Mia:
I had to take the clockwork out. Sorry. I put some papers inside it instead.???:
Papers? Is that the evidence, then? Hmm, well... there's a possibility that it might turn out that way, yes.Mia:
Can you come by the office tonight, say 9:00, to pick it up? I'll be in a pretrial meeting until then.???:
Okay, Sis, but I expect dinner! Something good! Like... burgers! I could really go for a good burger.Mia:
Okay, okay. We'll hit the usual joint.???:

Miss Fey, you are a poor liar. Why, I see it right over there... That must be "The Thinker" that swallowed those papers.Mia:
How could you know...????:
Ho hoh. You are not cogniferous of my background? Gathering information is my business, you see.Mia:

Anywhere







Phoenix:
I smell blood... and that can't be good! I have to check and see if Mia... the Chief's okay!Phoenix:
That smell... Blood!???:
... *sob* Sis...Phoenix:
(Someone's there!) ...! Chief? Chief...?Chief!!!Phoenix:
Who are you????:
...Phoenix:
(The strange girl dropped out cold. I left her lying on the office sofa. I went back to the chief where she lay under the window. Her body was still warm... I could feel it when I held her shoulder. Then, all too quickly, it began to fade... Until finally she was cold.)Phoenix:
Chief...Examine









Broken glass







Phoenix:
Some shards of glass are scattered on the floor. They seem to be the remains of a glass light stand.




Chair







Phoenix:
The chief's chair. A simple, functional design. Feels pretty good to sit in, too.




Mia Fey's body







Phoenix:
Chief... It's hard seeing her like this, but if there are any clues here... She was struck on the head with a blunt object. She probably died instantly. "The Thinker" lying next to her must have been the murder weapon.
The Thinker added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
Hmm... there are some glass shards near the chief's body. Must be pieces of the glass light stand lying broken in the back of the room.
Glass Shards added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
Nothing else that seems like a clue here... Hmm...? A piece of paper! It must have fallen from Mia's hand! What could it be?




Mia Fey's body (subsequent times)







Phoenix:
It's painful to look... but I have to, for Mia's sake. Looks like she was hit in the head with a blunt weapon. She probably died instantly.




"Maya" scrap of paper (after examining Mia Fey's body; before clearing all Talk options at Fey & Co. Law Offices)







Phoenix:
! A word is written in blood on this scrap of paper! "Maya"...? Did Mia write this? This piece of paper is a receipt from a department store, dated yesterday.
Receipt added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(I think that's enough snooping around for now. I'd better call the police... and find out what that girl was doing here.)

"The Thinker" statue







Phoenix:
It's encrusted with dried blood. How ironic that this became the murder weapon... again.




Window







Phoenix:
There's a large building right across from the office. The "Gatewater Hotel." A nice, luxurious place.




Bookshelf







Phoenix:
All the chief's important documents are packed in here. This is where she filed her case records and recent rulings.




Computer







Phoenix:
Surprisingly, the chief was never good with machines. About all she used this PC for was e-mail. She picked up this ancient model at some garage sale for practically nothing.




Desk







Phoenix:
A perfectly normal office desk. The chief had a very particular policy about office décor: "Spend big on stuff the clients use, but keep your own stuff simple."




Ledger book







Phoenix:
The Fey & Co. ledger book. Everything is written in the chief's ultra-neat handwriting. It's a small office, but it makes a good bit of money.




Corded phone







Phoenix:
Right! I'd better call the police! ...? That's funny... A few of the screws on the receiver are missing... It looks like someone was halfway through taking it apart.
???:
Police!? Please, come quick!
Phoenix:
(Wh-what was that!? Someone screaming from outside the window!?) ...! She's staring right at me! She's holding a phone in her hand...




Corded phone (subsequent times)







Phoenix:
The phone receiver is missing a few screws. I'd better not use it.Fey & Co. Law OfficesIf Fey & Co. Law Offices is being visited for the first time, before Receipt is added to the Court Record







Phoenix:

Phoenix:

Bookshelf







Phoenix:
You couldn't cram more legal books in here, even if you wanted to. Few can gaze upon the shelves without feeling insignificant.




Door







Phoenix:
The door to the chief's office. It's slightly open. I'd better not touch the door knob.




Painting







Phoenix:
A large painting. I guess you'd call this "modern art." I, on the other hand, call it a mistake.




Reception desk







Phoenix:
The reception desk. I usually sit here.




Sofa







Phoenix:
This sofa is for clients. It's leather... a real luxury model.




Writing desk







Phoenix:
A small writing desk cluttered with office supplies.Talk









What happened







Phoenix:
(She seems to be in shock. I don't want to disturb her, but I have to know...) Um... excuse me? Can you tell me what happened?
Maya:
... I came in... The room was dark. And Sis... Sis...!
Phoenix:
(So she was already dead.)




You and the Chief







Phoenix:
So, you're the chief's...?
Maya:
Sister. I'm her younger sister.
Phoenix:
And you were here... visiting? This late at night?
Maya:
Yes. She said she wanted me to keep some evidence for her.
Phoenix:
Evidence...?
Maya:
Yes... I-it was that clock... It was "The Thinker."Present









The Thinker







Phoenix:
Um, about "The Thinker"...
Maya:
! The Th-Thinker... That was... Oh, Sis! *sob*
Phoenix:
(Hmm, probably shouldn't have asked her about the murder weapon...)




Glass Shards







Phoenix:
This was lying next to the chief.
Maya:
I know. I saw it there too. I thought they might be pieces of the light stand.
Phoenix:
Hmm. Maybe. (Never heard of a glass light stand before...)




Receipt (before examining corded phone in Office)







Phoenix:
Before Mia died, she wrote a message with her own blood. She wrote it on the back of this receipt.
Maya:
! Th-th-that's MY name! W-why!? Why would she write my name?
Phoenix:
Please, just calm down.
Maya:
W-why would Sis write my name?
Phoenix:
(Uh-oh. Now I've done it... I'd better hurry up and call the police!)

Alright, I'm Detective Dick Gumshoe, see?Phoenix:
(Gumshoe...? What an odd name.)Gumshoe:
We received a report from the building across the way, see. Got a person saying they saw a murder.Phoenix:
(It must have been that woman I saw.)Gumshoe:
Anyway, I don't want either of you moving one inch, 'kay?Phoenix:
(Great. Just great. Maya... Wait, she wouldn't have... nah.)Gumshoe:
Whoaaaaaaaaaaaah! Scuze me!Maya:
Eek!Gumshoe:

K-killer...? I'm not--Gumshoe:
Case closed! You're coming down to the precinct, ma'am.Maya:
W-what?Phoenix:
Mia's younger sister, Maya, was arrested on the spot. I was taken in for questioning and didn't get out until the next morning. My eyes were heavy... but I couldn't sleep. I sat around, waiting for visiting hours to begin at the detention center. I had to talk to Maya as soon as possible.September 6, 9:07 AMDetention CenterVisitor's RoomPhoenix:
(Wow, they have poor Maya locked up like a criminal.)Maya:
Oh! It's you! The lawyer... G-good morning.Phoenix:
Good morning! (She looks so tired...)Maya:
Um... Are you going to be my attorney?Phoenix:
Well, that's what I wanted to talk to you about...It's up to you







Phoenix:
(I'd better give it to her straight...) It's up to you.
Maya:
Up... to me?
Phoenix:
Yes. I don't think this is something I should decide. After all, you're the one in trouble here.
Maya:
... They're never going to believe me... are they? Even you, when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it!
Leads to:
"Did I look at her like that?"Of course I will







Phoenix:
(First things first, I better get her cheered up...) Yeah, of course I will! Cheer up!
Maya:
R-really...?
Phoenix:
(Whoa! Did I say the wrong thing? She looks sadder now!) Um... what... what's wrong? You don't think I can do it?
Maya:
... No... no one could! Who would believe me? Even you, when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it!
Leads to:
"Did I look at her like that?"Sorry, not a chance







Phoenix:
(Maybe if I joke a bit she'll cheer up...) Hah hah! No way, Jose! Just kidding...
Maya:
... ... ...
Phoenix:
(Eh heh. Whoops. That didn't go so well.)
Maya:
...Heh...
Phoenix:
Huh? M-Maya...? Was that a... chuckle?
Maya:
What? N-no! ... It wasn't very believable, was it?
Phoenix:
(Not really...)
Maya:
I-I'm sorry! I just thought, since you'd made a joke... Please, don't mind me! You're doing just fine!
Phoenix:
(Who's trying to cheer up who here!?)
Maya:
... I knew it. No one will believe me.
Phoenix:
What?
Maya:
Even you-- when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it!
Leads to:
"Did I look at her like that?"Phoenix:
(Did I look at her like that?) No, no! I never thought...Maya:
I-it's okay. I understand. ... And... I've also heard about you.Phoenix:
Heard...? Heard what about me?Maya:
I... was talking to my sister on the phone the other day...Mia:
"Today was my junior partner's first time in court."Maya:
Wow! Really? How'd that go?Mia:
"It was quite the scene! Honestly, I was on edge the whole time. It's been a while..."Maya:
Hah! So, he crashed and burned?Mia:
"...He's a genius. One of those 'strike fear into the hearts of evil' types... The only thing he's lacking is... experience."Maya:
Huh, sounds like it was fun! Well, I know who to go to if I ever get into trouble now!Mia:
"I don't know, Maya. I think you might want to wait... give him three more years. That is, unless you want to be found guilty."Maya:
That's what she said!Phoenix:
...Maya:
I-I'm sorry! I didn't mean to trouble you...Phoenix:
No, it's okay. It's true, I guess. But... at the same time, I can't just sit and watch! When I think of the person who did this to Mia...Maya:
... I know...Examine









Security camera







Phoenix:
Smile for the camera...




Security guard







Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch. A real pro, this guy.Talk









Maya







Phoenix:
There's something I've been wanting to ask you...
Maya:
Yes?
Phoenix:
What's with that outfit?
Maya:
Oh, this? This is what all acolytes wear. It's my uniform, you could say.
Phoenix:
A-acolytes? Like people in religious training? What is it you do?
Maya:
Oh! It's nothing strange, really! I'm a spirit medium. ...In training.
Phoenix:
A s-spirit medium!? (I'm pretty sure that qualifies as strange.)




The day of the crime







Phoenix:
Could you tell me about the day of the murder?
Maya:
Yes! Let's see... that morning, I got a call from my sister. She wanted me to hold onto a piece of evidence for an upcoming trial.
Phoenix:
Evidence?
Maya:
Yes. That clock shaped like "The Thinker."
Phoenix:
(The one Larry made...) How could that have been evidence in a case?
Maya:
Um, right, she said something about that... ... I remember! Do you want to hear it in her own voice?
Phoenix:
H-her own voice!?
Maya:
Yes. I'm pretty sure our conversation is on my cell phone.
Phoenix:
You recorded it!
Maya:
Yeah! I forgot how to delete those things.




The day of the crime (after clearing "Your cell phone" Talk option)







Phoenix:
Could you tell me about the day of the murder? Sorry... I know it must be hard.
Maya:
No, it's okay. All I've been doing the last few hours is talking about it. I've kind of gotten used to it... Let's see... that morning, I got a call from my sister. She wanted me to hold onto a piece of evidence for an upcoming trial.
Phoenix:
(That's "The Thinker" clock that Larry made. It practically qualifies as a serial murderer by now.) So then, when did you arrive at the office?
Maya:
It was right around 9:00. The lights were off and... I could smell blood. Th-then I found her. My sister...
Phoenix:
Thanks, Maya. That's all I need to hear for now.




Your cell phone (appears after "The day of the crime")







Phoenix:
So, you say you have a conversation with your sister on your cell phone? Let's hear it!
Maya:
Right! Oh! I just remembered: that detective took my cell phone. Sorry.
Phoenix:
Oh, right. (Of course...) Next time I see Detective Gumshoe I'll ask him for it.
Maya:
I'll write you a note so you don't forget, okay?
Phoenix:
Sure, thanks.
Maya's Memo added to the Court Record.




Your cell phone (subsequent times)







Phoenix:
So, you say you have a conversation with your sister on your cell phone? Let's hear it!
Maya:
Right! Oh! I just remembered: that detective took my cell phone. Sorry.
Phoenix:
Oh, right. (Of course...) Next time I see Detective Gumshoe I'll ask him for it.
Maya:
I'll write you a note so you don't forget, okay?
Phoenix:
Sure, thanks.




Spirit mediums (appears after "Maya")







Phoenix:
So you're an acolyte. A, er, medium-in-training.
Maya:
That's right. The Fey family, especially the women, have always been very sensitive to the spirit world.
Phoenix:
Wait a second, you said the "Fey Family"? So, Mia was into this stuff too?
Maya:
Of course! She left the mountain to "follow her career," she said. Her powers were first-class, too!
Phoenix:
(I... I had no idea.) Hmm... Wait...!
Maya:
What?
Phoenix:
So, you're a real, honest-to-goodness spirit medium? With E.S.P. and all that?
Maya:
Yes. ...In training.
Phoenix:
Well, can't you contact Mia's spirit, then? We can just ask her who killed her!
Maya:
...! I-I'm sorry... I'm still in training. I couldn't do something on that level...
Phoenix:
(Hmm... I thought that would be too easy.)Present









The Thinker







Phoenix:
I wanted to ask you about the murder weapon...
Maya:
Poor Sis... *sniff*
Phoenix:
(Hmm. Better not ask her about this now.)




Glass Shards







Phoenix:
This was lying next to the chief's body...
Maya:
I saw that too. They said they thought these were pieces of a broken light stand.
Phoenix:
Yeah, that seems about right. (Though I'd never heard of a glass light stand before this...)




Receipt







Phoenix:
Remember that receipt?
Maya:
Y-you mean the one with my name on it?
Phoenix:
Any idea why she...
Maya:
Absolutely none! Um... Do you trust me?



I trust you







Phoenix:
I trust you.
Maya:
Why? Don't you think I did it, too?
Phoenix:
No, I don't. (It's just a hunch, but...)
Maya:
That detective thinks I did it.
Phoenix:
...
Leads back to Court Record




I don't trust you







Phoenix:
...
Maya:
I didn't think you'd believe me. You're just like the detective.
Phoenix:
I'm sorry... I don't like lying just to make people feel better. But it doesn't mean that I've decided you did it! (She seemed so lost at the crime scene.)
Leads back to Court Record





Maya's Memo







Phoenix:
I wanted to ask you about your cell phone...
Maya:
That detective took it when they brought me in.
Phoenix:
(So, Gumshoe took it... I'll have to try to get it back next time I see him...)




Anything else







Maya:
Sorry... I've never seen that before.After clearing all Talk options:Maya:
... Um...!Phoenix:
Huh? Something the matter?Maya:
Um... I was wondering, could I ask you a favor?Phoenix:
...?Maya:
This is the address of a famous lawyer. My sister gave me this a long time ago. She said if I was ever in trouble, I should call him. And, well, I'm in trouble. Do you think you could go ask him to represent me?Phoenix:
(Hmm...)Accept







Phoenix:
Sure, why not? I'll go ask.
Maya:
Thank you so much! I have no one else to turn to...
Phoenix:
...? Say, what about your parents...?
Maya:
... ... ...
Phoenix:
I... I see. Don't worry, leave it to me.
Maya:
Thank you! The trial's tomorrow... at 10:00.
Phoenix:
W-what!? Tomorrow!?
Maya:
Tomorrow.
Phoenix:
What if this guy refuses!?
Leads to:
"They told me that if I don't find one, the state will pick an attorney to defend me."Refuse







Phoenix:
I'm sorry... I think this is the kind of thing you should really do yourself.
Maya:
...You're right. ...
Phoenix:
Something wrong?
Maya:
Actually, I asked the police to contact him, and they tried calling a few times. Nobody could get a hold of him!
Phoenix:
They couldn't find him?
Maya:
I have no one left to ask!
Phoenix:
...? Say, what about your parents...?
Maya:
... ... ...
Phoenix:
O-okay! Don't worry, I'll go ask him for you.
Maya:
Y-you will? Thank you so much!
Phoenix:
I'm just worried what will happen if I can't find him.
Leads to:
"They told me that if I don't find one, the state will pick an attorney to defend me."Maya:
They told me that if I don't find one, the state will pick an attorney to defend me.Phoenix:
When will that happen?Maya:
They're giving me until 4:00 this afternoon.Phoenix:
(And visiting hours are almost up... I'd better hurry!) Right, I'll be back!September 6Fey & Co. Law OfficesPhoenix:

Hey! You there! This is a crime scene, pal! No trespassing! Umm... Sorry, don't I know you from somewhere? Wait, you're that Butz guy, aren't you!Phoenix:
No, no, Phoenix Wright. (How could anyone mistake me for Larry!?)???:
Ah, guess I got the wrong name, Mr. Wright. Sorry 'bout that. That Butz guy, he was a killer! And you're no killer! Right?Phoenix:
(He WAS proven innocent...) Umm... right. And you were...Detective Gumshoe







Phoenix:
Um... Gumshoe, wasn't it? Dick Gumshoe?

Right! At your service. Hang on! That's Detective Gumshoe to you, pal!

Phoenix:
Um... Suedeshoes, wasn't it?

That's me! Don't step on my blue suede shoes... Wait! That's a song, pal! My name's Dick Gumshoe... W-wait! That's Detective Gumshoe to you, pal!
Leads to:
"Anyway, get the name right. And don't go calling me "Dick"..."Detective Gumtree







Phoenix:
Um... Gumtree, was it? Detective Gumtree?
???:
G-Gumtree...? Gum doesn't grow on trees, pal! And I'm the one in charge here so don't push your luck!
Phoenix:
(Whatever you say, Detective...)
Leads to:
"Anyway, get the name right. And don't go calling me "Dick"..."Gumshoe:
Anyway, get the name right. And don't go calling me "Dick"...Police:
Hey, Dick! Get over here!Gumshoe:
Y-yes, sir! B-be right there! Umm... ahem! You're her lawyer, right, pal? If you got business here, you'd better do it quick!Phoenix:
(Whew! He thinks I'm Maya's lawyer...!)Examine









Bookshelf







Phoenix:
There's a horrendous amount of legal books here. Scarier still is that Mia probably read all of these.




Houseplant







Phoenix:
Mia's favorite potted plant. I remember it had this bizarre name no one could ever remember.
???:
"Cordyline stricta," pal!
Phoenix:
(Who was that!?)




Mia's desk







Phoenix:
Mia's desk. Perfectly clean, as always. The only thing it's missing is... Mia.




Movie poster







Phoenix:
An old movie poster. Apparently, this was the first movie that made Mia cry when she saw it. I'll have to check it out one of these days.




Window







Phoenix:
The sky is blue, and so am I... There's that hotel, right across the way.Talk









Mia







Phoenix:
About Ms. Fey... did you do an autopsy?
Gumshoe:
Hmm? You want to know the results, eh?
Phoenix:
...
Gumshoe:
Now don't you look at me like that, pal! It's no use! She might have been your boss, but that doesn't mean you get any special treatment. Alright, alright. You can see the report, but that's all!
Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.




Mia (subsequent times)







Phoenix:
So, Mia's death was instantaneous.
Gumshoe:
That's right, pal. She was... a beautiful person.
Phoenix:
You knew her, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Sure. All of us down at the precinct knew Ms. Fey. Much as it pains me to say this, she was a darn good lawyer. Hey, what are you looking at? I just got a little dust in my eye, that's all.




Maya







Phoenix:
Um, about Maya...
Gumshoe:
Yeah! I'm looking forward to the trial! Sorry, pal, but this is one trial you aren't going to win!
Phoenix:
W-why do you say that?
Gumshoe:
The city's put Prosecutor Edgeworth on the prosecution!
Phoenix:
(Edgeworth...)
Gumshoe:
I'm sure you know what that means, you being a lawyer and all.




Edgeworth (appears after "Maya")







Phoenix:
Prosecutor Edgeworth...
Gumshoe:
That's right, pal! Mr. Miles Edgeworth himself! Wait... you do know him, don't you!?



Of course I do!







Phoenix:
I know him. He's a feared prosecutor. He doesn't feel pain, he doesn't feel remorse. He won't stop until he gets his "guilty" verdict.
Gumshoe:
Aww, don't talk about him that way. You make him barely sound human! Still, I'm afraid this pretty much decides the case.
Phoenix:
(So, Edgeworth is on this one... He hasn't lost a case since he became prosecutor at the incredibly young age of 20. Of course, there are rumors of back-alley deals and forged evidence...)
Leads to:
"All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion."




Of course not!







Phoenix:
Never heard of him.
Gumshoe:
Whoa! And you call yourself a lawyer, pal!? About four years ago, this Edgeworth guy became a prosecutor at the age of 20! Everyone says he's a genius. Surprised you don't know him!
Phoenix:
(Of course I know him... I was just playing dumb. He's a cold, heartless machine who'll do anything to get a "guilty" verdict! There are rumors of back-alley deals and forged evidence...)
Leads to:
"All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion."


Phoenix:
(All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion. I never imagined I'd be facing him so soon...)Present









The Thinker







Phoenix:
I was wondering, do you know anything about this?
Gumshoe:
That statue? That's the murder weapon.
Phoenix:
(Huh? He thinks the clock is just a statue, too... I'm starting to wish I'd never seen this thing.)




Glass Shards







Phoenix:
There was broken glass at the crime scene, right?
Gumshoe:
Hmm? Oh, that? Seems like a glass stand next to the victim fell over. The glass shards were pieces of the broken stand.




Receipt







Phoenix:
There was a piece of paper next to the victim, wasn't there?
Gumshoe:
Yeah. The one with the killer's name written on it!
Phoenix:
Are you sure that Mia wrote it herself?
Gumshoe:
Given the condition of the writing, it's hard to say if it's her handwriting or not.
Phoenix:
(So there's no proof that Mia wrote it.)




Maya's Memo







Phoenix:
I was wondering... did you see Maya Fey's cell phone?
Gumshoe:
Oh that? I have that.
Phoenix:
Do you think you could give it back?
Gumshoe:
Sure! I mean, wait a second, pal! Tricky lawyer!
Phoenix:
(Uh-oh, he's on to me!)



Tell him straight







Phoenix:
(Hmm... if I tell him why I want it there's no way he'll give it to me!)
Gumshoe:
Something the matter?
Phoenix:
Oh, no, it's just... You know, Detective!
Gumshoe:
Nope. I know nothing, pal!
Phoenix:
That cell phone has a lot of numbers on it... like her boyfriend's... A cell phone holds all a little girl's sweetest and spiciest secrets!
Gumshoe:
Urk? Y-you're trying to confuse me! Sorry, pal. I already checked all the numbers in memory!
Phoenix:
Impressive! You're quite the detective.
Gumshoe:
Uh huh. Oh, here, you can have the phone back. There weren't any suspicious call records in there, after all.
Leads to:
"Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation..."




Tell him not-so-straight







Phoenix:
(Okay, I can't be straight with this guy... but what should I tell him?)
Gumshoe:
Something the matter?
Phoenix:
Oh, no, um... T-that carrying strap on the cell phone...
Gumshoe:
This? Hmm... it says "The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo"... "The Steel Samurai"... that action hero on TV?
Phoenix:
Yeah, you see that strap is a collector's item... She... was worried it might get lost if it went down to the precinct.
Gumshoe:
That what she said?
Phoenix:
Um. Yes.
Gumshoe:
... Okay, pal. I wrote down all the numbers she called anyway. Here you go.
Leads to:
"Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation..."


Phoenix:
(Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation...)
Maya's Cell Phone received from Detective Gumshoe. (Changed from [Received: Maya's Cell Phone.] in the original release) Check the Court Record to hear the recorded conversation.




Mia's Autopsy Report







Phoenix:
Thanks for this!
Gumshoe:
Don't mention it, pal. When it comes to dealing with lawyers, "fight fair and square," is our motto!
Phoenix:
(I don't know how I feel, seeing everything written up like this... It makes Mia's death seem so... routine.)

Phoenix:

Anything else







Gumshoe:
Hmm? What's that? Sorry, pal, but I got no info for the likes of you!After clearing "Mia" and "Maya" Talk options and presenting Maya's Memo:Phoenix:
(I guess I've asked all the questions I need to.)Gumshoe:
You all done, pal?Phoenix:
Um, yes, thank you. I'll be heading out now.Gumshoe:
Oh, wait. One more thing I wanted to mention to you. I don't suppose you're planning on talking to that witness. Anyway, you'd better not! No influencing the witness with your lawyerly ways, pal!Phoenix:
... (Come to think of it, I had completely forgotten about her...) The... witness?Gumshoe:
Yeah, Miss April May. I'm sorry 'bout this... But I can't tell you anything about her!Phoenix:
(Well, you just told me her name. Miss May, huh?) So you've sent her home already, then?Gumshoe:
Ahah! You're trying your lawyerly tricks on me now! She's not to go outside her room until the trial!Phoenix:
(So... she's still in the hotel across the way.) I guess I should know better than to try to get a detective to leak information.Gumshoe:
You got that right, pal!Phoenix:
(Time to pay a visit to Miss May!)September 6Grossberg Law OfficesPhoenix:
(According to the receptionist, the big boss is "out". She couldn't say when he'd be back. It must be hard to keep track of everything when you're a famous lawyer... Not to mention run an office like this. I guess I'll just have to come back later.)Examine









Bookshelf







Phoenix:
Expensive-looking mahogany bookshelves, filled with expensive-looking books. Hmm... funny... they don't look like they've ever been read.




Desk







Phoenix:
A solid mahogany desk. The wood's been polished to a deep luster.




Painting







Phoenix:
That painting has been bugging me ever since I stepped in here. The oil paint is so thick it's practically giving me a stuffed nose. I'm sure the price is nothing to sneeze at either, for that matter.




Potted plant







Phoenix:
An expensive potted plant. No idea what kind of plant it is, but it's probably the most expensive one available.




Table







Phoenix:
A table for clients. Hmm... an elegant ebony case, and if I'm not mistaken, that lighter's made of solid gold. Even I can tell someone here's got money to burn.Detention Center (after visitng Grossberg Law Offices, but before examining open drawer in Gatewater Hotel - Room 303)Maya:
Hey! What is it? Did you meet the lawyer?Phoenix:
Sorry. I haven't seen him yet.Maya:
I see...Phoenix:
(Hmm. I'd better go see if I can find this elite lawyer she's talking about.)Talk









Your family







Phoenix:
What about your family?
Maya:
I only had my sister. My father died when I was very young. And I don't know where my mother is.
Phoenix:
(Don't know...? So she could still be alive?)




Your mother (appears after "Your family")







Maya:
The women in my family have been mediums for generations. They say a lotta spiritual power runs in our blood. (Changed from [They say that E.S.P. runs in our blood.] in the original release) About fifteen years ago, our family was involved in an... incident. There was a man, and he... he... He ruined our mother's life.
Phoenix:
("Ruined"...?)
Maya:
After that, she disappeared. Several years after that, my sister announced she would "become a lawyer" and she left the mountain.
Phoenix:
... So, you live by yourself?
Maya:
Yes. I've gotten used to it. Oh, also... I had to become independent, or I would lose my powers! (Changed from [I had to become independent, or I would lose my E.S.P.!] in the original release)
Phoenix:
(I feel bad for her, all by herself up on that mountain...)




Your mother's enemy (appears after "Your mother")







Phoenix:
So, who was this man who, um, "ruined" your mother?
Maya:
About 15 years ago... there was an unusual murder case. It made quite a stir, everyone was talking about it, apparently. The police were running out of leads, and they were getting desperate...
Phoenix:
Wait... they didn't use a spirit medium, did they?
Maya:
The police convinced my mother to try to contact the victim.
Phoenix:
Wow... So, what happened?
Maya:
The case was solved... we thought.
Phoenix:
You "thought"...?
Maya:
The man my mother helped the police capture was innocent.
Phoenix:
...!
Maya:
The police's consultation with a medium had all been carried out in secret, of course. But... A man found out about it and leaked it to the press. He told all the papers that my mother was a fraud, and the media jumped on it big time. She... my mother... became the laughing stock of the nation.
Phoenix:
I see.
Maya:
... White...
Phoenix:
Excuse me? White?
Maya:
That was his name. My sister told me.
Phoenix:
White? Hmm...Present









Maya's Cell Phone







Phoenix:
Hey, I got your cell phone back.
Maya:
Oh! Say... Can I listen to my sister's voice?


Phoenix:
... (Maya's eyes closed... She listened to every word with such intensity... Before long, tears began to roll down her cheeks.) ...


Maya:
Thank you.September 6Gatewater Hotel - Room 303April:
Well! Hello there, handsome.Phoenix:
Umm... hi. (Smooth, Wright, real smooth.)April:

Bed







Phoenix:
A simple bed. It's been recently made. Nothing eye-catching here.




Flowers







Phoenix:
The flowers are fake, as expected. I know sunflowers and tulips, but that's about the extent of my floral knowledge.




Open drawer







Leads to:
"(There's a screwdriver stuck in this drawer.)"




Painting







Phoenix:
Ah. A still-scene painting. Wait, should that be "still life"? Whatever. One of those is hanging on the wall.




Table







Phoenix:
A bottle and two glasses are on the table. Somebody must be staying with her.




Window







Phoenix:
The late summer sunlight streams through the window. There's the Fey & Co. Law Offices building, of course. You can see the inside of the room pretty clearly from here. I think it would be a little difficult to recognize a face from this distance, though.Phoenix:
(There's a screwdriver stuck in this drawer. I wonder what's inside? Let's take a look...)April:
Hey! H-h-hey!!! What are you doing!? No touching! Oooh. Bad boy! Y-you really shouldn't pry around in other people's rooms, now. You wouldn't want to make me upset, would you?Phoenix:

What you witnessed







Phoenix:
Do you think you could tell me something? I need you to describe what you observed at the time of the incident.
April:
Ooh. "Observe," "incident"! You sound just like a lawyer in the movies! I like a man with a big... vocabulary.
Phoenix:
(Umm... *gulp* Better not encourage her.) Er... you know that thing that occur... um... happened the other day? The bad thing? What did you see when it happened? I don't suppose you could tell me about it? Pretty please?
April:
Let me see... Um, well... Dream on! If you want to know, you'll just have to come to the court tomorrow, Mr. Lawyer!
Phoenix:
(Oh boy.)




Miss May







Phoenix:
Um, could you... just who exactly are you?
April:
Oooh, Mr. Lawyer! Are you hitting on me?
Phoenix:
N-n-no! Hey! I'm just doing my job here!
April:
Tee hee! You know, you're cute when you blush.
Phoenix:
(Believe me, this is the first time in my life I've blushed this much...) Umm... eh heh. Right... can you just tell me what it is you do?
April:
Well... No! Tee hee! And you had your little hopes up, didn't you!
Phoenix:
(Oh boy.)




This room







Phoenix:
I see there are two glasses on the table. Is someone staying here with you?
April:
Oooh! What amazing powers of observation! You must be one of those famous detectives, like on television!
Phoenix:
Oh, no, not me, I'm, er, just a lawyer!

Say, Mr. Big Detective, why don't you go look for clues... in the garbage? Hmm? Miss May doesn't like nosey little lawyers... Hmph!

How can you just refuse like that! Please, tell me why you won't take the case!

Hmm? Eh, ahem! Well, you see it's just... I'm busy, you see!

But the client is Mia Fey's sister!
Grossberg:
Hmm... ahem.
Phoenix:
Mia trusted you... She knew her sister would be in good hands.
Grossberg:
Yes, yes, of course I know that. However! I'm sorry but, I must refuse. Sorry. Good-bye.
Phoenix:
Creep. Fine. I don't have time to argue with you anyway. I'll go look elsewhere.
Grossberg:

Phoenix:
Huh? Did you say something?
Grossberg:
I think not, I said.
Phoenix:
Wh-what do you mean?
Grossberg:
I'm terribly, terribly sorry. But I'm afraid that no lawyer worth their salt will take on this particular case. Terribly sorry, m'boy.
Phoenix:
Why!?
Grossberg:
I... I cannot say. ... I beg your pardon, but could you leave? Now? I've nothing more to discuss with you.
Phoenix:
(What's going on here!?)




Mia







Phoenix:
How did you know Mia Fey...?
Grossberg:
... She... worked here. A long time ago. Quite the apprentice, that one. Learned my techniques in the blink of an eye! She left one day, quite suddenly... She had a mission, you see.
Phoenix:
A "mission"?
Grossberg:
You could see it in her eyes. She followed it with a burning passion. Never looked back, that one.




That painting







Phoenix:
That's... quite a painting.
Grossberg:
Ahah! You noticed! It's my pride and joy! Impressive, isn't it? Well? ISN'T IT? The color of the sky! The hue of the sea! The weave of the straw hat! It's worth at least three million. I have no intention of parting with it, of course. No, I won't sell it! Not even to you!

That witness's strange behavior... was that all an act? And the way that lawyer refused to help out Maya... But more than all that, she has no one left to help her!

Might I ask you to inform Miss May that there is a message for her? Please tell her that Mr. White, of Bluecorp phoned.Phoenix:
Oh, right. Sure. (Mr. White... of Bluecorp? Where have I heard that name?)Maya:
White... That was his name. My sister told me.Phoenix:

There's a screwdriver sticking out of that half-open drawer. Now's my chance to see what's inside! ...! What do we have here! A... wiretap? Hmm! What would a woman like her be doing with a thing like this?Wiretap added to the Court Record.Phoenix:
There is definitely something suspicious about this "Miss May"! Why would she have something like this in her hotel room? There's a story behind all this, I know it! Alright... I'll be using this bit of evidence in tomorrow's trial, that's for sure. For Maya's sake... I'll get to this woman's bottom! Wait... I mean ... you know what I mean.April:

Part 4September 7, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 1Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Ms. Maya Fey.Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor. (Miles Edgeworth... I'd better not show any signs of weakness today, or he'll be on me in an instant.)Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth. Please give the court your opening statement.Edgeworth:
Thank you, Your Honor. The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, was at the scene of the crime. The prosecution has evidence she committed this murder... and we have a witness who saw her do it. The prosecution sees no reason to doubt the facts of this case, Your Honor.Judge:
I see. Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Let's begin then.Edgeworth:
If we may call our first witness, Your Honor. (Changed from [You may call your first witness.] in the original release) The prosecution calls the chief officer at the scene, Detective Gumshoe!Edgeworth:
Witness, please state your name and profession to the court.Gumshoe:
Sir! My name's Dick Gumshoe, sir! I'm the detective in charge of homicides down at the precinct, sir!Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe. Please, describe for us the details of this murder.Gumshoe:
Very well, sir! Let me use this floor map of the office to explain. The body was found by this window, here.Edgeworth:
And the cause of death?Gumshoe:
Loss of blood due to being struck by a blunt object, sir! The murder weapon was a statue of "The Thinker" found next to the body, sir! It was heavy enough to be a deadly weapon, even in a girl's hands, sir!Judge:
The court accepts the statue as evidence.Phoenix:
(They're still calling it a "statue"...)Floor Plans added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:
Now, Detective...Gumshoe:
Y-yes sir!Edgeworth:
You immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey, who was found at the scene, correct? Can you tell me why?Gumshoe:
Yes sir! I had hard evidence she did it, sir!Judge:
Hmm. Detective Gumshoe. Please testify to the court about this "hard evidence."Witness Testimony-- Maya Fey's Arrest --Gumshoe:
As soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!
There were two people there already:
The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.
I immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey!
Why? We had a witness account describing her!
The witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder!Judge:
Hmm... The very moment, you say. Very well. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor. (Cross-examine what...? I couldn't see a single contradiction in that testimony...)...whoosh...SMACK!Phoenix:
(Hey! Maya just threw something at me... What's this? "When my sister couldn't find any contradictions in a witness's testimony she would bluff it and press the witness on every detail! The witness always slips up and says something wrong... It worked lots of times!" Heh... I should have expected Maya would know some of her sister's tricks! Alright. Let's give this a try!)Judge:
Something the matter?Phoenix:
No, Your Honor. I'd like to begin my cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Maya Fey's Arrest --Gumshoe:
As soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Who did you say you got a call from?
Gumshoe:
Hey pal, don't play dumb! You know who! The call was from a customer at the Gatewater Hotel, right across from the crime scene!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... okay, I pressed. Not sure it did much, though.) Right. Please continue.Gumshoe:
There were two people there already:Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe, how long would you say it took, between you receiving the call, and your arrival at the scene of the crime?
Gumshoe:
Hmm, right... I'd say it was about 3 minutes!
Phoenix:
Th-that's pretty fast!
Gumshoe:
Our motto this month is "quick response"! That's how I got there before the killer got away!
Edgeworth:
Indeed! So, tell us who the two people you found on the scene were.
Gumshoe:
Yes sir!Gumshoe:
The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Are you absolutely sure it was us?
Gumshoe:
Listen pal, your dumb act will only get you so far! With her funky hippie clothes and your spiky hair? You two stand out like... like suspicious people at a crime scene!
Phoenix:
(Well... he does have a point about her. She is pretty unmistakable. I should pick my points to press with a little more care...)Gumshoe:
I immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Why's that? What's your reason?Gumshoe:
Why? We had a witness account describing her!Press

Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Hold on just one second!"Phoenix:
(I can't see a single contradiction in there! I'll just have to take Maya's advice and press him on anything suspicious!)Phoenix:
Hold on just one second!Gumshoe:
Y-yeah?Phoenix:
If I heard correctly... You said you arrested her because you had "hard evidence" she did it, correct?Gumshoe:
Huh? Did... did I say that? Me?Phoenix:
I heard you say it!Judge:
You did say it.Edgeworth:
You said it.Phoenix:
Exactly what about this suspicious woman in pink's claim was "hard evidence"!?Gumshoe:
Wh-what!? Miss May isn't suspicious, and she sure isn't pink, pal! W-well, I guess she is pink...Judge:
That's enough, Detective Gumshoe. Do you have any more solid proof other than her claims, Detective?Gumshoe:
Umm...Phoenix:
(Hmm! I guess pressing can have its advantages!)Gumshoe:
... Yes.Phoenix:
(Gah!)Gumshoe:
Sorry, I got the order of things mixed up in my testimony, Your Honor Sir! There was something I should have told you about first, Your Honor!Judge:
Very well, Detective. Let's hear your testimony again.Witness Testimony-- Hard Evidence --Gumshoe:
After securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.
I found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!
On it, the word "Maya" was written clearly in blood!
Lab test results showed that the blood was the victim's!
Also, there was blood found on the victim's finger!
Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!
How you like that? That's my "hard evidence"!Judge:
Hmm... Before we begin cross-examination, I have a question for you, Detective.Gumshoe:
Y-Your Honor?Judge:
Why didn't you testify about this vital piece of evidence the first time!?Gumshoe:
Ah... eh... I know. I'm real embarrassed I forgot about it, Your Honor Sir.Judge:
Try to be more careful! Very well, the defense may begin its cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Hard Evidence --Gumshoe:
After securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
And did you find any evidence?
Gumshoe:
Now, now, don't jump the gun on me, pal. Just listen. I'm getting to the good part!
Phoenix:
(I got a bad feeling about this...)Gumshoe:
I found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Just because you found it next to the body doesn't mean the victim wrote it!
Gumshoe:
Ho hoh! Then who did write it, smarty-pants?
Phoenix:
Wh-who? Um...



The killer







Phoenix:
Th-the killer! Anyone can see that!
Gumshoe:
Hoh. You're saying the killer wrote her OWN name!? Buddy, please!
Phoenix:
She was framed!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Hold on. If that's the case, where's your evidence?
Phoenix:
Ah... (Urk!)
Edgeworth:
Hah! I guess that was a bit of a tall order for you. Those without evidence shouldn't open their mouths, Mr. Wright.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, pal!
Phoenix:
(Argh...!)
Leads to:
"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found."




Miss May







Phoenix:
Well... it could have been the witness, Miss May!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Hold on. The witness was in her hotel room, not the office. Try pulling the other leg, Mr. Wright!
Gumshoe:
Yeah, and while you're at it, pull mine too, pal!
Phoenix:
(Argh...!)
Leads to:
"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found."




I did







Phoenix:
It... it could have been me!
Gumshoe:
What! S-so it was you!
Phoenix:
No, no, no, I'm just saying it COULD have been me! Can you prove it wasn't?
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Hold on. So, you admit to this? You admit that you wrote the note?
Phoenix:
Uh...
Edgeworth:
Listen to me, Mr. Wright. This is a court of law, and I expect you to refrain from making thoughtless statements! Amateur!
Phoenix:
(...!)
Leads to:
"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found."


Edgeworth:
Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found.Present Mia's Autopsy Report







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Detective Gumshoe!"Gumshoe:
On it, the word "Maya" was written clearly in blood!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Do you have proof it was Mia who wrote that!?
Gumshoe:
Of course I do, pal!
Phoenix:

Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Detective Gumshoe!"Gumshoe:
Lab test results showed that the blood was the victim's!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What kind of "tests" were these again?
Gumshoe:
Huh? What kind? Umm... well... I hear they take the, um, little bits in the blood, the... er... hemo... hemogl... Hermo... goblins... hobgob... Er...? Herma-goblin bobbin... I-I refuse to testify on this matter, sir! I'm no expert on blood tests!
Judge:
Yes, that was quite clear. You may continue with your testimony.
Gumshoe:
Th-thanks, pal. I mean Your Honor Sir.
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe.
Gumshoe:
Y-yeah?
Edgeworth:
I think you can expect a pleasant bonus in your next pay check.
Gumshoe:
Oh? Oh hoh hoh.

Right! Where was I?Present Mia's Autopsy Report

On which hand was the bloody finger, Detective?
Gumshoe:
The right hand!

Hah hah hah! Nice try!

Phoenix:

Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe! Do you get a lot of cases where the victim actually writes the killer's name?
Gumshoe:
Sure! It happens all the time in books and the movies!
Phoenix:
This isn't a movie, Detective.
Gumshoe:
Oof!
Phoenix:
Let's talk about reality, shall we?
Gumshoe:
Umm... I guess, I haven't heard of many cases... no.
Phoenix:
Don't you find it a little odd that the victim would write down a name? Especially the name of her own sister?
Gumshoe:
Ah, yeah, actually, you got a point, pal.
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Stop right there. The witness's opinion on the matter is irrelevant! The facts are clear: the victim wrote down the name of the accused... The victim told us the name of her killer!
Judge:
Order! Order!
Phoenix:
(That didn't go so well...)
Gumshoe:
Th-that's right! What he said!Present Mia's Autopsy Report







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Detective Gumshoe!"Phoenix:
(That's his whole testimony... Okay, there has to be a contradiction in there somewhere. Let's find it!)Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe! There's one thing I want you to clarify for me here. You say that the victim, Mia Fey, wrote this note. That she was accusing the defendant, Maya Fey? That's really what you're saying?Gumshoe:
Wh-what? This isn't one of those lawyer tricks, now, is it? Of course she wrote it! Who else could have!?Phoenix:
You have it backwards, Detective.Gumshoe:
B-backwards?Phoenix:
The victim is the only person who absolutely could NOT have written it! This is a report from your department, Detective. "Immediate death due to a blow from a blunt object." She died immediately!Gumshoe:
But...!Phoenix:
No "but"-ing your way out of this one, Detective!Judge:
Order! Order! The defense has a point. Someone who died immediately wouldn't have the time to write anything down.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright. I beg your pardon, but when exactly did you obtain that autopsy report?Phoenix:
Wh-when...!?The day of the murder







Phoenix:
I... I'm pretty sure it was the day of the murder.
Gumshoe:
You're wrong there, pal! We didn't write an autopsy report 'til the day after!
Phoenix:
Oh. Right.
Leads to:
"The prosecution's point being...?"The day after the murder







Phoenix:
It was the day after the murder...
Leads to:
"The prosecution's point being...?"I forget







Phoenix:
I'm... sorry, I forgot.
Edgeworth:
Hah! Forgot, you say?
Gumshoe:
It was the day after the murder, Your Honor Sir. I was the one who handed it to him myself! Personally!
Phoenix:
Oh. R-right.
Leads to:
"The prosecution's point being...?"Judge:
The prosecution's point being...?Edgeworth:
That autopsy report is outdated, Your Honor.Phoenix:
Wh-what!?Edgeworth:
A second autopsy was performed yesterday, at my request! "Death was almost immediate due to a blow from a blunt object... But there is a possibility the victim lived for several minutes after the blow." I received these results this morning.Phoenix:
N-no way!Edgeworth:
Your Honor! It's quite easy to imagine that the victim did have time to write "Maya"! That is all.Judge:
I see!Phoenix:
(Damn you, Edgeworth! I should have known you'd have something up your sleeve!)Edgeworth:
Why, Mr. Wright, you look shocked! Something you want to say?You're a sham, Edgeworth!







Phoenix:
Mr. Edgeworth... I've heard there's nothing you won't do to get your verdict... What reason could you possibly have had to request a second autopsy report?
Judge:
Mr. Wright! The defense will refrain from personal attacks on the prosecution!
Edgeworth:
No matter, Your Honor... Mr. Wright. Say what you will, the evidence in this report is undeniable.
Leads to:
"Your Honor, I submit this report to the court."The detective's a sham!







Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe! You're a sham! How could you give me a faulty report!?
Gumshoe:
Huh? I-I thought...
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe.
Gumshoe:
Urp!
Edgeworth:
I'm disappointed in you, handing him the wrong report like that.
Gumshoe:
Eh...? I... I'm sorry, sir.
Edgeworth:
You are at fault, Detective. This isn't going to look good on your evaluation next month.
Gumshoe:
W-what? B-but... *sigh*
Leads to:
"Your Honor, I submit this report to the court."I'm a sham!







Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe. Are you calling me a fool because I believed your report?
Gumshoe:
Huh? Me? I-I'm not... huh?
Edgeworth:

Gumshoe:
Urp!

Your Honor, I submit this report to the court.Judge:
U-understood. The court accepts the evidence.Autopsy Report updated in the Court Record.Edgeworth:
Well, Your Honor? The evidence strongly suggests the victim was identifying the killer.Judge:
I suppose that's the obvious conclusion, yes.Phoenix:
(Darn! This isn't good!)Edgeworth:
The prosecution would like to call its next witness. This poor, innocent girl saw the murder with her own eyes!Judge:
Let the witness Miss April May take the stand.Phoenix:
(Exactly what part of her is "innocent"...?)Edgeworth:
Witness, your name, please.April:
April May! At your service! *wink*Judge:
Order! An introduction should not require any reaction from the crowd! The witness will refrain from wanton winking! ([wanton] misspelled as [wonton] in the original release)April:
Aww... Yes, Your Honor.Phoenix:
(This is not good... She's already captured the heart of every man in the court!)Edgeworth:
Tell us, where were you on the night of September 5, when the murder occurred?April:
Um... gee... I was, like, in my hotel room? Tee hee. I checked in right after lunch.Edgeworth:
And this hotel is directly across from the Fey & Co. Law Offices?April:
Mmm... that's right, big boy.Judge:
Please testify to the court about what you saw.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --April:
It was, like, 9:00 at night. I looked out the window, y'know!
And then, oooh! I saw a woman with long hair being attacked!
The one attacking her was the mousey girl sitting in the defendant's chair!
Then the woman, like, dodged to one side and ran away!
But that girl, she caught up to her and... and... She hit her!
Then the woman with long hair...
She kinda... slumped.
The end. That's all I saw. Every little bitsy witsy! *wink*Judge:
Hmm...Edgeworth:
Well, Your Honor?Judge:
I see. It is a remarkably solid testimony. I don't see a need to trouble the witness any...Phoenix:
W-wait, Your Honor!Judge:
Yes, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:
What about my cross-examination!?Judge:
I thought the witness's testimony just now was quite... firm. Didn't you?Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright... I understand you were Ms. Mia Fey's understudy, were you not? You must know her techniques well. Her cowardly way of finding tiny faults in perfectly good testimonies...Phoenix:
H-hey! How dare you!Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? Will you cross-examine the witness?Yes, I'm doing it







Phoenix:
I'll gladly proceed with the cross-examination. (If only because I have a feeling Edgeworth doesn't want me to! She has to have some weakness!)
Leads to:
"Very well, you may begin your cross-examination!"No thanks







Phoenix:
No... you're right. I guess there wouldn't be much point.
Edgeworth:
Heh heh heh. I'm glad you saw the error of your ways so soon! Your Honor. The prosecution rests its case!
Phoenix:
(Wh-what? That's it!?)
Judge:
Very well.
Phoenix:
W-wait! Hold on!
Judge:
Yes, Mr. Wright? Changed your mind? Will you cross-examine the witness?
Phoenix:
Yes yes yes! (I'd better, or I'll lose on the spot!)

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Why did you do that?
April:
Huh? "Why"? Like, why what?
Phoenix:
Why did you look out the window? Were you expecting to see something?
April:
Oh, well, um... gee!
Phoenix:
(What? That's it? She can't get out of this question that easily!)
April:
I sort of, y'know. I had a feeling!
Phoenix:
(Well, I have a feeling she's trying to avoid the question! Maybe I should press a little harder on this one?)



Go for it







Phoenix:
(Let's see how far I can run with this...) Surely, you must have had a reason to look out your window at that time of night!
April:
I... oooh!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright! I will not have you badgering my witness!
Phoenix:
B-badgering?
Edgeworth:
You insist on needling her with these trivial questions. I really don't think it should be allowed.
(Yeah! Yeah! Stop him!)

Judge:
Order! Mr. Wright, you have been warned.
Phoenix:
(Poor girl!? What about poor me!?)

The one attacking her was the mousey girl sitting in the defendant's chair!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
How do you know she was the defendant?
April:
Huh? Well... y'know! S-she had a girlish physique. Women know these things. Look... I-I just know, okay?
Edgeworth:
There was only one person at the scene of the crime with a short, girlish figure. The testimony is bulletproof, Your Honor.
Phoenix:
(He's right...)



Yep, he's right







Phoenix:
(Her testimony certainly does make sense... And everyone in the court keeps siding with her. I'd better not press too hard on this one.)
Edgeworth:
So then, tell us what happened to the victim.

Yes, what is the meaning! Somebody tell me because I'm clueless! About this, I mean!Phoenix:
Okay... If you had really witnessed my client, Maya Fey... You would have noticed her clothes before noticing her physique!April:
...!Phoenix:
No one wears clothes like this on a daily basis! Except her! And I'm no expert on fashion, but her hairdo looks far from normal to me! However, the witness's testimony mentions neither of these things! The testimony is bogus!April:
But... but!Judge:
Still, we don't know if she was dressed that way the night of the murder...Phoenix:
She was, Your Honor! I saw her. And so did Detective Gumshoe! What do you say to that, Miss May?April:
Rowr! What are you trying to say, you mean lawyer! I-I saw what I saw. I... just didn't think all the trifling little details were necessary, darling.Judge:

Miss May. What you said just now was quite... revealing.April:
Revealing? Oooh, you'd like that, wouldn't you. Naughty Mr. Lawyer...Phoenix:
You just said that this statue of "The Thinker" was a clock. But there's no way of knowing that just by looking at it!April:
Urp!Phoenix:
Another person in much the same position as you recently called this a "clock," too... And he was found guilty... of murder!Judge:
Order! Order!Phoenix:
Miss May. Can you explain how you know this was a clock?April:
Oooh... urp!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
The witness saw the murder with her own eyes! That's all that's important here! The defense is trying to confuse the issue with trivial concerns!Judge:
Yes... yes, of course. You will withdraw your question, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:Phoenix:
But questions are all I have, Your Honor! And as you may recall, I've caught murderers with these questions before! (Well, only once...)Judge:
... ... Objection sustained. You may continue to question the witness.Phoenix:
(Whew, that was close. If he stopped me there, the trial would be over!)April:
Huh? What? So... what happens now?Phoenix:
What happens now is you answer my question! How did you know it was a clock?April:
What...! Th-that's... ...Because... I heard it? Yes! I heard it say the time!Phoenix:
So, you've been to the law offices of Fey & Co.!April:
N-n-no! Hey, I didn't say that! Why would I go there! I heard from my hotel room. Hee hee!Edgeworth:
The law offices of Fey & Co., where the murder took place, are very close to the hotel. She could easily have heard the clock!Judge:
Hmm. Well, Mr. Wright? Are you satisfied?Phoenix:
No, Your Honor! (I can't give up now!) I'm not satisfied because...She couldn't have heard it







Phoenix:
You were at the hotel! There's no way you could have heard a clock go off in the building next door!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
You have proof that she could not?
Phoenix:
Uh...
Edgeworth:
Amateurs, amateurs. Listen to me, Mr. Wright. In the courtroom, proof is everything. Without it, you have nothing. You ARE nothing.
Phoenix:
Then I would like to propose a test to see if she really could have heard...
Edgeworth:
The prosecution denies your request!
Phoenix:
Wh-what!? On what grounds?
Edgeworth:
This is a trivial matter with no direct bearing on the case at hand!
Judge:
Indeed. Objection sustained.
Phoenix:
(Damn! Time to switch directions... quick!)
Judge:
Ready to proceed, Mr. Wright?
Leads back to:
"No, Your Honor!"It couldn't have rung







Leads to:
"Your Honor, members of the court..."Phoenix:
Your Honor, members of the court... It is inconceivable that the clock in question rang!It's empty







Phoenix:
That clock is missing its clockwork!
Judge:
H-how could you possibly...?
Phoenix:
Just have a look... Right now! (Changed from [Just have a look... As soon as you can!] in the original release)
Judge:
... Oh!
Phoenix:
See anything interesting, Your Honor?
Judge:
It is as the defense says!
Leads to:
"This clock is missing its clockwork!"It's broken







Phoenix:
I-I think it's broken! That clock's busted!
Judge:
You "think"?
Phoenix:
J-just look at it! Your Honor, please examine the clock!
Judge:
Hmm... Oh!
Phoenix:
See anything interesting, Your Honor?
Judge:
Well, I'm not sure I would call this "broken," but I doubt it could ring...!
Leads to:
"This clock is missing its clockwork!"The batteries are dead







Phoenix:
The batteries on that clock must be dead!
Judge:
"Must be," Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Your Honor, if you would inspect the clock...!
Judge:
Hmm... very well. ... Oh!
Phoenix:
Well, Your Honor? Are they...?
Judge:
This clock has graver problems than dead batteries!
Leads to:
"This clock is missing its clockwork!"Judge:
This clock is missing its clockwork! It's quite empty! Mr. Wright! Would you care to explain to the court the meaning of this?Phoenix:
It is as you can see. The "clock" was empty. It couldn't have rung! Therefore, this witness... is a big, fat liar!April:
F-fat!?Phoenix:
Well, Miss May?Edgeworth:
Tsk tsk.Phoenix:
?Edgeworth:
Quite a show you've put on for us, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:
(He knew the clock was empty! Somehow... he knew!)Edgeworth:
I'm afraid you've forgotten one thing, however. Indeed, the clock is empty. As you say... it can't ring. However, we must ask: when was the clockwork removed? If it was after the witness heard the clock, then there is no contradiction!Judge:
! Hmm! That's true. That is a possibility. The clock might have been emptied after she heard it.Edgeworth:
And that is exactly what happened, Your Honor!Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? Can you prove when the clockwork was removed?Edgeworth:
Ho hoh! Impossible, of course...Phoenix:
I have proof.Edgeworth:
W-what!?Phoenix:
Wasn't it you who told me "proof is everything"? Well, I was listening. And now I'll show you the "proof" you like so much! The evidence that proves when the clockwork was removed is...Present Maya's Cell Phone







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Take a look at this!"Present anything else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What do you say to that?
April:
W-what? I don't rightly understand what that's supposed to mean!
Judge:
I don't rightly understand either.
Edgeworth:
Ho hoh!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh... I think I blew it.)
Judge:
Mr. Wright, please refrain from flippant presentations of evidence in the future.
Phoenix:
S-sorry, Your Honor!
Leads back to:
"The evidence that proves when the clockwork was removed is..."Phoenix:
Take a look at this!Judge:
Hmm. That's a very cute cell phone.April:
Ooh hoo! You have a girlie phone!Phoenix:
W-wait! Wait! This isn't my phone! Listen! This is the defendant's cell phone, and it contains a recording... A recording of a conversation she had with the victim on the day of the murder!Judge:
Order! Order!Edgeworth:
The defendant's cell phone!? Th-this wasn't brought to my attention!Phoenix:
Perhaps Detective Gumshoe overlooked it?Edgeworth:
*grumble* (The good detective better remember he's up for evaluation soon...)Phoenix:
(I gotta say, I'm starting to feel bad for the big fella.) (Changed from [My heart goes out to you, Edgeworth. Not.] in the original release) Let's hear the conversation.Cellular:*beep*...Maya:
[So you just want me to hold on to "The Thinker" for you, then?]Mia:
[If you could. Ah... I should probably tell you, the clock isn't talking right now.]Maya:
[Huh? It's not working? That's lame!]Mia:
[I had to take the clockwork out, sorry.]...[September 5, 9:27 AM]Cellular:*beep*Phoenix:
Your Honor, I think this makes it clear the clockwork was already gone by the time this was recorded, (Changed from [I think this recording makes it clear that the clockwork was already gone...] in the original release) which was well before the witness even arrived at her hotel! (Changed from [and this was recorded in the morning, before the witness even arrived at her hotel!] in the original release)April:
Muh... muh... muh!?Phoenix:
Well, Miss May? Would you care to explain this to the court? Just how did you know that weapon was a clock!?April:
... W-well...! Well, isn't it o-obvious? I saw that clock before! Um... what store was that again? I-I go to so many! Oops! I forgot! *wink*Judge:
So the witness had seen it before. That would make sense. Does the defense have any objections, Mr. Wright?Yes







Leads to:
"The witness claims she had "seen it before.""No







Phoenix:
Oh right... well, if she had seen it before, I guess... (Wait a second!)
Judge:
Then, the court would like--
Phoenix:
Hold on! P-please wait, Your Honor!
Judge:
Y-yes...? So you do have an objection?
Phoenix:
Um, yes, well...
Judge:
Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Sorry, Your Honor, it's just...
Leads to:
"The witness claims she had "seen it before.""Phoenix:
The witness claims she had "seen it before." But this directly contradicts a piece of evidence already submitted to this court!Judge:
Well then, let's see it. Please produce this evidence that will prove the witness had not seen the clock before.Present The Thinker







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"It's simple."Present anything else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Here is undeniable proof!
Edgeworth:
Hah!? Please, this is a court case, not some surrealist performance art piece!
Judge:
Hmm... Perhaps the defense would like to change its mind?
Leads back to:
"Please produce this evidence that will prove the witness had not seen the clock before."Phoenix:
It's simple. This clock was never in any store, ever!April:
W-whaaat!?Phoenix:
A friend of mine made that clock. Only two exist in the world. And the one that isn't here is in police custody!April:
I-impossible! Everything is sold in stores!Phoenix:
Miss May, I think it's high time you went shopping for a better excuse...?April:
Mmpf...Phoenix:
Oh? Excuses not on sale today?April:
Oooh? Oh ho ho. Mmmrrrrph! Ooooorrrrrrr ggggghhhhhhh... hhh!!! What's it to you, porcupine-head!? That stupid clock doesn't matter, okay!? She did it! And she should die for it! Die!Judge:
W-w-whoa! Let's not get ahead of ourselves. T-this is a court of law, and the witness will remain calm!April:
Hrrrgh... hrrrh... Hrrr... heh. Oh? Oh! Oh? Oh hoh ho! S-silly me! *grunt* Did I, um, like... lose it? I guess I did. Tee hee! *wink*Phoenix:
(S-scary...)Judge:
Miss May, let me ask. Tell me, how did you know the weapon was a clock?April:
...Judge:
Hmm... oh dear. Does the defense have an opinion on this... behavior?Phoenix:
(Okay, this is it!) Yes, Your Honor. Allow me to explain how I see the truth of the matter. Miss April May, you knew the weapon was a clock because...You held it







Phoenix:
(This is familiar territory. I'll just use the same approach as with Larry.) Miss May held that very clock in her hands!
Judge:
Mr. Wright! When was this!?
Phoenix:
When she used it to strike the victim! When else?
Judge:
Order! Order! Mr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!?
Phoenix:
April May, you killed Mia Fey, I say! And when you struck, the force of the impact made "The Thinker" ring! That's when you heard it!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
... Tsk tsk. You truly are a work of art, Mr. Phoenix Wright.
Phoenix:
W-what's that supposed to mean!?
Edgeworth:
It was you who just proved that "The Thinker" was empty!
Phoenix:
Oh... (Urk! Of course it wouldn't ring!)
Edgeworth:
What's more, the witness has a rock-solid alibi. Miss May? Perhaps you could explain to the poor, misguided Mr. Wright? You were in the hotel at the time of the murder.
Phoenix:
(S-she can't prove it! She did it!)
April:
It would be MY pleasure!
Phoenix:
N-no way!
April:
Yes way, Mr. Lawyer. Tee hee? Didn't the murder take place at 9:00 at night? Gee, that's the exact time I ordered some room service from the hotel bellboy!
Edgeworth:
Incidentally, the bellboy corroborates the witness's story. Ergo, she was not at the crime scene! Rock solid!
Judge:
Mr. Wright! You've just made a serious accusation to a perfectly innocent woman!
Phoenix:
S-sorry, Your Honor. (That... didn't go so well. But, if that's the case... Then how did she know "The Thinker" was a clock!? ... Wait!) Your Honor, I figured it out! There is one other way Miss April May could have known it was a clock! One way alone! And I have proof!
Judge:
Well... proof, you say? Then, the court will examine your proof, Mr. Wright. How did the witness know "The Thinker" was a clock?



Present Maya's Cell Phone







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
The defendant's cell phone.
Judge:
Yes, we've seen that already.
Phoenix:
Take another listen to the conversation between the defendant and victim.
Cellular:

Maya:
[Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while.]
Mia:
[Well, actually there's something I want you to hold on to for me.]
Maya:
[Again? What's it this time?]
Mia:
[It's... a clock. It's made to look like that statue, "The Thinker." And it tells you the time!]

...

Judge:
They do mention "The Thinker." But how would the witness know of this conversation? Do you have proof that she knew of the conversation?



Present Wiretap







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Have a look at this."




Present anything else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
(Wait... no, this can't be right! I can't afford any mistakes now!)
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Your evidence, please!
Leads back to:
"Do you have proof that she knew of the conversation?"


Phoenix:
Have a look at this.
April:
Ah! Oooh! Th-that!? Eh heh...
Phoenix:
I found this in Miss May's room.
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Please explain to the court what this is!
Phoenix:
Miss April May! You used a wiretap to listen to this conversation! That's how you knew "The Thinker" was a clock! Am I wrong!?
April:
I... I...
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Your Honor, this is ridiculous!
Phoenix:
Your Honor, look at the witness's face? Does she seem amused to you!? The defense demands an answer.
April:
La... laaa... lrrrrgf!
Judge:
Witness, answer the question. Did you tap her phone?
April:
...
Judge:
Miss May!
April:
Shut up, all of you! What gives you the right to talk to ME like that! You... you LAWYER!
......
April:
I-it's no fair! All of you g-ganging up on me like that... Oh, so I'm the bad girl, is that it? Is that it!? Uh... uh... uwaaaaaaah!
Phoenix:
(That did it! The court's seen the real Miss April May now! Now to deal the final blow!)



You did it, didn't you?







Phoenix:
Miss May, confess. You did it, didn't you?
April:
Are you out of your mind!? Oh wait, I forgot... you're a lawyer! You must be! At the time of the murder... I was in my hotel room, getting room service! How could I have killed her? If you don't believe me, just ask the bellboy!
Leads to:
"Well, does the defense have anything to say?"




Why the wiretap?







Phoenix:
Miss May... Why did you tap her phone?
April:
...
Phoenix:
Answer the question!
April:
Do I have to? Isn't this a murder trial? Isn't tippity-tapping er... irrelevant?
Phoenix:
(Gah! She's saying exactly what Edgeworth wants her to say.) Miss May. You were tapping the victim's phone! I hardly call that "irrelevant"!
Judge:
While this court does not condone the defense's tone of voice, he has a point. (Changed from [While this court does not condone the defense's tone of speech, he has a point.] in the original release) Well, Miss May? Do you have an explanation for the court? Can you prove you had nothing to do with this murder, even though you tapped her phone?
April:
At the time of the murder... I was in my hotel room, getting room service! How could I have killed her? If you don't believe me, just ask the bellboy!

April:
Oooh. Oooooh!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Your Honor, This is irrelevant!
Judge:
I'm not entirely sure that it is. Objection overruled. It troubles me that our witness was in possession of a wiretap.
Edgeworth:
This is outrageous! Does the defense truly claim that the witness was tapping her phone?
Phoenix:
Absolutely!
Edgeworth:
Even if that was the case, (which it's not) you still have to prove one thing! Did the victim ever say that the weapon was a clock on the phone? Can you prove that? I THINK NOT!
Phoenix:
Oh yeah? I THINK I CAN! It's simple!
Edgeworth:
WHAAAAT!?
Phoenix:
Here's my proof. The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is...



Present Maya's Cell Phone







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"I present the defendant's cell phone."




Present anything else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
This! I think...
Judge:
That's not going to prove anything, Mr. Wright. I think...
Phoenix:
W-wait! That was just a warm up!
Judge:
Hmm! Okay, once again. And I expect real proof this time!
Leads back to:
"The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is..."

Phoenix:
This evidence reveals the truth of the matter!
Judge:
What does it reveal, exactly?
Edgeworth:
The mad delusions of the defense, perhaps?
Phoenix:
(Uh oh, bad reaction. Maybe that wasn't the thing...)
Judge:
I'm afraid it has revealed a certain over-eagerness... Let me ask again:
Leads back to:
"How did the witness know "The Thinker" was a clock?"You had heard about it







Phoenix:
The witness had never held the clock in her hand! However, she had heard that it was a clock!
Judge:
She "heard"...?
Phoenix:
That is correct, Your Honor. There is no other way she could have known "The Thinker" was a clock! And I can show you the proof!
Judge:
Well, this is interesting. Let's see it, then. Show me evidence proving that the witness had "heard" the murder weapon was a clock.

What is it you little shrimp! Talk to me in that tone of voice will you!?
Phoenix:
You killed her, didn't you!
Judge:
Order! There will be order!
April:
What? How can you possibly say that!? Are you mad? A-all I did was a little wiretap... Oops!
Phoenix:
So you admit you tapped her phone!
April:
Heh... heh... hrrah! B-but wait! I didn't do ANYTHING bad like murder! I'm a good girl!
Phoenix:
Really? Can you prove it!? (No way can she prove it!)
April:
You think you're so smart, Mr. Lawyer... But I can prove it! And I will!
Phoenix:
You can't be serious! No way!
April:
Way, I say! Way! Oh, and I assure you I'm serious, Mr. Lawyer! Hmph! Okay? So, the killing happened around 9:00 at night? Why, that's just when I was getting room service from that sweet bellboy...
Phoenix:
R-room service!?
April:
Ice coffee, I believe it was? Ice coffee? You know? Like normal coffee, but COLD. If you don't drink it quick, the ice melts and then you have... regular cold coffee.
Phoenix:
I-ice coffee...!?
April:
Think I'm making this up? Ask the bellboy! *wink*
Edgeworth:
Ergo, the witness was not on the scene at the time of the murder!
Phoenix:
!
Judge:
So, where does that leave us...?
Edgeworth:
It is my great displeasure to inform you... That the witness appears to have been tapping the victim's telephone. However! That is a separate crime, with no bearing on the current case whatsoever! Her testimony stands! She saw the defendant, Maya Fey, commit murder!

April:
Well you're not the first man who's thought that! And of course... I can, and will!

Miss April May! You used a wiretap to listen to this conversation! That's how you knew "The Thinker" was a clock! Am I wrong!?
April:
I... I...
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Your Honor, this is ridiculous!
Phoenix:
Your Honor, look at the witness's face? Does she seem amused to you!? The defense demands an answer.
April:
La... laaa... lrrrrgf!
Judge:
Witness, answer the question. Did you tap her phone?
April:
...
Judge:
Miss May!
April:
Shut up, all of you! What gives you the right to talk to ME like that! You... you LAWYER!
......
April:
I-it's no fair! All of you g-ganging up on me like that... Oh, so I'm the bad girl, is that it? Is that it!? Uh... uh... uwaaaaaaah!
Phoenix:
(That did it! The court's seen the real Miss April May now! Now to deal the final blow!)



You did it, didn't you?







Phoenix:
Miss May!
April:
What is it you little shrimp! Talk to me in that tone of voice will you!?
Phoenix:
You killed her, didn't you!
Judge:
Order! There will be order!
April:
What? How can you possibly say that!? Are you mad? A-all I did was a little wiretap... Oops!
Phoenix:
So you admit you tapped her phone!
April:
Heh... heh... hrrah! B-but wait! I didn't do ANYTHING bad like murder! I'm a good girl!
Phoenix:
Really? Can you prove it!? (No way can she prove it!)
April:
You think you're so smart, Mr. Lawyer... But I can prove it! And I will!
Phoenix:
You can't be serious! No way!
April:
Way, I say! Way! Oh, and I assure you I'm serious, Mr. Lawyer! Hmph! Okay? So, the killing happened around 9:00 at night? Why, that's just when I was getting room service from that sweet bellboy...
Phoenix:
R-room service!?
April:
Ice coffee, I believe it was? Ice coffee? You know? Like normal coffee, but COLD. If you don't drink it quick, the ice melts and then you have... regular cold coffee.
Phoenix:
I-ice coffee...!?
April:
Think I'm making this up? Ask the bellboy! *wink*
Edgeworth:
Ergo, the witness was not on the scene at the time of the murder!
Phoenix:
!
Judge:
So, where does that leave us...?
Edgeworth:
It is my great displeasure to inform you... That the witness appears to have been tapping the victim's telephone. However! That is a separate crime, with no bearing on the current case whatsoever! Her testimony stands! She saw the defendant, Maya Fey, commit murder!
Phoenix:
(No! They're going to let her just walk away! There's no way I can win this unless I tie Miss May to the murder somehow...)
Leads to:
"Well, does the defense have anything to say?"




Why the wiretap?







Phoenix:
Why did you tap her phone?
April:
...
Phoenix:
Answer the question!
April:
Do I have to? Isn't this a murder trial? Isn't tippity-tapping er... irrelevant?
Phoenix:
(Gah! She's saying exactly what Edgeworth wants her to say.) Miss May. You were tapping the victim's phone! I hardly call that "irrelevant"!
Judge:
While this court does not condone the defense's tone of voice, he has a point. (Changed from [While this court does not condone the defense's tone of speech, he has a point.] in the original release) Well, Miss May? Do you have an explanation for the court? Can you prove you had nothing to do with this murder, even though you tapped her phone?
Phoenix:
(Hah! I'd like to see her pull THAT off!)
April:
Mr. Lawyer, I saw that evil, evil grin! You were probably thinking "I'd like to see her pull THAT off," weren't you!
Phoenix:
(Damn... she's good!)
April:
Well you're not the first man who's thought that! And of course... I can, and will!
Phoenix:
You can't be serious! No way!
April:
Way, I say! Way! Oh, and I assure you I'm serious, Mr. Lawyer! Hmph! Okay? So, the killing happened around 9:00 at night? Why, that's just when I was getting room service from that sweet bellboy...
Phoenix:
R-room service!?
April:
Ice coffee, I believe it was? Ice coffee? You know? Like normal coffee, but COLD. If you don't drink it quick, the ice melts and then you have... regular cold coffee.
Phoenix:
I-ice coffee...!?
April:
Think I'm making this up? Ask the bellboy! *wink*
Edgeworth:
Ergo, the witness was not on the scene at the time of the murder!
Phoenix:

Judge:
So, where does that leave us...?
Edgeworth:

Phoenix:
(No! They're going to let her just walk away! There's no way I can win this unless I tie Miss May to the murder somehow...)
Leads to:
"Well, does the defense have anything to say?"





Present anything else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
This is my evidence!
Judge:
I'm afraid I'm not sure where you are going with all of this, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Um... "where"? Well, it's not so much a place as a... er...
Edgeworth:
Come to the end of your bluff, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
W-wait! Wait! That was, uh, practice! Here's the real evidence!
Judge:
Mr. Wright, this court does not condone the presentation of evidence for "practice." Let's see your evidence, for real this time, Mr. Wright.
Leads back to:
"Show me evidence proving that the witness had "heard" the murder weapon was a clock."Judge:
Well, does the defense have anything to say?Phoenix:
Um, well... (Come on, think of something!)Call the bellboy as a witness







Phoenix:
The defense would like to call the hotel bellboy as a witness! There's something suspicious there, and I'm going to get to the bottom of it!
April:
I think you've sunken quite low enough already.
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
I object to calling the bellboy!
Phoenix:
W-why? What's your reason?
Edgeworth:
Because I hold that the wiretapping had nothing to do with the killing!
Phoenix:
...!
Edgeworth:
However... If you agree to one condition, I'll consent to calling this witness.
Phoenix:
Condition...?
Edgeworth:
If Miss April May's alibi is not called into question after you examine the bellboy... Then you will recognize that Miss April May was not the killer, thus she is innocent! Therefore you must accept the verdict of "guilty" for Ms. Maya Fey! That is my condition.
Phoenix:
(What...!? I'd better find something suspicious in that bellboy's testimony... Otherwise Maya will be declared "guilty" on the spot! What should I do...?)



Accept the condition







Phoenix:
(Alright! I've got nothing to lose! Except for... well, everything!) Understood. I accept your condition.
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Fool... You fell right into my trap!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh!) Uh... um, wait...
Leads to:
"Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand!"




Give up







Phoenix:
(Grr! I can't accept those conditions!) Very well. The defense will refrain from calling the bellboy as a witness.
Judge:
I see. You may continue your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Right. On with the cross-examination.
Edgeworth:
What exactly do you have left to examine, Mr. Wright? Miss April May has admitted to the wiretap, yes. But that bears no relevance to the case at hand: murder! There's no way you can prove any connection!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh! Think! This can't be the end... but I'm out of evidence!)
Judge:
Then I believe the cross-examination is over. Mr. Edgeworth, does the prosecution have any other witnesses to call?
Edgeworth:
None, Your Honor. She's the last.
Phoenix:
(What!? B-but that means... Maya's guilty...!?) W-wait! Your Honor!
Judge:
Yes, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
The defense would like to call the bellboy after all!
Edgeworth:
... Tsk tsk tsk... As I thought!
Phoenix:
...?
Edgeworth:
May I remind you, dear Mr. Wright. Should you question the bellboy... and Miss April May's alibi prove to be solid... then, by default, your client Ms. Maya Fey will be pronounced "guilty"! Are you prepared to accept my condition?
Phoenix:
(Edgeworth... He's got me backed into a corner... But I don't see any other way to take this!) I accept!
Leads to:
"Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand!"Continue examining Miss May







Phoenix:
Right. On with the cross-examination.
Edgeworth:
What exactly do you have left to examine, Mr. Wright? Miss April May has admitted to the wiretap, yes. But that bears no relevance to the case at hand: murder! There's no way you can prove any connection!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh! Think! This can't be the end... but I'm out of evidence!)
Judge:
Then I believe the cross-examination is over. Mr. Edgeworth, does the prosecution have any other witnesses to call?
Edgeworth:
None, Your Honor. She's the last.
Phoenix:
(What!? B-but that means... Maya's guilty...!?) W-wait! Your Honor!
Judge:
Yes, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
The defense would like to call the bellboy after all!
Edgeworth:
... Tsk tsk tsk... As I thought!
Phoenix:
...?
Edgeworth:
May I remind you, dear Mr. Wright. Should you question the bellboy... and Miss April May's alibi prove to be solid... then, by default, your client Ms. Maya Fey will be pronounced "guilty"! Are you prepared to accept my condition?
Phoenix:
(Edgeworth... He's got me backed into a corner... But I don't see any other way to take this!) I accept!
Leads to:
"Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand!"Judge:
Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand!Edgeworth:
I believe we're ready for the witness to testify. He certainly does look like a bellboy.Bellboy:
Yes, sir. I received your summons in the middle of work, sir. I'm happy to be of service.Judge:
That tea set looks rather heavy, so without further ado, the witness may begin his testimony.Bellboy:
Very good, sir!Witness Testimony-- Miss May's Room Service --Bellboy:
I am the head bellboy at the fine Gatewater Hotel, in business for four generations!
I believe I received a call after 8:00 in the evening from our guest, Miss May.
She asked for an ice coffee to be brought to her at 9:00, on the dot, sir.
I brought it to her at precisely the requested time, of course.
And I delivered the ice coffee to our guest Miss May, herself.Judge:
I see. The defense may begin its cross-examination.Phoenix:
R-right! I'm ready. (I hope... This is it... If I can't prove Miss May was involved with the murder now... Maya will be finished!)Cross Examination-- Miss May's Room Service --Bellboy:

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What exactly is it you do at the hotel?
Bellboy:
Why, anything required of me, sir. I check in guests, I check out guests. I clean rooms, I make beds. I even deliver room service, sir. I checked Miss May in personally.
Phoenix:
Are you always so... so prim?
Judge:
Mr. Wright. You will refrain from asking frivolous questions...Bellboy:
I believe I received a call after 8:00 in the evening from our guest, Miss May.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Are you sure it was Miss May on the phone?
Bellboy:
Absolutely, sir.
Phoenix:
H-how can you be so certain!?
Bellboy:
I checked Miss May in personally, sir. Not only did I see her in all her stunning radiance, but I also heard her voice. And then I saw THEM, and I... Ahem. Er... ahem! The point being, I remembered her quite well, sir.
Judge:
Yes, what then?Bellboy:
She asked for an ice coffee to be brought to her at 9:00, on the dot, sir.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
9:00 "on the dot," you say?
Bellboy:
Yes. I confirmed that detail several times. She was watching a program on the TV, and wished to drink after she finished, sir.
Phoenix:
(9:00... the time of the murder!)Bellboy:
I brought it to her at precisely the requested time, of course.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
"Precisely" 9:00, then?
Bellboy:
Precisely, exactly, and most definitely, sir, 9:00 PM.
Phoenix:
How can you be so sure!?
Bellboy:
Miss May was quite insistent that it be brought then. "Oh, bellboy? Tee hee! I'd like, like, ice coffee at exactly 9:00!" Something like that, sir. Therefore, I knocked on her door at the crack of 9:00, sir.
Phoenix:
(Why would she be so particular about the time?)Bellboy:
And I delivered the ice coffee to our guest Miss May, herself.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
You are sure it was Miss April May herself?
Bellboy:
Ab-SO-lutely, sir.
Phoenix:
"Ab-SO-lutely"...?
Bellboy:
Yes, sir. As in, "so very absolutely," sir. It's an endearing mannerism of mine.
Phoenix:
How come you're so very certain!?
Bellboy:
Well, when I brought the room service, sir... S-she... the guest, sir, favored me w-with a, um, an "embrasser," sir.
Phoenix:
"Embrasser"!? Is that French for "embrace"?
Bellboy:
It's French for "kiss," sir. But not a french kiss, sir! More of a peck on the cheek.
Phoenix:
Wh-why would she have done that...?
Bellboy:
I believe, perhaps, she was momentarily swayed by my prim demeanor, sir. It was a moment I shall never, ever forget, sir.
Phoenix:
(Sounds pretty fishy to me... I think our Miss May was up to something and wanted the bellboy to remember her!)Phoenix:
(This bellboy wouldn't have any reason to lie... But I have to find something to use in his testimony! One more time. I'll press him until he spills the beans... or his tea!)After pressing fourth and fifth statements:Phoenix:
... It's no good! (There's nothing there! Is... is that it!?)Edgeworth:
Tsk tsk. Finally, you understand. This bellboy has absolutely no reason to lie! Now... If you have any decency, you will end this rather tedious cross-examination here!Judge:
Hmm. It was a bit tedious. The witness may leave the stand.Phoenix:
(I can't let this happen... can I?)Protest







Leads to:
"W-wait! Please wait!"Give up







Phoenix:
(No...! If I give up now, I lose everything... If I just give up the case, I'd be giving up the very reason I became a lawyer!)
Leads to:
"W-wait! Please wait!"Phoenix:
W-wait! Please wait!Judge:
Yes? Does the defense have something to add?Phoenix:
One last question... let me ask one last question!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
Your Honor, I must object. This charade of justice has gone on long enough!Judge:
Now, now, Mr. Edgeworth. Alright Mr. Wright. I'll give you one more question, that's all.Phoenix:
(Okay. This is really it, now. This is my last chance! What do I ask him about...!?)Check-in







Phoenix:
T-tell me about check-in! Tell me about when you checked-in Miss May.
Bellboy:
Oh, alright. Very well, sir. My first thought was that she was a beautiful, beautiful person. She's just my type of girl, so it was a disappointment, really.
Phoenix:
I see... ? Excuse me... what exactly was a "disappointment"?
Bellboy:
Well, I am not without charm, sir, but even I'd have little chance with her lover there.
Phoenix:
(...! What did he say!?) What did you say!?
Bellboy:
Ah! Oh... er... rather, quite!
Phoenix:
Bellboy! Tell us the truth now... Did Miss May check in with another person?
Edgeworth:

Leads to:
"I object! That was... objectionable!"Room service







Phoenix:
T-tell me again about er... room service!
Bellboy:
A-again, sir? At exactly 9:00, I delivered room service to Miss May in room 303. The guest had requested ice coffee... $18 was the charge, as I recall.
Phoenix:
I see... ...? E-eighteen dollars? Doesn't that seem a bit expensive?
Bellboy:
Y-yes, well, ice coffee for two, you know. And we don't skimp on the ice, sir.
Phoenix:
(...! What did he say!?) What did you say!?
Bellboy:
Ah! Oh... er... rather, quite!
Phoenix:
Bellboy! Tell us the truth now... Was someone else staying in Miss May's room?
Edgeworth:

Leads to:
"I object! That was... objectionable!"Bed making







Phoenix:
Bed... bed making! Tell me about making beds that day.
Edgeworth:
I was wondering what you were going to ask, but bed making? A new low!
Judge:
Now, now, Mr. Edgeworth. The witness will answer the defense's question.
Bellboy:
Yes, well, it was quite like any other day's bed making. I changed the sheets, the pillowcases, and then I proceeded to make the bed. I had to bring pillows for two, of course, but they're quite light, you see.
Phoenix:
I see. Thank you. ... (Pillows... for two!?) Bellboy! What did you just say?
Bellboy:
Eh!? Ah, yes, pillows are light... sir?
Phoenix:
Bellboy! Tell us the truth now... Was someone else staying in Miss May's room?
Edgeworth:

Leads to:
"I object! That was... objectionable!"Edgeworth:
I object! That was... objectionable!Judge:
... Objection overruled. The witness will answer the question.Bellboy:
Er... yes, I see.Phoenix:
Why did you not mention this in your testimony!?Bellboy:
W-well, sir, you er... you didn't ask!Phoenix:
(Nice try!) That's the sort of thing you're normally supposed to mention!Bellboy:
Ah, yes, quite. Indeed... It was the, er, good barrister there, Mr. Edgeworth, who...Phoenix:
!Bellboy:
He asked me not to mention it if I wasn't specifically asked, sir.Edgeworth:
Oof! Y-you fool!Phoenix:
I've done it... I've won!Phoenix:
Miss April May checked into a twin room... with a man. Correct?Bellboy:
Yes, sir.Phoenix:
Then, when you brought them room service, you didn't see that man in the room...?Bellboy:
That's right, sir.Judge:
Hmm...Phoenix:
Your Honor! We have just learned of another person involved who may have been the murderer! In light of this new fact, I hold that it's impossible to judge the defendant. (Changed from [In this new light, I hold that it's impossible to judge the defendant.] in the original release) You agree, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:
And who, Mr. Wright! Who is this "other person"! (Changed from [Who! Who is this 'other person'!] in the original release)Phoenix:
Simple, it was...Miss April May







Phoenix:
None other than Miss April May!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Eh!? Have you heard nothing that has transpired so far!? She has an alibi! She was in the hotel at the time of the murder!
Phoenix:
Oh... right.
Judge:
Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
S-sorry, Your Honor! Give me one more chance!
Leads back to:
"Simple, it was..."The man with Miss May







Leads to:
"The man who checked in with Miss May!"The Bellboy







Phoenix:
It was the bellboy and none other!
Judge:
Well, this comes as some surprise...
Edgeworth:
Your Honor, Mr. Wright... It was the bellboy who confirmed Miss May's alibi... And this in turn confirms the bellboy's alibi! He was in the hotel!
Phoenix:
Well, s-sure... if you put it that way...
Edgeworth:
I do put it that way, and I trust you will too!
Phoenix:
But what if they were in cahoots!
Judge:
You have evidence of this?
Phoenix:
Um... no, Your Honor.
Judge:
Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
S-sorry, Your Honor! Give me one more chance!
Leads back to:
"Simple, it was..."Phoenix:
The man who checked in with Miss May!Edgeworth:
Oof!Phoenix:
Your Honor! As has been previously revealed, Miss April May was tapping the victim's phone. Yet Miss May herself has an alibi at the time of the murder. However, that does not clear the man that was with her! The bellboy saw no one else in the room at the time of the murder!!!Edgeworth:
M-my, what a convenient little setup... but it's too late...Phoenix:
"Too late"? I suppose you'd like it if it was too late, wouldn't you... After all, it was you who hid the presence of the other man from this court!Edgeworth:
Oof! Upstart... amateur...! T-these accusations are... ludicrous!Judge:
Enough! The court acknowledges the defense's argument. I expect the prosecution and defense to look into this matter fully! Am I understood?Edgeworth:
Yes... *gasp* Yes, Your Honor.Judge:
That is all today for the trial of Maya Fey. Court is adjourned!September 7, 2:24 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Maya:

Then again, that other attorney was pretty cool, too...Phoenix:
Huh?Maya:
That face of his! With his eyes wide, and trembling lips! It sent shivers up my spine!Phoenix:
Hmm... if you say so.Maya:
So, what happens with me? Do I get to go home now?Phoenix:
Um, well... (Changed from [Well, no.] in the original release) No, I don't think so. Not yet. (Changed from [I don't think so. Not yet.] in the original release)Maya:
Oh... I see.Phoenix:
But I got a great lead in today's trial!Maya:
A "lead"?Phoenix:
That man with Miss May! He's the key!Maya:
Oh! I get it. What happened to Miss May after that, anyway?Phoenix:
I heard they arrested her. I guess she's learning her charms won't work everywhere. She's probably at the detention center now. I may have to go down there later. Anyway. This case is far from closed.Maya:
Yes sir!Phoenix:
I'm going to find out more about this man.Maya:
Do you think he was the one who...?Phoenix:
Maybe so.Maya:
Sis...Phoenix:
Don't worry, I'll find him by tomorrow. I promise.Maya:
I'm counting on you!Phoenix:
I asked for a full record of April May's testimony. I thought it might come in handy during the trial tomorrow. But now that I have it, I'm not so sure. Most of her testimony was all lies... In fact, there's only one part that hasn't been stricken from the record. (Changed from [In fact, there's only one part that got left on the record.] in the original release)May Testimony added to the Court Record.Phoenix:
I don't know how much good this will do me at all, now. Anyway, time to hit the pavement and do some investigating! Maya doesn't belong in that detention center, and it's up to me to set her free!

Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
Judge:
... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Ugh. I must be on the wrong track?)Too many penalties







Judge:
That's enough! This court see no reason to further prolong the trial. The defense has failed to give the court sufficient reason to doubt the prosecution's claim! This court find the defendant, Ms. Maya Fey...

Guilty

Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!Turnabout Sisters

Well hello! I didn't expect anyone to visit me in such a dank place as this... It's really quite... moving. Not! You stinking lawyer! I hope you die! Have you come to laugh? Yes, laugh at the fallen Miss May!Phoenix:
No, not really, there's something I wanted to ask.April:
Unfortunately, there is nothing I want to BE asked. Haven't you done enough questioning, you...! Spiky-head!Phoenix:
(Here we go again...) Please, you're scaring the security guard.April:
... So? What is it you wish to ask of me, then? Hmm?Phoenix:
(For starters, how did you get to be so totally whacked!?)Examine









Security camera







Phoenix:
Smile for the camera...




Security guard







Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch. A real pro, this guy. Or maybe he just doesn't get to see a lot of women like Miss May in here.Talk









That "man"







Phoenix:
About the man who stayed with you in your hotel room...
April:
...
Phoenix:
Can you tell me about him? Where is he? C'mon...
April:
No way, Jose.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... maybe if I had something to get her to talk...)




The wiretap







Phoenix:
Why did you place a wiretap on Mia's phone?
April:
Aww, when you say it like that it sounds so... cold. So criminal!
Phoenix:
Um... tapping people's phones is a crime, Miss May.
April:
Oh, and I suppose you learned that in Lawyer School, hmm? Creep!
Phoenix:
(This woman is impossible to talk to...)




Your attitude







Phoenix:
Say... Why are you so... angry? I mean, you don't look like a bad person...
April:
Ooh, that does it! Bottom-feeding, scum-sucking lawyer!
Phoenix:
B-bottom...? (I can't tell, does she have a thing against lawyers... or just against me?)Present









Anything







April:
Hey, guess what. Actually, I, um, really hate your guts. So get lost. Because, well, I'm not cooperating.
Phoenix:
(Thanks, I noticed.)September 7Fey & Co. Law OfficesPhoenix:
Looks like forensics is taking the day off today. Detective Gumshoe's nowhere in sight. The police really gave this place a working over. I doubt there are any valuable clues left. Suppose it can't hurt to take a look around, though.Examine









Bookshelf







Phoenix:
You couldn't cram more legal books in here, even if you wanted to. All the cases that the chief worked on are filed here. Hmm. Are some of the files missing...? Nah, I'm imagining things.September 7Grossberg Law OfficesPhoenix:
(Huh. Looks like Grossberg is out today... again. Maybe he's avoiding me for some reason?)Examine









Photos on desk







Phoenix:
What's this? Old photos? There are two lying here. Something's been written in pencil on the backs. "DL-6 Incident - Exhibit A," "DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B"... Let's take a look at these...



"DL-6 Incident - Exhibit A"







Phoenix:
... I'm sure I've seen this person somewhere... Perhaps I'll borrow this photo. I'm sure no one will miss just one little photo. And it might be a valuable clue... I'll take it for now.
Photograph quietly added to the Court Record.
Leads back to examination




"DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B"







Phoenix:
Why would Grossberg have a picture of this man...? This might be a valuable clue... I'll take it for now. I'm just borrowing it. I'll return it later.
Photograph quietly added to the Court Record.
Leads back to examination




Leave them alone







Phoenix:
I don't need it now, whatever it is. If I ever run out of clues, I'll know where to find these. (Although I can't be sure the photos will still be here then...)
Leads back to examination





Photos on desk (after one has been added to the Court Record)







Phoenix:
A photo lies on the desk. Maybe I should switch it with the one I took?



Swap photos







Phoenix:
I think I'll swap them...
Photograph added to the Court Record.
Leads back to examination




Leave it alone







Phoenix:
No, on second thought, I'd better not.
Leads back to examination





Vacant wall







Phoenix:
Wait a second... Wasn't there a giant painting hanging on that wall...? Yeah... yeah, it was a painting of...



Sunflowers

That "man"







Phoenix:
About the man who stayed with you in your hotel room... Can you tell me about him? Where is he?
April:
I'm not telling!
Phoenix:
Look, he's being accused of murder! I don't think you want to be protecting him.
April:
Hmm. Would you have sold out the late Ms. Fey to the cops?
Phoenix:
No.
April:
See?

Phoenix:

Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B)







Phoenix:
Have a look at this.
April:
Look, I've said several times, I'm not telling you... ! Where did you...?
Phoenix:
(Ah hah! A reaction!) This is him, isn't it?
April:
What? Who? When? Why...?
Phoenix:
It IS him. This is the man who stayed in your hotel room the night of the murder!
April:
No! No, that's not right.
Phoenix:
(Nice try, Miss Cooperative.)
April:
D-do you have proof that was him? Hmm? Y-yeah! Proof! Show me proof!

Ah, welcome, sir! Quite the performance today, if I dare say so myself.Phoenix:
Oh, um, thanks. Sorry for putting you on the spot like that.Bellboy:
No, no, not at all, sir! Your efforts today can only help the Gatewater's "rep," as they say.Phoenix:
Huh? "Rep"?Bellboy:
Yes! Our reputation will swell as the hotel where the murderer used a wiretap! We can charge a premium for the room, of course. It will be great for business, sir!Phoenix:
Whoa, whoa! Miss May hasn't been charged with murder.Bellboy:
I, too, will become famous! "The Bellboy who brought the murderer ice coffee"...!Phoenix:
(Why do I feel like we're both stuck in the same bad dream...)Bellboy:
So! You are our honored guest. Please let me know if there is anything I can bring you!Examine









Flowers







Phoenix:
A vase, as expected. I'm not good with flower names, except maybe tulips and sunflowers.




Open drawer







Phoenix:
Huh? There's still a screwdriver stuck in that drawer!
Bellboy:
Ah, please leave that as it is, sir. That's the "Drawer of Terror, Hiding Place of the Murderer's Wiretap." It's set to become one of the most popular attractions here.
Phoenix:
(This guy's serious! I don't believe it...)




Table







Phoenix:
A bottle and two glasses rest on the table. Why hasn't he cleaned these up by now?
Bellboy:
Ah, I beg your pardon, sir, but if you could please refrain from touching those... It's part of the decor. I call it: "The last drink... before murder!" We'll be famous! The talk of the hotel industry!




Window







Phoenix:
Nice weather again today. I can see the Fey & Co. Law Offices, of course.
Bellboy:
Ah, yes. We plan to install a telescope in that window, of course. Just $5.00 will earn you three minutes of a "view to a kill"!
Phoenix:

Miss May







Phoenix:
About Miss May...
Bellboy:
Oh, her? Sir, not to boast but I knew the moment I saw her... "She'd do it!" I said!
Phoenix:
(Do WHAT!? I'm starting to think the most suspicious person here is this guy!)




The man with May







Phoenix:
I wanted to ask you about the man who was with Miss May...?
Bellboy:
Ah, yes... He struck me as a real "Lady Killer," if you'll pardon the expression. I knew it from the moment I saw him, sir. He and I are of the same ilk. We both carry the scent of... danger.
Phoenix:
(There we are in total agreement, Mr. Psycho Bellboy.)
Bellboy:
If you had a photo of that man, I'm quite sure I could identify him.
Phoenix:
(A photo. Hmm...)




The hotel







Phoenix:
Could you tell me about this hotel?
Bellboy:
Absolutely! And on that subject, I have an excellent idea, sir! Currently, this hotel is known as the "Gatewater." I propose that we add a subtitle!
Phoenix:
A subtitle!?
Bellboy:

Um... sounds great! (Whatever floats your tea set...)Present

Well, it's a fine photo, sir. However, the person Miss May was accompanied by was, well, a man.
Phoenix:
(Oh... yeah. Right.)




Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B)







Phoenix:
Take a look at this photo.
Bellboy:
... That's him, Detective.
Phoenix:
Um... I'm the lawyer.
Bellboy:
Oh, I know that! I just wanted to say "Detective" once. You know how it is.
Phoenix:
(No. No I don't.)
Bellboy:
Without a doubt, that is the man who checked in with Miss April May. How about I write an affidavit swearing that that's him!
Phoenix:
An affidavit? (This guy is way too excited about this...)



Have him write it







Phoenix:
Well, sure. Why not?
Bellboy:
Yes! I've always wanted to write an affidavit, sir. From hence forth I will be known as "The Bellboy who swore the affidavit"! (Changed from [From hence forth I will be known as the 'bellboy who swore the affidavit'!] in the original release)
Phoenix:
Just hurry up and write it.
Bellboy's Affidavit added to the Court Record.

Bellboy's Affidavit







Phoenix:
Could you have a look at this?
April:
What's that?
Phoenix:
The bellboy's affidavit! He told us everything he saw. He told us about the man you checked in with. He told us who he was.
April:
...!
Phoenix:
(Now I'm getting somewhere!)



Ease her fears







Phoenix:
(Okay, okay... she's vulnerable now. I should be gentle.) Miss May... It would be easy for me to hand this affidavit to the police.
April:
...
Phoenix:
If they get involved, wouldn't your boss be even more... er... inconvenienced? All I want to do is have a little chat with him. You won't tell me?
April:
... Is that all you have to say?
Phoenix:
Yes.
April:
Id it's so easy for you to "get the police involved," then why don't you? Somehow I think you're not up to it, hmm?
Phoenix:
(Show them a little kindness and they jump all over you! That had the opposite effect to what I hoped...)
April:
Aww. *smirk* Poor little lawyer... And you were so close!

(This is it, all or nothing! Time to do a little bluff.) No use playing dumb! (If, indeed, that's an act.) If you don't talk, I'm taking this photo to the press!
April:
Whaaaaat!?
Phoenix:
Even though he should've been witness to murder, your little "friend" is missing. (Changed from [Even though he should be a witness to murder, this man is in hiding.] in the original release) I'm sure the press would have a field day with his reputation!
April:
...! Ooooh! Fine! I'll talk! You... you win, Lawyer.
Phoenix:
(Yes! Man, that felt good! It's great to be alive!)
April:
Why are you pumping your fists in the air?
Phoenix:
*cough* Now, tell me about the man you were with.
April:
That man... He's my boss. Redd White, the president of the information gathering conglomerate, Bluecorp.
Phoenix:
(Redd... White?) "Information gathering?"
April:
Well... I suppose you could call it a detective agency. (Changed from [Well... I suppose you could call them a detective agency.] in the orignal release)
Phoenix:
Hmm... So this is the man that was with you the night of the murder?
April:
... I'm... I'm scared to talk. I don't want to end up like her!

Today's trial







Phoenix:
So you came to see the trial?
Grossberg:
Yes, yes I did. Something was bothering me all last night, you see. I couldn't get a wink of sleep.
Phoenix:
Really? What was that?
Grossberg:
Well, you see, it's just... Mia's sister, that poor girl. My boy, I owe you my thanks, truly. I don't know what I would have done if things had gone poorly for the girl.
Phoenix:
(If you were that worried about it, why didn't you offer to defend her!?)




Your refusal







Phoenix:
I asked before, but, why did you refuse her request for defense? I think I have a right to know.
Grossberg:
A right, Mr. Wright? No, no, I'm sorry. It's just, I need more time to think about it, my boy.
Phoenix:
... (He does seem troubled about something... Maybe I can find something that will inspire him to talk.)




That painting







Phoenix:
The other day I'm sure there was a big, pretentious-looking painting on that wall...
Grossberg:
"Pretentious-looking"...?
Phoenix:
Well... you know the one I mean. Anyway, where did it go?
Grossberg:
Ah, yes, well... I... got rid of it. Got quite tired of the thing, really. I, er, sold it, you see. Yes, that's right.
Phoenix:
(Sold it!? I'm not sure I buy that...) Wasn't that painting rather important to you, sir? Did something happen?

Grossberg:

Phoenix:
I borrowed it.
Grossberg:
Well, give it back at once!
Phoenix:
Mr. Grossberg. Tell me about the man in this photo. He may have been in that hotel room with April May on the night of the murder. Do you know something about him... anything?
Grossberg:
...! Hmm. Ahem! Very well. I'll tell you what I know. However... You didn't hear it from me, if you follow.
Phoenix:
I follow.
Grossberg:
That man is Mr. Redd White. He's the President of Bluecorp.
Phoenix:
(Redd White... Hmm.) Bluecorp... they're something like a detective agency, right?
Grossberg:
They're information pros. They sell information, you see. Sensitive information. Despite his name, Mr. White has the blackest reputation of any man in this country. Should you run across him, watch what you say. You wouldn't want him digging up any dirt on you.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... selling information. Sounds like blackmail.) Can you tell me where Bluecorp is located?
Grossberg:
Hmm... I suppose.

...? Haven't I seen this somewhere...? Is this a replica?
White:
Ridiculosity! I have no interest in anything but originals. That right there is a bona fide original! Worth five million, for sure.
Phoenix:

Statue







Phoenix:
A statue of a man holding up the world. The "Bluecorp" sign certainly stands out enough... The model for the man is, of course, Mr. White.
White:
Truly a work of art! But, probably to beautacious for you to appreciate, correct?
Phoenix:

Miss May







Phoenix:
Miss May is an employee of Bluecorp, is she not?
White:
Correct. She was my secretariat. What a shock it was to hear what she has done!
Phoenix:
"What she has done"... You mean the wiretap?
White:
Indeed! She is paid to answer phones. Tapping them is NOT in her job description. She does gather information for us as part of her duties. But, I assure you, we do not condone illegal methods! It is ineffable that she would do this.
Phoenix:
(It sounds like he's trying to turn Miss May into a scapegoat...)




Night of the murder







Phoenix:
On the night of the murder were you in April May's hotel room?
White:
Who can say? I seldom pay attention to mundane details such as time and place. My motto is: "Don't worry, be happy!"
Phoenix:
Still, Mr. White... The hotel bellboy has stated on the record that he does remember you very clearly.
White:
... No matter! The bellboy can say what he pleases. I still won't talk to you. If you want me to speak, put me on the witness stand! Although I doubt you'd be capable of doing that.
Phoenix:
(Hmm. He raises a good question, actually... Why didn't prosecution call him as a witness? He should have "seen" the same thing as April May!)
White:
Oh hoh hoh. The police... the courts... To me they are mere toys. Playthings for my amusement!




Bluecorp







Phoenix:
What kind of company is Bluecorp, anyway?
White:
Ah, excellent question! We buy and sell various kinds of information. We are a company of the future! You might say, we ARE the future!
Phoenix:
(Sell... information?)
White:
In just 10 years, I've built this business up into the grand office you see now. Ah, in case you were wondering, Bluecorp was named after the color "blue"! I, Redd White of Bluecorp, as founder and CEO, named it so! And why, you ask? Because I like the color blue of course! Fantabulistic, is it not?




That painting (appears after "Miss May" and "Night of the murder")







Phoenix:
Uh... there's something that's been bothering me.
White:
Yes? What might that be?
Phoenix:
That big painting on the wall over there...

White:
Gorgeous! That's a picture of me! Ah, I see it was taken in the prime of my youth. About 10 years ago, at a guess.
Phoenix:
The hotel bellboy says he saw this man on the night of the murder.
White:

M-m-my boy, please! You're letting your fancies run away with you! Where do you get these bizarre ideas?
Phoenix:
I... I don't understand how you could...
Grossberg:
That's because I'm not, we're not... Don't be ridiculous! ... Enough. I'll swallow my pride and tell you all.
Phoenix:
(I knew it! They are lovers!)
Grossberg:
N-no! We are NOT lovers!

That photo of Mr. White







Phoenix:
That photo of Mr. White... Why would you have his photo, Mr. Grossberg?
Grossberg:
Umm... yes, well. It's been a long time since then...
Phoenix:
A long time ago? I'm sorry... but I think not. I think you still have ties to Mr. White even today.
Grossberg:
R-really! Whatever gave you that idea! W-what connection could I possibly have to an individual such as he?
Phoenix:
It's pretty straightforward, actually...



You go drinking together







Phoenix:
You go drinking together! You're friends, aren't you?
Grossberg:
... Now you're being foolish, my boy. Why in the world would I ever drink with the likes of him!?
Phoenix:
(Huh? Whoops... maybe that wasn't it.)
Leads back to Talk options




He's blackmailing you







Phoenix:
Mr. White has something on you doesn't he? Blackmail?
Grossberg:
...! I don't... I don't know what you're talking about!
Phoenix:
Mr. Grossberg, sir... There was a giant painting hanging right there the other day, was there not? The one you said you had "no intention of parting with"? Well, I saw it. Today. It was in the CEO's office at Bluecorp. Redd White's office.
Grossberg:
... So... you noticed. I suppose I should have guessed you would. It is a large painting...
Phoenix:
Mr. Grossberg... tell me what happened.
Leads to:
"Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation."




He's giving you information







Phoenix:
Redd White is supplying you with information, obviously!
Grossberg:
What's that now?
Phoenix:
You've been protecting him all along. You protect him because you need his services!
Grossberg:
... Now you're being foolish, my boy. What possible use could I have for the services of the likes of him!?
Phoenix:
(Huh? Whoops... maybe that wasn't it.)
Leads back to Talk options





Why wouldn't you defend Maya?







Phoenix:
I thought it was strange. Here was Maya, your own apprentice's little sister, in desperate need... Accused of killing her own sister no less, and you wouldn't take the case! I finally realized why. You and Redd White are connected. He's...



Your boss







Phoenix:
I'll bet you and White go way back! He's your boss now, and was before, I bet!
Grossberg:
My what? Boss? Are you serious?
Phoenix:
Yeah! You both have that sort of "we're in the same club together" feel to you.
Grossberg:
Please, stop. You have a very peculiar sense of humor, Mr. Wright. Very well, I'll talk.
Phoenix:
(What does he mean... "sense of humor"? I was serious!)
Leads to:
"Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation."




Blackmailing you







Phoenix:
Mr. White has something on you doesn't he? Blackmail?
Grossberg:
...! I don't... I don't know what you're talking about!
Phoenix:
Mr. Grossberg, sir... There was a giant painting hanging right there the other day, was there not? The one you said you had "no intention of parting with"? Well, I saw it. Today. It was in the CEO's office at Bluecorp. Redd White's office.

Your lover







Phoenix:
It's not something I can claim to understand... But you and Mr. White are lovers, aren't you!
Grossberg:
W-w-what! My boy!
Phoenix:
Mr. Grossberg. The other day, there was a giant painting hanging on that wall. I saw that painting again, today. It was in the CEO's office of Bluecorp. It was a present, wasn't it?
Grossberg:
Well, my boy, you have a splendid imagination!
Phoenix:
I... I don't understand how you could...
Grossberg:
That's because I'm not, we're not... Don't be ridiculous!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... I guess I was wrong. But it just seemed so right!)

Anything







Grossberg:
Sorry, my boy. I don't think I can help you with that.Grossberg:
Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation. Bluecorp is a company that excels in finding people's weaknesses, I'm afraid. I've been paying them for 15 years now...Phoenix:
(15 years...!)Grossberg:
All because of the "DL-6 Incident," as you may have guessed.Phoenix:
(The name on the back of those photographs!)Grossberg:
As you suspected, I could not stand in defense of Maya because of this. White would have destroyed me if I did.Phoenix:
(So that's the connection!)Grossberg:
It is hard for me to tell you this, my boy. But arresting Redd White will be nigh on impossible.Phoenix:
Impossible? Why!?Grossberg:
He has information on everyone. It gives him an iron grip! He owns judges, attorneys, prosecutors, police... and politicians.Phoenix:
What!?Grossberg:
They are bound, unable to do harm to themselves, and therefore, to him. Don't look at me like that. What you see is nothing more than the weight of many years.Talk









The DL-6 Incident







Phoenix:
What is the "DL-6 Incident"?
Grossberg:
"DL-6" is nothing more than the sorting code the police gave the case. It was 15 years ago now... I received a request from a medium. A spirit medium.
Phoenix:
(A medium...?)
Grossberg:
Her name was Misty Fey.
Phoenix:
(Fey!)
Grossberg:
Indeed. She was Mia's mother. She had been investigating a murder at the bequest of the police. And... she failed. As a result, the police called her a fraud.
Phoenix:
(This is what Maya was talking about the other day!)
Grossberg:
I did all I could for her, and in the end, cleared her of wrongdoing. That murder case, however remains unsolved to this day. That case, is the DL-6 Incident.




Reason for blackmail







Phoenix:
But why were you blackmailed over this, Mr. Grossberg?
Grossberg:
The DL-6 Incident was top-secret at the time. It made sense. The police didn't want people to know they were using a medium! They couldn't let people know. But one person found out. I... I told him.
Phoenix:
You told White?
Grossberg:
He offered me riches... It is an embarrassment to me now. Because I talked, the police were mocked far and wide. In secret, they began looking for the one who sold them out. Of course White heard about it, and he came to me. Only this time, the offer was blackmail.
Phoenix:
... I see.
Grossberg:
... White controls the law of this country as he sees fit. Yet if you would still challenge him... Have a close look at Mia's office.
Phoenix:
Mia's office...?
Grossberg:
She followed his every move for years. She may have recorded something of what she found.Fey & Co. Law Offices (after clearing "Reason for blackmail" Talk option in Grossberg Law Offices)Phoenix:
It's funny, looking at this room, it seems... so normal. Hard to imagine a murder took place here. Mr. Grossberg said there would be clues... Maybe I should have another look.Examine









Bookshelf







Phoenix:
All the cases the chief ever worked on are filed here. They're in alphabetical order. Let's take a look... Which file should I look at...?



File "A-I"







Phoenix:
Let's see if there's "A" record in this file that catches my "I." "A"... "B"... "F"! "Misty Fey." That's Mia and Maya's mother. Hmmm... Should I take a look?



Read it







Mia:
"'I have tarnished the Fey name.' Leaving only these words, my mother vanished. I was determined to find the ones who had made my mother blame herself in this way. Using the E.S.P. that runs in my family, I held an audience with the dead. Finally, the names of two men surfaced. One was Marvin Grossberg, a lawyer who sold my mother's information for riches. The other was the man who sold that information to the press. This parasite, who makes his fortune on threats and coercion... His name is..."
Phoenix:
Hmm. The record stops there. ... So Mia knew Grossberg...

Leave it be







Phoenix:
I don't think it has much to do with the current case. I'd be interested to know what it contains... but I'll leave it alone for now.

File "J-S"







Phoenix:
Let's see... "J" through "S"... Nothing much in here. Maybe I'll just skim some of this?



Skim







Phoenix:
*sigh* Well, no harm in flipping through a bit, I guess... The biggest part's here at the end in "S"... "Suicide"? Eww... She has a collection of suicide reports. There's politicians... policemen... ... ...! There's writing on most of these in pencil. "White"...? This is Mia's handwriting. Wait, I get it! Mia thought he was involved in these "suicides"! White drove them all to... ... I can use these newspaper clippings. Hmm... let's find the most disturbing one...

What's wrong? Is something stuck to my face? Why yes! There's my eyes, and my nose, and my mouth... But of course I jest. You need not restrain your mirth, my friend! It is okay to indulge in my cosmopolitan sense of humor. I will not think less of you.Present









Newspaper Clipping







Phoenix:
(This is the only clue that Mia left me... I'd better make this one count!) Mr. White... see this? It's an article describing the suicide of a politician.
White:
...
Phoenix:
He was embezzling secret government funds. Then, one day, word got leaked to the press. The very next day he took his own life.
White:
And this concerns me how...?
Phoenix:
I found this article in Mia's office.
White:
Miss Mia...?
Phoenix:
She had a file filled with articles like this. Every one of them was labeled with a single word... "White."
White:
...!
Phoenix:
Mr. White, I know what you did to this politician.



You bribed him







Phoenix:
You bribed him!
White:
B-bribed!? ... What exactly has led you to say this?
Phoenix:

White:
Hmph. You certainly have an active imagination.
Phoenix:
(Dammit!)

You spied on him







Phoenix:
You were spying on him, weren't you?
White:
"Spying"...?
Phoenix:
You snooped on him, and found out about the embezzlement. Then, when you revealed it, he was driven to suicide!
White:
Mr. Lawyer. I know nothing of this. And, even in the highly unlikely event that I did do such a thing... All I would have done is provide "information." That is not a crime in this country.
Phoenix:
(Gah! This guy's as cool as a cucumber...!)

You were blackmailing him!White:
Blackmail?Phoenix:
Not just him, either. You were threatening and coercing hundreds of others! You were involved in all of the suicide cases that Mia investigated! This company is built on blackmail! I'm right, aren't I?White:
What a bizarre accusation. Mr. Wrong... What is it that you should be doing now? Investigating me? No no no. I think not! You should be searching for the one who killed Miss Mia!Interphone:*beep*[Secretary's Office, hello?]White:
Mr. Wrong will be leaving now.Interphone:

How dare you!White:
I'll point the finger at you, and you will be tried as Miss Mia's killer! The case is as good as settled. No lawyer of any worth will defend you. I have friends in the local lawyer's association, you see. You'll be given a lawyer so stupendously inept that they make even you look competent.Phoenix:

Well... I guess this is it!Phoenix:
Yeah. One way or another, this case gets decided today.Maya:
Aaa! Ph-Phoenix! Look!Phoenix:
(...! Prosecutor... Edgeworth.)Edgeworth:
I received a call from the public prosecutor's office yesterday.Phoenix:
?Edgeworth:
He told me that whatever Mr. White says today, it will be the "absolute truth." No matter how you try to attack his testimony... If I raise an objection, I have it on good faith that the judge will listen to me.Phoenix:
(What, does White have the judge in his pocket, too!?) So... you're saying I'm going to be guilty. End of story?Edgeworth:
... I will do anything to get my verdict, Mr. Wright. Anything.Maya:
Why... Why!? How can you torment an innocent person like this!?Edgeworth:
"Innocent"...? How can we know that? The guilty will always lie, to avoid being found out. There's no way to tell who is guilty and who is innocent! All that I can hope to do is get every defendant declared "guilty"! So I make that my policy.Phoenix:
Edgeworth... You've changed.Maya:
Hmm? Phoenix! You know him!?Edgeworth:
Don't expect any special treatment, Phoenix Wright.Maya:
Ph-Phoenix...?Phoenix:
Well... court will be starting soon. (Changed from [Well... court will be opening for session soon.] in the original release)Maya:
What? But wait! Your defense attorney isn't even here yet! They're not... (Changed from [Your defense attorney isn't even here yet! He's not...] in the original release)Phoenix:

Whaaaat!?Phoenix:
Okay, let's do this.September 9, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 1Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Phoenix Wright.Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:
Mr. Wright... Are you sure you're up to doing this?Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. I will be defending myself.Judge:
Understood. Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth:
As the details of the event are already quite clear to the court, today we will hear the testimony of a witness to the defendant's crime. (Changed from [today we will hear the testimony of another witness to the defendant's crime.] in the original release)Judge:
I see. The prosecution may call its witness.Phoenix:
(That went far too smoothly! Why didn't the judge ask Edgeworth why his witness didn't testify before!? It's like... it's like he already knows why! Hmm. If anyone's going to raise an objection about this, I suppose it's me...)Objection







Phoenix:
Mr. Edgeworth, you owe an explanation to the court! Why didn't this witness testify in the trial against Ms. Maya Fey!?
Edgeworth:
Hmph. I'm ever so sorry! Mr. White is a busy man, and besides... at the time, I thought that Ms. May's opinion was all that would be needed. Again, my sincerest apologies to the court.
Judge:
Excellent, Mr. Edgeworth. I appreciate your demeanor.
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
(Great. He gets to show off and I get nowhere.)
Leads to:
"I would like to call Mr. Redd White to the stand!"Let it go







Phoenix:
(Forget it. I smell a trap.)
Leads to:
"I would like to call Mr. Redd White to the stand!"Edgeworth:
I would like to call Mr. Redd White to the stand!Edgeworth:
Please state your full name.White:
You wish to know the title of my personage?Edgeworth:
Er... your name?White:
Yes! That is what I said! Oh dear, do my locutions confuse?Edgeworth:
Name!Phoenix:
(These two are great together...)White:
My name is Redd White. But my friends call me Blanco Nino. I am the CEO, or to use a more common term, the President, of Bluecorp.Edgeworth:
Did you know the victim, Ms. Mia Fey?White:
That would be a negatory! No, I did not.Edgeworth:
... You were at the Gatewater Hotel the night of the murder?White:
Correct.Edgeworth:
And you witnessed the murder from there?White:
Ahem. Why tell you what you already know?Judge:
Very well, Mr. White. You may begin your testimony.Phoenix:
(If I can't rip this guy's testimony apart, I'm done for. Why do I always feel like it's the end of the world and I'm the last man standing?)White:
Ho hoh hoh. I hope you have made your peace with God, Mr. Lawyer!Phoenix:
...!Maya:
Let him have it, Phoenix!Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --White:
Let's see, it was about 9:00, I believe.
I was quietly perusifying... er, that's "reading" to you, some papers by the window.
Then I heard a bedlam coming from outside!
Surprised, I turned to look at the building across the way.
It was then I saw him: a spiky-haired man attacking a woman with long hair!
Needless to say that man was none other than you, Mr. Lawyer!
I called Miss May over at once. She, too, was flabbergasted of course.
The victim, she... she ran away, but you gave chase!
Finally there was a terrible impaction! Then it was all over...Judge:
Hmm... If things occurred as you testify, then I'm afraid the defendant is guilty. Very well, defendant... er, I mean, Mr. Wright. Your cross-examination...Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.Cross Examination-- Witness's Account --White:
Let's see, it was about 9:00, I believe.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
How do you know what time it was?
White:
Because I am always abso-posi-lutely perfect, you know?
Phoenix:
No no no, you're not getting away with that!
White:
You are so mistrusting, Mr. Lawyer! So... what was the proper term for "secretary" again...? Anyway, Miss May ordered room service for 9:00. It happened soon after the room service arrived.
Phoenix:
(Hmm. That's what Miss May said, too.)



Press further







Phoenix:
True, the bellboy who brought the coffee saw Miss May. But he testified that he did not see you at the time!
White:
Ahem. This is your concern? Silly Lawyer! Miss May received the coffee outside the room! Of course he could not see me. He would need X-ray vision to pull off something like that!
Phoenix:
(Hmm...)
Edgeworth:
Tell us, what were you doing at the time?
Leads back to cross-examination




Hold back







Phoenix:
(I don't see anything to gain by attacking him on this point any further.) Okay, what were you doing at the time?

I was quietly perusifying... er, that's "reading" to you, some papers by the window.Press

Phoenix:
By window, you mean the one directly across from the Fey & Co. Law Office?
White:
Correct! That is the only window, you see.
Phoenix:
And there you were reading... papers?

Correct! The Gatewater is a businessman's hotel, and I am a busy man who had business to do!White:
Then I heard a bedlam coming from outside!Press







Phoenix:

It must have been when you attacked, I assume.
Edgeworth:
We see. Continue.White:

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So you were reading your papers until you heard that sound?
White:
But of course. I am no snoop, peeping out of windows at night.

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
S-spiky-haired!?White:

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What you just said directly conflicts with Miss May's testimony! Miss May clearly stated that the assailant looked like a "girl"!
White:
I've always been proud of my eyesight, Mr. Lawyer.
Phoenix:
Just what is your eyesight?
White:
Counting both eyes... 40!
Phoenix:
40!? Don't add them together!
Judge:
I think the witness is trying to say his eyesight is good.
Phoenix:
(Hey, whose side is the judge on, anyway?)
Edgeworth:
And what did you do then?White:
I called Miss May over at once. She, too, was surprised of course.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What was Miss May doing at that time?
White:
She had just finished watching a soap opera on the TV, and was weeping openly.
Phoenix:
Did you know she had been tapping the Fey office phone?
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Irrelevant! That has nothing to do with the case at hand.
White:
I care not. I will answer the lawyer's bold inquiry. Miss May was acting alone when she tapped the phone of this Fey woman.
Phoenix:
You'd make a good politician, Mr. White.
White:
Ho hoh! After all, I am "El Presidente."

Wait right there! Mr. White, you've dug your own grave!White:
What is this!?Phoenix:
You said the victim ran to the "left." But that directly contradicts Miss May's testimony! She clearly stated that the victim ran "right"!White:
...! Oh hoh hoh. It is simple. You have misheard her.Phoenix:
I think not. Look at the floor plans... The killer was here. And the victim, here. If the victim ran to the left, as you claim she did... She would have been running directly away from the door! She would have been running into a dead end! Don't you find that odd?White:
! Very strange... I did see her run to the left... I did.Maya:
Phoenix... look at his face. I don't think he's lying about this one.Phoenix:
True. (Maybe he really did see the victim run left...? So he did witness the killing...? Wait a second!)Judge:
Mr. Wright?Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor?Judge:
Miss May says "right," and Mr. White says "left." Can you explain this contradiction to the court?Mr. White is right







Phoenix:
As Mr. White testified, Mia ran to the left.
Judge:
But... But if that's the case... Why would she run in the opposite direction from the door?
Phoenix:
She did not. She was running towards the door, Your Honor.
Edgeworth:
Bwah! Now you're the one making a contradiction, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Not at all.

"Obviously, the witness was not viewing the crime from the hotel!"Miss May is right







Phoenix:
As Miss May has stated, Mia ran to the right after she was attacked.

What is this? I am not fashioning fabrications, I assure you! That lady ran to the left! I am sure of it!

2025-01-22 14:43:35,819 - INFO - Assistant reply: To find a contradiction in the witness's testimony, let's examine each statement carefully:

1. "Umm, well, see--I looked at the other window when I heard that thing fall."
2. "Then, the next moment, I saw Miss Mia run to the left!"
3. "The killer, you, attacked her... but she dodged."
4. "She turned, and ran for the door!"
5. "Then you did her in with a single blow! Thwap!"

According to the autopsy, Mia died from a single blunt force trauma, with instant death, although it was later updated to say she may have lived a few minutes. This was consistent with not having time to write a name or run from attack to the door with facilitating factors or not.

1. Statement 2 and 4 are inconsistent with how the murder happened. Mia was stated to have been instantly struck down, not having run for the door or dodged an attack. 

2. Statement 5 is refuted by Mia’s updated autopsy report suggesting there would be no substantial activity after the first blow. The critical point is that according to witnesses and crime scene details, the attack did not unfold with Mia dodging and running.

Thus, this testimony contradicts the known evidence:

Conclusion: The contradiction is that White claims Mia ran to the left and was then struck with a single blow, but the autopsy report states that she was struck with a single fatal blow.

The correct evidence to present would then be "Mia's Autopsy Report" to the statement "Then you did her in with a single blow! Thwap!"

Mr. Payne?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nAs Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to the court just what that \"object\" was?Payne:\nThe murder weapon was this statue of \"The Thinker.\" It was found lying on the floor, next to the victim.Judge:\nI see... The court accepts it into evidence. (Changed from [I see... the court accepts it into evidence.] in the original release)Statue added to the Court Record.Mia:\nWright... Be sure to pay attention to any evidence added during the trial. That evidence is the only ammunition you have in court. [Touch the Court Record button / Use the R Button] to check the Court Record frequently.Judge:\nMr. Payne, the prosecution may call its first witness.Payne:\nThe prosecution calls the defendant, Mr. Butz, to the stand.Phoenix:\nUm, Chief, what do I do now?Mia:\nPay attention. You don't want to miss any information that might help your client's case. You'll get your chance to respond to the prosecution later, so be ready! Let's just hope he doesn't say anything... unfortunate.Phoenix:\n(Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... This could be bad.) (Changed from [Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... this could be bad.] in the original release)Payne:\nAhem. Mr. Butz. Is it not true that the victim had recently dumped you?Butz:\nHey, watch it buddy! We were great together! We were Romeo and Juliet, Cleopatra and Mark Anthony!Phoenix:\n(Um... didn't they all die?)Butz:\nI wasn't dumped! She just wasn't taking my phone calls. Or seeing me... Ever. WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?Payne:\nMr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by \"dumped.\" In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!Butz:\nWhaddya mean, \"one of them\"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!Payne:\nYour Honor, the victim's passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.Passport added to the Court Record.Judge:\nHmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.Butz:\nDude... no way...Payne:\nThe victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several \"Sugar Daddies.\"Butz:\nDaddies? Sugar?Payne:\nYes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.Butz:\nDuuude!Payne:\nWe can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?Mia:\nWright... I don't think you want him to answer that question.Phoenix:\n(Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)Wait and see what happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Might be better not to get involved in this one...)\nPayne:\nWell, Mr. Butz?\nButz:\nDude, no way! That cheatin' she-dog!\nLeads to:\n\"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!\"Stop him from answering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMy client had no idea the victim was seeing other men! That question is irrelevant to this case!\nPayne:\nOof! *wince*\nButz:\nDude! Nick! Whaddya mean, \"irrelevant\"!? That cheatin' she-dog!\nLeads to:\n\"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!\"Butz:\nI'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I'm going to get to the bottom of this!Judge:\nLet's continue with the trial, shall we?Payne:\nI believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.Judge:\nYes, quite.Phoenix:\n(Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)Payne:\nNext question! You went to the victim's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?Butz:\nGulp!Payne:\nWell, did you, or did you not?Butz:\nHeh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn't!Phoenix:\n(Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)Have him answer honestly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I know! I'll send him a signal...)\n\n(TELL THE TRUTH)\n\nButz:\nEr... Yeah! Yeah! I was there! I went!\nJudge:\nOrder! Well, Mr. Butz?\nButz:\nDude, chill! She wasn't home, man... So, like, I didn't see her.\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nYour Honor, the defendant is lying.\nJudge:\nLying?\nPayne:\nThe prosecution would like to call a witness who can prove Mr. Butz is lying.\nLeads to:\n\"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?\"Stop him from answering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I'll send him a signal...)\n\n(LIE LIKE A DOG)\n\nButz:\nUm, well, see, it's like this: I don't remember.\nPayne:\nYou \"don't remember\"? Well then, we'll just have to remind you!\nPhoenix:\n(I got a bad feeling about this...)\nPayne:\nWe have a witness that can prove he DID go to the victim's apartment that day!\nLeads to:\n\"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?\"Judge:\nWell, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?Payne:\nThe man who found the victim's body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw the defendant fleeing the scene of the crime!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.Payne:\nYes, Your Honor.Phoenix:\n(This is bad...)Payne:\nOn the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim's building. Please bring Mr. Frank Sahwit to the stand!Payne:\nMr. Sahwit, you sell newspaper subscriptions, is this correct?Sahwit:\nOh, oh yes! Newspapers, yes!Judge:\nMr. Sahwit, you may proceed with your testimony. Please tell the court what you saw on the day of the murder.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Sahwit:\nI was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.\nI thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.\nThinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.\nThen I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!\nI quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.\nI thought to call the police immediately!\nHowever, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.\nI went to a nearby park and found a public phone.\nI remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.\nThe man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Judge:\nHmm...Phoenix:\n(Larry! Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!)Judge:\nIncidentally, why wasn't the phone in the victim's apartment working?Payne:\nYour Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.Judge:\nAren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.Blackout Record added to the Court Record.Judge:\nNow, Mr. Wright...Phoenix:\nYes! Er... yes, Your Honor?Judge:\nYou may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:\nC-Cross-examination, Your Honor?Mia:\nAlright, Wright, this is it. The real deal!Phoenix:\nUh... what exactly am I supposed to do?Mia:\nWhy, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!Phoenix:\nLies! What?! He was lying!?Mia:\nYour client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?Phoenix:\n!!! How do I prove he's not?Mia:\nYou hold the key! It's in the evidence! Compare the witness's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there! First, find contradictions between the Court Record and the witness's testimony. Then, once you've found the contradicting evidence... present it and rub it in the witness's face!Phoenix:\nUm... okay.Mia:\nOpen the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab], then point out contradictions in the testimony!

Question:

During the cross-examination, identify the contradiction in the witness's testimony by presenting the appropriate evidence at the correct statement.
In this example, the witness claims to remember the time exactly as 1:00 PM, but the Cindy's Autopsy Report records the time of death between 4 PM-5 PM. This discrepancy can be presented as evidence to contradict the witness's statement.

Answer:
{
  "action": "present",
  "testimony": 9,
  "evidence": 2
}You may now present evidence that is helpful in finding a contradiction in the testimony. To present evidence, answer the question with a JSON object in the format of {"action": "present", "testimony": <number of the testimony>, "evidence": <number of the evidence>}, for example {"action": "present", "testimony": 5, "evidence": 2}.
Note that the evidence, character, and testimony is listed from 0 to n-1, so your response should be 0-indexed.
Explain your reasoning step by step before providing the JSON object. 
 Conclude your answer with "Final Answer:" followed by the JSON object on a new line.
Do not write any things after the JSON and make sure you use "Final Answer:" followed by the JSON object.

That's good to hear. Actually, I'm calling because I have a favor to ask.???:
I know, I know. You want me to hold evidence for you?Mia:
Sharp as always! There's a lot of buzz about the upcoming trial... I just don't feel safe keeping the evidence here.???:
I gotcha. So, what is it this time?Mia:
It's... a clock.???:
A clock?Mia:
Yeah, it's made to look like that statue, "The Thinker." And it tells you the time! I thought you might like it. You always liked toys.???:
Hey! I'm not a little girl anymore, Sis!Mia:
Now, now. You know I'm only teasing. Ah, I should probably tell you, the clock isn't talking right now.???:
Huh? It's not working? That's lame!Mia:
I had to take the clockwork out. Sorry. I put some papers inside it instead.???:
Papers? Is that the evidence, then? Hmm, well... there's a possibility that it might turn out that way, yes.Mia:
Can you come by the office tonight, say 9:00, to pick it up? I'll be in a pretrial meeting until then.???:
Okay, Sis, but I expect dinner! Something good! Like... burgers! I could really go for a good burger.Mia:
Okay, okay. We'll hit the usual joint.???:

Miss Fey, you are a poor liar. Why, I see it right over there... That must be "The Thinker" that swallowed those papers.Mia:

Anywhere







Phoenix:
I smell blood... and that can't be good! I have to check and see if Mia... the Chief's okay!Phoenix:
That smell... Blood!???:
... *sob* Sis...Phoenix:
(Someone's there!) ...! Chief? Chief...?Chief!!!Phoenix:
Who are you????:
...Phoenix:
(The strange girl dropped out cold. I left her lying on the office sofa. I went back to the chief where she lay under the window. Her body was still warm... I could feel it when I held her shoulder. Then, all too quickly, it began to fade... Until finally she was cold.)Phoenix:
Chief...Examine









Broken glass







Phoenix:
Some shards of glass are scattered on the floor. They seem to be the remains of a glass light stand.




Chair







Phoenix:
The chief's chair. A simple, functional design. Feels pretty good to sit in, too.




Mia Fey's body







Phoenix:
Chief... It's hard seeing her like this, but if there are any clues here... She was struck on the head with a blunt object. She probably died instantly. "The Thinker" lying next to her must have been the murder weapon.
The Thinker added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
Hmm... there are some glass shards near the chief's body. Must be pieces of the glass light stand lying broken in the back of the room.
Glass Shards added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
Nothing else that seems like a clue here... Hmm...? A piece of paper! It must have fallen from Mia's hand! What could it be?




Mia Fey's body (subsequent times)







Phoenix:
It's painful to look... but I have to, for Mia's sake. Looks like she was hit in the head with a blunt weapon. She probably died instantly.




"Maya" scrap of paper (after examining Mia Fey's body; before clearing all Talk options at Fey & Co. Law Offices)







Phoenix:
! A word is written in blood on this scrap of paper! "Maya"...? Did Mia write this? This piece of paper is a receipt from a department store, dated yesterday.
Receipt added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:

"The Thinker" statue







Phoenix:
It's encrusted with dried blood. How ironic that this became the murder weapon... again.




Window







Phoenix:
There's a large building right across from the office. The "Gatewater Hotel." A nice, luxurious place.




Bookshelf







Phoenix:
All the chief's important documents are packed in here. This is where she filed her case records and recent rulings.




Computer







Phoenix:
Surprisingly, the chief was never good with machines. About all she used this PC for was e-mail. She picked up this ancient model at some garage sale for practically nothing.




Desk







Phoenix:
A perfectly normal office desk. The chief had a very particular policy about office décor: "Spend big on stuff the clients use, but keep your own stuff simple."




Ledger book







Phoenix:
The Fey & Co. ledger book. Everything is written in the chief's ultra-neat handwriting. It's a small office, but it makes a good bit of money.




Corded phone







Phoenix:
Right! I'd better call the police! ...? That's funny... A few of the screws on the receiver are missing... It looks like someone was halfway through taking it apart.
???:
Police!? Please, come quick!
Phoenix:
(Wh-what was that!? Someone screaming from outside the window!?) ...! She's staring right at me! She's holding a phone in her hand...




Corded phone (subsequent times)

Bookshelf







Phoenix:
You couldn't cram more legal books in here, even if you wanted to. Few can gaze upon the shelves without feeling insignificant.




Door







Phoenix:
The door to the chief's office. It's slightly open. I'd better not touch the door knob.




Painting







Phoenix:
A large painting. I guess you'd call this "modern art." I, on the other hand, call it a mistake.




Reception desk







Phoenix:
The reception desk. I usually sit here.




Sofa







Phoenix:
This sofa is for clients. It's leather... a real luxury model.




Writing desk







Phoenix:
A small writing desk cluttered with office supplies.Talk









What happened







Phoenix:
(She seems to be in shock. I don't want to disturb her, but I have to know...) Um... excuse me? Can you tell me what happened?
Maya:
... I came in... The room was dark. And Sis... Sis...!
Phoenix:
(So she was already dead.)




You and the Chief







Phoenix:
So, you're the chief's...?
Maya:
Sister. I'm her younger sister.
Phoenix:
And you were here... visiting? This late at night?
Maya:
Yes. She said she wanted me to keep some evidence for her.
Phoenix:
Evidence...?
Maya:
Yes... I-it was that clock... It was "The Thinker."Present









The Thinker







Phoenix:
Um, about "The Thinker"...
Maya:
! The Th-Thinker... That was... Oh, Sis! *sob*
Phoenix:
(Hmm, probably shouldn't have asked her about the murder weapon...)




Glass Shards







Phoenix:
This was lying next to the chief.
Maya:
I know. I saw it there too. I thought they might be pieces of the light stand.
Phoenix:
Hmm. Maybe. (Never heard of a glass light stand before...)




Receipt (before examining corded phone in Office)







Phoenix:
Before Mia died, she wrote a message with her own blood. She wrote it on the back of this receipt.
Maya:
! Th-th-that's MY name! W-why!? Why would she write my name?
Phoenix:
Please, just calm down.
Maya:
W-why would Sis write my name?
Phoenix:
(Uh-oh. Now I've done it... I'd better hurry up and call the police!)

Case closed! You're coming down to the precinct, ma'am.Maya:
W-what?Phoenix:
Mia's younger sister, Maya, was arrested on the spot. I was taken in for questioning and didn't get out until the next morning. My eyes were heavy... but I couldn't sleep. I sat around, waiting for visiting hours to begin at the detention center. I had to talk to Maya as soon as possible.September 6, 9:07 AMDetention CenterVisitor's RoomPhoenix:
(Wow, they have poor Maya locked up like a criminal.)Maya:
Oh! It's you! The lawyer... G-good morning.Phoenix:
Good morning! (She looks so tired...)Maya:
Um... Are you going to be my attorney?Phoenix:
Well, that's what I wanted to talk to you about...It's up to you







Phoenix:
(I'd better give it to her straight...) It's up to you.
Maya:
Up... to me?
Phoenix:
Yes. I don't think this is something I should decide. After all, you're the one in trouble here.
Maya:
... They're never going to believe me... are they? Even you, when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it!
Leads to:
"Did I look at her like that?"Of course I will







Phoenix:
(First things first, I better get her cheered up...) Yeah, of course I will! Cheer up!
Maya:
R-really...?
Phoenix:
(Whoa! Did I say the wrong thing? She looks sadder now!) Um... what... what's wrong? You don't think I can do it?
Maya:
... No... no one could! Who would believe me? Even you, when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it!
Leads to:
"Did I look at her like that?"Sorry, not a chance







Phoenix:
(Maybe if I joke a bit she'll cheer up...) Hah hah! No way, Jose! Just kidding...
Maya:
... ... ...
Phoenix:
(Eh heh. Whoops. That didn't go so well.)
Maya:
...Heh...
Phoenix:
Huh? M-Maya...? Was that a... chuckle?
Maya:
What? N-no! ... It wasn't very believable, was it?
Phoenix:
(Not really...)
Maya:
I-I'm sorry! I just thought, since you'd made a joke... Please, don't mind me! You're doing just fine!
Phoenix:
(Who's trying to cheer up who here!?)
Maya:
... I knew it. No one will believe me.
Phoenix:
What?
Maya:
Even you-- when you found me in the office. You looked at me like I had done it!
Leads to:
"Did I look at her like that?"Phoenix:
(Did I look at her like that?) No, no! I never thought...Maya:
I-it's okay. I understand. ... And... I've also heard about you.Phoenix:
Heard...? Heard what about me?Maya:
I... was talking to my sister on the phone the other day...Mia:
"Today was my junior partner's first time in court."Maya:
Wow! Really? How'd that go?Mia:
"It was quite the scene! Honestly, I was on edge the whole time. It's been a while..."Maya:
Hah! So, he crashed and burned?Mia:
"...He's a genius. One of those 'strike fear into the hearts of evil' types... The only thing he's lacking is... experience."Maya:
Huh, sounds like it was fun! Well, I know who to go to if I ever get into trouble now!Mia:
"I don't know, Maya. I think you might want to wait... give him three more years. That is, unless you want to be found guilty."Maya:
That's what she said!Phoenix:
...Maya:
I-I'm sorry! I didn't mean to trouble you...Phoenix:
No, it's okay. It's true, I guess. But... at the same time, I can't just sit and watch! When I think of the person who did this to Mia...Maya:

Security camera







Phoenix:
Smile for the camera...

This guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch. A real pro, this guy.Talk









Maya







Phoenix:
There's something I've been wanting to ask you...
Maya:
Yes?
Phoenix:
What's with that outfit?
Maya:
Oh, this? This is what all acolytes wear. It's my uniform, you could say.
Phoenix:
A-acolytes? Like people in religious training? What is it you do?
Maya:
Oh! It's nothing strange, really! I'm a spirit medium. ...In training.
Phoenix:
A s-spirit medium!? (I'm pretty sure that qualifies as strange.)




The day of the crime







Phoenix:
Could you tell me about the day of the murder?
Maya:
Yes! Let's see... that morning, I got a call from my sister. She wanted me to hold onto a piece of evidence for an upcoming trial.
Phoenix:
Evidence?
Maya:
Yes. That clock shaped like "The Thinker."
Phoenix:
(The one Larry made...) How could that have been evidence in a case?
Maya:
Um, right, she said something about that... ... I remember! Do you want to hear it in her own voice?
Phoenix:
H-her own voice!?
Maya:
Yes. I'm pretty sure our conversation is on my cell phone.
Phoenix:
You recorded it!
Maya:
Yeah! I forgot how to delete those things.




The day of the crime (after clearing "Your cell phone" Talk option)







Phoenix:
Could you tell me about the day of the murder? Sorry... I know it must be hard.
Maya:
No, it's okay. All I've been doing the last few hours is talking about it. I've kind of gotten used to it... Let's see... that morning, I got a call from my sister. She wanted me to hold onto a piece of evidence for an upcoming trial.
Phoenix:
(That's "The Thinker" clock that Larry made. It practically qualifies as a serial murderer by now.) So then, when did you arrive at the office?
Maya:
It was right around 9:00. The lights were off and... I could smell blood. Th-then I found her. My sister...
Phoenix:
Thanks, Maya. That's all I need to hear for now.




Your cell phone (appears after "The day of the crime")







Phoenix:
So, you say you have a conversation with your sister on your cell phone? Let's hear it!
Maya:
Right! Oh! I just remembered: that detective took my cell phone. Sorry.
Phoenix:
Oh, right. (Of course...) Next time I see Detective Gumshoe I'll ask him for it.
Maya:
I'll write you a note so you don't forget, okay?
Phoenix:
Sure, thanks.
Maya's Memo added to the Court Record.




Your cell phone (subsequent times)







Phoenix:
So, you say you have a conversation with your sister on your cell phone? Let's hear it!
Maya:

Phoenix:
Oh, right. (Of course...) Next time I see Detective Gumshoe I'll ask him for it.
Maya:
I'll write you a note so you don't forget, okay?
Phoenix:
Sure, thanks.




Spirit mediums (appears after "Maya")







Phoenix:
So you're an acolyte. A, er, medium-in-training.
Maya:
That's right. The Fey family, especially the women, have always been very sensitive to the spirit world.
Phoenix:
Wait a second, you said the "Fey Family"? So, Mia was into this stuff too?
Maya:
Of course! She left the mountain to "follow her career," she said. Her powers were first-class, too!
Phoenix:
(I... I had no idea.) Hmm... Wait...!
Maya:
What?
Phoenix:
So, you're a real, honest-to-goodness spirit medium? With E.S.P. and all that?
Maya:
Yes. ...In training.
Phoenix:
Well, can't you contact Mia's spirit, then? We can just ask her who killed her!
Maya:
...! I-I'm sorry... I'm still in training. I couldn't do something on that level...
Phoenix:
(Hmm... I thought that would be too easy.)Present









The Thinker







Phoenix:
I wanted to ask you about the murder weapon...
Maya:
Poor Sis... *sniff*
Phoenix:
(Hmm. Better not ask her about this now.)




Glass Shards







Phoenix:
This was lying next to the chief's body...
Maya:
I saw that too. They said they thought these were pieces of a broken light stand.
Phoenix:
Yeah, that seems about right. (Though I'd never heard of a glass light stand before this...)




Receipt







Phoenix:
Remember that receipt?
Maya:
Y-you mean the one with my name on it?
Phoenix:
Any idea why she...
Maya:
Absolutely none! Um... Do you trust me?



I trust you







Phoenix:
I trust you.
Maya:
Why? Don't you think I did it, too?
Phoenix:
No, I don't. (It's just a hunch, but...)
Maya:
That detective thinks I did it.
Phoenix:
...
Leads back to Court Record




I don't trust you







Phoenix:
...
Maya:
I didn't think you'd believe me. You're just like the detective.
Phoenix:
I'm sorry... I don't like lying just to make people feel better. But it doesn't mean that I've decided you did it! (She seemed so lost at the crime scene.)
Leads back to Court Record





Maya's Memo







Phoenix:
I wanted to ask you about your cell phone...
Maya:
That detective took it when they brought me in.
Phoenix:
(So, Gumshoe took it... I'll have to try to get it back next time I see him...)




Anything else







Maya:
Sorry... I've never seen that before.After clearing all Talk options:Maya:
... Um...!Phoenix:
Huh? Something the matter?Maya:
Um... I was wondering, could I ask you a favor?Phoenix:
...?Maya:
This is the address of a famous lawyer. My sister gave me this a long time ago. She said if I was ever in trouble, I should call him. And, well, I'm in trouble. Do you think you could go ask him to represent me?Phoenix:
(Hmm...)Accept







Phoenix:
Sure, why not? I'll go ask.
Maya:
Thank you so much! I have no one else to turn to...
Phoenix:
...? Say, what about your parents...?
Maya:
... ... ...
Phoenix:
I... I see. Don't worry, leave it to me.
Maya:
Thank you! The trial's tomorrow... at 10:00.
Phoenix:
W-what!? Tomorrow!?
Maya:
Tomorrow.
Phoenix:
What if this guy refuses!?
Leads to:
"They told me that if I don't find one, the state will pick an attorney to defend me."Refuse







Phoenix:
I'm sorry... I think this is the kind of thing you should really do yourself.
Maya:
...You're right. ...
Phoenix:
Something wrong?
Maya:
Actually, I asked the police to contact him, and they tried calling a few times. Nobody could get a hold of him!
Phoenix:
They couldn't find him?
Maya:
I have no one left to ask!
Phoenix:
...? Say, what about your parents...?
Maya:
... ... ...
Phoenix:
O-okay! Don't worry, I'll go ask him for you.
Maya:
Y-you will? Thank you so much!
Phoenix:
I'm just worried what will happen if I can't find him.
Leads to:
"They told me that if I don't find one, the state will pick an attorney to defend me."Maya:
They told me that if I don't find one, the state will pick an attorney to defend me.Phoenix:

Bookshelf







Phoenix:
There's a horrendous amount of legal books here. Scarier still is that Mia probably read all of these.




Houseplant







Phoenix:
Mia's favorite potted plant. I remember it had this bizarre name no one could ever remember.
???:
"Cordyline stricta," pal!
Phoenix:
(Who was that!?)




Mia's desk







Phoenix:
Mia's desk. Perfectly clean, as always. The only thing it's missing is... Mia.




Movie poster







Phoenix:
An old movie poster. Apparently, this was the first movie that made Mia cry when she saw it. I'll have to check it out one of these days.




Window







Phoenix:
The sky is blue, and so am I... There's that hotel, right across the way.Talk









Mia







Phoenix:
About Ms. Fey... did you do an autopsy?
Gumshoe:
Hmm? You want to know the results, eh?
Phoenix:
...
Gumshoe:
Now don't you look at me like that, pal! It's no use! She might have been your boss, but that doesn't mean you get any special treatment. Alright, alright. You can see the report, but that's all!
Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.




Mia (subsequent times)







Phoenix:
So, Mia's death was instantaneous.
Gumshoe:
That's right, pal. She was... a beautiful person.
Phoenix:
You knew her, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Sure. All of us down at the precinct knew Ms. Fey. Much as it pains me to say this, she was a darn good lawyer. Hey, what are you looking at? I just got a little dust in my eye, that's all.




Maya







Phoenix:
Um, about Maya...
Gumshoe:
Yeah! I'm looking forward to the trial! Sorry, pal, but this is one trial you aren't going to win!
Phoenix:
W-why do you say that?
Gumshoe:
The city's put Prosecutor Edgeworth on the prosecution!
Phoenix:
(Edgeworth...)
Gumshoe:
I'm sure you know what that means, you being a lawyer and all.




Edgeworth (appears after "Maya")







Phoenix:
Prosecutor Edgeworth...
Gumshoe:
That's right, pal! Mr. Miles Edgeworth himself! Wait... you do know him, don't you!?



Of course I do!







Phoenix:
I know him. He's a feared prosecutor. He doesn't feel pain, he doesn't feel remorse. He won't stop until he gets his "guilty" verdict.
Gumshoe:
Aww, don't talk about him that way. You make him barely sound human! Still, I'm afraid this pretty much decides the case.
Phoenix:
(So, Edgeworth is on this one... He hasn't lost a case since he became prosecutor at the incredibly young age of 20. Of course, there are rumors of back-alley deals and forged evidence...)
Leads to:
"All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion."




Of course not!







Phoenix:
Never heard of him.
Gumshoe:
Whoa! And you call yourself a lawyer, pal!? About four years ago, this Edgeworth guy became a prosecutor at the age of 20! Everyone says he's a genius. Surprised you don't know him!
Phoenix:
(Of course I know him... I was just playing dumb. He's a cold, heartless machine who'll do anything to get a "guilty" verdict! There are rumors of back-alley deals and forged evidence...)
Leads to:
"All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion."


Phoenix:
(All I know for sure is that Edgeworth hates crime with an almost abnormal passion. I never imagined I'd be facing him so soon...)Present









The Thinker







Phoenix:
I was wondering, do you know anything about this?
Gumshoe:
That statue? That's the murder weapon.
Phoenix:
(Huh? He thinks the clock is just a statue, too... I'm starting to wish I'd never seen this thing.)




Glass Shards







Phoenix:
There was broken glass at the crime scene, right?
Gumshoe:
Hmm? Oh, that? Seems like a glass stand next to the victim fell over. The glass shards were pieces of the broken stand.




Receipt







Phoenix:
There was a piece of paper next to the victim, wasn't there?
Gumshoe:
Yeah. The one with the killer's name written on it!
Phoenix:
Are you sure that Mia wrote it herself?
Gumshoe:
Given the condition of the writing, it's hard to say if it's her handwriting or not.
Phoenix:
(So there's no proof that Mia wrote it.)




Maya's Memo







Phoenix:
I was wondering... did you see Maya Fey's cell phone?
Gumshoe:
Oh that? I have that.
Phoenix:
Do you think you could give it back?
Gumshoe:
Sure! I mean, wait a second, pal! Tricky lawyer!
Phoenix:
(Uh-oh, he's on to me!)



Tell him straight







Phoenix:
(Hmm... if I tell him why I want it there's no way he'll give it to me!)
Gumshoe:
Something the matter?
Phoenix:
Oh, no, it's just... You know, Detective!
Gumshoe:
Nope. I know nothing, pal!
Phoenix:
That cell phone has a lot of numbers on it... like her boyfriend's... A cell phone holds all a little girl's sweetest and spiciest secrets!
Gumshoe:
Urk? Y-you're trying to confuse me! Sorry, pal. I already checked all the numbers in memory!
Phoenix:
Impressive! You're quite the detective.
Gumshoe:
Uh huh. Oh, here, you can have the phone back. There weren't any suspicious call records in there, after all.
Leads to:
"Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation..."




Tell him not-so-straight







Phoenix:
(Okay, I can't be straight with this guy... but what should I tell him?)
Gumshoe:
Something the matter?
Phoenix:
Oh, no, um... T-that carrying strap on the cell phone...
Gumshoe:
This? Hmm... it says "The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo"... "The Steel Samurai"... that action hero on TV?
Phoenix:
Yeah, you see that strap is a collector's item... She... was worried it might get lost if it went down to the precinct.
Gumshoe:
That what she said?
Phoenix:
Um. Yes.
Gumshoe:
... Okay, pal. I wrote down all the numbers she called anyway. Here you go.
Leads to:
"Seems he didn't notice the recorded conversation..."

Mia's Autopsy Report







Phoenix:
Thanks for this!
Gumshoe:
Don't mention it, pal. When it comes to dealing with lawyers, "fight fair and square," is our motto!

Um, yes, thank you. I'll be heading out now.Gumshoe:
Oh, wait. One more thing I wanted to mention to you. I don't suppose you're planning on talking to that witness. Anyway, you'd better not! No influencing the witness with your lawyerly ways, pal!Phoenix:

Yeah, Miss April May. I'm sorry 'bout this... But I can't tell you anything about her!Phoenix:
(Well, you just told me her name. Miss May, huh?) So you've sent her home already, then?Gumshoe:
Ahah! You're trying your lawyerly tricks on me now! She's not to go outside her room until the trial!Phoenix:
(So... she's still in the hotel across the way.) I guess I should know better than to try to get a detective to leak information.Gumshoe:

Bookshelf







Phoenix:
Expensive-looking mahogany bookshelves, filled with expensive-looking books. Hmm... funny... they don't look like they've ever been read.




Desk







Phoenix:
A solid mahogany desk. The wood's been polished to a deep luster.




Painting







Phoenix:
That painting has been bugging me ever since I stepped in here. The oil paint is so thick it's practically giving me a stuffed nose. I'm sure the price is nothing to sneeze at either, for that matter.




Potted plant







Phoenix:
An expensive potted plant. No idea what kind of plant it is, but it's probably the most expensive one available.




Table







Phoenix:
A table for clients. Hmm... an elegant ebony case, and if I'm not mistaken, that lighter's made of solid gold. Even I can tell someone here's got money to burn.Detention Center (after visitng Grossberg Law Offices, but before examining open drawer in Gatewater Hotel - Room 303)Maya:

Your family







Phoenix:
What about your family?
Maya:
I only had my sister. My father died when I was very young. And I don't know where my mother is.
Phoenix:
(Don't know...? So she could still be alive?)




Your mother (appears after "Your family")







Maya:
The women in my family have been mediums for generations. They say a lotta spiritual power runs in our blood. (Changed from [They say that E.S.P. runs in our blood.] in the original release) About fifteen years ago, our family was involved in an... incident. There was a man, and he... he... He ruined our mother's life.
Phoenix:
("Ruined"...?)
Maya:
After that, she disappeared. Several years after that, my sister announced she would "become a lawyer" and she left the mountain.
Phoenix:
... So, you live by yourself?
Maya:
Yes. I've gotten used to it. Oh, also... I had to become independent, or I would lose my powers! (Changed from [I had to become independent, or I would lose my E.S.P.!] in the original release)
Phoenix:
(I feel bad for her, all by herself up on that mountain...)




Your mother's enemy (appears after "Your mother")







Phoenix:
So, who was this man who, um, "ruined" your mother?
Maya:
About 15 years ago... there was an unusual murder case. It made quite a stir, everyone was talking about it, apparently. The police were running out of leads, and they were getting desperate...
Phoenix:
Wait... they didn't use a spirit medium, did they?
Maya:
The police convinced my mother to try to contact the victim.
Phoenix:
Wow... So, what happened?
Maya:
The case was solved... we thought.
Phoenix:
You "thought"...?
Maya:
The man my mother helped the police capture was innocent.
Phoenix:
...!
Maya:
The police's consultation with a medium had all been carried out in secret, of course. But... A man found out about it and leaked it to the press. He told all the papers that my mother was a fraud, and the media jumped on it big time. She... my mother... became the laughing stock of the nation.

I see.

Excuse me? White?

That was his name. My sister told me.

It was a few days later when I found out how the story ended. The result of the trial was in the newspaper. "Guilty." I'll probably never meet her again. Did I make the right choice? Will I ever know? Mia... if you can hear me, please, tell me! ...


Phoenix:
Not! I can't let that happen! I'm not leaving here until she takes me as her lawyer!

"I've made up my mind!"Phoenix:
I've made up my mind! I'm going to defend you whether you want me to or not!Maya:
! Why?Phoenix:
Why? Well...I can't abandon you







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
You aren't the culprit! Someone else is!
Maya:
H-how do you know?
Phoenix:
I, um, I have a hunch... (Given the evidence, it would be easy to assume that Maya was the killer. But there's something about this whole thing that smells... fishy. That witness's strange behavior... was that all an act? And the way that lawyer refused to help out Maya... But more than all that, she has no one left to help her! Nothing is more sad, or more lonely than that. I know... I've been there. A long, long time ago. Why did I become a lawyer in the first place...? Because someone has to look out for the people who have no one on their side.) Maya...
Leads to:
"I won't abandon you. You can count on me."I don't know why







Phoenix:
To be honest, I don't know.
Maya:
You don't know?
Phoenix:
(Is this girl sitting in front of me the killer? All the evidence seems to say "yes." But there's something about this whole thing that smells... fishy. That witness's strange behavior... was that all an act? And the way that lawyer refused to help out Maya... But more than all that, she has no one left to help her! Nothing is more sad, or more lonely than that. I know... I've been there. A long, long time ago. Why did I become a lawyer in the first place...? Because someone has to look out for the people who have no one on their side.) There's only one thing I know for certain.
Leads to:
"I won't abandon you. You can count on me."Phoenix:
I won't abandon you. You can count on me.Maya:
... That's so kind of you... *sniff*... ...Phoenix:
Well! Let's fight this one and get you out of here!Maya:
R-right! Thank you!Phoenix:
(Whew, she smiled at last. She looks like an entirely different person!) One last question... You are innocent, right?Maya:
Yes! And I trust you... So you trust me, too, okay?Phoenix:
It's a deal. (So, what next... There's something that's been bugging me... Just what was inside that strange woman's drawer? It was when I tried to look into the drawer that she got all defensive. There has to be something in there!)Gatewater HotelBellboy:
Good afternoon, sir!Phoenix:
Excuse me, you are...?Bellboy:
Ah, I beg your pardon, sir! I am the bellboy of this establishment, at your service, sir.Phoenix:
Oh, right.Bellboy:
I've just come up to deliver room service, sir.Phoenix:
Um... do you know where Miss May might be?Bellboy:
Ah. I believe our guest Miss May is currently using the, er, facilities...? If you've no need of anything, I'll be taking my leave. Please, stay as long as you like. Enjoy...Phoenix:
Yeah... Wait... no! Hey! ... (Why does it seem like every time I come here, I end up embarrassing myself? Wait... now's my chance to snoop around a bit!)Bellboy:
Ah, I almost forgot!Phoenix:
Gah! Y-you came back quick!Bellboy:
Might I ask you to inform Miss May that there is a message for her? Please tell her that Mr. White, of Bluecorp phoned.Phoenix:
Oh, right. Sure. (Mr. White... of Bluecorp? Where have I heard that name?)Maya:
White... That was his name. My sister told me.Phoenix:

There is definitely something suspicious about this "Miss May"! Why would she have something like this in her hotel room? There's a story behind all this, I know it! Alright... I'll be using this bit of evidence in tomorrow's trial, that's for sure. For Maya's sake... I'll get to this woman's bottom! Wait... I mean ... you know what I mean.April:

Part 4September 7, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 1Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Ms. Maya Fey.Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor. (Miles Edgeworth... I'd better not show any signs of weakness today, or he'll be on me in an instant.)Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth. Please give the court your opening statement.Edgeworth:
Thank you, Your Honor. The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, was at the scene of the crime. The prosecution has evidence she committed this murder... and we have a witness who saw her do it. The prosecution sees no reason to doubt the facts of this case, Your Honor.Judge:
I see. Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Let's begin then.Edgeworth:
If we may call our first witness, Your Honor. (Changed from [You may call your first witness.] in the original release) The prosecution calls the chief officer at the scene, Detective Gumshoe!Edgeworth:
Witness, please state your name and profession to the court.Gumshoe:
Sir! My name's Dick Gumshoe, sir! I'm the detective in charge of homicides down at the precinct, sir!Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe. Please, describe for us the details of this murder.Gumshoe:
Very well, sir! Let me use this floor map of the office to explain. The body was found by this window, here.Edgeworth:
And the cause of death?Gumshoe:
Loss of blood due to being struck by a blunt object, sir! The murder weapon was a statue of "The Thinker" found next to the body, sir! It was heavy enough to be a deadly weapon, even in a girl's hands, sir!Judge:
The court accepts the statue as evidence.Phoenix:
(They're still calling it a "statue"...)Floor Plans added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:
Now, Detective...Gumshoe:
Y-yes sir!Edgeworth:
You immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey, who was found at the scene, correct? Can you tell me why?Gumshoe:
Yes sir! I had hard evidence she did it, sir!Judge:
Hmm. Detective Gumshoe. Please testify to the court about this "hard evidence."Witness Testimony-- Maya Fey's Arrest --Gumshoe:
As soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!
There were two people there already:
The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.
I immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey!
Why? We had a witness account describing her!
The witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder!Judge:
Hmm... The very moment, you say. Very well. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor. (Cross-examine what...? I couldn't see a single contradiction in that testimony...)...whoosh...SMACK!Phoenix:
(Hey! Maya just threw something at me... What's this? "When my sister couldn't find any contradictions in a witness's testimony she would bluff it and press the witness on every detail! The witness always slips up and says something wrong... It worked lots of times!" Heh... I should have expected Maya would know some of her sister's tricks! Alright. Let's give this a try!)Judge:
Something the matter?Phoenix:
No, Your Honor. I'd like to begin my cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Maya Fey's Arrest --Gumshoe:
As soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Who did you say you got a call from?
Gumshoe:
Hey pal, don't play dumb! You know who! The call was from a customer at the Gatewater Hotel, right across from the crime scene!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... okay, I pressed. Not sure it did much, though.) Right. Please continue.Gumshoe:
There were two people there already:Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe, how long would you say it took, between you receiving the call, and your arrival at the scene of the crime?
Gumshoe:
Hmm, right... I'd say it was about 3 minutes!
Phoenix:
Th-that's pretty fast!
Gumshoe:
Our motto this month is "quick response"! That's how I got there before the killer got away!
Edgeworth:
Indeed! So, tell us who the two people you found on the scene were.
Gumshoe:
Yes sir!Gumshoe:
The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Are you absolutely sure it was us?
Gumshoe:
Listen pal, your dumb act will only get you so far! With her funky hippie clothes and your spiky hair? You two stand out like... like suspicious people at a crime scene!
Phoenix:
(Well... he does have a point about her. She is pretty unmistakable. I should pick my points to press with a little more care...)Gumshoe:
I immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Why's that? What's your reason?Gumshoe:
Why? We had a witness account describing her!Press







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Hold on just one second!"Gumshoe:
The witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder!Press







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Hold on just one second!"Phoenix:
(I can't see a single contradiction in there! I'll just have to take Maya's advice and press him on anything suspicious!)Phoenix:
Hold on just one second!Gumshoe:
Y-yeah?Phoenix:
If I heard correctly... You said you arrested her because you had "hard evidence" she did it, correct?Gumshoe:
Huh? Did... did I say that? Me?Phoenix:
I heard you say it!Judge:
You did say it.Edgeworth:
You said it.Phoenix:
Exactly what about this suspicious woman in pink's claim was "hard evidence"!?Gumshoe:
Wh-what!? Miss May isn't suspicious, and she sure isn't pink, pal! W-well, I guess she is pink...Judge:
That's enough, Detective Gumshoe. Do you have any more solid proof other than her claims, Detective?Gumshoe:
Umm...Phoenix:
(Hmm! I guess pressing can have its advantages!)Gumshoe:
... Yes.Phoenix:
(Gah!)Gumshoe:
Sorry, I got the order of things mixed up in my testimony, Your Honor Sir! There was something I should have told you about first, Your Honor!Judge:
Very well, Detective. Let's hear your testimony again.Witness Testimony-- Hard Evidence --Gumshoe:
After securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.
I found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!
On it, the word "Maya" was written clearly in blood!
Lab test results showed that the blood was the victim's!
Also, there was blood found on the victim's finger!
Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!
How you like that? That's my "hard evidence"!Judge:
Hmm... Before we begin cross-examination, I have a question for you, Detective.Gumshoe:
Y-Your Honor?Judge:
Why didn't you testify about this vital piece of evidence the first time!?Gumshoe:
Ah... eh... I know. I'm real embarrassed I forgot about it, Your Honor Sir.Judge:
Try to be more careful! Very well, the defense may begin its cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Hard Evidence --Gumshoe:
After securing the suspect, I examined the scene of the crime with my own eyes.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
And did you find any evidence?
Gumshoe:
Now, now, don't jump the gun on me, pal. Just listen. I'm getting to the good part!
Phoenix:
(I got a bad feeling about this...)Gumshoe:
I found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Just because you found it next to the body doesn't mean the victim wrote it!
Gumshoe:
Ho hoh! Then who did write it, smarty-pants?
Phoenix:
Wh-who? Um...



The killer







Phoenix:
Th-the killer! Anyone can see that!
Gumshoe:
Hoh. You're saying the killer wrote her OWN name!? Buddy, please!
Phoenix:
She was framed!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Hold on. If that's the case, where's your evidence?
Phoenix:
Ah... (Urk!)
Edgeworth:
Hah! I guess that was a bit of a tall order for you. Those without evidence shouldn't open their mouths, Mr. Wright.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, pal!
Phoenix:
(Argh...!)
Leads to:
"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found."




Miss May







Phoenix:
Well... it could have been the witness, Miss May!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Hold on. The witness was in her hotel room, not the office. Try pulling the other leg, Mr. Wright!
Gumshoe:
Yeah, and while you're at it, pull mine too, pal!
Phoenix:
(Argh...!)
Leads to:
"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found."




I did







Phoenix:
It... it could have been me!
Gumshoe:
What! S-so it was you!
Phoenix:
No, no, no, I'm just saying it COULD have been me! Can you prove it wasn't?
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Hold on. So, you admit to this? You admit that you wrote the note?
Phoenix:
Uh...
Edgeworth:
Listen to me, Mr. Wright. This is a court of law, and I expect you to refrain from making thoughtless statements! Amateur!
Phoenix:
(...!)
Leads to:
"Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found."


Edgeworth:
Well, Detective? Tell us what was written on that memo you found.Present Mia's Autopsy Report







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Detective Gumshoe!"Gumshoe:
On it, the word "Maya" was written clearly in blood!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Do you have proof it was Mia who wrote that!?
Gumshoe:
Of course I do, pal!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh... he sounded pretty confident. This might not be good...)Present Mia's Autopsy Report







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Detective Gumshoe!"Gumshoe:
Lab test results showed that the blood was the victim's!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What kind of "tests" were these again?
Gumshoe:
Huh? What kind? Umm... well... I hear they take the, um, little bits in the blood, the... er... hemo... hemogl... Hermo... goblins... hobgob... Er...? Herma-goblin bobbin... I-I refuse to testify on this matter, sir! I'm no expert on blood tests!
Judge:
Yes, that was quite clear. You may continue with your testimony.
Gumshoe:
Th-thanks, pal. I mean Your Honor Sir.
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe.
Gumshoe:
Y-yeah?
Edgeworth:
I think you can expect a pleasant bonus in your next pay check.
Gumshoe:
Oh? Oh hoh hoh.
Phoenix:
(That was a mess...)
Gumshoe:
Right! Where was I?Present Mia's Autopsy Report







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Detective Gumshoe!"Gumshoe:
Also, there was blood found on the victim's finger!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
On which hand was the bloody finger, Detective?
Gumshoe:
The right hand!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... she WAS right handed...)
Gumshoe:
Hah hah hah! Nice try!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh... I guess it wasn't too hard to see what I was getting at there.)Present Mia's Autopsy Report







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Detective Gumshoe!"Gumshoe:
Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe! Do you get a lot of cases where the victim actually writes the killer's name?
Gumshoe:
Sure! It happens all the time in books and the movies!
Phoenix:
This isn't a movie, Detective.
Gumshoe:
Oof!
Phoenix:
Let's talk about reality, shall we?
Gumshoe:
Umm... I guess, I haven't heard of many cases... no.
Phoenix:
Don't you find it a little odd that the victim would write down a name? Especially the name of her own sister?
Gumshoe:
Ah, yeah, actually, you got a point, pal.
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Stop right there. The witness's opinion on the matter is irrelevant! The facts are clear: the victim wrote down the name of the accused... The victim told us the name of her killer!
Judge:
Order! Order!
Phoenix:
(That didn't go so well...)
Gumshoe:
Th-that's right! What he said!Present Mia's Autopsy Report







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Detective Gumshoe!"Phoenix:
(That's his whole testimony... Okay, there has to be a contradiction in there somewhere. Let's find it!)Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe! There's one thing I want you to clarify for me here. You say that the victim, Mia Fey, wrote this note. That she was accusing the defendant, Maya Fey? That's really what you're saying?Gumshoe:
Wh-what? This isn't one of those lawyer tricks, now, is it? Of course she wrote it! Who else could have!?Phoenix:
You have it backwards, Detective.Gumshoe:
B-backwards?Phoenix:
The victim is the only person who absolutely could NOT have written it! This is a report from your department, Detective. "Immediate death due to a blow from a blunt object." She died immediately!Gumshoe:
But...!Phoenix:
No "but"-ing your way out of this one, Detective!Judge:
Order! Order! The defense has a point. Someone who died immediately wouldn't have the time to write anything down.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright. I beg your pardon, but when exactly did you obtain that autopsy report?Phoenix:
Wh-when...!?The day of the murder







Phoenix:
I... I'm pretty sure it was the day of the murder.
Gumshoe:
You're wrong there, pal! We didn't write an autopsy report 'til the day after!
Phoenix:
Oh. Right.
Leads to:
"The prosecution's point being...?"The day after the murder







Phoenix:
It was the day after the murder...
Leads to:
"The prosecution's point being...?"I forget







Phoenix:
I'm... sorry, I forgot.
Edgeworth:
Hah! Forgot, you say?
Gumshoe:
It was the day after the murder, Your Honor Sir. I was the one who handed it to him myself! Personally!
Phoenix:
Oh. R-right.
Leads to:
"The prosecution's point being...?"Judge:
The prosecution's point being...?Edgeworth:
That autopsy report is outdated, Your Honor.Phoenix:
Wh-what!?Edgeworth:
A second autopsy was performed yesterday, at my request! "Death was almost immediate due to a blow from a blunt object... But there is a possibility the victim lived for several minutes after the blow." I received these results this morning.Phoenix:
N-no way!Edgeworth:
Your Honor! It's quite easy to imagine that the victim did have time to write "Maya"! That is all.Judge:
I see!Phoenix:
(Damn you, Edgeworth! I should have known you'd have something up your sleeve!)Edgeworth:
Why, Mr. Wright, you look shocked! Something you want to say?You're a sham, Edgeworth!







Phoenix:
Mr. Edgeworth... I've heard there's nothing you won't do to get your verdict... What reason could you possibly have had to request a second autopsy report?
Judge:
Mr. Wright! The defense will refrain from personal attacks on the prosecution!
Edgeworth:
No matter, Your Honor... Mr. Wright. Say what you will, the evidence in this report is undeniable.
Leads to:
"Your Honor, I submit this report to the court."The detective's a sham!







Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe! You're a sham! How could you give me a faulty report!?
Gumshoe:
Huh? I-I thought...
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe.
Gumshoe:
Urp!
Edgeworth:
I'm disappointed in you, handing him the wrong report like that.
Gumshoe:
Eh...? I... I'm sorry, sir.
Edgeworth:
You are at fault, Detective. This isn't going to look good on your evaluation next month.
Gumshoe:
W-what? B-but... *sigh*
Leads to:
"Your Honor, I submit this report to the court."I'm a sham!







Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe. Are you calling me a fool because I believed your report?
Gumshoe:
Huh? Me? I-I'm not... huh?
Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe.
Gumshoe:
Urp!
Edgeworth:
I'm disappointed in you, handing him the wrong report like that.
Gumshoe:
Eh...? I... I'm sorry, sir.
Edgeworth:
You are at fault, Detective. This isn't going to look good on your evaluation next month.
Gumshoe:
W-what? B-but... *sigh*
Leads to:
"Your Honor, I submit this report to the court."Edgeworth:
Your Honor, I submit this report to the court.Judge:
U-understood. The court accepts the evidence.Autopsy Report updated in the Court Record.Edgeworth:
Well, Your Honor? The evidence strongly suggests the victim was identifying the killer.Judge:
I suppose that's the obvious conclusion, yes.Phoenix:
(Darn! This isn't good!)Edgeworth:
The prosecution would like to call its next witness. This poor, innocent girl saw the murder with her own eyes!Judge:
Let the witness Miss April May take the stand.Phoenix:
(Exactly what part of her is "innocent"...?)Edgeworth:
Witness, your name, please.April:
April May! At your service! *wink*Judge:
Order! An introduction should not require any reaction from the crowd! The witness will refrain from wanton winking! ([wanton] misspelled as [wonton] in the original release)April:
Aww... Yes, Your Honor.Phoenix:
(This is not good... She's already captured the heart of every man in the court!)Edgeworth:
Tell us, where were you on the night of September 5, when the murder occurred?April:
Um... gee... I was, like, in my hotel room? Tee hee. I checked in right after lunch.Edgeworth:
And this hotel is directly across from the Fey & Co. Law Offices?April:
Mmm... that's right, big boy.Judge:
Please testify to the court about what you saw.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --April:
It was, like, 9:00 at night. I looked out the window, y'know!
And then, oooh! I saw a woman with long hair being attacked!
The one attacking her was the mousey girl sitting in the defendant's chair!
Then the woman, like, dodged to one side and ran away!
But that girl, she caught up to her and... and... She hit her!
Then the woman with long hair...
She kinda... slumped.
The end. That's all I saw. Every little bitsy witsy! *wink*Judge:
Hmm...Edgeworth:
Well, Your Honor?Judge:
I see. It is a remarkably solid testimony. I don't see a need to trouble the witness any...Phoenix:
W-wait, Your Honor!Judge:
Yes, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:
What about my cross-examination!?Judge:
I thought the witness's testimony just now was quite... firm. Didn't you?Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright... I understand you were Ms. Mia Fey's understudy, were you not? You must know her techniques well. Her cowardly way of finding tiny faults in perfectly good testimonies...Phoenix:
H-hey! How dare you!Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? Will you cross-examine the witness?Yes, I'm doing it







Phoenix:
I'll gladly proceed with the cross-examination. (If only because I have a feeling Edgeworth doesn't want me to! She has to have some weakness!)
Leads to:
"Very well, you may begin your cross-examination!"No thanks







Phoenix:
No... you're right. I guess there wouldn't be much point.
Edgeworth:
Heh heh heh. I'm glad you saw the error of your ways so soon! Your Honor. The prosecution rests its case!
Phoenix:
(Wh-what? That's it!?)
Judge:
Very well.
Phoenix:
W-wait! Hold on!
Judge:
Yes, Mr. Wright? Changed your mind? Will you cross-examine the witness?
Phoenix:
Yes yes yes! (I'd better, or I'll lose on the spot!)
Leads to:
"Very well, you may begin your cross-examination!"Judge:
Very well, you may begin your cross-examination!Cross Examination-- Witness's Account --April:
It was, like, 9:00 at night. I looked out the window, y'know!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Why did you do that?
April:
Huh? "Why"? Like, why what?
Phoenix:
Why did you look out the window? Were you expecting to see something?
April:
Oh, well, um... gee!
Phoenix:
(What? That's it? She can't get out of this question that easily!)
April:
I sort of, y'know. I had a feeling!
Phoenix:
(Well, I have a feeling she's trying to avoid the question! Maybe I should press a little harder on this one?)



Go for it







Phoenix:
(Let's see how far I can run with this...) Surely, you must have had a reason to look out your window at that time of night!
April:
I... oooh!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright! I will not have you badgering my witness!
Phoenix:
B-badgering?
Edgeworth:
You insist on needling her with these trivial questions. I really don't think it should be allowed.
(Yeah! Yeah! Stop him!)
(The poor girl!)
Judge:
Order! Mr. Wright, you have been warned.
Phoenix:
(Poor girl!? What about poor me!?)
Leads to:
"You looked out the window. What did you see next?"




Back down







Phoenix:
(If I go too deep, I might not come back out alive... I'll back off for now.)
Leads to:
"You looked out the window. What did you see next?"


Edgeworth:
You looked out the window. What did you see next?April:
And then, oooh! I saw a woman with long hair being attacked!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
The woman with long hair... that was Mia Fey?
April:
Um-hmm! Slender, sort of, well, some people might say pretty, if that's your thing.
Phoenix:
(Your... thing?)
Edgeworth:
And the person attacking her?April:
The one attacking her was the mousey girl sitting in the defendant's chair!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
How do you know she was the defendant?
April:
Huh? Well... y'know! S-she had a girlish physique. Women know these things. Look... I-I just know, okay?
Edgeworth:
There was only one person at the scene of the crime with a short, girlish figure. The testimony is bulletproof, Your Honor.
Phoenix:
(He's right...)



Yep, he's right







Phoenix:
(Her testimony certainly does make sense... And everyone in the court keeps siding with her. I'd better not press too hard on this one.)
Edgeworth:
So then, tell us what happened to the victim.

I question the testimony

"Hold on a minute! That testimony stinks!"April:
Then the woman, like, dodged to one side and ran away!Press







Phoenix:

She "dodged"? Dodged what!?
April:
Well... the attack!
Edgeworth:
Please, continue your testimony.April:

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
How did you know it was my client!?
April:
Huh? Well, I... gee! First of all, she had a girl's physique! And, and secondly, she was... she was small! Who else could it be but her!
Phoenix:
(She has a point...)



You're right







Phoenix:
(Her testimony certainly does make sense... And everyone in the court keeps siding with her. I'd better not press too hard on this one. Maybe I should just listen to the testimony again.)
Leads back to cross-examination




I question your testimony







Leads to:
"Hold on a minute! That testimony stinks!"Phoenix:
(Hmm... that's it? Nothing really jumps out as a contradiction... There's got to be something in there somewhere! Maybe I'd better just press her on the facts a bit!)Phoenix:
Hold on a minute! That testimony stinks!April:
W-what!?Phoenix:
Miss May, I'm willing to bet that...You saw nothing







Phoenix:
Did you really see the defendant at all!?
Leads to:
"Urp!"You're lying







Phoenix:
Are you telling the truth? Did you really see the defendant!?
Leads to:
"Urp!"April:
Urp!Judge:
Mr. Wright! What's the meaning of this?April:
Yes, what is the meaning! Somebody tell me because I'm clueless! About this, I mean!Phoenix:
Okay... If you had really witnessed my client, Maya Fey... You would have noticed her clothes before noticing her physique!April:
...!Phoenix:
No one wears clothes like this on a daily basis! Except her! And I'm no expert on fashion, but her hairdo looks far from normal to me! However, the witness's testimony mentions neither of these things! The testimony is bogus!April:
But... but!Judge:
Still, we don't know if she was dressed that way the night of the murder...Phoenix:
She was, Your Honor! I saw her. And so did Detective Gumshoe! What do you say to that, Miss May?April:
Rowr! What are you trying to say, you mean lawyer! I-I saw what I saw. I... just didn't think all the trifling little details were necessary, darling.Judge:
Miss May. The court would like to remind you to please omit nothing in your testimony.April:
I'm sorry, Your Honor. I'll be a good girl. I promise. *wink*Judge:
Your testimony again, if you would.Phoenix:
(Damn, I almost had her!)Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --April:
I did see everything! I did!
The victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right.
Then the girl in the hippie clothes ran after her...
And she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did!
That... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? "The Thinker," I think?
Well? Does the accuracy of my report not startle you? Tee hee!Judge:
I... see. I only wish you had been so detailed from the beginning. Please begin the cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Witness's Account --April:
I did see everything! I did!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So, you saw me then, too?
April:
Of course! I'd remember that spiky hair anywhere!
Phoenix:
(Spiky...?)
Judge:
The witness will refrain from personal attacks on the defense attorney.
April:
Aww, was I a bad girl? I'm sowwy.
Judge:
Very well... continue.April:
The victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Is that "right" as in your right, as you looked from the hotel?
April:
Um... which hand do I hold my knife in again...? Right! It was my right hand! Right?
Edgeworth:
Satisfied, Mr. Wright? Please continue.April:
Then the girl in the hippie clothes ran after her...Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
How convenient for you to remember her "hippie" clothes!
April:
That's what you--I mean, that's what she was wearing! Oh, and her hair was all done up like a bun!
Phoenix:
(*sigh*...)
Judge:
What happened then?April:
And she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Where did this weapon come from?
April:
She picked it up from the desk!
Judge:
I see. What sort of weapon was it?April:
That... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? "The Thinker," I think?Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
A... clock? (Didn't this come up in another testimony recently...?)
April:
W-well? Don't look so sour, Mr. Lawyer. You can't win them all.
Phoenix:
(No... but I have a feeling I'm on to something now!)Present The Thinker







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Miss May."Phoenix:
(Her previous testimony must have been what Edgeworth wanted her to say... So this was the testimony in her own words...? Time to press and squeeze the truth out of her! Figuratively, of course.)Phoenix:
Miss May. What you said just now was quite... revealing.April:
Revealing? Oooh, you'd like that, wouldn't you. Naughty Mr. Lawyer...Phoenix:
You just said that this statue of "The Thinker" was a clock. But there's no way of knowing that just by looking at it!April:
Urp!Phoenix:
Another person in much the same position as you recently called this a "clock," too... And he was found guilty... of murder!Judge:
Order! Order!Phoenix:
Miss May. Can you explain how you know this was a clock?April:
Oooh... urp!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
The witness saw the murder with her own eyes! That's all that's important here! The defense is trying to confuse the issue with trivial concerns!Judge:
Yes... yes, of course. You will withdraw your question, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:Phoenix:
But questions are all I have, Your Honor! And as you may recall, I've caught murderers with these questions before! (Well, only once...)Judge:
... ... Objection sustained. You may continue to question the witness.Phoenix:
(Whew, that was close. If he stopped me there, the trial would be over!)April:
Huh? What? So... what happens now?Phoenix:
What happens now is you answer my question! How did you know it was a clock?April:
What...! Th-that's... ...Because... I heard it? Yes! I heard it say the time!Phoenix:
So, you've been to the law offices of Fey & Co.!April:
N-n-no! Hey, I didn't say that! Why would I go there! I heard from my hotel room. Hee hee!Edgeworth:
The law offices of Fey & Co., where the murder took place, are very close to the hotel. She could easily have heard the clock!Judge:
Hmm. Well, Mr. Wright? Are you satisfied?Phoenix:
No, Your Honor! (I can't give up now!) I'm not satisfied because...She couldn't have heard it







Phoenix:
You were at the hotel! There's no way you could have heard a clock go off in the building next door!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
You have proof that she could not?
Phoenix:
Uh...
Edgeworth:
Amateurs, amateurs. Listen to me, Mr. Wright. In the courtroom, proof is everything. Without it, you have nothing. You ARE nothing.
Phoenix:
Then I would like to propose a test to see if she really could have heard...
Edgeworth:
The prosecution denies your request!
Phoenix:
Wh-what!? On what grounds?
Edgeworth:
This is a trivial matter with no direct bearing on the case at hand!
Judge:
Indeed. Objection sustained.
Phoenix:
(Damn! Time to switch directions... quick!)
Judge:
Ready to proceed, Mr. Wright?
Leads back to:
"No, Your Honor!"It couldn't have rung







Leads to:
"Your Honor, members of the court..."Phoenix:
Your Honor, members of the court... It is inconceivable that the clock in question rang!It's empty







Phoenix:
That clock is missing its clockwork!
Judge:
H-how could you possibly...?
Phoenix:
Just have a look... Right now! (Changed from [Just have a look... As soon as you can!] in the original release)
Judge:
... Oh!
Phoenix:
See anything interesting, Your Honor?
Judge:
It is as the defense says!
Leads to:
"This clock is missing its clockwork!"It's broken







Phoenix:
I-I think it's broken! That clock's busted!
Judge:
You "think"?
Phoenix:
J-just look at it! Your Honor, please examine the clock!
Judge:
Hmm... Oh!
Phoenix:
See anything interesting, Your Honor?
Judge:
Well, I'm not sure I would call this "broken," but I doubt it could ring...!
Leads to:
"This clock is missing its clockwork!"The batteries are dead







Phoenix:
The batteries on that clock must be dead!
Judge:
"Must be," Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Your Honor, if you would inspect the clock...!
Judge:
Hmm... very well. ... Oh!
Phoenix:
Well, Your Honor? Are they...?
Judge:
This clock has graver problems than dead batteries!
Leads to:
"This clock is missing its clockwork!"Judge:
This clock is missing its clockwork! It's quite empty! Mr. Wright! Would you care to explain to the court the meaning of this?Phoenix:
It is as you can see. The "clock" was empty. It couldn't have rung! Therefore, this witness... is a big, fat liar!April:
F-fat!?Phoenix:
Well, Miss May?Edgeworth:
Tsk tsk.Phoenix:
?Edgeworth:
Quite a show you've put on for us, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:
(He knew the clock was empty! Somehow... he knew!)Edgeworth:
I'm afraid you've forgotten one thing, however. Indeed, the clock is empty. As you say... it can't ring. However, we must ask: when was the clockwork removed? If it was after the witness heard the clock, then there is no contradiction!Judge:
! Hmm! That's true. That is a possibility. The clock might have been emptied after she heard it.Edgeworth:
And that is exactly what happened, Your Honor!Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? Can you prove when the clockwork was removed?Edgeworth:
Ho hoh! Impossible, of course...Phoenix:
I have proof.Edgeworth:
W-what!?Phoenix:
Wasn't it you who told me "proof is everything"? Well, I was listening. And now I'll show you the "proof" you like so much! The evidence that proves when the clockwork was removed is...Present Maya's Cell Phone







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Take a look at this!"Present anything else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What do you say to that?
April:
W-what? I don't rightly understand what that's supposed to mean!
Judge:
I don't rightly understand either.
Edgeworth:
Ho hoh!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh... I think I blew it.)
Judge:
Mr. Wright, please refrain from flippant presentations of evidence in the future.
Phoenix:
S-sorry, Your Honor!
Leads back to:
"The evidence that proves when the clockwork was removed is..."Phoenix:
Take a look at this!Judge:
Hmm. That's a very cute cell phone.April:
Ooh hoo! You have a girlie phone!Phoenix:
W-wait! Wait! This isn't my phone! Listen! This is the defendant's cell phone, and it contains a recording... A recording of a conversation she had with the victim on the day of the murder!Judge:
Order! Order!Edgeworth:
The defendant's cell phone!? Th-this wasn't brought to my attention!Phoenix:
Perhaps Detective Gumshoe overlooked it?Edgeworth:
*grumble* (The good detective better remember he's up for evaluation soon...)Phoenix:
(I gotta say, I'm starting to feel bad for the big fella.) (Changed from [My heart goes out to you, Edgeworth. Not.] in the original release) Let's hear the conversation.Cellular:*beep*...Maya:
[So you just want me to hold on to "The Thinker" for you, then?]Mia:
[If you could. Ah... I should probably tell you, the clock isn't talking right now.]Maya:
[Huh? It's not working? That's lame!]Mia:
[I had to take the clockwork out, sorry.]...[September 5, 9:27 AM]Cellular:*beep*Phoenix:
Your Honor, I think this makes it clear the clockwork was already gone by the time this was recorded, (Changed from [I think this recording makes it clear that the clockwork was already gone...] in the original release) which was well before the witness even arrived at her hotel! (Changed from [and this was recorded in the morning, before the witness even arrived at her hotel!] in the original release)April:
Muh... muh... muh!?Phoenix:
Well, Miss May? Would you care to explain this to the court? Just how did you know that weapon was a clock!?April:
... W-well...! Well, isn't it o-obvious? I saw that clock before! Um... what store was that again? I-I go to so many! Oops! I forgot! *wink*Judge:
So the witness had seen it before. That would make sense. Does the defense have any objections, Mr. Wright?Yes







Leads to:
"The witness claims she had "seen it before.""No







Phoenix:
Oh right... well, if she had seen it before, I guess... (Wait a second!)
Judge:
Then, the court would like--
Phoenix:
Hold on! P-please wait, Your Honor!
Judge:
Y-yes...? So you do have an objection?
Phoenix:
Um, yes, well...
Judge:
Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Sorry, Your Honor, it's just...
Leads to:
"The witness claims she had "seen it before.""Phoenix:
The witness claims she had "seen it before." But this directly contradicts a piece of evidence already submitted to this court!Judge:
Well then, let's see it. Please produce this evidence that will prove the witness had not seen the clock before.Present The Thinker







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"It's simple."Present anything else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Here is undeniable proof!
Edgeworth:
Hah!? Please, this is a court case, not some surrealist performance art piece!
Judge:
Hmm... Perhaps the defense would like to change its mind?
Leads back to:
"Please produce this evidence that will prove the witness had not seen the clock before."Phoenix:
It's simple. This clock was never in any store, ever!April:
W-whaaat!?Phoenix:
A friend of mine made that clock. Only two exist in the world. And the one that isn't here is in police custody!April:
I-impossible! Everything is sold in stores!Phoenix:
Miss May, I think it's high time you went shopping for a better excuse...?April:
Mmpf...Phoenix:
Oh? Excuses not on sale today?April:
Oooh? Oh ho ho. Mmmrrrrph! Ooooorrrrrrr ggggghhhhhhh... hhh!!! What's it to you, porcupine-head!? That stupid clock doesn't matter, okay!? She did it! And she should die for it! Die!Judge:
W-w-whoa! Let's not get ahead of ourselves. T-this is a court of law, and the witness will remain calm!April:
Hrrrgh... hrrrh... Hrrr... heh. Oh? Oh! Oh? Oh hoh ho! S-silly me! *grunt* Did I, um, like... lose it? I guess I did. Tee hee! *wink*Phoenix:
(S-scary...)Judge:
Miss May, let me ask. Tell me, how did you know the weapon was a clock?April:
...Judge:
Hmm... oh dear. Does the defense have an opinion on this... behavior?Phoenix:
(Okay, this is it!) Yes, Your Honor. Allow me to explain how I see the truth of the matter. Miss April May, you knew the weapon was a clock because...You held it







Phoenix:
(This is familiar territory. I'll just use the same approach as with Larry.) Miss May held that very clock in her hands!
Judge:
Mr. Wright! When was this!?
Phoenix:
When she used it to strike the victim! When else?
Judge:
Order! Order! Mr. Wright! What is the meaning of this!?
Phoenix:
April May, you killed Mia Fey, I say! And when you struck, the force of the impact made "The Thinker" ring! That's when you heard it!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
... Tsk tsk. You truly are a work of art, Mr. Phoenix Wright.
Phoenix:
W-what's that supposed to mean!?
Edgeworth:
It was you who just proved that "The Thinker" was empty!
Phoenix:
Oh... (Urk! Of course it wouldn't ring!)
Edgeworth:
What's more, the witness has a rock-solid alibi. Miss May? Perhaps you could explain to the poor, misguided Mr. Wright? You were in the hotel at the time of the murder.
Phoenix:
(S-she can't prove it! She did it!)
April:
It would be MY pleasure!
Phoenix:
N-no way!
April:
Yes way, Mr. Lawyer. Tee hee? Didn't the murder take place at 9:00 at night? Gee, that's the exact time I ordered some room service from the hotel bellboy!
Edgeworth:
Incidentally, the bellboy corroborates the witness's story. Ergo, she was not at the crime scene! Rock solid!
Judge:
Mr. Wright! You've just made a serious accusation to a perfectly innocent woman!
Phoenix:
S-sorry, Your Honor. (That... didn't go so well. But, if that's the case... Then how did she know "The Thinker" was a clock!? ... Wait!) Your Honor, I figured it out! There is one other way Miss April May could have known it was a clock! One way alone! And I have proof!
Judge:
Well... proof, you say? Then, the court will examine your proof, Mr. Wright. How did the witness know "The Thinker" was a clock?

Phoenix:
Have a look at this.
April:
Ah! Oooh! Th-that!? Eh heh...
Phoenix:
I found this in Miss May's room.
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Please explain to the court what this is!
Phoenix:
Miss April May! You used a wiretap to listen to this conversation! That's how you knew "The Thinker" was a clock! Am I wrong!?
April:
I... I...
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Your Honor, this is ridiculous!
Phoenix:
Your Honor, look at the witness's face? Does she seem amused to you!? The defense demands an answer.
April:
La... laaa... lrrrrgf!
Judge:
Witness, answer the question. Did you tap her phone?
April:
...
Judge:
Miss May!
April:
Shut up, all of you! What gives you the right to talk to ME like that! You... you LAWYER!
......
April:
I-it's no fair! All of you g-ganging up on me like that... Oh, so I'm the bad girl, is that it? Is that it!? Uh... uh... uwaaaaaaah!
Phoenix:
(That did it! The court's seen the real Miss April May now! Now to deal the final blow!)



You did it, didn't you?







Phoenix:
Miss May, confess. You did it, didn't you?
April:
Are you out of your mind!? Oh wait, I forgot... you're a lawyer! You must be! At the time of the murder... I was in my hotel room, getting room service! How could I have killed her? If you don't believe me, just ask the bellboy!
Leads to:
"Well, does the defense have anything to say?"




Why the wiretap?







Phoenix:
Miss May... Why did you tap her phone?
April:
...
Phoenix:
Answer the question!
April:
Do I have to? Isn't this a murder trial? Isn't tippity-tapping er... irrelevant?
Phoenix:
(Gah! She's saying exactly what Edgeworth wants her to say.) Miss May. You were tapping the victim's phone! I hardly call that "irrelevant"!
Judge:
While this court does not condone the defense's tone of voice, he has a point. (Changed from [While this court does not condone the defense's tone of speech, he has a point.] in the original release) Well, Miss May? Do you have an explanation for the court? Can you prove you had nothing to do with this murder, even though you tapped her phone?
April:
At the time of the murder... I was in my hotel room, getting room service! How could I have killed her? If you don't believe me, just ask the bellboy!

April:
Oooh. Oooooh!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Your Honor, This is irrelevant!
Judge:
I'm not entirely sure that it is. Objection overruled. It troubles me that our witness was in possession of a wiretap.
Edgeworth:
This is outrageous! Does the defense truly claim that the witness was tapping her phone?
Phoenix:
Absolutely!
Edgeworth:
Even if that was the case, (which it's not) you still have to prove one thing! Did the victim ever say that the weapon was a clock on the phone? Can you prove that? I THINK NOT!
Phoenix:
Oh yeah? I THINK I CAN! It's simple!
Edgeworth:
WHAAAAT!?
Phoenix:
Here's my proof. The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is...

That's not going to prove anything, Mr. Wright. I think...
Phoenix:
W-wait! That was just a warm up!
Judge:
Hmm! Okay, once again. And I expect real proof this time!
Leads back to:
"The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is..."

This evidence reveals the truth of the matter!
Judge:
What does it reveal, exactly?
Edgeworth:
The mad delusions of the defense, perhaps?
Phoenix:
(Uh oh, bad reaction. Maybe that wasn't the thing...)
Judge:
I'm afraid it has revealed a certain over-eagerness... Let me ask again:
Leads back to:
"How did the witness know "The Thinker" was a clock?"You had heard about it







Phoenix:
The witness had never held the clock in her hand! However, she had heard that it was a clock!
Judge:
She "heard"...?
Phoenix:
That is correct, Your Honor. There is no other way she could have known "The Thinker" was a clock! And I can show you the proof!
Judge:
Well, this is interesting. Let's see it, then. Show me evidence proving that the witness had "heard" the murder weapon was a clock.

April:
What is it you little shrimp! Talk to me in that tone of voice will you!?
Phoenix:
You killed her, didn't you!
Judge:
Order! There will be order!
April:
What? How can you possibly say that!? Are you mad? A-all I did was a little wiretap... Oops!
Phoenix:
So you admit you tapped her phone!
April:
Heh... heh... hrrah! B-but wait! I didn't do ANYTHING bad like murder! I'm a good girl!
Phoenix:
Really? Can you prove it!? (No way can she prove it!)
April:
You think you're so smart, Mr. Lawyer... But I can prove it! And I will!
Phoenix:
You can't be serious! No way!
April:
Way, I say! Way! Oh, and I assure you I'm serious, Mr. Lawyer! Hmph! Okay? So, the killing happened around 9:00 at night? Why, that's just when I was getting room service from that sweet bellboy...
Phoenix:
R-room service!?
April:
Ice coffee, I believe it was? Ice coffee? You know? Like normal coffee, but COLD. If you don't drink it quick, the ice melts and then you have... regular cold coffee.
Phoenix:
I-ice coffee...!?
April:
Think I'm making this up? Ask the bellboy! *wink*
Edgeworth:
Ergo, the witness was not on the scene at the time of the murder!
Phoenix:
!
Judge:
So, where does that leave us...?
Edgeworth:
It is my great displeasure to inform you... That the witness appears to have been tapping the victim's telephone. However! That is a separate crime, with no bearing on the current case whatsoever! Her testimony stands! She saw the defendant, Maya Fey, commit murder!
Phoenix:
(No! They're going to let her just walk away! There's no way I can win this unless I tie Miss May to the murder somehow...)

Phoenix:
(Hah! I'd like to see her pull THAT off!)
April:
Mr. Lawyer, I saw that evil, evil grin! You were probably thinking "I'd like to see her pull THAT off," weren't you!
Phoenix:
(Damn... she's good!)
April:
Well you're not the first man who's thought that! And of course... I can, and will!
Phoenix:
You can't be serious! No way!
April:
Way, I say! Way! Oh, and I assure you I'm serious, Mr. Lawyer! Hmph! Okay? So, the killing happened around 9:00 at night? Why, that's just when I was getting room service from that sweet bellboy...
Phoenix:
R-room service!?
April:
Ice coffee, I believe it was? Ice coffee? You know? Like normal coffee, but COLD. If you don't drink it quick, the ice melts and then you have... regular cold coffee.
Phoenix:
I-ice coffee...!?
April:
Think I'm making this up? Ask the bellboy! *wink*
Edgeworth:
Ergo, the witness was not on the scene at the time of the murder!
Phoenix:
!
Judge:
So, where does that leave us...?
Edgeworth:
It is my great displeasure to inform you... That the witness appears to have been tapping the victim's telephone. However! That is a separate crime, with no bearing on the current case whatsoever! Her testimony stands! She saw the defendant, Maya Fey, commit murder!
Phoenix:
(No! They're going to let her just walk away! There's no way I can win this unless I tie Miss May to the murder somehow...)
Leads to:
"Well, does the defense have anything to say?"





Present Wiretap







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Have a look at this.
April:
Ah! Oooh! Th-that!? Eh heh...
Phoenix:
I found this in Miss May's room.
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Please explain to the court what this is!
Phoenix:
Miss April May? You were tapping the victim, Ms. Mia Fey's phone, were you not?
April:
Oooh. Oooooh!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Your Honor, This is irrelevant!
Judge:
I'm not entirely sure that it is. Objection overruled. It troubles me that our witness was in possession of a wiretap.
Edgeworth:
This is outrageous! Does the defense truly claim that the witness was tapping her phone?
Phoenix:
Absolutely!
Edgeworth:
Even if that was the case, (which it's not) you still have to prove one thing! Did the victim ever say that the weapon was a clock on the phone? Can you prove that? I THINK NOT!
Phoenix:
Oh yeah? I THINK I CAN! It's simple!
Edgeworth:
WHAAAAT!?
Phoenix:
Here's my proof. The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is...



Present Maya's Cell Phone







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"I present the defendant's cell phone."




Present anything else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
This! I think...
Judge:
That's not going to prove anything, Mr. Wright. I think...
Phoenix:
W-wait! That was just a warm up!
Judge:
Hmm! Okay, once again. And I expect real proof this time!
Leads back to:
"The proof that the victim said, on the phone, that the weapon was a clock is..."


Phoenix:
I present the defendant's cell phone.
Judge:
Yes, we've seen that.
Phoenix:
Listen once more to the conversation between the defendant and the victim.
Cellular:

*beep*
...

Maya:
[Mia! What's up? You haven't called in a while.]
Mia:
[Well, actually there's something I want you to hold on to for me.]
Maya:
[Again? What's it this time?]
Mia:
[It's... a clock. It's made to look like that statue, "The Thinker." And it tells you the time!]

...

Phoenix:
Miss April May! You used a wiretap to listen to this conversation! That's how you knew "The Thinker" was a clock! Am I wrong!?
April:
I... I...
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Your Honor, this is ridiculous!
Phoenix:
Your Honor, look at the witness's face? Does she seem amused to you!? The defense demands an answer.
April:
La... laaa... lrrrrgf!
Judge:
Witness, answer the question. Did you tap her phone?
April:
...
Judge:
Miss May!
April:
Shut up, all of you! What gives you the right to talk to ME like that! You... you LAWYER!
......
April:
I-it's no fair! All of you g-ganging up on me like that... Oh, so I'm the bad girl, is that it? Is that it!? Uh... uh... uwaaaaaaah!
Phoenix:
(That did it! The court's seen the real Miss April May now! Now to deal the final blow!)



You did it, didn't you?







Phoenix:
Miss May!
April:
What is it you little shrimp! Talk to me in that tone of voice will you!?
Phoenix:
You killed her, didn't you!
Judge:
Order! There will be order!
April:
What? How can you possibly say that!? Are you mad? A-all I did was a little wiretap... Oops!
Phoenix:
So you admit you tapped her phone!
April:
Heh... heh... hrrah! B-but wait! I didn't do ANYTHING bad like murder! I'm a good girl!
Phoenix:
Really? Can you prove it!? (No way can she prove it!)
April:
You think you're so smart, Mr. Lawyer... But I can prove it! And I will!
Phoenix:
You can't be serious! No way!
April:
Way, I say! Way! Oh, and I assure you I'm serious, Mr. Lawyer! Hmph! Okay? So, the killing happened around 9:00 at night? Why, that's just when I was getting room service from that sweet bellboy...

Leads to:
"Well, does the defense have anything to say?"




Why the wiretap?







Phoenix:
Why did you tap her phone?
April:
...
Phoenix:
Answer the question!
April:
Do I have to? Isn't this a murder trial? Isn't tippity-tapping er... irrelevant?
Phoenix:
(Gah! She's saying exactly what Edgeworth wants her to say.) Miss May. You were tapping the victim's phone! I hardly call that "irrelevant"!
Judge:
While this court does not condone the defense's tone of voice, he has a point. (Changed from [While this court does not condone the defense's tone of speech, he has a point.] in the original release) Well, Miss May? Do you have an explanation for the court? Can you prove you had nothing to do with this murder, even though you tapped her phone?

Present anything else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
This is my evidence!
Judge:
I'm afraid I'm not sure where you are going with all of this, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Um... "where"? Well, it's not so much a place as a... er...
Edgeworth:
Come to the end of your bluff, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
W-wait! Wait! That was, uh, practice! Here's the real evidence!
Judge:
Mr. Wright, this court does not condone the presentation of evidence for "practice." Let's see your evidence, for real this time, Mr. Wright.
Leads back to:
"Show me evidence proving that the witness had "heard" the murder weapon was a clock."Judge:
Well, does the defense have anything to say?Phoenix:
Um, well... (Come on, think of something!)Call the bellboy as a witness







Phoenix:
The defense would like to call the hotel bellboy as a witness! There's something suspicious there, and I'm going to get to the bottom of it!
April:
I think you've sunken quite low enough already.
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
I object to calling the bellboy!
Phoenix:
W-why? What's your reason?
Edgeworth:
Because I hold that the wiretapping had nothing to do with the killing!
Phoenix:
...!
Edgeworth:
However... If you agree to one condition, I'll consent to calling this witness.
Phoenix:
Condition...?
Edgeworth:
If Miss April May's alibi is not called into question after you examine the bellboy... Then you will recognize that Miss April May was not the killer, thus she is innocent! Therefore you must accept the verdict of "guilty" for Ms. Maya Fey! That is my condition.
Phoenix:
(What...!? I'd better find something suspicious in that bellboy's testimony... Otherwise Maya will be declared "guilty" on the spot! What should I do...?)



Accept the condition







Phoenix:
(Alright! I've got nothing to lose! Except for... well, everything!) Understood. I accept your condition.
Edgeworth:
Hmph. Fool... You fell right into my trap!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh!) Uh... um, wait...
Leads to:
"Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand!"




Give up







Phoenix:
(Grr! I can't accept those conditions!) Very well. The defense will refrain from calling the bellboy as a witness.
Judge:
I see. You may continue your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Right. On with the cross-examination.
Edgeworth:
What exactly do you have left to examine, Mr. Wright? Miss April May has admitted to the wiretap, yes. But that bears no relevance to the case at hand: murder! There's no way you can prove any connection!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh! Think! This can't be the end... but I'm out of evidence!)
Judge:
Then I believe the cross-examination is over. Mr. Edgeworth, does the prosecution have any other witnesses to call?
Edgeworth:
None, Your Honor. She's the last.
Phoenix:
(What!? B-but that means... Maya's guilty...!?) W-wait! Your Honor!
Judge:
Yes, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
The defense would like to call the bellboy after all!
Edgeworth:
... Tsk tsk tsk... As I thought!
Phoenix:
...?
Edgeworth:
May I remind you, dear Mr. Wright. Should you question the bellboy... and Miss April May's alibi prove to be solid... then, by default, your client Ms. Maya Fey will be pronounced "guilty"! Are you prepared to accept my condition?
Phoenix:
(Edgeworth... He's got me backed into a corner... But I don't see any other way to take this!) I accept!
Leads to:
"Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand!"Continue examining Miss May







Phoenix:
Right. On with the cross-examination.
Edgeworth:
What exactly do you have left to examine, Mr. Wright? Miss April May has admitted to the wiretap, yes. But that bears no relevance to the case at hand: murder! There's no way you can prove any connection!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh! Think! This can't be the end... but I'm out of evidence!)

Then I believe the cross-examination is over. Mr. Edgeworth, does the prosecution have any other witnesses to call?
Edgeworth:
None, Your Honor. She's the last.

Yes, Mr. Wright?

Leads to:
"Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand!"Judge:
Very well! The court calls the hotel bellboy to the stand!Edgeworth:
I believe we're ready for the witness to testify. He certainly does look like a bellboy.Bellboy:
Yes, sir. I received your summons in the middle of work, sir. I'm happy to be of service.Judge:
That tea set looks rather heavy, so without further ado, the witness may begin his testimony.Bellboy:
Very good, sir!Witness Testimony-- Miss May's Room Service --Bellboy:
I am the head bellboy at the fine Gatewater Hotel, in business for four generations!
I believe I received a call after 8:00 in the evening from our guest, Miss May.
She asked for an ice coffee to be brought to her at 9:00, on the dot, sir.
I brought it to her at precisely the requested time, of course.
And I delivered the ice coffee to our guest Miss May, herself.Judge:
I see. The defense may begin its cross-examination.Phoenix:
R-right! I'm ready. (I hope... This is it... If I can't prove Miss May was involved with the murder now... Maya will be finished!)Cross Examination-- Miss May's Room Service --Bellboy:

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What exactly is it you do at the hotel?
Bellboy:
Why, anything required of me, sir. I check in guests, I check out guests. I clean rooms, I make beds. I even deliver room service, sir. I checked Miss May in personally.
Phoenix:
Are you always so... so prim?
Judge:
Mr. Wright. You will refrain from asking frivolous questions...Bellboy:
I believe I received a call after 8:00 in the evening from our guest, Miss May.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Are you sure it was Miss May on the phone?
Bellboy:
Absolutely, sir.
Phoenix:
H-how can you be so certain!?
Bellboy:
I checked Miss May in personally, sir. Not only did I see her in all her stunning radiance, but I also heard her voice. And then I saw THEM, and I... Ahem. Er... ahem! The point being, I remembered her quite well, sir.
Judge:
Yes, what then?Bellboy:
She asked for an ice coffee to be brought to her at 9:00, on the dot, sir.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
9:00 "on the dot," you say?
Bellboy:
Yes. I confirmed that detail several times. She was watching a program on the TV, and wished to drink after she finished, sir.
Phoenix:
(9:00... the time of the murder!)Bellboy:
I brought it to her at precisely the requested time, of course.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
"Precisely" 9:00, then?
Bellboy:
Precisely, exactly, and most definitely, sir, 9:00 PM.
Phoenix:
How can you be so sure!?
Bellboy:
Miss May was quite insistent that it be brought then. "Oh, bellboy? Tee hee! I'd like, like, ice coffee at exactly 9:00!" Something like that, sir. Therefore, I knocked on her door at the crack of 9:00, sir.
Phoenix:
(Why would she be so particular about the time?)Bellboy:
And I delivered the ice coffee to our guest Miss May, herself.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
You are sure it was Miss April May herself?
Bellboy:
Ab-SO-lutely, sir.
Phoenix:
"Ab-SO-lutely"...?
Bellboy:
Yes, sir. As in, "so very absolutely," sir. It's an endearing mannerism of mine.
Phoenix:
How come you're so very certain!?
Bellboy:
Well, when I brought the room service, sir... S-she... the guest, sir, favored me w-with a, um, an "embrasser," sir.
Phoenix:
"Embrasser"!? Is that French for "embrace"?
Bellboy:
It's French for "kiss," sir. But not a french kiss, sir! More of a peck on the cheek.
Phoenix:
Wh-why would she have done that...?
Bellboy:
I believe, perhaps, she was momentarily swayed by my prim demeanor, sir. It was a moment I shall never, ever forget, sir.
Phoenix:
(Sounds pretty fishy to me... I think our Miss May was up to something and wanted the bellboy to remember her!)Phoenix:
(This bellboy wouldn't have any reason to lie... But I have to find something to use in his testimony! One more time. I'll press him until he spills the beans... or his tea!)After pressing fourth and fifth statements:Phoenix:
... It's no good! (There's nothing there! Is... is that it!?)Edgeworth:
Tsk tsk. Finally, you understand. This bellboy has absolutely no reason to lie! Now... If you have any decency, you will end this rather tedious cross-examination here!Judge:
Hmm. It was a bit tedious. The witness may leave the stand.Phoenix:
(I can't let this happen... can I?)Protest







Leads to:
"W-wait! Please wait!"Give up







Phoenix:
(No...! If I give up now, I lose everything... If I just give up the case, I'd be giving up the very reason I became a lawyer!)
Leads to:
"W-wait! Please wait!"Phoenix:
W-wait! Please wait!Judge:
Yes? Does the defense have something to add?Phoenix:
One last question... let me ask one last question!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
Your Honor, I must object. This charade of justice has gone on long enough!Judge:
Now, now, Mr. Edgeworth. Alright Mr. Wright. I'll give you one more question, that's all.Phoenix:
(Okay. This is really it, now. This is my last chance! What do I ask him about...!?)Check-in







Phoenix:
T-tell me about check-in! Tell me about when you checked-in Miss May.
Bellboy:
Oh, alright. Very well, sir. My first thought was that she was a beautiful, beautiful person. She's just my type of girl, so it was a disappointment, really.
Phoenix:
I see... ? Excuse me... what exactly was a "disappointment"?
Bellboy:
Well, I am not without charm, sir, but even I'd have little chance with her lover there.
Phoenix:
(...! What did he say!?) What did you say!?
Bellboy:
Ah! Oh... er... rather, quite!
Phoenix:
Bellboy! Tell us the truth now... Did Miss May check in with another person?
Edgeworth:

Leads to:
"I object! That was... objectionable!"Room service







Phoenix:
T-tell me again about er... room service!
Bellboy:
A-again, sir? At exactly 9:00, I delivered room service to Miss May in room 303. The guest had requested ice coffee... $18 was the charge, as I recall.
Phoenix:
I see... ...? E-eighteen dollars? Doesn't that seem a bit expensive?
Bellboy:
Y-yes, well, ice coffee for two, you know. And we don't skimp on the ice, sir.
Phoenix:
(...! What did he say!?) What did you say!?
Bellboy:
Ah! Oh... er... rather, quite!
Phoenix:
Bellboy! Tell us the truth now... Was someone else staying in Miss May's room?
Edgeworth:

Leads to:
"I object! That was... objectionable!"Bed making







Phoenix:
Bed... bed making! Tell me about making beds that day.
Edgeworth:
I was wondering what you were going to ask, but bed making? A new low!
Judge:
Now, now, Mr. Edgeworth. The witness will answer the defense's question.
Bellboy:
Yes, well, it was quite like any other day's bed making. I changed the sheets, the pillowcases, and then I proceeded to make the bed. I had to bring pillows for two, of course, but they're quite light, you see.
Phoenix:
I see. Thank you. ... (Pillows... for two!?) Bellboy! What did you just say?
Bellboy:
Eh!? Ah, yes, pillows are light... sir?
Phoenix:
Bellboy! Tell us the truth now... Was someone else staying in Miss May's room?
Edgeworth:

Leads to:
"I object! That was... objectionable!"Edgeworth:
I object! That was... objectionable!Judge:
... Objection overruled. The witness will answer the question.Bellboy:
Er... yes, I see.Phoenix:
Why did you not mention this in your testimony!?Bellboy:
W-well, sir, you er... you didn't ask!Phoenix:
(Nice try!) That's the sort of thing you're normally supposed to mention!Bellboy:
Ah, yes, quite. Indeed... It was the, er, good barrister there, Mr. Edgeworth, who...Phoenix:
!Bellboy:
He asked me not to mention it if I wasn't specifically asked, sir.Edgeworth:
Oof! Y-you fool!Phoenix:
I've done it... I've won!Phoenix:
Miss April May checked into a twin room... with a man. Correct?Bellboy:
Yes, sir.Phoenix:
Then, when you brought them room service, you didn't see that man in the room...?Bellboy:
That's right, sir.Judge:
Hmm...Phoenix:
Your Honor! We have just learned of another person involved who may have been the murderer! In light of this new fact, I hold that it's impossible to judge the defendant. (Changed from [In this new light, I hold that it's impossible to judge the defendant.] in the original release) You agree, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:
And who, Mr. Wright! Who is this "other person"! (Changed from [Who! Who is this 'other person'!] in the original release)Phoenix:
Simple, it was...Miss April May







Phoenix:
None other than Miss April May!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Eh!? Have you heard nothing that has transpired so far!? She has an alibi! She was in the hotel at the time of the murder!
Phoenix:
Oh... right.
Judge:
Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
S-sorry, Your Honor! Give me one more chance!
Leads back to:
"Simple, it was..."The man with Miss May







Leads to:
"The man who checked in with Miss May!"The Bellboy







Phoenix:
It was the bellboy and none other!
Judge:
Well, this comes as some surprise...
Edgeworth:
Your Honor, Mr. Wright... It was the bellboy who confirmed Miss May's alibi... And this in turn confirms the bellboy's alibi! He was in the hotel!
Phoenix:
Well, s-sure... if you put it that way...
Edgeworth:
I do put it that way, and I trust you will too!
Phoenix:
But what if they were in cahoots!
Judge:
You have evidence of this?
Phoenix:
Um... no, Your Honor.
Judge:
Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
S-sorry, Your Honor! Give me one more chance!
Leads back to:
"Simple, it was..."Phoenix:
The man who checked in with Miss May!Edgeworth:
Oof!Phoenix:
Your Honor! As has been previously revealed, Miss April May was tapping the victim's phone. Yet Miss May herself has an alibi at the time of the murder. However, that does not clear the man that was with her! The bellboy saw no one else in the room at the time of the murder!!!Edgeworth:
M-my, what a convenient little setup... but it's too late...Phoenix:
"Too late"? I suppose you'd like it if it was too late, wouldn't you... After all, it was you who hid the presence of the other man from this court!Edgeworth:
Oof! Upstart... amateur...! T-these accusations are... ludicrous!Judge:
Enough! The court acknowledges the defense's argument. I expect the prosecution and defense to look into this matter fully! Am I understood?Edgeworth:
Yes... *gasp* Yes, Your Honor.Judge:
That is all today for the trial of Maya Fey. Court is adjourned!September 7, 2:24 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Maya:
Mr. Wright! You were amazing in there!Phoenix:
R-really?Maya:
I think I might be your newest fan!Phoenix:
Oh, I was just "doing my job" you know... heh heh.Maya:
Then again, that other attorney was pretty cool, too...Phoenix:
Huh?Maya:
That face of his! With his eyes wide, and trembling lips! It sent shivers up my spine!Phoenix:
Hmm... if you say so.Maya:
So, what happens with me? Do I get to go home now?Phoenix:
Um, well... (Changed from [Well, no.] in the original release) No, I don't think so. Not yet. (Changed from [I don't think so. Not yet.] in the original release)Maya:
Oh... I see.Phoenix:
But I got a great lead in today's trial!Maya:
A "lead"?Phoenix:
That man with Miss May! He's the key!Maya:
Oh! I get it. What happened to Miss May after that, anyway?Phoenix:
I heard they arrested her. I guess she's learning her charms won't work everywhere. She's probably at the detention center now. I may have to go down there later. Anyway. This case is far from closed.Maya:
Yes sir!Phoenix:
I'm going to find out more about this man.Maya:
Do you think he was the one who...?Phoenix:
Maybe so.Maya:
Sis...Phoenix:
Don't worry, I'll find him by tomorrow. I promise.Maya:
I'm counting on you!Phoenix:
I asked for a full record of April May's testimony. I thought it might come in handy during the trial tomorrow. But now that I have it, I'm not so sure. Most of her testimony was all lies... In fact, there's only one part that hasn't been stricken from the record. (Changed from [In fact, there's only one part that got left on the record.] in the original release)May Testimony added to the Court Record.Phoenix:
I don't know how much good this will do me at all, now. Anyway, time to hit the pavement and do some investigating! Maya doesn't belong in that detention center, and it's up to me to set her free! (Changed from [Maya doesn't belong in that detention center, and it's up to me to get her free!] in the original release)To be continued.Presenting wrong evidence during testimony







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Judge:
...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory.
Phoenix:
Huh? Really?
Judge:
Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)Presenting wrong evidence during testimony







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
Judge:
Uh... I'm not sure I follow?

You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled.

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
How exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...?
Phoenix:
They aren't, are they...
Judge:
Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)Presenting wrong evidence during testimony







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
Judge:
... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Ugh. I must be on the wrong track?)Too many penalties







Judge:
That's enough! This court see no reason to further prolong the trial. The defense has failed to give the court sufficient reason to doubt the prosecution's claim! This court find the defendant, Ms. Maya Fey...

Guilty

Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!Turnabout Sisters

Well hello! I didn't expect anyone to visit me in such a dank place as this... It's really quite... moving. Not! You stinking lawyer! I hope you die! Have you come to laugh? Yes, laugh at the fallen Miss May!Phoenix:
No, not really, there's something I wanted to ask.April:
Unfortunately, there is nothing I want to BE asked. Haven't you done enough questioning, you...! Spiky-head!Phoenix:
(Here we go again...) Please, you're scaring the security guard.April:
... So? What is it you wish to ask of me, then? Hmm?Phoenix:
(For starters, how did you get to be so totally whacked!?)Examine









Security camera







Phoenix:
Smile for the camera...




Security guard







Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch. A real pro, this guy. Or maybe he just doesn't get to see a lot of women like Miss May in here.Talk









That "man"







Phoenix:
About the man who stayed with you in your hotel room...
April:
...
Phoenix:
Can you tell me about him? Where is he? C'mon...
April:
No way, Jose.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... maybe if I had something to get her to talk...)




The wiretap







Phoenix:
Why did you place a wiretap on Mia's phone?
April:
Aww, when you say it like that it sounds so... cold. So criminal!
Phoenix:
Um... tapping people's phones is a crime, Miss May.
April:
Oh, and I suppose you learned that in Lawyer School, hmm? Creep!
Phoenix:
(This woman is impossible to talk to...)




Your attitude







Phoenix:
Say... Why are you so... angry? I mean, you don't look like a bad person...
April:
Ooh, that does it! Bottom-feeding, scum-sucking lawyer!
Phoenix:
B-bottom...? (I can't tell, does she have a thing against lawyers... or just against me?)Present









Anything







April:
Hey, guess what. Actually, I, um, really hate your guts. So get lost. Because, well, I'm not cooperating.
Phoenix:
(Thanks, I noticed.)September 7Fey & Co. Law OfficesPhoenix:
Looks like forensics is taking the day off today. Detective Gumshoe's nowhere in sight. The police really gave this place a working over. I doubt there are any valuable clues left. Suppose it can't hurt to take a look around, though.Examine









Bookshelf







Phoenix:
You couldn't cram more legal books in here, even if you wanted to. All the cases that the chief worked on are filed here. Hmm. Are some of the files missing...? Nah, I'm imagining things.September 7Grossberg Law OfficesPhoenix:
(Huh. Looks like Grossberg is out today... again. Maybe he's avoiding me for some reason?)Examine









Photos on desk







Phoenix:
What's this? Old photos? There are two lying here. Something's been written in pencil on the backs. "DL-6 Incident - Exhibit A," "DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B"... Let's take a look at these...



"DL-6 Incident - Exhibit A"







Phoenix:
... I'm sure I've seen this person somewhere... Perhaps I'll borrow this photo. I'm sure no one will miss just one little photo. And it might be a valuable clue... I'll take it for now.
Photograph quietly added to the Court Record.
Leads back to examination




"DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B"







Phoenix:
Why would Grossberg have a picture of this man...? This might be a valuable clue... I'll take it for now. I'm just borrowing it. I'll return it later.
Photograph quietly added to the Court Record.
Leads back to examination




Leave them alone







Phoenix:
I don't need it now, whatever it is. If I ever run out of clues, I'll know where to find these. (Although I can't be sure the photos will still be here then...)
Leads back to examination





Photos on desk (after one has been added to the Court Record)







Phoenix:
A photo lies on the desk. Maybe I should switch it with the one I took?



Swap photos







Phoenix:
I think I'll swap them...
Photograph added to the Court Record.
Leads back to examination




Leave it alone







Phoenix:
No, on second thought, I'd better not.
Leads back to examination





Vacant wall







Phoenix:
Wait a second... Wasn't there a giant painting hanging on that wall...? Yeah... yeah, it was a painting of...



Sunflowers







Leads to:
"Wasn't it? It wasn't a very memorable painting, anyhow."




Marvin Grossberg







Leads to:
"Wasn't it? It wasn't a very memorable painting, anyhow."




Fishermen







Leads to:
"Wasn't it? It wasn't a very memorable painting, anyhow."


Phoenix:
Wasn't it? It wasn't a very memorable painting, anyhow.Detention Center (after visiting Grossberg Law Offices)April:
YOU AGAIN!? Can't you take a hint and stay gone?Phoenix:
Hey, the only reason I'm back here is because YOU won't talk to me!April:
Oh, so it's MY fault now? You don't just have spiky hair, you also have a spiky heart.Phoenix:
(That does it. When this case is done I'm shaving my head.)Talk









That "man"







Phoenix:
About the man who stayed with you in your hotel room... Can you tell me about him? Where is he?
April:
I'm not telling!
Phoenix:
Look, he's being accused of murder! I don't think you want to be protecting him.
April:
Hmm. Would you have sold out the late Ms. Fey to the cops?
Phoenix:
No.
April:
See?
Phoenix:
(Damn! Hmm... maybe if I had something to get her to talk...)Present









Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit A)







Phoenix:
Any thoughts about this photograph?
April:
... Who's that? Your mother?
Phoenix:
(... *sigh* Looks like I've just been wasting my time.)




Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B)







Phoenix:
Have a look at this.
April:
Look, I've said several times, I'm not telling you... ! Where did you...?
Phoenix:
(Ah hah! A reaction!) This is him, isn't it?
April:
What? Who? When? Why...?
Phoenix:
It IS him. This is the man who stayed in your hotel room the night of the murder!
April:
No! No, that's not right.
Phoenix:
(Nice try, Miss Cooperative.)
April:
D-do you have proof that was him? Hmm? Y-yeah! Proof! Show me proof!
Phoenix:
(I'm so close!)September 7Gatewater HotelRoom 303Bellboy:
Ah, welcome, sir! Quite the performance today, if I dare say so myself.Phoenix:
Oh, um, thanks. Sorry for putting you on the spot like that.Bellboy:
No, no, not at all, sir! Your efforts today can only help the Gatewater's "rep," as they say.Phoenix:
Huh? "Rep"?Bellboy:
Yes! Our reputation will swell as the hotel where the murderer used a wiretap! We can charge a premium for the room, of course. It will be great for business, sir!Phoenix:
Whoa, whoa! Miss May hasn't been charged with murder.Bellboy:
I, too, will become famous! "The Bellboy who brought the murderer ice coffee"...!Phoenix:
(Why do I feel like we're both stuck in the same bad dream...)Bellboy:
So! You are our honored guest. Please let me know if there is anything I can bring you!Examine









Flowers







Phoenix:
A vase, as expected. I'm not good with flower names, except maybe tulips and sunflowers.




Open drawer







Phoenix:
Huh? There's still a screwdriver stuck in that drawer!
Bellboy:
Ah, please leave that as it is, sir. That's the "Drawer of Terror, Hiding Place of the Murderer's Wiretap." It's set to become one of the most popular attractions here.
Phoenix:
(This guy's serious! I don't believe it...)




Table







Phoenix:
A bottle and two glasses rest on the table. Why hasn't he cleaned these up by now?
Bellboy:
Ah, I beg your pardon, sir, but if you could please refrain from touching those... It's part of the decor. I call it: "The last drink... before murder!" We'll be famous! The talk of the hotel industry!




Window







Phoenix:
Nice weather again today. I can see the Fey & Co. Law Offices, of course.
Bellboy:
Ah, yes. We plan to install a telescope in that window, of course. Just $5.00 will earn you three minutes of a "view to a kill"!
Phoenix:
...
Bellboy:
J-just kidding, sir. Oh hoh hoh hoh!
Phoenix:
(By that look in his eyes I'd say he was more than serious...)Talk









Miss May







Phoenix:
About Miss May...
Bellboy:
Oh, her? Sir, not to boast but I knew the moment I saw her... "She'd do it!" I said!
Phoenix:
(Do WHAT!? I'm starting to think the most suspicious person here is this guy!)




The man with May







Phoenix:
I wanted to ask you about the man who was with Miss May...?
Bellboy:
Ah, yes... He struck me as a real "Lady Killer," if you'll pardon the expression. I knew it from the moment I saw him, sir. He and I are of the same ilk. We both carry the scent of... danger.
Phoenix:
(There we are in total agreement, Mr. Psycho Bellboy.)
Bellboy:
If you had a photo of that man, I'm quite sure I could identify him.
Phoenix:
(A photo. Hmm...)




The hotel







Phoenix:
Could you tell me about this hotel?
Bellboy:
Absolutely! And on that subject, I have an excellent idea, sir! Currently, this hotel is known as the "Gatewater." I propose that we add a subtitle!
Phoenix:
A subtitle!?
Bellboy:

The Gatewater Hotel -- Murder Manor --
Well? What do you think?
Phoenix:
Um... sounds great! (Whatever floats your tea set...)Present









Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit A)







Phoenix:
What about this photo?
Bellboy:
Well, it's a fine photo, sir. However, the person Miss May was accompanied by was, well, a man.
Phoenix:
(Oh... yeah. Right.)




Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B)







Phoenix:
Take a look at this photo.
Bellboy:
... That's him, Detective.
Phoenix:
Um... I'm the lawyer.
Bellboy:
Oh, I know that! I just wanted to say "Detective" once. You know how it is.
Phoenix:
(No. No I don't.)
Bellboy:
Without a doubt, that is the man who checked in with Miss April May. How about I write an affidavit swearing that that's him!
Phoenix:
An affidavit? (This guy is way too excited about this...)



Have him write it







Phoenix:
Well, sure. Why not?
Bellboy:
Yes! I've always wanted to write an affidavit, sir. From hence forth I will be known as "The Bellboy who swore the affidavit"! (Changed from [From hence forth I will be known as the 'bellboy who swore the affidavit'!] in the original release)
Phoenix:
Just hurry up and write it.
Bellboy's Affidavit added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(Not even Miss May can play dumb to this!)
Leads back to Court Record




Turn him down







Phoenix:
Well thanks, but I don't think that will be necessary.
Bellboy:
Oh? Oh, I see. Well later then, if you need it.
Leads back to Court Record





Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B) (after Bellboy's Affidavit is added to the Court Record)







Phoenix:
Sorry to press the matter, but are you sure this is him?
Bellboy:
I, too, am sorry to press the matter, but that is him, Detective!
Phoenix:
Umm... thanks.




Bellboy's Affidavit







Phoenix:
Thanks for this.
Bellboy:
No no no, not at all, sir! I hope you'll use it to take that Miss May down hard, sir! Hard!
Phoenix:
(Why do I sense an unhealthy level of excitement behind that unchanging smile? His tea set is rattling!)




Anything else







Bellboy:
I'm sorry... All I could think about during the trial was the hotel... I wasn't paying much attention to the evidence.Grossberg Law Offices (after Bellboy's Affidavit is added to the Court Record)Phoenix:
(*sigh* He's out again? Huh? No more photos on the desk...)Detention CenterPresent









Bellboy's Affidavit







Phoenix:
Could you have a look at this?
April:
What's that?
Phoenix:
The bellboy's affidavit! He told us everything he saw. He told us about the man you checked in with. He told us who he was.
April:
...!
Phoenix:
(Now I'm getting somewhere!)



Ease her fears







Phoenix:
(Okay, okay... she's vulnerable now. I should be gentle.) Miss May... It would be easy for me to hand this affidavit to the police.
April:
...
Phoenix:
If they get involved, wouldn't your boss be even more... er... inconvenienced? All I want to do is have a little chat with him. You won't tell me?
April:
... Is that all you have to say?
Phoenix:
Yes.
April:
Id it's so easy for you to "get the police involved," then why don't you? Somehow I think you're not up to it, hmm?
Phoenix:
(Show them a little kindness and they jump all over you! That had the opposite effect to what I hoped...)
April:
Aww. *smirk* Poor little lawyer... And you were so close!
Phoenix:
(This isn't working... I think I've worn out this piece of paper's usefulness.) Dammit!
Bellboy's Affidavit discarded. (Changed from [Discarded the Bellboy's Affidavit.] in the original release)
Phoenix:
(The man in this photo is the one I want! Why did April May not want to talk about it... she must know him!)
Leads back to Court Record




Push her hard







Phoenix:
(This is it, all or nothing! Time to do a little bluff.) No use playing dumb! (If, indeed, that's an act.) If you don't talk, I'm taking this photo to the press!
April:
Whaaaaat!?
Phoenix:
Even though he should've been witness to murder, your little "friend" is missing. (Changed from [Even though he should be a witness to murder, this man is in hiding.] in the original release) I'm sure the press would have a field day with his reputation!
April:
...! Ooooh! Fine! I'll talk! You... you win, Lawyer.
Phoenix:
(Yes! Man, that felt good! It's great to be alive!)
April:
Why are you pumping your fists in the air?
Phoenix:
*cough* Now, tell me about the man you were with.
April:
That man... He's my boss. Redd White, the president of the information gathering conglomerate, Bluecorp.
Phoenix:
(Redd... White?) "Information gathering?"
April:
Well... I suppose you could call it a detective agency. (Changed from [Well... I suppose you could call them a detective agency.] in the orignal release)
Phoenix:
Hmm... So this is the man that was with you the night of the murder?
April:
... I'm... I'm scared to talk. I don't want to end up like her!
Phoenix:
(...!) It's okay, I'll just ask Mr. White himself. Can you tell me where Bluecorp is located?
April:
...
Phoenix:
(Mr. Redd White, at last! Finally, a lead on this guy! If April May couldn't have done it, that leaves him! Time to take action!)

Hmm. The bellboy seems to be out. Huh? The sound of water coming from the shower...Bellboy:

Open drawer







Phoenix:
The screwdriver is still stuck in the drawer. I'd better not touch it. No telling what the bellboy would do to me.

(Ah, that old familiar clearing of the throat...)Grossberg:
Ah hah! You again.Phoenix:
Um, hello, Mr. Grossberg.Grossberg:
... Well, well. You were quite the thing, my boy.Phoenix:
Excuse me...?Grossberg:
The trial! The trial!Phoenix:
(He was there...?)Grossberg:
Reminded me of myself when I was a youth!Phoenix:
(I guess something got passed down through Mia... maybe?)Grossberg:
It brings back memories, it does! "Ah... the days of my youth... like the scent of fresh lemon..." you see. ... I apologize.Phoenix:
?Grossberg:
I... It was all a bit too much for me, my boy. Seeing you today, I... well, I... ...Phoenix:
(I appreciate the reminiscing, but I'd much rather you gave me some information!)Talk









Today's trial







Phoenix:
So you came to see the trial?
Grossberg:
Yes, yes I did. Something was bothering me all last night, you see. I couldn't get a wink of sleep.
Phoenix:
Really? What was that?
Grossberg:
Well, you see, it's just... Mia's sister, that poor girl. My boy, I owe you my thanks, truly. I don't know what I would have done if things had gone poorly for the girl.
Phoenix:
(If you were that worried about it, why didn't you offer to defend her!?)




Your refusal







Phoenix:
I asked before, but, why did you refuse her request for defense? I think I have a right to know.
Grossberg:
A right, Mr. Wright? No, no, I'm sorry. It's just, I need more time to think about it, my boy.
Phoenix:
... (He does seem troubled about something... Maybe I can find something that will inspire him to talk.)




That painting







Phoenix:
The other day I'm sure there was a big, pretentious-looking painting on that wall...
Grossberg:
"Pretentious-looking"...?
Phoenix:
Well... you know the one I mean. Anyway, where did it go?
Grossberg:
Ah, yes, well... I... got rid of it. Got quite tired of the thing, really. I, er, sold it, you see. Yes, that's right.
Phoenix:
(Sold it!? I'm not sure I buy that...) Wasn't that painting rather important to you, sir? Did something happen?
Grossberg:
I don't see how it's any of your business! Please, speak no more of that accursed painting. I didn't... I... *mumble* *mumble*




Any option (after presenting Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B))







Phoenix:
Mr. Grossberg...?
Grossberg:
... Ah, my apologies. I need to think about things. Alone.
Phoenix:
(He barely even glanced in my direction...)Present









Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B) (if "Ease her fears" was selected upon presenting Bellboy's Affidavit in Detention Center - Visitor's Room)







Phoenix:
Excuse me, I was wondering about this photograph...
Grossberg:
...! Where did you get that!?
Phoenix:
I borrowed it.
Grossberg:
Well, give it back at once!
Phoenix:
Mr. Grossberg. Tell me about the man in this photo. He may have been in that hotel room with April May on the night of the murder. Do you know something about him... anything?
Grossberg:
...! Hmm. Ahem! Very well. I'll tell you what I know. However... You didn't hear it from me, if you follow.
Phoenix:
I follow.
Grossberg:
That man is Mr. Redd White. He's the President of Bluecorp.
Phoenix:
(Redd White... Hmm.) Bluecorp... they're something like a detective agency, right?
Grossberg:
They're information pros. They sell information, you see. Sensitive information. Despite his name, Mr. White has the blackest reputation of any man in this country. Should you run across him, watch what you say. You wouldn't want him digging up any dirt on you.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... selling information. Sounds like blackmail.) Can you tell me where Bluecorp is located?
Grossberg:
Hmm... I suppose.
Phoenix:
(Mr. Redd White, at last! Finally, a lead on this guy! Even if April May couldn't have done it, he could have! Time to take action!)
Returned photograph to Mr. Grossberg.
Grossberg:
Now, I must ask you to leave. I need to think about things. Alone.

Phoenix:
Excuse me, I was wondering about this photograph...
Grossberg:
Where did you get that!? Give it back at once!
Phoenix:
I'm sorry to have taken it without your knowledge. But... I have to know. Who is this man? He was most likely in April May's room the night of the murder.
Grossberg:
! What's that you say!? A-are you QUITE sure? My boy?
Phoenix:
(What has him so flustered I wonder...?)
Grossberg:
I... I beg your pardon, but I must ask you to leave. I need to be alone.
Phoenix:

Welcome! Please furnish me with the title of your personage!Phoenix:
(What the...?)White:
Your name! What's your name? I was just inquirably asking the title that you go by.Phoenix:
Uh... Wright. Phoenix Wright. ("Inquirably"...?)White:
Mr. Wright, is it? Right, I see... Splendiferous. Perhaps I have intimidated you with my giantesque vocabulary...?Phoenix:
(What is this guy's problem!)White:
I'm Redd White, CEO of Bluecorp. You know, Corporate Expansion Official? My business dealings bring me into contact with the elite of the elite. So I'm afraid I am not used to conversing with the wordily-challenged.Phoenix:
(What a fruitcake!)White:
Hmmm, let me guess... You are an attorney fresh out of law school, are you not? That's the only explanation for why you would come to meet me like this!Phoenix:
(What does he mean by that?)White:
No matter. So, what business does a "mighty" lawyer have with a man such as myself?Phoenix:
(Yipes! This guy's arrogance meter is off the scale!)Examine









Desk







Phoenix:
I'm guessing this is supposed to be a desk? My my... This is quite the... thing.
White:
It is modeled on my body, see? Well? Does its sleek roundature not... inspire you?




Painting







Phoenix:
...? Haven't I seen this somewhere...? Is this a replica?
White:
Ridiculosity! I have no interest in anything but originals. That right there is a bona fide original! Worth five million, for sure.
Phoenix:
Hmmm...




Statue







Phoenix:
A statue of a man holding up the world. The "Bluecorp" sign certainly stands out enough... The model for the man is, of course, Mr. White.
White:
Truly a work of art! But, probably to beautacious for you to appreciate, correct?
Phoenix:
(I think it's a little too "beautacious" for just about anyone to appreciate.)




Trophy display







Phoenix:
An impressive line-up of trophies. "Judges Special Runner-up" "Best Participation" "Judges Cooperation Award" "Special Good Try Prize" Hmm. The words "Judges" and "Special" kind of stand out.




Window







Phoenix:
This is the top floor of a 20-story building. The view is quite... presidential.Talk









Miss May







Phoenix:
Miss May is an employee of Bluecorp, is she not?
White:
Correct. She was my secretariat. What a shock it was to hear what she has done!
Phoenix:
"What she has done"... You mean the wiretap?
White:
Indeed! She is paid to answer phones. Tapping them is NOT in her job description. She does gather information for us as part of her duties. But, I assure you, we do not condone illegal methods! It is ineffable that she would do this.
Phoenix:
(It sounds like he's trying to turn Miss May into a scapegoat...)




Night of the murder







Phoenix:
On the night of the murder were you in April May's hotel room?
White:
Who can say? I seldom pay attention to mundane details such as time and place. My motto is: "Don't worry, be happy!"
Phoenix:
Still, Mr. White... The hotel bellboy has stated on the record that he does remember you very clearly.
White:
... No matter! The bellboy can say what he pleases. I still won't talk to you. If you want me to speak, put me on the witness stand! Although I doubt you'd be capable of doing that.
Phoenix:
(Hmm. He raises a good question, actually... Why didn't prosecution call him as a witness? He should have "seen" the same thing as April May!)
White:
Oh hoh hoh. The police... the courts... To me they are mere toys. Playthings for my amusement!




Bluecorp







Phoenix:
What kind of company is Bluecorp, anyway?
White:
Ah, excellent question! We buy and sell various kinds of information. We are a company of the future! You might say, we ARE the future!
Phoenix:
(Sell... information?)
White:
In just 10 years, I've built this business up into the grand office you see now. Ah, in case you were wondering, Bluecorp was named after the color "blue"! I, Redd White of Bluecorp, as founder and CEO, named it so! And why, you ask? Because I like the color blue of course! Fantabulistic, is it not?




That painting (appears after "Miss May" and "Night of the murder")







Phoenix:
Uh... there's something that's been bothering me.
White:
Yes? What might that be?
Phoenix:
That big painting on the wall over there...



It's gorgeous







Phoenix:
It's a very striking piece of art.
White:
Magnificentatious, isn't it!
Phoenix:
Yeah. ... (Why am I making small talk...?)
Leads back to Talk options




I've seen it before







Phoenix:
You know, I've actually seen that painting before.
White:
Oh?
Phoenix:
Just yesterday, actually.
White:
Your point being...?
Phoenix:
My point is simple. Er, rather, my question is simple: Why is that painting hanging on your wall?
Leads to:
"..."




When did you get it?







Phoenix:
Say, when did you get that painting?
White:
... Hmm... no idea! I forgot!
Phoenix:
I've seen that painting before. Yesterday, in fact. Why do I find that painting here today?
Leads to:
"..."Present









Wiretap







Phoenix:
About this wiretap...
White:
Ah, the one that Miss May used, right? Bad girl. Bad, bad girl.
Phoenix:
She testified that she placed the wiretap at your request.
White:
How pathetic. I guess she's trying to pass the buck. Bad, bad girl. Sorry I can't help you. I know nothing.
Phoenix:
(I'm going to need hard evidence to get anything out of this guy...)




Photograph (DL-6 Incident - Exhibit B)







Phoenix:
About this picture...
White:
Gorgeous! That's a picture of me! Ah, I see it was taken in the prime of my youth. About 10 years ago, at a guess.
Phoenix:
The hotel bellboy says he saw this man on the night of the murder.
White:
... On closer inspection, he does look a lot like me, but I'm afraid this is someone else. Nope. That's definitely not me. He's far too young.




Anything else







White:
I am terribly sorry. But that really doesn't seem to concern me at all.White:
... Mr. Wrong, was it?Phoenix:
Wright.White:
It appears you do not fully grasp your position here. I ask again. Who are you?Phoenix:
Umm... huh? A lawyer?White:
No, my feeble friend. A "mere" lawyer. Worth nothing. Zilch. Zippo. Nada! Just like that sorry excuse for an attorney, Grodyburger!Phoenix:
(Wh-what!?) Ungh! Oof...! Unh... uhhh... (He... he punched me!)White:
Well, Mr. Lawyer. What will you do, eh? Charge me with assault? Charge away, I welcome it! For it is YOU who will be found guilty!Phoenix:
What...?White:
Heed my exposition! The police, the courts, they all do my bidding.Phoenix:
(So you say... But I wonder... Is that kind of control really possible?)White:
I don't expect you to understand. It is a world beyond your compensation. ... You came here from Grodyburger's, I presume?Phoenix:
Mr. Grossberg's... yes.White:
Then you must ask him: Why is it that this painting of his hangs here? Perhaps then he will tell you? Perhaps he will explain how a man can live life purely for personal profit! ... Go now! Skedaddle! There is nothing more to discuss!Examine









Desk







Phoenix:
I'm guessing this is supposed to be a desk? My my... This is quite the... thing.




Painting







Phoenix:
This painting was, until yesterday, hanging in Mr. Grossberg's office. Why does White have it now? It's not hard to imagine a few possibilities.




Statue







Phoenix:
A statue of a man holding up the world. The "Bluecorp" sign certainly stands out enough... The model for the man is, of course, Mr. White.




Trophy display







Phoenix:
An impressive line-up of trophies. "Judges Special Runner-up" "Best Participation" "Judges Cooperation Award" "Special Good Try Prize" Hmm. The words "Judges" and "Special" kind of stand out. He probably strong-armed them into giving him something.Talk

Security guard







Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He hasn't moved an inch. A real pro, this guy.Grossberg Law Offices (after selecting ""I've seen it before" or "When did you get it?" upon selecting "That painting" Talk option in Bluecorp)Grossberg:
... ... ...Phoenix:
(Huh? I don't think he's noticed me standing here. Maybe I should... clear my throat?) Aaa-HHHEM!Grossberg:
Jumping Jehosephats! Oh! You!Phoenix:
What's wrong? You looked so pensive... like an old man at the end of his days.Grossberg:
Hmm? I'm not senile yet! I was just thinking about this whole mess...Phoenix:
(Something's really bothering him, that much is clear.)Talk









Today's trial







Phoenix:
So you came to see the trial?
Grossberg:
Yes, yes I did. Something was bothering me all last night, you see, couldn't get a wink of sleep.
Phoenix:
Really? What was that?
Grossberg:
Well, you see, it's just... Mia's sister, that poor girl. My boy, I owe you my thanks, truly. I don't know what I would have done if things had gone poorly for the girl.




Your refusal







Phoenix:
I asked before, but, why did you refuse her request for defense? I think I have a right to know.
Grossberg:
A right, Mr. Wright? No, no, I'm sorry. It's just, I need more time to think about it, my boy.
Phoenix:
... (He does seem troubled about something... I'm starting to have a feeling I know what it is.)




Mr. White







Phoenix:
So, I paid Bluecorp a visit.
Grossberg:
Oh? Oh, I see.
Phoenix:
Mr. Grossberg... I have to admit, something has been bothering me.
Grossberg:
Oh? What is it? Well, out with it, my boy!
Phoenix:
You see, it's just...



That big painting







Phoenix:
Mr. Grossberg, sir... There was a giant painting hanging right there the other day, was there not? The one you said you had "no intention of parting with"? Well, I saw it. Today. It was in the CEO's office at Bluecorp. Redd White's office.
Grossberg:
... So... you noticed. I suppose I should have guessed you would. It is a large painting...
Phoenix:
Mr. Grossberg, I know you and Mr. White are connected somehow!
Grossberg:
C-connected, you say?
Phoenix:
Yes! And I know what it is...



He's giving you information







Phoenix:
You're his client, aren't you? He's giving you information!
Grossberg:
What's that now?
Phoenix:
You've been protecting him all along. You protect him because you need his services!
Grossberg:
...
Phoenix:
You gave him that painting in exchange for some valuable information, didn't you?
Grossberg:
Utterly ridiculous. Me, his client? I would never willingly deal with that man. Never!
Phoenix:
(Huh? Did I get it wrong?)

He's blackmailing you







Phoenix:
Mr. White has something on you doesn't he? Blackmail?
Grossberg:
...!
Phoenix:
I think that painting is fairly gaudy proof.
Grossberg:
... Very well. This may be the chance I've been waiting for. Maybe it's time to get this off my chest, so I can finally rest easy again. After all, you were Mia's understudy. Perhaps it was fate?
Phoenix:
(What's he talking about...?)
Leads to:
"Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation."




You're lovers







Phoenix:
It's not something I can claim to understand... But you and Mr. White are lovers, aren't you!
Grossberg:
W-w-what! My boy!
Phoenix:
You sent that painting to him! As a sign! A sign of undying love!
Grossberg:
M-m-my boy, please! You're letting your fancies run away with you! Where do you get these bizarre ideas?
Phoenix:
I... I don't understand how you could...
Grossberg:
That's because I'm not, we're not... Don't be ridiculous! ... Enough. I'll swallow my pride and tell you all.
Phoenix:
(I knew it! They are lovers!)
Grossberg:
N-no! We are NOT lovers!
Leads to:
"Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation."





That photo of Mr. White







Phoenix:
That photo of Mr. White... Why would you have his photo, Mr. Grossberg?
Grossberg:
Umm... yes, well. It's been a long time since then...
Phoenix:
A long time ago? I'm sorry... but I think not. I think you still have ties to Mr. White even today.
Grossberg:
R-really! Whatever gave you that idea! W-what connection could I possibly have to an individual such as he?
Phoenix:
It's pretty straightforward, actually...



You go drinking together







Phoenix:
You go drinking together! You're friends, aren't you?
Grossberg:
... Now you're being foolish, my boy. Why in the world would I ever drink with the likes of him!?
Phoenix:
(Huh? Whoops... maybe that wasn't it.)

Redd White is supplying you with information, obviously!

What's that now?

You've been protecting him all along. You protect him because you need his services!

Why wouldn't you defend Maya?







Phoenix:
I thought it was strange. Here was Maya, your own apprentice's little sister, in desperate need... Accused of killing her own sister no less, and you wouldn't take the case! I finally realized why. You and Redd White are connected. He's...



Your boss







Phoenix:
I'll bet you and White go way back! He's your boss now, and was before, I bet!
Grossberg:
My what? Boss? Are you serious?
Phoenix:
Yeah! You both have that sort of "we're in the same club together" feel to you.
Grossberg:
Please, stop. You have a very peculiar sense of humor, Mr. Wright. Very well, I'll talk.
Phoenix:
(What does he mean... "sense of humor"? I was serious!)
Leads to:
"Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation."




Blackmailing you







Phoenix:
Mr. White has something on you doesn't he? Blackmail?
Grossberg:

It's not something I can claim to understand... But you and Mr. White are lovers, aren't you!
Grossberg:
W-w-what! My boy!
Phoenix:
Mr. Grossberg. The other day, there was a giant painting hanging on that wall. I saw that painting again, today. It was in the CEO's office of Bluecorp. It was a present, wasn't it?
Grossberg:
Well, my boy, you have a splendid imagination!
Phoenix:
I... I don't understand how you could...
Grossberg:
That's because I'm not, we're not... Don't be ridiculous!
Phoenix:

Leads back to Talk optionsPresent









Anything







Grossberg:
Sorry, my boy. I don't think I can help you with that.Grossberg:
Redd White is a man who makes his living through intimidation. Bluecorp is a company that excels in finding people's weaknesses, I'm afraid. I've been paying them for 15 years now...Phoenix:
(15 years...!)Grossberg:
All because of the "DL-6 Incident," as you may have guessed.Phoenix:
(The name on the back of those photographs!)Grossberg:
As you suspected, I could not stand in defense of Maya because of this. White would have destroyed me if I did.Phoenix:
(So that's the connection!)Grossberg:
It is hard for me to tell you this, my boy. But arresting Redd White will be nigh on impossible.Phoenix:
Impossible? Why!?Grossberg:
He has information on everyone. It gives him an iron grip! He owns judges, attorneys, prosecutors, police... and politicians.Phoenix:
What!?Grossberg:
They are bound, unable to do harm to themselves, and therefore, to him. Don't look at me like that. What you see is nothing more than the weight of many years.Talk









The DL-6 Incident







Phoenix:
What is the "DL-6 Incident"?
Grossberg:
"DL-6" is nothing more than the sorting code the police gave the case. It was 15 years ago now... I received a request from a medium. A spirit medium.
Phoenix:
(A medium...?)
Grossberg:
Her name was Misty Fey.
Phoenix:
(Fey!)
Grossberg:
Indeed. She was Mia's mother. She had been investigating a murder at the bequest of the police. And... she failed. As a result, the police called her a fraud.
Phoenix:
(This is what Maya was talking about the other day!)
Grossberg:
I did all I could for her, and in the end, cleared her of wrongdoing. That murder case, however remains unsolved to this day. That case, is the DL-6 Incident.




Reason for blackmail







Phoenix:
But why were you blackmailed over this, Mr. Grossberg?
Grossberg:
The DL-6 Incident was top-secret at the time. It made sense. The police didn't want people to know they were using a medium! They couldn't let people know. But one person found out. I... I told him.
Phoenix:
You told White?
Grossberg:
He offered me riches... It is an embarrassment to me now. Because I talked, the police were mocked far and wide. In secret, they began looking for the one who sold them out. Of course White heard about it, and he came to me. Only this time, the offer was blackmail.
Phoenix:
... I see.
Grossberg:
... White controls the law of this country as he sees fit. Yet if you would still challenge him... Have a close look at Mia's office.
Phoenix:
Mia's office...?
Grossberg:
She followed his every move for years. She may have recorded something of what she found.Fey & Co. Law Offices (after clearing "Reason for blackmail" Talk option in Grossberg Law Offices)Phoenix:
It's funny, looking at this room, it seems... so normal. Hard to imagine a murder took place here. Mr. Grossberg said there would be clues... Maybe I should have another look.Examine









Bookshelf







Phoenix:
All the cases the chief ever worked on are filed here. They're in alphabetical order. Let's take a look... Which file should I look at...?



File "A-I"







Phoenix:
Let's see if there's "A" record in this file that catches my "I." "A"... "B"... "F"! "Misty Fey." That's Mia and Maya's mother. Hmmm... Should I take a look?



Read it







Mia:
"'I have tarnished the Fey name.' Leaving only these words, my mother vanished. I was determined to find the ones who had made my mother blame herself in this way. Using the E.S.P. that runs in my family, I held an audience with the dead. Finally, the names of two men surfaced. One was Marvin Grossberg, a lawyer who sold my mother's information for riches. The other was the man who sold that information to the press. This parasite, who makes his fortune on threats and coercion... His name is..."
Phoenix:
Hmm. The record stops there. ... So Mia knew Grossberg...

Leave it be







Phoenix:
I don't think it has much to do with the current case. I'd be interested to know what it contains... but I'll leave it alone for now.

File "J-S"







Phoenix:
Let's see... "J" through "S"... Nothing much in here. Maybe I'll just skim some of this?



Skim







Phoenix:
*sigh* Well, no harm in flipping through a bit, I guess... The biggest part's here at the end in "S"... "Suicide"? Eww... She has a collection of suicide reports. There's politicians... policemen... ... ...! There's writing on most of these in pencil. "White"...? This is Mia's handwriting. Wait, I get it! Mia thought he was involved in these "suicides"! White drove them all to... ... I can use these newspaper clippings. Hmm... let's find the most disturbing one...

Newspaper Clipping







Phoenix:
(This is the only clue that Mia left me... I'd better make this one count!) Mr. White... see this? It's an article describing the suicide of a politician.
White:
...
Phoenix:
He was embezzling secret government funds. Then, one day, word got leaked to the press. The very next day he took his own life.
White:
And this concerns me how...?
Phoenix:
I found this article in Mia's office.
White:
Miss Mia...?
Phoenix:
She had a file filled with articles like this. Every one of them was labeled with a single word... "White."
White:
...!
Phoenix:
Mr. White, I know what you did to this politician.



You bribed him







Phoenix:
You bribed him!
White:
B-bribed!? ... What exactly has led you to say this?
Phoenix:
(Um... gee, that's a good question. I guess I got ahead of myself there...)
White:
Hmph. You certainly have an active imagination.
Phoenix:
(Dammit!)

You spied on him







Phoenix:
You were spying on him, weren't you?
White:
"Spying"...?
Phoenix:
You snooped on him, and found out about the embezzlement. Then, when you revealed it, he was driven to suicide!
White:
Mr. Lawyer. I know nothing of this. And, even in the highly unlikely event that I did do such a thing... All I would have done is provide "information." That is not a crime in this country.
Phoenix:
(Gah! This guy's as cool as a cucumber...!)

Blackmail?Phoenix:
Not just him, either. You were threatening and coercing hundreds of others! You were involved in all of the suicide cases that Mia investigated! This company is built on blackmail! I'm right, aren't I?White:
What a bizarre accusation. Mr. Wrong... What is it that you should be doing now? Investigating me? No no no. I think not! You should be searching for the one who killed Miss Mia!Interphone:*beep*[Secretary's Office, hello?]White:

Well... I guess this is it!Phoenix:
Yeah. One way or another, this case gets decided today.Maya:
Aaa! Ph-Phoenix! Look!Phoenix:
(...! Prosecutor... Edgeworth.)Edgeworth:
I received a call from the public prosecutor's office yesterday.Phoenix:
?Edgeworth:
He told me that whatever Mr. White says today, it will be the "absolute truth." No matter how you try to attack his testimony... If I raise an objection, I have it on good faith that the judge will listen to me.Phoenix:
(What, does White have the judge in his pocket, too!?) So... you're saying I'm going to be guilty. End of story?Edgeworth:
... I will do anything to get my verdict, Mr. Wright. Anything.Maya:
Why... Why!? How can you torment an innocent person like this!?Edgeworth:
"Innocent"...? How can we know that? The guilty will always lie, to avoid being found out. There's no way to tell who is guilty and who is innocent! All that I can hope to do is get every defendant declared "guilty"! So I make that my policy.Phoenix:
Edgeworth... You've changed.Maya:
Hmm? Phoenix! You know him!?Edgeworth:
Don't expect any special treatment, Phoenix Wright.Maya:
Ph-Phoenix...?Phoenix:
Well... court will be starting soon. (Changed from [Well... court will be opening for session soon.] in the original release)Maya:
What? But wait! Your defense attorney isn't even here yet! They're not... (Changed from [Your defense attorney isn't even here yet! He's not...] in the original release)Phoenix:
I'll be defending myself.Maya:
Whaaaat!?Phoenix:
Okay, let's do this.September 9, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 1Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Phoenix Wright.Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:
Mr. Wright... Are you sure you're up to doing this?Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. I will be defending myself.Judge:
Understood. Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth:
As the details of the event are already quite clear to the court, today we will hear the testimony of a witness to the defendant's crime. (Changed from [today we will hear the testimony of another witness to the defendant's crime.] in the original release)Judge:
I see. The prosecution may call its witness.Phoenix:
(That went far too smoothly! Why didn't the judge ask Edgeworth why his witness didn't testify before!? It's like... it's like he already knows why! Hmm. If anyone's going to raise an objection about this, I suppose it's me...)Objection







Phoenix:
Mr. Edgeworth, you owe an explanation to the court! Why didn't this witness testify in the trial against Ms. Maya Fey!?
Edgeworth:
Hmph. I'm ever so sorry! Mr. White is a busy man, and besides... at the time, I thought that Ms. May's opinion was all that would be needed. Again, my sincerest apologies to the court.
Judge:
Excellent, Mr. Edgeworth. I appreciate your demeanor.
Edgeworth:

Er... your name?White:
Yes! That is what I said! Oh dear, do my locutions confuse?Edgeworth:
Name!Phoenix:
(These two are great together...)White:
My name is Redd White. But my friends call me Blanco Nino. I am the CEO, or to use a more common term, the President, of Bluecorp.Edgeworth:
Did you know the victim, Ms. Mia Fey?White:
That would be a negatory! No, I did not.Edgeworth:
... You were at the Gatewater Hotel the night of the murder?White:
Correct.Edgeworth:
And you witnessed the murder from there?White:
Ahem. Why tell you what you already know?Judge:
Very well, Mr. White. You may begin your testimony.Phoenix:
(If I can't rip this guy's testimony apart, I'm done for. Why do I always feel like it's the end of the world and I'm the last man standing?)White:
Ho hoh hoh. I hope you have made your peace with God, Mr. Lawyer!Phoenix:

Surprised, I turned to look at the building across the way.
It was then I saw him: a spiky-haired man attacking a woman with long hair!
Needless to say that man was none other than you, Mr. Lawyer!
I called Miss May over at once. She, too, was flabbergasted of course.
The victim, she... she ran away, but you gave chase!
Finally there was a terrible impaction! Then it was all over...Judge:
Hmm... If things occurred as you testify, then I'm afraid the defendant is guilty. Very well, defendant... er, I mean, Mr. Wright. Your cross-examination...Phoenix:

White:

Phoenix:
No no no, you're not getting away with that!
White:
You are so mistrusting, Mr. Lawyer! So... what was the proper term for "secretary" again...? Anyway, Miss May ordered room service for 9:00. It happened soon after the room service arrived.
Phoenix:
(Hmm. That's what Miss May said, too.)

Phoenix:
True, the bellboy who brought the coffee saw Miss May. But he testified that he did not see you at the time!

Ahem. This is your concern? Silly Lawyer! Miss May received the coffee outside the room! Of course he could not see me. He would need X-ray vision to pull off something like that!

You said the victim ran to the "left." But that directly contradicts Miss May's testimony! She clearly stated that the victim ran "right"!White:
...! Oh hoh hoh. It is simple. You have misheard her.Phoenix:
I think not. Look at the floor plans... The killer was here. And the victim, here. If the victim ran to the left, as you claim she did... She would have been running directly away from the door! She would have been running into a dead end! Don't you find that odd?White:

True. (Maybe he really did see the victim run left...? So he did witness the killing...? Wait a second!)Judge:

Miss May says "right," and Mr. White says "left." Can you explain this contradiction to the court?Mr. White is right







Phoenix:
As Mr. White testified, Mia ran to the left.
Judge:
But... But if that's the case... Why would she run in the opposite direction from the door?

She did not. She was running towards the door, Your Honor.

Bwah! Now you're the one making a contradiction, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
Not at all.

As Miss May has stated, Mia ran to the right after she was attacked.

Now, what did Mr. White say in his testimony?White:
It was the beginning of September... the week before the murder.Phoenix:
He said he saw the stand the week before the murder!Mia:
There you go! I think the court is about to reconvene! Go do it, Phoenix! You know you're innocent, now you just have to prove it!Phoenix:
Right!Receipt updated in the Court Record.September 9, 1:16 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 1Judge:

2025-01-22 14:43:48,318 - INFO - Assistant reply: To find a contradiction in the testimony of Mr. White, I need to pinpoint any inconsistency that can be proven with evidence. Let's revisit White's testimony:

1. "It was the beginning of September... the week before the murder."
2. "I had entered the Fey & Co. Law Offices."
3. "Of course, I had done so to place the wiretap."
4. "That is when I saw this glass light stand."

Based on what Mia (through Maya) pointed out, Mr. White claimed to have seen the glass light stand during a visit to the offices the week before the murder. However, the Receipt provides a key piece of evidence:

- The Receipt (evidence 3) for the glass light stand shows the date of purchase as 9/4, which is one day before the murder, indicating it wasn't there a week prior as White claims.

This discrepancy clearly shows that Mr. White could not have seen the glass light stand a week prior if it was purchased only the day before the murder. Thus, this presents a contradiction.

Actually, it's because I owe him a favor.Mia:\nA favor? You mean, you knew the defendant before this case?Phoenix:\nYes. Actually, I kind of owe my current job to him. He's one of the reasons I became an attorney.Mia:\nWell, that's news to me!Phoenix:\nI want to help him out any way I can! I just... really want to help him. I owe him that much.???:\n(It's over!

The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say it was you...)Phoenix:\nMy name is Phoenix Wright. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\" In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!August 3, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.

Mr. Payne?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nAs Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object.

The court accepts it into evidence. (Changed from [I see... the court accepts it into evidence.] in the original release)Statue added to the Court Record.Mia:\nWright...

I don't believe a word of it!Payne:\nYour Honor, the victim's passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.Passport added to the Court Record.Judge:\nHmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.Butz:\nDude... no way...Payne:\nThe victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several \"Sugar Daddies.\"Butz:\nDaddies? Sugar?Payne:\nYes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.Butz:\nDuuude!Payne:\nWe can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?Mia:\nWright... I don't think you want him to answer that question.Phoenix:\n(Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions.

I'm going to get to the bottom of this!Judge:\nLet's continue with the trial, shall we?Payne:\nI believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.Judge:\nYes, quite.Phoenix:\n(Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)Payne:\nNext question! You went to the victim's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?Butz:\nGulp!Payne:\nWell, did you, or did you not?Butz:\nHeh? Heh heh.

So, like, I didn't see her.\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nYour Honor, the defendant is lying.\nJudge:\nLying?\nPayne:\nThe prosecution would like to call a witness who can prove Mr. Butz is lying.\nLeads to:\n\"Well, that simplifies matters.

Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.Payne:\nYes, Your Honor.Phoenix:\n(This is bad...)Payne:\nOn the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim's building. Please bring Mr. Frank Sahwit to the stand!Payne:\nMr. Sahwit, you sell newspaper subscriptions, is this correct?Sahwit:\nOh, oh yes! Newspapers, yes!Judge:\nMr. Sahwit, you may proceed with your testimony. Please tell the court what you saw on the day of the murder.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Sahwit:\nI was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.\nI thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.\nThinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.\nThen I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!\nI quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.\nI thought to call the police immediately!\nHowever, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.\nI went to a nearby park and found a public phone.\nI remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.\nThe man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Judge:\nHmm...Phoenix:\n(Larry! Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!)Judge:\nIncidentally, why wasn't the phone in the victim's apartment working?Payne:\nYour Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.Judge:\nAren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor...

The real deal!Phoenix:\nUh... what exactly am I supposed to do?Mia:\nWhy, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!Phoenix:\nLies! What?! He was lying!?Mia:\nYour client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?Phoenix:\n!!! How do I prove he's not?Mia:\nYou hold the key! It's in the evidence! Compare the witness's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there!

Frank Sahwit (44*, Male): Witness who claims to have seen Larry flee the crime scene.
Evidence List:

Attorney's Badge: Phoenix's proof of being a defense attorney.
Cindy's Autopsy Report: Time of death: July 31, 4 PM-5 PM. Cause of death: loss of blood due to blunt trauma.
Statue: A heavy statue shaped like "The Thinker," used as the murder weapon.
Passport: Indicates Cindy returned from Paris on July 30, the day before the murder.
Blackout Record: Electricity was out from noon to 6 PM on the day of the crime in Cindy's building.
Testimonies:

Sahwit: "I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment."
Sahwit: "I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him."
Sahwit: "Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment."
Sahwit: "Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!"
Sahwit: "I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside."
Sahwit: "I thought to call the police immediately!"
Sahwit: "However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working."
Sahwit: "I went to a nearby park and found a public phone."
Sahwit: "I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM."
Sahwit: "The man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there."
Question:

During the cross-examination, identify the contradiction in the witness's testimony by presenting the appropriate evidence at the correct statement.
In this example, the witness claims to remember the time exactly as 1:00 PM, but the Cindy's Autopsy Report records the time of death between 4 PM-5 PM. This discrepancy can be presented as evidence to contradict the witness's statement.

Answer:
{
  "action": "present",
  "testimony": 9,
  "evidence": 2
}You may now present evidence that is helpful in finding a contradiction in the testimony. To present evidence, answer the question with a JSON object in the format of {"action": "present", "testimony": <number of the testimony>, "evidence": <number of the evidence>}, for example {"action": "present", "testimony": 5, "evidence": 2}.
Note that the evidence, character, and testimony is listed from 0 to n-1, so your response should be 0-indexed.
Explain your reasoning step by step before providing the JSON object. 
 Conclude your answer with "Final Answer:" followed by the JSON object on a new line.
Do not write any things after the JSON and make sure you use "Final Answer:" followed by the JSON object.

Oh, Nick! I didn't know you were here!Phoenix:
Of course I'm here! What was that surreal show you were watching?Maya:
What!? Nick, you mean, you don't know the Steel Samurai!? He's only the most popular TV hero for young people!Phoenix:
Young...? Like, how young?Maya:
Umm... 10 years old?Phoenix:
Then what the heck are YOU doing getting all excited!?Maya:
Hey! I'm only 17! That's seven-"teen." See? I'm a teen! Not like you, Nick.Phoenix:
Hey! Don't talk to me like I'm your grandpa or something. I'm only 24 myself.Maya:
Then watch it with me! He's really cool! And... it's really popular! When they asked grade school kids what they wanted to be, "Steel Samurai" was no. 1! ([no. 1] written as [no.1] in the original release)Phoenix:
I really worry about kids these days.Maya:
Gramps! Well, the Steel Samurai's over. I guess it's time to close up the office.Phoenix:
I guess... Wish we had some clients!Phoenix:

Now for the morning news. The actor Will Powers was arrested yesterday. Powers plays the lead role in the popular kid's show "The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo." He was arrested on suspicion of murder. The victim was Jack Hammer, who plays the villain known as the "Evil Magistrate." His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. The "Samurai Spear" was also found stuck through the body. Police believe this was the murder weapon, and are investigating further.Phoenix:
... This has to be a joke.Maya:
No, no, no! It's a nightmare! The Steel Samurai is over! The world is over!Cellular:

Bookshelf







Phoenix:
There's a horrendous amount of legal books here. Scarier still is the thought that I have to read all of these now.




Houseplant







Phoenix:
Mia's favorite potted plant. Maya has been watering it so much lately it looks a little... swollen. She's either trying to make it grow... or she's perfecting her water torture technique.




Movie poster







Phoenix:
A poster of an old movie that Mia liked. I was thinking I should go see it myself. Then I realized that the poster doesn't actually say the title of the movie.




Desk







Phoenix:
Mia's desk. Actually... it's my desk now. Sitting here always makes me feel like a professional.




Window







Phoenix:
It's a nice day outside. The hotel across the way is always full these days. There's the bellboy, happily cleaning the room.Talk









What to do







Phoenix:
Well, what should we do?
Maya:
What should we do!? How can you just sit there like that!? We have to get down to the detention center and meet the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
(Does she want to investigate this case or just do some sightseeing, I wonder? My money's on sightseeing.)




Any ideas







Maya:
We don't have enough information to make a case yet.
Phoenix:
Just admit it: you don't have a clue what happened.
Maya:
No! We just don't have enough information!Present

What's wrong, Maya? It's him! In the flesh!Maya:
Umm... Is that guy really him?Phoenix:
Whaddya mean "that guy"? Of course it's him! Will Powers, our client! That's him.Maya:
Um, maybe I shouldn't be saying this... But he definitely did it. Murder. At least once. Maybe twice.Phoenix:
Whoa whoa whoa! What are you saying!?Will:

Something wrong...?Maya:
N-no! No!Phoenix:
(This is getting off to a great start.)Will:
I know, I know. You're disappointed, aren't you?Maya:
D-disappointed!? Oh, no. Oh no.Will:
No, it's okay. This is the real me. When I got the part of the Steel Samurai, with that mask... I decided I would never show my face in public until the job was over. It's the kids, you know. I didn't want to wreck their dreams.Maya:
Oh...Will:
I guess it didn't matter. So much for dreams. I wonder what they think of the Steel Samurai now. *sniff* Uwaaah!Maya:

Security camera







Phoenix:
Smile for the camera...




Security guard







Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He seems frozen in awe of Will Powers.Talk









What happened







Phoenix:
Maybe you could start by telling us what happened.
Will:
Y-yes. Of course. It seems like it was only yesterday. Actually, it was only yesterday. The cast had come down to Global Studios for a run-through. We went through a few action sequences at 10:00 that morning. There was a rehearsal scheduled for 5:00 in the afternoon. But when 5:00 came around, and the staff gathered at the studio... The Evil Magistrate was found lying in a crumpled heap near the set. They took off his mask... And discovered that it was Jack Hammer... dead! He had been expertly skewered with the Samurai Spear.
Phoenix:
The "Samurai Spear"...?
Will:
Yes, it's a long spear that I... that the Steel Samurai uses as a weapon.




The Steel Samurai







Phoenix:
Maybe you could explain to me just what "the Steel Samurai" is.
Maya:
Nick! How could you say such a thing? I-I'm sorry, sir, I apologize for my partner! He's new to this, and a bit OUT OF TOUCH with the world.
Phoenix:
Hey! Who's "new to this"!?
Will:
No, it's alright, really. The Steel Samurai is the lead character in a popular kid's show. He walks the streets of Neo Olde Tokyo... Fighting battle after battle against the Evil Magistrate and his minions. Of course, he never really defeats the Evil Magistrate. Although... I guess he did defeat him this time... *sniff* Uwaaah!
Phoenix:
I-I see. (Neo Olde Tokyo...? Who comes up with these names!?)




Powers's alibi (appears after "What happened")







Phoenix:
Now, where were you on the day of the murder?
Will:
Well, that morning I came to studios at 9:00. We worked through some action scenes until noon. Rehearsal was to begin at 5:00, but I was a little tired. So after lunch, I took a nap in my dressing room. When I woke up, it was after 5:00! I was late for the rehearsal! I hurried to the studio... and found everyone looking shocked. They arrested me on the spot, and brought me here.
Phoenix:
(So he was sleeping the entire afternoon of the murder? Some action hero!)
Will:
What will the kids think? *sniff*Present

Oh yeah? Well that's great. I'm security! And it's my job to make sure that gawkers like you stay OUT.Maya:
G-gawkers?Oldbag:
Gawkers! Sightseers! Tourists!!! I know the type. You heard about the incident and came to snoop around. Youths today! Something horrible happens and all you can think of is sightseeing. Wasting your time at a place like this. Don't you have jobs you should be doing? Or do lawyers not work like the rest of us? Maybe I should become a lawyer too. Sounds like a life of ease to me no work just loafing around all day as you please. Well when I was young things were a mite different, mind you we didn't prance around in strange hippie clothes. What are the youths coming to these days my own son hasn't called in...Maya:
Umm... Nick? Will I grow up to be like her? Please say "no."Phoenix:

Computer







Phoenix:
The computer that runs the studio security cameras.
Oldbag:
Hey! No touching!




Guard station







Phoenix:
The security guard station. That security lady must like junk food. There's a mountain of it on the desk in there. I can see the computer that runs the security cameras.




Main gate







Phoenix:
The main entrance to the studio. There was a big scene here yesterday with onlookers pressing up against the gate.




Studio map







Phoenix:
An overhead map of the studios. Right from here is the Employee Area. To the left are the actual film studios.




Studio van







Phoenix:
Looks like a studio van. They probably use it to carry around film equipment.Talk









The studios







Phoenix:
So, what do you do here at the studios?
Oldbag:
At Global Studios, we make children's dreams come true! In fact, in my younger days...
Maya:
No! You were a star!?
Oldbag:
Only a little twinkle between the stars here, I'm afraid, dearie.
Maya:
Wo... wow.
Oldbag:
This place has really gone downhill, you know? But 10 years ago, now that was a studio of dreams! Hammer was a big star back then too, he was...
Phoenix:
Hammer...?
Oldbag:
The victim, dummy! The Evil Magistrate! He's been reduced to playing villains now. Not exactly the best material to work with...




Will Powers







Phoenix:
Can you tell me about Mr. Will Powers?
Oldbag:
He's not a bad kid, but don't be fooled by his mask! You wouldn't want him on the silver screen without it, believe me. Little old ladies watching would lose their lunch! That's probably why he thought that the Steel Samurai was his "big chance." No one thought he was capable of doing what he did to poor Jack Hammer...
Maya:
We don't know for certain that Will Powers is guilty!
Oldbag:
Powers? Of course he's guilty! How do I know? I know everything! That's my job.




Mr. Hammer (appears after "The studios")







Phoenix:
What kind of person was Jack Hammer?
Oldbag:
What "kind of person"? Oh... if you only knew! Jack Hammer will live on in many hearts as the ultimate action hero! He was simply dashing in the Dynamite Samurai series!
Phoenix:
(Should I have heard of that...?)
Oldbag:
But... there was an accident during filming five years ago. He got an unlucky break after that. Reduced to playing the villain on a children's program! What's more, I heard they were paying him peanuts. It's enough to make you cry.




Reason for suspicion (appears after "Will Powers")







Phoenix:
Why are you so certain Mr. Powers is the killer?
Oldbag:
I was standing right here yesterday, I was. I was here from 1:00 in the afternoon, to 5:00, when they found the body! Now the studio where the murder took place is to the left here. So if you want to go to the studio, you have to pass by me! Only one person went by here between 1:00 and 2:30, when the murder took place!
Phoenix:
And... that person was Mr. Powers?
Oldbag:
Yes. I saw him!
Phoenix:
But Mr. Powers says he was sleeping in his dressing room.
Oldbag:
Oh, I'm sure he would say that. He's no fool! But he was the only one that walked by. He's the killer, you can bet your biscuits on it.Present

Your alibi







Phoenix:
Mr. Powers, you aren't hiding anything from me, are you?
Will:
W-what? No! I'd never do that!
Phoenix:
Just now you said that you were sleeping in your dressing room after lunch.
Will:
Yes. Like a baby.
Phoenix:
But the security lady said she saw you that day. She says she saw you heading towards the scene of the crime!
Will:
W-what!? That's not possible! I... I really don't know what to say! I was sleeping, I promise!
Phoenix:
Mr. Powers, if you want me to help you, you have to tell me the truth. I'm new to this lawyer business, and I need every advantage I can get.
Will:
I know... I-I'm sorry. *sniff* But, I swear to you on my momma's grave, I was sleeping. Maybe the security lady only thought she saw me?
Phoenix:
(What did she see...? He doesn't seem to be lying.)




The security lady







Phoenix:
Umm... about the security guard at the main gate to the studio...
Will:
Oh, the security lady?
Maya:
She's terrible! She called me "suspicious lookin'"!
Will:
Y-yes... actually, she's said the same thing to me before. "Take off that mask!" were her words, I believe. She sucks up to all the bigwigs at the studio... But let her see you stumble once and she'll never let up on you.
Maya:
Grr! She's got some nerve!
Phoenix:
Do you think you could write up a letter formally requesting my representation?
Will:
Of c-course.
Powers's Request added to the Court Record.

Bench







Phoenix:
I'm a little bushed. Maybe I'll take a short rest here.
Gumshoe:
Hey, good idea, pal!
Maya:
Detective! Aren't you on the case?
Gumshoe:
W-well, yeah, but... Hey, us detectives get tired of standing around too, pal!




Left path







Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe, what's down the path to the left? It looks like a tree fell down over the path...?
Gumshoe:
Oh, yeah. That way's kind of dangerous. You should stay out, pal. There's nothing down there, anyway. That's where Studio Two used to be, they tell me. They don't use it now, though.




Statue with broken head







Phoenix:
The studio mascot. I guess it's a monkey of some kind. But what kind of monkey has a nose like that? He's holding a sign in his hand. [Right: To Studio One; Left: To Studio Two]
Maya:
What's up with that thing!? It looks kind of... busted.
Gumshoe:
Oh, the wind was pretty strong yesterday, and the head broke off. It took that tree down with it, too.




Security camera







Phoenix:
Hey, there's a camera here.
Gumshoe:
That's the security camera. It takes photos of people going to the studio. All you have to do is look at the data and you can see who went where!
Phoenix:
There's a number plate on the camera... [ST1-307]. That must be the camera ID number.




Studio One entrance







Phoenix:
The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.
Maya:
Let's go in and check it out, Nick! ... Hey! It's locked!
Phoenix:
Looks like you need a cardkey to get in. It makes sense that they would want to keep the non-employees out.




Welcome sign







Maya:
There's a big welcome sign above the path.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, apparently the studio's fallen on tough times. They've started letting people in on days they aren't filming. They make a bit of extra money by charging for admission.
Maya:
Huh. You sure know a lot about this place, Detective. You know, you could always quit being a detective and work here?
Phoenix:
Yeah! And what perfect timing, with the monkey's neck broken and all.
Gumshoe:
Huh? Just what's that supposed to mean, pal!?Talk









The investigation







Phoenix:
So, how is your investigation going, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Well, it's... Hey! I can't tell you that, pal.
Maya:
Nick... Maybe you need to be a little more indirect with your questions?
Phoenix:
Right. So, Detective, mind if I take a look at what you got?
Gumshoe:
What I got?
Phoenix:
The autopsy report! The latest version, if you please...
Gumshoe:
Hmm... right, right. Sorry about what happened last time, pal.
Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.




The investigation (subsequent times)







Phoenix:
So, how is your investigation going, Detective?
Gumshoe:
I'm not at liberty to give you any more information, pal. You'll hear all you need to know in court!
Phoenix:
(Oh well, it was worth a try.)




Reason for arrest







Phoenix:
Why was Mr. Powers arrested?
Gumshoe:
Simple, pal! The murder took place right over there in Studio One. Now, the victim entered Studio One at approximately 1:00 PM. At that time, there was no one other than the victim in the studio. According to the autopsy report, the time of death was 2:30 PM. Only one person went to the studio between 1:00 and 2:30! And that person was none other than Will Powers! No one else, pal! If you think I'm lying, ask the security lady at the main gate.
Maya:
Nick! If that's true...! Anyone would think that Powers did it with that kind of evidence!
Phoenix:
Thanks for cheering me up...




The security lady







Phoenix:
About the security lady...
Gumshoe:
Oh, that sweet old lady. What a charmer!
Phoenix:
Huh? A-are we talking about the same person?
Gumshoe:
When I showed her my badge she gave me a donut and some coffee!
Maya:
Remember what Powers said. She's a sucker for authority.
Gumshoe:
She even gave me a piece of valuable evidence!
Maya:
Whaat!?




Decisive evidence (appears after "The security lady")







Phoenix:
What kind of evidence!?
Gumshoe:
Well, that, er, photo. The photo of the Steel Samurai heading toward the scene of the crime!
Maya:
What! Who took that!?
Gumshoe:
See the camera up on that gate, pal?
Maya:
The gate? You mean the one with the welcome sign?
Gumshoe:
Yeah. Whenever someone walks by, that camera automatically snaps a photo of them!
Maya:
Oh no! Nick, he has evidence! We're finished!
Phoenix:
(Funny, for someone with hard proof he doesn't look too happy.)
Gumshoe:

Attorney's Badge







Phoenix:
Detective, see this? This is my attorney's badge.
Gumshoe:
Uh huh? Don'tcha think it's a little sad when you have to explain what your badge means, pal? Real men show their P.D. badge and that's that!
Phoenix:
I'll admit the design of my badge leaves a lot to be desired...
Maya:
Maybe it should just be a big "L" for "Lawyer"?
Phoenix:
Hmm... I'm not so sure about that.




Anything else







Phoenix:
Um, Detective. Any ideas about this?
Gumshoe:
Look, I don't got time to look at every little trinket you got, okay pal?After clearing "The investigation" and "Decisive evidence" Talk options:Gumshoe:

(Urk! She had to make my life harder by giving that photo to Detective Gumshoe...)Talk









Photographic proof







Phoenix:
Why didn't you tell us about the security photo, ma'am?
Oldbag:
Hmm? Oh, that? I just thought it would be more thrilling to talk with the detective himself! These things are important, you know. Oh, just to the left from here is the gate with the camera that took that photo. It's my job to check the photos every day, you see.




Reason for suspicion







Oldbag:
This guard station is in a central position. No matter where you go here, you pass by my station first! Now poor Hammer, he went to the studio just before 1:00. The murder happened right around 2:30, see? The only one I seen go through here between 1:00 and 2:30 was Powers himself! The security camera got a good look at him too. If he's not the one what did it, I don't know who is!
Phoenix:
Maybe... it was you?
Oldbag:
Gyah hah ha hah! Good one, sonny.
Phoenix:
(She thinks I was joking.)




Mr. Hammer







Phoenix:
Was the victim, Mr. Hammer, a popular actor?
Oldbag:
Oh, he was the biggest star in the studio!
Phoenix:
("Was"? Past tense?)
Maya:
Oh yes! He was great as the "Bearded Samurai"!
Oldbag:
That too, yes. He shone the brightest! Back in the day. Making a star like him play the "Evil Magistrate"... It's a disgrace, I tell you! Hammer took it pretty hard, and who can blame him?




Automatic camera (appears after "Photographic proof")







Phoenix:
About the security camera...
Oldbag:
Oh yes, the camera. It's automatic. It can tell when someone walks through that gate, see? Then it snaps a photo! Apparently, it records the time when it takes a picture too. But I don't bother myself with those details. I just view all the photos on the computer over in the security guard station. I check 'em every day before going home, I do.October 16Wright & Co. Law OfficesMaya:
What's going on, Nick!? Powers said he was sleeping in his dressing room! But now there's a photo of him going to the studio!?Phoenix:
Don't look at me! How should I know?Talk









What to do







Phoenix:
What do you think?
Maya:
That photo the detective was talking about is the problem here.
Phoenix:
Well, that's hard to say, without seeing the actual photo ourselves. But if it is Powers in that photo, his alibi is shot.




Photographic proof







Phoenix:
Only one person went to the scene of the crime before the murder took place. And there's a photograph to prove it.
Maya:
I guess it makes sense that that person is the killer then. What do we do, Nick?
Phoenix:
Maybe there was someone else who could have gone to the scene other than Powers? Let's take a look. Maybe that security lady missed someone?
Maya:
On thing's for sure, if there are any clues, they'll be in that studio.October 16Detention CenterVisitor's RoomPhoenix:
...Maya:
Apparently they have Mr. Powers in questioning.Phoenix:
Hmm... right.Gumshoe:
Look pal, that camera takes a picture automatically whenever someone walks by. And it took a picture of Will Powers!Phoenix:
I have to ask him about that photograph!Maya:
Oh well. Let's try again later.Examine









Security guard







Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He must get pretty bored. I bet he's making funny faces at that camera.October 16Global StudiosEmployee AreaMaya:
Nick! This is where they do all the behind-the-scenes stuff! Hey! Look! There's Powers's dressing room! No one's here this soon after the murder I guess. Let's take a look around!Examine









Bicycle







Phoenix:
Looks like one of those electric-powered bicycles. I dunno about these. I mean, what's the point?
Maya:
It makes it a lot easier to go up hills!
Phoenix:
Don't people cycle to get exercise!?




Drain grate







Phoenix:
The metal grate on the drain here has been taken off. That's a pretty big drain. A kid could fit through there, I bet.
Maya:
Yeah, if you snuck in that way you wouldn't have to pay at the gate!
Phoenix:
Well, if you want to leave that way, be my guest.
Maya:
Right! Huh? Hey! I'm not a kid!




Grate







Phoenix:
The grate that used to cover the drain. It's a little bent. I don't think it would fit if I tried to put it back on.




Lunch table







Phoenix:
The remains of yesterday's lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak.
Maya:
Mmm! T-bone steak! That would have hit the spot.
Phoenix:
You just had a burger!
Maya:
Yeah, but I have a second stomach just for steaks.
Phoenix:
(What!?)




Stage backdrop







Phoenix:
There's a half-finished backdrop for a stage here. Looks like a castle. Probably "Neo Olde Tokyo Castle."




Dressing room door







Phoenix:
The door to the dressing room. It's not locked.
Maya:
Hey, Nick! Let's take a look inside! Maybe we can find something as a souvenir...?
Phoenix:
What do you mean "find"!?
Maya:
You never know! There might be something like... the Samurai Spear!
Phoenix:
We don't need a spear! (And that's the murder weapon for crying out loud!)




Dressing room sign







Phoenix:
There's a sign on the dressing room door. "Mr. Will Powers"... it must be neat to be the star and have your own room like this.




Dressing room window







Phoenix:
A window into the dressing room. The glass is frosted, so I can't see inside.




Storage room door







Phoenix:
That must be the storage room. That's where they keep all the film equipment.
Maya:
Wow, Nick! You know a lot about the industry!
Phoenix:
Umm, what else would they keep in a film studio?




Vending machine







Phoenix:
Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks or something. Popcorn, at least!
Maya:
W-wait! Look! "Samurai Soda"! Nick! Try this!

No one actually saw him taking a nap here, did they?Phoenix:
Right, and there's a picture of him near the crime scene. (I hope he's telling the truth... for his sake!)Examine









Cosmetics







Phoenix:
There's a vast array of cosmetics here.
Maya:
Ooh! This is the wig he used in "Samurai Boogey-Woogey"! Nick! Try this on!
Phoenix:
No. And how can you tell the name of a show just by looking at a wig!?
Maya:
I, um, kinda like samurai movies.
Phoenix:
("Kinda"...?)




Costume rack







Phoenix:
There's some regular suits in among the costumes here. Those must be his own clothes.
Maya:
It'd be fun to wear one of the costumes...
Phoenix:
(I'd say you were already wearing one, myself.)




Couch







Phoenix:
Looks like someone was sleeping here. Maybe Powers did take a nap here yesterday...




Mirror







Phoenix:
They always have mirrors like this in dressing rooms. I see my hair is still nice and spiky, just how I like it.




Bag







Maya:
Hmm? This must be Powers's bag.
Phoenix:
Hey, don't open that.
Maya:
Look!
Phoenix:
An employee cardkey. That must be Powers's. It says "Studio One."
Maya:
Let's take it, Nick!
Phoenix:
Borrow it. You mean borrow.
Cardkey added to the Court Record.




Bag (subsequent times)







Maya:
I wonder what else is inside Powers's bag...?
Phoenix:
Stop that! (My partner, the thief in training.)




Table







Phoenix:
There's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Some tea and cookies...
Maya:
Nick... I'm hungry!
Phoenix:
You just had a burger!
Maya:
Yeah, but I have a separate stomach for sweets!
Phoenix:
(How many stomachs does this girl have!?)

Oh that! Isn't that a studio cardkey? You better watch it! The scene of a murder is no place for sightseeing! I'll be taking that! Hand it over!
Phoenix:
W-wait! No, that's mine!

Director's chair







Maya:
Hey! Look! That's the chair the director sits in! I've always wanted to sit in one of these. Hey Nick, take a look at that. One of those black-and-white boards they clap at the start of filming! And look! A megaphone! A real live megaphone!

That's for reflecting light. They call it a reflecting screen or something like that. The assistant holds it during filming.
Maya:
Huh.
Phoenix:
What? Where's your enthusiasm for all things entertainment?
Maya:
Well, lighting is fine, but I'd want to be the director. Or maybe the Steel Samurai!

Looks like a backdrop for a stage. This must be used in the Steel Samurai show.

Of course! That's the mountain, Neo Fujiyama!

Doesn't the Steel Samurai take place in Olde Tokyo? Can you even see Mt. Fuji from there?

Not Olde Tokyo, Nick! "Neo" Olde Tokyo!

Phoenix:
R-right... sorry. (This girl is OUT there!)




Tape outline







Phoenix:
They outlined where Jack Hammer's body lay with tape. His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. I guess that's why the head part looks like a helmet. Funny, I expected a spear stabbing would leave at least a few bloodstains. I guess the costume must have absorbed most of it...Maya:
Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!Phoenix:
Yeah! So don't touch it!Maya:
Whoa! It's heavier than I thought...???:

The day of the crime







Phoenix:
Could you tell me anything about the day of the murder?
Penny:
Yes. I was in the studio the whole day. I was the only assistant on staff that day, you see.
Maya:
Only one assistant!?
Penny:
Yes, well, the studios isn't doing so well right now. (Changed from [Yes, well, the studios aren't doing so well right now.] in the original release) And yesterday was only rehearsal for our action sequences.
Maya:
Oh, I see. (Changed from [I see. Neat!] in the original release)
Penny:
In the morning we went through the action sequences in the employee area. WP and Hammer were there, along with everyone else.
Phoenix:
The employee area--that's where Powers's dressing room is, right?
Penny:
Yes, that's the place. After eating lunch there, Mr. Hammer went to Studio One. Then I saw WP go into his dressing room. But I didn't see either of them after that.




Will Powers







Phoenix:
Did you know that Mr. Powers was sleeping in his room?
Penny:
No! I wouldn't go in there unless I had some urgent message for him... I mean, it's his private... What kind of a girl do you think I am!?

Sorry... I... don't really want to think too much about what happened just yet.After clearing all Talk options:Maya:
What do we do, Nick? We haven't found anything. If WP was the only one who came to the studio... Then he has to be the killer! They even have a photograph...Phoenix:

Not really.Penny:
Actually, there's been something bothering me.Maya:
Ah hah! That's what I'm talking about! A clue! A lead!Penny:
Well, I don't know about that, but that day, just after noon, I sensed someone was here...Phoenix:
You "sensed"?Penny:
Yes, several times.Phoenix:
Some other studio employees, maybe?Penny:
No, I don't think so. The only thing we had scheduled was an action scene run-through. I was the only assistant here that day. I have a feeling it was someone from... outside.Phoenix:
R-really!?Maya:
But wait, if someone had come in here... Wouldn't that security lady have noticed them?Phoenix:
Yeah, you're right.Penny:
I'm sorry I don't have any better information than that.Maya:
No, thanks! That helps us a lot. Anything helps. Let's go put that security lady on the spot!Talk

So you sensed that someone other than the regular film crew was in the studio?

What? I saw that suspicious look on your face!Phoenix:
I wanted to ask you again about yesterday... You came here at 1:00 PM, correct? And the estimated time of Hammer's death was 2:30. Are you sure that Powers was the only one to go through here between those times?Oldbag:
Sure as can be!Maya:

Okay. Let's give it a try.

Part 6October 18, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:
Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth:
The prosecution will show the court that at 2:30 PM on October 15, the defendant, Mr. Will Powers, killed fellow actor Jack Hammer at Studio One of Global Studios. It is impossible for anyone else to have committed this heinous crime. The evidence presented during the trial will all point to this fact.Judge:
Hmm. I see. Very well, I would like to move on to your testimony. Mr. Edgeworth, the prosecution may call its first witness.Edgeworth:
Very well, I call a most familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand. (Changed from [First, I would like to call a familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand.] in the original release)Edgeworth:
Detective, if you would briefly describe this case to the court?Gumshoe:
Yes sir! I'll explain with the guidemap here. To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see? This here is the Employee Area. The actors did a run-through of their action scenes during the morning here. This is the main gate to the studios. The security lady that works at the studios was here at 1:00 PM on that day. Past the security station there is a gate, see? Past that are the studios. And here it is... Studio One. This is the scene of the murder, where the body was found! Now, on the day of the murder, October 15, there were only three people here. The victim, Jack Hammer, the defendant, Will Powers, and a young woman, the production assistant. All the production staff were in the Employee Area until noon. Then after lunch, the victim, Jack Hammer, went to Studio One. Right after that, at 1:00 PM, the security lady got to the guard station. Now, jump ahead to later that day... 5:00 PM. The production staff came to Studio One to perform a rehearsal. Needless to say, the rehearsal was cancelled... The time of death was 2:30 PM. The "Samurai Spear" found lodged in the victim's chest was the murder weapon. That's the case, in brief. Anyone like to hear that again?Phoenix:
(Hmm... should I listen to that whole thing again...?)Skip it







Leads to:
"I think I can probably remember that..."Listen again







Phoenix:
I'm sorry, could you describe that one more time?
Gumshoe:
I shoulda known it would be you, pal! Fine. Once more for the mentally-challenged lawyer.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, yeah. Live it up while you can, Gumshoe.)
Leads back to:
"To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see?"Phoenix:
(I think I can probably remember that...)Judge:
So the murder weapon was a "spear"? How... medieval!Samurai Spear added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:
Your Honor. This case is quite simple if you ask one question: And that question is: "What did the security lady at the guard station see?"Judge:
Understood.Edgeworth:
Let's call this security officer to the stand!Edgeworth:
Will the witness declare her name?Oldbag:
... Hmm? My, aren't you a handsome fellow! I'm afraid I'm a bit flustered!Edgeworth:
Y-your name, please!Oldbag:
Oh, dearie! No need for you to be embarrassed! Just call me "grandma."Edgeworth:
YOUR NAME, PLEASE!Phoenix:
(Seems Edgeworth has a bit of trouble getting his witnesses to say their names...)Oldbag:
Wendy Oldbag, dearie. So just call me "grandma." It's practically my name! So even when I was young I was an Oldbag, but not really that was just my name dearie. Still how the other children would make fun of me and just because of my name can you believe it? But there was this boy, the captain of the chess club in junior high, and when he called me an old bag well I just cried and cried because I had a crush on him you see--Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
O-objection! I... object to the witness's talkativeness.Judge:
Objection sustained! The witness will refrain from rambling on the stand.Oldbag:
I was just getting to the good part, dearie!Edgeworth:
Perhaps we can get to the testimony?Judge:
Now, the witness was stationed at the main gate on the day of the murder, correct?Oldbag:
Yessey I was.Judge:
And to get to the scene of the murder, someone would have to pass by you?Oldbag:
You know your stuff, dearie!Judge:
... You may begin your testimony.Phoenix:
(She sure is one hell of an Oldbag...)Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Oldbag:
On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.
Poor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.
I, well, I had some errands to run that morning.
Anyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.
I was at the main gate from then until 5:00!
Now, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?
Interesting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.
It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!Judge:
You saw the defendant, then? Hmm... Very well. Let's begin the cross-examination. Mr. Wright?Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.Cross Examination

2025-01-22 14:44:00,047 - INFO - HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2025-01-22 14:44:00,050 - INFO - Assistant reply: To find a contradiction in the testimony of the security guard, Wendy Oldbag, let's evaluate her statements and compare them with the evidence available.

1. Oldbag claims she arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM. This matches with other testimonies and the timeline.

2. She mentions that Jack Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through since the morning, which aligns with known facts.

3. She states she was at the main gate from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. The murder happened at 2:30 PM, so she should have seen anyone who passed by.

4. The critical part of her testimony is that she saw someone at 2:00 PM, which she claims was Powers heading toward the studio.

Now, let's evaluate the evidence:

- The time of death according to the Autopsy Report is 2:30 PM, which aligns with her testimony.

- However, there is a significant piece of evidence called "Powers's(?) Photo." This evidence indicates that at 2:00 PM, a person wearing the Steel Samurai costume was captured on camera walking towards the studio. The key detail here is that the person in the costume is dragging one leg, which is a crucial point.

- Will Powers claims he was sleeping in his dressing room at this time, thus he has an alibi. Moreover, the photo provides evidence that the person in the Steel Samurai costume could be someone else other than Powers, considering his reliance on an alibi and the fact he might not have been dragging his leg.

The discrepancy lies in Oldbag's certainty that it was Will Powers who she saw at 2:00 PM. The photo evidence suggests a possibility that it was not Powers himself, but someone else wearing the costume due to the dragging foot.

This suggests a contradiction:

- Testimony: "It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!" from testimony point 7.

- Evidence contradicting: "Powers's(?) Photo" (Evidence #5) shows the person in costume, but it might not be Powers due to the costume's dragging leg, creating reasonable doubt.

Well, I have to say Phoenix, I'm impressed! Not everyone takes on a murder trial right off the bat like this. It says a lot about you... and your client as well.Phoenix:\nUm... thanks. Actually, it's because I owe him a favor.Mia:\nA favor? You mean, you knew the defendant before this case?Phoenix:\nYes. Actually, I kind of owe my current job to him. He's one of the reasons I became an attorney.Mia:\nWell, that's news to me!Phoenix:\nI want to help him out any way I can! I just... really want to help him. I owe him that much.???:\n(It's over! My life, everything, it's all over!)Mia:\n... Is that your client screaming over there?

The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say it was you...)Phoenix:\nMy name is Phoenix Wright. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\" In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!August 3, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz. (Changed from [The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.] in the original release)Payne:\nThe prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:\nThe, um, defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:\nAhem.

Well, that's Larry Butz, Your Honor.Judge:\nCorrect. Just keep your wits about you and you'll do fine. Next question: This is a murder trial. Tell me, what's the victim's name?Phoenix:\n(Whew, I know this one! Glad I read the case report cover to cover so many times. It's... wait... Uh-oh! No... no way! I forgot! I'm drawing a total blank here!)Mia:\nPhoenix! Are you absolutely SURE you're up to this? You don't even know the victim's name!?Phoenix:\nOh, the victim! O-Of course I know the victim's name! I, um, just forgot. ...Temporarily (Changed from [I, um, just forgot. ... Temporarily.] in the original release)Mia:\nI think I feel a migraine coming on.

You've answered all my questions. I see no reason why we shouldn't proceed. You seem much more relaxed, Mr. Wright. Good for you.Phoenix:\nThank you, Your Honor. (Because I don't FEEL relaxed, that's for sure.)Judge:\nWell, then... First, a question for the prosecution. Mr. Payne?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nAs Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to the court just what that \"object\" was?Payne:\nThe murder weapon was this statue of \"The Thinker.\" It was found lying on the floor, next to the victim.Judge:\nI see... The court accepts it into evidence. (Changed from [I see... the court accepts it into evidence.] in the original release)Statue added to the Court Record.Mia:\nWright...

WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?Payne:\nMr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by \"dumped.\" In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!Butz:\nWhaddya mean, \"one of them\"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!Payne:\nYour Honor, the victim's passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.Passport added to the Court Record.Judge:\nHmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.Butz:\nDude... no way...Payne:\nThe victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several \"Sugar Daddies.\"Butz:\nDaddies? Sugar?Payne:\nYes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.Butz:\nDuuude!Payne:\nWe can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?Mia:\nWright... I don't think you want him to answer that question.Phoenix:\n(Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)Wait and see what happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Might be better not to get involved in this one...)\nPayne:\nWell, Mr. Butz?\nButz:\nDude, no way!

That question is irrelevant to this case!\nPayne:\nOof! *wince*\nButz:\nDude! Nick! Whaddya mean, \"irrelevant\"!? That cheatin' she-dog!\nLeads to:\n\"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!\"Butz:\nI'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I'm going to get to the bottom of this!Judge:\nLet's continue with the trial, shall we?Payne:\nI believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.Judge:\nYes, quite.Phoenix:\n(Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)Payne:\nNext question! You went to the victim's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?Butz:\nGulp!Payne:\nWell, did you, or did you not?Butz:\nHeh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn't!Phoenix:\n(Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)Have him answer honestly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I know!

So, like, I didn't see her.\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nYour Honor, the defendant is lying.\nJudge:\nLying?\nPayne:\nThe prosecution would like to call a witness who can prove Mr. Butz is lying.\nLeads to:\n\"Well, that simplifies matters.

Well then, we'll just have to remind you!\nPhoenix:\n(I got a bad feeling about this...)\nPayne:\nWe have a witness that can prove he DID go to the victim's apartment that day!\nLeads to:\n\"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?\"Judge:\nWell, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?Payne:\nThe man who found the victim's body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw the defendant fleeing the scene of the crime!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.Payne:\nYes, Your Honor.Phoenix:\n(This is bad...)Payne:\nOn the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim's building.

A woman... not moving... dead!\nI quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.\nI thought to call the police immediately!\nHowever, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.\nI went to a nearby park and found a public phone.\nI remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.\nThe man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Judge:\nHmm...Phoenix:\n(Larry! Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!)Judge:\nIncidentally, why wasn't the phone in the victim's apartment working?Payne:\nYour Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.Judge:\nAren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.Blackout Record added to the Court Record.Judge:\nNow, Mr. Wright...Phoenix:\nYes! Er... yes, Your Honor?Judge:\nYou may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:\nC-Cross-examination, Your Honor?Mia:\nAlright, Wright, this is it. The real deal!Phoenix:\nUh... what exactly am I supposed to do?Mia:\nWhy, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!Phoenix:\nLies! What?! He was lying!?Mia:\nYour client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?Phoenix:\n!!! How do I prove he's not?Mia:\nYou hold the key! It's in the evidence! Compare the witness's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there! First, find contradictions between the Court Record and the witness's testimony. Then, once you've found the contradicting evidence... present it and rub it in the witness's face!Phoenix:\nUm... okay.Mia:\nOpen the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab], then point out contradictions in the testimony! (Changed from [Touch the Court Record button and point out contradictions in the testimony!] in the original release)Cross Examination"

During the cross-examination, identify the contradiction in the witness's testimony by presenting the appropriate evidence at the correct statement.
In this example, the witness claims to remember the time exactly as 1:00 PM, but the Cindy's Autopsy Report records the time of death between 4 PM-5 PM. This discrepancy can be presented as evidence to contradict the witness's statement.

Answer:
{
  "action": "present",
  "testimony": 9,
  "evidence": 2
}You may now present evidence that is helpful in finding a contradiction in the testimony. To present evidence, answer the question with a JSON object in the format of {"action": "present", "testimony": <number of the testimony>, "evidence": <number of the evidence>}, for example {"action": "present", "testimony": 5, "evidence": 2}.
Note that the evidence, character, and testimony is listed from 0 to n-1, so your response should be 0-indexed.

Now for the morning news. The actor Will Powers was arrested yesterday. Powers plays the lead role in the popular kid's show "The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo." He was arrested on suspicion of murder. The victim was Jack Hammer, who plays the villain known as the "Evil Magistrate." His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. The "Samurai Spear" was also found stuck through the body. Police believe this was the murder weapon, and are investigating further.Phoenix:

What to do

Well, what should we do?

What should we do!? How can you just sit there like that!? We have to get down to the detention center and meet the Steel Samurai!

What happened







Phoenix:
Maybe you could start by telling us what happened.
Will:
Y-yes. Of course. It seems like it was only yesterday. Actually, it was only yesterday. The cast had come down to Global Studios for a run-through. We went through a few action sequences at 10:00 that morning. There was a rehearsal scheduled for 5:00 in the afternoon. But when 5:00 came around, and the staff gathered at the studio... The Evil Magistrate was found lying in a crumpled heap near the set. They took off his mask... And discovered that it was Jack Hammer... dead! He had been expertly skewered with the Samurai Spear.
Phoenix:
The "Samurai Spear"...?
Will:
Yes, it's a long spear that I... that the Steel Samurai uses as a weapon.




The Steel Samurai







Phoenix:
Maybe you could explain to me just what "the Steel Samurai" is.
Maya:
Nick! How could you say such a thing? I-I'm sorry, sir, I apologize for my partner! He's new to this, and a bit OUT OF TOUCH with the world.
Phoenix:
Hey! Who's "new to this"!?
Will:
No, it's alright, really. The Steel Samurai is the lead character in a popular kid's show. He walks the streets of Neo Olde Tokyo... Fighting battle after battle against the Evil Magistrate and his minions. Of course, he never really defeats the Evil Magistrate. Although... I guess he did defeat him this time... *sniff* Uwaaah!
Phoenix:
I-I see. (Neo Olde Tokyo...? Who comes up with these names!?)




Powers's alibi (appears after "What happened")







Phoenix:
Now, where were you on the day of the murder?
Will:
Well, that morning I came to studios at 9:00. We worked through some action scenes until noon. Rehearsal was to begin at 5:00, but I was a little tired. So after lunch, I took a nap in my dressing room. When I woke up, it was after 5:00! I was late for the rehearsal! I hurried to the studio... and found everyone looking shocked. They arrested me on the spot, and brought me here.
Phoenix:

The studios







Phoenix:
So, what do you do here at the studios?
Oldbag:
At Global Studios, we make children's dreams come true! In fact, in my younger days...
Maya:
No! You were a star!?
Oldbag:
Only a little twinkle between the stars here, I'm afraid, dearie.
Maya:
Wo... wow.
Oldbag:
This place has really gone downhill, you know? But 10 years ago, now that was a studio of dreams! Hammer was a big star back then too, he was...
Phoenix:
Hammer...?
Oldbag:
The victim, dummy! The Evil Magistrate! He's been reduced to playing villains now. Not exactly the best material to work with...




Will Powers







Phoenix:
Can you tell me about Mr. Will Powers?
Oldbag:
He's not a bad kid, but don't be fooled by his mask! You wouldn't want him on the silver screen without it, believe me. Little old ladies watching would lose their lunch! That's probably why he thought that the Steel Samurai was his "big chance." No one thought he was capable of doing what he did to poor Jack Hammer...
Maya:
We don't know for certain that Will Powers is guilty!
Oldbag:
Powers? Of course he's guilty! How do I know? I know everything! That's my job.




Mr. Hammer (appears after "The studios")







Phoenix:
What kind of person was Jack Hammer?
Oldbag:
What "kind of person"? Oh... if you only knew! Jack Hammer will live on in many hearts as the ultimate action hero! He was simply dashing in the Dynamite Samurai series!
Phoenix:
(Should I have heard of that...?)
Oldbag:
But... there was an accident during filming five years ago. He got an unlucky break after that. Reduced to playing the villain on a children's program! What's more, I heard they were paying him peanuts. It's enough to make you cry.




Reason for suspicion (appears after "Will Powers")







Phoenix:
Why are you so certain Mr. Powers is the killer?
Oldbag:
I was standing right here yesterday, I was. I was here from 1:00 in the afternoon, to 5:00, when they found the body! Now the studio where the murder took place is to the left here. So if you want to go to the studio, you have to pass by me! Only one person went by here between 1:00 and 2:30, when the murder took place!
Phoenix:
And... that person was Mr. Powers?
Oldbag:
Yes. I saw him!
Phoenix:
But Mr. Powers says he was sleeping in his dressing room.

Your alibi







Phoenix:
Mr. Powers, you aren't hiding anything from me, are you?
Will:
W-what? No! I'd never do that!
Phoenix:
Just now you said that you were sleeping in your dressing room after lunch.
Will:
Yes. Like a baby.
Phoenix:
But the security lady said she saw you that day. She says she saw you heading towards the scene of the crime!
Will:
W-what!? That's not possible! I... I really don't know what to say! I was sleeping, I promise!
Phoenix:
Mr. Powers, if you want me to help you, you have to tell me the truth. I'm new to this lawyer business, and I need every advantage I can get.
Will:
I know... I-I'm sorry. *sniff* But, I swear to you on my momma's grave, I was sleeping. Maybe the security lady only thought she saw me?
Phoenix:
(What did she see...? He doesn't seem to be lying.)




The security lady







Phoenix:
Umm... about the security guard at the main gate to the studio...
Will:
Oh, the security lady?
Maya:
She's terrible! She called me "suspicious lookin'"!
Will:
Y-yes... actually, she's said the same thing to me before. "Take off that mask!" were her words, I believe. She sucks up to all the bigwigs at the studio... But let her see you stumble once and she'll never let up on you.

Detective Gumshoe, what's down the path to the left? It looks like a tree fell down over the path...?
Gumshoe:
Oh, yeah. That way's kind of dangerous. You should stay out, pal. There's nothing down there, anyway. That's where Studio Two used to be, they tell me. They don't use it now, though.

Oh, the wind was pretty strong yesterday, and the head broke off. It took that tree down with it, too.




Security camera







Phoenix:
Hey, there's a camera here.
Gumshoe:
That's the security camera. It takes photos of people going to the studio. All you have to do is look at the data and you can see who went where!
Phoenix:
There's a number plate on the camera... [ST1-307]. That must be the camera ID number.




Studio One entrance

The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.
Maya:
Let's go in and check it out, Nick! ... Hey! It's locked!
Phoenix:
Looks like you need a cardkey to get in. It makes sense that they would want to keep the non-employees out.




Welcome sign







Maya:
There's a big welcome sign above the path.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, apparently the studio's fallen on tough times. They've started letting people in on days they aren't filming. They make a bit of extra money by charging for admission.
Maya:
Huh. You sure know a lot about this place, Detective. You know, you could always quit being a detective and work here?

Yeah! And what perfect timing, with the monkey's neck broken and all.

Gumshoe:
I'm not at liberty to give you any more information, pal. You'll hear all you need to know in court!
Phoenix:
(Oh well, it was worth a try.)




Reason for arrest







Phoenix:
Why was Mr. Powers arrested?
Gumshoe:
Simple, pal! The murder took place right over there in Studio One. Now, the victim entered Studio One at approximately 1:00 PM. At that time, there was no one other than the victim in the studio. According to the autopsy report, the time of death was 2:30 PM. Only one person went to the studio between 1:00 and 2:30! And that person was none other than Will Powers! No one else, pal! If you think I'm lying, ask the security lady at the main gate.
Maya:
Nick! If that's true...! Anyone would think that Powers did it with that kind of evidence!
Phoenix:
Thanks for cheering me up...




The security lady







Phoenix:
About the security lady...
Gumshoe:
Oh, that sweet old lady. What a charmer!
Phoenix:
Huh? A-are we talking about the same person?
Gumshoe:
When I showed her my badge she gave me a donut and some coffee!
Maya:
Remember what Powers said. She's a sucker for authority.
Gumshoe:
She even gave me a piece of valuable evidence!

Decisive evidence (appears after "The security lady")







Phoenix:
What kind of evidence!?
Gumshoe:
Well, that, er, photo. The photo of the Steel Samurai heading toward the scene of the crime!
Maya:
What! Who took that!?
Gumshoe:

Maybe it should just be a big "L" for "Lawyer"?

Photographic proof







Phoenix:
Why didn't you tell us about the security photo, ma'am?
Oldbag:
Hmm? Oh, that? I just thought it would be more thrilling to talk with the detective himself! These things are important, you know. Oh, just to the left from here is the gate with the camera that took that photo. It's my job to check the photos every day, you see.




Reason for suspicion







Oldbag:
This guard station is in a central position. No matter where you go here, you pass by my station first! Now poor Hammer, he went to the studio just before 1:00. The murder happened right around 2:30, see? The only one I seen go through here between 1:00 and 2:30 was Powers himself! The security camera got a good look at him too. If he's not the one what did it, I don't know who is!
Phoenix:
Maybe... it was you?
Oldbag:
Gyah hah ha hah! Good one, sonny.
Phoenix:
(She thinks I was joking.)




Mr. Hammer







Phoenix:
Was the victim, Mr. Hammer, a popular actor?
Oldbag:
Oh, he was the biggest star in the studio!
Phoenix:
("Was"? Past tense?)
Maya:
Oh yes! He was great as the "Bearded Samurai"!
Oldbag:
That too, yes. He shone the brightest! Back in the day. Making a star like him play the "Evil Magistrate"... It's a disgrace, I tell you! Hammer took it pretty hard, and who can blame him?




Automatic camera (appears after "Photographic proof")







Phoenix:
About the security camera...
Oldbag:
Oh yes, the camera. It's automatic. It can tell when someone walks through that gate, see? Then it snaps a photo! Apparently, it records the time when it takes a picture too. But I don't bother myself with those details. I just view all the photos on the computer over in the security guard station. I check 'em every day before going home, I do.October 16Wright & Co.

What to do







Phoenix:
What do you think?
Maya:
That photo the detective was talking about is the problem here.
Phoenix:
Well, that's hard to say, without seeing the actual photo ourselves. But if it is Powers in that photo, his alibi is shot.




Photographic proof







Phoenix:
Only one person went to the scene of the crime before the murder took place. And there's a photograph to prove it.
Maya:
I guess it makes sense that that person is the killer then. What do we do, Nick?
Phoenix:
Maybe there was someone else who could have gone to the scene other than Powers? Let's take a look. Maybe that security lady missed someone?

Drain grate







Phoenix:
The metal grate on the drain here has been taken off. That's a pretty big drain. A kid could fit through there, I bet.
Maya:
Yeah, if you snuck in that way you wouldn't have to pay at the gate!
Phoenix:
Well, if you want to leave that way, be my guest.

Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks or something. Popcorn, at least!

No one actually saw him taking a nap here, did they?Phoenix:
Right, and there's a picture of him near the crime scene. (I hope he's telling the truth... for his sake!)Examine









Cosmetics







Phoenix:
There's a vast array of cosmetics here.
Maya:
Ooh! This is the wig he used in "Samurai Boogey-Woogey"! Nick! Try this on!
Phoenix:
No. And how can you tell the name of a show just by looking at a wig!?
Maya:
I, um, kinda like samurai movies.
Phoenix:
("Kinda"...?)




Costume rack







Phoenix:
There's some regular suits in among the costumes here. Those must be his own clothes.
Maya:
It'd be fun to wear one of the costumes...
Phoenix:
(I'd say you were already wearing one, myself.)




Couch







Phoenix:
Looks like someone was sleeping here. Maybe Powers did take a nap here yesterday...




Mirror







Phoenix:
They always have mirrors like this in dressing rooms. I see my hair is still nice and spiky, just how I like it.




Bag







Maya:
Hmm? This must be Powers's bag.
Phoenix:
Hey, don't open that.
Maya:
Look!
Phoenix:
An employee cardkey. That must be Powers's. It says "Studio One."
Maya:
Let's take it, Nick!
Phoenix:
Borrow it. You mean borrow.
Cardkey added to the Court Record.




Bag (subsequent times)







Maya:
I wonder what else is inside Powers's bag...?
Phoenix:
Stop that! (My partner, the thief in training.)




Table







Phoenix:
There's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Some tea and cookies...
Maya:
Nick... I'm hungry!
Phoenix:
You just had a burger!
Maya:
Yeah, but I have a separate stomach for sweets!
Phoenix:
(How many stomachs does this girl have!?)




Window







Phoenix:
It's locked. Looks like he doesn't open his window much. I guess it is kind of dusty outside.Wright & Co. Law OfficesPresent









Cardkey







Maya:
Oh, hey! That's the cardkey to get into Studio One where the murder took place! Let's go check it out!Studio - Main GatePresent









Cardkey







Phoenix:
Could you tell me about this, ma'am?
Oldbag:
Oh that! Isn't that a studio cardkey? You better watch it! The scene of a murder is no place for sightseeing! I'll be taking that! Hand it over!
Phoenix:
W-wait! No, that's mine!
Oldbag:
Look, I don't have a cardkey to the studio, see? I want to go pay my respects to Jack Hammer where he died.
Phoenix:
W... well you'll just have to wait!Outside Studio OneExamine









Studio One entrance







Phoenix:
The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.
Maya:
Let's go in and check it out, Nick!
Phoenix:
I wonder if this cardkey we borrowed from the dressing room will work...

*beep*

Phoenix:
It opened!
Maya:
Alright! We're in!
Phoenix:
(She's way too happy for someone visiting a crime scene.)Present









Cardkey







Maya:
Hey, Detective! Take a look at this!
Gumshoe:
Whazzat?
Phoenix:
Whoa whoa whoa! Don't show him that! He'll confiscate it!
Maya:
Aww... I just wanted to show it off.After examining Studio One entrance in Studio One Entrance:October 16Studio OneMaya:

What is it?Maya:
...Phoenix:
You're real quiet all of a sudden.Maya:
Doesn't it give you the shivers, Nick? That white tape! It's so... so real!Phoenix:
Well, the Evil Magistrate did die here. And the Steel Samurai killed him. The murder weapon was the Samurai Spear. Sounds pretty real to me...Examine









Director's chair







Maya:
Hey! Look! That's the chair the director sits in! I've always wanted to sit in one of these. Hey Nick, take a look at that. One of those black-and-white boards they clap at the start of filming! And look! A megaphone! A real live megaphone!
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
Ready, Nick? Action!
Phoenix:
(This girl is more troubled than I thought...)




Film camera







Leads to:
"Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!"




Reflecting screen







Maya:
What's this?
Phoenix:
That's for reflecting light. They call it a reflecting screen or something like that. The assistant holds it during filming.
Maya:
Huh.
Phoenix:
What? Where's your enthusiasm for all things entertainment?
Maya:
Well, lighting is fine, but I'd want to be the director. Or maybe the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
(I think she's being serious...!)




Stage backdrop







Phoenix:
Looks like a backdrop for a stage. This must be used in the Steel Samurai show.
Maya:
Of course! That's the mountain, Neo Fujiyama!
Phoenix:
Doesn't the Steel Samurai take place in Olde Tokyo? Can you even see Mt. Fuji from there?
Maya:
Not Olde Tokyo, Nick! "Neo" Olde Tokyo!
Phoenix:
Oh. Right.




(Step)ladder







Maya:
Look, a ladder!
Phoenix:
That's a "step"-ladder.
Maya:
So? What's the difference? You need to stop judging things based on narrow-minded cultural assumptions, Nick!
Phoenix:
R-right... sorry. (This girl is OUT there!)




Tape outline







Phoenix:
They outlined where Jack Hammer's body lay with tape. His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. I guess that's why the head part looks like a helmet. Funny, I expected a spear stabbing would leave at least a few bloodstains. I guess the costume must have absorbed most of it...Maya:
Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!Phoenix:
Yeah! So don't touch it!Maya:
Whoa! It's heavier than I thought...???:
Hey! You! No touching that!Phoenix:
Ah, um, sorry, my partner is kind of, y'know...Maya:
"Y'know"!? No I don't know!Phoenix:
Umm... who are you?Penny:
Who me? I'm an assistant here. I help with props and stuff. Moving them around, ordering new ones, et cetera.Maya:
We're lawyers representing Mr. Will Powers.Penny:
Oh, you're WP's people.Maya:
"WP"...? Oh, Will Powers. W.P., I get it.Penny:
I don't envy you guys one bit! But... do what you can for WP, okay? He'd never hurt a fly! He has to be innocent.Maya:
Don't worry, leave it to us!Talk









The day of the crime







Phoenix:
Could you tell me anything about the day of the murder?
Penny:
Yes. I was in the studio the whole day. I was the only assistant on staff that day, you see.
Maya:
Only one assistant!?
Penny:
Yes, well, the studios isn't doing so well right now. (Changed from [Yes, well, the studios aren't doing so well right now.] in the original release) And yesterday was only rehearsal for our action sequences.
Maya:
Oh, I see. (Changed from [I see. Neat!] in the original release)
Penny:
In the morning we went through the action sequences in the employee area. WP and Hammer were there, along with everyone else.
Phoenix:
The employee area--that's where Powers's dressing room is, right?
Penny:
Yes, that's the place. After eating lunch there, Mr. Hammer went to Studio One. Then I saw WP go into his dressing room. But I didn't see either of them after that.




Will Powers







Phoenix:
Did you know that Mr. Powers was sleeping in his room?
Penny:
No! I wouldn't go in there unless I had some urgent message for him... I mean, it's his private... What kind of a girl do you think I am!?
Phoenix:
W-what kind...? No, no, I'm sure you're a fine girl. Um, sorry. (So much for getting a confirmation of Powers's alibi.)Present









Anything







Phoenix:
Um, any thoughts about this?
Penny:
Sorry... I... don't really want to think too much about what happened just yet.After clearing all Talk options:Maya:
What do we do, Nick? We haven't found anything. If WP was the only one who came to the studio... Then he has to be the killer! They even have a photograph...Phoenix:
Hmm...Penny:
Umm... Sorry... I know you're busy.Phoenix:
Not really.Penny:
Actually, there's been something bothering me.Maya:
Ah hah! That's what I'm talking about! A clue! A lead!Penny:
Well, I don't know about that, but that day, just after noon, I sensed someone was here...Phoenix:
You "sensed"?Penny:
Yes, several times.Phoenix:
Some other studio employees, maybe?Penny:
No, I don't think so. The only thing we had scheduled was an action scene run-through. I was the only assistant here that day. I have a feeling it was someone from... outside.Phoenix:
R-really!?Maya:
But wait, if someone had come in here... Wouldn't that security lady have noticed them?Phoenix:
Yeah, you're right.Penny:
I'm sorry I don't have any better information than that.Maya:
No, thanks! That helps us a lot. Anything helps. Let's go put that security lady on the spot!Talk









Sensing someone







Phoenix:
So you sensed that someone other than the regular film crew was in the studio?
Penny:
Yes... I think.
Phoenix:
("I think" doesn't cut it in a witness testimony.)
Maya:
Nick! What about that security lady! If someone else came into the studio, she must have seen them!October 16Global StudiosMain GateOldbag:
What? You're still here? Really! You look as though you've seen a ghost!Talk









Assistant's claim







Leads to:
"What? I saw that suspicious look on your face!"Oldbag:
What? I saw that suspicious look on your face!Phoenix:
I wanted to ask you again about yesterday... You came here at 1:00 PM, correct? And the estimated time of Hammer's death was 2:30. Are you sure that Powers was the only one to go through here between those times?Oldbag:
Sure as can be!Maya:
But we have a witness who thinks there was "someone from outside" here that day.Oldbag:
What!?Maya:
Are you absolutely sure you were here watching the whole time?Oldbag:
...Maya:
Ma'am?Oldbag:
Who was it? Who told you that? Who dares question ME!?Maya:
Eek!Oldbag:
Alright you better tell me and tell me quick, you spiky-haired cretin! Someone's been complaining about the work I do, eh!?Maya:
Uh... um, we were just talking to the assistant in Studio One.Oldbag:
Her! She's not even a full-time employee! All you young'uns are like that nowadays, running your mouths like there was no tomorrow saying this that and the other thing. Well when I was young let me tell you we knew a thing or two about respecting our elders. Back then we did and it's a crying shame that you youths today just say what you please about poor old ladies Graaaaaaaaaaaawr!Phoenix:
She left...Maya:
Well, Nick? This is our chance to do what we can without her looking over our shoulders!Examine









Computer







Phoenix:
The computer that runs the studio security cameras.
Maya:
Nick! Maybe we can see that photo of Powers with this computer!
Phoenix:
Yeah, maybe. (Should I try the computer?)



Try it







Phoenix:
Okay. Let's give it a try.
Maya:
You know how to work these things, Nick?
Phoenix:
Looks like I just have to enter in a few numbers. Let's see... first, I need the date of the murder. (It looks like the camera turned on at 1:00 PM that day... 1:00... That was when the security lady arrived at the guard station.)
[Please enter the number of the security camera.]



ST1-703







Phoenix:
There! Entered!
Maya:
... ... Nothing happened.
Phoenix:
Huh? Maybe I got the number wrong.
Maya:
*sigh* Maybe we should go look at that camera again?

Maya:
What? You're not going to look at it? Bo-ring!

There! Entered! ...Maya:
Hey! It printed out the data for that day!Phoenix:
Let's see what we got... ... Huh?Maya:
How is this a picture of Will Powers?Phoenix:
Well, he is the one who always wears that suit... I guess that's why the security lady thought it was him.Maya:
I don't imagine the detective was very happy with this photo as evidence. Hmm? Something's printed on the back.Phoenix:
Huh? [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2]Maya:
What does that mean?Phoenix:
Maybe there's more photo data from that day?Maya:
Nope--that's the only one in the computer.Powers's{?} Photo added to the Court Record.Maya:
Hey, hey, Nick! Can't we use this photo as evidence for the trial?Phoenix:
Yeah.Maya:
We'll put that security lady in her place with this!Phoenix:
Right, we'll put her in her place...Maya:
Hey, that's what I said! Anyway... Let's show her this photo and see what she says!Phoenix:
Wait. Let's not.Maya:
Why not?Phoenix:
It's never a good idea to reveal your hand to the enemy too soon.Maya:
Nick! You're craftier than I gave you credit for. Why, you could be the next... Evil Magistrate!Phoenix:
Hey! Why do I have to be the villain.Maya:
Relax, it was just a joke! So, are we done for today?Phoenix:
I think this photo is what we needed for the trial. Still, it'd be better if we had some idea who the real killer was! Maybe it really is that security lady...?To be continued.Before selecting "ST1-307" upon examining computer in Global Studios - Main Gate:October 16Studio OneMaya:

Part 6October 18, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:
Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth:
The prosecution will show the court that at 2:30 PM on October 15, the defendant, Mr. Will Powers, killed fellow actor Jack Hammer at Studio One of Global Studios. It is impossible for anyone else to have committed this heinous crime. The evidence presented during the trial will all point to this fact.Judge:
Hmm. I see. Very well, I would like to move on to your testimony. Mr. Edgeworth, the prosecution may call its first witness.Edgeworth:
Very well, I call a most familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand. (Changed from [First, I would like to call a familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand.] in the original release)Edgeworth:
Detective, if you would briefly describe this case to the court?Gumshoe:
Yes sir! I'll explain with the guidemap here. To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see? This here is the Employee Area. The actors did a run-through of their action scenes during the morning here. This is the main gate to the studios. The security lady that works at the studios was here at 1:00 PM on that day. Past the security station there is a gate, see? Past that are the studios. And here it is... Studio One. This is the scene of the murder, where the body was found! Now, on the day of the murder, October 15, there were only three people here. The victim, Jack Hammer, the defendant, Will Powers, and a young woman, the production assistant. All the production staff were in the Employee Area until noon. Then after lunch, the victim, Jack Hammer, went to Studio One. Right after that, at 1:00 PM, the security lady got to the guard station. Now, jump ahead to later that day... 5:00 PM. The production staff came to Studio One to perform a rehearsal. Needless to say, the rehearsal was cancelled... The time of death was 2:30 PM. The "Samurai Spear" found lodged in the victim's chest was the murder weapon. That's the case, in brief. Anyone like to hear that again?Phoenix:
(Hmm... should I listen to that whole thing again...?)Skip it







Leads to:
"I think I can probably remember that..."Listen again







Phoenix:
I'm sorry, could you describe that one more time?
Gumshoe:
I shoulda known it would be you, pal! Fine. Once more for the mentally-challenged lawyer.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, yeah. Live it up while you can, Gumshoe.)
Leads back to:
"To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see?"Phoenix:
(I think I can probably remember that...)Judge:
So the murder weapon was a "spear"? How... medieval!Samurai Spear added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:
Your Honor. This case is quite simple if you ask one question: And that question is: "What did the security lady at the guard station see?"Judge:
Understood.Edgeworth:
Let's call this security officer to the stand!Edgeworth:
Will the witness declare her name?Oldbag:
... Hmm? My, aren't you a handsome fellow! I'm afraid I'm a bit flustered!Edgeworth:
Y-your name, please!Oldbag:
Oh, dearie! No need for you to be embarrassed! Just call me "grandma."Edgeworth:
YOUR NAME, PLEASE!Phoenix:
(Seems Edgeworth has a bit of trouble getting his witnesses to say their names...)Oldbag:
Wendy Oldbag, dearie. So just call me "grandma." It's practically my name! So even when I was young I was an Oldbag, but not really that was just my name dearie. Still how the other children would make fun of me and just because of my name can you believe it? But there was this boy, the captain of the chess club in junior high, and when he called me an old bag well I just cried and cried because I had a crush on him you see--Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
O-objection! I... object to the witness's talkativeness.Judge:
Objection sustained! The witness will refrain from rambling on the stand.Oldbag:
I was just getting to the good part, dearie!Edgeworth:
Perhaps we can get to the testimony?Judge:
Now, the witness was stationed at the main gate on the day of the murder, correct?Oldbag:
Yessey I was.Judge:
And to get to the scene of the murder, someone would have to pass by you?Oldbag:
You know your stuff, dearie!Judge:
... You may begin your testimony.Phoenix:
(She sure is one hell of an Oldbag...)Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Oldbag:
On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.
Poor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.
I, well, I had some errands to run that morning.
Anyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.
I was at the main gate from then until 5:00!
Now, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?
Interesting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.
It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!Judge:
You saw the defendant, then? Hmm... Very well. Let's begin the cross-examination. Mr. Wright?Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.Cross Examination-- Witness's Account --Oldbag:
On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So up until that time, anyone who wanted to could go into the studio?
Oldbag:
Well, there wasn't a security guard at the gate, no. But the main gate was locked, dearie. You'd need an employee cardkey to get in.
Phoenix:
(Right... the cardkey that I have. So, what she's saying is no one who wasn't supposed to be there could get in.)
Edgeworth:
Was there anyone at the studios when you arrived at the guard station?Oldbag:
Poor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
A "run-through"...?
Oldbag:
They were working out a scene between the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate. They got the basics figured out by noon, and were to use the afternoon for practice. Rehearsal was supposed to start at 5:00. That's why poor old Hammer went to Studio One in the afternoon.
Phoenix:
(So Powers was in his dressing room sleeping... when he was supposed to be practicing! Talk about a laid-back hero...)
Edgeworth:
If there was a run-through in the morning, why did you only get there after noon?Oldbag:
I, well, I had some errands to run that morning.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What kind of "errands"?
Oldbag:
Oh, well, you know.
Phoenix:
Answer the question!
Oldbag:
Actually... I was watching poor Hammer and Powers. Observing, you know?
Phoenix:
O-observing? Weren't you supposed to be at the guard station?
Oldbag:
Whippersnapper! I told you I locked the gate, didn't I? I did my job!
Phoenix:
(I'm not sure your boss would see it that way...)
Oldbag:
Anyway! I always watch Hammer's run-throughts. Always! Never missed one in all my years.
Maya:
Wow! I want to see a Steel Samurai run-through too!
Phoenix:
You could quit being a spirit medium and take up guard duty.
Maya:
Not a bad idea...Oldbag:
Anyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Did you see the victim then?
Oldbag:
Did I see poor old Hammer? Nope. He'd already gone to the studio before I got back to the guard station.
Edgeworth:
Tell us what happened next.Oldbag:
I was at the main gate from then until 5:00!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So you were watching there the WHOLE time? No breaks? Not even a second?
Oldbag:
O-of course! I am a professional, you know! Our are you criticizing how I do my job!? Whippersnapper!
Phoenix:
No, it's just, after seeing you eating those donuts in the guard station yesterday...
Oldbag:
I can watch the gate and eat donuts at the same time! Snipperwhapper!
Maya:
"Snipperwhapper"...? Old windbag is losing it, Nick.
Phoenix:
Why don't you raise an objection?
Judge:
So, the witness was on duty through the afternoon, the whole time. Very well. What did you see?Oldbag:
Now, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
How did you know that?
Oldbag:
Oh hoh hoh. I have my ways! That over-dressed young detective told me. I fed him some donuts and he talked and talked... If you ask me, that detective isn't cut out for his job.
Edgeworth:

Phoenix:

Interesting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
2:00? You're sure?
Oldbag:
Sure as spit!
Judge:
Well, who was the man!?

Ugh. Can't she get her kicks somewhere else?Phoenix:
Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag! You've been saying since yesterday that you "saw Mr. Powers," correct? But you're talking about the man in this photo, aren't you!Judge:
J-just a moment, Mr. Wright. Let me see that photo! ... What is this, exactly?Phoenix:
None other than the Steel Samurai, defender of Neo Olde Tokyo. Ms. Oldbag! Is this the "Mr. Powers" that you saw!?Oldbag:
Of course! Didn't your momma teach you any sense, sonny? Anyone can plainly see that's Powers! Right?Edgeworth:
No, they can't! (Changed from [Um, yeah.] in the original release) ... Umm... well. I mean, I wonder? (Changed from [Umm... well. I wonder?] in the original release)Phoenix:
True, Mr. Powers does play the role of the Steel Samurai! But that doesn't mean Mr. Powers IS the Steel Samurai!Oldbag:
...! I... I know that! I wasn't born yesterday!Judge:
No one in this court is accusing you of that, Ms... er, witness.Phoenix:
(He's having trouble calling her "Oldbag" apparently...)Judge:
However, you do not have proof that the person in this photo is Mr. Will Powers, do you?Oldbag:
Humph! Nosy old man! Of course I have proof!Phoenix:
What!?Edgeworth:
Huh!?Phoenix:
(Even Edgeworth is surprised!?)Edgeworth:
The prosecution would like to ask the old... the witness. Please make known all the information in your possession ahead of time!Oldbag:
How was I to know everyone would be so nosy! You should be ashamed, all of you! Anyway, I showed that photo to the young detective. He told me "this isn't any good as evidence, pal." He didn't even give it a second look!Edgeworth:
...Phoenix:
(Wow, old windbag has left even Edgeworth speechless. She's good!)Judge:
Let's hear about your proof, then.Witness Testimony-- The Man in the Photo --Oldbag:
I never say anything I don't mean, mind you!
That morning, during the run-through of the action scene...
I saw Powers trip and fall!
He broke one of the props, it was a big mess.
Apparently, he sprained his ankle pretty bad.
Now, look at that picture!
You can see he's dragging his leg! See? Clear as day!
That's how I knew it was Powers. Happy?Judge:
Hmm. So he had sprained his ankle...? Very well. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Phoenix:

Well, let's see... There was Powers, he's the Steel Samurai... Then poor old Hammer, the Evil Magistrate. And... me.
Judge:
And what exactly were you doing?
Oldbag:
Observing! Just... observing.
Phoenix:
What about the assistant?
Oldbag:
Oh, she was off moving backdrops around and such.

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
"Trip and fall"...?
Oldbag:
Yes! And to think, he's supposed to be the Steel Samurai! What a laugh! So Powers sprained his ankle. I helped make it better for him, of course.
Judge:
You... helped make it better?
Oldbag:
I kissed it where it hurt.
Judge:
L-let's just skip over that part, shall we?
Phoenix:
Where was the assistant then?
Oldbag:
Oh, her? She was cleaning up backdrops, I think. She didn't know about Powers's ankle.

(This strikes me as a significant detail...)Oldbag:
Apparently, he sprained his ankle pretty bad.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Was Mr. Power's [sic] ankle badly sprained?
Oldbag:
Not so bad that he couldn't walk around. He went to his dressing room to rest up after lunch.
Phoenix:
(Thus the nap...)
Oldbag:
Anyway, I saw him dragging his foot when he walked.
Phoenix:
(Dragging his foot... okay.)Oldbag:
You can see he's dragging his leg! See? Clear as day!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Are you absolutely sure? (Let's take a look at that picture again... Hmm... so he was walking strangely because he was injured...)
Judge:
Hmm. It does look like he was dragging his foot.
Oldbag:
See! And you didn't trust me! Whippersnapper!Oldbag:
That's how I knew it was Powers. Happy?Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Still, you can't look at this and say it's Mr. Powers!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Yes, but only Mr. Powers would have been dragging his leg!
Judge:
He has a point. It does seem quite likely that it was Powers.
Phoenix:
(There's got to be more to this. I'd better keep pressing her.)Maya:
Well, Nick? Find any glaring contradictions?Phoenix:
Well, she seems pretty sure that was Powers in that photo... I guess I'll just press her and see if I can shake her conviction...After pressing second or third statement, then pressing fourth statement:Edgeworth:
I think we've heard enough! Haven't we, Your Honor?Judge:
Well, there is one thing that bothers me.Edgeworth:
Which is?Judge:
Where is this "Steel Samurai" costume now?Edgeworth:
Umm... hmm. Actually, well... We couldn't find it. We're looking, though.Judge:
Hmm...Edgeworth:
Anyway, that's not important! The witness did see the Steel Samurai, yes. And it is clear that the person in the Steel Samurai suit was Mr. Will Powers!Judge:
Hmm... I suppose that's right.Phoenix:
(Are you sure you're sure, Your Honor?)Object







Phoenix:
Hold it right there! We keep talking possibilities, but we have to agree that this photo shows the Steel Samurai! Nowhere in this photo can we see Mr. Will Powers!
Judge:
Hmm... The defense has a point. I also wonder if someone else not caught on camera could have killed Mr. Hammer. We have to consider that possibility, also.
Edgeworth:
Then allow me to remove that doubt from your mind, Your Honor...
Leads to:
"Will the witness continue her testimony, please?"Wait and see what happens







Phoenix:
(I think I'll wait and see where this goes.)
Judge:
I suppose, since there weren't any additional crew members at the studios that day... It's quite likely that it was the defendant inside that costume. I see no problem with this evidence.
Edgeworth:
Most perceptive, Your Honor!
Phoenix:
(He still doesn't seem that convinced to me... I hope.)
Leads to:
"Will the witness continue her testimony, please?"Edgeworth:
Will the witness continue her testimony, please?Oldbag:
No need to ask twice!Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account, cont. --Oldbag:
The time of poor Hammer's death was 2:30 PM, true?
The only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers!
No one else went there!
If they had, I would have seen them!Judge:
Hmm... So, if no one else went to the studio... Then it would have to be this "Steel Samurai" who did it. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Cross Examination

2025-01-22 14:44:11,562 - INFO - Assistant reply: To find the contradiction in the witness's testimony, let's analyze the statements and the evidence:

1. **Testimony**: The witness claims the time of death was 2:30 PM.
2. **Testimony**: The only person they saw before then was Will Powers.
3. **Testimony**: No one else went to the studio.
4. **Testimony**: If someone else had gone there, they would have seen them.

Let's compare this with the evidence that we have:

- **Jack's Autopsy Report**: Confirms the time of death as 2:30 PM.
- **Powers's(?) Photo**: The photo shows the Steel Samurai walking, dragging one leg. The timestamp is 2:00 PM, Photo #2.
- **Mr. Monkey's Head**: Indicates that the path to the crime scene was blocked from 2:15 PM to 4:00 PM.

From this, we see a potential contradiction with statement 3 ("No one else went there!") and the evidence regarding **Mr. Monkey's Head**. If the path was blocked from 2:15 PM to 4:00 PM, it would have been difficult for anyone to access the studio during that timeframe, suggesting that the witness's statement that no one else went there doesn't account for this blockage. 

Thus, evidence #11, Mr. Monkey's Head, could be leveraging this contradiction for the statement that nobody else could have gone to the studio because the path was obstructed during a crucial time period following their stated time of becoming aware of Powers entering at 2:00 PM.

Well, I have to say Phoenix, I'm impressed! Not everyone takes on a murder trial right off the bat like this. It says a lot about you... and your client as well.Phoenix:\nUm... thanks. Actually, it's because I owe him a favor.Mia:\nA favor? You mean, you knew the defendant before this case?Phoenix:\nYes. Actually, I kind of owe my current job to him. He's one of the reasons I became an attorney.Mia:\nWell, that's news to me!Phoenix:\nI want to help him out any way I can! I just... really want to help him. I owe him that much.???:\n(It's over!

The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say it was you...)Phoenix:\nMy name is Phoenix Wright. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\" In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!August 3, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.

I'm drawing a total blank here!)Mia:\nPhoenix! Are you absolutely SURE you're up to this? You don't even know the victim's name!?Phoenix:\nOh, the victim! O-Of course I know the victim's name!

(Because I don't FEEL relaxed, that's for sure.)Judge:\nWell, then... First, a question for the prosecution. Mr. Payne?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nAs Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to the court just what that \"object\" was?Payne:\nThe murder weapon was this statue of \"The Thinker.\" It was found lying on the floor, next to the victim.Judge:\nI see... The court accepts it into evidence. (Changed from [I see... the court accepts it into evidence.] in the original release)Statue added to the Court Record.Mia:\nWright...

You don't want to miss any information that might help your client's case. You'll get your chance to respond to the prosecution later, so be ready!

Is it not true that the victim had recently dumped you?Butz:\nHey, watch it buddy! We were great together! We were Romeo and Juliet, Cleopatra and Mark Anthony!Phoenix:\n(Um... didn't they all die?)Butz:\nI wasn't dumped! She just wasn't taking my phone calls. Or seeing me... Ever. WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?Payne:\nMr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by \"dumped.\" In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!Butz:\nWhaddya mean, \"one of them\"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!Payne:\nYour Honor, the victim's passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.Passport added to the Court Record.Judge:\nHmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.Butz:\nDude... no way...Payne:\nThe victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several \"Sugar Daddies.\"Butz:\nDaddies? Sugar?Payne:\nYes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.Butz:\nDuuude!Payne:\nWe can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?Mia:\nWright... I don't think you want him to answer that question.Phoenix:\n(Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)Wait and see what happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Might be better not to get involved in this one...)\nPayne:\nWell, Mr. Butz?\nButz:\nDude, no way!

That question is irrelevant to this case!\nPayne:\nOof! *wince*\nButz:\nDude! Nick! Whaddya mean, \"irrelevant\"!? That cheatin' she-dog!\nLeads to:\n\"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!\"Butz:\nI'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I'm going to get to the bottom of this!Judge:\nLet's continue with the trial, shall we?Payne:\nI believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.Judge:\nYes, quite.Phoenix:\n(Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)Payne:\nNext question! You went to the victim's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?Butz:\nGulp!Payne:\nWell, did you, or did you not?Butz:\nHeh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn't!Phoenix:\n(Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)Have him answer honestly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I know! I'll send him a signal...)\n\n(TELL THE TRUTH)\n\nButz:\nEr... Yeah! Yeah! I was there! I went!\nJudge:\nOrder! Well, Mr. Butz?\nButz:\nDude, chill! She wasn't home, man... So, like, I didn't see her.\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nYour Honor, the defendant is lying.\nJudge:\nLying?\nPayne:\nThe prosecution would like to call a witness who can prove Mr. Butz is lying.\nLeads to:\n\"Well, that simplifies matters.

Question:

During the cross-examination, identify the contradiction in the witness's testimony by presenting the appropriate evidence at the correct statement.
In this example, the witness claims to remember the time exactly as 1:00 PM, but the Cindy's Autopsy Report records the time of death between 4 PM-5 PM. This discrepancy can be presented as evidence to contradict the witness's statement.

Answer:
{
  "action": "present",
  "testimony": 9,
  "evidence": 2
}You may now present evidence that is helpful in finding a contradiction in the testimony. To present evidence, answer the question with a JSON object in the format of {"action": "present", "testimony": <number of the testimony>, "evidence": <number of the evidence>}, for example {"action": "present", "testimony": 5, "evidence": 2}.

Now for the morning news. The actor Will Powers was arrested yesterday. Powers plays the lead role in the popular kid's show "The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo." He was arrested on suspicion of murder. The victim was Jack Hammer, who plays the villain known as the "Evil Magistrate." His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. The "Samurai Spear" was also found stuck through the body. Police believe this was the murder weapon, and are investigating further.Phoenix:

Bookshelf







Phoenix:
There's a horrendous amount of legal books here. Scarier still is the thought that I have to read all of these now.




Houseplant







Phoenix:
Mia's favorite potted plant. Maya has been watering it so much lately it looks a little... swollen. She's either trying to make it grow... or she's perfecting her water torture technique.




Movie poster







Phoenix:
A poster of an old movie that Mia liked. I was thinking I should go see it myself. Then I realized that the poster doesn't actually say the title of the movie.




Desk







Phoenix:
Mia's desk. Actually... it's my desk now. Sitting here always makes me feel like a professional.




Window







Phoenix:
It's a nice day outside. The hotel across the way is always full these days. There's the bellboy, happily cleaning the room.Talk









What to do







Phoenix:
Well, what should we do?
Maya:
What should we do!? How can you just sit there like that!? We have to get down to the detention center and meet the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
(Does she want to investigate this case or just do some sightseeing, I wonder? My money's on sightseeing.)




Any ideas

Security guard







Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He seems frozen in awe of Will Powers.Talk









What happened







Phoenix:
Maybe you could start by telling us what happened.
Will:
Y-yes. Of course. It seems like it was only yesterday. Actually, it was only yesterday. The cast had come down to Global Studios for a run-through. We went through a few action sequences at 10:00 that morning. There was a rehearsal scheduled for 5:00 in the afternoon. But when 5:00 came around, and the staff gathered at the studio... The Evil Magistrate was found lying in a crumpled heap near the set. They took off his mask... And discovered that it was Jack Hammer... dead! He had been expertly skewered with the Samurai Spear.
Phoenix:
The "Samurai Spear"...?
Will:
Yes, it's a long spear that I... that the Steel Samurai uses as a weapon.




The Steel Samurai







Phoenix:
Maybe you could explain to me just what "the Steel Samurai" is.
Maya:
Nick! How could you say such a thing? I-I'm sorry, sir, I apologize for my partner! He's new to this, and a bit OUT OF TOUCH with the world.
Phoenix:
Hey! Who's "new to this"!?
Will:
No, it's alright, really. The Steel Samurai is the lead character in a popular kid's show. He walks the streets of Neo Olde Tokyo... Fighting battle after battle against the Evil Magistrate and his minions. Of course, he never really defeats the Evil Magistrate. Although... I guess he did defeat him this time... *sniff* Uwaaah!
Phoenix:
I-I see. (Neo Olde Tokyo...? Who comes up with these names!?)




Powers's alibi (appears after "What happened")







Phoenix:
Now, where were you on the day of the murder?
Will:
Well, that morning I came to studios at 9:00. We worked through some action scenes until noon. Rehearsal was to begin at 5:00, but I was a little tired. So after lunch, I took a nap in my dressing room. When I woke up, it was after 5:00! I was late for the rehearsal! I hurried to the studio... and found everyone looking shocked. They arrested me on the spot, and brought me here.
Phoenix:
(So he was sleeping the entire afternoon of the murder? Some action hero!)
Will:
What will the kids think? *sniff*Present

Gawkers! Sightseers! Tourists!!! I know the type. You heard about the incident and came to snoop around. Youths today! Something horrible happens and all you can think of is sightseeing. Wasting your time at a place like this. Don't you have jobs you should be doing? Or do lawyers not work like the rest of us? Maybe I should become a lawyer too. Sounds like a life of ease to me no work just loafing around all day as you please. Well when I was young things were a mite different, mind you we didn't prance around in strange hippie clothes. What are the youths coming to these days my own son hasn't called in...Maya:

Computer







Phoenix:
The computer that runs the studio security cameras.
Oldbag:
Hey! No touching!




Guard station







Phoenix:
The security guard station. That security lady must like junk food. There's a mountain of it on the desk in there. I can see the computer that runs the security cameras.




Main gate







Phoenix:
The main entrance to the studio. There was a big scene here yesterday with onlookers pressing up against the gate.

Phoenix:
An overhead map of the studios. Right from here is the Employee Area. To the left are the actual film studios.




Studio van







Phoenix:
Looks like a studio van. They probably use it to carry around film equipment.Talk









The studios







Phoenix:
So, what do you do here at the studios?
Oldbag:
At Global Studios, we make children's dreams come true! In fact, in my younger days...
Maya:
No! You were a star!?
Oldbag:
Only a little twinkle between the stars here, I'm afraid, dearie.
Maya:
Wo... wow.
Oldbag:
This place has really gone downhill, you know? But 10 years ago, now that was a studio of dreams! Hammer was a big star back then too, he was...
Phoenix:
Hammer...?
Oldbag:
The victim, dummy! The Evil Magistrate! He's been reduced to playing villains now. Not exactly the best material to work with...




Will Powers







Phoenix:
Can you tell me about Mr. Will Powers?
Oldbag:
He's not a bad kid, but don't be fooled by his mask! You wouldn't want him on the silver screen without it, believe me. Little old ladies watching would lose their lunch! That's probably why he thought that the Steel Samurai was his "big chance." No one thought he was capable of doing what he did to poor Jack Hammer...
Maya:
We don't know for certain that Will Powers is guilty!
Oldbag:
Powers? Of course he's guilty! How do I know? I know everything! That's my job.




Mr. Hammer (appears after "The studios")







Phoenix:
What kind of person was Jack Hammer?
Oldbag:
What "kind of person"? Oh... if you only knew! Jack Hammer will live on in many hearts as the ultimate action hero! He was simply dashing in the Dynamite Samurai series!
Phoenix:
(Should I have heard of that...?)
Oldbag:
But... there was an accident during filming five years ago. He got an unlucky break after that. Reduced to playing the villain on a children's program! What's more, I heard they were paying him peanuts. It's enough to make you cry.




Reason for suspicion (appears after "Will Powers")







Phoenix:
Why are you so certain Mr. Powers is the killer?
Oldbag:
I was standing right here yesterday, I was. I was here from 1:00 in the afternoon, to 5:00, when they found the body! Now the studio where the murder took place is to the left here. So if you want to go to the studio, you have to pass by me! Only one person went by here between 1:00 and 2:30, when the murder took place!
Phoenix:
And... that person was Mr. Powers?
Oldbag:
Yes. I saw him!
Phoenix:
But Mr. Powers says he was sleeping in his dressing room.
Oldbag:
Oh, I'm sure he would say that. He's no fool! But he was the only one that walked by. He's the killer, you can bet your biscuits on it.Present

Your alibi







Phoenix:
Mr. Powers, you aren't hiding anything from me, are you?
Will:
W-what? No! I'd never do that!
Phoenix:
Just now you said that you were sleeping in your dressing room after lunch.
Will:
Yes. Like a baby.
Phoenix:
But the security lady said she saw you that day. She says she saw you heading towards the scene of the crime!
Will:
W-what!? That's not possible! I... I really don't know what to say! I was sleeping, I promise!
Phoenix:
Mr. Powers, if you want me to help you, you have to tell me the truth. I'm new to this lawyer business, and I need every advantage I can get.
Will:
I know... I-I'm sorry. *sniff* But, I swear to you on my momma's grave, I was sleeping. Maybe the security lady only thought she saw me?
Phoenix:
(What did she see...? He doesn't seem to be lying.)




The security lady







Phoenix:
Umm... about the security guard at the main gate to the studio...
Will:
Oh, the security lady?
Maya:
She's terrible! She called me "suspicious lookin'"!
Will:
Y-yes... actually, she's said the same thing to me before. "Take off that mask!" were her words, I believe. She sucks up to all the bigwigs at the studio... But let her see you stumble once and she'll never let up on you.
Maya:
Grr! She's got some nerve!
Phoenix:
Do you think you could write up a letter formally requesting my representation?
Will:
Of c-course.

Gumshoe:
W-well, yeah, but... Hey, us detectives get tired of standing around too, pal!




Left path







Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe, what's down the path to the left? It looks like a tree fell down over the path...?
Gumshoe:
Oh, yeah. That way's kind of dangerous. You should stay out, pal. There's nothing down there, anyway. That's where Studio Two used to be, they tell me. They don't use it now, though.




Statue with broken head







Phoenix:
The studio mascot. I guess it's a monkey of some kind. But what kind of monkey has a nose like that? He's holding a sign in his hand. [Right: To Studio One; Left: To Studio Two]
Maya:
What's up with that thing!? It looks kind of... busted.
Gumshoe:
Oh, the wind was pretty strong yesterday, and the head broke off. It took that tree down with it, too.




Security camera







Phoenix:
Hey, there's a camera here.
Gumshoe:
That's the security camera. It takes photos of people going to the studio. All you have to do is look at the data and you can see who went where!
Phoenix:
There's a number plate on the camera... [ST1-307]. That must be the camera ID number.




Studio One entrance







Phoenix:
The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.
Maya:
Let's go in and check it out, Nick! ... Hey! It's locked!
Phoenix:
Looks like you need a cardkey to get in. It makes sense that they would want to keep the non-employees out.




Welcome sign







Maya:
There's a big welcome sign above the path.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, apparently the studio's fallen on tough times. They've started letting people in on days they aren't filming. They make a bit of extra money by charging for admission.
Maya:
Huh. You sure know a lot about this place, Detective. You know, you could always quit being a detective and work here?
Phoenix:
Yeah! And what perfect timing, with the monkey's neck broken and all.
Gumshoe:
Huh? Just what's that supposed to mean, pal!?Talk









The investigation







Phoenix:
So, how is your investigation going, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Well, it's... Hey! I can't tell you that, pal.

Nick... Maybe you need to be a little more indirect with your questions?
Phoenix:
Right. So, Detective, mind if I take a look at what you got?
Gumshoe:
What I got?
Phoenix:
The autopsy report! The latest version, if you please...
Gumshoe:
Hmm... right, right. Sorry about what happened last time, pal.

Phoenix:
So, how is your investigation going, Detective?
Gumshoe:
I'm not at liberty to give you any more information, pal. You'll hear all you need to know in court!
Phoenix:
(Oh well, it was worth a try.)




Reason for arrest







Phoenix:
Why was Mr. Powers arrested?
Gumshoe:
Simple, pal! The murder took place right over there in Studio One. Now, the victim entered Studio One at approximately 1:00 PM. At that time, there was no one other than the victim in the studio. According to the autopsy report, the time of death was 2:30 PM. Only one person went to the studio between 1:00 and 2:30! And that person was none other than Will Powers! No one else, pal! If you think I'm lying, ask the security lady at the main gate.
Maya:
Nick! If that's true...! Anyone would think that Powers did it with that kind of evidence!
Phoenix:
Thanks for cheering me up...




The security lady







Phoenix:
About the security lady...
Gumshoe:
Oh, that sweet old lady. What a charmer!
Phoenix:
Huh? A-are we talking about the same person?
Gumshoe:
When I showed her my badge she gave me a donut and some coffee!
Maya:
Remember what Powers said. She's a sucker for authority.
Gumshoe:
She even gave me a piece of valuable evidence!
Maya:
Whaat!?




Decisive evidence (appears after "The security lady")







Phoenix:
What kind of evidence!?
Gumshoe:
Well, that, er, photo. The photo of the Steel Samurai heading toward the scene of the crime!
Maya:
What! Who took that!?
Gumshoe:
See the camera up on that gate, pal?
Maya:
The gate? You mean the one with the welcome sign?
Gumshoe:
Yeah. Whenever someone walks by, that camera automatically snaps a photo of them!
Maya:
Oh no! Nick, he has evidence! We're finished!
Phoenix:
(Funny, for someone with hard proof he doesn't look too happy.)
Gumshoe:
...Present









Attorney's Badge







Phoenix:
Detective, see this? This is my attorney's badge.
Gumshoe:
Uh huh? Don'tcha think it's a little sad when you have to explain what your badge means, pal? Real men show their P.D. badge and that's that!
Phoenix:
I'll admit the design of my badge leaves a lot to be desired...
Maya:
Maybe it should just be a big "L" for "Lawyer"?
Phoenix:
Hmm... I'm not so sure about that.




Anything else







Phoenix:
Um, Detective. Any ideas about this?
Gumshoe:
Look, I don't got time to look at every little trinket you got, okay pal?After clearing "The investigation" and "Decisive evidence" Talk options:Gumshoe:
What's wrong, pal? You seem down.Phoenix:
Don't look so happy when you say that.Gumshoe:
Oh hoh hoh hoh hoh!Maya:
Umm... We'd like to ask the employees here some questions...Gumshoe:
Sure thing, pal. Go wherever you like. Of course, you're not going to find any clues I haven't already found! Hah hah hah!Phoenix:
(I'm glad someone around here seems to be enjoying themselves.)Maya:
Nick, let's go! We've got a free pass to the place. Now's our chance to check things out!Studio - Main GateMaya:
Nick! Look! That security lady is in the guard station stuffing her face with donuts! I guess all cops like their donuts!Phoenix:
Yeah, and they're soft enough she doesn't need teeth to chew them...Oldbag:
Hey, you! Well? Are you satisfied Powers is guilty yet?Phoenix:
(Urk! She had to make my life harder by giving that photo to Detective Gumshoe...)Talk









Photographic proof







Phoenix:
Why didn't you tell us about the security photo, ma'am?
Oldbag:
Hmm? Oh, that? I just thought it would be more thrilling to talk with the detective himself! These things are important, you know. Oh, just to the left from here is the gate with the camera that took that photo. It's my job to check the photos every day, you see.




Reason for suspicion







Oldbag:
This guard station is in a central position. No matter where you go here, you pass by my station first! Now poor Hammer, he went to the studio just before 1:00. The murder happened right around 2:30, see? The only one I seen go through here between 1:00 and 2:30 was Powers himself! The security camera got a good look at him too. If he's not the one what did it, I don't know who is!
Phoenix:
Maybe... it was you?
Oldbag:
Gyah hah ha hah! Good one, sonny.
Phoenix:
(She thinks I was joking.)




Mr. Hammer







Phoenix:
Was the victim, Mr. Hammer, a popular actor?
Oldbag:
Oh, he was the biggest star in the studio!
Phoenix:
("Was"? Past tense?)
Maya:
Oh yes! He was great as the "Bearded Samurai"!
Oldbag:
That too, yes. He shone the brightest! Back in the day. Making a star like him play the "Evil Magistrate"... It's a disgrace, I tell you! Hammer took it pretty hard, and who can blame him?




Automatic camera (appears after "Photographic proof")







Phoenix:
About the security camera...
Oldbag:
Oh yes, the camera. It's automatic. It can tell when someone walks through that gate, see? Then it snaps a photo! Apparently, it records the time when it takes a picture too. But I don't bother myself with those details. I just view all the photos on the computer over in the security guard station. I check 'em every day before going home, I do.October 16Wright & Co. Law OfficesMaya:
What's going on, Nick!? Powers said he was sleeping in his dressing room! But now there's a photo of him going to the studio!?Phoenix:
Don't look at me! How should I know?Talk









What to do







Phoenix:
What do you think?
Maya:
That photo the detective was talking about is the problem here.
Phoenix:
Well, that's hard to say, without seeing the actual photo ourselves. But if it is Powers in that photo, his alibi is shot.




Photographic proof







Phoenix:
Only one person went to the scene of the crime before the murder took place. And there's a photograph to prove it.
Maya:
I guess it makes sense that that person is the killer then. What do we do, Nick?
Phoenix:
Maybe there was someone else who could have gone to the scene other than Powers? Let's take a look. Maybe that security lady missed someone?
Maya:
On thing's for sure, if there are any clues, they'll be in that studio.October 16Detention CenterVisitor's RoomPhoenix:
...Maya:
Apparently they have Mr. Powers in questioning.Phoenix:
Hmm... right.Gumshoe:
Look pal, that camera takes a picture automatically whenever someone walks by. And it took a picture of Will Powers!Phoenix:
I have to ask him about that photograph!Maya:
Oh well. Let's try again later.Examine









Security guard







Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He must get pretty bored. I bet he's making funny faces at that camera.October 16Global StudiosEmployee AreaMaya:
Nick! This is where they do all the behind-the-scenes stuff! Hey! Look! There's Powers's dressing room! No one's here this soon after the murder I guess. Let's take a look around!Examine









Bicycle







Phoenix:
Looks like one of those electric-powered bicycles. I dunno about these. I mean, what's the point?
Maya:
It makes it a lot easier to go up hills!
Phoenix:
Don't people cycle to get exercise!?




Drain grate







Phoenix:
The metal grate on the drain here has been taken off. That's a pretty big drain. A kid could fit through there, I bet.
Maya:
Yeah, if you snuck in that way you wouldn't have to pay at the gate!
Phoenix:
Well, if you want to leave that way, be my guest.
Maya:
Right! Huh? Hey! I'm not a kid!




Grate







Phoenix:
The grate that used to cover the drain. It's a little bent. I don't think it would fit if I tried to put it back on.




Lunch table







Phoenix:
The remains of yesterday's lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak.
Maya:
Mmm! T-bone steak! That would have hit the spot.
Phoenix:
You just had a burger!
Maya:
Yeah, but I have a second stomach just for steaks.
Phoenix:
(What!?)




Stage backdrop







Phoenix:
There's a half-finished backdrop for a stage here. Looks like a castle. Probably "Neo Olde Tokyo Castle."




Dressing room door







Phoenix:
The door to the dressing room. It's not locked.
Maya:
Hey, Nick! Let's take a look inside! Maybe we can find something as a souvenir...?
Phoenix:
What do you mean "find"!?
Maya:
You never know! There might be something like... the Samurai Spear!
Phoenix:
We don't need a spear! (And that's the murder weapon for crying out loud!)




Dressing room sign







Phoenix:
There's a sign on the dressing room door. "Mr. Will Powers"... it must be neat to be the star and have your own room like this.




Dressing room window







Phoenix:
A window into the dressing room. The glass is frosted, so I can't see inside.




Storage room door







Phoenix:
That must be the storage room. That's where they keep all the film equipment.
Maya:
Wow, Nick! You know a lot about the industry!
Phoenix:
Umm, what else would they keep in a film studio?




Vending machine







Phoenix:
Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks or something. Popcorn, at least!
Maya:
W-wait! Look! "Samurai Soda"! Nick! Try this!
Phoenix:

(Powers's dressing room... So this is where he was sleeping? Or at least, this is where he claims he was sleeping.)Maya:
No one actually saw him taking a nap here, did they?Phoenix:
Right, and there's a picture of him near the crime scene. (I hope he's telling the truth... for his sake!)Examine









Cosmetics







Phoenix:
There's a vast array of cosmetics here.
Maya:
Ooh! This is the wig he used in "Samurai Boogey-Woogey"! Nick! Try this on!
Phoenix:
No. And how can you tell the name of a show just by looking at a wig!?
Maya:
I, um, kinda like samurai movies.
Phoenix:
("Kinda"...?)




Costume rack







Phoenix:
There's some regular suits in among the costumes here. Those must be his own clothes.
Maya:
It'd be fun to wear one of the costumes...
Phoenix:
(I'd say you were already wearing one, myself.)




Couch







Phoenix:
Looks like someone was sleeping here. Maybe Powers did take a nap here yesterday...




Mirror







Phoenix:
They always have mirrors like this in dressing rooms. I see my hair is still nice and spiky, just how I like it.




Bag







Maya:
Hmm? This must be Powers's bag.
Phoenix:
Hey, don't open that.
Maya:
Look!
Phoenix:
An employee cardkey. That must be Powers's. It says "Studio One."
Maya:
Let's take it, Nick!
Phoenix:
Borrow it. You mean borrow.
Cardkey added to the Court Record.




Bag (subsequent times)







Maya:
I wonder what else is inside Powers's bag...?
Phoenix:
Stop that! (My partner, the thief in training.)




Table







Phoenix:
There's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Some tea and cookies...
Maya:
Nick... I'm hungry!
Phoenix:
You just had a burger!
Maya:
Yeah, but I have a separate stomach for sweets!
Phoenix:
(How many stomachs does this girl have!?)

Phoenix:
It's locked. Looks like he doesn't open his window much. I guess it is kind of dusty outside.Wright & Co. Law OfficesPresent

Cardkey







Phoenix:
Could you tell me about this, ma'am?
Oldbag:
Oh that! Isn't that a studio cardkey? You better watch it! The scene of a murder is no place for sightseeing! I'll be taking that! Hand it over!
Phoenix:
W-wait! No, that's mine!
Oldbag:
Look, I don't have a cardkey to the studio, see? I want to go pay my respects to Jack Hammer where he died.

Studio One entrance







Phoenix:
The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.

Director's chair







Maya:
Hey! Look! That's the chair the director sits in! I've always wanted to sit in one of these. Hey Nick, take a look at that. One of those black-and-white boards they clap at the start of filming! And look! A megaphone! A real live megaphone!
Phoenix:

Maya:
Ready, Nick? Action!

(This girl is more troubled than I thought...)




Film camera







Leads to:
"Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!"




Reflecting screen







Maya:
What's this?
Phoenix:
That's for reflecting light. They call it a reflecting screen or something like that. The assistant holds it during filming.
Maya:
Huh.
Phoenix:
What? Where's your enthusiasm for all things entertainment?
Maya:
Well, lighting is fine, but I'd want to be the director. Or maybe the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
(I think she's being serious...!)




Stage backdrop







Phoenix:
Looks like a backdrop for a stage. This must be used in the Steel Samurai show.
Maya:
Of course! That's the mountain, Neo Fujiyama!
Phoenix:
Doesn't the Steel Samurai take place in Olde Tokyo? Can you even see Mt. Fuji from there?
Maya:
Not Olde Tokyo, Nick! "Neo" Olde Tokyo!
Phoenix:
Oh. Right.

Maya:
Look, a ladder!
Phoenix:
That's a "step"-ladder.
Maya:
So? What's the difference? You need to stop judging things based on narrow-minded cultural assumptions, Nick!
Phoenix:
R-right... sorry. (This girl is OUT there!)




Tape outline







Phoenix:
They outlined where Jack Hammer's body lay with tape. His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. I guess that's why the head part looks like a helmet. Funny, I expected a spear stabbing would leave at least a few bloodstains. I guess the costume must have absorbed most of it...Maya:
Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!Phoenix:
Yeah! So don't touch it!Maya:
Whoa! It's heavier than I thought...???:
Hey! You! No touching that!Phoenix:
Ah, um, sorry, my partner is kind of, y'know...Maya:
"Y'know"!? No I don't know!Phoenix:

We're lawyers representing Mr. Will Powers.Penny:
Oh, you're WP's people.Maya:
"WP"...? Oh, Will Powers. W.P., I get it.Penny:
I don't envy you guys one bit! But... do what you can for WP, okay? He'd never hurt a fly! He has to be innocent.Maya:
Don't worry, leave it to us!Talk









The day of the crime







Phoenix:
Could you tell me anything about the day of the murder?
Penny:
Yes. I was in the studio the whole day. I was the only assistant on staff that day, you see.
Maya:
Only one assistant!?
Penny:
Yes, well, the studios isn't doing so well right now. (Changed from [Yes, well, the studios aren't doing so well right now.] in the original release) And yesterday was only rehearsal for our action sequences.
Maya:
Oh, I see. (Changed from [I see. Neat!] in the original release)
Penny:
In the morning we went through the action sequences in the employee area. WP and Hammer were there, along with everyone else.
Phoenix:
The employee area--that's where Powers's dressing room is, right?
Penny:
Yes, that's the place. After eating lunch there, Mr. Hammer went to Studio One. Then I saw WP go into his dressing room. But I didn't see either of them after that.




Will Powers







Phoenix:
Did you know that Mr. Powers was sleeping in his room?
Penny:
No! I wouldn't go in there unless I had some urgent message for him... I mean, it's his private... What kind of a girl do you think I am!?
Phoenix:
W-what kind...? No, no, I'm sure you're a fine girl. Um, sorry. (So much for getting a confirmation of Powers's alibi.)Present









Anything







Phoenix:
Um, any thoughts about this?
Penny:
Sorry... I... don't really want to think too much about what happened just yet.After clearing all Talk options:Maya:
What do we do, Nick? We haven't found anything. If WP was the only one who came to the studio... Then he has to be the killer! They even have a photograph...Phoenix:
Hmm...Penny:

Not really.Penny:
Actually, there's been something bothering me.Maya:
Ah hah! That's what I'm talking about! A clue! A lead!Penny:
Well, I don't know about that, but that day, just after noon, I sensed someone was here...Phoenix:
You "sensed"?Penny:
Yes, several times.Phoenix:
Some other studio employees, maybe?Penny:
No, I don't think so. The only thing we had scheduled was an action scene run-through. I was the only assistant here that day. I have a feeling it was someone from... outside.Phoenix:
R-really!?Maya:
But wait, if someone had come in here... Wouldn't that security lady have noticed them?Phoenix:
Yeah, you're right.Penny:
I'm sorry I don't have any better information than that.Maya:
No, thanks! That helps us a lot. Anything helps. Let's go put that security lady on the spot!Talk









Sensing someone







Phoenix:
So you sensed that someone other than the regular film crew was in the studio?
Penny:
Yes... I think.

What? I saw that suspicious look on your face!Phoenix:
I wanted to ask you again about yesterday... You came here at 1:00 PM, correct? And the estimated time of Hammer's death was 2:30. Are you sure that Powers was the only one to go through here between those times?Oldbag:
Sure as can be!Maya:
But we have a witness who thinks there was "someone from outside" here that day.Oldbag:
What!?Maya:
Are you absolutely sure you were here watching the whole time?Oldbag:

Ma'am?Oldbag:
Who was it? Who told you that? Who dares question ME!?Maya:

Alright you better tell me and tell me quick, you spiky-haired cretin! Someone's been complaining about the work I do, eh!?Maya:
Uh... um, we were just talking to the assistant in Studio One.Oldbag:
Her! She's not even a full-time employee! All you young'uns are like that nowadays, running your mouths like there was no tomorrow saying this that and the other thing. Well when I was young let me tell you we knew a thing or two about respecting our elders. Back then we did and it's a crying shame that you youths today just say what you please about poor old ladies Graaaaaaaaaaaawr!Phoenix:

Well, Nick? This is our chance to do what we can without her looking over our shoulders!Examine









Computer







Phoenix:
The computer that runs the studio security cameras.

Phoenix:
Yeah, maybe. (Should I try the computer?)



Try it







Phoenix:
Okay. Let's give it a try.
Maya:
You know how to work these things, Nick?
Phoenix:
Looks like I just have to enter in a few numbers. Let's see... first, I need the date of the murder. (It looks like the camera turned on at 1:00 PM that day... 1:00... That was when the security lady arrived at the guard station.)
[Please enter the number of the security camera.]

Hey! Why do I have to be the villain.Maya:
Relax, it was just a joke! So, are we done for today?Phoenix:

Part 6October 18, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:
Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth:
The prosecution will show the court that at 2:30 PM on October 15, the defendant, Mr. Will Powers, killed fellow actor Jack Hammer at Studio One of Global Studios. It is impossible for anyone else to have committed this heinous crime. The evidence presented during the trial will all point to this fact.Judge:
Hmm. I see. Very well, I would like to move on to your testimony. Mr. Edgeworth, the prosecution may call its first witness.Edgeworth:
Very well, I call a most familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand. (Changed from [First, I would like to call a familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand.] in the original release)Edgeworth:
Detective, if you would briefly describe this case to the court?Gumshoe:
Yes sir! I'll explain with the guidemap here. To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see? This here is the Employee Area. The actors did a run-through of their action scenes during the morning here. This is the main gate to the studios. The security lady that works at the studios was here at 1:00 PM on that day. Past the security station there is a gate, see? Past that are the studios. And here it is... Studio One. This is the scene of the murder, where the body was found! Now, on the day of the murder, October 15, there were only three people here. The victim, Jack Hammer, the defendant, Will Powers, and a young woman, the production assistant. All the production staff were in the Employee Area until noon. Then after lunch, the victim, Jack Hammer, went to Studio One. Right after that, at 1:00 PM, the security lady got to the guard station. Now, jump ahead to later that day... 5:00 PM. The production staff came to Studio One to perform a rehearsal. Needless to say, the rehearsal was cancelled... The time of death was 2:30 PM. The "Samurai Spear" found lodged in the victim's chest was the murder weapon. That's the case, in brief. Anyone like to hear that again?Phoenix:
(Hmm... should I listen to that whole thing again...?)Skip it







Leads to:
"I think I can probably remember that..."Listen again







Phoenix:
I'm sorry, could you describe that one more time?
Gumshoe:
I shoulda known it would be you, pal! Fine. Once more for the mentally-challenged lawyer.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, yeah. Live it up while you can, Gumshoe.)
Leads back to:
"To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see?"Phoenix:
(I think I can probably remember that...)Judge:
So the murder weapon was a "spear"? How... medieval!Samurai Spear added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:
Your Honor. This case is quite simple if you ask one question: And that question is: "What did the security lady at the guard station see?"Judge:
Understood.Edgeworth:
Let's call this security officer to the stand!Edgeworth:
Will the witness declare her name?Oldbag:
... Hmm? My, aren't you a handsome fellow! I'm afraid I'm a bit flustered!Edgeworth:
Y-your name, please!Oldbag:
Oh, dearie! No need for you to be embarrassed! Just call me "grandma."Edgeworth:
YOUR NAME, PLEASE!Phoenix:
(Seems Edgeworth has a bit of trouble getting his witnesses to say their names...)Oldbag:
Wendy Oldbag, dearie. So just call me "grandma." It's practically my name! So even when I was young I was an Oldbag, but not really that was just my name dearie. Still how the other children would make fun of me and just because of my name can you believe it? But there was this boy, the captain of the chess club in junior high, and when he called me an old bag well I just cried and cried because I had a crush on him you see--Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
O-objection! I... object to the witness's talkativeness.Judge:
Objection sustained! The witness will refrain from rambling on the stand.Oldbag:
I was just getting to the good part, dearie!Edgeworth:
Perhaps we can get to the testimony?Judge:
Now, the witness was stationed at the main gate on the day of the murder, correct?Oldbag:
Yessey I was.Judge:
And to get to the scene of the murder, someone would have to pass by you?Oldbag:
You know your stuff, dearie!Judge:
... You may begin your testimony.Phoenix:
(She sure is one hell of an Oldbag...)Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Oldbag:
On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.
Poor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.
I, well, I had some errands to run that morning.
Anyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.
I was at the main gate from then until 5:00!
Now, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?
Interesting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.
It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!Judge:
You saw the defendant, then? Hmm... Very well. Let's begin the cross-examination. Mr. Wright?Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.Cross Examination-- Witness's Account --Oldbag:
On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So up until that time, anyone who wanted to could go into the studio?
Oldbag:
Well, there wasn't a security guard at the gate, no. But the main gate was locked, dearie. You'd need an employee cardkey to get in.
Phoenix:
(Right... the cardkey that I have. So, what she's saying is no one who wasn't supposed to be there could get in.)
Edgeworth:
Was there anyone at the studios when you arrived at the guard station?Oldbag:
Poor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
A "run-through"...?
Oldbag:
They were working out a scene between the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate. They got the basics figured out by noon, and were to use the afternoon for practice. Rehearsal was supposed to start at 5:00. That's why poor old Hammer went to Studio One in the afternoon.
Phoenix:
(So Powers was in his dressing room sleeping... when he was supposed to be practicing! Talk about a laid-back hero...)
Edgeworth:
If there was a run-through in the morning, why did you only get there after noon?Oldbag:
I, well, I had some errands to run that morning.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What kind of "errands"?
Oldbag:
Oh, well, you know.
Phoenix:
Answer the question!
Oldbag:
Actually... I was watching poor Hammer and Powers. Observing, you know?
Phoenix:
O-observing? Weren't you supposed to be at the guard station?
Oldbag:
Whippersnapper! I told you I locked the gate, didn't I? I did my job!
Phoenix:
(I'm not sure your boss would see it that way...)
Oldbag:
Anyway! I always watch Hammer's run-throughts. Always! Never missed one in all my years.
Maya:
Wow! I want to see a Steel Samurai run-through too!
Phoenix:
You could quit being a spirit medium and take up guard duty.

Not a bad idea...Oldbag:

Did you see the victim then?
Oldbag:
Did I see poor old Hammer? Nope. He'd already gone to the studio before I got back to the guard station.

No, it's just, after seeing you eating those donuts in the guard station yesterday...

I can watch the gate and eat donuts at the same time! Snipperwhapper!

Now, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?Press







Phoenix:

J-just a moment, Mr. Wright. Let me see that photo! ... What is this, exactly?Phoenix:
None other than the Steel Samurai, defender of Neo Olde Tokyo. Ms. Oldbag! Is this the "Mr. Powers" that you saw!?Oldbag:
Of course! Didn't your momma teach you any sense, sonny? Anyone can plainly see that's Powers! Right?Edgeworth:
No, they can't! (Changed from [Um, yeah.] in the original release) ... Umm... well. I mean, I wonder? (Changed from [Umm... well. I wonder?] in the original release)Phoenix:

Yes! And to think, he's supposed to be the Steel Samurai! What a laugh! So Powers sprained his ankle. I helped make it better for him, of course.

I kissed it where it hurt.

Umm... hmm. Actually, well... We couldn't find it. We're looking, though.Judge:

Hmm... I suppose that's right.Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Hold it right there! We keep talking possibilities, but we have to agree that this photo shows the Steel Samurai! Nowhere in this photo can we see Mr. Will Powers!

Hmm... The defense has a point. I also wonder if someone else not caught on camera could have killed Mr. Hammer. We have to consider that possibility, also.

Then allow me to remove that doubt from your mind, Your Honor...

Phoenix:

I suppose, since there weren't any additional crew members at the studios that day... It's quite likely that it was the defendant inside that costume. I see no problem with this evidence.

The prosecution's thoughts are simple. Nothing has changed. The other person who went to the studios was a boy of roughly 10 years of age. The photo we do have may not be hard evidence... But there is still no one else that could have committed this crime! I call for a verdict of "guilty" for the defendant, Mr. Will Powers!Judge:

The defense disagrees with the prosecution's claim. There IS another person who could have committed this crime!Judge:

(Right. Great. As if the stakes weren't high enough.)Judge:
So, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder?The assistant girl







Phoenix:
It was the assistant! The Steel Samurai costume was in his dressing room. She stole it, and in doing so she became the Steel Samurai!
Judge:
So you're saying the Steel Samurai in the picture is really the assistant?
Phoenix:
That's correct, Your Honor!

If you're serious, you've got guts, Mr. Wright. Remember the photo? Wasn't the Steel Samurai a little lame!? He was dragging his foot!

Remember the testimony concerning Powers's injury!!!


Oldbag:
Powers and poor Hammer were at the run-through. Oh, and me.

What about the assistant?
Oldbag:
Oh, her? She was cleaning up backdrops, I think. She didn't know about Powers's ankle.

The assistant knew nothing of Mr. Power's injury! She could look the Steel Samurai look with that costume... But she couldn't walk the the Steel Samurai walk! She wouldn't have limped!

Ms. Oldbag was standing guard alone at the main gate. She was by herself... in other words, she has no alibi! She could have briefly left her post to steal the the Steel Samurai costume... Then slipped into Studio One, the scene of the murder!Judge:
W-why would she go through the trouble of wearing the Steel Samurai costume!?Phoenix:
Simple, Your Honor. She knew the camera at the gate would take her picture. If she was in his costume, she could point the finger at Mr. Powers!Judge:
I see! Excellent deductive reasoning, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:

The scene of the murder, as we all know, was Studio One. However, you need a cardkey to enter Studio One! How could a boy with no formal relation to the studios have a cardkey!?

Your Honor! The murder weapon was the Samurai Spear. That very spear is shown here in this photo. How could the boy have taken the spear? It's impossible!

Phoenix:
This is my proof!
Judge:

Phoenix:
S-sorry, Your Honor.

I'll ask again, Mr. Wright.

Very well! This court will suspend proceedings on the current trial for today. Mr. Edgeworth, please find out more about your witness, Ms. Windy... what was her name?Edgeworth:
Something "Oldbag," Your Honor.Judge:
Then the prosecution will look further into this Oldbag before we continue! That is all. The court is adjourned!Oldbag:

Oh, great, stop the presses! The windbag wants to talk!Judge:
Ms. Oldbag! What is this all about? Have you omitted something from your testimony?Oldbag:
Actually, if you must know, there's something I was told not to talk about.Phoenix:
N-not to talk about?Edgeworth:
By whom!?Phoenix:
(Huh? You mean it wasn't Edgeworth who told her not to talk...?)Judge:
W-well, testify!Witness Testimony-- My Lips Were Sealed --Oldbag:
Global Studios wanted me to keep quiet about something.
There were... some other people at the studios on the day of the murder.
They said they had "nothing to do with it," see?
So they told me to just pretend they "hadn't been at the studios that day."
But if you're going to go accusing me, I'm not letting them get away scot free!Judge:
M-Ms. Oldbag! This is crucial information! Why did you keep this from the court until now!?Oldbag:

Oldbag:

Edgeworth:
We should have known something was fishy! How could they have done a run-through of their action scene without a director? Of course!
Oldbag:
Yes, well, I was surprised no one asked about it.
Phoenix:
So, where were these people?
Oldbag:
The director was in the Employee Area all morning for the run-through. He joined the producer around lunchtime and they had a meeting after that.
Edgeworth:
Where!
Oldbag:
Oh, in the Studio Two trailer.
Phoenix:
S-Studio Two...!? (There was a Studio Two...?)
Oldbag:
Well, if you look at the guidemap... Here it is. You go through the gate and all the way to the left.

Your Honor. We have learned there were others at Global Studios on the day in question. The director and the producer and, er, some bigwigs, were all present. Yet, as we stand here, they have not been questioned! I hold that it is impossible to declare a verdict on the defendant, Mr. Powers!Judge:
Hmm... The court acknowledges the defense's point. The prosecution will gather more information about the witness, Ms. Oldbag... and more information about these other people we have just been told of!Edgeworth:

We'll be going down to the studios to do some more investigation. We have to find out more about this director and producer. They'll be turning up in the next trial as witnesses for certain. So now's my chance to get material for the cross-examination!Maya:
So, Nick... Have we figured out just who it was in that Steel Samurai costume? Could it really have been old windbag?Phoenix:
What do you think, Mr. Powers?Will:
I don't think it was her, really.Maya:
Neither do I, Nick.Phoenix:
Y-yeah, I know! Look, I was just buying time back there. Someone had to be the bad guy for a bit to take the pressure off Mr. Powers.Maya:

Judge:
That's enough! This court see no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for mis-interpretation of the facts.

Whew, what a day.Maya:
This is no time for relaxing, Nick! Say, you think WP's got a chance?Phoenix:
I guess that really depends on the people we found out about in today's trial.Maya:
The director and producer...?Phoenix:
Yeah, them.Maya:
Well, what are we doing here then!? Let's get to the studios!Talk









What to do







Phoenix:
What do you think we should do?
Maya:
W-what do I... huh!? Why don't we do what you just said!? We gotta get the scoop on this director and producer.
Phoenix:
Oh, right. Then there's no point hanging out here.
Maya:
That's what I've been saying! Let's get to those studios pronto!




Any ideas







Maya:
Hmm. We don't have enough information to make a case yet.
Phoenix:
That's exactly the same thing you said yesterday! Just admit it: you don't have a clue what happened.
Maya:
There's not enough information!Present









Attorney's Badge







Phoenix:
Hey, see this?
Maya:
You... really like showing that off, don't you, Nick?




Cardkey







Maya:
Hey, you still have that! Great!
Phoenix:
Well, we couldn't get into the scene of the murder without it. And its owner isn't missing it in his detention cell...
Maya:
Poor old WP...




Powers's(?) Photo







Maya:
You know, what if this really was Mr. Powers?
Phoenix:
Yeah. It's hard to say. We don't really know anyone else it could be. I seriously doubt it was that old windbag.
Maya:
So Mr. Powers is... lying?
Phoenix:
He really doesn't seem the type, does he. (Curiouser and curiouser...)




Samurai Spear







Maya:
I wish I had my own Samurai Spear! You'd by my own personal pincushion, Nick!
Phoenix:
Me!? Why me!?




Anything else







Maya:
Sorry, I don't know how that will help us figure this out.October 18Detention CenterVisitor's RoomWill:
Oh, Mr. Wright! Thank you for earlier.Phoenix:
Not at all. We got lucky, to tell the truth.Maya:
You can say that again!Phoenix:
Let's not.Maya:
So, WP! Do you have any leads that might get us going in the right direction?Will:
Hmm... S-sorry, but no.Maya:
Be sure to tell us anything that comes to mind, no matter how small.Phoenix:
We can't rely on getting lucky again tomorrow.Will:
Y-yes... *sniff*Examine









Security guard







Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room.Talk









The fanboy







Phoenix:
Do, er, "fanboys" sneak into the studios often?
Will:
No, not that I know of. That security lady's pretty strict with them.
Maya:
But, in today's testimony, didn't she say they were often hanging around?
Will:
The kids really, really love the Steel Samurai. They sneak past when she's not looking, I guess.




The director







Phoenix:
Was the director present at the morning run-through?
Will:
Y-yes, yes he was. He was directing how the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate should move.
Maya:
Why didn't you tell us that before!?
Will:
W-well, just, the studio asked us to keep quiet...
Maya:
That has nothing to do with this! I hate to repeat myself, but Nick here is a newbie lawyer! Fresh off the bar! When he loses, he's going to lose big!
Will:
I... I see. *sniff*
Phoenix:
(Whose side is she on!?)
Maya:
You aren't hiding anything else from us, are you!?
Will:
N-no, I sure hope not.Present









Cardkey







Phoenix:
We found this cardkey in your dressing room.
Will:
Oh, that's mine, yes.
Maya:
Can people outside the studios get these cards?
Will:
I don't think so. Even I have to return the card. Once the show's done filming, that is.
Maya:
Huh...




Powers's(?) Photo







Phoenix:
Regarding this photograph...
Will:
Y-yes...?
Phoenix:
This really, truly, absolutely isn't you, right?
Will:
R-right. *sniff* I was sleeping in my dressing room the whole time, honest.
Phoenix:
But who else could have worn it!?
Maya:
Your costume was in your dressing room?
Will:
Yes. I guess they snuck in and took it while I was asleep.
Phoenix:
(But who!?)




Samurai Spear







Phoenix:
Regarding the murder weapon...
Will:
Yes?
Phoenix:
Is it heavy, that spear?
Will:
It's pretty hefty, yeah. I don't think the average person would be able to swing it around effectively.
Phoenix:
Hmm...
Maya:
And... that's the spear that broke or something during the morning run-through?
Will:
Oh yes, I goofed on a round kick, you see... I broke the spear. The security lady fixed it for me right away though.
Maya:
With duct tape. We heard.




Anything else







Will:
E-excuse me. Thank you for showing me that, whatever it is. I wish I could think of some way I could help you... S-sorry. *sniff*October 18, 2:16 PMGlobal StudiosMain GateMaya:
No one's here.Phoenix:
Right, now that they have Ms. Oldbag in custody. I guess they don't have anyone else to replace her...Maya:
H-hey! In the guard station! Look! She left her donuts! ... ... What? I wasn't going to eat them!Examine









Computer







Phoenix:
The computer that runs the studio security cameras. Huh? It looks like it's been turned off for the day.




Guard station







Phoenix:
The security guard station. Ms. Oldbag must like junk food. There's a mountain of it on the desk in there.




Main gate







Phoenix:
The main entrance to the studios. They probably have a police officer on patrol out there.October 18Studio One EntranceMaya:
Hey, Nick. It looks like Detective Gumshoe isn't here today.Phoenix:
You're right. He's probably up to his neck in paperwork after the commotion at today's trial.Maya:
So, Nick... Remember that "Studio Two" we heard about at the trial today? It was down that path with the fallen tree, right?Phoenix:
Yeah, I think that's what they said.Maya:
Maybe the director and the rest of them are there today? Now's our chance, Nick! Let's check it out!Examine









Bench







Phoenix:
I'm bushed. Maybe I'll sit down here for a bit.
Maya:
This is exactly why I don't want to get old, ever.
Phoenix:
H-hey! I'm still young! I'm just tired!
Maya:
Nick, when you start having to say "I'm still young," you know it's all over.
Phoenix:
(But... but I AM still young!)




Left path







Phoenix:
In the trial, they said Studio Two was down this path. The monkey head is in the way, but we should be able to get by it without a problem.
Maya:
This monkey head is real heavy!
Phoenix:
Well, it did knock that tree over when it fell.
Maya:
Both of these, the monkey head and the tree, fell the day of the murder, didn't they.
Phoenix:
Yeah, that's what Detective Gumshoe said.




Statue with broken head







Phoenix:
The studio mascot. Apparently it's a monkey of some kind. I've never seen a monkey with a nose like that before!
Maya:
Why don't they put his head back on? Maybe we should ask that assistant?
Phoenix:
I'm not sure we really want her fixing anything. And you'd probably need a crane to move that thing.
Maya:
Probably so.




Security camera







Phoenix:
That's the security camera that automatically takes pictures of people here. It took two pictures on the day of the murder, before the actual time of death. One of them was the Steel Samurai. The other was a grade school boy. It doesn't seem to be switched on today.




Studio One entrance







Phoenix:
The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.




Welcome sign







Maya:
It says "Welcome."
Phoenix:
They let people in here when they're not filming, right?
Maya:
Nick! Let's come here some day! Whaddya say?
Phoenix:
Sure, if that security lady lets us in.October 18Studio OneMaya:
I... don't really want to be in here.Phoenix:
Yeah... It is a murder scene.Maya:
I want to go someplace else. Nick?Phoenix:
(*sigh*...)Examine









Film camera







Maya:
Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!
Phoenix:
Yeah! So don't touch it!
Maya:
Hey, smile, Nick, you're a star!
Phoenix:
S-stop that!




Reflecting screen







Phoenix:
That's for reflecting light. They call it a reflecting screen or something like that.
Maya:
Huh.
Phoenix:
What? Where's your enthusiasm for all things entertainment?
Maya:
Well, lighting is fine, but I'd want to be the director. Or maybe the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
(I think she's being serious...!)




Stage backdrop







Phoenix:
Looks like a backdrop for a stage. This must be used in the Steel Samurai show.
Maya:
Of course! That's the mountain, Neo Fujiyama!
Phoenix:
Doesn't the Steel Samurai take place in Olde Tokyo? Can you even see Mt. Fuji from there?
Maya:
Not Olde Tokyo, Nick! "Neo" Olde Tokyo!October 18Studio Two EntranceMaya:
This... is Studio Two?Phoenix:
I thought so...Maya:
It doesn't really look much like a "studio," does it?Phoenix:
No, that it does not.Maya:
Hey... There's a trailer over there.Phoenix:
It looks pretty sturdy for a movie set trailer.Maya:
Are we sure this is a studio?Examine









Incinerator







Phoenix:
An incinerator. Apparently they just put this one in. It's already covered in soot. They must not clean it much.




Lunch table







Phoenix:
Looks like two people ate here. There's nothing left on the plates.
Maya:
Hey, so they ate t-bone steaks too.
Phoenix:
What is it with steaks around here?
Maya:
Hey! There's always room for steak! But... something does seem out of place...
Phoenix:
What?
Maya:
I... don't know. It just feels "odd."




Number "2" sign







Phoenix:
There's a big "2" painted here.
Maya:
Probably because this is Studio Two?
Phoenix:
Probably... Though it doesn't look anything like a studio.




Studio van







Phoenix:
A light van for moving staff and equipment around. They've kept it in pretty good shape. Looks like it'd run fine.
Maya:
Well, let's go for a drive!
Phoenix:
Sure... if I had a license.
Maya:
Nick! You don't have a driver's license!?
Phoenix:
But, look, I have this!
Maya:
Why are you showing me your attorney's badge, Nick?




Flower garden







Phoenix:
There're some flowers here.
Maya:
Wow, so pretty! They're taking good care of these.
Phoenix:
Don't get to [sic] close. That fence looks dangerous.




Storage materials







Phoenix:
These look like materials for making a movie set.
Maya:
They've been sitting here for quite some time. This might as well be a junkyard.




Trailer







Phoenix:
On closer inspection, this trailer looks like it's been here for a while. I don't think this is part of some temporary film set.




Trailer door







Maya:
Nick! Let's go inside!
Phoenix:
You think it's okay...? Oh well. It's locked.
Maya:
Aww... shucks.October 18Global StudiosEmployee AreaMaya:
Look, it's that assistant girl. Hey!Penny:
Hi... WP's lawyers, right? I heard about the trial! Great job, guys!Phoenix:
Oh? Oh hoh hoh. Don't mention it.Penny:
Is it true they caught the security lady!?Phoenix:
Oh! Oh... oh hoh hoh!Penny:
Actually, she just called me. She told me to cover up that drain...Phoenix:
You mean that one? (Wow, what a mess...)Penny:
I... I know... I'm not so good with handiwork. Some assistant, right?Maya:
Yeah, but you do work on the props, and the backdrops, right?Penny:
R-right. Just... lots of times they end up looking worse than they did before I fixed them.Maya:
Oh? Oh! Well, I'm sure these things happen. Nothing to worry yourself about!Penny:
You're right! I won't!Phoenix:
(Personally, I think she should worry at least a little bit more...)Penny:
Um, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to the guard station. I'm supposed to fill in for Ms. Oldbag.Maya:
Right! See you later, then!Penny:
Good luck with your investigation.Examine









Taped cardboard barrier







Maya:
So, the fanboy they were talking about in the trial today... He came in through that drain?
Phoenix:
So it seems. I guess they covered it up in a hurry.
Maya:
Hey... Hey, Nick! If that drain's covered, the boy won't be able to get in.
Phoenix:
Uh, yeah. I think that was the idea...?
Maya:
I feel kinda sorry for him, though. Don't you?
Phoenix:
What, you want to rip the grate off?
Maya:
Really, Nick? We can!?
Phoenix:
(Whoa... she's serious? Uh oh...)



Rip it open







Phoenix:
Well, I guess some things are just made to be broken.
Maya:
Yay! You know, Nick, you're pretty swell sometimes.
Phoenix:
(Sometimes...?)
Maya:
Hiii-ya! There. That should make the kids happy.
Phoenix:
The things we do...
Leads back to examination




Leave it be







Phoenix:
Nah, I think we should leave it on. They only just repaired it. And if we take it off, that assistant will get yelled at by you-know-who.
Maya:
Yeah... I guess so.
Phoenix:
(Wow! I didn't expect her to take it that hard...)
Leads back to examination





Drain grate (after selecting "Rip it open" upon examining taped cardboard barrier)







Phoenix:
The drain grate is off. And I know who did it.
Maya:
Now the kids'll be able to come in again. Doesn't it make you feel great to do a good deed like that?
Phoenix:
(Must be nice to live so free of guilt.)




Lunch table







Phoenix:
The remains of yesterday's lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak.




Dressing room door







Phoenix:
The door to the dressing room. It's not locked.
Maya:
Hey, Nick! Let's go in! Maybe there'll be something else to steal?
Phoenix:
H-hey! We're not thieves!
Maya:
But we did take that cardkey...
Phoenix:
W-we borrowed that! There's a difference.




Vending machine







Phoenix:
Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks or something. Popcorn, at least!
Maya:
W-wait! Look! "Samurai Soda"! Nick! Try this!
Phoenix:
Be my guest.
Maya:
Okay! Oh, too bad, it's sold out.October 18Global StudiosDressing RoomMaya:
This is where the Steel Samurai costume was, on the day of the murder.Phoenix:
That's what Mr. Powers says, at least. I guess they snuck in and took it while he was sleeping.Maya:
But Nick, what if Mr. Powers hadn't been sleeping? I wonder what the killer was planning on doing then?Phoenix:
Huh... (She's got a point!)Examine









Cosmetics







Phoenix:
There's an array of cosmetics here. According to Maya, that wig was used in some old TV show...
Maya:
"Samurai Boogey-Woogey," Nick! Get with the picture!
Phoenix:
Look, explain to me how you can identify a show just by seeing a wig!?
Maya:
I, um, kinda like samurai movies.
Phoenix:
("Kinda"...?)




Costume rack







Phoenix:
There's some regular suits in among the costumes here. Those must be Mr. Powers's personal clothes.




Couch







Phoenix:
Looks like someone was sleeping here. Maybe Powers did take a nap here, like he said.




Bag







Maya:
Mr. Powers's bag. I wonder what's inside? Hey! Supermarket tabloids? Wow. I'm kind of shocked.
Phoenix:
Maya! Leave those alone! (Wolf Men Found On Mars...? I'll have to buy that issue!)




Table







Phoenix:
There's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Some tea and cookies...
Maya:
Wait... Nick!
Phoenix:
W-what now?
Maya:
These snacks... they've passed the expiration date!
Phoenix:
... Then don't eat them.
Maya:
*grumble* (They're snacks! They're meant to be eaten!)




Window







Phoenix:
It's locked. I guess he doesn't open his window much. It is kind of dusty outside.Studio - Main Gate (after selecting "Rip it open" upon examining taped cardboard barrier in Global Studios - Employee Area)Penny:
Oh... hello.Maya:
Ho hoh! You look a little out of place.Penny:
It's the clothes, isn't it? I thought my camo vest might do the trick... Kind of an "alternative guard fashion" thing.Examine









Guard station







Phoenix:
The security guard station. I can see the computer that runs the security cameras.
Penny:
Oh, please don't touch anything in there. The security lady would knock the stuffing out of me if she knew.Talk









The studios







Phoenix:
So, how are the studios doing?
Penny:
There's police wandering around everywhere, it's terrible. They won't even let me clean up. Don't want me "disturbing evidence." I haven't even cleaned up our lunch plates from the day of the murder!
Phoenix:
You mean those plates with the steak bones left over on them in the employee area?
Penny:
Yeah. Can you believe it?




The fanboy







Maya:
Do kids sneak in here a lot?
Penny:
Well... I don't think there's that many of them, but I do see one in particular a bunch. He's always gawking at the sets, or snapping pictures. You should see Old Windbag's eyes flash when she sees him. She has a bit of trouble catching him though...




The director, et al.







Phoenix:
I heard something at the trial today. They said that the director and producer were here the day of the murder...
Penny:
Oh, sorry... I was in the prop storage room, so I didn't see them. I guess they were here, though. The studio head seemed pretty eager to keep us quiet.
Maya:
So they were trying to protect the director?
Penny:
More the producer, really. The producer's our real star here. She saved these studios from the brink of disaster and kept them running. I don't think we'd still be in business if it weren't for that producer!
Phoenix:
(The producer, huh?)Present









Cardkey







Penny:
Wow, they gave a lawyer one of those cardkeys?
Phoenix:
Well, I'm sort of borrowing it.
Penny:
I see. You better be careful not to lose that. They're very strict about those cardkeys here.
Phoenix:
(I guess they're pretty good about keeping these out of outsider's hands.) Thanks, I'll be careful.




Powers's(?) Photo







Phoenix:

Penny:
That's Mr. Powers. Why is he dragging his leg like that? What is this, anyway?
Phoenix:

Samurai Spear







Phoenix:
Say, you work with the props, right? About that murder weapon...
Penny:
You mean the Samurai Spear? Yeah, it's a prop, but it's still pretty heavy. I hate having to carry that thing around.
Phoenix:
(So you'd have to be pretty strong to use that as a weapon, it sounds like. Why is Mr. Powers the only person I can think of!?)

The day of the crime







Phoenix:
Did you notice anything unusual on the day of the murder?
Manella:
Oh, I know who j00 d00dz are. That security lady told j00 about us, eh?
Phoenix:
That's right.
Manella:
It was a pretty regular day. We had a run-through for an action scene in the morning. Then a meeting from lunchtime in the Studio Two trailer. Heh. I was so busy I didn't even get a chance to eat lunch! :(
Phoenix:
A t-bone steak, was it?
Manella:
Yeah... sux0rz! I hate missing out on food...
Maya:
Nick... what does "Sucksores" mean?
Phoenix:
No idea...
Manella:
Anyway, I was in a meeting from noon till after 4:00. With the producer, and some bigwigs from the network.
Phoenix:
(Mr. Hammer's time of death was estimated at 2:30 PM. If he's telling the truth, that meeting gives him an alibi...)




The producer (appears after "The day of the crime")







Phoenix:
About the producer who was at the meeting with you...
Manella:
Oh, you mean Dee Vasquez? She's a genius. M4d sk1llz, all the way. Scary, though. *sweats* She brought these studios back from the brink of destruction. She's the one who made it possible for me to make the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
You had a meeting with her on the day of the murder, right?
Manella:
Yeah, we were together from noon to 4:00 PM, the whole time.




The bigwigs (appears after "The day of the crime")







Phoenix:
Who exactly are these "bigwigs" people keep mentioning?
Manella:
Oh, the boss over at the network, and some sponsors. Also a few production guys. They piled into a limousine and got here right around noon. Major tension! *sweats*
Phoenix:
Were all of them with you the entire time?
Manella:
Yeah, unfortunately. They're all gray-haired geezers... *scowl*

"'Samurai Summer' starring Jack Hammer." This poster's quite old.

This is where they had that meeting. There are documents and paper cups scattered around.




Trash can

Nothing in here that could be a clue. Just some paper cups and crumpled documents.

Its head fell over in the wind on the day of the murder. They didn't start moving the head out of the way until after 3:00. It was after 4:00 by the time the path was unblocked. Capice? Everyone in this trailer was stuck here until the path was cleared. Stuck in this trailer. Stuck until after 4:00. Hammer died at 2:30. Thus, none of us could have gone to Studio One.Maya:
W-what!?Vasquez:
It's true. A crane came just after 3:00 to move the head. We called some people in to clear the way. I'm sure they'd corroborate my story.Phoenix:

A s-samurai musical? Is that even a genre!? Well, I'm impressed. You know your stuff, Mia.
Mia:
Oh, Maya's the real fan. I just picked a little up.




Middle poster







Phoenix:
"'Samurai Summer' starring Jack Hammer." This poster looks like it's been hanging here for years.
Mia:
This is one of Maya's favorite movies.
Phoenix:
Maybe we should replace the poster in the office with this one?
Mia:
That... would be kind of sad.October 18Global StudiosEmployee AreaPhoenix:
Hey! Hey, you! W-wait a sec!Mia:

Yeah. His name's "Cody Hackins."Mia:
I think he ran into the dressing room.Examine









Bicycle







Phoenix:
Looks like one of those electric-powered bicycles. I dunno about these. I mean, what's the point?
Mia:
It makes it a lot easier to go up hills!
Phoenix:
Where have I heard that line before...?




Dressing room door







Phoenix:
The door to the dressing room. It's not locked.
Mia:
This is where Cody ran... Let's go in and see if we can get him to talk.




Storage room door







Phoenix:
That must be the storage room. That's where they keep all the film equipment.




Vending machine







Phoenix:
Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks, or something. Popcorn, at least!
Mia:
Look at this! "Spaghetti in a Soda Can"...?
Phoenix:
S-spaghetti? Wouldn't just the sauce come out and the noodles all stay stuck inside?
Mia:
"Best when slammed." I guess they want you to drink it in one gulp...?
Phoenix:
Slamming spaghetti. Right...October 18Global StudiosDressing RoomPhoenix:

Cosmetics







Phoenix:
There's an array of cosmetics here. According to Maya, that wig was used in some old TV show...
Cody:
You don't know "Samurai Boogey-Woogey"!? You're even lamer than I thought!
Phoenix:
(Why does everybody but me know about this show!?)




Powers's bag







Phoenix:
Mr. Powers's bag.
Mia:
Now, Phoenix, it's not polite to look through other people's belongings.
Phoenix:
H-hey, don't look at me! (Tell that to your sister!)




Table







Phoenix:
There's a box of snacks on the table, and some cans of soda. They're all empty. I'm glad Maya isn't here to see this. She'd be devastated.
Mia:
Sorry? What was that about Maya?
Phoenix:
O-oh, nothing.Talk









The Steel Samurai







Phoenix:
The Steel Samurai's so cool. I think he's the, um, the "bomb."
Cody:
Hah! What would a lamer like you know about the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
H-hey, watch that attitude!

Phoenix, you really should't yell like that. He's only a kid.
Cody:
Yeah! Don't yell like that I'm only a kid!




What happened

Powers's(?) Photo

Hey, it's the Steel Samurai. Huh? Why's he dragging his foot like that? Where'd you get this, anyway?




Samurai Spear

Steel Samurai Card







Phoenix:
Cody... This look familiar?
Cody:
Hey! My UR!
Phoenix:
"You are"... huh?
Cody:
"U.R." You know, "ultra rare"! That card's really hard to get! Man, for a grown-up, you sure are dumb!
Phoenix:
I'll give you this... IF you help me.
Cody:
But that's my card! By offering me something I already own, you're in effect eschewing the very basis of our consumer society, namely the principle of fair trade! Man, for a grown-up, you sure are dumb!
Phoenix:
(W-what do they teach these kids in school these days!? Quantum physics!?)
Cody:
Whatever, I don't need that card.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Cody:
I got a double. Just keep it. It's yours.
Phoenix:
(What!? After I went through all that trouble...)
Cody:
If you want to trade, find me a REALLY rare card!
Phoenix:
"Really rare"!? You mean there's something rarer than "Ultra Rare"!?
Cody:
Ultra Rare Premium cards are way rarer than plain Ultra Rare cards! Come ON! Man, for a grown-up, you sure are dumb!
Phoenix:
Premium... rare... why do I feel like we're talking about steaks?

The fanboy







Phoenix:
Have you seen that boy since then?
Penny:
Nope. You missed it, though. The security lady was chasing around after the boy so fast I thought she'd collapse. Of course, he got away in the end. Boy, was she mad!
Phoenix:
Actually, we saw them. How's the old windbag doing?
Penny:
She was squeezing donuts through her clenched fists back at the guard station.
Phoenix:

Mr. Hammer







Phoenix:
Are all the posters on the wall here of Hammer?
Penny:
Yes. It's really a terrible loss for the studios.
Phoenix:
But... his popularity had been waning recently, right?

That's true. Then again, after what happened...

No, what?

The Steel Samurai







Phoenix:
So... you like the Steel Samurai.
Cody:
He's so cool!
Phoenix:
I... I guess.
Cody:
You're judging him by his looks! You have to look at his actions, at his life!
Phoenix:
(I'm being lectured on life by a grade schooler...)
Cody:
You like him too, don'tcha?
Phoenix:
Uh... Oh, me? Y-yeah! I, um, love the Steel Samurai.

So, tell me what your favorite thing about the Steel Samurai is!

Whoa! That's totally hard-core!

So, what else do you like about him?
Phoenix:

Yeah! Whizzam! The Steel Samurai always wins! Always! Check this out! It's my fan album!
Phoenix:
What the...? It's all pictures of the Steel Samurai.
Cody:
I go to every live performance!

I always take a picture when the Steel Samurai lands the final blow! Whizzam! I got 'em all! I never missed one! A perfect collection! Check it out! My new digital camera!
Mia:
Wow, that's very impressive. The newest model, isn't it?

Yeah...

Did you see anything unusual?

Thanks for this.

Hey, I gave that to the nice lady, not you, loser! No looking at that, okay!
Phoenix:
(Believe me, I wasn't going to...)Phoenix:
Cody... I need to ask you something very important. What did you see on the day of the incident?Cody:
... I got here that day around 2:00... I had to come in through the woods out back so that old lady wouldn't see me. I got kinda lost, though. I was in there for maybe a half hour or so. Then I finally got to the studio. After that...Mia:
What is it, Cody?Cody:
Th-the Steel Samurai killed the bad guy! He used his Samurai Spear! Just like always! One shot, one kill! It happened so fast... I got scared. I went home after that.Phoenix:
I... I see. It must have been hard for you.Cody:
Man, you say those nice things but it's so obvious you aren't speaking from the heart.Phoenix:
(Umm... right.) Mia?Mia:
Yes?Phoenix:
I think we can say for sure this means the Steel Samurai did it.Mia:
True enough.Phoenix:
And the director has an alibi, so it wasn't him.Mia:
Indeed.Phoenix:
So... the only person left who it could have been is Will Powers!Mia:
... I have to admit, it's kind of a shock. But if you put this boy on the witness stand, your client will be "guilty" for sure.Phoenix:
Let's not call him then...Mia:
I think that would be wise. Best to leave this one alone.???:
Not so fast, pal!Gumshoe:
I heard everything! This boy here's a key witness! And he's under police protection, starting now! C'mon, son. You've got a rendezvous with me down at the precinct!Cody:
No! I ain't going! Waah!Mia:
... That didn't go so well. We're back to zero leads. And now we have a serious handicap in court.Phoenix:
W-what're we going to do, Mia!Mia:
Well, hmm... I... really need to be going. Don't worry, Phoenix. I'm sure you'll be fine!Phoenix:

Yes?Will:
Why do you look so... unhappy?Phoenix:
O-oh! Oh, nothing! Eh heh heh. Really, it's nothing. Right, Mia? (Uh oh. She looks even unhappier...)Mia:
Phoenix. Your client is now practically a dead man walking... Perhaps that's why I feel particularly close to him.Phoenix:
This is no time for dead-people jokes, please.Mia:
You know we're going into this trial utterly defenseless. Yet, if Mr. Powers is truly innocent... We should be able to find something overlooked in the evidence to prove it.Phoenix:
Something "overlooked"...?Mia:
We have to find something, Phoenix, today. It's that, or lose the trial.Phoenix:
(This isn't going to be easy.)October 19, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:
Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth:
An unexpected fact has come to the attention of the court. Yesterday, we learned that there were other people present at the studios. Today, I would like to show evidence proving they had nothing to do with the murder.Judge:
Very well. You may call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth.Phoenix:
(I wonder if it'll be that producer...) (Changed from [I wonder if that producer is going to come out...] in the original release)Edgeworth:
The prosecution calls Mr. Sal Manella to the stand.Phoenix:
(...or that director.)Edgeworth:
Will the witness state his name and profession?Manella:
... How r00d can j00 get! J00 don't know ME!? I'm the director! I make the Steel Samurai, n00b! ROFL!Edgeworth:
...Manella:
S... Sal Manella. I'm a director. Television.Judge:
Were you at Global Studios on the day of the murder?Manella:
Y-yes, Your Honor.Judge:
Hmm... Very well. Please testify to the court about the events of that day.Mia:
Phoenix. Let's start by picking this testimony apart. If Powers is innocent, you know what that means. Someone in the trailer on that day did it!Phoenix:
R-right. (She doesn't waste any time putting on the pressure!)Witness Testimony-- The Day of the Murder --Manella:
I was at the studios from around 9:00 that morning.
During the morning, I was doing... umm... an action scene run-through.
It took a lot more time than I thought it would.
I hear that everyone else ate lunch in the Employee Area...
But I had a meeting in the Studio Two trailer, so I ended up skipping lunch.
We were in the meeting until around 4:00...
During the meeting, well, I'm pretty sure no one left their chairs.
That's about it.Judge:
Hmm... The time of Mr. Hammer's death was 2:30 PM. And according to your testimony, you were in a meeting at that time. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.Cross Examination-- The Day of the Murder --Manella:
I was at the studios from around 9:00 that morning.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Is that when you always come in to work?
Manella:
Oh, oh no. I come in all sort of hours. It's the "industry" way.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, I know all about the freaks in your "industry"...)
Manella:
Still, FWIW, I was pretty busy all that day. :(
Edgeworth:
Tell us more about that.Manella:
During the morning, I was doing... umm... an action scene run-through.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
In the Employee Area?
Manella:
That's right. It was a fight scene between the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate.
Phoenix:
Was anyone else at the run-through?
Manella:
Oh, yeah. That security lady was sitting there watching the whole thing. LOL. She was cheering on Hammer, if you can believe it.
Phoenix:
(She certainly has the lungs for it...) Anyone else?
Manella:
Nope, just us four.Manella:
It took a lot more time than I thought it would.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Why did it go on so long?
Manella:
Um, I'm pretty sure j00've already heard about this... But WP twisted his ankle during the run-through, see...
Phoenix:
(Oh, right, thus the limp.)
Manella:
Which of course led to me missing my lunch. ROFS!
Phoenix:
(ROFS? Rolling on the Floor... Starving?)Manella:
I hear that everyone else ate lunch in the Employee Area...Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What exactly did they have for lunch?
Manella:
T-bone steak! The assistant cooked some up.
Phoenix:
(Come to think of it, there was a plate with some bones on it in the Employee Area.)
Edgeworth:
"Everyone else" meaning that the witness did not eat with them.Manella:
But I had a meeting in the Studio Two trailer, so I ended up skipping lunch.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So, in the end, you didn't get to eat?
Manella:
Yeah. No steak, at least! Can j00 believe it?
Phoenix:
That must have been tough.
Mia:
Phoenix.
Phoenix:
Yeah?
Mia:
Doesn't something about that seem odd to you?



Not at all







Phoenix:
Well, no, not really. Seems pretty straightforward.
Mia:
Oh. Perhaps I was wrong, then.
Leads back to cross-examination




It's a little vague







Phoenix:
Actually, there is something bothering me. Mr. Manella, just now you said "steak, at least." So you ate something other than steak?
Manella:
Yeah, good call! I had some chocolate in my pocket, which I used to stave off starvation!
Phoenix:
I see... (Is that all? I was sure I was on to something there.)
Leads back to cross-examination




It's contradictory







Phoenix:
Yeah, it does seem odd, now that you mention it. Mr. Manella!
Manella:
H-hmm? W-what do j00 mean? *sweats*
Phoenix:
When I went to Studio Two, I saw something on the table there. (Changed from [When I went to that trailer, I saw something on the table.] in the original release) There were two plates--the same kind of plates as the ones in the Employee Area. (Changed from [There were two plates on the table--the same kind of plates as in the Employee Area.] in the original release) Who ate lunch there?
Manella:
M-mmpf! No, er, ah, um, eh heh. Good call! *sweats* I, er, I was embarrassed so I didn't mention it... But I did eat, after all.
Phoenix:
A t-bone steak, you mean?
Manella:
Yeah, well, I mean the assistant went through all that trouble... I brought it to the trailer thinking I could eat it later.
Phoenix:
(Clearly a man who likes to eat. I'd suspected as much...) So, when exactly did you eat it?
Manella:
We took one break during that meeting. I, er, wolfed it down then. *drool*
Phoenix:
(A mental image I will carry with me to my grave... Wait a second...! If they took a break in that meeting, that contradicts his testimony! I'll press on that one a bit more...)
Leads back to cross-examinationManella:
We were in the meeting until around 4:00...Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What were you discussing?
Manella:
The Steel Samurai story, and our budget. Get this! The sponsors turn to me and say, "Mr. Manella. Those scripts of yours are not appropriate for children." Can j00 believe it!?
Phoenix:
(Actually, I kind of can.) So, nobody left the table during the whole meeting?Manella:
During the meeting, well, I'm pretty sure no one left their chairs.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
You didn't take a single break?
Manella:
Er... well... Y-yeah! Not a one! *sweats*

Press harder







Leads to:
"Wait a second!"




Leave him be







Phoenix:
(No, on second thought, I'm drawing a blank. If I press too hard in the wrong place, I'll just end up scaring him into silence. Maybe I'll just sit back and see what happens.)
Leads back to cross-examinationMia:
Phoenix. If his alibi holds, Powers is finished. Press him as hard as you can and find out where he's lying!Phoenix:
R-right!Phoenix:
Wait a second! Mr. Manella, you've just contradicted yourself! Didn't you just tell the court that you ate that t-bone steak during a break?Manella:
Oops! ROFL!Phoenix:
Well?Manella:
Umm...Judge:
Mr. Manella, what's this all about?Manella:
W-well, yeah, I guess we did take a little break.Mia:
Phoenix! Great job! If they took a break, one of them could have gone to the studio during that time!Phoenix:
Your Honor! I call on the witness to testify to the court about this break!Judge:
Very well. Mr. Manella, your testimony, please.Manella:
Urk!Edgeworth:
Heh heh heh...Phoenix:
(Uh oh. Edgeworth is laughing...)Witness Testimony-- The Break --Manella:
Yeah, FWIW, we took a break... ROFL!
But it was only 15 minutes! 15! That's only 13 in Base 12!
Not enough time for someone to, say, commit murder in Studio One! LOL!
That's only just enough time to eat a t-bone steak, if you ask me! *steams*Judge:
Hmm... I don't think it would even be enough time for that, but that's just me. Very well. You may begin the cross-examination.Cross Examination-- The Break --Manella:
Yeah, FWIW, we took a break... ROFL!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What time exactly did you take this break?
Manella:
Hmm... I'd say it was from around 2:30 or so until 2:45.
Phoenix:
(2:30!!! That's the time of death! So he could have gone to Studio One, killed Hammer, and come back... I guess it's possible, time-wise...)
Edgeworth:

But it was only 15 minutes! 15! That's only 13 in Base 12!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What were you doing for those 15 minutes?
Manella:
Eating my t-bone steak! What else!?
Phoenix:
There were two plates on the trailer table...?
Manella:
Oh, right. The other one was Diva's... sorry, Dee Vasquez's plate.
Phoenix:
(Dee Vasquez... the producer.)
Edgeworth:
To eat a t-bone steak in 15 minutes... that's quite a feat.Manella:

Why is that?Press (after pressing first statement)

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
I have to say, you look like a guy who gets through his meals pretty fast.
Manella:
Well, I was facing a cold, slightly chewy t-bone steak... Even I have to take my time eating that kind of food. LOLMia:
Well, Phoenix?Phoenix:
That testimony was too short to wring any kind of useful information out of!Mia:
All you have to do is prove that he was able to go to Studio One in that time!Phoenix:
(Oh, great. Is that all...)Phoenix:
Why is that?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
Haven't we had enough of this pointless line of questioning? Your Honor! The testimony to this point has made one certain fact painfully clear: The people in the trailer had nothing to do with this murder! It was impossible for any of them to go to Studio One!Phoenix:
What!?Edgeworth:
Something wrong, Mr. Wright? Surely you aren't suggesting one of the people in the trailer went to Studio One!Judge:
Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright?Mia:
Phoenix, this is critical! Think about it before you give your answer!Judge:
Do you claim someone from the trailer went to Studio One?I claim it, and claim it loud







Phoenix:
(If I agree to let everyone in that trailer off the hook then the trial is over... Mr. Powers will be found guilty for sure!) The victim was murdered at 2:30, the exact time of the break in the meeting. With 15 minutes, murder is certainly a possibility!
Judge:
Hmm... I suppose you might say that...
Phoenix:
(Alright, I've got the judge thinking now!)
Edgeworth:
Tsk, tsk, tsk... Never a dull moment with you, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
What's your point, Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
You've been doing your homework, haven't you? Look at the Court Record.
Phoenix:
The Court Record...?
Edgeworth:
Surely, you knew that from 2:15 to 4:00 the path between the studios was blocked? Mrs. Monkey's head had fallen across the path!
Phoenix:
Whoa! You're right!
Edgeworth:
True, the break in the trailer meeting came right at the time of death... However! The path from there to the scene of the crime was blocked! The fallen Mrs. Monkey head barred the way!
Phoenix:
... (It's actually "Mr. Monkey," but Edgeworth has a point... And somehow, I feel no desire to correct him.)
Judge:
No counter-argument, Mr. Wright? Then I'm afraid you lose this round.
Leads to:
"I believe we have seen enough evidence."No, it's impossible.







Phoenix:
(I don't want to write off so many possible suspects... But I can't keep claiming the impossible, either...) I agree that it was impossible for anyone in the trailer to go to the studio in that time.
Edgeworth:
Ha hah! I thought you might be thoughtlessly treading on thin ice again! But I see you had at least an inkling of the truth.
Judge:
What do you mean, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
It's quite simple... True, the break in the trailer meeting came right at the time of death... However! The path from there to the scene of the crime was blocked! The fallen Mrs. Monkey head barred the way! At around 2:15, a strong gust of wind knocked off the studio mascot's head. Ergo! When the people in the trailer took a break at 2:30, the way to the studio was blocked. Blocked... by Mrs. Monkey's severed head!
Phoenix:
... (It's actually "Mr. Monkey," but Edgeworth has a point... And somehow, I feel no desire to correct him.)
Leads to:
"I believe we have seen enough evidence."Edgeworth:
I believe we have seen enough evidence. I would like to relieve Mr. Manella from the stand.Phoenix:
(Wh-what? It's over?)Judge:
Very well. The court's opinion on this case is as follows: We have found that there were several other people in Studio 2 on the day of the murder. However, it is also clear that none of these people could have gone to Studio One. They therefore have no relation to this case. Furthermore, with regards to the photo of the Steel Samurai... Given the size of the costume, no one other than Mr. Powers could have worn it that day. All that is lacking is decisive evidence that he is the one who did it. If we had that, I'm afraid I would have to find Mr. Powers guilty.Edgeworth:
Your Honor. The prosecution is pleased to announce that we indeed have decisive evidence: a witness.Judge:
Who is this witness, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:
My witness saw the very moment when the Steel Samurai skewered the victim!Judge:
Order! I will have order! I see. The court will take a 10 minute recess, after which we will hear your witness. Court is adjourned for recess!October 19, 11:04 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Mia:
...Phoenix:
What do we do now, Mia? If everyone in that trailer has an alibi...Mia:
... I'm sorry, Phoenix. I guess I was wrong.Phoenix:
M-Mia! Don't tell me you're giving up! If you give up, what hope do I have...?Mia:
... Don't get me wrong. I've never given up on a trial before, not while there was a chance. Only one thing became clear in your cross-examination. The people in the trailer could not have gone to Studio One. I thought there was more to it than that... But I was wrong. That's all there is.Will:
Umm... Er... What's going to happen to me? It kinda seems like everyone in that courtroom thinks I did it... They think I'm a murderer!Mia:
Don't worry, Mr. Powers. If you are innocent, we will prove it. I guarantee it. Leave it to us, and... be yourself. Be strong. You are the Steel Samurai, hero to children everywhere, after all.Will:
I... You... Thanks. *sniff*Mia:
Okay, Phoenix. This one's for the kids! Let's do it!October 19, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:
Court is back in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:
The prosecution has a concern. As our witness is a grade schooler of tender years, and this is a murder case... we worry that the defense might cause unnecessary trauma with his cruel questioning. (Changed from [We worry that the defense might cause unnecessary trauma with his cruel questioning!] in the original release)Phoenix:
(Nice to see Edgeworth taking the moral high ground...)Edgeworth:
However, we have no choice. The prosecution calls Cody Hackins to the stand.Edgeworth:
Your Honor. Perhaps you could arrange a box for him to stand on?Judge:
Oh, r-right. Guard, please bring him a box. One of those donut crates should do.Edgeworth:
Will the witness state his name and grade in school.Cody:
...Edgeworth:
Witness!Cody:
What!? Just 'cause you're all grown-up don't mean you can push me around!Edgeworth:
Mrph...Mia:
Cody? Answer his question, okay?Cody:
H-hey, it's you! The nice lady! I'm Cody Hackins. I'm in 2nd grade!Phoenix:
(I get the feeling this is going to be a long, long day...)Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth. Please remember that you're speaking to a child. Try to be gentle.Edgeworth:
M-mrrrrph! Witness! Er, I mean, Cody.Phoenix:
(He's having trouble with this "gentle" thing.)Edgeworth:
You were present, er, you were at Global Studios on the day of the, er, incident?Cody:
You got a problem with that!?Edgeworth:
Please tell us what you saw that day.Cody:
What, pops? You want me to tell you and gramps with the beard over there?Edgeworth:
Just.. Mr. Edgeworth will be fine.Judge:
I prefer "bearded gentleman" myself.Phoenix:
(A very long day...)Judge:
Incidentally, photographic equipment is strictly forbidden in this courtroom.Edgeworth:
M-mpht! M-my apologies, Your Honor. He said he wouldn't testify if he couldn't bring it... I'd like special permission, if that's possible.Phoenix:
Wait, so you're saying you had to bargain terms with a kid... and you LOST?Cody:
Hey! I just got this new camera! Don't really know how to use it all that good yet! But I bring it with me wherever I go!Mia:
Phoenix. I wonder if he had that camera on the day of the murder... You'd better make a note of it in the Court Record.Cody's Camera added to the Court Record.Judge:
Very well, Cody. Please testify to the court about what you saw the day of the incident.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Cody:
I wanted to see a Steel Samurai rehearsal, just once.
I found a map on the Internet, and went to the studios that day.
I went through the woods off the path, so that old lady wouldn't catch me.
I was going for the studio.
I got kinda lost on the way, though. For about 30 minutes.
When I came out by the studio, there was the Steel Samurai!
It totally rocked! Right before my eyes, out came the bad guy!
Of course, the Steel Samurai took him down! Pow!
If I had my camera with me, that woulda been the time for a shot, I tell you.
Anyway, I couldn't get into the studio, so I went home.Judge:
Hmm... Very well. The defense may begin its cross-examination. But be gentle. Remember you're talking to a child. (Changed from [And, be gentle. Remember you're talking to a child.] in the original release)Cody:
...Phoenix:
(This kid is tougher than most adults we see in here, honestly...)Cross Examination

2025-01-22 14:44:30,169 - INFO - Assistant reply: To find the contradiction in Cody's testimony, let's analyze his statements and compare them with the evidence we have.

1. Cody states that he found a map on the Internet and visited the studios (Testimony 1).
2. He mentions he went through the woods to avoid the security lady (Testimony 2).
3. He was going to the studio but got lost for about 30 minutes (Testimony 4).
4. Cody saw the Steel Samurai and a fight where the Steel Samurai took down the bad guy (Testimony 6-7).
5. He regrets not having his camera with him at the time (Testimony 8).

The key statement to focus on is his regret about not having the camera with him during the fight (Testimony 8). Cody says, "If I had my camera with me, that woulda been the time for a shot, I tell you." However, we know Cody always carries his camera, as evidenced by:

- "Cody's Camera" (Evidence 15): "A new digital camera. Cody always carries it, though he's still learning how to use it."

This contradiction shows Cody likely had his camera during the incident, contradicting his claim of not having it. This implies he might have photographic evidence of what happened and could be withholding important information.

Our school had a saying: \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\" In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one.

Now for the morning news. The actor Will Powers was arrested yesterday. Powers plays the lead role in the popular kid's show "The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo." He was arrested on suspicion of murder. The victim was Jack Hammer, who plays the villain known as the "Evil Magistrate." His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. The "Samurai Spear" was also found stuck through the body. Police believe this was the murder weapon, and are investigating further.Phoenix:

Bookshelf







Phoenix:
There's a horrendous amount of legal books here. Scarier still is the thought that I have to read all of these now.




Houseplant







Phoenix:
Mia's favorite potted plant. Maya has been watering it so much lately it looks a little... swollen. She's either trying to make it grow... or she's perfecting her water torture technique.




Movie poster







Phoenix:
A poster of an old movie that Mia liked. I was thinking I should go see it myself. Then I realized that the poster doesn't actually say the title of the movie.




Desk







Phoenix:
Mia's desk. Actually... it's my desk now. Sitting here always makes me feel like a professional.




Window







Phoenix:
It's a nice day outside. The hotel across the way is always full these days. There's the bellboy, happily cleaning the room.Talk









What to do







Phoenix:
Well, what should we do?
Maya:
What should we do!? How can you just sit there like that!? We have to get down to the detention center and meet the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
(Does she want to investigate this case or just do some sightseeing, I wonder? My money's on sightseeing.)




Any ideas







Maya:
We don't have enough information to make a case yet.

No! We just don't have enough information!Present

Security guard







Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He seems frozen in awe of Will Powers.Talk









What happened







Phoenix:
Maybe you could start by telling us what happened.
Will:
Y-yes. Of course. It seems like it was only yesterday. Actually, it was only yesterday. The cast had come down to Global Studios for a run-through. We went through a few action sequences at 10:00 that morning. There was a rehearsal scheduled for 5:00 in the afternoon. But when 5:00 came around, and the staff gathered at the studio... The Evil Magistrate was found lying in a crumpled heap near the set. They took off his mask... And discovered that it was Jack Hammer... dead! He had been expertly skewered with the Samurai Spear.
Phoenix:
The "Samurai Spear"...?
Will:
Yes, it's a long spear that I... that the Steel Samurai uses as a weapon.




The Steel Samurai







Phoenix:
Maybe you could explain to me just what "the Steel Samurai" is.
Maya:
Nick! How could you say such a thing? I-I'm sorry, sir, I apologize for my partner! He's new to this, and a bit OUT OF TOUCH with the world.
Phoenix:
Hey! Who's "new to this"!?
Will:
No, it's alright, really. The Steel Samurai is the lead character in a popular kid's show. He walks the streets of Neo Olde Tokyo... Fighting battle after battle against the Evil Magistrate and his minions. Of course, he never really defeats the Evil Magistrate. Although... I guess he did defeat him this time... *sniff* Uwaaah!
Phoenix:
I-I see. (Neo Olde Tokyo...? Who comes up with these names!?)




Powers's alibi (appears after "What happened")







Phoenix:
Now, where were you on the day of the murder?
Will:
Well, that morning I came to studios at 9:00. We worked through some action scenes until noon. Rehearsal was to begin at 5:00, but I was a little tired. So after lunch, I took a nap in my dressing room. When I woke up, it was after 5:00! I was late for the rehearsal! I hurried to the studio... and found everyone looking shocked. They arrested me on the spot, and brought me here.
Phoenix:
(So he was sleeping the entire afternoon of the murder? Some action hero!)
Will:
What will the kids think? *sniff*Present

Wasting your time at a place like this. Don't you have jobs you should be doing? Or do lawyers not work like the rest of us? Maybe I should become a lawyer too. Sounds like a life of ease to me no work just loafing around all day as you please. Well when I was young things were a mite different, mind you we didn't prance around in strange hippie clothes.

Computer







Phoenix:
The computer that runs the studio security cameras.
Oldbag:
Hey! No touching!




Guard station







Phoenix:
The security guard station. That security lady must like junk food. There's a mountain of it on the desk in there. I can see the computer that runs the security cameras.




Main gate







Phoenix:
The main entrance to the studio. There was a big scene here yesterday with onlookers pressing up against the gate.




Studio map







Phoenix:
An overhead map of the studios. Right from here is the Employee Area. To the left are the actual film studios.




Studio van







Phoenix:
Looks like a studio van. They probably use it to carry around film equipment.Talk









The studios







Phoenix:
So, what do you do here at the studios?
Oldbag:
At Global Studios, we make children's dreams come true! In fact, in my younger days...
Maya:
No! You were a star!?
Oldbag:
Only a little twinkle between the stars here, I'm afraid, dearie.
Maya:
Wo... wow.
Oldbag:
This place has really gone downhill, you know? But 10 years ago, now that was a studio of dreams! Hammer was a big star back then too, he was...
Phoenix:
Hammer...?
Oldbag:
The victim, dummy! The Evil Magistrate! He's been reduced to playing villains now. Not exactly the best material to work with...




Will Powers







Phoenix:
Can you tell me about Mr. Will Powers?
Oldbag:
He's not a bad kid, but don't be fooled by his mask! You wouldn't want him on the silver screen without it, believe me. Little old ladies watching would lose their lunch! That's probably why he thought that the Steel Samurai was his "big chance." No one thought he was capable of doing what he did to poor Jack Hammer...
Maya:
We don't know for certain that Will Powers is guilty!
Oldbag:
Powers? Of course he's guilty! How do I know? I know everything! That's my job.




Mr. Hammer (appears after "The studios")







Phoenix:
What kind of person was Jack Hammer?
Oldbag:
What "kind of person"? Oh... if you only knew! Jack Hammer will live on in many hearts as the ultimate action hero! He was simply dashing in the Dynamite Samurai series!
Phoenix:
(Should I have heard of that...?)
Oldbag:
But... there was an accident during filming five years ago. He got an unlucky break after that. Reduced to playing the villain on a children's program! What's more, I heard they were paying him peanuts. It's enough to make you cry.




Reason for suspicion (appears after "Will Powers")







Phoenix:
Why are you so certain Mr. Powers is the killer?
Oldbag:
I was standing right here yesterday, I was. I was here from 1:00 in the afternoon, to 5:00, when they found the body! Now the studio where the murder took place is to the left here. So if you want to go to the studio, you have to pass by me! Only one person went by here between 1:00 and 2:30, when the murder took place!
Phoenix:
And... that person was Mr. Powers?
Oldbag:
Yes. I saw him!
Phoenix:
But Mr. Powers says he was sleeping in his dressing room.
Oldbag:
Oh, I'm sure he would say that. He's no fool! But he was the only one that walked by. He's the killer, you can bet your biscuits on it.Present

Your alibi







Phoenix:
Mr. Powers, you aren't hiding anything from me, are you?
Will:
W-what? No! I'd never do that!
Phoenix:
Just now you said that you were sleeping in your dressing room after lunch.
Will:
Yes. Like a baby.
Phoenix:
But the security lady said she saw you that day. She says she saw you heading towards the scene of the crime!
Will:
W-what!? That's not possible! I... I really don't know what to say! I was sleeping, I promise!
Phoenix:
Mr. Powers, if you want me to help you, you have to tell me the truth. I'm new to this lawyer business, and I need every advantage I can get.
Will:
I know... I-I'm sorry. *sniff* But, I swear to you on my momma's grave, I was sleeping. Maybe the security lady only thought she saw me?
Phoenix:
(What did she see...? He doesn't seem to be lying.)




The security lady







Phoenix:
Umm... about the security guard at the main gate to the studio...
Will:
Oh, the security lady?
Maya:
She's terrible! She called me "suspicious lookin'"!
Will:
Y-yes... actually, she's said the same thing to me before. "Take off that mask!" were her words, I believe. She sucks up to all the bigwigs at the studio... But let her see you stumble once and she'll never let up on you.
Maya:
Grr! She's got some nerve!
Phoenix:
Do you think you could write up a letter formally requesting my representation?
Will:

Maya:
What's up with that thing!? It looks kind of... busted.
Gumshoe:
Oh, the wind was pretty strong yesterday, and the head broke off. It took that tree down with it, too.




Security camera







Phoenix:
Hey, there's a camera here.
Gumshoe:
That's the security camera. It takes photos of people going to the studio. All you have to do is look at the data and you can see who went where!
Phoenix:
There's a number plate on the camera... [ST1-307]. That must be the camera ID number.




Studio One entrance







Phoenix:
The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.
Maya:
Let's go in and check it out, Nick! ... Hey! It's locked!
Phoenix:
Looks like you need a cardkey to get in. It makes sense that they would want to keep the non-employees out.




Welcome sign







Maya:
There's a big welcome sign above the path.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, apparently the studio's fallen on tough times. They've started letting people in on days they aren't filming. They make a bit of extra money by charging for admission.
Maya:
Huh. You sure know a lot about this place, Detective. You know, you could always quit being a detective and work here?
Phoenix:
Yeah! And what perfect timing, with the monkey's neck broken and all.
Gumshoe:
Huh? Just what's that supposed to mean, pal!?Talk









The investigation







Phoenix:
So, how is your investigation going, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Well, it's... Hey! I can't tell you that, pal.
Maya:
Nick... Maybe you need to be a little more indirect with your questions?
Phoenix:
Right. So, Detective, mind if I take a look at what you got?
Gumshoe:
What I got?
Phoenix:
The autopsy report! The latest version, if you please...
Gumshoe:
Hmm... right, right. Sorry about what happened last time, pal.
Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.




The investigation (subsequent times)







Phoenix:
So, how is your investigation going, Detective?
Gumshoe:
I'm not at liberty to give you any more information, pal. You'll hear all you need to know in court!
Phoenix:
(Oh well, it was worth a try.)




Reason for arrest







Phoenix:
Why was Mr. Powers arrested?
Gumshoe:
Simple, pal! The murder took place right over there in Studio One. Now, the victim entered Studio One at approximately 1:00 PM. At that time, there was no one other than the victim in the studio. According to the autopsy report, the time of death was 2:30 PM. Only one person went to the studio between 1:00 and 2:30! And that person was none other than Will Powers! No one else, pal! If you think I'm lying, ask the security lady at the main gate.
Maya:
Nick! If that's true...! Anyone would think that Powers did it with that kind of evidence!
Phoenix:
Thanks for cheering me up...




The security lady







Phoenix:
About the security lady...
Gumshoe:
Oh, that sweet old lady. What a charmer!
Phoenix:
Huh? A-are we talking about the same person?
Gumshoe:
When I showed her my badge she gave me a donut and some coffee!
Maya:
Remember what Powers said. She's a sucker for authority.
Gumshoe:
She even gave me a piece of valuable evidence!
Maya:
Whaat!?




Decisive evidence (appears after "The security lady")







Phoenix:
What kind of evidence!?
Gumshoe:
Well, that, er, photo. The photo of the Steel Samurai heading toward the scene of the crime!
Maya:
What! Who took that!?
Gumshoe:
See the camera up on that gate, pal?
Maya:
The gate? You mean the one with the welcome sign?
Gumshoe:
Yeah. Whenever someone walks by, that camera automatically snaps a photo of them!
Maya:
Oh no! Nick, he has evidence! We're finished!
Phoenix:
(Funny, for someone with hard proof he doesn't look too happy.)
Gumshoe:
...Present









Attorney's Badge







Phoenix:
Detective, see this? This is my attorney's badge.
Gumshoe:
Uh huh? Don'tcha think it's a little sad when you have to explain what your badge means, pal? Real men show their P.D. badge and that's that!
Phoenix:
I'll admit the design of my badge leaves a lot to be desired...
Maya:
Maybe it should just be a big "L" for "Lawyer"?
Phoenix:
Hmm... I'm not so sure about that.




Anything else







Phoenix:
Um, Detective. Any ideas about this?
Gumshoe:
Look, I don't got time to look at every little trinket you got, okay pal?After clearing "The investigation" and "Decisive evidence" Talk options:Gumshoe:
What's wrong, pal? You seem down.Phoenix:
Don't look so happy when you say that.Gumshoe:
Oh hoh hoh hoh hoh!Maya:
Umm... We'd like to ask the employees here some questions...Gumshoe:
Sure thing, pal. Go wherever you like. Of course, you're not going to find any clues I haven't already found! Hah hah hah!Phoenix:
(I'm glad someone around here seems to be enjoying themselves.)Maya:
Nick, let's go! We've got a free pass to the place. Now's our chance to check things out!Studio - Main GateMaya:
Nick! Look! That security lady is in the guard station stuffing her face with donuts! I guess all cops like their donuts!Phoenix:
Yeah, and they're soft enough she doesn't need teeth to chew them...Oldbag:
Hey, you! Well? Are you satisfied Powers is guilty yet?Phoenix:
(Urk! She had to make my life harder by giving that photo to Detective Gumshoe...)Talk









Photographic proof







Phoenix:
Why didn't you tell us about the security photo, ma'am?
Oldbag:
Hmm? Oh, that? I just thought it would be more thrilling to talk with the detective himself! These things are important, you know. Oh, just to the left from here is the gate with the camera that took that photo. It's my job to check the photos every day, you see.




Reason for suspicion







Oldbag:
This guard station is in a central position. No matter where you go here, you pass by my station first! Now poor Hammer, he went to the studio just before 1:00. The murder happened right around 2:30, see? The only one I seen go through here between 1:00 and 2:30 was Powers himself! The security camera got a good look at him too. If he's not the one what did it, I don't know who is!
Phoenix:
Maybe... it was you?
Oldbag:
Gyah hah ha hah! Good one, sonny.
Phoenix:
(She thinks I was joking.)




Mr. Hammer







Phoenix:
Was the victim, Mr. Hammer, a popular actor?
Oldbag:
Oh, he was the biggest star in the studio!
Phoenix:
("Was"? Past tense?)
Maya:
Oh yes! He was great as the "Bearded Samurai"!
Oldbag:
That too, yes. He shone the brightest! Back in the day. Making a star like him play the "Evil Magistrate"... It's a disgrace, I tell you! Hammer took it pretty hard, and who can blame him?




Automatic camera (appears after "Photographic proof")







Phoenix:
About the security camera...
Oldbag:
Oh yes, the camera. It's automatic. It can tell when someone walks through that gate, see? Then it snaps a photo! Apparently, it records the time when it takes a picture too. But I don't bother myself with those details. I just view all the photos on the computer over in the security guard station. I check 'em every day before going home, I do.October 16Wright & Co. Law OfficesMaya:
What's going on, Nick!? Powers said he was sleeping in his dressing room! But now there's a photo of him going to the studio!?Phoenix:
Don't look at me! How should I know?Talk









What to do







Phoenix:
What do you think?
Maya:
That photo the detective was talking about is the problem here.
Phoenix:
Well, that's hard to say, without seeing the actual photo ourselves. But if it is Powers in that photo, his alibi is shot.




Photographic proof







Phoenix:
Only one person went to the scene of the crime before the murder took place. And there's a photograph to prove it.
Maya:
I guess it makes sense that that person is the killer then. What do we do, Nick?
Phoenix:
Maybe there was someone else who could have gone to the scene other than Powers? Let's take a look. Maybe that security lady missed someone?
Maya:
On thing's for sure, if there are any clues, they'll be in that studio.October 16Detention CenterVisitor's RoomPhoenix:
...Maya:
Apparently they have Mr. Powers in questioning.Phoenix:
Hmm... right.Gumshoe:
Look pal, that camera takes a picture automatically whenever someone walks by. And it took a picture of Will Powers!Phoenix:
I have to ask him about that photograph!Maya:
Oh well. Let's try again later.Examine









Security guard







Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He must get pretty bored. I bet he's making funny faces at that camera.October 16Global StudiosEmployee AreaMaya:
Nick! This is where they do all the behind-the-scenes stuff! Hey! Look! There's Powers's dressing room! No one's here this soon after the murder I guess. Let's take a look around!Examine









Bicycle







Phoenix:
Looks like one of those electric-powered bicycles. I dunno about these. I mean, what's the point?
Maya:
It makes it a lot easier to go up hills!
Phoenix:
Don't people cycle to get exercise!?




Drain grate







Phoenix:
The metal grate on the drain here has been taken off. That's a pretty big drain. A kid could fit through there, I bet.
Maya:
Yeah, if you snuck in that way you wouldn't have to pay at the gate!
Phoenix:
Well, if you want to leave that way, be my guest.
Maya:
Right! Huh? Hey! I'm not a kid!




Grate







Phoenix:
The grate that used to cover the drain. It's a little bent. I don't think it would fit if I tried to put it back on.




Lunch table







Phoenix:
The remains of yesterday's lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak.
Maya:
Mmm! T-bone steak! That would have hit the spot.
Phoenix:
You just had a burger!
Maya:
Yeah, but I have a second stomach just for steaks.
Phoenix:
(What!?)




Stage backdrop







Phoenix:
There's a half-finished backdrop for a stage here. Looks like a castle. Probably "Neo Olde Tokyo Castle."




Dressing room door







Phoenix:
The door to the dressing room. It's not locked.
Maya:
Hey, Nick! Let's take a look inside! Maybe we can find something as a souvenir...?
Phoenix:
What do you mean "find"!?
Maya:
You never know! There might be something like... the Samurai Spear!
Phoenix:
We don't need a spear! (And that's the murder weapon for crying out loud!)




Dressing room sign







Phoenix:
There's a sign on the dressing room door. "Mr. Will Powers"... it must be neat to be the star and have your own room like this.




Dressing room window







Phoenix:
A window into the dressing room. The glass is frosted, so I can't see inside.




Storage room door







Phoenix:
That must be the storage room. That's where they keep all the film equipment.
Maya:
Wow, Nick! You know a lot about the industry!
Phoenix:
Umm, what else would they keep in a film studio?




Vending machine







Phoenix:
Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks or something. Popcorn, at least!
Maya:
W-wait! Look! "Samurai Soda"! Nick! Try this!
Phoenix:

(Powers's dressing room... So this is where he was sleeping? Or at least, this is where he claims he was sleeping.)Maya:
No one actually saw him taking a nap here, did they?Phoenix:
Right, and there's a picture of him near the crime scene. (I hope he's telling the truth... for his sake!)Examine









Cosmetics







Phoenix:
There's a vast array of cosmetics here.
Maya:
Ooh! This is the wig he used in "Samurai Boogey-Woogey"! Nick! Try this on!
Phoenix:
No. And how can you tell the name of a show just by looking at a wig!?
Maya:
I, um, kinda like samurai movies.
Phoenix:
("Kinda"...?)




Costume rack







Phoenix:
There's some regular suits in among the costumes here. Those must be his own clothes.
Maya:
It'd be fun to wear one of the costumes...
Phoenix:
(I'd say you were already wearing one, myself.)




Couch







Phoenix:
Looks like someone was sleeping here. Maybe Powers did take a nap here yesterday...




Mirror







Phoenix:
They always have mirrors like this in dressing rooms. I see my hair is still nice and spiky, just how I like it.




Bag







Maya:
Hmm? This must be Powers's bag.
Phoenix:
Hey, don't open that.
Maya:
Look!
Phoenix:
An employee cardkey. That must be Powers's. It says "Studio One."
Maya:
Let's take it, Nick!
Phoenix:
Borrow it. You mean borrow.
Cardkey added to the Court Record.




Bag (subsequent times)







Maya:
I wonder what else is inside Powers's bag...?
Phoenix:
Stop that! (My partner, the thief in training.)




Table







Phoenix:
There's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Some tea and cookies...
Maya:
Nick... I'm hungry!
Phoenix:
You just had a burger!
Maya:
Yeah, but I have a separate stomach for sweets!
Phoenix:
(How many stomachs does this girl have!?)




Window







Phoenix:
It's locked. Looks like he doesn't open his window much. I guess it is kind of dusty outside.Wright & Co. Law OfficesPresent

Cardkey







Phoenix:
Could you tell me about this, ma'am?
Oldbag:
Oh that! Isn't that a studio cardkey? You better watch it! The scene of a murder is no place for sightseeing! I'll be taking that! Hand it over!
Phoenix:
W-wait! No, that's mine!

Look, I don't have a cardkey to the studio, see? I want to go pay my respects to Jack Hammer where he died.

Phoenix:
The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.

Doesn't it give you the shivers, Nick? That white tape! It's so... so real!Phoenix:
Well, the Evil Magistrate did die here. And the Steel Samurai killed him. The murder weapon was the Samurai Spear. Sounds pretty real to me...Examine









Director's chair







Maya:
Hey! Look! That's the chair the director sits in! I've always wanted to sit in one of these. Hey Nick, take a look at that. One of those black-and-white boards they clap at the start of filming! And look! A megaphone! A real live megaphone!
Phoenix:

Maya:
Ready, Nick? Action!

(This girl is more troubled than I thought...)




Film camera







Leads to:
"Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!"




Reflecting screen







Maya:
What's this?
Phoenix:
That's for reflecting light. They call it a reflecting screen or something like that. The assistant holds it during filming.
Maya:
Huh.
Phoenix:
What? Where's your enthusiasm for all things entertainment?
Maya:
Well, lighting is fine, but I'd want to be the director. Or maybe the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
(I think she's being serious...!)




Stage backdrop







Phoenix:
Looks like a backdrop for a stage. This must be used in the Steel Samurai show.
Maya:
Of course! That's the mountain, Neo Fujiyama!
Phoenix:
Doesn't the Steel Samurai take place in Olde Tokyo? Can you even see Mt. Fuji from there?
Maya:
Not Olde Tokyo, Nick! "Neo" Olde Tokyo!
Phoenix:
Oh. Right.

Maya:
Look, a ladder!
Phoenix:
That's a "step"-ladder.
Maya:
So? What's the difference? You need to stop judging things based on narrow-minded cultural assumptions, Nick!
Phoenix:
R-right... sorry. (This girl is OUT there!)




Tape outline







Phoenix:
They outlined where Jack Hammer's body lay with tape. His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. I guess that's why the head part looks like a helmet. Funny, I expected a spear stabbing would leave at least a few bloodstains. I guess the costume must have absorbed most of it...Maya:
Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!Phoenix:
Yeah! So don't touch it!Maya:
Whoa! It's heavier than I thought...???:
Hey! You! No touching that!Phoenix:
Ah, um, sorry, my partner is kind of, y'know...Maya:
"Y'know"!? No I don't know!Phoenix:

Oh, you're WP's people.Maya:
"WP"...? Oh, Will Powers. W.P., I get it.Penny:
I don't envy you guys one bit! But... do what you can for WP, okay? He'd never hurt a fly! He has to be innocent.Maya:
Don't worry, leave it to us!Talk









The day of the crime







Phoenix:
Could you tell me anything about the day of the murder?
Penny:
Yes. I was in the studio the whole day. I was the only assistant on staff that day, you see.
Maya:
Only one assistant!?
Penny:
Yes, well, the studios isn't doing so well right now. (Changed from [Yes, well, the studios aren't doing so well right now.] in the original release) And yesterday was only rehearsal for our action sequences.
Maya:
Oh, I see. (Changed from [I see. Neat!] in the original release)
Penny:
In the morning we went through the action sequences in the employee area. WP and Hammer were there, along with everyone else.
Phoenix:
The employee area--that's where Powers's dressing room is, right?
Penny:
Yes, that's the place. After eating lunch there, Mr. Hammer went to Studio One. Then I saw WP go into his dressing room. But I didn't see either of them after that.




Will Powers







Phoenix:
Did you know that Mr. Powers was sleeping in his room?
Penny:
No! I wouldn't go in there unless I had some urgent message for him... I mean, it's his private... What kind of a girl do you think I am!?
Phoenix:
W-what kind...? No, no, I'm sure you're a fine girl. Um, sorry. (So much for getting a confirmation of Powers's alibi.)Present









Anything

Um, any thoughts about this?
Penny:
Sorry... I... don't really want to think too much about what happened just yet.After clearing all Talk options:Maya:
What do we do, Nick? We haven't found anything. If WP was the only one who came to the studio... Then he has to be the killer! They even have a photograph...Phoenix:

Not really.Penny:
Actually, there's been something bothering me.Maya:
Ah hah! That's what I'm talking about! A clue! A lead!Penny:
Well, I don't know about that, but that day, just after noon, I sensed someone was here...Phoenix:
You "sensed"?Penny:
Yes, several times.Phoenix:
Some other studio employees, maybe?Penny:
No, I don't think so. The only thing we had scheduled was an action scene run-through. I was the only assistant here that day. I have a feeling it was someone from... outside.Phoenix:
R-really!?Maya:
But wait, if someone had come in here... Wouldn't that security lady have noticed them?Phoenix:
Yeah, you're right.Penny:
I'm sorry I don't have any better information than that.Maya:
No, thanks! That helps us a lot. Anything helps. Let's go put that security lady on the spot!Talk

Phoenix:
So you sensed that someone other than the regular film crew was in the studio?
Penny:
Yes... I think.

What? I saw that suspicious look on your face!Phoenix:
I wanted to ask you again about yesterday... You came here at 1:00 PM, correct? And the estimated time of Hammer's death was 2:30. Are you sure that Powers was the only one to go through here between those times?Oldbag:
Sure as can be!Maya:
But we have a witness who thinks there was "someone from outside" here that day.Oldbag:
What!?Maya:
Are you absolutely sure you were here watching the whole time?Oldbag:

Uh... um, we were just talking to the assistant in Studio One.Oldbag:
Her! She's not even a full-time employee! All you young'uns are like that nowadays, running your mouths like there was no tomorrow saying this that and the other thing. Well when I was young let me tell you we knew a thing or two about respecting our elders. Back then we did and it's a crying shame that you youths today just say what you please about poor old ladies Graaaaaaaaaaaawr!Phoenix:

Yeah, maybe. (Should I try the computer?)

Okay. Let's give it a try.
Maya:
You know how to work these things, Nick?
Phoenix:
Looks like I just have to enter in a few numbers. Let's see... first, I need the date of the murder. (It looks like the camera turned on at 1:00 PM that day... 1:00... That was when the security lady arrived at the guard station.)

Hey! Why do I have to be the villain.Maya:
Relax, it was just a joke! So, are we done for today?Phoenix:

Part 6October 18, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:
Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth:
The prosecution will show the court that at 2:30 PM on October 15, the defendant, Mr. Will Powers, killed fellow actor Jack Hammer at Studio One of Global Studios. It is impossible for anyone else to have committed this heinous crime. The evidence presented during the trial will all point to this fact.Judge:
Hmm. I see. Very well, I would like to move on to your testimony. Mr. Edgeworth, the prosecution may call its first witness.Edgeworth:
Very well, I call a most familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand. (Changed from [First, I would like to call a familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand.] in the original release)Edgeworth:
Detective, if you would briefly describe this case to the court?Gumshoe:
Yes sir! I'll explain with the guidemap here. To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see? This here is the Employee Area. The actors did a run-through of their action scenes during the morning here. This is the main gate to the studios. The security lady that works at the studios was here at 1:00 PM on that day. Past the security station there is a gate, see? Past that are the studios. And here it is... Studio One. This is the scene of the murder, where the body was found! Now, on the day of the murder, October 15, there were only three people here. The victim, Jack Hammer, the defendant, Will Powers, and a young woman, the production assistant. All the production staff were in the Employee Area until noon. Then after lunch, the victim, Jack Hammer, went to Studio One. Right after that, at 1:00 PM, the security lady got to the guard station. Now, jump ahead to later that day... 5:00 PM. The production staff came to Studio One to perform a rehearsal. Needless to say, the rehearsal was cancelled... The time of death was 2:30 PM. The "Samurai Spear" found lodged in the victim's chest was the murder weapon. That's the case, in brief. Anyone like to hear that again?Phoenix:
(Hmm... should I listen to that whole thing again...?)Skip it







Leads to:
"I think I can probably remember that..."Listen again







Phoenix:
I'm sorry, could you describe that one more time?
Gumshoe:
I shoulda known it would be you, pal! Fine. Once more for the mentally-challenged lawyer.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, yeah. Live it up while you can, Gumshoe.)
Leads back to:
"To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see?"Phoenix:
(I think I can probably remember that...)Judge:
So the murder weapon was a "spear"? How... medieval!Samurai Spear added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:
Your Honor. This case is quite simple if you ask one question: And that question is: "What did the security lady at the guard station see?"Judge:
Understood.Edgeworth:
Let's call this security officer to the stand!Edgeworth:
Will the witness declare her name?Oldbag:
... Hmm? My, aren't you a handsome fellow! I'm afraid I'm a bit flustered!Edgeworth:
Y-your name, please!Oldbag:
Oh, dearie! No need for you to be embarrassed! Just call me "grandma."Edgeworth:
YOUR NAME, PLEASE!Phoenix:
(Seems Edgeworth has a bit of trouble getting his witnesses to say their names...)Oldbag:
Wendy Oldbag, dearie. So just call me "grandma." It's practically my name! So even when I was young I was an Oldbag, but not really that was just my name dearie. Still how the other children would make fun of me and just because of my name can you believe it? But there was this boy, the captain of the chess club in junior high, and when he called me an old bag well I just cried and cried because I had a crush on him you see--Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
O-objection! I... object to the witness's talkativeness.Judge:
Objection sustained! The witness will refrain from rambling on the stand.Oldbag:
I was just getting to the good part, dearie!Edgeworth:
Perhaps we can get to the testimony?Judge:
Now, the witness was stationed at the main gate on the day of the murder, correct?Oldbag:
Yessey I was.Judge:
And to get to the scene of the murder, someone would have to pass by you?Oldbag:
You know your stuff, dearie!Judge:
... You may begin your testimony.Phoenix:
(She sure is one hell of an Oldbag...)Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Oldbag:
On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.
Poor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.
I, well, I had some errands to run that morning.
Anyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.
I was at the main gate from then until 5:00!
Now, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?
Interesting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.
It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!Judge:
You saw the defendant, then? Hmm... Very well. Let's begin the cross-examination. Mr. Wright?Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So up until that time, anyone who wanted to could go into the studio?
Oldbag:
Well, there wasn't a security guard at the gate, no. But the main gate was locked, dearie. You'd need an employee cardkey to get in.
Phoenix:
(Right... the cardkey that I have. So, what she's saying is no one who wasn't supposed to be there could get in.)
Edgeworth:
Was there anyone at the studios when you arrived at the guard station?Oldbag:
Poor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
A "run-through"...?
Oldbag:
They were working out a scene between the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate. They got the basics figured out by noon, and were to use the afternoon for practice. Rehearsal was supposed to start at 5:00. That's why poor old Hammer went to Studio One in the afternoon.
Phoenix:
(So Powers was in his dressing room sleeping... when he was supposed to be practicing! Talk about a laid-back hero...)
Edgeworth:
If there was a run-through in the morning, why did you only get there after noon?Oldbag:
I, well, I had some errands to run that morning.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What kind of "errands"?
Oldbag:
Oh, well, you know.
Phoenix:
Answer the question!
Oldbag:
Actually... I was watching poor Hammer and Powers. Observing, you know?
Phoenix:
O-observing? Weren't you supposed to be at the guard station?
Oldbag:
Whippersnapper! I told you I locked the gate, didn't I? I did my job!
Phoenix:
(I'm not sure your boss would see it that way...)
Oldbag:
Anyway! I always watch Hammer's run-throughts. Always! Never missed one in all my years.
Maya:
Wow! I want to see a Steel Samurai run-through too!
Phoenix:
You could quit being a spirit medium and take up guard duty.

Not a bad idea...Oldbag:

No, it's just, after seeing you eating those donuts in the guard station yesterday...

Phoenix:

Phoenix:

Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag! You've been saying since yesterday that you "saw Mr. Powers," correct? But you're talking about the man in this photo, aren't you!Judge:
J-just a moment, Mr. Wright. Let me see that photo! ... What is this, exactly?Phoenix:
None other than the Steel Samurai, defender of Neo Olde Tokyo. Ms. Oldbag! Is this the "Mr. Powers" that you saw!?Oldbag:
Of course! Didn't your momma teach you any sense, sonny? Anyone can plainly see that's Powers! Right?Edgeworth:
No, they can't! (Changed from [Um, yeah.] in the original release) ... Umm... well. I mean, I wonder? (Changed from [Umm... well. I wonder?] in the original release)Phoenix:
True, Mr. Powers does play the role of the Steel Samurai! But that doesn't mean Mr. Powers IS the Steel Samurai!Oldbag:

The prosecution would like to ask the old... the witness. Please make known all the information in your possession ahead of time!Oldbag:

Apparently, he sprained his ankle pretty bad.
Now, look at that picture!

Yes! And to think, he's supposed to be the Steel Samurai! What a laugh! So Powers sprained his ankle. I helped make it better for him, of course.

You... helped make it better?
Oldbag:
I kissed it where it hurt.
Judge:
L-let's just skip over that part, shall we?

Umm... hmm. Actually, well... We couldn't find it. We're looking, though.Judge:

Hmm... I suppose that's right.Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Hold it right there! We keep talking possibilities, but we have to agree that this photo shows the Steel Samurai! Nowhere in this photo can we see Mr. Will Powers!
Judge:
Hmm... The defense has a point. I also wonder if someone else not caught on camera could have killed Mr. Hammer. We have to consider that possibility, also.
Edgeworth:
Then allow me to remove that doubt from your mind, Your Honor...

"Will the witness continue her testimony, please?"Wait and see what happens







Phoenix:
(I think I'll wait and see where this goes.)

I suppose, since there weren't any additional crew members at the studios that day... It's quite likely that it was the defendant inside that costume. I see no problem with this evidence.

The prosecution's thoughts are simple. Nothing has changed. The other person who went to the studios was a boy of roughly 10 years of age. The photo we do have may not be hard evidence... But there is still no one else that could have committed this crime! I call for a verdict of "guilty" for the defendant, Mr. Will Powers!Judge:
Hmm... Very well. Mr. Wright, your thoughts?Phoenix:
The defense disagrees with the prosecution's claim. There IS another person who could have committed this crime!Judge:
Order! Interesting... Let us hear who you have in mind! However... Be aware that this court does not look kindly on accusing the innocent. If you accuse someone who is obviously innocent, you will be penalized.Phoenix:
(Right. Great. As if the stakes weren't high enough.)Judge:
So, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder?The assistant girl







Phoenix:
It was the assistant! The Steel Samurai costume was in his dressing room. She stole it, and in doing so she became the Steel Samurai!
Judge:
So you're saying the Steel Samurai in the picture is really the assistant?
Phoenix:
That's correct, Your Honor!

If you're serious, you've got guts, Mr. Wright. Remember the photo? Wasn't the Steel Samurai a little lame!? He was dragging his foot!

Remember the testimony concerning Powers's injury!!!


Oldbag:
Powers and poor Hammer were at the run-through. Oh, and me.
Phoenix:
What about the assistant?
Oldbag:
Oh, her? She was cleaning up backdrops, I think. She didn't know about Powers's ankle.


Edgeworth:
The assistant knew nothing of Mr. Power's injury! She could look the Steel Samurai look with that costume... But she couldn't walk the the Steel Samurai walk! She wouldn't have limped!

Ms. Oldbag was standing guard alone at the main gate. She was by herself... in other words, she has no alibi! She could have briefly left her post to steal the the Steel Samurai costume... Then slipped into Studio One, the scene of the murder!Judge:
W-why would she go through the trouble of wearing the Steel Samurai costume!?Phoenix:
Simple, Your Honor. She knew the camera at the gate would take her picture. If she was in his costume, she could point the finger at Mr. Powers!Judge:
I see! Excellent deductive reasoning, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:
(Ohhh yeah, right here! Sherlock Holmes II, baby!) ...? (That's odd. Isn't this the part where Edgeworth pounces...? Doesn't he usually jump up with an objection and some new damning evidence...?)Judge:
Well, Mr. Edgeworth? Does the prosecution have an opinion on this matter?Edgeworth:
... The prosecution has no meaningful objections at this time.Oldbag:
W-w-what!? What's that supposed to mean!? Oh, so you all think I did it? Is that it!? Edgey-boy! Don't just sit there, do something!Phoenix:
(What's my move? Maybe now's my chance to take this the whole way?)Press further







Leads to:
"The very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case..."Give granny a break







Phoenix:
(I guess this does kind of make it look like she's the killer. Funny, I feel bad for her all of a sudden.)
Judge:
Hmm... It's true that the witness could conceivably have committed this crime. Yet we must not forget that the victim was an action hero. As formidable as her personality may be, I doubt she'd be strong enough.
Phoenix:
(Uh oh! If he removes her from consideration, that means Mr. Powers is it! Sorry, windbag... but I don't have a choice.)
Leads to:
"The very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case..."Phoenix:
The very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case... can be used to cast doubt on Ms. Oldbag's actions on that day!Oldbag:
B-but why would I do something so horrible to poor Hammer!?Phoenix:
You forget that Mr. Powers lacks a clear motive, too.Judge:
Hmm... Indeed.Phoenix:
(That did it. Now windbag is one of the suspects. No hard feelings... I hope.)Oldbag:
Wait just a minute! What about the other person who went to the studio!? The boy! The one whose photo I erased!Judge:
He's only a grade schooler though, as you said. 2nd or 3rd grade, was it?Oldbag:
Th-that doesn't matter! When I was that age, I could pin my old man in 10 seconds, tops!Judge:
Hmm... Your thoughts, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:
That boy is not the killer.Oldbag:
What!? How can you be so sure! Oh, or is it be nice to the kids and mean to your elders day? Whippersnapper!Phoenix:
I have proof.Oldbag:
P-proof!?Judge:
Indeed? Then let's see this proof, Mr. Wright. You have proof that shows the boy could not have committed this murder?Present Cardkey







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
The scene of the murder, as we all know, was Studio One. However, you need a cardkey to enter Studio One! How could a boy with no formal relation to the studios have a cardkey!?
Leads to:
"I see!"Present Powers's(?) Photo or Samurai Spear







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Your Honor! The murder weapon was the Samurai Spear. That very spear is shown here in this photo. How could the boy have taken the spear? It's impossible!
Leads to:
"I see!"Present anything else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
This is my proof!
Judge:
... I can't see how that has anything to do with this matter, Mr. Wright? Mr. Wright. There aren't that many pieces of evidence in the Court Record. Please try not to pick the wrong ones!
Phoenix:
S-sorry, Your Honor.
Judge:
I'll ask again, Mr. Wright.
Leads back to:
"You have proof that shows the boy could not have committed this murder?"Judge:
I see! Well, would the witness care to comment on this?Oldbag:
Mrph.Phoenix:
(The windbag... speechless. This has got to be a first.)Judge:
Very well! This court will suspend proceedings on the current trial for today. Mr. Edgeworth, please find out more about your witness, Ms. Windy... what was her name?Edgeworth:
Something "Oldbag," Your Honor.Judge:
Then the prosecution will look further into this Oldbag before we continue! That is all. The court is adjourned!Oldbag:
W-wait a second! I'm not going to just sit here while you run off barking up the wrong tree... me! I'm talking!Maya:
Oh, great, stop the presses! The windbag wants to talk!Judge:
Ms. Oldbag! What is this all about? Have you omitted something from your testimony?Oldbag:
Actually, if you must know, there's something I was told not to talk about.Phoenix:
N-not to talk about?Edgeworth:
By whom!?Phoenix:
(Huh? You mean it wasn't Edgeworth who told her not to talk...?)Judge:
W-well, testify!Witness Testimony-- My Lips Were Sealed --Oldbag:
Global Studios wanted me to keep quiet about something.
There were... some other people at the studios on the day of the murder.
They said they had "nothing to do with it," see?
So they told me to just pretend they "hadn't been at the studios that day."
But if you're going to go accusing me, I'm not letting them get away scot free!Judge:

Oldbag:
Yes, well, I was surprised no one asked about it.
Phoenix:
So, where were these people?
Oldbag:
The director was in the Employee Area all morning for the run-through. He joined the producer around lunchtime and they had a meeting after that.
Edgeworth:
Where!
Oldbag:
Oh, in the Studio Two trailer.

That's enough! This court see no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for mis-interpretation of the facts.

Whew, what a day.Maya:
This is no time for relaxing, Nick! Say, you think WP's got a chance?Phoenix:
I guess that really depends on the people we found out about in today's trial.Maya:
The director and producer...?Phoenix:
Yeah, them.Maya:
Well, what are we doing here then!? Let's get to the studios!Talk









What to do







Phoenix:
What do you think we should do?
Maya:
W-what do I... huh!? Why don't we do what you just said!? We gotta get the scoop on this director and producer.
Phoenix:
Oh, right. Then there's no point hanging out here.
Maya:
That's what I've been saying! Let's get to those studios pronto!




Any ideas







Maya:
Hmm. We don't have enough information to make a case yet.
Phoenix:
That's exactly the same thing you said yesterday! Just admit it: you don't have a clue what happened.
Maya:
There's not enough information!Present









Attorney's Badge







Phoenix:
Hey, see this?
Maya:
You... really like showing that off, don't you, Nick?




Cardkey







Maya:
Hey, you still have that! Great!
Phoenix:
Well, we couldn't get into the scene of the murder without it. And its owner isn't missing it in his detention cell...
Maya:
Poor old WP...




Powers's(?) Photo







Maya:
You know, what if this really was Mr. Powers?
Phoenix:
Yeah. It's hard to say. We don't really know anyone else it could be. I seriously doubt it was that old windbag.
Maya:
So Mr. Powers is... lying?
Phoenix:
He really doesn't seem the type, does he. (Curiouser and curiouser...)




Samurai Spear







Maya:
I wish I had my own Samurai Spear! You'd by my own personal pincushion, Nick!
Phoenix:
Me!? Why me!?




Anything else







Maya:
Sorry, I don't know how that will help us figure this out.October 18Detention CenterVisitor's RoomWill:
Oh, Mr. Wright! Thank you for earlier.Phoenix:
Not at all. We got lucky, to tell the truth.Maya:
You can say that again!Phoenix:
Let's not.Maya:
So, WP! Do you have any leads that might get us going in the right direction?Will:
Hmm... S-sorry, but no.Maya:
Be sure to tell us anything that comes to mind, no matter how small.Phoenix:
We can't rely on getting lucky again tomorrow.Will:
Y-yes... *sniff*Examine









Security guard







Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room.Talk









The fanboy







Phoenix:
Do, er, "fanboys" sneak into the studios often?
Will:
No, not that I know of. That security lady's pretty strict with them.
Maya:
But, in today's testimony, didn't she say they were often hanging around?
Will:
The kids really, really love the Steel Samurai. They sneak past when she's not looking, I guess.




The director







Phoenix:
Was the director present at the morning run-through?
Will:
Y-yes, yes he was. He was directing how the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate should move.
Maya:
Why didn't you tell us that before!?
Will:
W-well, just, the studio asked us to keep quiet...
Maya:
That has nothing to do with this! I hate to repeat myself, but Nick here is a newbie lawyer! Fresh off the bar! When he loses, he's going to lose big!
Will:
I... I see. *sniff*
Phoenix:
(Whose side is she on!?)
Maya:
You aren't hiding anything else from us, are you!?
Will:
N-no, I sure hope not.Present









Cardkey







Phoenix:
We found this cardkey in your dressing room.
Will:
Oh, that's mine, yes.
Maya:
Can people outside the studios get these cards?
Will:
I don't think so. Even I have to return the card. Once the show's done filming, that is.
Maya:
Huh...




Powers's(?) Photo







Phoenix:
Regarding this photograph...
Will:
Y-yes...?
Phoenix:
This really, truly, absolutely isn't you, right?
Will:
R-right. *sniff* I was sleeping in my dressing room the whole time, honest.
Phoenix:
But who else could have worn it!?
Maya:
Your costume was in your dressing room?
Will:
Yes. I guess they snuck in and took it while I was asleep.
Phoenix:
(But who!?)




Samurai Spear







Phoenix:
Regarding the murder weapon...
Will:
Yes?
Phoenix:
Is it heavy, that spear?
Will:
It's pretty hefty, yeah. I don't think the average person would be able to swing it around effectively.
Phoenix:
Hmm...
Maya:
And... that's the spear that broke or something during the morning run-through?
Will:
Oh yes, I goofed on a round kick, you see... I broke the spear. The security lady fixed it for me right away though.
Maya:
With duct tape. We heard.




Anything else







Will:
E-excuse me. Thank you for showing me that, whatever it is. I wish I could think of some way I could help you... S-sorry. *sniff*October 18, 2:16 PMGlobal StudiosMain GateMaya:
No one's here.Phoenix:
Right, now that they have Ms. Oldbag in custody. I guess they don't have anyone else to replace her...Maya:
H-hey! In the guard station! Look! She left her donuts! ... ... What? I wasn't going to eat them!Examine









Computer







Phoenix:
The computer that runs the studio security cameras. Huh? It looks like it's been turned off for the day.




Guard station







Phoenix:
The security guard station. Ms. Oldbag must like junk food. There's a mountain of it on the desk in there.




Main gate







Phoenix:
The main entrance to the studios. They probably have a police officer on patrol out there.October 18Studio One EntranceMaya:
Hey, Nick. It looks like Detective Gumshoe isn't here today.Phoenix:
You're right. He's probably up to his neck in paperwork after the commotion at today's trial.Maya:
So, Nick... Remember that "Studio Two" we heard about at the trial today? It was down that path with the fallen tree, right?Phoenix:
Yeah, I think that's what they said.Maya:
Maybe the director and the rest of them are there today? Now's our chance, Nick! Let's check it out!Examine









Bench







Phoenix:
I'm bushed. Maybe I'll sit down here for a bit.
Maya:
This is exactly why I don't want to get old, ever.
Phoenix:
H-hey! I'm still young! I'm just tired!
Maya:
Nick, when you start having to say "I'm still young," you know it's all over.
Phoenix:
(But... but I AM still young!)




Left path







Phoenix:
In the trial, they said Studio Two was down this path. The monkey head is in the way, but we should be able to get by it without a problem.
Maya:
This monkey head is real heavy!
Phoenix:
Well, it did knock that tree over when it fell.
Maya:
Both of these, the monkey head and the tree, fell the day of the murder, didn't they.
Phoenix:
Yeah, that's what Detective Gumshoe said.




Statue with broken head







Phoenix:
The studio mascot. Apparently it's a monkey of some kind. I've never seen a monkey with a nose like that before!
Maya:
Why don't they put his head back on? Maybe we should ask that assistant?
Phoenix:
I'm not sure we really want her fixing anything. And you'd probably need a crane to move that thing.
Maya:
Probably so.




Security camera







Phoenix:
That's the security camera that automatically takes pictures of people here. It took two pictures on the day of the murder, before the actual time of death. One of them was the Steel Samurai. The other was a grade school boy. It doesn't seem to be switched on today.




Studio One entrance







Phoenix:
The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.




Welcome sign







Maya:
It says "Welcome."
Phoenix:
They let people in here when they're not filming, right?
Maya:
Nick! Let's come here some day! Whaddya say?
Phoenix:
Sure, if that security lady lets us in.October 18Studio OneMaya:
I... don't really want to be in here.Phoenix:
Yeah... It is a murder scene.Maya:
I want to go someplace else. Nick?Phoenix:
(*sigh*...)Examine









Film camera







Maya:
Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!
Phoenix:
Yeah! So don't touch it!
Maya:
Hey, smile, Nick, you're a star!
Phoenix:
S-stop that!




Reflecting screen







Phoenix:
That's for reflecting light. They call it a reflecting screen or something like that.
Maya:
Huh.
Phoenix:
What? Where's your enthusiasm for all things entertainment?
Maya:
Well, lighting is fine, but I'd want to be the director. Or maybe the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
(I think she's being serious...!)




Stage backdrop







Phoenix:
Looks like a backdrop for a stage. This must be used in the Steel Samurai show.
Maya:
Of course! That's the mountain, Neo Fujiyama!
Phoenix:
Doesn't the Steel Samurai take place in Olde Tokyo? Can you even see Mt. Fuji from there?
Maya:
Not Olde Tokyo, Nick! "Neo" Olde Tokyo!October 18Studio Two EntranceMaya:
This... is Studio Two?Phoenix:
I thought so...Maya:
It doesn't really look much like a "studio," does it?Phoenix:
No, that it does not.Maya:
Hey... There's a trailer over there.Phoenix:
It looks pretty sturdy for a movie set trailer.Maya:
Are we sure this is a studio?Examine









Incinerator







Phoenix:
An incinerator. Apparently they just put this one in. It's already covered in soot. They must not clean it much.




Lunch table







Phoenix:
Looks like two people ate here. There's nothing left on the plates.
Maya:
Hey, so they ate t-bone steaks too.
Phoenix:
What is it with steaks around here?
Maya:
Hey! There's always room for steak! But... something does seem out of place...
Phoenix:
What?
Maya:
I... don't know. It just feels "odd."




Number "2" sign







Phoenix:
There's a big "2" painted here.
Maya:
Probably because this is Studio Two?
Phoenix:
Probably... Though it doesn't look anything like a studio.




Studio van







Phoenix:
A light van for moving staff and equipment around. They've kept it in pretty good shape. Looks like it'd run fine.
Maya:
Well, let's go for a drive!
Phoenix:
Sure... if I had a license.
Maya:
Nick! You don't have a driver's license!?
Phoenix:
But, look, I have this!
Maya:
Why are you showing me your attorney's badge, Nick?




Flower garden







Phoenix:
There're some flowers here.
Maya:
Wow, so pretty! They're taking good care of these.
Phoenix:
Don't get to [sic] close. That fence looks dangerous.




Storage materials







Phoenix:
These look like materials for making a movie set.
Maya:
They've been sitting here for quite some time. This might as well be a junkyard.




Trailer







Phoenix:
On closer inspection, this trailer looks like it's been here for a while. I don't think this is part of some temporary film set.




Trailer door







Maya:
Nick! Let's go inside!
Phoenix:
You think it's okay...? Oh well. It's locked.
Maya:
Aww... shucks.October 18Global StudiosEmployee AreaMaya:

You mean that one? (Wow, what a mess...)Penny:
I... I know... I'm not so good with handiwork. Some assistant, right?Maya:
Yeah, but you do work on the props, and the backdrops, right?Penny:
R-right. Just... lots of times they end up looking worse than they did before I fixed them.Maya:
Oh? Oh! Well, I'm sure these things happen. Nothing to worry yourself about!Penny:
You're right! I won't!Phoenix:

Right! See you later, then!Penny:
Good luck with your investigation.Examine









Taped cardboard barrier







Maya:
So, the fanboy they were talking about in the trial today... He came in through that drain?
Phoenix:
So it seems. I guess they covered it up in a hurry.
Maya:
Hey... Hey, Nick! If that drain's covered, the boy won't be able to get in.
Phoenix:
Uh, yeah. I think that was the idea...?
Maya:
I feel kinda sorry for him, though. Don't you?
Phoenix:
What, you want to rip the grate off?
Maya:
Really, Nick? We can!?
Phoenix:
(Whoa... she's serious? Uh oh...)



Rip it open







Phoenix:
Well, I guess some things are just made to be broken.
Maya:
Yay! You know, Nick, you're pretty swell sometimes.
Phoenix:
(Sometimes...?)
Maya:
Hiii-ya! There. That should make the kids happy.
Phoenix:
The things we do...
Leads back to examination




Leave it be







Phoenix:
Nah, I think we should leave it on. They only just repaired it. And if we take it off, that assistant will get yelled at by you-know-who.
Maya:
Yeah... I guess so.
Phoenix:
(Wow! I didn't expect her to take it that hard...)
Leads back to examination





Drain grate (after selecting "Rip it open" upon examining taped cardboard barrier)







Phoenix:
The drain grate is off. And I know who did it.
Maya:
Now the kids'll be able to come in again. Doesn't it make you feel great to do a good deed like that?
Phoenix:
(Must be nice to live so free of guilt.)




Lunch table







Phoenix:
The remains of yesterday's lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak.




Dressing room door







Phoenix:
The door to the dressing room. It's not locked.
Maya:
Hey, Nick! Let's go in! Maybe there'll be something else to steal?
Phoenix:
H-hey! We're not thieves!
Maya:
But we did take that cardkey...
Phoenix:
W-we borrowed that! There's a difference.




Vending machine







Phoenix:
Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks or something. Popcorn, at least!
Maya:
W-wait! Look! "Samurai Soda"! Nick! Try this!
Phoenix:
Be my guest.
Maya:
Okay! Oh, too bad, it's sold out.October 18Global StudiosDressing RoomMaya:
This is where the Steel Samurai costume was, on the day of the murder.Phoenix:
That's what Mr. Powers says, at least. I guess they snuck in and took it while he was sleeping.Maya:
But Nick, what if Mr. Powers hadn't been sleeping? I wonder what the killer was planning on doing then?Phoenix:
Huh... (She's got a point!)Examine









Cosmetics







Phoenix:
There's an array of cosmetics here. According to Maya, that wig was used in some old TV show...
Maya:
"Samurai Boogey-Woogey," Nick! Get with the picture!
Phoenix:
Look, explain to me how you can identify a show just by seeing a wig!?
Maya:
I, um, kinda like samurai movies.
Phoenix:
("Kinda"...?)




Costume rack







Phoenix:
There's some regular suits in among the costumes here. Those must be Mr. Powers's personal clothes.




Couch







Phoenix:
Looks like someone was sleeping here. Maybe Powers did take a nap here, like he said.




Bag







Maya:
Mr. Powers's bag. I wonder what's inside? Hey! Supermarket tabloids? Wow. I'm kind of shocked.
Phoenix:
Maya! Leave those alone! (Wolf Men Found On Mars...? I'll have to buy that issue!)




Table







Phoenix:
There's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Some tea and cookies...
Maya:
Wait... Nick!
Phoenix:
W-what now?
Maya:
These snacks... they've passed the expiration date!
Phoenix:
... Then don't eat them.
Maya:
*grumble* (They're snacks! They're meant to be eaten!)




Window







Phoenix:
It's locked. I guess he doesn't open his window much. It is kind of dusty outside.Studio - Main Gate (after selecting "Rip it open" upon examining taped cardboard barrier in Global Studios - Employee Area)Penny:
Oh... hello.Maya:
Ho hoh! You look a little out of place.Penny:
It's the clothes, isn't it? I thought my camo vest might do the trick... Kind of an "alternative guard fashion" thing.Examine









Guard station







Phoenix:
The security guard station. I can see the computer that runs the security cameras.
Penny:
Oh, please don't touch anything in there. The security lady would knock the stuffing out of me if she knew.Talk









The studios







Phoenix:
So, how are the studios doing?
Penny:
There's police wandering around everywhere, it's terrible. They won't even let me clean up. Don't want me "disturbing evidence." I haven't even cleaned up our lunch plates from the day of the murder!
Phoenix:
You mean those plates with the steak bones left over on them in the employee area?
Penny:
Yeah. Can you believe it?




The fanboy







Maya:
Do kids sneak in here a lot?
Penny:
Well... I don't think there's that many of them, but I do see one in particular a bunch. He's always gawking at the sets, or snapping pictures. You should see Old Windbag's eyes flash when she sees him. She has a bit of trouble catching him though...




The director, et al.







Phoenix:
I heard something at the trial today. They said that the director and producer were here the day of the murder...
Penny:
Oh, sorry... I was in the prop storage room, so I didn't see them. I guess they were here, though. The studio head seemed pretty eager to keep us quiet.
Maya:
So they were trying to protect the director?
Penny:
More the producer, really. The producer's our real star here. She saved these studios from the brink of disaster and kept them running. I don't think we'd still be in business if it weren't for that producer!
Phoenix:
(The producer, huh?)Present









Cardkey







Penny:
Wow, they gave a lawyer one of those cardkeys?
Phoenix:
Well, I'm sort of borrowing it.
Penny:
I see. You better be careful not to lose that. They're very strict about those cardkeys here.
Phoenix:
(I guess they're pretty good about keeping these out of outsider's hands.) Thanks, I'll be careful.




Powers's(?) Photo







Phoenix:
Could you take a look at this?
Penny:
That's Mr. Powers. Why is he dragging his leg like that? What is this, anyway?
Phoenix:
(Looks like she didn't know about this photo or the injury that morning.) Uh... Never mind.




Samurai Spear







Phoenix:
Say, you work with the props, right? About that murder weapon...
Penny:
You mean the Samurai Spear? Yeah, it's a prop, but it's still pretty heavy. I hate having to carry that thing around.
Phoenix:
(So you'd have to be pretty strong to use that as a weapon, it sounds like. Why is Mr. Powers the only person I can think of!?)

The day of the crime







Phoenix:
Did you notice anything unusual on the day of the murder?
Manella:
Oh, I know who j00 d00dz are. That security lady told j00 about us, eh?
Phoenix:
That's right.
Manella:
It was a pretty regular day. We had a run-through for an action scene in the morning. Then a meeting from lunchtime in the Studio Two trailer. Heh. I was so busy I didn't even get a chance to eat lunch! :(
Phoenix:
A t-bone steak, was it?
Manella:
Yeah... sux0rz! I hate missing out on food...
Maya:
Nick... what does "Sucksores" mean?
Phoenix:
No idea...
Manella:
Anyway, I was in a meeting from noon till after 4:00. With the producer, and some bigwigs from the network.
Phoenix:
(Mr. Hammer's time of death was estimated at 2:30 PM. If he's telling the truth, that meeting gives him an alibi...)




The producer (appears after "The day of the crime")







Phoenix:
About the producer who was at the meeting with you...
Manella:
Oh, you mean Dee Vasquez? She's a genius. M4d sk1llz, all the way. Scary, though. *sweats* She brought these studios back from the brink of destruction. She's the one who made it possible for me to make the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
You had a meeting with her on the day of the murder, right?
Manella:
Yeah, we were together from noon to 4:00 PM, the whole time.




The bigwigs (appears after "The day of the crime")







Phoenix:
Who exactly are these "bigwigs" people keep mentioning?
Manella:
Oh, the boss over at the network, and some sponsors. Also a few production guys. They piled into a limousine and got here right around noon. Major tension! *sweats*
Phoenix:
Were all of them with you the entire time?
Manella:
Yeah, unfortunately. They're all gray-haired geezers... *scowl*

Powers's(?) Photo







Manella:

Oh... o-okay... huff. J-just be sure to... huff... give it b-back... puff.

Anything else







Oldbag:
Huff... huff... puff... ... huff... puff... haaah! ... Huff.. huff... puff... huff... puff... huff... hooo!

What's this...? A Steel Samurai trading card?Oldbag:
That sneaky kid dropped it! I figure it's pretty important to him, though.Phoenix:

Welcome sign







Phoenix:
"Welcome"... I wonder if the murder will make this place famous, too.Inside Studio OneExamine









Director's chair







Phoenix:
A classic director's chair. I'm surprised they don't have an extra large one for Mr. Manella.




Film camera







Phoenix:
A collection of expensive film equipment. I can't even begin to imagine how much just one of these costs. If we broke one, we'd go bankrupt for sure.




Reflecting screen







Phoenix:
A panel for reflecting light. They call it a "reflecting board" or something.




Stage backdrop







Phoenix:
A stage backdrop. This is "Neo Fujiyama," according to Maya. It looks incredibly fake, but I guess the kids don't mind.




(Step)ladder







Phoenix:
A perfectly normal stepladder. I've never actually used one. I don't like heights. I'm a firm belever that humankind was made to keep both feet on the ground.Outside Studio TwoExamine









Lunch table







Phoenix:
Looks like two people ate here. There's nothing left on the plates.




Number "2" sign







Phoenix:
There's a big "2" painted here. Probably because this is Studio Two? Probably... Though it doesn't look anything like a studio.




Studio van







Phoenix:
A light van for moving staff and equipment around. They've kept it in pretty good shape. Looks like it'd run fine.




Flower garden







Phoenix:
Nameless flowers bloom in solitude. They probably have a proper name... But it is not for me to know. Not now, nor ever till the end of my days. ... I need a vacation.




Storage materials







Phoenix:
These look like materials for making a movie set. They've been sitting here for quite some time. This might as well be a junkyard.




Trailer door







Phoenix:
The door is unlocked. We could probably just walk right in.TrailerExamine









Left poster







Phoenix:
Another old movie poster. "'The Singing Samurai' starring Jack Hammer." What the hell do samurai sing about? Chopping off heads?
Mia:
It's a samurai musical set in ancient Japan.
Phoenix:
A s-samurai musical? Is that even a genre!? Well, I'm impressed. You know your stuff, Mia.
Mia:
Oh, Maya's the real fan. I just picked a little up.




Middle poster







Phoenix:
"'Samurai Summer' starring Jack Hammer." This poster looks like it's been hanging here for years.
Mia:
This is one of Maya's favorite movies.
Phoenix:
Maybe we should replace the poster in the office with this one?
Mia:
That... would be kind of sad.October 18Global StudiosEmployee AreaPhoenix:

Yeah. His name's "Cody Hackins."Mia:

Bicycle







Phoenix:
Looks like one of those electric-powered bicycles. I dunno about these. I mean, what's the point?
Mia:
It makes it a lot easier to go up hills!
Phoenix:
Where have I heard that line before...?




Dressing room door







Phoenix:
The door to the dressing room. It's not locked.
Mia:
This is where Cody ran... Let's go in and see if we can get him to talk.




Storage room door







Phoenix:
That must be the storage room. That's where they keep all the film equipment.




Vending machine







Phoenix:
Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks, or something. Popcorn, at least!
Mia:
Look at this! "Spaghetti in a Soda Can"...?
Phoenix:
S-spaghetti? Wouldn't just the sauce come out and the noodles all stay stuck inside?
Mia:
"Best when slammed." I guess they want you to drink it in one gulp...?

Phoenix:
There's an array of cosmetics here. According to Maya, that wig was used in some old TV show...

You don't know "Samurai Boogey-Woogey"!? You're even lamer than I thought!
Phoenix:
(Why does everybody but me know about this show!?)




Powers's bag







Phoenix:
Mr. Powers's bag.
Mia:
Now, Phoenix, it's not polite to look through other people's belongings.
Phoenix:
H-hey, don't look at me! (Tell that to your sister!)




Table







Phoenix:
There's a box of snacks on the table, and some cans of soda. They're all empty. I'm glad Maya isn't here to see this. She'd be devastated.
Mia:
Sorry? What was that about Maya?
Phoenix:
O-oh, nothing.Talk









The Steel Samurai







Phoenix:
The Steel Samurai's so cool. I think he's the, um, the "bomb."

Hah! What would a lamer like you know about the Steel Samurai!

"You are"... huh?
Cody:
"U.R." You know, "ultra rare"! That card's really hard to get! Man, for a grown-up, you sure are dumb!
Phoenix:
I'll give you this... IF you help me.
Cody:
But that's my card! By offering me something I already own, you're in effect eschewing the very basis of our consumer society, namely the principle of fair trade! Man, for a grown-up, you sure are dumb!
Phoenix:
(W-what do they teach these kids in school these days!? Quantum physics!?)
Cody:
Whatever, I don't need that card.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Cody:
I got a double. Just keep it. It's yours.
Phoenix:
(What!? After I went through all that trouble...)
Cody:
If you want to trade, find me a REALLY rare card!
Phoenix:
"Really rare"!? You mean there's something rarer than "Ultra Rare"!?
Cody:
Ultra Rare Premium cards are way rarer than plain Ultra Rare cards! Come ON! Man, for a grown-up, you sure are dumb!

Nope. You missed it, though. The security lady was chasing around after the boy so fast I thought she'd collapse. Of course, he got away in the end. Boy, was she mad!

She was squeezing donuts through her clenched fists back at the guard station.

The Steel Samurai







Phoenix:

Cody... I need to ask you something very important. What did you see on the day of the incident?Cody:
... I got here that day around 2:00... I had to come in through the woods out back so that old lady wouldn't see me. I got kinda lost, though. I was in there for maybe a half hour or so. Then I finally got to the studio. After that...Mia:
What is it, Cody?Cody:
Th-the Steel Samurai killed the bad guy! He used his Samurai Spear! Just like always! One shot, one kill! It happened so fast... I got scared. I went home after that.Phoenix:
I... I see. It must have been hard for you.Cody:
Man, you say those nice things but it's so obvious you aren't speaking from the heart.Phoenix:
(Umm... right.) Mia?Mia:
Yes?Phoenix:
I think we can say for sure this means the Steel Samurai did it.Mia:
True enough.Phoenix:
And the director has an alibi, so it wasn't him.Mia:
Indeed.Phoenix:
So... the only person left who it could have been is Will Powers!Mia:
... I have to admit, it's kind of a shock. But if you put this boy on the witness stand, your client will be "guilty" for sure.Phoenix:

I think that would be wise. Best to leave this one alone.???:

Why do you look so... unhappy?Phoenix:
O-oh! Oh, nothing! Eh heh heh. Really, it's nothing. Right, Mia? (Uh oh. She looks even unhappier...)Mia:
Phoenix. Your client is now practically a dead man walking... Perhaps that's why I feel particularly close to him.Phoenix:
This is no time for dead-people jokes, please.Mia:
You know we're going into this trial utterly defenseless. Yet, if Mr. Powers is truly innocent... We should be able to find something overlooked in the evidence to prove it.Phoenix:
Something "overlooked"...?Mia:
We have to find something, Phoenix, today. It's that, or lose the trial.Phoenix:
(This isn't going to be easy.)October 19, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:
Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth:
An unexpected fact has come to the attention of the court. Yesterday, we learned that there were other people present at the studios. Today, I would like to show evidence proving they had nothing to do with the murder.Judge:
Very well. You may call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth.Phoenix:
(I wonder if it'll be that producer...) (Changed from [I wonder if that producer is going to come out...] in the original release)Edgeworth:
The prosecution calls Mr. Sal Manella to the stand.Phoenix:

S... Sal Manella. I'm a director. Television.Judge:
Were you at Global Studios on the day of the murder?Manella:
Y-yes, Your Honor.Judge:
Hmm... Very well. Please testify to the court about the events of that day.Mia:
Phoenix. Let's start by picking this testimony apart. If Powers is innocent, you know what that means. Someone in the trailer on that day did it!Phoenix:
R-right. (She doesn't waste any time putting on the pressure!)Witness Testimony-- The Day of the Murder --Manella:
I was at the studios from around 9:00 that morning.
During the morning, I was doing... umm... an action scene run-through.
It took a lot more time than I thought it would.
I hear that everyone else ate lunch in the Employee Area...
But I had a meeting in the Studio Two trailer, so I ended up skipping lunch.
We were in the meeting until around 4:00...
During the meeting, well, I'm pretty sure no one left their chairs.
That's about it.Judge:
Hmm... The time of Mr. Hammer's death was 2:30 PM. And according to your testimony, you were in a meeting at that time. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.Cross Examination-- The Day of the Murder --Manella:

Phoenix:
Yeah?
Mia:
Doesn't something about that seem odd to you?



Not at all







Phoenix:
Well, no, not really. Seems pretty straightforward.
Mia:
Oh. Perhaps I was wrong, then.
Leads back to cross-examination




It's a little vague







Phoenix:
Actually, there is something bothering me. Mr. Manella, just now you said "steak, at least." So you ate something other than steak?
Manella:
Yeah, good call! I had some chocolate in my pocket, which I used to stave off starvation!
Phoenix:
I see... (Is that all? I was sure I was on to something there.)
Leads back to cross-examination




It's contradictory







Phoenix:
Yeah, it does seem odd, now that you mention it. Mr. Manella!
Manella:
H-hmm? W-what do j00 mean? *sweats*
Phoenix:
When I went to Studio Two, I saw something on the table there. (Changed from [When I went to that trailer, I saw something on the table.] in the original release) There were two plates--the same kind of plates as the ones in the Employee Area. (Changed from [There were two plates on the table--the same kind of plates as in the Employee Area.] in the original release) Who ate lunch there?
Manella:
M-mmpf! No, er, ah, um, eh heh. Good call! *sweats* I, er, I was embarrassed so I didn't mention it... But I did eat, after all.
Phoenix:
A t-bone steak, you mean?
Manella:
Yeah, well, I mean the assistant went through all that trouble... I brought it to the trailer thinking I could eat it later.
Phoenix:
(Clearly a man who likes to eat. I'd suspected as much...) So, when exactly did you eat it?
Manella:
We took one break during that meeting. I, er, wolfed it down then. *drool*
Phoenix:
(A mental image I will carry with me to my grave... Wait a second...! If they took a break in that meeting, that contradicts his testimony! I'll press on that one a bit more...)
Leads back to cross-examinationManella:
We were in the meeting until around 4:00...Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What were you discussing?
Manella:
The Steel Samurai story, and our budget. Get this! The sponsors turn to me and say, "Mr. Manella. Those scripts of yours are not appropriate for children." Can j00 believe it!?
Phoenix:
(Actually, I kind of can.) So, nobody left the table during the whole meeting?Manella:
During the meeting, well, I'm pretty sure no one left their chairs.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
You didn't take a single break?
Manella:
Er... well... Y-yeah! Not a one! *sweats*

Phoenix. If his alibi holds, Powers is finished. Press him as hard as you can and find out where he's lying!Phoenix:

Wait a second! Mr. Manella, you've just contradicted yourself! Didn't you just tell the court that you ate that t-bone steak during a break?Manella:
Oops! ROFL!Phoenix:
Well?Manella:
Umm...Judge:
Mr. Manella, what's this all about?Manella:
W-well, yeah, I guess we did take a little break.Mia:
Phoenix! Great job! If they took a break, one of them could have gone to the studio during that time!Phoenix:
Your Honor! I call on the witness to testify to the court about this break!Judge:
Very well. Mr. Manella, your testimony, please.Manella:
Urk!Edgeworth:
Heh heh heh...Phoenix:

Not enough time for someone to, say, commit murder in Studio One! LOL!
That's only just enough time to eat a t-bone steak, if you ask me! *steams*Judge:
Hmm... I don't think it would even be enough time for that, but that's just me. Very well. You may begin the cross-examination.Cross Examination-- The Break --Manella:
Yeah, FWIW, we took a break... ROFL!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What time exactly did you take this break?
Manella:
Hmm... I'd say it was from around 2:30 or so until 2:45.
Phoenix:
(2:30!!! That's the time of death! So he could have gone to Studio One, killed Hammer, and come back... I guess it's possible, time-wise...)
Edgeworth:
...Manella:
But it was only 15 minutes! 15! That's only 13 in Base 12!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What were you doing for those 15 minutes?
Manella:
Eating my t-bone steak! What else!?
Phoenix:
There were two plates on the trailer table...?
Manella:
Oh, right. The other one was Diva's... sorry, Dee Vasquez's plate.
Phoenix:
(Dee Vasquez... the producer.)
Edgeworth:
To eat a t-bone steak in 15 minutes... that's quite a feat.Manella:

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
I have to say, you look like a guy who gets through his meals pretty fast.
Manella:
Well, I was facing a cold, slightly chewy t-bone steak... Even I have to take my time eating that kind of food. LOLMia:
Well, Phoenix?Phoenix:
That testimony was too short to wring any kind of useful information out of!Mia:
All you have to do is prove that he was able to go to Studio One in that time!Phoenix:
(Oh, great. Is that all...)Phoenix:
Why is that?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
Haven't we had enough of this pointless line of questioning? Your Honor! The testimony to this point has made one certain fact painfully clear: The people in the trailer had nothing to do with this murder! It was impossible for any of them to go to Studio One!Phoenix:
What!?Edgeworth:
Something wrong, Mr. Wright? Surely you aren't suggesting one of the people in the trailer went to Studio One!Judge:
Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright?Mia:
Phoenix, this is critical! Think about it before you give your answer!Judge:
Do you claim someone from the trailer went to Studio One?I claim it, and claim it loud







Phoenix:
(If I agree to let everyone in that trailer off the hook then the trial is over... Mr. Powers will be found guilty for sure!) The victim was murdered at 2:30, the exact time of the break in the meeting. With 15 minutes, murder is certainly a possibility!
Judge:
Hmm... I suppose you might say that...
Phoenix:
(Alright, I've got the judge thinking now!)
Edgeworth:
Tsk, tsk, tsk... Never a dull moment with you, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
What's your point, Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
You've been doing your homework, haven't you? Look at the Court Record.
Phoenix:
The Court Record...?
Edgeworth:
Surely, you knew that from 2:15 to 4:00 the path between the studios was blocked? Mrs. Monkey's head had fallen across the path!
Phoenix:
Whoa! You're right!
Edgeworth:
True, the break in the trailer meeting came right at the time of death... However! The path from there to the scene of the crime was blocked! The fallen Mrs. Monkey head barred the way!
Phoenix:
... (It's actually "Mr. Monkey," but Edgeworth has a point... And somehow, I feel no desire to correct him.)
Judge:
No counter-argument, Mr. Wright? Then I'm afraid you lose this round.
Leads to:
"I believe we have seen enough evidence."No, it's impossible.







Phoenix:
(I don't want to write off so many possible suspects... But I can't keep claiming the impossible, either...) I agree that it was impossible for anyone in the trailer to go to the studio in that time.
Edgeworth:
Ha hah! I thought you might be thoughtlessly treading on thin ice again! But I see you had at least an inkling of the truth.
Judge:
What do you mean, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
It's quite simple... True, the break in the trailer meeting came right at the time of death... However! The path from there to the scene of the crime was blocked! The fallen Mrs. Monkey head barred the way! At around 2:15, a strong gust of wind knocked off the studio mascot's head. Ergo! When the people in the trailer took a break at 2:30, the way to the studio was blocked. Blocked... by Mrs. Monkey's severed head!
Phoenix:
... (It's actually "Mr. Monkey," but Edgeworth has a point... And somehow, I feel no desire to correct him.)
Leads to:
"I believe we have seen enough evidence."Edgeworth:
I believe we have seen enough evidence. I would like to relieve Mr. Manella from the stand.Phoenix:
(Wh-what? It's over?)Judge:
Very well. The court's opinion on this case is as follows: We have found that there were several other people in Studio 2 on the day of the murder. However, it is also clear that none of these people could have gone to Studio One. They therefore have no relation to this case. Furthermore, with regards to the photo of the Steel Samurai... Given the size of the costume, no one other than Mr. Powers could have worn it that day. All that is lacking is decisive evidence that he is the one who did it. If we had that, I'm afraid I would have to find Mr. Powers guilty.Edgeworth:
Your Honor. The prosecution is pleased to announce that we indeed have decisive evidence: a witness.Judge:
Who is this witness, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:
My witness saw the very moment when the Steel Samurai skewered the victim!Judge:

What do we do now, Mia? If everyone in that trailer has an alibi...Mia:
... I'm sorry, Phoenix. I guess I was wrong.Phoenix:
M-Mia! Don't tell me you're giving up! If you give up, what hope do I have...?Mia:
... Don't get me wrong. I've never given up on a trial before, not while there was a chance. Only one thing became clear in your cross-examination. The people in the trailer could not have gone to Studio One. I thought there was more to it than that... But I was wrong. That's all there is.Will:
Umm... Er... What's going to happen to me? It kinda seems like everyone in that courtroom thinks I did it... They think I'm a murderer!Mia:
Don't worry, Mr. Powers. If you are innocent, we will prove it. I guarantee it. Leave it to us, and... be yourself. Be strong. You are the Steel Samurai, hero to children everywhere, after all.Will:
I... You... Thanks. *sniff*Mia:

Court is back in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:
The prosecution has a concern. As our witness is a grade schooler of tender years, and this is a murder case... we worry that the defense might cause unnecessary trauma with his cruel questioning.

(Nice to see Edgeworth taking the moral high ground...)Edgeworth:
However, we have no choice. The prosecution calls Cody Hackins to the stand.Edgeworth:

I wanted to see a Steel Samurai rehearsal, just once.

I went through the woods off the path, so that old lady wouldn't catch me.
I was going for the studio.
I got kinda lost on the way, though. For about 30 minutes.
When I came out by the studio, there was the Steel Samurai!
It totally rocked! Right before my eyes, out came the bad guy!
Of course, the Steel Samurai took him down! Pow!

Um, well... er, that's the thing...Mia:
Phoenix! I believe you're on the right track with this! Think: why didn't Cody see the climax of the fight? I know you! You can figure this out!Judge:
Mr. Wright, your answer! We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai... Why wouldn't he watch the climax of the fight?He couldn't watch it







Phoenix:
Because he couldn't watch it! How could he calmly watch a murder taking place at his age!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Just a moment, please... One thing has become quite clear in this boy's testimony. He did not believe he was witnessing a murder! He was watching the Steel Samurai fight, like on TV. The more real the fight, the more he would have watched!

Umm... huh.

I have to agree with Mr. Edgeworth. Well, Mr. Wright. Do you have another explanation?

Good job, Phoenix! Cody was lying, clearly. Smart of you to realize there was no way he could just stand there, watching his hero... and not take a picture!Phoenix:
Right! Cody? There was only one reason why you would have looked away from the fight. And that was because you wanted to take a picture. But having just received your camera, you weren't used to using it yet! So, you missed the climax of the fight. Correct?Cody:
... ... ... Yeah.Mia:
Well, Phoenix. I'll bet you anything he's hiding more than that. Have him testify again!Phoenix:
R-right. (Mia means business!) Your Honor. The defense would like to request that Cody Hackins testify once more.Judge:

Yeah, you're right, pops.
The Steel Samurai had just escaped from the clutches of the villain.
So I held up my camera to take a picture!
But the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it.

2025-01-22 14:44:42,796 - INFO - Assistant reply: Let's break down Cody's testimony to identify any potential contradictions with the evidence available. Here is his testimony:

1. "Yeah, you're right, pops."
2. "The Steel Samurai had just escaped from the clutches of the villain."
3. "So I held up my camera to take a picture!"
4. "But the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it."
5. "Th-that's all that happened. Yup."

Now, let's cross-examine Cody's testimony with what we have. In Cody's Camera (evidence #15) description, it mentions that Cody always carries his new digital camera with him, although he's still learning to use it. It suggests he is not entirely familiar with how to operate it, which supports the claim that he missed the shot due to the lens not opening in time.

However, let's contrast that with '"Path to Glory"' (evidence #14), which contains photos of every victory scene in every battle the Steel Samurai has won. This suggests Cody is likely very efficient at using his camera to capture key moments, contradicting his claim that he missed it due to the camera malfunction. Cody's inconsistencies in saying he had trouble getting the picture while having an album full of perfectly timed action shots need further investigation.

By pressing on the supposed reasons he missed taking a picture of the crucial moment, we open an avenue to highlight this inconsistency. Considering this, let's present the '"Path to Glory"' (evidence #14) against statement 5, "Th-that's all that happened. Yup" where Cody claims he missed capturing the moment.

Well, I have to say Phoenix, I'm impressed! Not everyone takes on a murder trial right off the bat like this. It says a lot about you... and your client as well.Phoenix:\nUm... thanks. Actually, it's because I owe him a favor.Mia:\nA favor? You mean, you knew the defendant before this case?Phoenix:\nYes. Actually, I kind of owe my current job to him. He's one of the reasons I became an attorney.Mia:\nWell, that's news to me!Phoenix:\nI want to help him out any way I can! I just... really want to help him. I owe him that much.???:\n(It's over! My life, everything, it's all over!)Mia:\n... Is that your client screaming over there?

The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say it was you...)Phoenix:\nMy name is Phoenix Wright. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\" In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!August 3, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.

Well, that's Larry Butz, Your Honor.Judge:\nCorrect. Just keep your wits about you and you'll do fine. Next question: This is a murder trial. Tell me, what's the victim's name?Phoenix:\n(Whew, I know this one! Glad I read the case report cover to cover so many times. It's... wait... Uh-oh! No... no way! I forgot! I'm drawing a total blank here!)Mia:\nPhoenix! Are you absolutely SURE you're up to this? You don't even know the victim's name!?Phoenix:\nOh, the victim! O-Of course I know the victim's name! I, um, just forgot. ...Temporarily (Changed from [I, um, just forgot. ... Temporarily.] in the original release)Mia:\nI think I feel a migraine coming on.

You've answered all my questions. I see no reason why we shouldn't proceed. You seem much more relaxed, Mr. Wright. Good for you.Phoenix:\nThank you, Your Honor. (Because I don't FEEL relaxed, that's for sure.)Judge:\nWell, then... First, a question for the prosecution. Mr. Payne?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nAs Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to the court just what that \"object\" was?Payne:\nThe murder weapon was this statue of \"The Thinker.\" It was found lying on the floor, next to the victim.Judge:\nI see... The court accepts it into evidence. (Changed from [I see... the court accepts it into evidence.] in the original release)Statue added to the Court Record.Mia:\nWright...

WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?Payne:\nMr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by \"dumped.\" In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!Butz:\nWhaddya mean, \"one of them\"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!Payne:\nYour Honor, the victim's passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.Passport added to the Court Record.Judge:\nHmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.Butz:\nDude... no way...Payne:\nThe victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several \"Sugar Daddies.\"Butz:\nDaddies? Sugar?Payne:\nYes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.Butz:\nDuuude!Payne:\nWe can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?Mia:\nWright... I don't think you want him to answer that question.Phoenix:\n(Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)Wait and see what happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Might be better not to get involved in this one...)\nPayne:\nWell, Mr. Butz?\nButz:\nDude, no way!

I'm just gonna drop dead!\"Butz:\nI'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I'm going to get to the bottom of this!Judge:\nLet's continue with the trial, shall we?Payne:\nI believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.Judge:\nYes, quite.Phoenix:\n(Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)Payne:\nNext question! You went to the victim's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?Butz:\nGulp!Payne:\nWell, did you, or did you not?Butz:\nHeh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn't!Phoenix:\n(Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)Have him answer honestly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I know!

Well then, we'll just have to remind you!\nPhoenix:\n(I got a bad feeling about this...)\nPayne:\nWe have a witness that can prove he DID go to the victim's apartment that day!\nLeads to:\n\"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?\"Judge:\nWell, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?Payne:\nThe man who found the victim's body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw the defendant fleeing the scene of the crime!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.Payne:\nYes, Your Honor.Phoenix:\n(This is bad...)Payne:\nOn the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim's building.

Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!)Judge:\nIncidentally, why wasn't the phone in the victim's apartment working?Payne:\nYour Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.Judge:\nAren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor...

The real deal!Phoenix:\nUh... what exactly am I supposed to do?Mia:\nWhy, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!Phoenix:\nLies! What?! He was lying!?Mia:\nYour client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?Phoenix:\n!!! How do I prove he's not?Mia:\nYou hold the key! It's in the evidence! Compare the witness's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there!

What to do

What happened







Phoenix:
Maybe you could start by telling us what happened.
Will:
Y-yes. Of course. It seems like it was only yesterday. Actually, it was only yesterday. The cast had come down to Global Studios for a run-through. We went through a few action sequences at 10:00 that morning. There was a rehearsal scheduled for 5:00 in the afternoon. But when 5:00 came around, and the staff gathered at the studio... The Evil Magistrate was found lying in a crumpled heap near the set. They took off his mask... And discovered that it was Jack Hammer... dead! He had been expertly skewered with the Samurai Spear.
Phoenix:
The "Samurai Spear"...?
Will:
Yes, it's a long spear that I... that the Steel Samurai uses as a weapon.




The Steel Samurai







Phoenix:
Maybe you could explain to me just what "the Steel Samurai" is.
Maya:
Nick! How could you say such a thing? I-I'm sorry, sir, I apologize for my partner! He's new to this, and a bit OUT OF TOUCH with the world.
Phoenix:
Hey! Who's "new to this"!?
Will:
No, it's alright, really. The Steel Samurai is the lead character in a popular kid's show. He walks the streets of Neo Olde Tokyo... Fighting battle after battle against the Evil Magistrate and his minions. Of course, he never really defeats the Evil Magistrate. Although... I guess he did defeat him this time... *sniff* Uwaaah!
Phoenix:
I-I see. (Neo Olde Tokyo...? Who comes up with these names!?)




Powers's alibi (appears after "What happened")







Phoenix:
Now, where were you on the day of the murder?
Will:
Well, that morning I came to studios at 9:00. We worked through some action scenes until noon. Rehearsal was to begin at 5:00, but I was a little tired. So after lunch, I took a nap in my dressing room. When I woke up, it was after 5:00! I was late for the rehearsal! I hurried to the studio... and found everyone looking shocked. They arrested me on the spot, and brought me here.
Phoenix:

The studios







Phoenix:
So, what do you do here at the studios?
Oldbag:
At Global Studios, we make children's dreams come true! In fact, in my younger days...
Maya:
No! You were a star!?
Oldbag:
Only a little twinkle between the stars here, I'm afraid, dearie.
Maya:
Wo... wow.
Oldbag:
This place has really gone downhill, you know? But 10 years ago, now that was a studio of dreams! Hammer was a big star back then too, he was...
Phoenix:
Hammer...?
Oldbag:
The victim, dummy! The Evil Magistrate! He's been reduced to playing villains now. Not exactly the best material to work with...




Will Powers







Phoenix:
Can you tell me about Mr. Will Powers?
Oldbag:
He's not a bad kid, but don't be fooled by his mask! You wouldn't want him on the silver screen without it, believe me. Little old ladies watching would lose their lunch! That's probably why he thought that the Steel Samurai was his "big chance." No one thought he was capable of doing what he did to poor Jack Hammer...
Maya:
We don't know for certain that Will Powers is guilty!
Oldbag:
Powers? Of course he's guilty! How do I know? I know everything! That's my job.




Mr. Hammer (appears after "The studios")







Phoenix:
What kind of person was Jack Hammer?
Oldbag:
What "kind of person"? Oh... if you only knew! Jack Hammer will live on in many hearts as the ultimate action hero! He was simply dashing in the Dynamite Samurai series!
Phoenix:
(Should I have heard of that...?)
Oldbag:
But... there was an accident during filming five years ago. He got an unlucky break after that. Reduced to playing the villain on a children's program! What's more, I heard they were paying him peanuts. It's enough to make you cry.




Reason for suspicion (appears after "Will Powers")







Phoenix:
Why are you so certain Mr. Powers is the killer?
Oldbag:
I was standing right here yesterday, I was. I was here from 1:00 in the afternoon, to 5:00, when they found the body! Now the studio where the murder took place is to the left here. So if you want to go to the studio, you have to pass by me! Only one person went by here between 1:00 and 2:30, when the murder took place!
Phoenix:
And... that person was Mr. Powers?
Oldbag:
Yes. I saw him!
Phoenix:
But Mr. Powers says he was sleeping in his dressing room.

Will:
W-what? No! I'd never do that!
Phoenix:
Just now you said that you were sleeping in your dressing room after lunch.
Will:
Yes. Like a baby.
Phoenix:
But the security lady said she saw you that day. She says she saw you heading towards the scene of the crime!
Will:
W-what!? That's not possible! I... I really don't know what to say! I was sleeping, I promise!
Phoenix:
Mr. Powers, if you want me to help you, you have to tell me the truth. I'm new to this lawyer business, and I need every advantage I can get.
Will:
I know... I-I'm sorry. *sniff* But, I swear to you on my momma's grave, I was sleeping. Maybe the security lady only thought she saw me?
Phoenix:

Will:
Oh, the security lady?

She's terrible! She called me "suspicious lookin'"!

Detective Gumshoe, what's down the path to the left? It looks like a tree fell down over the path...?
Gumshoe:
Oh, yeah. That way's kind of dangerous. You should stay out, pal. There's nothing down there, anyway. That's where Studio Two used to be, they tell me. They don't use it now, though.

The studio mascot. I guess it's a monkey of some kind. But what kind of monkey has a nose like that? He's holding a sign in his hand. [Right: To Studio One; Left: To Studio Two]

Oh, the wind was pretty strong yesterday, and the head broke off. It took that tree down with it, too.




Security camera







Phoenix:
Hey, there's a camera here.
Gumshoe:
That's the security camera. It takes photos of people going to the studio. All you have to do is look at the data and you can see who went where!
Phoenix:
There's a number plate on the camera... [ST1-307]. That must be the camera ID number.




Studio One entrance







Phoenix:
The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.
Maya:
Let's go in and check it out, Nick! ... Hey! It's locked!
Phoenix:
Looks like you need a cardkey to get in. It makes sense that they would want to keep the non-employees out.




Welcome sign







Maya:
There's a big welcome sign above the path.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, apparently the studio's fallen on tough times. They've started letting people in on days they aren't filming. They make a bit of extra money by charging for admission.
Maya:
Huh. You sure know a lot about this place, Detective. You know, you could always quit being a detective and work here?

Yeah! And what perfect timing, with the monkey's neck broken and all.

Gumshoe:
I'm not at liberty to give you any more information, pal. You'll hear all you need to know in court!
Phoenix:
(Oh well, it was worth a try.)




Reason for arrest







Phoenix:
Why was Mr. Powers arrested?
Gumshoe:
Simple, pal! The murder took place right over there in Studio One. Now, the victim entered Studio One at approximately 1:00 PM. At that time, there was no one other than the victim in the studio. According to the autopsy report, the time of death was 2:30 PM. Only one person went to the studio between 1:00 and 2:30! And that person was none other than Will Powers! No one else, pal! If you think I'm lying, ask the security lady at the main gate.
Maya:
Nick! If that's true...! Anyone would think that Powers did it with that kind of evidence!
Phoenix:
Thanks for cheering me up...




The security lady







Phoenix:
About the security lady...
Gumshoe:
Oh, that sweet old lady. What a charmer!
Phoenix:
Huh? A-are we talking about the same person?
Gumshoe:
When I showed her my badge she gave me a donut and some coffee!

Decisive evidence (appears after "The security lady")

Gumshoe:
Well, that, er, photo. The photo of the Steel Samurai heading toward the scene of the crime!

What! Who took that!?

Maybe it should just be a big "L" for "Lawyer"?

Photographic proof







Phoenix:
Why didn't you tell us about the security photo, ma'am?
Oldbag:
Hmm? Oh, that? I just thought it would be more thrilling to talk with the detective himself! These things are important, you know. Oh, just to the left from here is the gate with the camera that took that photo. It's my job to check the photos every day, you see.




Reason for suspicion







Oldbag:
This guard station is in a central position. No matter where you go here, you pass by my station first! Now poor Hammer, he went to the studio just before 1:00. The murder happened right around 2:30, see? The only one I seen go through here between 1:00 and 2:30 was Powers himself! The security camera got a good look at him too. If he's not the one what did it, I don't know who is!
Phoenix:
Maybe... it was you?
Oldbag:
Gyah hah ha hah! Good one, sonny.
Phoenix:
(She thinks I was joking.)




Mr. Hammer







Phoenix:
Was the victim, Mr. Hammer, a popular actor?
Oldbag:
Oh, he was the biggest star in the studio!
Phoenix:
("Was"? Past tense?)
Maya:
Oh yes! He was great as the "Bearded Samurai"!
Oldbag:
That too, yes. He shone the brightest! Back in the day. Making a star like him play the "Evil Magistrate"... It's a disgrace, I tell you! Hammer took it pretty hard, and who can blame him?




Automatic camera (appears after "Photographic proof")







Phoenix:
About the security camera...
Oldbag:
Oh yes, the camera. It's automatic. It can tell when someone walks through that gate, see? Then it snaps a photo! Apparently, it records the time when it takes a picture too. But I don't bother myself with those details. I just view all the photos on the computer over in the security guard station. I check 'em every day before going home, I do.October 16Wright & Co.

What to do

What do you think?
Maya:
That photo the detective was talking about is the problem here.
Phoenix:
Well, that's hard to say, without seeing the actual photo ourselves. But if it is Powers in that photo, his alibi is shot.




Photographic proof







Phoenix:
Only one person went to the scene of the crime before the murder took place. And there's a photograph to prove it.
Maya:
I guess it makes sense that that person is the killer then. What do we do, Nick?

Maybe there was someone else who could have gone to the scene other than Powers? Let's take a look. Maybe that security lady missed someone?

Drain grate







Phoenix:
The metal grate on the drain here has been taken off. That's a pretty big drain. A kid could fit through there, I bet.
Maya:
Yeah, if you snuck in that way you wouldn't have to pay at the gate!
Phoenix:
Well, if you want to leave that way, be my guest.

Bag (subsequent times)







Maya:
I wonder what else is inside Powers's bag...?
Phoenix:
Stop that! (My partner, the thief in training.)




Table







Phoenix:
There's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Some tea and cookies...
Maya:
Nick... I'm hungry!
Phoenix:
You just had a burger!
Maya:
Yeah, but I have a separate stomach for sweets!
Phoenix:
(How many stomachs does this girl have!?)




Window







Phoenix:
It's locked. Looks like he doesn't open his window much. I guess it is kind of dusty outside.Wright & Co. Law OfficesPresent









Cardkey







Maya:
Oh, hey! That's the cardkey to get into Studio One where the murder took place! Let's go check it out!Studio - Main GatePresent









Cardkey







Phoenix:
Could you tell me about this, ma'am?
Oldbag:
Oh that! Isn't that a studio cardkey? You better watch it! The scene of a murder is no place for sightseeing! I'll be taking that! Hand it over!
Phoenix:
W-wait! No, that's mine!
Oldbag:
Look, I don't have a cardkey to the studio, see? I want to go pay my respects to Jack Hammer where he died.
Phoenix:
W... well you'll just have to wait!Outside Studio OneExamine









Studio One entrance







Phoenix:
The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.
Maya:
Let's go in and check it out, Nick!
Phoenix:
I wonder if this cardkey we borrowed from the dressing room will work...

*beep*

Phoenix:
It opened!
Maya:
Alright! We're in!
Phoenix:
(She's way too happy for someone visiting a crime scene.)Present









Cardkey







Maya:
Hey, Detective! Take a look at this!
Gumshoe:
Whazzat?
Phoenix:
Whoa whoa whoa! Don't show him that! He'll confiscate it!
Maya:
Aww... I just wanted to show it off.After examining Studio One entrance in Studio One Entrance:October 16Studio OneMaya:

What is it?Maya:
...Phoenix:
You're real quiet all of a sudden.Maya:
Doesn't it give you the shivers, Nick? That white tape! It's so... so real!Phoenix:
Well, the Evil Magistrate did die here. And the Steel Samurai killed him. The murder weapon was the Samurai Spear. Sounds pretty real to me...Examine









Director's chair







Maya:
Hey! Look! That's the chair the director sits in! I've always wanted to sit in one of these. Hey Nick, take a look at that. One of those black-and-white boards they clap at the start of filming! And look! A megaphone! A real live megaphone!
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
Ready, Nick? Action!
Phoenix:
(This girl is more troubled than I thought...)




Film camera







Leads to:
"Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!"




Reflecting screen







Maya:
What's this?
Phoenix:
That's for reflecting light. They call it a reflecting screen or something like that. The assistant holds it during filming.
Maya:
Huh.
Phoenix:
What? Where's your enthusiasm for all things entertainment?
Maya:
Well, lighting is fine, but I'd want to be the director. Or maybe the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
(I think she's being serious...!)




Stage backdrop







Phoenix:
Looks like a backdrop for a stage. This must be used in the Steel Samurai show.
Maya:
Of course! That's the mountain, Neo Fujiyama!
Phoenix:
Doesn't the Steel Samurai take place in Olde Tokyo? Can you even see Mt. Fuji from there?
Maya:
Not Olde Tokyo, Nick! "Neo" Olde Tokyo!
Phoenix:
Oh. Right.




(Step)ladder







Maya:
Look, a ladder!
Phoenix:
That's a "step"-ladder.
Maya:
So? What's the difference? You need to stop judging things based on narrow-minded cultural assumptions, Nick!
Phoenix:
R-right... sorry. (This girl is OUT there!)




Tape outline







Phoenix:
They outlined where Jack Hammer's body lay with tape. His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. I guess that's why the head part looks like a helmet. Funny, I expected a spear stabbing would leave at least a few bloodstains. I guess the costume must have absorbed most of it...Maya:
Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!Phoenix:
Yeah! So don't touch it!Maya:
Whoa! It's heavier than I thought...???:
Hey! You! No touching that!Phoenix:
Ah, um, sorry, my partner is kind of, y'know...Maya:
"Y'know"!? No I don't know!Phoenix:
Umm... who are you?Penny:
Who me? I'm an assistant here. I help with props and stuff. Moving them around, ordering new ones, et cetera.Maya:
We're lawyers representing Mr. Will Powers.Penny:
Oh, you're WP's people.Maya:
"WP"...? Oh, Will Powers. W.P., I get it.Penny:
I don't envy you guys one bit! But... do what you can for WP, okay? He'd never hurt a fly! He has to be innocent.Maya:
Don't worry, leave it to us!Talk









The day of the crime







Phoenix:
Could you tell me anything about the day of the murder?
Penny:
Yes. I was in the studio the whole day. I was the only assistant on staff that day, you see.
Maya:
Only one assistant!?
Penny:
Yes, well, the studios isn't doing so well right now. (Changed from [Yes, well, the studios aren't doing so well right now.] in the original release) And yesterday was only rehearsal for our action sequences.
Maya:
Oh, I see. (Changed from [I see. Neat!] in the original release)
Penny:
In the morning we went through the action sequences in the employee area. WP and Hammer were there, along with everyone else.
Phoenix:
The employee area--that's where Powers's dressing room is, right?
Penny:
Yes, that's the place. After eating lunch there, Mr. Hammer went to Studio One. Then I saw WP go into his dressing room. But I didn't see either of them after that.




Will Powers







Phoenix:
Did you know that Mr. Powers was sleeping in his room?
Penny:
No! I wouldn't go in there unless I had some urgent message for him... I mean, it's his private... What kind of a girl do you think I am!?
Phoenix:
W-what kind...? No, no, I'm sure you're a fine girl. Um, sorry. (So much for getting a confirmation of Powers's alibi.)Present









Anything







Phoenix:
Um, any thoughts about this?
Penny:
Sorry... I... don't really want to think too much about what happened just yet.After clearing all Talk options:Maya:
What do we do, Nick? We haven't found anything. If WP was the only one who came to the studio... Then he has to be the killer! They even have a photograph...Phoenix:
Hmm...Penny:
Umm... Sorry... I know you're busy.Phoenix:
Not really.Penny:
Actually, there's been something bothering me.Maya:
Ah hah! That's what I'm talking about! A clue! A lead!Penny:
Well, I don't know about that, but that day, just after noon, I sensed someone was here...Phoenix:
You "sensed"?Penny:
Yes, several times.Phoenix:
Some other studio employees, maybe?Penny:
No, I don't think so. The only thing we had scheduled was an action scene run-through. I was the only assistant here that day. I have a feeling it was someone from... outside.Phoenix:
R-really!?Maya:
But wait, if someone had come in here... Wouldn't that security lady have noticed them?Phoenix:
Yeah, you're right.Penny:
I'm sorry I don't have any better information than that.Maya:
No, thanks! That helps us a lot. Anything helps. Let's go put that security lady on the spot!Talk









Sensing someone







Phoenix:
So you sensed that someone other than the regular film crew was in the studio?
Penny:
Yes... I think.
Phoenix:
("I think" doesn't cut it in a witness testimony.)
Maya:
Nick! What about that security lady! If someone else came into the studio, she must have seen them!October 16Global StudiosMain GateOldbag:
What? You're still here? Really! You look as though you've seen a ghost!Talk









Assistant's claim







Leads to:
"What? I saw that suspicious look on your face!"Oldbag:
What? I saw that suspicious look on your face!Phoenix:
I wanted to ask you again about yesterday... You came here at 1:00 PM, correct? And the estimated time of Hammer's death was 2:30. Are you sure that Powers was the only one to go through here between those times?Oldbag:
Sure as can be!Maya:
But we have a witness who thinks there was "someone from outside" here that day.Oldbag:
What!?Maya:
Are you absolutely sure you were here watching the whole time?Oldbag:
...Maya:
Ma'am?Oldbag:
Who was it? Who told you that? Who dares question ME!?Maya:
Eek!Oldbag:
Alright you better tell me and tell me quick, you spiky-haired cretin! Someone's been complaining about the work I do, eh!?Maya:
Uh... um, we were just talking to the assistant in Studio One.Oldbag:
Her! She's not even a full-time employee! All you young'uns are like that nowadays, running your mouths like there was no tomorrow saying this that and the other thing. Well when I was young let me tell you we knew a thing or two about respecting our elders. Back then we did and it's a crying shame that you youths today just say what you please about poor old ladies Graaaaaaaaaaaawr!Phoenix:
She left...Maya:
Well, Nick? This is our chance to do what we can without her looking over our shoulders!Examine









Computer







Phoenix:
The computer that runs the studio security cameras.
Maya:
Nick! Maybe we can see that photo of Powers with this computer!
Phoenix:
Yeah, maybe. (Should I try the computer?)



Try it







Phoenix:
Okay. Let's give it a try.
Maya:
You know how to work these things, Nick?
Phoenix:
Looks like I just have to enter in a few numbers. Let's see... first, I need the date of the murder. (It looks like the camera turned on at 1:00 PM that day... 1:00... That was when the security lady arrived at the guard station.)
[Please enter the number of the security camera.]



ST1-703







Phoenix:
There! Entered!
Maya:
... ... Nothing happened.
Phoenix:
Huh? Maybe I got the number wrong.
Maya:

What? You're not going to look at it? Bo-ring!

There! Entered! ...Maya:
Hey! It printed out the data for that day!Phoenix:
Let's see what we got... ... Huh?Maya:
How is this a picture of Will Powers?Phoenix:
Well, he is the one who always wears that suit... I guess that's why the security lady thought it was him.Maya:
I don't imagine the detective was very happy with this photo as evidence. Hmm? Something's printed on the back.Phoenix:
Huh? [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2]Maya:
What does that mean?Phoenix:
Maybe there's more photo data from that day?Maya:
Nope--that's the only one in the computer.Powers's{?} Photo added to the Court Record.Maya:
Hey, hey, Nick! Can't we use this photo as evidence for the trial?Phoenix:
Yeah.Maya:
We'll put that security lady in her place with this!Phoenix:
Right, we'll put her in her place...Maya:
Hey, that's what I said! Anyway... Let's show her this photo and see what she says!Phoenix:
Wait. Let's not.Maya:
Why not?Phoenix:
It's never a good idea to reveal your hand to the enemy too soon.Maya:
Nick! You're craftier than I gave you credit for. Why, you could be the next... Evil Magistrate!Phoenix:
Hey! Why do I have to be the villain.Maya:
Relax, it was just a joke! So, are we done for today?Phoenix:
I think this photo is what we needed for the trial. Still, it'd be better if we had some idea who the real killer was! Maybe it really is that security lady...?To be continued.Before selecting "ST1-307" upon examining computer in Global Studios - Main Gate:October 16Studio OneMaya:

Part 6October 18, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:
Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth:
The prosecution will show the court that at 2:30 PM on October 15, the defendant, Mr. Will Powers, killed fellow actor Jack Hammer at Studio One of Global Studios. It is impossible for anyone else to have committed this heinous crime. The evidence presented during the trial will all point to this fact.Judge:
Hmm. I see. Very well, I would like to move on to your testimony. Mr. Edgeworth, the prosecution may call its first witness.Edgeworth:
Very well, I call a most familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand. (Changed from [First, I would like to call a familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand.] in the original release)Edgeworth:
Detective, if you would briefly describe this case to the court?Gumshoe:
Yes sir! I'll explain with the guidemap here. To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see? This here is the Employee Area. The actors did a run-through of their action scenes during the morning here. This is the main gate to the studios. The security lady that works at the studios was here at 1:00 PM on that day. Past the security station there is a gate, see? Past that are the studios. And here it is... Studio One. This is the scene of the murder, where the body was found! Now, on the day of the murder, October 15, there were only three people here. The victim, Jack Hammer, the defendant, Will Powers, and a young woman, the production assistant. All the production staff were in the Employee Area until noon. Then after lunch, the victim, Jack Hammer, went to Studio One. Right after that, at 1:00 PM, the security lady got to the guard station. Now, jump ahead to later that day... 5:00 PM. The production staff came to Studio One to perform a rehearsal. Needless to say, the rehearsal was cancelled... The time of death was 2:30 PM. The "Samurai Spear" found lodged in the victim's chest was the murder weapon. That's the case, in brief. Anyone like to hear that again?Phoenix:
(Hmm... should I listen to that whole thing again...?)Skip it







Leads to:
"I think I can probably remember that..."Listen again







Phoenix:
I'm sorry, could you describe that one more time?
Gumshoe:
I shoulda known it would be you, pal! Fine. Once more for the mentally-challenged lawyer.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, yeah. Live it up while you can, Gumshoe.)
Leads back to:
"To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see?"Phoenix:
(I think I can probably remember that...)Judge:
So the murder weapon was a "spear"? How... medieval!Samurai Spear added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:
Your Honor. This case is quite simple if you ask one question: And that question is: "What did the security lady at the guard station see?"Judge:
Understood.Edgeworth:
Let's call this security officer to the stand!Edgeworth:
Will the witness declare her name?Oldbag:
... Hmm? My, aren't you a handsome fellow! I'm afraid I'm a bit flustered!Edgeworth:
Y-your name, please!Oldbag:
Oh, dearie! No need for you to be embarrassed! Just call me "grandma."Edgeworth:
YOUR NAME, PLEASE!Phoenix:
(Seems Edgeworth has a bit of trouble getting his witnesses to say their names...)Oldbag:
Wendy Oldbag, dearie. So just call me "grandma." It's practically my name! So even when I was young I was an Oldbag, but not really that was just my name dearie. Still how the other children would make fun of me and just because of my name can you believe it? But there was this boy, the captain of the chess club in junior high, and when he called me an old bag well I just cried and cried because I had a crush on him you see--Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
O-objection! I... object to the witness's talkativeness.Judge:
Objection sustained! The witness will refrain from rambling on the stand.Oldbag:
I was just getting to the good part, dearie!Edgeworth:
Perhaps we can get to the testimony?Judge:
Now, the witness was stationed at the main gate on the day of the murder, correct?Oldbag:
Yessey I was.Judge:
And to get to the scene of the murder, someone would have to pass by you?Oldbag:
You know your stuff, dearie!Judge:
... You may begin your testimony.Phoenix:
(She sure is one hell of an Oldbag...)Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Oldbag:
On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.
Poor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.
I, well, I had some errands to run that morning.
Anyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.
I was at the main gate from then until 5:00!
Now, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?
Interesting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.
It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!Judge:
You saw the defendant, then? Hmm... Very well. Let's begin the cross-examination. Mr. Wright?Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.Cross Examination-- Witness's Account --Oldbag:
On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So up until that time, anyone who wanted to could go into the studio?
Oldbag:
Well, there wasn't a security guard at the gate, no. But the main gate was locked, dearie. You'd need an employee cardkey to get in.
Phoenix:
(Right... the cardkey that I have. So, what she's saying is no one who wasn't supposed to be there could get in.)
Edgeworth:
Was there anyone at the studios when you arrived at the guard station?Oldbag:
Poor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
A "run-through"...?
Oldbag:
They were working out a scene between the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate. They got the basics figured out by noon, and were to use the afternoon for practice. Rehearsal was supposed to start at 5:00. That's why poor old Hammer went to Studio One in the afternoon.
Phoenix:
(So Powers was in his dressing room sleeping... when he was supposed to be practicing! Talk about a laid-back hero...)
Edgeworth:
If there was a run-through in the morning, why did you only get there after noon?Oldbag:
I, well, I had some errands to run that morning.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What kind of "errands"?
Oldbag:
Oh, well, you know.
Phoenix:
Answer the question!
Oldbag:
Actually... I was watching poor Hammer and Powers. Observing, you know?
Phoenix:
O-observing? Weren't you supposed to be at the guard station?
Oldbag:
Whippersnapper! I told you I locked the gate, didn't I? I did my job!
Phoenix:
(I'm not sure your boss would see it that way...)
Oldbag:
Anyway! I always watch Hammer's run-throughts. Always! Never missed one in all my years.
Maya:
Wow! I want to see a Steel Samurai run-through too!
Phoenix:
You could quit being a spirit medium and take up guard duty.
Maya:
Not a bad idea...Oldbag:
Anyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Did you see the victim then?
Oldbag:
Did I see poor old Hammer? Nope. He'd already gone to the studio before I got back to the guard station.
Edgeworth:
Tell us what happened next.Oldbag:
I was at the main gate from then until 5:00!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So you were watching there the WHOLE time? No breaks? Not even a second?
Oldbag:
O-of course! I am a professional, you know! Our are you criticizing how I do my job!? Whippersnapper!
Phoenix:
No, it's just, after seeing you eating those donuts in the guard station yesterday...
Oldbag:
I can watch the gate and eat donuts at the same time! Snipperwhapper!
Maya:
"Snipperwhapper"...? Old windbag is losing it, Nick.
Phoenix:
Why don't you raise an objection?
Judge:
So, the witness was on duty through the afternoon, the whole time. Very well. What did you see?Oldbag:
Now, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
How did you know that?
Oldbag:
Oh hoh hoh. I have my ways! That over-dressed young detective told me. I fed him some donuts and he talked and talked... If you ask me, that detective isn't cut out for his job.
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
(Poor Detective Gumshoe, getting chewed out by a security guard...)Oldbag:
Interesting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
2:00? You're sure?
Oldbag:
Sure as spit!
Judge:
Well, who was the man!?

Really, you should try not to get so excited at your age. You might strain something.

Windbags love gossiping about other people's misfortunes.Maya:
Ugh. Can't she get her kicks somewhere else?Phoenix:
Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag! You've been saying since yesterday that you "saw Mr. Powers," correct? But you're talking about the man in this photo, aren't you!Judge:
J-just a moment, Mr. Wright. Let me see that photo! ... What is this, exactly?Phoenix:
None other than the Steel Samurai, defender of Neo Olde Tokyo. Ms. Oldbag! Is this the "Mr. Powers" that you saw!?Oldbag:
Of course! Didn't your momma teach you any sense, sonny? Anyone can plainly see that's Powers! Right?Edgeworth:
No, they can't! (Changed from [Um, yeah.] in the original release) ... Umm... well. I mean, I wonder? (Changed from [Umm... well. I wonder?] in the original release)Phoenix:
True, Mr. Powers does play the role of the Steel Samurai! But that doesn't mean Mr. Powers IS the Steel Samurai!Oldbag:
...! I... I know that! I wasn't born yesterday!Judge:
No one in this court is accusing you of that, Ms... er, witness.Phoenix:
(He's having trouble calling her "Oldbag" apparently...)Judge:
However, you do not have proof that the person in this photo is Mr. Will Powers, do you?Oldbag:
Humph! Nosy old man! Of course I have proof!Phoenix:
What!?Edgeworth:
Huh!?Phoenix:
(Even Edgeworth is surprised!?)Edgeworth:
The prosecution would like to ask the old... the witness. Please make known all the information in your possession ahead of time!Oldbag:
How was I to know everyone would be so nosy! You should be ashamed, all of you! Anyway, I showed that photo to the young detective. He told me "this isn't any good as evidence, pal." He didn't even give it a second look!Edgeworth:
...Phoenix:
(Wow, old windbag has left even Edgeworth speechless. She's good!)Judge:
Let's hear about your proof, then.Witness Testimony-- The Man in the Photo --Oldbag:
I never say anything I don't mean, mind you!
That morning, during the run-through of the action scene...
I saw Powers trip and fall!
He broke one of the props, it was a big mess.
Apparently, he sprained his ankle pretty bad.
Now, look at that picture!
You can see he's dragging his leg! See? Clear as day!
That's how I knew it was Powers. Happy?Judge:
Hmm. So he had sprained his ankle...? Very well. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Phoenix:

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Who was present at the run-through?
Oldbag:
Well, let's see... There was Powers, he's the Steel Samurai... Then poor old Hammer, the Evil Magistrate. And... me.
Judge:
And what exactly were you doing?
Oldbag:
Observing! Just... observing.
Phoenix:
What about the assistant?
Oldbag:
Oh, she was off moving backdrops around and such.
Phoenix:

I saw Powers trip and fall!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
"Trip and fall"...?
Oldbag:
Yes! And to think, he's supposed to be the Steel Samurai! What a laugh! So Powers sprained his ankle. I helped make it better for him, of course.
Judge:
You... helped make it better?
Oldbag:
I kissed it where it hurt.
Judge:
L-let's just skip over that part, shall we?
Phoenix:
Where was the assistant then?
Oldbag:
Oh, her? She was cleaning up backdrops, I think. She didn't know about Powers's ankle.
Phoenix:
(Hmm...)
Edgeworth:
You may continue your testimony.Oldbag:
He broke one of the props, it was a big mess.Press







Phoenix:

He broke a prop?

Sure did! His own Samurai Spear.

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Still, you can't look at this and say it's Mr. Powers!

Phoenix:

Umm... hmm. Actually, well... We couldn't find it. We're looking, though.Judge:
Hmm...Edgeworth:
Anyway, that's not important! The witness did see the Steel Samurai, yes. And it is clear that the person in the Steel Samurai suit was Mr. Will Powers!Judge:
Hmm... I suppose that's right.Phoenix:
(Are you sure you're sure, Your Honor?)Object







Phoenix:
Hold it right there! We keep talking possibilities, but we have to agree that this photo shows the Steel Samurai! Nowhere in this photo can we see Mr. Will Powers!
Judge:
Hmm... The defense has a point. I also wonder if someone else not caught on camera could have killed Mr. Hammer. We have to consider that possibility, also.
Edgeworth:
Then allow me to remove that doubt from your mind, Your Honor...
Leads to:
"Will the witness continue her testimony, please?"Wait and see what happens







Phoenix:
(I think I'll wait and see where this goes.)
Judge:
I suppose, since there weren't any additional crew members at the studios that day... It's quite likely that it was the defendant inside that costume. I see no problem with this evidence.
Edgeworth:
Most perceptive, Your Honor!

Hold on! Look at this photograph one more time. This photo was taken by the camera at the gate for the studios, correct?Oldbag:
Yesiree, sonny.Phoenix:
So, whenever anyone passes by here, it automatically takes a picture?Oldbag:
And here I thought you didn't know your head from a hole in the ground.Phoenix:
Right... Anyway! It's also true that the computer in the guard station records all security cam data.Oldbag:
Ooh! You know, if you wanted to work at the studio, we might have an opening.Phoenix:
That very computer printed out this photo. Note that on the back of the photo are printed the words: [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2]Oldbag:
Even I know that means it was taken at 2:00 PM on October the 15th! Really, sonny!Phoenix:
Actually, I knew that too. The issure here is the bit at the end where it says: "Photo #2"...Oldbag:
"Photo #2"...?Phoenix:
The computer only held data for one photo on that day. Don't you think that's odd? Shouldn't this photo be "Photo #1" if it really was the ONLY photo!?Judge:
Order! Order! Please tell the court what you mean by this, Mr. Wright!Phoenix:
Actually, that's what I want to ask the witness. This evidence shows that not one, but two people went to the studio that day. Yet there is only data for one of the photos! Who could have erased the data for the other photo? Only someone with access-- the security lady herself! (Changed from [Only someone with access... the security lady herself!] in the original release)Oldbag:
Eh!? You watch your mouth, whippersnapper! The only person I saw that day was Will Powers!Phoenix:
But the camera on the gate fired twice! That means two people went by!Oldbag:

Well, who in the heck was in that photo you erased!?Oldbag:
Humph. A fanboy.Phoenix:
F-fanboy?Oldbag:
Steel Samurai fanboys. Real freaks, if you ask me. They get information about the rehearsals from gosh-knows-where. They're always hanging about. One was there that day.Phoenix:Phoenix:
W-wait a second! Didn't you just say no one else could get in!? "I locked the main gate so no one could get in"... Those were your words!Oldbag:
Well! If you must know, there's a drain that goes into the Employee Area. The grate has been loose for a while. It leads outside, and well, that's where they come in.Phoenix:
They come in through the drain?Oldbag:
I told you they were freaks. Oh, and...Phoenix:
And...?Oldbag:
They're kids. Children. Whippersnappers.Phoenix:
K-kids!? So, on the photo that you erased...?Oldbag:
It was a boy. Probably 2nd or 3rd grade.Phoenix:
Whaaaaaaaaaaaat!?Judge:
O-order! Order! Let me get this straight. You saw two people pass by the gate on their way to the studios that day? One was the Steel Samurai, dragging his leg. The other was a boy who looked to be in about 2nd or 3rd grade?Oldbag:
Oh yes, well we see his type there every day. Can't stop 'em. Can't catch 'em.Edgeworth:
A boy in 2nd or 3rd grade? Hmm... I assume it would be hard, if not impossible for a young boy to wield the Samurai Spear?Judge:
Impossible, I'd think. It's quite heavy.Oldbag:
Right! As I said, I didn't pay him much mind. That's why I erased the data.Maya:
Um, Nick? What's going on? I mean, the boy was there, that makes him a suspect!Phoenix:
Yeah, and they're already trying to "un-suspect" him.Judge:
This court will take a five-minute recess. (Changed from [I'd like to take a five minute recess.] in the original release) I want the defense and the prosecution to consider this new information...

I-I didn't go to the studio! I was s-sleeping, honest.Maya:
So who was the "Steel Samurai" in that security photo?Will:
How should I know? The Steel Samurai costume was off in the corner of the dressing room. Anyone could have walked in and taken it, really.Maya:

Court will now reconvene for the trial of Mr. Will Powers. (Changed from [The court will now reconvene for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.] in the original release) Mr. Edgeworth, will you present the prosecution's thoughts on this matter?Edgeworth:
The prosecution's thoughts are simple. Nothing has changed. The other person who went to the studios was a boy of roughly 10 years of age. The photo we do have may not be hard evidence... But there is still no one else that could have committed this crime! I call for a verdict of "guilty" for the defendant, Mr. Will Powers!Judge:
Hmm... Very well. Mr. Wright, your thoughts?Phoenix:
The defense disagrees with the prosecution's claim. There IS another person who could have committed this crime!Judge:
Order! Interesting... Let us hear who you have in mind! However... Be aware that this court does not look kindly on accusing the innocent. If you accuse someone who is obviously innocent, you will be penalized.Phoenix:
(Right. Great. As if the stakes weren't high enough.)Judge:
So, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder?The assistant girl







Phoenix:
It was the assistant! The Steel Samurai costume was in his dressing room. She stole it, and in doing so she became the Steel Samurai!
Judge:
So you're saying the Steel Samurai in the picture is really the assistant?
Phoenix:
That's correct, Your Honor!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
If you're serious, you've got guts, Mr. Wright. Remember the photo? Wasn't the Steel Samurai a little lame!? He was dragging his foot!
Phoenix:
Oh. (Uh oh. Bad feeling time.)
Edgeworth:
Remember the testimony concerning Powers's injury!!!


Oldbag:
Powers and poor Hammer were at the run-through. Oh, and me.
Phoenix:
What about the assistant?
Oldbag:
Oh, her? She was cleaning up backdrops, I think. She didn't know about Powers's ankle.


Edgeworth:
The assistant knew nothing of Mr. Power's injury! She could look the Steel Samurai look with that costume... But she couldn't walk the the Steel Samurai walk! She wouldn't have limped!
Phoenix:
Ungh!
Maya:
That kind of takes the legs out from under that case...
Judge:
Mr. Wright. I'm afraid I have to penalize you, as I warned.

Very well. Go ahead.

"So, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder?"The grade-school boy







Phoenix:
It was the grade-school boy! ... ... ... Why isn't anyone saying anything?
Edgeworth:
Bah! Are you seriously suggesting the boy did it, Mr. Wright!? "Grade-school boy kills veteran action star with spear!" For one thing, it was the Steel Samurai holding the murder weapon. Would you care to explain just how the boy was involved?
Phoenix:
(Hmm... maybe that was a dumb move on my part.)
Maya:
"Maybe"? "Maybe"!? How about "absolutely," Nick!

It was the security lady! Wendy Oldbag!Oldbag:
W-who!?Phoenix:
The Steel Samurai is dragging his leg in this picture. That means whoever was in the suit knew about that morning's injury. Maybe because... they had been watching the action scene run-through! There was only one person other than Powers and Hammer who knew about the injury. The security lady, Oldbag!Oldbag:
W-what!? Whippersnapper!Judge:
Order! Order! I-is this true, Oldbag!?Oldbag:
Oldbag!? That's Ms. Oldbag to you!Phoenix:
Ms. Oldbag was standing guard alone at the main gate. She was by herself... in other words, she has no alibi! She could have briefly left her post to steal the the Steel Samurai costume... Then slipped into Studio One, the scene of the murder!Judge:
W-why would she go through the trouble of wearing the Steel Samurai costume!?Phoenix:
Simple, Your Honor. She knew the camera at the gate would take her picture. If she was in his costume, she could point the finger at Mr. Powers!Judge:
I see! Excellent deductive reasoning, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:
(Ohhh yeah, right here! Sherlock Holmes II, baby!) ...? (That's odd. Isn't this the part where Edgeworth pounces...? Doesn't he usually jump up with an objection and some new damning evidence...?)Judge:
Well, Mr. Edgeworth? Does the prosecution have an opinion on this matter?Edgeworth:

W-w-what!? What's that supposed to mean!? Oh, so you all think I did it? Is that it!? Edgey-boy! Don't just sit there, do something!Phoenix:

Phoenix:
(I guess this does kind of make it look like she's the killer. Funny, I feel bad for her all of a sudden.)

Hmm... It's true that the witness could conceivably have committed this crime. Yet we must not forget that the victim was an action hero. As formidable as her personality may be, I doubt she'd be strong enough.

The very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case... can be used to cast doubt on Ms. Oldbag's actions on that day!Oldbag:

You forget that Mr. Powers lacks a clear motive, too.Judge:
Hmm... Indeed.Phoenix:
(That did it. Now windbag is one of the suspects. No hard feelings... I hope.)Oldbag:
Wait just a minute! What about the other person who went to the studio!? The boy! The one whose photo I erased!Judge:
He's only a grade schooler though, as you said. 2nd or 3rd grade, was it?Oldbag:
Th-that doesn't matter! When I was that age, I could pin my old man in 10 seconds, tops!Judge:
Hmm... Your thoughts, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:
That boy is not the killer.Oldbag:
What!? How can you be so sure! Oh, or is it be nice to the kids and mean to your elders day? Whippersnapper!Phoenix:
I have proof.Oldbag:
P-proof!?Judge:
Indeed? Then let's see this proof, Mr. Wright. You have proof that shows the boy could not have committed this murder?Present Cardkey

Yeah, them.Maya:
Well, what are we doing here then!? Let's get to the studios!Talk









What to do







Phoenix:
What do you think we should do?
Maya:
W-what do I... huh!? Why don't we do what you just said!? We gotta get the scoop on this director and producer.
Phoenix:
Oh, right. Then there's no point hanging out here.
Maya:
That's what I've been saying! Let's get to those studios pronto!




Any ideas







Maya:
Hmm. We don't have enough information to make a case yet.
Phoenix:
That's exactly the same thing you said yesterday! Just admit it: you don't have a clue what happened.
Maya:
There's not enough information!Present









Attorney's Badge







Phoenix:
Hey, see this?
Maya:
You... really like showing that off, don't you, Nick?




Cardkey







Maya:
Hey, you still have that! Great!
Phoenix:
Well, we couldn't get into the scene of the murder without it. And its owner isn't missing it in his detention cell...
Maya:
Poor old WP...




Powers's(?) Photo







Maya:
You know, what if this really was Mr. Powers?
Phoenix:
Yeah. It's hard to say. We don't really know anyone else it could be. I seriously doubt it was that old windbag.
Maya:
So Mr. Powers is... lying?
Phoenix:
He really doesn't seem the type, does he. (Curiouser and curiouser...)




Samurai Spear







Maya:
I wish I had my own Samurai Spear! You'd by my own personal pincushion, Nick!
Phoenix:
Me!? Why me!?




Anything else







Maya:
Sorry, I don't know how that will help us figure this out.October 18Detention CenterVisitor's RoomWill:
Oh, Mr. Wright! Thank you for earlier.Phoenix:
Not at all. We got lucky, to tell the truth.Maya:
You can say that again!Phoenix:
Let's not.Maya:
So, WP! Do you have any leads that might get us going in the right direction?Will:
Hmm... S-sorry, but no.Maya:
Be sure to tell us anything that comes to mind, no matter how small.Phoenix:
We can't rely on getting lucky again tomorrow.Will:
Y-yes... *sniff*Examine









Security guard







Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room.Talk









The fanboy







Phoenix:
Do, er, "fanboys" sneak into the studios often?
Will:
No, not that I know of. That security lady's pretty strict with them.
Maya:
But, in today's testimony, didn't she say they were often hanging around?
Will:
The kids really, really love the Steel Samurai. They sneak past when she's not looking, I guess.




The director







Phoenix:
Was the director present at the morning run-through?
Will:
Y-yes, yes he was. He was directing how the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate should move.
Maya:
Why didn't you tell us that before!?
Will:
W-well, just, the studio asked us to keep quiet...
Maya:
That has nothing to do with this! I hate to repeat myself, but Nick here is a newbie lawyer! Fresh off the bar! When he loses, he's going to lose big!
Will:
I... I see. *sniff*
Phoenix:
(Whose side is she on!?)
Maya:
You aren't hiding anything else from us, are you!?
Will:
N-no, I sure hope not.Present









Cardkey







Phoenix:
We found this cardkey in your dressing room.
Will:
Oh, that's mine, yes.
Maya:
Can people outside the studios get these cards?
Will:
I don't think so. Even I have to return the card. Once the show's done filming, that is.
Maya:
Huh...




Powers's(?) Photo







Phoenix:
Regarding this photograph...
Will:
Y-yes...?
Phoenix:
This really, truly, absolutely isn't you, right?
Will:
R-right. *sniff* I was sleeping in my dressing room the whole time, honest.
Phoenix:
But who else could have worn it!?
Maya:
Your costume was in your dressing room?
Will:
Yes. I guess they snuck in and took it while I was asleep.
Phoenix:
(But who!?)




Samurai Spear







Phoenix:
Regarding the murder weapon...
Will:
Yes?
Phoenix:
Is it heavy, that spear?
Will:
It's pretty hefty, yeah. I don't think the average person would be able to swing it around effectively.
Phoenix:
Hmm...
Maya:
And... that's the spear that broke or something during the morning run-through?
Will:
Oh yes, I goofed on a round kick, you see... I broke the spear. The security lady fixed it for me right away though.
Maya:
With duct tape. We heard.




Anything else







Will:
E-excuse me. Thank you for showing me that, whatever it is. I wish I could think of some way I could help you... S-sorry. *sniff*October 18, 2:16 PMGlobal StudiosMain GateMaya:
No one's here.Phoenix:
Right, now that they have Ms. Oldbag in custody. I guess they don't have anyone else to replace her...Maya:
H-hey! In the guard station! Look! She left her donuts! ... ... What? I wasn't going to eat them!Examine









Computer







Phoenix:
The computer that runs the studio security cameras. Huh? It looks like it's been turned off for the day.




Guard station







Phoenix:
The security guard station. Ms. Oldbag must like junk food. There's a mountain of it on the desk in there.




Main gate







Phoenix:
The main entrance to the studios. They probably have a police officer on patrol out there.October 18Studio One EntranceMaya:
Hey, Nick. It looks like Detective Gumshoe isn't here today.Phoenix:
You're right. He's probably up to his neck in paperwork after the commotion at today's trial.Maya:
So, Nick... Remember that "Studio Two" we heard about at the trial today? It was down that path with the fallen tree, right?Phoenix:
Yeah, I think that's what they said.Maya:
Maybe the director and the rest of them are there today? Now's our chance, Nick! Let's check it out!Examine









Bench







Phoenix:
I'm bushed. Maybe I'll sit down here for a bit.
Maya:
This is exactly why I don't want to get old, ever.
Phoenix:
H-hey! I'm still young! I'm just tired!
Maya:
Nick, when you start having to say "I'm still young," you know it's all over.
Phoenix:
(But... but I AM still young!)




Left path







Phoenix:
In the trial, they said Studio Two was down this path. The monkey head is in the way, but we should be able to get by it without a problem.
Maya:
This monkey head is real heavy!
Phoenix:
Well, it did knock that tree over when it fell.
Maya:
Both of these, the monkey head and the tree, fell the day of the murder, didn't they.
Phoenix:
Yeah, that's what Detective Gumshoe said.




Statue with broken head







Phoenix:
The studio mascot. Apparently it's a monkey of some kind. I've never seen a monkey with a nose like that before!
Maya:
Why don't they put his head back on? Maybe we should ask that assistant?
Phoenix:
I'm not sure we really want her fixing anything. And you'd probably need a crane to move that thing.
Maya:
Probably so.




Security camera







Phoenix:
That's the security camera that automatically takes pictures of people here. It took two pictures on the day of the murder, before the actual time of death. One of them was the Steel Samurai. The other was a grade school boy. It doesn't seem to be switched on today.




Studio One entrance







Phoenix:
The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.




Welcome sign







Maya:
It says "Welcome."
Phoenix:
They let people in here when they're not filming, right?
Maya:
Nick! Let's come here some day! Whaddya say?
Phoenix:
Sure, if that security lady lets us in.October 18Studio OneMaya:
I... don't really want to be in here.Phoenix:
Yeah... It is a murder scene.Maya:
I want to go someplace else. Nick?Phoenix:
(*sigh*...)Examine









Film camera







Maya:
Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!
Phoenix:
Yeah! So don't touch it!
Maya:
Hey, smile, Nick, you're a star!
Phoenix:
S-stop that!




Reflecting screen







Phoenix:
That's for reflecting light. They call it a reflecting screen or something like that.
Maya:
Huh.
Phoenix:
What? Where's your enthusiasm for all things entertainment?
Maya:
Well, lighting is fine, but I'd want to be the director. Or maybe the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
(I think she's being serious...!)




Stage backdrop







Phoenix:
Looks like a backdrop for a stage. This must be used in the Steel Samurai show.
Maya:
Of course! That's the mountain, Neo Fujiyama!
Phoenix:
Doesn't the Steel Samurai take place in Olde Tokyo? Can you even see Mt. Fuji from there?
Maya:
Not Olde Tokyo, Nick! "Neo" Olde Tokyo!October 18Studio Two EntranceMaya:
This... is Studio Two?Phoenix:
I thought so...Maya:
It doesn't really look much like a "studio," does it?Phoenix:
No, that it does not.Maya:
Hey... There's a trailer over there.Phoenix:
It looks pretty sturdy for a movie set trailer.Maya:
Are we sure this is a studio?Examine









Incinerator







Phoenix:
An incinerator. Apparently they just put this one in. It's already covered in soot. They must not clean it much.




Lunch table







Phoenix:
Looks like two people ate here. There's nothing left on the plates.
Maya:
Hey, so they ate t-bone steaks too.
Phoenix:
What is it with steaks around here?
Maya:
Hey! There's always room for steak! But... something does seem out of place...
Phoenix:
What?
Maya:
I... don't know. It just feels "odd."




Number "2" sign







Phoenix:
There's a big "2" painted here.
Maya:
Probably because this is Studio Two?
Phoenix:
Probably... Though it doesn't look anything like a studio.




Studio van







Phoenix:
A light van for moving staff and equipment around. They've kept it in pretty good shape. Looks like it'd run fine.
Maya:
Well, let's go for a drive!
Phoenix:
Sure... if I had a license.
Maya:
Nick! You don't have a driver's license!?
Phoenix:
But, look, I have this!
Maya:
Why are you showing me your attorney's badge, Nick?




Flower garden







Phoenix:
There're some flowers here.
Maya:
Wow, so pretty! They're taking good care of these.
Phoenix:
Don't get to [sic] close. That fence looks dangerous.




Storage materials







Phoenix:
These look like materials for making a movie set.
Maya:
They've been sitting here for quite some time. This might as well be a junkyard.




Trailer







Phoenix:
On closer inspection, this trailer looks like it's been here for a while. I don't think this is part of some temporary film set.




Trailer door







Maya:
Nick! Let's go inside!
Phoenix:
You think it's okay...? Oh well. It's locked.
Maya:
Aww... shucks.October 18Global StudiosEmployee AreaMaya:
Look, it's that assistant girl. Hey!Penny:
Hi... WP's lawyers, right? I heard about the trial! Great job, guys!Phoenix:
Oh? Oh hoh hoh. Don't mention it.Penny:
Is it true they caught the security lady!?Phoenix:
Oh! Oh... oh hoh hoh!Penny:
Actually, she just called me. She told me to cover up that drain...Phoenix:
You mean that one? (Wow, what a mess...)Penny:
I... I know... I'm not so good with handiwork. Some assistant, right?Maya:
Yeah, but you do work on the props, and the backdrops, right?Penny:
R-right. Just... lots of times they end up looking worse than they did before I fixed them.Maya:
Oh? Oh! Well, I'm sure these things happen. Nothing to worry yourself about!Penny:
You're right! I won't!Phoenix:
(Personally, I think she should worry at least a little bit more...)Penny:
Um, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to the guard station. I'm supposed to fill in for Ms. Oldbag.Maya:
Right! See you later, then!Penny:
Good luck with your investigation.Examine









Taped cardboard barrier







Maya:
So, the fanboy they were talking about in the trial today... He came in through that drain?
Phoenix:
So it seems. I guess they covered it up in a hurry.
Maya:
Hey... Hey, Nick! If that drain's covered, the boy won't be able to get in.
Phoenix:
Uh, yeah. I think that was the idea...?
Maya:
I feel kinda sorry for him, though. Don't you?
Phoenix:
What, you want to rip the grate off?
Maya:
Really, Nick? We can!?
Phoenix:
(Whoa... she's serious? Uh oh...)



Rip it open







Phoenix:
Well, I guess some things are just made to be broken.
Maya:
Yay! You know, Nick, you're pretty swell sometimes.
Phoenix:
(Sometimes...?)
Maya:
Hiii-ya! There. That should make the kids happy.
Phoenix:
The things we do...
Leads back to examination




Leave it be







Phoenix:
Nah, I think we should leave it on. They only just repaired it. And if we take it off, that assistant will get yelled at by you-know-who.
Maya:
Yeah... I guess so.
Phoenix:
(Wow! I didn't expect her to take it that hard...)
Leads back to examination





Drain grate (after selecting "Rip it open" upon examining taped cardboard barrier)







Phoenix:
The drain grate is off. And I know who did it.
Maya:
Now the kids'll be able to come in again. Doesn't it make you feel great to do a good deed like that?
Phoenix:
(Must be nice to live so free of guilt.)




Lunch table







Phoenix:
The remains of yesterday's lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak.




Dressing room door







Phoenix:
The door to the dressing room. It's not locked.
Maya:
Hey, Nick! Let's go in! Maybe there'll be something else to steal?
Phoenix:
H-hey! We're not thieves!
Maya:
But we did take that cardkey...
Phoenix:
W-we borrowed that! There's a difference.




Vending machine







Phoenix:
Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks or something. Popcorn, at least!
Maya:
W-wait! Look! "Samurai Soda"! Nick! Try this!
Phoenix:
Be my guest.
Maya:
Okay! Oh, too bad, it's sold out.October 18Global StudiosDressing RoomMaya:
This is where the Steel Samurai costume was, on the day of the murder.Phoenix:
That's what Mr. Powers says, at least. I guess they snuck in and took it while he was sleeping.Maya:
But Nick, what if Mr. Powers hadn't been sleeping? I wonder what the killer was planning on doing then?Phoenix:
Huh... (She's got a point!)Examine









Cosmetics







Phoenix:
There's an array of cosmetics here. According to Maya, that wig was used in some old TV show...
Maya:
"Samurai Boogey-Woogey," Nick! Get with the picture!
Phoenix:
Look, explain to me how you can identify a show just by seeing a wig!?
Maya:
I, um, kinda like samurai movies.
Phoenix:
("Kinda"...?)




Costume rack







Phoenix:
There's some regular suits in among the costumes here. Those must be Mr. Powers's personal clothes.




Couch







Phoenix:
Looks like someone was sleeping here. Maybe Powers did take a nap here, like he said.




Bag







Maya:
Mr. Powers's bag. I wonder what's inside? Hey! Supermarket tabloids? Wow. I'm kind of shocked.
Phoenix:
Maya! Leave those alone! (Wolf Men Found On Mars...? I'll have to buy that issue!)




Table







Phoenix:
There's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Some tea and cookies...
Maya:
Wait... Nick!
Phoenix:
W-what now?
Maya:
These snacks... they've passed the expiration date!
Phoenix:
... Then don't eat them.
Maya:
*grumble* (They're snacks! They're meant to be eaten!)




Window







Phoenix:
It's locked. I guess he doesn't open his window much. It is kind of dusty outside.Studio - Main Gate (after selecting "Rip it open" upon examining taped cardboard barrier in Global Studios - Employee Area)Penny:
Oh... hello.Maya:
Ho hoh! You look a little out of place.Penny:
It's the clothes, isn't it? I thought my camo vest might do the trick... Kind of an "alternative guard fashion" thing.Examine









Guard station







Phoenix:
The security guard station. I can see the computer that runs the security cameras.
Penny:
Oh, please don't touch anything in there. The security lady would knock the stuffing out of me if she knew.Talk









The studios







Phoenix:
So, how are the studios doing?
Penny:
There's police wandering around everywhere, it's terrible. They won't even let me clean up. Don't want me "disturbing evidence." I haven't even cleaned up our lunch plates from the day of the murder!
Phoenix:
You mean those plates with the steak bones left over on them in the employee area?
Penny:
Yeah. Can you believe it?




The fanboy







Maya:
Do kids sneak in here a lot?
Penny:
Well... I don't think there's that many of them, but I do see one in particular a bunch. He's always gawking at the sets, or snapping pictures. You should see Old Windbag's eyes flash when she sees him. She has a bit of trouble catching him though...




The director, et al.







Phoenix:
I heard something at the trial today. They said that the director and producer were here the day of the murder...
Penny:
Oh, sorry... I was in the prop storage room, so I didn't see them. I guess they were here, though. The studio head seemed pretty eager to keep us quiet.
Maya:
So they were trying to protect the director?
Penny:
More the producer, really. The producer's our real star here. She saved these studios from the brink of disaster and kept them running. I don't think we'd still be in business if it weren't for that producer!
Phoenix:
(The producer, huh?)Present









Cardkey







Penny:
Wow, they gave a lawyer one of those cardkeys?
Phoenix:
Well, I'm sort of borrowing it.
Penny:
I see. You better be careful not to lose that. They're very strict about those cardkeys here.
Phoenix:
(I guess they're pretty good about keeping these out of outsider's hands.) Thanks, I'll be careful.




Powers's(?) Photo







Phoenix:
Could you take a look at this?
Penny:
That's Mr. Powers. Why is he dragging his leg like that? What is this, anyway?
Phoenix:
(Looks like she didn't know about this photo or the injury that morning.) Uh... Never mind.




Samurai Spear







Phoenix:
Say, you work with the props, right? About that murder weapon...
Penny:
You mean the Samurai Spear? Yeah, it's a prop, but it's still pretty heavy. I hate having to carry that thing around.
Phoenix:
(So you'd have to be pretty strong to use that as a weapon, it sounds like. Why is Mr. Powers the only person I can think of!?)

The day of the crime







Phoenix:
Did you notice anything unusual on the day of the murder?
Manella:
Oh, I know who j00 d00dz are. That security lady told j00 about us, eh?
Phoenix:
That's right.
Manella:
It was a pretty regular day. We had a run-through for an action scene in the morning. Then a meeting from lunchtime in the Studio Two trailer. Heh. I was so busy I didn't even get a chance to eat lunch! :(
Phoenix:
A t-bone steak, was it?
Manella:
Yeah... sux0rz! I hate missing out on food...
Maya:
Nick... what does "Sucksores" mean?
Phoenix:
No idea...
Manella:
Anyway, I was in a meeting from noon till after 4:00. With the producer, and some bigwigs from the network.
Phoenix:
(Mr. Hammer's time of death was estimated at 2:30 PM. If he's telling the truth, that meeting gives him an alibi...)




The producer (appears after "The day of the crime")







Phoenix:
About the producer who was at the meeting with you...
Manella:
Oh, you mean Dee Vasquez? She's a genius. M4d sk1llz, all the way. Scary, though. *sweats* She brought these studios back from the brink of destruction. She's the one who made it possible for me to make the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
You had a meeting with her on the day of the murder, right?
Manella:
Yeah, we were together from noon to 4:00 PM, the whole time.




The bigwigs (appears after "The day of the crime")







Phoenix:
Who exactly are these "bigwigs" people keep mentioning?
Manella:
Oh, the boss over at the network, and some sponsors. Also a few production guys. They piled into a limousine and got here right around noon. Major tension! *sweats*
Phoenix:
Were all of them with you the entire time?
Manella:
Yeah, unfortunately. They're all gray-haired geezers... *scowl*

Left poster







Phoenix:
Another old movie poster. "'The Singing Samurai' starring Jack Hammer." What the hell do samurai sing about? Chopping off heads?
Maya:
Oh. My. God. That movie was the best! It's about a samurai who sings his way to fame and fortune! Mr. Hammer was a very accomplished singer, you know.
Phoenix:
Singing samurai stars... What's next? Ninja ballet?




Middle poster







Phoenix:
"'Samurai Summer' starring Jack Hammer." This poster's quite old.
Maya:
Wow! It's been years since I saw that show! It was one of those typical summer romance stories... but it was great!
Phoenix:
A typical summer romance... with a samurai on a horse?




Right poster







Phoenix:
An old movie poster. "'Dynamite Samurai' starring Jack Hammer." I guess Mr. Hammer used to be quite the star.




Table







Phoenix:
This is where they had that meeting. There are documents and paper cups scattered around.




Trash can







Phoenix:
Nothing in here that could be a clue. Just some paper cups and crumpled documents.




Whiteboard







Phoenix:
It looks like they were designing a set to use for the Steel Samurai show. They've got some figures for how much the set costs... I can't believe they spend that much money on those sets!




Window







Phoenix:
The glass is frosted. I can't see outside. This far into October, the dimming daylight makes it feel like winter's coming.Talk









The day of the crime







Phoenix:
I was wondering if you could tell me about the day of the murder...
Vasquez:

Phoenix:
M-Ms. Vasquez?
Vasquez:

Phoenix:
E-excuse me?
Vasquez:
Script. I'm looking for a script.

Umm... could we ask you a bit about the day of the murder?
Vasquez:
I need to read it. ...

The Steel Samurai







Maya:
Um, w-we'd really like to ask you about the Steel Samurai!

Ms. Vasquez?
Vasquez:
It's on TV. Every week. That's all I have to say about that.
Maya:
N-Nick! She's telling us to go watch TV!? The nerve of her!
Phoenix:
Hey, don't get mad at me.




The director







Phoenix:
About the director... Sal Manella, was it? What, er, exactly is his role here...?
Vasquez:
Perhaps I didn't make myself clear? I'm looking for a script. I can't be bothered with anything else. ...
Maya:
Nick? Are all people in the entertainment business this... weird?
Phoenix:
It's starting to look like it.Present

Huh? "Bring the script for Episode 13"? Episode 13... where did I put that one? ... I must have left it somewhere... *sweats* U-uh oh... My ass is p0wned if I don't find it... *shakes*
Maya:
Nick... It might be quicker to just look in all the places where he's likely to have been.

Director's chair







Maya:
Hey! Look! That's the chair the director sits in! I've always wanted to sit in one of these.
Phoenix:

Maya:
Ahah! Found it, Nick! The script!

Good work!
Script placed in pocket.

Am I a suspect?
Maya:
N-no, it's just, well, no, but...
Vasquez:
... You wanted to know about the day of the murder?
Maya:
Y-yes. Anything you could tell us would be a big help.
Vasquez:
... You know there was a meeting here at noon?
Phoenix:
Yes. With the director and the people from the network...
Vasquez:
Correct. Now, listen closely. None of the people in this trailer that afternoon went to Studio One. It was impossible for us to leave.
Maya:
Impossible? Why?
Vasquez:
The path was blocked.
Phoenix:
The... path?Phoenix:
On the day of the murder, the path that leads here was blocked?Vasquez:
You saw Mr. Monkey on the way here, correct?Phoenix:
M-"Mr. Monkey"?Vasquez:
The monkey with the broken head.Phoenix:
Oh, right, that... (What an original name...)Vasquez:
Its head fell over in the wind on the day of the murder. They didn't start moving the head out of the way until after 3:00. It was after 4:00 by the time the path was unblocked. Capice? Everyone in this trailer was stuck here until the path was cleared. Stuck in this trailer. Stuck until after 4:00. Hammer died at 2:30. Thus, none of us could have gone to Studio One.Maya:
W-what!?Vasquez:
It's true. A crane came just after 3:00 to move the head. We called some people in to clear the way. I'm sure they'd corroborate my story.Phoenix:
B-but wait! What if the head fell over after 2:30? Then you could have gone to Studio One!Vasquez:
2:30... the time of death. ... Very well. Come.Outside Studio OneVasquez:

Check its head. The clock inside stopped when it broke.Maya:

Bench







Phoenix:
I really want to take a break, but we have work to do! Still, it's kind of sad to see so many empty benches... Kind of like if you threw a party, and nobody came.




Left path







Phoenix:
This is the path that goes to Studio Two. The mascot's head fell right on the path on the day of the murder. The path was completely blocked between 2:00 and 4:00.




Mr. Monkey

Director's chair







Phoenix:
A classic director's chair. I'm surprised they don't have an extra large one for Mr. Manella.




Film camera







Phoenix:
A collection of expensive film equipment. I can't even begin to imagine how much just one of these costs. If we broke one, we'd go bankrupt for sure.




Reflecting screen







Phoenix:
A panel for reflecting light. They call it a "reflecting board" or something.




Stage backdrop







Phoenix:
A stage backdrop. This is "Neo Fujiyama," according to Maya. It looks incredibly fake, but I guess the kids don't mind.

There's a big "2" painted here. Probably because this is Studio Two? Probably... Though it doesn't look anything like a studio.




Studio van







Phoenix:
A light van for moving staff and equipment around. They've kept it in pretty good shape. Looks like it'd run fine.




Flower garden

Nameless flowers bloom in solitude. They probably have a proper name... But it is not for me to know. Not now, nor ever till the end of my days. ... I need a vacation.

R-right... (C'mon, think of something!) I really like his, um, his kind nature. What a guy!
Cody:
Totally! He looks so tough, but inside, he's as gentle as a kitten!
Phoenix:
Yeah...
Cody:
So, what else do you like about him?
Phoenix:
(Don't tell me I have to keep this act up...)
Leads back to:
"So, tell me what your favorite thing about the Steel Samurai is!"




His fighting skills







Leads to:
"Got to think of something..."




Will Powers's acting







Phoenix:
W-well... (I've never even seen a full episode of that dumb show.) A-actually, I'm kind of a fan of Will Powers...
Cody:
Whoa! That's totally hard-core!
Phoenix:
(You're calling ME hard-core?)
Cody:
So, what else do you like about him?
Phoenix:
(Don't tell me I have to keep this act up...)
Leads back to:
"So, tell me what your favorite thing about the Steel Samurai is!"


Phoenix:
(Got to think of something...) I like it when he, uh, he vanquishes his foes!
Cody:
Yeah! Whizzam! The Steel Samurai always wins! Always! Check this out! It's my fan album!
Phoenix:
What the...? It's all pictures of the Steel Samurai.
Cody:
I go to every live performance!
Phoenix:
(Those stupid publicity stunts where they beat each other up in public...?)
Cody:
I always take a picture when the Steel Samurai lands the final blow! Whizzam! I got 'em all! I never missed one! A perfect collection! Check it out! My new digital camera!
Mia:
Wow, that's very impressive. The newest model, isn't it?
Cody:
You bet, lady! I just got it for my birthday. My album has a name, wanna hear it? "The Steel Samurai: Path To Glory." The Steel Samurai always wins! Always! Hey, if you want this, you can have it, lady.
Mia:
Really? Are you sure?
Cody:
Yeah, I took these with a digital camera. I got all the data at home so I can always make another one.
Mia:
Well, then I'm happy to accept! Thank you.
"Path to Glory" received.
Phoenix:
(What's with people always giving stuff to Mia? What a life!)
Mia:
?




The Steel Samurai (subsequent times)







Phoenix:
So... you like the Steel Samurai.
Cody:
Well, yeah! Duh! He's so strong!
Phoenix:
I... I guess.
Cody:
You're judging him by his looks! You have to look at his actions, at his life!
Phoenix:
(I'm being lectured on life by a grade schooler...)




What happened







Phoenix:
You were here on the day of the... incident, right?
Cody:
Yeah...
Phoenix:
Did you see anything unusual?
Cody:
...
Mia:
Cody.
Cody:
!
Mia:
Cody, he needs to know because he's fighting for justice. Isn't that the Steel Samurai's motto? "For great justice"? You have to help us fight for great justice, too.
Cody:
I... I saw... I saw everything!
Phoenix:
(Well, well... We might get some useful information out of him yet.)

Phoenix:
Thanks for this.
Cody:
Hey, I gave that to the nice lady, not you, loser! No looking at that, okay!
Phoenix:
(Believe me, I wasn't going to...)Phoenix:
Cody... I need to ask you something very important. What did you see on the day of the incident?Cody:
... I got here that day around 2:00... I had to come in through the woods out back so that old lady wouldn't see me. I got kinda lost, though. I was in there for maybe a half hour or so. Then I finally got to the studio. After that...Mia:
What is it, Cody?Cody:
Th-the Steel Samurai killed the bad guy! He used his Samurai Spear! Just like always! One shot, one kill! It happened so fast... I got scared. I went home after that.Phoenix:
I... I see. It must have been hard for you.Cody:
Man, you say those nice things but it's so obvious you aren't speaking from the heart.Phoenix:
(Umm... right.) Mia?Mia:
Yes?Phoenix:
I think we can say for sure this means the Steel Samurai did it.Mia:
True enough.Phoenix:
And the director has an alibi, so it wasn't him.Mia:
Indeed.Phoenix:
So... the only person left who it could have been is Will Powers!Mia:
... I have to admit, it's kind of a shock. But if you put this boy on the witness stand, your client will be "guilty" for sure.Phoenix:
Let's not call him then...Mia:
I think that would be wise. Best to leave this one alone.???:
Not so fast, pal!Gumshoe:
I heard everything! This boy here's a key witness! And he's under police protection, starting now! C'mon, son. You've got a rendezvous with me down at the precinct!Cody:
No! I ain't going! Waah!Mia:
... That didn't go so well. We're back to zero leads. And now we have a serious handicap in court.Phoenix:
W-what're we going to do, Mia!Mia:
Well, hmm... I... really need to be going. Don't worry, Phoenix. I'm sure you'll be fine!Phoenix:
Whoa whoa whoa! C-come to the trial tomorrow, please! I need you there!Mia:
Phoenix, can I ask you something? Do you really believe that Mr. Powers is innocent?I believe







Phoenix:
Of course he is!
Mia:
... That's all I wanted to hear. Excellent. I'll see you in court, then.
Leads to:
"Great! Thanks, Mia!"I don't know







Phoenix:
(I never expected things to go this badly for Powers's case... I'm not sure we can win this one.)
Mia:
Phoenix? If you don't believe him, who will!?
Phoenix:
(Uh oh, she's mad.)
Mia:
Oh well... I'll see you in court tomorrow then.

... ... Umm... Mr. Wright?Phoenix:
Yes?Will:
Why do you look so... unhappy?Phoenix:
O-oh! Oh, nothing! Eh heh heh. Really, it's nothing. Right, Mia? (Uh oh. She looks even unhappier...)Mia:
Phoenix. Your client is now practically a dead man walking... Perhaps that's why I feel particularly close to him.Phoenix:
This is no time for dead-people jokes, please.Mia:
You know we're going into this trial utterly defenseless. Yet, if Mr. Powers is truly innocent... We should be able to find something overlooked in the evidence to prove it.Phoenix:
Something "overlooked"...?Mia:
We have to find something, Phoenix, today. It's that, or lose the trial.Phoenix:
(This isn't going to be easy.)October 19, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:
Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth:
An unexpected fact has come to the attention of the court. Yesterday, we learned that there were other people present at the studios. Today, I would like to show evidence proving they had nothing to do with the murder.Judge:
Very well. You may call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth.Phoenix:
(I wonder if it'll be that producer...) (Changed from [I wonder if that producer is going to come out...] in the original release)Edgeworth:
The prosecution calls Mr. Sal Manella to the stand.Phoenix:
(...or that director.)Edgeworth:
Will the witness state his name and profession?Manella:
... How r00d can j00 get! J00 don't know ME!? I'm the director! I make the Steel Samurai, n00b! ROFL!Edgeworth:
...Manella:
S... Sal Manella. I'm a director. Television.Judge:
Were you at Global Studios on the day of the murder?Manella:
Y-yes, Your Honor.Judge:
Hmm... Very well. Please testify to the court about the events of that day.Mia:
Phoenix. Let's start by picking this testimony apart. If Powers is innocent, you know what that means. Someone in the trailer on that day did it!Phoenix:
R-right. (She doesn't waste any time putting on the pressure!)Witness Testimony-- The Day of the Murder --Manella:
I was at the studios from around 9:00 that morning.
During the morning, I was doing... umm... an action scene run-through.
It took a lot more time than I thought it would.
I hear that everyone else ate lunch in the Employee Area...
But I had a meeting in the Studio Two trailer, so I ended up skipping lunch.
We were in the meeting until around 4:00...
During the meeting, well, I'm pretty sure no one left their chairs.
That's about it.Judge:
Hmm... The time of Mr. Hammer's death was 2:30 PM. And according to your testimony, you were in a meeting at that time. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.Cross Examination-- The Day of the Murder --Manella:
I was at the studios from around 9:00 that morning.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Is that when you always come in to work?
Manella:
Oh, oh no. I come in all sort of hours. It's the "industry" way.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, I know all about the freaks in your "industry"...)
Manella:
Still, FWIW, I was pretty busy all that day. :(
Edgeworth:
Tell us more about that.Manella:
During the morning, I was doing... umm... an action scene run-through.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
In the Employee Area?
Manella:
That's right. It was a fight scene between the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate.
Phoenix:
Was anyone else at the run-through?
Manella:
Oh, yeah. That security lady was sitting there watching the whole thing. LOL. She was cheering on Hammer, if you can believe it.
Phoenix:
(She certainly has the lungs for it...) Anyone else?
Manella:
Nope, just us four.Manella:
It took a lot more time than I thought it would.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Why did it go on so long?
Manella:
Um, I'm pretty sure j00've already heard about this... But WP twisted his ankle during the run-through, see...
Phoenix:
(Oh, right, thus the limp.)
Manella:
Which of course led to me missing my lunch. ROFS!
Phoenix:
(ROFS? Rolling on the Floor... Starving?)Manella:
I hear that everyone else ate lunch in the Employee Area...Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What exactly did they have for lunch?
Manella:
T-bone steak! The assistant cooked some up.
Phoenix:
(Come to think of it, there was a plate with some bones on it in the Employee Area.)
Edgeworth:
"Everyone else" meaning that the witness did not eat with them.Manella:
But I had a meeting in the Studio Two trailer, so I ended up skipping lunch.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So, in the end, you didn't get to eat?
Manella:
Yeah. No steak, at least! Can j00 believe it?
Phoenix:
That must have been tough.
Mia:
Phoenix.
Phoenix:
Yeah?
Mia:
Doesn't something about that seem odd to you?



Not at all







Phoenix:
Well, no, not really. Seems pretty straightforward.
Mia:
Oh. Perhaps I was wrong, then.
Leads back to cross-examination




It's a little vague







Phoenix:
Actually, there is something bothering me. Mr. Manella, just now you said "steak, at least." So you ate something other than steak?
Manella:
Yeah, good call! I had some chocolate in my pocket, which I used to stave off starvation!
Phoenix:
I see... (Is that all? I was sure I was on to something there.)
Leads back to cross-examination




It's contradictory







Phoenix:
Yeah, it does seem odd, now that you mention it. Mr. Manella!
Manella:
H-hmm? W-what do j00 mean? *sweats*
Phoenix:
When I went to Studio Two, I saw something on the table there. (Changed from [When I went to that trailer, I saw something on the table.] in the original release) There were two plates--the same kind of plates as the ones in the Employee Area. (Changed from [There were two plates on the table--the same kind of plates as in the Employee Area.] in the original release) Who ate lunch there?
Manella:
M-mmpf! No, er, ah, um, eh heh. Good call! *sweats* I, er, I was embarrassed so I didn't mention it... But I did eat, after all.
Phoenix:
A t-bone steak, you mean?
Manella:
Yeah, well, I mean the assistant went through all that trouble... I brought it to the trailer thinking I could eat it later.
Phoenix:
(Clearly a man who likes to eat. I'd suspected as much...) So, when exactly did you eat it?
Manella:
We took one break during that meeting. I, er, wolfed it down then. *drool*
Phoenix:
(A mental image I will carry with me to my grave... Wait a second...! If they took a break in that meeting, that contradicts his testimony! I'll press on that one a bit more...)
Leads back to cross-examinationManella:
We were in the meeting until around 4:00...Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What were you discussing?
Manella:
The Steel Samurai story, and our budget. Get this! The sponsors turn to me and say, "Mr. Manella. Those scripts of yours are not appropriate for children." Can j00 believe it!?
Phoenix:
(Actually, I kind of can.) So, nobody left the table during the whole meeting?Manella:
During the meeting, well, I'm pretty sure no one left their chairs.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
You didn't take a single break?
Manella:
Er... well... Y-yeah! Not a one! *sweats*

Press harder







Leads to:
"Wait a second!"




Leave him be







Phoenix:
(No, on second thought, I'm drawing a blank. If I press too hard in the wrong place, I'll just end up scaring him into silence. Maybe I'll just sit back and see what happens.)
Leads back to cross-examinationMia:
Phoenix. If his alibi holds, Powers is finished. Press him as hard as you can and find out where he's lying!Phoenix:
R-right!Phoenix:
Wait a second! Mr. Manella, you've just contradicted yourself! Didn't you just tell the court that you ate that t-bone steak during a break?Manella:
Oops! ROFL!Phoenix:
Well?Manella:
Umm...Judge:
Mr. Manella, what's this all about?Manella:
W-well, yeah, I guess we did take a little break.Mia:
Phoenix! Great job! If they took a break, one of them could have gone to the studio during that time!Phoenix:
Your Honor! I call on the witness to testify to the court about this break!Judge:
Very well. Mr. Manella, your testimony, please.Manella:
Urk!Edgeworth:
Heh heh heh...Phoenix:
(Uh oh. Edgeworth is laughing...)Witness Testimony-- The Break --Manella:
Yeah, FWIW, we took a break... ROFL!
But it was only 15 minutes! 15! That's only 13 in Base 12!
Not enough time for someone to, say, commit murder in Studio One! LOL!
That's only just enough time to eat a t-bone steak, if you ask me! *steams*Judge:
Hmm... I don't think it would even be enough time for that, but that's just me. Very well. You may begin the cross-examination.Cross Examination-- The Break --Manella:
Yeah, FWIW, we took a break... ROFL!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What time exactly did you take this break?
Manella:
Hmm... I'd say it was from around 2:30 or so until 2:45.
Phoenix:
(2:30!!! That's the time of death! So he could have gone to Studio One, killed Hammer, and come back... I guess it's possible, time-wise...)
Edgeworth:

But it was only 15 minutes! 15! That's only 13 in Base 12!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What were you doing for those 15 minutes?
Manella:
Eating my t-bone steak! What else!?
Phoenix:
There were two plates on the trailer table...?
Manella:
Oh, right. The other one was Diva's... sorry, Dee Vasquez's plate.
Phoenix:
(Dee Vasquez... the producer.)
Edgeworth:
To eat a t-bone steak in 15 minutes... that's quite a feat.Manella:
Not enough time for someone to, say, commit murder in Studio One! LOL!Press







Phoenix:

Why is that?Press (after pressing first statement)







Phoenix:

"Why is that?"Manella:
That's only just enough time to eat a t-bone steak, if you ask me! *steams*Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
I have to say, you look like a guy who gets through his meals pretty fast.
Manella:
Well, I was facing a cold, slightly chewy t-bone steak... Even I have to take my time eating that kind of food. LOLMia:
Well, Phoenix?Phoenix:
That testimony was too short to wring any kind of useful information out of!Mia:
All you have to do is prove that he was able to go to Studio One in that time!Phoenix:
(Oh, great. Is that all...)Phoenix:
Why is that?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
Haven't we had enough of this pointless line of questioning? Your Honor! The testimony to this point has made one certain fact painfully clear: The people in the trailer had nothing to do with this murder! It was impossible for any of them to go to Studio One!Phoenix:
What!?Edgeworth:
Something wrong, Mr. Wright? Surely you aren't suggesting one of the people in the trailer went to Studio One!Judge:
Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright?Mia:
Phoenix, this is critical! Think about it before you give your answer!Judge:
Do you claim someone from the trailer went to Studio One?I claim it, and claim it loud







Phoenix:
(If I agree to let everyone in that trailer off the hook then the trial is over... Mr. Powers will be found guilty for sure!) The victim was murdered at 2:30, the exact time of the break in the meeting. With 15 minutes, murder is certainly a possibility!
Judge:
Hmm... I suppose you might say that...
Phoenix:
(Alright, I've got the judge thinking now!)
Edgeworth:
Tsk, tsk, tsk... Never a dull moment with you, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
What's your point, Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
You've been doing your homework, haven't you? Look at the Court Record.
Phoenix:
The Court Record...?
Edgeworth:
Surely, you knew that from 2:15 to 4:00 the path between the studios was blocked? Mrs. Monkey's head had fallen across the path!
Phoenix:
Whoa! You're right!
Edgeworth:
True, the break in the trailer meeting came right at the time of death... However! The path from there to the scene of the crime was blocked! The fallen Mrs. Monkey head barred the way!
Phoenix:
... (It's actually "Mr. Monkey," but Edgeworth has a point... And somehow, I feel no desire to correct him.)
Judge:
No counter-argument, Mr. Wright? Then I'm afraid you lose this round.
Leads to:
"I believe we have seen enough evidence."No, it's impossible.







Phoenix:
(I don't want to write off so many possible suspects... But I can't keep claiming the impossible, either...) I agree that it was impossible for anyone in the trailer to go to the studio in that time.
Edgeworth:
Ha hah! I thought you might be thoughtlessly treading on thin ice again! But I see you had at least an inkling of the truth.
Judge:
What do you mean, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
It's quite simple... True, the break in the trailer meeting came right at the time of death... However! The path from there to the scene of the crime was blocked! The fallen Mrs. Monkey head barred the way! At around 2:15, a strong gust of wind knocked off the studio mascot's head. Ergo! When the people in the trailer took a break at 2:30, the way to the studio was blocked. Blocked... by Mrs. Monkey's severed head!
Phoenix:
... (It's actually "Mr. Monkey," but Edgeworth has a point... And somehow, I feel no desire to correct him.)
Leads to:
"I believe we have seen enough evidence."Edgeworth:
I believe we have seen enough evidence. I would like to relieve Mr. Manella from the stand.Phoenix:
(Wh-what? It's over?)Judge:
Very well. The court's opinion on this case is as follows: We have found that there were several other people in Studio 2 on the day of the murder. However, it is also clear that none of these people could have gone to Studio One. They therefore have no relation to this case. Furthermore, with regards to the photo of the Steel Samurai... Given the size of the costume, no one other than Mr. Powers could have worn it that day. All that is lacking is decisive evidence that he is the one who did it. If we had that, I'm afraid I would have to find Mr. Powers guilty.Edgeworth:
Your Honor. The prosecution is pleased to announce that we indeed have decisive evidence: a witness.Judge:
Who is this witness, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:
My witness saw the very moment when the Steel Samurai skewered the victim!Judge:
Order! I will have order! I see. The court will take a 10 minute recess, after which we will hear your witness. Court is adjourned for recess!October 19, 11:04 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Mia:
...Phoenix:
What do we do now, Mia? If everyone in that trailer has an alibi...Mia:
... I'm sorry, Phoenix. I guess I was wrong.Phoenix:
M-Mia! Don't tell me you're giving up! If you give up, what hope do I have...?Mia:
... Don't get me wrong. I've never given up on a trial before, not while there was a chance. Only one thing became clear in your cross-examination. The people in the trailer could not have gone to Studio One. I thought there was more to it than that... But I was wrong. That's all there is.Will:
Umm... Er... What's going to happen to me? It kinda seems like everyone in that courtroom thinks I did it... They think I'm a murderer!Mia:
Don't worry, Mr. Powers. If you are innocent, we will prove it. I guarantee it. Leave it to us, and... be yourself. Be strong. You are the Steel Samurai, hero to children everywhere, after all.Will:
I... You... Thanks. *sniff*Mia:
Okay, Phoenix. This one's for the kids! Let's do it!October 19, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:
Court is back in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:
The prosecution has a concern. As our witness is a grade schooler of tender years, and this is a murder case... we worry that the defense might cause unnecessary trauma with his cruel questioning. (Changed from [We worry that the defense might cause unnecessary trauma with his cruel questioning!] in the original release)Phoenix:
(Nice to see Edgeworth taking the moral high ground...)Edgeworth:
However, we have no choice. The prosecution calls Cody Hackins to the stand.Edgeworth:
Your Honor. Perhaps you could arrange a box for him to stand on?Judge:
Oh, r-right. Guard, please bring him a box. One of those donut crates should do.Edgeworth:
Will the witness state his name and grade in school.Cody:

Very well, Cody. Please testify to the court about what you saw the day of the incident.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Cody:
I wanted to see a Steel Samurai rehearsal, just once.
I found a map on the Internet, and went to the studios that day.

N-no, I wasn't. I-it's not like I have it all the time!
Phoenix:
(Really...?)Present Cody's Camera







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Cody, what you just said seems, well, a little strange."Phoenix:
(I guess seeing the killing freaked him out and he went home...)Mia:
Phoenix. Remember, he's a child. Use gentle words... but be firm.Phoenix:
(Easy for you to say...)Phoenix:
Cody, what you just said seems, well, a little strange. Didn't you say before that you always bring your digital camera wherever you go? You were quite clear about that.Cody:
Huh!?Phoenix:
Cody, you shouldn't lie here. You understand that, right?Judge:
Mr. Wright! A word with you...Phoenix:
(Uh oh... was I putting the pressure on too much?)Judge:
What is this "digital" camera contraption you're talking about?Phoenix:
It's umm... a digital camera, Your Honor. It's kind of a new sort of camera. (How do I explain that!?)Judge:
I see.Phoenix:
Anyway, Cody... I can't believe you wouldn't bring your camera on a trip to the studios! You did bring it, didn't you?Cody:
Umm...Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright! How cruel you are, to terrorize a poor child so!Phoenix:
I don't care if he's a child or a prosecuting attorney! No one should lie in court!Edgeworth:
What do you mean "or a prosecuting attorney"!?Phoenix:
Well, Cody?Cody:
Wh-what! Yeah, so I had my camera. So what!? You got a problem with that!?Judge:
So, you did have a camera? And did you use this camera?Cody:
W-why would I use it? I... I was too busy watching.Judge:
Hmm... Very well. Please testify to the court about what you were so busy watching.Witness Testimony-- What I Saw --Cody:
Y-yeah, I had my camera with me.
But I was glued to the action! I couldn't take my eyes off it!
The Steel Samurai, he goes for the bad guy... wham!
Then... then the bad guy stopped moving!
He's so strong! The Steel Samurai rules!Judge:
Hmm... Ah? Is that all? Well, that was brief. Mr. Wright, your cross-examination.Cross Examination-- What I Saw --Cody:
Y-yeah, I had my camera with me.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So, why didn't you use it?
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
He's getting to that! Relax and listen.
Cody:
Umm... I didn't use it 'cause I was too busy watching the real thing!Cody:
But I was glued to the action! I couldn't take my eyes off it!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So you were watching the Steel Samurai. Did you watch the whole fight?
Cody:
Y-yeah, of course!
Phoenix:
You didn't turn away, not even once?
Cody:
N... no!
Phoenix:
Okay, then tell us exactly what happened.
Cody:
Y-yeah! I'm getting to that!Cody:
The Steel Samurai, he goes for the bad guy... wham!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So the bad guy attacked him first?
Cody:
Yeah!
Phoenix:
What sort of person was this "bad guy"?
Cody:
I told you, a person. He was a person.
Phoenix:
How was he dressed?
Cody:
... I kinda don't remember. I was too busy watching the Steel Samurai!
Edgeworth:
I see. And what happened next?Cody:
Then... then the bad guy stopped moving!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Why?
Cody:
Huh? Whaddya mean, "why"?
Phoenix:
Why wasn't the bad guy moving?
Cody:
W-well 'cause the Steel Samurai brought him to justice!
Phoenix:
And how exactly did he do that?
Cody:
H-how did he do it? With a Samurai Kick! And a Samurai Punch! Samurai Chop! ... Samurai Slap! S-something like that.
Phoenix:
(He's still being vague about this...)
Cody:
What! Don't gimme that look, pops!
Phoenix:
(How should I play this?)



Wait and see what happens







Phoenix:
(Yeah... If I press too hard now, the judge might keep me from continuing. I'll sit back and see how the rest of this goes.)
Leads back to cross-examination




Press him harder







Leads to:
"Cody."Cody:
He's so strong! The Steel Samurai rules!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What did you do after the bad guy fell, Cody?
Cody:
... Um, actually... The fight was so... so intense that I got kinda scared. So I went straight home.
Phoenix:
(Something isn't adding up here...)Phoenix:
(Something about his account doesn't seem right...)Mia:
Phoenix. It doesn't seem right because he's being deliberately vague! Press him on the facts, Phoenix! Find out what he saw!Phoenix:
Cody.Cody:
Wh-what!?Phoenix:
Something's bothering me. Before you said that you "couldn't take your eyes off" the action.Cody:
Y-yeah? So what?Phoenix:
Yet you missed the most important part!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
What is the meaning of this? The witness has stated what he saw quite clearly...Phoenix:Phoenix:
You know as well as I do that he's being vague! Tell me, what kind of murderer uses a "Samurai Slap"!?Edgeworth:
M-mmph!Phoenix:
My point is this: Cody, you may have seen some of the Steel Samurai's fight... But you missed the most important part: the killing blow!Judge:
Order! Order! Mr. Wright! How could this be? Can you explain how he might have missed something so vital?Phoenix:
Um, well... er, that's the thing...Mia:
Phoenix! I believe you're on the right track with this! Think: why didn't Cody see the climax of the fight? I know you! You can figure this out!Judge:
Mr. Wright, your answer! We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai... Why wouldn't he watch the climax of the fight?He couldn't watch it







Phoenix:
Because he couldn't watch it! How could he calmly watch a murder taking place at his age!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Just a moment, please... One thing has become quite clear in this boy's testimony. He did not believe he was witnessing a murder! He was watching the Steel Samurai fight, like on TV. The more real the fight, the more he would have watched!
Phoenix:
Umm... huh.
Judge:
I have to agree with Mr. Edgeworth. Well, Mr. Wright. Do you have another explanation?
Leads back to:
"We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai..."He was watching something else







Phoenix:
He missed the climax of the fight... because he was looking at something else! Probably!
Edgeworth:
"Probably"?
Judge:
"Something else"?
Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright, explain yourself! What could possibly distract this boy from seeing his idol, the Steel Samurai, fight!? What do you claim he was looking at?
Phoenix:
O-ooof! (C'mon, think of something... think of something... Nothing.)
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Please refrain from making baseless claims!
Phoenix:
Y-yes... Sorry, Your Honor.
Judge:
Do you have another explanation for this?
Leads back to:
"We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai..."Show evidence







Phoenix:
Your Honor, I have evidence.
Judge:
"Evidence"...?
Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. Why did Cody look away from the fight?



Present Cody's Camera







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Here's my proof!"




Present anything else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Here's my proof!
Judge:
Proof?
Phoenix:
Um, uh... Can I... do that again? (This doesn't prove anything...!)
Edgeworth:
Hah! Lost your nerve, have you?
Judge:
Very well... I'll ask you the question again.
Leads back to:
"We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai..."Phoenix:
Here's my proof!Judge:
What's that? The camera...?Phoenix:
The witness stated that he recently received this camera.Judge:
Yes, I'm aware of that.Phoenix:
He wasn't entirely familiar with its operation.Judge:
I'm aware of that, too. Ah!Phoenix:
Correct! Why would Cody be looking somewhere else at the critical moment? Because he was looking at his camera! He was trying to take a picture!Cody:
Hey!Phoenix:
Bullseye!Cody:
W-what's your problem, pops! You got a thing for picking on little kids!?Phoenix:
(Pressing, not picking...)Mia:
Good job, Phoenix! Cody was lying, clearly. Smart of you to realize there was no way he could just stand there, watching his hero... and not take a picture!Phoenix:
Right! Cody? There was only one reason why you would have looked away from the fight. And that was because you wanted to take a picture. But having just received your camera, you weren't used to using it yet! So, you missed the climax of the fight. Correct?Cody:
... ... ... Yeah.Mia:
Well, Phoenix. I'll bet you anything he's hiding more than that. Have him testify again!Phoenix:
R-right. (Mia means business!) Your Honor. The defense would like to request that Cody Hackins testify once more.Judge:
V-very well. Cody? Could you please tell us about your camera... And about why you didn't take a picture of the fight?Cody:
Umm...Phoenix:
(Welcome to the real world, kid!)Witness Testimony-- No Photo? --Cody:
Yeah, you're right, pops.
The Steel Samurai had just escaped from the clutches of the villain.
So I held up my camera to take a picture!
But the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it.
Th-that's all that happened. Yup.Judge:
Hmm... Anything strange in that testimony, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:
I'm not sure... But I'd like to proceed with the cross-examination anyway.Cross Examination-- No Photo? --Cody:
Yeah, you're right, pops.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
"Pops"...?
Cody:
Yeah, I called you "pops," you spiky-haired geezer!
Phoenix:
G-geezer...?
Edgeworth:
I'm "Mr. Edgeworth."
Judge:
And I guess I'm the "bearded gentleman"...
Cody:
That's what I hate about grown-ups. You're all so self-conscious!
Phoenix:
Okay, off with the kid gloves! Testify, witness, testify!
Cody:
Yipes!Cody:
The Steel Samurai had just escaped from the clutches of the villain.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So you did see the beginning of the fight?
Cody:
Yeah.
Phoenix:
Did you notice anything unusual?
Cody:
Umm... well... uh... I guess the Steel Samurai was moving a little strange...
Phoenix:
(Moving... strangely?)Cody:
So I held up my camera to take a picture!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Why couldn't you take a picture?
Cody:
My new camera has too many buttons. I couldn't figure it out. I tried to take a picture, I really tried.Cody:
But the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
When the lens opened, what did you see?
Cody:
Uh... well, a person on the ground. And the Steel Samurai!Cody:
Th-that's all that happened. Yup.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
That's all?
Cody:
Y-yeah! I told you, I didn't take a picture!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... I would have, once I got that lens open... Did he really not take a picture? Not even one?)



Press him hard







Phoenix:
(Nah, he definitely would have taken a picture. There's got to be something here I can use!) Cody! Listen up, Cody Hackins. I know exactly what happened that day. You took a picture!
Cody:
... Hey!
Phoenix:
(Bullseye...?)
Cody:
H-how did you know!?
Phoenix:
I see through all your lies Cody Hackins. It's one of my powers!
Cody:
W-wow!
Phoenix:
(This feels great!)
Cody:
Y-yeah... Yeah, I took a picture.
Judge:
Perhaps you can change your testimony to reflect this, Cody?
Changes statement from "Th-that's all that happened. Yup." to "I took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em."




Let it slide







Phoenix:
(He looks ready to burst into tears... I'd better lay off him for now.)
Leads back to cross-examinationCody:
I took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
You "erased" them?
Cody:
Y-yeah!
Phoenix:
Why would you erase a picture of your beloved Steel Samurai, victorious?
Cody:
Well... y'know. W-why would I want to keep a picture like that?
Phoenix:
(Hmm... he's becoming less and less cooperative. I better find a clear contradiction soon... or some solid evidence.)Present "Path to Glory"







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Cody!"Phoenix:
(How can I pick holes in such a short testimony?)Mia:
There has to be something. Dig up the dirt, Phoenix! Find out what this kid's all about!Phoenix:
Cody!Cody:
Wh-wh-what!? Man, every time you say "Cody" you follow it with something bad.Phoenix:
I just wanted to thank you for giving me this the other day.Cody:
Huh? O-oh... right.Phoenix:
What was it you told me then?Cody:
I go to every live performance! I always take a picture when the Steel Samurai lands the final blow! Whizzam! I got 'em all! I never missed one! A perfect collection!Phoenix:
Cody. Did you really get a picture of the Steel Samurai standing victorious over his foe? If you did, I find it hard to believe that you would just erase it! Wouldn't you keep it for your album?Cody:
Ah!Judge:
Mr. Wright... What exactly is this album?Phoenix:
It's called "Path to Glory." It's a collection of pictures of the Steel Samurai, all taken by Cody Hackins. He claims it's a perfect collection of every battle the Steel Samurai has won!Judge:
I... I see.Phoenix:
Don't you find this very odd, Your Honor? Among all his pictures of the Steel Samurai, none were taken that day!Judge:
Order! Mr. Wright. Have you an explanation? If the Steel Samurai had just defeated his adversary... I certainly would expect to see a picture of it in this album...Phoenix:
Exactly my point, Your Honor! ... ... .........! (No... wait... no way!)Mia:
Phoenix? I think we've finally discovered the truth. And what a truth it is!Phoenix:
M-Mia... are we sure about this? Did he actually...?Mia:
Yes. I'm pretty sure what you're thinking is right. Tell them, Phoenix. Tell them what the truth is.Judge:
Mr. Wright! Please explain to the court what is going on here! Why was there no picture in the album from the day of the murder? Why would the boy have erased the photos he took?The photos were blurry







Phoenix:
I believe that Cody Hackins is what we call an "artiste."
Judge:
An... "artiste"...?
Phoenix:
He didn't like the photos he had taken! They were blurry, or maybe his framing was off... Anyway, for some reason, he erased the data!
Judge:
Is that right, Cody?
Cody:
Wh-what do you mean "framing was off"!?
Judge:
It seems the only thing "off" is your guesswork, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Um, uh... Yes, well, I'm sure the real reason is...
Judge:
Yes? The real reason is?
Leads back to:
"Why was there no picture in the album from the day of the murder?"He erased them by mistake







Phoenix:
Simple, Your Honor. Cody wasn't used to using his new camera. He erased those photos he took by mistake!
Mia:
W-wait a second, Phoenix. If that's your answer, we're back where we started!
Phoenix:
Huh? You mean, that wasn't it?
Judge:
Mr. Wright! If you have something to say to the court, speak up!
Phoenix:
Um, well... S-sorry, Your Honor. Can I change my answer?
Judge:
Hmm... *sigh*
Leads back to:
"Why was there no picture in the album from the day of the murder?"The Steel Samurai didn't win







Leads to:
"I can think of only one reason, Your Honor."Phoenix:
I can think of only one reason, Your Honor. The Steel Samurai didn't win! That's why Cody deleted those photos.Judge:
You mean the Steel Samurai... lost?Phoenix:
Well, Cody? I'm right, aren't I? Tell the truth. The bad guy defeated the Steel Samurai!Cody:
N-n-n-no way! No! I-it's impossible! Th-the Steel Samurai never loses! He never loses to anyone! Ever!Phoenix:
Your Honor... The witness has revealed everything with his words. There was a reason why he lied and told us he didn't take a picture. The same reason he erased his precious photos! For Cody, it was inconceivable that the Steel Samurai could be defeated. However, Cody witnessed the impossible! He saw the Steel Samurai lose! Yet to admit what he saw would destroy everything he believed in! That's why he lied and said the Steel Samurai won. He couldn't handle the truth!Judge:
O-Order! I will have order! W-witness! I mean, Cody! Is this true!? W-what did you see? Tell the court what you saw!Cody:
I...... Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!Phoenix:
Cody... That day, you saw the Steel Samurai lose a fight. Right?Cody:
Waaaaaaaaaaaaah! Okay okay! Y-you're right! Th-the Steel Samurai f-fell down... Th-then he didn't m-move... Waaaaaaaaah!Judge:
Order! Order! Order!Edgeworth:
What kind of stunt are you trying to pull, Wright!? The Steel Samurai was the murderer, not the victim!Phoenix:
Yet according to your witness's testimony, the Steel Samurai was the one who fell!Judge:
Mr. Wright! What's going on?Phoenix:
Apparently, we have all made a serious error.Edgeworth:
An... error? What's this all about!?Hammer was the victim







Phoenix:
Quite simply, the victim was Jack Hammer!
Judge:
...
Edgeworth:
...
...
Judge:
Umm... Mr. Wright? We all know that.
Phoenix:
Right.
Judge:
Perhaps you'd like to reconsider your last statement?
Phoenix:
... I'm sorry. It was I who was wrong.
Edgeworth:
Okay, Wright! First you're right, now you're wrong!? Which is it!?
Phoenix:
L-look, I'm sure there's something we're overlooking!
Edgeworth:
If you're so sure, then tell us what it is!
Leads back to:
"What's this all about!?"Steel Samurai was the victim







Leads to:
"If you understand what really happened, it's actually quite simple."There was no victim







Phoenix:
There was no victim in this case!
Judge:
Wh-wh-what!? Has the defense taken leave of its senses!?
Phoenix:
Of course, Jack Hammer died. But the Steel Samurai fell too! It was a draw!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
... Sorry. I was too shocked to say anything for a bit there. Listen, Wright! Only one person died in this incident, and that is Jack Hammer! Yet now you claim there "was no victim"? Are you insane?
Phoenix:
(Uh oh, he's pulling out all the stops now.) ... I'm sorry. It was I who was wrong.
Edgeworth:
Okay, Wright! First you're right, now you're wrong!? Which is it!?
Phoenix:
L-look, I'm sure there's something we're overlooking!
Edgeworth:
If you're so sure, then tell us what it is!
Leads back to:
"What's this all about!?"Phoenix:
If you understand what really happened, it's actually quite simple. At the end of the fight, the Steel Samurai fell to the ground, and lay still. In other words, the Steel Samurai was not the killer, he was the victim! Don't you see? Jack Hammer was the Steel Samurai!Judge:
Order! Order! Order! So, the Steel Samurai in this photograph... You're saying the man in this costume was the victim, Mr. Jack Hammer?Phoenix:
That's what I'm saying, Your Honor. Jack Hammer was present at the action scene run-through that morning. Thus, he obviously knew about Will Powers's foot injury.Judge:
B-but wait! Hadn't Mr. Hammer gone to Studio One already?Phoenix:
That's what everyone thought! But remember what Ms. Oldbag said in her testimony?Oldbag:
On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM. Did I see poor old Hammer? Nope. He'd already gone to the studio before I got back to the guard station.Phoenix:
Mr. Jack Hammer left the Employee Area after lunch. However, no one saw him going to Studio One. Nor was there a picture of him. He waited for Mr. Powers to take a nap in his dressing room. Then he snuck into the dressing room and stole the Steel Samurai costume.Judge:
...Edgeworth:
...Judge:
But why would the victim do such a thing?Phoenix:
I... don't know.Cody:
... I get it!Phoenix:
?Cody:
I thought that the Steel Samurai was moving strange. So it was a different person inside the suit! Pops!Phoenix:
Huh, me? What?Cody:
Actually, there was one piece of data I saved.Phoenix:
Data?Cody:
Yeah, a photo on my digital camera!Phoenix:
! W-what!?Edgeworth:
Show us, quick!Cody:
No way man, not if you're gonna look at me like that!Judge:
Now!Cody:
*sniff* Here... This is it.Judge:
... Well, looking at this it's still a little hard to say. I'm afraid that it could be anyone in that costume. Your opinion, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:
I agree, Your Honor. This isn't decisive evidence.Judge:
I'm sorry, this doesn't look like it's the proof we need. I'll give it back.Mia:
Wait, Phoenix!Phoenix:
Mia? What?Mia:
Look at that photo once more! That's it Phoenix! That photo is all the evidence you need to win this trial!Phoenix:
Wh-what!? Y-Your Honor! May I see that photo once more please?Judge:
C-certainly. I don't see why not.Mia:
Phoenix! Show him! There's a glaring, decisive inconsistency with the facts as we know them in that photo!Phoenix:
(Find the inconsistency in the photo!)Present number "2" sign







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Your Honor! Look at this!"Present Steel Samurai







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
It's right here!
Judge:
The Steel Samurai...?
Phoenix:
Yes, that's about the only thing in this picture that could be inconsistent. The Steel Samurai is inconsistent with... something.
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Wright! This is no time for daydreaming and pointless pontification! Think about your client, and us, who are forced to listen to your rambling!
Judge:
Mr. Wright, please rethink your position.
Leads back to:
"Find the inconsistency in the photo!"Present anywhere else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
I think it's here.
Judge:
You seem to be lacking even more confidence than usual.
Phoenix:
I suppose that's because I'm not confident about it at all.
Judge:
Maybe you want to rethink your case, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Yes, please, Your Honor.
Leads back to:
"Find the inconsistency in the photo!"Phoenix:
Your Honor! Look at this!Judge:
I see... a gate?Phoenix:
Might I draw your attention to the number on that gate?Judge:
The number? Ah yes. Well, it's hard to see, but it looks like a "2."Phoenix:
Clearly not a "1," Your Honor, correct?Edgeworth:
Aaaaaah!Phoenix:
I believe Mr. Edgeworth sees what I'm getting at.Edgeworth:
B-but... Th-that's impossible!Judge:
Hmm? Eh? What's this all about? Please explain so that I might be shocked along with the rest of the court.Phoenix:
I'll use the studio guidemap. The body was found here, in Studio One. However, what do we see in this photo taken at the time of the murder? It does NOT say "1" on that gate in the photo. Your Honor! Here is the true scene of the crime! (Show the judge where the murder took place!)Present Studio Two







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Here, at Studio Two."Present anywhere else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
It was here!
Judge:
What does that have to do with the number on the gate in the photograph...?
Phoenix:
Umm... well... Sorry, Your Honor, I guess I hadn't thought it that far through yet.
Judge:
Think it through before you point at the map this time, Mr. Wright! Once again! Where is he scene of this crime?
Leads back to:
"Show the judge where the murder took place!"Phoenix:
Here, at Studio Two.Judge:
I see! That would explain the "2" on the gate in the photo.Phoenix:
Your Honor, I find it very significant that the murder took place in Studio Two!The trailer is there







Phoenix:
As you may recall, there is a trailer in Studio Two. Now, on that day, a meeting was held in that very trailer. There was a break in the meeting corresponding to the time of death. During that break, Mr. Sal Manella and Ms. Dee Vasquez were outside, eating steak. They were at the scene of the crime! The path to the trailer was blocked!
Judge:
So we have heard.
Phoenix:
The path was blocked at 2:15... In other words, the victim went to Studio Two before that time!
Judge:
Yes... yes, I suppose that would be the case.
Phoenix:
Remember Mr. Sal Manella's testimony? Allow me to remind the court: He said no one in the trailer was guilty because they could not have gone to Studio One. Yet, in actuality, the reverse was true! Only someone in the trailer could have committed this murder! They were the only ones with access to the scene of the crime: Studio Two!
Leads to:
"O-order! Order!"The path was blocked







Phoenix:
The path to the trailer was blocked!
Judge:
So we have heard.
Phoenix:
The path was blocked at 2:15... In other words, the victim went to Studio Two before that time!
Judge:
Yes... yes, I suppose that would be the case.
Phoenix:
Remember Mr. Sal Manella's testimony? Allow me to remind the court: He said no one in the trailer was guilty because they could not have gone to Studio One. Yet, in actuality, the reverse was true! Only someone in the trailer could have committed this murder! They were the only ones with access to the scene of the crime: Studio Two! As you may recall, there is a trailer in Studio Two. Now, on that day, a meeting was held in that very trailer. There was a break in the meeting corresponding to the time of death. During that break, Mr. Sal Manella and Ms. Dee Vasquez were outside, eating steak. They were at the scene of the crime!
Leads to:
"O-order! Order!"No filming is done there







Phoenix:
Studio Two is no longer being used for filming!
Judge:
I see... And this is significant... why?
Phoenix:
(Good question! I really should think these things through more.)
Judge:
Would you like to take another stab at it? So to speak?
Phoenix:
S-stabbing away, Your Honor.
Leads back to:
"Your Honor, I find it very significant that the murder took place in Studio Two!"Judge:
O-order! Order!Phoenix:
The defense makes the following claims: The scene of the crime was Studio Two! The person that the security guard, Ms. Oldbag saw was the victim, Mr. Jack Hammer! Mr. Hammer, for some reason, stole a Steel Samurai costume. Then he went to Studio Two!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
This is madness! Jack Hammer is the victim! The victim! Why would he steal a Steel Samurai costume!? Are you suggesting he did so to cover up the details of his own murder!?Phoenix:
W-well, no, of course not...Judge:
Hmm...Edgeworth:
Or do you have proof!? Give me proof that the victim, Jack Hammer, stole the costume!I have proof







Phoenix:
I have proof!
Edgeworth:
Y-you do!?
Judge:
You do, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
(Now that they're so surprised suddenly I'm much less confident... I think I'm right, though!)
Leads to:
"Here's my proof that Jack Hammer stole the costume!"I don't have proof







Phoenix:
(Proof? Uh oh... I'm pretty sure I don't have anything like that...)
Mia:
Phoenix. Even if you're not 100% sure about this, you have to try. And I think you've got proof that's good enough to win them over! Just go for it! All or nothing!
Phoenix:
Your Honor...
Judge:
Yes, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Actually... I do have proof.
Leads to:
"Here's my proof that Jack Hammer stole the costume!"Phoenix:
Here's my proof that Jack Hammer stole the costume!Present Empty Bottle







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"This is it."Present anything else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
(Wait, no, that can't be right... I've got to have some proof that will knock their socks off...)
Judge:
Mr. Wright! We don't have all the time in the world, here.
Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor!
Leads back to:
"Here's my proof that Jack Hammer stole the costume!"Phoenix:
This is it.Judge:
An empty... medicine bottle?Phoenix:
I found this on the table in the Employee Area. The same table where Mr. Hammer and Mr. Powers ate. The label reads "sleeping pills."Judge:
"Sleeping pills"...?Phoenix:
The defendant, Mr. Powers, spent that entire afternoon sleeping. He was drugged... by Mr. Hammer!Judge:
Wait a moment... That bottle does raise some suspicions, yes. But there is no proof that Mr. Hammer used it.Phoenix:
Your Honor, I have an idea.Test Powers's blood







Judge:
An... idea? Continue.
Phoenix:
Run a test of Powers's blood. You should find traces of the sleeping pills.
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
This much time after the day of the murder!? Even if there were traces it still proves nothing! No blood test could tell that Hammer was the one who drugged him, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(He's right. Darn. That didn't work. Time to try another idea.)
Leads back to:
"Your Honor, I have an idea."Fingerprint the bottle







Leads to:
"An... idea? Very well, let's hear it."Examine Hammer's body







Judge:
An idea, Mr. Wright? And that would be?
Phoenix:
Er... we should examine Mr. Hammer's body.
Judge:
Mr. Hammer...? I thought that it was Mr. Powers who was made to take the sleeping pills?

I-indeed it was, Your Honor. (Wrong again...)
Leads back to:
"Your Honor, I have an idea."Judge:
An... idea? Very well, let's hear it.Phoenix:
I want to check this bottle for fingerprints! If my claim is true, Mr. Hammer's fingerprints should show up on this bottle!Edgeworth:
Hmm...Judge:
I suppose you're right. Very well. The court will take possession of the bottle.Empty Bottle given to the judge.Judge:
This court will suspend proceedings on the current trial for today. Cody Hackin's [sic] testimony has revealed new possibilities in this case. In fact, things may have happened very differently than we previously thought. The Steel Samurai seen by Ms. Oldbag may have been the victim, Jack Hammer. The scene of the crime was not Studio One, but Studio Two. And those in the trailer did have time to commit murder. Mr. Wright?Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor?Judge:
Your homework is to find the answer to the following question: Why would Mr. Hammer steal the Steel Samurai costume? Also, who killed him, and why? Find the answers for me by tomorrow.Phoenix:
(That's a lot of homework!)Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth.Edgeworth:
Mm?Judge:
You will need to reconsider your stance in this case. Above all, you will need to reconsider your suspicion of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:
As you say, Your Honor.Judge:
This trial will be extended until tomorrow. This is the last extension! Very well... Court is adjourned!October 19, 2:47 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Phoenix:

We were saved by a hair, but that's all that counts. I thought seriously about going home about three times during the trial.Phoenix:

Hah! Maybe I should take up a career in acting? I was ready to pronounce you dead about three times back there.Mia:

Hoh hoh. Of course, we're kidding.Will:

Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?

Uh... I'm not sure I follow?

It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...

You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled.

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Judge:

Huh? Really?
Judge:
Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
How exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...?
Phoenix:
They aren't, are they...
Judge:
Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
Judge:
... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Ugh, I must be on the wrong track?)Too many penalties







Judge:
That's enough! This court see no reason to further prolong the trial.
Phoenix:
(Uh oh...)
Judge:
This court finds the defendant, Mr. Will Powers...

Guilty

Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!Turnabout Samurai

That was a close one, huh, Mia?Maya:
Really? Too bad, I'm sorry I missed it.Phoenix:
? M-Maya!Maya:
So, what happened?Phoenix:
Well, I think I've got a pretty good idea who did it. Now all I need is a motive... and proof.Maya:
Wow! Good going, Nick!Phoenix:
Under the "initial trial" system, tomorrow is the last day we have.Maya:
"Initial trial"...? What's that?Phoenix:
That's the new court system they introduced two or three years ago. They had so many cases in the system, they decided to speed the whole process up.Maya:
So, under that system, trials have to end in three days?Phoenix:
Yeah, pretty much. Well, we've no time to waste!Talk









The Steel Samurai







Phoenix:
I don't get it, Maya. Why would Mr. Hammer steal the Steel Samurai costume?
Maya:
What!? You mean Mr. Hammer was wearing the costume!?
Phoenix:
Yeah!
Maya:
B-but Mr. Hammer was the victim, Nick! Why would he go through the trouble of stealing it?
Phoenix:
That's what we have to find out.




The director's alibi







Maya:
What happened with the director's testimony?
Phoenix:
Well, it's pretty clear that the producer and the director were both in the trailer.
Maya:
Huh...
Phoenix:
Which means that the killer has to be one of them!
Maya:
Really!? Why?
Phoenix:
Because the real scene of the crime was Studio Two... where that trailer is!
Maya:
Whaaaat!?
Phoenix:
(Hmm... was Maya always this excitable?)




Any ideas







Phoenix:
Well, have you noticed anything that might help us?
Maya:
I can't see what's going on when Mia is here... So, no. I haven't noticed anything.
Phoenix:
Right...
Maya:
Maybe we should go talk to WP?
Phoenix:
(WP... Powers... right.)Present









Powers's(?) Photo







Phoenix:
(Who would have thought that it was Jack Hammer inside! But why did he steal it? That's what I have to figure out.)
Maya:
...?




Samurai Spear







Maya:
I wish I had my own Samurai Spear! Just think, I could poke you as much as I wanted!
Phoenix:
Me!? Why me!?




"Path to Glory"







Phoenix:
What do you think about this? It's that fanboy's prized possession.
Maya:
Wow! Impressive! ... It's a little different from the Steel Samurai on TV...
Phoenix:
These are mostly taken at those PR shows they do at stores and fairs... I'm pretty sure it's not even Will Powers inside that suit.
Maya:
No true fan would be satisfied with anything less than the real thing! He's still a child, I suppose... I guess it takes an adult to appreciate the real deal. Right, Nick?
Phoenix:
Um, yeah, whatever you say.




Cody's Camera







Phoenix:
This is Cody's--
Maya:
Hey! A digital camera! I'm impressed a kid like him would have something this expensive. Kids these days!
Phoenix:
(I don't imagine spirit mediums-in-training get a lot of toys...)October 19Detention CenterVisitor's RoomWill:
Mr. Wright! You did very well again today... Thank you!Phoenix:
Oh... thanks. Um, could you not look like you're about to burst into tears...?Maya:
Wow, Nick! You must have really wowed 'em in there.Phoenix:
And could you wipe that grin off your face? (Changed from [You could stop looking so... vulnerable, too.] in the original release)Maya:
Hey, WP! Only one day left! Let's make it count!Will:
Yes... Though there's not really anything I can do to help.Maya:
Hah hah hah! I'm not really sure what I can do, either.Phoenix:
Please... this is no laughing matter.Talk









Producer Vasquez







Phoenix:
Could you tell me more about Ms. Vasquez?
Will:
Oh... the producer? She's well respected in the industry. They say she's a genius.
Maya:
A genius...?
Will:
She's been at Global Studios for five years now. Right or wrong, nobody dares tell her different these days.
Phoenix:
Why is that?
Will:
Ever since she came on board, we've had nothing but hits. Global Studios was on its knees, but she picked it up and made it shine. Oh, and...
Maya:
And... what?
Will:
N-nothing. Forget it. I... I've only heard rumors, anyhow.




Director Manella







Phoenix:
Can you tell me anything about Mr. Manella?
Will:
Oh, he used to be a minor straight-to-video director. But something in his work caught Vasquez's eye. She brought the Steel Samurai idea to him. Now everyone knows the name Sal Manella. I hear he's pretty much at her beck and call, though. Whenever she says "jump!" he asks "how high?" and all that.
Phoenix:
(I can imagine him being at her beck and call... though I can't imagine him jumping.)




Mr. Hammer







Maya:
I was wondering about Mr. Hammer... He was a big star back in the day, right? But then he just dropped off the face of the Earth.
Will:
Oh... Yes, you're right. In fact, he was my role model when I started in this business. But he just stopped taking on big roles. That's when he began appearing in little productions at Global...
Maya:
How could he do that!? I was really looking forward to a sequel to "Samurai Summer."
Will:
He just gave up being a star five years ago. Actually, now that I think about it... That was right when Ms. Vasquez came to Global.
Phoenix:
(Five years ago...?)Present









Powers's(?) Photo







Phoenix:
Here's that picture again.
Will:
I-is that really Jack Hammer inside that suit?
Phoenix:
He's the only one who it could have been.
Will:
But why would he...?
Maya:
Yeah! Why?
Phoenix:
You're the medium! Why don't you summon up Mr. Hammer's spirit and ask him yourself?
Maya:
*sigh* Gimme about three more years.
Phoenix:
(Look at us, the two novices.)




"Path to Glory"







Phoenix:
Have you seen this, Mr. Powers?
Will:
W-what's that!? I've never seen these Steel Samurais in my life...
Phoenix:
These are the Steel Samurais that appear at live shows. A fanboy collected all these pictures himself.
Will:
... Seeing things like this really makes me think... I mean so much to these kids, you know? *sniff*




Anything else







Will:
E-excuse me. Thank you for showing me that, whatever it is. I wish I could think of some way for me to help you... S-sorry. *sniff*October 19Global StudiosMain GateOldbag:

The old windbag sure is quiet today.Oldbag:

Y-yeah?Maya:
I bet we could even eat those donuts in the guard station... if we wanted.Oldbag:
... You eat, you die.Maya:
Whew! She's alive!Talk









Producer Vasquez







Phoenix:
Um, I was wondering about Dee Vasquez, the producer.
Oldbag:
Oh, the studio bigwigs LOVE her. So she always gets her way.
Phoenix:
(She seems bitter...)
Maya:
Do you... not like the producer?
Oldbag:
Look, the studio people don't want me talking about her, so, sorry.




Director Manella







Phoenix:
Can I ask you about Sal Manella, the director?
Oldbag:
Sal? He's soft--a pushover. Does whatever Vasquez tells him to. She treats him like dirt, but I think he likes it.
Maya:
Huh? Why would anyone like being treated like dirt? That doesn't make any sense, does it, Nick?
Phoenix:
Er... No, no it doesn't, Maya.




Mr. Hammer







Phoenix:
About Mr. Hammer...
Oldbag:
Arrgh! I heard about what you said today! Cheeky whippersnapper! Poor old Hammer! You'd drag his star down from the sky and stomp on it! Calling him a criminal! A thief! I-I-I-I... I won't forget this!!!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh, she's really pissed this time!)
Oldbag:
You listen to me, whippersnapper! My poor old Hammer would never do such a thing! Why would he steal Powers's costume so he could sneak by me? He would never stoop so low! It's impossible!Present









Powers's(?) Photo







Phoenix:
Um, Ms. Oldbag?
Oldbag:
What!? Get that filth out of my sight! And you're claiming that's poor old Hammer in there!? And I thought you were such an innocent youth... Bah!

Phoenix:
Um, Ms. Oldbag? What do you think of this?
Oldbag:
Think? I'm not in the mood for thinking, thank you very much.October 19Studio One EntranceMaya:
Think back, Nick, to the day of the murder... Mr. Hammer put on the Steel Samurai costume. Then he left from here to go to Studio Two...?Phoenix:
Right.Maya:
But why? I wonder if someone called him...? Like the director, or the producer...?Examine









Left path







Phoenix:
Studio Two is down that way. Studio Two... the real scene of the crime.
Maya:
Say, Nick, how did you figure that out again?
Phoenix:
Well... ... Actually, it's a long story, I'll tell you another time.
Maya:
Aww.




Mr. Monkey statue







Phoenix:
The mascot of Global Studios. Apparently its name is "Mr. Monkey."




Security camera







Phoenix:
This security camera takes photos of everyone who comes through the gate. It doesn't seem to be switched on today.




Studio One entrance







Phoenix:
The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body. I don't have that cardkey anymore, so I can't go in there today.




Welcome sign







Maya:
It says "Welcome."
Phoenix:
They let people in here when they're not filming, right?
Maya:
Nick! Let's come here some day! Whaddya say?
Phoenix:
Sure, if Ms. Oldbag lets us in.October 19Studio Two EntranceMaya:

Lunch table







Phoenix:
This is where Sal Manella and Dee Vasquez ate. There's nothing left on the plates.
Maya:
Hey, so they ate t-bone steaks too. ...
Phoenix:
Something wrong?
Maya:
I don't know... I'm getting this funny feeling. Something about this just feels... odd, you know?
Phoenix:
Can't say that I do...




Number "2" sign







Phoenix:
There's a big "2" painted here. So this is the number in Cody's photograph. And to think, if he hadn't brought that photograph in...
Maya:
Don't get all teary eyed yet.




Flower garden







Phoenix:
There're some flowers here.
Maya:
Wow, so pretty! They're taking good care of these.
Phoenix:
Don't get too close. That fence looks dangerous.




Trailer door







Phoenix:
The trailer door. It's locked.Talk









Mr. Hammer







Maya:
Um, excuse me? Mr. Hammer came here on the day of the murder, and...
Vasquez:
Shh.
Maya:
?
Vasquez:
Perhaps you didn't hear me. I'm watching the clouds. I'm not interested in talking to you.
Maya:
Do something, Nick! She's really ticking me off!
Phoenix:
(Oh dear...)




Will Powers







Maya:
Umm... Mr. Powers wasn't the killer! You don't have to cancel the Steel Samurai!
Vasquez:
I think I'm tired of the Steel Samurai.
Maya:
You... you did it! Nick! She did it! She's the killer! My Fey blood speaks to me! I know it! I know it!
Phoenix:
(Oh dear...)




Director Manella







Phoenix:
Um, I was wondering if you could tell me about Mr. Manella?
Vasquez:
... If you must talk about that man... Perhaps you could talk about it in the trailer? By yourselves?
Phoenix:
(Oh, oh dear...)Present

Vasquez:

Phoenix:
(She's not even looking.) Okay. Hey, you look.
Maya:

I guess she was still on a high from getting that rare card she needed.Examine









Left poster







Phoenix:
An old movie poster. "'The Singing Samurai' starring Jack Hammer." What the hell do samurai sing about? Chopping off heads?
Maya:
Oh. My. God. That movie was the best! It's about a samurai who sings his way to fame and fortune! Mr. Hammer was a very accomplished singer, you know.
Phoenix:
Singing samurai stars... What's next? Ninja ballet?October 19Global StudiosEmployee AreaMaya:
I guess they're not filming today, either. I did want to see them filming... just one time.Phoenix:

Wait, are you looking for sleeping pills?Gumshoe:
Yeah, pal. Traces thereof.Examine









Drain grate







Phoenix:
That grate's still lying here.
Maya:
Ah, they've seen wisdom at last! They know if they fixed it I'd just kick it off again.
Phoenix:
That poor assistant...




Lunch table







Phoenix:
The remains of the employees' lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak.




Dressing room door







Phoenix:
The door to the dressing room. It's not locked.




Vending machine







Phoenix:
Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal.Talk









The plate







Maya:
So you're looking for traces of the sleeping pills... how?
Gumshoe:
For a thorough examination I gotta take the plate back to the precinct. But I have the capabilities to make a cursory examination right here! Our science guy gave me some testing solution. This reacts to sleeping pills, see? If there're traces it'll change color.
Maya:
Wow! Neat! Well, Detective Gumshoe? What are you waiting for?
Gumshoe:
Now, now, everything in due time, pal. ... ... ... Well, the testing solution on the plate changed color alright.
Phoenix:
So the food on this plate had been laced with sleeping pills! (Changed from [So there were sleeping pills on the plate!] in the original release)

The investigation







Phoenix:
How goes your investigation?
Gumshoe:
To tell the truth, it's a real mess, pal. Some people think we should pursue the case we already have against Powers... And some people think we should switch suspects!
Maya:
What do you think, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
Well, pal, I hate to admit it... But I'm not sure I buy the case against Mr. Powers any more. I feel kind of bad for Mr. Edgeworth, though.




Prosecutor Edgeworth







Phoenix:
How is Edgeworth doing, anyway?
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth is outta control! (Changed from [Edgeworth is out of control!] in the original release) He was in the waiting room and he crushed this paper cup with hot, hot coffee in it.
Phoenix:
Whoa...
Gumshoe:
Talk about burns, pal!
Maya:
Wow! The fury of Edgeworth!
Phoenix:
Yeah, crushing paper cups... (Cups... bottles...?) Say, what ever happened with that empty bottle?
Gumshoe:
Oh, the bottle of sleeping pills? Well, I got some good news for you about that. They found the victim, Jack Hammer's prints on the bottle.

So that means...
Gumshoe:
Yep, it sounds like the one who put Powers to sleep was none other than... the victim!

You're being very... free with your information today, Detective.
Gumshoe:
Well... don't go telling anyone this, pal. But I was kind of impressed at today's trial, too.
Maya:

Gumshoe:
Most lawyers would've given up after that director's testimony. I think if it'd been anyone but you up there, Powers would be done for by now.




Sleeping Pill Bottle







Phoenix:
Detective, about that bottle...
Gumshoe:
Oh, that? Talk about embarrassing, pal! I can't believe I missed that on my first sweep for evidence. Don't know how I can apologize to Mr. Edgeworth.

Maya:
Well, we can be pretty sure WP did take a nap here, like he said.
Phoenix:
I'm not sure being drugged counts as taking a "nap"...

Mr. Hammer







Phoenix:
I was wondering if I could ask you about Mr. Hammer...
Penny:
Yes?
Phoenix:
On the day of the murder, he went to Studio Two.
Penny:
Huh? I thought he went to Studio One?
Maya:
He stole the Steel Samurai costume, too!
Penny:
What!? Why would Mr. Hammer do something like that? ... Oh... I guess the rumor must be true, then.
Maya:
The rumor?
Penny:
Yeah. Mr. Vasquez, that producer, had some kind of hold on Hammer. She had some dirt on him... He'd do anything she said, apparently.
Maya:
Some "dirt"? What dirt!
Penny:
... Dirt. You know, bad stuff.
Maya:
... Um, I know what dirt means...
Penny:
About five years ago, they were filming a movie starring Mr. Hammer. They were using the new studio... Studio Two. Some sort of accident happened during filming. After that, they never used Studio Two again. They left the film set the way it was, too.
Phoenix:
(The film set...? Was that trailer part of the film set, then?)




The last episode







Maya:
W-what do you mean, the "last Steel Samurai"!?
Penny:
I know it's a shock, but nothing can be done to save it now. Whoever really did kill Mr. Hammer, also signed the Steel Samurai's death warrant.
Maya:
No... no!
Penny:
Also, I hear that Global Studios is going to change its programming. They're not going to make kids' shows anymore.
Maya:
W-what!? Why!?
Penny:
I don't know. It's sad, but that's what Global Studios decided.




Studio policy (appears after "The last episode")







Phoenix:
Why aren't they going to make kids' shows anymore?
Penny:
The studio bigwigs don't want the Steel Samurai around anymore. They want to forget all this ever happened. They want it quiet, you understand?
Maya:
H-how can they just do that! What about all the kids who love the Steel Samurai!
Penny:
It's okay. I'm sure the kids will be fine. They'll find a new hero to follow.
Maya:
No, that can't be true! If the program just ends, they'll be heartbroken for sure! N-Nick! Say something!
Phoenix:
Umm... yeah. (I think evidence, rather than words, is called for here.) Here, take a look at this.

Penny:

Phoenix:
Well, for starters... You can tell me something. Tell me what it is that Global Studios is so intent on hiding? Tell me about this accident five years ago.
Penny:
... Okay!




Five years ago (appears after "Mr. Hammer", before clearing "Studio policy" Talk option)







Phoenix:
An accident five years ago?
Penny:
Yes, in Studio Two. That trailer there was part of the film set.

Well, I can tell you what I've heard. Apparently, five years ago, someone died... and it was Hammer's fault.
Maya:
S-someone died!?
Penny:
It was an accident, of course! Anyway... The producer, Ms. Vasquez managed to hush it up.
Phoenix:
And that's the "dirt" she had on Mr. Hammer?
Maya:
And that's why Mr. Hammer would do anything Ms. Vasquez asked him to do! ... But, it was an accident, right? Why didn't they just make it public?

Well, you know Mr. Hammer was a big star back then. They were afraid about what would happen to his career if word got out.

What's that?
Phoenix:
An empty bottle of sleeping pills. With Mr. Hammer's fingerprints on it...

What, you're still slinking around? If you like the place so much, why don't you take over for me?Maya:
The old windbag doesn't look so good...Oldbag:
E-everybody's doing their darnedest to forget Hammer. Who do they think made Global Studios what it is today? Hammer! It's all due to Hammer!Maya:
She's starting to froth at the mouth, Nick... Maybe we should keep a safe distance?Talk









Five years ago







Phoenix:
Umm... I wanted to ask you about five years ago...
Oldbag:
! Who told!? Who did you hear that from!?
Phoenix:
I, uh... huh?
Oldbag:
Nichols!
Phoenix:
N-nickels?
Maya:
Nichols, Nick. Penny Nichols. That assistant we talked to.
Phoenix:
O-oh, right. Anyway, we heard about the accident. It was during filming with Jack Hammer... He killed a man. Didn't he?
Oldbag:
Wh-whippersnappers! Dredging up dirt on someone's past like that... and the recently departed, no less! I suppose you think this is fun!?
Phoenix:
N-no, I'm just doing my job to protect Mr. Powers...
Oldbag:
And you claim that Hammer stole Powers's costume! You expect me to believe that rubbish!? Or do you have some kind of proof?
Phoenix:
(Proof that Hammer stole Powers's costume? Hmm...)



I have proof







Phoenix:
I'm sorry Ms. Oldbag, but I do have proof. I can prove that Mr. Hammer stole Mr. Powers's costume.



Present Steak Plate







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Mr. Powers ate a t-bone steak for lunch, correct?
Oldbag:
W-well... yes. So?
Phoenix:
This is the plate that he used to eat that steak. There are traces of sleeping pill powder on the plate!
Oldbag:
Mmmph? Hah! I-I bet Powers put it in there himself! Even a lightweight like him must have trouble sleeping sometimes.
Phoenix:
Except, I have proof that Mr. Hammer put the pills in.

Oldbag:
Wh-what does that prove? I... I'm sure old Hammer had some sleepless nights! Where's your proof that he used those pills on Powers?

Okay. You win. I'll talk. I'm tired, see... Tired of holding it all in.Phoenix:
Ms. Oldbag...Oldbag:
You're right. Five years ago there was an accident... a fatal accident. What's worse, a paparazzi took a photo of it. That photo, well, it caused quite a stir. And guess who made it all better? Vasquez! She has ties to the mafia... She silenced that paparazzi. That was the beginning. After that, she became a force to be reckoned with here at the studio.Maya:

Five-Year-Old Photo







Oldbag:
Poor old Hammer. He was a big star. The biggest. That accident five years ago is what did him in. He wanted to hide it. He didn't want anyone to know. Poor, silly old Hammer. If he had just come out and confessed... Then Vasquez wouldn't have gotten her claws into him!Employee AreaMaya:
Detective Gumshoe must have left by now.Phoenix:

O-Old...?Maya:
She means the security lady, Ms. Oldbag, Nick.Phoenix:
Right... anyway... Ms. Vasquez. You hid this incident from the press, didn't you? And you used it to control Mr. Hammer!Vasquez:
... The wind.Phoenix:
The... huh?Vasquez:
It's gotten stronger, don't you think? The wind. ... Your conversation interests me. Let's talk about it more inside the trailer.Maya:
Nick. She went inside the trailer.TrailerVasquez:
Hmph. You came. Well then, what was that you were talking about?Phoenix:
(...! Why is she so eager to talk all of a sudden?) Ms. Vasquez. You were using that accident! You were blackmailing Mr. Hammer so you could control him, weren't you? That's why he was doing kids' shows for petty change!Vasquez:
Hmph... So I'm a blackmailer now?Maya:
Well, that's what it was, wasn't it! I mean, sure, it was an accident... But you used it to drag Mr. Hammer down from his rightful place as a star!Vasquez:
Oh...? I haven't pulled anyone down from anywhere. Mr. Hammer's career went sour of its own accord.Maya:
B-but! You were the cause! You pressured him... And to think it was just an accident...!Vasquez:
Excuse me! What is this all about? You keep saying "accident," "accident"... How are you so sure?Phoenix:
What do you mean?Vasquez:
Must I spell everything out for you? Think: what would it be if it wasn't an accident?Phoenix:
...! No... No way! You mean Mr. Hammer did it... on purpose?Vasquez:
That is what I mean.Phoenix:
Wh-where's your proof! Can you prove it!?Vasquez:
Hmph! Just think! Would he have let me run his life for five years... over a mere accident? And I ran him hard, believe you me!Maya:
B-but, the security lady said it was an accident!Vasquez:
Oh. Well, she was a big fan of Hammer's, you see. She jumped on the reporter who brought that photo into the studio. She wrenched it out of his hands, she did. Gave him a few bruises, too.Phoenix:
(... So that's why she had the photo...)Vasquez:
She's an old fool. Of course, all the reporter would need is the negatives. He could have made a copy. But he didn't. The only copy of that photo is the one you hold. Give it to me. Now.Maya:
W-what? This is valuable evidence!Vasquez:Boys!Phoenix:
... U-umm... Who are they...?Vasquez:
Professionals. They're good at erasing... various things. What do you think...? Would you like to be erased?Phoenix:
Wh-what!?Vasquez:
The trial ends tomorrow? How unfortunate. It's a shame you'll have to miss it!Phoenix:
... Tell me why. Why do you want this photograph so badly? This is Mr. Hammer's "dirt"... no? Why should Dee Vasquez care about it at all?Vasquez:
... I'm sure you'll have plenty of time to think about that where you're going. So long, friends. Boys, erase away.Maya:
Nooooooooooooo!Gumshoe:
Hold it right there! I heard everything, pal! Dee Vasquez! You're coming down to the precinct with me, now!Vasquez:
... Hmph. Not bad. ... Very well. It appears this contest will be decided tomorrow then. In court. I'll be looking forward to it.Gumshoe:
H-hey, you okay, pal? Sorry I was a little late with my entrance. I don't get many chances to practice that sorta thing.Maya:

Part 6October 20, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:
Today will be the final day of this trial. I hope both the prosecution and the defense will be able to present decisive evidence. Very well, Mr. Edgeworth. Your opening statement.Edgeworth:
In yesterday's session, the defense presented us with a new theory for this case. He claims that the scene of the crime was, in fact, Studio Two. Today, I will call on people present in the Studio Two trailer that day. From their testimonies, the truth will become clear.Judge:
Hmm... very well!Phoenix:
(Edgeworth seems a bit on edge today...)Judge:
You may call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth.Edgeworth:
The prosecution calls Ms. Dee Vasquez to the stand. Ms. Dee Vasquez is a producer who was present in the Studio Two trailer that day.Edgeworth:
Will the witness state her name and occupation?Vasquez:
... Dee Vasquez. I am a producer for Global Studios.Edgeworth:
On the day of the murder, you were in the trailer in Studio Two...Vasquez:
As everyone here knows, yes?Edgeworth:
...?Vasquez:
I dislike needless banter. If you must pontificate, do it when I'm not here.Edgeworth:
Mrrph!Judge:
V-very well, Ms. Vasquez. Please give the court your testimony concerning the day of the murder.Maya:
Nick! I know she did it! Make her pay!Phoenix:
R-right! (If she's guilty, I'll catch her with her pants down... So to speak.)Witness Testimony-- The Day of the Murder --Vasquez:
I entered the trailer, oh, a little before noon.
The meeting began at 12:00 sharp. It ended at 4:00.
There was to be a rehearsal afterwards, so we went to Studio One...
I was fatigued, so I had Sal take me.
At 2:30, we took a 15-minute break in the meeting.
Sal and I ate t-bone steaks on the table in front of the trailer.
We found Hammer's body later, when we all went to Studio One.
That's all.Judge:
Hmm... I have a question about one part of your testimony. You were "fatigued" so you had Sal "take" you...?Vasquez:
The van.Judge:
Hmm?Vasquez:
There's a van at Studio Two. I had him take me in that. I thought it might be risky to walk, what with that monkey's head toppling over.Van added to the Court Record.Judge:
I... I see! Very well. Mr. Wright, your cross-examination.Maya:
This is the final battle, Nick! Let's do it!Cross Examination

2025-01-22 14:45:03,612 - INFO - Assistant reply: Alright, let's go through the testimony and see where there might be any contradictions. We have to find out if Dee Vasquez's statements about the day of the murder match up with the evidence we've collected. 

1. **"I entered the trailer, oh, a little before noon."**

   - This part of the testimony doesn't seem to reveal any inconsistencies on its own.

2. **"The meeting began at 12:00 sharp. It ended at 4:00."**

   - We know that the meeting took place and that Dee Vasquez and some other high-level individuals were present. According to the testimony of others, the meeting indeed started at 12:00 PM.

3. **"There was to be a rehearsal afterwards, so we went to Studio One..."**

   - This statement should confirm with the testimonies about rehearsal planning. Check if there is any evidence that contradicts this schedule.

4. **"I was fatigued, so I had Sal take me."**

   - The mention of Sal taking Vasquez due to fatigue could be scrutinized; however, its validity needs to be evaluated against relevant evidence that might indicate otherwise.

5. **"At 2:30, we took a 15-minute break in the meeting."**

   - Remember that 2:30 PM was the time of the victim's death. This break could offer an opportunity for the murder to happen. Important to note here is Vasquez's claim about the location they were during this break.

6. **"Sal and I ate t-bone steaks on the table in front of the trailer."**

   - This statement can be checked against the evidence of missing/varying plates if such evidence was gathered.

7. **"We found Hammer's body later, when we all went to Studio One."**

   - This last part hooks back to when they encountered the body; again, depending on evidences such as movement constraints might be relevant here.

Let's find a direct contradiction, particularly focusing on the timing mentioned in the statements around 2:30 PM when the murder occurred.

### Important Evidence Review:
- **Mr. Monkey's Head**: The path blocked between Studio One and Studio Two; the path was allegedly blocked between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM.
- **Van**: Vasquez claimed Sal drove her, which would accommodate for possible movements during the timeline.

### Potential Contradiction:
The time and location (Studio Two) must be critically examined against the path blocked by Mr. Monkey's head as it aligns with murder timing. Vasquez mentions a 15-minute break but insists they ate during the time when the path should have been blocked—there could be inconsistency if evidence pinpoints their location otherwise.

### Conclusion:
**Present "Mr. Monkey's Head" against the 2:30 PM break statement** to contradict the possibility of accessing between Studio Two and the murder scene at Studio One.

    "response": "To find the contradiction in Cody's testimony, let's analyze his statements and compare them with the evidence we have.\n\n1. Cody states that he found a map on the Internet and visited the studios (Testimony 1).\n2. He mentions he went through the woods to avoid the security lady (Testimony 2).\n3. He was going to the studio but got lost for about 30 minutes (Testimony 4).\n4. Cody saw the Steel Samurai and a fight where the Steel Samurai took down the bad guy (Testimony 6-7).\n5. He regrets not having his camera with him at the time (Testimony 8).\n\nThe key statement to focus on is his regret about not having the camera with him during the fight (Testimony 8). Cody says, \"If I had my camera with me, that woulda been the time for a shot, I tell you.\" However, we know Cody always carries his camera, as evidenced by:\n\n- \"Cody's Camera\" (Evidence 15): \"A new digital camera. Cody always carries it, though he's still learning how to use it.\"\n\nThis contradiction shows Cody likely had his camera during the incident, contradicting his claim of not having it. This implies he might have photographic evidence of what happened and could be withholding important information.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"present\", \"testimony\": 8, \"evidence\": 15}\n```",

    "response": "Let's break down Cody's testimony to identify any potential contradictions with the evidence available. Here is his testimony:\n\n1. \"Yeah, you're right, pops.\"\n2. \"The Steel Samurai had just escaped from the clutches of the villain.\"\n3. \"So I held up my camera to take a picture!\"\n4. \"But the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it.\"\n5. \"Th-that's all that happened. Yup.\"\n\nNow, let's cross-examine Cody's testimony with what we have. In Cody's Camera (evidence #15) description, it mentions that Cody always carries his new digital camera with him, although he's still learning to use it. It suggests he is not entirely familiar with how to operate it, which supports the claim that he missed the shot due to the lens not opening in time.\n\nHowever, let's contrast that with '\"Path to Glory\"' (evidence #14), which contains photos of every victory scene in every battle the Steel Samurai has won. This suggests Cody is likely very efficient at using his camera to capture key moments, contradicting his claim that he missed it due to the camera malfunction. Cody's inconsistencies in saying he had trouble getting the picture while having an album full of perfectly timed action shots need further investigation.\n\nBy pressing on the supposed reasons he missed taking a picture of the crucial moment, we open an avenue to highlight this inconsistency. Considering this, let's present the '\"Path to Glory\"' (evidence #14) against statement 5, \"Th-that's all that happened. Yup\" where Cody claims he missed capturing the moment.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"present\", \"testimony\": 4, \"evidence\": 14}\n```",

    "response": "To find a contradiction in the testimony of the security guard, Wendy Oldbag, let's evaluate her statements and compare them with the evidence available.\n\n1. Oldbag claims she arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM. This matches with other testimonies and the timeline.\n\n2. She mentions that Jack Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through since the morning, which aligns with known facts.\n\n3. She states she was at the main gate from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. The murder happened at 2:30 PM, so she should have seen anyone who passed by.\n\n4. The critical part of her testimony is that she saw someone at 2:00 PM, which she claims was Powers heading toward the studio.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the evidence:\n\n- The time of death according to the Autopsy Report is 2:30 PM, which aligns with her testimony.\n\n- However, there is a significant piece of evidence called \"Powers's(?) Photo.\" This evidence indicates that at 2:00 PM, a person wearing the Steel Samurai costume was captured on camera walking towards the studio. The key detail here is that the person in the costume is dragging one leg, which is a crucial point.\n\n- Will Powers claims he was sleeping in his dressing room at this time, thus he has an alibi. Moreover, the photo provides evidence that the person in the Steel Samurai costume could be someone else other than Powers, considering his reliance on an alibi and the fact he might not have been dragging his leg.\n\nThe discrepancy lies in Oldbag's certainty that it was Will Powers who she saw at 2:00 PM. The photo evidence suggests a possibility that it was not Powers himself, but someone else wearing the costume due to the dragging foot.\n\nThis suggests a contradiction:\n\n- Testimony: \"It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!\" from testimony point 7.\n\n- Evidence contradicting: \"Powers's(?) Photo\" (Evidence #5) shows the person in costume, but it might not be Powers due to the costume's dragging leg, creating reasonable doubt.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"present\", \"testimony\": 7, \"evidence\": 5}\n```",

    "response": "To find the contradiction in the witness's testimony, let's analyze the statements and the evidence:\n\n1. **Testimony**: The witness claims the time of death was 2:30 PM.\n2. **Testimony**: The only person they saw before then was Will Powers.\n3. **Testimony**: No one else went to the studio.\n4. **Testimony**: If someone else had gone there, they would have seen them.\n\nLet's compare this with the evidence that we have:\n\n- **Jack's Autopsy Report**: Confirms the time of death as 2:30 PM.\n- **Powers's(?) Photo**: The photo shows the Steel Samurai walking, dragging one leg. The timestamp is 2:00 PM, Photo #2.\n- **Mr. Monkey's Head**: Indicates that the path to the crime scene was blocked from 2:15 PM to 4:00 PM.\n\nFrom this, we see a potential contradiction with statement 3 (\"No one else went there!\") and the evidence regarding **Mr. Monkey's Head**. If the path was blocked from 2:15 PM to 4:00 PM, it would have been difficult for anyone to access the studio during that timeframe, suggesting that the witness's statement that no one else went there doesn't account for this blockage. \n\nThus, evidence #11, Mr. Monkey's Head, could be leveraging this contradiction for the statement that nobody else could have gone to the studio because the path was obstructed during a crucial time period following their stated time of becoming aware of Powers entering at 2:00 PM.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"present\",\n  \"testimony\": 2,\n  \"evidence\": 11\n}\n```",

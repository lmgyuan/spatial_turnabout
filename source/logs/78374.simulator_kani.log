The court is now in session for the trial of Ms. Maya Fey.Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor. (Miles Edgeworth... I'd better not show any signs of weakness today, or he'll be on me in an instant.)Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth. Please give the court your opening statement.Edgeworth:
Thank you, Your Honor. The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, was at the scene of the crime. The prosecution has evidence she committed this murder... and we have a witness who saw her do it. The prosecution sees no reason to doubt the facts of this case, Your Honor.Judge:
I see. Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Let's begin then.Edgeworth:
If we may call our first witness, Your Honor. (Changed from [You may call your first witness.] in the original release) The prosecution calls the chief officer at the scene, Detective Gumshoe!Edgeworth:
Witness, please state your name and profession to the court.Gumshoe:
Sir! My name's Dick Gumshoe, sir! I'm the detective in charge of homicides down at the precinct, sir!Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe. Please, describe for us the details of this murder.Gumshoe:
Very well, sir! Let me use this floor map of the office to explain. The body was found by this window, here.Edgeworth:
And the cause of death?Gumshoe:
Loss of blood due to being struck by a blunt object, sir! The murder weapon was a statue of "The Thinker" found next to the body, sir! It was heavy enough to be a deadly weapon, even in a girl's hands, sir!Judge:
The court accepts the statue as evidence.Phoenix:
(They're still calling it a "statue"...)Floor Plans added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:
Now, Detective...Gumshoe:
Y-yes sir!Edgeworth:
You immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey, who was found at the scene, correct? Can you tell me why?Gumshoe:
Yes sir! I had hard evidence she did it, sir!Judge:
Hmm. Detective Gumshoe. Please testify to the court about this "hard evidence."Witness Testimony-- Maya Fey's Arrest --Gumshoe:
As soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!
There were two people there already:
The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.
I immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey!
Why? We had a witness account describing her!
The witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder!Judge:
Hmm... The very moment, you say. Very well. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor. (Cross-examine what...? I couldn't see a single contradiction in that testimony...)...whoosh...SMACK!Phoenix:
(Hey! Maya just threw something at me... What's this? "When my sister couldn't find any contradictions in a witness's testimony she would bluff it and press the witness on every detail! The witness always slips up and says something wrong... It worked lots of times!" Heh... I should have expected Maya would know some of her sister's tricks! Alright. Let's give this a try!)Judge:
Something the matter?Phoenix:
No, Your Honor. I'd like to begin my cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Maya Fey's Arrest --Gumshoe:

(Hmm... okay, I pressed. Not sure it did much, though.) Right. Please continue.Gumshoe:
There were two people there already:Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe, how long would you say it took, between you receiving the call, and your arrival at the scene of the crime?
Gumshoe:
Hmm, right... I'd say it was about 3 minutes!
Phoenix:
Th-that's pretty fast!
Gumshoe:
Our motto this month is "quick response"! That's how I got there before the killer got away!
Edgeworth:
Indeed! So, tell us who the two people you found on the scene were.
Gumshoe:
Yes sir!Gumshoe:
The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.Press

If I heard correctly... You said you arrested her because you had "hard evidence" she did it, correct?Gumshoe:
Huh? Did... did I say that? Me?Phoenix:
I heard you say it!Judge:
You did say it.Edgeworth:
You said it.Phoenix:
Exactly what about this suspicious woman in pink's claim was "hard evidence"!?Gumshoe:
Wh-what!? Miss May isn't suspicious, and she sure isn't pink, pal! W-well, I guess she is pink...Judge:
That's enough, Detective Gumshoe. Do you have any more solid proof other than her claims, Detective?Gumshoe:
Umm...Phoenix:
(Hmm! I guess pressing can have its advantages!)Gumshoe:
... Yes.Phoenix:

Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!
How you like that? That's my "hard evidence"!Judge:

Y-Your Honor?Judge:
Why didn't you testify about this vital piece of evidence the first time!?Gumshoe:

The court is now in session for the trial of Ms. Maya Fey.Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor. (Miles Edgeworth... I'd better not show any signs of weakness today, or he'll be on me in an instant.)Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth. Please give the court your opening statement.Edgeworth:
Thank you, Your Honor. The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, was at the scene of the crime. The prosecution has evidence she committed this murder... and we have a witness who saw her do it. The prosecution sees no reason to doubt the facts of this case, Your Honor.Judge:
I see. Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Let's begin then.Edgeworth:
If we may call our first witness, Your Honor. (Changed from [You may call your first witness.] in the original release) The prosecution calls the chief officer at the scene, Detective Gumshoe!Edgeworth:
Witness, please state your name and profession to the court.Gumshoe:
Sir! My name's Dick Gumshoe, sir! I'm the detective in charge of homicides down at the precinct, sir!Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe. Please, describe for us the details of this murder.Gumshoe:
Very well, sir! Let me use this floor map of the office to explain. The body was found by this window, here.Edgeworth:
And the cause of death?Gumshoe:
Loss of blood due to being struck by a blunt object, sir! The murder weapon was a statue of "The Thinker" found next to the body, sir! It was heavy enough to be a deadly weapon, even in a girl's hands, sir!Judge:
The court accepts the statue as evidence.Phoenix:
(They're still calling it a "statue"...)Floor Plans added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:
Now, Detective...Gumshoe:
Y-yes sir!Edgeworth:
You immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey, who was found at the scene, correct? Can you tell me why?Gumshoe:
Yes sir! I had hard evidence she did it, sir!Judge:
Hmm. Detective Gumshoe. Please testify to the court about this "hard evidence."Witness Testimony-- Maya Fey's Arrest --Gumshoe:
As soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!
There were two people there already:
The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.
I immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey!
Why? We had a witness account describing her!
The witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder!Judge:
Hmm... The very moment, you say. Very well. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor. (Cross-examine what...? I couldn't see a single contradiction in that testimony...)...whoosh...SMACK!Phoenix:
(Hey! Maya just threw something at me... What's this? "When my sister couldn't find any contradictions in a witness's testimony she would bluff it and press the witness on every detail! The witness always slips up and says something wrong... It worked lots of times!" Heh... I should have expected Maya would know some of her sister's tricks! Alright. Let's give this a try!)Judge:
Something the matter?Phoenix:
No, Your Honor. I'd like to begin my cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Maya Fey's Arrest --Gumshoe:

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Who did you say you got a call from?
Gumshoe:
Hey pal, don't play dumb! You know who! The call was from a customer at the Gatewater Hotel, right across from the crime scene!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... okay, I pressed. Not sure it did much, though.) Right. Please continue.Gumshoe:
There were two people there already:Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe, how long would you say it took, between you receiving the call, and your arrival at the scene of the crime?
Gumshoe:
Hmm, right... I'd say it was about 3 minutes!
Phoenix:
Th-that's pretty fast!
Gumshoe:
Our motto this month is "quick response"! That's how I got there before the killer got away!
Edgeworth:
Indeed! So, tell us who the two people you found on the scene were.
Gumshoe:
Yes sir!Gumshoe:
The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Are you absolutely sure it was us?
Gumshoe:
Listen pal, your dumb act will only get you so far! With her funky hippie clothes and your spiky hair? You two stand out like... like suspicious people at a crime scene!
Phoenix:
(Well... he does have a point about her. She is pretty unmistakable. I should pick my points to press with a little more care...)Gumshoe:
I immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey!Press

Y-yeah?Phoenix:
If I heard correctly... You said you arrested her because you had "hard evidence" she did it, correct?Gumshoe:
Huh? Did... did I say that? Me?Phoenix:
I heard you say it!Judge:
You did say it.Edgeworth:
You said it.Phoenix:
Exactly what about this suspicious woman in pink's claim was "hard evidence"!?Gumshoe:
Wh-what!? Miss May isn't suspicious, and she sure isn't pink, pal! W-well, I guess she is pink...Judge:
That's enough, Detective Gumshoe. Do you have any more solid proof other than her claims, Detective?Gumshoe:
Umm...Phoenix:
(Hmm! I guess pressing can have its advantages!)Gumshoe:
... Yes.Phoenix:
(Gah!)Gumshoe:
Sorry, I got the order of things mixed up in my testimony, Your Honor Sir! There was something I should have told you about first, Your Honor!Judge:
Very well, Detective. Let's hear your testimony again.Witness Testimony-- Hard Evidence --Gumshoe:

The court is now in session for the trial of Ms. Maya Fey.Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor. (Miles Edgeworth... I'd better not show any signs of weakness today, or he'll be on me in an instant.)Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth. Please give the court your opening statement.Edgeworth:
Thank you, Your Honor. The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, was at the scene of the crime. The prosecution has evidence she committed this murder... and we have a witness who saw her do it. The prosecution sees no reason to doubt the facts of this case, Your Honor.Judge:
I see. Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Let's begin then.Edgeworth:
If we may call our first witness, Your Honor. (Changed from [You may call your first witness.] in the original release) The prosecution calls the chief officer at the scene, Detective Gumshoe!Edgeworth:
Witness, please state your name and profession to the court.Gumshoe:
Sir! My name's Dick Gumshoe, sir! I'm the detective in charge of homicides down at the precinct, sir!Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe. Please, describe for us the details of this murder.Gumshoe:
Very well, sir! Let me use this floor map of the office to explain. The body was found by this window, here.Edgeworth:
And the cause of death?Gumshoe:
Loss of blood due to being struck by a blunt object, sir! The murder weapon was a statue of "The Thinker" found next to the body, sir! It was heavy enough to be a deadly weapon, even in a girl's hands, sir!Judge:
The court accepts the statue as evidence.Phoenix:
(They're still calling it a "statue"...)Floor Plans added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:
Now, Detective...Gumshoe:
Y-yes sir!Edgeworth:
You immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey, who was found at the scene, correct? Can you tell me why?Gumshoe:
Yes sir! I had hard evidence she did it, sir!Judge:
Hmm. Detective Gumshoe. Please testify to the court about this "hard evidence."Witness Testimony-- Maya Fey's Arrest --Gumshoe:
As soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!
There were two people there already:
The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.
I immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey!
Why? We had a witness account describing her!
The witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder!Judge:
Hmm... The very moment, you say. Very well. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor. (Cross-examine what...? I couldn't see a single contradiction in that testimony...)...whoosh...SMACK!Phoenix:
(Hey! Maya just threw something at me... What's this? "When my sister couldn't find any contradictions in a witness's testimony she would bluff it and press the witness on every detail! The witness always slips up and says something wrong... It worked lots of times!" Heh... I should have expected Maya would know some of her sister's tricks! Alright. Let's give this a try!)Judge:
Something the matter?Phoenix:
No, Your Honor. I'd like to begin my cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Maya Fey's Arrest --Gumshoe:

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Who did you say you got a call from?
Gumshoe:
Hey pal, don't play dumb! You know who! The call was from a customer at the Gatewater Hotel, right across from the crime scene!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... okay, I pressed. Not sure it did much, though.) Right. Please continue.Gumshoe:
There were two people there already:Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe, how long would you say it took, between you receiving the call, and your arrival at the scene of the crime?
Gumshoe:
Hmm, right... I'd say it was about 3 minutes!
Phoenix:
Th-that's pretty fast!
Gumshoe:
Our motto this month is "quick response"! That's how I got there before the killer got away!
Edgeworth:
Indeed! So, tell us who the two people you found on the scene were.
Gumshoe:
Yes sir!Gumshoe:
The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, and the lawyer, Mr. Phoenix Wright.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Are you absolutely sure it was us?

Listen pal, your dumb act will only get you so far! With her funky hippie clothes and your spiky hair? You two stand out like... like suspicious people at a crime scene!

Y-yeah?Phoenix:
If I heard correctly... You said you arrested her because you had "hard evidence" she did it, correct?Gumshoe:
Huh? Did... did I say that? Me?Phoenix:
I heard you say it!Judge:
You did say it.Edgeworth:
You said it.Phoenix:
Exactly what about this suspicious woman in pink's claim was "hard evidence"!?Gumshoe:
Wh-what!? Miss May isn't suspicious, and she sure isn't pink, pal! W-well, I guess she is pink...Judge:
That's enough, Detective Gumshoe. Do you have any more solid proof other than her claims, Detective?Gumshoe:
Umm...Phoenix:
(Hmm! I guess pressing can have its advantages!)Gumshoe:
... Yes.Phoenix:

The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor. (Miles Edgeworth... I'd better not show any signs of weakness today, or he'll be on me in an instant.)Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth. Please give the court your opening statement.Edgeworth:
Thank you, Your Honor. The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, was at the scene of the crime. The prosecution has evidence she committed this murder... and we have a witness who saw her do it. The prosecution sees no reason to doubt the facts of this case, Your Honor.Judge:

Detective Gumshoe. Please, describe for us the details of this murder.Gumshoe:
Very well, sir! Let me use this floor map of the office to explain. The body was found by this window, here.Edgeworth:
And the cause of death?Gumshoe:
Loss of blood due to being struck by a blunt object, sir! The murder weapon was a statue of "The Thinker" found next to the body, sir! It was heavy enough to be a deadly weapon, even in a girl's hands, sir!Judge:
The court accepts the statue as evidence.Phoenix:
(They're still calling it a "statue"...)Floor Plans added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:
Now, Detective...Gumshoe:
Y-yes sir!Edgeworth:
You immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey, who was found at the scene, correct? Can you tell me why?Gumshoe:
Yes sir! I had hard evidence she did it, sir!Judge:
Hmm. Detective Gumshoe. Please testify to the court about this "hard evidence."Witness Testimony-- Maya Fey's Arrest --Gumshoe:

The witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder!Judge:
Hmm... The very moment, you say. Very well. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor. (Cross-examine what...? I couldn't see a single contradiction in that testimony...)...whoosh...SMACK!Phoenix:
(Hey! Maya just threw something at me... What's this? "When my sister couldn't find any contradictions in a witness's testimony she would bluff it and press the witness on every detail! The witness always slips up and says something wrong... It worked lots of times!" Heh... I should have expected Maya would know some of her sister's tricks! Alright. Let's give this a try!)Judge:

Mr. Edgeworth. Please give the court your opening statement.Edgeworth:
Thank you, Your Honor. The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, was at the scene of the crime. The prosecution has evidence she committed this murder... and we have a witness who saw her do it. The prosecution sees no reason to doubt the facts of this case, Your Honor.Judge:

Detective Gumshoe. Please, describe for us the details of this murder.Gumshoe:
Very well, sir! Let me use this floor map of the office to explain. The body was found by this window, here.Edgeworth:
And the cause of death?Gumshoe:
Loss of blood due to being struck by a blunt object, sir! The murder weapon was a statue of "The Thinker" found next to the body, sir! It was heavy enough to be a deadly weapon, even in a girl's hands, sir!Judge:
The court accepts the statue as evidence.Phoenix:
(They're still calling it a "statue"...)Floor Plans added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:
Now, Detective...Gumshoe:

Yes sir! I had hard evidence she did it, sir!Judge:
Hmm. Detective Gumshoe. Please testify to the court about this "hard evidence."Witness Testimony-- Maya Fey's Arrest --Gumshoe:

Y-yes, Your Honor. (Cross-examine what...? I couldn't see a single contradiction in that testimony...)...whoosh...SMACK!Phoenix:

The witness always slips up and says something wrong... It worked lots of times!" Heh... I should have expected Maya would know some of her sister's tricks! Alright. Let's give this a try!)Judge:

Detective Gumshoe, how long would you say it took, between you receiving the call, and your arrival at the scene of the crime?

Hmm, right... I'd say it was about 3 minutes!

Th-that's pretty fast!
Gumshoe:
Our motto this month is "quick response"! That's how I got there before the killer got away!

Indeed! So, tell us who the two people you found on the scene were.

Also, there was blood found on the victim's finger!

How you like that? That's my "hard evidence"!Judge:
Hmm... Before we begin cross-examination, I have a question for you, Detective.Gumshoe:
Y-Your Honor?Judge:
Why didn't you testify about this vital piece of evidence the first time!?Gumshoe:

The court is now in session for the trial of Ms. Maya Fey.Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor. (Miles Edgeworth... I'd better not show any signs of weakness today, or he'll be on me in an instant.)Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth. Please give the court your opening statement.Edgeworth:
Thank you, Your Honor. The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, was at the scene of the crime. The prosecution has evidence she committed this murder... and we have a witness who saw her do it. The prosecution sees no reason to doubt the facts of this case, Your Honor.Judge:
I see. Thank you, Mr. Edgeworth. Let's begin then.Edgeworth:
If we may call our first witness, Your Honor. (Changed from [You may call your first witness.] in the original release) The prosecution calls the chief officer at the scene, Detective Gumshoe!Edgeworth:
Witness, please state your name and profession to the court.Gumshoe:
Sir! My name's Dick Gumshoe, sir! I'm the detective in charge of homicides down at the precinct, sir!Edgeworth:
Detective Gumshoe. Please, describe for us the details of this murder.Gumshoe:
Very well, sir! Let me use this floor map of the office to explain. The body was found by this window, here.Edgeworth:
And the cause of death?Gumshoe:
Loss of blood due to being struck by a blunt object, sir! The murder weapon was a statue of "The Thinker" found next to the body, sir! It was heavy enough to be a deadly weapon, even in a girl's hands, sir!Judge:
The court accepts the statue as evidence.Phoenix:
(They're still calling it a "statue"...)Floor Plans added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:
Now, Detective...Gumshoe:
Y-yes sir!Edgeworth:
You immediately arrested Ms. Maya Fey, who was found at the scene, correct? Can you tell me why?Gumshoe:
Yes sir! I had hard evidence she did it, sir!Judge:
Hmm. Detective Gumshoe. Please testify to the court about this "hard evidence."Witness Testimony-- Maya Fey's Arrest --Gumshoe:
As soon as the phone call came in, I rushed to the scene!

Why? We had a witness account describing her!
The witness saw Ms. Maya Fey at the very moment of the murder!Judge:
Hmm... The very moment, you say. Very well. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor. (Cross-examine what...? I couldn't see a single contradiction in that testimony...)...whoosh...SMACK!Phoenix:
(Hey! Maya just threw something at me... What's this? "When my sister couldn't find any contradictions in a witness's testimony she would bluff it and press the witness on every detail! The witness always slips up and says something wrong... It worked lots of times!" Heh... I should have expected Maya would know some of her sister's tricks! Alright. Let's give this a try!)Judge:
Something the matter?Phoenix:
No, Your Honor. I'd like to begin my cross-examination.Cross Examination-- Maya Fey's Arrest --Gumshoe:

Also, there was blood found on the victim's finger!

The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor. (Miles Edgeworth... I'd better not show any signs of weakness today, or he'll be on me in an instant.)Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth. Please give the court your opening statement.Edgeworth:
Thank you, Your Honor. The defendant, Ms. Maya Fey, was at the scene of the crime. The prosecution has evidence she committed this murder... and we have a witness who saw her do it. The prosecution sees no reason to doubt the facts of this case, Your Honor.Judge:

Very well, sir! Let me use this floor map of the office to explain. The body was found by this window, here.Edgeworth:
And the cause of death?Gumshoe:
Loss of blood due to being struck by a blunt object, sir! The murder weapon was a statue of "The Thinker" found next to the body, sir! It was heavy enough to be a deadly weapon, even in a girl's hands, sir!Judge:
The court accepts the statue as evidence.Phoenix:

On the 9th of September, 2001, the body of Mia Fey, the Chief Attorney of Fey & Co. Law Offices, was found in her office. She had been hit on the head by a clock in the form of a statue, killing her instantly. Maya Fey, Mia's little sister, was found at the scene. Her clothes were covered in blood, and she was crying over her sister's body.
Maya was arrested on the spot.
In the days leading up to the murder, Mia had been investigating the DL-6 Incident, a series of events that had occurred 11 years earlier. A young girl had been murdered by a mysterious man called Redd White, and Mia was the attorney on the case. The case had never been solved, and Mia had been haunted by it ever since.
On the night of the murder, Maya was supposed to meet with Mia at the Gatewater Hotel. However, Maya had been called

The following is the context of the case that you may find useful in helping you make decision:

The defense attorney, Phoenix Wright, was visiting the Fey & Co. Law Offices when the Chief Attorney, Mia Fey, was killed. He was in the middle of a conversation with Maya Fey, Mia's little sister, when he heard a loud thud from the reception area. The two ran over to find Mia's body on the floor. The only other person in the room was an acquaintance of Mia's named April May, a spirit medium who was visiting from the United States.
As Maya and Phoenix were discussing the events, Maya received a call from a hotel bellboy, who said that there was a woman claiming to be a witness to the murder. The bellboy said that he was bringing her over to the Fey & Co. Law Offices. The witness, April May, arrived shortly thereafter. Maya and Phoenix explained that the Chief Attorney had been killed, and April May

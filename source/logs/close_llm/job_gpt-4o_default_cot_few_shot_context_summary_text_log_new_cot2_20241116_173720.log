Well, I have to say Phoenix, I\'m impressed! Not everyone takes on a murder trial right off the bat like this. It says a lot about you... and your client as well.Phoenix:\nUm... thanks. Actually, it\'s because I owe him a favor.Mia:\nA favor? You mean, you knew the defendant before this case?Phoenix:\nYes. Actually, I kind of owe my current job to him. He\'s one of the reasons I became an attorney.Mia:\nWell, that\'s news to me!Phoenix:\nI want to help him out any way I can! I just... really want to help him. I owe him that much.???:\n(It\'s over!

Tell them I\'m guilty!!! Gimme the death sentence! I ain\'t afraid to die!Phoenix:\nWhat!? What\'s wrong, Larry?Butz:\nOh, it\'s all over... I... I\'m finished. Finished! I can\'t live in a world without her! I can\'t! Who... who took her away from me, Nick? Who did this!? Aww, Nick, ya gotta tell me! Who took my baby away!?Phoenix:\n(Hmm... The person responsible for your girlfriend\'s death? The newspapers say it was you...)Phoenix:\nMy name is Phoenix Wright. Here\'s the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: "When something smells, it\'s usually the Butz." In the 23 years I\'ve known him, it\'s usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it\'s usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he\'s a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that\'s just what I\'m going to do!August 3, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz. (Changed from [The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.] in the original release)Payne:\nThe prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:\nThe, um, defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:\nAhem. Mr. Wright? This is your first trial, is it not?Phoenix:\nY-Yes, Your Honor. I\'m, um, a little nervous.Judge:\nYour conduct during this trial will decide the fate of your client. Murder is a serious charge. For your client\'s sake, I hope you can control your nerves.Phoenix:\nThank... thank you, Your Honor.Judge:\n... Mr. Wright, given the circumstances... I think we should have a test to ascertain your readiness.Phoenix:\nYes, Your Honor. (Gulp... Hands shaking... Eyesight... fading...)Judge:\nThis test will consist of a few simple questions. Answer them clearly and concisely. Please state the name of the defendant in this case.Phoenix Wright\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... the defendant... is me... right? (Changed from [Um... the defendant... is me, right?] in the original release)\nMia:\nWright! Have you completely lost your mind? Focus! The defendant is the person on trial! You\'re his lawyer!\nPhoenix:\nUm, er, eh? Oh yeah, right! Eh heh heh.\nMia:\nThis is no laughing matter! You did pass the bar, didn\'t you?\nJudge:\nSorry, I couldn\'t hear your answer. I\'ll ask once more:\nLeads back to:\n"Please state the name of the defendant in this case."Larry Butz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n"The defendant? Well, that\'s Larry Butz, Your Honor."Mia Fey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nThe, um, defendant? That\'s... er... Mia Fey?\nMia:\nWrong, Wright. Look, I have to leave. I have to go home. I\'m... I\'m expecting a delivery.\nPhoenix:\nAw, c\'mon Chief. There\'s no need to be going so soon, is there?\nMia:\nListen, Wright! (Changed from [Wright!] in the original release) The defendant is the one on trial--your client! (Changed from [Listen: the defendant is the one on trial--your client!] in the original release) I mean, that\'s about as basic as you can get!\nPhoenix:\n(I\'ve put my foot in it this time! I\'ve got to relax!)\nJudge:\nSorry, I couldn\'t hear your answer. I\'ll ask once more:\nLeads back to:\n"Please state the name of the defendant in this case."Phoenix:\nThe defendant? Well, that\'s Larry Butz, Your Honor.Judge:\nCorrect. Just keep your wits about you and you\'ll do fine. Next question: This is a murder trial. Tell me, what\'s the victim\'s name?Phoenix:\n(Whew, I know this one! Glad I read the case report cover to cover so many times. It\'s... wait... Uh-oh! No... no way! I forgot! I\'m drawing a total blank here!)Mia:\nPhoenix! Are you absolutely SURE you\'re up to this? You don\'t even know the victim\'s name!?Phoenix:\nOh, the victim! O-Of course I know the victim\'s name! I, um, just forgot. ...Temporarily (Changed from [I, um, just forgot. ... Temporarily.] in the original release)Mia:\nI think I feel a migraine coming on. Look, the victim\'s name is listed in the Court Record. Just press [the R Button / Tab] to check it at any time, okay? (Changed from [Just touch the Court Record button to check it at any time, okay?] in the original release) Remember to check it often. Do it for me, please. I\'m begging you.Judge:\nMr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?Mia Fey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... Mia Fey?\nMia:\nW-W-What!? How can I be the victim!?\nPhoenix:\nOh! Right! Sorry! I, er, it was the first name that popped into my head, and--\nMia:\nThe Court Record button! Remember to use it when you\'re in a pinch with [the R Button / Tab]. (Changed from [Remember to use it when you\'re in a pinch.] in the original release)\nJudge:\nLet me ask that one again:\nLeads back to:\n"Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?"Cinder Block\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOh, um, wasn\'t it Ms. Block? Ms. Cinder Block?\nJudge:\nThe person in question was a victim of murder, not ill-conceived naming, Mr. Wright.\nMia:\nWright? If you forget something, use [the R Button / Tab] to check the Court Record and jog your memory. (Changed from [If you forget something, [just touch the Court Record button to help you remember.] in the original release) A mistake in court could cost you the case.\nJudge:\nI\'ll ask you again:\nLeads back to:\n"Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?"Cindy Stone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n"Um... the victim\'s name is Cindy Stone."Phoenix:\nUm... the victim\'s name is Cindy Stone.Judge:\nCorrect. Now, tell me, what was the cause of death? She died because she was...?Poisoned\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOh, right! Wasn\'t she, um, poisoned by er... poison?\nJudge:\nYou\'re asking me!?\nPhoenix:\nUm... Chief! Help me out!\nMia:\nCheck the court record. [The R Button / Tab]... remember? (Changed from [Check the court record. The Court Record button... remember?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Geez. Give a guy a break!)\nJudge:\nLet me ask again.\nLeads back to:\n"She died because she was...?"Hit with a blunt object\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n"She was struck once, by a blunt object."Strangled\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nRight... she was strangled, wasn\'t she?\nMia:\nPlease tell me that was you talking to yourself.\nJudge:\nIf you wish to hang yourself, Mr. Wright, you\'re welcome to, but not inside my courtroom. I suppose there\'s nothing to do but give you another try:\nLeads back to:\n"She died because she was...?"Phoenix:\nShe was struck once, by a blunt object.Judge:\nCorrect. You\'ve answered all my questions. I see no reason why we shouldn\'t proceed. You seem much more relaxed, Mr. Wright. Good for you.Phoenix:\nThank you, Your Honor. (Because I don\'t FEEL relaxed, that\'s for sure.)Judge:\nWell, then... First, a question for the prosecution. Mr. Payne?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nAs Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to the court just what that "object" was?Payne:\nThe murder weapon was this statue of "The Thinker." It was found lying on the floor, next to the victim.Judge:\nI see... The court accepts it into evidence. (Changed from [I see... the court accepts it into evidence.] in the original release)Statue added to the Court Record.Mia:\nWright... Be sure to pay attention to any evidence added during the trial. That evidence is the only ammunition you have in court. [Touch the Court Record button / Use the R Button] to check the Court Record frequently.Judge:\nMr. Payne, the prosecution may call its first witness.Payne:\nThe prosecution calls the defendant, Mr. Butz, to the stand.Phoenix:\nUm, Chief, what do I do now?Mia:\nPay attention. You don\'t want to miss any information that might help your client\'s case. You\'ll get your chance to respond to the prosecution later, so be ready! Let\'s just hope he doesn\'t say anything... unfortunate.Phoenix:\n(Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... This could be bad.) (Changed from [Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... this could be bad.] in the original release)Payne:\nAhem. Mr. Butz. Is it not true that the victim had recently dumped you?Butz:\nHey, watch it buddy! We were great together! We were Romeo and Juliet, Cleopatra and Mark Anthony!Phoenix:\n(Um... didn\'t they all die?)Butz:\nI wasn\'t dumped! She just wasn\'t taking my phone calls. Or seeing me... Ever. WHAT\'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?Payne:\nMr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by "dumped." In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!Butz:\nWhaddya mean, "one of them"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don\'t believe a word of it!Payne:\nYour Honor, the victim\'s passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.Passport added to the Court Record.Judge:\nHmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.Butz:\nDude... no way...Payne:\nThe victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several "Sugar Daddies."Butz:\nDaddies? Sugar?Payne:\nYes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.Butz:\nDuuude!Payne:\nWe can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?Mia:\nWright... I don\'t think you want him to answer that question.Phoenix:\n(Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)Wait and see what happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Might be better not to get involved in this one...)\nPayne:\nWell, Mr. Butz?\nButz:\nDude, no way! That cheatin\' she-dog!\nLeads to:\n"I\'m gonna die. I\'m just gonna drop dead!"Stop him from answering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMy client had no idea the victim was seeing other men! That question is irrelevant to this case!\nPayne:\nOof! *wince*\nButz:\nDude! Nick! Whaddya mean, "irrelevant"!? That cheatin\' she-dog!\nLeads to:\n"I\'m gonna die. I\'m just gonna drop dead!"Butz:\nI\'m gonna die. I\'m just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I\'m going to get to the bottom of this!Judge:\nLet\'s continue with the trial, shall we?Payne:\nI believe the accused\'s motive is clear to everyone.Judge:\nYes, quite.Phoenix:\n(Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)Payne:\nNext question! You went to the victim\'s apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?Butz:\nGulp!Payne:\nWell, did you, or did you not?Butz:\nHeh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn\'t!Phoenix:\n(Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)Have him answer honestly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I know! I\'ll send him a signal...)\n\n(TELL THE TRUTH)\n\nButz:\nEr... Yeah! Yeah! I was there! I went!\nJudge:\nOrder! Well, Mr. Butz?\nButz:\nDude, chill! She wasn\'t home, man... So, like, I didn\'t see her.\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nYour Honor, the defendant is lying.\nJudge:\nLying?\nPayne:\nThe prosecution would like to call a witness who can prove Mr. Butz is lying.\nLeads to:\n"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"Stop him from answering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I\'ll send him a signal...)\n\n(LIE LIKE A DOG)\n\nButz:\nUm, well, see, it\'s like this: I don\'t remember.\nPayne:\nYou "don\'t remember"? Well then, we\'ll just have to remind you!\nPhoenix:\n(I got a bad feeling about this...)\nPayne:\nWe have a witness that can prove he DID go to the victim\'s apartment that day!\nLeads to:\n"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"Judge:\nWell, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?Payne:\nThe man who found the victim\'s body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw the defendant fleeing the scene of the crime!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.Payne:\nYes, Your Honor.Phoenix:\n(This is bad...)Payne:\nOn the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim\'s building. Please bring Mr. Frank Sahwit to the stand!Payne:\nMr. Sahwit, you sell newspaper subscriptions, is this correct?Sahwit:\nOh, oh yes! Newspapers, yes!Judge:\nMr. Sahwit, you may proceed with your testimony. Please tell the court what you saw on the day of the murder.Witness Testimony-- Witness\'s Account --Sahwit:\nI was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.\nI thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.\nThinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.\nThen I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!\nI quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.\nI thought to call the police immediately!\nHowever, the phone in her apartment wasn\'t working.\nI went to a nearby park and found a public phone.\nI remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.\nThe man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Judge:\nHmm...Phoenix:\n(Larry! Why didn\'t you tell the truth? I can\'t defend you against a testimony like that!)Judge:\nIncidentally, why wasn\'t the phone in the victim\'s apartment working?Payne:\nYour Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.Judge:\nAren\'t phones supposed to work during a blackout?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.Blackout Record added to the Court Record.Judge:\nNow, Mr. Wright...Phoenix:\nYes! Er... yes, Your Honor?Judge:\nYou may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:\nC-Cross-examination, Your Honor?Mia:\nAlright, Wright, this is it. The real deal!Phoenix:\nUh... what exactly am I supposed to do?Mia:\nWhy, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!Phoenix:\nLies! What?! He was lying!?Mia:\nYour client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?Phoenix:\n!!! How do I prove he\'s not?Mia:\nYou hold the key! It\'s in the evidence! Compare the witness\'s testimony to the evidence at hand. There\'s bound to be a contradiction in there! First, find contradictions between the Court Record and the witness\'s testimony. Then, once you\'ve found the contradicting evidence... present it and rub it in the witness\'s face!Phoenix:\nUm... okay.Mia:\nOpen the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab], then point out contradictions in the testimony! (Changed from [Touch the Court Record button and point out contradictions in the testimony!] in the original release)Cross Examination\nYour response should be in the format:\n"evidence 1: summary"\n"evidence 2: summary"\n"testimony 1: summary"\n"testimony 2: summary"\n"summary of full context"'}]

I\'ve got to relax!)\nJudge:\nSorry, I couldn\'t hear your answer. I\'ll ask once more:\nLeads back to:\n"Please state the name of the defendant in this case."Phoenix:\nThe defendant? Well, that\'s Larry Butz, Your Honor.Judge:\nCorrect. Just keep your wits about you and you\'ll do fine. Next question: This is a murder trial. Tell me, what\'s the victim\'s name?Phoenix:\n(Whew, I know this one! Glad I read the case report cover to cover so many times. It\'s... wait... Uh-oh! No... no way! I forgot! I\'m drawing a total blank here!)Mia:\nPhoenix! Are you absolutely SURE you\'re up to this? You don\'t even know the victim\'s name!?Phoenix:\nOh, the victim! O-Of course I know the victim\'s name! I, um, just forgot. ...Temporarily (Changed from [I, um, just forgot. ... Temporarily.] in the original release)Mia:\nI think I feel a migraine coming on. Look, the victim\'s name is listed in the Court Record. Just press [the R Button / Tab] to check it at any time, okay? (Changed from [Just touch the Court Record button to check it at any time, okay?] in the original release) Remember to check it often. Do it for me, please. I\'m begging you.Judge:\nMr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?Mia Fey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nUm... Mia Fey?\nMia:\nW-W-What!? How can I be the victim!?\nPhoenix:\nOh! Right! Sorry! I, er, it was the first name that popped into my head, and--\nMia:\nThe Court Record button! Remember to use it when you\'re in a pinch with [the R Button / Tab]. (Changed from [Remember to use it when you\'re in a pinch.] in the original release)\nJudge:\nLet me ask that one again:\nLeads back to:\n"Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?"Cinder Block\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOh, um, wasn\'t it Ms. Block? Ms. Cinder Block?\nJudge:\nThe person in question was a victim of murder, not ill-conceived naming, Mr. Wright.\nMia:\nWright? If you forget something, use [the R Button / Tab] to check the Court Record and jog your memory. (Changed from [If you forget something, [just touch the Court Record button to help you remember.] in the original release) A mistake in court could cost you the case.\nJudge:\nI\'ll ask you again:\nLeads back to:\n"Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?"Cindy Stone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n"Um... the victim\'s name is Cindy Stone."Phoenix:\nUm... the victim\'s name is Cindy Stone.Judge:\nCorrect. Now, tell me, what was the cause of death? She died because she was...?Poisoned\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOh, right! Wasn\'t she, um, poisoned by er... poison?\nJudge:\nYou\'re asking me!?\nPhoenix:\nUm... Chief! Help me out!\nMia:\nCheck the court record. [The R Button / Tab]... remember? (Changed from [Check the court record. The Court Record button... remember?] in the original release)\nPhoenix:\n(Geez. Give a guy a break!)\nJudge:\nLet me ask again.\nLeads back to:\n"She died because she was...?"Hit with a blunt object\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeads to:\n"She was struck once, by a blunt object."Strangled\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nRight... she was strangled, wasn\'t she?\nMia:\nPlease tell me that was you talking to yourself.\nJudge:\nIf you wish to hang yourself, Mr. Wright, you\'re welcome to, but not inside my courtroom. I suppose there\'s nothing to do but give you another try:\nLeads back to:\n"She died because she was...?"Phoenix:\nShe was struck once, by a blunt object.Judge:\nCorrect. You\'ve answered all my questions. I see no reason why we shouldn\'t proceed. You seem much more relaxed, Mr. Wright. Good for you.Phoenix:\nThank you, Your Honor. (Because I don\'t FEEL relaxed, that\'s for sure.)Judge:\nWell, then... First, a question for the prosecution. Mr. Payne?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nAs Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to the court just what that "object" was?Payne:\nThe murder weapon was this statue of "The Thinker." It was found lying on the floor, next to the victim.Judge:\nI see... The court accepts it into evidence. (Changed from [I see... the court accepts it into evidence.] in the original release)Statue added to the Court Record.Mia:\nWright... Be sure to pay attention to any evidence added during the trial. That evidence is the only ammunition you have in court. [Touch the Court Record button / Use the R Button] to check the Court Record frequently.Judge:\nMr. Payne, the prosecution may call its first witness.Payne:\nThe prosecution calls the defendant, Mr. Butz, to the stand.Phoenix:\nUm, Chief, what do I do now?Mia:\nPay attention. You don\'t want to miss any information that might help your client\'s case. You\'ll get your chance to respond to the prosecution later, so be ready! Let\'s just hope he doesn\'t say anything... unfortunate.Phoenix:\n(Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... This could be bad.) (Changed from [Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... this could be bad.] in the original release)Payne:\nAhem. Mr. Butz. Is it not true that the victim had recently dumped you?Butz:\nHey, watch it buddy! We were great together! We were Romeo and Juliet, Cleopatra and Mark Anthony!Phoenix:\n(Um... didn\'t they all die?)Butz:\nI wasn\'t dumped! She just wasn\'t taking my phone calls. Or seeing me... Ever. WHAT\'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?Payne:\nMr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by "dumped." In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!Butz:\nWhaddya mean, "one of them"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don\'t believe a word of it!Payne:\nYour Honor, the victim\'s passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.Passport added to the Court Record.Judge:\nHmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.Butz:\nDude... no way...Payne:\nThe victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several "Sugar Daddies."Butz:\nDaddies? Sugar?Payne:\nYes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.Butz:\nDuuude!Payne:\nWe can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?Mia:\nWright... I don\'t think you want him to answer that question.Phoenix:\n(Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)Wait and see what happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Might be better not to get involved in this one...)\nPayne:\nWell, Mr. Butz?\nButz:\nDude, no way! That cheatin\' she-dog!\nLeads to:\n"I\'m gonna die. I\'m just gonna drop dead!"Stop him from answering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nMy client had no idea the victim was seeing other men! That question is irrelevant to this case!\nPayne:\nOof! *wince*\nButz:\nDude! Nick! Whaddya mean, "irrelevant"!? That cheatin\' she-dog!\nLeads to:\n"I\'m gonna die. I\'m just gonna drop dead!"Butz:\nI\'m gonna die. I\'m just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I\'m going to get to the bottom of this!Judge:\nLet\'s continue with the trial, shall we?Payne:\nI believe the accused\'s motive is clear to everyone.Judge:\nYes, quite.Phoenix:\n(Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)Payne:\nNext question! You went to the victim\'s apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?Butz:\nGulp!Payne:\nWell, did you, or did you not?Butz:\nHeh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn\'t!Phoenix:\n(Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)Have him answer honestly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I know! I\'ll send him a signal...)\n\n(TELL THE TRUTH)\n\nButz:\nEr... Yeah! Yeah! I was there! I went!\nJudge:\nOrder! Well, Mr. Butz?\nButz:\nDude, chill! She wasn\'t home, man... So, like, I didn\'t see her.\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nYour Honor, the defendant is lying.\nJudge:\nLying?\nPayne:\nThe prosecution would like to call a witness who can prove Mr. Butz is lying.\nLeads to:\n"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"Stop him from answering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I\'ll send him a signal...)\n\n(LIE LIKE A DOG)\n\nButz:\nUm, well, see, it\'s like this: I don\'t remember.\nPayne:\nYou "don\'t remember"? Well then, we\'ll just have to remind you!\nPhoenix:\n(I got a bad feeling about this...)\nPayne:\nWe have a witness that can prove he DID go to the victim\'s apartment that day!\nLeads to:\n"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"Judge:\nWell, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?Payne:\nThe man who found the victim\'s body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw the defendant fleeing the scene of the crime!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.Payne:\nYes, Your Honor.Phoenix:\n(This is bad...)Payne:\nOn the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim\'s building. Please bring Mr. Frank Sahwit to the stand!Payne:\nMr. Sahwit, you sell newspaper subscriptions, is this correct?Sahwit:\nOh, oh yes! Newspapers, yes!Judge:\nMr. Sahwit, you may proceed with your testimony. Please tell the court what you saw on the day of the murder.Witness Testimony-- Witness\'s Account --Sahwit:\nI was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.\nI thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.\nThinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.\nThen I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!\nI quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.\nI thought to call the police immediately!\nHowever, the phone in her apartment wasn\'t working.\nI went to a nearby park and found a public phone.\nI remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.\nThe man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Judge:\nHmm...Phoenix:\n(Larry! Why didn\'t you tell the truth? I can\'t defend you against a testimony like that!)Judge:\nIncidentally, why wasn\'t the phone in the victim\'s apartment working?Payne:\nYour Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.Judge:\nAren\'t phones supposed to work during a blackout?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.Blackout Record added to the Court Record.Judge:\nNow, Mr. Wright...Phoenix:\nYes! Er... yes, Your Honor?Judge:\nYou may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:\nC-Cross-examination, Your Honor?Mia:\nAlright, Wright, this is it. The real deal!Phoenix:\nUh... what exactly am I supposed to do?Mia:\nWhy, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!Phoenix:\nLies! What?! He was lying!?Mia:\nYour client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?Phoenix:\n!!! How do I prove he\'s not?Mia:\nYou hold the key! It\'s in the evidence! Compare the witness\'s testimony to the evidence at hand. There\'s bound to be a contradiction in there! First, find contradictions between the Court Record and the witness\'s testimony. Then, once you\'ve found the contradicting evidence... present it and rub it in the witness\'s face!Phoenix:\nUm... okay.Mia:\nOpen the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab], then point out contradictions in the testimony!

Well, I have to say Phoenix, I\'m impressed! Not everyone takes on a murder trial right off the bat like this. It says a lot about you... and your client as well.Phoenix:\\nUm... thanks. Actually, it\'s because I owe him a favor.Mia:\\nA favor? You mean, you knew the defendant before this case?Phoenix:\\nYes. Actually, I kind of owe my current job to him. He\'s one of the reasons I became an attorney.Mia:\\nWell, that\'s news to me!Phoenix:\\nI want to help him out any way I can! I just... really want to help him.

The person responsible for your girlfriend\'s death? The newspapers say it was you...)Phoenix:\\nMy name is Phoenix Wright. Here\'s the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: \\"When something smells, it\'s usually the Butz.\\" In the 23 years I\'ve known him, it\'s usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it\'s usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he\'s a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that\'s just what I\'m going to do!August 3, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.

The person responsible for your girlfriend\'s death? The newspapers say it was you...)Phoenix:\nMy name is Phoenix Wright. Here\'s the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: "When something smells, it\'s usually the Butz." In the 23 years I\'ve known him, it\'s usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it\'s usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he\'s a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name.

Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn\'t!Phoenix:\n(Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)Have him answer honestly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I know! I\'ll send him a signal...)\n\n(TELL THE TRUTH)\n\nButz:\nEr... Yeah! Yeah! I was there! I went!\nJudge:\nOrder! Well, Mr. Butz?\nButz:\nDude, chill! She wasn\'t home, man... So, like, I didn\'t see her.\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nYour Honor, the defendant is lying.\nJudge:\nLying?\nPayne:\nThe prosecution would like to call a witness who can prove Mr. Butz is lying.\nLeads to:\n"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"Stop him from answering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I\'ll send him a signal...)\n\n(LIE LIKE A DOG)\n\nButz:\nUm, well, see, it\'s like this: I don\'t remember.\nPayne:\nYou "don\'t remember"? Well then, we\'ll just have to remind you!\nPhoenix:\n(I got a bad feeling about this...)\nPayne:\nWe have a witness that can prove he DID go to the victim\'s apartment that day!\nLeads to:\n"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"Judge:\nWell, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?Payne:\nThe man who found the victim\'s body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw the defendant fleeing the scene of the crime!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.Payne:\nYes, Your Honor.Phoenix:\n(This is bad...)Payne:\nOn the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim\'s building. Please bring Mr. Frank Sahwit to the stand!Payne:\nMr. Sahwit, you sell newspaper subscriptions, is this correct?Sahwit:\nOh, oh yes! Newspapers, yes!Judge:\nMr. Sahwit, you may proceed with your testimony. Please tell the court what you saw on the day of the murder.Witness Testimony-- Witness\'s Account --Sahwit:\nI was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.\nI thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.\nThinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.\nThen I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!\nI quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.\nI thought to call the police immediately!\nHowever, the phone in her apartment wasn\'t working.\nI went to a nearby park and found a public phone.\nI remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.\nThe man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Judge:\nHmm...Phoenix:\n(Larry! Why didn\'t you tell the truth? I can\'t defend you against a testimony like that!)Judge:\nIncidentally, why wasn\'t the phone in the victim\'s apartment working?Payne:\nYour Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.Judge:\nAren\'t phones supposed to work during a blackout?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.Blackout Record added to the Court Record.Judge:\nNow, Mr. Wright...Phoenix:\nYes! Er... yes, Your Honor?Judge:\nYou may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:\nC-Cross-examination, Your Honor?Mia:\nAlright, Wright, this is it. The real deal!Phoenix:\nUh... what exactly am I supposed to do?Mia:\nWhy, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!Phoenix:\nLies! What?! He was lying!?Mia:\nYour client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?Phoenix:\n!!! How do I prove he\'s not?Mia:\nYou hold the key! It\'s in the evidence! Compare the witness\'s testimony to the evidence at hand. There\'s bound to be a contradiction in there! First, find contradictions between the Court Record and the witness\'s testimony. Then, once you\'ve found the contradicting evidence... present it and rub it in the witness\'s face!Phoenix:\nUm... okay.Mia:\nOpen the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab], then point out contradictions in the testimony!

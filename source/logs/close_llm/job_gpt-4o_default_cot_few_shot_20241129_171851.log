The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say it was you...)Phoenix:\nMy name is Phoenix Wright. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\" In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!August 3, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.

Well, that's Larry Butz, Your Honor.Judge:\nCorrect. Just keep your wits about you and you'll do fine. Next question: This is a murder trial. Tell me, what's the victim's name?Phoenix:\n(Whew, I know this one! Glad I read the case report cover to cover so many times. It's... wait... Uh-oh! No... no way! I forgot! I'm drawing a total blank here!)Mia:\nPhoenix! Are you absolutely SURE you're up to this? You don't even know the victim's name!?Phoenix:\nOh, the victim! O-Of course I know the victim's name!

You've answered all my questions. I see no reason why we shouldn't proceed. You seem much more relaxed, Mr. Wright. Good for you.Phoenix:\nThank you, Your Honor. (Because I don't FEEL relaxed, that's for sure.)Judge:\nWell, then... First, a question for the prosecution. Mr. Payne?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nAs Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to the court just what that \"object\" was?Payne:\nThe murder weapon was this statue of \"The Thinker.\" It was found lying on the floor, next to the victim.Judge:\nI see... The court accepts it into evidence. (Changed from [I see... the court accepts it into evidence.] in the original release)Statue added to the Court Record.Mia:\nWright... Be sure to pay attention to any evidence added during the trial. That evidence is the only ammunition you have in court. [Touch the Court Record button / Use the R Button] to check the Court Record frequently.Judge:\nMr. Payne, the prosecution may call its first witness.Payne:\nThe prosecution calls the defendant, Mr. Butz, to the stand.Phoenix:\nUm, Chief, what do I do now?Mia:\nPay attention. You don't want to miss any information that might help your client's case. You'll get your chance to respond to the prosecution later, so be ready! Let's just hope he doesn't say anything... unfortunate.Phoenix:\n(Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... This could be bad.) (Changed from [Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... this could be bad.] in the original release)Payne:\nAhem. Mr. Butz. Is it not true that the victim had recently dumped you?Butz:\nHey, watch it buddy! We were great together! We were Romeo and Juliet, Cleopatra and Mark Anthony!Phoenix:\n(Um... didn't they all die?)Butz:\nI wasn't dumped! She just wasn't taking my phone calls. Or seeing me... Ever. WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?Payne:\nMr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by \"dumped.\" In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!Butz:\nWhaddya mean, \"one of them\"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!Payne:\nYour Honor, the victim's passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.Passport added to the Court Record.Judge:\nHmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.Butz:\nDude... no way...Payne:\nThe victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several \"Sugar Daddies.\"Butz:\nDaddies? Sugar?Payne:\nYes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.Butz:\nDuuude!Payne:\nWe can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?Mia:\nWright... I don't think you want him to answer that question.Phoenix:\n(Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)Wait and see what happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Might be better not to get involved in this one...)\nPayne:\nWell, Mr. Butz?\nButz:\nDude, no way!

That question is irrelevant to this case!\nPayne:\nOof! *wince*\nButz:\nDude! Nick! Whaddya mean, \"irrelevant\"!? That cheatin' she-dog!\nLeads to:\n\"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!\"Butz:\nI'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I'm going to get to the bottom of this!Judge:\nLet's continue with the trial, shall we?Payne:\nI believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.Judge:\nYes, quite.Phoenix:\n(Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)Payne:\nNext question! You went to the victim's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?Butz:\nGulp!Payne:\nWell, did you, or did you not?Butz:\nHeh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn't!Phoenix:\n(Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)Have him answer honestly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I know! I'll send him a signal...)\n\n(TELL THE TRUTH)\n\nButz:\nEr... Yeah! Yeah! I was there! I went!\nJudge:\nOrder! Well, Mr. Butz?\nButz:\nDude, chill! She wasn't home, man... So, like, I didn't see her.\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nYour Honor, the defendant is lying.\nJudge:\nLying?\nPayne:\nThe prosecution would like to call a witness who can prove Mr. Butz is lying.\nLeads to:\n\"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?\"Stop him from answering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I'll send him a signal...)\n\n(LIE LIKE A DOG)\n\nButz:\nUm, well, see, it's like this: I don't remember.\nPayne:\nYou \"don't remember\"? Well then, we'll just have to remind you!\nPhoenix:\n(I got a bad feeling about this...)\nPayne:\nWe have a witness that can prove he DID go to the victim's apartment that day!\nLeads to:\n\"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?\"Judge:\nWell, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?Payne:\nThe man who found the victim's body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw the defendant fleeing the scene of the crime!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.Payne:\nYes, Your Honor.Phoenix:\n(This is bad...)Payne:\nOn the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim's building. Please bring Mr. Frank Sahwit to the stand!Payne:\nMr. Sahwit, you sell newspaper subscriptions, is this correct?Sahwit:\nOh, oh yes! Newspapers, yes!Judge:\nMr. Sahwit, you may proceed with your testimony. Please tell the court what you saw on the day of the murder.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Sahwit:\nI was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.\nI thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.\nThinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.\nThen I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!\nI quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.\nI thought to call the police immediately!\nHowever, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.\nI went to a nearby park and found a public phone.\nI remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.\nThe man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Judge:\nHmm...Phoenix:\n(Larry! Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!)Judge:\nIncidentally, why wasn't the phone in the victim's apartment working?Payne:\nYour Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.Judge:\nAren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.Blackout Record added to the Court Record.Judge:\nNow, Mr. Wright...Phoenix:\nYes! Er... yes, Your Honor?Judge:\nYou may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:\nC-Cross-examination, Your Honor?Mia:\nAlright, Wright, this is it. The real deal!Phoenix:\nUh... what exactly am I supposed to do?Mia:\nWhy, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!Phoenix:\nLies! What?! He was lying!?Mia:\nYour client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?Phoenix:\n!!! How do I prove he's not?Mia:\nYou hold the key! It's in the evidence! Compare the witness's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there! First, find contradictions between the Court Record and the witness's testimony. Then, once you've found the contradicting evidence... present it and rub it in the witness's face!Phoenix:\nUm... okay.Mia:\nOpen the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab], then point out contradictions in the testimony! (Changed from [Touch the Court Record button and point out contradictions in the testimony!] in the original release)Cross Examination"

Oh, h-hiya, Chief.Mia:
Whew, I'm glad I made it on time. Well, I have to say Phoenix, I'm impressed! Not everyone takes on a murder trial right off the bat like this. It says a lot about you... and your client as well.Phoenix:
Um... thanks. Actually, it's because I owe him a favor.Mia:
A favor? You mean, you knew the defendant before this case?Phoenix:
Yes. Actually, I kind of owe my current job to him. He's one of the reasons I became an attorney.Mia:
Well, that's news to me!Phoenix:
I want to help him out any way I can! I just... really want to help him. I owe him that much.???:
(It's over! My life, everything, it's all over!)Mia:

Oh, it's all over... I... I'm finished. Finished! I can't live in a world without her! I can't! Who... who took her away from me, Nick? Who did this!? Aww, Nick, ya gotta tell me! Who took my baby away!?Phoenix:
(Hmm... The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say it was you...)Phoenix:
My name is Phoenix Wright. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: "When something smells, it's usually the Butz." In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!August 3, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz. (Changed from [The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.] in the original release)Payne:

The, um, defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:
Ahem. Mr. Wright? This is your first trial, is it not?Phoenix:
Y-Yes, Your Honor. I'm, um, a little nervous.Judge:
Your conduct during this trial will decide the fate of your client. Murder is a serious charge. For your client's sake, I hope you can control your nerves.Phoenix:
Thank... thank you, Your Honor.Judge:
... Mr. Wright, given the circumstances... I think we should have a test to ascertain your readiness.Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. (Gulp... Hands shaking... Eyesight... fading...)Judge:
This test will consist of a few simple questions. Answer them clearly and concisely. Please state the name of the defendant in this case.Phoenix Wright







Phoenix:
Um... the defendant... is me... right? (Changed from [Um... the defendant... is me, right?] in the original release)

Phoenix:
Um, er, eh? Oh yeah, right! Eh heh heh.
Mia:
This is no laughing matter! You did pass the bar, didn't you?
Judge:
Sorry, I couldn't hear your answer. I'll ask once more:

Leads to:
"The defendant? Well, that's Larry Butz, Your Honor."Mia Fey







Phoenix:
The, um, defendant? That's... er... Mia Fey?
Mia:
Wrong, Wright. Look, I have to leave. I have to go home. I'm... I'm expecting a delivery.
Phoenix:
Aw, c'mon Chief. There's no need to be going so soon, is there?
Mia:
Listen, Wright! (Changed from [Wright!] in the original release) The defendant is the one on trial--your client! (Changed from [Listen: the defendant is the one on trial--your client!] in the original release) I mean, that's about as basic as you can get!
Phoenix:
(I've put my foot in it this time! I've got to relax!)
Judge:
Sorry, I couldn't hear your answer. I'll ask once more:
Leads back to:
"Please state the name of the defendant in this case."Phoenix:
The defendant? Well, that's Larry Butz, Your Honor.Judge:
Correct. Just keep your wits about you and you'll do fine. Next question: This is a murder trial. Tell me, what's the victim's name?Phoenix:
(Whew, I know this one! Glad I read the case report cover to cover so many times. It's... wait... Uh-oh! No... no way! I forgot! I'm drawing a total blank here!)Mia:
Phoenix! Are you absolutely SURE you're up to this? You don't even know the victim's name!?Phoenix:
Oh, the victim! O-Of course I know the victim's name! I, um, just forgot. ...Temporarily (Changed from [I, um, just forgot. ... Temporarily.] in the original release)Mia:
I think I feel a migraine coming on. Look, the victim's name is listed in the Court Record. Just press [the R Button / Tab] to check it at any time, okay? (Changed from [Just touch the Court Record button to check it at any time, okay?] in the original release) Remember to check it often. Do it for me, please. I'm begging you.Judge:

Um... Mia Fey?
Mia:
W-W-What!? How can I be the victim!?

Judge:
Let me ask that one again:
Leads back to:
"Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?"Cinder Block







Phoenix:
Oh, um, wasn't it Ms. Block? Ms. Cinder Block?
Judge:
The person in question was a victim of murder, not ill-conceived naming, Mr. Wright.
Mia:
Wright? If you forget something, use [the R Button / Tab] to check the Court Record and jog your memory. (Changed from [If you forget something, [just touch the Court Record button to help you remember.] in the original release) A mistake in court could cost you the case.

"Um... the victim's name is Cindy Stone."Phoenix:
Um... the victim's name is Cindy Stone.Judge:
Correct. Now, tell me, what was the cause of death? She died because she was...?Poisoned







Phoenix:
Oh, right! Wasn't she, um, poisoned by er... poison?
Judge:
You're asking me!?
Phoenix:
Um... Chief! Help me out!

Check the court record. [The R Button / Tab]... remember? (Changed from [Check the court record. The Court Record button... remember?] in the original release)

Leads to:
"She was struck once, by a blunt object."Strangled







Phoenix:
Right... she was strangled, wasn't she?
Mia:
Please tell me that was you talking to yourself.
Judge:
If you wish to hang yourself, Mr. Wright, you're welcome to, but not inside my courtroom. I suppose there's nothing to do but give you another try:
Leads back to:
"She died because she was...?"Phoenix:
She was struck once, by a blunt object.Judge:
Correct. You've answered all my questions. I see no reason why we shouldn't proceed. You seem much more relaxed, Mr. Wright. Good for you.Phoenix:
Thank you, Your Honor. (Because I don't FEEL relaxed, that's for sure.)Judge:
Well, then... First, a question for the prosecution. Mr. Payne?Payne:
Yes, Your Honor?Judge:
As Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to the court just what that "object" was?Payne:
The murder weapon was this statue of "The Thinker." It was found lying on the floor, next to the victim.Judge:
I see... The court accepts it into evidence. (Changed from [I see... the court accepts it into evidence.] in the original release)Statue added to the Court Record.Mia:
Wright... Be sure to pay attention to any evidence added during the trial. That evidence is the only ammunition you have in court. [Touch the Court Record button / Use the R Button] to check the Court Record frequently.Judge:
Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its first witness.Payne:
The prosecution calls the defendant, Mr. Butz, to the stand.Phoenix:
Um, Chief, what do I do now?Mia:
Pay attention. You don't want to miss any information that might help your client's case. You'll get your chance to respond to the prosecution later, so be ready! Let's just hope he doesn't say anything... unfortunate.Phoenix:
(Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... This could be bad.) (Changed from [Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... this could be bad.] in the original release)Payne:

(Um... didn't they all die?)Butz:
I wasn't dumped! She just wasn't taking my phone calls. Or seeing me... Ever. WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?Payne:
Mr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by "dumped." In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!Butz:
Whaddya mean, "one of them"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!Payne:
Your Honor, the victim's passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.Passport added to the Court Record.Judge:
Hmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.Butz:
Dude... no way...Payne:
The victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several "Sugar Daddies."Butz:
Daddies? Sugar?Payne:
Yes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.Butz:
Duuude!Payne:
We can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?Mia:
Wright... I don't think you want him to answer that question.Phoenix:
(Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)Wait and see what happens







Phoenix:
(Might be better not to get involved in this one...)
Payne:
Well, Mr. Butz?
Butz:
Dude, no way! That cheatin' she-dog!
Leads to:
"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!"Stop him from answering

Let's continue with the trial, shall we?Payne:
I believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.Judge:
Yes, quite.Phoenix:
(Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)Payne:
Next question! You went to the victim's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?Butz:
Gulp!Payne:
Well, did you, or did you not?Butz:
Heh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn't!Phoenix:

You "don't remember"? Well then, we'll just have to remind you!
Phoenix:
(I got a bad feeling about this...)
Payne:
We have a witness that can prove he DID go to the victim's apartment that day!
Leads to:
"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"Judge:
Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?Payne:
The man who found the victim's body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw the defendant fleeing the scene of the crime!Judge:
Order! Order in the court! Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.Payne:
Yes, Your Honor.Phoenix:
(This is bad...)Payne:
On the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim's building. Please bring Mr. Frank Sahwit to the stand!Payne:
Mr. Sahwit, you sell newspaper subscriptions, is this correct?Sahwit:
Oh, oh yes! Newspapers, yes!Judge:
Mr. Sahwit, you may proceed with your testimony. Please tell the court what you saw on the day of the murder.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Sahwit:
I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.
I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.
Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.
Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!
I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.
I thought to call the police immediately!
However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.
I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.
I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.
The man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Judge:
Hmm...Phoenix:
(Larry! Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!)Judge:
Incidentally, why wasn't the phone in the victim's apartment working?Payne:
Your Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.Judge:
Aren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?Payne:
Yes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.Blackout Record added to the Court Record.Judge:
Now, Mr. Wright...Phoenix:
Yes! Er... yes, Your Honor?Judge:
You may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:
C-Cross-examination, Your Honor?Mia:
Alright, Wright, this is it. The real deal!Phoenix:
Uh... what exactly am I supposed to do?Mia:
Why, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!Phoenix:
Lies! What?! He was lying!?Mia:
Your client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?Phoenix:
!!! How do I prove he's not?Mia:
You hold the key! It's in the evidence! Compare the witness's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there! First, find contradictions between the Court Record and the witness's testimony. Then, once you've found the contradicting evidence... present it and rub it in the witness's face!Phoenix:
Um... okay.Mia:
Open the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab], then point out contradictions in the testimony! (Changed from [Touch the Court Record button and point out contradictions in the testimony!] in the original release)Cross Examination

2024-11-29 17:18:56 [INFO] Assistant reply: To expose the contradiction in the witness Frank Sahwit's testimony, we need to identify where his statements contradict the available evidence.

1. **Identify the Relevant Testimony Statement:**
   - Sahwit claims he remembers the time exactly being 1:00 PM when he found the victim.

2. **Analyze the Evidence:**
   - Cindy's Autopsy Report states the time of death as between 4 PM and 5 PM. 
   - This contradicts Sahwit's assertion that he remembers it was 1:00 PM, as she couldn't have been found dead at that time if the time of death is later in the afternoon.

Given these points, the contradiction is at testimony statement 8. The relevant evidence to present is Cindy's Autopsy Report, which contradicts his claim regarding the time.

Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.Payne:\nYes, Your Honor.Phoenix:\n(This is bad...)Payne:\nOn the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim's building.

Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!)Judge:\nIncidentally, why wasn't the phone in the victim's apartment working?Payne:\nYour Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.Judge:\nAren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.Blackout Record added to the Court Record.Judge:\nNow, Mr. Wright...Phoenix:\nYes! Er... yes, Your Honor?Judge:\nYou may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:\nC-Cross-examination, Your Honor?Mia:\nAlright, Wright, this is it. The real deal!Phoenix:\nUh... what exactly am I supposed to do?Mia:\nWhy, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!Phoenix:\nLies! What?! He was lying!?Mia:\nYour client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?Phoenix:\n!!! How do I prove he's not?Mia:\nYou hold the key! It's in the evidence! Compare the witness's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there!

(Boy am I nervous!)Mia:
Wright!Phoenix:
Oh, h-hiya, Chief.Mia:
Whew, I'm glad I made it on time. Well, I have to say Phoenix, I'm impressed! Not everyone takes on a murder trial right off the bat like this. It says a lot about you... and your client as well.Phoenix:
Um... thanks. Actually, it's because I owe him a favor.Mia:
A favor? You mean, you knew the defendant before this case?Phoenix:
Yes. Actually, I kind of owe my current job to him. He's one of the reasons I became an attorney.Mia:
Well, that's news to me!Phoenix:
I want to help him out any way I can! I just... really want to help him. I owe him that much.???:
(It's over! My life, everything, it's all over!)Mia:
... Is that your client screaming over there? (Changed from [Isn't that your client screaming over there?] in the original release)Phoenix:

(Hmm... The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say it was you...)Phoenix:
My name is Phoenix Wright. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: "When something smells, it's usually the Butz." In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!August 3, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:

Pay attention. You don't want to miss any information that might help your client's case. You'll get your chance to respond to the prosecution later, so be ready! Let's just hope he doesn't say anything... unfortunate.Phoenix:
(Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... This could be bad.) (Changed from [Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... this could be bad.] in the original release)Payne:
Ahem. Mr. Butz. Is it not true that the victim had recently dumped you?Butz:
Hey, watch it buddy! We were great together! We were Romeo and Juliet, Cleopatra and Mark Anthony!Phoenix:
(Um... didn't they all die?)Butz:
I wasn't dumped! She just wasn't taking my phone calls. Or seeing me... Ever. WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?Payne:
Mr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by "dumped." In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!Butz:
Whaddya mean, "one of them"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!Payne:
Your Honor, the victim's passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.Passport added to the Court Record.Judge:
Hmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.Butz:
Dude... no way...Payne:
The victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several "Sugar Daddies."Butz:
Daddies? Sugar?Payne:
Yes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.Butz:
Duuude!Payne:
We can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?Mia:
Wright... I don't think you want him to answer that question.Phoenix:
(Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)Wait and see what happens







Phoenix:
(Might be better not to get involved in this one...)
Payne:
Well, Mr. Butz?
Butz:
Dude, no way! That cheatin' she-dog!
Leads to:
"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!"Stop him from answering







Phoenix:
My client had no idea the victim was seeing other men! That question is irrelevant to this case!
Payne:
Oof! *wince*
Butz:
Dude! Nick! Whaddya mean, "irrelevant"!? That cheatin' she-dog!
Leads to:
"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!"Butz:
I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I'm going to get to the bottom of this!Judge:
Let's continue with the trial, shall we?Payne:
I believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.Judge:
Yes, quite.Phoenix:
(Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)Payne:
Next question! You went to the victim's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?Butz:
Gulp!Payne:
Well, did you, or did you not?Butz:
Heh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn't!Phoenix:
(Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)Have him answer honestly







Phoenix:
(I know! I'll send him a signal...)

(TELL THE TRUTH)

Butz:
Er... Yeah! Yeah! I was there! I went!
Judge:
Order! Well, Mr. Butz?
Butz:
Dude, chill! She wasn't home, man... So, like, I didn't see her.
Payne:

Payne:
Your Honor, the defendant is lying.
Judge:
Lying?
Payne:
The prosecution would like to call a witness who can prove Mr. Butz is lying.
Leads to:
"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"Stop him from answering







Phoenix:
(I'll send him a signal...)

(LIE LIKE A DOG)

Butz:
Um, well, see, it's like this: I don't remember.
Payne:
You "don't remember"? Well then, we'll just have to remind you!
Phoenix:
(I got a bad feeling about this...)
Payne:
We have a witness that can prove he DID go to the victim's apartment that day!
Leads to:
"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"Judge:
Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?Payne:
The man who found the victim's body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw the defendant fleeing the scene of the crime!Judge:
Order! Order in the court! Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.Payne:
Yes, Your Honor.Phoenix:
(This is bad...)Payne:
On the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim's building. Please bring Mr. Frank Sahwit to the stand!Payne:
Mr. Sahwit, you sell newspaper subscriptions, is this correct?Sahwit:
Oh, oh yes! Newspapers, yes!Judge:
Mr. Sahwit, you may proceed with your testimony. Please tell the court what you saw on the day of the murder.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Sahwit:
I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.
I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.
Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.
Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!
I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.
I thought to call the police immediately!
However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.
I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.
I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.
The man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Judge:
Hmm...Phoenix:
(Larry! Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!)Judge:
Incidentally, why wasn't the phone in the victim's apartment working?Payne:
Your Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.Judge:
Aren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?Payne:
Yes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.Blackout Record added to the Court Record.Judge:
Now, Mr. Wright...Phoenix:
Yes! Er... yes, Your Honor?Judge:
You may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:
C-Cross-examination, Your Honor?Mia:
Alright, Wright, this is it. The real deal!Phoenix:
Uh... what exactly am I supposed to do?Mia:
Why, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!Phoenix:
Lies! What?! He was lying!?Mia:
Your client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?Phoenix:
!!! How do I prove he's not?Mia:
You hold the key! It's in the evidence! Compare the witness's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there! First, find contradictions between the Court Record and the witness's testimony. Then, once you've found the contradicting evidence... present it and rub it in the witness's face!Phoenix:
Um... okay.Mia:
Open the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab], then point out contradictions in the testimony! (Changed from [Touch the Court Record button and point out contradictions in the testimony!] in the original release)Cross Examination-- Witness's Account --Sahwit:

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Isn't a man leaving an apartment a common sight? I find it odd you would take notice of him...
Sahwit:
Er... heh. I don't know. He just seemed strange to me, that's all. Like he was mad, and yet frightened at the same time. Just like... a criminal fleeing the scene of a crime!
Phoenix:
The defense requests that the witness refrain from conjecture!
Payne:
Of course. What the witness means is that the man he saw looked suspicious. So, what happened next?Sahwit:
I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Half-open... you say?
Sahwit:
Yes, yes, the door was open halfway. Yes. I watched for a moment, but no one came to close the door. "That's odd, in a big city like this," I thought...
Payne:
I see. And what happened next?Sahwit:
Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What gave you the idea to do that?
Sahwit:
Well, the door was half-open, you see. Isn't it only human to want to... peek? We climb mountains because they are there! It's the same thing.
Payne:
Truer words have never been spoken! Anyone would look inside!
Phoenix:

Payne:
So you looked into the apartment. What happened then?Sahwit:
Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Are you sure she was dead?
Sahwit:
W-Well, no, I guess I wasn't. But, she wasn't moving at all, and there was blood everywhere.

I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.Press

So, you didn't touch ANYTHING in the apartment?
Sahwit:
Um, yes. I mean no! Nothing.

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
You "thought" to call the police? Does that mean you didn't actually call them!?

The phone in her apartment wasn't working?
Sahwit:
Yes. I mean, no. No, it wasn't. Right. (Changed from [Yes. I mean, no, no it wasn't. Right.] in the original release)
Phoenix:
But you said you didn't go into the apartment... or did you!?
Sahwit:
Oh, oh, that? I can explain that! There was a cordless phone on a shelf in the entranceway. I reached inside and tried using that to call...
Payne:
And the phone wasn't working, correct? What happened next?Sahwit:
I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Why use a public phone?
Sahwit:
Well, you see, I don't have a cell phone. And, being the middle of the afternoon, there was no answer at the nearby apartments.
Phoenix:
Ah, right... what time did you call again?Sahwit:
I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
1:00 PM! Are you certain?
Sahwit:
Yes. Absolutely.

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Are you absolutely, 100% positive?
Sahwit:
Yes, it was him. No mistake about it.
Payne:
The witness says he's certain!Mia:
That's all of it. There must be a contradiction in there somewhere. Examine the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab] if something strikes you as being suspicious. (Changed from [Examine the Court Record button if something strikes you as being suspicious.] in the original release) Then, find the evidence that contradicts his testimony, and present it to the court!Phoenix:
You found the body at 1:00 PM. You're sure?Sahwit:
Yes. It was 1:00 PM, for certain.Phoenix:
Frankly, I find that hard to believe! Your statement directly contradicts the autopsy report. The autopsy notes the time of death at sometime after 4PM. There was nobody to... er... no "body" to find at 1:00 PM! How do you explain this three-hour gap?Sahwit:
!!! Oh, that! Oh, er...Payne:Payne:
This is trivial! The witness merely forgot the time!Judge:
After his testimony, I find that hard to believe. Mr. Sahwit... Why were you so certain that you found the body at 1:00 PM?Sahwit:
I... er... well, I... Gee, that's a really good question!Mia:
Great job, Wright! Way to put him on the spot! That's all you have to do: point out contradictions! Lies always beget more lies! See through one, and their whole story falls apart!Sahwit:
Wait! I remember now!Judge:
Would you care to give your testimony again?Witness Testimony-- The Time of Discovery --Sahwit:
You see, when I found the body, I heard the time.
There was a voice saying the time... It was probably coming from the television.
Oh, but it was three hours off, wasn't it?
I guess the victim must have been watching a video of a taped program!
That's why I thought it was 1:00 PM!
Terribly sorry about the misunderstanding...Judge:
Hmm... I see. You heard a voice saying the time on a taped program. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Mia:
Wright! You know what to do!Phoenix:

2024-11-29 17:19:01 [INFO] Assistant reply: To identify the contradiction in Frank Sahwit's new testimony, let's examine each statement alongside the evidence we have:

1. **Statement 0**: "You see, when I found the body, I heard the time."
2. **Statement 1**: "There was a voice saying the time... It was probably coming from the television."
3. **Statement 2**: "Oh, but it was three hours off, wasn't it?"
4. **Statement 3**: "I guess the victim must have been watching a video of a taped program!"
5. **Statement 4**: "That's why I thought it was 1:00 PM!"
6. **Statement 5**: "Terribly sorry about the misunderstanding..."

Now, considering the evidence:

- **Cindy's Autopsy Report**: Notes the time of death as between 4 PM and 5 PM, meaning Sahwit could not have seen the body at 1:00 PM since Cindy was not dead yet.
- **Blackout Record**: States there was a blackout in the building from noon to 6 PM on the day of the murder, which means the TV could not have been on at 1:00 PM to state the time, due to the power outage.

The contradiction comes from Sahwit's claim that he heard the time from the television. Given the blackout from noon to 6 PM, the television could not have been functioning at 1:00 PM. This points to the inconsistency, revealing that Sahwit could not have used the TV to hear the time.

Thus, the evidence of the **Blackout Record** should be presented against **Statement 1** to confirm that the TV could not have been on at that time.

A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\" In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!August 3, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.

Our school had a saying: \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\" In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one.

In this example, the witness claims to remember the time exactly as 1:00 PM, but the Cindy's Autopsy Report records the time of death between 4 PM-5 PM. This discrepancy can be presented as evidence to contradict the witness's statement.

Answer:
{
  "action": "present",
  "testimony": 9,
  "evidence": 2
}
Below are the witness' testimonies:
0: Actually, I didn't "hear" the time... I "saw" it!
1: There was a table clock in the apartment, wasn't there!
2: Yeah, the murder weapon! The killer used it to hit the victim!
3: That must have been what I saw.
Below are the evidences you have:

Below are the people relevant in this case:

Dammit! ...Why me? I can't get caught... Not like this! I-I've gotta find someone to pin this on... Someone like... him! I'll make it look like HE did it!August 3, 9:47 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 2Phoenix:
(Boy am I nervous!)Mia:
Wright!Phoenix:
Oh, h-hiya, Chief.Mia:
Whew, I'm glad I made it on time. Well, I have to say Phoenix, I'm impressed! Not everyone takes on a murder trial right off the bat like this. It says a lot about you... and your client as well.Phoenix:
Um... thanks. Actually, it's because I owe him a favor.Mia:
A favor? You mean, you knew the defendant before this case?Phoenix:
Yes. Actually, I kind of owe my current job to him. He's one of the reasons I became an attorney.Mia:
Well, that's news to me!Phoenix:
I want to help him out any way I can! I just... really want to help him. I owe him that much.???:
(It's over! My life, everything, it's all over!)Mia:
... Is that your client screaming over there? (Changed from [Isn't that your client screaming over there?] in the original release)Phoenix:
Yeah... it's him. (Changed from [Yeah... that's him.] in the original release)???:
(Death! Despair! Ohhhh! I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna die!!!)Mia:
It sounds like he wants to die...Phoenix:
Um, yeah. *sigh*Butz:
Nick!!!Phoenix:
Hey. Hey there, Larry.Butz:
Dude, I'm so guilty!! Tell them I'm guilty!!! Gimme the death sentence! I ain't afraid to die!Phoenix:
What!? What's wrong, Larry?Butz:
Oh, it's all over... I... I'm finished. Finished! I can't live in a world without her! I can't! Who... who took her away from me, Nick? Who did this!? Aww, Nick, ya gotta tell me! Who took my baby away!?Phoenix:
(Hmm... The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say it was you...)Phoenix:
My name is Phoenix Wright. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: "When something smells, it's usually the Butz." In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!August 3, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz. (Changed from [The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.] in the original release)Payne:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The, um, defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:
Ahem. Mr. Wright? This is your first trial, is it not?Phoenix:
Y-Yes, Your Honor. I'm, um, a little nervous.Judge:
Your conduct during this trial will decide the fate of your client. Murder is a serious charge. For your client's sake, I hope you can control your nerves.Phoenix:
Thank... thank you, Your Honor.Judge:
... Mr. Wright, given the circumstances... I think we should have a test to ascertain your readiness.Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. (Gulp... Hands shaking... Eyesight... fading...)Judge:
This test will consist of a few simple questions. Answer them clearly and concisely. Please state the name of the defendant in this case.Phoenix Wright







Phoenix:
Um... the defendant... is me... right? (Changed from [Um... the defendant... is me, right?] in the original release)
Mia:
Wright! Have you completely lost your mind? Focus! The defendant is the person on trial! You're his lawyer!
Phoenix:
Um, er, eh? Oh yeah, right! Eh heh heh.
Mia:
This is no laughing matter! You did pass the bar, didn't you?
Judge:
Sorry, I couldn't hear your answer. I'll ask once more:
Leads back to:
"Please state the name of the defendant in this case."Larry Butz







Leads to:
"The defendant? Well, that's Larry Butz, Your Honor."Mia Fey







Phoenix:
The, um, defendant? That's... er... Mia Fey?
Mia:
Wrong, Wright. Look, I have to leave. I have to go home. I'm... I'm expecting a delivery.
Phoenix:
Aw, c'mon Chief. There's no need to be going so soon, is there?
Mia:
Listen, Wright! (Changed from [Wright!] in the original release) The defendant is the one on trial--your client! (Changed from [Listen: the defendant is the one on trial--your client!] in the original release) I mean, that's about as basic as you can get!
Phoenix:
(I've put my foot in it this time! I've got to relax!)
Judge:
Sorry, I couldn't hear your answer. I'll ask once more:
Leads back to:
"Please state the name of the defendant in this case."Phoenix:
The defendant? Well, that's Larry Butz, Your Honor.Judge:
Correct. Just keep your wits about you and you'll do fine. Next question: This is a murder trial. Tell me, what's the victim's name?Phoenix:
(Whew, I know this one! Glad I read the case report cover to cover so many times. It's... wait... Uh-oh! No... no way! I forgot! I'm drawing a total blank here!)Mia:
Phoenix! Are you absolutely SURE you're up to this? You don't even know the victim's name!?Phoenix:
Oh, the victim! O-Of course I know the victim's name! I, um, just forgot. ...Temporarily (Changed from [I, um, just forgot. ... Temporarily.] in the original release)Mia:
I think I feel a migraine coming on. Look, the victim's name is listed in the Court Record. Just press [the R Button / Tab] to check it at any time, okay? (Changed from [Just touch the Court Record button to check it at any time, okay?] in the original release) Remember to check it often. Do it for me, please. I'm begging you.Judge:
Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?Mia Fey







Phoenix:
Um... Mia Fey?
Mia:
W-W-What!? How can I be the victim!?
Phoenix:
Oh! Right! Sorry! I, er, it was the first name that popped into my head, and--
Mia:
The Court Record button! Remember to use it when you're in a pinch with [the R Button / Tab]. (Changed from [Remember to use it when you're in a pinch.] in the original release)
Judge:
Let me ask that one again:
Leads back to:
"Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?"Cinder Block







Phoenix:
Oh, um, wasn't it Ms. Block? Ms. Cinder Block?
Judge:
The person in question was a victim of murder, not ill-conceived naming, Mr. Wright.
Mia:
Wright? If you forget something, use [the R Button / Tab] to check the Court Record and jog your memory. (Changed from [If you forget something, [just touch the Court Record button to help you remember.] in the original release) A mistake in court could cost you the case.
Judge:
I'll ask you again:
Leads back to:
"Mr. Wright. Who is the victim in this case?"Cindy Stone







Leads to:
"Um... the victim's name is Cindy Stone."Phoenix:
Um... the victim's name is Cindy Stone.Judge:
Correct. Now, tell me, what was the cause of death? She died because she was...?Poisoned







Phoenix:
Oh, right! Wasn't she, um, poisoned by er... poison?
Judge:
You're asking me!?
Phoenix:
Um... Chief! Help me out!
Mia:
Check the court record. [The R Button / Tab]... remember? (Changed from [Check the court record. The Court Record button... remember?] in the original release)
Phoenix:
(Geez. Give a guy a break!)
Judge:
Let me ask again.
Leads back to:
"She died because she was...?"Hit with a blunt object







Leads to:
"She was struck once, by a blunt object."Strangled







Phoenix:
Right... she was strangled, wasn't she?
Mia:
Please tell me that was you talking to yourself.
Judge:
If you wish to hang yourself, Mr. Wright, you're welcome to, but not inside my courtroom. I suppose there's nothing to do but give you another try:
Leads back to:
"She died because she was...?"Phoenix:
She was struck once, by a blunt object.Judge:
Correct. You've answered all my questions. I see no reason why we shouldn't proceed. You seem much more relaxed, Mr. Wright. Good for you.Phoenix:
Thank you, Your Honor. (Because I don't FEEL relaxed, that's for sure.)Judge:
Well, then... First, a question for the prosecution. Mr. Payne?Payne:
Yes, Your Honor?Judge:
As Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to the court just what that "object" was?Payne:
The murder weapon was this statue of "The Thinker." It was found lying on the floor, next to the victim.Judge:
I see... The court accepts it into evidence. (Changed from [I see... the court accepts it into evidence.] in the original release)Statue added to the Court Record.Mia:
Wright... Be sure to pay attention to any evidence added during the trial. That evidence is the only ammunition you have in court. [Touch the Court Record button / Use the R Button] to check the Court Record frequently.Judge:
Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its first witness.Payne:
The prosecution calls the defendant, Mr. Butz, to the stand.Phoenix:
Um, Chief, what do I do now?Mia:
Pay attention. You don't want to miss any information that might help your client's case. You'll get your chance to respond to the prosecution later, so be ready! Let's just hope he doesn't say anything... unfortunate.Phoenix:
(Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... This could be bad.) (Changed from [Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... this could be bad.] in the original release)Payne:
Ahem. Mr. Butz. Is it not true that the victim had recently dumped you?Butz:
Hey, watch it buddy! We were great together! We were Romeo and Juliet, Cleopatra and Mark Anthony!Phoenix:
(Um... didn't they all die?)Butz:
I wasn't dumped! She just wasn't taking my phone calls. Or seeing me... Ever. WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?Payne:
Mr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by "dumped." In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!Butz:
Whaddya mean, "one of them"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!Payne:
Your Honor, the victim's passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.Passport added to the Court Record.Judge:
Hmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.Butz:
Dude... no way...Payne:
The victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several "Sugar Daddies."Butz:
Daddies? Sugar?Payne:
Yes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.Butz:
Duuude!Payne:
We can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?Mia:
Wright... I don't think you want him to answer that question.Phoenix:
(Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)Wait and see what happens







Phoenix:
(Might be better not to get involved in this one...)
Payne:
Well, Mr. Butz?
Butz:
Dude, no way! That cheatin' she-dog!
Leads to:
"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!"Stop him from answering







Phoenix:
My client had no idea the victim was seeing other men! That question is irrelevant to this case!
Payne:
Oof! *wince*
Butz:
Dude! Nick! Whaddya mean, "irrelevant"!? That cheatin' she-dog!
Leads to:
"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!"Butz:
I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I'm going to get to the bottom of this!Judge:
Let's continue with the trial, shall we?Payne:
I believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.Judge:
Yes, quite.Phoenix:
(Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)Payne:
Next question! You went to the victim's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?Butz:
Gulp!Payne:
Well, did you, or did you not?Butz:
Heh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn't!Phoenix:
(Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)Have him answer honestly







Phoenix:
(I know! I'll send him a signal...)

(TELL THE TRUTH)

Butz:
Er... Yeah! Yeah! I was there! I went!
Judge:
Order! Well, Mr. Butz?
Butz:
Dude, chill! She wasn't home, man... So, like, I didn't see her.
Payne:

Payne:
Your Honor, the defendant is lying.
Judge:
Lying?
Payne:
The prosecution would like to call a witness who can prove Mr. Butz is lying.
Leads to:
"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"Stop him from answering







Phoenix:
(I'll send him a signal...)

(LIE LIKE A DOG)

Butz:
Um, well, see, it's like this: I don't remember.
Payne:
You "don't remember"? Well then, we'll just have to remind you!
Phoenix:
(I got a bad feeling about this...)
Payne:
We have a witness that can prove he DID go to the victim's apartment that day!
Leads to:
"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?"Judge:
Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?Payne:
The man who found the victim's body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw the defendant fleeing the scene of the crime!Judge:
Order! Order in the court! Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.Payne:
Yes, Your Honor.Phoenix:
(This is bad...)Payne:
On the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim's building. Please bring Mr. Frank Sahwit to the stand!Payne:
Mr. Sahwit, you sell newspaper subscriptions, is this correct?Sahwit:
Oh, oh yes! Newspapers, yes!Judge:
Mr. Sahwit, you may proceed with your testimony. Please tell the court what you saw on the day of the murder.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Sahwit:
I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.
I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.
Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.
Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!
I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.
I thought to call the police immediately!
However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.
I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.
I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.
The man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Judge:
Hmm...Phoenix:
(Larry! Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!)Judge:
Incidentally, why wasn't the phone in the victim's apartment working?Payne:
Your Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.Judge:
Aren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?Payne:
Yes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.Blackout Record added to the Court Record.Judge:
Now, Mr. Wright...Phoenix:
Yes! Er... yes, Your Honor?Judge:
You may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:
C-Cross-examination, Your Honor?Mia:
Alright, Wright, this is it. The real deal!Phoenix:
Uh... what exactly am I supposed to do?Mia:
Why, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!Phoenix:
Lies! What?! He was lying!?Mia:
Your client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?Phoenix:
!!! How do I prove he's not?Mia:
You hold the key! It's in the evidence! Compare the witness's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there! First, find contradictions between the Court Record and the witness's testimony. Then, once you've found the contradicting evidence... present it and rub it in the witness's face!Phoenix:
Um... okay.Mia:
Open the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab], then point out contradictions in the testimony! (Changed from [Touch the Court Record button and point out contradictions in the testimony!] in the original release)Cross Examination-- Witness's Account --Sahwit:

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Isn't a man leaving an apartment a common sight? I find it odd you would take notice of him...
Sahwit:
Er... heh. I don't know. He just seemed strange to me, that's all. Like he was mad, and yet frightened at the same time. Just like... a criminal fleeing the scene of a crime!
Phoenix:
The defense requests that the witness refrain from conjecture!
Payne:
Of course. What the witness means is that the man he saw looked suspicious. So, what happened next?Sahwit:
I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Half-open... you say?
Sahwit:
Yes, yes, the door was open halfway. Yes. I watched for a moment, but no one came to close the door. "That's odd, in a big city like this," I thought...
Payne:
I see. And what happened next?Sahwit:
Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What gave you the idea to do that?
Sahwit:
Well, the door was half-open, you see. Isn't it only human to want to... peek? We climb mountains because they are there! It's the same thing.
Payne:
Truer words have never been spoken! Anyone would look inside!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... why did Payne cut him off so quickly?)
Payne:
So you looked into the apartment. What happened then?Sahwit:
Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Are you sure she was dead?
Sahwit:
W-Well, no, I guess I wasn't. But, she wasn't moving at all, and there was blood everywhere.
Phoenix:
(I guess that would look fatal to anyone...) Very well, what happened next?Sahwit:
I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So, you didn't touch ANYTHING in the apartment?
Sahwit:
Um, yes. I mean no! Nothing.
Phoenix:
Okay. What happened next?Sahwit:
I thought to call the police immediately!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
You "thought" to call the police? Does that mean you didn't actually call them!?
Payne:
Please, please... Listen to the rest of the testimony. You thought to call the police... What happened next?Sahwit:
However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
The phone in her apartment wasn't working?
Sahwit:
Yes. I mean, no. No, it wasn't. Right. (Changed from [Yes. I mean, no, no it wasn't. Right.] in the original release)
Phoenix:
But you said you didn't go into the apartment... or did you!?
Sahwit:
Oh, oh, that? I can explain that! There was a cordless phone on a shelf in the entranceway. I reached inside and tried using that to call...
Payne:
And the phone wasn't working, correct? What happened next?Sahwit:
I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Why use a public phone?
Sahwit:
Well, you see, I don't have a cell phone. And, being the middle of the afternoon, there was no answer at the nearby apartments.
Phoenix:
Ah, right... what time did you call again?Sahwit:
I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
1:00 PM! Are you certain?
Sahwit:
Yes. Absolutely.
Phoenix:
(Hmm... He seems really confident.)
Mia:
1:00 PM? Wright. Doesn't that seem strange to you? Present some evidence to contradict him!Present Cindy's Autopsy Report







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"You found the body at 1:00 PM. You're sure?"Sahwit:
The man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Are you absolutely, 100% positive?
Sahwit:
Yes, it was him. No mistake about it.
Payne:
The witness says he's certain!Mia:
That's all of it. There must be a contradiction in there somewhere. Examine the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab] if something strikes you as being suspicious. (Changed from [Examine the Court Record button if something strikes you as being suspicious.] in the original release) Then, find the evidence that contradicts his testimony, and present it to the court!Phoenix:
You found the body at 1:00 PM. You're sure?Sahwit:
Yes. It was 1:00 PM, for certain.Phoenix:
Frankly, I find that hard to believe! Your statement directly contradicts the autopsy report. The autopsy notes the time of death at sometime after 4PM. There was nobody to... er... no "body" to find at 1:00 PM! How do you explain this three-hour gap?Sahwit:
!!! Oh, that! Oh, er...Payne:Payne:
This is trivial! The witness merely forgot the time!Judge:
After his testimony, I find that hard to believe. Mr. Sahwit... Why were you so certain that you found the body at 1:00 PM?Sahwit:
I... er... well, I... Gee, that's a really good question!Mia:
Great job, Wright! Way to put him on the spot! That's all you have to do: point out contradictions! Lies always beget more lies! See through one, and their whole story falls apart!Sahwit:
Wait! I remember now!Judge:
Would you care to give your testimony again?Witness Testimony-- The Time of Discovery --Sahwit:
You see, when I found the body, I heard the time.
There was a voice saying the time... It was probably coming from the television.
Oh, but it was three hours off, wasn't it?
I guess the victim must have been watching a video of a taped program!
That's why I thought it was 1:00 PM!
Terribly sorry about the misunderstanding...Judge:
Hmm... I see. You heard a voice saying the time on a taped program. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Mia:
Wright! You know what to do!Phoenix:

You said "heard"... Not "saw"?
Sahwit:
Yes, heard. All I saw was the body lying there... I didn't think to look at anything else, least of all my watch.
Phoenix:
Hmm... Isn't that a little strange? So you're saying you "heard" something. But if you were so shocked by the body, you wouldn't hear anything at all!
Payne:

Payne:
The witness did say he actually heard the time. It's ludicrous to suggest he "wouldn't hear anything"!

Well, no, I guess it might have been a radio.

Incidentally, there was no radio on the premises. There was only one large television.

Gah!!! I... well... urk!Judge:
The defense has a point. Do you have an explanation for this, Mr. Sahwit?Sahwit:
No, I... I find it quite puzzling myself! Quite! ... Aah! W-wait! I remember now!Judge:
Mr. Sahwit? The court would prefer to hear an accurate testimony from the very beginning. These constant corrections are harming your credibility. That, and you seem rather... distraught.Sahwit:
...! M-my apologies, Your Honor! It... er, it must have been the shock of finding the body!Judge:
Very well, Mr. Sahwit. Let's hear your testimony once more please.Witness Testimony-- Hearing the Time --Sahwit:
Actually, I didn't "hear" the time... I "saw" it!
There was a table clock in the apartment, wasn't there!
Yeah, the murder weapon! The killer used it to hit the victim!

2024-11-29 17:19:06 [INFO] HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2024-11-29 17:19:06 [INFO] Assistant reply: **Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Identify the Key Contradiction in the Testimony:**
   - The witness, Frank Sahwit, testified that he knew the exact time, 1:00 PM, when he found the body. He initially claimed that he heard the time from a television, but this statement was later contradicted due to the blackout at the victim’s apartment, which meant televisions and radios would not be working.

3. **Review the Evidence:**
   - Cindy's Autopsy Report: States the time of death between 4:00 PM and 5:00 PM.
   - Blackout Record: States the electricity was out from noon to 6:00 PM on the day of the crime in Cindy's building.

4. **Connect the Evidence to the Contradictory Testimony:**
   - The Blackout Record directly contradicts Frank Sahwit’s claim about hearing the time from a television when he discovered the body, as there was no power from noon to 6:00 PM.
   
5. **Final Step:**
   - Present the Blackout Record as evidence against the testimony where the witness claimed to have heard the time from a television.

**Conclusion:**

The contradiction exists in the statement "You see, when I found the body, I heard the time." from Sahwit's testimony regarding hearing the time, further emphasized in "There was a voice saying the time... It was probably coming from the television."

**Final Answer:**

The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say it was you...)Phoenix:\nMy name is Phoenix Wright. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\" In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!August 3, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.

Well, that's Larry Butz, Your Honor.Judge:\nCorrect. Just keep your wits about you and you'll do fine. Next question: This is a murder trial. Tell me, what's the victim's name?Phoenix:\n(Whew, I know this one! Glad I read the case report cover to cover so many times. It's... wait... Uh-oh! No... no way! I forgot! I'm drawing a total blank here!)Mia:\nPhoenix! Are you absolutely SURE you're up to this? You don't even know the victim's name!?Phoenix:\nOh, the victim! O-Of course I know the victim's name! I, um, just forgot. ...Temporarily (Changed from [I, um, just forgot. ... Temporarily.] in the original release)Mia:\nI think I feel a migraine coming on.

Now, tell me, what was the cause of death? She died because she was...?Poisoned\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\nOh, right! Wasn't she, um, poisoned by er... poison?\nJudge:\nYou're asking me!?\nPhoenix:\nUm... Chief! Help me out!\nMia:\nCheck the court record. [The R Button / Tab]... remember?

I suppose there's nothing to do but give you another try:\nLeads back to:\n\"She died because she was...?\"Phoenix:\nShe was struck once, by a blunt object.Judge:\nCorrect. You've answered all my questions. I see no reason why we shouldn't proceed. You seem much more relaxed, Mr. Wright. Good for you.Phoenix:\nThank you, Your Honor. (Because I don't FEEL relaxed, that's for sure.)Judge:\nWell, then... First, a question for the prosecution. Mr. Payne?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nAs Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to the court just what that \"object\" was?Payne:\nThe murder weapon was this statue of \"The Thinker.\" It was found lying on the floor, next to the victim.Judge:\nI see... The court accepts it into evidence. (Changed from [I see... the court accepts it into evidence.] in the original release)Statue added to the Court Record.Mia:\nWright... Be sure to pay attention to any evidence added during the trial. That evidence is the only ammunition you have in court. [Touch the Court Record button / Use the R Button] to check the Court Record frequently.Judge:\nMr. Payne, the prosecution may call its first witness.Payne:\nThe prosecution calls the defendant, Mr. Butz, to the stand.Phoenix:\nUm, Chief, what do I do now?Mia:\nPay attention. You don't want to miss any information that might help your client's case. You'll get your chance to respond to the prosecution later, so be ready! Let's just hope he doesn't say anything... unfortunate.Phoenix:\n(Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... This could be bad.) (Changed from [Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... this could be bad.] in the original release)Payne:\nAhem. Mr. Butz. Is it not true that the victim had recently dumped you?Butz:\nHey, watch it buddy! We were great together!

WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?Payne:\nMr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by \"dumped.\" In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!Butz:\nWhaddya mean, \"one of them\"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!Payne:\nYour Honor, the victim's passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.Passport added to the Court Record.Judge:\nHmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.Butz:\nDude... no way...Payne:\nThe victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several \"Sugar Daddies.\"Butz:\nDaddies? Sugar?Payne:\nYes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.Butz:\nDuuude!Payne:\nWe can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?Mia:\nWright... I don't think you want him to answer that question.Phoenix:\n(Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)Wait and see what happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Might be better not to get involved in this one...)\nPayne:\nWell, Mr. Butz?\nButz:\nDude, no way!

That question is irrelevant to this case!\nPayne:\nOof! *wince*\nButz:\nDude! Nick! Whaddya mean, \"irrelevant\"!? That cheatin' she-dog!\nLeads to:\n\"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!\"Butz:\nI'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I'm going to get to the bottom of this!Judge:\nLet's continue with the trial, shall we?Payne:\nI believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.Judge:\nYes, quite.Phoenix:\n(Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)Payne:\nNext question! You went to the victim's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?Butz:\nGulp!Payne:\nWell, did you, or did you not?Butz:\nHeh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn't!Phoenix:\n(Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)Have him answer honestly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I know! I'll send him a signal...)\n\n(TELL THE TRUTH)\n\nButz:\nEr... Yeah! Yeah! I was there! I went!\nJudge:\nOrder! Well, Mr. Butz?\nButz:\nDude, chill! She wasn't home, man... So, like, I didn't see her.\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nYour Honor, the defendant is lying.\nJudge:\nLying?\nPayne:\nThe prosecution would like to call a witness who can prove Mr. Butz is lying.\nLeads to:\n\"Well, that simplifies matters.

Well then, we'll just have to remind you!\nPhoenix:\n(I got a bad feeling about this...)\nPayne:\nWe have a witness that can prove he DID go to the victim's apartment that day!\nLeads to:\n\"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?\"Judge:\nWell, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?Payne:\nThe man who found the victim's body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw the defendant fleeing the scene of the crime!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.Payne:\nYes, Your Honor.Phoenix:\n(This is bad...)Payne:\nOn the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim's building. Please bring Mr. Frank Sahwit to the stand!Payne:\nMr. Sahwit, you sell newspaper subscriptions, is this correct?Sahwit:\nOh, oh yes! Newspapers, yes!Judge:\nMr. Sahwit, you may proceed with your testimony. Please tell the court what you saw on the day of the murder.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Sahwit:\nI was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.\nI thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.\nThinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.\nThen I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!\nI quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.\nI thought to call the police immediately!\nHowever, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.\nI went to a nearby park and found a public phone.\nI remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.\nThe man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Judge:\nHmm...Phoenix:\n(Larry! Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!)Judge:\nIncidentally, why wasn't the phone in the victim's apartment working?Payne:\nYour Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.Judge:\nAren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.Blackout Record added to the Court Record.Judge:\nNow, Mr. Wright...Phoenix:\nYes! Er... yes, Your Honor?Judge:\nYou may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:\nC-Cross-examination, Your Honor?Mia:\nAlright, Wright, this is it. The real deal!Phoenix:\nUh... what exactly am I supposed to do?Mia:\nWhy, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!Phoenix:\nLies! What?! He was lying!?Mia:\nYour client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?Phoenix:\n!!! How do I prove he's not?Mia:\nYou hold the key! It's in the evidence! Compare the witness's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there! First, find contradictions between the Court Record and the witness's testimony. Then, once you've found the contradicting evidence... present it and rub it in the witness's face!Phoenix:\nUm... okay.Mia:\nOpen the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab], then point out contradictions in the testimony! (Changed from [Touch the Court Record button and point out contradictions in the testimony!] in the original release)Cross Examination"

Sahwit: "I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him."
Sahwit: "Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment."
Sahwit: "Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!"
Sahwit: "I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside."
Sahwit: "I thought to call the police immediately!"
Sahwit: "However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working."
Sahwit: "I went to a nearby park and found a public phone."
Sahwit: "I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM."
Sahwit: "The man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there."
Question:

Mr. Payne?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nAs Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object.

I don't believe a word of it!Payne:\nYour Honor, the victim's passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.Passport added to the Court Record.Judge:\nHmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.Butz:\nDude... no way...Payne:\nThe victim was a model, but did not have a large income.

She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.Butz:\nDuuude!Payne:\nWe can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was.

He saw the defendant fleeing the scene of the crime!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.Payne:\nYes, Your Honor.Phoenix:\n(This is bad...)Payne:\nOn the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim's building.

Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!)Judge:\nIncidentally, why wasn't the phone in the victim's apartment working?Payne:\nYour Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.Judge:\nAren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.Blackout Record added to the Court Record.Judge:\nNow, Mr. Wright...Phoenix:\nYes!

The real deal!Phoenix:\nUh... what exactly am I supposed to do?Mia:\nWhy, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!Phoenix:\nLies! What?! He was lying!?Mia:\nYour client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?Phoenix:\n!!! How do I prove he's not?Mia:\nYou hold the key!

Oh, Nick! I didn't know you were here!Phoenix:
Of course I'm here! What was that surreal show you were watching?Maya:
What!? Nick, you mean, you don't know the Steel Samurai!? He's only the most popular TV hero for young people!Phoenix:
Young...? Like, how young?Maya:
Umm... 10 years old?Phoenix:
Then what the heck are YOU doing getting all excited!?Maya:
Hey! I'm only 17! That's seven-"teen." See? I'm a teen! Not like you, Nick.Phoenix:
Hey! Don't talk to me like I'm your grandpa or something. I'm only 24 myself.Maya:
Then watch it with me! He's really cool! And... it's really popular! When they asked grade school kids what they wanted to be, "Steel Samurai" was no. 1! ([no. 1] written as [no.1] in the original release)Phoenix:
I really worry about kids these days.Maya:
Gramps! Well, the Steel Samurai's over. I guess it's time to close up the office.Phoenix:
I guess... Wish we had some clients!Phoenix:

He was arrested on suspicion of murder. The victim was Jack Hammer, who plays the villain known as the "Evil Magistrate." His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. The "Samurai Spear" was also found stuck through the body. Police believe this was the murder weapon, and are investigating further.Phoenix:

Bookshelf







Phoenix:
There's a horrendous amount of legal books here. Scarier still is the thought that I have to read all of these now.




Houseplant







Phoenix:
Mia's favorite potted plant. Maya has been watering it so much lately it looks a little... swollen. She's either trying to make it grow... or she's perfecting her water torture technique.




Movie poster







Phoenix:
A poster of an old movie that Mia liked. I was thinking I should go see it myself. Then I realized that the poster doesn't actually say the title of the movie.




Desk







Phoenix:
Mia's desk. Actually... it's my desk now. Sitting here always makes me feel like a professional.




Window







Phoenix:
It's a nice day outside. The hotel across the way is always full these days. There's the bellboy, happily cleaning the room.Talk









What to do







Phoenix:
Well, what should we do?
Maya:
What should we do!? How can you just sit there like that!? We have to get down to the detention center and meet the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
(Does she want to investigate this case or just do some sightseeing, I wonder? My money's on sightseeing.)




Any ideas







Maya:
We don't have enough information to make a case yet.
Phoenix:
Just admit it: you don't have a clue what happened.
Maya:
No! We just don't have enough information!Present

What happened







Phoenix:
Maybe you could start by telling us what happened.
Will:
Y-yes. Of course. It seems like it was only yesterday. Actually, it was only yesterday. The cast had come down to Global Studios for a run-through. We went through a few action sequences at 10:00 that morning. There was a rehearsal scheduled for 5:00 in the afternoon. But when 5:00 came around, and the staff gathered at the studio... The Evil Magistrate was found lying in a crumpled heap near the set. They took off his mask... And discovered that it was Jack Hammer... dead! He had been expertly skewered with the Samurai Spear.
Phoenix:
The "Samurai Spear"...?
Will:
Yes, it's a long spear that I... that the Steel Samurai uses as a weapon.




The Steel Samurai







Phoenix:
Maybe you could explain to me just what "the Steel Samurai" is.
Maya:
Nick! How could you say such a thing? I-I'm sorry, sir, I apologize for my partner! He's new to this, and a bit OUT OF TOUCH with the world.
Phoenix:
Hey! Who's "new to this"!?
Will:
No, it's alright, really. The Steel Samurai is the lead character in a popular kid's show. He walks the streets of Neo Olde Tokyo... Fighting battle after battle against the Evil Magistrate and his minions. Of course, he never really defeats the Evil Magistrate. Although... I guess he did defeat him this time... *sniff* Uwaaah!
Phoenix:
I-I see. (Neo Olde Tokyo...? Who comes up with these names!?)




Powers's alibi (appears after "What happened")







Phoenix:
Now, where were you on the day of the murder?
Will:
Well, that morning I came to studios at 9:00. We worked through some action scenes until noon. Rehearsal was to begin at 5:00, but I was a little tired. So after lunch, I took a nap in my dressing room. When I woke up, it was after 5:00! I was late for the rehearsal! I hurried to the studio... and found everyone looking shocked. They arrested me on the spot, and brought me here.
Phoenix:
(So he was sleeping the entire afternoon of the murder? Some action hero!)
Will:
What will the kids think? *sniff*Present

Wasting your time at a place like this. Don't you have jobs you should be doing? Or do lawyers not work like the rest of us? Maybe I should become a lawyer too. Sounds like a life of ease to me no work just loafing around all day as you please. Well when I was young things were a mite different, mind you we didn't prance around in strange hippie clothes.

The studios







Phoenix:
So, what do you do here at the studios?
Oldbag:
At Global Studios, we make children's dreams come true! In fact, in my younger days...
Maya:
No! You were a star!?
Oldbag:
Only a little twinkle between the stars here, I'm afraid, dearie.
Maya:
Wo... wow.
Oldbag:
This place has really gone downhill, you know? But 10 years ago, now that was a studio of dreams! Hammer was a big star back then too, he was...
Phoenix:
Hammer...?
Oldbag:
The victim, dummy! The Evil Magistrate! He's been reduced to playing villains now. Not exactly the best material to work with...




Will Powers







Phoenix:
Can you tell me about Mr. Will Powers?
Oldbag:
He's not a bad kid, but don't be fooled by his mask! You wouldn't want him on the silver screen without it, believe me. Little old ladies watching would lose their lunch! That's probably why he thought that the Steel Samurai was his "big chance." No one thought he was capable of doing what he did to poor Jack Hammer...
Maya:
We don't know for certain that Will Powers is guilty!
Oldbag:
Powers? Of course he's guilty! How do I know? I know everything! That's my job.




Mr. Hammer (appears after "The studios")







Phoenix:
What kind of person was Jack Hammer?
Oldbag:
What "kind of person"? Oh... if you only knew! Jack Hammer will live on in many hearts as the ultimate action hero! He was simply dashing in the Dynamite Samurai series!
Phoenix:
(Should I have heard of that...?)
Oldbag:
But... there was an accident during filming five years ago. He got an unlucky break after that. Reduced to playing the villain on a children's program! What's more, I heard they were paying him peanuts. It's enough to make you cry.




Reason for suspicion (appears after "Will Powers")







Phoenix:
Why are you so certain Mr. Powers is the killer?
Oldbag:
I was standing right here yesterday, I was. I was here from 1:00 in the afternoon, to 5:00, when they found the body! Now the studio where the murder took place is to the left here. So if you want to go to the studio, you have to pass by me! Only one person went by here between 1:00 and 2:30, when the murder took place!
Phoenix:
And... that person was Mr. Powers?
Oldbag:
Yes. I saw him!
Phoenix:
But Mr. Powers says he was sleeping in his dressing room.

Oh, I'm sure he would say that. He's no fool! But he was the only one that walked by. He's the killer, you can bet your biscuits on it.Present

Your alibi







Phoenix:
Mr. Powers, you aren't hiding anything from me, are you?
Will:
W-what? No! I'd never do that!
Phoenix:
Just now you said that you were sleeping in your dressing room after lunch.
Will:
Yes. Like a baby.
Phoenix:
But the security lady said she saw you that day. She says she saw you heading towards the scene of the crime!
Will:
W-what!? That's not possible! I... I really don't know what to say! I was sleeping, I promise!
Phoenix:
Mr. Powers, if you want me to help you, you have to tell me the truth. I'm new to this lawyer business, and I need every advantage I can get.
Will:
I know... I-I'm sorry. *sniff* But, I swear to you on my momma's grave, I was sleeping. Maybe the security lady only thought she saw me?
Phoenix:
(What did she see...? He doesn't seem to be lying.)




The security lady







Phoenix:
Umm... about the security guard at the main gate to the studio...
Will:
Oh, the security lady?
Maya:
She's terrible! She called me "suspicious lookin'"!
Will:
Y-yes... actually, she's said the same thing to me before. "Take off that mask!" were her words, I believe. She sucks up to all the bigwigs at the studio... But let her see you stumble once and she'll never let up on you.

Bench

Hey, good idea, pal!
Maya:
Detective! Aren't you on the case?
Gumshoe:
W-well, yeah, but... Hey, us detectives get tired of standing around too, pal!




Left path







Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe, what's down the path to the left? It looks like a tree fell down over the path...?
Gumshoe:
Oh, yeah. That way's kind of dangerous. You should stay out, pal. There's nothing down there, anyway. That's where Studio Two used to be, they tell me. They don't use it now, though.




Statue with broken head







Phoenix:
The studio mascot. I guess it's a monkey of some kind. But what kind of monkey has a nose like that? He's holding a sign in his hand. [Right: To Studio One; Left: To Studio Two]

What's up with that thing!? It looks kind of... busted.
Gumshoe:
Oh, the wind was pretty strong yesterday, and the head broke off. It took that tree down with it, too.




Security camera







Phoenix:
Hey, there's a camera here.
Gumshoe:
That's the security camera. It takes photos of people going to the studio. All you have to do is look at the data and you can see who went where!
Phoenix:
There's a number plate on the camera... [ST1-307]. That must be the camera ID number.




Studio One entrance







Phoenix:
The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.
Maya:
Let's go in and check it out, Nick! ... Hey! It's locked!
Phoenix:
Looks like you need a cardkey to get in. It makes sense that they would want to keep the non-employees out.




Welcome sign







Maya:
There's a big welcome sign above the path.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, apparently the studio's fallen on tough times. They've started letting people in on days they aren't filming. They make a bit of extra money by charging for admission.
Maya:
Huh. You sure know a lot about this place, Detective. You know, you could always quit being a detective and work here?
Phoenix:
Yeah! And what perfect timing, with the monkey's neck broken and all.

The investigation

So, how is your investigation going, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Well, it's... Hey! I can't tell you that, pal.

Nick... Maybe you need to be a little more indirect with your questions?
Phoenix:
Right. So, Detective, mind if I take a look at what you got?

What I got?
Phoenix:
The autopsy report! The latest version, if you please...

So, how is your investigation going, Detective?
Gumshoe:
I'm not at liberty to give you any more information, pal. You'll hear all you need to know in court!
Phoenix:
(Oh well, it was worth a try.)




Reason for arrest







Phoenix:
Why was Mr. Powers arrested?
Gumshoe:
Simple, pal! The murder took place right over there in Studio One. Now, the victim entered Studio One at approximately 1:00 PM. At that time, there was no one other than the victim in the studio. According to the autopsy report, the time of death was 2:30 PM. Only one person went to the studio between 1:00 and 2:30! And that person was none other than Will Powers! No one else, pal! If you think I'm lying, ask the security lady at the main gate.
Maya:
Nick! If that's true...! Anyone would think that Powers did it with that kind of evidence!
Phoenix:
Thanks for cheering me up...




The security lady







Phoenix:
About the security lady...
Gumshoe:
Oh, that sweet old lady. What a charmer!
Phoenix:
Huh? A-are we talking about the same person?
Gumshoe:
When I showed her my badge she gave me a donut and some coffee!

Remember what Powers said. She's a sucker for authority.

She even gave me a piece of valuable evidence!

Decisive evidence (appears after "The security lady")







Phoenix:
What kind of evidence!?
Gumshoe:
Well, that, er, photo. The photo of the Steel Samurai heading toward the scene of the crime!
Maya:
What! Who took that!?
Gumshoe:

Maya:
The gate? You mean the one with the welcome sign?
Gumshoe:
Yeah. Whenever someone walks by, that camera automatically snaps a photo of them!

Attorney's Badge

Uh huh? Don'tcha think it's a little sad when you have to explain what your badge means, pal? Real men show their P.D. badge and that's that!
Phoenix:
I'll admit the design of my badge leaves a lot to be desired...
Maya:
Maybe it should just be a big "L" for "Lawyer"?
Phoenix:
Hmm... I'm not so sure about that.

Photographic proof







Phoenix:
Why didn't you tell us about the security photo, ma'am?
Oldbag:
Hmm? Oh, that? I just thought it would be more thrilling to talk with the detective himself! These things are important, you know. Oh, just to the left from here is the gate with the camera that took that photo. It's my job to check the photos every day, you see.




Reason for suspicion







Oldbag:
This guard station is in a central position. No matter where you go here, you pass by my station first! Now poor Hammer, he went to the studio just before 1:00. The murder happened right around 2:30, see? The only one I seen go through here between 1:00 and 2:30 was Powers himself! The security camera got a good look at him too. If he's not the one what did it, I don't know who is!
Phoenix:
Maybe... it was you?
Oldbag:
Gyah hah ha hah! Good one, sonny.
Phoenix:
(She thinks I was joking.)




Mr. Hammer







Phoenix:
Was the victim, Mr. Hammer, a popular actor?
Oldbag:
Oh, he was the biggest star in the studio!
Phoenix:
("Was"? Past tense?)
Maya:
Oh yes! He was great as the "Bearded Samurai"!
Oldbag:
That too, yes. He shone the brightest! Back in the day. Making a star like him play the "Evil Magistrate"... It's a disgrace, I tell you! Hammer took it pretty hard, and who can blame him?




Automatic camera (appears after "Photographic proof")







Phoenix:
About the security camera...
Oldbag:
Oh yes, the camera. It's automatic. It can tell when someone walks through that gate, see? Then it snaps a photo! Apparently, it records the time when it takes a picture too. But I don't bother myself with those details. I just view all the photos on the computer over in the security guard station. I check 'em every day before going home, I do.October 16Wright & Co.

What to do

What do you think?
Maya:
That photo the detective was talking about is the problem here.
Phoenix:
Well, that's hard to say, without seeing the actual photo ourselves. But if it is Powers in that photo, his alibi is shot.




Photographic proof







Phoenix:
Only one person went to the scene of the crime before the murder took place. And there's a photograph to prove it.
Maya:
I guess it makes sense that that person is the killer then. What do we do, Nick?
Phoenix:
Maybe there was someone else who could have gone to the scene other than Powers? Let's take a look. Maybe that security lady missed someone?

Drain grate







Phoenix:
The metal grate on the drain here has been taken off. That's a pretty big drain. A kid could fit through there, I bet.

Hey! Look! That's the chair the director sits in! I've always wanted to sit in one of these. Hey Nick, take a look at that. One of those black-and-white boards they clap at the start of filming! And look! A megaphone! A real live megaphone!
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
Ready, Nick? Action!
Phoenix:
(This girl is more troubled than I thought...)




Film camera







Leads to:
"Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!"




Reflecting screen







Maya:
What's this?
Phoenix:
That's for reflecting light. They call it a reflecting screen or something like that. The assistant holds it during filming.
Maya:
Huh.
Phoenix:
What? Where's your enthusiasm for all things entertainment?
Maya:
Well, lighting is fine, but I'd want to be the director. Or maybe the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
(I think she's being serious...!)




Stage backdrop







Phoenix:
Looks like a backdrop for a stage. This must be used in the Steel Samurai show.
Maya:
Of course! That's the mountain, Neo Fujiyama!
Phoenix:
Doesn't the Steel Samurai take place in Olde Tokyo? Can you even see Mt. Fuji from there?
Maya:
Not Olde Tokyo, Nick! "Neo" Olde Tokyo!
Phoenix:
Oh. Right.




(Step)ladder







Maya:
Look, a ladder!
Phoenix:
That's a "step"-ladder.
Maya:
So? What's the difference? You need to stop judging things based on narrow-minded cultural assumptions, Nick!
Phoenix:
R-right... sorry. (This girl is OUT there!)




Tape outline







Phoenix:
They outlined where Jack Hammer's body lay with tape. His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. I guess that's why the head part looks like a helmet. Funny, I expected a spear stabbing would leave at least a few bloodstains. I guess the costume must have absorbed most of it...Maya:
Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!Phoenix:
Yeah! So don't touch it!Maya:
Whoa! It's heavier than I thought...???:
Hey! You! No touching that!Phoenix:
Ah, um, sorry, my partner is kind of, y'know...Maya:
"Y'know"!? No I don't know!Phoenix:
Umm... who are you?Penny:
Who me? I'm an assistant here. I help with props and stuff. Moving them around, ordering new ones, et cetera.Maya:
We're lawyers representing Mr. Will Powers.Penny:
Oh, you're WP's people.Maya:
"WP"...? Oh, Will Powers. W.P., I get it.Penny:
I don't envy you guys one bit! But... do what you can for WP, okay? He'd never hurt a fly! He has to be innocent.Maya:
Don't worry, leave it to us!Talk









The day of the crime







Phoenix:
Could you tell me anything about the day of the murder?
Penny:
Yes. I was in the studio the whole day. I was the only assistant on staff that day, you see.
Maya:
Only one assistant!?
Penny:
Yes, well, the studios isn't doing so well right now. (Changed from [Yes, well, the studios aren't doing so well right now.] in the original release) And yesterday was only rehearsal for our action sequences.
Maya:
Oh, I see. (Changed from [I see. Neat!] in the original release)
Penny:
In the morning we went through the action sequences in the employee area. WP and Hammer were there, along with everyone else.
Phoenix:
The employee area--that's where Powers's dressing room is, right?
Penny:
Yes, that's the place. After eating lunch there, Mr. Hammer went to Studio One. Then I saw WP go into his dressing room. But I didn't see either of them after that.




Will Powers







Phoenix:
Did you know that Mr. Powers was sleeping in his room?
Penny:
No! I wouldn't go in there unless I had some urgent message for him... I mean, it's his private... What kind of a girl do you think I am!?
Phoenix:
W-what kind...? No, no, I'm sure you're a fine girl. Um, sorry. (So much for getting a confirmation of Powers's alibi.)Present









Anything







Phoenix:
Um, any thoughts about this?
Penny:
Sorry... I... don't really want to think too much about what happened just yet.After clearing all Talk options:Maya:
What do we do, Nick? We haven't found anything. If WP was the only one who came to the studio... Then he has to be the killer! They even have a photograph...Phoenix:
Hmm...Penny:
Umm... Sorry... I know you're busy.Phoenix:
Not really.Penny:
Actually, there's been something bothering me.Maya:
Ah hah! That's what I'm talking about! A clue! A lead!Penny:
Well, I don't know about that, but that day, just after noon, I sensed someone was here...Phoenix:
You "sensed"?Penny:
Yes, several times.Phoenix:
Some other studio employees, maybe?Penny:
No, I don't think so. The only thing we had scheduled was an action scene run-through. I was the only assistant here that day. I have a feeling it was someone from... outside.Phoenix:
R-really!?Maya:
But wait, if someone had come in here... Wouldn't that security lady have noticed them?Phoenix:
Yeah, you're right.Penny:
I'm sorry I don't have any better information than that.Maya:
No, thanks! That helps us a lot. Anything helps. Let's go put that security lady on the spot!Talk









Sensing someone







Phoenix:
So you sensed that someone other than the regular film crew was in the studio?
Penny:
Yes... I think.
Phoenix:
("I think" doesn't cut it in a witness testimony.)
Maya:
Nick! What about that security lady! If someone else came into the studio, she must have seen them!October 16Global StudiosMain GateOldbag:
What? You're still here? Really! You look as though you've seen a ghost!Talk









Assistant's claim







Leads to:
"What? I saw that suspicious look on your face!"Oldbag:
What? I saw that suspicious look on your face!Phoenix:
I wanted to ask you again about yesterday... You came here at 1:00 PM, correct? And the estimated time of Hammer's death was 2:30. Are you sure that Powers was the only one to go through here between those times?Oldbag:
Sure as can be!Maya:
But we have a witness who thinks there was "someone from outside" here that day.Oldbag:
What!?Maya:
Are you absolutely sure you were here watching the whole time?Oldbag:
...Maya:
Ma'am?Oldbag:
Who was it? Who told you that? Who dares question ME!?Maya:
Eek!Oldbag:
Alright you better tell me and tell me quick, you spiky-haired cretin! Someone's been complaining about the work I do, eh!?Maya:
Uh... um, we were just talking to the assistant in Studio One.Oldbag:
Her! She's not even a full-time employee! All you young'uns are like that nowadays, running your mouths like there was no tomorrow saying this that and the other thing. Well when I was young let me tell you we knew a thing or two about respecting our elders. Back then we did and it's a crying shame that you youths today just say what you please about poor old ladies Graaaaaaaaaaaawr!Phoenix:
She left...Maya:
Well, Nick? This is our chance to do what we can without her looking over our shoulders!Examine









Computer







Phoenix:
The computer that runs the studio security cameras.
Maya:
Nick! Maybe we can see that photo of Powers with this computer!
Phoenix:
Yeah, maybe. (Should I try the computer?)



Try it







Phoenix:
Okay. Let's give it a try.
Maya:
You know how to work these things, Nick?
Phoenix:
Looks like I just have to enter in a few numbers. Let's see... first, I need the date of the murder. (It looks like the camera turned on at 1:00 PM that day... 1:00... That was when the security lady arrived at the guard station.)
[Please enter the number of the security camera.]



ST1-703







Phoenix:
There! Entered!
Maya:
... ... Nothing happened.
Phoenix:
Huh? Maybe I got the number wrong.
Maya:
*sigh* Maybe we should go look at that camera again?

Leave it alone







Phoenix:
(Hmm... I'd better not fool around with this, or that security lady will get me. Maybe next time.)
Maya:
What? You're not going to look at it? Bo-ring!
Leads back to examinationPhoenix:
There! Entered! ...Maya:
Hey! It printed out the data for that day!Phoenix:
Let's see what we got... ... Huh?Maya:
How is this a picture of Will Powers?Phoenix:
Well, he is the one who always wears that suit... I guess that's why the security lady thought it was him.Maya:
I don't imagine the detective was very happy with this photo as evidence. Hmm? Something's printed on the back.Phoenix:
Huh? [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2]Maya:
What does that mean?Phoenix:
Maybe there's more photo data from that day?Maya:
Nope--that's the only one in the computer.Powers's{?} Photo added to the Court Record.Maya:
Hey, hey, Nick! Can't we use this photo as evidence for the trial?Phoenix:
Yeah.Maya:
We'll put that security lady in her place with this!Phoenix:
Right, we'll put her in her place...Maya:
Hey, that's what I said! Anyway... Let's show her this photo and see what she says!Phoenix:
Wait. Let's not.Maya:
Why not?Phoenix:
It's never a good idea to reveal your hand to the enemy too soon.Maya:
Nick! You're craftier than I gave you credit for. Why, you could be the next... Evil Magistrate!Phoenix:
Hey! Why do I have to be the villain.Maya:
Relax, it was just a joke! So, are we done for today?Phoenix:
I think this photo is what we needed for the trial. Still, it'd be better if we had some idea who the real killer was! Maybe it really is that security lady...?To be continued.Before selecting "ST1-307" upon examining computer in Global Studios - Main Gate:October 16Studio OneMaya:
No one's here. I wonder if the security lady got mad at that assistant?Phoenix:
Hmm. That's definitely a possibility.Nothing to examine during investigation

Part 6October 18, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:
Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth:
The prosecution will show the court that at 2:30 PM on October 15, the defendant, Mr. Will Powers, killed fellow actor Jack Hammer at Studio One of Global Studios. It is impossible for anyone else to have committed this heinous crime. The evidence presented during the trial will all point to this fact.Judge:
Hmm. I see. Very well, I would like to move on to your testimony. Mr. Edgeworth, the prosecution may call its first witness.Edgeworth:
Very well, I call a most familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand. (Changed from [First, I would like to call a familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand.] in the original release)Edgeworth:
Detective, if you would briefly describe this case to the court?Gumshoe:
Yes sir! I'll explain with the guidemap here. To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see? This here is the Employee Area. The actors did a run-through of their action scenes during the morning here. This is the main gate to the studios. The security lady that works at the studios was here at 1:00 PM on that day. Past the security station there is a gate, see? Past that are the studios. And here it is... Studio One. This is the scene of the murder, where the body was found! Now, on the day of the murder, October 15, there were only three people here. The victim, Jack Hammer, the defendant, Will Powers, and a young woman, the production assistant. All the production staff were in the Employee Area until noon. Then after lunch, the victim, Jack Hammer, went to Studio One. Right after that, at 1:00 PM, the security lady got to the guard station. Now, jump ahead to later that day... 5:00 PM. The production staff came to Studio One to perform a rehearsal. Needless to say, the rehearsal was cancelled... The time of death was 2:30 PM. The "Samurai Spear" found lodged in the victim's chest was the murder weapon. That's the case, in brief. Anyone like to hear that again?Phoenix:
(Hmm... should I listen to that whole thing again...?)Skip it







Leads to:
"I think I can probably remember that..."Listen again







Phoenix:
I'm sorry, could you describe that one more time?
Gumshoe:
I shoulda known it would be you, pal! Fine. Once more for the mentally-challenged lawyer.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, yeah. Live it up while you can, Gumshoe.)
Leads back to:
"To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see?"Phoenix:
(I think I can probably remember that...)Judge:
So the murder weapon was a "spear"? How... medieval!Samurai Spear added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:
Your Honor. This case is quite simple if you ask one question: And that question is: "What did the security lady at the guard station see?"Judge:
Understood.Edgeworth:
Let's call this security officer to the stand!Edgeworth:
Will the witness declare her name?Oldbag:
... Hmm? My, aren't you a handsome fellow! I'm afraid I'm a bit flustered!Edgeworth:
Y-your name, please!Oldbag:
Oh, dearie! No need for you to be embarrassed! Just call me "grandma."Edgeworth:
YOUR NAME, PLEASE!Phoenix:
(Seems Edgeworth has a bit of trouble getting his witnesses to say their names...)Oldbag:
Wendy Oldbag, dearie. So just call me "grandma." It's practically my name! So even when I was young I was an Oldbag, but not really that was just my name dearie. Still how the other children would make fun of me and just because of my name can you believe it? But there was this boy, the captain of the chess club in junior high, and when he called me an old bag well I just cried and cried because I had a crush on him you see--Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
O-objection! I... object to the witness's talkativeness.Judge:
Objection sustained! The witness will refrain from rambling on the stand.Oldbag:
I was just getting to the good part, dearie!Edgeworth:
Perhaps we can get to the testimony?Judge:
Now, the witness was stationed at the main gate on the day of the murder, correct?Oldbag:
Yessey I was.Judge:
And to get to the scene of the murder, someone would have to pass by you?Oldbag:
You know your stuff, dearie!Judge:
... You may begin your testimony.Phoenix:
(She sure is one hell of an Oldbag...)Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Oldbag:
On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.
Poor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.
I, well, I had some errands to run that morning.
Anyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.
I was at the main gate from then until 5:00!
Now, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?
Interesting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.
It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!Judge:
You saw the defendant, then? Hmm... Very well. Let's begin the cross-examination. Mr. Wright?Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.Cross Examination

2024-11-29 17:19:14 [INFO] Assistant reply: To identify the contradiction in the witness's testimony presented by Oldbag, let's examine her statements and compare them with the evidence available.

1. **Testimony**: On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.
2. **Testimony**: Poor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.
3. **Testimony**: I, well, I had some errands to run that morning.
4. **Testimony**: Anyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.
5. **Testimony**: I was at the main gate from then until 5:00!
6. **Testimony**: Now, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?
7. **Testimony**: Interesting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.
8. **Testimony**: It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!

The key statement to focus on is testimony number 7, where Oldbag claims she saw the defendant Will Powers walk toward the studio at 2:00 PM. Examining the evidence, we have "Mr. Monkey's Head" (evidence index 11), which states: "Blocked the path to the scene of the crime between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM." This means that the path to Studio One should have been inaccessible during that time due to the fallen head blocking it. If this was the case, then Will Powers could not have passed by Oldbag and used that route as claimed in her testimony.

Given this evidence, there's a contradiction in her testimony regarding Will Powers walking at 2:00 PM towards the studio since the path was blocked shortly after. This casts doubt on Powers being able to proceed to the scene of the crime.

Therefore, we should present "Mr. Monkey's Head" to highlight this contradiction in the testimony.

Actually, it's because I owe him a favor.Mia:\nA favor? You mean, you knew the defendant before this case?Phoenix:\nYes. Actually, I kind of owe my current job to him.

A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\" In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!August 3, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.

One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one.

Oh, Nick! I didn't know you were here!Phoenix:
Of course I'm here! What was that surreal show you were watching?Maya:
What!? Nick, you mean, you don't know the Steel Samurai!? He's only the most popular TV hero for young people!Phoenix:
Young...? Like, how young?Maya:
Umm... 10 years old?Phoenix:
Then what the heck are YOU doing getting all excited!?Maya:
Hey! I'm only 17! That's seven-"teen." See? I'm a teen! Not like you, Nick.Phoenix:
Hey! Don't talk to me like I'm your grandpa or something. I'm only 24 myself.Maya:
Then watch it with me! He's really cool! And... it's really popular! When they asked grade school kids what they wanted to be, "Steel Samurai" was no. 1! ([no. 1] written as [no.1] in the original release)Phoenix:
I really worry about kids these days.Maya:
Gramps! Well, the Steel Samurai's over. I guess it's time to close up the office.Phoenix:
I guess... Wish we had some clients!Phoenix:
A month has passed since my trial. Mia's murder was the talk of the town for some time... But no one paid any attention to the Wright & Co. Law Offices... How am I going to pay the rent this month?Maya:

Now for the morning news. The actor Will Powers was arrested yesterday. Powers plays the lead role in the popular kid's show "The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo." He was arrested on suspicion of murder. The victim was Jack Hammer, who plays the villain known as the "Evil Magistrate." His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. The "Samurai Spear" was also found stuck through the body. Police believe this was the murder weapon, and are investigating further.Phoenix:
... This has to be a joke.Maya:
No, no, no! It's a nightmare! The Steel Samurai is over! The world is over!Cellular:

Bookshelf







Phoenix:
There's a horrendous amount of legal books here. Scarier still is the thought that I have to read all of these now.




Houseplant







Phoenix:
Mia's favorite potted plant. Maya has been watering it so much lately it looks a little... swollen. She's either trying to make it grow... or she's perfecting her water torture technique.




Movie poster







Phoenix:
A poster of an old movie that Mia liked. I was thinking I should go see it myself. Then I realized that the poster doesn't actually say the title of the movie.




Desk







Phoenix:
Mia's desk. Actually... it's my desk now. Sitting here always makes me feel like a professional.




Window







Phoenix:
It's a nice day outside. The hotel across the way is always full these days. There's the bellboy, happily cleaning the room.Talk









What to do







Phoenix:
Well, what should we do?
Maya:
What should we do!? How can you just sit there like that!? We have to get down to the detention center and meet the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
(Does she want to investigate this case or just do some sightseeing, I wonder? My money's on sightseeing.)




Any ideas







Maya:
We don't have enough information to make a case yet.
Phoenix:
Just admit it: you don't have a clue what happened.
Maya:
No! We just don't have enough information!Present

Phoenix:
What about this?
Maya:
You like showing that off, don't you, Nick?
Phoenix:

Anything else







Phoenix:
What about this?

Sorry, but I don't see how that will help us figure this out...October 16Detention CenterVisitor's RoomMaya:

What's wrong, Maya? It's him! In the flesh!Maya:
Umm... Is that guy really him?Phoenix:
Whaddya mean "that guy"? Of course it's him! Will Powers, our client! That's him.Maya:
Um, maybe I shouldn't be saying this... But he definitely did it. Murder. At least once. Maybe twice.Phoenix:
Whoa whoa whoa! What are you saying!?Will:
Umm...Maya:
Y-yes!?Will:
Something wrong...?Maya:
N-no! No!Phoenix:
(This is getting off to a great start.)Will:
I know, I know. You're disappointed, aren't you?Maya:
D-disappointed!? Oh, no. Oh no.Will:
No, it's okay. This is the real me. When I got the part of the Steel Samurai, with that mask... I decided I would never show my face in public until the job was over. It's the kids, you know. I didn't want to wreck their dreams.Maya:
Oh...Will:
I guess it didn't matter. So much for dreams. I wonder what they think of the Steel Samurai now. *sniff* Uwaaah!Maya:

Security camera







Phoenix:
Smile for the camera...




Security guard







Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He seems frozen in awe of Will Powers.Talk









What happened







Phoenix:
Maybe you could start by telling us what happened.
Will:
Y-yes. Of course. It seems like it was only yesterday. Actually, it was only yesterday. The cast had come down to Global Studios for a run-through. We went through a few action sequences at 10:00 that morning. There was a rehearsal scheduled for 5:00 in the afternoon. But when 5:00 came around, and the staff gathered at the studio... The Evil Magistrate was found lying in a crumpled heap near the set. They took off his mask... And discovered that it was Jack Hammer... dead! He had been expertly skewered with the Samurai Spear.
Phoenix:
The "Samurai Spear"...?
Will:
Yes, it's a long spear that I... that the Steel Samurai uses as a weapon.




The Steel Samurai







Phoenix:
Maybe you could explain to me just what "the Steel Samurai" is.
Maya:
Nick! How could you say such a thing? I-I'm sorry, sir, I apologize for my partner! He's new to this, and a bit OUT OF TOUCH with the world.
Phoenix:
Hey! Who's "new to this"!?
Will:
No, it's alright, really. The Steel Samurai is the lead character in a popular kid's show. He walks the streets of Neo Olde Tokyo... Fighting battle after battle against the Evil Magistrate and his minions. Of course, he never really defeats the Evil Magistrate. Although... I guess he did defeat him this time... *sniff* Uwaaah!
Phoenix:
I-I see. (Neo Olde Tokyo...? Who comes up with these names!?)




Powers's alibi (appears after "What happened")







Phoenix:
Now, where were you on the day of the murder?
Will:
Well, that morning I came to studios at 9:00. We worked through some action scenes until noon. Rehearsal was to begin at 5:00, but I was a little tired. So after lunch, I took a nap in my dressing room. When I woke up, it was after 5:00! I was late for the rehearsal! I hurried to the studio... and found everyone looking shocked. They arrested me on the spot, and brought me here.
Phoenix:
(So he was sleeping the entire afternoon of the murder? Some action hero!)
Will:
What will the kids think? *sniff*Present

Phoenix:
Um, here.
Will:
I... I see. ...
Phoenix:
(Let me guess... this guy wasn't the top student in improv class.)




Anything else







Will:
I-I'm sorry. I'm sure that's very important and all. I just don't see what it has to do with my problem.After clearing "Powers's alibi" Talk option:Phoenix:
I think I should probably check out the scene of the murder...Will:
Right... Global Studios. I'll draw you a map.Maya:

What to do







Phoenix:
Well, what should we do?
Maya:
Sitting around here won't get us anywhere, that's for sure. The studio! We should go to the studio! I'm sure we could find some clues there!
Phoenix:
(Does she want to investigate this case or just do some sightseeing, I wonder? My money's on sightseeing.)October 16Global StudiosMain GateMaya:
Wow! So this is where they make the Steel Samurai show! Awesome! Aren't you excited!?Oldbag:
Hey! You there! You want in, you gotta go through me!Maya:
O-oh... s-sorry! W-we're, um, lawyers.Oldbag:
Oh yeah? Well that's great. I'm security! And it's my job to make sure that gawkers like you stay OUT.Maya:
G-gawkers?Oldbag:
Gawkers! Sightseers! Tourists!!! I know the type. You heard about the incident and came to snoop around. Youths today! Something horrible happens and all you can think of is sightseeing. Wasting your time at a place like this. Don't you have jobs you should be doing? Or do lawyers not work like the rest of us? Maybe I should become a lawyer too. Sounds like a life of ease to me no work just loafing around all day as you please. Well when I was young things were a mite different, mind you we didn't prance around in strange hippie clothes. What are the youths coming to these days my own son hasn't called in...Maya:
Umm... Nick? Will I grow up to be like her? Please say "no."Phoenix:
I dunno! It's possible.Oldbag:
Hey! Listen when you're being spoken to! Youths today!Examine









Computer







Phoenix:
The computer that runs the studio security cameras.
Oldbag:
Hey! No touching!




Guard station







Phoenix:
The security guard station. That security lady must like junk food. There's a mountain of it on the desk in there. I can see the computer that runs the security cameras.




Main gate







Phoenix:
The main entrance to the studio. There was a big scene here yesterday with onlookers pressing up against the gate.




Studio map







Phoenix:
An overhead map of the studios. Right from here is the Employee Area. To the left are the actual film studios.




Studio van







Phoenix:
Looks like a studio van. They probably use it to carry around film equipment.Talk









The studios







Phoenix:
So, what do you do here at the studios?
Oldbag:
At Global Studios, we make children's dreams come true! In fact, in my younger days...
Maya:
No! You were a star!?
Oldbag:
Only a little twinkle between the stars here, I'm afraid, dearie.
Maya:
Wo... wow.
Oldbag:
This place has really gone downhill, you know? But 10 years ago, now that was a studio of dreams! Hammer was a big star back then too, he was...
Phoenix:
Hammer...?
Oldbag:
The victim, dummy! The Evil Magistrate! He's been reduced to playing villains now. Not exactly the best material to work with...




Will Powers







Phoenix:
Can you tell me about Mr. Will Powers?
Oldbag:
He's not a bad kid, but don't be fooled by his mask! You wouldn't want him on the silver screen without it, believe me. Little old ladies watching would lose their lunch! That's probably why he thought that the Steel Samurai was his "big chance." No one thought he was capable of doing what he did to poor Jack Hammer...
Maya:
We don't know for certain that Will Powers is guilty!
Oldbag:
Powers? Of course he's guilty! How do I know? I know everything! That's my job.




Mr. Hammer (appears after "The studios")







Phoenix:
What kind of person was Jack Hammer?
Oldbag:
What "kind of person"? Oh... if you only knew! Jack Hammer will live on in many hearts as the ultimate action hero! He was simply dashing in the Dynamite Samurai series!
Phoenix:
(Should I have heard of that...?)
Oldbag:
But... there was an accident during filming five years ago. He got an unlucky break after that. Reduced to playing the villain on a children's program! What's more, I heard they were paying him peanuts. It's enough to make you cry.




Reason for suspicion (appears after "Will Powers")







Phoenix:
Why are you so certain Mr. Powers is the killer?
Oldbag:
I was standing right here yesterday, I was. I was here from 1:00 in the afternoon, to 5:00, when they found the body! Now the studio where the murder took place is to the left here. So if you want to go to the studio, you have to pass by me! Only one person went by here between 1:00 and 2:30, when the murder took place!
Phoenix:
And... that person was Mr. Powers?
Oldbag:
Yes. I saw him!
Phoenix:
But Mr. Powers says he was sleeping in his dressing room.
Oldbag:
Oh, I'm sure he would say that. He's no fool! But he was the only one that walked by. He's the killer, you can bet your biscuits on it.Present









Anything







Oldbag:
What's that? You giving that to me?
Phoenix:
(Absolutely not!)After clearing all Talk options:Oldbag:
Isn't it about time for you to be heading home? There's nothing to see here. Move along.Phoenix:
Um, actually, we're here at Mr. Powers's request.Oldbag:
Hmph! I thought you were suspicious lookin'! Show me a "letter of request." And maybe I'll just let you in.Maya:
This lady here thinks she owns this place, obviously.Detention CenterWill:
Hello! How was the studio? They all think I did it, don't they?Maya:
N-no, not at all! Isn't that right, Nick?Phoenix:
Right, not at all. At worst, you're a suspect.Will:
*sniff*Talk









Your alibi







Phoenix:
Mr. Powers, you aren't hiding anything from me, are you?
Will:
W-what? No! I'd never do that!
Phoenix:
Just now you said that you were sleeping in your dressing room after lunch.
Will:
Yes. Like a baby.
Phoenix:
But the security lady said she saw you that day. She says she saw you heading towards the scene of the crime!
Will:
W-what!? That's not possible! I... I really don't know what to say! I was sleeping, I promise!
Phoenix:
Mr. Powers, if you want me to help you, you have to tell me the truth. I'm new to this lawyer business, and I need every advantage I can get.
Will:
I know... I-I'm sorry. *sniff* But, I swear to you on my momma's grave, I was sleeping. Maybe the security lady only thought she saw me?
Phoenix:
(What did she see...? He doesn't seem to be lying.)




The security lady







Phoenix:
Umm... about the security guard at the main gate to the studio...
Will:
Oh, the security lady?
Maya:
She's terrible! She called me "suspicious lookin'"!
Will:
Y-yes... actually, she's said the same thing to me before. "Take off that mask!" were her words, I believe. She sucks up to all the bigwigs at the studio... But let her see you stumble once and she'll never let up on you.
Maya:
Grr! She's got some nerve!
Phoenix:
Do you think you could write up a letter formally requesting my representation?
Will:
Of c-course.
Powers's Request added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(I just hope this will get me past that security lady.)

Ma'am, have a look at this. It's a letter of request from Mr. Powers.Oldbag:

Bench







Phoenix:
I'm a little bushed. Maybe I'll take a short rest here.
Gumshoe:
Hey, good idea, pal!
Maya:
Detective! Aren't you on the case?
Gumshoe:
W-well, yeah, but... Hey, us detectives get tired of standing around too, pal!




Left path







Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe, what's down the path to the left? It looks like a tree fell down over the path...?
Gumshoe:
Oh, yeah. That way's kind of dangerous. You should stay out, pal. There's nothing down there, anyway. That's where Studio Two used to be, they tell me. They don't use it now, though.




Statue with broken head







Phoenix:
The studio mascot. I guess it's a monkey of some kind. But what kind of monkey has a nose like that? He's holding a sign in his hand. [Right: To Studio One; Left: To Studio Two]
Maya:
What's up with that thing!? It looks kind of... busted.
Gumshoe:
Oh, the wind was pretty strong yesterday, and the head broke off. It took that tree down with it, too.




Security camera







Phoenix:
Hey, there's a camera here.
Gumshoe:
That's the security camera. It takes photos of people going to the studio. All you have to do is look at the data and you can see who went where!
Phoenix:
There's a number plate on the camera... [ST1-307]. That must be the camera ID number.




Studio One entrance







Phoenix:
The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.
Maya:
Let's go in and check it out, Nick! ... Hey! It's locked!
Phoenix:
Looks like you need a cardkey to get in. It makes sense that they would want to keep the non-employees out.




Welcome sign







Maya:
There's a big welcome sign above the path.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, apparently the studio's fallen on tough times. They've started letting people in on days they aren't filming. They make a bit of extra money by charging for admission.
Maya:
Huh. You sure know a lot about this place, Detective. You know, you could always quit being a detective and work here?
Phoenix:
Yeah! And what perfect timing, with the monkey's neck broken and all.
Gumshoe:
Huh? Just what's that supposed to mean, pal!?Talk









The investigation







Phoenix:
So, how is your investigation going, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Well, it's... Hey! I can't tell you that, pal.
Maya:
Nick... Maybe you need to be a little more indirect with your questions?
Phoenix:
Right. So, Detective, mind if I take a look at what you got?
Gumshoe:
What I got?
Phoenix:
The autopsy report! The latest version, if you please...
Gumshoe:
Hmm... right, right. Sorry about what happened last time, pal.
Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.




The investigation (subsequent times)







Phoenix:
So, how is your investigation going, Detective?
Gumshoe:
I'm not at liberty to give you any more information, pal. You'll hear all you need to know in court!
Phoenix:
(Oh well, it was worth a try.)




Reason for arrest







Phoenix:
Why was Mr. Powers arrested?
Gumshoe:
Simple, pal! The murder took place right over there in Studio One. Now, the victim entered Studio One at approximately 1:00 PM. At that time, there was no one other than the victim in the studio. According to the autopsy report, the time of death was 2:30 PM. Only one person went to the studio between 1:00 and 2:30! And that person was none other than Will Powers! No one else, pal! If you think I'm lying, ask the security lady at the main gate.
Maya:
Nick! If that's true...! Anyone would think that Powers did it with that kind of evidence!
Phoenix:
Thanks for cheering me up...




The security lady







Phoenix:
About the security lady...
Gumshoe:
Oh, that sweet old lady. What a charmer!
Phoenix:
Huh? A-are we talking about the same person?
Gumshoe:
When I showed her my badge she gave me a donut and some coffee!
Maya:
Remember what Powers said. She's a sucker for authority.
Gumshoe:
She even gave me a piece of valuable evidence!
Maya:
Whaat!?




Decisive evidence (appears after "The security lady")







Phoenix:
What kind of evidence!?
Gumshoe:
Well, that, er, photo. The photo of the Steel Samurai heading toward the scene of the crime!
Maya:
What! Who took that!?
Gumshoe:
See the camera up on that gate, pal?
Maya:
The gate? You mean the one with the welcome sign?
Gumshoe:
Yeah. Whenever someone walks by, that camera automatically snaps a photo of them!
Maya:
Oh no! Nick, he has evidence! We're finished!
Phoenix:
(Funny, for someone with hard proof he doesn't look too happy.)
Gumshoe:
...Present









Attorney's Badge







Phoenix:
Detective, see this? This is my attorney's badge.
Gumshoe:
Uh huh? Don'tcha think it's a little sad when you have to explain what your badge means, pal? Real men show their P.D. badge and that's that!
Phoenix:
I'll admit the design of my badge leaves a lot to be desired...
Maya:
Maybe it should just be a big "L" for "Lawyer"?
Phoenix:
Hmm... I'm not so sure about that.




Anything else







Phoenix:
Um, Detective. Any ideas about this?
Gumshoe:
Look, I don't got time to look at every little trinket you got, okay pal?After clearing "The investigation" and "Decisive evidence" Talk options:Gumshoe:
What's wrong, pal? You seem down.Phoenix:
Don't look so happy when you say that.Gumshoe:
Oh hoh hoh hoh hoh!Maya:
Umm... We'd like to ask the employees here some questions...Gumshoe:
Sure thing, pal. Go wherever you like. Of course, you're not going to find any clues I haven't already found! Hah hah hah!Phoenix:
(I'm glad someone around here seems to be enjoying themselves.)Maya:
Nick, let's go! We've got a free pass to the place. Now's our chance to check things out!Studio - Main GateMaya:
Nick! Look! That security lady is in the guard station stuffing her face with donuts! I guess all cops like their donuts!Phoenix:
Yeah, and they're soft enough she doesn't need teeth to chew them...Oldbag:
Hey, you! Well? Are you satisfied Powers is guilty yet?Phoenix:
(Urk! She had to make my life harder by giving that photo to Detective Gumshoe...)Talk









Photographic proof







Phoenix:
Why didn't you tell us about the security photo, ma'am?
Oldbag:
Hmm? Oh, that? I just thought it would be more thrilling to talk with the detective himself! These things are important, you know. Oh, just to the left from here is the gate with the camera that took that photo. It's my job to check the photos every day, you see.




Reason for suspicion







Oldbag:
This guard station is in a central position. No matter where you go here, you pass by my station first! Now poor Hammer, he went to the studio just before 1:00. The murder happened right around 2:30, see? The only one I seen go through here between 1:00 and 2:30 was Powers himself! The security camera got a good look at him too. If he's not the one what did it, I don't know who is!
Phoenix:
Maybe... it was you?
Oldbag:
Gyah hah ha hah! Good one, sonny.
Phoenix:
(She thinks I was joking.)




Mr. Hammer







Phoenix:
Was the victim, Mr. Hammer, a popular actor?
Oldbag:
Oh, he was the biggest star in the studio!
Phoenix:
("Was"? Past tense?)
Maya:
Oh yes! He was great as the "Bearded Samurai"!
Oldbag:
That too, yes. He shone the brightest! Back in the day. Making a star like him play the "Evil Magistrate"... It's a disgrace, I tell you! Hammer took it pretty hard, and who can blame him?




Automatic camera (appears after "Photographic proof")







Phoenix:
About the security camera...
Oldbag:
Oh yes, the camera. It's automatic. It can tell when someone walks through that gate, see? Then it snaps a photo! Apparently, it records the time when it takes a picture too. But I don't bother myself with those details. I just view all the photos on the computer over in the security guard station. I check 'em every day before going home, I do.October 16Wright & Co. Law OfficesMaya:
What's going on, Nick!? Powers said he was sleeping in his dressing room! But now there's a photo of him going to the studio!?Phoenix:
Don't look at me! How should I know?Talk









What to do







Phoenix:
What do you think?
Maya:
That photo the detective was talking about is the problem here.
Phoenix:
Well, that's hard to say, without seeing the actual photo ourselves. But if it is Powers in that photo, his alibi is shot.




Photographic proof







Phoenix:
Only one person went to the scene of the crime before the murder took place. And there's a photograph to prove it.
Maya:
I guess it makes sense that that person is the killer then. What do we do, Nick?
Phoenix:
Maybe there was someone else who could have gone to the scene other than Powers? Let's take a look. Maybe that security lady missed someone?
Maya:
On thing's for sure, if there are any clues, they'll be in that studio.October 16Detention CenterVisitor's RoomPhoenix:
...Maya:
Apparently they have Mr. Powers in questioning.Phoenix:
Hmm... right.Gumshoe:
Look pal, that camera takes a picture automatically whenever someone walks by. And it took a picture of Will Powers!Phoenix:
I have to ask him about that photograph!Maya:
Oh well. Let's try again later.Examine









Security guard







Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He must get pretty bored. I bet he's making funny faces at that camera.October 16Global StudiosEmployee AreaMaya:
Nick! This is where they do all the behind-the-scenes stuff! Hey! Look! There's Powers's dressing room! No one's here this soon after the murder I guess. Let's take a look around!Examine









Bicycle







Phoenix:
Looks like one of those electric-powered bicycles. I dunno about these. I mean, what's the point?
Maya:
It makes it a lot easier to go up hills!
Phoenix:
Don't people cycle to get exercise!?




Drain grate







Phoenix:
The metal grate on the drain here has been taken off. That's a pretty big drain. A kid could fit through there, I bet.
Maya:
Yeah, if you snuck in that way you wouldn't have to pay at the gate!
Phoenix:
Well, if you want to leave that way, be my guest.
Maya:
Right! Huh? Hey! I'm not a kid!




Grate







Phoenix:
The grate that used to cover the drain. It's a little bent. I don't think it would fit if I tried to put it back on.




Lunch table







Phoenix:
The remains of yesterday's lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak.
Maya:
Mmm! T-bone steak! That would have hit the spot.
Phoenix:
You just had a burger!
Maya:
Yeah, but I have a second stomach just for steaks.
Phoenix:
(What!?)




Stage backdrop







Phoenix:
There's a half-finished backdrop for a stage here. Looks like a castle. Probably "Neo Olde Tokyo Castle."




Dressing room door







Phoenix:
The door to the dressing room. It's not locked.
Maya:
Hey, Nick! Let's take a look inside! Maybe we can find something as a souvenir...?
Phoenix:
What do you mean "find"!?
Maya:
You never know! There might be something like... the Samurai Spear!
Phoenix:
We don't need a spear! (And that's the murder weapon for crying out loud!)




Dressing room sign







Phoenix:
There's a sign on the dressing room door. "Mr. Will Powers"... it must be neat to be the star and have your own room like this.




Dressing room window







Phoenix:
A window into the dressing room. The glass is frosted, so I can't see inside.




Storage room door







Phoenix:
That must be the storage room. That's where they keep all the film equipment.
Maya:
Wow, Nick! You know a lot about the industry!
Phoenix:
Umm, what else would they keep in a film studio?




Vending machine







Phoenix:
Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks or something. Popcorn, at least!
Maya:
W-wait! Look! "Samurai Soda"! Nick! Try this!
Phoenix:

(Powers's dressing room... So this is where he was sleeping? Or at least, this is where he claims he was sleeping.)Maya:
No one actually saw him taking a nap here, did they?Phoenix:
Right, and there's a picture of him near the crime scene. (I hope he's telling the truth... for his sake!)Examine









Cosmetics







Phoenix:
There's a vast array of cosmetics here.
Maya:
Ooh! This is the wig he used in "Samurai Boogey-Woogey"! Nick! Try this on!
Phoenix:
No. And how can you tell the name of a show just by looking at a wig!?
Maya:
I, um, kinda like samurai movies.
Phoenix:
("Kinda"...?)




Costume rack







Phoenix:
There's some regular suits in among the costumes here. Those must be his own clothes.
Maya:
It'd be fun to wear one of the costumes...
Phoenix:
(I'd say you were already wearing one, myself.)




Couch







Phoenix:
Looks like someone was sleeping here. Maybe Powers did take a nap here yesterday...




Mirror







Phoenix:
They always have mirrors like this in dressing rooms. I see my hair is still nice and spiky, just how I like it.




Bag







Maya:
Hmm? This must be Powers's bag.
Phoenix:
Hey, don't open that.
Maya:
Look!
Phoenix:
An employee cardkey. That must be Powers's. It says "Studio One."
Maya:
Let's take it, Nick!
Phoenix:
Borrow it. You mean borrow.
Cardkey added to the Court Record.




Bag (subsequent times)







Maya:
I wonder what else is inside Powers's bag...?
Phoenix:
Stop that! (My partner, the thief in training.)




Table







Phoenix:
There's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Some tea and cookies...
Maya:
Nick... I'm hungry!
Phoenix:
You just had a burger!
Maya:
Yeah, but I have a separate stomach for sweets!
Phoenix:
(How many stomachs does this girl have!?)

Phoenix:
It's locked. Looks like he doesn't open his window much. I guess it is kind of dusty outside.Wright & Co. Law OfficesPresent

Could you tell me about this, ma'am?
Oldbag:
Oh that! Isn't that a studio cardkey? You better watch it! The scene of a murder is no place for sightseeing! I'll be taking that! Hand it over!
Phoenix:
W-wait! No, that's mine!

Studio One entrance







Phoenix:
The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.

Director's chair







Maya:
Hey! Look! That's the chair the director sits in! I've always wanted to sit in one of these. Hey Nick, take a look at that. One of those black-and-white boards they clap at the start of filming! And look! A megaphone! A real live megaphone!
Phoenix:

Ready, Nick? Action!

Film camera







Leads to:
"Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!"




Reflecting screen







Maya:
What's this?
Phoenix:
That's for reflecting light. They call it a reflecting screen or something like that. The assistant holds it during filming.
Maya:
Huh.
Phoenix:
What? Where's your enthusiasm for all things entertainment?
Maya:
Well, lighting is fine, but I'd want to be the director. Or maybe the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
(I think she's being serious...!)




Stage backdrop







Phoenix:
Looks like a backdrop for a stage. This must be used in the Steel Samurai show.
Maya:
Of course! That's the mountain, Neo Fujiyama!
Phoenix:
Doesn't the Steel Samurai take place in Olde Tokyo? Can you even see Mt. Fuji from there?
Maya:
Not Olde Tokyo, Nick! "Neo" Olde Tokyo!
Phoenix:
Oh. Right.

Maya:
Look, a ladder!
Phoenix:
That's a "step"-ladder.
Maya:
So? What's the difference? You need to stop judging things based on narrow-minded cultural assumptions, Nick!
Phoenix:
R-right... sorry. (This girl is OUT there!)




Tape outline







Phoenix:
They outlined where Jack Hammer's body lay with tape. His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. I guess that's why the head part looks like a helmet. Funny, I expected a spear stabbing would leave at least a few bloodstains. I guess the costume must have absorbed most of it...Maya:
Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!Phoenix:
Yeah! So don't touch it!Maya:
Whoa! It's heavier than I thought...???:
Hey! You! No touching that!Phoenix:
Ah, um, sorry, my partner is kind of, y'know...Maya:

I don't envy you guys one bit! But... do what you can for WP, okay? He'd never hurt a fly! He has to be innocent.Maya:
Don't worry, leave it to us!Talk









The day of the crime







Phoenix:
Could you tell me anything about the day of the murder?
Penny:
Yes. I was in the studio the whole day. I was the only assistant on staff that day, you see.
Maya:
Only one assistant!?
Penny:
Yes, well, the studios isn't doing so well right now. (Changed from [Yes, well, the studios aren't doing so well right now.] in the original release) And yesterday was only rehearsal for our action sequences.
Maya:
Oh, I see. (Changed from [I see. Neat!] in the original release)
Penny:
In the morning we went through the action sequences in the employee area. WP and Hammer were there, along with everyone else.
Phoenix:
The employee area--that's where Powers's dressing room is, right?
Penny:
Yes, that's the place. After eating lunch there, Mr. Hammer went to Studio One. Then I saw WP go into his dressing room. But I didn't see either of them after that.




Will Powers







Phoenix:
Did you know that Mr. Powers was sleeping in his room?
Penny:
No! I wouldn't go in there unless I had some urgent message for him... I mean, it's his private... What kind of a girl do you think I am!?
Phoenix:
W-what kind...? No, no, I'm sure you're a fine girl. Um, sorry. (So much for getting a confirmation of Powers's alibi.)Present

Um, any thoughts about this?
Penny:
Sorry... I... don't really want to think too much about what happened just yet.After clearing all Talk options:Maya:
What do we do, Nick? We haven't found anything. If WP was the only one who came to the studio... Then he has to be the killer! They even have a photograph...Phoenix:

Not really.Penny:
Actually, there's been something bothering me.Maya:
Ah hah! That's what I'm talking about! A clue! A lead!Penny:
Well, I don't know about that, but that day, just after noon, I sensed someone was here...Phoenix:
You "sensed"?Penny:
Yes, several times.Phoenix:
Some other studio employees, maybe?Penny:
No, I don't think so. The only thing we had scheduled was an action scene run-through. I was the only assistant here that day. I have a feeling it was someone from... outside.Phoenix:
R-really!?Maya:
But wait, if someone had come in here... Wouldn't that security lady have noticed them?Phoenix:
Yeah, you're right.Penny:
I'm sorry I don't have any better information than that.Maya:
No, thanks! That helps us a lot. Anything helps. Let's go put that security lady on the spot!Talk

Phoenix:
So you sensed that someone other than the regular film crew was in the studio?
Penny:
Yes... I think.

What? I saw that suspicious look on your face!Phoenix:
I wanted to ask you again about yesterday... You came here at 1:00 PM, correct? And the estimated time of Hammer's death was 2:30. Are you sure that Powers was the only one to go through here between those times?Oldbag:
Sure as can be!Maya:
But we have a witness who thinks there was "someone from outside" here that day.Oldbag:
What!?Maya:
Are you absolutely sure you were here watching the whole time?Oldbag:

Alright you better tell me and tell me quick, you spiky-haired cretin! Someone's been complaining about the work I do, eh!?Maya:
Uh... um, we were just talking to the assistant in Studio One.Oldbag:
Her! She's not even a full-time employee! All you young'uns are like that nowadays, running your mouths like there was no tomorrow saying this that and the other thing. Well when I was young let me tell you we knew a thing or two about respecting our elders. Back then we did and it's a crying shame that you youths today just say what you please about poor old ladies Graaaaaaaaaaaawr!Phoenix:

Yeah, maybe. (Should I try the computer?)

Phoenix:
Okay. Let's give it a try.
Maya:
You know how to work these things, Nick?
Phoenix:
Looks like I just have to enter in a few numbers. Let's see... first, I need the date of the murder. (It looks like the camera turned on at 1:00 PM that day... 1:00... That was when the security lady arrived at the guard station.)

Part 6October 18, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:
Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth:
The prosecution will show the court that at 2:30 PM on October 15, the defendant, Mr. Will Powers, killed fellow actor Jack Hammer at Studio One of Global Studios. It is impossible for anyone else to have committed this heinous crime. The evidence presented during the trial will all point to this fact.Judge:
Hmm. I see. Very well, I would like to move on to your testimony. Mr. Edgeworth, the prosecution may call its first witness.Edgeworth:
Very well, I call a most familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand. (Changed from [First, I would like to call a familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand.] in the original release)Edgeworth:
Detective, if you would briefly describe this case to the court?Gumshoe:
Yes sir! I'll explain with the guidemap here. To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see? This here is the Employee Area. The actors did a run-through of their action scenes during the morning here. This is the main gate to the studios. The security lady that works at the studios was here at 1:00 PM on that day. Past the security station there is a gate, see? Past that are the studios. And here it is... Studio One. This is the scene of the murder, where the body was found! Now, on the day of the murder, October 15, there were only three people here. The victim, Jack Hammer, the defendant, Will Powers, and a young woman, the production assistant. All the production staff were in the Employee Area until noon. Then after lunch, the victim, Jack Hammer, went to Studio One. Right after that, at 1:00 PM, the security lady got to the guard station. Now, jump ahead to later that day... 5:00 PM. The production staff came to Studio One to perform a rehearsal. Needless to say, the rehearsal was cancelled... The time of death was 2:30 PM. The "Samurai Spear" found lodged in the victim's chest was the murder weapon. That's the case, in brief. Anyone like to hear that again?Phoenix:
(Hmm... should I listen to that whole thing again...?)Skip it







Leads to:
"I think I can probably remember that..."Listen again







Phoenix:
I'm sorry, could you describe that one more time?
Gumshoe:
I shoulda known it would be you, pal! Fine. Once more for the mentally-challenged lawyer.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, yeah. Live it up while you can, Gumshoe.)
Leads back to:
"To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see?"Phoenix:
(I think I can probably remember that...)Judge:
So the murder weapon was a "spear"? How... medieval!Samurai Spear added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:
Your Honor. This case is quite simple if you ask one question: And that question is: "What did the security lady at the guard station see?"Judge:
Understood.Edgeworth:
Let's call this security officer to the stand!Edgeworth:
Will the witness declare her name?Oldbag:
... Hmm? My, aren't you a handsome fellow! I'm afraid I'm a bit flustered!Edgeworth:
Y-your name, please!Oldbag:
Oh, dearie! No need for you to be embarrassed! Just call me "grandma."Edgeworth:
YOUR NAME, PLEASE!Phoenix:
(Seems Edgeworth has a bit of trouble getting his witnesses to say their names...)Oldbag:
Wendy Oldbag, dearie. So just call me "grandma." It's practically my name! So even when I was young I was an Oldbag, but not really that was just my name dearie. Still how the other children would make fun of me and just because of my name can you believe it? But there was this boy, the captain of the chess club in junior high, and when he called me an old bag well I just cried and cried because I had a crush on him you see--Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
O-objection! I... object to the witness's talkativeness.Judge:
Objection sustained! The witness will refrain from rambling on the stand.Oldbag:
I was just getting to the good part, dearie!Edgeworth:
Perhaps we can get to the testimony?Judge:
Now, the witness was stationed at the main gate on the day of the murder, correct?Oldbag:
Yessey I was.Judge:
And to get to the scene of the murder, someone would have to pass by you?Oldbag:
You know your stuff, dearie!Judge:
... You may begin your testimony.Phoenix:
(She sure is one hell of an Oldbag...)Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Oldbag:
On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.
Poor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.
I, well, I had some errands to run that morning.
Anyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.
I was at the main gate from then until 5:00!
Now, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?
Interesting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.
It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!Judge:
You saw the defendant, then? Hmm... Very well. Let's begin the cross-examination. Mr. Wright?Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So up until that time, anyone who wanted to could go into the studio?
Oldbag:
Well, there wasn't a security guard at the gate, no. But the main gate was locked, dearie. You'd need an employee cardkey to get in.
Phoenix:
(Right... the cardkey that I have. So, what she's saying is no one who wasn't supposed to be there could get in.)

Was there anyone at the studios when you arrived at the guard station?Oldbag:
Poor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
A "run-through"...?
Oldbag:
They were working out a scene between the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate. They got the basics figured out by noon, and were to use the afternoon for practice. Rehearsal was supposed to start at 5:00. That's why poor old Hammer went to Studio One in the afternoon.
Phoenix:
(So Powers was in his dressing room sleeping... when he was supposed to be practicing! Talk about a laid-back hero...)
Edgeworth:
If there was a run-through in the morning, why did you only get there after noon?Oldbag:
I, well, I had some errands to run that morning.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What kind of "errands"?
Oldbag:
Oh, well, you know.
Phoenix:
Answer the question!
Oldbag:
Actually... I was watching poor Hammer and Powers. Observing, you know?
Phoenix:
O-observing? Weren't you supposed to be at the guard station?
Oldbag:
Whippersnapper! I told you I locked the gate, didn't I? I did my job!
Phoenix:
(I'm not sure your boss would see it that way...)
Oldbag:
Anyway! I always watch Hammer's run-throughts. Always! Never missed one in all my years.

Wow! I want to see a Steel Samurai run-through too!

No, it's just, after seeing you eating those donuts in the guard station yesterday...

Phoenix:

J-just a moment, Mr. Wright. Let me see that photo! ... What is this, exactly?Phoenix:
None other than the Steel Samurai, defender of Neo Olde Tokyo. Ms. Oldbag! Is this the "Mr. Powers" that you saw!?Oldbag:
Of course! Didn't your momma teach you any sense, sonny? Anyone can plainly see that's Powers! Right?Edgeworth:
No, they can't! (Changed from [Um, yeah.] in the original release) ... Umm... well. I mean, I wonder? (Changed from [Umm... well. I wonder?] in the original release)Phoenix:

You... helped make it better?

I kissed it where it hurt.

Phoenix:
Hold it right there! We keep talking possibilities, but we have to agree that this photo shows the Steel Samurai! Nowhere in this photo can we see Mr. Will Powers!
Judge:
Hmm... The defense has a point. I also wonder if someone else not caught on camera could have killed Mr. Hammer. We have to consider that possibility, also.

Then allow me to remove that doubt from your mind, Your Honor...

"Will the witness continue her testimony, please?"Wait and see what happens







Phoenix:
(I think I'll wait and see where this goes.)
Judge:
I suppose, since there weren't any additional crew members at the studios that day... It's quite likely that it was the defendant inside that costume. I see no problem with this evidence.

Most perceptive, Your Honor!

2024-11-29 17:19:21 [INFO] Assistant reply: Let's go through the testimony and compare it with the evidence available to identify any contradictions. We need to focus on Oldbag's testimony about who she saw going to the studio and when, and cross-reference that with the evidence we have:

### Witness Testimony:
1. The time of poor Hammer's death was 2:30 PM, true?
2. The only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers!
3. No one else went there!
4. If they had, I would have seen them!

### Available Evidence:
- **Guidemap**: Shows the layout of Global Studios.
- **Jack's Autopsy Report**: Indicates the time of death as 10/15 at 2:30 PM.
- **Powers's(?) Photo**: Taken at the gate between the entrance and the Studios. Shows Steel Samurai walking at 2:00 PM. 
- **Samurai Spear**: The murder weapon. The shaft was mended with duct tape.
- **Mr. Monkey's Head**: Blocked the path to the scene of the crime between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM.

### Key Points:
- The photo time stamp shows 2:00 PM, indicating the Steel Samurai was seen entering prior to the time of death, not directly at the time of death.
- **Mr. Monkey's Head** shows that the path was blocked from 2:15 PM to 4:00 PM, implying that Hammer's time of death at 2:30 PM contradicts the testimony that Powers was the only one who could have been there, as the path was blocked during the crime time.

Based on this analysis, Oldbag's testimony that "no one else went there" and "the only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers" seems overconfident without considering the possibility that the blocked path may have influenced access routes. The evidence from **Mr. Monkey's Head** could suggest a discrepancy in her statement about the accessibility of the crime scene.

### Conclusion:
The contradiction lies in testimony 2, "The only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers," as the path was blocked around the time of the crime. Let's present **Mr. Monkey's Head** to counter this statement.

### Final Answer:

2024-11-29 17:19:28 [INFO] Assistant reply: I apologize for the oversight. Let’s carefully reconsider the testimony and evidence to identify the contradiction.

### Witness Testimony:
0. The time of poor Hammer's death was 2:30 PM, true?
1. The only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers!
2. No one else went there!
3. If they had, I would have seen them!

### Available Evidence:
- **Jack's Autopsy Report**: Time of death: 10/15 at 2:30 PM.
- **Powers's(?) Photo**: Shows the Steel Samurai walking at 2:00 PM.
- **Mr. Monkey's Head**: Blocked the path to the scene of the crime between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM.

#### Key Considerations:
- **Powers's(?) Photo** places someone in the Steel Samurai costume at 2:00 PM.
- **Jack's Autopsy Report** establishes the time of death at 2:30 PM.
- **Mr. Monkey's Head** provides context about the path being blocked from 2:15 PM, which challenges whether there was any further access to the studio after this time.

### Contradiction:
The contradiction arises from the statement that Will Powers was the only person Oldbag saw going to the studio (testimony 1) when the **Powers's(?) Photo** simply shows someone in the costume, not verifying Will Powers' identity. It's better linked to the statement that Powers was the only person seen (testimony 1), backed by the ambiguity of the photo evidence.

### Correct Evidence:
- **Powers's(?) Photo** contradicts the certainty of her seeing "Will Powers" specifically, as anyone could've been in the costume.

Let's use this information to contradict testimony 1:

One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one.

Now for the morning news. The actor Will Powers was arrested yesterday. Powers plays the lead role in the popular kid's show "The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo." He was arrested on suspicion of murder. The victim was Jack Hammer, who plays the villain known as the "Evil Magistrate." His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. The "Samurai Spear" was also found stuck through the body. Police believe this was the murder weapon, and are investigating further.Phoenix:

Bookshelf







Phoenix:
There's a horrendous amount of legal books here. Scarier still is the thought that I have to read all of these now.




Houseplant







Phoenix:
Mia's favorite potted plant. Maya has been watering it so much lately it looks a little... swollen. She's either trying to make it grow... or she's perfecting her water torture technique.




Movie poster







Phoenix:
A poster of an old movie that Mia liked. I was thinking I should go see it myself. Then I realized that the poster doesn't actually say the title of the movie.




Desk







Phoenix:
Mia's desk. Actually... it's my desk now. Sitting here always makes me feel like a professional.




Window







Phoenix:
It's a nice day outside. The hotel across the way is always full these days. There's the bellboy, happily cleaning the room.Talk









What to do







Phoenix:
Well, what should we do?
Maya:
What should we do!? How can you just sit there like that!? We have to get down to the detention center and meet the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
(Does she want to investigate this case or just do some sightseeing, I wonder? My money's on sightseeing.)




Any ideas







Maya:
We don't have enough information to make a case yet.

Just admit it: you don't have a clue what happened.
Maya:
No! We just don't have enough information!Present

Security camera







Phoenix:
Smile for the camera...




Security guard







Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He seems frozen in awe of Will Powers.Talk









What happened







Phoenix:
Maybe you could start by telling us what happened.
Will:
Y-yes. Of course. It seems like it was only yesterday. Actually, it was only yesterday. The cast had come down to Global Studios for a run-through. We went through a few action sequences at 10:00 that morning. There was a rehearsal scheduled for 5:00 in the afternoon. But when 5:00 came around, and the staff gathered at the studio... The Evil Magistrate was found lying in a crumpled heap near the set. They took off his mask... And discovered that it was Jack Hammer... dead! He had been expertly skewered with the Samurai Spear.
Phoenix:
The "Samurai Spear"...?
Will:
Yes, it's a long spear that I... that the Steel Samurai uses as a weapon.




The Steel Samurai







Phoenix:
Maybe you could explain to me just what "the Steel Samurai" is.
Maya:
Nick! How could you say such a thing? I-I'm sorry, sir, I apologize for my partner! He's new to this, and a bit OUT OF TOUCH with the world.
Phoenix:
Hey! Who's "new to this"!?
Will:
No, it's alright, really. The Steel Samurai is the lead character in a popular kid's show. He walks the streets of Neo Olde Tokyo... Fighting battle after battle against the Evil Magistrate and his minions. Of course, he never really defeats the Evil Magistrate. Although... I guess he did defeat him this time... *sniff* Uwaaah!
Phoenix:
I-I see. (Neo Olde Tokyo...? Who comes up with these names!?)




Powers's alibi (appears after "What happened")







Phoenix:
Now, where were you on the day of the murder?
Will:
Well, that morning I came to studios at 9:00. We worked through some action scenes until noon. Rehearsal was to begin at 5:00, but I was a little tired. So after lunch, I took a nap in my dressing room. When I woke up, it was after 5:00! I was late for the rehearsal! I hurried to the studio... and found everyone looking shocked. They arrested me on the spot, and brought me here.
Phoenix:
(So he was sleeping the entire afternoon of the murder? Some action hero!)
Will:
What will the kids think? *sniff*Present

G-gawkers?Oldbag:
Gawkers! Sightseers! Tourists!!! I know the type. You heard about the incident and came to snoop around. Youths today! Something horrible happens and all you can think of is sightseeing. Wasting your time at a place like this. Don't you have jobs you should be doing? Or do lawyers not work like the rest of us? Maybe I should become a lawyer too. Sounds like a life of ease to me no work just loafing around all day as you please. Well when I was young things were a mite different, mind you we didn't prance around in strange hippie clothes. What are the youths coming to these days my own son hasn't called in...Maya:

Computer







Phoenix:
The computer that runs the studio security cameras.
Oldbag:
Hey! No touching!




Guard station







Phoenix:
The security guard station. That security lady must like junk food. There's a mountain of it on the desk in there. I can see the computer that runs the security cameras.




Main gate







Phoenix:
The main entrance to the studio. There was a big scene here yesterday with onlookers pressing up against the gate.




Studio map







Phoenix:
An overhead map of the studios. Right from here is the Employee Area. To the left are the actual film studios.




Studio van







Phoenix:
Looks like a studio van. They probably use it to carry around film equipment.Talk









The studios







Phoenix:
So, what do you do here at the studios?
Oldbag:
At Global Studios, we make children's dreams come true! In fact, in my younger days...
Maya:
No! You were a star!?
Oldbag:
Only a little twinkle between the stars here, I'm afraid, dearie.
Maya:
Wo... wow.
Oldbag:
This place has really gone downhill, you know? But 10 years ago, now that was a studio of dreams! Hammer was a big star back then too, he was...
Phoenix:
Hammer...?
Oldbag:
The victim, dummy! The Evil Magistrate! He's been reduced to playing villains now. Not exactly the best material to work with...




Will Powers







Phoenix:
Can you tell me about Mr. Will Powers?
Oldbag:
He's not a bad kid, but don't be fooled by his mask! You wouldn't want him on the silver screen without it, believe me. Little old ladies watching would lose their lunch! That's probably why he thought that the Steel Samurai was his "big chance." No one thought he was capable of doing what he did to poor Jack Hammer...
Maya:
We don't know for certain that Will Powers is guilty!
Oldbag:
Powers? Of course he's guilty! How do I know? I know everything! That's my job.




Mr. Hammer (appears after "The studios")







Phoenix:
What kind of person was Jack Hammer?
Oldbag:
What "kind of person"? Oh... if you only knew! Jack Hammer will live on in many hearts as the ultimate action hero! He was simply dashing in the Dynamite Samurai series!
Phoenix:
(Should I have heard of that...?)
Oldbag:
But... there was an accident during filming five years ago. He got an unlucky break after that. Reduced to playing the villain on a children's program! What's more, I heard they were paying him peanuts. It's enough to make you cry.




Reason for suspicion (appears after "Will Powers")







Phoenix:
Why are you so certain Mr. Powers is the killer?
Oldbag:
I was standing right here yesterday, I was. I was here from 1:00 in the afternoon, to 5:00, when they found the body! Now the studio where the murder took place is to the left here. So if you want to go to the studio, you have to pass by me! Only one person went by here between 1:00 and 2:30, when the murder took place!
Phoenix:
And... that person was Mr. Powers?
Oldbag:
Yes. I saw him!
Phoenix:
But Mr. Powers says he was sleeping in his dressing room.
Oldbag:
Oh, I'm sure he would say that. He's no fool! But he was the only one that walked by. He's the killer, you can bet your biscuits on it.Present

Hello! How was the studio? They all think I did it, don't they?Maya:
N-no, not at all! Isn't that right, Nick?Phoenix:
Right, not at all. At worst, you're a suspect.Will:
*sniff*Talk









Your alibi







Phoenix:
Mr. Powers, you aren't hiding anything from me, are you?
Will:
W-what? No! I'd never do that!
Phoenix:
Just now you said that you were sleeping in your dressing room after lunch.
Will:
Yes. Like a baby.
Phoenix:
But the security lady said she saw you that day. She says she saw you heading towards the scene of the crime!
Will:
W-what!? That's not possible! I... I really don't know what to say! I was sleeping, I promise!
Phoenix:
Mr. Powers, if you want me to help you, you have to tell me the truth. I'm new to this lawyer business, and I need every advantage I can get.
Will:
I know... I-I'm sorry. *sniff* But, I swear to you on my momma's grave, I was sleeping. Maybe the security lady only thought she saw me?
Phoenix:
(What did she see...? He doesn't seem to be lying.)




The security lady







Phoenix:
Umm... about the security guard at the main gate to the studio...
Will:
Oh, the security lady?
Maya:
She's terrible! She called me "suspicious lookin'"!
Will:
Y-yes... actually, she's said the same thing to me before. "Take off that mask!" were her words, I believe. She sucks up to all the bigwigs at the studio... But let her see you stumble once and she'll never let up on you.
Maya:
Grr! She's got some nerve!
Phoenix:
Do you think you could write up a letter formally requesting my representation?
Will:
Of c-course.
Powers's Request added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(I just hope this will get me past that security lady.)




The security lady (subsequent times)







Phoenix:
Umm... about the security guard at the main gate to the studio...
Will:
Oh, the security lady?
Maya:
She's terrible! She called me "suspicious lookin'"!
Will:
Y-yes... actually, she's said the same thing to me before. "Take off that mask!" were her words, I believe. She sucks up to all the bigwigs at the studio... But let her see you stumble once and she'll never let up on you.
Maya:
Grr! She's got some nerve!Present

Phoenix:
Thank you for the letter of request.

Powers's Letter







Phoenix:
Hey, look what I have!
Maya:
Hey! The Steel Samurai said we'd need that to get into the studio.
Phoenix:
You mean Will Powers said we'd need it...?

Yes, the Steel Samurai.

Powers's Letter







Leads to:
"Ma'am, have a look at this."Phoenix:
Ma'am, have a look at this. It's a letter of request from Mr. Powers.Oldbag:
Hmm...? Yes, yes. I recognize the bold, childish scrawl.Gave Powers's Request to the security lady.Oldbag:
To think he would entrust his fate to youths of such unreliable appearance... Really!Phoenix:
Really?Oldbag:
Anyway, you may pass. But only left from here, toward the studios! No going to the right. That's the Employee Area. "No one allowed inside, pal" were my instructions. The good detective told me himself.Maya:
Hey, hey, Nick.Phoenix:
Huh?Maya:
There were maps in the security guard station.Phoenix:
Hey! Not bad!Oldbag:
Those are 50 cents a piece,
thank you!Maya:
Well, time to go, Nick.Oldbag:
50 cents!Guidemap of Global Studios added to the Court Record.October 16Studio One EntranceGumshoe:
Hey! Aren't you that murderer from the other day!Maya:
Aah! It's that confused detective!Gumshoe:
Hey pal, you know Prosecutor Edgeworth is all upset, and it's your fault! I saw him sipping tea and staring gloomily out the window!Phoenix:
Umm... so?Maya:
Hey! If he's depressed, it's all your fault for doing sloppy detective work!Gumshoe:
!!! ... ... ...Maya:
Um, Detective?Phoenix:
I think you hurt his feelings.Maya:
Oh no! I... I'm sorry!Phoenix:
Well, I think his feelings are easily hurt.Gumshoe:
You're right, pal. It's all my fault. I can blame other people all I want, but I know the truth in my heart!Maya:
Hey, hey! Don't take it so hard! There's always the next case!Gumshoe:
Yeah, I suppose you're right. Hey! What exactly are you two doing here?Maya:
Um, well... We're on this case too, pal!Gumshoe:
Huh!? Hey! You can't just go saying "pal" like that! That's MY endearing character trait!Maya:
I'd say he's a character alright...Examine









Bench







Phoenix:
I'm a little bushed. Maybe I'll take a short rest here.
Gumshoe:
Hey, good idea, pal!
Maya:
Detective! Aren't you on the case?
Gumshoe:
W-well, yeah, but... Hey, us detectives get tired of standing around too, pal!




Left path







Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe, what's down the path to the left? It looks like a tree fell down over the path...?
Gumshoe:
Oh, yeah. That way's kind of dangerous. You should stay out, pal. There's nothing down there, anyway. That's where Studio Two used to be, they tell me. They don't use it now, though.




Statue with broken head







Phoenix:
The studio mascot. I guess it's a monkey of some kind. But what kind of monkey has a nose like that? He's holding a sign in his hand. [Right: To Studio One; Left: To Studio Two]
Maya:
What's up with that thing!? It looks kind of... busted.
Gumshoe:
Oh, the wind was pretty strong yesterday, and the head broke off. It took that tree down with it, too.




Security camera







Phoenix:
Hey, there's a camera here.
Gumshoe:
That's the security camera. It takes photos of people going to the studio. All you have to do is look at the data and you can see who went where!
Phoenix:
There's a number plate on the camera... [ST1-307]. That must be the camera ID number.




Studio One entrance







Phoenix:
The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.
Maya:
Let's go in and check it out, Nick! ... Hey! It's locked!
Phoenix:
Looks like you need a cardkey to get in. It makes sense that they would want to keep the non-employees out.




Welcome sign







Maya:
There's a big welcome sign above the path.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, apparently the studio's fallen on tough times. They've started letting people in on days they aren't filming. They make a bit of extra money by charging for admission.
Maya:
Huh. You sure know a lot about this place, Detective. You know, you could always quit being a detective and work here?
Phoenix:
Yeah! And what perfect timing, with the monkey's neck broken and all.
Gumshoe:
Huh? Just what's that supposed to mean, pal!?Talk









The investigation







Phoenix:
So, how is your investigation going, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Well, it's... Hey! I can't tell you that, pal.
Maya:
Nick... Maybe you need to be a little more indirect with your questions?
Phoenix:
Right. So, Detective, mind if I take a look at what you got?
Gumshoe:
What I got?
Phoenix:
The autopsy report! The latest version, if you please...
Gumshoe:
Hmm... right, right. Sorry about what happened last time, pal.
Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.




The investigation (subsequent times)







Phoenix:
So, how is your investigation going, Detective?
Gumshoe:
I'm not at liberty to give you any more information, pal. You'll hear all you need to know in court!
Phoenix:
(Oh well, it was worth a try.)




Reason for arrest







Phoenix:
Why was Mr. Powers arrested?
Gumshoe:
Simple, pal! The murder took place right over there in Studio One. Now, the victim entered Studio One at approximately 1:00 PM. At that time, there was no one other than the victim in the studio. According to the autopsy report, the time of death was 2:30 PM. Only one person went to the studio between 1:00 and 2:30! And that person was none other than Will Powers! No one else, pal! If you think I'm lying, ask the security lady at the main gate.
Maya:
Nick! If that's true...! Anyone would think that Powers did it with that kind of evidence!
Phoenix:
Thanks for cheering me up...




The security lady







Phoenix:
About the security lady...
Gumshoe:
Oh, that sweet old lady. What a charmer!
Phoenix:
Huh? A-are we talking about the same person?
Gumshoe:
When I showed her my badge she gave me a donut and some coffee!
Maya:
Remember what Powers said. She's a sucker for authority.
Gumshoe:
She even gave me a piece of valuable evidence!
Maya:
Whaat!?




Decisive evidence (appears after "The security lady")







Phoenix:
What kind of evidence!?
Gumshoe:
Well, that, er, photo. The photo of the Steel Samurai heading toward the scene of the crime!
Maya:
What! Who took that!?
Gumshoe:
See the camera up on that gate, pal?
Maya:
The gate? You mean the one with the welcome sign?
Gumshoe:
Yeah. Whenever someone walks by, that camera automatically snaps a photo of them!
Maya:
Oh no! Nick, he has evidence! We're finished!
Phoenix:
(Funny, for someone with hard proof he doesn't look too happy.)
Gumshoe:
...Present









Attorney's Badge







Phoenix:
Detective, see this? This is my attorney's badge.
Gumshoe:
Uh huh? Don'tcha think it's a little sad when you have to explain what your badge means, pal? Real men show their P.D. badge and that's that!
Phoenix:
I'll admit the design of my badge leaves a lot to be desired...
Maya:
Maybe it should just be a big "L" for "Lawyer"?
Phoenix:
Hmm... I'm not so sure about that.




Anything else







Phoenix:
Um, Detective. Any ideas about this?
Gumshoe:
Look, I don't got time to look at every little trinket you got, okay pal?After clearing "The investigation" and "Decisive evidence" Talk options:Gumshoe:
What's wrong, pal? You seem down.Phoenix:
Don't look so happy when you say that.Gumshoe:
Oh hoh hoh hoh hoh!Maya:
Umm... We'd like to ask the employees here some questions...Gumshoe:
Sure thing, pal. Go wherever you like. Of course, you're not going to find any clues I haven't already found! Hah hah hah!Phoenix:
(I'm glad someone around here seems to be enjoying themselves.)Maya:
Nick, let's go! We've got a free pass to the place. Now's our chance to check things out!Studio - Main GateMaya:
Nick! Look! That security lady is in the guard station stuffing her face with donuts! I guess all cops like their donuts!Phoenix:
Yeah, and they're soft enough she doesn't need teeth to chew them...Oldbag:
Hey, you! Well? Are you satisfied Powers is guilty yet?Phoenix:
(Urk! She had to make my life harder by giving that photo to Detective Gumshoe...)Talk









Photographic proof







Phoenix:
Why didn't you tell us about the security photo, ma'am?
Oldbag:
Hmm? Oh, that? I just thought it would be more thrilling to talk with the detective himself! These things are important, you know. Oh, just to the left from here is the gate with the camera that took that photo. It's my job to check the photos every day, you see.




Reason for suspicion







Oldbag:
This guard station is in a central position. No matter where you go here, you pass by my station first! Now poor Hammer, he went to the studio just before 1:00. The murder happened right around 2:30, see? The only one I seen go through here between 1:00 and 2:30 was Powers himself! The security camera got a good look at him too. If he's not the one what did it, I don't know who is!
Phoenix:
Maybe... it was you?
Oldbag:
Gyah hah ha hah! Good one, sonny.
Phoenix:
(She thinks I was joking.)




Mr. Hammer







Phoenix:
Was the victim, Mr. Hammer, a popular actor?
Oldbag:
Oh, he was the biggest star in the studio!
Phoenix:
("Was"? Past tense?)
Maya:
Oh yes! He was great as the "Bearded Samurai"!
Oldbag:
That too, yes. He shone the brightest! Back in the day. Making a star like him play the "Evil Magistrate"... It's a disgrace, I tell you! Hammer took it pretty hard, and who can blame him?




Automatic camera (appears after "Photographic proof")







Phoenix:
About the security camera...
Oldbag:
Oh yes, the camera. It's automatic. It can tell when someone walks through that gate, see? Then it snaps a photo! Apparently, it records the time when it takes a picture too. But I don't bother myself with those details. I just view all the photos on the computer over in the security guard station. I check 'em every day before going home, I do.October 16Wright & Co. Law OfficesMaya:
What's going on, Nick!? Powers said he was sleeping in his dressing room! But now there's a photo of him going to the studio!?Phoenix:
Don't look at me! How should I know?Talk









What to do







Phoenix:
What do you think?
Maya:
That photo the detective was talking about is the problem here.
Phoenix:
Well, that's hard to say, without seeing the actual photo ourselves. But if it is Powers in that photo, his alibi is shot.




Photographic proof







Phoenix:
Only one person went to the scene of the crime before the murder took place. And there's a photograph to prove it.
Maya:
I guess it makes sense that that person is the killer then. What do we do, Nick?
Phoenix:
Maybe there was someone else who could have gone to the scene other than Powers? Let's take a look. Maybe that security lady missed someone?
Maya:
On thing's for sure, if there are any clues, they'll be in that studio.October 16Detention CenterVisitor's RoomPhoenix:
...Maya:
Apparently they have Mr. Powers in questioning.Phoenix:
Hmm... right.Gumshoe:
Look pal, that camera takes a picture automatically whenever someone walks by. And it took a picture of Will Powers!Phoenix:
I have to ask him about that photograph!Maya:
Oh well. Let's try again later.Examine









Security guard







Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He must get pretty bored. I bet he's making funny faces at that camera.October 16Global StudiosEmployee AreaMaya:
Nick! This is where they do all the behind-the-scenes stuff! Hey! Look! There's Powers's dressing room! No one's here this soon after the murder I guess. Let's take a look around!Examine









Bicycle







Phoenix:
Looks like one of those electric-powered bicycles. I dunno about these. I mean, what's the point?
Maya:
It makes it a lot easier to go up hills!
Phoenix:
Don't people cycle to get exercise!?




Drain grate







Phoenix:
The metal grate on the drain here has been taken off. That's a pretty big drain. A kid could fit through there, I bet.
Maya:
Yeah, if you snuck in that way you wouldn't have to pay at the gate!
Phoenix:
Well, if you want to leave that way, be my guest.
Maya:
Right! Huh? Hey! I'm not a kid!




Grate







Phoenix:
The grate that used to cover the drain. It's a little bent. I don't think it would fit if I tried to put it back on.




Lunch table







Phoenix:
The remains of yesterday's lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak.
Maya:
Mmm! T-bone steak! That would have hit the spot.
Phoenix:
You just had a burger!
Maya:
Yeah, but I have a second stomach just for steaks.
Phoenix:
(What!?)




Stage backdrop







Phoenix:
There's a half-finished backdrop for a stage here. Looks like a castle. Probably "Neo Olde Tokyo Castle."




Dressing room door







Phoenix:
The door to the dressing room. It's not locked.
Maya:
Hey, Nick! Let's take a look inside! Maybe we can find something as a souvenir...?
Phoenix:
What do you mean "find"!?
Maya:
You never know! There might be something like... the Samurai Spear!
Phoenix:
We don't need a spear! (And that's the murder weapon for crying out loud!)




Dressing room sign







Phoenix:
There's a sign on the dressing room door. "Mr. Will Powers"... it must be neat to be the star and have your own room like this.




Dressing room window







Phoenix:
A window into the dressing room. The glass is frosted, so I can't see inside.




Storage room door







Phoenix:
That must be the storage room. That's where they keep all the film equipment.
Maya:
Wow, Nick! You know a lot about the industry!
Phoenix:
Umm, what else would they keep in a film studio?




Vending machine







Phoenix:
Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks or something. Popcorn, at least!
Maya:
W-wait! Look! "Samurai Soda"! Nick! Try this!

Right, and there's a picture of him near the crime scene. (I hope he's telling the truth... for his sake!)Examine









Cosmetics







Phoenix:
There's a vast array of cosmetics here.
Maya:
Ooh! This is the wig he used in "Samurai Boogey-Woogey"! Nick! Try this on!
Phoenix:
No. And how can you tell the name of a show just by looking at a wig!?
Maya:
I, um, kinda like samurai movies.
Phoenix:
("Kinda"...?)




Costume rack







Phoenix:
There's some regular suits in among the costumes here. Those must be his own clothes.
Maya:
It'd be fun to wear one of the costumes...
Phoenix:
(I'd say you were already wearing one, myself.)




Couch







Phoenix:
Looks like someone was sleeping here. Maybe Powers did take a nap here yesterday...




Mirror







Phoenix:
They always have mirrors like this in dressing rooms. I see my hair is still nice and spiky, just how I like it.




Bag







Maya:
Hmm? This must be Powers's bag.
Phoenix:
Hey, don't open that.
Maya:
Look!
Phoenix:
An employee cardkey. That must be Powers's. It says "Studio One."
Maya:
Let's take it, Nick!
Phoenix:
Borrow it. You mean borrow.
Cardkey added to the Court Record.




Bag (subsequent times)







Maya:
I wonder what else is inside Powers's bag...?
Phoenix:
Stop that! (My partner, the thief in training.)




Table







Phoenix:
There's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Some tea and cookies...
Maya:
Nick... I'm hungry!
Phoenix:
You just had a burger!
Maya:
Yeah, but I have a separate stomach for sweets!
Phoenix:

Director's chair







Maya:
Hey! Look! That's the chair the director sits in! I've always wanted to sit in one of these. Hey Nick, take a look at that. One of those black-and-white boards they clap at the start of filming! And look! A megaphone! A real live megaphone!

Reflecting screen







Maya:
What's this?
Phoenix:
That's for reflecting light. They call it a reflecting screen or something like that. The assistant holds it during filming.
Maya:
Huh.
Phoenix:
What? Where's your enthusiasm for all things entertainment?
Maya:
Well, lighting is fine, but I'd want to be the director. Or maybe the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:

Stage backdrop







Phoenix:
Looks like a backdrop for a stage. This must be used in the Steel Samurai show.
Maya:
Of course! That's the mountain, Neo Fujiyama!
Phoenix:
Doesn't the Steel Samurai take place in Olde Tokyo? Can you even see Mt. Fuji from there?
Maya:
Not Olde Tokyo, Nick! "Neo" Olde Tokyo!
Phoenix:
Oh. Right.

Look, a ladder!
Phoenix:
That's a "step"-ladder.
Maya:
So? What's the difference? You need to stop judging things based on narrow-minded cultural assumptions, Nick!
Phoenix:
R-right... sorry. (This girl is OUT there!)




Tape outline







Phoenix:
They outlined where Jack Hammer's body lay with tape. His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. I guess that's why the head part looks like a helmet. Funny, I expected a spear stabbing would leave at least a few bloodstains. I guess the costume must have absorbed most of it...Maya:
Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!Phoenix:
Yeah! So don't touch it!Maya:
Whoa! It's heavier than I thought...???:
Hey! You! No touching that!Phoenix:

The day of the crime







Phoenix:
Could you tell me anything about the day of the murder?
Penny:
Yes. I was in the studio the whole day. I was the only assistant on staff that day, you see.
Maya:
Only one assistant!?
Penny:
Yes, well, the studios isn't doing so well right now. (Changed from [Yes, well, the studios aren't doing so well right now.] in the original release) And yesterday was only rehearsal for our action sequences.
Maya:
Oh, I see. (Changed from [I see. Neat!] in the original release)
Penny:
In the morning we went through the action sequences in the employee area. WP and Hammer were there, along with everyone else.
Phoenix:
The employee area--that's where Powers's dressing room is, right?
Penny:
Yes, that's the place. After eating lunch there, Mr. Hammer went to Studio One. Then I saw WP go into his dressing room. But I didn't see either of them after that.




Will Powers

You "sensed"?Penny:
Yes, several times.Phoenix:
Some other studio employees, maybe?Penny:
No, I don't think so. The only thing we had scheduled was an action scene run-through. I was the only assistant here that day. I have a feeling it was someone from... outside.Phoenix:

Okay. Let's give it a try.

Part 6October 18, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:
Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth:
The prosecution will show the court that at 2:30 PM on October 15, the defendant, Mr. Will Powers, killed fellow actor Jack Hammer at Studio One of Global Studios. It is impossible for anyone else to have committed this heinous crime. The evidence presented during the trial will all point to this fact.Judge:
Hmm. I see. Very well, I would like to move on to your testimony. Mr. Edgeworth, the prosecution may call its first witness.Edgeworth:
Very well, I call a most familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand. (Changed from [First, I would like to call a familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand.] in the original release)Edgeworth:
Detective, if you would briefly describe this case to the court?Gumshoe:
Yes sir! I'll explain with the guidemap here. To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see? This here is the Employee Area. The actors did a run-through of their action scenes during the morning here. This is the main gate to the studios. The security lady that works at the studios was here at 1:00 PM on that day. Past the security station there is a gate, see? Past that are the studios. And here it is... Studio One. This is the scene of the murder, where the body was found! Now, on the day of the murder, October 15, there were only three people here. The victim, Jack Hammer, the defendant, Will Powers, and a young woman, the production assistant. All the production staff were in the Employee Area until noon. Then after lunch, the victim, Jack Hammer, went to Studio One. Right after that, at 1:00 PM, the security lady got to the guard station. Now, jump ahead to later that day... 5:00 PM. The production staff came to Studio One to perform a rehearsal. Needless to say, the rehearsal was cancelled... The time of death was 2:30 PM. The "Samurai Spear" found lodged in the victim's chest was the murder weapon. That's the case, in brief. Anyone like to hear that again?Phoenix:
(Hmm... should I listen to that whole thing again...?)Skip it







Leads to:
"I think I can probably remember that..."Listen again







Phoenix:
I'm sorry, could you describe that one more time?
Gumshoe:
I shoulda known it would be you, pal! Fine. Once more for the mentally-challenged lawyer.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, yeah. Live it up while you can, Gumshoe.)
Leads back to:
"To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see?"Phoenix:
(I think I can probably remember that...)Judge:
So the murder weapon was a "spear"? How... medieval!Samurai Spear added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:
Your Honor. This case is quite simple if you ask one question: And that question is: "What did the security lady at the guard station see?"Judge:
Understood.Edgeworth:
Let's call this security officer to the stand!Edgeworth:
Will the witness declare her name?Oldbag:
... Hmm? My, aren't you a handsome fellow! I'm afraid I'm a bit flustered!Edgeworth:
Y-your name, please!Oldbag:
Oh, dearie! No need for you to be embarrassed! Just call me "grandma."Edgeworth:
YOUR NAME, PLEASE!Phoenix:
(Seems Edgeworth has a bit of trouble getting his witnesses to say their names...)Oldbag:
Wendy Oldbag, dearie. So just call me "grandma." It's practically my name! So even when I was young I was an Oldbag, but not really that was just my name dearie. Still how the other children would make fun of me and just because of my name can you believe it? But there was this boy, the captain of the chess club in junior high, and when he called me an old bag well I just cried and cried because I had a crush on him you see--Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
O-objection! I... object to the witness's talkativeness.Judge:
Objection sustained! The witness will refrain from rambling on the stand.Oldbag:
I was just getting to the good part, dearie!Edgeworth:
Perhaps we can get to the testimony?Judge:
Now, the witness was stationed at the main gate on the day of the murder, correct?Oldbag:
Yessey I was.Judge:
And to get to the scene of the murder, someone would have to pass by you?Oldbag:
You know your stuff, dearie!Judge:
... You may begin your testimony.Phoenix:
(She sure is one hell of an Oldbag...)Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Oldbag:
On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.
Poor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.
I, well, I had some errands to run that morning.
Anyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.
I was at the main gate from then until 5:00!
Now, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?
Interesting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.
It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!Judge:
You saw the defendant, then? Hmm... Very well. Let's begin the cross-examination. Mr. Wright?Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.Cross Examination-- Witness's Account --Oldbag:
On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So up until that time, anyone who wanted to could go into the studio?
Oldbag:
Well, there wasn't a security guard at the gate, no. But the main gate was locked, dearie. You'd need an employee cardkey to get in.
Phoenix:
(Right... the cardkey that I have. So, what she's saying is no one who wasn't supposed to be there could get in.)
Edgeworth:
Was there anyone at the studios when you arrived at the guard station?Oldbag:
Poor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
A "run-through"...?
Oldbag:
They were working out a scene between the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate. They got the basics figured out by noon, and were to use the afternoon for practice. Rehearsal was supposed to start at 5:00. That's why poor old Hammer went to Studio One in the afternoon.
Phoenix:
(So Powers was in his dressing room sleeping... when he was supposed to be practicing! Talk about a laid-back hero...)
Edgeworth:
If there was a run-through in the morning, why did you only get there after noon?Oldbag:
I, well, I had some errands to run that morning.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What kind of "errands"?
Oldbag:
Oh, well, you know.
Phoenix:
Answer the question!
Oldbag:
Actually... I was watching poor Hammer and Powers. Observing, you know?
Phoenix:
O-observing? Weren't you supposed to be at the guard station?
Oldbag:
Whippersnapper! I told you I locked the gate, didn't I? I did my job!
Phoenix:
(I'm not sure your boss would see it that way...)
Oldbag:
Anyway! I always watch Hammer's run-throughts. Always! Never missed one in all my years.
Maya:
Wow! I want to see a Steel Samurai run-through too!
Phoenix:
You could quit being a spirit medium and take up guard duty.
Maya:
Not a bad idea...Oldbag:
Anyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Did you see the victim then?
Oldbag:
Did I see poor old Hammer? Nope. He'd already gone to the studio before I got back to the guard station.
Edgeworth:
Tell us what happened next.Oldbag:
I was at the main gate from then until 5:00!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So you were watching there the WHOLE time? No breaks? Not even a second?
Oldbag:
O-of course! I am a professional, you know! Our are you criticizing how I do my job!? Whippersnapper!
Phoenix:
No, it's just, after seeing you eating those donuts in the guard station yesterday...
Oldbag:
I can watch the gate and eat donuts at the same time! Snipperwhapper!
Maya:
"Snipperwhapper"...? Old windbag is losing it, Nick.
Phoenix:
Why don't you raise an objection?
Judge:
So, the witness was on duty through the afternoon, the whole time. Very well. What did you see?Oldbag:
Now, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
How did you know that?
Oldbag:
Oh hoh hoh. I have my ways! That over-dressed young detective told me. I fed him some donuts and he talked and talked... If you ask me, that detective isn't cut out for his job.
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
(Poor Detective Gumshoe, getting chewed out by a security guard...)Oldbag:
Interesting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
2:00? You're sure?
Oldbag:
Sure as spit!
Judge:
Well, who was the man!?
Oldbag:
Really, you should try not to get so excited at your age. You might strain something.
Judge:

Oldbag:
Now, now, don't get your skivvies all in a bunch. I'll tell you who it was!Present Powers's(?) Photo







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag!"Oldbag:
It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So you saw Mr. Powers?
Oldbag:
That's what I said! Got wax in your ears, sonny?
Maya:
Nick, this is your chance!
Phoenix:
Yeah, time to pull out the secret weapon...
Oldbag:
I'll say it again! It was him!Present Powers's(?) Photo







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag!"Maya:
Nick... Doesn't she seem like she's enjoying this a little too much?Phoenix:
Windbags love gossiping about other people's misfortunes.Maya:
Ugh. Can't she get her kicks somewhere else?Phoenix:
Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag! You've been saying since yesterday that you "saw Mr. Powers," correct? But you're talking about the man in this photo, aren't you!Judge:
J-just a moment, Mr. Wright. Let me see that photo! ... What is this, exactly?Phoenix:
None other than the Steel Samurai, defender of Neo Olde Tokyo. Ms. Oldbag! Is this the "Mr. Powers" that you saw!?Oldbag:
Of course! Didn't your momma teach you any sense, sonny? Anyone can plainly see that's Powers! Right?Edgeworth:
No, they can't! (Changed from [Um, yeah.] in the original release) ... Umm... well. I mean, I wonder? (Changed from [Umm... well. I wonder?] in the original release)Phoenix:
True, Mr. Powers does play the role of the Steel Samurai! But that doesn't mean Mr. Powers IS the Steel Samurai!Oldbag:
...! I... I know that! I wasn't born yesterday!Judge:
No one in this court is accusing you of that, Ms... er, witness.Phoenix:
(He's having trouble calling her "Oldbag" apparently...)Judge:
However, you do not have proof that the person in this photo is Mr. Will Powers, do you?Oldbag:
Humph! Nosy old man! Of course I have proof!Phoenix:
What!?Edgeworth:
Huh!?Phoenix:
(Even Edgeworth is surprised!?)Edgeworth:
The prosecution would like to ask the old... the witness. Please make known all the information in your possession ahead of time!Oldbag:
How was I to know everyone would be so nosy! You should be ashamed, all of you! Anyway, I showed that photo to the young detective. He told me "this isn't any good as evidence, pal." He didn't even give it a second look!Edgeworth:
...Phoenix:
(Wow, old windbag has left even Edgeworth speechless. She's good!)Judge:
Let's hear about your proof, then.Witness Testimony-- The Man in the Photo --Oldbag:
I never say anything I don't mean, mind you!
That morning, during the run-through of the action scene...
I saw Powers trip and fall!
He broke one of the props, it was a big mess.
Apparently, he sprained his ankle pretty bad.
Now, look at that picture!
You can see he's dragging his leg! See? Clear as day!
That's how I knew it was Powers. Happy?Judge:
Hmm. So he had sprained his ankle...? Very well. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Phoenix:

Phoenix:
(Hey, I haven't said anything yet!)
Oldbag:
I'll have you know I'm not pointing fingers at anyone behind their backs! Everything I've said is on the straight and narrow! The up and up! Youth today! Always whining about each other, pointing fingers this way and that! It's enough to make an old lady want to cry...
Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright! Please, for all our sakes, try not to upset the witness!
Phoenix:
(I think Edgeworth has met his match...)Oldbag:
That morning, during the run-through of the action scene...Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Who was present at the run-through?
Oldbag:
Well, let's see... There was Powers, he's the Steel Samurai... Then poor old Hammer, the Evil Magistrate. And... me.
Judge:
And what exactly were you doing?
Oldbag:
Observing! Just... observing.
Phoenix:
What about the assistant?
Oldbag:
Oh, she was off moving backdrops around and such.
Phoenix:
(So she didn't see the run-through, then...)Oldbag:
I saw Powers trip and fall!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
"Trip and fall"...?
Oldbag:
Yes! And to think, he's supposed to be the Steel Samurai! What a laugh! So Powers sprained his ankle. I helped make it better for him, of course.
Judge:
You... helped make it better?
Oldbag:
I kissed it where it hurt.
Judge:
L-let's just skip over that part, shall we?
Phoenix:
Where was the assistant then?
Oldbag:
Oh, her? She was cleaning up backdrops, I think. She didn't know about Powers's ankle.
Phoenix:
(Hmm...)
Edgeworth:
You may continue your testimony.Oldbag:
He broke one of the props, it was a big mess.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
He broke a prop?
Oldbag:
Sure did! His own Samurai Spear.
Phoenix:
(His Samurai Spear... the murder weapon!?)
Oldbag:
Luckily I was there with my duct tape to fix it.

Was Mr. Power's [sic] ankle badly sprained?
Oldbag:
Not so bad that he couldn't walk around. He went to his dressing room to rest up after lunch.
Phoenix:
(Thus the nap...)
Oldbag:
Anyway, I saw him dragging his foot when he walked.
Phoenix:
(Dragging his foot... okay.)Oldbag:
You can see he's dragging his leg! See? Clear as day!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Are you absolutely sure? (Let's take a look at that picture again... Hmm... so he was walking strangely because he was injured...)
Judge:
Hmm. It does look like he was dragging his foot.
Oldbag:
See! And you didn't trust me! Whippersnapper!Oldbag:
That's how I knew it was Powers. Happy?Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Still, you can't look at this and say it's Mr. Powers!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Yes, but only Mr. Powers would have been dragging his leg!
Judge:
He has a point. It does seem quite likely that it was Powers.
Phoenix:
(There's got to be more to this. I'd better keep pressing her.)Maya:
Well, Nick? Find any glaring contradictions?Phoenix:
Well, she seems pretty sure that was Powers in that photo... I guess I'll just press her and see if I can shake her conviction...After pressing second or third statement, then pressing fourth statement:Edgeworth:
I think we've heard enough! Haven't we, Your Honor?Judge:
Well, there is one thing that bothers me.Edgeworth:
Which is?Judge:
Where is this "Steel Samurai" costume now?Edgeworth:
Umm... hmm. Actually, well... We couldn't find it. We're looking, though.Judge:
Hmm...Edgeworth:
Anyway, that's not important! The witness did see the Steel Samurai, yes. And it is clear that the person in the Steel Samurai suit was Mr. Will Powers!Judge:
Hmm... I suppose that's right.Phoenix:
(Are you sure you're sure, Your Honor?)Object







Phoenix:
Hold it right there! We keep talking possibilities, but we have to agree that this photo shows the Steel Samurai! Nowhere in this photo can we see Mr. Will Powers!
Judge:
Hmm... The defense has a point. I also wonder if someone else not caught on camera could have killed Mr. Hammer. We have to consider that possibility, also.
Edgeworth:
Then allow me to remove that doubt from your mind, Your Honor...
Leads to:
"Will the witness continue her testimony, please?"Wait and see what happens







Phoenix:
(I think I'll wait and see where this goes.)
Judge:
I suppose, since there weren't any additional crew members at the studios that day... It's quite likely that it was the defendant inside that costume. I see no problem with this evidence.
Edgeworth:
Most perceptive, Your Honor!
Phoenix:
(He still doesn't seem that convinced to me... I hope.)

Old windbags have a way of skipping over important details, after all... Or, for that matter, entirely forgetting them.Maya:
How convenient.Phoenix:
(Something for you to look forward to, perhaps?)Phoenix:
Hold on! Look at this photograph one more time. This photo was taken by the camera at the gate for the studios, correct?Oldbag:
Yesiree, sonny.Phoenix:
So, whenever anyone passes by here, it automatically takes a picture?Oldbag:
And here I thought you didn't know your head from a hole in the ground.Phoenix:
Right... Anyway! It's also true that the computer in the guard station records all security cam data.Oldbag:
Ooh! You know, if you wanted to work at the studio, we might have an opening.Phoenix:
That very computer printed out this photo. Note that on the back of the photo are printed the words: [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2]Oldbag:
Even I know that means it was taken at 2:00 PM on October the 15th! Really, sonny!Phoenix:
Actually, I knew that too. The issure here is the bit at the end where it says: "Photo #2"...Oldbag:
"Photo #2"...?Phoenix:
The computer only held data for one photo on that day. Don't you think that's odd? Shouldn't this photo be "Photo #1" if it really was the ONLY photo!?Judge:
Order! Order! Please tell the court what you mean by this, Mr. Wright!Phoenix:
Actually, that's what I want to ask the witness. This evidence shows that not one, but two people went to the studio that day. Yet there is only data for one of the photos! Who could have erased the data for the other photo? Only someone with access-- the security lady herself! (Changed from [Only someone with access... the security lady herself!] in the original release)Oldbag:
Eh!? You watch your mouth, whippersnapper! The only person I saw that day was Will Powers!Phoenix:
But the camera on the gate fired twice! That means two people went by!Oldbag:
Umm... well, yes... that's what it would seem to mean...Judge:
Can the witness explain this to the court?Oldbag:
Umm... ahem. I-I don't understand these new-fangled computer things... Umm... E-Edgey-boy! Help!Edgeworth:
Huh!? B-believe me, I want to, but I don't know what this means either.Oldbag:

W-wait a second! Didn't you just say no one else could get in!? "I locked the main gate so no one could get in"... Those were your words!Oldbag:

They come in through the drain?Oldbag:
I told you they were freaks. Oh, and...Phoenix:
And...?Oldbag:
They're kids. Children. Whippersnappers.Phoenix:
K-kids!? So, on the photo that you erased...?Oldbag:
It was a boy. Probably 2nd or 3rd grade.Phoenix:
Whaaaaaaaaaaaat!?Judge:
O-order! Order! Let me get this straight. You saw two people pass by the gate on their way to the studios that day? One was the Steel Samurai, dragging his leg. The other was a boy who looked to be in about 2nd or 3rd grade?Oldbag:
Oh yes, well we see his type there every day. Can't stop 'em. Can't catch 'em.Edgeworth:
A boy in 2nd or 3rd grade? Hmm... I assume it would be hard, if not impossible for a young boy to wield the Samurai Spear?Judge:
Impossible, I'd think. It's quite heavy.Oldbag:
Right! As I said, I didn't pay him much mind. That's why I erased the data.Maya:
Um, Nick? What's going on? I mean, the boy was there, that makes him a suspect!Phoenix:
Yeah, and they're already trying to "un-suspect" him.Judge:
This court will take a five-minute recess. (Changed from [I'd like to take a five minute recess.] in the original release) I want the defense and the prosecution to consider this new information...

I-I didn't go to the studio! I was s-sleeping, honest.Maya:
So who was the "Steel Samurai" in that security photo?Will:
How should I know? The Steel Samurai costume was off in the corner of the dressing room. Anyone could have walked in and taken it, really.Maya:
What!? You should take better care of that stuff!Will:

First, we play for more time. We'll start targeting someone else that could conceivably have done this!Maya:
Right! And it'll take them so long to shoot us down that we can get another day!Phoenix:
Right... but if we pick the wrong person, we might lose on the spot.Will:
You... don't sound very optimistic.Phoenix:
I'm not optimistic at all, actually.Maya:
Hey, Nick. It's time.Phoenix:
Okay. Let's go. *sigh*Will:
What does that mean... Please don't sigh like that! *sniff*Judge:
Court will now reconvene for the trial of Mr. Will Powers. (Changed from [The court will now reconvene for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.] in the original release) Mr. Edgeworth, will you present the prosecution's thoughts on this matter?Edgeworth:
The prosecution's thoughts are simple. Nothing has changed. The other person who went to the studios was a boy of roughly 10 years of age. The photo we do have may not be hard evidence... But there is still no one else that could have committed this crime! I call for a verdict of "guilty" for the defendant, Mr. Will Powers!Judge:
Hmm... Very well. Mr. Wright, your thoughts?Phoenix:
The defense disagrees with the prosecution's claim. There IS another person who could have committed this crime!Judge:
Order! Interesting... Let us hear who you have in mind! However... Be aware that this court does not look kindly on accusing the innocent. If you accuse someone who is obviously innocent, you will be penalized.Phoenix:
(Right. Great. As if the stakes weren't high enough.)Judge:
So, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder?The assistant girl







Phoenix:
It was the assistant! The Steel Samurai costume was in his dressing room. She stole it, and in doing so she became the Steel Samurai!
Judge:
So you're saying the Steel Samurai in the picture is really the assistant?
Phoenix:
That's correct, Your Honor!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
If you're serious, you've got guts, Mr. Wright. Remember the photo? Wasn't the Steel Samurai a little lame!? He was dragging his foot!
Phoenix:
Oh. (Uh oh. Bad feeling time.)
Edgeworth:
Remember the testimony concerning Powers's injury!!!


Oldbag:
Powers and poor Hammer were at the run-through. Oh, and me.
Phoenix:
What about the assistant?
Oldbag:
Oh, her? She was cleaning up backdrops, I think. She didn't know about Powers's ankle.


Edgeworth:
The assistant knew nothing of Mr. Power's injury! She could look the Steel Samurai look with that costume... But she couldn't walk the the Steel Samurai walk! She wouldn't have limped!
Phoenix:
Ungh!
Maya:
That kind of takes the legs out from under that case...
Judge:
Mr. Wright. I'm afraid I have to penalize you, as I warned.
Phoenix:
(Nobody knows... the trouble I've seen...)
Judge:
May we move on, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
(Grr... this fight isn't over yet!) If you would, Your Honor, one more chance, please.
Judge:
Very well. Go ahead.
Leads back to:
"So, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder?"The grade-school boy







Phoenix:
It was the grade-school boy! ... ... ... Why isn't anyone saying anything?
Edgeworth:
Bah! Are you seriously suggesting the boy did it, Mr. Wright!? "Grade-school boy kills veteran action star with spear!" For one thing, it was the Steel Samurai holding the murder weapon. Would you care to explain just how the boy was involved?
Phoenix:
(Hmm... maybe that was a dumb move on my part.)
Maya:
"Maybe"? "Maybe"!? How about "absolutely," Nick!
Judge:
Mr. Wright. I'm afraid I have to penalize you, as I warned.
Phoenix:
(Nobody knows... the trouble I've seen...)
Judge:
May we move on, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
(Grr... this fight isn't over yet!) If you would, Your Honor, one more chance, please.
Judge:
Very well. Go ahead.
Leads back to:
"So, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder?"The security lady







Leads to:
"It was the security lady! Wendy Oldbag!"Phoenix:
It was the security lady! Wendy Oldbag!Oldbag:
W-who!?Phoenix:
The Steel Samurai is dragging his leg in this picture. That means whoever was in the suit knew about that morning's injury. Maybe because... they had been watching the action scene run-through! There was only one person other than Powers and Hammer who knew about the injury. The security lady, Oldbag!Oldbag:
W-what!? Whippersnapper!Judge:
Order! Order! I-is this true, Oldbag!?Oldbag:
Oldbag!? That's Ms. Oldbag to you!Phoenix:
Ms. Oldbag was standing guard alone at the main gate. She was by herself... in other words, she has no alibi! She could have briefly left her post to steal the the Steel Samurai costume... Then slipped into Studio One, the scene of the murder!Judge:
W-why would she go through the trouble of wearing the Steel Samurai costume!?Phoenix:
Simple, Your Honor. She knew the camera at the gate would take her picture. If she was in his costume, she could point the finger at Mr. Powers!Judge:
I see! Excellent deductive reasoning, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:
(Ohhh yeah, right here! Sherlock Holmes II, baby!) ...? (That's odd. Isn't this the part where Edgeworth pounces...? Doesn't he usually jump up with an objection and some new damning evidence...?)Judge:
Well, Mr. Edgeworth? Does the prosecution have an opinion on this matter?Edgeworth:
... The prosecution has no meaningful objections at this time.Oldbag:
W-w-what!? What's that supposed to mean!? Oh, so you all think I did it? Is that it!? Edgey-boy! Don't just sit there, do something!Phoenix:
(What's my move? Maybe now's my chance to take this the whole way?)Press further







Leads to:
"The very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case..."Give granny a break







Phoenix:
(I guess this does kind of make it look like she's the killer. Funny, I feel bad for her all of a sudden.)
Judge:
Hmm... It's true that the witness could conceivably have committed this crime. Yet we must not forget that the victim was an action hero. As formidable as her personality may be, I doubt she'd be strong enough.
Phoenix:
(Uh oh! If he removes her from consideration, that means Mr. Powers is it! Sorry, windbag... but I don't have a choice.)
Leads to:
"The very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case..."Phoenix:
The very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case... can be used to cast doubt on Ms. Oldbag's actions on that day!Oldbag:
B-but why would I do something so horrible to poor Hammer!?Phoenix:
You forget that Mr. Powers lacks a clear motive, too.Judge:
Hmm... Indeed.Phoenix:
(That did it. Now windbag is one of the suspects. No hard feelings... I hope.)Oldbag:
Wait just a minute! What about the other person who went to the studio!? The boy! The one whose photo I erased!Judge:
He's only a grade schooler though, as you said. 2nd or 3rd grade, was it?Oldbag:
Th-that doesn't matter! When I was that age, I could pin my old man in 10 seconds, tops!Judge:
Hmm... Your thoughts, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:
That boy is not the killer.Oldbag:
What!? How can you be so sure! Oh, or is it be nice to the kids and mean to your elders day? Whippersnapper!Phoenix:
I have proof.Oldbag:
P-proof!?Judge:
Indeed? Then let's see this proof, Mr. Wright. You have proof that shows the boy could not have committed this murder?Present Cardkey







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
The scene of the murder, as we all know, was Studio One. However, you need a cardkey to enter Studio One! How could a boy with no formal relation to the studios have a cardkey!?
Leads to:
"I see!"Present Powers's(?) Photo or Samurai Spear







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Your Honor! The murder weapon was the Samurai Spear. That very spear is shown here in this photo. How could the boy have taken the spear? It's impossible!
Leads to:
"I see!"Present anything else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
This is my proof!
Judge:
... I can't see how that has anything to do with this matter, Mr. Wright? Mr. Wright. There aren't that many pieces of evidence in the Court Record. Please try not to pick the wrong ones!
Phoenix:
S-sorry, Your Honor.
Judge:
I'll ask again, Mr. Wright.
Leads back to:
"You have proof that shows the boy could not have committed this murder?"Judge:
I see! Well, would the witness care to comment on this?Oldbag:
Mrph.Phoenix:
(The windbag... speechless. This has got to be a first.)Judge:
Very well! This court will suspend proceedings on the current trial for today. Mr. Edgeworth, please find out more about your witness, Ms. Windy... what was her name?Edgeworth:
Something "Oldbag," Your Honor.Judge:
Then the prosecution will look further into this Oldbag before we continue! That is all. The court is adjourned!Oldbag:
W-wait a second! I'm not going to just sit here while you run off barking up the wrong tree... me! I'm talking!Maya:
Oh, great, stop the presses! The windbag wants to talk!Judge:
Ms. Oldbag! What is this all about? Have you omitted something from your testimony?Oldbag:
Actually, if you must know, there's something I was told not to talk about.Phoenix:
N-not to talk about?Edgeworth:
By whom!?Phoenix:
(Huh? You mean it wasn't Edgeworth who told her not to talk...?)Judge:
W-well, testify!Witness Testimony-- My Lips Were Sealed --Oldbag:
Global Studios wanted me to keep quiet about something.
There were... some other people at the studios on the day of the murder.
They said they had "nothing to do with it," see?
So they told me to just pretend they "hadn't been at the studios that day."
But if you're going to go accusing me, I'm not letting them get away scot free!Judge:

Oldbag:
Yes, well, I was surprised no one asked about it.
Phoenix:
So, where were these people?
Oldbag:
The director was in the Employee Area all morning for the run-through. He joined the producer around lunchtime and they had a meeting after that.
Edgeworth:
Where!
Oldbag:
Oh, in the Studio Two trailer.

Whew, what a day.Maya:
This is no time for relaxing, Nick! Say, you think WP's got a chance?Phoenix:
I guess that really depends on the people we found out about in today's trial.Maya:
The director and producer...?Phoenix:
Yeah, them.Maya:
Well, what are we doing here then!? Let's get to the studios!Talk









What to do







Phoenix:
What do you think we should do?
Maya:
W-what do I... huh!? Why don't we do what you just said!? We gotta get the scoop on this director and producer.
Phoenix:
Oh, right. Then there's no point hanging out here.
Maya:
That's what I've been saying! Let's get to those studios pronto!




Any ideas







Maya:
Hmm. We don't have enough information to make a case yet.
Phoenix:
That's exactly the same thing you said yesterday! Just admit it: you don't have a clue what happened.
Maya:
There's not enough information!Present









Attorney's Badge







Phoenix:
Hey, see this?
Maya:
You... really like showing that off, don't you, Nick?




Cardkey







Maya:
Hey, you still have that! Great!
Phoenix:
Well, we couldn't get into the scene of the murder without it. And its owner isn't missing it in his detention cell...
Maya:
Poor old WP...




Powers's(?) Photo







Maya:
You know, what if this really was Mr. Powers?
Phoenix:
Yeah. It's hard to say. We don't really know anyone else it could be. I seriously doubt it was that old windbag.
Maya:
So Mr. Powers is... lying?
Phoenix:
He really doesn't seem the type, does he. (Curiouser and curiouser...)




Samurai Spear







Maya:
I wish I had my own Samurai Spear! You'd by my own personal pincushion, Nick!
Phoenix:
Me!? Why me!?




Anything else







Maya:
Sorry, I don't know how that will help us figure this out.October 18Detention CenterVisitor's RoomWill:
Oh, Mr. Wright! Thank you for earlier.Phoenix:
Not at all. We got lucky, to tell the truth.Maya:
You can say that again!Phoenix:
Let's not.Maya:
So, WP! Do you have any leads that might get us going in the right direction?Will:
Hmm... S-sorry, but no.Maya:
Be sure to tell us anything that comes to mind, no matter how small.Phoenix:
We can't rely on getting lucky again tomorrow.Will:

Security guard







Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room.Talk









The fanboy







Phoenix:
Do, er, "fanboys" sneak into the studios often?
Will:
No, not that I know of. That security lady's pretty strict with them.
Maya:
But, in today's testimony, didn't she say they were often hanging around?
Will:
The kids really, really love the Steel Samurai. They sneak past when she's not looking, I guess.




The director







Phoenix:
Was the director present at the morning run-through?
Will:
Y-yes, yes he was. He was directing how the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate should move.
Maya:
Why didn't you tell us that before!?
Will:
W-well, just, the studio asked us to keep quiet...
Maya:
That has nothing to do with this! I hate to repeat myself, but Nick here is a newbie lawyer! Fresh off the bar! When he loses, he's going to lose big!
Will:
I... I see. *sniff*
Phoenix:
(Whose side is she on!?)
Maya:
You aren't hiding anything else from us, are you!?
Will:
N-no, I sure hope not.Present









Cardkey







Phoenix:
We found this cardkey in your dressing room.
Will:
Oh, that's mine, yes.
Maya:
Can people outside the studios get these cards?
Will:
I don't think so. Even I have to return the card. Once the show's done filming, that is.
Maya:
Huh...




Powers's(?) Photo







Phoenix:
Regarding this photograph...
Will:
Y-yes...?
Phoenix:
This really, truly, absolutely isn't you, right?
Will:
R-right. *sniff* I was sleeping in my dressing room the whole time, honest.
Phoenix:
But who else could have worn it!?
Maya:
Your costume was in your dressing room?
Will:
Yes. I guess they snuck in and took it while I was asleep.
Phoenix:
(But who!?)




Samurai Spear







Phoenix:
Regarding the murder weapon...
Will:
Yes?
Phoenix:
Is it heavy, that spear?
Will:
It's pretty hefty, yeah. I don't think the average person would be able to swing it around effectively.
Phoenix:
Hmm...
Maya:
And... that's the spear that broke or something during the morning run-through?
Will:
Oh yes, I goofed on a round kick, you see... I broke the spear. The security lady fixed it for me right away though.
Maya:
With duct tape. We heard.




Anything else







Will:
E-excuse me. Thank you for showing me that, whatever it is. I wish I could think of some way I could help you... S-sorry. *sniff*October 18, 2:16 PMGlobal StudiosMain GateMaya:
No one's here.Phoenix:
Right, now that they have Ms. Oldbag in custody. I guess they don't have anyone else to replace her...Maya:
H-hey! In the guard station! Look! She left her donuts! ... ... What? I wasn't going to eat them!Examine









Computer







Phoenix:
The computer that runs the studio security cameras. Huh? It looks like it's been turned off for the day.




Guard station







Phoenix:
The security guard station. Ms. Oldbag must like junk food. There's a mountain of it on the desk in there.




Main gate







Phoenix:
The main entrance to the studios. They probably have a police officer on patrol out there.October 18Studio One EntranceMaya:
Hey, Nick. It looks like Detective Gumshoe isn't here today.Phoenix:
You're right. He's probably up to his neck in paperwork after the commotion at today's trial.Maya:
So, Nick... Remember that "Studio Two" we heard about at the trial today? It was down that path with the fallen tree, right?Phoenix:
Yeah, I think that's what they said.Maya:
Maybe the director and the rest of them are there today? Now's our chance, Nick! Let's check it out!Examine









Bench







Phoenix:
I'm bushed. Maybe I'll sit down here for a bit.
Maya:
This is exactly why I don't want to get old, ever.
Phoenix:
H-hey! I'm still young! I'm just tired!
Maya:
Nick, when you start having to say "I'm still young," you know it's all over.
Phoenix:
(But... but I AM still young!)




Left path







Phoenix:
In the trial, they said Studio Two was down this path. The monkey head is in the way, but we should be able to get by it without a problem.
Maya:
This monkey head is real heavy!
Phoenix:
Well, it did knock that tree over when it fell.
Maya:
Both of these, the monkey head and the tree, fell the day of the murder, didn't they.
Phoenix:
Yeah, that's what Detective Gumshoe said.




Statue with broken head







Phoenix:
The studio mascot. Apparently it's a monkey of some kind. I've never seen a monkey with a nose like that before!
Maya:
Why don't they put his head back on? Maybe we should ask that assistant?
Phoenix:
I'm not sure we really want her fixing anything. And you'd probably need a crane to move that thing.
Maya:
Probably so.




Security camera







Phoenix:
That's the security camera that automatically takes pictures of people here. It took two pictures on the day of the murder, before the actual time of death. One of them was the Steel Samurai. The other was a grade school boy. It doesn't seem to be switched on today.




Studio One entrance







Phoenix:
The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.




Welcome sign







Maya:
It says "Welcome."
Phoenix:
They let people in here when they're not filming, right?
Maya:
Nick! Let's come here some day! Whaddya say?
Phoenix:
Sure, if that security lady lets us in.October 18Studio OneMaya:
I... don't really want to be in here.Phoenix:
Yeah... It is a murder scene.Maya:
I want to go someplace else. Nick?Phoenix:

Film camera







Maya:
Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!
Phoenix:
Yeah! So don't touch it!
Maya:
Hey, smile, Nick, you're a star!
Phoenix:
S-stop that!




Reflecting screen







Phoenix:
That's for reflecting light. They call it a reflecting screen or something like that.
Maya:
Huh.
Phoenix:
What? Where's your enthusiasm for all things entertainment?
Maya:
Well, lighting is fine, but I'd want to be the director. Or maybe the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
(I think she's being serious...!)




Stage backdrop







Phoenix:
Looks like a backdrop for a stage. This must be used in the Steel Samurai show.
Maya:
Of course! That's the mountain, Neo Fujiyama!
Phoenix:
Doesn't the Steel Samurai take place in Olde Tokyo? Can you even see Mt. Fuji from there?
Maya:
Not Olde Tokyo, Nick! "Neo" Olde Tokyo!October 18Studio Two EntranceMaya:
This... is Studio Two?Phoenix:
I thought so...Maya:
It doesn't really look much like a "studio," does it?Phoenix:
No, that it does not.Maya:
Hey... There's a trailer over there.Phoenix:
It looks pretty sturdy for a movie set trailer.Maya:
Are we sure this is a studio?Examine









Incinerator







Phoenix:
An incinerator. Apparently they just put this one in. It's already covered in soot. They must not clean it much.




Lunch table







Phoenix:
Looks like two people ate here. There's nothing left on the plates.
Maya:
Hey, so they ate t-bone steaks too.
Phoenix:
What is it with steaks around here?
Maya:
Hey! There's always room for steak! But... something does seem out of place...
Phoenix:
What?
Maya:
I... don't know. It just feels "odd."




Number "2" sign







Phoenix:
There's a big "2" painted here.
Maya:
Probably because this is Studio Two?
Phoenix:
Probably... Though it doesn't look anything like a studio.




Studio van







Phoenix:
A light van for moving staff and equipment around. They've kept it in pretty good shape. Looks like it'd run fine.
Maya:
Well, let's go for a drive!
Phoenix:
Sure... if I had a license.
Maya:
Nick! You don't have a driver's license!?
Phoenix:
But, look, I have this!
Maya:
Why are you showing me your attorney's badge, Nick?




Flower garden







Phoenix:
There're some flowers here.
Maya:
Wow, so pretty! They're taking good care of these.
Phoenix:
Don't get to [sic] close. That fence looks dangerous.




Storage materials







Phoenix:
These look like materials for making a movie set.
Maya:
They've been sitting here for quite some time. This might as well be a junkyard.




Trailer







Phoenix:
On closer inspection, this trailer looks like it's been here for a while. I don't think this is part of some temporary film set.




Trailer door







Maya:
Nick! Let's go inside!
Phoenix:
You think it's okay...? Oh well. It's locked.

Um, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to the guard station. I'm supposed to fill in for Ms. Oldbag.Maya:
Right! See you later, then!Penny:
Good luck with your investigation.Examine









Taped cardboard barrier







Maya:
So, the fanboy they were talking about in the trial today... He came in through that drain?
Phoenix:
So it seems. I guess they covered it up in a hurry.
Maya:
Hey... Hey, Nick! If that drain's covered, the boy won't be able to get in.
Phoenix:
Uh, yeah. I think that was the idea...?
Maya:
I feel kinda sorry for him, though. Don't you?
Phoenix:
What, you want to rip the grate off?
Maya:
Really, Nick? We can!?
Phoenix:
(Whoa... she's serious? Uh oh...)



Rip it open







Phoenix:
Well, I guess some things are just made to be broken.
Maya:
Yay! You know, Nick, you're pretty swell sometimes.
Phoenix:
(Sometimes...?)
Maya:
Hiii-ya! There. That should make the kids happy.
Phoenix:
The things we do...
Leads back to examination




Leave it be







Phoenix:
Nah, I think we should leave it on. They only just repaired it. And if we take it off, that assistant will get yelled at by you-know-who.
Maya:
Yeah... I guess so.
Phoenix:
(Wow! I didn't expect her to take it that hard...)
Leads back to examination





Drain grate (after selecting "Rip it open" upon examining taped cardboard barrier)







Phoenix:
The drain grate is off. And I know who did it.
Maya:
Now the kids'll be able to come in again. Doesn't it make you feel great to do a good deed like that?
Phoenix:
(Must be nice to live so free of guilt.)




Lunch table







Phoenix:
The remains of yesterday's lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak.




Dressing room door







Phoenix:
The door to the dressing room. It's not locked.
Maya:
Hey, Nick! Let's go in! Maybe there'll be something else to steal?
Phoenix:
H-hey! We're not thieves!
Maya:
But we did take that cardkey...
Phoenix:
W-we borrowed that! There's a difference.




Vending machine







Phoenix:
Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks or something. Popcorn, at least!
Maya:
W-wait! Look! "Samurai Soda"! Nick! Try this!
Phoenix:
Be my guest.
Maya:
Okay! Oh, too bad, it's sold out.October 18Global StudiosDressing RoomMaya:
This is where the Steel Samurai costume was, on the day of the murder.Phoenix:
That's what Mr. Powers says, at least. I guess they snuck in and took it while he was sleeping.Maya:
But Nick, what if Mr. Powers hadn't been sleeping? I wonder what the killer was planning on doing then?Phoenix:
Huh... (She's got a point!)Examine









Cosmetics







Phoenix:
There's an array of cosmetics here. According to Maya, that wig was used in some old TV show...
Maya:
"Samurai Boogey-Woogey," Nick! Get with the picture!
Phoenix:
Look, explain to me how you can identify a show just by seeing a wig!?
Maya:
I, um, kinda like samurai movies.
Phoenix:
("Kinda"...?)




Costume rack







Phoenix:
There's some regular suits in among the costumes here. Those must be Mr. Powers's personal clothes.




Couch







Phoenix:
Looks like someone was sleeping here. Maybe Powers did take a nap here, like he said.




Bag







Maya:
Mr. Powers's bag. I wonder what's inside? Hey! Supermarket tabloids? Wow. I'm kind of shocked.
Phoenix:
Maya! Leave those alone! (Wolf Men Found On Mars...? I'll have to buy that issue!)




Table







Phoenix:
There's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Some tea and cookies...
Maya:
Wait... Nick!
Phoenix:
W-what now?
Maya:
These snacks... they've passed the expiration date!
Phoenix:
... Then don't eat them.
Maya:
*grumble* (They're snacks! They're meant to be eaten!)




Window







Phoenix:
It's locked. I guess he doesn't open his window much. It is kind of dusty outside.Studio - Main Gate (after selecting "Rip it open" upon examining taped cardboard barrier in Global Studios - Employee Area)Penny:
Oh... hello.Maya:
Ho hoh! You look a little out of place.Penny:
It's the clothes, isn't it? I thought my camo vest might do the trick... Kind of an "alternative guard fashion" thing.Examine









Guard station







Phoenix:
The security guard station. I can see the computer that runs the security cameras.
Penny:
Oh, please don't touch anything in there. The security lady would knock the stuffing out of me if she knew.Talk









The studios







Phoenix:
So, how are the studios doing?
Penny:
There's police wandering around everywhere, it's terrible. They won't even let me clean up. Don't want me "disturbing evidence." I haven't even cleaned up our lunch plates from the day of the murder!
Phoenix:
You mean those plates with the steak bones left over on them in the employee area?
Penny:
Yeah. Can you believe it?




The fanboy







Maya:
Do kids sneak in here a lot?
Penny:
Well... I don't think there's that many of them, but I do see one in particular a bunch. He's always gawking at the sets, or snapping pictures. You should see Old Windbag's eyes flash when she sees him. She has a bit of trouble catching him though...




The director, et al.







Phoenix:
I heard something at the trial today. They said that the director and producer were here the day of the murder...
Penny:
Oh, sorry... I was in the prop storage room, so I didn't see them. I guess they were here, though. The studio head seemed pretty eager to keep us quiet.
Maya:
So they were trying to protect the director?
Penny:
More the producer, really. The producer's our real star here. She saved these studios from the brink of disaster and kept them running. I don't think we'd still be in business if it weren't for that producer!
Phoenix:
(The producer, huh?)Present









Cardkey







Penny:
Wow, they gave a lawyer one of those cardkeys?
Phoenix:
Well, I'm sort of borrowing it.
Penny:
I see. You better be careful not to lose that. They're very strict about those cardkeys here.
Phoenix:
(I guess they're pretty good about keeping these out of outsider's hands.) Thanks, I'll be careful.




Powers's(?) Photo







Phoenix:
Could you take a look at this?
Penny:
That's Mr. Powers. Why is he dragging his leg like that? What is this, anyway?
Phoenix:
(Looks like she didn't know about this photo or the injury that morning.) Uh... Never mind.




Samurai Spear







Phoenix:
Say, you work with the props, right? About that murder weapon...
Penny:
You mean the Samurai Spear? Yeah, it's a prop, but it's still pretty heavy. I hate having to carry that thing around.
Phoenix:
(So you'd have to be pretty strong to use that as a weapon, it sounds like. Why is Mr. Powers the only person I can think of!?)

The day of the crime







Phoenix:
Did you notice anything unusual on the day of the murder?
Manella:
Oh, I know who j00 d00dz are. That security lady told j00 about us, eh?
Phoenix:
That's right.
Manella:
It was a pretty regular day. We had a run-through for an action scene in the morning. Then a meeting from lunchtime in the Studio Two trailer. Heh. I was so busy I didn't even get a chance to eat lunch! :(
Phoenix:
A t-bone steak, was it?
Manella:
Yeah... sux0rz! I hate missing out on food...
Maya:
Nick... what does "Sucksores" mean?
Phoenix:
No idea...
Manella:
Anyway, I was in a meeting from noon till after 4:00. With the producer, and some bigwigs from the network.
Phoenix:
(Mr. Hammer's time of death was estimated at 2:30 PM. If he's telling the truth, that meeting gives him an alibi...)




The producer (appears after "The day of the crime")







Phoenix:
About the producer who was at the meeting with you...
Manella:
Oh, you mean Dee Vasquez? She's a genius. M4d sk1llz, all the way. Scary, though. *sweats* She brought these studios back from the brink of destruction. She's the one who made it possible for me to make the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
You had a meeting with her on the day of the murder, right?
Manella:
Yeah, we were together from noon to 4:00 PM, the whole time.




The bigwigs (appears after "The day of the crime")







Phoenix:
Who exactly are these "bigwigs" people keep mentioning?
Manella:
Oh, the boss over at the network, and some sponsors. Also a few production guys. They piled into a limousine and got here right around noon. Major tension! *sweats*
Phoenix:
Were all of them with you the entire time?
Manella:
Yeah, unfortunately. They're all gray-haired geezers... *scowl*

Powers's(?) Photo







Manella:

So, do you have any ideas about who might have done this?
Mia:
We don't have enough information to make a case yet.
Phoenix:
(Where have I heard that phrase before? So THAT's where Maya got it from...)Present









Anything







Mia:
Showing me that isn't going to do any good. You know what they say, "Dead men don't tell tales."
Phoenix:
(You sure are talking enough!)October 18Detention CenterVisitor's RoomPhoenix:
I guess Mr. Powers is in questioning...Mia:
Oh well. Let's try again another day, Phoenix.October 18Global StudiosMain GateOldbag:

(Sounds like she hasn't had any luck catching him.)Oldbag:
Huff... puff... I...  I got a hostage now, whippersnapper!Phoenix:
(A "hostage"...!?)Talk









The fanboy







Phoenix:
Umm... what happened to the boy?
Oldbag:
I-if I see him a-again, I'll... huff! L-lay him flat! Huff... puff...
Mia:
My, what a violent old lady...




The director, et al.







Phoenix:
Actually, I met with the director just now...
Oldbag:
Eh? Hah... my heart, it don't feel so good.
Phoenix:
(Is she okay!?)
Oldbag:
B-before I go, I'd like to v-visit the place where poor H-Hammer died...
Phoenix:
(Right... she was saying she wanted to visit the studio where he died.)




The "hostage"







Phoenix:
What's this about a "hostage"?
Oldbag:
Huff... huff... W-when that boy was running away... ...he dropped this, a-and ran! Huff... huff... H-he'll come back... huff... huff... for this one!
Phoenix:
(It's kind of hard to understand her with all that huffing and puffing.)
Mia:
Phoenix! That "hostage" might be what we need! Cody might talk to us if we gave him that!
Phoenix:
(Good idea!) Ms. Oldbag! Might I...
Oldbag:
No! I'm catching that brat if it's the last thing I do!
Mia:
Phoenix. Do you have anything you might trade with her?
Phoenix:
(A trade, hmm... I wonder...?)Present









Cardkey







Oldbag:
H-hey... that... huff... That's a card... huff... Studio One?
Phoenix:
Right. A cardkey to Studio One.
Oldbag:
Huff... puff... I... I could visit poor Hammer... I'd like to visit... huff... he died... whew. I was his... his fan.
Phoenix:
You don't have your own card, Ms. Oldbag?
Oldbag:
Studio One isn't my turf. Huff... huff... You'll let me borrow... borrow it, then?
Phoenix:
(If I give her the cardkey, then I won't be able to get into Studio One...!)



Keep the cardkey







Phoenix:
Sorry, we have our own investigating to do there.
Oldbag:
Huff... huff... puff. Poo.
Phoenix:
(Was that last bit a breath, or a pout...?)
Leads back to Court Record




Lend her the cardkey







Leads to:
"Why don't you let her borrow it, Phoenix?"





Powers's(?) Photo







Oldbag:
I... I told you who I s-saw! Huff! Huff... it... it was Powers!
Phoenix:
(Well, at least she's consistent...)




Trailer Key







Phoenix:
Ms. Oldbag? I'm borrowing this... just so you know.
Oldbag:
Oh... o-okay... huff. J-just be sure to... huff... give it b-back... puff.
Phoenix:
(She's not as demanding when she's exhausted.)




Anything else







Oldbag:
Huff... huff... puff... ... huff... puff... haaah! ... Huff.. huff... puff... huff... puff... huff... hooo!
Phoenix:
(She's too busy catching her breath to tell me anything!)Mia:
Why don't you let her borrow it, Phoenix?Phoenix:
I guess it can't hurt. Here you go, Ms. Oldbag.Cardkey lent to Ms. Oldbag.Oldbag:
... Listen to me, sonny. I don't like having debts to no whippersnappers. You take this, and we're even. Deal?Phoenix:
What's this...? A Steel Samurai trading card?Oldbag:
That sneaky kid dropped it! I figure it's pretty important to him, though.Phoenix:
Thank you, I may have a use for this. (This must be the "hostage" she was talking about.)Steel Samurai Card added to the Court Record.Oldbag:

Welcome sign







Phoenix:
"Welcome"... I wonder if the murder will make this place famous, too.Inside Studio OneExamine









Director's chair







Phoenix:
A classic director's chair. I'm surprised they don't have an extra large one for Mr. Manella.




Film camera







Phoenix:
A collection of expensive film equipment. I can't even begin to imagine how much just one of these costs. If we broke one, we'd go bankrupt for sure.




Reflecting screen







Phoenix:
A panel for reflecting light. They call it a "reflecting board" or something.




Stage backdrop







Phoenix:
A stage backdrop. This is "Neo Fujiyama," according to Maya. It looks incredibly fake, but I guess the kids don't mind.




(Step)ladder







Phoenix:
A perfectly normal stepladder. I've never actually used one. I don't like heights. I'm a firm belever that humankind was made to keep both feet on the ground.Outside Studio TwoExamine









Lunch table







Phoenix:
Looks like two people ate here. There's nothing left on the plates.




Number "2" sign







Phoenix:
There's a big "2" painted here. Probably because this is Studio Two? Probably... Though it doesn't look anything like a studio.




Studio van







Phoenix:
A light van for moving staff and equipment around. They've kept it in pretty good shape. Looks like it'd run fine.




Flower garden







Phoenix:
Nameless flowers bloom in solitude. They probably have a proper name... But it is not for me to know. Not now, nor ever till the end of my days. ... I need a vacation.




Storage materials







Phoenix:
These look like materials for making a movie set. They've been sitting here for quite some time. This might as well be a junkyard.




Trailer door







Phoenix:
The door is unlocked. We could probably just walk right in.TrailerExamine









Left poster







Phoenix:
Another old movie poster. "'The Singing Samurai' starring Jack Hammer." What the hell do samurai sing about? Chopping off heads?
Mia:
It's a samurai musical set in ancient Japan.
Phoenix:
A s-samurai musical? Is that even a genre!? Well, I'm impressed. You know your stuff, Mia.
Mia:
Oh, Maya's the real fan. I just picked a little up.




Middle poster







Phoenix:
"'Samurai Summer' starring Jack Hammer." This poster looks like it's been hanging here for years.
Mia:
This is one of Maya's favorite movies.
Phoenix:
Maybe we should replace the poster in the office with this one?
Mia:
That... would be kind of sad.October 18Global StudiosEmployee AreaPhoenix:
Hey! Hey, you! W-wait a sec!Mia:
... Phoenix... Was that the boy?Phoenix:
Yeah. His name's "Cody Hackins."Mia:
I think he ran into the dressing room.Examine









Bicycle







Phoenix:
Looks like one of those electric-powered bicycles. I dunno about these. I mean, what's the point?
Mia:
It makes it a lot easier to go up hills!
Phoenix:
Where have I heard that line before...?




Dressing room door







Phoenix:
The door to the dressing room. It's not locked.
Mia:
This is where Cody ran... Let's go in and see if we can get him to talk.




Storage room door







Phoenix:
That must be the storage room. That's where they keep all the film equipment.




Vending machine







Phoenix:
Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks, or something. Popcorn, at least!
Mia:
Look at this! "Spaghetti in a Soda Can"...?
Phoenix:
S-spaghetti? Wouldn't just the sauce come out and the noodles all stay stuck inside?
Mia:
"Best when slammed." I guess they want you to drink it in one gulp...?
Phoenix:
Slamming spaghetti. Right...October 18Global StudiosDressing RoomPhoenix:

Cosmetics







Phoenix:
There's an array of cosmetics here. According to Maya, that wig was used in some old TV show...
Cody:
You don't know "Samurai Boogey-Woogey"!? You're even lamer than I thought!
Phoenix:
(Why does everybody but me know about this show!?)




Powers's bag







Phoenix:
Mr. Powers's bag.
Mia:
Now, Phoenix, it's not polite to look through other people's belongings.
Phoenix:
H-hey, don't look at me! (Tell that to your sister!)




Table







Phoenix:
There's a box of snacks on the table, and some cans of soda. They're all empty. I'm glad Maya isn't here to see this. She'd be devastated.
Mia:
Sorry? What was that about Maya?
Phoenix:
O-oh, nothing.Talk









The Steel Samurai







Phoenix:
The Steel Samurai's so cool. I think he's the, um, the "bomb."
Cody:
Hah! What would a lamer like you know about the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
H-hey, watch that attitude!
Mia:
Phoenix, you really should't yell like that. He's only a kid.
Cody:
Yeah! Don't yell like that I'm only a kid!




What happened







Phoenix:
So, do you know anything about what happened here? Could you tell me, please?
Cody:
I don't know nothing!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... looks like a little persuasion's necessary. Maybe a bribe...?)Present









Powers's(?) Photo







Cody:
Hey, it's the Steel Samurai. Huh? Why's he dragging his foot like that? Where'd you get this, anyway?




Samurai Spear







Cody:
The Samurai Spear! That's totally cool. I wish I had one, too...
Phoenix:
(This kid and Maya would get along great.)




Steel Samurai Card







Phoenix:
Cody... This look familiar?
Cody:
Hey! My UR!
Phoenix:
"You are"... huh?
Cody:
"U.R." You know, "ultra rare"! That card's really hard to get! Man, for a grown-up, you sure are dumb!
Phoenix:
I'll give you this... IF you help me.
Cody:
But that's my card! By offering me something I already own, you're in effect eschewing the very basis of our consumer society, namely the principle of fair trade! Man, for a grown-up, you sure are dumb!
Phoenix:
(W-what do they teach these kids in school these days!? Quantum physics!?)
Cody:
Whatever, I don't need that card.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Cody:
I got a double. Just keep it. It's yours.
Phoenix:
(What!? After I went through all that trouble...)
Cody:
If you want to trade, find me a REALLY rare card!
Phoenix:
"Really rare"!? You mean there's something rarer than "Ultra Rare"!?
Cody:
Ultra Rare Premium cards are way rarer than plain Ultra Rare cards! Come ON! Man, for a grown-up, you sure are dumb!
Phoenix:
Premium... rare... why do I feel like we're talking about steaks?

The fanboy







Phoenix:
Have you seen that boy since then?
Penny:
Nope. You missed it, though. The security lady was chasing around after the boy so fast I thought she'd collapse. Of course, he got away in the end. Boy, was she mad!
Phoenix:
Actually, we saw them. How's the old windbag doing?
Penny:
She was squeezing donuts through her clenched fists back at the guard station.
Phoenix:
(Some people take their jobs a little too seriously.)




Mr. Hammer







Phoenix:
Are all the posters on the wall here of Hammer?
Penny:
Yes. It's really a terrible loss for the studios.
Phoenix:
But... his popularity had been waning recently, right?
Penny:
That's true. Then again, after what happened...
Phoenix:
After WHAT happened?
Penny:
Y-you mean, you don't know about Hammer...?

No, what?

The Steel Samurai







Phoenix:
So... you like the Steel Samurai.
Cody:
He's so cool!
Phoenix:
I... I guess.
Cody:
You're judging him by his looks! You have to look at his actions, at his life!

Cody:
You like him too, don'tcha?

Uh... Oh, me? Y-yeah! I, um, love the Steel Samurai.

Thanks for this.

Hey, I gave that to the nice lady, not you, loser! No looking at that, okay!

Cody... I need to ask you something very important. What did you see on the day of the incident?Cody:
... I got here that day around 2:00... I had to come in through the woods out back so that old lady wouldn't see me. I got kinda lost, though. I was in there for maybe a half hour or so. Then I finally got to the studio. After that...Mia:
What is it, Cody?Cody:
Th-the Steel Samurai killed the bad guy! He used his Samurai Spear! Just like always! One shot, one kill! It happened so fast... I got scared. I went home after that.Phoenix:
I... I see. It must have been hard for you.Cody:
Man, you say those nice things but it's so obvious you aren't speaking from the heart.Phoenix:
(Umm... right.) Mia?Mia:
Yes?Phoenix:
I think we can say for sure this means the Steel Samurai did it.Mia:
True enough.Phoenix:
And the director has an alibi, so it wasn't him.Mia:
Indeed.Phoenix:
So... the only person left who it could have been is Will Powers!Mia:
... I have to admit, it's kind of a shock. But if you put this boy on the witness stand, your client will be "guilty" for sure.Phoenix:
Let's not call him then...Mia:
I think that would be wise. Best to leave this one alone.???:
Not so fast, pal!Gumshoe:
I heard everything! This boy here's a key witness! And he's under police protection, starting now! C'mon, son. You've got a rendezvous with me down at the precinct!Cody:

Yes?Will:
Why do you look so... unhappy?Phoenix:
O-oh! Oh, nothing! Eh heh heh. Really, it's nothing. Right, Mia? (Uh oh. She looks even unhappier...)Mia:
Phoenix. Your client is now practically a dead man walking... Perhaps that's why I feel particularly close to him.Phoenix:
This is no time for dead-people jokes, please.Mia:
You know we're going into this trial utterly defenseless. Yet, if Mr. Powers is truly innocent... We should be able to find something overlooked in the evidence to prove it.Phoenix:
Something "overlooked"...?Mia:
We have to find something, Phoenix, today. It's that, or lose the trial.Phoenix:
(This isn't going to be easy.)October 19, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:
Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth:
An unexpected fact has come to the attention of the court. Yesterday, we learned that there were other people present at the studios. Today, I would like to show evidence proving they had nothing to do with the murder.Judge:
Very well. You may call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth.Phoenix:
(I wonder if it'll be that producer...) (Changed from [I wonder if that producer is going to come out...] in the original release)Edgeworth:
The prosecution calls Mr. Sal Manella to the stand.Phoenix:
(...or that director.)Edgeworth:
Will the witness state his name and profession?Manella:
... How r00d can j00 get! J00 don't know ME!? I'm the director! I make the Steel Samurai, n00b! ROFL!Edgeworth:
...Manella:
S... Sal Manella. I'm a director. Television.Judge:
Were you at Global Studios on the day of the murder?Manella:
Y-yes, Your Honor.Judge:
Hmm... Very well. Please testify to the court about the events of that day.Mia:
Phoenix. Let's start by picking this testimony apart. If Powers is innocent, you know what that means. Someone in the trailer on that day did it!Phoenix:
R-right. (She doesn't waste any time putting on the pressure!)Witness Testimony-- The Day of the Murder --Manella:
I was at the studios from around 9:00 that morning.
During the morning, I was doing... umm... an action scene run-through.
It took a lot more time than I thought it would.
I hear that everyone else ate lunch in the Employee Area...
But I had a meeting in the Studio Two trailer, so I ended up skipping lunch.
We were in the meeting until around 4:00...
During the meeting, well, I'm pretty sure no one left their chairs.
That's about it.Judge:
Hmm... The time of Mr. Hammer's death was 2:30 PM. And according to your testimony, you were in a meeting at that time. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.Cross Examination-- The Day of the Murder --Manella:
I was at the studios from around 9:00 that morning.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Is that when you always come in to work?
Manella:
Oh, oh no. I come in all sort of hours. It's the "industry" way.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, I know all about the freaks in your "industry"...)
Manella:
Still, FWIW, I was pretty busy all that day. :(
Edgeworth:
Tell us more about that.Manella:
During the morning, I was doing... umm... an action scene run-through.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
In the Employee Area?
Manella:
That's right. It was a fight scene between the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate.
Phoenix:
Was anyone else at the run-through?
Manella:
Oh, yeah. That security lady was sitting there watching the whole thing. LOL. She was cheering on Hammer, if you can believe it.
Phoenix:
(She certainly has the lungs for it...) Anyone else?
Manella:
Nope, just us four.Manella:
It took a lot more time than I thought it would.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Why did it go on so long?
Manella:
Um, I'm pretty sure j00've already heard about this... But WP twisted his ankle during the run-through, see...
Phoenix:
(Oh, right, thus the limp.)
Manella:
Which of course led to me missing my lunch. ROFS!
Phoenix:
(ROFS? Rolling on the Floor... Starving?)Manella:
I hear that everyone else ate lunch in the Employee Area...Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What exactly did they have for lunch?
Manella:
T-bone steak! The assistant cooked some up.
Phoenix:
(Come to think of it, there was a plate with some bones on it in the Employee Area.)
Edgeworth:
"Everyone else" meaning that the witness did not eat with them.Manella:
But I had a meeting in the Studio Two trailer, so I ended up skipping lunch.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So, in the end, you didn't get to eat?
Manella:
Yeah. No steak, at least! Can j00 believe it?
Phoenix:
That must have been tough.
Mia:
Phoenix.
Phoenix:
Yeah?
Mia:
Doesn't something about that seem odd to you?



Not at all







Phoenix:
Well, no, not really. Seems pretty straightforward.
Mia:
Oh. Perhaps I was wrong, then.
Leads back to cross-examination




It's a little vague







Phoenix:
Actually, there is something bothering me. Mr. Manella, just now you said "steak, at least." So you ate something other than steak?
Manella:
Yeah, good call! I had some chocolate in my pocket, which I used to stave off starvation!
Phoenix:
I see... (Is that all? I was sure I was on to something there.)
Leads back to cross-examination




It's contradictory







Phoenix:
Yeah, it does seem odd, now that you mention it. Mr. Manella!
Manella:
H-hmm? W-what do j00 mean? *sweats*
Phoenix:
When I went to Studio Two, I saw something on the table there. (Changed from [When I went to that trailer, I saw something on the table.] in the original release) There were two plates--the same kind of plates as the ones in the Employee Area. (Changed from [There were two plates on the table--the same kind of plates as in the Employee Area.] in the original release) Who ate lunch there?
Manella:
M-mmpf! No, er, ah, um, eh heh. Good call! *sweats* I, er, I was embarrassed so I didn't mention it... But I did eat, after all.
Phoenix:
A t-bone steak, you mean?
Manella:
Yeah, well, I mean the assistant went through all that trouble... I brought it to the trailer thinking I could eat it later.
Phoenix:
(Clearly a man who likes to eat. I'd suspected as much...) So, when exactly did you eat it?
Manella:
We took one break during that meeting. I, er, wolfed it down then. *drool*
Phoenix:
(A mental image I will carry with me to my grave... Wait a second...! If they took a break in that meeting, that contradicts his testimony! I'll press on that one a bit more...)
Leads back to cross-examinationManella:
We were in the meeting until around 4:00...Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What were you discussing?
Manella:
The Steel Samurai story, and our budget. Get this! The sponsors turn to me and say, "Mr. Manella. Those scripts of yours are not appropriate for children." Can j00 believe it!?
Phoenix:
(Actually, I kind of can.) So, nobody left the table during the whole meeting?Manella:
During the meeting, well, I'm pretty sure no one left their chairs.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
You didn't take a single break?
Manella:
Er... well... Y-yeah! Not a one! *sweats*

Press harder







Leads to:
"Wait a second!"




Leave him be







Phoenix:
(No, on second thought, I'm drawing a blank. If I press too hard in the wrong place, I'll just end up scaring him into silence. Maybe I'll just sit back and see what happens.)
Leads back to cross-examinationMia:
Phoenix. If his alibi holds, Powers is finished. Press him as hard as you can and find out where he's lying!Phoenix:
R-right!Phoenix:
Wait a second! Mr. Manella, you've just contradicted yourself! Didn't you just tell the court that you ate that t-bone steak during a break?Manella:
Oops! ROFL!Phoenix:
Well?Manella:
Umm...Judge:
Mr. Manella, what's this all about?Manella:
W-well, yeah, I guess we did take a little break.Mia:
Phoenix! Great job! If they took a break, one of them could have gone to the studio during that time!Phoenix:
Your Honor! I call on the witness to testify to the court about this break!Judge:
Very well. Mr. Manella, your testimony, please.Manella:
Urk!Edgeworth:
Heh heh heh...Phoenix:
(Uh oh. Edgeworth is laughing...)Witness Testimony-- The Break --Manella:
Yeah, FWIW, we took a break... ROFL!
But it was only 15 minutes! 15! That's only 13 in Base 12!
Not enough time for someone to, say, commit murder in Studio One! LOL!
That's only just enough time to eat a t-bone steak, if you ask me! *steams*Judge:
Hmm... I don't think it would even be enough time for that, but that's just me. Very well. You may begin the cross-examination.Cross Examination-- The Break --Manella:
Yeah, FWIW, we took a break... ROFL!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What time exactly did you take this break?
Manella:
Hmm... I'd say it was from around 2:30 or so until 2:45.
Phoenix:
(2:30!!! That's the time of death! So he could have gone to Studio One, killed Hammer, and come back... I guess it's possible, time-wise...)
Edgeworth:
...Manella:
But it was only 15 minutes! 15! That's only 13 in Base 12!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What were you doing for those 15 minutes?
Manella:
Eating my t-bone steak! What else!?
Phoenix:
There were two plates on the trailer table...?
Manella:
Oh, right. The other one was Diva's... sorry, Dee Vasquez's plate.
Phoenix:
(Dee Vasquez... the producer.)
Edgeworth:
To eat a t-bone steak in 15 minutes... that's quite a feat.Manella:
Not enough time for someone to, say, commit murder in Studio One! LOL!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Why is that?Press (after pressing first statement)







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Why is that?"Manella:
That's only just enough time to eat a t-bone steak, if you ask me! *steams*Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
I have to say, you look like a guy who gets through his meals pretty fast.
Manella:
Well, I was facing a cold, slightly chewy t-bone steak... Even I have to take my time eating that kind of food. LOLMia:
Well, Phoenix?Phoenix:
That testimony was too short to wring any kind of useful information out of!Mia:
All you have to do is prove that he was able to go to Studio One in that time!Phoenix:
(Oh, great. Is that all...)Phoenix:
Why is that?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
Haven't we had enough of this pointless line of questioning? Your Honor! The testimony to this point has made one certain fact painfully clear: The people in the trailer had nothing to do with this murder! It was impossible for any of them to go to Studio One!Phoenix:
What!?Edgeworth:
Something wrong, Mr. Wright? Surely you aren't suggesting one of the people in the trailer went to Studio One!Judge:
Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright?Mia:
Phoenix, this is critical! Think about it before you give your answer!Judge:
Do you claim someone from the trailer went to Studio One?I claim it, and claim it loud







Phoenix:
(If I agree to let everyone in that trailer off the hook then the trial is over... Mr. Powers will be found guilty for sure!) The victim was murdered at 2:30, the exact time of the break in the meeting. With 15 minutes, murder is certainly a possibility!
Judge:
Hmm... I suppose you might say that...
Phoenix:
(Alright, I've got the judge thinking now!)
Edgeworth:
Tsk, tsk, tsk... Never a dull moment with you, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
What's your point, Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
You've been doing your homework, haven't you? Look at the Court Record.
Phoenix:
The Court Record...?
Edgeworth:
Surely, you knew that from 2:15 to 4:00 the path between the studios was blocked? Mrs. Monkey's head had fallen across the path!
Phoenix:
Whoa! You're right!
Edgeworth:
True, the break in the trailer meeting came right at the time of death... However! The path from there to the scene of the crime was blocked! The fallen Mrs. Monkey head barred the way!
Phoenix:
... (It's actually "Mr. Monkey," but Edgeworth has a point... And somehow, I feel no desire to correct him.)
Judge:
No counter-argument, Mr. Wright? Then I'm afraid you lose this round.
Leads to:
"I believe we have seen enough evidence."No, it's impossible.







Phoenix:
(I don't want to write off so many possible suspects... But I can't keep claiming the impossible, either...) I agree that it was impossible for anyone in the trailer to go to the studio in that time.
Edgeworth:
Ha hah! I thought you might be thoughtlessly treading on thin ice again! But I see you had at least an inkling of the truth.
Judge:
What do you mean, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
It's quite simple... True, the break in the trailer meeting came right at the time of death... However! The path from there to the scene of the crime was blocked! The fallen Mrs. Monkey head barred the way! At around 2:15, a strong gust of wind knocked off the studio mascot's head. Ergo! When the people in the trailer took a break at 2:30, the way to the studio was blocked. Blocked... by Mrs. Monkey's severed head!
Phoenix:
... (It's actually "Mr. Monkey," but Edgeworth has a point... And somehow, I feel no desire to correct him.)
Leads to:
"I believe we have seen enough evidence."Edgeworth:
I believe we have seen enough evidence. I would like to relieve Mr. Manella from the stand.Phoenix:
(Wh-what? It's over?)Judge:
Very well. The court's opinion on this case is as follows: We have found that there were several other people in Studio 2 on the day of the murder. However, it is also clear that none of these people could have gone to Studio One. They therefore have no relation to this case. Furthermore, with regards to the photo of the Steel Samurai... Given the size of the costume, no one other than Mr. Powers could have worn it that day. All that is lacking is decisive evidence that he is the one who did it. If we had that, I'm afraid I would have to find Mr. Powers guilty.Edgeworth:
Your Honor. The prosecution is pleased to announce that we indeed have decisive evidence: a witness.Judge:
Who is this witness, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:
My witness saw the very moment when the Steel Samurai skewered the victim!Judge:
Order! I will have order! I see. The court will take a 10 minute recess, after which we will hear your witness. Court is adjourned for recess!October 19, 11:04 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Mia:
...Phoenix:
What do we do now, Mia? If everyone in that trailer has an alibi...Mia:
... I'm sorry, Phoenix. I guess I was wrong.Phoenix:
M-Mia! Don't tell me you're giving up! If you give up, what hope do I have...?Mia:
... Don't get me wrong. I've never given up on a trial before, not while there was a chance. Only one thing became clear in your cross-examination. The people in the trailer could not have gone to Studio One. I thought there was more to it than that... But I was wrong. That's all there is.Will:
Umm... Er... What's going to happen to me? It kinda seems like everyone in that courtroom thinks I did it... They think I'm a murderer!Mia:
Don't worry, Mr. Powers. If you are innocent, we will prove it. I guarantee it. Leave it to us, and... be yourself. Be strong. You are the Steel Samurai, hero to children everywhere, after all.Will:
I... You... Thanks. *sniff*Mia:
Okay, Phoenix. This one's for the kids! Let's do it!October 19, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:
Court is back in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:
The prosecution has a concern. As our witness is a grade schooler of tender years, and this is a murder case... we worry that the defense might cause unnecessary trauma with his cruel questioning. (Changed from [We worry that the defense might cause unnecessary trauma with his cruel questioning!] in the original release)Phoenix:
(Nice to see Edgeworth taking the moral high ground...)Edgeworth:
However, we have no choice. The prosecution calls Cody Hackins to the stand.Edgeworth:
Your Honor. Perhaps you could arrange a box for him to stand on?Judge:
Oh, r-right. Guard, please bring him a box. One of those donut crates should do.Edgeworth:
Will the witness state his name and grade in school.Cody:
...Edgeworth:
Witness!Cody:
What!? Just 'cause you're all grown-up don't mean you can push me around!Edgeworth:
Mrph...Mia:
Cody? Answer his question, okay?Cody:
H-hey, it's you! The nice lady! I'm Cody Hackins. I'm in 2nd grade!Phoenix:
(I get the feeling this is going to be a long, long day...)Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth. Please remember that you're speaking to a child. Try to be gentle.Edgeworth:
M-mrrrrph! Witness! Er, I mean, Cody.Phoenix:
(He's having trouble with this "gentle" thing.)Edgeworth:
You were present, er, you were at Global Studios on the day of the, er, incident?Cody:
You got a problem with that!?Edgeworth:
Please tell us what you saw that day.Cody:
What, pops? You want me to tell you and gramps with the beard over there?Edgeworth:
Just.. Mr. Edgeworth will be fine.Judge:
I prefer "bearded gentleman" myself.Phoenix:
(A very long day...)Judge:
Incidentally, photographic equipment is strictly forbidden in this courtroom.Edgeworth:
M-mpht! M-my apologies, Your Honor. He said he wouldn't testify if he couldn't bring it... I'd like special permission, if that's possible.Phoenix:
Wait, so you're saying you had to bargain terms with a kid... and you LOST?Cody:
Hey! I just got this new camera! Don't really know how to use it all that good yet! But I bring it with me wherever I go!Mia:
Phoenix. I wonder if he had that camera on the day of the murder... You'd better make a note of it in the Court Record.Cody's Camera added to the Court Record.Judge:
Very well, Cody. Please testify to the court about what you saw the day of the incident.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Cody:
I wanted to see a Steel Samurai rehearsal, just once.
I found a map on the Internet, and went to the studios that day.
I went through the woods off the path, so that old lady wouldn't catch me.
I was going for the studio.
I got kinda lost on the way, though. For about 30 minutes.
When I came out by the studio, there was the Steel Samurai!
It totally rocked! Right before my eyes, out came the bad guy!
Of course, the Steel Samurai took him down! Pow!
If I had my camera with me, that woulda been the time for a shot, I tell you.
Anyway, I couldn't get into the studio, so I went home.Judge:
Hmm... Very well. The defense may begin its cross-examination. But be gentle. Remember you're talking to a child. (Changed from [And, be gentle. Remember you're talking to a child.] in the original release)Cody:

2024-11-29 17:19:36 [INFO] HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2024-11-29 17:19:36 [INFO] Assistant reply: To find a contradiction in Cody's testimony, let's consider the evidence and his statements. Here's a breakdown of the situation:

1. **Cody's Testimony Breakdown:**
   - He was trying to see a rehearsal and used a map from the Internet to get there.
   - He wasn't caught by the security lady because he went through the woods.
   - He got lost for about 30 minutes.
   - Upon reaching the studio, he saw the Steel Samurai and the "bad guy."
   - He witnessed a fight where the Steel Samurai "took him down."
   - He mentioned that he couldn't take a photo because he didn't have his camera with him.

2. **Relevant Evidence:**
   - **Cody's Camera (Evidence 15):** Cody always carries his camera, though he said he didn't have it at the critical moment.
   - **"Path to Glory" (Evidence 14):** Contains photos of every victory scene in every battle the Steel Samurai has won. Cody's meticulous documentation suggests he takes photos at critical moments.

3. **Contradiction:**
   Cody claims he witnessed the pivotal moment of the Steel Samurai's victory but didn't have his camera to take a picture. This contradicts his persona as an avid fan who documents every battle, as evidenced by his detailed photo album, "Path to Glory."

4. **Evidence to Present:**
   Present Cody's Camera (Evidence 15) because it directly contradicts his statement about not having his camera. Cody’s habit of always carrying his camera undermines his claim that he didn't have it with him for the critical event, highlighting the inconsistency.

Considering Cody's testimony and the evidence, the camera he claims not to have, which he always carries, should be presented at testimony statement number 8:

```json
{
  "action": "present",
  "testimony": 8,
  "evidence": 15
}
```

**Final Answer:**
```json
{
  "action": "present",
  "testimony": 8,
  "evidence": 15
}
```

A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\" In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!August 3, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.

One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one.

Oh, Nick! I didn't know you were here!Phoenix:
Of course I'm here! What was that surreal show you were watching?Maya:
What!? Nick, you mean, you don't know the Steel Samurai!? He's only the most popular TV hero for young people!Phoenix:

Then watch it with me! He's really cool! And... it's really popular! When they asked grade school kids what they wanted to be, "Steel Samurai" was no. 1! ([no. 1] written as [no.1] in the original release)Phoenix:
I really worry about kids these days.Maya:

Now for the morning news. The actor Will Powers was arrested yesterday. Powers plays the lead role in the popular kid's show "The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo." He was arrested on suspicion of murder. The victim was Jack Hammer, who plays the villain known as the "Evil Magistrate." His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. The "Samurai Spear" was also found stuck through the body. Police believe this was the murder weapon, and are investigating further.Phoenix:
... This has to be a joke.Maya:

Bookshelf







Phoenix:
There's a horrendous amount of legal books here. Scarier still is the thought that I have to read all of these now.




Houseplant







Phoenix:
Mia's favorite potted plant. Maya has been watering it so much lately it looks a little... swollen. She's either trying to make it grow... or she's perfecting her water torture technique.




Movie poster







Phoenix:
A poster of an old movie that Mia liked. I was thinking I should go see it myself. Then I realized that the poster doesn't actually say the title of the movie.




Desk







Phoenix:
Mia's desk. Actually... it's my desk now. Sitting here always makes me feel like a professional.




Window







Phoenix:
It's a nice day outside. The hotel across the way is always full these days. There's the bellboy, happily cleaning the room.Talk









What to do







Phoenix:
Well, what should we do?
Maya:
What should we do!? How can you just sit there like that!? We have to get down to the detention center and meet the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
(Does she want to investigate this case or just do some sightseeing, I wonder? My money's on sightseeing.)




Any ideas







Maya:
We don't have enough information to make a case yet.
Phoenix:
Just admit it: you don't have a clue what happened.
Maya:
No! We just don't have enough information!Present

Phoenix:
What about this?
Maya:
You like showing that off, don't you, Nick?

What's wrong, Maya? It's him! In the flesh!Maya:
Umm... Is that guy really him?Phoenix:
Whaddya mean "that guy"? Of course it's him! Will Powers, our client! That's him.Maya:
Um, maybe I shouldn't be saying this... But he definitely did it. Murder. At least once. Maybe twice.Phoenix:
Whoa whoa whoa! What are you saying!?Will:
Umm...Maya:
Y-yes!?Will:
Something wrong...?Maya:
N-no! No!Phoenix:
(This is getting off to a great start.)Will:
I know, I know. You're disappointed, aren't you?Maya:
D-disappointed!? Oh, no. Oh no.Will:
No, it's okay. This is the real me. When I got the part of the Steel Samurai, with that mask... I decided I would never show my face in public until the job was over. It's the kids, you know. I didn't want to wreck their dreams.Maya:
Oh...Will:
I guess it didn't matter. So much for dreams. I wonder what they think of the Steel Samurai now. *sniff* Uwaaah!Maya:

Security camera







Phoenix:
Smile for the camera...




Security guard







Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He seems frozen in awe of Will Powers.Talk









What happened







Phoenix:
Maybe you could start by telling us what happened.
Will:
Y-yes. Of course. It seems like it was only yesterday. Actually, it was only yesterday. The cast had come down to Global Studios for a run-through. We went through a few action sequences at 10:00 that morning. There was a rehearsal scheduled for 5:00 in the afternoon. But when 5:00 came around, and the staff gathered at the studio... The Evil Magistrate was found lying in a crumpled heap near the set. They took off his mask... And discovered that it was Jack Hammer... dead! He had been expertly skewered with the Samurai Spear.
Phoenix:
The "Samurai Spear"...?
Will:
Yes, it's a long spear that I... that the Steel Samurai uses as a weapon.




The Steel Samurai







Phoenix:
Maybe you could explain to me just what "the Steel Samurai" is.
Maya:
Nick! How could you say such a thing? I-I'm sorry, sir, I apologize for my partner! He's new to this, and a bit OUT OF TOUCH with the world.
Phoenix:
Hey! Who's "new to this"!?
Will:
No, it's alright, really. The Steel Samurai is the lead character in a popular kid's show. He walks the streets of Neo Olde Tokyo... Fighting battle after battle against the Evil Magistrate and his minions. Of course, he never really defeats the Evil Magistrate. Although... I guess he did defeat him this time... *sniff* Uwaaah!
Phoenix:
I-I see. (Neo Olde Tokyo...? Who comes up with these names!?)




Powers's alibi (appears after "What happened")







Phoenix:
Now, where were you on the day of the murder?
Will:
Well, that morning I came to studios at 9:00. We worked through some action scenes until noon. Rehearsal was to begin at 5:00, but I was a little tired. So after lunch, I took a nap in my dressing room. When I woke up, it was after 5:00! I was late for the rehearsal! I hurried to the studio... and found everyone looking shocked. They arrested me on the spot, and brought me here.
Phoenix:
(So he was sleeping the entire afternoon of the murder? Some action hero!)
Will:
What will the kids think? *sniff*Present

Phoenix:
Um, here.
Will:
I... I see. ...
Phoenix:

Anything else







Will:
I-I'm sorry. I'm sure that's very important and all. I just don't see what it has to do with my problem.After clearing "Powers's alibi" Talk option:Phoenix:

What to do







Phoenix:
Well, what should we do?
Maya:
Sitting around here won't get us anywhere, that's for sure. The studio! We should go to the studio! I'm sure we could find some clues there!
Phoenix:

O-oh... s-sorry! W-we're, um, lawyers.Oldbag:
Oh yeah? Well that's great. I'm security! And it's my job to make sure that gawkers like you stay OUT.Maya:
G-gawkers?Oldbag:
Gawkers! Sightseers! Tourists!!! I know the type. You heard about the incident and came to snoop around. Youths today! Something horrible happens and all you can think of is sightseeing. Wasting your time at a place like this. Don't you have jobs you should be doing? Or do lawyers not work like the rest of us? Maybe I should become a lawyer too. Sounds like a life of ease to me no work just loafing around all day as you please. Well when I was young things were a mite different, mind you we didn't prance around in strange hippie clothes. What are the youths coming to these days my own son hasn't called in...Maya:
Umm... Nick? Will I grow up to be like her? Please say "no."Phoenix:
I dunno! It's possible.Oldbag:
Hey! Listen when you're being spoken to! Youths today!Examine









Computer







Phoenix:
The computer that runs the studio security cameras.
Oldbag:
Hey! No touching!




Guard station







Phoenix:
The security guard station. That security lady must like junk food. There's a mountain of it on the desk in there. I can see the computer that runs the security cameras.




Main gate







Phoenix:
The main entrance to the studio. There was a big scene here yesterday with onlookers pressing up against the gate.




Studio map







Phoenix:
An overhead map of the studios. Right from here is the Employee Area. To the left are the actual film studios.




Studio van







Phoenix:
Looks like a studio van. They probably use it to carry around film equipment.Talk









The studios







Phoenix:
So, what do you do here at the studios?
Oldbag:
At Global Studios, we make children's dreams come true! In fact, in my younger days...
Maya:
No! You were a star!?
Oldbag:
Only a little twinkle between the stars here, I'm afraid, dearie.
Maya:
Wo... wow.
Oldbag:
This place has really gone downhill, you know? But 10 years ago, now that was a studio of dreams! Hammer was a big star back then too, he was...
Phoenix:
Hammer...?
Oldbag:
The victim, dummy! The Evil Magistrate! He's been reduced to playing villains now. Not exactly the best material to work with...




Will Powers







Phoenix:
Can you tell me about Mr. Will Powers?
Oldbag:
He's not a bad kid, but don't be fooled by his mask! You wouldn't want him on the silver screen without it, believe me. Little old ladies watching would lose their lunch! That's probably why he thought that the Steel Samurai was his "big chance." No one thought he was capable of doing what he did to poor Jack Hammer...
Maya:
We don't know for certain that Will Powers is guilty!
Oldbag:
Powers? Of course he's guilty! How do I know? I know everything! That's my job.




Mr. Hammer (appears after "The studios")







Phoenix:
What kind of person was Jack Hammer?
Oldbag:
What "kind of person"? Oh... if you only knew! Jack Hammer will live on in many hearts as the ultimate action hero! He was simply dashing in the Dynamite Samurai series!
Phoenix:
(Should I have heard of that...?)
Oldbag:
But... there was an accident during filming five years ago. He got an unlucky break after that. Reduced to playing the villain on a children's program! What's more, I heard they were paying him peanuts. It's enough to make you cry.




Reason for suspicion (appears after "Will Powers")







Phoenix:
Why are you so certain Mr. Powers is the killer?
Oldbag:
I was standing right here yesterday, I was. I was here from 1:00 in the afternoon, to 5:00, when they found the body! Now the studio where the murder took place is to the left here. So if you want to go to the studio, you have to pass by me! Only one person went by here between 1:00 and 2:30, when the murder took place!
Phoenix:
And... that person was Mr. Powers?
Oldbag:
Yes. I saw him!
Phoenix:
But Mr. Powers says he was sleeping in his dressing room.
Oldbag:
Oh, I'm sure he would say that. He's no fool! But he was the only one that walked by. He's the killer, you can bet your biscuits on it.Present









Anything







Oldbag:
What's that? You giving that to me?
Phoenix:

Hello! How was the studio? They all think I did it, don't they?Maya:
N-no, not at all! Isn't that right, Nick?Phoenix:
Right, not at all. At worst, you're a suspect.Will:
*sniff*Talk









Your alibi







Phoenix:
Mr. Powers, you aren't hiding anything from me, are you?
Will:
W-what? No! I'd never do that!
Phoenix:
Just now you said that you were sleeping in your dressing room after lunch.
Will:
Yes. Like a baby.
Phoenix:
But the security lady said she saw you that day. She says she saw you heading towards the scene of the crime!
Will:
W-what!? That's not possible! I... I really don't know what to say! I was sleeping, I promise!
Phoenix:
Mr. Powers, if you want me to help you, you have to tell me the truth. I'm new to this lawyer business, and I need every advantage I can get.
Will:
I know... I-I'm sorry. *sniff* But, I swear to you on my momma's grave, I was sleeping. Maybe the security lady only thought she saw me?
Phoenix:
(What did she see...? He doesn't seem to be lying.)




The security lady







Phoenix:
Umm... about the security guard at the main gate to the studio...
Will:
Oh, the security lady?
Maya:
She's terrible! She called me "suspicious lookin'"!
Will:
Y-yes... actually, she's said the same thing to me before. "Take off that mask!" were her words, I believe. She sucks up to all the bigwigs at the studio... But let her see you stumble once and she'll never let up on you.
Maya:
Grr! She's got some nerve!
Phoenix:
Do you think you could write up a letter formally requesting my representation?
Will:
Of c-course.
Powers's Request added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:
(I just hope this will get me past that security lady.)

Bench







Phoenix:
I'm a little bushed. Maybe I'll take a short rest here.

Hey, good idea, pal!
Maya:
Detective! Aren't you on the case?
Gumshoe:
W-well, yeah, but... Hey, us detectives get tired of standing around too, pal!




Left path







Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe, what's down the path to the left? It looks like a tree fell down over the path...?
Gumshoe:
Oh, yeah. That way's kind of dangerous. You should stay out, pal. There's nothing down there, anyway. That's where Studio Two used to be, they tell me. They don't use it now, though.




Statue with broken head







Phoenix:
The studio mascot. I guess it's a monkey of some kind. But what kind of monkey has a nose like that? He's holding a sign in his hand. [Right: To Studio One; Left: To Studio Two]
Maya:
What's up with that thing!? It looks kind of... busted.
Gumshoe:
Oh, the wind was pretty strong yesterday, and the head broke off. It took that tree down with it, too.




Security camera







Phoenix:
Hey, there's a camera here.
Gumshoe:
That's the security camera. It takes photos of people going to the studio. All you have to do is look at the data and you can see who went where!
Phoenix:
There's a number plate on the camera... [ST1-307]. That must be the camera ID number.




Studio One entrance







Phoenix:
The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.
Maya:
Let's go in and check it out, Nick! ... Hey! It's locked!
Phoenix:
Looks like you need a cardkey to get in. It makes sense that they would want to keep the non-employees out.

There's a big welcome sign above the path.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, apparently the studio's fallen on tough times. They've started letting people in on days they aren't filming. They make a bit of extra money by charging for admission.
Maya:
Huh. You sure know a lot about this place, Detective. You know, you could always quit being a detective and work here?
Phoenix:
Yeah! And what perfect timing, with the monkey's neck broken and all.
Gumshoe:
Huh? Just what's that supposed to mean, pal!?Talk









The investigation







Phoenix:
So, how is your investigation going, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Well, it's... Hey! I can't tell you that, pal.
Maya:
Nick... Maybe you need to be a little more indirect with your questions?
Phoenix:
Right. So, Detective, mind if I take a look at what you got?
Gumshoe:
What I got?
Phoenix:
The autopsy report! The latest version, if you please...
Gumshoe:
Hmm... right, right. Sorry about what happened last time, pal.
Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.




The investigation (subsequent times)







Phoenix:
So, how is your investigation going, Detective?
Gumshoe:
I'm not at liberty to give you any more information, pal. You'll hear all you need to know in court!
Phoenix:
(Oh well, it was worth a try.)




Reason for arrest







Phoenix:
Why was Mr. Powers arrested?
Gumshoe:
Simple, pal! The murder took place right over there in Studio One. Now, the victim entered Studio One at approximately 1:00 PM. At that time, there was no one other than the victim in the studio. According to the autopsy report, the time of death was 2:30 PM. Only one person went to the studio between 1:00 and 2:30! And that person was none other than Will Powers! No one else, pal! If you think I'm lying, ask the security lady at the main gate.
Maya:
Nick! If that's true...! Anyone would think that Powers did it with that kind of evidence!
Phoenix:
Thanks for cheering me up...




The security lady







Phoenix:
About the security lady...
Gumshoe:
Oh, that sweet old lady. What a charmer!
Phoenix:
Huh? A-are we talking about the same person?
Gumshoe:
When I showed her my badge she gave me a donut and some coffee!
Maya:
Remember what Powers said. She's a sucker for authority.
Gumshoe:
She even gave me a piece of valuable evidence!
Maya:
Whaat!?




Decisive evidence (appears after "The security lady")







Phoenix:
What kind of evidence!?
Gumshoe:
Well, that, er, photo. The photo of the Steel Samurai heading toward the scene of the crime!
Maya:
What! Who took that!?
Gumshoe:
See the camera up on that gate, pal?
Maya:
The gate? You mean the one with the welcome sign?
Gumshoe:
Yeah. Whenever someone walks by, that camera automatically snaps a photo of them!
Maya:
Oh no! Nick, he has evidence! We're finished!
Phoenix:
(Funny, for someone with hard proof he doesn't look too happy.)
Gumshoe:
...Present









Attorney's Badge







Phoenix:
Detective, see this? This is my attorney's badge.
Gumshoe:
Uh huh? Don'tcha think it's a little sad when you have to explain what your badge means, pal? Real men show their P.D. badge and that's that!
Phoenix:
I'll admit the design of my badge leaves a lot to be desired...
Maya:
Maybe it should just be a big "L" for "Lawyer"?
Phoenix:
Hmm... I'm not so sure about that.




Anything else







Phoenix:
Um, Detective. Any ideas about this?
Gumshoe:
Look, I don't got time to look at every little trinket you got, okay pal?After clearing "The investigation" and "Decisive evidence" Talk options:Gumshoe:
What's wrong, pal? You seem down.Phoenix:
Don't look so happy when you say that.Gumshoe:
Oh hoh hoh hoh hoh!Maya:
Umm... We'd like to ask the employees here some questions...Gumshoe:
Sure thing, pal. Go wherever you like. Of course, you're not going to find any clues I haven't already found! Hah hah hah!Phoenix:
(I'm glad someone around here seems to be enjoying themselves.)Maya:
Nick, let's go! We've got a free pass to the place. Now's our chance to check things out!Studio - Main GateMaya:
Nick! Look! That security lady is in the guard station stuffing her face with donuts! I guess all cops like their donuts!Phoenix:
Yeah, and they're soft enough she doesn't need teeth to chew them...Oldbag:
Hey, you! Well? Are you satisfied Powers is guilty yet?Phoenix:
(Urk! She had to make my life harder by giving that photo to Detective Gumshoe...)Talk









Photographic proof







Phoenix:
Why didn't you tell us about the security photo, ma'am?
Oldbag:
Hmm? Oh, that? I just thought it would be more thrilling to talk with the detective himself! These things are important, you know. Oh, just to the left from here is the gate with the camera that took that photo. It's my job to check the photos every day, you see.




Reason for suspicion







Oldbag:
This guard station is in a central position. No matter where you go here, you pass by my station first! Now poor Hammer, he went to the studio just before 1:00. The murder happened right around 2:30, see? The only one I seen go through here between 1:00 and 2:30 was Powers himself! The security camera got a good look at him too. If he's not the one what did it, I don't know who is!
Phoenix:
Maybe... it was you?
Oldbag:
Gyah hah ha hah! Good one, sonny.
Phoenix:
(She thinks I was joking.)




Mr. Hammer







Phoenix:
Was the victim, Mr. Hammer, a popular actor?
Oldbag:
Oh, he was the biggest star in the studio!
Phoenix:
("Was"? Past tense?)
Maya:
Oh yes! He was great as the "Bearded Samurai"!
Oldbag:
That too, yes. He shone the brightest! Back in the day. Making a star like him play the "Evil Magistrate"... It's a disgrace, I tell you! Hammer took it pretty hard, and who can blame him?




Automatic camera (appears after "Photographic proof")







Phoenix:
About the security camera...
Oldbag:
Oh yes, the camera. It's automatic. It can tell when someone walks through that gate, see? Then it snaps a photo! Apparently, it records the time when it takes a picture too. But I don't bother myself with those details. I just view all the photos on the computer over in the security guard station. I check 'em every day before going home, I do.October 16Wright & Co. Law OfficesMaya:
What's going on, Nick!? Powers said he was sleeping in his dressing room! But now there's a photo of him going to the studio!?Phoenix:
Don't look at me! How should I know?Talk









What to do







Phoenix:
What do you think?
Maya:
That photo the detective was talking about is the problem here.
Phoenix:
Well, that's hard to say, without seeing the actual photo ourselves. But if it is Powers in that photo, his alibi is shot.




Photographic proof







Phoenix:
Only one person went to the scene of the crime before the murder took place. And there's a photograph to prove it.
Maya:
I guess it makes sense that that person is the killer then. What do we do, Nick?
Phoenix:
Maybe there was someone else who could have gone to the scene other than Powers? Let's take a look. Maybe that security lady missed someone?
Maya:
On thing's for sure, if there are any clues, they'll be in that studio.October 16Detention CenterVisitor's RoomPhoenix:
...Maya:
Apparently they have Mr. Powers in questioning.Phoenix:
Hmm... right.Gumshoe:
Look pal, that camera takes a picture automatically whenever someone walks by. And it took a picture of Will Powers!Phoenix:
I have to ask him about that photograph!Maya:
Oh well. Let's try again later.Examine









Security guard







Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He must get pretty bored. I bet he's making funny faces at that camera.October 16Global StudiosEmployee AreaMaya:
Nick! This is where they do all the behind-the-scenes stuff! Hey! Look! There's Powers's dressing room! No one's here this soon after the murder I guess. Let's take a look around!Examine









Bicycle







Phoenix:
Looks like one of those electric-powered bicycles. I dunno about these. I mean, what's the point?
Maya:
It makes it a lot easier to go up hills!
Phoenix:
Don't people cycle to get exercise!?




Drain grate







Phoenix:
The metal grate on the drain here has been taken off. That's a pretty big drain. A kid could fit through there, I bet.
Maya:
Yeah, if you snuck in that way you wouldn't have to pay at the gate!
Phoenix:
Well, if you want to leave that way, be my guest.
Maya:
Right! Huh? Hey! I'm not a kid!




Grate







Phoenix:
The grate that used to cover the drain. It's a little bent. I don't think it would fit if I tried to put it back on.




Lunch table







Phoenix:
The remains of yesterday's lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak.
Maya:
Mmm! T-bone steak! That would have hit the spot.
Phoenix:
You just had a burger!
Maya:
Yeah, but I have a second stomach just for steaks.
Phoenix:
(What!?)




Stage backdrop







Phoenix:
There's a half-finished backdrop for a stage here. Looks like a castle. Probably "Neo Olde Tokyo Castle."




Dressing room door







Phoenix:
The door to the dressing room. It's not locked.
Maya:
Hey, Nick! Let's take a look inside! Maybe we can find something as a souvenir...?
Phoenix:
What do you mean "find"!?
Maya:
You never know! There might be something like... the Samurai Spear!
Phoenix:
We don't need a spear! (And that's the murder weapon for crying out loud!)




Dressing room sign







Phoenix:
There's a sign on the dressing room door. "Mr. Will Powers"... it must be neat to be the star and have your own room like this.




Dressing room window







Phoenix:
A window into the dressing room. The glass is frosted, so I can't see inside.




Storage room door







Phoenix:
That must be the storage room. That's where they keep all the film equipment.
Maya:
Wow, Nick! You know a lot about the industry!
Phoenix:
Umm, what else would they keep in a film studio?




Vending machine







Phoenix:
Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks or something. Popcorn, at least!
Maya:
W-wait! Look! "Samurai Soda"! Nick! Try this!
Phoenix:

(Powers's dressing room... So this is where he was sleeping? Or at least, this is where he claims he was sleeping.)Maya:
No one actually saw him taking a nap here, did they?Phoenix:
Right, and there's a picture of him near the crime scene. (I hope he's telling the truth... for his sake!)Examine









Cosmetics







Phoenix:
There's a vast array of cosmetics here.
Maya:
Ooh! This is the wig he used in "Samurai Boogey-Woogey"! Nick! Try this on!
Phoenix:
No. And how can you tell the name of a show just by looking at a wig!?
Maya:
I, um, kinda like samurai movies.
Phoenix:
("Kinda"...?)




Costume rack







Phoenix:
There's some regular suits in among the costumes here. Those must be his own clothes.
Maya:
It'd be fun to wear one of the costumes...
Phoenix:
(I'd say you were already wearing one, myself.)




Couch







Phoenix:
Looks like someone was sleeping here. Maybe Powers did take a nap here yesterday...




Mirror







Phoenix:
They always have mirrors like this in dressing rooms. I see my hair is still nice and spiky, just how I like it.




Bag







Maya:
Hmm? This must be Powers's bag.
Phoenix:
Hey, don't open that.
Maya:
Look!
Phoenix:
An employee cardkey. That must be Powers's. It says "Studio One."
Maya:
Let's take it, Nick!
Phoenix:
Borrow it. You mean borrow.
Cardkey added to the Court Record.




Bag (subsequent times)







Maya:
I wonder what else is inside Powers's bag...?
Phoenix:
Stop that! (My partner, the thief in training.)




Table







Phoenix:
There's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Some tea and cookies...
Maya:
Nick... I'm hungry!
Phoenix:
You just had a burger!
Maya:
Yeah, but I have a separate stomach for sweets!
Phoenix:
(How many stomachs does this girl have!?)

Phoenix:
It's locked. Looks like he doesn't open his window much. I guess it is kind of dusty outside.Wright & Co. Law OfficesPresent

Cardkey







Phoenix:
Could you tell me about this, ma'am?
Oldbag:
Oh that! Isn't that a studio cardkey? You better watch it! The scene of a murder is no place for sightseeing! I'll be taking that! Hand it over!
Phoenix:
W-wait! No, that's mine!

Look, I don't have a cardkey to the studio, see? I want to go pay my respects to Jack Hammer where he died.

Studio One entrance







Phoenix:
The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.

Doesn't it give you the shivers, Nick? That white tape! It's so... so real!Phoenix:
Well, the Evil Magistrate did die here. And the Steel Samurai killed him. The murder weapon was the Samurai Spear. Sounds pretty real to me...Examine









Director's chair







Maya:
Hey! Look! That's the chair the director sits in! I've always wanted to sit in one of these. Hey Nick, take a look at that. One of those black-and-white boards they clap at the start of filming! And look! A megaphone! A real live megaphone!
Phoenix:

Maya:
Ready, Nick? Action!

(This girl is more troubled than I thought...)




Film camera







Leads to:
"Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!"




Reflecting screen







Maya:
What's this?
Phoenix:
That's for reflecting light. They call it a reflecting screen or something like that. The assistant holds it during filming.
Maya:
Huh.
Phoenix:
What? Where's your enthusiasm for all things entertainment?
Maya:
Well, lighting is fine, but I'd want to be the director. Or maybe the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
(I think she's being serious...!)




Stage backdrop







Phoenix:
Looks like a backdrop for a stage. This must be used in the Steel Samurai show.
Maya:
Of course! That's the mountain, Neo Fujiyama!
Phoenix:
Doesn't the Steel Samurai take place in Olde Tokyo? Can you even see Mt. Fuji from there?
Maya:
Not Olde Tokyo, Nick! "Neo" Olde Tokyo!
Phoenix:
Oh. Right.




(Step)ladder







Maya:
Look, a ladder!
Phoenix:
That's a "step"-ladder.
Maya:
So? What's the difference? You need to stop judging things based on narrow-minded cultural assumptions, Nick!
Phoenix:
R-right... sorry. (This girl is OUT there!)




Tape outline







Phoenix:
They outlined where Jack Hammer's body lay with tape. His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. I guess that's why the head part looks like a helmet. Funny, I expected a spear stabbing would leave at least a few bloodstains. I guess the costume must have absorbed most of it...Maya:
Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!Phoenix:
Yeah! So don't touch it!Maya:
Whoa! It's heavier than I thought...???:
Hey! You! No touching that!Phoenix:
Ah, um, sorry, my partner is kind of, y'know...Maya:
"Y'know"!? No I don't know!Phoenix:

We're lawyers representing Mr. Will Powers.Penny:
Oh, you're WP's people.Maya:
"WP"...? Oh, Will Powers. W.P., I get it.Penny:
I don't envy you guys one bit! But... do what you can for WP, okay? He'd never hurt a fly! He has to be innocent.Maya:
Don't worry, leave it to us!Talk









The day of the crime







Phoenix:
Could you tell me anything about the day of the murder?
Penny:
Yes. I was in the studio the whole day. I was the only assistant on staff that day, you see.
Maya:
Only one assistant!?
Penny:
Yes, well, the studios isn't doing so well right now. (Changed from [Yes, well, the studios aren't doing so well right now.] in the original release) And yesterday was only rehearsal for our action sequences.
Maya:
Oh, I see. (Changed from [I see. Neat!] in the original release)
Penny:
In the morning we went through the action sequences in the employee area. WP and Hammer were there, along with everyone else.
Phoenix:
The employee area--that's where Powers's dressing room is, right?
Penny:
Yes, that's the place. After eating lunch there, Mr. Hammer went to Studio One. Then I saw WP go into his dressing room. But I didn't see either of them after that.




Will Powers







Phoenix:
Did you know that Mr. Powers was sleeping in his room?
Penny:
No! I wouldn't go in there unless I had some urgent message for him... I mean, it's his private... What kind of a girl do you think I am!?
Phoenix:
W-what kind...? No, no, I'm sure you're a fine girl. Um, sorry. (So much for getting a confirmation of Powers's alibi.)Present









Anything







Phoenix:
Um, any thoughts about this?
Penny:
Sorry... I... don't really want to think too much about what happened just yet.After clearing all Talk options:Maya:
What do we do, Nick? We haven't found anything. If WP was the only one who came to the studio... Then he has to be the killer! They even have a photograph...Phoenix:

Not really.Penny:
Actually, there's been something bothering me.Maya:
Ah hah! That's what I'm talking about! A clue! A lead!Penny:
Well, I don't know about that, but that day, just after noon, I sensed someone was here...Phoenix:
You "sensed"?Penny:
Yes, several times.Phoenix:
Some other studio employees, maybe?Penny:
No, I don't think so. The only thing we had scheduled was an action scene run-through. I was the only assistant here that day. I have a feeling it was someone from... outside.Phoenix:
R-really!?Maya:
But wait, if someone had come in here... Wouldn't that security lady have noticed them?Phoenix:
Yeah, you're right.Penny:
I'm sorry I don't have any better information than that.Maya:
No, thanks! That helps us a lot. Anything helps. Let's go put that security lady on the spot!Talk









Sensing someone







Phoenix:
So you sensed that someone other than the regular film crew was in the studio?
Penny:
Yes... I think.

What? I saw that suspicious look on your face!Phoenix:
I wanted to ask you again about yesterday... You came here at 1:00 PM, correct? And the estimated time of Hammer's death was 2:30. Are you sure that Powers was the only one to go through here between those times?Oldbag:
Sure as can be!Maya:
But we have a witness who thinks there was "someone from outside" here that day.Oldbag:
What!?Maya:
Are you absolutely sure you were here watching the whole time?Oldbag:

Ma'am?Oldbag:
Who was it? Who told you that? Who dares question ME!?Maya:
Eek!Oldbag:
Alright you better tell me and tell me quick, you spiky-haired cretin! Someone's been complaining about the work I do, eh!?Maya:
Uh... um, we were just talking to the assistant in Studio One.Oldbag:
Her! She's not even a full-time employee! All you young'uns are like that nowadays, running your mouths like there was no tomorrow saying this that and the other thing. Well when I was young let me tell you we knew a thing or two about respecting our elders. Back then we did and it's a crying shame that you youths today just say what you please about poor old ladies Graaaaaaaaaaaawr!Phoenix:

Well, Nick? This is our chance to do what we can without her looking over our shoulders!Examine









Computer







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Yeah, maybe. (Should I try the computer?)



Try it







Phoenix:
Okay. Let's give it a try.
Maya:
You know how to work these things, Nick?
Phoenix:
Looks like I just have to enter in a few numbers. Let's see... first, I need the date of the murder. (It looks like the camera turned on at 1:00 PM that day... 1:00... That was when the security lady arrived at the guard station.)

Why not?Phoenix:

Hey! Why do I have to be the villain.Maya:
Relax, it was just a joke! So, are we done for today?Phoenix:

Part 6October 18, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:
Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth:
The prosecution will show the court that at 2:30 PM on October 15, the defendant, Mr. Will Powers, killed fellow actor Jack Hammer at Studio One of Global Studios. It is impossible for anyone else to have committed this heinous crime. The evidence presented during the trial will all point to this fact.Judge:
Hmm. I see. Very well, I would like to move on to your testimony. Mr. Edgeworth, the prosecution may call its first witness.Edgeworth:
Very well, I call a most familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand. (Changed from [First, I would like to call a familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand.] in the original release)Edgeworth:
Detective, if you would briefly describe this case to the court?Gumshoe:
Yes sir! I'll explain with the guidemap here. To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see? This here is the Employee Area. The actors did a run-through of their action scenes during the morning here. This is the main gate to the studios. The security lady that works at the studios was here at 1:00 PM on that day. Past the security station there is a gate, see? Past that are the studios. And here it is... Studio One. This is the scene of the murder, where the body was found! Now, on the day of the murder, October 15, there were only three people here. The victim, Jack Hammer, the defendant, Will Powers, and a young woman, the production assistant. All the production staff were in the Employee Area until noon. Then after lunch, the victim, Jack Hammer, went to Studio One. Right after that, at 1:00 PM, the security lady got to the guard station. Now, jump ahead to later that day... 5:00 PM. The production staff came to Studio One to perform a rehearsal. Needless to say, the rehearsal was cancelled... The time of death was 2:30 PM. The "Samurai Spear" found lodged in the victim's chest was the murder weapon. That's the case, in brief. Anyone like to hear that again?Phoenix:
(Hmm... should I listen to that whole thing again...?)Skip it







Leads to:
"I think I can probably remember that..."Listen again







Phoenix:
I'm sorry, could you describe that one more time?
Gumshoe:
I shoulda known it would be you, pal! Fine. Once more for the mentally-challenged lawyer.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, yeah. Live it up while you can, Gumshoe.)
Leads back to:
"To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see?"Phoenix:
(I think I can probably remember that...)Judge:
So the murder weapon was a "spear"? How... medieval!Samurai Spear added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:
Your Honor. This case is quite simple if you ask one question: And that question is: "What did the security lady at the guard station see?"Judge:
Understood.Edgeworth:
Let's call this security officer to the stand!Edgeworth:
Will the witness declare her name?Oldbag:
... Hmm? My, aren't you a handsome fellow! I'm afraid I'm a bit flustered!Edgeworth:
Y-your name, please!Oldbag:
Oh, dearie! No need for you to be embarrassed! Just call me "grandma."Edgeworth:
YOUR NAME, PLEASE!Phoenix:
(Seems Edgeworth has a bit of trouble getting his witnesses to say their names...)Oldbag:
Wendy Oldbag, dearie. So just call me "grandma." It's practically my name! So even when I was young I was an Oldbag, but not really that was just my name dearie. Still how the other children would make fun of me and just because of my name can you believe it? But there was this boy, the captain of the chess club in junior high, and when he called me an old bag well I just cried and cried because I had a crush on him you see--Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
O-objection! I... object to the witness's talkativeness.Judge:
Objection sustained! The witness will refrain from rambling on the stand.Oldbag:
I was just getting to the good part, dearie!Edgeworth:
Perhaps we can get to the testimony?Judge:
Now, the witness was stationed at the main gate on the day of the murder, correct?Oldbag:
Yessey I was.Judge:
And to get to the scene of the murder, someone would have to pass by you?Oldbag:
You know your stuff, dearie!Judge:
... You may begin your testimony.Phoenix:
(She sure is one hell of an Oldbag...)Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Oldbag:
On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.
Poor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.
I, well, I had some errands to run that morning.
Anyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.
I was at the main gate from then until 5:00!
Now, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?
Interesting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.
It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!Judge:
You saw the defendant, then? Hmm... Very well. Let's begin the cross-examination. Mr. Wright?Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So up until that time, anyone who wanted to could go into the studio?
Oldbag:
Well, there wasn't a security guard at the gate, no. But the main gate was locked, dearie. You'd need an employee cardkey to get in.
Phoenix:
(Right... the cardkey that I have. So, what she's saying is no one who wasn't supposed to be there could get in.)
Edgeworth:
Was there anyone at the studios when you arrived at the guard station?Oldbag:
Poor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
A "run-through"...?
Oldbag:
They were working out a scene between the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate. They got the basics figured out by noon, and were to use the afternoon for practice. Rehearsal was supposed to start at 5:00. That's why poor old Hammer went to Studio One in the afternoon.
Phoenix:
(So Powers was in his dressing room sleeping... when he was supposed to be practicing! Talk about a laid-back hero...)
Edgeworth:
If there was a run-through in the morning, why did you only get there after noon?Oldbag:
I, well, I had some errands to run that morning.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What kind of "errands"?
Oldbag:
Oh, well, you know.
Phoenix:
Answer the question!
Oldbag:
Actually... I was watching poor Hammer and Powers. Observing, you know?
Phoenix:
O-observing? Weren't you supposed to be at the guard station?
Oldbag:
Whippersnapper! I told you I locked the gate, didn't I? I did my job!
Phoenix:
(I'm not sure your boss would see it that way...)
Oldbag:
Anyway! I always watch Hammer's run-throughts. Always! Never missed one in all my years.

Wow! I want to see a Steel Samurai run-through too!

None other than the Steel Samurai, defender of Neo Olde Tokyo. Ms. Oldbag! Is this the "Mr. Powers" that you saw!?Oldbag:
Of course! Didn't your momma teach you any sense, sonny? Anyone can plainly see that's Powers! Right?Edgeworth:

Phoenix:
Hold it right there! We keep talking possibilities, but we have to agree that this photo shows the Steel Samurai! Nowhere in this photo can we see Mr. Will Powers!

The prosecution's thoughts are simple. Nothing has changed. The other person who went to the studios was a boy of roughly 10 years of age. The photo we do have may not be hard evidence... But there is still no one else that could have committed this crime! I call for a verdict of "guilty" for the defendant, Mr. Will Powers!Judge:

The defense disagrees with the prosecution's claim. There IS another person who could have committed this crime!Judge:

(Right. Great. As if the stakes weren't high enough.)Judge:
So, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder?The assistant girl







Phoenix:
It was the assistant! The Steel Samurai costume was in his dressing room. She stole it, and in doing so she became the Steel Samurai!
Judge:
So you're saying the Steel Samurai in the picture is really the assistant?
Phoenix:
That's correct, Your Honor!

If you're serious, you've got guts, Mr. Wright. Remember the photo? Wasn't the Steel Samurai a little lame!? He was dragging his foot!

What about the assistant?
Oldbag:
Oh, her? She was cleaning up backdrops, I think. She didn't know about Powers's ankle.

W-what!? Whippersnapper!Judge:

Ms. Oldbag was standing guard alone at the main gate. She was by herself... in other words, she has no alibi! She could have briefly left her post to steal the the Steel Samurai costume... Then slipped into Studio One, the scene of the murder!Judge:
W-why would she go through the trouble of wearing the Steel Samurai costume!?Phoenix:
Simple, Your Honor. She knew the camera at the gate would take her picture. If she was in his costume, she could point the finger at Mr. Powers!Judge:
I see! Excellent deductive reasoning, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:

Hmm... It's true that the witness could conceivably have committed this crime. Yet we must not forget that the victim was an action hero. As formidable as her personality may be, I doubt she'd be strong enough.
Phoenix:
(Uh oh! If he removes her from consideration, that means Mr. Powers is it! Sorry, windbag... but I don't have a choice.)
Leads to:
"The very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case..."Phoenix:
The very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case... can be used to cast doubt on Ms. Oldbag's actions on that day!Oldbag:
B-but why would I do something so horrible to poor Hammer!?Phoenix:
You forget that Mr. Powers lacks a clear motive, too.Judge:
Hmm... Indeed.Phoenix:
(That did it. Now windbag is one of the suspects. No hard feelings... I hope.)Oldbag:
Wait just a minute! What about the other person who went to the studio!? The boy! The one whose photo I erased!Judge:
He's only a grade schooler though, as you said. 2nd or 3rd grade, was it?Oldbag:
Th-that doesn't matter! When I was that age, I could pin my old man in 10 seconds, tops!Judge:
Hmm... Your thoughts, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:
That boy is not the killer.Oldbag:
What!? How can you be so sure! Oh, or is it be nice to the kids and mean to your elders day? Whippersnapper!Phoenix:
I have proof.Oldbag:
P-proof!?Judge:
Indeed? Then let's see this proof, Mr. Wright. You have proof that shows the boy could not have committed this murder?Present Cardkey







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
The scene of the murder, as we all know, was Studio One. However, you need a cardkey to enter Studio One! How could a boy with no formal relation to the studios have a cardkey!?
Leads to:
"I see!"Present Powers's(?) Photo or Samurai Spear







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Your Honor! The murder weapon was the Samurai Spear. That very spear is shown here in this photo. How could the boy have taken the spear? It's impossible!
Leads to:
"I see!"Present anything else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
This is my proof!
Judge:
... I can't see how that has anything to do with this matter, Mr. Wright? Mr. Wright. There aren't that many pieces of evidence in the Court Record. Please try not to pick the wrong ones!
Phoenix:
S-sorry, Your Honor.
Judge:
I'll ask again, Mr. Wright.
Leads back to:
"You have proof that shows the boy could not have committed this murder?"Judge:
I see! Well, would the witness care to comment on this?Oldbag:
Mrph.Phoenix:
(The windbag... speechless. This has got to be a first.)Judge:
Very well! This court will suspend proceedings on the current trial for today. Mr. Edgeworth, please find out more about your witness, Ms. Windy... what was her name?Edgeworth:
Something "Oldbag," Your Honor.Judge:
Then the prosecution will look further into this Oldbag before we continue! That is all. The court is adjourned!Oldbag:
W-wait a second! I'm not going to just sit here while you run off barking up the wrong tree... me! I'm talking!Maya:
Oh, great, stop the presses! The windbag wants to talk!Judge:
Ms. Oldbag! What is this all about? Have you omitted something from your testimony?Oldbag:
Actually, if you must know, there's something I was told not to talk about.Phoenix:
N-not to talk about?Edgeworth:
By whom!?Phoenix:
(Huh? You mean it wasn't Edgeworth who told her not to talk...?)Judge:
W-well, testify!Witness Testimony-- My Lips Were Sealed --Oldbag:
Global Studios wanted me to keep quiet about something.
There were... some other people at the studios on the day of the murder.
They said they had "nothing to do with it," see?
So they told me to just pretend they "hadn't been at the studios that day."
But if you're going to go accusing me, I'm not letting them get away scot free!Judge:
M-Ms. Oldbag! This is crucial information! Why did you keep this from the court until now!?Oldbag:
Ain't you been listening? They told me to shut my trap, and I always do what I'm told.Judge:

Oldbag:

We should have known something was fishy! How could they have done a run-through of their action scene without a director? Of course!
Oldbag:
Yes, well, I was surprised no one asked about it.
Phoenix:
So, where were these people?
Oldbag:
The director was in the Employee Area all morning for the run-through. He joined the producer around lunchtime and they had a meeting after that.
Edgeworth:
Where!
Oldbag:
Oh, in the Studio Two trailer.
Phoenix:
S-Studio Two...!? (There was a Studio Two...?)

Your Honor. We have learned there were others at Global Studios on the day in question. The director and the producer and, er, some bigwigs, were all present. Yet, as we stand here, they have not been questioned! I hold that it is impossible to declare a verdict on the defendant, Mr. Powers!Judge:
Hmm... The court acknowledges the defense's point. The prosecution will gather more information about the witness, Ms. Oldbag... and more information about these other people we have just been told of!Edgeworth:

We'll be going down to the studios to do some more investigation. We have to find out more about this director and producer. They'll be turning up in the next trial as witnesses for certain. So now's my chance to get material for the cross-examination!Maya:
So, Nick... Have we figured out just who it was in that Steel Samurai costume? Could it really have been old windbag?Phoenix:
What do you think, Mr. Powers?Will:
I don't think it was her, really.Maya:
Neither do I, Nick.Phoenix:
Y-yeah, I know! Look, I was just buying time back there. Someone had to be the bad guy for a bit to take the pressure off Mr. Powers.Maya:

Judge:
That's enough! This court see no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for mis-interpretation of the facts.

Whew, what a day.Maya:
This is no time for relaxing, Nick! Say, you think WP's got a chance?Phoenix:
I guess that really depends on the people we found out about in today's trial.Maya:
The director and producer...?Phoenix:
Yeah, them.Maya:
Well, what are we doing here then!? Let's get to the studios!Talk









What to do







Phoenix:
What do you think we should do?
Maya:
W-what do I... huh!? Why don't we do what you just said!? We gotta get the scoop on this director and producer.
Phoenix:
Oh, right. Then there's no point hanging out here.
Maya:
That's what I've been saying! Let's get to those studios pronto!




Any ideas







Maya:
Hmm. We don't have enough information to make a case yet.
Phoenix:
That's exactly the same thing you said yesterday! Just admit it: you don't have a clue what happened.
Maya:
There's not enough information!Present









Attorney's Badge







Phoenix:
Hey, see this?
Maya:
You... really like showing that off, don't you, Nick?




Cardkey







Maya:
Hey, you still have that! Great!
Phoenix:
Well, we couldn't get into the scene of the murder without it. And its owner isn't missing it in his detention cell...
Maya:
Poor old WP...




Powers's(?) Photo







Maya:
You know, what if this really was Mr. Powers?
Phoenix:
Yeah. It's hard to say. We don't really know anyone else it could be. I seriously doubt it was that old windbag.
Maya:
So Mr. Powers is... lying?
Phoenix:
He really doesn't seem the type, does he. (Curiouser and curiouser...)




Samurai Spear







Maya:
I wish I had my own Samurai Spear! You'd by my own personal pincushion, Nick!
Phoenix:
Me!? Why me!?




Anything else







Maya:
Sorry, I don't know how that will help us figure this out.October 18Detention CenterVisitor's RoomWill:
Oh, Mr. Wright! Thank you for earlier.Phoenix:
Not at all. We got lucky, to tell the truth.Maya:
You can say that again!Phoenix:
Let's not.Maya:
So, WP! Do you have any leads that might get us going in the right direction?Will:
Hmm... S-sorry, but no.Maya:
Be sure to tell us anything that comes to mind, no matter how small.Phoenix:
We can't rely on getting lucky again tomorrow.Will:
Y-yes... *sniff*Examine









Security guard







Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room.Talk









The fanboy







Phoenix:
Do, er, "fanboys" sneak into the studios often?
Will:
No, not that I know of. That security lady's pretty strict with them.
Maya:
But, in today's testimony, didn't she say they were often hanging around?
Will:
The kids really, really love the Steel Samurai. They sneak past when she's not looking, I guess.




The director







Phoenix:
Was the director present at the morning run-through?
Will:
Y-yes, yes he was. He was directing how the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate should move.
Maya:
Why didn't you tell us that before!?
Will:
W-well, just, the studio asked us to keep quiet...
Maya:
That has nothing to do with this! I hate to repeat myself, but Nick here is a newbie lawyer! Fresh off the bar! When he loses, he's going to lose big!
Will:
I... I see. *sniff*
Phoenix:
(Whose side is she on!?)
Maya:
You aren't hiding anything else from us, are you!?
Will:
N-no, I sure hope not.Present









Cardkey







Phoenix:
We found this cardkey in your dressing room.
Will:
Oh, that's mine, yes.
Maya:
Can people outside the studios get these cards?
Will:
I don't think so. Even I have to return the card. Once the show's done filming, that is.
Maya:
Huh...




Powers's(?) Photo







Phoenix:
Regarding this photograph...
Will:
Y-yes...?
Phoenix:
This really, truly, absolutely isn't you, right?
Will:
R-right. *sniff* I was sleeping in my dressing room the whole time, honest.
Phoenix:
But who else could have worn it!?
Maya:
Your costume was in your dressing room?
Will:
Yes. I guess they snuck in and took it while I was asleep.
Phoenix:
(But who!?)




Samurai Spear







Phoenix:
Regarding the murder weapon...
Will:
Yes?
Phoenix:
Is it heavy, that spear?
Will:
It's pretty hefty, yeah. I don't think the average person would be able to swing it around effectively.
Phoenix:
Hmm...
Maya:
And... that's the spear that broke or something during the morning run-through?
Will:
Oh yes, I goofed on a round kick, you see... I broke the spear. The security lady fixed it for me right away though.
Maya:
With duct tape. We heard.




Anything else







Will:
E-excuse me. Thank you for showing me that, whatever it is. I wish I could think of some way I could help you... S-sorry. *sniff*October 18, 2:16 PMGlobal StudiosMain GateMaya:
No one's here.Phoenix:
Right, now that they have Ms. Oldbag in custody. I guess they don't have anyone else to replace her...Maya:
H-hey! In the guard station! Look! She left her donuts! ... ... What? I wasn't going to eat them!Examine









Computer







Phoenix:
The computer that runs the studio security cameras. Huh? It looks like it's been turned off for the day.




Guard station







Phoenix:
The security guard station. Ms. Oldbag must like junk food. There's a mountain of it on the desk in there.




Main gate







Phoenix:
The main entrance to the studios. They probably have a police officer on patrol out there.October 18Studio One EntranceMaya:
Hey, Nick. It looks like Detective Gumshoe isn't here today.Phoenix:
You're right. He's probably up to his neck in paperwork after the commotion at today's trial.Maya:
So, Nick... Remember that "Studio Two" we heard about at the trial today? It was down that path with the fallen tree, right?Phoenix:
Yeah, I think that's what they said.Maya:
Maybe the director and the rest of them are there today? Now's our chance, Nick! Let's check it out!Examine









Bench







Phoenix:
I'm bushed. Maybe I'll sit down here for a bit.
Maya:
This is exactly why I don't want to get old, ever.
Phoenix:
H-hey! I'm still young! I'm just tired!
Maya:
Nick, when you start having to say "I'm still young," you know it's all over.
Phoenix:
(But... but I AM still young!)




Left path







Phoenix:
In the trial, they said Studio Two was down this path. The monkey head is in the way, but we should be able to get by it without a problem.
Maya:
This monkey head is real heavy!
Phoenix:
Well, it did knock that tree over when it fell.
Maya:
Both of these, the monkey head and the tree, fell the day of the murder, didn't they.
Phoenix:
Yeah, that's what Detective Gumshoe said.




Statue with broken head







Phoenix:
The studio mascot. Apparently it's a monkey of some kind. I've never seen a monkey with a nose like that before!
Maya:
Why don't they put his head back on? Maybe we should ask that assistant?
Phoenix:
I'm not sure we really want her fixing anything. And you'd probably need a crane to move that thing.
Maya:
Probably so.




Security camera







Phoenix:
That's the security camera that automatically takes pictures of people here. It took two pictures on the day of the murder, before the actual time of death. One of them was the Steel Samurai. The other was a grade school boy. It doesn't seem to be switched on today.




Studio One entrance







Phoenix:
The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.




Welcome sign







Maya:
It says "Welcome."
Phoenix:
They let people in here when they're not filming, right?
Maya:
Nick! Let's come here some day! Whaddya say?
Phoenix:
Sure, if that security lady lets us in.October 18Studio OneMaya:
I... don't really want to be in here.Phoenix:
Yeah... It is a murder scene.Maya:
I want to go someplace else. Nick?Phoenix:
(*sigh*...)Examine









Film camera







Maya:
Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!
Phoenix:
Yeah! So don't touch it!
Maya:
Hey, smile, Nick, you're a star!
Phoenix:
S-stop that!




Reflecting screen







Phoenix:
That's for reflecting light. They call it a reflecting screen or something like that.
Maya:
Huh.
Phoenix:
What? Where's your enthusiasm for all things entertainment?
Maya:
Well, lighting is fine, but I'd want to be the director. Or maybe the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
(I think she's being serious...!)




Stage backdrop







Phoenix:
Looks like a backdrop for a stage. This must be used in the Steel Samurai show.
Maya:
Of course! That's the mountain, Neo Fujiyama!
Phoenix:
Doesn't the Steel Samurai take place in Olde Tokyo? Can you even see Mt. Fuji from there?
Maya:
Not Olde Tokyo, Nick! "Neo" Olde Tokyo!October 18Studio Two EntranceMaya:
This... is Studio Two?Phoenix:
I thought so...Maya:
It doesn't really look much like a "studio," does it?Phoenix:
No, that it does not.Maya:
Hey... There's a trailer over there.Phoenix:
It looks pretty sturdy for a movie set trailer.Maya:
Are we sure this is a studio?Examine









Incinerator







Phoenix:
An incinerator. Apparently they just put this one in. It's already covered in soot. They must not clean it much.




Lunch table







Phoenix:
Looks like two people ate here. There's nothing left on the plates.
Maya:
Hey, so they ate t-bone steaks too.
Phoenix:
What is it with steaks around here?
Maya:
Hey! There's always room for steak! But... something does seem out of place...
Phoenix:
What?
Maya:
I... don't know. It just feels "odd."




Number "2" sign







Phoenix:
There's a big "2" painted here.
Maya:
Probably because this is Studio Two?
Phoenix:
Probably... Though it doesn't look anything like a studio.




Studio van







Phoenix:
A light van for moving staff and equipment around. They've kept it in pretty good shape. Looks like it'd run fine.
Maya:
Well, let's go for a drive!
Phoenix:
Sure... if I had a license.
Maya:
Nick! You don't have a driver's license!?
Phoenix:
But, look, I have this!
Maya:
Why are you showing me your attorney's badge, Nick?




Flower garden







Phoenix:
There're some flowers here.
Maya:
Wow, so pretty! They're taking good care of these.
Phoenix:
Don't get to [sic] close. That fence looks dangerous.




Storage materials







Phoenix:
These look like materials for making a movie set.
Maya:
They've been sitting here for quite some time. This might as well be a junkyard.




Trailer







Phoenix:
On closer inspection, this trailer looks like it's been here for a while. I don't think this is part of some temporary film set.




Trailer door







Maya:
Nick! Let's go inside!
Phoenix:
You think it's okay...? Oh well. It's locked.
Maya:
Aww... shucks.October 18Global StudiosEmployee AreaMaya:
Look, it's that assistant girl. Hey!Penny:

You mean that one? (Wow, what a mess...)Penny:
I... I know... I'm not so good with handiwork. Some assistant, right?Maya:
Yeah, but you do work on the props, and the backdrops, right?Penny:

Oh? Oh! Well, I'm sure these things happen. Nothing to worry yourself about!Penny:
You're right! I won't!Phoenix:

Right! See you later, then!Penny:
Good luck with your investigation.Examine









Taped cardboard barrier







Maya:
So, the fanboy they were talking about in the trial today... He came in through that drain?
Phoenix:
So it seems. I guess they covered it up in a hurry.
Maya:
Hey... Hey, Nick! If that drain's covered, the boy won't be able to get in.
Phoenix:
Uh, yeah. I think that was the idea...?
Maya:
I feel kinda sorry for him, though. Don't you?
Phoenix:
What, you want to rip the grate off?
Maya:
Really, Nick? We can!?
Phoenix:
(Whoa... she's serious? Uh oh...)



Rip it open







Phoenix:
Well, I guess some things are just made to be broken.
Maya:
Yay! You know, Nick, you're pretty swell sometimes.
Phoenix:
(Sometimes...?)
Maya:
Hiii-ya! There. That should make the kids happy.
Phoenix:
The things we do...
Leads back to examination




Leave it be







Phoenix:
Nah, I think we should leave it on. They only just repaired it. And if we take it off, that assistant will get yelled at by you-know-who.
Maya:
Yeah... I guess so.
Phoenix:
(Wow! I didn't expect her to take it that hard...)
Leads back to examination





Drain grate (after selecting "Rip it open" upon examining taped cardboard barrier)







Phoenix:
The drain grate is off. And I know who did it.
Maya:
Now the kids'll be able to come in again. Doesn't it make you feel great to do a good deed like that?
Phoenix:
(Must be nice to live so free of guilt.)




Lunch table







Phoenix:
The remains of yesterday's lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak.




Dressing room door







Phoenix:
The door to the dressing room. It's not locked.
Maya:
Hey, Nick! Let's go in! Maybe there'll be something else to steal?
Phoenix:
H-hey! We're not thieves!
Maya:
But we did take that cardkey...
Phoenix:
W-we borrowed that! There's a difference.




Vending machine







Phoenix:
Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks or something. Popcorn, at least!
Maya:
W-wait! Look! "Samurai Soda"! Nick! Try this!
Phoenix:
Be my guest.
Maya:
Okay! Oh, too bad, it's sold out.October 18Global StudiosDressing RoomMaya:
This is where the Steel Samurai costume was, on the day of the murder.Phoenix:
That's what Mr. Powers says, at least. I guess they snuck in and took it while he was sleeping.Maya:
But Nick, what if Mr. Powers hadn't been sleeping? I wonder what the killer was planning on doing then?Phoenix:
Huh... (She's got a point!)Examine









Cosmetics







Phoenix:
There's an array of cosmetics here. According to Maya, that wig was used in some old TV show...
Maya:
"Samurai Boogey-Woogey," Nick! Get with the picture!
Phoenix:
Look, explain to me how you can identify a show just by seeing a wig!?
Maya:
I, um, kinda like samurai movies.
Phoenix:
("Kinda"...?)




Costume rack







Phoenix:
There's some regular suits in among the costumes here. Those must be Mr. Powers's personal clothes.




Couch







Phoenix:
Looks like someone was sleeping here. Maybe Powers did take a nap here, like he said.




Bag







Maya:
Mr. Powers's bag. I wonder what's inside? Hey! Supermarket tabloids? Wow. I'm kind of shocked.
Phoenix:
Maya! Leave those alone! (Wolf Men Found On Mars...? I'll have to buy that issue!)




Table







Phoenix:
There's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Some tea and cookies...
Maya:
Wait... Nick!
Phoenix:
W-what now?
Maya:
These snacks... they've passed the expiration date!
Phoenix:
... Then don't eat them.
Maya:
*grumble* (They're snacks! They're meant to be eaten!)




Window







Phoenix:
It's locked. I guess he doesn't open his window much. It is kind of dusty outside.Studio - Main Gate (after selecting "Rip it open" upon examining taped cardboard barrier in Global Studios - Employee Area)Penny:
Oh... hello.Maya:
Ho hoh! You look a little out of place.Penny:
It's the clothes, isn't it? I thought my camo vest might do the trick... Kind of an "alternative guard fashion" thing.Examine









Guard station







Phoenix:
The security guard station. I can see the computer that runs the security cameras.
Penny:
Oh, please don't touch anything in there. The security lady would knock the stuffing out of me if she knew.Talk









The studios







Phoenix:
So, how are the studios doing?
Penny:
There's police wandering around everywhere, it's terrible. They won't even let me clean up. Don't want me "disturbing evidence." I haven't even cleaned up our lunch plates from the day of the murder!
Phoenix:
You mean those plates with the steak bones left over on them in the employee area?
Penny:
Yeah. Can you believe it?




The fanboy







Maya:
Do kids sneak in here a lot?
Penny:
Well... I don't think there's that many of them, but I do see one in particular a bunch. He's always gawking at the sets, or snapping pictures. You should see Old Windbag's eyes flash when she sees him. She has a bit of trouble catching him though...




The director, et al.







Phoenix:
I heard something at the trial today. They said that the director and producer were here the day of the murder...
Penny:
Oh, sorry... I was in the prop storage room, so I didn't see them. I guess they were here, though. The studio head seemed pretty eager to keep us quiet.
Maya:
So they were trying to protect the director?
Penny:
More the producer, really. The producer's our real star here. She saved these studios from the brink of disaster and kept them running. I don't think we'd still be in business if it weren't for that producer!
Phoenix:
(The producer, huh?)Present









Cardkey







Penny:
Wow, they gave a lawyer one of those cardkeys?
Phoenix:
Well, I'm sort of borrowing it.
Penny:
I see. You better be careful not to lose that. They're very strict about those cardkeys here.
Phoenix:
(I guess they're pretty good about keeping these out of outsider's hands.) Thanks, I'll be careful.




Powers's(?) Photo







Phoenix:
Could you take a look at this?
Penny:
That's Mr. Powers. Why is he dragging his leg like that? What is this, anyway?
Phoenix:
(Looks like she didn't know about this photo or the injury that morning.) Uh... Never mind.




Samurai Spear







Phoenix:
Say, you work with the props, right? About that murder weapon...
Penny:
You mean the Samurai Spear? Yeah, it's a prop, but it's still pretty heavy. I hate having to carry that thing around.
Phoenix:
(So you'd have to be pretty strong to use that as a weapon, it sounds like. Why is Mr. Powers the only person I can think of!?)

The day of the crime







Phoenix:
Did you notice anything unusual on the day of the murder?
Manella:
Oh, I know who j00 d00dz are. That security lady told j00 about us, eh?
Phoenix:
That's right.
Manella:
It was a pretty regular day. We had a run-through for an action scene in the morning. Then a meeting from lunchtime in the Studio Two trailer. Heh. I was so busy I didn't even get a chance to eat lunch! :(
Phoenix:
A t-bone steak, was it?
Manella:
Yeah... sux0rz! I hate missing out on food...
Maya:
Nick... what does "Sucksores" mean?
Phoenix:
No idea...
Manella:
Anyway, I was in a meeting from noon till after 4:00. With the producer, and some bigwigs from the network.
Phoenix:
(Mr. Hammer's time of death was estimated at 2:30 PM. If he's telling the truth, that meeting gives him an alibi...)




The producer (appears after "The day of the crime")







Phoenix:
About the producer who was at the meeting with you...
Manella:
Oh, you mean Dee Vasquez? She's a genius. M4d sk1llz, all the way. Scary, though. *sweats* She brought these studios back from the brink of destruction. She's the one who made it possible for me to make the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
You had a meeting with her on the day of the murder, right?
Manella:
Yeah, we were together from noon to 4:00 PM, the whole time.




The bigwigs (appears after "The day of the crime")







Phoenix:
Who exactly are these "bigwigs" people keep mentioning?
Manella:
Oh, the boss over at the network, and some sponsors. Also a few production guys. They piled into a limousine and got here right around noon. Major tension! *sweats*
Phoenix:
Were all of them with you the entire time?
Manella:
Yeah, unfortunately. They're all gray-haired geezers... *scowl*

Powers's(?) Photo







Manella:

W-what!?Vasquez:
It's true. A crane came just after 3:00 to move the head. We called some people in to clear the way. I'm sure they'd corroborate my story.Phoenix:

A classic director's chair. I'm surprised they don't have an extra large one for Mr. Manella.




Film camera







Phoenix:
A collection of expensive film equipment. I can't even begin to imagine how much just one of these costs. If we broke one, we'd go bankrupt for sure.




Reflecting screen







Phoenix:
A panel for reflecting light. They call it a "reflecting board" or something.




Stage backdrop







Phoenix:
A stage backdrop. This is "Neo Fujiyama," according to Maya. It looks incredibly fake, but I guess the kids don't mind.




(Step)ladder







Phoenix:
A perfectly normal stepladder. I've never actually used one. I don't like heights. I'm a firm belever that humankind was made to keep both feet on the ground.Outside Studio TwoExamine









Lunch table







Phoenix:
Looks like two people ate here. There's nothing left on the plates.




Number "2" sign







Phoenix:
There's a big "2" painted here. Probably because this is Studio Two? Probably... Though it doesn't look anything like a studio.




Studio van







Phoenix:
A light van for moving staff and equipment around. They've kept it in pretty good shape. Looks like it'd run fine.




Flower garden







Phoenix:
Nameless flowers bloom in solitude. They probably have a proper name... But it is not for me to know. Not now, nor ever till the end of my days. ... I need a vacation.




Storage materials







Phoenix:
These look like materials for making a movie set. They've been sitting here for quite some time. This might as well be a junkyard.




Trailer door







Phoenix:
The door is unlocked. We could probably just walk right in.TrailerExamine









Left poster







Phoenix:
Another old movie poster. "'The Singing Samurai' starring Jack Hammer." What the hell do samurai sing about? Chopping off heads?
Mia:
It's a samurai musical set in ancient Japan.
Phoenix:
A s-samurai musical? Is that even a genre!? Well, I'm impressed. You know your stuff, Mia.
Mia:
Oh, Maya's the real fan. I just picked a little up.




Middle poster







Phoenix:
"'Samurai Summer' starring Jack Hammer." This poster looks like it's been hanging here for years.
Mia:
This is one of Maya's favorite movies.
Phoenix:
Maybe we should replace the poster in the office with this one?
Mia:
That... would be kind of sad.October 18Global StudiosEmployee AreaPhoenix:

Yeah. His name's "Cody Hackins."Mia:

Bicycle







Phoenix:
Looks like one of those electric-powered bicycles. I dunno about these. I mean, what's the point?
Mia:
It makes it a lot easier to go up hills!
Phoenix:
Where have I heard that line before...?




Dressing room door







Phoenix:
The door to the dressing room. It's not locked.
Mia:
This is where Cody ran... Let's go in and see if we can get him to talk.




Storage room door







Phoenix:
That must be the storage room. That's where they keep all the film equipment.




Vending machine







Phoenix:
Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks, or something. Popcorn, at least!
Mia:
Look at this! "Spaghetti in a Soda Can"...?
Phoenix:
S-spaghetti? Wouldn't just the sauce come out and the noodles all stay stuck inside?
Mia:
"Best when slammed." I guess they want you to drink it in one gulp...?
Phoenix:
Slamming spaghetti. Right...October 18Global StudiosDressing RoomPhoenix:

Cosmetics







Phoenix:
There's an array of cosmetics here. According to Maya, that wig was used in some old TV show...
Cody:
You don't know "Samurai Boogey-Woogey"!? You're even lamer than I thought!
Phoenix:
(Why does everybody but me know about this show!?)




Powers's bag







Phoenix:
Mr. Powers's bag.
Mia:
Now, Phoenix, it's not polite to look through other people's belongings.
Phoenix:
H-hey, don't look at me! (Tell that to your sister!)




Table







Phoenix:
There's a box of snacks on the table, and some cans of soda. They're all empty. I'm glad Maya isn't here to see this. She'd be devastated.
Mia:
Sorry? What was that about Maya?
Phoenix:
O-oh, nothing.Talk









The Steel Samurai







Phoenix:
The Steel Samurai's so cool. I think he's the, um, the "bomb."
Cody:
Hah! What would a lamer like you know about the Steel Samurai!

"You are"... huh?
Cody:
"U.R." You know, "ultra rare"! That card's really hard to get! Man, for a grown-up, you sure are dumb!
Phoenix:
I'll give you this... IF you help me.
Cody:
But that's my card! By offering me something I already own, you're in effect eschewing the very basis of our consumer society, namely the principle of fair trade! Man, for a grown-up, you sure are dumb!
Phoenix:
(W-what do they teach these kids in school these days!? Quantum physics!?)
Cody:
Whatever, I don't need that card.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Cody:
I got a double. Just keep it. It's yours.
Phoenix:
(What!? After I went through all that trouble...)
Cody:
If you want to trade, find me a REALLY rare card!
Phoenix:
"Really rare"!? You mean there's something rarer than "Ultra Rare"!?
Cody:
Ultra Rare Premium cards are way rarer than plain Ultra Rare cards! Come ON! Man, for a grown-up, you sure are dumb!
Phoenix:
Premium... rare... why do I feel like we're talking about steaks?

The fanboy







Phoenix:
Have you seen that boy since then?
Penny:
Nope. You missed it, though. The security lady was chasing around after the boy so fast I thought she'd collapse. Of course, he got away in the end. Boy, was she mad!
Phoenix:
Actually, we saw them. How's the old windbag doing?
Penny:
She was squeezing donuts through her clenched fists back at the guard station.

Yes. It's really a terrible loss for the studios.

The Steel Samurai







Phoenix:
So... you like the Steel Samurai.

What is it, Cody?Cody:
Th-the Steel Samurai killed the bad guy! He used his Samurai Spear! Just like always! One shot, one kill! It happened so fast... I got scared. I went home after that.Phoenix:

Man, you say those nice things but it's so obvious you aren't speaking from the heart.Phoenix:

Yes?Phoenix:
I think we can say for sure this means the Steel Samurai did it.Mia:
True enough.Phoenix:
And the director has an alibi, so it wasn't him.Mia:
Indeed.Phoenix:
So... the only person left who it could have been is Will Powers!Mia:

Why do you look so... unhappy?Phoenix:
O-oh! Oh, nothing! Eh heh heh. Really, it's nothing. Right, Mia? (Uh oh. She looks even unhappier...)Mia:
Phoenix. Your client is now practically a dead man walking... Perhaps that's why I feel particularly close to him.Phoenix:
This is no time for dead-people jokes, please.Mia:
You know we're going into this trial utterly defenseless. Yet, if Mr. Powers is truly innocent... We should be able to find something overlooked in the evidence to prove it.Phoenix:
Something "overlooked"...?Mia:
We have to find something, Phoenix, today. It's that, or lose the trial.Phoenix:
(This isn't going to be easy.)October 19, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:
Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth:
An unexpected fact has come to the attention of the court. Yesterday, we learned that there were other people present at the studios. Today, I would like to show evidence proving they had nothing to do with the murder.Judge:
Very well. You may call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth.Phoenix:
(I wonder if it'll be that producer...) (Changed from [I wonder if that producer is going to come out...] in the original release)Edgeworth:

Were you at Global Studios on the day of the murder?Manella:
Y-yes, Your Honor.Judge:
Hmm... Very well. Please testify to the court about the events of that day.Mia:
Phoenix. Let's start by picking this testimony apart. If Powers is innocent, you know what that means. Someone in the trailer on that day did it!Phoenix:
R-right. (She doesn't waste any time putting on the pressure!)Witness Testimony-- The Day of the Murder --Manella:
I was at the studios from around 9:00 that morning.
During the morning, I was doing... umm... an action scene run-through.
It took a lot more time than I thought it would.
I hear that everyone else ate lunch in the Employee Area...
But I had a meeting in the Studio Two trailer, so I ended up skipping lunch.
We were in the meeting until around 4:00...
During the meeting, well, I'm pretty sure no one left their chairs.
That's about it.Judge:
Hmm... The time of Mr. Hammer's death was 2:30 PM. And according to your testimony, you were in a meeting at that time. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Yeah?
Mia:
Doesn't something about that seem odd to you?



Not at all







Phoenix:
Well, no, not really. Seems pretty straightforward.
Mia:
Oh. Perhaps I was wrong, then.
Leads back to cross-examination




It's a little vague







Phoenix:
Actually, there is something bothering me. Mr. Manella, just now you said "steak, at least." So you ate something other than steak?
Manella:
Yeah, good call! I had some chocolate in my pocket, which I used to stave off starvation!
Phoenix:
I see... (Is that all? I was sure I was on to something there.)
Leads back to cross-examination




It's contradictory







Phoenix:
Yeah, it does seem odd, now that you mention it. Mr. Manella!
Manella:
H-hmm? W-what do j00 mean? *sweats*
Phoenix:
When I went to Studio Two, I saw something on the table there.

Manella:
M-mmpf! No, er, ah, um, eh heh. Good call! *sweats* I, er, I was embarrassed so I didn't mention it... But I did eat, after all.
Phoenix:
A t-bone steak, you mean?
Manella:
Yeah, well, I mean the assistant went through all that trouble... I brought it to the trailer thinking I could eat it later.
Phoenix:
(Clearly a man who likes to eat. I'd suspected as much...) So, when exactly did you eat it?
Manella:
We took one break during that meeting. I, er, wolfed it down then. *drool*
Phoenix:
(A mental image I will carry with me to my grave... Wait a second...! If they took a break in that meeting, that contradicts his testimony! I'll press on that one a bit more...)

Phoenix:

What were you discussing?
Manella:
The Steel Samurai story, and our budget. Get this! The sponsors turn to me and say, "Mr. Manella. Those scripts of yours are not appropriate for children." Can j00 believe it!?

Oops! ROFL!Phoenix:
Well?Manella:
Umm...Judge:
Mr. Manella, what's this all about?Manella:
W-well, yeah, I guess we did take a little break.Mia:

Yeah, FWIW, we took a break... ROFL!
But it was only 15 minutes! 15! That's only 13 in Base 12!
Not enough time for someone to, say, commit murder in Studio One! LOL!
That's only just enough time to eat a t-bone steak, if you ask me! *steams*Judge:

What time exactly did you take this break?

To eat a t-bone steak in 15 minutes... that's quite a feat.Manella:
Not enough time for someone to, say, commit murder in Studio One! LOL!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Why is that?Press (after pressing first statement)







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Why is that?"Manella:
That's only just enough time to eat a t-bone steak, if you ask me! *steams*Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
I have to say, you look like a guy who gets through his meals pretty fast.
Manella:
Well, I was facing a cold, slightly chewy t-bone steak... Even I have to take my time eating that kind of food. LOLMia:
Well, Phoenix?Phoenix:
That testimony was too short to wring any kind of useful information out of!Mia:
All you have to do is prove that he was able to go to Studio One in that time!Phoenix:
(Oh, great. Is that all...)Phoenix:
Why is that?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
Haven't we had enough of this pointless line of questioning? Your Honor! The testimony to this point has made one certain fact painfully clear: The people in the trailer had nothing to do with this murder! It was impossible for any of them to go to Studio One!Phoenix:
What!?Edgeworth:
Something wrong, Mr. Wright? Surely you aren't suggesting one of the people in the trailer went to Studio One!Judge:
Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright?Mia:
Phoenix, this is critical! Think about it before you give your answer!Judge:
Do you claim someone from the trailer went to Studio One?I claim it, and claim it loud







Phoenix:
(If I agree to let everyone in that trailer off the hook then the trial is over... Mr. Powers will be found guilty for sure!) The victim was murdered at 2:30, the exact time of the break in the meeting. With 15 minutes, murder is certainly a possibility!
Judge:
Hmm... I suppose you might say that...
Phoenix:
(Alright, I've got the judge thinking now!)
Edgeworth:
Tsk, tsk, tsk... Never a dull moment with you, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
What's your point, Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
You've been doing your homework, haven't you? Look at the Court Record.
Phoenix:
The Court Record...?
Edgeworth:
Surely, you knew that from 2:15 to 4:00 the path between the studios was blocked? Mrs. Monkey's head had fallen across the path!
Phoenix:
Whoa! You're right!
Edgeworth:
True, the break in the trailer meeting came right at the time of death... However! The path from there to the scene of the crime was blocked! The fallen Mrs. Monkey head barred the way!
Phoenix:
... (It's actually "Mr. Monkey," but Edgeworth has a point... And somehow, I feel no desire to correct him.)
Judge:
No counter-argument, Mr. Wright? Then I'm afraid you lose this round.
Leads to:
"I believe we have seen enough evidence."No, it's impossible.







Phoenix:
(I don't want to write off so many possible suspects... But I can't keep claiming the impossible, either...) I agree that it was impossible for anyone in the trailer to go to the studio in that time.
Edgeworth:
Ha hah! I thought you might be thoughtlessly treading on thin ice again! But I see you had at least an inkling of the truth.
Judge:
What do you mean, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
It's quite simple... True, the break in the trailer meeting came right at the time of death... However! The path from there to the scene of the crime was blocked! The fallen Mrs. Monkey head barred the way! At around 2:15, a strong gust of wind knocked off the studio mascot's head. Ergo! When the people in the trailer took a break at 2:30, the way to the studio was blocked. Blocked... by Mrs. Monkey's severed head!
Phoenix:
... (It's actually "Mr. Monkey," but Edgeworth has a point... And somehow, I feel no desire to correct him.)
Leads to:
"I believe we have seen enough evidence."Edgeworth:
I believe we have seen enough evidence. I would like to relieve Mr. Manella from the stand.Phoenix:
(Wh-what? It's over?)Judge:
Very well. The court's opinion on this case is as follows: We have found that there were several other people in Studio 2 on the day of the murder. However, it is also clear that none of these people could have gone to Studio One. They therefore have no relation to this case. Furthermore, with regards to the photo of the Steel Samurai... Given the size of the costume, no one other than Mr. Powers could have worn it that day. All that is lacking is decisive evidence that he is the one who did it. If we had that, I'm afraid I would have to find Mr. Powers guilty.Edgeworth:
Your Honor. The prosecution is pleased to announce that we indeed have decisive evidence: a witness.Judge:
Who is this witness, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:
My witness saw the very moment when the Steel Samurai skewered the victim!Judge:
Order! I will have order! I see. The court will take a 10 minute recess, after which we will hear your witness. Court is adjourned for recess!October 19, 11:04 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Mia:

What do we do now, Mia? If everyone in that trailer has an alibi...Mia:
... I'm sorry, Phoenix. I guess I was wrong.Phoenix:
M-Mia! Don't tell me you're giving up! If you give up, what hope do I have...?Mia:
... Don't get me wrong. I've never given up on a trial before, not while there was a chance. Only one thing became clear in your cross-examination. The people in the trailer could not have gone to Studio One. I thought there was more to it than that... But I was wrong. That's all there is.Will:
Umm... Er... What's going to happen to me? It kinda seems like everyone in that courtroom thinks I did it... They think I'm a murderer!Mia:
Don't worry, Mr. Powers. If you are innocent, we will prove it. I guarantee it. Leave it to us, and... be yourself. Be strong. You are the Steel Samurai, hero to children everywhere, after all.Will:
I... You... Thanks. *sniff*Mia:
Okay, Phoenix. This one's for the kids! Let's do it!October 19, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:
Court is back in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:
The prosecution has a concern. As our witness is a grade schooler of tender years, and this is a murder case... we worry that the defense might cause unnecessary trauma with his cruel questioning. (Changed from [We worry that the defense might cause unnecessary trauma with his cruel questioning!] in the original release)Phoenix:
(Nice to see Edgeworth taking the moral high ground...)Edgeworth:
However, we have no choice. The prosecution calls Cody Hackins to the stand.Edgeworth:
Your Honor. Perhaps you could arrange a box for him to stand on?Judge:
Oh, r-right. Guard, please bring him a box. One of those donut crates should do.Edgeworth:
Will the witness state his name and grade in school.Cody:

Hey! I just got this new camera! Don't really know how to use it all that good yet! But I bring it with me wherever I go!Mia:

Very well, Cody. Please testify to the court about what you saw the day of the incident.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Cody:
I wanted to see a Steel Samurai rehearsal, just once.
I found a map on the Internet, and went to the studios that day.
I went through the woods off the path, so that old lady wouldn't catch me.
I was going for the studio.
I got kinda lost on the way, though. For about 30 minutes.
When I came out by the studio, there was the Steel Samurai!
It totally rocked! Right before my eyes, out came the bad guy!
Of course, the Steel Samurai took him down! Pow!
If I had my camera with me, that woulda been the time for a shot, I tell you.
Anyway, I couldn't get into the studio, so I went home.Judge:

Um, well... er, that's the thing...Mia:
Phoenix! I believe you're on the right track with this! Think: why didn't Cody see the climax of the fight? I know you! You can figure this out!Judge:
Mr. Wright, your answer! We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai... Why wouldn't he watch the climax of the fight?He couldn't watch it







Phoenix:
Because he couldn't watch it! How could he calmly watch a murder taking place at his age!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Just a moment, please... One thing has become quite clear in this boy's testimony. He did not believe he was witnessing a murder! He was watching the Steel Samurai fight, like on TV. The more real the fight, the more he would have watched!
Phoenix:
Umm... huh.

I have to agree with Mr. Edgeworth. Well, Mr. Wright. Do you have another explanation?

"We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai..."He was watching something else

He missed the climax of the fight... because he was looking at something else! Probably!

Good job, Phoenix! Cody was lying, clearly. Smart of you to realize there was no way he could just stand there, watching his hero... and not take a picture!Phoenix:
Right! Cody? There was only one reason why you would have looked away from the fight. And that was because you wanted to take a picture. But having just received your camera, you weren't used to using it yet! So, you missed the climax of the fight. Correct?Cody:
... ... ... Yeah.Mia:
Well, Phoenix. I'll bet you anything he's hiding more than that. Have him testify again!Phoenix:

Yeah, you're right, pops.
The Steel Samurai had just escaped from the clutches of the villain.
So I held up my camera to take a picture!

2024-11-29 17:19:46 [INFO] HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2024-11-29 17:19:46 [INFO] Assistant reply: To find the contradiction in Cody's testimony, let's carefully evaluate each statement against the available evidence and context from the case:

1. Cody starts by agreeing, acknowledging the Steel Samurai had just escaped a villain, and implies he was ready to capture the moment with his camera: "Yeah, you're right, pops."
2. He indicates he aimed his camera intending to take a photo of the Steel Samurai: "So I held up my camera to take a picture!"
3. Cody then claims the lens didn't open in time, causing him to miss the shot: "But the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it."

Considering Cody's enthusiasm and dedication toward the Steel Samurai, as well as his admission that he had his camera with him and wanted to take a photo, we can scrutinize his ability to use it. Earlier, it was established that his camera is a digital one, and he's still figuring out how to use it. However, it seems unlikely that a simple technical fault like the lens not opening would so conveniently occur and result in a missed opportunity to photograph his hero.

Importantly, evidence item 15 is Cody's Camera, which supports his novice status with the device. Though there's no specific technical problem noted in the evidence, his claim that the "lens wouldn't open" when he was so eager to capture the scene is suspect.

Since Cody previously stated he always carries his camera and would naturally want to photograph any action involving the Steel Samurai, his failure to take a photo — especially claiming it was due to a mechanical failure — is dubious. Throughout the case, presenting contradictions often involves highlighting discrepancies in the testimony against the information characters or evidence provide indirectly.

Ultimately, point 4 in his final testimony, "Th-that's all that happened. Yup," is especially significant because it offers an easy point to challenge his credibility given these inconsistencies about the camera usage.

Therefore, we can present his camera as evidence against the testimony point where he mentioned missing the chance due to the lens issue, as this directly reflects a possible contradiction or an admission of some obscured truth.

He was arrested on suspicion of murder. The victim was Jack Hammer, who plays the villain known as the "Evil Magistrate." His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. The "Samurai Spear" was also found stuck through the body. Police believe this was the murder weapon, and are investigating further.Phoenix:

Bookshelf







Phoenix:
There's a horrendous amount of legal books here. Scarier still is the thought that I have to read all of these now.




Houseplant







Phoenix:
Mia's favorite potted plant. Maya has been watering it so much lately it looks a little... swollen. She's either trying to make it grow... or she's perfecting her water torture technique.




Movie poster







Phoenix:
A poster of an old movie that Mia liked. I was thinking I should go see it myself. Then I realized that the poster doesn't actually say the title of the movie.




Desk







Phoenix:
Mia's desk. Actually... it's my desk now. Sitting here always makes me feel like a professional.




Window







Phoenix:
It's a nice day outside. The hotel across the way is always full these days. There's the bellboy, happily cleaning the room.Talk









What to do







Phoenix:
Well, what should we do?
Maya:
What should we do!? How can you just sit there like that!? We have to get down to the detention center and meet the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:

Any ideas

Security guard







Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room. He seems frozen in awe of Will Powers.Talk









What happened







Phoenix:
Maybe you could start by telling us what happened.
Will:
Y-yes. Of course. It seems like it was only yesterday. Actually, it was only yesterday. The cast had come down to Global Studios for a run-through. We went through a few action sequences at 10:00 that morning. There was a rehearsal scheduled for 5:00 in the afternoon. But when 5:00 came around, and the staff gathered at the studio... The Evil Magistrate was found lying in a crumpled heap near the set. They took off his mask... And discovered that it was Jack Hammer... dead! He had been expertly skewered with the Samurai Spear.
Phoenix:
The "Samurai Spear"...?
Will:
Yes, it's a long spear that I... that the Steel Samurai uses as a weapon.




The Steel Samurai







Phoenix:
Maybe you could explain to me just what "the Steel Samurai" is.
Maya:
Nick! How could you say such a thing? I-I'm sorry, sir, I apologize for my partner! He's new to this, and a bit OUT OF TOUCH with the world.
Phoenix:
Hey! Who's "new to this"!?
Will:
No, it's alright, really. The Steel Samurai is the lead character in a popular kid's show. He walks the streets of Neo Olde Tokyo... Fighting battle after battle against the Evil Magistrate and his minions. Of course, he never really defeats the Evil Magistrate. Although... I guess he did defeat him this time... *sniff* Uwaaah!
Phoenix:
I-I see. (Neo Olde Tokyo...? Who comes up with these names!?)




Powers's alibi (appears after "What happened")







Phoenix:
Now, where were you on the day of the murder?
Will:
Well, that morning I came to studios at 9:00. We worked through some action scenes until noon. Rehearsal was to begin at 5:00, but I was a little tired. So after lunch, I took a nap in my dressing room. When I woke up, it was after 5:00! I was late for the rehearsal! I hurried to the studio... and found everyone looking shocked. They arrested me on the spot, and brought me here.
Phoenix:
(So he was sleeping the entire afternoon of the murder? Some action hero!)
Will:
What will the kids think? *sniff*Present

Gawkers! Sightseers! Tourists!!! I know the type. You heard about the incident and came to snoop around. Youths today! Something horrible happens and all you can think of is sightseeing. Wasting your time at a place like this. Don't you have jobs you should be doing? Or do lawyers not work like the rest of us? Maybe I should become a lawyer too. Sounds like a life of ease to me no work just loafing around all day as you please. Well when I was young things were a mite different, mind you we didn't prance around in strange hippie clothes. What are the youths coming to these days my own son hasn't called in...Maya:

Computer







Phoenix:
The computer that runs the studio security cameras.
Oldbag:
Hey! No touching!




Guard station







Phoenix:
The security guard station. That security lady must like junk food. There's a mountain of it on the desk in there. I can see the computer that runs the security cameras.




Main gate







Phoenix:
The main entrance to the studio. There was a big scene here yesterday with onlookers pressing up against the gate.




Studio map







Phoenix:
An overhead map of the studios. Right from here is the Employee Area. To the left are the actual film studios.




Studio van







Phoenix:
Looks like a studio van. They probably use it to carry around film equipment.Talk









The studios







Phoenix:
So, what do you do here at the studios?
Oldbag:
At Global Studios, we make children's dreams come true! In fact, in my younger days...
Maya:
No! You were a star!?
Oldbag:
Only a little twinkle between the stars here, I'm afraid, dearie.
Maya:
Wo... wow.
Oldbag:
This place has really gone downhill, you know? But 10 years ago, now that was a studio of dreams! Hammer was a big star back then too, he was...
Phoenix:
Hammer...?
Oldbag:
The victim, dummy! The Evil Magistrate! He's been reduced to playing villains now. Not exactly the best material to work with...




Will Powers







Phoenix:
Can you tell me about Mr. Will Powers?
Oldbag:
He's not a bad kid, but don't be fooled by his mask! You wouldn't want him on the silver screen without it, believe me. Little old ladies watching would lose their lunch! That's probably why he thought that the Steel Samurai was his "big chance." No one thought he was capable of doing what he did to poor Jack Hammer...
Maya:
We don't know for certain that Will Powers is guilty!
Oldbag:
Powers? Of course he's guilty! How do I know? I know everything! That's my job.




Mr. Hammer (appears after "The studios")







Phoenix:
What kind of person was Jack Hammer?
Oldbag:
What "kind of person"? Oh... if you only knew! Jack Hammer will live on in many hearts as the ultimate action hero! He was simply dashing in the Dynamite Samurai series!
Phoenix:
(Should I have heard of that...?)
Oldbag:
But... there was an accident during filming five years ago. He got an unlucky break after that. Reduced to playing the villain on a children's program! What's more, I heard they were paying him peanuts. It's enough to make you cry.




Reason for suspicion (appears after "Will Powers")







Phoenix:
Why are you so certain Mr. Powers is the killer?
Oldbag:
I was standing right here yesterday, I was. I was here from 1:00 in the afternoon, to 5:00, when they found the body! Now the studio where the murder took place is to the left here. So if you want to go to the studio, you have to pass by me! Only one person went by here between 1:00 and 2:30, when the murder took place!
Phoenix:
And... that person was Mr. Powers?
Oldbag:
Yes. I saw him!
Phoenix:
But Mr. Powers says he was sleeping in his dressing room.
Oldbag:
Oh, I'm sure he would say that. He's no fool! But he was the only one that walked by. He's the killer, you can bet your biscuits on it.Present









Anything







Oldbag:
What's that? You giving that to me?
Phoenix:

Your alibi







Phoenix:
Mr. Powers, you aren't hiding anything from me, are you?
Will:
W-what? No! I'd never do that!
Phoenix:
Just now you said that you were sleeping in your dressing room after lunch.
Will:
Yes. Like a baby.
Phoenix:
But the security lady said she saw you that day. She says she saw you heading towards the scene of the crime!
Will:
W-what!? That's not possible! I... I really don't know what to say! I was sleeping, I promise!
Phoenix:
Mr. Powers, if you want me to help you, you have to tell me the truth. I'm new to this lawyer business, and I need every advantage I can get.
Will:
I know... I-I'm sorry. *sniff* But, I swear to you on my momma's grave, I was sleeping. Maybe the security lady only thought she saw me?
Phoenix:
(What did she see...? He doesn't seem to be lying.)




The security lady







Phoenix:
Umm... about the security guard at the main gate to the studio...
Will:
Oh, the security lady?
Maya:
She's terrible! She called me "suspicious lookin'"!
Will:
Y-yes... actually, she's said the same thing to me before. "Take off that mask!" were her words, I believe. She sucks up to all the bigwigs at the studio... But let her see you stumble once and she'll never let up on you.
Maya:
Grr! She's got some nerve!
Phoenix:
Do you think you could write up a letter formally requesting my representation?
Will:
Of c-course.
Powers's Request added to the Court Record.
Phoenix:

Powers's Letter

Bench







Phoenix:
I'm a little bushed. Maybe I'll take a short rest here.
Gumshoe:
Hey, good idea, pal!
Maya:
Detective! Aren't you on the case?
Gumshoe:
W-well, yeah, but... Hey, us detectives get tired of standing around too, pal!




Left path







Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe, what's down the path to the left? It looks like a tree fell down over the path...?
Gumshoe:
Oh, yeah. That way's kind of dangerous. You should stay out, pal. There's nothing down there, anyway. That's where Studio Two used to be, they tell me. They don't use it now, though.




Statue with broken head







Phoenix:
The studio mascot. I guess it's a monkey of some kind. But what kind of monkey has a nose like that? He's holding a sign in his hand. [Right: To Studio One; Left: To Studio Two]
Maya:
What's up with that thing!? It looks kind of... busted.
Gumshoe:
Oh, the wind was pretty strong yesterday, and the head broke off. It took that tree down with it, too.




Security camera







Phoenix:
Hey, there's a camera here.
Gumshoe:
That's the security camera. It takes photos of people going to the studio. All you have to do is look at the data and you can see who went where!
Phoenix:
There's a number plate on the camera... [ST1-307]. That must be the camera ID number.




Studio One entrance







Phoenix:
The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.
Maya:
Let's go in and check it out, Nick! ... Hey! It's locked!
Phoenix:
Looks like you need a cardkey to get in. It makes sense that they would want to keep the non-employees out.




Welcome sign







Maya:
There's a big welcome sign above the path.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, apparently the studio's fallen on tough times. They've started letting people in on days they aren't filming. They make a bit of extra money by charging for admission.
Maya:
Huh. You sure know a lot about this place, Detective. You know, you could always quit being a detective and work here?
Phoenix:
Yeah! And what perfect timing, with the monkey's neck broken and all.
Gumshoe:
Huh? Just what's that supposed to mean, pal!?Talk









The investigation







Phoenix:
So, how is your investigation going, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Well, it's... Hey! I can't tell you that, pal.
Maya:
Nick... Maybe you need to be a little more indirect with your questions?
Phoenix:
Right. So, Detective, mind if I take a look at what you got?
Gumshoe:
What I got?
Phoenix:
The autopsy report! The latest version, if you please...
Gumshoe:
Hmm... right, right. Sorry about what happened last time, pal.
Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.




The investigation (subsequent times)







Phoenix:
So, how is your investigation going, Detective?
Gumshoe:
I'm not at liberty to give you any more information, pal. You'll hear all you need to know in court!
Phoenix:
(Oh well, it was worth a try.)




Reason for arrest







Phoenix:
Why was Mr. Powers arrested?
Gumshoe:
Simple, pal! The murder took place right over there in Studio One. Now, the victim entered Studio One at approximately 1:00 PM. At that time, there was no one other than the victim in the studio. According to the autopsy report, the time of death was 2:30 PM. Only one person went to the studio between 1:00 and 2:30! And that person was none other than Will Powers! No one else, pal! If you think I'm lying, ask the security lady at the main gate.
Maya:
Nick! If that's true...! Anyone would think that Powers did it with that kind of evidence!
Phoenix:
Thanks for cheering me up...




The security lady







Phoenix:
About the security lady...
Gumshoe:
Oh, that sweet old lady. What a charmer!
Phoenix:
Huh? A-are we talking about the same person?
Gumshoe:
When I showed her my badge she gave me a donut and some coffee!
Maya:
Remember what Powers said. She's a sucker for authority.
Gumshoe:
She even gave me a piece of valuable evidence!
Maya:
Whaat!?




Decisive evidence (appears after "The security lady")







Phoenix:
What kind of evidence!?
Gumshoe:
Well, that, er, photo. The photo of the Steel Samurai heading toward the scene of the crime!
Maya:
What! Who took that!?
Gumshoe:
See the camera up on that gate, pal?
Maya:
The gate? You mean the one with the welcome sign?
Gumshoe:
Yeah. Whenever someone walks by, that camera automatically snaps a photo of them!
Maya:
Oh no! Nick, he has evidence! We're finished!
Phoenix:
(Funny, for someone with hard proof he doesn't look too happy.)
Gumshoe:

Attorney's Badge







Phoenix:
Detective, see this? This is my attorney's badge.
Gumshoe:
Uh huh? Don'tcha think it's a little sad when you have to explain what your badge means, pal? Real men show their P.D. badge and that's that!
Phoenix:
I'll admit the design of my badge leaves a lot to be desired...
Maya:
Maybe it should just be a big "L" for "Lawyer"?
Phoenix:
Hmm... I'm not so sure about that.




Anything else







Phoenix:
Um, Detective. Any ideas about this?
Gumshoe:
Look, I don't got time to look at every little trinket you got, okay pal?After clearing "The investigation" and "Decisive evidence" Talk options:Gumshoe:

Sure thing, pal. Go wherever you like. Of course, you're not going to find any clues I haven't already found! Hah hah hah!Phoenix:

Yeah, and they're soft enough she doesn't need teeth to chew them...Oldbag:
Hey, you! Well? Are you satisfied Powers is guilty yet?Phoenix:
(Urk! She had to make my life harder by giving that photo to Detective Gumshoe...)Talk









Photographic proof







Phoenix:
Why didn't you tell us about the security photo, ma'am?
Oldbag:
Hmm? Oh, that? I just thought it would be more thrilling to talk with the detective himself! These things are important, you know. Oh, just to the left from here is the gate with the camera that took that photo. It's my job to check the photos every day, you see.




Reason for suspicion







Oldbag:
This guard station is in a central position. No matter where you go here, you pass by my station first! Now poor Hammer, he went to the studio just before 1:00. The murder happened right around 2:30, see? The only one I seen go through here between 1:00 and 2:30 was Powers himself! The security camera got a good look at him too. If he's not the one what did it, I don't know who is!
Phoenix:
Maybe... it was you?
Oldbag:
Gyah hah ha hah! Good one, sonny.
Phoenix:
(She thinks I was joking.)




Mr. Hammer







Phoenix:
Was the victim, Mr. Hammer, a popular actor?
Oldbag:
Oh, he was the biggest star in the studio!
Phoenix:
("Was"? Past tense?)
Maya:
Oh yes! He was great as the "Bearded Samurai"!
Oldbag:
That too, yes. He shone the brightest! Back in the day. Making a star like him play the "Evil Magistrate"... It's a disgrace, I tell you! Hammer took it pretty hard, and who can blame him?




Automatic camera (appears after "Photographic proof")







Phoenix:
About the security camera...
Oldbag:
Oh yes, the camera. It's automatic. It can tell when someone walks through that gate, see? Then it snaps a photo! Apparently, it records the time when it takes a picture too. But I don't bother myself with those details. I just view all the photos on the computer over in the security guard station. I check 'em every day before going home, I do.October 16Wright & Co. Law OfficesMaya:
What's going on, Nick!? Powers said he was sleeping in his dressing room! But now there's a photo of him going to the studio!?Phoenix:
Don't look at me! How should I know?Talk









What to do







Phoenix:
What do you think?
Maya:
That photo the detective was talking about is the problem here.
Phoenix:
Well, that's hard to say, without seeing the actual photo ourselves. But if it is Powers in that photo, his alibi is shot.




Photographic proof







Phoenix:
Only one person went to the scene of the crime before the murder took place. And there's a photograph to prove it.
Maya:
I guess it makes sense that that person is the killer then. What do we do, Nick?
Phoenix:
Maybe there was someone else who could have gone to the scene other than Powers? Let's take a look. Maybe that security lady missed someone?
Maya:
On thing's for sure, if there are any clues, they'll be in that studio.October 16Detention CenterVisitor's RoomPhoenix:

Bicycle







Phoenix:
Looks like one of those electric-powered bicycles. I dunno about these. I mean, what's the point?
Maya:
It makes it a lot easier to go up hills!
Phoenix:
Don't people cycle to get exercise!?




Drain grate







Phoenix:
The metal grate on the drain here has been taken off. That's a pretty big drain. A kid could fit through there, I bet.
Maya:
Yeah, if you snuck in that way you wouldn't have to pay at the gate!
Phoenix:
Well, if you want to leave that way, be my guest.
Maya:
Right! Huh? Hey! I'm not a kid!




Grate







Phoenix:
The grate that used to cover the drain. It's a little bent. I don't think it would fit if I tried to put it back on.




Lunch table







Phoenix:
The remains of yesterday's lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak.
Maya:
Mmm! T-bone steak! That would have hit the spot.
Phoenix:
You just had a burger!
Maya:
Yeah, but I have a second stomach just for steaks.

Stage backdrop







Phoenix:
There's a half-finished backdrop for a stage here. Looks like a castle. Probably "Neo Olde Tokyo Castle."




Dressing room door







Phoenix:
The door to the dressing room. It's not locked.
Maya:
Hey, Nick! Let's take a look inside! Maybe we can find something as a souvenir...?
Phoenix:
What do you mean "find"!?
Maya:
You never know! There might be something like... the Samurai Spear!
Phoenix:
We don't need a spear! (And that's the murder weapon for crying out loud!)




Dressing room sign







Phoenix:
There's a sign on the dressing room door. "Mr. Will Powers"... it must be neat to be the star and have your own room like this.




Dressing room window







Phoenix:
A window into the dressing room. The glass is frosted, so I can't see inside.




Storage room door







Phoenix:
That must be the storage room. That's where they keep all the film equipment.
Maya:
Wow, Nick! You know a lot about the industry!
Phoenix:
Umm, what else would they keep in a film studio?

Phoenix:
They always have mirrors like this in dressing rooms. I see my hair is still nice and spiky, just how I like it.




Bag

Hmm? This must be Powers's bag.
Phoenix:
Hey, don't open that.

Well, lighting is fine, but I'd want to be the director. Or maybe the Steel Samurai!

Tape outline







Phoenix:
They outlined where Jack Hammer's body lay with tape. His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. I guess that's why the head part looks like a helmet. Funny, I expected a spear stabbing would leave at least a few bloodstains. I guess the costume must have absorbed most of it...Maya:
Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!Phoenix:

In the morning we went through the action sequences in the employee area. WP and Hammer were there, along with everyone else.
Phoenix:
The employee area--that's where Powers's dressing room is, right?

Well, Nick? This is our chance to do what we can without her looking over our shoulders!Examine









Computer







Phoenix:
The computer that runs the studio security cameras.
Maya:
Nick! Maybe we can see that photo of Powers with this computer!
Phoenix:
Yeah, maybe. (Should I try the computer?)



Try it







Phoenix:
Okay. Let's give it a try.
Maya:
You know how to work these things, Nick?
Phoenix:
Looks like I just have to enter in a few numbers. Let's see... first, I need the date of the murder. (It looks like the camera turned on at 1:00 PM that day... 1:00... That was when the security lady arrived at the guard station.)
[Please enter the number of the security camera.]



ST1-703







Phoenix:
There! Entered!
Maya:
... ... Nothing happened.
Phoenix:
Huh? Maybe I got the number wrong.
Maya:
*sigh* Maybe we should go look at that camera again?

Let's see what we got... ... Huh?Maya:
How is this a picture of Will Powers?Phoenix:
Well, he is the one who always wears that suit... I guess that's why the security lady thought it was him.Maya:
I don't imagine the detective was very happy with this photo as evidence. Hmm? Something's printed on the back.Phoenix:
Huh? [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2]Maya:
What does that mean?Phoenix:
Maybe there's more photo data from that day?Maya:
Nope--that's the only one in the computer.Powers's{?} Photo added to the Court Record.Maya:
Hey, hey, Nick! Can't we use this photo as evidence for the trial?Phoenix:
Yeah.Maya:
We'll put that security lady in her place with this!Phoenix:
Right, we'll put her in her place...Maya:
Hey, that's what I said! Anyway... Let's show her this photo and see what she says!Phoenix:
Wait. Let's not.Maya:
Why not?Phoenix:
It's never a good idea to reveal your hand to the enemy too soon.Maya:
Nick! You're craftier than I gave you credit for. Why, you could be the next... Evil Magistrate!Phoenix:
Hey! Why do I have to be the villain.Maya:
Relax, it was just a joke! So, are we done for today?Phoenix:
I think this photo is what we needed for the trial. Still, it'd be better if we had some idea who the real killer was! Maybe it really is that security lady...?To be continued.Before selecting "ST1-307" upon examining computer in Global Studios - Main Gate:October 16Studio OneMaya:

Part 6October 18, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:
Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth:
The prosecution will show the court that at 2:30 PM on October 15, the defendant, Mr. Will Powers, killed fellow actor Jack Hammer at Studio One of Global Studios. It is impossible for anyone else to have committed this heinous crime. The evidence presented during the trial will all point to this fact.Judge:
Hmm. I see. Very well, I would like to move on to your testimony. Mr. Edgeworth, the prosecution may call its first witness.Edgeworth:
Very well, I call a most familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand. (Changed from [First, I would like to call a familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand.] in the original release)Edgeworth:
Detective, if you would briefly describe this case to the court?Gumshoe:
Yes sir! I'll explain with the guidemap here. To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see? This here is the Employee Area. The actors did a run-through of their action scenes during the morning here. This is the main gate to the studios. The security lady that works at the studios was here at 1:00 PM on that day. Past the security station there is a gate, see? Past that are the studios. And here it is... Studio One. This is the scene of the murder, where the body was found! Now, on the day of the murder, October 15, there were only three people here. The victim, Jack Hammer, the defendant, Will Powers, and a young woman, the production assistant. All the production staff were in the Employee Area until noon. Then after lunch, the victim, Jack Hammer, went to Studio One. Right after that, at 1:00 PM, the security lady got to the guard station. Now, jump ahead to later that day... 5:00 PM. The production staff came to Studio One to perform a rehearsal. Needless to say, the rehearsal was cancelled... The time of death was 2:30 PM. The "Samurai Spear" found lodged in the victim's chest was the murder weapon. That's the case, in brief. Anyone like to hear that again?Phoenix:
(Hmm... should I listen to that whole thing again...?)Skip it







Leads to:
"I think I can probably remember that..."Listen again







Phoenix:
I'm sorry, could you describe that one more time?
Gumshoe:
I shoulda known it would be you, pal! Fine. Once more for the mentally-challenged lawyer.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, yeah. Live it up while you can, Gumshoe.)
Leads back to:
"To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see?"Phoenix:
(I think I can probably remember that...)Judge:
So the murder weapon was a "spear"? How... medieval!Samurai Spear added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:
Your Honor. This case is quite simple if you ask one question: And that question is: "What did the security lady at the guard station see?"Judge:
Understood.Edgeworth:
Let's call this security officer to the stand!Edgeworth:
Will the witness declare her name?Oldbag:
... Hmm? My, aren't you a handsome fellow! I'm afraid I'm a bit flustered!Edgeworth:
Y-your name, please!Oldbag:
Oh, dearie! No need for you to be embarrassed! Just call me "grandma."Edgeworth:
YOUR NAME, PLEASE!Phoenix:
(Seems Edgeworth has a bit of trouble getting his witnesses to say their names...)Oldbag:
Wendy Oldbag, dearie. So just call me "grandma." It's practically my name! So even when I was young I was an Oldbag, but not really that was just my name dearie. Still how the other children would make fun of me and just because of my name can you believe it? But there was this boy, the captain of the chess club in junior high, and when he called me an old bag well I just cried and cried because I had a crush on him you see--Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
O-objection! I... object to the witness's talkativeness.Judge:
Objection sustained! The witness will refrain from rambling on the stand.Oldbag:
I was just getting to the good part, dearie!Edgeworth:
Perhaps we can get to the testimony?Judge:
Now, the witness was stationed at the main gate on the day of the murder, correct?Oldbag:
Yessey I was.Judge:
And to get to the scene of the murder, someone would have to pass by you?Oldbag:
You know your stuff, dearie!Judge:
... You may begin your testimony.Phoenix:
(She sure is one hell of an Oldbag...)Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Oldbag:
On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.
Poor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.
I, well, I had some errands to run that morning.
Anyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.
I was at the main gate from then until 5:00!
Now, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?
Interesting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.
It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!Judge:
You saw the defendant, then? Hmm... Very well. Let's begin the cross-examination. Mr. Wright?Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.Cross Examination-- Witness's Account --Oldbag:
On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So up until that time, anyone who wanted to could go into the studio?
Oldbag:
Well, there wasn't a security guard at the gate, no. But the main gate was locked, dearie. You'd need an employee cardkey to get in.
Phoenix:
(Right... the cardkey that I have. So, what she's saying is no one who wasn't supposed to be there could get in.)
Edgeworth:
Was there anyone at the studios when you arrived at the guard station?Oldbag:
Poor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
A "run-through"...?
Oldbag:
They were working out a scene between the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate. They got the basics figured out by noon, and were to use the afternoon for practice. Rehearsal was supposed to start at 5:00. That's why poor old Hammer went to Studio One in the afternoon.
Phoenix:
(So Powers was in his dressing room sleeping... when he was supposed to be practicing! Talk about a laid-back hero...)
Edgeworth:
If there was a run-through in the morning, why did you only get there after noon?Oldbag:
I, well, I had some errands to run that morning.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What kind of "errands"?
Oldbag:
Oh, well, you know.
Phoenix:
Answer the question!
Oldbag:
Actually... I was watching poor Hammer and Powers. Observing, you know?
Phoenix:
O-observing? Weren't you supposed to be at the guard station?
Oldbag:
Whippersnapper! I told you I locked the gate, didn't I? I did my job!
Phoenix:
(I'm not sure your boss would see it that way...)
Oldbag:
Anyway! I always watch Hammer's run-throughts. Always! Never missed one in all my years.
Maya:
Wow! I want to see a Steel Samurai run-through too!
Phoenix:
You could quit being a spirit medium and take up guard duty.
Maya:
Not a bad idea...Oldbag:
Anyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Did you see the victim then?
Oldbag:
Did I see poor old Hammer? Nope. He'd already gone to the studio before I got back to the guard station.
Edgeworth:
Tell us what happened next.Oldbag:
I was at the main gate from then until 5:00!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So you were watching there the WHOLE time? No breaks? Not even a second?
Oldbag:
O-of course! I am a professional, you know! Our are you criticizing how I do my job!? Whippersnapper!
Phoenix:
No, it's just, after seeing you eating those donuts in the guard station yesterday...
Oldbag:
I can watch the gate and eat donuts at the same time! Snipperwhapper!
Maya:
"Snipperwhapper"...? Old windbag is losing it, Nick.
Phoenix:
Why don't you raise an objection?
Judge:
So, the witness was on duty through the afternoon, the whole time. Very well. What did you see?Oldbag:
Now, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
How did you know that?
Oldbag:
Oh hoh hoh. I have my ways! That over-dressed young detective told me. I fed him some donuts and he talked and talked... If you ask me, that detective isn't cut out for his job.
Edgeworth:

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
2:00? You're sure?
Oldbag:
Sure as spit!
Judge:
Well, who was the man!?

Nick... Doesn't she seem like she's enjoying this a little too much?Phoenix:
Windbags love gossiping about other people's misfortunes.Maya:
Ugh. Can't she get her kicks somewhere else?Phoenix:
Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag! You've been saying since yesterday that you "saw Mr. Powers," correct? But you're talking about the man in this photo, aren't you!Judge:
J-just a moment, Mr. Wright. Let me see that photo! ... What is this, exactly?Phoenix:
None other than the Steel Samurai, defender of Neo Olde Tokyo. Ms. Oldbag! Is this the "Mr. Powers" that you saw!?Oldbag:
Of course! Didn't your momma teach you any sense, sonny? Anyone can plainly see that's Powers! Right?Edgeworth:
No, they can't! (Changed from [Um, yeah.] in the original release) ... Umm... well. I mean, I wonder? (Changed from [Umm... well. I wonder?] in the original release)Phoenix:
True, Mr. Powers does play the role of the Steel Samurai! But that doesn't mean Mr. Powers IS the Steel Samurai!Oldbag:
...! I... I know that! I wasn't born yesterday!Judge:
No one in this court is accusing you of that, Ms... er, witness.Phoenix:
(He's having trouble calling her "Oldbag" apparently...)Judge:
However, you do not have proof that the person in this photo is Mr. Will Powers, do you?Oldbag:
Humph! Nosy old man! Of course I have proof!Phoenix:
What!?Edgeworth:
Huh!?Phoenix:
(Even Edgeworth is surprised!?)Edgeworth:
The prosecution would like to ask the old... the witness. Please make known all the information in your possession ahead of time!Oldbag:
How was I to know everyone would be so nosy! You should be ashamed, all of you! Anyway, I showed that photo to the young detective. He told me "this isn't any good as evidence, pal." He didn't even give it a second look!Edgeworth:
...Phoenix:
(Wow, old windbag has left even Edgeworth speechless. She's good!)Judge:
Let's hear about your proof, then.Witness Testimony-- The Man in the Photo --Oldbag:
I never say anything I don't mean, mind you!
That morning, during the run-through of the action scene...
I saw Powers trip and fall!
He broke one of the props, it was a big mess.
Apparently, he sprained his ankle pretty bad.
Now, look at that picture!
You can see he's dragging his leg! See? Clear as day!
That's how I knew it was Powers. Happy?Judge:
Hmm. So he had sprained his ankle...? Very well. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.Phoenix:

That morning, during the run-through of the action scene...Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Who was present at the run-through?
Oldbag:
Well, let's see... There was Powers, he's the Steel Samurai... Then poor old Hammer, the Evil Magistrate. And... me.
Judge:
And what exactly were you doing?
Oldbag:
Observing! Just... observing.
Phoenix:
What about the assistant?
Oldbag:
Oh, she was off moving backdrops around and such.
Phoenix:
(So she didn't see the run-through, then...)Oldbag:
I saw Powers trip and fall!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
"Trip and fall"...?
Oldbag:
Yes! And to think, he's supposed to be the Steel Samurai! What a laugh! So Powers sprained his ankle. I helped make it better for him, of course.
Judge:
You... helped make it better?
Oldbag:
I kissed it where it hurt.
Judge:
L-let's just skip over that part, shall we?
Phoenix:
Where was the assistant then?
Oldbag:
Oh, her? She was cleaning up backdrops, I think. She didn't know about Powers's ankle.
Phoenix:
(Hmm...)
Edgeworth:
You may continue your testimony.Oldbag:
He broke one of the props, it was a big mess.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
He broke a prop?
Oldbag:
Sure did! His own Samurai Spear.

That's how I knew it was Powers. Happy?Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Still, you can't look at this and say it's Mr. Powers!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Yes, but only Mr. Powers would have been dragging his leg!
Judge:
He has a point. It does seem quite likely that it was Powers.
Phoenix:
(There's got to be more to this. I'd better keep pressing her.)Maya:
Well, Nick? Find any glaring contradictions?Phoenix:
Well, she seems pretty sure that was Powers in that photo... I guess I'll just press her and see if I can shake her conviction...After pressing second or third statement, then pressing fourth statement:Edgeworth:
I think we've heard enough! Haven't we, Your Honor?Judge:
Well, there is one thing that bothers me.Edgeworth:
Which is?Judge:
Where is this "Steel Samurai" costume now?Edgeworth:
Umm... hmm. Actually, well... We couldn't find it. We're looking, though.Judge:
Hmm...Edgeworth:
Anyway, that's not important! The witness did see the Steel Samurai, yes. And it is clear that the person in the Steel Samurai suit was Mr. Will Powers!Judge:
Hmm... I suppose that's right.Phoenix:
(Are you sure you're sure, Your Honor?)Object







Phoenix:
Hold it right there! We keep talking possibilities, but we have to agree that this photo shows the Steel Samurai! Nowhere in this photo can we see Mr. Will Powers!
Judge:
Hmm... The defense has a point. I also wonder if someone else not caught on camera could have killed Mr. Hammer. We have to consider that possibility, also.
Edgeworth:
Then allow me to remove that doubt from your mind, Your Honor...
Leads to:
"Will the witness continue her testimony, please?"Wait and see what happens







Phoenix:
(I think I'll wait and see where this goes.)
Judge:
I suppose, since there weren't any additional crew members at the studios that day... It's quite likely that it was the defendant inside that costume. I see no problem with this evidence.
Edgeworth:
Most perceptive, Your Honor!

Right... Anyway! It's also true that the computer in the guard station records all security cam data.Oldbag:
Ooh! You know, if you wanted to work at the studio, we might have an opening.Phoenix:
That very computer printed out this photo. Note that on the back of the photo are printed the words: [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2]Oldbag:
Even I know that means it was taken at 2:00 PM on October the 15th! Really, sonny!Phoenix:
Actually, I knew that too. The issure here is the bit at the end where it says: "Photo #2"...Oldbag:
"Photo #2"...?Phoenix:
The computer only held data for one photo on that day. Don't you think that's odd? Shouldn't this photo be "Photo #1" if it really was the ONLY photo!?Judge:
Order! Order! Please tell the court what you mean by this, Mr. Wright!Phoenix:
Actually, that's what I want to ask the witness. This evidence shows that not one, but two people went to the studio that day. Yet there is only data for one of the photos! Who could have erased the data for the other photo? Only someone with access-- the security lady herself!

K-kids!? So, on the photo that you erased...?Oldbag:
It was a boy. Probably 2nd or 3rd grade.Phoenix:
Whaaaaaaaaaaaat!?Judge:
O-order! Order! Let me get this straight. You saw two people pass by the gate on their way to the studios that day? One was the Steel Samurai, dragging his leg. The other was a boy who looked to be in about 2nd or 3rd grade?Oldbag:
Oh yes, well we see his type there every day. Can't stop 'em. Can't catch 'em.Edgeworth:
A boy in 2nd or 3rd grade? Hmm... I assume it would be hard, if not impossible for a young boy to wield the Samurai Spear?Judge:
Impossible, I'd think. It's quite heavy.Oldbag:
Right! As I said, I didn't pay him much mind. That's why I erased the data.Maya:
Um, Nick? What's going on? I mean, the boy was there, that makes him a suspect!Phoenix:
Yeah, and they're already trying to "un-suspect" him.Judge:
This court will take a five-minute recess. (Changed from [I'd like to take a five minute recess.] in the original release) I want the defense and the prosecution to consider this new information... And no forgetting vital information this time!October 18, 11:08 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3Phoenix:
Mr. WP?Will:
Y-yes?Phoenix:
Tell me straight: were you really in your dressing room? You didn't go to the studio?Will:
I-I didn't go to the studio! I was s-sleeping, honest.Maya:
So who was the "Steel Samurai" in that security photo?Will:
How should I know? The Steel Samurai costume was off in the corner of the dressing room. Anyone could have walked in and taken it, really.Maya:
What!? You should take better care of that stuff!Will:
I couldn't imagine anyone would want to steal a Steel Samurai costume! So... where does this leave me?Phoenix:
It doesn't look good...Will:
*sniff*Phoenix:
You're the only likely suspect, right now.Maya:
Nick! W-what are we going to do!?Phoenix:
First, we play for more time. We'll start targeting someone else that could conceivably have done this!Maya:
Right! And it'll take them so long to shoot us down that we can get another day!Phoenix:
Right... but if we pick the wrong person, we might lose on the spot.Will:
You... don't sound very optimistic.Phoenix:
I'm not optimistic at all, actually.Maya:
Hey, Nick. It's time.Phoenix:
Okay. Let's go. *sigh*Will:
What does that mean... Please don't sigh like that! *sniff*Judge:
Court will now reconvene for the trial of Mr. Will Powers. (Changed from [The court will now reconvene for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.] in the original release) Mr. Edgeworth, will you present the prosecution's thoughts on this matter?Edgeworth:
The prosecution's thoughts are simple. Nothing has changed. The other person who went to the studios was a boy of roughly 10 years of age. The photo we do have may not be hard evidence... But there is still no one else that could have committed this crime! I call for a verdict of "guilty" for the defendant, Mr. Will Powers!Judge:
Hmm... Very well. Mr. Wright, your thoughts?Phoenix:
The defense disagrees with the prosecution's claim. There IS another person who could have committed this crime!Judge:
Order! Interesting... Let us hear who you have in mind! However... Be aware that this court does not look kindly on accusing the innocent. If you accuse someone who is obviously innocent, you will be penalized.Phoenix:
(Right. Great. As if the stakes weren't high enough.)Judge:
So, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder?The assistant girl







Phoenix:
It was the assistant! The Steel Samurai costume was in his dressing room. She stole it, and in doing so she became the Steel Samurai!
Judge:
So you're saying the Steel Samurai in the picture is really the assistant?
Phoenix:
That's correct, Your Honor!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
If you're serious, you've got guts, Mr. Wright. Remember the photo? Wasn't the Steel Samurai a little lame!? He was dragging his foot!
Phoenix:
Oh. (Uh oh. Bad feeling time.)
Edgeworth:
Remember the testimony concerning Powers's injury!!!


Oldbag:
Powers and poor Hammer were at the run-through. Oh, and me.
Phoenix:
What about the assistant?
Oldbag:
Oh, her? She was cleaning up backdrops, I think. She didn't know about Powers's ankle.


Edgeworth:
The assistant knew nothing of Mr. Power's injury! She could look the Steel Samurai look with that costume... But she couldn't walk the the Steel Samurai walk! She wouldn't have limped!
Phoenix:
Ungh!
Maya:
That kind of takes the legs out from under that case...
Judge:
Mr. Wright. I'm afraid I have to penalize you, as I warned.
Phoenix:
(Nobody knows... the trouble I've seen...)
Judge:
May we move on, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
(Grr... this fight isn't over yet!) If you would, Your Honor, one more chance, please.
Judge:
Very well. Go ahead.
Leads back to:
"So, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder?"The grade-school boy







Phoenix:
It was the grade-school boy! ... ... ... Why isn't anyone saying anything?
Edgeworth:
Bah! Are you seriously suggesting the boy did it, Mr. Wright!? "Grade-school boy kills veteran action star with spear!" For one thing, it was the Steel Samurai holding the murder weapon. Would you care to explain just how the boy was involved?
Phoenix:
(Hmm... maybe that was a dumb move on my part.)
Maya:
"Maybe"? "Maybe"!? How about "absolutely," Nick!
Judge:
Mr. Wright. I'm afraid I have to penalize you, as I warned.
Phoenix:
(Nobody knows... the trouble I've seen...)
Judge:
May we move on, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
(Grr... this fight isn't over yet!) If you would, Your Honor, one more chance, please.
Judge:
Very well. Go ahead.
Leads back to:
"So, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder?"The security lady







Leads to:
"It was the security lady! Wendy Oldbag!"Phoenix:
It was the security lady! Wendy Oldbag!Oldbag:
W-who!?Phoenix:
The Steel Samurai is dragging his leg in this picture. That means whoever was in the suit knew about that morning's injury. Maybe because... they had been watching the action scene run-through! There was only one person other than Powers and Hammer who knew about the injury. The security lady, Oldbag!Oldbag:
W-what!? Whippersnapper!Judge:
Order! Order! I-is this true, Oldbag!?Oldbag:
Oldbag!? That's Ms. Oldbag to you!Phoenix:
Ms. Oldbag was standing guard alone at the main gate. She was by herself... in other words, she has no alibi! She could have briefly left her post to steal the the Steel Samurai costume... Then slipped into Studio One, the scene of the murder!Judge:
W-why would she go through the trouble of wearing the Steel Samurai costume!?Phoenix:
Simple, Your Honor. She knew the camera at the gate would take her picture. If she was in his costume, she could point the finger at Mr. Powers!Judge:
I see! Excellent deductive reasoning, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:
(Ohhh yeah, right here! Sherlock Holmes II, baby!) ...? (That's odd. Isn't this the part where Edgeworth pounces...? Doesn't he usually jump up with an objection and some new damning evidence...?)Judge:
Well, Mr. Edgeworth? Does the prosecution have an opinion on this matter?Edgeworth:
... The prosecution has no meaningful objections at this time.Oldbag:
W-w-what!? What's that supposed to mean!? Oh, so you all think I did it? Is that it!? Edgey-boy! Don't just sit there, do something!Phoenix:
(What's my move? Maybe now's my chance to take this the whole way?)Press further







Leads to:
"The very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case..."Give granny a break







Phoenix:
(I guess this does kind of make it look like she's the killer. Funny, I feel bad for her all of a sudden.)
Judge:
Hmm... It's true that the witness could conceivably have committed this crime. Yet we must not forget that the victim was an action hero. As formidable as her personality may be, I doubt she'd be strong enough.
Phoenix:
(Uh oh! If he removes her from consideration, that means Mr. Powers is it! Sorry, windbag... but I don't have a choice.)
Leads to:
"The very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case..."Phoenix:
The very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case... can be used to cast doubt on Ms. Oldbag's actions on that day!Oldbag:
B-but why would I do something so horrible to poor Hammer!?Phoenix:
You forget that Mr. Powers lacks a clear motive, too.Judge:
Hmm... Indeed.Phoenix:
(That did it. Now windbag is one of the suspects. No hard feelings... I hope.)Oldbag:
Wait just a minute! What about the other person who went to the studio!? The boy! The one whose photo I erased!Judge:
He's only a grade schooler though, as you said. 2nd or 3rd grade, was it?Oldbag:
Th-that doesn't matter! When I was that age, I could pin my old man in 10 seconds, tops!Judge:
Hmm... Your thoughts, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:
That boy is not the killer.Oldbag:
What!? How can you be so sure! Oh, or is it be nice to the kids and mean to your elders day? Whippersnapper!Phoenix:
I have proof.Oldbag:
P-proof!?Judge:
Indeed? Then let's see this proof, Mr. Wright. You have proof that shows the boy could not have committed this murder?Present Cardkey







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
The scene of the murder, as we all know, was Studio One. However, you need a cardkey to enter Studio One! How could a boy with no formal relation to the studios have a cardkey!?
Leads to:
"I see!"Present Powers's(?) Photo or Samurai Spear







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Your Honor! The murder weapon was the Samurai Spear. That very spear is shown here in this photo. How could the boy have taken the spear? It's impossible!
Leads to:
"I see!"Present anything else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
This is my proof!
Judge:
... I can't see how that has anything to do with this matter, Mr. Wright? Mr. Wright. There aren't that many pieces of evidence in the Court Record. Please try not to pick the wrong ones!
Phoenix:
S-sorry, Your Honor.
Judge:
I'll ask again, Mr. Wright.
Leads back to:
"You have proof that shows the boy could not have committed this murder?"Judge:
I see! Well, would the witness care to comment on this?Oldbag:
Mrph.Phoenix:
(The windbag... speechless. This has got to be a first.)Judge:
Very well! This court will suspend proceedings on the current trial for today. Mr. Edgeworth, please find out more about your witness, Ms. Windy... what was her name?Edgeworth:
Something "Oldbag," Your Honor.Judge:
Then the prosecution will look further into this Oldbag before we continue! That is all. The court is adjourned!Oldbag:
W-wait a second! I'm not going to just sit here while you run off barking up the wrong tree... me! I'm talking!Maya:
Oh, great, stop the presses! The windbag wants to talk!Judge:
Ms. Oldbag! What is this all about? Have you omitted something from your testimony?Oldbag:
Actually, if you must know, there's something I was told not to talk about.Phoenix:
N-not to talk about?Edgeworth:
By whom!?Phoenix:
(Huh? You mean it wasn't Edgeworth who told her not to talk...?)Judge:

Oldbag:
Yes, well, I was surprised no one asked about it.
Phoenix:
So, where were these people?
Oldbag:
The director was in the Employee Area all morning for the run-through. He joined the producer around lunchtime and they had a meeting after that.
Edgeworth:
Where!
Oldbag:
Oh, in the Studio Two trailer.

Whew, what a day.Maya:
This is no time for relaxing, Nick! Say, you think WP's got a chance?Phoenix:
I guess that really depends on the people we found out about in today's trial.Maya:
The director and producer...?Phoenix:
Yeah, them.Maya:
Well, what are we doing here then!? Let's get to the studios!Talk









What to do







Phoenix:
What do you think we should do?
Maya:
W-what do I... huh!? Why don't we do what you just said!? We gotta get the scoop on this director and producer.
Phoenix:
Oh, right. Then there's no point hanging out here.
Maya:
That's what I've been saying! Let's get to those studios pronto!




Any ideas







Maya:
Hmm. We don't have enough information to make a case yet.
Phoenix:
That's exactly the same thing you said yesterday! Just admit it: you don't have a clue what happened.
Maya:
There's not enough information!Present









Attorney's Badge







Phoenix:
Hey, see this?
Maya:
You... really like showing that off, don't you, Nick?




Cardkey







Maya:
Hey, you still have that! Great!
Phoenix:
Well, we couldn't get into the scene of the murder without it. And its owner isn't missing it in his detention cell...
Maya:
Poor old WP...




Powers's(?) Photo







Maya:
You know, what if this really was Mr. Powers?
Phoenix:
Yeah. It's hard to say. We don't really know anyone else it could be. I seriously doubt it was that old windbag.
Maya:
So Mr. Powers is... lying?
Phoenix:
He really doesn't seem the type, does he. (Curiouser and curiouser...)




Samurai Spear







Maya:
I wish I had my own Samurai Spear! You'd by my own personal pincushion, Nick!
Phoenix:
Me!? Why me!?




Anything else







Maya:
Sorry, I don't know how that will help us figure this out.October 18Detention CenterVisitor's RoomWill:
Oh, Mr. Wright! Thank you for earlier.Phoenix:
Not at all. We got lucky, to tell the truth.Maya:
You can say that again!Phoenix:
Let's not.Maya:
So, WP! Do you have any leads that might get us going in the right direction?Will:
Hmm... S-sorry, but no.Maya:
Be sure to tell us anything that comes to mind, no matter how small.Phoenix:
We can't rely on getting lucky again tomorrow.Will:
Y-yes... *sniff*Examine









Security guard







Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room.Talk









The fanboy







Phoenix:
Do, er, "fanboys" sneak into the studios often?
Will:
No, not that I know of. That security lady's pretty strict with them.
Maya:
But, in today's testimony, didn't she say they were often hanging around?
Will:
The kids really, really love the Steel Samurai. They sneak past when she's not looking, I guess.




The director







Phoenix:
Was the director present at the morning run-through?
Will:
Y-yes, yes he was. He was directing how the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate should move.
Maya:
Why didn't you tell us that before!?
Will:
W-well, just, the studio asked us to keep quiet...
Maya:
That has nothing to do with this! I hate to repeat myself, but Nick here is a newbie lawyer! Fresh off the bar! When he loses, he's going to lose big!
Will:
I... I see. *sniff*
Phoenix:
(Whose side is she on!?)
Maya:
You aren't hiding anything else from us, are you!?
Will:
N-no, I sure hope not.Present









Cardkey







Phoenix:
We found this cardkey in your dressing room.
Will:
Oh, that's mine, yes.
Maya:
Can people outside the studios get these cards?
Will:
I don't think so. Even I have to return the card. Once the show's done filming, that is.
Maya:
Huh...




Powers's(?) Photo







Phoenix:
Regarding this photograph...
Will:
Y-yes...?
Phoenix:
This really, truly, absolutely isn't you, right?
Will:
R-right. *sniff* I was sleeping in my dressing room the whole time, honest.
Phoenix:
But who else could have worn it!?
Maya:
Your costume was in your dressing room?
Will:
Yes. I guess they snuck in and took it while I was asleep.
Phoenix:
(But who!?)




Samurai Spear







Phoenix:
Regarding the murder weapon...
Will:
Yes?
Phoenix:
Is it heavy, that spear?
Will:
It's pretty hefty, yeah. I don't think the average person would be able to swing it around effectively.
Phoenix:
Hmm...
Maya:
And... that's the spear that broke or something during the morning run-through?
Will:
Oh yes, I goofed on a round kick, you see... I broke the spear. The security lady fixed it for me right away though.
Maya:
With duct tape. We heard.




Anything else







Will:
E-excuse me. Thank you for showing me that, whatever it is. I wish I could think of some way I could help you... S-sorry. *sniff*October 18, 2:16 PMGlobal StudiosMain GateMaya:
No one's here.Phoenix:
Right, now that they have Ms. Oldbag in custody. I guess they don't have anyone else to replace her...Maya:
H-hey! In the guard station! Look! She left her donuts! ... ... What? I wasn't going to eat them!Examine









Computer







Phoenix:
The computer that runs the studio security cameras. Huh? It looks like it's been turned off for the day.




Guard station







Phoenix:
The security guard station. Ms. Oldbag must like junk food. There's a mountain of it on the desk in there.




Main gate







Phoenix:
The main entrance to the studios. They probably have a police officer on patrol out there.October 18Studio One EntranceMaya:
Hey, Nick. It looks like Detective Gumshoe isn't here today.Phoenix:
You're right. He's probably up to his neck in paperwork after the commotion at today's trial.Maya:
So, Nick... Remember that "Studio Two" we heard about at the trial today? It was down that path with the fallen tree, right?Phoenix:
Yeah, I think that's what they said.Maya:
Maybe the director and the rest of them are there today? Now's our chance, Nick! Let's check it out!Examine









Bench







Phoenix:
I'm bushed. Maybe I'll sit down here for a bit.
Maya:
This is exactly why I don't want to get old, ever.
Phoenix:
H-hey! I'm still young! I'm just tired!
Maya:
Nick, when you start having to say "I'm still young," you know it's all over.
Phoenix:
(But... but I AM still young!)




Left path







Phoenix:
In the trial, they said Studio Two was down this path. The monkey head is in the way, but we should be able to get by it without a problem.
Maya:
This monkey head is real heavy!
Phoenix:
Well, it did knock that tree over when it fell.
Maya:
Both of these, the monkey head and the tree, fell the day of the murder, didn't they.
Phoenix:
Yeah, that's what Detective Gumshoe said.




Statue with broken head







Phoenix:
The studio mascot. Apparently it's a monkey of some kind. I've never seen a monkey with a nose like that before!
Maya:
Why don't they put his head back on? Maybe we should ask that assistant?
Phoenix:
I'm not sure we really want her fixing anything. And you'd probably need a crane to move that thing.
Maya:
Probably so.




Security camera







Phoenix:
That's the security camera that automatically takes pictures of people here. It took two pictures on the day of the murder, before the actual time of death. One of them was the Steel Samurai. The other was a grade school boy. It doesn't seem to be switched on today.




Studio One entrance







Phoenix:
The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.




Welcome sign







Maya:
It says "Welcome."
Phoenix:
They let people in here when they're not filming, right?
Maya:
Nick! Let's come here some day! Whaddya say?
Phoenix:
Sure, if that security lady lets us in.October 18Studio OneMaya:
I... don't really want to be in here.Phoenix:
Yeah... It is a murder scene.Maya:
I want to go someplace else. Nick?Phoenix:

Film camera







Maya:
Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!
Phoenix:
Yeah! So don't touch it!
Maya:
Hey, smile, Nick, you're a star!
Phoenix:
S-stop that!




Reflecting screen







Phoenix:
That's for reflecting light. They call it a reflecting screen or something like that.
Maya:
Huh.
Phoenix:
What? Where's your enthusiasm for all things entertainment?
Maya:
Well, lighting is fine, but I'd want to be the director. Or maybe the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
(I think she's being serious...!)




Stage backdrop







Phoenix:
Looks like a backdrop for a stage. This must be used in the Steel Samurai show.
Maya:
Of course! That's the mountain, Neo Fujiyama!
Phoenix:
Doesn't the Steel Samurai take place in Olde Tokyo? Can you even see Mt. Fuji from there?
Maya:
Not Olde Tokyo, Nick! "Neo" Olde Tokyo!October 18Studio Two EntranceMaya:
This... is Studio Two?Phoenix:
I thought so...Maya:
It doesn't really look much like a "studio," does it?Phoenix:
No, that it does not.Maya:
Hey... There's a trailer over there.Phoenix:
It looks pretty sturdy for a movie set trailer.Maya:
Are we sure this is a studio?Examine









Incinerator







Phoenix:
An incinerator. Apparently they just put this one in. It's already covered in soot. They must not clean it much.




Lunch table







Phoenix:
Looks like two people ate here. There's nothing left on the plates.
Maya:
Hey, so they ate t-bone steaks too.
Phoenix:
What is it with steaks around here?
Maya:
Hey! There's always room for steak! But... something does seem out of place...
Phoenix:
What?
Maya:
I... don't know. It just feels "odd."




Number "2" sign







Phoenix:
There's a big "2" painted here.
Maya:
Probably because this is Studio Two?
Phoenix:
Probably... Though it doesn't look anything like a studio.




Studio van







Phoenix:
A light van for moving staff and equipment around. They've kept it in pretty good shape. Looks like it'd run fine.
Maya:
Well, let's go for a drive!
Phoenix:
Sure... if I had a license.
Maya:
Nick! You don't have a driver's license!?
Phoenix:
But, look, I have this!
Maya:
Why are you showing me your attorney's badge, Nick?




Flower garden







Phoenix:
There're some flowers here.
Maya:
Wow, so pretty! They're taking good care of these.
Phoenix:
Don't get to [sic] close. That fence looks dangerous.




Storage materials







Phoenix:
These look like materials for making a movie set.
Maya:
They've been sitting here for quite some time. This might as well be a junkyard.




Trailer







Phoenix:
On closer inspection, this trailer looks like it's been here for a while. I don't think this is part of some temporary film set.




Trailer door







Maya:
Nick! Let's go inside!
Phoenix:
You think it's okay...? Oh well. It's locked.
Maya:
Aww... shucks.October 18Global StudiosEmployee AreaMaya:
Look, it's that assistant girl. Hey!Penny:
Hi... WP's lawyers, right? I heard about the trial! Great job, guys!Phoenix:
Oh? Oh hoh hoh. Don't mention it.Penny:
Is it true they caught the security lady!?Phoenix:
Oh! Oh... oh hoh hoh!Penny:
Actually, she just called me. She told me to cover up that drain...Phoenix:
You mean that one? (Wow, what a mess...)Penny:
I... I know... I'm not so good with handiwork. Some assistant, right?Maya:
Yeah, but you do work on the props, and the backdrops, right?Penny:
R-right. Just... lots of times they end up looking worse than they did before I fixed them.Maya:
Oh? Oh! Well, I'm sure these things happen. Nothing to worry yourself about!Penny:
You're right! I won't!Phoenix:
(Personally, I think she should worry at least a little bit more...)Penny:
Um, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to the guard station. I'm supposed to fill in for Ms. Oldbag.Maya:
Right! See you later, then!Penny:
Good luck with your investigation.Examine









Taped cardboard barrier







Maya:
So, the fanboy they were talking about in the trial today... He came in through that drain?
Phoenix:
So it seems. I guess they covered it up in a hurry.
Maya:
Hey... Hey, Nick! If that drain's covered, the boy won't be able to get in.
Phoenix:
Uh, yeah. I think that was the idea...?
Maya:
I feel kinda sorry for him, though. Don't you?
Phoenix:
What, you want to rip the grate off?
Maya:
Really, Nick? We can!?
Phoenix:
(Whoa... she's serious? Uh oh...)



Rip it open







Phoenix:
Well, I guess some things are just made to be broken.
Maya:
Yay! You know, Nick, you're pretty swell sometimes.
Phoenix:
(Sometimes...?)
Maya:
Hiii-ya! There. That should make the kids happy.
Phoenix:
The things we do...
Leads back to examination




Leave it be







Phoenix:
Nah, I think we should leave it on. They only just repaired it. And if we take it off, that assistant will get yelled at by you-know-who.
Maya:
Yeah... I guess so.
Phoenix:
(Wow! I didn't expect her to take it that hard...)
Leads back to examination





Drain grate (after selecting "Rip it open" upon examining taped cardboard barrier)







Phoenix:
The drain grate is off. And I know who did it.
Maya:
Now the kids'll be able to come in again. Doesn't it make you feel great to do a good deed like that?
Phoenix:
(Must be nice to live so free of guilt.)




Lunch table







Phoenix:
The remains of yesterday's lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak.




Dressing room door







Phoenix:
The door to the dressing room. It's not locked.
Maya:
Hey, Nick! Let's go in! Maybe there'll be something else to steal?
Phoenix:
H-hey! We're not thieves!
Maya:
But we did take that cardkey...
Phoenix:
W-we borrowed that! There's a difference.




Vending machine







Phoenix:
Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks or something. Popcorn, at least!
Maya:
W-wait! Look! "Samurai Soda"! Nick! Try this!
Phoenix:
Be my guest.
Maya:
Okay! Oh, too bad, it's sold out.October 18Global StudiosDressing RoomMaya:
This is where the Steel Samurai costume was, on the day of the murder.Phoenix:
That's what Mr. Powers says, at least. I guess they snuck in and took it while he was sleeping.Maya:
But Nick, what if Mr. Powers hadn't been sleeping? I wonder what the killer was planning on doing then?Phoenix:
Huh... (She's got a point!)Examine









Cosmetics







Phoenix:
There's an array of cosmetics here. According to Maya, that wig was used in some old TV show...
Maya:
"Samurai Boogey-Woogey," Nick! Get with the picture!
Phoenix:
Look, explain to me how you can identify a show just by seeing a wig!?
Maya:
I, um, kinda like samurai movies.
Phoenix:
("Kinda"...?)




Costume rack







Phoenix:
There's some regular suits in among the costumes here. Those must be Mr. Powers's personal clothes.




Couch







Phoenix:
Looks like someone was sleeping here. Maybe Powers did take a nap here, like he said.




Bag







Maya:
Mr. Powers's bag. I wonder what's inside? Hey! Supermarket tabloids? Wow. I'm kind of shocked.
Phoenix:
Maya! Leave those alone! (Wolf Men Found On Mars...? I'll have to buy that issue!)




Table







Phoenix:
There's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Some tea and cookies...
Maya:
Wait... Nick!
Phoenix:
W-what now?
Maya:
These snacks... they've passed the expiration date!
Phoenix:
... Then don't eat them.
Maya:
*grumble* (They're snacks! They're meant to be eaten!)




Window







Phoenix:
It's locked. I guess he doesn't open his window much. It is kind of dusty outside.Studio - Main Gate (after selecting "Rip it open" upon examining taped cardboard barrier in Global Studios - Employee Area)Penny:
Oh... hello.Maya:
Ho hoh! You look a little out of place.Penny:
It's the clothes, isn't it? I thought my camo vest might do the trick... Kind of an "alternative guard fashion" thing.Examine









Guard station







Phoenix:
The security guard station. I can see the computer that runs the security cameras.
Penny:
Oh, please don't touch anything in there. The security lady would knock the stuffing out of me if she knew.Talk









The studios







Phoenix:
So, how are the studios doing?
Penny:
There's police wandering around everywhere, it's terrible. They won't even let me clean up. Don't want me "disturbing evidence." I haven't even cleaned up our lunch plates from the day of the murder!
Phoenix:
You mean those plates with the steak bones left over on them in the employee area?
Penny:
Yeah. Can you believe it?




The fanboy







Maya:
Do kids sneak in here a lot?
Penny:
Well... I don't think there's that many of them, but I do see one in particular a bunch. He's always gawking at the sets, or snapping pictures. You should see Old Windbag's eyes flash when she sees him. She has a bit of trouble catching him though...




The director, et al.







Phoenix:
I heard something at the trial today. They said that the director and producer were here the day of the murder...
Penny:
Oh, sorry... I was in the prop storage room, so I didn't see them. I guess they were here, though. The studio head seemed pretty eager to keep us quiet.
Maya:
So they were trying to protect the director?
Penny:
More the producer, really. The producer's our real star here. She saved these studios from the brink of disaster and kept them running. I don't think we'd still be in business if it weren't for that producer!
Phoenix:
(The producer, huh?)Present









Cardkey







Penny:
Wow, they gave a lawyer one of those cardkeys?
Phoenix:
Well, I'm sort of borrowing it.
Penny:
I see. You better be careful not to lose that. They're very strict about those cardkeys here.
Phoenix:
(I guess they're pretty good about keeping these out of outsider's hands.) Thanks, I'll be careful.




Powers's(?) Photo







Phoenix:
Could you take a look at this?
Penny:
That's Mr. Powers. Why is he dragging his leg like that? What is this, anyway?
Phoenix:
(Looks like she didn't know about this photo or the injury that morning.) Uh... Never mind.




Samurai Spear







Phoenix:
Say, you work with the props, right? About that murder weapon...
Penny:
You mean the Samurai Spear? Yeah, it's a prop, but it's still pretty heavy. I hate having to carry that thing around.
Phoenix:
(So you'd have to be pretty strong to use that as a weapon, it sounds like. Why is Mr. Powers the only person I can think of!?)

The day of the crime







Phoenix:
Did you notice anything unusual on the day of the murder?
Manella:
Oh, I know who j00 d00dz are. That security lady told j00 about us, eh?
Phoenix:
That's right.
Manella:
It was a pretty regular day. We had a run-through for an action scene in the morning. Then a meeting from lunchtime in the Studio Two trailer. Heh. I was so busy I didn't even get a chance to eat lunch! :(
Phoenix:
A t-bone steak, was it?
Manella:
Yeah... sux0rz! I hate missing out on food...
Maya:
Nick... what does "Sucksores" mean?
Phoenix:
No idea...
Manella:
Anyway, I was in a meeting from noon till after 4:00. With the producer, and some bigwigs from the network.
Phoenix:
(Mr. Hammer's time of death was estimated at 2:30 PM. If he's telling the truth, that meeting gives him an alibi...)




The producer (appears after "The day of the crime")







Phoenix:
About the producer who was at the meeting with you...
Manella:
Oh, you mean Dee Vasquez? She's a genius. M4d sk1llz, all the way. Scary, though. *sweats* She brought these studios back from the brink of destruction. She's the one who made it possible for me to make the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
You had a meeting with her on the day of the murder, right?
Manella:
Yeah, we were together from noon to 4:00 PM, the whole time.




The bigwigs (appears after "The day of the crime")







Phoenix:
Who exactly are these "bigwigs" people keep mentioning?
Manella:
Oh, the boss over at the network, and some sponsors. Also a few production guys. They piled into a limousine and got here right around noon. Major tension! *sweats*
Phoenix:
Were all of them with you the entire time?
Manella:
Yeah, unfortunately. They're all gray-haired geezers... *scowl*
Phoenix:
(Hmm... sounds like they'd all be reliable witnesses.)Present









Powers's(?) Photo







Manella:
... T-this is WP, right?
Phoenix:
How do you know?
Manella:
Well, look, he's obviously dragging his foot.

Its head fell over in the wind on the day of the murder. They didn't start moving the head out of the way until after 3:00. It was after 4:00 by the time the path was unblocked. Capice? Everyone in this trailer was stuck here until the path was cleared. Stuck in this trailer. Stuck until after 4:00. Hammer died at 2:30. Thus, none of us could have gone to Studio One.Maya:
W-what!?Vasquez:
It's true. A crane came just after 3:00 to move the head. We called some people in to clear the way. I'm sure they'd corroborate my story.Phoenix:

What do we do, Nick? There isn't anyone besides WP who could have killed Hammer! It's over... We're finished!Phoenix:
(It sure doesn't look good. Guess we should head back to the office and plan our strategy...)Examine









Bench







Phoenix:
I really want to take a break, but we have work to do! Still, it's kind of sad to see so many empty benches... Kind of like if you threw a party, and nobody came.




Left path







Phoenix:
This is the path that goes to Studio Two. The mascot's head fell right on the path on the day of the murder. The path was completely blocked between 2:00 and 4:00.




Mr. Monkey







Phoenix:
I see. There's a clock and a speaker in the monkey's head. It would usually tell the time by "ook"ing. The clock is stopped at 2:15 now.October 18Wright & Co. Law OfficesPhoenix:
Now what... We're fresh out of clues. Everyone's alibi is water-tight. We don't even have any promising leads. Things are looking pretty grim.???:
It's a little early for giving up, don't you think?Phoenix:
Huh????:
You've got one lead...Phoenix:
M-Mia! It's you! What took you so long!?Mia:
Sorry, Phoenix. Maya has trouble calling me unless she's really in trouble.Phoenix:
Right! Oh, wait. I guess that means we're really in trouble.Mia:
I'd say so.Phoenix:
What did you mean, we have one lead...?Mia:
The boy, of course.Cody:
Yeah, I saw 'em. I saw everything!Maya:
What!?Cody:
But...but no way am I telling you losers!Phoenix:
I dunno. He didn't sound like he was going to help us at all.Mia:
I'm sure you can find some way of bringing him over to your side. Either way, we should get back to the studios. That boy is our last hope, Phoenix.Phoenix:
(Thanks, now I'm more worried than I was before...)Examine









Houseplant







Mia:
My poor plant! It looks so... so sluggish! Have you been watering it properly, Phoenix?
Phoenix:
Um, well, Maya has actually... I think maybe she's giving it too much.
Mia:
That child! Sorry, Charley.
Phoenix:
(The plant's name is... Charley?)




Movie poster







Phoenix:
A poster of an old movie that Mia liked. Oh, hey! Mia, what's the name of this movie?
Mia:
That movie...? Oh! I'd sure like to see that one again! It's, um... What was it, again? S-sorry, it's right on the tip of my tongue...
Phoenix:
(Let me guess... it's a suspense thriller?)Talk









What to do







Phoenix:
So, what's the best thing to do from here?
Mia:
We need to get to the studio and talk to that boy.




Any ideas







Phoenix:
So, do you have any ideas about who might have done this?
Mia:
We don't have enough information to make a case yet.
Phoenix:
(Where have I heard that phrase before? So THAT's where Maya got it from...)Present









Anything







Mia:
Showing me that isn't going to do any good. You know what they say, "Dead men don't tell tales."

The director, et al.







Phoenix:
Actually, I met with the director just now...
Oldbag:
Eh? Hah... my heart, it don't feel so good.
Phoenix:
(Is she okay!?)
Oldbag:
B-before I go, I'd like to v-visit the place where poor H-Hammer died...
Phoenix:
(Right... she was saying she wanted to visit the studio where he died.)




The "hostage"







Phoenix:
What's this about a "hostage"?
Oldbag:
Huff... huff... W-when that boy was running away... ...he dropped this, a-and ran! Huff... huff... H-he'll come back... huff... huff... for this one!
Phoenix:
(It's kind of hard to understand her with all that huffing and puffing.)
Mia:
Phoenix! That "hostage" might be what we need! Cody might talk to us if we gave him that!
Phoenix:
(Good idea!) Ms. Oldbag! Might I...
Oldbag:
No! I'm catching that brat if it's the last thing I do!
Mia:
Phoenix. Do you have anything you might trade with her?
Phoenix:
(A trade, hmm... I wonder...?)Present









Cardkey







Oldbag:
H-hey... that... huff... That's a card... huff... Studio One?
Phoenix:
Right. A cardkey to Studio One.
Oldbag:
Huff... puff... I... I could visit poor Hammer... I'd like to visit... huff... he died... whew. I was his... his fan.
Phoenix:
You don't have your own card, Ms. Oldbag?
Oldbag:
Studio One isn't my turf. Huff... huff... You'll let me borrow... borrow it, then?
Phoenix:
(If I give her the cardkey, then I won't be able to get into Studio One...!)



Keep the cardkey







Phoenix:
Sorry, we have our own investigating to do there.
Oldbag:
Huff... huff... puff. Poo.

Welcome sign







Phoenix:
"Welcome"... I wonder if the murder will make this place famous, too.Inside Studio OneExamine









Director's chair







Phoenix:
A classic director's chair. I'm surprised they don't have an extra large one for Mr. Manella.




Film camera







Phoenix:
A collection of expensive film equipment. I can't even begin to imagine how much just one of these costs. If we broke one, we'd go bankrupt for sure.




Reflecting screen







Phoenix:
A panel for reflecting light. They call it a "reflecting board" or something.




Stage backdrop







Phoenix:
A stage backdrop. This is "Neo Fujiyama," according to Maya. It looks incredibly fake, but I guess the kids don't mind.




(Step)ladder







Phoenix:
A perfectly normal stepladder. I've never actually used one. I don't like heights. I'm a firm belever that humankind was made to keep both feet on the ground.Outside Studio TwoExamine









Lunch table







Phoenix:
Looks like two people ate here. There's nothing left on the plates.




Number "2" sign







Phoenix:
There's a big "2" painted here. Probably because this is Studio Two? Probably... Though it doesn't look anything like a studio.




Studio van







Phoenix:
A light van for moving staff and equipment around. They've kept it in pretty good shape. Looks like it'd run fine.




Flower garden







Phoenix:
Nameless flowers bloom in solitude. They probably have a proper name... But it is not for me to know. Not now, nor ever till the end of my days. ... I need a vacation.




Storage materials







Phoenix:
These look like materials for making a movie set. They've been sitting here for quite some time. This might as well be a junkyard.




Trailer door







Phoenix:
The door is unlocked. We could probably just walk right in.TrailerExamine









Left poster







Phoenix:
Another old movie poster. "'The Singing Samurai' starring Jack Hammer." What the hell do samurai sing about? Chopping off heads?
Mia:
It's a samurai musical set in ancient Japan.
Phoenix:
A s-samurai musical? Is that even a genre!? Well, I'm impressed. You know your stuff, Mia.
Mia:
Oh, Maya's the real fan. I just picked a little up.




Middle poster







Phoenix:
"'Samurai Summer' starring Jack Hammer." This poster looks like it's been hanging here for years.
Mia:
This is one of Maya's favorite movies.
Phoenix:
Maybe we should replace the poster in the office with this one?
Mia:
That... would be kind of sad.October 18Global StudiosEmployee AreaPhoenix:

Yeah. His name's "Cody Hackins."Mia:

Bicycle







Phoenix:
Looks like one of those electric-powered bicycles. I dunno about these. I mean, what's the point?
Mia:
It makes it a lot easier to go up hills!
Phoenix:
Where have I heard that line before...?




Dressing room door







Phoenix:
The door to the dressing room. It's not locked.
Mia:
This is where Cody ran... Let's go in and see if we can get him to talk.




Storage room door







Phoenix:
That must be the storage room. That's where they keep all the film equipment.




Vending machine







Phoenix:
Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks, or something. Popcorn, at least!
Mia:
Look at this! "Spaghetti in a Soda Can"...?
Phoenix:
S-spaghetti? Wouldn't just the sauce come out and the noodles all stay stuck inside?
Mia:
"Best when slammed." I guess they want you to drink it in one gulp...?

Cosmetics







Phoenix:
There's an array of cosmetics here. According to Maya, that wig was used in some old TV show...
Cody:
You don't know "Samurai Boogey-Woogey"!? You're even lamer than I thought!
Phoenix:
(Why does everybody but me know about this show!?)




Powers's bag







Phoenix:
Mr. Powers's bag.
Mia:
Now, Phoenix, it's not polite to look through other people's belongings.
Phoenix:
H-hey, don't look at me! (Tell that to your sister!)




Table







Phoenix:
There's a box of snacks on the table, and some cans of soda. They're all empty. I'm glad Maya isn't here to see this. She'd be devastated.
Mia:
Sorry? What was that about Maya?
Phoenix:
O-oh, nothing.Talk









The Steel Samurai







Phoenix:
The Steel Samurai's so cool. I think he's the, um, the "bomb."
Cody:
Hah! What would a lamer like you know about the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
H-hey, watch that attitude!
Mia:
Phoenix, you really should't yell like that. He's only a kid.
Cody:
Yeah! Don't yell like that I'm only a kid!

Steel Samurai Card







Phoenix:

Cody:
Hey! My UR!
Phoenix:
"You are"... huh?
Cody:
"U.R." You know, "ultra rare"! That card's really hard to get! Man, for a grown-up, you sure are dumb!
Phoenix:
I'll give you this... IF you help me.
Cody:
But that's my card! By offering me something I already own, you're in effect eschewing the very basis of our consumer society, namely the principle of fair trade! Man, for a grown-up, you sure are dumb!
Phoenix:
(W-what do they teach these kids in school these days!? Quantum physics!?)
Cody:
Whatever, I don't need that card.
Phoenix:
Huh?
Cody:
I got a double. Just keep it. It's yours.
Phoenix:
(What!? After I went through all that trouble...)
Cody:
If you want to trade, find me a REALLY rare card!
Phoenix:
"Really rare"!? You mean there's something rarer than "Ultra Rare"!?
Cody:
Ultra Rare Premium cards are way rarer than plain Ultra Rare cards! Come ON! Man, for a grown-up, you sure are dumb!
Phoenix:
Premium... rare... why do I feel like we're talking about steaks?

The fanboy







Phoenix:

Nope. You missed it, though. The security lady was chasing around after the boy so fast I thought she'd collapse. Of course, he got away in the end. Boy, was she mad!
Phoenix:
Actually, we saw them. How's the old windbag doing?
Penny:
She was squeezing donuts through her clenched fists back at the guard station.

Are all the posters on the wall here of Hammer?
Penny:
Yes. It's really a terrible loss for the studios.

What is it, Cody?Cody:
Th-the Steel Samurai killed the bad guy! He used his Samurai Spear! Just like always! One shot, one kill! It happened so fast... I got scared. I went home after that.Phoenix:
I... I see. It must have been hard for you.Cody:
Man, you say those nice things but it's so obvious you aren't speaking from the heart.Phoenix:

Yes?Phoenix:
I think we can say for sure this means the Steel Samurai did it.Mia:
True enough.Phoenix:
And the director has an alibi, so it wasn't him.Mia:
Indeed.Phoenix:

Why do you look so... unhappy?Phoenix:
O-oh! Oh, nothing! Eh heh heh. Really, it's nothing. Right, Mia? (Uh oh. She looks even unhappier...)Mia:
Phoenix. Your client is now practically a dead man walking... Perhaps that's why I feel particularly close to him.Phoenix:
This is no time for dead-people jokes, please.Mia:
You know we're going into this trial utterly defenseless. Yet, if Mr. Powers is truly innocent... We should be able to find something overlooked in the evidence to prove it.Phoenix:
Something "overlooked"...?Mia:
We have to find something, Phoenix, today. It's that, or lose the trial.Phoenix:
(This isn't going to be easy.)October 19, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:
Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth:
An unexpected fact has come to the attention of the court. Yesterday, we learned that there were other people present at the studios. Today, I would like to show evidence proving they had nothing to do with the murder.Judge:
Very well. You may call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth.Phoenix:
(I wonder if it'll be that producer...) (Changed from [I wonder if that producer is going to come out...] in the original release)Edgeworth:
The prosecution calls Mr. Sal Manella to the stand.Phoenix:

Were you at Global Studios on the day of the murder?Manella:
Y-yes, Your Honor.Judge:
Hmm... Very well. Please testify to the court about the events of that day.Mia:
Phoenix. Let's start by picking this testimony apart. If Powers is innocent, you know what that means. Someone in the trailer on that day did it!Phoenix:
R-right. (She doesn't waste any time putting on the pressure!)Witness Testimony-- The Day of the Murder --Manella:
I was at the studios from around 9:00 that morning.
During the morning, I was doing... umm... an action scene run-through.
It took a lot more time than I thought it would.
I hear that everyone else ate lunch in the Employee Area...
But I had a meeting in the Studio Two trailer, so I ended up skipping lunch.
We were in the meeting until around 4:00...
During the meeting, well, I'm pretty sure no one left their chairs.
That's about it.Judge:
Hmm... The time of Mr. Hammer's death was 2:30 PM. And according to your testimony, you were in a meeting at that time. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.Cross Examination-- The Day of the Murder --Manella:
I was at the studios from around 9:00 that morning.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Is that when you always come in to work?
Manella:
Oh, oh no. I come in all sort of hours. It's the "industry" way.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, I know all about the freaks in your "industry"...)
Manella:
Still, FWIW, I was pretty busy all that day. :(
Edgeworth:
Tell us more about that.Manella:
During the morning, I was doing... umm... an action scene run-through.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
In the Employee Area?
Manella:
That's right. It was a fight scene between the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate.
Phoenix:
Was anyone else at the run-through?
Manella:
Oh, yeah. That security lady was sitting there watching the whole thing. LOL. She was cheering on Hammer, if you can believe it.
Phoenix:
(She certainly has the lungs for it...) Anyone else?
Manella:
Nope, just us four.Manella:
It took a lot more time than I thought it would.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Why did it go on so long?
Manella:
Um, I'm pretty sure j00've already heard about this... But WP twisted his ankle during the run-through, see...
Phoenix:
(Oh, right, thus the limp.)
Manella:
Which of course led to me missing my lunch. ROFS!
Phoenix:
(ROFS? Rolling on the Floor... Starving?)Manella:
I hear that everyone else ate lunch in the Employee Area...Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What exactly did they have for lunch?
Manella:
T-bone steak! The assistant cooked some up.
Phoenix:
(Come to think of it, there was a plate with some bones on it in the Employee Area.)
Edgeworth:
"Everyone else" meaning that the witness did not eat with them.Manella:
But I had a meeting in the Studio Two trailer, so I ended up skipping lunch.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So, in the end, you didn't get to eat?
Manella:
Yeah. No steak, at least! Can j00 believe it?
Phoenix:
That must have been tough.
Mia:
Phoenix.
Phoenix:
Yeah?
Mia:
Doesn't something about that seem odd to you?



Not at all







Phoenix:
Well, no, not really. Seems pretty straightforward.
Mia:
Oh. Perhaps I was wrong, then.
Leads back to cross-examination




It's a little vague







Phoenix:
Actually, there is something bothering me. Mr. Manella, just now you said "steak, at least." So you ate something other than steak?
Manella:
Yeah, good call! I had some chocolate in my pocket, which I used to stave off starvation!
Phoenix:
I see... (Is that all? I was sure I was on to something there.)
Leads back to cross-examination




It's contradictory







Phoenix:
Yeah, it does seem odd, now that you mention it. Mr. Manella!
Manella:
H-hmm? W-what do j00 mean? *sweats*
Phoenix:
When I went to Studio Two, I saw something on the table there. (Changed from [When I went to that trailer, I saw something on the table.] in the original release) There were two plates--the same kind of plates as the ones in the Employee Area. (Changed from [There were two plates on the table--the same kind of plates as in the Employee Area.] in the original release) Who ate lunch there?
Manella:
M-mmpf! No, er, ah, um, eh heh. Good call! *sweats* I, er, I was embarrassed so I didn't mention it... But I did eat, after all.
Phoenix:
A t-bone steak, you mean?
Manella:
Yeah, well, I mean the assistant went through all that trouble... I brought it to the trailer thinking I could eat it later.
Phoenix:
(Clearly a man who likes to eat. I'd suspected as much...) So, when exactly did you eat it?
Manella:
We took one break during that meeting. I, er, wolfed it down then. *drool*
Phoenix:
(A mental image I will carry with me to my grave... Wait a second...! If they took a break in that meeting, that contradicts his testimony! I'll press on that one a bit more...)
Leads back to cross-examinationManella:
We were in the meeting until around 4:00...Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What were you discussing?
Manella:
The Steel Samurai story, and our budget. Get this! The sponsors turn to me and say, "Mr. Manella. Those scripts of yours are not appropriate for children." Can j00 believe it!?
Phoenix:
(Actually, I kind of can.) So, nobody left the table during the whole meeting?Manella:
During the meeting, well, I'm pretty sure no one left their chairs.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
You didn't take a single break?
Manella:
Er... well... Y-yeah! Not a one! *sweats*

Press harder







Leads to:

Phoenix. If his alibi holds, Powers is finished. Press him as hard as you can and find out where he's lying!Phoenix:
R-right!Phoenix:
Wait a second! Mr. Manella, you've just contradicted yourself! Didn't you just tell the court that you ate that t-bone steak during a break?Manella:
Oops! ROFL!Phoenix:
Well?Manella:
Umm...Judge:
Mr. Manella, what's this all about?Manella:
W-well, yeah, I guess we did take a little break.Mia:
Phoenix! Great job! If they took a break, one of them could have gone to the studio during that time!Phoenix:
Your Honor! I call on the witness to testify to the court about this break!Judge:
Very well. Mr. Manella, your testimony, please.Manella:
Urk!Edgeworth:
Heh heh heh...Phoenix:
(Uh oh. Edgeworth is laughing...)Witness Testimony-- The Break --Manella:
Yeah, FWIW, we took a break... ROFL!
But it was only 15 minutes! 15! That's only 13 in Base 12!
Not enough time for someone to, say, commit murder in Studio One! LOL!
That's only just enough time to eat a t-bone steak, if you ask me! *steams*Judge:
Hmm... I don't think it would even be enough time for that, but that's just me. Very well. You may begin the cross-examination.Cross Examination-- The Break --Manella:
Yeah, FWIW, we took a break... ROFL!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What time exactly did you take this break?
Manella:
Hmm... I'd say it was from around 2:30 or so until 2:45.
Phoenix:
(2:30!!! That's the time of death! So he could have gone to Studio One, killed Hammer, and come back... I guess it's possible, time-wise...)
Edgeworth:

But it was only 15 minutes! 15! That's only 13 in Base 12!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What were you doing for those 15 minutes?
Manella:
Eating my t-bone steak! What else!?
Phoenix:
There were two plates on the trailer table...?
Manella:
Oh, right. The other one was Diva's... sorry, Dee Vasquez's plate.
Phoenix:
(Dee Vasquez... the producer.)
Edgeworth:
To eat a t-bone steak in 15 minutes... that's quite a feat.Manella:

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
I have to say, you look like a guy who gets through his meals pretty fast.
Manella:
Well, I was facing a cold, slightly chewy t-bone steak... Even I have to take my time eating that kind of food. LOLMia:
Well, Phoenix?Phoenix:
That testimony was too short to wring any kind of useful information out of!Mia:
All you have to do is prove that he was able to go to Studio One in that time!Phoenix:
(Oh, great. Is that all...)Phoenix:
Why is that?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
Haven't we had enough of this pointless line of questioning? Your Honor! The testimony to this point has made one certain fact painfully clear: The people in the trailer had nothing to do with this murder! It was impossible for any of them to go to Studio One!Phoenix:
What!?Edgeworth:
Something wrong, Mr. Wright? Surely you aren't suggesting one of the people in the trailer went to Studio One!Judge:
Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright?Mia:
Phoenix, this is critical! Think about it before you give your answer!Judge:
Do you claim someone from the trailer went to Studio One?I claim it, and claim it loud







Phoenix:
(If I agree to let everyone in that trailer off the hook then the trial is over... Mr. Powers will be found guilty for sure!) The victim was murdered at 2:30, the exact time of the break in the meeting. With 15 minutes, murder is certainly a possibility!
Judge:
Hmm... I suppose you might say that...
Phoenix:
(Alright, I've got the judge thinking now!)
Edgeworth:
Tsk, tsk, tsk... Never a dull moment with you, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
What's your point, Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
You've been doing your homework, haven't you? Look at the Court Record.
Phoenix:
The Court Record...?
Edgeworth:
Surely, you knew that from 2:15 to 4:00 the path between the studios was blocked? Mrs. Monkey's head had fallen across the path!
Phoenix:
Whoa! You're right!
Edgeworth:
True, the break in the trailer meeting came right at the time of death... However! The path from there to the scene of the crime was blocked! The fallen Mrs. Monkey head barred the way!
Phoenix:
... (It's actually "Mr. Monkey," but Edgeworth has a point... And somehow, I feel no desire to correct him.)
Judge:
No counter-argument, Mr. Wright? Then I'm afraid you lose this round.
Leads to:
"I believe we have seen enough evidence."No, it's impossible.







Phoenix:
(I don't want to write off so many possible suspects... But I can't keep claiming the impossible, either...) I agree that it was impossible for anyone in the trailer to go to the studio in that time.
Edgeworth:
Ha hah! I thought you might be thoughtlessly treading on thin ice again! But I see you had at least an inkling of the truth.
Judge:
What do you mean, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
It's quite simple... True, the break in the trailer meeting came right at the time of death... However! The path from there to the scene of the crime was blocked! The fallen Mrs. Monkey head barred the way! At around 2:15, a strong gust of wind knocked off the studio mascot's head. Ergo! When the people in the trailer took a break at 2:30, the way to the studio was blocked. Blocked... by Mrs. Monkey's severed head!
Phoenix:
... (It's actually "Mr. Monkey," but Edgeworth has a point... And somehow, I feel no desire to correct him.)
Leads to:
"I believe we have seen enough evidence."Edgeworth:
I believe we have seen enough evidence. I would like to relieve Mr. Manella from the stand.Phoenix:
(Wh-what? It's over?)Judge:
Very well. The court's opinion on this case is as follows: We have found that there were several other people in Studio 2 on the day of the murder. However, it is also clear that none of these people could have gone to Studio One. They therefore have no relation to this case. Furthermore, with regards to the photo of the Steel Samurai... Given the size of the costume, no one other than Mr. Powers could have worn it that day. All that is lacking is decisive evidence that he is the one who did it. If we had that, I'm afraid I would have to find Mr. Powers guilty.Edgeworth:
Your Honor. The prosecution is pleased to announce that we indeed have decisive evidence: a witness.Judge:
Who is this witness, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:
My witness saw the very moment when the Steel Samurai skewered the victim!Judge:
Order! I will have order! I see. The court will take a 10 minute recess, after which we will hear your witness. Court is adjourned for recess!October 19, 11:04 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Mia:

What do we do now, Mia? If everyone in that trailer has an alibi...Mia:
... I'm sorry, Phoenix. I guess I was wrong.Phoenix:
M-Mia! Don't tell me you're giving up! If you give up, what hope do I have...?Mia:
... Don't get me wrong. I've never given up on a trial before, not while there was a chance. Only one thing became clear in your cross-examination. The people in the trailer could not have gone to Studio One. I thought there was more to it than that... But I was wrong. That's all there is.Will:
Umm... Er... What's going to happen to me? It kinda seems like everyone in that courtroom thinks I did it... They think I'm a murderer!Mia:
Don't worry, Mr. Powers. If you are innocent, we will prove it. I guarantee it. Leave it to us, and... be yourself. Be strong. You are the Steel Samurai, hero to children everywhere, after all.Will:
I... You... Thanks. *sniff*Mia:
Okay, Phoenix. This one's for the kids! Let's do it!October 19, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:
Court is back in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:
The prosecution has a concern. As our witness is a grade schooler of tender years, and this is a murder case... we worry that the defense might cause unnecessary trauma with his cruel questioning. (Changed from [We worry that the defense might cause unnecessary trauma with his cruel questioning!] in the original release)Phoenix:
(Nice to see Edgeworth taking the moral high ground...)Edgeworth:
However, we have no choice. The prosecution calls Cody Hackins to the stand.Edgeworth:
Your Honor. Perhaps you could arrange a box for him to stand on?Judge:
Oh, r-right. Guard, please bring him a box. One of those donut crates should do.Edgeworth:
Will the witness state his name and grade in school.Cody:

Hey! I just got this new camera! Don't really know how to use it all that good yet! But I bring it with me wherever I go!Mia:

Very well, Cody. Please testify to the court about what you saw the day of the incident.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Cody:
I wanted to see a Steel Samurai rehearsal, just once.
I found a map on the Internet, and went to the studios that day.
I went through the woods off the path, so that old lady wouldn't catch me.
I was going for the studio.
I got kinda lost on the way, though. For about 30 minutes.

Um, well... er, that's the thing...Mia:
Phoenix! I believe you're on the right track with this! Think: why didn't Cody see the climax of the fight? I know you! You can figure this out!Judge:
Mr. Wright, your answer! We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai... Why wouldn't he watch the climax of the fight?He couldn't watch it







Phoenix:
Because he couldn't watch it! How could he calmly watch a murder taking place at his age!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Just a moment, please... One thing has become quite clear in this boy's testimony. He did not believe he was witnessing a murder! He was watching the Steel Samurai fight, like on TV. The more real the fight, the more he would have watched!

Umm... huh.

I have to agree with Mr. Edgeworth. Well, Mr. Wright. Do you have another explanation?

Good job, Phoenix! Cody was lying, clearly. Smart of you to realize there was no way he could just stand there, watching his hero... and not take a picture!Phoenix:
Right! Cody? There was only one reason why you would have looked away from the fight. And that was because you wanted to take a picture. But having just received your camera, you weren't used to using it yet! So, you missed the climax of the fight. Correct?Cody:
... ... ... Yeah.Mia:
Well, Phoenix. I'll bet you anything he's hiding more than that. Have him testify again!Phoenix:

V-very well. Cody? Could you please tell us about your camera... And about why you didn't take a picture of the fight?Cody:
Umm...Phoenix:
(Welcome to the real world, kid!)Witness Testimony-- No Photo? --Cody:
Yeah, you're right, pops.
The Steel Samurai had just escaped from the clutches of the villain.
So I held up my camera to take a picture!
But the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it.
Th-that's all that happened. Yup.Judge:
Hmm... Anything strange in that testimony, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:
I'm not sure... But I'd like to proceed with the cross-examination anyway.Cross Examination-- No Photo? --Cody:
Yeah, you're right, pops.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
"Pops"...?
Cody:
Yeah, I called you "pops," you spiky-haired geezer!
Phoenix:
G-geezer...?
Edgeworth:
I'm "Mr. Edgeworth."
Judge:
And I guess I'm the "bearded gentleman"...
Cody:
That's what I hate about grown-ups. You're all so self-conscious!
Phoenix:
Okay, off with the kid gloves! Testify, witness, testify!
Cody:
Yipes!Cody:
The Steel Samurai had just escaped from the clutches of the villain.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So you did see the beginning of the fight?
Cody:
Yeah.
Phoenix:
Did you notice anything unusual?
Cody:
Umm... well... uh... I guess the Steel Samurai was moving a little strange...
Phoenix:
(Moving... strangely?)Cody:
So I held up my camera to take a picture!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Why couldn't you take a picture?
Cody:
My new camera has too many buttons. I couldn't figure it out. I tried to take a picture, I really tried.Cody:
But the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
When the lens opened, what did you see?
Cody:
Uh... well, a person on the ground. And the Steel Samurai!Cody:
Th-that's all that happened. Yup.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
That's all?
Cody:
Y-yeah! I told you, I didn't take a picture!
Phoenix:
(Hmm... I would have, once I got that lens open... Did he really not take a picture? Not even one?)



Press him hard







Phoenix:
(Nah, he definitely would have taken a picture. There's got to be something here I can use!) Cody! Listen up, Cody Hackins. I know exactly what happened that day. You took a picture!
Cody:
... Hey!
Phoenix:
(Bullseye...?)
Cody:
H-how did you know!?
Phoenix:
I see through all your lies Cody Hackins. It's one of my powers!
Cody:
W-wow!
Phoenix:
(This feels great!)
Cody:
Y-yeah... Yeah, I took a picture.
Judge:
Perhaps you can change your testimony to reflect this, Cody?
Changes statement from "Th-that's all that happened. Yup." to "I took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em."




Let it slide







Phoenix:
(He looks ready to burst into tears... I'd better lay off him for now.)
Leads back to cross-examinationCody:
I took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
You "erased" them?
Cody:
Y-yeah!
Phoenix:
Why would you erase a picture of your beloved Steel Samurai, victorious?
Cody:
Well... y'know. W-why would I want to keep a picture like that?
Phoenix:
(Hmm... he's becoming less and less cooperative. I better find a clear contradiction soon... or some solid evidence.)Present "Path to Glory"







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Cody!"Phoenix:
(How can I pick holes in such a short testimony?)Mia:
There has to be something. Dig up the dirt, Phoenix! Find out what this kid's all about!Phoenix:
Cody!Cody:
Wh-wh-what!? Man, every time you say "Cody" you follow it with something bad.Phoenix:
I just wanted to thank you for giving me this the other day.Cody:
Huh? O-oh... right.Phoenix:
What was it you told me then?Cody:
I go to every live performance! I always take a picture when the Steel Samurai lands the final blow! Whizzam! I got 'em all! I never missed one! A perfect collection!Phoenix:
Cody. Did you really get a picture of the Steel Samurai standing victorious over his foe? If you did, I find it hard to believe that you would just erase it! Wouldn't you keep it for your album?Cody:
Ah!Judge:
Mr. Wright... What exactly is this album?Phoenix:
It's called "Path to Glory." It's a collection of pictures of the Steel Samurai, all taken by Cody Hackins. He claims it's a perfect collection of every battle the Steel Samurai has won!Judge:
I... I see.Phoenix:
Don't you find this very odd, Your Honor? Among all his pictures of the Steel Samurai, none were taken that day!Judge:
Order! Mr. Wright. Have you an explanation? If the Steel Samurai had just defeated his adversary... I certainly would expect to see a picture of it in this album...Phoenix:
Exactly my point, Your Honor! ... ... .........! (No... wait... no way!)Mia:
Phoenix? I think we've finally discovered the truth. And what a truth it is!Phoenix:
M-Mia... are we sure about this? Did he actually...?Mia:
Yes. I'm pretty sure what you're thinking is right. Tell them, Phoenix. Tell them what the truth is.Judge:
Mr. Wright! Please explain to the court what is going on here! Why was there no picture in the album from the day of the murder? Why would the boy have erased the photos he took?The photos were blurry







Phoenix:
I believe that Cody Hackins is what we call an "artiste."
Judge:
An... "artiste"...?
Phoenix:
He didn't like the photos he had taken! They were blurry, or maybe his framing was off... Anyway, for some reason, he erased the data!
Judge:
Is that right, Cody?
Cody:
Wh-what do you mean "framing was off"!?
Judge:
It seems the only thing "off" is your guesswork, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Um, uh... Yes, well, I'm sure the real reason is...
Judge:
Yes? The real reason is?
Leads back to:
"Why was there no picture in the album from the day of the murder?"He erased them by mistake







Phoenix:
Simple, Your Honor. Cody wasn't used to using his new camera. He erased those photos he took by mistake!
Mia:
W-wait a second, Phoenix. If that's your answer, we're back where we started!
Phoenix:
Huh? You mean, that wasn't it?
Judge:
Mr. Wright! If you have something to say to the court, speak up!
Phoenix:
Um, well... S-sorry, Your Honor. Can I change my answer?
Judge:
Hmm... *sigh*
Leads back to:
"Why was there no picture in the album from the day of the murder?"The Steel Samurai didn't win







Leads to:
"I can think of only one reason, Your Honor."Phoenix:
I can think of only one reason, Your Honor. The Steel Samurai didn't win! That's why Cody deleted those photos.Judge:
You mean the Steel Samurai... lost?Phoenix:
Well, Cody? I'm right, aren't I? Tell the truth. The bad guy defeated the Steel Samurai!Cody:
N-n-n-no way! No! I-it's impossible! Th-the Steel Samurai never loses! He never loses to anyone! Ever!Phoenix:
Your Honor... The witness has revealed everything with his words. There was a reason why he lied and told us he didn't take a picture. The same reason he erased his precious photos! For Cody, it was inconceivable that the Steel Samurai could be defeated. However, Cody witnessed the impossible! He saw the Steel Samurai lose! Yet to admit what he saw would destroy everything he believed in! That's why he lied and said the Steel Samurai won. He couldn't handle the truth!Judge:
O-Order! I will have order! W-witness! I mean, Cody! Is this true!? W-what did you see? Tell the court what you saw!Cody:
I...... Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!Phoenix:
Cody... That day, you saw the Steel Samurai lose a fight. Right?Cody:
Waaaaaaaaaaaaah! Okay okay! Y-you're right! Th-the Steel Samurai f-fell down... Th-then he didn't m-move... Waaaaaaaaah!Judge:
Order! Order! Order!Edgeworth:
What kind of stunt are you trying to pull, Wright!? The Steel Samurai was the murderer, not the victim!Phoenix:
Yet according to your witness's testimony, the Steel Samurai was the one who fell!Judge:
Mr. Wright! What's going on?Phoenix:
Apparently, we have all made a serious error.Edgeworth:
An... error? What's this all about!?Hammer was the victim







Phoenix:
Quite simply, the victim was Jack Hammer!
Judge:
...
Edgeworth:
...
...
Judge:
Umm... Mr. Wright? We all know that.
Phoenix:
Right.
Judge:
Perhaps you'd like to reconsider your last statement?
Phoenix:
... I'm sorry. It was I who was wrong.
Edgeworth:
Okay, Wright! First you're right, now you're wrong!? Which is it!?
Phoenix:
L-look, I'm sure there's something we're overlooking!
Edgeworth:
If you're so sure, then tell us what it is!
Leads back to:
"What's this all about!?"Steel Samurai was the victim







Leads to:
"If you understand what really happened, it's actually quite simple."There was no victim







Phoenix:
There was no victim in this case!
Judge:
Wh-wh-what!? Has the defense taken leave of its senses!?
Phoenix:
Of course, Jack Hammer died. But the Steel Samurai fell too! It was a draw!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
... Sorry. I was too shocked to say anything for a bit there. Listen, Wright! Only one person died in this incident, and that is Jack Hammer! Yet now you claim there "was no victim"? Are you insane?
Phoenix:
(Uh oh, he's pulling out all the stops now.) ... I'm sorry. It was I who was wrong.
Edgeworth:
Okay, Wright! First you're right, now you're wrong!? Which is it!?
Phoenix:
L-look, I'm sure there's something we're overlooking!
Edgeworth:
If you're so sure, then tell us what it is!
Leads back to:
"What's this all about!?"Phoenix:
If you understand what really happened, it's actually quite simple. At the end of the fight, the Steel Samurai fell to the ground, and lay still. In other words, the Steel Samurai was not the killer, he was the victim! Don't you see? Jack Hammer was the Steel Samurai!Judge:
Order! Order! Order! So, the Steel Samurai in this photograph... You're saying the man in this costume was the victim, Mr. Jack Hammer?Phoenix:
That's what I'm saying, Your Honor. Jack Hammer was present at the action scene run-through that morning. Thus, he obviously knew about Will Powers's foot injury.Judge:
B-but wait! Hadn't Mr. Hammer gone to Studio One already?Phoenix:
That's what everyone thought! But remember what Ms. Oldbag said in her testimony?Oldbag:
On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM. Did I see poor old Hammer? Nope. He'd already gone to the studio before I got back to the guard station.Phoenix:
Mr. Jack Hammer left the Employee Area after lunch. However, no one saw him going to Studio One. Nor was there a picture of him. He waited for Mr. Powers to take a nap in his dressing room. Then he snuck into the dressing room and stole the Steel Samurai costume.Judge:
...Edgeworth:
...Judge:
But why would the victim do such a thing?Phoenix:
I... don't know.Cody:
... I get it!Phoenix:
?Cody:
I thought that the Steel Samurai was moving strange. So it was a different person inside the suit! Pops!Phoenix:
Huh, me? What?Cody:
Actually, there was one piece of data I saved.Phoenix:
Data?Cody:
Yeah, a photo on my digital camera!Phoenix:
! W-what!?Edgeworth:
Show us, quick!Cody:
No way man, not if you're gonna look at me like that!Judge:
Now!Cody:
*sniff* Here... This is it.Judge:
... Well, looking at this it's still a little hard to say. I'm afraid that it could be anyone in that costume. Your opinion, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:
I agree, Your Honor. This isn't decisive evidence.Judge:
I'm sorry, this doesn't look like it's the proof we need. I'll give it back.Mia:
Wait, Phoenix!Phoenix:
Mia? What?Mia:
Look at that photo once more! That's it Phoenix! That photo is all the evidence you need to win this trial!Phoenix:
Wh-what!? Y-Your Honor! May I see that photo once more please?Judge:
C-certainly. I don't see why not.Mia:
Phoenix! Show him! There's a glaring, decisive inconsistency with the facts as we know them in that photo!Phoenix:
(Find the inconsistency in the photo!)Present number "2" sign







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Your Honor! Look at this!"Present Steel Samurai







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
It's right here!
Judge:
The Steel Samurai...?
Phoenix:
Yes, that's about the only thing in this picture that could be inconsistent. The Steel Samurai is inconsistent with... something.
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Wright! This is no time for daydreaming and pointless pontification! Think about your client, and us, who are forced to listen to your rambling!
Judge:
Mr. Wright, please rethink your position.
Leads back to:
"Find the inconsistency in the photo!"Present anywhere else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
I think it's here.
Judge:
You seem to be lacking even more confidence than usual.
Phoenix:
I suppose that's because I'm not confident about it at all.
Judge:
Maybe you want to rethink your case, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Yes, please, Your Honor.
Leads back to:
"Find the inconsistency in the photo!"Phoenix:
Your Honor! Look at this!Judge:
I see... a gate?Phoenix:
Might I draw your attention to the number on that gate?Judge:
The number? Ah yes. Well, it's hard to see, but it looks like a "2."Phoenix:
Clearly not a "1," Your Honor, correct?Edgeworth:
Aaaaaah!Phoenix:
I believe Mr. Edgeworth sees what I'm getting at.Edgeworth:
B-but... Th-that's impossible!Judge:
Hmm? Eh? What's this all about? Please explain so that I might be shocked along with the rest of the court.Phoenix:
I'll use the studio guidemap. The body was found here, in Studio One. However, what do we see in this photo taken at the time of the murder? It does NOT say "1" on that gate in the photo. Your Honor! Here is the true scene of the crime! (Show the judge where the murder took place!)Present Studio Two







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Here, at Studio Two."Present anywhere else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
It was here!
Judge:
What does that have to do with the number on the gate in the photograph...?
Phoenix:
Umm... well... Sorry, Your Honor, I guess I hadn't thought it that far through yet.
Judge:
Think it through before you point at the map this time, Mr. Wright! Once again! Where is he scene of this crime?
Leads back to:
"Show the judge where the murder took place!"Phoenix:
Here, at Studio Two.Judge:
I see! That would explain the "2" on the gate in the photo.Phoenix:
Your Honor, I find it very significant that the murder took place in Studio Two!The trailer is there







Phoenix:
As you may recall, there is a trailer in Studio Two. Now, on that day, a meeting was held in that very trailer. There was a break in the meeting corresponding to the time of death. During that break, Mr. Sal Manella and Ms. Dee Vasquez were outside, eating steak. They were at the scene of the crime! The path to the trailer was blocked!
Judge:
So we have heard.
Phoenix:
The path was blocked at 2:15... In other words, the victim went to Studio Two before that time!
Judge:
Yes... yes, I suppose that would be the case.
Phoenix:
Remember Mr. Sal Manella's testimony? Allow me to remind the court: He said no one in the trailer was guilty because they could not have gone to Studio One. Yet, in actuality, the reverse was true! Only someone in the trailer could have committed this murder! They were the only ones with access to the scene of the crime: Studio Two!
Leads to:
"O-order! Order!"The path was blocked







Phoenix:
The path to the trailer was blocked!
Judge:
So we have heard.
Phoenix:
The path was blocked at 2:15... In other words, the victim went to Studio Two before that time!
Judge:
Yes... yes, I suppose that would be the case.
Phoenix:
Remember Mr. Sal Manella's testimony? Allow me to remind the court: He said no one in the trailer was guilty because they could not have gone to Studio One. Yet, in actuality, the reverse was true! Only someone in the trailer could have committed this murder! They were the only ones with access to the scene of the crime: Studio Two! As you may recall, there is a trailer in Studio Two. Now, on that day, a meeting was held in that very trailer. There was a break in the meeting corresponding to the time of death. During that break, Mr. Sal Manella and Ms. Dee Vasquez were outside, eating steak. They were at the scene of the crime!
Leads to:
"O-order! Order!"No filming is done there







Phoenix:
Studio Two is no longer being used for filming!
Judge:
I see... And this is significant... why?
Phoenix:
(Good question! I really should think these things through more.)
Judge:
Would you like to take another stab at it? So to speak?
Phoenix:
S-stabbing away, Your Honor.
Leads back to:
"Your Honor, I find it very significant that the murder took place in Studio Two!"Judge:
O-order! Order!Phoenix:
The defense makes the following claims: The scene of the crime was Studio Two! The person that the security guard, Ms. Oldbag saw was the victim, Mr. Jack Hammer! Mr. Hammer, for some reason, stole a Steel Samurai costume. Then he went to Studio Two!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
This is madness! Jack Hammer is the victim! The victim! Why would he steal a Steel Samurai costume!? Are you suggesting he did so to cover up the details of his own murder!?Phoenix:
W-well, no, of course not...Judge:
Hmm...Edgeworth:
Or do you have proof!? Give me proof that the victim, Jack Hammer, stole the costume!I have proof







Phoenix:
I have proof!
Edgeworth:
Y-you do!?
Judge:
You do, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
(Now that they're so surprised suddenly I'm much less confident... I think I'm right, though!)
Leads to:
"Here's my proof that Jack Hammer stole the costume!"I don't have proof







Phoenix:
(Proof? Uh oh... I'm pretty sure I don't have anything like that...)
Mia:
Phoenix. Even if you're not 100% sure about this, you have to try. And I think you've got proof that's good enough to win them over! Just go for it! All or nothing!
Phoenix:
Your Honor...
Judge:
Yes, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Actually... I do have proof.
Leads to:
"Here's my proof that Jack Hammer stole the costume!"Phoenix:
Here's my proof that Jack Hammer stole the costume!Present Empty Bottle







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"This is it."Present anything else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
(Wait, no, that can't be right... I've got to have some proof that will knock their socks off...)
Judge:
Mr. Wright! We don't have all the time in the world, here.
Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor!
Leads back to:
"Here's my proof that Jack Hammer stole the costume!"Phoenix:
This is it.Judge:
An empty... medicine bottle?Phoenix:
I found this on the table in the Employee Area. The same table where Mr. Hammer and Mr. Powers ate. The label reads "sleeping pills."Judge:
"Sleeping pills"...?Phoenix:
The defendant, Mr. Powers, spent that entire afternoon sleeping. He was drugged... by Mr. Hammer!Judge:
Wait a moment... That bottle does raise some suspicions, yes. But there is no proof that Mr. Hammer used it.Phoenix:
Your Honor, I have an idea.Test Powers's blood







Judge:
An... idea? Continue.
Phoenix:
Run a test of Powers's blood. You should find traces of the sleeping pills.
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
This much time after the day of the murder!? Even if there were traces it still proves nothing! No blood test could tell that Hammer was the one who drugged him, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(He's right. Darn. That didn't work. Time to try another idea.)
Leads back to:
"Your Honor, I have an idea."Fingerprint the bottle







Leads to:
"An... idea? Very well, let's hear it."Examine Hammer's body







Judge:
An idea, Mr. Wright? And that would be?
Phoenix:
Er... we should examine Mr. Hammer's body.
Judge:
Mr. Hammer...? I thought that it was Mr. Powers who was made to take the sleeping pills?
Phoenix:
I-indeed it was, Your Honor. (Wrong again...)
Leads back to:
"Your Honor, I have an idea."Judge:
An... idea? Very well, let's hear it.Phoenix:
I want to check this bottle for fingerprints! If my claim is true, Mr. Hammer's fingerprints should show up on this bottle!Edgeworth:
Hmm...Judge:
I suppose you're right. Very well. The court will take possession of the bottle.Empty Bottle given to the judge.Judge:
This court will suspend proceedings on the current trial for today. Cody Hackin's [sic] testimony has revealed new possibilities in this case. In fact, things may have happened very differently than we previously thought. The Steel Samurai seen by Ms. Oldbag may have been the victim, Jack Hammer. The scene of the crime was not Studio One, but Studio Two. And those in the trailer did have time to commit murder. Mr. Wright?Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor?Judge:
Your homework is to find the answer to the following question: Why would Mr. Hammer steal the Steel Samurai costume? Also, who killed him, and why? Find the answers for me by tomorrow.Phoenix:
(That's a lot of homework!)Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth.Edgeworth:
Mm?Judge:
You will need to reconsider your stance in this case. Above all, you will need to reconsider your suspicion of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:
As you say, Your Honor.Judge:
This trial will be extended until tomorrow. This is the last extension! Very well... Court is adjourned!October 19, 2:47 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Phoenix:
Whew! That was a close one!Mia:
We were saved by a hair, but that's all that counts. I thought seriously about going home about three times during the trial.Phoenix:
M-me too!Will:
Really? You both seemed so... so confident!Phoenix:
Hah! Maybe I should take up a career in acting? I was ready to pronounce you dead about three times back there.Mia:
Me too!Will:
D-dead!?Mia:
Hoh hoh. Of course, we're kidding.Will:
Are you sure?Phoenix:
(I wasn't kidding...) Now, Mr. Powers. We have to go make our final investigation. But I promise you, we'll find the true killer by tomorrow's trial!Will:
R-right! Thanks! *sniff*To be continued.Presenting wrong evidence during testimony







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
Judge:
Uh... I'm not sure I follow?
Phoenix:
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
Judge:
You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)Presenting wrong evidence during testimony







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Judge:
...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...
Phoenix:
Huh? Really?
Judge:
Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)Presenting wrong evidence during testimony







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
How exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...?
Phoenix:
They aren't, are they...
Judge:
Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)Presenting wrong evidence during testimony







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
Judge:
... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Ugh, I must be on the wrong track?)Too many penalties







Judge:
That's enough! This court see no reason to further prolong the trial.
Phoenix:
(Uh oh...)
Judge:
This court finds the defendant, Mr. Will Powers...

Guilty

Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!Turnabout Samurai

That was a close one, huh, Mia?Maya:
Really? Too bad, I'm sorry I missed it.Phoenix:
? M-Maya!Maya:
So, what happened?Phoenix:
Well, I think I've got a pretty good idea who did it. Now all I need is a motive... and proof.Maya:
Wow! Good going, Nick!Phoenix:
Under the "initial trial" system, tomorrow is the last day we have.Maya:
"Initial trial"...? What's that?Phoenix:
That's the new court system they introduced two or three years ago. They had so many cases in the system, they decided to speed the whole process up.Maya:
So, under that system, trials have to end in three days?Phoenix:
Yeah, pretty much. Well, we've no time to waste!Talk









The Steel Samurai







Phoenix:
I don't get it, Maya. Why would Mr. Hammer steal the Steel Samurai costume?
Maya:
What!? You mean Mr. Hammer was wearing the costume!?
Phoenix:
Yeah!
Maya:
B-but Mr. Hammer was the victim, Nick! Why would he go through the trouble of stealing it?
Phoenix:
That's what we have to find out.




The director's alibi







Maya:
What happened with the director's testimony?
Phoenix:
Well, it's pretty clear that the producer and the director were both in the trailer.
Maya:
Huh...
Phoenix:
Which means that the killer has to be one of them!
Maya:
Really!? Why?
Phoenix:
Because the real scene of the crime was Studio Two... where that trailer is!
Maya:
Whaaaat!?
Phoenix:
(Hmm... was Maya always this excitable?)




Any ideas







Phoenix:
Well, have you noticed anything that might help us?
Maya:
I can't see what's going on when Mia is here... So, no. I haven't noticed anything.
Phoenix:
Right...
Maya:
Maybe we should go talk to WP?
Phoenix:
(WP... Powers... right.)Present









Powers's(?) Photo







Phoenix:
(Who would have thought that it was Jack Hammer inside! But why did he steal it? That's what I have to figure out.)
Maya:
...?




Samurai Spear







Maya:
I wish I had my own Samurai Spear! Just think, I could poke you as much as I wanted!
Phoenix:
Me!? Why me!?




"Path to Glory"







Phoenix:
What do you think about this? It's that fanboy's prized possession.
Maya:
Wow! Impressive! ... It's a little different from the Steel Samurai on TV...
Phoenix:
These are mostly taken at those PR shows they do at stores and fairs... I'm pretty sure it's not even Will Powers inside that suit.
Maya:
No true fan would be satisfied with anything less than the real thing! He's still a child, I suppose... I guess it takes an adult to appreciate the real deal. Right, Nick?
Phoenix:
Um, yeah, whatever you say.




Cody's Camera







Phoenix:
This is Cody's--
Maya:
Hey! A digital camera! I'm impressed a kid like him would have something this expensive. Kids these days!
Phoenix:
(I don't imagine spirit mediums-in-training get a lot of toys...)October 19Detention CenterVisitor's RoomWill:
Mr. Wright! You did very well again today... Thank you!Phoenix:
Oh... thanks. Um, could you not look like you're about to burst into tears...?Maya:
Wow, Nick! You must have really wowed 'em in there.Phoenix:
And could you wipe that grin off your face? (Changed from [You could stop looking so... vulnerable, too.] in the original release)Maya:
Hey, WP! Only one day left! Let's make it count!Will:
Yes... Though there's not really anything I can do to help.Maya:
Hah hah hah! I'm not really sure what I can do, either.Phoenix:
Please... this is no laughing matter.Talk









Producer Vasquez







Phoenix:
Could you tell me more about Ms. Vasquez?
Will:
Oh... the producer? She's well respected in the industry. They say she's a genius.
Maya:
A genius...?
Will:
She's been at Global Studios for five years now. Right or wrong, nobody dares tell her different these days.
Phoenix:
Why is that?
Will:
Ever since she came on board, we've had nothing but hits. Global Studios was on its knees, but she picked it up and made it shine. Oh, and...
Maya:
And... what?
Will:
N-nothing. Forget it. I... I've only heard rumors, anyhow.




Director Manella







Phoenix:
Can you tell me anything about Mr. Manella?
Will:
Oh, he used to be a minor straight-to-video director. But something in his work caught Vasquez's eye. She brought the Steel Samurai idea to him. Now everyone knows the name Sal Manella. I hear he's pretty much at her beck and call, though. Whenever she says "jump!" he asks "how high?" and all that.
Phoenix:
(I can imagine him being at her beck and call... though I can't imagine him jumping.)




Mr. Hammer







Maya:
I was wondering about Mr. Hammer... He was a big star back in the day, right? But then he just dropped off the face of the Earth.
Will:
Oh... Yes, you're right. In fact, he was my role model when I started in this business. But he just stopped taking on big roles. That's when he began appearing in little productions at Global...
Maya:
How could he do that!? I was really looking forward to a sequel to "Samurai Summer."
Will:
He just gave up being a star five years ago. Actually, now that I think about it... That was right when Ms. Vasquez came to Global.
Phoenix:

Powers's(?) Photo







Phoenix:
Here's that picture again.
Will:
I-is that really Jack Hammer inside that suit?
Phoenix:
He's the only one who it could have been.
Will:
But why would he...?
Maya:
Yeah! Why?
Phoenix:
You're the medium! Why don't you summon up Mr. Hammer's spirit and ask him yourself?
Maya:
*sigh* Gimme about three more years.
Phoenix:
(Look at us, the two novices.)




"Path to Glory"







Phoenix:
Have you seen this, Mr. Powers?
Will:
W-what's that!? I've never seen these Steel Samurais in my life...
Phoenix:
These are the Steel Samurais that appear at live shows. A fanboy collected all these pictures himself.
Will:
... Seeing things like this really makes me think... I mean so much to these kids, you know? *sniff*




Anything else







Will:
E-excuse me. Thank you for showing me that, whatever it is. I wish I could think of some way for me to help you... S-sorry. *sniff*October 19Global StudiosMain GateOldbag:

Producer Vasquez







Phoenix:
Um, I was wondering about Dee Vasquez, the producer.
Oldbag:
Oh, the studio bigwigs LOVE her. So she always gets her way.
Phoenix:
(She seems bitter...)
Maya:
Do you... not like the producer?
Oldbag:
Look, the studio people don't want me talking about her, so, sorry.




Director Manella







Phoenix:
Can I ask you about Sal Manella, the director?
Oldbag:
Sal? He's soft--a pushover. Does whatever Vasquez tells him to. She treats him like dirt, but I think he likes it.
Maya:
Huh? Why would anyone like being treated like dirt? That doesn't make any sense, does it, Nick?
Phoenix:
Er... No, no it doesn't, Maya.




Mr. Hammer







Phoenix:
About Mr. Hammer...
Oldbag:
Arrgh! I heard about what you said today! Cheeky whippersnapper! Poor old Hammer! You'd drag his star down from the sky and stomp on it! Calling him a criminal! A thief! I-I-I-I... I won't forget this!!!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh, she's really pissed this time!)
Oldbag:
You listen to me, whippersnapper! My poor old Hammer would never do such a thing! Why would he steal Powers's costume so he could sneak by me? He would never stoop so low! It's impossible!Present

Maya:

Phoenix:
Can't say that I do...

Phoenix:
There's a big "2" painted here. So this is the number in Cody's photograph. And to think, if he hadn't brought that photograph in...

Maya:
Umm... Mr. Powers wasn't the killer! You don't have to cancel the Steel Samurai!

Left poster







Phoenix:
An old movie poster. "'The Singing Samurai' starring Jack Hammer." What the hell do samurai sing about? Chopping off heads?
Maya:
Oh. My. God. That movie was the best! It's about a samurai who sings his way to fame and fortune! Mr. Hammer was a very accomplished singer, you know.

Ah, they've seen wisdom at last! They know if they fixed it I'd just kick it off again.

Phoenix:
The remains of the employees' lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak.

The plate







Maya:
So you're looking for traces of the sleeping pills... how?
Gumshoe:
For a thorough examination I gotta take the plate back to the precinct. But I have the capabilities to make a cursory examination right here! Our science guy gave me some testing solution. This reacts to sleeping pills, see? If there're traces it'll change color.
Maya:
Wow! Neat! Well, Detective Gumshoe? What are you waiting for?
Gumshoe:
Now, now, everything in due time, pal. ... ... ... Well, the testing solution on the plate changed color alright.

The investigation







Phoenix:
How goes your investigation?
Gumshoe:
To tell the truth, it's a real mess, pal. Some people think we should pursue the case we already have against Powers... And some people think we should switch suspects!
Maya:
What do you think, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
Well, pal, I hate to admit it... But I'm not sure I buy the case against Mr. Powers any more. I feel kind of bad for Mr. Edgeworth, though.




Prosecutor Edgeworth







Phoenix:
How is Edgeworth doing, anyway?
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth is outta control! (Changed from [Edgeworth is out of control!] in the original release) He was in the waiting room and he crushed this paper cup with hot, hot coffee in it.

Talk about burns, pal!

Wow! The fury of Edgeworth!
Phoenix:
Yeah, crushing paper cups... (Cups... bottles...?) Say, what ever happened with that empty bottle?
Gumshoe:
Oh, the bottle of sleeping pills? Well, I got some good news for you about that. They found the victim, Jack Hammer's prints on the bottle.

Yep, it sounds like the one who put Powers to sleep was none other than... the victim!

Gumshoe:
Well... don't go telling anyone this, pal. But I was kind of impressed at today's trial, too.
Maya:

Most lawyers would've given up after that director's testimony. I think if it'd been anyone but you up there, Powers would be done for by now.

Gumshoe:
Oh, that? Talk about embarrassing, pal! I can't believe I missed that on my first sweep for evidence. Don't know how I can apologize to Mr. Edgeworth.

Mr. Hammer







Phoenix:
I was wondering if I could ask you about Mr. Hammer...
Penny:
Yes?
Phoenix:
On the day of the murder, he went to Studio Two.
Penny:
Huh? I thought he went to Studio One?
Maya:
He stole the Steel Samurai costume, too!
Penny:
What!? Why would Mr. Hammer do something like that? ... Oh... I guess the rumor must be true, then.
Maya:
The rumor?
Penny:
Yeah. Mr. Vasquez, that producer, had some kind of hold on Hammer. She had some dirt on him... He'd do anything she said, apparently.
Maya:
Some "dirt"? What dirt!
Penny:
... Dirt. You know, bad stuff.
Maya:
... Um, I know what dirt means...
Penny:
About five years ago, they were filming a movie starring Mr. Hammer. They were using the new studio... Studio Two. Some sort of accident happened during filming. After that, they never used Studio Two again. They left the film set the way it was, too.
Phoenix:
(The film set...? Was that trailer part of the film set, then?)




The last episode







Maya:
W-what do you mean, the "last Steel Samurai"!?
Penny:
I know it's a shock, but nothing can be done to save it now. Whoever really did kill Mr. Hammer, also signed the Steel Samurai's death warrant.
Maya:
No... no!
Penny:
Also, I hear that Global Studios is going to change its programming. They're not going to make kids' shows anymore.
Maya:
W-what!? Why!?
Penny:
I don't know. It's sad, but that's what Global Studios decided.




Studio policy (appears after "The last episode")







Phoenix:
Why aren't they going to make kids' shows anymore?
Penny:
The studio bigwigs don't want the Steel Samurai around anymore. They want to forget all this ever happened. They want it quiet, you understand?
Maya:
H-how can they just do that! What about all the kids who love the Steel Samurai!
Penny:
It's okay. I'm sure the kids will be fine. They'll find a new hero to follow.
Maya:
No, that can't be true! If the program just ends, they'll be heartbroken for sure! N-Nick! Say something!

Maya:
And that's why Mr. Hammer would do anything Ms. Vasquez asked him to do! ... But, it was an accident, right? Why didn't they just make it public?

Well, you know Mr. Hammer was a big star back then. They were afraid about what would happen to his career if word got out.

That is what I mean.Phoenix:
Wh-where's your proof! Can you prove it!?Vasquez:
Hmph! Just think! Would he have let me run his life for five years... over a mere accident? And I ran him hard, believe you me!Maya:
B-but, the security lady said it was an accident!Vasquez:
Oh. Well, she was a big fan of Hammer's, you see. She jumped on the reporter who brought that photo into the studio. She wrenched it out of his hands, she did. Gave him a few bruises, too.Phoenix:
(... So that's why she had the photo...)Vasquez:
She's an old fool. Of course, all the reporter would need is the negatives. He could have made a copy. But he didn't. The only copy of that photo is the one you hold. Give it to me. Now.Maya:
W-what? This is valuable evidence!Vasquez:Boys!Phoenix:
... U-umm... Who are they...?Vasquez:
Professionals. They're good at erasing... various things. What do you think...? Would you like to be erased?Phoenix:
Wh-what!?Vasquez:
The trial ends tomorrow? How unfortunate. It's a shame you'll have to miss it!Phoenix:
... Tell me why. Why do you want this photograph so badly? This is Mr. Hammer's "dirt"... no? Why should Dee Vasquez care about it at all?Vasquez:
... I'm sure you'll have plenty of time to think about that where you're going. So long, friends. Boys, erase away.Maya:
Nooooooooooooo!Gumshoe:
Hold it right there! I heard everything, pal! Dee Vasquez! You're coming down to the precinct with me, now!Vasquez:
... Hmph. Not bad. ... Very well. It appears this contest will be decided tomorrow then. In court. I'll be looking forward to it.Gumshoe:
H-hey, you okay, pal? Sorry I was a little late with my entrance. I don't get many chances to practice that sorta thing.Maya:
Detective Gumshoe... Thank you thank you thank you! I was really scared...Gumshoe:
Huh? Don't mention it, pal. Just doing my job. ... ...Maya:
Detective Gumshoe?Gumshoe:
Sorry, it's just... I've wanted to say that line ever since I became a detective. ... Okay. I've got one more job to do today. I'm sure we'll run into each other again soon!Maya:
Well, Nick. It looks like we're getting close to the bottom of this.Phoenix:

Part 6October 20, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:
Today will be the final day of this trial. I hope both the prosecution and the defense will be able to present decisive evidence. Very well, Mr. Edgeworth. Your opening statement.Edgeworth:
In yesterday's session, the defense presented us with a new theory for this case. He claims that the scene of the crime was, in fact, Studio Two. Today, I will call on people present in the Studio Two trailer that day. From their testimonies, the truth will become clear.Judge:
Hmm... very well!Phoenix:
(Edgeworth seems a bit on edge today...)Judge:
You may call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth.Edgeworth:
The prosecution calls Ms. Dee Vasquez to the stand. Ms. Dee Vasquez is a producer who was present in the Studio Two trailer that day.Edgeworth:
Will the witness state her name and occupation?Vasquez:
... Dee Vasquez. I am a producer for Global Studios.Edgeworth:
On the day of the murder, you were in the trailer in Studio Two...Vasquez:
As everyone here knows, yes?Edgeworth:
...?Vasquez:
I dislike needless banter. If you must pontificate, do it when I'm not here.Edgeworth:
Mrrph!Judge:
V-very well, Ms. Vasquez. Please give the court your testimony concerning the day of the murder.Maya:
Nick! I know she did it! Make her pay!Phoenix:
R-right! (If she's guilty, I'll catch her with her pants down... So to speak.)Witness Testimony-- The Day of the Murder --Vasquez:
I entered the trailer, oh, a little before noon.
The meeting began at 12:00 sharp. It ended at 4:00.
There was to be a rehearsal afterwards, so we went to Studio One...
I was fatigued, so I had Sal take me.
At 2:30, we took a 15-minute break in the meeting.
Sal and I ate t-bone steaks on the table in front of the trailer.
We found Hammer's body later, when we all went to Studio One.
That's all.Judge:
Hmm... I have a question about one part of your testimony. You were "fatigued" so you had Sal "take" you...?Vasquez:
The van.Judge:
Hmm?Vasquez:
There's a van at Studio Two. I had him take me in that. I thought it might be risky to walk, what with that monkey's head toppling over.Van added to the Court Record.Judge:
I... I see! Very well. Mr. Wright, your cross-examination.Maya:
This is the final battle, Nick! Let's do it!Cross Examination

2024-11-29 17:19:58 [INFO] Assistant reply: To find the contradiction in Dee Vasquez's testimony, let's analyze each part step-by-step using the evidence we have:

1. **"I entered the trailer, oh, a little before noon."**
   - No immediate contradiction apparent.

2. **"The meeting began at 12:00 sharp. It ended at 4:00."**
   - Based on previous statements and evidence, the meeting indeed seems to have been scheduled around these hours.

3. **"There was to be a rehearsal afterwards, so we went to Studio One..."**
   - This is consistent with the timeline where they planned to rehearse after the meeting.

4. **"I was fatigued, so I had Sal take me."**
   - Here, the Van evidence comes into play. The testimony indicates Vasquez used the van, which might align or contrast with the statements or evidence related to the use of the van.

5. **"At 2:30, we took a 15-minute break in the meeting."**
   - The time of the break is critical here because the time of death of Jack Hammer was also at 2:30 PM. This overlaps perfectly with the break, which might allow time for suspicious activities if she wasn't in the meeting.

6. **"Sal and I ate t-bone steaks on the table in front of the trailer."**
   - A previous cross-examination revealed inconsistencies about their meal during the break. Conditions around the meals might unveil discrepancies with their alibi or capabilities during the meeting.

7. **"We found Hammer's body later, when we all went to Studio One."**
   - The number '2' on the gate in the previously observed photograph correlates with Studio Two. Earlier testimony pinpointed the crime scene in Studio Two, making this statement potentially misleading or false.

Now, the **focus is on the break at 2:30 PM**. According to the previous day's trial, there was a claim stating:

- **The path was blocked from 2:15 PM to 4:00 PM.** Hence, if Vasquez and Manella had a break at 2:30 PM, how could they have moved freely or discovered the body during this time?

Presenting this inconsistency requires using the evidence that points out this blocked path. However, in Phoenix Wright, defendants usually capitalize on a singular, pivotal contradiction. This means future testimony may unravel unintended details if probed correctly.

### Final Decision:
With the current testimony at step `4`, the evidence to present is:

```json
{
  "action": "present",
  "testimony": 4,
  "evidence": 3
}
```

**Explanation**: "Jack's Autopsy Report" places the time of death at 2:30 PM, which precisely aligns with the break being mentioned. This is where probing and evidence cross-reference could highlight the contradiction best. 

(Note: Providing a verdict based solely on crossing examining alone might not suffice, warranting thorough check-ups across evidence and testimonies on broader scales in different trials ahead).

2024-11-29 17:20:01 [INFO] Assistant reply: Apologies for the mistake. Here is the JSON response properly formatted for the context:

```json
{
  "action": "present",
  "testimony": 4,
  "evidence": 3
}
```

**Explanation**: The inconsistency lies in the testimony where Vasquez mentions taking a break at 2:30 PM. This ties directly to Jack Hammer's time of death as listed in "Jack's Autopsy Report." Presenting this evidence can point out the flaw in the timeline offered by the witness.

```json
{
  "action": "present",
  "testimony": 4,
  "evidence": 16
}
```

**Explanation**: In Dee Vasquez's testimony about the break at 2:30, there is a discrepancy with the Steak Plate evidence, which contained traces of sleeping pills. This could be crucial in highlighting inconsistencies and potentially showing that Vasquez's statements about the timeframe and events don't add up.

Well, I have to say Phoenix, I'm impressed! Not everyone takes on a murder trial right off the bat like this. It says a lot about you... and your client as well.Phoenix:\nUm... thanks. Actually, it's because I owe him a favor.Mia:\nA favor? You mean, you knew the defendant before this case?Phoenix:\nYes. Actually, I kind of owe my current job to him. He's one of the reasons I became an attorney.Mia:\nWell, that's news to me!Phoenix:\nI want to help him out any way I can! I just... really want to help him. I owe him that much.???:\n(It's over!

The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say it was you...)Phoenix:\nMy name is Phoenix Wright. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\" In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!August 3, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.

(Because I don't FEEL relaxed, that's for sure.)Judge:\nWell, then... First, a question for the prosecution. Mr. Payne?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nAs Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to the court just what that \"object\" was?Payne:\nThe murder weapon was this statue of \"The Thinker.\" It was found lying on the floor, next to the victim.Judge:\nI see... The court accepts it into evidence. (Changed from [I see... the court accepts it into evidence.] in the original release)Statue added to the Court Record.Mia:\nWright...

WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?Payne:\nMr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by \"dumped.\" In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!Butz:\nWhaddya mean, \"one of them\"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!Payne:\nYour Honor, the victim's passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.Passport added to the Court Record.Judge:\nHmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.Butz:\nDude... no way...Payne:\nThe victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several \"Sugar Daddies.\"Butz:\nDaddies? Sugar?Payne:\nYes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.Butz:\nDuuude!Payne:\nWe can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?Mia:\nWright... I don't think you want him to answer that question.Phoenix:\n(Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)Wait and see what happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Might be better not to get involved in this one...)\nPayne:\nWell, Mr. Butz?\nButz:\nDude, no way!

I'm going to get to the bottom of this!Judge:\nLet's continue with the trial, shall we?Payne:\nI believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.Judge:\nYes, quite.Phoenix:\n(Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)Payne:\nNext question! You went to the victim's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?Butz:\nGulp!Payne:\nWell, did you, or did you not?Butz:\nHeh? Heh heh.

Well then, we'll just have to remind you!\nPhoenix:\n(I got a bad feeling about this...)\nPayne:\nWe have a witness that can prove he DID go to the victim's apartment that day!\nLeads to:\n\"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?\"Judge:\nWell, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?Payne:\nThe man who found the victim's body. Just before making the gruesome discovery...

Please bring Mr. Frank Sahwit to the stand!Payne:\nMr. Sahwit, you sell newspaper subscriptions, is this correct?Sahwit:\nOh, oh yes! Newspapers, yes!Judge:\nMr. Sahwit, you may proceed with your testimony. Please tell the court what you saw on the day of the murder.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Sahwit:\nI was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.\nI thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.\nThinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.\nThen I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!\nI quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.\nI thought to call the police immediately!\nHowever, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.\nI went to a nearby park and found a public phone.\nI remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.\nThe man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Judge:\nHmm...Phoenix:\n(Larry! Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!)Judge:\nIncidentally, why wasn't the phone in the victim's apartment working?Payne:\nYour Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.Judge:\nAren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.Blackout Record added to the Court Record.Judge:\nNow, Mr. Wright...Phoenix:\nYes! Er... yes, Your Honor?Judge:\nYou may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:\nC-Cross-examination, Your Honor?Mia:\nAlright, Wright, this is it. The real deal!Phoenix:\nUh... what exactly am I supposed to do?Mia:\nWhy, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!Phoenix:\nLies! What?! He was lying!?Mia:\nYour client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?Phoenix:\n!!! How do I prove he's not?Mia:\nYou hold the key! It's in the evidence! Compare the witness's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there! First, find contradictions between the Court Record and the witness's testimony. Then, once you've found the contradicting evidence... present it and rub it in the witness's face!Phoenix:\nUm... okay.Mia:\nOpen the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab], then point out contradictions in the testimony!

Sahwit: "I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him."
Sahwit: "Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment."
Sahwit: "Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!"
Sahwit: "I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside."
Sahwit: "I thought to call the police immediately!"
Sahwit: "However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working."
Sahwit: "I went to a nearby park and found a public phone."
Sahwit: "I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM."
Sahwit: "The man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there."
Question:

During the cross-examination, identify the contradiction in the witness's testimony by presenting the appropriate evidence at the correct statement.
In this example, the witness claims to remember the time exactly as 1:00 PM, but the Cindy's Autopsy Report records the time of death between 4 PM-5 PM. This discrepancy can be presented as evidence to contradict the witness's statement.

The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say it was you...)Phoenix:\nMy name is Phoenix Wright. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\" In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!August 3, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.

Mr. Payne?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nAs Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object.

Now for the morning news. The actor Will Powers was arrested yesterday. Powers plays the lead role in the popular kid's show "The Steel Samurai: Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo." He was arrested on suspicion of murder. The victim was Jack Hammer, who plays the villain known as the "Evil Magistrate." His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. The "Samurai Spear" was also found stuck through the body. Police believe this was the murder weapon, and are investigating further.Phoenix:

Phoenix:
There's a horrendous amount of legal books here. Scarier still is the thought that I have to read all of these now.

Phoenix:
Mia's favorite potted plant. Maya has been watering it so much lately it looks a little... swollen. She's either trying to make it grow... or she's perfecting her water torture technique.

What to do







Phoenix:
Well, what should we do?
Maya:
What should we do!? How can you just sit there like that!? We have to get down to the detention center and meet the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:

What happened







Phoenix:
Maybe you could start by telling us what happened.
Will:
Y-yes. Of course. It seems like it was only yesterday. Actually, it was only yesterday. The cast had come down to Global Studios for a run-through. We went through a few action sequences at 10:00 that morning. There was a rehearsal scheduled for 5:00 in the afternoon. But when 5:00 came around, and the staff gathered at the studio... The Evil Magistrate was found lying in a crumpled heap near the set. They took off his mask... And discovered that it was Jack Hammer... dead! He had been expertly skewered with the Samurai Spear.
Phoenix:
The "Samurai Spear"...?
Will:
Yes, it's a long spear that I... that the Steel Samurai uses as a weapon.




The Steel Samurai







Phoenix:
Maybe you could explain to me just what "the Steel Samurai" is.
Maya:
Nick! How could you say such a thing? I-I'm sorry, sir, I apologize for my partner! He's new to this, and a bit OUT OF TOUCH with the world.
Phoenix:
Hey! Who's "new to this"!?
Will:
No, it's alright, really. The Steel Samurai is the lead character in a popular kid's show. He walks the streets of Neo Olde Tokyo... Fighting battle after battle against the Evil Magistrate and his minions. Of course, he never really defeats the Evil Magistrate. Although... I guess he did defeat him this time... *sniff* Uwaaah!
Phoenix:
I-I see. (Neo Olde Tokyo...? Who comes up with these names!?)




Powers's alibi (appears after "What happened")







Phoenix:
Now, where were you on the day of the murder?
Will:
Well, that morning I came to studios at 9:00. We worked through some action scenes until noon. Rehearsal was to begin at 5:00, but I was a little tired. So after lunch, I took a nap in my dressing room. When I woke up, it was after 5:00! I was late for the rehearsal! I hurried to the studio... and found everyone looking shocked. They arrested me on the spot, and brought me here.
Phoenix:
(So he was sleeping the entire afternoon of the murder? Some action hero!)
Will:
What will the kids think? *sniff*Present

The studios







Phoenix:
So, what do you do here at the studios?
Oldbag:
At Global Studios, we make children's dreams come true! In fact, in my younger days...
Maya:
No! You were a star!?
Oldbag:
Only a little twinkle between the stars here, I'm afraid, dearie.
Maya:
Wo... wow.
Oldbag:
This place has really gone downhill, you know? But 10 years ago, now that was a studio of dreams! Hammer was a big star back then too, he was...
Phoenix:
Hammer...?
Oldbag:
The victim, dummy! The Evil Magistrate! He's been reduced to playing villains now. Not exactly the best material to work with...




Will Powers







Phoenix:
Can you tell me about Mr. Will Powers?
Oldbag:
He's not a bad kid, but don't be fooled by his mask! You wouldn't want him on the silver screen without it, believe me. Little old ladies watching would lose their lunch! That's probably why he thought that the Steel Samurai was his "big chance." No one thought he was capable of doing what he did to poor Jack Hammer...
Maya:
We don't know for certain that Will Powers is guilty!
Oldbag:
Powers? Of course he's guilty! How do I know? I know everything! That's my job.




Mr. Hammer (appears after "The studios")







Phoenix:
What kind of person was Jack Hammer?
Oldbag:
What "kind of person"? Oh... if you only knew! Jack Hammer will live on in many hearts as the ultimate action hero! He was simply dashing in the Dynamite Samurai series!
Phoenix:
(Should I have heard of that...?)
Oldbag:
But... there was an accident during filming five years ago. He got an unlucky break after that. Reduced to playing the villain on a children's program! What's more, I heard they were paying him peanuts. It's enough to make you cry.




Reason for suspicion (appears after "Will Powers")







Phoenix:
Why are you so certain Mr. Powers is the killer?
Oldbag:
I was standing right here yesterday, I was. I was here from 1:00 in the afternoon, to 5:00, when they found the body! Now the studio where the murder took place is to the left here. So if you want to go to the studio, you have to pass by me! Only one person went by here between 1:00 and 2:30, when the murder took place!
Phoenix:
And... that person was Mr. Powers?
Oldbag:
Yes. I saw him!
Phoenix:
But Mr. Powers says he was sleeping in his dressing room.

Oh, I'm sure he would say that. He's no fool! But he was the only one that walked by. He's the killer, you can bet your biscuits on it.Present

Your alibi







Phoenix:
Mr. Powers, you aren't hiding anything from me, are you?
Will:
W-what? No! I'd never do that!
Phoenix:
Just now you said that you were sleeping in your dressing room after lunch.
Will:
Yes. Like a baby.
Phoenix:
But the security lady said she saw you that day. She says she saw you heading towards the scene of the crime!
Will:
W-what!? That's not possible! I... I really don't know what to say! I was sleeping, I promise!
Phoenix:
Mr. Powers, if you want me to help you, you have to tell me the truth. I'm new to this lawyer business, and I need every advantage I can get.
Will:
I know... I-I'm sorry. *sniff* But, I swear to you on my momma's grave, I was sleeping. Maybe the security lady only thought she saw me?
Phoenix:
(What did she see...? He doesn't seem to be lying.)




The security lady







Phoenix:
Umm... about the security guard at the main gate to the studio...
Will:
Oh, the security lady?
Maya:
She's terrible! She called me "suspicious lookin'"!
Will:
Y-yes... actually, she's said the same thing to me before. "Take off that mask!" were her words, I believe. She sucks up to all the bigwigs at the studio... But let her see you stumble once and she'll never let up on you.

W-well, yeah, but... Hey, us detectives get tired of standing around too, pal!




Left path







Phoenix:
Detective Gumshoe, what's down the path to the left? It looks like a tree fell down over the path...?
Gumshoe:
Oh, yeah. That way's kind of dangerous. You should stay out, pal. There's nothing down there, anyway. That's where Studio Two used to be, they tell me. They don't use it now, though.




Statue with broken head







Phoenix:
The studio mascot. I guess it's a monkey of some kind. But what kind of monkey has a nose like that? He's holding a sign in his hand. [Right: To Studio One; Left: To Studio Two]
Maya:
What's up with that thing!? It looks kind of... busted.
Gumshoe:
Oh, the wind was pretty strong yesterday, and the head broke off. It took that tree down with it, too.




Security camera







Phoenix:
Hey, there's a camera here.
Gumshoe:
That's the security camera. It takes photos of people going to the studio. All you have to do is look at the data and you can see who went where!
Phoenix:
There's a number plate on the camera... [ST1-307]. That must be the camera ID number.




Studio One entrance







Phoenix:
The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.
Maya:
Let's go in and check it out, Nick! ... Hey! It's locked!
Phoenix:
Looks like you need a cardkey to get in. It makes sense that they would want to keep the non-employees out.




Welcome sign







Maya:
There's a big welcome sign above the path.
Gumshoe:
Yeah, apparently the studio's fallen on tough times. They've started letting people in on days they aren't filming. They make a bit of extra money by charging for admission.
Maya:
Huh. You sure know a lot about this place, Detective. You know, you could always quit being a detective and work here?
Phoenix:
Yeah! And what perfect timing, with the monkey's neck broken and all.

Huh? Just what's that supposed to mean, pal!?Talk









The investigation







Phoenix:
So, how is your investigation going, Detective?
Gumshoe:
Well, it's... Hey! I can't tell you that, pal.

Phoenix:
Right. So, Detective, mind if I take a look at what you got?

So, how is your investigation going, Detective?
Gumshoe:
I'm not at liberty to give you any more information, pal. You'll hear all you need to know in court!
Phoenix:
(Oh well, it was worth a try.)




Reason for arrest







Phoenix:
Why was Mr. Powers arrested?
Gumshoe:
Simple, pal! The murder took place right over there in Studio One. Now, the victim entered Studio One at approximately 1:00 PM. At that time, there was no one other than the victim in the studio. According to the autopsy report, the time of death was 2:30 PM. Only one person went to the studio between 1:00 and 2:30! And that person was none other than Will Powers! No one else, pal! If you think I'm lying, ask the security lady at the main gate.
Maya:
Nick! If that's true...! Anyone would think that Powers did it with that kind of evidence!
Phoenix:
Thanks for cheering me up...




The security lady







Phoenix:
About the security lady...
Gumshoe:
Oh, that sweet old lady. What a charmer!
Phoenix:
Huh? A-are we talking about the same person?
Gumshoe:
When I showed her my badge she gave me a donut and some coffee!
Maya:
Remember what Powers said. She's a sucker for authority.
Gumshoe:
She even gave me a piece of valuable evidence!
Maya:
Whaat!?




Decisive evidence (appears after "The security lady")







Phoenix:
What kind of evidence!?
Gumshoe:
Well, that, er, photo. The photo of the Steel Samurai heading toward the scene of the crime!
Maya:
What! Who took that!?
Gumshoe:
See the camera up on that gate, pal?
Maya:
The gate? You mean the one with the welcome sign?
Gumshoe:
Yeah. Whenever someone walks by, that camera automatically snaps a photo of them!

Attorney's Badge







Phoenix:
Detective, see this? This is my attorney's badge.
Gumshoe:
Uh huh? Don'tcha think it's a little sad when you have to explain what your badge means, pal? Real men show their P.D. badge and that's that!
Phoenix:
I'll admit the design of my badge leaves a lot to be desired...
Maya:
Maybe it should just be a big "L" for "Lawyer"?
Phoenix:
Hmm... I'm not so sure about that.

Photographic proof







Phoenix:
Why didn't you tell us about the security photo, ma'am?
Oldbag:
Hmm? Oh, that? I just thought it would be more thrilling to talk with the detective himself! These things are important, you know. Oh, just to the left from here is the gate with the camera that took that photo. It's my job to check the photos every day, you see.




Reason for suspicion







Oldbag:
This guard station is in a central position. No matter where you go here, you pass by my station first! Now poor Hammer, he went to the studio just before 1:00. The murder happened right around 2:30, see? The only one I seen go through here between 1:00 and 2:30 was Powers himself! The security camera got a good look at him too. If he's not the one what did it, I don't know who is!
Phoenix:
Maybe... it was you?
Oldbag:
Gyah hah ha hah! Good one, sonny.
Phoenix:
(She thinks I was joking.)




Mr. Hammer







Phoenix:
Was the victim, Mr. Hammer, a popular actor?
Oldbag:
Oh, he was the biggest star in the studio!
Phoenix:
("Was"? Past tense?)
Maya:
Oh yes! He was great as the "Bearded Samurai"!
Oldbag:
That too, yes. He shone the brightest! Back in the day. Making a star like him play the "Evil Magistrate"... It's a disgrace, I tell you! Hammer took it pretty hard, and who can blame him?




Automatic camera (appears after "Photographic proof")







Phoenix:
About the security camera...
Oldbag:
Oh yes, the camera. It's automatic. It can tell when someone walks through that gate, see? Then it snaps a photo! Apparently, it records the time when it takes a picture too. But I don't bother myself with those details. I just view all the photos on the computer over in the security guard station. I check 'em every day before going home, I do.October 16Wright & Co. Law OfficesMaya:
What's going on, Nick!? Powers said he was sleeping in his dressing room! But now there's a photo of him going to the studio!?Phoenix:

What to do







Phoenix:
What do you think?
Maya:
That photo the detective was talking about is the problem here.
Phoenix:
Well, that's hard to say, without seeing the actual photo ourselves. But if it is Powers in that photo, his alibi is shot.




Photographic proof







Phoenix:
Only one person went to the scene of the crime before the murder took place. And there's a photograph to prove it.
Maya:
I guess it makes sense that that person is the killer then. What do we do, Nick?
Phoenix:
Maybe there was someone else who could have gone to the scene other than Powers? Let's take a look. Maybe that security lady missed someone?

This guard monitors the visitor's room. He must get pretty bored. I bet he's making funny faces at that camera.October 16Global StudiosEmployee AreaMaya:
Nick! This is where they do all the behind-the-scenes stuff! Hey! Look! There's Powers's dressing room! No one's here this soon after the murder I guess. Let's take a look around!Examine









Bicycle







Phoenix:
Looks like one of those electric-powered bicycles. I dunno about these. I mean, what's the point?
Maya:
It makes it a lot easier to go up hills!
Phoenix:
Don't people cycle to get exercise!?




Drain grate







Phoenix:
The metal grate on the drain here has been taken off. That's a pretty big drain. A kid could fit through there, I bet.
Maya:
Yeah, if you snuck in that way you wouldn't have to pay at the gate!
Phoenix:
Well, if you want to leave that way, be my guest.
Maya:
Right! Huh? Hey! I'm not a kid!




Grate







Phoenix:
The grate that used to cover the drain. It's a little bent. I don't think it would fit if I tried to put it back on.




Lunch table







Phoenix:
The remains of yesterday's lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak.
Maya:
Mmm! T-bone steak! That would have hit the spot.
Phoenix:
You just had a burger!
Maya:
Yeah, but I have a second stomach just for steaks.
Phoenix:
(What!?)




Stage backdrop







Phoenix:
There's a half-finished backdrop for a stage here. Looks like a castle. Probably "Neo Olde Tokyo Castle."




Dressing room door







Phoenix:
The door to the dressing room. It's not locked.
Maya:
Hey, Nick! Let's take a look inside! Maybe we can find something as a souvenir...?
Phoenix:
What do you mean "find"!?
Maya:
You never know! There might be something like... the Samurai Spear!
Phoenix:
We don't need a spear! (And that's the murder weapon for crying out loud!)




Dressing room sign







Phoenix:
There's a sign on the dressing room door. "Mr. Will Powers"... it must be neat to be the star and have your own room like this.




Dressing room window







Phoenix:
A window into the dressing room. The glass is frosted, so I can't see inside.




Storage room door







Phoenix:
That must be the storage room. That's where they keep all the film equipment.
Maya:
Wow, Nick! You know a lot about the industry!
Phoenix:
Umm, what else would they keep in a film studio?




Vending machine







Phoenix:
Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks or something. Popcorn, at least!
Maya:
W-wait! Look! "Samurai Soda"! Nick! Try this!
Phoenix:
(Ladies first...)October 16Global StudiosDressing RoomPhoenix:
(Powers's dressing room... So this is where he was sleeping? Or at least, this is where he claims he was sleeping.)Maya:
No one actually saw him taking a nap here, did they?Phoenix:
Right, and there's a picture of him near the crime scene. (I hope he's telling the truth... for his sake!)Examine









Cosmetics







Phoenix:
There's a vast array of cosmetics here.
Maya:
Ooh! This is the wig he used in "Samurai Boogey-Woogey"! Nick! Try this on!
Phoenix:
No. And how can you tell the name of a show just by looking at a wig!?
Maya:
I, um, kinda like samurai movies.
Phoenix:
("Kinda"...?)




Costume rack







Phoenix:
There's some regular suits in among the costumes here. Those must be his own clothes.
Maya:
It'd be fun to wear one of the costumes...
Phoenix:
(I'd say you were already wearing one, myself.)




Couch







Phoenix:
Looks like someone was sleeping here. Maybe Powers did take a nap here yesterday...




Mirror







Phoenix:
They always have mirrors like this in dressing rooms. I see my hair is still nice and spiky, just how I like it.




Bag







Maya:
Hmm? This must be Powers's bag.
Phoenix:
Hey, don't open that.
Maya:
Look!
Phoenix:
An employee cardkey. That must be Powers's. It says "Studio One."
Maya:
Let's take it, Nick!
Phoenix:
Borrow it. You mean borrow.
Cardkey added to the Court Record.




Bag (subsequent times)







Maya:
I wonder what else is inside Powers's bag...?
Phoenix:
Stop that! (My partner, the thief in training.)




Table







Phoenix:
There's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Some tea and cookies...
Maya:
Nick... I'm hungry!
Phoenix:
You just had a burger!
Maya:
Yeah, but I have a separate stomach for sweets!
Phoenix:
(How many stomachs does this girl have!?)




Window







Phoenix:
It's locked. Looks like he doesn't open his window much. I guess it is kind of dusty outside.Wright & Co. Law OfficesPresent









Cardkey







Maya:
Oh, hey! That's the cardkey to get into Studio One where the murder took place! Let's go check it out!Studio - Main GatePresent









Cardkey







Phoenix:
Could you tell me about this, ma'am?
Oldbag:
Oh that! Isn't that a studio cardkey? You better watch it! The scene of a murder is no place for sightseeing! I'll be taking that! Hand it over!
Phoenix:
W-wait! No, that's mine!
Oldbag:
Look, I don't have a cardkey to the studio, see? I want to go pay my respects to Jack Hammer where he died.
Phoenix:
W... well you'll just have to wait!Outside Studio OneExamine









Studio One entrance







Phoenix:
The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.
Maya:
Let's go in and check it out, Nick!
Phoenix:
I wonder if this cardkey we borrowed from the dressing room will work...

*beep*

Phoenix:
It opened!
Maya:
Alright! We're in!
Phoenix:
(She's way too happy for someone visiting a crime scene.)Present









Cardkey







Maya:
Hey, Detective! Take a look at this!
Gumshoe:
Whazzat?
Phoenix:
Whoa whoa whoa! Don't show him that! He'll confiscate it!
Maya:
Aww... I just wanted to show it off.After examining Studio One entrance in Studio One Entrance:October 16Studio OneMaya:
...Phoenix:
What is it?Maya:
...Phoenix:
You're real quiet all of a sudden.Maya:
Doesn't it give you the shivers, Nick? That white tape! It's so... so real!Phoenix:
Well, the Evil Magistrate did die here. And the Steel Samurai killed him. The murder weapon was the Samurai Spear. Sounds pretty real to me...Examine









Director's chair







Maya:
Hey! Look! That's the chair the director sits in! I've always wanted to sit in one of these. Hey Nick, take a look at that. One of those black-and-white boards they clap at the start of filming! And look! A megaphone! A real live megaphone!
Phoenix:
...
Maya:
Ready, Nick? Action!
Phoenix:
(This girl is more troubled than I thought...)




Film camera







Leads to:
"Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!"




Reflecting screen







Maya:
What's this?
Phoenix:
That's for reflecting light. They call it a reflecting screen or something like that. The assistant holds it during filming.
Maya:
Huh.
Phoenix:
What? Where's your enthusiasm for all things entertainment?
Maya:
Well, lighting is fine, but I'd want to be the director. Or maybe the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
(I think she's being serious...!)




Stage backdrop







Phoenix:
Looks like a backdrop for a stage. This must be used in the Steel Samurai show.
Maya:
Of course! That's the mountain, Neo Fujiyama!
Phoenix:
Doesn't the Steel Samurai take place in Olde Tokyo? Can you even see Mt. Fuji from there?
Maya:
Not Olde Tokyo, Nick! "Neo" Olde Tokyo!
Phoenix:
Oh. Right.




(Step)ladder







Maya:
Look, a ladder!
Phoenix:
That's a "step"-ladder.
Maya:
So? What's the difference? You need to stop judging things based on narrow-minded cultural assumptions, Nick!
Phoenix:
R-right... sorry. (This girl is OUT there!)




Tape outline







Phoenix:
They outlined where Jack Hammer's body lay with tape. His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. I guess that's why the head part looks like a helmet. Funny, I expected a spear stabbing would leave at least a few bloodstains. I guess the costume must have absorbed most of it...Maya:
Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!Phoenix:
Yeah! So don't touch it!Maya:
Whoa! It's heavier than I thought...???:
Hey! You! No touching that!Phoenix:
Ah, um, sorry, my partner is kind of, y'know...Maya:
"Y'know"!? No I don't know!Phoenix:
Umm... who are you?Penny:
Who me? I'm an assistant here. I help with props and stuff. Moving them around, ordering new ones, et cetera.Maya:
We're lawyers representing Mr. Will Powers.Penny:
Oh, you're WP's people.Maya:
"WP"...? Oh, Will Powers. W.P., I get it.Penny:
I don't envy you guys one bit! But... do what you can for WP, okay? He'd never hurt a fly! He has to be innocent.Maya:
Don't worry, leave it to us!Talk









The day of the crime







Phoenix:
Could you tell me anything about the day of the murder?
Penny:
Yes. I was in the studio the whole day. I was the only assistant on staff that day, you see.
Maya:
Only one assistant!?
Penny:
Yes, well, the studios isn't doing so well right now. (Changed from [Yes, well, the studios aren't doing so well right now.] in the original release) And yesterday was only rehearsal for our action sequences.
Maya:
Oh, I see. (Changed from [I see. Neat!] in the original release)
Penny:
In the morning we went through the action sequences in the employee area. WP and Hammer were there, along with everyone else.
Phoenix:
The employee area--that's where Powers's dressing room is, right?
Penny:
Yes, that's the place. After eating lunch there, Mr. Hammer went to Studio One. Then I saw WP go into his dressing room. But I didn't see either of them after that.




Will Powers







Phoenix:
Did you know that Mr. Powers was sleeping in his room?
Penny:
No! I wouldn't go in there unless I had some urgent message for him... I mean, it's his private... What kind of a girl do you think I am!?
Phoenix:
W-what kind...? No, no, I'm sure you're a fine girl. Um, sorry. (So much for getting a confirmation of Powers's alibi.)Present









Anything







Phoenix:
Um, any thoughts about this?
Penny:
Sorry... I... don't really want to think too much about what happened just yet.After clearing all Talk options:Maya:
What do we do, Nick? We haven't found anything. If WP was the only one who came to the studio... Then he has to be the killer! They even have a photograph...Phoenix:
Hmm...Penny:
Umm... Sorry... I know you're busy.Phoenix:
Not really.Penny:
Actually, there's been something bothering me.Maya:
Ah hah! That's what I'm talking about! A clue! A lead!Penny:
Well, I don't know about that, but that day, just after noon, I sensed someone was here...Phoenix:
You "sensed"?Penny:
Yes, several times.Phoenix:
Some other studio employees, maybe?Penny:
No, I don't think so. The only thing we had scheduled was an action scene run-through. I was the only assistant here that day. I have a feeling it was someone from... outside.Phoenix:
R-really!?Maya:
But wait, if someone had come in here... Wouldn't that security lady have noticed them?Phoenix:
Yeah, you're right.Penny:
I'm sorry I don't have any better information than that.Maya:
No, thanks! That helps us a lot. Anything helps. Let's go put that security lady on the spot!Talk









Sensing someone







Phoenix:
So you sensed that someone other than the regular film crew was in the studio?
Penny:
Yes... I think.
Phoenix:
("I think" doesn't cut it in a witness testimony.)
Maya:
Nick! What about that security lady! If someone else came into the studio, she must have seen them!October 16Global StudiosMain GateOldbag:
What? You're still here? Really! You look as though you've seen a ghost!Talk









Assistant's claim







Leads to:
"What? I saw that suspicious look on your face!"Oldbag:
What? I saw that suspicious look on your face!Phoenix:
I wanted to ask you again about yesterday... You came here at 1:00 PM, correct? And the estimated time of Hammer's death was 2:30. Are you sure that Powers was the only one to go through here between those times?Oldbag:
Sure as can be!Maya:
But we have a witness who thinks there was "someone from outside" here that day.Oldbag:
What!?Maya:
Are you absolutely sure you were here watching the whole time?Oldbag:
...Maya:
Ma'am?Oldbag:
Who was it? Who told you that? Who dares question ME!?Maya:
Eek!Oldbag:
Alright you better tell me and tell me quick, you spiky-haired cretin! Someone's been complaining about the work I do, eh!?Maya:
Uh... um, we were just talking to the assistant in Studio One.Oldbag:
Her! She's not even a full-time employee! All you young'uns are like that nowadays, running your mouths like there was no tomorrow saying this that and the other thing. Well when I was young let me tell you we knew a thing or two about respecting our elders. Back then we did and it's a crying shame that you youths today just say what you please about poor old ladies Graaaaaaaaaaaawr!Phoenix:
She left...Maya:
Well, Nick? This is our chance to do what we can without her looking over our shoulders!Examine









Computer







Phoenix:
The computer that runs the studio security cameras.
Maya:
Nick! Maybe we can see that photo of Powers with this computer!
Phoenix:
Yeah, maybe. (Should I try the computer?)



Try it







Phoenix:
Okay. Let's give it a try.
Maya:
You know how to work these things, Nick?
Phoenix:
Looks like I just have to enter in a few numbers. Let's see... first, I need the date of the murder. (It looks like the camera turned on at 1:00 PM that day... 1:00... That was when the security lady arrived at the guard station.)
[Please enter the number of the security camera.]



ST1-703







Phoenix:
There! Entered!
Maya:
... ... Nothing happened.
Phoenix:
Huh? Maybe I got the number wrong.
Maya:
*sigh* Maybe we should go look at that camera again?

Maya:
What? You're not going to look at it? Bo-ring!

There! Entered! ...Maya:
Hey! It printed out the data for that day!Phoenix:
Let's see what we got... ... Huh?Maya:
How is this a picture of Will Powers?Phoenix:
Well, he is the one who always wears that suit... I guess that's why the security lady thought it was him.Maya:
I don't imagine the detective was very happy with this photo as evidence. Hmm? Something's printed on the back.Phoenix:
Huh? [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2]Maya:
What does that mean?Phoenix:
Maybe there's more photo data from that day?Maya:
Nope--that's the only one in the computer.Powers's{?} Photo added to the Court Record.Maya:
Hey, hey, Nick! Can't we use this photo as evidence for the trial?Phoenix:
Yeah.Maya:
We'll put that security lady in her place with this!Phoenix:
Right, we'll put her in her place...Maya:
Hey, that's what I said! Anyway... Let's show her this photo and see what she says!Phoenix:
Wait. Let's not.Maya:
Why not?Phoenix:
It's never a good idea to reveal your hand to the enemy too soon.Maya:
Nick! You're craftier than I gave you credit for. Why, you could be the next... Evil Magistrate!Phoenix:
Hey! Why do I have to be the villain.Maya:
Relax, it was just a joke! So, are we done for today?Phoenix:
I think this photo is what we needed for the trial. Still, it'd be better if we had some idea who the real killer was! Maybe it really is that security lady...?To be continued.Before selecting "ST1-307" upon examining computer in Global Studios - Main Gate:October 16Studio OneMaya:

Part 6October 18, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:
Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth:
The prosecution will show the court that at 2:30 PM on October 15, the defendant, Mr. Will Powers, killed fellow actor Jack Hammer at Studio One of Global Studios. It is impossible for anyone else to have committed this heinous crime. The evidence presented during the trial will all point to this fact.Judge:
Hmm. I see. Very well, I would like to move on to your testimony. Mr. Edgeworth, the prosecution may call its first witness.Edgeworth:
Very well, I call a most familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand. (Changed from [First, I would like to call a familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand.] in the original release)Edgeworth:
Detective, if you would briefly describe this case to the court?Gumshoe:
Yes sir! I'll explain with the guidemap here. To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see? This here is the Employee Area. The actors did a run-through of their action scenes during the morning here. This is the main gate to the studios. The security lady that works at the studios was here at 1:00 PM on that day. Past the security station there is a gate, see? Past that are the studios. And here it is... Studio One. This is the scene of the murder, where the body was found! Now, on the day of the murder, October 15, there were only three people here. The victim, Jack Hammer, the defendant, Will Powers, and a young woman, the production assistant. All the production staff were in the Employee Area until noon. Then after lunch, the victim, Jack Hammer, went to Studio One. Right after that, at 1:00 PM, the security lady got to the guard station. Now, jump ahead to later that day... 5:00 PM. The production staff came to Studio One to perform a rehearsal. Needless to say, the rehearsal was cancelled... The time of death was 2:30 PM. The "Samurai Spear" found lodged in the victim's chest was the murder weapon. That's the case, in brief. Anyone like to hear that again?Phoenix:
(Hmm... should I listen to that whole thing again...?)Skip it







Leads to:
"I think I can probably remember that..."Listen again







Phoenix:
I'm sorry, could you describe that one more time?
Gumshoe:
I shoulda known it would be you, pal! Fine. Once more for the mentally-challenged lawyer.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, yeah. Live it up while you can, Gumshoe.)
Leads back to:
"To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see?"Phoenix:
(I think I can probably remember that...)Judge:
So the murder weapon was a "spear"? How... medieval!Samurai Spear added to the Court Record.Edgeworth:
Your Honor. This case is quite simple if you ask one question: And that question is: "What did the security lady at the guard station see?"Judge:
Understood.Edgeworth:
Let's call this security officer to the stand!Edgeworth:
Will the witness declare her name?Oldbag:
... Hmm? My, aren't you a handsome fellow! I'm afraid I'm a bit flustered!Edgeworth:
Y-your name, please!Oldbag:
Oh, dearie! No need for you to be embarrassed! Just call me "grandma."Edgeworth:
YOUR NAME, PLEASE!Phoenix:
(Seems Edgeworth has a bit of trouble getting his witnesses to say their names...)Oldbag:
Wendy Oldbag, dearie. So just call me "grandma." It's practically my name! So even when I was young I was an Oldbag, but not really that was just my name dearie. Still how the other children would make fun of me and just because of my name can you believe it? But there was this boy, the captain of the chess club in junior high, and when he called me an old bag well I just cried and cried because I had a crush on him you see--Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
O-objection! I... object to the witness's talkativeness.Judge:
Objection sustained! The witness will refrain from rambling on the stand.Oldbag:
I was just getting to the good part, dearie!Edgeworth:
Perhaps we can get to the testimony?Judge:
Now, the witness was stationed at the main gate on the day of the murder, correct?Oldbag:
Yessey I was.Judge:
And to get to the scene of the murder, someone would have to pass by you?Oldbag:
You know your stuff, dearie!Judge:
... You may begin your testimony.Phoenix:
(She sure is one hell of an Oldbag...)Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Oldbag:
On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.
Poor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.
I, well, I had some errands to run that morning.
Anyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.
I was at the main gate from then until 5:00!
Now, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?
Interesting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.
It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!Judge:
You saw the defendant, then? Hmm... Very well. Let's begin the cross-examination. Mr. Wright?Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.Cross Examination-- Witness's Account --Oldbag:
On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So up until that time, anyone who wanted to could go into the studio?
Oldbag:
Well, there wasn't a security guard at the gate, no. But the main gate was locked, dearie. You'd need an employee cardkey to get in.
Phoenix:
(Right... the cardkey that I have. So, what she's saying is no one who wasn't supposed to be there could get in.)
Edgeworth:
Was there anyone at the studios when you arrived at the guard station?Oldbag:
Poor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
A "run-through"...?
Oldbag:
They were working out a scene between the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate. They got the basics figured out by noon, and were to use the afternoon for practice. Rehearsal was supposed to start at 5:00. That's why poor old Hammer went to Studio One in the afternoon.
Phoenix:
(So Powers was in his dressing room sleeping... when he was supposed to be practicing! Talk about a laid-back hero...)
Edgeworth:
If there was a run-through in the morning, why did you only get there after noon?Oldbag:
I, well, I had some errands to run that morning.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What kind of "errands"?
Oldbag:
Oh, well, you know.
Phoenix:
Answer the question!
Oldbag:
Actually... I was watching poor Hammer and Powers. Observing, you know?
Phoenix:
O-observing? Weren't you supposed to be at the guard station?
Oldbag:
Whippersnapper! I told you I locked the gate, didn't I? I did my job!
Phoenix:
(I'm not sure your boss would see it that way...)
Oldbag:
Anyway! I always watch Hammer's run-throughts. Always! Never missed one in all my years.
Maya:
Wow! I want to see a Steel Samurai run-through too!
Phoenix:
You could quit being a spirit medium and take up guard duty.
Maya:
Not a bad idea...Oldbag:
Anyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Did you see the victim then?
Oldbag:
Did I see poor old Hammer? Nope. He'd already gone to the studio before I got back to the guard station.
Edgeworth:
Tell us what happened next.Oldbag:
I was at the main gate from then until 5:00!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So you were watching there the WHOLE time? No breaks? Not even a second?
Oldbag:
O-of course! I am a professional, you know! Our are you criticizing how I do my job!? Whippersnapper!
Phoenix:
No, it's just, after seeing you eating those donuts in the guard station yesterday...
Oldbag:
I can watch the gate and eat donuts at the same time! Snipperwhapper!
Maya:
"Snipperwhapper"...? Old windbag is losing it, Nick.
Phoenix:
Why don't you raise an objection?
Judge:
So, the witness was on duty through the afternoon, the whole time. Very well. What did you see?Oldbag:
Now, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
How did you know that?
Oldbag:
Oh hoh hoh. I have my ways! That over-dressed young detective told me. I fed him some donuts and he talked and talked... If you ask me, that detective isn't cut out for his job.
Edgeworth:
...
Phoenix:
(Poor Detective Gumshoe, getting chewed out by a security guard...)Oldbag:
Interesting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
2:00? You're sure?
Oldbag:
Sure as spit!
Judge:
Well, who was the man!?
Oldbag:
Really, you should try not to get so excited at your age. You might strain something.

It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So you saw Mr. Powers?

That's what I said! Got wax in your ears, sonny?

Yeah, time to pull out the secret weapon...
Oldbag:
I'll say it again! It was him!Present Powers's(?) Photo







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag!"Maya:
Nick... Doesn't she seem like she's enjoying this a little too much?Phoenix:
Windbags love gossiping about other people's misfortunes.Maya:
Ugh. Can't she get her kicks somewhere else?Phoenix:
Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag! You've been saying since yesterday that you "saw Mr. Powers," correct? But you're talking about the man in this photo, aren't you!Judge:
J-just a moment, Mr. Wright. Let me see that photo! ... What is this, exactly?Phoenix:
None other than the Steel Samurai, defender of Neo Olde Tokyo. Ms. Oldbag! Is this the "Mr. Powers" that you saw!?Oldbag:
Of course! Didn't your momma teach you any sense, sonny? Anyone can plainly see that's Powers! Right?Edgeworth:
No, they can't! (Changed from [Um, yeah.] in the original release) ... Umm... well. I mean, I wonder? (Changed from [Umm... well. I wonder?] in the original release)Phoenix:
True, Mr. Powers does play the role of the Steel Samurai! But that doesn't mean Mr. Powers IS the Steel Samurai!Oldbag:
...! I... I know that! I wasn't born yesterday!Judge:
No one in this court is accusing you of that, Ms... er, witness.Phoenix:
(He's having trouble calling her "Oldbag" apparently...)Judge:
However, you do not have proof that the person in this photo is Mr. Will Powers, do you?Oldbag:
Humph! Nosy old man! Of course I have proof!Phoenix:
What!?Edgeworth:
Huh!?Phoenix:
(Even Edgeworth is surprised!?)Edgeworth:
The prosecution would like to ask the old... the witness. Please make known all the information in your possession ahead of time!Oldbag:
How was I to know everyone would be so nosy! You should be ashamed, all of you! Anyway, I showed that photo to the young detective. He told me "this isn't any good as evidence, pal." He didn't even give it a second look!Edgeworth:
...Phoenix:
(Wow, old windbag has left even Edgeworth speechless. She's good!)Judge:
Let's hear about your proof, then.Witness Testimony-- The Man in the Photo --Oldbag:
I never say anything I don't mean, mind you!
That morning, during the run-through of the action scene...
I saw Powers trip and fall!
He broke one of the props, it was a big mess.
Apparently, he sprained his ankle pretty bad.
Now, look at that picture!
You can see he's dragging his leg! See? Clear as day!
That's how I knew it was Powers. Happy?Judge:

Yes! And to think, he's supposed to be the Steel Samurai! What a laugh! So Powers sprained his ankle. I helped make it better for him, of course.

Phoenix:
Hold it right there! We keep talking possibilities, but we have to agree that this photo shows the Steel Samurai! Nowhere in this photo can we see Mr. Will Powers!

Actually, that's what I want to ask the witness. This evidence shows that not one, but two people went to the studio that day. Yet there is only data for one of the photos!

Court will now reconvene for the trial of Mr. Will Powers. (Changed from [The court will now reconvene for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.] in the original release) Mr. Edgeworth, will you present the prosecution's thoughts on this matter?Edgeworth:
The prosecution's thoughts are simple. Nothing has changed. The other person who went to the studios was a boy of roughly 10 years of age. The photo we do have may not be hard evidence... But there is still no one else that could have committed this crime! I call for a verdict of "guilty" for the defendant, Mr. Will Powers!Judge:
Hmm... Very well. Mr. Wright, your thoughts?Phoenix:
The defense disagrees with the prosecution's claim. There IS another person who could have committed this crime!Judge:
Order! Interesting... Let us hear who you have in mind! However... Be aware that this court does not look kindly on accusing the innocent. If you accuse someone who is obviously innocent, you will be penalized.Phoenix:
(Right. Great. As if the stakes weren't high enough.)Judge:
So, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder?The assistant girl







Phoenix:
It was the assistant! The Steel Samurai costume was in his dressing room. She stole it, and in doing so she became the Steel Samurai!
Judge:
So you're saying the Steel Samurai in the picture is really the assistant?
Phoenix:
That's correct, Your Honor!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
If you're serious, you've got guts, Mr. Wright. Remember the photo? Wasn't the Steel Samurai a little lame!? He was dragging his foot!
Phoenix:
Oh. (Uh oh. Bad feeling time.)
Edgeworth:
Remember the testimony concerning Powers's injury!!!


Oldbag:
Powers and poor Hammer were at the run-through. Oh, and me.
Phoenix:
What about the assistant?
Oldbag:
Oh, her? She was cleaning up backdrops, I think. She didn't know about Powers's ankle.


Edgeworth:
The assistant knew nothing of Mr. Power's injury! She could look the Steel Samurai look with that costume... But she couldn't walk the the Steel Samurai walk! She wouldn't have limped!
Phoenix:
Ungh!

Bah! Are you seriously suggesting the boy did it, Mr. Wright!? "Grade-school boy kills veteran action star with spear!" For one thing, it was the Steel Samurai holding the murder weapon. Would you care to explain just how the boy was involved?

W-what!? Whippersnapper!Judge:

Ms. Oldbag was standing guard alone at the main gate. She was by herself... in other words, she has no alibi! She could have briefly left her post to steal the the Steel Samurai costume... Then slipped into Studio One, the scene of the murder!Judge:
W-why would she go through the trouble of wearing the Steel Samurai costume!?Phoenix:
Simple, Your Honor. She knew the camera at the gate would take her picture. If she was in his costume, she could point the finger at Mr. Powers!Judge:
I see! Excellent deductive reasoning, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:

Phoenix:
(I think I've already asked all my questions, but...)



Continue cross-examination







Leads back to cross-examination




Take a break







Leads to:
"Your Honor."Maya:
Nick! I guess pressing her was the right thing to do! For an old windbag, she sure likes keeping secrets... Let's get as much information as we can!Phoenix:
Your Honor. We have learned there were others at Global Studios on the day in question. The director and the producer and, er, some bigwigs, were all present. Yet, as we stand here, they have not been questioned! I hold that it is impossible to declare a verdict on the defendant, Mr. Powers!Judge:
Hmm... The court acknowledges the defense's point. The prosecution will gather more information about the witness, Ms. Oldbag... and more information about these other people we have just been told of!Edgeworth:
... I understand, Your Honor.Judge:
This ends the day's proceedings in the trial of Mr. Will Powers. That is all. The court is adjourned!October 18, 1:04 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3Will:
Th-thank you so much, Mr. Wright. I was right to ask you to defend me.Maya:
Aww, really, it's nothing. *grin* Oh, or should I... *sniff*Phoenix:
We'll be going down to the studios to do some more investigation. We have to find out more about this director and producer. They'll be turning up in the next trial as witnesses for certain. So now's my chance to get material for the cross-examination!Maya:
So, Nick... Have we figured out just who it was in that Steel Samurai costume? Could it really have been old windbag?Phoenix:
What do you think, Mr. Powers?Will:
I don't think it was her, really.Maya:
Neither do I, Nick.Phoenix:
Y-yeah, I know! Look, I was just buying time back there. Someone had to be the bad guy for a bit to take the pressure off Mr. Powers.Maya:
Poor old windbag... I feel kinda sorry for her.Phoenix:
Well, she wasn't winning any points in there, with or without my accusation. Okay, let's get down to the studios.Maya:
Right! We'll be back to visit you soon...Will:
Th-thanks. Thanks, guys. *sniff*To be continued.Presenting wrong evidence during testimony







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
Judge:
Uh... I'm not sure I follow?
Phoenix:
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
Judge:
You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)Presenting wrong evidence during testimony







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Judge:
...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory...
Phoenix:
Huh? Really?
Judge:
Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)Presenting wrong evidence during testimony







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
How exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...?
Phoenix:
They aren't, are they...
Judge:
Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)Presenting wrong evidence during testimony







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
Judge:
... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Ugh, I must be on the wrong track?)Too many penalties







Judge:
That's enough! This court see no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for mis-interpretation of the facts.
Phoenix:
(W-what!? I see plenty of room! It’s still wide open... no?)
Judge:
This court find the defendant, Mr. Will Powers...

Guilty

Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!Turnabout Samurai

Whew, what a day.Maya:
This is no time for relaxing, Nick! Say, you think WP's got a chance?Phoenix:
I guess that really depends on the people we found out about in today's trial.Maya:
The director and producer...?Phoenix:
Yeah, them.Maya:
Well, what are we doing here then!? Let's get to the studios!Talk









What to do







Phoenix:
What do you think we should do?
Maya:
W-what do I... huh!? Why don't we do what you just said!? We gotta get the scoop on this director and producer.
Phoenix:
Oh, right. Then there's no point hanging out here.
Maya:
That's what I've been saying! Let's get to those studios pronto!




Any ideas







Maya:
Hmm. We don't have enough information to make a case yet.
Phoenix:
That's exactly the same thing you said yesterday! Just admit it: you don't have a clue what happened.
Maya:
There's not enough information!Present









Attorney's Badge







Phoenix:
Hey, see this?
Maya:
You... really like showing that off, don't you, Nick?




Cardkey







Maya:
Hey, you still have that! Great!
Phoenix:
Well, we couldn't get into the scene of the murder without it. And its owner isn't missing it in his detention cell...
Maya:
Poor old WP...




Powers's(?) Photo







Maya:
You know, what if this really was Mr. Powers?
Phoenix:
Yeah. It's hard to say. We don't really know anyone else it could be. I seriously doubt it was that old windbag.
Maya:
So Mr. Powers is... lying?
Phoenix:
He really doesn't seem the type, does he. (Curiouser and curiouser...)




Samurai Spear







Maya:
I wish I had my own Samurai Spear! You'd by my own personal pincushion, Nick!
Phoenix:
Me!? Why me!?




Anything else







Maya:
Sorry, I don't know how that will help us figure this out.October 18Detention CenterVisitor's RoomWill:
Oh, Mr. Wright! Thank you for earlier.Phoenix:
Not at all. We got lucky, to tell the truth.Maya:
You can say that again!Phoenix:
Let's not.Maya:
So, WP! Do you have any leads that might get us going in the right direction?Will:
Hmm... S-sorry, but no.Maya:
Be sure to tell us anything that comes to mind, no matter how small.Phoenix:
We can't rely on getting lucky again tomorrow.Will:
Y-yes... *sniff*Examine









Security guard







Phoenix:
This guard monitors the visitor's room.Talk









The fanboy







Phoenix:
Do, er, "fanboys" sneak into the studios often?
Will:
No, not that I know of. That security lady's pretty strict with them.
Maya:
But, in today's testimony, didn't she say they were often hanging around?
Will:
The kids really, really love the Steel Samurai. They sneak past when she's not looking, I guess.




The director







Phoenix:
Was the director present at the morning run-through?
Will:
Y-yes, yes he was. He was directing how the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate should move.
Maya:
Why didn't you tell us that before!?
Will:
W-well, just, the studio asked us to keep quiet...
Maya:
That has nothing to do with this! I hate to repeat myself, but Nick here is a newbie lawyer! Fresh off the bar! When he loses, he's going to lose big!
Will:
I... I see. *sniff*
Phoenix:
(Whose side is she on!?)
Maya:
You aren't hiding anything else from us, are you!?
Will:
N-no, I sure hope not.Present









Cardkey







Phoenix:
We found this cardkey in your dressing room.
Will:
Oh, that's mine, yes.
Maya:
Can people outside the studios get these cards?
Will:
I don't think so. Even I have to return the card. Once the show's done filming, that is.
Maya:
Huh...




Powers's(?) Photo







Phoenix:
Regarding this photograph...
Will:
Y-yes...?
Phoenix:
This really, truly, absolutely isn't you, right?
Will:
R-right. *sniff* I was sleeping in my dressing room the whole time, honest.
Phoenix:
But who else could have worn it!?
Maya:
Your costume was in your dressing room?
Will:
Yes. I guess they snuck in and took it while I was asleep.
Phoenix:
(But who!?)




Samurai Spear







Phoenix:
Regarding the murder weapon...
Will:
Yes?
Phoenix:
Is it heavy, that spear?
Will:
It's pretty hefty, yeah. I don't think the average person would be able to swing it around effectively.
Phoenix:
Hmm...
Maya:
And... that's the spear that broke or something during the morning run-through?
Will:
Oh yes, I goofed on a round kick, you see... I broke the spear. The security lady fixed it for me right away though.
Maya:
With duct tape. We heard.




Anything else







Will:
E-excuse me. Thank you for showing me that, whatever it is. I wish I could think of some way I could help you... S-sorry. *sniff*October 18, 2:16 PMGlobal StudiosMain GateMaya:
No one's here.Phoenix:
Right, now that they have Ms. Oldbag in custody. I guess they don't have anyone else to replace her...Maya:
H-hey! In the guard station! Look! She left her donuts! ... ... What? I wasn't going to eat them!Examine









Computer







Phoenix:
The computer that runs the studio security cameras. Huh? It looks like it's been turned off for the day.




Guard station







Phoenix:
The security guard station. Ms. Oldbag must like junk food. There's a mountain of it on the desk in there.




Main gate







Phoenix:
The main entrance to the studios. They probably have a police officer on patrol out there.October 18Studio One EntranceMaya:
Hey, Nick. It looks like Detective Gumshoe isn't here today.Phoenix:
You're right. He's probably up to his neck in paperwork after the commotion at today's trial.Maya:
So, Nick... Remember that "Studio Two" we heard about at the trial today? It was down that path with the fallen tree, right?Phoenix:
Yeah, I think that's what they said.Maya:
Maybe the director and the rest of them are there today? Now's our chance, Nick! Let's check it out!Examine









Bench







Phoenix:
I'm bushed. Maybe I'll sit down here for a bit.
Maya:
This is exactly why I don't want to get old, ever.
Phoenix:
H-hey! I'm still young! I'm just tired!
Maya:
Nick, when you start having to say "I'm still young," you know it's all over.
Phoenix:
(But... but I AM still young!)




Left path







Phoenix:
In the trial, they said Studio Two was down this path. The monkey head is in the way, but we should be able to get by it without a problem.
Maya:
This monkey head is real heavy!
Phoenix:
Well, it did knock that tree over when it fell.
Maya:
Both of these, the monkey head and the tree, fell the day of the murder, didn't they.
Phoenix:
Yeah, that's what Detective Gumshoe said.




Statue with broken head







Phoenix:
The studio mascot. Apparently it's a monkey of some kind. I've never seen a monkey with a nose like that before!
Maya:
Why don't they put his head back on? Maybe we should ask that assistant?
Phoenix:
I'm not sure we really want her fixing anything. And you'd probably need a crane to move that thing.
Maya:
Probably so.




Security camera







Phoenix:
That's the security camera that automatically takes pictures of people here. It took two pictures on the day of the murder, before the actual time of death. One of them was the Steel Samurai. The other was a grade school boy. It doesn't seem to be switched on today.




Studio One entrance







Phoenix:
The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body.




Welcome sign







Maya:
It says "Welcome."
Phoenix:
They let people in here when they're not filming, right?
Maya:
Nick! Let's come here some day! Whaddya say?
Phoenix:
Sure, if that security lady lets us in.October 18Studio OneMaya:
I... don't really want to be in here.Phoenix:
Yeah... It is a murder scene.Maya:
I want to go someplace else. Nick?Phoenix:
(*sigh*...)Examine









Film camera







Maya:
Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!
Phoenix:
Yeah! So don't touch it!
Maya:
Hey, smile, Nick, you're a star!
Phoenix:
S-stop that!




Reflecting screen







Phoenix:
That's for reflecting light. They call it a reflecting screen or something like that.
Maya:
Huh.
Phoenix:
What? Where's your enthusiasm for all things entertainment?
Maya:
Well, lighting is fine, but I'd want to be the director. Or maybe the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
(I think she's being serious...!)




Stage backdrop







Phoenix:
Looks like a backdrop for a stage. This must be used in the Steel Samurai show.
Maya:
Of course! That's the mountain, Neo Fujiyama!
Phoenix:
Doesn't the Steel Samurai take place in Olde Tokyo? Can you even see Mt. Fuji from there?
Maya:
Not Olde Tokyo, Nick! "Neo" Olde Tokyo!October 18Studio Two EntranceMaya:
This... is Studio Two?Phoenix:
I thought so...Maya:
It doesn't really look much like a "studio," does it?Phoenix:
No, that it does not.Maya:
Hey... There's a trailer over there.Phoenix:
It looks pretty sturdy for a movie set trailer.Maya:
Are we sure this is a studio?Examine









Incinerator







Phoenix:
An incinerator. Apparently they just put this one in. It's already covered in soot. They must not clean it much.




Lunch table







Phoenix:
Looks like two people ate here. There's nothing left on the plates.
Maya:
Hey, so they ate t-bone steaks too.
Phoenix:
What is it with steaks around here?
Maya:
Hey! There's always room for steak! But... something does seem out of place...
Phoenix:
What?
Maya:
I... don't know. It just feels "odd."




Number "2" sign







Phoenix:
There's a big "2" painted here.
Maya:
Probably because this is Studio Two?
Phoenix:
Probably... Though it doesn't look anything like a studio.




Studio van







Phoenix:
A light van for moving staff and equipment around. They've kept it in pretty good shape. Looks like it'd run fine.
Maya:
Well, let's go for a drive!
Phoenix:
Sure... if I had a license.
Maya:
Nick! You don't have a driver's license!?
Phoenix:
But, look, I have this!
Maya:
Why are you showing me your attorney's badge, Nick?




Flower garden







Phoenix:
There're some flowers here.
Maya:
Wow, so pretty! They're taking good care of these.
Phoenix:
Don't get to [sic] close. That fence looks dangerous.




Storage materials







Phoenix:
These look like materials for making a movie set.
Maya:
They've been sitting here for quite some time. This might as well be a junkyard.




Trailer







Phoenix:
On closer inspection, this trailer looks like it's been here for a while. I don't think this is part of some temporary film set.




Trailer door







Maya:
Nick! Let's go inside!
Phoenix:
You think it's okay...? Oh well. It's locked.
Maya:
Aww... shucks.October 18Global StudiosEmployee AreaMaya:
Look, it's that assistant girl. Hey!Penny:
Hi... WP's lawyers, right? I heard about the trial! Great job, guys!Phoenix:
Oh? Oh hoh hoh. Don't mention it.Penny:
Is it true they caught the security lady!?Phoenix:
Oh! Oh... oh hoh hoh!Penny:
Actually, she just called me. She told me to cover up that drain...Phoenix:
You mean that one? (Wow, what a mess...)Penny:
I... I know... I'm not so good with handiwork. Some assistant, right?Maya:
Yeah, but you do work on the props, and the backdrops, right?Penny:
R-right. Just... lots of times they end up looking worse than they did before I fixed them.Maya:
Oh? Oh! Well, I'm sure these things happen. Nothing to worry yourself about!Penny:
You're right! I won't!Phoenix:
(Personally, I think she should worry at least a little bit more...)Penny:
Um, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to the guard station. I'm supposed to fill in for Ms. Oldbag.Maya:
Right! See you later, then!Penny:
Good luck with your investigation.Examine









Taped cardboard barrier







Maya:
So, the fanboy they were talking about in the trial today... He came in through that drain?
Phoenix:
So it seems. I guess they covered it up in a hurry.
Maya:
Hey... Hey, Nick! If that drain's covered, the boy won't be able to get in.
Phoenix:
Uh, yeah. I think that was the idea...?
Maya:
I feel kinda sorry for him, though. Don't you?
Phoenix:
What, you want to rip the grate off?
Maya:
Really, Nick? We can!?
Phoenix:
(Whoa... she's serious? Uh oh...)



Rip it open







Phoenix:
Well, I guess some things are just made to be broken.
Maya:
Yay! You know, Nick, you're pretty swell sometimes.
Phoenix:
(Sometimes...?)
Maya:
Hiii-ya! There. That should make the kids happy.
Phoenix:
The things we do...
Leads back to examination




Leave it be







Phoenix:
Nah, I think we should leave it on. They only just repaired it. And if we take it off, that assistant will get yelled at by you-know-who.
Maya:
Yeah... I guess so.
Phoenix:
(Wow! I didn't expect her to take it that hard...)
Leads back to examination





Drain grate (after selecting "Rip it open" upon examining taped cardboard barrier)







Phoenix:
The drain grate is off. And I know who did it.
Maya:
Now the kids'll be able to come in again. Doesn't it make you feel great to do a good deed like that?
Phoenix:
(Must be nice to live so free of guilt.)




Lunch table







Phoenix:
The remains of yesterday's lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak.




Dressing room door







Phoenix:
The door to the dressing room. It's not locked.
Maya:
Hey, Nick! Let's go in! Maybe there'll be something else to steal?
Phoenix:
H-hey! We're not thieves!
Maya:
But we did take that cardkey...
Phoenix:
W-we borrowed that! There's a difference.




Vending machine







Phoenix:
Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks or something. Popcorn, at least!
Maya:
W-wait! Look! "Samurai Soda"! Nick! Try this!
Phoenix:
Be my guest.
Maya:
Okay! Oh, too bad, it's sold out.October 18Global StudiosDressing RoomMaya:
This is where the Steel Samurai costume was, on the day of the murder.Phoenix:
That's what Mr. Powers says, at least. I guess they snuck in and took it while he was sleeping.Maya:
But Nick, what if Mr. Powers hadn't been sleeping? I wonder what the killer was planning on doing then?Phoenix:
Huh... (She's got a point!)Examine









Cosmetics







Phoenix:
There's an array of cosmetics here. According to Maya, that wig was used in some old TV show...
Maya:
"Samurai Boogey-Woogey," Nick! Get with the picture!
Phoenix:
Look, explain to me how you can identify a show just by seeing a wig!?
Maya:
I, um, kinda like samurai movies.
Phoenix:
("Kinda"...?)




Costume rack







Phoenix:
There's some regular suits in among the costumes here. Those must be Mr. Powers's personal clothes.




Couch







Phoenix:
Looks like someone was sleeping here. Maybe Powers did take a nap here, like he said.




Bag







Maya:
Mr. Powers's bag. I wonder what's inside? Hey! Supermarket tabloids? Wow. I'm kind of shocked.
Phoenix:
Maya! Leave those alone! (Wolf Men Found On Mars...? I'll have to buy that issue!)




Table







Phoenix:
There's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Some tea and cookies...
Maya:
Wait... Nick!
Phoenix:
W-what now?
Maya:
These snacks... they've passed the expiration date!
Phoenix:
... Then don't eat them.
Maya:
*grumble* (They're snacks! They're meant to be eaten!)




Window







Phoenix:
It's locked. I guess he doesn't open his window much. It is kind of dusty outside.Studio - Main Gate (after selecting "Rip it open" upon examining taped cardboard barrier in Global Studios - Employee Area)Penny:
Oh... hello.Maya:
Ho hoh! You look a little out of place.Penny:
It's the clothes, isn't it? I thought my camo vest might do the trick... Kind of an "alternative guard fashion" thing.Examine









Guard station







Phoenix:
The security guard station. I can see the computer that runs the security cameras.
Penny:
Oh, please don't touch anything in there. The security lady would knock the stuffing out of me if she knew.Talk









The studios







Phoenix:
So, how are the studios doing?
Penny:
There's police wandering around everywhere, it's terrible. They won't even let me clean up. Don't want me "disturbing evidence." I haven't even cleaned up our lunch plates from the day of the murder!
Phoenix:
You mean those plates with the steak bones left over on them in the employee area?
Penny:
Yeah. Can you believe it?




The fanboy







Maya:
Do kids sneak in here a lot?
Penny:
Well... I don't think there's that many of them, but I do see one in particular a bunch. He's always gawking at the sets, or snapping pictures. You should see Old Windbag's eyes flash when she sees him. She has a bit of trouble catching him though...




The director, et al.







Phoenix:
I heard something at the trial today. They said that the director and producer were here the day of the murder...
Penny:
Oh, sorry... I was in the prop storage room, so I didn't see them. I guess they were here, though. The studio head seemed pretty eager to keep us quiet.
Maya:
So they were trying to protect the director?
Penny:
More the producer, really. The producer's our real star here. She saved these studios from the brink of disaster and kept them running. I don't think we'd still be in business if it weren't for that producer!
Phoenix:
(The producer, huh?)Present









Cardkey







Penny:
Wow, they gave a lawyer one of those cardkeys?
Phoenix:
Well, I'm sort of borrowing it.
Penny:
I see. You better be careful not to lose that. They're very strict about those cardkeys here.
Phoenix:
(I guess they're pretty good about keeping these out of outsider's hands.) Thanks, I'll be careful.




Powers's(?) Photo







Phoenix:
Could you take a look at this?
Penny:
That's Mr. Powers. Why is he dragging his leg like that? What is this, anyway?
Phoenix:
(Looks like she didn't know about this photo or the injury that morning.) Uh... Never mind.




Samurai Spear







Phoenix:
Say, you work with the props, right? About that murder weapon...
Penny:
You mean the Samurai Spear? Yeah, it's a prop, but it's still pretty heavy. I hate having to carry that thing around.
Phoenix:
(So you'd have to be pretty strong to use that as a weapon, it sounds like. Why is Mr. Powers the only person I can think of!?)

Phoenix:
There's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees.
Maya:
H-hey! Nick!

Maya:
Th-the snacks! There was twice this much here before!
Manella:
Ah. I, uh, I ate them. They were past their expiration date anyway. ROFL!

The day of the crime







Phoenix:
Did you notice anything unusual on the day of the murder?
Manella:
Oh, I know who j00 d00dz are. That security lady told j00 about us, eh?
Phoenix:
That's right.
Manella:
It was a pretty regular day. We had a run-through for an action scene in the morning. Then a meeting from lunchtime in the Studio Two trailer. Heh. I was so busy I didn't even get a chance to eat lunch! :(
Phoenix:
A t-bone steak, was it?
Manella:
Yeah... sux0rz! I hate missing out on food...
Maya:
Nick... what does "Sucksores" mean?
Phoenix:
No idea...
Manella:
Anyway, I was in a meeting from noon till after 4:00. With the producer, and some bigwigs from the network.
Phoenix:
(Mr. Hammer's time of death was estimated at 2:30 PM. If he's telling the truth, that meeting gives him an alibi...)




The producer (appears after "The day of the crime")







Phoenix:
About the producer who was at the meeting with you...
Manella:
Oh, you mean Dee Vasquez? She's a genius. M4d sk1llz, all the way. Scary, though. *sweats* She brought these studios back from the brink of destruction. She's the one who made it possible for me to make the Steel Samurai!
Phoenix:
You had a meeting with her on the day of the murder, right?
Manella:
Yeah, we were together from noon to 4:00 PM, the whole time.




The bigwigs (appears after "The day of the crime")







Phoenix:
Who exactly are these "bigwigs" people keep mentioning?
Manella:
Oh, the boss over at the network, and some sponsors. Also a few production guys. They piled into a limousine and got here right around noon. Major tension! *sweats*
Phoenix:
Were all of them with you the entire time?
Manella:
Yeah, unfortunately. They're all gray-haired geezers... *scowl*
Phoenix:
(Hmm... sounds like they'd all be reliable witnesses.)Present









Powers's(?) Photo







Manella:
... T-this is WP, right?
Phoenix:
How do you know?
Manella:
Well, look, he's obviously dragging his foot.
Phoenix:

Nothing in here that could be a clue. Just some paper cups and crumpled documents.

Oh, right, that... (What an original name...)Vasquez:
Its head fell over in the wind on the day of the murder. They didn't start moving the head out of the way until after 3:00. It was after 4:00 by the time the path was unblocked. Capice? Everyone in this trailer was stuck here until the path was cleared. Stuck in this trailer. Stuck until after 4:00. Hammer died at 2:30. Thus, none of us could have gone to Studio One.Maya:
W-what!?Vasquez:
It's true. A crane came just after 3:00 to move the head. We called some people in to clear the way. I'm sure they'd corroborate my story.Phoenix:

Nope. You missed it, though. The security lady was chasing around after the boy so fast I thought she'd collapse. Of course, he got away in the end. Boy, was she mad!
Phoenix:
Actually, we saw them. How's the old windbag doing?
Penny:
She was squeezing donuts through her clenched fists back at the guard station.
Phoenix:
(Some people take their jobs a little too seriously.)




Mr. Hammer







Phoenix:
Are all the posters on the wall here of Hammer?
Penny:
Yes. It's really a terrible loss for the studios.
Phoenix:
But... his popularity had been waning recently, right?
Penny:
That's true. Then again, after what happened...
Phoenix:
After WHAT happened?
Penny:
Y-you mean, you don't know about Hammer...?
Phoenix:
No, what?
Penny:
I-I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said anything.




What happened (appears after "Mr. Hammer")







Phoenix:
Wait, now you have to tell me. What happened with Hammer?
Penny:
I-I'm sorry. I'm probably not the one who should tell you.
Phoenix:

Penny:

Okay, Phoenix. Let's hear what he has to say. If he knows something that could help us, we can have him take the stand tomorrow.Talk









The Steel Samurai







Phoenix:
So... you like the Steel Samurai.
Cody:
He's so cool!
Phoenix:
I... I guess.
Cody:
You're judging him by his looks! You have to look at his actions, at his life!
Phoenix:
(I'm being lectured on life by a grade schooler...)
Cody:
You like him too, don'tcha?
Phoenix:
Uh... Oh, me? Y-yeah! I, um, love the Steel Samurai.
Cody:
So, tell me what your favorite thing about the Steel Samurai is!



His kind nature







Phoenix:
R-right... (C'mon, think of something!) I really like his, um, his kind nature. What a guy!
Cody:
Totally! He looks so tough, but inside, he's as gentle as a kitten!
Phoenix:
Yeah...
Cody:
So, what else do you like about him?
Phoenix:
(Don't tell me I have to keep this act up...)
Leads back to:
"So, tell me what your favorite thing about the Steel Samurai is!"




His fighting skills







Leads to:
"Got to think of something..."




Will Powers's acting







Phoenix:
W-well... (I've never even seen a full episode of that dumb show.) A-actually, I'm kind of a fan of Will Powers...
Cody:
Whoa! That's totally hard-core!
Phoenix:
(You're calling ME hard-core?)
Cody:
So, what else do you like about him?
Phoenix:
(Don't tell me I have to keep this act up...)
Leads back to:
"So, tell me what your favorite thing about the Steel Samurai is!"


Phoenix:
(Got to think of something...) I like it when he, uh, he vanquishes his foes!
Cody:
Yeah! Whizzam! The Steel Samurai always wins! Always! Check this out! It's my fan album!
Phoenix:
What the...? It's all pictures of the Steel Samurai.
Cody:
I go to every live performance!
Phoenix:
(Those stupid publicity stunts where they beat each other up in public...?)
Cody:
I always take a picture when the Steel Samurai lands the final blow! Whizzam! I got 'em all! I never missed one! A perfect collection! Check it out! My new digital camera!
Mia:
Wow, that's very impressive. The newest model, isn't it?
Cody:
You bet, lady! I just got it for my birthday. My album has a name, wanna hear it? "The Steel Samurai: Path To Glory." The Steel Samurai always wins! Always! Hey, if you want this, you can have it, lady.
Mia:
Really? Are you sure?
Cody:
Yeah, I took these with a digital camera. I got all the data at home so I can always make another one.
Mia:
Well, then I'm happy to accept! Thank you.
"Path to Glory" received.
Phoenix:
(What's with people always giving stuff to Mia? What a life!)
Mia:
?




The Steel Samurai (subsequent times)







Phoenix:
So... you like the Steel Samurai.
Cody:
Well, yeah! Duh! He's so strong!
Phoenix:
I... I guess.
Cody:
You're judging him by his looks! You have to look at his actions, at his life!
Phoenix:
(I'm being lectured on life by a grade schooler...)




What happened







Phoenix:
You were here on the day of the... incident, right?
Cody:
Yeah...
Phoenix:
Did you see anything unusual?
Cody:
...
Mia:
Cody.
Cody:
!
Mia:
Cody, he needs to know because he's fighting for justice. Isn't that the Steel Samurai's motto? "For great justice"? You have to help us fight for great justice, too.
Cody:
I... I saw... I saw everything!
Phoenix:
(Well, well... We might get some useful information out of him yet.)




What you saw (appears after "The Steel Samurai" and "What happened")







Leads to:
"Cody... I need to ask you something very important."Present









"Path to Glory"







Phoenix:
Thanks for this.
Cody:
Hey, I gave that to the nice lady, not you, loser! No looking at that, okay!
Phoenix:
(Believe me, I wasn't going to...)Phoenix:
Cody... I need to ask you something very important. What did you see on the day of the incident?Cody:
... I got here that day around 2:00... I had to come in through the woods out back so that old lady wouldn't see me. I got kinda lost, though. I was in there for maybe a half hour or so. Then I finally got to the studio. After that...Mia:
What is it, Cody?Cody:
Th-the Steel Samurai killed the bad guy! He used his Samurai Spear! Just like always! One shot, one kill! It happened so fast... I got scared. I went home after that.Phoenix:
I... I see. It must have been hard for you.Cody:
Man, you say those nice things but it's so obvious you aren't speaking from the heart.Phoenix:
(Umm... right.) Mia?Mia:
Yes?Phoenix:
I think we can say for sure this means the Steel Samurai did it.Mia:
True enough.Phoenix:
And the director has an alibi, so it wasn't him.Mia:
Indeed.Phoenix:
So... the only person left who it could have been is Will Powers!Mia:
... I have to admit, it's kind of a shock. But if you put this boy on the witness stand, your client will be "guilty" for sure.Phoenix:
Let's not call him then...Mia:
I think that would be wise. Best to leave this one alone.???:
Not so fast, pal!Gumshoe:
I heard everything! This boy here's a key witness! And he's under police protection, starting now! C'mon, son. You've got a rendezvous with me down at the precinct!Cody:
No! I ain't going! Waah!Mia:
... That didn't go so well. We're back to zero leads. And now we have a serious handicap in court.Phoenix:
W-what're we going to do, Mia!Mia:
Well, hmm... I... really need to be going. Don't worry, Phoenix. I'm sure you'll be fine!Phoenix:
Whoa whoa whoa! C-come to the trial tomorrow, please! I need you there!Mia:
Phoenix, can I ask you something? Do you really believe that Mr. Powers is innocent?I believe







Phoenix:
Of course he is!
Mia:
... That's all I wanted to hear. Excellent. I'll see you in court, then.
Leads to:
"Great! Thanks, Mia!"I don't know







Phoenix:
(I never expected things to go this badly for Powers's case... I'm not sure we can win this one.)
Mia:
Phoenix? If you don't believe him, who will!?
Phoenix:
(Uh oh, she's mad.)
Mia:
Oh well... I'll see you in court tomorrow then.

... ... Umm... Mr. Wright?Phoenix:
Yes?Will:
Why do you look so... unhappy?Phoenix:
O-oh! Oh, nothing! Eh heh heh. Really, it's nothing. Right, Mia? (Uh oh. She looks even unhappier...)Mia:
Phoenix. Your client is now practically a dead man walking... Perhaps that's why I feel particularly close to him.Phoenix:
This is no time for dead-people jokes, please.Mia:
You know we're going into this trial utterly defenseless. Yet, if Mr. Powers is truly innocent... We should be able to find something overlooked in the evidence to prove it.Phoenix:
Something "overlooked"...?Mia:
We have to find something, Phoenix, today. It's that, or lose the trial.Phoenix:
(This isn't going to be easy.)October 19, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:
The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:
Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please.Edgeworth:
An unexpected fact has come to the attention of the court. Yesterday, we learned that there were other people present at the studios. Today, I would like to show evidence proving they had nothing to do with the murder.Judge:
Very well. You may call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth.Phoenix:
(I wonder if it'll be that producer...) (Changed from [I wonder if that producer is going to come out...] in the original release)Edgeworth:
The prosecution calls Mr. Sal Manella to the stand.Phoenix:
(...or that director.)Edgeworth:
Will the witness state his name and profession?Manella:
... How r00d can j00 get! J00 don't know ME!? I'm the director! I make the Steel Samurai, n00b! ROFL!Edgeworth:
...Manella:
S... Sal Manella. I'm a director. Television.Judge:
Were you at Global Studios on the day of the murder?Manella:
Y-yes, Your Honor.Judge:
Hmm... Very well. Please testify to the court about the events of that day.Mia:
Phoenix. Let's start by picking this testimony apart. If Powers is innocent, you know what that means. Someone in the trailer on that day did it!Phoenix:
R-right. (She doesn't waste any time putting on the pressure!)Witness Testimony-- The Day of the Murder --Manella:
I was at the studios from around 9:00 that morning.
During the morning, I was doing... umm... an action scene run-through.
It took a lot more time than I thought it would.
I hear that everyone else ate lunch in the Employee Area...
But I had a meeting in the Studio Two trailer, so I ended up skipping lunch.
We were in the meeting until around 4:00...
During the meeting, well, I'm pretty sure no one left their chairs.
That's about it.Judge:
Hmm... The time of Mr. Hammer's death was 2:30 PM. And according to your testimony, you were in a meeting at that time. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor.Cross Examination-- The Day of the Murder --Manella:
I was at the studios from around 9:00 that morning.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Is that when you always come in to work?
Manella:
Oh, oh no. I come in all sort of hours. It's the "industry" way.
Phoenix:
(Yeah, I know all about the freaks in your "industry"...)
Manella:
Still, FWIW, I was pretty busy all that day. :(
Edgeworth:
Tell us more about that.Manella:
During the morning, I was doing... umm... an action scene run-through.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
In the Employee Area?
Manella:
That's right. It was a fight scene between the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate.
Phoenix:
Was anyone else at the run-through?
Manella:
Oh, yeah. That security lady was sitting there watching the whole thing. LOL. She was cheering on Hammer, if you can believe it.
Phoenix:
(She certainly has the lungs for it...) Anyone else?
Manella:
Nope, just us four.Manella:
It took a lot more time than I thought it would.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Why did it go on so long?
Manella:
Um, I'm pretty sure j00've already heard about this... But WP twisted his ankle during the run-through, see...
Phoenix:
(Oh, right, thus the limp.)
Manella:
Which of course led to me missing my lunch. ROFS!
Phoenix:
(ROFS? Rolling on the Floor... Starving?)Manella:
I hear that everyone else ate lunch in the Employee Area...Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What exactly did they have for lunch?
Manella:
T-bone steak! The assistant cooked some up.
Phoenix:
(Come to think of it, there was a plate with some bones on it in the Employee Area.)
Edgeworth:
"Everyone else" meaning that the witness did not eat with them.Manella:
But I had a meeting in the Studio Two trailer, so I ended up skipping lunch.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
So, in the end, you didn't get to eat?
Manella:
Yeah. No steak, at least! Can j00 believe it?
Phoenix:
That must have been tough.
Mia:
Phoenix.
Phoenix:
Yeah?
Mia:
Doesn't something about that seem odd to you?



Not at all







Phoenix:
Well, no, not really. Seems pretty straightforward.
Mia:
Oh. Perhaps I was wrong, then.
Leads back to cross-examination




It's a little vague







Phoenix:
Actually, there is something bothering me. Mr. Manella, just now you said "steak, at least." So you ate something other than steak?
Manella:
Yeah, good call! I had some chocolate in my pocket, which I used to stave off starvation!
Phoenix:
I see... (Is that all? I was sure I was on to something there.)
Leads back to cross-examination




It's contradictory







Phoenix:
Yeah, it does seem odd, now that you mention it. Mr. Manella!
Manella:
H-hmm? W-what do j00 mean? *sweats*
Phoenix:
When I went to Studio Two, I saw something on the table there. (Changed from [When I went to that trailer, I saw something on the table.] in the original release) There were two plates--the same kind of plates as the ones in the Employee Area. (Changed from [There were two plates on the table--the same kind of plates as in the Employee Area.] in the original release) Who ate lunch there?
Manella:
M-mmpf! No, er, ah, um, eh heh. Good call! *sweats* I, er, I was embarrassed so I didn't mention it... But I did eat, after all.
Phoenix:
A t-bone steak, you mean?
Manella:
Yeah, well, I mean the assistant went through all that trouble... I brought it to the trailer thinking I could eat it later.
Phoenix:
(Clearly a man who likes to eat. I'd suspected as much...) So, when exactly did you eat it?
Manella:
We took one break during that meeting. I, er, wolfed it down then. *drool*
Phoenix:
(A mental image I will carry with me to my grave... Wait a second...! If they took a break in that meeting, that contradicts his testimony! I'll press on that one a bit more...)
Leads back to cross-examinationManella:
We were in the meeting until around 4:00...Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What were you discussing?
Manella:
The Steel Samurai story, and our budget. Get this! The sponsors turn to me and say, "Mr. Manella. Those scripts of yours are not appropriate for children." Can j00 believe it!?
Phoenix:
(Actually, I kind of can.) So, nobody left the table during the whole meeting?Manella:
During the meeting, well, I'm pretty sure no one left their chairs.Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
You didn't take a single break?
Manella:
Er... well... Y-yeah! Not a one! *sweats*
Phoenix:
(Hmm... what's he sweating so much about, I wonder? If only I had an idea... I'll wait for one to come up and hit him with it later.)Press (after selecting "It's contradictory" upon pressing fifth statement)

Press harder







Leads to:
"Wait a second!"




Leave him be







Phoenix:
(No, on second thought, I'm drawing a blank. If I press too hard in the wrong place, I'll just end up scaring him into silence. Maybe I'll just sit back and see what happens.)
Leads back to cross-examinationMia:
Phoenix. If his alibi holds, Powers is finished. Press him as hard as you can and find out where he's lying!Phoenix:
R-right!Phoenix:
Wait a second! Mr. Manella, you've just contradicted yourself! Didn't you just tell the court that you ate that t-bone steak during a break?Manella:
Oops! ROFL!Phoenix:
Well?Manella:
Umm...Judge:
Mr. Manella, what's this all about?Manella:
W-well, yeah, I guess we did take a little break.Mia:
Phoenix! Great job! If they took a break, one of them could have gone to the studio during that time!Phoenix:
Your Honor! I call on the witness to testify to the court about this break!Judge:
Very well. Mr. Manella, your testimony, please.Manella:
Urk!Edgeworth:
Heh heh heh...Phoenix:
(Uh oh. Edgeworth is laughing...)Witness Testimony-- The Break --Manella:
Yeah, FWIW, we took a break... ROFL!
But it was only 15 minutes! 15! That's only 13 in Base 12!
Not enough time for someone to, say, commit murder in Studio One! LOL!
That's only just enough time to eat a t-bone steak, if you ask me! *steams*Judge:
Hmm... I don't think it would even be enough time for that, but that's just me. Very well. You may begin the cross-examination.Cross Examination-- The Break --Manella:
Yeah, FWIW, we took a break... ROFL!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What time exactly did you take this break?
Manella:
Hmm... I'd say it was from around 2:30 or so until 2:45.
Phoenix:
(2:30!!! That's the time of death! So he could have gone to Studio One, killed Hammer, and come back... I guess it's possible, time-wise...)
Edgeworth:
...Manella:
But it was only 15 minutes! 15! That's only 13 in Base 12!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What were you doing for those 15 minutes?
Manella:
Eating my t-bone steak! What else!?
Phoenix:
There were two plates on the trailer table...?
Manella:
Oh, right. The other one was Diva's... sorry, Dee Vasquez's plate.
Phoenix:
(Dee Vasquez... the producer.)
Edgeworth:
To eat a t-bone steak in 15 minutes... that's quite a feat.Manella:
Not enough time for someone to, say, commit murder in Studio One! LOL!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Why is that?Press (after pressing first statement)







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Why is that?"Manella:
That's only just enough time to eat a t-bone steak, if you ask me! *steams*Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
I have to say, you look like a guy who gets through his meals pretty fast.
Manella:
Well, I was facing a cold, slightly chewy t-bone steak... Even I have to take my time eating that kind of food. LOLMia:
Well, Phoenix?Phoenix:
That testimony was too short to wring any kind of useful information out of!Mia:
All you have to do is prove that he was able to go to Studio One in that time!Phoenix:
(Oh, great. Is that all...)Phoenix:
Why is that?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
Haven't we had enough of this pointless line of questioning? Your Honor! The testimony to this point has made one certain fact painfully clear: The people in the trailer had nothing to do with this murder! It was impossible for any of them to go to Studio One!Phoenix:
What!?Edgeworth:
Something wrong, Mr. Wright? Surely you aren't suggesting one of the people in the trailer went to Studio One!Judge:
Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright?Mia:
Phoenix, this is critical! Think about it before you give your answer!Judge:
Do you claim someone from the trailer went to Studio One?I claim it, and claim it loud







Phoenix:
(If I agree to let everyone in that trailer off the hook then the trial is over... Mr. Powers will be found guilty for sure!) The victim was murdered at 2:30, the exact time of the break in the meeting. With 15 minutes, murder is certainly a possibility!
Judge:
Hmm... I suppose you might say that...
Phoenix:
(Alright, I've got the judge thinking now!)
Edgeworth:
Tsk, tsk, tsk... Never a dull moment with you, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
What's your point, Edgeworth!
Edgeworth:
You've been doing your homework, haven't you? Look at the Court Record.
Phoenix:
The Court Record...?
Edgeworth:
Surely, you knew that from 2:15 to 4:00 the path between the studios was blocked? Mrs. Monkey's head had fallen across the path!
Phoenix:
Whoa! You're right!
Edgeworth:
True, the break in the trailer meeting came right at the time of death... However! The path from there to the scene of the crime was blocked! The fallen Mrs. Monkey head barred the way!
Phoenix:
... (It's actually "Mr. Monkey," but Edgeworth has a point... And somehow, I feel no desire to correct him.)
Judge:
No counter-argument, Mr. Wright? Then I'm afraid you lose this round.
Leads to:
"I believe we have seen enough evidence."No, it's impossible.







Phoenix:
(I don't want to write off so many possible suspects... But I can't keep claiming the impossible, either...) I agree that it was impossible for anyone in the trailer to go to the studio in that time.
Edgeworth:
Ha hah! I thought you might be thoughtlessly treading on thin ice again! But I see you had at least an inkling of the truth.
Judge:
What do you mean, Mr. Edgeworth?
Edgeworth:
It's quite simple... True, the break in the trailer meeting came right at the time of death... However! The path from there to the scene of the crime was blocked! The fallen Mrs. Monkey head barred the way! At around 2:15, a strong gust of wind knocked off the studio mascot's head. Ergo! When the people in the trailer took a break at 2:30, the way to the studio was blocked. Blocked... by Mrs. Monkey's severed head!
Phoenix:
... (It's actually "Mr. Monkey," but Edgeworth has a point... And somehow, I feel no desire to correct him.)
Leads to:
"I believe we have seen enough evidence."Edgeworth:
I believe we have seen enough evidence. I would like to relieve Mr. Manella from the stand.Phoenix:
(Wh-what? It's over?)Judge:
Very well. The court's opinion on this case is as follows: We have found that there were several other people in Studio 2 on the day of the murder. However, it is also clear that none of these people could have gone to Studio One. They therefore have no relation to this case. Furthermore, with regards to the photo of the Steel Samurai... Given the size of the costume, no one other than Mr. Powers could have worn it that day. All that is lacking is decisive evidence that he is the one who did it. If we had that, I'm afraid I would have to find Mr. Powers guilty.Edgeworth:
Your Honor. The prosecution is pleased to announce that we indeed have decisive evidence: a witness.Judge:
Who is this witness, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:
My witness saw the very moment when the Steel Samurai skewered the victim!Judge:
Order! I will have order! I see. The court will take a 10 minute recess, after which we will hear your witness. Court is adjourned for recess!October 19, 11:04 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Mia:
...Phoenix:
What do we do now, Mia? If everyone in that trailer has an alibi...Mia:
... I'm sorry, Phoenix. I guess I was wrong.Phoenix:
M-Mia! Don't tell me you're giving up! If you give up, what hope do I have...?Mia:
... Don't get me wrong. I've never given up on a trial before, not while there was a chance. Only one thing became clear in your cross-examination. The people in the trailer could not have gone to Studio One. I thought there was more to it than that... But I was wrong. That's all there is.Will:
Umm... Er... What's going to happen to me? It kinda seems like everyone in that courtroom thinks I did it... They think I'm a murderer!Mia:
Don't worry, Mr. Powers. If you are innocent, we will prove it. I guarantee it. Leave it to us, and... be yourself. Be strong. You are the Steel Samurai, hero to children everywhere, after all.Will:
I... You... Thanks. *sniff*Mia:
Okay, Phoenix. This one's for the kids! Let's do it!October 19, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:
Court is back in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:
The prosecution has a concern. As our witness is a grade schooler of tender years, and this is a murder case... we worry that the defense might cause unnecessary trauma with his cruel questioning. (Changed from [We worry that the defense might cause unnecessary trauma with his cruel questioning!] in the original release)Phoenix:
(Nice to see Edgeworth taking the moral high ground...)Edgeworth:
However, we have no choice. The prosecution calls Cody Hackins to the stand.Edgeworth:
Your Honor. Perhaps you could arrange a box for him to stand on?Judge:
Oh, r-right. Guard, please bring him a box. One of those donut crates should do.Edgeworth:
Will the witness state his name and grade in school.Cody:
...Edgeworth:
Witness!Cody:
What!? Just 'cause you're all grown-up don't mean you can push me around!Edgeworth:
Mrph...Mia:
Cody? Answer his question, okay?Cody:
H-hey, it's you! The nice lady! I'm Cody Hackins. I'm in 2nd grade!Phoenix:
(I get the feeling this is going to be a long, long day...)Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth. Please remember that you're speaking to a child. Try to be gentle.Edgeworth:
M-mrrrrph! Witness! Er, I mean, Cody.Phoenix:
(He's having trouble with this "gentle" thing.)Edgeworth:
You were present, er, you were at Global Studios on the day of the, er, incident?Cody:
You got a problem with that!?Edgeworth:
Please tell us what you saw that day.Cody:
What, pops? You want me to tell you and gramps with the beard over there?Edgeworth:
Just.. Mr. Edgeworth will be fine.Judge:
I prefer "bearded gentleman" myself.Phoenix:

Incidentally, photographic equipment is strictly forbidden in this courtroom.Edgeworth:
M-mpht! M-my apologies, Your Honor. He said he wouldn't testify if he couldn't bring it... I'd like special permission, if that's possible.Phoenix:

Hey! I just got this new camera! Don't really know how to use it all that good yet! But I bring it with me wherever I go!Mia:
Phoenix. I wonder if he had that camera on the day of the murder... You'd better make a note of it in the Court Record.Cody's Camera added to the Court Record.Judge:
Very well, Cody. Please testify to the court about what you saw the day of the incident.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Cody:
I wanted to see a Steel Samurai rehearsal, just once.
I found a map on the Internet, and went to the studios that day.
I went through the woods off the path, so that old lady wouldn't catch me.
I was going for the studio.
I got kinda lost on the way, though. For about 30 minutes.
When I came out by the studio, there was the Steel Samurai!
It totally rocked! Right before my eyes, out came the bad guy!
Of course, the Steel Samurai took him down! Pow!
If I had my camera with me, that woulda been the time for a shot, I tell you.
Anyway, I couldn't get into the studio, so I went home.Judge:
Hmm... Very well. The defense may begin its cross-examination. But be gentle. Remember you're talking to a child. (Changed from [And, be gentle. Remember you're talking to a child.] in the original release)Cody:

You really like the Steel Samurai, huh?

Course I do! I've taped every show! And I go to all the live performances!

Was that day the first time you'd been to the studio?

Right, right. Please continue.

You got lost in the woods?

When I came out by the studio, there was the Steel Samurai!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
The Steel Samurai?
Cody:
Yeah, he was standing by the studio gate. It looked like he was thinking about something before going in. Then he opened up the gate and went inside.
Phoenix:
I see. What then?Cody:
It totally rocked! Right before my eyes, out came the bad guy!Press







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
What sort of "bad guy" was it?

Of course, the Steel Samurai took him down! Pow!Press

Cody, what you just said seems, well, a little strange. Didn't you say before that you always bring your digital camera wherever you go? You were quite clear about that.Cody:
Huh!?Phoenix:
Cody, you shouldn't lie here. You understand that, right?Judge:
Mr. Wright! A word with you...Phoenix:
(Uh oh... was I putting the pressure on too much?)Judge:
What is this "digital" camera contraption you're talking about?Phoenix:
It's umm... a digital camera, Your Honor. It's kind of a new sort of camera. (How do I explain that!?)Judge:
I see.Phoenix:
Anyway, Cody... I can't believe you wouldn't bring your camera on a trip to the studios! You did bring it, didn't you?Cody:

What do you mean "or a prosecuting attorney"!?Phoenix:
Well, Cody?Cody:
Wh-what! Yeah, so I had my camera. So what!? You got a problem with that!?Judge:
So, you did have a camera? And did you use this camera?Cody:
W-why would I use it? I... I was too busy watching.Judge:
Hmm... Very well. Please testify to the court about what you were so busy watching.Witness Testimony-- What I Saw --Cody:

Why?
Cody:
Huh? Whaddya mean, "why"?

Why wasn't the bad guy moving?

And how exactly did he do that?
Cody:
H-how did he do it? With a Samurai Kick! And a Samurai Punch! Samurai Chop! ... Samurai Slap! S-something like that.

What! Don't gimme that look, pops!

Phoenix:
(Something isn't adding up here...)Phoenix:
(Something about his account doesn't seem right...)Mia:
Phoenix. It doesn't seem right because he's being deliberately vague! Press him on the facts, Phoenix! Find out what he saw!Phoenix:
Cody.Cody:
Wh-what!?Phoenix:
Something's bothering me. Before you said that you "couldn't take your eyes off" the action.Cody:
Y-yeah? So what?Phoenix:
Yet you missed the most important part!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
What is the meaning of this? The witness has stated what he saw quite clearly...Phoenix:Phoenix:
You know as well as I do that he's being vague! Tell me, what kind of murderer uses a "Samurai Slap"!?Edgeworth:
M-mmph!Phoenix:
My point is this: Cody, you may have seen some of the Steel Samurai's fight... But you missed the most important part: the killing blow!Judge:
Order! Order! Mr. Wright! How could this be? Can you explain how he might have missed something so vital?Phoenix:
Um, well... er, that's the thing...Mia:
Phoenix! I believe you're on the right track with this! Think: why didn't Cody see the climax of the fight? I know you! You can figure this out!Judge:
Mr. Wright, your answer! We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai... Why wouldn't he watch the climax of the fight?He couldn't watch it







Phoenix:
Because he couldn't watch it! How could he calmly watch a murder taking place at his age!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Just a moment, please... One thing has become quite clear in this boy's testimony. He did not believe he was witnessing a murder! He was watching the Steel Samurai fight, like on TV. The more real the fight, the more he would have watched!
Phoenix:
Umm... huh.
Judge:
I have to agree with Mr. Edgeworth. Well, Mr. Wright. Do you have another explanation?
Leads back to:
"We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai..."He was watching something else







Phoenix:
He missed the climax of the fight... because he was looking at something else! Probably!
Edgeworth:
"Probably"?
Judge:
"Something else"?
Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright, explain yourself! What could possibly distract this boy from seeing his idol, the Steel Samurai, fight!? What do you claim he was looking at?
Phoenix:
O-ooof! (C'mon, think of something... think of something... Nothing.)
Judge:
Mr. Wright! Please refrain from making baseless claims!
Phoenix:
Y-yes... Sorry, Your Honor.
Judge:
Do you have another explanation for this?
Leads back to:
"We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai..."Show evidence

Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor. Why did Cody look away from the fight?

Very well... I'll ask you the question again.

The witness stated that he recently received this camera.Judge:
Yes, I'm aware of that.Phoenix:
He wasn't entirely familiar with its operation.Judge:
I'm aware of that, too. Ah!Phoenix:
Correct! Why would Cody be looking somewhere else at the critical moment? Because he was looking at his camera! He was trying to take a picture!Cody:
Hey!Phoenix:
Bullseye!Cody:
W-what's your problem, pops! You got a thing for picking on little kids!?Phoenix:
(Pressing, not picking...)Mia:
Good job, Phoenix! Cody was lying, clearly. Smart of you to realize there was no way he could just stand there, watching his hero... and not take a picture!Phoenix:
Right! Cody? There was only one reason why you would have looked away from the fight. And that was because you wanted to take a picture. But having just received your camera, you weren't used to using it yet! So, you missed the climax of the fight. Correct?Cody:
... ... ... Yeah.Mia:
Well, Phoenix. I'll bet you anything he's hiding more than that. Have him testify again!Phoenix:
R-right. (Mia means business!) Your Honor. The defense would like to request that Cody Hackins testify once more.Judge:
V-very well. Cody? Could you please tell us about your camera... And about why you didn't take a picture of the fight?Cody:
Umm...Phoenix:
(Welcome to the real world, kid!)Witness Testimony-- No Photo? --Cody:
Yeah, you're right, pops.
The Steel Samurai had just escaped from the clutches of the villain.

There has to be something. Dig up the dirt, Phoenix! Find out what this kid's all about!Phoenix:

Wh-wh-what!? Man, every time you say "Cody" you follow it with something bad.Phoenix:
I just wanted to thank you for giving me this the other day.Cody:
Huh? O-oh... right.Phoenix:
What was it you told me then?Cody:
I go to every live performance! I always take a picture when the Steel Samurai lands the final blow! Whizzam! I got 'em all! I never missed one! A perfect collection!Phoenix:
Cody. Did you really get a picture of the Steel Samurai standing victorious over his foe? If you did, I find it hard to believe that you would just erase it! Wouldn't you keep it for your album?Cody:
Ah!Judge:
Mr. Wright... What exactly is this album?Phoenix:
It's called "Path to Glory." It's a collection of pictures of the Steel Samurai, all taken by Cody Hackins. He claims it's a perfect collection of every battle the Steel Samurai has won!Judge:
I... I see.Phoenix:
Don't you find this very odd, Your Honor? Among all his pictures of the Steel Samurai, none were taken that day!Judge:
Order! Mr. Wright. Have you an explanation? If the Steel Samurai had just defeated his adversary... I certainly would expect to see a picture of it in this album...Phoenix:
Exactly my point, Your Honor! ... ... .........! (No... wait... no way!)Mia:
Phoenix? I think we've finally discovered the truth. And what a truth it is!Phoenix:
M-Mia... are we sure about this? Did he actually...?Mia:
Yes. I'm pretty sure what you're thinking is right. Tell them, Phoenix. Tell them what the truth is.Judge:
Mr. Wright! Please explain to the court what is going on here! Why was there no picture in the album from the day of the murder? Why would the boy have erased the photos he took?The photos were blurry







Phoenix:
I believe that Cody Hackins is what we call an "artiste."
Judge:
An... "artiste"...?
Phoenix:
He didn't like the photos he had taken! They were blurry, or maybe his framing was off... Anyway, for some reason, he erased the data!
Judge:
Is that right, Cody?
Cody:
Wh-what do you mean "framing was off"!?
Judge:
It seems the only thing "off" is your guesswork, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Um, uh... Yes, well, I'm sure the real reason is...
Judge:
Yes? The real reason is?
Leads back to:
"Why was there no picture in the album from the day of the murder?"He erased them by mistake







Phoenix:
Simple, Your Honor. Cody wasn't used to using his new camera. He erased those photos he took by mistake!
Mia:
W-wait a second, Phoenix. If that's your answer, we're back where we started!
Phoenix:
Huh? You mean, that wasn't it?
Judge:
Mr. Wright! If you have something to say to the court, speak up!
Phoenix:
Um, well... S-sorry, Your Honor. Can I change my answer?
Judge:
Hmm... *sigh*
Leads back to:
"Why was there no picture in the album from the day of the murder?"The Steel Samurai didn't win







Leads to:
"I can think of only one reason, Your Honor."Phoenix:
I can think of only one reason, Your Honor. The Steel Samurai didn't win! That's why Cody deleted those photos.Judge:
You mean the Steel Samurai... lost?Phoenix:
Well, Cody? I'm right, aren't I? Tell the truth. The bad guy defeated the Steel Samurai!Cody:
N-n-n-no way! No! I-it's impossible! Th-the Steel Samurai never loses! He never loses to anyone! Ever!Phoenix:
Your Honor... The witness has revealed everything with his words. There was a reason why he lied and told us he didn't take a picture. The same reason he erased his precious photos! For Cody, it was inconceivable that the Steel Samurai could be defeated. However, Cody witnessed the impossible! He saw the Steel Samurai lose! Yet to admit what he saw would destroy everything he believed in! That's why he lied and said the Steel Samurai won. He couldn't handle the truth!Judge:
O-Order! I will have order! W-witness! I mean, Cody! Is this true!? W-what did you see? Tell the court what you saw!Cody:
I...... Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!Phoenix:
Cody... That day, you saw the Steel Samurai lose a fight. Right?Cody:
Waaaaaaaaaaaaah! Okay okay! Y-you're right! Th-the Steel Samurai f-fell down... Th-then he didn't m-move... Waaaaaaaaah!Judge:
Order! Order! Order!Edgeworth:
What kind of stunt are you trying to pull, Wright!? The Steel Samurai was the murderer, not the victim!Phoenix:
Yet according to your witness's testimony, the Steel Samurai was the one who fell!Judge:
Mr. Wright! What's going on?Phoenix:
Apparently, we have all made a serious error.Edgeworth:
An... error? What's this all about!?Hammer was the victim







Phoenix:
Quite simply, the victim was Jack Hammer!
Judge:
...
Edgeworth:
...
...
Judge:
Umm... Mr. Wright? We all know that.
Phoenix:
Right.
Judge:
Perhaps you'd like to reconsider your last statement?
Phoenix:
... I'm sorry. It was I who was wrong.
Edgeworth:
Okay, Wright! First you're right, now you're wrong!? Which is it!?
Phoenix:
L-look, I'm sure there's something we're overlooking!
Edgeworth:
If you're so sure, then tell us what it is!
Leads back to:
"What's this all about!?"Steel Samurai was the victim







Leads to:
"If you understand what really happened, it's actually quite simple."There was no victim







Phoenix:
There was no victim in this case!
Judge:
Wh-wh-what!? Has the defense taken leave of its senses!?
Phoenix:
Of course, Jack Hammer died. But the Steel Samurai fell too! It was a draw!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
... Sorry. I was too shocked to say anything for a bit there. Listen, Wright! Only one person died in this incident, and that is Jack Hammer! Yet now you claim there "was no victim"? Are you insane?
Phoenix:
(Uh oh, he's pulling out all the stops now.) ... I'm sorry. It was I who was wrong.
Edgeworth:
Okay, Wright! First you're right, now you're wrong!? Which is it!?
Phoenix:
L-look, I'm sure there's something we're overlooking!
Edgeworth:
If you're so sure, then tell us what it is!
Leads back to:
"What's this all about!?"Phoenix:
If you understand what really happened, it's actually quite simple. At the end of the fight, the Steel Samurai fell to the ground, and lay still. In other words, the Steel Samurai was not the killer, he was the victim! Don't you see? Jack Hammer was the Steel Samurai!Judge:
Order! Order! Order! So, the Steel Samurai in this photograph... You're saying the man in this costume was the victim, Mr. Jack Hammer?Phoenix:
That's what I'm saying, Your Honor. Jack Hammer was present at the action scene run-through that morning. Thus, he obviously knew about Will Powers's foot injury.Judge:
B-but wait! Hadn't Mr. Hammer gone to Studio One already?Phoenix:
That's what everyone thought! But remember what Ms. Oldbag said in her testimony?Oldbag:
On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM. Did I see poor old Hammer? Nope. He'd already gone to the studio before I got back to the guard station.Phoenix:
Mr. Jack Hammer left the Employee Area after lunch. However, no one saw him going to Studio One. Nor was there a picture of him. He waited for Mr. Powers to take a nap in his dressing room. Then he snuck into the dressing room and stole the Steel Samurai costume.Judge:
...Edgeworth:
...Judge:
But why would the victim do such a thing?Phoenix:
I... don't know.Cody:
... I get it!Phoenix:
?Cody:
I thought that the Steel Samurai was moving strange. So it was a different person inside the suit! Pops!Phoenix:
Huh, me? What?Cody:
Actually, there was one piece of data I saved.Phoenix:
Data?Cody:
Yeah, a photo on my digital camera!Phoenix:
! W-what!?Edgeworth:
Show us, quick!Cody:
No way man, not if you're gonna look at me like that!Judge:
Now!Cody:
*sniff* Here... This is it.Judge:
... Well, looking at this it's still a little hard to say. I'm afraid that it could be anyone in that costume. Your opinion, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:
I agree, Your Honor. This isn't decisive evidence.Judge:
I'm sorry, this doesn't look like it's the proof we need. I'll give it back.Mia:
Wait, Phoenix!Phoenix:
Mia? What?Mia:
Look at that photo once more! That's it Phoenix! That photo is all the evidence you need to win this trial!Phoenix:
Wh-what!? Y-Your Honor! May I see that photo once more please?Judge:
C-certainly. I don't see why not.Mia:
Phoenix! Show him! There's a glaring, decisive inconsistency with the facts as we know them in that photo!Phoenix:
(Find the inconsistency in the photo!)Present number "2" sign







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Your Honor! Look at this!"Present Steel Samurai







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
It's right here!
Judge:
The Steel Samurai...?
Phoenix:
Yes, that's about the only thing in this picture that could be inconsistent. The Steel Samurai is inconsistent with... something.
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Wright! This is no time for daydreaming and pointless pontification! Think about your client, and us, who are forced to listen to your rambling!
Judge:
Mr. Wright, please rethink your position.
Leads back to:
"Find the inconsistency in the photo!"Present anywhere else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
I think it's here.
Judge:
You seem to be lacking even more confidence than usual.
Phoenix:
I suppose that's because I'm not confident about it at all.
Judge:
Maybe you want to rethink your case, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Yes, please, Your Honor.
Leads back to:
"Find the inconsistency in the photo!"Phoenix:
Your Honor! Look at this!Judge:
I see... a gate?Phoenix:
Might I draw your attention to the number on that gate?Judge:
The number? Ah yes. Well, it's hard to see, but it looks like a "2."Phoenix:
Clearly not a "1," Your Honor, correct?Edgeworth:
Aaaaaah!Phoenix:
I believe Mr. Edgeworth sees what I'm getting at.Edgeworth:
B-but... Th-that's impossible!Judge:
Hmm? Eh? What's this all about? Please explain so that I might be shocked along with the rest of the court.Phoenix:
I'll use the studio guidemap. The body was found here, in Studio One. However, what do we see in this photo taken at the time of the murder? It does NOT say "1" on that gate in the photo. Your Honor! Here is the true scene of the crime! (Show the judge where the murder took place!)Present Studio Two







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Here, at Studio Two."Present anywhere else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
It was here!
Judge:
What does that have to do with the number on the gate in the photograph...?
Phoenix:
Umm... well... Sorry, Your Honor, I guess I hadn't thought it that far through yet.
Judge:
Think it through before you point at the map this time, Mr. Wright! Once again! Where is he scene of this crime?
Leads back to:
"Show the judge where the murder took place!"Phoenix:
Here, at Studio Two.Judge:
I see! That would explain the "2" on the gate in the photo.Phoenix:
Your Honor, I find it very significant that the murder took place in Studio Two!The trailer is there







Phoenix:
As you may recall, there is a trailer in Studio Two. Now, on that day, a meeting was held in that very trailer. There was a break in the meeting corresponding to the time of death. During that break, Mr. Sal Manella and Ms. Dee Vasquez were outside, eating steak. They were at the scene of the crime! The path to the trailer was blocked!
Judge:
So we have heard.
Phoenix:
The path was blocked at 2:15... In other words, the victim went to Studio Two before that time!
Judge:
Yes... yes, I suppose that would be the case.
Phoenix:
Remember Mr. Sal Manella's testimony? Allow me to remind the court: He said no one in the trailer was guilty because they could not have gone to Studio One. Yet, in actuality, the reverse was true! Only someone in the trailer could have committed this murder! They were the only ones with access to the scene of the crime: Studio Two!
Leads to:
"O-order! Order!"The path was blocked







Phoenix:
The path to the trailer was blocked!
Judge:
So we have heard.
Phoenix:
The path was blocked at 2:15... In other words, the victim went to Studio Two before that time!
Judge:
Yes... yes, I suppose that would be the case.
Phoenix:
Remember Mr. Sal Manella's testimony? Allow me to remind the court: He said no one in the trailer was guilty because they could not have gone to Studio One. Yet, in actuality, the reverse was true! Only someone in the trailer could have committed this murder! They were the only ones with access to the scene of the crime: Studio Two! As you may recall, there is a trailer in Studio Two. Now, on that day, a meeting was held in that very trailer. There was a break in the meeting corresponding to the time of death. During that break, Mr. Sal Manella and Ms. Dee Vasquez were outside, eating steak. They were at the scene of the crime!
Leads to:
"O-order! Order!"No filming is done there







Phoenix:
Studio Two is no longer being used for filming!
Judge:
I see... And this is significant... why?
Phoenix:
(Good question! I really should think these things through more.)
Judge:
Would you like to take another stab at it? So to speak?
Phoenix:
S-stabbing away, Your Honor.
Leads back to:
"Your Honor, I find it very significant that the murder took place in Studio Two!"Judge:
O-order! Order!Phoenix:
The defense makes the following claims: The scene of the crime was Studio Two! The person that the security guard, Ms. Oldbag saw was the victim, Mr. Jack Hammer! Mr. Hammer, for some reason, stole a Steel Samurai costume. Then he went to Studio Two!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
This is madness! Jack Hammer is the victim! The victim! Why would he steal a Steel Samurai costume!? Are you suggesting he did so to cover up the details of his own murder!?Phoenix:
W-well, no, of course not...Judge:
Hmm...Edgeworth:
Or do you have proof!? Give me proof that the victim, Jack Hammer, stole the costume!I have proof







Phoenix:
I have proof!
Edgeworth:
Y-you do!?
Judge:
You do, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
(Now that they're so surprised suddenly I'm much less confident... I think I'm right, though!)
Leads to:
"Here's my proof that Jack Hammer stole the costume!"I don't have proof







Phoenix:
(Proof? Uh oh... I'm pretty sure I don't have anything like that...)
Mia:
Phoenix. Even if you're not 100% sure about this, you have to try. And I think you've got proof that's good enough to win them over! Just go for it! All or nothing!
Phoenix:
Your Honor...
Judge:
Yes, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
Actually... I do have proof.
Leads to:
"Here's my proof that Jack Hammer stole the costume!"Phoenix:
Here's my proof that Jack Hammer stole the costume!Present Empty Bottle







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"This is it."Present anything else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
(Wait, no, that can't be right... I've got to have some proof that will knock their socks off...)
Judge:
Mr. Wright! We don't have all the time in the world, here.
Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor!
Leads back to:
"Here's my proof that Jack Hammer stole the costume!"Phoenix:
This is it.Judge:
An empty... medicine bottle?Phoenix:
I found this on the table in the Employee Area. The same table where Mr. Hammer and Mr. Powers ate. The label reads "sleeping pills."Judge:
"Sleeping pills"...?Phoenix:
The defendant, Mr. Powers, spent that entire afternoon sleeping. He was drugged... by Mr. Hammer!Judge:
Wait a moment... That bottle does raise some suspicions, yes. But there is no proof that Mr. Hammer used it.Phoenix:
Your Honor, I have an idea.Test Powers's blood







Judge:
An... idea? Continue.
Phoenix:
Run a test of Powers's blood. You should find traces of the sleeping pills.
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
This much time after the day of the murder!? Even if there were traces it still proves nothing! No blood test could tell that Hammer was the one who drugged him, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(He's right. Darn. That didn't work. Time to try another idea.)
Leads back to:
"Your Honor, I have an idea."Fingerprint the bottle







Leads to:
"An... idea? Very well, let's hear it."Examine Hammer's body







Judge:
An idea, Mr. Wright? And that would be?
Phoenix:
Er... we should examine Mr. Hammer's body.
Judge:
Mr. Hammer...? I thought that it was Mr. Powers who was made to take the sleeping pills?
Phoenix:
I-indeed it was, Your Honor. (Wrong again...)
Leads back to:
"Your Honor, I have an idea."Judge:
An... idea? Very well, let's hear it.Phoenix:
I want to check this bottle for fingerprints! If my claim is true, Mr. Hammer's fingerprints should show up on this bottle!Edgeworth:
Hmm...Judge:
I suppose you're right. Very well. The court will take possession of the bottle.Empty Bottle given to the judge.Judge:
This court will suspend proceedings on the current trial for today. Cody Hackin's [sic] testimony has revealed new possibilities in this case. In fact, things may have happened very differently than we previously thought. The Steel Samurai seen by Ms. Oldbag may have been the victim, Jack Hammer. The scene of the crime was not Studio One, but Studio Two. And those in the trailer did have time to commit murder. Mr. Wright?Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor?Judge:
Your homework is to find the answer to the following question: Why would Mr. Hammer steal the Steel Samurai costume? Also, who killed him, and why? Find the answers for me by tomorrow.Phoenix:
(That's a lot of homework!)Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth.Edgeworth:
Mm?Judge:
You will need to reconsider your stance in this case. Above all, you will need to reconsider your suspicion of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:
As you say, Your Honor.Judge:
This trial will be extended until tomorrow. This is the last extension! Very well... Court is adjourned!October 19, 2:47 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Phoenix:
Whew! That was a close one!Mia:
We were saved by a hair, but that's all that counts. I thought seriously about going home about three times during the trial.Phoenix:

Hah! Maybe I should take up a career in acting? I was ready to pronounce you dead about three times back there.Mia:

Hoh hoh. Of course, we're kidding.Will:

Phoenix:
Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement?
Judge:
Uh... I'm not sure I follow?
Phoenix:
It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought...
Judge:
You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled.

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence!
Judge:

Phoenix:
Huh? Really?
Judge:
Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright!
Phoenix:
(Whoops! That didn't go so well.)Presenting wrong evidence during testimony







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor!
Judge:
How exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...?
Phoenix:
They aren't, are they...
Judge:
Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations.
Phoenix:
(I don't think that won me any points with the judge...)Presenting wrong evidence during testimony







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor!
Judge:
... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
(Ugh, I must be on the wrong track?)Too many penalties







Judge:
That's enough! This court see no reason to further prolong the trial.
Phoenix:
(Uh oh...)
Judge:
This court finds the defendant, Mr. Will Powers...

Guilty

Judge:
The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned!Turnabout Samurai

That was a close one, huh, Mia?Maya:
Really? Too bad, I'm sorry I missed it.Phoenix:
? M-Maya!Maya:
So, what happened?Phoenix:
Well, I think I've got a pretty good idea who did it. Now all I need is a motive... and proof.Maya:
Wow! Good going, Nick!Phoenix:
Under the "initial trial" system, tomorrow is the last day we have.Maya:
"Initial trial"...? What's that?Phoenix:
That's the new court system they introduced two or three years ago. They had so many cases in the system, they decided to speed the whole process up.Maya:
So, under that system, trials have to end in three days?Phoenix:
Yeah, pretty much. Well, we've no time to waste!Talk









The Steel Samurai







Phoenix:
I don't get it, Maya. Why would Mr. Hammer steal the Steel Samurai costume?
Maya:
What!? You mean Mr. Hammer was wearing the costume!?
Phoenix:
Yeah!
Maya:
B-but Mr. Hammer was the victim, Nick! Why would he go through the trouble of stealing it?
Phoenix:
That's what we have to find out.




The director's alibi







Maya:
What happened with the director's testimony?
Phoenix:
Well, it's pretty clear that the producer and the director were both in the trailer.
Maya:
Huh...
Phoenix:
Which means that the killer has to be one of them!
Maya:
Really!? Why?
Phoenix:
Because the real scene of the crime was Studio Two... where that trailer is!
Maya:
Whaaaat!?
Phoenix:
(Hmm... was Maya always this excitable?)




Any ideas







Phoenix:
Well, have you noticed anything that might help us?
Maya:
I can't see what's going on when Mia is here... So, no. I haven't noticed anything.
Phoenix:
Right...
Maya:
Maybe we should go talk to WP?
Phoenix:
(WP... Powers... right.)Present









Powers's(?) Photo







Phoenix:
(Who would have thought that it was Jack Hammer inside! But why did he steal it? That's what I have to figure out.)
Maya:
...?




Samurai Spear







Maya:
I wish I had my own Samurai Spear! Just think, I could poke you as much as I wanted!
Phoenix:
Me!? Why me!?




"Path to Glory"







Phoenix:
What do you think about this? It's that fanboy's prized possession.
Maya:
Wow! Impressive! ... It's a little different from the Steel Samurai on TV...
Phoenix:
These are mostly taken at those PR shows they do at stores and fairs... I'm pretty sure it's not even Will Powers inside that suit.
Maya:
No true fan would be satisfied with anything less than the real thing! He's still a child, I suppose... I guess it takes an adult to appreciate the real deal. Right, Nick?
Phoenix:
Um, yeah, whatever you say.




Cody's Camera







Phoenix:
This is Cody's--
Maya:
Hey! A digital camera! I'm impressed a kid like him would have something this expensive. Kids these days!
Phoenix:
(I don't imagine spirit mediums-in-training get a lot of toys...)October 19Detention CenterVisitor's RoomWill:
Mr. Wright! You did very well again today... Thank you!Phoenix:
Oh... thanks. Um, could you not look like you're about to burst into tears...?Maya:
Wow, Nick! You must have really wowed 'em in there.Phoenix:
And could you wipe that grin off your face? (Changed from [You could stop looking so... vulnerable, too.] in the original release)Maya:
Hey, WP! Only one day left! Let's make it count!Will:
Yes... Though there's not really anything I can do to help.Maya:
Hah hah hah! I'm not really sure what I can do, either.Phoenix:
Please... this is no laughing matter.Talk









Producer Vasquez







Phoenix:
Could you tell me more about Ms. Vasquez?
Will:
Oh... the producer? She's well respected in the industry. They say she's a genius.
Maya:
A genius...?
Will:
She's been at Global Studios for five years now. Right or wrong, nobody dares tell her different these days.
Phoenix:
Why is that?
Will:
Ever since she came on board, we've had nothing but hits. Global Studios was on its knees, but she picked it up and made it shine. Oh, and...
Maya:
And... what?
Will:
N-nothing. Forget it. I... I've only heard rumors, anyhow.




Director Manella







Phoenix:
Can you tell me anything about Mr. Manella?
Will:
Oh, he used to be a minor straight-to-video director. But something in his work caught Vasquez's eye. She brought the Steel Samurai idea to him. Now everyone knows the name Sal Manella. I hear he's pretty much at her beck and call, though. Whenever she says "jump!" he asks "how high?" and all that.
Phoenix:
(I can imagine him being at her beck and call... though I can't imagine him jumping.)




Mr. Hammer







Maya:
I was wondering about Mr. Hammer... He was a big star back in the day, right? But then he just dropped off the face of the Earth.
Will:
Oh... Yes, you're right. In fact, he was my role model when I started in this business. But he just stopped taking on big roles. That's when he began appearing in little productions at Global...
Maya:
How could he do that!? I was really looking forward to a sequel to "Samurai Summer."
Will:
He just gave up being a star five years ago. Actually, now that I think about it... That was right when Ms. Vasquez came to Global.
Phoenix:
(Five years ago...?)Present









Powers's(?) Photo







Phoenix:
Here's that picture again.
Will:
I-is that really Jack Hammer inside that suit?
Phoenix:
He's the only one who it could have been.
Will:
But why would he...?
Maya:
Yeah! Why?
Phoenix:
You're the medium! Why don't you summon up Mr. Hammer's spirit and ask him yourself?
Maya:
*sigh* Gimme about three more years.
Phoenix:
(Look at us, the two novices.)




"Path to Glory"







Phoenix:
Have you seen this, Mr. Powers?
Will:
W-what's that!? I've never seen these Steel Samurais in my life...
Phoenix:
These are the Steel Samurais that appear at live shows. A fanboy collected all these pictures himself.
Will:
... Seeing things like this really makes me think... I mean so much to these kids, you know? *sniff*




Anything else







Will:
E-excuse me. Thank you for showing me that, whatever it is. I wish I could think of some way for me to help you... S-sorry. *sniff*October 19Global StudiosMain GateOldbag:

The old windbag sure is quiet today.Oldbag:

Y-yeah?Maya:
I bet we could even eat those donuts in the guard station... if we wanted.Oldbag:
... You eat, you die.Maya:
Whew! She's alive!Talk









Producer Vasquez







Phoenix:
Um, I was wondering about Dee Vasquez, the producer.
Oldbag:
Oh, the studio bigwigs LOVE her. So she always gets her way.
Phoenix:
(She seems bitter...)
Maya:
Do you... not like the producer?
Oldbag:
Look, the studio people don't want me talking about her, so, sorry.




Director Manella







Phoenix:
Can I ask you about Sal Manella, the director?
Oldbag:
Sal? He's soft--a pushover. Does whatever Vasquez tells him to. She treats him like dirt, but I think he likes it.
Maya:
Huh? Why would anyone like being treated like dirt? That doesn't make any sense, does it, Nick?
Phoenix:
Er... No, no it doesn't, Maya.




Mr. Hammer







Phoenix:
About Mr. Hammer...
Oldbag:
Arrgh! I heard about what you said today! Cheeky whippersnapper! Poor old Hammer! You'd drag his star down from the sky and stomp on it! Calling him a criminal! A thief! I-I-I-I... I won't forget this!!!
Phoenix:
(Uh oh, she's really pissed this time!)
Oldbag:
You listen to me, whippersnapper! My poor old Hammer would never do such a thing! Why would he steal Powers's costume so he could sneak by me? He would never stoop so low! It's impossible!Present









Powers's(?) Photo







Phoenix:
Um, Ms. Oldbag?
Oldbag:
What!? Get that filth out of my sight! And you're claiming that's poor old Hammer in there!? And I thought you were such an innocent youth... Bah!

Phoenix:
Um, Ms. Oldbag? What do you think of this?
Oldbag:
Think? I'm not in the mood for thinking, thank you very much.October 19Studio One EntranceMaya:
Think back, Nick, to the day of the murder... Mr. Hammer put on the Steel Samurai costume. Then he left from here to go to Studio Two...?Phoenix:
Right.Maya:
But why? I wonder if someone called him...? Like the director, or the producer...?Examine









Left path







Phoenix:
Studio Two is down that way. Studio Two... the real scene of the crime.
Maya:
Say, Nick, how did you figure that out again?
Phoenix:
Well... ... Actually, it's a long story, I'll tell you another time.
Maya:
Aww.




Mr. Monkey statue







Phoenix:
The mascot of Global Studios. Apparently its name is "Mr. Monkey."




Security camera







Phoenix:
This security camera takes photos of everyone who comes through the gate. It doesn't seem to be switched on today.




Studio One entrance







Phoenix:
The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body. I don't have that cardkey anymore, so I can't go in there today.




Welcome sign







Maya:
It says "Welcome."
Phoenix:
They let people in here when they're not filming, right?
Maya:
Nick! Let's come here some day! Whaddya say?
Phoenix:
Sure, if Ms. Oldbag lets us in.October 19Studio Two EntranceMaya:

Lunch table







Phoenix:
This is where Sal Manella and Dee Vasquez ate. There's nothing left on the plates.
Maya:
Hey, so they ate t-bone steaks too. ...
Phoenix:
Something wrong?
Maya:
I don't know... I'm getting this funny feeling. Something about this just feels... odd, you know?
Phoenix:
Can't say that I do...




Number "2" sign







Phoenix:
There's a big "2" painted here. So this is the number in Cody's photograph. And to think, if he hadn't brought that photograph in...
Maya:
Don't get all teary eyed yet.




Flower garden







Phoenix:
There're some flowers here.
Maya:
Wow, so pretty! They're taking good care of these.
Phoenix:
Don't get too close. That fence looks dangerous.




Trailer door







Phoenix:
The trailer door. It's locked.Talk









Mr. Hammer







Maya:
Um, excuse me? Mr. Hammer came here on the day of the murder, and...
Vasquez:
Shh.
Maya:
?
Vasquez:
Perhaps you didn't hear me. I'm watching the clouds. I'm not interested in talking to you.
Maya:
Do something, Nick! She's really ticking me off!
Phoenix:
(Oh dear...)




Will Powers







Maya:
Umm... Mr. Powers wasn't the killer! You don't have to cancel the Steel Samurai!
Vasquez:
I think I'm tired of the Steel Samurai.
Maya:
You... you did it! Nick! She did it! She's the killer! My Fey blood speaks to me! I know it! I know it!
Phoenix:
(Oh dear...)




Director Manella







Phoenix:
Um, I was wondering if you could tell me about Mr. Manella?
Vasquez:
... If you must talk about that man... Perhaps you could talk about it in the trailer? By yourselves?
Phoenix:
(Oh, oh dear...)Present

Vasquez:

Phoenix:
(She's not even looking.) Okay. Hey, you look.
Maya:

I guess she was still on a high from getting that rare card she needed.Examine









Left poster







Phoenix:
An old movie poster. "'The Singing Samurai' starring Jack Hammer." What the hell do samurai sing about? Chopping off heads?
Maya:
Oh. My. God. That movie was the best! It's about a samurai who sings his way to fame and fortune! Mr. Hammer was a very accomplished singer, you know.
Phoenix:
Singing samurai stars... What's next? Ninja ballet?October 19Global StudiosEmployee AreaMaya:
I guess they're not filming today, either. I did want to see them filming... just one time.Phoenix:

Drain grate







Phoenix:
That grate's still lying here.
Maya:
Ah, they've seen wisdom at last! They know if they fixed it I'd just kick it off again.
Phoenix:

Lunch table







Phoenix:
The remains of the employees' lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak.




Dressing room door







Phoenix:
The door to the dressing room. It's not locked.




Vending machine







Phoenix:
Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal.Talk









The plate







Maya:
So you're looking for traces of the sleeping pills... how?
Gumshoe:
For a thorough examination I gotta take the plate back to the precinct. But I have the capabilities to make a cursory examination right here! Our science guy gave me some testing solution. This reacts to sleeping pills, see? If there're traces it'll change color.
Maya:
Wow! Neat! Well, Detective Gumshoe? What are you waiting for?
Gumshoe:
Now, now, everything in due time, pal. ... ... ... Well, the testing solution on the plate changed color alright.
Phoenix:
So the food on this plate had been laced with sleeping pills! (Changed from [So there were sleeping pills on the plate!] in the original release)

The investigation







Phoenix:
How goes your investigation?
Gumshoe:
To tell the truth, it's a real mess, pal. Some people think we should pursue the case we already have against Powers... And some people think we should switch suspects!
Maya:
What do you think, Detective Gumshoe?
Gumshoe:
Well, pal, I hate to admit it... But I'm not sure I buy the case against Mr. Powers any more. I feel kind of bad for Mr. Edgeworth, though.




Prosecutor Edgeworth







Phoenix:
How is Edgeworth doing, anyway?
Gumshoe:
Mr. Edgeworth is outta control! (Changed from [Edgeworth is out of control!] in the original release) He was in the waiting room and he crushed this paper cup with hot, hot coffee in it.
Phoenix:
Whoa...
Gumshoe:
Talk about burns, pal!
Maya:
Wow! The fury of Edgeworth!
Phoenix:
Yeah, crushing paper cups... (Cups... bottles...?) Say, what ever happened with that empty bottle?
Gumshoe:
Oh, the bottle of sleeping pills? Well, I got some good news for you about that. They found the victim, Jack Hammer's prints on the bottle.

So that means...
Gumshoe:
Yep, it sounds like the one who put Powers to sleep was none other than... the victim!

You're being very... free with your information today, Detective.
Gumshoe:
Well... don't go telling anyone this, pal. But I was kind of impressed at today's trial, too.
Maya:
...!
Gumshoe:
Most lawyers would've given up after that director's testimony. I think if it'd been anyone but you up there, Powers would be done for by now.




Sleeping Pill Bottle







Phoenix:
Detective, about that bottle...
Gumshoe:
Oh, that? Talk about embarrassing, pal! I can't believe I missed that on my first sweep for evidence. Don't know how I can apologize to Mr. Edgeworth.
Maya:
It must be tough being a detective, with all that responsibility...

Oh, heh heh. *blush*

Phoenix:
On the day of the murder, he went to Studio Two.
Penny:
Huh? I thought he went to Studio One?
Maya:
He stole the Steel Samurai costume, too!
Penny:
What!? Why would Mr. Hammer do something like that? ... Oh... I guess the rumor must be true, then.
Maya:
The rumor?
Penny:
Yeah. Mr. Vasquez, that producer, had some kind of hold on Hammer. She had some dirt on him... He'd do anything she said, apparently.
Maya:
Some "dirt"? What dirt!
Penny:
... Dirt. You know, bad stuff.
Maya:
... Um, I know what dirt means...
Penny:
About five years ago, they were filming a movie starring Mr. Hammer. They were using the new studio... Studio Two. Some sort of accident happened during filming. After that, they never used Studio Two again. They left the film set the way it was, too.
Phoenix:
(The film set...? Was that trailer part of the film set, then?)




The last episode







Maya:
W-what do you mean, the "last Steel Samurai"!?
Penny:
I know it's a shock, but nothing can be done to save it now. Whoever really did kill Mr. Hammer, also signed the Steel Samurai's death warrant.
Maya:
No... no!
Penny:
Also, I hear that Global Studios is going to change its programming. They're not going to make kids' shows anymore.
Maya:
W-what!? Why!?
Penny:
I don't know. It's sad, but that's what Global Studios decided.




Studio policy (appears after "The last episode")







Phoenix:
Why aren't they going to make kids' shows anymore?
Penny:
The studio bigwigs don't want the Steel Samurai around anymore. They want to forget all this ever happened. They want it quiet, you understand?
Maya:
H-how can they just do that! What about all the kids who love the Steel Samurai!
Penny:
It's okay. I'm sure the kids will be fine. They'll find a new hero to follow.
Maya:
No, that can't be true! If the program just ends, they'll be heartbroken for sure! N-Nick! Say something!
Phoenix:
Umm... yeah. (I think evidence, rather than words, is called for here.) Here, take a look at this.

This is why you can't stop the Steel Samurai.

Maya:

Phoenix:
F-funny that. I don't either! (Oops. Let's try that again.)
Leads back to:
"I think evidence, rather than words, is called for here."


Penny:
And this is...?
Phoenix:
A fan collected all of these photographs. The kids love the Steel Samurai! The show shouldn't be cancelled just so some adults can save face! I would think you would understand that better than anyone.
Penny:
... ... You're right... Okay! But what can I do?
Phoenix:
Well, for starters... You can tell me something. Tell me what it is that Global Studios is so intent on hiding? Tell me about this accident five years ago.
Penny:
... Okay!




Five years ago (appears after "Mr. Hammer", before clearing "Studio policy" Talk option)







Phoenix:
An accident five years ago?
Penny:
Yes, in Studio Two. That trailer there was part of the film set.
Phoenix:
Could you tell us what happened?
Penny:
... S-sorry. I don't think I can. They really don't want us to talk about it.




Five years ago (after clearing "Studio policy" Talk option)







Phoenix:
Could you tell us what happened five years ago?
Penny:
Well, I can tell you what I've heard. Apparently, five years ago, someone died... and it was Hammer's fault.
Maya:
S-someone died!?
Penny:
It was an accident, of course! Anyway... The producer, Ms. Vasquez managed to hush it up.
Phoenix:
And that's the "dirt" she had on Mr. Hammer?
Maya:
And that's why Mr. Hammer would do anything Ms. Vasquez asked him to do! ... But, it was an accident, right? Why didn't they just make it public?
Penny:
Well, you know Mr. Hammer was a big star back then. They were afraid about what would happen to his career if word got out.
Maya:
I see...
Penny:
You know who knows more about this? Ms. Oldbag. She was here at the studios back then, you know.
Phoenix:
Thanks. We'll try asking her. (If she'll talk...)Present

So this photo was Mr. Hammer all along?
Phoenix:
It seems that way.
Penny:
Why would Mr. Hammer do something like that?

Maya:
Nichols, Nick. Penny Nichols. That assistant we talked to.
Phoenix:
O-oh, right. Anyway, we heard about the accident. It was during filming with Jack Hammer... He killed a man. Didn't he?
Oldbag:
Wh-whippersnappers! Dredging up dirt on someone's past like that... and the recently departed, no less! I suppose you think this is fun!?
Phoenix:
N-no, I'm just doing my job to protect Mr. Powers...
Oldbag:
And you claim that Hammer stole Powers's costume! You expect me to believe that rubbish!? Or do you have some kind of proof?
Phoenix:
(Proof that Hammer stole Powers's costume? Hmm...)



I have proof







Phoenix:
I'm sorry Ms. Oldbag, but I do have proof. I can prove that Mr. Hammer stole Mr. Powers's costume.



Present Steak Plate







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Mr. Powers ate a t-bone steak for lunch, correct?
Oldbag:
W-well... yes. So?
Phoenix:
This is the plate that he used to eat that steak. There are traces of sleeping pill powder on the plate!

Well, that's what it was, wasn't it! I mean, sure, it was an accident... But you used it to drag Mr. Hammer down from his rightful place as a star!Vasquez:

Part 6October 20, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge:
Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix:
The defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge:
Today will be the final day of this trial. I hope both the prosecution and the defense will be able to present decisive evidence. Very well, Mr. Edgeworth. Your opening statement.Edgeworth:
In yesterday's session, the defense presented us with a new theory for this case. He claims that the scene of the crime was, in fact, Studio Two. Today, I will call on people present in the Studio Two trailer that day. From their testimonies, the truth will become clear.Judge:
Hmm... very well!Phoenix:
(Edgeworth seems a bit on edge today...)Judge:
You may call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth.Edgeworth:
The prosecution calls Ms. Dee Vasquez to the stand. Ms. Dee Vasquez is a producer who was present in the Studio Two trailer that day.Edgeworth:
Will the witness state her name and occupation?Vasquez:
... Dee Vasquez. I am a producer for Global Studios.Edgeworth:
On the day of the murder, you were in the trailer in Studio Two...Vasquez:
As everyone here knows, yes?Edgeworth:
...?Vasquez:
I dislike needless banter. If you must pontificate, do it when I'm not here.Edgeworth:
Mrrph!Judge:
V-very well, Ms. Vasquez. Please give the court your testimony concerning the day of the murder.Maya:
Nick! I know she did it! Make her pay!Phoenix:
R-right! (If she's guilty, I'll catch her with her pants down... So to speak.)Witness Testimony-- The Day of the Murder --Vasquez:
I entered the trailer, oh, a little before noon.
The meeting began at 12:00 sharp. It ended at 4:00.
There was to be a rehearsal afterwards, so we went to Studio One...
I was fatigued, so I had Sal take me.
At 2:30, we took a 15-minute break in the meeting.
Sal and I ate t-bone steaks on the table in front of the trailer.
We found Hammer's body later, when we all went to Studio One.
That's all.Judge:
Hmm... I have a question about one part of your testimony. You were "fatigued" so you had Sal "take" you...?Vasquez:
The van.Judge:
Hmm?Vasquez:
There's a van at Studio Two. I had him take me in that. I thought it might be risky to walk, what with that monkey's head toppling over.Van added to the Court Record.Judge:
I... I see! Very well. Mr. Wright, your cross-examination.Maya:

Edgeworth:
The witness did not come here to engage in idle conversation! Stop interrupting the testimony.
Vasquez:
The same could be said to you, Mr. Edgeworth. And please stop banging on your little desk. It hurts my ears.

And when exactly was that?
Vasquez:

Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Maybe you could try remembering?
Vasquez:
No.
Edgeworth:
The meeting ended at 4:00, and the rehearsal was scheduled for 5:00... I would think it was between those times.

Well, Nick? Find anything?Phoenix:
I kind of wish she'd said a little more...Maya:
It's hard. I think she's pretty used to being the boss. But I'm sure you'll find some contradiction in what she said... somewhere!Phoenix:
Hah! As I thought!Vasquez:
...Phoenix:
You claim you ate a t-bone steak! But I say you did not!Judge:
W-what's this, now, Mr. Wright?Phoenix:
Look at this.Judge:
It's... a plate?Phoenix:
This plate was on the table in the employee room. As you can see, a large bone has been left behind.Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright. Need I remind you it was a T-BONE steak!? ([steak] is all-caps in the original release)Phoenix:
Exactly my point! Remember if you will... Ms. Vasquez and Mr. Manella ate at a table outside the trailer. Yet there were no bones left on the plates! The plates were bare!Vasquez:
!Phoenix:
Ms. Vasquez? Tell me, how can a person eat a t-bone steak... and not leave the bone? I think I know how!You ate the bone, too







Phoenix:
You ate the bone, too!
Maya:
Um, Nick... are you sure? I mean, I love steak, but even I don't eat the bone!
Phoenix:
Hey, I don't eat it either!
Judge:
Mr. Wright! I, too, leave the bone.
Phoenix:
Um, can I try that again?
Leads back to:
"I think I know how!"You ate a boneless steak







Phoenix:
Elementary! You were eating a boneless steak!
Judge:
... Mr. Wright, say you are right... What would that prove?
Phoenix:
... Um, right, Your Honor.
Maya:
Nick! Remember her testimony? She said she ate a "t-bone steak"! She said "bone"!
Phoenix:
Correct! I was... testing you!
Maya:
Yeah, sure, Nick.
Phoenix:
Sorry... Can I try that one more time?
Judge:

Leads back to:
"I think I know how!"You didn't eat the steak







Leads to:
"You didn't eat any steak during that break!"Phoenix:
You didn't eat any steak during that break! You took your steak and threw it somewhere... like that incinerator!Vasquez:

I... I see! Then what was Ms. Vasquez doing during her break?Phoenix:
Isn't it obvious, Your Honor?Meeting the Steel Samurai







Leads to:
"She was meeting with the Steel Samurai!"Picking on Sal Manella







Phoenix:
She was picking on Mr. Manella!
Judge:
Mr. Wright... Sometimes this court finds it hard to tell whether you are joking or being serious.
Phoenix:
Oh...?
Judge:
I would prefer it if you remained serious!
Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor. I'll do my best.
Leads to:
"She was meeting with the Steel Samurai!"Phoenix:
She was meeting with the Steel Samurai!Judge:
Order! A-are you saying...!?Phoenix:
Yes, Your Honor! As Ms. Vasquez left the trailer to eat her steak... She ran into the Steel Samurai! And then you did it. You killed him with your own hands!Vasquez:
!!!Judge:
M-Mr. Wright! I-isn't that a little presumptuous!?Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
What kind of stunt are you trying to pull, Wright!?Vasquez:
Let him claim what he wants.... You say I did it?Phoenix:
Yes.Vasquez:
Fascinating! And here I was worrying that today would be as boring as all the rest. ... Very well. Let us have a battle of wits, you and I.Phoenix:
(Any day, Vasquez!)Maya:
Good luck, Nick!Vasquez:
Let's see... What was that murder weapon again? Oh yes, the "Samurai Spear."Phoenix:
Yes...?Vasquez:
I am, as you can see, a woman of petite stature. How could I possibly use that heavy spear as a weapon?I think you could!







Phoenix:
It's not impossible!
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
Well, maybe it's not impossible, but--
Vasquez:
Silence. I'm speaking.
Edgeworth:
Mmmph!
Vasquez:
The victim was stabbed through the chest from the front, yes? I believe this would indicate that the victim was aware of the killer's presence. Now, the Steel Samurai costume is quite light and mobile. Compared to the victim, I am weaker and slower... I couldn't possibly win such a fight! Not to mention, there is proof I did not have the spear! The photograph of the Steel Samurai shows that the victim himself was holding it! Or do you mean to suggest that I could have wrested it away from him?
Edgeworth:
Y-yeah! Take that, Wright! If you still think she did it, show us proof!
Phoenix:
Umm... er...
Maya:
Hey, Nick. Look at the data we have on that Samurai Spear in the Court Record. Isn't there something in there that gets to you...?
Phoenix:
Something odd about the Samurai Spear...? ... Wait!
Judge:
Something the matter, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
S-sorry, Your Honor. I'd like to take back my previous claim.
Judge:
Very well, I won't hold you to your claim. But I'm afraid I will have to penalize you.
Phoenix:
(Ugh...)
Edgeworth:
What's this? You're taking back your claim?
Phoenix:
Let's backtrack for a moment. I want to consider whether the witness could have used the Samurai Spear or not!
Leads to:
"However, that has no bearing on this case!"You couldn't, could you







Phoenix:
I think you would have a great deal of difficulty using that as a weapon. Pretty much anyone would.
Vasquez:
Hah. You see?
Phoenix:
Yes...
Leads to:
"However, that has no bearing on this case!"I don't know







Phoenix:
I don't know.
Edgeworth:

Edgeworth:
You "don't know"!? What kind of a lawyer are you!?
Vasquez:
Quiet. I'm speaking.
Edgeworth:
M-m-mmph!
Vasquez:
You "don't know"!? What kind of a lawyer...
Phoenix:
I don't know whether you could have fought with the Samurai Spear...
Leads to:
"However, that has no bearing on this case!"Phoenix:
However, that has no bearing on this case!Vasquez:
... Meaning?Phoenix:
The Samurai Spear was not the murder weapon!Vasquez:
What!?Judge:
What is the meaning of this!? The spear was found lying next to the victim's body!Phoenix:
I have proof, Your Honor. I can prove that the Samurai Spear was not used as the murder weapon!Present Samurai Spear







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"I present my proof: the so-called "murder weapon"!"Present anything else







Phoenix:

Judge:
Wrong, Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
But I haven't said anything yet...?
Judge:
I know you well enough by now to know when you're going to present the wrong evidence.
Maya:
I can sense it too, with my Fey blood...
Phoenix:
(Okay, okay, so I picked the wrong evidence! Enough with all the sensing!) Right. Okay, here's the real evidence, Your Honor.
Leads back to:
"I can prove that the Samurai Spear was not used as the murder weapon!"Phoenix:
I present my proof: the so-called "murder weapon"!Edgeworth:
B-but, that IS the murder weapon!Phoenix:
Not so fast. Remember that this spear broke during the morning action scene run-through? But, someone fixed the spear. It was the security lady! She fixed it with duct tape! Now tell me, how is it possible... for someone to stab a man who is wearing a thick costume with this!? Through the chest!Judge:
O-order! Order!Edgeworth:
Mr. Wright! What are you driving at!? Think about what you're--Vasquez:
Silence! I'm the one testifying here and I will be heard!Edgeworth:
Mmmph...!Vasquez:
Are you quite sane? Are you even aware of what you're saying? If the Samurai Spear was not the murder weapon, then pray tell what was!? How was Hammer killed?Judge:
Well, Mr. Wright? Can you tell us what weapon was used to kill Mr. Hammer?I can tell you







Leads to:
"Would I make a claim like that if I couldn't tell you what the weapon was?"I can't tell you







Phoenix:
Of course I can't.
Judge:
"O-of course"!?
Edgeworth:
Can the antics, Wright!
Judge:
I have to agree, Mr. Wright. At least pretend that you think you might know!

Would I make a claim like that if I couldn't tell you what the weapon was?Judge:
I'm afraid your confidence can sometimes be unfounded, Mr. Wright... Very well, let's see this murder weapon, then.Present Five-Year-Old Photo







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Look at this photo."Present anything else







Phoenix:

Maya:
Nick! Think about this some more!
Phoenix:
Huh? Think?
Maya:
Please! How could that possibly have been the murder weapon!?
Phoenix:
(Hmm. She has a point.)
Judge:
Something the matter?
Phoenix:
N-no, Your Honor. Nothing!
Leads back to:
"Very well, let's see this murder weapon, then."Phoenix:
Look at this photo.Judge:
W-what is this? Why, that's Jack Hammer standing at the top of the stairs! O-order! Order! If I cannot have order this trial will be suspended! Mr. Wright! What is this all about!?Phoenix:
This photograph is from five years ago. There was an unfortunate accident at Global Studios. This is a photo of that very accident. Not a word of this was leaked to the outside. It was a close-kept secret at the studios.Edgeworth:
What does this have to do with the current case!?Phoenix:
Mr. Edgeworth... You still can't see it? See the fallen man in this photo? See how the fencepost pierced him through the chest?Edgeworth:
Wh... what!? Are you saying...!?Phoenix:
Yes. What happened five years ago... has happened again!Vasquez:
!!!Judge:
Mr. Wright! Continue!Phoenix:
It's 2:30 PM on the day of the murder! Ms. Dee Vasquez meets Jack Hammer outside the Studio Two trailer! Then she did it! She pushed Mr. Hammer off the stairs onto the fence! Just like Mr. Hammer had himself done five years ago! Though whether she did it on purpose or by accident, I cannot say.Vasquez:
...!Edgeworth:
I-in other words... th-the victim, Mr. Hammer... He died in the same way that he caused another man to die... five years ago!Phoenix:
Precisely. Ironic, isn't it?Vasquez:
... Hoh hoh. Very creative, Mr. Wright. I could use a man like you on my script writing staff.Phoenix:
You deny that what I say is true?Vasquez:
... Mr. Wright. Let's say, for the sake of argument, that Hammer died at the trailer as you say. Yet the body was found at Studio One, was it not? And in the Evil Magistrate's costume, no less. Are you then claiming that I carried the body to Studio One... And returned to the trailer all in the space of a 15 minute break? How could I have disposed of the body!?Phoenix:
...Edgeworth:
The break in the meeting at the trailer lasted 15 minutes, from 2:30 to 2:45. Could Jack Hammer have been pushed off the stairs to his death... then carried to Studio One and placed inside his costume? There wasn't enough time!Judge:
Hmm... indeed. Well, Mr. Wright? How could she have dealt with the body?She couldn't deal with it







Phoenix:
15 minutes is kind of a short amount of time...
Vasquez:
You see? Even I cannot do the impossible. Therefore, Mr. Wright. I didn't do it. Agreed?
Phoenix:
Not agreed!
Vasquez:
?
Leads to:
"What if she had another way to carry the body, other than with her own hands?"I bet she could move it







Phoenix:
You'd be surprised! I bet she could do it! When people think their life depends on it, they can do amazing things!
Judge:
Mr. Wright, this is not an episode of "That's Incredible."
Edgeworth:
If you claim she did everything in 15 minutes...
Phoenix:
(Let me guess: "Show Me Proof!")
Edgeworth:
Correct! Show me proof!
Phoenix:
(How am I supposed to do that...?)
Edgeworth:
Then I won't have you making any unsubstantiated claims!
Phoenix:
(... Wait a second, how does he know what I'm thinking!?)
Edgeworth:
Hah! I need only look at the cold sweat running down your face to know what you're thinking!
Judge:
Mr. Wright. Perhaps you'd like to reconsider your claim?
Leads back to:
"Well, Mr. Wright? How could she have dealt with the body?"She had another way







Leads to:
"What if she had another way to carry the body, other than with her own hands?"Phoenix:
What if she had another way to carry the body, other than with her own hands?Vasquez:
For instance?Phoenix:
Actually, for that matter, there was no need for her to do the deed in 15 minutes! And there was a way for you to carry that body.Vasquez:
!!! I-interesting! Let's hear it then.Judge:
Mr. Wright? Please show us how she carried the body.Present Van







Phoenix:

Leads to:
"Ms. Vasquez."Present anything else







Phoenix:

Phoenix:
Dee Vasquez used this to carry the body to Studio One!
Vasquez:
...
Judge:
Mr. Wright...
Phoenix:
Your Honor?
Judge:
Mr. Wright, how can you carry a dead body with that?
Phoenix:
Umm...
Judge:
Please rethink your statement.
Leads back to:
"Please show us how she carried the body."Phoenix:
Ms. Vasquez. You carried the body to Studio One. And you used the studio van to do it!Vasquez:
!!!Phoenix:
Recall your testimony...Vasquez:
There was to be a rehearsal afterwards, so we went to Studio One. I was fatigued, so I had Sal take me. There was a van there, right? I had Sal drive me.Phoenix:
You used the van to carry the body to Studio One! Then, before everyone else got there, you put the body into the Magistrate costume!Vasquez:
...!Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
Hold on, Wright! Don't forget, it was Sal Manella that drove the van! Are you suggesting that Mr. Manella was a conspirator?Of course he was







Leads to:
"Of course, Sal Manella has to have been a conspirator!"Of course he wasn't







Phoenix:
Of course he wasn't!
Edgeworth:
Hah! So, without Mr. Manella noticing anything, she put the body in the van... Then managed to put the body into the costume...? Are you seriously suggesting that is possible!?
Phoenix:
... Of course I'm not serious.
Edgeworth:
Ha... hah!?
Phoenix:
I was kidding. To, er, lighten up the proceedings.
Edgeworth:
Li..light... Lighten!? Y-you can't lighten up a murder!
Judge:
Mr. Wright. The court requests you refrain from making claims in jest.
Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor.
Leads to:
"Of course, Sal Manella has to have been a conspirator!"Phoenix:
Of course, Sal Manella has to have been a conspirator! The body had to be placed in the van, and put into the costume. There's no way Ms. Vasquez could have done that alone! Also, don't forget that they had to dispose of the Steel Samurai costume. They had to... because it was covered in Mr. Hammer's blood! They probably burned it in that small incinerator. Well, Ms. Vasquez! Shall I continue?Vasquez:
... No need. You're smarter than you look, Mr. Wright. Hmph. I lose. You win. It... was fun.Phoenix:
(I... win!?) ...Edgeworth:
...Judge:
......Phoenix:
Umm... So... what happens next?Vasquez:
?Phoenix:
Don't "?" me! Don't you have anything to say!?Vasquez:
What would you like me to say?Phoenix:
Huh? "I lost"? Something like that!Vasquez:
I just said that.Phoenix:
W-wait, so you mean... Dee Vasquez! So, it was you? You killed Jack Hammer! ...Edgeworth:
...Judge:
......Vasquez:
Who can say?Phoenix:
Huh?Vasquez:
Are you sure I did? Mr. Wright... We just engaged in a battle of wits. And the result of that battle? You proved the possibility that I murdered Hammer.Phoenix:
R-right!Vasquez:
But... that is only a possibility. Proof is another thing altogether. You lack decisive proof, Mr. Wright.Phoenix:
Wha... wha... wha... wha... WHAAAAAAAAAT!?Judge:
Order! Mr. Edgeworth, your thoughts?Edgeworth:
Umm... uhh... mmmph. O-of course, it's as the witness says! ... Certainly, it does seem very likely she did it... but, uh, there's no proof!Phoenix:
(...! Edgeworth isn't sure!)Vasquez:
... Well? I came here as a witness today. If you've no more questions, I'll be leaving.Phoenix:
(Urk! What do I do now!?)You did it, Vasquez!







Phoenix:
Ms. Vasquez! You did it!
Vasquez:
... That wasn't a question.
Phoenix:
... Um, did you do it?
Vasquez:
No.
Judge:
Mr. Wright.
Phoenix:
Y-yes, Your Honor?
Judge:
I'm not sure that question helped this court get any closer to a verdict.
Leads back to:
"Urk! What do I do now!?"Testify again, Vasquez!







Phoenix:
I... I'd like you to testify again!
Judge:
Testify... again?
Vasquez:
Know when to give up, Mr. Wright. Think about it. Even if I were to testify again, what's the point? I can only say what I said before. The truth, Mr. Wright. I've already said all there is to say. What would happen if I said it again?
Phoenix:
Uh...
Vasquez:
You'd ask the same questions, get the same answers. A waste of time.
Leads to:
"Damn... damn!"No further questions, Vasquez!







Phoenix:
...
Judge:
Yes, Mr. Wright?
Phoenix:
I was hoping I'd come up with a question while pounding on my desk. I didn't.
Judge:
... You have my sympathies.
Leads to:
"Damn... damn!"Phoenix:
(Damn... damn! To come so far, only to fail...)Judge:
As it seems there are no further questions... I would like to end the cross-examination of the witness, Ms. Vasquez.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
...Judge:
Yes, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth:
I was hoping I'd come up with a question while I was objecting, Your Honor... I didn't.Judge:
I see... Very well.Edgeworth:Edgeworth:
Your Honor! I request that the witness testify again!Vasquez:
You are the prosecutor, are you not? Why are you badgering me? I'm your witness!Edgeworth:
I... I just want to hear your testimony again.Vasquez:
Does this make any sense to you, Your Honor? I don't see that we have anything to gain by repeating the last several minutes.Judge:
Mr. Edgeworth... I, too, see little point in making Ms. Vasquez repeat herself. What exactly did you want her to testify about?Edgeworth:
Mmmph! Well, yes, um... ... Indeed! Verily, I say... Ergo! I want to hear about what happened... after they found the body!Judge:
After they found the body...? Very well. The witness will testify to the court concerning this matter.Vasquez:
Hmph.Maya:
Nick! Why did Edgeworth...?Phoenix:
Who knows? He probably realized she did it, too.Maya:
But... but! Wasn't he the one that said he always gets a guilty verdict...? After all that...Phoenix:
(Edgeworth...)Witness Testimony-- After Finding the Body --Vasquez:
I was with Sal and Oldbag, the security lady, when we found the body.
The assistant was there, too. Only Powers was absent.
I immediately called the police. Then Powers showed up.
The security lady, Oldbag, was quite agitated. Pointing at Powers, saying "he did it!"
I asked to be left out of the proceedings.
I went back to the trailer to get my script and direction notes.
Then I went home.Judge:
Hmm... I see no issues raised by this testimony... Mr. Wright, your cross-examination.Maya:
Okay, Nick, we're close, real close! She may be acting tough now... But if you put her on the spot she's sure to falter! Find the key you need and twist the truth out of her, Nick!Phoenix:
Right!Cross Examination

2024-11-29 17:20:18 [INFO] HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
2024-11-29 17:20:18 [INFO] Assistant reply: To identify the contradiction in the witness's testimony, we need to consider the context and evidence carefully:

**Testimony Analysis:**
1. Sal Manella and Oldbag were with Vasquez when they found the body.
2. The assistant was present, but Powers was absent.
3. Vasquez claims she immediately called the police, followed by Powers showing up.
4. Oldbag was agitated, accusing Powers of being the culprit.
5. Vasquez asked to be left out of the proceedings.
6. She went back to the trailer to get her script and notes.
7. Vasquez then went home.

**Key Evidence:**
1. **Guidemap (Evidence #2):** A map of Global Studios which doesn't directly counter the testimonial flow.
2. **Jack's Autopsy Report (Evidence #3):** Indicative of the time of death, but not immediately relevant to her movements post the discovery of the body.
3. **Photo and Camera Evidence:** Showing critical timelines, but again not strikingly contradicting her actions after finding the body.
4. **Existing Characters in Context:**
   - Sal Manella (director) was busy during this time, having interactions monitored.
   - Oldbag (security) had specific accusations possibly contradicting Vasquez's calm claim timeline.
   
Considering the sequence and her strategic omissions or twisted recollections, focusing on **point 4**, regarding who pointed fingers, and **point 6 or 7** with Studio Two activities could leverage discrepancies around the crime scene management or police engagement.

**Conclusion:**
The most striking area involves the notion of "being left out of the proceedings," directing toward her supposed removal and yet involvement – a conscious detailing that merits exploring any contradictory evidence, possibly revisited in conjunction with something like her actual involvements in the immediate post-incident atmosphere.

**Action JSON:**
```json
{
  "action": "present",
  "testimony": 4,
  "evidence": 3
}
```

This action assumes exploring contradictions in how accusations fell upon Powers, the flow of police engagement, and potential involvement reflections mismatching her testimony. **Final Answer:**
```json
{
  "action": "present",
  "testimony": 3,
  "evidence": 3
}
``` 

This seems to probe further around indexing inconsistencies in Vasquez's description of the post-crime operations, connecting discrepancies in recalling critical evidential involvement and retrieving script materials amid murder-related trajectories.

2024-11-29 17:20:24 [INFO] Assistant reply: Apologies for any oversight. Let's review the scenario and prepare a more streamlined and correctly formatted response:

**Testimony Analysis:**
1. Vasquez mentions being with Sal Manella and Oldbag when finding the body.
2. She notes the assistant was present, but Powers was absent.
3. Vasquez claims she called the police immediately, and then Powers showed up.
4. Oldbag was agitated, blaming Powers.
5. Vasquez wanted to be excluded from the proceedings.
6. She returned to the trailer for her script and notes.
7. She went home afterward.

**Approach to Contradiction:**
- **Focus:** Discrepancy around who dealt with the police and any unaligned mentions of post-incident actions.
- **Evidence:** The contradiction could revolve around other evidence related to timelines, like interactions involving Sal Manella, or the autopsy/timeline.

Given the testimony provided, let's ensure the final JSON adheres correctly:

**Final JSON Response:**
```json
{
  "action": "present",
  "testimony": 2,
  "evidence": 3
}
```

This JSON specifies checking the timeline regarding Vasquez's claims about calling the police and how that correctly aligns with other known evidence from the crime's timeline or autopsy data. Let me know if further adjustments are needed!

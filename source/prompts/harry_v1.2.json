    "suffix" : "Which evidence/character and testimony contradict each other? You must make two choices: one for an evidence or a character, and one for a testimony. You must only answer one pair. You may output an explaination, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3} or {\"character\": 4, \"testimony\": 11}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else."

Well, I have to say Phoenix, I'm impressed! Not everyone takes on a murder trial right off the bat like this. It says a lot about you... and your client as well.Phoenix:\nUm... thanks. Actually, it's because I owe him a favor.Mia:\nA favor? You mean, you knew the defendant before this case?Phoenix:\nYes. Actually, I kind of owe my current job to him. He's one of the reasons I became an attorney.Mia:\nWell, that's news to me!Phoenix:\nI want to help him out any way I can! I just... really want to help him. I owe him that much.???:\n(It's over! My life, everything, it's all over!)Mia:\n... Is that your client screaming over there?

Tell them I'm guilty!!! Gimme the death sentence! I ain't afraid to die!Phoenix:\nWhat!? What's wrong, Larry?Butz:\nOh, it's all over... I... I'm finished. Finished! I can't live in a world without her! I can't! Who... who took her away from me, Nick? Who did this!? Aww, Nick, ya gotta tell me! Who took my baby away!?Phoenix:\n(Hmm... The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say it was you...)Phoenix:\nMy name is Phoenix Wright. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: Larry Butz... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\" In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!August 3, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge:\nCourt is now in session for the trial of Mr. Larry Butz.

Tell me, what's the victim's name?Phoenix:\n(Whew, I know this one! Glad I read the case report cover to cover so many times. It's... wait... Uh-oh! No... no way! I forgot! I'm drawing a total blank here!)Mia:\nPhoenix! Are you absolutely SURE you're up to this? You don't even know the victim's name!?Phoenix:\nOh, the victim! O-Of course I know the victim's name! I, um, just forgot. ...Temporarily (Changed from [I, um, just forgot. ... Temporarily.] in the original release)Mia:\nI think I feel a migraine coming on.

I suppose there's nothing to do but give you another try:\nLeads back to:\n\"She died because she was...?\"Phoenix:\nShe was struck once, by a blunt object.Judge:\nCorrect. You've answered all my questions. I see no reason why we shouldn't proceed. You seem much more relaxed, Mr. Wright. Good for you.Phoenix:\nThank you, Your Honor. (Because I don't FEEL relaxed, that's for sure.)Judge:\nWell, then... First, a question for the prosecution. Mr. Payne?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor?Judge:\nAs Mr. Wright just told us, the victim was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to the court just what that \"object\" was?Payne:\nThe murder weapon was this statue of \"The Thinker.\" It was found lying on the floor, next to the victim.Judge:\nI see... The court accepts it into evidence. (Changed from [I see... the court accepts it into evidence.] in the original release)Statue added to the Court Record.Mia:\nWright... Be sure to pay attention to any evidence added during the trial. That evidence is the only ammunition you have in court. [Touch the Court Record button / Use the R Button] to check the Court Record frequently.Judge:\nMr. Payne, the prosecution may call its first witness.Payne:\nThe prosecution calls the defendant, Mr. Butz, to the stand.Phoenix:\nUm, Chief, what do I do now?Mia:\nPay attention. You don't want to miss any information that might help your client's case. You'll get your chance to respond to the prosecution later, so be ready! Let's just hope he doesn't say anything... unfortunate.Phoenix:\n(Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... This could be bad.) (Changed from [Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... this could be bad.] in the original release)Payne:\nAhem. Mr. Butz. Is it not true that the victim had recently dumped you?Butz:\nHey, watch it buddy! We were great together!

WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?Payne:\nMr. Butz, what you describe is generally what we mean by \"dumped.\" In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!Butz:\nWhaddya mean, \"one of them\"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!Payne:\nYour Honor, the victim's passport. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.Passport added to the Court Record.Judge:\nHmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.Butz:\nDude... no way...Payne:\nThe victim was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several \"Sugar Daddies.\"Butz:\nDaddies? Sugar?Payne:\nYes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.Butz:\nDuuude!Payne:\nWe can clearly see what kind of woman this Ms. Stone was. Tell me, Mr. Butz, what do you think of her now?Mia:\nWright... I don't think you want him to answer that question.Phoenix:\n(Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)Wait and see what happens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(Might be better not to get involved in this one...)\nPayne:\nWell, Mr. Butz?\nButz:\nDude, no way!

That question is irrelevant to this case!\nPayne:\nOof! *wince*\nButz:\nDude! Nick! Whaddya mean, \"irrelevant\"!? That cheatin' she-dog!\nLeads to:\n\"I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead!\"Butz:\nI'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I'm going to get to the bottom of this!Judge:\nLet's continue with the trial, shall we?Payne:\nI believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.Judge:\nYes, quite.Phoenix:\n(Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)Payne:\nNext question! You went to the victim's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?Butz:\nGulp!Payne:\nWell, did you, or did you not?Butz:\nHeh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn't!Phoenix:\n(Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)Have him answer honestly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I know! I'll send him a signal...)\n\n(TELL THE TRUTH)\n\nButz:\nEr... Yeah! Yeah! I was there! I went!\nJudge:\nOrder! Well, Mr. Butz?\nButz:\nDude, chill! She wasn't home, man... So, like, I didn't see her.\nPayne:\n\nPayne:\nYour Honor, the defendant is lying.\nJudge:\nLying?\nPayne:\nThe prosecution would like to call a witness who can prove Mr. Butz is lying.\nLeads to:\n\"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?\"Stop him from answering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix:\n(I'll send him a signal...)\n\n(LIE LIKE A DOG)\n\nButz:\nUm, well, see, it's like this: I don't remember.\nPayne:\nYou \"don't remember\"? Well then, we'll just have to remind you!\nPhoenix:\n(I got a bad feeling about this...)\nPayne:\nWe have a witness that can prove he DID go to the victim's apartment that day!\nLeads to:\n\"Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?\"Judge:\nWell, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness?Payne:\nThe man who found the victim's body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw the defendant fleeing the scene of the crime!Judge:\nOrder! Order in the court! Mr. Payne, the prosecution may call its witness.Payne:\nYes, Your Honor.Phoenix:\n(This is bad...)Payne:\nOn the day of the murder, my witness was selling newspapers at the victim's building. Please bring Mr. Frank Sahwit to the stand!Payne:\nMr. Sahwit, you sell newspaper subscriptions, is this correct?Sahwit:\nOh, oh yes! Newspapers, yes!Judge:\nMr. Sahwit, you may proceed with your testimony. Please tell the court what you saw on the day of the murder.Witness Testimony-- Witness's Account --Sahwit:\nI was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.\nI thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.\nThinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.\nThen I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!\nI quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.\nI thought to call the police immediately!\nHowever, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.\nI went to a nearby park and found a public phone.\nI remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.\nThe man who ran was, without a doubt, the defendant sitting right over there.Judge:\nHmm...Phoenix:\n(Larry! Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!)Judge:\nIncidentally, why wasn't the phone in the victim's apartment working?Payne:\nYour Honor, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.Judge:\nAren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?Payne:\nYes, Your Honor... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that Mr. Sahwit used was one of those. Your Honor... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.Blackout Record added to the Court Record.Judge:\nNow, Mr. Wright...Phoenix:\nYes! Er... yes, Your Honor?Judge:\nYou may begin your cross-examination.Phoenix:\nC-Cross-examination, Your Honor?Mia:\nAlright, Wright, this is it. The real deal!Phoenix:\nUh... what exactly am I supposed to do?Mia:\nWhy, you expose the lies in the testimony the witness just gave!Phoenix:\nLies! What?! He was lying!?Mia:\nYour client is innocent, right? Then that witness must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?Phoenix:\n!!! How do I prove he's not?Mia:\nYou hold the key! It's in the evidence! Compare the witness's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there! First, find contradictions between the Court Record and the witness's testimony. Then, once you've found the contradicting evidence... present it and rub it in the witness's face!Phoenix:\nUm... okay.Mia:\nOpen the Court Record with [the R Button / Tab], then point out contradictions in the testimony!

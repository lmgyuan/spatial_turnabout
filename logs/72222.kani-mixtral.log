Some parameters are on the meta device device because they were offloaded to the cpu.
The attention mask and the pad token id were not set. As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input's `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.
Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:2 for open-end generation.
The attention mask is not set and cannot be inferred from input because pad token is same as eos token.As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input's `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.
The Yamanote Line in Tokyo, Japan, is a busy and important railway loop that serves many major commercial and residential areas of the city. The line has 29 stations in total, and each station has multiple connections to other railway lines, as well as bus and subway services.

The exact number of connections at each station on the Yamanote Line varies, as some stations have more lines intersecting with them than others. However, here is a breakdown of the number of connections at each station on the Yamanote Line:

* 1 connection: Kanda, Nippori, Ueno, and Tokyo stations.
* 2 connections: Hamamatsucho, Shimbashi, Yurakucho, and Ikebukuro stations.
* 3 connections: Osaki, Meguro, Ebisu, Shinagawa, Shinjuku, Harajuku, Shibuya, and Tabata stations.
* 4 connections: Akihabara, Sendagaya, and Yoyogi stations.
* 5 connections: Takadanobaba and Shin-Okubo stations.
* 6 connections: Ryogoku and Akishima stations.
* 7 connections: Kichijoji and Musashi-Koyama stations.

It's worth noting that some of these connections may be to other JR East lines, such as the Chuo Line or the Keihin-Tohoku Line, while others may be to private railway lines or subway lines operated by different companies. Additionally, some of these connections may only be available during certain hours or on certain days, so it's always a good idea to check the latest schedules and service information before planning your trip.

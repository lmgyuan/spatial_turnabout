In order to understand it myself... ...I had to know the story of these last seven long years. Nothing happens by chance... All is connected. And now... ..you stand ready to begin the final chapter of this story. Will the defendant be found guilty, or innocent? The decision is yours. October 7, 10:37 AMWright Anything Agency Examine evidence Attorney's Badge Back side Apollo: There's a number inscribed on the back of the badge. There are many numbers like it, but this one is mine. Proof that I'm an attorney. To tell the truth, I get a happy feeling inside just looking at it. Trucy: Hey, Apollo! Look, on TV! Look! Look! Apollo: Yeah... uh, I'm kinda busy. Trucy: Whoa! Look at that! He's the last Gramarye, alright! Amazing! Apollo: ...... Trucy: Apollo, you should be watching this! Apollo: Ow ow ow! What? What!? ...I was writing about our last case in my journal. Trucy: Lawyers are supposed to write things in \"records\", Apollo, not journals. And why now? That case was three months ago. Apollo: Hey, it's a long story. ...I did a lot, you know. I want to vacuum pack the feel of the moment for later. Right now I'm wowing the crowd by figuring out how Lamiroir disappeared. Trucy: That's right! Uncle Valant did that illusion, too! But you're missing him on TV right now! Apollo: *sigh*... I was just getting to the good part. (I suppose I should watch a little TV with her. After all, her father's expecting me to look after her while he's away...) Announcer: What you're now seeing is a rehearsal for the greatest magic show on Earth... ...happening right here at our very own Sunshine Coliseum! Apollo: The Sunshine Coliseum? Hey, that's where the Gavinners concert was! Announcer: ...Only three more days until miracles happen here, right before your unbelieving eyes! The legendary Troupe Gramarye is performing for the first time in seven years! Trucy: That's going to be great! I'm so there! You and Daddy are coming, too! Apollo: (The legendary Gramaryes... ...If Trucy's real father were still alive... ...he'd be on that stage performing miracles.) Trucy: I've got the tickets and everything! Here's yours, Apollo. Magic Show ticket received. Examine evidence Magic Show Ticket Back side Trucy: Are you ready, Apollo!? Apollo: Ready? For what? Trucy: For what!? For the Troupe Gramarye Grand Magic Show! Apollo: I-It's not like I'm getting up on stage or anything... Trucy: ...What are you talking about, Apollo!? You can't enjoy magic if you're not part of what's going on up on stage! I'll lend you my spare costume if you need one. Apollo: Huh? You mean, I can't go in this? Trucy: No. Apollo: (...Doesn't get more straightforward than that.) ...*squeak*... ???: Ah, you are here. Working hard or hardly working? Phoenix: Hey! How have you been? Trucy: Hi there, stranger! Apollo: (Not exactly the kind of greeting I'd want to hear from my own kid. Though he has been gone a long time.) Phoenix: Ah ha ha, how goes it, Trucy? Here, I got a present for you. Trucy: Yay! Pudding! I love pudding! Ooh, it's farm-fresh! And not just one pudding, but three whole cups! I'll have to pace myself. Phoenix: Well, I'm beat. Trucy: That's right, Daddy. You're on a top secret mission! You've got to take it easy with the secrets, you know. Phoenix: Ah ha ha. How right you are. Apollo: So, you still can't tell us what your \"mission\" is? Phoenix: ...... Maybe it is time. It has something to do with you, anyway. Apollo: Huh? With... me? Trucy: Ooh! Maybe you're getting a top secret mission, too! Maybe you can be one of those guys! A spy! Apollo: (Can't I just be a defense attorney...?) Phoenix: Ah ha ha! To be honest... ...telling you about the mission was my whole reason for coming here today. Apollo: What...? Phoenix: Tell me... ...you've heard of the Jurist System, yes? Trucy: The Jurist System...? Phoenix: That's right. The new legal system everyone's talking about. Trucy: Have you heard of it, Apollo? Apollo: Huh? Uh... Maybe? Phoenix: ...... Maybe not as many people are talking about it as I thought. Apollo: (The \"Jurist System\", huh?) Examine Bookshelf Phoenix: Ah, those legal books were left by my mentor. Too bad I gave up the practice before reading them. Apollo: There's quite a few magic books in there, too, you know. Phoenix: Ah ha ha. Those would be Trucy's. She'll remember they're there eventually, I'm sure. Apollo: (For a moment, I thought Mr. Wright might do magic, too... A scary thought.) Charley the plant Phoenix: ...The plant. It intrigues you, doesn't it? Apollo: Not really. It's just the only thing in here that doesn't have some secret function. Phoenix: Ah ha ha. No, no secrets. But lots of memories. And a name, too. Want to hear it? Apollo: Not really. Phoenix: His name... is Charley. If you were curious. Apollo: (Really, I wasn't.) Hula hoop Trucy: Want to have a go at that ring, Apollo? Apollo: No, no, I was just touching it. Trucy: C'mon, there's no need to be shy! Just slip it on... There! Apollo: Yoooooowwwwwwwwch! Trucy: You're way too tense! You gotta loosen up, there. Apollo: The human body wasn't meant to bend like that! Magic split box Apollo: I can't believe you're using this cutting-a-person-apart box as... shelf space. Trucy: You know, I used that trick on stage the other night. Imagine my surprise when I pulled one of my shirts out of the box! Apollo: ...You should really examine your props before the show. Photograph Apollo: That magician in the photo, is that your...? Trucy: My real Daddy, yup! Zak Gramarye! He disappeared when I was little. I hung that up there so I wouldn't forget what he looked like. Apollo: ...I see. (She's smiling, but I'll bet that smile doesn't go very deep...) Piano Apollo: (No one's practicing the piano, as usual. Even calling him a pianist is an insult to pianists everywhere.) Trucy: OK, Apollo! I'm going to guess what you're thinking right now! Apollo: Huh? What, was I making a funny face or something? Trucy: \"Argh! I'm so hungry!\"... I'm right, right? Of course I am. Apollo: There's no \"of course\" about it! You guessed wrong. ...Besides, that's not what I'm thinking... it's what you're thinking! Trucy: Ack! How did you do that!? You read my mind, Apollo! Apollo: At least you've got that pudding. Trucy: That's right! Apollo: ...Try not to eat my share, will you? Silk hat Apollo: That hat... Is that a spare? It looks exactly like the one you always wear. Trucy: That's the first rule of a professional: be prepared! You know, I put it on the other day... ...and this strange white substance fell all over me! It was like magic! Apollo: Or... like fingerprint powder. Spaghetti Apollo: A plate of plastic spaghetti for displaying in a shop. ...Where the heck does she get this stuff? Table Trucy: Ooh, careful there, Apollo. A lot of people run into that table, you know. Why, some client knocked the pot clean over the other day. Apollo: ...Um, why not get a more sturdy table? Trucy: Hmm. Maybe the table is partially to blame... Apollo: ...There's no \"maybe\" to this. That thing is a deathtrap. Move Phoenix: Ahem. I wasn't finished talking to you, you know. Or rather, you weren't finished asking me questions. Apollo: (Why try to fight it? I can't win...) Talk The Jurist System Trucy: So, Daddy, what's this \"Jurist System\" thing? Phoenix: Well, Trucy, do you know what a \"jury\" is? Trucy: I've heard of it. Isn't that those people who sit in court in those old courtroom dramas? The ones who get to decide if a guy's innocent or guilty? Do you know, Apollo? Apollo: ...Only from TV. It's twelve people, chosen from the community, right? Phoenix: Well, they're thinking about reviving that system. They're calling the new system, the \"Jurist System\". Trucy: \"No more doing whatever you like, Your Honor!\" Phoenix: Not quite that harsh. The jurists cooperate with the judge. They help analyze the case from different angles. Apollo: Ah, and there will be only six of them under the current proposal, right? Trucy: Wow, you know your stuff, Apollo! Phoenix: Their findings directly affect the verdict. Hopefully, people will start taking the courts a little more seriously now. Trucy: I feel like I'm on some kind of educational TV show! Starring Dr. Wright! Phoenix: Ah ha. Dr. Wright, his assistant Trucy... ...and mascot Apollo. The perfect team! Apollo: (Mascot...? Hey!) The secret mission Apollo: So... What is this secret mission? Phoenix: The Jurist System is my mission... more or less. Anyway, keep in mind that new ideas like this system are always risky, Apollo. Trucy: Too true... Everyone's got an opinion, and they just talk and talk and nothing gets decided. Kind of like you, Apollo. Apollo: Uh, I'm not that bad. Am I? Phoenix: In any case... ...we're going to give it a shot. A test, if you will. Trucy: I don't like tests. Phoenix: We'll take a case as a sample, and choose six jurists. I'll be the one helping with that process, incidentally. Apollo: Helping... how? Phoenix: Well, for one, I'll be chair of the Jurist System Simulated Court Committee. The chair constructs the ideal situation... choosing the case, the jurist candidates... ...even the judge and the courtroom. Trucy: Wow! It's like you have a real job! Phoenix: ...I was never that good at the piano, to be honest. Apollo: (Once a lawyer, always a lawyer, I guess.) Phoenix: The trial's tomorrow, by the way. Don't miss it. The trial simulation that is. Trucy: A simulation, huh... Sounds interesting. Valant Gramarye Trucy: Hey, Apollo, I know you're all excited about that secret mission... ...but what about this!? The \"Troupe Gramarye Grand Magic Show\"! Apollo: Huh? Oh, right. The card tricks. Trucy: They're not \"card tricks\"! They're grand illusions! Miracles! The apocalypse! Heaven and Earth will shake! Apollo: ...So what, that's three whole days from now. Trucy: It's at Sunshine Coliseum! Let's go! Let's go today! We can say hi to Uncle Valant! Apollo: Have fun. Trucy: Whaaaat!? I can't go by myself! You know I'm not very outgoing! Apollo: Riiight! Phoenix: Why not go with her? Apollo: But... what about the \"secret mission\"...? Phoenix: Oh, don't worry about that. You'll hear all about it tomorrow, regardless. Apollo: (I don't trust that smile. He knows something that he's not telling me.) Trucy: Yippee! Now you can take me to the coliseum! Apollo: (*sigh* I suppose it wouldn't kill me to pop over there.) Phoenix: Ah, \"Gramarye\", that reminds me... Trucy: ...What's this, Daddy? Isn't that silk hat the Gramarye seal? Phoenix: Consider it a birthday present, Trucy. Trucy: Thanks! It's great! But... ...today isn't my birthday. Phoenix: ...Hmm. Good point. ...What day is it today, Apollo? Apollo: Huh? Today? Um... I think it's \"Recycle Your Plastics\" day... Phoenix: Then, it's a Recycle-Your-Plastics present. Trucy: Yippee! So it's plastic! Apollo: (I've given up trying to understand them. It's much easier that way.) ...So what is it? Trucy: Can I open it, Daddy? Phoenix: ...No. Trucy: Huh!? Phoenix: You'll need that envelope someday. Someday soon. Don't open it until then. Trucy: ...... Well, why didn't you just hold on to it until then? Apollo: (...Because that would be the logical thing to do.) Gramarye Envelope obtained. Apollo: An envelope about the Gramaryes, huh? Hmm... Valant Gramarye (subsequent times) Trucy: Hey, Apollo, I know you're all excited about that secret mission... ...but what about this!? The \"Troupe Gramarye Grand Magic Show\"! Apollo: Huh? Oh, right. The card tricks. Trucy: They're not \"card tricks\"! They're grand illusions! Miracles! The apocalypse! Heaven and Earth will shake! Apollo: ...So what, that's three whole days from now. Trucy: It's at Sunshine Coliseum! Let's go! Let's go today! We can say hi to Uncle Valant! Apollo: Have fun. Trucy: Whaaaat!? I can't go by myself! You know I'm not very outgoing! Apollo: Riiight! Phoenix: Why not go with her? Apollo: But... what about the \"secret mission\"...? Phoenix: Oh, don't worry about that. You'll hear all about it tomorrow, regardless. Apollo: (I don't trust that smile. He knows something that he's not telling me.) Trucy: Yippee! Now you can take me to the coliseum! Apollo: (*sigh* I suppose it wouldn't kill me to pop over there.) Present Anything Phoenix: Ah, \"presenting\", are we? I did my fair share of that back in the day. Showed my attorney's badge a lot, too. Trucy: He may look cool and calm now, but you should have seen him before! Phoenix: Ah ha ha. You know me too well, Trucy. Apollo: (I'm glad I provided this opportunity for a little family bonding.) Examine evidence Gramarye Envelope Signature Apollo: Ah, lookey here. A handwritten signature. It says... I can't read it. Trucy: That seems odd to me. I mean, isn't a signature intended to show ownership? What's the use if no one can read it? Apollo: Isn't enough if you can read your own? <!- potential typo? --> Trucy: ...Oh! I never thought of it that way! After clearing \"The Jurist System\" and \"The secret mission\" Talk options: Apollo: So... what kind of case is the trial simulation about? Phoenix: Well, since it is the first run through of a new system, I wanted something simple. Trucy: Good thinking! No sense wearing yourself out on something too serious! Phoenix: True. The case is a murder. Apollo: That's not simple at all!! Trucy: By \"simple\", did you mean that the defendant is... Phoenix: ...Guilty. Yes. Most likely. ...So, good luck, Apollo. Apollo: Um... with what? Phoenix: With the trial tomorrow. You're defending, of course. Recall that I said it had something to do with you. Trucy: Go for it, Apollo! It's just a test case, anyway. No sweat! Apollo: Yeah, but there's still a verdict to be decided. Phoenix: ...And a potentially serious sentence. The most serious, in a worst-case scenario. Apollo: Ack! You mean... the verdict's for real!? That's not a \"test\" trial! That's a... real trial! Phoenix: All the forms have been filed. There's no turning back now. The trial begins tomorrow at 10 AM. Hope you can make room in your schedule. Apollo: Wh-Why am I only hearing about this now!? Phoenix: ...Ah, yes. There was a change this morning. ...I picked a new case. Apollo: Eh...? Phoenix: ...Something that happened last night. Talk The trial simulation Apollo: Alright, so what case are you going to use? Phoenix: You really want to know don't you? Apollo: Of course I do! I mean... I'm going to be defending, aren't I? Phoenix: If all goes well, then yes. Of course, this is just a test. We wanted everyone to start without preconceptions. A blank slate, as it were. Apollo: There's a difference between having a blank slate and just being totally clueless. Whose dumb idea was that anyway? (Changed from [Who's [sic] dumb idea was that anyway?] in the original release) Phoenix: Well mine. Committee chair, remember? Apollo: Oh... Phoenix: Well, if you want to know that badly, I suppose... ...I could give you permission to examine the scene of the crime. Apollo: Good! That's better. Phoenix: ...But you can't talk to anyone involved with the case. Apollo: What!? Then how am I supposed to defend...? Phoenix: You let me worry about the details, there. Remember... I'm in charge of this trial. All of it. Apollo: But you don't want it to backfire, do you? Phoenix: Apollo... ...if I am in charge of the whole trial... ...that means the entire affair is my responsibility. For good, or for bad. Apollo: ...! Phoenix: Just do what you can. And don't worry. I know what I'm doing. Apollo: A... Alright. Phoenix: I'd recommend going down to the detention center. Your client's waiting for you. You can ask about the scene there. Apollo: But you just said I couldn't talk to anyone involved... Phoenix: ...Oh, you can talk to your client. If... you can get her to talk. Trucy: Well, time's a wasting! The trial simulation (subsequent times) Apollo: Alright, so what case are you going to use? Phoenix: You really want to know don't you? Apollo: Of course I do! I mean... I'm going to be defending, aren't I? Phoenix: If all goes well, then yes. Of course, this is just a test. We wanted everyone to start without preconceptions. A blank slate, as it were. Apollo: There's a difference between having a blank slate and just being totally clueless. Whose dumb idea was that anyway? (Changed from [Who's [sic] dumb idea was that anyway?] in the original release) Phoenix: Well mine. Committee chair, remember? Apollo: Oh... Phoenix: Well, if you want to know that badly, I suppose... ...I could give you permission to examine the scene of the crime. Apollo: Good! That's better. Phoenix: ...But you can't talk to anyone involved with the case. Apollo: What!? Then how am I supposed to defend...? Phoenix: You let me worry about the details, there. Remember... I'm in charge of this trial. All of it. Apollo: But you don't want it to backfire, do you? Phoenix: Apollo... ...if I am in charge of the whole trial... ...that means the entire affair is my responsibility. For good, or for bad. Apollo: ...! Phoenix: Just do what you can. And don't worry. I know what I'm doing. Apollo: A... Alright. After clearing \"The trial simulation\" Talk option in Wright Anything Agency: October 7Detention CenterVisitor's Room Apollo: ...... Trucy: ...... Apollo: That's 20 minutes we've been waiting here! 20 minutes! Trucy: Maybe I should complain? I'm sure that guard has better things to do than stand there pretending he doesn't see us. Apollo: You know the minute we get angry, the client will show. It always works that way. Trucy: Like shouting, \"Oh, waiter!\" and they're standing right behind you? Oh, guaaaaard! Is our client going to be much longer? Guard: What are you talking about!? Haven't you already started the meeting, yet!? Trucy: ...Huh? Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeek! Apollo: Wh-Wh-Where'd you come from!? ???: ...... Apollo: W-W-W-Well... ...Anyway! Please have a seat! ???: ...... Trucy: ...... I'm nervous, Apollo. Apollo: It's the silence. It builds suspense. Why don't you do something, Trucy? You're a magician, aren't you? Trucy: Th-That's right. OK... Mr. Hat: I'm the Amazing Mr. Hat! ???: ...... ...*thud*... Trucy: Eeeeeeeeek! She passed out! Apollo: Hmm. Ms. Magic Underwear might have been a better bet. Trucy: That's \"Magic Panties\", Apollo! Examine Security camera Apollo: The security camera stares down from the ceiling, all-seeing, unblinking. Not that I'm nervous or anything. Security guard Apollo: The same old security guard is glaring at us. ...He winked. Maybe he's not such a bad guy after all. Talk Introductions Apollo: Um. Uh. Hi! Well, I'm your defense... ...I really think it has to be fate, you know! ???: ...... Apollo: And by fate, I mean destiny! Did you know I'm good with astrology? Tell me, what's your sign? ???: ...... Trucy: ...I can tell you mine, if you'd like, Apollo? Apollo: ...No, never mind. I just got carried away there. (I seem destined to get difficult clients, it seems.) Your name? Apollo: Um... So, what's your name? ???: ...... Apollo: Oh, right, I'm supposed to introduce myself first! I'm Apollo! Apollo Justice! ???: ...... Trucy: And I'm Trucy Wright. Apollo: ...I know. (This is getting nowhere fast.) The case Apollo: Hey, I know! Maybe you can tell us what happened? I'm your defense attorney, after all! ???: ...... Apollo: Um, anything out of the ordinary happen lately? ???: ...... Trucy: Well, the other day this tourist from out of town stopped to ask me directions. Apollo: ...Later, Trucy. (I feel like I need to ask directions myself here...) Present Anything Apollo: Um, see this here? ???: ...... Apollo: Um, does it ring any bells? ???: ...... Apollo: (Does anything I say ring anything?) After clearing all Talk options: Apollo: (Well, that was fruitless. Though I think I understand despair a little better now.) Trucy: You did good, Apollo! ???: ...... Trucy: L-Look! She's doing her nails! Apollo: What? Are nails more important than defense? Is that it!? ...Let's go, Trucy. ???: ...Excuse me... Apollo: ...! ???: C-Could you... Could you read this? Apollo: Um, sure. (I feel like a teenager on a first date! And this is the love letter we passed from desk to desk at school...) Trucy: Stop looking so wistful and read it, Apollo! Apollo: It... It's a business card. With a name and an address. The name is... Vera Misham? The address is for \"Drew Studio\". Vera's Card added to the Court Record. Examine evidence Vera's Card Back side Trucy: What a pretty business card. Looks like a postcard, almost. Apollo: And on the back... Hmm. Just her name. Trucy: That seems odd to me. Apollo: Huh? What does? Trucy: Why write your name on the front and back of the card? Why not use the space on the back for a self-portrait! Or a caricature! Then people would remember what you look like, too. Apollo: That's not a bad idea, actually. Trucy: Here, give me one of your cards, Apollo... Apollo: (...She's drawing something. Hey! My hair's not THAT spiky!) Apollo: And you're giving me this card because...? Vera: ...... Apollo: ...... Well, looks like we're finished here. Trucy: I wonder if Drew Studio is the scene of the crime? Apollo: Let's go find out. October 7Drew Studio Apollo: Wow, this looks like... it looks like a studio. Trucy: It's like life imitating art... Or, maybe, it's the other way around... Hmm. But the tape on the ground there... It's a bit jarring... Apollo: Yeah... Looks like we found our crime scene... Trucy: Apollo! Look at all those paintings! Apollo: Hey, don't touch those. Trucy: It's OK, I'm just looking. Huh? Apollo... Look at this one. Apollo: ...Looks half finished. (You can still see the rough sketch underneath.) Trucy: But, that's odd. The rough part doesn't look like the rest of the painting at all. Apollo: Yeah, good point. (That is odd...) Drew Misham's Paintings added to the Court Record. Examine evidence Portrait Thinking person Apollo: Well, what do we have here...? It looks like a person... thinking about something. Trucy: Maybe they're worried? Like, what should I have for supper: a hot dog, or a hamburger? ...... You know, I've always wondered about that. Why is there \"supper\" and \"dinner\"? Are they different meals or the same thing? Apollo: ...Maybe that's what this person's thinking about. Acrylic Porcupinefish Apollo: Is that... a pufferfish? Trucy: Apollo! That's clearly a porcupinefish! Apollo: ...They're not the same thing? Trucy: You know what gets me? They're got all these needles, right? But what's protecting that soft spot on the lower belly there? Nothing! Apollo: (...Must remember to keep Trucy away from small, round fish.) Landscape Rough sketch Trucy: Apollo, look at this painting. You can see the rough sketch! Apollo: Oh. Looks like it was only half-completed. Trucy: Huh? That's funny. Do the rough sketch and the finished painting look totally different to you, too? Apollo: ...They do, actually! (What's that all about...?) Trucy: ...All the paintings have a really different style, too. ???: Ah! I thought I might find you two here. Trucy: Ema! Long time no see! Ema: Oh? Seems like I run into you far too often. I'll bet I know why you're here, too. Apollo: You know about the trial simulation tomorrow? Ema: I've heard about it, sure. So Mr. Wright chose you, huh? Apollo: We don't even know what the case is about. Ema: Well, he was killed. The artist who owns this studio, that is. Mr. Drew Misham. Trucy: Misham... Ema: And his daughter was put under arrest. Apollo: Yeah... We just saw her at the detention center. Trucy: It was funny, though. She seemed more like a victim than the kind of person who could commit murder. Ema: You don't say. Not even by poisoning? That's how it was done, you know. Poisoning's a common way to get the job done, when the murderer is a woman. Trucy: P-Poisoning...? Ema: Anyway, Mr. Wright told me you'd be coming. Feel free to take a look around. I'll just be over here. With my Snackoos. Apollo: (We can't talk to anyone related to the case this time around... ...Which means we'd better find out as much as we can here at the scene. ...Or else.) Examine Coffee mug Ema: Ah, that's the victim's coffee mug. Trucy: Ah ha! So the poison was in here! This is my first time seeing a real poisoned mug of coffee! Apollo: I would hope so. Ema: ...... \"Poisoned Coffee\"...? Not exactly, actually. Apollo: What do you mean? Ema: No traces of poison were found in the coffee. Trucy: What!? Ema: ...You'll have to figure out the rest yourself. I'm officially not on your side, after all. Coffee Mug added to the Court Record. Coffee mug (subsequent times) Ema: That coffee mug... it's not what you'd expect. No traces of poison were found in the coffee. Apollo: Huh? Whaaaat? Ema: Yet the only thing the victim drank that night was this coffee... ...so the poison definitely reached him through this mug. Trucy: ...... I like you better when you tell us stuff. Ema: Look... Just figure it out yourselves, OK? I have my \"position\" here to consider. Floor outline Trucy: Eek, Apollo! Th-That's where the body was! Ema: That's the spot where Mr. Drew Misham passed away. He put the coffee mug to his lips, and the next moment... Apollo: There's quite a bit of paint on the ground. Ema: See that half-painted painting there? He must have been working on that right up to the moment he died. Trucy: Wow! A true artist to the end! Ema: Or maybe he started it a year ago and was procrastinating. Painting behind dresser Trucy: Hey... There's a painting hidden back here! Apollo: ...Hey, you're right! Trucy: What if it's embarrassing somehow, and he didn't want anyone to see it!? Apollo: You certainly seem pleased by the possibility. Trucy: Huh. It's so... normal! Apollo: That's hardly something to get mad about... ...... Trucy: Huh? What is it, Apollo? Apollo: Well, doesn't this painting look like... never mind. Trucy: ...? Apollo: (I'd better get a professional opinion on this...) Hidden Painting added to the Court Record. Painting behind dresser (subsequent times) Trucy: Huh? What is it, Apollo? Apollo: Well, doesn't this painting look like... never mind. Trucy: ...? Apollo: (I'd better get a professional opinion on this...) Letterbox Trucy: That letter box looks funny sitting inside a room like this. Apollo: Let's take a look... Empty. Ema: The other half of that letter box is actually connected to the outside of the studio. Mr. Misham would put his letters in there... ...and the postman took them away. Trucy: Impressive that someone still writes letters in this day and age. Or wrote, rather. Paintings Trucy: I wouldn't mind taking a closer look at those paintings. I just love oils! You know, how they're so thick? Is that the word? Apollo: ...These paints are all dry. I'm just surprised at how different these all are. Trucy: Yeah... And what's going on with this half-finished one? Apollo: It must have been a work in progress. You can still see the rough sketch below... Trucy: ...That's what's so weird. The sketched part doesn't really fit the finished parts. Apollo: I noticed. (That is weird...) Paintings (subsequent times, before presenting Hidden Painting) Trucy: Let's take a closer look. Apollo: This painting here looks like a work in progress. Trucy: But... the rough sketch part doesn't fit the other parts. Apollo: I know. (Very peculiar...) Paintings (after presenting Hidden Painting) Trucy: Let's take a closer look! Why are two of the paintings identical? Apollo: It certainly is a bit curious. (...And a whole lot of suspicious.) Paintings (after presenting Hidden Painting; after Red Envelope is updated in the Court Record) Trucy: Let's take a closer look. Mr. Misham sure worked on a lot of different paintings. You think his works really go for a 100 grand a piece? Maybe I should take up painting. Apollo: (I don't think his paintings are worth THAT much. Something's not right here.) White teacup Ema: I imagine this coffee cup was for guests to use. Trucy: ...Guests? Apollo: Did the police already analyze this cup, too? Ema: Not a trace of poison was found on that cup. Apollo: (So the killer was after Drew Misham alone.) Drafting table Trucy: Is this desk for painting, Apollo? Ema: That would be a drafting table. Trucy: ...Drafting? Ema: Basically, it's a tool for making precise diagrams. Trucy: ...Wow, painting is harder than I thought. Apollo: (Why would a painter need a drafting table? Was he an architect, too?) Equipment Trucy: What is all this equipment here for? It doesn't look very artistic, really. Ema: He had everything from a lathe to a laser cutter. Looks like he was ready to work on metals and wood, too. ...Though his equipment's a bit old, to tell the truth. Apollo: Why would a painter need all this? Ema: From the dust, I'd say he hasn't used this stuff for years. Apollo: (This corner doesn't fit with the rest of the studio.) Trucy: Oh, do you think I could borrow this? I want to cut a quarter in half to make a trick coin! Apollo: ...This is a crime scene, Trucy. Trucy: But these cost like 50 bucks at the magic shop! Desk Apollo: Let's take a closer look at this desk here. Desk drawer Apollo: This envelope has been opened and resealed. Trucy: Ooh! I know how to do that! You take a pot of boiling water, and hold the envelope up to the steam. The glue melts and it opens! Cool, huh? Apollo: Whoever did this wasn't so delicate. Trucy: You're right. Looks like they just ripped it open and stuck it back together. ...Huh? The postmark on this letter is from seven years ago! Apollo: (Why would someone open a letter, then seal it again? Hmm... I'd better hang on to this.) Red Envelope added to the Court Record. Desk drawer (subsequent times) Apollo: This envelope has been opened and resealed. Trucy: You're right. Looks like they just ripped it open and stuck it back together. Apollo: Very strange... (Why would someone open a letter, then seal it again? Hmm... I'd better hang on to this.) Feather Trucy: Hey, Apollo, what's this feather-thingy? Apollo: Isn't that a pen? Like an old-fashioned quill pen? Trucy: But it doesn't have a pointy end. Ema: That was most likely for sweeping detritus off the desk. Trucy: Wow, you sure know a lot, Ema. Ema: Bold and scientific, that's my motto. Apollo: (...Exactly what about that was \"bold\" or \"scientific\"?) Figurine Apollo: Hmm. Something about the way that figure is posed... Trucy: ...I've seen that pose before! It's you, Apollo! See, you're making one of your flamboyant gestures! Apollo: Please, I am a professional. (...I wonder why it's posed like that? Coincidence?) Journal Apollo: Is this... a journal? Trucy: Wow, talk about a clue! Let's read it! Apollo: ...... Trucy: Wh-What is it, Apollo!? He didn't write the name of the killer, did he!? Apollo: ...It's new. He didn't write a single line. Trucy: Argh! You had me going for a while there. Photograph Apollo: So this is Drew Misham? Trucy: And this little girl must be Vera! Ema: Yes, they took that some years ago. They look close. A happy little family. Apollo: Until you arrested his daughter. Ema: ...Ack! Look, I was personally against that, OK? She just didn't seem very suspicious. Scientifically speaking. Apollo: Uh huh. Right. Smaller frame Trucy: Ooh! Cute! Look at the tiny frame, Apollo! Apollo: Tiny is right. That thing's barely two inches high. What picture would fit in that? Trucy: None, apparently. It's empty. Apollo: (There's no glass in it, either. What's it doing sitting on the desk?) Trucy: This is a lesson for us all: be sure to check the size when you buy frames! Smaller frame (after Tiny Frame is added to the Court Record) Apollo: I wonder why there's poison on this tiny frame. Trucy: Very strange indeed. Wait, I know! I'll bet it was poisoned from the time he bought it! Haven't you heard about some kinds of green paint being toxic? Apollo: I don't think they sell that kind anymore. And the poison was atroquinine, anyway. (A tiny, mysterious, poisoned frame...) Paint shelf Trucy: Look at all these paints, Apollo! There's so many! He's got like... twenty kinds of red! We could repaint your suit, Apollo! How about this shade of... green!? Apollo: That'll be enough of that, thanks. Talk The victim Trucy: So, this, um, Drew Misham was some kind of artist? Ema: Apparently. Did a lot of illustrations for books, I hear. Had a lot of female fans, too, for what it's worth. Trucy: Oh? Well, I guess his stuff is kinda pretty. Like that oil painting over there, for instance. Ema: Um... yeah. That... wasn't one of his illustrations, actually. Apollo: (Huh? So it was a standalone painting or something? Is that what she means?) Ema: He was an odd bird, Misham. Hadn't shown his face to anyone until the end. Trucy: What do you mean, \"to anyone\"? Ema: He was always locked up here in this studio, apparently. His only connection to the outside world... ...was through letters he'd put in that letter box there. Apollo: Letters? Do people still write letters? Trucy: What do you mean, Apollo? Apollo: I mean, when was the last time you wrote a real letter? Don't most people use e-mail and stuff these days? Ema: Not Mr. Misham. Couldn't stand technology, it seems. He did everything by mail. Trucy: Maybe he thought that way was more artistic, you know? Letter Box added to the Court Record. Ema: In any case, the only person besides him allowed in here... ...was his daughter, Vera. Trucy: Oh, you mean the killer? Apollo: ...The \"suspect\", please. Ema: We took some fingerprints, of course. The only ones found in the room were Mr. Misham's and Vera's, basically. Trucy: \"Basically\"...? Ema: Actually, last night... ...Mr. Misham gave an interview to a reporter for the first time. It happened during the interview, apparently. Ema: His first interview ever...? Apollo: Could you tell us a bit more about what happened the night of the murder? The victim (subsequent times) Trucy: So, this, um, Drew Misham was some kind of artist? Ema: Apparently. Did a lot of illustrations for books, I hear. Had a lot of female fans, too, for what it's worth. Trucy: Oh? Well, I guess his stuff is kinda pretty. Like that oil painting over there, for instance.

Apollo: ...The \"suspect\", please. Ema: We took some fingerprints, of course. The only ones found in the room were Mr. Misham's and Vera's, basically. Trucy: \"Basically\"...? Ema: Actually, last night... ...Mr. Misham gave an interview to a reporter for the first time. It happened during the interview, apparently. Ema: His first interview ever...? Apollo: Could you tell us a bit more about what happened the night of the murder? The defendant Apollo: So, this woman, Vera... She's Mr. Misham's daughter, right? Ema: Yep. A real sickly girl, ever since she was little. Hardly ever went outside. Trucy: She did kind of give off a withdrawn sort of aura... Ema: She was home-schooled by her father, apparently. It was quite a scene when they took her to the detention center. She was screaming about how she'd die \"if they took her outside\". Apollo: That... does sound like a scene. Ema: In the end, she agreed to leave if she was allowed her \"good luck charm\" for company. Trucy: Her \"good luck charm\"...? Ema: Apparently, she has this charm that magically gives her the courage to go outside. Apollo: (...Why can't I ever get a normal client?) Trucy: But why would a shut-in daughter kill her own dad? Ema: Don't look at me. Apollo: So, about the poison... It was found to be in his coffee, right...? Ema: No... Not precisely. Trucy: Not precisely? What does that mean? Apollo: (It means \"see for yourself\", I think.) The night of the crime (appears after \"The victim\"; before adding Tiny Frame to the Court Record and updating Red Envelope in the Court Record) Ema: Like I said. Last night was the first time someone from the \"outside\" came into this studio. I guess mysterious painters who never go outside make for good articles. Apollo: And it just so happened that he died the night of his first interview...? Ema: ...At around 9:00 PM every night... ...Vera always made him a cup of coffee. Last night, he drank his usual coffee, and suddenly became violently ill... Trucy: ...And died? She poisoned him on the night of his interview!? Wouldn't the reporter see? Ema: He wasn't near Mr. Misham when she brought her father his coffee. He was checking out some equipment in the back of the room. ...Supposedly, that's why she didn't notice he was there. It was the reporter who called the police, in fact. Apollo: Wait, but why is she the suspect? If anyone is suspicious, it's the reporter! Ema: Yet the reporter never got near Mr. Misham's coffee. Even Vera acknowledges that. Apollo: (Regardless, I want to know more about this \"reporter\".) The night of the crime (appears after \"The victim\"; after adding Tiny Frame to the Court Record and updating Red Envelope in the Court Record) Ema: Like I said. Last night was the first time someone from the \"outside\" came into this studio. I guess mysterious painters who never go outside make for good articles.

Even Vera acknowledges that. Apollo: (Regardless, I want to know more about this \"reporter\".) So, about this reporter... Ema: I can't tell you much. I hear he's going to be a witness tomorrow, though. Leads to: \"I thought so.\" Forensic science (appears after presenting Red Envelope or examining lip mark on Coffee Mug or seal on Red Envelope) Apollo: (I bet Ema could help us out here...) Trucy: Don't forget, flattery will get you everywhere with her, Apollo! Ema: Huh? What are you two whispering about? Apollo: Well... I was thinking. I mean, what is it we always do when we run into you at a crime scene? What is it we always do... scientifically? Ema: Ah, you know me too well! OK... Apollo: OK... meaning we can get erm, scientific now? Ema: Oh, I suppose. Just this once! Bring me anything you find suspicious and we'll check it out. Forensic science (subsequent times) Apollo: I was hoping we could do a little forensics works... Emma: ...I suppose. If we must. Just this once! Present Portrait, Acrylic, or Landscape Apollo: Ema, about this painting... Ema: Oh, that? Quite good, isn't it. Apollo: Er, that's not what I wanted to ask you about. Ema: You want to examine it, is that it? I'd be happy to let you, if you had a good reason. But without that... sorry. Apollo: (...I guess she wants us to do a little footwork on our own first.) Hidden Painting Apollo: Oh, Ema, I was wondering about this painting here... Ema: Ah. Aaah. That one? What about it? Apollo: \"What about it\"!? Trucy: Yeah, what about it, Apollo? Apollo: Take a closer look at it, both of you. Now... look at this one. This is the third painting he was working on. Trucy: Hey. They're the same! Ema: ...I was hoping you wouldn't find that. You're right, though. Drew Misham was copying this painting. Trucy: Wow. It's pretty good! Apollo: (Copying a painting...? What for?) Coffee Mug Apollo: So, Ema, about this coffee mug... Ema: I hope you aren't trying to grill me for information. You know I'm not talking. Apollo: ...I suppose you are the detective here. Ema: Why don't you two take a look yourselves? If you find a clue, I might not be unwilling to lend a hand. Trucy: ...I think she's going to help us, Apollo. Apollo: Let's check out this mug, shall we? Coffee Mug (after examining lip mark) Apollo: Um, Ema, about this mug... ...there's a pale blue, uh, \"residue\" on the rim. Ema: Eh? Ah! Th-That! Yes, well, it's just a rumor... ...but I've heard there's a kind of coffee called \"Blue Mountain\"! Apollo: I'm pretty sure it isn't actually blue, Ema. Ema: Ah. Right. OK, you got me. That's left over from my testing spray. Trucy: Forensic science! I knew your hobby was behind this somehow, Ema! Ema: It's not a \"hobby\"! Trucy: So, what kind of scientific stuff were you up to? Ema: This spray, that's what. It turns blue when it touches poison. Apollo: So, the poison that killed the victim was on this mug? Ema: That's right. See? It wasn't in the coffee. The killer applied it to the rim of the mug itself! Trucy: Wow! Science is amazing! Apollo: (It certainly is helpful... Maybe Ema'd be willing to help us out a bit more...) Trucy: You should try buttering her up, Apollo. They say flattery will get you everywhere. Apollo: (It's certainly worth talking to her a bit more.) Coffee Mug (after examining lip mark and clearing \"Forensic science\" Talk option) Apollo: Um, Ema, about this mug... ...there's a pale blue, uh, \"residue\" on the rim. Ema: Eh? Ah! Th-That! Yes, well, it's just a rumor... ...but I've heard there's a kind of coffee called \"Blue Mountain\"! Apollo: I'm pretty sure it isn't actually blue, Ema. Ema: Ah. Right. OK, you got me. That's left over from my testing spray. Trucy: Forensic science! I knew your hobby was behind this somehow, Ema! Ema: It's not a \"hobby\"! Trucy: So, what kind of scientific stuff were you up to?

Trucy: You should try buttering her up, Apollo. They say flattery will get you everywhere. Apollo: (It's certainly worth talking to her a bit more.) Um, about poison analysis... Ema: ...I was afraid you were going to ask about that. See, this solution is used to test for atroquinine. Trucy: Atro... huh? Ema: Atroquinine! The deadly poison found in the autopsy! Apollo: (...Uh oh, I know that spark in her eyes. She's getting excited. Best tread lightly.) Ema: It's one of the most virulent poisons, but is absorbed into the body astonishingly slowly. It takes at least 15 minutes from the time of ingestion for adverse effects to show. Oh, and guess what!? Recent research has shown... Apollo: Th-That's fine, really. We don't need to know all the gory details. Trucy: I think I get it. You just spray this stuff on something you want to test, right? Ema: Precisely! You can find even the slightest trace of poison with this! Trucy: I wanna try, too, Ema! Pretty please? Ema: You don't have to ask twice! ...I already used it on everything suspicious, of course. Trucy: Yay! Let's give it a whirl, Apollo! Apollo: Aaaaugh! What are you doing!? Trucy: I was just seeing if I got a reaction off of you. Apollo: How's this for a reaction: Never do that again! I'm not poisonous! Trucy: Tell that to those hapless witnesses on the stand! Apollo: (Let's just get down to checking for real poisons, shall we?) Go back Leads to: \"Too bad. No reaction there.\" Trucy: Too bad. No reaction there. Apollo: I'm sure Ema checked out all the likely spots. ...Wait a second. Trucy: What is it, Apollo? Apollo: Did you spray that little desk over there? Trucy: I don't think so... The spray probably can't reach that far, you know? Apollo: Let's check it out, just to be sure. Spray smaller frame Leads to: \"Eeeeeeeeeeeek! A reaction, Apollo!\" Trucy: Eeeeeeeeeeeek! A reaction, Apollo! Ema: Aaaaaaugh! Where, where!? Trucy: The inside of that cute little frame! Look! Ema: Well, would you look at that. Nice going, Trucy. Trucy: I'm known to work magic! Apollo: (Never mind that I was the one who found it.) Tiny Frame added to the Court Record. Apollo: (Why would the inside of that frame have poison on it? ...It looks like we found the only other place that was poisoned, in any case.) Coffee Mug (after Tiny Frame is added to the Court Record) Trucy: Are we going to test for poison again? Apollo: Why not? Just to be sure. Ema: But, you found your clue already. Isn't that enough? This stuff isn't cheap, you know? Trucy: I bet she doesn't have a lot of spending money. Apollo: (I bet she spends it all on Snackoos.) Red Envelope Apollo: Ema, about this... Ema: Oh! Th-That! Y-Yes, why that's a bright red envelope. Apollo: (She sure is jumpy...) Trucy: Someone opened this, didn't they? Ema: ...... My lips are sealed. Apollo: Y-Your \"lips are sealed\"...? (That's a first!) You mean... you know what's inside the envelope? Ema: Sure. I read it, after all. Trucy: Ah! You mean you were the one who ripped this open!? Ema: Hah! Please! I would have steamed it open. Apollo: (But she did sneak a peek at it, apparently.) Ema: Know that I have a powerful weapon on my side. Trucy: Weapon...? Ema: Yes! The use of tools! Highly specialized tools for information gathering. Apollo: (Tools I wouldn't mind getting my hands on...) Trucy: You should try flattering her, Apollo... They say a little praise can open big doors. Apollo: (Never heard that one, but it's good advice... Let's try talking to her some more.) Red Envelope (after clearing \"Forensic science\" Talk option) Apollo: Ema, about this... Ema: Oh! Th-That! Y-Yes, why that's a bright red envelope. Apollo: (She sure is jumpy...) Trucy: Someone opened this, didn't they? Ema: ...... My lips are sealed. Apollo: Y-Your \"lips are sealed\"...? (That's a first!) You mean... you know what's inside the envelope? Ema: Sure. I read it, after all. Trucy: Ah! You mean you were the one who ripped this open!? Ema: Hah! Please! I would have steamed it open. Apollo: (But she did sneak a peek at it, apparently.) Ema: Know that I have a powerful weapon on my side. Trucy: Weapon...? Ema: Yes! The use of tools! Highly specialized tools for information gathering. Apollo: (Tools I wouldn't mind getting my hands on...) Trucy: You should try flattering her, Apollo... They say a little praise can open big doors. Apollo: (Never heard that one, but it's good advice... Let's try talking to her some more.) About that envelope we found... ...I was wondering if you could help us out with that \"tool\" you were mentioning? Ema: Eh heh heh, you want to know about my tool do you? It's called an X-Ray Analyzer. Trucy: X-Ray... like the x-rays you get at the dentist? Ema: That's right! At least, that's what I call it. Trucy: Huh? Ema: It has a real name, but it's much more complicated: the X-Ray Spectraliziation... ...something. How am I supposed to remember all that? Trucy: So, basically, it lets you see inside things... like envelopes? Ema: That's right! You're sharp, Trucy. But it's a bit more complicated than that, in practice, of course. Actually, to tell the truth, I'm not really sure how it works, scientifically. Trucy: Can I try it out, Ema? Please!? Ema: Oh, I suppose. ...Of course, I've already checked out everything suspicious myself. Trucy: Alright! Let's give it a spin, Apollo! Apollo: Yeeeeargh! What are you doing!? Trucy: Oh, just seeing if I could see through your hair... But it's like lead! Apollo: Point that thing at me any more, and it might all fall out. Trucy: Then I wouldn't need an x-ray machine to see through it! Apollo: (Let's just get down to business, shall we?) Ema: Right. Let's test it on a sample, first. It just so happens that I have a lottery ticket here. You set the sample in the device like so... Apollo: ...I don't see anything. Ema: Patience. There's no need to get all antsy. Look at the right side of the screen. That's the \"layer view\" of the envelope. Trucy: Layer view...? Ema: You've got it set to display the outside of the envelope now, see? Actually, it's quicker to just have you give it a try. Turn that dial there with [right analog stick / arrow keys] for me, would you? (Changed from [Turn that dial there for me, would you?] in the original release) That's right. That's how you choose what \"depth\" you want to scan. Trucy: Hey! I got something! Ema: See? That's how you can read the letters on the ticket inside. Cool, huh? Apollo: Except... I can't read them. Ema: Just turn the dial a little more. What you have to understand is that a sheet of paper isn't really flat at all. When you zoom in that much, you see that paper is like a bunch of hills and valleys. Trucy: Wow! Really? Ema: This x-ray device uses a beam with a wavelength of only 0.05 microns! It breaks cards down into thin layers, so it can only show what's written on that layer. Apollo: I'm not entirely following you, but what good is it if you can't read anything? Ema: That's why we go on to step two! Try rubbing the image a bit, if you would. Trucy: \"Rubbing\"? Like going over the image with [left analog stick / WASD] while holding [A / Space]? (Changed from ['The image'? You mean rub the screen?] in the original release) Rub entire area Leads to: \"There. That fixes the image on the screen.\" Ema: There. That fixes the image on the screen. Now, turn the dial again, just a little. Good. Now you can rub this image to \"fix\" it, too. Trucy: Hey, I get it! We just keep doing this until we've got the whole thing! Ema: Exactly! Not bad! Trucy: Neat! Let's do some more! Fully fix image Leads to: \"OK, let's print this one out.\" Ema: OK, let's print this one out. If \"BIG WINNER!\" ticket was printed Trucy: Woo hoo! I'm a big winner!!! Ema: Ah ha ha. See! This is the true hidden power of my weapon. Neat, huh? Leads to: \"Now let's try it out on the real thing, shall we?\" If \"TRY AGAIN!\" ticket was printed Trucy: ...Hmm. Does this mean I have to buy another one to win? Apollo: Well, it's Ema's ticket. Let her buy another one. Ema: It's OK, there's no need. But see, this is the true hidden power of my weapon. Neat, huh? Leads to: \"Now let's try it out on the real thing, shall we?\" If \"YOU LOSE!\" ticket was printed Trucy: Ouch. \"You lose\". Ema: At least you know where you stand, eh? Anyway, now you see the true hidden power of my weapon. Neat, huh? Leads to: \"Now let's try it out on the real thing, shall we?\" Ema: Now let's try it out on the real thing, shall we? Fully fix image Leads to: \"OK, let's print this one out.\" Ema: OK, let's print this one out. Trucy: Someone deposited $100,000 into Mr. Misham's account? His paintings must be really valuable! Ema: There's another page in there. ...Care to take a look? Trucy: You bet I do! If you're going to read someone's mail you might as well read it all! Ema: Here goes with the second page, then. Fully fix image Leads to: \"OK, let's print this one out.\" Ema: OK, let's print this one out. Trucy: ...So it was a letter about payment for one of his paintings. Apollo: Why all the secrecy, though? And... Trucy: ...And what? Apollo: ...Why was this letter the only one in here? ...It's seven years old, right? Trucy: Maybe it had some special significance to him? Well, Ema? Ema: Well indeed. ...... Apollo: (She knows something she's not telling us. ...Looks like she's keeping mum about it.) Red Envelope updated in the Court Record. Red Envelope (after Red Envelope is updated in the Court Record) Trucy: But we just did the X-ray detection thing! Apollo: Oh, right. Sorry. Anything else Apollo: Ema, I was wondering if you could take a look at this... Ema: Look, I'm a detective. A detective! You can't just ask me any old thing and expect an answer, OK? I think you need to be a little more focused in your inquiries. Scientific, even. Apollo: (Somehow I knew she'd get around to science.) Examine evidence Hidden Painting Peach Trucy: Hey, Apollo. This painting, I know it! Apollo: Huh? Really!? Trucy: It's that story where the old woman is doing the wash in the river... ...and this giant peach comes a' floating on down. Apollo: ...That might possibly be the strangest thing I have ever heard. Coffee Mug Lip mark Trucy: Hey... look there! That stain doesn't look so healthy, Apollo! That must be the \"Blue Mountain\" stuff we've been hearing about! Apollo: Something tells me that even Blue Mountain Coffee isn't THIS blue. No, this stain is probably... (Hmm, better ask Ema.) Lip mark (after Tiny Frame is added to the Court Record) Trucy: See that, there? That's poison. Apollo: Yeah. Trucy: Don't lick it, Apollo! Apollo: Don't worry, I'll be fine. Trucy: No, you won't! You'll die! Apollo: Look, I know! I meant I won't lick it! Trucy: Who knows what you do when I'm not watching... Apollo: (...The concern is touching, really. Next thing you know she'll be telling me not to drink coffee before bedtime...) Red Envelope (before Red Envelope is updated in the Court Record) Seal Trucy: Apollo, look! It's been opened once here. Apollo: ...You're right. I wonder if there's some way we can see what's inside? Trucy: Should I try to get it open and then stick it back shut? Apollo: Let's not tamper with the evidence, shall we? I've got a better idea... Trucy: ...Ema! Let's ask her! Tiny Frame Back side Apollo: Hmm... Looks like you have to take this back part off first to put a photo inside. Trucy: It'd have to be a really small photo to fit in there. Apollo: True. And that pale bluish stain... Why would there be poison in a place like this? Trucy: Well, there's one obvious reason. Whoever put poison in the coffee rubbed a bit on here, too! Apollo: That's not very obvious, Trucy. After clearing \"The night of the crime\" Talk option, then adding Tiny Frame to the Court Record and updating Red Envelope in the Court Record Apollo: So, Ema, I was wondering... What's the story about this reporter that came here for a story the night of the crime? Ema: Ah! I'm afraid I can't tell you, because he's going to be a witness tomorrow, I hear. Leads to: \"I thought so.\" Trucy: I thought so. Ema: I'll never forget that face, but what was his name...? Oh, right. Brushel. Trucy: Brushel... Ema: He's after a scoop to sell to the papers. Apollo: So a reporter comes for an interview with a painter. His first interview ever, and that night, he's killed. Seem strange to you? Trucy: Really strange. Ema: It does raise a few questions. Apollo: I'd like to speak with this reporter if I could. Ema: Well, I hear he's on the beat today, too. ...He said something about covering a magician. Apollo: Magician...? (Well, if it's not Trucy, that leaves only one other person.) Trucy: It wasn't Valant Gramarye, by any chance, was it? Ema: Yeah, something like that! He's got some big show lined up, I hear. Apollo: (So, he's out interviewing Valant Gramarye... Looks like I'll be heading out to that coliseum again sooner than I thought.) Ema: Here, I'll give you that reporter's card if you want. Brushel's Card added to the Court Record. Examine evidence Brushel's Card Front side Trucy: I guess you gotta have a good business card if you work freelance. Apollo: Really. What's this... a camera lens finder? Trucy: Do reporters take photos too? Apollo: I guess if he's freelance, he'd have to. Trucy: Maybe you should try being a prosecutor and a defense attorney! You'd always win! Apollo: Why don't I become a rock star too, while I'm at it? After clearing all Talk options in Detention Center - Visitor's Room, then visiting any other location: October 7Detention CenterVisitor's Room Guard: Ah, you're here to see Vera Misham? Apollo: Yes, that's right! Guard: She's in the medical office at the moment. Trucy: Medical office...? Is she OK? Guard: She's just lying down. Said she didn't feel so good. I'm sorry but I can't allow any meetings at the moment. Apollo: Most. Annoying. Client. Ever. Trucy: Guess we should come back. After clearing \"Valant Gramarye\" Talk option in Wright Anything Agency: October 7Sunshine Coliseum Trucy: Woo hoo! This is it, Apollo! The place where magic and dreams converge! Apollo: Just a while ago it was the place where murder and nightmares converged. Trucy: Let's go say hi to Uncle Valant! Apollo: (What about the case...?) ???: Waaaah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Trucy: Only a performer laughs like that... Valant: The young Miss Trucy! How often I hoped we'd meet again only to tell myself it was an impossible dream! Trucy: Tee hee, Uncle Valant! How's it going? I'm glad to see you, too! Valant: Of course you are. Apollo: (Humility is definitely NOT one of his stronger traits...) Valant: Well, Miss Trucy, how does the day find you? If you've come to give me flowers, do it after the show, I beg you. Trucy: Actually, we came to wish you good luck! And congratulations on your big magic show! Valant: Oh? But it is I who wish to congratulate you! Not everyone is so lucky as to witness miracles such as I shall perform! Apollo: (Yeah, yeah, you're amazing, we get the picture.) Valant: The world will watch in wonderment as Magnifi's illusions are reborn! Here, on stage! By my hand! Examine Blue Badger Apollo: ...Hey, that creature there. He was handing out balloons during our last case, too. Trucy: He's not a \"creature\", Apollo! Poor guy. Apollo: Oh, sorry. Was I mean somehow? Trucy: You know how hot it is inside one of those suits? He's stuck in there, with only the smell of his own sweat to keep him company. On the verge of passing out, he hands out each balloon as though it were his last! Apollo: Kind of takes the fun out of seeing the Blue Badger. Coliseum building Apollo: You know, I thought this at the time of the Gavinners's concert, too, but... ...this coliseum is just way too big. It's huge. Trucy: It's got a big-sounding name, too... \"Sunshine Coliseum\", was it? Valant: Ah ha ha ha ha ha! Would you like to hear what the grand finale of the show in three days will be? Trucy: What!? Really!? Yeah, yeah! Valant: Eh heh heh... The grand finale will be nothing other than... Apollo: Don't tell me. You're going to make the coliseum disappear, right? Valant: ...Ah! Apollo: (Oh. Oops. Looks like I was right.) Valant: ...... Trucy: Apollo! I can't believe you'd use your power of perception on something like this! Apollo: It was just a wild guess, really. Hot air balloon Trucy: Look, Apollo! A balloon! A hot air balloon!!! Apollo: With the Gramarye seal on it, no less. Valant: Well, this is a long-awaited revival, after all! And it's been seven years, you know. I've spent plenty of time and a pretty penny on promotion. Trucy: I hope it's a huge success, Uncle Valant! Valant: Oh, I intend for it to be nothing less, I assure you! Apollo: (They both sure seem excited about it. I guess it's a big deal for magicians.) Signboard Apollo: They've changed the sign since our last case. Trucy: It was all Gavinners back then, wasn't it? Apollo: I hope nothing bizarre and mysterious happens this time. Valant: But it shall! Why, the show itself will be bizarre and mysterious, I assure you! Apollo: I don't have a problem with mystery as long as it's legal. Trucy: I don't think lawyers and magicians were really meant to have conversations like this. Talk The big magic show Trucy: Everyone's talking about the big magic show! Is it true that the \"Gramarye Miracle\" is back after a seven year absence? Valant: ...Miss Trucy. I must apologize. This show, and this honor, should have been his. Trucy: Daddy... Valant: My co-magician-in-training Zak Gramarye... If that terrible thing hadn't... Trucy: ...It's OK. Valant: Your father was a great magician, Trucy. If he were alive, then I, Valant Gramarye... ...would have been proud to stand upon this stage as his assistant! Trucy: Thanks... Uncle Valant. You know, I'm happy you're doing the show! To think, we get to see the Great Magnifi's illusions again! Apollo: (She really is looking forward to this, isn't she.) Magnifi Gramarye Valant: My mentor, the magnificent Magnifi Gramarye was a true deity among magicians. A creator-god who gave birth to magic and illusions that defied our very imaginations! Trucy: I was so little when I last saw one, but I still remember his shows! He did wheelies in a sports car through the air above the audience...! And then sped off to outer space, faster than the speed of sound! Apollo: (I'm guessing that memory was a bit embellished.) Valant: For seven long years, the world has been waiting for a miracle to match his. As heir to the Gramarye Troupe's secrets, it falls to me to provide one. It is my god-given destiny! Apollo: Um... Valant: Yes! You, nameless face who speaks for the nameless masses. How can I help you? Apollo: If the world was waiting, why did you hold off for seven long years? Valant: Hmm... It appears the lad is uninformed! Perhaps you have heard of the magic known as \"law\" which governs our land? Apollo: ...I have, though I'm not sure it qualifies as \"magic\". Valant: The performance of Magnifi's miracle was impossible. ...A certain \"law\" prevented it for seven years. But no more! Apollo: (\"Seven years\"... That phrase sure likes to pop up, doesn't it...) Trucy: ...And why was that? Valant: A little matter called \"performance rights\", Miss Trucy. Performance rights (appears after \"Magnifi Gramarye\") Trucy: Can you tell us about these \"performance rights\"? Valant: Magnifi's magic relied on an incredibly innovative idea... a \"trick\", if you will. That trick... was considered his property, and as such, was protected by property laws. Apollo: Intellectual property, maybe? Valant: Magnifi knew this and bequeathed it in his will... ...to one person. Apollo: You mean... him!? Valant: Yes. Miss Trucy, it was your father. Zak Gramarye was the inheritor of the Gramarye Miracle! Trucy: Daddy... Valant: Yet, as you well know, he is gone. He disappeared suddenly, seven years ago. Apollo: (I think I see where this story is going...) Once a person is classified missing for a certain period of time... ...they're considered legally deceased, correct? Valant: ...In all absoluteness. Those rolled-up sleeves conceal your competence well, young man! That \"certain period of time\" of which you speak... is seven years. Trucy: Ah... Valant: Yes, Miss Trucy... Though it pains me to say it. This past spring... April to be precise, was the time. Your father was legally declared deceased. In the absence of a formal will... ...the secrets of our mighty mentor Magnifi passed to me. This was, in fact, stipulated in the will by Magnifi himself. Trucy: Is... that how it works, Apollo? Apollo: Yeah. It's called \"death in absentia\". He's declared missing... permanently. Trucy: Daddy... Mr. Brushel, Journalist (appears after presenting Brushel's Card) Valant: A man by that name called on me just now. Apollo: Just now... Valant: Valant's vision is always toward tomorrow! Valant's feet step always forward! ...That is all. Trucy: That's all... very confusing. Valant: I am to perform a big magic show, yes? I wanted someone to cover it. Yet, he had ears only for that incident... Apollo: That incident? Valant: In any case, I requested that the rapacious reporter remove himself. So a painter has died, what of it!? It is but a footnote in the footlights compared to the magic of Gramarye! Trucy: Uncle Valant! Do you know where the reporter went? Valant: ...I recommended he visit that place popular with penalized perpetrators. Apollo: (The detention center...?) Valant: He was a rude individual. Might I see that card? Apollo: Uh, sure... Valant: ...He would tear apart my respectability? I will tear apart him! Trucy: Ooh! Here it comes, Apollo! Uncle Valant's big magic trick! Apollo: Is he going to fix the card? (Not sure that qualifies as \"big\" magic...) Trucy: ...... Valant: ...... Trucy: What happened to the big magic...? Valant: Ah ha ha ha ha ha! Is it not more miraculous for it to stay ripped? Apollo: (He must have really not liked that journalist...) Mr. Brushel, Journalist (subsequent times) Valant: A man by that name called on me just now. Apollo: Just now...? Valant: Valant's vision is always toward tomorrow! Valant's feet step always forward! ...That is all. Trucy: That's all... very confusing. Valant: I am to perform a big magic show, yes? I wanted someone to cover it. Yet, he had ears only for that incident... Apollo: That incident? Valant: In any case, I requested that the rapacious reporter remove himself. So a painter has died, what of it!? It is but a footnote in the footlights compared to the magic of Gramarye! Trucy: Uncle Valant! Do you know where the reporter went? Valant: ...I recommended he visit that place popular with penalized perpetrators. Apollo: (The detention center...?) Present Gramarye Envelope Apollo: Um, I was wondering if you could tell me about this? Valant: Ah ha! Why, that bears the Gramarye seal! ...... Hmm. Trucy: ...Uncle Valant? Is something wrong? Valant: ...Trucy. Where... did you get this? Trucy: Huh? Um, Daddy gave it to me. Valant: Your... Y-Y-Y-Your D-D-D-Daddy!? My partner, Zak Gramar-- Trucy: No, no, no. My other daddy, Phoenix Wright! Valant: Why now... Why would your Lord Daddy...!? Apollo: (\"Lord Daddy\"? That's kind of stretching the whole archaic thing a bit...) Valant: This signature upon the back. Do you recognize it? That belongs to none other than Zak Gramarye! Trucy: Whaaaaaaaaat!? Daddy signed this!? Valant: Might I be so bold as to open it? Apollo: ...I-I'm sorry, but I can't let you do that! Valant: Mmmmnk. Ah... Ah. Apollo: (What's in this envelope, I wonder...?) Gramarye Envelope (subsequent times) Valant: This signature... Why, it's none other than Zak Gramarye! Perhaps I might take a look inside? Apollo: No means no! Trucy's father didn't want us to open it yet. Valant: Hrmmmm... Ah... Ah. Your Lord Daddy... Why? Apollo: (...What could be in this envelope...?) Brushel's Card Apollo: So, a journalist was here on a story? Valant: All eyes in the universe are upon my stage. All pens seek to commit its mysteries to paper! Trucy: Um, his name was Brushel. Valant: Brushel... Brushel... Brushel... Brushel... Trucy: ...I think he remembers him! Apollo: He doesn't look too happy about it. Valant: Brushel... That cloying smell of mint when he smiles, yes... Trucy: Um, could you tell us more about him? What did he want? Brushel's Card (subsequent times) Valant: ...Put that away. I care not to see it ever again. Apollo: (He really didn't like that guy, did he?) Trucy: Let's ask why, Apollo! Anything else Valant: Ah ha ha ha ha ha! A challenge, is it? You want me to make that disappear? Very well! Give it to me! Apollo: Ack! N-N-No thanks! (Are all magicians like this?) Trucy: Apollo? What was that look just now? Apollo: I was just thinking how hard it is to get any information out of a magician. After clearing all Talk options and presenting Gramarye Envelope: Valant: Now, the time has come when I must return to make my prestidigitation preparations! By your leave, Miss Trucy. Trucy: Thanks, Uncle Valant! Valant: Three days from now... make ready for a miracle! Apollo: What do you think that journalist was after? And why did Valant react like that to this envelope? Trucy: I think it's time to pay the detention center another visit. Examine Coliseum building Apollo: Workers are busily preparing the coliseum for the magic show three days from now. Maybe we should go check it out... once this case is solved. Hot air balloon Apollo: A hot air balloon. You hardly see those anymore these days. It kind of reminds me of when I was a kid. Maybe Valant's playing the nostalgia card to drum up interest in the show. Signboard Apollo: That was a Gavinners sign last time, wasn't it? I hope nothing strange happens this time around... October 7Detention CenterVisitor's Room ???: ...I think I hear what you're saying. \"We're All Doing It For The Money\", end quote. Guard: No no no no! Not at all! Apollo: ...Looks like someone's already meeting here. Trucy: Maybe that reporter? ???: Hey there! How ya doing? Who might you be? Apollo: Ah, sorry, we didn't know someone was already here. I'm Apollo Justice, attorney at law. (Talk about a nervous monkey.) ???: You? You're Justice!? You? Apollo: You... know me? ???: Do I know you? Of course I know you! \"Stares Down Witnesses On Stand Till They Spill Beans\", end quote. Apollo: Th-That's not true! (What's he writing...?) Trucy: Are you a reporter by any chance? ???: Woo! You! You're Trucy! Trucy: Eh? Am I famous? ???: Oh yeah. Oh yeah! \"Trucy Wright Hates Carrying A Bag: Puts Everything She Owns In Her Panties\", end quote. Trucy: Eeeeeeeeeeek! That's so not true! ???: Just hold on to your breeches, there. I'll wrap up this interview in a jiffy. Trucy: Interview...? ???: So, guard. I think I know what's going on here. \"Guarding Rooms Is My Life. What Else Could I Possibly Need?\" end quote. Guard: No! How many times do I have to tell you this? Look, I've got work to do. You deal with him. Trucy: Um... did you come here to interview the guard? ???: Ooh wee, what a pickle! \"Accused Wouldn't Talk, Had To Interview Someone Or Go Plum Crazy\", end quote. Trucy: Huh... Apollo: ...I should've guessed. ???: Where're my manners!? Brushel: Name's Brushel. Spark Brushel. \"I'm Not Picky -- Journalist Just Closes Eyes, Writes\", end quote. Apollo: (What's that nauseatingly strong mint smell every time he grins?) Brushel: Until you've been interviewed by me, you don't know what thrilling is! \"Wild Romp Through Crossroads Of Mayhem, Madness\", end quote. Apollo: ...I can see that. (He's writing something again! Well, if he's a reporter, maybe he knows something...) Talk Spark Brushel Trucy: So, Mr. Brushel... You're a journalist? Brushel: Ah me? Look, let me state one thing for the record here... Trucy: ...Y-Yes? Brushel: I'm the interviewer. You understand, yeah? \"I'm The One Asking The Questions Here\", end quote. Trucy: OK... Brushel: ...For instance! You think a movie director watches movies? Trucy: ...Well, I think he probably does. Brushel: Exactly! I knew you'd understand. Apollo: (...Huh?) The night of the crime Trucy: So, the night of the murder... ...you were at Drew Studio? Brushel: Who? Me? Look, let me state one thing for the record... Trucy: ...Y-Yes? Brushel: I may look calm and collected, but I'm busy. Real busy. Always on the road. \"Journalist Always Buys One-Way Tickets, Never Looks Back\", end quote. Trucy: I can understand that philosophy, but... Brushel: You want to know the thing about one-way tickets? Once you use them, they're gone. ...All because you have to give them to the guy at the airport. Trucy: True enough. But don't they give normal tickets away, too? Brushel: Exactly! See? It's the same thing! Trucy: ...What is? Apollo: (*sigh*) The interview Trucy: So, you went to do a story on Drew Misham... ...and he'd never had a story done about him before? Brushel: That's right! Look, let me state one thing for the record here... Trucy: Wh-What...? Brushel: I'm sure you're going to want to know about my source. What tipped me off to Drew? Why do the interview in the first place? Trucy: Well... yes. Brushel: Look, it's like... Oh! I've got it! Say there's this burger joint with fabulous ketchup. You think the burger guy's going to tell me where he got it? Trucy: ...At the supermarket, maybe? Brushel: Exactly! See? That's what I'm talking about. Apollo: (I think I may have actually understood that one.) Present Anything Brushel: Ah, right. Let me go on the record here. Trucy: Y-Yes? Brushel: I know what you're going to say. \"Brushel! Take This, Write Brilliant Column!\" end quote. Apollo: I don't think so! Brushel: Look, buddy, I write brilliant columns about one thing: ...and that's food. Try to understand. Apollo: (What could he possibly be writing? He didn't listen to a word I said!) After clearing all Talk options: Brushel: Well, there's nothing I can talk about really. \"Walls Have Ears, Eyes -- Especially Glass Walls With Speakers\", end quote. Apollo: Right. Guess we'll leave then. Brushel: Ah, but since you're here... ...might as well tell you a tidbit of news I saw. Just for the heck of it. Trucy: Sure, tell us! ...Just for the heck of it. Brushel: I remember it like it was yesterday... ...I'd seen a movie on a trip, and wandered into this burger place with amazing ketchup... ...when an article in a tabloid caught my eye. \"Famous Oil Painting Stolen From Art Dealer's Gallery\", end quote, I believe it was. Apollo: An oil painting...? Brushel: Happens every day, right? But, I thought I'd seen that painting somewhere before. ...A painting of a giant peach floating down a river. Apollo: (Someone stole an oil painting... of a giant peach.) Brushel: \"Journalist Can Smell Scoop Better Than Burgers\", end quote. October 7Drew Studio Ema: Well, how'd it go? Find anything out? Apollo: Actually, there was one thing I wanted to check with you. Ema: Wh-What's with that scary face you're making? Apollo: (And what's with the \"I know something but I'm not telling\" face you've got going, Ema?) Talk Forger (appears after presenting Hidden Painting) Trucy: So, what exactly is a \"forger\"? Ema: Well, basically, it's someone who makes \"forgeries\". Fakes, in other words. Trucy: Fakes...? Ema: Copies of an original. Exact copies, so precise, you can't tell them apart. Trucy: Well, why not just photocopy them? Ema: The big problem with forgeries... ...is that people try to sell them as the real article. It's a crime, of course. Trucy: So, Drew Misham was...? Ema: A criminal? I'm afraid so. He received money to create elaborate forgeries. ...To supplement his work in illustration, I guess. Apollo: I see. Ema: Actually... ...that's why I brought this here in the first place. Apollo: What do you mean? Ema: When you're trying to determine if a painting is a forgery... ...the rough sketch underneath can be a valuable clue. Trucy: So the rough sketch is like practice for the real thing! Like doing a magic trick in front of a mirror before you go on stage! Ema: ...But not in the case of a forgery. Not necessarily, anyway. You know what the finished product is going to look like, after all. Trucy: Oh, yeah. I guess you would. Ema: That's why I brought this. I'm going to use it to see what's under the paint of the finished pieces. Apollo: (I get it now...) Ema: Not that I really needed to go to such lengths. Seeing as how one of the paintings was only half-finished anyway. Trucy: ...Still, it'd be neat to see Mr. Misham's rough sketches. Kind of like what he was drawing when he thought no one was looking. Apollo: (True... That would be interesting. And maybe valuable for our case.) Trucy: You should try buttering her up, Apollo! Flattery will get you everywhere, they say! Apollo: (...Hmm, maybe I should ask Ema to help us out.) Present Hidden Painting Apollo: This painting... came from behind that dresser. Ema: Ah, yes. So? Apollo: ...It was stolen, no? Ema: ...... I was hoping you wouldn't figure that out. Apollo: Do you think you could tell us a bit about this? Ema: ...I suppose. It's what you think. Drew Misham... was a forger. Trucy: A forger...? Hidden Painting (subsequent times) Apollo: Ema... about this painting from behind the dresser there. Ema: ...Ah, yes. It's what you think. Drew Misham... was a forger. Trucy: A forger...? Portrait, Acrylic, or Landscape (after clearing \"Forger\" Talk option) Leads to: \"Um, I kind of wanted to see the rough sketch under this painting.\" Apollo: Um, I kind of wanted to see the rough sketch under this painting. And I was wondering if your \"tool\" there might do the trick? Ema: Oh, fine. Fine! Just this time, though. Trucy: Let's check it out! Fully fix any painting Leads to: \"OK, let's print this one out.\" Ema: OK, let's print this one out. Apollo: What... What the heck? Trucy: Wow, he really blows! The finished painting isn't anything like the rough! Ema: Devices like mine didn't exist until recently. He probably thought he could draw any sort of thing he wanted to for the rough. Trucy: What do you mean? Ema: Well, in the past, you could only analyze the composition of a rough sketch. Trucy: Composition? Ema: In other words, the traces of charcoal between paint and canvas. So you could tell if there had been a rough sketch... ...but not what it looked like. Apollo: Ah, I think I follow you. So, in essence, it wouldn't matter what was underneath the finished painting. Ema: Some pros would actually paint out a rough sketch entirely. Then do a completely new painting on top of that. Trucy: So Mr. Misham was drawing whatever he wanted before painting over them...? Ema: Possibly. Is there a problem with that? Apollo: (Not particularly... But something about the sketch itself is kind of... odd.) Trucy: You're awfully silent all of a sudden, Apollo. Apollo: You think we could check out one of the other paintings!? Ema: Well, sure. You like this detection stuff, don't you? Fully fix either remaining painting Leads to: \"OK, let's print this one out.\" Ema: OK, let's print this one out. Apollo: This one, too! Trucy: What's wrong, Apollo? You look so serious all of a sudden! Apollo: Um, you think I could just look at the last of these? Ema: Fine by me. Knock yourself out. Fully fix final painting Leads to: \"OK, let's print this one out.\" Ema: OK, let's print this one out. Apollo: Wh-Wh... What the heck is all this!? Ema: ...I hesitate to ask why you're getting so excited. Trucy: You sure your device isn't leaking some kind of strange radiation? Apollo: Trucy! Look at these three sketches! ...Do you notice anything? Trucy: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Th-Th-They're...!! Ema: Now you're both white as sheets! What's going on!? Apollo: These sketches... are of the three cases I worked on! Ema: What...? Apollo: The murder in the poker room at the Borscht Bowl Club! The dead man pulling the noodle stand! And then... ...the events that transpired during the Gavinners concert! Ema: ...What could it mean? How could he have painted those things... and why!? Apollo: That's what I want to know! Ema: Wait! Is Drew Misham... ...your father? Apollo: Give me a break! Does that seem even REMOTELY possible to you!? Apollo: (I'd never even heard of any Drew Misham before. I hadn't even seen a picture of him. But there were my cases, drawn on his canvas! ...Every single one of them. It couldn't have been a coincidence. Just who was this Drew Misham... and what did he have to do with me?) To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Apollo: No clues here. Turnabout Succession Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 Part 5 October 8, 9:48 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 6 Examine evidence Landscape Rough sketch Trucy: This rough sketch is only half-hidden by the oil painting. Apollo: I'll never understand artists. Trucy: Still, it's impressive. I wouldn't think you could hide such a dark sketch under a little paint. Apollo: Well, it is called \"oil paint\" for a reason. I bet it's pretty oily. The paint I mean. Trucy: I'm still waiting for you to get to your point. Apollo: Good morning! Vera: ...... Trucy: So! You're... Vera, right? I'm Trucy! Trucy Wright! That's \"Wright\" with a \"W\"! Uh, but not \"write\", right? Vera: ...... Trucy: Um! We're... on your side! You can tell us anything! ...Please? Vera: ...... ...Good morning... Apollo: ...! (She... She speaks!) Trucy: Hmm, not bad, not bad. But I think you'd do better with a little smile, you know? You're so pretty! You need to sell yourself, you know? Apollo: Trucy! Let's... take it easy for starters. Vera: ...... ...Thank you for taking my case... Trucy: ...! Apollo: (Okaaaaay... Well, that's a start, I guess.) Vera: ...... Apollo: (There she goes with the nail polish again...) Trucy: That's great, really! It's so cultured! Vera: ............ ...Want to try...? Trucy: Oooooh! Really!? Apollo: *sigh* Girls... (The victim, Drew Misham, was a forger. And a stolen painting was found in his studio. A life of crime, really... ...And maybe one that led to his death.) October 8, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 3 Judge: Well, we will now... er... *cough* Begin the, er, trial of... Vuh... Vuh... Vuh... Vera Misham! Trucy: ...Is the judge OK? His voice is all raspy, and he's looking around all nervous-like. Judge: Erm... ahem. The repercussions of today's trial will, most likely, be felt for a long time. ...And may, indeed, alter our legal system forever. Klavier: Today is a test of the Jurist System... ...and the first step toward a new order in our courts. Trucy: Daddy's secret mission! Klavier: The jurists will function like a jury. It is hoped their inclusion will help the courts to better reflect the people's will. Apollo: Why... aren't there any jurists in the courtroom? Klavier: Three closed-circuit cameras watch this courtroom at all times. The jurists have access to everything that transpires. Jurists! Judge well, and judge cool. Judge: N-Now see here, Prosecutor Gavin! I-I was going to say that! Klavier: Ah, my apologies, Herr Judge. Judge: Ahem. Jurists! Today, er... Judge today's trial \"coolly\", if you would be so kind! Apollo: (The jurists are unbound by the letter of the law. They don't affect the trial with evidence... but by their \"feelings\". And we're about to find out just what effect they're going to have.) Judge: Very well, Prosecutor Gavin. The details of the case, if you would. Klavier: The victim is the painter Drew Misham. He was killed in his own studio. His coffee... was poisoned. By whom, you ask? By none other than the defendant, Vera Misham. Apollo: Apollo: There wasn't any poison in the coffee! Klavier: Achtung... Someone has been doing their homework! Indeed. Poison was not present in the coffee... but on the mug itself. Judge: The mug...? Ah, residue was found on the rim, I see. Klavier: The autopsy report describes the manner of our victim's death. Judge: The court accepts this as evidence. Misham's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Judge: According to this report... ...the victim's death was caused by \"atroquinine\" poisoning. Klavier: A chemical compound that does not occur naturally. Lethal dosage is a mere 0.002mg. A touch of atroquinine in the body... ...is the touch of the Reaper's scythe. Judge: Very well, Prosecutor Gavin. You may present your witness. Klavier: I have for you today a simple man, for a simple case. ...A man who witnessed the murder in its entirety. Apollo: (That journalist, no doubt...) Klavier: The witness will state his name and occupation. Brushel: Ah! Right! Well, for starters, my name's Spark Brushel! My job is... a lone observer of the world! Apollo: In other words, a freelance journalist, right? Brushel: Ahem! If you don't mind, I'd like to state something here for the record. Judge: Yes, Mr. Brushel? Brushel: I dislike conclusions, specifically, the jumping to aspect of conclusions. \"Preconceptions Make Park Sandbox of Endless Desert Waste...\" end quote. Apollo: But, you are a journalist. You said so yourself yesterday. Brushel: ...Well, that's true, yes. But you must understand, I stand before you today a man with a dream! I'm offering you my testimony in exchange for exclusive rights to the story! \"Scoop Turns Mr. Brushel Into THAT Mr. Brushel!\" end quote. Judge: ...Let's hear your testimony then, shall we? Apollo: (A \"simple case\", eh, Gavin? For me, the jury... is still out.) Witness Testimony -- The Journalist's Story -- Brushel: I visited the studio around 9:00 that night to do the interview. The first outsider to enter the atelier! \"Journalistic History Made\", end quote! His daughter brought us coffee right after we started. And you know what happened next. \"Star Falls!\" end quote. No one else entered the room besides her the whole time. Judge: Hmm... That does sound like a simple case. Unless... you were the one who poisoned him! Brushel: Wh-Wh-Wh-Whatareyousaying!? Judge! Judge: Ahem. Need I remind you, the cameras are rolling today. I felt the need to be a bit dramatic. Klavier: You didn't do it, did you? Brushel: M-M-M-M-Medoathinglikethat!? Come on! That's like... \"Newsmaker Making the News\", end quote. Or even \"Contemporary Witch-Hunt\", end quote! I know! \"Wild Accusations Rock Courtroom\", end quote. Klavier: Ah ha ha ha. Rock, indeed. Trucy: Prosecutor Gavin sure looks like he's having fun. Apollo: I'm so happy for him. Judge: Very well, Mr. Justice, your cross-examination, please. Cross Examination -- The Journalist's Story -- Brushel: I visited the studio around 9:00 that night to do the interview. Press Apollo: Apollo: 9:00 at night? Isn't that a little late for an interview? Brushel: If the great painter Drew Misham says, \"come at 9:00\"... ...believe you me, I go at 9:00! The first, and as it turned out, last interview with such a prolific painter! Apollo: Right. Can you tell us what it was like when you arrived? Brushel: The first outsider to enter the atelier! \"Journalistic History Made\", end quote! Press Apollo: Apollo: You were the first reporter ever in \"Drew Studio\"? Brushel: Posterity will look back on that night as a turning point in journalistic history! \"A Basically Insignificant Step For All Mankind... But A Giant Step For That Brushel Guy\", end quote. Klavier: If no one on the outside ever had access to the studio... ...then it would serve to reason that the deed was done by an \"insider\". Apollo: (...By which he means Vera did it.) Klavier: So, how did this epoch-making interview go? Brushel: His daughter brought us coffee right after we started. Press Apollo: Apollo: ...Would you mind being a little more specific? Brushel: Oooh wee, let me tell you, I enjoy a cuppa. In fact, it all began when I was in third grade, no wait, fourth grade-- Apollo: That's not what I meant! Klavier: I believe I know what Herr Forehead is driving at. This coffee the victim was served... Did anyone other than the victim touch it? Apollo: R-Right! That! (That's what I was going to say, really.) Brushel: Well, now, if you've got a question to ask, you'd best straight up ask it! That's what I tell all the new recruits. Several times, if necessary. \"Write for a grade schooler\", that's my motto. Which isn't to say I can only write grade school-level stuff, mind you-- Apollo: ...Who touched the coffee!? Brushel: Dunno. I was in the back, looking at the studio's equipment when she served it. Apollo: ...... Klavier: ...And what happened next? Brushel: And you know what happened next. \"Star Falls!\" end quote. Press Apollo: Apollo: What's this about a star falling? Trucy: \"Star Falls!\" huh... It's like an old telegram! \"Send Money, Over\". Brushel: Zowie! You don't know? That's like a journalism code word. An important personage passes away... a star falls. Get it? Trucy: But there's no gravity in space, is there? I wouldn't think stars could fall, really. Apollo: ...Does this matter? Brushel: Hoo boy! This is good stuff, good stuff! How about \"Star Breaks\"... Nah... lacks punch. I know, I know! \"Star Dies\". Nah... lacks imagination. Of course, you could go with \"Drew Dies\". Straight, to the point. I like it. Apollo: (I think we need to hear about something a little more substantial...) The moment of death Apollo: Um, about when Mr. Misham passed away... Brushel: Hoo boy, what a scene that was! He puts his coffee mug down with a crash, right? Judge: Hmm... Yes, and then? Brushel: Then the cold finger of Death touches his spine! Life's flame sputters and fails! So cold was that touch, he could do naught but tremble uncontrollably! ...Actually \"life's flame\" is a little tired. \"Life's river froze over\"... Yes! That's a go. Trucy: ...I think he's starting his article already. Apollo: Could you describe that a little more simply? Brushel: Well, as you can imagine, I was pretty surprised.

The body arches back like a bow, the limbs tremble, the throat burns-- Judge: Th-That's quite enough of that! Some of us want to be able to sleep tonight. Brushel: Oh yeah? Well I want details, lots of juicy details! Klavier: For that you can listen to our last year's hit single. \"Atroquinine, My Love\", by the Gavinners. Available at all major music outlets. Judge: The point here is that the victim died of atroquinine poisoning. Well, Mr. Justice? How did you find that testimony? Very important Apollo: Well, as an account of the moment of the victim's death, I'd say it's very important. ...Please add it to the testimony. Judge: Very well. The court requests the witness add this account to his testimony. Changes statement from \"And you know what happened next. \"Star Falls!\" end quote.\" to \"Those spasms... That was definitely death by poison.\" Not important Apollo: (You'd think the moment of Mr. Misham's death would be important... ...But Mr. Brushel's story really didn't tell us anything we didn't already know.) Judge: Very well, please continue with the testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Brushel's coffee Apollo: So, you drank the coffee that Vera served you, too? Brushel: Course. \"When someone serves you coffee, you drink it\"... That's what my old boss always used to say. Never did get what he meant by it, though. Apollo: But you're still alive, which is to say, you didn't die. Brushel: Of course not! \"No Point Falling Before You're A Star\", end quote. Apollo: ...That's not exactly what I was getting at. Klavier: What were you getting at, then? You know the poison was on the rim, not in the coffee. Brushel: Oh yes, yes! There were two cups on the tray she brought. And one of the cups had Drew's signature painted on the side. Apollo: (Hmm. No chance the guest would take that one by mistake, I guess.) Judge: Well, Mr. Justice? Was that testimony important? Very important Apollo: We're talking about the coffee the witness drank. I'd say that is important! Judge: Very well, please add that to your testimony, Mr. Brushel. Changes statement from \"And you know what happened next. \"Star Falls!\" end quote.\" to \"I drank the coffee, too, but I'm not dead yet!\" Not important Apollo: (So Brushel drank the coffee, too... Doesn't look like this is going to lead to much...) Judge: Very well, please continue with the testimony. Leads back to cross-examination The \"star's\" coffee Apollo: You say Mr. Misham had the coffee, too. But did you actually see him \"drink\" the coffee? Brushel: Course! \"He Who Sees It Wins, But He Who Says It Wins Bigger\", end quote. I live in a man-sees-dog-eat-dog-and-writes-about-it world. Yet... Apollo: \"Yet\"? Brushel: I guess I can't say I \"saw\" him drink it, really. He had one so-called \"sip\", if that. \"Man Puts Lips To Mug, Drinks?\" end quote. Judge: Hmm. That poison is quite virulent, I hear. Brushel: My stomach did a so-called \"somersault\". Since I'd gulped down that coffee without so much as a second glance at it. Wait, maybe something's there! Some kind of so-called \"trick\"! Anyone want to venture a guess? For the record? Apollo: (Does this guy have a pause button?) Judge: Well, Mr. Justice? Did you find that testimony valuable? Very important Apollo: The victim drank his coffee, then immediately fell over? Brushel: Oh yes, yes. You can go to press with that one. Apollo: Your Honor! This is a vital piece of information! Please add it to the testimony. Judge: Very well. The witness will add this to his testimony. Brushel: Vital! Right! Changes statement from \"And you know what happened next. \"Star Falls!\" end quote.\" to \"He had one sip, if that. The next moment, he was on the floor!\" Not important Apollo: (The coffee Mr. Misham drank... That has to be important somehow... ...Nah.) Judge: Very well, please continue with the testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Brushel: Those spasms... That was definitely death by poison. Press Apollo: Apollo: You say it was \"definitely death by poison\"... How can you be so sure? Brushel: Hey, look, I'm a journalist. I've seen a lot of things. And I've had more than my share of experiences with so-called \"poisonings\". \"Man Eats Fishy Fish, Goes Bye-Bye\"... end quote. Apollo: (Food poisoning doesn't count. Hmm. Should I get him to talk about something else?) No need Apollo: (Let's just go with what we have for now.)

That's what my old boss always used to say. Never did get what he meant by it, though. Apollo: But you're still alive, which is to say, you didn't die.

Press Apollo: Apollo: You're sure you drank the coffee? Brushel: Oh yes, yes, quite. I gulped it down, felt that sweet scorch in my throat! Apollo: But you say the victim took one sip and fell over. ...And you still kept drinking? Brushel: Course! \"Drink your coffee when it's hot, never when it's not\". That's what my old boss used to always say. Never really knew what he meant by it. Apollo: (Hmm. Should I get him to talk about something else?) No need Apollo: (Let's just go with what we have for now.) Leads back to cross-examination The moment of death Apollo: Um, about when Mr. Misham passed away... Brushel: Hoo boy, what a scene that was! He puts his coffee mug down with a crash, right? Judge: Hmm... Yes, and then? Brushel: Then the cold finger of Death touches his spine! Life's flame sputters and fails! So cold was that touch, he could do naught but tremble uncontrollably! ...Actually \"life's flame\" is a little tired. \"Life's river froze over\"... Yes! That's a go. Trucy: ...I think he's starting his article already. Apollo: Could you describe that a little more simply? Brushel: Well, as you can imagine, I was pretty surprised.

Apollo: (So Mr. Misham drank the coffee, and fell over immediately... Hmm. I think Brushel's telling the truth, too. Hmm. Should I get him to talk about something else?) No need Apollo: (There's no real need to change the testimony. The problem with the testimony is already pretty obvious!)

Brushel: Course. \"When someone serves you coffee, you drink it\"... That's what my old boss always used to say. Never did get what he meant by it, though. Apollo: But you're still alive, which is to say, you didn't die. Brushel: Of course not! \"No Point Falling Before You're A Star\", end quote. Apollo: ...That's not exactly what I was getting at. Klavier: What were you getting at, then? You know the poison was on the rim, not in the coffee. Brushel: Oh yes, yes! There were two cups on the tray she brought.

Leads back to cross-examination Present Coffee Mug Apollo: Leads to: \"You know what I have a problem with? A particular property of the poison used, atroquinine.\" Brushel: No one else entered the room besides her the whole time. Press Apollo: Apollo: Can you say that for sure? Brushel: For sure? Sure! I'm sure. Drew Studio isn't a big place, kiddo. I'd know it if someone else had come in! Apollo: What if they had been hiding in there from before!? Klavier: Klavier: Even if someone had been hiding in the studio... ...they hardly could have poisoned that mug without anyone noticing. Brushel: You think I, Spark Brushel, would miss something as obvious as that? Nooooo way. Trucy: He sure makes it sound exciting. I guess that's his job. Apollo: There's only one moment we need to focus on, really. Trucy: ...The moment when Drew Misham died? Apollo: Exactly. There has to be something there! Apollo: You know what I have a problem with? A particular property of the poison used, atroquinine. Judge: Oh? Prosecutor Gavin was quite clear about the poison. A lethal dosage of 0.002mg paralyzes the central nervous system. If you drank that, even you, Mr. Justice, would be reduced to a quivering pile... Apollo: (Why are you using me as an example!?) Unfortunately, we weren't told everything. There was a vital omission in Prosecutor Gavin's information! Klavier: ...... Judge: An omission? Apollo: Atroquinine is as virulent as he says. But death doesn't come upon ingestion, not immediately. That's because atroquinine is slow-acting! Judge: Slow-acting! Brushel: Whatwhatwhatwhat!? Apollo: According to one forensic scientist... Ema: It's one of the most virulent poisons, but is absorbed into the body astonishingly slowly. It takes at least 15 minutes from the time of ingestion for adverse effects to show. Apollo: If we suppose that the moment Mr. Misham sipped the coffee was when he sealed his fate... ...then he would still have had time left to enjoy his last cup of joe! Judge: Order! Order!!! What's the meaning of this!? If what the defense says is correct... ...why, that contradicts the entire testimony we've just heard! Apollo: Well, Mr. Brushel? Anything to say... on the record!? Brushel: Slow-acting. S-L-O-W A-C-T... It was virulent, alright. Even then, it had already begun digging its claws into the journalist. Trucy: ...He's working on his scoop. Apollo: (*sigh*) Klavier: Klavier: ...It's \"Brushel\", ja? Herr Brushel... let's take a trip back down memory lane. Brushel: Huh? Klavier: Did the victim really die the instant he took a sip? Think it over. This is vital. Brushel: You know what I think? I think that was... \"A Not-So-Subliminal Suggestion\"... end quote. Klavier: I admit, it does cause a problem if he died when you say he died. ...I would be forced to say auf Wiedersehen to my simple case. And you would be forced to say farewell to your article. Brushel: Come again? Klavier: You can't write a story based on conjecture, can you? And as the case drags on, other reporters will pick up the scent. ...And you'll be forced to kiss your exclusive scoop goodbye. Brushel: Scoop... Scoop... .....................! Look, wait. Just wait a second. Just one second. Judge: We're waiting, we're waiting! Out with it! Brushel: I think I just recalled a so-called \"important detail\"! \"A Revival of Recollection\", end quote! \"A Story's Survival\", end quote! Apollo: \"Attorney Utterly Confused\", end quote. Brushel: Actually, I did notice something when I visited the studio. I'd heard of poison that \"takes its sweet time\", see! Klavier: ...But not what I've been saying for the last few minutes, apparently. Judge: Mr. Brushel! Are you saying you noticed something that explains what happened!? Brushel: You bet I am! The \"Antidote For A Poisonous Contradiction\", end quote, you might say! Apollo: Or \"I Still Have No Idea What You're Talking About\", end quote, I might say. Brushel: I figured it out, but only after an in-depth interview! See, thanks to my journalism skills, I know who poisoned that coffee! Judge: Order! Order! Order! Klavier: As far as I can tell, the witness is standing by his testimony. ...That Mr. Misham died the instant after he drank. Brushel: Of course I'm standing by my testimony! ...And my dream of exclusive rights to this story! Klavier: ...Ach. I suppose it was too much to hope for. Apollo: What was? Klavier: Of course he wouldn't choose a simple case, not him. Judge: \"Him\"...? Klavier: Phoenix Wright, who else? Apollo: ...! Klavier: Achtung, Herr Brushel! Report for us, if you would. What is it that you noticed? Brushel: ...... Judge: This court is a critical trial of the Jurist System. I'm afraid no room for doubt is permissible. You will testify to the court about what you noticed! Witness Testimony -- What Brushel Noticed -- Brushel: When I arrived at the studio, Mr. Misham was at his desk. He seemed to be writing a letter... but he quickly sealed the envelope. I thought nothing of it at the time, of course. Now that I think about it, what if he was writing a suicide note!? Judge: Hmm... A suicide note? Brushel: Yes... he had this look on his face. \"Man's Face Inscrutable As A Quadratic Equation\", end quote. Trucy: Suicide? Poor Mr. Misham... But that means Vera's innocent! Apollo: Would someone commit suicide in the middle of an interview? Trucy: Oh. Judge: Very well, you may begin your cross-examination. Cross Examination -- What Brushel Noticed -- Brushel: When I arrived at the studio, Mr. Misham was at his desk. Press Apollo: Apollo: Was there anyone at the studio other than Mr. Misham? Brushel: Well, his daughter Vera, of course. Apollo: Was anyone besides Mr. Misham and Vera present? Brushel: Not a single one. Not a cat, not a rat, not even a mouse. Apollo: The only person who didn't belong to that studio there... ...was you, wasn't it, Mr. Brushel? Brushel: Ah. Ah! I know what you're doing! I know your game! \"Attorney Uses Classic Ramsden Phenomenon Ploy\", end quote. Klavier: If you intend to suggest that this reporter is a suspect... ...I'm sure you also intend to present evidence supporting that assertion, correct? In the meantime, let's move along, shall we? Brushel: He seemed to be writing a letter... but he quickly sealed the envelope. Press Apollo: Apollo: So he put the letter away when he saw you? Brushel: \"Early Reporter Gets Worm\", end quote. ...That's my secret! Apollo: I'm not sure I follow. Brushel: It's the night of the interview. I arrive 15 minutes ahead of schedule! The handle turns, the door opens, and I barge in! Apollo: Are you sure that's OK to do? I mean, isn't that unlawful entry, really? Brushel: Mr. Misham sure seemed to think so! You shoulda seen him! He crammed his letter into that yellow envelope as fast as he could. I know a secret when I spot one, and that was one! Judge: It does seem significant. Well, Mr. Justice? Apollo: (I wonder... It does have the ring of something important...) Add to testimony Apollo: The defense finds this testimony vital, Your Honor! Judge: Very well, please add it to the testimony then. Brushel: Hey, why not? My \"account\" comes free of charge! Adds statement \"It was a yellow envelope. ...I heard it was left at the crime scene.\" No need Apollo: (I can't see what, though. Nothing seemed unusual.) ...It won't be necessary to add this to the testimony, Your Honor. Judge: Very well, please continue with your testimony! Brushel: You got it! Leads back to cross-examination Press (after adding statement) Apollo: Apollo: So he put the letter away when he saw you? Brushel: \"Early Reporter Gets Worm\", end quote. ...That's my secret! Apollo: I'm not sure I follow. Brushel: It's the night of the interview. I arrive 15 minutes ahead of schedule! The handle turns, the door opens, and I barge in! Apollo: Are you sure that's OK to do? I mean, isn't that unlawful entry, really? Brushel: Mr. Misham sure seemed to think so! You shoulda seen him! He crammed his letter into that yellow envelope as fast as he could. I know a secret when I spot one, and that was one! Apollo: Maybe you could tell us a bit more about this envelope? Brushel: It was a yellow envelope. ...I heard it was left at the crime scene. Press Apollo: Apollo: And you saw him seal this yellow envelope with the letter? Brushel: Hey, don't look at me like that! I saw what I saw. Trucy: Apollo! You think this might be... Apollo: ...Our big break. Yeah. (What I need is to show some decisive evidence now...) Present Red Envelope Apollo: Leads to: \"As it just so happens, there was a single letter in a desk drawer at the scene.\" Brushel: I thought nothing of it at the time, of course. Press Apollo: Apollo: You didn't think anything might be wrong at the time? Brushel: Hey, when I go in for an interview, that's what I'm there to do. \"Interviewer Finds Looking More Effective Than Caring\", end quote. Apollo: So what about now? Thinking back on it, did you sense anything strange in Mr. Misham's behavior? Brushel: Well, yeah, that's why I'm telling you all this to begin with! Judge: Very well, continue with your testimony. Brushel: Now that I think about it, what if he was writing a suicide note!? Press Apollo: Apollo: A \"suicide note\"...? Brushel: Well, yeah, don't quote me or anything. I'm just saying it's a possibility, you know? Apollo: So you didn't actually check the letter. Brushel: Of course not! It was sealed! \"Contents Of Can Unknown Until Can Is Opened\", end quote. Apollo: ...You can always check the label. Trucy: Do you think Mr. Misham was writing a suicide note? Apollo: If he was, that would solve the case in a jiffy. Trucy: It kind of makes me wonder about that letter... Apollo: As it just so happens, there was a single letter in a desk drawer at the scene. In a red envelope! Brushel: Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? Apollo: ...Prosecutor Gavin! Klavier: ...Yes? Apollo: Was a yellow envelope found at the scene of the crime? Klavier: ...Unfortunately no. But, Herr Forehead... ...it's easy to mistake the color of an envelope. Apollo: I guess. But not this envelope. You see, it was postmarked already. Seven years ago. Judge: Well, Mr. Brushel? Brushel: ...I can explain that. Drew, right, he wanted to get that letter in an envelope, pronto! Get it out of sight of my beady eyes, right? So he grabbed the nearest envelope and crammed away! Apollo: (And what about the whole red and yellow envelope contradiction, chump!?) Judge: Well, Mr. Justice? Have you anything to say to the witness's claim? Apollo: \"That night, the victim put a letter he had been writing in a red envelope\"... It's possible Apollo: It's entirely possible! Trucy: But Apollo! We checked the contents of that envelope yesterday, didn't we? Apollo: Oh... You're right! (Gah! The answer was clear if I'd only given it a little thought...) Leads to: \"...As it just so happens, the defense team investigated the contents of this envelope!\" It's impossible Apollo: That's impossible. Klavier: Ah, I like your expression. So full of confidence. Apollo: It's simple, really. Leads to: \"...As it just so happens, the defense team investigated the contents of this envelope!\" Apollo: ...As it just so happens, the defense team investigated the contents of this envelope! With, erm, the assistance of a forensic scientist. Klavier: What...? Apollo: Note that this letter is addressed to \"Drew Misham\". Brushel: Oh? Apollo: Why would he address a letter to himself? Let alone send a suicide note to himself! Brushel: ...... I... I've been scooped! Judge: Order! Order! Order!!! Mr. Brushel! Can you explain this to the court? Brushel: Oh, my, my, my. How could I have forgotten? I suppose this happens to the best of us! \"Reporter Gets Old, Forgets Lots\", end quote. Judge: I'm still waiting for an explanation, Mr. Brushel! Brushel: Well, that's the thing, see. After he put his letter in that envelope... ...Mr. Misham sat there searching his desk drawer for something! Apollo: His desk drawer...? Brushel: Yes! A stamp! A so-called \"Postage Stamp\", end quote! Judge: A stamp? Whatever for? Brushel: Well, to mail his letter, what else? And then, why yes, I think I saw him put it in his letter box. Yes, it was a yellow envelope, and he put it in that box! Judge: Well, apparently, this yellow letter has nothing to do with this case. Brushel: Oh, how I wish it did! Just think if that were a suicide note... What a story! \"Star Writes Suicide Note In Front Of Reporter, Falls\", end quote. Judge: Ahem. As I was saying, that has nothing to do with this case! That said. Apollo: Yes, Your Honor? Judge: It makes me wonder about the contents of that red envelope. $100,000 is quite a good deal of money! Klavier: So this was from seven years ago, ja...? Brushel: ...! So, am I finished? Here, I mean. Am I finished here? I was thinking of, you know, going home, to start writing... Apollo: ...Um, I hate to state what should be pretty obvious to anyone... ...but when you catch the scent of a story... ...you make that... er, rather unique face. Brushel: Ack! C-C'mon! \"Attorney Has Active Imagination, Little Else\", end quote. Judge: Even I noticed something, and my eyes aren't what they used to be. You know, I'm starting to understand what all this \"perceiving\" stuff is about! Apollo: (\"Judge Has Active Imagination\"... end quote.) Judge: Please, continue with your testimony. Tell us about the scent of a story! Brushel: Hey... I'm the one asking the questions here. Usually. Witness Testimony -- The Scent Of A Story -- Brushel: Actually, it took a bit of work to get a thumbs-up on the interview. \"Reporter Leverages Story, Gets His Interview\", end quote. The story concerned a certain case from seven years ago. That red envelope probably had something to do with it. Say what you will, but Drew's talent was without compare. Judge: So you threatened to go to press with this \"story\"? That's how you got your interview? Blackmail? Brushel: Well, yes. ... I mean no! No, no, no, no! It wasn't exactly black... I mean, I'm not... urk! Judge: ...Something wrong, Mr. Brushel? Brushel: L-Look! This is my story! My tidbit! \"Journalist's Into Is Livelihood\", end quote. Judge: ...I see. Brushel: While you have me chatting away in here, what's going on out there? What if some Wally Wordsworth or Sally Scooper gets wind of my story? They could be going to press while I'm going to waste! Judge: The court feels your pain, Mr. Brushel. Mr. Justice, let's pick up the pace. Apollo: (A certain case, seven years ago... Wait... \"seven years ago\"?) Trucy: ...? Cross Examination -- The Scent Of A Story -- Brushel: Actually, it took a bit of work to get a thumbs-up on the interview. Press Apollo: Apollo: The victim, Drew Misham, had an aversion to reporters? Brushel: Boy, I guess. Not even my considerable charms did much for him. Until I finally got my thumbs-up, that is. Klavier: Maybe you can elaborate on that a bit for us? Brushel: \"Reporter Leverages Story, Gets His Interview\", end quote. Press Apollo: Apollo: ...Exactly what sort of story was this? Brushel: Oh a little one. Like I said. \"Nothing More, Nothing Less, Nothing In-Between\", end quote. I might have suggested I had a lead on this particular story. But I didn't threaten, or cajole, or nothing! Honest! Apollo: (So a suggestion was enough to get an interview? Mr. Misham must have really wanted to keep it under wraps...) Brushel: The story concerned a certain case from seven years ago. Press Apollo: Apollo: A certain case, seven years ago? Tell us! What case!? Brushel: Let me state one thing, Mr. Attorney, and you can quote me on this! I... can't talk about that case! Apollo: Wh-Why not!? Brushel: It's about journalistic pride, and staunchness, and credibility, and connections! \"Journalist Reveals Sources Only Over His Dead Body\", end quote. So what'll it be? Gonna strangle me? Dead men don't tell tales, Mr. Attorney! Apollo: (He sounds pretty determined not to talk.) Trucy: Hmm. Our chances of breaking his will aren't looking good. Brushel: That red envelope probably had something to do with it. Press Apollo: Apollo: On the one hand we have your \"story\", and on the other, this letter. What makes you think the two are related? Brushel: Oh! Ah, er, I was just saying it's possible. Call it \"Reporter's Intuition\", end quote. Hey, I say a lot of things. You going to pick all of them apart? Be my guest! Apollo: (All of them? No. Just the incredibly suspicious ones.) Judge: ...I see. Anything else to add about Mr. Misham? Brushel: Say what you will, but Drew's talent was without compare. Press Apollo: Apollo: Just how amazing was \"Mr. Misham's talent\"? Brushel: Huh? Hoo wee, boy. I mean, hey! He's a star, man, a star! The flow of his brush is like a great, undulating river across the canvas! \"Artist's Paints Light Up Studio Like Sun\", end quote. Apollo: (This guy is full of wacky gestures... But that one just now was wackier than usual.) Trucy: He looks kind of nervous to me, Apollo. Apollo: Definitely. I'm sensing something different than before here... (Maybe it's time to bring out you-know-what...) Perceive sweating armpit on \"but Drew's talent\" Apollo: Leads to: \"Sweat much, Mr. Brushel?\" Trucy: ...That testimony left a bad taste in my mouth. Apollo: It all makes sense. Nothing jumps out as ridiculous. Trucy: I wonder what this \"story\" he's talking about is? It must have been good, to get an interview with a famous recluse like that. Apollo: (Something powerful enough to drag Drew Misham out of hiding. I wonder... Maybe it had something to do with Mr. Misham's art?) Apollo: Sweat much, Mr. Brushel? Brushel: Urk! Eh, yeah, well... ...a man can't help his glands, you know! Apollo: It's more than that. When \"Mr. Misham's talent\" was mentioned... ...you suddenly began to sweat buckets. Brushel: ...Ack! Apollo: You're hiding something... about his talent! Brushel: Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat! Th-Th-Th-Th-Th-That's r-r-r-ridiculous! Apollo: (Evidence time. Let's show where Mr. Misham's true \"talent\" lay!) It just so happens I have evidence showing the \"talent\" mentioned in that letter! Present Hidden Painting Apollo: Leads to: \"This painting was found in Mr. Misham's studio.\" Present anything else Apollo: Brushel: Er, I can't help but wonder what the court is supposed to conclude from this evidence? Apollo: Oh... Brushel: Other than that you've made a horrible mistake? \"Man Burns Bridge, Forgets To Cross First\", end quote. Apollo: (...Let's try that again. All I have to do is reveal what Mr. Misham really was. That shouldn't be so hard, right?) Leads back to: \"It just so happens I have evidence showing the \"talent\" mentioned in that letter!\" Apollo: This painting was found in Mr. Misham's studio. Brushel: ...! Apollo: There are two problems with this painting. The first is it wasn't painted by Mr. Misham. The second is that there was another painting in the studio... ...which looked exactly like this one. Except it was only half done! Brushel: ...... Apollo: Then we have a letter discussing a payment of $100,000. Which suggests a certain business operation. The business of making forgeries! Brushel: Aoooooooooooooogg! Apollo: ...That is all, Your Honor. Brushel: Everyone! Please, everyone! Can we keep this private? Please!? This is my story! My scoop! Judge: Forgery... that's a serious crime! Brushel: Drew Misham is known as an artist these days. But there were rumors he dabbled in another kind of art until a few years back. Judge: \"Another art\" meaning... forgery? Brushel: Drew Misham was talented, alright. Talented at making precise, detailed fakes. A fact that certain criminal elements were quick to discover. Apollo: Criminal elements...? What...!? You can't seriously be talking about... Brushel: ...Exactly. I'm talking about forging evidence! The rumors started circulating seven years ago. Judge: S-Seven years ago...? So, are we to understand that this letter... ...this payment of $100,000 was for...? Brushel: ...Exactly. \"Forged Evidence Nets Tidy Profit\", end quote. Judge: Order! Order! Order! Why, it's like our victim was living a double life! Apollo: (Ah ha! This is my chance!) So the victim had ties to the criminal world, right? He could have had plenty of enemies we know nothing about! Klavier: Klavier: This is my first time hearing of this \"criminal world\". We certainly found no criminal connections when we conducted our investigation. Apollo: Apollo: But how do you explain all this money? You have to admit there's a possibility of some illegal activity here! Klavier: Klavier: ...But there is no proof tying this letter to our case. Apollo: ...! Klavier: ...Our case was, and remains, simple from the beginning. Only the defendant could have poisoned that mug that night. And, you, of course. Brushel: Hey, hey, hey, the only thing I poison is my pen... when I'm writing reviews! Judge: Mr. Brushel, your testimony to this point has been quite unreliable. ...It doesn't speak well of your reporting acumen. Brushel: What're you talking about!? My journalism is rock solid! \"Journalism So Solid, You Could Stand An Elephant On It\", end quote. Judge: In any case... Let's hear a summarized recap of your testimony. If we can ascertain the situation in that studio from the recap, the trial is over. Trucy: Apollo! What's he talking about? Apollo: The cross-examination showed Mr. Brushel didn't have reason or means to poison him. As long as there're no other suspects... ...then the killer had to be Vera. That's what. ...This next testimony is our last chance! Judge: Mr. Brushel, your testimony please! Witness Testimony -- The Interview: A Recap -- Brushel: The only other person in the studio that night was the defendant. It was Vera who poured the coffee. She's admitted as much herself. The only thing that touched Drew's lips during the interview was that mug. And nothing left that studio after he died. Nothing. ...Clearly, the only one who could have poisoned him was his daughter! Klavier: A nice testimony. Clear, succinct... and without room for doubt. Brushel: Aw... Shucks. You really think so? Judge: I believe this clarifies the situation that night. Very well, Mr. Justice. You may begin your final cross-examination! Apollo: R-Right... (...I still have one trump card left to play. And I won't let this trial end until I use it!) Cross Examination -- The Interview: A Recap -- Brushel: The only other person in the studio that night was the defendant. Press Apollo: Apollo: But that doesn't prove Vera poisoned it! Klavier: Klavier: How many times have we heard that one, Herr Forehead? The poison reached its victim via that coffee mug. And from where did that coffee come, hmm? Apollo: ...! Klavier: Not to beat a dead horse again, and again, but perhaps you could fill us in? Brushel: I'm on it! You need a horse beat? I'm your man! Brushel: It was Vera who poured the coffee. She's admitted as much herself. Press Apollo: Apollo: And you witnessed her pouring the coffee? Brushel: Course I didn't witness it! When she came in with that tray... ...the coffee was already poured and a-steamin'. Klavier: ...Let us not forget the defendant has admitted to pouring the coffee herself. I heard her statement: \"I poured, I served, and I killed.\" Apollo: ...Wha--!? Klavier: Ah ha ha ha ha. That last part was just a little joke. Apollo: (I don't think I'm going to get anywhere with this coffee mug. I need to find another weak spot in this case.) Brushel: The only thing that touched Drew's lips during the interview was that mug. Press Apollo: Apollo: ...You're sure about that? Brushel: Well, to be really, really, precise... ...I was busy gobbling mint candies the whole time. Apollo: One of those candies might have been poisoned! Klavier: Klavier: Yet, at the time of the autopsy, no fresh fragrance of mint filled the room. ...And no \"mint residue\" was found. Apollo: ...! (It was a long shot anyway.) Klavier: Don't tell me you're still trying to prove this? You think the victim ate, drank, or otherwise ingested something other than coffee? Judge: Hmm. Well, Mr. Justice? If you have some proof... Apollo: (The possibility is there, I can feel it. Just maybe not prove it, not yet. And possibility isn't going to cut it, not now!) Mr. Misham ingested that poison via a route other than that coffee! I can prove it. (before changing fourth statement) Apollo: Proof... is possible. (I gotta risk it...) Judge: Oh? Excellent. Let's see your proof then. Please show us your evidence! What evidence shows that the victim wasn't poisoned via his coffee mug? Present anything Apollo: Klavier: Must I explain this over and over and over? We don't need possibilities, here, Herr Forehead. We need proof. Apollo: I-I know that! Klavier: You should also know that every proof has its moment. Perhaps you're a bit early? Judge: ...I can tell you what we know at this point: The victim put nothing to his mouth but that coffee mug. Apollo: (*sigh* Another hole in this case that needs plugging before I can prove anything. But first things first. I'd better uncover a weak spot before I try to strike again!) Judge: On with the cross-examination! Leads back to cross-examination I can prove it. (after changing fourth statement) Leads to: \"Proof is... possible.\" Not yet (before changing fourth statement) Apollo: It... can't be proven. Klavier: ...I do believe our little Forehead is growing up. Pity. We liked the rash, youthful Forehead best. Apollo: (*sigh* Another hole in this case that needs plugging before I can prove anything. But first things first. I'd better uncover a weak spot before I try to strike again!) Judge: On with the cross-examination! Leads back to cross-examination Not yet (after changing fourth statement) Apollo: It... can't be proven. Klavier: ...I do believe our little Forehead is growing up. Pity. We liked the rash, youthful Forehead best. Apollo: (Wait a second... We already know a letter might have left the studio that night. Couldn't that have opened another path for poisoning? The situation's already changed... I just need to take advantage of it!) Judge: Let's continue with the cross-examination. Leads back to cross-examination Brushel: And nothing left that studio after he died. Nothing. Press Apollo: Apollo: Not one thing...? You're sure? Brushel: Yep, sure as sure can be. ...Well, with one exception. Judge: One exception!? What!? Brushel: \"Journalist Spark Brushel Does Interview, Leaves Studio\", end quote. Ah. Ah ha ha! C'mon! It's a joke! Get it? Not funny, I know, but still! Apollo: (Did something leave the studio that night? Why does that sound familiar? Where have I heard something like that before...?) Judge: Now that we've proven our witness is a comedian of sorts... ...I'd like to turn to our defense attorney before returning to the testimony. Do you have any idea what, if anything, might have left the studio that night? Not a thing Apollo: ...... (I can't think of a single thing!) ...If anything did leave, wouldn't Mr. Brushel have noticed? Brushel: That I would, that I would! Nothing left! Save myself, of course. Judge: Say that again and you'll be held in contempt of court. Let's get back to the cross-examination, then! Leads back to cross-examination Just one thing Apollo: I think one thing might very well have left the studio that night, actually. A certain something that has vanished from the crime scene. Judge: By which you mean... ...something other than our witness? Apollo: ...Of course. Klavier: Don't tell me. \"Vera Misham\"? Apollo: Believe me, any comic relief I may provide is entirely unintentional. Judge: Then, let's see what you've got for us, Mr. Justice! Apollo: Well, this thing wasn't at the scene of the crime, so I can't show it to you. But I do have evidence that shows how it could have been taken from the scene! Present Letter Box Apollo: Leads to: \"This is the only link between that studio and the outside world.\" Present anything else Apollo: Judge: ...... Klavier: ...... Brushel: ...I find Prosecutor Gavin more amusing than this guy, really. Klavier: If that was comic relief, why do I not feel amused? Judge: We want evidence, not entertainment, Mr. Justice! Apollo: (There goes my career in stand-up...) Leads back to: \"Well, this thing wasn't at the scene of the crime, so I can't show it to you.\" Apollo: This is the only link between that studio and the outside world. Judge: A letter box? Apollo: What did Mr. Brushel just tell us? When he entered the studio on the night of the murder... ...the victim had just finished writing a letter! Brushel: Yeah, I said that. And yeah, it was true. Apollo: Furthermore, you went on to tell us... ...that he put the letter in a yellow envelope and put it in the letter box. Judge: Ah...! Apollo: But that very same letter box was empty! In other words... ...that night, the \"yellow envelope\" disappeared! Klavier: Klavier: ...Ah, yes, intriguing. So an envelope has disappeared from the scene of the crime. Of course... this changes nothing. Apollo: Huh...? Judge: He has a point, Mr. Justice. What we're trying to figure out here is how the poison got into Mr. Misham. Is it really important that this envelope the witness says he saw disappeared? Apollo: Well, if it did disappear, then something did leave the studio that night. That seems very important to me! Judge: Very well then. The witness will add this to his testimony. Brushel: You got it. Klavier: ...I still think this fails to change anything, Herr Forehead. Apollo: (I wouldn't be so sure. A letter disappeared from the crime scene that night... This is exactly the opening I've been looking for!) Changes statement from \"And nothing left that studio after he died. Nothing.\" to \"A letter was put in the post from the studio, but I hardly think that matters.\" Brushel: A letter was put in the post from the studio, but I hardly think that matters. Press Apollo: Apollo: Nothing could be more serious than an envelope disappearing from that studio! And you were hiding that fact from us! Brushel: Er, yes, well, actually... Klavier: I don't argue the possibility that a letter disappeared from that studio. ...But Herr Forehead, isn't there a much more serious question before us? Apollo: (...Right, how Mr. Misham was poisoned. I know. But Mr. Brushel's testimony has changed, which means the facts of the case have, too. And what he's told us means something entirely different now, I'm starting to think.) Trucy: Let's keep thinking, Apollo! Brushel: ...Clearly, the only one who could have poisoned him was his daughter! Press Apollo: Apollo: You say \"clearly\" as though it were obvious. But this claim that the defendant poisoned the victim is merely conjecture! Brushel: Ah, yes, well, you see... In my business, it's all about making the most ridiculous things sound right. A bad habit, I know. Judge: ...... Klavier: ...... Brushel: Yes, well, er, actually... ...I guess this is more a case of \"Ridiculous Journalist Sounds Wrong\", end quote. Judge: The court is forced to agree with you. Please refrain from wild conjecture. Brushel: Understoodloudandclear! Apollo: (If only I could believe that.) Trucy: What do you think, Apollo? Everything he's saying seems so... not flawed! Apollo: ...Well, that's kind of what you want from a testimony, really. (...I need to keep my eye on what matters. How, and why, was Drew Misham, killed? Vera poured the coffee, that's not going to change. But if that coffee didn't kill him, I need to find what did... and prove it!) Apollo: Proof is... possible. (Here goes nothing...) Klavier: You do understand what we need, ja? Proof, Herr Forehead. Not \"possibilities\". Apollo: Of course. And, Prosecutor Gavin, I hope you understand... ...I'm ready to give you that proof. Klavier: Wh-What did you say? Apollo: I have proof of the disappearing envelope! Brushel: I saw him writing a letter, I did! Judge: ...Which was picked up by the mailman, I assume? Apollo: Of course, which means... ...that envelope had a stamp on it. Judge: A stamp... Ah.................. Apollo: As we all know, stamps come with dried glue on the back. In order to use the glue you have to wet it... ...by licking the stamp! Klavier: Klavier: Feh. No one worth talking to actually licks stamps in this day and age. Apollo: Apollo: Even if you wanted to talk to him, you couldn't. ...He's dead, after all. Klavier: Klavier: OK, so he licked the stamp. But wait! How does that explain the atroquinine on the rim of the coffee mug? Apollo: Apollo: If he licked the back of a poisoned stamp, the poison would get on his tongue, yes? What would then happen if he put the coffee mug to his mouth, hmm? Klavier: ...! Apollo: Those traces on the mug weren't the killer's doing! It was the other way around! Judge: What!? Apollo: The coffee mug didn't poison Mr. Misham... ...Mr. Misham poisoned the coffee mug himself! Judge: Order! Order! Order! B-But that doesn't... Does it? Apollo: Recall, if you would... ...atroquinine is a slow-acting poison, yes? The poison entered his body when he put the stamp on that envelope. But his time wasn't up until the very moment he touched his lips to that cup of joe. Judge: You have something to add, Mr. Brushel? Apollo: (Uh oh. His nose is picking up another scent...) Brushel: As I believe I mentioned earlier. Brushel: Well, that's the thing, see. After he put his letter in that envelope... ...Mr. Misham sat there searching his desk drawer for something! Yes! A stamp! A so-called \"Postage Stamp\", end quote! Brushel: But you know, I don't seem to remember him ever finding one. Judge: Maybe he'd just run out? Klavier: Incidentally, we searched the desk drawer at the scene of the crime. There were no stamps. Not a single one. Apollo: ...! Judge: Hmm, that does pose a problem. How will you prove that the stamp was coated with poison? Apollo: Actually, I'm glad no other stamps were found. It makes proving the stamp he used was poisoned possible! Klavier: Ah ha ha ha ha ha. ...Good show, good show. You can't even prove there was a stamp at the scene in the first place! Judge: ...Well, let's hear what the defense has to say anyway. Where's your evidence that proves the existence of this poisoned stamp? Present Tiny Frame Apollo: Leads to: \"Well, that certainly is a cute little frame. And by little, I mean really little.\" Present anything else Apollo: Judge: ...... Well, Prosecutor Gavin? Klavier: I think our beloved attorney has been licking too many stamps in his free time. Apollo: (Grr... Do you smile like that when you torture all your victims, or just me?) Judge: Take care that we don't lick you and stick you in the letter box, Mr. Justice! Apollo: (...I think I'm making this out to be way more complicated than it really is. That stamp would have left a small atroquinine residue on something... But what?) Leads back to: \"...Well, let's hear what the defense has to say anyway.\" Judge: Well, that certainly is a cute little frame. And by little, I mean really little. Apollo: It was on the victim's desk, Your Honor. ...Quite empty, as you can see for yourself. Klavier: I noticed that too during my inspection. So what? Apollo: Ah, apparently you weren't as observant as you should have been. You see, when you saw this frame, it was missing something quite important. Judge: \"Missing\" something...? Apollo: Yes. A pale bluish stain on the inside of the frame... Atroquinine residue! Klavier: What!? Why wasn't I told about this!? Apollo: The frame is only two inches square. The face of the frame is even smaller. Maybe an inch wide at most. Klavier: You aren't saying... Apollo: ...Oh, but I am. Tell me: what fits in such a small frame? A commemorative stamp, perhaps? Judge: Order! Order! Order!!! The poisoned stamp was in this frame...!? Klavier: Impossible! Judge: P-Prosecutor Gavin...! Klavier: Why would he put something like that on his desk? Don't tell me he had it there so he could commit suicide if the mood struck! Brushel: You know, can I say something? I had a thought, see! Judge: What, Mr. Brushel, and please stop jittering around like that! Brushel: The victim was a forger, right? There's a lot of money in that line of work. \"Forger Forges Friends, Makes Enemies, Too\", end quote. Apollo: So the poisoned stamp might have been a murder weapon, aimed at him! Klavier: Klavier: ...Oh, rich. That's rich. Leave the ridiculous flights of fancy to the Gavinners's song lyrics, please. Apollo: (Finally, something we agree on.) Klavier: The stamp was a \"murder weapon\"? Nonsense! Murder is a simple business. Who would go to such lengths? No one. Apollo: Oh, I disagree. Klavier: C-Come again...? Apollo: Recall, if you would, the victim's reclusive lifestyle. Drew Misham hid from the world. He avoided meetings. His only contact with the outside world... was the mail. Judge: The... mail! Apollo: Now, if you wanted to kill someone you couldn't meet, but you knew read letters... ...a stamp would be the perfect weapon! Klavier: Ridiculous! Where's your proof? I want proof! Show us evidence that this poisoned stamp was sent to him... as a murder weapon! Apollo: (I might not have \"evidence\" per se... But things are finally starting to come together!) Trucy: Wh-What is it, Apollo? Your fists are trembling! Apollo: I think I know what happened! I don't believe it... but I can see it! I think I know how Mr. Misham was killed! Judge: Well, fill us in, Mr. Justice! Apollo: ...A certain piece of evidence points to the truth, Your Honor. I can show you how someone with the intent to kill sent Mr. Misham the stamp of death! Present Red Envelope Apollo: Leads to: \"Isn't this the envelope... the one from seven years ago?\" Present anything else Apollo: Judge: ...... I'm not sure it's entirely clear to me what this proves, Mr. Justice. Apollo: Huh...? (Was I wrong?) Klavier: I believe we have shown probable \"intent to kill\". Except the killer would be Herr Judge, and the victim, you! Apollo: Yeeeeargh! Judge: Consider that a warning, Mr. Justice. Think before presenting next time. Apollo: Yes, Your Honor. (Let's think this one over again.) Leads back to: \"...A certain piece of evidence points to the truth, Your Honor.\" Judge: Isn't this the envelope... the one from seven years ago? Apollo: Think about the text of the letter again. There were two pages in the envelope. This is page one. ...And this is page two. I want to draw your attention to one phrase in particular. \"...Send in the enclosed envelope with the enclosed stamp within 3 days.\" The enclosed stamp, Your Honor. Judge: Ah...! Brushel: In other words, if I have this straight... \"The Stamp! Poison! On The Stamp! Lick, Lick, Gasp...\" end quote! Apollo: Now, what if he had done exactly as the letter asked? Trucy: He would sign the document, put it in the envelope... and put the stamp on it, right? Then he would put it in his letter box...! Apollo: Fifteen minutes wouldn't have elapsed between affixing the stamp, and mailing the letter. But the clock started ticking, and when the time came... he drew his last breath. And the murder weapon would be taken away from the scene. Judge: ...Quite conveniently, thanks to the postal system! Klavier: ...Such a splendid imagination you have, Herr Forehead! Apollo: ...... Klavier: Let me confirm one thing with you, if I might. So, this \"poisoned stamp\" was inside this envelope from seven years ago... ja? Is that what you'd have us believe? Really? Apollo: ...W-Well... Trucy: It is a little bit of a stretch, but there's a possibility. Klavier: Yes. A very small possibility. How small, I wonder? Trucy: Um... Klavier: A poisoned stamp in this envelope? A stamp that then became the murder weapon? How do you intend to prove this seeming coincidence? Trucy: W-Well... Apollo: (Ack! It was seven years ago, and we don't even know who sent that letter!) Klavier: And your answer... is silence, I see. Very well! I move to... ???: ...It's not nice to pick on the Fr\u00e4ulein, Klavier. Klavier: ...! Apollo: Ah... Ema! Ema: Well? Like my Kristoph Gavin impression? Did I sound like him? Apollo: ...Don't quit your day job. Klavier: Don't you have a crime scene to be looking after, Fr\u00e4ulein Detective? Ema: Someone had to come dig you all out of the mess you're making of this case. Apollo: Mess...? Ema: You know, none of this would happen if you just trusted in science a little more. You can find out if that stamp was in that envelope, easy. Klavier: Care to explain yourself, Fr\u00e4ulein Detective? Ema: Glare at me all you want, but science is on my side. It's all in the residue, right? Apollo: That's right! The poison detection spray... Judge: Produce the red envelope at once! You can open it on the authority of the court! Spray bottom right of page Leads to: \"Well! Would you look at that!\" Judge: Well! Would you look at that! Ema: No mistaking it. That's atroquinine residue! Judge: I-I don't believe it... A murder weapon from the past... Now, seven years later, it bares its fangs at last! Klavier: Klavier: Absolutely outrageous! ...Tell me why! Why didn't this murder take place seven years ago!? Apollo: Well, um... Ema: There's one possibility. Maybe Mr. Misham figured it out. Judge: Figured what out? Ema: He realized that the person who sent that letter wanted him dead. So he sent his reply with a different stamp. Judge: ...And put his decisive evidence in a frame. ???: Brushel: ...... Judge: Ack! You're still here!? Brushel: C-Can I make a statement here, on the record? I, Spark \"Razortooth\" Brushel, claim this scoop as mine! \"Drew Misham Killed In Cold Blood... ...By Sender Of Seven-Year-Old Letter!\" end quote. Hmm, no, maybe something more succinct. \"Star Falls After 7 Year Delay\", end quote. Judge: Order! Order! Order! I see no room for further argument here. Though I admit, this is all coming as quite a shock. To think that the murder weapon reached his mouth after seven years...! \"Stamp Is Ticket Straight To Afterlife\", end quote! Trucy: Uh oh. I think the witness is a bad influence on our judge. Judge: ...I see no need for further debate on this matter. The sender of that letter seven years ago could hardly have been our defendant! Trucy: A-Apollo! Apollo: I think we just won! Judge: ...Very well! This court finds the defendant... Klavier: Klavier: ...Is this the bright future of our legal system? Judge: Prosecutor... Gavin? Klavier: A ticket to the afterlife from seven years ago...? Tickets for Gavinners's shows are invalid after two weeks. Judge: B-But it doesn't make sense any other way! Klavier: ...It boggles my mind that so many people haven't noticed this. There's a fatal contradiction in Herr Forehead's claim! Apollo: A c-contradiction? Klavier: A poisoned stamp was placed in this envelope seven years ago. Whereupon it was framed, until now. If that's the case, then why would Drew Misham have done what he did? Apollo: E-Ema explained that! He must have realized it was poisoned! Klavier: ...Therein lies the rub. Apollo: ...! Klavier: Seven years ago, the forger Drew Misham sensed a trap, and put the stamp in a frame. I do not debate this. ...But this begs the question. Why, seven years later, did he use that stamp on the night of the murder? Apollo: Ah...! Klavier: Surely, you don't mean to suggest that Mr. Misham simply \"forgot\"? He put the murder weapon in a frame on his desk for seven years... and forgot? You expect us to believe he sprang the trap on himself? Apollo: ...... Uh... Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaugh! Judge: While I admit, this is all quite shocking, myself... ...it does seem highly unlikely that he would fall afoul of a trap... ...that had been sitting on his desk for seven years! Trucy: A-Apollo! Apollo: I don't think we're winning anymore. Klavier: Ah, I'm glad to see we're all back in the real world now. Welcome back to reality! We've been waiting for you. Apollo: Apollo: OK... Then how do you explain the poisoned stamp that was in this envelope? Klavier: The \"poisoned stamp\"...? Where exactly is this poisoned stamp, again? Have you brought it to court for us? Apollo: Uh... Klavier: I see no proof that such a thing ever existed. Apollo: Apollo: What about the atroquinine residue, huh!? Klavier: Oh, I agree, that does seem to be atroquinine residue. But, Herr Forehead, it's certainly no stamp. Apollo: ...! Y-Yeah, but... Klavier: Even if your precious poisoned stamp did exist... ...Drew Misham never would have used it. ...That is all. Apollo: ...... Urk. Judge: I believe we've come to a conclusion. Again. Trucy: A-Apollo! Were we wrong the whole time? Apollo: I-I can't believe it! The poison traces match up! It can't be coincidence! Judge: I'd like to bring some closure to this issue, sometime this year. ...Mr. Justice? Apollo: ...Yes, Your Honor! Judge: Let's review the facts, and see where we stand. Seven years ago, Drew Misham received a red envelope. There were traces of the poison atroquinine on the document inside that envelope. A similar trace was also found at the crime scene... ...on this tiny picture frame. The defense has indicated the possibility of a yellow envelope. An envelope that left the scene of the crime with the poisoned stamp on it. Klavier: Yes, but even if this envelope contained a poisoned stamp... ...and Drew Misham, knowing this, put it in a frame... ...he never would have used that stamp! Judge: ...I'm afraid you're right. Which means there is a fatal flaw in the defense's case! Apollo: (I haven't been on the wrong track this whole time, I'm sure of it! The traces of atroquinine, the envelope, the frame... ...and Drew Misham's mysterious death... They're all connected somehow!) Judge: Well, Mr. Justice, do you have a conclusion for us? Apollo: ...The defense stands by its case, Your Honor. We've seen that the logical outcome of the evidence makes no sense. Which means that one of our clues... must be a fake. Klavier: Ah, a fake clue? Fascinating! And if we find this fake, your wild fantasies will prove quite reasonable, ja? Apollo: The fake clue that's thrown us off the poison's trail is none other than... the red envelope. Judge: This red envelope... is a fake? Apollo: ...Without a doubt, Your Honor. Klavier: Klavier: ...Wasn't it you who presented this evidence to the court? Apollo: ...Oh. Trucy: Hold on a second, Apollo! The poison on that envelope, the frame, and the coffee mug... They're all connected somehow! Apollo: Oh... right! (*sigh* I can hear it already. \"It looks like the fake... was you, Herr Forehead!\") Trucy: Now's no time for wallowing in self-pity! Let's get thinking, Apollo! Leads back to: \"The fake clue that's thrown us off the poison's trail is none other than...\" the frame. Judge: This frame... is the \"fake\" clue? Apollo: ...Without a doubt, Your Honor. Klavier: Klavier: ...Wasn't it you who presented this evidence to the court? Apollo: ...Oh. Trucy: Hold on a second, Apollo! The poison on that envelope, the frame, and the coffee mug... They're all connected somehow! Apollo: Oh... right! (*sigh* I can hear it already. \"It looks like the fake... was you, Herr Forehead!\") Trucy: We can flog ourselves later, Apollo! Now's the time for thinking! Leads back to: \"The fake clue that's thrown us off the poison's trail is none other than...\" Drew Misham. Leads to: \"Th-the victim was a \"fake clue\"? I'm afraid I don't understand.\" Judge: Th-the victim was a \"fake clue\"? I'm afraid I don't understand. Apollo: ...I'll explain. We have an envelope, a frame, and a mug, linked by poison. That all makes sense. What doesn't make sense is the victim himself! Klavier: Klavier: ...Congratulations. You've completely lost me. So the fake evidence is none other than the master of fake himself, the forger? ...It makes a good story, I'll give you that. Apollo: (The fake clue... Fakes... forgeries...) Ah...! Trucy: I know that face! That's the \"I just had an idea\" face! Apollo: I don't know if I'm right... but I'm going with it anyway! What if our \"forger\" is the \"fake\"!? Klavier: ...Come again? Apollo: Seven years ago, our forger sniffed a trap, and stepped aside. ...Seven years passed. Now the forger stumbles into that very same trap, and dies. ...Why? Judge: That's what I want to know! Apollo: Because the forger who was killed... was a fake. Klavier: Here we are again. The victim... was a \"fake\"? Apollo: One forger smelled the trap. One forger fell into the trap. That's two forgers! And one of them was a fake! Judge: Order! Order! Order!!! Klavier: So you are telling us that Drew Misham, the victim, was a fake? Well, if he was the fake, who was the real forger? You'd better not be claiming there was some kind of switcheroo? Judge: ...I'm afraid you're going to have to back up your story. Mr. Justice. Show us just who the real Drew Misham was! Apollo: (If Drew Misham wasn't the real forger... ...there's only one other person it could have been!) ...Understood, Your Honor. Forger Drew Misham was himself a forgery! The real forger was...! Present Vera Misham profile Apollo: Leads to: \"There can be only one explanation, really.\" Present anyone else Apollo: Judge: ...... Klavier: ...... Brushel: ...... Apollo: (Ack! \"Attorney Makes Wild Claim, Becomes Subject Of Mass Ridicule\"... end quote! Better come up with something quick before that story goes to print...!) Leads back to: \"Forger Drew Misham was himself a forgery!\" Apollo: There can be only one explanation, really. The real identity of the forger known as Drew Misham is none other than... ...his only daughter, Vera Misham! Judge: Order! Order! Order! ...Mr. Justice! This is going out on a limb, even for you! Trucy: I kinda agree. I mean, Vera, a forger? Apollo: Let's consider it before you write it off entirely. If you look at the paintings in the studio, one fact becomes quite clear. Forgery had been taking place in that studio for quite some time! The forger wasn't caught in that trap seven years ago. This can only mean that the one who was caught in the trap wasn't the forger! Judge: Well... Actually, that does make a certain kind of sense. Apollo: One more thing! Only two sets of fingerprints were found in the forger's studio. Drew Misham's... and Vera Misham's. Klavier: ...... Apollo: If we know that Drew Misham wasn't the forger... ...that leaves only one possibility, by process of elimination. The forger was Vera Misham. ...Well? Klavier: ...... ...Fascinating! Judge: Vera Misham...? Vera: ...... Judge: You've been paying attention to the trial so far? Vera: ...... Klavier: Let's just ask her and be done with it, shall we? Who are you? Who is the forger, Drew Misham? Vera: ...... ...! ...... Apollo: (Was that... an expression of emotion I saw on her face? She's staring holes into Prosecutor Gavin's face...) Klavier: ...I'm used to being stared at by Fr\u00e4uleins, believe me. Though they usually talk to me, too. Tell us. Were you the one who forged those works of art? Vera: ...... ...Yes... Apollo: ...! Judge: So... so the forger, Drew Misham was... you!? Vera: ...... ...Yes, it was me... Judge: Wha... Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? Apollo: (The court was in an uproar, and it wasn't coming down. We had to break for a ten minute recess.) To be continued. October 8, 1:24 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 6 Trucy: OK... So where exactly does this leave us, Apollo? Apollo: Well, the Drew Misham who was killed... ...wasn't \"Drew Misham the forger\", basically. Trucy: Huh? Well then, who was he? Apollo: Well \"he\" was actually... Vera: ...... Apollo: (...Doing her nails.) So, you really made those forgeries? Vera: ...... ...Yes... For Father... ...I know it was wrong... Trucy: Could you tell us how it happened? Vera: ...... ...My father was a painter... ...I love painting ever since I was a child... ...One day, Father saw it in me... ...He saw that I had the \"talent\"... Trucy: The talent... for making forgeries? Vera: ...How should I say it? It was not only paintings I made... ...Given the materials, I could make... anything... Apollo: Anything...? Vera: ...Father was so proud, and I, so happy... ...But, in the end, I was making... those... Apollo: ...Forgeries. Vera: ...I've never had a good constitution, nor... personality... ...I know very little of the world outside my door... ...... ...Now, because of me... Father... is... Trucy: ...Do you know about this red envelope? Vera: ...I remember that envelope. It was some time ago... Apollo: So, you were already a, um... You were already creating your \"works\" back then? Vera: ...I started when I was only twelve years old... Apollo: So the one who figured out the stamp was poisoned, that was... Bailiff: ...Mr. Justice! It's time! To the courtroom, please! Apollo: R-Right! (Out of time...) Trucy: Wait, Vera! Just one more thing, please! Those three paintings in the studio... Vera: ...I painted those, as part of my work... Trucy: Right. See, we checked them out and we saw what was underneath. We saw the rough sketches underneath the three finished paintings... Vera: ...I see... ...... ...Mr. Justice... Apollo: ...Yes!? Vera: ...Father... He knew of you... ...Of both of you... Apollo: Your late father...? Vera: ...He was watching, gathering information... ...All about the \"Wright & Co. Law Offices\"... Trucy: B-But lately, we're not doing just law...! Vera: ...Yes... You do tricks, gags to amuse... and play piano... Trucy: Well, they're not really \"gags\"... Vera: ...Yet when Father heard you had resumed the legal business... ...How pleased he was... Trucy: ...Who was Mr. Misham? Apollo: ...How'm I supposed to know? Trucy: What if he was Daddy's Daddy? Apollo: Judging from the relative ages involved, I'd say it's highly unlikely. (Things are already confusing enough with all these daddies running around. We know that the victim's daughter, Vera, was the forger. What does this mean for the case...? Guess we're about to find out.) October 8, 1:36 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom, No. 3 Judge: Court is now back in session. Vera: ...... Apollo: (Vera seems pretty tense. She's practically chewing her fingernails clean off!) Klavier: Perhaps you could begin by telling us how it all worked. How did you set up this \"Drew Misham forger\" persona? Vera: ...... ...... Apollo: (There's that stare again... She's drilling more holes into his head.) Trucy: I know it's hard for you, but hey, he's a handsome guy. Apollo: What's \"hard\"!? Judge: Very well, miss, if you would... ...did you really make those detestable forgeries...? Vera: ...! Klavier: Perhaps you'd rather answer my question? Were you the one who painted that painting. The remarkably similar one? Vera: ...Ah... Yes... ...I painted it, yes... ...Father praised me quite highly for it... Judge: So... she was the one who made the forgeries. Klavier: Yet, she did not wish to reveal the truth of their operation. So the victim was a stand-in, a decoy. To the world at large, he was the forger, not her. Vera: ...... ...I've done... a bad thing. I have, haven't I...? Klavier: Regardless, we need a little more information. About, for instance... ...this! Apollo: ...! Klavier: ...You have seen this before, ja? Vera: ...Y-Yes... It was in the desk drawer... Judge: Very well, you may proceed with your testimony. Tell us everything you know about this envelope. Witness Testimony -- The Red Envelope -- Vera: ...I created things and Father sold them... ...This envelope came after my first work... that was other than a painting... ...Father handled the deal, all of it... ...I received the stamp that was in that envelope... ...It was after that job that we moved to the current studio... Judge: Hmm... There certainly was much of great interest in your testimony. Klavier: ...Not that the witness realizes it. Judge: Very well, please begin the cross-examination! Apollo: Right! OK!

Vera: ...My first painting sold when I was twelve... Apollo: ...Your Honor! She had no idea what she was doing was illegal! Klavier: Klavier: ...Easy there, little attorney.

Got to try and relax.) Ah, good morning, Mr. Enigmar.Enigmar: I'm... sorry to have sprung this on you so suddenly.Phoenix: I received the files from your previous attorney only yesterday.

The victim was a patient, asleep in a hospital bed. The killer comes in, puts a pistol to his forehead, and bam. Lights out. ...Them's the facts.Judge: Hmm... Not so long ago, the victim, Magnifi Gramarye was a famous man. He had the entire country under his \"magical spell\", as it were.Klavier: Ah yes, the great magician. He retired years ago, though. Say the name \"Magnifi\" to one of my generation... and you'd be lucky to get a blank stare.Judge: Yes, though I'm sure the youngsters today know his disciples even better. I daresay Troupe Gramarye has made quite a name for themselves.Gumshoe: Anyhow, the retired Magnifi's been in the hospital for the last year. Hmm, what was it? A mall-ignorant tutor or something. Doing something to his liver, I think. Yeah.Judge: A \"malignant tumor\", perhaps?Klavier: In other words, he had liver cancer. He had only three months left to live, in fact.Magnifi's Chart added to the Court Record.Judge: Hmm... The facts do seem simple enough. But... something's not right.Klavier: ...The victim was already climbing a three-month stairway to heaven. ...Why not wait for him to knock-knock-knock on heaven's door? Why shoot him?Phoenix: (I wouldn't have put it quite so lyrically, but it's true. Why make the effort to commit murder when the victim was about to die?)Gumshoe: Incidentally, the victim had a serious case of diabetes.Phoenix: Diabetes?Klavier: In fact, he was about to \"shoot up\" with insulin... ...when he was shot with a pistol. The syringe was found at the crime scene. Chronic diabetes... and cancer. As much as it pains me to say it... ...the victim was clearly at the end of his life.Small Syringe added to the Court Record.Examine evidence Small Syringe Syringe barrel Phoenix: ...I always hated getting shots. I guess Magnifi was giving himself the insulin shots... There's no way I could do that... *shudder* ...! Wait! If Magnifi used this to inject his insulin... ...why are there no traces of it having been used? Hmm... Something to keep in mind.Judge: Hmm... I believe the question before us is clear, then. Why did the killer have to shoot this dying man? What reason could he have had?Klavier: ...Very well, Detective. Perhaps you can enlighten us as to the circumstances of the shooting.Gumshoe: Y-Yes, sir!Witness Testimony-- The Circumstances --Gumshoe: Actually... the victim kind of ordered the defendant to do him in. A few days before it happened, the victim sent a letter \"ordering\" his own murder. The defendant did what was asked of him, and shot the old man in the forehead! The bullet was fired from the pistol found at the scene, no doubt about it. And the pistol definitely belonged to the old man, sir!Judge: Wh-Whaaat!? You're saying the victim ordered his own shooting?Klavier: Those are the facts. I have here the letter in question.Magnifi's Letter added to the Court Record.Judge: ...Very unusual, indeed! Although, could such a thing as a letter really cause one to pull a trigger, I wonder?Klavier: I believe the answer to that question can be found at the end of the letter.Judge: Ah... \"You cannot refuse, and we both know the reason why.\" Detective Gumshoe, can you explain this to the court?Gumshoe: Unfortunately, even the defendant won't say a peep about that bit, sir.Phoenix: One thing bothers me about this. Why didn't he just say \"11\"? Why have him come at \"11:05\" without some specific reason...?Klavier: The devil is in the details, Herr Attorney...Judge: Well? Was there some reason?Klavier: As it turns out, there was. Every night, for a half hour, starting at 11:00... ...the victim, Magnifi Gramarye, was given an IV.Phoenix: An IV...?Judge: There it is in the picture, off to the side of the bed.Klavier: At 11:00, a doctor would come to set up the IV. Thirty minutes later, he would come back for the empty bag. This happened every night, without fail.Phoenix: So that was the only time they could meet without the chance of an untimely interruption. ...During his IV.Judge: Very well, shall we begin? ...Mr. Wright, your cross-examination, if you would!Phoenix: (What's this \"reason he couldn't refuse\", I wonder? He could have at least mentioned it to me...)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Circumstances --Gumshoe: Actually... the victim kind of ordered the defendant to do him in.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Just because he got the letter doesn't mean he went through with it! Klavier: Oh? I disagree. The victim was, indeed, shot in the forehead, after all. Just as he had commanded. Phoenix: It could be a set-up. But let's not be in such a hurry. Maybe we should let the witness talk for a change. Gumshoe: ...Thanks, pal. Klavier: ...... Fine. I can play it slow as well as I can play it fast. On with the testimony, Detective Gumshoe.Gumshoe: A few days before it happened, the victim sent a letter \"ordering\" his own murder.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: ...And this letter was sent by the victim? Gumshoe: There it is! Gotcha! You're all mine this time, pal. Phoenix: ...Huh? Gumshoe: I had the handwriting checked out, of course. It's the victim's, no mistake! Phoenix: Ah, I see... Gumshoe: Ha ha ha ha ha! Score one for the boys! Phoenix: (I didn't \"lose\". I was just ascertaining the facts. ...So why am I so annoyed?) Judge: But... a letter ordering your own death? Things aren't what they used to be, I guess. Phoenix: I'm not sure this is exactly \"commonplace\", even now, Your Honor. Gumshoe: ...So anyway, guess I'll keep going while I'm ahead!Gumshoe: The defendant did what was asked of him, and shot the old man in the forehead!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: ...How can you be so sure!? Gumshoe: Hey, you gotta learn to stop relying on people to do your thinking for you, pal. Learn to think for yourself! Get that noggin cranking! Phoenix: (You fail to grasp the concept of \"questioning\", detective.) Gumshoe: First, we got this letter. It says \"shoot... in the forehead\" loud and clear. Phoenix: I can see that. But I still wouldn't do it. Gumshoe: Well, maybe you need to grow yourself a backbone, pal. Phoenix: (You fail to grasp the concept of \"shooting people is bad\", detective.) Gumshoe: We also found the defendant's pistol at the scene. Klavier: Traces of gunpowder residue shows that it had been fired recently. Judge: ...Well, Mr. Wright? As far as I can tell from looking at this photo... ...there seems to be no issue with the prosecution's claim. Phoenix: (The photo... Maybe there's something in there I can use. So they're saying the defendant \"shot the victim in the forehead\"? I think there's a hole in the prosecution's argument! Clearly, Mr. Enigmar...) I have no clue. Phoenix: Unfortunately, nothing in this picture suggests he didn't do it. Judge: Ah, I see. That is unfortunate. Phoenix: ...Huh? Klavier: Well, let's pay it no mind and carry on, shall we? I like a fast tempo. Phoenix: ...Huh? Gumshoe: Hey, I still got stuff to talk about, pal! Phoenix: (...Everyone's so eager to move on. So of course, I want to slow down. ...Is there really not a single clue in this picture?) Judge: Back to the testimony, if you would, detective. Leads back to cross-examination didn't pull the trigger. Phoenix: People don't normally commit murder just because their teacher told them to. Which means the defendant didn't fire that pistol! Klavier: Klavier: ...This is your position, then? Phoenix: Um, well, yes. Klavier: This is the sort of occasion when my brother would present some \"evidence\". Phoenix: ...Ah. Klavier: Did you have some evidence you wanted to show us? Something proving it wasn't the defendant who shot the old man? Phoenix: ...... ...... Judge: Penalty for excessive perspiration, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (But it's a cold sweat, Your Honor...) Leads back to cross-examination shot something else. Phoenix: Looking at this photo, another possibility occurs to me. Judge: Yes...? Phoenix: What does the letter tell us? That the defendant had a \"reason he couldn't refuse\" his teacher's wishes. Gumshoe: Bingo, pal! That's why the defendant popped him one in the forehead! Phoenix: Oh? The defense disagrees. You see, the defendant had another choice he could make. Klavier: Klavier: What, and you can prove that with this photo!? Phoenix: ...I can prove he had a choice, yes. Judge: \"The defendant might have fired, like he was ordered. But he didn't shoot the victim's forehead.\" Well, let's hear what you're thinking, Mr. Wright. If he didn't shoot the victim's forehead, what did the defendant shoot? Present clown doll's forehead Phoenix: Judge: The clown doll...? Phoenix: Take a closer look. See? It's been shot in the forehead, too. Judge: Ah...! There's a hole in its forehead! Phoenix: Yes, and a hole in the prosecution's claim! Klavier: Klavier: Hah! And I suppose you have a reason as to why he'd shoot the clown doll? Phoenix: He didn't just shoot the doll. He shot the doll's forehead. Klavier: His \"forehead\"...? Aah...! Phoenix: Let's read the \"orders\" once more, shall we? \"...You will shoot, one shot, square in the forehead.\" ...Which is exactly what he did. He shot the clown doll square in the forehead! Judge: The defense has raised an intriguing possibility. That hole in the clown's forehead... It definitely looks like it was shot! Bailiff! Send someone to investigate this matter! Klavier: Klavier: I admit, I'm impressed. But I expected nothing less. Still, this doesn't mean he didn't shoot the victim! Phoenix: Phoenix: Perhaps he did have to shoot a forehead, as ordered. But the letter says nothing about whose forehead... This was the only way he had to follow his orders without taking a life! Judge: Hmm. The bullet hole in the clown doll's forehead does demand an explanation. It might very well be a clue. Yet Prosecutor Gavin is right. It alone does not prove the defendant's innocence. You cannot say for sure the defendant didn't shoot the victim. Klavier: So sorry, Mr. Wright. How sad it is to see the mighty fall. Phoenix: (...How sad it is to see the novice's overconfidence. He doesn't realize just how big this little \"hole\" is going to get.) Judge: ...Detective Gumshoe. Please take this new-found fact into account as you continue your testimony. Adds statement \"So what if he shot the clown? He still shot the victim, pal!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Judge: Ah... I see! Which is to say... ...I have no idea what you're talking about. Prosecutor Gavin? Klavier: The defendant had a choice other than shooting the victim in the forehead? ...Perhaps I might suggest one. He could have shot this attorney in the forehead! Phoenix: ...Urk! Judge: Ah... I see. Which is to say... ...I still don't see. Still, when in doubt, give a penalty, I always say. Phoenix: (Ugh. Time to think this one through again.) Leads back to cross-examinationPress (after adding statement) Phoenix: Phoenix: But... it might have been the clown's forehead he shot. Gumshoe: OK, so he practiced first on the doll, then shot him! Phoenix: He \"practiced\" in the middle of the hospital? Anyone could have come in at any moment! Gumshoe: Yeah, but no one did come, did they, pal? Besides, it's what I woulda done. \"Always look before you shoot,\" I say. Klavier: ...Might I suggest we move on? This is getting us nowhere. Phoenix: (Patience. We'll get there sooner than you think.) Judge: Very well. Please continue with your testimony, detective.Gumshoe: The bullet was fired from the pistol found at the scene, no doubt about it.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You mean this pistol, the one in the crime scene photo? Gumshoe: ...That's the one! It's a funny-looking gun so there's no mistaking it. Klavier: We compared the bullet taken from the victim's skull with a bullet fired from this gun. The rifling marks on the bullets were a perfect match. Phoenix: So... you verified the murder weapon, in other words. Gumshoe: You bet we did!Press (after pressing fifth statement, before Stage Pistol is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: Phoenix: You mean this pistol, the one in the crime scene photo? Gumshoe: ...That's the one! It's a funny-looking gun so there's no mistaking it. Klavier: We compared the bullet taken from the victim's skull with a bullet fired from this gun. The rifling marks on the bullets were a perfect match. Phoenix: So... you verified the murder weapon, in other words. Gumshoe: You bet we did! Judge: ...The court would like to see the pistol in question. Gumshoe: You got it, sir! Here she is! Judge: Well. This truly is a \"blast\" from the past. Gumshoe: It's a stage pistol for magic shows, see. But it can fire real bullets. Judge: Hmm. It looks so much bigger in real life than on TV. Gumshoe: Yeah, but it can only hold one round. ...By the way, the pistol's firing chamber is empty. ...And it shows traces of having been fired recently. Phoenix: So... were any fingerprints found on the gun? Klavier: ...Unfortunately, no. Of course, the defendant is known for wearing gloves. We might say that a lack of fingerprints is, in fact, a \"fingerprint\" of its own. Judge: Ah ha! Intriguing point, well made! Phoenix: Whoa whoa whoa! Not well made! Not intriguing! Judge: In any case, the court accepts this evidence. Stage Pistol added to the Court Record. Judge: ...My grandchild would get a kick out of seeing this. ...But now it's time to return to our testimony.Examine evidence Stage Pistol Chamber Phoenix: If you look closely, you can see how the pistol's made to bend here. It's a one-shot model, and I guess this bend is where you load it. So... this is the famous Gramarye Golden Sun. They say kids used to love pretending they had one of those. I wonder if they pretended to miss their targets, too?Gumshoe: And the pistol definitely belonged to the old man, sir!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: ...Why are you so certain? Gumshoe: What pile of sand has your head been stuck in all this time, pal? You never heard of \"Zak & Valant's Quick-Draw Shootem\"? Phoenix: Huh? What's that? Gumshoe: One of the defendant's specialties. Zak and Valant stand on either side of a girl! Then, they shoot! But the bullets don't hit her! Instead, they hit everything else on stage!!! This was one of the pistols they used in their show. Got a great design, huh? The kids love it. Klavier: Many boys and girls joined the police because of that pistol, I hear. Phoenix: (You know, that would explain a lot about the police force.) Gumshoe: Troupe Gramarye stopped doing that act a while ago. The old man held on to that pistol ever since.Press (after pressing fourth statement, before Stage Pistol is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: Phoenix: ...Why are you so certain?

Phoenix: (More of a confirmation than a summary, but whatever.) Klavier: That was really more of a confirmation than a summary. But our defense attorney seems pleased enough with himself.

    "cot": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided a lengthy transcript from the \"Turnabout Succession\" case, along with a list of characters, evidence, and testimonies. The task is to identify which evidence and testimony contradict each other.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The testimonies are from the trial of Shadi Enigmar (Zak Gramarye), accused of murdering Magnifi Gramarye. The key testimonies given by Detective Gumshoe are about the circumstances of the murder, specifically that Zak followed a letter's order to shoot Magnifi in the forehead using a specific pistol.\n\nLooking at the evidence, there's a \"Stage Pistol\" (Evidence 20) which is the supposed murder weapon. The testimony in question is Testimony 3: \"The bullet was fired from the pistol found at the scene, no doubt about it.\" However, during the cross-examination, Phoenix points out that the pistol's chamber is empty and shows traces of being fired, but the bullet in the victim's forehead might have come from a different source. The contradiction arises because the stage pistol, which is a one-shot gun, was used in the magic act, and the clown doll's forehead also had a bullet hole. This implies that the pistol could have been fired at the doll instead of the victim, challenging the testimony that the bullet from this specific pistol killed Magnifi.\n\nTherefore, the evidence \"Stage Pistol\" (20) contradicts Testimony 3 because the pistol's use on the doll introduces doubt that it was the actual murder weapon used on Magnifi."

Blackquill: I went because I had received an invitation from Master Toneido. Here, see for yourself. It was a special show commemorating his junior disciple Uendo's promotion. It was also an occasion to announce the boy's succession to the stage name of \"Uendo II.\" Athena: Um, so what exactly does it mean to \"succeed to a stage name\"? Blackquill: Hmph. You really don't know, do you? In the performing arts, a name succession is when an artist inherits a predecessor's name. Athena: I see. So there was another \"Uendo\" rakugo artist before, and this disciple succeeded him, huh. And what did your invitation say? Blackquill: It contained a simple letter of salutations, and an outline of the show's program. Judge: ...Oh! It appears Taifu Toneido was going to perform \"Tokisoba,\" or \"Time Soba.\" He's famous for his masterful pantomime of eating soba, using only his fan as a prop. And Uendo was to peform \"Soba Sei,\" or \"Soba Glutton.\" A soba-themed show, I see! Blackquill: It seems you know a thing or two about rakugo yourself, Your Baldness. The first to perform was the senior disciple, Geiru, followed by Uendo... ...and, lastly, Master Toneido. Invitation added to Court Record. Athena: I see. So that's why you happened to be at the storytellers' theater yesterday. So what happened after you arrived?Press (subsequent times) Athena: Athena: Prosecutor Blackquill, what did you go to the theater for in the first place? Blackquill: I went because I had received an invitation from Master Toneido. Here, see for yourself. It was a special show commemorating his junior disciple Uendo's promotion. It was also an occasion to announce the boy's succession to the stage name of \"Uendo II.\" Athena: Um, so what exactly does it mean to \"succeed to a stage name\"? Blackquill: Hmph.

The first to perform was the senior disciple, Geiru, followed by Uendo... ...and, lastly, Master Toneido. Athena: I see. So that's why you happened to be at the storytellers' theater yesterday. So what happened after you arrived?Blackquill: I went straight to Master Toneido's dressing room to say hello.Press Athena: Athena: And how did Master Toneido appear when you said hello to him? Blackquill: I went with the intention of greeting him, but ultimately, we didn't actually meet. Athena: Y-You didn't see him? Why not? Blackquill: Geiru escorted me to the dressing room... ...but we heard the sound of rakugo being performed from within. Thinking the master was rehearsing, we decided to wait in the hall until he was done. Athena: You heard rakugo being performed in the dressing room? Blackquill: Yes. Not just me, but Geiru as well. Nahyuta: In other words, you can confirm that the victim was still alive at around 4 PM? Blackquill: Correct. I couldn't hear him clearly through the doors, but I'm sure it was Master Toneido. I could tell because it was the \"Time Soba\" routine being performed in there. Athena: (Hmm... So that means the victim was killed sometime after that...)Blackquill: Bucky went into the dressing room thereafter, only to come storming out a while later.Press Athena: Athena: Please tell us in detail how Mr. Whet appeared at the time. Blackquill: Geriu and I were waiting in the hallway for Master Toneido to finish practicing... when Bucky appeared and entered the dressing room with his things. Athena: What happened after that? Blackquill: We heard what sounded like Bucky shouting inside the room. About ten minutes later, Bucky came back out of the dressing room looking rather irate. Nahyura: This is most likely when the murder was committed. The victim was an elderly man. It would've been entirely possible to kill within the span of ten minutes. Athena: (Arngh...! I'd better come up with some kind of counterargument, and fast!)Blackquill: Master Toneido's junior disciple, Uendo, apparently then entered the room soon after.Press Athena: Athena: What do you mean by \"apparently\"? Didn't you see him go in? Blackquill: No, I couldn't. I wasn't able to see the dressing room door from where I was standing at the time. But Geiru was right in front of it, so I'm sure she saw it all. Athena: I-I see. And why do you suppose Uendo went to the dressing room anyway? Blackquill: He had just finished his routine, so he was making a courtesy call. A disciple is to pay their master respect tight before and after each performance. Athena: And all disciples are expected to do this? Blackquill: Yes, it's common courtesy among rakugo artists. Athena: I see. Could you tell us what happened after Uendo went into the dressing room? Blackquill: Certainly.Blackquill: That's when Uendo discovered Master Toneido's body.Press Athena: Athena: And how did Uendo act at the time? Blackquill: After Uendo had been in the dressing for two or three minutes... ...we heard a scream from inside the room, and Uendo came flying out. Athena: Did you hear any signs of a struggle at that time? Blackquill: No, just Uendo's woeful scream. Athena: I-I see...Athena: (Simon has no reason to lie, but I also don't have much to go on. I'd better ask all the questions I can.)After pressing all statements:Judge: Hmm... Well done, Prosecutor Blackquill. Your testimony has given us quite a glimpse into the sequence of events.Nahyuta: Thank you, Prosecutor Blackquill. And now, please allow me to summairze your testimony. While Prosecutor Blackquill and Geiru were in the hallway waiting for Master Toneido... ...the accused came along and entered the dressing room with some items in tow. He was heard shouting for a time inside the dressing room. About ten minutes later, he came back out of the room, seeming rather angry. A short time after the accused had come and gone, Uendo Toneido went into the room. A few minutes later, after having discovered the victim's body, Uendo gave a scream... ...and came running out into the hallway from within. Prosecutor Blackquill and Geiru then ran into the room and saw the body for themselves. From the circumstances, it is quite clear that the accused murdered the victim.Judge: Hmm... This is crucial testimony indeed.Simon's Statement added to the Court Record.Nahyuta: Defense. An eyewitness has given conclusive testimony. Why not let it all go now, and allow the victim his last rites?Athena: Not on your life! If Uendo went into the dressing, too, and was the first to discover the body... then who's to say HE didn't commit the crime!Nahyuta: Uendo was in the dressing room for a mere two, perhaps three minutes. He could not have possibly committed the murder in that time, nor without making any noise.Athena: (Ooh, Simon! Why did you have to give that awful testimony!) Prosecutor Blackquill! Can't you give me something a little better to work with here?!Blackquill: Isn't it up to you to ask the right questions? I am certainly willing to tell you all that I know. So, if you are truly capable as you claim, then draw out what you need yourself!Athena: This is no time for your twisted games, Prosecutor Blackquill! Just admit that you don't remember it all that well!Nahyuta:Nahyuta: Prosecutor Blackquill... Watching you collude with the defense like this, I see that you are no prosecutor. Be gone, witness! You shall haunt this sacred hall no more!Blackquill: Hmph. How dare you treat me like some evil spirit to be exorcised. I'll remember this, you blackguard...Athena: Don't worry, Prosecutor Blackquill. I've got this!Nahyuta: Would I have my way, he would not be the only one here to step down... you half-boiled, putrid egg yolk!Athena: (Eww... I object to the notion that I'm a gooey, smelly mess!)Nahyuta: Prosecutor Blackquill's testimony was like the lowly opening act of a rakugo show. He may hold the title \"prosecutor,\" but this time, he stood on the side of the defense. To restore balance to this trial, I would like to present an actual witness for the prosecution.Judge: And who is this witness?Nahyuta: The person who was with Prosecutor Blackquill when the body was discovered. She is another entertainer of the Toneido School: Ms. Geiru Toneido.Judge: Please state your name and occupation, witness.Geiru: Hello, everyone! I'm here to represent the Toneido School with a twisty, twist, twiiist! And BLOOOON! There you have it! A stunning balloon hat! It's me! The balloon artist you all know and love, Geeeiru Toneidoooo! Just call me Geiru, sweetie! One, two... BLOOOON!Judge: Wh-What a way to capture your audience's attention! I daresay I can't take my eyes off those balloons!Athena: Please tell me you're talking about the hat, Your Honor...Geiru: Oh Mister Judgey! I'm so glad you liked my performance! Would you consider joining my fan club? Pwetty pwease?Judge: Oh, absolutely!Athena: And please save your fanboying for after the trial, Your Honor... Anyway, Geiru... I can't help but notice, you seem awfully cheerful for having just lost your master.Geiru: Of course I'm sad... But Shisho would scold me if I didn't put on a big smile. Never show sadness! Smile, smile, smile! With a twisty, twist, twiiist! And BLOOOON! There you have it! One gorgeous cake!Athena: I-I see. I guess an entertainer's gotta do what an entertain's gotta do... (Her balloon art's worse than a Rorschach test. All I saw was a severed monster head...) Geiru, you're obviously a balloon artist. So how did you come to be a member of a rakugo school?Geiru: Well, my father -- my late father, that is -- was a rakugo artist, you see... So I joined the Toneido School to be just like my daddy someday!Athena: I see.Geiru: My father and I owe so much to Shisho, our master! But that Bucky Whet... Oooooh, how could he?! I want to see him pay for what he's done as quickly as possible!Judge: Your distress is entirely understandable. And my condolences for your loss.Geiru: And, and, not only that, but he...Athena: Y-You have more to say about Mr. Whet?Geiru: Every time he comes to deliver soba to us, he yells at me! He always tells me to \"get away!\"Athena: Is there any reason why he would say such a thing to you?Geiru: He says the smell of my perfume will get into his soba and ruin it! Like, how can he say that?! This is a greaaaat scent!Judge: Hmph! How very rude of him. I don't blame you for being upset.Athena: Excuse me, Your Honor! But please don't let Geiru's \"balloons\" bias your judgement! Mr. Whet hasn't been proven guilty yet, remember?!Nahyuta: Hmph. It will be interesting to see how long that fire of yours will last, defense. Now, then, Geiru. Please share the truth with this court.Judge: Yes, Geiru. Your testimony please.Witness Testimony-- Before the Murder Was Discovered --Geiru: From 4 PM to a little after 4:20 PM, when Shisho's body was found... ...Simon and I were standing in the hallway in front of the dressing room. Before Uendo discovered the body, the only person who had gone in there was Bucky. Come to think of it, a little while before Bucky showed up, Jugemu was barking like mad!Nahyuta: Prosecutor Blackquill, do you have any objections to this witnesses's testimony?Blackquill: ........No. Tsk! Make up your bloody mind, Sad Monk Sahdmadhi. First you exorcise me, now this.Nahyuta: Hmph. You only do as you are instructed by this humble servant of the Holy Mother. As there are no objections, Your Honor, let us move on to the salvation of the victim's soul.Athena:Athena: Hey! I'M the defense attorney here, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi! And I might have an objection or two once I ACTUALLY cross-examine the witness! So what are you asking Prosecutor Blackquill for?! I'M the one you should be checking with!Nahyuta: There is a passage in the sacred scriptures of Khura'inism. \"To stir the wind is beyond the power of a spring chick.\" In other words, the inexperienced are useless. With that in mind, it seemed more judicious to consult with Prosecutor Blackquill.Blackquill: Ha ha ha! He doesn't even see you as an adversary, Cykes-dono!Athena: Well, I won't let either one of you insult me! I'll show you I'm no inexperienced \"spring chick\"! Your Honor! I'm ready to cross-examine the witness!Judge: Hmm... I hope you can make Prosecutor Sahdmadhi see you as a worthy adversary, Ms. Cykes. I'll allow your cross-examination, so you'd better strike while the iron is hot!Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Before the Murder Was Discovered --Geiru: From 4 PM to a little after 4:20 PM, when Shisho's body was found...Press Athena: Athena: So the murder must've happened sometime in those twenty minutes, correct? But twenty minutes isn't a lot of time, is it? Geiru: I don't know... I mean, what do you want me to saaay? That's what happened, y'know? Isn't that right, Simon? Blackquill: Yes. Geiru and I can both confirm that Master Toneido still lived at around 4 PM. Athena: Oh, yeah... You can, can't you? Geiru: Seeeee!Geiru: ...Simon and I were standing in the hallway in front of the dressing room.Press Athena: Athena: The fact that the two of you were there in front of the dressing room... ...means you were able to see everyone who went in and out, right? Geiru: Of course! O-Or are you insinuating... ...that I was daydreaming or sleeping while standing up or something? Athena: No, of course not... Geiru: I saw everything, I tell you! Athena: F-Fine. (So you say, anyway. But did you really?)Geiru: Before Uendo discovered the body, the only person who had gone in there was Bucky.Press Athena: Athena: Only the defendant and Uendo entered around the time of the murder? Geiru: That's right! That's why it must've been Bucky who... who killed poor Shishooo...! Athena: Um, let's take a deep breath, okay, Geiru? So not a single person set foot into the dressing room during that time? Geiru: I already told you over and over, didn't I? There was nobody else. Nahyuta: I must apologize on the lawyer's behalf. Even her memory is that of a spring chick's. Please overlook her transgression as best you can. Geriu: Oh, I see... Poor thing! Hang in there, sweetie! Athena: (Hey! Who are you calling a birdbrain, buddy!)Geiru: Come to think of it, a little while before Bucky showed up, Jugemu was barking like mad!Press Athena: Athena: \"Jugemu\"? Geiru: Thats my doggie! I keep him at the theater. Let's see... With a twisty, twist, twiiist! And BLOOOON! There you have it! My cute widdle Judgemu! Athena: He's... kinda creepy looking... Geiru: Oh, but he's a really, really good boy! Athena: A-And why was Jugemu barking? Do you think it's because he saw someone suspicious? If so, then we'd have a new suspect in this case. Geiru: Hmm... Now, why was he barking again...? Oh, I remember! Because it was time for me to feed him! So I went into his yard and gave him some food. Athena:  Couldn't somebody have slipped into the dressing room while you were doing that? Geiru: Nope, the door out into the yard was wiiide open. I would've seen if anybody went into the dressing room. Athena: Prosecutor Blackquill, come down to the stand for a sec... please! Blackquill: Hmph. How many times must I do this? Athena: You saw what Geiru was talking about, right? So why didn't you mention it before?! Blackquill: Hmph! I can't be expected to remember every minute detail! Athena: Well, remember them now -- please! Did Geiru go out into the yard? Blackquill: Yes. I remember now that she went to feed Jugemu. And I saw her looking towards the dressing room quite frequently as well. Athena: Do you recall anything else? Blackquill: It looked as though she were feeding the dog a great quantity of dumplings or something. Jugemu couldn't finish them all, so he buried the rest in a corner of the yard. That's about all I can remember. Simon's Statement updated in the Court Record. Athena: (Hmm... It looks like Geiru was telling the truth.) Your Honor, I'd like Geiru's last statement added to her testimony. Judge: As you wish, defense. Changes statement from \"Come to think of it, a little while before Bucky showed up, Jugemu was barking like mad!\" to \"I was in the yard, but the door was wide open, so I could keep watch on the dressing room.\"Geiru: I was in the yard, but the door was wide open, so I could keep watch on the dressing room.Press Athena: Athena: You know what this means, right, Geiru? You weren't in the hallway the entire time after all, were you? Geiru: Well, okay, so I did go out into the yard, but it was just for a second. And the yard door was wide open, so I could still see the dressing room the whole time. Athena: (The door was open, so she could still see the dressing room?) Prosecutor Blackquill, I need you on the stand again -- please! Blackquill: What am I, your lady-in-waiting? Athena: Do you remember anything about the time Geiru was in the yard? Blackquill: Simply that Jugemu buried the food he couldn't finish in a corner of the yard. That's about all I can remember. Athena: Thank you. (I didn't really need to her about the dog again, though...) Geiru: When I finished feeding Jugemu, I returned to the hallway. And then, I saw Bucky go into the dressing room! No question about it!Present Backstage Diagram Athena: Leads to: \"So, you were able to keep an eye on the dressing room while you were out in the yard.\"Athena: (Okay, so, around the time of the murder... Geiru and Simon were hanging out just outside the dressing room. Guess I'm going to have to find a flaw in there somehow if I want to get anywhere.)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Simon Blackquill\nDescription: A prosecutor who excels at psychological manipulation.

    "cot": "Okay, I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let me start by reviewing all the given information.\n\nThe key testimonies here are from Geiru. In her fourth testimony, she says she was in the yard but the door was open, so she could keep watch on the dressing room. However, looking at the Backstage Diagram (Evidence 1), the description states that when the yard door is open, it blocks the view from the yard to the dressing room. So if Geiru was in the yard with the door open, she wouldn't actually be able to see the dressing room door. That contradicts her claim that she could keep watch. This means her testimony about being able to monitor the dressing room while in the yard is false because the open door would obstruct her view. Therefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 1 (Backstage Diagram) and Testimony 4."

For her mind to be in turmoil is hardly unexpected.Judge: Yes, it must be very difficult, indeed.Nahyuta: To a disciple, one's master is akin to a real parent. Surely, her shock is immense. The way this lawyer tries to pin the blame on this poor soul at first opportunity... All I can say is... defense attorneys are heartless creatures indeed.Athena: But I wasn't...! That was't what I was trying to do...!Nahyuta: Is it beyond your comprehension, defense? Your unskilled argument is scarring this witness even further. And if we ask the people of this courtroom, I am sure they would agree.Athena: What?! The gallery doesn't get a say in this!Nahyuta: Are you afraid to find out that they think ill of you? Or perhaps you are in the wrong? Listen to them now with that keen sense of hearing you are so proud of.Gallery:He's right. That was harsh. She didn't have to go that far!I feel kind of sorry for the witness... And why is the lawyer's outfit so yellow?Athena: N-No... I was just trying... to find the truth... (Why is the whole gallery siding with Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?)Nahyuta: The people understand... They know what is right, and what is wrong.Gallery:That lawyer's still in training, isn't she? Why is she all by herself?Athena: (I hear the voices of the gallery... I can hear the voices of their hearts...! It's so intense... I feel so alone up here, fighting by myself...)Nahyuta: Are you afraid, child? It is ludicrous to come to a trial with such paltry preparation of the soul! I command you to leave this courtroom at once!Athena: (B-But I can't give up... I have to... I have to... keep pressing on...) As long as there was a moment when nobody was watching the dressing room door... ...the defendant can't be convicted solely on Prosecutor Blackquill and Geiru's testimonies!Nahyuta: Hmph. Even now, you would continue to resist? You are childish in defeat as well, I see.Athena: I'm not out for the count yet, buster! I'm just getting started!Nahyuta: Despite your posturing, is it not true that your resolve could crumble at any moment? With a little push, you would surely succumb to despair. A little push such as with this piece of conclusive evidence.Athena: \"C-conclusive evidence,\" huh?Nahyuta: That is correct. We found a critical piece of evidence at the scene of the crime: The victim's dying message, which clearly implicates the accused, Bucky Whet! Look at these Japanese playing cards -- known as \"karuta\" -- lined up on the table. These special English-version karuta cards spell out a message. That message: \"WHET NO 4.\"Athena: \"WHET NO 4\"...? Y-You mean, \"Whet Noodle No. 4\"?!Nahyuta: Yes, \"Whet Noodle No. 4,\" as the fourth head chef of Whet Soba is also known. The message points to none other than the accused, Bucky Whet!Athena: Noooooooooooo!Judge: Th-That makes perfect sense, doesn't it!Geiru: Wow! Great job, Mr. Prosecutor!Athena: (Oh, no! This is really, really bad! What do I do, what do I do?!)Crime Scene Report updated in the Court Record.Nahyuta: Would you still carry on your futile fight in the face of this irrefutable evidence?Athena: Y-You can say whatever you want, but we won't know until we--Nahyuta:Nahyuta: It is cruel to give the accused false hope. You will only compound his suffering. Wise people of the courtroom, do you not agree?Gallery:He's right. It's cruel to make him suffer when there's conclusive evidence.What an incompetent newb! I feel bad for the victim AND the defendant!Athena: (Wh-What?! But I'm trying to prove Mr. Whet's innocence here!)Nahyuta: I know you can hear them, defense. Their voice implore you to save the accused's soul. It is time for you to let it go, and move on, you inexperienced lawyer. You lack the competence with which to accomplish anything meaningful here!Athena: (I-Is he right? Is this too much for me to handle on my own?)Gallery:What good is she doing anybody? She should just quit right now!Athena: (Grrnngh...)Nahyuta: Now, defense. Leave everything to this humble servant of the Holy Mother.???:Blackquill: He's trying to use your keen sense of hearing against you to manipulate the trial, Athena. What a cheap trick for a supposedly holy man.Athena: S-Simon...!Blackquill: And you fopdoodles in the gallery! Can't a man watch a trial in peace?! This inexperienced amateur is about to turn the trial around!Gallery:Does that prosecutor really think she can turn things around...?Athena: (The mood in this courtroom is starting to change!)Judge: Prosecutor Blackquill! What are you doing at the defense's bench?!Blackquill: Hmph. I grew bored of watching from the gallery. Besides, if I were to leave this trial to this spring chick... ...and lose my favorite soba shop in the process, I will be quite cross.Nahyuta: You voluntarily stand on the side of impurity and sin? Truly, what a fool you are.Blackquill: To think, you were so easily manipulated by his parlor tricks... What happened to \"qualified and capable,\" Athena?Athena: I-I just let my guard down a little bit! But it won't happen again!Blackquill: Hmph. Then gird up your loins, and steel yourself for battle!Athena: I'm not girding up anything in this skirt! But I AM ready to get serious!Nahyuta:Nahyuta: It seems there is now yet another soul I must cast down into hell...Blackquill: I was in prison for a long time. And \"hell\" sounds no worse than \"cell,\" to be honest.Nahyuta: Ah, but the fires of hell will not be the end of your suffering. For the sin you have just committed, you shall surely be reborn as a panda in your next life. A white and black, reverse panda, that is. And you shall be put in a zoo, to be exposed to public ridicule.Athena: A threat like that won't work on Prosecutor Blackquill! After all, he's already used to looking like a panda in THIS life!Blackquill: Who are you calling a panda?!Athena: S-Sorry!Nahyuta: I see that you are both prepared to face the fires of damnation. Geiru, thank you for your service. You may step down now.Geiru: Okey-dokey! Bye-bye-ballooooon!Athena: (Does EVERYTHING have to be about balloons with her...?)Nahyuta: Now, then. I have a witness prepared to testify about the karuta cards.Judge: And who is the witness this time?Nahyuta: The first to discover the body, and someone who witnessed the crime scene firsthand. Mr. Uendo Toneido. The time has come for that ponytailed pair over there to finally let it go, and move on.Judge: Very well. Let's bring in this witness, then.Judge: Witness, please state your name and occupation.Uendo: I am the rakugo storyteller Uendo Toneido. Even if my performance isn't worth watching, I will certainly watch my words. I wouldn't want to say anything thoughtless and get arrested. After all, that'd be... a \"raku-no-no\"! Hee hee! Thank you, everybody! Good night!Athena:Athena: You can't leave yet! You've only just introduced yourself!Uendo: Oh, my, my! Are you a fan of mine, miss? Would you like my autograph? One moment...Athena: Ow! What do you think you're doing?!Uendo: No need to stand on ceremony! My fan deserves a fan, after all. A \"fan\" for a \"fan\"! Nice one! Hee hee! Oh, why if it isn't Simon! How are you on this fine day, sir? Quite a dilly of a pickle we've found ourselves in, wouldn't you say?Blackquill: I don't believe I've ever seen you talk quite so much, Uendo.Uendo: Never performed in a place like this, y'know. I got butterflies here, can't you see? Hee hee!Athena: (Why do I always get the weird ones?)Judge: Pardon me, witness. As much as I enjoy your banter, I believe we had better return to the case at hand.Uendo: Ah, I suppose you're right. In that \"case\"... I was promoted to \"futatsume\" yesterday, and received the stage name of \"Uendo.\" The show was our way of celebrating my new name and \"middle rank\" standing! Hee! And then THAT happened... Haah... I never dreamed something like that'd happen, not in a million years. And just as I got my chance to start repaying my debt to Shisho, too... Yeah... Plus, I'm worried about Geiru... The way she clung to Shisho... Poor thing. I told her to keep a stiff upper lip... Stiff like rigor mortis... Keep telling those lame jokes, and Shisho'll come scold you from the grave! I wouldn't mind getting yelled at, you know, if it meant seeing him again.Athena: Uendo, please... As charming as your various characters are, this isn't a rakugo stage.Nahyuta: Let us hear your testimony now, witness. Tell the court about the evidence left at the scene -- the proof of the accused's guilt.Witness Testimony-- Shisho's Dying Message --Uendo: I noticed Shisho's dying message right away. The stiff cards were right next to the stiff, you see. Hey now, enough with the silly puns already! Hee hee! Anyway, I got the meaning right away. I knew it must've been talking about Bucky! That was the master's final message, left as he was drowning in soba broth. It's so like Shisho not to write Bucky's name outright. \"Plain and simple\" wasn't his style.Judge: Well! That was certainly a more entertaining testimony than usual. The variety of characters performed by the witness was absolutely splendid!Athena: But he shouldn't be performing any characters in the first place, Your Honor! And, Uendo! The murder weapon hasn't been determined yet! So how can you say that the victim was drowned in soba broth?!Uendo: It's obvious. All you have to do is look at the crime scene. He was found with his face shoved in a bowl. It's only natural to assume he was drowned in the broth for the noodles!Athena: Except we're not here to assume things, Uendo, so please stick to just the facts!Uendo: My, my! It's so like a soba chef to kill someone this way, wouldn't you say? And with the karuta message he left behind, it's clear Bucky Whet did it!Judge: Hmm... Setting aside the issue of the murder weapon for now... that dying message certainly does seem to be irrefutable evidence.Nahyuta: Indeed. It proves the absolute guilt of the accused.Athena: Urgh... Even I've gotta admit that I can't see how that message could mean anything else...Uendo: Bucky used soba for the deed, all to get back the soba shop deed.Athena: Nngh! (This testimony makes Mr. Whet look super guilty. I have to do something!)Blackquill: Hmph. That's his \"conclusive evidence\"? What a farce!Athena: What do you mean, Simon?Blackquill: What's this? I thought you said you weren't planning on asking me for help?Athena: Arngh...! I did, and I won't, thank you very much! (Simon must've found an inconsistency in the testimony. I'd better listen carefully, and try to see what he found!)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Shisho's Dying Message --Uendo: I noticed Shisho's dying message right away.Press Athena: Athena: Uendo, when you saw the cards on the table... what made you think they were Master Toneido's dying message? Uendo: Well, it was a coded message right there next to the body. I'm sure anybody would've thought that they were there to name his killer. I love murder mysteries, and often watch them on TV. Athena: O-Oh? I see. Uendo: I saw a similar scene during a murder mystery marathon last Tuesday. That's what made me think, \"This must be a dying message!\"Uendo: The stiff cards were right next to the stiff, you see?Press Athena: Athena: The cards were on the table next to your master's body was slumped over, right? You must've been surprisingly calm to notice them at the time. Uendo: As I said, the stiff cards were right there next to the stiff, so they were hard to miss. Athena: But wouldn't it have been more natural to notice the victim rather than the cards? Uendo: The message just caught my eye, because the stiff cards were right next to the stiff. Athena: Yes, but the fact hardly seems significant enough to make a person take not of them. Uendo: Stiff cards... next to the stiff... Athena: So basically, there was no real reason for them to catch your eye, was there? Uendo: *sigh*...Uendo: Hey now, enough with the silly puns already! Hee hee!Press Athena: Athena: That's right! I need you to give your testimony, not perform a scene! Please remember you're on the witness stand, not the stage! Uendo: But look at all these wonderful people in the audience! It's only natural for an entertainer to want them to have some fun! Hee hee! I guess we can let a few jokes slide, right? Judge: Ah, the inevitable bleeding of your work into other areas of your life. I know how that is. I find myself being unwittingly judgemental in my personal life, too. Uendo: Right, right! That's exactly what I'm talking about! Well done, Your Honor! Guess you can't judge a judge by his cover! Judge: Ho ho ho. I advise the defense not to be so critical of the witness. Athena: Y-Yes, Your Honor. Uendo: Much obliged! Hee hee!Uendo: Anyway, I got the meaning right away. I knew it must've been talking about Bucky!Press Athena: Athena: The cards DO spell out \"WHET NO 4\"... which COULD be interpenetrated as \"Whet Noodle No. 4,\" I guess... I suppose you took this to mean Bucky Whet? Uendo: There's only one \"Whet Noodle\" around here, and you've seen that giant \"4\" on his back. It's the only interpenetration that makes sense! Athena: Yeah, I guess so... But wait a minute! Uendo: Wh-What is it?! Athena: What if there's another \"Whet Noodle\" in the area! Wh-What? Did I say something strange? Blackquill: Bucky is the sole heir to the shop. So enough with the ludicrous straw grasping! Athena: H-Hey! How was I supposed to know...? Blackquill: Just listen to the testimony again, and find the glaring inconsistency.Uendo: That was the master's final message, left as he was drowning in soba broth.Press Athena: Athena: So the victim lined up those cards in his final moments? How can you be so certain that's how it went down?! Uendo: I know Shisho. He would never let someone get the last word on him, even in death. With his face in soba broth, and his consciousness fading away... ...he left a message that pointed toward Bucky as he left this world. It's the only way it could've happened! Athena: Wait! \"The only way\"?! Now you're just speculating! Uendo: Look, a dying message is something you leave as you're dying, right? I saw a scene like that in a detective show. Nahyuta: Nahyuta: Uendo, we have a saying in my country: \"Silence is more precious than diamonds.\" Please do not speak any more than is necessary. Uendo: But talking is my livelihood, you know. I talk all the time. This and that, truths and untruths... I can't stop myself from talking! Athena: (Hopefully, he'll stick to \"truths\" without any of those \"untruths\"...)Present Taifu's Autopsy Report Athena: Leads to: \"There's a contradiction in Uendo's testimony!\"Uendo: It's so like Shisho not to write Bucky's name outright. \"Plain and simple\" wasn't his style.Press Athena: Athena: But don't you think it's strange? Could a dying person... ...really leave such a convoluted message...? Uendo: Even in the throes of death, it was in Shisho's nature to throw in a twist somehow. Truly the consummate entertainer till the very end, don't you think? Athena: Was he really that great of a man, Simon? Blackquill: It would've been no easy task, to be sure. But who knows? He wasn't an entertainer for fifty-five years for nothing. Uendo: If I ever bite the big one like that... ...I wanna leave a dying message as good as Shisho's! Hee hee! Athena: Well, let's hope it never comes to that...Athena: S-Simon, are all rakugo artists like this?Blackquill: Hmph. It's hard to say. It could simply be the eccentricity of an entertainer, or perhaps he's hiding something.Athena: (Well, he doesn't have to entertain people in a court of law. And if he IS trying to hide something, maybe it'll show up as a contradiction or something.)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Simon Blackquill\nDescription: A prosecutor who excels at psychological manipulation.

You must only answer one pair. You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "response_json": {
      "evidence": 3,
      "testimony": 4
    },
    "cot": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking which evidence and testimony contradict each other in the given Ace Attorney case. The answer needs to be in the form of a JSON object at the end, specifying the evidence and testimony numbers.\n\nFirst, I need to go through the testimonies and cross-reference them with the evidence provided. The key here is to find a direct contradiction between a piece of evidence and a specific statement in the testimony.\n\nLooking at the testimonies from Uendo:\n\nTestimony 3: \"Anyway, I got the meaning right away. I knew it must've been talking about Bucky!\" Uendo claims that the dying message (\"WHET NO 4\") refers to Bucky Whet, the defendant. He interprets this as pointing to Bucky as the killer.\n\nNow, the evidence list includes Evidence 7: Karuta Cards, which originally spelled out \"OWEN 4TH\" as shown. However, the current message is \"WHET NO 4\". The original message was altered. This suggests that the message might not have been left by the victim but was changed by someone else, possibly the real culprit.\n\nBut how does this contradict Uendo's testimony? Uendo states that the message was Shisho's dying message, implying that the victim arranged the cards. However, if the original message was different (\"OWEN 4TH\"), then the message as found (\"WHET NO 4\") must have been altered after the fact. This would mean that Shisho didn't write the message pointing to Bucky, so Uendo's assertion that it's the victim's message is false. Therefore, the contradiction is between Uendo's testimony (Testimony 3) claiming the message points to Bucky as the killer and the actual evidence (Evidence 7) showing the original message was different, indicating tampering.\n\nWait, but Evidence 7's description says: \"Karuta cards in the victim's dressing room. They spell out 'WHET NO 4.' Karuta cards in the victim's dressing room. They originally spelt out 'OWEN 4TH' as shown.\" So the original arrangement was \"OWEN 4TH\", but they were rearranged to \"WHET NO 4\". This means that the dying message was altered. Therefore, Uendo's testimony that he immediately knew it was about Bucky is based on a manipulated message, not the original one left by the victim. Hence, the contradiction is between Uendo's Testimony 3 (which claims the message points to Bucky) and the actual evidence (Evidence 7) showing the original message was different, indicating the message was changed, thus undermining Uendo's conclusion.\n\nBut another angle: The Autopsy Report (Evidence 3) states that nothing was found in the victim's lungs. Uendo's Testimony 4 says the victim was \"drowning in soba broth.\" If the cause of death was suffocation but no liquid in the lungs, then the method of death wasn't drowning. So Testimony 4's claim that he drowned in broth is contradicted by the autopsy report. However, the user's question is about which evidence and testimony contradict. The user might have mentioned this in their example when Athena presents the autopsy report. In the provided story, Athena does present the autopsy report to counter Uendo's claim about drowning. So in the cross-examination of Testimony 4, presenting the autopsy report would show a contradiction. But in the current testimonies, Testimony 4 is \"That was the master's final message, left as he was drowning in soba broth.\" The Autopsy Report (Evidence 3) says \"Nothing was found in his lungs,\" which contradicts the assertion that he drowned in broth. That's a contradiction between Evidence 3 and Testimony 4.\n\nBut the user's question is about which pair to choose. The problem here is that the answer requires one pair. Let me check the original story again. When Athena presents the autopsy report during the cross-examination, the contradiction is found. In the user's story, when cross-examining Uendo's Testimony 4 (That was the master's final message, left as he was drowning in soba broth), Athena presents the Autopsy Report (Evidence 3) which states that there was nothing in the lungs, contradicting the drowning claim. Therefore, the correct contradiction would be between Evidence 3 (Autopsy Report) and Testimony 4.\n\nBut wait, in the given testimonies, Testimony 3 is Uendo's claim that he knew the message must've been talking about Bucky. But the Karuta cards (Evidence 7) show that the original message was \"OWEN 4TH\", which was changed to \"WHET NO 4\". That would mean the dying message was altered, so the real message wasn't about Bucky. Therefore, Uendo's Testimony 3 (saying the message was about Bucky) is contradicted by Evidence 7 (original message was different). However, in the provided cross-examination, Athena doesn't present the Karuta cards here. Instead, she presents the Autopsy Report when pressing on Testimony 4. But in the given data, the user's story has Athena present the Autopsy Report when cross-examining the fourth testimony.\n\nWait, in the user's story, during the cross-examination of Uendo's testimony, Athena presents the Autopsy Report (Evidence 3) in response to Testimony 4 (the drowning claim). That leads to the contradiction. Therefore, the correct pair would be Evidence 3 (Autopsy Report) and Testimony 4 (drowning in broth). The autopsy report says no liquid in the lungs, so he wasn't drowned, which contradicts the testimony.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the user asks for one pair. The answer should be {\"evidence\": 3, \"testimony\": 4} in that case. However, the user's data may have a different setup.\n\nAlternatively, the testimony about the dying message (Testimony 3) being about Bucky is contradicted by the Karuta cards (Evidence 7) showing the original arrangement was different. So Uendo's interpretation of the message being about Bucky is based on the altered message, not the original, which could indicate that the message was tampered with, thus contradicting his assertion that it's the victim's message.\n\nBut the problem states that the answer must be one pair. In the story, when Athena cross-examines Uendo's testimony about the message pointing to Bucky, she might present the Karuta cards to show the original message. But according to the given data, in the Cross Examination section, under Testimony 3, when Uendo says \"I knew it must've been talking about Bucky!\", the user mentions Present Taifu's Autopsy Report (Evidence 3) leads to a contradiction. Wait, no\u2014looking back:\n\nIn the user's story during cross-examination:\n\nUnder the testimony \"Anyway, I got the meaning right away. I knew it must've been talking about Bucky!\", the user has Athena present the Autopsy Report (Evidence 3), leading to a contradiction. But in the actual Autopsy Report (Evidence 3), the contradiction is about the cause of death, not the message. Wait, that's confusing. Wait, perhaps there's a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user's story includes:\n\nWhen cross-examining the testimony \"That was the master's final message, left as he was drowning in soba broth.\" (Testimony 4), Athena presents the Autopsy Report (Evidence 3) which states that nothing was found in the lungs, contradicting the drowning.\n\nBut the question is about which evidence and testimony contradict each other. According to the given data, the correct answer is Evidence 3 (Autopsy Report) and Testimony 4 (drowning in broth). Because the autopsy report says no liquid in the lungs, so he didn't drown in the broth, which contradicts the testimony's claim.\n\nAlternatively, the answer could be Evidence 7 (Karuta Cards) and Testimony 3 (message points to Bucky) because the original message was different. But the problem is, in the given story, when Athena presses on Testimony 3, she presents the Autopsy Report, but that doesn't directly relate. However, according to the evidence list, Evidence 7's description includes that the original message was \"OWEN 4TH\", which was changed to \"WHET NO 4\". This suggests that the message was altered, so the dying message was not left by the victim as is. Therefore, Uendo's Testimony 3 (interpreting the message as pointing to Bucky) is based on a falsified message. Therefore, presenting Evidence 7 (Karuta Cards) would contradict his testimony that the message was left by the victim to name Bucky. However, in the user's story, during cross-examination, Athena presents the Autopsy Report instead. But that's for Testimony 4. So perhaps the intended contradiction here is between the Karuta Cards (Evidence 7) and Testimony 3.\n\nBut according to the story, when Athena presents the Autopsy Report during Testimony 4, that's when the contradiction is found. But in the given problem, the user may have another intended answer.\n\nAlternatively, looking back, during the cross-examination of Uendo's testimony, when Athena presses on Testimony 3 (\"I knew it must've been talking about Bucky!\"), the user's story shows:\n\nAthena: The cards DO spell out \"WHET NO 4\"... which COULD be interpreted as \"Whet Noodle No. 4,\" I guess... I suppose you took this to mean Bucky Whet?\n\nUendo: There's only one \"Whet Noodle\" around here, and you've seen that giant \"4\" on his back. It's the only interpretation that makes sense!\n\nAthena: Yeah, I guess so... But wait a minute!\n\nBlackquill: Bucky is the sole heir to the shop. So enough with the ludicrous straw grasping!\n\nAthena: H-Hey! How was I supposed to know...?\n\nBlackquill: Just listen to the testimony again, and find the glaring inconsistency.\n\nThen, Athena is supposed to present the correct evidence here. The Autopsy Report (Evidence 3) relates to the cause of death, not the message. However, the original karuta cards' arrangement (Evidence 7) shows that the message was altered. Therefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 7 (original message \"OWEN 4TH\") and Testimony 3 (Uendo's claim that the message points to Bucky). But how does that directly contradict?\n\nWait, the current message is \"WHET NO 4\", which Uendo interprets as pointing to Bucky. But the original message was \"OWEN 4TH\", which would refer to someone else (Owen?), not Bucky. Therefore, the dying message was changed, meaning the real message was different. Thus, Uendo's testimony that the message was left by the victim to implicate Bucky is false. Therefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 7 (showing the message was altered) and Testimony 3 (the message points to Bucky). Thus, presenting Evidence 7 against Testimony 3 would expose the contradiction.\n\nBut in the user's story, when the user is cross-examining Testimony 3, the correct evidence to present is the Karuta Cards (Evidence 7). However, according to the given data, when Athena presents the Autopsy Report during Testimony 4, that's when the contradiction is found. But the user's question is about the contradiction between evidence and testimony. The answer here depends on which pair is correct based on the story.\n\nAlternatively, considering the given data, in the Autopsy Report (Evidence 3), it says \"Nothing was found in his lungs.\" Testimony 4 says the victim was \"drowning in soba broth.\" If there's no liquid in the lungs, he wasn't drowned. Therefore, Testimony 4 is contradicted by Evidence 3. This is a direct contradiction.\n\nIn the story, Athena presents the Autopsy Report to counter Uendo's claim about drowning, leading to the contradiction. So the correct pair here is Evidence 3 (Autopsy Report) and Testimony 4 (drowning in broth).\n\nTherefore, the answer should be {\"evidence\": 3, \"testimony\": 4}."

Uendo: Well, it was a coded message right there next to the body. I'm sure anybody would've thought that they were there to name his killer. I love murder mysteries, and often watch them on TV. Athena: O-Oh? I see. Uendo: I saw a similar scene during a murder mystery marathon last Tuesday. That's what made me think, \"This must be a dying message!\"Uendo: The stiff cards were right next to the stiff, you see?Press Athena: Athena: The cards were on the table next to your master's body was slumped over, right? You must've been surprisingly calm to notice them at the time. Uendo: As I said, the stiff cards were right there next to the stiff, so they were hard to miss. Athena: But wouldn't it have been more natural to notice the victim rather than the cards? Uendo: The message just caught my eye, because the stiff cards were right next to the stiff. Athena: Yes, but the fact hardly seems significant enough to make a person take not of them. Uendo: Stiff cards... next to the stiff... Athena: So basically, there was no real reason for them to catch your eye, was there? Uendo: *sigh*...Uendo: Hey now, enough with the silly puns already! Hee hee!Press Athena: Athena: That's right! I need you to give your testimony, not perform a scene! Please remember you're on the witness stand, not the stage! Uendo: But look at all these wonderful people in the audience! It's only natural for an entertainer to want them to have some fun! Hee hee! I guess we can let a few jokes slide, right? Judge: Ah, the inevitable bleeding of your work into other areas of your life. I know how that is. I find myself being unwittingly judgemental in my personal life, too. Uendo: Right, right! That's exactly what I'm talking about! Well done, Your Honor! Guess you can't judge a judge by his cover! Judge: Ho ho ho. I advise the defense not to be so critical of the witness. Athena: Y-Yes, Your Honor. Uendo: Much obliged! Hee hee!Uendo: Anyway, I got the meaning right away. I knew it must've been talking about Bucky!Press Athena: Athena: The cards DO spell out \"WHET NO 4\"... which COULD be interpenetrated as \"Whet Noodle No. 4,\" I guess... I suppose you took this to mean Bucky Whet? Uendo: There's only one \"Whet Noodle\" around here, and you've seen that giant \"4\" on his back. It's the only interpenetration that makes sense! Athena: Yeah, I guess so... But wait a minute! Uendo: Wh-What is it?! Athena: What if there's another \"Whet Noodle\" in the area! Wh-What? Did I say something strange? Blackquill: Bucky is the sole heir to the shop. So enough with the ludicrous straw grasping! Athena: H-Hey! How was I supposed to know...? Blackquill: Just listen to the testimony again, and find the glaring inconsistency.Uendo: That was the master's final message, left as he was drowning in soba broth.Press Athena: Athena: So the victim lined up those cards in his final moments? How can you be so certain that's how it went down?! Uendo: I know Shisho. He would never let someone get the last word on him, even in death. With his face in soba broth, and his consciousness fading away... ...he left a message that pointed toward Bucky as he left this world. It's the only way it could've happened! Athena: Wait! \"The only way\"?! Now you're just speculating! Uendo: Look, a dying message is something you leave as you're dying, right? I saw a scene like that in a detective show. Nahyuta: Nahyuta: Uendo, we have a saying in my country: \"Silence is more precious than diamonds.\" Please do not speak any more than is necessary. Uendo: But talking is my livelihood, you know. I talk all the time. This and that, truths and untruths... I can't stop myself from talking! Athena: (Hopefully, he'll stick to \"truths\" without any of those \"untruths\"...)Present Taifu's Autopsy Report Athena: Leads to: \"There's a contradiction in Uendo's testimony!\"Uendo: It's so like Shisho not to write Bucky's name outright. \"Plain and simple\" wasn't his style.Press Athena: Athena: But don't you think it's strange? Could a dying person... ...really leave such a convoluted message...? Uendo: Even in the throes of death, it was in Shisho's nature to throw in a twist somehow. Truly the consummate entertainer till the very end, don't you think? Athena: Was he really that great of a man, Simon? Blackquill: It would've been no easy task, to be sure. But who knows? He wasn't an entertainer for fifty-five years for nothing. Uendo: If I ever bite the big one like that... ...I wanna leave a dying message as good as Shisho's! Hee hee! Athena: Well, let's hope it never comes to that...Athena: S-Simon, are all rakugo artists like this?Blackquill: Hmph. It's hard to say. It could simply be the eccentricity of an entertainer, or perhaps he's hiding something.Athena: (Well, he doesn't have to entertain people in a court of law. And if he IS trying to hide something, maybe it'll show up as a contradiction or something.)Athena: There's a contradiction in Uendo's testimony!Judge: And would you care to explain where, Ms. Cykes?Athena: Certainly, Your Honor. According to the autopsy report, nothing unusual was found in the victim's lungs.Judge: Ah, yes. It does say that, doesn't it?Uendo: .........Athena: If he HAD drowned in a bowl of soba, then there should've been soba broth in his lungs! But since there wasn't any... ...it means the victim was suffocated with something other than soba broth!Uendo: Pyoooooo!Judge: Wh-What?!Athena: This is the contradiction you noticed, isn't it, Simon?Blackquill: Heh. Not bad. Not bad at all.Athena: Heh heh heh. I guess I showed you!Judge: Hmm... But if drowning in the soba broth WASN'T the cause of death... ...then when was the victim's face thrust into that bowl?Athena: Taifu Toneido's face was thrust into the bowl...Before his murder Athena: The culprit first shoved the victim's face into the bowl, and then murdered him. Nahyuta: ...And for what reason, may I ask? Athena: Uhh, well... they did it on a whim! Nahyuta: And you have proof of this? Athena: Umm... Well... it's certainly not impossible! Judge: Enough of the runaround, defense! Athena: (Argh... Well, if it wasn't BEFORE the murder, then...) Leads back to: \"Taifu Toneido's face was thrust into the bowl...\"During his murder Athena: The culprit killed the victim... while holding the victim's face in the bowl! Nahyuta: You just claimed the victim was \"suffocated with something other than soba broth.\" And yet, he could only have suffocated from the broth had his face been in the bowl. Athena: Huh? Now I'm all confused... Judge: \"I'm all confused\"?! is that all you have to say for yourself? Athena: (Well, that cleared my mind right up... Okay, if it wasn't DURING the murder then...) Leads back to: \"Taifu Toneido's face was thrust into the bowl...After his murder Leads to: \"Because no soba broth was discovered in the victim's lungs...\"Athena: Because no soba broth was discovered in the victim's lungs... ...his head would've been placed into the bowl AFTER he was killed! And that's when the soba broth must've been spilled onto the karuta cards. In other words, the victim could NOT have lined up the cards as he was drowning!Judge: Hmm... I see. So it was done AFTER he was already dead... But why would the culprit do such a thing?Athena: Umm... I'm afraid I don't know yet.Nahyuta:Nahyuta: Heh... You boast of psychological expertise, yet you cannot determine such a simple motive? My sides are liable to split at the absurdity.Athena: What, and I suppose YOU know why?!Nahyuta: Of course. Desecrating the body in that manner... ...indicates a strong sense of enmity on the part of the perpetrator.Judge: Yes, that does make sense... It certainly paints a clear picture of the culprits intense feelings toward the victim.Nahyuta: Feelings of resentment over the theft of the soba shop's deed, no doubt.Athena: (Just great. Now the judge has an even more unfavorable impression of Bucky!)Blackquill:Blackquill: Must you come undone at every juncture? If the culprit had time enough to set up Master Toneido's body... ...do you think they would've honestly failed to notice the dying message?Athena: Good point... The cards WERE right in front of his body, after all... Rationally speaking, there's no way the culprit could've missed that, huh.Nahyuta:Nahyuta: Ah, but was the accused rational at the time, given the way he stormed out of that room?Blackquill:Blackquill: Never mind that. I have something more important to ask Uendo.Uendo: M-Me?!Blackquill: You saw the karuta cards firsthand, did you not? Would you care to tell us about them in a bit more detail? Those tiny crime scene photos show us precious little of what I wish to know.Uendo: Well, those cards are from Shisho's special \"Soba Scenes of Tokyo Past\" set. Each card is related in some way to soba.Blackquill: Spare me the history lesson! Just tell me how the cards looked at the scene, and no more!Uendo: Well, uh, there was soba broth spilled all over them...Judge: Hmm... That's not much help, I'm afraid. Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, do you have a photo that shows the cards more clearly?Nahyuta: ............I do. Please accept this meager offering, Your Honor.Judge: Oh, my. What delightful-looking cards!Blackquill: ......Well, well. Tearing Prosecutor Sad Monk's \"conclusive evidence\" apart should be a breeze with this.Athena: Huh?Blackquill: Don't tell me you haven't noticed.Athena: D-Don't be silly! O-Of course I have! (...Not noticed anything. But I can't exactly say that now, can I...?)Karuta Cards added to the Court Record.Judge: Ms. Cykes, do you really see a problem with the prosecution's claim about these cards?Blackquill: Well, go on, then.Athena: A-All right... (It's do or die...! All I have to do is study the picture and...) These cards...Were rearranged Leads to: \"These cards were rearranged!\"Contain a contradiction Athena: These cards contain a contradiction! Nahyuta: Do they? And what exactly is this \"contradiction\" you speak of? Athena: Huh? Oh... Well... You know... Stuuuuuuuff... Judge: Maybe this will stuff some knowledge in that noggin of yours! Nahyuta: I may have said that the accused was not rational at the time of the crime... ...but it appears that the defense is rational at no time whatsoever. Athena: Arngh... Please let me try again. Leads back to: \"These cards...\"Are a kind of riddle Athena: These cards are a kind of riddle revolving around the number four. \"Knock, knock. Who's there? Four. four who?\" Nahyuta: I do hope there is a punch line. Athena: \"Four goodness sake, open the door!\" Judge: Hmm... Not bad, defense. But please allow me these four words. Athena: Certainly, Your Honor. What are they? Judge: What's that riddle \"four\"?! Athena: Arngh... Please let me try again. Leads back to: \"These cards...\"Athena: These cards were rearranged!Judge: But how can you tell?Athena: Please take a good look at these cards, Your Honor. The answer is right in front of us.Judge: Where exactly should we be looking, Ms. Cykes?The pictures on the cards Athena: Each and every picture is related to soba in some way. This can't be mere coincidence! Nahyuta: *sigh* As was stated by Uendo... ...this set is called \"Soba Scenes of Tokyo Past,\" and was designed by the victim. So it is quite natural that each card would be related to soba in some way. Judge: You'd better believe this penalty is not \"mere coincidence,\" either, defense. Athena: Yikes! (How are these cards natural in any way?!) Fine. Let's take another look at these cards then, shall we? Leads back to: \"Where exactly should we be looking, Ms. Cykes?\"The soba broth stains Leads to: \"Please focus your attention on the soba broth stains on these cards.\"The size of the cards Athena: Look, all these cards are... exactly the same size, aren't they? Judge: Yes. Yes, they are. And I have to wonder, defense, if your brain is the same size as these cards? Athena: No, Your Honor. Let's just take another look at these cards, okay? Leads back to: \"Where exactly should be looking, Ms. Cykes?\"Athena: Please focus your attention on the soba broth stains on these cards. The outline of these stains don't match up with the larger stain on the table.Judge: Oh, would you look at that! You're absolutely right! And...?Athena: Please recall that the soba broth was spilled and got on the cards AFTER the murder... ...when the victim's face was placed in the bowl.Judge: Yes, go on.Athena: By the stains, we can see that the culprit deliberately rearranged the cards after that. In other words... ...this message was altered in order to pin the crime on my client!Judge: Wh-What?! Th-Then, if we put the cards back in their original positions...?Athena: We can restore the evidence, and see who the cards were really pointing toward!Judge: Th-That's true!Nahyuta: ...Pohlkun--!Athena: Then what are we waiting for?! Let's do this! (All I have to do is rearrange the cards so that the stains match up!) Let's see. Where was this \"W\" card originally?Present second space from left on top row Leads to: \"Perfect! Okay. The \"H\" card is next.\"Present anywhere else Blackquill: ......Hmph. The stains don't match up if you place that card there. How can you not see that?

I'll try again... Leads back to: \"Let's see. Where was this \"4\" card originally?\"Athena: So the message \"WHET NO 4\"... ...was originally supposed to say \"OWEN 4TH\"! And this original message is our clue to the identity of the true culprit!Judge: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!Blackquill: Heh! That indignant look on Prosecutor Sad Monk's face is positively priceless!Nahyuta: This is absurd!Gallery:So it was originally \"OWEN 4TH\"...?It wasn't \"WHET NO 4\"? Maybe the lawyer is smarter than we thought!Judge: Order! Order in the court! Well! I never would've imagined that there was more to these cards than meets the eye!Karuta Cards updated in the Court Record.Judge: So now that that's settled... what does this \"OWEN 4TH\" mean?!Athena: ............Wait. Am I...?Blackquill: Who else do you suppose is to provide an explanation?! Of course it's you!Athena: B-But I hadn't thought that far yet...Nahyuta: Change the cards around all you'd like, but if you cannot explain what the message means... ...then it is as worthless as you are, defense!Athena: N-Nooooooooooooooo!Nahyuta: And so the spring chick that fancies itself as a graceful swan is brought back down to Earth.Athena: (I have to do something! But what?!)Blackquill: Still your thoughts for a second. There's a perfectly good witness to question over there.Athena: Oh! Right! That's a good idea! (Come on, Athena! Get a hold of yourself!) Uendo, does the phrase \"OWEN 4TH\" mean anything to you?Uendo: No. There's no one named \"Owen\" in the Toneido family, or our circle of friends. Go ahead, ask anybody you'd like!Athena: You can't be serious...Nahyuta: Having rummaged through you empty mind, I see you have, as expected, turned up nothing.Blackquill:Blackquill: Hmph. I'm afraid I have no idea who the devil this \"OWEN 4TH\" is, either. But the fact remains that the cards were rearranged to pin the blame on Mr. Whet. That in itself proves that the defendant isn't the real culprit.Athena:  Prosecutor Blackquill is right! Besides, the important question here is not... ...\"Who does the message point to?\" but rather... ...\"Who rearranged the cards?\"Blackquil: Tsk. Why didn't you point that out eariler if you already knew?Athena: S-Sorry... In any case, there were two opportunities for someone to rearrange the cards. The first was when Mr. Whet entered the dressing room... ...and the second was when Uendo discovered the body.Uendo: Are you accusing me of rearranging the cards? ME, who came to testify out of the goodness of my heart?!Blackquill: Well, you didn't exactly come running out screaming straight away, did you? Even a mere two to three minutes is more than enough time to get up to some devilry. So what exactly were you doing in there, Uendo?Uendo: *sip* *sip*Blackquill: Put down the tea, and spit out your answer!Uendo: Eep! M-Mr. Prosecutor! What's a guy supposed to do at a time like this?Nahyuta: \"Silence is more precious than diamonds,\" witness. Therefore, you need only remain silent. The defense is devious. They are waiting for you to make a slip of the tongue.Uendo: Oh, I see. So that's what you're after, is it? In that case...Your Honor, I've decided not to say another word.Nahyuta: Very good. After all, your right to remain silent is protected by law.Athena: Well, Prosecutor Blackquill? Any other brilliant ideas you'd like to share?Blackquill: Heh heh heh... Ha ha ha ha ha! Did you hear that, Cykes-dono? A rakugo artist who's afraid to speak! Who's ever heard of such a thing!Nahyuta: Are you trying to taunt him into talking? Such a petty trick will never work.Uendo: That's right. I'm not going to fall for it.Blackquill: I'm only asking to hear your story. Besides, is it not your job to tell tales if there is an audience to listen?Uendo: E-Even so, I have a right to refuse to answer.Blackquill: The more you keep quiet, the more we want you to talk. That's simply human nature. Isn't that right, people of the gallery?!Uendo: ...........Blackquil: Even with this wonderful audience in front of you, you still refuse to talk? If so, then perhaps you chose the wrong line of work, my friend!Uendo: Are you saying I should quit?! Because I'm not afraid to speak my mind, I'm have you know. Oh, no! Never mind what I just said! It IS scary to talk! It's absolutely terrifying! But, no! As a rakugo artist, I must talk! If I don't, how can I ever show my face on stage again?! Your Honor, I'm ready to testify!Athena: (H-He did it! He managed to convince Uendo with the power of suggestion technique!)Blackquill: Bully for you, Uendo! That's as a REAL rakugo artist should be!Judge: A-All right... If the witness wishes to testify, then by all means, please do.Nahyuta: To be turned by such an obvious ploy... What a man of weak spirit.Witness Testimony-- In The Dressing Room --Uendo: After my performance, I went to visit Shisho. I called to him from outside the room... but he didn't reply. When I entered the dressing room, I saw Shisho slumped over the table, motionless!Nahyuta: From what I can tell, there do not appear to be any inconsistencies in the testimony.Uendo: Of course there aren't any. Because I'm not trying to hide anything.Athena: (Prosecutor Sahdmadhi's right. I don't see anything inconsistent, either. But I did pick up on some faint discord in Uendo's heart.)Nahyuta: Hmph. Ponder all you would like, defense, but it is pointless. Your Honor. I believe there is no need for further deliberation...Athena:Athena: I disagree, Your Honor! I detected discord in the voice of the witness's heart! That's a clear indication that Uendo is facing some sort of inner turmoil!Judge: Hmm... Are you saying... what I think you're saying, Ms. Cykes?Athena: Yes, Your Honor! The defense would like to conduct a quick therapy session on this witness!Nahyuta:Nahyuta: Uendo, there is no need for you to submit to this so-called \"therapy\".Uendo: It's fine by me! I have nothing to hide. Bring it on!Nahyuta: Impetuous fool! Why will you not listen to the guidance of this humble servant of the Holy Mother?!Judge: If the witness wishes to proceed, I see no problem, Prosecutor.Blackquill: Heh heh heh. In one ear and out the other. It seems this performer has no need for your so-called \"guidance,\" Prosecutor Sad Monk.Nahyuta: Just know this Uendo: Your folly will surely earn you divine retribution.Athena: Thanks, Simon! I'm going to make the most of this opportunity you created for me!Blackquill: Heh. Just keep your wits about you.Athena: I will! Uendo, could you tell us again about what happened in the dressing room?Uendo: After my performance, I went to visit Shisho.Uendo: I called to him from outside the room...Uendo: ...but he didn't reply.Uendo: When I entered the dressing room, I saw Shisho slumped over the table, motionless!Pinpoint Surprised marker Athena: Leads to: \"Uendo, I'm noticing something strange with these emotions.\"Athena: Hmm... I didn't really notice any unexpected emotions in that testimony...Blackquill: But it isn't always a question of the presence of an emotional response, but the absence.Athena: You know... You're right. (It's not always the emotions I do see. Sometimes, it's a matter of what I don't, but would expect so see... I'd better carefully compare Uendo's statements to his emotions again!)Athena: Uendo, I'm noticing something strange with these emotions.Uendo: \"Some thin stranger with cheesy toe skin,\" you say?Athena: No! \"Something strange with these emotions\"! How could you have heard \"some thin stranger with cheesy toe skin\"?!Uendo: I don't know. Maybe it's me who's got some cheese in my ears...Athena: (Did he will the floor to open up and swallow his cushions out of shame for that bad joke?) The point I'm trying to make is that I noticed something unexpected in your emotions! Now stop hiding and come out where we can see you!Judge: Bailiff, please bring the witness a few replacement cushions.Uendo: So what was this unexpected thing you noticed?Athena: Oh, come on! His Honor said a few cushions -- not a few dozen!Judge: Now that we've all had a good laugh, please continue, Ms. Cykes.Athena: (Who's laughing?! Argh! Focus, Athena! Don't let yourself get rattled!) When you entered the room and saw your master slumped motionless over the table... ...you weren't the least bit shocked, Uendo. Don't you think that's a little odd?Uendo: I-Is it, though?Athena: The lack of surprise means you were prepared for what you saw. (And I think I know why... The reason Uendo wasn't shaken when he saw his master's dead body is because...)He was zoned out Athena: Maybe you weren't shaken because you were zoned out! Uendo: Yeah, you got me! I'm a total space case! Ha ha ha! Well, get your head out of the clouds and go do some work for a change! Don't worry, honey! I found a wallet the other day. We have plenty of money to live in now! Athena: Correct me if I'm wrong, Simon, but did he just start doing a routine? Blackquill: Yes. I believe he's telling the famous \"Shibahama Fishmonger\" story. It seems your answer lulled him into such a sense of security that he's zoning YOU out. Judge: A penalty for our spacey defense attorney! Athena (There must've been some other reason Uendo wasn't shaken...) Leads back to: \"The reason Uendo wasn't shaken when he saw his master's dead body is because...\"He has an entertainer's guts Athena: Maybe you weren't shaken because you are an entertainer. Entertainers gotta have guts! Uendo: Sadly, I busted a gut laughing at Shisho's bits last week. Now I'm practically gutless... Does my tale of woe pluck at your gutstrings? Athena: Uh, don't you mean heartstrings? Uendo: Sorry, I was just trying to match... ...the level of nonsense coming out of your mouth, lady! Hee hee! If you don't like it, just say so! Go on, spill your guts! Judge: The witness has a point. You have a lot of guts wasting this court's time! Athena: (There must've been some other reason Uendo wasn't shaken...) Leads back to: \"The reason Uendo wasn't shaken when he saw his master's dead body is because...\"He knew about his master's death Leads to \"Uendo, I think maybe the reason you weren't shaken was because...\"Athena: Uendo, I think maybe the reason you weren't shaken was because... ...you already knew you would find your master dead!Uendo: Pyooooooooooo! Wh-Whaaat?! What kind of a thing is that to say?! You've got it all wrong...! O-Oh, right! I just remembered something! I thought Shisho was just sleeping when I first saw him! Hee hee!NOISE LEVEL50%Athena: You thought he was sleeping? (It sounds plausible, but...) What made you think he was asleep?Uendo: Well, he had his head and arms up on the table, as if he were taking a nap. Oh, and one other thing! There was that note, too!Athena: A note? What note?Nahyuta: Ah, he must be talking about this. It appears to have been written by the victim. Allow me to read it. \"Resting. Do not disturb.\"Uendo: Yes! That's the note I saw! After reading that, who wouldn't think Shisho was napping?!Judge: Hmm... That is a pretty reasonable assumption.Athena: (Y-You've gotta be kidding me...)Taifu's Note added to the Court Record.Uendo: That's right. I saw this note, so that's why I thought Shisho was asleep. I want to change my testimony to include that statement!Athena: All right. I'll run an update.Uendo: After my performance, I went to visit Shisho.Uendo: I called to him from outside the room...Uendo: ...but he didn't reply.Uendo: When I opened the door, I thought he was sleeping.Uendo: But something seemed off, so I rushed over to him.Pinpoint Angry marker Athena: Leads to: \"Uendo, I noticed something funny in your emotions again.\"Uendo: I was shocked to find him dead! I couldn't believe my eyes!Athena: (There was one emotion that seemed out of place given Uendo's action's and statments. I wonder why he felt that particuar emotion then?)Blackquill: If you've noticed something, then hurry up and point it out already.Athena: I know! I'm just trying to be thorough, that's all!Blackquill: Hmph. It looked to me like you were being timid.Athena: I was not! You just watch me pinpoint the heck out of his emotions!Athena: Uendo, I noticed something funny in your emotions again.Uendo: \"Funny,\" you say?! I guess an entertainer of my caliber can make people laugh, even with my emotions!Athena: I didn't mean that kind of \"funny\"! Quite the opposite, actually! When you entered the dressing room, I see that you suddenly felt anger. What I want to know is, what made you feel angry all of a sudden?Uendo: What? Hmm... Let's see... Oh yeah! Now I remember! As I was going in, I whacked my little piggy on something. I was annoyed at my own clumsiness! Hee hee!Athena: Wait, you mean you stubbed your pinky toe?Uendo: J-Just a little bump on my little piggy. N-N-No big deal... I-It's embarrassing, really...Athena: (Sounds more like he's hiding something. I'd better dig a bit deeper.) No need to be embarrassed, Uendo, but I'm afraid it's something we need to look into. Hmm... I don't really see anything you could've stubbed your toe on... ...in the area around the dressing room door in this picture. (But maybe there WAS something there at the time...?) Uendo, what exactly did you stub your toe on?Nahyuta:Nahyuta: What an irrelevant question. You dishonor the soul of the victim with these unnecassary delays.Uendo: You tell her. Really, who doesn't stub their toe every once in a while? You really gotta fuss over every small detail like this?Athena: Um, well... The thing is...Blackquill: ............Athena: E-Even the most subtle of fluctuations in a person's psyche can clue us in to the truth. That's why it's important to get to the bottom of this question! (Plus, if we back down now, who knows what new insult Simon will hurl my way... Is there really no trace of what Uendo stubbed his toe on by the door? What in the world might've been there then, but is not there now?)Present TV or flour track on floor Athena: Leads to: \"Please take a good look at this photo of the crime scene.\"Present table leg indentation on floor Athena: Athena: Uendo, did you stub your toe on this table? Blackquill: Wait a minute... While it does appear that something hit the table and moved it... ...Uendo said he stubbed his toe as he was entering the dressing room. Athena: Yeah... And the table looks pretty far from the door. (Could what bumped into the table also be a clue as to what Uendo stubbed his toe on?) Blackquill: Careless answers will only hurt us here. So think carefully before you speak again. Athena: R-Right! (Is there really no trace left of what Uendo stubbed his toe on by the door?) Leads back to: \"What in the world might've been there then, but is not there now?\"Present anywhere else Athena: Athena Uendo, is this what you stubbed your toe on?  Uendo: Oh, I could never stub my toe on that! That would really be starting things out on the wrong foot! Right, Mr. Golden-Ager? Judge: \"Golden-Ager\"? Don't you dare send me off to the retirement home yet, sonny! Anyway, I hope Ms. Cykes didn't stub her toes on her teeth as her foot entered her mouth. Nahyuta: Well, defense? Are you ready to let it go, and move on now? Athena: Of course not. What Uendo stubbed his little toe on... ...is a vitally important question! (I think. Is there really no trace left of what Uendo stubbed his toe on by the door?) Leads back to: \"What in the world might've been there then, but is not there now?\"Athena: Please take a good look at this photo of the crime scene. Do you see it? This long track that goes from the door, all the way across the room?Judge: Hmm... Now that you mention it, I DO see traces of something getting dragged.Athena: And the drag mark ends... there at the TV. This implies that the TV was originally by the door. I'm convinced that this TV is the object the witness stubbed his toe on. Well, Uendo! How about it?!Uendo: Y-Yes you're right... It was the TV!NOISE LEVEL10%Athena: (There! The noise level dropped again!)Uendo: Y-Yes, I stubbed my pinky toe on the TV. B-B-But what of it? Why is this so important to you?Athena: (So the noise went down, but it hasn't completely dissapeared yet. Which means he's still hiding something... Okay, let's try this tactic instead.) Uendo, why was the TV moved there?Uendo: Shisho must've moved it so he could watch my routine. But what a place to put it! Right in the middle of the doorway like that! I didn't want to bump into it again, so I put it back where it belonged.Athena: Performances onstage can be viewed in the dressing room using that TV?Uendo: That's right. It's a closed-circuit monitor that shows the stage.Crime Scene Report updated in the Court Record.Athena: I-I see. (Now what? I can't find anything else out of place. And I still haven't gotten the noise level down to zero yet...) Simon... I'm still getting noise here, but... ...I don't see anything else fishy.Blackquill: Hmph. This is precisely why amateurs are such a bother.Athena: S-Sorry...Blackquill: I'm in no mood to play nursemaid here, but if that's what it takes to save the soba shop... Hoy, Uendo. Here's a curiosity for you. This table master Toneido is slumped over looks like it was moved. Did you happen to bump into it while you were moving the TV back?Uendo: O-Oh my! Yes, you're right! The TV hit the table, and Shisho's body moved with a jolt... That's when I first realized that Shisho was dead! Oh! But how scared I was!Blackquill: I see. Thank you. We're finally getting a more precise picture of how the body was discovered. But I'd wager you need to put the spurs to Uendo just a trifle longer.Athena: R-Right! (I can't keep asking Simon to bail me out like this! It's time for me to regain my footing and really stand on my own!) Uendo, what you said now about discovering you master's death... Could you please describe all of that again for the court in detail?Uendo A-All right.Athena: But, before you do, let me plug in the latest information...Uendo: After my performance, I went to visit Shisho.Uendo: I called to him from outside the room...Uendo: ...but he didn't reply.Uendo: When I opened the door, I thought he was sleeping.Uendo: I tried to enter the dressing room, but stubbed my toe on the TV.Uendo: When I put the TV back in its normal spot, I realized that Shisho was dead!Uendo: Seeing him slumped over that cluttered table... *sniff*... Oh, Shisho...Pinpoint Surprised marker Athena: Leads to: \"That's odd...\"Athena: Hmm... I'm not really seeing any emotions I'd consider out of place. How about you, Simon?Blackquill: How many times are you going to come running to me?Athena No, um... I was just looking for... a second opinion!Blackquill: Tsk. Well, take another good look at the flow of emotions. Don't just look for simple inconsistencies. Look at the intensity of his emotion, too.Athena: I see... Thanks, Simon!Athena: That's odd... After the initial shock of finding the victim dead, you reacted with surprise again! What was it that surprised you, Uendo, besides your master's death?Uendo: Wh-What do you mean?Athena: What's more, you were even MORE surprised the second time than the first! What could've surprised you more than finding your late master?!Uendo: S-Search me. Your little thingy must've made a mistake!Blackquill:Blackquill: The girl is as sharp as a trout to be sure... but her ability to hear people's emotions is absolute. Now, get to remembering, Uendo! What was it that surprised you?!Athena: (That... was a compliment, right...?)Uendo: Well, I... Er...NOISE LEVEL100%Athena: No! We've pushed him too hard, and he's mentally all over the place! His emotions are completely out of control!Blackquill: \"Out of control\"? Care to explain how that's relevant?Athena: You know how normally, I listen for the hidden emotions in a witness's voice, right? From there, I look for inconsistencies between their testimony and these emotions. But sometimes a person's feelings can run too high, making it hard to get proper readings.Blackquill: So that's how your matrix program works. Fascinating!Athena: Ordinarily, it's just one emotion that runs out of control... But it seems there's nothing ordinary about this time!Uendo: Nnnngh... I... I-I...!Uendo: After my performance, I went to visit Shisho.Uendo: I called to him from outside the room...Uendo: ...but he didn't reply.Uendo: When I opened the door, I thought he was sleeping.Uendo: I tried to enter the dressing room, but stubbed my toe on the TV.Uendo: When I put the TV back in its normal spot, I realized that Shisho was dead!Uendo: Seeing him slumped over that cluttered table... *sniff*... Oh, Shisho...Athena: I knew it...!Blackquill: Hmph. What's got your knickers all in a bunch now?Athena: Uendo has multiple emotions running out of control at the same time! I've never seen anything like this! Ever!Blackuill: So how does one bring a situation like this under control?Athena: I'll have to find the root cause of this tangled mess before I can treat him. If I can identify what is causing this emotional rampage... ...then I can \"Probe\" ([L / LB / Q]) to dive in further. (Changed from [...then I can touch 'Probe' (L) to dive in further.] in the original release) I'll need to point to what I think is the root cause, and hit \"Probe\" ([X / Y / R]) again. (Changed from [I'll need to point to what I think is the root cause, and touch 'Probe' (X) again.] in the original release) Through this process, I can identify exactly what's causing Uendo so much distress!Blackquill: And that will help bring his emotions back under control? In that case, let's get started, shall we?Athena: All right! I can't guarantee success, but it's definitely worth a shot! (Time to look for the root cause of Uendo's rampaging emotions!)Uendo: After my performance, I went to visit Shisho.Uendo: I called to him from outside the room...Uendo: ...but he didn't reply.Uendo: When I opened the door, I thought he was sleeping.Uendo: I tried to enter the dressing room, but stubbed my toe on the TV.Uendo: When I put the TV back in its normal spot, I realized that Shisho was dead!Uendo: Seeing him slumped over that cluttered table... *sniff*... Oh, Shisho...Probe Karuta Cards Athena: Leads to: \"I get it now... The cards were the root of it all.\"Athena: (What could be the root cause of his out-of-control emotions...?)Blackquill: Hmph. Having trouble, are we?Athena: Duh! I can't find the cause of his distress!Blackquill: Isn't it obvious?! It's that bloody question you asked -- that's what pushed him over the edge, remember?Athena: Hey, you're right...!Athena: I get it now... The cards were the root of it all.Uendo: I, er...Athena: Don't try to deny it! You can't hide your feelings from me! The dying message that was left at the scene of the crime... ...is what was causing your distress!Uendo: ............Athena: And if the dying message was the cause of all those feelings... then that means the phrase \"OWEN 4TH\" must mean something to you!Uendo: Nnngh!NOISE LEVEL0%BYE BYEAthena: There! Noise level, zero! Finally!Nahyuta:Nahyuta: The dying message consists of two words: \"OWEN\" and \"4TH.\" But neither of these two words have anything to do with this witness. This topic warrants no further argument.Athena: Sure, there may not seem to be any direct connection... ...between Uendo and the message... ...for now. But why don't you wait and decide what's necessary AFTER you hear my theory?Blackquill: Heh. I trust you've hit upon something, Athena?Athena: Yup! If my theory is right... ...we can finally solve te case of \"Uendo and the Mysterious OWEN 4TH\"!Blackquill: Heh. Well, go on, then!Judge: I can already tell this promises to be interesting. Now, please share your theory with the court, Ms. Cykes.Athena: There was something puzzling to me about Uendo's out-of-control emotions just now. Namely, that there were three distinct reactions present. I had never seen that before, and I wondered how it could be possible.Nahyuta: ...Is there a conclusion to this meandering musing of yours?Athena: Hold your horses, I'm getting there. So, could a person flip between three distinct emotions of such intensity like a switch? In the end, I concluded that it just wasn't possible.Blackquill: Ha ha ha! So that's it, is it?! A bit unconventional, but I'll grant that it's possible within the realm of psychology.Judge: Within the realm of psycology...? I'm afraid you'll have to explain it for the old man up here on the bench.Athena: Your Honor, my theory is that Uendo...Is a robot Athena: You'll be surprised to hear that Uendo is actually a robot! Why not show your true self now, Uendo? Give us an old \"beep boop boop\"! U.3.N.D.0: YOU. ARE. CORRECT. I. AM. A. ROBOT. BEEP BOOP BOOP! Uendo: Hah! What a space cadet! Judge: Oh, very nice! What a good sport the witness is for playing along! With the defense's joke of a theory, that is! Athena: Okay... So he's not a robot... Widget: Beep boop booooop... Leads back to: \"Your Honor, my theory is that Uendo...\"Has supernatural powers Athena: Maybe Uendo has supernatural powers? Uendo: Oh, yes! I make these butterflies dance in the air with psychokinesis. Hee hee! NOT! They're floating on the breeze from my fan, that's all. I'm very sad to say I don't have any supernatural powers. Judge: Ah, you switch between funny and serious characters so seamlessly! Marvelous! If only the defense's conjecturing was as well-practiced. Athena: All right... So no supernatural powers... Leads back to: \"Your Honor, my theory is that Uendo...\"Has multiple personalities Leads to: \"With so many distinct personas, it's clear to me that...\"Athena: With so many distinct personas, it's clear to me that... ...Uendo has dissociative identity disorder!Uendo: PYOOOOOOOOOOOO!Judge: Wh-Wh-Wh-What does that even mean?!Nahyuta: ............ Your Honor, the defense would treat this trial as a child's jest. Multiple personality disorder? A preposterous proposition indeed. Would you not agree, witness?Uendo: H-H-How did she know? How did she figure it out?!Nahyuta: P-P-Pohlkunkaaaa!Athena: I can't believe it... I-I did it! I did it, Simon! I've read papers on it before... ...but to think I'd see a case of it for myself...!Blackquill: Blimey. Rakugo artists tell stories as different characters, but as different personalities?Uendo: Hey, you! Lawyer girl! You got a problem with us?! Huh?!Athena: N-No... No problem at all...Judge: This is all very hard to believe... ...but now that we've established that the witness has multiple personalities... ...could each of them please introduce themselves to this court?Uendo: Uendo Toneido. I'm a rakugo storyteller, as you know.Patches: Hello everybody! Patches, the friendly jester here! Hee hee!Kisegawa: Hmph. Kisegawa. Courtesan.Athena: And is that all of you?Uendo: Yes, that's all of us.Athena: So there are three personalities in total: Uendo, Patches, and Kisegawa, huh. Well, Simon! What do you think now?!Blackquill: Hmph. That you're one lucky duck. Just be glad they were dense enough to help you out.Athena: Argh! Can't you straight up say I did great for a change?Blackquill: Heh.Nahyuta: You appear to be quite proud of yourself, defense... ...but all you have done is infringe upon the privacy of the witness.Athena: I couldn't disagree more, Prosecutor! Now that we know there are three personalities... ...a new way for us to interpret the meaning of a certain piece of evidence has arisen.Nahyuta: A new interpretation?Judge: Ooh, now I'm very curious. What is this piece of evidence you're talking about, Ms. Cykes?Athena: Knowing what we know about Uendo and his personalities, this now makes perfect sense.Present Karuta Cards Athena: Leads to: \"The karuta cards?\"Present anything else Athena: Patches: Wow! You are amazingly heedless, Aren't you! Athena: \"Amazingly heedless\"? Why, Patches! Was that a compliment? Blackquill: Fool! \"Heedless\" means \"careless.\" In other words, you guessed wrong. Athena: Oh... Judge: A needless mistake by a heedless attorney. Athena: Please let me try again, Your Honor. Leads back to: \"Knowing what we know about Uendo and his personalities, this now makes perfect sense.\"Judge: The karuta cards?Athena: That's right, Your Honor. Recall the original dying message left at the scene. We didn't have a clue as to what \"OWEN 4TH\" could've possibly meant. But now, with this new information about Uendo and his personalities... ...isn't it possible that \"OWEN 4TH\" actually means... ...a secret fourth personality of Uendo's -- a personality named \"Owen\"?!Judge: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!Nahyuta: Pohlkunka!Athena: Uendo must have kept his dissociative identity disorder from us because... ...he didn't want to be associated in any way with that dying message!Uendo: N-No! That's not why! We kept our disorder a secret for a diffrent reason altogether.Patches: We've been taking advantage of our affliction to act out various rakugo characters. If word of this got out, well...Kisegawa: ...our reputation as a rakugo artist would be tarnished, as would the Toneido name.Uendo: That's why we kept it a secret from everyone except members of the Toneido School. But really, there is no \"fourth personality.\" It's just the three of us in here.Blackquill: A plausible-enough sounding story... ...but it doesn't prove you didn't rearrange the cards, does it?Uendo: B-But...!Nahyuta:Nahyuta: I will concede that it is highly likely that the witness rearranged the cards.Athena: (Is Prosecutor Sahdmadhi... actually agreeing with us...?)Nahyuta: However, is it not also possible... ...that the accused killed Master Toneido... ...and then left that message in order to frame the witness?Athena: Urngh!Nahyuta: And upon noticing the cards when he found the victim's body, Uendo rearranged them.Blackquill:Blackquill: A fantastic tale, but a tale nonetheless. No one outside the Toneido School knew about Uendo's multiple personalities. Uendo just finished saying so himself.Nahyuta: Ah, that is a true, but ultimately meaningless point. The witness was only in the dressing room for two to three minutes. That's far too little time to commit murder, wouldn't you say?Athena:Athena: Then who's to say he couldn't have done it before his \"discovery\"?Nahyuta:Nahyuta: Ah, that spring chick memory of yours. Have you already forgotten Prosecutor Blackquill's testimony?Athena: (Simon's testimony? ............Oh!)Blackquill: Geiru escorted me to the dressing room... ...but we heard the sound of rakugo being performed from within. Thinking the master was rehearsing, we decided to wait in the hall until he was done.Nahyuta: That's right. Until a few moments before Uendo entered the dressing room... ...Taifu Toneido was confirmed to still be alive!Blackquill: Arnngh!Athena: Nooooooooooooooooon!Nahyuta: Not only that, but Uendo was on stage until just before he discovered the body. A bulletproof alibi that I have already confirmed with several audience members.Athena: Oh, noooooooooooo...!Nahyuta: I also heard that his rakugo performance that day was \"a steaming pile of...\" Well, you get the picture.Patches: Y-Yes, I'm afraid so! Really stunk up the stage, I did! Hee hee!Uendo: And yet, I have a perfect alibi!Nahyuta: Indeed. Why not land the coup de gr\u00e2ce on the defense by describing your alibi, witness?Patches: Okey-dokey-smokey!Witness Testimony-- Uendo's Alibi --Uendo: I was onstage until just moments before I went into the dressing room.Kisegawa: The entire audience was my witness.Patches: But my performance was a huge bust. Not a single soul laughed!Uendo: I'll never be able to live down how terribly I bombed during that very important show.Nahyuta: Uendo was onstage before he found the body, so he could not have committed this crime. It is time to let it all go, defense, and move on.Athena: Ngrrr...! Well, get this, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi! The Wright Anything Agency NEVER gives up! We fight to the bitter end!Nahyuta: Feh! Allow me to say this once more... Let it go, and move on.Athena: And allow ME to say once more, I'm never giving up!Nahyuta: Let it go, and...Athena; Never!Nahyuta: ............... This is pointless. You should have taken advantage of this opportunity while you could, you foolish child! Your worthless convictions only serve to prolong the accused's suffering. If words will not sway you, then perhaps pain will.Athena: Oh, no! A-Anything but this!Nahyuta: Hrnh!Athena: Eeeeeeek! Nnnngyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! What's the big idea, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?!Nahyuta: That was but a small dose of punishment for your misguided convictions. Are you now a bit more inclined to give up, as instructed?Athena: As if!Nahyuta: In that case, you must require another dose!Blackquill: Not bloody likely!Nahyuta: Nrgh!Blackquill: I don't give two flips about your beliefs. But if Cykes-dono were to submit to you here, I won't be able to eat good soba anymore.Athena: Th-That's right! For Mr. Whet's future, and Prosecutor Blackquill's stomach... ...I will NEVER give up!Nahyuta: You will rue those words, defense. Of that, I can assure you.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Uendo's Alibi --Uendo: I was onstage until just moments before I went into the dressing room.Press Athena: Athena: How can you be sure it was you who was on that stage? Uendo: Are you asking whether it could've been some imposter? Athena: I-I guess so. Uendo: Unlike a big arena, a rakugo theater is a cozy, little place. It would be hard to fool an audience in such an intimate setting, don't you think? Athena: Yeah, I guess you're right. Uendo: Good. I'm glad we could clear that up, because I guess you could say...Kisegawa: The entire audience was my witness.Press Athena: Athena: Was there anything special about the stage or your performance that you can tell me? For example, were the lights dimmer than usual? Were there any problems or accidents? Kisegawa: Not a thing. Everything was the same as always. Mr. Prosecutor, you questioned the audience, didn't you? Nahyuta: Yes, of course. Apparently, nothing seemed amiss to them except, well... one small thing. Athena: One small thing? Patches: Oh... it's so embarrassing! I tried my best! Really, I did...Patches: But my performance was a huge bust. Not a single soul laughed!Press Athena:   Athena: Do you have any idea what went wrong? Kisegawa: Hmm... I'm not sure if it was my performance, or if it was just that particular audience... Or maybe it was the story I picked. But every entertainer knows that this kind of thing happens from time to time. Athena: I guess that makes sense... (Still, I wonder how he could've flopped at his own commemorative show? Hmm... Maybe I should dig into things a bit more...) The number of audience members Athena: How many people were there in the audience when you were onstage? Kisegawa: Well, let's see. We drew a full house, so... I think there must have been fifty, maybe sixty people in the audience. Athena: That's quite a lot, isn't it? Patches: Exactly! I dropped a big, stinky bomb in front of all those people. It was a catastrophe, I tell you! I was sweating buckets from start to finish! Athena: (That sounds exactly like how Apollo performs in court sometimes...) I-I see. Thank you. As for that statement, Your Honor, I'd like to... Have it added Athena: Your Honor, could I please have that last statement added to Uendo's testimony? Judge: Hmm... very well. Adds statement \"I think there must have been fifty, maybe sixty people in the audience.\" if not already added, or changes statement from \"The story I performed is called \"Tokisoba\" -- otherwise known as \"Time Soba.\"\" to \"I think there must have been fifty, maybe sixty people in the audience.\" Leave it out Athena:  (I guess it doesn't really matter how many audience members there were.) Never mind, Your Honor. There's no need to add that statement to Uendo's testimony. Judge: All right. Leads back to cross-examination What Uendo performed Athena: Can you tell me which rakugo story you performed? Uendo: I could, but I'm not sure if it would mean anything to the uninitiated. Athena: W-Well, even if I might not get it... ...can't you at least try me? Uendo: All right. If you insist... The story I performed is called \"Tokisoba\" -- otherwise known as \"Time Soba.\" Athena: \"Time Soba,\" huh? (Maybe Uendo's right... He's only said the name of the routine, and I'm already lost.) Nahyuta: Ah... So you performed \"Time Soba,\" did you? Athena: What?! You know it, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?! Nahyuta: In the course of my studies last night, I became familiar with a number of stories. I must say, defense, you would do well to prepare yourself better for your next trial. Athena: Nnrrgh... Simon, what's \"Time Soba\" about? Blackquill: Hmph. Look it up yourself. Nahyuta: Allow me to give an overview. The story takes place on a winter's night. A man orders a bowl of soba at a street stall. \"How ya doin', sir? What can I get for ya?\" \"I see you've got seaweed-topped hanamaki soba, and mixed topping shippoku soba.\" \"I'll have a bowl of shippoku, my good man. It sure is cold tonight, isn't it?\" \"But there's nothing like a hot bowl of noodles and soup to warm the soul!\" \"Ya know it, sir! One skippoku, comin' right up!\" \"So, how's business?\" \"Not so great, sir.\" \"Is that so? Well, that's great, because things can only get better from here, right?\" Judge: Wow, Prosecutor! Nahyuta: The customer talks on and on like this. Finally, when he is done eating, he goes to pay for his soba. \"So how much do I owe you?\" \"That'll be sixteen mon, sir.\" \"I see... Sorry, but I only have small change on me.\" \"I'll count the coins into your palm, so could you hold out your hand for me?\" \"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...\" \"Hey, what time is it?\" \"It's nine, sir.\" \"...Ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen. Thanks, and bye!\" Judge: Ha ha ha ha ha! very well done, Prosecutor Sahdmaadhi! That was excellent! Athena: Huh? I don't get it! What was so funny about that? Blackquill: Tsk. Don't you see? The customer paid with coins, counting them out one by one. Then, just after counting \"eight\", he asked about the time... ...and the soba vendor answered with \"nine.\" Athena: Oh! Now I get it! He made the vendor say \"nine,\" and then he continued counting from \"ten\"! Blackquill: Exactly. He cheated the soba vendor out of one mon with his smooth talking. The story continues with another man who saw the whole things and tries to do the same. But he bungles up the trick, and ends up paying more than sixteen mon for his soba. The story ends on that as the punch line. You can look up the rest of the details yourself. Or, I'm sure Prosecutor Sad Monk over there would love to perform it for you after court. Athena: So, basically, it's a story about a man cheating on his soba bill! That's kind of petty, isn't it? Nahyuta: Hmph. Is that really ALL you have to say about this classic story? \"Time Soba\" is such a well-known staple of rakugo that the skill of the artist is critical in-- Blackquill: Blackquill: Fine. So you studied a lot. But we haven't the time for a lecture detour right now, Prosecutor Sad Monk! Judge: Aww... I wanted to hear a bit more... But, I suppose it is off-topic. Getting back to the matter at hand, Ms. Cykes, the witness stated that... \"The story I performed is called 'Tokisoba' -- otherwise known as 'Time Soba.'\" Would you like to add this statement to his testimony? Athena:  Hmm, should I have that statement added to the testimony? Have it added Athena: Yes, Your Honor. I'd like to have it added. Judge: Very well. Adds statement \"The story I performed is called \"Tokisoba\" -- otherwise known as \"Time Soba.\"\" if not already added, or changes statement from \"I think there must have been fifty, maybe sixty people in the audience.\" to \"The story I performed is called \"Tokisoba\" -- otherwise known as \"Time Soba.\"\" Leave it out Athena: (The show's program doesn't seem all that relevant to this case...) I don't need it to be added at this time, Your Honor. Judge: I see. Very well. Leads back to cross-examinationUendo: I'll never be able to live down how terribly I bombed during that very important show.Press Athena: Athena: Excuse me for asking, but... do you bomb like that on a regular basis? Kisegawa: Well, aren't YOU a regular rude daisy?! Do you really think a rakugo artist who regularly bombs would get promoted? In fact, I'm known as the Toneido School's \"Whirl-Uendo of Laughter,\" I'll have you know! Athena: I-Is that really true, Simon? Blackquill: That nickname is a bit of a travesty, if you ask me. But his rakugo is solid and well-received, yes. Athena: I see... But, yeah. \"Whirl-Uendo of Laughter\" IS a big ol' stink bomb of a name, isn't it? Whew! What a relief! I thought it was just me! Uendo: ............ Athena: I-I mean uh, \"Whirl-Uendo of Laughter\" is great! Funny stuff! Patches: Hee hee. I'm glad you like it!Uendo: I think there must have been fifty, maybe sixty people in the audience.Press Athena: Athena: So there were about fifty to sixty people at the theater listening to your rakugo... ...and not one of them laughed? Uendo: That's right. Everybody was just staring in silence at me. It was simply awful. Athena: (Yikes. That does sound awful!) But with an audience of that size... ...is it even possible for not even one person to laugh? Kisegawa: What are you trying to say? Athena: I'm saying, are you sure there were even people in the audience?! After all, no one would be laughing if there was no one there to begin with.  Patches: O-Of course here were people in the audience! It was a full house, I tell you! Lots of regular. Want me to ask 'em all to come here?  Athena: N-No... That's all right... Blackquill: Don't just press him on every statement at random. You have to put some thought into it! Use your head, Athena! Athena: Eeeeek! (Simon's right. I have to be more careful with the testimony I draw out.)Uendo: The story I performed is called \"Tokisoba\" -- otherwise known as \"Time Soba.\"Press Athena: Athena: The story where a man cheats on his soba bill, right? Why do you think it didn't go over well? Kisegawa: Well... I suppose I was a little nervous... It's a lot of pressure when you're the star of such an important show, you know? Athena: You? Nervous? I thought you'd be all calm and collected, but I guess even you can get stage fright, huh. Uendo: I wanted so badly to live up to the great name of \"Uendo\" that I inherited... ...that I guess I overperformed a little this time. Athena: Wait, \"Uendo\" was the stage name of a former member of the Toneido School, right? Uendo: That's right. The name belonged to one of Shisho's former disciples who died of illness at a young age.

    "cot": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking which evidence and testimony contradict each other in the given case. The testimonies and evidences are listed, and I need to find a pair where the evidence directly contradicts one of the testimonies.\n\nLooking at the testimonies provided, Uendo's testimony 3 is about his performance bombing during an important show. The key here is the invitation (Evidence 5), which states that the show \"Time Soba\" was to be performed by Master Toneido himself, not Uendo. But according to testimony 5, Uendo says he performed \"Time Soba\". However, the invitation indicates that the master was supposed to perform it. That's a contradiction because if the master was supposed to do it, but Uendo did, there's a discrepancy in the alibi. Wait, but in the story, Uendo was performing instead of the master, which might mean the invitation's planned performance didn't happen. So if Uendo performed \"Time Soba\" instead of the master, that could be a contradiction because the invitation shows the master was supposed to. Therefore, the invitation (evidence 5) contradicts testimony 5 where Uendo claims to have performed \"Time Soba\". But the user provided testimonies 0-5, with testimony 5 being about the story performed. The invitation says the master was to perform \"Time Soba\", but Uendo says he performed it, which shouldn't have been the case. So the contradiction is between the Invitation (evidence 5) and Testimony 5 (Uendo's statement about performing \"Time Soba\"). Because the invitation says the master was supposed to perform it, not Uendo. Hence, this contradiction undermines Uendo's alibi because if he performed the story the master was supposed to, there's a problem with the timeline or the setup of the performance. Therefore, the correct pair is evidence 5 (Invitation) and testimony 5."

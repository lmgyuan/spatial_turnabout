    "prompt": "You are provided with a list of characters, evidences and testimonies.\nStory:\n...t admit it: you don't have a clue what happened. Maya: No! We just don't have enough information! Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: What about this? Maya: You like showing that off, don't you, Nick? Phoenix: (My poor, poor ego...) Anything else Phoenix: What about this? Maya: Sorry, but I don't see how that will help us figure this out... October 16Detention CenterVisitor's Room Maya: ... Phoenix: What's wrong, Maya? It's him! In the flesh! Maya: Umm... Is that guy really him? Phoenix: Whaddya mean \"that guy\"? Of course it's him! Will Powers, our client! That's him. Maya: Um, maybe I shouldn't be saying this... But he definitely did it. Murder. At least once. Maybe twice. Phoenix: Whoa whoa whoa! What are you saying!? Will: Umm... Maya: Y-yes!? Will: Something wrong...? Maya: N-no! No! Phoenix: (This is getting off to a great start.) Will: I know, I know. You're disappointed, aren't you? Maya: D-disappointed!? Oh, no. Oh no. Will: No, it's okay. This is the real me. When I got the part of the Steel Samurai, with that mask... I decided I would never show my face in public until the job was over. It's the kids, you know. I didn't want to wreck their dreams. Maya: Oh... Will: I guess it didn't matter. So much for dreams. I wonder what they think of the Steel Samurai now. *sniff* Uwaaah! Maya: Nick! Phoenix: What? Maya: He's a good guy! I mean, he's good! Phoenix: Yeah. Maya: He didn't do it! Phoenix: ... Examine Security camera Phoenix: Smile for the camera... Security guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. He seems frozen in awe of Will Powers. Talk What happened Phoenix: Maybe you could start by telling us what happened. Will: Y-yes. Of course. It seems like it was only yesterday. Actually, it was only yesterday. The cast had come down to Global Studios for a run-through. We went through a few action sequences at 10:00 that morning. There was a rehearsal scheduled for 5:00 in the afternoon. But when 5:00 came around, and the staff gathered at the studio... The Evil Magistrate was found lying in a crumpled heap near the set. They took off his mask... And discovered that it was Jack Hammer... dead! He had been expertly skewered with the Samurai Spear. Phoenix: The \"Samurai Spear\"...? Will: Yes, it's a long spear that I... that the Steel Samurai uses as a weapon. The Steel Samurai Phoenix: Maybe you could explain to me just what \"the Steel Samurai\" is. Maya: Nick! How could you say such a thing? I-I'm sorry, sir, I apologize for my partner! He's new to this, and a bit OUT OF TOUCH with the world. Phoenix: Hey! Who's \"new to this\"!? Will: No, it's alright, really. The Steel Samurai is the lead character in a popular kid's show. He walks the streets of Neo Olde Tokyo... Fighting battle after battle against the Evil Magistrate and his minions. Of course, he never really defeats the Evil Magistrate. Although... I guess he did defeat him this time... *sniff* Uwaaah! Phoenix: I-I see. (Neo Olde Tokyo...? Who comes up with these names!?) Powers's alibi (appears after \"What happened\") Phoenix: Now, where were you on the day of the murder? Will: Well, that morning I came to studios at 9:00. We worked through some action scenes until noon. Rehearsal was to begin at 5:00, but I was a little tired. So after lunch, I took a nap in my dressing room. When I woke up, it was after 5:00! I was late for the rehearsal! I hurried to the studio... and found everyone looking shocked. They arrested me on the spot, and brought me here. Phoenix: (So he was sleeping the entire afternoon of the murder? Some action hero!) Will: What will the kids think? *sniff* Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Um, here. Will: I... I see. ... Phoenix: (Let me guess... this guy wasn't the top student in improv class.) Anything else Will: I-I'm sorry. I'm sure that's very important and all. I just don't see what it has to do with my problem. After clearing \"Powers's alibi\" Talk option: Phoenix: I think I should probably check out the scene of the murder... Will: Right... Global Studios. I'll draw you a map. Maya: Wow! Nick! Let's go! Phoenix: (I'm willing to bet 10 bucks she asks for autographs.) Wright & Co. Law Offices (after clearing \"Powers's alibi\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room) Talk What to do Phoenix: Well, what should we do? Maya: Sitting around here won't get us anywhere, that's for sure. The studio! We should go to the studio! I'm sure we could find some clues there! Phoenix: (Does she want to investigate this case or just do some sightseeing, I wonder? My money's on sightseeing.) October 16Global StudiosMain Gate Maya: Wow! So this is where they make the Steel Samurai show! Awesome! Aren't you excited!? Oldbag: Hey! You there! You want in, you gotta go through me! Maya: O-oh... s-sorry! W-we're, um, lawyers. Oldbag: Oh yeah? Well that's great. I'm security! And it's my job to make sure that gawkers like you stay OUT. Maya: G-gawkers? Oldbag: Gawkers! Sightseers! Tourists!!! I know the type. You heard about the incident and came to snoop around. Youths today! Something horrible happens and all you can think of is sightseeing. Wasting your time at a place like this. Don't you have jobs you should be doing? Or do lawyers not work like the rest of us? Maybe I should become a lawyer too. Sounds like a life of ease to me no work just loafing around all day as you please. Well when I was young things were a mite different, mind you we didn't prance around in strange hippie clothes. What are the youths coming to these days my own son hasn't called in... Maya: Umm... Nick? Will I grow up to be like her? Please say \"no.\" Phoenix: I dunno! It's possible. Oldbag: Hey! Listen when you're being spoken to! Youths today! Examine Computer Phoenix: The computer that runs the studio security cameras. Oldbag: Hey! No touching! Guard station Phoenix: The security guard station. That security lady must like junk food. There's a mountain of it on the desk in there. I can see the computer that runs the security cameras. Main gate Phoenix: The main entrance to the studio. There was a big scene here yesterday with onlookers pressing up against the gate. Studio map Phoenix: An overhead map of the studios. Right from here is the Employee Area. To the left are the actual film studios. Studio van Phoenix: Looks like a studio van. They probably use it to carry around film equipment. Talk The studios Phoenix: So, what do you do here at the studios? Oldbag: At Global Studios, we make children's dreams come true! In fact, in my younger days... Maya: No! You were a star!? Oldbag: Only a little twinkle between the stars here, I'm afraid, dearie. Maya: Wo... wow. Oldbag: This place has really gone downhill, you know? But 10 years ago, now that was a studio of dreams! Hammer was a big star back then too, he was... Phoenix: Hammer...? Oldbag: The victim, dummy! The Evil Magistrate! He's been reduced to playing villains now. Not exactly the best material to work with... Will Powers Phoenix: Can you tell me about Mr. Will Powers? Oldbag: He's not a bad kid, but don't be fooled by his mask! You wouldn't want him on the silver screen without it, believe me. Little old ladies watching would lose their lunch! That's probably why he thought that the Steel Samurai was his \"big chance.\" No one thought he was capable of doing what he did to poor Jack Hammer... Maya: We don't know for certain that Will Powers is guilty! Oldbag: Powers? Of course he's guilty! How do I know? I know everything! That's my job. Mr. Hammer (appears after \"The studios\") Phoenix: What kind of person was Jack Hammer? Oldbag: What \"kind of person\"? Oh... if you only knew! Jack Hammer will live on in many hearts as the ultimate action hero! He was simply dashing in the Dynamite Samurai series! Phoenix: (Should I have heard of that...?) Oldbag: But... there was an accident during filming five years ago. He got an unlucky break after that. Reduced to playing the villain on a children's program! What's more, I heard they were paying him peanuts. It's enough to make you cry. Reason for suspicion (appears after \"Will Powers\") Phoenix: Why are you so certain Mr. Powers is the killer? Oldbag: I was standing right here yesterday, I was. I was here from 1:00 in the afternoon, to 5:00, when they found the body! Now the studio where the murder took place is to the left here. So if you want to go to the studio, you have to pass by me! Only one person went by here between 1:00 and 2:30, when the murder took place! Phoenix: And... that person was Mr. Powers? Oldbag: Yes. I saw him! Phoenix: But Mr. Powers says he was sleeping in his dressing room. Oldbag: Oh, I'm sure he would say that. He's no fool! But he was the only one that walked by. He's the killer, you can bet your biscuits on it. Present Anything Oldbag: What's that? You giving that to me? Phoenix: (Absolutely not!) After clearing all Talk options: Oldbag: Isn't it about time for you to be heading home? There's nothing to see here. Move along. Phoenix: Um, actually, we're here at Mr. Powers's request. Oldbag: Hmph! I thought you were suspicious lookin'! Show me a \"letter of request.\" And maybe I'll just let you in. Maya: This lady here thinks she owns this place, obviously. Detention Center Will: Hello! How was the studio? They all think I did it, don't they? Maya: N-no, not at all! Isn't that right, Nick? Phoenix: Right, not at all. At worst, you're a suspect. Will: *sniff* Talk Your alibi Phoenix: Mr. Powers, you aren't hiding anything from me, are you? Will: W-what? No! I'd never do that! Phoenix: Just now you said that you were sleeping in your dressing room after lunch. Will: Yes. Like a baby. Phoenix: But the security lady said she saw you that day. She says she saw you heading towards the scene of the crime! Will: W-what!? That's not possible! I... I really don't know what to say! I was sleeping, I promise! Phoenix: Mr. Powers, if you want me to help you, you have to tell me the truth. I'm new to this lawyer business, and I need every advantage I can get. Will: I know... I-I'm sorry. *sniff* But, I swear to you on my momma's grave, I was sleeping. Maybe the security lady only thought she saw me? Phoenix: (What did she see...? He doesn't seem to be lying.) The security lady Phoenix: Umm... about the security guard at the main gate to the studio... Will: Oh, the security lady? Maya: She's terrible! She called me \"suspicious lookin'\"! Will: Y-yes... actually, she's said the same thing to me before. \"Take off that mask!\" were her words, I believe. She sucks up to all the bigwigs at the studio... But let her see you stumble once and she'll never let up on you. Maya: Grr! She's got some nerve! Phoenix: Do you think you could write up a letter formally requesting my representation? Will: Of c-course. Powers's Request added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (I just hope this will get me past that security lady.) The security lady (subsequent times) Phoenix: Umm... about the security guard at the main gate to the studio... Will: Oh, the security lady? Maya: She's terrible! She called me \"suspicious lookin'\"! Will: Y-yes... actually, she's said the same thing to me before. \"Take off that mask!\" were her words, I believe. She sucks up to all the bigwigs at the studio... But let her see you stumble once and she'll never let up on you. Maya: Grr! She's got some nerve! Present Powers's Letter Phoenix: Thank you for the letter of request. Will: Show that to the security lady and she should let you in. Wright & Co. Law Offices Present Powers's Letter Phoenix: Hey, look what I have! Maya: Hey! The Steel Samurai said we'd need that to get into the studio. Phoenix: You mean Will Powers said we'd need it...? Maya: Yes, the Steel Samurai. Phoenix: *sigh* Studio - Main Gate Present Powers's Letter Leads to: \"Ma'am, have a look at this.\" Phoenix: Ma'am, have a look at this. It's a letter of request from Mr. Powers. Oldbag: Hmm...? Yes, yes. I recognize the bold, childish scrawl. Gave Powers's Request to the security lady. Oldbag: To think he would entrust his fate to youths of such unreliable appearance... Really! Phoenix: Really? Oldbag: Anyway, you may pass. But only left from here, toward the studios! No going to the right. That's the Employee Area. \"No one allowed inside, pal\" were my instructions. The good detective told me himself. Maya: Hey, hey, Nick. Phoenix: Huh? Maya: There were maps in the security guard station. Phoenix: Hey! Not bad! Oldbag: Those are 50 cents a piece, thank you! Maya: Well, time to go, Nick. Oldbag: 50 cents! Guidemap of Global Studios added to the Court Record. October 16Studio One Entrance Gumshoe: Hey! Aren't you that murderer from the other day! Maya: Aah! It's that confused detective! Gumshoe: Hey pal, you know Prosecutor Edgeworth is all upset, and it's your fault! I saw him sipping tea and staring gloomily out the window! Phoenix: Umm... so? Maya: Hey! If he's depressed, it's all your fault for doing sloppy detective work! Gumshoe: !!! ... ... ... Maya: Um, Detective? Phoenix: I think you hurt his feelings. Maya: Oh no! I... I'm sorry! Phoenix: Well, I think his feelings are easily hurt. Gumshoe: You're right, pal. It's all my fault. I can blame other people all I want, but I know the truth in my heart! Maya: Hey, hey! Don't take it so hard! There's always the next case! Gumshoe: Yeah, I suppose you're right. Hey! What exactly are you two doing here? Maya: Um, well... We're on this case too, pal! Gumshoe: Huh!? Hey! You can't just go saying \"pal\" like that! That's MY endearing character trait! Maya: I'd say he's a character alright... Examine Bench Phoenix: I'm a little bushed. Maybe I'll take a short rest here. Gumshoe: Hey, good idea, pal! Maya: Detective! Aren't you on the case? Gumshoe: W-well, yeah, but... Hey, us detectives get tired of standing around too, pal! Left path Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe, what's down the path to the left? It looks like a tree fell down over the path...? Gumshoe: Oh, yeah. That way's kind of dangerous. You should stay out, pal. There's nothing down there, anyway. That's where Studio Two used to be, they tell me. They don't use it now, though. Statue with broken head Phoenix: The studio mascot. I guess it's a monkey of some kind. But what kind of monkey has a nose like that? He's holding a sign in his hand. [Right: To Studio One; Left: To Studio Two] Maya: What's up with that thing!? It looks kind of... busted. Gumshoe: Oh, the wind was pretty strong yesterday, and the head broke off. It took that tree down with it, too. Security camera Phoenix: Hey, there's a camera here. Gumshoe: That's the security camera. It takes photos of people going to the studio. All you have to do is look at the data and you can see who went where! Phoenix: There's a number plate on the camera... [ST1-307]. That must be the camera ID number. Studio One entrance Phoenix: The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body. Maya: Let's go in and check it out, Nick! ... Hey! It's locked! Phoenix: Looks like you need a cardkey to get in. It makes sense that they would want to keep the non-employees out. Welcome sign Maya: There's a big welcome sign above the path. Gumshoe: Yeah, apparently the studio's fallen on tough times. They've started letting people in on days they aren't filming. They make a bit of extra money by charging for admission. Maya: Huh. You sure know a lot about this place, Detective. You know, you could always quit being a detective and work here? Phoenix: Yeah! And what perfect timing, with the monkey's neck broken and all. Gumshoe: Huh? Just what's that supposed to mean, pal!? Talk The investigation Phoenix: So, how is your investigation going, Detective? Gumshoe: Well, it's... Hey! I can't tell you that, pal. Maya: Nick... Maybe you need to be a little more indirect with your questions? Phoenix: Right. So, Detective, mind if I take a look at what you got? Gumshoe: What I got? Phoenix: The autopsy report! The latest version, if you please... Gumshoe: Hmm... right, right. Sorry about what happened last time, pal. Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. The investigation (subsequent times) Phoenix: So, how is your investigation going, Detective? Gumshoe: I'm not at liberty to give you any more information, pal. You'll hear all you need to know in court! Phoenix: (Oh well, it was worth a try.) Reason for arrest Phoenix: Why was Mr. Powers arrested? Gumshoe: Simple, pal! The murder took place right over there in Studio One. Now, the victim entered Studio One at approximately 1:00 PM. At that time, there was no one other than the victim in the studio. According to the autopsy report, the time of death was 2:30 PM. Only one person went to the studio between 1:00 and 2:30! And that person was none other than Will Powers! No one else, pal! If you think I'm lying, ask the security lady at the main gate. Maya: Nick! If that's true...! Anyone would think that Powers did it with that kind of evidence! Phoenix: Thanks for cheering me up... The security lady Phoenix: About the security lady... Gumshoe: Oh, that sweet old lady. What a charmer! Phoenix: Huh? A-are we talking about the same person? Gumshoe: When I showed her my badge she gave me a donut and some coffee! Maya: Remember what Powers said. She's a sucker for authority. Gumshoe: She even gave me a piece of valuable evidence! Maya: Whaat!? Decisive evidence (appears after \"The security lady\") Phoenix: What kind of evidence!? Gumshoe: Well, that, er, photo. The photo of the Steel Samurai heading toward the scene of the crime! Maya: What! Who took that!? Gumshoe: See the camera up on that gate, pal? Maya: The gate? You mean the one with the welcome sign? Gumshoe: Yeah. Whenever someone walks by, that camera automatically snaps a photo of them! Maya: Oh no! Nick, he has evidence! We're finished! Phoenix: (Funny, for someone with hard proof he doesn't look too happy.) Gumshoe: ... Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Detective, see this? This is my attorney's badge. Gumshoe: Uh huh? Don'tcha think it's a little sad when you have to explain what your badge means, pal? Real men show their P.D. badge and that's that! Phoenix: I'll admit the design of my badge leaves a lot to be desired... Maya: Maybe it should just be a big \"L\" for \"Lawyer\"? Phoenix: Hmm... I'm not so sure about that. Anything else Phoenix: Um, Detective. Any ideas about this? Gumshoe: Look, I don't got time to look at every little trinket you got, okay pal? After clearing \"The investigation\" and \"Decisive evidence\" Talk options: Gumshoe: What's wrong, pal? You seem down. Phoenix: Don't look so happy when you say that. Gumshoe: Oh hoh hoh hoh hoh! Maya: Umm... We'd like to ask the employees here some questions... Gumshoe: Sure thing, pal. Go wherever you like. Of course, you're not going to find any clues I haven't already found! Hah hah hah! Phoenix: (I'm glad someone around here seems to be enjoying themselves.) Maya: Nick, let's go! We've got a free pass to the place. Now's our chance to check things out! Studio - Main Gate Maya: Nick! Look! That security lady is in the guard station stuffing her face with donuts! I guess all cops like their donuts! Phoenix: Yeah, and they're soft enough she doesn't need teeth to chew them... Oldbag: Hey, you! Well? Are you satisfied Powers is guilty yet? Phoenix: (Urk! She had to make my life harder by giving that photo to Detective Gumshoe...) Talk Photographic proof Phoenix: Why didn't you tell us about the security photo, ma'am? Oldbag: Hmm? Oh, that? I just thought it would be more thrilling to talk with the detective himself! These things are important, you know. Oh, just to the left from here is the gate with the camera that took that photo. It's my job to check the photos every day, you see. Reason for suspicion Oldbag: This guard station is in a central position. No matter where you go here, you pass by my station first! Now poor Hammer, he went to the studio just before 1:00. The murder happened right around 2:30, see? The only one I seen go through here between 1:00 and 2:30 was Powers himself! The security camera got a good look at him too. If he's not the one what did it, I don't know who is! Phoenix: Maybe... it was you? Oldbag: Gyah hah ha hah! Good one, sonny. Phoenix: (She thinks I was joking.) Mr. Hammer Phoenix: Was the victim, Mr. Hammer, a popular actor? Oldbag: Oh, he was the biggest star in the studio! Phoenix: (\"Was\"? Past tense?) Maya: Oh yes! He was great as the \"Bearded Samurai\"! Oldbag: That too, yes. He shone the brightest! Back in the day. Making a star like him play the \"Evil Magistrate\"... It's a disgrace, I tell you! Hammer took it pretty hard, and who can blame him? Automatic camera (appears after \"Photographic proof\") Phoenix: About the security camera... Oldbag: Oh yes, the camera. It's automatic. It can tell when someone walks through that gate, see? Then it snaps a photo! Apparently, it records the time when it takes a picture too. But I don't bother myself with those details. I just view all the photos on the computer over in the security guard station. I check 'em every day before going home, I do. October 16Wright & Co. Law Offices Maya: What's going on, Nick!? Powers said he was sleeping in his dressing room! But now there's a photo of him going to the studio!? Phoenix: Don't look at me! How should I know? Talk What to do Phoenix: What do you think? Maya: That photo the detective was talking about is the problem here. Phoenix: Well, that's hard to say, without seeing the actual photo ourselves. But if it is Powers in that photo, his alibi is shot. Photographic proof Phoenix: Only one person went to the scene of the crime before the murder took place. And there's a photograph to prove it. Maya: I guess it makes sense that that person is the killer then. What do we do, Nick? Phoenix: Maybe there was someone else who could have gone to the scene other than Powers? Let's take a look. Maybe that security lady missed someone? Maya: On thing's for sure, if there are any clues, they'll be in that studio. October 16Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: ... Maya: Apparently they have Mr. Powers in questioning. Phoenix: Hmm... right. Gumshoe: Look pal, that camera takes a picture automatically whenever someone walks by. And it took a picture of Will Powers! Phoenix: I have to ask him about that photograph! Maya: Oh well. Let's try again later. Examine Security guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. He must get pretty bored. I bet he's making funny faces at that camera. October 16Global StudiosEmployee Area Maya: Nick! This is where they do all the behind-the-scenes stuff! Hey! Look! There's Powers's dressing room! No one's here this soon after the murder I guess. Let's take a look around! Examine Bicycle Phoenix: Looks like one of those electric-powered bicycles. I dunno about these. I mean, what's the point? Maya: It makes it a lot easier to go up hills! Phoenix: Don't people cycle to get exercise!? Drain grate Phoenix: The metal grate on the drain here has been taken off. That's a pretty big drain. A kid could fit through there, I bet. Maya: Yeah, if you snuck in that way you wouldn't have to pay at the gate! Phoenix: Well, if you want to leave that way, be my guest. Maya: Right! Huh? Hey! I'm not a kid! Grate Phoenix: The grate that used to cover the drain. It's a little bent. I don't think it would fit if I tried to put it back on. Lunch table Phoenix: The remains of yesterday's lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak. Maya: Mmm! T-bone steak! That would have hit the spot. Phoenix: You just had a burger! Maya: Yeah, but I have a second stomach just for steaks. Phoenix: (What!?) Stage backdrop Phoenix: There's a half-finished backdrop for a stage here. Looks like a castle. Probably \"Neo Olde Tokyo Castle.\" Dressing room door Phoenix: The door to the dressing room. It's not locked. Maya: Hey, Nick! Let's take a look inside! Maybe we can find something as a souvenir...? Phoenix: What do you mean \"find\"!? Maya: You never know! There might be something like... the Samurai Spear! Phoenix: We don't need a spear! (And that's the murder weapon for crying out loud!) Dressing room sign Phoenix: There's a sign on the dressing room door. \"Mr. Will Powers\"... it must be neat to be the star and have your own room like this. Dressing room window Phoenix: A window into the dressing room. The glass is frosted, so I can't see inside. Storage room door Phoenix: That must be the storage room. That's where they keep all the film equipment. Maya: Wow, Nick! You know a lot about the industry! Phoenix: Umm, what else would they keep in a film studio? Vending machine Phoenix: Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks or something. Popcorn, at least! Maya: W-wait! Look! \"Samurai Soda\"! Nick! Try this! Phoenix: (Ladies first...) October 16Global StudiosDressing Room Phoenix: (Powers's dressing room... So this is where he was sleeping? Or at least, this is where he claims he was sleeping.) Maya: No one actually saw him taking a nap here, did they? Phoenix: Right, and there's a picture of him near the crime scene. (I hope he's telling the truth... for his sake!) Examine Cosmetics Phoenix: There's a vast array of cosmetics here. Maya: Ooh! This is the wig he used in \"Samurai Boogey-Woogey\"! Nick! Try this on! Phoenix: No. And how can you tell the name of a show just by looking at a wig!? Maya: I, um, kinda like samurai movies. Phoenix: (\"Kinda\"...?) Costume rack Phoenix: There's some regular suits in among the costumes here. Those must be his own clothes. Maya: It'd be fun to wear one of the costumes... Phoenix: (I'd say you were already wearing one, myself.) Couch Phoenix: Looks like someone was sleeping here. Maybe Powers did take a nap here yesterday... Mirror Phoenix: They always have mirrors like this in dressing rooms. I see my hair is still nice and spiky, just how I like it. Bag Maya: Hmm? This must be Powers's bag. Phoenix: Hey, don't open that. Maya: Look! Phoenix: An employee cardkey. That must be Powers's. It says \"Studio One.\" Maya: Let's take it, Nick! Phoenix: Borrow it. You mean borrow. Cardkey added to the Court Record. Bag (subsequent times) Maya: I wonder what else is inside Powers's bag...? Phoenix: Stop that! (My partner, the thief in training.) Table Phoenix: There's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Some tea and cookies... Maya: Nick... I'm hungry! Phoenix: You just had a burger! Maya: Yeah, but I have a separate stomach for sweets! Phoenix: (How many stomachs does this girl have!?) Window Phoenix: It's locked. Looks like he doesn't open his window much. I guess it is kind of dusty outside. Wright & Co. Law Offices Present Cardkey Maya: Oh, hey! That's the cardkey to get into Studio One where the murder took place! Let's go check it out! Studio - Main Gate Present Cardkey Phoenix: Could you tell me about this, ma'am? Oldbag: Oh that! Isn't that a studio cardkey? You better watch it! The scene of a murder is no place for sightseeing! I'll be taking that! Hand it over! Phoenix: W-wait! No, that's mine! Oldbag: Look, I don't have a cardkey to the studio, see? I want to go pay my respects to Jack Hammer where he died. Phoenix: W... well you'll just have to wait! Outside Studio One Examine Studio One entrance Phoenix: The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body. Maya: Let's go in and check it out, Nick! Phoenix: I wonder if this cardkey we borrowed from the dressing room will work... *beep* Phoenix: It opened! Maya: Alright! We're in! Phoenix: (She's way too happy for someone visiting a crime scene.) Present Cardkey Maya: Hey, Detective! Take a look at this! Gumshoe: Whazzat? Phoenix: Whoa whoa whoa! Don't show him that! He'll confiscate it! Maya: Aww... I just wanted to show it off. After examining Studio One entrance in Studio One Entrance: October 16Studio One Maya: ... Phoenix: What is it? Maya: ... Phoenix: You're real quiet all of a sudden. Maya: Doesn't it give you the shivers, Nick? That white tape! It's so... so real! Phoenix: Well, the Evil Magistrate did die here. And the Steel Samurai killed him. The murder weapon was the Samurai Spear. Sounds pretty real to me... Examine Director's chair Maya: Hey! Look! That's the chair the director sits in! I've always wanted to sit in one of these. Hey Nick, take a look at that. One of those black-and-white boards they clap at the start of filming! And look! A megaphone! A real live megaphone! Phoenix: ... Maya: Ready, Nick? Action! Phoenix: (This girl is more troubled than I thought...) Film camera Leads to: \"Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!\" Reflecting screen Maya: What's this? Phoenix: That's for reflecting light. They call it a reflecting screen or something like that. The assistant holds it during filming. Maya: Huh. Phoenix: What? Where's your enthusiasm for all things entertainment? Maya: Well, lighting is fine, but I'd want to be the director. Or maybe the Steel Samurai! Phoenix: (I think she's being serious...!) Stage backdrop Phoenix: Looks like a backdrop for a stage. This must be used in the Steel Samurai show. Maya: Of course! That's the mountain, Neo Fujiyama! Phoenix: Doesn't the Steel Samurai take place in Olde Tokyo? Can you even see Mt. Fuji from there? Maya: Not Olde Tokyo, Nick! \"Neo\" Olde Tokyo! Phoenix: Oh. Right. (Step)ladder Maya: Look, a ladder! Phoenix: That's a \"step\"-ladder. Maya: So? What's the difference? You need to stop judging things based on narrow-minded cultural assumptions, Nick! Phoenix: R-right... sorry. (This girl is OUT there!) Tape outline Phoenix: They outlined where Jack Hammer's body lay with tape. His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. I guess that's why the head part looks like a helmet. Funny, I expected a spear stabbing would leave at least a few bloodstains. I guess the costume must have absorbed most of it... Maya: Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton! Phoenix: Yeah! So don't touch it! Maya: Whoa! It's heavier than I thought... ???: Hey! You! No touching that! Phoenix: Ah, um, sorry, my partner is kind of, y'know... Maya: \"Y'know\"!? No I don't know! Phoenix: Umm... who are you? Penny: Who me? I'm an assistant here. I help with props and stuff. Moving them around, ordering new ones, et cetera. Maya: We're lawyers representing Mr. Will Powers. Penny: Oh, you're WP's people. Maya: \"WP\"...? Oh, Will Powers. W.P., I get it. Penny: I don't envy you guys one bit! But... do what you can for WP, okay? He'd never hurt a fly! He has to be innocent. Maya: Don't worry, leave it to us! Talk The day of the crime Phoenix: Could you tell me anything about the day of the murder? Penny: Yes. I was in the studio the whole day. I was the only assistant on staff that day, you see. Maya: Only one assistant!? Penny: Yes, well, the studios isn't doing so well right now. (Changed from [Yes, well, the studios aren't doing so well right now.] in the original release) And yesterday was only rehearsal for our action sequences. Maya: Oh, I see. (Changed from [I see. Neat!] in the original release) Penny: In the morning we went through the action sequences in the employee area. WP and Hammer were there, along with everyone else. Phoenix: The employee area--that's where Powers's dressing room is, right? Penny: Yes, that's the place. After eating lunch there, Mr. Hammer went to Studio One. Then I saw WP go into his dressing room. But I didn't see either of them after that. Will Powers Phoenix: Did you know that Mr. Powers was sleeping in his room? Penny: No! I wouldn't go in there unless I had some urgent message for him... I mean, it's his private... What kind of a girl do you think I am!? Phoenix: W-what kind...? No, no, I'm sure you're a fine girl. Um, sorry. (So much for getting a confirmation of Powers's alibi.) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, any thoughts about this? Penny: Sorry... I... don't really want to think too much about what happened just yet. After clearing all Talk options: Maya: What do we do, Nick? We haven't found anything. If WP was the only one who came to the studio... Then he has to be the killer! They even have a photograph... Phoenix: Hmm... Penny: Umm... Sorry... I know you're busy. Phoenix: Not really. Penny: Actually, there's been something bothering me. Maya: Ah hah! That's what I'm talking about! A clue! A lead! Penny: Well, I don't know about that, but that day, just after noon, I sensed someone was here... Phoenix: You \"sensed\"? Penny: Yes, several times. Phoenix: Some other studio employees, maybe? Penny: No, I don't think so. The only thing we had scheduled was an action scene run-through. I was the only assistant here that day. I have a feeling it was someone from... outside. Phoenix: R-really!? Maya: But wait, if someone had come in here... Wouldn't that security lady have noticed them? Phoenix: Yeah, you're right. Penny: I'm sorry I don't have any better information than that. Maya: No, thanks! That helps us a lot. Anything helps. Let's go put that security lady on the spot! Talk Sensing someone Phoenix: So you sensed that someone other than the regular film crew was in the studio? Penny: Yes... I think. Phoenix: (\"I think\" doesn't cut it in a witness testimony.) Maya: Nick! What about that security lady! If someone else came into the studio, she must have seen them! October 16Global StudiosMain Gate Oldbag: What? You're still here? Really! You look as though you've seen a ghost! Talk Assistant's claim Leads to: \"What? I saw that suspicious look on your face!\" Oldbag: What? I saw that suspicious look on your face! Phoenix: I wanted to ask you again about yesterday... You came here at 1:00 PM, correct? And the estimated time of Hammer's death was 2:30. Are you sure that Powers was the only one to go through here between those times? Oldbag: Sure as can be! Maya: But we have a witness who thinks there was \"someone from outside\" here that day. Oldbag: What!? Maya: Are you absolutely sure you were here watching the whole time? Oldbag: ... Maya: Ma'am? Oldbag: Who was it? Who told you that? Who dares question ME!? Maya: Eek! Oldbag: Alright you better tell me and tell me quick, you spiky-haired cretin! Someone's been complaining about the work I do, eh!? Maya: Uh... um, we were just talking to the assistant in Studio One. Oldbag: Her! She's not even a full-time employee! All you young'uns are like that nowadays, running your mouths like there was no tomorrow saying this that and the other thing. Well when I was young let me tell you we knew a thing or two about respecting our elders. Back then we did and it's a crying shame that you youths today just say what you please about poor old ladies Graaaaaaaaaaaawr! Phoenix: She left... Maya: Well, Nick? This is our chance to do what we can without her looking over our shoulders! Examine Computer Phoenix: The computer that runs the studio security cameras. Maya: Nick! Maybe we can see that photo of Powers with this computer! Phoenix: Yeah, maybe. (Should I try the computer?) Try it Phoenix: Okay. Let's give it a try. Maya: You know how to work these things, Nick? Phoenix: Looks like I just have to enter in a few numbers. Let's see... first, I need the date of the murder. (It looks like the camera turned on at 1:00 PM that day... 1:00... That was when the security lady arrived at the guard station.) [Please enter the number of the security camera.] ST1-703 Phoenix: There! Entered! Maya: ... ... Nothing happened. Phoenix: Huh? Maybe I got the number wrong. Maya: *sigh* Maybe we should go look at that camera again? Leads back to examination ST1-307 Leads to: \"There! Entered!\" ST1-370 Phoenix: There! Entered! Maya: ... ... Nothing happened. Phoenix: Huh? Maybe I got the number wrong. Maya: *sigh* Maybe we should go look at that camera again? Leads back to examination Leave it alone Phoenix: (Hmm... I'd better not fool around with this, or that security lady will get me. Maybe next time.) Maya: What? You're not going to look at it? Bo-ring! Leads back to examination Phoenix: There! Entered! ... Maya: Hey! It printed out the data for that day! Phoenix: Let's see what we got... ... Huh? Maya: How is this a picture of Will Powers? Phoenix: Well, he is the one who always wears that suit... I guess that's why the security lady thought it was him. Maya: I don't imagine the detective was very happy with this photo as evidence. Hmm? Something's printed on the back. Phoenix: Huh? [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2] Maya: What does that mean? Phoenix: Maybe there's more photo data from that day? Maya: Nope--that's the only one in the computer. Powers's{?} Photo added to the Court Record. Maya: Hey, hey, Nick! Can't we use this photo as evidence for the trial? Phoenix: Yeah. Maya: We'll put that security lady in her place with this! Phoenix: Right, we'll put her in her place... Maya: Hey, that's what I said! Anyway... Let's show her this photo and see what she says! Phoenix: Wait. Let's not. Maya: Why not? Phoenix: It's never a good idea to reveal your hand to the enemy too soon. Maya: Nick! You're craftier than I gave you credit for. Why, you could be the next... Evil Magistrate! Phoenix: Hey! Why do I have to be the villain. Maya: Relax, it was just a joke! So, are we done for today? Phoenix: I think this photo is what we needed for the trial. Still, it'd be better if we had some idea who the real killer was! Maybe it really is that security lady...? To be continued. Before selecting \"ST1-307\" upon examining computer in Global Studios - Main Gate: October 16Studio One Maya: No one's here. I wonder if the security lady got mad at that assistant? Phoenix: Hmm. That's definitely a possibility. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here. Turnabout Samurai Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 Part 5 Part 6 October 18, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4 Judge: The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers. Edgeworth: The prosecution is ready, Your Honor. Phoenix: The defense is ready, Your Honor. Judge: Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please. Edgeworth: The prosecution will show the court that at 2:30 PM on October 15, the defendant, Mr. Will Powers, killed fellow actor Jack Hammer at Studio One of Global Studios. It is impossible for anyone else to have committed this heinous crime. The evidence presented during the trial will all point to this fact. Judge: Hmm. I see. Very well, I would like to move on to your testimony. Mr. Edgeworth, the prosecution may call its first witness. Edgeworth: Very well, I call a most familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand. (Changed from [First, I would like to call a familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand.] in the original release) Edgeworth: Detective, if you would briefly describe this case to the court? Gumshoe: Yes sir! I'll explain with the guidemap here. To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see? This here is the Employee Area. The actors did a run-through of their action scenes during the morning here. This is the main gate to the studios. The security lady that works at the studios was here at 1:00 PM on that day. Past the security station there is a gate, see? Past that are the studios. And here it is... Studio One. This is the scene of the murder, where the body was found! Now, on the day of the murder, October 15, there were only three people here. The victim, Jack Hammer, the defendant, Will Powers, and a young woman, the production assistant. All the production staff were in the Employee Area until noon. Then after lunch, the victim, Jack Hammer, went to Studio One. Right after that, at 1:00 PM, the security lady got to the guard station. Now, jump ahead to later that day... 5:00 PM. The production staff came to Studio One to perform a rehearsal. Needless to say, the rehearsal was cancelled... The time of death was 2:30 PM. The \"Samurai Spear\" found lodged in the victim's chest was the murder weapon. That's the case, in brief. Anyone like to hear that again? Phoenix: (Hmm... should I listen to that whole thing again...?) Skip it Leads to: \"I think I can probably remember that...\" Listen again Phoenix: I'm sorry, could you describe that one more time? Gumshoe: I shoulda known it would be you, pal! Fine. Once more for the mentally-challenged lawyer. Phoenix: (Yeah, yeah. Live it up while you can, Gumshoe.) Leads back to: \"To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see?\" Phoenix: (I think I can probably remember that...) Judge: So the murder weapon was a \"spear\"? How... medieval! Samurai Spear added to the Court Record. Edgeworth: Your Honor. This case is quite simple if you ask one question: And that question is: \"What did the security lady at the guard station see?\" Judge: Understood. Edgeworth: Let's call this security officer to the stand! Edgeworth: Will the witness declare her name? Oldbag: ... Hmm? My, aren't you a handsome fellow! I'm afraid I'm a bit flustered! Edgeworth: Y-your name, please! Oldbag: Oh, dearie! No need for you to be embarrassed! Just call me \"grandma.\" Edgeworth: YOUR NAME, PLEASE! Phoenix: (Seems Edgeworth has a bit of trouble getting his witnesses to say their names...) Oldbag: Wendy Oldbag, dearie. So just call me \"grandma.\" It's practically my name! So even when I was young I was an Oldbag, but not really that was just my name dearie. Still how the other children would make fun of me and just because of my name can you believe it? But there was this boy, the captain of the chess club in junior high, and when he called me an old bag well I just cried and cried because I had a crush on him you see-- Edgeworth: Edgeworth: O-objection! I... object to the witness's talkativeness. Judge: Objection sustained! The witness will refrain from rambling on the stand. Oldbag: I was just getting to the good part, dearie! Edgeworth: Perhaps we can get to the testimony? Judge: Now, the witness was stationed at the main gate on the day of the murder, correct? Oldbag: Yessey I was. Judge: And to get to the scene of the murder, someone would have to pass by you? Oldbag: You know your stuff, dearie! Judge: ... You may begin your testimony. Phoenix: (She sure is one hell of an Oldbag...) Witness Testimony -- Witness's Account -- Oldbag: On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM. Poor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning. I, well, I had some errands to run that morning. Anyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station. I was at the main gate from then until 5:00! Now, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right? Interesting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM. It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio! Judge: You saw the defendant, then? Hmm... Very well. Let's begin the cross-examination. Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. Cross Examination -- Witness's Account -- Oldbag: On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So up until that time, anyone who wanted to could go into the studio? Oldbag: Well, there wasn't a security guard at the gate, no. But the main gate was locked, dearie. You'd need an employee cardkey to get in. Phoenix: (Right... the cardkey that I have. So, what she's saying is no one who wasn't supposed to be there could get in.) Edgeworth: Was there anyone at the studios when you arrived at the guard station? Oldbag: Poor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: A \"run-through\"...? Oldbag: They were working out a scene between the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate. They got the basics figured out by noon, and were to use the afternoon for practice. Rehearsal was supposed to start at 5:00. That's why poor old Hammer went to Studio One in the afternoon. Phoenix: (So Powers was in his dressing room sleeping... when he was supposed to be practicing! Talk about a laid-back hero...) Edgeworth: If there was a run-through in the morning, why did you only get there after noon? Oldbag: I, well, I had some errands to run that morning. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What kind of \"errands\"? Oldbag: Oh, well, you know. Phoenix: Answer the question! Oldbag: Actually... I was watching poor Hammer and Powers. Observing, you know? Phoenix: O-observing? Weren't you supposed to be at the guard station? Oldbag: Whippersnapper! I told you I locked the gate, didn't I? I did my job! Phoenix: (I'm not sure your boss would see it that way...) Oldbag: Anyway! I always watch Hammer's run-throughts. Always! Never missed one in all my years. Maya: Wow! I want to see a Steel Samurai run-through too! Phoenix: You could quit being a spirit medium and take up guard duty. Maya: Not a bad idea... Oldbag: Anyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Did you see the victim then? Oldbag: Did I see poor old Hammer? Nope. He'd already gone to the studio before I got back to the guard station. Edgeworth: Tell us what happened next. Oldbag: I was at the main gate from then until 5:00! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you were watching there the WHOLE time? No breaks? Not even a second? Oldbag: O-of course! I am a professional, you know! Our are you criticizing how I do my job!? Whippersnapper! Phoenix: No, it's just, after seeing you eating those donuts in the guard station yesterday... Oldbag: I can watch the gate and eat donuts at the same time! Snipperwhapper! Maya: \"Snipperwhapper\"...? Old windbag is losing it, Nick. Phoenix: Why don't you raise an objection? Judge: So, the witness was on duty through the afternoon, the whole time. Very well. What did you see? Oldbag: Now, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right? Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How did you know that? Oldbag: Oh hoh hoh. I have my ways! That over-dressed young detective told me. I fed him some donuts and he talked and talked... If you ask me, that detective isn't cut out for his job. Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: (Poor Detective Gumshoe, getting chewed out by a security guard...) Oldbag: Interesting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: 2:00? You're sure? Oldbag: Sure as spit! Judge: Well, who was the man!? Oldbag: Really, you should try not to get so excited at your age. You might strain something. Judge: ... Oldbag: Now, now, don't get your skivvies all in a bunch. I'll tell you who it was! Present Powers's(?) Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag!\" Oldbag: It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you saw Mr. Powers? Oldbag: That's what I said! Got wax in your ears, sonny? Maya: Nick, this is your chance! Phoenix: Yeah, time to pull out the secret weapon... Oldbag: I'll say it again! It was him! Present Powers's(?) Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag!\" Maya: Nick... Doesn't she seem like she's enjoying this a little too much? Phoenix: Windbags love gossiping about other people's misfortunes. Maya: Ugh. Can't she get her kicks somewhere else? Phoenix: Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag! You've been saying since yesterday that you \"saw Mr. Powers,\" correct? But you're talking about the man in this photo, aren't you! Judge: J-just a moment, Mr. Wright. Let me see that photo! ... What is this, exactly? Phoenix: None other than the Steel Samurai, defender of Neo Olde Tokyo. Ms. Oldbag! Is this the \"Mr. Powers\" that you saw!? Oldbag: Of course! Didn't your momma teach you any sense, sonny? Anyone can plainly see that's Powers! Right? Edgeworth: No, they can't! (Changed from [Um, yeah.] in the original release) ... Umm... well. I mean, I wonder? (Changed from [Umm... well. I wonder?] in the original release) Phoenix: True, Mr. Powers does play the role of the Steel Samurai! But that doesn't mean Mr. Powers IS the Steel Samurai! Oldbag: ...! I... I know that! I wasn't born yesterday! Judge: No one in this court is accusing you of that, Ms... er, witness. Phoenix: (He's having trouble calling her \"Oldbag\" apparently...) Judge: However, you do not have proof that the person in this photo is Mr. Will Powers, do you? Oldbag: Humph! Nosy old man! Of course I have proof! Phoenix: What!? Edgeworth: Huh!? Phoenix: (Even Edgeworth is surprised!?) Edgeworth: The prosecution would like to ask the old... the witness. Please make known all the information in your possession ahead of time! Oldbag: How was I to know everyone would be so nosy! You should be ashamed, all of you! Anyway, I showed that photo to the young detective. He told me \"this isn't any good as evidence, pal.\" He didn't even give it a second look! Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: (Wow, old windbag has left even Edgeworth speechless. She's good!) Judge: Let's hear about your proof, then. Witness Testimony -- The Man in the Photo -- Oldbag: I never say anything I don't mean, mind you! That morning, during the run-through of the action scene... I saw Powers trip and fall! He broke one of the props, it was a big mess. Apparently, he sprained his ankle pretty bad. Now, look at that picture! You can see he's dragging his leg! See? Clear as day! That's how I knew it was Powers. Happy? Judge: Hmm. So he had sprained his ankle...? Very well. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness. Phoenix: (She's got to be hiding something... I'll press her until she squeals.) Cross Examination -- The Man in the Photo -- Oldbag: I never say anything I don't mean, mind you! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Umm... Oldbag: Whippersnapper! Phoenix: (Hey, I haven't said anything yet!) Oldbag: I'll have you know I'm not pointing fingers at anyone behind their backs! Everything I've said is on the straight and narrow! The up and up! Youth today! Always whining about each other, pointing fingers this way and that! It's enough to make an old lady want to cry... Edgeworth: Mr. Wright! Please, for all our sakes, try not to upset the witness! Phoenix: (I think Edgeworth has met his match...) Oldbag: That morning, during the run-through of the action scene... Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Who was present at the run-through? Oldbag: Well, let's see... There was Powers, he's the Steel Samurai... Then poor old Hammer, the Evil Magistrate. And... me. Judge: And what exactly were you doing? Oldbag: Observing! Just... observing. Phoenix: What about the assistant? Oldbag: Oh, she was off moving backdrops around and such. Phoenix: (So she didn't see the run-through, then...) Oldbag: I saw Powers trip and fall! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Trip and fall\"...? Oldbag: Yes! And to think, he's supposed to be the Steel Samurai! What a laugh! So Powers sprained his ankle. I helped make it better for him, of course. Judge: You... helped make it better? Oldbag: I kissed it where it hurt. Judge: L-let's just skip over that part, shall we? Phoenix: Where was the assistant then? Oldbag: Oh, her? She was cleaning up backdrops, I think. She didn't know about Powers's ankle. Phoenix: (Hmm...) Edgeworth: You may continue your testimony. Oldbag: He broke one of the props, it was a big mess. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: He broke a prop? Oldbag: Sure did! His own Samurai Spear. Phoenix: (His Samurai Spear... the murder weapon!?) Oldbag: Luckily I was there with my duct tape to fix it. Phoenix: (This strikes me as a significant detail... I'd better write this down in the Court Record.) Samurai Spear updated in the Court Record. Press (subsequent times) Phoenix: Phoenix: He broke a prop? Oldbag: Sure did! His own Samurai Spear. Phoenix: (His Samurai Spear... the murder weapon!?) Oldbag: Luckily I was there with my duct tape to fix it. Phoenix: (This strikes me as a significant detail...) Oldbag: Apparently, he sprained his ankle pretty bad. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Was Mr. Power's [sic] ankle badly sprained? Oldbag: Not so bad that he couldn't walk around. He went to his dressing room to rest up after lunch. Phoenix: (Thus the nap...) Oldbag: Anyway, I saw him dragging his foot when he walked. Phoenix: (Dragging his foot... okay.) Oldbag: You can see he's dragging his leg! See? Clear as day! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you absolutely sure? (Let's take a look at that picture again... Hmm... so he was walking strangely because he was injured...) Judge: Hmm. It does look like he was dragging his foot. Oldbag: See! And you didn't trust me! Whippersnapper! Oldbag: That's how I knew it was Powers. Happy? Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Still, you can't look at this and say it's Mr. Powers! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Yes, but only Mr. Powers would have been dragging his leg! Judge: He has a point. It does seem quite likely that it was Powers. Phoenix: (There's got to be more to this. I'd better keep pressing her.) Maya: Well, Nick? Find any glaring contradictions? Phoenix: Well, she seems pretty sure that was Powers in that photo... I guess I'll just press her and see if I can shake her conviction... After pressing second or third statement, then pressing fourth statement: Edgeworth: I think we've heard enough! Haven't we, Your Honor? Judge: Well, there is one thing that bothers me. Edgeworth: Which is? Judge: Where is this \"Steel Samurai\" costume now? Edgeworth: Umm... hmm. Actually, well... We couldn't find it. We're looking, though. Judge: Hmm... Edgeworth: Anyway, that's not important! The witness did see the Steel Samurai, yes. And it is clear that the person in the Steel Samurai suit was Mr. Will Powers! Judge: Hmm... I suppose that's right. Phoenix: (Are you sure you're sure, Your Honor?) Object Phoenix: Hold it right there! We keep talking possibilities, but we have to agree that this photo shows the Steel Samurai! Nowhere in this photo can we see Mr. Will Powers! Judge: Hmm... The defense has a point. I also wonder if someone else not caught on camera could have killed Mr. Hammer. We have to consider that possibility, also. Edgeworth: Then allow me to remove that doubt from your mind, Your Honor... Leads to: \"Will the witness continue her testimony, please?\" Wait and see what happens Phoenix: (I think I'll wait and see where this goes.) Judge: I suppose, since there weren't any additional crew members at the studios that day... It's quite likely that it was the defendant inside that costume. I see no problem with this evidence. Edgeworth: Most perceptive, Your Honor! Phoenix: (He still doesn't seem that convinced to me... I hope.) Leads to: \"Will the witness continue her testimony, please?\" Edgeworth: Will the witness continue her testimony, please? Oldbag: No need to ask twice! Witness Testimony -- Witness's Account, cont. -- Oldbag: The time of poor Hammer's death was 2:30 PM, true? The only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers! No one else went there! If they had, I would have seen them! Judge: Hmm... So, if no one else went to the studio... Then it would have to be this \"Steel Samurai\" who did it. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness. Cross Examination -- Witness's Account, cont. -- Oldbag: The time of poor Hammer's death was 2:30 PM, true? Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How do you know that? Oldbag: Eh? Didn't I just explain? I gave donuts to the young detective. And the, after some rubbish about it being a \"secret, pal\" he told me everything. Phoenix: (I see Detective Gumshoe shares his fellow officer's fondness for donuts.) Oldbag: The only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you absolutely sure!? Oldbag: Oh, quite, quite, sonny. Nobody suspicious lookin' passed by at all. Phoenix: (Nobody suspicious lookin'... Right.) Present Powers's(?) Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"Hold on!\" Oldbag: No one else went there! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What about before you got to the guard station? Oldbag: You mean before 1:00? Why, everyone was in the Employee Area before then. And I locked the main gate so no one could get in. Not to mention... Present Powers's(?) Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"Hold on!\" Oldbag: If they had, I would have seen them! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you sure!? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The witness has answered the question! Anyone going into the studio had to pass by the witness! Oldbag: That's right, sonny! You let 'em have it, Edgey-boy! Phoenix: (E-Edgey-boy...?) Edgeworth: ... Present Powers's(?) Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"Hold on!\" Maya: Old windbag sure has balls! Or... well, you know what I mean. Phoenix: Old windbags have a way of skipping over important details, after all... Or, for that matter, entirely forgetting them. Maya: How convenient. Phoenix: (Something for you to look forward to, perhaps?) Phoenix: Hold on! Look at this photograph one more time. This photo was taken by the camera at the gate for the studios, correct? Oldbag: Yesiree, sonny. Phoenix: So, whenever anyone passes by here, it automatically takes a picture? Oldbag: And here I thought you didn't know your head from a hole in the ground. Phoenix: Right... Anyway! It's also true that the computer in the guard station records all security cam data. Oldbag: Ooh! You know, if you wanted to work at the studio, we might have an opening. Phoenix: That very computer printed out this photo. Note that on the back of the photo are printed the words: [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2] Oldbag: Even I know that means it was taken at 2:00 PM on October the 15th! Really, sonny! Phoenix: Actually, I knew that too. The issure here is the bit at the end where it says: \"Photo #2\"... Oldbag: \"Photo #2\"...? Phoenix: The computer only held data for one photo on that day. Don't you think that's odd? Shouldn't this photo be \"Photo #1\" if it really was the ONLY photo!? Judge: Order! Order! Please tell the court what you mean by this, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Actually, that's what I want to ask the witness. This evidence shows that not one, but two people went to the studio that day. Yet there is only data for one of the photos! Who could have erased the data for the other photo? Only someone with access-- the security lady herself! (Changed from [Only someone with access... the security lady herself!] in the original release) Oldbag: Eh!? You watch your mouth, whippersnapper! The only person I saw that day was Will Powers! Phoenix: But the camera on the gate fired twice! That means two people went by! Oldbag: Umm... well, yes... that's what it would seem to mean... Judge: Can the witness explain this to the court? Oldbag: Umm... ahem. I-I don't understand these new-fangled computer things... Umm... E-Edgey-boy! Help! Edgeworth: Huh!? B-believe me, I want to, but I don't know what this means either. Oldbag: Humph! Some help you are! You're a whippersnapper too! ... ... Whippersnapper...? Judge: Something the matter, Ms. Oldbag? Oldbag: Ah! That's right! I... I just remembered something! Judge: Let me guess... Someone else passed by the gate... someone other than the Steel Samurai? Oldbag: Er... well, yes, I suppose you could put it that way. Judge: *sigh* I see. Your testimony, please. Witness Testimony -- The Other Person -- Oldbag: Every day, after I finish my guard duties, I have one other important job to do. I go through the photos recorded on the security computer and check them. I throw out any photos that aren't suspicious lookin', you see. Come to think of it, now I remember throwing out one photo that day! Edgeworth: M-Ms. Oldbag! This is the first I've heard of this! Oldbag: Well, of course, sonny! I've only just remembered it. Judge: Right... anyway, Mr. Wright, please begin the cross-examination. Maya: Well, I'd say this was a turn for the unexpected, but I kind of expected this... Cross Examination -- The Other Person -- Oldbag: Every day, after I finish my guard duties, I have one other important job to do. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Another \"job\"? Oldbag: T-that's right. I check all the people that passed by the main gate that day. I look closely at every one of the photos that security camera takes. Edgeworth: Do you backup all of the security camera data? Oldbag: Well, they keep telling me too, yes. But those computers are just so frustrating. Oldbag: I go through the photos recorded on the security computer and check them. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How many photos are there, usually? Oldbag: On a day when we're open to the public, we get more than 500 people. But on filming days or rehearsal days... well, we don't have much money. We never get more than 50, and that's a big day. Edgeworth: Do you backup all of the security camera data? Oldbag: Well, they keep telling me too, yes. But those computers are just so frustrating. Oldbag: I throw out any photos that aren't suspicious lookin', you see. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How exactly do you determine what isn't \"suspicious lookin'\"? Oldbag: Oh, you can tell by looking at their faces. For the most part. Phoenix: F-for the most part? This is a murder trial, Ms. Oldbag! Oldbag: Well, I didn't touch that suspicious lookin' Will Powers's photo, did I? Phoenix: (I think she's missing the point.) Oldbag: Come to think of it, now I remember throwing out one photo that day! Press Phoenix: Leads to: \"Well, who in the heck was in that photo you erased!?\" Maya: \"Come to think of it\"? Couldn't she think of that a little earlier!? Phoenix: Classic old windbag maneuver, Maya. Maya: Hmm... Might be a useful tactic to remember for use in my future career as a windbag. Phoenix: (Let's find out more about this \"erased\" photo.) Phoenix: Well, who in the heck was in that photo you erased!? Oldbag: Humph. A fanboy. Phoenix: F-fanboy? Oldbag: Steel Samurai fanboys. Real freaks, if you ask me. They get information about the rehearsals from gosh-knows-where. They're always hanging about. One was there that day. Phoenix: Phoenix: W-wait a second! Didn't you just say no one else could get in!? \"I locked the main gate so no one could get in\"... Those were your words! Oldbag: Well! If you must know, there's a drain that goes into the Employee Area. The grate has been loose for a while. It leads outside, and well, that's where they come in. Phoenix: They come in through the drain? Oldbag: I told you they were freaks. Oh, and... Phoenix: And...? Oldbag: They're kids. Children. Whippersnappers. Phoenix: K-kids!? So, on the photo that you erased...? Oldbag: It was a boy. Probably 2nd or 3rd grade. Phoenix: Whaaaaaaaaaaaat!? Judge: O-order! Order! Let me get this straight. You saw two people pass by the gate on their way to the studios that day? One was the Steel Samurai, dragging his leg. The other was a boy who looked to be in about 2nd or 3rd grade? Oldbag: Oh yes, well we see his type there every day. Can't stop 'em. Can't catch 'em. Edgeworth: A boy in 2nd or 3rd grade? Hmm... I assume it would be hard, if not impossible for a young boy to wield the Samurai Spear? Judge: Impossible, I'd think. It's quite heavy. Oldbag: Right! As I said, I didn't pay him much mind. That's why I erased the data. Maya: Um, Nick? What's going on? I mean, the boy was there, that makes him a suspect! Phoenix: Yeah, and they're already trying to \"un-suspect\" him. Judge: This court will take a five-minute recess. (Changed from [I'd like to take a five minute recess.] in the original release) I want the defense and the prosecution to consider this new information... And no forgetting vital information this time! October 18, 11:08 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3 Phoenix: Mr. WP? Will: Y-yes? Phoenix: Tell me straight: were you really in your dressing room? You didn't go to the studio? Will: I-I didn't go to the studio! I was s-sleeping, honest. Maya: So who was the \"Steel Samurai\" in that security photo? Will: How should I know? The Steel Samurai costume was off in the corner of the dressing room. Anyone could have walked in and taken it, really. Maya: What!? You should take better care of that stuff! Will: I couldn't imagine anyone would want to steal a Steel Samurai costume! So... where does this leave me? Phoenix: It doesn't look good... Will: *sniff* Phoenix: You're the only likely suspect, right now. Maya: Nick! W-what are we going to do!? Phoenix: First, we play for more time. We'll start targeting someone else that could conceivably have done this! Maya: Right! And it'll take them so long to shoot us down that we can get another day! Phoenix: Right... but if we pick the wrong person, we might lose on the spot. Will: You... don't sound very optimistic. Phoenix: I'm not optimistic at all, actually. Maya: Hey, Nick. It's time. Phoenix: Okay. Let's go. *sigh* Will: What does that mean... Please don't sigh like that! *sniff* Judge: Court will now reconvene for the trial of Mr. Will Powers. (Changed from [The court will now reconvene for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.] in the original release) Mr. Edgeworth, will you present the prosecution's thoughts on this matter? Edgeworth: The prosecution's thoughts are simple. Nothing has changed. The other person who went to the studios was a boy of roughly 10 years of age. The photo we do have may not be hard evidence... But there is still no one else that could have committed this crime! I call for a verdict of \"guilty\" for the defendant, Mr. Will Powers! Judge: Hmm... Very well. Mr. Wright, your thoughts? Phoenix: The defense disagrees with the prosecution's claim. There IS another person who could have committed this crime! Judge: Order! Interesting... Let us hear who you have in mind! However... Be aware that this court does not look kindly on accusing the innocent. If you accuse someone who is obviously innocent, you will be penalized. Phoenix: (Right. Great. As if the stakes weren't high enough.) Judge: So, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder? The assistant girl Phoenix: It was the assistant! The Steel Samurai costume was in his dressing room. She stole it, and in doing so she became the Steel Samurai! Judge: So you're saying the Steel Samurai in the picture is really the assistant? Phoenix: That's correct, Your Honor! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: If you're serious, you've got guts, Mr. Wright. Remember the photo? Wasn't the Steel Samurai a little lame!? He was dragging his foot! Phoenix: Oh. (Uh oh. Bad feeling time.) Edgeworth: Remember the testimony concerning Powers's injury!!! Oldbag: Powers and poor Hammer were at the run-through. Oh, and me. Phoenix: What about the assistant? Oldbag: Oh, her? She was cleaning up backdrops, I think. She didn't know about Powers's ankle. Edgeworth: The assistant knew nothing of Mr. Power's injury! She could look the Steel Samurai look with that costume... But she couldn't walk the the Steel Samurai walk! She wouldn't have limped! Phoenix: Ungh! Maya: That kind of takes the legs out from under that case... Judge: Mr. Wright. I'm afraid I have to penalize you, as I warned. Phoenix: (Nobody knows... the trouble I've seen...) Judge: May we move on, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: (Grr... this fight isn't over yet!) If you would, Your Honor, one more chance, please. Judge: Very well. Go ahead. Leads back to: \"So, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder?\" The grade-school boy Phoenix: It was the grade-school boy! ... ... ... Why isn't anyone saying anything? Edgeworth: Bah! Are you seriously suggesting the boy did it, Mr. Wright!? \"Grade-school boy kills veteran action star with spear!\" For one thing, it was the Steel Samurai holding the murder weapon. Would you care to explain just how the boy was involved? Phoenix: (Hmm... maybe that was a dumb move on my part.) Maya: \"Maybe\"? \"Maybe\"!? How about \"absolutely,\" Nick! Judge: Mr. Wright. I'm afraid I have to penalize you, as I warned. Phoenix: (Nobody knows... the trouble I've seen...) Judge: May we move on, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: (Grr... this fight isn't over yet!) If you would, Your Honor, one more chance, please. Judge: Very well. Go ahead. Leads back to: \"So, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder?\" The security lady Leads to: \"It was the security lady! Wendy Oldbag!\" Phoenix: It was the security lady! Wendy Oldbag! Oldbag: W-who!? Phoenix: The Steel Samurai is dragging his leg in this picture. That means whoever was in the suit knew about that morning's injury. Maybe because... they had been watching the action scene run-through! There was only one person other than Powers and Hammer who knew about the injury. The security lady, Oldbag! Oldbag: W-what!? Whippersnapper! Judge: Order! Order! I-is this true, Oldbag!? Oldbag: Oldbag!? That's Ms. Oldbag to you! Phoenix: Ms. Oldbag was standing guard alone at the main gate. She was by herself... in other words, she has no alibi! She could have briefly left her post to steal the the Steel Samurai costume... Then slipped into Studio One, the scene of the murder! Judge: W-why would she go through the trouble of wearing the Steel Samurai costume!? Phoenix: Simple, Your Honor. She knew the camera at the gate would take her picture. If she was in his costume, she could point the finger at Mr. Powers! Judge: I see! Excellent deductive reasoning, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Ohhh yeah, right here! Sherlock Holmes II, baby!) ...? (That's odd. Isn't this the part where Edgeworth pounces...? Doesn't he usually jump up with an objection and some new damning evidence...?) Judge: Well, Mr. Edgeworth? Does the prosecution have an opinion on this matter? Edgeworth: ... The prosecution has no meaningful objections at this time. Oldbag: W-w-what!? What's that supposed to mean!? Oh, so you all think I did it? Is that it!? Edgey-boy! Don't just sit there, do something! Phoenix: (What's my move? Maybe now's my chance to take this the whole way?) Press further Leads to: \"The very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case...\" Give granny a break Phoenix: (I guess this does kind of make it look like she's the killer. Funny, I feel bad for her all of a sudden.) Judge: Hmm... It's true that the witness could conceivably have committed this crime. Yet we must not forget that the victim was an action hero. As formidable as her personality may be, I doubt she'd be strong enough. Phoenix: (Uh oh! If he removes her from consideration, that means Mr. Powers is it! Sorry, windbag... but I don't have a choice.) Leads to: \"The very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case...\" Phoenix: The very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case... can be used to cast doubt on Ms. Oldbag's actions on that day! Oldbag: B-but why would I do something so horrible to poor Hammer!? Phoenix: You forget that Mr. Powers lacks a clear motive, too. Judge: Hmm... Indeed. Phoenix: (That did it. Now windbag is one of the suspects. No hard feelings... I hope.) Oldbag: Wait just a minute! What about the other person who went to the studio!? The boy! The one whose photo I erased! Judge: He's only a grade schooler though, as you said. 2nd or 3rd grade, was it? Oldbag: Th-that doesn't matter! When I was that age, I could pin my old man in 10 seconds, tops! Judge: Hmm... Your thoughts, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: That boy is not the killer. Oldbag: What!? How can you be so sure! Oh, or is it be nice to the kids and mean to your elders day? Whippersnapper! Phoenix: I have proof. Oldbag: P-proof!? Judge: Indeed? Then let's see this proof, Mr. Wright. You have proof that shows the boy could not have committed this murder? Present Cardkey Phoenix: Phoenix: The scene of the murder, as we all know, was Studio One. However, you need a cardkey to enter Studio One! How could a boy with no formal relation to the studios have a cardkey!? Leads to: \"I see!\" Present Powers's(?) Photo or Samurai Spear Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! The murder weapon was the Samurai Spear. That very spear is shown here in this photo. How could the boy have taken the spear? It's impossible! Leads to: \"I see!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This is my proof! Judge: ... I can't see how that has anything to do with this matter, Mr. Wright? Mr. Wright. There aren't that many pieces of evidence in the Court Record. Please try not to pick the wrong ones! Phoenix: S-sorry, Your Honor. Judge: I'll ask again, Mr. Wright. Leads back to: \"You have proof that shows the boy could not have committed this murder?\" Judge: I see! Well, would the witness care to comment on this? Oldbag: Mrph. Phoenix: (The windbag... speechless. This has got to be a first.) Judge: Very well! This court will suspend proceedings on the current trial for today. Mr. Edgeworth, please find out more about your witness, Ms. Windy... what was her name? Edgeworth: Something \"Oldbag,\" Your Honor. Judge: Then the prosecution will look further into this Oldbag before we continue! That is all. The court is adjourned! Oldbag: W-wait a second! I'm not going to just sit here while you run off barking up the wrong tree... me! I'm talking! Maya: Oh, great, stop the presses! The windbag wants to talk! Judge: Ms. Oldbag! What is this all about? Have you omitted something from your testimony? Oldbag: Actually, if you must know, there's something I was told not to talk about. Phoenix: N-not to talk about? Edgeworth: By whom!? Phoenix: (Huh? You mean it wasn't Edgeworth who told her not to talk...?) Judge: W-well, testify! Witness Testimony -- My Lips Were Sealed -- Oldbag: Global Studios wanted me to keep quiet about something. There were... some other people at the studios on the day of the murder. They said they had \"nothing to do with it,\" see? So they told me to just pretend they \"hadn't been at the studios that day.\" But if you're going to go accusing me, I'm not letting them get away scot free! Judge: M-Ms. Oldbag! This is crucial information! Why did you keep this from the court until now!? Oldbag: Ain't you been listening? They told me to shut my trap, and I always do what I'm told. Judge: ... Phoenix: (No, this isn't a bad dream, Your Honor. Witness the power of the Oldbag...) Judge: Mr. Wright... Your cross-examination. Cross Examination -- My Lips Were Sealed -- Oldbag: Global Studios wanted me to keep quiet about something. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, you were told not to talk? Oldbag: That's right! By the studio and TV bigwigs, no less! Edgeworth: Why didn't I hear about this!? Oldbag: Don't be too hard on yourself, sonny. We were all in on it. Oldbag: There were... some other people at the studios on the day of the murder. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: W-who were these people!? Oldbag: Well, the director and the producer, for starters... Phoenix: The... director? Edgeworth: We should have known something was fishy! How could they have done a run-through of their action scene without a director? Of course! Oldbag: Yes, well, I was surprised no one asked about it. Phoenix: So, where were these people? Oldbag: The director was in the Employee Area all morning for the run-through. He joined the producer around lunchtime and they had a meeting after that. Edgeworth: Where! Oldbag: Oh, in the Studio Two trailer. Phoenix: S-Studio Two...!? (There was a Studio Two...?) Oldbag: Well, if you look at the guidemap... Here it is. You go through the gate and all the way to the left. Phoenix: (The path where the monkey's head was fallen over.) Judge: Well, Mr. Wright... Would you like to continue the cross-examination...? Phoenix: (I think I've already asked all my questions, but...) Continue cross-examination Leads back to cross-examination Take a break Leads to: \"Your Honor.\" Oldbag: They said they had \"nothing to do with it,\" see? Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Ms. Oldbag! This is a trial for murder! Oldbag: I know that, silly! Still, they were pretty convincing about having nothing to do with it. And... they gave me a little bonus on the side. Phoenix: (So, you got your \"bonus\" and you still talked... Hmm. I think I've asked all the questions I have to ask...) Continue cross-examination Phoenix: (I guess there's no harm in getting as much info as I can!) Leads back to cross-examination Take a break Leads to: \"Your Honor.\" Oldbag: So they told me to just pretend they \"hadn't been at the studios that day.\" Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So they were actually in the studio!? Oldbag: Yes, the whole day. When they heard about the murder, they beat it before the cops came. Edgeworth: *grumble* (I'll kill this woman, I swear it...) Phoenix: (I feel sorry for Edgeworth, almost. She really left him hanging on this one.) Oldbag: But if you're going to go accusing me, I'm not letting them get away scot free! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Them\"...? W-who were these people!? Oldbag: Well, the director and the producer, for starters... Phoenix: The... director? Edgeworth: We should have known something was fishy! How could they have done a run-through of their action scene without a director? Of course! Oldbag: Yes, well, I was surprised no one asked about it. Phoenix: So, where were these people? Oldbag: The director was in the Employee Area all morning for the run-through. He joined the producer around lunchtime and they had a meeting after that. Edgeworth: Where! Oldbag: Oh, in the Studio Two trailer. Phoenix: S-Studio Two...!? (There was a Studio Two...?) Oldbag: Well, if you look at the guidemap... Here it is. You go through the gate and all the way to the left. Phoenix: (The path where the monkey's head was fallen over.) Judge: Well, Mr. Wright... Would you like to continue the cross-examination...? Phoenix: (I think I've already asked all my questions, but...) Continue cross-examination Leads back to cross-examination Take a break Leads to: \"Your Honor.\" Maya: Nick! I guess pressing her was the right thing to do! For an old windbag, she sure likes keeping secrets... Let's get as much information as we can! Phoenix: Your Honor. We have learned there were others at Global Studios on the day in question. The director and the producer and, er, some bigwigs, were all present. Yet, as we stand here, they have not been questioned! I hold that it is impossible to declare a verdict on the defendant, Mr. Powers! Judge: Hmm... The court acknowledges the defense's point. The prosecution will gather more information about the witness, Ms. Oldbag... and more information about these other people we have just been told of! Edgeworth: ... I understand, Your Honor. Judge: This ends the day's proceedings in the trial of Mr. Will Powers. That is all. The court is adjourned! October 18, 1:04 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3 Will: Th-thank you so much, Mr. Wright. I was right to ask you to defend me. Maya: Aww, really, it's nothing. *grin* Oh, or should I... *sniff* Phoenix: We'll be going down to the studios to do some more investigation. We have to find out more about this director and producer. They'll be turning up in the next trial as witnesses for certain. So now's my chance to get material for the cross-examination! Maya: So, Nick... Have we figured out just who it was in that Steel Samurai costume? Could it really have been old windbag? Phoenix: What do you think, Mr. Powers? Will: I don't think it was her, really. Maya: Neither do I, Nick. Phoenix: Y-yeah, I know! Look, I was just buying time back there. Someone had to be the bad guy for a bit to take the pressure off Mr. Powers. Maya: Poor old windbag... I feel kinda sorry for her. Phoenix: Well, she wasn't winning any points in there, with or without my accusation. Okay, let's get down to the studios. Maya: Right! We'll be back to visit you soon... Will: Th-thanks. Thanks, guys. *sniff* To be continued. Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement? Judge: Uh... I'm not sure I follow? Phoenix: It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought... Judge: You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence! Judge: ...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory... Phoenix: Huh? Really? Judge: Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (Whoops! That didn't go so well.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor! Judge: How exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...? Phoenix: They aren't, are they... Judge: Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor! Judge: ... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Ugh, I must be on the wrong track?) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! This court see no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for mis-interpretation of the facts. Phoenix: (W-what!? I see plenty of room! It\u2019s still wide open... no?) Judge: This court find the defendant, Mr. Will Powers... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned! Turnabout Samurai Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 Part 5 Part 6 October 18Wright & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: Whew, what a day. Maya: This is no time for relaxing, Nick! Say, you think WP's got a chance? Phoenix: I guess that really depends on the people we found out about in today's trial. Maya: The director and producer...? Phoenix: Yeah, them. Maya: Well, what are we doing here then!? Let's get to the studios! Talk What to do Phoenix: What do you think we should do? Maya: W-what do I... huh!? Why don't we do what you just said!? We gotta get the scoop on this director and producer. Phoenix: Oh, right. Then there's no point hanging out here. Maya: That's what I've been saying! Let's get to those studios pronto! Any ideas Maya: Hmm. We don't have enough information to make a case yet. Phoenix: That's exactly the same thing you said yesterday! Just admit it: you don't have a clue what happened. Maya: There's not enough information! Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Hey, see this? Maya: You... really like showing that off, don't you, Nick? Cardkey Maya: Hey, you still have that! Great! Phoenix: Well, we couldn't get into the scene of the murder without it. And its owner isn't missing it in his detention cell... Maya: Poor old WP... Powers's(?) Photo Maya: You know, what if this really was Mr. Powers? Phoenix: Yeah. It's hard to say. We don't really know anyone else it could be. I seriously doubt it was that old windbag. Maya: So Mr. Powers is... lying? Phoenix: He really doesn't seem the type, does he. (Curiouser and curiouser...) Samurai Spear Maya: I wish I had my own Samurai Spear! You'd by my own personal pincushion, Nick! Phoenix: Me!? Why me!? Anything else Maya: Sorry, I don't know how that will help us figure this out. October 18Detention CenterVisitor's Room Will: Oh, Mr. Wright! Thank you for earlier. Phoenix: Not at all. We got lucky, to tell the truth. Maya: You can say that again! Phoenix: Let's not. Maya: So, WP! Do you have any leads that might get us going in the right direction? Will: Hmm... S-sorry, but no. Maya: Be sure to tell us anything that comes to mind, no matter how small. Phoenix: We can't rely on getting lucky again tomorrow. Will: Y-yes... *sniff* Examine Security guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. Talk The fanboy Phoenix: Do, er, \"fanboys\" sneak into the studios often? Will: No, not that I know of. That security lady's pretty strict with them. Maya: But, in today's testimony, didn't she say they were often hanging around? Will: The kids really, really love the Steel Samurai. They sneak past when she's not looking, I guess. The director Phoenix: Was the director present at the morning run-through? Will: Y-yes, yes he was. He was directing how the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate should move. Maya: Why didn't you tell us that before!? Will: W-well, just, the studio asked us to keep quiet... Maya: That has nothing to do with this! I hate to repeat myself, but Nick here is a newbie lawyer! Fresh off the bar! When he loses, he's going to lose big! Will: I... I see. *sniff* Phoenix: (Whose side is she on!?) Maya: You aren't hiding anything else from us, are you!? Will: N-no, I sure hope not. Present Cardkey Phoenix: We found this cardkey in your dressing room. Will: Oh, that's mine, yes. Maya: Can people outside the studios get these cards? Will: I don't think so. Even I have to return the card. Once the show's done filming, that is. Maya: Huh... Powers's(?) Photo Phoenix: Regarding this photograph... Will: Y-yes...? Phoenix: This really, truly, absolutely isn't you, right? Will: R-right. *sniff* I was sleeping in my dressing room the whole time, honest. Phoenix: But who else could have worn it!? Maya: Your costume was in your dressing room? Will: Yes. I guess they snuck in and took it while I was asleep. Phoenix: (But who!?) Samurai Spear Phoenix: Regarding the murder weapon... Will: Yes? Phoenix: Is it heavy, that spear? Will: It's pretty hefty, yeah. I don't think the average person would be able to swing it around effectively. Phoenix: Hmm... Maya: And... that's the spear that broke or something during the morning run-through? Will: Oh yes, I goofed on a round kick, you see... I broke the spear. The security lady fixed it for me right away though. Maya: With duct tape. We heard. Anything else Will: E-excuse me. Thank you for showing me that, whatever it is. I wish I could think of some way I could help you... S-sorry. *sniff* October 18, 2:16 PMGlobal StudiosMain Gate Maya: No one's here. Phoenix: Right, now that they have Ms. Oldbag in custody. I guess they don't have anyone else to replace her... Maya: H-hey! In the guard station! Look! She left her donuts! ... ... What? I wasn't going to eat them! Examine Computer Phoenix: The computer that runs the studio security cameras. Huh? It looks like it's been turned off for the day. Guard station Phoenix: The security guard station. Ms. Oldbag must like junk food. There's a mountain of it on the desk in there. Main gate Phoenix: The main entrance to the studios. They probably have a police officer on patrol out there. October 18Studio One Entrance Maya: Hey, Nick. It looks like Detective Gumshoe isn't here today. Phoenix: You're right. He's probably up to his neck in paperwork after the commotion at today's trial. Maya: So, Nick... Remember that \"Studio Two\" we heard about at the trial today? It was down that path with the fallen tree, right? Phoenix: Yeah, I think that's what they said. Maya: Maybe the director and the rest of them are there today? Now's our chance, Nick! Let's check it out! Examine Bench Phoenix: I'm bushed. Maybe I'll sit down here for a bit. Maya: This is exactly why I don't want to get old, ever. Phoenix: H-hey! I'm still young! I'm just tired! Maya: Nick, when you start having to say \"I'm still young,\" you know it's all over. Phoenix: (But... but I AM still young!) Left path Phoenix: In the trial, they said Studio Two was down this path. The monkey head is in the way, but we should be able to get by it without a problem. Maya: This monkey head is real heavy! Phoenix: Well, it did knock that tree over when it fell. Maya: Both of these, the monkey head and the tree, fell the day of the murder, didn't they. Phoenix: Yeah, that's what Detective Gumshoe said. Statue with broken head Phoenix: The studio mascot. Apparently it's a monkey of some kind. I've never seen a monkey with a nose like that before! Maya: Why don't they put his head back on? Maybe we should ask that assistant? Phoenix: I'm not sure we really want her fixing anything. And you'd probably need a crane to move that thing. Maya: Probably so. Security camera Phoenix: That's the security camera that automatically takes pictures of people here. It took two pictures on the day of the murder, before the actual time of death. One of them was the Steel Samurai. The other was a grade school boy. It doesn't seem to be switched on today. Studio One entrance Phoenix: The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body. Welcome sign Maya: It says \"Welcome.\" Phoenix: They let people in here when they're not filming, right? Maya: Nick! Let's come here some day! Whaddya say? Phoenix: Sure, if that security lady lets us in. October 18Studio One Maya: I... don't really want to be in here. Phoenix: Yeah... It is a murder scene. Maya: I want to go someplace else. Nick? Phoenix: (*sigh*...) Examine Film camera Maya: Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton! Phoenix: Yeah! So don't touch it! Maya: Hey, smile, Nick, you're a star! Phoenix: S-stop that! Reflecting screen Phoenix: That's for reflecting light. They call it a reflecting screen or something like that. Maya: Huh. Phoenix: What? Where's your enthusiasm for all things entertainment? Maya: Well, lighting is fine, but I'd want to be the director. Or maybe the Steel Samurai! Phoenix: (I think she's being serious...!) Stage backdrop Phoenix: Looks like a backdrop for a stage. This must be used in the Steel Samurai show. Maya: Of course! That's the mountain, Neo Fujiyama! Phoenix: Doesn't the Steel Samurai take place in Olde Tokyo? Can you even see Mt. Fuji from there? Maya: Not Olde Tokyo, Nick! \"Neo\" Olde Tokyo! October 18Studio Two Entrance Maya: This... is Studio Two? Phoenix: I thought so... Maya: It doesn't really look much like a \"studio,\" does it? Phoenix: No, that it does not. Maya: Hey... There's a trailer over there. Phoenix: It looks pretty sturdy for a movie set trailer. Maya: Are we sure this is a studio? Examine Incinerator Phoenix: An incinerator. Apparently they just put this one in. It's already covered in soot. They must not clean it much. Lunch table Phoenix: Looks like two people ate here. There's nothing left on the plates. Maya: Hey, so they ate t-bone steaks too. Phoenix: What is it with steaks around here? Maya: Hey! There's always room for steak! But... something does seem out of place... Phoenix: What? Maya: I... don't know. It just feels \"odd.\" Number \"2\" sign Phoenix: There's a big \"2\" painted here. Maya: Probably because this is Studio Two? Phoenix: Probably... Though it doesn't look anything like a studio. Studio van Phoenix: A light van for moving staff and equipment around. They've kept it in pretty good shape. Looks like it'd run fine. Maya: Well, let's go for a drive! Phoenix: Sure... if I had a license. Maya: Nick! You don't have a driver's license!? Phoenix: But, look, I have this! Maya: Why are you showing me your attorney's badge, Nick? Flower garden Phoenix: There're some flowers here. Maya: Wow, so pretty! They're taking good care of these. Phoenix: Don't get to [sic] close. That fence looks dangerous. Storage materials Phoenix: These look like materials for making a movie set. Maya: They've been sitting here for quite some time. This might as well be a junkyard. Trailer Phoenix: On closer inspection, this trailer looks like it's been here for a while. I don't think this is part of some temporary film set. Trailer door Maya: Nick! Let's go inside! Phoenix: You think it's okay...? Oh well. It's locked. Maya: Aww... shucks. October 18Global StudiosEmployee Area Maya: Look, it's that assistant girl. Hey! Penny: Hi... WP's lawyers, right? I heard about the trial! Great job, guys! Phoenix: Oh? Oh hoh hoh. Don't mention it. Penny: Is it true they caught the security lady!? Phoenix: Oh! Oh... oh hoh hoh! Penny: Actually, she just called me. She told me to cover up that drain... Phoenix: You mean that one? (Wow, what a mess...) Penny: I... I know... I'm not so good with handiwork. Some assistant, right? Maya: Yeah, but you do work on the props, and the backdrops, right? Penny: R-right. Just... lots of times they end up looking worse than they did before I fixed them. Maya: Oh? Oh! Well, I'm sure these things happen. Nothing to worry yourself about! Penny: You're right! I won't! Phoenix: (Personally, I think she should worry at least a little bit more...) Penny: Um, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to the guard station. I'm supposed to fill in for Ms. Oldbag. Maya: Right! See you later, then! Penny: Good luck with your investigation. Examine Taped cardboard barrier Maya: So, the fanboy they were talking about in the trial today... He came in through that drain? Phoenix: So it seems. I guess they covered it up in a hurry. Maya: Hey... Hey, Nick! If that drain's covered, the boy won't be able to get in. Phoenix: Uh, yeah. I think that was the idea...? Maya: I feel kinda sorry for him, though. Don't you? Phoenix: What, you want to rip the grate off? Maya: Really, Nick? We can!? Phoenix: (Whoa... she's serious? Uh oh...) Rip it open Phoenix: Well, I guess some things are just made to be broken. Maya: Yay! You know, Nick, you're pretty swell sometimes. Phoenix: (Sometimes...?) Maya: Hiii-ya! There. That should make the kids happy. Phoenix: The things we do... Leads back to examination Leave it be Phoenix: Nah, I think we should leave it on. They only just repaired it. And if we take it off, that assistant will get yelled at by you-know-who. Maya: Yeah... I guess so. Phoenix: (Wow! I didn't expect her to take it that hard...) Leads back to examination Drain grate (after selecting \"Rip it open\" upon examining taped cardboard barrier) Phoenix: The drain grate is off. And I know who did it. Maya: Now the kids'll be able to come in again. Doesn't it make you feel great to do a good deed like that? Phoenix: (Must be nice to live so free of guilt.) Lunch table Phoenix: The remains of yesterday's lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak. Dressing room door Phoenix: The door to the dressing room. It's not locked. Maya: Hey, Nick! Let's go in! Maybe there'll be something else to steal? Phoenix: H-hey! We're not thieves! Maya: But we did take that cardkey... Phoenix: W-we borrowed that! There's a difference. Vending machine Phoenix: Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks or something. Popcorn, at least! Maya: W-wait! Look! \"Samurai Soda\"! Nick! Try this! Phoenix: Be my guest. Maya: Okay! Oh, too bad, it's sold out. October 18Global StudiosDressing Room Maya: This is where the Steel Samurai costume was, on the day of the murder. Phoenix: That's what Mr. Powers says, at least. I guess they snuck in and took it while he was sleeping. Maya: But Nick, what if Mr. Powers hadn't been sleeping? I wonder what the killer was planning on doing then? Phoenix: Huh... (She's got a point!) Examine Cosmetics Phoenix: There's an array of cosmetics here. According to Maya, that wig was used in some old TV show... Maya: \"Samurai Boogey-Woogey,\" Nick! Get with the picture! Phoenix: Look, explain to me how you can identify a show just by seeing a wig!? Maya: I, um, kinda like samurai movies. Phoenix: (\"Kinda\"...?) Costume rack Phoenix: There's some regular suits in among the costumes here. Those must be Mr. Powers's personal clothes. Couch Phoenix: Looks like someone was sleeping here. Maybe Powers did take a nap here, like he said. Bag Maya: Mr. Powers's bag. I wonder what's inside? Hey! Supermarket tabloids? Wow. I'm kind of shocked. Phoenix: Maya! Leave those alone! (Wolf Men Found On Mars...? I'll have to buy that issue!) Table Phoenix: There's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Some tea and cookies... Maya: Wait... Nick! Phoenix: W-what now? Maya: These snacks... they've passed the expiration date! Phoenix: ... Then don't eat them. Maya: *grumble* (They're snacks! They're meant to be eaten!) Window Phoenix: It's locked. I guess he doesn't open his window much. It is kind of dusty outside. Studio - Main Gate (after selecting \"Rip it open\" upon examining taped cardboard barrier in Global Studios - Employee Area) Penny: Oh... hello. Maya: Ho hoh! You look a little out of place. Penny: It's the clothes, isn't it? I thought my camo vest might do the trick... Kind of an \"alternative guard fashion\" thing. Examine Guard station Phoenix: The security guard station. I can see the computer that runs the security cameras. Penny: Oh, please don't touch anything in there. The security lady would knock the stuffing out of me if she knew. Talk The studios Phoenix: So, how are the studios doing? Penny: There's police wandering around everywhere, it's terrible. They won't even let me clean up. Don't want me \"disturbing evidence.\" I haven't even cleaned up our lunch plates from the day of the murder! Phoenix: You mean those plates with the steak bones left over on them in the employee area? Penny: Yeah. Can you believe it? The fanboy Maya: Do kids sneak in here a lot? Penny: Well... I don't think there's that many of them, but I do see one in particular a bunch. He's always gawking at the sets, or snapping pictures. You should see Old Windbag's eyes flash when she sees him. She has a bit of trouble catching him though... The director, et al. Phoenix: I heard something at the trial today. They said that the director and producer were here the day of the murder... Penny: Oh, sorry... I was in the prop storage room, so I didn't see them. I guess they were here, though. The studio head seemed pretty eager to keep us quiet. Maya: So they were trying to protect the director? Penny: More the producer, really. The producer's our real star here. She saved these studios from the brink of disaster and kept them running. I don't think we'd still be in business if it weren't for that producer! Phoenix: (The producer, huh?) Present Cardkey Penny: Wow, they gave a lawyer one of those cardkeys? Phoenix: Well, I'm sort of borrowing it. Penny: I see. You better be careful not to lose that. They're very strict about those cardkeys here. Phoenix: (I guess they're pretty good about keeping these out of outsider's hands.) Thanks, I'll be careful. Powers's(?) Photo Phoenix: Could you take a look at this? Penny: That's Mr. Powers. Why is he dragging his leg like that? What is this, anyway? Phoenix: (Looks like she didn't know about this photo or the injury that morning.) Uh... Never mind. Samurai Spear Phoenix: Say, you work with the props, right? About that murder weapon... Penny: You mean the Samurai Spear? Yeah, it's a prop, but it's still pretty heavy. I hate having to carry that thing around. Phoenix: (So you'd have to be pretty strong to use that as a weapon, it sounds like. Why is Mr. Powers the only person I can think of!?) Anything else Penny: Umm... Not really sure what that is. Sorry. Dressing Room (after clearing \"The director, et al.\" Talk option in Global Studios - Main Gate) ???: WTF? Who are j00 d00dz!? LMAO! Maya: H-huh!? W-we... Wait, you first! Who are you!? You look pretty suspicious to me! ???: Whatever, l4m3rs! Manella: How can j00 not know the great Sal Manella!? I make teh L33T SH0WZ! The Steel Samurai? Mine! RTFC! (Read The Film Credits!) Maya: R-really!? You're THE Sal Manella!? I'm so sorry! I, just, you looked so... Sorry! Manella: No no, quite alright. Really. It's fine. ROFL! ... Maya: W-what is it? Manella: You know, on closer inspection... Mmm... Yeah... Hot! Hot! Hot! *slobber* Hey, do j00 do a lot of \"cosplay,\" coz that costume r0x0rz!... *drool* Maya: Rocksores!? Wh-wh-what... Hey! You're drooling! Manella: Huh? Mmph! LOL! Buffer overrun! *pant* You've triggered my CR34T1V3 P0W3RZ! Yes... yes, it's coming to me! \"Pink Princess\"! The sequel to the Steel Samurai... \"Pink Princess: Warrior of Little Olde Tokyo!\" ROFL... LMAO! Phoenix: P-\"Pink Princess\"...? Maya: Why's it gotta be \"Little\" Olde Tokyo!? Why can't it have a cool name, like \"Neo Olde Tokyo\"!? Phoenix: Maya, we really need to talk about \"cool\"... Examine Table Phoenix: There's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Maya: H-hey! Nick! Phoenix: W-what now? Maya: Th-the snacks! There was twice this much here before! Manella: Ah. I, uh, I ate them. They were past their expiration date anyway. ROFL! Maya: ... Phoenix: (She's biting her lip and staring at me with tears welling in her eyes...) Talk The day of the crime Phoenix: Did you notice anything unusual on the day of the murder? Manella: Oh, I know who j00 d00dz are. That security lady told j00 about us, eh? Phoenix: That's right. Manella: It was a pretty regular day. We had a run-through for an action scene in the morning. Then a meeting from lunchtime in the Studio Two trailer. Heh. I was so busy I didn't even get a chance to eat lunch!\u00a0:( Phoenix: A t-bone steak, was it? Manella: Yeah... sux0rz! I hate missing out on food... Maya: Nick... what does \"Sucksores\" mean? Phoenix: No idea... Manella: Anyway, I was in a meeting from noon till after 4:00. With the producer, and some bigwigs from the network. Phoenix: (Mr. Hammer's time of death was estimated at 2:30 PM. If he's telling the truth, that meeting gives him an alibi...) The producer (appears after \"The day of the crime\") Phoenix: About the producer who was at the meeting with you... Manella: Oh, you mean Dee Vasquez? She's a genius. M4d sk1llz, all the way. Scary, though. *sweats* She brought these studios back from the brink of destruction. She's the one who made it possible for me to make the Steel Samurai! Phoenix: You had a meeting with her on the day of the murder, right? Manella: Yeah, we were together from noon to 4:00 PM, the whole time. The bigwigs (appears after \"The day of the crime\") Phoenix: Who exactly are these \"bigwigs\" people keep mentioning? Manella: Oh, the boss over at the network, and some sponsors. Also a few production guys. They piled into a limousine and got here right around noon. Major tension! *sweats* Phoenix: Were all of them with you the entire time? Manella: Yeah, unfortunately. They're all gray-haired geezers... *scowl* Phoenix: (Hmm... sounds like they'd all be reliable witnesses.) Present Powers's(?) Photo Manella: ... T-this is WP, right? Phoenix: How do you know? Manella: Well, look, he's obviously dragging his foot. Phoenix: (Oh, right. The director would know about the injury; he was there.) Anything else Manella: I try not to pay much attention to things that don't interest me. LOL. Maya: W-why are you staring at me like that...? October 18Studio Two Entrance Phoenix: (This place is deserted...) *crash!* Maya: Eek! N-N-Nick! W-w-what was that noise!? It sounded like it came from inside the trailer... Phoenix: Someone must be inside... Maya: H-Hello? ... Phoenix: No answer. Maya: Pretty suspicious, if you ask me, Nick! Let's go in! Phoenix: I'm not sure we should be barging in... ...Huh. It's locked. Maya: What? Don't we have a key? Phoenix: No. But there's probably one in the guard station at the main gate. Maya: Then what are we waiting for? Let's borrow it! Phoenix: (If they'll let us...) Examine Trailer door Phoenix: The trailer door. It's locked. The key is probably in the security guard station. I doubt they'd let us borrow it. Studio - Main Gate (after visiting Studio Two Entrance and visiting Global Studios - Dressing Room after clearing \"The director, et al.\" Talk option in Global Studios - Main Gate) Oldbag: Ah hah! You again! Maya: Eeeek! Oldbag: How rude, acting like you've seen a ghost! Phoenix: You... certainly got back to your post quickly. Oldbag: Oh the police took me away, they did. They pulled out a spare Steel Samurai costume! Told me to \"put it on.\" Can you imagine? How could I, a sweet little old lady, wear a giant suit like that? Phoenix: Mr. Powers is pretty tall... Oldbag: As soon as they saw there was no way I could wear it, they let me go. Phoenix: (I guess that would rule out her being the murderer.) Oldbag: Anyway! Know this, whippersnapper! This old lady NEVER forgets a slight or insult! And you won't get any information out of me! My lips are sealed! Maya: You sure are talking a lot for someone with sealed lips. Oldbag: Starting now! One, two, three, mmmph! Phoenix: (This lady's too much...) Examine Guard station Phoenix: The security guard station. I can see the computer that runs the security cameras. Oldbag: Hey! No touching! Phoenix: (Guess I'd better investigate there later...) Talk The Fanboy Phoenix: Umm, about that kid you said you saw... Oldbag: If I see him again, I'm taking him down! Maya: N-Nick! Look at her eyes! She's serious! The director, et al. Phoenix: About the dirctor, the one who was here on the day of the murder... Oldbag: If I see him again, I'm taking him down! Maya: Nick! I think she's losing it! Present Anything Phoenix: (I have a feeling she's not going to respond well to anything I show her now.) Employee Area (after visiting Studio Two Entrance and visiting Global Studios - Dressing Room after clearing \"The director, et al.\" Talk option at Global Studios - Main Gate, then revisiting Global Studios - Main Gate) Maya: Hey! H-hey! Wait! Phoenix: (I'll bet he came in right through that drain...) Maya: Hey, um, kiddy-o! What's yer name, sport? ???: I'm not a kid, so don't talk to me like that! Maya: H-huh!? But you... You are a kid! What a rude little brat. That's no way to talk to an adult! ???: I don't see no adults here! Hippie fashion chick! Maya: H-hippie fashion...? Nick... I think I'm being mocked. Phoenix: (You got to hand it to Maya, she's pretty sharp. And pretty mad...) Cody: I'm Cody! Cody Hackins. Call me \"kiddy-o\" again and I'll cut you down where you stand, evildoer! Examine Drain grate Phoenix: The drain where the fanboy came in. He didn't waste any time coming in, either. Talk about cause and effect. Talk The Steel Samurai Phoenix: So, you're a fan of the Steel Samurai? Cody: How dare you utter that name, evildoer! Maya: What do you mean? We're on the Steel Samurai's side! Cody: H-hah! Hah hah! You can't fool me! Maya: Okay... then what's the last line said by the innkeeper in Episode 8? Cody: Hah! Easy! \"Like some fries with that?\" Maya: Hmph... not bad, kiddy-o. Cody: Watch it! Phoenix: (What are they doing!?) What happened Leads to: \"Say, you heard anything about the incident the other day?\" Present Anything Cody: Evildoers! Phoenix: Say, you heard anything about the incident the other day? Cody: ... Maya: You were here, weren't you? Cody: ... Phoenix: Did you see anything...? Cody: He... he... Phoenix: ? Cody: He... always... The Steel Samurai always wins! Always! Yeah, I saw 'em! I saw everything! Maya: What!? Cody: But... but no way am I telling you losers! Maya: Wha--!? Wait... Cody: Lemme go! Maya: ... He's gone. Huh? Something fell off the table when he bumped into it on his way out. Phoenix: A... bottle? Why was this sitting there, I wonder? Empty Bottle slipped into pocket. Phoenix: Anyway, what was that kid saying? Maya: He \"saw everything\"... Studio - Main Gate Maya: Huh? Where's that old windbag? Phoenix: Odd of her to leave her post... Oldbag: (H-hey!!!) Maya: Nick! That was her! Oldbag: (S-stop! Whippersnapper!) Phoenix: Y-yeah. Sounds like she's chasing after that boy. Oldbag: Natch! Maya: Uh oh, she tripped! Phoenix: (Maya sure looks happy...) Examine Guard station Maya: Hey, hey, Nick. Now's our chance! Let's check out the guard station! Phoenix: Good idea. Maya: ... Oh! This is it, Nick! The \"Trailer Key\"! Phoenix: The key to that trailer in Studio Two! Maya: We'll be borrowing this, right, Nick? Trailer Key slipped into pocket. (Changed from [Trailer Key slipped into your pocket.] in the original release) Guard station (subsequent times) Phoenix: The security guard station. Ms. Oldbag must like junk food. There's a mountain of it on the desk in there. Outside Studio Two (after examining guard station in Global Studios - Main Gate) Examine Trailer door Phoenix: I wonder if the key we borrowed from the guard station will work? ... It opened. Maya: Great! Let's go, Nick! Phoenix: (She seems eager all of a sudden...) Maya: Well, you first, Nick! Phoenix: (Ah, not THAT eager.) Trailer door (subsequent times) Phoenix: The trailer door. It's unlocked. After examining trailer door in Studio Two Entrance: October 18Studio Two Trailer ???: ... Maya: Eek! S-someone's in here! ???: Names. Maya: O-our n-names? Um, w-we're WP's lawyers, and, um... ???: I see. ... Maya: A-and who might you...? Vasquez: Dee Vasquez. The producer. Phoenix: (Dee Vasquez... She's quite beautiful.) Examine Left poster Phoenix: Another old movie poster. \"'The Singing Samurai' starring Jack Hammer.\" What the hell do samurai sing about? Chopping off heads? Maya: Oh. My. God. That movie was the best! It's about a samurai who sings his way to fame and fortune! Mr. Hammer was a very accomplished singer, you know. Phoenix: Singing samurai stars... What's next? Ninja ballet? Middle poster Phoenix: \"'Samurai Summer' starring Jack Hammer.\" This poster's quite old. Maya: Wow! It's been years since I saw that show! It was one of those typical summer romance stories... but it was great! Phoenix: A typical summer romance... with a samurai on a horse? Right poster Phoenix: An old movie poster. \"'Dynamite Samurai' starring Jack Hammer.\" I guess Mr. Hammer used to be quite the star. Table Phoenix: This is where they had that meeting. There are documents and paper cups scattered around. Trash can Phoenix: Nothing in here that could be a clue. Just some paper cups and crumpled documents. Whiteboard Phoenix: It looks like they were designing a set to use for the Steel Samurai show. They've got some figures for how much the set costs... I can't believe they spend that much money on those sets! Window Phoenix: The glass is frosted. I can't see outside. This far into October, the dimming daylight makes it feel like winter's coming. Talk The day of the crime Phoenix: I was wondering if you could tell me about the day of the murder... Vasquez: ... ... Phoenix: M-Ms. Vasquez? Vasquez: Script. Phoenix: E-excuse me? Vasquez: Script. I'm looking for a script. Phoenix: A s-script? Vasquez: \"The Steel Samurai, Episode 13.\" I need it. Maya: Umm... could we ask you a bit about the day of the murder? Vasquez: I need to read it. ... Maya: ... Phoenix: ... (We're getting nowhere fast.) The Steel Samurai Maya: Um, w-we'd really like to ask you about the Steel Samurai! Vasquez: ... ... Phoenix: Ms. Vasquez? Vasquez: It's on TV. Every week. That's all I have to say about that. Maya: N-Nick! She's telling us to go watch TV!? The nerve of her! Phoenix: Hey, don't get mad at me. The director Phoenix: About the director... Sal Manella, was it? What, er, exactly is his role here...? Vasquez: Perhaps I didn't make myself clear? I'm looking for a script. I can't be bothered with anything else. ... Maya: Nick? Are all people in the entertainment business this... weird? Phoenix: It's starting to look like it. Present Anything Vasquez: I'm not interested. After clearing all Talk options: Maya: Nick, let's get out of here. Isn't there someplace else we have to check? Phoenix: Y-yeah. Vasquez: Wait. Phoenix: Y-yes? Vasquez: If you see Manella, give him this. Maya: W-why do we have to do your errands...! Vasquez: ... Maya: ... Vasquez: ... Maya: I... I don't think I like her. *sniff* Phoenix: Don't cry. She'll take it as a sign of weakness. Alright. We'll give it to him if we see him. Vasquez's Memo added to the Court Record. Dressing Room Present Vasquez's Memo Phoenix: Here. I got this from the producer... Manella: Huh? \"Bring the script for Episode 13\"? Episode 13... where did I put that one? ... I must have left it somewhere... *sweats* U-uh oh... My ass is p0wned if I don't find it... *shakes* Maya: Nick... It might be quicker to just look in all the places where he's likely to have been. Phoenix: I agree. Inside Studio One (after presenting Vasquez's Memo in Global Studios - Dressing Room) Maya: We're back at the scene of the crime. Let's find what we need and get out of here quick, Nick. Examine Director's chair Maya: Hey! Look! That's the chair the director sits in! I've always wanted to sit in one of these. Phoenix: (The director...!) Maya... Take a look around that chair for me, would you? Remember that script the director was talking about? Didn't he say he'd left it somewhere? Maya: Ahah! Found it, Nick! The script! Phoenix: Good work! Script placed in pocket. Director's chair (subsequent times) Maya: Hey! Look! That's the chair the director sits in! I've always wanted to sit in one of these. Hey Nick, take a look at that. One of those black-and-white boards they clap at the start of filming! And look! A megaphone! A real live megaphone! Phoenix: ... Maya: Ready, Nick? Action! Phoenix: (This girl is more troubled than I thought.) Dressing Room Present Script Phoenix: We found your script. Manella: W00t! THX! S-still... I dunno... That woman is to be ph34red when you bring something to her late... Say, um, j00 think j00 d00dz could take it down there for me? THX! Maya: Is that producer really that scary? Phoenix: (Well, she's certainly not NORMAL...) Trailer Talk The blocked path (appears after presenting Script) Leads to: \"On the day of the murder, the path that leads here was blocked?\" Present Script Phoenix: Here, we found it! Your script! Vasquez: Ah. Script handed to Dee Vasquez. Vasquez: ... Phoenix: ... Umm... uh... You're not going to talk to us? Vasquez: Quiet. I'm reading. Maya: ...! Just you hold on! What's the big idea!? Who do you think you are anyway!? And, and do you even know who we are!? Vasquez: ... Powers's lawyers? Maya: Umm.... right. Vasquez: Am I a suspect? Maya: N-no, it's just, well, no, but... Vasquez: ... You wanted to know about the day of the murder? Maya: Y-yes. Anything you could tell us would be a big help. Vasquez: ... You know there was a meeting here at noon? Phoenix: Yes. With the director and the people from the network... Vasquez: Correct. Now, listen closely. None of the people in this trailer that afternoon went to Studio One. It was impossible for us to leave. Maya: Impossible? Why? Vasquez: The path was blocked. Phoenix: The... path? Phoenix: On the day of the murder, the path that leads here was blocked? Vasquez: You saw Mr. Monkey on the way here, correct? Phoenix: M-\"Mr. Monkey\"? Vasquez: The monkey with the broken head. Phoenix: Oh, right, that... (What an original name...) Vasquez: Its head fell over in the wind on the day of the murder. They didn't start moving the head out of the way until after 3:00. It was after 4:00 by the time the path was unblocked. Capice? Everyone in this trailer was stuck here until the path was cleared. Stuck in this trailer. Stuck until after 4:00. Hammer died at 2:30. Thus, none of us could have gone to Studio One. Maya: W-what!? Vasquez: It's true. A crane came just after 3:00 to move the head. We called some people in to clear the way. I'm sure they'd corroborate my story. Phoenix: B-but wait! What if the head fell over after 2:30? Then you could have gone to Studio One! Vasquez: 2:30... the time of death. ... Very well. Come. Outside Studio One Vasquez: ... That's \"Mr. Monkey.\" When it wasn't broken, it announced the time... in \"ooks.\" One \"ook\" per hour. Ook ook ook ook. Always with the ooking. Phoenix: (It IS a monkey, after all.) Vasquez: Check its head. The clock inside stopped when it broke. Maya: ...! Nick, it's stopped at 2:15. Phoenix: 2:15...? Vasquez: That's right. This path was blocked from 2:15 till after 4:00. Therefore, we're innocent. Phoenix: Mr. Hammer died in Studio One at 2:30... Vasquez: See? Good bye. Mr. Monkey's Head data added to the Court Record. (Changed from [Mr. Monkey data added to the Court Record.] in the original release) Maya: What do we do, Nick? There isn't anyone besides WP who could have killed Hammer! It's over... We're finished! Phoenix: (It sure doesn't look good. Guess we should head back to the office and plan our strategy...) Examine Bench Phoenix: I really want to take a break, but we have work to do! Still, it's kind of sad to see so many empty benches... Kind of like if you threw a party, and nobody came. Left path Phoenix: This is the path that goes to Studio Two. The mascot's head fell right on the path on the day of the murder. The path was completely blocked between 2:00 and 4:00. Mr. Monkey Phoenix: I see. There's a clock and a speaker in the monkey's head. It would usually tell the time by \"ook\"ing. The clock is stopped at 2:15 now. October 18Wright & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: Now what... We're fresh out of clues. Everyone's alibi is water-tight. We don't even have any promising leads. Things are looking pretty grim. ???: It's a little early for giving up, don't you think? Phoenix: Huh? ???: You've got one lead... Phoenix: M-Mia! It's you! What took you so long!? Mia: Sorry, Phoenix. Maya has trouble calling me unless she's really in trouble. Phoenix: Right! Oh, wait. I guess that means we're really in trouble. Mia: I'd say so. Phoenix: What did you mean, we have one lead...? Mia: The boy, of course. Cody: Yeah, I saw 'em. I saw everything! Maya: What!? Cody: But...but no way am I telling you losers! Phoenix: I dunno. He didn't sound like he was going to help us at all. Mia: I'm sure you can find some way of bringing him over to your side. Either way, we should get back to the studios. That boy is our last hope, Phoenix. Phoenix: (Thanks, now I'm more worried than I was before...) Examine Houseplant Mia: My poor plant! It looks so... so sluggish! Have you been watering it properly, Phoenix? Phoenix: Um, well, Maya has actually... I think maybe she's giving it too much. Mia: That child! Sorry, Charley. Phoenix: (The plant's name is... Charley?) Movie poster Phoenix: A poster of an old movie that Mia liked. Oh, hey! Mia, what's the name of this movie? Mia: That movie...? Oh! I'd sure like to see that one again! It's, um... What was it, again? S-sorry, it's right on the tip of my tongue... Phoenix: (Let me guess... it's a suspense thriller?) Talk What to do Phoenix: So, what's the best thing to do from here? Mia: We need to get to the studio and talk to that boy. Any ideas Phoenix: So, do you have any ideas about who might have done this? Mia: We don't have enough information to make a case yet. Phoenix: (Where have I heard that phrase before? So THAT's where Maya got it from...) Present Anything Mia: Showing me that isn't going to do any good. You know what they say, \"Dead men don't tell tales.\" Phoenix: (You sure are talking enough!) October 18Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: I guess Mr. Powers is in questioning... Mia: Oh well. Let's try again another day, Phoenix. October 18Global StudiosMain Gate Oldbag: Huff... puff... huff... puff... huff... puff... huff... Huff... puff... huff... puff... huff... puff... huff... Phoenix: W-what's wrong? Oldbag: Huff... puff... huff... puff... whih... whippersnapper! Phoenix: (She's been chasing that boy this whole time.) Oldbag: Huff... puff... when... when I ca... catch him... I... huff Phoenix: (Sounds like she hasn't had any luck catching him.) Oldbag: Huff... puff... I...  I got a hostage now, whippersnapper! Phoenix: (A \"hostage\"...!?) Talk The fanboy Phoenix: Umm... what happened to the boy? Oldbag: I-if I see him a-again, I'll... huff! L-lay him flat! Huff... puff... Mia: My, what a violent old lady... The director, et al. Phoenix: Actually, I met with the director just now... Oldbag: Eh? Hah... my heart, it don't feel so good. Phoenix: (Is she okay!?) Oldbag: B-before I go, I'd like to v-visit the place where poor H-Hammer died... Phoenix: (Right... she was saying she wanted to visit the studio where he died.) The \"hostage\" Phoenix: What's this about a \"hostage\"? Oldbag: Huff... huff... W-when that boy was running away... ...he dropped this, a-and ran! Huff... huff... H-he'll come back... huff... huff... for this one! Phoenix: (It's kind of hard to understand her with all that huffing and puffing.) Mia: Phoenix! That \"hostage\" might be what we need! Cody might talk to us if we gave him that! Phoenix: (Good idea!) Ms. Oldbag! Might I... Oldbag: No! I'm catching that brat if it's the last thing I do! Mia: Phoenix. Do you have anything you might trade with her? Phoenix: (A trade, hmm... I wonder...?) Present Cardkey Oldbag: H-hey... that... huff... That's a card... huff... Studio One? Phoenix: Right. A cardkey to Studio One. Oldbag: Huff... puff... I... I could visit poor Hammer... I'd like to visit... huff... he died... whew. I was his... his fan. Phoenix: You don't have your own card, Ms. Oldbag? Oldbag: Studio One isn't my turf. Huff... huff... You'll let me borrow... borrow it, then? Phoenix: (If I give her the cardkey, then I won't be able to get into Studio One...!) Keep the cardkey Phoenix: Sorry, we have our own investigating to do there. Oldbag: Huff... huff... puff. Poo. Phoenix: (Was that last bit a breath, or a pout...?) Leads back to Court Record Lend her the cardkey Leads to: \"Why don't you let her borrow it, Phoenix?\" Powers's(?) Photo Oldbag: I... I told you who I s-saw! Huff! Huff... it... it was Powers! Phoenix: (Well, at least she's consistent...) Trailer Key Phoenix: Ms. Oldbag? I'm borrowing this... just so you know. Oldbag: Oh... o-okay... huff. J-just be sure to... huff... give it b-back... puff. Phoenix: (She's not as demanding when she's exhausted.) Anything else Oldbag: Huff... huff... puff... ... huff... puff... haaah! ... Huff.. huff... puff... huff... puff... huff... hooo! Phoenix: (She's too busy catching her breath to tell me anything!) Mia: Why don't you let her borrow it, Phoenix? Phoenix: I guess it can't hurt. Here you go, Ms. Oldbag. Cardkey lent to Ms. Oldbag. Oldbag: ... Listen to me, sonny. I don't like having debts to no whippersnappers. You take this, and we're even. Deal? Phoenix: What's this...? A Steel Samurai trading card? Oldbag: That sneaky kid dropped it! I figure it's pretty important to him, though. Phoenix: Thank you, I may have a use for this. (This must be the \"hostage\" she was talking about.) Steel Samurai Card added to the Court Record. Oldbag: Right. I'm off. Phoenix: (There she goes, hobbling off toward the studio...) Outside Studio One Examine Welcome sign Phoenix: \"Welcome\"... I wonder if the murder will make this place famous, too. Inside Studio One Examine Director's chair Phoenix: A classic director's chair. I'm surprised they don't have an extra large one for Mr. Manella. Film camera Phoenix: A collection of expensive film equipment. I can't even begin to imagine how much just one of these costs. If we broke one, we'd go bankrupt for sure. Reflecting screen Phoenix: A panel for reflecting light. They call it a \"reflecting board\" or something. Stage backdrop Phoenix: A stage backdrop. This is \"Neo Fujiyama,\" according to Maya. It looks incredibly fake, but I guess the kids don't mind. (Step)ladder Phoenix: A perfectly normal stepladder. I've never actually used one. I don't like heights. I'm a firm belever that humankind was made to keep both feet on the ground. Outside Studio Two Examine Lunch table Phoenix: Looks like two people ate here. There's nothing left on the plates. Number \"2\" sign Phoenix: There's a big \"2\" painted here. Probably because this is Studio Two? Probably... Though it doesn't look anything like a studio. Studio van Phoenix: A light van for moving staff and equipment around. They've kept it in pretty good shape. Looks like it'd run fine. Flower garden Phoenix: Nameless flowers bloom in solitude. They probably have a proper name... But it is not for me to know. Not now, nor ever till the end of my days. ... I need a vacation. Storage materials Phoenix: These look like materials for making a movie set. They've been sitting here for quite some time. This might as well be a junkyard. Trailer door Phoenix: The door is unlocked. We could probably just walk right in. Trailer Examine Left poster Phoenix: Another old movie poster. \"'The Singing Samurai' starring Jack Hammer.\" What the hell do samurai sing about? Chopping off heads? Mia: It's a samurai musical set in ancient Japan. Phoenix: A s-samurai musical? Is that even a genre!? Well, I'm impressed. You know your stuff, Mia. Mia: Oh, Maya's the real fan. I just picked a little up. Middle poster Phoenix: \"'Samurai Summer' starring Jack Hammer.\" This poster looks like it's been hanging here for years. Mia: This is one of Maya's favorite movies. Phoenix: Maybe we should replace the poster in the office with this one? Mia: That... would be kind of sad. October 18Global StudiosEmployee Area Phoenix: Hey! Hey, you! W-wait a sec! Mia: ... Phoenix... Was that the boy? Phoenix: Yeah. His name's \"Cody Hackins.\" Mia: I think he ran into the dressing room. Examine Bicycle Phoenix: Looks like one of those electric-powered bicycles. I dunno about these. I mean, what's the point? Mia: It makes it a lot easier to go up hills! Phoenix: Where have I heard that line before...? Dressing room door Phoenix: The door to the dressing room. It's not locked. Mia: This is where Cody ran... Let's go in and see if we can get him to talk. Storage room door Phoenix: That must be the storage room. That's where they keep all the film equipment. Vending machine Phoenix: Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks, or something. Popcorn, at least! Mia: Look at this! \"Spaghetti in a Soda Can\"...? Phoenix: S-spaghetti? Wouldn't just the sauce come out and the noodles all stay stuck inside? Mia: \"Best when slammed.\" I guess they want you to drink it in one gulp...? Phoenix: Slamming spaghetti. Right... October 18Global StudiosDressing Room Phoenix: He's sure to be in here somewhere... Found you! Cody: ...! Phoenix: Dammit! He's getting away! Mia: Come back! ... There. He's back. Phoenix: (How did she...!?) Cody: ... Mia: Hey there. Would you mind helping us out? Please? Cody: ... I-I'm Cody. Mia: Hello, Cody. I'm Mia. Mia Fey. Nice to meet you. Cody: Yo. Phoenix: And I'm Phoenix Wright! Cody: Who asked? Mia: Phoenix, you can take it from here. Phoenix: (I'm not so sure I'm qualified...) Examine Cosmetics Phoenix: There's an array of cosmetics here. According to Maya, that wig was used in some old TV show... Cody: You don't know \"Samurai Boogey-Woogey\"!? You're even lamer than I thought! Phoenix: (Why does everybody but me know about this show!?) Powers's bag Phoenix: Mr. Powers's bag. Mia: Now, Phoenix, it's not polite to look through other people's belongings. Phoenix: H-hey, don't look at me! (Tell that to your sister!) Table Phoenix: There's a box of snacks on the table, and some cans of soda. They're all empty. I'm glad Maya isn't here to see this. She'd be devastated. Mia: Sorry? What was that about Maya? Phoenix: O-oh, nothing. Talk The Steel Samurai Phoenix: The Steel Samurai's so cool. I think he's the, um, the \"bomb.\" Cody: Hah! What would a lamer like you know about the Steel Samurai! Phoenix: H-hey, watch that attitude! Mia: Phoenix, you really should't yell like that. He's only a kid. Cody: Yeah! Don't yell like that I'm only a kid! What happened Phoenix: So, do you know anything about what happened here? Could you tell me, please? Cody: I don't know nothing! Phoenix: (Hmm... looks like a little persuasion's necessary. Maybe a bribe...?) Present Powers's(?) Photo Cody: Hey, it's the Steel Samurai. Huh? Why's he dragging his foot like that? Where'd you get this, anyway? Samurai Spear Cody: The Samurai Spear! That's totally cool. I wish I had one, too... Phoenix: (This kid and Maya would get along great.) Steel Samurai Card Phoenix: Cody... This look familiar? Cody: Hey! My UR! Phoenix: \"You are\"... huh? Cody: \"U.R.\" You know, \"ultra rare\"! That card's really hard to get! Man, for a grown-up, you sure are dumb! Phoenix: I'll give you this... IF you help me. Cody: But that's my card! By offering me something I already own, you're in effect eschewing the very basis of our consumer society, namely the principle of fair trade! Man, for a grown-up, you sure are dumb! Phoenix: (W-what do they teach these kids in school these days!? Quantum physics!?) Cody: Whatever, I don't need that card. Phoenix: Huh? Cody: I got a double. Just keep it. It's yours. Phoenix: (What!? After I went through all that trouble...) Cody: If you want to trade, find me a REALLY rare card! Phoenix: \"Really rare\"!? You mean there's something rarer than \"Ultra Rare\"!? Cody: Ultra Rare Premium cards are way rarer than plain Ultra Rare cards! Come ON! Man, for a grown-up, you sure are dumb! Phoenix: Premium... rare... why do I feel like we're talking about steaks? Anything else Cody: What's that? Bo-ring! Man, how can one person be so lame!? If you were a superhero you'd be Lame-o-man! After clearing \"The blocked path\" Talk option in Studio Two Trailer, then revisiting Wright & Co. Law Offices, then presenting Steel Samurai Card in Global Studios - Dressing Room: October 18Studio Two Trailer Penny: Oh, hi. Phoenix: Hello. What brings you here? Penny: Oh, well, I had to arrange some stuff... Umm... Phoenix: Yes? Penny: The, um, girl with you. Doesn't she seem a little different? Like, is she even the same person as before? Phoenix: Um, nope! She's the same as always. Mia: Same as always. Penny: Okay... whatever you say... Talk The fanboy Phoenix: Have you seen that boy since then? Penny: Nope. You missed it, though. The security lady was chasing around after the boy so fast I thought she'd collapse. Of course, he got away in the end. Boy, was she mad! Phoenix: Actually, we saw them. How's the old windbag doing? Penny: She was squeezing donuts through her clenched fists back at the guard station. Phoenix: (Some people take their jobs a little too seriously.) Mr. Hammer Phoenix: Are all the posters on the wall here of Hammer? Penny: Yes. It's really a terrible loss for the studios. Phoenix: But... his popularity had been waning recently, right? Penny: That's true. Then again, after what happened... Phoenix: After WHAT happened? Penny: Y-you mean, you don't know about Hammer...? Phoenix: No, what? Penny: I-I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said anything. What happened (appears after \"Mr. Hammer\") Phoenix: Wait, now you have to tell me. What happened with Hammer? Penny: I-I'm sorry. I'm probably not the one who should tell you. Phoenix: (Uh oh. Why do I get the feeling something's being covered up here?) Present Steel Samurai Card Leads to: \"Do you know anything about this?\" Anything else Penny: Umm... Sorry. I'm really Not sure what that is. Phoenix: Do you know anything about this? Penny: Hey, that's a Steel Samurai trading card. I collect those, actually. I'm one card away from a complete set! Phoenix: A complete set? Penny: Yeah, a set of one of each card. Phoenix: Huh... Penny: ... Wait...Waitwaitwaitwait!!! That's it!!! That's the card I need! You don't know how long I've been looking for it! Phoenix: Uh... Penny: I don't care what kind of girl you might think I am, I need that card! P-please! I beg you! Please trade with me! Phoenix: T-trade with you? Penny: Yes, trade cards! Look, I'll even trade you an Ultra Rare Premium card! Phoenix: Trade me a... huh? Penny: Yes, it's a good deal for your Ultra Rare! Please!!! Mia: Phoenix! Can't you see she's desperate? Phoenix: (W-what's everybody getting so excited about...?) Trade Phoenix: Okay. Leads to: \"Really!? Th-thanks!!!\" Don't trade Phoenix: No... no, I can't. See, this card isn't really even mine. Penny: !!! I... I see. O-of course. Of course it wouldn't be yours. Of course you couldn't trade it with me. Of course I won't ever get that card, ever. Of course I don't even really deserve that card. Mia: Phoenix, do something! She's blacking out! Phoenix: O-o-okay, okay! I'll trade! Leads to: \"Really!? Th-thanks!!!\" Penny: Really!? Th-thanks!!! Then this is for you. URP Card added to the Court Record. Penny: Yaa-hoo! Phoenix: (And there she goes...) Mia: Doesn't doing good things like that make you feel great? Phoenix: Yeah. Yeah, it does. Dressing Room Present URP Card Leads to: \"See this card?\" Phoenix: See this card? Cody: Yeah, so... Wait! That's it!!! That's the last Ultra Rare Premium card I need! C'mon give it to me, please! You gotta give it to me! Phoenix: (Wow, I've never seen him so... eager.) R-right! Okay! How about a trade? Cody: You're on! I'll give you a \"Samurai Spear\" and throw in an \"Evil Magistrate\" to boot!! Phoenix: No no no no... not that kind of trade. I don't want cards. I want information. Cody: Huh? You sure? Fine by me! URP Card given to Cody. (Changed from [Gave URP Card to Cody.] in the original release) Mia: Okay, Phoenix. Let's hear what he has to say. If he knows something that could help us, we can have him take the stand tomorrow. Talk The Steel Samurai Phoenix: So... you like the Steel Samurai. Cody: He's so cool! Phoenix: I... I guess. Cody: You're judging him by his looks! You have to look at his actions, at his life! Phoenix: (I'm being lectured on life by a grade schooler...) Cody: You like him too, don'tcha? Phoenix: Uh... Oh, me? Y-yeah! I, um, love the Steel Samurai. Cody: So, tell me what your favorite thing about the Steel Samurai is! His kind nature Phoenix: R-right... (C'mon, think of something!) I really like his, um, his kind nature. What a guy! Cody: Totally! He looks so tough, but inside, he's as gentle as a kitten! Phoenix: Yeah... Cody: So, what else do you like about him? Phoenix: (Don't tell me I have to keep this act up...) Leads back to: \"So, tell me what your favorite thing about the Steel Samurai is!\" His fighting skills Leads to: \"Got to think of something...\" Will Powers's acting Phoenix: W-well... (I've never even seen a full episode of that dumb show.) A-actually, I'm kind of a fan of Will Powers... Cody: Whoa! That's totally hard-core! Phoenix: (You're calling ME hard-core?) Cody: So, what else do you like about him? Phoenix: (Don't tell me I have to keep this act up...) Leads back to: \"So, tell me what your favorite thing about the Steel Samurai is!\" Phoenix: (Got to think of something...) I like it when he, uh, he vanquishes his foes! Cody: Yeah! Whizzam! The Steel Samurai always wins! Always! Check this out! It's my fan album! Phoenix: What the...? It's all pictures of the Steel Samurai. Cody: I go to every live performance! Phoenix: (Those stupid publicity stunts where they beat each other up in public...?) Cody: I always take a picture when the Steel Samurai lands the final blow! Whizzam! I got 'em all! I never missed one! A perfect collection! Check it out! My new digital camera! Mia: Wow, that's very impressive. The newest model, isn't it? Cody: You bet, lady! I just got it for my birthday. My album has a name, wanna hear it? \"The Steel Samurai: Path To Glory.\" The Steel Samurai always wins! Always! Hey, if you want this, you can have it, lady. Mia: Really? Are you sure? Cody: Yeah, I took these with a digital camera. I got all the data at home so I can always make another one. Mia: Well, then I'm happy to accept! Thank you. \"Path to Glory\" received. Phoenix: (What's with people always giving stuff to Mia? What a life!) Mia: ? The Steel Samurai (subsequent times) Phoenix: So... you like the Steel Samurai. Cody: Well, yeah! Duh! He's so strong! Phoenix: I... I guess. Cody: You're judging him by his looks! You have to look at his actions, at his life! Phoenix: (I'm being lectured on life by a grade schooler...) What happened Phoenix: You were here on the day of the... incident, right? Cody: Yeah... Phoenix: Did you see anything unusual? Cody: ... Mia: Cody. Cody: ! Mia: Cody, he needs to know because he's fighting for justice. Isn't that the Steel Samurai's motto? \"For great justice\"? You have to help us fight for great justice, too. Cody: I... I saw... I saw everything! Phoenix: (Well, well... We might get some useful information out of him yet.) What you saw (appears after \"The Steel Samurai\" and \"What happened\") Leads to: \"Cody... I need to ask you something very important.\" Present \"Path to Glory\" Phoenix: Thanks for this. Cody: Hey, I gave that to the nice lady, not you, loser! No looking at that, okay! Phoenix: (Believe me, I wasn't going to...) Phoenix: Cody... I need to ask you something very important. What did you see on the day of the incident? Cody: ... I got here that day around 2:00... I had to come in through the woods out back so that old lady wouldn't see me. I got kinda lost, though. I was in there for maybe a half hour or so. Then I finally got to the studio. After that... Mia: What is it, Cody? Cody: Th-the Steel Samurai killed the bad guy! He used his Samurai Spear! Just like always! One shot, one kill! It happened so fast... I got scared. I went home after that. Phoenix: I... I see. It must have been hard for you. Cody: Man, you say those nice things but it's so obvious you aren't speaking from the heart. Phoenix: (Umm... right.) Mia? Mia: Yes? Phoenix: I think we can say for sure this means the Steel Samurai did it. Mia: True enough. Phoenix: And the director has an alibi, so it wasn't him. Mia: Indeed. Phoenix: So... the only person left who it could have been is Will Powers! Mia: ... I have to admit, it's kind of a shock. But if you put this boy on the witness stand, your client will be \"guilty\" for sure. Phoenix: Let's not call him then... Mia: I think that would be wise. Best to leave this one alone. ???: Not so fast, pal! Gumshoe: I heard everything! This boy here's a key witness! And he's under police protection, starting now! C'mon, son. You've got a rendezvous with me down at the precinct! Cody: No! I ain't going! Waah! Mia: ... That didn't go so well. We're back to zero leads. And now we have a serious handicap in court. Phoenix: W-what're we going to do, Mia! Mia: Well, hmm... I... really need to be going. Don't worry, Phoenix. I'm sure you'll be fine! Phoenix: Whoa whoa whoa! C-come to the trial tomorrow, please! I need you there! Mia: Phoenix, can I ask you something? Do you really believe that Mr. Powers is innocent? I believe Phoenix: Of course he is! Mia: ... That's all I wanted to hear. Excellent. I'll see you in court, then. Leads to: \"Great! Thanks, Mia!\" I don't know Phoenix: (I never expected things to go this badly for Powers's case... I'm not sure we can win this one.) Mia: Phoenix? If you don't believe him, who will!? Phoenix: (Uh oh, she's mad.) Mia: Oh well... I'll see you in court tomorrow then. Leads to: \"Great! Thanks, Mia!\" Phoenix: Great! Thanks, Mia! Mia: See you soon. To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here. Turnabout Samurai Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 Part 5 Part 6 October 19, 9:42 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1 Will: ... ... Umm... Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yes? Will: Why do you look so... unhappy? Phoenix: O-oh! Oh, nothing! Eh heh heh. Really, it's nothing. Right, Mia? (Uh oh. She looks even unhappier...) Mia: Phoenix. Your client is now practically a dead man walking... Perhaps that's why I feel particularly close to him. Phoenix: This is no time for dead-people jokes, please. Mia: You know we're going into this trial utterly defenseless. Yet, if Mr. Powers is truly innocent... We should be able to find something overlooked in the evidence to prove it. Phoenix: Something \"overlooked\"...? Mia: We have to find something, Phoenix, today. It's that, or lose the trial. Phoenix: (This isn't going to be easy.) October 19, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4 Judge: The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers. Edgeworth: The prosecution is ready, Your Honor. Phoenix: The defense is ready, Your Honor. Judge: Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please. Edgeworth: An unexpected fact has come to the attention of the court. Yesterday, we learned that there were other people present at the studios. Today, I would like to show evidence proving they had nothing to do with the murder. Judge: Very well. You may call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth. Phoenix: (I wonder if it'll be that producer...) (Changed from [I wonder if that producer is going to come out...] in the original release) Edgeworth: The prosecution calls Mr. Sal Manella to the stand. Phoenix: (...or that director.) Edgeworth: Will the witness state his name and profession? Manella: ... How r00d can j00 get! J00 don't know ME!? I'm the director! I make the Steel Samurai, n00b! ROFL! Edgeworth: ... Manella: S... Sal Manella. I'm a director. Television. Judge: Were you at Global Studios on the day of the murder? Manella: Y-yes, Your Honor. Judge: Hmm... Very well. Please testify to the court about the events of that day. Mia: Phoenix. Let's start by picking this testimony apart. If Powers is innocent, you know what that means. Someone in the trailer on that day did it! Phoenix: R-right. (She doesn't waste any time putting on the pressure!) Witness Testimony -- The Day of the Murder -- Manella: I was at the studios from around 9:00 that morning. During the morning, I was doing... umm... an action scene run-through. It took a lot more time than I thought it would. I hear that everyone else ate lunch in the Employee Area... But I had a meeting in the Studio Two trailer, so I ended up skipping lunch. We were in the meeting until around 4:00... During the meeting, well, I'm pretty sure no one left their chairs. That's about it. Judge: Hmm... The time of Mr. Hammer's death was 2:30 PM. And according to your testimony, you were in a meeting at that time. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination. Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. Cross Examination -- The Day of the Murder -- Manella: I was at the studios from around 9:00 that morning. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Is that when you always come in to work? Manella: Oh, oh no. I come in all sort of hours. It's the \"industry\" way. Phoenix: (Yeah, I know all about the freaks in your \"industry\"...) Manella: Still, FWIW, I was pretty busy all that day.\u00a0:( Edgeworth: Tell us more about that. Manella: During the morning, I was doing... umm... an action scene run-through. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: In the Employee Area? Manella: That's right. It was a fight scene between the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate. Phoenix: Was anyone else at the run-through? Manella: Oh, yeah. That security lady was sitting there watching the whole thing. LOL. She was cheering on Hammer, if you can believe it. Phoenix: (She certainly has the lungs for it...) Anyone else? Manella: Nope, just us four. Manella: It took a lot more time than I thought it would. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why did it go on so long? Manella: Um, I'm pretty sure j00've already heard about this... But WP twisted his ankle during the run-through, see... Phoenix: (Oh, right, thus the limp.) Manella: Which of course led to me missing my lunch. ROFS! Phoenix: (ROFS? Rolling on the Floor... Starving?) Manella: I hear that everyone else ate lunch in the Employee Area... Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What exactly did they have for lunch? Manella: T-bone steak! The assistant cooked some up. Phoenix: (Come to think of it, there was a plate with some bones on it in the Employee Area.) Edgeworth: \"Everyone else\" meaning that the witness did not eat with them. Manella: But I had a meeting in the Studio Two trailer, so I ended up skipping lunch. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, in the end, you didn't get to eat? Manella: Yeah. No steak, at least! Can j00 believe it? Phoenix: That must have been tough. Mia: Phoenix. Phoenix: Yeah? Mia: Doesn't something about that seem odd to you? Not at all Phoenix: Well, no, not really. Seems pretty straightforward. Mia: Oh. Perhaps I was wrong, then. Leads back to cross-examination It's a little vague Phoenix: Actually, there is something bothering me. Mr. Manella, just now you said \"steak, at least.\" So you ate something other than steak? Manella: Yeah, good call! I had some chocolate in my pocket, which I used to stave off starvation! Phoenix: I see... (Is that all? I was sure I was on to something there.) Leads back to cross-examination It's contradictory Phoenix: Yeah, it does seem odd, now that you mention it. Mr. Manella! Manella: H-hmm? W-what do j00 mean? *sweats* Phoenix: When I went to Studio Two, I saw something on the table there. (Changed from [When I went to that trailer, I saw something on the table.] in the original release) There were two plates--the same kind of plates as the ones in the Employee Area. (Changed from [There were two plates on the table--the same kind of plates as in the Employee Area.] in the original release) Who ate lunch there? Manella: M-mmpf! No, er, ah, um, eh heh. Good call! *sweats* I, er, I was embarrassed so I didn't mention it... But I did eat, after all. Phoenix: A t-bone steak, you mean? Manella: Yeah, well, I mean the assistant went through all that trouble... I brought it to the trailer thinking I could eat it later. Phoenix: (Clearly a man who likes to eat. I'd suspected as much...) So, when exactly did you eat it? Manella: We took one break during that meeting. I, er, wolfed it down then. *drool* Phoenix: (A mental image I will carry with me to my grave... Wait a second...! If they took a break in that meeting, that contradicts his testimony! I'll press on that one a bit more...) Leads back to cross-examination Manella: We were in the meeting until around 4:00... Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What were you discussing? Manella: The Steel Samurai story, and our budget. Get this! The sponsors turn to me and say, \"Mr. Manella. Those scripts of yours are not appropriate for children.\" Can j00 believe it!? Phoenix: (Actually, I kind of can.) So, nobody left the table during the whole meeting? Manella: During the meeting, well, I'm pretty sure no one left their chairs. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You didn't take a single break? Manella: Er... well... Y-yeah! Not a one! *sweats* Phoenix: (Hmm... what's he sweating so much about, I wonder? If only I had an idea... I'll wait for one to come up and hit him with it later.) Press (after selecting \"It's contradictory\" upon pressing fifth statement) Phoenix: Phoenix: You didn't take a single break? Manella: Er... well... Y-yeah! Not a one! *sweats* Phoenix: (Hmm... what's he sweating so much about, I wonder? If only I had an idea... Wait a second... Maybe I do have an idea!) Press harder Leads to: \"Wait a second!\" Leave him be Phoenix: (No, on second thought, I'm drawing a blank. If I press too hard in the wrong place, I'll just end up scaring him into silence. Maybe I'll just sit back and see what happens.) Leads back to cross-examination Mia: Phoenix. If his alibi holds, Powers is finished. Press him as hard as you can and find out where he's lying! Phoenix: R-right! Phoenix: Wait a second! Mr. Manella, you've just contradicted yourself! Didn't you just tell the court that you ate that t-bone steak during a break? Manella: Oops! ROFL! Phoenix: Well? Manella: Umm... Judge: Mr. Manella, what's this all about? Manella: W-well, yeah, I guess we did take a little break. Mia: Phoenix! Great job! If they took a break, one of them could have gone to the studio during that time! Phoenix: Your Honor! I call on the witness to testify to the court about this break! Judge: Very well. Mr. Manella, your testimony, please. Manella: Urk! Edgeworth: Heh heh heh... Phoenix: (Uh oh. Edgeworth is laughing...) Witness Testimony -- The Break -- Manella: Yeah, FWIW, we took a break... ROFL! But it was only 15 minutes! 15! That's only 13 in Base 12! Not enough time for someone to, say, commit murder in Studio One! LOL! That's only just enough time to eat a t-bone steak, if you ask me! *steams* Judge: Hmm... I don't think it would even be enough time for that, but that's just me. Very well. You may begin the cross-examination. Cross Examination -- The Break -- Manella: Yeah, FWIW, we took a break... ROFL! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What time exactly did you take this break? Manella: Hmm... I'd say it was from around 2:30 or so until 2:45. Phoenix: (2:30!!! That's the time of death! So he could have gone to Studio One, killed Hammer, and come back... I guess it's possible, time-wise...) Edgeworth: ... Manella: But it was only 15 minutes! 15! That's only 13 in Base 12! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What were you doing for those 15 minutes? Manella: Eating my t-bone steak! What else!? Phoenix: There were two plates on the trailer table...? Manella: Oh, right. The other one was Diva's... sorry, Dee Vasquez's plate. Phoenix: (Dee Vasquez... the producer.) Edgeworth: To eat a t-bone steak in 15 minutes... that's quite a feat. Manella: Not enough time for someone to, say, commit murder in Studio One! LOL! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why is that? Press (after pressing first statement) Phoenix: Leads to: \"Why is that?\" Manella: That's only just enough time to eat a t-bone steak, if you ask me! *steams* Press Phoenix: Phoenix: I have to say, you look like a guy who gets through his meals pretty fast. Manella: Well, I was facing a cold, slightly chewy t-bone steak... Even I have to take my time eating that kind of food. LOL Mia: Well, Phoenix? Phoenix: That testimony was too short to wring any kind of useful information out of! Mia: All you have to do is prove that he was able to go to Studio One in that time! Phoenix: (Oh, great. Is that all...) Phoenix: Why is that? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Haven't we had enough of this pointless line of questioning? Your Honor! The testimony to this point has made one certain fact painfully clear: The people in the trailer had nothing to do with this murder! It was impossible for any of them to go to Studio One! Phoenix: What!? Edgeworth: Something wrong, Mr. Wright? Surely you aren't suggesting one of the people in the trailer went to Studio One! Judge: Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright? Mia: Phoenix, this is critical! Think about it before you give your answer! Judge: Do you claim someone from the trailer went to Studio One? I claim it, and claim it loud Phoenix: (If I agree to let everyone in that trailer off the hook then the trial is over... Mr. Powers will be found guilty for sure!) The victim was murdered at 2:30, the exact time of the break in the meeting. With 15 minutes, murder is certainly a possibility! Judge: Hmm... I suppose you might say that... Phoenix: (Alright, I've got the judge thinking now!) Edgeworth: Tsk, tsk, tsk... Never a dull moment with you, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: What's your point, Edgeworth! Edgeworth: You've been doing your homework, haven't you? Look at the Court Record. Phoenix: The Court Record...? Edgeworth: Surely, you knew that from 2:15 to 4:00 the path between the studios was blocked? Mrs. Monkey's head had fallen across the path! Phoenix: Whoa! You're right! Edgeworth: True, the break in the trailer meeting came right at the time of death... However! The path from there to the scene of the crime was blocked! The fallen Mrs. Monkey head barred the way! Phoenix: ... (It's actually \"Mr. Monkey,\" but Edgeworth has a point... And somehow, I feel no desire to correct him.) Judge: No counter-argument, Mr. Wright? Then I'm afraid you lose this round. Leads to: \"I believe we have seen enough evidence.\" No, it's impossible. Phoenix: (I don't want to write off so many possible suspects... But I can't keep claiming the impossible, either...) I agree that it was impossible for anyone in the trailer to go to the studio in that time. Edgeworth: Ha hah! I thought you might be thoughtlessly treading on thin ice again! But I see you had at least an inkling of the truth. Judge: What do you mean, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: It's quite simple... True, the break in the trailer meeting came right at the time of death... However! The path from there to the scene of the crime was blocked! The fallen Mrs. Monkey head barred the way! At around 2:15, a strong gust of wind knocked off the studio mascot's head. Ergo! When the people in the trailer took a break at 2:30, the way to the studio was blocked. Blocked... by Mrs. Monkey's severed head! Phoenix: ... (It's actually \"Mr. Monkey,\" but Edgeworth has a point... And somehow, I feel no desire to correct him.) Leads to: \"I believe we have seen enough evidence.\" Edgeworth: I believe we have seen enough evidence. I would like to relieve Mr. Manella from the stand. Phoenix: (Wh-what? It's over?) Judge: Very well. The court's opinion on this case is as follows: We have found that there were several other people in Studio 2 on the day of the murder. However, it is also clear that none of these people could have gone to Studio One. They therefore have no relation to this case. Furthermore, with regards to the photo of the Steel Samurai... Given the size of the costume, no one other than Mr. Powers could have worn it that day. All that is lacking is decisive evidence that he is the one who did it. If we had that, I'm afraid I would have to find Mr. Powers guilty. Edgeworth: Your Honor. The prosecution is pleased to announce that we indeed have decisive evidence: a witness. Judge: Who is this witness, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: My witness saw the very moment when the Steel Samurai skewered the victim! Judge: Order! I will have order! I see. The court will take a 10 minute recess, after which we will hear your witness. Court is adjourned for recess! October 19, 11:04 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1 Mia: ... Phoenix: What do we do now, Mia? If everyone in that trailer has an alibi... Mia: ... I'm sorry, Phoenix. I guess I was wrong. Phoenix: M-Mia! Don't tell me you're giving up! If you give up, what hope do I have...? Mia: ... Don't get me wrong. I've never given up on a trial before, not while there was a chance. Only one thing became clear in your cross-examination. The people in the trailer could not have gone to Studio One. I thought there was more to it than that... But I was wrong. That's all there is. Will: Umm... Er... What's going to happen to me? It kinda seems like everyone in that courtroom thinks I did it... They think I'm a murderer! Mia: Don't worry, Mr. Powers. If you are innocent, we will prove it. I guarantee it. Leave it to us, and... be yourself. Be strong. You are the Steel Samurai, hero to children everywhere, after all. Will: I... You... Thanks. *sniff* Mia: Okay, Phoenix. This one's for the kids! Let's do it! October 19, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4 Judge: Court is back in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers. Edgeworth: The prosecution has a concern. As our witness is a grade schooler of tender years, and this is a murder case... we worry that the defense might cause unnecessary trauma with his cruel questioning. (Changed from [We worry that the defense might cause unnecessary trauma with his cruel questioning!] in the original release) Phoenix: (Nice to see Edgeworth taking the moral high ground...) Edgeworth: However, we have no choice. The prosecution calls Cody Hackins to the stand. Edgeworth: Your Honor. Perhaps you could arrange a box for him to stand on? Judge: Oh, r-right. Guard, please bring him a box. One of those donut crates should do. Edgeworth: Will the witness state his name and grade in school. Cody: ... Edgeworth: Witness! Cody: What!? Just 'cause you're all grown-up don't mean you can push me around! Edgeworth: Mrph... Mia: Cody? Answer his question, okay? Cody: H-hey, it's you! The nice lady! I'm Cody Hackins. I'm in 2nd grade! Phoenix: (I get the feeling this is going to be a long, long day...) Judge: Mr. Edgeworth. Please remember that you're speaking to a child. Try to be gentle. Edgeworth: M-mrrrrph! Witness! Er, I mean, Cody. Phoenix: (He's having trouble with this \"gentle\" thing.) Edgeworth: You were present, er, you were at Global Studios on the day of the, er, incident? Cody: You got a problem with that!? Edgeworth: Please tell us what you saw that day. Cody: What, pops? You want me to tell you and gramps with the beard over there? Edgeworth: Just.. Mr. Edgeworth will be fine. Judge: I prefer \"bearded gentleman\" myself. Phoenix: (A very long day...) Judge: Incidentally, photographic equipment is strictly forbidden in this courtroom. Edgeworth: M-mpht! M-my apologies, Your Honor. He said he wouldn't testify if he couldn't bring it... I'd like special permission, if that's possible. Phoenix: Wait, so you're saying you had to bargain terms with a kid... and you LOST? Cody: Hey! I just got this new camera! Don't really know how to use it all that good yet! But I bring it with me wherever I go! Mia: Phoenix. I wonder if he had that camera on the day of the murder... You'd better make a note of it in the Court Record. Cody's Camera added to the Court Record. Judge: Very well, Cody. Please testify to the court about what you saw the day of the incident. Witness Testimony -- Witness's Account -- Cody: I wanted to see a Steel Samurai rehearsal, just once. I found a map on the Internet, and went to the studios that day. I went through the woods off the path, so that old lady wouldn't catch me. I was going for the studio. I got kinda lost on the way, though. For about 30 minutes. When I came out by the studio, there was the Steel Samurai! It totally rocked! Right before my eyes, out came the bad guy! Of course, the Steel Samurai took him down! Pow! If I had my camera with me, that woulda been the time for a shot, I tell you. Anyway, I couldn't get into the studio, so I went home. Judge: Hmm... Very well. The defense may begin its cross-examination. But be gentle. Remember you're talking to a child. (Changed from [And, be gentle. Remember you're talking to a child.] in the original release) Cody: ... Phoenix: (This kid is tougher than most adults we see in here, honestly...) Cross Examination -- Witness's Account -- Cody: I wanted to see a Steel Samurai rehearsal, just once. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You really like the Steel Samurai, huh? Cody: Course I do! I've taped every show! And I go to all the live performances! Phoenix: That's impressive. Have you been to the amusement park? Cody: Course! Duh! My Dad always takes me! Phoenix: (Poor, poor Dad...) Cody: I found a map on the Internet, and went to the studios that day. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Was that day the first time you'd been to the studio? Cody: Uh, actually I've been a couple of times. I never manage to get there on a rehearsal day! And that security lady's always yelling... Edgeworth: Right, right. Please continue. Cody: Chill, pops! I'm getting to it! How am I supposed to talk with you cuttin' me off all the time? Geez! Edgeworth: ... Cody: I went through the woods, off the path, so that old lady wouldn't catch me. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Off the path\"...? Cody: Yeah, you know how the studios are in a valley there? If you go off the path a little, there's woods. That's where I was! Phoenix: I see. Cody: Anyhow... Cody: I was going for the studio. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Did nothing unusual happen on your way to the studio? Cody: \"Unusual\"? Phoenix: Did you see this monkey by any chance? Cody: Oh, you mean Mr. Monkey? Yeah I saw him, but his head wasn't busted! Edgeworth: So you went straight to the studio? Cody: I got kinda lost on the way, though. For about 30 minutes. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You got lost in the woods? Cody: Yeah. I couldn't figure out which way I was walking. Man, was I relieved when I saw the blue studio doors. But guess what happened next! Cody: When I came out by the studio, there was the Steel Samurai! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The Steel Samurai? Cody: Yeah, he was standing by the studio gate. It looked like he was thinking about something before going in. Then he opened up the gate and went inside. Phoenix: I see. What then? Cody: It totally rocked! Right before my eyes, out came the bad guy! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What sort of \"bad guy\" was it? Cody: A guy. A person. Kinda tall. Skinny. Phoenix: Are you sure it was a guy? Cody: ... I dunno. He was kinda far away. Phoenix: (Huh, he's being awfully vague...) Mia: ... Cody: Of course, the Steel Samurai took him down! Pow! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What happened to the bad guy? Cody: Huh? Well... Well, he kinda didn't move. Not a bit. Like he was dead. I-I guess he's a real pro! What a great actor! Phoenix: Y-yes, I suppose he was. Cody: If I had my camera with me, that woulda been the time for a shot, I tell you. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"If\" you had your camera? You mean, you weren't carrying your camera then? Cody: N-no, I wasn't. I-it's not like I have it all the time! Phoenix: (Really...?) Present Cody's Camera Phoenix: Leads to: \"Cody, what you just said seems, well, a little strange.\" Phoenix: (I guess seeing the killing freaked him out and he went home...) Mia: Phoenix. Remember, he's a child. Use gentle words... but be firm. Phoenix: (Easy for you to say...) Phoenix: Cody, what you just said seems, well, a little strange. Didn't you say before that you always bring your digital camera wherever you go? You were quite clear about that. Cody: Huh!? Phoenix: Cody, you shouldn't lie here. You understand that, right? Judge: Mr. Wright! A word with you... Phoenix: (Uh oh... was I putting the pressure on too much?) Judge: What is this \"digital\" camera contraption you're talking about? Phoenix: It's umm... a digital camera, Your Honor. It's kind of a new sort of camera. (How do I explain that!?) Judge: I see. Phoenix: Anyway, Cody... I can't believe you wouldn't bring your camera on a trip to the studios! You did bring it, didn't you? Cody: Umm... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Mr. Wright! How cruel you are, to terrorize a poor child so! Phoenix: I don't care if he's a child or a prosecuting attorney! No one should lie in court! Edgeworth: What do you mean \"or a prosecuting attorney\"!? Phoenix: Well, Cody? Cody: Wh-what! Yeah, so I had my camera. So what!? You got a problem with that!? Judge: So, you did have a camera? And did you use this camera? Cody: W-why would I use it? I... I was too busy watching. Judge: Hmm... Very well. Please testify to the court about what you were so busy watching. Witness Testimony -- What I Saw -- Cody: Y-yeah, I had my camera with me. But I was glued to the action! I couldn't take my eyes off it! The Steel Samurai, he goes for the bad guy... wham! Then... then the bad guy stopped moving! He's so strong! The Steel Samurai rules! Judge: Hmm... Ah? Is that all? Well, that was brief. Mr. Wright, your cross-examination. Cross Examination -- What I Saw -- Cody: Y-yeah, I had my camera with me. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, why didn't you use it? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: He's getting to that! Relax and listen. Cody: Umm... I didn't use it 'cause I was too busy watching the real thing! Cody: But I was glued to the action! I couldn't take my eyes off it! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you were watching the Steel Samurai. Did you watch the whole fight? Cody: Y-yeah, of course! Phoenix: You didn't turn away, not even once? Cody: N... no! Phoenix: Okay, then tell us exactly what happened. Cody: Y-yeah! I'm getting to that! Cody: The Steel Samurai, he goes for the bad guy... wham! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So the bad guy attacked him first? Cody: Yeah! Phoenix: What sort of person was this \"bad guy\"? Cody: I told you, a person. He was a person. Phoenix: How was he dressed? Cody: ... I kinda don't remember. I was too busy watching the Steel Samurai! Edgeworth: I see. And what happened next? Cody: Then... then the bad guy stopped moving! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why? Cody: Huh? Whaddya mean, \"why\"? Phoenix: Why wasn't the bad guy moving? Cody: W-well 'cause the Steel Samurai brought him to justice! Phoenix: And how exactly did he do that? Cody: H-how did he do it? With a Samurai Kick! And a Samurai Punch! Samurai Chop! ... Samurai Slap! S-something like that. Phoenix: (He's still being vague about this...) Cody: What! Don't gimme that look, pops! Phoenix: (How should I play this?) Wait and see what happens Phoenix: (Yeah... If I press too hard now, the judge might keep me from continuing. I'll sit back and see how the rest of this goes.) Leads back to cross-examination Press him harder Leads to: \"Cody.\" Cody: He's so strong! The Steel Samurai rules! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What did you do after the bad guy fell, Cody? Cody: ... Um, actually... The fight was so... so intense that I got kinda scared. So I went straight home. Phoenix: (Something isn't adding up here...) Phoenix: (Something about his account doesn't seem right...) Mia: Phoenix. It doesn't seem right because he's being deliberately vague! Press him on the facts, Phoenix! Find out what he saw! Phoenix: Cody. Cody: Wh-what!? Phoenix: Something's bothering me. Before you said that you \"couldn't take your eyes off\" the action. Cody: Y-yeah? So what? Phoenix: Yet you missed the most important part! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What is the meaning of this? The witness has stated what he saw quite clearly... Phoenix: Phoenix: You know as well as I do that he's being vague! Tell me, what kind of murderer uses a \"Samurai Slap\"!? Edgeworth: M-mmph! Phoenix: My point is this: Cody, you may have seen some of the Steel Samurai's fight... But you missed the most important part: the killing blow! Judge: Order! Order! Mr. Wright! How could this be? Can you explain how he might have missed something so vital? Phoenix: Um, well... er, that's the thing... Mia: Phoenix! I believe you're on the right track with this! Think: why didn't Cody see the climax of the fight? I know you! You can figure this out! Judge: Mr. Wright, your answer! We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai... Why wouldn't he watch the climax of the fight? He couldn't watch it Phoenix: Because he couldn't watch it! How could he calmly watch a murder taking place at his age! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Just a moment, please... One thing has become quite clear in this boy's testimony. He did not believe he was witnessing a murder! He was watching the Steel Samurai fight, like on TV. The more real the fight, the more he would have watched! Phoenix: Umm... huh. Judge: I have to agree with Mr. Edgeworth. Well, Mr. Wright. Do you have another explanation? Leads back to: \"We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai...\" He was watching something else Phoenix: He missed the climax of the fight... because he was looking at something else! Probably! Edgeworth: \"Probably\"? Judge: \"Something else\"? Edgeworth: Mr. Wright, explain yourself! What could possibly distract this boy from seeing his idol, the Steel Samurai, fight!? What do you claim he was looking at? Phoenix: O-ooof! (C'mon, think of something... think of something... Nothing.) Judge: Mr. Wright! Please refrain from making baseless claims! Phoenix: Y-yes... Sorry, Your Honor. Judge: Do you have another explanation for this? Leads back to: \"We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai...\" Show evidence Phoenix: Your Honor, I have evidence. Judge: \"Evidence\"...? Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. Why did Cody look away from the fight? Present Cody's Camera Phoenix: Leads to: \"Here's my proof!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Here's my proof! Judge: Proof? Phoenix: Um, uh... Can I... do that again? (This doesn't prove anything...!) Edgeworth: Hah! Lost your nerve, have you? Judge: Very well... I'll ask you the question again. Leads back to: \"We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai...\" Phoenix: Here's my proof! Judge: What's that? The camera...? Phoenix: The witness stated that he recently received this camera. Judge: Yes, I'm aware of that. Phoenix: He wasn't entirely familiar with its operation. Judge: I'm aware of that, too. Ah! Phoenix: Correct! Why would Cody be looking somewhere else at the critical moment? Because he was looking at his camera! He was trying to take a picture! Cody: Hey! Phoenix: Bullseye! Cody: W-what's your problem, pops! You got a thing for picking on little kids!? Phoenix: (Pressing, not picking...) Mia: Good job, Phoenix! Cody was lying, clearly. Smart of you to realize there was no way he could just stand there, watching his hero... and not take a picture! Phoenix: Right! Cody? There was only one reason why you would have looked away from the fight. And that was because you wanted to take a picture. But having just received your camera, you weren't used to using it yet! So, you missed the climax of the fight. Correct? Cody: ... ... ... Yeah. Mia: Well, Phoenix. I'll bet you anything he's hiding more than that. Have him testify again! Phoenix: R-right. (Mia means business!) Your Honor. The defense would like to request that Cody Hackins testify once more. Judge: V-very well. Cody? Could you please tell us about your camera... And about why you didn't take a picture of the fight? Cody: Umm... Phoenix: (Welcome to the real world, kid!) Witness Testimony -- No Photo? -- Cody: Yeah, you're right, pops. The Steel Samurai had just escaped from the clutches of the villain. So I held up my camera to take a picture! But the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it. Th-that's all that happened. Yup. Judge: Hmm... Anything strange in that testimony, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: I'm not sure... But I'd like to proceed with the cross-examination anyway. Cross Examination -- No Photo? -- Cody: Yeah, you're right, pops. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Pops\"...? Cody: Yeah, I called you \"pops,\" you spiky-haired geezer! Phoenix: G-geezer...? Edgeworth: I'm \"Mr. Edgeworth.\" Judge: And I guess I'm the \"bearded gentleman\"... Cody: That's what I hate about grown-ups. You're all so self-conscious! Phoenix: Okay, off with the kid gloves! Testify, witness, testify! Cody: Yipes! Cody: The Steel Samurai had just escaped from the clutches of the villain. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you did see the beginning of the fight? Cody: Yeah. Phoenix: Did you notice anything unusual? Cody: Umm... well... uh... I guess the Steel Samurai was moving a little strange... Phoenix: (Moving... strangely?) Cody: So I held up my camera to take a picture! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why couldn't you take a picture? Cody: My new camera has too many buttons. I couldn't figure it out. I tried to take a picture, I really tried. Cody: But the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: When the lens opened, what did you see? Cody: Uh... well, a person on the ground. And the Steel Samurai! Cody: Th-that's all that happened. Yup. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: That's all? Cody: Y-yeah! I told you, I didn't take a picture! Phoenix: (Hmm... I would have, once I got that lens open... Did he really not take a picture? Not even one?) Press him hard Phoenix: (Nah, he definitely would have taken a picture. There's got to be something here I can use!) Cody! Listen up, Cody Hackins. I know exactly what happened that day. You took a picture! Cody: ... Hey! Phoenix: (Bullseye...?) Cody: H-how did you know!? Phoenix: I see through all your lies Cody Hackins. It's one of my powers! Cody: W-wow! Phoenix: (This feels great!) Cody: Y-yeah... Yeah, I took a picture. Judge: Perhaps you can change your testimony to reflect this, Cody? Changes statement from \"Th-that's all that happened. Yup.\" to \"I took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em.\" Let it slide Phoenix: (He looks ready to burst into tears... I'd better lay off him for now.) Leads back to cross-examination Cody: I took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You \"erased\" them? Cody: Y-yeah! Phoenix: Why would you erase a picture of your beloved Steel Samurai, victorious? Cody: Well... y'know. W-why would I want to keep a picture like that? Phoenix: (Hmm... he's becoming less and less cooperative. I better find a clear contradiction soon... or some solid evidence.) Present \"Path to Glory\" Phoenix: Leads to: \"Cody!\" Phoenix: (How can I pick holes in such a short testimony?) Mia: There has to be something. Dig up the dirt, Phoenix! Find out what this kid's all about! Phoenix: Cody! Cody: Wh-wh-what!? Man, every time you say \"Cody\" you follow it with something bad. Phoenix: I just wanted to thank you for giving me this the other day. Cody: Huh? O-oh... right. Phoenix: What was it you told me then? Cody: I go to every live performance! I always take a picture when the Steel Samurai lands the final blow! Whizzam! I got 'em all! I never missed one! A perfect collection! Phoenix: Cody. Did you really get a picture of the Steel Samurai standing victorious over his foe? If you did, I find it hard to believe that you would just erase it! Wouldn't you keep it for your album? Cody: Ah! Judge: Mr. Wright... What exactly is this album? Phoenix: It's called \"Path to Glory.\" It's a collection of pictures of the Steel Samurai, all taken by Cody Hackins. He claims it's a perfect collection of every battle the Steel Samurai has won! Judge: I... I see. Phoenix: Don't you find this very odd, Your Honor? Among all his pictures of the Steel Samurai, none were taken that day! Judge: Order! Mr. Wright. Have you an explanation? If the Steel Samurai had just defeated his adversary... I certainly would expect to see a picture of it in this album... Phoenix: Exactly my point, Your Honor! ... ... .........! (No... wait... no way!) Mia: Phoenix? I think we've finally discovered the truth. And what a truth it is! Phoenix: M-Mia... are we sure about this? Did he actually...? Mia: Yes. I'm pretty sure what you're thinking is right. Tell them, Phoenix. Tell them what the truth is. Judge: Mr. Wright! Please explain to the court what is going on here! Why was there no picture in the album from the day of the murder? Why would the boy have erased the photos he took? The photos were blurry Phoenix: I believe that Cody Hackins is what we call an \"artiste.\" Judge: An... \"artiste\"...? Phoenix: He didn't like the photos he had taken! They were blurry, or maybe his framing was off... Anyway, for some reason, he erased the data! Judge: Is that right, Cody? Cody: Wh-what do you mean \"framing was off\"!? Judge: It seems the only thing \"off\" is your guesswork, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Um, uh... Yes, well, I'm sure the real reason is... Judge: Yes? The real reason is? Leads back to: \"Why was there no picture in the album from the day of the murder?\" He erased them by mistake Phoenix: Simple, Your Honor. Cody wasn't used to using his new camera. He erased those photos he took by mistake! Mia: W-wait a second, Phoenix. If that's your answer, we're back where we started! Phoenix: Huh? You mean, that wasn't it? Judge: Mr. Wright! If you have something to say to the court, speak up! Phoenix: Um, well... S-sorry, Your Honor. Can I change my answer? Judge: Hmm... *sigh* Leads back to: \"Why was there no picture in the album from the day of the murder?\" The Steel Samurai didn't win Leads to: \"I can think of only one reason, Your Honor.\" Phoenix: I can think of only one reason, Your Honor. The Steel Samurai didn't win! That's why Cody deleted those photos. Judge: You mean the Steel Samurai... lost? Phoenix: Well, Cody? I'm right, aren't I? Tell the truth. The bad guy defeated the Steel Samurai! Cody: N-n-n-no way! No! I-it's impossible! Th-the Steel Samurai never loses! He never loses to anyone! Ever! Phoenix: Your Honor... The witness has revealed everything with his words. There was a reason why he lied and told us he didn't take a picture. The same reason he erased his precious photos! For Cody, it was inconceivable that the Steel Samurai could be defeated. However, Cody witnessed the impossible! He saw the Steel Samurai lose! Yet to admit what he saw would destroy everything he believed in! That's why he lied and said the Steel Samurai won. He couldn't handle the truth! Judge: O-Order! I will have order! W-witness! I mean, Cody! Is this true!? W-what did you see? Tell the court what you saw! Cody: I...... Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh! Phoenix: Cody... That day, you saw the Steel Samurai lose a fight. Right? Cody: Waaaaaaaaaaaaah! Okay okay! Y-you're right! Th-the Steel Samurai f-fell down... Th-then he didn't m-move... Waaaaaaaaah! Judge: Order! Order! Order! Edgeworth: What kind of stunt are you trying to pull, Wright!? The Steel Samurai was the murderer, not the victim! Phoenix: Yet according to your witness's testimony, the Steel Samurai was the one who fell! Judge: Mr. Wright! What's going on? Phoenix: Apparently, we have all made a serious error. Edgeworth: An... error? What's this all about!? Hammer was the victim Phoenix: Quite simply, the victim was Jack Hammer! Judge: ... Edgeworth: ... ... Judge: Umm... Mr. Wright? We all know that. Phoenix: Right. Judge: Perhaps you'd like to reconsider your last statement? Phoenix: ... I'm sorry. It was I who was wrong. Edgeworth: Okay, Wright! First you're right, now you're wrong!? Which is it!? Phoenix: L-look, I'm sure there's something we're overlooking! Edgeworth: If you're so sure, then tell us what it is! Leads back to: \"What's this all about!?\" Steel Samurai was the victim Leads to: \"If you understand what really happened, it's actually quite simple.\" There was no victim Phoenix: There was no victim in this case! Judge: Wh-wh-what!? Has the defense taken leave of its senses!? Phoenix: Of course, Jack Hammer died. But the Steel Samurai fell too! It was a draw! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ... Sorry. I was too shocked to say anything for a bit there. Listen, Wright! Only one person died in this incident, and that is Jack Hammer! Yet now you claim there \"was no victim\"? Are you insane? Phoenix: (Uh oh, he's pulling out all the stops now.) ... I'm sorry. It was I who was wrong. Edgeworth: Okay, Wright! First you're right, now you're wrong!? Which is it!? Phoenix: L-look, I'm sure there's something we're overlooking! Edgeworth: If you're so sure, then tell us what it is! Leads back to: \"What's this all about!?\" Phoenix: If you understand what really happened, it's actually quite simple. At the end of the fight, the Steel Samurai fell to the ground, and lay still. In other words, the Steel Samurai was not the killer, he was the victim! Don't you see? Jack Hammer was the Steel Samurai! Judge: Order! Order! Order! So, the Steel Samurai in this photograph... You're saying the man in this costume was the victim, Mr. Jack Hammer? Phoenix: That's what I'm saying, Your Honor. Jack Hammer was present at the action scene run-through that morning. Thus, he obviously knew about Will Powers's foot injury. Judge: B-but wait! Hadn't Mr. Hammer gone to Studio One already? Phoenix: That's what everyone thought! But remember what Ms. Oldbag said in her testimony? Oldbag: On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM. Did I see poor old Hammer? Nope. He'd already gone to the studio before I got back to the guard station. Phoenix: Mr. Jack Hammer left the Employee Area after lunch. However, no one saw him going to Studio One. Nor was there a picture of him. He waited for Mr. Powers to take a nap in his dressing room. Then he snuck into the dressing room and stole the Steel Samurai costume. Judge: ... Edgeworth: ... Judge: But why would the victim do such a thing? Phoenix: I... don't know. Cody: ... I get it! Phoenix: ? Cody: I thought that the Steel Samurai was moving strange. So it was a different person inside the suit! Pops! Phoenix: Huh, me? What? Cody: Actually, there was one piece of data I saved. Phoenix: Data? Cody: Yeah, a photo on my digital camera! Phoenix: ! W-what!? Edgeworth: Show us, quick! Cody: No way man, not if you're gonna look at me like that! Judge: Now! Cody: *sniff* Here... This is it. Judge: ... Well, looking at this it's still a little hard to say. I'm afraid that it could be anyone in that costume. Your opinion, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: I agree, Your Honor. This isn't decisive evidence. Judge: I'm sorry, this doesn't look like it's the proof we need. I'll give it back. Mia: Wait, Phoenix! Phoenix: Mia? What? Mia: Look at that photo once more! That's it Phoenix! That photo is all the evidence you need to win this trial! Phoenix: Wh-what!? Y-Your Honor! May I see that photo once more please? Judge: C-certainly. I don't see why not. Mia: Phoenix! Show him! There's a glaring, decisive inconsistency with the facts as we know them in that photo! Phoenix: (Find the inconsistency in the photo!) Present number \"2\" sign Phoenix: Leads to: \"Your Honor! Look at this!\" Present Steel Samurai Phoenix: Phoenix: It's right here! Judge: The Steel Samurai...? Phoenix: Yes, that's about the only thing in this picture that could be inconsistent. The Steel Samurai is inconsistent with... something. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Wright! This is no time for daydreaming and pointless pontification! Think about your client, and us, who are forced to listen to your rambling! Judge: Mr. Wright, please rethink your position. Leads back to: \"Find the inconsistency in the photo!\" Present anywhere else Phoenix: Phoenix: I think it's here. Judge: You seem to be lacking even more confidence than usual. Phoenix: I suppose that's because I'm not confident about it at all. Judge: Maybe you want to rethink your case, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yes, please, Your Honor. Leads back to: \"Find the inconsistency in the photo!\" Phoenix: Your Honor! Look at this! Judge: I see... a gate? Phoenix: Might I draw your attention to the number on that gate? Judge: The number? Ah yes. Well, it's hard to see, but it looks like a \"2.\" Phoenix: Clearly not a \"1,\" Your Honor, correct? Edgeworth: Aaaaaah! Phoenix: I believe Mr. Edgeworth sees what I'm getting at. Edgeworth: B-but... Th-that's impossible! Judge: Hmm? Eh? What's this all about? Please explain so that I might be shocked along with the rest of the court. Phoenix: I'll use the studio guidemap. The body was found here, in Studio One. However, what do we see in this photo taken at the time of the murder? It does NOT say \"1\" on that gate in the photo. Your Honor! Here is the true scene of the crime! (Show the judge where the murder took place!) Present Studio Two Phoenix: Leads to: \"Here, at Studio Two.\" Present anywhere else Phoenix: Phoenix: It was here! Judge: What does that have to do with the number on the gate in the photograph...? Phoenix: Umm... well... Sorry, Your Honor, I guess I hadn't thought it that far through yet. Judge: Think it through before you point at the map this time, Mr. Wright! Once again! Where is he scene of this crime? Leads back to: \"Show the judge where the murder took place!\" Phoenix: Here, at Studio Two. Judge: I see! That would explain the \"2\" on the gate in the photo. Phoenix: Your Honor, I find it very significant that the murder took place in Studio Two! The trailer is there Phoenix: As you may recall, there is a trailer in Studio Two. Now, on that day, a meeting was held in that very trailer. There was a break in the meeting corresponding to the time of death. During that break, Mr. Sal Manella and Ms. Dee Vasquez were outside, eating steak. They were at the scene of the crime! The path to the trailer was blocked! Judge: So we have heard. Phoenix: The path was blocked at 2:15... In other words, the victim went to Studio Two before that time! Judge: Yes... yes, I suppose that would be the case. Phoenix: Remember Mr. Sal Manella's testimony? Allow me to remind the court: He said no one in the trailer was guilty because they could not have gone to Studio One. Yet, in actuality, the reverse was true! Only someone in the trailer could have committed this murder! They were the only ones with access to the scene of the crime: Studio Two! Leads to: \"O-order! Order!\" The path was blocked Phoenix: The path to the trailer was blocked! Judge: So we have heard. Phoenix: The path was blocked at 2:15... In other words, the victim went to Studio Two before that time! Judge: Yes... yes, I suppose that would be the case. Phoenix: Remember Mr. Sal Manella's testimony? Allow me to remind the court: He said no one in the trailer was guilty because they could not have gone to Studio One. Yet, in actuality, the reverse was true! Only someone in the trailer could have committed this murder! They were the only ones with access to the scene of the crime: Studio Two! As you may recall, there is a trailer in Studio Two. Now, on that day, a meeting was held in that very trailer. There was a break in the meeting corresponding to the time of death. During that break, Mr. Sal Manella and Ms. Dee Vasquez were outside, eating steak. They were at the scene of the crime! Leads to: \"O-order! Order!\" No filming is done there Phoenix: Studio Two is no longer being used for filming! Judge: I see... And this is significant... why? Phoenix: (Good question! I really should think these things through more.) Judge: Would you like to take another stab at it? So to speak? Phoenix: S-stabbing away, Your Honor. Leads back to: \"Your Honor, I find it very significant that the murder took place in Studio Two!\" Judge: O-order! Order! Phoenix: The defense makes the following claims: The scene of the crime was Studio Two! The person that the security guard, Ms. Oldbag saw was the victim, Mr. Jack Hammer! Mr. Hammer, for some reason, stole a Steel Samurai costume. Then he went to Studio Two! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This is madness! Jack Hammer is the victim! The victim! Why would he steal a Steel Samurai costume!? Are you suggesting he did so to cover up the details of his own murder!? Phoenix: W-well, no, of course not... Judge: Hmm... Edgeworth: Or do you have proof!? Give me proof that the victim, Jack Hammer, stole the costume! I have proof Phoenix: I have proof! Edgeworth: Y-you do!? Judge: You do, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: (Now that they're so surprised suddenly I'm much less confident... I think I'm right, though!) Leads to: \"Here's my proof that Jack Hammer stole the costume!\" I don't have proof Phoenix: (Proof? Uh oh... I'm pretty sure I don't have anything like that...) Mia: Phoenix. Even if you're not 100% sure about this, you have to try. And I think you've got proof that's good enough to win them over! Just go for it! All or nothing! Phoenix: Your Honor... Judge: Yes, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Actually... I do have proof. Leads to: \"Here's my proof that Jack Hammer stole the costume!\" Phoenix: Here's my proof that Jack Hammer stole the costume! Present Empty Bottle Phoenix: Leads to: \"This is it.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: (Wait, no, that can't be right... I've got to have some proof that will knock their socks off...) Judge: Mr. Wright! We don't have all the time in the world, here. Phoenix: Y-yes, Your Honor! Leads back to: \"Here's my proof that Jack Hammer stole the costume!\" Phoenix: This is it. Judge: An empty... medicine bottle? Phoenix: I found this on the table in the Employee Area. The same table where Mr. Hammer and Mr. Powers ate. The label reads \"sleeping pills.\" Judge: \"Sleeping pills\"...? Phoenix: The defendant, Mr. Powers, spent that entire afternoon sleeping. He was drugged... by Mr. Hammer! Judge: Wait a moment... That bottle does raise some suspicions, yes. But there is no proof that Mr. Hammer used it. Phoenix: Your Honor, I have an idea. Test Powers's blood Judge: An... idea? Continue. Phoenix: Run a test of Powers's blood. You should find traces of the sleeping pills. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This much time after the day of the murder!? Even if there were traces it still proves nothing! No blood test could tell that Hammer was the one who drugged him, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (He's right. Darn. That didn't work. Time to try another idea.) Leads back to: \"Your Honor, I have an idea.\" Fingerprint the bottle Leads to: \"An... idea? Very well, let's hear it.\" Examine Hammer's body Judge: An idea, Mr. Wright? And that would be? Phoenix: Er... we should examine Mr. Hammer's body. Judge: Mr. Hammer...? I thought that it was Mr. Powers who was made to take the sleeping pills? Phoenix: I-indeed it was, Your Honor. (Wrong again...) Leads back to: \"Your Honor, I have an idea.\" Judge: An... idea? Very well, let's hear it. Phoenix: I want to check this bottle for fingerprints! If my claim is true, Mr. Hammer's fingerprints should show up on this bottle! Edgeworth: Hmm... Judge: I suppose you're right. Very well. The court will take possession of the bottle. Empty Bottle given to the judge. Judge: This court will suspend proceedings on the current trial for today. Cody Hackin's [sic] testimony has revealed new possibilities in this case. In fact, things may have happened very differently than we previously thought. The Steel Samurai seen by Ms. Oldbag may have been the victim, Jack Hammer. The scene of the crime was not Studio One, but Studio Two. And those in the trailer did have time to commit murder. Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor? Judge: Your homework is to find the answer to the following question: Why would Mr. Hammer steal the Steel Samurai costume? Also, who killed him, and why? Find the answers for me by tomorrow. Phoenix: (That's a lot of homework!) Judge: Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Mm? Judge: You will need to reconsider your stance in this case. Above all, you will need to reconsider your suspicion of Mr. Will Powers. Edgeworth: As you say, Your Honor. Judge: This trial will be extended until tomorrow. This is the last extension! Very well... Court is adjourned! October 19, 2:47 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1 Phoenix: Whew! That was a close one! Mia: We were saved by a hair, but that's all that counts. I thought seriously about going home about three times during the trial. Phoenix: M-me too! Will: Really? You both seemed so... so confident! Phoenix: Hah! Maybe I should take up a career in acting? I was ready to pronounce you dead about three times back there. Mia: Me too! Will: D-dead!? Mia: Hoh hoh. Of course, we're kidding. Will: Are you sure? Phoenix: (I wasn't kidding...) Now, Mr. Powers. We have to go make our final investigation. But I promise you, we'll find the true killer by tomorrow's trial! Will: R-right! Thanks! *sniff* To be continued. Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement? Judge: Uh... I'm not sure I follow? Phoenix: It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought... Judge: You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence! Judge: ...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory... Phoenix: Huh? Really? Judge: Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (Whoops! That didn't go so well.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor! Judge: How exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...? Phoenix: They aren't, are they... Judge: Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor! Judge: ... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Ugh, I must be on the wrong track?) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! This court see no reason to further prolong the trial. Phoenix: (Uh oh...) Judge: This court finds the defendant, Mr. Will Powers... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned! Turnabout Samurai Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 Part 5 Part 6 October 19, 3:27 PMWright & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: That was a close one, huh, Mia? Maya: Really? Too bad, I'm sorry I missed it. Phoenix: ? M-Maya! Maya: So, what happened? Phoenix: Well, I think I've got a pretty good idea who did it. Now all I need is a motive... and proof. Maya: Wow! Good going, Nick! Phoenix: Under the \"initial trial\" system, tomorrow is the last day we have. Maya: \"Initial trial\"...? What's that? Phoenix: That's the new court system they introduced two or three years ago. They had so many cases in the system, they decided to speed the whole process up. Maya: So, under that system, trials have to end in three days? Phoenix: Yeah, pretty much. Well, we've no time to waste! Talk The Steel Samurai Phoenix: I don't get it, Maya. Why would Mr. Hammer steal the Steel Samurai costume? Maya: What!? You mean Mr. Hammer was wearing the costume!? Phoenix: Yeah! Maya: B-but Mr. Hammer was the victim, Nick! Why would he go through the trouble of stealing it? Phoenix: That's what we have to find out. The director's alibi Maya: What happened with the director's testimony? Phoenix: Well, it's pretty clear that the producer and the director were both in the trailer. Maya: Huh... Phoenix: Which means that the killer has to be one of them! Maya: Really!? Why? Phoenix: Because the real scene of the crime was Studio Two... where that trailer is! Maya: Whaaaat!? Phoenix: (Hmm... was Maya always this excitable?) Any ideas Phoenix: Well, have you noticed anything that might help us? Maya: I can't see what's going on when Mia is here... So, no. I haven't noticed anything. Phoenix: Right... Maya: Maybe we should go talk to WP? Phoenix: (WP... Powers... right.) Present Powers's(?) Photo Phoenix: (Who would have thought that it was Jack Hammer inside! But why did he steal it? That's what I have to figure out.) Maya: ...? Samurai Spear Maya: I wish I had my own Samurai Spear! Just think, I could poke you as much as I wanted! Phoenix: Me!? Why me!? \"Path to Glory\" Phoenix: What do you think about this? It's that fanboy's prized possession. Maya: Wow! Impressive! ... It's a little different from the Steel Samurai on TV... Phoenix: These are mostly taken at those PR shows they do at stores and fairs... I'm pretty sure it's not even Will Powers inside that suit. Maya: No true fan would be satisfied with anything less than the real thing! He's still a child, I suppose... I guess it takes an adult to appreciate the real deal. Right, Nick? Phoenix: Um, yeah, whatever you say. Cody's Camera Phoenix: This is Cody's-- Maya: Hey! A digital camera! I'm impressed a kid like him would have something this expensive. Kids these days! Phoenix: (I don't imagine spirit mediums-in-training get a lot of toys...) October 19Detention CenterVisitor's Room Will: Mr. Wright! You did very well again today... Thank you! Phoenix: Oh... thanks. Um, could you not look like you're about to burst into tears...? Maya: Wow, Nick! You must have really wowed 'em in there. Phoenix: And could you wipe that grin off your face? (Changed from [You could stop looking so... vulnerable, too.] in the original release) Maya: Hey, WP! Only one day left! Let's make it count! Will: Yes... Though there's not really anything I can do to help. Maya: Hah hah hah! I'm not really sure what I can do, either. Phoenix: Please... this is no laughing matter. Talk Producer Vasquez Phoenix: Could you tell me more about Ms. Vasquez? Will: Oh... the producer? She's well respected in the industry. They say she's a genius. Maya: A genius...? Will: She's been at Global Studios for five years now. Right or wrong, nobody dares tell her different these days. Phoenix: Why is that? Will: Ever since she came on board, we've had nothing but hits. Global Studios was on its knees, but she picked it up and made it shine. Oh, and... Maya: And... what? Will: N-nothing. Forget it. I... I've only heard rumors, anyhow. Director Manella Phoenix: Can you tell me anything about Mr. Manella? Will: Oh, he used to be a minor straight-to-video director. But something in his work caught Vasquez's eye. She brought the Steel Samurai idea to him. Now everyone knows the name Sal Manella. I hear he's pretty much at her beck and call, though. Whenever she says \"jump!\" he asks \"how high?\" and all that. Phoenix: (I can imagine him being at her beck and call... though I can't imagine him jumping.) Mr. Hammer Maya: I was wondering about Mr. Hammer... He was a big star back in the day, right? But then he just dropped off the face of the Earth. Will: Oh... Yes, you're right. In fact, he was my role model when I started in this business. But he just stopped taking on big roles. That's when he began appearing in little productions at Global... Maya: How could he do that!? I was really looking forward to a sequel to \"Samurai Summer.\" Will: He just gave up being a star five years ago. Actually, now that I think about it... That was right when Ms. Vasquez came to Global. Phoenix: (Five years ago...?) Present Powers's(?) Photo Phoenix: Here's that picture again. Will: I-is that really Jack Hammer inside that suit? Phoenix: He's the only one who it could have been. Will: But why would he...? Maya: Yeah! Why? Phoenix: You're the medium! Why don't you summon up Mr. Hammer's spirit and ask him yourself? Maya: *sigh* Gimme about three more years. Phoenix: (Look at us, the two novices.) \"Path to Glory\" Phoenix: Have you seen this, Mr. Powers? Will: W-what's that!? I've never seen these Steel Samurais in my life... Phoenix: These are the Steel Samurais that appear at live shows. A fanboy collected all these pictures himself. Will: ... Seeing things like this really makes me think... I mean so much to these kids, you know? *sniff* Anything else Will: E-excuse me. Thank you for showing me that, whatever it is. I wish I could think of some way for me to help you... S-sorry. *sniff* October 19Global StudiosMain Gate Oldbag: ... ... ... Maya: The old windbag sure is quiet today. Oldbag: ... Maya: You know, this place is really... peaceful, like this. Oldbag: ... Maya: Nick? I think her guard's down... Phoenix: Y-yeah? Maya: I bet we could even eat those donuts in the guard station... if we wanted. Oldbag: ... You eat, you die. Maya: Whew! She's alive! Talk Producer Vasquez Phoenix: Um, I was wondering about Dee Vasquez, the producer. Oldbag: Oh, the studio bigwigs LOVE her. So she always gets her way. Phoenix: (She seems bitter...) Maya: Do you... not like the producer? Oldbag: Look, the studio people don't want me talking about her, so, sorry. Director Manella Phoenix: Can I ask you about Sal Manella, the director? Oldbag: Sal? He's soft--a pushover. Does whatever Vasquez tells him to. She treats him like dirt, but I think he likes it. Maya: Huh? Why would anyone like being treated like dirt? That doesn't make any sense, does it, Nick? Phoenix: Er... No, no it doesn't, Maya. Mr. Hammer Phoenix: About Mr. Hammer... Oldbag: Arrgh! I heard about what you said today! Cheeky whippersnapper! Poor old Hammer! You'd drag his star down from the sky and stomp on it! Calling him a criminal! A thief! I-I-I-I... I won't forget this!!! Phoenix: (Uh oh, she's really pissed this time!) Oldbag: You listen to me, whippersnapper! My poor old Hammer would never do such a thing! Why would he steal Powers's costume so he could sneak by me? He would never stoop so low! It's impossible! Present Powers's(?) Photo Phoenix: Um, Ms. Oldbag? Oldbag: What!? Get that filth out of my sight! And you're claiming that's poor old Hammer in there!? And I thought you were such an innocent youth... Bah! Anything else Phoenix: Um, Ms. Oldbag? What do you think of this? Oldbag: Think? I'm not in the mood for thinking, thank you very much. October 19Studio One Entrance Maya: Think back, Nick, to the day of the murder... Mr. Hammer put on the Steel Samurai costume. Then he left from here to go to Studio Two...? Phoenix: Right. Maya: But why? I wonder if someone called him...? Like the director, or the producer...? Examine Left path Phoenix: Studio Two is down that way. Studio Two... the real scene of the crime. Maya: Say, Nick, how did you figure that out again? Phoenix: Well... ... Actually, it's a long story, I'll tell you another time. Maya: Aww. Mr. Monkey statue Phoenix: The mascot of Global Studios. Apparently its name is \"Mr. Monkey.\" Security camera Phoenix: This security camera takes photos of everyone who comes through the gate. It doesn't seem to be switched on today. Studio One entrance Phoenix: The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body. I don't have that cardkey anymore, so I can't go in there today. Welcome sign Maya: It says \"Welcome.\" Phoenix: They let people in here when they're not filming, right? Maya: Nick! Let's come here some day! Whaddya say? Phoenix: Sure, if Ms. Oldbag lets us in. October 19Studio Two Entrance Maya: Hey, Nick... It's Ms. Vasquez! Hello? Vasquez: ... Maya: H-E-L-L-O! Vasquez: ... Maya: H! E! L! L! O! Phoenix: M-Maya! You should at least try to be polite... Vasquez: ... I'm watching the clouds. ... Phoenix: (That's all she had to say, apparently...) Examine Lunch table Phoenix: This is where Sal Manella and Dee Vasquez ate. There's nothing left on the plates. Maya: Hey, so they ate t-bone steaks too. ... Phoenix: Something wrong? Maya: I don't know... I'm getting this funny feeling. Something about this just feels... odd, you know? Phoenix: Can't say that I do... Number \"2\" sign Phoenix: There's a big \"2\" painted here. So this is the number in Cody's photograph. And to think, if he hadn't brought that photograph in... Maya: Don't get all teary eyed yet. Flower garden Phoenix: There're some flowers here. Maya: Wow, so pretty! They're taking good care of these. Phoenix: Don't get too close. That fence looks dangerous. Trailer door Phoenix: The trailer door. It's locked. Talk Mr. Hammer Maya: Um, excuse me? Mr. Hammer came here on the day of the murder, and... Vasquez: Shh. Maya: ? Vasquez: Perhaps you didn't hear me. I'm watching the clouds. I'm not interested in talking to you. Maya: Do something, Nick! She's really ticking me off! Phoenix: (Oh dear...) Will Powers Maya: Umm... Mr. Powers wasn't the killer! You don't have to cancel the Steel Samurai! Vasquez: I think I'm tired of the Steel Samurai. Maya: You... you did it! Nick! She did it! She's the killer! My Fey blood speaks to me! I know it! I know it! Phoenix: (Oh dear...) Director Manella Phoenix: Um, I was wondering if you could tell me about Mr. Manella? Vasquez: ... If you must talk about that man... Perhaps you could talk about it in the trailer? By yourselves? Phoenix: (Oh, oh dear...) Present Anything Vasquez: ... Phoenix: (She's not even looking.) Okay. Hey, you look. Maya: Wh-why are you showing that to me, Nick? October 19Studio Two Trailer Maya: ... Wasn't the assistant cleaning up yesterday? Funny, it still seems pretty messy in here. Phoenix: I guess she was still on a high from getting that rare card she needed. Examine Left poster Phoenix: An old movie poster. \"'The Singing Samurai' starring Jack Hammer.\" What the hell do samurai sing about? Chopping off heads? Maya: Oh. My. God. That movie was the best! It's about a samurai who sings his way to fame and fortune! Mr. Hammer was a very accomplished singer, you know. Phoenix: Singing samurai stars... What's next? Ninja ballet? October 19Global StudiosEmployee Area Maya: I guess they're not filming today, either. I did want to see them filming... just one time. Phoenix: This trial will be over and done by tomorrow. You can come see them film later. Maya: I guess... This is where you found that bottle of sleeping pills, right? Phoenix: Uh huh. Maya: I wonder if there're any other clues lying around. Gumshoe: Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarh! No no no! No touchin'! Maya: Eeek! Gumshoe: Oh, sorry, pal. Didn't mean to frighten you. Maya: D-didn't mean...? I almost had a heart attack! Gumshoe: Heh heh. I guess I can be a little dramatique at times... I suppose it's the actor in me... Phoenix: (\"Dramatique\" indeed...) Gumshoe: Ahem. Anyway, I'm here to examine the plate on that table. Phoenix: Wait, are you looking for sleeping pills? Gumshoe: Yeah, pal. Traces thereof. Examine Drain grate Phoenix: That grate's still lying here. Maya: Ah, they've seen wisdom at last! They know if they fixed it I'd just kick it off again. Phoenix: That poor assistant... Lunch table Phoenix: The remains of the employees' lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak. Dressing room door Phoenix: The door to the dressing room. It's not locked. Vending machine Phoenix: Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. Talk The plate Maya: So you're looking for traces of the sleeping pills... how? Gumshoe: For a thorough examination I gotta take the plate back to the precinct. But I have the capabilities to make a cursory examination right here! Our science guy gave me some testing solution. This reacts to sleeping pills, see? If there're traces it'll change color. Maya: Wow! Neat! Well, Detective Gumshoe? What are you waiting for? Gumshoe: Now, now, everything in due time, pal. ... ... ... Well, the testing solution on the plate changed color alright. Phoenix: So the food on this plate had been laced with sleeping pills! (Changed from [So there were sleeping pills on the plate!] in the original release) Gumshoe: Looks like it. Steak Plate added to the Court Record. The plate (subsequent times) Maya: So you're looking for traces of the sleeping pills... how? Gumshoe: For a thorough examination I gotta take the plate back to the precinct. But I have the capabilities to make a cursory examination right here! Our science guy gave me some testing solution. This reacts to sleeping pills, see? If there're traces it'll change color. Maya: Wow! Neat! Well, Detective Gumshoe? What are you waiting for? Gumshoe: Now, now, everything in due time, pal. ... ... ... Well, the testing solution on the plate changed color alright. Phoenix: So the food on this plate had been laced with sleeping pills! (Changed from [So there were sleeping pills on the plate!] in the original release) Gumshoe: Looks like it. The investigation Phoenix: How goes your investigation? Gumshoe: To tell the truth, it's a real mess, pal. Some people think we should pursue the case we already have against Powers... And some people think we should switch suspects! Maya: What do you think, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Well, pal, I hate to admit it... But I'm not sure I buy the case against Mr. Powers any more. I feel kind of bad for Mr. Edgeworth, though. Prosecutor Edgeworth Phoenix: How is Edgeworth doing, anyway? Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth is outta control! (Changed from [Edgeworth is out of control!] in the original release) He was in the waiting room and he crushed this paper cup with hot, hot coffee in it. Phoenix: Whoa... Gumshoe: Talk about burns, pal! Maya: Wow! The fury of Edgeworth! Phoenix: Yeah, crushing paper cups... (Cups... bottles...?) Say, what ever happened with that empty bottle? Gumshoe: Oh, the bottle of sleeping pills? Well, I got some good news for you about that. They found the victim, Jack Hammer's prints on the bottle. Maya: So that means... Gumshoe: Yep, it sounds like the one who put Powers to sleep was none other than... the victim! Phoenix: (So I was right!) Sleeping Pill Bottle added to the Court Record. Prosecutor Edgeworth (subsequent times) Phoenix: How is Edgeworth doing, anyway? Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth is outta control! (Changed from [Edgeworth is out of control!] in the original release) He was in the waiting room and he crushed this paper cup with hot, hot coffee in it. Phoenix: Whoa... Gumshoe: Talk about burns, pal! Maya: Wow! The fury of Edgeworth! Present Steak Plate Gumshoe: It's looking like Will Powers was drugged... I'm going to go back to the precinct to do some more detailed tests. Maya: You're being very... free with your information today, Detective. Gumshoe: Well... don't go telling anyone this, pal. But I was kind of impressed at today's trial, too. Maya: ...! Gumshoe: Most lawyers would've given up after that director's testimony. I think if it'd been anyone but you up there, Powers would be done for by now. Sleeping Pill Bottle Phoenix: Detective, about that bottle... Gumshoe: Oh, that? Talk about embarrassing, pal! I can't believe I missed that on my first sweep for evidence. Don't know how I can apologize to Mr. Edgeworth. Maya: It must be tough being a detective, with all that responsibility... Gumshoe: Oh, heh heh. *blush* Anything else Gumshoe: I'm guessing I know as much about that as you do, pal, i.e. nothing. Before clearing all Talk options in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: October 18Global StudiosDressing Room Maya: Empty dressing rooms like this are kinda lonely, aren't they? Phoenix: I'm sure Mr. Powers will be back soon. He'll be fine... Maya: Y-yeah... Examine Cosmetics Phoenix: There's an array of cosmetics here. This is the wig used in \"Samurai Boogey-Woogey.\" Maya: Wow! You remembered, Nick! Phoenix: Thanks to you... Costume rack Phoenix: There are some regular suits in among the costumes here. Those must be his own clothes. Couch Phoenix: Looks like someone was sleeping here. Maya: Well, we can be pretty sure WP did take a nap here, like he said. Phoenix: I'm not sure being drugged counts as taking a \"nap\"... Mirror Phoenix: They always have mirrors like this in dressing rooms. I always check my hairdo when I look in a mirror. Hmm... not quite as spiky as usual, I see. Bag Phoenix: Mr. Powers's bag. Maya: I hope WP can come pick it up himself, soon. Phoenix: Soon, soon. Table Phoenix: There's a box for snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Hmm. It's completely empty. ... I can feel Maya's eyes burning into the back of my neck. Dressing Room (after clearing all Talk options in Detention Center - Visitor's Room) Penny: Oh! Hello! Maya: What are you doing here? Penny: Oh... I was just cleaning up the dressing room. I guess WP won't be using it anymore, so... Maya: Wha!? What!? Why!? But WP's innocent! Penny: Yes, and I'm really grateful for all you've done. But... This week is the last episode of the Steel Samurai... Maya: What!? Nooooooooooooooooo! Examine Couch Phoenix: Looks like someone was sleeping here. Penny: Oh, sorry. I haven't cleaned up there yet. Bag Phoenix: It's Powers's bag. Penny: I put all of WP's personal belongings in there. He'll be able to come pick them up, right? Phoenix: I'm sure he'll come, yes. Talk Mr. Hammer Phoenix: I was wondering if I could ask you about Mr. Hammer... Penny: Yes? Phoenix: On the day of the murder, he went to Studio Two. Penny: Huh? I thought he went to Studio One? Maya: He stole the Steel Samurai costume, too! Penny: What!? Why would Mr. Hammer do something like that? ... Oh... I guess the rumor must be true, then. Maya: The rumor? Penny: Yeah. Mr. Vasquez, that producer, had some kind of hold on Hammer. She had some dirt on him... He'd do anything she said, apparently. Maya: Some \"dirt\"? What dirt! Penny: ... Dirt. You know, bad stuff. Maya: ... Um, I know what dirt means... Penny: About five years ago, they were filming a movie starring Mr. Hammer. They were using the new studio... Studio Two. Some sort of accident happened during filming. After that, they never used Studio Two again. They left the film set the way it was, too. Phoenix: (The film set...? Was that trailer part of the film set, then?) The last episode Maya: W-what do you mean, the \"last Steel Samurai\"!? Penny: I know it's a shock, but nothing can be done to save it now. Whoever really did kill Mr. Hammer, also signed the Steel Samurai's death warrant. Maya: No... no! Penny: Also, I hear that Global Studios is going to change its programming. They're not going to make kids' shows anymore. Maya: W-what!? Why!? Penny: I don't know. It's sad, but that's what Global Studios decided. Studio policy (appears after \"The last episode\") Phoenix: Why aren't they going to make kids' shows anymore? Penny: The studio bigwigs don't want the Steel Samurai around anymore. They want to forget all this ever happened. They want it quiet, you understand? Maya: H-how can they just do that! What about all the kids who love the Steel Samurai! Penny: It's okay. I'm sure the kids will be fine. They'll find a new hero to follow. Maya: No, that can't be true! If the program just ends, they'll be heartbroken for sure! N-Nick! Say something! Phoenix: Umm... yeah. (I think evidence, rather than words, is called for here.) Here, take a look at this. Present \"Path to Glory\" Phoenix: Leads to: \"And this is...?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Penny: What's this? Phoenix: This is why you can't stop the Steel Samurai. Penny: I'm sorry... I don't understand. Maya: Neither do I, Nick. Phoenix: F-funny that. I don't either! (Oops. Let's try that again.) Leads back to: \"I think evidence, rather than words, is called for here.\" Penny: And this is...? Phoenix: A fan collected all of these photographs. The kids love the Steel Samurai! The show shouldn't be cancelled just so some adults can save face! I would think you would understand that better than anyone. Penny: ... ... You're right... Okay! But what can I do? Phoenix: Well, for starters... You can tell me something. Tell me what it is that Global Studios is so intent on hiding? Tell me about this accident five years ago. Penny: ... Okay! Five years ago (appears after \"Mr. Hammer\", before clearing \"Studio policy\" Talk option) Phoenix: An accident five years ago? Penny: Yes, in Studio Two. That trailer there was part of the film set. Phoenix: Could you tell us what happened? Penny: ... S-sorry. I don't think I can. They really don't want us to talk about it. Five years ago (after clearing \"Studio policy\" Talk option) Phoenix: Could you tell us what happened five years ago? Penny: Well, I can tell you what I've heard. Apparently, five years ago, someone died... and it was Hammer's fault. Maya: S-someone died!? Penny: It was an accident, of course! Anyway... The producer, Ms. Vasquez managed to hush it up. Phoenix: And that's the \"dirt\" she had on Mr. Hammer? Maya: And that's why Mr. Hammer would do anything Ms. Vasquez asked him to do! ... But, it was an accident, right? Why didn't they just make it public? Penny: Well, you know Mr. Hammer was a big star back then. They were afraid about what would happen to his career if word got out. Maya: I see... Penny: You know who knows more about this? Ms. Oldbag. She was here at the studios back then, you know. Phoenix: Thanks. We'll try asking her. (If she'll talk...) Present Powers's(?) Photo Penny: So this photo was Mr. Hammer all along? Phoenix: It seems that way. Penny: Why would Mr. Hammer do something like that? \"Path to Glory\" Penny: Wow... wow! It must have taken him forever to collect all these. Maya: Kids love the Steel Samurai. Penny: They do, don't they? Sleeping Pill Bottle Penny: What's that? Phoenix: An empty bottle of sleeping pills. With Mr. Hammer's fingerprints on it... Penny: ... Now I'm really confused! Anything else Penny: I'm sorry... I'm not sure what to make of that. Studio - Main Gate (after clearing \"Five years ago\" Talk option upon clearing \"Studio policy\" Talk option in Global Studios - Dressing Room) Oldbag: What, you're still slinking around? If you like the place so much, why don't you take over for me? Maya: The old windbag doesn't look so good... Oldbag: E-everybody's doing their darnedest to forget Hammer. Who do they think made Global Studios what it is today? Hammer! It's all due to Hammer! Maya: She's starting to froth at the mouth, Nick... Maybe we should keep a safe distance? Talk Five years ago Phoenix: Umm... I wanted to ask you about five years ago... Oldbag: ! Who told!? Who did you hear that from!? Phoenix: I, uh... huh? Oldbag: Nichols! Phoenix: N-nickels? Maya: Nichols, Nick. Penny Nichols. That assistant we talked to. Phoenix: O-oh, right. Anyway, we heard about the accident. It was during filming with Jack Hammer... He killed a man. Didn't he? Oldbag: Wh-whippersnappers! Dredging up dirt on someone's past like that... and the recently departed, no less! I suppose you think this is fun!? Phoenix: N-no, I'm just doing my job to protect Mr. Powers... Oldbag: And you claim that Hammer stole Powers's costume! You expect me to believe that rubbish!? Or do you have some kind of proof? Phoenix: (Proof that Hammer stole Powers's costume? Hmm...) I have proof Phoenix: I'm sorry Ms. Oldbag, but I do have proof. I can prove that Mr. Hammer stole Mr. Powers's costume. Present Steak Plate Phoenix: Phoenix: Mr. Powers ate a t-bone steak for lunch, correct? Oldbag: W-well... yes. So? Phoenix: This is the plate that he used to eat that steak. There are traces of sleeping pill powder on the plate! Oldbag: Mmmph? Hah! I-I bet Powers put it in there himself! Even a lightweight like him must have trouble sleeping sometimes. Phoenix: Except, I have proof that Mr. Hammer put the pills in. Present Sleeping Pill Bottle Phoenix: Phoenix: This bottle contained sleeping pills. Mr. Hammer's fingerprints were found on the bottle. Leads to: \"...!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Oldbag: Hmph! What's that supposed to prove!? That means nothing to me! Maya: Nick... I'm kinda having trouble figuring that one out too. Phoenix: (Hmm... wrong evidence? But I know Oldbag knows something! I have to get her to talk!) Leads back to Talk options Present Sleeping Pill Bottle Phoenix: Phoenix: Here's my proof. Oldbag: What? What's a little empty bottle supposed to prove? Phoenix: It's a bottle of sleeping pills. With Mr. Hammer's fingerprints on it... Oldbag: Wh-what does that prove? I... I'm sure old Hammer had some sleepless nights! Where's your proof that he used those pills on Powers? Present Steak Plate Phoenix: Phoenix: Mr. Powers ate a t-bone steak for lunch, correct? Oldbag: W-well... yes. So? Phoenix: This is the plate that he used to eat that steak.

I see how you work! Anything that doesn't fit, you just blame on the dead! Well... well... Just butt out, lawyer-boy! Phoenix: (She knows something! But how am I going to get her to talk...?) Leads back to Talk options Present Anything Oldbag: Sorry... I don't want to think about it anymore. Oldbag: ...! ... ... I see. Poor, poor Hammer. You did wrong, Hammer, rest your soul. Maya: Ms. Oldbag...? Oldbag: Okay. You win. I'll talk. I'm tired, see... Tired of holding it all in. Phoenix: Ms. Oldbag... Oldbag: You're right. Five years ago there was an accident... a fatal accident. What's worse, a paparazzi took a photo of it. That photo, well, it caused quite a stir. And guess who made it all better? Vasquez! She has ties to the mafia... She silenced that paparazzi. That was the beginning. After that, she became a force to be reckoned with here at the studio. Maya: I see...! Oldbag: But, you have to understand... Poor old Hammer never meant any harm to anyone! Maya: Ms. Oldbag... Oldbag: Hold on a minute. Maya: Poor Ms. Oldbag... Oldbag: Here, take this. Phoenix: ...? A photograph? W-wait a second! Oldbag: This is the picture. Phoenix: Is... this the trailer in Studio Two? Oldbag: Hammer was supposed to fight with a bad guy on the top of those stairs, there. He pushed the other actor, and the man fell onto the flowerbox fence. Phoenix: B-but how did you get this? Oldbag: It... was a long time ago. I don't feel much like talking about it. Phoenix: I understand... Five-Year-Old Photo added to the Court Record. Talk Five years ago Oldbag: You're right. Five years ago there was an accident... a fatal accident. What's worse, a paparazzi took a photo of it. That photo, well, it caused quite a stir. And guess who made it all better? Vasquez! She has ties to the mafia... She silenced that paparazzi. That was the beginning. After that, she became a force to be reckoned with here at the studio. Maya: I see...! Oldbag: But, you have to understand... Poor old Hammer never meant any harm to anyone! Maya: Ms. Oldbag... Present Five-Year-Old Photo Oldbag: Poor old Hammer. He was a big star. The biggest. That accident five years ago is what did him in. He wanted to hide it. He didn't want anyone to know. Poor, silly old Hammer. If he had just come out and confessed... Then Vasquez wouldn't have gotten her claws into him! Employee Area Maya: Detective Gumshoe must have left by now. Phoenix: He's probably thinking about what to do in tomorrow's trial. Maya: I bet Edgeworth is pretty angry with him. Move Dressing Room Leads to: \"The assistant must have gone off somewhere.\" Dressing Room Maya: The assistant must have gone off somewhere. That stuff about Mr. Hammer must have come as a shock to her. Outside Studio Two Present Five-Year-Old Photo Leads to: \"...\" Vasquez: ... Phoenix: (She's not even looking.) Vasquez: Where. Phoenix: Wh-what? Vasquez: Where did you get that? Phoenix: I, well... Vasquez: Oldbag. Phoenix: O-Old...? Maya: She means the security lady, Ms. Oldbag, Nick. Phoenix: Right... anyway... Ms. Vasquez. You hid this incident from the press, didn't you? And you used it to control Mr. Hammer! Vasquez: ... The wind. Phoenix: The... huh? Vasquez: It's gotten stronger, don't you think? The wind. ... Your conversation interests me. Let's talk about it more inside the trailer. Maya: Nick. She went inside the trailer. Trailer Vasquez: Hmph. You came. Well then, what was that you were talking about? Phoenix: (...! Why is she so eager to talk all of a sudden?) Ms. Vasquez. You were using that accident! You were blackmailing Mr. Hammer so you could control him, weren't you? That's why he was doing kids' shows for petty change! Vasquez: Hmph... So I'm a blackmailer now? Maya: Well, that's what it was, wasn't it! I mean, sure, it was an accident... But you used it to drag Mr. Hammer down from his rightful place as a star! Vasquez: Oh...? I haven't pulled anyone down from anywhere. Mr. Hammer's career went sour of its own accord. Maya: B-but! You were the cause! You pressured him... And to think it was just an accident...! Vasquez: Excuse me! What is this all about? You keep saying \"accident,\" \"accident\"... How are you so sure? Phoenix: What do you mean? Vasquez: Must I spell everything out for you? Think: what would it be if it wasn't an accident? Phoenix: ...! No... No way! You mean Mr. Hammer did it... on purpose? Vasquez: That is what I mean. Phoenix: Wh-where's your proof! Can you prove it!? Vasquez: Hmph! Just think! Would he have let me run his life for five years... over a mere accident? And I ran him hard, believe you me! Maya: B-but, the security lady said it was an accident! Vasquez: Oh. Well, she was a big fan of Hammer's, you see. She jumped on the reporter who brought that photo into the studio. She wrenched it out of his hands, she did. Gave him a few bruises, too. Phoenix: (... So that's why she had the photo...) Vasquez: She's an old fool. Of course, all the reporter would need is the negatives. He could have made a copy. But he didn't. The only copy of that photo is the one you hold. Give it to me. Now. Maya: W-what? This is valuable evidence! Vasquez: Boys! Phoenix: ... U-umm... Who are they...? Vasquez: Professionals. They're good at erasing... various things. What do you think...? Would you like to be erased? Phoenix: Wh-what!? Vasquez: The trial ends tomorrow? How unfortunate. It's a shame you'll have to miss it! Phoenix: ... Tell me why. Why do you want this photograph so badly? This is Mr. Hammer's \"dirt\"... no? Why should Dee Vasquez care about it at all? Vasquez: ... I'm sure you'll have plenty of time to think about that where you're going. So long, friends. Boys, erase away. Maya: Nooooooooooooo! Gumshoe: Hold it right there! I heard everything, pal! Dee Vasquez! You're coming down to the precinct with me, now! Vasquez: ... Hmph. Not bad. ... Very well. It appears this contest will be decided tomorrow then. In court. I'll be looking forward to it. Gumshoe: H-hey, you okay, pal? Sorry I was a little late with my entrance. I don't get many chances to practice that sorta thing. Maya: Detective Gumshoe... Thank you thank you thank you! I was really scared... Gumshoe: Huh? Don't mention it, pal. Just doing my job. ... ... Maya: Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Sorry, it's just... I've wanted to say that line ever since I became a detective. ... Okay. I've got one more job to do today. I'm sure we'll run into each other again soon! Maya: Well, Nick. It looks like we're getting close to the bottom of this. Phoenix: (And who's at the bottom...? Dee Vasquez!) To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here.\nTurnabout Samurai TranscriptPart 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 Part 5 Part 6October 20, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge: Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.Edgeworth: The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Phoenix: The defense is ready, Your Honor.Judge: Today will be the final day of this trial. I hope both the prosecution and the defense will be able to present decisive evidence. Very well, Mr. Edgeworth. Your opening statement.Edgeworth: In yesterday's session, the defense presented us with a new theory for this case. He claims that the scene of the crime was, in fact, Studio Two. Today, I will call on people present in the Studio Two trailer that day. From their testimonies, the truth will become clear.Judge: Hmm... very well!Phoenix: (Edgeworth seems a bit on edge today...)Judge: You may call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth.Edgeworth: The prosecution calls Ms. Dee Vasquez to the stand.

I am a producer for Global Studios.Edgeworth: On the day of the murder, you were in the trailer in Studio Two...Vasquez: As everyone here knows, yes?Edgeworth: ...?Vasquez: I dislike needless banter.

Make her pay!Phoenix: R-right! (If she's guilty, I'll catch her with her pants down... So to speak.)Witness Testimony-- The Day of the Murder --Vasquez: I entered the trailer, oh, a little before noon. The meeting began at 12:00 sharp. It ended at 4:00. There was to be a rehearsal afterwards, so we went to Studio One... I was fatigued, so I had Sal take me. At 2:30, we took a 15-minute break in the meeting. Sal and I ate t-bone steaks on the table in front of the trailer. We found Hammer's body later, when we all went to Studio One. That's all.Judge: Hmm... I have a question about one part of your testimony. You were \"fatigued\" so you had Sal \"take\" you...?Vasquez: The van.Judge: Hmm?Vasquez: There's a van at Studio Two. I had him take me in that. I thought it might be risky to walk, what with that monkey's head toppling over.Van added to the Court Record.Judge: I... I see! Very well.

Let's do it!Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Day of the Murder --Vasquez: I entered the trailer, oh, a little before noon.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: By yourself? Vasquez: Yes.

It ended at 4:00..Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Did no one leave during the meeting? Vasquez: No one. ... Phoenix: ... C-come on... let's talk a bit more about that. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The witness did not come here to engage in idle conversation! Stop interrupting the testimony. Vasquez: The same could be said to you, Mr. Edgeworth. And please stop banging on your little desk. It hurts my ears. Edgeworth: Mmph!Vasquez: There was to be a rehearsal afterwards, so we went to Studio One.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And when exactly was that? Vasquez: I've forgotten. Phoenix: ... Vasquez: ... Phoenix: Maybe you could try remembering? Vasquez: No. Edgeworth: The meeting ended at 4:00, and the rehearsal was scheduled for 5:00... I would think it was between those times. Phoenix: (You \"would think\"!? C'mon, all you did was state the obvious, Edgeworth!)Vasquez: I was fatigued, so I had Sal take me.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Hold on! You had Sal \"take\" you? What does that mean!? Vasquez: It means what I just said. I had Sal take me in the Studio Two van. Phoenix: (Oh... oh, right.)Vasquez: At 2:30, we took a 15-minute break in the meeting.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And what were you doing during that time...? Vasquez: Don't hit your desk. It irritates me. Edgeworth: Yeah! Mr. Wright...! Oops. Vasquez: ... It was a 15 minute break...Vasquez: Sal and I ate t-bone steaks on the table in front of the trailer.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Do you have someone who can verify this? Vasquez: Sal. Phoenix: N-no... I mean someone else? Vasquez: One person is enough. Phoenix: (If she committed murder during that break... She wouldn't have had time to eat a t-bone steak! If I had some evidence that proved she didn't eat that steak...)Present Steak Plate Phoenix: Leads to: \"Hah! As I thought!\"Maya: Well, Nick?

    "cot": "Okay, let's tackle this. So, the user provided a lot of information from the game, including characters, evidence, and testimonies. The task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other.\n\nLooking at the testimonies given by Dee Vasquez. The key points are:\n\nTestimony 5: \"Sal and I ate t-bone steaks on the table in front of the trailer.\" This is from Vasquez claiming they ate during the 15-minute break.\n\nNow, looking at the evidence. Evidence 16 is the Steak Plate, which was found in the employee area and has traces of sleeping pills. But wait, Vasquez said they ate in front of the trailer, which is in Studio Two. The Steak Plate was found in the Employee Area, not Studio Two. That's a contradiction because if they ate in Studio Two, the plate shouldn't be in the Employee Area. Also, the plate has sleeping pills, which were used on Will Powers. But according to Vasquez's testimony, they ate their steaks during the break, implying they had their own plates. However, the presence of the plate in the Employee Area suggests that the meal was actually consumed there, not at Studio Two. Therefore, Vasquez's testimony about where they ate contradicts the location of the found plate."

Maya: It makes it a lot easier to go up hills! Phoenix: Don't people cycle to get exercise!? Drain grate Phoenix: The metal grate on the drain here has been taken off. That's a pretty big drain. A kid could fit through there, I bet. Maya: Yeah, if you snuck in that way you wouldn't have to pay at the gate! Phoenix: Well, if you want to leave that way, be my guest. Maya: Right! Huh? Hey! I'm not a kid! Grate Phoenix: The grate that used to cover the drain. It's a little bent. I don't think it would fit if I tried to put it back on. Lunch table Phoenix: The remains of yesterday's lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak. Maya: Mmm! T-bone steak! That would have hit the spot. Phoenix: You just had a burger! Maya: Yeah, but I have a second stomach just for steaks. Phoenix: (What!?)

Cardkey added to the Court Record. Bag (subsequent times) Maya: I wonder what else is inside Powers's bag...? Phoenix: Stop that! (My partner, the thief in training.) Table Phoenix: There's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Some tea and cookies... Maya: Nick... I'm hungry! Phoenix: You just had a burger! Maya: Yeah, but I have a separate stomach for sweets! Phoenix: (How many stomachs does this girl have!?) Window Phoenix: It's locked. Looks like he doesn't open his window much. I guess it is kind of dusty outside. Wright & Co. Law Offices Present Cardkey Maya: Oh, hey! That's the cardkey to get into Studio One where the murder took place! Let's go check it out! Studio - Main Gate Present Cardkey Phoenix: Could you tell me about this, ma'am? Oldbag: Oh that! Isn't that a studio cardkey? You better watch it! The scene of a murder is no place for sightseeing! I'll be taking that! Hand it over! Phoenix: W-wait! No, that's mine! Oldbag: Look, I don't have a cardkey to the studio, see? I want to go pay my respects to Jack Hammer where he died. Phoenix: W... well you'll just have to wait! Outside Studio One Examine Studio One entrance Phoenix: The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body. Maya: Let's go in and check it out, Nick! Phoenix: I wonder if this cardkey we borrowed from the dressing room will work... *beep* Phoenix: It opened! Maya: Alright! We're in! Phoenix: (She's way too happy for someone visiting a crime scene.) Present Cardkey Maya: Hey, Detective! Take a look at this! Gumshoe: Whazzat? Phoenix: Whoa whoa whoa! Don't show him that! He'll confiscate it! Maya: Aww... I just wanted to show it off. After examining Studio One entrance in Studio One Entrance: October 16Studio One Maya: ... Phoenix: What is it? Maya: ... Phoenix: You're real quiet all of a sudden. Maya: Doesn't it give you the shivers, Nick? That white tape! It's so... so real! Phoenix: Well, the Evil Magistrate did die here. And the Steel Samurai killed him. The murder weapon was the Samurai Spear. Sounds pretty real to me... Examine Director's chair Maya: Hey! Look! That's the chair the director sits in! I've always wanted to sit in one of these. Hey Nick, take a look at that. One of those black-and-white boards they clap at the start of filming! And look! A megaphone! A real live megaphone! Phoenix: ... Maya: Ready, Nick? Action! Phoenix: (This girl is more troubled than I thought...) Film camera Leads to: \"Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton!\" Reflecting screen Maya: What's this? Phoenix: That's for reflecting light. They call it a reflecting screen or something like that. The assistant holds it during filming. Maya: Huh. Phoenix: What? Where's your enthusiasm for all things entertainment? Maya: Well, lighting is fine, but I'd want to be the director. Or maybe the Steel Samurai! Phoenix: (I think she's being serious...!) Stage backdrop Phoenix: Looks like a backdrop for a stage. This must be used in the Steel Samurai show. Maya: Of course! That's the mountain, Neo Fujiyama! Phoenix: Doesn't the Steel Samurai take place in Olde Tokyo? Can you even see Mt. Fuji from there? Maya: Not Olde Tokyo, Nick! \"Neo\" Olde Tokyo! Phoenix: Oh. Right. (Step)ladder Maya: Look, a ladder! Phoenix: That's a \"step\"-ladder. Maya: So? What's the difference? You need to stop judging things based on narrow-minded cultural assumptions, Nick! Phoenix: R-right... sorry. (This girl is OUT there!) Tape outline Phoenix: They outlined where Jack Hammer's body lay with tape. His body was found still inside the Evil Magistrate costume. I guess that's why the head part looks like a helmet. Funny, I expected a spear stabbing would leave at least a few bloodstains. I guess the costume must have absorbed most of it... Maya: Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton! Phoenix: Yeah! So don't touch it! Maya: Whoa! It's heavier than I thought... ???: Hey! You! No touching that! Phoenix: Ah, um, sorry, my partner is kind of, y'know... Maya: \"Y'know\"!? No I don't know! Phoenix: Umm... who are you? Penny: Who me? I'm an assistant here. I help with props and stuff. Moving them around, ordering new ones, et cetera. Maya: We're lawyers representing Mr. Will Powers. Penny: Oh, you're WP's people. Maya: \"WP\"...? Oh, Will Powers. W.P., I get it. Penny: I don't envy you guys one bit! But... do what you can for WP, okay? He'd never hurt a fly! He has to be innocent. Maya: Don't worry, leave it to us! Talk The day of the crime Phoenix: Could you tell me anything about the day of the murder? Penny: Yes. I was in the studio the whole day. I was the only assistant on staff that day, you see. Maya: Only one assistant!? Penny: Yes, well, the studios isn't doing so well right now. (Changed from [Yes, well, the studios aren't doing so well right now.] in the original release) And yesterday was only rehearsal for our action sequences. Maya: Oh, I see. (Changed from [I see. Neat!] in the original release) Penny: In the morning we went through the action sequences in the employee area. WP and Hammer were there, along with everyone else. Phoenix: The employee area--that's where Powers's dressing room is, right? Penny: Yes, that's the place. After eating lunch there, Mr. Hammer went to Studio One. Then I saw WP go into his dressing room. But I didn't see either of them after that. Will Powers Phoenix: Did you know that Mr. Powers was sleeping in his room? Penny: No! I wouldn't go in there unless I had some urgent message for him... I mean, it's his private... What kind of a girl do you think I am!? Phoenix: W-what kind...? No, no, I'm sure you're a fine girl. Um, sorry. (So much for getting a confirmation of Powers's alibi.) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, any thoughts about this? Penny: Sorry... I... don't really want to think too much about what happened just yet. After clearing all Talk options: Maya: What do we do, Nick? We haven't found anything. If WP was the only one who came to the studio... Then he has to be the killer! They even have a photograph... Phoenix: Hmm... Penny: Umm... Sorry... I know you're busy. Phoenix: Not really. Penny: Actually, there's been something bothering me. Maya: Ah hah! That's what I'm talking about! A clue! A lead! Penny: Well, I don't know about that, but that day, just after noon, I sensed someone was here... Phoenix: You \"sensed\"? Penny: Yes, several times. Phoenix: Some other studio employees, maybe? Penny: No, I don't think so. The only thing we had scheduled was an action scene run-through. I was the only assistant here that day. I have a feeling it was someone from... outside. Phoenix: R-really!? Maya: But wait, if someone had come in here... Wouldn't that security lady have noticed them? Phoenix: Yeah, you're right. Penny: I'm sorry I don't have any better information than that. Maya: No, thanks! That helps us a lot. Anything helps. Let's go put that security lady on the spot! Talk Sensing someone Phoenix: So you sensed that someone other than the regular film crew was in the studio? Penny: Yes... I think. Phoenix: (\"I think\" doesn't cut it in a witness testimony.) Maya: Nick! What about that security lady! If someone else came into the studio, she must have seen them! October 16Global StudiosMain Gate Oldbag: What? You're still here? Really! You look as though you've seen a ghost! Talk Assistant's claim Leads to: \"What? I saw that suspicious look on your face!\" Oldbag: What? I saw that suspicious look on your face! Phoenix: I wanted to ask you again about yesterday... You came here at 1:00 PM, correct? And the estimated time of Hammer's death was 2:30. Are you sure that Powers was the only one to go through here between those times? Oldbag: Sure as can be! Maya: But we have a witness who thinks there was \"someone from outside\" here that day. Oldbag: What!? Maya: Are you absolutely sure you were here watching the whole time? Oldbag: ... Maya: Ma'am? Oldbag: Who was it? Who told you that? Who dares question ME!? Maya: Eek! Oldbag: Alright you better tell me and tell me quick, you spiky-haired cretin! Someone's been complaining about the work I do, eh!? Maya: Uh... um, we were just talking to the assistant in Studio One. Oldbag: Her! She's not even a full-time employee! All you young'uns are like that nowadays, running your mouths like there was no tomorrow saying this that and the other thing. Well when I was young let me tell you we knew a thing or two about respecting our elders. Back then we did and it's a crying shame that you youths today just say what you please about poor old ladies Graaaaaaaaaaaawr! Phoenix: She left... Maya: Well, Nick? This is our chance to do what we can without her looking over our shoulders! Examine Computer Phoenix: The computer that runs the studio security cameras. Maya: Nick! Maybe we can see that photo of Powers with this computer! Phoenix: Yeah, maybe. (Should I try the computer?) Try it Phoenix: Okay. Let's give it a try. Maya: You know how to work these things, Nick? Phoenix: Looks like I just have to enter in a few numbers. Let's see... first, I need the date of the murder. (It looks like the camera turned on at 1:00 PM that day... 1:00... That was when the security lady arrived at the guard station.) [Please enter the number of the security camera.] ST1-703 Phoenix: There! Entered! Maya: ... ... Nothing happened. Phoenix: Huh? Maybe I got the number wrong. Maya: *sigh* Maybe we should go look at that camera again? Leads back to examination ST1-307 Leads to: \"There! Entered!\" ST1-370 Phoenix: There! Entered! Maya: ... ... Nothing happened. Phoenix: Huh? Maybe I got the number wrong. Maya: *sigh* Maybe we should go look at that camera again? Leads back to examination Leave it alone Phoenix: (Hmm... I'd better not fool around with this, or that security lady will get me. Maybe next time.) Maya: What? You're not going to look at it? Bo-ring! Leads back to examination Phoenix: There! Entered! ... Maya: Hey! It printed out the data for that day! Phoenix: Let's see what we got... ... Huh? Maya: How is this a picture of Will Powers? Phoenix: Well, he is the one who always wears that suit... I guess that's why the security lady thought it was him. Maya: I don't imagine the detective was very happy with this photo as evidence. Hmm? Something's printed on the back. Phoenix: Huh? [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2] Maya: What does that mean? Phoenix: Maybe there's more photo data from that day? Maya: Nope--that's the only one in the computer. Powers's{?} Photo added to the Court Record. Maya: Hey, hey, Nick! Can't we use this photo as evidence for the trial? Phoenix: Yeah. Maya: We'll put that security lady in her place with this! Phoenix: Right, we'll put her in her place... Maya: Hey, that's what I said! Anyway... Let's show her this photo and see what she says! Phoenix: Wait. Let's not. Maya: Why not? Phoenix: It's never a good idea to reveal your hand to the enemy too soon. Maya: Nick! You're craftier than I gave you credit for. Why, you could be the next... Evil Magistrate! Phoenix: Hey! Why do I have to be the villain. Maya: Relax, it was just a joke! So, are we done for today? Phoenix: I think this photo is what we needed for the trial. Still, it'd be better if we had some idea who the real killer was! Maybe it really is that security lady...? To be continued. Before selecting \"ST1-307\" upon examining computer in Global Studios - Main Gate: October 16Studio One Maya: No one's here. I wonder if the security lady got mad at that assistant? Phoenix: Hmm. That's definitely a possibility. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here. Turnabout Samurai Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 Part 5 Part 6 October 18, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4 Judge: The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers. Edgeworth: The prosecution is ready, Your Honor. Phoenix: The defense is ready, Your Honor. Judge: Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please. Edgeworth: The prosecution will show the court that at 2:30 PM on October 15, the defendant, Mr. Will Powers, killed fellow actor Jack Hammer at Studio One of Global Studios. It is impossible for anyone else to have committed this heinous crime. The evidence presented during the trial will all point to this fact. Judge: Hmm. I see. Very well, I would like to move on to your testimony. Mr. Edgeworth, the prosecution may call its first witness. Edgeworth: Very well, I call a most familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand. (Changed from [First, I would like to call a familiar face, Detective Gumshoe, to the stand.] in the original release) Edgeworth: Detective, if you would briefly describe this case to the court? Gumshoe: Yes sir! I'll explain with the guidemap here. To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see? This here is the Employee Area. The actors did a run-through of their action scenes during the morning here. This is the main gate to the studios. The security lady that works at the studios was here at 1:00 PM on that day. Past the security station there is a gate, see? Past that are the studios. And here it is... Studio One. This is the scene of the murder, where the body was found! Now, on the day of the murder, October 15, there were only three people here. The victim, Jack Hammer, the defendant, Will Powers, and a young woman, the production assistant. All the production staff were in the Employee Area until noon. Then after lunch, the victim, Jack Hammer, went to Studio One. Right after that, at 1:00 PM, the security lady got to the guard station. Now, jump ahead to later that day... 5:00 PM. The production staff came to Studio One to perform a rehearsal. Needless to say, the rehearsal was cancelled... The time of death was 2:30 PM. The \"Samurai Spear\" found lodged in the victim's chest was the murder weapon. That's the case, in brief. Anyone like to hear that again? Phoenix: (Hmm... should I listen to that whole thing again...?) Skip it Leads to: \"I think I can probably remember that...\" Listen again Phoenix: I'm sorry, could you describe that one more time? Gumshoe: I shoulda known it would be you, pal! Fine. Once more for the mentally-challenged lawyer. Phoenix: (Yeah, yeah. Live it up while you can, Gumshoe.) Leads back to: \"To understand this case, it's important to grasp the layout of the studios, see?\" Phoenix: (I think I can probably remember that...) Judge: So the murder weapon was a \"spear\"? How... medieval! Samurai Spear added to the Court Record. Edgeworth: Your Honor. This case is quite simple if you ask one question: And that question is: \"What did the security lady at the guard station see?\" Judge: Understood. Edgeworth: Let's call this security officer to the stand! Edgeworth: Will the witness declare her name? Oldbag: ... Hmm? My, aren't you a handsome fellow! I'm afraid I'm a bit flustered! Edgeworth: Y-your name, please! Oldbag: Oh, dearie! No need for you to be embarrassed! Just call me \"grandma.\" Edgeworth: YOUR NAME, PLEASE! Phoenix: (Seems Edgeworth has a bit of trouble getting his witnesses to say their names...) Oldbag: Wendy Oldbag, dearie. So just call me \"grandma.\" It's practically my name! So even when I was young I was an Oldbag, but not really that was just my name dearie. Still how the other children would make fun of me and just because of my name can you believe it? But there was this boy, the captain of the chess club in junior high, and when he called me an old bag well I just cried and cried because I had a crush on him you see-- Edgeworth: Edgeworth: O-objection! I... object to the witness's talkativeness. Judge: Objection sustained! The witness will refrain from rambling on the stand. Oldbag: I was just getting to the good part, dearie! Edgeworth: Perhaps we can get to the testimony? Judge: Now, the witness was stationed at the main gate on the day of the murder, correct? Oldbag: Yessey I was. Judge: And to get to the scene of the murder, someone would have to pass by you? Oldbag: You know your stuff, dearie! Judge: ... You may begin your testimony. Phoenix: (She sure is one hell of an Oldbag...) Witness Testimony -- Witness's Account -- Oldbag: On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM. Poor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning. I, well, I had some errands to run that morning. Anyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station. I was at the main gate from then until 5:00! Now, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right? Interesting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM. It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio! Judge: You saw the defendant, then? Hmm... Very well. Let's begin the cross-examination. Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. Cross Examination -- Witness's Account -- Oldbag: On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So up until that time, anyone who wanted to could go into the studio? Oldbag: Well, there wasn't a security guard at the gate, no. But the main gate was locked, dearie. You'd need an employee cardkey to get in. Phoenix: (Right... the cardkey that I have. So, what she's saying is no one who wasn't supposed to be there could get in.) Edgeworth: Was there anyone at the studios when you arrived at the guard station? Oldbag: Poor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: A \"run-through\"...? Oldbag: They were working out a scene between the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate. They got the basics figured out by noon, and were to use the afternoon for practice. Rehearsal was supposed to start at 5:00. That's why poor old Hammer went to Studio One in the afternoon. Phoenix: (So Powers was in his dressing room sleeping... when he was supposed to be practicing! Talk about a laid-back hero...) Edgeworth: If there was a run-through in the morning, why did you only get there after noon? Oldbag: I, well, I had some errands to run that morning. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What kind of \"errands\"? Oldbag: Oh, well, you know. Phoenix: Answer the question! Oldbag: Actually... I was watching poor Hammer and Powers. Observing, you know? Phoenix: O-observing? Weren't you supposed to be at the guard station? Oldbag: Whippersnapper! I told you I locked the gate, didn't I? I did my job! Phoenix: (I'm not sure your boss would see it that way...) Oldbag: Anyway! I always watch Hammer's run-throughts. Always! Never missed one in all my years. Maya: Wow! I want to see a Steel Samurai run-through too! Phoenix: You could quit being a spirit medium and take up guard duty. Maya: Not a bad idea... Oldbag: Anyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Did you see the victim then? Oldbag: Did I see poor old Hammer? Nope. He'd already gone to the studio before I got back to the guard station. Edgeworth: Tell us what happened next. Oldbag: I was at the main gate from then until 5:00! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you were watching there the WHOLE time? No breaks? Not even a second? Oldbag: O-of course! I am a professional, you know! Our are you criticizing how I do my job!? Whippersnapper! Phoenix: No, it's just, after seeing you eating those donuts in the guard station yesterday... Oldbag: I can watch the gate and eat donuts at the same time! Snipperwhapper! Maya: \"Snipperwhapper\"...? Old windbag is losing it, Nick. Phoenix: Why don't you raise an objection? Judge: So, the witness was on duty through the afternoon, the whole time. Very well. What did you see? Oldbag: Now, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right? Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How did you know that? Oldbag: Oh hoh hoh. I have my ways! That over-dressed young detective told me. I fed him some donuts and he talked and talked... If you ask me, that detective isn't cut out for his job. Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: (Poor Detective Gumshoe, getting chewed out by a security guard...) Oldbag: Interesting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: 2:00? You're sure? Oldbag: Sure as spit! Judge: Well, who was the man!? Oldbag: Really, you should try not to get so excited at your age. You might strain something. Judge: ... Oldbag: Now, now, don't get your skivvies all in a bunch. I'll tell you who it was! Present Powers's(?) Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag!\" Oldbag: It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you saw Mr. Powers? Oldbag: That's what I said! Got wax in your ears, sonny? Maya: Nick, this is your chance! Phoenix: Yeah, time to pull out the secret weapon... Oldbag: I'll say it again! It was him! Present Powers's(?) Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag!\" Maya: Nick... Doesn't she seem like she's enjoying this a little too much? Phoenix: Windbags love gossiping about other people's misfortunes. Maya: Ugh. Can't she get her kicks somewhere else? Phoenix: Let me get this straight, old bag! Er, Ms. Oldbag! You've been saying since yesterday that you \"saw Mr. Powers,\" correct? But you're talking about the man in this photo, aren't you! Judge: J-just a moment, Mr. Wright. Let me see that photo! ... What is this, exactly? Phoenix: None other than the Steel Samurai, defender of Neo Olde Tokyo. Ms. Oldbag! Is this the \"Mr. Powers\" that you saw!? Oldbag: Of course! Didn't your momma teach you any sense, sonny? Anyone can plainly see that's Powers! Right? Edgeworth: No, they can't! (Changed from [Um, yeah.] in the original release) ... Umm... well. I mean, I wonder? (Changed from [Umm... well. I wonder?] in the original release) Phoenix: True, Mr. Powers does play the role of the Steel Samurai! But that doesn't mean Mr. Powers IS the Steel Samurai! Oldbag: ...! I... I know that! I wasn't born yesterday! Judge: No one in this court is accusing you of that, Ms... er, witness. Phoenix: (He's having trouble calling her \"Oldbag\" apparently...) Judge: However, you do not have proof that the person in this photo is Mr. Will Powers, do you? Oldbag: Humph! Nosy old man! Of course I have proof! Phoenix: What!? Edgeworth: Huh!? Phoenix: (Even Edgeworth is surprised!?) Edgeworth: The prosecution would like to ask the old... the witness. Please make known all the information in your possession ahead of time! Oldbag: How was I to know everyone would be so nosy! You should be ashamed, all of you! Anyway, I showed that photo to the young detective. He told me \"this isn't any good as evidence, pal.\" He didn't even give it a second look! Edgeworth: ... Phoenix: (Wow, old windbag has left even Edgeworth speechless. She's good!) Judge: Let's hear about your proof, then. Witness Testimony -- The Man in the Photo -- Oldbag: I never say anything I don't mean, mind you! That morning, during the run-through of the action scene... I saw Powers trip and fall! He broke one of the props, it was a big mess. Apparently, he sprained his ankle pretty bad. Now, look at that picture! You can see he's dragging his leg! See? Clear as day! That's how I knew it was Powers. Happy? Judge: Hmm. So he had sprained his ankle...? Very well. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness. Phoenix: (She's got to be hiding something... I'll press her until she squeals.) Cross Examination -- The Man in the Photo -- Oldbag: I never say anything I don't mean, mind you! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Umm... Oldbag: Whippersnapper! Phoenix: (Hey, I haven't said anything yet!) Oldbag: I'll have you know I'm not pointing fingers at anyone behind their backs! Everything I've said is on the straight and narrow! The up and up! Youth today! Always whining about each other, pointing fingers this way and that! It's enough to make an old lady want to cry... Edgeworth: Mr. Wright! Please, for all our sakes, try not to upset the witness! Phoenix: (I think Edgeworth has met his match...) Oldbag: That morning, during the run-through of the action scene... Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Who was present at the run-through? Oldbag: Well, let's see... There was Powers, he's the Steel Samurai... Then poor old Hammer, the Evil Magistrate. And... me. Judge: And what exactly were you doing? Oldbag: Observing! Just... observing. Phoenix: What about the assistant? Oldbag: Oh, she was off moving backdrops around and such. Phoenix: (So she didn't see the run-through, then...) Oldbag: I saw Powers trip and fall! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Trip and fall\"...? Oldbag: Yes! And to think, he's supposed to be the Steel Samurai! What a laugh! So Powers sprained his ankle. I helped make it better for him, of course. Judge: You... helped make it better? Oldbag: I kissed it where it hurt. Judge: L-let's just skip over that part, shall we? Phoenix: Where was the assistant then? Oldbag: Oh, her? She was cleaning up backdrops, I think. She didn't know about Powers's ankle. Phoenix: (Hmm...) Edgeworth: You may continue your testimony. Oldbag: He broke one of the props, it was a big mess. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: He broke a prop? Oldbag: Sure did! His own Samurai Spear. Phoenix: (His Samurai Spear... the murder weapon!?) Oldbag: Luckily I was there with my duct tape to fix it. Phoenix: (This strikes me as a significant detail... I'd better write this down in the Court Record.) Samurai Spear updated in the Court Record. Press (subsequent times) Phoenix: Phoenix: He broke a prop? Oldbag: Sure did! His own Samurai Spear. Phoenix: (His Samurai Spear... the murder weapon!?) Oldbag: Luckily I was there with my duct tape to fix it. Phoenix: (This strikes me as a significant detail...) Oldbag: Apparently, he sprained his ankle pretty bad. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Was Mr. Power's [sic] ankle badly sprained? Oldbag: Not so bad that he couldn't walk around. He went to his dressing room to rest up after lunch. Phoenix: (Thus the nap...) Oldbag: Anyway, I saw him dragging his foot when he walked. Phoenix: (Dragging his foot... okay.) Oldbag: You can see he's dragging his leg! See? Clear as day! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you absolutely sure? (Let's take a look at that picture again... Hmm... so he was walking strangely because he was injured...) Judge: Hmm. It does look like he was dragging his foot. Oldbag: See! And you didn't trust me! Whippersnapper! Oldbag: That's how I knew it was Powers. Happy? Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Still, you can't look at this and say it's Mr. Powers! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Yes, but only Mr. Powers would have been dragging his leg! Judge: He has a point. It does seem quite likely that it was Powers. Phoenix: (There's got to be more to this. I'd better keep pressing her.) Maya: Well, Nick? Find any glaring contradictions? Phoenix: Well, she seems pretty sure that was Powers in that photo... I guess I'll just press her and see if I can shake her conviction... After pressing second or third statement, then pressing fourth statement: Edgeworth: I think we've heard enough! Haven't we, Your Honor? Judge: Well, there is one thing that bothers me. Edgeworth: Which is? Judge: Where is this \"Steel Samurai\" costume now? Edgeworth: Umm... hmm. Actually, well... We couldn't find it. We're looking, though. Judge: Hmm... Edgeworth: Anyway, that's not important! The witness did see the Steel Samurai, yes. And it is clear that the person in the Steel Samurai suit was Mr. Will Powers! Judge: Hmm... I suppose that's right. Phoenix: (Are you sure you're sure, Your Honor?) Object Phoenix: Hold it right there! We keep talking possibilities, but we have to agree that this photo shows the Steel Samurai! Nowhere in this photo can we see Mr. Will Powers! Judge: Hmm... The defense has a point. I also wonder if someone else not caught on camera could have killed Mr. Hammer. We have to consider that possibility, also. Edgeworth: Then allow me to remove that doubt from your mind, Your Honor... Leads to: \"Will the witness continue her testimony, please?\" Wait and see what happens Phoenix: (I think I'll wait and see where this goes.) Judge: I suppose, since there weren't any additional crew members at the studios that day... It's quite likely that it was the defendant inside that costume. I see no problem with this evidence. Edgeworth: Most perceptive, Your Honor! Phoenix: (He still doesn't seem that convinced to me... I hope.) Leads to: \"Will the witness continue her testimony, please?\" Edgeworth: Will the witness continue her testimony, please? Oldbag: No need to ask twice! Witness Testimony -- Witness's Account, cont. -- Oldbag: The time of poor Hammer's death was 2:30 PM, true? The only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers! No one else went there! If they had, I would have seen them! Judge: Hmm... So, if no one else went to the studio... Then it would have to be this \"Steel Samurai\" who did it. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness. Cross Examination -- Witness's Account, cont. -- Oldbag: The time of poor Hammer's death was 2:30 PM, true? Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How do you know that? Oldbag: Eh? Didn't I just explain? I gave donuts to the young detective. And the, after some rubbish about it being a \"secret, pal\" he told me everything. Phoenix: (I see Detective Gumshoe shares his fellow officer's fondness for donuts.) Oldbag: The only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you absolutely sure!? Oldbag: Oh, quite, quite, sonny. Nobody suspicious lookin' passed by at all. Phoenix: (Nobody suspicious lookin'... Right.) Present Powers's(?) Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"Hold on!\" Oldbag: No one else went there! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What about before you got to the guard station? Oldbag: You mean before 1:00? Why, everyone was in the Employee Area before then. And I locked the main gate so no one could get in. Not to mention... Present Powers's(?) Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"Hold on!\" Oldbag: If they had, I would have seen them! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you sure!? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The witness has answered the question! Anyone going into the studio had to pass by the witness! Oldbag: That's right, sonny! You let 'em have it, Edgey-boy! Phoenix: (E-Edgey-boy...?) Edgeworth: ... Present Powers's(?) Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"Hold on!\" Maya: Old windbag sure has balls! Or... well, you know what I mean. Phoenix: Old windbags have a way of skipping over important details, after all... Or, for that matter, entirely forgetting them. Maya: How convenient. Phoenix: (Something for you to look forward to, perhaps?) Phoenix: Hold on! Look at this photograph one more time. This photo was taken by the camera at the gate for the studios, correct? Oldbag: Yesiree, sonny. Phoenix: So, whenever anyone passes by here, it automatically takes a picture? Oldbag: And here I thought you didn't know your head from a hole in the ground. Phoenix: Right... Anyway! It's also true that the computer in the guard station records all security cam data. Oldbag: Ooh! You know, if you wanted to work at the studio, we might have an opening. Phoenix: That very computer printed out this photo. Note that on the back of the photo are printed the words: [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2] Oldbag: Even I know that means it was taken at 2:00 PM on October the 15th! Really, sonny! Phoenix: Actually, I knew that too. The issure here is the bit at the end where it says: \"Photo #2\"... Oldbag: \"Photo #2\"...? Phoenix: The computer only held data for one photo on that day. Don't you think that's odd? Shouldn't this photo be \"Photo #1\" if it really was the ONLY photo!? Judge: Order! Order! Please tell the court what you mean by this, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Actually, that's what I want to ask the witness. This evidence shows that not one, but two people went to the studio that day. Yet there is only data for one of the photos! Who could have erased the data for the other photo? Only someone with access-- the security lady herself! (Changed from [Only someone with access... the security lady herself!] in the original release) Oldbag: Eh!? You watch your mouth, whippersnapper! The only person I saw that day was Will Powers! Phoenix: But the camera on the gate fired twice! That means two people went by! Oldbag: Umm... well, yes... that's what it would seem to mean... Judge: Can the witness explain this to the court? Oldbag: Umm... ahem. I-I don't understand these new-fangled computer things... Umm... E-Edgey-boy! Help! Edgeworth: Huh!? B-believe me, I want to, but I don't know what this means either. Oldbag: Humph! Some help you are! You're a whippersnapper too! ... ... Whippersnapper...? Judge: Something the matter, Ms. Oldbag? Oldbag: Ah! That's right! I... I just remembered something! Judge: Let me guess... Someone else passed by the gate... someone other than the Steel Samurai? Oldbag: Er... well, yes, I suppose you could put it that way. Judge: *sigh* I see. Your testimony, please. Witness Testimony -- The Other Person -- Oldbag: Every day, after I finish my guard duties, I have one other important job to do. I go through the photos recorded on the security computer and check them. I throw out any photos that aren't suspicious lookin', you see. Come to think of it, now I remember throwing out one photo that day! Edgeworth: M-Ms. Oldbag! This is the first I've heard of this! Oldbag: Well, of course, sonny! I've only just remembered it. Judge: Right... anyway, Mr. Wright, please begin the cross-examination. Maya: Well, I'd say this was a turn for the unexpected, but I kind of expected this... Cross Examination -- The Other Person -- Oldbag: Every day, after I finish my guard duties, I have one other important job to do. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Another \"job\"? Oldbag: T-that's right. I check all the people that passed by the main gate that day. I look closely at every one of the photos that security camera takes. Edgeworth: Do you backup all of the security camera data? Oldbag: Well, they keep telling me too, yes. But those computers are just so frustrating. Oldbag: I go through the photos recorded on the security computer and check them. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How many photos are there, usually? Oldbag: On a day when we're open to the public, we get more than 500 people. But on filming days or rehearsal days... well, we don't have much money. We never get more than 50, and that's a big day. Edgeworth: Do you backup all of the security camera data? Oldbag: Well, they keep telling me too, yes. But those computers are just so frustrating. Oldbag: I throw out any photos that aren't suspicious lookin', you see. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How exactly do you determine what isn't \"suspicious lookin'\"? Oldbag: Oh, you can tell by looking at their faces. For the most part. Phoenix: F-for the most part? This is a murder trial, Ms. Oldbag! Oldbag: Well, I didn't touch that suspicious lookin' Will Powers's photo, did I? Phoenix: (I think she's missing the point.) Oldbag: Come to think of it, now I remember throwing out one photo that day! Press Phoenix: Leads to: \"Well, who in the heck was in that photo you erased!?\" Maya: \"Come to think of it\"? Couldn't she think of that a little earlier!? Phoenix: Classic old windbag maneuver, Maya. Maya: Hmm... Might be a useful tactic to remember for use in my future career as a windbag. Phoenix: (Let's find out more about this \"erased\" photo.) Phoenix: Well, who in the heck was in that photo you erased!? Oldbag: Humph. A fanboy. Phoenix: F-fanboy? Oldbag: Steel Samurai fanboys. Real freaks, if you ask me. They get information about the rehearsals from gosh-knows-where. They're always hanging about. One was there that day. Phoenix: Phoenix: W-wait a second! Didn't you just say no one else could get in!? \"I locked the main gate so no one could get in\"... Those were your words! Oldbag: Well! If you must know, there's a drain that goes into the Employee Area. The grate has been loose for a while. It leads outside, and well, that's where they come in. Phoenix: They come in through the drain? Oldbag: I told you they were freaks. Oh, and... Phoenix: And...? Oldbag: They're kids. Children. Whippersnappers. Phoenix: K-kids!? So, on the photo that you erased...? Oldbag: It was a boy. Probably 2nd or 3rd grade. Phoenix: Whaaaaaaaaaaaat!? Judge: O-order! Order! Let me get this straight. You saw two people pass by the gate on their way to the studios that day? One was the Steel Samurai, dragging his leg. The other was a boy who looked to be in about 2nd or 3rd grade? Oldbag: Oh yes, well we see his type there every day. Can't stop 'em. Can't catch 'em. Edgeworth: A boy in 2nd or 3rd grade? Hmm... I assume it would be hard, if not impossible for a young boy to wield the Samurai Spear? Judge: Impossible, I'd think. It's quite heavy. Oldbag: Right! As I said, I didn't pay him much mind. That's why I erased the data. Maya: Um, Nick? What's going on? I mean, the boy was there, that makes him a suspect! Phoenix: Yeah, and they're already trying to \"un-suspect\" him. Judge: This court will take a five-minute recess. (Changed from [I'd like to take a five minute recess.] in the original release) I want the defense and the prosecution to consider this new information... And no forgetting vital information this time! October 18, 11:08 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3 Phoenix: Mr. WP? Will: Y-yes? Phoenix: Tell me straight: were you really in your dressing room? You didn't go to the studio? Will: I-I didn't go to the studio! I was s-sleeping, honest. Maya: So who was the \"Steel Samurai\" in that security photo? Will: How should I know? The Steel Samurai costume was off in the corner of the dressing room. Anyone could have walked in and taken it, really. Maya: What!? You should take better care of that stuff! Will: I couldn't imagine anyone would want to steal a Steel Samurai costume! So... where does this leave me? Phoenix: It doesn't look good... Will: *sniff* Phoenix: You're the only likely suspect, right now. Maya: Nick! W-what are we going to do!? Phoenix: First, we play for more time. We'll start targeting someone else that could conceivably have done this! Maya: Right! And it'll take them so long to shoot us down that we can get another day! Phoenix: Right... but if we pick the wrong person, we might lose on the spot. Will: You... don't sound very optimistic. Phoenix: I'm not optimistic at all, actually. Maya: Hey, Nick. It's time. Phoenix: Okay. Let's go. *sigh* Will: What does that mean... Please don't sigh like that! *sniff* Judge: Court will now reconvene for the trial of Mr. Will Powers. (Changed from [The court will now reconvene for the trial of Mr. Will Powers.] in the original release) Mr. Edgeworth, will you present the prosecution's thoughts on this matter? Edgeworth: The prosecution's thoughts are simple. Nothing has changed. The other person who went to the studios was a boy of roughly 10 years of age. The photo we do have may not be hard evidence... But there is still no one else that could have committed this crime! I call for a verdict of \"guilty\" for the defendant, Mr. Will Powers! Judge: Hmm... Very well. Mr. Wright, your thoughts? Phoenix: The defense disagrees with the prosecution's claim. There IS another person who could have committed this crime! Judge: Order! Interesting... Let us hear who you have in mind! However... Be aware that this court does not look kindly on accusing the innocent. If you accuse someone who is obviously innocent, you will be penalized. Phoenix: (Right. Great. As if the stakes weren't high enough.) Judge: So, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder? The assistant girl Phoenix: It was the assistant! The Steel Samurai costume was in his dressing room. She stole it, and in doing so she became the Steel Samurai! Judge: So you're saying the Steel Samurai in the picture is really the assistant? Phoenix: That's correct, Your Honor! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: If you're serious, you've got guts, Mr. Wright. Remember the photo? Wasn't the Steel Samurai a little lame!? He was dragging his foot! Phoenix: Oh. (Uh oh. Bad feeling time.) Edgeworth: Remember the testimony concerning Powers's injury!!! Oldbag: Powers and poor Hammer were at the run-through. Oh, and me. Phoenix: What about the assistant? Oldbag: Oh, her? She was cleaning up backdrops, I think. She didn't know about Powers's ankle. Edgeworth: The assistant knew nothing of Mr. Power's injury! She could look the Steel Samurai look with that costume... But she couldn't walk the the Steel Samurai walk! She wouldn't have limped! Phoenix: Ungh! Maya: That kind of takes the legs out from under that case... Judge: Mr. Wright. I'm afraid I have to penalize you, as I warned. Phoenix: (Nobody knows... the trouble I've seen...) Judge: May we move on, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: (Grr... this fight isn't over yet!) If you would, Your Honor, one more chance, please. Judge: Very well. Go ahead. Leads back to: \"So, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder?\" The grade-school boy Phoenix: It was the grade-school boy! ... ... ... Why isn't anyone saying anything? Edgeworth: Bah! Are you seriously suggesting the boy did it, Mr. Wright!? \"Grade-school boy kills veteran action star with spear!\" For one thing, it was the Steel Samurai holding the murder weapon. Would you care to explain just how the boy was involved? Phoenix: (Hmm... maybe that was a dumb move on my part.) Maya: \"Maybe\"? \"Maybe\"!? How about \"absolutely,\" Nick! Judge: Mr. Wright. I'm afraid I have to penalize you, as I warned. Phoenix: (Nobody knows... the trouble I've seen...) Judge: May we move on, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: (Grr... this fight isn't over yet!) If you would, Your Honor, one more chance, please. Judge: Very well. Go ahead. Leads back to: \"So, who was this person other than Mr. Powers that could have committed murder?\" The security lady Leads to: \"It was the security lady! Wendy Oldbag!\" Phoenix: It was the security lady! Wendy Oldbag! Oldbag: W-who!? Phoenix: The Steel Samurai is dragging his leg in this picture. That means whoever was in the suit knew about that morning's injury. Maybe because... they had been watching the action scene run-through! There was only one person other than Powers and Hammer who knew about the injury. The security lady, Oldbag! Oldbag: W-what!? Whippersnapper! Judge: Order! Order! I-is this true, Oldbag!? Oldbag: Oldbag!? That's Ms. Oldbag to you! Phoenix: Ms. Oldbag was standing guard alone at the main gate. She was by herself... in other words, she has no alibi! She could have briefly left her post to steal the the Steel Samurai costume... Then slipped into Studio One, the scene of the murder! Judge: W-why would she go through the trouble of wearing the Steel Samurai costume!? Phoenix: Simple, Your Honor. She knew the camera at the gate would take her picture. If she was in his costume, she could point the finger at Mr. Powers! Judge: I see! Excellent deductive reasoning, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Ohhh yeah, right here! Sherlock Holmes II, baby!) ...? (That's odd. Isn't this the part where Edgeworth pounces...? Doesn't he usually jump up with an objection and some new damning evidence...?) Judge: Well, Mr. Edgeworth? Does the prosecution have an opinion on this matter? Edgeworth: ... The prosecution has no meaningful objections at this time. Oldbag: W-w-what!? What's that supposed to mean!? Oh, so you all think I did it? Is that it!? Edgey-boy! Don't just sit there, do something! Phoenix: (What's my move? Maybe now's my chance to take this the whole way?) Press further Leads to: \"The very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case...\" Give granny a break Phoenix: (I guess this does kind of make it look like she's the killer. Funny, I feel bad for her all of a sudden.) Judge: Hmm... It's true that the witness could conceivably have committed this crime. Yet we must not forget that the victim was an action hero. As formidable as her personality may be, I doubt she'd be strong enough. Phoenix: (Uh oh! If he removes her from consideration, that means Mr. Powers is it! Sorry, windbag... but I don't have a choice.) Leads to: \"The very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case...\" Phoenix: The very same reasoning that makes Mr. Powers a suspect in this case... can be used to cast doubt on Ms. Oldbag's actions on that day! Oldbag: B-but why would I do something so horrible to poor Hammer!? Phoenix: You forget that Mr. Powers lacks a clear motive, too. Judge: Hmm... Indeed. Phoenix: (That did it. Now windbag is one of the suspects. No hard feelings... I hope.) Oldbag: Wait just a minute! What about the other person who went to the studio!? The boy! The one whose photo I erased! Judge: He's only a grade schooler though, as you said. 2nd or 3rd grade, was it? Oldbag: Th-that doesn't matter! When I was that age, I could pin my old man in 10 seconds, tops! Judge: Hmm... Your thoughts, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: That boy is not the killer. Oldbag: What!? How can you be so sure! Oh, or is it be nice to the kids and mean to your elders day? Whippersnapper! Phoenix: I have proof. Oldbag: P-proof!? Judge: Indeed? Then let's see this proof, Mr. Wright. You have proof that shows the boy could not have committed this murder? Present Cardkey Phoenix: Phoenix: The scene of the murder, as we all know, was Studio One. However, you need a cardkey to enter Studio One! How could a boy with no formal relation to the studios have a cardkey!? Leads to: \"I see!\" Present Powers's(?) Photo or Samurai Spear Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! The murder weapon was the Samurai Spear. That very spear is shown here in this photo. How could the boy have taken the spear? It's impossible! Leads to: \"I see!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This is my proof! Judge: ... I can't see how that has anything to do with this matter, Mr. Wright? Mr. Wright. There aren't that many pieces of evidence in the Court Record. Please try not to pick the wrong ones! Phoenix: S-sorry, Your Honor. Judge: I'll ask again, Mr. Wright. Leads back to: \"You have proof that shows the boy could not have committed this murder?\" Judge: I see! Well, would the witness care to comment on this? Oldbag: Mrph. Phoenix: (The windbag... speechless. This has got to be a first.) Judge: Very well! This court will suspend proceedings on the current trial for today. Mr. Edgeworth, please find out more about your witness, Ms. Windy... what was her name? Edgeworth: Something \"Oldbag,\" Your Honor. Judge: Then the prosecution will look further into this Oldbag before we continue! That is all. The court is adjourned! Oldbag: W-wait a second! I'm not going to just sit here while you run off barking up the wrong tree... me! I'm talking! Maya: Oh, great, stop the presses! The windbag wants to talk! Judge: Ms. Oldbag! What is this all about? Have you omitted something from your testimony? Oldbag: Actually, if you must know, there's something I was told not to talk about. Phoenix: N-not to talk about? Edgeworth: By whom!? Phoenix: (Huh? You mean it wasn't Edgeworth who told her not to talk...?) Judge: W-well, testify! Witness Testimony -- My Lips Were Sealed -- Oldbag: Global Studios wanted me to keep quiet about something. There were... some other people at the studios on the day of the murder. They said they had \"nothing to do with it,\" see? So they told me to just pretend they \"hadn't been at the studios that day.\" But if you're going to go accusing me, I'm not letting them get away scot free! Judge: M-Ms. Oldbag! This is crucial information! Why did you keep this from the court until now!? Oldbag: Ain't you been listening? They told me to shut my trap, and I always do what I'm told. Judge: ... Phoenix: (No, this isn't a bad dream, Your Honor. Witness the power of the Oldbag...) Judge: Mr. Wright... Your cross-examination. Cross Examination -- My Lips Were Sealed -- Oldbag: Global Studios wanted me to keep quiet about something. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, you were told not to talk? Oldbag: That's right! By the studio and TV bigwigs, no less! Edgeworth: Why didn't I hear about this!? Oldbag: Don't be too hard on yourself, sonny. We were all in on it. Oldbag: There were... some other people at the studios on the day of the murder. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: W-who were these people!? Oldbag: Well, the director and the producer, for starters... Phoenix: The... director? Edgeworth: We should have known something was fishy! How could they have done a run-through of their action scene without a director? Of course! Oldbag: Yes, well, I was surprised no one asked about it. Phoenix: So, where were these people? Oldbag: The director was in the Employee Area all morning for the run-through. He joined the producer around lunchtime and they had a meeting after that. Edgeworth: Where! Oldbag: Oh, in the Studio Two trailer. Phoenix: S-Studio Two...!? (There was a Studio Two...?) Oldbag: Well, if you look at the guidemap... Here it is. You go through the gate and all the way to the left. Phoenix: (The path where the monkey's head was fallen over.) Judge: Well, Mr. Wright... Would you like to continue the cross-examination...? Phoenix: (I think I've already asked all my questions, but...) Continue cross-examination Leads back to cross-examination Take a break Leads to: \"Your Honor.\" Oldbag: They said they had \"nothing to do with it,\" see? Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Ms. Oldbag! This is a trial for murder! Oldbag: I know that, silly! Still, they were pretty convincing about having nothing to do with it. And... they gave me a little bonus on the side. Phoenix: (So, you got your \"bonus\" and you still talked... Hmm. I think I've asked all the questions I have to ask...) Continue cross-examination Phoenix: (I guess there's no harm in getting as much info as I can!) Leads back to cross-examination Take a break Leads to: \"Your Honor.\" Oldbag: So they told me to just pretend they \"hadn't been at the studios that day.\" Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So they were actually in the studio!? Oldbag: Yes, the whole day. When they heard about the murder, they beat it before the cops came. Edgeworth: *grumble* (I'll kill this woman, I swear it...) Phoenix: (I feel sorry for Edgeworth, almost. She really left him hanging on this one.) Oldbag: But if you're going to go accusing me, I'm not letting them get away scot free! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Them\"...? W-who were these people!? Oldbag: Well, the director and the producer, for starters... Phoenix: The... director? Edgeworth: We should have known something was fishy! How could they have done a run-through of their action scene without a director? Of course! Oldbag: Yes, well, I was surprised no one asked about it. Phoenix: So, where were these people? Oldbag: The director was in the Employee Area all morning for the run-through. He joined the producer around lunchtime and they had a meeting after that. Edgeworth: Where! Oldbag: Oh, in the Studio Two trailer. Phoenix: S-Studio Two...!? (There was a Studio Two...?) Oldbag: Well, if you look at the guidemap... Here it is. You go through the gate and all the way to the left. Phoenix: (The path where the monkey's head was fallen over.) Judge: Well, Mr. Wright... Would you like to continue the cross-examination...? Phoenix: (I think I've already asked all my questions, but...) Continue cross-examination Leads back to cross-examination Take a break Leads to: \"Your Honor.\" Maya: Nick! I guess pressing her was the right thing to do! For an old windbag, she sure likes keeping secrets... Let's get as much information as we can! Phoenix: Your Honor. We have learned there were others at Global Studios on the day in question. The director and the producer and, er, some bigwigs, were all present. Yet, as we stand here, they have not been questioned! I hold that it is impossible to declare a verdict on the defendant, Mr. Powers! Judge: Hmm... The court acknowledges the defense's point. The prosecution will gather more information about the witness, Ms. Oldbag... and more information about these other people we have just been told of! Edgeworth: ... I understand, Your Honor. Judge: This ends the day's proceedings in the trial of Mr. Will Powers. That is all. The court is adjourned! October 18, 1:04 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3 Will: Th-thank you so much, Mr. Wright. I was right to ask you to defend me. Maya: Aww, really, it's nothing. *grin* Oh, or should I... *sniff* Phoenix: We'll be going down to the studios to do some more investigation. We have to find out more about this director and producer. They'll be turning up in the next trial as witnesses for certain. So now's my chance to get material for the cross-examination! Maya: So, Nick... Have we figured out just who it was in that Steel Samurai costume? Could it really have been old windbag? Phoenix: What do you think, Mr. Powers? Will: I don't think it was her, really. Maya: Neither do I, Nick. Phoenix: Y-yeah, I know! Look, I was just buying time back there. Someone had to be the bad guy for a bit to take the pressure off Mr. Powers. Maya: Poor old windbag... I feel kinda sorry for her. Phoenix: Well, she wasn't winning any points in there, with or without my accusation. Okay, let's get down to the studios. Maya: Right! We'll be back to visit you soon... Will: Th-thanks. Thanks, guys. *sniff* To be continued. Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement? Judge: Uh... I'm not sure I follow? Phoenix: It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought... Judge: You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence! Judge: ...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory... Phoenix: Huh? Really? Judge: Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (Whoops! That didn't go so well.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor! Judge: How exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...? Phoenix: They aren't, are they... Judge: Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor! Judge: ... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Ugh, I must be on the wrong track?) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! This court see no reason to further prolong the trial. Nor is there any need for more time to decide the case against the defendant. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for mis-interpretation of the facts. Phoenix: (W-what!? I see plenty of room! It\u2019s still wide open... no?) Judge: This court find the defendant, Mr. Will Powers... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned! Turnabout Samurai Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 Part 5 Part 6 October 18Wright & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: Whew, what a day. Maya: This is no time for relaxing, Nick! Say, you think WP's got a chance? Phoenix: I guess that really depends on the people we found out about in today's trial. Maya: The director and producer...? Phoenix: Yeah, them. Maya: Well, what are we doing here then!? Let's get to the studios! Talk What to do Phoenix: What do you think we should do? Maya: W-what do I... huh!? Why don't we do what you just said!? We gotta get the scoop on this director and producer. Phoenix: Oh, right. Then there's no point hanging out here. Maya: That's what I've been saying! Let's get to those studios pronto! Any ideas Maya: Hmm. We don't have enough information to make a case yet. Phoenix: That's exactly the same thing you said yesterday! Just admit it: you don't have a clue what happened. Maya: There's not enough information! Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Hey, see this? Maya: You... really like showing that off, don't you, Nick? Cardkey Maya: Hey, you still have that! Great! Phoenix: Well, we couldn't get into the scene of the murder without it. And its owner isn't missing it in his detention cell... Maya: Poor old WP... Powers's(?) Photo Maya: You know, what if this really was Mr. Powers? Phoenix: Yeah. It's hard to say. We don't really know anyone else it could be. I seriously doubt it was that old windbag. Maya: So Mr. Powers is... lying? Phoenix: He really doesn't seem the type, does he. (Curiouser and curiouser...) Samurai Spear Maya: I wish I had my own Samurai Spear! You'd by my own personal pincushion, Nick! Phoenix: Me!? Why me!? Anything else Maya: Sorry, I don't know how that will help us figure this out. October 18Detention CenterVisitor's Room Will: Oh, Mr. Wright! Thank you for earlier. Phoenix: Not at all. We got lucky, to tell the truth. Maya: You can say that again! Phoenix: Let's not. Maya: So, WP! Do you have any leads that might get us going in the right direction? Will: Hmm... S-sorry, but no. Maya: Be sure to tell us anything that comes to mind, no matter how small. Phoenix: We can't rely on getting lucky again tomorrow. Will: Y-yes... *sniff* Examine Security guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. Talk The fanboy Phoenix: Do, er, \"fanboys\" sneak into the studios often? Will: No, not that I know of. That security lady's pretty strict with them. Maya: But, in today's testimony, didn't she say they were often hanging around? Will: The kids really, really love the Steel Samurai. They sneak past when she's not looking, I guess. The director Phoenix: Was the director present at the morning run-through? Will: Y-yes, yes he was. He was directing how the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate should move. Maya: Why didn't you tell us that before!? Will: W-well, just, the studio asked us to keep quiet... Maya: That has nothing to do with this! I hate to repeat myself, but Nick here is a newbie lawyer! Fresh off the bar! When he loses, he's going to lose big! Will: I... I see. *sniff* Phoenix: (Whose side is she on!?) Maya: You aren't hiding anything else from us, are you!? Will: N-no, I sure hope not. Present Cardkey Phoenix: We found this cardkey in your dressing room. Will: Oh, that's mine, yes. Maya: Can people outside the studios get these cards? Will: I don't think so. Even I have to return the card. Once the show's done filming, that is. Maya: Huh... Powers's(?) Photo Phoenix: Regarding this photograph... Will: Y-yes...? Phoenix: This really, truly, absolutely isn't you, right? Will: R-right. *sniff* I was sleeping in my dressing room the whole time, honest. Phoenix: But who else could have worn it!? Maya: Your costume was in your dressing room? Will: Yes. I guess they snuck in and took it while I was asleep. Phoenix: (But who!?) Samurai Spear Phoenix: Regarding the murder weapon... Will: Yes? Phoenix: Is it heavy, that spear? Will: It's pretty hefty, yeah. I don't think the average person would be able to swing it around effectively. Phoenix: Hmm... Maya: And... that's the spear that broke or something during the morning run-through? Will: Oh yes, I goofed on a round kick, you see... I broke the spear. The security lady fixed it for me right away though. Maya: With duct tape. We heard. Anything else Will: E-excuse me. Thank you for showing me that, whatever it is. I wish I could think of some way I could help you... S-sorry. *sniff* October 18, 2:16 PMGlobal StudiosMain Gate Maya: No one's here. Phoenix: Right, now that they have Ms. Oldbag in custody. I guess they don't have anyone else to replace her... Maya: H-hey! In the guard station! Look! She left her donuts! ... ... What? I wasn't going to eat them! Examine Computer Phoenix: The computer that runs the studio security cameras. Huh? It looks like it's been turned off for the day. Guard station Phoenix: The security guard station. Ms. Oldbag must like junk food. There's a mountain of it on the desk in there. Main gate Phoenix: The main entrance to the studios. They probably have a police officer on patrol out there. October 18Studio One Entrance Maya: Hey, Nick. It looks like Detective Gumshoe isn't here today. Phoenix: You're right. He's probably up to his neck in paperwork after the commotion at today's trial. Maya: So, Nick... Remember that \"Studio Two\" we heard about at the trial today? It was down that path with the fallen tree, right? Phoenix: Yeah, I think that's what they said. Maya: Maybe the director and the rest of them are there today? Now's our chance, Nick! Let's check it out! Examine Bench Phoenix: I'm bushed. Maybe I'll sit down here for a bit. Maya: This is exactly why I don't want to get old, ever. Phoenix: H-hey! I'm still young! I'm just tired! Maya: Nick, when you start having to say \"I'm still young,\" you know it's all over. Phoenix: (But... but I AM still young!) Left path Phoenix: In the trial, they said Studio Two was down this path. The monkey head is in the way, but we should be able to get by it without a problem. Maya: This monkey head is real heavy! Phoenix: Well, it did knock that tree over when it fell. Maya: Both of these, the monkey head and the tree, fell the day of the murder, didn't they. Phoenix: Yeah, that's what Detective Gumshoe said. Statue with broken head Phoenix: The studio mascot. Apparently it's a monkey of some kind. I've never seen a monkey with a nose like that before! Maya: Why don't they put his head back on? Maybe we should ask that assistant? Phoenix: I'm not sure we really want her fixing anything. And you'd probably need a crane to move that thing. Maya: Probably so. Security camera Phoenix: That's the security camera that automatically takes pictures of people here. It took two pictures on the day of the murder, before the actual time of death. One of them was the Steel Samurai. The other was a grade school boy. It doesn't seem to be switched on today. Studio One entrance Phoenix: The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body. Welcome sign Maya: It says \"Welcome.\" Phoenix: They let people in here when they're not filming, right? Maya: Nick! Let's come here some day! Whaddya say? Phoenix: Sure, if that security lady lets us in. October 18Studio One Maya: I... don't really want to be in here. Phoenix: Yeah... It is a murder scene. Maya: I want to go someplace else. Nick? Phoenix: (*sigh*...) Examine Film camera Maya: Wow, look at that camera! That must cost a ton! Phoenix: Yeah! So don't touch it! Maya: Hey, smile, Nick, you're a star! Phoenix: S-stop that! Reflecting screen Phoenix: That's for reflecting light. They call it a reflecting screen or something like that. Maya: Huh. Phoenix: What? Where's your enthusiasm for all things entertainment? Maya: Well, lighting is fine, but I'd want to be the director. Or maybe the Steel Samurai! Phoenix: (I think she's being serious...!) Stage backdrop Phoenix: Looks like a backdrop for a stage. This must be used in the Steel Samurai show. Maya: Of course! That's the mountain, Neo Fujiyama! Phoenix: Doesn't the Steel Samurai take place in Olde Tokyo? Can you even see Mt. Fuji from there? Maya: Not Olde Tokyo, Nick! \"Neo\" Olde Tokyo! October 18Studio Two Entrance Maya: This... is Studio Two? Phoenix: I thought so... Maya: It doesn't really look much like a \"studio,\" does it? Phoenix: No, that it does not. Maya: Hey... There's a trailer over there. Phoenix: It looks pretty sturdy for a movie set trailer. Maya: Are we sure this is a studio? Examine Incinerator Phoenix: An incinerator. Apparently they just put this one in. It's already covered in soot. They must not clean it much. Lunch table Phoenix: Looks like two people ate here. There's nothing left on the plates. Maya: Hey, so they ate t-bone steaks too. Phoenix: What is it with steaks around here? Maya: Hey! There's always room for steak! But... something does seem out of place... Phoenix: What? Maya: I... don't know. It just feels \"odd.\" Number \"2\" sign Phoenix: There's a big \"2\" painted here. Maya: Probably because this is Studio Two? Phoenix: Probably... Though it doesn't look anything like a studio. Studio van Phoenix: A light van for moving staff and equipment around. They've kept it in pretty good shape. Looks like it'd run fine. Maya: Well, let's go for a drive! Phoenix: Sure... if I had a license. Maya: Nick! You don't have a driver's license!? Phoenix: But, look, I have this! Maya: Why are you showing me your attorney's badge, Nick? Flower garden Phoenix: There're some flowers here. Maya: Wow, so pretty! They're taking good care of these. Phoenix: Don't get to [sic] close. That fence looks dangerous. Storage materials Phoenix: These look like materials for making a movie set. Maya: They've been sitting here for quite some time. This might as well be a junkyard. Trailer Phoenix: On closer inspection, this trailer looks like it's been here for a while. I don't think this is part of some temporary film set. Trailer door Maya: Nick! Let's go inside! Phoenix: You think it's okay...? Oh well. It's locked. Maya: Aww... shucks. October 18Global StudiosEmployee Area Maya: Look, it's that assistant girl. Hey! Penny: Hi... WP's lawyers, right? I heard about the trial! Great job, guys! Phoenix: Oh? Oh hoh hoh. Don't mention it. Penny: Is it true they caught the security lady!? Phoenix: Oh! Oh... oh hoh hoh! Penny: Actually, she just called me. She told me to cover up that drain... Phoenix: You mean that one? (Wow, what a mess...) Penny: I... I know... I'm not so good with handiwork. Some assistant, right? Maya: Yeah, but you do work on the props, and the backdrops, right? Penny: R-right. Just... lots of times they end up looking worse than they did before I fixed them. Maya: Oh? Oh! Well, I'm sure these things happen. Nothing to worry yourself about! Penny: You're right! I won't! Phoenix: (Personally, I think she should worry at least a little bit more...) Penny: Um, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to the guard station. I'm supposed to fill in for Ms. Oldbag. Maya: Right! See you later, then! Penny: Good luck with your investigation. Examine Taped cardboard barrier Maya: So, the fanboy they were talking about in the trial today... He came in through that drain? Phoenix: So it seems. I guess they covered it up in a hurry. Maya: Hey... Hey, Nick! If that drain's covered, the boy won't be able to get in. Phoenix: Uh, yeah. I think that was the idea...? Maya: I feel kinda sorry for him, though. Don't you? Phoenix: What, you want to rip the grate off? Maya: Really, Nick? We can!? Phoenix: (Whoa... she's serious? Uh oh...) Rip it open Phoenix: Well, I guess some things are just made to be broken. Maya: Yay! You know, Nick, you're pretty swell sometimes. Phoenix: (Sometimes...?) Maya: Hiii-ya! There. That should make the kids happy. Phoenix: The things we do... Leads back to examination Leave it be Phoenix: Nah, I think we should leave it on. They only just repaired it. And if we take it off, that assistant will get yelled at by you-know-who. Maya: Yeah... I guess so. Phoenix: (Wow! I didn't expect her to take it that hard...) Leads back to examination Drain grate (after selecting \"Rip it open\" upon examining taped cardboard barrier) Phoenix: The drain grate is off. And I know who did it. Maya: Now the kids'll be able to come in again. Doesn't it make you feel great to do a good deed like that? Phoenix: (Must be nice to live so free of guilt.) Lunch table Phoenix: The remains of yesterday's lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak. Dressing room door Phoenix: The door to the dressing room. It's not locked. Maya: Hey, Nick! Let's go in! Maybe there'll be something else to steal? Phoenix: H-hey! We're not thieves! Maya: But we did take that cardkey... Phoenix: W-we borrowed that! There's a difference. Vending machine Phoenix: Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks or something. Popcorn, at least! Maya: W-wait! Look! \"Samurai Soda\"! Nick! Try this! Phoenix: Be my guest. Maya: Okay! Oh, too bad, it's sold out. October 18Global StudiosDressing Room Maya: This is where the Steel Samurai costume was, on the day of the murder. Phoenix: That's what Mr. Powers says, at least. I guess they snuck in and took it while he was sleeping. Maya: But Nick, what if Mr. Powers hadn't been sleeping? I wonder what the killer was planning on doing then? Phoenix: Huh... (She's got a point!) Examine Cosmetics Phoenix: There's an array of cosmetics here. According to Maya, that wig was used in some old TV show... Maya: \"Samurai Boogey-Woogey,\" Nick! Get with the picture! Phoenix: Look, explain to me how you can identify a show just by seeing a wig!? Maya: I, um, kinda like samurai movies. Phoenix: (\"Kinda\"...?) Costume rack Phoenix: There's some regular suits in among the costumes here. Those must be Mr. Powers's personal clothes. Couch Phoenix: Looks like someone was sleeping here. Maybe Powers did take a nap here, like he said. Bag Maya: Mr. Powers's bag. I wonder what's inside? Hey! Supermarket tabloids? Wow. I'm kind of shocked. Phoenix: Maya! Leave those alone! (Wolf Men Found On Mars...? I'll have to buy that issue!) Table Phoenix: There's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Some tea and cookies... Maya: Wait... Nick! Phoenix: W-what now? Maya: These snacks... they've passed the expiration date! Phoenix: ... Then don't eat them. Maya: *grumble* (They're snacks! They're meant to be eaten!) Window Phoenix: It's locked. I guess he doesn't open his window much. It is kind of dusty outside. Studio - Main Gate (after selecting \"Rip it open\" upon examining taped cardboard barrier in Global Studios - Employee Area) Penny: Oh... hello. Maya: Ho hoh! You look a little out of place. Penny: It's the clothes, isn't it? I thought my camo vest might do the trick... Kind of an \"alternative guard fashion\" thing. Examine Guard station Phoenix: The security guard station. I can see the computer that runs the security cameras. Penny: Oh, please don't touch anything in there. The security lady would knock the stuffing out of me if she knew. Talk The studios Phoenix: So, how are the studios doing? Penny: There's police wandering around everywhere, it's terrible. They won't even let me clean up. Don't want me \"disturbing evidence.\" I haven't even cleaned up our lunch plates from the day of the murder! Phoenix: You mean those plates with the steak bones left over on them in the employee area? Penny: Yeah. Can you believe it? The fanboy Maya: Do kids sneak in here a lot? Penny: Well... I don't think there's that many of them, but I do see one in particular a bunch. He's always gawking at the sets, or snapping pictures. You should see Old Windbag's eyes flash when she sees him. She has a bit of trouble catching him though... The director, et al. Phoenix: I heard something at the trial today. They said that the director and producer were here the day of the murder... Penny: Oh, sorry... I was in the prop storage room, so I didn't see them. I guess they were here, though. The studio head seemed pretty eager to keep us quiet. Maya: So they were trying to protect the director? Penny: More the producer, really. The producer's our real star here. She saved these studios from the brink of disaster and kept them running. I don't think we'd still be in business if it weren't for that producer! Phoenix: (The producer, huh?) Present Cardkey Penny: Wow, they gave a lawyer one of those cardkeys? Phoenix: Well, I'm sort of borrowing it. Penny: I see. You better be careful not to lose that. They're very strict about those cardkeys here. Phoenix: (I guess they're pretty good about keeping these out of outsider's hands.) Thanks, I'll be careful. Powers's(?) Photo Phoenix: Could you take a look at this? Penny: That's Mr. Powers. Why is he dragging his leg like that? What is this, anyway? Phoenix: (Looks like she didn't know about this photo or the injury that morning.) Uh... Never mind. Samurai Spear Phoenix: Say, you work with the props, right? About that murder weapon... Penny: You mean the Samurai Spear? Yeah, it's a prop, but it's still pretty heavy. I hate having to carry that thing around. Phoenix: (So you'd have to be pretty strong to use that as a weapon, it sounds like. Why is Mr. Powers the only person I can think of!?) Anything else Penny: Umm... Not really sure what that is. Sorry. Dressing Room (after clearing \"The director, et al.\" Talk option in Global Studios - Main Gate) ???: WTF? Who are j00 d00dz!? LMAO! Maya: H-huh!? W-we... Wait, you first! Who are you!? You look pretty suspicious to me! ???: Whatever, l4m3rs! Manella: How can j00 not know the great Sal Manella!? I make teh L33T SH0WZ! The Steel Samurai? Mine! RTFC! (Read The Film Credits!) Maya: R-really!? You're THE Sal Manella!? I'm so sorry! I, just, you looked so... Sorry! Manella: No no, quite alright. Really. It's fine. ROFL! ... Maya: W-what is it? Manella: You know, on closer inspection... Mmm... Yeah... Hot! Hot! Hot! *slobber* Hey, do j00 do a lot of \"cosplay,\" coz that costume r0x0rz!... *drool* Maya: Rocksores!? Wh-wh-what... Hey! You're drooling! Manella: Huh? Mmph! LOL! Buffer overrun! *pant* You've triggered my CR34T1V3 P0W3RZ! Yes... yes, it's coming to me! \"Pink Princess\"! The sequel to the Steel Samurai... \"Pink Princess: Warrior of Little Olde Tokyo!\" ROFL... LMAO! Phoenix: P-\"Pink Princess\"...? Maya: Why's it gotta be \"Little\" Olde Tokyo!? Why can't it have a cool name, like \"Neo Olde Tokyo\"!? Phoenix: Maya, we really need to talk about \"cool\"... Examine Table Phoenix: There's a bunch of snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Maya: H-hey! Nick! Phoenix: W-what now? Maya: Th-the snacks! There was twice this much here before! Manella: Ah. I, uh, I ate them. They were past their expiration date anyway. ROFL! Maya: ... Phoenix: (She's biting her lip and staring at me with tears welling in her eyes...) Talk The day of the crime Phoenix: Did you notice anything unusual on the day of the murder? Manella: Oh, I know who j00 d00dz are. That security lady told j00 about us, eh? Phoenix: That's right. Manella: It was a pretty regular day. We had a run-through for an action scene in the morning. Then a meeting from lunchtime in the Studio Two trailer. Heh. I was so busy I didn't even get a chance to eat lunch!\u00a0:( Phoenix: A t-bone steak, was it? Manella: Yeah... sux0rz! I hate missing out on food... Maya: Nick... what does \"Sucksores\" mean? Phoenix: No idea... Manella: Anyway, I was in a meeting from noon till after 4:00. With the producer, and some bigwigs from the network. Phoenix: (Mr. Hammer's time of death was estimated at 2:30 PM. If he's telling the truth, that meeting gives him an alibi...) The producer (appears after \"The day of the crime\") Phoenix: About the producer who was at the meeting with you... Manella: Oh, you mean Dee Vasquez? She's a genius. M4d sk1llz, all the way. Scary, though. *sweats* She brought these studios back from the brink of destruction. She's the one who made it possible for me to make the Steel Samurai! Phoenix: You had a meeting with her on the day of the murder, right? Manella: Yeah, we were together from noon to 4:00 PM, the whole time. The bigwigs (appears after \"The day of the crime\") Phoenix: Who exactly are these \"bigwigs\" people keep mentioning? Manella: Oh, the boss over at the network, and some sponsors. Also a few production guys. They piled into a limousine and got here right around noon. Major tension! *sweats* Phoenix: Were all of them with you the entire time? Manella: Yeah, unfortunately. They're all gray-haired geezers... *scowl* Phoenix: (Hmm... sounds like they'd all be reliable witnesses.) Present Powers's(?) Photo Manella: ... T-this is WP, right? Phoenix: How do you know? Manella: Well, look, he's obviously dragging his foot. Phoenix: (Oh, right. The director would know about the injury; he was there.) Anything else Manella: I try not to pay much attention to things that don't interest me. LOL. Maya: W-why are you staring at me like that...? October 18Studio Two Entrance Phoenix: (This place is deserted...) *crash!* Maya: Eek! N-N-Nick! W-w-what was that noise!? It sounded like it came from inside the trailer... Phoenix: Someone must be inside... Maya: H-Hello? ... Phoenix: No answer. Maya: Pretty suspicious, if you ask me, Nick! Let's go in! Phoenix: I'm not sure we should be barging in... ...Huh. It's locked. Maya: What? Don't we have a key? Phoenix: No. But there's probably one in the guard station at the main gate. Maya: Then what are we waiting for? Let's borrow it! Phoenix: (If they'll let us...) Examine Trailer door Phoenix: The trailer door. It's locked. The key is probably in the security guard station. I doubt they'd let us borrow it. Studio - Main Gate (after visiting Studio Two Entrance and visiting Global Studios - Dressing Room after clearing \"The director, et al.\" Talk option in Global Studios - Main Gate) Oldbag: Ah hah! You again! Maya: Eeeek! Oldbag: How rude, acting like you've seen a ghost! Phoenix: You... certainly got back to your post quickly. Oldbag: Oh the police took me away, they did. They pulled out a spare Steel Samurai costume! Told me to \"put it on.\" Can you imagine? How could I, a sweet little old lady, wear a giant suit like that? Phoenix: Mr. Powers is pretty tall... Oldbag: As soon as they saw there was no way I could wear it, they let me go. Phoenix: (I guess that would rule out her being the murderer.) Oldbag: Anyway! Know this, whippersnapper! This old lady NEVER forgets a slight or insult! And you won't get any information out of me! My lips are sealed! Maya: You sure are talking a lot for someone with sealed lips. Oldbag: Starting now! One, two, three, mmmph! Phoenix: (This lady's too much...) Examine Guard station Phoenix: The security guard station. I can see the computer that runs the security cameras. Oldbag: Hey! No touching! Phoenix: (Guess I'd better investigate there later...) Talk The Fanboy Phoenix: Umm, about that kid you said you saw... Oldbag: If I see him again, I'm taking him down! Maya: N-Nick! Look at her eyes! She's serious! The director, et al. Phoenix: About the dirctor, the one who was here on the day of the murder... Oldbag: If I see him again, I'm taking him down! Maya: Nick! I think she's losing it! Present Anything Phoenix: (I have a feeling she's not going to respond well to anything I show her now.) Employee Area (after visiting Studio Two Entrance and visiting Global Studios - Dressing Room after clearing \"The director, et al.\" Talk option at Global Studios - Main Gate, then revisiting Global Studios - Main Gate) Maya: Hey! H-hey! Wait! Phoenix: (I'll bet he came in right through that drain...) Maya: Hey, um, kiddy-o! What's yer name, sport? ???: I'm not a kid, so don't talk to me like that! Maya: H-huh!? But you... You are a kid! What a rude little brat. That's no way to talk to an adult! ???: I don't see no adults here! Hippie fashion chick! Maya: H-hippie fashion...? Nick... I think I'm being mocked. Phoenix: (You got to hand it to Maya, she's pretty sharp. And pretty mad...) Cody: I'm Cody! Cody Hackins. Call me \"kiddy-o\" again and I'll cut you down where you stand, evildoer! Examine Drain grate Phoenix: The drain where the fanboy came in. He didn't waste any time coming in, either. Talk about cause and effect. Talk The Steel Samurai Phoenix: So, you're a fan of the Steel Samurai? Cody: How dare you utter that name, evildoer! Maya: What do you mean? We're on the Steel Samurai's side! Cody: H-hah! Hah hah! You can't fool me! Maya: Okay... then what's the last line said by the innkeeper in Episode 8? Cody: Hah! Easy! \"Like some fries with that?\" Maya: Hmph... not bad, kiddy-o. Cody: Watch it! Phoenix: (What are they doing!?) What happened Leads to: \"Say, you heard anything about the incident the other day?\" Present Anything Cody: Evildoers! Phoenix: Say, you heard anything about the incident the other day? Cody: ... Maya: You were here, weren't you? Cody: ... Phoenix: Did you see anything...? Cody: He... he... Phoenix: ? Cody: He... always... The Steel Samurai always wins! Always! Yeah, I saw 'em! I saw everything! Maya: What!? Cody: But... but no way am I telling you losers! Maya: Wha--!? Wait... Cody: Lemme go! Maya: ... He's gone. Huh? Something fell off the table when he bumped into it on his way out. Phoenix: A... bottle? Why was this sitting there, I wonder? Empty Bottle slipped into pocket. Phoenix: Anyway, what was that kid saying? Maya: He \"saw everything\"... Studio - Main Gate Maya: Huh? Where's that old windbag? Phoenix: Odd of her to leave her post... Oldbag: (H-hey!!!) Maya: Nick! That was her! Oldbag: (S-stop! Whippersnapper!) Phoenix: Y-yeah. Sounds like she's chasing after that boy. Oldbag: Natch! Maya: Uh oh, she tripped! Phoenix: (Maya sure looks happy...) Examine Guard station Maya: Hey, hey, Nick. Now's our chance! Let's check out the guard station! Phoenix: Good idea. Maya: ... Oh! This is it, Nick! The \"Trailer Key\"! Phoenix: The key to that trailer in Studio Two! Maya: We'll be borrowing this, right, Nick? Trailer Key slipped into pocket. (Changed from [Trailer Key slipped into your pocket.] in the original release) Guard station (subsequent times) Phoenix: The security guard station. Ms. Oldbag must like junk food. There's a mountain of it on the desk in there. Outside Studio Two (after examining guard station in Global Studios - Main Gate) Examine Trailer door Phoenix: I wonder if the key we borrowed from the guard station will work? ... It opened. Maya: Great! Let's go, Nick! Phoenix: (She seems eager all of a sudden...) Maya: Well, you first, Nick! Phoenix: (Ah, not THAT eager.) Trailer door (subsequent times) Phoenix: The trailer door. It's unlocked. After examining trailer door in Studio Two Entrance: October 18Studio Two Trailer ???: ... Maya: Eek! S-someone's in here! ???: Names. Maya: O-our n-names? Um, w-we're WP's lawyers, and, um... ???: I see. ... Maya: A-and who might you...? Vasquez: Dee Vasquez. The producer. Phoenix: (Dee Vasquez... She's quite beautiful.) Examine Left poster Phoenix: Another old movie poster. \"'The Singing Samurai' starring Jack Hammer.\" What the hell do samurai sing about? Chopping off heads? Maya: Oh. My. God. That movie was the best! It's about a samurai who sings his way to fame and fortune! Mr. Hammer was a very accomplished singer, you know. Phoenix: Singing samurai stars... What's next? Ninja ballet? Middle poster Phoenix: \"'Samurai Summer' starring Jack Hammer.\" This poster's quite old. Maya: Wow! It's been years since I saw that show! It was one of those typical summer romance stories... but it was great! Phoenix: A typical summer romance... with a samurai on a horse? Right poster Phoenix: An old movie poster. \"'Dynamite Samurai' starring Jack Hammer.\" I guess Mr. Hammer used to be quite the star. Table Phoenix: This is where they had that meeting. There are documents and paper cups scattered around. Trash can Phoenix: Nothing in here that could be a clue. Just some paper cups and crumpled documents. Whiteboard Phoenix: It looks like they were designing a set to use for the Steel Samurai show. They've got some figures for how much the set costs... I can't believe they spend that much money on those sets! Window Phoenix: The glass is frosted. I can't see outside. This far into October, the dimming daylight makes it feel like winter's coming. Talk The day of the crime Phoenix: I was wondering if you could tell me about the day of the murder... Vasquez: ... ... Phoenix: M-Ms. Vasquez? Vasquez: Script. Phoenix: E-excuse me? Vasquez: Script. I'm looking for a script. Phoenix: A s-script? Vasquez: \"The Steel Samurai, Episode 13.\" I need it. Maya: Umm... could we ask you a bit about the day of the murder? Vasquez: I need to read it. ... Maya: ... Phoenix: ... (We're getting nowhere fast.) The Steel Samurai Maya: Um, w-we'd really like to ask you about the Steel Samurai! Vasquez: ... ... Phoenix: Ms. Vasquez? Vasquez: It's on TV. Every week. That's all I have to say about that. Maya: N-Nick! She's telling us to go watch TV!? The nerve of her! Phoenix: Hey, don't get mad at me. The director Phoenix: About the director... Sal Manella, was it? What, er, exactly is his role here...? Vasquez: Perhaps I didn't make myself clear? I'm looking for a script. I can't be bothered with anything else. ... Maya: Nick? Are all people in the entertainment business this... weird? Phoenix: It's starting to look like it. Present Anything Vasquez: I'm not interested. After clearing all Talk options: Maya: Nick, let's get out of here. Isn't there someplace else we have to check? Phoenix: Y-yeah. Vasquez: Wait. Phoenix: Y-yes? Vasquez: If you see Manella, give him this. Maya: W-why do we have to do your errands...! Vasquez: ... Maya: ... Vasquez: ... Maya: I... I don't think I like her. *sniff* Phoenix: Don't cry. She'll take it as a sign of weakness. Alright. We'll give it to him if we see him. Vasquez's Memo added to the Court Record. Dressing Room Present Vasquez's Memo Phoenix: Here. I got this from the producer... Manella: Huh? \"Bring the script for Episode 13\"? Episode 13... where did I put that one? ... I must have left it somewhere... *sweats* U-uh oh... My ass is p0wned if I don't find it... *shakes* Maya: Nick... It might be quicker to just look in all the places where he's likely to have been. Phoenix: I agree. Inside Studio One (after presenting Vasquez's Memo in Global Studios - Dressing Room) Maya: We're back at the scene of the crime. Let's find what we need and get out of here quick, Nick. Examine Director's chair Maya: Hey! Look! That's the chair the director sits in! I've always wanted to sit in one of these. Phoenix: (The director...!) Maya... Take a look around that chair for me, would you? Remember that script the director was talking about? Didn't he say he'd left it somewhere? Maya: Ahah! Found it, Nick! The script! Phoenix: Good work! Script placed in pocket. Director's chair (subsequent times) Maya: Hey! Look! That's the chair the director sits in! I've always wanted to sit in one of these. Hey Nick, take a look at that. One of those black-and-white boards they clap at the start of filming! And look! A megaphone! A real live megaphone! Phoenix: ... Maya: Ready, Nick? Action! Phoenix: (This girl is more troubled than I thought.) Dressing Room Present Script Phoenix: We found your script. Manella: W00t! THX! S-still... I dunno... That woman is to be ph34red when you bring something to her late... Say, um, j00 think j00 d00dz could take it down there for me? THX! Maya: Is that producer really that scary? Phoenix: (Well, she's certainly not NORMAL...) Trailer Talk The blocked path (appears after presenting Script) Leads to: \"On the day of the murder, the path that leads here was blocked?\" Present Script Phoenix: Here, we found it! Your script! Vasquez: Ah. Script handed to Dee Vasquez. Vasquez: ... Phoenix: ... Umm... uh... You're not going to talk to us? Vasquez: Quiet. I'm reading. Maya: ...! Just you hold on! What's the big idea!? Who do you think you are anyway!? And, and do you even know who we are!? Vasquez: ... Powers's lawyers? Maya: Umm.... right. Vasquez: Am I a suspect? Maya: N-no, it's just, well, no, but... Vasquez: ... You wanted to know about the day of the murder? Maya: Y-yes. Anything you could tell us would be a big help. Vasquez: ... You know there was a meeting here at noon? Phoenix: Yes. With the director and the people from the network... Vasquez: Correct. Now, listen closely. None of the people in this trailer that afternoon went to Studio One. It was impossible for us to leave. Maya: Impossible? Why? Vasquez: The path was blocked. Phoenix: The... path? Phoenix: On the day of the murder, the path that leads here was blocked? Vasquez: You saw Mr. Monkey on the way here, correct? Phoenix: M-\"Mr. Monkey\"? Vasquez: The monkey with the broken head. Phoenix: Oh, right, that... (What an original name...) Vasquez: Its head fell over in the wind on the day of the murder. They didn't start moving the head out of the way until after 3:00. It was after 4:00 by the time the path was unblocked. Capice? Everyone in this trailer was stuck here until the path was cleared. Stuck in this trailer. Stuck until after 4:00. Hammer died at 2:30. Thus, none of us could have gone to Studio One. Maya: W-what!? Vasquez: It's true. A crane came just after 3:00 to move the head. We called some people in to clear the way. I'm sure they'd corroborate my story. Phoenix: B-but wait! What if the head fell over after 2:30? Then you could have gone to Studio One! Vasquez: 2:30... the time of death. ... Very well. Come. Outside Studio One Vasquez: ... That's \"Mr. Monkey.\" When it wasn't broken, it announced the time... in \"ooks.\" One \"ook\" per hour. Ook ook ook ook. Always with the ooking. Phoenix: (It IS a monkey, after all.) Vasquez: Check its head. The clock inside stopped when it broke. Maya: ...! Nick, it's stopped at 2:15. Phoenix: 2:15...? Vasquez: That's right. This path was blocked from 2:15 till after 4:00. Therefore, we're innocent. Phoenix: Mr. Hammer died in Studio One at 2:30... Vasquez: See? Good bye. Mr. Monkey's Head data added to the Court Record. (Changed from [Mr. Monkey data added to the Court Record.] in the original release) Maya: What do we do, Nick? There isn't anyone besides WP who could have killed Hammer! It's over... We're finished! Phoenix: (It sure doesn't look good. Guess we should head back to the office and plan our strategy...) Examine Bench Phoenix: I really want to take a break, but we have work to do! Still, it's kind of sad to see so many empty benches... Kind of like if you threw a party, and nobody came. Left path Phoenix: This is the path that goes to Studio Two. The mascot's head fell right on the path on the day of the murder. The path was completely blocked between 2:00 and 4:00. Mr. Monkey Phoenix: I see. There's a clock and a speaker in the monkey's head. It would usually tell the time by \"ook\"ing. The clock is stopped at 2:15 now. October 18Wright & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: Now what... We're fresh out of clues. Everyone's alibi is water-tight. We don't even have any promising leads. Things are looking pretty grim. ???: It's a little early for giving up, don't you think? Phoenix: Huh? ???: You've got one lead... Phoenix: M-Mia! It's you! What took you so long!? Mia: Sorry, Phoenix. Maya has trouble calling me unless she's really in trouble. Phoenix: Right! Oh, wait. I guess that means we're really in trouble. Mia: I'd say so. Phoenix: What did you mean, we have one lead...? Mia: The boy, of course. Cody: Yeah, I saw 'em. I saw everything! Maya: What!? Cody: But...but no way am I telling you losers! Phoenix: I dunno. He didn't sound like he was going to help us at all. Mia: I'm sure you can find some way of bringing him over to your side. Either way, we should get back to the studios. That boy is our last hope, Phoenix. Phoenix: (Thanks, now I'm more worried than I was before...) Examine Houseplant Mia: My poor plant! It looks so... so sluggish! Have you been watering it properly, Phoenix? Phoenix: Um, well, Maya has actually... I think maybe she's giving it too much. Mia: That child! Sorry, Charley. Phoenix: (The plant's name is... Charley?) Movie poster Phoenix: A poster of an old movie that Mia liked. Oh, hey! Mia, what's the name of this movie? Mia: That movie...? Oh! I'd sure like to see that one again! It's, um... What was it, again? S-sorry, it's right on the tip of my tongue... Phoenix: (Let me guess... it's a suspense thriller?) Talk What to do Phoenix: So, what's the best thing to do from here? Mia: We need to get to the studio and talk to that boy. Any ideas Phoenix: So, do you have any ideas about who might have done this? Mia: We don't have enough information to make a case yet. Phoenix: (Where have I heard that phrase before? So THAT's where Maya got it from...) Present Anything Mia: Showing me that isn't going to do any good. You know what they say, \"Dead men don't tell tales.\" Phoenix: (You sure are talking enough!) October 18Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: I guess Mr. Powers is in questioning... Mia: Oh well. Let's try again another day, Phoenix. October 18Global StudiosMain Gate Oldbag: Huff... puff... huff... puff... huff... puff... huff... Huff... puff... huff... puff... huff... puff... huff... Phoenix: W-what's wrong? Oldbag: Huff... puff... huff... puff... whih... whippersnapper! Phoenix: (She's been chasing that boy this whole time.) Oldbag: Huff... puff... when... when I ca... catch him... I... huff Phoenix: (Sounds like she hasn't had any luck catching him.) Oldbag: Huff... puff... I...  I got a hostage now, whippersnapper! Phoenix: (A \"hostage\"...!?) Talk The fanboy Phoenix: Umm... what happened to the boy? Oldbag: I-if I see him a-again, I'll... huff! L-lay him flat! Huff... puff... Mia: My, what a violent old lady... The director, et al. Phoenix: Actually, I met with the director just now... Oldbag: Eh? Hah... my heart, it don't feel so good. Phoenix: (Is she okay!?) Oldbag: B-before I go, I'd like to v-visit the place where poor H-Hammer died... Phoenix: (Right... she was saying she wanted to visit the studio where he died.) The \"hostage\" Phoenix: What's this about a \"hostage\"? Oldbag: Huff... huff... W-when that boy was running away... ...he dropped this, a-and ran! Huff... huff... H-he'll come back... huff... huff... for this one! Phoenix: (It's kind of hard to understand her with all that huffing and puffing.) Mia: Phoenix! That \"hostage\" might be what we need! Cody might talk to us if we gave him that! Phoenix: (Good idea!) Ms. Oldbag! Might I... Oldbag: No! I'm catching that brat if it's the last thing I do! Mia: Phoenix. Do you have anything you might trade with her? Phoenix: (A trade, hmm... I wonder...?) Present Cardkey Oldbag: H-hey... that... huff... That's a card... huff... Studio One? Phoenix: Right. A cardkey to Studio One. Oldbag: Huff... puff... I... I could visit poor Hammer... I'd like to visit... huff... he died... whew. I was his... his fan. Phoenix: You don't have your own card, Ms. Oldbag? Oldbag: Studio One isn't my turf. Huff... huff... You'll let me borrow... borrow it, then? Phoenix: (If I give her the cardkey, then I won't be able to get into Studio One...!) Keep the cardkey Phoenix: Sorry, we have our own investigating to do there. Oldbag: Huff... huff... puff. Poo. Phoenix: (Was that last bit a breath, or a pout...?) Leads back to Court Record Lend her the cardkey Leads to: \"Why don't you let her borrow it, Phoenix?\" Powers's(?) Photo Oldbag: I... I told you who I s-saw! Huff! Huff... it... it was Powers! Phoenix: (Well, at least she's consistent...) Trailer Key Phoenix: Ms. Oldbag? I'm borrowing this... just so you know. Oldbag: Oh... o-okay... huff. J-just be sure to... huff... give it b-back... puff. Phoenix: (She's not as demanding when she's exhausted.) Anything else Oldbag: Huff... huff... puff... ... huff... puff... haaah! ... Huff.. huff... puff... huff... puff... huff... hooo! Phoenix: (She's too busy catching her breath to tell me anything!) Mia: Why don't you let her borrow it, Phoenix? Phoenix: I guess it can't hurt. Here you go, Ms. Oldbag. Cardkey lent to Ms. Oldbag. Oldbag: ... Listen to me, sonny. I don't like having debts to no whippersnappers. You take this, and we're even. Deal? Phoenix: What's this...? A Steel Samurai trading card? Oldbag: That sneaky kid dropped it! I figure it's pretty important to him, though. Phoenix: Thank you, I may have a use for this. (This must be the \"hostage\" she was talking about.) Steel Samurai Card added to the Court Record. Oldbag: Right. I'm off. Phoenix: (There she goes, hobbling off toward the studio...) Outside Studio One Examine Welcome sign Phoenix: \"Welcome\"... I wonder if the murder will make this place famous, too. Inside Studio One Examine Director's chair Phoenix: A classic director's chair. I'm surprised they don't have an extra large one for Mr. Manella. Film camera Phoenix: A collection of expensive film equipment. I can't even begin to imagine how much just one of these costs. If we broke one, we'd go bankrupt for sure. Reflecting screen Phoenix: A panel for reflecting light. They call it a \"reflecting board\" or something. Stage backdrop Phoenix: A stage backdrop. This is \"Neo Fujiyama,\" according to Maya. It looks incredibly fake, but I guess the kids don't mind. (Step)ladder Phoenix: A perfectly normal stepladder. I've never actually used one. I don't like heights. I'm a firm belever that humankind was made to keep both feet on the ground. Outside Studio Two Examine Lunch table Phoenix: Looks like two people ate here. There's nothing left on the plates. Number \"2\" sign Phoenix: There's a big \"2\" painted here. Probably because this is Studio Two? Probably... Though it doesn't look anything like a studio. Studio van Phoenix: A light van for moving staff and equipment around. They've kept it in pretty good shape. Looks like it'd run fine. Flower garden Phoenix: Nameless flowers bloom in solitude. They probably have a proper name... But it is not for me to know. Not now, nor ever till the end of my days. ... I need a vacation. Storage materials Phoenix: These look like materials for making a movie set. They've been sitting here for quite some time. This might as well be a junkyard. Trailer door Phoenix: The door is unlocked. We could probably just walk right in. Trailer Examine Left poster Phoenix: Another old movie poster. \"'The Singing Samurai' starring Jack Hammer.\" What the hell do samurai sing about? Chopping off heads? Mia: It's a samurai musical set in ancient Japan. Phoenix: A s-samurai musical? Is that even a genre!? Well, I'm impressed. You know your stuff, Mia. Mia: Oh, Maya's the real fan. I just picked a little up. Middle poster Phoenix: \"'Samurai Summer' starring Jack Hammer.\" This poster looks like it's been hanging here for years. Mia: This is one of Maya's favorite movies. Phoenix: Maybe we should replace the poster in the office with this one? Mia: That... would be kind of sad. October 18Global StudiosEmployee Area Phoenix: Hey! Hey, you! W-wait a sec! Mia: ... Phoenix... Was that the boy? Phoenix: Yeah. His name's \"Cody Hackins.\" Mia: I think he ran into the dressing room. Examine Bicycle Phoenix: Looks like one of those electric-powered bicycles. I dunno about these. I mean, what's the point? Mia: It makes it a lot easier to go up hills! Phoenix: Where have I heard that line before...? Dressing room door Phoenix: The door to the dressing room. It's not locked. Mia: This is where Cody ran... Let's go in and see if we can get him to talk. Storage room door Phoenix: That must be the storage room. That's where they keep all the film equipment. Vending machine Phoenix: Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. I was expecting some cool theme snacks, or something. Popcorn, at least! Mia: Look at this! \"Spaghetti in a Soda Can\"...? Phoenix: S-spaghetti? Wouldn't just the sauce come out and the noodles all stay stuck inside? Mia: \"Best when slammed.\" I guess they want you to drink it in one gulp...? Phoenix: Slamming spaghetti. Right... October 18Global StudiosDressing Room Phoenix: He's sure to be in here somewhere... Found you! Cody: ...! Phoenix: Dammit! He's getting away! Mia: Come back! ... There. He's back. Phoenix: (How did she...!?) Cody: ... Mia: Hey there. Would you mind helping us out? Please? Cody: ... I-I'm Cody. Mia: Hello, Cody. I'm Mia. Mia Fey. Nice to meet you. Cody: Yo. Phoenix: And I'm Phoenix Wright! Cody: Who asked? Mia: Phoenix, you can take it from here. Phoenix: (I'm not so sure I'm qualified...) Examine Cosmetics Phoenix: There's an array of cosmetics here. According to Maya, that wig was used in some old TV show... Cody: You don't know \"Samurai Boogey-Woogey\"!? You're even lamer than I thought! Phoenix: (Why does everybody but me know about this show!?) Powers's bag Phoenix: Mr. Powers's bag. Mia: Now, Phoenix, it's not polite to look through other people's belongings. Phoenix: H-hey, don't look at me! (Tell that to your sister!) Table Phoenix: There's a box of snacks on the table, and some cans of soda. They're all empty. I'm glad Maya isn't here to see this. She'd be devastated. Mia: Sorry? What was that about Maya? Phoenix: O-oh, nothing. Talk The Steel Samurai Phoenix: The Steel Samurai's so cool. I think he's the, um, the \"bomb.\" Cody: Hah! What would a lamer like you know about the Steel Samurai! Phoenix: H-hey, watch that attitude! Mia: Phoenix, you really should't yell like that. He's only a kid. Cody: Yeah! Don't yell like that I'm only a kid! What happened Phoenix: So, do you know anything about what happened here? Could you tell me, please? Cody: I don't know nothing! Phoenix: (Hmm... looks like a little persuasion's necessary. Maybe a bribe...?) Present Powers's(?) Photo Cody: Hey, it's the Steel Samurai. Huh? Why's he dragging his foot like that? Where'd you get this, anyway? Samurai Spear Cody: The Samurai Spear! That's totally cool. I wish I had one, too... Phoenix: (This kid and Maya would get along great.) Steel Samurai Card Phoenix: Cody... This look familiar? Cody: Hey! My UR! Phoenix: \"You are\"... huh? Cody: \"U.R.\" You know, \"ultra rare\"! That card's really hard to get! Man, for a grown-up, you sure are dumb! Phoenix: I'll give you this... IF you help me. Cody: But that's my card! By offering me something I already own, you're in effect eschewing the very basis of our consumer society, namely the principle of fair trade! Man, for a grown-up, you sure are dumb! Phoenix: (W-what do they teach these kids in school these days!? Quantum physics!?) Cody: Whatever, I don't need that card. Phoenix: Huh? Cody: I got a double. Just keep it. It's yours. Phoenix: (What!? After I went through all that trouble...) Cody: If you want to trade, find me a REALLY rare card! Phoenix: \"Really rare\"!? You mean there's something rarer than \"Ultra Rare\"!? Cody: Ultra Rare Premium cards are way rarer than plain Ultra Rare cards! Come ON! Man, for a grown-up, you sure are dumb! Phoenix: Premium... rare... why do I feel like we're talking about steaks? Anything else Cody: What's that? Bo-ring! Man, how can one person be so lame!? If you were a superhero you'd be Lame-o-man! After clearing \"The blocked path\" Talk option in Studio Two Trailer, then revisiting Wright & Co. Law Offices, then presenting Steel Samurai Card in Global Studios - Dressing Room: October 18Studio Two Trailer Penny: Oh, hi. Phoenix: Hello. What brings you here? Penny: Oh, well, I had to arrange some stuff... Umm... Phoenix: Yes? Penny: The, um, girl with you. Doesn't she seem a little different? Like, is she even the same person as before? Phoenix: Um, nope! She's the same as always. Mia: Same as always. Penny: Okay... whatever you say... Talk The fanboy Phoenix: Have you seen that boy since then? Penny: Nope. You missed it, though. The security lady was chasing around after the boy so fast I thought she'd collapse. Of course, he got away in the end. Boy, was she mad! Phoenix: Actually, we saw them. How's the old windbag doing? Penny: She was squeezing donuts through her clenched fists back at the guard station. Phoenix: (Some people take their jobs a little too seriously.) Mr. Hammer Phoenix: Are all the posters on the wall here of Hammer? Penny: Yes. It's really a terrible loss for the studios. Phoenix: But... his popularity had been waning recently, right? Penny: That's true. Then again, after what happened... Phoenix: After WHAT happened? Penny: Y-you mean, you don't know about Hammer...? Phoenix: No, what? Penny: I-I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said anything. What happened (appears after \"Mr. Hammer\") Phoenix: Wait, now you have to tell me. What happened with Hammer? Penny: I-I'm sorry. I'm probably not the one who should tell you. Phoenix: (Uh oh. Why do I get the feeling something's being covered up here?) Present Steel Samurai Card Leads to: \"Do you know anything about this?\" Anything else Penny: Umm... Sorry. I'm really Not sure what that is. Phoenix: Do you know anything about this? Penny: Hey, that's a Steel Samurai trading card. I collect those, actually. I'm one card away from a complete set! Phoenix: A complete set? Penny: Yeah, a set of one of each card. Phoenix: Huh... Penny: ... Wait...Waitwaitwaitwait!!! That's it!!! That's the card I need! You don't know how long I've been looking for it! Phoenix: Uh... Penny: I don't care what kind of girl you might think I am, I need that card! P-please! I beg you! Please trade with me! Phoenix: T-trade with you? Penny: Yes, trade cards! Look, I'll even trade you an Ultra Rare Premium card! Phoenix: Trade me a... huh? Penny: Yes, it's a good deal for your Ultra Rare! Please!!! Mia: Phoenix! Can't you see she's desperate? Phoenix: (W-what's everybody getting so excited about...?) Trade Phoenix: Okay. Leads to: \"Really!? Th-thanks!!!\" Don't trade Phoenix: No... no, I can't. See, this card isn't really even mine. Penny: !!! I... I see. O-of course. Of course it wouldn't be yours. Of course you couldn't trade it with me. Of course I won't ever get that card, ever. Of course I don't even really deserve that card. Mia: Phoenix, do something! She's blacking out! Phoenix: O-o-okay, okay! I'll trade! Leads to: \"Really!? Th-thanks!!!\" Penny: Really!? Th-thanks!!! Then this is for you. URP Card added to the Court Record. Penny: Yaa-hoo! Phoenix: (And there she goes...) Mia: Doesn't doing good things like that make you feel great? Phoenix: Yeah. Yeah, it does. Dressing Room Present URP Card Leads to: \"See this card?\" Phoenix: See this card? Cody: Yeah, so... Wait! That's it!!! That's the last Ultra Rare Premium card I need! C'mon give it to me, please! You gotta give it to me! Phoenix: (Wow, I've never seen him so... eager.) R-right! Okay! How about a trade? Cody: You're on! I'll give you a \"Samurai Spear\" and throw in an \"Evil Magistrate\" to boot!! Phoenix: No no no no... not that kind of trade. I don't want cards. I want information. Cody: Huh? You sure? Fine by me! URP Card given to Cody. (Changed from [Gave URP Card to Cody.] in the original release) Mia: Okay, Phoenix. Let's hear what he has to say. If he knows something that could help us, we can have him take the stand tomorrow. Talk The Steel Samurai Phoenix: So... you like the Steel Samurai. Cody: He's so cool! Phoenix: I... I guess. Cody: You're judging him by his looks! You have to look at his actions, at his life! Phoenix: (I'm being lectured on life by a grade schooler...) Cody: You like him too, don'tcha? Phoenix: Uh... Oh, me? Y-yeah! I, um, love the Steel Samurai. Cody: So, tell me what your favorite thing about the Steel Samurai is! His kind nature Phoenix: R-right... (C'mon, think of something!) I really like his, um, his kind nature. What a guy! Cody: Totally! He looks so tough, but inside, he's as gentle as a kitten! Phoenix: Yeah... Cody: So, what else do you like about him? Phoenix: (Don't tell me I have to keep this act up...) Leads back to: \"So, tell me what your favorite thing about the Steel Samurai is!\" His fighting skills Leads to: \"Got to think of something...\" Will Powers's acting Phoenix: W-well... (I've never even seen a full episode of that dumb show.) A-actually, I'm kind of a fan of Will Powers... Cody: Whoa! That's totally hard-core! Phoenix: (You're calling ME hard-core?) Cody: So, what else do you like about him? Phoenix: (Don't tell me I have to keep this act up...) Leads back to: \"So, tell me what your favorite thing about the Steel Samurai is!\" Phoenix: (Got to think of something...) I like it when he, uh, he vanquishes his foes! Cody: Yeah! Whizzam! The Steel Samurai always wins! Always! Check this out! It's my fan album! Phoenix: What the...? It's all pictures of the Steel Samurai. Cody: I go to every live performance! Phoenix: (Those stupid publicity stunts where they beat each other up in public...?) Cody: I always take a picture when the Steel Samurai lands the final blow! Whizzam! I got 'em all! I never missed one! A perfect collection! Check it out! My new digital camera! Mia: Wow, that's very impressive. The newest model, isn't it? Cody: You bet, lady! I just got it for my birthday. My album has a name, wanna hear it? \"The Steel Samurai: Path To Glory.\" The Steel Samurai always wins! Always! Hey, if you want this, you can have it, lady. Mia: Really? Are you sure? Cody: Yeah, I took these with a digital camera. I got all the data at home so I can always make another one. Mia: Well, then I'm happy to accept! Thank you. \"Path to Glory\" received. Phoenix: (What's with people always giving stuff to Mia? What a life!) Mia: ? The Steel Samurai (subsequent times) Phoenix: So... you like the Steel Samurai. Cody: Well, yeah! Duh! He's so strong! Phoenix: I... I guess. Cody: You're judging him by his looks! You have to look at his actions, at his life! Phoenix: (I'm being lectured on life by a grade schooler...) What happened Phoenix: You were here on the day of the... incident, right? Cody: Yeah... Phoenix: Did you see anything unusual? Cody: ... Mia: Cody. Cody: ! Mia: Cody, he needs to know because he's fighting for justice. Isn't that the Steel Samurai's motto? \"For great justice\"? You have to help us fight for great justice, too. Cody: I... I saw... I saw everything! Phoenix: (Well, well... We might get some useful information out of him yet.) What you saw (appears after \"The Steel Samurai\" and \"What happened\") Leads to: \"Cody... I need to ask you something very important.\" Present \"Path to Glory\" Phoenix: Thanks for this. Cody: Hey, I gave that to the nice lady, not you, loser! No looking at that, okay! Phoenix: (Believe me, I wasn't going to...) Phoenix: Cody... I need to ask you something very important. What did you see on the day of the incident? Cody: ... I got here that day around 2:00... I had to come in through the woods out back so that old lady wouldn't see me. I got kinda lost, though. I was in there for maybe a half hour or so. Then I finally got to the studio. After that... Mia: What is it, Cody? Cody: Th-the Steel Samurai killed the bad guy! He used his Samurai Spear! Just like always! One shot, one kill! It happened so fast... I got scared. I went home after that. Phoenix: I... I see. It must have been hard for you. Cody: Man, you say those nice things but it's so obvious you aren't speaking from the heart. Phoenix: (Umm... right.) Mia? Mia: Yes? Phoenix: I think we can say for sure this means the Steel Samurai did it. Mia: True enough. Phoenix: And the director has an alibi, so it wasn't him. Mia: Indeed. Phoenix: So... the only person left who it could have been is Will Powers! Mia: ... I have to admit, it's kind of a shock. But if you put this boy on the witness stand, your client will be \"guilty\" for sure. Phoenix: Let's not call him then... Mia: I think that would be wise. Best to leave this one alone. ???: Not so fast, pal! Gumshoe: I heard everything! This boy here's a key witness! And he's under police protection, starting now! C'mon, son. You've got a rendezvous with me down at the precinct! Cody: No! I ain't going! Waah! Mia: ... That didn't go so well. We're back to zero leads. And now we have a serious handicap in court. Phoenix: W-what're we going to do, Mia! Mia: Well, hmm... I... really need to be going. Don't worry, Phoenix. I'm sure you'll be fine! Phoenix: Whoa whoa whoa! C-come to the trial tomorrow, please! I need you there! Mia: Phoenix, can I ask you something? Do you really believe that Mr. Powers is innocent? I believe Phoenix: Of course he is! Mia: ... That's all I wanted to hear. Excellent. I'll see you in court, then. Leads to: \"Great! Thanks, Mia!\" I don't know Phoenix: (I never expected things to go this badly for Powers's case... I'm not sure we can win this one.) Mia: Phoenix? If you don't believe him, who will!? Phoenix: (Uh oh, she's mad.) Mia: Oh well... I'll see you in court tomorrow then. Leads to: \"Great! Thanks, Mia!\" Phoenix: Great! Thanks, Mia! Mia: See you soon. To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here. Turnabout Samurai Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 Part 5 Part 6 October 19, 9:42 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1 Will: ... ... Umm... Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yes? Will: Why do you look so... unhappy? Phoenix: O-oh! Oh, nothing! Eh heh heh. Really, it's nothing. Right, Mia? (Uh oh. She looks even unhappier...) Mia: Phoenix. Your client is now practically a dead man walking... Perhaps that's why I feel particularly close to him. Phoenix: This is no time for dead-people jokes, please. Mia: You know we're going into this trial utterly defenseless. Yet, if Mr. Powers is truly innocent... We should be able to find something overlooked in the evidence to prove it. Phoenix: Something \"overlooked\"...? Mia: We have to find something, Phoenix, today. It's that, or lose the trial. Phoenix: (This isn't going to be easy.) October 19, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4 Judge: The court is now in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers. Edgeworth: The prosecution is ready, Your Honor. Phoenix: The defense is ready, Your Honor. Judge: Very well. Mr. Edgeworth, your opening statement, please. Edgeworth: An unexpected fact has come to the attention of the court. Yesterday, we learned that there were other people present at the studios. Today, I would like to show evidence proving they had nothing to do with the murder. Judge: Very well. You may call your first witness, Mr. Edgeworth. Phoenix: (I wonder if it'll be that producer...) (Changed from [I wonder if that producer is going to come out...] in the original release) Edgeworth: The prosecution calls Mr. Sal Manella to the stand. Phoenix: (...or that director.) Edgeworth: Will the witness state his name and profession? Manella: ... How r00d can j00 get! J00 don't know ME!? I'm the director! I make the Steel Samurai, n00b! ROFL! Edgeworth: ... Manella: S... Sal Manella. I'm a director. Television. Judge: Were you at Global Studios on the day of the murder? Manella: Y-yes, Your Honor. Judge: Hmm... Very well. Please testify to the court about the events of that day. Mia: Phoenix. Let's start by picking this testimony apart. If Powers is innocent, you know what that means. Someone in the trailer on that day did it! Phoenix: R-right. (She doesn't waste any time putting on the pressure!) Witness Testimony -- The Day of the Murder -- Manella: I was at the studios from around 9:00 that morning. During the morning, I was doing... umm... an action scene run-through. It took a lot more time than I thought it would. I hear that everyone else ate lunch in the Employee Area... But I had a meeting in the Studio Two trailer, so I ended up skipping lunch. We were in the meeting until around 4:00... During the meeting, well, I'm pretty sure no one left their chairs. That's about it. Judge: Hmm... The time of Mr. Hammer's death was 2:30 PM. And according to your testimony, you were in a meeting at that time. Mr. Wright, you may begin your cross-examination. Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. Cross Examination -- The Day of the Murder -- Manella: I was at the studios from around 9:00 that morning. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Is that when you always come in to work? Manella: Oh, oh no. I come in all sort of hours. It's the \"industry\" way. Phoenix: (Yeah, I know all about the freaks in your \"industry\"...) Manella: Still, FWIW, I was pretty busy all that day.\u00a0:( Edgeworth: Tell us more about that. Manella: During the morning, I was doing... umm... an action scene run-through. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: In the Employee Area? Manella: That's right. It was a fight scene between the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate. Phoenix: Was anyone else at the run-through? Manella: Oh, yeah. That security lady was sitting there watching the whole thing. LOL. She was cheering on Hammer, if you can believe it. Phoenix: (She certainly has the lungs for it...) Anyone else? Manella: Nope, just us four. Manella: It took a lot more time than I thought it would. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why did it go on so long? Manella: Um, I'm pretty sure j00've already heard about this... But WP twisted his ankle during the run-through, see... Phoenix: (Oh, right, thus the limp.) Manella: Which of course led to me missing my lunch. ROFS! Phoenix: (ROFS? Rolling on the Floor... Starving?) Manella: I hear that everyone else ate lunch in the Employee Area... Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What exactly did they have for lunch? Manella: T-bone steak! The assistant cooked some up. Phoenix: (Come to think of it, there was a plate with some bones on it in the Employee Area.) Edgeworth: \"Everyone else\" meaning that the witness did not eat with them. Manella: But I had a meeting in the Studio Two trailer, so I ended up skipping lunch. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, in the end, you didn't get to eat? Manella: Yeah. No steak, at least! Can j00 believe it? Phoenix: That must have been tough. Mia: Phoenix. Phoenix: Yeah? Mia: Doesn't something about that seem odd to you? Not at all Phoenix: Well, no, not really. Seems pretty straightforward. Mia: Oh. Perhaps I was wrong, then. Leads back to cross-examination It's a little vague Phoenix: Actually, there is something bothering me. Mr. Manella, just now you said \"steak, at least.\" So you ate something other than steak? Manella: Yeah, good call! I had some chocolate in my pocket, which I used to stave off starvation! Phoenix: I see... (Is that all? I was sure I was on to something there.) Leads back to cross-examination It's contradictory Phoenix: Yeah, it does seem odd, now that you mention it. Mr. Manella! Manella: H-hmm? W-what do j00 mean? *sweats* Phoenix: When I went to Studio Two, I saw something on the table there. (Changed from [When I went to that trailer, I saw something on the table.] in the original release) There were two plates--the same kind of plates as the ones in the Employee Area. (Changed from [There were two plates on the table--the same kind of plates as in the Employee Area.] in the original release) Who ate lunch there? Manella: M-mmpf! No, er, ah, um, eh heh. Good call! *sweats* I, er, I was embarrassed so I didn't mention it... But I did eat, after all. Phoenix: A t-bone steak, you mean? Manella: Yeah, well, I mean the assistant went through all that trouble... I brought it to the trailer thinking I could eat it later. Phoenix: (Clearly a man who likes to eat. I'd suspected as much...) So, when exactly did you eat it? Manella: We took one break during that meeting. I, er, wolfed it down then. *drool* Phoenix: (A mental image I will carry with me to my grave... Wait a second...! If they took a break in that meeting, that contradicts his testimony! I'll press on that one a bit more...) Leads back to cross-examination Manella: We were in the meeting until around 4:00... Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What were you discussing? Manella: The Steel Samurai story, and our budget. Get this! The sponsors turn to me and say, \"Mr. Manella. Those scripts of yours are not appropriate for children.\" Can j00 believe it!? Phoenix: (Actually, I kind of can.) So, nobody left the table during the whole meeting? Manella: During the meeting, well, I'm pretty sure no one left their chairs. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You didn't take a single break? Manella: Er... well... Y-yeah! Not a one! *sweats* Phoenix: (Hmm... what's he sweating so much about, I wonder? If only I had an idea... I'll wait for one to come up and hit him with it later.) Press (after selecting \"It's contradictory\" upon pressing fifth statement) Phoenix: Phoenix: You didn't take a single break? Manella: Er... well... Y-yeah! Not a one! *sweats* Phoenix: (Hmm... what's he sweating so much about, I wonder? If only I had an idea... Wait a second... Maybe I do have an idea!) Press harder Leads to: \"Wait a second!\" Leave him be Phoenix: (No, on second thought, I'm drawing a blank. If I press too hard in the wrong place, I'll just end up scaring him into silence. Maybe I'll just sit back and see what happens.) Leads back to cross-examination Mia: Phoenix. If his alibi holds, Powers is finished. Press him as hard as you can and find out where he's lying! Phoenix: R-right! Phoenix: Wait a second! Mr. Manella, you've just contradicted yourself! Didn't you just tell the court that you ate that t-bone steak during a break? Manella: Oops! ROFL! Phoenix: Well? Manella: Umm... Judge: Mr. Manella, what's this all about? Manella: W-well, yeah, I guess we did take a little break. Mia: Phoenix! Great job! If they took a break, one of them could have gone to the studio during that time! Phoenix: Your Honor! I call on the witness to testify to the court about this break! Judge: Very well. Mr. Manella, your testimony, please. Manella: Urk! Edgeworth: Heh heh heh... Phoenix: (Uh oh. Edgeworth is laughing...) Witness Testimony -- The Break -- Manella: Yeah, FWIW, we took a break... ROFL! But it was only 15 minutes! 15! That's only 13 in Base 12! Not enough time for someone to, say, commit murder in Studio One! LOL! That's only just enough time to eat a t-bone steak, if you ask me! *steams* Judge: Hmm... I don't think it would even be enough time for that, but that's just me. Very well. You may begin the cross-examination. Cross Examination -- The Break -- Manella: Yeah, FWIW, we took a break... ROFL! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What time exactly did you take this break? Manella: Hmm... I'd say it was from around 2:30 or so until 2:45. Phoenix: (2:30!!! That's the time of death! So he could have gone to Studio One, killed Hammer, and come back... I guess it's possible, time-wise...) Edgeworth: ... Manella: But it was only 15 minutes! 15! That's only 13 in Base 12! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What were you doing for those 15 minutes? Manella: Eating my t-bone steak! What else!? Phoenix: There were two plates on the trailer table...? Manella: Oh, right. The other one was Diva's... sorry, Dee Vasquez's plate. Phoenix: (Dee Vasquez... the producer.) Edgeworth: To eat a t-bone steak in 15 minutes... that's quite a feat. Manella: Not enough time for someone to, say, commit murder in Studio One! LOL! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why is that? Press (after pressing first statement) Phoenix: Leads to: \"Why is that?\" Manella: That's only just enough time to eat a t-bone steak, if you ask me! *steams* Press Phoenix: Phoenix: I have to say, you look like a guy who gets through his meals pretty fast. Manella: Well, I was facing a cold, slightly chewy t-bone steak... Even I have to take my time eating that kind of food. LOL Mia: Well, Phoenix? Phoenix: That testimony was too short to wring any kind of useful information out of! Mia: All you have to do is prove that he was able to go to Studio One in that time! Phoenix: (Oh, great. Is that all...) Phoenix: Why is that? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Haven't we had enough of this pointless line of questioning? Your Honor! The testimony to this point has made one certain fact painfully clear: The people in the trailer had nothing to do with this murder! It was impossible for any of them to go to Studio One! Phoenix: What!? Edgeworth: Something wrong, Mr. Wright? Surely you aren't suggesting one of the people in the trailer went to Studio One! Judge: Hmm... Well, Mr. Wright? Mia: Phoenix, this is critical! Think about it before you give your answer! Judge: Do you claim someone from the trailer went to Studio One? I claim it, and claim it loud Phoenix: (If I agree to let everyone in that trailer off the hook then the trial is over... Mr. Powers will be found guilty for sure!) The victim was murdered at 2:30, the exact time of the break in the meeting. With 15 minutes, murder is certainly a possibility! Judge: Hmm... I suppose you might say that... Phoenix: (Alright, I've got the judge thinking now!) Edgeworth: Tsk, tsk, tsk... Never a dull moment with you, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: What's your point, Edgeworth! Edgeworth: You've been doing your homework, haven't you? Look at the Court Record. Phoenix: The Court Record...? Edgeworth: Surely, you knew that from 2:15 to 4:00 the path between the studios was blocked? Mrs. Monkey's head had fallen across the path! Phoenix: Whoa! You're right! Edgeworth: True, the break in the trailer meeting came right at the time of death... However! The path from there to the scene of the crime was blocked! The fallen Mrs. Monkey head barred the way! Phoenix: ... (It's actually \"Mr. Monkey,\" but Edgeworth has a point... And somehow, I feel no desire to correct him.) Judge: No counter-argument, Mr. Wright? Then I'm afraid you lose this round. Leads to: \"I believe we have seen enough evidence.\" No, it's impossible. Phoenix: (I don't want to write off so many possible suspects... But I can't keep claiming the impossible, either...) I agree that it was impossible for anyone in the trailer to go to the studio in that time. Edgeworth: Ha hah! I thought you might be thoughtlessly treading on thin ice again! But I see you had at least an inkling of the truth. Judge: What do you mean, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: It's quite simple... True, the break in the trailer meeting came right at the time of death... However! The path from there to the scene of the crime was blocked! The fallen Mrs. Monkey head barred the way! At around 2:15, a strong gust of wind knocked off the studio mascot's head. Ergo! When the people in the trailer took a break at 2:30, the way to the studio was blocked. Blocked... by Mrs. Monkey's severed head! Phoenix: ... (It's actually \"Mr. Monkey,\" but Edgeworth has a point... And somehow, I feel no desire to correct him.) Leads to: \"I believe we have seen enough evidence.\" Edgeworth: I believe we have seen enough evidence. I would like to relieve Mr. Manella from the stand. Phoenix: (Wh-what? It's over?) Judge: Very well. The court's opinion on this case is as follows: We have found that there were several other people in Studio 2 on the day of the murder. However, it is also clear that none of these people could have gone to Studio One. They therefore have no relation to this case. Furthermore, with regards to the photo of the Steel Samurai... Given the size of the costume, no one other than Mr. Powers could have worn it that day. All that is lacking is decisive evidence that he is the one who did it. If we had that, I'm afraid I would have to find Mr. Powers guilty. Edgeworth: Your Honor. The prosecution is pleased to announce that we indeed have decisive evidence: a witness. Judge: Who is this witness, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: My witness saw the very moment when the Steel Samurai skewered the victim! Judge: Order! I will have order! I see. The court will take a 10 minute recess, after which we will hear your witness. Court is adjourned for recess! October 19, 11:04 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1 Mia: ... Phoenix: What do we do now, Mia? If everyone in that trailer has an alibi... Mia: ... I'm sorry, Phoenix. I guess I was wrong. Phoenix: M-Mia! Don't tell me you're giving up! If you give up, what hope do I have...? Mia: ... Don't get me wrong. I've never given up on a trial before, not while there was a chance. Only one thing became clear in your cross-examination. The people in the trailer could not have gone to Studio One. I thought there was more to it than that... But I was wrong. That's all there is. Will: Umm... Er... What's going to happen to me? It kinda seems like everyone in that courtroom thinks I did it... They think I'm a murderer! Mia: Don't worry, Mr. Powers. If you are innocent, we will prove it. I guarantee it. Leave it to us, and... be yourself. Be strong. You are the Steel Samurai, hero to children everywhere, after all. Will: I... You... Thanks. *sniff* Mia: Okay, Phoenix. This one's for the kids! Let's do it! October 19, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4 Judge: Court is back in session for the trial of Mr. Will Powers. Edgeworth: The prosecution has a concern. As our witness is a grade schooler of tender years, and this is a murder case... we worry that the defense might cause unnecessary trauma with his cruel questioning. (Changed from [We worry that the defense might cause unnecessary trauma with his cruel questioning!] in the original release) Phoenix: (Nice to see Edgeworth taking the moral high ground...) Edgeworth: However, we have no choice. The prosecution calls Cody Hackins to the stand. Edgeworth: Your Honor. Perhaps you could arrange a box for him to stand on? Judge: Oh, r-right. Guard, please bring him a box. One of those donut crates should do. Edgeworth: Will the witness state his name and grade in school. Cody: ... Edgeworth: Witness! Cody: What!? Just 'cause you're all grown-up don't mean you can push me around! Edgeworth: Mrph... Mia: Cody? Answer his question, okay? Cody: H-hey, it's you! The nice lady! I'm Cody Hackins. I'm in 2nd grade! Phoenix: (I get the feeling this is going to be a long, long day...) Judge: Mr. Edgeworth. Please remember that you're speaking to a child. Try to be gentle. Edgeworth: M-mrrrrph! Witness! Er, I mean, Cody. Phoenix: (He's having trouble with this \"gentle\" thing.) Edgeworth: You were present, er, you were at Global Studios on the day of the, er, incident? Cody: You got a problem with that!? Edgeworth: Please tell us what you saw that day. Cody: What, pops? You want me to tell you and gramps with the beard over there? Edgeworth: Just.. Mr. Edgeworth will be fine. Judge: I prefer \"bearded gentleman\" myself. Phoenix: (A very long day...) Judge: Incidentally, photographic equipment is strictly forbidden in this courtroom. Edgeworth: M-mpht! M-my apologies, Your Honor. He said he wouldn't testify if he couldn't bring it... I'd like special permission, if that's possible. Phoenix: Wait, so you're saying you had to bargain terms with a kid... and you LOST? Cody: Hey! I just got this new camera! Don't really know how to use it all that good yet! But I bring it with me wherever I go! Mia: Phoenix. I wonder if he had that camera on the day of the murder... You'd better make a note of it in the Court Record. Cody's Camera added to the Court Record. Judge: Very well, Cody. Please testify to the court about what you saw the day of the incident. Witness Testimony -- Witness's Account -- Cody: I wanted to see a Steel Samurai rehearsal, just once. I found a map on the Internet, and went to the studios that day. I went through the woods off the path, so that old lady wouldn't catch me. I was going for the studio. I got kinda lost on the way, though. For about 30 minutes. When I came out by the studio, there was the Steel Samurai! It totally rocked! Right before my eyes, out came the bad guy! Of course, the Steel Samurai took him down! Pow! If I had my camera with me, that woulda been the time for a shot, I tell you. Anyway, I couldn't get into the studio, so I went home. Judge: Hmm... Very well. The defense may begin its cross-examination. But be gentle. Remember you're talking to a child. (Changed from [And, be gentle. Remember you're talking to a child.] in the original release) Cody: ... Phoenix: (This kid is tougher than most adults we see in here, honestly...) Cross Examination -- Witness's Account -- Cody: I wanted to see a Steel Samurai rehearsal, just once. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You really like the Steel Samurai, huh? Cody: Course I do! I've taped every show! And I go to all the live performances! Phoenix: That's impressive. Have you been to the amusement park? Cody: Course! Duh! My Dad always takes me! Phoenix: (Poor, poor Dad...) Cody: I found a map on the Internet, and went to the studios that day. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Was that day the first time you'd been to the studio? Cody: Uh, actually I've been a couple of times. I never manage to get there on a rehearsal day! And that security lady's always yelling... Edgeworth: Right, right. Please continue. Cody: Chill, pops! I'm getting to it! How am I supposed to talk with you cuttin' me off all the time? Geez! Edgeworth: ... Cody: I went through the woods, off the path, so that old lady wouldn't catch me. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Off the path\"...? Cody: Yeah, you know how the studios are in a valley there? If you go off the path a little, there's woods. That's where I was! Phoenix: I see. Cody: Anyhow... Cody: I was going for the studio. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Did nothing unusual happen on your way to the studio? Cody: \"Unusual\"? Phoenix: Did you see this monkey by any chance? Cody: Oh, you mean Mr. Monkey? Yeah I saw him, but his head wasn't busted! Edgeworth: So you went straight to the studio? Cody: I got kinda lost on the way, though. For about 30 minutes. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You got lost in the woods? Cody: Yeah. I couldn't figure out which way I was walking. Man, was I relieved when I saw the blue studio doors. But guess what happened next! Cody: When I came out by the studio, there was the Steel Samurai! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The Steel Samurai? Cody: Yeah, he was standing by the studio gate. It looked like he was thinking about something before going in. Then he opened up the gate and went inside. Phoenix: I see. What then? Cody: It totally rocked! Right before my eyes, out came the bad guy! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What sort of \"bad guy\" was it? Cody: A guy. A person. Kinda tall. Skinny. Phoenix: Are you sure it was a guy? Cody: ... I dunno. He was kinda far away. Phoenix: (Huh, he's being awfully vague...) Mia: ... Cody: Of course, the Steel Samurai took him down! Pow! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What happened to the bad guy? Cody: Huh? Well... Well, he kinda didn't move. Not a bit. Like he was dead. I-I guess he's a real pro! What a great actor! Phoenix: Y-yes, I suppose he was. Cody: If I had my camera with me, that woulda been the time for a shot, I tell you. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"If\" you had your camera? You mean, you weren't carrying your camera then? Cody: N-no, I wasn't. I-it's not like I have it all the time! Phoenix: (Really...?) Present Cody's Camera Phoenix: Leads to: \"Cody, what you just said seems, well, a little strange.\" Phoenix: (I guess seeing the killing freaked him out and he went home...) Mia: Phoenix. Remember, he's a child. Use gentle words... but be firm. Phoenix: (Easy for you to say...) Phoenix: Cody, what you just said seems, well, a little strange. Didn't you say before that you always bring your digital camera wherever you go? You were quite clear about that. Cody: Huh!? Phoenix: Cody, you shouldn't lie here. You understand that, right? Judge: Mr. Wright! A word with you... Phoenix: (Uh oh... was I putting the pressure on too much?) Judge: What is this \"digital\" camera contraption you're talking about? Phoenix: It's umm... a digital camera, Your Honor. It's kind of a new sort of camera. (How do I explain that!?) Judge: I see. Phoenix: Anyway, Cody... I can't believe you wouldn't bring your camera on a trip to the studios! You did bring it, didn't you? Cody: Umm... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Mr. Wright! How cruel you are, to terrorize a poor child so! Phoenix: I don't care if he's a child or a prosecuting attorney! No one should lie in court! Edgeworth: What do you mean \"or a prosecuting attorney\"!? Phoenix: Well, Cody? Cody: Wh-what! Yeah, so I had my camera. So what!? You got a problem with that!? Judge: So, you did have a camera? And did you use this camera? Cody: W-why would I use it? I... I was too busy watching. Judge: Hmm... Very well. Please testify to the court about what you were so busy watching. Witness Testimony -- What I Saw -- Cody: Y-yeah, I had my camera with me. But I was glued to the action! I couldn't take my eyes off it! The Steel Samurai, he goes for the bad guy... wham! Then... then the bad guy stopped moving! He's so strong! The Steel Samurai rules! Judge: Hmm... Ah? Is that all? Well, that was brief. Mr. Wright, your cross-examination. Cross Examination -- What I Saw -- Cody: Y-yeah, I had my camera with me. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, why didn't you use it? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: He's getting to that! Relax and listen. Cody: Umm... I didn't use it 'cause I was too busy watching the real thing! Cody: But I was glued to the action! I couldn't take my eyes off it! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you were watching the Steel Samurai. Did you watch the whole fight? Cody: Y-yeah, of course! Phoenix: You didn't turn away, not even once? Cody: N... no! Phoenix: Okay, then tell us exactly what happened. Cody: Y-yeah! I'm getting to that! Cody: The Steel Samurai, he goes for the bad guy... wham! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So the bad guy attacked him first? Cody: Yeah! Phoenix: What sort of person was this \"bad guy\"? Cody: I told you, a person. He was a person. Phoenix: How was he dressed? Cody: ... I kinda don't remember. I was too busy watching the Steel Samurai! Edgeworth: I see. And what happened next? Cody: Then... then the bad guy stopped moving! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why? Cody: Huh? Whaddya mean, \"why\"? Phoenix: Why wasn't the bad guy moving? Cody: W-well 'cause the Steel Samurai brought him to justice! Phoenix: And how exactly did he do that? Cody: H-how did he do it? With a Samurai Kick! And a Samurai Punch! Samurai Chop! ... Samurai Slap! S-something like that. Phoenix: (He's still being vague about this...) Cody: What! Don't gimme that look, pops! Phoenix: (How should I play this?) Wait and see what happens Phoenix: (Yeah... If I press too hard now, the judge might keep me from continuing. I'll sit back and see how the rest of this goes.) Leads back to cross-examination Press him harder Leads to: \"Cody.\" Cody: He's so strong! The Steel Samurai rules! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What did you do after the bad guy fell, Cody? Cody: ... Um, actually... The fight was so... so intense that I got kinda scared. So I went straight home. Phoenix: (Something isn't adding up here...) Phoenix: (Something about his account doesn't seem right...) Mia: Phoenix. It doesn't seem right because he's being deliberately vague! Press him on the facts, Phoenix! Find out what he saw! Phoenix: Cody. Cody: Wh-what!? Phoenix: Something's bothering me. Before you said that you \"couldn't take your eyes off\" the action. Cody: Y-yeah? So what? Phoenix: Yet you missed the most important part! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What is the meaning of this? The witness has stated what he saw quite clearly... Phoenix: Phoenix: You know as well as I do that he's being vague! Tell me, what kind of murderer uses a \"Samurai Slap\"!? Edgeworth: M-mmph! Phoenix: My point is this: Cody, you may have seen some of the Steel Samurai's fight... But you missed the most important part: the killing blow! Judge: Order! Order! Mr. Wright! How could this be? Can you explain how he might have missed something so vital? Phoenix: Um, well... er, that's the thing... Mia: Phoenix! I believe you're on the right track with this! Think: why didn't Cody see the climax of the fight? I know you! You can figure this out! Judge: Mr. Wright, your answer! We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai... Why wouldn't he watch the climax of the fight? He couldn't watch it Phoenix: Because he couldn't watch it! How could he calmly watch a murder taking place at his age! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Just a moment, please... One thing has become quite clear in this boy's testimony. He did not believe he was witnessing a murder! He was watching the Steel Samurai fight, like on TV. The more real the fight, the more he would have watched! Phoenix: Umm... huh. Judge: I have to agree with Mr. Edgeworth. Well, Mr. Wright. Do you have another explanation? Leads back to: \"We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai...\" He was watching something else Phoenix: He missed the climax of the fight... because he was looking at something else! Probably! Edgeworth: \"Probably\"? Judge: \"Something else\"? Edgeworth: Mr. Wright, explain yourself! What could possibly distract this boy from seeing his idol, the Steel Samurai, fight!? What do you claim he was looking at? Phoenix: O-ooof! (C'mon, think of something... think of something... Nothing.) Judge: Mr. Wright! Please refrain from making baseless claims! Phoenix: Y-yes... Sorry, Your Honor. Judge: Do you have another explanation for this? Leads back to: \"We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai...\" Show evidence Phoenix: Your Honor, I have evidence. Judge: \"Evidence\"...? Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. Why did Cody look away from the fight? Present Cody's Camera Phoenix: Leads to: \"Here's my proof!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Here's my proof! Judge: Proof? Phoenix: Um, uh... Can I... do that again? (This doesn't prove anything...!) Edgeworth: Hah! Lost your nerve, have you? Judge: Very well... I'll ask you the question again. Leads back to: \"We have ascertained that this young boy is a great fan of the Steel Samurai...\" Phoenix: Here's my proof! Judge: What's that? The camera...? Phoenix: The witness stated that he recently received this camera. Judge: Yes, I'm aware of that. Phoenix: He wasn't entirely familiar with its operation. Judge: I'm aware of that, too. Ah! Phoenix: Correct! Why would Cody be looking somewhere else at the critical moment? Because he was looking at his camera! He was trying to take a picture! Cody: Hey! Phoenix: Bullseye! Cody: W-what's your problem, pops! You got a thing for picking on little kids!? Phoenix: (Pressing, not picking...) Mia: Good job, Phoenix! Cody was lying, clearly. Smart of you to realize there was no way he could just stand there, watching his hero... and not take a picture! Phoenix: Right! Cody? There was only one reason why you would have looked away from the fight. And that was because you wanted to take a picture. But having just received your camera, you weren't used to using it yet! So, you missed the climax of the fight. Correct? Cody: ... ... ... Yeah. Mia: Well, Phoenix. I'll bet you anything he's hiding more than that. Have him testify again! Phoenix: R-right. (Mia means business!) Your Honor. The defense would like to request that Cody Hackins testify once more. Judge: V-very well. Cody? Could you please tell us about your camera... And about why you didn't take a picture of the fight? Cody: Umm... Phoenix: (Welcome to the real world, kid!) Witness Testimony -- No Photo? -- Cody: Yeah, you're right, pops. The Steel Samurai had just escaped from the clutches of the villain. So I held up my camera to take a picture! But the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it. Th-that's all that happened. Yup. Judge: Hmm... Anything strange in that testimony, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: I'm not sure... But I'd like to proceed with the cross-examination anyway. Cross Examination -- No Photo? -- Cody: Yeah, you're right, pops. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Pops\"...? Cody: Yeah, I called you \"pops,\" you spiky-haired geezer! Phoenix: G-geezer...? Edgeworth: I'm \"Mr. Edgeworth.\" Judge: And I guess I'm the \"bearded gentleman\"... Cody: That's what I hate about grown-ups. You're all so self-conscious! Phoenix: Okay, off with the kid gloves! Testify, witness, testify! Cody: Yipes! Cody: The Steel Samurai had just escaped from the clutches of the villain. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you did see the beginning of the fight? Cody: Yeah. Phoenix: Did you notice anything unusual? Cody: Umm... well... uh... I guess the Steel Samurai was moving a little strange... Phoenix: (Moving... strangely?) Cody: So I held up my camera to take a picture! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why couldn't you take a picture? Cody: My new camera has too many buttons. I couldn't figure it out. I tried to take a picture, I really tried. Cody: But the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: When the lens opened, what did you see? Cody: Uh... well, a person on the ground. And the Steel Samurai! Cody: Th-that's all that happened. Yup. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: That's all? Cody: Y-yeah! I told you, I didn't take a picture! Phoenix: (Hmm... I would have, once I got that lens open... Did he really not take a picture? Not even one?) Press him hard Phoenix: (Nah, he definitely would have taken a picture. There's got to be something here I can use!) Cody! Listen up, Cody Hackins. I know exactly what happened that day. You took a picture! Cody: ... Hey! Phoenix: (Bullseye...?) Cody: H-how did you know!? Phoenix: I see through all your lies Cody Hackins. It's one of my powers! Cody: W-wow! Phoenix: (This feels great!) Cody: Y-yeah... Yeah, I took a picture. Judge: Perhaps you can change your testimony to reflect this, Cody? Changes statement from \"Th-that's all that happened. Yup.\" to \"I took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em.\" Let it slide Phoenix: (He looks ready to burst into tears... I'd better lay off him for now.) Leads back to cross-examination Cody: I took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You \"erased\" them? Cody: Y-yeah! Phoenix: Why would you erase a picture of your beloved Steel Samurai, victorious? Cody: Well... y'know. W-why would I want to keep a picture like that? Phoenix: (Hmm... he's becoming less and less cooperative. I better find a clear contradiction soon... or some solid evidence.) Present \"Path to Glory\" Phoenix: Leads to: \"Cody!\" Phoenix: (How can I pick holes in such a short testimony?) Mia: There has to be something. Dig up the dirt, Phoenix! Find out what this kid's all about! Phoenix: Cody! Cody: Wh-wh-what!? Man, every time you say \"Cody\" you follow it with something bad. Phoenix: I just wanted to thank you for giving me this the other day. Cody: Huh? O-oh... right. Phoenix: What was it you told me then? Cody: I go to every live performance! I always take a picture when the Steel Samurai lands the final blow! Whizzam! I got 'em all! I never missed one! A perfect collection! Phoenix: Cody. Did you really get a picture of the Steel Samurai standing victorious over his foe? If you did, I find it hard to believe that you would just erase it! Wouldn't you keep it for your album? Cody: Ah! Judge: Mr. Wright... What exactly is this album? Phoenix: It's called \"Path to Glory.\" It's a collection of pictures of the Steel Samurai, all taken by Cody Hackins. He claims it's a perfect collection of every battle the Steel Samurai has won! Judge: I... I see. Phoenix: Don't you find this very odd, Your Honor? Among all his pictures of the Steel Samurai, none were taken that day! Judge: Order! Mr. Wright. Have you an explanation? If the Steel Samurai had just defeated his adversary... I certainly would expect to see a picture of it in this album... Phoenix: Exactly my point, Your Honor! ... ... .........! (No... wait... no way!) Mia: Phoenix? I think we've finally discovered the truth. And what a truth it is! Phoenix: M-Mia... are we sure about this? Did he actually...? Mia: Yes. I'm pretty sure what you're thinking is right. Tell them, Phoenix. Tell them what the truth is. Judge: Mr. Wright! Please explain to the court what is going on here! Why was there no picture in the album from the day of the murder? Why would the boy have erased the photos he took? The photos were blurry Phoenix: I believe that Cody Hackins is what we call an \"artiste.\" Judge: An... \"artiste\"...? Phoenix: He didn't like the photos he had taken! They were blurry, or maybe his framing was off... Anyway, for some reason, he erased the data! Judge: Is that right, Cody? Cody: Wh-what do you mean \"framing was off\"!? Judge: It seems the only thing \"off\" is your guesswork, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Um, uh... Yes, well, I'm sure the real reason is... Judge: Yes? The real reason is? Leads back to: \"Why was there no picture in the album from the day of the murder?\" He erased them by mistake Phoenix: Simple, Your Honor. Cody wasn't used to using his new camera. He erased those photos he took by mistake! Mia: W-wait a second, Phoenix. If that's your answer, we're back where we started! Phoenix: Huh? You mean, that wasn't it? Judge: Mr. Wright! If you have something to say to the court, speak up! Phoenix: Um, well... S-sorry, Your Honor. Can I change my answer? Judge: Hmm... *sigh* Leads back to: \"Why was there no picture in the album from the day of the murder?\" The Steel Samurai didn't win Leads to: \"I can think of only one reason, Your Honor.\" Phoenix: I can think of only one reason, Your Honor. The Steel Samurai didn't win! That's why Cody deleted those photos. Judge: You mean the Steel Samurai... lost? Phoenix: Well, Cody? I'm right, aren't I? Tell the truth. The bad guy defeated the Steel Samurai! Cody: N-n-n-no way! No! I-it's impossible! Th-the Steel Samurai never loses! He never loses to anyone! Ever! Phoenix: Your Honor... The witness has revealed everything with his words. There was a reason why he lied and told us he didn't take a picture. The same reason he erased his precious photos! For Cody, it was inconceivable that the Steel Samurai could be defeated. However, Cody witnessed the impossible! He saw the Steel Samurai lose! Yet to admit what he saw would destroy everything he believed in! That's why he lied and said the Steel Samurai won. He couldn't handle the truth! Judge: O-Order! I will have order! W-witness! I mean, Cody! Is this true!? W-what did you see? Tell the court what you saw! Cody: I...... Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh! Phoenix: Cody... That day, you saw the Steel Samurai lose a fight. Right? Cody: Waaaaaaaaaaaaah! Okay okay! Y-you're right! Th-the Steel Samurai f-fell down... Th-then he didn't m-move... Waaaaaaaaah! Judge: Order! Order! Order! Edgeworth: What kind of stunt are you trying to pull, Wright!? The Steel Samurai was the murderer, not the victim! Phoenix: Yet according to your witness's testimony, the Steel Samurai was the one who fell! Judge: Mr. Wright! What's going on? Phoenix: Apparently, we have all made a serious error. Edgeworth: An... error? What's this all about!? Hammer was the victim Phoenix: Quite simply, the victim was Jack Hammer! Judge: ... Edgeworth: ... ... Judge: Umm... Mr. Wright? We all know that. Phoenix: Right. Judge: Perhaps you'd like to reconsider your last statement? Phoenix: ... I'm sorry. It was I who was wrong. Edgeworth: Okay, Wright! First you're right, now you're wrong!? Which is it!? Phoenix: L-look, I'm sure there's something we're overlooking! Edgeworth: If you're so sure, then tell us what it is! Leads back to: \"What's this all about!?\" Steel Samurai was the victim Leads to: \"If you understand what really happened, it's actually quite simple.\" There was no victim Phoenix: There was no victim in this case! Judge: Wh-wh-what!? Has the defense taken leave of its senses!? Phoenix: Of course, Jack Hammer died. But the Steel Samurai fell too! It was a draw! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ... Sorry. I was too shocked to say anything for a bit there. Listen, Wright! Only one person died in this incident, and that is Jack Hammer! Yet now you claim there \"was no victim\"? Are you insane? Phoenix: (Uh oh, he's pulling out all the stops now.) ... I'm sorry. It was I who was wrong. Edgeworth: Okay, Wright! First you're right, now you're wrong!? Which is it!? Phoenix: L-look, I'm sure there's something we're overlooking! Edgeworth: If you're so sure, then tell us what it is! Leads back to: \"What's this all about!?\" Phoenix: If you understand what really happened, it's actually quite simple. At the end of the fight, the Steel Samurai fell to the ground, and lay still. In other words, the Steel Samurai was not the killer, he was the victim! Don't you see? Jack Hammer was the Steel Samurai! Judge: Order! Order! Order! So, the Steel Samurai in this photograph... You're saying the man in this costume was the victim, Mr. Jack Hammer? Phoenix: That's what I'm saying, Your Honor. Jack Hammer was present at the action scene run-through that morning. Thus, he obviously knew about Will Powers's foot injury. Judge: B-but wait! Hadn't Mr. Hammer gone to Studio One already? Phoenix: That's what everyone thought! But remember what Ms. Oldbag said in her testimony? Oldbag: On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM. Did I see poor old Hammer? Nope. He'd already gone to the studio before I got back to the guard station. Phoenix: Mr. Jack Hammer left the Employee Area after lunch. However, no one saw him going to Studio One. Nor was there a picture of him. He waited for Mr. Powers to take a nap in his dressing room. Then he snuck into the dressing room and stole the Steel Samurai costume. Judge: ... Edgeworth: ... Judge: But why would the victim do such a thing? Phoenix: I... don't know. Cody: ... I get it! Phoenix: ? Cody: I thought that the Steel Samurai was moving strange. So it was a different person inside the suit! Pops! Phoenix: Huh, me? What? Cody: Actually, there was one piece of data I saved. Phoenix: Data? Cody: Yeah, a photo on my digital camera! Phoenix: ! W-what!? Edgeworth: Show us, quick! Cody: No way man, not if you're gonna look at me like that! Judge: Now! Cody: *sniff* Here... This is it. Judge: ... Well, looking at this it's still a little hard to say. I'm afraid that it could be anyone in that costume. Your opinion, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: I agree, Your Honor. This isn't decisive evidence. Judge: I'm sorry, this doesn't look like it's the proof we need. I'll give it back. Mia: Wait, Phoenix! Phoenix: Mia? What? Mia: Look at that photo once more! That's it Phoenix! That photo is all the evidence you need to win this trial! Phoenix: Wh-what!? Y-Your Honor! May I see that photo once more please? Judge: C-certainly. I don't see why not. Mia: Phoenix! Show him! There's a glaring, decisive inconsistency with the facts as we know them in that photo! Phoenix: (Find the inconsistency in the photo!) Present number \"2\" sign Phoenix: Leads to: \"Your Honor! Look at this!\" Present Steel Samurai Phoenix: Phoenix: It's right here! Judge: The Steel Samurai...? Phoenix: Yes, that's about the only thing in this picture that could be inconsistent. The Steel Samurai is inconsistent with... something. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Wright! This is no time for daydreaming and pointless pontification! Think about your client, and us, who are forced to listen to your rambling! Judge: Mr. Wright, please rethink your position. Leads back to: \"Find the inconsistency in the photo!\" Present anywhere else Phoenix: Phoenix: I think it's here. Judge: You seem to be lacking even more confidence than usual. Phoenix: I suppose that's because I'm not confident about it at all. Judge: Maybe you want to rethink your case, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yes, please, Your Honor. Leads back to: \"Find the inconsistency in the photo!\" Phoenix: Your Honor! Look at this! Judge: I see... a gate? Phoenix: Might I draw your attention to the number on that gate? Judge: The number? Ah yes. Well, it's hard to see, but it looks like a \"2.\" Phoenix: Clearly not a \"1,\" Your Honor, correct? Edgeworth: Aaaaaah! Phoenix: I believe Mr. Edgeworth sees what I'm getting at. Edgeworth: B-but... Th-that's impossible! Judge: Hmm? Eh? What's this all about? Please explain so that I might be shocked along with the rest of the court. Phoenix: I'll use the studio guidemap. The body was found here, in Studio One. However, what do we see in this photo taken at the time of the murder? It does NOT say \"1\" on that gate in the photo. Your Honor! Here is the true scene of the crime! (Show the judge where the murder took place!) Present Studio Two Phoenix: Leads to: \"Here, at Studio Two.\" Present anywhere else Phoenix: Phoenix: It was here! Judge: What does that have to do with the number on the gate in the photograph...? Phoenix: Umm... well... Sorry, Your Honor, I guess I hadn't thought it that far through yet. Judge: Think it through before you point at the map this time, Mr. Wright! Once again! Where is he scene of this crime? Leads back to: \"Show the judge where the murder took place!\" Phoenix: Here, at Studio Two. Judge: I see! That would explain the \"2\" on the gate in the photo. Phoenix: Your Honor, I find it very significant that the murder took place in Studio Two! The trailer is there Phoenix: As you may recall, there is a trailer in Studio Two. Now, on that day, a meeting was held in that very trailer. There was a break in the meeting corresponding to the time of death. During that break, Mr. Sal Manella and Ms. Dee Vasquez were outside, eating steak. They were at the scene of the crime! The path to the trailer was blocked! Judge: So we have heard. Phoenix: The path was blocked at 2:15... In other words, the victim went to Studio Two before that time! Judge: Yes... yes, I suppose that would be the case. Phoenix: Remember Mr. Sal Manella's testimony? Allow me to remind the court: He said no one in the trailer was guilty because they could not have gone to Studio One. Yet, in actuality, the reverse was true! Only someone in the trailer could have committed this murder! They were the only ones with access to the scene of the crime: Studio Two! Leads to: \"O-order! Order!\" The path was blocked Phoenix: The path to the trailer was blocked! Judge: So we have heard. Phoenix: The path was blocked at 2:15... In other words, the victim went to Studio Two before that time! Judge: Yes... yes, I suppose that would be the case. Phoenix: Remember Mr. Sal Manella's testimony? Allow me to remind the court: He said no one in the trailer was guilty because they could not have gone to Studio One. Yet, in actuality, the reverse was true! Only someone in the trailer could have committed this murder! They were the only ones with access to the scene of the crime: Studio Two! As you may recall, there is a trailer in Studio Two. Now, on that day, a meeting was held in that very trailer. There was a break in the meeting corresponding to the time of death. During that break, Mr. Sal Manella and Ms. Dee Vasquez were outside, eating steak. They were at the scene of the crime! Leads to: \"O-order! Order!\" No filming is done there Phoenix: Studio Two is no longer being used for filming! Judge: I see... And this is significant... why? Phoenix: (Good question! I really should think these things through more.) Judge: Would you like to take another stab at it? So to speak? Phoenix: S-stabbing away, Your Honor. Leads back to: \"Your Honor, I find it very significant that the murder took place in Studio Two!\" Judge: O-order! Order! Phoenix: The defense makes the following claims: The scene of the crime was Studio Two! The person that the security guard, Ms. Oldbag saw was the victim, Mr. Jack Hammer! Mr. Hammer, for some reason, stole a Steel Samurai costume. Then he went to Studio Two! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This is madness! Jack Hammer is the victim! The victim! Why would he steal a Steel Samurai costume!? Are you suggesting he did so to cover up the details of his own murder!? Phoenix: W-well, no, of course not... Judge: Hmm... Edgeworth: Or do you have proof!? Give me proof that the victim, Jack Hammer, stole the costume! I have proof Phoenix: I have proof! Edgeworth: Y-you do!? Judge: You do, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: (Now that they're so surprised suddenly I'm much less confident... I think I'm right, though!) Leads to: \"Here's my proof that Jack Hammer stole the costume!\" I don't have proof Phoenix: (Proof? Uh oh... I'm pretty sure I don't have anything like that...) Mia: Phoenix. Even if you're not 100% sure about this, you have to try. And I think you've got proof that's good enough to win them over! Just go for it! All or nothing! Phoenix: Your Honor... Judge: Yes, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Actually... I do have proof. Leads to: \"Here's my proof that Jack Hammer stole the costume!\" Phoenix: Here's my proof that Jack Hammer stole the costume! Present Empty Bottle Phoenix: Leads to: \"This is it.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: (Wait, no, that can't be right... I've got to have some proof that will knock their socks off...) Judge: Mr. Wright! We don't have all the time in the world, here. Phoenix: Y-yes, Your Honor! Leads back to: \"Here's my proof that Jack Hammer stole the costume!\" Phoenix: This is it. Judge: An empty... medicine bottle? Phoenix: I found this on the table in the Employee Area. The same table where Mr. Hammer and Mr. Powers ate. The label reads \"sleeping pills.\" Judge: \"Sleeping pills\"...? Phoenix: The defendant, Mr. Powers, spent that entire afternoon sleeping. He was drugged... by Mr. Hammer! Judge: Wait a moment... That bottle does raise some suspicions, yes. But there is no proof that Mr. Hammer used it. Phoenix: Your Honor, I have an idea. Test Powers's blood Judge: An... idea? Continue. Phoenix: Run a test of Powers's blood. You should find traces of the sleeping pills. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: This much time after the day of the murder!? Even if there were traces it still proves nothing! No blood test could tell that Hammer was the one who drugged him, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (He's right. Darn. That didn't work. Time to try another idea.) Leads back to: \"Your Honor, I have an idea.\" Fingerprint the bottle Leads to: \"An... idea? Very well, let's hear it.\" Examine Hammer's body Judge: An idea, Mr. Wright? And that would be? Phoenix: Er... we should examine Mr. Hammer's body. Judge: Mr. Hammer...? I thought that it was Mr. Powers who was made to take the sleeping pills? Phoenix: I-indeed it was, Your Honor. (Wrong again...) Leads back to: \"Your Honor, I have an idea.\" Judge: An... idea? Very well, let's hear it. Phoenix: I want to check this bottle for fingerprints! If my claim is true, Mr. Hammer's fingerprints should show up on this bottle! Edgeworth: Hmm... Judge: I suppose you're right. Very well. The court will take possession of the bottle. Empty Bottle given to the judge. Judge: This court will suspend proceedings on the current trial for today. Cody Hackin's [sic] testimony has revealed new possibilities in this case. In fact, things may have happened very differently than we previously thought. The Steel Samurai seen by Ms. Oldbag may have been the victim, Jack Hammer. The scene of the crime was not Studio One, but Studio Two. And those in the trailer did have time to commit murder. Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor? Judge: Your homework is to find the answer to the following question: Why would Mr. Hammer steal the Steel Samurai costume? Also, who killed him, and why? Find the answers for me by tomorrow. Phoenix: (That's a lot of homework!) Judge: Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Mm? Judge: You will need to reconsider your stance in this case. Above all, you will need to reconsider your suspicion of Mr. Will Powers. Edgeworth: As you say, Your Honor. Judge: This trial will be extended until tomorrow. This is the last extension! Very well... Court is adjourned! October 19, 2:47 PMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1 Phoenix: Whew! That was a close one! Mia: We were saved by a hair, but that's all that counts. I thought seriously about going home about three times during the trial. Phoenix: M-me too! Will: Really? You both seemed so... so confident! Phoenix: Hah! Maybe I should take up a career in acting? I was ready to pronounce you dead about three times back there. Mia: Me too! Will: D-dead!? Mia: Hoh hoh. Of course, we're kidding. Will: Are you sure? Phoenix: (I wasn't kidding...) Now, Mr. Powers. We have to go make our final investigation. But I promise you, we'll find the true killer by tomorrow's trial! Will: R-right! Thanks! *sniff* To be continued. Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! What do you think about the witness's statement? Judge: Uh... I'm not sure I follow? Phoenix: It clearly, er, contradicts the... um... I thought... Judge: You don't sound very convinced, Mr. Wright. Objection overruled. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor! That statement contradicts this evidence! Judge: ...? It does? I don't see anything contradictory... Phoenix: Huh? Really? Judge: Objection overruled. Try to think before you make accusations, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (Whoops! That didn't go so well.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: This evidence clearly reveals the contradiction in that statement, Your Honor! Judge: How exactly are that evidence and the statement just now related...? Phoenix: They aren't, are they... Judge: Not at all. Mr. Wright, please think the facts over before making accusations. Phoenix: (I don't think that won me any points with the judge...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: The witness's statement is clearly faulty, Your Honor! Judge: ... I'm sorry, but I can see nothing faulty. Unfortunately, I will have to penalize you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Ugh, I must be on the wrong track?) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! This court see no reason to further prolong the trial. Phoenix: (Uh oh...) Judge: This court finds the defendant, Mr. Will Powers... Guilty Judge: The accused will surrender to the court immediately, to be held pending trial at a higher court within a month from today's date. That is all. The court is adjourned! Turnabout Samurai Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 Part 5 Part 6 October 19, 3:27 PMWright & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: That was a close one, huh, Mia? Maya: Really? Too bad, I'm sorry I missed it. Phoenix: ? M-Maya! Maya: So, what happened? Phoenix: Well, I think I've got a pretty good idea who did it. Now all I need is a motive... and proof. Maya: Wow! Good going, Nick! Phoenix: Under the \"initial trial\" system, tomorrow is the last day we have. Maya: \"Initial trial\"...? What's that? Phoenix: That's the new court system they introduced two or three years ago. They had so many cases in the system, they decided to speed the whole process up. Maya: So, under that system, trials have to end in three days? Phoenix: Yeah, pretty much. Well, we've no time to waste! Talk The Steel Samurai Phoenix: I don't get it, Maya. Why would Mr. Hammer steal the Steel Samurai costume? Maya: What!? You mean Mr. Hammer was wearing the costume!? Phoenix: Yeah! Maya: B-but Mr. Hammer was the victim, Nick! Why would he go through the trouble of stealing it? Phoenix: That's what we have to find out. The director's alibi Maya: What happened with the director's testimony? Phoenix: Well, it's pretty clear that the producer and the director were both in the trailer. Maya: Huh... Phoenix: Which means that the killer has to be one of them! Maya: Really!? Why? Phoenix: Because the real scene of the crime was Studio Two... where that trailer is! Maya: Whaaaat!? Phoenix: (Hmm... was Maya always this excitable?) Any ideas Phoenix: Well, have you noticed anything that might help us? Maya: I can't see what's going on when Mia is here... So, no. I haven't noticed anything. Phoenix: Right... Maya: Maybe we should go talk to WP? Phoenix: (WP... Powers... right.) Present Powers's(?) Photo Phoenix: (Who would have thought that it was Jack Hammer inside! But why did he steal it? That's what I have to figure out.) Maya: ...? Samurai Spear Maya: I wish I had my own Samurai Spear! Just think, I could poke you as much as I wanted! Phoenix: Me!? Why me!? \"Path to Glory\" Phoenix: What do you think about this? It's that fanboy's prized possession. Maya: Wow! Impressive! ... It's a little different from the Steel Samurai on TV... Phoenix: These are mostly taken at those PR shows they do at stores and fairs... I'm pretty sure it's not even Will Powers inside that suit. Maya: No true fan would be satisfied with anything less than the real thing! He's still a child, I suppose... I guess it takes an adult to appreciate the real deal. Right, Nick? Phoenix: Um, yeah, whatever you say. Cody's Camera Phoenix: This is Cody's-- Maya: Hey! A digital camera! I'm impressed a kid like him would have something this expensive. Kids these days! Phoenix: (I don't imagine spirit mediums-in-training get a lot of toys...) October 19Detention CenterVisitor's Room Will: Mr. Wright! You did very well again today... Thank you! Phoenix: Oh... thanks. Um, could you not look like you're about to burst into tears...? Maya: Wow, Nick! You must have really wowed 'em in there. Phoenix: And could you wipe that grin off your face? (Changed from [You could stop looking so... vulnerable, too.] in the original release) Maya: Hey, WP! Only one day left! Let's make it count! Will: Yes... Though there's not really anything I can do to help. Maya: Hah hah hah! I'm not really sure what I can do, either. Phoenix: Please... this is no laughing matter. Talk Producer Vasquez Phoenix: Could you tell me more about Ms. Vasquez? Will: Oh... the producer? She's well respected in the industry. They say she's a genius. Maya: A genius...? Will: She's been at Global Studios for five years now. Right or wrong, nobody dares tell her different these days. Phoenix: Why is that? Will: Ever since she came on board, we've had nothing but hits. Global Studios was on its knees, but she picked it up and made it shine. Oh, and... Maya: And... what? Will: N-nothing. Forget it. I... I've only heard rumors, anyhow. Director Manella Phoenix: Can you tell me anything about Mr. Manella? Will: Oh, he used to be a minor straight-to-video director. But something in his work caught Vasquez's eye. She brought the Steel Samurai idea to him. Now everyone knows the name Sal Manella. I hear he's pretty much at her beck and call, though. Whenever she says \"jump!\" he asks \"how high?\" and all that. Phoenix: (I can imagine him being at her beck and call... though I can't imagine him jumping.) Mr. Hammer Maya: I was wondering about Mr. Hammer... He was a big star back in the day, right? But then he just dropped off the face of the Earth. Will: Oh... Yes, you're right. In fact, he was my role model when I started in this business. But he just stopped taking on big roles. That's when he began appearing in little productions at Global... Maya: How could he do that!? I was really looking forward to a sequel to \"Samurai Summer.\" Will: He just gave up being a star five years ago. Actually, now that I think about it... That was right when Ms. Vasquez came to Global. Phoenix: (Five years ago...?) Present Powers's(?) Photo Phoenix: Here's that picture again. Will: I-is that really Jack Hammer inside that suit? Phoenix: He's the only one who it could have been. Will: But why would he...? Maya: Yeah! Why? Phoenix: You're the medium! Why don't you summon up Mr. Hammer's spirit and ask him yourself? Maya: *sigh* Gimme about three more years. Phoenix: (Look at us, the two novices.) \"Path to Glory\" Phoenix: Have you seen this, Mr. Powers? Will: W-what's that!? I've never seen these Steel Samurais in my life... Phoenix: These are the Steel Samurais that appear at live shows. A fanboy collected all these pictures himself. Will: ... Seeing things like this really makes me think... I mean so much to these kids, you know? *sniff* Anything else Will: E-excuse me. Thank you for showing me that, whatever it is. I wish I could think of some way for me to help you... S-sorry. *sniff* October 19Global StudiosMain Gate Oldbag: ... ... ... Maya: The old windbag sure is quiet today. Oldbag: ... Maya: You know, this place is really... peaceful, like this. Oldbag: ... Maya: Nick? I think her guard's down... Phoenix: Y-yeah? Maya: I bet we could even eat those donuts in the guard station... if we wanted. Oldbag: ... You eat, you die. Maya: Whew! She's alive! Talk Producer Vasquez Phoenix: Um, I was wondering about Dee Vasquez, the producer. Oldbag: Oh, the studio bigwigs LOVE her. So she always gets her way. Phoenix: (She seems bitter...) Maya: Do you... not like the producer? Oldbag: Look, the studio people don't want me talking about her, so, sorry. Director Manella Phoenix: Can I ask you about Sal Manella, the director? Oldbag: Sal? He's soft--a pushover. Does whatever Vasquez tells him to. She treats him like dirt, but I think he likes it. Maya: Huh? Why would anyone like being treated like dirt? That doesn't make any sense, does it, Nick? Phoenix: Er... No, no it doesn't, Maya. Mr. Hammer Phoenix: About Mr. Hammer... Oldbag: Arrgh! I heard about what you said today! Cheeky whippersnapper! Poor old Hammer! You'd drag his star down from the sky and stomp on it! Calling him a criminal! A thief! I-I-I-I... I won't forget this!!! Phoenix: (Uh oh, she's really pissed this time!) Oldbag: You listen to me, whippersnapper! My poor old Hammer would never do such a thing! Why would he steal Powers's costume so he could sneak by me? He would never stoop so low! It's impossible! Present Powers's(?) Photo Phoenix: Um, Ms. Oldbag? Oldbag: What!? Get that filth out of my sight! And you're claiming that's poor old Hammer in there!? And I thought you were such an innocent youth... Bah! Anything else Phoenix: Um, Ms. Oldbag? What do you think of this? Oldbag: Think? I'm not in the mood for thinking, thank you very much. October 19Studio One Entrance Maya: Think back, Nick, to the day of the murder... Mr. Hammer put on the Steel Samurai costume. Then he left from here to go to Studio Two...? Phoenix: Right. Maya: But why? I wonder if someone called him...? Like the director, or the producer...? Examine Left path Phoenix: Studio Two is down that way. Studio Two... the real scene of the crime. Maya: Say, Nick, how did you figure that out again? Phoenix: Well... ... Actually, it's a long story, I'll tell you another time. Maya: Aww. Mr. Monkey statue Phoenix: The mascot of Global Studios. Apparently its name is \"Mr. Monkey.\" Security camera Phoenix: This security camera takes photos of everyone who comes through the gate. It doesn't seem to be switched on today. Studio One entrance Phoenix: The entrance to Studio One. This is the studio where they found Jack Hammer's body. I don't have that cardkey anymore, so I can't go in there today. Welcome sign Maya: It says \"Welcome.\" Phoenix: They let people in here when they're not filming, right? Maya: Nick! Let's come here some day! Whaddya say? Phoenix: Sure, if Ms. Oldbag lets us in. October 19Studio Two Entrance Maya: Hey, Nick... It's Ms. Vasquez! Hello? Vasquez: ... Maya: H-E-L-L-O! Vasquez: ... Maya: H! E! L! L! O! Phoenix: M-Maya! You should at least try to be polite... Vasquez: ... I'm watching the clouds. ... Phoenix: (That's all she had to say, apparently...) Examine Lunch table Phoenix: This is where Sal Manella and Dee Vasquez ate. There's nothing left on the plates. Maya: Hey, so they ate t-bone steaks too. ... Phoenix: Something wrong? Maya: I don't know... I'm getting this funny feeling. Something about this just feels... odd, you know? Phoenix: Can't say that I do... Number \"2\" sign Phoenix: There's a big \"2\" painted here. So this is the number in Cody's photograph. And to think, if he hadn't brought that photograph in... Maya: Don't get all teary eyed yet. Flower garden Phoenix: There're some flowers here. Maya: Wow, so pretty! They're taking good care of these. Phoenix: Don't get too close. That fence looks dangerous. Trailer door Phoenix: The trailer door. It's locked. Talk Mr. Hammer Maya: Um, excuse me? Mr. Hammer came here on the day of the murder, and... Vasquez: Shh. Maya: ? Vasquez: Perhaps you didn't hear me. I'm watching the clouds. I'm not interested in talking to you. Maya: Do something, Nick! She's really ticking me off! Phoenix: (Oh dear...) Will Powers Maya: Umm... Mr. Powers wasn't the killer! You don't have to cancel the Steel Samurai! Vasquez: I think I'm tired of the Steel Samurai. Maya: You... you did it! Nick! She did it! She's the killer! My Fey blood speaks to me! I know it! I know it! Phoenix: (Oh dear...) Director Manella Phoenix: Um, I was wondering if you could tell me about Mr. Manella? Vasquez: ... If you must talk about that man... Perhaps you could talk about it in the trailer? By yourselves? Phoenix: (Oh, oh dear...) Present Anything Vasquez: ... Phoenix: (She's not even looking.) Okay. Hey, you look. Maya: Wh-why are you showing that to me, Nick? October 19Studio Two Trailer Maya: ... Wasn't the assistant cleaning up yesterday? Funny, it still seems pretty messy in here. Phoenix: I guess she was still on a high from getting that rare card she needed. Examine Left poster Phoenix: An old movie poster. \"'The Singing Samurai' starring Jack Hammer.\" What the hell do samurai sing about? Chopping off heads? Maya: Oh. My. God. That movie was the best! It's about a samurai who sings his way to fame and fortune! Mr. Hammer was a very accomplished singer, you know. Phoenix: Singing samurai stars... What's next? Ninja ballet? October 19Global StudiosEmployee Area Maya: I guess they're not filming today, either. I did want to see them filming... just one time. Phoenix: This trial will be over and done by tomorrow. You can come see them film later. Maya: I guess... This is where you found that bottle of sleeping pills, right? Phoenix: Uh huh. Maya: I wonder if there're any other clues lying around. Gumshoe: Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarh! No no no! No touchin'! Maya: Eeek! Gumshoe: Oh, sorry, pal. Didn't mean to frighten you. Maya: D-didn't mean...? I almost had a heart attack! Gumshoe: Heh heh. I guess I can be a little dramatique at times... I suppose it's the actor in me... Phoenix: (\"Dramatique\" indeed...) Gumshoe: Ahem. Anyway, I'm here to examine the plate on that table. Phoenix: Wait, are you looking for sleeping pills? Gumshoe: Yeah, pal. Traces thereof. Examine Drain grate Phoenix: That grate's still lying here. Maya: Ah, they've seen wisdom at last! They know if they fixed it I'd just kick it off again. Phoenix: That poor assistant... Lunch table Phoenix: The remains of the employees' lunch are scattered around. Everyone was probably too shocked to clean up. There's a t-bone on one of the plates, minus the steak. Dressing room door Phoenix: The door to the dressing room. It's not locked. Vending machine Phoenix: Let's see... cola, candy, chips, gum... Huh. It's so... normal. Talk The plate Maya: So you're looking for traces of the sleeping pills... how? Gumshoe: For a thorough examination I gotta take the plate back to the precinct. But I have the capabilities to make a cursory examination right here! Our science guy gave me some testing solution. This reacts to sleeping pills, see? If there're traces it'll change color. Maya: Wow! Neat! Well, Detective Gumshoe? What are you waiting for? Gumshoe: Now, now, everything in due time, pal. ... ... ... Well, the testing solution on the plate changed color alright. Phoenix: So the food on this plate had been laced with sleeping pills! (Changed from [So there were sleeping pills on the plate!] in the original release) Gumshoe: Looks like it. Steak Plate added to the Court Record. The plate (subsequent times) Maya: So you're looking for traces of the sleeping pills... how? Gumshoe: For a thorough examination I gotta take the plate back to the precinct. But I have the capabilities to make a cursory examination right here! Our science guy gave me some testing solution. This reacts to sleeping pills, see? If there're traces it'll change color. Maya: Wow! Neat! Well, Detective Gumshoe? What are you waiting for? Gumshoe: Now, now, everything in due time, pal. ... ... ... Well, the testing solution on the plate changed color alright. Phoenix: So the food on this plate had been laced with sleeping pills! (Changed from [So there were sleeping pills on the plate!] in the original release) Gumshoe: Looks like it. The investigation Phoenix: How goes your investigation? Gumshoe: To tell the truth, it's a real mess, pal. Some people think we should pursue the case we already have against Powers... And some people think we should switch suspects! Maya: What do you think, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Well, pal, I hate to admit it... But I'm not sure I buy the case against Mr. Powers any more. I feel kind of bad for Mr. Edgeworth, though. Prosecutor Edgeworth Phoenix: How is Edgeworth doing, anyway? Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth is outta control! (Changed from [Edgeworth is out of control!] in the original release) He was in the waiting room and he crushed this paper cup with hot, hot coffee in it. Phoenix: Whoa... Gumshoe: Talk about burns, pal! Maya: Wow! The fury of Edgeworth! Phoenix: Yeah, crushing paper cups... (Cups... bottles...?) Say, what ever happened with that empty bottle? Gumshoe: Oh, the bottle of sleeping pills? Well, I got some good news for you about that. They found the victim, Jack Hammer's prints on the bottle. Maya: So that means... Gumshoe: Yep, it sounds like the one who put Powers to sleep was none other than... the victim! Phoenix: (So I was right!) Sleeping Pill Bottle added to the Court Record. Prosecutor Edgeworth (subsequent times) Phoenix: How is Edgeworth doing, anyway? Gumshoe: Mr. Edgeworth is outta control! (Changed from [Edgeworth is out of control!] in the original release) He was in the waiting room and he crushed this paper cup with hot, hot coffee in it. Phoenix: Whoa... Gumshoe: Talk about burns, pal! Maya: Wow! The fury of Edgeworth! Present Steak Plate Gumshoe: It's looking like Will Powers was drugged... I'm going to go back to the precinct to do some more detailed tests. Maya: You're being very... free with your information today, Detective. Gumshoe: Well... don't go telling anyone this, pal. But I was kind of impressed at today's trial, too. Maya: ...! Gumshoe: Most lawyers would've given up after that director's testimony. I think if it'd been anyone but you up there, Powers would be done for by now. Sleeping Pill Bottle Phoenix: Detective, about that bottle... Gumshoe: Oh, that? Talk about embarrassing, pal! I can't believe I missed that on my first sweep for evidence. Don't know how I can apologize to Mr. Edgeworth. Maya: It must be tough being a detective, with all that responsibility... Gumshoe: Oh, heh heh. *blush* Anything else Gumshoe: I'm guessing I know as much about that as you do, pal, i.e. nothing. Before clearing all Talk options in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: October 18Global StudiosDressing Room Maya: Empty dressing rooms like this are kinda lonely, aren't they? Phoenix: I'm sure Mr. Powers will be back soon. He'll be fine... Maya: Y-yeah... Examine Cosmetics Phoenix: There's an array of cosmetics here. This is the wig used in \"Samurai Boogey-Woogey.\" Maya: Wow! You remembered, Nick! Phoenix: Thanks to you... Costume rack Phoenix: There are some regular suits in among the costumes here. Those must be his own clothes. Couch Phoenix: Looks like someone was sleeping here. Maya: Well, we can be pretty sure WP did take a nap here, like he said. Phoenix: I'm not sure being drugged counts as taking a \"nap\"... Mirror Phoenix: They always have mirrors like this in dressing rooms. I always check my hairdo when I look in a mirror. Hmm... not quite as spiky as usual, I see. Bag Phoenix: Mr. Powers's bag. Maya: I hope WP can come pick it up himself, soon. Phoenix: Soon, soon. Table Phoenix: There's a box for snacks on the table. They must give these to the employees. Hmm. It's completely empty. ... I can feel Maya's eyes burning into the back of my neck. Dressing Room (after clearing all Talk options in Detention Center - Visitor's Room) Penny: Oh! Hello! Maya: What are you doing here? Penny: Oh... I was just cleaning up the dressing room. I guess WP won't be using it anymore, so... Maya: Wha!? What!? Why!? But WP's innocent! Penny: Yes, and I'm really grateful for all you've done. But... This week is the last episode of the Steel Samurai... Maya: What!? Nooooooooooooooooo! Examine Couch Phoenix: Looks like someone was sleeping here. Penny: Oh, sorry. I haven't cleaned up there yet. Bag Phoenix: It's Powers's bag. Penny: I put all of WP's personal belongings in there. He'll be able to come pick them up, right? Phoenix: I'm sure he'll come, yes. Talk Mr. Hammer Phoenix: I was wondering if I could ask you about Mr. Hammer... Penny: Yes? Phoenix: On the day of the murder, he went to Studio Two. Penny: Huh? I thought he went to Studio One? Maya: He stole the Steel Samurai costume, too! Penny: What!? Why would Mr. Hammer do something like that? ... Oh... I guess the rumor must be true, then. Maya: The rumor? Penny: Yeah. Mr. Vasquez, that producer, had some kind of hold on Hammer. She had some dirt on him... He'd do anything she said, apparently. Maya: Some \"dirt\"? What dirt! Penny: ... Dirt. You know, bad stuff. Maya: ... Um, I know what dirt means... Penny: About five years ago, they were filming a movie starring Mr. Hammer. They were using the new studio... Studio Two. Some sort of accident happened during filming. After that, they never used Studio Two again. They left the film set the way it was, too. Phoenix: (The film set...? Was that trailer part of the film set, then?) The last episode Maya: W-what do you mean, the \"last Steel Samurai\"!? Penny: I know it's a shock, but nothing can be done to save it now. Whoever really did kill Mr. Hammer, also signed the Steel Samurai's death warrant. Maya: No... no! Penny: Also, I hear that Global Studios is going to change its programming. They're not going to make kids' shows anymore. Maya: W-what!? Why!? Penny: I don't know. It's sad, but that's what Global Studios decided. Studio policy (appears after \"The last episode\") Phoenix: Why aren't they going to make kids' shows anymore? Penny: The studio bigwigs don't want the Steel Samurai around anymore. They want to forget all this ever happened. They want it quiet, you understand? Maya: H-how can they just do that! What about all the kids who love the Steel Samurai! Penny: It's okay. I'm sure the kids will be fine. They'll find a new hero to follow. Maya: No, that can't be true! If the program just ends, they'll be heartbroken for sure! N-Nick! Say something! Phoenix: Umm... yeah. (I think evidence, rather than words, is called for here.) Here, take a look at this. Present \"Path to Glory\" Phoenix: Leads to: \"And this is...?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Penny: What's this? Phoenix: This is why you can't stop the Steel Samurai. Penny: I'm sorry... I don't understand. Maya: Neither do I, Nick. Phoenix: F-funny that. I don't either! (Oops. Let's try that again.) Leads back to: \"I think evidence, rather than words, is called for here.\" Penny: And this is...? Phoenix: A fan collected all of these photographs. The kids love the Steel Samurai! The show shouldn't be cancelled just so some adults can save face! I would think you would understand that better than anyone. Penny: ... ... You're right... Okay! But what can I do? Phoenix: Well, for starters... You can tell me something. Tell me what it is that Global Studios is so intent on hiding? Tell me about this accident five years ago. Penny: ... Okay! Five years ago (appears after \"Mr. Hammer\", before clearing \"Studio policy\" Talk option) Phoenix: An accident five years ago? Penny: Yes, in Studio Two. That trailer there was part of the film set. Phoenix: Could you tell us what happened? Penny: ... S-sorry. I don't think I can. They really don't want us to talk about it. Five years ago (after clearing \"Studio policy\" Talk option) Phoenix: Could you tell us what happened five years ago? Penny: Well, I can tell you what I've heard. Apparently, five years ago, someone died... and it was Hammer's fault. Maya: S-someone died!? Penny: It was an accident, of course! Anyway... The producer, Ms. Vasquez managed to hush it up. Phoenix: And that's the \"dirt\" she had on Mr. Hammer? Maya: And that's why Mr. Hammer would do anything Ms. Vasquez asked him to do! ... But, it was an accident, right? Why didn't they just make it public? Penny: Well, you know Mr. Hammer was a big star back then. They were afraid about what would happen to his career if word got out. Maya: I see... Penny: You know who knows more about this? Ms. Oldbag. She was here at the studios back then, you know. Phoenix: Thanks. We'll try asking her. (If she'll talk...) Present Powers's(?) Photo Penny: So this photo was Mr. Hammer all along? Phoenix: It seems that way. Penny: Why would Mr. Hammer do something like that? \"Path to Glory\" Penny: Wow... wow! It must have taken him forever to collect all these. Maya: Kids love the Steel Samurai. Penny: They do, don't they? Sleeping Pill Bottle Penny: What's that? Phoenix: An empty bottle of sleeping pills. With Mr. Hammer's fingerprints on it... Penny: ... Now I'm really confused! Anything else Penny: I'm sorry... I'm not sure what to make of that. Studio - Main Gate (after clearing \"Five years ago\" Talk option upon clearing \"Studio policy\" Talk option in Global Studios - Dressing Room) Oldbag: What, you're still slinking around? If you like the place so much, why don't you take over for me? Maya: The old windbag doesn't look so good... Oldbag: E-everybody's doing their darnedest to forget Hammer. Who do they think made Global Studios what it is today? Hammer! It's all due to Hammer! Maya: She's starting to froth at the mouth, Nick... Maybe we should keep a safe distance? Talk Five years ago Phoenix: Umm... I wanted to ask you about five years ago... Oldbag: ! Who told!? Who did you hear that from!? Phoenix: I, uh... huh? Oldbag: Nichols! Phoenix: N-nickels? Maya: Nichols, Nick. Penny Nichols. That assistant we talked to. Phoenix: O-oh, right. Anyway, we heard about the accident. It was during filming with Jack Hammer... He killed a man. Didn't he? Oldbag: Wh-whippersnappers! Dredging up dirt on someone's past like that... and the recently departed, no less! I suppose you think this is fun!? Phoenix: N-no, I'm just doing my job to protect Mr. Powers... Oldbag: And you claim that Hammer stole Powers's costume! You expect me to believe that rubbish!? Or do you have some kind of proof? Phoenix: (Proof that Hammer stole Powers's costume? Hmm...) I have proof Phoenix: I'm sorry Ms. Oldbag, but I do have proof. I can prove that Mr. Hammer stole Mr. Powers's costume. Present Steak Plate Phoenix: Phoenix: Mr. Powers ate a t-bone steak for lunch, correct? Oldbag: W-well... yes. So? Phoenix: This is the plate that he used to eat that steak. There are traces of sleeping pill powder on the plate! Oldbag: Mmmph? Hah! I-I bet Powers put it in there himself! Even a lightweight like him must have trouble sleeping sometimes. Phoenix: Except, I have proof that Mr. Hammer put the pills in. Present Sleeping Pill Bottle Phoenix: Phoenix: This bottle contained sleeping pills. Mr. Hammer's fingerprints were found on the bottle. Leads to: \"...!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Oldbag: Hmph! What's that supposed to prove!? That means nothing to me! Maya: Nick... I'm kinda having trouble figuring that one out too. Phoenix: (Hmm... wrong evidence? But I know Oldbag knows something! I have to get her to talk!) Leads back to Talk options Present Sleeping Pill Bottle Phoenix: Phoenix: Here's my proof. Oldbag: What? What's a little empty bottle supposed to prove? Phoenix: It's a bottle of sleeping pills. With Mr. Hammer's fingerprints on it... Oldbag: Wh-what does that prove? I... I'm sure old Hammer had some sleepless nights! Where's your proof that he used those pills on Powers? Present Steak Plate Phoenix: Phoenix: Mr. Powers ate a t-bone steak for lunch, correct? Oldbag: W-well... yes. So? Phoenix: This is the plate that he used to eat that steak.

I see how you work! Anything that doesn't fit, you just blame on the dead! Well... well... Just butt out, lawyer-boy! Phoenix: (She knows something! But how am I going to get her to talk...?) Leads back to Talk options Present Anything Oldbag: Sorry... I don't want to think about it anymore. Oldbag: ...! ... ... I see. Poor, poor Hammer. You did wrong, Hammer, rest your soul. Maya: Ms. Oldbag...? Oldbag: Okay. You win. I'll talk. I'm tired, see... Tired of holding it all in. Phoenix: Ms. Oldbag... Oldbag: You're right. Five years ago there was an accident... a fatal accident. What's worse, a paparazzi took a photo of it. That photo, well, it caused quite a stir. And guess who made it all better? Vasquez! She has ties to the mafia... She silenced that paparazzi. That was the beginning. After that, she became a force to be reckoned with here at the studio. Maya: I see...! Oldbag: But, you have to understand... Poor old Hammer never meant any harm to anyone! Maya: Ms. Oldbag... Oldbag: Hold on a minute. Maya: Poor Ms. Oldbag... Oldbag: Here, take this. Phoenix: ...? A photograph? W-wait a second! Oldbag: This is the picture. Phoenix: Is... this the trailer in Studio Two? Oldbag: Hammer was supposed to fight with a bad guy on the top of those stairs, there. He pushed the other actor, and the man fell onto the flowerbox fence. Phoenix: B-but how did you get this? Oldbag: It... was a long time ago. I don't feel much like talking about it. Phoenix: I understand... Five-Year-Old Photo added to the Court Record. Talk Five years ago Oldbag: You're right. Five years ago there was an accident... a fatal accident. What's worse, a paparazzi took a photo of it. That photo, well, it caused quite a stir. And guess who made it all better? Vasquez! She has ties to the mafia... She silenced that paparazzi. That was the beginning. After that, she became a force to be reckoned with here at the studio. Maya: I see...! Oldbag: But, you have to understand... Poor old Hammer never meant any harm to anyone! Maya: Ms. Oldbag... Present Five-Year-Old Photo Oldbag: Poor old Hammer. He was a big star. The biggest. That accident five years ago is what did him in. He wanted to hide it. He didn't want anyone to know. Poor, silly old Hammer. If he had just come out and confessed... Then Vasquez wouldn't have gotten her claws into him! Employee Area Maya: Detective Gumshoe must have left by now. Phoenix: He's probably thinking about what to do in tomorrow's trial. Maya: I bet Edgeworth is pretty angry with him. Move Dressing Room Leads to: \"The assistant must have gone off somewhere.\" Dressing Room Maya: The assistant must have gone off somewhere. That stuff about Mr. Hammer must have come as a shock to her. Outside Studio Two Present Five-Year-Old Photo Leads to: \"...\" Vasquez: ... Phoenix: (She's not even looking.) Vasquez: Where. Phoenix: Wh-what? Vasquez: Where did you get that? Phoenix: I, well... Vasquez: Oldbag. Phoenix: O-Old...? Maya: She means the security lady, Ms. Oldbag, Nick. Phoenix: Right... anyway... Ms. Vasquez. You hid this incident from the press, didn't you? And you used it to control Mr. Hammer! Vasquez: ... The wind. Phoenix: The... huh? Vasquez: It's gotten stronger, don't you think? The wind. ... Your conversation interests me. Let's talk about it more inside the trailer. Maya: Nick. She went inside the trailer. Trailer Vasquez: Hmph. You came. Well then, what was that you were talking about? Phoenix: (...! Why is she so eager to talk all of a sudden?) Ms. Vasquez. You were using that accident! You were blackmailing Mr. Hammer so you could control him, weren't you? That's why he was doing kids' shows for petty change! Vasquez: Hmph... So I'm a blackmailer now? Maya: Well, that's what it was, wasn't it! I mean, sure, it was an accident... But you used it to drag Mr. Hammer down from his rightful place as a star! Vasquez: Oh...? I haven't pulled anyone down from anywhere. Mr. Hammer's career went sour of its own accord. Maya: B-but! You were the cause! You pressured him... And to think it was just an accident...! Vasquez: Excuse me! What is this all about? You keep saying \"accident,\" \"accident\"... How are you so sure? Phoenix: What do you mean? Vasquez: Must I spell everything out for you? Think: what would it be if it wasn't an accident? Phoenix: ...! No... No way! You mean Mr. Hammer did it... on purpose? Vasquez: That is what I mean. Phoenix: Wh-where's your proof! Can you prove it!? Vasquez: Hmph! Just think! Would he have let me run his life for five years... over a mere accident? And I ran him hard, believe you me! Maya: B-but, the security lady said it was an accident! Vasquez: Oh. Well, she was a big fan of Hammer's, you see. She jumped on the reporter who brought that photo into the studio. She wrenched it out of his hands, she did. Gave him a few bruises, too. Phoenix: (... So that's why she had the photo...) Vasquez: She's an old fool. Of course, all the reporter would need is the negatives. He could have made a copy. But he didn't. The only copy of that photo is the one you hold. Give it to me. Now. Maya: W-what? This is valuable evidence! Vasquez: Boys! Phoenix: ... U-umm... Who are they...? Vasquez: Professionals. They're good at erasing... various things. What do you think...? Would you like to be erased? Phoenix: Wh-what!? Vasquez: The trial ends tomorrow? How unfortunate. It's a shame you'll have to miss it! Phoenix: ... Tell me why. Why do you want this photograph so badly? This is Mr. Hammer's \"dirt\"... no? Why should Dee Vasquez care about it at all? Vasquez: ... I'm sure you'll have plenty of time to think about that where you're going. So long, friends. Boys, erase away. Maya: Nooooooooooooo! Gumshoe: Hold it right there! I heard everything, pal! Dee Vasquez! You're coming down to the precinct with me, now! Vasquez: ... Hmph. Not bad. ... Very well. It appears this contest will be decided tomorrow then. In court. I'll be looking forward to it. Gumshoe: H-hey, you okay, pal? Sorry I was a little late with my entrance. I don't get many chances to practice that sorta thing. Maya: Detective Gumshoe... Thank you thank you thank you! I was really scared... Gumshoe: Huh? Don't mention it, pal. Just doing my job. ... ... Maya: Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Sorry, it's just... I've wanted to say that line ever since I became a detective. ... Okay. I've got one more job to do today. I'm sure we'll run into each other again soon! Maya: Well, Nick. It looks like we're getting close to the bottom of this. Phoenix: (And who's at the bottom...? Dee Vasquez!) To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here.\n-- The Day of the Murder --Vasquez: I entered the trailer, oh, a little before noon.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: By yourself? Vasquez: Yes. Phoenix: And you didn't stop in at the Employee Area? Vasquez: No. Phoenix: ... Are you always this... terse? Vasquez: Yes. Phoenix: (Oh dear...)Vasquez: The meeting began at 12:00 sharp. It ended at 4:00..Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Did no one leave during the meeting? Vasquez: No one. ... Phoenix: ... C-come on... let's talk a bit more about that. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: The witness did not come here to engage in idle conversation! Stop interrupting the testimony. Vasquez: The same could be said to you, Mr. Edgeworth. And please stop banging on your little desk. It hurts my ears. Edgeworth: Mmph!Vasquez: There was to be a rehearsal afterwards, so we went to Studio One.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And when exactly was that? Vasquez: I've forgotten. Phoenix: ... Vasquez: ... Phoenix: Maybe you could try remembering? Vasquez: No. Edgeworth: The meeting ended at 4:00, and the rehearsal was scheduled for 5:00... I would think it was between those times. Phoenix: (You \"would think\"!? C'mon, all you did was state the obvious, Edgeworth!)Vasquez: I was fatigued, so I had Sal take me.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Hold on! You had Sal \"take\" you? What does that mean!? Vasquez: It means what I just said. I had Sal take me in the Studio Two van. Phoenix: (Oh... oh, right.)Vasquez: At 2:30, we took a 15-minute break in the meeting.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And what were you doing during that time...? Vasquez: Don't hit your desk. It irritates me. Edgeworth: Yeah! Mr. Wright...! Oops. Vasquez: ... It was a 15 minute break...Vasquez: Sal and I ate t-bone steaks on the table in front of the trailer.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Do you have someone who can verify this? Vasquez: Sal. Phoenix: N-no... I mean someone else? Vasquez: One person is enough. Phoenix: (If she committed murder during that break... She wouldn't have had time to eat a t-bone steak! If I had some evidence that proved she didn't eat that steak...)Present Steak Plate Phoenix: Leads to: \"Hah! As I thought!\"Maya: Well, Nick? Find anything?Phoenix: I kind of wish she'd said a little more...Maya: It's hard. I think she's pretty used to being the boss. But I'm sure you'll find some contradiction in what she said... somewhere!Phoenix: Hah! As I thought!Vasquez: ...Phoenix: You claim you ate a t-bone steak! But I say you did not!Judge: W-what's this, now, Mr. Wright?Phoenix: Look at this.Judge: It's... a plate?Phoenix: This plate was on the table in the employee room. As you can see, a large bone has been left behind.Edgeworth: Mr. Wright. Need I remind you it was a T-BONE steak!? ([steak] is all-caps in the original release)Phoenix: Exactly my point! Remember if you will... Ms. Vasquez and Mr. Manella ate at a table outside the trailer. Yet there were no bones left on the plates! The plates were bare!Vasquez: !Phoenix: Ms. Vasquez? Tell me, how can a person eat a t-bone steak... and not leave the bone? I think I know how!You ate the bone, too Phoenix: You ate the bone, too! Maya: Um, Nick... are you sure? I mean, I love steak, but even I don't eat the bone! Phoenix: Hey, I don't eat it either! Judge: Mr. Wright! I, too, leave the bone. Phoenix: Um, can I try that again? Leads back to: \"I think I know how!\"You ate a boneless steak Phoenix: Elementary! You were eating a boneless steak! Judge: ... Mr. Wright, say you are right... What would that prove? Phoenix: ... Um, right, Your Honor. Maya: Nick! Remember her testimony? She said she ate a \"t-bone steak\"! She said \"bone\"! Phoenix: Correct! I was... testing you! Maya: Yeah, sure, Nick. Phoenix: Sorry... Can I try that one more time? Judge: ... Leads back to: \"I think I know how!\"You didn't eat the steak Leads to: \"You didn't eat any steak during that break!\"Phoenix: You didn't eat any steak during that break! You took your steak and threw it somewhere... like that incinerator!Vasquez: ! ...Judge: I... I see! Then what was Ms. Vasquez doing during her break?Phoenix: Isn't it obvious, Your Honor?Meeting the Steel Samurai Leads to: \"She was meeting with the Steel Samurai!\"Picking on Sal Manella Phoenix: She was picking on Mr. Manella! Judge: Mr. Wright... Sometimes this court finds it hard to tell whether you are joking or being serious. Phoenix: Oh...? Judge: I would prefer it if you remained serious! Phoenix: Y-yes, Your Honor. I'll do my best. Leads to: \"She was meeting with the Steel Samurai!\"Phoenix: She was meeting with the Steel Samurai!Judge: Order! A-are you saying...!?Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor! As Ms. Vasquez left the trailer to eat her steak... She ran into the Steel Samurai! And then you did it. You killed him with your own hands!Vasquez: !!!Judge: M-Mr. Wright! I-isn't that a little presumptuous!?Edgeworth:Edgeworth: What kind of stunt are you trying to pull, Wright!?Vasquez: Let him claim what he wants.... You say I did it?Phoenix: Yes.Vasquez: Fascinating! And here I was worrying that today would be as boring as all the rest. ... Very well. Let us have a battle of wits, you and I.Phoenix: (Any day, Vasquez!)Maya: Good luck, Nick!Vasquez: Let's see... What was that murder weapon again? Oh yes, the \"Samurai Spear.\"Phoenix: Yes...?Vasquez: I am, as you can see, a woman of petite stature. How could I possibly use that heavy spear as a weapon?I think you could! Phoenix: It's not impossible! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Well, maybe it's not impossible, but-- Vasquez: Silence. I'm speaking. Edgeworth: Mmmph! Vasquez: The victim was stabbed through the chest from the front, yes? I believe this would indicate that the victim was aware of the killer's presence. Now, the Steel Samurai costume is quite light and mobile. Compared to the victim, I am weaker and slower... I couldn't possibly win such a fight! Not to mention, there is proof I did not have the spear! The photograph of the Steel Samurai shows that the victim himself was holding it! Or do you mean to suggest that I could have wrested it away from him? Edgeworth: Y-yeah! Take that, Wright! If you still think she did it, show us proof! Phoenix: Umm... er... Maya: Hey, Nick. Look at the data we have on that Samurai Spear in the Court Record. Isn't there something in there that gets to you...? Phoenix: Something odd about the Samurai Spear...? ... Wait! Judge: Something the matter, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: S-sorry, Your Honor. I'd like to take back my previous claim. Judge: Very well, I won't hold you to your claim. But I'm afraid I will have to penalize you. Phoenix: (Ugh...) Edgeworth: What's this? You're taking back your claim? Phoenix: Let's backtrack for a moment. I want to consider whether the witness could have used the Samurai Spear or not! Leads to: \"However, that has no bearing on this case!\"You couldn't, could you Phoenix: I think you would have a great deal of difficulty using that as a weapon. Pretty much anyone would. Vasquez: Hah. You see? Phoenix: Yes... Leads to: \"However, that has no bearing on this case!\"I don't know Phoenix: I don't know. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You \"don't know\"!? What kind of a lawyer are you!? Vasquez: Quiet. I'm speaking. Edgeworth: M-m-mmph! Vasquez: You \"don't know\"!? What kind of a lawyer... Phoenix: I don't know whether you could have fought with the Samurai Spear... Leads to: \"However, that has no bearing on this case!\"Phoenix: However, that has no bearing on this case!Vasquez: ... Meaning?Phoenix: The Samurai Spear was not the murder weapon!Vasquez: What!?Judge: What is the meaning of this!? The spear was found lying next to the victim's body!Phoenix: I have proof, Your Honor. I can prove that the Samurai Spear was not used as the murder weapon!Present Samurai Spear Phoenix: Leads to: \"I present my proof: the so-called \"murder weapon\"!\"Present anything else Phoenix: Judge: Wrong, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: But I haven't said anything yet...? Judge: I know you well enough by now to know when you're going to present the wrong evidence. Maya: I can sense it too, with my Fey blood... Phoenix: (Okay, okay, so I picked the wrong evidence! Enough with all the sensing!) Right. Okay, here's the real evidence, Your Honor. Leads back to: \"I can prove that the Samurai Spear was not used as the murder weapon!\"Phoenix: I present my proof: the so-called \"murder weapon\"!Edgeworth: B-but, that IS the murder weapon!Phoenix: Not so fast. Remember that this spear broke during the morning action scene run-through? But, someone fixed the spear. It was the security lady! She fixed it with duct tape! Now tell me, how is it possible... for someone to stab a man who is wearing a thick costume with this!? Through the chest!Judge: O-order! Order!Edgeworth: Mr. Wright! What are you driving at!? Think about what you're--Vasquez: Silence! I'm the one testifying here and I will be heard!Edgeworth: Mmmph...!Vasquez: Are you quite sane? Are you even aware of what you're saying? If the Samurai Spear was not the murder weapon, then pray tell what was!? How was Hammer killed?Judge: Well, Mr. Wright? Can you tell us what weapon was used to kill Mr. Hammer?I can tell you Leads to: \"Would I make a claim like that if I couldn't tell you what the weapon was?\"I can't tell you Phoenix: Of course I can't. Judge: \"O-of course\"!? Edgeworth: Can the antics, Wright! Judge: I have to agree, Mr. Wright. At least pretend that you think you might know! Phoenix: (Urk. Note to self: think before speaking. Tough crowd...) Leads back to: \"Well, Mr. Wright? Can you tell us what weapon was used to kill Mr. Hammer?\"Phoenix: Would I make a claim like that if I couldn't tell you what the weapon was?Judge: I'm afraid your confidence can sometimes be unfounded, Mr. Wright... Very well, let's see this murder weapon, then.Present Five-Year-Old Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"Look at this photo.\"Present anything else Phoenix: Maya: Nick! Think about this some more! Phoenix: Huh? Think? Maya: Please! How could that possibly have been the murder weapon!? Phoenix: (Hmm. She has a point.) Judge: Something the matter? Phoenix: N-no, Your Honor. Nothing! Leads back to: \"Very well, let's see this murder weapon, then.\"Phoenix: Look at this photo.Judge: W-what is this? Why, that's Jack Hammer standing at the top of the stairs! O-order! Order! If I cannot have order this trial will be suspended! Mr. Wright! What is this all about!?Phoenix: This photograph is from five years ago. There was an unfortunate accident at Global Studios. This is a photo of that very accident. Not a word of this was leaked to the outside. It was a close-kept secret at the studios.Edgeworth: What does this have to do with the current case!?Phoenix: Mr. Edgeworth... You still can't see it? See the fallen man in this photo? See how the fencepost pierced him through the chest?Edgeworth: Wh... what!? Are you saying...!?Phoenix: Yes. What happened five years ago... has happened again!Vasquez: !!!Judge: Mr. Wright! Continue!Phoenix: It's 2:30 PM on the day of the murder! Ms. Dee Vasquez meets Jack Hammer outside the Studio Two trailer! Then she did it! She pushed Mr. Hammer off the stairs onto the fence! Just like Mr. Hammer had himself done five years ago! Though whether she did it on purpose or by accident, I cannot say.Vasquez: ...!Edgeworth: I-in other words... th-the victim, Mr. Hammer... He died in the same way that he caused another man to die... five years ago!Phoenix: Precisely. Ironic, isn't it?Vasquez: ... Hoh hoh. Very creative, Mr. Wright. I could use a man like you on my script writing staff.Phoenix: You deny that what I say is true?Vasquez: ... Mr. Wright. Let's say, for the sake of argument, that Hammer died at the trailer as you say. Yet the body was found at Studio One, was it not? And in the Evil Magistrate's costume, no less. Are you then claiming that I carried the body to Studio One... And returned to the trailer all in the space of a 15 minute break? How could I have disposed of the body!?Phoenix: ...Edgeworth: The break in the meeting at the trailer lasted 15 minutes, from 2:30 to 2:45. Could Jack Hammer have been pushed off the stairs to his death... then carried to Studio One and placed inside his costume? There wasn't enough time!Judge: Hmm... indeed. Well, Mr. Wright? How could she have dealt with the body?She couldn't deal with it Phoenix: 15 minutes is kind of a short amount of time... Vasquez: You see? Even I cannot do the impossible. Therefore, Mr. Wright. I didn't do it. Agreed? Phoenix: Not agreed! Vasquez: ? Leads to: \"What if she had another way to carry the body, other than with her own hands?\"I bet she could move it Phoenix: You'd be surprised! I bet she could do it! When people think their life depends on it, they can do amazing things! Judge: Mr. Wright, this is not an episode of \"That's Incredible.\" Edgeworth: If you claim she did everything in 15 minutes... Phoenix: (Let me guess: \"Show Me Proof!\") Edgeworth: Correct! Show me proof! Phoenix: (How am I supposed to do that...?) Edgeworth: Then I won't have you making any unsubstantiated claims! Phoenix: (... Wait a second, how does he know what I'm thinking!?) Edgeworth: Hah! I need only look at the cold sweat running down your face to know what you're thinking! Judge: Mr. Wright. Perhaps you'd like to reconsider your claim? Leads back to: \"Well, Mr. Wright? How could she have dealt with the body?\"She had another way Leads to: \"What if she had another way to carry the body, other than with her own hands?\"Phoenix: What if she had another way to carry the body, other than with her own hands?Vasquez: For instance?Phoenix: Actually, for that matter, there was no need for her to do the deed in 15 minutes! And there was a way for you to carry that body.Vasquez: !!! I-interesting! Let's hear it then.Judge: Mr. Wright? Please show us how she carried the body.Present Van Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. Vasquez.\"Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Dee Vasquez used this to carry the body to Studio One! Vasquez: ... Judge: Mr. Wright... Phoenix: Your Honor? Judge: Mr. Wright, how can you carry a dead body with that? Phoenix: Umm... Judge: Please rethink your statement. Leads back to: \"Please show us how she carried the body.\"Phoenix: Ms. Vasquez. You carried the body to Studio One. And you used the studio van to do it!Vasquez: !!!Phoenix: Recall your testimony...Vasquez: There was to be a rehearsal afterwards, so we went to Studio One. I was fatigued, so I had Sal take me. There was a van there, right? I had Sal drive me.Phoenix: You used the van to carry the body to Studio One! Then, before everyone else got there, you put the body into the Magistrate costume!Vasquez: ...!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: Hold on, Wright! Don't forget, it was Sal Manella that drove the van! Are you suggesting that Mr. Manella was a conspirator?Of course he was Leads to: \"Of course, Sal Manella has to have been a conspirator!\"Of course he wasn't Phoenix: Of course he wasn't! Edgeworth: Hah! So, without Mr. Manella noticing anything, she put the body in the van... Then managed to put the body into the costume...? Are you seriously suggesting that is possible!? Phoenix: ... Of course I'm not serious. Edgeworth: Ha... hah!? Phoenix: I was kidding. To, er, lighten up the proceedings. Edgeworth: Li..light... Lighten!? Y-you can't lighten up a murder! Judge: Mr. Wright. The court requests you refrain from making claims in jest. Phoenix: Y-yes, Your Honor. Leads to: \"Of course, Sal Manella has to have been a conspirator!\"Phoenix: Of course, Sal Manella has to have been a conspirator! The body had to be placed in the van, and put into the costume. There's no way Ms. Vasquez could have done that alone! Also, don't forget that they had to dispose of the Steel Samurai costume. They had to... because it was covered in Mr. Hammer's blood! They probably burned it in that small incinerator. Well, Ms. Vasquez! Shall I continue?Vasquez: ... No need. You're smarter than you look, Mr. Wright. Hmph. I lose. You win. It... was fun.Phoenix: (I... win!?) ...Edgeworth: ...Judge: ......Phoenix: Umm... So... what happens next?Vasquez: ?Phoenix: Don't \"?\" me! Don't you have anything to say!?Vasquez: What would you like me to say?Phoenix: Huh? \"I lost\"? Something like that!Vasquez: I just said that.Phoenix: W-wait, so you mean... Dee Vasquez! So, it was you? You killed Jack Hammer! ...Edgeworth: ...Judge: ......Vasquez: Who can say?Phoenix: Huh?Vasquez: Are you sure I did? Mr. Wright... We just engaged in a battle of wits. And the result of that battle? You proved the possibility that I murdered Hammer.Phoenix: R-right!Vasquez: But... that is only a possibility. Proof is another thing altogether. You lack decisive proof, Mr. Wright.Phoenix: Wha... wha... wha... wha... WHAAAAAAAAAT!?Judge: Order! Mr. Edgeworth, your thoughts?Edgeworth: Umm... uhh... mmmph. O-of course, it's as the witness says! ... Certainly, it does seem very likely she did it... but, uh, there's no proof!Phoenix: (...! Edgeworth isn't sure!)Vasquez: ... Well? I came here as a witness today. If you've no more questions, I'll be leaving.Phoenix: (Urk! What do I do now!?)You did it, Vasquez! Phoenix: Ms. Vasquez! You did it! Vasquez: ... That wasn't a question. Phoenix: ... Um, did you do it? Vasquez: No. Judge: Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Y-yes, Your Honor? Judge: I'm not sure that question helped this court get any closer to a verdict. Leads back to: \"Urk! What do I do now!?\"Testify again, Vasquez! Phoenix: I... I'd like you to testify again! Judge: Testify... again? Vasquez: Know when to give up, Mr. Wright. Think about it. Even if I were to testify again, what's the point? I can only say what I said before. The truth, Mr. Wright. I've already said all there is to say. What would happen if I said it again? Phoenix: Uh... Vasquez: You'd ask the same questions, get the same answers. A waste of time. Leads to: \"Damn... damn!\"No further questions, Vasquez! Phoenix: ... Judge: Yes, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: I was hoping I'd come up with a question while pounding on my desk. I didn't. Judge: ... You have my sympathies. Leads to: \"Damn... damn!\"Phoenix: (Damn... damn! To come so far, only to fail...)Judge: As it seems there are no further questions... I would like to end the cross-examination of the witness, Ms. Vasquez.Edgeworth:Edgeworth: ...Judge: Yes, Mr. Edgeworth?Edgeworth: I was hoping I'd come up with a question while I was objecting, Your Honor... I didn't.Judge: I see... Very well.Edgeworth:Edgeworth: Your Honor! I request that the witness testify again!Vasquez: You are the prosecutor, are you not? Why are you badgering me? I'm your witness!Edgeworth: I... I just want to hear your testimony again.Vasquez: Does this make any sense to you, Your Honor? I don't see that we have anything to gain by repeating the last several minutes.Judge: Mr. Edgeworth... I, too, see little point in making Ms. Vasquez repeat herself. What exactly did you want her to testify about?Edgeworth: Mmmph! Well, yes, um... ... Indeed! Verily, I say... Ergo! I want to hear about what happened... after they found the body!Judge: After they found the body...? Very well. The witness will testify to the court concerning this matter.Vasquez: Hmph.Maya: Nick! Why did Edgeworth...?Phoenix: Who knows? He probably realized she did it, too.Maya: But... but! Wasn't he the one that said he always gets a guilty verdict...? After all that...Phoenix: (Edgeworth...)Witness Testimony-- After Finding the Body --Vasquez: I was with Sal and Oldbag, the security lady, when we found the body. The assistant was there, too. Only Powers was absent. I immediately called the police. Then Powers showed up. The security lady, Oldbag, was quite agitated. Pointing at Powers, saying \"he did it!\" I asked to be left out of the proceedings. I went back to the trailer to get my script and direction notes. Then I went home.Judge: Hmm... I see no issues raised by this testimony... Mr. Wright, your cross-examination.Maya: Okay, Nick, we're close, real close! She may be acting tough now... But if you put her on the spot she's sure to falter! Find the key you need and twist the truth out of her, Nick!Phoenix: Right!Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- After Finding the Body --Vasquez: I was with Sal and Oldbag, the security lady, when we found the body.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What time was that? Vasquez: We were to meet at 5:00 for the rehearsal. So I'd say it was then. Phoenix: When exactly did you and Mr. Manella arrive at the studio? Vasquez: About 10 minutes before. I wasn't stuffing any bodies into costumes, mind you. Phoenix: (Hmm...) Press harder Phoenix: Where were the other employees when you got to the studio? Vasquez: They weren't there yet. Phoenix: Well!? Then you could have put Hammer in that costume, with Sal Manella's help! Vasquez: Oh? What did I just say? Did I not just say \"I wasn't stuffing any bodies into any costumes\"...? You should try to listen to what people are saying, boy. Phoenix: (B-boy!?) Judge: The witness will continue her testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Hold back Phoenix: (I'd better leave this one be. I'm sure she'd see through anything I had to throw at her, anyway.) Leads back to cross-examinationVasquez: The assistant was there, too. Only Powers was absent.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Mr. Powers was taking a nap, correct? Vasquez: So he says. Phoenix: Did no one go to call him? Vasquez: Remember... Phoenix: Remember... what? Vasquez: There was a dead body lying in front of us. Yet you expect me to be calm? Phoenix: (You certainly seemed calm enough when I accused you of murder! *sigh*) Press harder Phoenix: Wait a second! Wouldn't that be the other way around!? Vasquez: The other way around? Phoenix: You discovered a murdered body, and one person was missing, right? Wouldn't you normally go looking for the missing person!? Judge: Hmm... I have to agree with the defense on this one. Well, Ms. Vasquez? Vasquez: Hmph. Logically speaking, perhaps. But no one there was thinking very logically, I assure you. Also. Without his Steel Samurai costume, Powers doesn't really stand out. We often left him on the bus when shooting at location. No one noticed he was missing. Phoenix: (Poor Powers...) Judge: Hmm... Well, I suppose that explains that. Very well, Ms. Vasquez. You may continue. Leads back to cross-examination Back off Phoenix: (I'll hold off. She'd just blow off anything I had to say, anyway.) Leads back to cross-examinationVasquez: I immediately called the police. Then Powers showed up.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What was everyone else doing at that time? Vasquez: No one said a thing. It was silent. Completely silent. So we stood there until Powers finally arrived on the scene. \"Sorry! Sorry I'm late!\" Then... silence. Dead silence. Phoenix: ... Edgeworth: ... Judge: ... ... Vasquez: Silent. Maya: Hey... Hey, Nick. Why's everyone so quiet? Someone should do something to lighten things up!Vasquez: The security lady, Oldbag, was quite agitated. Pointing at Powers, saying \"he did it!\"Press Phoenix: Phoenix: (Oldbag... the security lady.) Why did the security lady think Powers had done it? Vasquez: She said because she saw him going toward the studio. Phoenix: (Right... the Steel Samurai.) Press harder Phoenix: Did the detective arrest Mr. Powers based solely on the security lady's word? Vasquez: Perhaps not. She seems to have given the detective that photograph... Of course, I heard all this after the fact. Phoenix: (That photograph... meaning the one taken by the security camera.) Vasquez: She's not known for exhibiting the best sense of judgment when it comes to Hammer. Phoenix: (Hmm. I don't think there's anything in there I can use.) Leads back to cross-examination Back off Phoenix: (I'll hold back, I think. I'm sure she's already anticipated anything I could throw at her.) Leads back to cross-examinationVasquez: I asked to be left out of the proceedings.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You \"asked to be left out\"? Vasquez: Yes. It seems that everyone else was questioned. And I'm really not fond of that sort of thing. Phoenix: But, you can't decide who the police will and won't question! Vasquez: Thankfully, the studio thinks otherwise. They were nice enough to understand that, since we were in a meeting... There was no way we could be involved. Thus, they covered for us. Phoenix: (Covered for you... or covered it up for you? There must have been a lot riding on it, with all those bigwigs at the meeting... I'm sure her \"professionals\" helped convince everyone they didn't require questioning.)Vasquez: I went back to the trailer to get my script and direction notes.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The script and your direction notes? Vasquez: Yes, they're quite valuable. It wouldn't do to have them stolen. Phoenix: No, I guess not. Press harder Phoenix: Wait a second! I thought you came to Studio One for a rehearsal! Why didn't you bring your script and notes!? Vasquez: Well, I was under the impression that we wouldn't be able to rehearse anything. Phoenix: Why? Vasquez: There was a murder, after all! Who could think of rehearsing after that! Phoenix: (Oh, yeah, I guess...) Judge: Hmm... Very well. Ms. Vasquez, please continue... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Your Honor!!! I have an objection to the witness's last statement! Phoenix: (Huh...!?) Edgeworth: Think! Ms. Vasquez said she didn't bring the script because there wouldn't be a rehearsal. Don't you see what that means? She would have had to know about the murder before going to Studio One! Vasquez: ...! Judge: Order! Order! Mr. Edgeworth! Edgeworth: ... Judge: What you have just said... is a reasonable observation. However, I find it hard to understand why the prosecution would make such a move! Or are you thinking of a career change to defense!? Edgeworth: ... I... appreciate the concern, Your Honor. I will stand by my statement, however, regardless of how the court sees my role here. Now, Ms. Vasquez... Do you have an explanation? Phoenix: (I can't believe Edgeworth is helping me!) Vasquez: Hmph. So the prosecution is in cahoots with the defense? What kind of court is this? No matter. I think you misunderstood me. I had a perfectly good reason to believe there would be no rehearsal. Judge: Hmm... Very well, the witness will change her testimony to reflect this reason. Changes statement from \"Then I went home.\" to \"I knew that Hammer was injured and couldn't do any action scenes, so I left them behind.\" Back off Phoenix: (I'll hold back, I think. I'm sure she's already anticipated anything I could throw at her.) Leads back to cross-examinationVasquez: Then I went home.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you weren't questioned? Vasquez: That's correct. I find these things... distasteful. Press harder Phoenix: Thinking back to when we first began this trial... We were under the impression that there was no one in the trailer at all. Vasquez: I suppose. Phoenix: Why is that? Vasquez: Well, we were in a meeting the whole afternoon. What's the point of talking about that to the police? Phoenix: (She has got to be the least guilt-ridden guilty person I've ever met...) Leads back to cross-examination Back off Phoenix: (I'll hold back for now. I'm sure she's anticipated anything I had to say...) Leads back to cross-examinationVasquez: I knew that Hammer was injured and couldn't do any action scenes, so I left them behind.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How did you know about the injury? Vasquez: H-how did I know!? Sal. He told me. Phoenix: (Sal the director... Hm...)Present Powers's(?)

    "cot": "Alright, let's tackle this contradiction problem. The testimony in question is from Dee Vasquez, specifically testimony 7: \"I knew that Hammer was injured and couldn't do any action scenes, so I left them behind.\" The key here is that Vasquez claims she knew Jack Hammer was injured. \n\nLooking at the evidence, the Five-Year-Old Photo (evidence 17) shows an accident involving Jack Hammer. However, the critical point is that the injury Vasquez refers to in her testimony is actually Will Powers' injury from the morning run-through. The Samurai Spear (evidence 6) was broken by Powers during that run-through, which resulted in his ankle injury. This injury is why the figure in the security photo (evidence 5) was dragging his leg.\n\nVasquez's testimony states she knew Hammer was injured, but Hammer wasn't the one injured\u2014Powers was. The Five-Year-Old Photo is from a different incident and doesn't relate to the injury mentioned in the testimony. Therefore, the contradiction is that Vasquez incorrectly attributes the injury to Hammer when it was actually Powers. However, the key evidence here is the Samurai Spear (evidence 6), which ties Powers' injury to the broken spear and the security photo showing the limping figure. The Five-Year-Old Photo is a red herring here.\n\nWait, but the testimony mentions Hammer being injured. But Hammer wasn't injured; Powers was. Vasquez's knowledge of the injury (which she attributes to Hammer) is false. The real injury was Powers', proven by the Samurai Spear's repair with duct tape (evidence 6). Therefore, the contradiction is between Vasquez's claim about Hammer's injury (testimony 7) and the evidence showing Powers was the injured one (evidence 6). So the correct pair is evidence 6 and testimony 7."

Someone hit him. Hard.Me? Please. The cops should be here any minute.I'm in your hands... Should it come to that.April 20, 9:37 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3Examine evidence Attorney's Badge Back side Apollo: There's a number inscribed on the back of the badge. There are many numbers like it, but this one is mine. Proof that I'm an attorney. To tell the truth, I get a happy feeling inside just looking at it.Apollo: (Panicked... Palms sweaty... I can admit it. I'm nervous.)???: Ah, good morning!Apollo: G-Good morning, sir!Kristoph: You look tense, Justice. Wound up tight.Apollo: W-Wound up, sir? No! I'm loose! I'm fine!Kristoph: That screeching noise... Is that your voice? I suppose it's to be expected... Your first trial, and it's a homicide. I guess \"Justice\" doesn't start small, eh?Apollo: I-I'm fine! I got up at 5 AM to do my \"Chords of Steel\" voice workout! I'm fine!Kristoph: Ah, that explains it. I did detect a certain rasping quality to your screech.Apollo: ...*cough* (I overdid it again...)Kristoph: As you know, your client today is a good friend of mine. I wouldn't want to let him down... if you get my drift.Apollo: Drift gotten, sir! I-I'm all over that drift!Kristoph: As it happens, I dined with him the night of the murder. We can't let this case fall through.Apollo: Yes. Yes! I'm fine, sir!Kristoph: One more thing. Don't say you're fine quite so much. People might take you the wrong way.Apollo: *gulp*Kristoph: I'll be preparing our case. You might want to introduce yourself to the client.Apollo: My name is Apollo Justice. If it isn't clear already, I'm a new attorney. And today is my first trial. N-Not that I'm worried or anything! The defendant has been accused of... murder. My boss wants to help him out, of course... and so do I! I mean, there's no way he did it. Not him! No way!???: ...Apollo: Whoa!???: ...Apollo: Good uh, morning!???: ... Morning. It's all up to you today.Apollo: (First trial: nervous. Meeting him: cardiac arrest.)???: ...Apollo: ... (I think I'm supposed to say something... Uh... help?)???: So, you're...Apollo: Fine! I-I'm fine!???: Ah... Mr. Fine, is it?Apollo: Uh.???: I did remember you having an odd name.Apollo: (Well, we're off to a great start.) Um... Are you sure you're OK, I mean, with me????: ...Apollo: Mr. Gavin is a top-notch defense attorney. And he's your friend! So why...???: ... You'll see.Apollo: Uh????: You can do it. Be confident.Apollo: Um, I... I'm really sorry this happened to you. I mean... I mean, I...???: It's time. Shall we?Apollo: Y-Yes, sir! (...OK. I need to focus. First trial, here comes Justice!)April 20, 10:00 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge: The court is now in session.Payne: The prosecution is ready, Your Honor.Apollo: Uh, the defense is, uh, fine! I mean ready, Your Honor! (Mind going blank... Don't panic... Ack, too late!)Judge: Your name was... Mr. Justice? And this is your first trial?Apollo: Y-Yes, Your Honor! But I'm fine! Really!Judge: Are you quite sure? Your voice sounds a bit strained.Apollo: ...*cough*Judge: Ahem. Mr. Gavin?Kristoph: ...Yes, Your Honor?Judge: I was under the impression that you would be heading up this case...?Kristoph: That was my intention, yes. However... A defense attorney must always cede to his client's wishes. And my client specifically requested Mr. Justice.Judge: Well, of course he wants justice! But to entrust his case to this greenhorn... Why? I do not exaggerate when I say that you're the best defense attorney in town, Mr. Gavin.Apollo: (OK, so Gavin's got trial experience, fine. But does he have Chords of Steel!?)Judge: Then let's begin. The defendant may enter the courtroom.???: ...Judge: This is truly an unfortunate turn of events. I'm sorry we had to meet again under these circumstances. Long time no see, Mr. Wright.Phoenix: Let's put the past behind us, shall we? These days, I'm merely Phoenix Wright, piano player.Apollo: (Mr. Wright... How could this have happened?)Judge: I won't speak of it further then. If the prosecution would be so kind as to explain the charges. Mr. Payne?Payne: To think, I saw you enter this room a fresh attorney, and now I'll see you leave in chains.Phoenix: Ah, Winston Payne. Subtle as ever, I see.Payne: Ahem. The crime occurred at the Borscht Bowl Club... a Russian restaurant. The defendant, Phoenix Wright, took the victim, a customer... ...and he hit him! Wham! On the head! Smack! Killed him cold!Judge: Hmm... A customer at the restaurant, you say? And the defendant, you say he was...?Payne: The pianist for the club, it seems.Judge: Phoenix Wright... A pianist?Payne: This is the weapon that took the victim's life. A bottle of grape juice. Grape juice is apparently our defendant's drink of choice.Judge: The court accepts the deadly bottle as evidence.Deadly Bottle added to the Court Record.Examine evidence Deadly Bottle Label Apollo: Grape juice... How long has it been since I drank grape juice? Apparently, it's Mr. Wright's favorite drink. I wonder how well it goes with borscht? Bottom of bottle Apollo: The bottle is completely empty.Kristoph: Something to note, Justice. All evidence is filed in the Court Record. Make a practice of checking it frequently.Apollo: The Court Record... Right! I've heard of that!Kristoph: Use [R / RB / E] to look at the evidence so far. (Changed from [Use the Court Record Button to look at the evidence so far.] in the original release) I'm confident in your ability to handle this.Apollo: (Right, just use [R / RB / E]. Sounds like it's time for some hands-on action!) (Changed from [Right, the Court Record Button. Sounds like it's time for some hands-on action!] in the original release)Judge: So, the victim was a customer at this restaurant. But just who was this, erm, \"Shadi Smith\" fellow?Payne: We believe he was a traveler, Your Honor.Judge: A... traveler?Payne: According to his passport, he had been out of the country for a number of years. He had only returned to this country recently, though his place of residence is unclear.Judge: And he had some sort of connection with the defendant?Payne: ...That, too, is unclear at present, Your Honor. We believe they first met at the Borscht Bowl Club on the night of the crime.Judge: If they had only just met, then why murder? Perhaps the victim slighted the defendant's piano playing?Payne: That doesn't appear to have been the case. No, the motive had nothing to do with the defendant's lack of playing skill. At least not piano playing. I'll let this photo explain what I mean. As we can see, a game of poker was in progress at the scene of the crime.Judge: Wait a second! Isn't poker gambling? That's a crime in and of itself!Payne: Indeed. It appears our defendant... ...has fallen to become the basest sort of criminal!Kristoph:Kristoph: It is true that the defendant was engaged in a game of poker with the victim. Yet it was only that: a game, in the purest sense. A competition, Your Honor.Payne: A... competition?Kristoph: Yes, a test of wits, a silent clash of passions... Only the cards, their backs wreathed in blue flame, know its final outcome.Judge: ... Er, come again?Payne: The cards on the table had blue backs, Your Honor. I believe the defense was waxing poetic in an attempt to mystify those present... ...and impress women.Judge: That will be our first order of business here then: To find out more about this fatal game of cards.Phoenix: ...Judge: Very well, Defendant. You will testify to the court about the poker competition held the night of the crime.Phoenix: ...My pleasure.Apollo: (This is it, my first trial! Here goes nothing!)Witness Testimony-- The Competition --Phoenix: I am a pianist by trade... yet I can hardly play at all. My real job is to take on interested customers over at the poker table. The room where we play and the competition in there are the club's main attractions. The rules are simple: we play a game of poker using two decks of cards. That's all it is... a game. And our customers are happy.Judge: ...Hmm. A pianist who can't play piano?Payne: Better than a defense attorney who can't defend.Judge: ... Very well. The defense may begin the cross-examination.Apollo: R-Right, Your Honor! (My first cross-examination! Don't blow it!)Kristoph: Are you alright? You're sweating bullets.Apollo: Bullets...!? Where!?Kristoph: It's a figure of speech, Justice. Your voice sounds strained and raspy, too.Apollo: My brain feels strained and raspy, sir.Kristoph: You've watched me perform cross-examinations many times. Though you've never done one yourself, have you? Care for a refresher?Apollo: (What to do? Should I ask Mr. Gavin for a refresher course in cross-examination?)Refresher course, please! Apollo: (Better safe than sorry, especially this early in the game!) Yes, teach me! I know nothing! Kristoph: Indeed. Your job, Justice, is to be mindful of the Court Record and the testimony. Look for inconsistencies in the testimony with what the Court Record tells you. When you've found an inconsistency... That's when you present the conflicting evidence from the Court Record with [R / RB / E]! (Changed from [That's when you present the conflicting evidence from the Court Record!] in the original release) Apollo: But I didn't hear anything strange at all in the testimony just now... Kristoph: A good sign that you need to press the witness with [L / LB / Q] for more information. (Changed from [A good sign that you need to press the witness for more information.] in the original release) Apollo: Press... him? Kristoph: Don't let the fact that he's a remarkable man hold you back. Get more information! Apollo: (Uh... But isn't Mr. Wright my client?) Kristoph: Well? Think you can do it? Apollo: Yes! Thank you, sir! I think I can do it! Kristoph: I think you'd better, or we're going to have a problem. Just remember... Leads to: \"Find any inconsistencies, any lies in the testimony, and reveal them to the court.\"No thanks Apollo: No need for help here, sir! I think I've got this one covered! Kristoph: I think you'd better do more than think. You know it, or you do not. Apollo: (I'm fine! The Chords of Steel are ready for battle! My weapons: press and present...) Leads to: \"Find any inconsistencies, any lies in the testimony, and reveal them to the court.\"Kristoph: Find any inconsistencies, any lies in the testimony, and reveal them to the court. That is cross-examination. Learn it. Know it. Do it.Apollo: (\"Inconsistencies\"? \"Lies\"? Phoenix Wright...? As if! Phoenix Wright would never lie, and it's up to me to prove it.)Judge: The defense may begin the cross-examination.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Competition --Phoenix: I am a pianist by trade... yet I can hardly play at all.Press Apollo: Apollo: You can hardly play...? Phoenix: Oh, I play sometimes. When customers demand it. So I play them one song. That's usually all they want. Apollo: (Was that supposed to be a boast just now...) Phoenix: The title of \"pianist\" is a mask -- a respectable face I wear for the world at large. Judge: Then why are you really at the Borscht Bowl Club?Phoenix: My real job is to take on interested customers over at the poker table.Press Apollo: Apollo: They pay you just to play poker? Phoenix: That would seem to be the case. I am a professional, after all. Payne: Bah! Do I detect pride in that statement? It's just hard for an honest, hard-working member of society like me to imagine... Phoenix: Yes. Your imagination was always a bit limited, Winston. Payne: Wh-What!? Phoenix: I've played poker for seven years in that little room. And I've never. Lost. Once. Apollo: Wha--? Phoenix: You see why the customers come now? \"Defeat the undefeated poker champion\"... It's quite a draw. That is, I'm quite a draw. Apollo: Wait, you've never lost once? Not even one time!? Phoenix: As I said, I'm a professional. Apollo: (He's played poker for seven years and not lost once... Is that even possible!?)Press (after pressing third and fourth statements, before adding statement) Apollo: Apollo: They pay you just to play poker? Phoenix: That would seem to be the case.

Judge: People are not murdered over \"simple games\", Mr. Justice. Defendant. You were in the room the very moment that the crime occurred... Yet you claim no connection to the crime? Phoenix: ... Now that's strange. Judge: What's strange? Phoenix: I was testifying about the competition that night. Asking me about the crime at this point is against the rules, Your Honor. Of course, I expected to hear a cry of \"Objection!\" from the defense... Apollo: Ack! (Argh! I completely let that one slip by!) Kristoph: Don't despair yet, Justice. Apollo: S-Sir? Kristoph: Wright. There's something I'd like made clear. Namely, your connection to the case at hand. And I'd like to hear it from you. Phoenix: ... Sure, why not? Judge: Very well. The defendant will amend his testimony. Apollo: (Just one little press... ...and I've got myself a whole new testimony!) Adds statement \"I plead silence regarding the murder. But I will say I never touched the murder weapon.\"Phoenix: The room where we play and the competition in there are the club's main attractions.Press Apollo: Apollo: The room in the crime scene photo... is an attraction? Phoenix: It has quite a history, actually. The Borscht Bowl Club used to be a gathering spot for black market types back in the day. Apollo: B-Black market? Phoenix: All in the past. Things like the black market are only on the silver screen nowadays. Suffice it to say that there were a lot of deals being made under the table. Right there in that room. Judge: A smoky room, gambling hoods. You know... Just looking at this picture makes me feel \"bad\"! Phoenix: The bosses gather around the table, cutting deals, safe from the eyes of the law... Meanwhile, a goon keeps watch through the small window... I can practically picture it now. Apollo: (That window does look like it would be good for keeping a look-out but little else.) Phoenix: The room had a few other tricks to it... Though it was common knowledge to our regulars. At any rate, they come to play poker in a room steeped in history. Despite the dark past, it was all just good, clean fun.Press (after pressing second and fourth statements, before adding statement) Apollo: Apollo: The room in the crime scene photo... is an attraction?

    },
    "cot": "Okay, so I need to figure out which evidence contradicts which testimony in the given case. Let me start by reviewing the testimonies and the evidence.\n\nLooking at the testimonies, Phoenix Wright's fifth testimony states, \"I plead silence regarding the murder. But I will say I never touched the murder weapon.\" The murder weapon here is the Deadly Bottle, which is Evidence 3. The description of the Deadly Bottle mentions that it has Mr. Wright's fingerprints, but the prints are upside-down. That seems odd. If Phoenix never touched the bottle, how do his prints end up there? But maybe there's more to it. Wait, maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.\n\nAnother point to check: Testimony 3 says they use two decks of cards. The Crime Photo 1 (Evidence 2) shows cards scattered, and the Chip Photo (Evidence 6) describes the hands. The problem here might be the use of two decks. However, the testimony about two decks is correct as per the evidence. Wait, the Deadly Bottle's prints being upside-down might indicate that the bottle was held by someone else, maybe someone who took it from Wright's hand, but that's not directly a contradiction yet.\n\nWait, let's look at the Crime Photo 1 (Evidence 2). The caption mentions that the bottle is on the table. The testimony from Phoenix says he never touched the murder weapon. But the bottle has his prints. However, the prints are upside-down. If he had held the bottle normally, the prints would be right-side up. The upside-down prints could mean that he picked it up from a different angle or that someone else used his handprint. But the direct contradiction is that his prints are on the bottle, which he claims he never touched. So Evidence 3 (Deadly Bottle) contradicts Testimony 5.\n\nBut wait, the user might be looking for a different pair. Let me check again. Another possible contradiction is in the testimony about using two decks of cards (Testimony 3). The Crime Photo 2 (Evidence 7) is the victim's forehead, but that's not related. The Chip Photo (Evidence 6) shows the cards in the hands. Both the defendant and victim have a full house (three of a kind and a pair). But the problem arises with the use of two decks. The Crime Photo 1 (Evidence 2) shows cards on the floor and table. The testimony says they use two decks (red and blue). However, in the victim's hand (Evidence 9) and Wright's hand (Evidence 8), there are five cards each. If they're using two decks, there should be two aces of each suit. But in the hands, there's an Ace spade, Ace diamond, Ace club, Ace heart. That's four aces. But the Bloody Ace (Evidence 10) is the fifth ace, which would be impossible in a standard two-deck setup if each deck has one ace per suit. Wait, each deck has four aces (one per suit). Two decks would have eight aces total. But the presence of a fifth ace in the Bloody Ace might suggest that there's an extra ace, which could indicate cheating. But how does that relate to the testimonies?\n\nPhoenix's testimony 3 says they use two decks. If there's a fifth ace (Bloody Ace), that would mean that there are five aces of the same suit, which would be impossible with two standard decks. Wait, no. Each deck has one ace per suit, so two decks would have two aces per suit. For example, two Ace of Spades. But the Bloody Ace is another Ace, perhaps from a different deck. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the two decks are different colors (red and blue) but same suits. So each deck has the same four suits, but different back colors. If they use two decks, then each suit would have two aces (one from each deck). The victim's hand has Ace spade, Ace diamond (from one deck?), and the defendant has Ace club and Ace heart. The Bloody Ace is a fifth ace, which would be impossible if they only used two decks. Therefore, the presence of a fifth ace (Bloody Ace, Evidence 10) would contradict the testimony about using two decks (Testimony 3). But the Bloody Ace is Evidence 10. So that would be Evidence 10 contradicting Testimony 3. However, according to the given data, the Bloody Ace is received from a mysterious girl, and it's the missing \"fifth ace\". So if the game was supposed to use two decks, each with four aces (total eight aces), but there's a fifth ace, that would indicate an extra card, which is a contradiction. But wait, maybe the Bloody Ace is from one of the two decks. Let me check the hands again.\n\nIn Evidence 6 (Chip Photo), the victim's hand is King heart, King diamond, King spade, Ace club, Ace heart. The defendant's hand is 7 heart, 7 diamond, 7 club, Ace spade, Ace diamond. So in total, the visible aces are Ace club, Ace heart, Ace spade, Ace diamond. That's four aces. The Bloody Ace is another ace, which would be the fifth. If two decks were used, there should be two of each ace. So for example, two Ace of Spades (one from each deck). But the hands only show one of each ace. So if the Bloody Ace is another Ace (maybe Ace spade from the second deck), then that's possible. Wait, maybe there's confusion here. If two decks are used (red and blue backs), each deck has four aces. So in total, there are eight aces. If the hands have four aces from the two decks, but the Bloody Ace is one of the remaining four, then that's okay. But if the Bloody Ace is a fifth unique ace (like a fifth suit), that's impossible. But the game uses standard poker decks. So the Bloody Ace must be from one of the two decks. Therefore, the existence of the Bloody Ace doesn't contradict the two decks. Therefore, maybe this is not the contradiction.\n\nAnother angle: The testimony says they used two decks. The Crime Photo 1 (Evidence 2) shows cards on the floor and table. If the two decks are supposed to be used alternately to prevent cheating, but there's a card on the floor that's from a third deck, that would be a contradiction. But I don't see evidence of that in the Crime Photo description. The photo shows cards and a chipped scatter, but the description doesn't mention anything about the number of decks.\n\nWait, going back to the original cross-examination. When Phoenix says they use two decks, the evidence might contradict that. The key point comes when presenting the Deadly Bottle (Evidence 3) against his testimony that he never touched the murder weapon. The bottle has his fingerprints, which he claims he didn't touch. However, the prints are upside-down. That could mean that he didn't hold the bottle in the usual way, but the mere presence of his prints contradicts his statement. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (Phoenix says he never touched the murder weapon) and Evidence 3 (Deadly Bottle with his prints). However, in the game's logic, sometimes the contradiction isn't so direct. For example, the upside-down prints might indicate that someone else used the bottle, but Phoenix's statement is a lie because his prints are on it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another evidence. Let's check the Crime Photo 1 (Evidence 2). The photo shows the bottle on the table. If Phoenix says he never touched it, but the bottle is in the crime scene where he was present, maybe the positioning contradicts something. But the main contradiction would be the fingerprints.\n\nWait, in the game, when Apollo presents the Deadly Bottle during Phoenix's testimony where he says he never touched the weapon, that's the key contradiction. So the correct answer should be Evidence 3 (Deadly Bottle) against Testimony 5. But the user's answer requires only one pair. However, in the game's actual scenario, when Phoenix says he didn't touch the murder weapon, presenting the Deadly Bottle (which has his prints) is the correct contradiction. However, in the game, the actual contradiction is that the prints are upside-down, implying that the bottle was placed there in a way that Phoenix's prints would be upside-down, suggesting that he didn't hold it normally. But the game's logic might require that the evidence presented is the bottle. Therefore, the JSON answer should be {\"evidence\": 3, \"testimony\": 5}. But according to the user's provided data, the testimonies are numbered 0 to 5. Testimony 5 is the one where Phoenix says he never touched the weapon. Evidence 3 is the Deadly Bottle. So that's the pair.\n\nBut wait, in the cross-examination log, when Apollo presents the Deadly Bottle, it leads to pointing out the contradiction. So yes, the answer is Evidence 3 (Deadly Bottle) contradicts Testimony 5. Therefore, the JSON should be {\"evidence\": 3, \"testimony\": 5}. But I need to check if the user's provided data has the correct numbering. Let me confirm:\n\nTestimonies:\n\nTestimony 0: Phoenix's first statement.\n\nTestimony 5: \"I plead silence regarding the murder. But I will say I never touched the murder weapon.\" Person: Phoenix.\n\nEvidences:\n\nEvidence 3: Deadly Bottle.\n\nYes. So the correct pair is Evidence 3 and Testimony 5. But the user's answer expects the JSON in the last line. However, in the game's transcript, during the cross-examination, when Apollo presses on the fifth testimony (the added one about not touching the weapon), presenting the Deadly Bottle is the correct move. Therefore, the answer should be {\"evidence\": 3, \"testimony\": 5}."

What does that mean?Payne: It means he was holding the bottle inverted! And there can be only one reason for that! ...Yes. To brain someone with the bottle!Apollo: Auuuuuuuuuuuuuugh! M-Mr. Gavin!

The murder was reported from near the scene, by a call from the defendant's cell phone.Apollo: \"Near\" the scene...?Payne: Let's take a look at a diagram of the murder scene, shall we? The victim was murdered in a small room in a basement two floors down from ground level. Of course, cell phones can't get reception so far down. The defendant used the stairs in this hallway to go above ground... The call came from the first floor of the restaurant.Judge: I see... And this is the phone that made the call?Wright's Cell Phone added to the Court Record.Examine evidence Wright's Cell Phone Tape on battery case Apollo: Wow. The batteries are held in with a piece of tape... He should just buy a new one. Maybe he can't afford it... or he just doesn't care.Kristoph: The defendant could have just fled the scene of the crime if he so chose. Yet, he fulfilled his duty as a citizen and reported it to the authorities. And you claim he is being \"uncooperative\"...?Payne: Urk.Apollo: (Nice save, Mr. Gavin! I'd better not waste this!)Kristoph: ...I think the prosecution has toyed with our client enough for the time being.Payne: T-Toyed? I assure you, no one is more serious about...Kristoph: What was it you said? The defendant was \"in the room the very moment that the crime occurred\". How can you possibly know this?Judge: That's a good question! How indeed!Kristoph: The answer is simple, Your Honor. The prosecution has a decisive witness.Payne: Hee hee hee. You're as good as they say you are.Apollo: (So someone else was in the room the night of the crime! That must mean they witnessed the crime...)Kristoph: Everything up till now has been a warm-up, Justice. Are you ready?Judge: Very well. The prosecution may call its first witness to the stand!Payne: The witness will state her name and profession.Judge: H-Hold on just a moment! Where's the witness?Payne: I surmise that she has been frightened by the defense's demonic-looking horns.Apollo: (So I used a little hair gel! Relax, people!)Judge: Have no fear! If any horns point in your direction this court will cut them off.???: ... You... are sure?Judge: I swear it on my gavel! Please, come out.Apollo: Isn't violence against hair a crime, Your Honor????: Well, if you are sure it is OK...Judge: Ahem. Now, the prosecution... W-W-Wait a minute! Would the prosecution care to explain the witness's... erm... paraphernalia?Payne: Er... yes. She is a professional, Your Honor. Those are merely the tools of her trade.Judge: And that would be...?Olga: My name... is Olga Orly. I am employed as waitress in Borscht Bowl Club restaurant.Judge: Then... why the camera?Olga: Of course, it is my pride to serve borscht that is naming restaurant. But I also perform -- how it is said? Other service.Judge: I take it one of these other services is taking the customers' pictures?Olga: Dah, dah. Like, for example... this one.Judge: Th-That's... the defendant!?Payne: Indeed. On the night of the murder.Olga: Man in white hat... is one who has gone kaput.Judge: Indeed... That is the victim.

Then the court will casually accept this new evidence.Olga's Photo added to the Court Record.Payne: Now, witness. Where were you at the time of the murder?Olga: I was in room. The Hydeout, we call it.Apollo: Excuse me? The Hydeout?Olga: It is room where famous gangster \"Badgai\" was arrested. Is room where murder took place.Apollo: Whaaaaat!?Olga: Your look of utter surprise... It is lovely. I will post by courtroom door later for you! Dah, dah, photos will be numbered, and you will write which ones you want copy of.Apollo: (So there were three people in the room at the time of the crime... The victim, Shadi Smith, Mr. Wright, and... ...Olga Orly, our witness! ...And if Mr. Wright isn't the killer, that means...!)Judge: Very well. Witness!

Both players played with hats on, dah. The victim, he plays whole time with his hand on locket at his neck. Then, last hand is done! But something terrible has happened, dah! That man flew at victim, and is strangling him to death!Judge: Hmm... Incidentally, who won the game?Payne: Isn't it obvious? The winner was the victim... Mr. Smith!Apollo:Apollo: That's ridiculous! Um, because... Because Mr. Wright can't lose!Kristoph: Ahem. Justice? Maybe you can come up with a more legitimate objection?Apollo: But! He hadn't lost in seven years!Payne: Take it from me kid. It happens. I didn't lose a case my first seven years as prosecutor, either. Incidentally. I have some evidence here. These are the poker chips as they lay the very moment of the crime. The hand and chips on this side belong to the defendant, Mr. Wright. Those on the far side belonged to the victim, Mr. Smith.Judge: Chips... you say?Payne: Dah. I mean yes! Imagine that poker is war... Your hand is your army, and the chips are the spoils.Judge: I-I know that. After all, in my youth I was known as... ...the \"Poker Head of Courtroom No. 3\"!Apollo: (I think he means \"poker face\"...)Judge: Hmm... Looking at this picture... ...it does seem that most of the chips are on the victim's side of the table.Chips Photo added to the Court Record. (Changed from [Chip Photo added to the Court Record.] in the original release)Judge: Very well. The defense may cross-examine the witness.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- That Fateful Night --Olga: That night, customer asked me to deal cards for game.Press Apollo: Apollo: You were dealing cards... Do you do this often? Olga: Dah, I am doing this. If customer wishes it, I serve anything. Borscht, cards, more borscht... It is my work. Judge: It's good to hear of a place that hasn't forgotten the meaning of service! Olga: Welcome you to Borscht Bowl Club, where borscht is as warm as the waitresses! Apollo: Thank you for NOT handing out flyers during the cross-examination.Olga: It was cold... Both players played with hats on, dah.Press Apollo: Apollo: It's already April. How could it be cold? Olga: At Borscht Bowl Club we have pride on authentic rustic Russian restaurant theme. Outside it is city in Spring, but inside it is always as cold as Mother Russia! Apollo: (No way am I going there.) Olga: When it comes to hot borscht, cold is best seasoning, dah?Olga: The victim, he plays whole time with his hand on locket at his neck.Press Apollo: Apollo: His \"locket\"...? Olga: I believe it was good-luck charm, dah? He gripped it many times as he played that night. Judge: Yes, he must have felt as though it might carry him to the moon and the stars! Though if it were small enough to fit around his neck, it wouldn't have much lift... Apollo: Um... The defense would like a clarification: this is a locket we're talking about? I mean, a pendant with a picture in it, right? Not a \"rocket\"? Judge: Of course! I knew that! It was probably a pendant shaped like a rocket. That's why she called it that. Apollo: No, a locket's a locket! It doesn't matter what shape it is. Kristoph: It's considered bad form to poke fun at the hard-of-hearing in our society. Apollo: (Hard of hearing, or hard of understanding?) Payne: So, what happened next?Present Crime Photo 2 Apollo: Leads to: \"You know, there was one curious part in her testimony just like Mr. Gavin said.\"Olga: Then, last hand is done! But something terrible has happened, dah!Press Apollo: Apollo: Something terrible!?!? Olga: Eeeeeeeeeeeek! Judge: The defense will refrain from needless shouting! Apollo: Er, sorry. (I need to seriously reconsider this vocal training thing...) Payne: Now, Ms. Orly, can you tell us what happened? Olga: Oh, I was so frightened! Dah, I trembled with fear!Olga: That man flew at victim, and is strangling him to death!Press Apollo: Apollo: But the defendant would never do such a thing! Olga: Eeeeeeeek! Judge: Well now, I can't say I've ever heard the defense try this tactic. Kristoph: If possible... Please... Refrain from embarrassing me. Judge: Still... Why would anyone do something like this over a game of poker? Olga: Perhaps it is because defendant has lost game? Payne: Yes! A crushing defeat for a man undefeated! So it always is with men like him. Winners make sore losers. Oh, how the mighty fall!Present Smith's Autopsy Report Apollo: Apollo: Oh really? \"Strangled\", you say? That's odd. Olga: Dah, normal customers only choke on borscht. Apollo: No, I mean this report shows that the victim died of a blow to the head! Olga: Aaack! Apollo: Ms. Orly! Really now... Did you witness the crime!? Olga: Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek! Judge: Hmm... Looking at the picture, it doesn't seem like he was hit. He's still wearing his hat and everything. Payne: Yet, it is a fact that he was hit, Your Honor. Here's a photo we took of the victim with his hat off during our investigation. Judge: Well, that's quite shocking, isn't it? This head certainly was hit. Crime Photo 2 added to the Court Record. Olga: B-But...! I have seen it happen! The defendant, he lunge at victim, his neck... Apollo: (Oh really, Ms. Orly? I think I've caught you in your own lie this time!) Kristoph: ...Justice. I admire your enthusiasm, but perhaps you should think this through once more. Apollo: Wh- What do you mean? I found a contradiction! Kristoph: There's one thing in her testimony that... troubles me. Judge: Very well. It seems we should continue the cross-examination. Apollo: (There's such a thing as thinking too much... This horse is dead, let's stop beating it!) Kristoph: There's such a thing as thinking aloud too much, too. Changes statement from \"That man flew at victim, and is strangling him to death!\" to \"After defendant tried to strangle victim, he hit him with bottle.\"Olga: After defendant tried to strangle victim, he hit him with bottle.Press Apollo: Apollo: You didn't say anything about hitting before! Olga: S-S-S-S-So sorry! I must be forgetting this, dah! Judge: Witness! You will take greater care with your testimony. Olga: Oh dah, dah. I'm sorry, Your Honor. Payne: And that clears up the discrepancy with the autopsy report, I believe. The defendant made to strangle his victim, then changed his mind... ...and chose a simpler, blunter means to do the job. Yes, that sums it up nicely. Apollo: (So he strangled him, then hit him...? Something's fishy about all this...)Kristoph: Go ahead. I believe you know what it is you need to do.Apollo: Right, sir! Leave it to me! (There were only three people in the room at the time of the murder. The victim, Shadi Smith, Mr. Wright, and... And if Mr. Wright isn't the killer...

    "cot": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let's go through the testimonies and evidences one by one.\n\nThe testimonies are from Olga Orly. Testimony 4 initially says that the defendant strangled the victim to death. But after pressing, it changes to testimony 5, stating that after trying to strangle, he hit him with the bottle. However, the problem might be elsewhere. Let me check the other testimonies.\n\nLooking at testimony 3: \"Then, last hand is done! But something terrible has happened, dah!\" And the evidence related to this. The Crime Photo 2 shows the victim's forehead injury, which is the cause of death according to the autopsy. But Olga's testimony in testimony 3 claims something terrible happened when the last hand was done. However, the key contradiction might be between the chips photo (Evidence 6) and her statement about the game's outcome. \n\nWait, the victim's hand and the defendant's hand both are full houses. But according to poker rules, two full houses can't be in the same game with two decks. Wait, but they used two decks. Oh, but each deck has one Ace of each suit. So if both players have three of a kind plus a pair, but with the same ranks, that's possible? Wait, in standard poker, a full house is three of one rank and two of another. For example, three Kings and two Aces. So if the defendant has three 7s and two Aces, and the victim has three Kings and two Aces, then both have full houses. But the victim's would be higher (Kings over 7s). So the victim would win. But Phoenix claims he never lost. But according to the chip photo, the victim has more chips, implying he won. So that contradicts Phoenix's statement of never losing. But that's part of his testimony, not Olga's. However, in Olga's testimony, she says the last hand is done and something happened. The contradiction here might be between the hands in the chip photo (both full houses) and the fact that two full houses of different ranks can't exist with the same two decks. Wait, they used two decks, red and blue. So each deck has 52 cards. So two decks would have 104 cards. But if they were using two different colored decks, maybe they can have duplicate ranks but different colors. Wait, but in poker, suits don't matter except for flush. So if they're using two decks, but the red and blue decks, then there would be two of each card (one red, one blue). So for example, two Aces of spades (one red, one blue). But in the defendant's hand, he has 7 heart, 7 diamond, 7 club, Ace spade, Ace diamond. The victim has King heart, King diamond, King spade, Ace club, Ace heart. Wait, in a standard game, you can't have five of the same rank. But with two decks, maybe? But each deck only has one of each card. So two decks would have two of each card. But if they're using two decks, then it's possible. So each player's hand uses different decks. For example, the defendant's 7s and Aces could be from different decks. Similarly for the victim's Kings and Aces. So the defendant's hand is 7s full of Aces, and the victim's is Kings full of Aces. The victim's hand is higher, so he wins. But Phoenix claims he never lost. So the contradiction is between Phoenix's testimony (never lost) and the chip photo showing the victim's higher hand. But that's Phoenix's testimony, not Olga's. But the question is about Olga's testimony contradicting evidence.\n\nWait, the problem is Olga's testimony that the last hand was done and then the murder happened. But according to the chip photo, the hands are both full houses. If the game ended, the victim would have won, which would contradict Phoenix's claim of never losing. But Olga's testimony is about the events after the hand, not the outcome. So maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.\n\nAnother angle: The victim's hand and the defendant's hand both have two Aces each. But each deck only has one Ace per suit. So if they're using two decks (red and blue), then there are two Aces of each suit. So in total, eight Aces (four suits, two each). But in their hands, the defendant has Ace spade and Ace diamond (assuming those are from different decks), and the victim has Ace club and Ace heart. So that's four Aces. But the problem comes with the Bloody Ace (Evidence 10), which is the missing fifth Ace. Wait, but the Bloody Ace is a different evidence. The hands each have two Aces. But if both players have two Aces each, that's four Aces. But with two decks, there are eight Aces. So no problem. Unless the Bloody Ace is an extra Ace, but that's a different point.\n\nWait, maybe the contradiction is in Olga's testimony 4 (original) where she says the defendant strangled the victim, but the autopsy says death was from a blow to the head. But after pressing, the testimony changes to include the bottle. But after that, the contradiction is resolved. So maybe the initial contradiction is between testimony 4 and the autopsy (Evidence 1). But the problem is that the user is asking for the pair of evidence and testimony that contradict, so the original testimony 4 (strangling) contradicts the autopsy report (blow to head). But in the cross-examination, when the autopsy is presented, the testimony is updated. But the initial testimony 4 (strangling) would contradict the autopsy (Evidence 1). However, in the given testimonies, after cross-examination, the testimony 4 is changed to 5. So maybe the user is referring to the original testimony 3: \"Then, last hand is done! But something terrible has happened, dah!\" And the contradiction is with the hands shown in the Chip Photo (Evidence 6), which both have full houses. But how does that contradict?\n\nAlternatively, the contradiction could be between Olga's testimony 3 (\"last hand is done\") and the fact that both players had full houses. In a normal poker game, there can't be two full houses of the same rank. Wait, no. If one player has three Kings and two Aces, and the other has three 7s and two Aces, then the first player wins. But the hands are possible. So that's not a contradiction. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the issue is that in the game, there's supposed to be only one winner. But if both players have full houses, but one is higher, then the victim would have won, contradicting Phoenix's claim. But the problem is Olga's testimony, not Phoenix's. So the contradiction would be between Olga's testimony that the last hand was done (implying a conclusion) and the fact that both players had full houses, which would mean the game had a winner (the victim), but Phoenix's statement that he never lost. But again, Phoenix's statement is his own testimony, not Olga's. So perhaps the contradiction is between Olga's testimony 3 (something terrible happened after the last hand) and the chip photo showing that the game was still in progress. Wait, but the chip photo is from the moment of the crime. If the game was done, the hands would be shown, but the chips would be pushed to the winner. In the photo, the chips are still on each player's side. So if the game was done, the chips would be collected by the winner. Therefore, the fact that the chips are still on both sides (with the victim having more) might imply the game wasn't over yet. But Olga's testimony says the last hand was done. Therefore, the contradiction is between testimony 3 (last hand done) and the chip photo showing the game wasn't concluded (chips not collected). But how to connect that. Alternatively, the hands themselves: both players have a full house. In standard poker, that's possible, but only if they have different ranks. So in this case, the victim's hand is higher (Kings vs. 7s), so he would have won. But according to Phoenix's claim, he never lost. So the contradiction would be between Phoenix's testimony and the chip photo. But the question is about Olga's testimony and evidence. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the contradiction is between Olga's testimony that the last hand was done and the presence of cards on the floor (as seen in Crime Photo 1). If the hand was done, the cards would be collected, but they are scattered. But that's speculative.\n\nWait, looking at Evidence 6: the Chip Photo shows the defendant's hand as 7 heart, 7 diamond, 7 club, Ace spade, Ace diamond. Victim's hand is King heart, King diamond, King spade, Ace club, Ace heart. Both are full houses. So the victim's hand is higher (three Kings beats three 7s), so he should have won. But Phoenix claims he never lost. So the contradiction is between Phoenix's testimony (never lost) and the chip photo (victim's higher hand). But that's Phoenix's own testimony, not Olga's. However, the user is asking for a contradiction between evidence and testimony. The testimony in question would be Phoenix's, but the problem is Olga's testimony. \n\nWait, the user provided the list of testimonies. Let's check the testimonies again. Olga's testimonies include:\n\nTestimony 3: Then, last hand is done! But something terrible has happened, dah!\n\nTestimony 5: After defendant tried to strangle victim, he hit him with bottle.\n\nThe relevant evidence could be the Autopsy Report (1) which states death was from a blow to the head, not strangling. So when Olga initially said the defendant strangled the victim (testimony 4), that contradicts the autopsy (Evidence 1). But after presenting the autopsy report, the testimony changes to include the bottle hit. So the contradiction here is between testimony 4 and Evidence 1. But in the given data, after pressing, the testimony is updated. So the original testimony 4 (strangling) contradicts the autopsy report.\n\nBut according to the problem, the answer should be a pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other. So the correct answer would be Smith's Autopsy Report (Evidence 1) and Testimony 4 (original testimony about strangling). But in the given options, the testimonies are numbered 0-5, with testimony 4 being the original \"strangling\" and testimony 5 the amended one. So the contradiction is between testimony 4 (strangling) and Evidence 1 (autopsy report says blunt force). So the answer would be {\"evidence\": 1, \"testimony\":4}.\n\nBut wait, in the cross-examination, when Apollo presents the autopsy report against testimony 4, the testimony changes. So that's the contradiction. Therefore, the correct pair is Evidence 1 (autopsy) and Testimony 4."

Judge: It's good to hear of a place that hasn't forgotten the meaning of service! Olga: Welcome you to Borscht Bowl Club, where borscht is as warm as the waitresses! Apollo: Thank you for NOT handing out flyers during the cross-examination.Olga: It was cold... Both players played with hats on, dah.Press Apollo: Apollo: It's already April. How could it be cold? Olga: At Borscht Bowl Club we have pride on authentic rustic Russian restaurant theme. Outside it is city in Spring, but inside it is always as cold as Mother Russia! Apollo: (No way am I going there.) Olga: When it comes to hot borscht, cold is best seasoning, dah?Olga: The victim, he plays whole time with his hand on locket at his neck.Press Apollo: Apollo: His \"locket\"...? Olga: I believe it was good-luck charm, dah? He gripped it many times as he played that night. Judge: Yes, he must have felt as though it might carry him to the moon and the stars! Though if it were small enough to fit around his neck, it wouldn't have much lift... Apollo: Um... The defense would like a clarification: this is a locket we're talking about? I mean, a pendant with a picture in it, right? Not a \"rocket\"? Judge: Of course! I knew that! It was probably a pendant shaped like a rocket. That's why she called it that. Apollo: No, a locket's a locket! It doesn't matter what shape it is. Kristoph: It's considered bad form to poke fun at the hard-of-hearing in our society. Apollo: (Hard of hearing, or hard of understanding?) Payne: So, what happened next?Present Crime Photo 2 Apollo: Leads to: \"You know, there was one curious part in her testimony just like Mr. Gavin said.\"Olga: Then, last hand is done! But something terrible has happened, dah!Press Apollo: Apollo: Something terrible!?!? Olga: Eeeeeeeeeeeek! Judge: The defense will refrain from needless shouting! Apollo: Er, sorry. (I need to seriously reconsider this vocal training thing...) Payne: Now, Ms. Orly, can you tell us what happened? Olga: Oh, I was so frightened! Dah, I trembled with fear!Olga: That man flew at victim, and is strangling him to death!Press Apollo: Apollo: But the defendant would never do such a thing! Olga: Eeeeeeeek! Judge: Well now, I can't say I've ever heard the defense try this tactic. Kristoph: If possible... Please... Refrain from embarrassing me. Judge: Still... Why would anyone do something like this over a game of poker? Olga: Perhaps it is because defendant has lost game? Payne: Yes! A crushing defeat for a man undefeated! So it always is with men like him. Winners make sore losers. Oh, how the mighty fall!Present Smith's Autopsy Report Apollo: Apollo: Oh really? \"Strangled\", you say? That's odd. Olga: Dah, normal customers only choke on borscht. Apollo: No, I mean this report shows that the victim died of a blow to the head! Olga: Aaack! Apollo: Ms. Orly! Really now... Did you witness the crime!? Olga: Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek! Judge: Hmm... Looking at the picture, it doesn't seem like he was hit. He's still wearing his hat and everything. Payne: Yet, it is a fact that he was hit, Your Honor. Here's a photo we took of the victim with his hat off during our investigation. Judge: Well, that's quite shocking, isn't it? This head certainly was hit. Crime Photo 2 added to the Court Record. Olga: B-But...! I have seen it happen! The defendant, he lunge at victim, his neck... Apollo: (Oh really, Ms. Orly? I think I've caught you in your own lie this time!) Kristoph: ...Justice. I admire your enthusiasm, but perhaps you should think this through once more. Apollo: Wh- What do you mean? I found a contradiction! Kristoph: There's one thing in her testimony that... troubles me. Judge: Very well. It seems we should continue the cross-examination. Apollo: (There's such a thing as thinking too much... This horse is dead, let's stop beating it!) Kristoph: There's such a thing as thinking aloud too much, too.

Olga: S-S-S-S-So sorry! I must be forgetting this, dah! Judge: Witness! You will take greater care with your testimony. Olga: Oh dah, dah. I'm sorry, Your Honor. Payne: And that clears up the discrepancy with the autopsy report, I believe. The defendant made to strangle his victim, then changed his mind... ...and chose a simpler, blunter means to do the job. Yes, that sums it up nicely. Apollo: (So he strangled him, then hit him...? Something's fishy about all this...)Kristoph: Go ahead. I believe you know what it is you need to do.Apollo: Right, sir! Leave it to me! (There were only three people in the room at the time of the murder. The victim, Shadi Smith, Mr. Wright, and... And if Mr. Wright isn't the killer... I've got you now, Orly!)Apollo: (You know, there was one curious part in her testimony just like Mr. Gavin said. But what does it mean?)Judge: Mr. Justice, would you care to explain what it is you're thinking so intensely about?Apollo: Recall the testimony, Your Honor...

Do you see a locket on the victim's neck?Kristoph: Well done, Justice. I'm impressed. I knew you'd be able to handle this.Apollo: B-But what does it mean?Judge: If we are to believe this witness's testimony as-is... Then the locket \"disappeared\" following the victim's death.Apollo: Lockets don't just \"disappear\", Your Honor!Kristoph: It's quite simple when you think about it. If the locket is gone, someone must have taken it off, no?Apollo: Taken it off... Wait, you don't mean...!Kristoph: The defendant wasn't strangling the victim at all. He was taking off his locket! ...Wouldn't that explain it?Judge: Ah...!Payne: Urk...?Judge: D-Defendant! What do you have to say to this?Phoenix: ...Judge: ...

Why don't I buy that this is just a coincidence...?)Judge: Well now, if the results of this poker game led to the murder...

Failure must have been a bitter pill to swallow!Judge: Ah, how many times have I heard these words: \"I done it in a fit of anger, Yer Honor, and now I regret what I done\". ...A common tale, but true.Apollo: (Methinks the judge watches too many old court movies. Mr. Wright said he hasn't lost in seven years, so this testimony must be wrong!)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Serious Competition --Olga: The game began with 3,500 point in chips for each man.Press Apollo: Apollo: Are those the usual starting points? Were any special rules used...? Olga: No, not special. Usual game, usual rules. Judge: If each man began with 3,500 points, then the total would be... Um... Exactly six, no, 7,000 points!

What is there to be explained? Payne: Payne: Poker chips are poker chips. They're not fish and chips, not a chip off the old block, not a motorcycle cop, not a... Apollo: ...Thanks. (Now that I've pressed her I'd better ask something...) What are these chips worth? Are they in dollars? Or rubles, even? Olga: ...Nyet. As I have been saying before, it was game, not gambling. Hard perhaps for capitalist to understand. Two types of chip: 100 points chip and 1,000 points chip. It is not money, dah. Kristoph: ...Justice. Apollo: Sir! Kristoph: Don't you find her comment... interesting? Apollo: In more ways than one, sir. Kristoph: I'd have it added to her testimony, myself. Judge: Well? Does the defense want the witness to add to her testimony? Add to testimony Apollo: Yes, I do think this deserves further scrutiny. Add it to the testimony!

Judge: Is that all? Apollo: Um... Yeah. *gulp* (Great. Mr. Gavin made me stop her, and now I'm the one who looks dumb.) Kristoph: Oh, Justice? Please try not to embarrass me like that. Apollo: Huh?

Judge: It appears that both the defendant and the victim's hands are in this picture. That is truly an excellent hand. However, so is the victim's... Olga: One with highest number wins, so defendant loses. Payne: The victim, Mr. Smith, had a stronger hand than the defendant and crushed him. I believe that explains what occurred next.

How could such thing occur!? Apollo: What \"such thing\"!? Olga: ...Ny-Nyet! ...Nyet, nyet, nyet! The defendant had been hitting v-victim!!! Dah, I saw it all happen, right before me...

The victim's side has 2 small red chips (2*100=200) and 9 big gray chips (9*1000=9000). Total is 9200. \n\nEach started with 3500, so total chips in play should be 7000. But the victim's 9200 plus defendant's 1400 is 10600, which is way more than 7000. That's impossible. So Olga's testimony that the victim was winning is a contradiction because the total chips exceed the initial amount. Therefore, the victim couldn't have accumulated 9200 if they started with 3500 each. So the contradiction is between Evidence 6 (Chip Photo) and Testimony 3 (the victim was winning)."

Olga: Da... Dah! Of course. Apollo: ...? (Something's fishy with these chips. Should I press harder?) Press harder Apollo: Maybe you could explain a bit about these \"chips\"? Olga: E-Explain? What is there to be explained? Payne: Payne: Poker chips are poker chips. They're not fish and chips, not a chip off the old block, not a motorcycle cop, not a... Apollo: ...Thanks. (Now that I've pressed her I'd better ask something...) What are these chips worth? Are they in dollars? Or rubles, even? Olga: ...Nyet. As I have been saying before, it was game, not gambling. Hard perhaps for capitalist to understand. Two types of chip: 100 points chip and 1,000 points chip. It is not money, dah. Kristoph: ...Justice. Apollo: Sir! Kristoph: Don't you find her comment... interesting? Apollo: In more ways than one, sir. Kristoph: I'd have it added to her testimony, myself. Judge: Well? Does the defense want the witness to add to her testimony? Add to testimony Apollo: Yes, I do think this deserves further scrutiny. Add it to the testimony! (I wish I knew where I was going with this...) Judge: Very well. Witness, if you would be so kind? Olga: D-Dah, Your Honor. Changes statement from \"House chips come in two size: small and large.\" to \"One kind of chip is worth 100 points, other kind is worth 1,000. Two kinds in all.\" No need Kristoph: Very well... It's your trial, after all. Apollo: (Way to fill me with confidence...) Judge: Very well. The witness will resume her testimony! Olga: Dah, Your Honor. Leads back to cross-examination No need Apollo: (...Nah. ...It's her nature to be jumpy and suspicious-looking.) Leads back to cross-examinationOlga: One kind of chip is worth 100 points, other kind is worth 1,000. Two kinds in all.Press Apollo: Apollo: (Mr. Gavin said this testimony is important! ...To be honest, I have no idea why.) Judge: ...Mr. Justice? Do the court a favor and think of what you want to say before raising your hand. We are not in kindergarten. Apollo: Ack! Sorry! I'm fine! (I'd better think of something to ask... and quick!) Um... The two types of chips... Olga: Dah...? Apollo: Um. The small ones are 100, and the big ones 1,000... Uh? Right? Right. Of course. Payne: Hah! Don't waste our time! Apollo: *sigh* ... Judge: Is that all? Apollo: Um... Yeah. *gulp* (Great. Mr. Gavin made me stop her, and now I'm the one who looks dumb.) Kristoph: Oh, Justice? Please try not to embarrass me like that. Apollo: Huh? Who? Me!? Kristoph: There's a clear contradiction in the information you have in your hands. Apollo: (What...!?) Kristoph: It's a simple matter of calculation. Go on, try it. We're not in kindergarten, after all. Apollo: (\"Calculation\"...?)Present Chip Photo Apollo: Leads to: \"You're sure it was the victim who won?\"Olga: The one who was winning... dah, it was victim!Press Apollo: Apollo: You're telling me that Mr. Wright, undefeated for seven whole years, was losing? Olga: Dah. It must have been most unlucky day for him. I am glad I did not take other picture of him. It would break camera, certainly. The chips, they went always to victim's side of table. Payne: So you're telling us it was a one-sided game? Olga: Dah. One-sided, and...Present Chip Photo (after changing second statement) Apollo: Leads to: \"You're sure it was the victim who won?\"Olga: For last hand, defendant play with all chips on table and lose.Press Apollo: Apollo: \"Last hand\"? Olga: It was largest points of any hand. The defendant's hand, it was excellent. He try to use it to take victory from behind. Judge: It appears that both the defendant and the victim's hands are in this picture. That is truly an excellent hand. However, so is the victim's... Olga: One with highest number wins, so defendant loses. Payne: The victim, Mr. Smith, had a stronger hand than the defendant and crushed him. I believe that explains what occurred next. Olga: Once cards laid down on table, it happened...Olga: The moment loss was decided, defendant grabs bottle from table and...Press Apollo: Apollo: And...? What happened next!? Olga: ...Even to think of it now, I shake and tremble, dah! I did not believe such thing would happen! Apollo: What \"such thing\"!? Olga: Please, you must believe! I had no idea... How could such thing occur!? Apollo: What \"such thing\"!? Olga: ...Ny-Nyet! ...Nyet, nyet, nyet! The defendant had been hitting v-victim!!! Dah, I saw it all happen, right before me... I saw bottle coming down on victim's head! Payne: Decisive, isn't it, Your Honor? My witness saw the very moment of the crime! Judge: Hmm...Kristoph: Remember, your first goal is to gather information!Apollo: Yes, sir! (Look out contradiction, here comes Justice!)Apollo: You're sure it was the victim who won? Absolutely sure?Olga: ...!Payne:Payne: It seems our new attorney is a bit confused... A glance at the picture is enough to tell you who won! If you're not in kindergarten.Judge: Um... Just for safety's sake, could you explain the problem to the court?Apollo: Of course, Your Honor. In this photo I see small chips and I see large chips. Tell me.. which were worth 1,000 points?Payne: Why, the big ones of course! Duh!Apollo: Oh, I thought so too... but then the totals don't add up.Payne: Th-The totals...?Apollo: Let's review what the witness told us: Each man started with 3,500 points in chips. And the combined total value of the chips was 7,000 points.Judge: Yes... if my calculations are correct! Let's see, three plus one, carry the five...Apollo: Um, they are, Your Honor. Now! Look at this photo that allegedly shows all the chips. If the big chips are worth 1,000 points, and the small chips are worth 100... And you add them up...Payne: How much is it!?Apollo: (Do it yourself... You aren't in kindergarten, are you?) ...10,600 points. The chips don't add up! This clearly contradicts the witness's testimony!Payne: B-But why!? How could this be!?Kristoph: Exactly... Justice. Now that you know the \"what\", you must determine the \"why\".Apollo: (Right... There's only one possible way to explain this contradiction!)Starting points were wrong Apollo: This calculation makes the answer clear! If the total combined points at the table was 10,600... Then each man started the night with 5,300 points! Judge: Five thousand three hundred... That's a rather half-baked score at which to start a game. Kristoph: Justice... Would different starting points really change anything? Apollo: Eh? Judge: It seems the defense's objection was even more half-baked than the score! Apollo: (Uh oh... Time to head back into the kitchen!) Leads back to: \"Right... There's only one possible way to explain this contradiction!)\"Chip count was wrong Apollo: The odd thing here is the number of chips... Right, Mr. Gavin? Kristoph: ...Why are you asking me? Apollo: Uh... Just in case? Kristoph: Justice... It's your case I'm concerned about. If you're wondering about the chips, just look at the photograph. It's all there. Even our judge with his failing eyesight could count them. Apollo: (That's not the only thing failing the judge.) Judge: ...Let me ask you again. Leads back to: \"Right... There's only one possible way to explain this contradiction!)\"Both were right Leads to: \"Each man began the game with 3,500 points.\"Apollo: Each man began the game with 3,500 points. If all the chips are indeed shown in this photograph... Then there can be only one answer.Judge:  Well, what is it?Apollo: The value of the chips... was the other way around!Payne: Wh-What!?Apollo: Want to know what I think? The small chips were worth 1,000 points, not the big ones!Payne: Madness! Utter madness!Judge: Show me that photograph of the chips again! ...There are six small chips, and ten large chips... Why, that does make 7,000 points when you add them up!Kristoph: Excellent work, Justice. It's almost as though you figured it out by yourself.Apollo: Well... I'm just glad I was the one who said it.Payne:Payne: B-But wait! The value of the chips may be different, but that changes nothing!!!Judge: Indeed.. The victim did have the larger number of chips still. ... Ah!Apollo: ...Exactly. If the small chips are 1,000 points, and the large chips are 100... Let's do a little math. Add up the points for each side of the table!Payne: Ah... Auuuuuuuuuuuuugh!Judge: The victim, Mr. Smith, had 2,900 points, and the defendant had... 4,100 points!Apollo: Well now... It seems that Mr. Wright was winning that night after all!Payne: That's... impossible!Apollo: My client had even less reason to kill the victim! After all... he was winning!Payne: Yeeeaaaargh!Apollo: Now... Ms. Orly. You must have known the true value of the chips. Since you were there at the scene of the crime... weren't you?Olga: Ah... Eeeeeeeeeek!Judge: Order! Order!!! It appears our defendant has lost his \"motive\". And Mr. Wright's supposed defeat... never happened.Payne: Nnn... nunngk!Judge: We must now ask ourselves whether we can trust the witness's testimony at--???:Judge: E-Excuse me? What is it, Ms. Orly?Olga: I... I did not want to be saying this, but... Actually, you see, erm...Payne: See what, Ms. Orly!? What do we see!?Olga: In the last hand, there was cheat!Payne: A ch-cheat? You... You don't mean... ...a trick!?Judge: Wait, or do you mean... ..a scam!?Apollo: (They're all the same thing!)Olga: Yes, there was cheat in last hand... That is why game ends with chips as they are!Apollo: (Great... Just great... First we have lying... now cheating...)Kristoph: Well, this case certainly has taken a turn... ...for the interesting!Judge: Witness! You will please testify to the court! Tell us about this cheating in the final hand!Witness Testimony-- The Final Hand --Olga: The last hand... both men had \"full house\". There is four of each card in deck, from ace to king. If you look at both men's hands, cheat is more obvious! The next moment, game becomes argument, dah! The defendant's trick was exposed! He took bottle in his hand... Poor Mr. Smith!Apollo: Ms. Orly! Why did you not tell the court about this from the very beginning!?Olga: ...Apollo: (I thought I smelled a cover-up here... Well folks, it's time to throw back the covers!)Judge: Hmm... A full house is a very high-scoring hand. Not easy to make, in my experience.Payne: That alone is enough to suspect less-than-scrupulous tactics.Apollo: Um... Mr. Gavin? What's a full house?Payne: Lawyers these days... You don't know your poker?Judge: I can't say this bodes well for your case... or career.Apollo: (What is this, some kind of secret court poker ring!?)Kristoph: ...Justice. You know the terms \"one pair\", \"two pair\", and \"three of a kind\", yes?Apollo: Uh, yeah! No problem! Two cards with the same number makes a pair, and three makes a three of a kind!Kristoph: Good. Now picture a hand with one pair, and one three of a kind. That's a full house.Apollo: (Hmm... That doesn't sound very easy to make, does it.)Payne: You can see each player's hand in this photo.Apollo: (Wow... They both have full houses!)Payne: We forget, there's an easy way to make a full house... and go undefeated for seven years. You cheat.Judge: Ahem. The defense may cross-examine the witness.Apollo: (If he did cheat in the last hand, that still leaves one important question... Mr. Wright lost that hand. Who's ever heard of a professional con man losing when they cheat!?)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Final Hand --Olga: The last hand... both men had \"full house\".Press Apollo: Apollo: Just how hard is it to make a full house, anyway?

    "cot": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking which evidence and testimony contradict each other in the given story. I need to find a pair where the evidence directly contradicts a statement in the testimony.\n\nFirst, let's recap the key points. The main contradiction earlier was about the chip values. Olga initially said the big chips were 1000 and small 100, but the total points didn't add up. Apollo proved that the small ones were actually 1000 and big ones 100, showing the defendant was winning. Now, the new testimony is about cheating in the final hand.\n\nLooking at the testimonies, Olga now says that Mr. Smith had three aces, and Mr. Wright had two, making five aces total (Testimony 3). But in a standard deck, there are only four aces (Testimony 1 says four of each card). The evidence here would be the hands shown in the Chip Photo (Evidence 6). Evidence 6's description shows both hands: defendant's cards (Wright) are 7s and two Aces, victim's (Smith) are Kings and two Aces. Wait, no\u2014the victim's hand according to Evidence 6 is three Kings and two Aces? Wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nEvidence 6's caption says: On the near side (defendant, Wright), the cards are 7 heart, 7 diamond, 7 club, Ace spade, Ace diamond. So that's three 7s and two Aces\u2014a full house. On the far side (victim, Smith), the cards are King heart, King diamond, King spade, Ace club, Ace heart. That's three Kings and two Aces. So both have three of a kind and a pair, making full houses. But according to Olga's testimony (Testimony 3), Smith has three aces and Wright two, totaling five aces. But in the actual evidence, Smith's hand has two Aces, not three. Wait, wait. The victim's hand in Evidence 6 is three Kings and two Aces. So three Kings, two Aces. So Smith's hand has two Aces, not three. But Olga's testimony says Smith's hand has three Aces and Wright's two. That would mean Smith has three Aces and two Kings, but the evidence shows three Kings and two Aces. So Olga's testimony about the fifth Ace is conflicting with the actual cards in the photo. Therefore, the evidence (Chip Photo, 6) shows that the victim has three Kings and two Aces, while the testimony claims three Aces and two, leading to five aces. But there's a fifth ace from the victim's three, which isn't possible in a standard deck. Wait, the testimony says Smith has three, Wright has two, totaling five. But the deck only has four. So the fifth ace is impossible. The evidence (Chip Photo) shows that the victim's hand has two Aces, not three, so the testimony's claim of three aces in Smith's hand is contradicted by the actual cards shown in the photo. Therefore, Evidence 6 contradicts Testimony 3. Because Olga says Smith has three aces, but the photo shows two. Also, the fifth ace would be impossible. So the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (five aces) and the Evidence 6 (each hand has two aces, so total four in play, but Olga's testimony implies five)."

Now... which of these hands is more suspicious?)View victim's hand Apollo: (It was the victim's hand that \"changed\" over the course of the witness's testimony...) The defense requests time to examine Mr. Smith's cards. Judge: Very well. Mr. Payne, if you would... Payne: ...Very well. Received evidence: Victim's Hand. Kristoph: Well, time's a wasting. Get to it, Justice. Apollo: Y-Yes, sir! Kristoph: When examining evidence, be sure to view it from all sides and angles. Try using [right analog stick / arrow keys] to turn it every which way, and [X / B] and [Y / M] to zoom in and out. (Changed from [Try using the dials on the evidence viewer.] in the original release) That should give you a better perspective on the case. Apollo: (OK... Let's do this!) Examine cards with red back Apollo: The card backs are red... For some reason I thought that they were using blue cards in that final hand... Didn't you, Mr. Gavin? Kristoph: Huh? Oh, hmm. Which was it now... Examine card with blue back Leads to: \"Wh-What...!?\" Go back Judge: Well, has the defense found anything of relevance? Apollo: (Uh... I think I found out that I found nothing out.) Kristoph: Perhaps you'd best examine the defendant's cards... before leaping to any conclusions. Or maybe you'd rather examine these cards one more time? Apollo: (Well? Do I examine the other hand of cards?) Examine the other hand Apollo: (Guess I'll examine Mr. Wright's cards.) Your Honor! The defense requests time to examine Mr. Wright's hand! Judge: Granted, but make it quick, Mr. Justice. Received evidence: Wright's Hand. Apollo: (Don't worry, Justice is always swift!) Leads to Wright's Hand examination Examine this hand again Apollo: (No... According to the testimony, it was the victim's hand that changed. Better take a closer look!) Leads back to Victim's Hand examinationView defendant's hand Apollo: (Let's start with Mr. Wright's hand.) The defense would like to view the defendant's hand. Judge: Very well. Mr. Payne! Your evidence. Payne: Y-Yes, Your Honor! Received evidence: Wright's Hand. Kristoph: Well now... Let's see what we have here. Apollo: Right... Right, sir! Kristoph: When examining evidence, be sure to view it from all sides and angles. Try using [right analog stick / arrow keys] to turn it every which way, and [X / B] and [Y / M] to zoom in and out. (Changed from [Try using the dials on the evidence viewer.] in the original release) That should give you a better perspective on the case. Apollo: (OK... Let's do this!) Examine cards with red back Apollo: The card backs are red... For some reason I thought that they were using blue cards in that final hand... Didn't you, Mr. Gavin? Kristoph: Huh? Oh, hmm. Which was it now... Go back Judge: Well, has the defense found anything they would like to share with the court? Apollo: (Uh... Not unless you count utter confusion.) Kristoph: Perhaps you'd best examine the victim's cards next? Of course, you can always give these cards another look. Apollo: (Well? Do I examine the other hand of cards?) Examine the other hand Apollo: (Guess I'll examine the victim's cards...) Your Honor! The defense requests time to examine Mr. Smith's hand! Judge: Granted, but make it quick, Mr. Justice. Received evidence: Victim's Hand. Apollo: (Don't worry, Justice is always swift!) Leads to Victim's Hand examination Examine this hand again Apollo: (Maybe I missed something the first time... Better check them again.) Leads back to Wright's Hand examinationApollo: (Wh-What...!?) Your Honor! Look at this! One of the victim's cards... The back is a different color!Examine evidence Victim's Hand Cards with red back Apollo: The card backs are red... For some reason I thought they were using blue-backed cards in the final hand... Card with blue back Apollo: Only one of cards has a blue back... I'm much more of a red guy myself. Blue is so... not red, you know?Payne: Eh...? Ehhhhhh!?Olga: Th-That's impossible! But I put that card in Wright's hand... Ack!Kristoph: ...What was that, Ms. Orly?Olga: No... Ny-Nyet! Er, I merely said, eh... Dah, I have, eek!Kristoph: Your Honor?Judge: M-Mr. Gavin, yes?Kristoph: Tell me, what is the easiest way to cheat at poker?Judge: To... cheat?Kristoph: I'll tell you. One merely needs a friend, a \"comrade\", shall we say... The dealer!Judge: Ah... Ah!Apollo: Wait, so you mean... This witness... Ms. Orly...Kristoph: She's the cheater. A professional, I'd wager.Olga: Nyeeeeeeaaaaargh!Judge: Order! Order!!!Apollo: (Focus, Justice! Time to take advantage of her! ...I mean, of her mistake!) Your Honor! Please recall the testimony we just heard!Olga: Th-That's impossible! But I put that card in Wright's hand...Apollo: ...Ergo! Ms. Olga Orly conspired to cheat, not with my client... ...but with the victim, Mr. Shadi Smith!Olga: Ooooooogh!Apollo: Not only did she cheat, she cheated poorly! Therefore! It's not hard to imagine an altercation between her and the victim...Payne: Whaaaaaaaaaaaat!?Judge: Wait, you don't mean... The defense isn't accusing the witness, Ms. Olga Orly... are you?Apollo: (Time for Justice! There were three people in the room at the time of the incident. And if Mr. Wright isn't guilty, that means...) ...I am! The defense accuses the witness, Ms. Olga Orly, of murder!Olga: Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!Judge: ...Mr. Payne. Where is your witness, Ms. Olga Orly?Payne: Erm, it appears she has lost, eh, consciousness, Your Honor.Judge: Hmm... Mr. Justice?Apollo: Your Honor!Judge: It seems you've presented a new possibility to the court. One suggesting a connection between the witness and the victim, Mr. Smith.Apollo: And that means...!?Judge: The court cannot pronounce a verdict for the defendant at this time!Payne: Nnk...! What!?Apollo: (I did it! I held out!)Judge: I see no point in prolonging the trial this day. The prosecution will need to make further inquiries...Phoenix:Apollo: M-Mr. Wright...?Phoenix: ...You can't end the trial here, Your Honor. Not yet.Payne: What nonsense is the defendant spewing now!?Phoenix: Think. One of the cards had a different colored back. Don't you wonder what it means?Payne:Payne: Wh-What are you doing, Mr. Wright!? Raising objections right when you're about to get off the hook!? Ridiculous!Judge: Mr. Payne, you of all people should know... Mr. Wright has a talent... ...for the ridiculous! Perhaps we should get to the bottom of things. Let's clear up the facts about the game that fateful night.Phoenix: As was said before... We alternated between two decks of cards that night.Payne: That was said before!Phoenix: The two decks at the club have different colored backs: Blue... and red. One color per deck.Apollo: Why use different-colored backs?Phoenix: If we used the same color, the two decks might get mixed.Apollo: (Um, you used different colors and they STILL got mixed up.)Phoenix: We used the red deck for the last game.Judge: Hmm... I see. But... that's odd. For some reason... I have this impression that you were using the blue cards!Apollo: (Yeah, me too... I'm sure someone said something about blue cards...)Payne: Whatever. In the end one card of the wrong color got into the mix... Which means there was cheating.Phoenix: Yes, a card slipped into the deck would seem to indicate cheating... Yet... this card raises two serious questions. ...Apollo?Apollo: Y-Yes?Phoenix: Let's consider the first question, shall we? Think. In the last game... when was the card swapped?Apollo: (\"When\"...?)Phoenix: There are three broad possibilities here. It could have been swapped before the murder, during the murder... or after the murder.Payne: Well, yeah! Thanks for the news bulletin, Mr. Wright! Of course it was swapp--Phoenix: Oh? It might be as simple as you think, Mr. Payne. Or it might not be.Payne: Nnnk!Phoenix: I'd like to hear what Apollo thinks first... When do you think the cards were swapped?Apollo: (When was the card swapped into the deck?)Before the murder Apollo: Well, it must have happened before the murder. Judge: You mean, during the game? Phoenix: I wonder... Apollo: Huh? Why? Phoenix: Think. When you're playing poker... ...which side of the cards face your opponent? Apollo: Ack! The back... Judge: Not something the \"Poker Head of Courtroom No. 3\" would be likely to miss! Apollo: Sorry, let me think about this some more... Leads back to: \"When was the card swapped into the deck?\"During the murder Apollo: Well... weren't they swapped during the murder? Judge: \"During\" the murder? Tell me, exactly when is that? Apollo: Huh? Well, the very moment of the act, I guess... Phoenix: Would that be the moment the cards were shown? Kristoph: Or perhaps the moment when the cheater was revealed? Judge: Or maybe the very moment the bottle came down on Mr. Smith's head? Apollo: ... Uh... could I have a moment? Judge: That \"moment\" could cost you this case! Apollo: Sorry... Let me rethink this. Leads back to: \"When was the card swapped into the deck?\"After the murder Leads to: \"Perhaps it happened... after the murder?\"Apollo: Perhaps it happened... after the murder?Payne:Payne: Wh-What's that? Ridiculous! What's the point of cheating after the hands have been shown? That's silly!Apollo:Apollo: Yes! But tell me... How do you swap cards during the game!? I'll take \"silly\" over \"impossible\".Payne:Payne: Take it from me, son. There's a lot of silly in this world, but very little impossible.Apollo: Oh? Even when the backs of the cards are a different color!? If you pulled that during the game, you'd be caught in no time!Judge: Ah...Phoenix: Quite true. That would mean that the blue card in question... ...was swapped after the hands were shown, after the murder!Payne:Payne: OK, this is going past silly and straight on to crazy. I ask again: what's the point of cheating after the game's over!? Who would do that!?Phoenix: Who indeed. That's one of the mysteries before us.Judge: Th-There's another?Phoenix: Yes. A simple, yet decisive question must be asked: Who swapped the red card for a blue card?Apollo: Wh-Who?Kristoph: The game, and murder, is done. The victim is dead. Only two remain in the room. Alive, that is. The defendant, Phoenix Wright, and our witness, Olga Orly.Apollo: (OK, so who was it that swapped the red card for a blue?)Phoenix Wright Apollo: The one who swapped the cards was... Mr. Wright! It was you, wasn't it? Phoenix: And why would I do such a thing? Apollo: Ack! Uh, well, because, uh... ...maybe you were trying to hide the fact that you'd cheated? Judge: That would make sense... but the swapped card was in the victim's hand! Apollo: Oh. Phoenix: Sorry... I'm a nice guy, but I'm not that nice. Apollo: (Come to think of it, he would lack a motive for helping his opponent to win...) Leads back to: \"OK, so who was it that swapped the red card for a blue?\"Olga Orly Apollo: Why, it must have been Olga Orly who swapped the cards! She was trying to cover up evidence of the cheating. Judge: That.. does make some sense. Phoenix: Phoenix: Sorry... But there's a problem with that explanation. Apollo: Huh? Phoenix: The swapped card was from the wrong deck. Judge: Yes, a blue card was stuck into a red hand. Phoenix: Mixing a card from the wrong deck... when the backs are different colors? Remember that you're talking about Olga Orly... She was the dealer. Do you really think she would make such a novice mistake? Apollo: (Actually, I have trouble imagining even the judge making that mistake.) Phoenix: Give it a little more thought, Apollo. Apollo: R-Right! Leads back to: \"OK, so who was it that swapped the red card for a blue?\"Someone else Leads to: \"The one who swapped the cards wasn't Mr. Wright, of course.\"Apollo: The one who swapped the cards wasn't Mr. Wright, of course. And, well, it doesn't seem like it could have been Olga Orly, either...Judge: Wh-What are you suggesting!?Kristoph: That's hardly a logical conclusion, I'll admit. As the defense, I think it only makes sense for you to name Ms. Orly at this point.Apollo: Yes, yes, I know! But... But she was the one who dealt the cards, right? I... I just can't believe she would make the mistake of swapping the wrong-color card!Judge: And if the card was swapped during the game, it'd be obvious...Phoenix: Heh. Heh heh heh heh.Judge: Something you'd like to share with the court, Mr. Wright?Phoenix: Oh, my apologies, Your Honor. I was just thinking how much fun all this is.Payne:Payne: Fun!? How about confusing!? I've no idea what the defense is claiming, Your Honor. If the one who swapped the card wasn't the defendant, and it wasn't Ms. Orly... Then who was it!?Apollo: Er, yeah, well, that is the question, isn't it?Phoenix: Precisely.Apollo: Huh?Phoenix: I believe we're about to see this case take... a new direction.Judge: A new direction?Phoenix: We'll find that, indeed, after the murder... ...someone swapped one of the cards in the victim's hand. And that someone made two critical mistakes.Kristoph: I'm sure you're going to tell us that the first was swapping the wrong-color card.Phoenix: Because the one who did the swap didn't know two colors of cards were being used. The other mistake... was the number on the card.Apollo: Right... The person replaced the fifth ace with a king.Phoenix: I'm sure whoever swapped it wasn't expecting there to be a fifth ace, after all. All they knew was that the game had been won with a full house. So they picked up a king from the table, and swapped it in.Payne:Payne: B-But! There's one problem... According to our case record this person doesn't exist!!!Phoenix: True, not until now. But you have to admit the possibility of a fourth person. Though it's more than a possibility. There was someone else there that night at the scene of the crime.Payne: Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaat!?Kristoph: I believe the judge spoke truthfully earlier. You do make trials... ridiculous, Mr. Wright.Judge: This trial has proceeded on one central assumption: Namely, that, at the time of the incident, there were only three people in that room.Phoenix: I believe this new evidence, shall we say... overturns that assumption?Judge: The problem is that you chose to conceal this information from the court!Phoenix: ...I suppose that is a problem, yes.Judge: Court is adjourned for a brief recess! Mr. Gavin, I'll see you in my chambers during this recess.Kristoph: ...Certainly, Your Honor.Judge: Very well! The trial will resume in twenty minutes!April 20, 11:52 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 3Kristoph: That was quite... unexpected, Mr. Wright. To suddenly claim there was another person at the scene of the crime like that... I must ask... is it the truth?Phoenix: Well now... I'd think you would know the answer to that?Kristoph: Ah, being mysterious, are we? Sadly, I've no time for mysteries. I'd only ask that you leave the defending to your defense, in the future. Otherwise... I cannot guarantee the outcome.Phoenix: I see you haven't mellowed out one bit, Kristoph.Kristoph: Justice.Apollo: Y-Yes, sir!Kristoph: The judge has summoned me to his chambers, so carry on without me.Phoenix: You did well, Apollo.Apollo: Um.. Can I ask you something?Phoenix: Sure.Apollo: That locket you wear... Is that really yours, Mr. Wright?Phoenix: Ah, you're wondering about the victim's disappearing locket? Here, you can take a look at it. That's a picture of my daughter in there.Apollo: I'm... just surprised to hear you had a daughter.Phoenix: Most people are. Perhaps you'll meet her one of these days.Apollo: One more question. The one who cheated that night... Was it you?Phoenix: ... What do you think?Apollo: Huh?Phoenix: You know what happened seven years ago... What I did. It's not unreasonable for you to think I might cheat.Apollo: I-I never! Honest! But... (It IS odd that he managed to go undefeated for seven whole years...)Phoenix: Want to know something? There's only one game where you can be dealt bad cards all night and still win. Poker.Apollo: Eh...?Phoenix: You see, poker is all about reading your opponent. In that way, it's a lot like a court case.Apollo: Poker... is like trial law!?Phoenix: Figure out what your opponent is thinking, and you win.Apollo: Well, yeah, but that's harder than it sounds.Phoenix: I think not.Apollo: ...!Phoenix: Try as they might to conceal it, everyone reveals their true thoughts in the end. Their body language can become a valuable source of information.Apollo: You're kidding!Phoenix: That witness, for instance, Ms. Orly. She would touch the back of her neck during certain parts of her testimony. Did you notice?Apollo: Uh... No. (C'mon, who'd notice that!?)Phoenix: Words, habits, twitches... It's all information for the reading. That's the secret to winning, Apollo. Someone taught me, and now, I pass the secret on to you.Apollo: B-But, I'm not worthy! I mean, there's no way I'll pick up on these \"signals\".Phoenix: No. You can do it.Apollo: Huh?Phoenix: You just don't know it yet.Apollo: (What's he talking about...?)Phoenix: But you will. Soon. Ah, almost forgot. One more thing. About this case... You should know, I haven't told the truth to anyone yet.Apollo: Whaaaaaaaa--!? (I knew it!)Phoenix: I have my reasons, of course. All shall be revealed. And Apollo... I need you to be there, defending me. I need your power.Apollo: My, um, power? (I had no idea my Chords of Steel were that special...)Phoenix: ...It's time. The real trial begins now. Do your best.To be continued.April 20, 12:14 PMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 2Judge: Court will now reconvene. Has our witness, Ms. Olga Orly, recovered?Payne: Y-Yes, Your Honor! Er, well, she's regained consciousness.Kristoph: Perhaps we can hear her version of the events again?Payne: That's the thing... You see, she's quite fatigued.Judge: You're looking a bit fatigued yourself, Mr. Payne.Kristoph: Sadly, fatigue is insufficient grounds for refusing to testify... or prosecute. The defense would like to request that Ms. Orly take the stand.Judge: Very well. The witness will take the stand!Kristoph: Perhaps you could repeat your name and profession?Olga: ...Kristoph: Or perhaps you'd rather admit that you're a poor liar, and a poorer loser.Olga: Ny-Ny-Nye-! ... Not. Name's Olga Orly. That's the truth. I'm a pro dealer. People call me... Olga \"Quick-Fingers\" Orly!Judge: Oh... Oh really?Olga: Want to know something else? I'm not really Russian! And my last name sounds like \"Oh really\"! There, that's the truth! I hope you're satisfied.Apollo: Witness! You will tell the court what you were really up to that night!Olga: Fine, I'll talk. We had a plan, see.Judge: Let me remind you that you are currently under oath. Any further fabrications will have serious consequences.Olga: ... Fine.Olga: Like I said, I'm a pro. That guy, Smith, hired me to do what I do best. I was planted at the Borscht Bowl Club several days prior to the night of the game. As a waitress.Apollo: So you were in cahoots with the victim!Olga: Not that he needed my help. Smith is a well-known poker player in some circles. But winning wasn't the main purpose of this game. It was about destroying a legend: the unbeatable Phoenix Wright! The plan was simple. Elegant, really. You see, we set up a trap of sorts... I was to plant a card in Wright's pocket beforehand... ...and then deal five aces during one of their games. When their hands were revealed, Smith would call him out and search Wright. He would then pull out the planted card and the trap would snap shut!You swapped the cards!Olga: Exposed as a cheater and losing on top of it! It would have made a great double play. Just like that, the legend would be dashed to pieces.Judge: Indeed... Getting caught red-handed at cheating would cast doubt on all his prior wins...Olga: A seven-year legend, destroyed by one little card... That was the plan!Kristoph: \"Oh really, Orly\"? How droll. But... it appears you made quite the mistake.Judge: A mistake?Kristoph: I agree, the trap was elegant. Yet, what happened to that planted card?Apollo: Hey, that's right!Olga: He's lucky, I'll give him that. You'd have to be to slip free from a trap laid by Olga \"Quick-Fingers\" Orly!Judge: Oh really? The witness would be much cuter if she dispensed with the evil mastermind shtick.Olga: Cute...? Who wants to be cute? I'm not cute! I'm bad! You hear me? Bad!!!Judge: When you're through being bad, perhaps you could testify to the court? Tell us about this \"trap\"... and how it was sprung.Witness Testimony-- The Best Laid Traps --Olga: That night, I planted the card like I was supposed to. And Wright lost the last hand, just like he was supposed to. Then Smith searched him! But the planted card was gone! The trap failed. The next moment, Wright picked up a bottle and swung it! It wasn't me who hit Smith! It was that no-good, cheating defendant!Judge: Hmm... A surprisingly frank testimony that still leaves us mostly in the dark.Olga: The trap was perfect I tell you, perfect! If that rotten cheater hadn't messed it up.Apollo: Look who's talking!Judge: Well, the testimony, for what it's worth, is all yours, Mr. Justice.Apollo: (With witnesses like her, who needs criminals? ...And with defendants like Mr. Wright, who needs prosecutors?)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Best Laid Traps --Olga: That night, I planted the card like I was supposed to.Press Apollo: Apollo: This planted card... which card was it, exactly? Olga: The trump card... the Five of Hearts. Judge: Let me guess. Mr. Wright was to have switched the Five with the Ace to make a full house. At least, that's what you were going to accuse him of doing, thereby ruining his legend. Olga: I slid it into Wright's pocket. Apollo: When was this...? Olga: Why, before the match, of course. While he was eating. At the Borscht Bowl Club, we serve borscht... and suckers. Judge: Remind me never to go there. Olga: Of course, the card was to make its grand debut during the game... Like a good borscht, a good plot must be cooked up early and allowed to thicken.Olga: And Wright lost the last hand, just like he was supposed to. Then Smith searched him!Press Apollo: Apollo: So, everything went according to plan... Olga: Exactly. The fifth ace came up, so it's obvious the switch went off without a hitch. Once the extra card was found in his pocket... ...Wright would be forever known as a cheat and a fraud. Judge: There are worse things to be known as I suppose. Apollo: Tell us what happened with the search.Olga: But the planted card was gone! The trap failed.Press Apollo: Apollo: The card... disappeared? Olga: Yeah! My trump card, the Five of Hearts! Gone! Without a trace! Poof! Zippo! We searched every nook and cranny... Even inside his cute little hat! Apollo: But the card was nowhere to be found, is this correct? Olga: Never in my long, storied career... Never has \"Quick-Fingers\" Orly been so readily duped! Judge: Oh really. So, what did happen to that Five of Hearts? Olga: Don't look at me. Why don't you ask that cheating, lying, two-faced defendant? Apollo: (So the Five of Hearts is still missing in action...)Olga: The next moment, Wright picked up a bottle and swung it!Press Apollo: Apollo: Wait... Isn't that a little odd? Olga: Wh-What's odd!? Apollo: You searched Mr. Wright, er, thoroughly, and found nothing? Which means he didn't cheat... Which means he had no reason to strike the victim! Olga: W-Well... BRACELET THUMPS Apollo: (Wh-What was that just now!? I... sensed something...) Judge: Something wrong, Mr. Justice? Apollo: No... nothing, Your Honor. (What to do? Should I press her a little harder?) Press harder Apollo: Ms. Orly...! You're hiding something! Olga: Wh-What are you talking about!? Y-Y-You! M-M-M-Me? \"Quick-Fingers\" Orly, hi-hi-hide something? Payne: Payne: The defense will refrain from baseless accusations! Apollo: I have one question for the witness then. You say you saw the moment the defendant hit the victim. ...Is this true? Olga: O-Of course it's true! I d-did see it, honest! I saw it when Wright hit him.  BRACELET THUMPS Olga: With my own eyes, I saw it! Apollo: (What's this weird vibe I'm getting!?) Phoenix: That witness, for instance, Ms. Orly. She would touch the back of her neck during certain parts of her testimony. Did you notice? Apollo: (Touching her neck, was it? Whoa! What's going on? This sensation... It's coming into focus! There! That twitch! It's so clear! It's like I could perceive her habit like I couldn't before!) Perceive Apollo: Leads to: \"Ms. Orly... Perhaps you are unaware of this yourself...\" Apollo: Ms. Orly... Perhaps you are unaware of this yourself... Olga: Un-Unaware of what? Apollo: Whenever you get to a certain part of your testimony... ...you touch the back of your neck with your left hand! Olga: ...! My... My neck? So... So what!? Kristoph: What indeed, Justice? I hadn't noticed anything of the sort... Apollo: When she says that part of the testimony... She's subconsciously recalling something... Her body reacts to the memory, and she touches her neck! I'm sure of it! Payne: A memory? Would someone care to explain what he's babbling about? Judge: This is highly unusual... but let's ask the defense. You claim the witness is remembering something. Maybe you have evidence of this \"memory\" to show us? Apollo: (Her habit is scratching her neck whenever she talks about the moment of the crime... So, what would remind her most of the moment of the crime!?) Ms. Orly. Whenever you recall the crime that night, you scratch your neck. I've noticed it happens when you think about the moment of the crime. There must be some reason behind this \"habit\" of yours. I believe the weapon that left an inerasable \"impression\" on your neck is this! Present Deadly Bottle Apollo: Leads to: \"Whenever she talks about the moment of the crime, she touches her neck...\" Present anything else Apollo: Olga: ... Sorry to disappoint, but I don't have any particular memories of that! Apollo: (Uh oh... That must not have been it!) Payne: Hmph! Of course not! You want a habit, Mr. Justice? I'll show you a habit!!! Ah ha ha hah! Apollo: (I'd better get this sorted out before I develop a habit of my own...) Leads back to: \"Her habit is scratching her neck whenever she talks about the moment of the crime...\" Apollo: Whenever she talks about the moment of the crime, she touches her neck... And what reminds us more of that moment than this bottle, the murder weapon! Olga: ...! Apollo: But... something doesn't fit. If you were only the witness to the crime... ...why would that make you touch your neck like you're in pain? Payne: What's he talking about now!? Apollo: It was Mr. Smith, the victim who was hit... not you! Olga: Uh... Uhmmm... Payne: Payne: This is a cross-examination, not a cross-wild-conjecture! Th-The witness's... \"habits\"!? They're completely irrelevant! Kristoph: Justice... I'll admit, I'm a bit confused myself. This is certainly a... unique cross-examination. Apollo: I'll explain later! Just, trust me. Now's our only chance to break her! Ms. Orly! Please testify, in detail, about the moment of the crime. The very moment! Olga: Ny-Nyet. I am knowing nothing. Payne: ... Judge: ... Apollo: ... Um, we know you're not Russian. Judge: The witness will testify, please. Now. Olga: Bah. Fine! Changes statement from \"It wasn't me who hit Smith! It was that no-good, cheating defendant!\" to \"He's the one who did it! I didn't let him out of my sight until the cops got there!\" No need Apollo: (Nah... I'm just seeing things.) Sorry, it's nothing. Please continue the testimony. (What was that? A dizzy spell? I gotta relax...) Leads back to cross-examinationPress (after changing fifth statement) Apollo: Apollo: You're hiding something, and that habit of yours proves it! Olga: Hah! Ludicrous! I'm not h-hiding anything! Apollo: You touched your neck again. Olga: Ack! Apollo: It's no use trying to hide it. I can see right through you. Olga: ...Olga: It wasn't me who hit Smith! It was that no-good, cheating defendant!Press Apollo: Apollo: Let me ask, how's your eyesight? Olga: Just who do you think you're talking to? They don't call me \"Quick-Fingers\" for nothing. I'm a pro. Which means my dealing's pro, and my eyesight... is pro! Payne: Honestly, she'd have to be blind as a bat to miss something in that small room. Apollo: (Yeah, but Mr. Wright didn't have a motive to hit the victim! Hmm...)Olga: He's the one who did it! I didn't let him out of my sight until the cops got there!Press Apollo: Apollo: You seem... uneasy. Olga: You try standing up here! (Changed from [You try sitting up here!] in the original release) Apollo: (Her eyes are darting all over the place... I must be getting warm!) Tell me... After the crime, what was the defendant like? Olga: Uh. Well... He must have been stunned by the weight of his crime! He sat in a daze at that table ...until the cops came. Kristoph: Intriguing... I believe you've gotten all the testimony you're going to get out of this witness. So, what do you think about her testimony? Apollo: I'll tell you what I think! Her testimony is.. Flawed Apollo: ...is basically bogus. It contradicts the evidence! Payne: Wh-What's that!? Judge: Well... Show us this evidence, Mr. Justice! This evidence that you claim contradicts the testimony! Apollo: (She didn't let him out of her sight until the cops got there... I know there's some evidence that contradicts that!) Present Wright's Cell Phone Apollo: Leads to: \"Ms. Orly! We have a record here that clearly contradicts what you said!\" Present anything else Apollo: Apollo: This, Your Honor, is the evidence that contradicts her testimony! Judge: ... Well, Mr. Payne? Payne: Tsk. Who would have thought that Justice could be so wrong! He's the guilty one! Apollo: (Gah! Me!?) Judge: ...Mr. Justice. You might want to think about your future before doing that again. Apollo: (Ouch. That one hurt...) Leads back to cross-examination Fine Apollo: ...pretty good, really. I'd be upset too at the scene of a crime like that. Yeah, I can picture my mind going blank, staring listlessly... Kristoph: Yes, I am picturing you doing that right now. As for our defendant, he is an experienced trial lawyer... He's seen a lot in his day. Leads back to cross-examinationPresent Wright's Cell Phone Apollo: Leads to: \"Ms. Orly!

    "cot": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other based on the provided story, characters, evidences, and testimonies.\n\nFirst, let me recap the key points from the story. The main contradiction revolves around the fifth ace and the cheating during the poker game. Olga Orly, the witness, initially testifies that there were five aces in total between the two players' hands (three in Smith's and two in Wright's). However, when Apollo presents the Chip Photo (Evidence 6), it's shown that each player had two aces, totaling four. This led to the discovery that one of the cards in the victim's hand had a blue back instead of red, indicating a swapped card from a different deck.\n\nBut now, looking at the current testimonies in \"The Best Laid Traps\" testimony, Olga claims that after the murder, she didn't let Phoenix Wright out of her sight until the police arrived. However, there's evidence that Wright used his cell phone (Evidence 4) to call the police from the restaurant's first floor. If Olga didn't let him out of her sight, how could he have gone to the first floor to make the call? That would mean he left the crime scene, contradicting her testimony that she was watching him the entire time.\n\nSo the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (He's the one who did it! I didn't let him out of my sight until the cops got there!) and Evidence 4 (Wright's Cell Phone), which shows he left to call the police, hence being out of her sight."

    "prompt": "You are provided with a list of characters, evidences and testimonies.\nStory:\n\n-- The Best Laid Traps --Olga: That night, I planted the card like I was supposed to.Press Apollo: Apollo: This planted card... which card was it, exactly? Olga: The trump card... the Five of Hearts. Judge: Let me guess. Mr. Wright was to have switched the Five with the Ace to make a full house. At least, that's what you were going to accuse him of doing, thereby ruining his legend. Olga: I slid it into Wright's pocket. Apollo: When was this...? Olga: Why, before the match, of course. While he was eating. At the Borscht Bowl Club, we serve borscht... and suckers. Judge: Remind me never to go there. Olga: Of course, the card was to make its grand debut during the game... Like a good borscht, a good plot must be cooked up early and allowed to thicken.Olga: And Wright lost the last hand, just like he was supposed to. Then Smith searched him!Press Apollo: Apollo: So, everything went according to plan... Olga: Exactly. The fifth ace came up, so it's obvious the switch went off without a hitch. Once the extra card was found in his pocket... ...Wright would be forever known as a cheat and a fraud. Judge: There are worse things to be known as I suppose. Apollo: Tell us what happened with the search.Olga: But the planted card was gone! The trap failed.Press Apollo: Apollo: The card... disappeared? Olga: Yeah! My trump card, the Five of Hearts! Gone! Without a trace! Poof! Zippo! We searched every nook and cranny... Even inside his cute little hat! Apollo: But the card was nowhere to be found, is this correct? Olga: Never in my long, storied career... Never has \"Quick-Fingers\" Orly been so readily duped! Judge: Oh really. So, what did happen to that Five of Hearts? Olga: Don't look at me. Why don't you ask that cheating, lying, two-faced defendant? Apollo: (So the Five of Hearts is still missing in action...)Olga: The next moment, Wright picked up a bottle and swung it!Press Apollo: Apollo: Wait... Isn't that a little odd? Olga: Wh-What's odd!? Apollo: You searched Mr. Wright, er, thoroughly, and found nothing? Which means he didn't cheat... Which means he had no reason to strike the victim! Olga: W-Well... BRACELET THUMPS Apollo: (Wh-What was that just now!? I... sensed something...) Judge: Something wrong, Mr. Justice? Apollo: No... nothing, Your Honor. (What to do? Should I press her a little harder?) Press harder Apollo: Ms. Orly...! You're hiding something! Olga: Wh-What are you talking about!? Y-Y-You! M-M-M-Me? \"Quick-Fingers\" Orly, hi-hi-hide something? Payne: Payne: The defense will refrain from baseless accusations! Apollo: I have one question for the witness then. You say you saw the moment the defendant hit the victim. ...Is this true? Olga: O-Of course it's true! I d-did see it, honest! I saw it when Wright hit him.  BRACELET THUMPS Olga: With my own eyes, I saw it! Apollo: (What's this weird vibe I'm getting!?) Phoenix: That witness, for instance, Ms. Orly. She would touch the back of her neck during certain parts of her testimony. Did you notice? Apollo: (Touching her neck, was it? Whoa! What's going on? This sensation... It's coming into focus! There! That twitch! It's so clear! It's like I could perceive her habit like I couldn't before!) Perceive Apollo: Leads to: \"Ms. Orly... Perhaps you are unaware of this yourself...\" Apollo: Ms. Orly... Perhaps you are unaware of this yourself... Olga: Un-Unaware of what? Apollo: Whenever you get to a certain part of your testimony... ...you touch the back of your neck with your left hand! Olga: ...! My... My neck? So... So what!? Kristoph: What indeed, Justice? I hadn't noticed anything of the sort... Apollo: When she says that part of the testimony... She's subconsciously recalling something... Her body reacts to the memory, and she touches her neck! I'm sure of it! Payne: A memory? Would someone care to explain what he's babbling about? Judge: This is highly unusual... but let's ask the defense. You claim the witness is remembering something. Maybe you have evidence of this \"memory\" to show us? Apollo: (Her habit is scratching her neck whenever she talks about the moment of the crime... So, what would remind her most of the moment of the crime!?) Ms. Orly. Whenever you recall the crime that night, you scratch your neck. I've noticed it happens when you think about the moment of the crime. There must be some reason behind this \"habit\" of yours. I believe the weapon that left an inerasable \"impression\" on your neck is this! Present Deadly Bottle Apollo: Leads to: \"Whenever she talks about the moment of the crime, she touches her neck...\" Present anything else Apollo: Olga: ... Sorry to disappoint, but I don't have any particular memories of that! Apollo: (Uh oh... That must not have been it!) Payne: Hmph! Of course not! You want a habit, Mr. Justice? I'll show you a habit!!! Ah ha ha hah! Apollo: (I'd better get this sorted out before I develop a habit of my own...) Leads back to: \"Her habit is scratching her neck whenever she talks about the moment of the crime...\" Apollo: Whenever she talks about the moment of the crime, she touches her neck... And what reminds us more of that moment than this bottle, the murder weapon! Olga: ...! Apollo: But... something doesn't fit. If you were only the witness to the crime... ...why would that make you touch your neck like you're in pain? Payne: What's he talking about now!? Apollo: It was Mr. Smith, the victim who was hit... not you! Olga: Uh... Uhmmm... Payne: Payne: This is a cross-examination, not a cross-wild-conjecture! Th-The witness's... \"habits\"!? They're completely irrelevant! Kristoph: Justice... I'll admit, I'm a bit confused myself. This is certainly a... unique cross-examination. Apollo: I'll explain later! Just, trust me. Now's our only chance to break her! Ms. Orly! Please testify, in detail, about the moment of the crime. The very moment! Olga: Ny-Nyet. I am knowing nothing. Payne: ... Judge: ... Apollo: ... Um, we know you're not Russian. Judge: The witness will testify, please. Now. Olga: Bah. Fine! Changes statement from \"It wasn't me who hit Smith! It was that no-good, cheating defendant!\" to \"He's the one who did it! I didn't let him out of my sight until the cops got there!\" No need Apollo: (Nah... I'm just seeing things.) Sorry, it's nothing. Please continue the testimony. (What was that? A dizzy spell? I gotta relax...) Leads back to cross-examinationPress (after changing fifth statement) Apollo: Apollo: You're hiding something, and that habit of yours proves it! Olga: Hah! Ludicrous! I'm not h-hiding anything! Apollo: You touched your neck again. Olga: Ack! Apollo: It's no use trying to hide it. I can see right through you. Olga: ...Olga: It wasn't me who hit Smith! It was that no-good, cheating defendant!Press Apollo: Apollo: Let me ask, how's your eyesight? Olga: Just who do you think you're talking to? They don't call me \"Quick-Fingers\" for nothing. I'm a pro. Which means my dealing's pro, and my eyesight... is pro! Payne: Honestly, she'd have to be blind as a bat to miss something in that small room. Apollo: (Yeah, but Mr. Wright didn't have a motive to hit the victim! Hmm...)Olga: He's the one who did it! I didn't let him out of my sight until the cops got there!Press Apollo: Apollo: You seem... uneasy. Olga: You try standing up here! (Changed from [You try sitting up here!] in the original release) Apollo: (Her eyes are darting all over the place... I must be getting warm!) Tell me... After the crime, what was the defendant like? Olga: Uh. Well... He must have been stunned by the weight of his crime! He sat in a daze at that table ...until the cops came. Kristoph: Intriguing... I believe you've gotten all the testimony you're going to get out of this witness. So, what do you think about her testimony? Apollo: I'll tell you what I think! Her testimony is.. Flawed Apollo: ...is basically bogus. It contradicts the evidence! Payne: Wh-What's that!? Judge: Well... Show us this evidence, Mr. Justice! This evidence that you claim contradicts the testimony! Apollo: (She didn't let him out of her sight until the cops got there... I know there's some evidence that contradicts that!) Present Wright's Cell Phone Apollo: Leads to: \"Ms. Orly! We have a record here that clearly contradicts what you said!\" Present anything else Apollo: Apollo: This, Your Honor, is the evidence that contradicts her testimony! Judge: ... Well, Mr. Payne? Payne: Tsk. Who would have thought that Justice could be so wrong! He's the guilty one! Apollo: (Gah! Me!?) Judge: ...Mr. Justice. You might want to think about your future before doing that again. Apollo: (Ouch. That one hurt...) Leads back to cross-examination Fine Apollo: ...pretty good, really. I'd be upset too at the scene of a crime like that. Yeah, I can picture my mind going blank, staring listlessly... Kristoph: Yes, I am picturing you doing that right now. As for our defendant, he is an experienced trial lawyer... He's seen a lot in his day. Leads back to cross-examinationPresent Wright's Cell Phone Apollo: Leads to: \"Ms. Orly! We have a record here that clearly contradicts what you said!\"Apollo: (Different personality... but the same testimony.)Kristoph: I believe you have her where you want her, Justice. The circumstances have changed yet her testimony has not. That means...Apollo: There's got to be a contradiction in there!Kristoph: Quite.Apollo: Ms. Orly! We have a record here that clearly contradicts what you said! It states that the police were alerted by a report from the defendant!Olga: Eh...Apollo: And we know that the defendant left the room, climbed the stairs... ...and made that phone call from the first floor of the Borscht Bowl Club!Olga: Ack!Apollo: So, explain how you kept your eyes on the defendant... ...when he left the room entirely!Olga: Eeeeeeeeek! ...The man who picked up a bottle and swung it that night... wasn't the defendant.Showdown time....You dirty cheat!Check his pockets, now!I-It's gone! The card's gone!...You lose.Auuuuuuuuuugh!Olga: Just then, Smith grabbed the bottle from next to Wright... ...and he hit me!Y-You--! Some master of cheating you turned out to be!!!Eeeeeeeeeeeek!Olga: When I came to...Judge: The victim was already dead... Is that it?Olga: That's why I couldn't reveal who I really was. If it came out that I was in league with Smith, I'd be a suspect for sure!Judge: ...Apollo: ...Payne: ...Judge: Well. Where does this leave us?Payne: M-Madness. Th-This is madness! I'm dreaming! It must have been me who was hit with a bottle and I'm imagining all of this!Judge: It appears our prosecution is at his wit's end, and frankly, I can't blame him. Mr. Gavin, what do you think about this turn of events?Kristoph: ...Apollo: M-Mr. Gavin? Sir?Kristoph: I believe that, as the defense in this case... ...we are compelled to call Ms. Orly a \"big, fat liar\".Olga: Wh-Whaaaaat!?Kristoph: Three were in that room the night of the murder: the defendant, victim, and her. ...And she has a motive.Apollo: A motive?Kristoph: Her plot foiled, the witness got into an argument with her client, Mr. Smith. And the denouement of that argument... was murder!Olga: What!? I didn't... I'm no killer! It's a trap! Someone's trying to frame me!Phoenix: Heh heh heh... What tangled webs we weave when we practice to deceive. So tangled, we catch ourselves in the process.Judge: M-Mr. Wright?Phoenix: Such a hasty conclusion... It's not like you, Kristoph Gavin.Kristoph: What are you saying?Phoenix: Why not consider the other possibility? ...That there was another person in the room at the time of the murder?Apollo: (Right, like Mr. Wright was saying before recess!)Phoenix: A single card was swapped into the victim's hand after the murder. And the one who swapped the card didn't know two colors of cards were being used. ...A fourth person.Payne:Payne: Hah, this theory again! Your \"fourth person\" doesn't exist!Phoenix: Indeed. That's why I decided to bring this case to court. Here, where there's no escape, and no chance for deception... The perfect place to catch the real criminal.Judge: The r-real criminal?Phoenix: And, we're in luck. A clue to the real criminal's identity was kindly provided for us. And right at the beginning of the trial, no less.Payne: Wh-Whaaaat!?Phoenix: Apollo... perhaps you know what I'm talking about?Apollo: Um... sorry.Phoenix: Remember what I said. The fourth person who swapped the cards made one critical error.Apollo: He or she wasn't considering the color on the backs of the cards...Phoenix: Right. But how could such an obvious mistake occur? The cards used for the last game were red. Yet, there is one person, here, in our court... ...who thought those cards were blue.Apollo: (Yeah, I had that impression, too... But why?)Phoenix: Well, Apollo? Think you can figure out who it was?Payne: I-It's not me, I swear!Judge: Who is this fourth person!?Apollo: (Why do I always get put on the spot like this!?)Phoenix: Let's hear what the defense has to say. Who was it? Who thought the cards used in the final game were blue?Present Kristoph Gavin profile Apollo: Phoenix: ... As I expected. Your eyes and ears are as sharp as your hair. Apollo: I-I was right? Leads to: \"Kristoph Gavin. You were the fourth person that night.\"Present anyone else Apollo: Phoenix: ... Apollo, do you seriously think that? Judge: I think I'm seriously confused. Apollo: I... I'm seriously sorry. (*gulp* That didn't go well.) Phoenix: Well, it can't be helped. I almost missed it myself... But it doesn't do anyone any good to turn their eyes away from the truth. Does it... Kristoph? Kristoph: ... Judge: Eh? Mr. Gavin? Apollo: You... You don't mean... Leads to: \"Kristoph Gavin. You were the fourth person that night.\"Phoenix: Kristoph Gavin. You were the fourth person that night.Apollo: B-But of course Mr. Gavin knows the color of the cards!Phoenix: ...How would he? As you can see, the photo of the crime scene is black and white. You can't tell which of the cards are blue: the ones on the floor, or the table.Apollo: B-But look! You can see the colors in this photo!Phoenix: Yes, but when he said the cards were \"blue\"... ...it was well before this evidence came to light!Kristoph: It is true that the defendant was engaged in a game of poker with the victim. Yet it was only that: a game, in the purest sense. A competition, Your Honor.Payne: A... competition?Kristoph: Yes, a test of wits, a silent clash of passions... Only the cards, their backs wreathed in blue flame, know its final outcome.Phoenix: Well, Kristoph?Kristoph: ...Apollo: Mr.... Gavin?Judge: Mr. Gavin! I-Is something the matter?Kristoph: Hmm? N-No, nothing. Excuse me, it was just so... sudden. Wright. You aren't seriously accusing me... are you?Phoenix: Oh, Kristoph? You know even I'd never take a joke this far.Payne:Payne: This has gone beyond ridiculous, beyond dumb... This is insanity! The defendant accusing his own defense attorney of murder?Phoenix: I assure you, I'm quite sane.Payne: But what possible connection could Mr. Gavin have to the victim!?Phoenix: I wasn't aware that I had a connection to Mr. Smith, either.Payne: Yes, but Mr. Gavin and the victim have never even met!Phoenix: Well... What if they have?Payne: Huh...?Phoenix: There is a possibility, after all. They may have met that night, before the game started.Judge: What are you suggesting!?Apollo: (Is this the truth Mr. Wright was staying silent about!? Well, only one thing to do!) Mr. Wright! The defense would like to request that you testify to the court!Kristoph:Kristoph: The defense would like to request no such thing.Apollo: Mr. Gavin...?Kristoph: Testimonies must relate to the case. How could anything happening before that game of poker be related?Judge: I'm not sure I follow, Mr. Gavin.Kristoph: As I explained before, the defense believes that Ms. Orly...Judge: ...Am I to assume you speak for Mr. Justice in this? He is the defense, not you.Kristoph: ...!Judge: Mr. Justice. The matter of Mr. Wright's testimony is up to you.Apollo: Oh... OK. *gulp*Judge: Does the court, in your opinion, need to hear Mr. Wright's testimony?Hear the testimony Apollo: (This was Mr. Wright's strategy! He was planning this all along! And I intend to see it through.) ...The defense would like to request that Mr. Wright testify to the court! Kristoph: Et tu, Justice? You would betray me, your teacher? Apollo: I'm sorry, Mr. Gavin. This isn't about loyalty... This is about the truth! Kristoph: ... Judge: Very well. The defendant... Mr. Wright will take the stand, please. Leads to Witness TestimonyNo need Apollo: (As much as I'd like it to, I guess the testimony isn't related to the case, per se.) Phoenix: You heard what the judge said, Apollo? Apollo: ...! Phoenix: It's your decision. Yours. Kristoph: Justice! You aren't seriously considering... Apollo: I'm sorry, Mr. Gavin... (But now that we've gone this far, we might as well go all the way!) The defense would like to request that Mr. Wright testify to the court! Judge: Very well. The defendant, er, Mr. Wright will take the stand, please. Leads to Witness TestimonyWitness Testimony-- Appetite Before Murder --Phoenix: That evening, Kristoph and I had dinner. We sat at the table in the photograph. Shadi Smith walked in five minutes after Kristoph left. When the \"trap\" failed, Smith hit the waitress. The girl was knocked out cold, and Smith was uncontrollable. I left to call the police. When I returned, he was dead, blood streaming from a cut on his forehead. That's when I made another phone call... To Defense Attorney Gavin.Judge: Mr. Gavin! You were at the Borscht Bowl Club the night of the murder!?Phoenix: I dine with him rather frequently.Payne: A-And he talked to the defendant on the phone directly after the murder!?Phoenix: Quite against my will, I had become involved in a murder. I thought I might be in need of a lawyer, so I called him.Kristoph: You were planning this all along, weren't you, Wright? Just because you wanted to drag me into your little murder trial...Phoenix: The only thing I want... is the truth. As I did back then... and now.Kristoph: I thought my office was doing you a favor when we took on your defense. It appears that I was wrong.Judge: ...Very well. The defense may cross-examine the witness.Kristoph: Justice.Apollo: S-Sir!Kristoph: He's lying, and you're going to expose him.Apollo: Uh... Understood, sir. (Mr. Gavin vs. Mr. Wright... This can't end well. Why can't I have a normal trial!?)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Appetite Before Murder --Phoenix: That evening, Kristoph and I had dinner. We sat at the table in the photograph.Press Apollo: Apollo: You had dinner with Mr. Gavin? Phoenix: Yes, he dines with me at the Borscht Bowl Club quite frequently. We were enjoying a usual dinner at our usual spot... as usual. Apollo: \"Usual\"...? Phoenix: I always eat at the table closest to the piano. Judge: I see... Where Mr. Smith was sitting! Payne: So, the plates and such on the table were from your dinner? Phoenix: ...Indeed. The remnants of my meal with Kristoph. We dined for two hours, then Kristoph left. After that...Phoenix: Shadi Smith walked in five minutes after Kristoph left.Press Apollo: Apollo: Five minutes? So, the two of them could have passed in the restaurant during that time? Phoenix: That would have been a \"fateful encounter\" to be sure. Payne: Payne: Hee hee hee... Oh, Mr. Wright... What was it you said? Kristoph Gavin and Shadi Smith \"may have met\"...? Phoenix: I believe I did say that. Payne: Here I was all nervous about this \"meeting\"...And now we hear they just passed in the hall? Judge: Hmm... That does seem a little weak as a pretense for murder. Phoenix: Oh it would be. If that was all that really happened. Apollo: (C'mon, Mr. Wright... What are you hiding this time!?)Phoenix: When the \"trap\" failed, Smith hit the waitress.Press Apollo: Apollo: About this failed \"trap\"... This is the same \"trap\" that Ms. Olga Orly mentioned? Olga: The plan was simple. Elegant, really. You see, we set up a trap of sorts... I was to plant a card in Wright's pocket beforehand... ...and then deal five aces during one of their games. When their hands were revealed, Smith would call him out and search Wright. He would then pull out the planted card and the trap would snap shut! You swapped the cards! Olga: Just like that, the legend would be dashed to pieces. Phoenix: Yes... A harmless prank, in essence. It was by a quirk of fate that I happened to discover it... Payne: A \"quirk\"...? Phoenix: I happened to put a hand in my pocket... and found a card. Apollo: The card she planted! Phoenix: Yes, I snuck a peek at it and found it was the Five of Hearts. I had a feeling something might happen so I disposed of the card... before the game. Judge: Disposed... Where!? Phoenix: There was an empty bottle of grape juice I had been drinking right beside me. I threw the card inside the bottle. Payne: An empty bottle of grape juice... Apollo: The murder weapon!? Phoenix: Yes. I rolled it up and shoved it in. The colored glass makes it hard to see. Judge: Hmm... A battle of wits between the deceiver and the would-be deceived! That sounds like terrific drama... Apollo: (A card inside the murder weapon? That's strange... Did the police miss it in their investigation? Maybe I'll take a look...) Judge: Mr. Wright! The \"Poker Head of Courtroom No. 3\" approves of this battle of wits! Please revise your testimony with this new information. Changes statement from \"When the \"trap\" failed, Smith hit the waitress.\" to \"I discovered the \"trap\" during the game, and disposed of the card in the bottle.\"Phoenix: I discovered the \"trap\" during the game, and disposed of the card in the bottle.Press Apollo: Apollo: Why in the bottle? Phoenix: I perceived my opponent's intent immediately. I'm used to entrapment, you see. I knew what was coming. Judge: Hoh hoh... So you struck first! I like that. Phoenix: I know every trick in the book. They don't work on me. Apollo: (At least, when you get lucky and stick your hand in your pocket they don't.)Present Deadly Bottle (after examining bottom of bottle; before correctly presenting Crime Photo 1) Apollo: Apollo: Um, Mr. Wright, if I may? Phoenix: Yes? Apollo: I've examined the bottle, and I don't see any card in here. Phoenix: Hmm? No? ... Judge: What, Mr. Wright? Surely \"...\" isn't all you have to say for yourself!? Phoenix: I can't say that I know what happened to the card. I did put it in that bottle, however. Apollo: Huh...? Kristoph: Perhaps a fifth person came and took it out? Oh, and a sixth person could've helped! Judge: Mr. Gavin... Mr. Wright is your client! Kristoph: ...My apologies, Your Honor. Payne: I won't have you disparaging our investigation, either! We looked inside that bottle. There was nothing! Apollo: (...So what's going on? Is Mr. Wright hoodwinking us again? Or did the card just... disappear?) Judge: In any case, please continue the cross-examination. I'm afraid decisive contradictions call for decisive evidence. Apollo: Oh. Kristoph: Push him harder, Justice. Break him! It's just you and the witness in the ring. Go for the KO! Apollo: (Ugh. Why do I get the feeling we're not on our client's side anymore?)Present Deadly Bottle (after examining bottom of bottle; after correctly presenting Crime Photo 1) Apollo: Apollo: Um, Mr. Wright, if I may?

Leads to: \"I believe that's enough of that.\"Phoenix: The girl was knocked out cold, and Smith was uncontrollable. I left to call the police.Press Apollo: Apollo: You made the call to the police from the first floor of the restaurant, correct? Phoenix: Exactly. Cell phones don't get a signal down in the Hydeout. Apollo: Was anyone else on the first floor at that time? Phoenix: Not a soul. It was the middle of the night, after all. So there, in the darkened restaurant, I called the cops. After making the call, I returned to the Hydeout. It didn't seem right to leave the injured waitress alone.Phoenix: When I returned, he was dead, blood streaming from a cut on his forehead.Press Apollo: Apollo: And when you returned, the victim was already... Phoenix: Dead, yes. I'll admit, I was a little startled when I walked in. Judge: A... \"little\"? Phoenix: He was bleeding from his forehead, after all. Apollo: (I guess I'd be startled, too, if I walked in on a scene like that.)Present Crime Photo 1 (before correctly presenting Deadly Bottle) Apollo: Apollo: Mr. Wright, if I may. Phoenix: Yes? Apollo: Take a look at this photograph of the crime scene. See the victim here? He's wearing a hat. ...I wouldn't think you could see blood on his forehead. Phoenix: ... Good point. Kristoph: Justice! Next time you point out an inconsistency, put a little more \"oomph\" into it. Judge: Mr. Wright. Can you explain this to the court? Phoenix: Ah... I forgot to mention something. I was the one who put that hat on his head. Apollo: Eh...? Payne: You...? Judge: You put the hat on the dead man's head? Phoenix: He wore it through our entire poker game. After calling the police, when I returned to the scene, his head was in full view. Shining bright... Just like in this photograph. Judge: And...? Phoenix: I picked his hat up off the floor and put it on his head. Payne: Wh-Wh-Why'd you do a thing like that!? Phoenix: All I can say is... I'm sorry. But that's the only thing I touched at the crime scene. Apollo: So... Ms. Orly didn't see it? \"It\" being the victim's... er, his head. Phoenix: I'd think not. She was out cold. I believe I was the only one who witnessed his head. Kristoph: Ah, here we go again... Apollo: Mr. Gavin? Kristoph: Ahem. Pardon. It just seems that our client is determined to lie his way through this case. Judge: Hmm... Apollo: (H-Hey, he's still our client! ...Isn't he?) Judge: In any case, please continue the cross-examination. I'm afraid decisive contradictions call for decisive evidence. Apollo: Oh. Kristoph: Push him harder, Justice. Break him! It's just you and the witness in the ring. Go for the KO! Apollo: (Ugh. Why do I get the feeling we're not on our client's side anymore?)

Leads to: \"I believe that's enough of that.\"Phoenix: That's when I made another phone call... To Defense Attorney Gavin.Press Apollo: Apollo: Could you explain why you called Mr. Gavin...? Phoenix: I'd obviously gotten involved in a rather... sticky affair. And I figured Kristoph's law offices would give me a friend rate for my defense fees... Kristoph: Ah, glad to hear you intend to pay. Phoenix: Oh, I'll pay in full, Kristoph. It was I who got you involved, after all. Kristoph: ...You may find the price of your defense quite high, my good friend. Quite high.Apollo: (Is this the \"truth\" that Mr. Wright was talking about?)Kristoph: Justice, you know what you have to do.Kristoph: He's lying. Expose him. Now.Apollo: Y-Yes, sir... (I have to think! What's Mr. Wright trying to tell me with this testimony? The truth has to be in there somewhere!)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Kristoph Gavin\nDescription: Boss at Gavin Law Offices.

    "cot": "Okay, I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let me look through the provided materials.\n\nThe testimonies given by Phoenix Wright include statements about the events of the night. One key testimony is Testimony 3 where Phoenix says he disposed of the Five of Hearts card in the grape juice bottle (Deadly Bottle). The relevant evidence here is the Deadly Bottle (Evidence 3), which mentions that the bottle is empty and only has Wright's prints. However, the Crime Photo 1 (Evidence 2) shows the bottle on the table in the crime scene photo. If Phoenix put the card in the bottle, but the bottle is found empty, that's a contradiction. Also, the card wasn't found in the bottle during investigation. So when Phoenix testifies he put the card in the bottle (Testimony 3), but the Deadly Bottle evidence shows it's empty, they contradict. Therefore, Evidence 3 (Deadly Bottle) contradicts Testimony 3 (Phoenix's statement about disposing the card there)."

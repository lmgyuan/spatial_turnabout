    "prompt": "You are provided with a list of characters, evidences and testimonies.\nStory:\n...atching soap operas on TV. Phoenix: I'm not sure that's enough to make you a qualified anything, Maya... Ema: Oh, and by the way... I heard the suspect faced her fair share of harassment, too. And from the sound of it, it got pretty ugly for her. Phoenix: Hmm... So even though this incident could cause a huge scandal for the company... ...it might be a boon for those who opposed their marriage to begin with. After all, with Ellen's arrest and everything, the marriage is most definitely off now... Present Broken Lantern, Photo of Victim, or Gloomsbury's Note Ema: It's absolutely unbelievable. What kind of monster would plan to commit a murder on somebody's happiest day? Phoenix: I take it this means you don't have any significant new leads... Ema: No, I'm afraid not. You? Phoenix: I've got nothing. Ema: I wish I could be of more help. Phoenix: Well, thanks anyway. I appreciate it. All we can do is keep on keeping on, right? Time Keeper Phoenix: So you're sure this is the murder weapon in this case? Ema: Positive. The shape of the victim's injuries and the shape of this clock are a perfect match. Phoenix: I see... Ema: I daresay that if somebody were to get knocked over the head with this thing... ... it's more likely to cut off their future than send them to the past! Phoenix: I can't disagree with you there. Anything else Ema: Is there something I can do to help you with that? Phoenix: Actually, I was hoping it would help me move my investigation along... Ema: Sorry, but that's not going to do much for you here, I'm afraid. Phoenix: That's too bad... Ema: Aww, don't look so glum. You have to keep a positive outlook! Why don't you take a break with something sweet? I highly recommend Snackoos, myself. You want to try some? Phoenix: Uh, no thanks. I appreciate the offer, though. Ema: Suit yourself... You don't know what you're missing. After clearing all Talk options and examining wallet, intact Pegabull lantern, fog machine below model hot-air balloon, bloody valve, body outline, petal, and note: Phoenix: Well, I guess that just about does it for the crime scene. Maya: Hey, Nick. I want to see the rest of the airship! We might as well, since we're here! Phoenix: (True. We might even run into some of the other people involved in the case.) ???: ............ Phoenix: ! Maya: N-Nick, how long has that guy been standing there? Phoenix: (I didn't even notice him until just now.) Excuse me. Are you with Sprocket Aviation? ???: ............... Phoenix: Huh? Maya: Nick! He wrote something on that paper airplane! Phoenix: I guess we're supposed to read it, then? ???: ............... Phoenix: Let's see here... \"Get out, intruders.\" (Well! That was a rather cold welcome.) Ema: Mr. Wright, Maya, meet the lone son of the president of Sprocket Aviation... ...Sorin Sprocket. Or, to put it another way: the future president of Sprocket Aviation. Phoenix: So he's Ellen's fianc\u00e9? Sorin: ............ Phoenix: Oh, there he goes... Ema: He's kind of an eccentric. I hear he's the genius inventor behind many of Sprocket Aviation's business successes. Phoenix: An inventor, huh...? Ema: Yup. He even designed this airship. Phoenix: That's pretty impressive. Maya: Nick! This is no time to be standing around gawking! We have to go after him! We need to ask him some questions about Ellen! Phoenix: Oh. R-Right. (It looked like he was heading outside.) Wright Anything Agency or Detention Center Present Broken Lantern Maya: This poor Pegabull. He used to be so handsome, and now look at him. I wonder if I can fix him? Phoenix: W-Wait, Maya! You can't tamper with important evidence like that! So don't even think about it! Maya: ...I bet Ema would let me do it if I asked! Phoenix: It's not like building a plastic model, you know. Just leave it to the professionals. Maya: I guess you're right. But I could've remodeled him into something even cooler! Phoenix: (I'm pretty sure \"remodeling\" falls under the category of \"evidence tampering,\" too.) Photo of Victim Maya: I'm dying to find out who killed Mister Doom-n'-Gloom. So let's hurry up and find some evidence, and solve this case already! Phoenix: Then why don't you lend me a hand? Maya: What do you think I'm doing here! Now, let's find the truth together! Gloomsbury's Note Maya: Ol' Gloomsy's handwriting sure is neater than mine. Phoenix: Maybe it's because the other servants had to be able to read his writing, too? Maya: But some of the words in this are smudged. Phoenix: I guess he rubbed them with his hand as he was writing. Judging by the content, I'm guessing he wasn't in the best frame of mind when he wrote it. Maya: I'll say... A scary note like this would rub anyone the wrong way... Time Keeper Phoenix: The Time Keeper... If you really CAN travel through time with this thing, I'd go back to before the incident. Maya: That's it? Come on, Nick! You can think bigger than that! We could go back to the age of the dinosaurs! Or even the heyday of samurais and ninjas! Can you imagine how much fun it would be?! Phoenix: (I can imagine how much it would screw up our present day...) September 21Sprocket Park - Mooring Dock Phoenix: There he is. Excuse me. Could we talk to you? Sorin: ............ Phoenix: Excuse me. Do you mind if I ask what you're doing? Sorin: ............! ............ Maya: H-He sure is writing up a storm! Sorin: It IS possible. If an enormous change in mass could be detected at that observation point... ...then theoretically, matter can retain its form, even as it crosses the event horizon... Phoenix: L-Let's just see what he has to say about Ellen... Talk Ellen Phoenix: Excuse me, but we'll be representing Ellen in court tomorrow... ...so, could we ask you about the case? Sorin: ............ ............ Phoenix: ...Ow! Wh-What the...? \"Not interested.\" \"Not interested\"?! How can you say something like that?! Maya: This is about your fianc\u00e9e! She's under arrest, you know! Sorin: ............ ...The diameter of the airship is approximately eighty feet. The amount of energy necessary to move matter comprised of that amount of mass is... Phoenix: He's off in his own little world. Maya: I can't believe he said he was \"not interested\" in talking about his own bride's arrest! Phoenix: We'll just have to talk on his level, then, with something he might be interested in. Ellen (after clearing \"Ellen\" Talk option and presenting Ellen's Pendant) Phoenix: We'd like to ask you about Ellen's case, if you don't mind. Sorin: ............ I don't know a thing about it, so why don't you go ask the police? Phoenix: (In other words, \"Not interested\"...) Maya: This guy is the worst! Now I feel sorry for poor Ellen. Phoenix: In that case, can I ask you about how Ellen traveled through time? Sorin: ............ Go on. Phoenix: Guess that got your attention... Maya: So... is time travel really even possible? Sorin: Yes, it IS possible. Phoenix: (A-All righty, then...) Sorin: At the same time, it is also impossible. The pendant I gave Ellen... ...is not supposed to operate as a time machine by itself. Phoenix: What do you mean? Sorin: The Time Keeper, that clock we had displayed in the reception hall... ...THAT is the body of the time machine. The pendant is simply a part. Maya: That clock was the murder weapon, wasn't it? But it's a time machine, too? Sorin: What Ellen experienced is akin to traveling down a road by car key. Physically and metaphysically, it should be impossible. ......Unless... maybe the quantum system inside the pendant... ...somehow accidentally interfered with the natural flow of the fourth dimension...? Phoenix: ......We're losing him again... ...Maybe we'd better ask him some more about the time machine. The time machine (appears after \"Ellen\") Leads to: \"So you've been researching time travel, have you?\" Present Ellen's Pendant or Time Keeper (before clearing \"Ellen\" Talk option) Sorin: ......... What are you showing me that for? ............ ............ Phoenix: Mr. Sprocket! Sorin: ........... Phoenix: (I can't read him at all. Not even with an item as loaded with sentiments as this...) Ellen's Pendant (after clearing \"Ellen\" Talk option) Phoenix: Could you take a look at this? Sorin: ! I-Is that... Ellen's? Phoenix: Ellen told us that she traveled through time during the incident. She said it happened after she made a wish on this pendant. Sorin: ...... You mean to say you two are Ellen's lawyers? Phoenix: ...Yes. I told you that just a minute ago. Sorin: Sorry. I was lost in thought. Maya: He wasn't even listening? Phoenix: Oh, boy. (He's not at all what I expected... based on Ellen's gushing testimonial, anyway...) Anything else Sorin: ............ ............ Phoenix: Does this bring anything to mind? Sorin: ............ ........... Phoenix: Even some small, vague detail will do... Sorin: ........... ............ Phoenix: Ack! (This guy really doesn't want to talk, does he?) Phoenix: So you've been researching time travel, have you? Sorin: Moving through the space-time continuum would be man's ultimate means of travel. Phoenix: Time travel as a mode of transportation? Sorin: Since the dawn of time, man has developed multifarious methods of transportation. Horses, steam engines, gas engines, airplanes, spaceships... But they are all fundamentally similar, in that they constitute three-dimensional movement. Travel through the space-time continuum would shift mankind into a new paradigm. Maya: ......I don't know why, Nick, but I'm getting awfully sleepy all of a sudden... (Changed from [......I don't why, [sic] Nick, but I'm getting awfully sleepy all of a sudden...] in the original release) Sorin: For generations, Sprocket Aviation has advanced the development of transportation. Therefore, it's only natural that I would research time travel as man's next great leap. Maya: *yaaaaawn* Oh! Is he done? So what exactly does all that stuff he was saying mean, Nick? Phoenix: Well, basically, it's like taking a hamburger joint... and adding a drive-thru to it, I guess? Maya: Oh, I get it! It's the same burger, but with a quicker and more efficient delivery system! So what Sorin really wants to do is... ...lunch humanity into the future! Sorin: \"Launch,\" not \"lunch.\" Phoenix: But do you really believe that time travel is possible? Sorin: It only becomes truly impossible when man stops daring to believe. Besides... time travelers do exist, you know. But you wouldn't understand. Maya: Did you hear that, Nick? Time travelers really do exist! Phoenix: All I know is, Sorin isn't the easiest guy to wrap your head around... Maya: Oh, I don't know. I kind of like the way he talks. It's full of hope for the future! He's more passionate than I thought, too... When it comes to inventions, anyway. Phoenix: (Yeah. His apparent lack of concern for Ellen is troubling, though...) So, I hear that the rest of the Sprocket family was opposed to your marriage. What are your thoughts on that? Sorin: ...............I... ???: Master Sorin. It is time for the meeting on next term's project. Sorin: ............ ???: What is this? Daydreaming about your inventions again? Tut, tut. You are the future president. You must consider the business side, too. It is I. I found Sorin. Send the car over at once. Sorin: ......I'm not interested. ???: Oh, Master Sorin. You do give me quite the headache at times. In any case, your attendant is waiting. Please go to him now. Sorin: ............ Phoenix: Excuse me, but who are you? ???: Oh, where are my manners? My name is Pierce Nichody. Please call me Pierce. I am the Sprocket family butler. Maya: N-Nick! A butler! I didn't know they actually still existed! I thought they were just on TV and stuff! Nichody: And who might you be, if you don't mind my asking? Phoenix: Oh, I'm Phoenix Wright, Ellen Wyatt's lawyer. Maya: And I'm his assistant, Maya Fey. I'm a spirit medium. Nichody: Oh! So it is you. I am most grateful to you for taking on Miss Ellen's defense. You have my sincerest thanks. Phoenix: D-Don't mention it. So hey, speaking of the case... Nichody: Oh. One moment, please. ............ Maya: Wow! What a beautiful pocket watch! Nichody: Oh, this? It's just a bit of a good luck charm. Phoenix: (That's one expensive good luck charm... But I guess it makes sense. Knowing the time is pretty important in his line of work. So I guess that pocket watch is as important to him as my attorney's badge is to me.) Nichody: There is a little time before I must attend to Master Sorin again. Why not come to Sprocket Manor? Phoenix: Huh? You mean, to Sorin's home? Nichody: As a token of appreciation for taking on Miss Ellen's defense... ...I would like to serve you some delicious tea and refreshments. Maya: Oh, boy, Nick! A fancy high-society tea party! With high-class snacks and everything! Phoenix: And what about the investigation?! Maya: Are you kidding? What better place to investigate next than Sorin's house?! Phoenix: I don't know. Do you really think his house is going to give us any new leads? Maya: Of course it will! I say we take the butler up on his kind offer and go to Sorin's place! Phoenix: All right, all right. You win. Nichody: Very good. To Sprocket Manor, then. September 21Sprocket Manor - Foyer Maya: Wow! This place does NOT disappoint! Ooh, I'm so excited! Phoenix: Whoa! Slow down, Maya! The mansion isn't going anywhere! Nichody: Now, then. We won't have to worry about anyone untoward eavesdropping here. I take it you wanted to ask me some questions...? Phoenix: Huh?! ......THAT'S why you invited us here?! Nichody: I am sorry to have tricked you like this. But this IS a murder, after all. I couldn't talk openly about it in public and risk sullying the Sprocket family's reputation. Maya: Aww... And I was REALLY looking forward to all those fancy snacks, too... Phoenix: There, there, Maya. Don't cry. (Hmm... This Pierce guy is one shrewd man...) Maya: Hey, Nick! Look at that cute vintage radio! Phoenix: (Radio...? Oh, that thing under there, under the stuffed bull's head.) Maya: I'm gonna take a closer look! *CRASH* Phoenix: I thought I told you to settle down... Maya: I'm sorry... Nichody: Not to worry. Phoenix: (Wow, that little mech fixed it right up!) Nichody: I am not only the butler, but I'm also Sprocket Aviation's repair department director. One might say that \"patching things up\" is my specialty. Maya: That was incredible! What IS that little doohickey on your shoulder, anyway? NIchody: It's my \"FXR-UPR\" shoulder mech. Master Sorin made it for me. It has too many features and functions to effectively enumerate at the moment, though. Maya: That's so cool! I wish I had one of those! Nichody: Fixing things is a simple matter. But fixing people is a different matter... Even a skilled physician can't bring back the dead. Oh, but forgive me. I seem to have gotten sidetracked. Phoenix: (He must be in shock over Mr. Gloomsbury's death... Still, I do need to ask him some questions about the case. I should take a look around and see what I can find out while I'm here, too.) Examine Bull head Phoenix: A bull... Come to think of it, there was a bull logo on the side of the Flying Chapel, too. Maya: The president of the company must have a thing for cattle! Lady: The bull is the symbol of Sprocket Aviation. \"To be as strong and steady as a bull.\" That's the company creed, you know. Phoenix: (Probably for all the back-breaking labor they put their employees through...) Lady: By the way, that bull logo on the Flying Chapel -- the one with the rainbow wings? His name is \"Rainy the Rainbull.\" Get it? Maya: I get it! He's a rainbow-colored bull, so he's a \"Rainbull,\" right? What a memorable name, huh, Nick! Phoenix: (Yeah, for the lameness of the pun...) Radio Phoenix: Don't you dare touch that radio again. It looks like an expensive antique. Maya: What are you worried about? If it breaks again, Pierce will just fix it up again! Phoenix: (I really hope he's nice enough to waive the repair bill...) Propeller Maya: Nick! Look at that airplane propeller up there going round and round! Phoenix: I see they've got an aviation theme going on. Makes sense for an airline family. I wonder if it doubles as a fan. Maya: Ooh! What if the rest of the plane were on the other side of the wall?! And the wall would open up so the plane could take off in an emergency! How cool would that be! Phoenix: If that's what's behind the propeller wall, then what's behind the bull wall across the way? Oh, I know! Maybe it's the rest of him! That must be where the Sprockets get their milk! Maya: Nick... First of all, that's a beef cow. And second, bulls don't make milk. Phoenix: Oh. Right... (That's what I get for trying to play along...) Bouquet Phoenix: Oh, it's the bridal bouquet. Maya: Hey Nick, how about I throw it, and you try to catch it? Phoenix: Why me? Maya: Just because. I bet you'd look hilarious flailing around trying to grab it. Phoenix: But doesn't tradition dictate that it's the ladies that go after the bouquet? Maya: Who cares! Just catch it! Here! Phoenix: Ow! H-Hey! You threw that right at my face! Lady: Oh, you don't want to catch THAT bouquet. Trust me. Maya: Why not? Lady: They say it's bad luck to catch the bouquet of a marriage that doesn't last. Phoenix: B-But I already caught it... Maya: Whoops. Too late now, huh, Nick. Phoenix: ............ Film camera or photos on table Phoenix: Oh, are those pictures of the wedding reception? Man: Yes, I took them with my trusty camera here. Maya: Um... do you mind if we have a look at that photo? Man: Be my guest! Take as long of a look as you'd like. Well, what do you think of this gorgeous dreamscape? A thick fog billows across the room, making it look as if the couple were walking on clouds. Maya: Wow... Look at how beautiful Ellen is here! She looks a little nervous, though. Phoenix: She does, doesn't she. Maya: Hey, look! There's Pierce! Phoenix: Really? Where? Maya: Right there, behind the sweetheart table! Phoenix: Hey, you're right. I bet he was there attending to the happy couple the whole dinner. Maya: So, what do you think, Nick? Does anything in this photo stick out at you? Phoenix: No, not at the moment, anyway. Photo of Reception added to the Court Record. Maya: Hey, Nick? If Ellen really did travel back in time... ...do you think this photo is of the second reception -- you know, after the time jump? Phoenix: Hmm... I wonder. Excuse me. Sir? Man: Yes? Can I help you? Phoenix: Ellen told us she traveled back in time. Would you happen to know anything about that? Man: Oh, um... N-No... I-I... I-I haven't the foggiest idea what you're talking about! Phoenix: ? (He clammed up faster than a clam!) Film camera or photos on table (subsequent times) Phoenix: You don't see cameras like this anymore. Maya: That's for sure! Cameras these days are so small and easy to use. But these old retro ones are cool, too! Man: I'm glad to hear you appreciate them. *ahem* This camera was made in the late 1800s. As for this particular model, it is... Phoenix: S-Sorry! We'd really like to hear more about your camera, but we have to go. Maya: Aww, Nick! But it sounds so interesting! Phoenix: We have to get back to our investigation, remember? (Preferably before we get our ears talked off!) Man: Oh, what a shame. We'll have to get together and talk some other time, then. Over tea, perhaps? Card on floor Phoenix: Excuse me, but there's a card here on the floor. Man: Well, look at that. It's a Flying Chapel key card. Phoenix: The Flying Chapel? What areas on the Flying Chapel require a key card, if I may ask? Man: Mostly areas we want to keep the public out of... ...such as the staff room and the hold, which is chock full of machinery. Phoenix: So you can't enter those areas without a key card? Man: That's right... Hm? This one here belongs to Ellen. Phoenix: (Wait, what's Ellen's key card doing here?) Did Ellen come back here after the incident occurred? Man: I don't believe so. And she was arrested by the police straight away this morning. Although... there was a strange man with a gaudy jacket in here earlier. Phoenix: Was that man... wearing a beret, by any chance? Man: Yes, he was, as a matter of fact! He was also wearing sunglasses and a fake mustache! Phoenix: (I knew it... The only question is, what was he doing here?) Card on floor (subsequent times) Phoenix: Um... Would you like me to pick up that key card? It's pretty important, isn't it? Man: No, that's all right. I'm waiting for that new maid over there to notice it. Phoenix: I-I see. Man: It's a part of our training process for new servants, so please don't help her. Don't worry. I'll keep an eye on the key card. Phoenix: All right... (The Sprocket household sure runs a tight airship...) Framed photo Maya: Hey, Nick! Now, here's a real lady! Phoenix: She looks smart as a whip, doesn't she? Maya: I wonder who she is? We didn't see her on the airship... Man: That is Selena Sprocket... Sorin's elder sister. Beautiful and capable, she was a great lady. Phoenix: Sorin's sister... Hmm... I think I see the resemblance. (Maybe I'll show Pierce this photo later and ask him about her.) Selena Sprocket Photo added to the Court Record. Framed photo (subsequent times) Maya: Hey, Nick! Now, here's a real lady! Phoenix: She looks smart as a whip, doesn't she? Maya: I wonder who she is? We didn't see her on the airship... Man: That is Selena Sprocket... Sorin's elder sister. Beautiful and capable, she was a great lady. Phoenix: Sorin's sister... Hmm... I think I see the resemblance. Talk The incident Nichody: About the incident Miss Ellen was arrested for... ...do you think she did it? Phoenix: Well, I can't prove it yet, but no, I don't think she could've done it. I guess you could call it a gut feeling. Nichody: ...... I see. I guess we have different opinions, then. Phoenix: Do we, now? Nichody: The prosecution says that when Gloomsbury attacked Miss Ellen, she fought back... ...and ended up killing him. I agree with this perspective. Or rather, that is the consensus of the entire Sprocket family. Phoenix: ...Even so, I heard an interesting story from Chief Prosecutor Edgeworth. I heard that the Sprocket family had tried to pressure the Prosecutor's Office... ...into burying this case. Nichody: I fear you are mistaken. All we sought was merely a legal consultation. Besides, none of it matters now, as she is no longer a part of this family. Fortunately for us, they had yet to get their marriage license before holding the banquet. Phoenix: (So basically, once they realized they couldn't sway the prosecution, they cut her loose...) Nichody: ......I realize how callous I must sound. But my duty is to protect the Sprocket family, and more specifically... ...Sprocket Aviation's future and Master Sorin, whose genius is essential to the company. I will do anything to achieve that goal. That is my job as the Sprocket family butler. Maya: You know, I think Pierce and Mr. Edgeworth would get along really well. Don't you think? Phoenix: Yeah. I could easily picture Edgeworth with a butler. Nichody: Oh, and by the way... I suppose I should tell you about this as well... It's about when the members of the extended family and I discovered the crime. Time travel Phoenix: Um, did Ellen say anything to you about traveling through time? Nichody: ...She must have been delirious. There is no need to take such a claim seriously. Phoenix: Sorin himself said that time travel was possible, though. Nichody: ! ......Master Sorin... said that? ......It sounds like he is still stuck in the past. Phoenix: (He's psychologically stuck, I take it...) *ring* *ring* Nichody: Excuse me. What is it? ............I see. I believe I told you the madam will be having milk tea. Still, have lemon slices at the ready, just in case. We must not disappoint her, understand? Phoenix: You sure are busy. Nichody: All in a day's work. ...Still, we really do need Master Sorin to start focusing on the business side of things soon. Phoenix: Um, could you tell us about that thing you mentioned about Sorin's past? Nichody: There is something in Master Sorin's past that he wishes he could change... Please forgive me. This isn't something I should be sharing with strangers. Phoenix: (Now I really want to know what Sorin's still hung up on...) Discovering the crime (appears after \"The incident\") Nichody: It was sometime after the reception. Some of the master's relatives and I went to clean up the reception hall... ...and that is when we saw it. A woman standing in front of the victim with the bloody murder weapon in her hand... It was none other than Miss Ellen. Phoenix: But, Pierce, it wasn't what it looked like! Maya: That's right! She just happened to find the body! Nichody: I do not know what Miss Ellen has told you, but what we witnessed... ... was unmistakably the moment immediately after the deed had been committed. Phoenix: Nngh... Nichody: And that is what I told the police who came in response to my call. Phoenix: I-I see... (So Pierce was the one who reported it to the police, huh?) Sorin's past (appears after presenting Selena Sprocket Photo) Nichody: Master Sorin will become the next president of Sprocket Aviation. However, that wasn't always so. Miss Selena Sprocket, Master Sorin's elder sister, was next in line. Maya: So why isn't she becoming the next president? Nichody: ......Because she died... in a car accident. Maya: What?! Phoenix: I-I had no idea...! Nichody: Actually, Master Sorin was also in the car with her at the time of the accident. Losing the sister he loved right before his eyes devastated him. Ever since then, he has buried himself in his research on time machines. He also became a quiet and meticulous -- almost compulsive -- note-taker around then. Maya: He seems so stiff and robotic -- I had no idea he was carrying all that around inside him... Nichody: Master Sorin has abandoned the company business and spends all his time on inventions. As the family butler, I am truly concerned. I believe it is high time he let go of the past. Present Ellen's Pendant or Time Keeper Nichody: Master Sorin made the Time Keeper as a symbol of their love for each other. ...A symbol now tainted with blood. I can only imagine how shocking this must be for Master Sorin. Phoenix: But surely Sorin believes in the woman he loves. Nichody: Master Sorin has the future of Sprocket Aviation to think about. He cannot afford to let his personal feelings affect his judgment. Phoenix: Th-That's awful! Nichody: You might think so, but that's the kind of responsibility he must bear. Phoenix: (All because he's in line to be the next president, huh? Sounds like it's not going to be easy to find out how Sorin really feels about anything...) Flying Chapel Pamphlet or Photo of Reception Nichody: This incident has severely damaged the company's reputation. I expect reservations for weddings on the Flying Chapel will face an unfortunate decline. Phoenix: Pierce, you just lost a subordinate... ...yet, all you can think about is the business? Nichody: I am not made of stone, I assure you. But if this company were to go under because of this incident... ...countless employees would lose their jobs. Phoenix: I-I see... Nichody: To be honest, I wish we could have hidden this tragedy from the public... ...but now that it's going to trial, I suppose there is nothing to be done about it. Phoenix: (So the fate of this company depends on this trial... This is more than I bargained for...) Photo of Victim or Gloomsbury's Note Nichody: Gloomsbury... How could he do something so deranged? It is truly a shame. As a servant, he was a cut above the rest. Phoenix: Mr. Gloomsbury worked under you, correct? Were there any signs that he was going to do anything like that to Ellen? Nichody: No, he gave no indication whatsoever. If only I'd realized what he was up to sooner... Phoenix: I-I see... Selena Sprocket Photo Phoenix: Pierce, the woman in this photo is Sorin's older sister Selena, right? I don't think we've met her yet. Nichody: Yes, about that... Phoenix: (He seems... hesitant, all of a sudden.) If you wouldn't mind... ...could you tell us about her? Nichody: A-All right. Very well. She's a big part of Master Sorin's past, after all... Phoenix: Sorin's... past? Anything else Nichody: And what is this? Phoenix: Just wondering if there is anything you can tell me about it. Nichody: Hmm... I'm afraid not. Phoenix: I-I see. Nichody: Time is money, as they say, so perhaps you should learn to spend it more wisely. Phoenix: R-Right. (Good advice, but his chilly attitude is giving me some serious goose bumps...) After clearing all Talk options and examining bouquet, film camera or photos on table, and card on floor: ???: Hey, Nick! What are you doing here? Phoenix: Larry? Larry: Oh, man! Edgey gave me a heckuva hard time! Phoenix: Larry, what are YOU doing here? Larry: I came to promote my new character, Cupiglet! I was hoping Sprocket Aviation would do some kind of tie-in with me for it! Maya: Wow. I didn't know Larry was such an aggressive businessman. You could learn a thing or two from him, Nick. Why don't you promote your agency to them? Phoenix: Now's not exactly the time for that, in case you haven't noticed. Maya: See? And this is why you'll never be rich! Phoenix: Actually, Larry, I've been meaning to ask you something. You were on the Flying Chapel yesterday, right? Larry: Huh? Was I...? Er... Phoenix: What were you doing there? Larry: N-Nothing... Phoenix: Whatever it was, I bet it wasn't anything to be proud of. But never mind that. Did you see anything that had to do with the case? ......Scratch that. Let's start with, you weren't INVOLVED in this case, were you? Larry: ! ............ Phoenix: Larry...? Maya: Hey! He took off! Phoenix: I just knew it... When something smells, it's usually the Butz... Come on, Maya! After him! Nichody: Oh, are you leaving so soon? Phoenix: We, uh, have to run... Thank you for making time for us. Nichody: I know you have to investigate, but please try to spare the family's feelings as you do. Phoenix: Y-Yes, of course. September 21Sprocket Park - Mooring Dock Phoenix: There he is. Hey, Larry! Larry: H-Hey, there, friend! Fancy meeting you here! Phoenix: There's nothing \"fancy\" about it. All we did was follow you. So, tell me, Larry. Why did you run away like that? Larry: Huh? Me? ...I don't know what you're talking about. A bolt of inspiration for my new picture book hit me and I had to run is all. It was, like, a \"Cupiphany!\" You dig? Phoenix: Riiiiight... Maya: He's just going to keep on playing dumb, isn't he, Nick? Talk What you saw on the airship Phoenix: Come on, Larry. I know you were on that airship, so what did you see? Larry: I-I didn't see anything! I didn't see anything 'cause I was never on that stupid airship! 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: ! Psyche-Locks... Larry: You say something? Phoenix: (The spiritual power of this magatama allows me to see... ...these mystical locks that appear when someone is trying to hide something from me. They're called \"Psyche-Locks,\" and when I see them... ...I simply present the magatama ([X / Y / R]) to try my hand at breaking them. (Changed from [...I simply touch the magatama (X) to try my hand at breaking them.] in the original release) If I can unlock them, I'm sure to finally get a straight answer out of him!) Present Magatama Phoenix: 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- What Larry Is Hiding -- Phoenix: This is no time for games, Larry. I WILL find out what you're hiding. Larry: I'm telling ya, Nick, you've got it all wrong. I've got nothing to do with this case, whatsoever! Phoenix: (Oh, come on, Larry! Even a baby could see through such a blatant and obvious lie.) \"Nothing whatsoever,\" huh? If you weren't involved, Larry, then you wouldn't have been involved with this person. Present Ellen Wyatt profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"You're the one who brought Ellen to my office in the first place.\" Present anyone else Phoenix: Larry: Huh? What are you trying to say, Nick? Phoenix: (Oops. Looks like I got it wrong.) J-Just ignore I said that! Larry: Jeez. Get a grip, will ya? Leads back to: \"If you weren't involved, Larry, then you wouldn't have been involved with this person.\" Phoenix: You're the one who brought Ellen to my office in the first place. ...And all those cops. Larry: Um... Phoenix: \"Nothing to do with the case, whatsoever\" isn't gonna cut it this time, Larry! If you have to lie, at least do a better job of it! Larry: U... UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! 1 LOCK BROKEN Larry: D-Don't diss me, Nick! If you're so convinced I'm lying, then lemme ask you this! What makes you think I was on that stupid ol' airship, anyway?! Lemme see some proof! If you've got any! Phoenix: Doubling down, are you? Fine. You want proof, Larry? Here's proof that you were on that airship! Present Business Card Wallet Phoenix: Leads to: \"Uh-oh!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Larry: You call that proof? Hmph. Phoenix: (Argh! I must've gotten it wrong!) Larry: Seriously, Nick. You shouldn't doubt your friends like this. It only hurts the both of us. Phoenix: (I'd better try that again.) Leads back to: \"You want proof, Larry? Here's proof that you were on that airship!\" Larry: Uh-oh! Phoenix: This is your business card wallet, isn't it, Larry? I found it in the reception hall. Larry: Gah! Phoenix: Time to come clean, Larry Butz. What exactly are you hiding? Larry: W-WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! ...... A-All right! Fine! Ya got me! I'll tell you everything! 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful What you saw on the airship (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Phoenix: Larry, what were you doing on that airship, anyway? Larry: Well, I went there to deliver the \"Welcome to Our Wedding\" sign they ordered from me. Phoenix: Huh. I didn't know you took on real jobs like that, too. Larry: Well, for your information, my wedding welcome signs are very popular on the Net! Phoenix: And that's how you met Ellen? Larry: Uh-huh. I mean, I'd seen her in the photo for the welcome sign, but seeing her in person... The way she smiled at me and said, \"Thank you\"... *sigh* I felt like I'd been hit by lightning! Phoenix: And that's when you fell in love with somebody else's bride, huh? So, were you invited to the reception? Larry: Can you believe they told me only family and relatives could attend?! They wouldn't even let me into the reception hall! Phoenix: (Smart move on their part, I'd say.) Larry: I got upset, and started wandering around the airship. That must be when I dropped my business card wallet. Phoenix: (So somebody else must've found it... ...and brought it to the reception hall, then.) Larry: But you know what? I saw something incredible while I was on that Flying Chapel! Phoenix: Like...? Larry: Get a load of this! Phoenix: Wh-What the heck is this? Larry: Whaddaya mean, \"what is this\"? Isn't it obvious? It's a drawing! I sketched a picture of one of the cabins on the airship. Phoenix: So what's so incredible about a cabin? Larry: Look at what was outside the window! It's one of those flying dinosaurs -- a real live pterodactyl! I looked out the cabin window and there it was, just flying out there! That airship traveled through time, I tell you! Phoenix: Wh-Wh... Maya: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Larry: When I told that Pierce butler guy about it... ...he told me to never mention it to anybody ever again. Phoenix: But why would he try to keep you from spouting what is clearly just nonsense? Larry: Maybe Sprocket Aviation is secretly developing a time machine! Phoenix: ......N-No way... Maya: N-Nick, this case is... ...totally amazing! Larry! You didn't tell Mr. Edgeworth about this, did you? Larry: Of course not! Edgey would just roll his eyes and think I was off my rocker. I didn't even tell him I was wandering around on the airship. I told him I met Elly at the mooring dock and we ran away together. Phoenix: Yeah... I can see Edgeworth's eyes rolling right out of his head had he heard about this. Larry's Drawing added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (So Larry also experienced the time slip somehow... But how is that possible...?) Larry: Hey, Nick. I'll be taking my card wallet back now, if you don't mind. Business Card Wallet swiped back by Larry. Larry: Oh, yeah. This is for you. Phoenix: What is it? Larry: It's a picture of the hold. I took it when I was wandering around on the airship. See? There's Elly right there in the middle. Phoenix: Um, the hold? Larry: Yeah, see? It's right here on the diagram. Phoenix: Okay. So now I know where the hold is. But what was Ellen doing there? Larry: Well, they were using it as a prepping area for the reception. Phoenix: I see. And around when did you take this? Larry: Before the reception. I took it while Elly was getting everything ready. Phoenix: So this was taken before the incident occurred... I don't know if it'll be of any help, but thanks for this anyway. Photo of Hold added to the Court Record. Phoenix: By the way, Larry. I heard that the door to the hold is controlled by a security system. So how'd you get in there? Larry: Th-That's...! A trade secret! Can't tell ya! Phoenix: (And the hits just keep on coming...) Well, I guess that's basically a wrap on the investigation. Maya: Not quite, Nick! I want to meet Ellen, too! Phoenix: Oh, that's right. You haven't met her yet, have you? Okay. Let's head over to the detention center, so you can say hi. What you saw on the airship (subsequent times) Phoenix: Larry, what were you doing on that airship, anyway? Larry: Well, I went there to deliver the \"Welcome to Our Wedding\" sign they ordered from me. Phoenix: Huh. I didn't know you took on real jobs like that, too. Larry: Well, for your information, my wedding welcome signs are very popular on the Net! Phoenix: And that's how you met Ellen? Larry: Uh-huh. I mean, I'd seen her in the photo for the welcome sign, but seeing her in person... The way she smiled at me and said, \"Thank you\"... *sigh* I felt like I'd been hit by lightning!

I didn't even tell him I was wandering around on the airship. I told him I met Elly at the mooring dock and we ran away together. Phoenix: Yeah... I can see Edgeworth's eyes rolling right out of his head had he heard about this. Present Business Card Wallet Phoenix: I found this in the reception hall. Larry: ........... Say, that's a pretty stylish wallet, ain't it? Phoenix: Have you ever seen it before? Larry: ............Nope. Phoenix: (I'll take that as a \"yes\"... Which means he must be trying to hide something from me.) Larry: I-I don't know anything about that wallet! Phoenix: (I'll just have to take him to task later...) Selena Sprocket Photo Larry: Whoooooooa! Who is she? Who is this lovely vision? Phoenix: Larry... *sigh* This is Sorin's older sister. She died in a car accident. Larry: Nooooooooo! How could such a beautiful flame have been snuffed out like that?! If she were alive today, I bet I could've made her happy. Phoenix: That's funny. I thought you were in love with Ellen? Larry: Don't get me wrong, Nick. I just wanna make all the pretty ladies of this world happy, that's all! Phoenix: I-I think you're the one getting it wrong... Anything else (before breaking Psyche-Locks) Larry: Hm? Do you really think you can prove Elly's innocence with that? Phoenix: If I knew, I wouldn't need to conduct an investigation, now would I? Now, look at the evidence, Larry! Can you tell me anything about it? Larry: Hmm.... Hmmmmmmmmmmm... Hmm... Nope. Sorry! Can't think of a thing. Phoenix: (Good thing I had low expectations from the start then...) Business Card Wallet (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Larry: All right, I admit it! That super stylish business card wallet is mine! What more do you want outta me?! ...Wait. Don't tell me you were hoping to keep it for yourself? Phoenix: Why would I want a card wallet with your face on it?! Larry: Aww, don't be shy! Tell you what, Nick. I'll have one sent to your office. I'll even throw in a \"good friend discount\" on it, too. Phoenix: I'd still have to pay?! (Trucy's going to take it out of my hide, too, once she sees that in the expenses book.) Larry's Drawing Larry: Hey! That's the drawing I made. You'd better take care of it. I bet it's gonna be valuable some day! Oh, do you want me to add a character or something to it? Maya: Ooh, could you? I'd love to see a true artist at work! Phoenix: Hold it! As farcical as this drawing is, there will be no doodling on the evidence until the trial is over. Larry: Wh-Whaddaya mean, \"farcical\"?! I'm never gonna draw anything for you ever again! Not even if you beg me! Maya: Aww... Guess that's that, huh, Nick? Phoenix: (Need I remind you that it's still a piece of evidence, Maya...?) Anything else (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Larry: What are you showing me that for? Is this an interrogation? Okay, sure, I snuck onto that airship and was wandering around it all by my lonesome. But you gotta believe me! I didn't kill anybody! Phoenix: And WHY were you sneaking around on that airship in the first place? Larry: Because... it was fate...? Yeah, that's it! I was just following my destiny! That's all I've ever done! Phoenix: (Oh, come on, Larry... Are you seriously going to blame all the trouble you've ever caused on fate?) Wright Anything Agency, Reception Hall, or Foyer Talk Any ideas? Phoenix: The internal affairs of a powerful and wealthy family... I get the feeling this is going to get messy. What are your thoughts, Maya? Maya: Hmm... Prestigious families like this tend to try and protect their reputation, don't they? Phoenix: Yeah. That's the thing. Maya: But at least YOU don't have much of a reputation to protect. That means you can do anything you want to win this case! Phoenix: Who says I don't have a reputation to protect?! What to do Phoenix: I still can't help but wonder... You know this time travel thing Ellen keeps talking about... Do you think it really happened? Maya: Oh, I believe it happened! Phoenix: Y-You do?! Based on what? Maya: Well, it's not really based on anything, exactly... It's just that it's so much more fun to believe that it really happened! As soon as this case is over, I'm going to go talk with Sorin Sprocket myself. I'm going to ask him to send me back to medieval times! Phoenix: W-Well, I guess it's nice to have a dream... (Just please don't let the fantasy of time travel turn real in this case...) Present Larry's Drawing Maya: Larry's a really good artist, isn't he? No wonder he's a famous picture book author! Phoenix: Well, he's really good at something all right. Namely, at causing trouble wherever he goes. Maya: But he's also helped you out of a bind or two before, right? Phoenix: I guess so... (But that's not usually until after he's made a mess of things first...) After clearing \"What you saw on the airship\" Talk option in Sprocket Park - Mooring Dock: September 21Detention Center - Visitor's Room Ellen: No! Why?! ???: Please understand that this is in Master Sorin's best interest. Phoenix: (Sounds like Ellen's busy talking with someone...) Nichody: The next president cannot be married to a criminal. It would disgrace Sprocket Aviation. Miss Ellen, I need you to forget about this marriage. Phoenix: Pardon us... Nichody: ! ...If it isn't Mr. Wright. Phoenix: So... their marriage is definitely off? Nichody: There is no other choice. We cannot have a criminal in the family. For the sake of Master Sorin and the Sprocket family, this is what is best. Ellen: *sniffle* Nooooo... Maya: ... Um... in that case... ...what if Nick here proved Ellen's innocence? Then you wouldn't have a criminal in the family, right?! Nichody: ! ......I-I suppose you are right, but I am afraid that will be impossible. Maya: That's not true! Not for Nick. He may look like a nobody, but he can do some pretty amazing things! Phoenix: ......I don't take cases on lightly, so rest assured, I will prove her innocence. Nichody: Mr. Phoenix Wright... I understand your name is quite well-known in the judicial world... For better or for worse. Phoenix: ...Pierce, I want you to promise me this: If I can prove Ellen's innocence... ...then you won't stand in the way of Sorin and Ellen's marriage. Nichody: ......Hmph. Very well. But not even the most talented lawyer in the world can change reality itself. And the reality is, Miss Ellen is guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt. Phoenix: I believe that's where you're wrong, Pierce. Ellen: I'm clean! I swear I am! Obsessively, compulsively, clean! Just as clean and pure as this pure-white dress! Nichody: ...Fine. You have my word. But you will be the one to regret this promise. ......Now, if you will excuse me. Phoenix: (...Now I have all the more reason to win this case.) Ellen, we finished our investigation, and we'd like to talk with you about what we found. Ellen: Okay! So what did you find out? Talk Investigation results Phoenix: In the course of our investigation, we heard that... ...you had been standing in front of the victim with the murder weapon in your hands. Ellen: ! I-It wasn't what it looked like! It's true I was holding the murder weapon... ...but when I found him, he was already dead. I-I panicked... ...and I was hoping I could go back in time again, like I had done earlier. So I picked up the Time Keeper from the pedestal and brought it over without thinking. Phoenix: You were so desperate, you were ready to try anything, huh... Unfortunately, that sort of behavior makes you an easy target for the prosecution. Ellen: No... Phoenix: And as for your little trip through time... ...none of your in-laws could confirm your story, I'm afraid. Ellen: I... I see... Phoenix: The only exception is Larry. He said he saw something. Ellen: Really? Wh-What did he see? Time travel (appears after \"Investigation results\") Leads to: \"Can't say I quite believe it myself, but Larry claims he saw something incredible.\" Present Ellen's Pendant, Flying Chapel Pamphlet, Broken Lantern, Time Keeper, or Photo of Reception Ellen: Ooooooh... Phoenix: Wh-What's wrong? Ellen: I just remembered our reception... We were supposed to be so happy together! Oh, where did it all go wrong...? Phoenix: (I can't blame her for being upset.) Ellen: Why did this have to happen to me? UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Phoenix: E-Ellen! Please try to calm down! Okay?! Ellen: A-All right... Phoenix: (Well, she stopped crying, but... ...how can I ask her about anything when she's still so clearly distraught?) Photo of Victim Ellen: *gulp* Phoenix: A-Are you all right? Ellen: I-I... don't feel very well... Maya: Nick! That photo is a bit much for most normal people, you know! Phoenix: Y-Yeah, I guess you're right. (Oops, that was pretty inconsiderate of me...) Gloomsbury's Note Phoenix: Ellen, can you tell if this is Mr. Gloomsbury's handwriting? Ellen: No. I'm sorry. I'm not very familiar with his handwriting. Phoenix: I see... (And unless the handwriting is very distinct, I know it's often hard to tell.) Ellen: I-I'm sorry, but I'm not very comfortable with looking at a note which details... ...a plan on how to murder me written on it... Phoenix: Oh, sorry... I guess that should go without saying... Selena Sprocket Photo Ellen: *sniffle* Oh, poor Selena... I feel so sad about what happened to her...! SELENAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! Phoenix: Yikes! Ellen, please try to calm down! Pretty please? With sugar on top? Ellen: Sorin and I were supposed to be happy -- for Selena's sake, too. WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Maya: We... should probably leave this topic alone, Nick... Phoenix: Can't say I quite believe it myself, but Larry claims he saw something incredible. He claims he saw a pterodactyl flying outside the airship. Ellen: Wh... WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Phoenix: Not only that, but apparently Pierce Nichody told Larry to keep quiet about it. Ellen: But why would Pierce do such a thing? Maya: Larry's theory is that Sprocket Aviation is developing something in secret. A time machine, to be exact. Ellen: Do you think... Do you think that's why nobody would confirm my story? Because it's a secret? Phoenix: I-I really don't know. But speaking of your in-laws... ...we did manage to find your key card at Sprocket Manor. One of your in-laws said he'd keep an eye on it for you. Ellen: Oh, thank goodness! I lost it while I was getting things ready for the reception. I'd looked everywhere for it! I'm so glad you found iiiiiit! Phoenix: (A-At least they're tears of joy this time, for a change...) Maya: Well, Nick... It looks like you'll have to prove the existence of time travel in court tomorrow! Ellen: That's right! I swear that while Mr. Gloomsbury was being killed... ...I was busy traveling back through time! Phoenix: Great. With stodgy, skeptic Edgeworth at the helm for the prosecution tomorrow... ...we're really gonna have our work cut out for us. *sigh* To be continued Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: Nothing particularly interesting here. Area already examined Phoenix: (We've already searched here, but it never hurts to take another look around.) Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I think I'd better take a step back and gather my thoughts a little more...) Turnabout Time Traveler Image Gallery Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 September 22, 8:45 AMDistrict Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Ellen: Good morning, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Good morning, Ellen. I see you're still wearing your wedding gown. Ellen: And I will continue to wear it until our marriage is saved! ......... Oh! S-Sorin! Sorin: ............. Maya: Do you think he came to see how she's holding up? Ellen: Sorin, my love! You came all the way to the courthouse just to see me? Oh, Sorin! I don't know what to say! Sorin: ......Blueprints. Ellen: Huh? Sorin: The engine blueprints... I can't find them. Do you know where they are? Ellen: Oh! They're in your room, third shelf from the bottom, on the right-hand side. Sorin: ......Ah. I see. Phoenix: He's leaving already...? Maya: Don't tell me he came just to ask about some stupid blueprints? Is he really that cold of a person, or is that just how he comes off, I wonder... Ellen: *sniffle* Wh-What about me, Sorin...? Sorin: ......Ellen. Phoenix: (He's back.) Sorin: ............ ...Come home soon. ......I'm... lost without you. Ellen: ............S-S-S-Soriiiiiiiiiiiiin! Sorin: Later... Maya: Looks like showing your vulnerabilities is the fastest way to capturing a woman's heart. You should take notes on this, Nick. Phoenix: Please leave me out of this. (Anyway, it looks like Sorin isn't big on words... ...but it's clear that he cares about Ellen. Knowing that, I actually feel kind of relieved.) Ellen: Mr. Wright! I just absolutely CAN'T be found guilty, you hear! Phoenix: Don't worry. I'm going to do everything I can to prove your innocence. Ellen: THANK you, Mr. Wright! Bailiff: The trial is about to start, sir. Phoenix: (.........Edgeworth. Knowing him, he's not going to yield an inch. So I've just got to fight with everything I've got and save Ellen!) September 22, 9:00 AMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 6 Day 1Court Is Now In SessionAll Rise Judge: Court is now in session for the trial of Ellen Wyatt. Phoenix: The defense is ready, Your Honor. Edgeworth: The prosecution has been ready for a while, Your Honor. Judge: Seeing so many familiar faces gathered together like this... I feel as though I'm at a grand reunion. It makes me want to go out for dinner and a drink, and reminisce with all of you. Maya: Oh! That sounds like a great idea! I was dying for a real burger the whole time I was away! Phoenix: We could make it a welcome back party for Maya. How about it, Edgeworth? Edgeworth: .........I have no intention of cavorting with my enemies. Now then, Your Honor, let us start this trial at once. Judge: Ho ho. Still not one for lighthearted banter, are you, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Hmph. Jokes and good humor are beyond worthless in a court of law. Maya: Guess we'll just have to have the party without him, then. Edgeworth: ............ However, were it after the conclusion of this trial... ...I might consider joining you for your little welcome back party. I certainly wouldn't mind an invite, at the very least. Maya: ...He's still as emotionally constipated as ever, I see. Judge: Now then, Mr. Edgeworth, if you could please go over the details of this case for us. Edgeworth: The victim was Dumas Gloomsbury, a servant in the Sprocket household. He was in attendance at the wedding reception that occurred from 7 PM to 10 PM. Mr. Gloomsbury apparently felt some animosity toward Ellen Wyatt, and so... ...a bit after the reception ended at 10 PM, he assaulted Ms. Wyatt with the intent to kill her. The defendant fought back, and ended up killing Mr. Gloomsbury. Judge: Hmm... In other words... it was justified self-defense, correct? If that's the case, then the defendant might not be criminally responsible. Phoenix: (He's right... Worst-case scenario, I could go for self-defense to avoid the criminal charge. I wonder how Edgeworth plans to counter that, though...?) Edgeworth: ...The prosecution's first witness will make my view on the matter clear, Your Honor. Judge: Very well. Bailiff, please bring in the first witness. Edgeworth: Please state your name and occupation, witness. Ema: Ema Skye. Forensic investigator. A-And I'd just like to say, sir...! That being in the same courtroom as you is a great honor! Edgeworth: ......Hm? Phoenix: Oh, that's right... You're a fan of Edgeworth's, aren't you, Ema? Ema: We're good friends and all, Mr. Wright... ...but, just this once, I intend to faithfully and fully testify for the prosecution! And I do mean that wholeheartedly! Edgeworth: Heh. I expect no less from you. Ema: Yes, sir! I'm going to do my very best! Maya: Looks like you lost the popularity contest to Mr. Edgeworth, Nick. Phoenix: ...Meh, I really could care less. Besides... ...she'll see who's the better lawyer once I win this trial. Maya: Yeah... Maybe then you'll actually really care less. Judge: Now, Detective Skye, if you please. Witness Testimony -- Rundown of the Case -- Ema: The murder weapon was a clock called the \"Time Keeper.\" The victim was hit with it from behind, and he fell over, right into the lantern. The defendant was spotted then, standing in front of the body holding the murder weapon. The victim was struck twice, by the way. Phoenix: He was struck twice? Ema: That's right. There's no mistake about it. The first blow was to the back of the victim's head. It was hard enough to knock him unconscious. Yet, despite the fact that he had been immobilized by the first blow... ...the defendant delivered a second, fatal blow to the side of the victim's head. Phoenix: ...Which means... what, exactly? Edgeworth: Hmph. I figured it would go right over your head. Let's put it this way: By striking the victim a second time... ...the defendant killed her last chance to escape from any criminal wrongdoing. Judge: She did? But how, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: The defendant may have been fighting back because she was being attacked. However... ...she then went on to deliver a fatal blow to a man who was already fully unconscious. Maya: N-Nick, is he saying what I think he is...? Phoenix: I don't feel so well... Edgeworth: And thus, Mr. Wright, has justified self-defense been removed from the table. The prosecution intends to prove that the defendant killed the victim... ...with murderous intent. Allow me to, belatedly, submit the victim's autopsy report. Phoenix: ......A... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRNNGH! (So THAT'S why he was acting all smug...! Well, more smug than usual...) Maya: I-It's fine, right? It's not like we were going to plead self-defense anyway, right? Phoenix: Right, but... now the judge has a negative impression of Ellen. Judge: ............ Edgeworth: Hmph. Phoenix: (He may not get to prosecute much anymore, but he definitely hasn't lost his touch.) Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Judge: Now, then, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination. Cross Examination -- Rundown of the Case -- Ema: The murder weapon was a clock called the \"Time Keeper.\" Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you completely sure the murder weapon was the Time Keeper? Ema: Yes, completely. The shape of the injury on the victim's head matches up with that of the Time Keeper. And it's definitely heavy enough to kill someone with. Phoenix: But would the defendant have been able to pick up and swing something so heavy? Ema: I tried it myself, and I was able to lift it up just fine. Phoenix: Maybe you're just freakishly strong...? Ema: Excuse me, Mr. Wright?! I'll have you know that people on the force know me as the dainty forensic investigator! Phoenix: S-Sorry... (...But really, you're hardly a delicate flower.) Edgeworth: ...Mr. Wright. This is a court of law. Save your antics for after the trial, if you know how. Phoenix: Yes, sir... It won't happen again, sir... Ema: Hmph! ...Moving on! Ema: The victim was hit with it from behind, and he fell over, right into the lantern. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The defendant was fighting back against the victim, right? If so, wouldn't she have hit him from the front and not from behind? Ema: The victim must've tried to run once Ms. Wyatt started fighting back. That's probably when he got hit from behind. Phoenix: I see... Thus, the blow to the back of his head. Ema: The defendant must've looked awfully scary when she was brandishing that clock. Phoenix: I don't know about that... (Regardless of how scary Ellen looked, the victim was definitely hit from behind...) Ema: ...May I go on? Phoenix: Yes, of course. Please do. Present Photo of Victim Phoenix: Leads to: \"Detective Skye, I'm afraid I have to apologize in advance.\" Ema: The defendant was spotted then, standing in front of the body holding the murder weapon. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: B-But that's only because she was so panicked when she found the body... ...that she tried to use the Time Keeper to go back in time. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Mr. Wright... Do you have any idea how absurd you sound? Phoenix: B-But Ms. Wyatt really believed she could travel through time with that clock! Edgeworth: You really should've come up with a more credible story, you know. Judge: Yes, I agree. Phoenix: (Me, three... But it's all I have to go on...) Ema: ...Anyway, under the circumstances... ...the only conclusion we can draw is that the defendant killed the victim. Ema: The victim was struck twice, by the way. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Ms. Wyatt must've had a chance to escape after she struck the victim the first time. So why would she stick around and hit him with such a heavy object again? Ema: Well, about that... Edgeworth: Allow me to explain. Why did she strike him again, indeed? To finish off the victim, of course. This very act clearly shows that she had every intention of killing Mr. Gloomsbury! Phoenix: Urk! Maya: But Ms. Wyatt would never do a thing like that! Edgeworth: Then let's see some evidence that disproves my theory! Maya: Nnrrgh...! Are you going to just stand there and take that from him, Nick?! Phoenix: (I can't refute his claim head-on, so I'll have to approach it from a different angle.) Phoenix: Well... ...it looks like we won't be going anywhere until we can refute Edgeworth's claim. Maya: This is so exciting! We haven't taken on Mr. Edgeworth in ages! Phoenix: Y-Yeah... Maya: Okay, Nick! Now, go get him! Phoenix: No need to rush me, Maya... (All right. I'd better start by comparing Ema's testimony with the evidence we have... ...and look for any glaring inconsistencies!) Phoenix: Detective Skye, I'm afraid I have to apologize in advance. Ema: For what? Phoenix: For embarrassing you in front of your idol. Ema: Wh-What do you mean? Phoenix: If you take a look at this photo of the crime scene... ...you'll see that the victim is lying on his back. But if the victim had been hit from behind as you claim... ...then he should have fallen over into the lantern facedown. Ema: Aaaaah! Phoenix: It's not enough to simply take someone's side, Detective Skye. Even if it's Mr. Edgeworth's. Ema: Ah...! Oooh... Judge: Hmm... There does appear to be a flaw in Detective Skye's testimony. Ema: Ema: Mr. Wright! If you think I'm going to just back right down, then you're sadly mistaken! Phoenix: (Ema is unusually fired up today...) Maya: Don't forget, she's in front of her hero, Nick. If the Steel Samurai came to watch this trial, I'd want to do my absolute best, too. Ema: Listen, Mr. Wright. It's entirely possible that the defendant moved the victim's body after he fell over. In that case, there wouldn't be any contradiction, right? Edgeworth: Indeed. That was an excellent counterargument, Detective. Ema: You can count on me, sir! So, what do you have to say to that, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Is it possible that the victim's body was moved after he fell into the lantern? It's possible Phoenix: The defense believes... it's possible that the victim's body was moved by the defendant! Maya: Wh-What are you doing, Nick?! You're backing up Ema's claim?! Phoenix: ......Oops! I meant to answer in the negative! Judge: In other words, you wish to claim the exact opposite of what you just said? A reversal that dramatic... ...deserves an equally dramatic punishment. Phoenix: There's no need to be such a drama queen about it, Your Honor... (Well, I guess this leaves me with just one answer. I can't mess this up now!) Leads back to: \"Is it possible that the victim's body was moved after he fell into the lantern?\" It's not possible Leads to: \"Sorry, Detective, but there's no way the victim's body was moved after his death.\" Phoenix: Sorry, Detective, but there's no way the victim's body was moved after his death. Ema: Oh, really? And what makes you so sure? Phoenix: One look at this here, and it should become obvious. Present rubble on top of body Phoenix: Leads to: \"Th-Those broken bits of the lantern?\" Present anywhere else Phoenix: Ema: Um... What exactly are you pointing at, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Oh... uh... This right here? Judge: Hmm... What you're trying to communicate is not obvious at all, Mr. Wright. But this penalty should make my feelings on the matter pretty obvious -- even to you. Phoenix: (The only thing that's obvious right now is the pain in my attorney's badge.) Leads back to: \"One look at this here, and it should become obvious.\" Ema: Th-Those broken bits of the lantern? Phoenix: Yes. If the body had been moved after the fact, these fragments would've fallen off of it. But, as you can clearly see, they're lying perfectly undisturbed on top of the body. This means that the victim must've been lying face up from before the lantern even broke. Ema: .......You're right! Maya: But wait a minute. If that's true... ...then when was the victim killed? I mean, the lantern was still whole during the reception, right? Phoenix: Right. Which means we've just overturned a major assumption about this case. If the victim was already dead before the lantern was even broken... ...then the body must've been inside the lantern since before the reception started. In other words... ...the defense asserts that the victim was killed before the wedding reception! Judge: WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Phoenix: In short... ...when Ms. Wyatt was seen standing in front of the body after the reception... ...it wasn't the moment just after the murder was committed. It was the moment she happened to discover the body -- just as Ms. Wyatt claims! Ema: AAAAAAAAAAH! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hmph. Whether the act was committed before or after the reception is entirely inconsequential. After all, it was the defendant who prepared the reception hall for the event in question. Therefore, when the murder occurred changes nothing with regard to her guilt. She could have killed the victim before the reception, as you claim... ...and then tried to hide his body in the lantern after the event ended! Phoenix: Phoenix: Sorry, but that doesn't make any sense. I mean, where would the body have been hidden during the reception in your scenario? Edgeworth: Urngh... Th-That's...! Phoenix: Even you have to admit, Mr. Edgeworth, that this has opened up a new possibility. Edgeworth: Do explain, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Well, if Ms. Wyatt didn't commit the crime in the reception hall... ...then that means someone, somewhere put the victim's body into the lantern. Judge: Hmm... I suppose that makes sense. A dead body couldn't have put itself in there. Phoenix: Exactly, Your Honor. In other words... If the murder actually occurred before the reception, it opens up the possibility that... He was killed somewhere else Leads to: \"If the body was hidden inside the lantern...\" The defendant didn't do it Phoenix: The defendant didn't commit this murder! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Oh, for heaven's sake. Even if the murder was committed before the reception... ...that alone doesn't erase the suspicion against the defendant! Judge: It seems that was too ridiculous of a leap backwards for Mr. Edgeworth, Mr. Wright. I suggest you look before you leap, and think before you speak. Phoenix: (I guess I got ahead of myself on that one...) Leads back to: \"If the murder actually occurred before the reception, it opens up the possibility that...\" He was killed some other way Phoenix: The victim was killed some other way! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What does the victim's time of death have anything to do with how he was killed? I suggest you read the autopsy report again, Mr. Wright. Especially the part that states that the victim was clubbed to death with the Time Keeper! Phoenix: It was worth a try... Judge: You should know better than to just say the first shocking thing that comes to mind. Phoenix: (I've got this. I just have to stay cool and answer rationally.) Leads back to: \"If the murder actually occurred before the reception, it opens up the possibility that...\" Phoenix: If the body was hidden inside the lantern... ...then, it's possible that the body was moved along with it from somewhere else. Maya: Oh! You're right! Edgeworth: You can run that mouth of yours all you want... ...but do you have any evidence to support what's coming out of it, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Of course I do. (I think the answer lies in that piece of evidence -- and in something... ...that was left at the crime scene that will point us to where the victim was really killed!) Judge: Very well, Mr. Wright. In that case... What proves that the lantern and the body were moved from somewhere else? Present Photo of Victim Phoenix: Leads to: \"The photo of the victim again...?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This proves that the murder took place somewhere other than the reception hall! Judge: Hmm... I'm afraid I can't say that I follow. Maya: That piece of evidence won't help you make your point, Nick! Judge: Yet another pointless piece of evidence from a senseless attorney. Phoenix: (Fine, so this piece wasn't convincing enough. Then there must be something else that would be easier for the judge to understand!) Leads back to: \"What proves that the lantern and the body were moved from somewhere else?\" Ema: The photo of the victim again...? Phoenix: Yes. I'd like the court to focus on this thing, right here! Present flower petals Phoenix: Leads to: \"Flower petals, Mr. Wright?\" Present anywhere else Phoenix: Judge: Hmm... I'm afraid I don't get it at all. What exactly are we looking at here, Mr. Wright? Edgeworth: Hmph. That far-off look in his eyes suggests that his mind is equally as far-off in La-La Land. Judge: The defense will focus on the trial, if that's not too much to ask. Phoenix: (Well, that brought me back to reality fast.) Leads back to: \"I'd like the court to focus on this thing, right here!\" Ema: Flower petals, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: These petals are from a kind of flower that were not present in the reception hall. This means they must've gotten into the lantern when it was somewhere else. Edgeworth: And just where do you propose this \"somewhere else\" to be, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: I propose that this piece of evidence will tell us where the flower petals came from. Present Photo of Hold Phoenix: Leads to: \"Please take a look at the flowers in this picture of the hold.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: One look at this, and you'll see exactly where the petals came from! Judge: ............ Are you sure about that, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: I am, Your Honor! Judge: Because I'm afraid I can't see how. Phoenix: Even if you take a really good look? Judge: Unfortunately not. Phoenix: What if you... smelled the evidence? Judge: Still nothing. Phoenix: Huh. That's odd. Aha ha ha ha... Judge: This is no laughing matter, defense! I hope this will teach you to take matters seriously! Edgeworth: I suggest you refrain from embarrassing yourself any further with such stale jokes. Phoenix: I'll make sure to whip up a fresh batch for next time, then... A-All joking aside... (Even though I was actually being serious...) Leads back to: \"I propose that this piece of evidence will tell us where the flower petals came from.\" Phoenix: Please take a look at the flowers in this picture of the hold. Notice how their petals are of the same shape as the petals in the crime scene photo? Judge: Hmm, yes. I see. They do look to be from the same kind of flower. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hmph. Is that really all you've got? A flower is a flower is a flower. They're all the same. I would hardly call what you presented \"compelling evidence.\" Judge: I'm afraid I couldn't disagree with you more, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Hm? Judge: I gave a flower of this type to my lovely wife once when we were young. So I can assure you that this is very meaningful and compelling evidence indeed. The soundness of my judgment in this matter is backed by nothing less than pure love! Edgeworth: B-But, Your Honor... Phoenix: Let it go, Mr. Edgeworth. It's clear you don't know much about flowers. It's not like you have anyone you'd actually give any to, after all. But maybe you should study up on them, just in case the opportunity presents itself. Edgeworth: Nngoooh! This is from the man who only knows the names of three types of flowers! Phoenix: Th-That's hardly relevant to the case at hand! The defense asserts that it's highly probable that the victim was killed in the hold! If the body was then placed in the lantern and moved to the reception hall for some reason... ...it would completely destroy the prosecution's case! Maya: Then you mean, the body was...? Phoenix: Yes. The victim's body was... ...inside the lantern during the entire beautiful wedding reception! While the defendant and her betrothed were celebrating their love! Judge: WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hmph. Your smooth talk might work on His Honor, but it won't work on me. Phoenix: What are you talking about now? Edgeworth: Take another look at all of the evidence and you'll soon see what I mean. Phoenix: ............ (I wish he would just tell me already...) Edgeworth: Detective Skye, I'm sure you've already figured out what I'm talking about, correct? Ema: Heh heh heh. Of course, sir! Mr. Wright is the only one here who hasn't. Why don't you leave this to me, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Very well. Let's see what you can do. Judge: Detective Skye, please give your testimony to this court. Witness Testimony -- The Prosecution's Rebuttal -- Ema: The victim could not have been killed before the reception. The autopsy report states that the estimated time of death was after the reception. And that estimated time of death is correct. There's no way it could be wrong. Ema: It's clear Mr. Gloomsbury was killed after the reception. And that completely contradicts your claim! Phoenix: Hmm......... I guess so. Edgeworth: Tell me you took at least a cursory glance at the autopsy report, Mr. Wright. It appears you've grown rusty since our last outing. Might I suggest you go back and brush up on the basics? Phoenix: ......Sure. Though I must say, you're as cocky as ever, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: I beg your pardon? Ema: Wh-What are you trying to say, Mr. Wright?! Phoenix: I'm just saying that I'll go back to basics, if that's what Mr. Edgeworth wants. I'll prove how badly he's underestimating me with a good old-fashioned cross-examination. Edgeworth: ............... Judge: Very well. Let's see you put your money where your mouth is, Mr. Wright. Cross Examination -- The Prosecution's Rebuttal -- Ema: The victim could not have been killed before the reception. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You sound pretty certain. You must have some solid grounds for making that claim, right? Ema: Of course I do. And you're gonna feel silly when I show you what they are. Ready? Feast your eyes on this! Ema: The autopsy report states that the estimated time of death was after the reception. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: I've read the autopsy report, too, you know. Ema: Then you don't need me to explain it to you, right? How there's no way the victim could've been killed before the reception, I mean. Phoenix: Detective Skye... ...I think you've overlooked something big. Ema: I have?! Phoenix: Why don't you take another look at the evidence? Ema: ...But I've already looked at all the evidence! And quite carefully, too, I'll have you know! Edgeworth: Detective Skye. Do not be taken in by his verbal antics. He is simply bluffing, as always. Ema: R-Right, sir! Ema: And that estimated time of death is correct. There's no way it could be wrong. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Is it possible that the culprit did something to obscure the real time of death? Ema: No, not in this case. There was no snow or anything to keep the body from decomposing. And there's no fridge on that airship big enough to fit a body into. Phoenix: So you've already checked into that, I see... Maya: It all comes down to the estimated time of death, doesn't it? Couldn't the killer mess with the victim's time of death by keeping the body on ice? Phoenix: Yeah, if they had the means to. Present Fog Machine Phoenix: Leads to: \"I admit that the estimated time of death does contradict my theory.\" Phoenix: The prosecution is treating the estimated time of death as an absolute. But is it really? Maya: I take it you don't think it is, huh, Nick? In that case, we're going to have to find a way to convince them otherwise! Phoenix: Yeah, there's gotta be a way somehow... Phoenix: I admit that the estimated time of death does contradict my theory. Ema: Finally! And that means your theory that the victim was killed before the reception... Phoenix: ...Is still entirely plausible! Ema: Huh? Wh-What makes you think that? Phoenix: The killer could've falsified the time of death by using a certain item in the reception hall. Please take a look at this. Judge: And what is that contraption, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: It's a fog machine, Your Honor, used to create a special, romantic atmosphere in the hall. Judge: And this machine could have been used to falsify the time of death? Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor, because this machine uses dry ice to perform its magic. Judge: Dry ice? Ah yes -- the super cold stuff commonly used to make theatrical fog, right? I see. So your claim is that this dry ice was used to keep the body cold? Ema: ......Oh...! In that case, I guess the victim COULD have been killed before the reception... Judge: Order! Order in this court! Well, Mr. Edgeworth? What do you have to say about this development? Edgeworth: ......That the victim was killed in the hold before the wedding reception? .....The prosecution acknowledges the possibility of this claim. Phoenix: (Now we're getting somewhere!) Edgeworth: ...The prosecution would also like to thank you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Huh? For what? Edgeworth: I didn't know how a certain piece of evidence fit into this case... But now, thanks to you, I do. Phoenix: What piece of evidence? Edgeworth: To get into the hold, one needs a key card, like this one. And, here, we have a record of those who entered the hold with such key cards. The times aren't specified, but these are the last three entries on the day of the murder. And as you can see, the last person to enter the hold that day... was the defendant. Phoenix: Wh-What?! Judge: So the one who moved the body out of the hold must have been...? Edgeworth: That's right. It was none other than the defendant. Hold Entry Record added to the Court Record. Maya: Hey, Nick, take a look at this entry record. There are a couple of other names on here besides Ellen's. Phoenix: Hey, you're right! According to the entry record, Mr. Edgeworth, Pierce Nichody had also gone into the hold. Isn't it possible that he could've been the culprit? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Sorry, but Mr. Nichody was escorting a few of the guests at the time. I'm sure they would be happy to testify to that fact, if you'd like. Think me cocky all you'd like, Mr. Wright, but my confidence is rarely misplaced. Phoenix: Arngh... Edgeworth: Now then, it's probably safe to assume that after killing the victim in the hold... ...the defendant moved his body to the hall in order to dispose of it discreetly. Phoenix: What do you mean by \"discreetly\"? Edgeworth: The defendant volunteered to take care of the reception's cleanup personally. That means she would've had the chance to dispose of anything in any way she wanted. Including taking the lantern off the airship without raising any suspicion. Don't tell me you didn't know about Ms. Wyatt volunteering for cleanup duty, Mr. Wright. Ellen: For my last task as a servant of the Sprocket household... ...I offered to take on the preparation and cleanup of the reception banquet. Phoenix: I-I see... Phoenix: Gaaah! Edgeworth: Look at you, sweating buckets like a rookie... even after all these years. Nevertheless... Thank you for proving that the only person who could've killed the victim in the hold is... ...Ellen Wyatt! Phoenix: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! (Great job, Phoenix. Now we're back to square one!) Edgeworth: Heh. Perhaps you should ask Ms. Cykes for some help in reviewing Defense for Dummies. Ema: Way to go, sir! You've got Mr. Wright in a cold sweat! Edgeworth: Hmph. I wonder if maybe the promise of seeing that miserable look on his face... ...is what brought me back to court today. It's certainly made all of my stress and woes as chief prosecutor just melt away. Maya: I guess he had a lot of stress built up. Phoenix: I'll give him something to stress over before we're through today! Edgeworth: Your Honor, the prosecution asks that you render your verdict at this time. Before that man over there tries to throw the court into chaos with his meaningless bluffs. Judge: ...Hmm, I see. Mr. Wright... ...are there any last meaningful bluffs you'd like to present to this court? Phoenix: Uh... (Why does he have to assume it'll be a bluff?) Maya: N-Nick! Hurry up and throw a good one out there! Phoenix: I will! I will! ........... Well, all right, then. Let's see... I-I've got it! How do you know it was Ms. Wyatt who used her key card? After all, if it turns out that somebody else used her card... ...it would mean Ms. Wyatt didn't do it! Judge: Interesting. And are you able to prove this bluff to be true? Phoenix: I-I assure you, I'm not bluffing, Your Honor. (Well, now what...?) Maya: Wait a minute, Nick. I can think of a certain somebody who might've used Ellen's key card. Phoenix: You can? Maya: Remember? The one who was sneaking around the hold, in spite of not being a family member...? Phoenix: Oh, that's right! Your Honor! The defense would like to call a certain witness to the stand! I need the testimony of this person, who may have entered the hold with Ms. Wyatt's card! Present Larry Butz profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Th-That's your witness?!\" Present anyone else Phoenix: Phoenix: This person used Ms. Wyatt's key card to enter the hold! Edgeworth: What are you talking about, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Wait, did I make a mistake...? Edgeworth: You would know if you had been paying any attention to our arguments up to this point. Phoenix: ...Ahem. So... So that means... Judge: Exactly. It means you get a penalty. Phoenix: I was afraid of that. Edgeworth: I'd advise you to take this a little more seriously, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: And I will! Your Honor! The defense would like to call a certain witness to the stand! Leads back to: \"I need the testimony of this person, who may have entered the hold with Ms. Wyatt's card!\" Edgeworth: Th-That's your witness?! A-Are you saying that THAT numbskull was on the airship? He never breathed a word about that to me! Phoenix: That's not surprising, because Mr. Nichody told him to keep quiet about it. But Mr. Butz himself admitted it to me. He claimed to have found a way to sneak into the Flying Chapel's hold to see Ms. Wyatt. This photo he took and gave to me is proof. Edgeworth: Th-Then was it he who moved the lantern with the body inside to the reception hall? Phoenix: You know as well as I that with him, anything is possible. And this is one possibility we should definitely look into. Edgeworth: .....I-I can't believe this. What in the world is HE doing mixed up in this? Phoenix: Come on, Mr. Edgeworth. Remember what we've been saying since elementary school? Edgeworth: .....\"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\" Phoenix: Exactly. Edgeworth: Gaaaaaagh! That Larry! He'll pay for this! Phoenix: Well, if you want to extract your payment now... ...he's right up there in the gallery! Larry: Yikes! Judge: Bailiff! Seize the witness before he makes a run for it! Larry: Noooooooooooooooooo! Why does this stuff always happen to MEEEEEEEEEE?! Phoenix: (Sorry, Larry... but you brought this on yourself.) Judge: Let us break for a fifteen minute recess. I ask that both sides prepare for the next witness's testimony during this time. September 22District Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Maya: Wow. It's been a while since I've had this much fun and excitement! A face-off against Mr. Edgeworth! A harrowing tightrope walk for the defense! Phoenix: Whew! I'm exhausted already. ???: Boss! Athena: I'm here for moral support! Phoenix: Athena! Are you all done practicing for Trucy's magic show? Athena: Well... to be perfectly honest... I sorta ran away. But that's because she was putting my life in danger, I tell you! Phoenix: I see... I think I'll need to have a one-on-one with her... You're really athletic and fit, Athena, so Trucy probably thinks she can run you ragged. Athena: That may be true... ...which is why not even Trucy can keep up with me when I run at full speed! ???: Hah! Looks like you spoke too soon, Athena! Never underestimate the resourcefulness of a great magician! Athena: Huh? Trucy: Magical Girl Trucy Wright... is on the scene! Athena: N-Nooooooooooooooooooo! Trucy: Now, Athena! It's time to practice human combustion magic! Go on, douse yourself in this gasoline! But don't worry! It's a magic trick, after all, so it's perfectly safe! Athena: ......R... R...

Bailiff: Court will soon be back in session, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Right, thank you! Maya: So Larry's the next witness, right? I can't wait to see what happens! Phoenix: Sadly, I can already imagine it... September 22District Court - Courtroom No. 6 Judge: Court will now reconvene. Larry: ......Nick! Edgey! The two of you are gonna hang me out to dry, aren't you?! Edgeworth: No, not the both of us. Just Mr. Wright. Larry: N-Nick... How could you...? Phoenix: (I don't really think he did it, of course, but I've gotta use whatever leads I can...) Mr. Butz, there's a possibility you moved the lantern that had the dead body in it. So if you want to clear yourself of any suspicion, all you have to do is testify. Larry: ............ Judge: Now then, your testimony, please, witness.

Adds statement \"Anyone could tell there were two Pegabulls by looking at the Flying Chapel's pamphlet!\" Larry: Anyone could tell there were two Pegabulls by looking at the Flying Chapel's pamphlet! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Seriously, Larry. If you're hiding something, you'd better fess up now. Larry: I-I'm telling ya! I don't know nothin'! Why do you have to doubt me so much?! Phoenix: Why? Because you're you, that's why! Larry: Edgey...! You think Nick's being awful to me, don't you? So you tell him...! Tell Nick what a big meanie he is! Edgeworth: I would... if I thought he was being one. Larry: N-Not you, too! Why doesn't anybody ever take my side?! Phoenix: (I wish I didn't have to doubt him... But something about what he just said doesn't add up.) Present Flying Chapel Pamphlet Phoenix: Leads to: \"I want you to take a look at this, Mr. Butz.\" Before adding statement Phoenix: Well, I guess about all I can do... ...is try to get some kind of statement out of him somehow. Maya: Good luck. After adding statement Maya: You finally got a decent statement out of him, huh, Nick! Phoenix: Yeah, finally. (It sure took a lot of work, though... I hope all of this leads somewhere...) Phoenix: I want you to take a look at this, Mr. Butz. Because unfortunately for you, the pamphlet clearly shows... ...a Pegacow and a Pegabull in their example diagram of the reception hall. Larry: Huh?! Phoenix: But on that day, instead of putting a Pegacow and Pegabull out for the bride and groom... ...there were two male Pegabulls on display. Larry: Nnnnngh... Phoenix: Yet, somehow, you knew there were two Pegabulls in the reception hall that day. There's only one way you'd know something like that, Larry... It was YOU who moved the Pegabull to the reception hall, wasn't it?! Larry: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Edgeworth: N-No... Larry, y-you didn't...! Judge: Mr. Butz, did you move the lantern containing the victim's body to the reception hall? Larry: Th-That's what it looks like! Maya: Whaaaaat?! Phoenix: ............! Larry: Larry: W-Wait! Nick! Y-You don't think I'M the murderer, do ya?! Maya: Maybe you and Mr. Gloomsbury were fighting over Ms. Wyatt, and you ended up killing him? Larry: M-Mayaaaaa! Not you, tooooo! Look, I did sneak into the reception, but that's as far as it went. You know me! I wouldn't hurt a fly! Phoenix: Y-You \"snuck into the reception\"...? Larry: Yeah, sure. But some of the Sprocket men caught and locked me up in one of the cabins. It was pretty awful, actually! But that's when I made that drawing of the pterodactyl I showed you, Nick! Phoenix: (Ix-nay on the erodactyl-ptay, Larry...) Edgeworth: Mr. Wright, not even you would take this farce that far... would you? Phoenix: ............ (We ARE talking about Larry... What do I do? Do I accuse Larry of being the true culprit?) Accuse him Phoenix: (I guess I have no choice but to accuse him...! Wait a minute... But Larry didn't have any reason to kill Gloomsbury!) Leads to: \"No, you're right, Mr. Edgeworth.\" No, of course not Leads to: \"No, you're right, Mr. Edgeworth.\" Phoenix: No, you're right, Mr. Edgeworth. Mr. Butz didn't have a reason to kill Mr. Gloomsbury. He might've had an imaginary reason to kill Sorin Sprocket, sure, but not Mr. Gloomsbury. Maya: After all, he did steal Mr. Sprocket's bride and try to elope with her... Larry: Just 'cause I tried to steal somebody's bride doesn't make me a murderer! Phoenix: ......I believe you, Larry. And I don't think you killed anybody, either. You would never do anything like that. Larry: N-Nick, ol' buddy, ol' pal! I knew you'd come through for me! Phoenix: (Funny, that, considering your sworn testimony just now that we were through...) Judge: Mr. Butz, it's time you told this court the whole truth. Understood? Witness Testimony -- Moving the Lantern -- Larry: It's just like Nick said, I'm the one who moved the lantern. I was poking around the reception hall before the main event and saw a lantern was broken. There was a note on it that said, \"Exchange with the one in the hold. --Ellen.\" So I decided to do Elly a favor. Judge: So you switched the lanterns before the reception, did you? Then that means the victim really WAS killed before the reception. Broken Lantern updated in the Court Record. Edgeworth: It would appear... that Mr. Butz completely fell for the defendant's scheme. Larry: Scheme? What scheme? Edgeworth: This note from the defendant: \"Exchange with the one in the hold. --Ellen\"... Mr. Butz moved the lantern with the body in it up to the reception hall because of this note. And thus, he has become a suspect in Mr. Gloomsbury's murder. Larry: *gulp*... That second lantern did feel pretty heavy... ...but I never would've thought there was a dead body in it! Phoenix: (Arnngh... What was a note like that doing on a lantern in the first place...?!) Ellen: Ellen: You've got it all wrong, Mr. Edgeworth! I left that note for myself! It was simply a reminder because I can be very forgetful! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What a sorry excuse, Ms. Wyatt. The prosecution contends that this note shows one facet of the defendant's murderous plan. And you, Mr. Butz, you played right into Ms. Wyatt's hands. Larry: No way, Edgey! I don't believe it! Phoenix: Phoenix: Do you still really believe Ms. Wyatt to be the culprit, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Hmph. Of course. My stance on the matter remains unchanged. If you think I'm wrong, then prove it with your cross-examination. Phoenix: (Gladly!) Judge: Very well. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness. Cross Examination -- Moving the Lantern -- Larry: It's just like Nick said, I'm the one who moved the lantern. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why didn't you tell us that sooner?! Larry: Because I knew you guys were gonna be suspicious of me, that's why! Phoenix: We're suspicious of you now because you tried to hide it! Edgeworth: My thoughts exactly. Larry: Hmph! Well, now I've told you! Happy? So how about letting me go?! Phoenix: No, not yet. We need you to stick around to sort a few things out. Larry: Grrrrr! FINE! Larry: I was poking around the reception hall before the main event and saw a lantern was broken. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The lantern you swapped out was a female Pegamoo -- a Pegacow, right? Larry: Yeah, I guess. Phoenix: Why did you replace a female lantern with a male one? Larry: Because I was too busy trying not to get caught. I didn't have time to check for little details like that. Phoenix: If you didn't want to get caught, you could've just left well enough alone, you know. Larry: Whatever! Anyway, when I took a look at the broken lantern, I saw... Larry: There was a note on it that said, \"Exchange with the one in the hold. --Ellen.\" Press Phoenix: Phoenix: That note wasn't addressed to you, was it? Larry: Well, I guess not, but... ...how could I let my dear, sweet Elly do all that hard physical labor on her own?! Phoenix: (It's precisely that thought process that constantly gets you in trouble, Larry...) Larry: Besides, it was my big chance to show her how much I cared about her. Larry: So I decided to do Elly a favor. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Nobody saw you the whole time while you were switching the lanterns? Larry: Nope. I didn't get caught. Not that time, anyway. Phoenix: \"Not that time\"? Larry: Yeah. When I'd tried to sneak into the reception hall the first time... ...I didn't have as much luck. Those Sprocket guys spotted me and nabbed me. Phoenix: All of my words are failing me right now... Larry: Pretty exciting, don't ya think? Phoenix: (Larry... You need help.) Larry: And then they locked me up in one of the cabins. ......Nick, what are you asking about stuff like this for, anyway? Shouldn't you be trying to prove Elly's innocence?! Phoenix: (Well... Is that statement of his important to the case...?) It's important Phoenix: Mr. Butz trying to crash the reception, and subsequently getting locked up in a cabin... I believe these might be important facts in this case, Your Honor. Judge: Very well. Mr. Butz, please add that statement to your testimony. Adds statement \"I tried to sneak into the reception hall, but I got caught and locked up in a cabin.\" It's not important Phoenix: Given the lack of any important info... I guess I can let this line of questioning go for now. Leads back to cross-examination Press (after adding statement) Phoenix: Phoenix: Nobody saw you the whole time while you were switching the lanterns? Larry: Nope. I didn't get caught. Not that time, anyway. Phoenix: \"Not that time\"? Larry: Yeah. When I'd tried to sneak into the reception hall the first time... ...I didn't have as much luck. Those Sprocket guys spotted me and nabbed me. Phoenix: All of my words are failing me right now... Larry: Pretty exciting, don't ya think? Phoenix: (Larry... You need help.) Larry: And then they locked me up in one of the cabins. ......Nick, what are you asking about stuff like this for, anyway? Shouldn't you be trying to prove Elly's innocence?! Larry: I tried to sneak into the reception hall, but I got caught and locked up in a cabin. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you got locked up. Then what happened? Larry: I broke out. Then I started looking for Elly and wandered into the reception hall again. That's when I saw the broken lantern and replaced it. Phoenix: ......Even after they caught you and locked you up, you still went looking for Ms. Wyatt? ...But, hold on a minute... Maya: What is it, Nick? Phoenix: Maya, doesn't something seem weird to you? Larry is saying he replaced the lantern after he broke out of the cabin. Maya: That's right-- Oh, wait... Huh? You're right. It doesn't make much sense, does it? Judge: Mr. Wright, have you found an inconsistency in the witness's statement? Phoenix: Yes, I believe so, Your Honor. Mr. Butz moved the lantern after he broke out of the cabin, but that contradicts with this. Present Broken Lantern Phoenix: Leads to: \"Is that...?!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Judge: Hmm... And in what sense does that piece of evidence contradict with the statement? Larry: It doesn't contradict at all, does it! Edgeworth: Indeed. Phoenix: Urngh...! Oh, don't mind me, Your Honor. It looks like I just made a tiny mistake. That's all. Leads back to cross-examination Phoenix: Knowing Larry... ...he definitely did something stupid somewhere along the way. Maya: Wow. Larry sure is one special guy... Not everyone has the privilege of being THIS distrusted by their best friends... Phoenix: Assuming he can't be trusted from the get-go usually makes things easier, I've learned. Maya: Oh, I see! You totally trust him to be totally untrustworthy! Phoenix: Yeah, I guess that just about sums it up. Judge: Is that...?! Phoenix: Yes, it's the broken lantern, Your Honor. Mr. Butz, what you're saying doesn't make any sense at all. Larry: WHAT?! Why not?! Phoenix: You swapped the lanterns before the reception began, right? Larry: Yeah. That's what I said, isn't it? Phoenix: But you also just said that you swapped the lanterns... ...after you got locked up in a cabin for trying to sneak into the reception. In other words, you're saying you swapped the lanterns both before the reception... ...and after the reception took place. Judge: Hmm... That certainly doesn't make any sense, does it? Mr. Butz, did you swap the lanterns before or after the reception? Larry: Umm... Edgeworth: Which was it: before or after?! There's a world of difference between the two! Phoenix: Well, Mr. Butz? Larry: ......I guess I can't expect guys like you to understand. In a nutshell, it was both before... and after the reception. Phoenix: What? Larry: I tried to sneak into the first reception and got locked up. Phoenix: The \"first\" reception? (Uh-oh. I don't like where this is going...) Larry: Then, through the power of Elly's pendant... ...time got rewound, and we went back to the time before the reception. It was after that when I replaced the lantern. So it was both before the reception and after the reception. Get it? Phoenix: ............ Larry: We went back in time to before the reception. So, of course, the reception would take place one more time after that, right? That's why what I said makes perfect sense! Edgeworth: ......Mr. Wright, what in the world is the witness talking about? Has he developed some sort of intellectual ailment I'm not aware of since I saw him last? Phoenix: ...Um, well... Larry: None of the Sprockets seem to remember the time skip, but I do. And Elly remembers it, too! I think the power of our love for each other made that miracle happen! Judge: Mr. Wright. I'm sorry, but... ...could you please translate this man's gibberish so the rest of us can understand? Phoenix: (So now I have to be the one to explain about the whole time travel thing?!) Larry: Go on, Nick. I know you can do it! Maya: Looks like you don't have much choice, Nick! Phoenix: (To heck with it! I can't lose any more of my dignity today anyway!) ............ The defendant, Ms. Ellen Wyatt, has told the defense the following strange story. She said that after the reception ended, she was attacked by Mr. Gloomsbury. She claims that, as she was being assaulted, she made a wish upon her pendant. \"Please, take me back... back to that blissful moment...!\" In doing so... ...time apparently rewound itself to just before the reception began! Edgeworth: ......It what? Phoenix: I know it's hard to believe, but think about it this way. Through the power of the pendant, both Ellen Wyatt and Larry Butz... ...experienced time travel! Judge: Wh-Wh-Wh.... WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What absolute rubbish! Mr. Wright! I've heard my fair share of your nonsense over the years... ...but this takes the cake! Have you thoroughly lost your mind?! Phoenix: Phoenix: But this is simply the conclusion I came to... ...using that logic ability you love so much. Edgeworth: Wh-What? Phoenix: The truth of the matter is, the future president of Sprocket Aviation, Sorin Sprocket... ...has been researching time machines. So, what if a time machine has already been successfully created? And what if that's one of Sprocket Aviation's top secret inventions? Judge: A-A time machine?! Larry: Yeah! I even saw something while we were time traveling! I saw a pterodactyl flying through the sky! Maybe the airship was set to travel through time for their honeymoon trip? Judge: WHAAAAAAAAAT?! A-A pterodactyl?! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Y-You can't possibly have any evidence to back up your ridiculous time travel story...! Phoenix: Well... I, uh... Edgeworth: Hmph. As I thought. In any case, I now have the evidence to prove... ...that you're no more intelligent than Larry! Larry: Larry: Not so fast now, Edgey. I'm not the same ol' Larry you used to know. Edgeworth: .........Oh? Larry: You want evidence? I've got your evidence right here! This is a photo I secretly took of the first reception! Edgeworth: WHAT?! Phoenix: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! L-Larry! I can't believe you--! ......Well, anyway, good job! If we compare the photos of the first and second receptions and can find a difference... ...then we'll be able to prove that the reception was held twice! Judge: But do you really think such a difference exists? Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. I just need some time to find it for you. Edgeworth: This is preposterous! Judge: Very well. Please show the court what's different, then. Phoenix: This is proof positive that the wedding reception was held twice. Present Ellen Wyatt's bouquet Phoenix: Leads to: \"Please direct your attention to Ms. Wyatt's bouquet of flowers!\" Present anywhere else Phoenix: Phoenix: Here it is! This is proof that the reception was held twice! Judge: ...Where? Phoenix: Right here, Your Honor! Judge: ........... ......Right where? Phoenix: Um... Right... not here, maybe? Judge: It appears you've missed the mark, defense. I hope you take better aim next time before you fire off that mouth of yours! Phoenix: (But my aim is usually impeccable! I'd better take another good look at the two photos before I answer again, though!) Leads back to: \"This is proof positive that the wedding reception was held twice.\" Phoenix: Please direct your attention to Ms. Wyatt's bouquet of flowers! In the photo one of her in-laws took, the defendant is holding a yellow bouquet. But in the photo Mr. Butz took, she is holding a red bouquet! Maya: Y-You're right! Edgeworth: ......That's... impossible! Judge: Wh-What does this mean? Phoenix: It means that the defendant really did experience two wedding receptions! And she did that... when she traveled back through time! Judge: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Maya: N-Nick! You did it! You proved Ellen's time travel story to be true! Phoenix: Yeah... I can hardly believe it myself... (It's just as Ellen said -- the reception was held twice. This turns every assumption we've based this trial on upside down!) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ......I refuse to accept such a ludicrous argument! It is pure fiction under the guise of pseudoscience, at best! There is simply no such thing as time travel! Phoenix: I know it's hard, but can't you suspend your disbelief for one nanosecond, Edgeworth? Maya: I bet sci-fi movies push all your buttons the wrong way, don't they, Mr. Edgeworth...? I can totally picture you yelling, \"That'd never happen!\" every five seconds at the screen. Maybe you should stay away from movie dates altogether... Edgeworth: That's neither here nor there! This is real life we're talking about! Judge: But the proof is clearly shown in the two photographs. Phoenix: That's right, Mr. Edgeworth, no matter how inexplica-- Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Fine. I'll entertain your absurd delusion... ...if only to demolish it before your very eyes! Phoenix: What? Edgeworth: ......Let's start with this, then, shall we? There is one thing your time travel theory fails to explain. And that is the memories of the other guests there. The defendant and Larry remember the reception occurring twice... ...but no member of the Sprocket family has even mentioned such a thing. Phoenix: That's because the time machine is classified technolog-- Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I'm not done, you birdbrain! Phoenix: B-Birdbrain?! Edgeworth: As I was saying, if the entire family had been sworn to secrecy... ...then why hadn't they sworn the woman who was marrying into the family to secrecy, too? Phoenix: Th-That's a good point... Edgeworth: Honestly. All it takes is a little common sense, Mr. Wright. Judge: Hmm... Even still... ...how do we know that the trip through time did not really occur? There is proof in the photos that it did. And besides, if time travel doesn't exist, well... ...I'd be a little disappointed, frankly. I was hoping to go back to the days of my youth-- Edgeworth: You mustn't allow yourself to be taken in by Mr. Wright's whimsical tales, Your Honor. I've read about it in various literature, you see... And they all say that time travel is just not logically feasible. Phoenix: Nnnnngh... Maya: Hmm... Maybe our argument was just a little too nonsensical, Nick... Phoenix: ......Well, in that case... ...why don't we put \"common sense\" to the test? Edgeworth: Excuse me? Phoenix: The wedding reception was held twice. The photos are proof of that. But it wasn't because of time travel. It's simply because the reception had actually been held twice. Isn't that the most reasonable way to interpret the situation? Judge: Hmm... Would you care to elaborate, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: (If time travel doesn't exist, then there's only one way to make sense of what happened!) Somebody must've orchestrated this strange phenomenon. And that somebody is... Everyone at the reception Leads to: \"What if all of the guests at the reception conspired together...\" Gloomsbury Phoenix: Mr. Gloomsbury! Judge: ......Hm? Edgeworth: And how exactly did a dead man orchestrate such an event? And more importantly, why? Phoenix: W-Well, it was... ...to make it look like Mr. Sprocket had been successful in his research...? Edgeworth: What are you asking me for?! Besides, none of the other people interviewed... ...thought that he had succeeded in accomplishing time travel! Phoenix: Your Honor, could we rewind time... by just a teeny bit? Judge: Sorry, but no. Phoenix: (I'd better rethink this quick, before I lose any more time, too.) Leads back to: \"Somebody must've orchestrated this strange phenomenon. And that somebody is...\" The gods Phoenix: Such a mysterious phenomenon could only have been caused by... ...the gods themselves! Judge: Hmm... I suppose the gods would be able to rewind time... ...or make the wedding reception happen twice, wouldn't they? Phoenix: Indeed they would, Your Honor! Judge: In that case, Mr. Wright... ...please bring these gods here to testify before this court. Phoenix: Um, Maya...? Do you think you could...? Maya: ...Not a chance. Judge: On behalf of the gods who can't be here today, please, have some divine punishment. Phoenix: (I knew I was reaching with that one... I guess I'd better come up with something more grounded next time...) Leads back to: \"Somebody must've orchestrated this strange phenomenon. And that somebody is...\" Phoenix: What if all of the guests at the reception conspired together... ...to hold the reception twice and keep quiet about it? Edgeworth: What? ......And for what purpose would they conspire to do such a thing? Phoenix: ......Well, uh... .................. *clap clap clap clap* ???: Ha ha ha! A brilliant deduction, defense. Nichody: I can tell that you are not a renowned lawyer for nothing. I must say, I underestimated you. Phoenix: How so, Mr. Nichody? Nichody: You have managed to name each event, precisely as they happened. You have revealed it all to the light of day. Phoenix: Th-Then, that means... Nichody: It was us. We orchestrated the whole thing. Yes, the reception was held twice. But not because of time travel, no -- we simply held it a second time. Edgeworth: WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Why?! Why would you do such a thing?! Nichody: To make it as though the murder Miss Ellen committed... never happened. Edgeworth: Nnngh! Nichody: Master Sorin figured that if Miss Ellen, who'd killed Gloomsbury after the first reception... ...experienced the reception one more time, she would think it was all a dream. It was he who ordered us to make it happen. However, only a few, myself included, knew of Miss Ellen's crime. Judge: Are you saying most of the guests attended two receptions without knowing why? Nichody: Indeed. They needed no reason... Master Sorin told them to do it, and do it they did. That is the Sprocket way. Phoenix: Then who hid the body in the lantern? Nichody: We did. But we did not anticipate the petals finding their way in, nor the actions of Mr. Butz. Edgeworth: And that's how you intended to cover the whole situation up?! Nichody: There is just one thing everyone here has wrong. The real scene of the murder was not the hold. It was the vista deck. Phoenix: What?! Th-Then Ms. Wyatt's recollection of the events must be correct! Nichody: I admit we tried to cover this incident up. But the fact that Miss Ellen killed Gloomsbury is undeniable. Judge: This is quite a turn of events! ???: ......... ......Heh heh heh. Edgeworth: And so it appears we have arrived at the truth at last. Phoenix: Now, now... Edgeworth: Please do feel free to travel back in time, Mr. Wright... ...and attempt to do this trial over again. Go on. Phoenix: Let's not get hasty, Edgeworth... Edgeworth: I bet you can't do it! Phoenix: I bet I can't, eeeeeiiiither! Edgeworth: Your Honor, we will have to hold a separate trial for the cover-up conspiracy later. But as far as this case goes... ...I believe we are ready for your ruling. Judge: Hmm... Phoenix: Phoenix: Just before the defendant lost consciousness during her attack... ...she says she saw someone strike the victim. It's possible that this third party is the true culprit! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You still want us to believe the defendant's words? Perhaps you've lost more than your touch during your time abroad. This \"third person\" nonsense is nothing but rubbish, and you know it! Phoenix: Phoenix: But, by the same token... ...how can we trust those who conspired and lied to fool this court of law? For all we know, they might still be hiding something! Edgeworth: Nrgh... You never know when to quit, do you?! Judge: Now, now. Calm down, both of you. In any case, there isn't enough trustworthy information yet for me to render a verdict. I suggest we continue the trial after both sides have investigated the matter further. Edgeworth: ......Nnnnrrrrgh. Very well, Your Honor. Phoenix: (Phew! That was close...) Judge: Mr. Nichody... As for you and your cohorts' attempt to cover up this crime... ...your case will be brought to a separate trial following the resolution of this current one. Nichody: Understood, Your Honor. Judge: Well, then... This concludes today's trial. Court is adjourned! To be continued Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor, I have a feeling this piece of evidence contradicts the witness's statement! Judge: ...A \"feeling,\" defense? Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor... Or, rather, a \"hope\" that it indicates a contradiction... Judge: Mr. Wright. Is there or isn't there a contradiction here? Phoenix: It looks like there is... but there really isn't one, is there? Judge: Are you asking me, Mr. Wright? Because what it really seems like to me is you're asking for a penalty! Phoenix: Thanks for that definitive answer, Your Honor... Edgeworth: *sigh* With a lawyer like you, Mr. Wright, even I feel bad for the defendant. Phoenix: (Well, you don't have to feel bad for her for long! I'll get it right next time, you'll see!) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor, the witness's statement contains a glaring contradiction! And this is the piece of evidence that says it all! ............. ............... Judge: ...Will it start saying something anytime soon, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: ............ ............ ...It's not speaking up at all, is it? Maybe it's being shy? Judge: ...... Your evidence has said nothing at all to this court. But your choice of tactics speaks volumes about you, defense! Maya: Even I knew that wasn't a very smart move, Nick... Phoenix: Arrrngh... Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: The witness's statement is inconsistent with this piece of evidence! Edgeworth: ...Mr. Wright. Would you care to tell this court what percent sure you are of your claim? Phoenix: Why, of course! I'm a hundre--! Well, er... ninety... Wait, maybe eighty-ish...? W-Would you accept... fifty percent? Judge: Mr. Wright! I won't have such half-hearted bluffing in my courtroom! Edgeworth: Your Honor. Might I recommend that the defense be penalized with one-hundred-percent severity? Judge: Oh, I intend to, Mr. Edgeworth! You can be sure of that! Phoenix: Nngh... (Guess I can't say I deserved zero percent of that...) Consult (when evidence must be presented) Phoenix: So, what do you think we should do now, Maya? Maya: That one statement sounds awfully fishy to me, Nick. Phoenix: ...Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. Maya: So now it's just a matter of deciding which piece of evidence to present, right? Phoenix: Yeah. I'll take another look at the evidence and compare it to that statement, then. Consult (when statements must be pressed) Phoenix: So... what now? Maya: Well, you can press the witness some more... ...and try and get new information out of them, right? Phoenix: Right. (Guess I'd better get down to pressing the witness, then.) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! I see no need to further prolong this trial. The defense's case is insufficient to overturn the prosecution's claims! This court finds the defendant, Ellen Wyatt... Guilty Turnabout Time Traveler Image Gallery Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 September 22, 1:48 PMWright Anything Agency Athena: Whaaaaaaaaaaaaat?! So the whole time traveling thing... ...was just a ruse put on by the guests at the reception? Phoenix: Looks like it. I knew there had to be some kind of trick to it. Athena: Wow. Two wedding receptions! Can you imagine? I wonder how much THAT must've cost them! Phoenix: I-I have no idea... But if you have to ask, you're not rich enough to want to know... Still, if you've got the money, it's a pretty good way to cover things up, if you ask me. Athena: You got that right...! I'm sure I would've been completely fooled. Maya: Hi! I'm back! Phoenix: Hey, Maya. Are you all set to go? Maya: Yup! Ready when you are! So! What should we start with? Phoenix: Hmm... Let's start with reviewing what we learned at the trial. What Ellen thought was time travel was really just a performance put on by the Sprockets. But other than that, it seems that what Ellen told us was actually all true. Maya: So what really matters right now is... ...the identity of the mystery person Ellen said she saw while she was being attacked! Athena: So, who IS this mystery person? Phoenix: That's the million-dollar question, I'm afraid. But if we want to clear Ellen of any suspicion, then figuring out who they are is key. Athena: I think I'll take \"Toilets\" for $200, instead, Mr. Wright... Phoenix: Well, at least there were only so many people on that airship that night. And we know who the mastermind of the whole cover-up plot was, too, so that's good. Athena: You mean the groom, Sorin Sprocket, right? Phoenix: Exactly. He might know something that could help us out. ???: So then, what am I doing here? Larry: I'm a very busy man, you know. Phoenix: Well, all of the other people involved are Sorin's family members. So I thought I'd better start by interviewing you. (Even if I probably shouldn't trust a word out of your mouth...) Larry: Oh, man... I have a really tight schedule, but... aw heck, what are friends for, right? Okay, pal! Go ahead, ask me anything! Phoenix: (Um, you DO remember it was you who came to me for help in the first place, right...?) Talk The incident Phoenix: I want to go over exactly WHAT happened WHEN before I step outside this office again. Since you were there, Larry, do you think you could help me get it all straight in my head? Larry: *sigh* If I gotta... Phoenix: Okay. So, the first reception was held at 7 PM on the day of the incident. That's the one you tried to crash, right? Larry: Huh? Oh, yeah, that's right. And then they locked me up in a cabin! It was awful, I tell you! Phoenix: (Too bad we're not here to focus on you, Larry.) And then the incident occurred after this first reception, at around 10 PM. Ellen was attacked in the reception hall by Gloomsbury. He forced her out onto the vista deck and was just about to kill her... Larry: But Elly fought back, and ended up killing ol' Gloomsbury instead. To cover it up, the family quickly threw together a second reception. That's what Edgey is claiming, anyway. But I know my Elly didn't do it! Phoenix: The key point here is the mystery person Ellen said she saw strike Gloomsbury... ...just before she passed out. Did you see anybody suspicious skulking around that day? Larry: Nope. Not a soul! Because I was locked up in a cabin at the time! Phoenix: But you managed to escape, and sneak back into the reception hall. That's when you switched the lantern in the event hall with the lantern in the hold, right? Did you see anybody then? Larry: Nope. The place was completely deserted. I guess 'cause that Pierce butler guy had everybody gathered together somewhere. Phoenix: That makes sense. He must've been going over the cover-up plan with them. (So, clearly, the murder had already happened by the time Larry got out...) They must've gotten everything ready fast, and had the second reception soon after that. Larry: Then, after that second reception, Elly went to clean up the reception hall... ...and, as luck would have it, that's when she found the body in the lantern I'd brought up. I tried to do something nice for Elly out of the goodness of my heart, and THIS happened! Phoenix: Hmm... We still don't know exactly what happened during the actual murder itself. We'll just have to look into it, along with the identity of that mystery person... The cabin (appears after \"The incident\") Leads to: \"So while the murder was taking place, you were locked up in a cabin.\" Phoenix: So while the murder was taking place, you were locked up in a cabin. Did you see anything unusual while you were in there? Larry: In the cabin? Let's see... Well... there was that pterodactyl flying through the sky! That's pretty unusual! Phoenix: Oh, right. That drawing of that \"pterodactyl\" you \"saw\"... Larry: What's with all the air quotes?! I really did see it! I swear! Phoenix: But, Larry, the time travel thing never actually happened. Which means you couldn't have seen a real pterodactyl flying through the sky! Larry: O-Oh... Are you doubting the eye of a super-popular picture book author?! Phoenix: No, I'm sure you saw something else, and mistook that for a flying reptile. Larry: Niiiiiick! You're making me doubt my own eyes! Now I'm not even sure WHAT I saw! Larry's Drawing updated in the Court Record. Phoenix: Either way, you have no idea what actually happened at the real scene of the murder? Larry: That's right! And I can say that with every confidence! Oh, wow. Would ya look at the time? I'd better go. I have a book signing to get to. Phoenix: A book signing? Whose book? Larry: Whose do you think?! It's mine, of course! It's a Laurice Deauxnim book signing! Phoenix: I bet you went around and begged a bunch of bookstores to let you do one. Larry: O-Of course not! Th-They're the ones coming around to beg ME! Phoenix: (Looks like I guessed right...) Larry: A-Anyway, I have to go! I'll send you ten copies of my new book that just got released the other day, all right?! Phoenix: T-Ten? That's very generous of you... Larry: What are you talking about? I'm gonna send you the bill, too, of course. Just put 'em down as office expenses or something. Well, see ya! Phoenix: W-Wait, Larry! We don't need... ...Argh. He's gone. Athena: I'll take a copy, Boss! Oh, and make sure it's signed! Phoenix: Oh, boy... (Trucy's not gonna like this \"office expense.\") Maya: There goes our first lead. What do you want to tackle next, Nick? Phoenix: Right, we should really hit the streets now, huh? How about we go see Ellen? Athena: Sounds good, Boss! I bet I can cheer her up! Phoenix: I thought you were going to help Trucy with her magic show again today, Athena? Weren't you supposed to go meet her right about now? Trucy said she was going to practice her new trick on you, if I recall. Athena: \"On me\"...?! Really? Phoenix: Trucy's show is an important source of income for our agency, you know. You can leave the case to us, so you go ahead and run along, now. Athena: B-But, Boss...! Phoenix: Off you go, Athena! Athena: Nooooo... I don't wanna dieeeee... Phoenix: We'd better get going, too, Maya. Maya: Okay! Talk Any ideas? Maya: ............ Phoenix: Why the long face, Maya? Maya: I can't believe time travel isn't real after all... Phoenix: I see... Maya: I thought I'd get to go back in time and see real dinosaurs and ninjas and stuff! Phoenix: Yeah... Too bad, huh? (I couldn't be more relieved, personally.) What to do Phoenix: So, what should we do? Maya: Oh, I don't know... I mean, shouldn't we just keep investigating stuff or something? Phoenix: (She's really lost that spark... ...ever since I proved that time traveling wasn't real in court today...) September 22Detention Center - Visitor's Room Ellen: Oooooh... My poor, sweet Sorin...! I wonder how he's getting along without me... Phoenix: Hello, Ellen. Ellen: Oh, Mr. Wright! What's going to happen with the trial, do you think? Phoenix: Well, first and foremost... ...we have to hurry up and find this mystery person you saw just before you passed out. Ellen: Do you think that person could be the real killer? Phoenix: It's quite possible. And if we can prove that, we can clear you of all charges. Actually, would you happen to know where Sorin is right now? Ellen: He's usually busy with meetings all afternoon, but he should be home by evening. Phoenix: I think I'd better go have a chat with him later, then. (Why am I being treated to a view of someone's underwear...?) Ellen: Mr. Wright! Don't tell me... ...you suspect my sweet Sorin?! Phoenix: Well, he is the one who masterminded the second reception after the \"time skip\"... ...so I thought he might be able to tell us something. Ellen: How COULD you, Mr. Wright?! You can't possibly think--! My Sorin would NEVER kill anyone! Phoenix: A-All right, all right! Just calm down! Ellen: NO, not if you're accusing my Sorin! Phoenix: Please! I'm not accusing anybody! So please put the pan and ladle down, all right? Ellen: Really...? Phoenix: C-Cross my heart. So, for now, would you mind if I ask you a few more things about the case? (I'd better be careful not to provoke her...) Talk Sorin Phoenix: Could you tell me about Sorin? Ellen: There's nothing to tell! He's squeaky clean! Phoenix: A-All right, okay! (Maybe I should avoid the topic of Sorin right now.) L-Let's talk about something else, then. Ellen: Fine, but you won't hear a peep out of me about Sorin! Phoenix: (Talk about pulling teeth...) Pierce Nichody (appears after \"Sorin\") Phoenix: Could you tell me about Pierce Nichody, then? Ellen: Pierce... He came to Sprocket Manor about a year ago. As the family butler, he's now in charge of everything in the household. Phoenix: Only a year ago? Did he have some kind of special connection with the family? Ellen: I'm just a maid, so I'm not privy to such things, I'm afraid. Phoenix: (It might've been Sorin's order, but Pierce is the one who coordinated the whole thing. He's the one who really orchestrated the grand \"time travel\" farce. He must have quite a bit of authority in that family...) But, no matter how good he is at his job... ...how could anybody gain that much influence in a single year? Ellen: I really don't know... I mean, he IS an excellent butler. Wouldn't that explain it? Phoenix: (Hmm... Is it really as simple as that?) Time travel (appears after \"Pierce Nichody\") Phoenix: What you thought was time travel was really just a cover-up carried out by your in-laws. Pierce said Sorin was the one who ordered the whole thing. Ellen: I still can't believe it. Even if the second reception was fake... ...Sorin would never use time travel for something like that! He's very serious about his time machine research, you know! Phoenix: I heard there's a reason he's researching time machines, actually... ...Something about \"something he wishes he could change\"... But isn't the whole idea of traveling back in time itself a little... fantastic? Ellen: I don't think so! After all, Sorin said real time travelers do exist! Phoenix: Really, now? You think he knows someone who actually traveled through time? Ellen: That's right. I haven't seen it personally, but Sorin said as much... ...so I believe it. Phoenix: (Somebody who actually traveled through time, huh? It's pretty hard to believe...) Thank you, Ellen. Ellen: You're going out to do your investigation now, aren't you? Phoenix: Yes, that's right. Ellen: Please make sure you don't cause Sorin any trouble, okay? Phoenix: I'm afraid... I can't promise you that. Ellen: Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?! Please! Whatever you do! Please don't upset my poor Sorin any further! I'm begging you! Phoenix: I-I'll do my best to not cause him any unnecessary trouble. Ellen: Ooh, I couldn't bear it if Sorin ever came under suspicion! I'd rather be found guilty myseeeeeeeelf! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Phoenix: Yikes! Ellen, please! Don't work yourself up like this! You don't want Sorin to worry, do you? Ellen: N-No. You're right... Phoenix: (And the flood waters recede once more...) Maya: So what do we do now, Nick? Phoenix: Well, Ellen said Sorin is usually in meetings until the evening, so... ...let's save our house call until then. Why don't we go to the mooring dock and figure out our next move from there? Maya: Roger, Nick! Time travel (subsequent times) Phoenix: What you thought was time travel was really just a cover-up carried out by your in-laws. Pierce said Sorin was the one who ordered the whole thing. Ellen: I still can't believe it. Even if the second reception was fake... ...Sorin would never use time travel for something like that! He's very serious about his time machine research, you know! Phoenix: I heard there's a reason he's researching time machines, actually... ...Something about \"something he wishes he could change\"... But isn't the whole idea of traveling back in time itself a little... fantastic? Ellen: I don't think so! After all, Sorin said real time travelers do exist! Phoenix: Really, now? You think he knows someone who actually traveled through time? Ellen: That's right. I haven't seen it personally, but Sorin said as much... ...so I believe it. Phoenix: (Somebody who actually traveled through time, huh? It's pretty hard to believe...) After clearing \"Time travel\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: September 22Sprocket Park - Mooring Dock Phoenix: So, where should we start? Maya: Hmm... Let's see. Are there any places we haven't examined yet? We already investigated the reception hall, and Sprocket Manor... Phoenix: ...I know! We haven't looked at the vista deck or the hold yet! Maya: Hey, you're right! We've still got some pretty important places left to examine, don't we! The vista deck is the actual scene of the murder, right? Phoenix: And the lantern with the body in it was stored in the hold. I think there's a good chance we'll find some important clues in those locations. Maya: Do we know how to get to the hold? Phoenix: Good question. I think it was labeled in that diagram of the airship in this pamphlet. Maya: There it is! Phoenix: Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go! Examine Mooring tower Maya: So that one little tower is all that's keeping the airship from being blown away? Phoenix: Apparently. It must be sturdier than it looks. Maya: You know what it reminds me of? A single mom raising three kids while holding down a full-time job! Phoenix: S-Sure... (Where did that analogy even come from...?) Bench Phoenix: A strong wind blew this bench straight through the air, apparently. Maya: It looks like they fixed the sign, but left the bench right where it landed. I wonder why. Phoenix: Maybe the repair guy just hasn't gotten around to it yet. September 22Flying Chapel - Hold Phoenix: So this is the hold... (This is where Pierce orchestrated the whole cover-up operation... We'd better go over this place with a fine-tooth comb.) Maya: Hey, Nick...? Weren't we supposed to need a key card to get in here? Phoenix: Huh, you're right. I wonder why it was unlocked? ???: How's it going, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Ema! What are you doing here? Ema: Just a little independent investigating, for my own sake. Gotta keep the mind sharp! Phoenix: (Ah, so the door's security system was turned off for the police investigation.) We'd like to investigate the hold ourselves. Would that be all right? Ema: Yeah, sure. The police just finished their examination anyway. Phoenix: Thanks. We'll just take a quick look around, then. Ema: Oh, right! You should know that the floor doubles as a huge lift. You can use that lever way back there to raise it up to the vista deck. The police inspected it already, but didn't find anything of particular interest, it seems. If you do go up to the vista deck with the lift, be careful not to fall off! Phoenix: Got it. Thanks. Ema: That goes double for you, Maya! Maya: Yes, ma'am! Phoenix: Well, let's get this show on the road. Examine Engine or \"VISTA DECK\" sign Phoenix: So this is the airship's engine. It's pretty impressive. Maya: And it's all rhythmic, like a heartbeat! It's the literal heart of the Flying Chapel! Look at all those huge gears spinning around and around and around and around and... Ulp! I think I'm starting to get dizzy... Phoenix: Yeah... Me, too... Glassware Phoenix: These must be the dishes and glasses they use for receptions. Very fancy. I bet we'd be in big trouble if we broke any of them. Maya: Ooh! I wanna see, Nick! Phoenix: You, young lady, need to stay far, far away from them. Maya: Nick! You think I'm going to break them, don't you?! Phoenix: Let's just say your rap sheet for breaking things doesn't help your case. Flowers Maya: These are the flowers we saw in Larry's photo! Phoenix: The petals make them look like little gears. The perfect flower for the Sprocket family, huh? Maybe they were going to shower the couple with the petals? Maya: You mean, kind of like how people throw rice or confetti? Phoenix: Yeah, like that. Only, these were found at the scene of a murder instead... Model plane Maya: Ooh, look, Nick! It's an airplane! Phoenix: I wonder if Sorin built that one, too. Maya: Hey, why don't we take it for a spin? Just a quick tour around the neighborhood! Phoenix: And who do you propose is going to pilot that wooden deathtrap? Maya: Me, of course! Who else? Don't worry. I've seen people fly airplanes on TV plenty of times. Phoenix: Um... I think I'll pass. (I've still got my whole life ahead of me!) Bell Phoenix: What's that? A wedding bell? Maya: According to the pamphlet... ...it's used on the vista deck during wedding ceremonies to bless the newlyweds. Phoenix: I guess they disassemble and store it away here in the hold when it's not being used. Cake Maya: Ooh, it's a cake, Nick! A cake! It's so big, they wouldn't miss one little piece, would they? Phoenix: If you're that in the mood for a mouthful of styrofoam, knock yourself out. Maya: You mean it's not real...? Well, it sure fooled me... I was so ready to have some that I'm really craving cake now... Come on, Nick! Let's go get some! Phoenix: Maybe after the trial is over... Pegacow lanterns Phoenix: So there are two male Pegabull lanterns in the reception hall. That must mean... ...that these two are female Pegacow lanterns. Maya: Larry got their sexes mixed up when he replaced the one in the reception hall, huh? Didn't he see the horns? The difference is pretty glaring, if you ask me. Phoenix: And yet he managed not to notice. That's what makes Larry Larry. (And Larry being Larry is why I've seen more than my fair share of trouble for a lifetime...) Ema: Oh, Mr. Wright...? You know that lantern the victim was found inside of in the reception hall...? I'm just about to go piece it back together so the police can examine it. Phoenix: Oh? Okay. We'll stop by for a look, too, once you're done fixing it. Lever Phoenix: Oh, look. There's the lever to the lift Ema told us about. Maya: Let's try going up on it! I'll go flip the switch. Here goes nothing! Phoenix: Wait! I'm not even on it yet! H-Hey, Maya! Stop the lift! Maya: Whoops, sorry! I got a little carried away! Phoenix: Never mind that. Move over a little! Maya: O-Okay... Phoenix: Is that... blood? Ema: B-Blood? Let me see! Phoenix: Could it be Mr. Gloomsbury's blood? Ema: Well, this lift goes up to the vista deck where the murder took place, so... ...I think that's the most logical conclusion. Phoenix: (But I thought the victim was clubbed to death and that there wasn't much blood...? Something tells me I'd better take a picture of this...) Lift Bloodstain added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (I should ask Ema about it some more later.) Maya, can you bring the lift back down now? Maya: You got it! I'll go flip the switch again! There! Done! Phoenix: I want to find out some more about that bloodstain... But, for now, I guess we should go up to the vista deck... ...and take a look around the actual crime scene for ourselves. Maya: The view must be great from up there! I bet it'll be awesome! Phoenix: ...You mean, it would be, if it wasn't the scene of a murder... Maya: Okay! To the vista deck we go! Make sure you actually get ON the lift this time, Nick! Phoenix: I know, I know. Maya: Okay, I'll just flip the switch again, and... awaaaay we go! Maya: Wow! Look at the gorgeous view! Phoenix: So this is where Ellen was attacked, and Mr. Gloomsbury was killed... Yeesh. One wrong step, and it's \"kersplat!\" on the ground below. Maya: Should we go investigate the stuff that's a little closer to the edge? Phoenix: Well, I don't see much of anything over there. The police investigation didn't turn up any clues either, so... Maybe we don't need to? Maya: Oh, I get it! You're SCARED, aren't you, Nick? Phoenix: O-Of course not! C'mon, let's go back down and finish checking out the hold! Lever (subsequent times) Phoenix: It's the lever for the lift... What should we do? Go up to the vista deck Phoenix: Let's go up to the vista deck again. Maya: Okey-dokey! Aaaand up we go! Phoenix: Ugh... Well, I guess there really isn't anything to see up here... Let's go back down to the hold. Maya: But we just got here! Let's enjoy the view a little more! Phoenix: Time's a-wasting! L-Let's go, Maya! Maya: Aww... Leads back to examination Check out the bloodstain Phoenix: Maya, could you operate the lift for me? I want to see that bloodstain again. Maya: You got it! I just have to stop it partway up, right? So, first I'll throw the switch... there! Then, I'll press stop! Phoenix: Yeah... That's quite a bit of blood, all right. It's dry, but it doesn't look all that old. Maya: Do you think it's from the murder? Phoenix: I think so, but I'd need more info to be sure. Could you bring the lift back down now? Maya: Aye-aye, sir! Leads back to examination Leave it alone Phoenix: We'd better just leave it alone. Maya: Awwwww! I wanted to throw the switch! Phoenix: Maybe later... Leads back to examination Candelabra Phoenix: Huh? It looks like there are some fingerprints on this candelabra. Ema: Yeah. I just got done dusting that. I was able to pull a set of left hand prints. Phoenix: Do you know whose prints they are? Ema: Yes. The prints belong to the victim, Dumas Gloomsbury. Maya: Nick! I just figured out something amazing! Phoenix: You did? Maya: Get this -- if the fingerprints on the candelabra were from his left hand... ...then Mister Doom-n'-Gloom must've been... left-handed! What do you think of that? Do I have the makings of a great detective, or what? Phoenix: (You're a real silly Sally if you thought THAT deduction was in any way Encyclopedic...) (Changed from [Oh, yes. Your deductive reasoning skills are nearly Encyclopedic...] in the original release) Ema: Hey, you're pretty good, Maya! I looked into it myself, and sure enough, the victim really was left-handed. Maya: Really? I got it right? Awesome! Phoenix: Uh, good for you, Maya. Maya: \"Good for you\"? That's all you've got to say? Phoenix: I, uh, think you did a real great job, Maya. Way to go! (I guess one can never have too much info...) Maya: Now you're talking! Heh heh heh! Phoenix: But, come to think of it... ...this candelabra isn't in the photo Larry took of the hold, is it? Maya: That picture was taken when they were getting ready for the first reception, right? The candelabra must've been brought in here sometime after that, then. Phoenix: Hmm... It's still possible it has something to do with the incident, though. I'd better add it to the evidence file, just in case. Candelabra added to the Court Record. Ema: Oh, by the way, Mr. Wright... You can have this fingerprint powder, if you like. Phoenix: You're giving this to us? Ema: Sure. I have four other sets. Phoenix: Th-Thanks... (I feel like there's something more to the candelabra, but I can't put my finger on it...) Candelabra (subsequent times) Maya: I wonder where they sell candelabras like these... Phoenix: What, are you looking to buy some? Maya: I was thinking they'd be perfect for the altar candles in the Channeling Chamber at home. It might class up the place a little! Phoenix: I dunno... I can't really see them fitting in with the vibe of Kurain Village... Talk The incident Phoenix: Any progress with your investigation? Ema: Nothing conclusive yet, I'm afraid. Almost everybody was involved with the cover-up... ...so it's hard to know who or what to believe. Phoenix: I know what you mean. Ema: Unless you have some compelling evidence, I'm afraid it's going to be a tough trial for you. Phoenix: You're telling me... There isn't much time left, so I've just got to make do and see what I can turn up. The candelabra (appears after examining candelabra) Phoenix: Ema, can we check out this candelabra a little more? Ema: A little more? What do you-- Oops! Phoenix: Wh-What happened?! Ema: I almost dropped the candelabra, and the candles slipped off. Phoenix: Well, let's be careful with that. It might be important evidence. Ema: Wait a minute... Phoenix: Now what? Ema: One of the pins that hold the candles is broken. Phoenix: What? Ema: There's definitely something fishy about this candelabra! Phoenix: There is? What makes you say that? Ema: Call it forensic investigator's intuition! We already dusted this for prints earlier... ...so let's test it with luminol this time! Phoenix: (Knowing Ema, she'd use every test she has at the same time if she could...) Ema: Just hang on. This will only take a second. Phoenix: (I hope this turns up a new lead somehow...) Well, Ema? Did you find anything? Ema: Take a look at this, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: What is all that blood doing on there?! Candelabra updated in the Court Record. Ema: Maybe somebody got hurt while they were setting up for the reception? These pins are pretty sharp. Phoenix: But if one of the pins is broken... ...it means there was some force involved. Do you think maybe somebody got stabbed? Ema: B-But nobody reported anything like that... Phoenix: (That's quite a bit of blood. I wonder whose it is... If I have anything that might shed some light on that, I should probably show it to Ema...) The candelabra (subsequent times) Phoenix: Ema, can we check out this candelabra a little more? Ema: A little more? What do you-- Oops! Phoenix: Wh-What happened?! Ema: I almost dropped the candelabra, and the candles slipped off. Phoenix: Well, let's be careful with that. It might be important evidence. Ema: Wait a minute... Phoenix: Now what? Ema: One of the pins that hold the candles is broken. Phoenix: What? Ema: There's definitely something fishy about this candelabra! Phoenix: There is? What makes you say that? Ema: Call it forensic investigator's intuition! We already dusted this for prints earlier... ...so let's test it with luminol this time! Phoenix: (Knowing Ema, she'd use every test she has at the same time if she could...) Ema: Just hang on. This will only take a second. Phoenix: (I hope this turns up a new lead somehow...) Well, Ema? Did you find anything? Ema: Take a look at this, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: What is all that blood doing on there?! Ema: Maybe somebody got hurt while they were setting up for the reception? These pins are pretty sharp. Phoenix: But if one of the pins is broken... ...it means there was some force involved. Do you think maybe somebody got stabbed? Ema: B-But nobody reported anything like that... Phoenix: (That's quite a bit of blood. I wonder whose it is... If I have anything that might shed some light on that, I should probably show it to Ema...) The bloodstain (appears after presenting Lift Bloodstain; before clearing \"The candelabra\" Talk option) Phoenix: Ema, about this bloodstain... Ema: I'm thinking it's probably the victim's blood. Phoenix: But the victim was clubbed to death, right? Ema: Yeah, but he could've been bleeding from his nose, or maybe he spat it out. I won't really know for sure until I look into it some more. Phoenix: I see. (There's still something about it that bothers me, though...) The bloodstain (appears after presenting Lift Bloodstain; after clearing \"The candelabra\" Talk option) Phoenix: About this bloodstain... Ema: What about it? Phoenix: There's something about it that's been bothering me. Ema: Oh, yeah? What's that? Phoenix: Well, there's a huge bloodstain on the crime scene lift, and a bloodstained candelabra... Now, this is only a guess, but I'm thinking maybe these two bloodstains are from... The same source Leads to: \"I'm thinking maybe these two bloodstains are from the same source.\" Different sources Phoenix: I'm thinking maybe these two bloodstains are from completely different sources. Ema: Yes, that's what I'm thinking, too. So, what about it? Phoenix: (Oh, hmm... Being in agreement won't lead us anywhere new... I need to find out more about these bloodstains somehow...) Sorry! That's not what I meant to say... Leads to: \"I'm thinking maybe these two bloodstains are from the same source.\" Phoenix: I'm thinking maybe these two bloodstains are from the same source. Ema: Hmm... I guess that IS a possibility. Phoenix: Can we compare the two bloodstains? Would that take a lot of time? Ema: Are you kidding? Don't underestimate the power of science! It'll be done in a jiffy! Ema: And the results are in! That didn't take long, now, did it? Hmm... It seems that the blood from the lift and candelabra are from the same person. Lift Bloodstain updated in the Court Record. Candelabra updated in the Court Record. Phoenix: Well, the victim was clubbed to death, and there wasn't all that much blood... Ema: But if this isn't Mr. Gloomsbury's blood... Phoenix: Well, this is just a guess, but... ...what if Mr. Gloomsbury stabbed somebody with the candelabra pin? That would explain both the huge bloodstain on the lift and the blood on the candelabra. Ema: Oh, my goodness! If that's true... ...then that means there was somebody else present at the scene of the murder! Phoenix: It does, doesn't it? (This just might substantiate Ellen's statement about a third person!) Ema, could you have this blood analyzed? Ema: Sure thing! The bloodstain (after clearing \"The candelabra\" Talk option; subsequent times) Phoenix: About this bloodstain... Ema: What about it? Phoenix: There's something about it that's been bothering me. Ema: Oh, yeah? What's that? Phoenix: Well, there's a huge bloodstain on the crime scene lift, and a bloodstained candelabra... Now, this is only a guess, but I'm thinking maybe these two bloodstains are from... The same source Leads to: \"I'm thinking maybe these two bloodstains are from the same source.\" Different sources Phoenix: I'm thinking maybe these two bloodstains are from completely different sources.

If that's true... ...then that means there was somebody else present at the scene of the murder! Phoenix: It does, doesn't it? (This just might substantiate Ellen's statement about a third person!) Ema, could you have this blood analyzed? Ema: Sure thing! Present Lift Bloodstain Phoenix: Ema, about this bloodstain... Doesn't something about it strike you as odd? Ema: What's so odd about the victim's blood? Phoenix: That's not exactly... There's just something about it that bothers me. Ema: Hmm... Now that you mention it... ...I can't say I necessarily disagree with you. Phoenix: (Maybe I should talk about this some more with her...) After clearing \"The incident\" Talk option, correctly clearing \"The bloodstain\" Talk option, and examining Pegacow lanterns: Phoenix: Hmm... A mysterious bloodstain on a candelabra with the victim's prints on it... This just might be the thing to back up Ellen's memory of seeing a third person. Next up, the reception hall. It might be worth taking another look around in there. Ema: The reception hall? The forensics team is in there investigating right now. Phoenix: Oh, they are? Maya: Well, we don't have time to just sit around, so let's go check out something else! Phoenix: Good idea. We could go question some people. (Especially Sorin. I have quite a few questions for that guy.) Maya: Sounds good, Nick! Ema: Off to do some legwork, then? Phoenix: Yup. I thought we'd head to Sorin's house for starters. Ema: He was accompanying the police on their investigation here earlier, but... ...he's probably home by now. Phoenix: Great, thanks. Later, Ema. Wright Anything Agency or Mooring Dock Present Lift Bloodstain Phoenix: To think they fought for their lives here, on what was supposed to be an uplifting day... Maya: Nick! You do realize this a murder case, right?! Phoenix: Huh? D-Did I say something wrong? Maya; What are you thinking, making such an insensitive pun about this lift?! Phoenix: (What pun? All I said was that it was supposed to be an uplifting day... Oh. Th-That wasn't supposed to be a pun!) Maya: I strongly suggest you don't say anything like that in front of the Sprocket family! Phoenix: Y-Yes, ma'am... Candelabra Maya: That's quite a fancy candelabra, huh? Maybe I should get a few just like it for the altar in the Channeling Chamber at home. Phoenix: I can't really see these things going well with the vibe of Kurain Village... Maya: But they're perfect! They can even hold the really big candles! And they look so cool, too! Phoenix: (That's going to be one eclectic altar once Maya's done redecorating...) September 22Sprocket Manor - Foyer Maya: I still can't get over how gorgeous Sprocket Manor is! Phoenix: Just don't touch anything. Maya: I--! I wasn't going to! Phoenix: (She was DEFINITELY going to...) ???: I was told I had guests... Phoenix: Thank you for seeing us, Sorin. We know you're busy. We'd like to ask you a few questions about the case, if you wouldn't mind. Sorin: ............ Phoenix: Um... Sorin? Sorin: You're Ellen's lawyer, right? Phoenix: Huh...? Y-Yes, that's right. (Don't tell me he doesn't remember me...?) Sorin: ...Will Ellen be found guilty? Phoenix: We're doing everything we can to prevent that. That's why we're here, investigating. Will you please tell us what you know? Sorin: ............ Phoenix: Sorin...? Sorin: .........All right. Fine. Phoenix: (What was that pause all about?) Examine Photos on table Man: Aha! Come back to hear more about my camera, have you? Phoenix: I-I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I'm really busy right now. Man: Oh. What a shame. Well, if you ever want to talk about cameras, come back and see me anytime. Phoenix: (Sounds like even his own family members don't want to listen to him...) Bouquet Maya: Hey, Nick! Better watch out, or you'll be cursed by the bouquet of woe. Phoenix: Oh, come on, Maya. Like I'm going to believe an urban legend you just made up. Talk The cover-up Phoenix: It was you who gave the order for that large-scale cover-up plan, isn't that right? Sorin: What \"large-scale cover-up\"...? Maya: Don't play dumb with us! You held two wedding receptions in order to try and cover up Mr. Gloomsbury's murder! Phoenix: Ellen thought that, through the power of the Time Keeper you built... ...she traveled back in time. Sorin: Ah... So that's why there were two receptions... Phoenix: (Wait, does he seriously not know why the reception was held twice? Looks like I'll have to delve deeper here...) Time travel (appears after \"The cover-up\") Phoenix: So, the cover-up scheme -- that fake trip through time... ...you're not the one who was behind it all? Pierce Nichody stated in court that you were the one who ordered it to be carried out. Sorin: Pierce said that...? I see. I leave him in charge of everything around me. So whatever he decides is, in essence, my decision, too. Phoenix: So I take it that you didn't know anything about the cover-up? Sorin: ......That's none of your business. Phoenix: But you were in two wedding receptions in a row! And still, you claim to know nothing? Sorin: ...I have nothing more to say to you. Please leave. Phoenix: B-But, Sorin...! Ow! Maya: Oh, there's something written on this paper airplane! Let's see... \"Go away!\" Phoenix: It doesn't get clearer than that, huh... (He's looking especially uncooperative, but... ...maybe I can grab his attention somehow. There's still that one piece of evidence I don't know much about... It's worth a try...) Present Selena Sprocket Photo Sorin: Sis... Phoenix: I'm sure your sister would want the truth of this case to be known. Sorin: ...How rude. Is intruding on the private lives of others... ...a part of your job as a lawyer? Phoenix: Oh... I, uh... I apologize. (I guess showing him the picture of his sister wasn't such a good idea after all.) Candelabra (after clearing \"Time travel\" Talk option) Leads to: \"Sorin, have you ever seen this before?\" Phoenix: Sorin, have you ever seen this before? Sorin: Th-That's... That's...! Phoenix: Sorin, what is it? Sorin: N-Nothing...! Phoenix: (Why did his whole demeanor change all of a sudden? He's gone pale as a ghost, too...) *thud* Phoenix: S-Sorin! Maya: Nick! Look at his stomach! He's bleeding! Phoenix: S-Somebody, help! Sorin's collapsed! Maid: Master Sorin! Relative: Get him to the hospital! Quickly, now! Maya: Poor Sorin... That must be one serious wound... Phoenix: Hmm... Maya: What is it, Nick? Phoenix: Well, when I showed him the candelabra, his whole demeanor changed... So I was just thinking that maybe his injury is... Maya: Huh? What's this? Phoenix: It's Sorin's notebook. He must've dropped it in the rush to get him to the hospital. Maya: Ooh, his notebook, huh...? I wonder what's written in it. Don't you? Come on! You know you wanna take a peek! Phoenix: Sorin's notebook... What to do, what to do...? Take a peek Leads to: \"I feel guilty, snooping around in somebody's personal notebook, but...\" Don't look Phoenix: I really don't think we should... Maya: But it might have some really, really, REALLY important information in it! Phoenix: Yes, that's quite possible, but still... (Well, I guess it IS for Ellen's sake, at the end of the day...) Leads to: \"I feel guilty, snooping around in somebody's personal notebook, but...\" Phoenix: I feel guilty, snooping around in somebody's personal notebook, but... ...maybe we SHOULD take a little look-see. Whoa! It's filled with big words written in tiny letters! I guess he uses this notebook to write down his invention ideas? ...Huh? Maya: What is it? Did you find something? Phoenix: Hmm... After March 8th of last year, the content of this notebook changes dramatically. Maya: Like how? Phoenix: Well... Ever since that date, Sorin's been writing down every detail of his life. As in EVERY. Maya: Maybe he decided to start keeping a diary? Phoenix: But this is way too detailed to be an ordinary diary. Maya: Hmm... Either he's really compulsive... ...or maybe just plain forgetful. Phoenix: (But is it really as simple as that...?) I feel like something happened on March 8th that made Sorin change. Maya: Well, why don't you let me take a look at that, and I'll tell you! Phoenix: H-Hey! Maya! Let go or we'll rip it! Maya: Eep! Now look what you did! You dropped it! You should've just let me take a look! Phoenix: (How is this MY fault...?) Maya: Oh, no! Nick... Phoenix: Ack! It fell into that pool of Sorin's blood! I can't read a thing on these two pages now... Maya: Uh-oh! You're gonna get it now! Phoenix: (Ugh... I guess it really is my fault after all...) Let's just put it away carefully for now. We can't let anything else happen to it, you hear? Sorin's Notebook added to the Court Record. Maya: Huh? Hey look, there's something sticking out of the notebook. It looks like a newspaper article. Phoenix: Let's see... It's about the car accident Sorin's sister died in! It happened on... March 8th... That's the day Sorin's notebook completely changed... Oh, wow! Maya: Wh-What else does it say?! Phoenix: It says the driver at the time of the accident was... Dumas Gloomsbury. It says Sorin was in the car, too, and that he had sustained severe injuries. It's just like Pierce said. Sorin completely changed after the accident. Newspaper Article added to the Court Record. Phoenix: So Gloomsbury was driving the car when they got into that accident... That opens up the distinct possibility... Maya: Of...? Phoenix: Of Sorin holding a grudge against Gloomsbury. Maya: You think Sorin could've...? Phoenix: I don't know. It's not like I have any proof... We should talk to Pierce about this when we return Sorin's notebook to him. ...Though he doesn't seem to be here right now. Maybe he's at the Flying Chapel. Wright Anything Agency or Reception Hall Present Sorin's Notebook Maya: Oh, it's the notebook you dropped! Phoenix: The notebook \"I\" dropped?! It only ended up where it did because you tried to snatch it out of my hands! Maya: Well... maybe I was a TINY bit complicit in it... Look! No one's to blame here, right? It was just an accident! Right?! Phoenix: Oh, I think we both know who's more to blame... Newspaper Article Maya: This is about the car accident Sorin's sister died in... I bet she would've wanted to see her little brother get married... Phoenix: Yeah... But with the way things are, I don't think she'll be able to rest in peace. So we'll just have to figure out the truth somehow... For her sake, too. Maya: Yeah. Let's not leave a single stone unturned and push on in our investigation! September 22Sprocket Park - Mooring Dock Phoenix: I sure hope Pierce is around here somewhere. ???: Ah, Mr. Wright and Ms. Fey. Phoenix: Hello, Pierce. We were just looking for you. Nichody: I'm sorry for Master Sorin's sudden departure earlier. You have my sincerest apologies. Phoenix: It was totally understandable, really. But shouldn't you be at his side right now? Nichody: It's fine. The other servants are with him, and I am in constant contact with them. Do not forget to give him his pain medication, and be sure to keep him hydrated. Also, see to it that he is not up and about. He needs complete bed rest. Phoenix: (Is this what happens when you're too rich for normal, peasant phones...?) Nichody: I must return to Master Sorin now, but... ...did you want something of me? Phoenix: Actually, here's Sorin's notebook. He dropped it when he collapsed. (I hope Pierce doesn't notice the bloodstain!) Nichody: Oh. Thank you very much for this. I will see to it personally that Master Sorin gets it back. Phoenix: Thank you. Sorin's Notebook given to Pierce. Nichody: I trust you did not look inside? Phoenix: Oh, of course not! Aha ha! Nichody: Because it is filled with numerous patent-worthy ideas, you see. Phoenix: Look, I know you're busy, but would you mind if I asked you a few questions about the case? Nichody: Well, as I said, I must be getting back to Master Sorin. So if you could make it quick, I would greatly appreciate it. Phoenix: All right. I'll make this as quick as I can. Talk The cover-up Phoenix: I'd like to ask you about the cover-up you tried to pull off, if you don't mind. Nichody: I told everything there is to tell in court already. Disposing of anything that may harm the Sprocket family's reputation... ...is simply a part of my job. Phoenix: (Sounds like a lovely job description...) Nichody: I have nothing more to say on the matter. I will say, I do not think it's wise to spend time on topics that have already been discussed. Phoenix: Right. The accident (appears after \"The cover-up\") Phoenix: Pierce, could you tell us more about this accident? Nichody: Where did you find that...? And did I not already tell you about that accident? Phoenix: You did, but you conveniently left out one crucial detail: The fact that Dumas Gloomsbury was driving the car at the time. Nichody: Oh? Did I not mention that? I suppose it simply did not come up then. Phoenix: If Mr. Gloomsbury caused the accident... ...why didn't the Sprocket family fire him? Wouldn't that usually be the natural consequence of such a huge mistake? Nichody: Please do not misunderstand. Gloomsbury stayed on with the family... ...on Master Sorin's request. Phoenix: (What...?) Nichody: That is the type of person Master Sorin is. Perhaps it was the influence of Miss Selena's kind nature. She was such a sweet person that even in her last moments, she thought of Master Sorin. Phoenix: (Not only did Sorin NOT hold a grudge against Gloomsbury, he insisted on keeping him on. Now I REALLY don't understand how that guy's mind works...) Selena's last moments (appears after \"The accident\") Phoenix: So you were present for Selena Sprocket's last moments...? Nichody: Yes, in my professional capacity... The accident happened on the way to a certain party. Phoenix: And what kind of a party was it? Nichody: It was Miss Selena's engagement party. Gloomsbury's injuries were minor, but Miss Selena's and Master Sorin's were critical. They were brought to the Sprocket family's regular hospital. Phoenix: (Wow... To have such a terrible thing happen on what was to be a day of celebration...) Nichody: Thanks to the surgeon in charge, Master Sorin pulled through. But Miss Selena... She... Phoenix: ............ Nichody: The last words Miss Selena said to me were... \"Please help Sorin.\" Nichody: Ever since then, I have attended Master Sorin and tried to help him in any way I can. Phoenix: I see... Selena's fianc\u00e9 must have been devastated. Nichody: Indeed. The shock of losing Miss Selena was so great, he quit being a surgeon. Phoenix: He was a surgeon? Wait... So the surgeon who tried to save them both, was he...? Nichody: Yes, he was Miss Selena's fianc\u00e9. Maya: What a terrible tragedy... Phoenix: How awful... So where is her fianc\u00e9 now? Nichody: ...Good question. I wonder that sometimes myself. Phoenix: (So Selena had a fianc\u00e9... I'd like to find out more about him, but I doubt I'll find him any time soon.) Nichody: So, are we done here? I'm afraid I must be going. Phoenix: Could you please just tell me... ...a little more about Sorin? Nichody: There is nothing more to tell. Phoenix: (I can't seem to get any real answers out of him just by asking him questions. But there IS that piece of evidence I still don't know much about... Maybe he'll be able to tell me something about it.) Selena's last moments (subsequent times) Phoenix: So you were present for Selena Sprocket's last moments...? Nichody: Yes, in my professional capacity... The accident happened on the way to a certain party. Phoenix: And what kind of a party was it? Nichody: It was Miss Selena's engagement party. Gloomsbury's injuries were minor, but Miss Selena's and Master Sorin's were critical. They were brought to the Sprocket family's regular hospital. Phoenix: (Wow...

Nichody: ...Good question. I wonder that sometimes myself. Phoenix: (So Selena had a fianc\u00e9... I'd like to find out more about him, but I doubt I'll find him any time soon.) Pierce's secret (appears after correctly presenting Candelabra) Phoenix: Pierce. You're hiding something from me about this candelabra, aren't you? Nichody: It is one of the candelabras from the Flying Chapel, is it not? Is there something special about it? 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (My magatama is definitely reacting. I guess I'll just have to break those Psyche-Locks and find out what he's got to hide!) Present Magatama Phoenix: 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Pierce's Secret -- Phoenix: Pierce. You're hiding something from me about this candelabra, aren't you? Nichody: It is one of the candelabras from the Flying Chapel, is it not? Is there something special about it? Phoenix: Actually, yes -- there's some blood on it, you see. I think the blood might belong to this person. Present Sorin Sprocket profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Sorin has a rather nasty wound on his body, doesn't he?\" Present anyone else Phoenix: Nichody: What does that person have to do with it? Phoenix: (Ack! That's not who I meant to name!) Nichody: I do not have time for meaningless conversation... Phoenix: I'm sorry! Please give me another chance! Leads back to: \"I think the blood might belong to this person.\" Phoenix: Sorin has a rather nasty wound on his body, doesn't he? Nichody: Ngh... 1 LOCK BROKEN Nichody: Yes, Master Sorin is indeed injured. Phoenix: Are any of the other people involved with this case injured? Nichody: N-Not as far as I know... Phoenix: ...I see. Then, let me ask you this, Pierce. Do you suppose Sorin could have been more directly involved than you're letting on? Nichody: Wh-What in the world would make you think that...? Phoenix: Oh, I've got my reasons. Mr. Gloomsbury's fingerprints were found on this candelabra's stem. Which leads me to believe that Mr. Gloomsbury stabbed Sorin with it. Nichody: You cannot possibly think Master Sorin is the one responsible for the murder. Phoenix: I don't have any conclusive evidence of that at the moment... ...but I do think he had a motive. This proves that Sorin had a motive to kill Mr. Gloomsbury. Present Newspaper Article Phoenix: Leads to: \"Even though it was an accident...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Nichody: How does that prove that Master Sorin had a motive to commit the murder? Phoenix: Huh? (Wrong piece, I guess!) Never mind that. I didn't mean it! Nichody: My time is limited, Mr. Wright, so please do hurry. Leads back to: \"This proves that Sorin had a motive to kill Mr. Gloomsbury.\" Phoenix: Even though it was an accident... ...Mr. Gloomsbury was the man responsible for taking Sorin's sister away. 1 LOCK BROKEN Nichody: Let us suppose... that Gloomsbury did stab Master Sorin with the candelabra... Can you prove that it had anything to do with this case? He might have been stabbed at some other location, for some other reason... Phoenix: Sorry, but I can prove it WAS related to this case. Nichody: Oh, really? Phoenix: Sorin's stabbing and Mr. Gloomsbury's death are definitely connected. Nichody: Are they now...? Phoenix: This is the piece of evidence that ties Sorin's injury to Mr. Gloomsbury's murder. Present Lift Bloodstain Phoenix: Leads to: \"A bloodstain was found on the side of the lift that goes between the hold and vista deck.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Nichody: ...I'm not sure what you're trying to tie together with that. Phoenix: (Argh! Guess that wasn't it!) Nichody: I'll have a servant send you home... Phoenix: No, wait! Please give me another chance. Nichody: Please, Mr. Wright. Do not detain me with nonsense any longer... Leads back to: \"This is the piece of evidence that ties Sorin's injury to Mr. Gloomsbury's murder.\" Phoenix: A bloodstain was found on the side of the lift that goes between the hold and vista deck. Its blood matches the blood that's on the candelabra. I obtained the results straight from the police, so I can assure you this information is correct. Nichody: ............ Phoenix: This bloodstain on the lift indicates an important fact. It shows us that... The murder was in the reception hall Phoenix: The true scene of the murder was in the reception hall. Nichody: ............ ............ ............ ............ Phoenix: All right, so I kinda just said the first thing that popped into my mind... ...but now that I think about it, I take it back. Nichody: ...Twenty-six seconds, Mr. Wright. It took you twenty-six seconds to realize your mistake. Phoenix: Look, just please forget about that one! Nichody: *sigh* Leads back to: \"This bloodstain on the lift indicates an important fact. It shows us that...\" Sorin was there during the crime Leads to: \"Sorin's blood is on the lift, which can only mean one thing.\" Gloomsbury wasn't there Phoenix: Mr. Gloomsbury wasn't at the crime scene! Nichody: How does the bloodstain on the lift tell you that? Phoenix: Well, er... I guess it really doesn't, does it? Nichody: If you insist on speaking nonsense, I will have to ask you to let me leave. Phoenix: N-No more nonsense this time! I promise! Leads back to: \"This bloodstain on the lift indicates an important fact. It shows us that...\" Phoenix: Sorin's blood is on the lift, which can only mean one thing. He was there, wasn't he? Sorin was at the scene of the crime. Nichody: You are very astute, Mr. Wright. It appears I cannot hide this from you any longer. Very well. I will tell you everything. 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Pierce's secret (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Leads to: \"Could you tell me about Sorin's injury?\" Present Selena Sprocket Photo Nichody: I hope you will refrain from showing this to Master Sorin. He is still suffering the loss of Miss Selena. Phoenix: B-But... Nichody: I do not believe rubbing salt in people's wounds is part of a lawyer's job. Or am I mistaken? Phoenix: A-All right. I understand. Candelabra or Lift Bloodstain (before clearing \"Selena's last moments\" Talk option) Phoenix: Do you recognize this, Pierce? Nichody: ...It is not really something I care to look at. Phoenix: But it was you and the others who tried to cover things up in the hold, wasn't it? Nichody: I left that entirely to my subordinates, so I really don't know anything about it myself. Phoenix: (Pierce was in charge of handling the guests and relatives... ...so he must know a lot more than he's letting on.) Candelabra (after clearing \"Selena's last moments\" Talk option, before breaking Psyche-Locks) Phoenix: Pierce. Have you ever seen this candelabra before? Nichody: I-I... No, I don't know anything about it... 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (My magatama reacted! Pierce must be trying to hide something from me. I have to break those Psyche-Locks and find out what!) Candelabra (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Phoenix: Sorin was stabbed by Mr. Gloomsbury, right? Nichody: Yes, it is just as I told you earlier. And then, after he had been stabbed, Master Sorin did make his way to the vista deck... But that was after Gloomsbury had been murdered. Phoenix: (Well, it's a fact that Sorin was injured... But now I really don't know what's the truth and what's fiction anymore...) Nichody: It matters not if you believe me or not. If this comes up in court, I will say the same thing to prove Master Sorin's innocence. Phoenix: Well, I guess I'll believe you... for now. Nichody: Heh. Newspaper Article Nichody: Even now, it is painful to remember the accident. And Master Sorin is not the only one who suffers still. The entire Sprocket family was plunged into deep sorrow. A sorrow they still feel to this day. Phoenix: (Now I can understand why Sorin changed so much after the accident...) Nichody: That is why I do not want you to bring up the car accident again. I hope you understand. Phoenix: Y-Yes, I understand. (So I guess that topic is out...) Phoenix: Could you tell me about Sorin's injury? Nichody: ...Very well. This is what I heard directly from Master Sorin himself. As you surmised, Master Sorin was stabbed by Gloomsbury on the day of the murder. It happened after the first wedding reception. The happy couple was in the reception hall when, suddenly, Gloomsbury appeared... He attacked Miss Ellen and tried to take her away. Master Sorin went to stop him, and found himself in a struggle with Gloomsbury. That is when Master Sorin was stabbed with the candelabra, he said. Even though Master Sorin was badly injured, he went after Gloomsbury. Phoenix: So Sorin really was at the scene of the murder, wasn't he? Nichody: Yes, that is correct. However, by the time Master Sorin arrived at the scene... ...Gloomsbury had already been murdered. Phoenix: (So Pierce is saying that Sorin WAS at the crime scene... ...but that he didn't have anything to do with the murder itself. Hmm...) Even still, why did you try to keep such an important piece of information from me?! Nichody: I am very sorry. Master Sorin's injury and Gloomsbury's murder were not directly related... ...so I decided not to mention it, so as not to unnecessarily complicate the investigation. ...Now, then. I am sorry, but I am afraid I really must go now. Please excuse me. Phoenix: Thank you for your time. Maya: Pierce should've just told us everything in the first place and saved us all a lot of time! Phoenix: Yeah... But I guess it isn't that simple for him -- he is the family butler, after all. He sure didn't make our job any easier, though, did he? But at least we learned something new. Sorin was at the scene of the crime! Maya: That's true! One step forward is better than none! So, what next, Nick? Phoenix: Hmm... Let's see. The forensics team might be done investigating the reception hall by now. Let's go check it out. Maya: Sounds like a plan! Wright Anything Agency, Foyer, or Hold Talk Any ideas? Phoenix: Is it just me, or does Sorin seem kinda suspicious...? Maya: Yeah... I mean, he's so quiet, who knows what he's thinking, right? And that Pierce isn't exactly an open book, either. It seems like they're both hiding something. Phoenix: Yeah, though that could be true of everyone involved in this case, for all we know. Maya: Hey, I know! Let's make a new rule! The next time anybody lies in court, we get to bop them on the head with the judge's gavel! Phoenix: Sounds more like a game of Whack-A-Mole than a trial to me... Still, I wouldn't necessarily say no... What to do Maya: What's wrong, Nick? Phoenix: Oh, I was just thinking about how hard it's been to find out the truth this time around... Maya: What are you talking about? When has it EVER been easy to find out the truth in any of our cases? You just do what you always do! Bluff your way through things, and we'll be fine! Phoenix: (But that's supposed to be my tactic of last resort...) September 22Flying Chapel - Reception Hall Phoenix: It looks like the police are done with their investigation in here. I wonder if it's okay for us to take a look around now. ???: Oh, hi, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Hi, Ema. Would it be all right if we investigate in this room now? Ema: Sure. The police are all done, so go for it. Oh, remember that broken lantern? I restored it to perfection! I have to say, it's some of my best work! Phoenix: (Sounds like the repair job was a resounding success...) Thanks, Ema. We'll take a good look at it, too. Ema: Well, I have to be getting back to the station... Try not to mess up the crime scene if you can help it. Phoenix: We'll be careful. Ema: I'll be seeing you! Maya: Bye, Ema! And thank you! Phoenix: Well, shall we get started? Examine \"EXIT\" door Phoenix: Hey, take a look at that door. I wonder where it goes. Maya: Shall we open it up and see? Maid: Wait! Please don't open that! It's the emergency escape hatch! It leads directly outside! You'll fall to your death! Phoenix: Whew... That was a close one, huh, Maya? Maya: I-I'll say... Fog machine below model plane Maya: Excuse me. Is the fog machine ready to use now? Maid: No, I'm afraid not. We only put dry ice in it when there's an actual reception. Maya: I see... That's too bad... Phoenix: (She still wants to blast me with a cloud of smoke, doesn't she...) Sweetheart area of reception hall Windows Maya: It's another beautiful day outside, isn't it? Phoenix: Yeah. If only it wasn't the scene of a murder, we could really enjoy it... Maya: True... Phoenix: It must be tough for the maids to have to work on a beautiful day like today. Maid: Oh, we don't mind. Phoenix: Whoa! I didn't think you could hear me way over here! Maid: We don't think of it as simply cleaning. It's more like we're wiping away all of the sadness stuck to this airship... Phoenix: (Wow. Talk about devoted...) Sweetheart table Maya: Hey! I think that tablecloth is new. They must've changed it since yesterday! Phoenix: Huh? How can you tell? Maya: Because the food stains that were there are now gone! Phoenix: (I should've known it's because it's food-related...) Smaller table Phoenix: This is where the murder weapon, the Time Keeper, was displayed. I guess it's in police custody now. ...Huh? What's this? A key? Maya: Let's ask the maid about it. Phoenix: Good idea. She might be able to tell us something. Excuse me. Could I ask you a question? Maid: Oh, of course. What would you like to know? Phoenix: Do you know anything about this key? Maid: It's the key that starts up the Time Keeper. Phoenix: A startup key? Maid: That's right. Oh, the First Startup of Love ceremony was so beautiful! The bride and groom each had a symbol of their love, and when they put them together... Oh, how romantic it was! Key of Love added to the Court Record. Phoenix: First Startup of Love ceremony? What exactly did that entail? Maid: Oh, er... It's a ceremony in which the couple activated the Time Keeper together for the first time. I suppose it was kind of like a cake-cutting ceremony. Phoenix: And what are these \"symbols of their love\" you mentioned? Maid: Well... that's kind of an industry secret, so I can't really say. I'm sorry. I'd better be getting back to my work...

Repaired Pegabull lantern Phoenix: Here's the broken lantern, all patched up. (And I do mean \"patched\"...) Maya: Ema said this was some of her best work, so I know she put a lot of effort into it! Phoenix: It was pretty smashed up. It must've been a lot of work to piece it back together. (Well, she gets an A for effort, at any rate...) ...Huh? This wheel handle on the back has some blood on it! It looks like somebody gripped it with a bloody hand... Maya: Maybe the blood got there when the killer was putting ol' Doom-n'-Gloom's body inside? Do you see anything else worth noting? Phoenix: Well, there's another one of these lanterns over there... ...so it might be a good idea to really compare the two later. Broken Lantern updated in the Court Record. Repaired Pegabull lantern (subsequent times) Maya: Ema must've worked really hard on this. Maid: You mean that police lady? She was going at it like a jigsaw puzzle. All \"Not this piece\" here, \"Not that piece\" there... Phoenix: It was pretty busted up. I can just imagine what a hard time she had figuring it all out. Maya: She should've asked me to help! I would've loved to restore this thing with her! Phoenix: I think it's best to leave that kind of thing to the police. (Besides, who knows what kind of liberties Maya would've taken in the process...?) Intact Pegabull lantern Maya: ...N-Nick! Phoenix: What's wrong, Maya?! Maya: ......This hasn't moved an inch since the last time we looked at it. Phoenix: (It would be pretty creepy if it had...) Look, we're in the middle of an important investigation, so try not to shout, okay? Maya: I was just hoping it had changed somehow. You know, so it would be more interesting. Phoenix: The last thing we need is for things to get more \"interesting.\" Intact Pegabull lantern (after examining repaired Pegabull lantern) Phoenix: This is the unbroken Pegabull lantern. And this is the one that Ema restored. I wouldn't say they look exactly the same... More that they're made up of the same parts. Maya: Wait a minute... Phoenix: What is it, Maya? Maya: I think there's something off about this Pegabull. Phoenix: Just about everything about it looks off to me... Maya: I'm not quite sure what it is, but some detail isn't quite right. Show me the restored lantern again. Phoenix: Hey, I know! It's this, right? Maya: What? Where? Phoenix: The thing about the restored lantern that's off is the... Shape of the horns Phoenix: The shape of the horns is different, isn't it? How they're curved, and their size, and stuff? Maya: I don't know... The curve and size seem the same as the unbroken one to me. Phoenix: Yeah, I guess you're right. They're pretty much identical, huh. In that case... Leads back to: \"The thing about the restored lantern that's off is the...\" Angle of the wings Phoenix: I've got it! The angle of that wing is different. And it's attached all wrong! Maya: Well duh, Nick! I could've told you THAT! I mean there's something more subtle... Something that feels just slightly off. You know what I mean? Phoenix: (No, not really... Still, maybe it's...) Leads back to: \"The thing about the restored lantern that's off is the...\" Color of the wheel handle Leads to: \"Look. It's the wheel handle. It's a different color altogether.\" Phoenix: Look. It's the wheel handle. It's a different color altogether. Ema got the inside and outside wheel handles switched around. Maya: Oh, wow! You're right! And there's blood here on this handle -- as if somebody gripped it with a bloody hand. Phoenix: Right. Which means that the blood got on the handle from inside the lantern. Broken Lantern updated in the Court Record. Maya: Do you think the blood got there when the killer was putting the body in the lantern? Phoenix: Hmm... It's really hard to say, at this point. Talk Any ideas? Maya: I don't know... I really wonder about that Pierce... Phoenix: Yeah, I know what you mean. He seems to have a lot of power over everybody and everything, doesn't he? Maya: Actually, what I was really wondering about is that shoulder mech of his... I mean, it's pretty amazing how many things that tiny little contraption can do. Ooh! What if that  mech is actually Pierce's true control center, like his brain? Phoenix: Um... Maya...? Maya: And what if, somewhere in Sprocket Manor, he has another shiny, golden body! And then, during emergencies, he can switch bodies and become Super Pierce Nichody! Phoenix: This is what I get for trying to have a serious conversation with a super geek... What to do Phoenix: I bet all Ellen wants is to start her happy new life with Sorin. Maya: Yeah... I bet you're right... Phoenix: But do you think the truth will really set her free...? Maya: All you can do is do your job to the best of your ability! And if we can bring Ellen joy that way, all the better, right?! Phoenix: Maya... Maya: Either way, I think true happiness can only be found in the truth. ... Um, what are you looking at me like that for? Phoenix: I was just thinking about how wise that sounded. Looks like our little Maya is growing up! Maya: Would you knock it off? I'm trying to be serious here! Phoenix: S-Sorry! Sorry! Present Broken Lantern (after examining repaired Pegabull lantern) Maya: Ema did a pretty good job fixing this guy up. Is it just me, or does this Pegabull look happy to be whole again? Still... Phoenix: Still...? Maya: If Ema had let me do it, I could've made it ten times cooler! I would've made the wings bigger, given it three horns, and painted it all red. But that's not all! Phoenix: It would've ceased to be a Pegabull waaay before that point, Maya... After examining \"EXIT\" door, smaller table, and repaired Pegabull lantern, then examining intact Pegabull lantern: Phoenix: Whew! Well, I think we've checked out everything relevant to this case. ???: What are you two doing here? Phoenix: Wait, what are YOU doing here?! Sorin! Shouldn't you be resting in bed? You're injured! Sorin: How do you know about that?! ...Um, never mind. My notebook... Have you seen my notebook? I can't find it anywhere. My notebook... I need my notebook... Phoenix: (What's the matter with him?) Sorin: M-My notebook... I need... I have to have... I-I... ???: Master Sorin! Nichody: Master Sorin! I told you to stay in bed! Sorin: M-My notebook...! Nichody: Here you go. Sorin: Yes... This is it...! Phoenix: (So Sorin gets emotionally unstable without that notebook of his...?) Sorin: ...Phew. Phoenix: (Looks like he's calmed down now.) Sorin, do you mind if I talk to you for a minute? Nichody: I cannot allow you to do that. What if his wound were to open up again? He needs to rest. Phoenix: Arngh... I guess you're right... Nichody: Now, if you will excuse us. Master Sorin, let us retire. Sorin: ...All right. Maya: There they go. Phoenix: Pierce is right. I guess he really isn't in any condition to be questioned. Well, let's go back to the agency and sort through what we've learned. Mooring Dock Talk The incident Phoenix: Hey, Larry... I thought you had a book signing? Larry: Yeah, but I snuck off early. I was worried about how your investigation was going! Phoenix: Nobody came to get their book signed, huh? Larry: What kind of a thing is that to say?! Phoenix: Well, how many people showed up, then? Larry: Well, um... Fine! It was four people, if you gotta know! Including the employees... Phoenix: S-Sorry... I shouldn't have asked... Larry: Quit looking at me like I'm some pitiful piglet! Phoenix: Um, why don't you get back to your signing? Another two or three people could show up before the store closes... Larry: They already put away the book signing table and cleaned everything up! I... I don't have anywhere else to go. Phoenix: Gee, Larry... I'm sorry I gave you such a hard time. Larry: I told you to quit looking at me like that! Ellen Phoenix: So, have you been to see Ellen? Larry: Nah. Edgey told me to stay away. He said things always get complicated whenever I'm around. Can you believe the guy? Phoenix: (Actually, I'd tell Larry the exact same thing if I were Edgeworth.) Larry: So... How's the investigation coming along? Phoenix: We've made some progress, but I don't feel like we've gotten to the heart of things yet. Larry: Come on, Nick! You gotta do better than that! Me and Elly's whole future is riding on you! Phoenix: I-I don't think I can take on the heavy responsibility of your future, Larry. Larry: Whaaat? First, Edgey, and now YOU, Nick? Why does everybody gotta be so mean to me? Phoenix: C'mon, Larry! I really don't have time to be standing around shooting the breeze! Why don't you just get back to your book signing, huh? Larry: W-Will you come with me, ol' buddy...? Phoenix: Not a chance! Larry: Ooooooooh...! Phoenix: (Enough is enough already, Larry...) September 22Wright Anything Agency Phoenix: We're back. Anybody here? Athena: Oh, hi, Boss! Phoenix: Athena? I thought you were with Trucy? Athena: Um... I guess you could say that I'm... I-I'm taking a short break! B-But enough about me! What about the investigation! Did you find out anything? Phoenix: Well, turns out that the third person Ellen says she saw at the crime scene... ...might have been Sorin Sprocket. Athena: What? Really? I always thought he seemed suspicious... Phoenix: Thing is, by the time Sorin got to the vista deck... ...the murder had already occurred, apparently. Athena: No way! I don't buy that! Not for a second! It's a cover-up! A cover-up, I tell you! Phoenix: That's... certainly a possibility. And, as a lawyer, it's certainly a possibility I have to pursue, but... Athena: But what? It's your job, right? So pursue the heck out of it! Just do it! Phoenix: Yeah, but... ...is that really what's best for Ellen? Maya: Sorin could be found guilty if the truth comes out tomorrow... But if we don't pursue this possibility, Ellen could be found guilty instead... Athena: Oh, man... Either way, it sure doesn't spell out \"happily ever after\" for the two of them... So what are you gonna do, Mr. Wright?! Phoenix: I can't let an innocent person get convicted. So I guess all I can really do... is pursue the truth. Even if it ends up devastating Ellen... Athena: What a tough call to make... Maya: S-Still, there's always a chance, right? Maybe something will come up during the trial that will save their marriage! Phoenix: I hope so. I really do... ......Well, Maya, let's go. Maya: Break the news to Ellen, you mean...? Phoenix: Yup. Athena: Mr. Wright! Please take me with you! I bet I could help you counsel Ellen through this piece of bad news! Phoenix: Athena... I appreciate the offer, but don't you have somewhere else to be? Athena: ...Do I? Trucy: Athena! What are you doing here?! I've been looking all over for you! Come on, now! Let's get back to practicing! Athena: N-No... Wait...! My body can't take it anymore! B-Boss, you gotta help me! Phoenix: A lawyer always keeps their promises, Athena. Athena: B-But, Boooooss...! Trucy: If you bail on me one more time, Athena, I'm going to use a real blade on you! Athena: Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek! Phoenix: (Sorry, Athena, but somebody's gotta do it... Better you than me, though... Hang in there, kiddo!) Come on, Maya. We'd better get going. September 22Detention Center - Visitor's Room Phoenix: Hello, Ellen. Ellen: How did your investigation go, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Before I answer that, I need to ask you something. Was Sorin with you when Mr. Gloomsbury attacked you in the reception hall? Ellen: I, uh...... I'm sorry I kept it from you. I was afraid that he'd come under suspicion if I told you. So I kept quiet about it. I'm really sorry... Phoenix: ...I see. I thought it was probably something like that. Listen, Ellen... I'm afraid I had to make a very difficult decision based on what I found out... Ellen: ...What kind of decision? Phoenix: This is... very hard for me to say, but... The mysterious person you saw at the scene of the crime... was most likely Sorin. Ellen: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Phoenix: In other words, in court tomorrow... ...I'm afraid I'll have to propose the possibility that Sorin is the true culprit. Ellen: No... Sorin is innocent... Nooo... Phoenix: But don't you see? If I don't try to pursue that line of thought, you'll be found guilty! Ellen: No... Nooooo... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Phoenix: Please, Ellen! Calm down! Ellen: WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Sorin just can't be found guilty! I'd much rather I be found guilty instead! Maya: Ellen! You can't let yourself think like that! Ellen: But..! But...! But...! Nooooooooooooooooooo! Maya: Marriage is for life, right? Do you really think you can run away from the truth and still be truly happy with him? Ellen: WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! You're not married, so how can you possibly understand?! Sometimes you've just got to do whatever it takes to make things wooooork! Maya: But...! N-Nick, you talk to her... Phoenix: H-Hey! Don't just dump this all on me! Ellen: Mr. Wright! I'm innocent, and Sorin is, too! So, please...! Prove our innocence in coooourt! Phoenix: I... I'll certainly do everything in my power... (I just hope she doesn't lose control like this in court tomorrow...) To be continued Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: Nothing particularly interesting here. Area already examined Phoenix: (We've already searched here, but it never hurts to take another look around.) Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I think I'd better take a step back and gather my thoughts a little more...)\n-- What Sorin Remembers --Sorin: I was stabbed by Dumas in the reception hall, and I collapsed to the floor.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Please tell me everything you can about when you got stabbed. Sorin: After the reception, Ellen and I were enjoying a moment alone in the reception hall. Then Dumas appeared and stabbed me... He grabbed Ellen and the Time Keeper, and left the reception hall. Phoenix: Did Mr. Gloomsbury say anything at that time? Sorin: ...I don't remember. After I was stabbed, I was immobilized by the pain. Phoenix: I see.Sorin: The next thing I saw was Ellen and Dumas on the vista deck.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The vista deck, huh? But it was nighttime then. Could you really see them in the darkness? Sorin: ...The moon was out, so I could see them clearly. From the looks of it, Dumas was trying to push Ellen and the Time Keeper off the side. Edgeworth: So you saw the defendant... ...about to be thrown off the airship, you say? Sorin: ...That's right. Edgeworth: In such a desperate situation, it would only be natural for her to fight for her life. And the murder weapon was right there within her grasp. Phoenix: (Ugh. This isn't going well at all... I've got to do something, fast!)Sorin: I knew Ellen was in danger, so I headed for the vista deck.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: I understand that your bride was in danger, but... ...were you really able to move with a stab wound to the gut? Sorin: ...I was desperately trying to push the pain out of my mind. Phoenix: I see. So adrenaline kicked in, and gave you strength, is that right? (I don't see much of anything in this statement I can refute...) Sorin: That's right. I almost passed out several times as I made my way to the vista deck.Sorin: But when I got there, Dumas was already...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you absolutely sure, Mr. Sprocket... ...that by the time you got to the vista deck, the murder had already been committed? Sorin: ...Yes. Phoenix: But the vista deck is just on the other side of the glass windows in the reception hall. Shouldn't you have been able to get there right away? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Mr. Wright. Have you investigated nothing? The only way to the vista deck is to go to the hold and take the lift. No matter how much one hurries, it would take at least ten minutes. Phoenix: Argh...! (Well, that's unhelpful... But Sorin had to have gotten there before the murder, or my claim won't stand!) Do you have any ideas for me, Maya? Maya: Hmm... It's definitely easier to prove that someone did go to the hold than not... I mean, you can't leave anything if you don't go someplace, right? Phoenix: (\"Can't leave anything\"...? Wait a minute. I think Maya is onto something here! The lack of a certain something actually proves that Sorin didn't go to the hold!) Edgeworth: What's the matter? Are you stumped already? Phoenix: No. I'm far from \"stumped,\" Mr. Edgeworth. I know for a fact that Mr. Sprocket didn't go to the hold! Edgeworth: Hmph. You and your paper-thin bluffs! Mr. Sprocket's bloodstain on the lift proves he went through the hold! So what possible proof could you have that he did not, in fact, go through there?! Phoenix: Y-You want proof, you got it! (You can do this, Phoenix! There's gotta be proof that Sorin didn't go through the hold!) Judge: Well, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: This proves that Mr. Sprocket didn't go through the hold. Present Hold Entry Record Phoenix: Leads to: \"As anyone can see from the hold entry record...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Judge: ............? Edgeworth: ............? Sorin: ............? Maya: ............? Phoenix: Umm... So, maybe this isn't it...? Maya: ...Maybe not. Judge: ...Definitely not. Phoenix: Definitely not, it is...! (Argh...! Come on, Phoenix! Get a hold of yourself and try again!) Leads back to: \"This proves that Mr. Sprocket didn't go through the hold.\"Sorin: I don't want to believe it, but it must've been Ellen. Nothing else makes sense...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: If you didn't make it in time to see the murder itself... ...then who was the third person Ms. Wyatt saw?! Sorin: ...How should I know? That's just a theory you came up with yourself. Phoenix: W-Well... Edgeworth: Mr. Wright, you're trying to force the witness into the role of your \"third person\"... But isn't it possible that the defendant is lying, or that she simply misremembered?! Exactly how trustworthy do you think her memory is?! Phoenix: (No matter how much I believe in Ellen... ...her words won't do us any good in court without proof...!) Sorin: What makes you think I'm this \"third person,\" anyway? Judge: Mr. Wright, can you show proof that the witness was your theoretical \"third person\"? I can Phoenix: I can! (And I would...! If only I knew what that proof was...) Judge: Very well. Then let's see this proof of yours... ...that Mr. Sprocket is the mystery person Ms. Wyatt said she saw. Phoenix: This evidence proves that Mr. Sprocket was the third person Ms. Wyatt saw. Present Lift Bloodstain Phoenix: Phoenix: This proves that Mr. Sprocket was the third person! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: That only proves that Mr. Sprocket went to the vista deck... ...and in no way proves he's your mysterious \"third person\"! Phoenix: Argh... I guess you're right... Maya: Come on, Nick! Stop fooling around! Phoenix: (I guess I can't quite prove who the third person is at this point.) Leads back to cross-examination Present anything else Phoenix: Edgeworth: How on earth does that prove Mr. Sprocket is your \"third person\"?! Phoenix: Huh...? Oh, n-not that! Please ignore that! Forget it ever happened! Maya: Come on, Nick. Stop fooling around... Phoenix: I can do better. Just give me another chance! Leads back to: \"Mr. Wright, can you show proof that the witness was your theoretical \"third person\"?\" I can't Phoenix: Not at the moment, Your Honor, no. Sorin: I suggest you refrain from performing random guesswork in this courtroom. Phoenix: Nnrgh... (But the possibility that it was Sorin still exists! I just have to approach it from a different angle.) Leads back to cross-examinationPhoenix: That was some pretty damning testimony...Maya: Saying that Ellen must've done it -- I don't believe that for a second!Phoenix: I don't believe it either. Let's hope this cross-examination gives us some insight into what actually happened. But first, we'll have to find something to latch onto in his testimony.Phoenix: As anyone can see from the hold entry record... ...there's absolutely no mention of Sorin Sprocket entering the hold!Sorin: ............!Phoenix: The defense asserts that Mr. Sprocket used a different route to get to the vista deck!Edgeworth: You can assert all you want, Mr. Wright... ...but can you actually prove another route exists?Phoenix: Can I prove the existence of another route to the vista deck, you ask?I can Leads to: \"I can prove it!\"Not yet Phoenix: Well, I... (Now that I really think about it, I guess it's going to be hard to prove... But I can't back down now. The trial will be over if I do! There's only one thing I can do at a time like this...)  Leads to: \"I can prove it!\"Phoenix: I can prove it! (Even if it's just a bluff, I have to present something... Anything that could prove the existence of a faster route to the vista deck!)Judge: Very well, then, Mr. Wright. Show us how Mr. Sprocket got to the vista deck.Phoenix: Mr. Sprocket made for the vista deck through here!Present escape hatch Phoenix: Leads to: \"To save his bride from danger, Mr. Sprocket...\"Present anywhere else Phoenix: Judge: ...Mr. Wright. How could anyone get to the vista deck through there? Phoenix: Um... What if he just kinda wiggled his way through here...? Judge: I'm afraid that's physically impossible, defense. Now, stop trying to wiggle your way out of a reasonable explanation! Phoenix: Sorry, Your Honor. Please let me try again. Leads back to: \"Mr. Sprocket made for the vista deck through here!\"Phoenix: To save his bride from danger, Mr. Sprocket... ...opened the escape hatch and made his way along the outside wall to the vista deck! Isn't that right, Mr. Sprocket?Sorin: ............Judge: Hmm... That would certainly be a much faster route to the vista deck...Edgeworth:Edgeworth: *sigh* I'm disappointed, Mr. Wright. Is that really the best you could muster? That escape hatch is not meant to be used to get from the reception hall to the vista deck! One slip, and that's all it would take for Mr. Sprocket to plunge to his death!Judge: I have to agree. The defense's claim is really stretching it.Phoenix:Phoenix: I understand how it sounds, Your Honor! But, at this point, it's too early to definitively say... ...that he didn't go that way!Judge: So that's what you're going with then, I take it?Phoenix: O-Of course, Your Honor!Edgeworth: This is real life, Mr. Wright. Not some cinematic drivel or comic book! Do you have some sort of logical explanation to share that would convince us of your claim?Phoenix: I... I do.Maya: Are you sure, Nick?Phoenix: Um... kind of? (Actually, I have nothing... So I'll just have to wing it somehow!)Judge: On what do you base your theory that Mr. Sprocket made his way along the outside?Phoenix: My theory that he was able to go along the outside wall despite the danger is based on...The power of authority Phoenix: ...the power of authority. A man of Mr. Sprocket's considerable authority could easily move along that wall! I bet his men had ropes and cushions at the ready in case he fell! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: And these \"men\" you speak of... Where in the world would they have come from? Phoenix: Well, um... They'd pop up at the snap of Mr. Sprocket's fingers... Judge: ...I have no idea what you're trying to say, Mr. Wright. Were Mr. Sprocket a man of such great power and influence... ...why would he voluntarily put himself in harm's way? Phoenix: That's... a very good question, Your Honor. Judge: A question you should have asked yourself from the start, Mr. Wright. Maya: Men who appear at the snap of your fingers?! The judge might not appreciate it, but I do! Phoenix: Th-Thanks, Maya... (I guess she's trying to cheer me up... Okay! I have to get it right this time!) Leads back to: \"My theory that he was able to go along the outside wall despite the danger is based on...\"The power of love Leads to: \"To save the bride he loves, the groom risked his life and rushed to her side.\"The power of money Phoenix: ...the power of money. Mr. Sprocket used the clout of currency to move along that wall! After all, you can make anything in this world move with money! Mr. Sprocket's a rich man, so he simply threw his money around to make it happen! Maya: That was... kind of a bogus thing to say, Nick. Phoenix: Huh? Judge: I sense you have something against the wealthy. Edgeworth: Truly, a remark that reflects the meager state of your soul, and your piggy bank. Judge: I don't think money could've helped Mr. Sprocket in this situation. What's more, I suggest you work on enriching your own spirit, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Ngaaah... (Well, I still stand by what I said!) Leads back to: \"My theory that he was able to go along the outside wall despite the danger is based on...\"Phoenix: To save the bride he loves, the groom risked his life and rushed to her side. Mr. Sprocket was able to make it to the vista deck despite the danger... ...because of the power of love!Judge: The power of love? ............ Hmm... That love is a source of strength that can help one overcome any obstacle... I think I can relate, thanks to my own long, happy marriage.Phoenix: (Wow. He actually seems to be buying it!)Edgeworth:Edgeworth: The \"power of love,\" you say? That kind of illogical argument is hardly viable in a court of law! Wouldn't you agree, Your Honor?Judge: I'm afraid not, Mr. Edgeworth. You should never underestimate the power of love. You'll understand one day when you get marri--Edgeworth: Which I won't!Judge: ............Edgeworth: Exactly what is so wrong with wishing to remain unwed?!Phoenix: (Way to set him off, Your Honor...)Edgeworth: Never mind all this unscientific nonsense! Are you aware, Mr. Wright, that at the time of the crime... ...there was a huge propeller turning at full speed between the hatch and the vista deck?! Even if a person were to go outside through the hatch... ...they'd be blown away in an instant!Phoenix: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUGH!Edgeworth: Hmph. Where does your \"power of love\" get you now, Mr. Wright?Judge: A huge spinning propeller, you say? Hmm... In that case, I have to admit it does seem impossible...Phoenix: Arngh! (I should've known...)Maya: ...Nick, you can't make that kind of face in front of your client! The worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles! Right?Phoenix: ......Right! (I feel like I just saw Mia looking out at me through Maya's eyes!)Maya: Wh-What's wrong, Nick? Why are you gaping at me like a giant sunfish?Phoenix: Thank you, Maya! You just helped me remember something really important!Maya: There it is! There's that fearless smile I was looking for! Now give us a mind-blowing theory, just like you always do!Phoenix: (I have to turn my thinking around! Instead of wondering how Sorin could've moved past that huge propeller... ...I have to think about what would've made it possible for him to do so!)Edgeworth: Your Honor. Mr. Wright only makes that ridiculous face when his back is pressed against the wall. Therefore, please do hurry and give your ruling before--Phoenix:Phoenix: Mr. Edgeworth. It's still far too early to discount my theory.Edgeworth: What are you talking about? The airship's large spinning propellers have already shredded it to pieces!Phoenix: B-But if we think a little more outside the box... ...I'm sure we can find a way he could've made it!Edgeworth: Stop trying to stall, Mr. Wright! And show us how it could've been even remotely possible -- if at all!Judge: I must agree with Mr. Edgeworth.Phoenix: V-Very well, Your Honor. (There must've been a way! Some way that Sorin could've moved along the wall in spite of the propeller!)Judge: Now, then, Mr. Wright. What specifically would've made it possible?Phoenix: This is how it would've been possible for Mr. Sprocket to get to the vista deck.He got to the deck some other way Phoenix: Instead of going along the outside wall, the witness got to the vista deck some other way! That's why the propeller is irrelevant to this case! Edgeworth: Really, now, Mr. Wright. Because as I recall, you were the one who was arguing... ...that Mr. Sprocket made his way to the vista deck by moving along the outside wall. Why, then, are you now suggesting that he got to the vista deck some other way? Judge: I agree. This new argument is a complete about-face. Phoenix: Ugh... Yes, well... Judge: What we want to know is, what would make it possible to move along the outside wall? So please refrain from changing horses midstream, defense. Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor... (I'd better think this through a little better...) Please let me try again! Leads back to: \"This is how it would've been possible for Mr. Sprocket to get to the vista deck.\"The airship wasn't flying Leads to: \"What allowed Mr. Sprocket to go along the outside wall in spite of the propellers...\"The propellers were broken Phoenix: I propose that the propellers were broken... ...and, therefore, weren't turning at the time! Judge: Hmm... That does make the theory sound plausible, yes. What do you think, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: I haven't heard any report that the propellers were broken at the time. Besides, if the propellers had broken during the flight... ...the airship would've been careening out of control, would it not? Judge: That would certainly put a stop to the wedding festivities, wouldn't it...? Phoenix: I-I suppose that's true... Edgeworth: Mr. Wright, you will refrain from spouting such groundless claptrap ever again! Judge: Well said, Mr. Edgeworth. And Mr. Wright, here's a penalty to help you remember. Phoenix: (If only the propellers were stopped for some reason... ...it would've made it possible for Sorin to get to the vista deck...) Your Honor, please let me start over! Leads back to: \"This is how it would've been possible for Mr. Sprocket to get to the vista deck.\"Phoenix: What allowed Mr. Sprocket to go along the outside wall in spite of the propellers... ...is the location of the Flying Chapel at the time of the crime!Judge: The location of the Flying Chapel...? But wasn't it flying high in the sky?Phoenix: No, Your Honor, I'm afraid it wasn't.Judge: WHAT?! Th-Then where was it?!Phoenix: At the time of the murder, the airship wasn't flying through the sky... But moored to the ground!Judge: Wh-Whaaaaaaat?!Phoenix: And if the airship wasn't flying, then that means... ...the propellers weren't turning!Sorin: ............Phoenix: In which case... ...Mr. Sprocket could have gotten to the vista deck along the outside wall! Isn't that right, Mr. Sprocket?!Sorin: ...Urk! ......I-I don't remember!Phoenix: (Ow... He stabbed himself with his pencil. That's gonna leave a mark.)Edgeworth:Edgeworth: Even if the propellers weren't turning, it would've been far too risky to go that way!Phoenix: Ah, but, Mr. Edgeworth, you're forgetting about the power of love.Judge: Yes, the amazing power of love...Edgeworth: Not this again...! V-Very well. For the sake of argument, let's assume this so-called \"power of love\"... ...made it possible for Mr. Sprocket to move along the outside wall of the airship. Can you prove that the airship was tied to the ground as you claim, Mr. Wright?!Phoenix: Uh, well, I... (I don't have any evidence that proves where the airship was at the time...!)Edgeworth: You can prove it, can't you?Phoenix: Urgh...! Maya... Can you think of anything we can use to prove it?Maya: Hmm... Can't say I can... Oh, wait! Didn't somebody see something outside a window at the time of the crime...? I think I remember someone saying as much...Phoenix: (Do I have a piece of evidence that shows what was outside the airship?)Edgeworth: Well, what are you waiting for?Phoenix: This piece of evidence shows what was outside the airship at the time of the crime!Present Larry's Drawing Phoenix: Leads to: \"This piece of evidence shows what was outside the airship at the time of the murder!\"Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This piece of evidence shows what was outside the airship at the time! Judge: I must say, I'm impressed by your acuity, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: What do you mean by that, Your Honor? Judge: What I mean is, I can't see how that evidence shows what was outside the airship at all. Please present evidence that even us less perceptive individuals can understand. Phoenix: (There's no need for such sarcasm, Your Honor... Well, I'll just have to do better this time!) Leads back to: \"This piece of evidence shows what was outside the airship at the time of the crime!\"Phoenix: This piece of evidence shows what was outside the airship at the time of the murder!Edgeworth: What kind of lousy drawing is that?Phoenix: It's a drawing made by Larry Butz!Edgeworth: Hmph. And what can you prove with that poor attempt at artistry?Phoenix: Larry made this drawing before he switched the lanterns. So it must've been right around when the murder was being committed. Now, if I could direct the court's attention here!Judge: I-Is that a pterodactyl?! Does that mean... that the airship actually went back in time to the Cretaceous Period...?Edgeworth:Edgeworth: We've already proven that time travel is nothing more than a gimmick, did we not?!Phoenix: We did, and I have no intention of bringing up that argument again. But this drawing shows us an important piece of information. It shows us that the airship was actually moored on the ground!Edgeworth: ...And what makes you so sure?Phoenix: That's easy. All you have to do is consider who made this drawing.Edgeworth: ...Larry.Phoenix: That's right. It was Mr. Butz. And we both know what he's like. He must've seen something else and mistaken it for a pterodactyl.Edgeworth: I... I can't argue with you there.Larry:Larry: H-Hey! Wait just one doggone second here! What kind of moron do you guys take me for?! I saw it with my own eyes! A pterodactyl flew right by the window, I tell you! I have the sharp eyes of an artist! Don't you believe me?!Edgeworth: No.Larry: Niiiick...Phoenix: Nope.Larry: Some friends you guys are! What about the judge? You believe me, r-right, Your Honor?Judge: I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you need to leave this courtroom. Bailiff, if you would.Bailiff: Come on, buddy, let's go!Larry: Why doesn't anybody believe meeeeeeeee?!Phoenix: (Don't take it personally, Larry... I know you're just being... well, you...)Judge: Ahem! Now, then... So you're saying that what Mr. Butz really saw... ...bears some relation to what was outside the airship at the time of the murder?Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor! (At least, I think it does...) What this pterodactyl really is will prove the airship was anchored at the mooring dock! (It had better, anyway. If it doesn't, my whole argument is a bust!)Judge: If you're that confident about it, then please go ahead and tell us what it really was.Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. (Think, Phoenix! What could that pterodactyl have actually been?!)Present sign Phoenix: Leads to: \"Please take a good look at this sign!\"Present anywhere else Phoenix: Judge: THAT'S what the pterodactyl really was? Phoenix: Yes. Don't you see it, Your Honor? Judge: No, quite frankly, I don't. Maya: Sorry, Nick. I'm afraid I don't see it, either. Edgeworth: It's unanimous, then. None of us understand what it is you're driving at, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Nngh... Judge: In that case, I assume we're all in agreement regarding the penalty for such a blunder. Phoenix: Sorry, everyone... (I'd better take a really good look before I answer again!) Leads back to: \"Think, Phoenix! What could that pterodactyl have actually been?!\"Phoenix: Please take a good look at this sign!Judge: At the sign? Hmm... It appears to have been broken, and then repaired. But what does this sign have to do with the pterodactyl?Phoenix: Please focus on this part of the sign.Judge: The part that broke off and got reattached? What about it?Phoenix: How about if we turn it like this?Judge: Oh! Th-That shape! It's the pterodactyl in the drawing!Phoenix: What Mr. Butz actually saw was this chunk as it was being blown through the air by wind!Judge: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!Phoenix: On the day of the murder, there were some heavy winds in the area of the mooring dock. But it's hard to imagine that this sign would make it up as high as an airship would fly. That means, the Flying Chapel must've been anchored at the mooring dock that night! Isn't that right... Mr. Sprocket?!Sorin: Nngh!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: That's more than enough of this \"power of love\" nonsense, you pop culture junkie. Present all the proof you want, but your argument is based far too much in conjecture. Why don't we return to reality now?Phenix: Wh-What do you mean \"too much conjecture\"?Edgeworth: Even if the airship wasn't flying, that alone doesn't prove the witness went along the wall.Judge: True... Even now, it's no more than a possibility.Phoenix: Then how do YOU propose Mr. Sprocket got to the vista deck, Mr. Edgeworth?!Edgeworth: I noticed something as I went over the evidence. Please take a look at this hold entry record.Phoenix: What about it? I don't see Mr. Sprocket listed on here anywhere!Edgeworth: Don't you remember? In yesterday's session, we had a very similar kind of argument.Phoenix: Did we...?Edgeworth: Honestly, Mr. Wright. Are you going senile already? We talked about Larry Butz using the defendant's key card to enter the hold.Phoenix: Oh... We did talk about that, didn't we...?Edgeworth: In other words, even if a person's name isn't on the entry record... ...it's still possible for that person to have entered by using someone else's card!Phoenix: A-AAAAAAAAAAAARGH!Edgeworth: Mr. Sprocket. You entered the hold with Mr. Nichody, didn't you?Sorin: .......... ............I did.Phoenix: What?! Why didn't you tell us that in the first place?!Sorin: P-Pierce is indispensable. I didn't want to mention him unnecessarily, and risk having him wrongly accused. ...I couldn't do without him.Judge: Mr. Sprocket, I ask that you testify in greater detail about your movements that night.Witness Testimony--The Truth--Sorin: The truth is, I went to the vista deck with Pierce. That's why my name doesn't appear on the hold entry record. I was badly injured from being stabbed, but I was frantic. By the time we reached the scene, it was all over.Phoenix: (Well, this doesn't help me one bit...)Edgeworth: Mr. Sprocket, you've concealed information from us time and time again. Who do you think you are, treating this court of law with such irreverence?!Sorin: ............!Edgeworth: ...That being said, I do appreciate the testimony you gave just now.Sorin: ............Edgeworth: Thanks to you, we now know why your name doesn't appear on the entry record. Now there are no more inconsistencies in the witness's testimony!Phoenix: Arngh...!Maya: That's Mr. Edgeworth for you! He never leaves a loose end dangling! You okay, Nick?Phoenix: I wouldn't exactly call this situation \"okay\"... Somehow I'll have to coax the information we need for an opening out of him. (If I even can, that is...)Cross ExaminationCross Examination--The Truth--Sorin: The truth is, I went to the vista deck with Pierce.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You didn't mention this because you didn't want Mr. Nichody to fall under suspicion? Is that because he has something to hide? Sorin: I just didn't want the police to take up his time with all their questions, that's all. Neither the company nor the household would function smoothly without him. Phoenix: I see. (Wow. It sounds like Pierce is absolutely indispensible [sic] to the Sprockets.) Anyway, getting back to your statement... When did you meet up with Mr. Nichody? Sorin: We met up on my way to the vista deck. I think Pierce and some of my relatives were on another floor... But Pierce heard the commotion, and came running to my aide. Phoenix: (He could hear the pandemonium all the way from another floor...?) Judge: Mr. Wright, would you like the current statement added to the witness's testimony? Have it added Phoenix: Yes, please, Your Honor. Judge: Very well. Adds statement \"Pierce heard the commotion, and he came running.\" Leave it out Phoenix: No, thank you, Your Honor. Judge: I see. Very well. Leads back to cross-examinationPress (after adding statement \"Pierce heard the commotion, and he came running.\") Phoenix: Phoenix: You didn't mention this because you didn't want Mr. Nichody to fall under suspicion? Is that because he has something to hide? Sorin: I just didn't want the police to take up his time with all their questions, that's all. Neither the company nor the household would function smoothly without him. Phoenix: I see. (Wow. It sounds like Pierce is absolutely indispensible [sic] to the Sprockets.)

Phoenix: (He could hear the pandemonium all the way from another floor...?)Sorin: Pierce heard the commotion, and he came running.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Did Mr. Nichody come alone?  Sorin: ...I believe some of his subordinates were with him, but... ...I don't remember exactly how many. Phoenix: (He may say there were others, but seeing how they pulled that \"second reception\" off... ...I can't completely trust anything he has to say, either...) I see. So you, Mr. Nichody, and a few others headed to the vista deck, is that right? Sorin: ......That's right.Sorin: That's why my name doesn't appear on the hold entry record.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Your name doesn't appear on the hold entry record... ...because you entered with Mr. Nichody using his key card? Sorin: ......That's right. Phoenix: (So I guess the hold entry record doesn't matter as much as we thought. But now that Sorin's saying he was with Pierce and a few others... ...it's pretty tough to refute that statement.) Edgeworth: What's the matter, Mr. Wright? Cat got your tongue? Did you finally realize there's no point in continuing this trial any longer? Phoenix: O-Of course not! (Grr... I'll wipe that smug look off your face!) Mr. Sprocket, please continue with your testimony!Sorin: I was badly injured from being stabbed, but I was frantic.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Speaking of your injury, how are you doing now? Sorin: The knife wound is deep, and continues to throb with pain. Fortunately, my internal organs were spared... ...but one wrong move would've spelled the end for me there. Phoenix: Even so, I've seen you up and about all over the place since the incident. Sorin: I'm only following my doctor's orders to perform some daily light exercises. Judge: Mr. Wright. Would you like Mr. Sprocket's statement about his condition added to his testimony? ...Not that it appears especially relevant to me... Phoenix: Should I have him add it to his testimony...? Have it added Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. I'd like to have it added to his testimony. Judge: ...I see. Very well. Adds statement \"The knife wound is quite deep, and continues to throb with pain.\" Leave it out Phoenix: That's all right, Your Honor. I think we should leave it out. Judge: Very well. I understand. Leads back to cross-examinationPress (after adding statement \"The knife wound is quite deep, and continues to throb with pain.\") Phoenix: Phoenix: Speaking of your injury, how are you doing now?

Sorin: I'm only following my doctor's orders to perform some daily light exercises.Sorin: The knife wound is quite deep, and continues to throb with pain.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Your injury was really that deep? Sorin: ...Luckily, it missed my internal organs. Otherwise, I wouldn't be alive right now. Edgeworth: According to his doctor, his injury will take about three weeks to heal. There's no way someone with that kind of injury could have gone along the outside wall. Phoenix: Ngh... B-But he might've been able to with the burst of adrenaline brought on by the pain! Edgeworth: Hmph. Adrenaline, adrenaline. Is that your answer for everything? In a court of law, the only thing that matters is evidence -- not rampant speculation! Phoenix: At least admit it's scientific rampant speculation... Sorin: ......May I continue? Phoenix: ...Yes, of course.Present Candelabra Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Sprocket, you just said your injury is a knife wound, didn't you?\"Sorin: By the time we reached the scene, it was all over.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you still insist that you reached the vista deck after the murder had occurred... Is that correct? Sorin: Yes, that's right. Ellen must've killed him. There's no other explanation... Maya: I guess whether Pierce was with Sorin or not doesn't change the outcome... Phoenix: I guess not... In fact, more witnesses actually makes it worse for us...Phoenix: So another cover-up, huh?Maya: That Sorin has too many secrets! I bet he's still hiding other things, too!Phoenix: That's definitely a possibility. But in a situation like this, what we have to do is go back to the basics.Maya: You mean go over the testimony and check for any lies or inconsistencies?Phoenix: You got it.Maya: All right, Nick.

    "cot": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other based on the provided materials. The testimonies are from Sorin Sprocket, and the evidence list includes various items from the game.\n\nFirst, let's look at the testimonies. The key points in Sorin's testimonies are that he went to the vista deck with Pierce, his injury was from a stab wound, and that by the time they arrived, the murder was already over. \n\nNow, looking at the evidences. Evidence 17 is the Candelabra, which has Gloomsbury's left-hand fingerprints and bloodstains. The autopsy report (Evidence 14) states Gloomsbury was hit twice with the Time Keeper. However, Sorin's testimony mentions being stabbed, which would be a knife wound. \n\nWait, the Candelabra's description says it's stained with blood and has Gloomsbury's left-hand prints. But if Sorin was stabbed with a knife, the injury would be from a blade, not a candelabra. However, Sorin's testimony about the knife wound (Testimony 3 and 4) contradicts the evidence if the injury was actually from the candelabra's pin. \n\nBut the Candelabra (Evidence 17) has blood matching the lift bloodstain (Evidence 16), which is Sorin's blood. So if Sorin's injury is from the candelabra's pin, which is part of the evidence, then his claim of a knife wound is a lie. That would mean the testimony about being stabbed (Testimony 3 and 4) contradicts the Candelabra evidence, which caused his injury via the pin, not a knife.\n\nSo, the contradiction is between Sorin's testimony about a knife wound and the evidence showing the injury came from the candelabra's pin. The relevant testimony is Testimony 3 or 4. Let me check the exact testimony numbers. Testimony 3 is \"I was badly injured from being stabbed, but I was frantic.\" Testimony 4 is about the depth of the knife wound. The Candelabra (Evidence 17) shows that the injury was from the pin, not a knife. Therefore, Testimony 3 (or 4) contradicts Evidence 17."

Phoenix: (Probably for all the back-breaking labor they put their employees through...) Lady: By the way, that bull logo on the Flying Chapel -- the one with the rainbow wings? His name is \"Rainy the Rainbull.\" Get it? Maya: I get it! He's a rainbow-colored bull, so he's a \"Rainbull,\" right? What a memorable name, huh, Nick! Phoenix: (Yeah, for the lameness of the pun...) Radio Phoenix: Don't you dare touch that radio again. It looks like an expensive antique. Maya: What are you worried about? If it breaks again, Pierce will just fix it up again! Phoenix: (I really hope he's nice enough to waive the repair bill...) Propeller Maya: Nick! Look at that airplane propeller up there going round and round! Phoenix: I see they've got an aviation theme going on. Makes sense for an airline family. I wonder if it doubles as a fan. Maya: Ooh! What if the rest of the plane were on the other side of the wall?! And the wall would open up so the plane could take off in an emergency! How cool would that be! Phoenix: If that's what's behind the propeller wall, then what's behind the bull wall across the way? Oh, I know! Maybe it's the rest of him! That must be where the Sprockets get their milk! Maya: Nick... First of all, that's a beef cow. And second, bulls don't make milk. Phoenix: Oh. Right... (That's what I get for trying to play along...) Bouquet Phoenix: Oh, it's the bridal bouquet. Maya: Hey Nick, how about I throw it, and you try to catch it? Phoenix: Why me? Maya: Just because. I bet you'd look hilarious flailing around trying to grab it. Phoenix: But doesn't tradition dictate that it's the ladies that go after the bouquet? Maya: Who cares! Just catch it! Here! Phoenix: Ow! H-Hey! You threw that right at my face! Lady: Oh, you don't want to catch THAT bouquet. Trust me. Maya: Why not? Lady: They say it's bad luck to catch the bouquet of a marriage that doesn't last. Phoenix: B-But I already caught it...

A thick fog billows across the room, making it look as if the couple were walking on clouds. Maya: Wow... Look at how beautiful Ellen is here! She looks a little nervous, though. Phoenix: She does, doesn't she. Maya: Hey, look! There's Pierce! Phoenix: Really? Where? Maya: Right there, behind the sweetheart table! Phoenix: Hey, you're right.

Photo of Reception added to the Court Record. Maya: Hey, Nick? If Ellen really did travel back in time... ...do you think this photo is of the second reception -- you know, after the time jump? Phoenix: Hmm... I wonder. Excuse me. Sir? Man: Yes? Can I help you? Phoenix: Ellen told us she traveled back in time. Would you happen to know anything about that? Man: Oh, um... N-No... I-I... I-I haven't the foggiest idea what you're talking about! Phoenix: ? (He clammed up faster than a clam!) Film camera or photos on table (subsequent times) Phoenix: You don't see cameras like this anymore. Maya: That's for sure! Cameras these days are so small and easy to use. But these old retro ones are cool, too! Man: I'm glad to hear you appreciate them. *ahem* This camera was made in the late 1800s. As for this particular model, it is... Phoenix: S-Sorry! We'd really like to hear more about your camera, but we have to go. Maya: Aww, Nick! But it sounds so interesting! Phoenix: We have to get back to our investigation, remember? (Preferably before we get our ears talked off!) Man: Oh, what a shame. We'll have to get together and talk some other time, then. Over tea, perhaps? Card on floor Phoenix: Excuse me, but there's a card here on the floor. Man: Well, look at that. It's a Flying Chapel key card. Phoenix: The Flying Chapel? What areas on the Flying Chapel require a key card, if I may ask? Man: Mostly areas we want to keep the public out of... ...such as the staff room and the hold, which is chock full of machinery. Phoenix: So you can't enter those areas without a key card? Man: That's right... Hm? This one here belongs to Ellen. Phoenix: (Wait, what's Ellen's key card doing here?) Did Ellen come back here after the incident occurred? Man: I don't believe so. And she was arrested by the police straight away this morning. Although... there was a strange man with a gaudy jacket in here earlier. Phoenix: Was that man... wearing a beret, by any chance? Man: Yes, he was, as a matter of fact! He was also wearing sunglasses and a fake mustache! Phoenix: (I knew it... The only question is, what was he doing here?) Card on floor (subsequent times) Phoenix: Um... Would you like me to pick up that key card? It's pretty important, isn't it? Man: No, that's all right. I'm waiting for that new maid over there to notice it. Phoenix: I-I see.

Talk The incident Nichody: About the incident Miss Ellen was arrested for... ...do you think she did it? Phoenix: Well, I can't prove it yet, but no, I don't think she could've done it. I guess you could call it a gut feeling. Nichody: ...... I see. I guess we have different opinions, then. Phoenix: Do we, now? Nichody: The prosecution says that when Gloomsbury attacked Miss Ellen, she fought back... ...and ended up killing him. I agree with this perspective. Or rather, that is the consensus of the entire Sprocket family. Phoenix: ...Even so, I heard an interesting story from Chief Prosecutor Edgeworth. I heard that the Sprocket family had tried to pressure the Prosecutor's Office... ...into burying this case. Nichody: I fear you are mistaken. All we sought was merely a legal consultation. Besides, none of it matters now, as she is no longer a part of this family. Fortunately for us, they had yet to get their marriage license before holding the banquet. Phoenix: (So basically, once they realized they couldn't sway the prosecution, they cut her loose...) Nichody: ......I realize how callous I must sound. But my duty is to protect the Sprocket family, and more specifically... ...Sprocket Aviation's future and Master Sorin, whose genius is essential to the company. I will do anything to achieve that goal. That is my job as the Sprocket family butler. Maya: You know, I think Pierce and Mr. Edgeworth would get along really well. Don't you think? Phoenix: Yeah. I could easily picture Edgeworth with a butler. Nichody: Oh, and by the way... I suppose I should tell you about this as well... It's about when the members of the extended family and I discovered the crime. Time travel Phoenix: Um, did Ellen say anything to you about traveling through time? Nichody: ...She must have been delirious. There is no need to take such a claim seriously. Phoenix: Sorin himself said that time travel was possible, though. Nichody: ! ......Master Sorin... said that? ......It sounds like he is still stuck in the past. Phoenix: (He's psychologically stuck, I take it...) *ring* *ring* Nichody: Excuse me. What is it? ............I see. I believe I told you the madam will be having milk tea. Still, have lemon slices at the ready, just in case. We must not disappoint her, understand? Phoenix: You sure are busy. Nichody: All in a day's work. ...Still, we really do need Master Sorin to start focusing on the business side of things soon. Phoenix: Um, could you tell us about that thing you mentioned about Sorin's past? Nichody: There is something in Master Sorin's past that he wishes he could change... Please forgive me. This isn't something I should be sharing with strangers. Phoenix: (Now I really want to know what Sorin's still hung up on...) Discovering the crime (appears after \"The incident\") Nichody: It was sometime after the reception. Some of the master's relatives and I went to clean up the reception hall... ...and that is when we saw it. A woman standing in front of the victim with the bloody murder weapon in her hand... It was none other than Miss Ellen. Phoenix: But, Pierce, it wasn't what it looked like! Maya: That's right! She just happened to find the body! Nichody: I do not know what Miss Ellen has told you, but what we witnessed... ... was unmistakably the moment immediately after the deed had been committed. Phoenix: Nngh... Nichody: And that is what I told the police who came in response to my call. Phoenix: I-I see... (So Pierce was the one who reported it to the police, huh?) Sorin's past (appears after presenting Selena Sprocket Photo) Nichody: Master Sorin will become the next president of Sprocket Aviation. However, that wasn't always so. Miss Selena Sprocket, Master Sorin's elder sister, was next in line. Maya: So why isn't she becoming the next president? Nichody: ......Because she died... in a car accident. Maya: What?! Phoenix: I-I had no idea...! Nichody: Actually, Master Sorin was also in the car with her at the time of the accident. Losing the sister he loved right before his eyes devastated him. Ever since then, he has buried himself in his research on time machines. He also became a quiet and meticulous -- almost compulsive -- note-taker around then. Maya: He seems so stiff and robotic -- I had no idea he was carrying all that around inside him... Nichody: Master Sorin has abandoned the company business and spends all his time on inventions. As the family butler, I am truly concerned. I believe it is high time he let go of the past. Present Ellen's Pendant or Time Keeper Nichody: Master Sorin made the Time Keeper as a symbol of their love for each other. ...A symbol now tainted with blood. I can only imagine how shocking this must be for Master Sorin. Phoenix: But surely Sorin believes in the woman he loves. Nichody: Master Sorin has the future of Sprocket Aviation to think about. He cannot afford to let his personal feelings affect his judgment. Phoenix: Th-That's awful! Nichody: You might think so, but that's the kind of responsibility he must bear. Phoenix: (All because he's in line to be the next president, huh? Sounds like it's not going to be easy to find out how Sorin really feels about anything...) Flying Chapel Pamphlet or Photo of Reception Nichody: This incident has severely damaged the company's reputation. I expect reservations for weddings on the Flying Chapel will face an unfortunate decline. Phoenix: Pierce, you just lost a subordinate... ...yet, all you can think about is the business? Nichody: I am not made of stone, I assure you. But if this company were to go under because of this incident... ...countless employees would lose their jobs. Phoenix: I-I see... Nichody: To be honest, I wish we could have hidden this tragedy from the public... ...but now that it's going to trial, I suppose there is nothing to be done about it. Phoenix: (So the fate of this company depends on this trial... This is more than I bargained for...) Photo of Victim or Gloomsbury's Note Nichody: Gloomsbury... How could he do something so deranged? It is truly a shame. As a servant, he was a cut above the rest. Phoenix: Mr. Gloomsbury worked under you, correct? Were there any signs that he was going to do anything like that to Ellen? Nichody: No, he gave no indication whatsoever. If only I'd realized what he was up to sooner... Phoenix: I-I see... Selena Sprocket Photo Phoenix: Pierce, the woman in this photo is Sorin's older sister Selena, right? I don't think we've met her yet. Nichody: Yes, about that... Phoenix: (He seems... hesitant, all of a sudden.) If you wouldn't mind... ...could you tell us about her? Nichody: A-All right. Very well. She's a big part of Master Sorin's past, after all... Phoenix: Sorin's... past? Anything else Nichody: And what is this? Phoenix: Just wondering if there is anything you can tell me about it. Nichody: Hmm... I'm afraid not. Phoenix: I-I see. Nichody: Time is money, as they say, so perhaps you should learn to spend it more wisely. Phoenix: R-Right. (Good advice, but his chilly attitude is giving me some serious goose bumps...) After clearing all Talk options and examining bouquet, film camera or photos on table, and card on floor: ???: Hey, Nick! What are you doing here? Phoenix: Larry? Larry: Oh, man! Edgey gave me a heckuva hard time! Phoenix: Larry, what are YOU doing here? Larry: I came to promote my new character, Cupiglet! I was hoping Sprocket Aviation would do some kind of tie-in with me for it! Maya: Wow. I didn't know Larry was such an aggressive businessman. You could learn a thing or two from him, Nick. Why don't you promote your agency to them? Phoenix: Now's not exactly the time for that, in case you haven't noticed. Maya: See? And this is why you'll never be rich! Phoenix: Actually, Larry, I've been meaning to ask you something. You were on the Flying Chapel yesterday, right? Larry: Huh? Was I...? Er... Phoenix: What were you doing there? Larry: N-Nothing... Phoenix: Whatever it was, I bet it wasn't anything to be proud of. But never mind that. Did you see anything that had to do with the case? ......Scratch that. Let's start with, you weren't INVOLVED in this case, were you? Larry: ! ............ Phoenix: Larry...? Maya: Hey! He took off! Phoenix: I just knew it... When something smells, it's usually the Butz... Come on, Maya! After him! Nichody: Oh, are you leaving so soon? Phoenix: We, uh, have to run... Thank you for making time for us. Nichody: I know you have to investigate, but please try to spare the family's feelings as you do. Phoenix: Y-Yes, of course. September 21Sprocket Park - Mooring Dock Phoenix: There he is. Hey, Larry! Larry: H-Hey, there, friend! Fancy meeting you here! Phoenix: There's nothing \"fancy\" about it. All we did was follow you. So, tell me, Larry. Why did you run away like that? Larry: Huh? Me? ...I don't know what you're talking about. A bolt of inspiration for my new picture book hit me and I had to run is all. It was, like, a \"Cupiphany!\" You dig? Phoenix: Riiiiight... Maya: He's just going to keep on playing dumb, isn't he, Nick? Talk What you saw on the airship Phoenix: Come on, Larry. I know you were on that airship, so what did you see? Larry: I-I didn't see anything! I didn't see anything 'cause I was never on that stupid airship! 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: ! Psyche-Locks... Larry: You say something? Phoenix: (The spiritual power of this magatama allows me to see... ...these mystical locks that appear when someone is trying to hide something from me. They're called \"Psyche-Locks,\" and when I see them... ...I simply present the magatama ([X / Y / R]) to try my hand at breaking them. (Changed from [...I simply touch the magatama (X) to try my hand at breaking them.] in the original release) If I can unlock them, I'm sure to finally get a straight answer out of him!) Present Magatama Phoenix: 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- What Larry Is Hiding -- Phoenix: This is no time for games, Larry. I WILL find out what you're hiding. Larry: I'm telling ya, Nick, you've got it all wrong. I've got nothing to do with this case, whatsoever! Phoenix: (Oh, come on, Larry! Even a baby could see through such a blatant and obvious lie.) \"Nothing whatsoever,\" huh? If you weren't involved, Larry, then you wouldn't have been involved with this person. Present Ellen Wyatt profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"You're the one who brought Ellen to my office in the first place.\" Present anyone else Phoenix: Larry: Huh? What are you trying to say, Nick? Phoenix: (Oops. Looks like I got it wrong.) J-Just ignore I said that! Larry: Jeez. Get a grip, will ya? Leads back to: \"If you weren't involved, Larry, then you wouldn't have been involved with this person.\" Phoenix: You're the one who brought Ellen to my office in the first place. ...And all those cops. Larry: Um... Phoenix: \"Nothing to do with the case, whatsoever\" isn't gonna cut it this time, Larry! If you have to lie, at least do a better job of it! Larry: U... UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! 1 LOCK BROKEN Larry: D-Don't diss me, Nick! If you're so convinced I'm lying, then lemme ask you this! What makes you think I was on that stupid ol' airship, anyway?! Lemme see some proof! If you've got any! Phoenix: Doubling down, are you? Fine. You want proof, Larry? Here's proof that you were on that airship! Present Business Card Wallet Phoenix: Leads to: \"Uh-oh!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Larry: You call that proof? Hmph. Phoenix: (Argh! I must've gotten it wrong!) Larry: Seriously, Nick. You shouldn't doubt your friends like this. It only hurts the both of us. Phoenix: (I'd better try that again.) Leads back to: \"You want proof, Larry? Here's proof that you were on that airship!\" Larry: Uh-oh! Phoenix: This is your business card wallet, isn't it, Larry? I found it in the reception hall. Larry: Gah! Phoenix: Time to come clean, Larry Butz. What exactly are you hiding? Larry: W-WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! ...... A-All right! Fine! Ya got me! I'll tell you everything! 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful What you saw on the airship (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Phoenix: Larry, what were you doing on that airship, anyway? Larry: Well, I went there to deliver the \"Welcome to Our Wedding\" sign they ordered from me. Phoenix: Huh. I didn't know you took on real jobs like that, too. Larry: Well, for your information, my wedding welcome signs are very popular on the Net! Phoenix: And that's how you met Ellen? Larry: Uh-huh. I mean, I'd seen her in the photo for the welcome sign, but seeing her in person... The way she smiled at me and said, \"Thank you\"... *sigh* I felt like I'd been hit by lightning! Phoenix: And that's when you fell in love with somebody else's bride, huh? So, were you invited to the reception? Larry: Can you believe they told me only family and relatives could attend?! They wouldn't even let me into the reception hall! Phoenix: (Smart move on their part, I'd say.) Larry: I got upset, and started wandering around the airship. That must be when I dropped my business card wallet. Phoenix: (So somebody else must've found it... ...and brought it to the reception hall, then.) Larry: But you know what? I saw something incredible while I was on that Flying Chapel! Phoenix: Like...? Larry: Get a load of this! Phoenix: Wh-What the heck is this? Larry: Whaddaya mean, \"what is this\"? Isn't it obvious? It's a drawing! I sketched a picture of one of the cabins on the airship. Phoenix: So what's so incredible about a cabin? Larry: Look at what was outside the window! It's one of those flying dinosaurs -- a real live pterodactyl! I looked out the cabin window and there it was, just flying out there! That airship traveled through time, I tell you! Phoenix: Wh-Wh... Maya: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Larry: When I told that Pierce butler guy about it... ...he told me to never mention it to anybody ever again. Phoenix: But why would he try to keep you from spouting what is clearly just nonsense? Larry: Maybe Sprocket Aviation is secretly developing a time machine! Phoenix: ......N-No way... Maya: N-Nick, this case is... ...totally amazing! Larry! You didn't tell Mr. Edgeworth about this, did you? Larry: Of course not! Edgey would just roll his eyes and think I was off my rocker. I didn't even tell him I was wandering around on the airship. I told him I met Elly at the mooring dock and we ran away together. Phoenix: Yeah... I can see Edgeworth's eyes rolling right out of his head had he heard about this. Larry's Drawing added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (So Larry also experienced the time slip somehow... But how is that possible...?) Larry: Hey, Nick. I'll be taking my card wallet back now, if you don't mind. Business Card Wallet swiped back by Larry. Larry: Oh, yeah. This is for you. Phoenix: What is it? Larry: It's a picture of the hold. I took it when I was wandering around on the airship. See? There's Elly right there in the middle. Phoenix: Um, the hold? Larry: Yeah, see? It's right here on the diagram. Phoenix: Okay. So now I know where the hold is. But what was Ellen doing there? Larry: Well, they were using it as a prepping area for the reception. Phoenix: I see. And around when did you take this? Larry: Before the reception. I took it while Elly was getting everything ready. Phoenix: So this was taken before the incident occurred... I don't know if it'll be of any help, but thanks for this anyway. Photo of Hold added to the Court Record. Phoenix: By the way, Larry. I heard that the door to the hold is controlled by a security system. So how'd you get in there? Larry: Th-That's...! A trade secret! Can't tell ya! Phoenix: (And the hits just keep on coming...) Well, I guess that's basically a wrap on the investigation. Maya: Not quite, Nick! I want to meet Ellen, too! Phoenix: Oh, that's right. You haven't met her yet, have you? Okay. Let's head over to the detention center, so you can say hi. What you saw on the airship (subsequent times) Phoenix: Larry, what were you doing on that airship, anyway? Larry: Well, I went there to deliver the \"Welcome to Our Wedding\" sign they ordered from me. Phoenix: Huh. I didn't know you took on real jobs like that, too. Larry: Well, for your information, my wedding welcome signs are very popular on the Net! Phoenix: And that's how you met Ellen? Larry: Uh-huh. I mean, I'd seen her in the photo for the welcome sign, but seeing her in person... The way she smiled at me and said, \"Thank you\"... *sigh* I felt like I'd been hit by lightning!

I didn't even tell him I was wandering around on the airship. I told him I met Elly at the mooring dock and we ran away together. Phoenix: Yeah... I can see Edgeworth's eyes rolling right out of his head had he heard about this. Present Business Card Wallet Phoenix: I found this in the reception hall. Larry: ........... Say, that's a pretty stylish wallet, ain't it? Phoenix: Have you ever seen it before? Larry: ............Nope. Phoenix: (I'll take that as a \"yes\"... Which means he must be trying to hide something from me.) Larry: I-I don't know anything about that wallet! Phoenix: (I'll just have to take him to task later...) Selena Sprocket Photo Larry: Whoooooooa! Who is she? Who is this lovely vision? Phoenix: Larry... *sigh* This is Sorin's older sister. She died in a car accident. Larry: Nooooooooo! How could such a beautiful flame have been snuffed out like that?! If she were alive today, I bet I could've made her happy. Phoenix: That's funny. I thought you were in love with Ellen? Larry: Don't get me wrong, Nick. I just wanna make all the pretty ladies of this world happy, that's all! Phoenix: I-I think you're the one getting it wrong... Anything else (before breaking Psyche-Locks) Larry: Hm? Do you really think you can prove Elly's innocence with that? Phoenix: If I knew, I wouldn't need to conduct an investigation, now would I? Now, look at the evidence, Larry! Can you tell me anything about it? Larry: Hmm.... Hmmmmmmmmmmm... Hmm... Nope. Sorry! Can't think of a thing. Phoenix: (Good thing I had low expectations from the start then...) Business Card Wallet (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Larry: All right, I admit it! That super stylish business card wallet is mine! What more do you want outta me?! ...Wait. Don't tell me you were hoping to keep it for yourself? Phoenix: Why would I want a card wallet with your face on it?! Larry: Aww, don't be shy! Tell you what, Nick. I'll have one sent to your office. I'll even throw in a \"good friend discount\" on it, too. Phoenix: I'd still have to pay?! (Trucy's going to take it out of my hide, too, once she sees that in the expenses book.) Larry's Drawing Larry: Hey! That's the drawing I made. You'd better take care of it. I bet it's gonna be valuable some day! Oh, do you want me to add a character or something to it? Maya: Ooh, could you? I'd love to see a true artist at work! Phoenix: Hold it! As farcical as this drawing is, there will be no doodling on the evidence until the trial is over. Larry: Wh-Whaddaya mean, \"farcical\"?! I'm never gonna draw anything for you ever again! Not even if you beg me! Maya: Aww... Guess that's that, huh, Nick? Phoenix: (Need I remind you that it's still a piece of evidence, Maya...?) Anything else (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Larry: What are you showing me that for? Is this an interrogation? Okay, sure, I snuck onto that airship and was wandering around it all by my lonesome. But you gotta believe me! I didn't kill anybody! Phoenix: And WHY were you sneaking around on that airship in the first place? Larry: Because... it was fate...? Yeah, that's it! I was just following my destiny! That's all I've ever done! Phoenix: (Oh, come on, Larry... Are you seriously going to blame all the trouble you've ever caused on fate?) Wright Anything Agency, Reception Hall, or Foyer Talk Any ideas? Phoenix: The internal affairs of a powerful and wealthy family... I get the feeling this is going to get messy. What are your thoughts, Maya? Maya: Hmm... Prestigious families like this tend to try and protect their reputation, don't they? Phoenix: Yeah. That's the thing. Maya: But at least YOU don't have much of a reputation to protect. That means you can do anything you want to win this case! Phoenix: Who says I don't have a reputation to protect?! What to do Phoenix: I still can't help but wonder... You know this time travel thing Ellen keeps talking about... Do you think it really happened? Maya: Oh, I believe it happened! Phoenix: Y-You do?! Based on what? Maya: Well, it's not really based on anything, exactly... It's just that it's so much more fun to believe that it really happened! As soon as this case is over, I'm going to go talk with Sorin Sprocket myself. I'm going to ask him to send me back to medieval times! Phoenix: W-Well, I guess it's nice to have a dream... (Just please don't let the fantasy of time travel turn real in this case...) Present Larry's Drawing Maya: Larry's a really good artist, isn't he? No wonder he's a famous picture book author! Phoenix: Well, he's really good at something all right. Namely, at causing trouble wherever he goes. Maya: But he's also helped you out of a bind or two before, right? Phoenix: I guess so... (But that's not usually until after he's made a mess of things first...) After clearing \"What you saw on the airship\" Talk option in Sprocket Park - Mooring Dock: September 21Detention Center - Visitor's Room Ellen: No! Why?! ???: Please understand that this is in Master Sorin's best interest. Phoenix: (Sounds like Ellen's busy talking with someone...) Nichody: The next president cannot be married to a criminal. It would disgrace Sprocket Aviation. Miss Ellen, I need you to forget about this marriage. Phoenix: Pardon us... Nichody: ! ...If it isn't Mr. Wright. Phoenix: So... their marriage is definitely off? Nichody: There is no other choice. We cannot have a criminal in the family. For the sake of Master Sorin and the Sprocket family, this is what is best. Ellen: *sniffle* Nooooo... Maya: ... Um... in that case... ...what if Nick here proved Ellen's innocence? Then you wouldn't have a criminal in the family, right?! Nichody: ! ......I-I suppose you are right, but I am afraid that will be impossible. Maya: That's not true! Not for Nick. He may look like a nobody, but he can do some pretty amazing things! Phoenix: ......I don't take cases on lightly, so rest assured, I will prove her innocence. Nichody: Mr. Phoenix Wright... I understand your name is quite well-known in the judicial world... For better or for worse. Phoenix: ...Pierce, I want you to promise me this: If I can prove Ellen's innocence... ...then you won't stand in the way of Sorin and Ellen's marriage. Nichody: ......Hmph. Very well. But not even the most talented lawyer in the world can change reality itself. And the reality is, Miss Ellen is guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt. Phoenix: I believe that's where you're wrong, Pierce. Ellen: I'm clean! I swear I am! Obsessively, compulsively, clean! Just as clean and pure as this pure-white dress! Nichody: ...Fine. You have my word. But you will be the one to regret this promise. ......Now, if you will excuse me. Phoenix: (...Now I have all the more reason to win this case.) Ellen, we finished our investigation, and we'd like to talk with you about what we found. Ellen: Okay! So what did you find out? Talk Investigation results Phoenix: In the course of our investigation, we heard that... ...you had been standing in front of the victim with the murder weapon in your hands. Ellen: ! I-It wasn't what it looked like! It's true I was holding the murder weapon... ...but when I found him, he was already dead. I-I panicked... ...and I was hoping I could go back in time again, like I had done earlier. So I picked up the Time Keeper from the pedestal and brought it over without thinking. Phoenix: You were so desperate, you were ready to try anything, huh... Unfortunately, that sort of behavior makes you an easy target for the prosecution. Ellen: No... Phoenix: And as for your little trip through time... ...none of your in-laws could confirm your story, I'm afraid. Ellen: I... I see... Phoenix: The only exception is Larry. He said he saw something. Ellen: Really? Wh-What did he see? Time travel (appears after \"Investigation results\") Leads to: \"Can't say I quite believe it myself, but Larry claims he saw something incredible.\" Present Ellen's Pendant, Flying Chapel Pamphlet, Broken Lantern, Time Keeper, or Photo of Reception Ellen: Ooooooh... Phoenix: Wh-What's wrong? Ellen: I just remembered our reception... We were supposed to be so happy together! Oh, where did it all go wrong...? Phoenix: (I can't blame her for being upset.) Ellen: Why did this have to happen to me? UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Phoenix: E-Ellen! Please try to calm down! Okay?! Ellen: A-All right... Phoenix: (Well, she stopped crying, but... ...how can I ask her about anything when she's still so clearly distraught?) Photo of Victim Ellen: *gulp* Phoenix: A-Are you all right? Ellen: I-I... don't feel very well... Maya: Nick! That photo is a bit much for most normal people, you know! Phoenix: Y-Yeah, I guess you're right. (Oops, that was pretty inconsiderate of me...) Gloomsbury's Note Phoenix: Ellen, can you tell if this is Mr. Gloomsbury's handwriting? Ellen: No. I'm sorry. I'm not very familiar with his handwriting. Phoenix: I see... (And unless the handwriting is very distinct, I know it's often hard to tell.) Ellen: I-I'm sorry, but I'm not very comfortable with looking at a note which details... ...a plan on how to murder me written on it... Phoenix: Oh, sorry... I guess that should go without saying... Selena Sprocket Photo Ellen: *sniffle* Oh, poor Selena... I feel so sad about what happened to her...! SELENAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! Phoenix: Yikes! Ellen, please try to calm down! Pretty please? With sugar on top? Ellen: Sorin and I were supposed to be happy -- for Selena's sake, too. WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Maya: We... should probably leave this topic alone, Nick... Phoenix: Can't say I quite believe it myself, but Larry claims he saw something incredible. He claims he saw a pterodactyl flying outside the airship. Ellen: Wh... WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Phoenix: Not only that, but apparently Pierce Nichody told Larry to keep quiet about it. Ellen: But why would Pierce do such a thing? Maya: Larry's theory is that Sprocket Aviation is developing something in secret. A time machine, to be exact. Ellen: Do you think... Do you think that's why nobody would confirm my story? Because it's a secret? Phoenix: I-I really don't know. But speaking of your in-laws... ...we did manage to find your key card at Sprocket Manor. One of your in-laws said he'd keep an eye on it for you. Ellen: Oh, thank goodness! I lost it while I was getting things ready for the reception. I'd looked everywhere for it! I'm so glad you found iiiiiit! Phoenix: (A-At least they're tears of joy this time, for a change...) Maya: Well, Nick... It looks like you'll have to prove the existence of time travel in court tomorrow! Ellen: That's right! I swear that while Mr. Gloomsbury was being killed... ...I was busy traveling back through time! Phoenix: Great. With stodgy, skeptic Edgeworth at the helm for the prosecution tomorrow... ...we're really gonna have our work cut out for us. *sigh* To be continued Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: Nothing particularly interesting here. Area already examined Phoenix: (We've already searched here, but it never hurts to take another look around.) Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I think I'd better take a step back and gather my thoughts a little more...) Turnabout Time Traveler Image Gallery Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 September 22, 8:45 AMDistrict Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Ellen: Good morning, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Good morning, Ellen. I see you're still wearing your wedding gown. Ellen: And I will continue to wear it until our marriage is saved! ......... Oh! S-Sorin! Sorin: ............. Maya: Do you think he came to see how she's holding up? Ellen: Sorin, my love! You came all the way to the courthouse just to see me? Oh, Sorin! I don't know what to say! Sorin: ......Blueprints. Ellen: Huh? Sorin: The engine blueprints... I can't find them. Do you know where they are? Ellen: Oh! They're in your room, third shelf from the bottom, on the right-hand side. Sorin: ......Ah. I see. Phoenix: He's leaving already...? Maya: Don't tell me he came just to ask about some stupid blueprints? Is he really that cold of a person, or is that just how he comes off, I wonder... Ellen: *sniffle* Wh-What about me, Sorin...? Sorin: ......Ellen. Phoenix: (He's back.) Sorin: ............ ...Come home soon. ......I'm... lost without you. Ellen: ............S-S-S-Soriiiiiiiiiiiiin! Sorin: Later... Maya: Looks like showing your vulnerabilities is the fastest way to capturing a woman's heart. You should take notes on this, Nick. Phoenix: Please leave me out of this. (Anyway, it looks like Sorin isn't big on words... ...but it's clear that he cares about Ellen. Knowing that, I actually feel kind of relieved.) Ellen: Mr. Wright! I just absolutely CAN'T be found guilty, you hear! Phoenix: Don't worry. I'm going to do everything I can to prove your innocence. Ellen: THANK you, Mr. Wright! Bailiff: The trial is about to start, sir. Phoenix: (.........Edgeworth. Knowing him, he's not going to yield an inch. So I've just got to fight with everything I've got and save Ellen!) September 22, 9:00 AMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 6 Day 1Court Is Now In SessionAll Rise Judge: Court is now in session for the trial of Ellen Wyatt. Phoenix: The defense is ready, Your Honor. Edgeworth: The prosecution has been ready for a while, Your Honor. Judge: Seeing so many familiar faces gathered together like this... I feel as though I'm at a grand reunion. It makes me want to go out for dinner and a drink, and reminisce with all of you. Maya: Oh! That sounds like a great idea! I was dying for a real burger the whole time I was away! Phoenix: We could make it a welcome back party for Maya. How about it, Edgeworth? Edgeworth: .........I have no intention of cavorting with my enemies. Now then, Your Honor, let us start this trial at once. Judge: Ho ho. Still not one for lighthearted banter, are you, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Hmph. Jokes and good humor are beyond worthless in a court of law. Maya: Guess we'll just have to have the party without him, then. Edgeworth: ............ However, were it after the conclusion of this trial... ...I might consider joining you for your little welcome back party. I certainly wouldn't mind an invite, at the very least. Maya: ...He's still as emotionally constipated as ever, I see. Judge: Now then, Mr. Edgeworth, if you could please go over the details of this case for us. Edgeworth: The victim was Dumas Gloomsbury, a servant in the Sprocket household. He was in attendance at the wedding reception that occurred from 7 PM to 10 PM. Mr. Gloomsbury apparently felt some animosity toward Ellen Wyatt, and so... ...a bit after the reception ended at 10 PM, he assaulted Ms. Wyatt with the intent to kill her. The defendant fought back, and ended up killing Mr. Gloomsbury. Judge: Hmm... In other words... it was justified self-defense, correct? If that's the case, then the defendant might not be criminally responsible. Phoenix: (He's right... Worst-case scenario, I could go for self-defense to avoid the criminal charge. I wonder how Edgeworth plans to counter that, though...?) Edgeworth: ...The prosecution's first witness will make my view on the matter clear, Your Honor. Judge: Very well. Bailiff, please bring in the first witness. Edgeworth: Please state your name and occupation, witness. Ema: Ema Skye. Forensic investigator. A-And I'd just like to say, sir...! That being in the same courtroom as you is a great honor! Edgeworth: ......Hm? Phoenix: Oh, that's right... You're a fan of Edgeworth's, aren't you, Ema? Ema: We're good friends and all, Mr. Wright... ...but, just this once, I intend to faithfully and fully testify for the prosecution! And I do mean that wholeheartedly! Edgeworth: Heh. I expect no less from you. Ema: Yes, sir! I'm going to do my very best! Maya: Looks like you lost the popularity contest to Mr. Edgeworth, Nick. Phoenix: ...Meh, I really could care less. Besides... ...she'll see who's the better lawyer once I win this trial. Maya: Yeah... Maybe then you'll actually really care less. Judge: Now, Detective Skye, if you please. Witness Testimony -- Rundown of the Case -- Ema: The murder weapon was a clock called the \"Time Keeper.\" The victim was hit with it from behind, and he fell over, right into the lantern. The defendant was spotted then, standing in front of the body holding the murder weapon. The victim was struck twice, by the way. Phoenix: He was struck twice? Ema: That's right. There's no mistake about it. The first blow was to the back of the victim's head. It was hard enough to knock him unconscious. Yet, despite the fact that he had been immobilized by the first blow... ...the defendant delivered a second, fatal blow to the side of the victim's head. Phoenix: ...Which means... what, exactly? Edgeworth: Hmph. I figured it would go right over your head. Let's put it this way: By striking the victim a second time... ...the defendant killed her last chance to escape from any criminal wrongdoing. Judge: She did? But how, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: The defendant may have been fighting back because she was being attacked. However... ...she then went on to deliver a fatal blow to a man who was already fully unconscious. Maya: N-Nick, is he saying what I think he is...? Phoenix: I don't feel so well... Edgeworth: And thus, Mr. Wright, has justified self-defense been removed from the table. The prosecution intends to prove that the defendant killed the victim... ...with murderous intent. Allow me to, belatedly, submit the victim's autopsy report. Phoenix: ......A... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRNNGH! (So THAT'S why he was acting all smug...! Well, more smug than usual...) Maya: I-It's fine, right? It's not like we were going to plead self-defense anyway, right? Phoenix: Right, but... now the judge has a negative impression of Ellen. Judge: ............ Edgeworth: Hmph. Phoenix: (He may not get to prosecute much anymore, but he definitely hasn't lost his touch.) Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Judge: Now, then, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination. Cross Examination -- Rundown of the Case -- Ema: The murder weapon was a clock called the \"Time Keeper.\" Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you completely sure the murder weapon was the Time Keeper? Ema: Yes, completely. The shape of the injury on the victim's head matches up with that of the Time Keeper. And it's definitely heavy enough to kill someone with. Phoenix: But would the defendant have been able to pick up and swing something so heavy? Ema: I tried it myself, and I was able to lift it up just fine. Phoenix: Maybe you're just freakishly strong...? Ema: Excuse me, Mr. Wright?! I'll have you know that people on the force know me as the dainty forensic investigator! Phoenix: S-Sorry... (...But really, you're hardly a delicate flower.) Edgeworth: ...Mr. Wright. This is a court of law. Save your antics for after the trial, if you know how. Phoenix: Yes, sir... It won't happen again, sir... Ema: Hmph! ...Moving on! Ema: The victim was hit with it from behind, and he fell over, right into the lantern. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The defendant was fighting back against the victim, right? If so, wouldn't she have hit him from the front and not from behind? Ema: The victim must've tried to run once Ms. Wyatt started fighting back. That's probably when he got hit from behind. Phoenix: I see... Thus, the blow to the back of his head. Ema: The defendant must've looked awfully scary when she was brandishing that clock. Phoenix: I don't know about that... (Regardless of how scary Ellen looked, the victim was definitely hit from behind...) Ema: ...May I go on? Phoenix: Yes, of course. Please do. Present Photo of Victim Phoenix: Leads to: \"Detective Skye, I'm afraid I have to apologize in advance.\" Ema: The defendant was spotted then, standing in front of the body holding the murder weapon. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: B-But that's only because she was so panicked when she found the body... ...that she tried to use the Time Keeper to go back in time. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Mr. Wright... Do you have any idea how absurd you sound? Phoenix: B-But Ms. Wyatt really believed she could travel through time with that clock! Edgeworth: You really should've come up with a more credible story, you know. Judge: Yes, I agree. Phoenix: (Me, three... But it's all I have to go on...) Ema: ...Anyway, under the circumstances... ...the only conclusion we can draw is that the defendant killed the victim. Ema: The victim was struck twice, by the way. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Ms. Wyatt must've had a chance to escape after she struck the victim the first time. So why would she stick around and hit him with such a heavy object again? Ema: Well, about that... Edgeworth: Allow me to explain. Why did she strike him again, indeed? To finish off the victim, of course. This very act clearly shows that she had every intention of killing Mr. Gloomsbury! Phoenix: Urk! Maya: But Ms. Wyatt would never do a thing like that! Edgeworth: Then let's see some evidence that disproves my theory! Maya: Nnrrgh...! Are you going to just stand there and take that from him, Nick?! Phoenix: (I can't refute his claim head-on, so I'll have to approach it from a different angle.) Phoenix: Well... ...it looks like we won't be going anywhere until we can refute Edgeworth's claim. Maya: This is so exciting! We haven't taken on Mr. Edgeworth in ages! Phoenix: Y-Yeah... Maya: Okay, Nick! Now, go get him! Phoenix: No need to rush me, Maya... (All right. I'd better start by comparing Ema's testimony with the evidence we have... ...and look for any glaring inconsistencies!) Phoenix: Detective Skye, I'm afraid I have to apologize in advance. Ema: For what? Phoenix: For embarrassing you in front of your idol. Ema: Wh-What do you mean? Phoenix: If you take a look at this photo of the crime scene... ...you'll see that the victim is lying on his back. But if the victim had been hit from behind as you claim... ...then he should have fallen over into the lantern facedown. Ema: Aaaaah! Phoenix: It's not enough to simply take someone's side, Detective Skye. Even if it's Mr. Edgeworth's. Ema: Ah...! Oooh... Judge: Hmm... There does appear to be a flaw in Detective Skye's testimony. Ema: Ema: Mr. Wright! If you think I'm going to just back right down, then you're sadly mistaken! Phoenix: (Ema is unusually fired up today...) Maya: Don't forget, she's in front of her hero, Nick. If the Steel Samurai came to watch this trial, I'd want to do my absolute best, too. Ema: Listen, Mr. Wright. It's entirely possible that the defendant moved the victim's body after he fell over. In that case, there wouldn't be any contradiction, right? Edgeworth: Indeed. That was an excellent counterargument, Detective. Ema: You can count on me, sir! So, what do you have to say to that, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Is it possible that the victim's body was moved after he fell into the lantern? It's possible Phoenix: The defense believes... it's possible that the victim's body was moved by the defendant! Maya: Wh-What are you doing, Nick?! You're backing up Ema's claim?! Phoenix: ......Oops! I meant to answer in the negative! Judge: In other words, you wish to claim the exact opposite of what you just said? A reversal that dramatic... ...deserves an equally dramatic punishment. Phoenix: There's no need to be such a drama queen about it, Your Honor... (Well, I guess this leaves me with just one answer. I can't mess this up now!) Leads back to: \"Is it possible that the victim's body was moved after he fell into the lantern?\" It's not possible Leads to: \"Sorry, Detective, but there's no way the victim's body was moved after his death.\" Phoenix: Sorry, Detective, but there's no way the victim's body was moved after his death. Ema: Oh, really? And what makes you so sure? Phoenix: One look at this here, and it should become obvious. Present rubble on top of body Phoenix: Leads to: \"Th-Those broken bits of the lantern?\" Present anywhere else Phoenix: Ema: Um... What exactly are you pointing at, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Oh... uh... This right here? Judge: Hmm... What you're trying to communicate is not obvious at all, Mr. Wright. But this penalty should make my feelings on the matter pretty obvious -- even to you. Phoenix: (The only thing that's obvious right now is the pain in my attorney's badge.) Leads back to: \"One look at this here, and it should become obvious.\" Ema: Th-Those broken bits of the lantern? Phoenix: Yes. If the body had been moved after the fact, these fragments would've fallen off of it. But, as you can clearly see, they're lying perfectly undisturbed on top of the body. This means that the victim must've been lying face up from before the lantern even broke. Ema: .......You're right! Maya: But wait a minute. If that's true... ...then when was the victim killed? I mean, the lantern was still whole during the reception, right? Phoenix: Right. Which means we've just overturned a major assumption about this case. If the victim was already dead before the lantern was even broken... ...then the body must've been inside the lantern since before the reception started. In other words... ...the defense asserts that the victim was killed before the wedding reception! Judge: WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Phoenix: In short... ...when Ms. Wyatt was seen standing in front of the body after the reception... ...it wasn't the moment just after the murder was committed. It was the moment she happened to discover the body -- just as Ms. Wyatt claims! Ema: AAAAAAAAAAH! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hmph. Whether the act was committed before or after the reception is entirely inconsequential. After all, it was the defendant who prepared the reception hall for the event in question. Therefore, when the murder occurred changes nothing with regard to her guilt. She could have killed the victim before the reception, as you claim... ...and then tried to hide his body in the lantern after the event ended! Phoenix: Phoenix: Sorry, but that doesn't make any sense. I mean, where would the body have been hidden during the reception in your scenario? Edgeworth: Urngh... Th-That's...! Phoenix: Even you have to admit, Mr. Edgeworth, that this has opened up a new possibility. Edgeworth: Do explain, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Well, if Ms. Wyatt didn't commit the crime in the reception hall... ...then that means someone, somewhere put the victim's body into the lantern. Judge: Hmm... I suppose that makes sense. A dead body couldn't have put itself in there. Phoenix: Exactly, Your Honor. In other words... If the murder actually occurred before the reception, it opens up the possibility that... He was killed somewhere else Leads to: \"If the body was hidden inside the lantern...\" The defendant didn't do it Phoenix: The defendant didn't commit this murder! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Oh, for heaven's sake. Even if the murder was committed before the reception... ...that alone doesn't erase the suspicion against the defendant! Judge: It seems that was too ridiculous of a leap backwards for Mr. Edgeworth, Mr. Wright. I suggest you look before you leap, and think before you speak. Phoenix: (I guess I got ahead of myself on that one...) Leads back to: \"If the murder actually occurred before the reception, it opens up the possibility that...\" He was killed some other way Phoenix: The victim was killed some other way! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What does the victim's time of death have anything to do with how he was killed? I suggest you read the autopsy report again, Mr. Wright. Especially the part that states that the victim was clubbed to death with the Time Keeper! Phoenix: It was worth a try... Judge: You should know better than to just say the first shocking thing that comes to mind. Phoenix: (I've got this. I just have to stay cool and answer rationally.) Leads back to: \"If the murder actually occurred before the reception, it opens up the possibility that...\" Phoenix: If the body was hidden inside the lantern... ...then, it's possible that the body was moved along with it from somewhere else. Maya: Oh! You're right! Edgeworth: You can run that mouth of yours all you want... ...but do you have any evidence to support what's coming out of it, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Of course I do. (I think the answer lies in that piece of evidence -- and in something... ...that was left at the crime scene that will point us to where the victim was really killed!) Judge: Very well, Mr. Wright. In that case... What proves that the lantern and the body were moved from somewhere else? Present Photo of Victim Phoenix: Leads to: \"The photo of the victim again...?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This proves that the murder took place somewhere other than the reception hall! Judge: Hmm... I'm afraid I can't say that I follow. Maya: That piece of evidence won't help you make your point, Nick! Judge: Yet another pointless piece of evidence from a senseless attorney. Phoenix: (Fine, so this piece wasn't convincing enough. Then there must be something else that would be easier for the judge to understand!) Leads back to: \"What proves that the lantern and the body were moved from somewhere else?\" Ema: The photo of the victim again...? Phoenix: Yes. I'd like the court to focus on this thing, right here! Present flower petals Phoenix: Leads to: \"Flower petals, Mr. Wright?\" Present anywhere else Phoenix: Judge: Hmm... I'm afraid I don't get it at all. What exactly are we looking at here, Mr. Wright? Edgeworth: Hmph. That far-off look in his eyes suggests that his mind is equally as far-off in La-La Land. Judge: The defense will focus on the trial, if that's not too much to ask. Phoenix: (Well, that brought me back to reality fast.) Leads back to: \"I'd like the court to focus on this thing, right here!\" Ema: Flower petals, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: These petals are from a kind of flower that were not present in the reception hall. This means they must've gotten into the lantern when it was somewhere else. Edgeworth: And just where do you propose this \"somewhere else\" to be, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: I propose that this piece of evidence will tell us where the flower petals came from. Present Photo of Hold Phoenix: Leads to: \"Please take a look at the flowers in this picture of the hold.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: One look at this, and you'll see exactly where the petals came from! Judge: ............ Are you sure about that, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: I am, Your Honor! Judge: Because I'm afraid I can't see how. Phoenix: Even if you take a really good look? Judge: Unfortunately not. Phoenix: What if you... smelled the evidence? Judge: Still nothing. Phoenix: Huh. That's odd. Aha ha ha ha... Judge: This is no laughing matter, defense! I hope this will teach you to take matters seriously! Edgeworth: I suggest you refrain from embarrassing yourself any further with such stale jokes. Phoenix: I'll make sure to whip up a fresh batch for next time, then... A-All joking aside... (Even though I was actually being serious...) Leads back to: \"I propose that this piece of evidence will tell us where the flower petals came from.\" Phoenix: Please take a look at the flowers in this picture of the hold. Notice how their petals are of the same shape as the petals in the crime scene photo? Judge: Hmm, yes. I see. They do look to be from the same kind of flower. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hmph. Is that really all you've got? A flower is a flower is a flower. They're all the same. I would hardly call what you presented \"compelling evidence.\" Judge: I'm afraid I couldn't disagree with you more, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Hm? Judge: I gave a flower of this type to my lovely wife once when we were young. So I can assure you that this is very meaningful and compelling evidence indeed. The soundness of my judgment in this matter is backed by nothing less than pure love! Edgeworth: B-But, Your Honor... Phoenix: Let it go, Mr. Edgeworth. It's clear you don't know much about flowers. It's not like you have anyone you'd actually give any to, after all. But maybe you should study up on them, just in case the opportunity presents itself. Edgeworth: Nngoooh! This is from the man who only knows the names of three types of flowers! Phoenix: Th-That's hardly relevant to the case at hand! The defense asserts that it's highly probable that the victim was killed in the hold! If the body was then placed in the lantern and moved to the reception hall for some reason... ...it would completely destroy the prosecution's case! Maya: Then you mean, the body was...? Phoenix: Yes. The victim's body was... ...inside the lantern during the entire beautiful wedding reception! While the defendant and her betrothed were celebrating their love! Judge: WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hmph. Your smooth talk might work on His Honor, but it won't work on me. Phoenix: What are you talking about now? Edgeworth: Take another look at all of the evidence and you'll soon see what I mean. Phoenix: ............ (I wish he would just tell me already...) Edgeworth: Detective Skye, I'm sure you've already figured out what I'm talking about, correct? Ema: Heh heh heh. Of course, sir! Mr. Wright is the only one here who hasn't. Why don't you leave this to me, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Very well. Let's see what you can do. Judge: Detective Skye, please give your testimony to this court. Witness Testimony -- The Prosecution's Rebuttal -- Ema: The victim could not have been killed before the reception. The autopsy report states that the estimated time of death was after the reception. And that estimated time of death is correct. There's no way it could be wrong. Ema: It's clear Mr. Gloomsbury was killed after the reception. And that completely contradicts your claim! Phoenix: Hmm......... I guess so. Edgeworth: Tell me you took at least a cursory glance at the autopsy report, Mr. Wright. It appears you've grown rusty since our last outing. Might I suggest you go back and brush up on the basics? Phoenix: ......Sure. Though I must say, you're as cocky as ever, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: I beg your pardon? Ema: Wh-What are you trying to say, Mr. Wright?! Phoenix: I'm just saying that I'll go back to basics, if that's what Mr. Edgeworth wants. I'll prove how badly he's underestimating me with a good old-fashioned cross-examination. Edgeworth: ............... Judge: Very well. Let's see you put your money where your mouth is, Mr. Wright. Cross Examination -- The Prosecution's Rebuttal -- Ema: The victim could not have been killed before the reception. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You sound pretty certain. You must have some solid grounds for making that claim, right? Ema: Of course I do. And you're gonna feel silly when I show you what they are. Ready? Feast your eyes on this! Ema: The autopsy report states that the estimated time of death was after the reception. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: I've read the autopsy report, too, you know. Ema: Then you don't need me to explain it to you, right? How there's no way the victim could've been killed before the reception, I mean. Phoenix: Detective Skye... ...I think you've overlooked something big. Ema: I have?! Phoenix: Why don't you take another look at the evidence? Ema: ...But I've already looked at all the evidence! And quite carefully, too, I'll have you know! Edgeworth: Detective Skye. Do not be taken in by his verbal antics. He is simply bluffing, as always. Ema: R-Right, sir! Ema: And that estimated time of death is correct. There's no way it could be wrong. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Is it possible that the culprit did something to obscure the real time of death? Ema: No, not in this case. There was no snow or anything to keep the body from decomposing. And there's no fridge on that airship big enough to fit a body into. Phoenix: So you've already checked into that, I see... Maya: It all comes down to the estimated time of death, doesn't it? Couldn't the killer mess with the victim's time of death by keeping the body on ice? Phoenix: Yeah, if they had the means to. Present Fog Machine Phoenix: Leads to: \"I admit that the estimated time of death does contradict my theory.\" Phoenix: The prosecution is treating the estimated time of death as an absolute. But is it really? Maya: I take it you don't think it is, huh, Nick? In that case, we're going to have to find a way to convince them otherwise! Phoenix: Yeah, there's gotta be a way somehow... Phoenix: I admit that the estimated time of death does contradict my theory. Ema: Finally! And that means your theory that the victim was killed before the reception... Phoenix: ...Is still entirely plausible! Ema: Huh? Wh-What makes you think that? Phoenix: The killer could've falsified the time of death by using a certain item in the reception hall. Please take a look at this. Judge: And what is that contraption, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: It's a fog machine, Your Honor, used to create a special, romantic atmosphere in the hall. Judge: And this machine could have been used to falsify the time of death? Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor, because this machine uses dry ice to perform its magic. Judge: Dry ice? Ah yes -- the super cold stuff commonly used to make theatrical fog, right? I see. So your claim is that this dry ice was used to keep the body cold? Ema: ......Oh...! In that case, I guess the victim COULD have been killed before the reception... Judge: Order! Order in this court! Well, Mr. Edgeworth? What do you have to say about this development? Edgeworth: ......That the victim was killed in the hold before the wedding reception? .....The prosecution acknowledges the possibility of this claim. Phoenix: (Now we're getting somewhere!) Edgeworth: ...The prosecution would also like to thank you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Huh? For what? Edgeworth: I didn't know how a certain piece of evidence fit into this case... But now, thanks to you, I do. Phoenix: What piece of evidence? Edgeworth: To get into the hold, one needs a key card, like this one. And, here, we have a record of those who entered the hold with such key cards. The times aren't specified, but these are the last three entries on the day of the murder. And as you can see, the last person to enter the hold that day... was the defendant. Phoenix: Wh-What?! Judge: So the one who moved the body out of the hold must have been...? Edgeworth: That's right. It was none other than the defendant. Hold Entry Record added to the Court Record. Maya: Hey, Nick, take a look at this entry record. There are a couple of other names on here besides Ellen's. Phoenix: Hey, you're right! According to the entry record, Mr. Edgeworth, Pierce Nichody had also gone into the hold. Isn't it possible that he could've been the culprit? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Sorry, but Mr. Nichody was escorting a few of the guests at the time. I'm sure they would be happy to testify to that fact, if you'd like. Think me cocky all you'd like, Mr. Wright, but my confidence is rarely misplaced. Phoenix: Arngh... Edgeworth: Now then, it's probably safe to assume that after killing the victim in the hold... ...the defendant moved his body to the hall in order to dispose of it discreetly. Phoenix: What do you mean by \"discreetly\"? Edgeworth: The defendant volunteered to take care of the reception's cleanup personally. That means she would've had the chance to dispose of anything in any way she wanted. Including taking the lantern off the airship without raising any suspicion. Don't tell me you didn't know about Ms. Wyatt volunteering for cleanup duty, Mr. Wright. Ellen: For my last task as a servant of the Sprocket household... ...I offered to take on the preparation and cleanup of the reception banquet. Phoenix: I-I see... Phoenix: Gaaah! Edgeworth: Look at you, sweating buckets like a rookie... even after all these years. Nevertheless... Thank you for proving that the only person who could've killed the victim in the hold is... ...Ellen Wyatt! Phoenix: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! (Great job, Phoenix. Now we're back to square one!) Edgeworth: Heh. Perhaps you should ask Ms. Cykes for some help in reviewing Defense for Dummies. Ema: Way to go, sir! You've got Mr. Wright in a cold sweat! Edgeworth: Hmph. I wonder if maybe the promise of seeing that miserable look on his face... ...is what brought me back to court today. It's certainly made all of my stress and woes as chief prosecutor just melt away. Maya: I guess he had a lot of stress built up. Phoenix: I'll give him something to stress over before we're through today! Edgeworth: Your Honor, the prosecution asks that you render your verdict at this time. Before that man over there tries to throw the court into chaos with his meaningless bluffs. Judge: ...Hmm, I see. Mr. Wright... ...are there any last meaningful bluffs you'd like to present to this court? Phoenix: Uh... (Why does he have to assume it'll be a bluff?) Maya: N-Nick! Hurry up and throw a good one out there! Phoenix: I will! I will! ........... Well, all right, then. Let's see... I-I've got it! How do you know it was Ms. Wyatt who used her key card? After all, if it turns out that somebody else used her card... ...it would mean Ms. Wyatt didn't do it! Judge: Interesting. And are you able to prove this bluff to be true? Phoenix: I-I assure you, I'm not bluffing, Your Honor. (Well, now what...?) Maya: Wait a minute, Nick. I can think of a certain somebody who might've used Ellen's key card. Phoenix: You can? Maya: Remember? The one who was sneaking around the hold, in spite of not being a family member...? Phoenix: Oh, that's right! Your Honor! The defense would like to call a certain witness to the stand! I need the testimony of this person, who may have entered the hold with Ms. Wyatt's card! Present Larry Butz profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Th-That's your witness?!\" Present anyone else Phoenix: Phoenix: This person used Ms. Wyatt's key card to enter the hold! Edgeworth: What are you talking about, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Wait, did I make a mistake...? Edgeworth: You would know if you had been paying any attention to our arguments up to this point. Phoenix: ...Ahem. So... So that means... Judge: Exactly. It means you get a penalty. Phoenix: I was afraid of that. Edgeworth: I'd advise you to take this a little more seriously, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: And I will! Your Honor! The defense would like to call a certain witness to the stand! Leads back to: \"I need the testimony of this person, who may have entered the hold with Ms. Wyatt's card!\" Edgeworth: Th-That's your witness?! A-Are you saying that THAT numbskull was on the airship? He never breathed a word about that to me! Phoenix: That's not surprising, because Mr. Nichody told him to keep quiet about it. But Mr. Butz himself admitted it to me. He claimed to have found a way to sneak into the Flying Chapel's hold to see Ms. Wyatt. This photo he took and gave to me is proof. Edgeworth: Th-Then was it he who moved the lantern with the body inside to the reception hall? Phoenix: You know as well as I that with him, anything is possible. And this is one possibility we should definitely look into. Edgeworth: .....I-I can't believe this. What in the world is HE doing mixed up in this? Phoenix: Come on, Mr. Edgeworth. Remember what we've been saying since elementary school? Edgeworth: .....\"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\" Phoenix: Exactly. Edgeworth: Gaaaaaagh! That Larry! He'll pay for this! Phoenix: Well, if you want to extract your payment now... ...he's right up there in the gallery! Larry: Yikes! Judge: Bailiff! Seize the witness before he makes a run for it! Larry: Noooooooooooooooooo! Why does this stuff always happen to MEEEEEEEEEE?! Phoenix: (Sorry, Larry... but you brought this on yourself.) Judge: Let us break for a fifteen minute recess. I ask that both sides prepare for the next witness's testimony during this time. September 22District Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Maya: Wow. It's been a while since I've had this much fun and excitement! A face-off against Mr. Edgeworth! A harrowing tightrope walk for the defense! Phoenix: Whew! I'm exhausted already. ???: Boss! Athena: I'm here for moral support! Phoenix: Athena! Are you all done practicing for Trucy's magic show? Athena: Well... to be perfectly honest... I sorta ran away. But that's because she was putting my life in danger, I tell you! Phoenix: I see... I think I'll need to have a one-on-one with her... You're really athletic and fit, Athena, so Trucy probably thinks she can run you ragged. Athena: That may be true... ...which is why not even Trucy can keep up with me when I run at full speed! ???: Hah! Looks like you spoke too soon, Athena! Never underestimate the resourcefulness of a great magician! Athena: Huh? Trucy: Magical Girl Trucy Wright... is on the scene! Athena: N-Nooooooooooooooooooo! Trucy: Now, Athena! It's time to practice human combustion magic! Go on, douse yourself in this gasoline! But don't worry! It's a magic trick, after all, so it's perfectly safe! Athena: ......R... R... Run awaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!!! Trucy: Hey, you! You're not getting off that easily! Maya: Ha ha ha! They get along so well, don't they? It reminds me of the good ol' days. You, me and Pearly... Oh, and Detective Gumshoe! Can't forget him. We had all kinds of fun at the crime scenes back then, remember? Phoenix: ...Leaving me to do all the serious investigating as I recall. Bailiff: Court will soon be back in session, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Right, thank you! Maya: So Larry's the next witness, right? I can't wait to see what happens! Phoenix: Sadly, I can already imagine it... September 22District Court - Courtroom No. 6 Judge: Court will now reconvene. Larry: ......Nick! Edgey! The two of you are gonna hang me out to dry, aren't you?! Edgeworth: No, not the both of us. Just Mr. Wright. Larry: N-Nick... How could you...? Phoenix: (I don't really think he did it, of course, but I've gotta use whatever leads I can...) Mr. Butz, there's a possibility you moved the lantern that had the dead body in it. So if you want to clear yourself of any suspicion, all you have to do is testify. Larry: ............ Judge: Now then, your testimony, please, witness. Witness Testimony -- Nick Is A Jerk Face! -- Larry: Nick, you big, fat, stinkin' jerk! How can you doubt your best bud?! We've known each other since elementary school! W-W-Well, get this, pal! Our friendship's over! Phoenix: ............ Judge: ............ Maya: ............ Edgeworth: ............ Judge: .....Well, go ahead, Mr. Wright. He's all yours. Phoenix: Why me?! Edgeworth: You're the one who called him to the stand, so he's your responsibility. Phoenix: Thanks, old chum... Larry: C-Can't any of you show me a little respect?! Even just a shred?! Judge: You may cross-examine the witness, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (I would, if there were any testimony to cross-examine...) Cross Examination -- Nick Is A Jerk Face! -- Larry: Nick, you big, fat, stinkin' jerk! Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Come on, Larry... Can't you please give me something real to work with? Larry: Don't think I don't know about your tricks! If I say something careless, you're gonna shove some evidence at me with a loud... ...\"Objection!\" and a super smug look on your face! Phoenix: Y-Yeah, well... that IS my job... Larry: And if I get found guilty, how are you gonna take responsibility for what you've done?! Phoenix: Why should I take responsibility for just doing my job? Larry: You heartless jerk! Don't you have any compassion for me?!

Phoenix: Larry, just tell us the truth already. Did you or didn't you go into the hold and move a lantern up to the reception hall? Larry: I... I never moved any bull lantern, I tell ya! Phoenix: \"Bull lantern\"? Larry: Wh-What? Did I say something weird? Phoenix: You told me that you didn't attend the wedding reception. Larry: Can you believe they told me only family and relatives could attend?! They wouldn't even let me into the reception hall! Larry: Uh, y-yeah. So what? Phoenix: Then, that's odd... No one in this courtroom ever mentioned the sex of the lantern that was moved. So how could you know that it was a \"bull\" lantern? Larry: Y-You didn't have to actually go to the reception to know that! Anyone could tell there were two Pegabulls by looking at the Flying Chapel's pamphlet! Phoenix: (All I can tell right now is that there's a strong scent of bull in the air in here.) Please add that last statement to your testimony, Mr. Butz.

Because you're you, that's why! Larry: Edgey...! You think Nick's being awful to me, don't you? So you tell him...! Tell Nick what a big meanie he is! Edgeworth: I would... if I thought he was being one. Larry: N-Not you, too! Why doesn't anybody ever take my side?! Phoenix: (I wish I didn't have to doubt him... But something about what he just said doesn't add up.) Present Flying Chapel Pamphlet Phoenix: Leads to: \"I want you to take a look at this, Mr. Butz.\" Before adding statement Phoenix: Well, I guess about all I can do... ...is try to get some kind of statement out of him somehow. Maya: Good luck. After adding statement Maya: You finally got a decent statement out of him, huh, Nick! Phoenix: Yeah, finally. (It sure took a lot of work, though... I hope all of this leads somewhere...) Phoenix: I want you to take a look at this, Mr. Butz. Because unfortunately for you, the pamphlet clearly shows... ...a Pegacow and a Pegabull in their example diagram of the reception hall. Larry: Huh?! Phoenix: But on that day, instead of putting a Pegacow and Pegabull out for the bride and groom... ...there were two male Pegabulls on display. Larry: Nnnnngh... Phoenix: Yet, somehow, you knew there were two Pegabulls in the reception hall that day. There's only one way you'd know something like that, Larry... It was YOU who moved the Pegabull to the reception hall, wasn't it?! Larry: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Edgeworth: N-No... Larry, y-you didn't...! Judge: Mr. Butz, did you move the lantern containing the victim's body to the reception hall? Larry: Th-That's what it looks like! Maya: Whaaaaat?! Phoenix: ............! Larry: Larry: W-Wait! Nick! Y-You don't think I'M the murderer, do ya?! Maya: Maybe you and Mr. Gloomsbury were fighting over Ms. Wyatt, and you ended up killing him? Larry: M-Mayaaaaa! Not you, tooooo! Look, I did sneak into the reception, but that's as far as it went. You know me! I wouldn't hurt a fly! Phoenix: Y-You \"snuck into the reception\"...? Larry: Yeah, sure. But some of the Sprocket men caught and locked me up in one of the cabins. It was pretty awful, actually! But that's when I made that drawing of the pterodactyl I showed you, Nick! Phoenix: (Ix-nay on the erodactyl-ptay, Larry...) Edgeworth: Mr. Wright, not even you would take this farce that far... would you? Phoenix: ............ (We ARE talking about Larry... What do I do? Do I accuse Larry of being the true culprit?) Accuse him Phoenix: (I guess I have no choice but to accuse him...! Wait a minute... But Larry didn't have any reason to kill Gloomsbury!) Leads to: \"No, you're right, Mr. Edgeworth.\" No, of course not Leads to: \"No, you're right, Mr. Edgeworth.\" Phoenix: No, you're right, Mr. Edgeworth. Mr. Butz didn't have a reason to kill Mr. Gloomsbury. He might've had an imaginary reason to kill Sorin Sprocket, sure, but not Mr. Gloomsbury. Maya: After all, he did steal Mr. Sprocket's bride and try to elope with her... Larry: Just 'cause I tried to steal somebody's bride doesn't make me a murderer! Phoenix: ......I believe you, Larry. And I don't think you killed anybody, either. You would never do anything like that. Larry: N-Nick, ol' buddy, ol' pal! I knew you'd come through for me! Phoenix: (Funny, that, considering your sworn testimony just now that we were through...) Judge: Mr. Butz, it's time you told this court the whole truth. Understood? Witness Testimony -- Moving the Lantern -- Larry: It's just like Nick said, I'm the one who moved the lantern. I was poking around the reception hall before the main event and saw a lantern was broken. There was a note on it that said, \"Exchange with the one in the hold. --Ellen.\" So I decided to do Elly a favor. Judge: So you switched the lanterns before the reception, did you? Then that means the victim really WAS killed before the reception. Broken Lantern updated in the Court Record. Edgeworth: It would appear... that Mr. Butz completely fell for the defendant's scheme. Larry: Scheme? What scheme? Edgeworth: This note from the defendant: \"Exchange with the one in the hold. --Ellen\"... Mr. Butz moved the lantern with the body in it up to the reception hall because of this note. And thus, he has become a suspect in Mr. Gloomsbury's murder. Larry: *gulp*... That second lantern did feel pretty heavy... ...but I never would've thought there was a dead body in it! Phoenix: (Arnngh... What was a note like that doing on a lantern in the first place...?!) Ellen: Ellen: You've got it all wrong, Mr. Edgeworth! I left that note for myself! It was simply a reminder because I can be very forgetful! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What a sorry excuse, Ms. Wyatt. The prosecution contends that this note shows one facet of the defendant's murderous plan. And you, Mr. Butz, you played right into Ms. Wyatt's hands. Larry: No way, Edgey! I don't believe it! Phoenix: Phoenix: Do you still really believe Ms. Wyatt to be the culprit, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Hmph. Of course. My stance on the matter remains unchanged. If you think I'm wrong, then prove it with your cross-examination. Phoenix: (Gladly!) Judge: Very well. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness. Cross Examination -- Moving the Lantern -- Larry: It's just like Nick said, I'm the one who moved the lantern. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why didn't you tell us that sooner?! Larry: Because I knew you guys were gonna be suspicious of me, that's why! Phoenix: We're suspicious of you now because you tried to hide it! Edgeworth: My thoughts exactly. Larry: Hmph! Well, now I've told you! Happy? So how about letting me go?! Phoenix: No, not yet. We need you to stick around to sort a few things out. Larry: Grrrrr! FINE! Larry: I was poking around the reception hall before the main event and saw a lantern was broken. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The lantern you swapped out was a female Pegamoo -- a Pegacow, right? Larry: Yeah, I guess. Phoenix: Why did you replace a female lantern with a male one? Larry: Because I was too busy trying not to get caught. I didn't have time to check for little details like that. Phoenix: If you didn't want to get caught, you could've just left well enough alone, you know. Larry: Whatever! Anyway, when I took a look at the broken lantern, I saw... Larry: There was a note on it that said, \"Exchange with the one in the hold. --Ellen.\" Press Phoenix: Phoenix: That note wasn't addressed to you, was it? Larry: Well, I guess not, but... ...how could I let my dear, sweet Elly do all that hard physical labor on her own?! Phoenix: (It's precisely that thought process that constantly gets you in trouble, Larry...) Larry: Besides, it was my big chance to show her how much I cared about her. Larry: So I decided to do Elly a favor. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Nobody saw you the whole time while you were switching the lanterns? Larry: Nope. I didn't get caught. Not that time, anyway. Phoenix: \"Not that time\"? Larry: Yeah. When I'd tried to sneak into the reception hall the first time... ...I didn't have as much luck. Those Sprocket guys spotted me and nabbed me. Phoenix: All of my words are failing me right now... Larry: Pretty exciting, don't ya think? Phoenix: (Larry... You need help.) Larry: And then they locked me up in one of the cabins. ......Nick, what are you asking about stuff like this for, anyway? Shouldn't you be trying to prove Elly's innocence?! Phoenix: (Well... Is that statement of his important to the case...?) It's important Phoenix: Mr. Butz trying to crash the reception, and subsequently getting locked up in a cabin... I believe these might be important facts in this case, Your Honor. Judge: Very well. Mr. Butz, please add that statement to your testimony. Adds statement \"I tried to sneak into the reception hall, but I got caught and locked up in a cabin.\" It's not important Phoenix: Given the lack of any important info... I guess I can let this line of questioning go for now. Leads back to cross-examination Press (after adding statement) Phoenix: Phoenix: Nobody saw you the whole time while you were switching the lanterns? Larry: Nope. I didn't get caught. Not that time, anyway. Phoenix: \"Not that time\"? Larry: Yeah. When I'd tried to sneak into the reception hall the first time... ...I didn't have as much luck. Those Sprocket guys spotted me and nabbed me. Phoenix: All of my words are failing me right now... Larry: Pretty exciting, don't ya think? Phoenix: (Larry... You need help.) Larry: And then they locked me up in one of the cabins. ......Nick, what are you asking about stuff like this for, anyway? Shouldn't you be trying to prove Elly's innocence?! Larry: I tried to sneak into the reception hall, but I got caught and locked up in a cabin. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you got locked up. Then what happened? Larry: I broke out. Then I started looking for Elly and wandered into the reception hall again. That's when I saw the broken lantern and replaced it. Phoenix: ......Even after they caught you and locked you up, you still went looking for Ms. Wyatt? ...But, hold on a minute... Maya: What is it, Nick? Phoenix: Maya, doesn't something seem weird to you? Larry is saying he replaced the lantern after he broke out of the cabin. Maya: That's right-- Oh, wait... Huh? You're right. It doesn't make much sense, does it? Judge: Mr. Wright, have you found an inconsistency in the witness's statement? Phoenix: Yes, I believe so, Your Honor. Mr. Butz moved the lantern after he broke out of the cabin, but that contradicts with this. Present Broken Lantern Phoenix: Leads to: \"Is that...?!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Judge: Hmm... And in what sense does that piece of evidence contradict with the statement? Larry: It doesn't contradict at all, does it! Edgeworth: Indeed. Phoenix: Urngh...! Oh, don't mind me, Your Honor. It looks like I just made a tiny mistake. That's all. Leads back to cross-examination Phoenix: Knowing Larry... ...he definitely did something stupid somewhere along the way. Maya: Wow. Larry sure is one special guy... Not everyone has the privilege of being THIS distrusted by their best friends... Phoenix: Assuming he can't be trusted from the get-go usually makes things easier, I've learned. Maya: Oh, I see! You totally trust him to be totally untrustworthy! Phoenix: Yeah, I guess that just about sums it up. Judge: Is that...?! Phoenix: Yes, it's the broken lantern, Your Honor. Mr. Butz, what you're saying doesn't make any sense at all. Larry: WHAT?! Why not?! Phoenix: You swapped the lanterns before the reception began, right? Larry: Yeah. That's what I said, isn't it? Phoenix: But you also just said that you swapped the lanterns... ...after you got locked up in a cabin for trying to sneak into the reception. In other words, you're saying you swapped the lanterns both before the reception... ...and after the reception took place. Judge: Hmm... That certainly doesn't make any sense, does it? Mr. Butz, did you swap the lanterns before or after the reception? Larry: Umm... Edgeworth: Which was it: before or after?! There's a world of difference between the two! Phoenix: Well, Mr. Butz? Larry: ......I guess I can't expect guys like you to understand. In a nutshell, it was both before... and after the reception. Phoenix: What? Larry: I tried to sneak into the first reception and got locked up. Phoenix: The \"first\" reception? (Uh-oh. I don't like where this is going...) Larry: Then, through the power of Elly's pendant... ...time got rewound, and we went back to the time before the reception. It was after that when I replaced the lantern. So it was both before the reception and after the reception. Get it? Phoenix: ............ Larry: We went back in time to before the reception. So, of course, the reception would take place one more time after that, right? That's why what I said makes perfect sense! Edgeworth: ......Mr. Wright, what in the world is the witness talking about? Has he developed some sort of intellectual ailment I'm not aware of since I saw him last? Phoenix: ...Um, well... Larry: None of the Sprockets seem to remember the time skip, but I do. And Elly remembers it, too! I think the power of our love for each other made that miracle happen! Judge: Mr. Wright. I'm sorry, but... ...could you please translate this man's gibberish so the rest of us can understand? Phoenix: (So now I have to be the one to explain about the whole time travel thing?!) Larry: Go on, Nick. I know you can do it! Maya: Looks like you don't have much choice, Nick! Phoenix: (To heck with it! I can't lose any more of my dignity today anyway!) ............ The defendant, Ms. Ellen Wyatt, has told the defense the following strange story. She said that after the reception ended, she was attacked by Mr. Gloomsbury. She claims that, as she was being assaulted, she made a wish upon her pendant. \"Please, take me back... back to that blissful moment...!\" In doing so... ...time apparently rewound itself to just before the reception began! Edgeworth: ......It what? Phoenix: I know it's hard to believe, but think about it this way. Through the power of the pendant, both Ellen Wyatt and Larry Butz... ...experienced time travel! Judge: Wh-Wh-Wh.... WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What absolute rubbish! Mr. Wright! I've heard my fair share of your nonsense over the years... ...but this takes the cake! Have you thoroughly lost your mind?! Phoenix: Phoenix: But this is simply the conclusion I came to... ...using that logic ability you love so much. Edgeworth: Wh-What? Phoenix: The truth of the matter is, the future president of Sprocket Aviation, Sorin Sprocket... ...has been researching time machines. So, what if a time machine has already been successfully created? And what if that's one of Sprocket Aviation's top secret inventions? Judge: A-A time machine?! Larry: Yeah! I even saw something while we were time traveling! I saw a pterodactyl flying through the sky! Maybe the airship was set to travel through time for their honeymoon trip? Judge: WHAAAAAAAAAT?! A-A pterodactyl?! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Y-You can't possibly have any evidence to back up your ridiculous time travel story...! Phoenix: Well... I, uh... Edgeworth: Hmph. As I thought. In any case, I now have the evidence to prove... ...that you're no more intelligent than Larry! Larry: Larry: Not so fast now, Edgey. I'm not the same ol' Larry you used to know. Edgeworth: .........Oh? Larry: You want evidence? I've got your evidence right here! This is a photo I secretly took of the first reception! Edgeworth: WHAT?! Phoenix: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! L-Larry! I can't believe you--! ......Well, anyway, good job! If we compare the photos of the first and second receptions and can find a difference... ...then we'll be able to prove that the reception was held twice! Judge: But do you really think such a difference exists? Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. I just need some time to find it for you. Edgeworth: This is preposterous! Judge: Very well. Please show the court what's different, then. Phoenix: This is proof positive that the wedding reception was held twice. Present Ellen Wyatt's bouquet Phoenix: Leads to: \"Please direct your attention to Ms. Wyatt's bouquet of flowers!\" Present anywhere else Phoenix: Phoenix: Here it is! This is proof that the reception was held twice! Judge: ...Where? Phoenix: Right here, Your Honor! Judge: ........... ......Right where? Phoenix: Um... Right... not here, maybe? Judge: It appears you've missed the mark, defense. I hope you take better aim next time before you fire off that mouth of yours! Phoenix: (But my aim is usually impeccable! I'd better take another good look at the two photos before I answer again, though!) Leads back to: \"This is proof positive that the wedding reception was held twice.\" Phoenix: Please direct your attention to Ms. Wyatt's bouquet of flowers! In the photo one of her in-laws took, the defendant is holding a yellow bouquet. But in the photo Mr. Butz took, she is holding a red bouquet! Maya: Y-You're right! Edgeworth: ......That's... impossible! Judge: Wh-What does this mean? Phoenix: It means that the defendant really did experience two wedding receptions! And she did that... when she traveled back through time! Judge: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Maya: N-Nick! You did it! You proved Ellen's time travel story to be true! Phoenix: Yeah... I can hardly believe it myself... (It's just as Ellen said -- the reception was held twice. This turns every assumption we've based this trial on upside down!) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ......I refuse to accept such a ludicrous argument! It is pure fiction under the guise of pseudoscience, at best! There is simply no such thing as time travel! Phoenix: I know it's hard, but can't you suspend your disbelief for one nanosecond, Edgeworth? Maya: I bet sci-fi movies push all your buttons the wrong way, don't they, Mr. Edgeworth...? I can totally picture you yelling, \"That'd never happen!\" every five seconds at the screen. Maybe you should stay away from movie dates altogether... Edgeworth: That's neither here nor there! This is real life we're talking about! Judge: But the proof is clearly shown in the two photographs. Phoenix: That's right, Mr. Edgeworth, no matter how inexplica-- Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Fine. I'll entertain your absurd delusion... ...if only to demolish it before your very eyes! Phoenix: What? Edgeworth: ......Let's start with this, then, shall we? There is one thing your time travel theory fails to explain. And that is the memories of the other guests there. The defendant and Larry remember the reception occurring twice... ...but no member of the Sprocket family has even mentioned such a thing. Phoenix: That's because the time machine is classified technolog-- Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I'm not done, you birdbrain! Phoenix: B-Birdbrain?! Edgeworth: As I was saying, if the entire family had been sworn to secrecy... ...then why hadn't they sworn the woman who was marrying into the family to secrecy, too? Phoenix: Th-That's a good point... Edgeworth: Honestly. All it takes is a little common sense, Mr. Wright. Judge: Hmm... Even still... ...how do we know that the trip through time did not really occur? There is proof in the photos that it did. And besides, if time travel doesn't exist, well... ...I'd be a little disappointed, frankly. I was hoping to go back to the days of my youth-- Edgeworth: You mustn't allow yourself to be taken in by Mr. Wright's whimsical tales, Your Honor. I've read about it in various literature, you see... And they all say that time travel is just not logically feasible. Phoenix: Nnnnngh... Maya: Hmm... Maybe our argument was just a little too nonsensical, Nick... Phoenix: ......Well, in that case... ...why don't we put \"common sense\" to the test? Edgeworth: Excuse me? Phoenix: The wedding reception was held twice. The photos are proof of that. But it wasn't because of time travel. It's simply because the reception had actually been held twice. Isn't that the most reasonable way to interpret the situation? Judge: Hmm... Would you care to elaborate, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: (If time travel doesn't exist, then there's only one way to make sense of what happened!) Somebody must've orchestrated this strange phenomenon. And that somebody is... Everyone at the reception Leads to: \"What if all of the guests at the reception conspired together...\" Gloomsbury Phoenix: Mr. Gloomsbury! Judge: ......Hm? Edgeworth: And how exactly did a dead man orchestrate such an event? And more importantly, why? Phoenix: W-Well, it was... ...to make it look like Mr. Sprocket had been successful in his research...? Edgeworth: What are you asking me for?! Besides, none of the other people interviewed... ...thought that he had succeeded in accomplishing time travel! Phoenix: Your Honor, could we rewind time... by just a teeny bit? Judge: Sorry, but no. Phoenix: (I'd better rethink this quick, before I lose any more time, too.) Leads back to: \"Somebody must've orchestrated this strange phenomenon. And that somebody is...\" The gods Phoenix: Such a mysterious phenomenon could only have been caused by... ...the gods themselves! Judge: Hmm... I suppose the gods would be able to rewind time... ...or make the wedding reception happen twice, wouldn't they? Phoenix: Indeed they would, Your Honor! Judge: In that case, Mr. Wright... ...please bring these gods here to testify before this court. Phoenix: Um, Maya...? Do you think you could...? Maya: ...Not a chance. Judge: On behalf of the gods who can't be here today, please, have some divine punishment. Phoenix: (I knew I was reaching with that one... I guess I'd better come up with something more grounded next time...) Leads back to: \"Somebody must've orchestrated this strange phenomenon. And that somebody is...\" Phoenix: What if all of the guests at the reception conspired together... ...to hold the reception twice and keep quiet about it? Edgeworth: What? ......And for what purpose would they conspire to do such a thing? Phoenix: ......Well, uh... .................. *clap clap clap clap* ???: Ha ha ha! A brilliant deduction, defense. Nichody: I can tell that you are not a renowned lawyer for nothing. I must say, I underestimated you. Phoenix: How so, Mr. Nichody? Nichody: You have managed to name each event, precisely as they happened. You have revealed it all to the light of day. Phoenix: Th-Then, that means... Nichody: It was us. We orchestrated the whole thing. Yes, the reception was held twice. But not because of time travel, no -- we simply held it a second time. Edgeworth: WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Why?! Why would you do such a thing?! Nichody: To make it as though the murder Miss Ellen committed... never happened. Edgeworth: Nnngh! Nichody: Master Sorin figured that if Miss Ellen, who'd killed Gloomsbury after the first reception... ...experienced the reception one more time, she would think it was all a dream. It was he who ordered us to make it happen. However, only a few, myself included, knew of Miss Ellen's crime. Judge: Are you saying most of the guests attended two receptions without knowing why? Nichody: Indeed. They needed no reason... Master Sorin told them to do it, and do it they did. That is the Sprocket way. Phoenix: Then who hid the body in the lantern? Nichody: We did. But we did not anticipate the petals finding their way in, nor the actions of Mr. Butz. Edgeworth: And that's how you intended to cover the whole situation up?! Nichody: There is just one thing everyone here has wrong. The real scene of the murder was not the hold. It was the vista deck. Phoenix: What?! Th-Then Ms. Wyatt's recollection of the events must be correct! Nichody: I admit we tried to cover this incident up. But the fact that Miss Ellen killed Gloomsbury is undeniable. Judge: This is quite a turn of events! ???: ......... ......Heh heh heh. Edgeworth: And so it appears we have arrived at the truth at last. Phoenix: Now, now... Edgeworth: Please do feel free to travel back in time, Mr. Wright... ...and attempt to do this trial over again. Go on. Phoenix: Let's not get hasty, Edgeworth... Edgeworth: I bet you can't do it! Phoenix: I bet I can't, eeeeeiiiither! Edgeworth: Your Honor, we will have to hold a separate trial for the cover-up conspiracy later. But as far as this case goes... ...I believe we are ready for your ruling. Judge: Hmm... Phoenix: Phoenix: Just before the defendant lost consciousness during her attack... ...she says she saw someone strike the victim. It's possible that this third party is the true culprit! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You still want us to believe the defendant's words? Perhaps you've lost more than your touch during your time abroad. This \"third person\" nonsense is nothing but rubbish, and you know it! Phoenix: Phoenix: But, by the same token... ...how can we trust those who conspired and lied to fool this court of law? For all we know, they might still be hiding something! Edgeworth: Nrgh... You never know when to quit, do you?! Judge: Now, now. Calm down, both of you. In any case, there isn't enough trustworthy information yet for me to render a verdict. I suggest we continue the trial after both sides have investigated the matter further. Edgeworth: ......Nnnnrrrrgh. Very well, Your Honor. Phoenix: (Phew! That was close...) Judge: Mr. Nichody... As for you and your cohorts' attempt to cover up this crime... ...your case will be brought to a separate trial following the resolution of this current one. Nichody: Understood, Your Honor. Judge: Well, then... This concludes today's trial. Court is adjourned! To be continued Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor, I have a feeling this piece of evidence contradicts the witness's statement! Judge: ...A \"feeling,\" defense? Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor... Or, rather, a \"hope\" that it indicates a contradiction... Judge: Mr. Wright. Is there or isn't there a contradiction here? Phoenix: It looks like there is... but there really isn't one, is there? Judge: Are you asking me, Mr. Wright? Because what it really seems like to me is you're asking for a penalty! Phoenix: Thanks for that definitive answer, Your Honor... Edgeworth: *sigh* With a lawyer like you, Mr. Wright, even I feel bad for the defendant. Phoenix: (Well, you don't have to feel bad for her for long! I'll get it right next time, you'll see!) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor, the witness's statement contains a glaring contradiction! And this is the piece of evidence that says it all! ............. ............... Judge: ...Will it start saying something anytime soon, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: ............ ............ ...It's not speaking up at all, is it? Maybe it's being shy? Judge: ...... Your evidence has said nothing at all to this court. But your choice of tactics speaks volumes about you, defense! Maya: Even I knew that wasn't a very smart move, Nick... Phoenix: Arrrngh... Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: The witness's statement is inconsistent with this piece of evidence! Edgeworth: ...Mr. Wright. Would you care to tell this court what percent sure you are of your claim? Phoenix: Why, of course! I'm a hundre--! Well, er... ninety... Wait, maybe eighty-ish...? W-Would you accept... fifty percent? Judge: Mr. Wright! I won't have such half-hearted bluffing in my courtroom! Edgeworth: Your Honor. Might I recommend that the defense be penalized with one-hundred-percent severity? Judge: Oh, I intend to, Mr. Edgeworth! You can be sure of that! Phoenix: Nngh... (Guess I can't say I deserved zero percent of that...) Consult (when evidence must be presented) Phoenix: So, what do you think we should do now, Maya? Maya: That one statement sounds awfully fishy to me, Nick. Phoenix: ...Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. Maya: So now it's just a matter of deciding which piece of evidence to present, right? Phoenix: Yeah. I'll take another look at the evidence and compare it to that statement, then. Consult (when statements must be pressed) Phoenix: So... what now? Maya: Well, you can press the witness some more... ...and try and get new information out of them, right? Phoenix: Right. (Guess I'd better get down to pressing the witness, then.) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! I see no need to further prolong this trial. The defense's case is insufficient to overturn the prosecution's claims! This court finds the defendant, Ellen Wyatt... Guilty Turnabout Time Traveler Image Gallery Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 September 22, 1:48 PMWright Anything Agency Athena: Whaaaaaaaaaaaaat?! So the whole time traveling thing... ...was just a ruse put on by the guests at the reception? Phoenix: Looks like it. I knew there had to be some kind of trick to it. Athena: Wow. Two wedding receptions! Can you imagine? I wonder how much THAT must've cost them! Phoenix: I-I have no idea... But if you have to ask, you're not rich enough to want to know... Still, if you've got the money, it's a pretty good way to cover things up, if you ask me. Athena: You got that right...! I'm sure I would've been completely fooled. Maya: Hi! I'm back! Phoenix: Hey, Maya. Are you all set to go? Maya: Yup! Ready when you are! So! What should we start with? Phoenix: Hmm... Let's start with reviewing what we learned at the trial. What Ellen thought was time travel was really just a performance put on by the Sprockets. But other than that, it seems that what Ellen told us was actually all true. Maya: So what really matters right now is... ...the identity of the mystery person Ellen said she saw while she was being attacked! Athena: So, who IS this mystery person? Phoenix: That's the million-dollar question, I'm afraid. But if we want to clear Ellen of any suspicion, then figuring out who they are is key. Athena: I think I'll take \"Toilets\" for $200, instead, Mr. Wright... Phoenix: Well, at least there were only so many people on that airship that night. And we know who the mastermind of the whole cover-up plot was, too, so that's good. Athena: You mean the groom, Sorin Sprocket, right? Phoenix: Exactly. He might know something that could help us out. ???: So then, what am I doing here? Larry: I'm a very busy man, you know. Phoenix: Well, all of the other people involved are Sorin's family members. So I thought I'd better start by interviewing you. (Even if I probably shouldn't trust a word out of your mouth...) Larry: Oh, man... I have a really tight schedule, but... aw heck, what are friends for, right? Okay, pal! Go ahead, ask me anything! Phoenix: (Um, you DO remember it was you who came to me for help in the first place, right...?) Talk The incident Phoenix: I want to go over exactly WHAT happened WHEN before I step outside this office again. Since you were there, Larry, do you think you could help me get it all straight in my head? Larry: *sigh* If I gotta... Phoenix: Okay. So, the first reception was held at 7 PM on the day of the incident. That's the one you tried to crash, right? Larry: Huh? Oh, yeah, that's right. And then they locked me up in a cabin! It was awful, I tell you! Phoenix: (Too bad we're not here to focus on you, Larry.) And then the incident occurred after this first reception, at around 10 PM. Ellen was attacked in the reception hall by Gloomsbury. He forced her out onto the vista deck and was just about to kill her... Larry: But Elly fought back, and ended up killing ol' Gloomsbury instead. To cover it up, the family quickly threw together a second reception. That's what Edgey is claiming, anyway. But I know my Elly didn't do it! Phoenix: The key point here is the mystery person Ellen said she saw strike Gloomsbury... ...just before she passed out. Did you see anybody suspicious skulking around that day? Larry: Nope. Not a soul! Because I was locked up in a cabin at the time! Phoenix: But you managed to escape, and sneak back into the reception hall. That's when you switched the lantern in the event hall with the lantern in the hold, right? Did you see anybody then? Larry: Nope. The place was completely deserted. I guess 'cause that Pierce butler guy had everybody gathered together somewhere. Phoenix: That makes sense. He must've been going over the cover-up plan with them. (So, clearly, the murder had already happened by the time Larry got out...) They must've gotten everything ready fast, and had the second reception soon after that. Larry: Then, after that second reception, Elly went to clean up the reception hall... ...and, as luck would have it, that's when she found the body in the lantern I'd brought up. I tried to do something nice for Elly out of the goodness of my heart, and THIS happened! Phoenix: Hmm... We still don't know exactly what happened during the actual murder itself. We'll just have to look into it, along with the identity of that mystery person... The cabin (appears after \"The incident\") Leads to: \"So while the murder was taking place, you were locked up in a cabin.\" Phoenix: So while the murder was taking place, you were locked up in a cabin. Did you see anything unusual while you were in there? Larry: In the cabin? Let's see... Well... there was that pterodactyl flying through the sky! That's pretty unusual! Phoenix: Oh, right. That drawing of that \"pterodactyl\" you \"saw\"... Larry: What's with all the air quotes?! I really did see it! I swear! Phoenix: But, Larry, the time travel thing never actually happened. Which means you couldn't have seen a real pterodactyl flying through the sky! Larry: O-Oh... Are you doubting the eye of a super-popular picture book author?! Phoenix: No, I'm sure you saw something else, and mistook that for a flying reptile. Larry: Niiiiiick! You're making me doubt my own eyes! Now I'm not even sure WHAT I saw! Larry's Drawing updated in the Court Record. Phoenix: Either way, you have no idea what actually happened at the real scene of the murder? Larry: That's right! And I can say that with every confidence! Oh, wow. Would ya look at the time? I'd better go. I have a book signing to get to. Phoenix: A book signing? Whose book? Larry: Whose do you think?! It's mine, of course! It's a Laurice Deauxnim book signing! Phoenix: I bet you went around and begged a bunch of bookstores to let you do one. Larry: O-Of course not! Th-They're the ones coming around to beg ME! Phoenix: (Looks like I guessed right...) Larry: A-Anyway, I have to go! I'll send you ten copies of my new book that just got released the other day, all right?! Phoenix: T-Ten? That's very generous of you... Larry: What are you talking about? I'm gonna send you the bill, too, of course. Just put 'em down as office expenses or something. Well, see ya! Phoenix: W-Wait, Larry! We don't need... ...Argh. He's gone. Athena: I'll take a copy, Boss! Oh, and make sure it's signed! Phoenix: Oh, boy... (Trucy's not gonna like this \"office expense.\") Maya: There goes our first lead. What do you want to tackle next, Nick? Phoenix: Right, we should really hit the streets now, huh? How about we go see Ellen? Athena: Sounds good, Boss! I bet I can cheer her up! Phoenix: I thought you were going to help Trucy with her magic show again today, Athena? Weren't you supposed to go meet her right about now? Trucy said she was going to practice her new trick on you, if I recall. Athena: \"On me\"...?! Really? Phoenix: Trucy's show is an important source of income for our agency, you know. You can leave the case to us, so you go ahead and run along, now. Athena: B-But, Boss...! Phoenix: Off you go, Athena! Athena: Nooooo... I don't wanna dieeeee... Phoenix: We'd better get going, too, Maya. Maya: Okay! Talk Any ideas? Maya: ............ Phoenix: Why the long face, Maya? Maya: I can't believe time travel isn't real after all... Phoenix: I see... Maya: I thought I'd get to go back in time and see real dinosaurs and ninjas and stuff! Phoenix: Yeah... Too bad, huh? (I couldn't be more relieved, personally.) What to do Phoenix: So, what should we do? Maya: Oh, I don't know... I mean, shouldn't we just keep investigating stuff or something? Phoenix: (She's really lost that spark... ...ever since I proved that time traveling wasn't real in court today...) September 22Detention Center - Visitor's Room Ellen: Oooooh... My poor, sweet Sorin...! I wonder how he's getting along without me... Phoenix: Hello, Ellen. Ellen: Oh, Mr. Wright! What's going to happen with the trial, do you think? Phoenix: Well, first and foremost... ...we have to hurry up and find this mystery person you saw just before you passed out. Ellen: Do you think that person could be the real killer? Phoenix: It's quite possible. And if we can prove that, we can clear you of all charges. Actually, would you happen to know where Sorin is right now? Ellen: He's usually busy with meetings all afternoon, but he should be home by evening. Phoenix: I think I'd better go have a chat with him later, then. (Why am I being treated to a view of someone's underwear...?) Ellen: Mr. Wright! Don't tell me... ...you suspect my sweet Sorin?! Phoenix: Well, he is the one who masterminded the second reception after the \"time skip\"... ...so I thought he might be able to tell us something. Ellen: How COULD you, Mr. Wright?! You can't possibly think--! My Sorin would NEVER kill anyone! Phoenix: A-All right, all right! Just calm down! Ellen: NO, not if you're accusing my Sorin! Phoenix: Please! I'm not accusing anybody! So please put the pan and ladle down, all right? Ellen: Really...? Phoenix: C-Cross my heart. So, for now, would you mind if I ask you a few more things about the case? (I'd better be careful not to provoke her...) Talk Sorin Phoenix: Could you tell me about Sorin? Ellen: There's nothing to tell! He's squeaky clean! Phoenix: A-All right, okay! (Maybe I should avoid the topic of Sorin right now.) L-Let's talk about something else, then. Ellen: Fine, but you won't hear a peep out of me about Sorin! Phoenix: (Talk about pulling teeth...) Pierce Nichody (appears after \"Sorin\") Phoenix: Could you tell me about Pierce Nichody, then? Ellen: Pierce... He came to Sprocket Manor about a year ago. As the family butler, he's now in charge of everything in the household. Phoenix: Only a year ago? Did he have some kind of special connection with the family? Ellen: I'm just a maid, so I'm not privy to such things, I'm afraid. Phoenix: (It might've been Sorin's order, but Pierce is the one who coordinated the whole thing. He's the one who really orchestrated the grand \"time travel\" farce. He must have quite a bit of authority in that family...) But, no matter how good he is at his job... ...how could anybody gain that much influence in a single year? Ellen: I really don't know... I mean, he IS an excellent butler. Wouldn't that explain it? Phoenix: (Hmm... Is it really as simple as that?) Time travel (appears after \"Pierce Nichody\") Phoenix: What you thought was time travel was really just a cover-up carried out by your in-laws. Pierce said Sorin was the one who ordered the whole thing. Ellen: I still can't believe it. Even if the second reception was fake... ...Sorin would never use time travel for something like that! He's very serious about his time machine research, you know! Phoenix: I heard there's a reason he's researching time machines, actually... ...Something about \"something he wishes he could change\"... But isn't the whole idea of traveling back in time itself a little... fantastic? Ellen: I don't think so! After all, Sorin said real time travelers do exist! Phoenix: Really, now? You think he knows someone who actually traveled through time? Ellen: That's right. I haven't seen it personally, but Sorin said as much... ...so I believe it. Phoenix: (Somebody who actually traveled through time, huh? It's pretty hard to believe...) Thank you, Ellen. Ellen: You're going out to do your investigation now, aren't you? Phoenix: Yes, that's right. Ellen: Please make sure you don't cause Sorin any trouble, okay? Phoenix: I'm afraid... I can't promise you that. Ellen: Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?! Please! Whatever you do! Please don't upset my poor Sorin any further! I'm begging you! Phoenix: I-I'll do my best to not cause him any unnecessary trouble. Ellen: Ooh, I couldn't bear it if Sorin ever came under suspicion! I'd rather be found guilty myseeeeeeeelf! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Phoenix: Yikes! Ellen, please! Don't work yourself up like this! You don't want Sorin to worry, do you? Ellen: N-No. You're right... Phoenix: (And the flood waters recede once more...) Maya: So what do we do now, Nick? Phoenix: Well, Ellen said Sorin is usually in meetings until the evening, so... ...let's save our house call until then. Why don't we go to the mooring dock and figure out our next move from there? Maya: Roger, Nick! Time travel (subsequent times) Phoenix: What you thought was time travel was really just a cover-up carried out by your in-laws. Pierce said Sorin was the one who ordered the whole thing. Ellen: I still can't believe it. Even if the second reception was fake... ...Sorin would never use time travel for something like that! He's very serious about his time machine research, you know! Phoenix: I heard there's a reason he's researching time machines, actually... ...Something about \"something he wishes he could change\"... But isn't the whole idea of traveling back in time itself a little... fantastic? Ellen: I don't think so! After all, Sorin said real time travelers do exist! Phoenix: Really, now? You think he knows someone who actually traveled through time? Ellen: That's right. I haven't seen it personally, but Sorin said as much... ...so I believe it. Phoenix: (Somebody who actually traveled through time, huh? It's pretty hard to believe...) After clearing \"Time travel\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: September 22Sprocket Park - Mooring Dock Phoenix: So, where should we start? Maya: Hmm... Let's see. Are there any places we haven't examined yet? We already investigated the reception hall, and Sprocket Manor... Phoenix: ...I know! We haven't looked at the vista deck or the hold yet! Maya: Hey, you're right! We've still got some pretty important places left to examine, don't we! The vista deck is the actual scene of the murder, right? Phoenix: And the lantern with the body in it was stored in the hold. I think there's a good chance we'll find some important clues in those locations. Maya: Do we know how to get to the hold? Phoenix: Good question. I think it was labeled in that diagram of the airship in this pamphlet. Maya: There it is! Phoenix: Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go! Examine Mooring tower Maya: So that one little tower is all that's keeping the airship from being blown away? Phoenix: Apparently. It must be sturdier than it looks. Maya: You know what it reminds me of? A single mom raising three kids while holding down a full-time job! Phoenix: S-Sure... (Where did that analogy even come from...?) Bench Phoenix: A strong wind blew this bench straight through the air, apparently. Maya: It looks like they fixed the sign, but left the bench right where it landed. I wonder why. Phoenix: Maybe the repair guy just hasn't gotten around to it yet. September 22Flying Chapel - Hold Phoenix: So this is the hold... (This is where Pierce orchestrated the whole cover-up operation... We'd better go over this place with a fine-tooth comb.) Maya: Hey, Nick...? Weren't we supposed to need a key card to get in here? Phoenix: Huh, you're right. I wonder why it was unlocked? ???: How's it going, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Ema! What are you doing here? Ema: Just a little independent investigating, for my own sake. Gotta keep the mind sharp! Phoenix: (Ah, so the door's security system was turned off for the police investigation.) We'd like to investigate the hold ourselves. Would that be all right? Ema: Yeah, sure. The police just finished their examination anyway. Phoenix: Thanks. We'll just take a quick look around, then. Ema: Oh, right! You should know that the floor doubles as a huge lift. You can use that lever way back there to raise it up to the vista deck. The police inspected it already, but didn't find anything of particular interest, it seems. If you do go up to the vista deck with the lift, be careful not to fall off! Phoenix: Got it. Thanks. Ema: That goes double for you, Maya! Maya: Yes, ma'am! Phoenix: Well, let's get this show on the road. Examine Engine or \"VISTA DECK\" sign Phoenix: So this is the airship's engine. It's pretty impressive. Maya: And it's all rhythmic, like a heartbeat! It's the literal heart of the Flying Chapel! Look at all those huge gears spinning around and around and around and around and... Ulp! I think I'm starting to get dizzy... Phoenix: Yeah... Me, too... Glassware Phoenix: These must be the dishes and glasses they use for receptions. Very fancy. I bet we'd be in big trouble if we broke any of them. Maya: Ooh! I wanna see, Nick! Phoenix: You, young lady, need to stay far, far away from them. Maya: Nick! You think I'm going to break them, don't you?! Phoenix: Let's just say your rap sheet for breaking things doesn't help your case. Flowers Maya: These are the flowers we saw in Larry's photo! Phoenix: The petals make them look like little gears. The perfect flower for the Sprocket family, huh? Maybe they were going to shower the couple with the petals? Maya: You mean, kind of like how people throw rice or confetti? Phoenix: Yeah, like that. Only, these were found at the scene of a murder instead... Model plane Maya: Ooh, look, Nick! It's an airplane! Phoenix: I wonder if Sorin built that one, too. Maya: Hey, why don't we take it for a spin? Just a quick tour around the neighborhood! Phoenix: And who do you propose is going to pilot that wooden deathtrap? Maya: Me, of course! Who else? Don't worry. I've seen people fly airplanes on TV plenty of times. Phoenix: Um... I think I'll pass. (I've still got my whole life ahead of me!) Bell Phoenix: What's that? A wedding bell? Maya: According to the pamphlet... ...it's used on the vista deck during wedding ceremonies to bless the newlyweds. Phoenix: I guess they disassemble and store it away here in the hold when it's not being used. Cake Maya: Ooh, it's a cake, Nick! A cake! It's so big, they wouldn't miss one little piece, would they? Phoenix: If you're that in the mood for a mouthful of styrofoam, knock yourself out. Maya: You mean it's not real...? Well, it sure fooled me... I was so ready to have some that I'm really craving cake now... Come on, Nick! Let's go get some! Phoenix: Maybe after the trial is over... Pegacow lanterns Phoenix: So there are two male Pegabull lanterns in the reception hall. That must mean... ...that these two are female Pegacow lanterns. Maya: Larry got their sexes mixed up when he replaced the one in the reception hall, huh? Didn't he see the horns? The difference is pretty glaring, if you ask me. Phoenix: And yet he managed not to notice. That's what makes Larry Larry. (And Larry being Larry is why I've seen more than my fair share of trouble for a lifetime...) Ema: Oh, Mr. Wright...? You know that lantern the victim was found inside of in the reception hall...? I'm just about to go piece it back together so the police can examine it. Phoenix: Oh? Okay. We'll stop by for a look, too, once you're done fixing it. Lever Phoenix: Oh, look. There's the lever to the lift Ema told us about. Maya: Let's try going up on it! I'll go flip the switch. Here goes nothing! Phoenix: Wait! I'm not even on it yet! H-Hey, Maya! Stop the lift! Maya: Whoops, sorry! I got a little carried away! Phoenix: Never mind that. Move over a little! Maya: O-Okay... Phoenix: Is that... blood? Ema: B-Blood? Let me see! Phoenix: Could it be Mr. Gloomsbury's blood? Ema: Well, this lift goes up to the vista deck where the murder took place, so... ...I think that's the most logical conclusion. Phoenix: (But I thought the victim was clubbed to death and that there wasn't much blood...? Something tells me I'd better take a picture of this...) Lift Bloodstain added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (I should ask Ema about it some more later.) Maya, can you bring the lift back down now? Maya: You got it! I'll go flip the switch again! There! Done! Phoenix: I want to find out some more about that bloodstain... But, for now, I guess we should go up to the vista deck... ...and take a look around the actual crime scene for ourselves. Maya: The view must be great from up there! I bet it'll be awesome! Phoenix: ...You mean, it would be, if it wasn't the scene of a murder... Maya: Okay! To the vista deck we go! Make sure you actually get ON the lift this time, Nick! Phoenix: I know, I know. Maya: Okay, I'll just flip the switch again, and... awaaaay we go! Maya: Wow! Look at the gorgeous view! Phoenix: So this is where Ellen was attacked, and Mr. Gloomsbury was killed... Yeesh. One wrong step, and it's \"kersplat!\" on the ground below. Maya: Should we go investigate the stuff that's a little closer to the edge? Phoenix: Well, I don't see much of anything over there. The police investigation didn't turn up any clues either, so... Maybe we don't need to? Maya: Oh, I get it! You're SCARED, aren't you, Nick? Phoenix: O-Of course not! C'mon, let's go back down and finish checking out the hold! Lever (subsequent times) Phoenix: It's the lever for the lift... What should we do? Go up to the vista deck Phoenix: Let's go up to the vista deck again. Maya: Okey-dokey! Aaaand up we go! Phoenix: Ugh... Well, I guess there really isn't anything to see up here... Let's go back down to the hold. Maya: But we just got here! Let's enjoy the view a little more! Phoenix: Time's a-wasting! L-Let's go, Maya! Maya: Aww... Leads back to examination Check out the bloodstain Phoenix: Maya, could you operate the lift for me? I want to see that bloodstain again. Maya: You got it! I just have to stop it partway up, right? So, first I'll throw the switch... there! Then, I'll press stop! Phoenix: Yeah... That's quite a bit of blood, all right. It's dry, but it doesn't look all that old. Maya: Do you think it's from the murder? Phoenix: I think so, but I'd need more info to be sure. Could you bring the lift back down now? Maya: Aye-aye, sir! Leads back to examination Leave it alone Phoenix: We'd better just leave it alone. Maya: Awwwww! I wanted to throw the switch! Phoenix: Maybe later... Leads back to examination Candelabra Phoenix: Huh? It looks like there are some fingerprints on this candelabra. Ema: Yeah. I just got done dusting that. I was able to pull a set of left hand prints. Phoenix: Do you know whose prints they are? Ema: Yes. The prints belong to the victim, Dumas Gloomsbury. Maya: Nick! I just figured out something amazing! Phoenix: You did? Maya: Get this -- if the fingerprints on the candelabra were from his left hand... ...then Mister Doom-n'-Gloom must've been... left-handed! What do you think of that? Do I have the makings of a great detective, or what? Phoenix: (You're a real silly Sally if you thought THAT deduction was in any way Encyclopedic...) (Changed from [Oh, yes. Your deductive reasoning skills are nearly Encyclopedic...] in the original release) Ema: Hey, you're pretty good, Maya! I looked into it myself, and sure enough, the victim really was left-handed. Maya: Really? I got it right? Awesome! Phoenix: Uh, good for you, Maya. Maya: \"Good for you\"? That's all you've got to say? Phoenix: I, uh, think you did a real great job, Maya. Way to go! (I guess one can never have too much info...) Maya: Now you're talking! Heh heh heh! Phoenix: But, come to think of it... ...this candelabra isn't in the photo Larry took of the hold, is it? Maya: That picture was taken when they were getting ready for the first reception, right? The candelabra must've been brought in here sometime after that, then. Phoenix: Hmm... It's still possible it has something to do with the incident, though. I'd better add it to the evidence file, just in case. Candelabra added to the Court Record. Ema: Oh, by the way, Mr. Wright... You can have this fingerprint powder, if you like. Phoenix: You're giving this to us? Ema: Sure. I have four other sets. Phoenix: Th-Thanks... (I feel like there's something more to the candelabra, but I can't put my finger on it...) Candelabra (subsequent times) Maya: I wonder where they sell candelabras like these... Phoenix: What, are you looking to buy some? Maya: I was thinking they'd be perfect for the altar candles in the Channeling Chamber at home. It might class up the place a little! Phoenix: I dunno... I can't really see them fitting in with the vibe of Kurain Village... Talk The incident Phoenix: Any progress with your investigation? Ema: Nothing conclusive yet, I'm afraid. Almost everybody was involved with the cover-up... ...so it's hard to know who or what to believe. Phoenix: I know what you mean. Ema: Unless you have some compelling evidence, I'm afraid it's going to be a tough trial for you. Phoenix: You're telling me... There isn't much time left, so I've just got to make do and see what I can turn up. The candelabra (appears after examining candelabra) Phoenix: Ema, can we check out this candelabra a little more? Ema: A little more? What do you-- Oops! Phoenix: Wh-What happened?! Ema: I almost dropped the candelabra, and the candles slipped off. Phoenix: Well, let's be careful with that. It might be important evidence. Ema: Wait a minute... Phoenix: Now what? Ema: One of the pins that hold the candles is broken. Phoenix: What? Ema: There's definitely something fishy about this candelabra! Phoenix: There is? What makes you say that? Ema: Call it forensic investigator's intuition! We already dusted this for prints earlier... ...so let's test it with luminol this time! Phoenix: (Knowing Ema, she'd use every test she has at the same time if she could...) Ema: Just hang on. This will only take a second. Phoenix: (I hope this turns up a new lead somehow...) Well, Ema? Did you find anything? Ema: Take a look at this, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: What is all that blood doing on there?! Candelabra updated in the Court Record. Ema: Maybe somebody got hurt while they were setting up for the reception? These pins are pretty sharp. Phoenix: But if one of the pins is broken... ...it means there was some force involved. Do you think maybe somebody got stabbed? Ema: B-But nobody reported anything like that... Phoenix: (That's quite a bit of blood. I wonder whose it is... If I have anything that might shed some light on that, I should probably show it to Ema...) The candelabra (subsequent times) Phoenix: Ema, can we check out this candelabra a little more? Ema: A little more? What do you-- Oops! Phoenix: Wh-What happened?! Ema: I almost dropped the candelabra, and the candles slipped off. Phoenix: Well, let's be careful with that. It might be important evidence. Ema: Wait a minute... Phoenix: Now what? Ema: One of the pins that hold the candles is broken. Phoenix: What? Ema: There's definitely something fishy about this candelabra! Phoenix: There is? What makes you say that? Ema: Call it forensic investigator's intuition! We already dusted this for prints earlier... ...so let's test it with luminol this time! Phoenix: (Knowing Ema, she'd use every test she has at the same time if she could...) Ema: Just hang on. This will only take a second. Phoenix: (I hope this turns up a new lead somehow...) Well, Ema? Did you find anything? Ema: Take a look at this, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: What is all that blood doing on there?! Ema: Maybe somebody got hurt while they were setting up for the reception? These pins are pretty sharp. Phoenix: But if one of the pins is broken... ...it means there was some force involved. Do you think maybe somebody got stabbed? Ema: B-But nobody reported anything like that... Phoenix: (That's quite a bit of blood. I wonder whose it is... If I have anything that might shed some light on that, I should probably show it to Ema...) The bloodstain (appears after presenting Lift Bloodstain; before clearing \"The candelabra\" Talk option) Phoenix: Ema, about this bloodstain... Ema: I'm thinking it's probably the victim's blood. Phoenix: But the victim was clubbed to death, right? Ema: Yeah, but he could've been bleeding from his nose, or maybe he spat it out. I won't really know for sure until I look into it some more. Phoenix: I see. (There's still something about it that bothers me, though...) The bloodstain (appears after presenting Lift Bloodstain; after clearing \"The candelabra\" Talk option) Phoenix: About this bloodstain... Ema: What about it? Phoenix: There's something about it that's been bothering me. Ema: Oh, yeah? What's that? Phoenix: Well, there's a huge bloodstain on the crime scene lift, and a bloodstained candelabra... Now, this is only a guess, but I'm thinking maybe these two bloodstains are from... The same source Leads to: \"I'm thinking maybe these two bloodstains are from the same source.\" Different sources Phoenix: I'm thinking maybe these two bloodstains are from completely different sources. Ema: Yes, that's what I'm thinking, too. So, what about it? Phoenix: (Oh, hmm... Being in agreement won't lead us anywhere new... I need to find out more about these bloodstains somehow...) Sorry! That's not what I meant to say... Leads to: \"I'm thinking maybe these two bloodstains are from the same source.\" Phoenix: I'm thinking maybe these two bloodstains are from the same source. Ema: Hmm... I guess that IS a possibility. Phoenix: Can we compare the two bloodstains? Would that take a lot of time? Ema: Are you kidding? Don't underestimate the power of science! It'll be done in a jiffy! Ema: And the results are in! That didn't take long, now, did it? Hmm... It seems that the blood from the lift and candelabra are from the same person. Lift Bloodstain updated in the Court Record. Candelabra updated in the Court Record. Phoenix: Well, the victim was clubbed to death, and there wasn't all that much blood... Ema: But if this isn't Mr. Gloomsbury's blood... Phoenix: Well, this is just a guess, but... ...what if Mr. Gloomsbury stabbed somebody with the candelabra pin? That would explain both the huge bloodstain on the lift and the blood on the candelabra. Ema: Oh, my goodness! If that's true... ...then that means there was somebody else present at the scene of the murder! Phoenix: It does, doesn't it? (This just might substantiate Ellen's statement about a third person!) Ema, could you have this blood analyzed? Ema: Sure thing! The bloodstain (after clearing \"The candelabra\" Talk option; subsequent times) Phoenix: About this bloodstain... Ema: What about it? Phoenix: There's something about it that's been bothering me. Ema: Oh, yeah? What's that? Phoenix: Well, there's a huge bloodstain on the crime scene lift, and a bloodstained candelabra... Now, this is only a guess, but I'm thinking maybe these two bloodstains are from...

Ema, could you have this blood analyzed? Ema: Sure thing! Present Lift Bloodstain Phoenix: Ema, about this bloodstain... Doesn't something about it strike you as odd? Ema: What's so odd about the victim's blood? Phoenix: That's not exactly... There's just something about it that bothers me. Ema: Hmm... Now that you mention it... ...I can't say I necessarily disagree with you. Phoenix: (Maybe I should talk about this some more with her...) After clearing \"The incident\" Talk option, correctly clearing \"The bloodstain\" Talk option, and examining Pegacow lanterns: Phoenix: Hmm... A mysterious bloodstain on a candelabra with the victim's prints on it... This just might be the thing to back up Ellen's memory of seeing a third person. Next up, the reception hall. It might be worth taking another look around in there. Ema: The reception hall? The forensics team is in there investigating right now. Phoenix: Oh, they are? Maya: Well, we don't have time to just sit around, so let's go check out something else! Phoenix: Good idea. We could go question some people. (Especially Sorin. I have quite a few questions for that guy.) Maya: Sounds good, Nick! Ema: Off to do some legwork, then? Phoenix: Yup. I thought we'd head to Sorin's house for starters. Ema: He was accompanying the police on their investigation here earlier, but... ...he's probably home by now. Phoenix: Great, thanks. Later, Ema. Wright Anything Agency or Mooring Dock Present Lift Bloodstain Phoenix: To think they fought for their lives here, on what was supposed to be an uplifting day... Maya: Nick! You do realize this a murder case, right?! Phoenix: Huh? D-Did I say something wrong? Maya; What are you thinking, making such an insensitive pun about this lift?! Phoenix: (What pun? All I said was that it was supposed to be an uplifting day... Oh. Th-That wasn't supposed to be a pun!) Maya: I strongly suggest you don't say anything like that in front of the Sprocket family! Phoenix: Y-Yes, ma'am... Candelabra Maya: That's quite a fancy candelabra, huh? Maybe I should get a few just like it for the altar in the Channeling Chamber at home. Phoenix: I can't really see these things going well with the vibe of Kurain Village... Maya: But they're perfect! They can even hold the really big candles! And they look so cool, too! Phoenix: (That's going to be one eclectic altar once Maya's done redecorating...) September 22Sprocket Manor - Foyer Maya: I still can't get over how gorgeous Sprocket Manor is! Phoenix: Just don't touch anything. Maya: I--! I wasn't going to! Phoenix: (She was DEFINITELY going to...) ???: I was told I had guests... Phoenix: Thank you for seeing us, Sorin. We know you're busy. We'd like to ask you a few questions about the case, if you wouldn't mind. Sorin: ............ Phoenix: Um... Sorin? Sorin: You're Ellen's lawyer, right? Phoenix: Huh...? Y-Yes, that's right. (Don't tell me he doesn't remember me...?) Sorin: ...Will Ellen be found guilty? Phoenix: We're doing everything we can to prevent that. That's why we're here, investigating. Will you please tell us what you know? Sorin: ............ Phoenix: Sorin...? Sorin: .........All right. Fine. Phoenix: (What was that pause all about?) Examine Photos on table Man: Aha! Come back to hear more about my camera, have you? Phoenix: I-I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I'm really busy right now. Man: Oh. What a shame. Well, if you ever want to talk about cameras, come back and see me anytime. Phoenix: (Sounds like even his own family members don't want to listen to him...) Bouquet Maya: Hey, Nick! Better watch out, or you'll be cursed by the bouquet of woe. Phoenix: Oh, come on, Maya. Like I'm going to believe an urban legend you just made up. Talk The cover-up Phoenix: It was you who gave the order for that large-scale cover-up plan, isn't that right? Sorin: What \"large-scale cover-up\"...? Maya: Don't play dumb with us! You held two wedding receptions in order to try and cover up Mr. Gloomsbury's murder! Phoenix: Ellen thought that, through the power of the Time Keeper you built... ...she traveled back in time. Sorin: Ah... So that's why there were two receptions... Phoenix: (Wait, does he seriously not know why the reception was held twice? Looks like I'll have to delve deeper here...) Time travel (appears after \"The cover-up\") Phoenix: So, the cover-up scheme -- that fake trip through time... ...you're not the one who was behind it all? Pierce Nichody stated in court that you were the one who ordered it to be carried out. Sorin: Pierce said that...? I see. I leave him in charge of everything around me. So whatever he decides is, in essence, my decision, too. Phoenix: So I take it that you didn't know anything about the cover-up? Sorin: ......That's none of your business. Phoenix: But you were in two wedding receptions in a row! And still, you claim to know nothing? Sorin: ...I have nothing more to say to you. Please leave. Phoenix: B-But, Sorin...! Ow! Maya: Oh, there's something written on this paper airplane! Let's see... \"Go away!\" Phoenix: It doesn't get clearer than that, huh... (He's looking especially uncooperative, but... ...maybe I can grab his attention somehow. There's still that one piece of evidence I don't know much about... It's worth a try...) Present Selena Sprocket Photo Sorin: Sis... Phoenix: I'm sure your sister would want the truth of this case to be known. Sorin: ...How rude. Is intruding on the private lives of others... ...a part of your job as a lawyer? Phoenix: Oh... I, uh... I apologize. (I guess showing him the picture of his sister wasn't such a good idea after all.) Candelabra (after clearing \"Time travel\" Talk option) Leads to: \"Sorin, have you ever seen this before?\" Phoenix: Sorin, have you ever seen this before? Sorin: Th-That's... That's...! Phoenix: Sorin, what is it? Sorin: N-Nothing...! Phoenix: (Why did his whole demeanor change all of a sudden? He's gone pale as a ghost, too...) *thud* Phoenix: S-Sorin! Maya: Nick! Look at his stomach! He's bleeding! Phoenix: S-Somebody, help! Sorin's collapsed! Maid: Master Sorin! Relative: Get him to the hospital! Quickly, now! Maya: Poor Sorin... That must be one serious wound... Phoenix: Hmm... Maya: What is it, Nick? Phoenix: Well, when I showed him the candelabra, his whole demeanor changed... So I was just thinking that maybe his injury is... Maya: Huh? What's this? Phoenix: It's Sorin's notebook. He must've dropped it in the rush to get him to the hospital. Maya: Ooh, his notebook, huh...? I wonder what's written in it. Don't you? Come on! You know you wanna take a peek! Phoenix: Sorin's notebook... What to do, what to do...? Take a peek Leads to: \"I feel guilty, snooping around in somebody's personal notebook, but...\" Don't look Phoenix: I really don't think we should... Maya: But it might have some really, really, REALLY important information in it! Phoenix: Yes, that's quite possible, but still... (Well, I guess it IS for Ellen's sake, at the end of the day...) Leads to: \"I feel guilty, snooping around in somebody's personal notebook, but...\" Phoenix: I feel guilty, snooping around in somebody's personal notebook, but... ...maybe we SHOULD take a little look-see. Whoa! It's filled with big words written in tiny letters! I guess he uses this notebook to write down his invention ideas? ...Huh? Maya: What is it? Did you find something? Phoenix: Hmm... After March 8th of last year, the content of this notebook changes dramatically. Maya: Like how? Phoenix: Well... Ever since that date, Sorin's been writing down every detail of his life. As in EVERY. Maya: Maybe he decided to start keeping a diary? Phoenix: But this is way too detailed to be an ordinary diary. Maya: Hmm... Either he's really compulsive... ...or maybe just plain forgetful. Phoenix: (But is it really as simple as that...?) I feel like something happened on March 8th that made Sorin change. Maya: Well, why don't you let me take a look at that, and I'll tell you! Phoenix: H-Hey! Maya! Let go or we'll rip it! Maya: Eep! Now look what you did! You dropped it! You should've just let me take a look! Phoenix: (How is this MY fault...?) Maya: Oh, no! Nick... Phoenix: Ack! It fell into that pool of Sorin's blood! I can't read a thing on these two pages now... Maya: Uh-oh! You're gonna get it now! Phoenix: (Ugh... I guess it really is my fault after all...) Let's just put it away carefully for now. We can't let anything else happen to it, you hear? Sorin's Notebook added to the Court Record. Maya: Huh? Hey look, there's something sticking out of the notebook. It looks like a newspaper article. Phoenix: Let's see... It's about the car accident Sorin's sister died in! It happened on... March 8th... That's the day Sorin's notebook completely changed... Oh, wow! Maya: Wh-What else does it say?! Phoenix: It says the driver at the time of the accident was... Dumas Gloomsbury. It says Sorin was in the car, too, and that he had sustained severe injuries. It's just like Pierce said. Sorin completely changed after the accident. Newspaper Article added to the Court Record. Phoenix: So Gloomsbury was driving the car when they got into that accident... That opens up the distinct possibility... Maya: Of...? Phoenix: Of Sorin holding a grudge against Gloomsbury. Maya: You think Sorin could've...? Phoenix: I don't know. It's not like I have any proof... We should talk to Pierce about this when we return Sorin's notebook to him. ...Though he doesn't seem to be here right now. Maybe he's at the Flying Chapel. Wright Anything Agency or Reception Hall Present Sorin's Notebook Maya: Oh, it's the notebook you dropped! Phoenix: The notebook \"I\" dropped?! It only ended up where it did because you tried to snatch it out of my hands! Maya: Well... maybe I was a TINY bit complicit in it... Look! No one's to blame here, right? It was just an accident! Right?! Phoenix: Oh, I think we both know who's more to blame... Newspaper Article Maya: This is about the car accident Sorin's sister died in... I bet she would've wanted to see her little brother get married... Phoenix: Yeah... But with the way things are, I don't think she'll be able to rest in peace. So we'll just have to figure out the truth somehow... For her sake, too. Maya: Yeah. Let's not leave a single stone unturned and push on in our investigation! September 22Sprocket Park - Mooring Dock Phoenix: I sure hope Pierce is around here somewhere. ???: Ah, Mr. Wright and Ms. Fey. Phoenix: Hello, Pierce. We were just looking for you. Nichody: I'm sorry for Master Sorin's sudden departure earlier. You have my sincerest apologies. Phoenix: It was totally understandable, really. But shouldn't you be at his side right now? Nichody: It's fine. The other servants are with him, and I am in constant contact with them. Do not forget to give him his pain medication, and be sure to keep him hydrated. Also, see to it that he is not up and about. He needs complete bed rest. Phoenix: (Is this what happens when you're too rich for normal, peasant phones...?) Nichody: I must return to Master Sorin now, but... ...did you want something of me? Phoenix: Actually, here's Sorin's notebook. He dropped it when he collapsed. (I hope Pierce doesn't notice the bloodstain!) Nichody: Oh. Thank you very much for this. I will see to it personally that Master Sorin gets it back. Phoenix: Thank you. Sorin's Notebook given to Pierce. Nichody: I trust you did not look inside? Phoenix: Oh, of course not! Aha ha! Nichody: Because it is filled with numerous patent-worthy ideas, you see. Phoenix: Look, I know you're busy, but would you mind if I asked you a few questions about the case? Nichody: Well, as I said, I must be getting back to Master Sorin. So if you could make it quick, I would greatly appreciate it. Phoenix: All right. I'll make this as quick as I can. Talk The cover-up Phoenix: I'd like to ask you about the cover-up you tried to pull off, if you don't mind. Nichody: I told everything there is to tell in court already. Disposing of anything that may harm the Sprocket family's reputation... ...is simply a part of my job. Phoenix: (Sounds like a lovely job description...) Nichody: I have nothing more to say on the matter. I will say, I do not think it's wise to spend time on topics that have already been discussed. Phoenix: Right. The accident (appears after \"The cover-up\") Phoenix: Pierce, could you tell us more about this accident? Nichody: Where did you find that...? And did I not already tell you about that accident? Phoenix: You did, but you conveniently left out one crucial detail: The fact that Dumas Gloomsbury was driving the car at the time. Nichody: Oh? Did I not mention that? I suppose it simply did not come up then. Phoenix: If Mr. Gloomsbury caused the accident... ...why didn't the Sprocket family fire him? Wouldn't that usually be the natural consequence of such a huge mistake? Nichody: Please do not misunderstand. Gloomsbury stayed on with the family... ...on Master Sorin's request. Phoenix: (What...?) Nichody: That is the type of person Master Sorin is. Perhaps it was the influence of Miss Selena's kind nature. She was such a sweet person that even in her last moments, she thought of Master Sorin. Phoenix: (Not only did Sorin NOT hold a grudge against Gloomsbury, he insisted on keeping him on. Now I REALLY don't understand how that guy's mind works...) Selena's last moments (appears after \"The accident\") Phoenix: So you were present for Selena Sprocket's last moments...? Nichody: Yes, in my professional capacity... The accident happened on the way to a certain party. Phoenix: And what kind of a party was it? Nichody: It was Miss Selena's engagement party. Gloomsbury's injuries were minor, but Miss Selena's and Master Sorin's were critical. They were brought to the Sprocket family's regular hospital. Phoenix: (Wow... To have such a terrible thing happen on what was to be a day of celebration...) Nichody: Thanks to the surgeon in charge, Master Sorin pulled through. But Miss Selena... She... Phoenix: ............ Nichody: The last words Miss Selena said to me were... \"Please help Sorin.\" Nichody: Ever since then, I have attended Master Sorin and tried to help him in any way I can. Phoenix: I see... Selena's fianc\u00e9 must have been devastated. Nichody: Indeed. The shock of losing Miss Selena was so great, he quit being a surgeon. Phoenix: He was a surgeon? Wait... So the surgeon who tried to save them both, was he...? Nichody: Yes, he was Miss Selena's fianc\u00e9. Maya: What a terrible tragedy... Phoenix: How awful... So where is her fianc\u00e9 now? Nichody: ...Good question. I wonder that sometimes myself. Phoenix: (So Selena had a fianc\u00e9... I'd like to find out more about him, but I doubt I'll find him any time soon.) Nichody: So, are we done here? I'm afraid I must be going. Phoenix: Could you please just tell me... ...a little more about Sorin? Nichody: There is nothing more to tell. Phoenix: (I can't seem to get any real answers out of him just by asking him questions. But there IS that piece of evidence I still don't know much about... Maybe he'll be able to tell me something about it.) Selena's last moments (subsequent times) Phoenix: So you were present for Selena Sprocket's last moments...? Nichody: Yes, in my professional capacity... The accident happened on the way to a certain party. Phoenix: And what kind of a party was it? Nichody: It was Miss Selena's engagement party. Gloomsbury's injuries were minor, but Miss Selena's and Master Sorin's were critical. They were brought to the Sprocket family's regular hospital. Phoenix: (Wow...

Pierce's secret (appears after correctly presenting Candelabra) Phoenix: Pierce. You're hiding something from me about this candelabra, aren't you? Nichody: It is one of the candelabras from the Flying Chapel, is it not? Is there something special about it? 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (My magatama is definitely reacting. I guess I'll just have to break those Psyche-Locks and find out what he's got to hide!) Present Magatama Phoenix: 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Pierce's Secret -- Phoenix: Pierce. You're hiding something from me about this candelabra, aren't you? Nichody: It is one of the candelabras from the Flying Chapel, is it not? Is there something special about it?

Present Sorin Sprocket profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Sorin has a rather nasty wound on his body, doesn't he?\" Present anyone else Phoenix: Nichody: What does that person have to do with it?

Leads back to: \"I think the blood might belong to this person.\" Phoenix: Sorin has a rather nasty wound on his body, doesn't he? Nichody: Ngh... 1 LOCK BROKEN Nichody: Yes, Master Sorin is indeed injured. Phoenix: Are any of the other people involved with this case injured? Nichody: N-Not as far as I know... Phoenix: ...I see. Then, let me ask you this, Pierce. Do you suppose Sorin could have been more directly involved than you're letting on? Nichody: Wh-What in the world would make you think that...? Phoenix: Oh, I've got my reasons. Mr. Gloomsbury's fingerprints were found on this candelabra's stem. Which leads me to believe that Mr. Gloomsbury stabbed Sorin with it. Nichody: You cannot possibly think Master Sorin is the one responsible for the murder. Phoenix: I don't have any conclusive evidence of that at the moment... ...but I do think he had a motive. This proves that Sorin had a motive to kill Mr. Gloomsbury. Present Newspaper Article Phoenix: Leads to: \"Even though it was an accident...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Nichody: How does that prove that Master Sorin had a motive to commit the murder? Phoenix: Huh? (Wrong piece, I guess!) Never mind that. I didn't mean it! Nichody: My time is limited, Mr. Wright, so please do hurry. Leads back to: \"This proves that Sorin had a motive to kill Mr. Gloomsbury.\" Phoenix: Even though it was an accident... ...Mr. Gloomsbury was the man responsible for taking Sorin's sister away. 1 LOCK BROKEN Nichody: Let us suppose... that Gloomsbury did stab Master Sorin with the candelabra... Can you prove that it had anything to do with this case? He might have been stabbed at some other location, for some other reason... Phoenix: Sorry, but I can prove it WAS related to this case. Nichody: Oh, really? Phoenix: Sorin's stabbing and Mr. Gloomsbury's death are definitely connected. Nichody: Are they now...?

Do not detain me with nonsense any longer... Leads back to: \"This is the piece of evidence that ties Sorin's injury to Mr. Gloomsbury's murder.\" Phoenix: A bloodstain was found on the side of the lift that goes between the hold and vista deck. Its blood matches the blood that's on the candelabra. I obtained the results straight from the police, so I can assure you this information is correct. Nichody: ............ Phoenix: This bloodstain on the lift indicates an important fact. It shows us that... The murder was in the reception hall Phoenix: The true scene of the murder was in the reception hall. Nichody: ............ ............ ............ ............ Phoenix: All right, so I kinda just said the first thing that popped into my mind... ...but now that I think about it, I take it back.

Nichody: How does the bloodstain on the lift tell you that? Phoenix: Well, er... I guess it really doesn't, does it? Nichody: If you insist on speaking nonsense, I will have to ask you to let me leave. Phoenix: N-No more nonsense this time! I promise! Leads back to: \"This bloodstain on the lift indicates an important fact. It shows us that...\" Phoenix: Sorin's blood is on the lift, which can only mean one thing. He was there, wasn't he? Sorin was at the scene of the crime. Nichody: You are very astute, Mr. Wright. It appears I cannot hide this from you any longer. Very well. I will tell you everything. 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Pierce's secret (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Leads to: \"Could you tell me about Sorin's injury?\" Present Selena Sprocket Photo Nichody: I hope you will refrain from showing this to Master Sorin. He is still suffering the loss of Miss Selena. Phoenix: B-But... Nichody: I do not believe rubbing salt in people's wounds is part of a lawyer's job. Or am I mistaken? Phoenix: A-All right. I understand. Candelabra or Lift Bloodstain (before clearing \"Selena's last moments\" Talk option) Phoenix: Do you recognize this, Pierce? Nichody: ...It is not really something I care to look at. Phoenix: But it was you and the others who tried to cover things up in the hold, wasn't it? Nichody: I left that entirely to my subordinates, so I really don't know anything about it myself. Phoenix: (Pierce was in charge of handling the guests and relatives... ...so he must know a lot more than he's letting on.) Candelabra (after clearing \"Selena's last moments\" Talk option, before breaking Psyche-Locks) Phoenix: Pierce. Have you ever seen this candelabra before? Nichody: I-I... No, I don't know anything about it... 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (My magatama reacted! Pierce must be trying to hide something from me. I have to break those Psyche-Locks and find out what!) Candelabra (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Phoenix: Sorin was stabbed by Mr. Gloomsbury, right? Nichody: Yes, it is just as I told you earlier. And then, after he had been stabbed, Master Sorin did make his way to the vista deck... But that was after Gloomsbury had been murdered. Phoenix: (Well, it's a fact that Sorin was injured... But now I really don't know what's the truth and what's fiction anymore...) Nichody: It matters not if you believe me or not. If this comes up in court, I will say the same thing to prove Master Sorin's innocence. Phoenix: Well, I guess I'll believe you... for now. Nichody: Heh. Newspaper Article Nichody: Even now, it is painful to remember the accident. And Master Sorin is not the only one who suffers still. The entire Sprocket family was plunged into deep sorrow. A sorrow they still feel to this day. Phoenix: (Now I can understand why Sorin changed so much after the accident...) Nichody: That is why I do not want you to bring up the car accident again. I hope you understand. Phoenix: Y-Yes, I understand. (So I guess that topic is out...) Phoenix: Could you tell me about Sorin's injury? Nichody: ...Very well. This is what I heard directly from Master Sorin himself. As you surmised, Master Sorin was stabbed by Gloomsbury on the day of the murder. It happened after the first wedding reception. The happy couple was in the reception hall when, suddenly, Gloomsbury appeared... He attacked Miss Ellen and tried to take her away. Master Sorin went to stop him, and found himself in a struggle with Gloomsbury. That is when Master Sorin was stabbed with the candelabra, he said. Even though Master Sorin was badly injured, he went after Gloomsbury. Phoenix: So Sorin really was at the scene of the murder, wasn't he? Nichody: Yes, that is correct. However, by the time Master Sorin arrived at the scene... ...Gloomsbury had already been murdered. Phoenix: (So Pierce is saying that Sorin WAS at the crime scene... ...but that he didn't have anything to do with the murder itself. Hmm...) Even still, why did you try to keep such an important piece of information from me?! Nichody: I am very sorry. Master Sorin's injury and Gloomsbury's murder were not directly related... ...so I decided not to mention it, so as not to unnecessarily complicate the investigation. ...Now, then. I am sorry, but I am afraid I really must go now. Please excuse me. Phoenix: Thank you for your time. Maya: Pierce should've just told us everything in the first place and saved us all a lot of time! Phoenix: Yeah... But I guess it isn't that simple for him -- he is the family butler, after all. He sure didn't make our job any easier, though, did he? But at least we learned something new. Sorin was at the scene of the crime! Maya: That's true! One step forward is better than none! So, what next, Nick? Phoenix: Hmm... Let's see. The forensics team might be done investigating the reception hall by now. Let's go check it out. Maya: Sounds like a plan! Wright Anything Agency, Foyer, or Hold Talk Any ideas? Phoenix: Is it just me, or does Sorin seem kinda suspicious...? Maya: Yeah... I mean, he's so quiet, who knows what he's thinking, right? And that Pierce isn't exactly an open book, either. It seems like they're both hiding something. Phoenix: Yeah, though that could be true of everyone involved in this case, for all we know. Maya: Hey, I know! Let's make a new rule! The next time anybody lies in court, we get to bop them on the head with the judge's gavel! Phoenix: Sounds more like a game of Whack-A-Mole than a trial to me... Still, I wouldn't necessarily say no... What to do Maya: What's wrong, Nick? Phoenix: Oh, I was just thinking about how hard it's been to find out the truth this time around... Maya: What are you talking about? When has it EVER been easy to find out the truth in any of our cases? You just do what you always do! Bluff your way through things, and we'll be fine! Phoenix: (But that's supposed to be my tactic of last resort...) September 22Flying Chapel - Reception Hall Phoenix: It looks like the police are done with their investigation in here. I wonder if it's okay for us to take a look around now. ???: Oh, hi, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Hi, Ema. Would it be all right if we investigate in this room now? Ema: Sure. The police are all done, so go for it. Oh, remember that broken lantern? I restored it to perfection! I have to say, it's some of my best work! Phoenix: (Sounds like the repair job was a resounding success...) Thanks, Ema. We'll take a good look at it, too. Ema: Well, I have to be getting back to the station... Try not to mess up the crime scene if you can help it. Phoenix: We'll be careful. Ema: I'll be seeing you! Maya: Bye, Ema! And thank you! Phoenix: Well, shall we get started? Examine \"EXIT\" door Phoenix: Hey, take a look at that door. I wonder where it goes. Maya: Shall we open it up and see? Maid: Wait! Please don't open that! It's the emergency escape hatch! It leads directly outside! You'll fall to your death! Phoenix: Whew... That was a close one, huh, Maya? Maya: I-I'll say... Fog machine below model plane Maya: Excuse me. Is the fog machine ready to use now? Maid: No, I'm afraid not. We only put dry ice in it when there's an actual reception. Maya: I see... That's too bad... Phoenix: (She still wants to blast me with a cloud of smoke, doesn't she...) Sweetheart area of reception hall Windows Maya: It's another beautiful day outside, isn't it? Phoenix: Yeah. If only it wasn't the scene of a murder, we could really enjoy it... Maya: True... Phoenix: It must be tough for the maids to have to work on a beautiful day like today. Maid: Oh, we don't mind. Phoenix: Whoa! I didn't think you could hear me way over here! Maid: We don't think of it as simply cleaning. It's more like we're wiping away all of the sadness stuck to this airship... Phoenix: (Wow. Talk about devoted...) Sweetheart table Maya: Hey! I think that tablecloth is new. They must've changed it since yesterday! Phoenix: Huh? How can you tell? Maya: Because the food stains that were there are now gone! Phoenix: (I should've known it's because it's food-related...) Smaller table Phoenix: This is where the murder weapon, the Time Keeper, was displayed. I guess it's in police custody now. ...Huh? What's this? A key? Maya: Let's ask the maid about it. Phoenix: Good idea. She might be able to tell us something. Excuse me. Could I ask you a question? Maid: Oh, of course. What would you like to know? Phoenix: Do you know anything about this key? Maid: It's the key that starts up the Time Keeper. Phoenix: A startup key? Maid: That's right. Oh, the First Startup of Love ceremony was so beautiful! The bride and groom each had a symbol of their love, and when they put them together... Oh, how romantic it was! Key of Love added to the Court Record. Phoenix: First Startup of Love ceremony? What exactly did that entail? Maid: Oh, er... It's a ceremony in which the couple activated the Time Keeper together for the first time. I suppose it was kind of like a cake-cutting ceremony. Phoenix: And what are these \"symbols of their love\" you mentioned? Maid: Well... that's kind of an industry secret, so I can't really say. I'm sorry. I'd better be getting back to my work... Phoenix: (Looks like there's an order from above not to talk about it.) Smaller table (subsequent times) Phoenix: This is where the murder weapon, the Time Keeper, was displayed. I guess it's in police custody now. ...Huh? What's this? A key? Maya: Let's ask the maid about it. Phoenix: Good idea. She might be able to tell us something. Excuse me. Could I ask you a question? Maid: Oh, of course. What would you like to know? Phoenix: Do you know anything about this key? Maid: It's the key that starts up the Time Keeper. Phoenix: A startup key? Maid: That's right. Oh, the First Startup of Love ceremony was so beautiful! The bride and groom each had a symbol of their love, and when they put them together... Oh, how romantic it was! Phoenix: First Startup of Love ceremony? What exactly did that entail? Maid: Oh, er... It's a ceremony in which the couple activated the Time Keeper together for the first time. I suppose it was kind of like a cake-cutting ceremony. Phoenix: And what are these \"symbols of their love\" you mentioned? Maid: Well... that's kind of an industry secret, so I can't really say. I'm sorry. I'd better be getting back to my work... Phoenix: (Looks like there's an order from above not to talk about it.) Repaired Pegabull lantern Phoenix: Here's the broken lantern, all patched up. (And I do mean \"patched\"...) Maya: Ema said this was some of her best work, so I know she put a lot of effort into it! Phoenix: It was pretty smashed up. It must've been a lot of work to piece it back together. (Well, she gets an A for effort, at any rate...) ...Huh? This wheel handle on the back has some blood on it! It looks like somebody gripped it with a bloody hand... Maya: Maybe the blood got there when the killer was putting ol' Doom-n'-Gloom's body inside? Do you see anything else worth noting? Phoenix: Well, there's another one of these lanterns over there... ...so it might be a good idea to really compare the two later. Broken Lantern updated in the Court Record. Repaired Pegabull lantern (subsequent times) Maya: Ema must've worked really hard on this. Maid: You mean that police lady? She was going at it like a jigsaw puzzle. All \"Not this piece\" here, \"Not that piece\" there... Phoenix: It was pretty busted up. I can just imagine what a hard time she had figuring it all out. Maya: She should've asked me to help! I would've loved to restore this thing with her! Phoenix: I think it's best to leave that kind of thing to the police. (Besides, who knows what kind of liberties Maya would've taken in the process...?) Intact Pegabull lantern Maya: ...N-Nick! Phoenix: What's wrong, Maya?! Maya: ......This hasn't moved an inch since the last time we looked at it. Phoenix: (It would be pretty creepy if it had...) Look, we're in the middle of an important investigation, so try not to shout, okay? Maya: I was just hoping it had changed somehow. You know, so it would be more interesting. Phoenix: The last thing we need is for things to get more \"interesting.\" Intact Pegabull lantern (after examining repaired Pegabull lantern) Phoenix: This is the unbroken Pegabull lantern. And this is the one that Ema restored. I wouldn't say they look exactly the same... More that they're made up of the same parts. Maya: Wait a minute... Phoenix: What is it, Maya? Maya: I think there's something off about this Pegabull. Phoenix: Just about everything about it looks off to me... Maya: I'm not quite sure what it is, but some detail isn't quite right. Show me the restored lantern again. Phoenix: Hey, I know! It's this, right? Maya: What? Where? Phoenix: The thing about the restored lantern that's off is the... Shape of the horns Phoenix: The shape of the horns is different, isn't it? How they're curved, and their size, and stuff? Maya: I don't know... The curve and size seem the same as the unbroken one to me. Phoenix: Yeah, I guess you're right. They're pretty much identical, huh. In that case... Leads back to: \"The thing about the restored lantern that's off is the...\" Angle of the wings Phoenix: I've got it! The angle of that wing is different. And it's attached all wrong! Maya: Well duh, Nick! I could've told you THAT! I mean there's something more subtle... Something that feels just slightly off. You know what I mean? Phoenix: (No, not really... Still, maybe it's...) Leads back to: \"The thing about the restored lantern that's off is the...\" Color of the wheel handle Leads to: \"Look. It's the wheel handle. It's a different color altogether.\" Phoenix: Look. It's the wheel handle. It's a different color altogether. Ema got the inside and outside wheel handles switched around. Maya: Oh, wow! You're right! And there's blood here on this handle -- as if somebody gripped it with a bloody hand. Phoenix: Right. Which means that the blood got on the handle from inside the lantern. Broken Lantern updated in the Court Record. Maya: Do you think the blood got there when the killer was putting the body in the lantern? Phoenix: Hmm... It's really hard to say, at this point. Talk Any ideas? Maya: I don't know... I really wonder about that Pierce... Phoenix: Yeah, I know what you mean. He seems to have a lot of power over everybody and everything, doesn't he? Maya: Actually, what I was really wondering about is that shoulder mech of his... I mean, it's pretty amazing how many things that tiny little contraption can do. Ooh! What if that  mech is actually Pierce's true control center, like his brain? Phoenix: Um... Maya...? Maya: And what if, somewhere in Sprocket Manor, he has another shiny, golden body! And then, during emergencies, he can switch bodies and become Super Pierce Nichody! Phoenix: This is what I get for trying to have a serious conversation with a super geek... What to do Phoenix: I bet all Ellen wants is to start her happy new life with Sorin. Maya: Yeah... I bet you're right... Phoenix: But do you think the truth will really set her free...? Maya: All you can do is do your job to the best of your ability! And if we can bring Ellen joy that way, all the better, right?! Phoenix: Maya... Maya: Either way, I think true happiness can only be found in the truth. ... Um, what are you looking at me like that for? Phoenix: I was just thinking about how wise that sounded. Looks like our little Maya is growing up! Maya: Would you knock it off? I'm trying to be serious here! Phoenix: S-Sorry! Sorry! Present Broken Lantern (after examining repaired Pegabull lantern) Maya: Ema did a pretty good job fixing this guy up. Is it just me, or does this Pegabull look happy to be whole again? Still... Phoenix: Still...? Maya: If Ema had let me do it, I could've made it ten times cooler! I would've made the wings bigger, given it three horns, and painted it all red. But that's not all! Phoenix: It would've ceased to be a Pegabull waaay before that point, Maya... After examining \"EXIT\" door, smaller table, and repaired Pegabull lantern, then examining intact Pegabull lantern: Phoenix: Whew! Well, I think we've checked out everything relevant to this case. ???: What are you two doing here? Phoenix: Wait, what are YOU doing here?! Sorin! Shouldn't you be resting in bed? You're injured! Sorin: How do you know about that?! ...Um, never mind. My notebook... Have you seen my notebook? I can't find it anywhere. My notebook... I need my notebook... Phoenix: (What's the matter with him?) Sorin: M-My notebook... I need... I have to have... I-I... ???: Master Sorin! Nichody: Master Sorin! I told you to stay in bed! Sorin: M-My notebook...! Nichody: Here you go. Sorin: Yes... This is it...! Phoenix: (So Sorin gets emotionally unstable without that notebook of his...?) Sorin: ...Phew. Phoenix: (Looks like he's calmed down now.) Sorin, do you mind if I talk to you for a minute? Nichody: I cannot allow you to do that. What if his wound were to open up again? He needs to rest. Phoenix: Arngh... I guess you're right... Nichody: Now, if you will excuse us. Master Sorin, let us retire. Sorin: ...All right. Maya: There they go. Phoenix: Pierce is right. I guess he really isn't in any condition to be questioned. Well, let's go back to the agency and sort through what we've learned. Mooring Dock Talk The incident Phoenix: Hey, Larry... I thought you had a book signing? Larry: Yeah, but I snuck off early. I was worried about how your investigation was going! Phoenix: Nobody came to get their book signed, huh? Larry: What kind of a thing is that to say?! Phoenix: Well, how many people showed up, then? Larry: Well, um... Fine! It was four people, if you gotta know! Including the employees... Phoenix: S-Sorry... I shouldn't have asked... Larry: Quit looking at me like I'm some pitiful piglet! Phoenix: Um, why don't you get back to your signing? Another two or three people could show up before the store closes... Larry: They already put away the book signing table and cleaned everything up! I... I don't have anywhere else to go. Phoenix: Gee, Larry... I'm sorry I gave you such a hard time. Larry: I told you to quit looking at me like that! Ellen Phoenix: So, have you been to see Ellen? Larry: Nah. Edgey told me to stay away. He said things always get complicated whenever I'm around. Can you believe the guy? Phoenix: (Actually, I'd tell Larry the exact same thing if I were Edgeworth.) Larry: So... How's the investigation coming along? Phoenix: We've made some progress, but I don't feel like we've gotten to the heart of things yet. Larry: Come on, Nick! You gotta do better than that! Me and Elly's whole future is riding on you! Phoenix: I-I don't think I can take on the heavy responsibility of your future, Larry. Larry: Whaaat? First, Edgey, and now YOU, Nick? Why does everybody gotta be so mean to me? Phoenix: C'mon, Larry! I really don't have time to be standing around shooting the breeze! Why don't you just get back to your book signing, huh? Larry: W-Will you come with me, ol' buddy...? Phoenix: Not a chance! Larry: Ooooooooh...! Phoenix: (Enough is enough already, Larry...) September 22Wright Anything Agency Phoenix: We're back. Anybody here? Athena: Oh, hi, Boss! Phoenix: Athena? I thought you were with Trucy? Athena: Um... I guess you could say that I'm... I-I'm taking a short break! B-But enough about me! What about the investigation! Did you find out anything? Phoenix: Well, turns out that the third person Ellen says she saw at the crime scene... ...might have been Sorin Sprocket. Athena: What? Really? I always thought he seemed suspicious... Phoenix: Thing is, by the time Sorin got to the vista deck... ...the murder had already occurred, apparently. Athena: No way! I don't buy that! Not for a second! It's a cover-up! A cover-up, I tell you! Phoenix: That's... certainly a possibility. And, as a lawyer, it's certainly a possibility I have to pursue, but... Athena: But what? It's your job, right? So pursue the heck out of it! Just do it! Phoenix: Yeah, but... ...is that really what's best for Ellen? Maya: Sorin could be found guilty if the truth comes out tomorrow... But if we don't pursue this possibility, Ellen could be found guilty instead... Athena: Oh, man... Either way, it sure doesn't spell out \"happily ever after\" for the two of them... So what are you gonna do, Mr. Wright?! Phoenix: I can't let an innocent person get convicted. So I guess all I can really do... is pursue the truth. Even if it ends up devastating Ellen... Athena: What a tough call to make... Maya: S-Still, there's always a chance, right? Maybe something will come up during the trial that will save their marriage! Phoenix: I hope so. I really do... ......Well, Maya, let's go. Maya: Break the news to Ellen, you mean...? Phoenix: Yup. Athena: Mr. Wright! Please take me with you! I bet I could help you counsel Ellen through this piece of bad news! Phoenix: Athena... I appreciate the offer, but don't you have somewhere else to be? Athena: ...Do I? Trucy: Athena! What are you doing here?! I've been looking all over for you! Come on, now! Let's get back to practicing! Athena: N-No... Wait...! My body can't take it anymore! B-Boss, you gotta help me! Phoenix: A lawyer always keeps their promises, Athena. Athena: B-But, Boooooss...! Trucy: If you bail on me one more time, Athena, I'm going to use a real blade on you! Athena: Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek! Phoenix: (Sorry, Athena, but somebody's gotta do it... Better you than me, though... Hang in there, kiddo!) Come on, Maya. We'd better get going. September 22Detention Center - Visitor's Room Phoenix: Hello, Ellen. Ellen: How did your investigation go, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Before I answer that, I need to ask you something. Was Sorin with you when Mr. Gloomsbury attacked you in the reception hall? Ellen: I, uh...... I'm sorry I kept it from you. I was afraid that he'd come under suspicion if I told you. So I kept quiet about it. I'm really sorry... Phoenix: ...I see. I thought it was probably something like that. Listen, Ellen... I'm afraid I had to make a very difficult decision based on what I found out... Ellen: ...What kind of decision? Phoenix: This is... very hard for me to say, but... The mysterious person you saw at the scene of the crime... was most likely Sorin. Ellen: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Phoenix: In other words, in court tomorrow... ...I'm afraid I'll have to propose the possibility that Sorin is the true culprit. Ellen: No... Sorin is innocent... Nooo... Phoenix: But don't you see? If I don't try to pursue that line of thought, you'll be found guilty! Ellen: No... Nooooo... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Phoenix: Please, Ellen! Calm down! Ellen: WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Sorin just can't be found guilty! I'd much rather I be found guilty instead! Maya: Ellen! You can't let yourself think like that! Ellen: But..! But...! But...! Nooooooooooooooooooo! Maya: Marriage is for life, right? Do you really think you can run away from the truth and still be truly happy with him? Ellen: WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! You're not married, so how can you possibly understand?! Sometimes you've just got to do whatever it takes to make things wooooork! Maya: But...! N-Nick, you talk to her... Phoenix: H-Hey! Don't just dump this all on me! Ellen: Mr. Wright! I'm innocent, and Sorin is, too! So, please...! Prove our innocence in coooourt! Phoenix: I... I'll certainly do everything in my power... (I just hope she doesn't lose control like this in court tomorrow...) To be continued Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: Nothing particularly interesting here. Area already examined Phoenix: (We've already searched here, but it never hurts to take another look around.) Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I think I'd better take a step back and gather my thoughts a little more...)\n--The Truth--Sorin: The truth is, I went to the vista deck with Pierce.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You didn't mention this because you didn't want Mr. Nichody to fall under suspicion? Is that because he has something to hide? Sorin: I just didn't want the police to take up his time with all their questions, that's all. Neither the company nor the household would function smoothly without him. Phoenix: I see. (Wow. It sounds like Pierce is absolutely indispensible [sic] to the Sprockets.) Anyway, getting back to your statement... When did you meet up with Mr. Nichody? Sorin: We met up on my way to the vista deck. I think Pierce and some of my relatives were on another floor... But Pierce heard the commotion, and came running to my aide. Phoenix: (He could hear the pandemonium all the way from another floor...?) Judge: Mr. Wright, would you like the current statement added to the witness's testimony? Have it added Phoenix: Yes, please, Your Honor. Judge: Very well. Adds statement \"Pierce heard the commotion, and he came running.\" Leave it out Phoenix: No, thank you, Your Honor. Judge: I see. Very well. Leads back to cross-examinationPress (after adding statement \"Pierce heard the commotion, and he came running.\") Phoenix: Phoenix: You didn't mention this because you didn't want Mr. Nichody to fall under suspicion? Is that because he has something to hide? Sorin: I just didn't want the police to take up his time with all their questions, that's all. Neither the company nor the household would function smoothly without him. Phoenix: I see. (Wow. It sounds like Pierce is absolutely indispensible [sic] to the Sprockets.) Anyway, getting back to your statement... When did you meet up with Mr. Nichody? Sorin: We met up on my way to the vista deck. I think Pierce and some of my relatives were on another floor... But Pierce heard the commotion, and came running to my aide. Phoenix: (He could hear the pandemonium all the way from another floor...?)Sorin: Pierce heard the commotion, and he came running.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Did Mr. Nichody come alone?  Sorin: ...I believe some of his subordinates were with him, but... ...I don't remember exactly how many. Phoenix: (He may say there were others, but seeing how they pulled that \"second reception\" off... ...I can't completely trust anything he has to say, either...) I see. So you, Mr. Nichody, and a few others headed to the vista deck, is that right? Sorin: ......That's right.Sorin: That's why my name doesn't appear on the hold entry record.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Your name doesn't appear on the hold entry record... ...because you entered with Mr. Nichody using his key card? Sorin: ......That's right. Phoenix: (So I guess the hold entry record doesn't matter as much as we thought. But now that Sorin's saying he was with Pierce and a few others... ...it's pretty tough to refute that statement.) Edgeworth: What's the matter, Mr. Wright? Cat got your tongue? Did you finally realize there's no point in continuing this trial any longer? Phoenix: O-Of course not! (Grr... I'll wipe that smug look off your face!) Mr. Sprocket, please continue with your testimony!Sorin: I was badly injured from being stabbed, but I was frantic.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Speaking of your injury, how are you doing now? Sorin: The knife wound is deep, and continues to throb with pain. Fortunately, my internal organs were spared... ...but one wrong move would've spelled the end for me there. Phoenix: Even so, I've seen you up and about all over the place since the incident. Sorin: I'm only following my doctor's orders to perform some daily light exercises. Judge: Mr. Wright. Would you like Mr. Sprocket's statement about his condition added to his testimony? ...Not that it appears especially relevant to me... Phoenix: Should I have him add it to his testimony...? Have it added Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. I'd like to have it added to his testimony. Judge: ...I see. Very well. Adds statement \"The knife wound is quite deep, and continues to throb with pain.\" Leave it out Phoenix: That's all right, Your Honor. I think we should leave it out. Judge: Very well. I understand. Leads back to cross-examinationPress (after adding statement \"The knife wound is quite deep, and continues to throb with pain.\") Phoenix: Phoenix: Speaking of your injury, how are you doing now? Sorin: The knife wound is deep, and continues to throb with pain. Fortunately, my internal organs were spared... ...but one wrong move would've spelled the end for me there. Phoenix: Even so, I've seen you up and about all over the place since the incident. Sorin: I'm only following my doctor's orders to perform some daily light exercises.Sorin: The knife wound is quite deep, and continues to throb with pain.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Your injury was really that deep? Sorin: ...Luckily, it missed my internal organs. Otherwise, I wouldn't be alive right now. Edgeworth: According to his doctor, his injury will take about three weeks to heal. There's no way someone with that kind of injury could have gone along the outside wall. Phoenix: Ngh... B-But he might've been able to with the burst of adrenaline brought on by the pain! Edgeworth: Hmph. Adrenaline, adrenaline. Is that your answer for everything? In a court of law, the only thing that matters is evidence -- not rampant speculation! Phoenix: At least admit it's scientific rampant speculation... Sorin: ......May I continue? Phoenix: ...Yes, of course.Present Candelabra Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Sprocket, you just said your injury is a knife wound, didn't you?\"Sorin: By the time we reached the scene, it was all over.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you still insist that you reached the vista deck after the murder had occurred... Is that correct? Sorin: Yes, that's right. Ellen must've killed him. There's no other explanation... Maya: I guess whether Pierce was with Sorin or not doesn't change the outcome... Phoenix: I guess not... In fact, more witnesses actually makes it worse for us...Phoenix: So another cover-up, huh?Maya: That Sorin has too many secrets! I bet he's still hiding other things, too!Phoenix: That's definitely a possibility. But in a situation like this, what we have to do is go back to the basics.Maya: You mean go over the testimony and check for any lies or inconsistencies?Phoenix: You got it.Maya: All right, Nick. Let's go for it!Phoenix: Mr. Sprocket, you just said your injury is a knife wound, didn't you?Sorin: ............Phoenix: But the weapon you were stabbed with was this candelabra! A fact I know you're quite aware of.Nichody: ...Very well. This is what I heard directly from Master Sorin himself. As you surmised, Master Sorin was stabbed by Gloomsbury on the day of the murder. It happened after the first wedding reception. The happy couple was in the reception hall when, suddenly, Gloomsbury appeared... He attacked Miss Ellen and tried to take her away. Master Sorin went to stop him, and found himself in a struggle with Gloomsbury. That is when Master Sorin was stabbed with the candelabra, he said.Sorin: Unnngh!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: It must've been a simple memory slip that made him misspeak. It happens to everyone. It has nothing to do with the case. You must be pretty desperate to point out something so minute.Phoenix: Grr!Judge: I have to agree, Mr. Wright. You hardly need to make such a big deal over such a small mistake.Phoenix: But I contend that it's an important inconsistency! (Besides, I couldn't find anything else. This is the only thing I have to go after!)Edgeworth: And I say it's NOT important. Now, let's not waste any more time on this matter.Judge: I agree. Everybody has a little memory lapse every now and then.Phoenix:Phoenix: B-But, Your Honor! Please let me explain!Judge: But can you? Can you really explain to this court what makes this slip so important?Phoenix: Yes, I can, Your Honor! (After all, it was Sorin himself who told Pierce that he had been stabbed by a candelabra. This is more than a simple \"memory slip.\" There has to be some kind of reason for it.)Judge: ...Well, Mr. Wright? Please explain why the witness's slip of the tongue is so important.Phoenix: The point to focus on here is WHY the witness would mistake the weapon used to stab him. (Think carefully, Phoenix. This could very well change the course of the trial.)Judge: I see. So why did the witness make that mistake, Mr. Wright?Phoenix: Mr. Sprocket identified the wrong weapon used against him because...He misspoke Phoenix: ...he simply misspoke! Edgeworth: ...Exactly. That's what I've been saying all along. It doesn't matter in the least that he named the wrong weapon. Phoenix: ...Ack! Wait! I-I didn't mean to say he misspoke! Judge: It looks like you're the one who misspoke, Mr. Wright. And make no mistake, this penalty is quite intentional. Phoenix: (What happened to letting small slips-of-the-tongue slide...?) Leads back to: \"Mr. Sprocket identified the wrong weapon used against him because...\"He's covering for someone Phoenix: ...Mr. Sprocket is trying to cover for someone! Judge: He is? Hmm... And who might that be? Phoenix: Uh, well... Mr. Gloomsbury, maybe...? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Why would Mr. Sprocket try to cover for the man who stabbed him?! And regardless the weapon, the fact remains that Mr. Gloomsbury stabbed the witness! Judge: Exactly, Mr. Edgeworth. Maya: Yeah... Sorry, Nick, but I have to agree... Phoenix: Ugh... I guess that makes sense... Judge: Too bad there's no one to cover for you, Mr. Wright. You'll have to accept this penalty all by your lonesome. Phoenix: (I wouldn't mind having someone to cover for me every once in a while... Oh, well. I can't lose heart now! I've gotta just keep on trying!) Leads back to: \"Mr. Sprocket identified the wrong weapon used against him because...\"He has no memory of it Leads to: \"...he doesn't remember the incident, let alone the weapon used against him!\"Phoenix: ...he doesn't remember the incident, let alone the weapon used against him! Not only that... ...but I believe Mr. Sprocket has some sort of memory disorder! Therefore, the defense contends that Mr. Sprocket's testimony thus far is invalid!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: Just because you can't find a flaw in his testimony, you want to throw it all out?! Your baseless claim is nothing but pure slander of the witness's character!Judge: Hmm... Mr. Edgeworth is correct, Mr. Wright. Can you explain your grounds for making this claim?Phoenix: ...Of course, Your Honor. (Think of what Sorin has said, how he's behaved. That's where I'll find a clue...)Judge: Very well. Let's hear your argument, then.Phoenix: My grounds for claiming that Mr. Sprocket has a memory disorder is...His taciturn personality Phoenix: ... his taciturn personality! He may seem standoffish, but in reality... ...he's desperately trying to memorize everything that's happening! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: So anyone who is quiet and standoffish can be accused of having a memory disorder? Do the guard at the detention center, or the bailiff here have memory disorders, too?! Phoenix: N-No... Judge: Those grounds are nowhere near sufficient to make such a claim, Mr. Wright. Perhaps you should take a cue from the witness, and speak less frequently instead. Phoenix: (I have to come up with a more convincing argument...!) Leads back to: \"My grounds for claiming that Mr. Sprocket has a memory disorder is...\"His notebook Leads to: \"...the notebook he always has with him.\"His airplane pen Phoenix: ...that airplane pen he always uses. The truth is it's an external memory device! Judge: I-It's a what?! What makes you say that?! Phoenix: I-I mean, it transforms into an airplane and stuff... ...so I thought it wouldn't be a stretch for an inventor like him to make a memory bank. Judge: Hmm... That theory is simply amazing... Amazingly sloppy! I suggest you invent yourself some better ideas, defense! Phoenix: ...I guess the idea of an external memory device is pretty half-baked. (I'd better think it over again... And this time, I'll put a little more thought into it!) Leads back to: \"My grounds for claiming that Mr. Sprocket has a memory disorder is...\"Phoenix: ...the notebook he always has with him. I saw daily events and information about the people around him recorded in it.Judge: Like a diary, perhaps?Phoenix: No, Your Honor. It's much too detailed to be an ordinary diary. It's more on the order of a database, actually.Judge: A database, you say?Phoenix: That's right. For some reason, Mr. Sprocket is apparently unable to retain memories. That's why he writes every little detail of his life down in his notebook!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: How could you possibly know that for sure?! He might just be an extremely compulsive person!Phoenix: I thought so, too, myself... at first. To be honest, we accidentally got a stain on that notebook yesterday...Maya: You mean, YOU got a stain on it!Phoenix: Hey! YOU'RE the one who tried to grab it out of my--!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: Never mind whose fault it was! Just get to the point already!Phoenix: R-Right... Sorry... Mr. Sprocket.Sorin: ............Phoenix: The page Ms. Fey got a stain on yesterday... That's the page with the details of your stabbing on it, isn't it?Sorin: N-No! I only write in this notebook because I'm very compulsive! Now, drop the subject already!Phoenix: Sorry, but I'm not convinced. I noticed an odd fact about your notebook, Mr. Sprocket.Sorin: ............Phoenix: On the earlier pages, you used it to write down invention ideas. But after a certain date, you started writing down a lot more, and in much more detail.Sorin: ............Phoenix: I believe your memory disorder... ...stems from what happened on that date!Judge: Something so monumental, it caused a memory disorder, Mr. Wright...?Sorin: ...You don't know what you're talking about!Phoenix: Sorry, but I DO know what I'm talking about... And this is the proof. This is the thing that caused Mr. Sprocket's memory disorder.Present Newspaper Article Phoenix: Leads to: \"You were involved in this car accident, too, weren't you, Mr. Sprocket?\"Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This is the cause of Mr. Sprocket's memory disorder! Judge: ...That? And how would something like that affect a person's memory? Phoenix: Well... what if one were to knock their head against it a few times...? Judge: I see. And would you care to demonstrate that theory for us personally? Phoenix: N-No, thanks, Your Honor. I think I'll pass. Judge: Well then, I hope this knocks some sense into you instead. Phoenix: (I'd better take another good look at the evidence...) Leads back to: \"This is the thing that caused Mr. Sprocket's memory disorder.\"Phoenix: You were involved in this car accident, too, weren't you, Mr. Sprocket? And the shock of losing your beloved older sister... ...is what caused you to develop your memory disorder.Edgeworth: ...Is this true, Mr. Sprocket?Sorin: ............Judge: Well? Is it?Sorin: ............N-Nnrgh...Phoenix: Mr. Sprocket!Sorin: Uuughhh...... I-It's true. That accident did something to my mind...Edgeworth: Wh-What...?Sorin: Ever since that day, every time I go to sleep, I lose my memories... And when I wake up, the most recent thing I can remember is the day I lost my sister. It's as if I'm constantly going back in time.Judge: What...?! Th-That's... truly tragic...Edgeworth: An inconsolable time traveler who goes back in time whenever he goes to sleep...Sorin: Besides... time travelers do exist, you know. But you wouldn't understand.Phoenix: (So that's what Sorin meant... He was talking about himself...)Sorin: The reactions of the people around me each time I awoke made me aware of my condition. That's why I decided to write everything down in my notebook... So I could move forward.Phoenix: So the only memories you have since that day are the ones written in that notebook?Sorin: ...That's right.Phoenix: And since the page about your stabbing got stained, you couldn't read from it, could you?Sorin: ............Phoenix: There's just one more thing I'd like you to clarify for me, Mr. Sprocket. Exactly what are your feelings toward the victim?Judge: Mr. Sprocket's feelings toward Dumas Gloomsbury?Phoenix: That's right, Your Honor. The witness said that every time he wakes up from sleep... ...his mind goes back to the day his sister died.Edgeworth: ...M-Mr. Wright! Y-You can't mean...!Phoenix: Mr. Sprocket!Sorin: ............Phoenix: Your pent-up feelings of anger and resentment towards Mr. Gloomsbury for the accident... ...were renewed each and every time you woke, were they not?Sorin: ............Ngh.Phoenix: But you couldn't take it anymore, so you turned to murder! Isn't that right?!Judge: Wh-What?! Mr. Wright, are you saying that the witness murdered Mr. Gloomsbury... ...for revenge?!Edgeworth: ...Urgh!Phoenix: Well, Mr. Sprocket?Sorin: ...........I-I...???:Phoenix: M-Ms. Wyatt!Ellen: ............ Y-Your Honor... I did it... I killed Mr. Gloomsbury!Phoenix: NO--!Judge: WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!Phoenix: M-Ms. Wyatt! What are you trying to do?!Ellen: D-Don't tell me you're still thinking of going that route?! Sorin is innocent! He can't be found guilty! Take me instead!Phoenix: E-Ellen, please! Try and get a hold of yourself!Phoenix: (I guess she really meant it...)Ellen: My Sorin didn't do anything wrong! I'm the one who should be convicted!Judge: Are we to understand that you're confessing your guilt?Phoenix: (No, no, NO!) Now, wait just a minute here--Sorin:Sorin: E-Ellen... Why would you cover for me...? After I testified that I thought you must've killed him...?Ellen: I'll admit... I couldn't believe my ears at first... But... all I want is for you to be happy. Your happiness... is my happiness, Sorin.Sorin: But without my notebook... ...I'd even forget those feelings of yours by tomorrow. Knowing that, do you still feel this way?Judge: ............Ellen: You've loved me all this time... ...the same way you did before the accident. That's how I know... ...that you're the same person I've always loved. No disorder can change that!Sorin: ......Ellen... ......Your Honor, there are two things I'd like to correct.Judge: Two corrections? What are they?Sorin: First of all, I want to withdraw one of my statements.Sorin: ...That's right... Dumas was killed... by Ellen.Sorin: Without memories to rely on... ...I took the police completely at their word.Edgeworth: You can't be serious...!Maya: So that means... ...Sorin never really doubted Ellen in the first place, did he, Nick!Phoenix: (Ellen really does love Sorin with all her heart... But, in order to save her... ...I'll still have to go after Sorin. I hope you can forgive me, Ellen!)Judge: And what is your other correction, Mr. Sprocket?Sorin: ............ The truth is, I never felt anger or resentment towards Dumas about my sister.Phoenix: What? Why not?!Sorin: That's because...... the one who caused the car accident... ...was me.Phoenix: WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!Judge: Order! Order in the court! Please continue, Mr. Sprocket.Sorin: I'm the one who killed my sister... To protect my career and my future, my father made Dumas take the blame... ...in exchange for money and the position of lead servant.Newspaper Article updated in the Court Record.Sorin: So you see, Dumas must've held a grudge against me, not the other way around. And he must've attacked Ellen... to get his revenge on me...!Phoenix: Are you sure about all of this, Mr. Sprocket?Sorin: Very sure. It's all been written down in detail in my notebook.Judge: That notebook is important evidence supplying background to this case. I must insist you submit it as evidence.Sorin's Notebook added to the Court Record.Sorin: The lawyer said I had \"turned to murder,\" but that's just not true. However, it is true that... ...my older sister and Dumas are both dead because of me and my negligence.Judge: I just glanced through Mr. Sprocket's notebook. I wasn't able to read the part about when he was stabbed due to the bloodstain... ...but what's written here about his sister's car accident is exactly as he stated.Edgeworth: Your Honor. As long as it matches what's written in that notebook... ...can we still take the witness's testimony as valid, in spite of his memory disorder?Judge: ...Yes, I believe we can.Edgeworth: I understand now that the witness's memory is in disarray. But if what Mr. Sprocket himself wrote in this notebook is true...Sorin: ............Edgeworth: Then that means, by the time Mr. Sprocket's party reached the scene... ...the victim had already been killed.Phoenix: (Edgeworth's right. I'm still in the same bind as before... But should I really simply accept the contents of the notebook... ...as a substitute for Sorin's memory?)Judge: Well, Mr. Wright? What do you think? Will you accept Mr. Sprocket's notebook as an official representation of his memories?Phoenix: Will I accept Mr. Sprocket's notebook as an official representation of his memories...?Yes Phoenix: Your Honor, I can accept Mr. Sprocket's notebook as... Maya: Nick! Are you sure about that?! Phoenix: Um, not really. I mean, I already don't like where this is going... Your Honor! The defense requests a timeout! Judge: There are no \"timeouts\" in a court of law! Give me your answer, and no dawdling! Phoenix: (This is an important point. I need to be careful in how I answer!) Leads back to: \"Will I accept Mr. Sprocket's notebook as an official representation of his memories...?\"No Leads to: \"Wait a minute, Your Honor!\"Phoenix: Wait a minute, Your Honor! The defense requests a chance to examine the notebook to see if it's trustworthy!Judge: Hmm... Very well. But be quick about it.Phoenix: Thank you, Your Honor.Maya: So, how should we examine it?Phoenix: Well, we should look at it from all different angles to see if there's anything suspicious.Examine front cover or back cover Phoenix: There's no point if I don't look at what's inside. I have to open it. With your permission, Sorin... here I go! Yikes! Oh, it's just the page Maya got all stained. But I guess it's not going to be very helpful at this moment. I'll keep going. This is the last page where there's writing. Hmm... Something about this page doesn't sit right with me... I'd better take a closer look.Examine front cover or back cover (subsequent times) Phoenix: Nothing special about the cover...Examine left page (after examining front cover or back cover) Phoenix: There are some mathematical formulas written here. It looks like he was calculating something to do with distance and time...? But I wouldn't know if this had anything to do with the case...Examine right page (after examining front cover or back cover) Phoenix: This page is blank.Examine torn page fragment (after examining front cover or back cover) Leads to: \"Huh?\"Phoenix: Huh? A page has been torn out. And it looks like there was something written on it! It looks like a page has been torn out here. Mr. Sprocket, do you know what was written on it?Sorin: Oh, that? I often tear out a page when I write somebody a note. I probably wrote something down for somebody, tore it out and gave it to them.Phoenix: Oh, yeah...!Edgeworth: That solves that, then.Phoenix:Phoenix: Wait a minute! We can't ignore the possibility that something important was written on that page!Judge: But now that the page has been torn out... ...how can we determine what was written there?Phoenix: W-Well... Let's see. To find out what was written in the notebook, we should...Hold it up to the light Phoenix: I know! We should hold the notebook up to the light! Hrngh... I don't see a thing. Judge: What are you flailing about over there for, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: N-No, just a minute, Your Honor... I just need a little more time to... JUdge: Mr. Wright, this court does not accept answers in the form of pantomime. Phoenix: (Ugh. I think the judge misinterpreted my movements...) Leads back to: \"Let's see. To find out what was written in the notebook, we should...\"Heat it with a lighter Phoenix: I know! We should heat the notebook with a lighter! Maybe the heat will reveal what was written! Your Honor, do you have a lighter I could borrow? Judge: A lighter? And what exactly are you planning to do with one? Phoenix: I want to heat this notebook up over an open flame. Judge: Do you have any reason to believe there's something to be gained by doing that? Phoenix: Well... it's just a hunch, Your Honor, but... Judge: I won't let you take a lighter to evidence over some simple hunch! Have some sense, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: (The judge is right. Setting the notebook on fire would be a disaster. I'd better look at this more logically, like he said...) Leads back to: \"Let's see. To find out what was written in the notebook, we should...\"Use fingerprint powder Leads to: \"If we use fingerprint powder on the notebook, we might be able to see what was written!\"Phoenix: If we use fingerprint powder on the notebook, we might be able to see what was written!Judge: Fingerprint powder? How would that help us find out what was written there?Phoenix: Well, if the writing left indentations on the blank page behind it... ...fingerprint powder could make those small indentations visible to the naked eye.Edgeworth: Oh, stop. Fingerprint powder would only sully the notebook further.Judge: Mr. Wright, if you use the powder and still don't find anything... ...then you must accept the notebook as a representation of the witness's memories.Phoenix: All right, Your Honor. I understand. (If I don't find anything, it's all over anyway... Powder, don't fail me now!) I will now use fingerprint powder on the blank page... ...to find out if we can see what was written on the torn-out page. (First, I'll apply some fingerprint powder to these pages with [A / Space]. (Changed from [First, I touch a spot to dust it with fingerprint powder.] in the original release) When I've dusted on enough powder, I'll use \"Blow\" ([X / Y / R])... (Changed from [When I've dusted on enough powder, I blow into the mic...] in the original release) ...to blow the excess powder away. If something should appear... ...I should switch to \"Analyze\" mode ([L / LB / Q])... (Changed from [...I should touch 'Analyze' (L)...] in the original release) ...point to what came up, then \"Confirm\" ([A / Space]) my choice. (Changed from [...point to what came up, then touch 'Confirm' (A).] in the original release))Examine \"I struck and killed Dumas\" Leads to: \"It says, \"I struck and killed Dumas\"...\"Examine incomplete sentence or \"Dumas took Ellen to the vista deck\" Phoenix: It looks like I didn't get quite enough fingerprint powder on the page. I guess I'd better dust on a little more.Examine anywhere else Phoenix: Hmm... I'm not seeing anything... I'd better make sure I've got the right spot...Phoenix: It says, \"I struck and killed Dumas\"... (Th-This is huge...!) \"I struck and killed Dumas...\" That's what was written on the torn-out page!Judge: WH-WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!Edgeworth: I-It can't be...!Ellen:Ellen: I-I don't believe it! There has to be some kind of mistake! Sorin would never... COULD never...!Phoenix: M-Ms. Wyatt!Judge: Bailiff, please get the defendant to the infirmary at once!Judge: Apparently, the defendant got too worked up. She's resting in the infirmary as we speak. Now then, please continue, Mr. Wright.Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor... This notebook is all Mr. Sprocket has to remember things by. With this critical page torn out... ...not even Mr. Sprocket himself knew the truth of what he'd done.Sorin: ...I'm the one... who killed Dumas...? So it wasn't Ellen... Oh, thank goodness...Phoenix: Mr. Sprocket, does this mean you were at the crime scene during the murder after all?Sorin: ...I guess I must have been.Sorin's Notebook updated in the Court Record.Phoenix: But, Mr. Sprocket... ...can we really believe what's written in this notebook?Sorin: Nobody touches this notebook but me. And when I sleep, it's under lock and key. I don't remember writing that I killed Dumas, but I guess I must have...Judge: W-Well! Now that we have a confession... ...I'm afraid I must render my verdict.Edgeworth: Of all the...!Sorin: Yes, Your Honor. Please give your ruling now, while Ellen is asleep. I want the woman I love to be set free as soon as possible.Maya: Sorin really does love Ellen after all, doesn't he...Phoenix: Yeah... (So this is how it ends... But is that how it really went down? Is there really no way for them both to be happy...?)Judge: Hmm... I know we should consider anything written in the notebook to be the truth, but still...Sorin: I myself wrote of the crime in my notebook. No further proof is necessary.Phoenix: (Sorin himself wrote it in his notebook...? Wait a minute...)Judge: Hmm... Very well... I will now give my verdict.Phoenix: (Ellen is about to be found not guilty, and Sorin will be convicted for the crime instead. And yet... Am I really ready for the judge to give his ruling?)Yes Phoenix: (If the judge declares his verdict now, Ellen will be found not guilty. As her defense lawyer, that's my job: to prove her innocence. Still... will this verdict really make Ellen happy?) Leads to: \"No... Not when there's still one more avenue left to explore...!\"No Leads to: \"No... Not when there's still one more avenue left to explore...!\"Phoenix: (No... Not when there's still one more avenue left to explore...!)Judge: This court finds the defendant, Ellen Wyatt...Phoenix:Phoenix: Your Honor, there's still something that bothers me about that notebook!Judge: Oh, is there?Edgeworth: What are you doing, Mr. Wright?! All you have to do is keep quiet, and your client's a free woman!Phoenix: I know... but I think there might be more to this case than meets the eye. (I'm not quite sure yet... but I think there still might be a way... ...a way for Ellen and Sorin to be happy!)Judge: What do you mean by, \"more than meets the eye,\" Mr. Wright?Phoenix: I believe the question here, Your Honor, should be... ...why was the incriminating page torn out in the first place?Judge: Why, to destroy the evidence, I would imagine.Phoenix: But removing it from the notebook is the same as removing it from Mr. Sprocket's memory. Which means he wouldn't have been able to trick the police if he came under suspicion. No. If he wanted to cover up his crime, he would have to remember that he had done it.Edgeworth: Just what are you getting at with this line of inquiry, Mr. Wright?!Judge: Yes, please explain it so that we can all understand.Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. The page was torn out of the notebook because...He wanted to forget what happened Phoenix: ...Mr. Sprocket wanted to forget all about this incident! Judge: Are you claiming that Mr. Sprocket tore out the page himself? Phoenix: That's right, Your Honor. Judge: But you just said a moment ago that Mr. Sprocket wouldn't do that! To your inconsistent claims, I say, \"Objection!\" Phoenix: (I didn't expect one of those from the judge... I can't have a contradiction between my own claims! I'd better be more careful...) Leads back to: \"The page was torn out of the notebook because...\"It was torn out by accident Phoenix: The page must've been torn out by accident. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Mr. Wright. Earlier, both you and Mr. Sprocket were talking about how important the notebook is. Therefore, do you really think Mr. Sprocket would allow it to fall so easily to such abuse? Phoenix: N-No. I'm sure it was very well taken care of... Edgeworth: Then it's not very likely a page would get torn by chance, now is it?! Phoenix: N-No, not very likely at all... Judge: This is what happens when you try to abuse the system, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Argh...! I'd better be more careful with my answers...) Leads back to: \"The page was torn out of the notebook because...\"Somebody else tore it out Leads to: \"The incriminating page...\"Phoenix: The incriminating page... ...was torn out by somebody else!Judge: Wh-What?! Order! Order! Are you claiming a third person interfered with the notebook?Phoenix: It's not all that surprising if you consider what's happened up until now. After both the car accident, and the murder of Dumas Gloomsbury... ...there was always a cover-up not far behind!Sorin:Sorin: B-But... I had my notebook with me at all times!Phoenix: Did you? Because I remember you were in a panic yesterday because you couldn't find it!Sorin: Th-That's true...!Judge: So who orchestrated this particular cover-up, Mr. Wright?Phoenix: If we think back over the course of the trial, it's pretty easy to guess.

Claim returned to sender! Phoenix: Rejection received, Your Honor... (Okay, slow down... Time to collect my thoughts!) Leads back to: \"The one who may have tried to tamper with Sorin's memories is...\"Phoenix: The one who tampered with the notebook in order to manipulate Mr. Sprocket's memory... ...is Pierce Nichody!Sorin: Pierce...? Pierce tried to tamper with my memories...? Pierce was... manipulating me?Phoenix: Case in point: the two receptions that were held to cover up the murder. It was Mr. Nichody who directed the guests and orchestrated the entire scheme.Sorin: N-No... It can't be... Which of my memories are mine, and which have been rewritten...? When did he start rewriting my memories...?! Who wrote this?! And this?! And this?! And this?! And this?! And this?! And this?!

Ellen...Phoenix: Mr. Sprocket!Judge: Bailiff! Please get Mr. Sprocket to the infirmary! On the double!Judge: Mr. Sprocket has been taken to the infirmary. We don't have to worry about him running away, so let us resume where we left off.Phoenix: Your Honor. The defense would like to call Pierce Nichody to the stand.Edgeworth:Edgeworth: We already know he carried out the cover-up to protect the company and Mr. Sprocket. What more do you want from him?Phoenix: This time it's different. The notebook... or, rather, Mr. Sprocket's memories, have been tampered with. That means the only person who knows the whole truth... is now Mr. Nichody.Edgeworth: Don't tell me... Are you actually trying to drum up a third suspect... ...in order to exonerate the defendant and her groom?!Phoenix: I'm not drumming up anything, nor do I have grounds to accuse him of anything... yet. All I know is that Mr. Nichody is the only one who knows the truth! (And I think he's still hiding something! Something we don't know about yet!)Edgeworth: Hmph. No grounds \"yet,\" is it?Judge: Well, Mr. Edgeworth? Does the prosecution consent to calling the witness to the stand?Edgeworth: It does, Your Honor. ...However, I would like a little time to talk with the witness before we do.Judge: Very well. We will break for a twenty-minute recess.To be continuedSeptember 23District Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3Phoenix: (Now we'll have to face Pierce on the stand... I'm not sure if I should be surprised or not. One thing's for sure... He won't be an easy adversary.)Maya: So... do you think Pierce did it?Phoenix: It's too early to say anything at this point. But I do think he's still hiding something.Larry: NIIIIIICK! Why didn't you pin everything on Sorin Loser back there?!Phoenix: (Looks like Larry still hasn't given up on Ellen...)Larry: If this Pierce guy is the real bad guy... ...then Sorin and my Elly will live happily ever after together!Phoenix: Larry... that's not the kind of thing a decent human being says...Maya: Shame on you, Larry!Larry: Oh, booo-hoooo! Y-You think I don't know?! I know I have to give up on my Elly... But, Nick...! Promise you'll make her happy! She deserves a \"happily ever after\"!Phoenix: (Uh, I'm sure Sorin will make her happy, once all of this is said and done...)Bailiff: The trial is about to resume, Mr. Wright.Phoenix: All right. You ready, Maya?Maya: Yup! Let's go!Larry: I'll be rooting for you, Nick!September 23District Court - Courtroom No. 6Judge: This court is now back in session. ......Witness, please take the stand.Judge: Please state your name and occupation.Nichody: My name is Pierce Nichody. I am the Sprocket family butler.Phoenix: Let's get straight to the point, Mr. Nichody. Someone tore out a page from Mr. Sprocket's notebook to manipulate his memories. And that person was you... wasn't it?Nichody: ......That is correct. What about it?Phoenix: (Well, that was easy!) So why did you do it?! Why did you tamper with Mr. Sprocket's notebook?!Nichody: Please allow me to explain. It pains me to do this, but I will tell you the truth.Phoenix: It pains you...?Nichody: ...That is correct. For my testimony will go against Master Sorin's wishes.Phoenix: (Sorin's wishes? What is he talking about?)Witness Testimony-- Why I Tore Out the Page --Nichody: I rushed to the vista deck, but the crime had already been committed. I saw Miss Ellen and Gloomsbury collapsed, and Master Sorin writing in his notebook. Master Sorin said to me, \"I'll take the blame for the murder, so please take care of Ellen.\" But I went against his order. I tore the page out of his notebook, and hid the body.Phoenix: Wait a second...! What Mr. Sprocket was writing in his notebook at the time -- could it be...? (It was meant to be a confession -- an admission he'd killed Gloomsbury himself!) He wrote that message to take the blame for Ms. Wyatt?!Nichody: That is correct. Master Sorin did hit Gloomsbury with the Time Keeper to save Miss Ellen...Phoenix: Then Mr. Sprocket was the culprit after all!Nichody: However, that blow did not kill Gloomsbury.Edgeworth: That makes sense. Mr. Sprocket's injury wouldn't allow him to put much force into it.Nichody: Enraged, Gloomsbury tried to attack Master Sorin, who was already seriously wounded. But just in the nick of time, Miss Ellen hit Gloomsbury from behind... ...and finished him off, it would seem.Edgeworth: So the one who inflicted the fatal blow was the defendant?Nichody: ...Yes, that is correct. But Master Sorin tried to take all of the blame onto himself.Maya: N-No way...! This... is pretty bad, Nick.Phoenix: No kidding... (\"Pretty bad\" is an understatement...!)Edgeworth: Well, well, Mr. Wright. It seems your decision to call for Mr. Nichody has backfired. For the true culprit behind this case remains the defendant, Ellen Wyatt!Phoenix: Arngh! (Could this get any worse?! But Pierce was involved in the cover-up plot... And I bet he still has something to hide!)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Why I Tore Out the Page --Nichody: I rushed to the vista deck, but the crime had already been committed.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait a minute. I thought you went to the vista deck with Mr. Sprocket? Nichody: ...Actually, that is not true. Phoenix: What? What do you mean? Nichody: I found this out afterward, but... ...Master Sorin went to the vista deck alone. He went out the escape hatch in the reception hall, and went along the outside wall. Judge: WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Edgeworth: You can't be serious! You mean, Mr. Wright's addlepated guess was actually correct?! Phoenix: What's with the \"addlepated\"?! Judge: I suppose truth really is stranger than fiction! Phoenix: So, Mr. Nichody... When you got to the scene, you saw Mr. Gloomsbury, Ms. Wyatt... ...and Mr. Sprocket. Is that right? Nichody: That is exactly right.Nichody: I saw Miss Ellen and Gloomsbury collapsed, and Master Sorin writing in his notebook.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So when you and your group arrived at the vista deck... ...the murder had already been committed? Nichody: ...That is correct. Gloomsbury had already been struck. Miss Ellen had lost consciousness, probably from the shock of the incident. Phoenix: ...And how did Mr. Sprocket appear? Nichody: He was bleeding from the stab wound he'd received from Gloomsbury. Barely conscious, he was writing something in his notebook. Phoenix: (So the mysterious third person Ellen saw really was Sorin, then...?)Nichody: Master Sorin said to me, \"I'll take the blame for the murder, so please take care of Ellen.\"Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So Mr. Sprocket wrote a note of confession in order to take the blame for Ms. Wyatt? Nichody: Yes. That notebook is the only form of memory Master Sorin has. So you understand what his action meant, I trust? Phoenix: ............ Maya: Wh-What did it mean, Nick? Phoenix: To Sorin, everything in that notebook is true. So Sorin tried to take the blame... ...by altering his own memory to make himself think he did it. Maya: No... Nichody: Master Sorin truly loves Miss Ellen. It must have been love that made him do that.Nichody: But I went against his order. I tore the page out of his notebook, and hid the body.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Mr. Nichody, could you please tell this court about that in more detail? Nichody: \"That,\" you say? Which part do you mean, Mr. Wright? Could you be more specific? Phoenix: Oh, uh... all right. (What part do I want to know more about?) Hiding the body Phoenix: Please tell me more about the hiding of the body. Nichody: ...Very well. After saying he would take the blame, Master Sorin passed out. That's when I hid the body. I quickly took the lift down to the hold... ...where I hid Gloomsbury's still-warm body in the spare Pegabull lantern. Phoenix: So it was you who hid the body, not the defendant? Nichody: To think Mr. Butz would move the lantern containing the body to the reception hall... Well, I did not see that coming. Phoenix: (I don't blame you. Not even Larry can predict what Larry will do next... Maybe I should take another look at the lantern in evidence...) Judge: Mr. Wright, would you like that statement added to the witness's testimony? Add to testimony Phoenix: Yes, please. Judge: Very well. Please add that statement to your testimony, Mr. Nichody. Adds statement \"In the hold, I hid the still-warm body in the spare Pegabull lantern.\" or changes statement from \"I tore the page out of the notebook in order to protect Master Sorin.\" to \"In the hold, I hid the still-warm body in the spare Pegabull lantern.\" Not necessary Phoenix: No, I guess not, Your Honor. (I'd better be a bit more cautious here.) Judge: No? All right. Very well. Leads back to cross-examination Hiding the body (after adding statement \"In the hold, I hid the still-warm body in the spare Pegabull lantern.\") Phoenix: Please tell me more about the hiding of the body. Nichody: ...Very well. After saying he would take the blame, Master Sorin passed out. That's when I hid the body. I quickly took the lift down to the hold... ...where I hid Gloomsbury's still-warm body in the spare Pegabull lantern. Phoenix: So it was you who hid the body, not the defendant? Nichody: To think Mr. Butz would move the lantern containing the body to the reception hall... Well, I did not see that coming. Phoenix: (I don't blame you. Not even Larry can predict what Larry will do next... Maybe I should take another look at the lantern in evidence...) Leads back to cross-examination Tearing out the page Phoenix: Why did you go against Mr. Sprocket's order and tear out the page? Nichody: ...That is a silly question. As I told you before... Disposing of anything that may harm the Sprocket family's reputation... ...is simply a part of my job. Phoenix: Oh, right. You did say that before, didn't you. Nichody: I tore the page out of the notebook in order to protect Master Sorin. Judge: Mr. Wright, would you like that statement added to the witness's testimony? Add to testimony Phoenix: Yes, please. Judge: Very well. Please add that statement to your testimony, Mr. Nichody. Adds statement \"I tore the page out of the notebook in order to protect Master Sorin.\" or changes statement from \"In the hold, I hid the still-warm body in the spare Pegabull lantern.\" to \"I tore the page out of the notebook in order to protect Master Sorin.\" Not necessary Phoenix: No, I guess not, Your Honor.

Leads back to cross-examination Tearing out the page (after adding statement \"I tore the page out of that notebook in order to protect Master Sorin.\") Phoenix: Why did you go against Mr. Sprocket's order and tear out the page? Nichody: ...That is a silly question. As I told you before... Disposing of anything that may harm the Sprocket family's reputation... ...is simply a part of my job. Phoenix: Oh, right. You did say that before, didn't you. Nichody: I tore the page out of the notebook in order to protect Master Sorin. Leads back to cross-examinationNichody: In the hold, I hid the still-warm body in the spare Pegabull lantern.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why did you hide the body in the lantern? Nichody: As I told you yesterday, it was to make it as though the murder never happened. But thanks to Mr. Butz, things did not turn out as planned. Phoenix: So holding the second wedding reception wasn't Mr. Sprocket's idea... ...but yours, wasn't it? Nichody: It was all for Master Sorin's sake... and Sprocket Aviation. If I am accused of a crime for trying to cover up the incident... ...I shall accept it willingly. Phoenix: (He really doesn't seem to even care about himself!)Present Broken Lantern Phoenix: Leads to: \"(C-Could it be...? Is that what happened...?)\"Nichody: I tore the page out of that notebook in order to protect Master Sorin.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, by tearing the page out of the notebook... ...you erased the memory of Mr. Sprocket, who was trying to take the fall for Ms. Wyatt. Nichody: I knew it went against his wishes... ...but I just could not let Master Sorin bear the blame for something he did not do. As his butler, I believe that was the right decision for me to make. Phoenix: (It was all for Sorin's benefit, huh? I bet Pierce would do just about anything in the name of keeping Sorin's image \"safe\"...)Before adding either statement Phoenix: This testimony of Pierce's... I wonder how much of it we can actually believe. Maya: Yeah. Who knows what parts are true and what parts are more spun tales? Phoenix: Exactly. But we can't just stand around mulling it all over. We have to try and draw information out of him, and see if there are any contradictions!After adding either statement Maya: So he's talking about the cover-up after the incident, huh? Phoenix: Right. That's information only somebody who was actually involved could know. Maya: So it might be a really important piece of testimony! Phoenix: I think so, too. I'll really have to tread carefully here.\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Trucy Wright\nDescription: My adopted daughter.

    "cot": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking me to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other in the given case. The testimonies are from Pierce Nichody, and the evidence includes various items like the Broken Lantern, Candelabra, etc.\n\nLooking at the testimonies, testimony 4 says Nichody hid the body in the spare Pegabull lantern in the hold. The Broken Lantern (evidence 5) is described as the Pegabull lantern where the body was found, but there's a bloodstain on the inside wheel handle. If Nichody placed the body in the lantern, the bloodstain inside suggests the body was already bleeding when placed there. However, the Autopsy Report (evidence 14) states the victim was killed by two blows from the Time Keeper, which might not produce much blood. But the key contradiction here is that the Broken Lantern's bloodstain inside implies the body was placed there while still bleeding, but if Nichody moved the body after the murder, the blood would have come from the victim's head wounds. However, the Candelabra (evidence 17) has bloodstains matching the lift bloodstain, which is from Sorin's injury, not the victim. So maybe the blood inside the lantern is from Sorin, not the victim, which contradicts Nichody's testimony that he hid the body. Wait, but the Broken Lantern's blood is from the victim's body being placed inside. But if the victim's wounds were from blunt force, maybe there wasn't much blood. The contradiction could be that the bloodstain on the lantern's handle is from Sorin's injury, not the victim's, implying Nichody is lying about how the body was placed there. Alternatively, the handle's bloodstain being inside the lantern suggests someone with bloody hands placed the body there, which would be Sorin, not Nichody. But according to testimony 4, Nichody moved the body. If Nichody's hands weren't bloody, then the blood on the handle must be from someone else, contradicting his testimony. So the Broken Lantern (evidence 5) contradicts testimony 4 because the bloodstain inside implies the person moving the body had a bleeding wound, which would be Sorin, not Nichody. Therefore, Nichody's claim that he hid the body is contradicted by the blood evidence from Sorin's injury."

A thick fog billows across the room, making it look as if the couple were walking on clouds. Maya: Wow... Look at how beautiful Ellen is here! She looks a little nervous, though. Phoenix: She does, doesn't she. Maya: Hey, look! There's Pierce! Phoenix: Really? Where? Maya: Right there, behind the sweetheart table! Phoenix: Hey, you're right. I bet he was there attending to the happy couple the whole dinner. Maya: So, what do you think, Nick? Does anything in this photo stick out at you? Phoenix: No, not at the moment, anyway. Photo of Reception added to the Court Record. Maya: Hey, Nick? If Ellen really did travel back in time... ...do you think this photo is of the second reception -- you know, after the time jump? Phoenix: Hmm... I wonder. Excuse me. Sir? Man: Yes? Can I help you? Phoenix: Ellen told us she traveled back in time. Would you happen to know anything about that? Man: Oh, um... N-No... I-I... I-I haven't the foggiest idea what you're talking about! Phoenix: ? (He clammed up faster than a clam!) Film camera or photos on table (subsequent times) Phoenix: You don't see cameras like this anymore. Maya: That's for sure! Cameras these days are so small and easy to use. But these old retro ones are cool, too! Man: I'm glad to hear you appreciate them. *ahem* This camera was made in the late 1800s. As for this particular model, it is... Phoenix: S-Sorry! We'd really like to hear more about your camera, but we have to go. Maya: Aww, Nick! But it sounds so interesting! Phoenix: We have to get back to our investigation, remember? (Preferably before we get our ears talked off!) Man: Oh, what a shame. We'll have to get together and talk some other time, then. Over tea, perhaps? Card on floor Phoenix: Excuse me, but there's a card here on the floor. Man: Well, look at that. It's a Flying Chapel key card. Phoenix: The Flying Chapel? What areas on the Flying Chapel require a key card, if I may ask? Man: Mostly areas we want to keep the public out of... ...such as the staff room and the hold, which is chock full of machinery. Phoenix: So you can't enter those areas without a key card? Man: That's right... Hm? This one here belongs to Ellen. Phoenix: (Wait, what's Ellen's key card doing here?) Did Ellen come back here after the incident occurred? Man: I don't believe so. And she was arrested by the police straight away this morning. Although... there was a strange man with a gaudy jacket in here earlier. Phoenix: Was that man... wearing a beret, by any chance? Man: Yes, he was, as a matter of fact! He was also wearing sunglasses and a fake mustache! Phoenix: (I knew it... The only question is, what was he doing here?) Card on floor (subsequent times) Phoenix: Um... Would you like me to pick up that key card? It's pretty important, isn't it? Man: No, that's all right. I'm waiting for that new maid over there to notice it. Phoenix: I-I see. Man: It's a part of our training process for new servants, so please don't help her. Don't worry. I'll keep an eye on the key card. Phoenix: All right... (The Sprocket household sure runs a tight airship...) Framed photo Maya: Hey, Nick! Now, here's a real lady! Phoenix: She looks smart as a whip, doesn't she? Maya: I wonder who she is? We didn't see her on the airship... Man: That is Selena Sprocket... Sorin's elder sister. Beautiful and capable, she was a great lady. Phoenix: Sorin's sister... Hmm... I think I see the resemblance. (Maybe I'll show Pierce this photo later and ask him about her.) Selena Sprocket Photo added to the Court Record. Framed photo (subsequent times) Maya: Hey, Nick! Now, here's a real lady! Phoenix: She looks smart as a whip, doesn't she? Maya: I wonder who she is? We didn't see her on the airship... Man: That is Selena Sprocket... Sorin's elder sister. Beautiful and capable, she was a great lady. Phoenix: Sorin's sister... Hmm... I think I see the resemblance. Talk The incident Nichody: About the incident Miss Ellen was arrested for... ...do you think she did it? Phoenix: Well, I can't prove it yet, but no, I don't think she could've done it. I guess you could call it a gut feeling. Nichody: ...... I see. I guess we have different opinions, then. Phoenix: Do we, now? Nichody: The prosecution says that when Gloomsbury attacked Miss Ellen, she fought back... ...and ended up killing him. I agree with this perspective. Or rather, that is the consensus of the entire Sprocket family. Phoenix: ...Even so, I heard an interesting story from Chief Prosecutor Edgeworth. I heard that the Sprocket family had tried to pressure the Prosecutor's Office... ...into burying this case. Nichody: I fear you are mistaken. All we sought was merely a legal consultation. Besides, none of it matters now, as she is no longer a part of this family. Fortunately for us, they had yet to get their marriage license before holding the banquet. Phoenix: (So basically, once they realized they couldn't sway the prosecution, they cut her loose...) Nichody: ......I realize how callous I must sound. But my duty is to protect the Sprocket family, and more specifically... ...Sprocket Aviation's future and Master Sorin, whose genius is essential to the company. I will do anything to achieve that goal. That is my job as the Sprocket family butler. Maya: You know, I think Pierce and Mr. Edgeworth would get along really well. Don't you think? Phoenix: Yeah. I could easily picture Edgeworth with a butler. Nichody: Oh, and by the way... I suppose I should tell you about this as well... It's about when the members of the extended family and I discovered the crime. Time travel Phoenix: Um, did Ellen say anything to you about traveling through time? Nichody: ...She must have been delirious. There is no need to take such a claim seriously. Phoenix: Sorin himself said that time travel was possible, though. Nichody: ! ......Master Sorin... said that? ......It sounds like he is still stuck in the past. Phoenix: (He's psychologically stuck, I take it...) *ring* *ring* Nichody: Excuse me. What is it? ............I see. I believe I told you the madam will be having milk tea. Still, have lemon slices at the ready, just in case. We must not disappoint her, understand? Phoenix: You sure are busy. Nichody: All in a day's work. ...Still, we really do need Master Sorin to start focusing on the business side of things soon. Phoenix: Um, could you tell us about that thing you mentioned about Sorin's past? Nichody: There is something in Master Sorin's past that he wishes he could change... Please forgive me. This isn't something I should be sharing with strangers. Phoenix: (Now I really want to know what Sorin's still hung up on...) Discovering the crime (appears after \"The incident\") Nichody: It was sometime after the reception. Some of the master's relatives and I went to clean up the reception hall... ...and that is when we saw it. A woman standing in front of the victim with the bloody murder weapon in her hand... It was none other than Miss Ellen. Phoenix: But, Pierce, it wasn't what it looked like! Maya: That's right! She just happened to find the body! Nichody: I do not know what Miss Ellen has told you, but what we witnessed... ... was unmistakably the moment immediately after the deed had been committed. Phoenix: Nngh... Nichody: And that is what I told the police who came in response to my call. Phoenix: I-I see... (So Pierce was the one who reported it to the police, huh?) Sorin's past (appears after presenting Selena Sprocket Photo) Nichody: Master Sorin will become the next president of Sprocket Aviation. However, that wasn't always so. Miss Selena Sprocket, Master Sorin's elder sister, was next in line. Maya: So why isn't she becoming the next president? Nichody: ......Because she died... in a car accident. Maya: What?! Phoenix: I-I had no idea...! Nichody: Actually, Master Sorin was also in the car with her at the time of the accident. Losing the sister he loved right before his eyes devastated him. Ever since then, he has buried himself in his research on time machines. He also became a quiet and meticulous -- almost compulsive -- note-taker around then. Maya: He seems so stiff and robotic -- I had no idea he was carrying all that around inside him... Nichody: Master Sorin has abandoned the company business and spends all his time on inventions. As the family butler, I am truly concerned. I believe it is high time he let go of the past. Present Ellen's Pendant or Time Keeper Nichody: Master Sorin made the Time Keeper as a symbol of their love for each other. ...A symbol now tainted with blood. I can only imagine how shocking this must be for Master Sorin. Phoenix: But surely Sorin believes in the woman he loves. Nichody: Master Sorin has the future of Sprocket Aviation to think about. He cannot afford to let his personal feelings affect his judgment. Phoenix: Th-That's awful! Nichody: You might think so, but that's the kind of responsibility he must bear. Phoenix: (All because he's in line to be the next president, huh? Sounds like it's not going to be easy to find out how Sorin really feels about anything...) Flying Chapel Pamphlet or Photo of Reception Nichody: This incident has severely damaged the company's reputation. I expect reservations for weddings on the Flying Chapel will face an unfortunate decline. Phoenix: Pierce, you just lost a subordinate... ...yet, all you can think about is the business? Nichody: I am not made of stone, I assure you. But if this company were to go under because of this incident... ...countless employees would lose their jobs. Phoenix: I-I see... Nichody: To be honest, I wish we could have hidden this tragedy from the public... ...but now that it's going to trial, I suppose there is nothing to be done about it. Phoenix: (So the fate of this company depends on this trial... This is more than I bargained for...) Photo of Victim or Gloomsbury's Note Nichody: Gloomsbury... How could he do something so deranged? It is truly a shame. As a servant, he was a cut above the rest. Phoenix: Mr. Gloomsbury worked under you, correct? Were there any signs that he was going to do anything like that to Ellen? Nichody: No, he gave no indication whatsoever. If only I'd realized what he was up to sooner... Phoenix: I-I see... Selena Sprocket Photo Phoenix: Pierce, the woman in this photo is Sorin's older sister Selena, right? I don't think we've met her yet. Nichody: Yes, about that... Phoenix: (He seems... hesitant, all of a sudden.) If you wouldn't mind... ...could you tell us about her? Nichody: A-All right. Very well. She's a big part of Master Sorin's past, after all... Phoenix: Sorin's... past? Anything else Nichody: And what is this? Phoenix: Just wondering if there is anything you can tell me about it. Nichody: Hmm... I'm afraid not. Phoenix: I-I see. Nichody: Time is money, as they say, so perhaps you should learn to spend it more wisely. Phoenix: R-Right. (Good advice, but his chilly attitude is giving me some serious goose bumps...) After clearing all Talk options and examining bouquet, film camera or photos on table, and card on floor: ???: Hey, Nick! What are you doing here? Phoenix: Larry? Larry: Oh, man! Edgey gave me a heckuva hard time! Phoenix: Larry, what are YOU doing here? Larry: I came to promote my new character, Cupiglet! I was hoping Sprocket Aviation would do some kind of tie-in with me for it! Maya: Wow. I didn't know Larry was such an aggressive businessman. You could learn a thing or two from him, Nick. Why don't you promote your agency to them? Phoenix: Now's not exactly the time for that, in case you haven't noticed. Maya: See? And this is why you'll never be rich! Phoenix: Actually, Larry, I've been meaning to ask you something. You were on the Flying Chapel yesterday, right? Larry: Huh? Was I...? Er... Phoenix: What were you doing there? Larry: N-Nothing... Phoenix: Whatever it was, I bet it wasn't anything to be proud of. But never mind that. Did you see anything that had to do with the case? ......Scratch that. Let's start with, you weren't INVOLVED in this case, were you? Larry: ! ............ Phoenix: Larry...? Maya: Hey! He took off! Phoenix: I just knew it... When something smells, it's usually the Butz... Come on, Maya! After him! Nichody: Oh, are you leaving so soon? Phoenix: We, uh, have to run... Thank you for making time for us. Nichody: I know you have to investigate, but please try to spare the family's feelings as you do. Phoenix: Y-Yes, of course. September 21Sprocket Park - Mooring Dock Phoenix: There he is. Hey, Larry! Larry: H-Hey, there, friend! Fancy meeting you here! Phoenix: There's nothing \"fancy\" about it. All we did was follow you. So, tell me, Larry. Why did you run away like that? Larry: Huh? Me? ...I don't know what you're talking about. A bolt of inspiration for my new picture book hit me and I had to run is all. It was, like, a \"Cupiphany!\" You dig? Phoenix: Riiiiight... Maya: He's just going to keep on playing dumb, isn't he, Nick? Talk What you saw on the airship Phoenix: Come on, Larry. I know you were on that airship, so what did you see? Larry: I-I didn't see anything! I didn't see anything 'cause I was never on that stupid airship! 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: ! Psyche-Locks... Larry: You say something? Phoenix: (The spiritual power of this magatama allows me to see... ...these mystical locks that appear when someone is trying to hide something from me. They're called \"Psyche-Locks,\" and when I see them... ...I simply present the magatama ([X / Y / R]) to try my hand at breaking them. (Changed from [...I simply touch the magatama (X) to try my hand at breaking them.] in the original release) If I can unlock them, I'm sure to finally get a straight answer out of him!) Present Magatama Phoenix: 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- What Larry Is Hiding -- Phoenix: This is no time for games, Larry. I WILL find out what you're hiding. Larry: I'm telling ya, Nick, you've got it all wrong. I've got nothing to do with this case, whatsoever! Phoenix: (Oh, come on, Larry! Even a baby could see through such a blatant and obvious lie.) \"Nothing whatsoever,\" huh? If you weren't involved, Larry, then you wouldn't have been involved with this person. Present Ellen Wyatt profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"You're the one who brought Ellen to my office in the first place.\" Present anyone else Phoenix: Larry: Huh? What are you trying to say, Nick? Phoenix: (Oops. Looks like I got it wrong.) J-Just ignore I said that! Larry: Jeez. Get a grip, will ya? Leads back to: \"If you weren't involved, Larry, then you wouldn't have been involved with this person.\" Phoenix: You're the one who brought Ellen to my office in the first place. ...And all those cops. Larry: Um... Phoenix: \"Nothing to do with the case, whatsoever\" isn't gonna cut it this time, Larry! If you have to lie, at least do a better job of it! Larry: U... UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! 1 LOCK BROKEN Larry: D-Don't diss me, Nick! If you're so convinced I'm lying, then lemme ask you this! What makes you think I was on that stupid ol' airship, anyway?! Lemme see some proof! If you've got any! Phoenix: Doubling down, are you? Fine. You want proof, Larry? Here's proof that you were on that airship! Present Business Card Wallet Phoenix: Leads to: \"Uh-oh!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Larry: You call that proof? Hmph. Phoenix: (Argh! I must've gotten it wrong!) Larry: Seriously, Nick. You shouldn't doubt your friends like this. It only hurts the both of us. Phoenix: (I'd better try that again.) Leads back to: \"You want proof, Larry? Here's proof that you were on that airship!\" Larry: Uh-oh! Phoenix: This is your business card wallet, isn't it, Larry? I found it in the reception hall. Larry: Gah! Phoenix: Time to come clean, Larry Butz. What exactly are you hiding? Larry: W-WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! ...... A-All right! Fine! Ya got me! I'll tell you everything! 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful What you saw on the airship (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Phoenix: Larry, what were you doing on that airship, anyway? Larry: Well, I went there to deliver the \"Welcome to Our Wedding\" sign they ordered from me. Phoenix: Huh. I didn't know you took on real jobs like that, too. Larry: Well, for your information, my wedding welcome signs are very popular on the Net! Phoenix: And that's how you met Ellen? Larry: Uh-huh. I mean, I'd seen her in the photo for the welcome sign, but seeing her in person... The way she smiled at me and said, \"Thank you\"... *sigh* I felt like I'd been hit by lightning! Phoenix: And that's when you fell in love with somebody else's bride, huh? So, were you invited to the reception? Larry: Can you believe they told me only family and relatives could attend?! They wouldn't even let me into the reception hall! Phoenix: (Smart move on their part, I'd say.) Larry: I got upset, and started wandering around the airship. That must be when I dropped my business card wallet. Phoenix: (So somebody else must've found it... ...and brought it to the reception hall, then.) Larry: But you know what? I saw something incredible while I was on that Flying Chapel! Phoenix: Like...? Larry: Get a load of this! Phoenix: Wh-What the heck is this? Larry: Whaddaya mean, \"what is this\"? Isn't it obvious? It's a drawing! I sketched a picture of one of the cabins on the airship. Phoenix: So what's so incredible about a cabin? Larry: Look at what was outside the window! It's one of those flying dinosaurs -- a real live pterodactyl! I looked out the cabin window and there it was, just flying out there! That airship traveled through time, I tell you! Phoenix: Wh-Wh... Maya: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Larry: When I told that Pierce butler guy about it... ...he told me to never mention it to anybody ever again. Phoenix: But why would he try to keep you from spouting what is clearly just nonsense? Larry: Maybe Sprocket Aviation is secretly developing a time machine! Phoenix: ......N-No way... Maya: N-Nick, this case is... ...totally amazing! Larry! You didn't tell Mr. Edgeworth about this, did you? Larry: Of course not! Edgey would just roll his eyes and think I was off my rocker. I didn't even tell him I was wandering around on the airship. I told him I met Elly at the mooring dock and we ran away together. Phoenix: Yeah... I can see Edgeworth's eyes rolling right out of his head had he heard about this. Larry's Drawing added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (So Larry also experienced the time slip somehow... But how is that possible...?) Larry: Hey, Nick. I'll be taking my card wallet back now, if you don't mind. Business Card Wallet swiped back by Larry. Larry: Oh, yeah. This is for you. Phoenix: What is it? Larry: It's a picture of the hold. I took it when I was wandering around on the airship. See? There's Elly right there in the middle. Phoenix: Um, the hold? Larry: Yeah, see? It's right here on the diagram. Phoenix: Okay. So now I know where the hold is. But what was Ellen doing there? Larry: Well, they were using it as a prepping area for the reception. Phoenix: I see. And around when did you take this? Larry: Before the reception. I took it while Elly was getting everything ready. Phoenix: So this was taken before the incident occurred... I don't know if it'll be of any help, but thanks for this anyway. Photo of Hold added to the Court Record. Phoenix: By the way, Larry. I heard that the door to the hold is controlled by a security system. So how'd you get in there? Larry: Th-That's...! A trade secret! Can't tell ya! Phoenix: (And the hits just keep on coming...) Well, I guess that's basically a wrap on the investigation. Maya: Not quite, Nick! I want to meet Ellen, too! Phoenix: Oh, that's right. You haven't met her yet, have you? Okay. Let's head over to the detention center, so you can say hi. What you saw on the airship (subsequent times) Phoenix: Larry, what were you doing on that airship, anyway? Larry: Well, I went there to deliver the \"Welcome to Our Wedding\" sign they ordered from me. Phoenix: Huh. I didn't know you took on real jobs like that, too. Larry: Well, for your information, my wedding welcome signs are very popular on the Net! Phoenix: And that's how you met Ellen? Larry: Uh-huh. I mean, I'd seen her in the photo for the welcome sign, but seeing her in person... The way she smiled at me and said, \"Thank you\"... *sigh* I felt like I'd been hit by lightning! Phoenix: And that's when you fell in love with somebody else's bride, huh? So, were you invited to the reception? Larry: Can you believe they told me only family and relatives could attend?! They wouldn't even let me into the reception hall! Phoenix: (Smart move on their part, I'd say.) Larry: I got upset, and started wandering around the airship. That must be when I dropped my business card wallet. Phoenix: (So somebody else must've found it... ...and brought it to the reception hall, then.) Larry: But you know what? I saw something incredible while I was on that Flying Chapel! Phoenix: Like...? Larry: Get a load of this! Phoenix: Wh-What the heck is this? Larry: Whaddaya mean, \"what is this\"? Isn't it obvious? It's a drawing! I sketched a picture of one of the cabins on the airship. Phoenix: So what's so incredible about a cabin? Larry: Look at what was outside the window! It's one of those flying dinosaurs -- a real live pterodactyl! I looked out the cabin window and there it was, just flying out there! That airship traveled through time, I tell you! Phoenix: Wh-Wh... Maya: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Larry: When I told that Pierce butler guy about it... ...he told me to never mention it to anybody ever again. Phoenix: But why would he try to keep you from spouting what is clearly just nonsense? Larry: Maybe Sprocket Aviation is secretly developing a time machine! Phoenix: ......N-No way... Maya: N-Nick, this case is... ...totally amazing! Larry! You didn't tell Mr. Edgeworth about this, did you? Larry: Of course not! Edgey would just roll his eyes and think I was off my rocker. I didn't even tell him I was wandering around on the airship. I told him I met Elly at the mooring dock and we ran away together. Phoenix: Yeah... I can see Edgeworth's eyes rolling right out of his head had he heard about this. Present Business Card Wallet Phoenix: I found this in the reception hall. Larry: ........... Say, that's a pretty stylish wallet, ain't it? Phoenix: Have you ever seen it before? Larry: ............Nope. Phoenix: (I'll take that as a \"yes\"... Which means he must be trying to hide something from me.) Larry: I-I don't know anything about that wallet! Phoenix: (I'll just have to take him to task later...) Selena Sprocket Photo Larry: Whoooooooa! Who is she? Who is this lovely vision? Phoenix: Larry... *sigh* This is Sorin's older sister. She died in a car accident. Larry: Nooooooooo! How could such a beautiful flame have been snuffed out like that?! If she were alive today, I bet I could've made her happy. Phoenix: That's funny. I thought you were in love with Ellen? Larry: Don't get me wrong, Nick. I just wanna make all the pretty ladies of this world happy, that's all! Phoenix: I-I think you're the one getting it wrong... Anything else (before breaking Psyche-Locks) Larry: Hm? Do you really think you can prove Elly's innocence with that? Phoenix: If I knew, I wouldn't need to conduct an investigation, now would I? Now, look at the evidence, Larry! Can you tell me anything about it? Larry: Hmm.... Hmmmmmmmmmmm... Hmm... Nope. Sorry! Can't think of a thing. Phoenix: (Good thing I had low expectations from the start then...) Business Card Wallet (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Larry: All right, I admit it! That super stylish business card wallet is mine! What more do you want outta me?! ...Wait. Don't tell me you were hoping to keep it for yourself? Phoenix: Why would I want a card wallet with your face on it?! Larry: Aww, don't be shy! Tell you what, Nick. I'll have one sent to your office. I'll even throw in a \"good friend discount\" on it, too. Phoenix: I'd still have to pay?! (Trucy's going to take it out of my hide, too, once she sees that in the expenses book.) Larry's Drawing Larry: Hey! That's the drawing I made. You'd better take care of it. I bet it's gonna be valuable some day! Oh, do you want me to add a character or something to it? Maya: Ooh, could you? I'd love to see a true artist at work! Phoenix: Hold it! As farcical as this drawing is, there will be no doodling on the evidence until the trial is over. Larry: Wh-Whaddaya mean, \"farcical\"?! I'm never gonna draw anything for you ever again! Not even if you beg me! Maya: Aww... Guess that's that, huh, Nick? Phoenix: (Need I remind you that it's still a piece of evidence, Maya...?) Anything else (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Larry: What are you showing me that for? Is this an interrogation? Okay, sure, I snuck onto that airship and was wandering around it all by my lonesome. But you gotta believe me! I didn't kill anybody! Phoenix: And WHY were you sneaking around on that airship in the first place? Larry: Because... it was fate...? Yeah, that's it! I was just following my destiny! That's all I've ever done! Phoenix: (Oh, come on, Larry... Are you seriously going to blame all the trouble you've ever caused on fate?) Wright Anything Agency, Reception Hall, or Foyer Talk Any ideas? Phoenix: The internal affairs of a powerful and wealthy family... I get the feeling this is going to get messy. What are your thoughts, Maya? Maya: Hmm... Prestigious families like this tend to try and protect their reputation, don't they? Phoenix: Yeah. That's the thing. Maya: But at least YOU don't have much of a reputation to protect. That means you can do anything you want to win this case! Phoenix: Who says I don't have a reputation to protect?! What to do Phoenix: I still can't help but wonder... You know this time travel thing Ellen keeps talking about... Do you think it really happened? Maya: Oh, I believe it happened! Phoenix: Y-You do?! Based on what? Maya: Well, it's not really based on anything, exactly... It's just that it's so much more fun to believe that it really happened! As soon as this case is over, I'm going to go talk with Sorin Sprocket myself. I'm going to ask him to send me back to medieval times! Phoenix: W-Well, I guess it's nice to have a dream... (Just please don't let the fantasy of time travel turn real in this case...) Present Larry's Drawing Maya: Larry's a really good artist, isn't he? No wonder he's a famous picture book author! Phoenix: Well, he's really good at something all right. Namely, at causing trouble wherever he goes. Maya: But he's also helped you out of a bind or two before, right? Phoenix: I guess so... (But that's not usually until after he's made a mess of things first...) After clearing \"What you saw on the airship\" Talk option in Sprocket Park - Mooring Dock: September 21Detention Center - Visitor's Room Ellen: No! Why?! ???: Please understand that this is in Master Sorin's best interest. Phoenix: (Sounds like Ellen's busy talking with someone...) Nichody: The next president cannot be married to a criminal. It would disgrace Sprocket Aviation. Miss Ellen, I need you to forget about this marriage. Phoenix: Pardon us... Nichody: ! ...If it isn't Mr. Wright. Phoenix: So... their marriage is definitely off? Nichody: There is no other choice. We cannot have a criminal in the family. For the sake of Master Sorin and the Sprocket family, this is what is best. Ellen: *sniffle* Nooooo... Maya: ... Um... in that case... ...what if Nick here proved Ellen's innocence? Then you wouldn't have a criminal in the family, right?! Nichody: ! ......I-I suppose you are right, but I am afraid that will be impossible. Maya: That's not true! Not for Nick. He may look like a nobody, but he can do some pretty amazing things! Phoenix: ......I don't take cases on lightly, so rest assured, I will prove her innocence. Nichody: Mr. Phoenix Wright... I understand your name is quite well-known in the judicial world... For better or for worse. Phoenix: ...Pierce, I want you to promise me this: If I can prove Ellen's innocence... ...then you won't stand in the way of Sorin and Ellen's marriage. Nichody: ......Hmph. Very well. But not even the most talented lawyer in the world can change reality itself. And the reality is, Miss Ellen is guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt. Phoenix: I believe that's where you're wrong, Pierce. Ellen: I'm clean! I swear I am! Obsessively, compulsively, clean! Just as clean and pure as this pure-white dress! Nichody: ...Fine. You have my word. But you will be the one to regret this promise. ......Now, if you will excuse me. Phoenix: (...Now I have all the more reason to win this case.) Ellen, we finished our investigation, and we'd like to talk with you about what we found. Ellen: Okay! So what did you find out? Talk Investigation results Phoenix: In the course of our investigation, we heard that... ...you had been standing in front of the victim with the murder weapon in your hands. Ellen: ! I-It wasn't what it looked like! It's true I was holding the murder weapon... ...but when I found him, he was already dead. I-I panicked... ...and I was hoping I could go back in time again, like I had done earlier. So I picked up the Time Keeper from the pedestal and brought it over without thinking. Phoenix: You were so desperate, you were ready to try anything, huh... Unfortunately, that sort of behavior makes you an easy target for the prosecution. Ellen: No... Phoenix: And as for your little trip through time... ...none of your in-laws could confirm your story, I'm afraid. Ellen: I... I see... Phoenix: The only exception is Larry. He said he saw something. Ellen: Really? Wh-What did he see? Time travel (appears after \"Investigation results\") Leads to: \"Can't say I quite believe it myself, but Larry claims he saw something incredible.\" Present Ellen's Pendant, Flying Chapel Pamphlet, Broken Lantern, Time Keeper, or Photo of Reception Ellen: Ooooooh... Phoenix: Wh-What's wrong? Ellen: I just remembered our reception... We were supposed to be so happy together! Oh, where did it all go wrong...? Phoenix: (I can't blame her for being upset.) Ellen: Why did this have to happen to me? UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Phoenix: E-Ellen! Please try to calm down! Okay?! Ellen: A-All right... Phoenix: (Well, she stopped crying, but... ...how can I ask her about anything when she's still so clearly distraught?) Photo of Victim Ellen: *gulp* Phoenix: A-Are you all right? Ellen: I-I... don't feel very well... Maya: Nick! That photo is a bit much for most normal people, you know! Phoenix: Y-Yeah, I guess you're right. (Oops, that was pretty inconsiderate of me...) Gloomsbury's Note Phoenix: Ellen, can you tell if this is Mr. Gloomsbury's handwriting? Ellen: No. I'm sorry. I'm not very familiar with his handwriting. Phoenix: I see... (And unless the handwriting is very distinct, I know it's often hard to tell.) Ellen: I-I'm sorry, but I'm not very comfortable with looking at a note which details... ...a plan on how to murder me written on it... Phoenix: Oh, sorry... I guess that should go without saying... Selena Sprocket Photo Ellen: *sniffle* Oh, poor Selena... I feel so sad about what happened to her...! SELENAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! Phoenix: Yikes! Ellen, please try to calm down! Pretty please? With sugar on top? Ellen: Sorin and I were supposed to be happy -- for Selena's sake, too. WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Maya: We... should probably leave this topic alone, Nick... Phoenix: Can't say I quite believe it myself, but Larry claims he saw something incredible. He claims he saw a pterodactyl flying outside the airship. Ellen: Wh... WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Phoenix: Not only that, but apparently Pierce Nichody told Larry to keep quiet about it. Ellen: But why would Pierce do such a thing? Maya: Larry's theory is that Sprocket Aviation is developing something in secret. A time machine, to be exact. Ellen: Do you think... Do you think that's why nobody would confirm my story? Because it's a secret? Phoenix: I-I really don't know. But speaking of your in-laws... ...we did manage to find your key card at Sprocket Manor. One of your in-laws said he'd keep an eye on it for you. Ellen: Oh, thank goodness! I lost it while I was getting things ready for the reception. I'd looked everywhere for it! I'm so glad you found iiiiiit! Phoenix: (A-At least they're tears of joy this time, for a change...) Maya: Well, Nick... It looks like you'll have to prove the existence of time travel in court tomorrow! Ellen: That's right! I swear that while Mr. Gloomsbury was being killed... ...I was busy traveling back through time! Phoenix: Great. With stodgy, skeptic Edgeworth at the helm for the prosecution tomorrow... ...we're really gonna have our work cut out for us. *sigh* To be continued Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: Nothing particularly interesting here. Area already examined Phoenix: (We've already searched here, but it never hurts to take another look around.) Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I think I'd better take a step back and gather my thoughts a little more...) Turnabout Time Traveler Image Gallery Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 September 22, 8:45 AMDistrict Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Ellen: Good morning, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Good morning, Ellen. I see you're still wearing your wedding gown. Ellen: And I will continue to wear it until our marriage is saved! ......... Oh! S-Sorin! Sorin: ............. Maya: Do you think he came to see how she's holding up? Ellen: Sorin, my love! You came all the way to the courthouse just to see me? Oh, Sorin! I don't know what to say! Sorin: ......Blueprints. Ellen: Huh? Sorin: The engine blueprints... I can't find them. Do you know where they are? Ellen: Oh! They're in your room, third shelf from the bottom, on the right-hand side. Sorin: ......Ah. I see. Phoenix: He's leaving already...? Maya: Don't tell me he came just to ask about some stupid blueprints? Is he really that cold of a person, or is that just how he comes off, I wonder... Ellen: *sniffle* Wh-What about me, Sorin...? Sorin: ......Ellen. Phoenix: (He's back.) Sorin: ............ ...Come home soon. ......I'm... lost without you. Ellen: ............S-S-S-Soriiiiiiiiiiiiin! Sorin: Later... Maya: Looks like showing your vulnerabilities is the fastest way to capturing a woman's heart. You should take notes on this, Nick. Phoenix: Please leave me out of this. (Anyway, it looks like Sorin isn't big on words... ...but it's clear that he cares about Ellen. Knowing that, I actually feel kind of relieved.) Ellen: Mr. Wright! I just absolutely CAN'T be found guilty, you hear! Phoenix: Don't worry. I'm going to do everything I can to prove your innocence. Ellen: THANK you, Mr. Wright! Bailiff: The trial is about to start, sir. Phoenix: (.........Edgeworth. Knowing him, he's not going to yield an inch. So I've just got to fight with everything I've got and save Ellen!) September 22, 9:00 AMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 6 Day 1Court Is Now In SessionAll Rise Judge: Court is now in session for the trial of Ellen Wyatt. Phoenix: The defense is ready, Your Honor. Edgeworth: The prosecution has been ready for a while, Your Honor. Judge: Seeing so many familiar faces gathered together like this... I feel as though I'm at a grand reunion. It makes me want to go out for dinner and a drink, and reminisce with all of you. Maya: Oh! That sounds like a great idea! I was dying for a real burger the whole time I was away! Phoenix: We could make it a welcome back party for Maya. How about it, Edgeworth? Edgeworth: .........I have no intention of cavorting with my enemies. Now then, Your Honor, let us start this trial at once. Judge: Ho ho. Still not one for lighthearted banter, are you, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Hmph. Jokes and good humor are beyond worthless in a court of law. Maya: Guess we'll just have to have the party without him, then. Edgeworth: ............ However, were it after the conclusion of this trial... ...I might consider joining you for your little welcome back party. I certainly wouldn't mind an invite, at the very least. Maya: ...He's still as emotionally constipated as ever, I see. Judge: Now then, Mr. Edgeworth, if you could please go over the details of this case for us. Edgeworth: The victim was Dumas Gloomsbury, a servant in the Sprocket household. He was in attendance at the wedding reception that occurred from 7 PM to 10 PM. Mr. Gloomsbury apparently felt some animosity toward Ellen Wyatt, and so... ...a bit after the reception ended at 10 PM, he assaulted Ms. Wyatt with the intent to kill her. The defendant fought back, and ended up killing Mr. Gloomsbury. Judge: Hmm... In other words... it was justified self-defense, correct? If that's the case, then the defendant might not be criminally responsible. Phoenix: (He's right... Worst-case scenario, I could go for self-defense to avoid the criminal charge. I wonder how Edgeworth plans to counter that, though...?) Edgeworth: ...The prosecution's first witness will make my view on the matter clear, Your Honor. Judge: Very well. Bailiff, please bring in the first witness. Edgeworth: Please state your name and occupation, witness. Ema: Ema Skye. Forensic investigator. A-And I'd just like to say, sir...! That being in the same courtroom as you is a great honor! Edgeworth: ......Hm? Phoenix: Oh, that's right... You're a fan of Edgeworth's, aren't you, Ema? Ema: We're good friends and all, Mr. Wright... ...but, just this once, I intend to faithfully and fully testify for the prosecution! And I do mean that wholeheartedly! Edgeworth: Heh. I expect no less from you. Ema: Yes, sir! I'm going to do my very best! Maya: Looks like you lost the popularity contest to Mr. Edgeworth, Nick. Phoenix: ...Meh, I really could care less. Besides... ...she'll see who's the better lawyer once I win this trial. Maya: Yeah... Maybe then you'll actually really care less. Judge: Now, Detective Skye, if you please. Witness Testimony -- Rundown of the Case -- Ema: The murder weapon was a clock called the \"Time Keeper.\" The victim was hit with it from behind, and he fell over, right into the lantern. The defendant was spotted then, standing in front of the body holding the murder weapon. The victim was struck twice, by the way. Phoenix: He was struck twice? Ema: That's right. There's no mistake about it. The first blow was to the back of the victim's head. It was hard enough to knock him unconscious. Yet, despite the fact that he had been immobilized by the first blow... ...the defendant delivered a second, fatal blow to the side of the victim's head. Phoenix: ...Which means... what, exactly? Edgeworth: Hmph. I figured it would go right over your head. Let's put it this way: By striking the victim a second time... ...the defendant killed her last chance to escape from any criminal wrongdoing. Judge: She did? But how, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: The defendant may have been fighting back because she was being attacked. However... ...she then went on to deliver a fatal blow to a man who was already fully unconscious. Maya: N-Nick, is he saying what I think he is...? Phoenix: I don't feel so well... Edgeworth: And thus, Mr. Wright, has justified self-defense been removed from the table. The prosecution intends to prove that the defendant killed the victim... ...with murderous intent. Allow me to, belatedly, submit the victim's autopsy report. Phoenix: ......A... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRNNGH! (So THAT'S why he was acting all smug...! Well, more smug than usual...) Maya: I-It's fine, right? It's not like we were going to plead self-defense anyway, right? Phoenix: Right, but... now the judge has a negative impression of Ellen. Judge: ............ Edgeworth: Hmph. Phoenix: (He may not get to prosecute much anymore, but he definitely hasn't lost his touch.) Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Judge: Now, then, Mr. Wright. You may begin your cross-examination. Cross Examination -- Rundown of the Case -- Ema: The murder weapon was a clock called the \"Time Keeper.\" Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you completely sure the murder weapon was the Time Keeper? Ema: Yes, completely. The shape of the injury on the victim's head matches up with that of the Time Keeper. And it's definitely heavy enough to kill someone with. Phoenix: But would the defendant have been able to pick up and swing something so heavy? Ema: I tried it myself, and I was able to lift it up just fine. Phoenix: Maybe you're just freakishly strong...? Ema: Excuse me, Mr. Wright?! I'll have you know that people on the force know me as the dainty forensic investigator! Phoenix: S-Sorry... (...But really, you're hardly a delicate flower.) Edgeworth: ...Mr. Wright. This is a court of law. Save your antics for after the trial, if you know how. Phoenix: Yes, sir... It won't happen again, sir... Ema: Hmph! ...Moving on! Ema: The victim was hit with it from behind, and he fell over, right into the lantern. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The defendant was fighting back against the victim, right? If so, wouldn't she have hit him from the front and not from behind? Ema: The victim must've tried to run once Ms. Wyatt started fighting back. That's probably when he got hit from behind. Phoenix: I see... Thus, the blow to the back of his head. Ema: The defendant must've looked awfully scary when she was brandishing that clock. Phoenix: I don't know about that... (Regardless of how scary Ellen looked, the victim was definitely hit from behind...) Ema: ...May I go on? Phoenix: Yes, of course. Please do. Present Photo of Victim Phoenix: Leads to: \"Detective Skye, I'm afraid I have to apologize in advance.\" Ema: The defendant was spotted then, standing in front of the body holding the murder weapon. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: B-But that's only because she was so panicked when she found the body... ...that she tried to use the Time Keeper to go back in time. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Mr. Wright... Do you have any idea how absurd you sound? Phoenix: B-But Ms. Wyatt really believed she could travel through time with that clock! Edgeworth: You really should've come up with a more credible story, you know. Judge: Yes, I agree. Phoenix: (Me, three... But it's all I have to go on...) Ema: ...Anyway, under the circumstances... ...the only conclusion we can draw is that the defendant killed the victim. Ema: The victim was struck twice, by the way. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Ms. Wyatt must've had a chance to escape after she struck the victim the first time. So why would she stick around and hit him with such a heavy object again? Ema: Well, about that... Edgeworth: Allow me to explain. Why did she strike him again, indeed? To finish off the victim, of course. This very act clearly shows that she had every intention of killing Mr. Gloomsbury! Phoenix: Urk! Maya: But Ms. Wyatt would never do a thing like that! Edgeworth: Then let's see some evidence that disproves my theory! Maya: Nnrrgh...! Are you going to just stand there and take that from him, Nick?! Phoenix: (I can't refute his claim head-on, so I'll have to approach it from a different angle.) Phoenix: Well... ...it looks like we won't be going anywhere until we can refute Edgeworth's claim. Maya: This is so exciting! We haven't taken on Mr. Edgeworth in ages! Phoenix: Y-Yeah... Maya: Okay, Nick! Now, go get him! Phoenix: No need to rush me, Maya... (All right. I'd better start by comparing Ema's testimony with the evidence we have... ...and look for any glaring inconsistencies!) Phoenix: Detective Skye, I'm afraid I have to apologize in advance. Ema: For what? Phoenix: For embarrassing you in front of your idol. Ema: Wh-What do you mean? Phoenix: If you take a look at this photo of the crime scene... ...you'll see that the victim is lying on his back. But if the victim had been hit from behind as you claim... ...then he should have fallen over into the lantern facedown. Ema: Aaaaah! Phoenix: It's not enough to simply take someone's side, Detective Skye. Even if it's Mr. Edgeworth's. Ema: Ah...! Oooh... Judge: Hmm... There does appear to be a flaw in Detective Skye's testimony. Ema: Ema: Mr. Wright! If you think I'm going to just back right down, then you're sadly mistaken! Phoenix: (Ema is unusually fired up today...) Maya: Don't forget, she's in front of her hero, Nick. If the Steel Samurai came to watch this trial, I'd want to do my absolute best, too. Ema: Listen, Mr. Wright. It's entirely possible that the defendant moved the victim's body after he fell over. In that case, there wouldn't be any contradiction, right? Edgeworth: Indeed. That was an excellent counterargument, Detective. Ema: You can count on me, sir! So, what do you have to say to that, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Is it possible that the victim's body was moved after he fell into the lantern? It's possible Phoenix: The defense believes... it's possible that the victim's body was moved by the defendant! Maya: Wh-What are you doing, Nick?! You're backing up Ema's claim?! Phoenix: ......Oops! I meant to answer in the negative! Judge: In other words, you wish to claim the exact opposite of what you just said? A reversal that dramatic... ...deserves an equally dramatic punishment. Phoenix: There's no need to be such a drama queen about it, Your Honor... (Well, I guess this leaves me with just one answer. I can't mess this up now!) Leads back to: \"Is it possible that the victim's body was moved after he fell into the lantern?\" It's not possible Leads to: \"Sorry, Detective, but there's no way the victim's body was moved after his death.\" Phoenix: Sorry, Detective, but there's no way the victim's body was moved after his death. Ema: Oh, really? And what makes you so sure? Phoenix: One look at this here, and it should become obvious. Present rubble on top of body Phoenix: Leads to: \"Th-Those broken bits of the lantern?\" Present anywhere else Phoenix: Ema: Um... What exactly are you pointing at, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Oh... uh... This right here? Judge: Hmm... What you're trying to communicate is not obvious at all, Mr. Wright. But this penalty should make my feelings on the matter pretty obvious -- even to you. Phoenix: (The only thing that's obvious right now is the pain in my attorney's badge.) Leads back to: \"One look at this here, and it should become obvious.\" Ema: Th-Those broken bits of the lantern? Phoenix: Yes. If the body had been moved after the fact, these fragments would've fallen off of it. But, as you can clearly see, they're lying perfectly undisturbed on top of the body. This means that the victim must've been lying face up from before the lantern even broke. Ema: .......You're right! Maya: But wait a minute. If that's true... ...then when was the victim killed? I mean, the lantern was still whole during the reception, right? Phoenix: Right. Which means we've just overturned a major assumption about this case. If the victim was already dead before the lantern was even broken... ...then the body must've been inside the lantern since before the reception started. In other words... ...the defense asserts that the victim was killed before the wedding reception! Judge: WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Phoenix: In short... ...when Ms. Wyatt was seen standing in front of the body after the reception... ...it wasn't the moment just after the murder was committed. It was the moment she happened to discover the body -- just as Ms. Wyatt claims! Ema: AAAAAAAAAAH! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hmph. Whether the act was committed before or after the reception is entirely inconsequential. After all, it was the defendant who prepared the reception hall for the event in question. Therefore, when the murder occurred changes nothing with regard to her guilt. She could have killed the victim before the reception, as you claim... ...and then tried to hide his body in the lantern after the event ended! Phoenix: Phoenix: Sorry, but that doesn't make any sense. I mean, where would the body have been hidden during the reception in your scenario? Edgeworth: Urngh... Th-That's...! Phoenix: Even you have to admit, Mr. Edgeworth, that this has opened up a new possibility. Edgeworth: Do explain, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Well, if Ms. Wyatt didn't commit the crime in the reception hall... ...then that means someone, somewhere put the victim's body into the lantern. Judge: Hmm... I suppose that makes sense. A dead body couldn't have put itself in there. Phoenix: Exactly, Your Honor. In other words... If the murder actually occurred before the reception, it opens up the possibility that... He was killed somewhere else Leads to: \"If the body was hidden inside the lantern...\" The defendant didn't do it Phoenix: The defendant didn't commit this murder! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Oh, for heaven's sake. Even if the murder was committed before the reception... ...that alone doesn't erase the suspicion against the defendant! Judge: It seems that was too ridiculous of a leap backwards for Mr. Edgeworth, Mr. Wright. I suggest you look before you leap, and think before you speak. Phoenix: (I guess I got ahead of myself on that one...) Leads back to: \"If the murder actually occurred before the reception, it opens up the possibility that...\" He was killed some other way Phoenix: The victim was killed some other way! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What does the victim's time of death have anything to do with how he was killed? I suggest you read the autopsy report again, Mr. Wright. Especially the part that states that the victim was clubbed to death with the Time Keeper! Phoenix: It was worth a try... Judge: You should know better than to just say the first shocking thing that comes to mind. Phoenix: (I've got this. I just have to stay cool and answer rationally.) Leads back to: \"If the murder actually occurred before the reception, it opens up the possibility that...\" Phoenix: If the body was hidden inside the lantern... ...then, it's possible that the body was moved along with it from somewhere else. Maya: Oh! You're right! Edgeworth: You can run that mouth of yours all you want... ...but do you have any evidence to support what's coming out of it, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Of course I do. (I think the answer lies in that piece of evidence -- and in something... ...that was left at the crime scene that will point us to where the victim was really killed!) Judge: Very well, Mr. Wright. In that case... What proves that the lantern and the body were moved from somewhere else? Present Photo of Victim Phoenix: Leads to: \"The photo of the victim again...?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This proves that the murder took place somewhere other than the reception hall! Judge: Hmm... I'm afraid I can't say that I follow. Maya: That piece of evidence won't help you make your point, Nick! Judge: Yet another pointless piece of evidence from a senseless attorney. Phoenix: (Fine, so this piece wasn't convincing enough. Then there must be something else that would be easier for the judge to understand!) Leads back to: \"What proves that the lantern and the body were moved from somewhere else?\" Ema: The photo of the victim again...? Phoenix: Yes. I'd like the court to focus on this thing, right here! Present flower petals Phoenix: Leads to: \"Flower petals, Mr. Wright?\" Present anywhere else Phoenix: Judge: Hmm... I'm afraid I don't get it at all. What exactly are we looking at here, Mr. Wright? Edgeworth: Hmph. That far-off look in his eyes suggests that his mind is equally as far-off in La-La Land. Judge: The defense will focus on the trial, if that's not too much to ask. Phoenix: (Well, that brought me back to reality fast.) Leads back to: \"I'd like the court to focus on this thing, right here!\" Ema: Flower petals, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: These petals are from a kind of flower that were not present in the reception hall. This means they must've gotten into the lantern when it was somewhere else. Edgeworth: And just where do you propose this \"somewhere else\" to be, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: I propose that this piece of evidence will tell us where the flower petals came from. Present Photo of Hold Phoenix: Leads to: \"Please take a look at the flowers in this picture of the hold.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: One look at this, and you'll see exactly where the petals came from! Judge: ............ Are you sure about that, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: I am, Your Honor! Judge: Because I'm afraid I can't see how. Phoenix: Even if you take a really good look? Judge: Unfortunately not. Phoenix: What if you... smelled the evidence? Judge: Still nothing. Phoenix: Huh. That's odd. Aha ha ha ha... Judge: This is no laughing matter, defense! I hope this will teach you to take matters seriously! Edgeworth: I suggest you refrain from embarrassing yourself any further with such stale jokes. Phoenix: I'll make sure to whip up a fresh batch for next time, then... A-All joking aside... (Even though I was actually being serious...) Leads back to: \"I propose that this piece of evidence will tell us where the flower petals came from.\" Phoenix: Please take a look at the flowers in this picture of the hold. Notice how their petals are of the same shape as the petals in the crime scene photo? Judge: Hmm, yes. I see. They do look to be from the same kind of flower. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hmph. Is that really all you've got? A flower is a flower is a flower. They're all the same. I would hardly call what you presented \"compelling evidence.\" Judge: I'm afraid I couldn't disagree with you more, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Hm? Judge: I gave a flower of this type to my lovely wife once when we were young. So I can assure you that this is very meaningful and compelling evidence indeed. The soundness of my judgment in this matter is backed by nothing less than pure love! Edgeworth: B-But, Your Honor... Phoenix: Let it go, Mr. Edgeworth. It's clear you don't know much about flowers. It's not like you have anyone you'd actually give any to, after all. But maybe you should study up on them, just in case the opportunity presents itself. Edgeworth: Nngoooh! This is from the man who only knows the names of three types of flowers! Phoenix: Th-That's hardly relevant to the case at hand! The defense asserts that it's highly probable that the victim was killed in the hold! If the body was then placed in the lantern and moved to the reception hall for some reason... ...it would completely destroy the prosecution's case! Maya: Then you mean, the body was...? Phoenix: Yes. The victim's body was... ...inside the lantern during the entire beautiful wedding reception! While the defendant and her betrothed were celebrating their love! Judge: WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hmph. Your smooth talk might work on His Honor, but it won't work on me. Phoenix: What are you talking about now? Edgeworth: Take another look at all of the evidence and you'll soon see what I mean. Phoenix: ............ (I wish he would just tell me already...) Edgeworth: Detective Skye, I'm sure you've already figured out what I'm talking about, correct? Ema: Heh heh heh. Of course, sir! Mr. Wright is the only one here who hasn't. Why don't you leave this to me, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Very well. Let's see what you can do. Judge: Detective Skye, please give your testimony to this court. Witness Testimony -- The Prosecution's Rebuttal -- Ema: The victim could not have been killed before the reception. The autopsy report states that the estimated time of death was after the reception. And that estimated time of death is correct. There's no way it could be wrong. Ema: It's clear Mr. Gloomsbury was killed after the reception. And that completely contradicts your claim! Phoenix: Hmm......... I guess so. Edgeworth: Tell me you took at least a cursory glance at the autopsy report, Mr. Wright. It appears you've grown rusty since our last outing. Might I suggest you go back and brush up on the basics? Phoenix: ......Sure. Though I must say, you're as cocky as ever, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: I beg your pardon? Ema: Wh-What are you trying to say, Mr. Wright?! Phoenix: I'm just saying that I'll go back to basics, if that's what Mr. Edgeworth wants. I'll prove how badly he's underestimating me with a good old-fashioned cross-examination. Edgeworth: ............... Judge: Very well. Let's see you put your money where your mouth is, Mr. Wright. Cross Examination -- The Prosecution's Rebuttal -- Ema: The victim could not have been killed before the reception. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You sound pretty certain. You must have some solid grounds for making that claim, right? Ema: Of course I do. And you're gonna feel silly when I show you what they are. Ready? Feast your eyes on this! Ema: The autopsy report states that the estimated time of death was after the reception. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: I've read the autopsy report, too, you know. Ema: Then you don't need me to explain it to you, right? How there's no way the victim could've been killed before the reception, I mean. Phoenix: Detective Skye... ...I think you've overlooked something big. Ema: I have?! Phoenix: Why don't you take another look at the evidence? Ema: ...But I've already looked at all the evidence! And quite carefully, too, I'll have you know! Edgeworth: Detective Skye. Do not be taken in by his verbal antics. He is simply bluffing, as always. Ema: R-Right, sir! Ema: And that estimated time of death is correct. There's no way it could be wrong. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Is it possible that the culprit did something to obscure the real time of death? Ema: No, not in this case. There was no snow or anything to keep the body from decomposing. And there's no fridge on that airship big enough to fit a body into. Phoenix: So you've already checked into that, I see... Maya: It all comes down to the estimated time of death, doesn't it? Couldn't the killer mess with the victim's time of death by keeping the body on ice? Phoenix: Yeah, if they had the means to. Present Fog Machine Phoenix: Leads to: \"I admit that the estimated time of death does contradict my theory.\" Phoenix: The prosecution is treating the estimated time of death as an absolute. But is it really? Maya: I take it you don't think it is, huh, Nick? In that case, we're going to have to find a way to convince them otherwise! Phoenix: Yeah, there's gotta be a way somehow... Phoenix: I admit that the estimated time of death does contradict my theory. Ema: Finally! And that means your theory that the victim was killed before the reception... Phoenix: ...Is still entirely plausible! Ema: Huh? Wh-What makes you think that? Phoenix: The killer could've falsified the time of death by using a certain item in the reception hall. Please take a look at this. Judge: And what is that contraption, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: It's a fog machine, Your Honor, used to create a special, romantic atmosphere in the hall. Judge: And this machine could have been used to falsify the time of death? Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor, because this machine uses dry ice to perform its magic. Judge: Dry ice? Ah yes -- the super cold stuff commonly used to make theatrical fog, right? I see. So your claim is that this dry ice was used to keep the body cold? Ema: ......Oh...! In that case, I guess the victim COULD have been killed before the reception... Judge: Order! Order in this court! Well, Mr. Edgeworth? What do you have to say about this development? Edgeworth: ......That the victim was killed in the hold before the wedding reception? .....The prosecution acknowledges the possibility of this claim. Phoenix: (Now we're getting somewhere!) Edgeworth: ...The prosecution would also like to thank you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Huh? For what? Edgeworth: I didn't know how a certain piece of evidence fit into this case... But now, thanks to you, I do. Phoenix: What piece of evidence? Edgeworth: To get into the hold, one needs a key card, like this one. And, here, we have a record of those who entered the hold with such key cards. The times aren't specified, but these are the last three entries on the day of the murder. And as you can see, the last person to enter the hold that day... was the defendant. Phoenix: Wh-What?! Judge: So the one who moved the body out of the hold must have been...? Edgeworth: That's right. It was none other than the defendant. Hold Entry Record added to the Court Record. Maya: Hey, Nick, take a look at this entry record. There are a couple of other names on here besides Ellen's. Phoenix: Hey, you're right! According to the entry record, Mr. Edgeworth, Pierce Nichody had also gone into the hold. Isn't it possible that he could've been the culprit? Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Sorry, but Mr. Nichody was escorting a few of the guests at the time. I'm sure they would be happy to testify to that fact, if you'd like. Think me cocky all you'd like, Mr. Wright, but my confidence is rarely misplaced. Phoenix: Arngh... Edgeworth: Now then, it's probably safe to assume that after killing the victim in the hold... ...the defendant moved his body to the hall in order to dispose of it discreetly. Phoenix: What do you mean by \"discreetly\"? Edgeworth: The defendant volunteered to take care of the reception's cleanup personally. That means she would've had the chance to dispose of anything in any way she wanted. Including taking the lantern off the airship without raising any suspicion. Don't tell me you didn't know about Ms. Wyatt volunteering for cleanup duty, Mr. Wright. Ellen: For my last task as a servant of the Sprocket household... ...I offered to take on the preparation and cleanup of the reception banquet. Phoenix: I-I see... Phoenix: Gaaah! Edgeworth: Look at you, sweating buckets like a rookie... even after all these years. Nevertheless... Thank you for proving that the only person who could've killed the victim in the hold is... ...Ellen Wyatt! Phoenix: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! (Great job, Phoenix. Now we're back to square one!) Edgeworth: Heh. Perhaps you should ask Ms. Cykes for some help in reviewing Defense for Dummies. Ema: Way to go, sir! You've got Mr. Wright in a cold sweat! Edgeworth: Hmph. I wonder if maybe the promise of seeing that miserable look on his face... ...is what brought me back to court today. It's certainly made all of my stress and woes as chief prosecutor just melt away. Maya: I guess he had a lot of stress built up. Phoenix: I'll give him something to stress over before we're through today! Edgeworth: Your Honor, the prosecution asks that you render your verdict at this time. Before that man over there tries to throw the court into chaos with his meaningless bluffs. Judge: ...Hmm, I see. Mr. Wright... ...are there any last meaningful bluffs you'd like to present to this court? Phoenix: Uh... (Why does he have to assume it'll be a bluff?) Maya: N-Nick! Hurry up and throw a good one out there! Phoenix: I will! I will! ........... Well, all right, then. Let's see... I-I've got it! How do you know it was Ms. Wyatt who used her key card? After all, if it turns out that somebody else used her card... ...it would mean Ms. Wyatt didn't do it! Judge: Interesting. And are you able to prove this bluff to be true? Phoenix: I-I assure you, I'm not bluffing, Your Honor. (Well, now what...?) Maya: Wait a minute, Nick. I can think of a certain somebody who might've used Ellen's key card. Phoenix: You can? Maya: Remember? The one who was sneaking around the hold, in spite of not being a family member...? Phoenix: Oh, that's right! Your Honor! The defense would like to call a certain witness to the stand! I need the testimony of this person, who may have entered the hold with Ms. Wyatt's card! Present Larry Butz profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Th-That's your witness?!\" Present anyone else Phoenix: Phoenix: This person used Ms. Wyatt's key card to enter the hold! Edgeworth: What are you talking about, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Wait, did I make a mistake...? Edgeworth: You would know if you had been paying any attention to our arguments up to this point. Phoenix: ...Ahem. So... So that means... Judge: Exactly. It means you get a penalty. Phoenix: I was afraid of that. Edgeworth: I'd advise you to take this a little more seriously, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: And I will! Your Honor! The defense would like to call a certain witness to the stand! Leads back to: \"I need the testimony of this person, who may have entered the hold with Ms. Wyatt's card!\" Edgeworth: Th-That's your witness?! A-Are you saying that THAT numbskull was on the airship? He never breathed a word about that to me! Phoenix: That's not surprising, because Mr. Nichody told him to keep quiet about it. But Mr. Butz himself admitted it to me. He claimed to have found a way to sneak into the Flying Chapel's hold to see Ms. Wyatt. This photo he took and gave to me is proof. Edgeworth: Th-Then was it he who moved the lantern with the body inside to the reception hall? Phoenix: You know as well as I that with him, anything is possible. And this is one possibility we should definitely look into. Edgeworth: .....I-I can't believe this. What in the world is HE doing mixed up in this? Phoenix: Come on, Mr. Edgeworth. Remember what we've been saying since elementary school? Edgeworth: .....\"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\" Phoenix: Exactly. Edgeworth: Gaaaaaagh! That Larry! He'll pay for this! Phoenix: Well, if you want to extract your payment now... ...he's right up there in the gallery! Larry: Yikes! Judge: Bailiff! Seize the witness before he makes a run for it! Larry: Noooooooooooooooooo! Why does this stuff always happen to MEEEEEEEEEE?! Phoenix: (Sorry, Larry... but you brought this on yourself.) Judge: Let us break for a fifteen minute recess. I ask that both sides prepare for the next witness's testimony during this time. September 22District Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Maya: Wow. It's been a while since I've had this much fun and excitement! A face-off against Mr. Edgeworth! A harrowing tightrope walk for the defense! Phoenix: Whew! I'm exhausted already. ???: Boss! Athena: I'm here for moral support! Phoenix: Athena! Are you all done practicing for Trucy's magic show? Athena: Well... to be perfectly honest... I sorta ran away. But that's because she was putting my life in danger, I tell you! Phoenix: I see... I think I'll need to have a one-on-one with her... You're really athletic and fit, Athena, so Trucy probably thinks she can run you ragged. Athena: That may be true... ...which is why not even Trucy can keep up with me when I run at full speed! ???: Hah! Looks like you spoke too soon, Athena! Never underestimate the resourcefulness of a great magician! Athena: Huh? Trucy: Magical Girl Trucy Wright... is on the scene! Athena: N-Nooooooooooooooooooo! Trucy: Now, Athena! It's time to practice human combustion magic! Go on, douse yourself in this gasoline! But don't worry! It's a magic trick, after all, so it's perfectly safe! Athena: ......R... R... Run awaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!!! Trucy: Hey, you! You're not getting off that easily! Maya: Ha ha ha! They get along so well, don't they? It reminds me of the good ol' days. You, me and Pearly... Oh, and Detective Gumshoe! Can't forget him. We had all kinds of fun at the crime scenes back then, remember? Phoenix: ...Leaving me to do all the serious investigating as I recall. Bailiff: Court will soon be back in session, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Right, thank you! Maya: So Larry's the next witness, right? I can't wait to see what happens! Phoenix: Sadly, I can already imagine it... September 22District Court - Courtroom No. 6 Judge: Court will now reconvene. Larry: ......Nick! Edgey! The two of you are gonna hang me out to dry, aren't you?! Edgeworth: No, not the both of us. Just Mr. Wright. Larry: N-Nick... How could you...? Phoenix: (I don't really think he did it, of course, but I've gotta use whatever leads I can...) Mr. Butz, there's a possibility you moved the lantern that had the dead body in it. So if you want to clear yourself of any suspicion, all you have to do is testify. Larry: ............ Judge: Now then, your testimony, please, witness.

Phoenix: Larry, just tell us the truth already. Did you or didn't you go into the hold and move a lantern up to the reception hall? Larry: I... I never moved any bull lantern, I tell ya! Phoenix: \"Bull lantern\"? Larry: Wh-What? Did I say something weird? Phoenix: You told me that you didn't attend the wedding reception. Larry: Can you believe they told me only family and relatives could attend?! They wouldn't even let me into the reception hall! Larry: Uh, y-yeah. So what? Phoenix: Then, that's odd... No one in this courtroom ever mentioned the sex of the lantern that was moved. So how could you know that it was a \"bull\" lantern? Larry: Y-You didn't have to actually go to the reception to know that! Anyone could tell there were two Pegabulls by looking at the Flying Chapel's pamphlet! Phoenix: (All I can tell right now is that there's a strong scent of bull in the air in here.) Please add that last statement to your testimony, Mr. Butz.

I hope all of this leads somewhere...) Phoenix: I want you to take a look at this, Mr. Butz. Because unfortunately for you, the pamphlet clearly shows... ...a Pegacow and a Pegabull in their example diagram of the reception hall. Larry: Huh?! Phoenix: But on that day, instead of putting a Pegacow and Pegabull out for the bride and groom... ...there were two male Pegabulls on display. Larry: Nnnnngh... Phoenix: Yet, somehow, you knew there were two Pegabulls in the reception hall that day. There's only one way you'd know something like that, Larry... It was YOU who moved the Pegabull to the reception hall, wasn't it?! Larry: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Edgeworth: N-No... Larry, y-you didn't...! Judge: Mr. Butz, did you move the lantern containing the victim's body to the reception hall? Larry: Th-That's what it looks like! Maya: Whaaaaat?! Phoenix: ............! Larry: Larry: W-Wait! Nick! Y-You don't think I'M the murderer, do ya?! Maya: Maybe you and Mr. Gloomsbury were fighting over Ms. Wyatt, and you ended up killing him? Larry: M-Mayaaaaa! Not you, tooooo! Look, I did sneak into the reception, but that's as far as it went. You know me! I wouldn't hurt a fly! Phoenix: Y-You \"snuck into the reception\"...? Larry: Yeah, sure. But some of the Sprocket men caught and locked me up in one of the cabins. It was pretty awful, actually! But that's when I made that drawing of the pterodactyl I showed you, Nick! Phoenix: (Ix-nay on the erodactyl-ptay, Larry...) Edgeworth: Mr. Wright, not even you would take this farce that far... would you? Phoenix: ............ (We ARE talking about Larry... What do I do? Do I accuse Larry of being the true culprit?) Accuse him Phoenix: (I guess I have no choice but to accuse him...! Wait a minute... But Larry didn't have any reason to kill Gloomsbury!) Leads to: \"No, you're right, Mr. Edgeworth.\" No, of course not Leads to: \"No, you're right, Mr. Edgeworth.\" Phoenix: No, you're right, Mr. Edgeworth. Mr. Butz didn't have a reason to kill Mr. Gloomsbury. He might've had an imaginary reason to kill Sorin Sprocket, sure, but not Mr. Gloomsbury. Maya: After all, he did steal Mr. Sprocket's bride and try to elope with her... Larry: Just 'cause I tried to steal somebody's bride doesn't make me a murderer! Phoenix: ......I believe you, Larry. And I don't think you killed anybody, either. You would never do anything like that. Larry: N-Nick, ol' buddy, ol' pal! I knew you'd come through for me! Phoenix: (Funny, that, considering your sworn testimony just now that we were through...) Judge: Mr. Butz, it's time you told this court the whole truth. Understood? Witness Testimony -- Moving the Lantern -- Larry: It's just like Nick said, I'm the one who moved the lantern. I was poking around the reception hall before the main event and saw a lantern was broken. There was a note on it that said, \"Exchange with the one in the hold. --Ellen.\" So I decided to do Elly a favor. Judge: So you switched the lanterns before the reception, did you? Then that means the victim really WAS killed before the reception. Broken Lantern updated in the Court Record. Edgeworth: It would appear... that Mr. Butz completely fell for the defendant's scheme. Larry: Scheme? What scheme? Edgeworth: This note from the defendant: \"Exchange with the one in the hold. --Ellen\"... Mr. Butz moved the lantern with the body in it up to the reception hall because of this note. And thus, he has become a suspect in Mr. Gloomsbury's murder. Larry: *gulp*... That second lantern did feel pretty heavy... ...but I never would've thought there was a dead body in it! Phoenix: (Arnngh... What was a note like that doing on a lantern in the first place...?!) Ellen: Ellen: You've got it all wrong, Mr. Edgeworth! I left that note for myself! It was simply a reminder because I can be very forgetful! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What a sorry excuse, Ms. Wyatt. The prosecution contends that this note shows one facet of the defendant's murderous plan. And you, Mr. Butz, you played right into Ms. Wyatt's hands. Larry: No way, Edgey! I don't believe it! Phoenix: Phoenix: Do you still really believe Ms. Wyatt to be the culprit, Mr. Edgeworth? Edgeworth: Hmph. Of course. My stance on the matter remains unchanged. If you think I'm wrong, then prove it with your cross-examination. Phoenix: (Gladly!) Judge: Very well. Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness. Cross Examination -- Moving the Lantern -- Larry: It's just like Nick said, I'm the one who moved the lantern. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why didn't you tell us that sooner?! Larry: Because I knew you guys were gonna be suspicious of me, that's why! Phoenix: We're suspicious of you now because you tried to hide it! Edgeworth: My thoughts exactly. Larry: Hmph! Well, now I've told you! Happy? So how about letting me go?! Phoenix: No, not yet. We need you to stick around to sort a few things out. Larry: Grrrrr! FINE! Larry: I was poking around the reception hall before the main event and saw a lantern was broken. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The lantern you swapped out was a female Pegamoo -- a Pegacow, right? Larry: Yeah, I guess. Phoenix: Why did you replace a female lantern with a male one? Larry: Because I was too busy trying not to get caught. I didn't have time to check for little details like that. Phoenix: If you didn't want to get caught, you could've just left well enough alone, you know. Larry: Whatever! Anyway, when I took a look at the broken lantern, I saw... Larry: There was a note on it that said, \"Exchange with the one in the hold. --Ellen.\" Press Phoenix: Phoenix: That note wasn't addressed to you, was it? Larry: Well, I guess not, but... ...how could I let my dear, sweet Elly do all that hard physical labor on her own?! Phoenix: (It's precisely that thought process that constantly gets you in trouble, Larry...) Larry: Besides, it was my big chance to show her how much I cared about her. Larry: So I decided to do Elly a favor. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Nobody saw you the whole time while you were switching the lanterns? Larry: Nope. I didn't get caught. Not that time, anyway. Phoenix: \"Not that time\"? Larry: Yeah. When I'd tried to sneak into the reception hall the first time... ...I didn't have as much luck. Those Sprocket guys spotted me and nabbed me. Phoenix: All of my words are failing me right now... Larry: Pretty exciting, don't ya think? Phoenix: (Larry... You need help.) Larry: And then they locked me up in one of the cabins. ......Nick, what are you asking about stuff like this for, anyway? Shouldn't you be trying to prove Elly's innocence?! Phoenix: (Well... Is that statement of his important to the case...?) It's important Phoenix: Mr. Butz trying to crash the reception, and subsequently getting locked up in a cabin... I believe these might be important facts in this case, Your Honor. Judge: Very well. Mr. Butz, please add that statement to your testimony. Adds statement \"I tried to sneak into the reception hall, but I got caught and locked up in a cabin.\" It's not important Phoenix: Given the lack of any important info... I guess I can let this line of questioning go for now. Leads back to cross-examination Press (after adding statement) Phoenix: Phoenix: Nobody saw you the whole time while you were switching the lanterns? Larry: Nope. I didn't get caught. Not that time, anyway. Phoenix: \"Not that time\"? Larry: Yeah. When I'd tried to sneak into the reception hall the first time... ...I didn't have as much luck. Those Sprocket guys spotted me and nabbed me. Phoenix: All of my words are failing me right now... Larry: Pretty exciting, don't ya think? Phoenix: (Larry... You need help.) Larry: And then they locked me up in one of the cabins. ......Nick, what are you asking about stuff like this for, anyway? Shouldn't you be trying to prove Elly's innocence?! Larry: I tried to sneak into the reception hall, but I got caught and locked up in a cabin. Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you got locked up. Then what happened? Larry: I broke out. Then I started looking for Elly and wandered into the reception hall again. That's when I saw the broken lantern and replaced it. Phoenix: ......Even after they caught you and locked you up, you still went looking for Ms. Wyatt? ...But, hold on a minute... Maya: What is it, Nick? Phoenix: Maya, doesn't something seem weird to you? Larry is saying he replaced the lantern after he broke out of the cabin. Maya: That's right-- Oh, wait... Huh? You're right. It doesn't make much sense, does it? Judge: Mr. Wright, have you found an inconsistency in the witness's statement? Phoenix: Yes, I believe so, Your Honor. Mr. Butz moved the lantern after he broke out of the cabin, but that contradicts with this. Present Broken Lantern Phoenix: Leads to: \"Is that...?!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Judge: Hmm... And in what sense does that piece of evidence contradict with the statement? Larry: It doesn't contradict at all, does it! Edgeworth: Indeed. Phoenix: Urngh...! Oh, don't mind me, Your Honor. It looks like I just made a tiny mistake. That's all. Leads back to cross-examination Phoenix: Knowing Larry... ...he definitely did something stupid somewhere along the way. Maya: Wow. Larry sure is one special guy... Not everyone has the privilege of being THIS distrusted by their best friends... Phoenix: Assuming he can't be trusted from the get-go usually makes things easier, I've learned. Maya: Oh, I see! You totally trust him to be totally untrustworthy! Phoenix: Yeah, I guess that just about sums it up. Judge: Is that...?! Phoenix: Yes, it's the broken lantern, Your Honor. Mr. Butz, what you're saying doesn't make any sense at all. Larry: WHAT?! Why not?! Phoenix: You swapped the lanterns before the reception began, right? Larry: Yeah. That's what I said, isn't it? Phoenix: But you also just said that you swapped the lanterns... ...after you got locked up in a cabin for trying to sneak into the reception. In other words, you're saying you swapped the lanterns both before the reception... ...and after the reception took place. Judge: Hmm... That certainly doesn't make any sense, does it? Mr. Butz, did you swap the lanterns before or after the reception? Larry: Umm... Edgeworth: Which was it: before or after?! There's a world of difference between the two! Phoenix: Well, Mr. Butz? Larry: ......I guess I can't expect guys like you to understand. In a nutshell, it was both before... and after the reception. Phoenix: What? Larry: I tried to sneak into the first reception and got locked up. Phoenix: The \"first\" reception? (Uh-oh. I don't like where this is going...) Larry: Then, through the power of Elly's pendant... ...time got rewound, and we went back to the time before the reception. It was after that when I replaced the lantern. So it was both before the reception and after the reception. Get it? Phoenix: ............ Larry: We went back in time to before the reception. So, of course, the reception would take place one more time after that, right? That's why what I said makes perfect sense! Edgeworth: ......Mr. Wright, what in the world is the witness talking about? Has he developed some sort of intellectual ailment I'm not aware of since I saw him last? Phoenix: ...Um, well... Larry: None of the Sprockets seem to remember the time skip, but I do. And Elly remembers it, too! I think the power of our love for each other made that miracle happen! Judge: Mr. Wright. I'm sorry, but... ...could you please translate this man's gibberish so the rest of us can understand? Phoenix: (So now I have to be the one to explain about the whole time travel thing?!) Larry: Go on, Nick. I know you can do it! Maya: Looks like you don't have much choice, Nick! Phoenix: (To heck with it! I can't lose any more of my dignity today anyway!) ............ The defendant, Ms. Ellen Wyatt, has told the defense the following strange story. She said that after the reception ended, she was attacked by Mr. Gloomsbury. She claims that, as she was being assaulted, she made a wish upon her pendant. \"Please, take me back... back to that blissful moment...!\" In doing so... ...time apparently rewound itself to just before the reception began! Edgeworth: ......It what? Phoenix: I know it's hard to believe, but think about it this way. Through the power of the pendant, both Ellen Wyatt and Larry Butz... ...experienced time travel! Judge: Wh-Wh-Wh.... WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: What absolute rubbish! Mr. Wright! I've heard my fair share of your nonsense over the years... ...but this takes the cake! Have you thoroughly lost your mind?! Phoenix: Phoenix: But this is simply the conclusion I came to... ...using that logic ability you love so much. Edgeworth: Wh-What? Phoenix: The truth of the matter is, the future president of Sprocket Aviation, Sorin Sprocket... ...has been researching time machines. So, what if a time machine has already been successfully created? And what if that's one of Sprocket Aviation's top secret inventions? Judge: A-A time machine?! Larry: Yeah! I even saw something while we were time traveling! I saw a pterodactyl flying through the sky! Maybe the airship was set to travel through time for their honeymoon trip? Judge: WHAAAAAAAAAT?! A-A pterodactyl?! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Y-You can't possibly have any evidence to back up your ridiculous time travel story...! Phoenix: Well... I, uh... Edgeworth: Hmph. As I thought. In any case, I now have the evidence to prove... ...that you're no more intelligent than Larry! Larry: Larry: Not so fast now, Edgey. I'm not the same ol' Larry you used to know. Edgeworth: .........Oh? Larry: You want evidence? I've got your evidence right here! This is a photo I secretly took of the first reception! Edgeworth: WHAT?! Phoenix: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! L-Larry! I can't believe you--! ......Well, anyway, good job! If we compare the photos of the first and second receptions and can find a difference... ...then we'll be able to prove that the reception was held twice! Judge: But do you really think such a difference exists? Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. I just need some time to find it for you. Edgeworth: This is preposterous! Judge: Very well. Please show the court what's different, then. Phoenix: This is proof positive that the wedding reception was held twice. Present Ellen Wyatt's bouquet Phoenix: Leads to: \"Please direct your attention to Ms. Wyatt's bouquet of flowers!\" Present anywhere else Phoenix: Phoenix: Here it is! This is proof that the reception was held twice! Judge: ...Where? Phoenix: Right here, Your Honor! Judge: ........... ......Right where? Phoenix: Um... Right... not here, maybe? Judge: It appears you've missed the mark, defense. I hope you take better aim next time before you fire off that mouth of yours! Phoenix: (But my aim is usually impeccable! I'd better take another good look at the two photos before I answer again, though!) Leads back to: \"This is proof positive that the wedding reception was held twice.\" Phoenix: Please direct your attention to Ms. Wyatt's bouquet of flowers! In the photo one of her in-laws took, the defendant is holding a yellow bouquet. But in the photo Mr. Butz took, she is holding a red bouquet! Maya: Y-You're right! Edgeworth: ......That's... impossible! Judge: Wh-What does this mean? Phoenix: It means that the defendant really did experience two wedding receptions! And she did that... when she traveled back through time! Judge: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Maya: N-Nick! You did it! You proved Ellen's time travel story to be true! Phoenix: Yeah... I can hardly believe it myself... (It's just as Ellen said -- the reception was held twice. This turns every assumption we've based this trial on upside down!) Edgeworth: Edgeworth: ......I refuse to accept such a ludicrous argument! It is pure fiction under the guise of pseudoscience, at best! There is simply no such thing as time travel! Phoenix: I know it's hard, but can't you suspend your disbelief for one nanosecond, Edgeworth? Maya: I bet sci-fi movies push all your buttons the wrong way, don't they, Mr. Edgeworth...? I can totally picture you yelling, \"That'd never happen!\" every five seconds at the screen. Maybe you should stay away from movie dates altogether... Edgeworth: That's neither here nor there! This is real life we're talking about! Judge: But the proof is clearly shown in the two photographs. Phoenix: That's right, Mr. Edgeworth, no matter how inexplica-- Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Fine. I'll entertain your absurd delusion... ...if only to demolish it before your very eyes! Phoenix: What? Edgeworth: ......Let's start with this, then, shall we? There is one thing your time travel theory fails to explain. And that is the memories of the other guests there. The defendant and Larry remember the reception occurring twice... ...but no member of the Sprocket family has even mentioned such a thing. Phoenix: That's because the time machine is classified technolog-- Edgeworth: Edgeworth: I'm not done, you birdbrain! Phoenix: B-Birdbrain?! Edgeworth: As I was saying, if the entire family had been sworn to secrecy... ...then why hadn't they sworn the woman who was marrying into the family to secrecy, too? Phoenix: Th-That's a good point... Edgeworth: Honestly. All it takes is a little common sense, Mr. Wright. Judge: Hmm... Even still... ...how do we know that the trip through time did not really occur? There is proof in the photos that it did. And besides, if time travel doesn't exist, well... ...I'd be a little disappointed, frankly. I was hoping to go back to the days of my youth-- Edgeworth: You mustn't allow yourself to be taken in by Mr. Wright's whimsical tales, Your Honor. I've read about it in various literature, you see... And they all say that time travel is just not logically feasible. Phoenix: Nnnnngh... Maya: Hmm... Maybe our argument was just a little too nonsensical, Nick... Phoenix: ......Well, in that case... ...why don't we put \"common sense\" to the test? Edgeworth: Excuse me? Phoenix: The wedding reception was held twice. The photos are proof of that. But it wasn't because of time travel. It's simply because the reception had actually been held twice. Isn't that the most reasonable way to interpret the situation? Judge: Hmm... Would you care to elaborate, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: (If time travel doesn't exist, then there's only one way to make sense of what happened!) Somebody must've orchestrated this strange phenomenon. And that somebody is... Everyone at the reception Leads to: \"What if all of the guests at the reception conspired together...\" Gloomsbury Phoenix: Mr. Gloomsbury! Judge: ......Hm? Edgeworth: And how exactly did a dead man orchestrate such an event? And more importantly, why? Phoenix: W-Well, it was... ...to make it look like Mr. Sprocket had been successful in his research...? Edgeworth: What are you asking me for?! Besides, none of the other people interviewed... ...thought that he had succeeded in accomplishing time travel! Phoenix: Your Honor, could we rewind time... by just a teeny bit? Judge: Sorry, but no. Phoenix: (I'd better rethink this quick, before I lose any more time, too.) Leads back to: \"Somebody must've orchestrated this strange phenomenon. And that somebody is...\" The gods Phoenix: Such a mysterious phenomenon could only have been caused by... ...the gods themselves! Judge: Hmm... I suppose the gods would be able to rewind time... ...or make the wedding reception happen twice, wouldn't they? Phoenix: Indeed they would, Your Honor! Judge: In that case, Mr. Wright... ...please bring these gods here to testify before this court. Phoenix: Um, Maya...? Do you think you could...? Maya: ...Not a chance. Judge: On behalf of the gods who can't be here today, please, have some divine punishment. Phoenix: (I knew I was reaching with that one... I guess I'd better come up with something more grounded next time...) Leads back to: \"Somebody must've orchestrated this strange phenomenon. And that somebody is...\" Phoenix: What if all of the guests at the reception conspired together... ...to hold the reception twice and keep quiet about it? Edgeworth: What? ......And for what purpose would they conspire to do such a thing? Phoenix: ......Well, uh... .................. *clap clap clap clap* ???: Ha ha ha! A brilliant deduction, defense. Nichody: I can tell that you are not a renowned lawyer for nothing. I must say, I underestimated you. Phoenix: How so, Mr. Nichody? Nichody: You have managed to name each event, precisely as they happened. You have revealed it all to the light of day. Phoenix: Th-Then, that means... Nichody: It was us. We orchestrated the whole thing. Yes, the reception was held twice. But not because of time travel, no -- we simply held it a second time. Edgeworth: WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Why?! Why would you do such a thing?! Nichody: To make it as though the murder Miss Ellen committed... never happened. Edgeworth: Nnngh! Nichody: Master Sorin figured that if Miss Ellen, who'd killed Gloomsbury after the first reception... ...experienced the reception one more time, she would think it was all a dream. It was he who ordered us to make it happen. However, only a few, myself included, knew of Miss Ellen's crime. Judge: Are you saying most of the guests attended two receptions without knowing why? Nichody: Indeed. They needed no reason... Master Sorin told them to do it, and do it they did. That is the Sprocket way. Phoenix: Then who hid the body in the lantern? Nichody: We did. But we did not anticipate the petals finding their way in, nor the actions of Mr. Butz. Edgeworth: And that's how you intended to cover the whole situation up?! Nichody: There is just one thing everyone here has wrong. The real scene of the murder was not the hold. It was the vista deck. Phoenix: What?! Th-Then Ms. Wyatt's recollection of the events must be correct! Nichody: I admit we tried to cover this incident up. But the fact that Miss Ellen killed Gloomsbury is undeniable. Judge: This is quite a turn of events! ???: ......... ......Heh heh heh. Edgeworth: And so it appears we have arrived at the truth at last. Phoenix: Now, now... Edgeworth: Please do feel free to travel back in time, Mr. Wright... ...and attempt to do this trial over again. Go on. Phoenix: Let's not get hasty, Edgeworth... Edgeworth: I bet you can't do it! Phoenix: I bet I can't, eeeeeiiiither! Edgeworth: Your Honor, we will have to hold a separate trial for the cover-up conspiracy later. But as far as this case goes... ...I believe we are ready for your ruling. Judge: Hmm... Phoenix: Phoenix: Just before the defendant lost consciousness during her attack... ...she says she saw someone strike the victim. It's possible that this third party is the true culprit! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You still want us to believe the defendant's words? Perhaps you've lost more than your touch during your time abroad. This \"third person\" nonsense is nothing but rubbish, and you know it! Phoenix: Phoenix: But, by the same token... ...how can we trust those who conspired and lied to fool this court of law? For all we know, they might still be hiding something! Edgeworth: Nrgh... You never know when to quit, do you?! Judge: Now, now. Calm down, both of you. In any case, there isn't enough trustworthy information yet for me to render a verdict. I suggest we continue the trial after both sides have investigated the matter further. Edgeworth: ......Nnnnrrrrgh. Very well, Your Honor. Phoenix: (Phew! That was close...) Judge: Mr. Nichody... As for you and your cohorts' attempt to cover up this crime... ...your case will be brought to a separate trial following the resolution of this current one. Nichody: Understood, Your Honor. Judge: Well, then... This concludes today's trial. Court is adjourned! To be continued Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor, I have a feeling this piece of evidence contradicts the witness's statement! Judge: ...A \"feeling,\" defense? Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor... Or, rather, a \"hope\" that it indicates a contradiction... Judge: Mr. Wright. Is there or isn't there a contradiction here? Phoenix: It looks like there is... but there really isn't one, is there? Judge: Are you asking me, Mr. Wright? Because what it really seems like to me is you're asking for a penalty! Phoenix: Thanks for that definitive answer, Your Honor... Edgeworth: *sigh* With a lawyer like you, Mr. Wright, even I feel bad for the defendant. Phoenix: (Well, you don't have to feel bad for her for long! I'll get it right next time, you'll see!) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: Your Honor, the witness's statement contains a glaring contradiction! And this is the piece of evidence that says it all! ............. ............... Judge: ...Will it start saying something anytime soon, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: ............ ............ ...It's not speaking up at all, is it? Maybe it's being shy? Judge: ...... Your evidence has said nothing at all to this court. But your choice of tactics speaks volumes about you, defense! Maya: Even I knew that wasn't a very smart move, Nick... Phoenix: Arrrngh... Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Phoenix: Phoenix: The witness's statement is inconsistent with this piece of evidence! Edgeworth: ...Mr. Wright. Would you care to tell this court what percent sure you are of your claim? Phoenix: Why, of course! I'm a hundre--! Well, er... ninety... Wait, maybe eighty-ish...? W-Would you accept... fifty percent? Judge: Mr. Wright! I won't have such half-hearted bluffing in my courtroom! Edgeworth: Your Honor. Might I recommend that the defense be penalized with one-hundred-percent severity? Judge: Oh, I intend to, Mr. Edgeworth! You can be sure of that! Phoenix: Nngh... (Guess I can't say I deserved zero percent of that...) Consult (when evidence must be presented) Phoenix: So, what do you think we should do now, Maya? Maya: That one statement sounds awfully fishy to me, Nick. Phoenix: ...Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. Maya: So now it's just a matter of deciding which piece of evidence to present, right? Phoenix: Yeah. I'll take another look at the evidence and compare it to that statement, then. Consult (when statements must be pressed) Phoenix: So... what now? Maya: Well, you can press the witness some more... ...and try and get new information out of them, right? Phoenix: Right. (Guess I'd better get down to pressing the witness, then.) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! I see no need to further prolong this trial. The defense's case is insufficient to overturn the prosecution's claims! This court finds the defendant, Ellen Wyatt... Guilty Turnabout Time Traveler Image Gallery Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 September 22, 1:48 PMWright Anything Agency Athena: Whaaaaaaaaaaaaat?! So the whole time traveling thing... ...was just a ruse put on by the guests at the reception? Phoenix: Looks like it. I knew there had to be some kind of trick to it. Athena: Wow. Two wedding receptions! Can you imagine? I wonder how much THAT must've cost them! Phoenix: I-I have no idea... But if you have to ask, you're not rich enough to want to know... Still, if you've got the money, it's a pretty good way to cover things up, if you ask me. Athena: You got that right...! I'm sure I would've been completely fooled. Maya: Hi! I'm back! Phoenix: Hey, Maya. Are you all set to go? Maya: Yup! Ready when you are! So! What should we start with? Phoenix: Hmm... Let's start with reviewing what we learned at the trial. What Ellen thought was time travel was really just a performance put on by the Sprockets. But other than that, it seems that what Ellen told us was actually all true. Maya: So what really matters right now is... ...the identity of the mystery person Ellen said she saw while she was being attacked! Athena: So, who IS this mystery person? Phoenix: That's the million-dollar question, I'm afraid. But if we want to clear Ellen of any suspicion, then figuring out who they are is key. Athena: I think I'll take \"Toilets\" for $200, instead, Mr. Wright... Phoenix: Well, at least there were only so many people on that airship that night. And we know who the mastermind of the whole cover-up plot was, too, so that's good. Athena: You mean the groom, Sorin Sprocket, right? Phoenix: Exactly. He might know something that could help us out. ???: So then, what am I doing here? Larry: I'm a very busy man, you know. Phoenix: Well, all of the other people involved are Sorin's family members. So I thought I'd better start by interviewing you. (Even if I probably shouldn't trust a word out of your mouth...) Larry: Oh, man... I have a really tight schedule, but... aw heck, what are friends for, right? Okay, pal! Go ahead, ask me anything! Phoenix: (Um, you DO remember it was you who came to me for help in the first place, right...?) Talk The incident Phoenix: I want to go over exactly WHAT happened WHEN before I step outside this office again. Since you were there, Larry, do you think you could help me get it all straight in my head? Larry: *sigh* If I gotta... Phoenix: Okay. So, the first reception was held at 7 PM on the day of the incident. That's the one you tried to crash, right? Larry: Huh? Oh, yeah, that's right. And then they locked me up in a cabin! It was awful, I tell you! Phoenix: (Too bad we're not here to focus on you, Larry.) And then the incident occurred after this first reception, at around 10 PM. Ellen was attacked in the reception hall by Gloomsbury. He forced her out onto the vista deck and was just about to kill her... Larry: But Elly fought back, and ended up killing ol' Gloomsbury instead. To cover it up, the family quickly threw together a second reception. That's what Edgey is claiming, anyway. But I know my Elly didn't do it! Phoenix: The key point here is the mystery person Ellen said she saw strike Gloomsbury... ...just before she passed out. Did you see anybody suspicious skulking around that day? Larry: Nope. Not a soul! Because I was locked up in a cabin at the time! Phoenix: But you managed to escape, and sneak back into the reception hall. That's when you switched the lantern in the event hall with the lantern in the hold, right? Did you see anybody then? Larry: Nope. The place was completely deserted. I guess 'cause that Pierce butler guy had everybody gathered together somewhere. Phoenix: That makes sense. He must've been going over the cover-up plan with them. (So, clearly, the murder had already happened by the time Larry got out...) They must've gotten everything ready fast, and had the second reception soon after that. Larry: Then, after that second reception, Elly went to clean up the reception hall... ...and, as luck would have it, that's when she found the body in the lantern I'd brought up. I tried to do something nice for Elly out of the goodness of my heart, and THIS happened! Phoenix: Hmm... We still don't know exactly what happened during the actual murder itself. We'll just have to look into it, along with the identity of that mystery person... The cabin (appears after \"The incident\") Leads to: \"So while the murder was taking place, you were locked up in a cabin.\" Phoenix: So while the murder was taking place, you were locked up in a cabin. Did you see anything unusual while you were in there? Larry: In the cabin? Let's see... Well... there was that pterodactyl flying through the sky! That's pretty unusual! Phoenix: Oh, right. That drawing of that \"pterodactyl\" you \"saw\"... Larry: What's with all the air quotes?! I really did see it! I swear! Phoenix: But, Larry, the time travel thing never actually happened. Which means you couldn't have seen a real pterodactyl flying through the sky! Larry: O-Oh... Are you doubting the eye of a super-popular picture book author?! Phoenix: No, I'm sure you saw something else, and mistook that for a flying reptile. Larry: Niiiiiick! You're making me doubt my own eyes! Now I'm not even sure WHAT I saw! Larry's Drawing updated in the Court Record. Phoenix: Either way, you have no idea what actually happened at the real scene of the murder? Larry: That's right! And I can say that with every confidence! Oh, wow. Would ya look at the time? I'd better go. I have a book signing to get to. Phoenix: A book signing? Whose book? Larry: Whose do you think?! It's mine, of course! It's a Laurice Deauxnim book signing! Phoenix: I bet you went around and begged a bunch of bookstores to let you do one. Larry: O-Of course not! Th-They're the ones coming around to beg ME! Phoenix: (Looks like I guessed right...) Larry: A-Anyway, I have to go! I'll send you ten copies of my new book that just got released the other day, all right?! Phoenix: T-Ten? That's very generous of you... Larry: What are you talking about? I'm gonna send you the bill, too, of course. Just put 'em down as office expenses or something. Well, see ya! Phoenix: W-Wait, Larry! We don't need... ...Argh. He's gone. Athena: I'll take a copy, Boss! Oh, and make sure it's signed! Phoenix: Oh, boy... (Trucy's not gonna like this \"office expense.\") Maya: There goes our first lead. What do you want to tackle next, Nick? Phoenix: Right, we should really hit the streets now, huh? How about we go see Ellen? Athena: Sounds good, Boss! I bet I can cheer her up! Phoenix: I thought you were going to help Trucy with her magic show again today, Athena? Weren't you supposed to go meet her right about now? Trucy said she was going to practice her new trick on you, if I recall. Athena: \"On me\"...?! Really? Phoenix: Trucy's show is an important source of income for our agency, you know. You can leave the case to us, so you go ahead and run along, now. Athena: B-But, Boss...! Phoenix: Off you go, Athena! Athena: Nooooo... I don't wanna dieeeee... Phoenix: We'd better get going, too, Maya. Maya: Okay! Talk Any ideas? Maya: ............ Phoenix: Why the long face, Maya? Maya: I can't believe time travel isn't real after all... Phoenix: I see... Maya: I thought I'd get to go back in time and see real dinosaurs and ninjas and stuff! Phoenix: Yeah... Too bad, huh? (I couldn't be more relieved, personally.) What to do Phoenix: So, what should we do? Maya: Oh, I don't know... I mean, shouldn't we just keep investigating stuff or something? Phoenix: (She's really lost that spark... ...ever since I proved that time traveling wasn't real in court today...) September 22Detention Center - Visitor's Room Ellen: Oooooh... My poor, sweet Sorin...! I wonder how he's getting along without me... Phoenix: Hello, Ellen. Ellen: Oh, Mr. Wright! What's going to happen with the trial, do you think? Phoenix: Well, first and foremost... ...we have to hurry up and find this mystery person you saw just before you passed out. Ellen: Do you think that person could be the real killer? Phoenix: It's quite possible. And if we can prove that, we can clear you of all charges. Actually, would you happen to know where Sorin is right now? Ellen: He's usually busy with meetings all afternoon, but he should be home by evening. Phoenix: I think I'd better go have a chat with him later, then. (Why am I being treated to a view of someone's underwear...?) Ellen: Mr. Wright! Don't tell me... ...you suspect my sweet Sorin?! Phoenix: Well, he is the one who masterminded the second reception after the \"time skip\"... ...so I thought he might be able to tell us something. Ellen: How COULD you, Mr. Wright?! You can't possibly think--! My Sorin would NEVER kill anyone! Phoenix: A-All right, all right! Just calm down! Ellen: NO, not if you're accusing my Sorin! Phoenix: Please! I'm not accusing anybody! So please put the pan and ladle down, all right? Ellen: Really...? Phoenix: C-Cross my heart. So, for now, would you mind if I ask you a few more things about the case? (I'd better be careful not to provoke her...) Talk Sorin Phoenix: Could you tell me about Sorin? Ellen: There's nothing to tell! He's squeaky clean! Phoenix: A-All right, okay! (Maybe I should avoid the topic of Sorin right now.) L-Let's talk about something else, then. Ellen: Fine, but you won't hear a peep out of me about Sorin! Phoenix: (Talk about pulling teeth...) Pierce Nichody (appears after \"Sorin\") Phoenix: Could you tell me about Pierce Nichody, then? Ellen: Pierce... He came to Sprocket Manor about a year ago. As the family butler, he's now in charge of everything in the household. Phoenix: Only a year ago? Did he have some kind of special connection with the family? Ellen: I'm just a maid, so I'm not privy to such things, I'm afraid. Phoenix: (It might've been Sorin's order, but Pierce is the one who coordinated the whole thing. He's the one who really orchestrated the grand \"time travel\" farce. He must have quite a bit of authority in that family...) But, no matter how good he is at his job... ...how could anybody gain that much influence in a single year? Ellen: I really don't know... I mean, he IS an excellent butler. Wouldn't that explain it? Phoenix: (Hmm... Is it really as simple as that?) Time travel (appears after \"Pierce Nichody\") Phoenix: What you thought was time travel was really just a cover-up carried out by your in-laws. Pierce said Sorin was the one who ordered the whole thing. Ellen: I still can't believe it. Even if the second reception was fake... ...Sorin would never use time travel for something like that! He's very serious about his time machine research, you know! Phoenix: I heard there's a reason he's researching time machines, actually... ...Something about \"something he wishes he could change\"... But isn't the whole idea of traveling back in time itself a little... fantastic? Ellen: I don't think so! After all, Sorin said real time travelers do exist! Phoenix: Really, now? You think he knows someone who actually traveled through time? Ellen: That's right. I haven't seen it personally, but Sorin said as much... ...so I believe it. Phoenix: (Somebody who actually traveled through time, huh? It's pretty hard to believe...) Thank you, Ellen. Ellen: You're going out to do your investigation now, aren't you? Phoenix: Yes, that's right. Ellen: Please make sure you don't cause Sorin any trouble, okay? Phoenix: I'm afraid... I can't promise you that. Ellen: Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?! Please! Whatever you do! Please don't upset my poor Sorin any further! I'm begging you! Phoenix: I-I'll do my best to not cause him any unnecessary trouble. Ellen: Ooh, I couldn't bear it if Sorin ever came under suspicion! I'd rather be found guilty myseeeeeeeelf! WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Phoenix: Yikes! Ellen, please! Don't work yourself up like this! You don't want Sorin to worry, do you? Ellen: N-No. You're right... Phoenix: (And the flood waters recede once more...) Maya: So what do we do now, Nick? Phoenix: Well, Ellen said Sorin is usually in meetings until the evening, so... ...let's save our house call until then. Why don't we go to the mooring dock and figure out our next move from there? Maya: Roger, Nick! Time travel (subsequent times) Phoenix: What you thought was time travel was really just a cover-up carried out by your in-laws. Pierce said Sorin was the one who ordered the whole thing. Ellen: I still can't believe it. Even if the second reception was fake... ...Sorin would never use time travel for something like that! He's very serious about his time machine research, you know! Phoenix: I heard there's a reason he's researching time machines, actually... ...Something about \"something he wishes he could change\"... But isn't the whole idea of traveling back in time itself a little... fantastic? Ellen: I don't think so! After all, Sorin said real time travelers do exist! Phoenix: Really, now? You think he knows someone who actually traveled through time? Ellen: That's right. I haven't seen it personally, but Sorin said as much... ...so I believe it. Phoenix: (Somebody who actually traveled through time, huh? It's pretty hard to believe...) After clearing \"Time travel\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: September 22Sprocket Park - Mooring Dock Phoenix: So, where should we start? Maya: Hmm... Let's see. Are there any places we haven't examined yet? We already investigated the reception hall, and Sprocket Manor... Phoenix: ...I know! We haven't looked at the vista deck or the hold yet! Maya: Hey, you're right! We've still got some pretty important places left to examine, don't we! The vista deck is the actual scene of the murder, right? Phoenix: And the lantern with the body in it was stored in the hold. I think there's a good chance we'll find some important clues in those locations. Maya: Do we know how to get to the hold? Phoenix: Good question. I think it was labeled in that diagram of the airship in this pamphlet. Maya: There it is! Phoenix: Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go! Examine Mooring tower Maya: So that one little tower is all that's keeping the airship from being blown away? Phoenix: Apparently. It must be sturdier than it looks. Maya: You know what it reminds me of? A single mom raising three kids while holding down a full-time job! Phoenix: S-Sure... (Where did that analogy even come from...?) Bench Phoenix: A strong wind blew this bench straight through the air, apparently. Maya: It looks like they fixed the sign, but left the bench right where it landed. I wonder why. Phoenix: Maybe the repair guy just hasn't gotten around to it yet. September 22Flying Chapel - Hold Phoenix: So this is the hold... (This is where Pierce orchestrated the whole cover-up operation... We'd better go over this place with a fine-tooth comb.) Maya: Hey, Nick...? Weren't we supposed to need a key card to get in here? Phoenix: Huh, you're right. I wonder why it was unlocked? ???: How's it going, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Ema! What are you doing here? Ema: Just a little independent investigating, for my own sake. Gotta keep the mind sharp! Phoenix: (Ah, so the door's security system was turned off for the police investigation.) We'd like to investigate the hold ourselves. Would that be all right? Ema: Yeah, sure. The police just finished their examination anyway. Phoenix: Thanks. We'll just take a quick look around, then. Ema: Oh, right! You should know that the floor doubles as a huge lift. You can use that lever way back there to raise it up to the vista deck. The police inspected it already, but didn't find anything of particular interest, it seems. If you do go up to the vista deck with the lift, be careful not to fall off! Phoenix: Got it. Thanks. Ema: That goes double for you, Maya! Maya: Yes, ma'am! Phoenix: Well, let's get this show on the road. Examine Engine or \"VISTA DECK\" sign Phoenix: So this is the airship's engine. It's pretty impressive. Maya: And it's all rhythmic, like a heartbeat! It's the literal heart of the Flying Chapel! Look at all those huge gears spinning around and around and around and around and... Ulp! I think I'm starting to get dizzy... Phoenix: Yeah... Me, too... Glassware Phoenix: These must be the dishes and glasses they use for receptions. Very fancy. I bet we'd be in big trouble if we broke any of them. Maya: Ooh! I wanna see, Nick! Phoenix: You, young lady, need to stay far, far away from them. Maya: Nick! You think I'm going to break them, don't you?! Phoenix: Let's just say your rap sheet for breaking things doesn't help your case. Flowers Maya: These are the flowers we saw in Larry's photo! Phoenix: The petals make them look like little gears. The perfect flower for the Sprocket family, huh? Maybe they were going to shower the couple with the petals? Maya: You mean, kind of like how people throw rice or confetti? Phoenix: Yeah, like that. Only, these were found at the scene of a murder instead... Model plane Maya: Ooh, look, Nick! It's an airplane! Phoenix: I wonder if Sorin built that one, too. Maya: Hey, why don't we take it for a spin? Just a quick tour around the neighborhood! Phoenix: And who do you propose is going to pilot that wooden deathtrap? Maya: Me, of course! Who else? Don't worry. I've seen people fly airplanes on TV plenty of times. Phoenix: Um... I think I'll pass. (I've still got my whole life ahead of me!) Bell Phoenix: What's that? A wedding bell? Maya: According to the pamphlet... ...it's used on the vista deck during wedding ceremonies to bless the newlyweds. Phoenix: I guess they disassemble and store it away here in the hold when it's not being used. Cake Maya: Ooh, it's a cake, Nick! A cake! It's so big, they wouldn't miss one little piece, would they? Phoenix: If you're that in the mood for a mouthful of styrofoam, knock yourself out. Maya: You mean it's not real...? Well, it sure fooled me... I was so ready to have some that I'm really craving cake now... Come on, Nick! Let's go get some! Phoenix: Maybe after the trial is over... Pegacow lanterns Phoenix: So there are two male Pegabull lanterns in the reception hall. That must mean... ...that these two are female Pegacow lanterns. Maya: Larry got their sexes mixed up when he replaced the one in the reception hall, huh? Didn't he see the horns? The difference is pretty glaring, if you ask me. Phoenix: And yet he managed not to notice. That's what makes Larry Larry. (And Larry being Larry is why I've seen more than my fair share of trouble for a lifetime...) Ema: Oh, Mr. Wright...? You know that lantern the victim was found inside of in the reception hall...? I'm just about to go piece it back together so the police can examine it. Phoenix: Oh? Okay. We'll stop by for a look, too, once you're done fixing it. Lever Phoenix: Oh, look. There's the lever to the lift Ema told us about. Maya: Let's try going up on it! I'll go flip the switch. Here goes nothing! Phoenix: Wait! I'm not even on it yet! H-Hey, Maya! Stop the lift! Maya: Whoops, sorry! I got a little carried away! Phoenix: Never mind that. Move over a little! Maya: O-Okay... Phoenix: Is that... blood? Ema: B-Blood? Let me see! Phoenix: Could it be Mr. Gloomsbury's blood? Ema: Well, this lift goes up to the vista deck where the murder took place, so... ...I think that's the most logical conclusion. Phoenix: (But I thought the victim was clubbed to death and that there wasn't much blood...? Something tells me I'd better take a picture of this...) Lift Bloodstain added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (I should ask Ema about it some more later.) Maya, can you bring the lift back down now? Maya: You got it! I'll go flip the switch again! There! Done! Phoenix: I want to find out some more about that bloodstain... But, for now, I guess we should go up to the vista deck... ...and take a look around the actual crime scene for ourselves. Maya: The view must be great from up there! I bet it'll be awesome! Phoenix: ...You mean, it would be, if it wasn't the scene of a murder... Maya: Okay! To the vista deck we go! Make sure you actually get ON the lift this time, Nick! Phoenix: I know, I know. Maya: Okay, I'll just flip the switch again, and... awaaaay we go! Maya: Wow! Look at the gorgeous view! Phoenix: So this is where Ellen was attacked, and Mr. Gloomsbury was killed... Yeesh. One wrong step, and it's \"kersplat!\" on the ground below. Maya: Should we go investigate the stuff that's a little closer to the edge? Phoenix: Well, I don't see much of anything over there. The police investigation didn't turn up any clues either, so... Maybe we don't need to? Maya: Oh, I get it! You're SCARED, aren't you, Nick? Phoenix: O-Of course not! C'mon, let's go back down and finish checking out the hold! Lever (subsequent times) Phoenix: It's the lever for the lift... What should we do? Go up to the vista deck Phoenix: Let's go up to the vista deck again. Maya: Okey-dokey! Aaaand up we go! Phoenix: Ugh... Well, I guess there really isn't anything to see up here... Let's go back down to the hold. Maya: But we just got here! Let's enjoy the view a little more! Phoenix: Time's a-wasting! L-Let's go, Maya! Maya: Aww... Leads back to examination Check out the bloodstain Phoenix: Maya, could you operate the lift for me? I want to see that bloodstain again. Maya: You got it! I just have to stop it partway up, right? So, first I'll throw the switch... there! Then, I'll press stop! Phoenix: Yeah... That's quite a bit of blood, all right. It's dry, but it doesn't look all that old. Maya: Do you think it's from the murder? Phoenix: I think so, but I'd need more info to be sure. Could you bring the lift back down now? Maya: Aye-aye, sir! Leads back to examination Leave it alone Phoenix: We'd better just leave it alone. Maya: Awwwww! I wanted to throw the switch! Phoenix: Maybe later... Leads back to examination Candelabra Phoenix: Huh? It looks like there are some fingerprints on this candelabra. Ema: Yeah. I just got done dusting that. I was able to pull a set of left hand prints. Phoenix: Do you know whose prints they are? Ema: Yes. The prints belong to the victim, Dumas Gloomsbury. Maya: Nick! I just figured out something amazing! Phoenix: You did? Maya: Get this -- if the fingerprints on the candelabra were from his left hand... ...then Mister Doom-n'-Gloom must've been... left-handed! What do you think of that? Do I have the makings of a great detective, or what? Phoenix: (You're a real silly Sally if you thought THAT deduction was in any way Encyclopedic...) (Changed from [Oh, yes. Your deductive reasoning skills are nearly Encyclopedic...] in the original release) Ema: Hey, you're pretty good, Maya! I looked into it myself, and sure enough, the victim really was left-handed. Maya: Really? I got it right? Awesome! Phoenix: Uh, good for you, Maya. Maya: \"Good for you\"? That's all you've got to say? Phoenix: I, uh, think you did a real great job, Maya. Way to go! (I guess one can never have too much info...) Maya: Now you're talking! Heh heh heh! Phoenix: But, come to think of it... ...this candelabra isn't in the photo Larry took of the hold, is it? Maya: That picture was taken when they were getting ready for the first reception, right? The candelabra must've been brought in here sometime after that, then. Phoenix: Hmm... It's still possible it has something to do with the incident, though. I'd better add it to the evidence file, just in case. Candelabra added to the Court Record. Ema: Oh, by the way, Mr. Wright... You can have this fingerprint powder, if you like. Phoenix: You're giving this to us? Ema: Sure. I have four other sets. Phoenix: Th-Thanks... (I feel like there's something more to the candelabra, but I can't put my finger on it...) Candelabra (subsequent times) Maya: I wonder where they sell candelabras like these... Phoenix: What, are you looking to buy some? Maya: I was thinking they'd be perfect for the altar candles in the Channeling Chamber at home. It might class up the place a little! Phoenix: I dunno... I can't really see them fitting in with the vibe of Kurain Village... Talk The incident Phoenix: Any progress with your investigation? Ema: Nothing conclusive yet, I'm afraid. Almost everybody was involved with the cover-up... ...so it's hard to know who or what to believe. Phoenix: I know what you mean. Ema: Unless you have some compelling evidence, I'm afraid it's going to be a tough trial for you. Phoenix: You're telling me... There isn't much time left, so I've just got to make do and see what I can turn up. The candelabra (appears after examining candelabra) Phoenix: Ema, can we check out this candelabra a little more? Ema: A little more? What do you-- Oops! Phoenix: Wh-What happened?! Ema: I almost dropped the candelabra, and the candles slipped off. Phoenix: Well, let's be careful with that. It might be important evidence. Ema: Wait a minute... Phoenix: Now what? Ema: One of the pins that hold the candles is broken. Phoenix: What? Ema: There's definitely something fishy about this candelabra! Phoenix: There is? What makes you say that? Ema: Call it forensic investigator's intuition! We already dusted this for prints earlier... ...so let's test it with luminol this time! Phoenix: (Knowing Ema, she'd use every test she has at the same time if she could...) Ema: Just hang on. This will only take a second. Phoenix: (I hope this turns up a new lead somehow...) Well, Ema? Did you find anything? Ema: Take a look at this, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: What is all that blood doing on there?! Candelabra updated in the Court Record. Ema: Maybe somebody got hurt while they were setting up for the reception? These pins are pretty sharp. Phoenix: But if one of the pins is broken... ...it means there was some force involved. Do you think maybe somebody got stabbed? Ema: B-But nobody reported anything like that... Phoenix: (That's quite a bit of blood. I wonder whose it is... If I have anything that might shed some light on that, I should probably show it to Ema...) The candelabra (subsequent times) Phoenix: Ema, can we check out this candelabra a little more? Ema: A little more? What do you-- Oops! Phoenix: Wh-What happened?! Ema: I almost dropped the candelabra, and the candles slipped off. Phoenix: Well, let's be careful with that. It might be important evidence. Ema: Wait a minute... Phoenix: Now what? Ema: One of the pins that hold the candles is broken. Phoenix: What? Ema: There's definitely something fishy about this candelabra! Phoenix: There is? What makes you say that? Ema: Call it forensic investigator's intuition! We already dusted this for prints earlier... ...so let's test it with luminol this time! Phoenix: (Knowing Ema, she'd use every test she has at the same time if she could...) Ema: Just hang on. This will only take a second. Phoenix: (I hope this turns up a new lead somehow...) Well, Ema? Did you find anything? Ema: Take a look at this, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: What is all that blood doing on there?! Ema: Maybe somebody got hurt while they were setting up for the reception? These pins are pretty sharp. Phoenix: But if one of the pins is broken... ...it means there was some force involved. Do you think maybe somebody got stabbed? Ema: B-But nobody reported anything like that... Phoenix: (That's quite a bit of blood. I wonder whose it is... If I have anything that might shed some light on that, I should probably show it to Ema...) The bloodstain (appears after presenting Lift Bloodstain; before clearing \"The candelabra\" Talk option) Phoenix: Ema, about this bloodstain... Ema: I'm thinking it's probably the victim's blood. Phoenix: But the victim was clubbed to death, right? Ema: Yeah, but he could've been bleeding from his nose, or maybe he spat it out. I won't really know for sure until I look into it some more. Phoenix: I see. (There's still something about it that bothers me, though...) The bloodstain (appears after presenting Lift Bloodstain; after clearing \"The candelabra\" Talk option) Phoenix: About this bloodstain... Ema: What about it? Phoenix: There's something about it that's been bothering me. Ema: Oh, yeah? What's that? Phoenix: Well, there's a huge bloodstain on the crime scene lift, and a bloodstained candelabra... Now, this is only a guess, but I'm thinking maybe these two bloodstains are from... The same source Leads to: \"I'm thinking maybe these two bloodstains are from the same source.\" Different sources Phoenix: I'm thinking maybe these two bloodstains are from completely different sources. Ema: Yes, that's what I'm thinking, too. So, what about it? Phoenix: (Oh, hmm... Being in agreement won't lead us anywhere new... I need to find out more about these bloodstains somehow...) Sorry! That's not what I meant to say... Leads to: \"I'm thinking maybe these two bloodstains are from the same source.\" Phoenix: I'm thinking maybe these two bloodstains are from the same source. Ema: Hmm... I guess that IS a possibility. Phoenix: Can we compare the two bloodstains? Would that take a lot of time? Ema: Are you kidding? Don't underestimate the power of science! It'll be done in a jiffy! Ema: And the results are in! That didn't take long, now, did it? Hmm... It seems that the blood from the lift and candelabra are from the same person. Lift Bloodstain updated in the Court Record. Candelabra updated in the Court Record. Phoenix: Well, the victim was clubbed to death, and there wasn't all that much blood... Ema: But if this isn't Mr. Gloomsbury's blood... Phoenix: Well, this is just a guess, but... ...what if Mr. Gloomsbury stabbed somebody with the candelabra pin? That would explain both the huge bloodstain on the lift and the blood on the candelabra. Ema: Oh, my goodness! If that's true... ...then that means there was somebody else present at the scene of the murder! Phoenix: It does, doesn't it? (This just might substantiate Ellen's statement about a third person!) Ema, could you have this blood analyzed? Ema: Sure thing! The bloodstain (after clearing \"The candelabra\" Talk option; subsequent times) Phoenix: About this bloodstain... Ema: What about it? Phoenix: There's something about it that's been bothering me. Ema: Oh, yeah? What's that? Phoenix: Well, there's a huge bloodstain on the crime scene lift, and a bloodstained candelabra... Now, this is only a guess, but I'm thinking maybe these two bloodstains are from... The same source Leads to: \"I'm thinking maybe these two bloodstains are from the same source.\" Different sources Phoenix: I'm thinking maybe these two bloodstains are from completely different sources.

That would explain both the huge bloodstain on the lift and the blood on the candelabra. Ema: Oh, my goodness! If that's true... ...then that means there was somebody else present at the scene of the murder! Phoenix: It does, doesn't it? (This just might substantiate Ellen's statement about a third person!) Ema, could you have this blood analyzed? Ema: Sure thing! Present Lift Bloodstain Phoenix: Ema, about this bloodstain... Doesn't something about it strike you as odd? Ema: What's so odd about the victim's blood? Phoenix: That's not exactly... There's just something about it that bothers me. Ema: Hmm... Now that you mention it... ...I can't say I necessarily disagree with you. Phoenix: (Maybe I should talk about this some more with her...) After clearing \"The incident\" Talk option, correctly clearing \"The bloodstain\" Talk option, and examining Pegacow lanterns: Phoenix: Hmm... A mysterious bloodstain on a candelabra with the victim's prints on it... This just might be the thing to back up Ellen's memory of seeing a third person. Next up, the reception hall. It might be worth taking another look around in there. Ema: The reception hall? The forensics team is in there investigating right now. Phoenix: Oh, they are? Maya: Well, we don't have time to just sit around, so let's go check out something else! Phoenix: Good idea. We could go question some people. (Especially Sorin. I have quite a few questions for that guy.) Maya: Sounds good, Nick! Ema: Off to do some legwork, then? Phoenix: Yup. I thought we'd head to Sorin's house for starters. Ema: He was accompanying the police on their investigation here earlier, but... ...he's probably home by now. Phoenix: Great, thanks. Later, Ema. Wright Anything Agency or Mooring Dock Present Lift Bloodstain Phoenix: To think they fought for their lives here, on what was supposed to be an uplifting day... Maya: Nick! You do realize this a murder case, right?! Phoenix: Huh? D-Did I say something wrong? Maya; What are you thinking, making such an insensitive pun about this lift?! Phoenix: (What pun? All I said was that it was supposed to be an uplifting day... Oh. Th-That wasn't supposed to be a pun!) Maya: I strongly suggest you don't say anything like that in front of the Sprocket family! Phoenix: Y-Yes, ma'am... Candelabra Maya: That's quite a fancy candelabra, huh? Maybe I should get a few just like it for the altar in the Channeling Chamber at home. Phoenix: I can't really see these things going well with the vibe of Kurain Village... Maya: But they're perfect! They can even hold the really big candles! And they look so cool, too! Phoenix: (That's going to be one eclectic altar once Maya's done redecorating...) September 22Sprocket Manor - Foyer Maya: I still can't get over how gorgeous Sprocket Manor is! Phoenix: Just don't touch anything. Maya: I--! I wasn't going to! Phoenix: (She was DEFINITELY going to...) ???: I was told I had guests... Phoenix: Thank you for seeing us, Sorin. We know you're busy. We'd like to ask you a few questions about the case, if you wouldn't mind. Sorin: ............ Phoenix: Um... Sorin? Sorin: You're Ellen's lawyer, right? Phoenix: Huh...? Y-Yes, that's right. (Don't tell me he doesn't remember me...?) Sorin: ...Will Ellen be found guilty? Phoenix: We're doing everything we can to prevent that. That's why we're here, investigating. Will you please tell us what you know? Sorin: ............ Phoenix: Sorin...? Sorin: .........All right. Fine. Phoenix: (What was that pause all about?) Examine Photos on table Man: Aha! Come back to hear more about my camera, have you? Phoenix: I-I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I'm really busy right now. Man: Oh. What a shame. Well, if you ever want to talk about cameras, come back and see me anytime. Phoenix: (Sounds like even his own family members don't want to listen to him...) Bouquet Maya: Hey, Nick! Better watch out, or you'll be cursed by the bouquet of woe. Phoenix: Oh, come on, Maya. Like I'm going to believe an urban legend you just made up. Talk The cover-up Phoenix: It was you who gave the order for that large-scale cover-up plan, isn't that right? Sorin: What \"large-scale cover-up\"...? Maya: Don't play dumb with us! You held two wedding receptions in order to try and cover up Mr. Gloomsbury's murder! Phoenix: Ellen thought that, through the power of the Time Keeper you built... ...she traveled back in time. Sorin: Ah... So that's why there were two receptions... Phoenix: (Wait, does he seriously not know why the reception was held twice? Looks like I'll have to delve deeper here...) Time travel (appears after \"The cover-up\") Phoenix: So, the cover-up scheme -- that fake trip through time... ...you're not the one who was behind it all? Pierce Nichody stated in court that you were the one who ordered it to be carried out. Sorin: Pierce said that...? I see. I leave him in charge of everything around me. So whatever he decides is, in essence, my decision, too. Phoenix: So I take it that you didn't know anything about the cover-up? Sorin: ......That's none of your business. Phoenix: But you were in two wedding receptions in a row! And still, you claim to know nothing? Sorin: ...I have nothing more to say to you. Please leave. Phoenix: B-But, Sorin...! Ow! Maya: Oh, there's something written on this paper airplane! Let's see... \"Go away!\" Phoenix: It doesn't get clearer than that, huh... (He's looking especially uncooperative, but... ...maybe I can grab his attention somehow. There's still that one piece of evidence I don't know much about... It's worth a try...) Present Selena Sprocket Photo Sorin: Sis... Phoenix: I'm sure your sister would want the truth of this case to be known. Sorin: ...How rude. Is intruding on the private lives of others... ...a part of your job as a lawyer? Phoenix: Oh... I, uh... I apologize. (I guess showing him the picture of his sister wasn't such a good idea after all.) Candelabra (after clearing \"Time travel\" Talk option) Leads to: \"Sorin, have you ever seen this before?\" Phoenix: Sorin, have you ever seen this before? Sorin: Th-That's... That's...! Phoenix: Sorin, what is it? Sorin: N-Nothing...! Phoenix: (Why did his whole demeanor change all of a sudden? He's gone pale as a ghost, too...) *thud* Phoenix: S-Sorin! Maya: Nick! Look at his stomach! He's bleeding! Phoenix: S-Somebody, help! Sorin's collapsed! Maid: Master Sorin! Relative: Get him to the hospital! Quickly, now! Maya: Poor Sorin... That must be one serious wound... Phoenix: Hmm... Maya: What is it, Nick? Phoenix: Well, when I showed him the candelabra, his whole demeanor changed... So I was just thinking that maybe his injury is... Maya: Huh? What's this? Phoenix: It's Sorin's notebook. He must've dropped it in the rush to get him to the hospital. Maya: Ooh, his notebook, huh...? I wonder what's written in it. Don't you? Come on! You know you wanna take a peek! Phoenix: Sorin's notebook... What to do, what to do...? Take a peek Leads to: \"I feel guilty, snooping around in somebody's personal notebook, but...\" Don't look Phoenix: I really don't think we should... Maya: But it might have some really, really, REALLY important information in it! Phoenix: Yes, that's quite possible, but still... (Well, I guess it IS for Ellen's sake, at the end of the day...) Leads to: \"I feel guilty, snooping around in somebody's personal notebook, but...\" Phoenix: I feel guilty, snooping around in somebody's personal notebook, but... ...maybe we SHOULD take a little look-see. Whoa! It's filled with big words written in tiny letters! I guess he uses this notebook to write down his invention ideas? ...Huh? Maya: What is it? Did you find something? Phoenix: Hmm... After March 8th of last year, the content of this notebook changes dramatically. Maya: Like how? Phoenix: Well... Ever since that date, Sorin's been writing down every detail of his life. As in EVERY. Maya: Maybe he decided to start keeping a diary? Phoenix: But this is way too detailed to be an ordinary diary. Maya: Hmm... Either he's really compulsive... ...or maybe just plain forgetful. Phoenix: (But is it really as simple as that...?) I feel like something happened on March 8th that made Sorin change. Maya: Well, why don't you let me take a look at that, and I'll tell you! Phoenix: H-Hey! Maya! Let go or we'll rip it! Maya: Eep! Now look what you did! You dropped it! You should've just let me take a look! Phoenix: (How is this MY fault...?) Maya: Oh, no! Nick... Phoenix: Ack! It fell into that pool of Sorin's blood! I can't read a thing on these two pages now... Maya: Uh-oh! You're gonna get it now! Phoenix: (Ugh... I guess it really is my fault after all...) Let's just put it away carefully for now. We can't let anything else happen to it, you hear? Sorin's Notebook added to the Court Record. Maya: Huh? Hey look, there's something sticking out of the notebook. It looks like a newspaper article. Phoenix: Let's see... It's about the car accident Sorin's sister died in! It happened on... March 8th... That's the day Sorin's notebook completely changed... Oh, wow! Maya: Wh-What else does it say?! Phoenix: It says the driver at the time of the accident was... Dumas Gloomsbury. It says Sorin was in the car, too, and that he had sustained severe injuries. It's just like Pierce said. Sorin completely changed after the accident. Newspaper Article added to the Court Record. Phoenix: So Gloomsbury was driving the car when they got into that accident... That opens up the distinct possibility... Maya: Of...? Phoenix: Of Sorin holding a grudge against Gloomsbury. Maya: You think Sorin could've...? Phoenix: I don't know. It's not like I have any proof... We should talk to Pierce about this when we return Sorin's notebook to him. ...Though he doesn't seem to be here right now. Maybe he's at the Flying Chapel. Wright Anything Agency or Reception Hall Present Sorin's Notebook Maya: Oh, it's the notebook you dropped! Phoenix: The notebook \"I\" dropped?! It only ended up where it did because you tried to snatch it out of my hands! Maya: Well... maybe I was a TINY bit complicit in it... Look! No one's to blame here, right? It was just an accident! Right?! Phoenix: Oh, I think we both know who's more to blame... Newspaper Article Maya: This is about the car accident Sorin's sister died in... I bet she would've wanted to see her little brother get married... Phoenix: Yeah... But with the way things are, I don't think she'll be able to rest in peace. So we'll just have to figure out the truth somehow... For her sake, too. Maya: Yeah. Let's not leave a single stone unturned and push on in our investigation! September 22Sprocket Park - Mooring Dock Phoenix: I sure hope Pierce is around here somewhere. ???: Ah, Mr. Wright and Ms. Fey. Phoenix: Hello, Pierce. We were just looking for you. Nichody: I'm sorry for Master Sorin's sudden departure earlier. You have my sincerest apologies. Phoenix: It was totally understandable, really. But shouldn't you be at his side right now? Nichody: It's fine. The other servants are with him, and I am in constant contact with them. Do not forget to give him his pain medication, and be sure to keep him hydrated. Also, see to it that he is not up and about. He needs complete bed rest. Phoenix: (Is this what happens when you're too rich for normal, peasant phones...?) Nichody: I must return to Master Sorin now, but... ...did you want something of me? Phoenix: Actually, here's Sorin's notebook. He dropped it when he collapsed. (I hope Pierce doesn't notice the bloodstain!) Nichody: Oh. Thank you very much for this. I will see to it personally that Master Sorin gets it back. Phoenix: Thank you. Sorin's Notebook given to Pierce. Nichody: I trust you did not look inside? Phoenix: Oh, of course not! Aha ha! Nichody: Because it is filled with numerous patent-worthy ideas, you see. Phoenix: Look, I know you're busy, but would you mind if I asked you a few questions about the case? Nichody: Well, as I said, I must be getting back to Master Sorin. So if you could make it quick, I would greatly appreciate it. Phoenix: All right. I'll make this as quick as I can. Talk The cover-up Phoenix: I'd like to ask you about the cover-up you tried to pull off, if you don't mind. Nichody: I told everything there is to tell in court already. Disposing of anything that may harm the Sprocket family's reputation... ...is simply a part of my job. Phoenix: (Sounds like a lovely job description...) Nichody: I have nothing more to say on the matter. I will say, I do not think it's wise to spend time on topics that have already been discussed. Phoenix: Right. The accident (appears after \"The cover-up\") Phoenix: Pierce, could you tell us more about this accident? Nichody: Where did you find that...? And did I not already tell you about that accident? Phoenix: You did, but you conveniently left out one crucial detail: The fact that Dumas Gloomsbury was driving the car at the time. Nichody: Oh? Did I not mention that? I suppose it simply did not come up then. Phoenix: If Mr. Gloomsbury caused the accident... ...why didn't the Sprocket family fire him? Wouldn't that usually be the natural consequence of such a huge mistake? Nichody: Please do not misunderstand. Gloomsbury stayed on with the family... ...on Master Sorin's request. Phoenix: (What...?) Nichody: That is the type of person Master Sorin is. Perhaps it was the influence of Miss Selena's kind nature. She was such a sweet person that even in her last moments, she thought of Master Sorin. Phoenix: (Not only did Sorin NOT hold a grudge against Gloomsbury, he insisted on keeping him on. Now I REALLY don't understand how that guy's mind works...) Selena's last moments (appears after \"The accident\") Phoenix: So you were present for Selena Sprocket's last moments...? Nichody: Yes, in my professional capacity... The accident happened on the way to a certain party. Phoenix: And what kind of a party was it? Nichody: It was Miss Selena's engagement party. Gloomsbury's injuries were minor, but Miss Selena's and Master Sorin's were critical. They were brought to the Sprocket family's regular hospital. Phoenix: (Wow... To have such a terrible thing happen on what was to be a day of celebration...) Nichody: Thanks to the surgeon in charge, Master Sorin pulled through. But Miss Selena... She... Phoenix: ............ Nichody: The last words Miss Selena said to me were... \"Please help Sorin.\" Nichody: Ever since then, I have attended Master Sorin and tried to help him in any way I can. Phoenix: I see... Selena's fianc\u00e9 must have been devastated. Nichody: Indeed. The shock of losing Miss Selena was so great, he quit being a surgeon. Phoenix: He was a surgeon? Wait... So the surgeon who tried to save them both, was he...? Nichody: Yes, he was Miss Selena's fianc\u00e9. Maya: What a terrible tragedy... Phoenix: How awful... So where is her fianc\u00e9 now? Nichody: ...Good question. I wonder that sometimes myself. Phoenix: (So Selena had a fianc\u00e9... I'd like to find out more about him, but I doubt I'll find him any time soon.) Nichody: So, are we done here? I'm afraid I must be going. Phoenix: Could you please just tell me... ...a little more about Sorin? Nichody: There is nothing more to tell. Phoenix: (I can't seem to get any real answers out of him just by asking him questions. But there IS that piece of evidence I still don't know much about... Maybe he'll be able to tell me something about it.) Selena's last moments (subsequent times) Phoenix: So you were present for Selena Sprocket's last moments...? Nichody: Yes, in my professional capacity... The accident happened on the way to a certain party. Phoenix: And what kind of a party was it? Nichody: It was Miss Selena's engagement party. Gloomsbury's injuries were minor, but Miss Selena's and Master Sorin's were critical. They were brought to the Sprocket family's regular hospital. Phoenix: (Wow...

Pierce's secret (appears after correctly presenting Candelabra) Phoenix: Pierce. You're hiding something from me about this candelabra, aren't you? Nichody: It is one of the candelabras from the Flying Chapel, is it not? Is there something special about it? 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (My magatama is definitely reacting. I guess I'll just have to break those Psyche-Locks and find out what he's got to hide!) Present Magatama Phoenix: 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Pierce's Secret -- Phoenix: Pierce. You're hiding something from me about this candelabra, aren't you? Nichody: It is one of the candelabras from the Flying Chapel, is it not? Is there something special about it? Phoenix: Actually, yes -- there's some blood on it, you see. I think the blood might belong to this person. Present Sorin Sprocket profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Sorin has a rather nasty wound on his body, doesn't he?\" Present anyone else Phoenix: Nichody: What does that person have to do with it? Phoenix: (Ack! That's not who I meant to name!) Nichody: I do not have time for meaningless conversation... Phoenix: I'm sorry! Please give me another chance! Leads back to: \"I think the blood might belong to this person.\" Phoenix: Sorin has a rather nasty wound on his body, doesn't he? Nichody: Ngh... 1 LOCK BROKEN Nichody: Yes, Master Sorin is indeed injured. Phoenix: Are any of the other people involved with this case injured? Nichody: N-Not as far as I know... Phoenix: ...I see. Then, let me ask you this, Pierce. Do you suppose Sorin could have been more directly involved than you're letting on? Nichody: Wh-What in the world would make you think that...? Phoenix: Oh, I've got my reasons. Mr. Gloomsbury's fingerprints were found on this candelabra's stem. Which leads me to believe that Mr. Gloomsbury stabbed Sorin with it. Nichody: You cannot possibly think Master Sorin is the one responsible for the murder. Phoenix: I don't have any conclusive evidence of that at the moment... ...but I do think he had a motive. This proves that Sorin had a motive to kill Mr. Gloomsbury. Present Newspaper Article Phoenix: Leads to: \"Even though it was an accident...\" Present anything else Phoenix: Nichody: How does that prove that Master Sorin had a motive to commit the murder? Phoenix: Huh? (Wrong piece, I guess!) Never mind that. I didn't mean it! Nichody: My time is limited, Mr. Wright, so please do hurry. Leads back to: \"This proves that Sorin had a motive to kill Mr. Gloomsbury.\" Phoenix: Even though it was an accident... ...Mr. Gloomsbury was the man responsible for taking Sorin's sister away. 1 LOCK BROKEN Nichody: Let us suppose... that Gloomsbury did stab Master Sorin with the candelabra... Can you prove that it had anything to do with this case? He might have been stabbed at some other location, for some other reason... Phoenix: Sorry, but I can prove it WAS related to this case. Nichody: Oh, really? Phoenix: Sorin's stabbing and Mr. Gloomsbury's death are definitely connected. Nichody: Are they now...? Phoenix: This is the piece of evidence that ties Sorin's injury to Mr. Gloomsbury's murder. Present Lift Bloodstain Phoenix: Leads to: \"A bloodstain was found on the side of the lift that goes between the hold and vista deck.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Nichody: ...I'm not sure what you're trying to tie together with that. Phoenix: (Argh! Guess that wasn't it!) Nichody: I'll have a servant send you home... Phoenix: No, wait! Please give me another chance. Nichody: Please, Mr. Wright. Do not detain me with nonsense any longer... Leads back to: \"This is the piece of evidence that ties Sorin's injury to Mr. Gloomsbury's murder.\" Phoenix: A bloodstain was found on the side of the lift that goes between the hold and vista deck. Its blood matches the blood that's on the candelabra. I obtained the results straight from the police, so I can assure you this information is correct. Nichody: ............ Phoenix: This bloodstain on the lift indicates an important fact. It shows us that... The murder was in the reception hall Phoenix: The true scene of the murder was in the reception hall. Nichody: ............ ............ ............ ............ Phoenix: All right, so I kinda just said the first thing that popped into my mind... ...but now that I think about it, I take it back. Nichody: ...Twenty-six seconds, Mr. Wright. It took you twenty-six seconds to realize your mistake. Phoenix: Look, just please forget about that one! Nichody: *sigh* Leads back to: \"This bloodstain on the lift indicates an important fact. It shows us that...\" Sorin was there during the crime Leads to: \"Sorin's blood is on the lift, which can only mean one thing.\" Gloomsbury wasn't there Phoenix: Mr. Gloomsbury wasn't at the crime scene! Nichody: How does the bloodstain on the lift tell you that? Phoenix: Well, er... I guess it really doesn't, does it? Nichody: If you insist on speaking nonsense, I will have to ask you to let me leave. Phoenix: N-No more nonsense this time! I promise! Leads back to: \"This bloodstain on the lift indicates an important fact. It shows us that...\" Phoenix: Sorin's blood is on the lift, which can only mean one thing. He was there, wasn't he? Sorin was at the scene of the crime. Nichody: You are very astute, Mr. Wright. It appears I cannot hide this from you any longer. Very well. I will tell you everything. 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Pierce's secret (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Leads to: \"Could you tell me about Sorin's injury?\" Present Selena Sprocket Photo Nichody: I hope you will refrain from showing this to Master Sorin. He is still suffering the loss of Miss Selena. Phoenix: B-But... Nichody: I do not believe rubbing salt in people's wounds is part of a lawyer's job. Or am I mistaken? Phoenix: A-All right. I understand. Candelabra or Lift Bloodstain (before clearing \"Selena's last moments\" Talk option) Phoenix: Do you recognize this, Pierce? Nichody: ...It is not really something I care to look at. Phoenix: But it was you and the others who tried to cover things up in the hold, wasn't it? Nichody: I left that entirely to my subordinates, so I really don't know anything about it myself. Phoenix: (Pierce was in charge of handling the guests and relatives... ...so he must know a lot more than he's letting on.) Candelabra (after clearing \"Selena's last moments\" Talk option, before breaking Psyche-Locks) Phoenix: Pierce. Have you ever seen this candelabra before? Nichody: I-I... No, I don't know anything about it... 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (My magatama reacted! Pierce must be trying to hide something from me. I have to break those Psyche-Locks and find out what!) Candelabra (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Phoenix: Sorin was stabbed by Mr. Gloomsbury, right? Nichody: Yes, it is just as I told you earlier. And then, after he had been stabbed, Master Sorin did make his way to the vista deck... But that was after Gloomsbury had been murdered. Phoenix: (Well, it's a fact that Sorin was injured... But now I really don't know what's the truth and what's fiction anymore...) Nichody: It matters not if you believe me or not. If this comes up in court, I will say the same thing to prove Master Sorin's innocence. Phoenix: Well, I guess I'll believe you... for now. Nichody: Heh. Newspaper Article Nichody: Even now, it is painful to remember the accident. And Master Sorin is not the only one who suffers still. The entire Sprocket family was plunged into deep sorrow. A sorrow they still feel to this day. Phoenix: (Now I can understand why Sorin changed so much after the accident...) Nichody: That is why I do not want you to bring up the car accident again. I hope you understand. Phoenix: Y-Yes, I understand. (So I guess that topic is out...) Phoenix: Could you tell me about Sorin's injury? Nichody: ...Very well. This is what I heard directly from Master Sorin himself. As you surmised, Master Sorin was stabbed by Gloomsbury on the day of the murder. It happened after the first wedding reception. The happy couple was in the reception hall when, suddenly, Gloomsbury appeared... He attacked Miss Ellen and tried to take her away. Master Sorin went to stop him, and found himself in a struggle with Gloomsbury. That is when Master Sorin was stabbed with the candelabra, he said. Even though Master Sorin was badly injured, he went after Gloomsbury. Phoenix: So Sorin really was at the scene of the murder, wasn't he? Nichody: Yes, that is correct. However, by the time Master Sorin arrived at the scene... ...Gloomsbury had already been murdered. Phoenix: (So Pierce is saying that Sorin WAS at the crime scene... ...but that he didn't have anything to do with the murder itself. Hmm...) Even still, why did you try to keep such an important piece of information from me?! Nichody: I am very sorry. Master Sorin's injury and Gloomsbury's murder were not directly related... ...so I decided not to mention it, so as not to unnecessarily complicate the investigation. ...Now, then. I am sorry, but I am afraid I really must go now. Please excuse me. Phoenix: Thank you for your time. Maya: Pierce should've just told us everything in the first place and saved us all a lot of time! Phoenix: Yeah... But I guess it isn't that simple for him -- he is the family butler, after all. He sure didn't make our job any easier, though, did he? But at least we learned something new. Sorin was at the scene of the crime! Maya: That's true! One step forward is better than none! So, what next, Nick? Phoenix: Hmm... Let's see. The forensics team might be done investigating the reception hall by now. Let's go check it out. Maya: Sounds like a plan! Wright Anything Agency, Foyer, or Hold Talk Any ideas? Phoenix: Is it just me, or does Sorin seem kinda suspicious...? Maya: Yeah... I mean, he's so quiet, who knows what he's thinking, right? And that Pierce isn't exactly an open book, either. It seems like they're both hiding something. Phoenix: Yeah, though that could be true of everyone involved in this case, for all we know. Maya: Hey, I know! Let's make a new rule! The next time anybody lies in court, we get to bop them on the head with the judge's gavel! Phoenix: Sounds more like a game of Whack-A-Mole than a trial to me... Still, I wouldn't necessarily say no... What to do Maya: What's wrong, Nick? Phoenix: Oh, I was just thinking about how hard it's been to find out the truth this time around... Maya: What are you talking about? When has it EVER been easy to find out the truth in any of our cases? You just do what you always do! Bluff your way through things, and we'll be fine! Phoenix: (But that's supposed to be my tactic of last resort...) September 22Flying Chapel - Reception Hall Phoenix: It looks like the police are done with their investigation in here. I wonder if it's okay for us to take a look around now. ???: Oh, hi, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Hi, Ema. Would it be all right if we investigate in this room now? Ema: Sure. The police are all done, so go for it. Oh, remember that broken lantern? I restored it to perfection! I have to say, it's some of my best work! Phoenix: (Sounds like the repair job was a resounding success...) Thanks, Ema. We'll take a good look at it, too. Ema: Well, I have to be getting back to the station... Try not to mess up the crime scene if you can help it. Phoenix: We'll be careful. Ema: I'll be seeing you! Maya: Bye, Ema! And thank you! Phoenix: Well, shall we get started? Examine \"EXIT\" door Phoenix: Hey, take a look at that door. I wonder where it goes. Maya: Shall we open it up and see? Maid: Wait! Please don't open that! It's the emergency escape hatch! It leads directly outside! You'll fall to your death! Phoenix: Whew... That was a close one, huh, Maya? Maya: I-I'll say... Fog machine below model plane Maya: Excuse me. Is the fog machine ready to use now? Maid: No, I'm afraid not. We only put dry ice in it when there's an actual reception. Maya: I see... That's too bad... Phoenix: (She still wants to blast me with a cloud of smoke, doesn't she...) Sweetheart area of reception hall Windows Maya: It's another beautiful day outside, isn't it? Phoenix: Yeah. If only it wasn't the scene of a murder, we could really enjoy it... Maya: True... Phoenix: It must be tough for the maids to have to work on a beautiful day like today. Maid: Oh, we don't mind. Phoenix: Whoa! I didn't think you could hear me way over here! Maid: We don't think of it as simply cleaning. It's more like we're wiping away all of the sadness stuck to this airship... Phoenix: (Wow. Talk about devoted...) Sweetheart table Maya: Hey! I think that tablecloth is new. They must've changed it since yesterday! Phoenix: Huh? How can you tell? Maya: Because the food stains that were there are now gone! Phoenix: (I should've known it's because it's food-related...) Smaller table Phoenix: This is where the murder weapon, the Time Keeper, was displayed. I guess it's in police custody now. ...Huh? What's this? A key? Maya: Let's ask the maid about it. Phoenix: Good idea. She might be able to tell us something. Excuse me. Could I ask you a question? Maid: Oh, of course. What would you like to know? Phoenix: Do you know anything about this key? Maid: It's the key that starts up the Time Keeper. Phoenix: A startup key? Maid: That's right. Oh, the First Startup of Love ceremony was so beautiful! The bride and groom each had a symbol of their love, and when they put them together... Oh, how romantic it was! Key of Love added to the Court Record. Phoenix: First Startup of Love ceremony? What exactly did that entail? Maid: Oh, er... It's a ceremony in which the couple activated the Time Keeper together for the first time. I suppose it was kind of like a cake-cutting ceremony. Phoenix: And what are these \"symbols of their love\" you mentioned? Maid: Well... that's kind of an industry secret, so I can't really say. I'm sorry. I'd better be getting back to my work... Phoenix: (Looks like there's an order from above not to talk about it.) Smaller table (subsequent times) Phoenix: This is where the murder weapon, the Time Keeper, was displayed.

Repaired Pegabull lantern Phoenix: Here's the broken lantern, all patched up. (And I do mean \"patched\"...) Maya: Ema said this was some of her best work, so I know she put a lot of effort into it! Phoenix: It was pretty smashed up. It must've been a lot of work to piece it back together. (Well, she gets an A for effort, at any rate...) ...Huh? This wheel handle on the back has some blood on it! It looks like somebody gripped it with a bloody hand... Maya: Maybe the blood got there when the killer was putting ol' Doom-n'-Gloom's body inside? Do you see anything else worth noting? Phoenix: Well, there's another one of these lanterns over there... ...so it might be a good idea to really compare the two later. Broken Lantern updated in the Court Record. Repaired Pegabull lantern (subsequent times) Maya: Ema must've worked really hard on this. Maid: You mean that police lady? She was going at it like a jigsaw puzzle. All \"Not this piece\" here, \"Not that piece\" there... Phoenix: It was pretty busted up. I can just imagine what a hard time she had figuring it all out. Maya: She should've asked me to help! I would've loved to restore this thing with her! Phoenix: I think it's best to leave that kind of thing to the police. (Besides, who knows what kind of liberties Maya would've taken in the process...?) Intact Pegabull lantern Maya: ...N-Nick! Phoenix: What's wrong, Maya?! Maya: ......This hasn't moved an inch since the last time we looked at it. Phoenix: (It would be pretty creepy if it had...) Look, we're in the middle of an important investigation, so try not to shout, okay? Maya: I was just hoping it had changed somehow. You know, so it would be more interesting. Phoenix: The last thing we need is for things to get more \"interesting.\" Intact Pegabull lantern (after examining repaired Pegabull lantern) Phoenix: This is the unbroken Pegabull lantern. And this is the one that Ema restored. I wouldn't say they look exactly the same... More that they're made up of the same parts. Maya: Wait a minute... Phoenix: What is it, Maya? Maya: I think there's something off about this Pegabull. Phoenix: Just about everything about it looks off to me... Maya: I'm not quite sure what it is, but some detail isn't quite right. Show me the restored lantern again. Phoenix: Hey, I know! It's this, right? Maya: What? Where? Phoenix: The thing about the restored lantern that's off is the... Shape of the horns Phoenix: The shape of the horns is different, isn't it? How they're curved, and their size, and stuff? Maya: I don't know... The curve and size seem the same as the unbroken one to me. Phoenix: Yeah, I guess you're right. They're pretty much identical, huh. In that case... Leads back to: \"The thing about the restored lantern that's off is the...\" Angle of the wings Phoenix: I've got it! The angle of that wing is different. And it's attached all wrong! Maya: Well duh, Nick! I could've told you THAT! I mean there's something more subtle... Something that feels just slightly off. You know what I mean? Phoenix: (No, not really... Still, maybe it's...) Leads back to: \"The thing about the restored lantern that's off is the...\" Color of the wheel handle Leads to: \"Look. It's the wheel handle. It's a different color altogether.\" Phoenix: Look. It's the wheel handle. It's a different color altogether. Ema got the inside and outside wheel handles switched around. Maya: Oh, wow! You're right! And there's blood here on this handle -- as if somebody gripped it with a bloody hand. Phoenix: Right. Which means that the blood got on the handle from inside the lantern. Broken Lantern updated in the Court Record. Maya: Do you think the blood got there when the killer was putting the body in the lantern? Phoenix: Hmm... It's really hard to say, at this point. Talk Any ideas? Maya: I don't know... I really wonder about that Pierce... Phoenix: Yeah, I know what you mean. He seems to have a lot of power over everybody and everything, doesn't he? Maya: Actually, what I was really wondering about is that shoulder mech of his... I mean, it's pretty amazing how many things that tiny little contraption can do. Ooh! What if that  mech is actually Pierce's true control center, like his brain? Phoenix: Um... Maya...? Maya: And what if, somewhere in Sprocket Manor, he has another shiny, golden body! And then, during emergencies, he can switch bodies and become Super Pierce Nichody! Phoenix: This is what I get for trying to have a serious conversation with a super geek... What to do Phoenix: I bet all Ellen wants is to start her happy new life with Sorin. Maya: Yeah... I bet you're right... Phoenix: But do you think the truth will really set her free...? Maya: All you can do is do your job to the best of your ability! And if we can bring Ellen joy that way, all the better, right?! Phoenix: Maya... Maya: Either way, I think true happiness can only be found in the truth. ... Um, what are you looking at me like that for? Phoenix: I was just thinking about how wise that sounded. Looks like our little Maya is growing up! Maya: Would you knock it off? I'm trying to be serious here! Phoenix: S-Sorry! Sorry! Present Broken Lantern (after examining repaired Pegabull lantern) Maya: Ema did a pretty good job fixing this guy up. Is it just me, or does this Pegabull look happy to be whole again? Still... Phoenix: Still...? Maya: If Ema had let me do it, I could've made it ten times cooler! I would've made the wings bigger, given it three horns, and painted it all red. But that's not all! Phoenix: It would've ceased to be a Pegabull waaay before that point, Maya... After examining \"EXIT\" door, smaller table, and repaired Pegabull lantern, then examining intact Pegabull lantern: Phoenix: Whew! Well, I think we've checked out everything relevant to this case. ???: What are you two doing here? Phoenix: Wait, what are YOU doing here?! Sorin! Shouldn't you be resting in bed? You're injured! Sorin: How do you know about that?! ...Um, never mind. My notebook... Have you seen my notebook? I can't find it anywhere. My notebook... I need my notebook... Phoenix: (What's the matter with him?) Sorin: M-My notebook... I need... I have to have... I-I... ???: Master Sorin! Nichody: Master Sorin! I told you to stay in bed! Sorin: M-My notebook...! Nichody: Here you go. Sorin: Yes... This is it...! Phoenix: (So Sorin gets emotionally unstable without that notebook of his...?) Sorin: ...Phew. Phoenix: (Looks like he's calmed down now.) Sorin, do you mind if I talk to you for a minute? Nichody: I cannot allow you to do that. What if his wound were to open up again? He needs to rest. Phoenix: Arngh... I guess you're right... Nichody: Now, if you will excuse us. Master Sorin, let us retire. Sorin: ...All right. Maya: There they go. Phoenix: Pierce is right. I guess he really isn't in any condition to be questioned. Well, let's go back to the agency and sort through what we've learned. Mooring Dock Talk The incident Phoenix: Hey, Larry... I thought you had a book signing? Larry: Yeah, but I snuck off early. I was worried about how your investigation was going! Phoenix: Nobody came to get their book signed, huh? Larry: What kind of a thing is that to say?! Phoenix: Well, how many people showed up, then? Larry: Well, um... Fine! It was four people, if you gotta know! Including the employees... Phoenix: S-Sorry... I shouldn't have asked... Larry: Quit looking at me like I'm some pitiful piglet! Phoenix: Um, why don't you get back to your signing? Another two or three people could show up before the store closes... Larry: They already put away the book signing table and cleaned everything up! I... I don't have anywhere else to go. Phoenix: Gee, Larry... I'm sorry I gave you such a hard time. Larry: I told you to quit looking at me like that! Ellen Phoenix: So, have you been to see Ellen? Larry: Nah. Edgey told me to stay away. He said things always get complicated whenever I'm around. Can you believe the guy? Phoenix: (Actually, I'd tell Larry the exact same thing if I were Edgeworth.) Larry: So... How's the investigation coming along? Phoenix: We've made some progress, but I don't feel like we've gotten to the heart of things yet. Larry: Come on, Nick! You gotta do better than that! Me and Elly's whole future is riding on you! Phoenix: I-I don't think I can take on the heavy responsibility of your future, Larry. Larry: Whaaat? First, Edgey, and now YOU, Nick? Why does everybody gotta be so mean to me? Phoenix: C'mon, Larry! I really don't have time to be standing around shooting the breeze! Why don't you just get back to your book signing, huh? Larry: W-Will you come with me, ol' buddy...? Phoenix: Not a chance! Larry: Ooooooooh...! Phoenix: (Enough is enough already, Larry...) September 22Wright Anything Agency Phoenix: We're back. Anybody here? Athena: Oh, hi, Boss! Phoenix: Athena? I thought you were with Trucy? Athena: Um... I guess you could say that I'm... I-I'm taking a short break! B-But enough about me! What about the investigation! Did you find out anything? Phoenix: Well, turns out that the third person Ellen says she saw at the crime scene... ...might have been Sorin Sprocket. Athena: What? Really? I always thought he seemed suspicious... Phoenix: Thing is, by the time Sorin got to the vista deck... ...the murder had already occurred, apparently. Athena: No way! I don't buy that! Not for a second! It's a cover-up! A cover-up, I tell you! Phoenix: That's... certainly a possibility. And, as a lawyer, it's certainly a possibility I have to pursue, but... Athena: But what? It's your job, right? So pursue the heck out of it! Just do it! Phoenix: Yeah, but... ...is that really what's best for Ellen? Maya: Sorin could be found guilty if the truth comes out tomorrow... But if we don't pursue this possibility, Ellen could be found guilty instead... Athena: Oh, man... Either way, it sure doesn't spell out \"happily ever after\" for the two of them... So what are you gonna do, Mr. Wright?! Phoenix: I can't let an innocent person get convicted. So I guess all I can really do... is pursue the truth. Even if it ends up devastating Ellen... Athena: What a tough call to make... Maya: S-Still, there's always a chance, right? Maybe something will come up during the trial that will save their marriage! Phoenix: I hope so. I really do... ......Well, Maya, let's go. Maya: Break the news to Ellen, you mean...? Phoenix: Yup. Athena: Mr. Wright! Please take me with you! I bet I could help you counsel Ellen through this piece of bad news! Phoenix: Athena... I appreciate the offer, but don't you have somewhere else to be? Athena: ...Do I? Trucy: Athena! What are you doing here?! I've been looking all over for you! Come on, now! Let's get back to practicing! Athena: N-No... Wait...! My body can't take it anymore! B-Boss, you gotta help me! Phoenix: A lawyer always keeps their promises, Athena. Athena: B-But, Boooooss...! Trucy: If you bail on me one more time, Athena, I'm going to use a real blade on you! Athena: Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek! Phoenix: (Sorry, Athena, but somebody's gotta do it... Better you than me, though... Hang in there, kiddo!) Come on, Maya. We'd better get going. September 22Detention Center - Visitor's Room Phoenix: Hello, Ellen. Ellen: How did your investigation go, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Before I answer that, I need to ask you something. Was Sorin with you when Mr. Gloomsbury attacked you in the reception hall? Ellen: I, uh...... I'm sorry I kept it from you. I was afraid that he'd come under suspicion if I told you. So I kept quiet about it. I'm really sorry... Phoenix: ...I see. I thought it was probably something like that. Listen, Ellen... I'm afraid I had to make a very difficult decision based on what I found out... Ellen: ...What kind of decision? Phoenix: This is... very hard for me to say, but... The mysterious person you saw at the scene of the crime... was most likely Sorin. Ellen: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Phoenix: In other words, in court tomorrow... ...I'm afraid I'll have to propose the possibility that Sorin is the true culprit. Ellen: No... Sorin is innocent... Nooo... Phoenix: But don't you see? If I don't try to pursue that line of thought, you'll be found guilty! Ellen: No... Nooooo... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Phoenix: Please, Ellen! Calm down! Ellen: WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Sorin just can't be found guilty! I'd much rather I be found guilty instead! Maya: Ellen! You can't let yourself think like that! Ellen: But..! But...! But...! Nooooooooooooooooooo! Maya: Marriage is for life, right? Do you really think you can run away from the truth and still be truly happy with him? Ellen: WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! You're not married, so how can you possibly understand?! Sometimes you've just got to do whatever it takes to make things wooooork! Maya: But...! N-Nick, you talk to her... Phoenix: H-Hey! Don't just dump this all on me! Ellen: Mr. Wright! I'm innocent, and Sorin is, too! So, please...! Prove our innocence in coooourt! Phoenix: I... I'll certainly do everything in my power... (I just hope she doesn't lose control like this in court tomorrow...) To be continued Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: Nothing particularly interesting here. Area already examined Phoenix: (We've already searched here, but it never hurts to take another look around.) Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I think I'd better take a step back and gather my thoughts a little more...)\n-- Why I Tore Out the Page --Nichody: I rushed to the vista deck, but the crime had already been committed.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait a minute. I thought you went to the vista deck with Mr. Sprocket? Nichody: ...Actually, that is not true. Phoenix: What? What do you mean? Nichody: I found this out afterward, but... ...Master Sorin went to the vista deck alone. He went out the escape hatch in the reception hall, and went along the outside wall. Judge: WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Edgeworth: You can't be serious! You mean, Mr. Wright's addlepated guess was actually correct?! Phoenix: What's with the \"addlepated\"?! Judge: I suppose truth really is stranger than fiction! Phoenix: So, Mr. Nichody... When you got to the scene, you saw Mr. Gloomsbury, Ms. Wyatt... ...and Mr. Sprocket. Is that right? Nichody: That is exactly right.Nichody: I saw Miss Ellen and Gloomsbury collapsed, and Master Sorin writing in his notebook.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So when you and your group arrived at the vista deck... ...the murder had already been committed? Nichody: ...That is correct. Gloomsbury had already been struck. Miss Ellen had lost consciousness, probably from the shock of the incident. Phoenix: ...And how did Mr. Sprocket appear? Nichody: He was bleeding from the stab wound he'd received from Gloomsbury. Barely conscious, he was writing something in his notebook. Phoenix: (So the mysterious third person Ellen saw really was Sorin, then...?)Nichody: Master Sorin said to me, \"I'll take the blame for the murder, so please take care of Ellen.\"Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So Mr. Sprocket wrote a note of confession in order to take the blame for Ms. Wyatt? Nichody: Yes. That notebook is the only form of memory Master Sorin has. So you understand what his action meant, I trust? Phoenix: ............ Maya: Wh-What did it mean, Nick? Phoenix: To Sorin, everything in that notebook is true. So Sorin tried to take the blame... ...by altering his own memory to make himself think he did it. Maya: No... Nichody: Master Sorin truly loves Miss Ellen. It must have been love that made him do that.Nichody: But I went against his order. I tore the page out of his notebook, and hid the body.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Mr. Nichody, could you please tell this court about that in more detail? Nichody: \"That,\" you say? Which part do you mean, Mr. Wright? Could you be more specific? Phoenix: Oh, uh... all right. (What part do I want to know more about?) Hiding the body Phoenix: Please tell me more about the hiding of the body. Nichody: ...Very well. After saying he would take the blame, Master Sorin passed out. That's when I hid the body. I quickly took the lift down to the hold... ...where I hid Gloomsbury's still-warm body in the spare Pegabull lantern. Phoenix: So it was you who hid the body, not the defendant? Nichody: To think Mr. Butz would move the lantern containing the body to the reception hall... Well, I did not see that coming. Phoenix: (I don't blame you. Not even Larry can predict what Larry will do next... Maybe I should take another look at the lantern in evidence...) Judge: Mr. Wright, would you like that statement added to the witness's testimony? Add to testimony Phoenix: Yes, please. Judge: Very well. Please add that statement to your testimony, Mr. Nichody. Adds statement \"In the hold, I hid the still-warm body in the spare Pegabull lantern.\" or changes statement from \"I tore the page out of the notebook in order to protect Master Sorin.\" to \"In the hold, I hid the still-warm body in the spare Pegabull lantern.\" Not necessary Phoenix: No, I guess not, Your Honor. (I'd better be a bit more cautious here.) Judge: No? All right. Very well. Leads back to cross-examination Hiding the body (after adding statement \"In the hold, I hid the still-warm body in the spare Pegabull lantern.\") Phoenix: Please tell me more about the hiding of the body. Nichody: ...Very well. After saying he would take the blame, Master Sorin passed out. That's when I hid the body. I quickly took the lift down to the hold... ...where I hid Gloomsbury's still-warm body in the spare Pegabull lantern. Phoenix: So it was you who hid the body, not the defendant?

Not even Larry can predict what Larry will do next... Maybe I should take another look at the lantern in evidence...) Leads back to cross-examination Tearing out the page Phoenix: Why did you go against Mr. Sprocket's order and tear out the page? Nichody: ...That is a silly question. As I told you before... Disposing of anything that may harm the Sprocket family's reputation... ...is simply a part of my job. Phoenix: Oh, right. You did say that before, didn't you. Nichody: I tore the page out of the notebook in order to protect Master Sorin. Judge: Mr. Wright, would you like that statement added to the witness's testimony? Add to testimony Phoenix: Yes, please. Judge: Very well. Please add that statement to your testimony, Mr. Nichody. Adds statement \"I tore the page out of the notebook in order to protect Master Sorin.\" or changes statement from \"In the hold, I hid the still-warm body in the spare Pegabull lantern.\" to \"I tore the page out of the notebook in order to protect Master Sorin.\" Not necessary Phoenix: No, I guess not, Your Honor. (I'd better be a bit more cautious here.) Judge: No? All right. Very well. Leads back to cross-examination Tearing out the page (after adding statement \"I tore the page out of that notebook in order to protect Master Sorin.\") Phoenix: Why did you go against Mr. Sprocket's order and tear out the page? Nichody: ...That is a silly question. As I told you before... Disposing of anything that may harm the Sprocket family's reputation... ...is simply a part of my job. Phoenix: Oh, right. You did say that before, didn't you. Nichody: I tore the page out of the notebook in order to protect Master Sorin. Leads back to cross-examinationNichody: In the hold, I hid the still-warm body in the spare Pegabull lantern.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why did you hide the body in the lantern? Nichody: As I told you yesterday, it was to make it as though the murder never happened. But thanks to Mr. Butz, things did not turn out as planned. Phoenix: So holding the second wedding reception wasn't Mr. Sprocket's idea... ...but yours, wasn't it? Nichody: It was all for Master Sorin's sake... and Sprocket Aviation. If I am accused of a crime for trying to cover up the incident... ...I shall accept it willingly. Phoenix: (He really doesn't seem to even care about himself!)Present Broken Lantern Phoenix: Leads to: \"(C-Could it be...? Is that what happened...?)\"Nichody: I tore the page out of that notebook in order to protect Master Sorin.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, by tearing the page out of the notebook... ...you erased the memory of Mr. Sprocket, who was trying to take the fall for Ms. Wyatt. Nichody: I knew it went against his wishes... ...but I just could not let Master Sorin bear the blame for something he did not do. As his butler, I believe that was the right decision for me to make. Phoenix: (It was all for Sorin's benefit, huh? I bet Pierce would do just about anything in the name of keeping Sorin's image \"safe\"...)Before adding either statement Phoenix: This testimony of Pierce's... I wonder how much of it we can actually believe. Maya: Yeah. Who knows what parts are true and what parts are more spun tales? Phoenix: Exactly. But we can't just stand around mulling it all over. We have to try and draw information out of him, and see if there are any contradictions!After adding either statement Maya: So he's talking about the cover-up after the incident, huh? Phoenix: Right. That's information only somebody who was actually involved could know. Maya: So it might be a really important piece of testimony! Phoenix: I think so, too. I'll really have to tread carefully here.Phoenix: (C-Could it be...? Is that what happened...? If what I'm thinking is true... ...then maybe I can prove neither Ellen nor Sorin did the deed!) Mr. Nichody, you said the body was still warm when you hid it, correct? So then, what if... ...Mr. Gloomsbury was still alive when you went to put his body inside the lantern...?Nichody: What?!Judge: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!Edgeworth: That's preposterous!Phoenix: Actually, this shows that the victim might have still been alive while inside the lantern!Judge: Hmm... I'm afraid you'll have to point out which part you're talking about, Mr. Wright.Phoenix: This part here shows that the victim might have still been alive inside the lantern!Present valve handle Phoenix: Leads to: \"As you can see, the back end of the lantern is a door.\"Present anywhere else Phoenix: Judge: ...Hmm? Phoenix: Is something the matter, Your Honor? Judge: I'm afraid I don't understand. Phoenix: Well, if you stare at this spot reaaally hard, doesn't it become a little clearer? Judge: Not in the least. Phoenix: ......How about now, Your Honor? Judge: How could I understand without a word of explanation?! Clearly you need to take responsibility for your actions! Phoenix: (I'd better paint a clearer picture next time...) Leads back to: \"This part here shows that the victim might have still been alive inside the lantern!\"Phoenix: As you can see, the back end of the lantern is a door. And there's blood here on the wheel handle!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: That bloodstain must have gotten there when the witness put the body inside the lantern. It, in no way, shows that the victim drew his last breath while he was within the lantern!Phoenix: I disagree, Mr. Edgeworth. For you see, in putting this lantern back together... ...the police inadvertently placed the inside handle on the outside, and vice versa. In other words, the wheel handles got swapped!Judge: Oh, my! So they got swapped?!Phoenix: Yes, they got swapped!Edgeworth: Wh-What? But that's ridiculous!Phoenix: Not at all. If you compare the other male Pegabull lantern in the reception hall... ...it's quite obvious the wheel handles were attached backwards!Edgeworth: Th-The detective in charge of the restoration will see me in my office later!Phoenix: (Sorry, Ema... And good luck.)Judge: I-In that case, what does the bloodstain on the wheel handle mean?Phoenix: The bloodstain didn't get there by chance. When the victim was put inside the lantern, he was only unconscious, not dead. When he regained consciousness, he probably tried to get out of the lantern. So he grasped the inner wheel handle, and that's when the blood got on it! This proves that the victim was still alive when he was inside the lantern!Nichody: At the time, I was completely convinced Gloomsbury was dead. Had I checked more carefully, he might have survived...Edgeworth: Unfortunate, to be sure... but not significant enough to change this trial's outcome.Phoenix: Again, I disagree, Mr. Edgeworth. It actually has a very significant impact on this case.Edgeworth: The victim was struck by the defendant, then died from his injuries some time later. There's nothing more to it!Phoenix:Phoenix: That's where you're wrong! Let's take another look at Mr. Gloomsbury's autopsy report, shall we? Please focus on the description of his injuries. It says, \"One contusion was found on the back of his head, and one on the side.\"Edgeworth: Yes, the one Mr. Sprocket gave him, and the one Ms. Wyatt delivered to finish him off.Phoenix: No, the defense would like to submit a different interpretation.Judge: A different interpretation?Phoenix: The victim was knocked unconscious by the first blow, and was then put into the lantern.Judge: Th-Then, what about the lethal blow by the defendant that the witness talked about?Phoenix: Yes, well... that didn't happen. After some time... ...when the victim regained consciousness and tried to get out of the lantern... ...that's when he received the second blow that finished him off!Judge: Taking into account the fact that the victim was alive for a period after the first hit... ...and that he did receive a second blow to the head... It does seem entirely possible!Phoenix: Yes. As long as the first blow didn't kill the victim instantly... ...then there's a possibility that... ...someone other than Mr. Sprocket or Ms. Wyatt delivered the fatal blow!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: Hmph. That's all you've got? Even if there was a time lag between the two blows... ...the prosecution's position doesn't change.Phoenix: What? What do you mean?Edgeworth: It's elementary, Mr. Wright. After the reception, when the defendant was cleaning up the reception hall... ...the victim, who was supposed to be dead, suddenly came out of the lantern. The defendant grabbed the murder weapon, which was right there, and finished him off.Judge: Hmm... That theory sounds awfully familiar...Edgeworth: Of course it does, Your Honor, because it's exactly what I proposed at the very start. The second blow was inflicted by the defendant after all!Judge: I-I see! It seems a tangle of mysteries has unraveled into a single thread!Phoenix:Phoenix: But as long as there's a possibility that the fatal blow was delivered by a third person... ...then we must continue the deliberations!Edgeworth: Give it up, Mr. Wright! Unless you have something to prove the presence of your precious \"third person\"?!Phoenix: I, uh...!Maya: Okay, Nick! Just relax! You can do this! Come on, now. Take some deep breaths!Phoenix: Good idea. Deep breaths... Deep breaths...Maya: There! Don't you feel better already?Phoenix: (Maya's right. I should calm down, get my focus back, and go over everything again. And then, hopefully, I'll be able to find something to prove there was a third person!) ...Let's see. First, why did Gloomsbury attack Ellen?Maya: Because... he was tired of taking the blame for the accident?Phoenix: Hmm... But something about that line of reasoning just doesn't feel quite right to me...Maya: No? How come?Phoenix: Well, if it's just a personal vendetta, he had already stabbed Sorin. So why, then, was he so determined to go after Ellen?Maya: You're right. This whole thing feels too premeditated for a crime of passion...Phoenix: But Gloomsbury didn't seem to have a personal grudge against Ellen... (If Gloomsbury didn't have a personal reason to attack Ellen, then...)Edgeworth: You've taken long enough, Mr. Wright. Now it's time for some action. What proof do you have that a third person was involved?!Phoenix: All right. I'll show you. (I'm not completely sure of what I'm doing yet, but it looks like I'm out of time!) This piece of evidence proves the involvement of a third person!Present Gloomsbury's Note Phoenix: Leads to: \"I get it now...\"Present anything else Phoenix: Judge: Hmm... And how does that prove the involvement of a third person, Mr. Wright? Edgeworth: I would love to hear the defense explain its way out of this. Maya: Go ahead, Nick! Tell 'em! Phoenix: Well, you see... Um... Huh? It looks like... I was wrong. Judge: Next time, try to involve your brain before you blurt out an answer! Maya: Not one word! Just look over the evidence again, all right?! Phoenix: Y-Yes, ma'am... (I'd better try that again.) Leads back to: \"This piece of evidence proves the involvement of a third person!\"Phoenix: (I get it now... Now I see why this note bothered me so much when I first saw it.)Phoenix: It looks like a note outlining the murder plot...Ema: That note was apparently written by the victim.Phoenix: But why would he feel the need to write instructions to himself like this?Phoenix: Your Honor, please take a look at this note.Judge: This is... the victim's murder plan, right?Phoenix: It's definitely \"a\" murder plan, but what if... ...Mr. Gloomsbury didn't write this note himself?Judge: Wh-What?Edgeworth: THIS is how you intend to conjure up your mysterious third party, Mr. Wright? Can you even prove that that note wasn't written by the victim?Phoenix: ...Yes. Yes, I can.Judge: ...Very well, then. Please present your evidence, Mr. Wright.Phoenix: This evidence proves the victim didn't write the note.Present Candelabra Phoenix: Leads to: \"This is the weapon Mr. Gloomsbury used to stab Mr. Sprocket.\"Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This is the proof you've been dying to see! Edgeworth: It doesn't look like anything of the sort to me. Judge: ...I have to agree. Phoenix: Just close your eyes and concentrate, Your Honor. Is something coming to you? Judge: ............No, nothing at all. Phoenix: ...Nothing, huh? Judge: Mr. Wright. Close your eyes and concentrate. Do you see something coming to you? Phoenix: (I should've seen that coming... Looks like I'd better try again.) Leads back to: \"This evidence proves the victim didn't write the note.\"Phoenix: This is the weapon Mr. Gloomsbury used to stab Mr. Sprocket.Edgeworth: I was wondering what you'd pull out this time. Dare I ask what that could possibly have to do with the note?Phoenix: Mr. Gloomsbury's prints were found on this candelabra. And the prints were from his left hand.Judge: So, that makes the victim left-handed, correct?Phoenix: Exactly, Your Honor. The police looked into it, too, and confirmed as much. Now, take a look at the smudged writing in this note. Notice how the smudging only starts from the middle of each proceeding line. Had this been written by a lefty, the writing would be smudged from the far left end. This means that whoever wrote this note was definitely right-handed. In other words, somebody other than the victim wrote this note!Judge: What?! Hmm... But if someone other than Mr. Gloomsbury wrote it, then what does this note mean?Phoenix: Mr. Gloomsbury followed this note to the letter when he attacked Ms. Wyatt. So, clearly, this note isn't a murder plan written by Mr. Gloomsbury, but rather... ...these are instructions to kill Ms. Wyatt, issued by somebody else!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: If it wasn't the victim who wrote these so-called \"instructions\"... ...then who wrote it? Most of the people involved are right-handed, you know.Nichody: He is correct. The majority of the family and their employees who were on the airship... ...are indeed right-handed. I must say, that is a very rough and slipshod conjecture you've proposed.Phoenix: Nnngh! (I admit I haven't figured out who wrote it just yet...)Maya: Leave it to Mr. Edgeworth to go for the jugular...!Phoenix: (This culprit who ordered Gloomsbury to attack Ellen... ...what could their motive have been?)Maya: It doesn't seem very likely Ellen did anything to incur anybody's wrath, right?Phoenix: Right... (Not too likely, anyway...) In that case, it has to be about Sorin.Maya: If somebody were to hold a grudge against Sorin, what would it be about?Phoenix: ...That accident, I'd guess. I could understand if Gloomsbury felt resentful about having to take the blame.Maya: But the one who lost the most to that accident was Sorin's sister... She lost her life, after all. Sorin suffered, too, of course. He was crushed by losing somebody so precious to him.Phoenix: \"Somebody precious,\" huh... \"Sorin's sister\"... Wait! There's one more person! There's someone else who must hold a grudge against Sorin!Maya: Did you figure something out?Phoenix: I think so... I think this \"somebody else\" used Gloomsbury to try and get revenge against Sorin.Judge: Did you say somebody tried to get revenge against Mr. Sprocket, Mr. Wright?Phoenix: The person who manipulated and used Mr. Gloomsbury was...Sorin's father Phoenix: ...Mr. Sprocket's father. I heard that the marriage to Ms. Wyatt didn't have the family's blessing. Sorin's father must have used Mr. Gloomsbury to try and stop their union. Edgeworth: Edgeworth: Hmph. Your thoughts are all over the place, Mr. Wright. Do you really think the president of Sprocket Aviation, a man of great influence... ...would try to murder someone in order to stop a wedding? Phoenix: Umm... Edgeworth: If he just wanted to stop the marriage, there were a multitude of other, better ways. Phoenix: (H-He's got a good point, there...) Judge: Mr. Edgeworth is right. It doesn't sound very plausible. And it's irresponsible to throw suspicion around without good reason, defense. Phoenix: (Then who could've been manipulating Gloomsbury...?) Leads back to: \"The person who manipulated and used Mr. Gloomsbury was...\"The family elder Phoenix: ...the family elder! Judge: The family elder...? Has this \"family elder\" person come up in the deliberations before? Phoenix: N-No, not really, Your Honor. But don't rich families like the Sprockets usually have somebody like that? Judge: Mr. Wright, you can't just make up people whenever you want! Heck, even I only get to hand out penalties when necessary. Phoenix: (D-Does that mean he'd penalize me more if he could...?) Leads back to: \"The person who manipulated and used Mr. Gloomsbury was...\"Selena's fianc\u00e9 Leads to: \"The person who used Mr. Gloomsbury to try and get revenge on Mr. Sprocket...\"Phoenix: The person who used Mr. Gloomsbury to try and get revenge on Mr. Sprocket... ...and then finished Mr. Gloomsbury off to silence him... ...was a man dear to Mr. Sprocket's older sister: Selena Sprocket's fianc\u00e9! (Not that I'm positive, but it's certainly possible... This fianc\u00e9 could have made Gloomsbury attack Ellen to get his revenge on Sorin.)Edgeworth: Wh-What...?Judge: Her fianc\u00e9?! Order in the court! Order, I say! Yes, it does seem quite believable that Ms. Selena Sprocket's fianc\u00e9... ...would bear a grudge against Mr. Sprocket for his role in the accident.Phoenix: Exactly, Your Honor. Maybe her fianc\u00e9 was trying to murder Ms. Wyatt... ...in order to make Mr. Sprocket experience the same pain he'd felt.Edgeworth:Edgeworth: Ms. Sprocket's fianc\u00e9... was a surgeon, if memory serves. But the only people who attended the reception were family and staff members.Phoenix: That may be, but then that just means that Ms. Sprocket's fianc\u00e9 must have been... ...among those who attended!Maya: What?! Really?!Phoenix: Of course. Otherwise, how could he have killed Gloomsbury?Maya: Oh... I see what you're doing... This is just another giant bluff, isn't it?Edgeworth: All right. I'll bite. Who exactly do you claim this fianc\u00e9 to be?Judge: Yes! I would like to know as well!Maya: A-Are you sure you're gonna be okay, Nick?Phoenix: M-Maybe...? (When it comes to suspicious people, there's only one person on my list... I need to find something that connects him to Selena...)

Phoenix: ...Yes, I believe it will. At least, I hope it will, anyway...! Judge: I'd like you to show me another piece of evidence, Mr. Wright. Evidence that you're taking this job seriously!

Haven't we seen it somewhere before?Judge: Hmm, yes. Now that you mention it, I do feel as if I've seen it somewhere before...Nichody: ............Phoenix: I believe we've all seen it... right here in this very courtroom!Edgeworth: Augh! I-Impossible...!Phoenix: That's right. The pocket watch in this photo... ...is the same pocket watch Mr. Nichody has on him right now!Judge: WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!Phoenix: This is clear proof... ...of a strong connection between Pierce Nichody and Selena Sprocket!Edgeworth: No...!Judge: Hmm... Well, Mr. Nichody? Is this true?Nichody: ............Phoenix: Mr. Nichody... You were once engaged to Selena Sprocket. That pocket watch... You keep it as a memento of her, don't you?Nichody: ............Phoenix: Mr. Nichody, you planned to rob Mr. Sprocket of his loved one... ...to make him feel the same pain as you. Isn't that right?Nichody: ............Phoenix: But Mr. Sprocket managed to fight back, and knocked Mr. Gloomsbury unconscious. You thought Mr. Gloomsbury was dead, and hid his body in the lantern.Nichody: ............Phoenix: But then you noticed Mr. Gloomsbury regain consciousness... ...and so you finished him off to prevent your plan from being exposed. This is the defense's take on what really happened in this murder case.Judge: Mr. Wright, does this mean... ...you wish to officially accuse this witness of the murder of Dumas Gloomsbury?!Phoenix: Does the defense accuse Mr. Nichody of the murder...?Accuse Leads to: \"The defense indicts Pierce Nichody on the charge of murdering Dumas Gloomsbury!\"Don't accuse Phoenix: (Wait. If I back down now, it's all over. I have to take the plunge and chase this down to the very end!)

M-Mr. Nichody, would you care to respond?Nichody: ............ Man, this lawyer just yaps on and on and on... As you guessed, this watch is a memento of Selena. It stopped working at the time of the accident, though...Phoenix: ...Then, you really are...!Nichody: ......Yes, I was Selena's fianc\u00e9. And not just her fianc\u00e9... ...but the surgeon beside her deathbed.Edgeworth:Edgeworth: Mr. Nichody! Why didn't you tell me any of this before?!Nichody: Shut it, you useless prosecutor. I thought you could be of use, but apparently, this case was too much for you.Edgeworth: What did you say?!Nichody: If your office hadn't stuck its nose all up in this, I could've swept it under the rug. Not only did you interfere with the case, but you even let me fall under suspicion!Edgeworth: That's because you kept trying to cover things up on the sly!Nichody: Urrgh!Phoenix: But covering things up wasn't your only involvement. The only person who had a motive to use the victim to try and kill Ms. Wyatt... ...was you!Nichody: N-Nngrrrrrrrr! Malignant tumors... There are malignant tumors in this courtroom, lesions oozing with false charges! The tumors are one idiotic lawyer, and one useless prosecutor! After the truth is revealed, I'll have the both of you incised from the legal world!Edgeworth: Hmph. I'd like to see you try.Nichody: With the power of the Sprocket family, it'd be a cinch. I will now begin the operation!Maya: Wh-What in the world happened to Mr. Nichody...?Phoenix: Looks like he's finally showing his true colors.Maya: Nick! Look what he did to that shoulder mech!Nichody: Quit your yapping, before I suture your chatty lips shut.Maya: It's like he's a completely different person...Phoenix: Sure looks like it, huh. We can't let our guards down now! Mr. Nichody, it's finally time for you to testify... ...to the truth!Judge: ...It seems we're entering the final act at last.

I will answer, but I have no intention of making any voluntary statements of my own.Phoenix: Ngh...Maya: What's he trying to do, Nick?Phoenix: He's using the silent treatment as his strategy to avoid getting tripped up. Clever guy...Edgeworth: No more lies, Mr. Nichody. You will tell us nothing but the truth from now on! Augh! Wh-What do you think you're doing?!Nichody: No one asked you to speak. Just keep quiet over there and play with your frills.Edgeworth: H-How dare you!Judge: Well!

    "cot": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other based on the given information. The characters, evidence, and testimonies are all provided. Let's go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the testimonies from Pierce Nichody. The relevant ones are:\n\nTestimony 1: \"Gloomsbury was my right hand man. I'd suffer the most from losing him.\"\nTestimony 3: \"I've never thought of exacting revenge on Master Sorin.\"\nTestimony 5: \"I was always in the company of others. I didn't have the opportunity to murder Gloomsbury.\"\n\nNow, the evidence includes several items. The key here is to find a piece of evidence that directly contradicts one of these statements.\n\nLooking at the evidence list, Evidence 17 (Candelabra) mentions that it has traces of blood matching the lift's bloodstain, and it has Gloomsbury's fingerprints from his left hand. But how does that relate to the testimonies?\n\nWait, Evidence 7 (Gloomsbury's Note) is a note found near the victim. The description says the writing is smudged as if written by a right-handed person. However, we know from the Candelabra (Evidence 17) that Gloomsbury was left-handed. So if the note was written by someone right-handed, but Gloomsbury was left-handed, this suggests that Gloomsbury didn't write the note. Therefore, someone else (Nichody) wrote the note, implying that Nichody had a motive to frame or use Gloomsbury, which contradicts his testimony that he never thought of exacting revenge on Sorin (Testimony 3). Because if Nichody wrote the note, he was planning to use Gloomsbury to attack Ellen, which would be part of his revenge plan against Sorin.\n\nSo the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (Nichody claiming no revenge thoughts) and Evidence 7 (Gloomsbury's Note showing someone else wrote it, indicating Nichody's plan for revenge). But wait, Testimony 3 is about revenge, and Evidence 7's note being written by a right-hander (Nichody) would indicate that he orchestrated the attack, thus contradicting his claim of no revenge.\n\nTherefore, the correct pair is Evidence 7 (Gloomsbury's Note) contradicting Testimony 3 (never thought of revenge)."

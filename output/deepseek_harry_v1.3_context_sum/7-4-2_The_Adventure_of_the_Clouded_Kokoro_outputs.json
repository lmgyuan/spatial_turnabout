    "response": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. Let me go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the testimonies. All the testimonies are from Gregson (Testimony 0 to 6). He mentions that the incident happened at 5 PM with light fog, good visibility, only the victim and accused present. The accused (Soseki Natsume) ran off, scattering belongings including old books he just bought from Bourbon Books. The police used the books to find and arrest him.\n\nNow, looking at the evidence. Let's check each one to see if there's a contradiction with any of Gregson's statements. \n\nEvidence 3 is a receipt from a secondhand bookshop found in Natsume's room. Gregson's Testimony 5 says Natsume was coming from Bourbon Books, which matches the receipt. So that's consistent.\n\nEvidence 8 is \"The Fourth Book\" found in the victim's hand, titled 'The Lion's Pride'. The back cover is burnt. Testimony 6 says they worked out who the books belonged to and arrested him. But according to Testimony 3 and 4, Natsume dropped his books when he ran. However, if the victim was holding a book, that book wouldn't be among the ones Natsume dropped. So the presence of the book in the victim's hand contradicts the testimony that all the books scattered were Natsume's. The receipt (Evidence 3) lists the books Natsume bought, but if 'The Lion's Pride' wasn't among them, then the book in the victim's hand isn't his. This would mean Gregson's claim that they identified him via the books is flawed because one book wasn't his, contradicting Testimony 6.\n\nAnother angle: Evidence 8's book was in the victim's hand when Mrs. Beate arrived. If the victim had it, then it wasn't part of the scattered books from Natsume. Therefore, the police might have incorrectly linked all books to Natsume, but this one wasn't his. The receipt would show which books he bought, and if 'The Lion's Pride' isn't on the receipt, that's a contradiction. But I need to check Evidence 3's description. Evidence 3 is a receipt for \"some books\" from the secondhand shop. If The Lion's Pride isn't listed there, then that's a contradiction. But the receipt's description doesn't specify which books, so maybe the fact that the book was burnt (possibly indicating it's from another source) contradicts the idea that all books were Natsume's. So Testimony 6 says they found the owner via the books, but if one book wasn't his, then that's a contradiction. Therefore, Evidence 8 (The Fourth Book) contradicts Testimony 6 because the book in the victim's hand isn't Natsume's, making the arrest based on incorrect evidence.\n\n{\"evidence\": 8, \"testimony\": 6}",

    "response": "Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let's start by going through the testimonies and evidences one by one.\n\nFirst, looking at Testimony 4 by Patricia: She claims that the defendant, Soseki Natsume, was the one they saw at the scene. But maybe there's evidence that contradicts this. Let's check the evidences.\n\nEvidence 3 is a receipt from a secondhand bookshop found in Natsume's room. If he bought books, maybe that's related. Then Testimony 5 says Patricia can name the four books he dropped. However, Evidence 8 is a book called 'The Lion's Pride' found in the victim's hand. Wait, the receipt in Evidence 3 might list the books he bought. If the receipt shows four books, but the victim has a fifth book (The Lion's Pride), that would contradict Patricia's Testimony 5, which says he dropped four books. But the receipt is for \"some books\" but doesn't specify the number. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the fourth book is part of the ones he bought. Wait, the receipt is from before the incident. If the receipt lists four books, and the victim was holding one of them, but Patricia says he dropped four, maybe that's a discrepancy. Or maybe the fourth book is different. Wait, the victim's book (Evidence 8) has a burnt back cover. If the receipt in Evidence 3 is for four books, but the crime scene has a fifth book (The Lion's Pride), that would mean that Natsume didn't drop all the books, hence contradicting Patricia's Testimony 5 where she claims he dropped four. Wait, but the receipt is for \"some books\"\u2014maybe the exact number isn't specified. Alternatively, maybe the victim's book wasn't among those Natsume purchased. If Patricia says he dropped four books, but the victim was holding a fifth, that could be a contradiction. However, the evidence says that The Lion's Pride was discovered in the victim's hand, so maybe that's the key. If the defendant's books were four, but the victim's book is a fifth one, then Patricia's Testimony 5 (naming four books he dropped) would conflict because the fifth book at the scene wasn't his. But how does the evidence show that? The receipt (Evidence 3) is for books purchased by Natsume. If the receipt lists specific titles, but The Lion's Pride isn't among them, then the presence of that book at the scene would contradict Patricia's assertion that the books he dropped are the four from the receipt. Wait, but the receipt's description just says \"some books\", so maybe without specific titles, it's hard to link. Alternatively, perhaps the number of books is the issue. If Patricia says he dropped four books (Testimony 5), but the crime scene has one book in the victim's hand (Evidence 8), plus maybe others? But the evidence doesn't mention other books. Wait, in the evidence list, Evidence 8 is the only book mentioned. So if Patricia claims he dropped four books, but only one is found at the scene, that's a contradiction. However, maybe the receipt (Evidence 3) shows that Natsume bought four books, and the victim's book is one of them. So if the victim's book is part of the four, then there's no contradiction. Alternatively, if the receipt is for four books, but the victim has a fifth, then Patricia's testimony about the four books would be wrong. But the problem is that the receipt's description doesn't state the number of books. Wait, looking back: Evidence 3 is \"some books that he had purchased from a secondhand bookshop before the incident occurred.\" So \"some\" could be any number. Testimony 5 says Patricia can name the four books he dropped. So if she's claiming he dropped four, but the receipt shows he bought, say, four, then that's consistent. But Evidence 8 is a fifth book, which wasn't among those he bought. Wait, but maybe The Lion's Pride is one of the four. Alternatively, if the receipt lists four books, but The Lion's Pride isn't among them, then the presence of that book in the victim's hand would mean that the defendant didn't drop it, contradicting Patricia's Testimony 5. However, without the receipt's specific contents, perhaps this is not directly conflicting. Let's consider another angle. Evidence 8 states that the book was in the victim's hand when Mrs. Beate first ran over. But Patricia's Testimony 2 says that the other person (the defendant) scattered something before running off. So she's implying that the defendant scattered the items, including the books. But if the book was in the victim's hand, not scattered, that might be a contradiction. Or maybe the book was part of the scattered items, but the victim grabbed it. Hmm. Alternatively, let's look at Testimony 4 where Patricia says they saw the defendant. But maybe there's evidence that the defendant couldn't have been there. For example, Evidence 12 is a fragment of metal in Mr. Garrideb's pipe, which is the tip of a knife blade. If the knife used in the crime (Evidence 5) is missing a tip, and Evidence 12 matches that, then maybe the real culprit is connected to the Garridebs. But how does that contradict a testimony? Alternatively, maybe the pipe (Evidence 11) broke during a domestic dispute, which could imply that the Garridebs were arguing, and perhaps involved in the crime. But that's more of a connection than a contradiction. Let's consider another testimony. Testimony 3 says they went to a nearby police box for help. But Evidence 4 mentions that the crime scene is just outside Constable Beate's beat. The Case File (Evidence 4) says the pavement where the victim was found is just outside Constable Beate's beat, the border of which is Briar Road. However, the Warrant Card (Evidence 9) identifies the bobbies and their conduct. If the Beates were outside their beat, maybe they shouldn't have been there, but Testimony 0 says they were out for their anniversary. But that's not a direct contradiction. Let me think again. Patricia's Testimony 4 claims they saw the defendant. But if there's evidence that the defendant was elsewhere, but the main evidence here is the receipt (Evidence 3) showing he bought books. Maybe the timeline. If the receipt is from before the incident, maybe it's not directly related. Wait, the receipt was found in Natsume's room, proving he bought books. If the books at the scene are the ones he bought, then Patricia's Testimony 5 (naming the four books) would align. However, if the book in the victim's hand (Evidence 8) isn't one of those four, then her testimony would be wrong. But how do we know? The problem is that the receipt's description doesn't specify the titles. Unless the receipt in Evidence 3 lists four books, and the book in Evidence 8 is a fifth one. But without explicit titles, maybe that's hard. Alternatively, maybe the receipt's date and time could conflict with the incident's timing. For example, if Natsume bought the books after the incident, but the receipt was found in his room. But the description says he bought them before the incident. So that's not it. Wait, Evidence 8's updated description mentions that the back cover is badly burnt, which can be noticed by examining it. If the burnt corner wasn't mentioned in court, but the book's presence in the victim's hand is, perhaps the burnt part indicates something. Maybe the book was burned, which could suggest it was from a fire, but how does that contradict a testimony? Let's go back. The key contradiction might be between Testimony 5, where Patricia says she can name the four books the defendant dropped, and Evidence 8, which is a fifth book found in the victim's hand. If the defendant only had four books (as per the receipt), but the victim is holding a fifth, then Patricia's testimony about the four books would be incorrect. But how do we know the receipt is for four books? The description of Evidence 3 just says \"some books\"\u2014maybe four. Wait, Testimony 5 says Patricia can name the four books he dropped. If the victim's book is one of those four, then maybe not. But if the victim's book isn't part of the four, then it's a contradiction. However, without knowing the titles on the receipt, how can we confirm? Alternatively, the receipt (Evidence 3) might be for three books, and the fourth is the one in the victim's hand, but that's speculative. Maybe another angle: The Case File (Evidence 4) says the victim was found with a knife in her back, and the crime scene photo (Evidence 6) shows the knife. The Jackknife (Evidence 5) is the weapon. The Fragment of Metal (Evidence 12) is a tip stuck in the pipe. If the knife used in the crime had a broken tip, which matches Evidence 12, then the real knife used was broken, and perhaps the Jackknife (Evidence 5) is missing its tip. If so, the knife used was the same as the fragment in the pipe, which connects to Mr. Garrideb's pipe (Evidence 11). This would imply that the Garridebs are involved, contradicting the testimonies that point to Natsume. But how does this directly contradict a testimony? Patricia's Testimony 4 says they saw Natsume, but if the real culprit was someone else (like Garrideb), then her testimony is contradicted by the evidence of the knife fragment. But the question is which specific evidence and testimony contradict each other. So perhaps the contradiction is between Patricia's Testimony 4 (saw Natsume) and Evidence 12 (fragment from Garrideb's pipe). But how does Evidence 12 directly contradict her testimony? Maybe the knife used was broken, and the fragment links to Garrideb, suggesting the real culprit is connected to him, thus contradicting Patricia's identification of Natsume. But that's a bit indirect. Alternatively, the pipe (Evidence 11) broke during a domestic dispute. If the fragment (Evidence 12) is from the knife used in the crime, then the knife was broken during the dispute, meaning the attacker was at the Garrideb residence, not Natsume. Therefore, Patricia's Testimony 4 (saw Natsume) would be contradicted by Evidence 12, which suggests the knife came from Garrideb's pipe. But I'm not sure if that's a direct contradiction. Let's think again. Another possible contradiction: Testimony 2 says the defendant scattered something before running off. But Evidence 8 states that the book was found in the victim's hand. If the defendant scattered items, the victim wouldn't be holding one of them. Therefore, the presence of the book in the victim's hand contradicts Testimony 2, which says the defendant scattered things. But that's a possible angle. Alternatively, Testimony 2 says the other person (defendant) scattered something, but the book was in the victim's hand, implying the victim had it before being attacked, not scattered by the defendant. So the contradiction could be between Testimony 2 (scattered by defendant) and Evidence 8 (victim holding it). But is that a solid contradiction? If the victim was holding the book when attacked, then the defendant couldn't have scattered it. So Patricia's Testimony 2 claims the defendant scattered items, but the book was in the victim's hand, not scattered. Therefore, the act of scattering (throwing items) vs the victim holding the book. Therefore, Evidence 8 (book in victim's hand) contradicts Testimony 2 (defendant scattered items). But Testimony 2 is from Patricia. Let me check the exact wording of Testimony 2: \"All of a sudden, one of them just collapsed on the floor. Then the other scattered something before running off!\" So after one person (victim) collapsed, the other (defendant) scattered something. But the book was in the victim's hand when Mrs. Beate first ran over (Evidence 8's description). So if the defendant scattered items after the victim collapsed, but the book was in the victim's hand, then the book couldn't have been scattered by the defendant. Therefore, the book must have been in the victim's possession before collapsing, meaning the defendant didn't scatter it. Hence, Evidence 8 contradicts Testimony 2. So the pair would be Evidence 8 and Testimony 2. Let's check the JSON: {\"evidence\": 8, \"testimony\": 2}. Is that correct? Yes. The testimony says the defendant scattered something, but the evidence shows the book was in the victim's hand, not scattered. Therefore, contradiction.\n\n{\"evidence\": 8, \"testimony\": 2}",

    "response": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. I need to look through each testimony and see if any of the evidences directly contradict what's being said.\n\nFirst, let's list out the testimonies and the evidences. The key here is to find a direct contradiction. \n\nLooking at Testimony 3 from Patricia: \"I did leave the scene to go and fetch help, but my trusty Roly was there to make sure nothing was disturbed.\" So she's saying she left to get help, and Roly stayed to keep the scene undisturbed. But Roly's Testimony 6 says: \"I didn't take my eye off the crime scene for one moment, sah! Nothing strange to report on that front, sah!\" So Roly claims he was watching the scene the whole time. Wait, but Patricia left and Roly stayed. So if he was watching, maybe there's a contradiction with some evidence.\n\nNow looking at the evidence. Evidence 10 is the Anniversary Bouquet, which Patricia dropped when she saw the victim. The description says she dropped the rose where she stood. But according to Testimony 5 from Patricia: \"What happened was, I dropped my bouquet and ended up losing my way for a while.\" So she dropped the bouquet, which is the evidence, and then got lost. However, if she was supposed to have left to get help, but lost her way, maybe there's a time discrepancy here. But how does that contradict the testimony?\n\nWait, let's check Testimony 2 from Patricia: \"Obviously, if anything had been thrown out of the window, we would have seen it.\" The Garrideb house windows are top-hinged. The evidence related to that could be the pipe (Evidence 11) and the fragment of metal (Evidence 12). The broken pipe might have been thrown out the window. But Patricia and Roly's testimonies say they didn't see anything thrown out. But if there's evidence that something was thrown out, like the pipe, which broke and had a metal fragment (maybe part of a knife), then their testimony would be contradicted. \n\nWait, the fragment of metal (Evidence 12) is stuck in the pipe's bowl, which broke. The pipe (Evidence 11) fell during a domestic dispute. So perhaps the pipe was thrown out of the window, which would mean something was thrown out, but Patricia and Roly say they didn't see anything. So if the pipe was thrown out, their Testimony 2 (\"if anything had been thrown out... we would have seen it\") is contradicted. But how does the evidence show that something was thrown out? The pipe was found in the house, maybe? Or was it thrown out and then picked up? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Testimony 6 from Roly: he says he didn't take his eye off the scene. But if Patricia left to get help, and Roly stayed, but Evidence 10 (the bouquet) was dropped by Patricia when she saw the victim. If Patricia was at the scene, dropped the bouquet, then left to get help, but Roly claims he was watching the scene the whole time. But the bouquet being there might indicate that Patricia was present at the scene when the incident happened, which she was. But how does that contradict? Maybe not.\n\nWait, another angle. The Fourth Book (Evidence 8) was in the victim's hand. The receipt in Natsume's room (Evidence 3) shows he bought books. Maybe the book in the victim's hand was his, connecting him to the crime. But not directly contradicting a testimony.\n\nThe crime scene photographs (6 and 7) show the knife and the victim's hand. The knife (Evidence 5) is common, but the fragment of metal in the pipe (Evidence 12) could be from the knife. If the pipe was broken with the metal fragment, and the knife used in the crime had a broken tip, that would link the Garridebs to the knife. But how does that connect to testimonies?\n\nBack to Testimony 2: Patricia says nothing was thrown out of the window. But if the pipe was thrown out, then their testimony is wrong. But the pipe (Evidence 11) is Mr. Garrideb's, and it fell during a domestic dispute. If the pipe was thrown out the window, then the Beates should have seen it. But the pipe was found in the house, maybe, so perhaps it wasn't thrown out. Wait, the testimony says that if anything was thrown out, they would have seen it. The evidence about the pipe's location isn't clear. If the pipe was inside the house, then their testimony isn't contradicted. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Testimony 3: Patricia says she left to get help and Roly stayed. Roly's Testimony 6 says he didn't take his eye off the scene. But Evidence 2 is Iris's Postcard, which is a message to Inspector Gregson. How does that relate? Maybe the postcard's content could indicate something about the timeline or the scene, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, Evidence 2 is a postcard from Iris to Gregson. The description says it's a message on the back. If the postcard's message mentions something about the scene being disturbed or about the timeline, maybe that contradicts Patricia's Testimony 3 where she says Roly ensured nothing was disturbed. But if the postcard suggests that something was disturbed while Patricia was away, that would be a contradiction. But without knowing the exact message on the postcard, it's hard to say. Wait, maybe the postcard's message is a clue. For example, if Iris's message says something about the crime scene being altered after Patricia left, then Testimony 3's claim that Roly kept the scene undisturbed would be contradicted. But since the user hasn't provided the exact content of the postcard, perhaps the key is in the existence of the postcard. Maybe the postcard was sent to Gregson, indicating that Iris had information that the scene was disturbed, but Patricia says Roly was there to prevent that. Hmm, this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at Testimony 6 from Roly: he says he didn't take his eye off the scene. But if there's evidence that something was disturbed or an item was moved, that would contradict. For example, the bouquet (Evidence 10) was dropped by Patricia, but if she left and the bouquet was picked up or moved, that would indicate the scene was disturbed. But Patricia's Testimony 3 says Roly made sure nothing was disturbed, but if the bouquet was moved, that contradicts. But the description of Evidence 10 says she dropped the rose where she stood, so maybe it remained there. Not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: The Fourth Book (Evidence 8) was in the victim's hand when Mrs. Beate first ran over. But the receipt (Evidence 3) in Natsume's room shows he bought books. If the book in the victim's hand is one of those, that connects Natsume to the victim. But how does that contradict testimony?\n\nAlternatively, the Local Map (Evidence 1) shows the victim was found just outside Constable Beate's beat. The Case File (Evidence 4) mentions the border of his beat is Briar Road. If Patricia and Roly were outside their beat, perhaps they shouldn't have been there, but their testimonies don't mention that. But that's not a direct contradiction.\n\nWait, let's go back to Testimony 2 and 3. Patricia says they would have seen anything thrown out of the window. The pipe (Evidence 11) broke during a domestic dispute. The fragment of metal (Evidence 12) in the pipe's bowl could be part of the knife. If the knife was broken, and the fragment came from the pipe, perhaps the knife was broken when the pipe was thrown or dropped. If the pipe was thrown out the window, then Testimony 2 is contradicted because they didn't see it. But if the pipe was inside the house, then no. The evidence says the pipe fell during a domestic dispute. So maybe it was inside, so no contradiction. Hmm.\n\nWait, the Secondhand Book Receipt (Evidence 3) is for books bought by Natsume. The Fourth Book (Evidence 8) is in the victim's hand and has a burnt cover. If the receipt includes \"The Lion's Pride\", that would connect Natsume to the book, but the receipt is from a secondhand shop, so maybe the victim obtained the book from there. But how does this contradict testimony? Not directly.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Testimony 3 and Evidence 2. Testimony 3 says Patricia left to get help, and Roly stayed. Evidence 2 is a postcard to Gregson from Iris. If the postcard's message indicates that Gregson wasn't contacted properly, or that the scene was disturbed, maybe that contradicts. But without knowing the message, it's hard. However, perhaps the key is that Patricia left to get help, but according to the postcard (Evidence 2), maybe the help wasn't summoned properly, indicating that Roly wasn't there. For example, if the postcard is a message that Gregson received later, implying that Patricia didn't actually get help, contradicting her testimony that she left to get help. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (Patricia says she left to get help and Roly stayed) and Testimony 6 (Roly says he didn't take his eye off the scene). But if Patricia left, and Roly was watching, maybe there's a contradiction if evidence shows the scene was disturbed. But I need to connect it to evidence.\n\nWait, the Crime Scene Photographs (6 and 7) show the knife and the victim's hand with the book. If, for example, the book wasn't there when Roly was watching, but appeared later, that would contradict. But the book was there when Mrs. Beate first ran over, according to Evidence 8. So perhaps not.\n\nWait, let's consider the pipe (Evidence 11) and the fragment (Evidence 12). The pipe broke, and the fragment is part of a knife. If the knife used in the crime had a broken tip, matching the fragment, then the knife came from the Garrideb household. If the Garridebs threw the knife out the window, then Patricia and Roly's Testimony 2 says they would have seen anything thrown out. But the knife was found in the victim's back. So if the knife was thrown from the window, they should have seen it, but they didn't. That would contradict Testimony 2. But the knife was found at the scene, so how was it thrown? Maybe the Garridebs threw the knife after the attack, but the Beates didn't see it. That would mean their Testimony 2 is contradicted by the presence of the knife from the window. But how does the evidence connect?\n\nAlternatively, the broken pipe has a fragment of the knife. If the knife was broken during the domestic dispute, and part of it ended up in the pipe, then the knife used in the crime is from the Garridebs. If the knife was thrown out the window, but the Beates didn't see it, contradicting their Testimony 2, then Evidence 12 (fragment) and Evidence 5 (knife) would show that the knife came from the house, thus Testimony 2 is contradicted. But I'm not sure which evidence directly contradicts which testimony.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Testimony 0 from Roly: \"This case has nothing to do with Mr and Mrs Garrideb. Believe me, a London bobby is good for his word!\" But if the evidence (like the pipe and fragment) connects the Garridebs to the crime, then Testimony 0 is contradicted. So Evidence 11 or 12 would contradict Testimony 0. But the user asks for one pair. So maybe Evidence 12 (fragment of metal) contradicts Testimony 0 (Roly says case has nothing to do with Garridebs). But the fragment in the Garrideb's pipe links them, so this would show the case does involve them, contradicting Roly's Testimony 0. So that would be Evidence 12 and Testimony 0. But the user might expect a different pair.\n\nAlternatively, the key contradiction is between Testimony 2 (Patricia says they would have seen anything thrown out) and Evidence 11 (pipe broken during domestic dispute). If the pipe was thrown out, but they didn't see it, then contradiction. But the pipe's evidence says it fell during a domestic dispute. Maybe it was thrown out, but they didn't see it. So Evidence 11 contradicts Testimony 2. But the pipe's location is not clear. If it was found inside the house, then it wasn't thrown out, so no contradiction. If it was found outside, then they should have seen it. But the evidence description says the pipe fell to the floor during a domestic dispute. So it was inside, thus not thrown out. Therefore, Testimony 2 isn't contradicted here.\n\nWait, maybe the answer is Evidence 2 (Iris's Postcard) and Testimony 3 (Patricia says she left to get help). If the postcard's message indicates that Gregson wasn't informed, or that help wasn't summoned, that would contradict Patricia's testimony. For example, if the postcard shows that Iris was the one who contacted Gregson, not Patricia, then Patricia's claim that she went to get help would be false. So Evidence 2 (Iris's Postcard to Gregson) would mean that Iris contacted Gregson, implying Patricia didn't actually get help, thus contradicting her Testimony 3. That seems plausible. So the contradiction would be between Evidence 2 and Testimony 3. That's possible. Because if Patricia says she left to get help (Testimony 3), but the postcard (Evidence 2) shows that Gregson was contacted by Iris instead, then Patricia's testimony is a lie. Therefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 2 and Testimony 3.\n\n{\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}",

The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "response": "Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let me start by going through each testimony and evidence one by one.\n\nFirst, looking at the testimonies. Testimony 0 from Garrideb says he and his wife had a skirmish that day. Testimony 1, also Garrideb, mentions knocking over a candlestick, starting a fire, then opening the window. Testimony 2 is Joan saying she was throwing things. Testimony 3 is Garrideb again, saying there are plenty of knives and he wouldn't notice if some went missing. Testimony 4, Garrideb again, challenges proving the knife is theirs.\n\nNow the evidences. Evidence 11 is Garrideb's pipe that broke during a dispute. Evidence 12 is a metal fragment in the pipe bowl, possibly a knife tip. \n\nTestimony 3 says knives are common and he wouldn't notice missing. But Evidence 12 shows a knife fragment in the pipe from the dispute. If a knife broke during the fight (as per the pipe fragment), then that knife was missing, but Garrideb claims he wouldn't notice. But the fragment suggests a knife was used and broken, which might be the one used in the crime. So there's a contradiction between Testimony 3 (saying he wouldn't notice missing knives) and Evidence 12 (showing a broken knife part from their home). Alternatively, maybe the pipe's broken part comes from the knife used, so if the knife was broken during the fight, it's missing, but Garrideb's testimony says he wouldn't notice. So the presence of the fragment contradicts his claim that he wouldn't know if a knife went missing. Therefore, Evidence 12 (fragment) contradicts Testimony 3 (Garrideb's statement about not noticing missing knives). But wait, the evidence is the fragment, which is part of the knife, so if the fragment is from their knife, then the knife was broken and part of it remained in the pipe. Therefore, the knife was used in the skirmish and left a fragment. But Garrideb says he wouldn't notice a missing knife, but if the knife broke during the fight, maybe he should have noticed. However, Testimony 3 is about the knife going missing, not breaking. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 4: Garrideb says if the knife in the victim is theirs, proving it would be hard. But the fragment in the pipe (Evidence 12) could link the knife to their home. So if the murder weapon is from their home, and the fragment matches, then Testimony 4's claim that proving it is hard is contradicted by Evidence 12. But the question is which testimony and evidence directly contradict.\n\nAnother angle: Testimony 3 (plenty of knives, wouldn't notice missing) vs Evidence 12 (metal fragment from a knife in the pipe). If the knife was broken during the fight, then a piece is left in the pipe. But Testimony 3 says he wouldn't notice a missing knife. However, the broken knife would have a piece missing, which could be noticed. But perhaps the fragment is from the same knife used in the crime, which was taken from Garrideb's home. So the existence of the fragment in their home suggests that a knife was broken there, but Garrideb claims he wouldn't notice if one went missing. But the fragment is part of the knife, so maybe the knife was broken and left, so it's not missing but broken. That might not directly contradict. Alternatively, the murder weapon (Jackknife, Evidence 5) could be the same as the knife from Garrideb's home. But how does that connect?\n\nWait, Evidence 5 is the Jackknife found in the victim. If that knife is from Garrideb's home, then Testimony 3 says he wouldn't notice if it's missing, but perhaps there's evidence linking the knife to their home. The fragment in the pipe (Evidence 12) could be part of the same knife. So if the fragment matches the knife used in the crime, that shows it's from Garrideb's home. Therefore, Testimony 4 where Garrideb says proving it is their knife would be hard is contradicted by Evidence 12, which provides a link. So maybe Evidence 12 and Testimony 4. But the answer needs to be one pair.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 4: Garrideb says proving the knife is theirs would be hard. But Evidence 12 (the fragment) is a piece of the knife in their pipe, which can be matched to the murder weapon. So if the fragment is part of the murder weapon, then it's evidence linking the knife to them, contradicting Testimony 4. That makes sense. So Evidence 12 and Testimony 4.\n\nBut let me check the numbering. Evidence 12 is the fragment of metal in the pipe. Testimony 4 is Garrideb's statement about having a hard time proving the knife is theirs. So the presence of the fragment in their home (from the pipe) would allow matching to the knife, thus contradicting Testimony 4. So the correct pair is Evidence 12 and Testimony 4. \n\nBut wait, the answer must be one pair. Let me verify again.\n\nTestimony 3: Plenty of knives, wouldn't notice missing. Evidence 12: Fragment of a knife in the pipe. If during the fight, a knife broke and left a fragment, then that specific knife is missing a piece. But Testimony 3 says he wouldn't notice if a knife went missing. However, the broken knife might still be present but damaged. So perhaps the contradiction is not there. Alternatively, the fragment shows that a knife from their home was broken, which could be the same as the murder weapon. So the murder weapon (Jackknife, Evidence5) might have a broken tip, matching the fragment (Evidence12). Thus, the fragment in the pipe (Evidence12) links the murder weapon to the Garrideb household, contradicting Testimony4 where Garrideb says proving the knife is theirs would be hard. So Evidence12 and Testimony4.\n\nYes, that seems correct. The fragment found in the pipe (Evidence12) could be used to prove that the knife came from their home, which contradicts Testimony4's assertion that proving it would be hard.\n\n{\"evidence\": 12, \"testimony\": 4}",

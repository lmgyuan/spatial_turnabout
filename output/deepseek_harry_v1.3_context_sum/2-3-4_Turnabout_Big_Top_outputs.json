    "response": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So, the user is asking which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The characters involved here are Acro, who's an acrobat with a lower body injury. The testimonies from Acro say that he could lift the bust because of his upper body strength, but couldn't look out the window to know where the victim's head was, making it impossible to drop the bust accurately.\n\nLooking at the evidence, let's see. There's the Crime Photo (Evidence 2) which shows the victim lying face down on a box with footprints leading there. The autopsy report (11) says the cause was blunt force to the back of the head, which would require knowing where the head was. But Acro claims he couldn't see the head's position from the window. However, there's another piece: the Scarf (Evidence 19) which is Bat's scarf stained with blood and pepper. The pepper connects to the seasoning bottle (13) in the wooden box (12), which the victim was over. Maybe the pepper on the scarf suggests that Bat (Sean Dingling) was involved, but he's in a coma. Wait, but how does this tie to Acro's testimony?\n\nWait, the key contradiction might be about the knowledge of the head's location. Acro says he couldn't look out the window to know where the head was, so he couldn't have aimed. But if there's evidence showing that the victim's head was positioned in a way that didn't require looking out the window, that would contradict. Alternatively, maybe the position of the wooden box and the footprints. The Crime Photo shows the footprints leading to where the victim is. If Acro left the bust from above, maybe the footprints could indicate where the head was. Wait, but the photo is just the scene, not sure.\n\nWait, looking at the testimony. Acro's testimony 4 says he couldn't know the location of the head, so he couldn't have dropped the bust. But the evidence might show that he didn't need to look out the window to know where the head was. Let's check the Circus Map (6). Acro is on the third floor of the lodging house. The Ringmaster's room is northeast. If the crime scene is the lodging house plaza, maybe the bust was dropped from above. But if Acro was on the third floor, maybe he could see directly down without looking out the window. Or perhaps the position of the window is such that he couldn't see, but there's another way.\n\nWait, looking at Evidence 15: Max G. Bust. It's a bronze statue taken from the cafeteria before the crime. If the bust was heavy, but Acro could lift it. Then, if he was on the third floor, maybe he dropped it from his room's window. But he claims he couldn't look out the window to see where the head was. However, maybe the victim's position was such that the head was under the window, so he didn't need to look. But the Crime Photo shows the victim lying on the box in the snow with footprints leading there. If the footprints were leading directly below Acro's window, then he could have known the position without looking. But the testimony says he couldn't look out the window, so how would he know the head's position? Unless the footprints show exactly where the head was, so he didn't need to look. Wait, but the photo's caption says there are footprints leading to where the victim is. So if Acro set up the meeting via the note (Evidence 16) in Regina's pocket, he could have directed the victim to a specific spot where he knew the victim would be. So even without looking out the window, he could have anticipated the victim's position. That would contradict his testimony that he couldn't know the head's location because he couldn't look out. The note (Evidence 16) says \"Meet at 10:00 PM tonight at the lodging house plaza.\" If Acro placed the note, he knew the victim would be at that specific location, so he could have positioned the bust to drop exactly there without needing to look. Therefore, his testimony 4 (which claims he couldn't know the head's location) is contradicted by the note (Evidence 16), which he himself placed to lure the victim to a specific spot. Therefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 16 (the note) and Testimony 4 (Acro's claim he couldn't know the head's location because he couldn't look out the window). Because he set the meeting place, he knew where the victim would be, so he didn't need to look out the window to know the head's position. So the answer would be Evidence 16 and Testimony 4.\n\n{\"evidence\": 16, \"testimony\": 4}",

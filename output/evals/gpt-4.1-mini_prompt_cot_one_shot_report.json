April May's testimonies 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 all relate to her eyewitness account of a physical attack using \"The Thinker\" clock as a weapon\u2014this aligns with the autopsy report.\n\nHowever, Evidence 1 describes \"The Thinker\" as a clock/statue with its gears removed, suggesting it might not have the integrity to be used as a lethal blunt force weapon in the way described. But that's not a strong contradiction; it's merely context.\n\nNo direct contradiction is apparent between the autopsy and April's testimony on this point.\n\nNext, reviewing the Bellboy's Affidavit (Evidence 12) and April's testimonies might find contradictions, but the Bellboy's Affidavit only describes a man who stayed with Miss May. There is no benched testimony regarding this.\n\nLooking at Testimony 9 (Maya's Memo) and others, no immediate contradictions stand out.\n\nConsidering the timing: Mia died at 9:00 PM; but no testimony contradicts this.\n\nApril says she saw Maya commit the murder (Character description). That aligns with her testimonies.\n\nTherefore, maybe the contradiction is in the Bellboy's Affidavit vs. April's testimony.\n\nBellboy Affidavit (E12) states that a man stayed with Miss May on the night of the murder. April (Testimony 0-4) claims she saw Maya commit the murder, meaning Maya was involved at the scene.\n\nIf the Bellboy's Affidavit suggests Maya was with a man elsewhere at the time, that would contradict April's claim.\n\nSo if the Bellboy's Affidavit says Maya was not at the crime scene when the murder happened, but April says she saw Maya commit the murder, they contradict.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Evidence 12: Bellboy's Affidavit saying Maya was with a man at the hotel on the night of the murder.\n\n- Testimony 0-4: April May states she saw Maya commit the murder.\n\nHence, the pair is Evidence 12 and Testimony 0.\n"

Evidence 3 states that Jack Hammer died at 2:30 PM due to being pierced in the chest by a spear. Meanwhile, Evidence 11 mentions that Mr. Monkey's Head blocked the path to the scene of the crime between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM.\n\nIf the path to the crime scene was blocked between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM, Powers dragging one leg at 2:00 PM near the studios may not be consistent with Powers being able to reach the crime scene at or before 2:30 PM to commit the crime, assuming he was the murderer.\n\nThe testimonies, however, especially Cody's testimonies (Testimony 0 to 5), do not speak on Powers' physical condition or movement time, and instead focus on his camera and the timing of photos.\n\nNone of the testimonies mention Powers' condition or that he was at the gate at 2:00 PM.\n\nGiven that, the direct contradiction is between Evidence 11 and Evidence 5 rather than evidence and testimonies.\n\nNow, looking at testimonies, Testimony 5 (Cody) says \"I took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em,\" but Evidence 15 (Cody's Camera) says Cody always carries his camera but he's still learning how to use it. This suggests Cody may not be reliable in erasing photos.\n\nBut no direct contradiction between evidence and testimony is obvious there.\n\nSince testimonies 0-5 are all from Cody about camera photos. Evidence 5 is a photo taken at 2:00 PM showing Powers dragging one leg, which contradicts the testimony 5 (Cody) that says he erased photos because it was too late.\n\nIf Cody erased the photos, Evidence 5 (photo of Powers dragging one leg) can't exist, which means Testimony 5 and Evidence 5 contradict each other.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 5 and Testimony 5.\n"

Evidence 20 (Autopsy Report) estimates the time of death between 3 AM and 6 AM on the 27th. This suggests the victim died before the 7 AM roll call, but his body was not found during roll call.\n\nTestimony 2 (Elbird) says: \"Just as I'd counted to two, I heard a voice shout out, 'AAARGH! I've been stabbed!'\" This suggests Elbird heard the stabbing happening.\n\nHowever, Testimony 4 (Elbird) says \"I couldn't do anything since I was locked up in my cell. So, I went back to my training.\" This indicates he was locked up, and presumably couldn't move from his cell at the time of the stabbing.\n\nEvidence 7 (Door Sensor) states that doors detect the prisoners' bracelets and raise the alarm if inmates are near, and prisoners are not allowed to move about freely.\n\nCombining these: if Elbird was locked in his cell during the stabbing and couldn't do anything, he should not have been able to hear the shouting (depending on the cell layout and soundproofing), or he should have been able to raise alarm or assist. But the key contradiction is that he says he heard the stabbing while counting to two (which implies being at or near the scene), but also says he was locked in his cell (implying a distance or unable to witness).\n\nAlternatively, looking for a more direct contradiction:\n\nEvidence 13 (Wiped Floor) states that blood was wiped from the floor in Knight's cell and confirmed as Knight's.\n\nTestimony 4 (Elbird) says he was locked in his cell and just went back to training, implying no disturbance.\n\nHowever, if bloody floor was wiped, some disturbance or efforts to clean up happened.\n\nBut this is indirect and a stretch.\n\nLooking further:\n\nEvidence 10 (Sahwit's Bracelet) says the bracelet was broken and undetected by sensors.\n\nTestimony 0 (Elbird) says recreation time ended at 10 AM.\n\nEvidence 15 (Security Camera Footage) says the victim was attacked around 9 AM, but footage has a 3-hour time gap.\n\nIf Sahwit's bracelet was broken and undetected, yet prisoners can't move freely, contradiction about presence.\n\nBut no testimony explicitly contradicts these.\n\nGoing back to testimonies 2 and 4:\n\nTestimony 2 (Elbird) says he heard a voice shout, presumably the stabbing occurred.\n\nTestimony 4 (Elbird) says he was locked up and went back to training, implying he did not help or respond.\n\nThis shows a contradiction in the witness' behavior and statements.\n\nAlternatively, examine testimonies 2 and 3:\n\nTestimony 2: \"Just as I'd counted to two, I heard a voice shout out, 'AAARGH! I've been stabbed!'\"\n\nTestimony 3: \"It sounded like someone in pain, calling out for help. But...\"\n\nSuggesting hesitation or doubt.\n\nBut not a direct contradiction with evidence.\n\nNow, consider that the evidence says the time of death was between 3 AM and 6 AM (Evidence 20).\n\nBut Testimony 0 says recreation ended around 10 AM.\n\nTestimony 2 says the stabbing was heard while counting to two, no exact time given.\n\nIf death was between 3-6 AM, but recreation ended at 10 AM, and presumably prisoners locked in at night, it's unlikely anyone heard a stabbing at 9 or 10 AM.\n\nTherefore, Testimony 2 contradicts Evidence 20.\n\nThat is, Elbird claims to have heard the stabbing voices at recreation time (post 7 AM), but autopsy says death between 3 and 6 AM.\n\nHence, these contradict.\n\nTherefore, evidence 20 (autopsy, time of death 3-6 AM) contradicts testimony 2 (hearing stabbing shout at around recreation time, presumably after 7 AM).\n\nHence, the pair is Evidence 20 and Testimony 2.\n"

A man... not moving... dead!\" by Sahwit\n\nTestimony 0-4 are all from Sahwit.\n\nSahwit's testimony does not mention a dog attack, but Evidence 9 says \"Sahwit claims to have seen this dog biting the victim's throat.\"\n\nTherefore, Sahwit's testimony seems to contradict the autopsy (Evidence 20).\n\nSo the contradiction is between Evidence 20 and Testimony 3 (where Sahwit claims to have seen the dead body, but in Evidence 9 he says he saw a dog biting the throat).\n\nHence, the contradiction is between:\n\nEvidence 20 (Autopsy report \u2014 cause of death stab wound to neck) and\n\nTestimony 3 (Sahwit's claim of witnessing the crime scene with dog bite implication).\n\nTherefore:\n"

However, considering the timeline, if the victim was alive at 3 AM exactly, then the death sometime between 3 AM and 6 AM is still possible, but if the testimony implies after 3 AM the victim was back in the cell, probably alive, then the exact time of death closer to 3:00 AM is questionable.\n\nMore importantly, Evidence 8 (Prison Roll Call) says the body was not found at 7 AM roll call, implying the body was discovered after 7 AM.\n\nNo clear contradiction there.\n\nNow, look at Evidence 9 (Black Dog): Sahwit claims to have seen a black dog biting the victim's throat.\n\nTestimony 5 (Laguarde states): \"Kanis was the one I hated. And he had no connection with the victim.\"\n\nIf Kanis is the owner of the black dog, then Sahwit's account implicates Kanis, which Laguarde contradicts.\n\nHowever, this is not a direct contradiction between testimony and evidence.\n\nLooking for contradictions with testimonies by Laguarde, who says the victim was brought to her office around 3 AM and went straight back to his cell.\n\nLook at Evidence 15 (Security Camera Footage) that shows a time gap around 9 AM, and footage shows the victim being attacked then.\n\nThis conflicts with Evidence 20 indicating time of death between 3 and 6 AM.\n\nSo security footage shows attack around 9 AM, but autopsy says death was between 3 and 6 AM.\n\nTherefore, Evidence 15 (Security Camera Footage) contradicts Evidence 20 (Autopsy Report) on time of death.\n\nBut question asks for one pair of evidence and testimony that contradict.\n\nIs there a testimony about the time of death from witnesses?\n\nNo explicit testimony on time of death.\n\nTherefore, let's compare testimonies with this evidence.\n\nTestimony 1 says victim was with Laguarde at 3 AM.\n\nBut if death happened between 3 and 6 AM, it is possible Laguarde saw the victim at 3 AM and victim died shortly after.\n\nNo real contradiction there.\n\nTestimony 5 by Laguarde denies Kanis's connection with the victim.\n\nEvidence shows Kanis hiding the chisel (Evidence 21) in his dog\u2019s mouth, tying him to the murder weapon.\n\nThus, testimony 5 contradicts evidence 21.\n\nTherefore, the strongest contradiction between evidence and testimony is:\n\nEvidence 21: Chisel with blood found hidden by Kanis.\n\nTestimony 5: Laguarde claims Kanis had no connection with the victim.\n\nHence, evidence 21 contradicts testimony 5.\n"

Testimony 1 from Badd states that Master made sure to leave the door to his own room unlocked, suggesting access to the room was possible. However, Testimony 0 states that if the body had been found in a locked room, Master would have been the prime suspect. \n\nConsidering all of this, the contradiction lies primarily in the implication about the room's locked status. Testimony 1 says the door was left unlocked, ensuring no suspicion on Master. Testimony 0 says if the door was locked, Master would be prime suspect. If the door was locked and the body was inside, but the Master is not suspected, then these contradict.\n\nBut both testimonies 0 and 1 could be both true (explaining the situation). Let's look for a stronger contradiction.\n\nTestimony 2 says the Master broke the lid on the treasure chest to ensure the body would be seen. Evidence 2 notes the chest was crushed by a ship post, and the body was half covered by a blue sheet. The blue sheet is identified as the Luminous Cloth, Evidence 23. So the body was covered, yet testimony says the Master wanted the body to be seen by breaking the lid.\n\nTherefore, testimony 2 (Master broke the lid to ensure the body would be seen) contradicts the evidence indicating the body was covered by a blue cloth (Evidence 2 and 23). This is a direct contradiction.\n\nHence, the pair is Evidence 2 and Testimony 2.\n"

It also states that the chest wounds were inflicted post-mortem.\n\nHowever, Evidence 16, describing the Ringleader's Appearance, mentions the Ringleader wore a magenta flower, which matches the description of the Magenta Flower in Evidence 6 torn from the victim's clothes, indicating a violent struggle.\n\nTestimonies 0 through 4 by Gravelle discuss a letter and a partnership with Ms. Crane but do not directly address the cause of death or the injuries.\n\nReviewing the evidences and testimonies, the key contradiction lies between:\n\n- Evidence 11 stating the chest wounds were inflicted post-mortem.\n- The implication from other evidence and the circumstances of the case that the chest wounds caused death or were significant in the murder.\n\nHence, the contradiction lies between the Autopsy Report (Evidence 11) and the implication or assertion in the general understanding from other evidences or testimonies that the chest wounds caused death.\n\nGiven the testimonies do not explicitly state the cause of death, no direct testimony contradicts the autopsy report clearly.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Evidence 22, the Red Raincoat, worn by the victim and associated with fingerprints and blood on the hood, and the Nurse Niedler's Statement (Testimony 23), which is about how she swapped places with Rosie Ringer, may provide a contradiction.\n\nIf Nurse Niedler claims she swapped places with Rosie Ringer, but the victim's items (Red Raincoat, Blood) link such identity to the victim, there may be a contradiction.\n\nHowever, since the Nurse Niedler's Statement is Evidence 23, not a testimony, and there is no matching testimony contradicting it explicitly, this might not fit.\n\nSince all Gravelle's testimonies relate to Ms. Crane and a letter, perhaps matching with Evidence 13, the Victim's Letter from Kay, but there is no explicit contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the best explicit contradiction is between:\n\nEvidence 11: Autopsy Report says chest wounds were post mortem.\n\nAnd\n\nEvidence 9: Candelabrum, considered the murder weapon judging by wounds to the chest, implying chest wounds were fatal and before death.\n\nTestimony does not contradict these evidences directly.\n\nHence, focusing on contradictions between evidence and testimony, the only testimony that can be considered contradictory is:\n\nTestimony 4: \"Her parting gift is this letter, which she tucked safely away in her left breast pocket,\" by Gravelle.\n\nThis contradicts Evidence 13: Victim's Letter.\n\nIf the letter is found with the victim, but testimony says it was tucked safely away by Ms. Crane, implying it was retained by her and not with the victim, it's a contradiction.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Evidence: 13, Victim's Letter (found with the victim)\n\n- Testimony: 4, Gravelle claims the letter was safely away with Ms. Crane\n\nThis is a contradiction.\n"

So we look further.\n\nEvidence 4 (Movie Set Locks) mentions a chain cut on the side gate sometime last night, indicating possible unauthorized access.\n\nEvidence 11 (Ms. Hart's Statement) says Ms. Hart was in the 51st-floor storeroom the night before last and didn't see the president pass through.\n\nTaking together, the biggest contradiction is between Testimony 2\u2019s claim that there was no one else on the rooftop aside from the president and Judge Gav\u00e8lle, and Evidence 10's note that there's no camera footage of the president leaving the roof, while other evidence indicates possible unauthorized access.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction lies in Testimony 2 (claiming exclusivity of presence on the roof) and Evidence 4 (sign of forced entry via side gate).\n\nHowever, a stronger direct contradiction is between Testimony 2 (Lang's claim that no one else was on the roof), and Evidence 10 (which implies there is no footage of the president leaving, i.e., someone else might have been there).\n\nSince the question asks for one pair, the clearest contradiction is between:\n\nEvidence 10: \"There's no footage of the president riding the elevator down to leave.\"\n\nTestimony 2: \"At the time, there was no one else on the rooftop, aside from those two.\"\n\nIf there was no other person, the president should have escaped or left.

            "reasoning": "Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies. Evidence 10 (Security Camera Footage) states that President Wang and Judge Gav\u00e8lle are seen arriving on the roof of the Bigg Building, but there is no footage of the president riding the elevator down to leave. Testimony 1 from Lang says, \"That woman, she came back down on the elevator alone,\" indicating that the woman went down the elevator by herself while the president did not.\n\nThen Testimony 2 says: \"After that, there was no sign of the president getting on the elevator at all!\" which aligns with the evidence. Testimony 3 asks rhetorically if there is any other way for the president to come down, which suggests the elevator is the only way.\n\nTestimony 4 suggests the president was pushed off the roof by that woman, but the evidence does not show or support him leaving the roof via the elevator or any other way. However, the contradiction is subtle.\n\nLooking for contradictions between testimony and evidence:\n\nEvidence 9 (Behind-the-Scenes Photo) shows that no monster footprints and no body were visible yesterday, but Evidence 6 (Monster Footprints) claims the concrete was broken and earth exposed after Excelsius Winner dug up the president's corpse.\n\nBut no testimony mentions these footprints or the corpse being dug up.\n\nAnother possible contradiction could be between Ms. Hart's statement (Evidence 11) who \"was in the 51st-floor storeroom the night before last, but didn't see the president pass through,\" and Testimony 0 or Lang's testimony referring to the photo taken 10-20 minutes after the president went up to the roof.\n\nBut these could coexist (she didn't see him pass through the storeroom, but photo shows president and judge on roof).\n\nLooking at the testimonies by Lang: Testimony 0 says a photo was recorded 10-20 minutes after the president went up to the roof with that woman - this is supported by Evidence 9 (Behind-the-Scenes Photo). Testimony 1 states \"That woman, she came back down on the elevator alone\", but Evidence 10 says the footage shows no footage of president leaving by elevator. These two agree.\n\nTestimonies 3 and 4 suggest the only way down was the elevator or being pushed off the roof.\n\nNone of those testaments contradict the evidence strongly.\n\nLet's look at Evidence 27: Mr. Aldown's Photograph: \"Shows the president being kidnapped. Only one picture was taken. Touch the Check Button for details. Staged photograph taken after Aldown was killed.\"\n\nThis states the photograph was staged and taken after Aldown was killed.\n\nIf any testimony claimed the photograph shows a real kidnapping, that would be contradiction.\n\nBut no testimony mentions this photograph explicitly.\n\nLooking at Evidence 18 (Bug): \"The person in the red raincoat planted this inside Kay's Yatagarasu pin.\" This contradicts Kay Faraday's own character as a thief wearing the pin\u2014 if the pin was bugged, and testimony 0 or 1 claim she was communicating normally.\n\nBut no given testimonies for Kay or about the bug.\n\nTherefore, the only direct contradiction is between Evidence 10 and Testimony 4.\n\nEvidence 10 says: no footage of president taking elevator down; Testimony 4 says: \"Besides getting pushed off the roof by that woman\", implying the president was pushed off the roof.\n\nIf the president was pushed off the roof, the question is if the evidence (no sign of falling body) contradicts this? No explicit mention.\n\nAlternatively, consider Testimony 1 and 2 by Lang: She goes down alone, president no sign on elevator, implying she left alone, president did not leave by elevator.\n\nTestimony 3 says: \"There's no other way for the president to get down without using the elevator, is there?\" which is in question.\n\nBut the evidence includes side gate chain was cut last night (Evidence 4), that may provide an alternative exit.\n\nTherefore, Testimony 3 is contradicted by Evidence 4 which shows a side gate chain was cut, possibly allowing an alternative way down.\n\nHence the contradiction:\n\nTestimony 3 states: \"There's no other way for the president to get down without using the elevator, is there?\"\n\nEvidence 4 says: \"The combination lock on the front gate was left untouched, while the side gate's chain was cut sometime last night.\"\n\nCut side gate suggests an alternative exit.\n\nTherefore, testimony 3 is contradicted by evidence 4.\n"

The urn was \"Broken by Pearl right before the murder,\" and was \"Under repair in the hallway until police came.\"\n\nTestimony 16 (Pearl's Ball) indicates Pearl was playing with this at the time of the murder.\n\nIf Pearl broke the Sacred Urn right before the murder, but the urn was under repair in the hallway until police came, and Pearl was playing with her ball at that time, then this suggests contradictory timing regarding Pearl's actions.\n\nHowever, there are no testimonies directly addressing Pearl breaking the urn or the timing of her playing.\n\nLooking at Evidence 4 (Folding Screen) and Evidence 17 (Clothing Box), both mention bullet holes about 8 inches off the ground.\n\nThis may contradict the autopsy report about being shot in the forehead at point-blank, which would indicate a higher bullet hole. But there's no testimony explicitly stating the bullet hole's location.\n\nTherefore, the main contradiction arises between the testimonies and the murder weapons.\n\nThe fact that the knife and pistol both bear Maya's fingerprints, but the testimony is that Maya was the attacker and killer, but the evidence shows two shots were fired, and the knife was used to stab.\n\nHowever, the testimony 3 (Gumshoe) states \"The defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back.\"\n\nIf the victim was stabbed and shot, it is possible he was trying to defend himself, or at least the nature of being attacked with both weapons means he was fighting back or incapacitated.\n\nAlternatively, looking for a clearer contradiction:\n\nEvidence 11 (Maya's Costume) mentions a bullet hole present in the sleeve, but the robe is otherwise clean, suggesting the bullet hole is from the victim shooting Maya, but Gumshoe's testimony claims Maya was the attacker.\n\nMeaning, the evidence that Maya's costume has a bullet hole (suggesting she was shot), contradicting the testimony that Maya was the attacker and killing a victim not fighting back.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 11 (Maya's Costume) and Testimony 3 (Gumshoe's statement about Maya attacking and killing an unresisting person).\n\nHence:\n"

            "reasoning": "Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies carefully.\n\n- Evidence 3: Silk Hat found at the crime scene.\n- Evidence 4: Max G. Promo Poster with Max's three famous symbols: a silk hat, cloak, and white roses.\n- Testimonies 0 to 4 by Moe all describe Max's symbols and presence: shadow, symbols, silk hat, cloak.\n\nHowever, the contradictory statement might come from the testimony mentioning seeing Max clearly, but evidence relating to the cloak being fluttering and unclear or silhouette.\n\nBut Testimony 4 states: \"His cloak was fluttering in the wind, so I couldn't really see what he was carrying,\" which contradicts Moe's other testimonies (0,1,2,3) where he claims to have clearly seen Max's items and face.\n\nThe contradictions are within the testimonies, not between evidence and testimony.\n\nLooking at another angle:\n\n- Evidence 11: Russell's Autopsy Report states the time of death: 10:15 PM, cause: blunt force trauma to the back of the head.\n\n- Evidence 16: Note posted in the cafeteria, torn, says \"Meet at 10:00 PM tonight at the lodging house plaza.\"\n\n- Testimonies from Moe say Max was seen at some time, but no specific time frame contradicting the time of death.\n\nIs there a conflict between Evidence 7 (Broken Bottle) and any testimony? No direct mention.\n\nThe one strong contradiction is in the testimonies by Moe:\n\n- Testimony 0 says: \"I was a bit far away, but that shadow could only have belonged to Max.\"\n\n- Testimony 3 says: \"His face was silhouetted, but there was no doubt that it was him.\"\n\n- Testimony 4 says: \"His cloak was fluttering in the wind, so I couldn't really see what he was carrying.\"\n\nTestimonies 0 and 3 claim certainty in identifying Max; testimonial 4 admits uncertainty.\n\nStill, this is among testimonies, not with evidence.\n\nLooking back at evidence:\n\n- Evidence 19: Bat's scarf stained with his blood and a small quantity of pepper.\n\n- Evidence 13: Small Seasoning Bottle found inside the wooden box contains pepper.\n\nBut there's no testimony mentioning pepper.\n\nNow, I'll consider the silk hat (Evidence 3) and Max's symbols (Evidence 4). Moe testifies seeing the silk hat and cloak clearly (Testimonies 1 and 2), but also states uncertainty about what Max was carrying (Testimony 4).\n\nThis may be internal contradiction but not with evidence.\n\nAnother route: Evidence 11 says blunt force trauma to the back of the head as cause of death, but does any testimony say something conflicting?\n\nNo testimony directly mentions cause or manner.\n\nHence, the best contradiction is within testimonies, which is not acceptable.\n\nBack to evidence and testimonies.\n\nEvidence 19 is interesting: scarf stained with blood and pepper.\n\nNo testimony mentions pepper or scarf.\n\nEvidence 16 states the note found in Regina's pocket to meet at 10 PM.\n\nNo testimony contradicts that.\n\nConclusion:\n\nTestimonies about Max's vision contradict each other (certainty versus uncertainty), but no clear contradiction with evidence.\n\nTherefore, the only concrete contradiction is:\n\n- Moe's conflicting testimonies: Testimony 3 (clear face silhouette) versus Testimony 4 (unable to see what Max was carrying).\n\nThis is a contradiction between testimonies, but the question asks for contradictions between evidence and testimony.\n\nLooking at Evidence 11 (Russell's Autopsy Report) and Testimony 0 by Moe (\"I was a bit far away, but that shadow could only have belonged to Max.\"), if Max was clearly there at the crime scene and the cause of death was blunt trauma to the back of the head, the question is whether Max had the opportunity.\n\nTestimonies suggest Max was seen at some distance; presence of silk hat confirms. So no contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the strongest contradiction is:\n\n- Evidence 3 (Silk hat found at the crime scene) means Max was there.\n\n- Testimony 4 (Moe): \"His cloak was fluttering in the wind, so I couldn't really see what he was carrying.\"\n\nThis last testimony contradicts the presence of the silk hat (evidence 3) because if the cloak fluttered making it hard to see what Max was carrying, how could Moe be sure the silk hat was present? Because the hat is distinct from the cloak.\n\nSo, Testimony 4 says uncertainty of Max's carrying items, but the evidence shows silk hat found.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 3 (silk hat found at the scene) and Testimony 4 (uncertainty about what Max was carrying).\n"

Evidence 15 is the knife bearing victim's blood and Engarde's fingerprints.\n\nGumshoe Testimony 5 states: \"The defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!\", which assumes the defendant Matt Engarde committed the murder.\n\nHowever, Testimony 2 and 3 and Evidence 16 mention the Jammin' Ninja's button was found in Engarde's hakama, implying the rival (Jammin' Ninja) was at the scene, which could mean someone else was involved.\n\nGumshoe's assertion that the defendant bought the knife conflicts with the fact that the knife was bought at the Gatewater Hotel (Evidence 15), which might be inconsistent with Engarde\u2019s known whereabouts or purchases. Nonetheless, this is not explicitly contradictory.\n\nAnother point of contradiction is between Evidence 8 and Evidence 9's description: Evidence 8 says the wine glass with tomato juice bears Andrews' fingerprints and is found next to the victim. Evidence 9 states the victim sits with a glass of juice behind him on the dresser, and a full bottle of juice on the desk in front. The glass is behind the victim on the dresser, while the full bottle is in front on the desk, but the glass is described as being found next to the victim in Evidence 8 \u2014 a slight discrepancy but probably not a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, consider Testimony 4 and 5: Gumshoe says \"The defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife\" and \"The defendant bought the knife for the crime\", implying premeditation. But Evidence 15 says the knife grip is engraved with \"Gatewater\" - possibly indicating it belonged to the hotel. If the knife belongs to the hotel (gatewater engraving), it was likely not bought by Engarde personally. Therefore, the testimony claiming Engarde bought the knife may contradict the evidence that the knife was a Hotel's property.\n\nTherefore, these two contradict.\n"

Particularly, Powers insists the bellboy came out empty-handed (Testimony 4), was out of place (Testimony 3), and must be the assassin (Testimony 5).\n\nIf the Spy Camera footage (Evidence 21) is intact and records continuously, then it should show whether a bellboy actually came out of the room or not. If the footage shows no bellboy emerging at that time, then Powers' testimonies are false or mistaken.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction lies between:  \n- Evidence 21 (Spy Camera footage showing no bellboy coming out of the victim's room)  \n- Testimony 1 (Powers: \"And that's when that bellboy I saw earlier came out of the room!\")\n\nAs there is no direct description of the Spy Camera footage contents, but its presence suggests objective evidence that can contradict Powers' statements.\n\nThus, the pair that contradicts each other is Evidence 21 and Testimony 1.\n"

This suggests a contradiction: The autopsy and the watch give conflicting times for death.\n\nSince both the evidence are factual and the testimony is about the cable breaking, the only conflicting information is between the autopsy report (time of death 3 PM) and watch time stopped (3:05 PM). But the watch is not a testimony, so it's among evidences.\n\nLooking at the testimonies from Phoenix (Testimonies 0-4), they do not mention time or any conflicting statement directly related to the evidence.\n\nLooking further, Dahlia's Present (Evidence 7) says it was given to Wright on the day they met; but Phoenix says he never talked to the guy (Testimony 3), who is the victim (Doug Swallow). This is contradictory because the victim is Doug, and Wright claims he never talked to him (Testimony 3), yet he has a present from Dahlia, who dated the victim. However, this is only indirect.\n\nConsidering the vital contradiction:\n\n- Evidence 4 (Coldkiller X found in the victim's hand, covered in Wright's fingerprints).\n- Testimony 2: Phoenix says \"I hardly knew the guy to begin with.\"\n\nIf Phoenix hardly knew the guy, why are his fingerprints on the medicine found in the victim's hand? This indicates Phoenix had contact with the victim, contradicting his statement.\n\nTherefore, the evidence of Wright's fingerprints (Evidence 4) on the coldkiller medicine contrasts Phoenix's testimony (Testimony 2) saying he hardly knew the victim.\n"

Has pink splotches all over it. Broken and repaired by Adrian 2 weeks ago, then replaced in its box. Kept out of sight.\"\n- Evidence 5 (DeMasque's Calling Card) mentions the speckled urn and states the pink splotches were put on recently as paint, according to Pearl.\n- Evidence 21 (Urn Box) and Evidence 22 (Paint Marks) also relates to the pink paint stains on the urn box, which is completely dry, and Adrian knocked over some paint 2 weeks ago, causing those marks.\n\nThe testimonies from Atmey discuss the handling of the urn and the box, specifically:\n- Testimony 1: \"The urn was placed in a box, and Zvarri! It was then sent to the warehouse.\"\n- Testimony 5: \"At last, I held the urn in my hands for the first time at 1 AM on October 12th.\"\n\nHere is the contradiction:\n\nIf Atmey held the urn for the first time at 1 AM on October 12th (Testimony 5), it implies he did not have possession of it before then. However, the urn had been broken and repaired by Adrian two weeks prior and was replaced in the box kept out of sight (Evidence 4). Also, Testimony 1 suggests that Atmey had the urn boxed up and sent to the warehouse earlier. So, how could Atmey first hold the urn at 1 AM if it was already boxed and placed in the warehouse before then?\n\nThis conflicts because he claims to have sent the urn to the warehouse earlier (before October 12), yet also claims to have only held it first at 1 AM on October 12.\n\nHence, Evidence 4 (Sacred Urn info) contradicts Testimony 5 (Atmey's statement about first holding the urn).\n"

Evidence 19 (Buzzer Record) shows the buzzer went off once at 1:02 AM on October 12 in the CEO's office.\n6. Evidence 12 (Key Card) states usage at 1 AM on October 12.\n7. Evidence 18 (Kane's List) was found at the crime scene, but there's no direct relation mentioned.\n8. Testimony 0 states that Luke Atmey \"had no points of contact with the victim.\" But Evidence 4 (Sacred Urn) was found in Luke Atmey's office, perhaps indicating involvement.\n9. Evidence 6 notes: \"DeMasque knocked Atmey out during the crime with a blow to the back of the head.\" This conflicts with Atmey's statement of no contact with the victim? But the victim is Kane Bullard, not Atmey.\n\nAtmey's testimony seems somewhat contradictory with certain evidence:\n\n- Testimony 0 (Atmey): \"I had no points of contact with the victim whatsoever.\"\n- Evidence 4: Sacred Urn (a treasure of Kurain Village) was found in Luke Atmey's office.\n- Evidence 15: Kane Bullard's autopsy.\n\nHowever, owning or keeping the Sacred Urn in Atmey's office may not mean direct contact with Bullard.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 1: \"Kane Bullard decided to investigate Mask DeMasque and simply mistook who he was!\" Atmey claims Bullard mistook Mask DeMasque's identity.\n\nBut Evidence 5 (DeMasque's Calling Card) is addressed to Lordly Tailor Security and mentions 'speckled urn,' the very urn found in Atmey's office (Evidence 4). Mask DeMasque seems to be aware of the urn's location, meaning Atmey could have contact.\n\nThe strongest contradiction is between:\n\n- Evidence 6: \"DeMasque knocked Atmey out during the crime with a blow to the back of the head.\" This shows Atmey was present during the crime.\n\n- Testimony 0: Atmey says he \"had no points of contact with the victim whatsoever,\" implying a lack of involvement during the crime.\n\nSince Atmey was knocked out by DeMasque during the crime, indicating contact, but Atmey denies any contact with the victim (possibly Kane Bullard), this is contradictory.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between:\n\nEvidence 6 (DeMasque knocked Atmey out during the crime) and Testimony 0 (Atmey says no point of contact with the victim).\n"

This directly links Maggey to the poison.\n\nHowever, Testimony 6 by Kudo claims: \"There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front.\" This suggests he did not notice anything suspicious or unusual about Maggey.\n\nOn the other hand, Testimonies 1, 2, and 3 by Kudo describe a serving girl (implied to be Maggey) putting white powder in the drink, the victim drinking it, and then collapsing in pain.\n\nNow, summarizing the contradictions: The evidence clearly shows Maggey's fingerprints on the poison (Evidence 16), indicating she handled the poison. Kudo's testimonies 1, 2, and 3 accuse her of poisoning the drink.\n\nTestimony 6 (Kudo) contradicts this by saying he didn't notice anything suspicious about Maggey from the front.\n\nBut this is more a discrepancy in observation than a contradiction with evidence.\n\nIs there a stronger contradiction?\n\nLook at Evidence 12, Crime Photo: \"Near the coffee table are some pieces of papers. No one is sitting across from the victim.\" This indicates that no one was sitting in front of the victim at the time.\n\nTestimony 4 by Kudo says: \"That's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well!\" Meaning Maggey was sitting in the defendant's chair.\n\nIf the defendant's chair is opposite the victim, then the testimony says Maggey was sitting across the victim, but evidence says no one was sitting across from the victim.\n\nThis is a contradiction between Evidence 12 and Testimony 4.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is:\n\nEvidence 12 \u2014 No one sitting across from the victim.\n\nTestimony 4 \u2014 Maggey was sitting in the defendant's chair, presumably across from the victim.\n\nHence, Evidence 12 and Testimony 4 contradict.\n"

The victim was holding a newspaper in his right hand (mentioned in evidence 13 description as well).\n\nTestimony 1 by Kudo states: \"He had a newspaper in his right hand, and the noisy brat kept rustling its pages!\"\n\nThis suggests the victim was holding a newspaper in the right hand when drinking.\n\nHowever, Testimony 4 by Kudo states: \"The little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip.\"\n\nIf the victim was holding the newspaper in his right hand, he should have taken the sip with the left hand, but it's unclear whether that contradicts anything in the evidence.\n\nAlternatively, consider Evidence 10, Glen's Autopsy Report, says he died of potassium cyanide poisoning between 1:30 and 2:30 PM.\n\nNow, Testimony 2 says: \"The young man was listening to the wireless. I remember that well.\" Conflict arises if the wireless was broadcasting the radio show \"Millionaire Radio Flyer\" (Evidence 19), which airs Mondays at 1:30 PM. But no direct contradiction.\n\nLooking back at Evidence 6: Small Bottle found in kitchen, containing victim's ear medicine, covered in Furio Tigre's fingerprints.\n\nThere is no testimony mentioning Furio Tigre handling the ear medicine or presence, contradicting the fingerprints on the bottle.\n\nBut that's not a direct contradiction, more of a missing link.\n\nConsider Evidence 16: Potassium Cyanide powder found in Maggey's apron pocket with her fingerprints.\n\nBut evidence 13 (Coffee Cup) shows poison was in victim and Maggey's fingerprints on the cup.\n\nMaggey claims she was innocent, but the poison is on both victim and her.\n\nNothing in testimonies directly contradicts that.\n\nFocus now on Evidence 12: Crime Photo. No one was sitting across from the victim.\n\nIf Testimony 3 says: \"Then the serving girl in question brought over the javaccino.\" (implying the waitress placed the cup)\n\nIf Maggey was the waitress (Character 4), but found guilty.\n\nTestimony 0: Kudo describes victim as wearing broken spectacles, but victim found dead with no mention of spectacles in the evidence \u2014 no contradiction here.\n\nTestimony 1: \"newspaper in right hand,\" Evidence 13 says the victim had a newspaper in right hand on the coffee cup cup side.\n\nNo contradictions.\n\nUpon review, Testimony 2 says the victim was listening to wireless, while Testimony 1 says he was rustling pages.\n\nThese can coexist.\n\nThere's a more direct contradictory pair in Evidence 13's description:\n\nCoffee cup has a floral looking handle to the right and a lip stain on the front.\n\nPerson reading with right hand holding newspaper suggests they are right-handed and would hold the cup in left hand.\n\nIf the cup's handle is to the right, it would imply the cup is oriented for a right-handed person to drink.\n\nBut the victim was holding newspaper in right hand, so cup handle should be to left.\n\nThis is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, Evidence 13 (Coffee Cup) which implies cup handle is to the right and lip stain facing front, is inconsistent with Testimony 1 (Kudo): \"He had a newspaper in his right hand ...\"\n\nBecause if newspaper is in right hand, the cup handle should be to the left for drinking, but the cup handle is to the right, indicating left hand.\n\nHence, the cup orientation contradicts the testimony.\n"

According to the Victim's Note (Evidence 3), the victim was supposed to wear a white scarf for identification.\n\nHowever, the Crime Photo (Evidence 4) shows the victim wearing a coat and no scarf, and the coat is dry and clean.\n\nMelissa's Testimonies (Testimony 0-6) do not directly mention the scarf color discrepancy but focus on the fight and stabbing happening on the bridge.\n\nSince the victim was supposed to be wearing a white scarf (Evidence 3) but the scarf found is blue and muddy (Evidence 5), and the victim in the crime trunk photo (Evidence 4) is not wearing a scarf with a dry coat, this suggests inconsistency. But no testimony explicitly contradicts this.\n\nNow, considering Melissa's statements and the map:\n\nMelissa claims to be standing south of the bridge (Evidence 2,6 and her Testimony 1), but the victim is visible close to the broken end of the bridge facing a man in jail uniform (Evidence 6). The trunk photo shows the victim dead in the trunk, curled up, with a dry coat and no scarf.\n\nThe inconsistencies between the scarf evidence and testimony of where the incident occurred may imply contradiction.\n\nMost notable is the discrepancy between Evidence 5 (Scarf is blue, wet, muddy on the bridge) and the Victim's Note (Evidence 3), stating the victim should wear a white scarf.\n\nThe victim in Evidence 4 was not wearing any scarf but a coat, which is dry and clean.\n\nHence, the contradiction lies between Evidence 5 (the scarf found) and the Crime Photo in Evidence 4.\n\nThough no testimony explicitly contradicts this, the question asks for a pair of one evidence and one testimony that contradict each other.\n\nTestimony 6 (Melissa): \"She only got about 10 yards before she was stabbed in the back.\"\n\nBut Evidence 2 (Dusky Bridge Map) states that the bridge is broken midway towards the east, and the view from the south is obstructed by rocks.\n\nIf Melissa was standing on the south and could clearly observe the fight, it conflicts with the evidence that the view is obstructed.\n\nTherefore, there is a contradiction between Melissa's testimony about witnessing the event from the south and the Dusky Bridge Map indicating the view from the south is obstructed.\n\nTherefore, the contradictory pair is Evidence 2 (Dusky Bridge Map) and Testimony 1 (Melissa saying she saw two people on the bridge).\n"

This suggests that either the scarf was removed before placing the body in the trunk or the victim was moved or staged.\n\nWhile testimonies by Dahlia mainly discuss the kidnapping and attempt to kill her, they do not directly contradict the evidence of scarf and coat's state except possibly the implication that Fawles shoved the victim off the bridge from behind.\n\nSince the victim note and the scarf being worn by the victim conflict with the victim not wearing it in the crime photo and the coat being clean while the scarf is muddy, the best pair of direct contradiction lies between:\n\nEvidence 4 (Crime Photo) and Evidence 5 (Scarf)\n\nBut since the question asks for one evidence and one testimony pair, we must find a testimony contradicting an evidence:\n\nTestimony 3 says: \"That's when Mr. Fawles tried to kill me by shoving me off the bridge from behind!\"\n\nIf the victim was pushed off the bridge from behind, the victim would fall backward into the river and be wet and muddy; the scarf would be wet and muddy per Evidence 5. However, Evidence 4 shows the coat dry and clean in the trunk and no scarf, suggesting the victim was not found right after falling off the bridge, or was staged.\n\nSo, Testimony 3 states the attempt to kill by shoving off the bridge, implying the victim fell off the bridge.\n\nEvidence 4 says the victim was found dead in the trunk of a car with a dry and clean coat and no scarf, which contradicts the idea the victim fell off the bridge. \n\nThus, the safest contradiction is between Evidence 4 and Testimony 3.\n"

The actual weapon used to murder the victim.\"\n\n- Testimony 2 says: \"I saw the instant in which the blade, plunged into the hilt, was smoothly drawn out.\" This implies the blade drawn was the murder weapon.\n\n- Testimony 0 says: \"When I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place.\"\n\nThere is no direct conflict here.\n\n- Evidence 11 (Elise's Autopsy Report) gives the cause of death as \"loss of blood from stab in back.\"\n\n- Testimony 5 says that Ami was stabbing Elise through the back.\n\nNo contradiction here.\n\n- Evidence 6 (Iris's Hood) says \"Received before the lights out bell the night of the crime. Protects from evil spirits.\"\n\n- Testimony 12 (Iris's Testimony) says she \"rang lights out bell at 10 PM and was then in her room until the murder was discovered.\"\n\nNo contradiction.\n\n- Evidence 7 (Weather Data) says lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45, which was about 30 minutes before fire started and went out.\n\nNo contradictory testimony.\n\n- Evidence 19 (Dagger) states: \"Found stuck in a pine tree in Inner Temple Garden. The blood doesn't match the victim's.\"\n\nAssuming some testimony claims the dagger was the murder weapon, this would be a contradiction.\n\nBut no testimony says that.\n\n- Testimony 0 (Bikini) says the sword was already in place when she looked across the scene.\n\n- Testimony 2 says the blade was smoothly drawn out.\n\nThese are sequential and could align.\n\nFurther, Evidence 10 says the Shichishito had victim's blood and suspect's fingerprints but is NOT the murder weapon.\n\nIf a testimony claims the Shichishito is the murder weapon, it conflicts with Evidence 10.\n\nAre there any testimonies that claim Shichishito was the murder weapon?\n\nNo direct statement is seen.\n\nGiven all the above, the strongest contradiction is between:\n\n- Evidence 10: The Shichishito, though it had blood and fingerprints, was NOT the murder weapon.\n\n- Testimony 0 or 2 by Bikini which implies the sword was used in the stabbing.\n\nTestimony 2 says: \"I saw the instant in which the blade, plunged into the hilt, was smoothly drawn out.\"\n\nThis implies the blade was the murder weapon.\n\nIf the sword referenced by Bikini is the Shichishito, then this conflicts with Evidence 10.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 10 (Shichishito is not the murder weapon) and Testimony 2 (Blade used to stab).\n"

            "reasoning": "Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.\n\nEvidence 11 (\"Elise's Autopsy Report\") states that the time of death was between 10 - 11 PM. However, Testimony 0 (\"I saw the murder at around 11 PM...\") by Bikini conflicts slightly with this as the timing is at the edge of the range. More importantly, Testimony 12 (\"Iris's Testimony\") states that Iris rang the lights out bell at 10 PM and was then in her room until the murder was discovered, implying that the murder happened after 10 PM but before the discovery.\n\nEvidence 7 (\"Weather Data\") indicates that lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM. If the murder was observed \"at around 11 PM\" by Bikini, it is just fitting with the autopsy time.\n\nThe real contradiction arises between Evidence 10 (\"Shichishito\") and Evidence 9 (\"Victim's Staff\"). Evidence 10 says the \"Shichishito\" was not the murder weapon, even though it had blood and suspect\u2019s fingerprints on it. Evidence 9 says the actual murder weapon was the Victim's Staff, which had a hidden sword inside but no crystal sphere attached to it.\n\nNow, checking testimonies, however, none of the testimonies directly say which weapon was used clearly. So let's look for direct contradiction between evidence and testimony.\n\nTestimony 5 says: \"...Iris could have done that. She can drive a snowmobile after all...\" which suggests Iris might have played a role driving a snowmobile.\n\nEvidence 14 (\"Tracks Photo\") shows one track leading from Main Gate to Dusky Bridge. Evidence 7 shows snow and lightning with a lightning strike at 10:45 PM. Testimony 12 says Iris was in her room ringing the bell at 10 PM, which is before the lightning strike.\n\nNo direct contradiction here.\n\nBack to the autopsy and time of murder:\n\nTestimony 0 says \"I saw the murder at around 11 PM\",\n\nEvidence 11 says \"Time: 10 - 11 PM\" for time of death.\n\nIris says she was in her room after 10 PM.\n\nBikini (Testimony 0) saw the murder at 11 PM.\n\nNo contradiction.\n\nEvidence 16 (\"Crystal Sphere\") was found with blood on it, coming from the victim's staff. The sphere was found near Dusky Bridge covered in snow.\n\nTestimony 4 says: \"Maybe they threw the weapon into Eagle River and came back while I was knocked out?\"\n\nMeaning the murder weapon might have been disposed of.\n\nBut none of the testimonies contradict evidence.\n\nNow looking at Evidence 20 (\"Stone Lantern\"), which \"Was not lit the night of the crime.\" The candle or stone lantern in the garden was off.\n\nIf a testimony says there was light, that would contradict.\n\nBut no testimony mentions this.\n\nOverall, only one contradictory pair is:\n\nEvidence 10 (Shichishito) says it is \"Had victim's blood and suspect's fingerprints on it, but is not the murder weapon.\"\n\nWhereas the general assumption based on the weapon is that suspect was found with the \"Shichishito\" being weapon.\n\nIf any testimony says it was the murder weapon, that would contradict.\n\nNone of the testimonies given explicitly mention this though.\n\nHence, the only direct contradiction I can find is between:\n\nEvidence 11 (\"Elise's Autopsy Report\") - time of death between 10-11 PM.\n\nTestimony 0 (\"I saw the murder at around 11 PM...\") - the witness claims to have seen the murder at around 11 PM.\n\nIris (Evidence 12) says she rang the lights out bell at 10 PM and was then in her room until murder was discovered.\n\nIf the lights out bell was at 10 PM and Iris was in her room, she could not have committed the murder if the murder was at 11 PM.\n\nSo, Testimony 5 says \"Iris could have done that.\"\n\nSo evidence and testimony about Iris's presence contradict.\n\nTherefore, the direct contradiction is between Iris's testimony (Evidence 12) where she claims to be in her room at the time of the murder and Bikini's Testimony 0 where she says she saw the murder at about 11 PM.\n\nIf Iris was in her room starting at 10 PM until murder was discovered, she couldn't have done it at 11 PM.\n\nHence, the contradiction is between Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony) and Testimony 0 (Bikini's testimony).\n"

Has her fingerprints on it. Has a sword hidden inside. No one knows this except Detective Gumshoe and I. Has a sword hidden inside. The actual weapon used to murder the victim.\"\n\nEvidence 10 states: \"Shichishito - The apparent murder weapon. Had the victim's blood and the suspect's fingerprints on it, but is not the murder weapon.\"\n\nTestimonies 0 to 5 all describe Iris testifying about a violent struggle involving Elise and Maya, mentioning the staff and a dagger.\n\nThere is a contradiction between Evidence 9 and Evidence 10 regarding the actual murder weapon. The Shichishito was initially thought to be the murder weapon but evidence shows it was not, and the actual weapon was the victim's staff with a hidden sword. Testimony 3 says: She threw her staff away and pulled a dagger from inside her robe! Which suggests the dagger was the weapon.\n\nThis conflicts with Evidence 19, which is the Dagger: \"Found behind a tree in the Inner Temple garden. The blood doesn't match the victim's.\"\n\nSo Iris says the dagger was pulled and used to attack, but evidence shows the blood on the dagger doesn't match the victim's, implying it was not used.\n\nHence, the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (\"She threw her staff away and pulled a dagger\") and Evidence 19 (the blood on the dagger doesn't match the victim's, suggesting it was not the murder weapon).\n\nTherefore, Testimony 3 and Evidence 19 contradict each other.\n"

            "testimony": "When I returned, he was dead, blood streaming from a cut on his forehead.",
            "reasoning": "In Evidence 2 (Crime Photo 1), it is stated that the victim is wearing a hat which covers his eyes and forehead. However, Evidence 7 (Crime Photo 2) shows a photo of the forehead with the hat removed during investigation. This does not inherently contradict, but it clarifies the situation. \n\nTestimony 5 states that upon returning, Phoenix found the victim dead with blood streaming from a cut on his forehead. This aligns with Evidence 1 (Smith's Autopsy Report) that states the death was caused by a single blow to the forehead. So these do not contradict.\n\nEvidence 3 states that the grape juice bottle is the murder weapon and has the defendant Wright's prints on it, and that the prints are upside-down. This detail might be important in other testimonies.\n\nTestimony 2 says \"When the 'trap' failed, Smith hit the waitress.\" Testimony 4 says \"The girl was knocked out cold, and Smith was uncontrollable\". Both suggest Smith was aggressive and unstable before his death.\n\nTestimony 0 states that Kristoph and Phoenix had dinner sitting at the table in the photograph (Evidence 2), which is supported by Evidence 5, a photo of the defendant & Mr. Smith at the Borscht Bowl Club.\n\nGiven the information, one clear contradiction is between Evidence 3 and Testimony 0. Evidence 3 says the grape juice bottle has Wright\u2019s prints on it (upside-down), implying Wright had physical contact with the murder weapon. However, Testimony 0 states Phoenix and Kristoph had dinner elsewhere (implying the scene of the crime wasn\u2019t immediately near them), and no mention Phoenix was involved or held the bottle in Evidence 0. This is more circumstantial.\n\nAnother better contradiction is between Evidence 1 and Testimony 2. Evidence 1 says that the cause of death was a single blow to the forehead. Testimony 2 says \"When the 'trap' failed, Smith hit the waitress.\" This suggests the victim, Smith, was the aggressor hitting the waitress, not the victim being hit. This does not contradict the autopsy report directly.\n\nLooking again, Testimony 3: \"I discovered the 'trap' during the game, and disposed of the card in the bottle.\" This implies someone put a card inside the bottle. Evidence 3 says the bottle was used as a murder weapon and has Wright's prints on it. If the bottle was used as a weapon, then the card (trap) inside it might be in contradiction with the bottle being used as a blunt object with prints upside down - one would question if the bottle was intact or broken at the moment Phoenix disposed the card.\n\nIt seems the clearest contradiction lies between:\n\n- Evidence 3: The grape juice bottle used as the murder weapon, with Wright's prints on it.\n- Testimony 0: \"That evening, Kristoph and I had dinner. We sat at the table in the photograph.\" (Implying Phoenix was not near the crime scene or involved in the action to have fingerprints on the bottle).\n\nBut as this is circumstantial, not a direct contradiction.\n\nNow check Testimony 1: \"Shadi Smith walked in five minutes after Kristoph left.\" It suggests Smith arrived later, but Evidence 2 shows the victim already seated at the table.\n\nAlternatively, the hat covering forehead (Evidence 2) contradicts Testimony 5, which says blood was streaming from a cut on the forehead when Phoenix returned. If the hat was present at the time (covering forehead), how would blood be visible from a forehead cut?\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between:\n\n- Evidence 2: Victim is wearing a hat covering eyes and forehead (no visible injury)\n- Testimony 5: Blood streaming from a cut on forehead when Phoenix saw the body after returning.\n"

The bullet hit the man pulling the stand from the front, square in the forehead!\"\n\nThese two align because the right temple is part of the forehead area, so no contradiction there.\n\n- Testimony 2 states: \"The man facing the victim was the defendant.\"\n- Testimony 1 states: \"One man, pulling a stand. Another man, facing him.\"\n\nThis aligns logically.\n\n- Evidence 14 states: \"Weapon left at the crime scene. Two rounds were fired. Fingerprints were wiped.\"\n\n- Testimony 3 says: \"In his hand he held... yes, a pistol! It was pointed at the man pulling the stand.\"\n\nSo far no conflict.\n\n- Evidence 19 states: \"Bullet found in the Meraktis Clinic safe. Squished from impact with the back of the safe.\"\n\n- Evidence 10 (Knife) bears Wocky's prints. Wocky is the defendant (according to Character 7).\n\nNow, the most striking contradiction seems to involve the location of the injury and the victim\u2019s posture:\n\n- Evidence 9: Found in People Park, distinctive bloomers, stolen by Wesley Stickler.\n- Evidence 5: Cell Phone found in Meraktis Clinic garage beneath a car, property of Wesley Stickler.\n\nNo direct contradictions there.\n\n- Evidence 17: Lamp with a broken bulb and a red stain on the cord in Meraktis Clinic office.\n\nPotential blood evidence.\n\nNow the key contradiction:\n\n- Character 9, Pal Meraktis, victim, died pulling the noodle stand (Evidence 12).\n\n- Testimony 4 says: \"A shot! The bullet hit the man pulling the stand from the front, square in the forehead!\"\n\n- Evidence 11 Autopsy says the bullet hit the right temple, but a shot to the right temple is not the same as \"square in the forehead.\"\n\nFurthermore, Testimony 4 claims a frontal shot, while the autopsy suggests the right temple, which is to the side of the head.\n\nTherefore, there is a contradiction between Evidence 11 and Testimony 4 on the exact location of the gunshot wound: front square forehead vs. right temple.\n\nHence, the contradictory pair is Evidence 11 (Autopsy Report) and Testimony 4.\n"

He still shot the victim, pal!\"\n\nAssuming the victim is Magnifi and the clown is someone else, the testimonies suggest the shooting caused death.\n\nThe conflict seems to be on the timing and cause of death.\n\nLooking at Evidence 14 (Crime Photo): Body found in hospital room, shot in the forehead.\n\nEvidence 15: Death by single gunshot to the head, time of death 11:00-11:30 PM.\n\nEvidence 13: Drew Misham poisoned, time of death 9:00-9:30 PM.\n\nIf Gumshoe says the defendant shot the victim (Magnifi) in the forehead, and evidence confirms it, then the poisoning death of Drew Misham cannot be from the gunshot.\n\nNo contradiction there.\n\nNow, about the pistol:\n\nEvidence 20 says \"No fingerprints found\" on the pistol.\n\nTestimony 4 says: \"And the pistol definitely belonged to the old man, sir!\"\n\nIf the pistol belonged to the victim, there should be fingerprints, however, none found.\n\nThis suggests a contradiction between testimony 4 and evidence 20.\n\nHence:\n\n- Evidence 20 says no fingerprints on the pistol.\n\n- Testimony 4 asserts the pistol belonged to the victim.\n\nIf the pistol belonged to the victim (Magnifi), it would be unusual for the pistol to have no fingerprints from him.\n\nTherefore, the testimony and the evidence contradict each other.\n"

Testimony 0 states \"I saw nothing\", while Testimony 5 states \"I saw bullet holes in the wall\", meaning he saw something related to the crime. This is a contradiction within testimonies, not between evidence and testimony.\n\nNext, Evidence 5 is the Revolver belonging to Mr. LeTouse found at the crime scene. Evidence 9, the Crime Photo, shows the victim shot in the shoulder, lying face left. Evidence 10, Diagram, mentions bullet holes on the wall where the door was, in line with Lamiroir's Testimony 5.\n\nTestimony 2 says Lamiroir did not return backstage after the second set; Testimony 3 says he went backstage for a moment after his performance. If the performance was after the second set, that is a contradiction. Again, that is between testimonies.\n\nEvidence 15 and 17: The igniter was identical to Gavin's guitar, which burned the night of the concert. However, Testimony 6 says Lamiroir was led by police to Gavin's dressing room, suggesting he was there after the incident.\n\nNo direct contradictions there.\n\nTestimony 4 says LeTouse's body was behind a wall (was not visible); Evidence 9 says victim was lying with face left, bullet holes found on wall near victim. They match.\n\nAll things considered, the key contradiction is Testimony 0 (\"I saw nothing\") by Lamiroir, in direct conflict with Evidence 5 (Revolver belonging to Mr. LeTouse) and Testimony 5 (he saw bullet holes in the wall). Since Evidence 5 indicates a revolver found and testimony 5 says he saw bullet holes, Testimony 0 is contradicting both these facts. Choosing one pair, we say Testimony 0 contradicts Evidence 5, in that claiming \"I saw nothing\" conflicts with finding the murder weapon at the scene.\n"

In 0, he claims to be on guard duty in the foyer at the time of the murder, but in 2, he claims to be in his office at the time of the murder.

So we need one evidence and one testimony conflicting.\n\nGiven the TV listing evidence suggests a show was on at 3 PM, and Filch states he was on guard duty (Testimony 0) but also says he was in his office watching TV (Testimony 2), the evidence (TV listing) supports the possibility of him being in the office, but contradicts his claim of being on guard duty.\n\nTherefore, Evidence 13 (TV Listings) and Testimony 0 (Filch claiming to be on guard duty) contradict.\n"

This suggests that Mayor Tenma (Damian Tenma, Character 3) is not the Amazing Nine-Tails (possibly Rex Kyubi).\n\nBut Testimony 1 (L'Belle) says that the mayor would NEVER admit to such nonsense, implying the mayor is indeed the Amazing Nine-Tails, contradicting Testimony 0.\n\nSo this is more a contradiction between testimonies than an evidence - testimony contradiction.\n\nAlso, Evidence 7 (Fox and Demon Statue) indicates the statue that was used as the weapon to bludgeon the mayor, but the autopsy report (Evidence 14) says the mayor was stabbed with a spear. This is a contradiction between Evidence 7 and Evidence 14, but since both are evidence, not a testimony, this is not within the scope.\n\nEvidence 17 (Forbidden Chamber Key) says that the mayor took the key from the killer and swallowed it. However, the autopsy report (Evidence 14) says the mayor was found stabbed and in a drug-induced slumber. There is no mention of internal injuries from swallowing a key in the autopsy, which may be a contradiction, but this is evidence vs evidence.\n\nLooking at testimonies again, Testimony 12 (Jinxie's statement) says she saw a demon flee toward the foyer, but the foyer was occupied by Phineas Filch (Evidence 6), who claims he was guarding the entrance during the murder (testimony not given in this format), but no contradictory testimony given here.\n\nTestimony 0 (L'Belle) claims a fact about the Amazing Nine-Tails's identity that contradicts the content from Evidence 10 (mask with white hair inside), implying the alias is Rex Kyubi.\n\nTherefore, the main contradiction is between Testimony 0, which says The Amazing Nine-Tails's true identity is NOT Mayor Tenma, and Evidence 10, which suggests otherwise due to the white hair.\n\nHence, the pair contradicting each other are:\n\nEvidence 10 and Testimony 0.\n"

Testimony 3 also says he never went to the art room.\n\nEvidence 9 is a tape recording made at 7:10 PM in the art room with a woman shouting \"You're a goner!\", which was identified as fake, passed on by Prof. Means through Hugh.\n\nConsidering these, the contradiction lies between O'Conner's testimony that he never went to the art room (Testimony 3) and the attempt to implicate students was faked using the tape recorder (Evidence 9). However, that is more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 2 is Courte's planner documenting a meeting with Hugh on the 23rd and the day before the mock trial.\n\nThe main contradiction is that O'Conner claims to have been meditating alone at the archery range up to 7:00 PM (Testimony 0 and 5), but the time of death is estimated between 6 and 8 PM (Evidence 8), meaning he could have been near the crime scene.\n\nBut that is not a direct contradiction.\n\nMore clearly, in Testimony 3, O'Conner claims to have never been in the art room, yet Evidence 9 is a tape recording made in the art room and passed on to the police by Means through Hugh, who is an associate of O'Conner (or at least connected). This suggests inconsistency about presence around the art room.\n\nAlternatively, the tape recording is a fake, so this may not contradict.\n\nGiven the evidence, the strongest contradiction is that O'Conner states he was meditating alone at the archery range (Testimony 0 and 5), but Evidence 2 shows Hugh was scheduled to meet with Courte, and the murder weapon had Junie's fingerprints (Evidence 7) which may conflict with O'Conner's statements about movements.\n\nHowever, those are indirect.\n\nTherefore, focusing on the timeline:\n\nO'Conner says he was meditating at the archery range until 7 PM (Testimony 0 and 5).\n\nCourte was murdered between 6 and 8 PM (Evidence 8).\n\nThis means O'Conner's alibi only covers up to 7 PM at the latest.\n\nO'Conner says he never went to the art room (Testimony 3), but the tape recorder is evidence of activity in the art room at 7:10 PM (Evidence 9).\n\nIf O'Conner claims to be away, but Evidence 9 involves incriminating audio at the art room near that time, there may be a contradiction.\n\nHence, the best pairing is Evidence 9 and Testimony 3.\n"

There is no direct contradiction here since the testimonies form a consistent narrative.\n\nLooking through the evidence for contradictions:\n\nEvidence 7 (Awl) shows that Junie's fingerprints and Constance Courte's blood were found on the murder weapon.\n\nEvidence 8 (Courte's Autopsy Report) states the estimated time of death between 6 and 8 PM.\n\nEvidence 9 (Tape Recorder) includes a recorded conversation with a woman shouting \"You're a goner!\" at 7:10 PM. The recorded voice matches Junie's script but is identified as a fake. The tape was intentionally used to mislead the police.\n\nAmong the testimonies, O'Conner's testimonies do not conflict with the evidence.\n\nLooking into other testimonies and evidence to find a contradiction:\n\nThe main hint is that the tape recording in Evidence 9 is fake, which matches Junie's script. But this is not directly contradicted by testimonies provided.\n\nThe key is in the timeline: If the murder happened between 6 and 8 PM, and the tape recording was at 7:10 PM, and it's fake, so the claim that the woman was yelling \"You're a goner!\" in the room at 7:10 PM is false.\n\nSince the tape is fake, any testimony implying that someone heard that would be contradicted.\n\nHowever, none of the testimonies mention hearing that tape or hearing someone shout that; all testimonies are about Junie moving a mat.\n\nThus, no direct contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, let\u2019s check if any testimony conflicts with evidence about the weapon or the time of death. The testimonies are about Junie dragging a mat, so no contradiction there.\n\nTherefore, no contradiction between evidence 7/8 and testimonies 0-4.\n\nSince the question demands one contradicting pair, the only potential contradiction I can think of lies with the tape recorder.\n\nEvidence 9 says the tape is fake, planted by Prof. Means using Hugh to pass it on.\n\nIf a testimony confirmed that the voice shouting \"You're a goner!\" was genuine or happened at that time, it would contradict the evidence that the tape is a fake.\n\nSince no testimony mentions this, the only possible contradiction is between Evidence 9 stating the tape is fake and any testimony claiming the tape is genuine or that the voice was real.\n\nBut since no such testimony is in the list, no contradiction arises.\n\nHence, no contradicting pair found in this data based on the testimonies provided.\n\nBut the question mandates one pair.\n\nGiven that, the most plausible pair that is contradictory is between:\n\nEvidence 7: The weapon with Junie's fingerprints and Courte's blood\n\nand\n\nTestimony 1 or 2 or 3 or 4: O'Conner says Junie was dragging a large mat and moving toward the maintenance area; implying that Junie could not have committed the murder at the time.\n\nIf O'Conner was watching Junie at the time of murder, this conflicts with evidence that Junie's prints and Courte's blood are on the murder weapon.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 7 (Junie's fingerprints on the murder weapon) and Testimony 2 (O'Conner watching Junie from a vantage point between stage and maintenance area, implying Junie was away from the murder scene).\n\nTherefore:\n"

Evidence 7 shows a video of the defendant and victim's escape, which ends immediately afterward - so Starbuck is not shown in escape.\n\nTestimony 0 and 1 have Starbuck uncertain about his escape route.\n\nLooking closer at Evidence 16 \"Lighter\" which has Athena's fingerprints, yet the victim's blood is also on it; and Evidence 14 \"Aura's Statement\" says the perp held a lighter in their left hand and a knife in their right.\n\nEvidence 3 \"Utility Knife\" has victim's blood on its blade but no fingerprints.\n\nSince the victim was stabbed (Evidence 1), and the knife has victim's blood but no fingerprints, it contradicts Aura's Statement (Evidence 14) if the perp had the knife in their right hand (meaning fingerprints should be on the knife).\n\nMoreover, Evidence 14 says the perp held a lighter with an Earth emblem in their left hand and a knife in their right.\n\nEvidence 16 says Athena's prints are on lighter found on floor in victim's blood.\n\nBut Testimony 2 (Starbuck) says he was carrying the victim with the capsule, suggesting he was helping.\n\nSo the contradiction is between Evidence 14's statement that the perp held a lighter and a knife, yet Evidence 3 shows the knife (utility knife) has victim's blood but no fingerprints, meaning the perp wiped fingerprints, yet the lighter has Athena's fingerprints, implying that the perp did not wipe fingerprints from the lighter, inconsistent with Aura's statement.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction lies between Evidence 14 (Aura's Statement) and Evidence 3 (Utility Knife) regarding fingerprints and handling of the knife and lighter.\n\nAlternatively, focusing strictly on evidence and testimonies:\n\n- Evidence 8 shows victim's oxygen tank was struck by bullet.\n\n- Evidence 15 says the bullet from Arme's gun was a .38 caliber bullet found near oxygen tank.\n\n- Evidence 10 shows a bullet hole in boarding lounge made by .38 caliber gun.\n\n- Evidence 12 discovered bullet fired from .10 caliber handgun in the same area.\n\nGiven the discrepancy in calibers found at same location and Testimony by Starbuck uncertain about escape route.\n\nPossibly contradictory is the fact that there's a bullet from a .10 caliber handgun (Evidence 12), which is not accounted for in testimonies.\n\nBut these are all evidence-evidence conflicts.\n\nLooking at the testimonies:\n\n- Starbuck in Testimony 0 and 1 is uncertain about his escape route; in Testimony 2 he claims to have carried victim down.\n\nHence, contradiction between Testimony 0/1 (uncertainty) and Testimony 2 (clear recollection).\n\nBut question asks for evidence and testimony contradiction.\n\nLooking at Evidence 8 (victim's oxygen tank hit by bullet) and Testimony 2 (Starbuck says he was carrying victim down from upper level), these don't necessarily contradict.\n\nBut if victim was hit in oxygen tank in boarding lounge (Evidence 8), and Starbuck says he carried victim from upper level, perhaps it's contradictory: the victim was already injured at boarding lounge, suggesting victim was not moved after being hit.\n\nTherefore, Starbuck's testimony (2) that he was carrying victim down might be contradicted by Evidence 8 (oxygen tank hit near boarding lounge).\n\nHence, the pair:\n\nEvidence 8 (Oxygen Tank Data detail bullet injury of victim at boarding lounge)\n\nTestimony 2 (Starbuck says he carried victim down from upper level)\n\nIf victim was hit already at boarding lounge, it conflicts with Starbuck's claim.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 8 and Testimony 2.\n"

Yet Evidence 18 says a sleeping pill was found in Orla's stomach, which suggests Orla was alive and could have ingested something. However, Evidence 22 says Orla didn't eat anything. The fact that Orla didn't eat anything contradicts the idea that she would be active enough to ingest a pill, which conflicts with the testimonies about pool conditions and her state.\n\nTherefore, the testimonies about the cleaning (Testimony 3) and the risk to Orla (Testimony 6) conflict with evidence showing Orla did not eat anything (Evidence 22).\n\nSince we can only select one pair, the clearer direct contradiction is between Testimony 3 (\"During cleaning, the pool water is drained.\") and Evidence 22 (\"TORPEDO data shows that Orla didn't eat anything.\").\n\nIf the pool water was drained during cleaning (and Ori was there), she wouldn't be able to eat, which supports Evidence 22, so no contradiction there.\n\nTesting another pair: Testimony 2 says \"The record of card usage shows that Sasha entered the orca pool room.\"\n\nEvidence 14 says \"A key card for gaining access to the orca pool. Only the victim and Sasha had one.\"\n\nEvidence 12 says \"Shipley's walkie-talkie hasn't been found.\"\n\nNo direct contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 0 says \"Sasha was cleaning the orca pool room in early morning hours.\"\n\nEvidence 5 says \"Security Footage shows the orca pool from the visitor's corridor. The footage starts at aquarium's 10 AM opening time.\"\n\nIf cleaning started in early morning but security footage starts at opening time, there could be missing footage from cleaning time, but not contradiction.\n\nLooking at the times from Evidence 12: Estimated Time of Death: From 12:00 to 10:00 AM on July 20th.\n\nThat conflicts with Testimony 4: \"While cleaning was going on, Marlon was taking care of the orca in the show pool.\" and possibly Testimony 0.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 6 warns about the danger to Orca if pool water is drained. Evidence 12 says death thought to be result of orca attack after 65-ft fall into pool, but pool is about 65 feet deep (Evidence 3).\n\nAlso Evidence 18 says the capsule in Orca's stomach is a sleeping pill, but no evidence or testimony mentions the orca swallowing anything.\n\nThus, contradiction between Evidence 18 and Testimony 22: Evidence 18 says sleeping pill in Orca's stomach, but Evidence 22 says Orca didn't eat anything.\n\nSo the contradiction is between two evidences.\n\nOur task is to find contradiction between one testimony and one evidence.\n\nTestimony 6: \"If there were no water in the pool, the orca might die.\" suggests orca survival dependent on pool water.\n\nEvidence 22: \"TORPEDO data shows Orla didn't eat anything.\" suggests orca inactive.\n\nBut no direct contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 2 says \"The record of card usage shows that Sasha entered the orca pool room.\"\n\nEvidence 12 says \"Shipley's walkie-talkie hasn't been found.\"\n\nNo contradiction.\n\nLooking at the name \"Swashbuckler Flyer\" (Evidence 1) says \"Sasha was not slated to return.\"\n\nTestimony 1 says \"Sasha and Shipley were scheduled to do cleaning together.\"\n\nScheduling conflicts.\n\nTherefore:\n\nTestimony 1: \"Sasha and Jack were scheduled to do the cleaning together.\"\n\nEvidence 1: \"Sasha was not slated to return\" (implying she was not going to be there at all)\n\nThis suggests that Sasha wasn't scheduled (or supposed) to return, yet in testimony they were scheduled together.\n\nHence, contradiction between Evidence 1 and Testimony 1.\n"

Evidence 12 states the estimated time of death is between 12:00 AM and 10:00 AM on July 20th, and the death was instant from brain contusion believed to be caused by orca attack. However, the testimony by Rimes states that Orla killed the captain by bashing him thirty feet high and slamming him into the water \u2013 this suggests a violent physical act was directly witnessed or inferred.\n\nBut the big contradiction lies in whether the orca was in the pool at the time of the incident or not. Testimony 1 says that at 3:30 AM on the 20th, there was still water in the orca pool \u2013 suggesting the orca could have been present.\n\nAlso, Evidence 22 (TORPEDO Data) shows that Rifle ate around 4:00 AM on July 20th but Orla didn't eat anything \u2013 suggesting Orla was possibly unconscious or incapacitated at that time.\n\nIf Orla wasn't active or capable of attack at the relevant time, Rimes's testimony that Orla killed the captain by bashing him is suspicious.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between:\n\nEvidence 22: Orla didn't eat anything at 4:00 AM on July 20th \u2014 suggesting inactivity.\n\nTestimony 3: Orla killed the captain by bashing him thirty feet high and slam into the pool.\n\nHence, these contradict each other regarding Orla's involvement at that specific time.\n"

The box \"not even the Magatama Key can open it,\" and the Magatama Key is described in Evidence 7 as the sole key for opening the treasure box, kept by Andistan'dhin.\n\nTestimony 3 by Andistan'dhin says: \"Hands unclean, the accused did the deed. Forced the box open. No key did he need.\"\n\nTestimonies 1 and 5 by Andistan'dhin state: \"The real method to open the lock, you say?! Delusional, man! There ain't no other way!\" and \"Only the Mitamah Key unlocks the treasure. Force it, and reap the founder's displeasure!\", respectively.\n\nSo, according to Andistan'dhin\u2019s testimonies, the box can only be opened with the Mitamah Key (likely the Magatama Key), and there is no other way to open it. Therefore, forcing the box open is frowned upon and leads to displeasure.\n\nYet, in Evidence 4, the Treasure Box is forced open, implying the box lock can be forced. Testimony 3 claims the accused forced the box open without a key.\n\nThis directly conflicts with testimony 1 and 5 and the implication that only the key (kept by Andistan'dhin) can open the box.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction lies between Testimony 3, which claims the accused forced the box open without a key, and the evidence that the box is only opened by the Magatama Key and forcing it leads to displeasure.\n\nHence, the contradicting pair is Evidence 4 (Treasure Box forced open and contents stolen, and only the key can open it) and Testimony 3 (claim that the accused forced open the box without a key).\n"

Poniponi is 2298 meters and to the west. Ihmus claims (Testimony 1) that just as Mt. Poniponi was drawing near, something terrible happened (wind?), and he had to make an emergency landing at the Inner Sanctum, which lies in the opposite direction. Given their relative positions (Inner Sanctum east, Mt. Poniponi west), it seems contradictory that he was approaching Mt. Poniponi and then landed at the Inner Sanctum nearby.

If the victim was suffocated by having his face submerged in a bowl of soba, one might expect fluids or soba to be in the lungs. But the autopsy report says nothing was found in his lungs.\n\nSo the contradiction lies between:\n\n- Evidence 3: Nothing was found in lungs, cause of death suffocation.\n\n- Evidence 2: Crime Scene Report showing the victim's face thrust into a soba bowl (which would imply fluid or food in lungs).\n\nTherefore, this pair contradicts in relation to the cause and manner of suffocation.\n\nBut the question asks to find a pair of one evidence and one testimony contradicting each other.\n\nLooking at testimonies, Testimony 0 says Uendo was onstage until moments before going to the dressing room. If the dressing room door and yard door face each other and block view, maybe that's consistent.\n\nNone of the testimonies directly discuss the cause of death or the position of the victim, so let's check Simon's Statement (Evidence 6) that is Simon's eyewitness account.\n\nIf Simon's statement says something about the time or manner inconsistent with the autopsy, that might be a contradiction.\n\nBut no testimony appears to conflict with Evidence 3.\n\nLooking again at Testimony 4: \"I think there must have been fifty, maybe sixty people in the audience.\" But Kisegawa (Testimony 1) says \"The entire audience was my witness,\" which might or might not imply the audience size.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 5 says \"The story I performed is called 'Tokisoba' \u2014 otherwise known as 'Time Soba.'\" Evidence 5 indicates \"Time Soba\" was to be performed by Master Toneido himself.\n\nSo Uendo says he performed \"Time Soba,\" but the invitation says it was to be performed by Master Toneido.\n\nThat is a contradiction.\n\nTo be sure:\n\n- Evidence 5 (Invitation): The show \"Time Soba\" was to be performed by Master Toneido.\n\n- Testimony 5 (Uendo): \"The story I performed is called 'Tokisoba' \u2014 otherwise known as 'Time Soba.'\"\n\nIf the victim was Master Toneido, and Uendo says he performed \"Time Soba,\" that contradicts the invitation.\n\nSo the contradiction is between Evidence 5 and Testimony 5.\n\nHence:\n"

This supports Ema's point about stolen artifacts.\n\nHowever, Evidence 3 (Study Photo) and Evidence 4 (Study Diagram) show that the victim (Dr. Buff) was found lying in the study, with a book stained with coffee nearby, as well as large windows with clear glass. This setup suggests a peaceful environment, inconsistent with the idea of Dr. Buff being the thief as suspected in the testimonies.\n\nBut mostly, the Evidences and Ema's testimonies seem consistent.\n\nLooking further, evidence 19, the Pink Butterfly Pendant, states it actually belongs to Amara but was said to belong to Dhurke and was stained with the victim's blood. This might conflict with someone\u2019s statement but not Ema.\n\nEma only gave the testimonies accusing Dr. Buff of theft.\n\nLooking at Evidence 11, the Raincoat, which seems to have been worn by the doctor the previous night.\n\nLooking for a direct contradiction between evidence and testimony.\n\nTestimony 4 states \"As for the relic at the center of this dispute, he likely stole it from the Atishon residence.\"\n\nHowever, Evidence 6, the Orb Transfer Agreement, states that the Founder's Orb was willingly handed over to the Defiant Dragons via an agreement that promises no harm.\n\nTherefore, if the Orb was transferred via an agreement, then it could not have been stolen, which contradicts Ema\u2019s assertion in Testimony 4.\n\nThus, Ema's Testimony 4 that Dr. Buff likely stole the relic directly contradicts Evidence 6, the Orb Transfer Agreement, indicating the orb was handed over willingly.\n"

He was shot three times in the chest.\"\n\nTestimony 5 states: \"He must have regrouped and killed my papa in the study later -- I just know it!\" spoken by Sarge, implying that Dhurke was killed in the study possibly after Datz was ejected.\n\nEvidence 3 (Study Photo) shows the victim lying in the study next to windows, covered by books.\n\nTestimony 3: \"From my window, I saw the one designated 'Datz' getting ejected from the premises.\"\n\nSo Sarge testifies that Datz was seen leaving, then suggests Datz regrouped and killed Dhurke later in the study.\n\nBut the medical report (Evidence 13) says Dr. Buff was killed between 10 and 11 PM, but Dhurke's death time is uncertain. However, the corpse photo says more than three days have passed since death, so timing is vague here.\n\nNo direct contradiction there.\n\nNow Evidence 19 states: \"Pink Butterfly Pendant: A pendant adorned with a pink butterfly. Seems it belongs to Dhurke. Stained with the victim's blood. A locket found at the crime scene. It actually belongs to Amara.\"\n\nSo, the pendant belongs to Dhurke but actually belongs to Amara. This is an internal contradiction in the evidence itself but not between evidence and testimony.\n\nThe main contradiction is here:\n\nEvidence 6: Orb Transfer Agreement states: \"I agree to hand over the Founder's Orb to the Defiant Dragons if I will come to no harm.\"\n\nTestimony 5: Sarge says: \"He must have regrouped and killed my papa in the study later -- I just know it!\"\n\nSarge is accusing Datz of killing Dhurke. But from Evidence 6, Dhurke was supposed to be safe if he handed over the orb.\n\nAlso, the scent of glowing moss (Evidence 8) stuck to the doctor's boot is suspicious.\n\nLooking further:\n\nEvidence 15 (Inga's Autopsy Report): Stabbed from behind. Cause of death blood loss. Time approximately 3 PM.\n\nTestimony 25 states: \"At around 2 PM, Shah'do was surprised by a firecracker, ran into the courtyard, and stole Nayna's hat.\"\n\nFirecracker could be a distraction.\n\nTestimony 1 and 2 by Sarge talk about hearing arguing in his father's study and someone being ejected - Datz.\n\nTestimony 5 says Datz went on to kill Dhurke.\n\nBut Evidence 29 says Dhurke was shot three times in the chest.\n\nEvidence 11: Raincoat, distinctive design.\n\nSarge is Dr. Buff's kid, but Dr. Buff is Evidence 13, killed between 10 and 11 PM.\n\nThere is a contradiction between Sarge's testimonies that Datz killed Dhurke in the study later, but the Study Photo (Evidence 3) shows the victim lying covered with books next to windows, and Datz fleeing was seen earlier (Testimony 3). If Datz left early, he couldn't have killed Dhurke later in the study.\n\nHence, the contradiction is between:\n\nEvidence 3: Study Photo shows victim collapsed in the study with many books, and\n\nTestimony 3: Sarge saw Datz being ejected from the premises from his window.\n\nTestimony 5: Sarge claims Datz regrouped and killed the doctor later in the study.\n\nBut Evidence shows Datz left early and the victim was already dead or found there; so the testimony that Datz killed the doctor later contradicts the evidence that also shows the victim lying in the study with Datz having been ejected already.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 3 and Testimony 5.\n"

He is covered by books.\"\n\nThis aligns with the doctor being near the bookshelf.\n\nTherefore, no clear contradiction there.\n\nBut Testimony 1 states Atishon saw the murder, while Testimony 0 conflicts with the timing of that event.\n\nHence, the contradiction is between Evidence 13 (time of death 10-11 PM) and Testimony 0 (Atishon being somewhere else at around 11 PM).\n\nAlternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 0 and Testimony 1 (both by Atishon), but the instruction asks for one pair of evidence and testimony.\n\nTherefore:\n\nEvidence 13 contradicts Testimony 0, because the time of death implies the murder happened between 10 and 11 PM, but Testimony 0 says Atishon was not at the scene at that time.\n"

I am ashamed I let her go so far for my sake.\"\n\nThis implies that Nahyuta's mother (Queen Amara) was covering up for him, which contradicts Nahyuta's open confession in Testimony 1.\n\nSo, Testimony 1 (Nahyuta's confession) and Testimony 4 (mother covering for him) contradict each other.\n\nSince the question asks for evidence and testimony pair, let's check if any evidence contradicts his confession.\n\nEvidence 20 (Mysterious Bloodstain) shows Dhurke\u2019s blood wiped at the tomb, possibly indicating Dhurke\u2019s involvement, which might contradict Nahyuta's claim.\n\nBut focusing strictly on evidence and testimony:\n\nEvidence 15 & 17 proves Inga was killed by stabbing from behind.\n\nNahyuta confesses to the murder (Testimony 1).\n\nBut his mother is covering for him (Testimony 4), which conflicts with Nahyuta's confession.\n\nHowever, as both are testimonies, we need an evidence and testimony contradiction.\n\nLooking deeper: Evidence 29 (Dhurke's Corpse Photo) shows Dhurke was killed by gunshots, presumably three days ago.\n\nEvidence 19 says the Pink Butterfly Pendant belongs to Amara but was found at the crime scene and is stained with victim's blood, indicating her presence at the crime scene.\n\nTestimony 5 says Nahyuta was reunited with his mother (Queen Amara) 15 years ago when Dhurke abducted her - meaning she is alive.\n\nThis conflicts with the evidence suggesting Amara's presence at the crime scene (Evidence 19) stained with victim's blood.\n\nIf Amara is queen and supposed to be alive, her presence at the crime scene stained with victim's blood could be suspicious.\n\nHowever, to find a contradiction, let's analyze Evidence 15 and Testimony 1.\n\nEvidence 15 states the time of death is approximately 3 PM.\n\nTestimony 0 implies Nahyuta couldn't remain silent while Her Eminence (likely Queen Amara) fell under suspicion.\n\nIf Nahyuta killed Inga, but the evidence points to someone else (Amara), then Nahyuta's confession (Testimony 1) conflicts with the facts in Evidence 19.\n\nTherefore, the contradictory pair could be:\n\nEvidence 19: Pink Butterfly Pendant belongs to Amara and is stained with the victim's blood found at the crime scene, suggesting Amara was involved in or present at the murder.\n\nTestimony 1: Nahyuta confesses to killing Minister Inga.\n\nIf Nahyuta did it, then why is Amara's pendant at the scene stained with victim's blood?

            "testimony": "The victim was hit with it from behind, and he fell over, right into the lantern.",
            "reasoning": "The evidence and testimonies mostly align with each other: the Time Keeper is identified as the murder weapon (Evidence 4 and Testimony 0), the victim was hit twice (Evidence 14 and Testimony 3), and the victim's body was found inside the lantern (Evidence 5, 6 and Testimonies indirectly imply this). However, Ema's Testimony 1 states the victim was hit from behind, but Evidence 7, Gloomsbury's Note near the victim's body, is smudged as if written by a right-handed person. Assuming Gloomsbury is right-handed, it may be unlikely that he was hit from behind, as typically someone struck from behind may not be able to leave such a note, or the note would not be written in a smudged manner. This creates a slight contradiction about the circumstances of the murder and the victim's interaction with the environment right before the death. Still, this is a weak contradiction.\n\nA clearer contradiction is related to the Bloodstain evidence and the location of the victim. The bloodstain on the lift (Evidence 16) matches the blood found on the candelabra (Evidence 17), which has Gloomsbury\u2019s fingerprints. This implies Gloomsbury was injured near the lift. However, the victim was found inside the lantern (Evidence 5, 6), which was moved to the reception hall. Ellen's Statement (Evidence 2) says she saw a suspicious third party on the vista deck when attacked by Gloomsbury, but there is no evidence supporting the presence of such a third party at the vista deck, and the blood evidence suggests Gloomsbury was injured near the lift and candelabra, not on a vista deck. So Ellen's statement and the blood evidence contradict.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 2 (Ellen\u2019s Statement) and Evidence 16 or 17 (Bloodstain and Candelabra), or partly with the testimonies that accept the place of injury as elsewhere.\n\nGiven the instructions to only output one pair and that the testimonies are all from Ema and do not cover Ellen\u2019s statement, the contradiction is between Evidence 2 and the blood evidence (Evidence 16 or 17). Since 2 and 17 relate well, we can say the contradiction is between Evidence 2 and Evidence 16 or 17, but since only testimonies and evidences pairs count, and Ellen's statement is an evidence, the contradiction is between Evidence 2 and the fact that the blood evidence does not support the presence of a third party on the vista deck at the time of the attack.\n\nHowever, since the request is to find a contradiction between one evidence and one testimony, let's reconsider testimonies.\n\nAll testimonies are from Ema, who says the victim was hit from behind (Testimony 1), and the note was smudged as though written by a right-handed person (Evidence 7). If the victim was hit from behind (Testimony 1), it suggests the victim wouldn't have been able to write the note afterward. The note was found near the victim's body.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 7 (Gloomsbury's Note) which implies the victim was able to write, and Testimony 1 (the victim was hit from behind), which suggests the victim was attacked unexpectedly and likely incapacitated before writing.\n\nHence, the contradictory pair is Evidence 7 and Testimony 1.\n"

So we need to map Nichody's statement as testimonial evidence.\n\nBut in the testimonies, Sorin says \"Pierce heard the commotion,\" \"I was stabbed,\" but no direct mention of candelabra.\n\nThus, Nichody's account (the statement repeated in the evidences) contradicts the autopsy report which disagrees with that the candelabra was used.\n\nHence, the contradiction is between Evidence 14 (Autopsy Report) and Nichody's statement attached to multiple evidences (which acts as testimony). Since the testimonies are numbered and assigned to persons and Nichody is not assigned a numbered testimony, there is no direct testimony line for Nichody.\n\nLooking at the testimonies assigned to Sorin, he never says what weapon suspected was. The contradiction is between Evidence 14 and Nichody's account.\n\nGiven the instruction to output one evidence and one testimony pair, we must pick one testimony.\n\nThe only testimony that describes the injury and speaks about being stabbed is Testimony 3: \"I was badly injured from being stabbed, but I was frantic.\"\n\nTestimony 3 is Sorin's statement and can be seen in conflict with Evidence 14 regarding the actual weapon.\n\nBut Testimony 3 does not specify weapon type, only injury.\n\nLooking for testimony that contradicts the murder weapon:\n\nNone specify the murder weapon explicitly.\n\nBut Nichody's statement is repeated for all evidences, strongly claiming the candelabra was the weapon.\n\nSo the contradiction is between nichody's account (a testimony) and autopsy report. \n\nTherefore, select Evidence 14 (Autopsy Report) and Nichody's statement (testimony). Since Nichody has no numbered testimony, we may assume they are not counted as testimonies.\n\nAlternatively, pick Testimony 3 (Sorin's statement about stabbing) which does not mention weapon but can be linked as contradicting the evidence.\n\nAlternatively, consider Testimony 0 (I went to the vista deck with Pierce) is neutral.\n\nTestimony 2: \"That's why my name doesn't appear on the hold entry record,\" is relevant about access.\n\nNo explicit contradiction here.\n\nIn summary, the only notable contradiction from the info given is that the candelabra (Evidence 17) is claimed by Nichody to be the stabbing weapon, but autopsy report (Evidence 14) says the Time Keeper was the murder weapon.\n\nHence, I will answer:\n\n{\"evidence\": 14, \"testimony\": 1} \n\nBut 1 is Sorin saying \"Pierce heard the commotion...\" - not related.\n\nAlternatively pick Testimony 3 (Sorin's stabbing comment).\n\nGiven the situation, the best match is:\n\nEvidence 14 (Autopsy Report) vs testimony assigned to Nichody (which is not numbered).\n\nAlternatively, pick the testimony 3 about stabbing.\n\nHence:\n"

I'd suffer the most from losing him.\") might suggest Nichody is trying to hide something.\n\nBut the clearest contradiction is between the Autopsy Report (Evidence 14), which states the Time Keeper was used as the murder weapon, and Nichody\u2019s alibi in Testimony 5, where he claims he had no opportunity to murder Gloomsbury.\n"

I swear it! ...B-B-But, um...\"\n\nWhereas other testimonies imply more people were on the omnibus, including Fairplay, Furst (Testimony 2), and Gina Lestrade (Character 8) who witnessed the incident.\n\nSo Beppo contradicts the testimonies of others about the number of passengers.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Beppo's Testimony 0 and the presence of characters who testified (Fairplay, Furst, etc.) about their presence.\n\nBut the question asks for contradiction between evidence and testimony.\n\nEvidence 4 shows the omnibus had passengers both inside and on the roof deck that night.\n\nTherefore, the omnibus held more than four passengers.\n\nHence, Beppo's Testimony 0 contradicts Evidence 4.\n\nThus, the pair is:\n\nEvidence 4: Omnibus that was the scene of the crime with passengers both inside and on the roof deck.\n\nTestimony 0: Beppo says he only carried four passengers that night, being unsure.\n\nThis is an evidence and testimony contradiction.\n"

Otherwise, visibility would be reduced.\n\nTherefore, Testimony 0 and Testimony 1 contradict each other, but the prompt asks for an evidence-testimony contradiction.\n\nLooking at the evidence, Evidence 1 is a Local Map, which doesn't contradict either testimony.\n\nEvidence 4 says the pavement where the victim was found lies just outside Constable Beate's beat, which doesn't relate to visibility.\n\nNo evidence explicitly mentions weather conditions.\n\nTherefore, the contradictions between testimonies 0 and 1, being internal, are outside the scope.\n\nLooking further:\n\nTestimony 2 says the victim was stabbed from behind (which aligns with evidence of the knife in the back).\n\nNo contradictions there.\n\nEvidence 8 states the book was found in the victim's hand. But testimony 2 says the victim was stabbed from behind and collapsed\u2014no real contradiction.\n\nEvidence 12 says fragment of metal stuck inside Mr Garrideb's pipe, relating to a domestic dispute.\n\nTestimony 3 says the accused ran off, scattering belongings (which can include the books from evidence).\n\nNo contradiction.\n\nTherefore, focus again on evidences about visibility.\n\nTestimony 0 says light fog at 5 pm.\n\nTestimony 1 says visibility was reasonably good and no one else about but victim and accused.\n\nIf there was a fog (even light), visibility is somewhat impaired, but \"reasonably good\" could still apply. So perhaps not a strong contradiction.\n\nBut the victim was the only other person about means no witnesses other than Gregson? However, testimonies 6 and others do not contradict.\n\nNo evidence contradicting visibility.\n\nHence, let's analyze the discrepancy related to the knife:\n\nEvidence 5 and 6 both say that a large knife was found lodged in the victim's back.\n\nEvidence 12: fragment of metal stuck in the pipe, tip of a knife blade.\n\nIf the pipe broke in a domestic dispute (Evidence 11), then the fragment (Evidence 12) would be from the pipe, not a knife.\n\nAssuming that, no contradiction.\n\nThen, Testimony 2 says victim stabbed from behind, which aligns with Evidence 5 and 6 (knife in back).\n\nNo contradiction.\n\nThen, Testimony 1 says \"no one else about but victim and accused,\" but characters 10 and 11 (the Beates) witnessed the incident (per description). That would contradict testimony 1's claim.\n\nBut as it's not an evidence-testimony contradiction, this doesn't qualify.\n\nSimilarly, Evidence 4 says the pavement where the victim was found lies just outside Constable Beate's beat, implying the Beates may have been just outside their beat, but they did witness the incident.\n\nTestimony 1 says no one else about but victim and accused, but Beates witnessed the incident outside their beat.\n\nThat is a contradiction between testimony and evidence.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Evidence 4: The pavement where the victim was found lies just outside Constable Beate's beat.\n\n- Testimony 1: Visibility was reasonably good, and there was no one else about but the victim and the accused.\n\nSince Beates witnessed the incident (per the character description and evidence), there was someone else about. Hence, testimony 1 contradicts evidence 4.\n\nTherefore, the pair is:\n\nEvidence 4 and Testimony 1.\n"

But again, this is not necessarily contradictory.\n\nGiven this, the clearest contradiction is between:\n\nEvidence 4: The pawn ticket with a bloody fingermark belonging to Mr Mason.\n\nand\n\nTestimony 1: Graydon claims that the redemption ticket was stolen by Gina.\n\nIf the blood on the ticket is identified as Mr Mason's (who is not Gina), this implies conflicting ownership/possession claims.\n\nTherefore, the evidence of a bloody ticket with Mr Mason's blood (Evidence 4) contradicts Graydon's testimony that the ticket was stolen by Gina (Testimony 1).\n\nHence, choosing this contradiction.\n"

However, that is not necessarily a contradiction, since the disk might or might not be Morse code.\n\nEvidence 4 is a bloody redemption ticket with blood identified as Mr Mason's, but there is no testimony about this.\n\nThe significant contradiction comes from Evidence 12 (Windibank's Gun) and 13 (Skulkin Brothers' Gun) and the testimonies from Nash and Ringo. The Skulkin brothers admit to breaking in (Testimonies 3 and 4), but there is evidence that Gina was holding Windibank's gun (Evidence 12) with signs of discharge, yet the Skulkin brothers' gun was also fired (Evidence 13).\n\nBut this is not necessarily a contradiction in testimonies.\n\nLooking further, there is no testimony about the shooting direction.\n\nTestimony 0: Graydon says \"A mere communications officer couldn't possibly steal confidential government information!\"\n\nEvidence 8 (Today's Paper) has an article about government secrets being leaked to foreign agencies, implying that maybe the communications officer was involved, contradicting Graydon's claim.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 0 and Evidence 8.\n"

However, the autopsy says the bullet wound was only in the back and there were no other injuries.\n\nIf the girl was covered in blood spatter, it suggests the shooting was close and frontal or the girl was very close and directly in the path of the blood, which conflicts with the knife wound being solely in the back.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 1: \"When Windibank threw Nash over the counter, I felt a sharp pain in my arm.\" If this is true, this would place Greyson near Nash, but if Nash and Ringo were inside the storeroom (Testimony 2) while the shot was fired in the back (Evidence 9 & 10), then perhaps Testimony 1 conflicts with the position suggested by Evidence 11 (Crime Scene Floor Plan).\n\nThe clearest contradiction is with Evidence 12 (Windibank's Gun) and Testimony 3 (the accused in a black coat fired the shot). The gun taken from Gina (the accused) belonged to the victim and was found with signs of a single discharge, but Evidence 13 shows another gun found with the Skulkin brothers (Nash and Ringo) that also has signs of a single discharge.\n\nIf the victim was shot in the back by the accused, in a black coat (Testimony 3), but both the victim's gun and the Skulkin brothers' gun have signs of firing, this suggests two shots fired, whereas the autopsy says a single bullet killed the victim.\n\nThus, Testimony 3 (claiming the accused shot the victim) contradicts Evidence 13 (suggesting the Skulkin brothers' gun was fired as well), especially if the victim's gun and the Skulkin brothers' gun both have signs of being fired once, conflicting with the autopsy saying a single bullet wound killed the victim.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between the statement that the accused shot the victim and the evidence of two guns being fired once each when only one bullet is accounted for in the victim's body.\n\nHence, the contradictory pair is Evidence 13 (Skulkin Brothers' Gun) and Testimony 3 (the accused shot the man in the back).\n"

Not directly, but somewhat suspicious.\n\n- The key contradictory pair comes from Menimemo\u2019s claim that stabbing proves innocence (Testimony 0), but a knife with no poison and only one wound suggests stabbing was the cause of death.\n\nNo contradiction there.\n\nHow about the time of death or cause of death?\n\nNo data conflicts.\n\nNow, consider:\n\n- Evidence 7 says no poison on the blade.\n\n- Testimony 1 and 5 say poisoning would make stabbing unnecessary.\n\n- Evidence 4 says poison was stolen.\n\n- Testimony 3 says discussion about stolen poison.\n\nNo contradictions.\n\nCheck Rei\u2019s testimony:\n\n- Rei denies involvement in murder (Testimony 3).\n\n- Evidence 5 shows Rei kneeling over the victim as the victim was attacked.\n\nThis could be contradictory depending on the context.\n\nPossibility:\n\n- Rei claims discussion about poison, no murder involvement.\n\n- Evidence 5 (photograph) shows Rei kneeling over victim at the moment of attack, implying involvement possibly as an attacker or immediate witness.\n\nHowever, kneeling over someone doesn\u2019t imply attack necessarily.\n\nGiven limited data, this is less direct.\n\nAnother pair:\n\n- Testimony 0 (Menimemo): \"I stabbed the Englishwoman.

This is illogical.\n\n- Evidence 0 (Post-Mortem Report) states only a single wound from the knife caused death.\n\n- Evidence 7 states no poison on the knife.\n\nTherefore, Menimemo\u2019s claim of innocence based on stabbing contradicts the evidences showing stabbing caused death and that Menimemo wielded the murder weapon.\n\nTherefore, between Menimemo\u2019s Testimony 0 and Evidence 0 (or 7), there is a contradiction.\n\nHence the contradictory pair is:\n"

It sports a very strong lock, especially with Mr Shamspeare in mind. The attached coin box sports a very strong lock, and there is a tiny hole in its base.\"\n\nTestimony 3: \"The meter doesn't appear to have been tampered with, though, and the collection agent has the only key.\" (Person: Altamont)\n\nTestimony 6: \"Somehow, he's usin' all the flamin' gas he wants without payin' a penny! If that's not thievin', what is?!\" (Person: Metermann)\n\nTestimony 2 states that the meter \"didn't have a single coin in it!\"\n\nTestimony 4 says: \"All joints on the meter are welded shut, and the lock is made from solid steel. There's no way to dismantle it.\" (Person: Altamont)\n\nTestimony 5 says the meter only accepts coins of the exact diameter and thickness of a thruppenny bit; nothing else will fit.\n\nThere is a contradiction between Testimony 3 (\"The meter doesn't appear to have been tampered with\") and Testimony 6 (\"Somehow, he's usin' all the flamin' gas he wants without payin' a penny!\"). If the meter hasn't been tampered with and there's no coin inside, how is Mr Shamspeare using gas?\n\nSimilarly, Evidence 8 notes the meter is strongly locked with a small hole in the base. If the lock is strong and the body welded shut, misuse should be impossible.\n\nThus, the contradiction is between the testimony \"The meter doesn't appear to have been tampered with\" (Testimony 3) and the evidence that Mr Shamspeare is using gas without paying (implied by Testimony 6 and the empty meter in Testimony 2).\n\nThe direct contradiction lies between Testimony 3 and Testimony 6; however, the question requests a pair of evidence and testimony.\n\nBetween Evidence 8 (description of strongly locked meter that cannot be dismantled) and Testimony 6 (claiming gas is used without payment), there is a conflict. The evidence says the meter cannot be tampered with, yet the testimony claims unpaid gas usage.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction pair is: Evidence 8 and Testimony 6.\n"

And crashed into the Crystal Tower!\"\n\nEvidence 10 (Wooden 'Birdcage') states that the cage crashed down into the Crystal Tower.\n\nNo problem there.\n\nHowever, Evidence 5 (Photograph of the Victim) shows the victim after he had ostensibly been 'beamed' to the Crystal Tower - with a stab wound to the chest.\n\nEvidence 6 (Autopsy Report) states that the victim was stabbed in the chest and had a broken neck from the violent fall.\n\nTestimony 5 by Gina says: \"I didn't get a good look inside the cage, but no one went near it after it crashed into the tower.\"\n\nThis may contradict the autopsy indicating a stab wound inflicted before or during the fall, but that is not a direct contradiction.\n\nNow, focusing on Evidence 17 (Post-Explosion Photograph): It shows the experimentation stage completely levelled by a time bomb.\n\nTestimony 1 from Gina says: \"There's this huge bang from the stage, and then the next second, another bang in the sky beside us.\"\n\nIf the explosion was from the stage (first bang) and then the balloon (second bang), as Gina says, it matches Evidence 17.\n\nNow, look at Evidence 3 (Mysterious Contraption \u2192 Crossbow), a weapon found hidden behind a tree under the experimentation stage, belonging to Mr. Enoch Drebber.\n\nHowever, no testimony mentions or denies the presence of the crossbow, so no contradiction there.\n\nEvidence 4 (Piece of Green Cloth), a torn canvas-like material with scorch marks found under the experimentation stage, possibly from the balloon.\n\nTestimony 3 from Gotts says the explosion was from the green balloon, which fits with the cloth.\n\nNow focusing on the position of the victim.\n\nEvidence 10 says the wooden cage crashed down with the victim inside, damaging the Crystal Tower. Testimony 4 (Lune) matches this.\n\nHowever, Evidence 6 (Autopsy Report) states the victim's neck was broken from the fall and was stabbed in the chest.\n\nEvidence 7 (Screwdriver) matches the shape of the victim's stab wound and has blood traces, indicating the weapon used.\n\nHowever, evidence indicates the victim was stabbed, but no testimony mentions anyone stabbing the victim.\n\nNot a contradiction, but an omission.\n\nEvidence 12 (Camera) is from a waxwork from Madame Tusspells, associated with Drebber.\n\nThere is no testimony contradicting that.\n\nFocus on the contradictions between testimonies and evidence:\n\nTranscript of Testimony 3 (Gotts): \"It voz not ze sky zat exploded. It voz a green balloon zat woz next to ours at ze time.\"\n\nEvidence 17 (Post-Explosion Photograph) shows the experimentation stage was completely levelled by a time bomb, an explosion that destroyed the stage.\n\nIf the explosion took out the stage, then it was certainly not just a balloon.\n\nTestimony 3 specifically says it was the balloon that exploded, implicitly denying that the stage exploded.\n\nTherefore, Testimony 3 (Gotts) contradicts Evidence 17.\n\nHence, the pair is Evidence 17 and Testimony 3.\n"

It goes off like a gunshot.\"\n\nTestimony 1 implies the noise they heard (the \"big bang\") was a gunshot by the Reaper, but Evidence 14 suggests that the firecracker could have caused a similar noise.\n\nHowever, this is not necessarily a contradiction; it is possible that the big bang was the firecracker, not a gunshot.\n\nLooking deeper, Testimony 4 (Gossip) says: \"I slipped over and got blood on my hand, so I quickly wiped it off on the floor.\"\n\nEvidence 13 (Noticeboard) mentions: \"There is a bloody handprint on the back side.\"\n\nTestimony 4 reveals someone admitting they wiped blood on the floor, which explains the bloody handprint on the noticeboard (Evidence 13), so no contradiction.\n\nTestimony 3 (Gossip) states: \"I ran into the room and there he woz. The Reaper, gun in hand, standin' over the dead body!\"\n\nEvidence 11 (Autopsy Report) says death was instant from a bullet at close range, with no mention of multiple gunshots or a struggle.\n\nTestimony 0 (Gossip) says: \"We saw the whole thing from start to finish, we did. Everything from the moment they went in the building.\"\n\nTestimony 2 (Sandwich) says: \"Seems to m-me that quick-to-talk is quick-to-walk. Gossip couldn't wait to go and see what had happened.\"\n\nNo clear contradiction detected here in these testimonies.\n\nLooking at Evidence 11 (Autopsy Report) and Testimony 1 (Venus):\n\nVenus says the big bang was less than a minute after the Reaper went inside, implying the gunshot happened instantly after arrival.\n\nHowever, Evidence 11 states that an accurate estimation of the time of death is not possible.\n\nSo these don't contradict either.\n\nNow focusing on Testimony 5 (Venus): \"I was scared 'alf to death, me. So I ran off to find a copper.\"\n\nIf this is true, why does Testimony 0 say \"we saw the whole thing from start to finish\"?\n\nGossip claims to have seen the whole thing, but Venus ran off immediately after the big bang.\n\nThis is not necessarily a contradiction; \"we\" can still include both of them, or Gossip could be lying.\n\nNow, look at Evidence 16 (Gregson's Pocket Watch): \"It's no longer ticking and the glass over the face is cracked. Having wound it up, it's started ticking again.\"\n\nEvidence 26 (Small Component) says the missing 'crown' of the pocket watch was found later.\n\nNo contradiction here.\n\nLooking at Evidence 17 (Inspector's Identification): \"The identification of a man claiming to be a detective inspector, confiscated by Mr de Rousseau and Mr de Rossi.\"\n\nTestimony 3 (Gossip) states the Reaper had a gun, but the identity of the Reaper is unclear from these testimonies and evidence.\n\nNo contradiction.\n\nNow look carefully at Testimony 1 by Venus (the bang), and Evidence 11 (Autopsy Report) stating \"Death was instant, resulting from a bullet shot at close range.\"\n\nTestimony 1 implies the big bang was made by the Reaper, but Evidence 14 suggests it was a firecracker.\n\nAlso, the firecracker goes off like a gunshot.\n\nHence there is a contradiction: the big bang heard was presumed to be a gunshot (Testimony 1, Venus), but the noise may have been a firecracker (Evidence 14).\n\nThe contradiction is between the testimony of Venus and the actual evidence about the firecracker.\n\nTherefore, the contradictory pair is Evidence 14 (Venus Firecracker) and Testimony 1 (Venus).\n"

The photograph seems to show the victim clearly, but De Rousseau and De Rossi claim the man who claimed to be the inspector was not the real man, implying that the victim was impersonated. \n\nAdditionally, the red hairpiece found on the victim's head suggests that the victim may have been wearing a disguise, which supports the testimonies by De Rousseau and De Rossi and contradicts the photograph that looks like the actual Inspector Gregson, or rather the assumption that the victim was who he claimed to be.\n\nTherefore, Evidence 15 (photograph showing the victim with red hairpiece) and Testimony 0 (De Rousseau claiming the man was an imposter) contradict each other.\n"

It's no longer ticking and the glass over the face is cracked. Having wound it up, it's started ticking again.\" So the watch was broken but wound up again.\n\nEvidence 26, Small Component, says it's the missing \"crown\" of Inspector Gregson's pocket watch, found in Jigoku's cabin. So Jigoku was indeed in possession of the broken watch piece.\n\nHowever, Testimony 4: \"The inspector was clearly killed having returned to Britain.

A 'kimono', I think it's called.\" This contradicts Vigil's testimony that they couldn't find the papers.\n\nThus, there is a contradiction between Vigil's statement that they couldn't find the Asogi Papers in the cell and Caidin's statement that the document was found in the folds of a robe left in the cell.\n\nTherefore, the pair that contradict each other is Evidence 19 and Testimony 4.\n"

            "reasoning": "Let's analyze the evidences and testimonies to find at least one contradiction.\n\nEvidence 2 (Crime Scene Notes) states that the body was found at 6:15 AM inside the elevator stopped at the first floor lounge and that the victim was hit on the back of his head. The autopsy report, Evidence 13, supports this.\n\nEvidence 9 (Ms. Meele's Testimony) states that Mr. Akbey Hicks was in his seat when the plane took off again at 5 AM. Mr. Hicks could not have been in his seat at 5 AM and then be found dead at 6:15 AM in the elevator, especially as the elevator was on the first floor lounge, meaning the plane must have landed or at least been on the ground.\n\nTestimonies 1 and 3, both from Meele, claim that from 3 to 4 and from 5 to 6 she was alone in the flight attendants\u2019 room. This contradicts evidence that Mr. Hicks was in his seat at 5 AM (as stated by Meele herself in testimony 9) while Meele claims to be alone from 5 to 6 in the attendants\u2019 room (testimony 3). Meele cannot be alone in the attendants' room and have seen Mr. Hicks at his seat at 5 AM.\n\nThus, Meele's testimony that she was alone in the flight attendants' room from 5 to 6 contradicts her testimony that Mr. Hicks was in his seat at 5 AM. The question asks for one pair of evidence and testimony that contradict, however, because the contradiction is between two testimonies or between evidence and testimony, and testimony 9 is considered an evidence\u2014Ms. Meele's testimony in evidence 9 versus testimony 3: Meele's statement about being alone from 5 to 6.\n\nGiven that Evidence 9 is Ms. Meele's statement and Testimony 3 is also from Meele, this is less clear.\n\nBut if we consider the contradiction between Evidence 9 (Ms. Meele's statement that Mr. Hicks was at his seat at 5 AM) and Testimony 3 (Meele states she was alone in flight attendants' room from 5 to 6) - Meele stating she was alone and Mr. Hicks being in his seat at 5 AM would be contradictory if Meele saw him.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 10 (GoYou Suitcase) was used to transport the body, the bloody cloth found inside was stained with blood, and the autopsy report states the victim died from a blow to the back of the head. Meele's testimony (1 and 3) claims she was alone in the flight attendants\u2019 room during the relevant times, meaning she had opportunity to move the body. So the key contradiction is in Meele stating she was alone when perhaps she shouldn't be.\n\nTherefore, the clearest contradiction is between Evidence 9 (Ms. Meele's statement that Mr. Hicks was in his seat at 5 AM) and Meele's own Testimony 3 (saying she was alone in flight attendants' room from 5 to 6), as Meele cannot see Mr. Hicks in his seat at 5 AM if she was alone in the flight attendants' room.\n"

It's capable of firing blanks.\"\n\nEvidence 15: Revolver used to kill Deacon was originally stolen from guard by victim during escape.\n\nThis implies the victim got a gun despite restrictions.\n\nThis is a minor contradiction but more of elaboration.\n\nBest contradiction is between Testimony 4 and Evidence 6:\n\nTestimony 4 claims Meekins killed Deacon in garage.\n\nEvidence 6 says little blood at body site, implying body was moved.\n\nThis suggests that the shooting location and murder location differ, contradicting Testimony 4.\n\nTherefore, the evidence and testimony contradict on the location and circumstances of death.\n"

            "reasoning": "Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies in detail.\n\nEvidence 15 is a Revolver, described as the weapon used to kill Oliver Deacon, and it was originally stolen by the victim during his prison escape. Evidence 11, the Colin Devorae Dossier, states that Colin Devorae (Oliver Deacon) is right-handed.\n\nTestimony 0 by Lance claims that there are fingerprints on the murderous gun. Testimony 1 claims those fingerprints prove that Lolli killed Oliver. But Lolli is not introduced in characters, yet is referred to by Lance. More importantly, if the killer was Lolli, then why would the revolver be originally stolen by the victim himself as in Evidence 15?\n\nFurthermore, the evidences suggest that the victim was shot from ABD (probably the abdomen), through the shoulder, and the body was moved (Evidence 6). The Blue Badger's costume was stolen by Lauren Paups (Evidence 5), and the Bad Badger costume was worn by Oliver Deacon (Evidence 5). It's stated that the gunpowder burn is proof the victim was shot at point blank (Evidence 9), possibly suggesting the victim was killed with his own gun.\n\nSince Lance says the fingerprints prove Lolli killed Oliver, but the gun is originally stolen by Oliver himself, this might contradict the testimony.\n\nAlternatively, the testimonies themselves do not contradict each other, as they are arranged in a logical sequence supporting Lolli as the killer.\n\nLooking for a stronger contradiction:\n\nEvidence 6 says \"Victim, Deacon, shot from ABD through shoulder\", but Evidence 9 says \"Gunpowder burn is proof he was shot from point blank.\" Now, usually, a gunpowder burn suggests a shot from very close range, but \"through shoulder\" suggests the bullet's trajectory, so no contradictions there.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 15 says Revoiver used to kill Deacon was stolen by victim during escape.\n\nTestimony 0 states \"There are fingerprints on that murderous gun.\" It's not specified whose fingerprints.\n\nTestimony 1 says \"And they prove that it was Lolli who killed Oliver.\"\n\nIf the gun was stolen by the victim himself, and the fingerprints show Lolli's, it contradicts the ownership and origin of the revolver?\n\nAlternatively, this might be consistent.\n\nAnother possible contradiction:\n\nEvidence 5 says \"Stolen Costumes: Blue, Proto and Bad Badger. Blue Badger = Lauren Paups, Proto Badger = Lance Amano, Bad Badger = Oliver Deacon.\"\n\nEvidence 6 says \"Victim: Oliver Deacon. He was shot dead. ... The body was moved.\"\n\nTestimony 1 says that Lolli killed Oliver.\n\nBut no Lolli is listed in Characters; so Lance is testifying about a person not listed.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 13 says \"Missing Model Gun: was ripped from the Bad Badger costume, capable of firing blanks.\"\n\nIf the killing weapon was a real revolver (Evidence 15), but there's a missing model gun ripped from the costume used for blanks (Evidence 13), this may contradict testifying that the killing was by someone wielding a model gun (not real).\n\nPerhaps the key discrepancy is between Evidence 13 (missing model gun capable of firing blanks) and Evidence 15 (revolver used to kill Deacon).\n\nIf the model gun is missing and the fatal shot was from a real revolver, then the person stealing model gun didn't kill, or the killer used the real revolver, contradicting scenarios involving the model gun.\n\nHowever, none of the testimonies mention a model gun or blanks explicitly.\n\nAlternatively, focusing on the testimonies:\n\nTestimony 3: \"So Mr. Edgeworth, even you must see that Lolli was only acting in self-defense.\"\n\nIf Lolli was acting in self-defense, then killing might be justified.\n\nBut the evidence shows shooting from abdomen through the shoulder (which is unusual for self-defense), indicating possibly an execution-type shooting.\n\nTherefore, Testimony 3 contradicts preliminary findings (Evidence 6) that the victim was shot from abdomen through the shoulder, not a typical self-defense shot.\n\nHence the biggest contradiction is between Evidence 6 (victim shot through abdomen and shoulder) and Testimony 3 (claiming self-defense).\n"

This does not directly contradict but the key contradiction lies more in the details of how the deaths occurred.\n\nTestimony 0 states \"There's no one out there with a motive to kill both Mr. Faraday and Mr. Rell,\" whereas the evidence indicates that both men were victims in a case with motives being examined.\n\nTestimony 1 says \"All you really have to establish is that someone had a grudge against one of the two men,\" implying there is motive. So the first testimony and the first contradict.\n\nBut more strongly, Evidence 2 \"Det. Gumshoe's Testimony\" states \"Other than gunshot, didn't hear a sign of a struggle.\"\n\nHowever, Evidence 5 says Faraday had stab wounds to chest, which would imply a struggle.\n\nTherefore, no signs of struggle heard but a stabbing occurred.\n\nHence, Evidence 2 (Det. Gumshoe's Testimony) and Evidence 5 (Crime Scene Notes) contradict - in testimony and evidence format.\n\nAmong testimonies, no testimony explicitly claims no struggle.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is:\n\nEvidence 2 (Det. Gumshoe's Testimony): \"Other than gunshot, didn't hear a sign of a struggle.\"\n\nEvidence 5 (Crime Scene Notes): \"Faraday died of a knife stab to the chest.\" This suggests a struggle, yet the detective heard no sign.\n\nTherefore,\n\n{\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 2} would be invalid as testimony 2 is by Yew about Rell witnessing murder.\n\nThe only testimony related to hearing/no hearing is Evidence 2, which is called Det. Gumshoe's Testimony but labeled as evidence.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 10 is Det. Badd's Testimony: He heard the gunshot.\n\nHence, the only contradiction is between Det. Gumshoe's statement \"didn't hear a sign of struggle\" (Evidence 2) and the fact the victim died due to stabbing (Evidence 5), which implies there was some struggle.\n\nHowever, since Det. Gumshoe's \"testimony\" is under Evidence 2, and we don't have a direct testimony contradicting it in the testimonies, no direct contradiction between evidence and testimony except for the possibility that Testimony 3 contradicts the origin of the gunshot as stated in the evidence.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 3 \"Handgun\" states bullet that killed Rell fired from a few yards away.\n\nTestimony 2 and 3 are by Nosa in the example, but in this case we don't have Nosa.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 0 \"There's no one with a motive to kill both,\" and Evidence 5, which is the crime scene notes indicating motive existed.\n\nTherefore,\n"

This aligns that a crossbow arrow was launched.\n\nTestimony 1 says, \"Even if you fired the arrows from this side, they wouldn't go far with a statue tied to them!\" implying that it's impossible for arrows to be shot with a heavy statue attached.\n\nTestimony 2 counters this by asking, \"If it wasn't a statue that was tied to the arrows, then what did the crossbow launch...?\" indicating that something was launched by the crossbow which could not have been the statue.\n\nTestimony 3 states, \"I don't think I need to tell you that the Primidux Statue didn't sprout wings.\" reinforcing the idea that the statue could not have flown.\n\nSo, Testimony 1 states the arrows wouldn't go far with a statue tied (disproving the arrows could have been launched with a statue), while Testimony 2 questions what launched if not a statue, suggesting something was indeed launched with the arrows. This is contradictory.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 1 and Testimony 2.\n\nThe evidence about the arrows being actual crossbow arrows supports the question raised in Testimony 2, while Testimony 1 denies that.\n\nHence, the pair that contradict each other is Evidence 30 and Testimony 1 or Testimony 2 \u2014 but the question asks for one evidence and one testimony pair.\n\nEvidence 30 supports the arrow launch. Testimony 1 contradicts this by saying arrows wouldn't go far if tied to a statue.\n\nThus the contradictory pair is Evidence 30 and Testimony 1.\n"

However, Evidence 3 states that the cause of death (COD) was a single stab to the base of the neck and that the body was not badly burnt by fire, and Evidence 35 states the murder weapon was visible in Mr. Alba's bouquet in the photo, suggesting the knife was present there during the murder. But Testimony 1 claims Alba left the bouquet in the theater and anyone could have taken the knife from there, which contradicts the assertion that Alba personally used the knife to kill Coachen.\n\nBetween these, the clearest contradiction lies between Alba\u2019s claim of killing Coachen with the knife stuck in his bouquet (Testimony 0) and Alba's other statement (Testimony 1) that he left that bouquet in the theater and someone else could have taken the knife, implying he did not use it. These two testimonies contradict each other, but the prompt requests to identify contradiction between an evidence and a testimony.\n\nLooking further, the crucial contradiction involves Testimony 2 and Evidence 3: Testimony 2 states that Coachen's body was discovered in Babahl, while Evidence 3 describes the body and the COD but does not say where the body was found outside referring to the theater originally. Additionally, Testimony 3 insists there is no way Alba could have transported the body from the theater to Babahl, implying the body was found in Babahl which contradicts the possibility that the body was at the theater.\n\nBut the strongest contradiction is between Testimony 0 (Alba admitting to killing Coachen with the knife in his bouquet) and Evidence 11 (DeMasque II's Note), which shows the note requesting the theft of the Primidux Statue, handwriting matching Coachen's, indicating Coachen's involvement unrelated to Alba's stabbing claim. But this is indirect.\n\nMaybe a clearer contradiction is between Testimony 2 (Coachen's body was discovered in Babahl) and Evidence 36 (Security Footage), which shows Steel Samurai pushing a pushcart into Babahl from the dressing room and that there was blood inside. If Coachen died in the theater, but the body was found in Babahl, someone transported the body, contradicting Testimony 3 (Alba\u2019s claim he could not have moved the body). So Testimony 3 contradicts Evidence 36.\n\nTherefore, the direct contradiction is between:\n\nEvidence 36: Security footage showing a person pushing a pushcart into Babahl from the dressing room with blood inside - suggesting the body was moved to Babahl.\n\nTestimony 3: Alba states he could not have transported the body from the theater to Babahl.\n\nHence, Evidence 36 and Testimony 3 contradict each other.\n"

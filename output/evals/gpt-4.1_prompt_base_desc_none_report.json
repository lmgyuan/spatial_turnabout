However, sticking purely to Testimony 3 and Evidence 2:\n\nIf the body evidence shows signs of life at the time Sahwit claims he screamed about a dead man (for example, postmortem interval timing, body warmth, etc.), that would contradict his testimony. This is a common contradiction used to catch someone lying about when and how they discovered a victim.\n\nExplanation: Testimony 3 states Sahwit let out a scream at the sight of Mr. Knight's dead body.

If an evidence explicitly proves nothing red was visible, that would be a contradiction. Alternatively, is there an evidence that proves Kay could not have been in that position or could not have seen the color red at all?\n\nLooking at Evidence 8: \"Kay's Recollections.\" If Kay's recollections is an evidence stating that Kay can't remember anything at all, then this directly contradicts her testimony in number 3, where she says she remembers seeing something red.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Testimony 2:\nTestimony: ...I just can't remember.

However, Evidence 7 (\"Taurusaurus Head\") and Evidence 8 (\"Taurusaurus Plushie\") both relate to \"monster costume.\" But, \"Monster Footprints\" (Evidence 6) could show activity relating to a monster costume at the crime scene.\n\nBut, Testimony 3 (\"Inside that monster costume over there...\") is a claim about where the body was hidden.\n\nIf I look for a contradiction, perhaps there is Security Camera Footage (Evidence 10), showing that nothing entered or exited the costume\u2014or perhaps something else.\n\nBut with only these testimonies and evidence, let's focus on \"Movie Set Locks\" (Evidence 4). Testimony 1 says \"If Shaun was an accomplice, the problem with the locks would be resolved.\" This refers to the Movie Set Locks (Evidence 4), which could contradict the testimony.\n\nSo, is there a contradiction between the Monster Footprints (Evidence 6) and the testimony that the body was hidden inside the monster costume? Testimony 3 says the body was inside the costume, but if the Monster Footprints (Evidence 6) show something else (like the costume had not moved, or only one set of footprints, etc), that would be a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction would be:\n\nEvidence 6 (Monster Footprints): These show only one set of prints, or perhaps show that the costume did not move from a certain location.\n\nTestimony 3: \"Inside that monster costume over there...\" -- If the costume was unmoved, or the footprints don't match, these two would contradict each other.\n\nSo my answer is:\n"

Bust (evidence 15) represents something that could be lifted using upper body strength, contrary to Acro's claim in testimony 3.\n\nThus, the contradiction lies between Evidence 15 (\"Max G.

If Andrews claims to have poured herself a glass (and drunk from it or handled it), then there should be fingerprints.\n\nThis is a classic contradiction: If Andrews handled the glass, her fingerprints would be present, but there are none.\n\nIn summary: Testimony 4 (\"I poured myself a glass of juice\") is contradicted by Evidence 8 (\"Wine Glass\"), which lacks fingerprints.\n"

If the Stage Pistol is a prop and could not have fired a lethal bullet (as established in some trials), Testimony 3 is contradicted by Evidence 20.\n\nSo, the contradiction, in summary: Gumshoe claims the fatal bullet was fired from the pistol found at the scene, but the Stage Pistol is a prop incapable of firing real bullets.\n"

The \"Tenma Taro Warding Charm\" (Evidence 2) is a charm typically used to ward off Tenma Taro, the supposed yokai. If such a charm were present at the scene, it could suggest someone was trying to ward off the yokai, not frame the killing as a yokai attack. However, that's more supporting than contradicting.\n\nOn the other hand, \"Jinxie's Statement\" (Evidence 12) is often a witness's direct account, and could contradict claims about the feathers and tracks being planted by Mayor Tenma. If Jinxie's Statement asserts a different sequence of events or identifies another person as responsible for the feathers and tracks, it would directly contradict Testimony 3.\n\nAlternatively, \"Crime Scene Photo\" or \"Diagram\" could serve as objective proof\u2014if either shows that the feathers/tracks couldn't have been planted by Mayor Tenma (for example, if he was unconscious or elsewhere at the time), they would contradict the testimony.\n\nHowever, among the given evidence, \"Jinxie's Statement\" is most likely a contradiction if it claims the feathers/tracks were not planted or that Mayor Tenma didn't do it.\n\nThus, the best-match pair is:\n"

The Tenma Taro Warding Charm is an item used to ward off the \"evil\" Tenma Taro yokai\u2014it's a physical item that embodies superstition (See also: Village Superstitions, Evidence 16). If L'Belle is stating he will \"expose the truth behind Tenma Taro,\" this implies he believes there's a hidden or fraudulent side to the legend. However, the existence of the Tenma Taro Warding Charm as evidence shows the superstitious belief is deeply ingrained and physically manifested in the village, directly contradicting the idea that it could be \"exposed\" as just a fraud by an individual declaration.\n\nSo, the testimony that L'Belle can expose the truth (implying the Tenma Taro legend is false or fabricated) contradicts the physical evidence of the charm, which demonstrates how seriously the yokai legend is taken.\n"

If the captain was thrown high into the water from such a height, the body would be expected to exhibit injuries consistent with a huge impact or blunt force trauma all over, possibly broken bones, obvious trauma, or similar evidence.\n\nIf the photo shows the body doesn't match these expectations (for example, no major trauma, different cause of death, or evidence hinting at drowning or poisoning and not being bashed), it directly contradicts Marlon Rimes' claim about the manner of death.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 2 (Photo of the Body) and Testimony 3.\n"

But the question says pick one pair.\n\nLooking carefully, Testimony 4 claims the doctor \"likely stole it from the Atishon residence.\" If the \"Orb Transfer Agreement\" (Evidence 6) exists as proof of a legal transfer, then that directly contradicts the claim of theft\u2014it shows Dr. Buff didn't steal it but received it through an agreement.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 6 (Orb Transfer Agreement) and Testimony 4 (he likely stole it from the Atishon residence).\n"

Let's check the evidence for anything relating to the crime scene, possible witness photos, diagrams, or autopsy showing alternative movement.\n\nEvidence 3: Study Photo  \nEvidence 4: Study Diagram\n\nBut specifically, Evidence 17: Tomb Crime Photo, and Evidence 4: Study Diagram could show the layout or who could have exited which way.\n\nHowever, Evidence 12: Robbery Report could suggest something that contradicts the nature or time of exit. But none specify the door used except possibly the Study Diagram.\n\nBut let's look at Testimony 1 as well: \"I passed by the doctor's house... and that's when I saw Mr. Are'bal.\" Coupled with Evidence 13: Dr. Buff's Autopsy Report, if the time of death is before what Atishon stated as seeing Are'bal, that is a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 4: \"I had no idea Dr. Buff was dead. That's why I didn't call the police.\" with Evidence 13: Dr. Buff's Autopsy Report. If the report gives a time of death well before, and Atishon's statements about time contradict that, or if there's evidence Atishon was in fact aware of the death.\n\nBut focusing on the most direct contradiction:\n\nTestimony 3 (\"He was running out the front door.\") can be contradicted by Evidence 4: Study Diagram, if the diagram or crime scene photo shows it's impossible or the path doesn't make sense.\n\nTherefore, based on the context from Ace Attorney-style logic, the statement that Mr. Are'bal was running out the front door is undercut by the study diagram (Evidence 4) which proves he couldn't be seen running out the front door from where Atishon was.\n"

            "reasoning": "The testimony in Testimony 3 is: \"But I went against his order. I tore the page out of his notebook, and hid the body.\"\nNichody claims to have torn the page from Sorin's notebook.\n\nIf we look at the evidence list:\nEvidence 18 is \"Sorin's Notebook.\"\nIf Sorin's Notebook exists as evidence, then for it to contradict this testimony, the notebook should still contain the page (i.e., the incriminating page is present), or the notebook should be intact and not missing a page, which contradicts Nichody's statement that he tore it out.\n\nAlternatively, let's check for any other serious contradiction. Evidence 13, \"Photo of Hold,\" shows what was in the hold. Testimony 4, \"In the hold, I hid the still-warm body in the spare Pegabull lantern,\" from Nichody, claims he hid the body in the lantern.\n\nIf the Photo of the Hold (Evidence 13) doesn't show this, or shows the hold empty or inconsistent with the body being in the lantern, then there is a contradiction. But since we don't have that detail, it's less direct than the notebook contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 5 also repeats the notebook detail, saying, \"I tore the page out of that notebook in order to protect Master Sorin.\" Again, if the page is not missing or there is no evidence of torn pages from Sorin's Notebook, that's a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the most direct contradiction is between Sorin's Notebook (Evidence 18) and Testimony 3 (\"I tore the page out of his notebook, and hid the body.\"). If Sorin's Notebook is submitted as intact and does not have a missing page, then this directly contradicts the testimony.\n"

My tea was completely harmless! He couldn't have locked the door behind me otherwise, could he?\"\n\nThis is Soseki arguing that the tea could not be poisoned, because the victim would not have been able to lock the door after he left otherwise.\n\nGregson counters in Testimony 3 that strychnine does not kill immediately; the victim could have locked the door even if he'd been poisoned. \n\nSo, Testimony 2 (Soseki) and Testimony 3 (Gregson) are in direct contradiction to each other regarding the effect and timing of the poison.\n\nBut you asked for a contradiction between a testimony and a piece of evidence.\n\nLook at Evidence 3: \"Pair of Teacups.\" This suggests that both characters drank from the teacups, and could be tested for poison. If both cups tested negative for poison, it might contradict the theory that the tea was poisoned.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 7: \"Victim's Medical Report\" might indicate the time or inability for the victim to move or lock the door after poisoning, which could contradict Testimony 3 (Gregson) if, for example, the medical report shows very rapid onset.\n\nGiven the context, Testimony 3 (Gregson: \"Strychnine takes some time...\") could be contradicted by the Victim's Medical Report (Evidence 7) if the report indicates immediate or very rapid death after poisoning.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is most likely between Evidence 7 (Victim's Medical Report) and Testimony 3 (Gregson).\n"

Testimony 5 by Portsman: \"...more probable that she was the one who faked the dying message.\" This claim is that Maggey faked the dying message, but if there is evidence (e.g., handwriting analysis, or timing) within the Note Left by Victim (Evidence 8) that indicates it could only have been written by the victim, or at a time when Maggey wasn't present, then this note would directly contradict Portsman's assertion.\n\nThus, the best clear contradiction is:\n\nTestimony 5: \"Making it all the more probable that she [Maggey Byrde] was the one who faked the dying message.\"\nEvidence 8: Note Left by Victim.\n\nHence:"

However, let's also note Evidence 30: Hair Sticks \u2192 Crossbow Arrows, which indicates that something was launched by crossbow arrows.\n\nLang's other testimonies worry about what could have been launched by a crossbow.\n\nGiven all this, if the assumption is that the Primidux Statue did not move (Testimony 3), but the evidence of crossbow arrows (Evidence 30) and the mechanism is present, there is a contradiction if someone claims the statue moved/flew (as in, \"didn't sprout wings\").\n\nBut a more direct contradiction is between Testimony 1: \"Even if you fired the arrows from this side, they wouldn't go far with a statue tied to them!\" (Implies a statue was attempted to be sent flying by crossbow) and Evidence 30, which proves arrows (maybe related to hair sticks/crossbow arrows) could have launched something else (not the heavy statue).\n\nBut since you request one evidence and one testimony, the clearest pair is:\n\nTestimony 3: \"I don't think I need to tell you that the Primidux Statue didn't sprout wings.\" (i.e., it could not have flown on its own)\nEvidence 25: Photo of Yatagarasu \u2014 but that's just a photo, not related.\nEvidence 30: Hair Sticks \u2192 Crossbow Arrows, which relate to the actual mechanism.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between the assertion that the Primidux Statue couldn't have \"sprouted wings\" (Testimony 3) and Evidence 30, which suggests something was launched with crossbow arrows (possibly giving the illusion of flight/movement across distances).\n\nSo the answer is:\n"

The evidence "Tres Bien Floor Plans" (Evidence 11) and the testimony "The view from the entrance is obstructed and could only see the patio." (Testimony 0) contradict each other.

Explanation: The testimony suggests that the view from the entrance is obstructed, but the evidence shows that the floor plans of the restaurant are available, which would have shown the layout of the restaurant, including the location of the tables and the view from the entrance.

The evidence "The Nickel Samurai" (Evidence 2) and the testimony "It was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's "hakama"" (Testimony 3) contradict each other.

Explanation: The testimony suggests that the Jammin' Ninja's button was found in Mr. Engarde's "hakama", implying that it was removed from the costume. However, the evidence "The Nickel Samurai" shows a glossy photo of the Nickel Samurai costume, which is different from the Jammin' Ninja's costume. This suggests that the button may not have been ripped off the Jammin' Ninja's costume at all.

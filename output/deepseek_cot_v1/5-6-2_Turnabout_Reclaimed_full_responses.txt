Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. The goal is to identify one pair where the evidence directly contradicts a testimony.

First, I need to go through each testimony and see if any of the evidence provided can refute it. Let's start by looking at the testimonies given by Norma DePlume.

Testimony 0: She went to the aquarium to see the killer whale. That seems straightforward and not necessarily contradicted by any evidence right away.

Testimony 1: She claims that while watching the orca from the visitor's corridor, it suddenly went crazy. So, she's saying she witnessed the orca acting violently.

Testimony 2: She states she saw the orca bite the victim to death with its mouth and teeth. This is a direct accusation against the orca, Orla.

Testimony 3: She says she reported the incident to the police immediately after witnessing it.

Now, looking at the evidences, I need to check which one could show that her account isn't possible. Let's look at the Security Footage (Evidence 5). The description says it's video showing the orca pool from the visitor's corridor starting at 10 AM. If the footage covers the time when the incident happened and doesn't show the orca attacking, that would contradict DePlume's testimonies 1 and 2. But the problem is, we don't know the exact time of the incident. However, the autopsy report (Evidence 12) states that Shipley's walkie-talkie hasn't been found, which might not directly contradict the testimony. 

Another angle: The autopsy report (Evidence 12) says the cause of death was a brain contusion from blunt force trauma, not bites. Testimony 2 claims the orca bit the victim to death. The autopsy contradicts this because the injuries are from blunt force, not bites. So Evidence 12 (Shipley's Autopsy Report) would contradict Testimony 2. 

But wait, let me check the autopsy report again. It says "instant death from a brain contusion. There are signs of blunt force trauma all over the body." So blunt force, not bites. That directly contradicts DePlume's testimony that the orca used its teeth to kill. Therefore, Evidence 12 contradicts Testimony 2.

Alternatively, looking at Evidence 2, the Photo of the Body, which says it's hard to make out details. But if the photos don't show bite marks, that could also contradict. But the autopsy report is more explicit about the cause of death. So the stronger contradiction is between Testimony 2 and Evidence 12.

Wait, but the question says to output one pair. Let me confirm.

So, Testimony 2 is DePlume claiming the orca bit the victim. Evidence 12's autopsy report states death was from blunt force, not bites. Therefore, they contradict. That's the pair: Evidence 12 and Testimony 2.

But wait, another possibility: the Security Footage (Evidence 5). If the footage shows the orca not attacking, but the testimony says she saw it. However, the evidence description doesn't explicitly state what's on the footage, just that it's video starting at 10 AM. The time of the incident might be before 10 AM. The calendar (Evidence 8) mentions a meeting at 7 AM. If the murder happened before the aquarium opened at 10 AM, then the security footage starting at 10 AM wouldn't capture the event. Therefore, the footage wouldn't contradict the testimony. So the main contradiction is between the cause of death (blunt force) and the testimony of being bitten.

Thus, the correct pair is Evidence 12 (Shipley's Autopsy Report) and Testimony 2 (DePlume's claim of seeing the orca bite the victim).

Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. I need to go through each testimony and check against the evidence to find inconsistencies.

Starting with the testimonies by Rimes. Testimony 0 says he was in the staff room at 10:10 AM. But looking at Evidence 8, the calendar mix-up happened around 10:10 AM when Pearl accidentally took Rimes's calendar. Pearl mentioned she ran into Rimes around 10:15, which implies he wasn't in the staff room at 10:10 because he was with Pearl. Wait, noâ€”Pearl says she first went into the prep room at 10:10, and Rimes had the info desk announce she was lost around 10:15. So if Rimes claims he was in the staff room at 10:10, but Pearl's interaction suggests he was elsewhere, maybe that's a contradiction. But the calendar switch happened around 10:10, which was accidental. If Rimes's calendar was switched with Pearl's at 10:10, maybe he wasn't in the staff room then. But I need to check if there's a direct contradiction.

Looking at Testimony 3: Rimes says the orca knows a spot where people stand to play volleyball. Then Testimony 4: he suggests the orca knocked down stuff and hit the captain. But the evidence about the whistle (Evidence 4) says that Orla can perform one trick per signal and can't do two at once. If the murder involved multiple actions (like knocking things over and hitting the captain), maybe the whistle signals would need multiple commands, which isn't possible. However, Testimony 4 suggests the orca did both, which might conflict with Evidence 4. But maybe the coins are part of the trick. Wait, Evidence 9 is the Bloodstained Coin, part of 300 coins used as a murder weapon. If the coins were part of a trick, but the whistle can only command one trick at a time. So if the orca was commanded to scatter coins (one trick), she couldn't also ram into the captain at the same time. Therefore, Testimony 4 suggests Orla did two actions (knocking down stuff and hitting the captain), which contradicts Evidence 4's statement that Orla can't perform two tricks at once. So the testimony by Rimes (Testimony 4) contradicts Evidence 4. Let me confirm. Evidence 4 says the whistle can command one trick per signal, and Orla can't do two at a time. If the murder required two actions (knocking over objects and striking the victim), that's impossible unless two signals were given. But if there's only one whistle command, then Testimony 4's claim that Orla did both is impossible. Therefore, Testimony 4 contradicts Evidence 4. That's the pair.

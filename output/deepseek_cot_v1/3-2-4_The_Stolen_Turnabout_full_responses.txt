Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let's start by going through the testimonies and cross-referencing them with the evidence.

Testimony 0 is from Atmey saying he first received the request from Lordly Tailor about 20 days ago. The DeMasque's Calling Card (Evidence 5) is addressed to the Security at Lordly Tailor, talking about stealing the urn. But the problem is, the exhibit is the Treasures of Kurain, which is mentioned in the poster (Evidence 2). Wait, maybe there's a timing issue here. Let me check the details of the testimonies and evidences again.

Atmey's Testimony 3 says he sent his card 10 days beforehand. The Calling Card (Evidence 5) was sent before the heist. If he sent the card 10 days before the crime, which happened on October 12th, that would mean the card was sent around October 2nd. But the request from Lordly Tailor was 20 days ago, which would be September 22nd. So maybe the timeline doesn't add up here. But how does that relate to the evidence?

Wait, Testimony 3 says he sent the calling card 10 days beforehand, but the Sacred Urn (Evidence 4) is described as being in a plain pot, and the calling card mentions the "speckled urn," which might refer to the Sacred Urn. However, according to Evidence 21 (Urn Box), there are pink paint stains. The Paint Marks (Evidence 22) mention that when Adrian dropped the urn's box two weeks ago, she knocked over some paint. If the urn was only placed in the box and sent to the warehouse after Atmey received the request 20 days ago (Testimony 0 and 1), but the paint stains happened two weeks ago (which is 14 days), that would be around the same time. Wait, 20 days ago (Testimony 0) would be when Lordly Tailor requested security. Then the urn was boxed and sent to the warehouse (Testimony 1). But the paint stains happened two weeks prior to the crime (October 12th), so two weeks before would be September 28th. But the request was 20 days before, which would be September 22nd. So the timeline here might conflict. If the urn was sent to the warehouse 20 days ago (Testimony 1), but the box was dropped and got paint stains two weeks ago, then the box would have been in the warehouse already when the paint was spilled. But Testimony 2 says Atmey didn't see the urn until the day of the crime. Wait, but the paint on the box would have been there from two weeks ago, so if Atmey sent the calling card 10 days before the crime (October 2nd), then the box was already painted when he sent the card. However, the calling card mentions the "speckled urn," but the Sacred Urn is in a plain pot. The real urn is not speckled, but the box has pink paint. Hmm, maybe that's the contradiction. The calling card refers to the speckled urn, but the actual urn is plain. But the box has pink stains. Wait, but the Sacred Urn's box (Urn Box, Evidence 21) has pink paint stains. So perhaps the calling card's mention of "speckled urn" is referring to the box's appearance, not the urn itself. But since the urn is described as looking like a plain pot, then the "speckled" description would be incorrect. If Atmey sent the calling card 10 days before the crime, he must have known the urn was speckled, but according to Evidence 4, it's a plain pot, so that's a contradiction. Therefore, Atmey's Testimony 3 (sending the card 10 days prior) and Evidence 5 (the calling card's mention of the speckled urn) would contradict because the actual urn isn't speckled, but the box's paint might make it seem so. But how does the paint relate? The paint was added two weeks ago (14 days before the crime on October 12th), which is September 28th. If the urn was sent to the warehouse 20 days ago (September 22nd), then the box was already there. Then when Adrian knocked over the paint two weeks ago, the box got stained. So the box would have been painted pink two weeks before the crime, but the calling card was sent 10 days before (October 2nd). So Atmey, when writing the calling card, would have known about the speckled urn (pink stains on the box?), but according to his Testimony 2, he didn't see the urn until the day of the crime. Therefore, he couldn't have known about the pink paint on the box when he sent the card 10 days prior. Because the box was already in the warehouse, but he didn't see it until the crime day. Therefore, the calling card's mention of "speckled urn" (which refers to the box's paint) would be information he couldn't have known when he sent the card, which contradicts his testimony that he sent the card 10 days prior. So the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (sending the card 10 days prior) and Evidence 5 (the calling card's content). Because if he sent the card 10 days before the crime, but the box's paint was added 14 days before (two weeks), then when he sent the card, the box would have had the pink stains. However, according to his Testimony 2, he didn't see the urn until the day of the crime, meaning he didn't see the box with the pink stains until then. Therefore, he couldn't have known to refer to the "speckled urn" in his calling card sent 10 days prior. Hence, the evidence (calling card) and testimony (Testimony 3) contradict each other.

{"evidence": 5, "testimony": 3}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony from the given lists contradict each other. The user wants just one pair. Let me start by going through each testimony and checking against the evidence.

Testimony 0: Atmey says he had no contact with the victim. Hmm. The evidence related to the victim's death is the autopsy report (Evidence 15), which says cause of death was blunt trauma. Then there's the Shichishito (Evidence 6), which mentions that DeMasque (who was Ron, but also maybe someone else?) knocked Atmey out during the crime with a blow to the back of the head. Wait, if Atmey was knocked out by DeMasque during the crime, but the victim's cause of death is a similar injury, maybe there's a connection here. But Testimony 0 says Atmey had no contact with the victim. But if the Shichishito was used to hit Atmey, but the victim died from a similar blow, maybe there's a link. Wait, the Shichishito was the weapon used to hit Atmey, but the victim's autopsy says cerebral hemorrhage from blunt trauma. So perhaps the same weapon was used on both Atmey and the victim. But Testimony 0 says Atmey had no contact with the victim. But if the victim was killed by the same weapon that was used on Atmey, maybe Atmey was present when the victim was killed. Alternatively, maybe the victim's injury came from a different event. Let me check the evidence again. Evidence 6 states that DeMasque knocked Atmey out during the crime with a blow to the back of the head. So during the crime (the same time as the murder?), DeMasque hit Atmey with the Shichishito. Then the victim, Kane Bullard, died from a blunt trauma. If the Shichishito was used on both Atmey and the victim, that would mean Atmey was present at the scene where the victim was killed, contradicting his testimony of no contact. But wait, the testimony is about contact with the victim. If Atmey was at the crime scene and the victim was there, but he claims no contact, but if the Shichishito was used on both, maybe the same person (DeMasque) attacked both. But how does this relate to Atmey's contact with the victim? Let's think. Atmey says he had no points of contact with the victim. But if the victim was killed at the same time and location where Atmey was knocked out, then perhaps they were in the same place. But does that mean Atmey had contact with the victim? Maybe not directly. Alternatively, perhaps the Shichishito was used to kill the victim, and then used to knock out Atmey. So the Shichishito is the murder weapon. But Evidence 6 says that DeMasque used it to knock out Atmey. So if the victim was killed with the same weapon, then DeMasque might have killed the victim and then hit Atmey. But Atmey's testimony (Testimony 0) is that he had no contact with the victim. But the fact that he was knocked out during the crime (same time as the murder) suggests he was present. However, the testimony is about contact with the victim, not just presence. So maybe the contradiction isn't here. Let me check other testimonies.

Testimony 2: Atmey says Bullard wrote the blackmail letter. Evidence 10 is the blackmail letter, which says it was written by Bullard. Wait, Evidence 10's description says "Written by Bullard. Click here to read." So Testimony 2 is consistent with Evidence 10. So that's not a contradiction.

Testimony 5: Atmey says DeLite killed Bullard. But Evidence 15 says the time of death was 1 AM. Let's see, other evidence like Evidence 7 (camera data at 1 AM) and Evidence 19 (buzzer at 1:02 AM). Ron's key card (Evidence 12) leaves a record when used. If Ron's key card was used at 1 AM, but he was at his part-time job (Evidence 11 says his wallet was found there), maybe there's an alibi. But not sure if that directly contradicts Testimony 5. Hmm.

Testimony 4: Atmey says Bullard mistook Ron as DeMasque. But Evidence 16 (newspaper clipping) mentions that in the first heist, the guard in the photo is Ron DeLite. So if Ron was a guard during the first heist, maybe Bullard thought he was DeMasque. But maybe that's supporting Atmey's claim here. Not a contradiction.

Looking back at Testimony 0: Atmey says he had no contact with the victim. But Evidence 6 says that during the crime, DeMasque (Ron) knocked Atmey out with the Shichishito. So Atmey was at the crime scene, right? The crime is the murder of Kane Bullard. So if the murder happened at the same time, then Atmey was present. But the testimony is about contact with the victim. If Atmey was knocked out during the crime, does that mean he was present when the victim was killed? If so, then he might have been in contact with the victim. But the testimony says he had no contact. But how?

Wait, the victim was found in his safe (Character 12's description). The crime happened at 1 AM. If Atmey was knocked out during the crime, perhaps he was in the vicinity. But the victim's body was in the safe. So unless Atmey interacted with the victim directly, his testimony could still hold. However, Evidence 6 states that DeMasque knocked Atmey out during the crime. So during the same time when the murder occurred. So Atmey was at the crime scene when the murder happened. But Testimony 0 claims he had no contact with the victim. If the victim was killed in the same place where Atmey was knocked out, maybe they were in the same location, but Atmey didn't interact with the victim. However, if the murder weapon (the Shichishito) was used to kill the victim, then the same weapon that hit Atmey. But that would imply that DeMasque (Ron) killed the victim and then attacked Atmey. So Atmey's presence doesn't necessarily mean he had contact with the victim. But Testimony 0 is about contact with the victim, not presence. So maybe there's no direct contradiction here.

Wait, maybe another angle. Evidence 14 is DeMasque's Broach found near the statue. If that's from Atmey's clothing, perhaps he was disguised as DeMasque. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, Testimony 1: Atmey says Bullard mistook who DeMasque was. But Evidence 16's newspaper clipping shows that Ron was the guard in the first heist. If Bullard was blackmailing Ron (Evidence 10), then Bullard thought Ron was DeMasque. So Testimony 1 is consistent with that evidence. No contradiction.

Wait, let me check Testimony 3: Atmey says Bullard harbored a grudge against Ron for betrayal. But Evidence 10 is the blackmail letter from Bullard to Ron, which would support that. So again, consistent.

Hmm. Let me go back to Testimony 0. If Atmey had no contact with the victim, but during the crime he was knocked out by DeMasque, and the victim was killed in the same timeframe, but in a different location? Maybe not. Wait, where was the crime scene? Evidence 3 mentions the statue was moved the night of the crime. Evidence 12 is the key card to the CEO's office. The victim's body was found in his safe (Character 12). So the CEO's office is where the murder happened. The buzzer record (Evidence 19) shows the buzzer in the CEO's office went off at 1:02 AM. The camera data (Evidence 7) went off at 1 AM. So perhaps the crime happened around 1 AM. If Atmey was knocked out by DeMasque (Ron) using the Shichishito (Evidence 6), that would mean Atmey was present at the scene. But the victim was in the CEO's office safe. So unless Atmey was in the CEO's office, he wouldn't have contact. But how did he get knocked out? If the statue was moved (Evidence 3), maybe the statue was in the CEO's office? Or another location. Hmm. This is getting a bit complicated.

Wait, the Shichishito is part of the statue. If the statue was moved, maybe the Shichishito was taken from there. If DeMasque used it to knock out Atmey, perhaps this happened in the vicinity. But the victim was killed in his safe. So if Atmey was in the same building but a different room, he might not have had contact with the victim. But the contradiction would arise if there's evidence that Atmey was in contact with the victim.

Alternatively, maybe the Shichishito was the murder weapon. The autopsy (Evidence 15) says blunt trauma. The Shichishito is a ceremonial sword, which could cause that. If the victim was killed with the Shichishito, which was then used to hit Atmey, then Atmey's testimony that he had no contact with the victim is true, but the murder weapon connects them. But how does that contradict the testimony? Unless the fact that the same weapon was used on both implies that Atmey and the victim were attacked by the same person, but that doesn't directly link Atmey to the victim.

Wait, perhaps another angle. Evidence 6 states that DeMasque knocked Atmey out during the crime with the Shichishito. The crime here refers to the murder of Kane Bullard. So during the same incident, Atmey was knocked out. Therefore, Atmey was present during the crime. If the victim was killed at the same time and place, then Atmey would have been there, which might imply he had contact with the victim. But his testimony (Testimony 0) says he had no points of contact. But being present doesn't necessarily mean contact. Unless "points of contact" refers to any interaction. Wait, the testimony says "no points of contact whatsoever." If Atmey was in the same location when the murder happened, that could be considered a point of contact. Alternatively, if the victim was killed in the CEO's office, and Atmey was knocked out elsewhere, then maybe not. But if the Shichishito was used in the same area where the victim was killed, that could link them.

Alternatively, Evidence 6 says that DeMasque used the Shichishito to knock out Atmey during the crime. The crime here is the murder. So if Atmey was at the scene of the crime (the murder), then he had contact with the location, but not necessarily the victim. However, if the victim was present in the same area when Atmey was knocked out, that might imply contact. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the key is that the Shichishito was bent during the crime. Evidence 6 says the Shichishito "wasn't bent before the crime." So during the crime, it was used to hit Atmey, which could have bent it. But the victim's cause of death is a blunt trauma. If the same Shichishito was used to kill the victim, then Atmey's being hit with it would link him to the crime scene. Therefore, if Atmey was hit with the Shichishito (the murder weapon), that would place him at the crime scene where the victim was killed. But Testimony 0 claims he had no contact with the victim. However, being at the crime scene when the victim was killed might not directly contradict unless he actually interacted with the victim.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me check other possibilities.

Testimony 5: Atmey claims Ron killed Bullard. But if Ron's key card (Evidence 12) was used at the CEO's office, which leaves a record. The buzzer (Evidence 19) went off at 1:02 AM. But if Ron was at his part-time job, his wallet (Evidence 11) was found there. So maybe he wasn't present. If Ron's alibi is that he was at his job, then Testimony 5 would contradict that. But Evidence 11 says the wallet was found at his part-time job's company building on the night of the crime. So maybe he was there, but the key card was used elsewhere. But the key card leaves a record. If the key card was used to enter the CEO's office, but Ron was at his job, maybe someone else used it. But this is getting into alibis, which might not directly contradict Testimony 5. However, this is more about Ron's actions than Atmey's testimony.

Alternatively, looking at Evidence 10 (blackmail letter) written by Bullard to Ron. Testimony 2 says Bullard wrote the letter. So they match. No contradiction.

Wait, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 0 (no contact) and Evidence 6 (Atmey being knocked out during the crime). If during the crime (the murder of Bullard), Atmey was present and knocked out, then he was at the scene, which might mean he had contact with the victim. But the testimony says he had no contact. So if the victim was killed in the same place where Atmey was knocked out, then he was present during the murder, which would be a point of contact. Therefore, Testimony 0 is contradicted by Evidence 6. Because Evidence 6 states that Atmey was attacked during the crime (the same time as the murder), meaning he was present and had contact with the perpetrator (DeMasque), but the testimony says he had no contact with the victim. Wait, but the testimony is about contact with the victim, not the perpetrator. So if Atmey was at the crime scene when the murder happened but didn't interact with the victim, then Testimony 0 could still be true. Unless the Shichishito was used to kill the victim, implying that the perpetrator (DeMasque) used it on both the victim and Atmey. But that would mean the same weapon was used for both, but not necessarily that Atmey had contact with the victim. So maybe there's no contradiction here.

Alternatively, perhaps the time of death. The autopsy (Evidence 15) says time of death was 1 AM. The camera data (Evidence 7) says the warehouse camera went off at 1 AM. The buzzer (Evidence 19) went off at 1:02 AM. If Atmey was knocked out during the crime (around 1 AM), and the victim died at 1 AM, then Atmey was present at the time of death. But again, does that count as contact?

Alternatively, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 4 and Evidence 20. Testimony 4 says that Bullard's mistake is excusable because Ron truly believes he's DeMasque. But Evidence 20 is Ron's testimony stating that from the second heist on, he was stealing under blackmail. If Ron was being blackmailed, then he wasn't acting as DeMasque of his own volition, which might contradict Atmey's claim that Ron truly believes he's DeMasque. But Evidence 20 is Ron's own testimony. If Ron was being blackmailed, he might be committing the thefts under duress, not because he believes he's DeMasque. So Testimony 4 claims that Ron truly believes he's DeMasque, but Ron's Testimony (Evidence 20) says he was blackmailed. This would be a contradiction. However, the user's question is about evidence and testimony contradicting, where testimony is from Atmey. So Evidence 20 is Ron's Testimony, which is a piece of evidence. If Atmey's Testimony 4 says Ron thinks he's DeMasque, but Ron's own testimony (Evidence 20) says he was blackmailed, that would be a contradiction. So Evidence 20 (Ron's Testimony) contradicts Testimony 4 (Atmey's claim). But the user wants the pair of evidence and testimony that contradict. So Evidence 20 and Testimony 4. Let's check:

Evidence 20: Ron's Testimony states that from DeMasque's 2nd heist on, he was stealing as directed by blackmail letters. So Ron was acting under coercion, not because he believed himself to be DeMasque. Atmey's Testimony 4 says that Bullard's mistake is excusable because the defendant (Ron) truly believes he is Mask DeMasque. Therefore, Ron's Testimony (Evidence 20) contradicts Atmey's Testimony 4. So the pair would be evidence 20 and testimony 4. However, I need to check if the user's answer requires this pair. But according to the problem, which evidence and testimony contradict. So in this case, Evidence 20 (Ron's Testimony) contradicts Atmey's Testimony 4. So {"evidence": 20, "testimony":4}.

But wait, let's check the evidence list again. Evidence 20 is Ron's Testimony, which says he was stealing under blackmail. Testimony 4 is Atmey's statement that Ron truly believes he's DeMasque. So if Ron was acting under blackmail, he doesn't believe he's DeMasque; he's being forced. Thus, the contradiction is between these two. So this would be the pair. But the user's instruction is to select one pair, and this seems valid.

Alternatively, another possible contradiction: Testimony 1 says Bullard mistook who DeMasque was. But Evidence 16's newspaper clipping shows that Ron was the guard in the first heist. If DeMasque's first heist involved Ron as a guard, perhaps Bullard thought Ron was DeMasque. But that's supporting Testimony 1, so no contradiction.

Alternatively, Testimony 0 (Atmey no contact) and Evidence 6 (Atmey was knocked out during crime). If the crime is the murder, then Atmey was present during the murder. If the victim was killed then, but Atmey was in the same place, that's a point of contact. But Testimony 0 says no contact. So if Evidence 6 places Atmey at the scene during the murder, that contradicts Testimony 0. But the testimony is about contact with the victim, not presence at the scene. So unless being present implies contact, but contact might mean direct interaction.

Hmm. I think the strongest contradiction is between Evidence 20 (Ron's Testimony) and Testimony 4 (Atmey's claim that Ron believes he's DeMasque). Because if Ron was blackmailed, he's not acting out of belief. So this would contradict Atmey's statement. Thus, the pair is Evidence 20 and Testimony 4. But let me confirm the evidence numbers. Evidence 20 is Ron's Testimony. Testimony 4 is Testimony 4 in the list (index 4?), but the user listed Testimony 0 to 5. Testimony 4: "Mr. Bullard's mistake is quite excusable. The defendant truly believes he is Mask DeMasque." So if Ron's Testimony (Evidence 20) says he was acting under blackmail, that contradicts Testimony 4's claim that he truly believes he's DeMasque. Therefore, this pair is the contradiction.

{"evidence": 20, "testimony": 4}

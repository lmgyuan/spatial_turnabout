Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence contradicts one of the testimonies. Let's start by going through the testimonies given by Stickler. 

Testimony 4 says that the bullet hit the victim in the forehead from the front. But looking at the autopsy report (Evidence 11), the cause of death is a single bullet to the right temple. So the location of the bullet wound is different. The testimony claims the bullet hit the forehead, but the autopsy says right temple. That's a contradiction.

Wait, right temple is on the side of the head, not the front. So if the victim was facing the defendant as per the testimony, a bullet hitting the forehead would be from the front. But the actual wound is on the right temple, which would be a different angle. That seems like a clear contradiction between Testimony 4 and Evidence 11. 

Let me check the other evidence and testimonies to make sure there's no better pair. The pistol (14) had two rounds fired, but the autopsy only mentions one bullet causing death. But maybe that's not a direct contradiction. The slippers (3) have a big toe print, and Alita's sandals (16) also have a big toe print, which might link someone else. But the most direct contradiction is the bullet location. So the correct pair should be Evidence 11 (Autopsy Report) and Testimony 4.

{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 4}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's start by looking through the testimonies and the evidences provided. The goal is to find a contradiction between one of the testimonies and a piece of evidence. 

The testimonies are all from Wesley Stickler (Testimony 0 to 4). Let's go through each one:

Testimony 0: "As soon as the killer raised his pistol, I took action." So Stickler claims he saw the killer raise the pistol and he did something in response.

Testimony 1: He says he told them to stop with composure. He was present and intervened verbally.

Testimony 2: The victim turned towards his voice, then a shot was fired. So the victim moved towards where Stickler was, then got shot.

Testimony 3: The defendant (Wocky) got scared and acted cowardly.

Testimony 4: The killer (defendant) tossed the pistol and fled.

Now, looking at the evidence, especially the ones related to the murder. Let's check the Pistol (Evidence 14): it says two rounds were fired, and fingerprints were wiped. But if Wocky was the killer, his prints should be on the knife (Evidence 10), but the pistol's prints were wiped. However, the knife has Wocky's prints, but the murder was by a bullet (Autopsy Report 11: cause of death is a bullet to the temple). The pistol is the murder weapon, but the prints are wiped. 

Wait, Testimony 4 says the killer tossed the pistol aside. If Wocky is the killer, his prints should be on the pistol, but Evidence 14 says the prints were wiped. However, there's also Evidence 5: Cell Phone found under a car in the clinic garage, which belongs to Wesley Stickler. Maybe he was involved. 

But looking for a contradiction between testimony and evidence. Let's think about Testimony 2: The victim turned towards Stickler's voice when the shot was fired. The autopsy report says the bullet entered the right temple. If the victim turned towards Stickler's voice, the direction of the shot would have to align. But maybe the position of the shooter? Alternatively, considering the location of the crime. The crime happened at the noodle stand (Evidence 12), which the victim was pulling. 

Wait, the victim died pulling the noodle stand. The pistol was left at the scene (Evidence 14). But according to Stickler's testimony, the killer (Wocky) fired a shot when the victim turned towards Stickler's voice. But if the victim was shot in the right temple, the shooter would have to be on the right side. If the victim turned towards Stickler, maybe the shooter was behind him? Not sure yet. 

Alternatively, looking at the slippers (Evidence 3) and Alita's sandals (Evidence 16). Both have a big toe print on the left. The slippers are from the Meraktis Clinic, found at the Kitaki Mansion. Alita's sandals are in the clinic foyer. Maybe someone wearing the slippers or sandals was present. If the killer was wearing these, but Stickler's testimony says the defendant (Wocky) was the killer. But Wocky's chart (Evidence 18) is signed by Alita Tiala. 

Wait, the cell phone (Evidence 5) is Wesley Stickler's. He's the witness. If his phone was found under a car in the clinic garage, maybe he was there. But his testimony says he was at the crime scene. Also, the mirror (Evidence 4) from the car that hit Phoenix was found at Kitaki Mansion and fits the clinic's car. Maybe the car was involved in the crime. 

But back to the contradiction. Let's think about the number of bullets. The Pistol (14) had two rounds fired. The autopsy report says one bullet killed the victim. Where's the other bullet? Evidence 19 is a bullet found in the clinic safe, squished. So one bullet killed Meraktis, another was fired into the safe. If Stickler's testimony says that after the victim turned towards his voice, a shot rang out (Testimony 2), then another shot would have to hit the safe. But Stickler's account doesn't mention a second shot, but the evidence shows two shots. That could be a contradiction. But how does that link to the testimony?

Alternatively, Testimony 3 says the defendant (Wocky) became frightened and Testimony 4 says he tossed the pistol and fled. But according to Wocky's Check-Up Report (Evidence 13), there's a metallic object near his heart. If that's a bullet, maybe he was shot before? But that might not directly contradict.

Wait, the knife (Evidence 10) has Wocky's prints. The murder was via gunshot. So why was the knife there? Maybe the killer tried to use a knife but then shot? But Stickler's testimony doesn't mention a knife. The presence of the knife with Wocky's prints at the crime scene might suggest he was there, but the testimony says he used a pistol. So maybe the knife's presence contradicts the testimony that the killer only used the pistol. But that's not necessarily a contradiction because the testimony doesn't mention the knife. The knife could be unrelated. Hmm.

Another angle: The Pistol (14) has wiped fingerprints, but the knife (10) has Wocky's prints. If Wocky was the killer, why would his prints be on the knife but not the pistol? But the testimony says he used the pistol. So if the knife is at the scene with his prints, but he's supposed to have used the pistol, that's a contradiction. But the testimony doesn't mention the knife. So maybe not directly.

Looking at Testimony 4: the killer tossed the pistol aside. If the pistol was wiped, then the killer must have wiped it. But Wocky, as per testimony, tossed it and fled. He wouldn't have time to wipe prints. So if the pistol was wiped, but according to the testimony, the defendant just tossed it, that's a contradiction. Because the fingerprints should be there if he just tossed it. But the Pistol's description says fingerprints were wiped. So the testimony says he tossed it, implying his prints would be on it, but the evidence says no prints. That's a contradiction. So Testimony 4 (tossing the pistol) and Evidence 14 (pistol's prints wiped) contradict each other. Because if he tossed it immediately, his prints would be on it, but they were wiped. Therefore, the testimony that he tossed the pistol and fled contradicts the evidence that the pistol had no prints. So the killer (defendant) couldn't have handled the pistol without leaving prints unless they wiped them, but according to the testimony, he just tossed it and fled. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 4 and Evidence 14.

But wait, maybe someone else wiped the prints. But the testimony claims that the defendant (Wocky) tossed the pistol and fled. So if he did that, his prints would be on the pistol. But the evidence says the prints were wiped. Therefore, the testimony and evidence contradict each other because the pistol should have prints if he handled it, but it doesn't. So the contradiction is Testimony 4 (tossing the pistol) and Evidence 14 (prints wiped). That's the pair.

{"evidence": 14, "testimony": 4}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find which piece of evidence contradicts one of the testimonies given. The characters, evidences, and testimonies are all listed, and I need to find a pair where the evidence directly contradicts a testimony.

First, I should go through each testimony and see what they claim, then check the evidence to find inconsistencies.

Looking at the testimonies from Wesley Stickler (Testimony 0 to 5). Let's check each one.

Testimony 4 says: "Why, I even remember the sign on the stand the victim was pulling! It said 'NOODLE'!" The person is Stickler.

Now, looking at the evidence related to the noodle stand. Evidence 12 is the Noodle Stand with a sign that reads "ELDOON". Wait, the testimony claims the sign said "NOODLE", but the actual evidence shows the sign says "ELDOON". That's a direct contradiction. So the testimony is wrong about the sign's text. Therefore, Evidence 12 contradicts Testimony 4.

Let me double-check. Evidence 12's name is Noodle Stand, description mentions the sign reads "ELDOON". Testimony 4 says the sign said "NOODLE". Since the actual sign is "ELDOON", this testimony is incorrect, hence the contradiction. That seems solid. Are there any other contradictions?

Another possible angle: Testimony 5 says Stickler saw the defendant at the scene. But maybe some evidence shows the defendant wasn't there? But the defendant is Wocky Kitaki. The evidence includes the knife (Evidence 10) with his prints, but that could be planted. However, that's not a direct contradiction to the testimony. The most straightforward contradiction is between Testimony 4 and Evidence 12.

{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 4}

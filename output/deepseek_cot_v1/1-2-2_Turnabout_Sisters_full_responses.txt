Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants just one pair. Let's look through the provided information.

First, the characters. Mia Fey is the victim, Maya is the sister found at the scene. Gumshoe is the detective who did the investigation. April May testifies she saw Maya commit the murder. Redd White is another witness, CEO of Bluecorp. Then there's a bunch of evidence and testimonies.

The testimonies from Gumshoe (Testimonies 0 to 5) are about finding a memo with "Maya" written in blood, which he claims the victim wrote before dying. The key points here are that the memo (Maya's name) was written in the victim's blood, found on the victim's finger, implying she wrote it with her own blood as a dying message.

Now looking at the evidences. Evidence 3 is a Receipt that's a department store receipt with letters written in blood on the back. The receipt is for a glass light stand, purchased the day before the murder. Evidence 2 is Glass Shards, which are the broken remains of a glass light stand, broken beyond recognition. 

Wait, if the receipt (Evidence 3) has blood writing on the back, but the memo that Gumshoe refers to (Testimony 1-2) is the one with "Maya" written in blood. But Evidence 3's receipt's back has blood writing. So maybe there's a contradiction here. Because the testimony says the memo (which is a piece of paper next to the body) has the name in blood, but the receipt with blood writing is separate. However, maybe the actual memo that's being referred to in the testimonies is different from the receipt. Wait, Evidence 4 is Maya's Memo, which mentions a conversation recorded on her cell phone. Then Evidence 6 is the cell phone with the conversation. 

Wait, the testimonies from Gumshoe (Testimony 1 and 2) say that he found a memo next to the victim's body with "Maya" written in blood. But Evidence 3 is a receipt that has blood writing on the back. So perhaps the memo that Gumshoe found (Testimony 1) is the receipt (Evidence 3), but the receipt's description says it's a receipt for a glass light stand purchased the day before the murder. But if the receipt was purchased the day before, how could the victim have written on it with her blood at the time of death, which was the day after the receipt was purchased? Wait, the murder happened on 9/5 at 9:00PM (from Autopsy Report, Evidence 5). The receipt's date is the day before the murder, so 9/4. So the receipt was purchased on 9/4. But the blood writing on it would have to be done on 9/5 when the murder happened. But how could the receipt, purchased a day earlier, have the victim's blood on it if the victim was killed the next day? Unless the receipt was at the scene and the victim used it to write the message. But then, the testimony says that the memo was written on a piece of paper next to the body. If that piece of paper is the receipt, then the receipt was present at the scene. But the receipt was from the day before, which is possible. However, the problem arises when considering the blood on the receipt. If the receipt was purchased the day before, but the blood on it is the victim's (from the day of the murder), then that's possible. The contradiction might not be there. Let me check again.

Wait, the testimony says the memo was written next to the body, with "Maya" in blood, and the lab tests confirmed it's the victim's blood. The receipt (Evidence 3) is a different item, right? Because Evidence 3's receipt is a separate piece of evidence. But wait, Testimony 1 says "a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body" which would be Evidence 4: Maya's Memo, but Evidence 4's description says it's a note about a conversation recorded on her cell phone. That's different. So perhaps the memo that Gumshoe refers to in his testimony (the one with "Maya" in blood) is not listed as a separate evidence. Wait, but looking at the list of evidences, the only blood-related written evidence is Evidence 3 (Receipt with blood writing) and maybe the Autopsy Report. Wait, the memo with "Maya" in blood would be the one the testimony is talking about. But according to the given evidences, Evidence 3 is a receipt with blood on the back. So if the testimony claims that the victim wrote "Maya" in her own blood on a memo (the piece of paper next to the body), but the actual evidence (Evidence 3) is a receipt with blood writing, which was purchased the day before, then that's a contradiction. Because the receipt was already there the day before, so the victim couldn't have written on it with her blood during the murder. Unless the receipt was at the scene and the victim used it to write the message. But the receipt's purchase date is the day before the murder. The murder is on 9/5. The receipt is from 9/4. So the receipt was already in existence before the murder. Therefore, if the victim wrote on it with her blood on 9/5, that's possible. But the problem would be if the receipt wasn't present at the scene until the murder. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the memo that the testimony refers to is not the receipt. But according to the given evidences, the only blood-written evidence is the receipt. Unless there's another one. Wait, the Autopsy Report (Evidence 5) says that the victim died from a blunt object, and the time of death is 9/5 9PM. The testimony says that the victim wrote the killer's name before dying, which would be at the time of death. But if the receipt was purchased the day before, and the victim wrote on it with her blood on the day of the murder, then that's possible. So maybe no contradiction here. 

Wait, maybe another angle. The testimony says that the victim wrote the killer's name in her own blood on the memo (Testimony 5). But the Autopsy Report (Evidence 5) says that death was instantaneous, but also that she "may have lived for a few minutes after being hit." So there's a contradiction here. If the death was instantaneous, she couldn't have written anything. But the report says "may have lived for a few minutes," so maybe she could have. That's not a contradiction between evidence and testimony. 

Looking for other contradictions. Let's check Testimony 2: "On it, the word 'Maya' was written clearly in blood." And Testimony 3: Lab tests showed the blood was the victim's. So the memo (the paper) has Maya's name in the victim's blood. Now, Evidence 3 is the receipt with blood writing. If the receipt is the memo, then the receipt's date being the day before is okay if the receipt was at the scene. But the receipt's purchase date is the day before, which is possible. The problem could be that the receipt is for a glass light stand, which was broken (Evidence 2: Glass Shards). So if the receipt is for the glass light stand, which was broken, but the receipt itself is present at the scene. Maybe the receipt was in the office, and the victim used it to write the message. So that's possible. 

Wait, but if the receipt was purchased the day before, then the killer could have brought it. Hmm. Maybe another angle. The testimony says that the victim wrote the name, but if the receipt was from the day before, then the blood on the receipt would have to be from the day of the murder. So the victim's blood is on the receipt, which was already purchased the day before. That's possible. So maybe not a contradiction. 

Let's look at other evidences. Evidence 2 is Glass Shards from a broken light stand. Evidence 3 is the receipt for the light stand, purchased the day before. So the glass light stand was purchased the day before, broken into shards (Evidence 2). The receipt has blood writing. Maybe the killer bought the light stand, used it somehow. But how does that contradict the testimony?

Alternatively, looking at the Autopsy Report (Evidence 5) says the cause was a single blunt force trauma, death instantaneous. But Testimony 9 (from April May?) says the victim dodged an attack, ran, then was struck. If the death was instantaneous, maybe that contradicts Testimony 9. But Testimony 9 is not listed here. Wait, in the Testimonies provided (0-5 are from Gumshoe). The Testimony 9 mentioned in the Evidences is part of the Evidence 9: May Testimony. Wait, the user provided Testimonies as a separate list. The Testimonies listed are from 0 to 5, all from Gumshoe. So the May Testimony (Evidence 9) is an evidence, not a testimony in the Testimonies list. So the user is supposed to check the Testimonies (0-5 from Gumshoe) against the Evidences (0-14). 

Wait, so the problem is to find a pair where a testimony (from the Testimonies list) contradicts an evidence (from the Evidences list). So for example, if a testimony says something that is contradicted by an evidence.

Looking again. Testimony 5: Gumshoe says "Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!" This is supported by the memo with "Maya" in blood. But the Autopsy Report (Evidence 5) says "Death was instantaneous. May have lived for a few minutes after being hit." So if the death was instantaneous, she couldn't have written the name. But the report also says "May have lived for a few minutes," which is conflicting. However, this might not be a direct contradiction. Because "instantaneous" and "a few minutes" are conflicting. So the autopsy report itself is contradictory. But the testimony says she wrote before dying. If the report says death was instantaneous, then she couldn't have written. But the report also says "may have lived for a few minutes," so maybe it's possible. So that might not be a solid contradiction.

Another angle: Testimony 1 says Gumshoe found a memo written on a piece of paper next to the victim's body. Evidence 3 is a receipt with blood writing. If the memo in Testimony 1 is the receipt (Evidence 3), then the receipt being purchased the day before could mean that the receipt was already present. But how is that a contradiction? Unless the receipt was in the possession of someone else. Alternatively, maybe the memo mentioned in Testimony 1 is different from Evidence 3. But the evidence list doesn't have a separate memo with "Maya" written in blood. The only memos are Maya's Memo (Evidence 4) which is about a conversation on her cell phone, and Mia's Memo (Evidence 14), a list of names. So the memo with "Maya" in blood is not listed as an evidence. Wait, that's a problem. Because according to the testimonies, Gumshoe found a memo with "Maya" written in blood, but in the evidences, the only blood-written item is the receipt (Evidence 3). So perhaps the memo that Gumshoe refers to is the receipt. But if the receipt's date is the day before, then the victim couldn't have written on it during the murder unless she had the receipt with her. But the receipt is for a glass light stand, which was broken (Evidence 2). The receipt's purchase date is the day before, which is plausible. So maybe the receipt was at the scene, and the victim used it to write the message. But how is that a contradiction?

Wait, perhaps the receipt (Evidence 3) is for the glass light stand (Evidence 2), which was purchased the day before the murder. The glass shards are from the light stand. The receipt's date being the day before indicates that the purchase happened before the murder. But the testimony claims that the victim wrote the killer's name in her own blood on the receipt. But if the receipt was purchased the day before, then the receipt was already in existence. That's possible. So maybe no contradiction here.

Wait, another thought: The receipt (Evidence 3) has blood writing on the back, which is supposed to be the victim's. But the receipt was purchased the day before, so it was in someone's possession before the murder. If the victim wrote on it during the murder, that's possible. But if the receipt wasn't present at the scene until after the murder, then how did the victim get it? Alternatively, if the receipt was already at the scene (the law office), then the victim could have written on it. No contradiction here.

Hmm. Let me check another angle. The testimonies say that the victim wrote "Maya" in her own blood on the memo. But the actual evidence (the receipt) is a different item. If the memo in Testimony 1 is supposed to be a separate piece of evidence not listed, but in the given evidences, the only one with blood is the receipt, then that's a discrepancy. But according to the provided data, the user might be expected to find that the memo with "Maya" in blood (as per testimony) is actually the receipt (Evidence 3), but the receipt's purchase date being the day before implies that the victim couldn't have written on it unless she had it. But that's possible. So maybe not a contradiction.

Alternatively, Testimony 4 says there was blood found on the victim's finger. If the victim used her own blood to write, then her finger would have blood. That's consistent. No contradiction.

Wait, what about Evidence 1: The Thinker, which is the murder weapon. It's a clock statue with gears removed. If the cause of death is blunt force trauma (Evidence 5), then the statue could be the weapon. That's consistent. No contradiction.

Another possible contradiction: The Autopsy Report (Evidence 5) says the victim died at 9:00 PM. But maybe a testimony or evidence suggests a different time. Let's check the testimonies. The testimonies from Gumshoe don't mention the time. The other testimonies are from other characters, but in the provided Testimonies list, only Gumshoe's are present. So no contradiction there.

Wait, Evidence 7 is a wiretap found in April May's hotel room. Testimony from April May (not in the Testimonies list here) says she saw Maya commit the murder. If the wiretap was in her room, maybe she was being spied on, but that's a different angle. But since the user is focusing on Testimonies 0-5 (Gumshoe) and Evidences 0-14, perhaps another angle.

Wait, Testimony 2 says the word "Maya" was written in blood on the memo. Evidence 3 is a receipt with blood on the back. If the receipt has blood writing, but the receipt's purchase date is the day before the murder, then the blood on the receipt must have been from the day of the murder. But the receipt was already present. So if the receipt was at the scene, the victim could have written on it. So no problem.

Wait, unless the receipt's blood writing isn't "Maya". The receipt's description says "letters written in blood", but Testimony 2 specifies the word "Maya" was written. If the receipt's blood letters are not "Maya", then that's a contradiction. But according to the given data, the receipt's blood writing is just "letters", not specified as "Maya". But the memo in the testimonies says "Maya" is written. So if the receipt is supposed to be that memo, but the receipt's blood writing isn't "Maya", that's a contradiction. But how do we know? The user has to assume that the memo in Testimony 1-2 is the receipt (Evidence 3), but the receipt's description doesn't mention the content of the blood writing, just that it has letters. So if the testimony says it's "Maya", but the evidence's receipt's writing is something else, that's a contradiction. But according to the given data, the user doesn't have the content of the receipt's blood letters. Hmm. This is a bit tricky.

Alternatively, the contradiction could be between Testimony 3 and Evidence 3. Testimony 3 says the blood on the memo was the victim's. Evidence 3's receipt has blood on it, but if that blood isn't the victim's, then there's a contradiction. But Testimony 3 says the lab tests showed the blood was the victim's. So if the receipt's blood is the victim's, then no contradiction. But if the receipt's blood is someone else's, then contradiction. But we don't have that information. The user's data says Evidence 3's receipt has blood writing, but no info on whose blood. Testimony 3 says the blood on the memo (which is the receipt in this case) is the victim's. So if the receipt's blood is the victim's, no contradiction. If it's not, then contradiction. But the user isn't told whose blood is on the receipt, only that the lab tests (per Testimony 3) say it's the victim's. So unless there's another evidence contradicting that. Hmm. 

Wait, Evidence 4 is Maya's Memo, which is about a recorded conversation. That's separate. So perhaps the memo referred to in the testimonies is not listed as evidence, but that's not possible. The user must find a contradiction between an evidence and a testimony from the given lists.

Wait, another angle: The receipt (Evidence 3) is a department store receipt. If the receipt was for a glass light stand purchased the day before the murder, then the glass light stand (Evidence 2) was present at the scene. But the murder weapon is the Thinker statue (Evidence 1). So the glass shards are from a light stand, which was purchased the day before. But the murder was committed with the statue. So no contradiction there. 

Alternatively, Testimony 9 (which is Evidence 9) from April May says the victim dodged an attack and ran right before being struck. But the Autopsy Report (Evidence 5) says death was instantaneous. If the victim dodged and ran, she must have been alive for a bit, which matches the "may have lived a few minutes" part. So no contradiction here.

Wait, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 2 and Evidence 3. Testimony 2 says the memo has "Maya" written in blood, but Evidence 3 is a receipt with blood letters, which might not say "Maya". But how do we know? The problem is that the receipt's description doesn't specify what's written, but the testimony does. If the receipt is the memo in question, and the receipt's blood writing isn't "Maya", that's a contradiction. However, according to the given data, the receipt's blood writing isn't specified. Therefore, this might not be a valid contradiction. 

Alternatively, the memo that Gumshoe refers to in his testimonies (Testimony 1-2) is supposed to be Evidence 4 (Maya's Memo), but Evidence 4's description is about a recorded conversation, not blood. That would be a contradiction. For example, if the testimony says the memo was written in blood with "Maya", but the actual evidence (Maya's Memo) is a different memo about a cell phone recording. That would mean the memo found is not the one described in the testimony. But according to the given data, the testimonies are from Gumshoe about finding a memo with "Maya" in blood. If the evidence list doesn't include such a memo but instead includes the receipt with blood, then the contradiction is that the testimony refers to a memo that's not present in evidence, but perhaps the receipt is supposed to be that memo. However, if the receipt's blood writing is not "Maya", then there's a contradiction. But the data doesn't specify. 

Wait, the user has to choose from the given evidence and testimony pairs. Let's look for clearer contradictions. 

Testimony 5 from Gumshoe: "Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!" But the Autopsy Report (Evidence 5) states that the victim "may have lived for a few minutes after being hit." So if the victim was hit and then lived for a few minutes, she could have written the name. But the initial statement says "Death was instantaneous. May have lived for a few minutes..." which is conflicting. However, the testimony is about the victim writing before dying, which would align with the possibility that she survived a few minutes. So no contradiction.

Another angle: The Thinker (Evidence 1) is the murder weapon, a clock statue with gears removed. The cause of death is blunt force trauma. That's consistent. 

Testimony 9 (Evidence 9) is April May's testimony that the victim dodged and was struck. But this is not part of the Testimonies list (which are 0-5 from Gumshoe). So we can't pair that with evidences here.

Wait, what about Evidence 2 (Glass Shards) and Testimony 1 (Gumshoe found a memo next to the body)? The Glass Shards are from a light stand purchased the day before (Evidence 3). The receipt (Evidence 3) is for that purchase, and it's possible the glass shards are from the broken light stand. But how does this contradict any testimony? 

Wait, Testimony 1 says Gumshoe found a memo next to the body. If the memo is the receipt (Evidence 3), which was purchased the day before, but the receipt is from a department store, then maybe the receipt shouldn't be at the law office. Unless the victim bought it and brought it there. But that's possible. 

Alternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 2 ("Maya" written in blood) and Evidence 3's receipt's purchase date. For example, if the receipt was purchased the day before, how did the victim write on it with her blood the next day? But that's possible if the receipt was at the scene. So no contradiction.

Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 5, which claims the victim wrote the killer's name, and Evidence 3, which is a receipt with blood writing. If the victim's name written is Maya, but the receipt's blood writing is something else, then contradiction. But since the receipt's description doesn't specify what's written, maybe the user is supposed to assume that the receipt's blood writing is not "Maya". Alternatively, the receipt is for the glass stand, and the killer's name is different. But without knowing the content of the receipt's blood writing, this is speculative.

Wait, looking back at the problem, perhaps the key contradiction is between Testimony 2 ("Maya" written in blood on the memo) and Evidence 3 (Receipt with blood letters). The problem is that the receipt is dated the day before the murder, so the victim couldn't have written her name on it during the murder. But if the receipt was present at the scene and the victim used it to write the message during her death, that's possible. Unless the receipt wasn't at the scene until after the murder.

Alternatively, the memo that Gumshoe refers to (Testimony 1) is the same as Evidence 4 (Maya's Memo), which is about a cell phone conversation. But Testimony 2 says the memo has "Maya" in blood. But Evidence 4's description doesn't mention blood. That's a contradiction. So if the memo found at the scene (Evidence 4) is about a conversation, but the testimony says it has "Maya" in blood, that's a contradiction. For example, the testimony claims the memo has "Maya" written in blood, but the actual evidence (Maya's Memo) is a different memo. So this would be a contradiction between Testimony 2 and Evidence 4. But according to the data:

Testimony 1: found a memo next to the body. Testimony 2: the word Maya in blood. Testimony 3: blood is victim's.

Evidence 4: Maya's Memo: conversation recorded on cell phone.

So if the memo in Evidence 4 is the same one Testimony 1 refers to, but it's about a phone conversation and not blood, then that's a contradiction. But the testimony says it's written in blood. Thus, the memo described in the testimony is not the same as Evidence 4, implying that the memo with "Maya" in blood is missing from the evidence list, but the receipt (Evidence 3) is the actual memo. However, since the receipt's description says it has blood writing, perhaps that's the memo. But if the receipt's purchase date is the day before, then the victim could have written on it during the murder. So maybe no contradiction. 

Wait, but the memo in the testimonies is supposed to be a piece of paper next to the body with "Maya" in blood. If the evidence list includes a receipt (Evidence 3) with blood writing, but the receipt's purpose is unrelated (it's a receipt for a glass stand), then the real memo with "Maya" in blood is not present as evidence. This could imply that the testimony is lying or mistaken, but the user needs to find a contradiction between existing evidence and testimony. 

Alternatively, the memo in the testimony is the receipt (Evidence 3). So the receipt has "Maya" written in blood. But the receipt was purchased the day before the murder, so the victim couldn't have written on it unless she had it during the murder. Which is possible. But the receipt's date isn't a contradiction here. 

Hmm. I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of the most straightforward contradiction. The Autopsy Report (Evidence 5) says the victim died from a blow by a blunt object, which matches The Thinker (Evidence 1) as the weapon. No contradiction. 

Testimony 5 says the victim wrote the killer's name. The receipt (Evidence 3) has blood writing. If the receipt's blood writing is the killer's name, and the testimony says it's Maya, but the receipt's writing is not Maya, then contradiction. But we don't know the content of the receipt's writing. 

Wait, but the receipt's description says "letters written in blood", but Testimony 2 says the word "Maya" is written. If the receipt is the memo, then the receipt should have "Maya" written, but the receipt's description doesn't say that. So maybe this is a contradiction. However, the problem is that the evidence description for the receipt doesn't specify the content. But in the game, usually, such a contradiction would be that the receipt has something else written, like the actual killer's name. For example, if the receipt's blood writing is "Redd" or something else, contradicting the testimony's claim of "Maya". But given the data provided, we can't be sure. 

Alternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (blood on the memo is victim's) and Evidence 3's receipt. But if the receipt's blood is the victim's, no contradiction. So not helpful.

Wait, another angle: The receipt (Evidence 3) is for a glass light stand purchased the day before. The glass shards (Evidence 2) are from that stand. The Thinker (Evidence 1) is the murder weapon. So the glass stand being broken is a separate event. No contradiction here.

Wait, let me think again. The testimonies from Gumshoe (0-5) all relate to finding a memo with "Maya" in blood, written by the victim. The key point is that the victim wrote this as a dying message. However, the receipt (Evidence 3) is a department store receipt with blood writing. If the receipt is the memo in question, then the date on the receipt is the day before the murder, which means the receipt existed before the murder. The victim could have written on it during the murder. But the problem is that the receipt's purchase date is the day before, but the blood on it is from the victim, who was killed the next day. That's possible. So no contradiction.

Wait, unless the receipt's purchase date is the same as the murder date. But it's the day before. So no. 

Maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (victim wrote the killer's name) and Evidence 4 (Maya's Memo). Evidence 4's memo says that a conversation with her sister is recorded on her cell phone. If the victim wrote "Maya" as the killer, but there's a memo suggesting a recorded conversation that could exonerate Maya, that's a contradiction. But this is more of a plot point than a direct evidence-testimony contradiction.

Alternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 2 (Maya's name in blood) and Evidence 4 (Maya's memo about a phone conversation). If the memo in the testimony is Evidence 4, but Evidence 4 doesn't have blood, then contradiction. For example, Testimony 2 says the memo has blood, but Evidence 4's memo is about a phone call. So if the memo is the same, then the testimony is lying. So the pair would be Evidence 4 and Testimony 2. 

But according to the data:

Testimony 1: found a memo next to the body. Testimony 2: "Maya" in blood on it. 

Evidence 4: Maya's Memo: conversation recorded on cell phone.

So if the memo found (Testimony 1) is Evidence 4, then the testimony's description of it having "Maya" in blood contradicts the evidence's description of it being about a phone call. Therefore, the testimony's claim about the memo's content (blood-written "Maya") is contradicted by the evidence's actual content (phone conversation note). That would be a valid contradiction. 

So the contradiction is between Testimony 2 (which claims the memo has "Maya" in blood) and Evidence 4 (which is Maya's Memo about a phone call). Therefore, the testimony is referring to a different memo than Evidence 4, but if the only memo evidence is 4, then the testimony's memo is not present, implying a contradiction. But the user is supposed to pick one pair from the given lists. 

Thus, the correct pair is Evidence 4 (Maya's Memo) and Testimony 2 (which says the memo has "Maya" in blood), because the evidence's memo is about a phone call, not blood.

{"evidence": 4, "testimony": 2}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the problem is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants one pair. Let's start by looking through the testimonies and see which ones might conflict with the evidence provided.

First, the testimonies are from April May. She's testifying that she saw Maya kill Mia. Let's go through each testimony one by one.

Testimony 0: "I did see everything! I did!" – That's just a general statement claiming she witnessed the murder. Not sure yet what contradicts this.

Testimony 1: "The victim dodged the first attack and ran off to the right." So, Mia dodged an attack and ran to the right. Testimony 2 continues: "Then the girl in the hippie clothes ran after her..." Then Testimony 3: "And she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did!" So, according to April, Maya chased Mia and hit her with the weapon, The Thinker statue.

Now, looking at the evidence. Let's check the autopsy report, Evidence 5: Mia's Autopsy Report. It says the cause of death was a single blunt force trauma, death was instantaneous. But wait, it also says "May have lived for a few minutes after being hit." Hmm, that's a bit conflicting. Wait, the cause is a single blow, death was instantaneous, but then it says may have lived a few minutes. That seems contradictory, but maybe it's a typo. Wait, maybe the testimony says that Mia ran after being hit once, but the autopsy says death was instantaneous. Let me check.

Wait, the testimony says Mia dodged an attack, ran to the right, then Maya chased and hit her. But if the autopsy says death was instantaneous from a single blow, then how could Mia run after the attack? Wait, but the testimony says she dodged the first attack (so the first attack missed), then ran, and then was hit. So the actual fatal blow was the second one. But the autopsy says a single blow caused death. So that might be a contradiction. Wait, the autopsy says "single blunt force trauma" and "Death was instantaneous". So the fatal blow was one hit. But April's testimony says that Mia was hit after dodging the first attack. Wait, no—April says that the victim (Mia) dodged an attack (maybe the first swing from Maya), then ran to the right, then Maya caught up and hit her. So the actual killing blow would be that second hit. But according to the autopsy, the death was caused by a single blow. So if the autopsy says there was only one blow that caused death, but the testimony implies two attacks (the first dodged, the second fatal), that could be a contradiction. Wait, but maybe the autopsy is referring to the single fatal blow. The testimony might not be contradicting that. Wait, maybe not. Let's look for other contradictions.

Another angle: The Thinker statue (Evidence 1) is the murder weapon. The clock's gears have been removed. But the testimony from April (Testimony 4) refers to The Thinker as the weapon. So that's consistent. 

What about the time of death? Autopsy says 9:00 PM. Let's see if any other evidence contradicts that. Maybe the receipt (Evidence 3) is for a glass light stand purchased the day before. The glass shards (Evidence 2) are from a broken light stand. If the receipt is from the day before, maybe the light stand was broken during the murder. But how does that relate to the testimonies?

Looking at the wiretap (Evidence 7) found in April's hotel room. Maybe that indicates she was spying, so her testimony is unreliable. But that's more about credibility than direct contradiction.

Maya's Memo (Evidence 4) mentions a conversation recorded on her cell phone (Evidence 6). If that conversation shows something different than April's testimony, that could contradict. For example, if the phone call was at a time when Maya was elsewhere, but I don't have details of the conversation.

Wait, Testimony 1 says Mia dodged the first attack and ran to the right. Then in Testimony 3, April says she saw Maya hit her with the weapon. But the floor plans (Evidence 8) might show the layout. If the right direction leads to a place where there's no room to run, but the floor plan isn't detailed here. Without details, maybe that's not the contradiction.

Alternatively, the autopsy report (Evidence 5) says Mia may have lived for a few minutes after being hit. But the testimony says she was struck and died instantly? Wait, the autopsy says death was instantaneous, but also may have lived a few minutes. Wait, that's confusing. Let me read Evidence 5 again: "Cause: single blunt force trauma. Death was instantaneous. Died from a blow by a blunt object. May have lived for a few minutes after being hit." Wait, that's a contradiction in the autopsy itself. But maybe it's a typo. Wait, perhaps the initial assessment was that death was instantaneous, but upon further examination, she might have lived a few minutes. That could mean that the testimony's account of events (Mia running after being hit) is impossible if the death was instantaneous, but the autopsy says she may have lived a few minutes. Hmm, but if the autopsy says death was instantaneous, then Mia couldn't have run after being hit. But in the testimony, Mia was hit after dodging an initial attack. Wait, the initial attack was dodged, so the first hit missed. Then Mia ran, then was hit by the second attack. If that second attack was the fatal blow, then the autopsy's "instantaneous death" would mean she couldn't have moved after that. But according to the testimony, she was hit once (the second attack) and died. So that's consistent with the autopsy. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, maybe the Thinker statue's gears were removed (Evidence 1), making it lighter or different. Does that affect anything? Not sure. 

Another angle: The receipt (Evidence 3) is for a glass light stand purchased the day before. The glass shards (Evidence 2) are from a broken light stand. If the receipt is dated the day before, maybe the light stand was broken during the murder. But how does that relate to the testimony? Unless the light stand was the actual weapon, but the testimony says the Thinker was used. So if the glass shards are from a light stand broken during the murder, but the murder weapon is the Thinker, that's not a contradiction. Unless the broken glass is part of the crime scene, but that's not directly conflicting.

Wait, April's testimony (Testimony 1) says that Mia dodged the first attack and ran to the right. But the floor plan (Evidence 8) might show that there's no right to run to, but without details, we can't use that. 

Wait, the Mia's Autopsy Report (Evidence 5) says the cause was a single blunt force trauma, death was instantaneous. Then, if the testimony claims that after being hit, Mia was struck and died, but the autopsy says instantaneous, which would mean she couldn't have run after being hit. But in the testimony, the attack sequence is: first, an attack that Mia dodges (so that didn't hit her), then she runs, then Maya catches up and hits her with the Thinker. So the fatal blow is that second hit, which according to the autopsy caused instantaneous death. That seems consistent. So maybe there's another contradiction.

Looking at Testimony 3: "And she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did!" The weapon is The Thinker (Evidence 1). The Thinker is described as a clock statue with gears removed. If the gears were removed, maybe it's lighter, but that's not directly contradicting the testimony. Unless the gears being removed means it couldn't have caused the injury described. But the autopsy says blunt force trauma, so a heavy statue would do that even without gears. So no contradiction there.

What about Testimony 4, where April identifies the weapon as The Thinker. That's consistent with Evidence 1. So no issue there.

Looking at the wiretap (Evidence 7) in April's hotel room. If April was being monitored, maybe her testimony is fabricated. But that's a credibility issue, not a direct contradiction between evidence and testimony.

The receipt (Evidence 3) has letters in blood on the back. Maybe those letters indicate something, but without knowing what they are, it's hard to say.

Maya's cell phone (Evidence 6) has a conversation between Mia and Maya. If that conversation happened at a time when April claims the murder occurred, that could contradict. For example, if the phone call was at 9 PM (time of death), Maya couldn't be both on the phone and committing the murder. But the user hasn't provided the details of the conversation, so we can't assume that. So without that info, maybe this isn't the contradiction.

Wait, the problem says "Maya's Memo" (Evidence 4) says the conversation is recorded on her cell phone. If that conversation's timestamp is around the time of the murder (9 PM), and April's testimony says Maya was attacking Mia at that time, then that's a contradiction. But the user hasn't given the timestamp. So maybe that's not usable.

Alternatively, let's check the time of death. Autopsy says 9:00 PM. Suppose the conversation on Maya's cell phone was at 9 PM, then she couldn't be the murderer. But again, without the details, we can't confirm. So maybe not.

Wait, another angle: The Thinker statue's gears were removed (Evidence 1). If the gears were removed, maybe the statue wasn't functional as a clock. But the testimony refers to it as a clock. But the testimony calls it a "statue-y clock", so that's consistent with Evidence 1, which says it's a clock in the form of a statue.

Hmm. Let's go back to the autopsy. The cause is a single blow, death instantaneous. The testimony says that Mia was hit after dodging an initial attack. So the fatal blow is the second one, which the autopsy confirms as the single blow. That seems consistent. So maybe that's not the contradiction.

Wait, the autopsy also says "May have lived for a few minutes after being hit." That part contradicts "death was instantaneous." But that's within the same evidence. Maybe that's a typo or mistake in the evidence, but the user might consider that. But the problem is looking for a contradiction between evidence and testimony.

Another possibility: The receipt (Evidence 3) is for a glass light stand purchased the day before the murder. The glass shards (Evidence 2) are from a broken light stand. Suppose the murder weapon was actually the light stand, not The Thinker. Then April's testimony about The Thinker being the weapon would contradict the evidence. But according to Evidence 1, The Thinker is the murder weapon, so that's not the case. The glass shards are just from another object broken during the incident. Maybe during a struggle, the light stand was broken. So that doesn't contradict the testimony.

Wait, the receipt is dated the day before the murder. So the light stand was purchased then. The murder was on 9/5 (from autopsy), so the receipt is from 9/4. The glass shards are from that light stand. If the light stand was broken during the murder, but the testimony doesn't mention it, maybe that's a discrepancy. But the testimony is about the murder weapon, not the light stand.

Alternatively, if the light stand was broken during the attack, but April's testimony doesn't mention it, that's an omission, not a contradiction. The question is about direct contradictions between a specific evidence and testimony.

Let me think again. April's testimony (Testimony 1 and 3) claims that after dodging, Mia was hit once and died. The autopsy says death was instantaneous from a single blow. That matches. But the autopsy also mentions that Mia may have lived a few minutes. So if the testimony says she died instantly, but the evidence says she could have lived a few minutes, that's a contradiction. Wait, no. The testimony doesn't say she died instantly; it just says she was hit. The autopsy says death was instantaneous, which would mean she died immediately upon being hit. But the autopsy also says "may have lived for a few minutes after being hit." That's conflicting within the same evidence. But perhaps the user intended that the testimony says Mia was hit and died, but the autopsy allows for her surviving a few minutes. Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me re-express:

Autopsy Report (Evidence 5):
- Time of death: 9/5 at 9:00 PM
- Cause: single blunt force trauma. Death was instantaneous.
- "Died from a blow by a blunt object. May have lived for a few minutes after being hit."

Wait, that's contradictory. The first part says death was instantaneous, the last part says may have lived a few minutes. That's a problem in the autopsy report itself. But how does that relate to the testimony?

If the testimony says that after being hit, the victim died immediately (as per Testimony 3: "hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did!"), and the autopsy's "may have lived a few minutes" suggests she didn't die instantly, that's a contradiction. But the autopsy also says "death was instantaneous." So maybe the key contradiction is between Testimony 1 and the autopsy. Testimony 1 says Mia dodged the first attack, ran to the right, then was caught and hit. If the fatal blow was the one that killed her instantly, then she couldn't have run after being hit. But in the testimony, she was hit after running. So the sequence is: dodge first attack (miss), run, then get hit. So the fatal blow is the second attack. The autopsy says the cause is a single blow, so that's consistent. The confusion is in the autopsy's own note about possibly living a few minutes. Maybe that's a red herring.

Alternatively, perhaps the contradiction is in the fact that the Thinker statue had its gears removed, making it lighter, so the force required for a fatal blow might be less, but that's speculative.

Wait, another angle: The wiretap (Evidence 7) found in April's hotel room. If April was being tapped, maybe her testimony is fabricated because she was being monitored or coerced. But that's more about her credibility, not a direct contradiction between evidence and testimony.

Looking back, maybe the key contradiction is between the autopsy's time of death and the phone call. For example, if Maya's cell phone (Evidence 6) has a conversation that took place at 9 PM, then she couldn't be the murderer. But without knowing the time of the call, we can't confirm. The user hasn't provided the details of the phone conversation, so we can't use that.

Wait, the Mia's Autopsy Report says time of death is 9:00 PM. If the conversation on Maya's phone (Evidence 6) occurred at that time, then Maya couldn't be attacking Mia. But since the memo (Evidence 4) says the conversation is recorded, maybe the time of the call contradicts the time of the murder. However, without explicit information on the call's timing, we can't use this. So perhaps this isn't the pair.

Wait, let's consider Testimony 1: "The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right." The floor plans (Evidence 8) might show that there's no right to run to. For example, if the office layout as per the floor plans indicates that to the right is a dead end or a wall, then Mia couldn't have run there. But since the user hasn't provided the floor plan details, we can't verify that. So maybe this isn't the contradiction.

Another possibility: The receipt (Evidence 3) is for a glass light stand purchased the day before. The glass shards (Evidence 2) are from that stand. If the light stand was broken during the murder, but April's testimony doesn't mention it, but that's not a contradiction. The testimony focuses on the murder weapon, not other broken objects.

Wait, maybe the receipt's date is the day before the murder. If the light stand was broken during the murder, which was on 9/5, then the purchase date being 9/4 makes sense. No contradiction there.

Hmm. I'm struggling to find the contradiction. Let's try to think differently. The key is to find a testimony statement that directly contradicts a piece of evidence.

Looking at Testimony 3: "And she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did!" The weapon is The Thinker (Evidence 1). The Thinker is described as a clock statue with gears removed. If the gears were removed, maybe the statue's weight or structure is different. But the testimony just refers to it as the weapon, which matches the evidence.

Another angle: The Thinker statue's gears removed (Evidence 1). If the gears were part of the clock mechanism, removing them might make the statue lighter. But the autopsy report says the cause was blunt force trauma, which a statue could still cause. So no contradiction.

Wait, the Autopsy Report (Evidence 5) says "Death was instantaneous. Died from a blow by a blunt object. May have lived for a few minutes after being hit." The last part contradicts itself. If death was instantaneous, she couldn't have lived for a few minutes. But this is within the same evidence. However, how does this relate to testimony?

If the testimony says that after being hit, the victim died immediately (which is what the first part of the autopsy says), but the evidence says she may have lived a few minutes, that's a contradiction. But the testimony doesn't explicitly state the timing of death after the blow. It just says she was hit. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, the testimony says Mia dodged an attack (Testimony 1), then ran to the right, then was hit (Testimony 3). If the autopsy says death was instantaneous, then after being hit, Mia couldn't have moved. But in the testimony, the hit is what killed her, so she wouldn't have moved after that. So no contradiction.

Wait, maybe the direction she ran. The Floor Plans (Evidence 8) might show that running to the right leads to a place that's not possible, but without details, we can't tell.

Wait, looking back, Testimony 9: "The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck." That's May Testimony (Evidence 9). Wait, Evidence 9 is May Testimony, which is the same as Testimony 1-4. Wait, no. Wait, in the list of evidences, Evidence 9 is named "May Testimony" with the description: "The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck." That's redundant with Testimony 1 and 3. So maybe the testimony in the Testimony list is the same as Evidence 9. But how does that help?

Alternatively, perhaps the contradiction is between the receipt (Evidence 3) which is for a glass light stand purchased the day before, and the glass shards (Evidence 2) which are from a light stand broken during the murder. The receipt's date being the day before would mean the light stand was present at the scene. If the testimony doesn't mention the light stand being broken, but the evidence shows it was, that's a contradiction. But the testimony focuses on the murder weapon, not the light stand. So maybe not.

Another possibility: The bellboy's affidavit (Evidence 12) describes the man who stayed with April. If that man is someone else, like Redd White (Character 7), but the testimony from April doesn't mention him. But that's not a direct contradiction.

Wait, let's consider Testimony 2: "Then the girl in the hippie clothes ran after her..." Hippie clothes refer to Maya. But if Maya's clothing is different, but that's not in the evidence. The description of Maya is "Found bent over her sister's body, crying." No mention of clothing. So no contradiction.

Wait, the wiretap (Evidence 7) in April's room suggests she was being monitored. If her testimony is based on what she heard via the wiretap, but she claims to have seen it, that would be a contradiction. For example, if the wiretap was recording the murder, and she wasn't present, but she testifies she saw it. So Evidence 7 (Wiretap in her room) contradicts her Testimony 0 ("I did see everything! I did!"). Because if the wiretap was in her room, maybe she heard it but didn't see it. But the problem is, the wiretap's presence doesn't directly prove she wasn't there. Unless the affidavit (Evidence 12) says she was in the hotel, but the murder happened at Fey & Co. Law Offices. So if the bellboy's affidavit says April was at the hotel on the night of the murder, and the murder happened at the law office, then April couldn't have been present. Therefore, her testimony that she saw it is contradicted by the bellboy's affidavit placing her elsewhere.

Ah, this seems promising. Let's check:

Testimony 0: April says "I did see everything! I did!"

Evidence 12: Bellboy's Affidavit describes the man who stayed with Miss May in the hotel on the night of the murder. If the bellboy's statement places April at the hotel during the time of the murder (9 PM), then she couldn't have been at the law office to witness it. Thus, her testimony that she saw everything is contradicted by the affidavit proving she was at the hotel.

Yes, this makes sense. The murder occurred at 9 PM at the Fey & Co. Law Offices. The bellboy's affidavit (Evidence 12) states that April was at the hotel that night with a man. Therefore, April couldn't have been present at the law office to witness the murder. Hence, her testimony (Testimony 0) claiming she saw everything contradicts the bellboy's evidence placing her elsewhere.

{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 0}

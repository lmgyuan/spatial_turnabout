Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. I need to go through each testimony and check if any evidence directly contradicts it. 

First, let's look at the testimonies from Lamiroir. Testimony 2 says: "I did not return backstage after the second set." But Testimony 3 states: "When my performance was finished, I went backstage for just a moment..." Wait, these two seem conflicting. Wait, no, maybe not. Let me check the context.

Wait, Testimony 2 is about not returning after the second set. Testimony 3 mentions going backstage after the performance. Wait, perhaps the performance was part of the second set? Or maybe the timing is different. Hmm, I need to cross-reference with the evidence.

Looking at the evidences, Evidence 9 (Crime Photo) mentions the victim was shot in Lamiroir's room. Also, Evidence 10 (Diagram) says the crime scene was her dressing room, and the victim was blocked from sight. But how does this relate to her testimonies?

Wait, in Testimony 3, Lamiroir says she went backstage after her performance. But Testimony 2 says she didn't return backstage after the second set. Maybe the second set refers to the same time as her performance. If she went backstage after her performance (Testimony 3), but Testimony 2 says she didn't return after the second set, that would be a contradiction if the performance was part of the second set.

Alternatively, perhaps the key contradiction is elsewhere. Let's look at another angle. Testimony 5 from Lamiroir: "I saw bullet holes in the wall, and knew Mr. LeTouse had been shot..." But Evidence 10 (Diagram) says that the victim was blocked from sight by items, and when looking from the door, the victim wasn't visible. So how could Lamiroir see the bullet holes if the body was blocked? Unless she entered the room. But she claims in Testimony 4: "I saw nothing. The late Mr. LeTouse's body was behind a wall." So if she didn't see the body because it was behind a wall, but in Testimony 5 she says she saw bullet holes, that could be a contradiction. Because the bullet holes are on the wall where the door was, according to Evidence 10. Maybe she couldn't see them without entering the room or having a clear view. But according to Testimony 4, she didn't see the body because it was behind a wall. So if the bullet holes were on the door wall, perhaps she could see them from the doorway without seeing the body. But the Diagram (Evidence 10) says "Observing from the door, the victim was blocked from sight by items." So if she looked in from the door, she couldn't see the victim, but maybe could see the bullet holes on the wall. However, Testimony 5 says she saw the bullet holes, which would be possible if she was at the door. But how does that contradict?

Alternatively, maybe another testimony. Let's check Testimony 4: "I saw nothing. The late Mr. LeTouse's body was behind a wall." Then in Testimony 5, she says she saw bullet holes. But if the bullet holes were in the same area as the body, which was blocked by items, how could she see the bullet holes? Unless the bullet holes were on a different wall. According to Evidence 10, "Two bullet holes were found on the wall where the door was." So the bullet holes are on the door's wall. So if she was at the door, she could see those bullet holes. But the victim's body was blocked by items from the door's viewpoint. So maybe she could see the bullet holes without seeing the body, which is possible. So Testimony 5 doesn't contradict that. Hmm.

Wait, looking at Testimony 0: "As for what I saw... I saw nothing." But then in Testimony 5 she says she saw bullet holes. That's a direct contradiction. But wait, Testimony 0 is a general statement, but maybe specific to a certain time. Let me check the exact wording. Testimony 0: "As for what I saw... I saw nothing." Person: Lamiroir. Testimony 5: "I saw bullet holes in the wall, and knew Mr. LeTouse had been shot..." So Testimony 0 claims she saw nothing, but Testimony 5 says she saw bullet holes. That's a contradiction between her own testimonies. However, the question asks for evidence and testimony that contradict. So perhaps evidence that shows she must have seen something contradicts her testimony of seeing nothing.

Alternatively, let's look at Evidence 9 (Crime Photo): the victim was lying with smeared writing in blood next to his right hand. If Lamiroir was at the scene, perhaps she could have seen that. But her testimonies say she didn't see the body. Wait, but maybe she didn't enter the room. Alternatively, the key is in the Headset (Evidence 12). The headset has a 30-foot range, and all staff wore one. If Lamiroir was wearing the headset, perhaps she could have heard something. But that's not directly related.

Wait, another angle: Testimony 3 says she went backstage after her performance. If that's when the murder happened, but the autopsy report (Evidence 8) says time of death was 9:00-9:30 PM. If her performance ended after that time, then her being backstage would be after the murder. But I need to check if there's a timeline conflict. Maybe the concert's timeline isn't clear here.

Alternatively, looking at the Revolver (Evidence 5) which is LeTouse's gun. If Lamiroir claims she didn't return backstage, but evidence shows the gun was there, maybe. Not sure.

Wait, another possibility: Testimony 3 says "When my performance was finished, I went backstage for just a moment..." But Evidence 11 is a Video Tape of Lamiroir's performance. If the video shows that she didn't go backstage, that would contradict. But the details of the video aren't provided. However, the user might expect me to find a contradiction between Testimony 2 and 3. Wait, Testimony 2: "I did not return backstage after the second set." Testimony 3: "When my performance was finished, I went backstage for just a moment..." So if the performance was part of the second set, then Testimony 3 contradicts Testimony 2. But the user is looking for a contradiction between evidence and testimony, not between two testimonies. So that's not the case here.

Wait, let's consider Testimony 6: "Then I was led by the police to Mr. Gavin's dressing room..." If there's evidence that she was somewhere else, but I don't see that.

Looking back at the Diagram (Evidence 10), it says that the crime scene was Lamiroir's dressing room, and from the door, the victim was blocked by items. The bullet holes were on the door's wall. If Lamiroir entered her own dressing room, she would have seen the body. But in Testimony 4 she says she saw nothing because the body was behind a wall. Wait, if the room is her dressing room, and she went backstage (Testimony 3), maybe she went to her dressing room. But in that case, if the body was in her dressing room, and she entered, she would have seen it. But Testimony 4 says she didn't see the body because it was behind a wall. So maybe she didn't enter the room. How? Maybe she went backstage but not to her own room. But if the crime happened in her room, and she went backstage, perhaps she was in a different area.

Wait, let's think again. The key contradiction is between Testimony 4 and Evidence 9. Testimony 4: "I saw nothing. The late Mr. LeTouse's body was behind a wall." But Evidence 9's crime photo shows that the victim's body was in Lamiroir's room, and there's smeared writing in blood next to his right hand. If Lamiroir entered her room, she would have seen the body. But she claims she didn't see it because it was behind a wall. However, the Diagram (Evidence 10) states that from the door, the victim was blocked by items, so she might have just glanced in without entering, hence not seeing the body. So that's possible. Then where's the contradiction?

Alternatively, Testimony 5: "I saw bullet holes in the wall..." But according to Evidence 10, the bullet holes were on the door's wall. If she was at the door, she could see the bullet holes without seeing the body. So that's possible. No contradiction there.

Wait, let's check Evidence 4: Brooch found at the crime scene, belonging to Lamiroir. If she claims she didn't return to the crime scene (her dressing room), but her brooch was found there, that's a contradiction. Which testimony would that contradict? Let's see. Testimony 2: "I did not return backstage after the second set." Testimony 3: "I went backstage for just a moment..." If the crime scene is backstage, and her brooch was found there, then she must have been there, contradicting Testimony 2 if the second set was after she went backstage. Wait, the timeline is a bit unclear. If the second set was her performance, and after that she went backstage (Testimony 3), then Testimony 2 says she didn't return backstage after the second set. That would be a contradiction between Testimony 2 and 3. But the user wants evidence and testimony. The Brooch (Evidence 4) is found at the crime scene (her dressing room), which is backstage. If she claims she didn't return backstage after the second set (Testimony 2), but her brooch was found there, that's a contradiction. So Evidence 4 contradicts Testimony 2. Because she must have been there to leave the brooch, but Testimony 2 says she didn't return backstage after the second set. That seems like a solid contradiction.

{"evidence": 4, "testimony": 2}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies, and I need to pick one pair where the evidence contradicts a testimony.

First, I should look through each testimony and check if any of the evidence directly contradicts it. Let's start by listing out the testimonies given by Ema. There are six of them.

Testimony 0: Ema says Machi stole the body because of some lyrics. Evidence related to lyrics is Evidence 2 (Lyrics Sheet) and maybe Evidence 16 (Borginian Newspaper, which mentions the ballad's lyrics aren't mentioned). Not sure yet.

Testimony 1: Moving the body to match Lamiroir's song. Again, lyrics might be involved here. The crime scene details (Evidence 9 and 10) might be relevant. The photo shows a blood smeared writing, which could relate to the song if the lyrics mention something specific. But need to check contradictions.

Testimony 2: No one in the country had a motive. But some evidence might show a motive. For example, Evidence 18 (Replica) is about a cocoon replica related to incuritis, and Evidence 19 (Newspaper Article) talks about the Chief Justice's son having incuritis. Maybe LeTouse was investigating something related to the cocoon, which could be a motive if someone wanted to stop him. If LeTouse was involved in a case that affects someone in the country, that might contradict Ema's claim that there's no motive. But the country in question here—Ema says "this country," but where is the crime taking place? The characters include people from Borginia (Lamiroir and Machi), but LeTouse is an interpreter. If the crime is in a different country, maybe someone from Borginia had a motive. But the testimony says "this country," so maybe the local people. But perhaps the evidence shows a motive. Let me think. If LeTouse had the replica related to incuritis, which is a disease affecting the Chief Justice's son, maybe someone wanted the cocoon for the cure. If the replica is key, then maybe someone from the country (where the crime happened) did have a motive. But I'm not sure. Maybe Evidence 18 and 19 could contradict Testimony 2, but I need to check.

Testimony 3: Machi left his signature. Ema claims that Machi left evidence pointing to himself. But if Machi is blind (Character 5), maybe some evidence contradicts that. For example, Testimony 5 says the shooter was blind. If the shooter was blind, and Machi is blind, that aligns. But maybe some evidence contradicts the idea that Machi left a signature. Wait, Testimony 3 says "Machi practically left his signature at the scene." What could that signature be? If Machi is blind, perhaps the way the crime was committed required sight, but that's not necessarily the case. Alternatively, maybe the crime scene has something a blind person couldn't do. Let's look at Evidence 9: the crime photo shows smeared writing in blood next to the victim's right hand. If the victim wrote something, but Machi is blind, maybe he couldn't have written that. Wait, but the victim is LeTouse, right? So the writing would be by the victim, not the perpetrator. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the shooter being blind (Testimony 5) is supported by some evidence, but if there's evidence that contradicts that the shooter was blind, then Testimony 5 would be contradicted. But the question is to find which evidence contradicts which testimony.

Wait, Testimony 5 says Ema concluded the shooter was blind. Let's check Evidence 5: Revolver, which is the murder weapon, belonging to LeTouse. If the shooter used LeTouse's gun, but LeTouse was the victim, then maybe the shooter took the gun from him. But how does that relate to being blind? Maybe if the shooter was blind, they couldn't aim properly, but the autopsy report (Evidence 8) says death was from a gunshot wound. The crime photo (Evidence 9) mentions the victim was shot in the shoulder. If the shooter was blind, perhaps they shot from close range, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the Revolver (Evidence 5) is a high-caliber weapon that requires good aim, which a blind person might not have. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, Testimony 3 says Machi left his signature, which could refer to something only a blind person would do. But maybe there's evidence showing that the signature couldn't have been left by a blind person. For example, the Key Ring (Evidence 6) found in the victim's left hand. If Machi is blind, would he have been able to place the key ring in a specific hand? Maybe not, unless he felt for it, but that's not a direct contradiction. Let me think again.

Looking at Testimony 5: Ema says the shooter was blind. But maybe there's evidence that the shooter needed to see. For instance, Evidence 13 (Switch → Remote Trigger) found on the stage, which triggers an igniter within 30 feet. If the shooter needed to activate the remote trigger from a certain distance, maybe that requires sight. Alternatively, the Headset (Evidence 12) has a 30-foot range. If the shooter used the headset, they would need to be within range. But how does that relate to being blind? Hmm.

Wait, Evidence 15 (Igniter) is found at the crime scene and is identical to the one in Gavin's guitar. The Remote Trigger (Evidence 13) works within 30 feet. If the shooter used the remote trigger to activate the igniter, which was part of the murder method, then the shooter needed to be within 30 feet. But if the shooter was blind, maybe they couldn't position themselves accurately. But that's not a direct contradiction.

Alternatively, Testimony 5 says the shooter was blind, but maybe the Revolver (Evidence 5) requires sight to use effectively. For example, aiming a revolver. However, a blind person might not be able to aim properly, leading to a missed shot. But the victim was shot in the shoulder. If the shooter was close, maybe even a blind person could hit. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, looking at Evidence 9 (Crime Photo): the victim was lying with his face turned to the left, and there's smeared writing in blood next to his right hand. If the victim wrote something, but Machi is blind, maybe he couldn't have written that. Wait, but the victim is LeTouse, so he wrote it. Unless the smeared writing was done by the killer. But the photo says the writing is next to the victim's right hand, implying he wrote it. So that's not directly related to the shooter being blind.

Wait, Testimony 5 says the shooter was blind, but if there's evidence that the shooter had to see something. For example, the Mixing Board (Evidence 7) allows music to be played in separate tracks. If the shooter needed to coordinate with music cues, maybe that requires sight. But not sure.

Alternatively, Evidence 10 (Diagram) shows that the crime scene had two bullet holes on the wall where the door was. If the shooter was blind, maybe they fired randomly, leading to multiple shots. But if the Revolver is a revolver, maybe it holds multiple bullets. However, the presence of two bullet holes might indicate multiple shots, which a blind shooter could do. Not a direct contradiction.

Hmm. Maybe another angle. Let's look at Testimony 3: "Machi practically left his signature at the scene." If Ema is saying that Machi left a signature, perhaps implying something that only he would do, but if Machi is blind, maybe the signature is something a blind person couldn't have done. For example, the Key Ring (Evidence 6) was found in the victim's left hand. If Machi is blind, would he know which hand to place it in? Maybe not, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, the Revolver (Evidence 5) belongs to LeTouse. If Machi stole it, but being blind, how would he know where to find it? But that's not evidence contradicting the testimony.

Wait, let's check Testimony 0: Ema says Machi stole the body because of some lyrics. The lyrics are in Evidence 2 (Lyrics Sheet). If the lyrics contain something that would incriminate Machi, but Evidence 16 (Borginian Newspaper) says the article doesn't mention the lyrics. So if the lyrics were a secret, maybe Machi had no reason to know about them, hence contradicting the testimony. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, Testimony 2: "No one in this country had a motive to kill the victim." If there's evidence that someone in the country did have a motive. For example, Evidence 18 (Replica) is a Borginian Cocoon replica, which LeTouse was investigating. If the motive is related to the cocoon and incuritis, and the Chief Justice's son (Evidence 19) has incuritis, maybe someone in the country (where the crime occurred) wanted the cocoon for the cure, thus giving them a motive. But Ema says "this country" had no motive. If the crime took place in Borginia, then the replica is from there. But the characters include Lamiroir and Machi from Borginia, but LeTouse is an interpreter. Maybe the crime is in a different country, so "this country" refers to that place. For example, if the crime is in the country where the Sunshine Coliseum is located (maybe not Borginia), then someone from Borginia (like Lamiroir or Machi) might have a motive, but Ema's testimony says no one in "this country" (the local country) had a motive. If Evidence 18 and 19 indicate a motive related to Borginia, then Ema's Testimony 2 is contradicted because the motive is from another country, which would align with her statement. Wait, no. If the motive is from Borginia, then people in "this country" (not Borginia) don't have a motive, which would support Ema's Testimony 2. But if there's evidence that someone in "this country" did have a motive, that would contradict. Hmm.

Alternatively, Evidence 4 (Brooch) belongs to Lamiroir, found at the crime scene. If Lamiroir is from Borginia, but the crime is in another country, then her brooch being there might indicate her presence, but that doesn't directly relate to motive. 

Let me think again. The key is to find a direct contradiction between a piece of evidence and a testimony. Let's look at Testimony 5: Ema says the shooter was blind. But if there's evidence that the shooter needed to see, that would contradict. For example, the Remote Trigger (Evidence 13) requires line of sight to trigger within 30 feet. If the shooter had to trigger it from the stage (where the trigger was found) to the crime scene (dressing room), but the range is 30 feet, maybe the distance is more than that, requiring the shooter to be in proximity. But the exact layout isn't clear. The Diagram (Evidence 14) is a cross-section of the Sunshine Coliseum. Maybe the distance from the stage to the dressing room is more than 30 feet, so the shooter had to be nearby. But if the shooter was blind, how would they know where to position themselves? Not sure.

Alternatively, the Headset (Evidence 12) has a 30-foot range. If the shooter used the headset to communicate, but was out of range, that might require them to be closer. But again, not directly related to being blind.

Wait, Testimony 5 says the shooter was blind. Evidence 9 (Crime Photo) shows the victim was shot in the shoulder, and there's smeared writing. If the shooter was blind, they might not aim precisely, but hitting the shoulder could be possible. However, the Revolver is a high-caliber weapon (Evidence 5), which might have recoil that a blind person couldn't handle as well. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, let's consider Evidence 5: Revolver belongs to LeTouse. If the shooter used LeTouse's own gun, maybe they had to take it from him. If the shooter was blind, how would they know where the gun is? But if LeTouse was the victim, maybe the shooter took the gun during a struggle. But that doesn't directly contradict.

Hmm. Maybe another angle. Testimony 3: Ema claims Machi left his signature. If the signature is related to being blind, but some evidence shows that the action required sight. For example, the Key Ring (Evidence 6) was found in the victim's left hand. If Machi is blind, placing the key in a specific hand might not be possible. But a blind person could feel which hand is left or right. Not sure.

Wait, the Crime Photo (Evidence 9) mentions the victim's face turned to the left, and the smeared writing is next to his right hand. If the victim wrote something with his right hand, but if Machi is blind, perhaps he couldn't have manipulated the victim's hand to write. But the victim could have written it himself. So that's not directly related.

Alternatively, the Diagram (Evidence 10) mentions the victim was blocked from sight by items. So the shooter had to know the victim's position despite the obstruction. If the shooter was blind, they couldn't see the victim, but maybe they used sound. But that's possible. Not a direct contradiction.

Hmm. Maybe I should focus on the most obvious contradiction. Let's look at Testimony 5: Ema says the shooter was blind. But Evidence 15 (Igniter) is identical to the one in Prosecutor Gavin's guitar (Evidence 17). The Igniter is triggered by the Remote Trigger (Evidence 13) within 30 feet. If the shooter needed to use the Remote Trigger to activate the Igniter, perhaps that requires seeing where to trigger it. If the shooter was blind, they couldn't see the igniter's location. However, if the igniter was placed in a known position, a blind person could activate it by memory or proximity. But the Remote Trigger has a 30-foot range, so the shooter had to be within 30 feet. If the crime scene (dressing room) and the stage (where the Remote Trigger was found) are more than 30 feet apart, then the shooter had to be near the stage to trigger it. But if the shooter was in the dressing room, they could trigger it there. Wait, the Igniter (Evidence 15) was found at the crime scene. So the Remote Trigger was used at the crime scene. If the shooter was in the dressing room, they could trigger it there, so range isn't an issue. Hmm.

Alternatively, the Revolver (Evidence 5) being a high-caliber weapon might require aiming, which a blind person couldn't do effectively. But the victim was shot in the shoulder, which might be a close-range shot. If the shooter was close, maybe they didn't need to aim precisely. But this is speculative.

Wait, what about Testimony 3: "Machi practically left his signature at the scene." If the signature refers to something only a blind person would do, but there's evidence that the action required sight. For example, the Lyrics Sheet (Evidence 2) could have lyrics that reference sight or require seeing to understand. But if Machi is blind, he couldn't read the lyrics. So if the motive for moving the body (Testimony 1) is based on the lyrics, but Machi couldn't read them, that would contradict Ema's Testimony 0 and 1. Specifically, Testimony 0 says Machi stole the body because of some lyrics. If the lyrics are in the Lyrics Sheet (Evidence 2), but Machi is blind and can't read them, that would mean he couldn't have known the lyrics, thus contradicting the testimony that he acted because of them. So Evidence 2 (Lyrics Sheet) would contradict Testimony 0, because Machi couldn't read the lyrics.

But wait, Machi is blind, but maybe the lyrics were communicated to him another way, like verbally. But the testimony says "because of some lyrics," implying he acted based on the content of the lyrics. If he couldn't read them and there's no evidence he heard them, then the existence of the lyrics as a motive is contradicted by his blindness. So the pair would be Evidence 2 (Lyrics Sheet) and Testimony 0. But let me check the testimonies again.

Testimony 0: "I believe Machi stole the body because of some lyrics." If the lyrics are in the lyrics sheet, and Machi can't read them because he's blind, then he couldn't have known the lyrics to act based on them. Unless someone told him, but there's no evidence of that. Therefore, Evidence 2 (the existence of the lyrics) contradicts Testimony 0 (Machi's motive being the lyrics) because Machi couldn't have read them. So that's a possible contradiction.

Alternatively, Testimony 5 says the shooter was blind. But if the Revolver (Evidence 5) belongs to LeTouse, and the shooter used it, perhaps the shooter had to take it from LeTouse. If the shooter was blind, how would they know where the gun is? But that's not directly contradictory.

Wait, but the Key Ring (Evidence 6) holds keys to a guitar case and a motorcycle. If the guitar case is related to Daryan Crescend (Character 7), the guitarist, maybe the keys are his. But not directly related.

Back to the earlier point: Testimony 0 claims Machi acted because of lyrics, but Machi is blind and couldn't read the lyrics. Therefore, Evidence 2 (Lyrics Sheet) contradicts Testimony 0. That seems plausible.

Alternatively, Testimony 3 says Machi left his signature, which could be the smeared blood writing. But if he's blind, maybe he couldn't write. However, the victim's right hand has the writing, so it's possible the victim wrote it. Not sure.

Alternatively, Testimony 5 (shooter was blind) and Evidence 5 (Revolver belonging to LeTouse). If the shooter used LeTouse's gun, but LeTouse was the victim, maybe the shooter took the gun from him. If the shooter was blind, they might not know where the gun is kept. But again, not a direct contradiction.

Another angle: Testimony 5 (shooter blind) and Evidence 9 (Crime Photo). The victim was shot in the shoulder. If the shooter was blind, maybe the bullet hole's location or the way the victim fell indicates proximity, which a blind person could manage. But not a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps Testimony 5 (shooter was blind) is contradicted by Evidence 15 (Igniter) and Evidence 13 (Remote Trigger). If the shooter used the Remote Trigger to set off the Igniter, but being blind, they couldn't see where the Igniter was placed. However, if the Igniter was planted beforehand, maybe the blind person didn't need to see it. But this is not a direct contradiction.

Going back to the initial thought: Testimony 0 says Machi stole the body because of lyrics, but Machi is blind and couldn't read the lyrics. Therefore, the existence of the lyrics (Evidence 2) contradicts the testimony's assertion that Machi acted based on them. So the pair would be Evidence 2 and Testimony 0.

Alternatively, Testimony 3 says Machi left his signature. If the signature is something that requires sight, like positioning the body in a certain way that a blind person couldn't, but there's no evidence directly stating that. 

Another possibility: Testimony 3 says Machi left his signature, which could be the Key Ring (Evidence 6) in the victim's left hand. If Machi is blind, maybe he couldn't know which hand is left, but a blind person can distinguish left and right through touch (e.g., rings on a specific hand). Not sure.

Alternatively, the Brooch (Evidence 4) belongs to Lamiroir, found at the scene. If the crime scene was Lamiroir's room (Evidence 10), that's expected. Not related.

Hmm. Let's think again. The most solid contradiction seems to be between Testimony 0 (Machi acted because of lyrics) and the fact that Machi is blind (Character 5), so he couldn't read the lyrics. But the evidence related to lyrics is Evidence 2. However, the testimony is about the motive (because of some lyrics), and the evidence is the lyrics sheet. If the lyrics sheet is written, and Machi can't read, then he couldn't have known the lyrics to act on them. Therefore, Evidence 2 (Lyrics Sheet) contradicts Testimony 0 (Machi's motive being the lyrics). So the pair would be {"evidence": 2, "testimony": 0}.

But wait, the user might consider that the testimony is from Ema, and the evidence is the lyrics sheet. If Ema claims Machi acted because of the lyrics, but Machi can't read them, then the existence of the lyrics sheet doesn't directly contradict unless it's proven that Machi had no access to the lyrics through other means. For example, if someone read them to him. But there's no evidence of that. So this is a possible contradiction.

Alternatively, Testimony 5 (shooter was blind) and Evidence 5 (Revolver). If the revolver is a high-caliber gun that requires aiming, but the shooter was blind, that's a contradiction. But this is more of a logical deduction rather than direct evidence.

But the problem states to use the provided evidences and testimonies. So the answer should be based on the given data. The user instructions say "which evidence and testimony contradict each other."

So, considering all possibilities, the most direct contradiction is between Testimony 5 (shooter was blind) and Evidence 15 (Igniter) and 13 (Remote Trigger). If the igniter was triggered by a remote that requires line of sight or precise positioning, a blind person couldn't do that. But the Remote Trigger has a 30-foot range. If the shooter was within 30 feet, maybe they could activate it without seeing. Not sure.

Alternatively, Testimony 5 (shooter was blind) and Evidence 9 (Crime Photo) which shows smeared writing. If the writing was done by the shooter, but the shooter was blind, that's a contradiction. But the photo says the writing is next to the victim's right hand, implying the victim wrote it. So not the shooter.

Wait, the Crime Photo's caption says: "There is smeared writing in blood on the floor in front of his head next to his right hand." Since the victim was shot, maybe he wrote something before dying. If the victim wrote it, then the shooter's blindness is unrelated. So no contradiction there.

Going back, the strongest contradiction seems to be Testimony 0 and Evidence 2. Because Machi is blind and can't read the lyrics, so he couldn't have acted because of them. But the testimony says he did. Therefore, the lyrics sheet (Evidence 2) contradicts Testimony 0.

{"evidence": 2, "testimony": 0}

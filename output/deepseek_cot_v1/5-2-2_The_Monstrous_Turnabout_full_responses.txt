Okay, let me try to figure this out. The task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let's start by going through the testimonies and the evidences one by one.

First, the testimonies are all from Fulbright. Let's list them out:

Testimony 0: Alderman Kyubi was murdered with a spear from the wall.
Testimony 1: Damian Tenma's fingerprints on the murder weapon.
Testimony 2: Kyubi was asleep due to a drug.
Testimony 3: Mayor Tenma attacked, impaling him with a spear.
Testimony 4: Victim woke up, grabbed a statue, struck back.

Now, the evidence. Let's look for any contradictions here. 

Looking at Testimony 3, Fulbright claims that Mayor Tenma impaled Kyubi with the spear. But wait, the Autopsy Report (Evidence 14) says cause of death is a spear stab, time around 3:20 PM. The Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows Kyubi impaled by a spear, and the mayor (Damian Tenma) is in a sofa with head injury. The Fox and Demon Statue (Evidence 7) is the weapon used to bludgeon the mayor, and there's blood on it but no fingerprints. 

Wait, Testimony 3 says Mayor Tenma attacked with the spear, but the statue was the weapon used on the mayor. Also, according to Testimony 4, the victim (Kyubi) grabbed the statue and struck back. But the statue is the weapon that hit the mayor. So the statue was used by Kyubi to hit the mayor, but the mayor was found unconscious. However, if Kyubi was stabbed by the spear (Testimony 3), and then he grabbed the statue to hit the mayor, but the autopsy says Kyubi was killed by the spear. So after being stabbed, he would be dead, but Testimony 4 says he woke up and struck back. That's a contradiction in the timeline. But how does this relate to evidence?

Looking at Evidence 7 (Fox and Demon Statue): It says the statue was the weapon used to bludgeon the mayor, and his blood was on it, but no fingerprints. Testimony 1 says Damian Tenma's fingerprints were on the murder weapon. But if the murder weapon is the spear (Testimony 0 and 3), but Testimony 1 says fingerprints on the murder weapon. But if the actual murder weapon is the spear, and the statue was used against the mayor, then Testimony 1's claim about fingerprints on the murder weapon (spear) would contradict if Damian's fingerprints are not there. But wait, Evidence 7 states that the statue (used on the mayor) had no fingerprints. But Testimony 1 says the defendant's (Damian's) fingerprints are on the murder weapon. If the murder weapon is the spear, then Testimony 1 would be contradicted if the spear doesn't have Damian's prints. But the evidence doesn't mention the spear's fingerprints. However, Evidence 9 (Crime Photo) mentions that neither of the men (Kyubi in beige suit, Damian in green) are wearing gloves. So if Damian used the spear, his fingerprints should be there, but maybe the spear wasn't tested? Hmm.

Wait, another angle. The Testimony 3 says Mayor Tenma attacked with the spear, impaling Kyubi. But according to the Autopsy Report (Evidence 14), Kyubi was asleep due to drugs. So if Kyubi was asleep, how did he grab the statue to strike back (Testimony 4)? Because Testimony 4 says that the victim (Kyubi) woke up due to the pain and struck back. But the Autopsy says he was in a drug-induced slumber. So maybe he was asleep, but the pain from being stabbed woke him up. But that's possible. Maybe the drug just made him drowsy but not completely unconscious. Not sure if that's a contradiction.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 1: fingerprints on the murder weapon. If the murder weapon is the spear (Testimony 0), but the statue (Evidence 7) was the weapon used on the mayor. The murder weapon (spear) would have Damian's fingerprints according to Testimony 1. But the Autopsy says Kyubi was killed by the spear. But if Damian's fingerprints were on the spear, that would incriminate him. However, the evidence regarding the statue (Evidence 7) says no fingerprints were found on it. If the murder weapon is the spear, and Testimony 1 says Damian's prints are on it, but there's no evidence presented about the spear's fingerprints. Wait, the given evidences don't mention the spear's fingerprints. The only evidence about fingerprints is on the statue (no prints) and the key (Evidence 17, no prints). So maybe Testimony 1 claims Damian's fingerprints are on the murder weapon (spear), but there's no evidence supporting that. But contradiction would require evidence that directly contradicts. For example, if evidence says there are no fingerprints on the spear, but Testimony 1 says there are. But we don't have such evidence. So that might not be the contradiction.

Wait, Evidence 9 (Crime Photo) mentions that neither of them are wearing gloves. So if Damian used the spear, his fingerprints should be on it. But Testimony 1 says his prints are on the murder weapon. However, if the murder weapon is actually the statue, which is what was used on Damian (mayor), then Testimony 1 is wrong because the statue has no fingerprints. But Testimony 1 refers to the murder weapon as the one that killed Kyubi, which is the spear. So Testimony 1 is about the spear, but the evidence only mentions the statue's lack of prints. So maybe that's not a contradiction.

Wait another angle: The Forbidden Chamber Key (Evidence 17) was swallowed by the mayor, and it has no fingerprints. The key is unique. Testimony 4 says the victim (Kyubi) grabbed the statue and struck back, implying that the key was taken during that struggle. The key was swallowed by the mayor (Damian), so maybe the key was taken from the killer. If the killer had the key, but the key has no fingerprints, perhaps indicating the killer wore gloves. But the Crime Photo (Evidence 9) says neither were wearing gloves. So that's a possible contradiction. But how does this relate to a testimony?

Alternatively, Testimony 3 claims that Mayor Tenma attacked Kyubi with the spear, but according to the Autopsy (Evidence 14), Kyubi was asleep from a drug, which is stated in Testimony 2. Wait, Testimony 2 is from Fulbright and says the same as the autopsy. So that's not a contradiction. 

Looking back at Testimony 4: The victim (Kyubi) grabbed the statue and struck back. The statue (Evidence 7) was the weapon used to bludgeon the mayor. The statue has the mayor's blood but no fingerprints. But if Kyubi grabbed it, why are there no fingerprints? Because Kyubi wasn't wearing gloves (Crime Photo), so his prints should be on the statue. But Evidence 7 says no fingerprints. That's a contradiction. So Testimony 4 says Kyubi grabbed the statue and struck back, which should leave his fingerprints. But Evidence 7 says no fingerprints. Therefore, Testimony 4 is contradicted by Evidence 7. 

So the pair would be Evidence 7 and Testimony 4. Let me check:

Testimony 4: Victim grabbed the statue and struck back. If that's true, there should be fingerprints from the victim (Kyubi) on the statue. But Evidence 7 says no fingerprints could be lifted from the statue. That's a contradiction. Hence, Testimony 4 is contradicted by Evidence 7.

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 4}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's start by understanding what the question is asking. We need to find a pair where the evidence contradicts a testimony. The characters, evidences, and testimonies are all provided, so I need to go through each testimony and see if any of the evidence directly contradicts it.

First, let me look at the testimonies. All four testimonies (0 to 4) are from Fulbright. Testimony 4 says that Mayor Tenma killed the alderman after planting feathers and tracks to make it look like a yokai. But according to the evidence, maybe there's something that shows the mayor couldn't have done it.

Looking at the evidence list, let's see. The Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows two men: one in a beige suit impaled with a spear, the other in a green suit with head blood. The autopsy report (14) says Kyubi was stabbed with a spear, time of death around 3:20 PM. The mayor (Damian Tenma) was found unconscious at the crime scene. If the mayor was unconscious, how could he have killed Kyubi? Wait, the testimony says the mayor killed the alderman after planting evidence. But if the mayor was found unconscious, maybe he was attacked himself. Also, the Forbidden Chamber Key (17) was swallowed by the mayor, which he took from the killer. If the mayor had the key, which he took from the real killer, that implies someone else was the killer, not the mayor. So if Fulbright's Testimony 4 claims the mayor killed Kyubi, but the key evidence shows the mayor took the key from the actual killer, then Testimony 4 is contradicted by Evidence 17. Because if the mayor was the killer, he wouldn't need to take the key from himself. Therefore, the key being swallowed by the mayor suggests he took it from someone else, meaning the killer is someone else, contradicting the testimony that the mayor did it.

{"evidence": 17, "testimony": 4}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's start by looking through the provided information. The task is to find a contradiction between one piece of evidence and one testimony.

First, I'll review the testimonies given by Filch. There are four of them. Testimony 0 says he was on guard duty in the foyer as Mr. Kyubi asked. Testimony 1 mentions he was making sure no one could get to the guest. Testimony 2 claims he was in his office keeping watch when the murder happened after 3 PM. Testimony 3 states he didn't see anything out of the ordinary.

Now, looking at the evidence. Let's check each one for possible contradictions. Evidence 6 is the Foyer Diagram, which includes Filch's office. His testimony 2 says he was in his office during the murder. But wait, if he was in his office, could he really be guarding the foyer effectively? Also, evidence 13 is the TV Listings. The TV program at 3 PM was circled, and Filch admitted he watched the wrestling match which was a disaster. The murder time was around 3:20 PM according to the autopsy (Evidence 14). So if Filch was watching TV at 3 PM, which might have overlapped with the murder time, he might not have been keeping a good watch as he claims in Testimony 2. That's a contradiction because he was supposed to be on guard duty but was distracted by the TV.

Another angle: Evidence 10 is the Amazing Nine-Tails Mask with white hair inside. Rex Kyubi had white hair (Character 4). If the mask was found with his hair, maybe Filch encountered him. But how does that tie to Filch's testimony? Not sure.

Wait, Filch's Testimony 3 says he didn't see anything unusual, but Evidence 12 is Jinxie's statement about a demon fleeing toward the foyer. If the demon (maybe the killer) went to the foyer, Filch should have seen something if he was really watching. But he claims he saw nothing. So the contradiction here would be between Jinxie's Statement (Evidence 12) and Filch's Testimony 3. However, the question asks for evidence and testimony that contradict each other directly. Alternatively, maybe the TV Listings (Evidence 13) and Filch's Testimony 2. Because he was watching TV (as per the conversation in Evidence 13's caption) during the time he was supposed to be on guard duty, which would mean he wasn't actually keeping a good watch. So Testimony 2 says he was in his office keeping watch, but Evidence 13 shows he was watching TV, which contradicts his claim of keeping a good watch. Therefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 13 and Testimony 2 or 3.

Wait, Testimony 2: "I was still in my office keeping a good watch when the murder happened after 3 PM." But if he was watching TV at 3 PM (as per Evidence 13's TV Listings and his admission in the dialogue), then he wasn't keeping a good watch. So the TV evidence (13) contradicts his statement that he was keeping a good watch (Testimony 2). That would be the contradiction. So the answer would be Evidence 13 and Testimony 2. Let me check again.

In Evidence 13, the TV Listings show that at 3 PM there's a wrestling program. Filch says in the testimony that he watched it and it was a disaster. The murder occurred around 3:20 PM. So during the time leading up to the murder, Filch was watching TV instead of guarding. Therefore, his Testimony 2 that he was "keeping a good watch" is contradicted by Evidence 13, which shows he was distracted by the TV. That seems like a solid contradiction. So the pair would be Evidence 13 and Testimony 2. But let's confirm the testimony numbers. Testimony 2 is: "I was still in my office keeping a good watch when the murder happened after 3 PM." So if he was watching TV in his office, then he wasn't keeping a good watch. Therefore, the evidence (TV Listings, 13) contradicts Testimony 2. Alternatively, if Filch's office is part of the foyer (as per Evidence 6's diagram), then maybe he was in the office but watching TV instead of guarding. Therefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 13 (he watched TV) and Testimony 2 (keeping a good watch). That makes sense. So the answer should be Evidence 13 and Testimony 2.

{"evidence": 13, "testimony": 2}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. So, I need to look through the given testimonies and see which one is contradicted by one of the evidences.

First, let's look at the testimonies given by Filch. He's the caretaker who was supposedly guarding the entrance. His testimonies are about him watching a pro wrestling match on TV and claiming that he would have heard anyone passing by because the floor is creaky. Testimony 3 says, "If Tenma Taro was to pass by, his staff woulda gone jingle jangle." And Testimony 4 concludes that there was no Tenma Taro in the foyer.

Now, looking at the evidence. Evidence 7 is the Fox and Demon Statue, which mentions that it was wrapped in a large cloth and was used to bludgeon the mayor. But importantly, it says that Jinxie is now the only one who knows what the original statue looked like. Wait, maybe that's not directly related. Let's check other evidences.

Evidence 10 is the Amazing Nine-Tails Mask, which has white hair inside. The Amazing Nine-Tails is a wrestler (Character 2), and the mask might belong to him. The white hair could be from Rex Kyubi, the deceased, since he had snow-white hair. But how does this relate to the testimony?

Looking at Testimony 3 again: Filch claims that Tenma Taro's staff would make noise. But according to Evidence 1, the Yokai Legend Scroll, Tenma Taro does not wield any weapon. The scroll is the sole document showing his appearance, and it says he doesn't have a staff. So if Tenma Taro doesn't have a staff, then Filch's testimony about hearing a jingle jangle from a staff is impossible. Therefore, Filch's Testimony 3 is contradicted by Evidence 1. Because the scroll clearly states Tenma Taro doesn't carry any weapon, so there's no staff to make noise. That means Filch is lying or mistaken because he's assuming Tenma Taro has a staff, which the evidence shows he doesn't. That's a contradiction.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the user is asking which evidence and testimony contradict each other, and I need to find one pair. Let me start by going through all the provided information.

First, the characters. The key ones here are Redd White (Character 7), who is an eyewitness. His testimony is Testimony 0 to 9. The other important character is April May (Character 4), who also testifies against Maya. There's also the evidence list, which includes things like the Attorney's Badge, The Thinker (the murder weapon), Glass Shards, Receipt, Maya's Cell Phone, etc.

Looking at the testimonies by Redd White, he describes seeing a spiky-haired man attacking a woman. In Testimony 8, he says the victim ran to the left, and the attacker gave chase. But wait, Evidence 9 is the May Testimony, which states that the victim dodged an attack and ran to the right, then was caught and struck. So that's a contradiction in directionâ€”left vs. right.

Wait, but Evidence 9 is labeled as "May Testimony," which is April May's testimony. Wait, no, the Testimonies are listed with their person. The Testimony entries from 0 to 9 are all by White (Redd White). So Testimony 8 says the victim ran to the left, but another testimony (maybe from April May?) says right. Wait, no, the Testimonies provided here are all from White. Wait, the user provided Testimonies 0-9, all from White. So maybe looking elsewhere. Let me check the evidences again.

Evidence 9 is "May Testimony" which says the victim ran to the right. Wait, Evidence 9's description is: "The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck." So this is April May's testimony. But in Redd White's Testimony 8, he says the victim ran to the left. So here's the contradiction: White's Testimony 8 (victim ran left) vs. May's Testimony (Evidence 9 says victim ran right). But the user is asking for an evidence and a testimony that contradict. So if Evidence 9 is May's testimony, and Testimony 8 is White's, then they contradict each other. That would be the pair: Evidence 9 and Testimony 8.

Wait, but the question is to find which evidence and testimony contradict. So the testimony here is from White (Testimony 8) and the evidence is May's Testimony (Evidence 9). So that's the pair. The directions are conflicting. Therefore, the answer should be {"evidence": 9, "testimony": 8}.

Wait, but let me cross-check other possibilities. Let me check other evidence. For example, Evidence 3 is the Receipt which has a date the day before the murder. The Glass Shards (Evidence 2) are from a broken light stand. The Receipt (Evidence 3) is for a glass light stand purchased the day before. So maybe the glass shards are from that purchase, but if the murder happened at 9 PM, maybe there's a timeline issue. But how does that contradict a testimony?

Alternatively, the Floor Plans (Evidence 8) indicate that the stand is blocked from view. So if White's testimony says he saw the attack from across the way, but the floor plan shows the stand is blocked, maybe he couldn't have seen it. But which testimony would that contradict? Testimony 3 says he turned to look at the building across the way. If the stand is blocked, maybe he couldn't have seen the attack. But that would link Evidence 8 (Floor Plans) with Testimony 3 or 4. Let me check.

Testimony 4: "It was then I saw him: a spiky-haired man attacking a woman with long hair!" If the floor plan (Evidence 8) says the stand (where the attack happened?) is blocked from view, then White couldn't have seen that. So Evidence 8 and Testimony 4 would contradict. That's another possible pair.

So now I have two possible contradictions: one between Evidence 9 and Testimony 8 (left vs. right), and another between Evidence 8 and Testimony 4 (visibility). Which is the correct one?

Let me look at the Evidence 8 description: "The murder scene, the Fey & Co. Law Offices. The stand is blocked from view looking from the office." Wait, the stand is blocked from view when looking from the office. But White was in the building across the way, according to Testimony 3. So if the stand is blocked from the office's view, but White is looking from another building, maybe that's a different angle. The floor plan's exact details might matter here. If the stand's position is such that someone from across the building (like White's location) could see it, but not from within the office, then maybe his testimony is possible. But if the floor plan shows that from outside (across the way), the stand is visible, then no contradiction. This might be more ambiguous.

On the other hand, the direction contradiction (left vs. right) is more straightforward. Evidence 9 (May's Testimony) says the victim ran to the right, while Testimony 8 (White's) says left. So these two directly contradict each other. Therefore, that's a solid pair. So the answer should be {"evidence": 9, "testimony": 8}.

But wait, the user wants the evidence number and the testimony number. Evidence 9 is "May Testimony" (Evidence 9) and Testimony 8 is White's Testimony 8. So that's the pair. Therefore, the correct answer is {"evidence": 9, "testimony": 8}.

{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 8}
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to find which evidence contradicts a testimony. Let me first go through all the given information.

The characters are Mia Fey, Maya Fey, Detective Gumshoe, Edgeworth, April May, Marvin Grossberg, Bellboy, and Redd White. The evidences include things like the murder weapon (The Thinker statue/clock), glass shards, a receipt, autopsy report, Maya's cell phone, wiretap, floor plans, testimonies, photographs, and some memos.

The testimonies in question are all from Redd White (Testimony 0 to 6). He claims that the victim was attacked, ran left, was hit, then ran right and was struck again. He says this is what April May saw and that the victim was hit twice. But the key here is the autopsy report (Evidence 5) says the cause of death was a single blunt force trauma, and death was instantaneous, though there's a note that the victim may have lived a few minutes after being hit. Wait, the autopsy report seems conflicting with itself. It says "single blunt force trauma. Death was instantaneous." But then the description also says "May have lived for a few minutes after being hit." Hmm, maybe that's a typo or a mistake in the evidence. Anyway, the main point is that if the autopsy says death was from a single blow, then the testimonies that claim two blows would contradict that.

Looking at White's testimonies, Testimony 6 says "You see? You hit her twice!" which directly states two blows. But the autopsy report (Evidence 5) says single blunt force trauma. So this is a contradiction. Therefore, Evidence 5 (Mia's Autopsy Report) contradicts Testimony 6 by White. 

Wait, but I need to check other possibilities. Let's see other testimonies. Testimonies 1-4 describe the victim running left, being hit, then running right, and being hit again. So Testimony 6 is just summarizing that there were two hits. The Autopsy Report (Evidence 5) says single blow. So the contradiction is between the two hits (testimonies) and the single blow (evidence). 

Another possibility: The Thinker (Evidence 1) is the murder weapon, a statue/clock with gears removed. If the weapon was used once, but testimonies say two hits, but maybe the gears being removed could indicate something? Not sure. Alternatively, the receipt (Evidence 3) is for a glass light stand, which is the same as the glass shards (Evidence 2). The receipt's date is the day before the murder. Maybe the glass shards could be related to another event. But the main contradiction seems to be the number of blows. 

So the most direct contradiction is between the autopsy report (Evidence 5) stating a single blow and White's Testimony 6 (and others) claiming two blows. Therefore, the correct pair is Evidence 5 and Testimony 6. But wait, the autopsy report's description seems conflicting. The first line says "single blunt force trauma. Death was instantaneous." Then the next line says "May have lived for a few minutes after being hit." That might mean that the initial blow was fatal but she didn't die instantly. However, the key point is the cause is a single blow. So the testimony of two blows contradicts the autopsy's single cause. 

Therefore, the answer should be {"evidence": 5, "testimony": 6}.

{"evidence": 5, "testimony": 6}
Alright, let me try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other here. So, the task is to find a pair where the evidence directly contradicts a testimony given by one of the characters. Let me start by going through the testimonies and cross-referencing them with the evidence provided.

First, looking at the testimonies from Redd White (Testimonies 0 to 5). Let's see:

Testimony 0: He says he looked at the other window when he heard something fall. Then in Testimony 1, he mentions a light stand lying on the floor when he looked. Testimony 2 says Mia ran to the left, Testimony 3 says the killer attacked but she dodged, Testimony 4 she ran for the door, and Testimony 5 he claims the killer struck her with a single blow.

Now, looking at the evidence. Evidence 3 is a receipt for a glass light stand purchased the day before the murder. Evidence 2 is glass shards from a broken light stand. But according to Testimony 1, Redd White saw a light stand lying on the floor. However, if the receipt shows that the light stand was purchased the day before, but the glass shards are broken beyond recognition, that might imply the light stand was broken. But maybe there's a contradiction here. Wait, the receipt is for the purchase, so the light stand was present. But if the glass shards are the remains, then the light stand was broken. So if White says he saw the light stand lying on the floor (intact?), but the evidence shows it was broken into shards, that's a contradiction. So Testimony 1 (saying a light stand was on the floor) versus Evidence 2 (glass shards, broken beyond recognition) would be a contradiction here. So if he saw a light stand lying on the floor, but the evidence shows it was shattered into pieces, that's conflicting.

Additionally, looking at Testimony 3 and 5: White says the victim dodged an attack and then was struck with a single blow. But the autopsy report (Evidence 5) states that the cause was a single blunt force trauma, but it also mentions that the death was instantaneous, yet "may have lived for a few minutes after being hit." Wait, the autopsy report has conflicting information in its description? The first line says death was instantaneous, but the second line says may have lived a few minutes. Hmm, maybe a typo. But regardless, Testimony 9 (from May) says the victim dodged, ran to the right, was caught and struck. But that's not part of White's testimony. Wait, Testimony 9 is labeled as "May Testimony" which is April May? Wait, the testimonies provided here are only from White (Testimonies 0-5). Wait, the Testimonies section lists Testimony 0 to 5 as being from White. Then Testimony 9 is "May Testimony" (April May's testimony), which is separate. But in the given data, the user provided Testimonies 0 to 5 (all White's), and others like Testimony 9 (May's). Wait, the user's input lists Testimonies 0-5 under Testimonies, each with a 'Person' field. Testimony 0-5 are by White. Then Testimony 9 is May's. So perhaps the contradiction is between Redd White's testimony and some evidence.

Looking again at Testimony 3: "The killer attacked her... but she dodged." Then Testimony 5: "Then you did her in with a single blow." The autopsy report (Evidence 5) says "single blunt force trauma. Death was instantaneous." But in the description, it says "May have lived for a few minutes after being hit." Wait, that seems contradictory. But perhaps the key contradiction is elsewhere.

Another angle: Testimony 2 by White says Mia ran to the left, but May's testimony (Testimony 9) says she ran to the right. But the user is asking for a pair between evidence and testimony, not testimony vs testimony. So must focus on evidence vs testimony.

Looking at Testimony 3: "the killer attacked her... but she dodged." Then Testimony 5: "Then you did her in with a single blow." If the murder weapon is The Thinker (Evidence 1), which is a statue clock with gears removed. The attack was a single blow. The autopsy report (Evidence 5) says single blunt force trauma, which aligns. So maybe not that.

Alternatively, the Floor Plans (Evidence 8) state that the stand is blocked from view looking from the office. If White claims he saw the attack, but the floor plan shows that the stand (where the attack happened?) was blocked from view, then he couldn't have seen it. Wait, the floor plan description says "the stand is blocked from view looking from the office." So if White was in a position where the stand was blocked, then his testimony about seeing the attack would be impossible, hence contradicting the floor plan evidence. So Evidence 8 (Floor Plans) contradicts Testimony 3 or 5, where he claims to have seen the attack. For example, if the murder happened near the stand, and the stand was blocked from the office view, then White, who was in the office, couldn't have seen the attack. So the contradiction would be between Testimony 3 (attacker dodged, etc.) and Evidence 8 (blocked view). Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 8 and Testimony 3. That seems plausible.

Another possible contradiction: The receipt (Evidence 3) is for a glass light stand purchased the day before. Testimony 1 (White) says he saw a light stand lying on the floor. But Evidence 2 is glass shards broken beyond recognition, which suggests the light stand was shattered. So if the light stand was shattered into glass shards, how could White have seen it lying intact on the floor? Therefore, Testimony 1 (saw the light stand on the floor) contradicts Evidence 2 (shards), meaning the light stand was broken, not lying intact. So that's another possible pair: Evidence 2 and Testimony 1.

Hmm. So which one is correct?

The problem is that the receipt (Evidence 3) shows that the light stand was purchased, and the glass shards (Evidence 2) are the broken remains. So if the light stand was broken into shards, then White's Testimony 1 (seeing the light stand lying on the floor) is a lie because it was in pieces. Therefore, Evidence 2 (glass shards) contradicts Testimony 1 (light stand lying on floor). So that would be the pair: Evidence 2 and Testimony 1.

Alternatively, if the light stand was broken into shards, then Testimony 1's statement of seeing it lying on the floor is false. So that's a contradiction. That seems like a solid contradiction.

But wait, the receipt is for the purchase of the light stand, which is then broken. The glass shards are the remains. So if White claims he saw the light stand on the floor (intact?), but the evidence shows it's shattered into shards, that's a contradiction. Therefore, the evidence (shards) shows the light stand was broken, but White says he saw a light stand lying on the floor (intact?), which can't both be true. Hence, Evidence 2 and Testimony 1 contradict each other.

Alternatively, maybe the light stand was broken but lying on the floor as shards. But the testimony says "a light stand was lying on the floor," which implies it was intact. So if the evidence shows it's broken into shards, then the testimony is false. So that's the contradiction.

Therefore, the correct answer would be Evidence 2 (Glass Shards) and Testimony 1 (White's testimony about seeing the light stand lying on the floor).

{"evidence": 2, "testimony": 1}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants just one pair. Let's go through the testimonies and evidences step by step.

First, look at the testimonies. Testimony 3 is from White, where he says, "That is when I saw this glass light stand." The testimony is linked to White, and the context is when he entered the Fey & Co. offices to place the wiretap. 

Now, looking at the evidences related to the glass light stand. Evidence 2 is Glass Shards, described as broken remains of a glass light stand, broken beyond recognition. Evidence 3 is a Receipt for a glass light stand purchased the day before the murder. 

Wait, Testimony 3 says White saw the glass light stand when he placed the wiretap a week before the murder (since Testimony 0 mentions the week before the murder as the time). But the Receipt (Evidence 3) says the purchase date was the day before the murder. That's a contradiction. If the glass light stand was purchased the day before the murder, how could White have seen it a week earlier when he placed the wiretap? The light stand wouldn't have been there yet. So the existence of the receipt showing the purchase date contradicts White's testimony about seeing the stand a week prior. 

So the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (White seeing the stand during the wiretap placement a week before) and Evidence 3 (receipt showing it was bought the day before the murder, which would mean the stand wasn't there when White claims to have seen it). Therefore, the pair is Evidence 3 and Testimony 3.

{"evidence": 3, "testimony": 3}

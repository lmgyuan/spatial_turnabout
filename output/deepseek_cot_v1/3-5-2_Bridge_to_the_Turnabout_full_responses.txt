Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants me to find one pair where the evidence directly contradicts a testimony. Let's start by going through the testimonies and see which ones might have inconsistencies when compared to the evidence provided.

First, looking at the testimonies given by Bikini. Testimony 3 says: "Iris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner." So Bikini is stating that Iris was wearing the same clothes as during dinner when she came to the Inner Temple.

Now, looking at the evidence related to Iris. Evidence 6 is Iris's Hood, which mentions that Iris wears this hood at all times and that it was received before the lights-out bell the night of the crime. The hood is supposed to protect from evil spirits. But according to Bikini's Testimony 3, Iris was dressed the same as at dinner, implying she was wearing the hood then. However, if Iris gave her hood to someone else before the lights-out bell, which is at 10 PM according to Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony), then she wouldn't have been wearing it when she came to the Inner Temple. Wait, the timeline might be important here.

Wait, Evidence 6 says that the hood was received before the lights-out bell, which was at 10 PM. So if someone received the hood before 10 PM, then Iris wouldn't have it on after that time. But Bikini's Testimony 3 says that Iris came to the Inner Temple dressed exactly as at dinner. If dinner was before 10 PM, then Iris would still have the hood during dinner. But if she gave the hood to someone else before the lights-out bell (which is at 10 PM), then when she came to the Inner Temple after 10 PM, she wouldn't be wearing the hood. Therefore, Bikini's testimony that Iris was dressed the same as at dinner (including the hood) would contradict the evidence that the hood was received (i.e., taken from her) before the lights-out bell. So if Iris wasn't wearing the hood when she came to the Inner Temple, but Bikini says she was dressed the same as at dinner (which included the hood), that's a contradiction.

So the contradiction is between Bikini's Testimony 3 (which says Iris was dressed the same as at dinner, implying she still had the hood) and Evidence 6 (which states that the hood was received before the lights-out bell, meaning she wasn't wearing it after 10 PM). If Iris came to the Inner Temple after 10 PM, then according to Evidence 6, she shouldn't have the hood on. But Bikini claims she was dressed the same as during dinner, which would include the hood. Therefore, the testimony and evidence conflict here.

{"evidence": 6, "testimony": 3}
Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. I need to go through each testimony and see if any of the evidence directly contradicts what's being said.

First, looking at the testimonies. Testimony 3 by Bikini says that Iris didn't have her hood on when the incident happened. But there's Evidence 6, Iris's Hood, which mentions that Iris received the hood before the lights out bell and that it's supposed to protect from evil spirits. The testimony says she wasn't wearing it, but maybe the evidence suggests she should have been wearing it. Wait, no—the evidence just says she received it before the lights out bell, which was at 10 PM according to Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12). But Bikini's Testimony 3 is about seeing Iris without the hood during the crime. However, the hood itself isn't directly contradicting unless there's another piece of evidence. Let me check other evidence.

Testimony 2 by Bikini says she saw Iris with the sword. But Evidence 10, the Shichishito, is the supposed murder weapon with the victim's blood and the suspect's (probably Iris's) fingerprints. However, the evidence later states that it's not the actual murder weapon. Wait, that's conflicting. But how does that tie to the testimony? If the sword wasn't the murder weapon, but Bikini saw Iris with it, maybe that's a contradiction. But the evidence says it had the victim's blood and the suspect's fingerprints, but isn't the murder weapon. So perhaps the real weapon was something else. Let me check the autopsy.

Evidence 11, the autopsy report, says the cause was a stab in the back leading to blood loss, and the body fell 10 ft after death. The murder weapon was thought to be the Shichishito (Evidence 10), but according to Evidence 10, it's not the actual murder weapon. So maybe the real weapon is the dagger (Evidence 19) or the staff (Evidence 9) which has a hidden sword. Wait, the staff (Evidence 9) has a hidden sword. The Shichishito is a seven-branched sword, but the staff's sword might be the actual weapon. Also, the Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16) from the staff was found near the bridge with blood. So if the real murder weapon was the staff's hidden sword, then the Shichishito (Evidence 10) having the victim's blood and fingerprints would be a contradiction because it's not the actual murder weapon. But how does this contradict a testimony?

Looking at Testimony 2 again: Bikini says she saw Iris with the sword (Shichishito). But if that's not the murder weapon, then perhaps the actual stabbing happened with the staff's sword. So Bikini's testimony about seeing Iris with the Shichishito might be contradicted by the fact that the Shichishito wasn't the real weapon. But how do we know that the staff's sword was used? The autopsy says the victim was stabbed, and the staff's hidden sword could have been used. Also, the Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16) was part of the staff and found near the bridge. If the victim was stabbed with the staff's sword, then Bikini's testimony about Iris using the Shichishito would be incorrect. But the evidence (Shichishito) says it's not the murder weapon, so Testimony 2 (about Iris using it) would be contradicted by Evidence 10 stating it's not the real weapon. That seems like a contradiction.

Another angle: Testimony 5 by Bikini says the stabbing occurred after the victim was pushed out the window. But the autopsy (Evidence 11) states that the cause was the stab wound and that the body fell 10 ft after death. If the stabbing happened first, then the victim was pushed out after being stabbed. But Bikini's Testimony 5 says the stabbing was after being pushed out. That would be a contradiction. Let me check the autopsy again. The body fell 10 ft after death. So the fall happened post-mortem. If the stabbing caused death, then the fall was after. So if Bikini claims the stabbing was after the push (which would be a fall), that contradicts the autopsy which says the fall was after death (so the stabbing was before the fall). Therefore, Testimony 5 contradicts Evidence 11. So the testimony says the stabbing occurred after being pushed (fall), but the evidence says the fall was after death (so stabbing was before). That's a contradiction. So the pair would be Evidence 11 (autopsy report) and Testimony 5.

{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants one pair where the evidence doesn't match the testimony. Let me go through the testimonies and the evidences step by step.

First, let's look at Bikini's testimonies. Testimony 5 says: "And when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back!" So she claims she saw the stabbing happen. But according to the autopsy report (Evidence 11), the cause of death was a stab in the back, and the body fell 10 feet after death. If the body fell after death, that means the stabbing happened before the fall. However, if Bikini saw the stabbing happen, then how did the body fall 10 feet after? Wait, maybe that's not directly a contradiction. Let me check other evidence.

Looking at the Shichishito (Evidence 10), it's the apparent murder weapon with the victim's blood and suspect's fingerprints, but it's stated that it's not the actual murder weapon. The real weapon might be the staff's hidden sword (Evidence 9), which has a hidden sword inside. The staff's crystal sphere (Evidence 16) was found with blood, indicating it was used. So maybe the murder weapon was the staff's sword, not the Shichishito. But how does that relate to Bikini's testimony?

Wait, Testimony 5 says Bikini saw Mystic Ami stabbing Elise through the back. But the autopsy report says the stab was in the back, and the body fell 10 feet after death. If the stabbing caused death, then the body falling after that would require the body to have been moved or fallen from a height. The crime scene in the courtyard (Crime Photo, Evidence 13) might be where the body was found. But maybe the actual stabbing happened elsewhere. 

Also, the burnt letter (Evidence 18) is from Morgan Fey, which might indicate a plot involving Morgan, but not directly related here. 

Looking at Bikini's Testimony 5 again: she saw the stabbing. But if the body fell 10 feet after death, perhaps the stabbing didn't occur where the body was found. For example, if Elise was stabbed somewhere high and then fell. But Bikini claims to have witnessed the stabbing in the courtyard, but the autopsy suggests the body fell from a height after being stabbed. That might be a contradiction. Wait, but the courtyard where the murder happened (Crime Photo) – if the body fell 10 feet, maybe it was pushed off a bridge or something. Dusky Bridge is mentioned in the Weather Data (Evidence 7), which was struck by lightning. The tracks photo (Evidence 14) shows tracks leading to Dusky Bridge, and the crystal sphere was found near there. So maybe Elise was stabbed on the bridge, fell into the river, but the body was found in the courtyard? Hmm, not sure. 

Alternatively, Bikini's testimony about seeing the stabbing might conflict with the fact that the murder weapon was the staff's hidden sword, not the Shichishito. Since the Shichishito was found with the victim's blood but isn't the actual murder weapon, Bikini might have seen the Shichishito being used, but the real weapon was the staff. However, the testimony says she saw the stabbing with the sword, which contradicts the evidence that the Shichishito isn't the murder weapon. But how does that connect?

Wait, Testimony 5 says she saw Mystic Ami stabbing Elise through the back with the sword (Shichishito?), but Evidence 10 says the Shichishito isn't the murder weapon. So if Bikini testifies she saw the stabbing with that sword, but the evidence says that's not the actual weapon, that's a contradiction. However, in the evidence description for Shichishito (10), it says "Had the victim's blood and the suspect's fingerprints on it, but is not the murder weapon." So the real murder weapon is the staff's hidden sword (Evidence 9). Therefore, Bikini's testimony that she saw the stabbing with the Shichishito (which is not the actual weapon) would contradict the evidence. But in her testimony, she just says "stabbing Mystic Elise through the back," not specifying the weapon. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the contradiction is elsewhere. Let's check Testimony 5 again: Bikini says she saw the stabbing when she awoke. But according to Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12), she was in her room from 10 PM until the murder was discovered. If Iris was the one who did it, but Bikini saw Mystic Ami (maybe Iris?), but Iris has an alibi. Wait, Iris's hood (Evidence 6) was received before the crime. Maybe identity confusion? Also, Elise was wearing a hood in the photo (Evidence 5), and Iris's hood (Evidence 6) is magical. Maybe someone disguised as Elise?

Alternatively, the weather data (Evidence 7) says there was snow until 10:50 PM and lightning until 11 PM. The fire started and went out around 30 minutes. The bridge was struck at 10:45. If Bikini was in a position to see the stabbing, but the bridge was struck by lightning, maybe that's a timing issue. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: The crystal sphere (Evidence 16) from the staff was found near Dusky Bridge, which implies the staff was used there. The staff's hidden sword (Evidence 9) is the real murder weapon. So the stabbing might have occurred near the bridge, but Bikini's testimony places the stabbing in the courtyard? The crime photo (13) is the courtyard, but if the body fell 10 feet, maybe from the bridge. So if the murder happened on the bridge, but Bikini claims to have seen it in the courtyard, that's a contradiction. But the testimonies don't specify the location. 

Wait, Testimony 5 says "when I awoke... Mystic Ami was stabbing..." If Bikini fainted (Testimony 4) and then awoke to see the stabbing, the timing might conflict with other evidence. The autopsy report (11) says the time of death was 10-11 PM. The lightning struck at 10:45, which could be when the bridge caught fire. If the murder happened during the lightning strike, but Bikini's testimony about fainting and then seeing the stabbing upon awakening might not fit the timeline. However, the weather data says the snow stopped around 10:50, and lightning was until 11. The fire started after the lightning strike, taking 30 minutes to go out. So the murder must have happened around the same time as the lightning, perhaps. 

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 0: "When I looked across at the scene, the sword was already in place." If the sword (Shichishito) was already there, but the real murder weapon was the staff's sword, this could be a contradiction. But Bikini's testimonies 0-5 need to be cross-checked.

Wait, in Testimony 5, Bikini says she saw Mystic Ami stabbing Elise through the back. But if the autopsy report says the body fell 10 feet after death, that suggests that after being stabbed, the body fell. If Bikini saw the stabbing, then the body would have fallen after, which might not match the crime scene. For example, if the body was found in the courtyard but fell from a height, maybe the bridge, then Bikini couldn't have witnessed the stabbing there. Alternatively, the stabbing happened after the fall? That doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, the burnt letter (Evidence 18) from Morgan Fey might implicate someone else. But how does that tie in with Bikini's testimony?

Wait, the Magatama (Evidence 1) reacts to secrets. If Bikini's testimony has a Psyche-Lock, but that's in the game mechanics. The user's question is about contradiction between evidence and testimony.

Let me re-express the problem. Which piece of evidence directly contradicts a specific testimony?

Looking at Bikini's Testimony 5: She claims she saw Mystic Ami stabbing Elise through the back. However, the autopsy report (Evidence 11) states that the cause of death was a stab in the back, and the body fell 10 feet after death. If the body fell after death, that implies the stabbing occurred before the fall. If Bikini saw the stabbing, then the body should have been at the location where the stabbing occurred, not having fallen. But the body was found in the courtyard (Crime Photo 13), which may not be 10 feet high. So if the body fell 10 feet after death, the stabbing must have happened in a place higher than where the body was found. Therefore, Bikini could not have witnessed the stabbing at the location where the body was found if the body then fell 10 feet. Thus, her testimony contradicts the autopsy report's information about the body falling after death.

But the user wants the evidence number and testimony number. So Evidence 11 (autopsy report) contradicts Testimony 5.

Alternatively, the murder weapon. The Shichishito (Evidence 10) is stated to not be the murder weapon despite having the victim's blood and suspect's fingerprints. If Bikini's testimony says she saw the stabbing with the Shichishito (assuming that's the weapon she saw), but the evidence says it's not the murder weapon, that's a contradiction. However, Bikini's testimony doesn't specify the weapon used, just that a stabbing occurred. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, the real murder weapon is the staff's hidden sword (Evidence 9), which doesn't have the crystal sphere (Evidence 16). The crystal sphere was found near the bridge with blood. So the staff was used to stab, then the crystal sphere fell off. If the murder weapon was the staff's sword, then the Shichishito is a red herring. If Bikini testifies seeing the Shichishito used (if that's the case), but the evidence says it's not the weapon, that's a contradiction. But in her testimony, she doesn't mention the weapon. So maybe not.

Alternatively, Testimony 5 says Bikini saw the stabbing, but Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12) says she was in her room. If Iris is Mystic Ami, then Bikini's claim that Iris did it contradicts Iris's alibi. But the user is to pick one evidence and one testimony. The user asked for evidence and testimony, not two testimonies.

Wait, let's check the evidences again. The Note to Iris (Evidence 8) might be relevant, but not sure. The Larry's Sketch (15) might show something. Let's think: Bikini's testimony 5 says she saw the stabbing, but the autopsy says the body fell 10 feet after death. If the stabbing was in a location where the body could fall 10 feet, like a bridge, and Bikini was on the bridge, but the body was found elsewhere, that's a contradiction. Alternatively, Bikini's testimony of seeing the stabbing in the courtyard (Crime Photo 13) contradicts the fact that the body fell 10 feet after death, implying the stabbing happened elsewhere. Therefore, Bikini couldn't have witnessed the stabbing at the scene where the body was found because the body was moved after death. Therefore, her testimony contradicts the autopsy report (Evidence 11).

So the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (Bikini saw the stabbing) and Evidence 11 (body fell 10 feet after death). If she saw the stabbing, the body shouldn't have fallen afterward unless she saw it in a different location. But if the body was found in the courtyard and fell 10 feet, perhaps from the bridge, then Bikini's account of the stabbing's location is conflicting with the evidence of the body's movement post-death.

Alternatively, the stabbing happened on the bridge, the body fell into the river, but was found in the courtyard. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, the dagger (Evidence 19) has blood that doesn't match the victim. Not relevant here.

Wait, the crystal sphere (16) has blood and came from the staff. So the staff was used near Dusky Bridge. If Elise was stabbed there, her body fell 10 feet (perhaps into the river or onto rocks), but was then moved to the courtyard. The tracks photo (14) shows tracks leading to the bridge, so maybe the murderer moved the body. If Bikini claims to have seen the stabbing in the courtyard, but the body fell 10 feet elsewhere, that's a contradiction.

But Bikini's testimony doesn't specify location. The contradiction would be that if the body fell 10 feet after death, the stabbing must have occurred at a higher elevation, and Bikini couldn't have seen it in the courtyard unless the courtyard is elevated. But the map (Evidence 3) would show that.

Alternatively, maybe the staff's hidden sword (Evidence 9) is the real weapon, but Bikini's testimony refers to the Shichishito (Evidence 10), which isn't the actual weapon. If she testifies seeing the Shichishito being used to stab, but evidence says it's not the weapon, that's a contradiction. But she doesn't mention the weapon type. Hmm.

Wait, Testimony 2 says Bikini saw the blade being drawn out smoothly. Testimony 5 says she saw the stabbing. The Shichishito is a seven-branched sword, which would be jagged, making it hard to draw out smoothly. But the staff's hidden sword is a straight blade, which could be drawn smoothly. So Testimony 2 (smoothly drawn out) contradicts Shichishito's description (jagged), hence Evidence 10 contradicts Testimony 2. Because the Shichishito is jagged, but Bikini says the blade was drawn out smoothly. A jagged sword wouldn't come out smoothly. So Evidence 10 (Shichishito description) contradicts Testimony 2 (smoothly drawn).

But the user is to choose one pair. So in this case, Testimony 2 says the blade was smoothly drawn out, but the Shichishito (Evidence 10) is a seven-branched jagged sword, which would not allow for a smooth draw. Hence, this is a contradiction. So Evidence 10 and Testimony 2 contradict each other.

That seems like a solid contradiction. The testimony describes an action that's impossible with the evidence's description of the sword.

{"evidence": 10, "testimony": 2}
Okay, let's start by looking through the testimonies and evidences to find contradictions. The user wants one pair where the evidence and testimony don't match up.

First, let's check Bikini's testimonies. Testimony 0 says she saw the murder around 11 PM. The evidence includes the Weather Data (Evidence 7) which mentions that the lightning stopped around 11 PM, and the fire from the lightning on Dusky Bridge lasted about 30 minutes. If the murder happened at 11 PM, but the bridge was struck at 10:45 PM and the fire went out around 30 minutes later, that would be around 11:15 PM. Wait, maybe the timings here overlap. Hmm, not sure if that's the contradiction yet.

Looking at Testimony 3 from Bikini: It takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, but less than 5 using a snowmobile. Now, the Weather Data (Evidence 7) says that snow was falling until about 10:50 PM. If someone used a snowmobile after 10:50 PM, there might not be fresh snow to show tracks. But the Tracks Photo (Evidence 14) shows tracks leading from the Main Gate to Dusky Bridge. Wait, if the snow stopped at 10:50, any tracks made after that wouldn't be covered by new snow. So if the tracks were made after 10:50, they should still be visible. But Bikini's Testimony 2 says she saw tracks indicating the snowmobile was used. If the snowmobile was used after 10:50 PM, the tracks would be preserved. But maybe the timing is conflicting. For example, if the murder happened at 11 PM, and the snowmobile was used after that, the tracks would be there. But perhaps there's an issue with the timeline here.

Alternatively, consider Testimony 4 where Bikini suggests the killer could have thrown the weapon into the river and come back while she was knocked out. But the Shichishito (Evidence 10) is the apparent murder weapon with the victim's blood and suspect's prints, but it's stated that it's not the actual murder weapon. The real weapon might be the staff's hidden sword (Evidence 9), but that's a different point.

Wait, let's think again. Bikini's Testimony 3 says that using a snowmobile takes less than 5 minutes to Dusky Bridge. However, if the bridge was struck by lightning at 10:45 PM, which started a fire that lasted 30 minutes (until around 11:15 PM), then the bridge might have been on fire during that time. If someone used the snowmobile to go to the bridge after 10:45 PM, wouldn't the bridge be on fire, making it impossible to cross? So if the tracks in the photo (Evidence 14) show tracks leading to the bridge, but the bridge was burning, that could be a contradiction. However, the bridge was struck at 10:45, so maybe the fire started then. The fire went out after 30 minutes, around 11:15. So between 10:45 and 11:15, the bridge was on fire. If someone used the snowmobile after 10:45 PM to go to the bridge, they couldn't cross it because of the fire. But Bikini's testimony 3 is about the time it takes, not the possibility due to the fire. Hmm, maybe not directly related.

Another angle: Bikini's Testimony 5 says Iris could have done it because she can drive a snowmobile. But Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12) says she was in her room from 10 PM until the murder was discovered. If the tracks were made by a snowmobile after 10 PM, and Iris was in her room, that contradicts. But the Tracks Photo (Evidence 14) shows tracks leading to the bridge. If Iris was in her room, she couldn't have made the tracks. But Bikini's testimony 5 is suggesting Iris could have done it, but Iris's alibi might contradict that. However, the question is about evidence contradicting testimony, not another testimony.

Wait, the user asked for evidence and testimony that contradict each other. Let's check the Weather Data (7) and Bikini's Testimony 0. The weather data says snow stopped around 10:50 PM, lightning until 11 PM. The murder time in the autopsy (Evidence 11) is between 10-11 PM. Bikini says she saw the murder around 11 PM. If the snow stopped at 10:50, then any tracks made after 10:50 wouldn't be covered by new snow. The Tracks Photo (14) shows tracks leading to the bridge. If the snowmobile was used after 10:50, the tracks would be visible. Bikini's Testimony 2 says she saw tracks from the snowmobile. That seems consistent. Hmm.

Wait, Testimony 3: Bikini says using a snowmobile takes less than 5 minutes. The distance from the Main Gate to Dusky Bridge via snowmobile is 5 minutes. But if the bridge was on fire from 10:45 to 11:15, then anyone going there during that time couldn't cross. But the murder happened at 10-11 PM. If the killer used the snowmobile to go to the bridge after 10:45, they couldn't cross. But the victim's body fell 10 ft after death (Autopsy 11), perhaps implying the bridge collapse. So maybe the murder was on the bridge when it was struck by lightning. If the murder happened at 10:45 PM, then Bikini's testimony of seeing it at 11 PM is contradictory. The autopsy says time of death between 10-11 PM, but Bikini's Testimony 0 claims she saw the murder around 11 PM. However, the lightning struck at 10:45 PM, which might have caused the bridge to collapse. If the murder happened at 10:45, then Bikini's testimony of 11 PM is conflicting. But the time window is 10-11 PM, so 10:45 is within that. Hmm.

Alternatively, the Crystal Sphere (16) was found near Dusky Bridge, which came from the staff. The staff's crystal sphere is missing in Evidence 9. The sphere has blood, so maybe it was part of the murder. If the bridge was struck by lightning at 10:45 PM, causing the fire, then the sphere might have been there at that time. But how does that relate to testimonies?

Wait, let's focus on Bikini's Testimony 3: "It takes 15 minutes to walk to Dusky Bridge, but less than 5 using one of those (snowmobile)." The Weather Data (7) says that snow was falling until 10:50 PM, and lightning until 11 PM. If someone used the snowmobile after 10:50 PM, the snow had stopped, so the tracks wouldn't be covered. But the Tracks Photo (14) shows tracks leading to the bridge. If the snowmobile was used during the snowfall (before 10:50), the tracks would be covered by snow. However, the tracks are visible in the photo, meaning they were made after the snow stopped. So the snowmobile was used after 10:50 PM. But Bikini's Testimony 3 says it takes less than 5 minutes by snowmobile. If the trip takes 5 minutes, then someone could go to the bridge after 10:50 PM. But the bridge was struck by lightning at 10:45 PM and was on fire until 11:15 PM. So if the snowmobile tracks were made after 10:50 PM, the bridge was on fire. Therefore, going to the bridge via snowmobile after 10:50 would mean the person couldn't cross it. But the tracks in the photo (14) go to the bridge. So the contradiction is that the tracks would have been made after the snow stopped (after 10:50 PM), but the bridge was on fire, so the snowmobile couldn't reach the bridge. Therefore, the existence of tracks leading to the bridge (Evidence 14) contradicts Bikini's Testimony 3 about the time it takes, because the bridge was impassable due to fire after 10:45 PM. So Bikini says you can get there in 5 minutes via snowmobile, but if the bridge was on fire, you couldn't actually cross it, making the tracks impossible unless made before 10:45. But the tracks would be covered by snow if made before 10:50. Therefore, the presence of tracks (Evidence 14) contradicts Bikini's Testimony 3, as the tracks would have to be made after the snow stopped (after 10:50 PM), but the bridge was on fire then, making the journey impossible. Therefore, the tracks shouldn't exist if Bikini's testimony is accurate. Thus, Evidence 14 (Tracks Photo) contradicts Testimony 3 (Bikini's claim about the time to get there via snowmobile) because the bridge was on fire when the tracks were made.

{"evidence": 14, "testimony": 3}
Okay, let's tackle this. So, I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants one pair. Let me go through the provided information step by step.

First, looking at the characters, evidences, and testimonies. The testimonies are from Larry Butz (Testimony 0-6). Let's check each testimony against the evidence.

Testimony 0: Larry says he went to the shack around 9, so it would have been about 10:30 PM. Wait, but if he went at 9, why does he mention 10:30? Maybe a time discrepancy. Let me check the evidence.

Evidence 7 is the Weather Data. It states that snow was from 7 to approx 10:50 PM, and lightning from 10 to 11 PM. Also, lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM. The fire started and went out around 30 minutes later. Hmm. If Larry says he went to the shack around 9 PM, but then in Testimony 5 he says he arrived at the bridge and Nick showed up less than a minute later. Wait, Testimony 5: "I arrived at the bridge, and Nick showed up less than a minute later." But according to the weather data, the lightning struck at 10:45 PM. So when did Larry go to the bridge?

Wait, Testimony 0: He went to the shack at around 9, so it would have been about 10:30 PM. That's confusing. Maybe he's saying that he went to the shack at 9 PM, but the time he's referring to (the event) was at 10:30 PM? Or perhaps there's a contradiction in timing here. Let me cross-reference with other evidence.

Evidence 16 is the Crystal Sphere, found near Dusky Bridge with blood, came from the victim's staff. The staff (Evidence 9) had a hidden sword, and the Shichishito (Evidence 10) was the apparent murder weapon but not the actual one. The autopsy report (Evidence 11) says the victim died between 10-11 PM. 

Now, looking at Testimony 5: Larry says he arrived at the bridge and Nick (Phoenix) showed up less than a minute later. But Phoenix fell from the bridge and is hospitalized. The bridge was struck by lightning at 10:45 PM, causing a fire. According to Evidence 7, the fire started around 10:45 and went out after 30 minutes. So if Larry arrived at the bridge when it was on fire (Testimony 2 says he saw the bridge on fire after a white flash at his window), that would be around 10:45. But if he claims he arrived at the bridge and then Phoenix showed up, but Phoenix was there before the lightning strike? Or after?

Wait, Phoenix fell from the bridge and is hospitalized. So the timeline might be: the lightning strike caused the bridge to catch fire, and Phoenix fell. But according to Testimony 5, Larry says he arrived at the bridge and Nick showed up less than a minute later. But if the bridge was already on fire at 10:45, then Larry's arrival would be around that time. However, Phoenix's fall would have to be around the same time. But according to Evidence 7, the fire started at 10:45 and lasted 30 minutes. So if Larry arrived at the bridge after seeing it on fire, he would have gone there around 10:45. But Testimony 5 says he arrived and then Nick showed up. But Phoenix was already there and fell. So maybe there's a contradiction here.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 3: "There was still some thunder, but I went right away to check it out." The thunder was from 10-11 PM. If Larry went to check the bridge right after seeing the fire (Testimony 2), which was caused by lightning at 10:45. So he would have gone there around 10:45. Then, Testimony 5 says he arrived at the bridge and Nick showed up less than a minute later. But Phoenix was on the bridge before the lightning struck. So perhaps Larry's testimony about the timing is conflicting with the weather data.

Wait, let's check Testimony 0 again: He says he went to the shack around 9 PM, so it would have been about 10:30 PM. Wait, maybe there's a miscalculation here. If he went to the shack at 9 PM, how does that relate to the time of 10:30? That might be a mistake. Or maybe he's saying that the time when he went to the shack was around 9 PM, but the events he's describing happened at 10:30 PM. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, Testimony 5: Larry says he arrived at the bridge and Nick showed up less than a minute later. But according to the weather data, the lightning struck at 10:45 PM. If the bridge caught fire then, and Phoenix fell, then Larry couldn't have arrived at the bridge before the lightning strike. So if Larry arrived at the bridge after the lightning strike (10:45), then Nick (Phoenix) would have already fallen. So Testimony 5 contradicts the timeline from the weather data. Therefore, Evidence 7 (Weather Data) contradicts Testimony 5 (Larry's statement that Nick arrived a minute after he did), because according to the weather data, the lightning strike (which caused the fire) was at 10:45, and Phoenix would have been there before that. Or perhaps Larry's claim about arriving and Nick showing up later doesn't fit with the time of the lightning strike and fire.

Wait, but Phoenix was hospitalized after falling from the bridge. So when did he fall? The lightning struck the bridge at 10:45, which likely caused the fire. Phoenix was on the bridge and fell, leading to his hospitalization. So if Larry arrived at the bridge after the fire started (at 10:45), and Phoenix was already there and fell, then Larry's testimony that Nick arrived a minute after he did is impossible. Because Phoenix would have already fallen. So this contradiction would be between Testimony 5 (Larry's statement) and the Weather Data (Evidence 7) which states the lightning strike time. Therefore, the correct pair is Evidence 7 and Testimony 5.

Alternatively, another angle: Testimony 2 says Larry looked out the window and saw the bridge on fire. Testimony 3 says he went to check it out despite some thunder. Testimony 5 says he arrived at the bridge and Nick showed up less than a minute later. But according to Evidence 7, the lightning struck at 10:45, causing the fire. The snow stopped around 10:50. The fire lasted 30 minutes. So Larry's arrival at the bridge would be around 10:45. If Nick (Phoenix) was already on the bridge when the lightning struck, then Larry couldn't have seen him arrive after Larry himself got there. That's a contradiction.

Thus, the evidence that shows the lightning strike time (Evidence 7) contradicts Testimony 5 where Larry claims Nick arrived at the bridge after he did. Therefore, the answer should be {"evidence": 7, "testimony":5}.

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants one pair. Let's start by going through the testimonies and checking each one against the evidence provided.

First, looking at the testimonies. Testimonies 0 to 4 are all from Butz (Larry). Let's check each of his statements.

Testimony 2: "I saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering!" The evidence related to Iris's Hood is Evidence 6, which mentions she received the hood before the lights out bell and it's supposed to protect from evil spirits. But wait, the weather data in Evidence 7 says there was snow from 7 PM to 10:50 PM and lightning until 11 PM. The lights out bell was at 10 PM according to Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12). So Iris was in her room from 10 PM onwards. If Larry saw Iris flying after 10 PM, that contradicts because Iris should have been in her room. But wait, Larry's sketch (Evidence 15) and his testimony about the time when he saw her? Let me check.

The Crime Photo (Evidence 13) and the Tracks Photo (Evidence 14) might not directly relate. The key point here is Larry's statement about seeing Iris flying. However, according to Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12), she rang the bell at 10 PM and stayed in her room. So Larry couldn't have seen her outside after 10 PM unless she left, which would contradict her testimony. But wait, the timing of when Larry saw her is important. Let me check the timing of the events.

The murder happened between 10 and 11 PM (Autopsy Report, Evidence 11). The snow stopped around 10:50 PM, and there was lightning until 11 PM. The fire started and went out around 30 minutes (from Evidence 7). Let's piece this together. Larry's testimony 2 says he saw Iris flying. But according to Iris's testimony, she was in her room. So this could be a contradiction, but the evidence to counter that would be her testimony (Evidence 12). However, the user asked for evidence and testimony contradictions, not between two testimonies. So maybe another angle.

Looking at Testimony 3: "The shock and awe that I was feeling... I transferred it all directly onto the page!" This refers to Larry's sketch (Evidence 15). The sketch is described as a horrible sketch of what he saw. Now, if Larry was sketching in front of the bridge (Testimony 1), but the weather data (Evidence 7) shows that there was snow until 10:50 PM and lightning. If he was sketching during that time, how could he be outside sketching in such weather? Wait, but the snow stopped around 10:50, and the lightning was until 11 PM. The murder was at 10-11 PM. So if Larry was sketching in front of the bridge during the snow, maybe his sketch would show tracks covered by snow. But the Tracks Photo (Evidence 14) shows one track leading from the Main Gate to Dusky Bridge. If Larry was there sketching during the snow, maybe his presence would leave tracks, but the tracks photo only shows one set. However, this might not be a direct contradiction.

Alternatively, let's look at Testimony 4: "...Before I realized it, the flames had gone out and then he came running up." The flames refer to the fire from the lightning strike on Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM (Evidence 7). The fire lasted about 30 minutes, so it would have gone out around 11:15 PM. But the autopsy report (Evidence 11) states the time of death was between 10-11 PM, which would be before the fire went out. So if the body fell 10 ft after death, perhaps the fire was involved. But how does this relate to Larry's testimony?

Wait, the Shichishito (Evidence 10) is the apparent murder weapon but isn't the actual one. The real weapon might be the dagger (Evidence 19) or the staff's hidden sword (Evidence 9). The staff's crystal sphere (Evidence 16) was found near Dusky Bridge with blood. If the victim was stabbed with the Shichishito, but the autopsy says cause was a stab in the back leading to blood loss. The Shichishito had the victim's blood but isn't the murder weapon. So the contradiction here could be between Larry's testimony and the evidence about the murder weapon. But that's not directly linked.

Alternatively, Testimony 2: Larry saw Iris flying with her white hood. But Iris's Hood (Evidence 6) says she received it before the lights out bell, which was at 10 PM, and she was in her room. If Larry saw her after 10 PM, that contradicts her testimony. However, the evidence here would be Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12), but the question asks for an evidence-testimony pair. So maybe the evidence that contradicts Larry's Testimony 2 is Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony). But the user might be looking for evidence and testimony from the same person.

Wait, but the user's instruction is to pick one pair where evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let's look for a testimony from Larry that contradicts an evidence item. For example, Larry says he was sketching in front of the bridge (Testimony 1), but the Tracks Photo (Evidence 14) shows only one track leading to Dusky Bridge. If Larry was there, wouldn't there be tracks? But the photo shows one track. If Larry was there, maybe his tracks would be there, but the photo only shows one, implying only one person went there, contradicting his presence. So if he was sketching there, his tracks should be present, but the photo shows only one set. That's a possible contradiction.

But Evidence 14 is the Tracks Photo, which shows one track leading from Main Gate to Dusky Bridge. If Larry was at the bridge sketching, his tracks should be there. But the photo shows only one track. So if Larry was there, that would mean two tracks (his and someone else's), but the photo shows only one. That would contradict his testimony that he was there. Therefore, Testimony 1 (sketching in front of the bridge) contradicts Evidence 14 (only one track). But wait, the track could have been covered by snow. The snow was until 10:50 PM. If Larry was there during the snow, his tracks might have been covered. But the time when the track was made matters. Let me check the weather data again. Snow stopped at 10:50 PM, lightning until 11 PM. If the track was made after the snow stopped, then it wouldn't be covered. So if Larry was there sketching after 10:50, his tracks would be visible. But the tracks photo shows only one track. If the track was made before the snow stopped, the snow would cover it. Hmm. This might be a possible contradiction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, Testimony 2 where Larry says he saw Iris flying. Iris's Hood (Evidence 6) says she received it before the lights out bell and was in her room. But if she was in her room, how could Larry see her flying? That would mean her testimony (Evidence 12) contradicts Larry's Testimony 2. But the user wants an evidence and testimony pair. So Evidence 12 (Iris's Testimony) contradicts Testimony 2 (Larry's). But the problem is that the user specified to pick an evidence and testimony that contradict each other, not two testimonies. So maybe another angle.

Looking at Testimony 4: "...the flames had gone out and then he came running up." The flames from the bridge fire. According to Evidence 7, the fire started at 10:45 PM (lightning strike) and took around 30 minutes to go out, so it would be around 11:15 PM. But the autopsy report (Evidence 11) states time of death between 10-11 PM. So if the victim died before 11 PM, but the fire went out at 11:15, there's a discrepancy. But how does this relate to Larry's testimony? Maybe the timing here. If the flames went out after 11 PM, but the murder happened before 11 PM, maybe Larry's testimony about the flames going out before someone came is conflicting with the timing. However, this might not directly involve a contradiction between a specific evidence and testimony.

Wait, Evidence 16: Crystal Sphere found near Dusky Bridge with blood. The staff (Evidence 9) originally had the crystal sphere, but it was missing. The sphere has blood, implying it was part of the murder. If the victim was stabbed with the sphere, but the autopsy says a stab wound from a sword. The Shichishito (Evidence 10) was not the murder weapon. The staff's hidden sword (Evidence 9) might be the actual weapon. But the sphere could have been used to hit the victim. Hmm, perhaps not directly relevant.

Another angle: Testimony 2 (Larry saw Iris flying) versus the fact that Iris's Hood (Evidence 6) was received before 10 PM. If Iris was in her room, Larry couldn't have seen her. But the evidence here would be Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12), which is a testimony, not physical evidence. The user might be looking for physical evidence contradicting testimony. Alternatively, the Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16) has blood, which came from the staff. If the victim was holding the staff when attacked, the sphere might have fallen off during the struggle. But how does that relate to testimony?

Alternatively, Larry's Sketch (Evidence 15) is a horrible sketch. If his Testimony 3 says he transferred his shock onto the page, but the sketch might not match reality. For example, if the sketch shows something that contradicts another evidence. But without seeing the sketch details, it's hard to tell. The user mentions "Click here for details" but we don't have those. Maybe the sketch shows Iris flying, which contradicts her being in her room. But that would again relate to Testimony 2 and Evidence 12.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 2 (Larry saw Iris flying) and the Photo of Elise (Evidence 5). The photo shows Elise in a white robe and hood, holding a staff with a crystal sphere. If Larry saw someone in a white hood, he might have mistaken Elise for Iris. Especially since Elise's photo has a similar description to Iris's appearance. So Larry's Testimony 2 claims he saw Iris, but it might have been Elise (the victim) instead. However, Elise was the victim, so she would have been dead by then. Wait, the timeline: Elise was murdered between 10-11 PM. If Larry saw her before her death, but according to the timeline, the snow stopped at 10:50, lightning until 11. If the murder happened around 10:45 (when the bridge was struck), maybe Elise was already dead. Alternatively, if Elise was channeling Misty Fey (as per the Hanging Scroll, Evidence 4), which is covered in gravy, perhaps indicating someone else was channeling her. But this might be too convoluted.

Alternatively, the Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16) was found near Dusky Bridge, which came from the victim's staff (Evidence 9). If the staff was used in the murder, the sphere fell off there. But Larry's Testimony 2 says he saw Iris flying there, which would mean Iris was at the bridge. But Iris's Testimony (Evidence 12) says she was in her room. So the presence of the crystal sphere (Evidence 16) near the bridge, which is part of the staff (Elise's), suggests that the victim was there. If Larry saw Iris, but the victim was Elise (in a similar white robe), he might have mistaken her for Iris. But this is more of a deduction rather than a direct contradiction between evidence and testimony.

Wait, the key contradiction might be between Larry's Testimony 2 (saw Iris flying) and the fact that Iris's Hood (Evidence 6) was in her possession, and she was in her room. But Evidence 6 is a physical item (the hood) that Iris had, but Larry claims to have seen her wearing it outside. However, unless the hood was found elsewhere, this isn't a direct contradiction. Maybe Iris's Hood (Evidence 6) being in her possession proves she wasn't there, but Larry's testimony says otherwise. But how does the hood's evidence directly contradict? The hood was received before 10 PM, and she was in her room. So the hood would be with her, but Larry's testimony says he saw her wearing it outside. So if the hood was with her in her room, Larry couldn't have seen her wearing it outside. But the evidence is that she had the hood, not necessarily that it wasn't elsewhere. Hmm.

Alternatively, the Weather Data (Evidence 7) says there was lightning until 11 PM. If Larry was outside sketching during the lightning, that's dangerous, but not impossible. However, Testimony 1 says he was sketching in front of the bridge. The Tracks Photo (Evidence 14) shows tracks leading to the bridge. If Larry was there, his tracks should be present. But the photo only shows one track. If Larry was there, there should be two tracks (his and the victim's or someone else's). But the photo only shows one, implying only one person went there, contradicting his presence. Therefore, Testimony 1 (sketching at the bridge) contradicts Evidence 14 (only one track). That's a solid contradiction. Let's confirm: Testimony 1: Larry was sketching in front of the bridge. Evidence 14: Tracks Photo shows one track leading to the bridge. If Larry was there, his tracks would be part of that, but the photo shows only one set. Therefore, if he was there, there should be tracks, but the evidence says only one. Hence, contradiction. Therefore, the pair is Evidence 14 and Testimony 1.

Wait, but Larry's Testimony 1 says he was sketching in front of the bridge. If he was there, then there should be tracks leading there, but the photo shows only one set. So if the photo was taken that night, and the tracks are from the Main Gate to the bridge, then Larry's tracks would be part of that. Unless he went there after the snow stopped. The snow stopped at 10:50 PM. If Larry was sketching after that, his tracks wouldn't be covered by snow. But the Tracks Photo (Evidence 14) shows only one track. So if Larry was there sketching, his track should be present. Therefore, the Tracks Photo (Evidence 14) contradicts Testimony 1, as the photo shows only one track, implying only one person went to the bridge, but Larry claims to have been there, so there should be his tracks as well. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 1 (Larry's statement of being at the bridge) and Evidence 14 (only one track exists). Hence, the answer should be {"evidence": 14, "testimony": 1}.

{"evidence": 14, "testimony": 1}

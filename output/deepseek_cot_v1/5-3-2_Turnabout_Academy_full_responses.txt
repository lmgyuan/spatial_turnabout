Okay, let's see. The user wants me to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. So I need to look through the testimonies and the evidence to find inconsistencies.

First, let's look at the testimonies provided by Myriam Scuttlebutt (Testimony 0 to 4). Testimony 4 says she's positive it was Juniper because she was wearing the costume she made, and there's a photo showing the back of a figure in a plain blue costume. But wait, looking at Evidence 4, the Stage Costume is described as having a glowing star pattern. The photo in Testimony 4 shows a plain blue costume, but the actual costume (Evidence 4) is supposed to glow and have stars. So there's a contradiction here. The testimony claims the person was wearing Juniper's costume, but the photo doesn't match the described costume. Therefore, Evidence 4 (Stage Costume) contradicts Testimony 4.

{"evidence": 4, "testimony": 4}

Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. The testimonies are all from Hugh O'Conner (Character 6). Let me go through each testimony and check against the evidence.

Testimony 3 says Hugh never went to the art room. But looking at the evidence, Evidence 2 is Courte's Planner, which mentions a meeting with Hugh on the 23rd. If Courte had a meeting with Hugh on that day, maybe that meeting was in the art room? But the planner doesn't specify the location. Wait, Evidence 9 is the Tape Recorder, which mentions a conversation recorded in the art room at 7:10 PM. The testimony from Hugh (Testimony 0) says he was at the archery range until 7:00 PM. Then Testimony 1 says he went to the main building at 7:15 and saw Juniper. However, the tape in the art room was recorded at 7:10 PM. If Hugh was at the archery range until 7, then went to the main building by 7:15, maybe he passed by the art room. But Testimony 3 says he never went there. The voice on the tape is a woman shouting "You're a goner!" which matches Junie's script, but the tape is a fake. The analysis (Evidence 19) says it's fake, created by Prof. Means using Hugh to pass it to police. Wait, Evidence 9 says Prof. Means used Hugh to pass the fake tape. So Hugh was involved in delivering the fake evidence. But Hugh's testimony says he didn't go to the art room. If the tape was recorded in the art room at 7:10 PM, and Hugh was the one who gave it to the police, maybe he was there. So his testimony 3 ("I never went to the art room") contradicts Evidence 9, which implies he was involved in delivering the tape from the art room. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 9. But wait, the actual location of the recording is the art room. If Hugh provided the tape, but he says he never went there, that's a contradiction. So the evidence would be 9 and testimony 3. Let me check again. Evidence 9 states the tape was recorded in the art room, and Hugh was used by Means to pass it to police. But Hugh claims he wasn't in the art room. Therefore, if he delivered the tape, he must have been there or obtained it from there, contradicting his testimony. So the answer should be evidence 9 and testimony 3.

{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 3}

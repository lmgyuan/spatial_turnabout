Okay, let's tackle this. So the task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies, and I need to pick one pair where the evidence contradicts a testimony.

First, I'll go through the testimonies. The testimonies from Sorin (Testimony 0 to 5) include statements like "The truth is, I went to the vista deck with Pierce" (Testimony 0), "I was badly injured from being stabbed" (Testimony 3), and "The knife wound is quite deep" (Testimony 4). 

Looking at the evidence, especially the ones related to the stabbing. Evidence 17 is the Candelabra with Gloomsbury's left-hand fingerprints and blood matching the lift. Evidence 14 (Autopsy Report) says the victim was hit twice on the head with the Time Keeper. Wait, but Sorin's testimonies mention being stabbed with a candelabra. But the autopsy report says the victim (Gloomsbury) was killed by the Time Keeper hitting his head. So if Sorin is claiming he was stabbed by Gloomsbury, but the actual murder weapon (Time Keeper) was used on Gloomsbury, that's a contradiction.

Wait, Sorin is the one who was stabbed according to his testimony. The victim is Gloomsbury. So Sorin says he was stabbed by Gloomsbury during a struggle. But the Autopsy Report (Evidence 14) says Gloomsbury was killed by two hits to the head with the Time Keeper. So if Sorin was stabbed, that's his injury, but the murder weapon for Gloomsbury's death is different. But how does that contradict?

Wait, maybe the candelabra is involved. Evidence 17 says the candelabra has Gloomsbury's fingerprints and blood matching the lift. Sorin's testimony (Testimony 3 and 4) says he was stabbed, implying the candelabra was used on him. But the murder weapon for Gloomsbury is the Time Keeper. So Sorin's injury is from the candelabra, which Gloomsbury used, but then who killed Gloomsbury? The Time Keeper was used on him. So maybe Sorin's story about being stabbed by Gloomsbury with the candelabra is true, but then how did Gloomsbury end up killed with the Time Keeper? That could mean Sorin's testimony about the stabbing is true, but there's another contradiction.

Wait, looking at Testimony 0: Sorin says he went to the vista deck with Pierce. But Ellen's Statement (Evidence 2) mentions she saw a suspicious third party on the vista deck when she was attacked. If Sorin was there with Pierce, maybe that third party is someone else, which contradicts? Or perhaps the timing is off.

Alternatively, the Autopsy Report (Evidence 14) states the victim was killed by the Time Keeper, but Sorin's testimony (Testimony 3 and 4) talks about being stabbed. But Sorin's injury is separate from Gloomsbury's death. Hmm. Maybe the contradiction is in the timeline or the murder weapon.

Wait, looking at the Nichody testimonies attached to each evidence. For example, Evidence 0's Nichody testimony says that Sorin was stabbed by Gloomsbury with the candelabra. But the Autopsy Report (14) says Gloomsbury was killed by the Time Keeper. So if Gloomsbury was alive to stab Sorin, but then Gloomsbury was killed by the Time Keeper, that's possible. But maybe Sorin's testimony about being stabbed contradicts the actual murder weapon used on Gloomsbury? Not directly. Wait, perhaps the key is that the candelabra was used by Gloomsbury to stab Sorin, but the Time Keeper was used to kill Gloomsbury. But how does that contradict Sorin's testimony?

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 5 from Sorin: "By the time we reached the scene, it was all over." If Sorin and Pierce arrived after the murder, but perhaps evidence shows they were involved earlier. For example, the blood on the lift (Evidence 16) matching the candelabra (Evidence 17) suggests that Sorin's stabbing happened there, but maybe the timeline doesn't add up.

Wait, perhaps the key contradiction is in the Autopsy Report (14) stating that Gloomsbury was killed by two hits to the head with the Time Keeper. But Sorin's testimony (Testimony 3 and 4) claims he was stabbed by Gloomsbury. If Gloomsbury was killed by someone else using the Time Keeper, then Sorin's account of the struggle leading to his stabbing might not explain Gloomsbury's death. But that's more of a gap than a direct contradiction.

Alternatively, let's look at the Business Card Wallet (Evidence 9) with an imprint. But not sure. Or the Fog Machine (8) and Photo of Reception (10) showing fog. Maybe Sorin's testimony about events during the fog contradicts the photo.

Wait, Ellen's Statement (Evidence 2) says she saw a suspicious third party on the vista deck when attacked. If Sorin and Pierce were there (Testimony 0), that third party might be someone else, but that's not a direct contradiction. Unless Sorin's presence with Pierce contradicts Ellen seeing another person.

Hmm. Another angle: the Candelabra (Evidence 17) has Gloomsbury's left-hand fingerprints. Gloomsbury's Note (7) is written as if by a right-handed person. That's a contradiction for Gloomsbury's handedness. But which testimony contradicts that? The note's smudge suggests right-handed, but the candelabra has left-hand prints. So Gloomsbury is left-handed, but the note was written by a right-handed person. That implies the note was forged. But how does that contradict a testimony? None of the testimonies mention Gloomsbury's handedness. Unless Sorin's testimony about the struggle implies Gloomsbury used his left hand, but the note is right-handed. But the testimonies given by Sorin don't mention that. So maybe this isn't the contradiction.

Wait, looking at Testimony 0: Sorin says he went to the vista deck with Pierce. But Evidence 13 (Photo of Hold) shows Ellen in the hold, perhaps at a time when Sorin should have been elsewhere. But timing isn't clear.

Alternatively, the Hold Entry Record (15) might show who accessed the hold. If Sorin's testimony says he was with Pierce on the vista deck, but his key card was used to access the hold, that could be a contradiction. But the evidence isn't specified here.

Alternatively, the Broken Lantern (5) has a bloodstain on the inside wheel handle, as if someone gripped it with a bloody hand. If Sorin was injured and bleeding, his blood would be there. But if the blood on the lantern is from the victim (Gloomsbury), maybe that's a contradiction. But not directly linked to a testimony.

Wait, going back to the initial problem. The user wants one pair where evidence and testimony contradict. Let's think again.

Sorin's Testimony 3: "I was badly injured from being stabbed, but I was frantic." He claims he was stabbed by Gloomsbury with the candelabra (as per Nichody's statement on Evidence 0, 1, etc.). The Autopsy Report (14) says Gloomsbury was killed by the Time Keeper. So Sorin's injury is from the candelabra, but the murder weapon for Gloomsbury is different. That doesn't directly contradict, but perhaps the fact that the Time Keeper was used on Gloomsbury suggests that Sorin couldn't have been stabbed by Gloomsbury if Gloomsbury was already dead. Wait, but the timeline: Gloomsbury attacks Sorin, stabs him, then later someone kills Gloomsbury with the Time Keeper. That's possible, but maybe the Autopsy Report's details contradict Sorin's account.

Wait, the Autopsy Report says Gloomsbury's head was hit twice. So the cause of death is blunt force trauma, not a stabbing. So if Sorin says Gloomsbury stabbed him, but Gloomsbury was killed by being hit on the head, then there's no contradiction. Unless Sorin's testimony implies that Gloomsbury was alive after the stabbing, but the Time Keeper was used to kill him. But maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.

Looking at Evidence 17 (Candelabra) which has blood matching the lift (Evidence 16). If Sorin was stabbed there, then his blood would be on the candelabra. But the candelabra has Gloomsbury's fingerprints. So if Gloomsbury used it to stab Sorin, that makes sense. But Sorin's blood would be on it. However, the evidence description says the candelabra has traces of blood matching the lift, which is the same as the lift bloodstain. If Sorin's blood is on the candelabra, but the lift's bloodstain matches the candelabra, then perhaps the blood is Sorin's. But the Autopsy Report says Gloomsbury's cause of death is head trauma. So perhaps Sorin's injury is separate. No direct contradiction here.

Wait, Testimony 4: Sorin says, "The knife wound is quite deep..." But the murder weapon for Gloomsbury was the Time Keeper (a clock), and the candelabra was used to stab Sorin. So if Sorin refers to a knife wound, but the weapon was a candelabra, that's a contradiction. Because a candelabra isn't a knife. Wait, in Evidence 17, the candelabra is the weapon used to stab Sorin, but Sorin refers to it as a knife wound. That's a contradiction. Because a candelabra would cause a puncture or stab wound, but not a knife wound. So if Sorin describes it as a knife wound, but the actual weapon was a candelabra, that's a discrepancy.

But looking at the evidence: Evidence 17's description mentions the candelabra has bloodstains, and it's the weapon used in the struggle. Sorin's testimony (Testimony 4) says "knife wound," but the weapon was a candelabra. So that's a contradiction. Because a candelabra isn't a knife. Therefore, the testimony refers to a knife wound, but the evidence shows the weapon was a candelabra. Hence, contradiction between Testimony 4 (knife wound) and Evidence 17 (candelabra with blood).

But the user instructions say to pick one evidence and testimony. So if Testimony 4 mentions a knife wound, but the actual weapon was a candelabra (Evidence 17), that's the contradiction. Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 17 and Testimony 4. But wait, looking at the actual testimony texts:

Testimony 4: "The knife wound is quite deep, and continues to throb with pain." Person: Sorin.

Evidence 17: Candelabra with fingerprints and blood.

So Sorin refers to a knife wound, but the weapon was a candelabra. That's a contradiction because a candelabra isn't a knife. Therefore, Evidence 17 contradicts Testimony 4.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer should be {"evidence": 17, "testimony": 4}.

{"evidence": 17, "testimony": 4}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is asking which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants me to pick one pair. Let me start by going through the provided information step by step.

First, the characters. The important ones here might be Pierce Nichody (Character 9) since he's the one giving the testimonies. The victim is Dumas Gloomsbury (Character 7). Ellen Wyatt is the client, and Sorin Sprocket is her fiancé. 

Looking at the evidences, there are quite a few. Let's list the ones that might relate to Nichody's testimonies. For example, the Autopsy Report (14) says the victim was hit twice with the Time Keeper. Then there's the Hold Entry Record (15), which tracks key card access. The Candelabra (17) has Gloomsbury's left-hand fingerprints and blood matching the lift. The Broken Lantern (5) mentions the body was found there, with a bloodstain on the wheel handle. Sorin's Notebook (18) has a torn page. The Key of Love (20) activates the Time Keeper.

Now the testimonies from Nichody. Testimony 3 says he tore the page out of Sorin's notebook to protect him. Testimony 4 says he hid the body in the Pegabull lantern in the hold. Testimony 5 reiterates that he tore the page to protect Sorin. 

Looking for contradictions: If Nichody claims he tore the page from the notebook (Testimony 3 and 5), but there's evidence about the notebook. Evidence 18 is Sorin's Notebook, which mentions that a page was torn out. So that matches. But maybe there's another contradiction. Let's check other testimonies. 

Testimony 4: Nichody says he hid the body in the Pegabull lantern in the hold. The Broken Lantern (Evidence 5) states that the lantern was wheeled from the hold to the reception hall by Larry before the reception began. Wait, if Larry moved the lantern from the hold to the reception hall before the reception, then how could Nichody later hide the body in the lantern in the hold? Because if the lantern was already moved to the reception hall, then Nichody couldn't have hidden the body in the hold's lantern. Unless there's a spare lantern. Let me check the exact wording. 

Evidence 5 says: "The Pegabull lantern in which the victim's body was found. Larry wheeled it from the hold to the reception hall before the reception began. [...] The restored lantern. There's a bloodstain on the inside wheel handle, as if somebody gripped it with a bloody hand."

Wait, but Testimony 4 says Nichody hid the body in the "spare Pegabull lantern" in the hold. So maybe there are multiple lanterns. The evidence says that Larry moved "the lantern" (the Pegabull lantern) to the reception hall. Then Nichody used a spare one in the hold. But Evidence 5's description says that the body was found in the lantern that Larry moved. Wait, the first part of Evidence 5 says "The lantern in which the victim's body was found. Larry wheeled it from the hold to the reception hall before the reception began." So if the body was found in that lantern, but Nichody claims he put it into the spare lantern in the hold, that's a contradiction. Because the body was actually in the lantern that Larry had moved. So Nichody's Testimony 4 says he put the body in the hold's spare lantern, but the evidence (Broken Lantern, Evidence 5) shows the body was in the lantern that was moved to the reception hall. Therefore, Nichody's testimony about hiding the body in the hold's lantern contradicts the evidence that the body was in the reception hall's lantern. 

Wait, but Evidence 5 also mentions that after restoring the lantern, there's a bloodstain on the inside wheel handle. And the body was found in that lantern. So Nichody's Testimony 4 says he put the body in the hold's spare lantern, but the body was actually found in the lantern that Larry had moved to the reception hall. Therefore, this is a contradiction between Testimony 4 and Evidence 5. 

So the contradiction would be: Nichody claims he hid the body in the hold's spare lantern (Testimony 4), but the body was found in the lantern that was already moved to the reception hall (Evidence 5). Therefore, Testimony 4 and Evidence 5 contradict each other. 

Another possibility: Looking at Testimony 3 where Nichody says he tore the page out of Sorin's notebook. The notebook (Evidence 18) does mention a torn page. But that's consistent. No contradiction there. 

Another angle: Gloomsbury's Note (Evidence 7) is written as if by a right-handed person, but the Candelabra (Evidence 17) has his left-hand fingerprints, which is his dominant hand. That could suggest the note was written by someone else. But this doesn't directly contradict any testimony. 

Testimony 0: Nichody says he rushed to the vista deck but the crime was already committed. If there's evidence about the timeline, maybe. But not sure. 

So the main contradiction seems to be Testimony 4 (Nichody hid the body in the hold's spare lantern) vs Evidence 5 (the body was found in the lantern moved to the reception hall). Therefore, the pair is Evidence 5 and Testimony 4.

{"evidence": 5, "testimony": 4}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's start by looking at the problem. We need to find a contradiction between one of the testimonies given by Nichody and the evidence provided. Let's go through each testimony and see which evidence might contradict it.

First, let's list out Nichody's testimonies:

Testimony 0: ............

Testimony 1: Gloomsbury was my right hand man. I'd suffer the most from losing him.

Testimony 2: ............

Testimony 3: I've never thought of exacting revenge on Master Sorin.

Testimony 4: ............

Testimony 5: I was always in the company of others. I didn't have the opportunity to murder Gloomsbury.

Now, looking at the evidence, especially any that might relate to Nichody's statements. Let's check each testimony for possible contradictions.

Starting with Testimony 3: Nichody claims he never thought of revenge on Sorin. But looking at the evidence, maybe there's something that suggests he had a motive. Let's see. Evidence 19 is a newspaper article about Selena Sprocket's car accident where Sorin was driving. If Nichody was close to Selena, maybe he holds a grudge against Sorin. But how does that tie to Nichody's testimony? The testimony says he never thought of revenge, but maybe evidence shows he had a reason. However, the evidence doesn't directly link Nichody to Selena. Wait, but Evidence 9 is the Business Card Wallet with a familiar imprint. Not sure. Alternatively, Evidence 11 is a photo of Selena, maybe connecting her to Nichody?

Alternatively, Testimony 5: Nichody says he was always with others, so no opportunity. But if evidence shows he could have been alone, that contradicts. Let's check the evidence related to opportunity. Evidence 15 is the Hold Entry Record, which logs key card access. If Nichody's key was used to enter the hold, that might place him there. But the testimony says he was always with others, so if his key card was used, that contradicts his alibi. But does the evidence mention his key card? The Hold Entry Record (15) lists key cards used; if Nichody's card was in the record, he might have accessed the hold alone. But the problem is we don't know the specifics of the entry record. Maybe another evidence?

Looking at Evidence 17: Candelabra with Gloomsbury's left hand fingerprints (he's right-handed according to Note 7). Wait, the note says the writing was smudged as if by a right-handed person, but the candelabra has Gloomsbury's left hand prints. Wait, that's a contradiction for Gloomsbury's handedness. But how does that relate to Nichody's testimony?

Alternatively, Testimony 1: Nichody says Gloomsbury was his right-hand man, so he'd suffer the most. But maybe evidence shows that Nichody had a motive to kill Gloomsbury, like if Gloomsbury knew something incriminating. But not sure. Let's check Evidence 9: Business Card Wallet with a suspicious imprint. Maybe that's connected to Nichody's pocket watch (Character 9's description mentions he's attached to a pocket watch). If the imprint is from the pocket watch, maybe it's his. But how does that contradict a testimony?

Testimony 5: Nichody claims he was with others. If there's evidence that he was in the hold alone, that contradicts. Evidence 13 is a photo of the hold taken by Larry, showing Ellen. But maybe Nichody was there too? Not sure. Alternatively, Evidence 15 (Hold Entry Record) could show that Nichody's key card was used to enter the hold, which would mean he was there, contradicting his alibi. But since we don't have the exact details of the entry record, maybe another angle.

Wait, Evidence 16: Lift Bloodstain matches the candelabra's blood. If Nichody was in the lift, his blood could be there. But if he was supposed to be with others, his blood being there would mean he was present. However, the bloodstain's origin isn't clear. Alternatively, Evidence 5: Broken Lantern's inside wheel handle has a bloodstain. If Nichody's fingerprints or something is there, but the evidence says it's a bloody hand grip. But how does that connect to his testimony?

Another angle: Testimony 3 where Nichody denies wanting revenge. Evidence 19: Sorin was driving in the accident that killed Selena. If Nichody was close to Selena (maybe he was her lover or had a connection), he might want revenge on Sorin. But his testimony says he never thought of that. So if there's evidence linking him to Selena, that contradicts. Evidence 11 is Selena's photo taken in an office. Maybe Nichody had a connection to her. But how is that proven?

Alternatively, Evidence 9: Business Card Wallet with an imprint. If the imprint is from Nichody's pocket watch (since he's attached to it), then the wallet might be his, which could link him to some plan. But how does that tie to revenge? Maybe the wallet was found near the scene, implying he was involved.

Wait, maybe Testimony 5's alibi is contradicted by Evidence 15 (Hold Entry Record). If the record shows Nichody accessed the hold alone, then his claim of being with others is false. But without knowing the exact entries in Evidence 15, it's hard to say. However, perhaps another evidence: Evidence 13 (Photo of Hold) shows Ellen, but maybe Nichody was also there. But the photo was taken by Larry, and Ellen is in the center. Not sure.

Alternatively, the key contradiction might be between Testimony 5 (alibi) and Evidence 15. Suppose the Hold Entry Record shows that Nichody's key card was used to access the hold at a time when he claims to be with others. But since we don't know the exact data in Evidence 15, maybe another angle.

Wait, Testimony 5: Nichody says he was always with others. But if the murder required someone to be alone, and evidence shows that the murderer had to be alone. For example, the Time Keeper (Evidence 4) was activated, maybe requiring someone to set it up. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, Evidence 17: Candelabra has Gloomsbury's left hand fingerprints, but the note (Evidence 7) was written by a right-handed person. This suggests that the note was written by someone else (right-handed), possibly Nichody. If Nichody is right-handed, then the note (smudged as right-handed) could be his, contradicting his testimony. But which testimony?

Wait, Testimony 1 says Gloomsbury was his right-hand man. But if the note (Evidence 7) is written by a right-handed person, and Gloomsbury was left-handed (since the candelabra has his left hand prints as dominant), then the note couldn't have been written by Gloomsbury. So if Nichody is right-handed, the note was written by him, indicating he was present. But how does that contradict his testimonies? If the note was found near the victim, maybe Nichody wrote it, implying his involvement, which contradicts his alibi in Testimony 5. But how?

Alternatively, if the note (Evidence 7) is written by a right-handed person, and Nichody is right-handed, then he could have written it, which might imply he was at the scene. This would contradict Testimony 5 where he claims he was always with others. But the note's content isn't given, so it's hard to say. Alternatively, if the note is a suicide note, but the autopsy shows murder. However, the contradiction here might not be direct.

Another angle: Evidence 9 (Business Card Wallet) with a familiar imprint. If Nichody's pocket watch (Character 9's description) made the imprint, then the wallet is his. If the wallet was found in a place that contradicts his testimony, but the connection isn't clear.

Wait, the key contradiction might be between Testimony 3 ("I've never thought of exacting revenge on Master Sorin") and Evidence 19, where Sorin caused Selena's death. If Nichody had a motive related to Selena, then his denial of wanting revenge would be contradicted. For example, if Selena was someone Nichody cared about, then Evidence 19 shows Sorin was responsible for her death, giving Nichody a motive. Therefore, Testimony 3 is contradicted by Evidence 19. However, the problem is that we don't have explicit evidence linking Nichody to Selena. But perhaps the photo of Selena (Evidence 11) in an office might imply that Nichody, as the butler, worked with her and thus had a connection. If so, he would have a motive for revenge against Sorin, which would contradict Testimony 3.

So the pair would be Evidence 19 and Testimony 3.

{"evidence": 19, "testimony": 3}

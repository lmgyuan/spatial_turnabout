Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the task is to find which evidence contradicts one of the testimonies provided. The user wants only one pair: an evidence number and a testimony number that conflict each other.

First, I'll start by reviewing the testimonies given by Will Powers (Testimonies 0 to 5). Let me list them out:

Testimony 0: He was in the hallway to go to the bathroom.
Testimony 1: Saw a bellboy come out of the room (Corrida's room).
Testimony 2: Confirms the room was Corrida's.
Testimony 3: The bellboy seemed out of place.
Testimony 4: It was strange the bellboy came out empty-handed.
Testimony 5: Concludes the bellboy is the assassin.

Now, looking at the evidences, I need to find which one contradicts any of these statements. Let's go through some key evidences that might relate to the bellboy or the scenario described.

Evidence 30: Bellboy's Uniform. It mentions that the uniform is from De Killer's hideout and that a special button is missing. If De Killer was posing as the bellboy, but the uniform's button is missing, maybe there's a connection here.

Wait, Testimony 4 says the bellboy came out empty-handed. But if the bellboy was actually De Killer, maybe he was carrying something. Wait, but the testimony says he came out empty-handed. Let me check the evidence related to the bellboy.

Wait, the Radio Transceiver (Evidence 4) is from the Bellboy, originally from De Killer. But how does that connect? Also, there's the Guitar Case (Evidence 7) found next to the victim. It's empty, with water on the lid. The Crime Photo (Evidence 9) mentions a smashed vase with water on the carpet. Maybe the bellboy took something from the room, like the guitar case's contents, but the testimony says he was empty-handed.

Alternatively, the Security Lady (Character 3) is Wendy Oldbag. There's an Autograph (Evidence 10) from Corrida to her. Not sure how that connects here.

Wait, the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was in a stuffed bear in the victim's room. Engarde bought a stuffed bear (Evidence 24). The Spy Camera was set to record from 8 PM. The murder was at 8:15 PM. But how does this relate to the testimonies?

Wait, Testimony 4 says the bellboy came out empty-handed. But if De Killer (as the bellboy) was the killer, he might have taken something. For example, maybe the knife (Evidence 15) or the guitar case. But the guitar case was found empty. Alternatively, the knife was left there with Engarde's fingerprints. Hmm.

Wait, the Knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints. The Jammin' Ninja's Button (Evidence 16) was found in Engarde's hakama. But that's about Engarde. How does that relate to the bellboy's testimony?

Wait, the Bellboy's Uniform (Evidence 30) is missing a button. The Guitar Case (Evidence 7) has water on top. The Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows a smashed vase with water. If the bellboy was carrying the guitar case, which was found empty, but the testimony says he came out empty-handed, but the guitar case was already there. Wait, maybe the Guitar Case was supposed to have something in it. The evidence says it's empty, but if the bellboy took the contents, then he wasn't empty-handed. But the testimony says he was. So if the bellboy took something, but the testimony says he was empty-handed, that would be a contradiction. But the Guitar Case is found empty, so maybe he took the weapon, but the knife was left there. Hmm.

Alternatively, looking at Evidence 30, the Bellboy's Uniform has a missing button. Maybe the Jammin' Ninja's Button (Evidence 16) is that missing button. But Evidence 16's button is from the Jammin' Ninja costume, covered in Corrida's blood, found in Engarde's hakama. That's not directly related to the bellboy's uniform's button. Unless... but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's go back to Testimony 4: "I thought it was kinda strange for a bellboy to come out of a guest's room empty-handed!" So Powers is saying the bellboy didn't carry anything out. But if the bellboy (De Killer) took something, like the Guitar Case's contents, but the case was found empty. Wait, the Guitar Case was found next to the victim, empty. So if the bellboy took something from the case, he would have carried it out. But according to the testimony, he didn't. That would be a contradiction if there's evidence that something was taken.

Alternatively, the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was in the stuffed bear, which was set to record. Engarde bought the bear (Evidence 24). If the Spy Camera was transmitting via the Transmitter (Evidence 22), then perhaps the bellboy (De Killer) was there to retrieve the tape or something. But the Video Tape (Evidence 29) was retrieved from De Killer's hideout. If De Killer took the video tape from the room, then he would have carried it out. But according to Testimony 4, the bellboy came out empty-handed. So that would be a contradiction if the Video Tape was taken from the room. But the Video Tape is in the hideout, so maybe he did take it. Thus, Testimony 4 (bellboy empty-handed) contradicts Evidence 29 (Video Tape retrieved from De Killer's hideout, implying he took it). But how directly?

Alternatively, the Bellboy's Uniform (Evidence 30) is missing a button. If the bellboy (De Killer) was in the room, maybe the button was lost there. But the Jammin' Ninja's Button (Evidence 16) is from Corrida's costume. Not sure.

Wait, the Crime Photo (Evidence 9) mentions a smashed vase with water. The Guitar Case (Evidence 7) has water on the lid. So maybe the water came from the vase. The bellboy could have broken the vase, which was then found smashed. But that's not directly related to Testimony 4.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 1: "that bellboy came out of Corrida's room". If the murder happened at 8:15 PM, and the Spy Camera was recording from 8 PM, then maybe the camera captured the bellboy. But the Spy Camera's footage would show the room. However, Lotta's Photo (Evidence 17) shows a person in samurai garb outside the door. So maybe the killer was in samurai garb, not the bellboy. That would contradict Testimony 5 where Powers says the bellboy is the assassin.

Wait, let's check Evidence 17: Lotta's Photo is a picture taken in the hallway right after the murder, showing a person in samurai garb outside the door. So if the person in samurai garb was the killer, then the bellboy (De Killer) wasn't the one who did it. That would contradict Testimony 5 where Powers insists the bellboy is the assassin. But Testimony 5 is his conclusion. However, the photo (Evidence 17) shows someone else. So maybe Evidence 17 contradicts Testimony 5. But the question is to find a testimony that is contradicted by evidence. Testimony 5 is a conclusion, so maybe the photo shows the real killer in samurai garb, which would mean the bellboy (De Killer) wasn't the assassin. But according to the case, De Killer is the assassin, but he might have disguised as the bellboy. Wait, the problem is that the person in the photo is in samurai garb, but if the bellboy (De Killer) was the assassin, perhaps he changed clothes. Hmm.

Alternatively, Testimony 4 says the bellboy came out empty-handed. However, the Guitar Case (Evidence 7) was found empty. If the bellboy took the guitar, but the case was empty, then the bellboy would have been carrying the guitar. But the testimony says he was empty-handed. That's a contradiction. So Evidence 7 (Guitar Case empty) and Testimony 4 (bellboy came out empty-handed) would contradict. Because if the case was empty, the bellboy would have taken the guitar, hence not empty-handed. But the testimony says he was. But the Guitar Case was found empty, so if the bellboy took the guitar, then he wasn't empty-handed. Therefore, Testimony 4 is contradicted by Evidence 7. But wait, the Guitar Case's description says it's empty and has Corrida's fingerprints. So the guitar was already gone before the bellboy came? Or the bellboy took it. If the case was found empty next to the victim, then maybe the bellboy took the contents. But if the bellboy left the room with the guitar, then Testimony 4 is wrong because he wasn't empty-handed. So Evidence 7 (empty guitar case) suggests that the guitar was taken, implying the bellboy carried it out, contradicting Testimony 4. That could be a possible pair.

But let me check other possibilities. For example, Testimony 3: "the bellboy did seem kinda out of place". The Bellboy's Uniform (Evidence 30) is from De Killer's hideout, and the real bellboy might not have been around. So if the uniform was a disguise, then the testimony about him being out of place would align. Not a contradiction here.

Another angle: The Knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints, but the bellboy (De Killer) is the assassin. However, De Killer might have framed Engarde. But this doesn't directly contradict a testimony.

Alternatively, the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was recording during the murder. If the footage shows the real killer, but the testimonies say it was the bellboy, that could contradict. But the Video Tape (Evidence 29) is from De Killer's hideout. If the video shows the real killer, but the Spy Camera's data was transmitted (Evidence 22), then maybe the footage would show the actual events. However, without knowing the contents, it's hard to say. But if Lotta's Photo (Evidence 17) shows a samurai-garbed person, that might indicate the killer was dressed as the Nickel Samurai (Matt Engarde's character), which would connect to Matt Engarde. But the button (Evidence 16) in Engarde's hakama would link him. But how does that relate to the testimonies?

Wait, Testimony 1 says the bellboy came out of Corrida's room. If the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was in the room, maybe it captured the killer. But the Video Tape (Evidence 29) from De Killer's hideout might have the footage. If the Video Tape shows that De Killer (as the bellboy) was in the room, that would support the testimony. But if the camera was in the stuffed bear, perhaps the footage shows the murder, but the killer was in samurai garb (from Lotta's Photo), not the bellboy. Then, the testimonies about the bellboy would be contradicted by the photo and the camera footage. But the user hasn't provided the contents of the Video Tape, just that it's retrieved. So maybe that's not the right path.

Going back to the initial thought: Testimony 4 says the bellboy came out empty-handed. But if the Guitar Case was empty and found next to the victim, implying that the contents (like a guitar) were taken, then the bellboy should have been carrying it. Therefore, Testimony 4's claim that he was empty-handed contradicts Evidence 7 (Guitar Case being empty, suggesting the contents were taken by someone). But wait, the Guitar Case's description says it's empty and has Corrida's fingerprints. So maybe Corrida brought it in and it was already empty. Then the bellboy didn't take anything. So that might not be a contradiction. Hmm.

Alternatively, the Wine Glass (Evidence 8) has Andrews' fingerprints. If the bellboy took the glass, but it's found there, that's not the case. Maybe not relevant.

Looking at Evidence 30 again: Bellboy's Uniform missing a button. If the button was found somewhere else, but the only button in evidence is the Jammin' Ninja's Button (Evidence 16). Not matching. So that's not it.

Wait, the Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows a glass of juice, a bottle, and the guitar case. The Guitar Case is empty. The vase is smashed with water. If the bellboy took something, like the knife, but the knife is found at the scene (Evidence 15), so he didn't take that. The murder weapon (knife) is there. So maybe the bellboy didn't take anything. Then Testimony 4 is accurate. Hmm.

Alternatively, the Radio Transceiver (Evidence 4) is from De Killer. The testimony says the bellboy came out of the room, but if De Killer used the transceiver to communicate, perhaps he was coordinating. But that doesn't contradict the testimony.

Wait, let's think about the timeline. Time of death is 8:15 PM (Evidence 14). The Spy Camera was recording from 8 PM. So if the camera was in the room, it should have captured the murder. The Video Tape (Evidence 29) is from De Killer's hideout and he tried to recover it. If the tape shows the real killer, then maybe the bellboy wasn't the one. But without knowing the contents, it's hard. However, the fact that De Killer tried to recover the tape suggests it incriminates him. So if the tape shows De Killer (as the bellboy) committing the murder, then the testimonies are correct. But if the tape shows someone else, then contradiction. But since we don't know the contents, maybe it's not the right evidence.

Alternatively, the stuffed bear (Evidence 23) with the spy camera was in the room. Engarde bought an identical bear (Evidence 24), which suggests he planted the camera. If Engarde set up the camera to spy on Corrida, then maybe he knew about the murder. But how does that relate to the testimonies?

Wait, the Jammin' Ninja's Button (Evidence 16) found in Engarde's hakama suggests Engarde was at the scene. But Testimony 5 says the bellboy is the assassin. If Engarde was involved, then perhaps the button contradicts the testimony. But the button is from Corrida's costume, covered in his blood, found in Engarde's clothing. So maybe Engarde attacked Corrida, which would mean the bellboy (De Killer) wasn't the actual killer. But according to the autopsy, cause of death is strangulation and stabbing. The knife has Engarde's prints. So the real killer is Engarde, but De Killer might have been involved. But the testimonies blame the bellboy. So the contradiction would be between the knife with Engarde's prints (Evidence 15) and Testimony 5 (bellboy is assassin). But the question is to find evidence and testimony that contradict each other directly.

Alternatively, the person in samurai garb in Lotta's Photo (Evidence 17) is Engarde as the Nickel Samurai. If the photo shows the Nickel Samurai (Engarde's character) at the scene, that contradicts Testimony 5's claim that the bellboy is the assassin. Because the photo shows someone else. So Evidence 17 contradicts Testimony 5.

Yes, this seems plausible. Testimony 5 says the bellboy is the assassin, but Lotta's Photo (Evidence 17) shows a person in samurai garb (possibly Engarde) at the scene right after the murder. That would indicate that the assassin was in samurai costume, not the bellboy. Therefore, Evidence 17 contradicts Testimony 5.

But let me check the details of Evidence 17: Picture taken in the Hallway right after the murder. A person in samurai garb stands outside the door. So if the murder happened in Corrida's room, and the photo shows someone in samurai garb (like the Nickel Samurai) leaving the scene, that would suggest the killer was dressed as the Nickel Samurai, which is Engarde's character. Therefore, the photo contradicts Testimony 5's conclusion that the bellboy is the assassin.

Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 17 and Testimony 5.

{"evidence": 17, "testimony": 5}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is asking which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants one pair, so I need to look through all the testimonies and evidences to find a direct contradiction.

First, let me look at the testimonies provided by Shelly de Killer. The testimonies are numbered 0 to 6. Let me read through each one:

Testimony 0: Adrian Andrews is his client. However... (Not sure yet)
Testimony 1: He can't overlook tampering with the crime scene.
Testimony 2: His client (Andrews) did it to frame someone else.
Testimony 3: Pretending to be the first to discover the body and enter the scene.
Testimony 4: Andrews already knew Corrida was dead when she entered.
Testimony 5: The creation and planting of the knife and button is appalling.
Testimony 6: That act (planting evidence) is breaking the rules.

So, de Killer's main point is that Andrews tampered with the scene by planting evidence (knife and button) to frame someone else (probably Engarde). The key contradiction would be if there's evidence that shows Andrews couldn't have planted those items, or if the evidence points to someone else.

Looking at the evidences:

Evidence 8 is the Wine Glass with Andrews' fingerprints. According to her statement, she poured the juice for Corrida, thinking he was just unconscious, not dead. But the autopsy (Evidence 14) says the cause was strangulation and stabbing. If she found him already dead, why pour juice? That could be a contradiction, but how does that relate to the testimony?

Evidence 15 is the Knife with Engarde's fingerprints. De Killer's testimony 5 says the knife was planted by Andrews. But if the knife has Engarde's prints, that would support the framing. However, maybe there's evidence that the knife couldn't have been planted by Andrews.

Wait, Evidence 24: Credit Card Receipt shows Engarde bought a stuffed bear identical to the one with the spy camera (Evidence 23 and 24). The spy camera was in the bear's eye, which was in the victim's room. The camera was set to record from 8 PM. The receipt proves Engarde bought the bear, so maybe he's the one who set up the camera, not Andrews. But how does that relate to the planted knife?

Alternatively, let's look at Evidence 8 again. Andrews says she poured the juice when she found Corrida. The Wine Glass (Evidence 8) has her fingerprints, which she explains as her pouring the juice. But if Corrida was already dead, then she would have known he was dead when she poured the juice. However, de Killer's testimony 4 says Andrews already knew he was dead when she entered. So if she poured the juice after finding him dead, that's suspicious. But how does that contradict the testimony? The testimony says she knew he was dead, but she claims she thought he was just unconscious. The presence of her fingerprints on the glass supports her action of pouring juice, but if she knew he was dead, why pour it? That could be a contradiction between her statement and the testimony. But the question is about evidence contradicting testimony, not her statement.

Wait, the problem says "which evidence and testimony contradict each other." So the testimony is from de Killer, and the evidence must directly contradict something he said.

Looking at Testimony 5: de Killer says Andrews planted the knife and button. The knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints, which would support the idea that Engarde is the killer, but de Killer claims Andrews planted it. However, if the knife has Engarde's prints, that could imply that Engarde handled it, unless Andrews somehow got Engarde's prints on it. But is there evidence that Andrews couldn't have planted it?

Wait, Evidence 24: Engarde bought the stuffed bear. The spy camera (Evidence 21, 23) was in the bear. The video from the spy camera would show what happened. If the video exists (Evidence 29 is a video tape retrieved from de Killer's hideout, contents unknown), but the spy camera was running during the murder. If the video shows the real killer, that could contradict de Killer's testimony that Andrews planted the knife. But since the video's contents are unknown, maybe not.

Alternatively, the Autopsy Report (Evidence 14) says the cause was strangulation and then stabbing. The knife is the murder weapon with Engarde's prints. But if the stabbing was post-mortem, maybe the real cause was strangulation, and the knife was planted. But the autopsy says the cause was both. Hmm.

Wait, de Killer's Testimony 5 says Andrews planted the knife and button. But Evidence 16 is the Jammin' Ninja's button found in Engarde's hakama. If Andrews planted it, how did she get the button? The button is covered in Corrida's blood. If Corrida was already dead, maybe she took the button from the scene and planted it on Engarde. But how does that contradict with any evidence?

Alternatively, the Wine Glass (Evidence 8) has Andrews' fingerprints, which she says is because she poured the juice for Corrida. But if de Killer's Testimony 4 is correct that Andrews knew he was dead when she entered, then her action of pouring the juice would be an act to stage the scene, making her look like she didn't know he was dead. The presence of her fingerprints supports her story, but de Killer's testimony contradicts that. However, the evidence itself (her fingerprints on the glass) doesn't necessarily contradict the testimony; it could be part of her staging. So maybe not a direct contradiction.

Another angle: The knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints and the engraving "Gatewater." If Engarde is the owner of the knife, then how could Andrews have planted it? Unless she stole it from Engarde. But there's no evidence pointing to that. Alternatively, the knife was from the hotel (Gatewater engraved), so maybe it's a hotel knife. If Andrews had access to Engarde's fingerprints, she could have planted them. But how?

Wait, Evidence 24 shows Engarde bought the stuffed bear. The spy camera in the bear (Evidence 23) was set up by Engarde, as per the receipt. So Engarde had a camera in the room, which would have recorded the murder. If the video shows that Engarde is the killer, then de Killer's testimony that Andrews planted the knife would be contradicted by the video evidence. However, since the video's contents are unknown (Evidence 29's details are not known unless asked), maybe we can't use that. Alternatively, the existence of the spy camera set by Engarde implies that he was monitoring the victim, which could mean he was involved in the murder, contradicting de Killer's claim that Andrews framed him. But again, without seeing the video, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, the Guitar Case (Evidence 7) has Corrida's fingerprints and water on the lid. The crime photo (Evidence 9) shows the smashed vase with water on the carpet. The water on the guitar case lid might have come from the vase. If the guitar case was moved after the vase broke, that could indicate someone tampered with the scene. But how does that relate to the testimony?

Wait, Testimony 3 and 4: de Killer says Andrews pretended to be the first to discover the body but knew he was dead. The Security Lady (Character 3) might have seen something, but not sure.

Wait, the key contradiction is in the planted evidence. de Killer's Testimony 5 says Andrews planted the knife and button. But if there's evidence that shows those items couldn't have been planted by Andrews, that would contradict.

Looking at Evidence 16: Jammin' Ninja's Button found in Engarde's hakama. If the button was ripped from Corrida's costume during a struggle, then it would have his blood. If Andrews planted it, she would have to take it from the scene and put it in Engarde's clothing. But if Engarde's hakama was in his own possession, how would Andrews plant it there? Unless she had access to his clothing. But perhaps the button was found in the crime scene, not in Engarde's hakama. Wait, no, Evidence 16 says it was found in Engarde's hakama. So how did it get there? If Andrews planted it, she must have placed it there. But if Engarde was the killer, he would have the button. So, if the button was found in Engarde's possession, that supports his guilt, which is what Andrews would want if she's framing him. But the contradiction would be if there's evidence that shows Andrews couldn't have planted it.

Alternatively, the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was recording during the murder. If the video shows someone else (like de Killer) committing the murder, then Andrews couldn't have planted the evidence. But since the video's contents are unknown, maybe not.

Wait, the key here is that de Killer's testimony claims Andrews planted the knife and button. The knife has Engarde's fingerprints, and the button is in Engarde's clothing. If the spy camera footage (from the bear that Engarde bought) shows that Engarde wasn't present, then the fingerprints on the knife would have been planted. But without the footage, we can't confirm. However, there's Evidence 24: the receipt showing Engarde bought the bear. That means he placed the spy camera in the room. If the camera was recording, then the real killer would be captured. If the killer was someone else (like de Killer), then the knife with Engarde's prints must have been planted. But the receipt (Evidence 24) directly links Engarde to the spy camera, suggesting he was monitoring the victim. This might indicate that Engarde had a motive and planned the murder, contradicting de Killer's claim that Andrews framed him. But how does that directly contradict the testimony?

Alternatively, the Knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints. If Engarde's fingerprints are on the knife, and the testimony says Andrews planted it, that implies she somehow got his fingerprints on it. However, if the knife was purchased or obtained by Engarde, then his fingerprints being there are natural. But if the knife was from the hotel (Gatewater engraved), maybe Andrews could have taken it from Engarde's room and used it. But there's no evidence of that.

Wait, the Wine Glass (Evidence 8) has Andrews' fingerprints and she admits to pouring the juice. If she was the one who poured the juice after the murder, then she was at the scene. But de Killer's testimony says she tampered with the scene by planting the knife and button. If the knife was already there when she arrived, she couldn't have planted it. But if the knife was placed after the murder, she could have. However, the autopsy says the cause was stabbing and strangulation. If the stabbing was part of the murder, then the knife was used during the murder. If Andrews arrived after the murder, she couldn't have used the knife, so planting it would mean placing it there after. But the knife has Engarde's prints. So if Andrews planted it, she must have somehow obtained a knife with Engarde's prints. But if Engarde's prints are on the knife because he used it, then he's the killer. Alternatively, if the prints were planted, how?

Alternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (Andrews planted the knife) and Evidence 15 (knife has Engarde's prints). If the prints are genuine, then Engarde handled the knife, which could mean he's the killer, supporting that Andrews framed him by placing the knife there. But de Killer's testimony says Andrews planted it. So that's not a contradiction, but rather supporting the testimony.

Wait, maybe the key is the time of death. The Autopsy Report (Evidence 14) says time of death is 8:15 PM. The Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was set to record from 8 PM for 1 hour. So the camera was active during the murder. If the camera footage shows someone else (like de Killer) committing the murder, then the knife with Engarde's prints must have been planted. But since the Video Tape (Evidence 29) was retrieved from de Killer's hideout and he tried to recover it, the tape might show the real killer. If the tape shows de Killer committing the murder, then the knife with Engarde's prints was planted, which would support that Andrews (or someone else) framed Engarde. However, without knowing the tape's contents, this is speculative.

Alternatively, consider the Stuffed Bear (Evidence 23) and the Credit Card Receipt (Evidence 24). The receipt shows Engarde bought the bear, meaning he placed the spy camera in the victim's room. If the camera was recording, Engarde would have footage of the murder. If Engarde was the one who set up the camera, he might have known about the murder in advance. This could imply he's involved, which contradicts de Killer's testimony that Andrews framed him. But de Killer's testimony says Andrews planted the evidence. If Engarde set up the camera, that suggests he had a plan, possibly to monitor the murder, which could mean he's the culprit, contradicting the testimony that Andrews framed him. However, the testimony is that Andrews planted the knife and button, not necessarily that Engarde is innocent. So this might not be a direct contradiction.

Wait, maybe the key is the Water on the Guitar Case (Evidence 7). The Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows a smashed vase with water on the carpet. The Guitar Case has water on the lid. If the vase was broken during the murder, the water would spill. The Guitar Case's lid has water on top, meaning it was placed there after the vase broke. If the killer moved the Guitar Case after the vase broke, that could indicate tampering. But how does this relate to the testimony?

Alternatively, the Magazine Clipping (Evidence 11) suggests Corrida was having an affair with Adrian Andrews (A.A.), which gives her a motive. But de Killer's testimony says she framed Engarde. If she had a motive, maybe she killed him and framed Engarde. But that's not a contradiction between evidence and testimony.

Wait, the Autopsy Report says Corrida was strangled and then stabbed. The order is important. If he was strangled first, the stabbing might have been post-mortem. The knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's prints. If the stabbing was after death, then the killer could have planted the knife. But the autopsy says both were causes of death. Hmm.

Alternatively, let's think about the timeline. The murder happened at 8:15 PM. The Spy Camera was recording from 8 PM. So the camera should have captured the murder. The Video Tape (Evidence 29) is from de Killer's hideout, which he tried to recover. If the tape shows the real killer, then the planted evidence (knife and button) would be exposed as fake. However, the testimony claims Andrews planted them. If the tape shows that the killer was someone else (like de Killer), then the planted evidence is fake, which supports de Killer's testimony. But how does that contradict?

Alternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 4 (Andrews knew Corrida was dead when she entered) and the Wine Glass (Evidence 8) with her prints. If she poured the juice thinking he was alive (as she claims), but the testimony says she knew he was dead, then the presence of the glass with her prints supports her claim, but the testimony contradicts it. However, this is a contradiction between her statement and the testimony, not between evidence and testimony. The evidence itself (the glass with her prints) doesn't contradict the testimony; it's her explanation versus the testimony.

Wait, the question is about evidence contradicting testimony. So I need to find an evidence item that directly contradicts a testimony statement.

Looking back at Testimony 5: de Killer says Andrews planted the knife and button. The button is found in Engarde's hakama (Evidence 16). If Engarde's hakama was in his possession, how could Andrews plant it there? Unless she had access to his clothing. But if Engarde was wearing the hakama during the murder, and the button was found in it, then Andrews couldn't have planted it unless she took the hakama. But there's no evidence about that.

Alternatively, the Knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's prints. If the knife was planted by Andrews, she must have somehow obtained a knife with Engarde's prints. But if Engarde's prints are on the knife because he used it, then he's the killer. However, if the Spy Camera footage shows that someone else used the knife, then the prints must have been planted. But without the footage, we can't confirm.

Wait, the Security Lady (Character 3) is Wendy Oldbag, who has an autograph from Corrida (Evidence 10). Not sure if that's relevant.

Another angle: The Pistol (Evidence 28) was used by de Killer to shoot Franziska. If de Killer was involved, then he might have been the actual killer. If de Killer is the killer, then Andrews couldn't have killed Corrida, which contradicts de Killer's testimony that she framed someone. But this is more about the killer's identity, not the evidence planting.

Alternatively, the Bellboy's Uniform (Evidence 30) is missing a button. The Guitar Case has water on the lid. If the uniform's missing button is related to the crime scene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the key contradiction might be between Testimony 3 and 4 (Andrews pretended to be the first to discover the body but knew he was dead) and the Spy Camera. If the camera recorded Andrews entering the room after the murder and tampering with the scene, that would support de Killer's testimony. But the existence of the camera (Evidence 21) was set by Engarde, as per the receipt (Evidence 24). If the camera was recording, then the footage would show if Andrews planted the evidence. However, the Video Tape (Evidence 29) is in de Killer's possession, which he tried to recover. If the tape shows Andrews planting the evidence, then it supports de Killer's testimony. But since the tape's contents are unknown, maybe that's not the contradiction.

Alternatively, the Magazine Clipping (Evidence 11) shows that Corrida and Andrews were in a relationship, which could give Andrews a motive. However, de Killer's testimony says she framed Engarde. But that's not a contradiction.

Wait, maybe the key is the Autopsy Report (Evidence 14) stating the cause of death as strangulation and stabbing. The Knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's prints, but if the stabbing was after death, then the knife wasn't the murder weapon for the actual cause (strangulation). But the autopsy says both were causes. So maybe the stabbing was part of the murder, meaning the knife was used. If Engarde's prints are on the knife, he's the killer. But de Killer says Andrews planted the knife. So the contradiction would be if there's evidence that the knife couldn't have been planted by Andrews.

Alternatively, the Knife has "Gatewater" engraved (Evidence 15). If the knife is from the hotel, then it's possible that Engarde was staying there and had access. But Andrews could have taken it from his room. But without evidence of her accessing his room, this is speculative.

Wait, the Figurine (Evidence 25) has a suicide note inside (Evidence 27) that implicates Engarde. If the note is genuine, then Engarde had a motive. But de Killer's testimony says Andrews framed him. If the note was planted by Andrews, that's part of the framing. But the existence of the note in the figurine (which only Corrida and Andrews knew how to open) suggests that Andrews had access. If she planted the note, that supports the framing. But this isn't a contradiction with the testimony.

Hmm, this is tricky. Let me recap:

De Killer's Testimony 5 and 6 say that Andrews planted the knife and button to frame Engarde. The key evidence planted would be the knife (Engarde's prints) and the button (from Corrida's costume in Engarde's hakama).

The contradiction would be if there's evidence showing that Andrews couldn't have planted those items. For example, if the knife was in a place only Engarde could have accessed, or if the button was ripped during a struggle that Engarde was part of.

Alternatively, the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) set by Engarde via the bear (Evidence 24) could have recorded the murder. If the Video Tape (Evidence 29) shows that Engarde wasn't present, then the knife with his prints must have been planted. But without knowing the tape's contents, we can't use that.

Wait, but the Spy Camera was running during the murder (8-9 PM). If the camera was in the room, it should have recorded the killer. The Video Tape (Evidence 29) is likely the footage from that camera. Since de Killer tried to recover it violently, maybe the tape shows him as the killer. If that's the case, then the knife with Engarde's prints was planted to frame him, which aligns with de Killer's testimony. But how does this contradict?

Alternatively, if the tape shows Andrews planting the knife, that supports the testimony. But again, without knowing the contents, this is guesswork.

Wait, the key is to find a direct contradiction between a specific evidence and a specific testimony. Let's look for an evidence that directly disproves what the testimony claims.

Testimony 5: "the creation and planting of the 'knife' and 'button'." So the testimony claims Andrews planted these.

Evidence 15: Knife with Engarde's fingerprints. If Engarde's fingerprints are on the knife, that suggests he handled it. But if the knife was planted by Andrews, how did she get his fingerprints? Unless she had access to something Engarde touched to transfer prints. However, there's no evidence that she did.

Evidence 16: Button with Corrida's blood in Engarde's hakama. If Andrews took the button from the crime scene and placed it in Engarde's clothing, that's possible. But how does the evidence contradict the testimony?

Wait, the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was recording. If the camera was set up by Engarde (Evidence 24), and the footage shows someone else (like de Killer) committing the murder, then the knife with Engarde's prints must have been planted. This would support de Killer's testimony that Andrews planted it. But how does the evidence contradict the testimony?

Alternatively, if the Spy Camera's existence (Evidence 21 and 24) shows that Engarde was monitoring the room, implying he had a plan, which contradicts the idea that Andrews framed him without his knowledge. But this is indirect.

Wait, perhaps the key is the Wine Glass (Evidence 8) with Andrews' fingerprints. De Killer's Testimony 4 says she knew Corrida was dead when she entered. If she poured the juice after he was dead, that's part of her tampering. But the presence of her fingerprints on the glass supports her action of pouring the juice. However, this doesn't directly contradict the testimony. The testimony is about her knowledge, not her actions.

Wait, the Autopsy Report (Evidence 14) says the time of death was 8:15 PM. The Press Conference Ticket (Evidence 3) says the Nickel Samurai (Engarde) was to confess something after the stage show. If Engarde was at the press conference at 8:15 PM, he has an alibi. But there's no evidence about his whereabouts.

Alternatively, the Security Lady (Wendy Oldbag) might have seen Engarde, but no evidence mentions that.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to think of each testimony and see which evidence directly contradicts it.

Testimony 5: Andrews planted the knife and button.

If the knife was actually used by Engarde, then his prints being there are genuine, meaning he's the killer, and Andrews didn't plant it. But de Killer's testimony says she did. So the presence of Engarde's prints on the knife could be seen as supporting that he's the killer, but de Killer claims it was planted. The contradiction would be if there's evidence that the knife couldn't have been planted.

But how to determine that? Maybe the knife's origin. If the knife is from Engarde's possession, then Andrews could have taken it. If it's from the hotel (Gatewater), maybe anyone could have access.

Wait, the knife has "Gatewater" engraved (Evidence 15), so it's a hotel knife. So both Engarde and Andrews could have access. So Andrews could have taken a hotel knife, got Engarde's prints on it (somehow), and planted it. But without evidence of how she got the prints, this is possible.

Alternatively, the Spy Camera footage would show who used the knife. If the footage shows de Killer using it, then the prints must be planted. But since the footage is in Evidence 29 and its contents are unknown unless asked, we can't use it.

Wait, the Pistol (Evidence 28) was used by de Killer. If de Killer is the real killer, then the knife was planted. But again, without the video, this is speculative.

Alternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (Andrews planted the knife) and Evidence 15 (knife has Engarde's prints). If the prints are genuine, then Engarde used the knife, contradicting the testimony that Andrews planted it. But if the prints are genuine, then the knife wasn't planted by Andrews; Engarde actually used it, making de Killer's testimony false. But wait, de Killer's testimony says Andrews planted the knife to frame Engarde. If the knife was actually used by Engarde, then Andrews didn't plant it; she just framed him by using his actual knife. So the testimony would be partially true. Hmm.

Alternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 5 and Evidence 24 (Engarde bought the bear with the spy camera). If Engarde set up the camera to record the murder, he would know if Andrews tried to plant evidence. But this is indirect.

Wait, I think the key is the Spy Camera. The camera was recording during the murder (Evidence 21), set by Engarde (Evidence 24). If the camera was in the room, then the footage would show whether Andrews entered the room after the murder to plant the knife and button. If the footage shows that Andrews wasn't there, then she couldn't have planted them, contradicting Testimony 5. But since the Video Tape (Evidence 29) is retrieved and its contents are unknown, but de Killer tried to recover it, perhaps the tape shows that Andrews wasn't the one who planted the evidence. However, the user might be expecting the answer to be the Spy Camera evidence contradicting the testimony.

Alternatively, the existence of the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) and the receipt (Evidence 24) shows that Engarde set up surveillance, implying he was involved, which contradicts the testimony that Andrews framed him. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: The Wine Glass (Evidence 8) has Andrews' fingerprints. If she poured the juice after Corrida was dead (as per Testimony 4), then she knew he was dead and was staging the scene. But the presence of her prints doesn't contradict; it supports her being there. So no contradiction.

Wait, maybe the answer is Evidence 8 (Wine Glass with Andrews' fingerprints) and Testimony 4 (Andrews knew he was dead). The testimony says she knew he was dead when she entered, but the evidence (her pouring juice) suggests she thought he was alive. But this is a contradiction between her statement and the testimony, not between evidence and testimony. The evidence itself (her prints on the glass) doesn't contradict the testimony; it's her action that might.

I'm struggling here. Let me think of the answer that's commonly known in the game. In the game "Phoenix Wright: Justice for All," the case involving Matt Engarde and Juan Corrida. Shelly de Killer's testimony about Adrian Andrews planting the knife and button is contradicted by the spy camera footage showing that the murder was committed by de Killer, thus the knife with Engarde's prints was planted. The spy camera evidence (like the receipt and the camera) would show that Engarde set up the camera, and the video would show the truth. But since the video is Evidence 29, which is in the retrieved items, but the user hasn't provided details on it unless asked.

However, the key evidence that directly contradicts de Killer's testimony about Andrews planting the knife is the Spy Camera's existence. Since Engarde bought the bear (Evidence 24), he set up the camera. The camera was running during the murder (Evidence 21). Therefore, the footage would show the real killer, which is de Killer, proving that the knife was planted. Therefore, the existence of the spy camera (Evidence 21 or 24) contradicts de Killer's testimony that Andrews planted the evidence.

But which specific evidence number? Evidence 21 is the Spy Camera set to record, and Evidence 24 is the receipt proving Engarde bought the bear. The testimony is Testimony 5, which says Andrews planted the knife and button.

So, the evidence that Engarde set up the camera (Evidence 24) contradicts the testimony that Andrews planted the evidence, because the camera would show the real killer, thus the evidence was planted. Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 24 and Testimony 5.

But wait, the user wants only one pair. Let me check the numbering again.

Testimony 5: "But even more appalling is the creation and planting of the 'knife' and 'button'." So Testimony 5 is about Andrews planting those.

Evidence 24: Credit Card Receipt for Engarde buying the bear, which contained the spy camera. This shows that Engarde set up the camera, implying he was involved in monitoring the victim, which would suggest that he had a plan, possibly to commit the murder. If he set up the camera, then the knife with his prints might be genuine, contradicting the testimony that Andrews planted it. But if the camera's footage shows de Killer as the killer, then the knife was planted, which supports the testimony.

Alternatively, the existence of the spy camera (Evidence 21) which was set by Engarde (Evidence 24) would show that Engarde had the means to monitor the room, making it possible for him to be the killer or involved, thus the knife with his prints is genuine. This contradicts de Killer's testimony that Andrews planted the knife.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the Spy Camera's footage (if available) would show the real killer, but since it's in Evidence 29 and details are unknown, perhaps the key is Evidence 21 (Spy Camera set to record) and Testimony 5. The camera's existence means that there's video evidence of the murder, which would contradict the testimony that Andrews planted the knife if the video shows someone else.

But the user's answer expects a specific pair. In the game, the contradiction is between the spy camera (which shows de Killer) and the testimony. So the receipt (Evidence 24) that Engarde bought the bear, which contained the camera, is the evidence that shows he set up the camera, thus the footage exists. Therefore, the pair is Evidence 24 and Testimony 5.

But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, the Video Tape (Evidence 29) would be the direct contradiction, but since its details are unknown unless asked, perhaps it's not.

Another possibility: The Autopsy Report (Evidence 14) states the victim was strangled first, then stabbed. The knife with Engarde's prints was used for the stabbing, which might have been post-mortem. If the stabbing wasn't the cause of death, then the knife was planted. This would support de Killer's testimony. But the autopsy says both were causes.

Alternatively, the fact that the knife has Engarde's prints and the testimony says Andrews planted it—how could she get his prints? Unless she framed him by using a knife he touched earlier. But if the Spy Camera shows that Engarde never touched the knife during the murder, then the prints were planted. But again, without the footage, this is unclear.

In the game, the key contradiction is between the spy camera footage (showing de Killer) and the testimony. The evidence for the spy camera is the receipt (Evidence 24) and the camera (Evidence 21). The testimony is about Andrews planting the evidence.

So, the correct pair is Evidence 24 (Credit Card Receipt) and Testimony 5. Because the receipt shows Engarde bought the bear with the spy camera, which recorded the murder, proving that the knife was planted, thus contradicting de Killer's testimony that Andrews planted it (since the real killer was de Killer, and the knife was part of the frame-up orchestrated by Engarde and de Killer, not Andrews).

Wait, but in the game's plot, Adrian Andrews was framed by Matt Engarde and de Killer. The spy camera footage shows de Killer committing the murder, but the knife with Engarde's prints was planted to make it look like Engarde did it. However, de Killer's testimony is that Andrews planted the evidence, but in reality, it was Engarde and de Killer. So the contradiction is that the spy camera evidence (showing de Killer) proves that Andrews couldn't have planted the evidence, thus the testimony is false.

Therefore, the evidence that contradicts Testimony 5 is the Spy Camera's existence, which is linked to Engarde via the receipt (Evidence 24). Therefore, the pair is Evidence 24 and Testimony 5.

{"evidence": 24, "testimony": 5}

Okay, so I need to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let's start by looking at the testimonies from de Killer.

Testimony 3 says that one of the requests was to find the bear figurine and give it to Adrian Andrews. Now, looking at the evidence, there's the Figurine (Evidence 25) which is a wooden bear with thin cuts, and it's a puzzle that only Corrida and Andrews know how to open. Additionally, there's Celeste's Suicide Note (Evidence 27) found inside the figurine. 

But wait, de Killer's testimony says he was supposed to find the figurine and give it to Adrian. However, according to the Figurine's description, only Corrida and Andrews knew how to open it. If de Killer's client asked him to retrieve the figurine and give it to Adrian, but Adrian already knew how to open it, maybe there's a contradiction here. Let me check the testimonies again.

Testimony 3: de Killer's task included finding the bear figurine and giving it to Adrian Andrews. But if Adrian already had access to the figurine or knew how to open it, why would de Killer need to retrieve it? Or perhaps the client didn't know that Adrian could open it. Alternatively, maybe the client was someone else. Wait, also, the Figurine's evidence mentions that Andrews was going to burn it for her sake, implying she had it. So if Adrian already had the figurine, de Killer wouldn't need to find it. That's a contradiction. 

But wait, the Figurine (Evidence 25) was found, and Andrews says she was going to burn it. So maybe de Killer was supposed to take it from someone else and give it to her. However, if the client was Matt Engarde, for example, maybe he wanted to destroy evidence. But de Killer's testimony says he was supposed to find it and give it to Adrian. However, if Adrian already had it, then de Killer's testimony about needing to find it would be false. Alternatively, maybe the client didn't know where the figurine was, so de Killer had to find it. But the evidence shows that the figurine was in the victim's room or with Andrews. Hmm. 

Wait, looking at Evidence 25: Andrews says she was going to burn it for her sake. That suggests she had the figurine. So if de Killer's task was to find the figurine and give it to her, but she already had it, that contradicts. Therefore, de Killer's testimony about needing to find the figurine and give it to Adrian is contradicted by the fact that Adrian already had the figurine. Therefore, the evidence (25) and testimony (3) contradict each other. 

Alternatively, maybe the client wanted de Killer to retrieve the figurine from someone else and give it to Adrian. But if Adrian was the one who had it, then that's a problem. So the testimony says de Killer was supposed to find it and give it to Adrian, but if Adrian already had it, there's a contradiction. So the pair would be evidence 25 and testimony 3.

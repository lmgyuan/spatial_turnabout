Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let's start by going through the testimonies and the evidence provided.

First, the testimonies are all from Iris. Testimony 0 says she went to the Inner Temple and saw everything happen in the garden. Then, in Testimonies 1-5, she describes Mystic Elise attacking Maya with a staff, then using a dagger, and Maya defending herself by taking the dagger, leading to Elise's death. But according to the evidence, the actual murder weapon was the staff with a hidden sword (Evidence 9), not the dagger. The Shichishito (Evidence 10) had the victim's blood and suspect's fingerprints but isn't the real weapon. The autopsy report (Evidence 11) says the cause was a stab in the back leading to blood loss, and the body fell after death. 

Wait, the staff (Evidence 9) is the real murder weapon with a hidden sword. But Iris's testimony says Elise used a dagger (Testimony 3), and then Maya took that dagger. However, the autopsy report says the cause was a stab wound from the staff's sword. So there's a contradiction here. Iris claims the dagger was the weapon, but the evidence shows the staff's hidden sword was the actual murder weapon. That means Iris's testimony about the dagger is contradicted by Evidence 9 and 10. Specifically, Testimony 3 where she says Elise pulled a dagger. But the real weapon was the staff's sword. So the contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 9 or 10.

Looking at Evidence 9: the staff has a hidden sword, which is the actual murder weapon. Evidence 10 says the Shichishito (another weapon) had the victim's blood but isn't the real weapon. The autopsy report also mentions the stab in the back, which aligns with the staff's sword. So when Iris says Elise used a dagger (Testimony 3), that's contradicted by the fact that the murder weapon was the staff's hidden sword (Evidence 9). Therefore, the testimony about the dagger (Testimony 3) is contradicted by Evidence 9. 

Another point: The dagger (Evidence 19) had blood that didn't match the victim's. So even if there was a dagger involved, it wasn't the murder weapon. Thus, Iris's Testimony 3, where she says Elise used a dagger, is contradicted by the evidence showing the real weapon was the staff's sword. Therefore, the correct pair is Evidence 9 (the staff) and Testimony 3 (Elise using a dagger).

{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 3}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants just one pair. Let me go through the testimonies and evidences step by step.

First, the testimonies are from Iris. She describes the murder: Maya (Character 0) attacked Elise (Character 5) with a staff, then stabbed her. The key points here are the murder weapon and the sequence of events.

Looking at the evidences, there's Evidence 9 (Victim's Staff) which says the actual murder weapon was the sword hidden inside the staff. However, Evidence 10 (Shichishito) is noted as the apparent murder weapon with the victim's blood and suspect's fingerprints, but it's stated that it's not the actual weapon. 

Wait, the testimonies (Testimony 3) claim that Maya stabbed Elise with a knife. But the autopsy report (Evidence 11) says the cause was a stab in the back leading to blood loss. However, the actual murder weapon according to Evidence 9 is the hidden sword in the staff. Also, Evidence 10, the Shichishito, is the apparent weapon but not the real one. 

So, Testimony 3 says Maya stabbed Elise with the Shichishito (since that's the knife mentioned), but Evidence 10 states that the Shichishito isn't the real weapon. The real weapon is the staff's hidden sword (Evidence 9). Therefore, the testimony about the stabbing with the Shichishito contradicts the evidence that it's not the actual murder weapon. 

So the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (which claims the stabbing was done with the Shichishito) and Evidence 10 (which says Shichishito isn't the real weapon). That should be the pair.

{"evidence": 10, "testimony": 3}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. I need to go through each testimony and check against the evidence provided.

Looking at Testimony 6 from Iris: "By the time the murder took place, the snow had already stopped." The murder's time is between 10 PM and 11 PM according to the autopsy report (Evidence 11). Now, checking the Weather Data (Evidence 7), it says snow was from 7 PM to around 10:50 PM. So the snow stopped around 10:50 PM. But the murder happened between 10 and 11 PM. If Iris says the snow had already stopped when the murder took place, but according to the weather data, the snow stopped around 10:50. So if the murder was exactly at 10:45 PM when the lightning struck (as per Evidence 7), then the snow was still falling until 10:50. Wait, the timeline here might conflict. If the murder happened during the snow period, but Iris claims the snow had already stopped, that's a contradiction. So Evidence 7 (Weather Data) contradicts Testimony 6.

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 6}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence contradicts which testimony. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies, and I need to find a pair where the evidence directly contradicts the testimony.

First, I'll look through the testimonies. Let's start with Maya's testimonies. Testimony 4 says she saw a man behind her attacker by the light of the stone lantern. The key point here is the stone lantern providing light. But looking at the evidence, Evidence 20 is the Stone Lantern, and its description states that it was not lit the night of the crime. If the lantern wasn't lit, Maya couldn't have seen the man by its light. That's a contradiction. So Evidence 20 contradicts Testimony 4.

{"evidence": 20, "testimony": 4}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. The user wants me to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The characters, evidences, and testimonies are all from a game, probably Ace Attorney based on the names.

First, I need to look at each testimony and see if any of the evidence directly contradicts what's being said. Let's go through the testimonies one by one.

Testimony 0 is Maya saying she woke up on the Training Hall floor. Not sure which evidence would contradict that yet.

Testimony 1: Maya mentions coming back to the garden and it had changed. Maybe the Crime Photo (13) or Tracks Photo (14) could show something, but not sure.

Testimony 2: She thinks the killer cleaned up evidence for her sake. The Burnt Letter (18) from Morgan might have orders, but not directly contradicting.

Testimony 3: The torches were lit and the body was gone. Wait, the autopsy report (11) says the body fell 10 ft after death. If the body was moved, maybe that's related. But the Crime Photo (13) shows the courtyard where the murder happened. Hmm, but if the body was gone, but the photo shows the crime scene, maybe that's a contradiction. Or maybe the photo was taken after the body was moved?

Wait, Testimony 3 says the body was gone when she came back, but the autopsy report (11) mentions the body fell after death. Wait, maybe if the body was found in a different location. For example, the autopsy says the body fell 10 ft, implying maybe from a height. But the crime photo shows the courtyard. If the body was moved, but the autopsy report's details about the fall would indicate it was in a different place than where the body was found. But this might not directly contradict the testimony.

Testimony 4: All snow around the stone lantern was cleaned up. The Stone Lantern (20) evidence says it wasn't lit that night. If the snow was cleaned, maybe there's a sign of that. But the stone lantern not being lit might not directly contradict unless the cleaning would require light or something. Not sure yet.

Testimony 5: Maya assumed the killer was a man because they did all the work alone. But maybe some evidence suggests a woman could do it, or that someone had help. But looking at the evidence list, maybe the Weather Data (7) says there was lightning, which could have caused the bridge to collapse. Larry's Sketch (15) shows a silhouette gliding over the bridge. If the bridge was on fire and someone glided over, maybe a woman could do that, but how does that contradict the testimony?

Wait, the Weather Data (7) mentions lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM. The tracks photo (14) shows tracks from Main Gate to Dusky Bridge. The Crystal Sphere (16) was found near the bridge with blood, which came from the staff. The victim's staff (9) has a hidden sword. The Shichishito (10) was the apparent murder weapon but isn't the actual one. The autopsy report (11) says the time of death was between 10-11 PM, cause is a stab in the back. The victim's body fell 10 ft after death. So the body was moved after death.

Now, looking at Testimony 3: "The torches were lit... And the body was gone." If the torches were lit, but the Stone Lantern (20) was not lit that night. Wait, the Stone Lantern is in the Inner Temple garden. But Testimony 3 mentions torches, maybe in the garden. If the stone lantern wasn't lit, but torches were, maybe that's a contradiction. But the Stone Lantern is separate from the torches. Alternatively, maybe the Stone Lantern being unlit contradicts something else.

Wait, Testimony 4 says the snow around the stone lantern was cleaned up. The Stone Lantern (20) evidence says it wasn't lit. If the snow was cleaned up, maybe someone tried to hide something. But how does that contradict testimony?

Alternatively, let's look at Testimony 3 again: "The torches were lit... And the body was gone." But according to the Autopsy Report (11), the body fell 10 ft after death, meaning it was moved. If the body was moved, then maybe the torches being lit would indicate the area was lit, making it hard to move the body without being seen. But perhaps the contradiction is elsewhere.

Wait, the Weather Data (7) says there was lightning around 10:45 PM. Larry's Sketch (15) shows a bridge on fire with two draw strings and a silhouette gliding over. The bridge fire might have been caused by the lightning. The Crystal Sphere (16) was found near the bridge with blood, which came from the staff. The victim's staff (9) has a hidden sword, which is the actual murder weapon, but the Shichishito (10) was the apparent weapon with fingerprints but not the real one. 

So, the actual murder weapon is the staff's hidden sword. The Shichishito was planted. If the staff was used, then the killer had access to it. But Elise Deauxnim had the staff with her fingerprints. So maybe someone else used her staff to kill her. But how does this tie into the testimonies?

Looking back at Testimony 3: Maya says the body was gone when she came back. The autopsy report says the body fell 10 ft after death, which suggests the body was moved. But the Crime Photo (13) shows the courtyard where the murder happened. If the body was moved, but the photo is of the courtyard, maybe the photo contradicts the testimony about the body being gone. But maybe the photo was taken after the body was moved back. Not sure.

Alternatively, Testimony 4 says the snow around the stone lantern was cleaned. The Stone Lantern (20) wasn't lit. But if the snow was cleaned, maybe someone tried to hide footprints. However, the tracks photo (14) shows tracks from Main Gate to Dusky Bridge, so maybe those tracks are still there. If the snow around the lantern was cleaned, but the tracks remained, that's possible. Not a direct contradiction.

Wait, Testimony 5: Maya assumed the killer was a man because they worked alone. But maybe some evidence shows that the work could have been done by a woman. For example, if the killer used the staff's hidden sword, which is lighter, or if the killer had help from someone else. But the testimony is about assuming gender based on working alone, not about possibility. Maybe the evidence that the killer had an accomplice? The Burnt Letter (18) from Morgan Fey might indicate a conspiracy, but not sure.

Alternatively, the Magatama (1) could detect secrets, but that's a gameplay mechanic. Not sure.

Wait, let's think about Testimony 3 and the Autopsy Report. If the body was found in the courtyard (Crime Photo 13), but the autopsy says it fell 10 ft after death, that suggests the body was moved from a higher place. The bridge? If the body was moved from the bridge to the courtyard, then Maya's testimony about the body being gone would mean she saw it in a different location. But if the body was moved, maybe the Crime Photo contradicts her testimony that the body was gone when she came back. Or perhaps the time frame: the murder happened between 10-11 PM. The lightning struck the bridge at 10:45, which is when the fire started. If the body was moved after death, which happened around 10-11, maybe the fire on the bridge (Larry's Sketch 15) is related. 

Alternatively, the Hanging Scroll (4) has Misty Fey's image obscured by gravy. Godot's comment about Western tastes. Not sure how that ties in.

Wait, let's look at Testimony 3: "The torches were lit... And the body was gone." If the torches were lit, that would provide light. But the Stone Lantern (20) wasn't lit. Maybe the torches and the lantern are different. But if the torches were lit, maybe the area was illuminated. But the weather data mentions snow until 10:50 PM and lightning until 11 PM. The murder was at 10-11 PM. If the torches were lit, maybe that's during the time when the snow had stopped, but the lightning was ongoing. Not sure.

Alternatively, the Shichishito (10) is the apparent weapon with the suspect's fingerprints, but the actual weapon is the staff's sword (9). If the suspect's prints are on the Shichishito, but that's not the murder weapon, then the real killer could have planted it. So Testimony 5's assumption that the killer was a man because they worked alone might be contradicted if the real killer is a woman who framed someone else. For example, if the Shichishito has a man's prints, but the real killer is a woman (like Iris or Morgan), then Maya's assumption would be wrong. But how does the evidence directly contradict the testimony?

Wait, Testimony 5 says Maya assumed the killer was a man because they did all the work alone. But if the evidence shows that the killer couldn't have acted alone, then that's a contradiction. For example, if the crime required two people, but the testimony says the killer worked alone. Looking at the evidence, the Burnt Letter (18) from Morgan Fey could indicate she ordered someone to do it, implying an accomplice. But Testimony 5 is about the assumption of gender based on working alone, not the number of people. Hmm.

Alternatively, the tracks in the snow (Evidence 14) show movement from Main Gate to Dusky Bridge. If the killer had to move between these places, maybe the time frame makes it impossible for one person, but the testimony assumes one person. But how does that directly contradict?

Wait, let's think about the timing. The murder happened between 10-11 PM. The snow stopped around 10:50 PM. The lightning was until 11 PM. The fire on Dusky Bridge started at 10:45 and lasted 30 minutes. So the bridge was on fire from 10:45 to around 11:15. The body was moved after death (autopsy says fell 10 ft). If the body was moved from the bridge to the courtyard, then during the fire, moving the body would be difficult. Maybe the killer needed help, contradicting Testimony 5's assumption of a single person. But the evidence would need to show that.

Alternatively, the Crystal Sphere (16) was found near the bridge with blood from the staff. The staff's sword is the real weapon. If the murder happened near the bridge, but the body was moved to the courtyard, then the killer had to move the body. But the tracks photo shows tracks from Main Gate to Dusky Bridge. If the killer had to go from the bridge to the courtyard, maybe the tracks would show that. But I'm not sure.

Wait, Testimony 3 says the body was gone when Maya came back. If the body was moved, but the Crime Photo (13) shows the body in the courtyard, then maybe the photo was taken after the body was moved back. But that's a stretch. Alternatively, the autopsy report says the body fell 10 ft after death, implying it was moved from a higher place. The bridge is a suspension bridge, maybe high up. If the body was pushed off the bridge (fell 10 ft), then the body would be in the ravine below. But the Crime Photo shows the courtyard. So there's a contradiction here. The autopsy says the body fell 10 ft after death, but the Crime Photo shows the body in the courtyard. That would mean the body was moved twice: once from the bridge to the ravine (falling 10 ft), then to the courtyard. But that's complicated. How does that contradict the testimony?

Alternatively, Testimony 3 says the body was gone, but the autopsy report and crime photo show the body was found in the courtyard. So if Maya came back and the body was gone, but the body was actually found there, that's a contradiction. But maybe the timeline is different. Wait, the murder happened between 10-11 PM. Maya's testimony about the body being gone would be after she came back, which might be after the murder. But the crime photo shows the body in the courtyard, so if the body was there when the photo was taken, but Maya says it was gone, that's a contradiction. But when was the photo taken? If the photo was taken the next morning, then maybe the body was moved back. But the evidence description for the Crime Photo (13) says it's the courtyard where the murder happened. So if the body was moved, but the photo shows it there, that's conflicting with Maya's testimony that it was gone when she returned.

So Evidence 13 (Crime Photo) shows the body in the courtyard, but Testimony 3 says the body was gone when Maya returned. That's a contradiction. Therefore, the pair would be {"evidence": 13, "testimony": 3}.

Wait, but let me check the evidence again. Evidence 13 is the Crime Photo: "The courtyard where Elise Deauxnim was murdered. Click here for details." So the photo shows the crime scene, implying the body is there. But Maya's Testimony 3 says when she came back, the body was gone. So if the photo shows the body in the courtyard, but Maya says it was gone, that's a contradiction. Therefore, the evidence 13 contradicts testimony 3.

{"evidence": 13, "testimony": 3}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is asking which evidence and testimony contradict each other. So I need to look at all the testimonies and see if any of them are contradicted by one of the evidences.

First, let's go through the testimonies. Testimony 3 from Maya says: "That's when Mr. Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time!" So according to her, Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time when the bridge was fixed the next day. But I need to check the evidence to see if there's something that contradicts this.

Looking at the evidence list, let's see. Evidence 4 is the Hanging Scroll, which mentions Godot described Misty Fey's image. Evidence 7 is the Weather Data, which mentions lightning striking Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM. Evidence 15 is Larry's Sketch, showing the bridge on fire and a silhouette. Evidence 16 is the Crystal Sphere found near the bridge with blood. But I'm not sure yet.

Wait, maybe the key is in the timing. The testimonies from Maya mention that Godot arrived at the Inner Temple the next day when the bridge was fixed. But perhaps there's evidence that Godot was already on the Inner Temple side before that. Let's look at Evidence 3, the Hazakura Temple Map. Hmm, not sure. Evidence 7's Weather Data says the lightning struck the bridge at 10:45 PM, which was the night of the crime. If the bridge was destroyed then, how did Godot get to the Inner Temple the next day after it was fixed? But Testimony 3 says he arrived for the first time then. But maybe there's evidence that he was already there earlier.

Wait, let me check Evidence 4 again. The Hanging Scroll's description says that Godot described Misty Fey as 'clad in her stunning Japanese garb surrounded by the hue and aroma of Western tastes'. To have that description, maybe Godot had seen the Hanging Scroll before the incident. But the Hanging Scroll was in the temple, perhaps in the Inner Temple. If the bridge was out due to the fire from the lightning strike, then how did Godot get there before the bridge was fixed unless he was already on that side. Wait, but according to the Weather Data, the bridge was struck by lightning at 10:45 PM. The bridge would have been damaged, so maybe the bridge was impassable after that. Then the next day, after the bridge was fixed, Godot arrived. But if Godot was at the Inner Temple the next day, but the Hanging Scroll was there, maybe he had seen it before. Alternatively, maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.

Wait, Testimony 3 says Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time when the bridge was fixed the next day. But maybe there's evidence showing that Godot was already on the Inner Temple side during the crime. For example, maybe the Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16) was found near Dusky Bridge, which connects the two sides. If Godot was on the Inner Temple side during the crime, but the bridge was destroyed by lightning at 10:45, he couldn't have crossed back. But according to Testimony 3, he arrived the next day. However, if there's evidence that he was there earlier, that would contradict.

Alternatively, let's look at the map (Evidence 3). The temple has areas connected by the bridge. If the bridge was out, someone couldn't cross. But maybe there's another way. Hmm. Alternatively, looking at Larry's Sketch (Evidence 15), which shows a silhouette gliding over the bridge. That might be someone using the drawstrings. But how does that relate to Godot?

Wait, the Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16) is part of the victim's staff (Evidence 9). The staff had a sword inside, and the Crystal Sphere came from it. If the sphere was found near the bridge, maybe someone had used the staff there. If Godot was on the Inner Temple side during the crime, then he couldn't have crossed after the bridge was struck unless he was already there. But Testimony 3 says he arrived the next day. So if there's evidence placing him there earlier, that would contradict.

Alternatively, maybe the burnt letter (Evidence 18) from Morgan Fey. But how does that tie in?

Wait, another angle: Maya's Testimony 3 says Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time the next day. But if there's evidence that Godot was in the Inner Temple earlier, like on the night of the crime, that would contradict. For example, the Hanging Scroll's description by Godot would require him to have seen it. If the Hanging Scroll is in the Inner Temple, then he must have been there before. But according to the testimony, he arrived the next day. So that's a contradiction. Evidence 4's Hanging Scroll has Godot's description of Misty Fey, implying he saw the scroll, which is in the Inner Temple. But if he only arrived the next day, how could he have described it before? Unless he saw it earlier.

Therefore, Evidence 4 (Hanging Scroll) contradicts Testimony 3 (Godot arrived for the first time the next day), because if he described the Hanging Scroll's image, he must have been there earlier to see it. So that would be the contradiction. Hence, the pair would be evidence 4 and testimony 3.

{"evidence": 4, "testimony": 3}
====================================================================================================

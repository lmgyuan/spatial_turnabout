Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants only one pair. Let me start by going through the testimonies and see if any of them clash with the evidence provided.

Looking at the testimonies first. Testimony 0 to 5 are all from Iris. Testimony 0 says she went to the Inner Temple and saw everything happen in the garden. Then Testimony 1 claims she saw Elise strike Maya with her staff. Testimony 2 says Elise moved in to deliver a fatal strike while Maya was stumbling. Testimony 3 mentions Elise threw her staff away and pulled a dagger. Testimony 4 says Maya tried to defend herself and stole the weapon. Testimony 5 states it was self-defense.

Now, checking the evidences. Let's look at evidence related to the murder weapon. Evidence 10 is the Shichishito, which is noted as the apparent murder weapon with the victim's blood and suspect's fingerprints, but it says it's not the actual murder weapon. Wait, that's confusing. Also, Evidence 9 is the victim's staff, which has a hidden sword inside. Evidence 19 is a dagger found in the garden with blood that doesn't match the victim.

So, Iris's testimony says Elise used her staff (Testimony 1) and then a dagger (Testimony 3). But the autopsy report (Evidence 11) says the cause of death was a stab in the back leading to blood loss. The Shichishito (Evidence 10) had blood and fingerprints but isn't the real weapon. However, the staff (Evidence 9) has a hidden sword. Wait, the staff's sword might be the actual weapon. But according to Iris's testimony, the dagger was used. However, the dagger found (Evidence 19) has blood that doesn't match the victim, so maybe the real murder weapon was the sword inside the staff. If the victim was stabbed with the sword from the staff, then the testimony about using a dagger would be wrong. 

Testimony 3 says Elise pulled a dagger from her robe. But Evidence 19's dagger doesn't match the victim's blood, so that dagger wasn't the murder weapon. The real weapon could be the staff's hidden sword. So Iris's testimony about the dagger being used contradicts Evidence 19, which shows the dagger's blood isn't the victim's. Therefore, if the autopsy says the victim died from a stab wound, but the dagger found didn't have her blood, then Iris's claim that the dagger was used in the attack (Testimony 3) is contradicted by Evidence 19. Also, maybe the staff's sword is the actual weapon. So the contradiction here would be Testimony 3 (using a dagger) vs Evidence 19 (blood doesn't match). Alternatively, perhaps the Shichishito (Evidence 10) is claimed to have the victim's blood, but the autopsy says the cause was a stab from the back. Wait, Evidence 10 says "Had the victim's blood and the suspect's fingerprints on it, but is not the murder weapon." That's confusing. So even though it has the blood, it's not the actual murder weapon. So maybe the real murder weapon is the staff's hidden sword (Evidence 9), which would mean the injury was from that. But Iris says the dagger was used. So Testimony 3 (Elise using a dagger) contradicts the fact that the dagger found (Evidence 19) has blood not matching the victim. Therefore, the murder couldn't have been done with that dagger. Hence, Iris's testimony about the dagger is contradicted by the evidence about the dagger's blood. So the pair would be Testimony 3 and Evidence 19. Let me check the numbers. Testimony 3 is from Iris, and Evidence 19 is the dagger with non-matching blood. So the contradiction is between Iris's Testimony 3 (using a dagger from the robe) and Evidence 19 (dagger's blood isn't the victim's). Therefore, the correct answer is Evidence 19 and Testimony 3.

{"evidence": 19, "testimony": 3}
Okay, let's start by going through the problem step by step. The task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. The answer must be in the form of a JSON object with the evidence number and testimony number.

First, I'll need to look at each testimony and see if any of the evidence directly contradicts what's being claimed. Let's list out the testimonies provided:

Testimony 0: Iris says Maya was hit over the head with the staff.
Testimony 1: Iris claims Maya dodged Elise's next attack and stole her weapon.
Testimony 2: Elise was on the defensive with her back to the stone lantern.
Testimony 3: Maya stabbed Elise.
Testimony 4: Elise flung the knife away and collapsed.

Now, looking at the evidence list, some key points to note:

Evidence 9 (Victim's Staff) mentions that the staff has Elise's fingerprints and a hidden sword. Also, it says that only Detective Gumshoe and the user know about the hidden sword. So, if the staff was used to hit Maya, perhaps that's relevant.

Evidence 10 (Shichishito) is stated to be the apparent murder weapon with victim's blood and suspect's fingerprints, but it's clarified that it's not the actual murder weapon. So, if the testimony says Maya used the Shichishito to stab Elise, but the evidence says it's not the murder weapon, that could be a contradiction.

Wait, Testimony 3 says Maya stabbed Elise with the Shichishito (assuming that's the weapon). But Evidence 10 states that the Shichishito isn't the murder weapon. So that would contradict the testimony. But let me check the details again.

Testimony 3 specifically says "That's when Mystic Maya stabbed Mystic Elise!" According to Iris's testimony, the murder weapon is the Shichishito (Evidence 10) because it has the victim's blood and suspect's fingerprints. However, Evidence 10 explicitly states that it's not the actual murder weapon. Therefore, the testimony claiming that Maya used the Shichishito to stab Elise contradicts the evidence which says that the Shichishito is not the murder weapon. Hence, Testimony 3 (which implicates the Shichishito as the weapon) contradicts Evidence 10's statement that it's not the murder weapon.

Another angle: The autopsy report (Evidence 11) says the cause of death was a stab in the back. The Shichishito is the apparent weapon, but the real murder weapon might be the dagger (Evidence 19) which was found with blood that doesn't match the victim's. Wait, but the staff (Evidence 9) has a hidden sword. If the staff's sword was the actual weapon, that could be another contradiction. But according to the staff's description, the hidden sword's existence is known only to Gumshoe and the user. If the staff's sword was used, then Iris's testimony about the Shichishito being the weapon would be incorrect.

Alternatively, the Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16) has blood on it and came from the victim's staff. If the staff was used to hit Maya (Testimony 0), perhaps the sphere is related. But I'm not sure how that ties into the contradiction.

Wait, the Shichishito (Evidence 10) has the victim's blood but isn't the murder weapon. So the real weapon is something else. Testimony 3 says Maya used the Shichishito, but the evidence says it's not the murder weapon. Therefore, Testimony 3 is contradicted by Evidence 10.

Yes, that seems to be the direct contradiction. The testimony claims the stabbing was done with the Shichishito (since it's the one with fingerprints and blood), but the evidence states it's not the actual murder weapon. Therefore, the real murder weapon must be different. So the contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 10.

{"evidence": 10, "testimony": 3}
Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants just one pair, and I have to output it in JSON at the end. Let's start by looking at the testimonies and evidences provided.

First, the characters and evidence. The key here is to cross-reference each testimony with the evidence to spot inconsistencies. Let's go through the testimonies one by one and see if any evidence directly contradicts them.

Looking at Testimony 6 from Iris: She says, "By the time the murder took place, the snow had already stopped." The murder time is between 10-11 PM according to the autopsy report (Evidence 11). Now, looking at the Weather Data (Evidence 7), it says that snow was from 7 PM to approximately 10:50 PM. So if the murder happened between 10 and 11 PM, the snow stopped around 10:50. But Iris claims that when the murder took place, the snow had already stopped. However, the murder occurred at the time of death, which is between 10-11 PM. If the snow stopped at 10:50, then any part of the murder happening before 10:50 would have snow, and after 10:50, no snow. But since the murder's exact time isn't pinpointed beyond the 10-11 PM window, there's a potential contradiction here. If Iris is saying that during the murder (i.e., the time of the stabbing), the snow had already stopped, but according to the weather data, the snow stopped around 10:50. So if the murder happened at, say, 10:45 PM, it was still snowing. But if it happened after 10:50, then the snow had stopped. However, the lightning was from 10 to 11 PM, with a strike at 10:45 on Dusky Bridge. The autopsy says the body fell 10 ft after death, which might relate to the bridge collapse due to lightning. But Iris's testimony about the snow stopping before the murder might conflict with the weather data's timeline.

Wait, the murder's time of death is between 10-11 PM. So the actual stabbing happened during that hour. If the snow stopped at 10:50, then if the murder happened after 10:50, the snow had stopped. But if it happened before 10:50, it was still snowing. Iris's Testimony 6 says that during the murder, the snow had already stopped. But according to the weather data, the snow was ongoing until about 10:50. So if the murder occurred before 10:50, then the snow was still falling, contradicting Iris's statement. However, the exact time of death isn't specified beyond the 10-11 window. The lightning strike at 10:45 might have caused the bridge to collapse, which is when Phoenix fell. But the murder's timing could be either before or after 10:50.

Wait, the fire from the lightning strike on Dusky Bridge at 10:45. The weather data mentions that around 30 minutes passed between the fire starting and going out. So if the fire started at 10:45, then it went out around 11:15. But the murder's time of death is 10-11 PM, so the murder must have happened before 11 PM. Therefore, the snow stopped at 10:50, so the murder could have happened between 10:50 and 11 PM, which would align with Iris's testimony. But if the murder happened before 10:50, her statement is false. However, the murder's time is within 10-11 PM. Unless there's more precise timing, maybe the contradiction is that Iris claims the snow had already stopped when the murder took place, but according to the weather data, the snow was still ongoing until 10:50. So if the murder occurred during the time when snow was still falling, her testimony is contradicted.

Alternatively, the key contradiction might be between Testimony 3 and some evidence. Testimony 3: "I dragged it behind me all the way across Dusky Bridge." But according to the weather data, there was a lightning strike at 10:45 PM that hit Dusky Bridge. If Iris dragged the body across the bridge after the murder, which happened between 10-11 PM, but the bridge was struck by lightning and possibly destroyed at 10:45, then dragging the body across after that time would be impossible. But the murder time is up to 11 PM. If Iris moved the body after the bridge was destroyed, that's a problem. Let's check the evidence. Evidence 14: Tracks Photo shows tracks from Main Gate to Dusky Bridge. If the bridge was destroyed at 10:45, how could she drag the body across after that? The autopsy says the body fell 10 ft after death, which might be due to the bridge collapsing. So if the murder happened before 10:45, the bridge was intact, and then the lightning struck, causing the bridge to collapse. But Iris would have dragged the body across after the murder. If the bridge was already destroyed, she couldn't have done that. So Testimony 3 says she dragged the body across Dusky Bridge, but if the bridge was destroyed by lightning at 10:45, and the murder happened at 10 PM (assuming Iris's Testimony 6 that snow had stopped, which ended at 10:50), then the timeline is conflicting.

Wait, maybe the key contradiction is between Iris's Testimony 6 (snow had stopped during the murder) and the Weather Data (Evidence 7) which says snow was until 10:50. So if the murder occurred during the time when snow was still falling (before 10:50), her testimony is a lie. However, the murder's time of death is between 10-11 PM. So if the actual murder was at, say, 10:55 PM, then the snow had stopped, and her testimony is correct. But if the murder was at 10:45 PM, snow was still falling, making her statement false. But since the time of death is a range, how can we know? Maybe other evidence. The body fell 10 ft after death, which could be due to the bridge collapse from the lightning at 10:45. If the victim was killed before 10:45, then the bridge collapse caused the body to fall. So the murder time would be before 10:45, meaning snow was still falling (since snow stopped at 10:50). Therefore, Iris's Testimony 6 that the snow had already stopped during the murder would be a lie, contradicting the weather data. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 6 (Iris) and Evidence 7 (Weather Data).

Alternatively, Testimony 3 (Iris dragged the body across Dusky Bridge) and the fact that Dusky Bridge was struck by lightning at 10:45, causing a fire that lasted 30 minutes (until 11:15). If the bridge was on fire or destroyed after 10:45, then dragging the body across after that time would be impossible. But when did Iris move the body? If the murder occurred at 10 PM, she could have moved it before the lightning strike. But according to the autopsy, the body fell 10 ft after death, which might be after the bridge collapse. So if the body was moved across the bridge after it was destroyed, that's impossible. So Testimony 3 (dragged across Dusky Bridge) would contradict the bridge being destroyed. But when was the bridge destroyed? The lightning strike at 10:45 caused the fire, which took 30 minutes to go out. So the bridge might have been impassable after 10:45. If Iris moved the body after the murder (which happened between 10-11 PM), and if the murder happened after 10:45, then moving the body across the bridge would be impossible. However, if the murder happened before 10:45, then the bridge was intact, and she could have moved it. But according to Testimony 6, she claims the snow had stopped during the murder, which would only be true if the murder was after 10:50. So there's a contradiction here: if the murder was after 10:50 (snow stopped), then the bridge was struck by lightning at 10:45, which is before the murder. Wait, that can't be. The lightning struck the bridge at 10:45, which would be before the murder if the murder happened after 10:45. So that's impossible. Therefore, the murder must have occurred before the lightning strike. Wait, but the autopsy says the time of death is between 10-11 PM. The lightning strike at 10:45 is within that window. So perhaps the victim was killed before the bridge was struck. Then, the bridge was destroyed, but Iris claims to have dragged the body across it. That would be impossible if the bridge was destroyed. Therefore, Testimony 3 contradicts the fact that the bridge was struck by lightning and possibly destroyed. But the evidence (Evidence 7) says the lightning struck the bridge at 10:45, and the fire lasted 30 minutes. The bridge's condition after the strike isn't explicitly stated, but the photo (Evidence 21) taken the next morning shows the aftermath. If the bridge was destroyed, then Testimony 3 about dragging the body across it would be impossible if done after the lightning strike. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 7 (the lightning strike time). But how? Let me think again.

Alternatively, let's check the weather data. The snow stopped around 10:50. If Iris's Testimony 6 says that during the murder, the snow had already stopped, but the murder happened between 10 and 11 PM. If the murder occurred before 10:50, then it was still snowing, which contradicts her testimony. So if the murder happened at, say, 10:45 (when the lightning struck), then snow was still ongoing (since it stopped at 10:50), making her Testimony 6 false. Therefore, the contradiction would be between Testimony 6 (Iris) and Evidence 7 (Weather Data). That seems plausible.

Another angle: Testimony 6 says snow had stopped during the murder. Evidence 7 states snow stopped around 10:50. If the murder happened at 10:50 or later, her statement is true. But the murder's time is between 10-11 PM. If the murder happened at 10:50 or after, the snow had stopped, but if before, it was still snowing. However, the key point is that Iris's testimony claims the snow had already stopped when the murder took place. But the weather data shows that snow was still falling until 10:50. Therefore, if the murder occurred before 10:50, her statement is false. However, the exact time of the murder isn't specified. But the victim's body fell 10 ft after death (from the autopsy), which could be due to the bridge collapse caused by the lightning strike at 10:45. So if the murder occurred before the lightning strike (say, 10:44), then the bridge collapse (10:45) caused the body to fall. In that case, the snow was still falling (until 10:50), so Iris's Testimony 6 would be false. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 6 and Evidence 7.

So the correct pair would be evidence 7 (Weather Data) and testimony 6 (Iris's statement about snow stopping during the murder). That's the contradiction.

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 6}
Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. There's a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies provided.

First, I need to go through each testimony and see if any of the evidence directly contradicts it. The user wants only one pair, so I need to look for the most obvious contradiction.

Looking at the testimonies, they're all from Maya. Testimony 4 says she saw a man behind her attacker by the light of the stone lantern. But in the evidence list, Evidence 20 is the Stone Lantern, which states it was not lit the night of the crime. If the lantern wasn't lit, Maya couldn't have seen anything by its light. That seems like a contradiction. So the testimony claims she saw someone using the lantern's light, but the evidence says the lantern wasn't lit. That must be the contradiction they're looking for.

{"evidence": 20, "testimony": 4}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants one pair. Let me start by reviewing the provided information.

First, let's look at the testimonies from Maya. Testimony 3 says, "The torches were lit... And the body was gone." Testimony 4 mentions that all the snow around the stone lantern was cleaned up. Testimony 5 suggests the person did the work alone, so Maya assumed it was a man.

Now, the evidence. Let's check the weather data (Evidence 7). It mentions that there was snow from 7 PM to about 10:50 PM, and lightning from 10 PM to 11 PM. The snow stopped around 10:50 PM. The crime happened that night. 

Maya's Testimony 4 says the snow around the stone lantern was cleaned up. But according to the weather data, snow was falling until around 10:50 PM. If the snow was cleaned up after the snow stopped, that's possible. But if the cleanup happened during the snowing, any new snow would cover the cleaned area again. However, the murder's timing is between 10 and 11 PM. The body was found after the snow stopped? Wait, the autopsy report (Evidence 11) says the time of death was between 10-11 PM. The fire started and went out around 30 minutes, which would be after 10:45 PM (when lightning struck the bridge). 

If the killer cleaned up the snow around the stone lantern during the time when it was still snowing (before 10:50 PM), then the cleaned area would be covered again by snow. But Maya's testimony says the snow was cleaned up. That would be a contradiction because the snow would have covered any cleaned-up areas if the cleanup happened while it was still snowing. However, the weather data shows that snow stopped around 10:50 PM. If the cleanup happened after that, maybe it's possible. But the murder happened around 10 PM to 11 PM. The body was moved, and the cleanup would need to be after the snow stopped. Wait, the timeline might be tight here. Let me check the timing again.

The snow stopped around 10:50 PM. The lightning was until 11 PM. The fire started after the lightning struck the bridge at 10:45 PM. The fire lasted about 30 minutes, so until around 11:15 PM. The body was moved after death (from the autopsy report, the body fell 10 ft. after death). If the killer cleaned up the snow after 10:50 PM, then the snow had stopped, so the cleaned area wouldn't be covered. So Testimony 4 says the snow around the lantern was cleaned up. If the snow stopped at 10:50, and the cleanup happened after that, then it's possible. But maybe there's another angle.

Wait, the Stone Lantern (Evidence 20) was not lit that night. But if the torches were lit (Testimony 3), that's part of the garden setup. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe the tracks photo (Evidence 14) shows tracks from Main Gate to Dusky Bridge. But how does that relate?

Wait, Testimony 4 says the snow around the stone lantern was cleaned up. If the snow had already stopped, then the area could be cleaned without new snow covering it. But if the cleanup happened while it was still snowing, then the cleaned area would have fresh snow. So if the cleanup was done before the snow stopped, that would leave no trace. But Maya says the snow was cleaned up, implying that the area was clear. If the snow was still falling, the area would get covered again. So, the contradiction here is that the weather data says snow stopped at 10:50 PM. If the cleanup happened after 10:50, it's possible. But if the crime occurred during the snowing period, the cleanup would have to happen after the snow stopped. But the murder happened at 10 PM, so maybe the cleanup was done after 10:50. However, the contradiction would be if the cleanup required no snow, but the snow was still falling. Wait, maybe the testimony says the snow was cleaned up, but the weather data shows that it was snowing until 10:50. So if the cleanup was done before 10:50, the snow would cover it again, making the cleanup impossible. Therefore, Testimony 4 (snow cleaned up) contradicts Evidence 7 (snow until 10:50). So if the cleanup happened during the time when snow was still falling, the area would be covered again. Therefore, the testimony that the snow was cleaned up despite the ongoing snowfall would be a contradiction. But the murder's timing is between 10-11 PM. The snow stopped at 10:50. So if the cleanup happened after 10:50, then it's possible. But the body was moved after death, and the fire started at 10:45 (lightning strike). The fire lasted 30 minutes, so until 11:15. The body's movement would have to be after death (between 10-11 PM), so perhaps the cleanup was after 10:50. Therefore, the contradiction is if the cleanup happened during the snow, but the testimony says it was cleaned. Alternatively, maybe the tracks in the snow. The Tracks Photo (Evidence 14) shows tracks from Main Gate to Dusky Bridge, but if the snow was still falling, those tracks would be covered unless made after the snow stopped. But the tracks photo's timing isn't clear. Hmm. Alternatively, Testimony 5: Maya assumed it was a man because the work was done alone. But perhaps the evidence that shows the staff (Evidence 9) has a sword hidden, which might require strength, but that's not a direct contradiction. Or the dagger (Evidence 19) with blood not matching the victim's. Not sure. Let me go back to Testimony 4 and Evidence 7. If the snow was cleaned up (Testimony 4) but it was snowing until 10:50, then unless the cleanup happened after 10:50, the snow would have covered it. However, the murder occurred between 10-11 PM. If the cleanup was part of the crime, then the killer would have to do it after the snow stopped. But if the snow stopped at 10:50, and the murder was at 10 PM, then there's a 50-minute window where the killer could have cleaned up after 10:50. But the autopsy says time of death was 10-11 PM. So the killer could have committed the murder, waited until the snow stopped at 10:50, then cleaned up. But the exact timing might not be a contradiction. Alternatively, the burning letter (Evidence 18) is from Morgan Fey, but not sure. Let me check other evidences. Evidence 16: Crystal Sphere with blood, came from the victim's staff. The staff has a sword inside. The Shichishito (Evidence 10) is not the murder weapon. The real murder weapon is the dagger (maybe?) but the autopsy says stab in the back. The staff's sword could be the real weapon. But the Shichishito is the apparent weapon but isn't. Wait, the staff (Evidence 9) has a sword hidden, and the Shichishito (10) had victim's blood but is not the weapon. So maybe the real weapon is the sword inside the staff. But that's not directly related to the testimony. Back to Testimony 4 and Evidence 7. If the snow was cleaned up after 10:50, then no problem. But the problem is if the cleanup was done before 10:50, then snow would cover it. But Maya's testimony says that when she returned to the garden, the snow was cleaned up. When did she return? The timeline isn't clear. The crime photo (13) is the courtyard. Larry's sketch (15) shows the bridge on fire at the time of the crime. The fire started at 10:45 PM. So the bridge was burning around then. Maya's testimony 0 says she was on the Training Hall floor when she came to. Maybe she was unconscious during the crime. Her testimonies 3 and 4 describe the scene after she regained consciousness. If she came to after the snow stopped (10:50), then the cleaned-up snow would make sense. But if she came to before 10:50, then the snow was still falling, so the cleaned-up area would have fresh snow, which contradicts her observation. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 4 (snow cleaned up) and Evidence 7 (snow until 10:50) if the cleanup happened before 10:50. But when did Maya come to? Testimony 0: When she came to, she was lying on the Training Hall floor. The murder happened between 10-11 PM. If she came to after 10:50, then the snow had stopped, so the cleanup would be possible. But if she came to earlier, then the snow was still falling. However, there's no exact time given for when Maya regained consciousness. So maybe this is not the contradiction. Let me check other possibilities. Testimony 3 says the torches were lit, and the body was gone. The Stone Lantern (Evidence 20) was not lit. So maybe the torches being lit is a contradiction if the stone lantern wasn't, but that's not directly conflicting. Alternatively, the Hanging Scroll (4) has Misty Fey's image obscured by gravy. Godot's description mentions "clad in her stunning Japanese garb surrounded by the hue and aroma of Western tastes." Not sure how that relates. Let's consider another angle. The Shichishito (Evidence 10) is said to have the victim's blood and suspect's fingerprints, but it's not the murder weapon. The real weapon might be the dagger (19) with blood not matching the victim. But how does this relate to testimonies? Maybe Testimony 2: Maya thinks the killer cleaned up for her sake. If the real weapon is hidden, but the Shichishito was planted, that's possible, but not a direct contradiction. Testimony 12 from Iris says she was in her room from 10 PM until the murder was discovered. If there's evidence that someone saw her elsewhere, but that's not listed here. The Note to Iris (8) might be relevant, but details aren't provided. Let me check the burnt letter (18), which is from Morgan Fey. Morgan is in solitary confinement (Character 12). If the letter orders something, but Iris's Testimony (12) says she was in her room, perhaps there's a contradiction, but I don't have the content of the note or the letter. The Dagger (19) has blood not matching the victim's, but the autopsy says death was from blood loss from a stab in the back. So if the dagger isn't the weapon, but the staff's sword is, then no contradiction. Back to the original thought: Testimony 4 (snow cleaned up) and Evidence 7 (snow until 10:50). If the cleanup happened during the snowfall, the area would be covered again. But if the cleanup was after the snow stopped, it's possible. The murder time is up to 11 PM. So if the killer acted after 10:50 PM, the snow had stopped, and the cleanup would remain. Therefore, no contradiction. Hmm. Maybe another pair. Testimony 5: Maya assumed the killer was a man because the work was done alone. But if the killer was a woman, that contradicts her assumption. However, that's a subjective opinion, not a direct contradiction with evidence. Maybe Larry's Sketch (15) shows the bridge on fire with two draw strings and a silhouette. The bridge was struck by lightning at 10:45 PM (Evidence 7). The sketch could show the bridge burning, but the fire started at 10:45. However, Larry's sketch is a horrible sketch, so maybe it's accurate. Not sure. Alternatively, the Crystal Sphere (16) found near Dusky Bridge has blood and came from the victim's staff. The staff (9) had a hidden sword. If the sphere was part of the staff, then it's possible. But how does this relate to testimonies? Maybe Testimony 3 says the body was gone, but the autopsy report says the body fell 10 ft after death. If the body was moved, but the crime photo (13) shows the courtyard, maybe there's a discrepancy. But not sure. Let me think again. The key contradiction could be between Testimony 3 ("the torches were lit") and the Stone Lantern (Evidence 20: not lit that night). Wait, the Stone Lantern is separate from the torches. The torches being lit and the stone lantern not lit could be possible. So maybe that's not a contradiction. Alternatively, the Hanging Scroll (4) has Misty Fey's image covered in gravy. Godot's description mentions Western tastes. But not related to testimonies. Let me check the Magatama (Evidence 1) which detects secrets. Not sure. Let's look back. The user wants one pair. Maybe Testimony 3: "the torches were lit... And the body was gone." But the Crime Photo (13) shows the courtyard where the murder happened. If the body was gone, the photo shouldn't show it. But the Crime Photo's description just says "the courtyard where Elise was murdered" — maybe the photo was taken after the body was moved. But that's possible. Alternatively, the body was moved after death (per autopsy), so the Crime Photo might show where the body was found after falling 10 ft. Not sure. Alternatively, the Weather Data (7) says there was lightning, including at 10:45. Larry's Sketch (15) shows the bridge on fire, which aligns with the lightning strike. So no contradiction there. Hmm. I'm struggling. Let me try to approach this systematically. For each testimony, check if any evidence directly contradicts it. Testimony 4: snow around the stone lantern was cleaned up. If the snow was falling until 10:50, and the murder happened around 10 PM, then the killer would have to clean up after 10:50. If Maya saw the cleaned-up snow after 10:50, that's possible. But if the murder happened before 10:50, and the cleanup was done during snowfall, then the snow would have covered it. However, the exact timing of when Maya saw the cleaned area is unclear. If the snow had stopped, then no problem. But if she saw it during snowfall, it's a contradiction. The problem is that the testimony doesn't specify the time. But the weather data says snow stopped at 10:50. The murder was between 10-11 PM. So if the cleanup was done after 10:50, then it's possible. But if the cleanup was done before 10:50, the snow would have covered it. But Maya's testimony would be after she came to, which could be after the snow stopped. So maybe no contradiction. Wait, the fire started around 10:45 (lightning strike), and the fire lasted 30 minutes. The bridge fire would be from 10:45 to 11:15. The body was moved after death (which occurred between 10-11 PM). So the killer could have moved the body and cleaned the snow after 10:50. Therefore, Testimony 4 and Evidence 7 might not contradict. Let's check another testimony. Testimony 2: Maya thinks the killer cleaned up evidence for her sake. Evidence 18 is a burnt letter from Morgan Fey. If Morgan ordered the cleanup, then it's not for Maya's sake. But I don't know the letter's content. Alternatively, Evidence 10 (Shichishito) is not the murder weapon, but has the victim's blood. If the killer cleaned up by planting the Shichishito, but the real weapon is the staff's sword, then maybe Testimony 2 is contradicted by Evidence 10. But the testimony is about motive, not evidence. Alternatively, Testimony 12 (Iris's Testimony) says she was in her room from 10 PM. But the Note to Iris (8) was found in the Main Hall, implying she was there. However, without the note's content, it's hard to confirm. Alternatively, the Crystal Sphere (16) with blood is from the victim's staff. If the staff was broken during the crime, but the victim's staff (9) was found with her fingerprints, maybe there's a contradiction. But not directly linked to a testimony. Let me think differently. Which testimony is most likely contradicted by evidence. Let's consider Testimony 4 (snow around the lantern cleaned) and Evidence 20 (stone lantern not lit). If the lantern wasn't lit, maybe the killer needed light from the torches (Testimony 3 says torches were lit). But that's not a contradiction. Another angle: The burnt letter (18) is from Morgan, who's in jail. If the letter orders a crime, but Iris's testimony says she was in her room, but Morgan's daughter is Dahlia (Character 13) who's dead, and Iris is her twin. Maybe Iris was involved. But again, not directly contradicting testimony. Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. The most straightforward contradiction is between Testimony 4 (snow cleaned up) and Evidence 7 (snow until 10:50). If the snow was cleaned up while it was still snowing, the area would be covered again. Therefore, the only way the snow could be cleaned up without being covered is if it was done after the snow stopped. But if the murder happened before 10:50, the killer would have to wait until after 10:50 to clean up. However, the murder time is between 10-11 PM. If the cleanup was done after 10:50, then it's possible. But if the cleanup was part of the crime scene tampering during the murder (which happened before 10:50), then it's a contradiction. So the contradiction arises if the cleanup happened during the snowfall (before 10:50), making Testimony 4 impossible. But without knowing the exact time of the cleanup, it's speculative. Another possible contradiction: Testimony 3 says the torches were lit, and the body was gone. The stone lantern (20) wasn't lit. If the torches were lit, that's possible. But the Hanging Scroll (4) has Misty Fey's image with gravy, described by Godot. Not related. Maybe Testimony 5 (assumed a man did the work) and Evidence 9 (staff with hidden sword requiring strength). But that's an assumption, not a contradiction. Alternatively, the real killer is a woman, like Iris or Maya, which would contradict Testimony 5. But again, not directly evidence. Another possibility: Testimony 12 (Iris's Testimony) says she was in her room from 10 PM. But the Note to Iris (8) was found in the Main Hall, implying she was there. If the note is addressed to her and she dropped it, that would mean she was in the Main Hall after 10 PM, contradicting her testimony. But the user hasn't provided the note's content. But since the note is listed as Evidence 8, and the user includes it, perhaps that's the contradiction. However, in the given data, there's no explicit mention of the note's content. So without knowing what the note says, I can't confirm. Therefore, the most viable contradiction is Testimony 4 (snow cleaned) and Evidence 7 (snow until 10:50), assuming the cleanup happened while snow was still falling, making it impossible. Therefore, the answer is {"evidence": 7, "testimony": 4}.

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 4}
Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants just one pair, so I need to look through the provided information carefully.

First, I'll review the testimonies given by Maya. Testimony 0 says that Pearl was stuck on the Inner Temple side that night. Testimony 3 mentions that Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time the next morning when the bridge was fixed. Then Testimony 4 states that Godot found Pearl first and cheered her up. 

Now, looking at the evidence, let's check the weather data (Evidence 7). It mentions that the snow stopped around 10:50 PM, and lightning occurred until about 11 PM. The Dusky Bridge was struck by lightning at 10:45 PM, which probably caused the fire. The bridge was then out, so no one could cross until it was fixed the next day. 

If Pearl was stuck on the Inner Temple side the night of the crime (Testimony 0), and the bridge was only fixed the next morning (Testimony 2), then how did Godot get to the Inner Temple to find Pearl? According to Testimony 3 and 4, Godot arrived there the next morning after the bridge was fixed. But the bridge was out until then, so unless Godot was already on that side, he couldn't have crossed. However, the map (Evidence 3) and other info might show that the bridge was the only way. So if the bridge was down, Godot shouldn't have been able to reach the Inner Temple until it was fixed. But Testimony 3 says he arrived there for the first time that morning. Wait, but maybe he was already there? Or is there another way?

Wait, the crime happened on the night of the 7th. The bridge was struck by lightning at 10:45 PM, causing a fire. The bridge was out for 30 minutes, so the fire went out around 11:15 PM. The next day, the bridge was fixed. So, the bridge was impassable from 10:45 PM until the next morning when it was repaired. 

So, if Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time the next morning (Testimony 3), that would make sense because the bridge was fixed then. But how did he get to the Inner Temple if the bridge was the only way? Unless there's another path, but according to the map, maybe not. Wait, but Testimony 3 says he arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time when the bridge was fixed. That seems okay. However, Testimony 4 says he found Pearl there. If Pearl was stuck on the Inner Temple side since the night before, then she was there all along. But according to Testimony 2, when the bridge was fixed, Pearl was in the spare prep room. So that part seems consistent. 

Wait, maybe another angle. Let's check the other testimonies and evidences. The hanging scroll (Evidence 4) has Misty Fey's image obscured by gravy. Godot described her in a certain way. Maybe that's not directly conflicting. 

The burnt letter (Evidence 18) is from Morgan Fey. If Morgan is in solitary confinement, how did she send orders? But that's a different issue. 

Looking at Larry's Sketch (Evidence 15): a bridge on fire with two draw strings and a silhouette gliding over. The Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16) found near the bridge with blood. Maybe that's part of the murder weapon. 

Wait, the key contradiction might be between Maya's Testimony 3 and some evidence. Testimony 3 says Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time the next morning when the bridge was fixed. But if the bridge was destroyed by the fire and lightning, how could he arrive there unless he was already on that side? Alternatively, maybe Godot was on the Inner Temple side before the bridge was damaged. But according to the weather data, the snow stopped around 10:50 PM, and the lightning was until 11 PM. The bridge was struck at 10:45, causing the fire. So the bridge was out from 10:45 PM onward. If Godot arrived the next morning after the bridge was fixed, that's possible. But if there's evidence that he was already there before, that would contradict. 

Wait, the Magatama (Evidence 1) might not directly relate. The Weather Data (Evidence 7) says the bridge was struck by lightning at 10:45 PM. So the bridge was impassable after that. If Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time the next morning, that's after the bridge was fixed. So that's okay. So maybe there's a different contradiction.

Wait, looking at Testimony 3: "That's when Mr. Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time!" So according to Maya, Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time the next morning. But maybe there's evidence that he was there earlier. Let's check the evidences. 

Evidence 4: Hanging Scroll. Godot described Misty Fey's image, which was obscured by gravy. So Godot had seen the scroll before the incident. If the scroll is in the Inner Temple, then Godot must have been there prior to the next morning. Therefore, Testimony 3 claims he arrived for the first time the next morning, but Evidence 4 suggests he was there earlier to see the scroll. That's a contradiction. 

So, if Godot described the hanging scroll (Evidence 4) as being covered in gravy, then he must have seen it before the incident. But according to Testimony 3, he arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time the next morning. That would mean he couldn't have seen the scroll prior, which is a contradiction. 

Therefore, the evidence (Hanging Scroll, 4) contradicts Testimony 3 (Maya's testimony about Godot arriving first time in the morning). Because if Godot saw the scroll with the gravy description, he must have been there before the next morning. So this is the contradiction.

{"evidence": 4, "testimony": 3}

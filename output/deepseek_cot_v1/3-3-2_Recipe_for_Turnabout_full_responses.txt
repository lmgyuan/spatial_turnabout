Okay, let me try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. So, I need to go through each testimony and check if any evidence directly contradicts it.

First, looking at the testimonies provided. Testimony 3 from Gumshoe says that once they figured out the victim's identity, the investigation went smoothly. The key point here is that they quickly identified the victim. Now, checking the evidences related to the victim's identification. 

Evidence 2 is a Magazine Clipping from December 5th that mentions the user was trounced and their client found guilty. Not directly related to the victim's ID. Evidence 3 is a Sports Paper with a doodle by the victim. Wait, Evidence 3's details say the doodle is in the victim's handwriting, left by the victim on Dec 3rd. If the victim's handwriting was on that paper, but according to Testimony 2, the victim didn't have any ID. But how did they identify him quickly? If they found the sports paper with his doodle, maybe that's how they identified him. Wait, but Testimony 3 says they figured out who he was quickly. But Evidence 2 is a clipping from Dec 5th, which is after the incident on Dec 3rd. Wait, the Magazine Clipping (Evidence 2) is from Dec 5th, which is two days after the incident. So if the article talks about the user's defeat, that's after the trial maybe. Hmm.

Wait, the main contradiction might be elsewhere. Let's check Testimony 5: Gumshoe says there was nothing else missing from the crime scene. But looking at the evidences, like Evidence 17 (Victim's Prescription Bag), which was empty. The prescription bag was on the victim's table along with the lottery ticket. But if the bag is empty, maybe something was taken from it. Also, Evidence 6 (Small Bottle) which is the victim's ear medicine found in the kitchen with Furio's fingerprints. So the bottle was moved from the crime scene to the kitchen, which would mean something was missing from the original scene. Therefore, Testimony 5 claims nothing was missing, but the bottle was moved, so that's a contradiction.

Alternatively, let's look at Testimony 3: they identified the victim quickly. But Evidence 2 (Magazine Clipping) is from Dec 5th, which is after the incident (Dec 3rd). How could an article from Dec 5th be used to identify the victim on Dec 3rd? That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe not. The Magazine Clipping is about the user (Phoenix?) being trounced in court. Not directly about the victim. So maybe that's unrelated.

Wait, let me check again. Testimony 3 says "But we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly." So they identified the victim quickly. But Evidence 2 is an article from two days after the crime. So how does that relate? Maybe not directly. Let's see other possibilities.

Looking at Testimony 5: "And that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene." However, Evidence 1 is Maya's Magatama, which was recovered in the kitchen. If the Magatama was found in the kitchen, which is part of the crime scene, maybe it's not considered missing. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, Evidence 6 (Small Bottle) was found in the kitchen, which is the victim's ear medicine. The prescription bag (Evidence 17) was empty. So the victim's medicine was supposed to be in the prescription bag but was found in the kitchen. So the bottle was moved from the crime scene to the kitchen. Therefore, the crime scene was missing the bottle, which contradicts Testimony 5 that says nothing was missing. So Testimony 5 and Evidence 6 could be the contradiction.

Yes, because Testimony 5 says nothing was missing, but the Small Bottle (Evidence 6) was originally part of the victim's belongings (as per the Prescription Bag, Evidence 17) but was found in the kitchen. Therefore, it was moved from the crime scene, implying something was missing. So the testimony claims nothing was missing, but the evidence shows that the bottle was moved, hence missing from its original place. That's a contradiction.

So the pair would be Evidence 6 (Small Bottle) and Testimony 5. But wait, the question asks for one pair. Let me confirm again.

Wait, Testimony 5 is Gumshoe saying there was nothing else missing from the crime scene. But if the Small Bottle (Evidence 6) was supposed to be in the Prescription Bag (Evidence 17) on the table, but it was found in the kitchen, then the bottle was missing from the crime scene (the table) and found elsewhere. Therefore, the crime scene was missing the bottle, contradicting Testimony 5. Therefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 6 and Testimony 5.

But Evidence 6 is found in the kitchen, which is part of the crime scene? The Tr√©s Bien Floor Plans (Evidence 11) might indicate that the kitchen is part of the crime scene. If the bottle was found in the kitchen, which is part of the scene, then maybe it's not missing. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the bottle was moved from the table to the kitchen, so it's not missing but just moved. But the Prescription Bag was empty, implying the bottle should have been there. So the fact that the bottle is in the kitchen means it was moved, which would be something missing from the original location (the table). Therefore, Testimony 5's claim that nothing was missing is contradicted by the bottle not being in the Prescription Bag on the table.

So yes, Evidence 6 (Small Bottle) and Testimony 5 (Gumshoe's testimony that nothing was missing) contradict each other. Therefore, the answer should be {"evidence": 6, "testimony": 5}.

{"evidence": 6, "testimony": 5}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidence, and testimonies. Let me start by going through each testimony and see if any of them clash with the evidence.

Looking at the testimonies, they're all from Kudo (Victor Kudo). Testimony 0 says the young man (victim, Glen Elg) was reading the sports paper. Evidence 3 is the Sports Paper, which has a doodle by the victim. The doodle mentions 'MC Bomber' and '100,000' crossed out, along with some laughing face. The date is December 3rd, the day of the incident. So Testimony 0 says Glen was reading that paper, which aligns with the evidence. No contradiction here.

Testimony 1: Kudo claims the serving girl (Maggey) brought a javaccino and put something in it. Testimony 2 adds that she put white powder. Evidence 13 is the Coffee Cup with cyanide, and Evidence 16 is the Potassium Cyanide in her apron. This seems to support the testimonies, but maybe there's a contradiction elsewhere. Wait, but the problem is if there's something that contradicts this. Maybe the timing or another detail?

Testimony 5 mentions the serving girl had a ribbon in her hair and loose apron straps. Evidence 15 is the Apron, which has small pockets but big stains. If the apron straps were loose, but the apron in evidence has small pockets, not sure if that's a contradiction. Probably not directly.

Testimony 6 says Kudo didn't notice anything interesting when he saw her from the front. But if the apron had big stains or something, maybe? Not sure. Maybe not.

Looking at Testimony 2 where Kudo says Maggey put white powder in the coffee. Evidence 16 says the Potassium Cyanide was found in her apron, which has her fingerprints. But Evidence 6 is the Small Bottle, which is the victim's ear medicine, but covered in Furio Tigre's fingerprints. Wait, how does that connect?

Wait, the Coffee Cup (Evidence 13) has the victim and Maggey's fingerprints, and the poison. But according to Testimony 2, Kudo saw her put white powder. However, the Potassium Cyanide is a powdery poison. However, maybe the contradiction is that the Small Bottle (Evidence 6) has Furio's fingerprints. Wait, the Small Bottle is the victim's ear medicine. If the poison was in the coffee, then how does the ear medicine relate? Maybe the actual poison wasn't in the coffee but in the ear medicine? Or maybe the method of poisoning is different.

Wait, the Autopsy Report (Evidence 10) says cause of death is potassium cyanide poisoning. The Coffee Cup (13) had the poison. But according to the victim's Prescription Bag (17), it's empty. The victim might have needed ear medicine, but the bottle for that (Evidence 6) was found in the kitchen with Furio's fingerprints. So maybe the ear medicine was switched with poison? But how does that contradict the testimony?

Alternatively, let's look at Testimony 3: Kudo says the victim took one sip, looked in pain, collapsed. But potassium cyanide is fast-acting, so that's possible. Not sure.

Wait, let's check the Sports Paper (Evidence 3) again. The doodle says 'MC Bomber' pointing to 100k crossed out, and 'Ahahaha'. The MC Bomber is a virus (Evidence 23), created by Glen. The victim had a meeting with The Tiger (Furio Tigre) on his calendar (Evidence 20). Also, the Lunch Special (Evidence 5) is 20 dollars but tastes bad. Maybe the victim was involved with Furio, and the MC Bomber disc is connected. The victim's lottery ticket (14) is found on Maggey. Wait, maybe the real killer is Furio Tigre, not Maggey.

But how does this relate to the testimonies? Kudo's testimony says Maggey put poison in the coffee. But if the poison was in the ear medicine bottle (Evidence 6) which has Furio's fingerprints, that contradicts Kudo's testimony. Wait, if the poison was administered via the ear medicine, but Kudo claims it was put in the coffee, that's a contradiction. But the Coffee Cup does have the poison. Hmm.

Wait, the Coffee Cup has the cyanide, which is the cause of death. The Potassium Cyanide (16) is found in Maggey's apron. So the testimony that she put white powder in the coffee aligns with the evidence. However, the Small Bottle (6) is the victim's ear medicine but has Furio's prints. So maybe the actual poisoning was via the ear medicine, not the coffee? But the autopsy says coffee had the poison.

Alternatively, perhaps the testimony that Kudo saw Maggey put the powder in the coffee is contradicted by the fact that the coffee cup's handle's position. The Coffee Cup (13) description says that when facing the cup, there's a lip stain on the front and a floral handle to the right. If the victim was right-handed, the handle would be on the right, so when drinking, the lip stain would be on the front. But if the poison was in the coffee, then why is the ear medicine bottle (with Furio's prints) relevant? Maybe the poison was administered via the ear, not the coffee. Wait, potassium cyanide is usually ingested. If the coffee has the poison, then that's the method. But maybe the ear medicine was a way to get the poison into the victim's system. However, the autopsy says cause is ingestion.

Alternatively, maybe the testimony says Maggey put the powder in the coffee, but the actual poison was in the ear medicine. That would contradict. But the Coffee Cup does contain the poison. So perhaps there's another contradiction.

Looking back at Testimony 5: Kudo says Maggey had a ribbon in her hair and loose apron straps. The Apron (15) has small pockets but big stains. If the apron straps were loose, maybe the pockets were accessible. But the Potassium Cyanide was in her apron pocket. But this seems more like supporting evidence rather than contradiction.

Wait, Testimony 6 says there wasn't anything interesting when he saw her from the front. But if the apron had big stains, maybe that's something noticeable. But maybe not a direct contradiction.

Wait, let's think about the Sports Paper (Evidence 3) again. The victim left a doodle on it, which says 'MC Bomber' and '100,000' crossed out. The MC Bomber disc (23) is a virus made by the victim, worth millions. The victim's calendar (20) has a meeting with The Tiger (Furio) on the day of the incident. The Lottery Ticket (14) found on Maggey is half a million. Maybe Furio wanted the virus and the lottery ticket. But how does this tie into the testimonies?

Another angle: Victor Kudo's Note (Evidence 9) says "Convicted before, a wicked man or woman, repeat offender -- Victor Kudo". So Kudo himself might have a criminal record, making his testimony unreliable. But how does that contradict evidence?

Wait, Testimony 2 says Kudo saw Maggey put white powder in the coffee. But if the poison was in the coffee cup, which has both Maggey's and the victim's prints, that supports his testimony. But Evidence 6 (Small Bottle) has Furio's fingerprints. Maybe the real poison was in the ear medicine, but the coffee was a decoy? But the autopsy says the cause was the coffee.

Alternatively, the timing: The Autopsy Report (10) says time of death between 1:30 and 2:30 PM. The Millionaire Radio Flyer (19) mentions an event at 1:30 PM. Maybe the victim was at the restaurant during that time. Not sure.

Wait, the key contradiction might be between Testimony 2 (Kudo says Maggey put white powder in the coffee) and Evidence 6 (Small Bottle with Furio's fingerprints). But how?

Wait, the Small Bottle is the victim's ear medicine, but it's covered in Furio's prints. So Furio had access to it. If the victim needed ear medicine, maybe Furio tampered with it. But the autopsy says death was from coffee. So perhaps the ear medicine wasn't the cause. Then why is the bottle's fingerprints important?

Alternatively, maybe the poison was administered via the ear medicine, but the coffee was a setup. But the autopsy would have detected if it was through the ear. Since the autopsy says potassium cyanide poisoning via ingestion (coffee), the ear medicine might be unrelated. Then, perhaps the contradiction is elsewhere.

Wait, let's check Testimony 4 where Kudo identifies Maggey as the serving girl. But if there's evidence that someone else was posing as Maggey. The Scooter (7) was ridden by the phony, implying someone impersonated Phoenix. Wait, the user mentions "my phony" in Evidence 7. Maybe there was an imposter. But how does that relate to Maggey?

Wait, Maggey was found guilty thanks to the phony me (Character 4's description). So someone impersonated Phoenix and got Maggey convicted. The Paper Badge (26) found at Tender Lender is fake. So maybe Furio Tigre impersonated Phoenix. But how does that tie into the testimonies?

If the imposter was involved, maybe Kudo saw the imposter, not Maggey. But Testimony 4 says the defendant is Maggey, and he saw her. But if the imposter was posing as Phoenix, maybe they framed Maggey. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the person Kudo saw wasn't Maggey but someone else in disguise. But the testimony says he recognizes her as Maggey.

Wait, the Lunch Special (5) is $20 but tastes bad. Maybe someone poisoned the coffee, but the poison wasn't in the coffee. Wait, no, the coffee has the poison. So the contradiction must be elsewhere.

Wait, the Magazine Clipping (2) says that Phoenix was trounced and his client was found guilty. That's from December 5th. But the incident was on December 3rd. If the case was on the 3rd, but the article is from the 5th, that's after the trial. Not sure.

Wait, maybe Testimony 2 claims Maggey put white powder in the coffee, but Evidence 13 (Coffee Cup) shows that the handle is on the right with a lip stain on the front. If the victim was right-handed, he would hold the cup with the handle on the right. If the poison was added to the coffee, then the cup's position makes sense. But maybe the problem is that the lip stain is on the front, which would be where the victim drank from. If the poison was in the coffee, then the victim would have drunk from there, which matches. Not sure.

Alternatively, the Sports Paper (3) has a doodle by the victim that says 'Ahahahaha' next to 'MC Bomber' and 100k crossed out. The MC Bomber virus (23) is worth millions. The victim had a meeting with Furio (The Tiger) that day. Maybe the victim was planning to sell the virus to Furio, but Furio killed him. The doodle's crossed-out 100k and laughter might indicate that the victim was mocking Furio's offer. So Furio had a motive. But how does this tie to the testimonies?

If Furio wanted to kill the victim, he might have poisoned the ear medicine. But the autopsy says death was from the coffee. Wait, but the ear medicine's bottle (6) is in the kitchen with Furio's prints. Maybe Furio switched the ear medicine with poison. But the victim's prescription bag (17) is empty. If the victim needed to take the ear medicine, and it was poisoned, but he died from the coffee, that's conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps the victim ingested the poison from both sources. But the autopsy only mentions potassium cyanide.

Another angle: The vase mentioned in Victor's Testimony (18) says he broke the vase at his seat. The Crime Photo (12) shows two vases, one on each table, both intact. Wait, no: the Crime Photo says there's an intact vase on each table. But Victor's testimony says he broke the vase at his seat. That's a contradiction. So Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) shows intact vases, but Testimony 18 (Victor's Testimony) says he broke his vase. Wait, but Testimony 18 is not from Kudo, it's Victor's own testimony. Wait, the testimonies provided are from Kudo (Testimonies 0-6). The user listed Testimonies 0-6 under 'Testimonies', all from Kudo. So Testimony 18 is not in the provided testimonies. The user's list of testimonies only includes Testimony 0 to 6, all by Kudo. So I should focus on those.

So, the testimonies to consider are 0-6, all from Kudo. Let me re-examine those.

Testimony 0: Victim was reading sports paper. Evidence 3 supports that.

Testimony 1: Maggey brought coffee and put something in it.

Testimony 2: She put white powder.

Testimony 3: Victim sipped, collapsed.

Testimony 4: Identifies Maggey as the defendant.

Testimony 5: Describes Maggey's appearance (ribbon, loose apron).

Testimony 6: Didn't notice anything from front.

Looking for contradictions between these testimonies and the evidence.

The key might be the Coffee Cup's handle and lip stain. Evidence 13: Coffee Cup has a lip stain on the front and a floral handle to the right. If the handle is on the right, then when the cup is placed, the handle is on the right side. If the victim was right-handed, he would pick it up with his right hand, bringing the lip stain to his mouth. But if the person adding the poison had to reach over, maybe the position doesn't align with Kudo's viewpoint.

Alternatively, the Crime Photo (12) shows two tables separated by a folding screen. The victim's table is the one farther away. The Coffee Cup is on that table. Kudo was sitting where? If Kudo was at the other table, behind the folding screen, could he have seen Maggey adding the powder?

The Tr√©s Bien Floor Plans (11) show X as the victim's seat. If the tables are separated by a folding screen, then Kudo's view might have been obstructed. So Testimony 2 claims he saw Maggey put powder in the coffee, but if the folding screen was there, he couldn't have seen it. That would contradict.

But the Crime Photo (12) says that from near the kitchen (where the photo was taken), the closer table is empty, and the victim's table is behind the screen. So if Kudo was at the empty table (closer to the camera/kitchen), then the folding screen would block his view of the victim's table. So he couldn't have seen Maggey adding the powder. Therefore, his testimony is contradicted by the layout.

So the contradiction is between Testimony 2 (Kudo claims he saw Maggey add powder) and Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) which shows the folding screen blocking the view. Therefore, Kudo couldn't have seen the coffee being tampered with, making his testimony false.

So the evidence is 12 (Crime Photo) and testimony 2.

{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 2}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this. So, I need to find which piece of evidence contradicts a testimony. Let me go through each testimony and see if any evidence directly conflicts with it.

First, looking at the testimonies provided by Kudo. Testimony 4 says: "The little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip." So according to Kudo, the victim used his free hand (probably the left hand since the right was holding the newspaper) to pick up the coffee cup. 

Now, checking the evidence. Evidence 13 is the Coffee Cup. It mentions that when facing the cup, there's a lip stain on the front and a floral handle to the right. If the handle is on the right side, a right-handed person would typically pick it up with their right hand, positioning the handle towards them. But if the victim used his left hand (since his right was holding the newspaper), the handle being on the right side would make it awkward. Wait, but the handle's position is on the right side from the perspective of facing the cup. So if the victim was right-handed, he might hold the cup with the right hand, but according to the testimony, he used his free (left) hand. However, the lip stain is on the front, which might indicate the direction he drank from. Hmm, but maybe the key contradiction is that if the handle is on the right, a right-handed person would naturally use their right hand. If the victim was holding the newspaper in his right hand (as per Testimony 1: "He had a newspaper in his right hand"), then he would have to use his left hand to pick up the cup. But the handle being on the right side would make it more natural for the right hand. So if he used his left hand, the handle's position might not align, causing the lip stain to be on the opposite side. But the evidence says the lip stain is on the front. Wait, maybe the position of the handle and the lip stain's location contradicts the way he held the cup. If he used his left hand, the handle would be on the right side of the cup from his perspective, which might not leave the lip stain on the front. Alternatively, if he used his right hand, the handle would be on the right, making the lip stain align. But since he was holding the newspaper in his right hand (Testimony 1), he couldn't have used that hand. So Testimony 4 says he used his free (left) hand, but the cup's handle placement (right side) suggests it's designed for right-handed use. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. The lip stain's position might also indicate which side he drank from. If the handle is on the right, and he used his left hand, the lip stain might be on the opposite side. But according to Evidence 13, the lip stain is on the front. So maybe the testimony and the evidence about the cup's handle and how he held it contradict each other. That would mean Testimony 4 (using left hand) contradicts Evidence 13's handle placement (for right hand). Therefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 13 and Testimony 4.

{"evidence": 13, "testimony": 4}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's start by going through the testimonies and evidences to find contradictions. The user wants me to find one pair where a testimony and evidence contradict each other.

First, looking at the testimonies provided. All the testimonies are from Victor Kudo (Character 7). Let's list out each testimony:

Testimony 0: Kudo starts by saying he's not sure about something. Not much to go on here.

Testimony 1: He states that the victim (Glen Elg) slumped over after sipping his javaccino. This relates to the Coffee Cup (Evidence 13) which had cyanide. But does this testimony contradict any evidence? The autopsy report (Evidence 10) says potassium cyanide poisoning, so this seems consistent.

Testimony 2: Kudo mentions that "the clumsy idiot upset the vase. He knocked it right over." The 'he' here might refer to the victim or someone else. The Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows two vases on the tables, both intact. Wait, the testimony says the vase was broken, but the photo shows intact vases. That's a contradiction. Because if the vase was broken, the photo should show it, but the photo says both vases are intact. So Testimony 2 (Testimony index 2) contradicts Evidence 12 (Crime Photo). 

Wait, but Testimony 3 says the vase broke and the cloth got soaked. But the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows that there's a coffee cup knocked over, staining the tablecloth. The vases in the photo are intact. So Testimony 2 and 3 both mention a broken vase and a soaked cloth. But the Crime Photo's description says the coffee cup is knocked over, staining the table cloth, and the vases are intact. That suggests that the coffee caused the stain, not the vase breaking. So Kudo's testimony about the vase breaking and soaking the cloth conflicts with the photo evidence which shows the vases are intact, and the stain is from coffee. Therefore, Testimony 2 or 3 contradicts Evidence 12.

Looking at Evidence 12: "Two dining tables are separated by a folding screen. The one closer to the camera is empty. The other one is where the victim collapsed on the table. There is an intact vase on each table. A coffee cup is knocked over and the table cloth is stained by coffee." So the vases are intact, but Kudo's testimony says the vase was broken. Therefore, Testimony 2 (says the vase was knocked over) contradicts Evidence 12 (vases intact). So the contradiction is between Testimony 2 and Evidence 12. But wait, in the testimonies, Testimony 2 and 3 both refer to the vase breaking. However, Testimony 18 (Victor's Testimony) says "When the incident occurred, I broke the vase at my seat. I'm sorry." Oh wait, but the testimonies listed here are Testimony 0 to 4, all under Kudo. Wait, the user provided Testimonies 0-4 as Testimony entries with Person: Kudo. Testimony 18 is listed under Evidence 18 as Victor's Testimony. Wait, looking back at the given data:

In the Testimonies section, the user lists Testimony 0 to Testimony 4, all by Kudo. Then in the Evidences, there's Evidence 18: Victor's Testimony, which is "When the incident occurred, I broke the vase at my seat. I'm sorry." But according to the problem, we should only consider the Testimonies section (Testimony 0-4) provided, not the Evidence 18. Wait, no. The user split the data into Characters, Evidences, and Testimonies. The Testimonies section lists Testimony 0-4, each with a Person (Kudo). Then, there's an Evidence 18 called "Victor's Testimony", which is part of the Evidences list, not the Testimonies list. So when looking for contradictions between Testimonies (0-4) and Evidences (0-27), we need to check if any of Kudo's testimonies (0-4) contradict any of the evidences (0-27). 

In Testimony 2, Kudo says that "the clumsy idiot upset the vase. He knocked it right over." The "clumsy idiot" could be referring to someone else. But according to Evidence 12 (Crime Photo), the vases are intact. So if Kudo says the vase was knocked over and broken, but the photo shows intact vases, that's a contradiction. Therefore, Testimony 2 (index 2) contradicts Evidence 12 (Crime Photo). However, looking at Evidence 18 (Victor's Testimony) which is part of the Evidences list: "When the incident occurred, I broke the vase at my seat. I'm sorry." So Victor (Kudo) is admitting he broke the vase. But according to the Crime Photo (Evidence 12), the vases are intact. Therefore, Victor's own testimony (Evidence 18) contradicts the Crime Photo. But the user's question is about Testimonies (0-4) versus Evidences. So Evidence 18 is separate, but the Testimonies section (0-4) are from Kudo. Wait, the Testimonies listed (0-4) are labeled as Person: Kudo, so those are his statements during testimony. Let me recheck:

Testimony 2 (Person Kudo): "Well, the clumsy idiot upset the vase. He knocked it right over."

Testimony 3 (Person Kudo): "It broke, and the strip of cloth covering the table got completely soaked!"

But in the Crime Photo (Evidence 12), the vases are intact. So if Kudo says the vase was broken and caused the tablecloth to be soaked, but the photo shows intact vases and the cloth is stained by coffee, that's a contradiction. Therefore, Testimony 2 or 3 (which are part of the Testimonies list) contradict Evidence 12. But which testimony exactly?

Looking at the wording: Testimony 2 says the vase was knocked over. Testimony 3 says it broke and the cloth got soaked. The Crime Photo shows the vases are intact. Therefore, Testimony 2 and 3 both are contradicted by Evidence 12.

Alternatively, perhaps the contradiction is between Kudo's testimony and his own statement in Evidence 18. Wait, Evidence 18 is a separate piece of evidence, which is Victor's Testimony. So if in Testimony 2 and 3, Kudo says the vase was broken by "the clumsy idiot", but in Evidence 18, he says he broke it himself. That would be a contradiction within his own statements. But the user's question is about contradictions between a testimony (from Testimonies list) and evidence (from Evidences list). So perhaps Evidence 18 (Victor's Testimony) is part of the Evidences, which is a written note, while Testimonies 0-4 are verbal testimonies. So if in his verbal testimony (Testimonies 2 and 3), he says someone else broke the vase, but in his written testimony (Evidence 18) he admits to breaking it himself, that's a contradiction. However, the user's instruction is to pick a pair where evidence and testimony contradict each other. So Evidence 18 (Victor's Testimony) and Testimony 2 or 3.

But in the Testimonies list provided (0-4), Testimony 2 and 3 are part of Kudo's testimonies. Evidence 18 is Victor's Testimony, which is part of the Evidences. So the contradiction would be between Testimony 2 (Kudo saying someone else broke the vase) and Evidence 18 (Victor's written testimony where he says he broke it himself). That would be a contradiction. But according to the user's list, the testimonies are numbered 0-4, and the evidences 0-27. So Evidence 18 is separate from the Testimonies.

But the user's question is about Testimonies (0-4) and Evidences (0-27). So the possible contradiction is between Testimony 2 (Kudo says someone else broke the vase) and Evidence 18 (Kudo admits he broke it). That would be a contradiction. But according to the user's data:

Testimony 2 (Person: Kudo): "Well, the clumsy idiot upset the vase. He knocked it right over."

Evidence 18: Victor's Testimony (Person: Victor Kudo): "When the incident occurred, I broke the vase at my seat. I'm sorry."

So this is a contradiction: in his testimony (Testimony 2), he blames someone else (the "clumsy idiot"), but in Evidence 18, he admits to breaking it himself. So that would be a contradiction between Testimony 2 (Testimony index 2) and Evidence 18. But the user asks to output the evidence number and testimony number. Evidence 18 is number 18, Testimony 2 is number 2.

Alternatively, the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows intact vases, which contradicts Testimony 2 and 3. So which is the correct pair?

The problem says "which evidence and testimony contradict each other?" So which pair is it?

If Testimony 2 says the vase was knocked over, but the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows the vases are intact, that's a direct contradiction. So that would be Testimony 2 and Evidence 12.

Alternatively, Testimony 18 (Evidence 18) says he broke it, but the photo shows it's intact. But Testimony 18 is part of the Evidences, not the Testimonies list.

So according to the given Testimonies (0-4), Testimony 2 and 3 state that the vase was broken, but Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) says the vases are intact. So the contradiction is between Testimony 2 (index 2) and Evidence 12 (index 12).

Therefore, the correct pair is Evidence 12 and Testimony 2.

{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 2}

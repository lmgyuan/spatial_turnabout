Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other here. The user wants only one pair, so I need to look through all the testimonies and evidences to find a contradiction.

First, let's go through the testimonies. The testimonies are from Larry Butz (Testimony 0 to 5). Let me check each one. 

Testimony 3 says: "Then, just as I was thinking about going home, I heard this 'bang'!" So Larry heard a single bang. Then in Testimony 5, he says he went home after hearing a single gunshot. So according to his testimony, he heard one gunshot.

Now, looking at the evidences. Evidence 11 is Lotta's Deposition, which states she heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25. That's a contradiction because Larry says one, Lotta says two.

Another possibility: Evidence 2 is Lotta's Camera, set to take a picture when a loud noise is detected. Evidence 4 is the Lake Photo taken automatically on 12/25 at 12:15 AM. Maybe the photo shows something that contradicts Larry's statement about not seeing the boat (Testimony 4). But wait, Testimony 4 says he didn't notice the boat when he looked out. The Lake Photo might show a boat, which would contradict that. However, Evidence 16 is the Second Lake Photo taken at 11:50 PM on 12/24, which shows an empty lake. Then Evidence 4 (taken 12:15 AM 12/25) might show something else. But Larry said he heard the bang and then looked but didn't see the boat. If the camera took a photo at 12:15 AM, maybe the boat was present then, contradicting his statement. But I need to check what the Lake Photo shows. If the photo shows the boat, then Larry's Testimony 4 (he didn't notice the boat) is contradicted by the photo. But since the camera is set to take pictures when there's a loud noise, the photo might have been triggered by the gunshot. But Larry heard one gunshot, Lotta's testimony (Evidence 11) says two. So the main contradiction here is between Larry's Testimony 5 (single gunshot) and Lotta's Deposition (two gunshots). That would be a contradiction between Testimony 5 (says one) and Evidence 11 (says two). But the user wants the answer in the JSON format, so the evidence would be 11 and testimony 5. But let's check the details again.

Wait, Testimony 3 says he heard a "bang", and Testimony 5 says after the single gunshot. So Larry claims one shot. Evidence 11 is Lotta's Deposition, which states she heard two. That's a direct contradiction. So the pair would be Evidence 11 (Testimony from Lotta) and Testimony 5 (from Larry). Therefore, the correct pair is evidence 11 and testimony 5. But let me check the evidence numbers again. Evidence 11 is Lotta's Deposition. Testimony 5 is Larry's testimony about one gunshot. So yes, that's a contradiction. Alternatively, maybe the camera took two photos? Wait, the camera is set to take a picture when a loud noise is detected. If there were two gunshots, the camera would have taken two pictures? But the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) is one taken at 12:15 AM, and the Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16) at 11:50 PM. So maybe only one photo was taken after midnight. But according to Lotta's Deposition, she heard two shots after midnight. If the camera took one photo at 12:15, maybe that corresponds to one shot, but Lotta heard two. That would contradict if the camera only captured one. But the problem is that the camera might have been triggered once, but if there were two loud noises, maybe it took two pictures. However, the user didn't specify that there are two photos from the same night. The evidences include Lake Photo (12/25 12:15) and Second Lake Photo (12/24 11:50 PM). So after midnight, only one photo was taken. That would support Lotta's claim of two shots if the camera's only triggered once. But maybe the camera's settings only allow one photo per event? Not sure. Alternatively, the contradiction could be between Larry's Testimony 5 (one shot) and Lotta's Deposition (two shots). So the evidence is 11 and testimony is 5. That's the main contradiction. So the answer should be {"evidence": 11, "testimony": 5}.

Wait, but let me check again. Testimony 3: Larry heard a "bang". Testimony 5: after the single gunshot he went home. So his testimony is one shot. Evidence 11: Lotta says two. So that's a direct contradiction. Therefore, the pair is evidence 11 and testimony 5. That seems correct.

{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 5}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the problem is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants only one pair, and I need to output it in JSON at the end. Let's start by looking at the testimonies and the evidences provided.

First, the testimonies given are all from Larry Butz (Testimony 0 to 5). Let's read through them. Testimony 5 says that Larry heard a gunshot just when the DJ said "Hey! It's almost Christmas!" So he claims to have heard the gunshot at that specific moment, which I assume was around midnight since Christmas Eve transitions to Christmas Day at 12 AM. 

Now, looking at the evidences. Evidence 2 is Lotta's Camera, which is set to automatically take a picture when a loud noise is detected. Evidence 4 is the Lake Photo taken automatically on 12/25 at 12:15 AM. Evidence 16 is the Second Lake Photo taken on 12/24 at 11:50 PM. Also, Evidence 11 is Lotta's Deposition stating she heard two gunshots just after midnight on 12/25. 

Wait, Larry's testimony says he heard the gunshot when the DJ mentioned Christmas, which I think is around midnight. But according to the camera's photo (Evidence 4), the photo was taken at 12:15 AM. If the gunshot happened at midnight, the camera should have taken a photo then, right? But the photo is at 12:15. Maybe there's a discrepancy here. Also, Larry's testimony about the timing might conflict with the camera's photo time. 

Wait, but Larry says he heard the gunshot when the DJ said "It's almost Christmas!" which would be just before midnight. But if the photo was taken at 12:15 AM, that's 15 minutes after midnight. Maybe the camera didn't trigger at midnight when the gunshot occurred, but later. But why? Unless the gunshot that Larry heard wasn't the same as the one captured by the camera. Wait, but Lotta's deposition (Testimony 11) says she heard two gunshots just after midnight. So maybe there were two shots: one at midnight (which Larry heard) and another at 12:15 (captured by the camera). But wait, the Autopsy Report (Evidence 3) mentions the victim was shot once. Hmm, maybe there's more to it.

Alternatively, the contradiction could be between Larry's testimony and the Lake Photo's timing. Larry says he heard the gunshot when the DJ was talking, which would be around midnight. But the Lake Photo taken at 12:15 AM shows something (maybe the crime happening then). But how does that contradict? Let me check the camera's details. Evidence 2 says the camera is set to take a picture when a loud noise is detected, facing the lake. If the murder happened at 12:15, then the gunshot at that time would trigger the camera. But Larry's testimony says he heard a gunshot at midnight. However, the Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16) is taken at 11:50 PM, which is before midnight, and shows an empty lake. If Larry's gunshot was at midnight, but the camera didn't take a photo then, but took one at 12:15, that might suggest that the actual murder happened at 12:15, contradicting Larry's testimony about hearing it at midnight. Alternatively, maybe the DJ's comment was at midnight, but Larry heard the shot then, but the camera didn't pick it up until 12:15. But maybe the camera only took one photo at 12:15, meaning the shot was then, and Larry's testimony is wrong. So the contradiction would be between Testimony 5 (Larry hearing the shot at midnight) and Evidence 4 (Lake Photo at 12:15 AM), which shows the murder happened later. But how? Wait, the camera is triggered by loud noises. If there was a shot at midnight, the camera should have taken a photo then. But the photos taken are at 11:50 PM (Evidence 16) and 12:15 AM (Evidence 4). So if Larry heard a gunshot at midnight, why isn't there a photo then? That would mean his testimony is contradicted by the lack of a photo at midnight. But the camera's existence (Evidence 2) says it's set to take photos when loud noises happen. So if Larry's testimony is that he heard a gunshot at midnight, but the camera didn't capture anything at that time (since the next photo is 12:15), that's a contradiction. Therefore, Evidence 2 (the camera's setup) combined with the photo times (Evidence 4 and 16) would show that no loud noise occurred at midnight, contradicting Larry's Testimony 5. But wait, Evidence 11 (Lotta's Deposition) says she heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight. So that's two shots after midnight. But the camera took a photo at 12:15, which might be the second shot. Then the first shot would be at midnight, but the camera didn't capture it. But why? Maybe the first shot was not loud enough, or the camera wasn't facing the right direction. However, the camera is facing the lake. If the murder happened on the lake, then the shot at 12:15 would be captured, but the earlier shot (midnight) would not have been. That could indicate that the midnight shot was somewhere else, but Larry is saying he heard it. Alternatively, maybe the popper (Evidence 1) was used to create a fake gunshot sound at midnight, which Larry heard, but the actual murder was at 12:15. The popper makes a "bang" sound when pulled, so if someone used that at midnight, that's the sound Larry heard, not a real gunshot. Then the real murder happened at 12:15, captured by the camera. Therefore, the contradiction is between Larry's Testimony 5 (hearing a gunshot at midnight) and the Popper (Evidence 1) being a noisemaker that could have made that sound, not a real gun. But then how does that tie in? Alternatively, the contradiction is between the camera's photo timing and Larry's testimony. If the camera was set to take photos on loud noises, and there's no photo at midnight, then Larry's testimony about hearing a gunshot at midnight is contradicted by the lack of photo evidence. Therefore, the evidence would be the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) at 12:15 and the Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16) at 11:50. If the camera was active and there's no photo at midnight, then Larry's claim of a gunshot at midnight is contradicted. But which evidence directly contradicts that? The camera's existence (Evidence 2) says it takes photos on loud noises. So if there was a loud noise (gunshot) at midnight, there should be a photo. But the photos are at 11:50 and 12:15. Therefore, the lack of a photo at midnight (since there's no evidence for that time) would contradict Larry's Testimony 5. So the evidence would be Evidence 2 (Lotta's Camera) which shows that any loud noise would trigger a photo. Since there's no photo at midnight, Larry's testimony about a gunshot then is contradicted. But the user wants the evidence number and testimony number. So, Testimony 5 is Larry's claim about the gunshot at the DJ's statement (midnight), and the evidence that contradicts this could be Evidence 2 (the camera's setup) combined with the photo times. But the user might be looking for a direct contradiction between a specific evidence and testimony. Alternatively, maybe Evidence 1 (Popper) is the contradiction. The popper makes a bang sound, so the gunshot Larry heard was actually the popper. If someone used the popper to fake a gunshot sound at midnight, then the real murder happened later. So Testimony 5 (hearing a gunshot) is contradicted by Evidence 1 (the popper's existence, which could have made that sound). But I need to check if the popper is present in the case. Alternatively, if the camera took a photo at 12:15, which shows the actual murder, then Larry's testimony about the time is wrong. So the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) shows the real time as 12:15, contradicting Larry's claim of midnight. Therefore, Evidence 4 contradicts Testimony 5. That would be the pair: Evidence 4 and Testimony 5. That's possible. But the user wants only one pair. Let me confirm. Testimony 5 says the gunshot was heard when the DJ said "It's almost Christmas!" which is likely just before midnight. But the Lake Photo is taken at 12:15 AM. So if the murder happened at 12:15, then Larry's testimony is wrong. But wait, the Autopsy Report (Evidence 3) says time of death is 24th or 25th. The camera's photo at 12:15 AM on 25th shows the crime, which would be after midnight. So Larry's testimony says he heard the shot at midnight, but the murder actually happened at 12:15, captured by the camera. Therefore, Evidence 4 (Lake Photo at 12:15) contradicts Testimony 5 (gunshot at midnight). So the answer would be {"evidence": 4, "testimony": 5}. Alternatively, the Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16) taken at 11:50 PM shows the lake empty, then the Lake Photo at 12:15 shows something. But how does that relate to Larry's testimony. Hmm. Another angle: Larry claims the shot was at the same time as the DJ's comment, which is "almost Christmas" implying just before midnight. If the camera took a photo at 12:15, that's 15 minutes after midnight, meaning the shot was then, so Larry's testimony is wrong. Therefore, Evidence 4 contradicts Testimony 5. That seems plausible.

{"evidence": 4, "testimony": 5}

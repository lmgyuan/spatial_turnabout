Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants only one pair, so I need to look through the given testimonies and evidences to find a direct contradiction.

First, let me go through the testimonies provided. The testimonies are all from Larry Butz (Character 4). Testimony 0 says he was out in a boat on the lake. Then Testimony 3 mentions he heard a "bang" just as he was thinking about going home. Testimony 5 states that after hearing a single gunshot, he went home. Wait, in Testimony 3 he says he heard a "bang", but in Testimony 5 he refers to it as a gunshot. Hmm, but maybe that's just his way of describing it. Let's check the evidence.

Looking at the evidence list, Evidence 2 is Lotta's Camera, which is set to take pictures automatically when a loud noise is detected. The Lake Photo (Evidence 4) was taken on 12/25 at 12:15 AM. The Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16) was taken on 12/24 at 11:50 PM. Lotta's Deposition (Evidence 11) says she heard two gunshot-like sounds just after midnight on 12/25. 

Now, Larry's Testimony 5 says he heard a single gunshot and went home. But according to Lotta's Deposition (Evidence 11), there were two sounds like gunshots. That's a contradiction. Larry claims one shot, but Lotta's evidence says two. So the testimony (Testimony 5) states one shot, but the evidence (Evidence 11) says two. However, Testimony 5 is Larry's, while Evidence 11 is Lotta's deposition. So the contradiction would be between Testimony 5 (Larry) and Evidence 11 (Lotta). But wait, the problem says "evidence and testimony contradict each other", so maybe the evidence is directly contradicting the testimony. 

Alternatively, let's check other possibilities. Larry's Testimony 3 says he heard a "bang", and Evidence 1 is a popper, which is a party noisemaker that goes "bang". Maybe the "bang" he heard was the popper, not a gunshot. But in Testimony 5, he refers to it as a gunshot. So if the actual gunshot was the real one, but he heard the popper, that could be a contradiction. But how does that tie into evidence?

Alternatively, looking at the camera: Evidence 2's camera takes a photo when a loud noise is detected. The photo was taken at 12:15 AM on 12/25. If Larry heard a bang at midnight, maybe the camera would have taken a photo then. Wait, but the camera's photo at 12:15 AM (Evidence 4) might show something relevant. But Larry's testimony says he heard a bang just after midnight (since he was thinking about going home, then heard it), which would align with the camera's photo time. Hmm.

Wait, Lotta's deposition (Evidence 11) says she heard two gunshot-like sounds just after midnight on 12/25. But Larry's Testimony 5 says he heard a single gunshot. So if the camera took a picture at 12:15 AM, which would be after midnight, maybe that's when the shots happened. Larry says one shot, but Lotta says two. That's a contradiction between Testimony 5 (single shot) and Evidence 11 (two sounds). However, the question is asking for evidence and testimony that contradict. So Evidence 11 is Lotta's deposition, which is evidence. Testimony 5 is Larry's. So that would be a contradiction between Testimony 5 (Larry) and Evidence 11 (Lotta's statement). 

Alternatively, Evidence 10 is the Pistol, which was fired 3 times. The Autopsy Report (Evidence 3) mentions a single bullet to the heart. So if the pistol was fired three times, but only one bullet was found, that's another contradiction. But how does that relate to testimonies? The testimony in question would need to mention the number of shots. Larry's Testimony 5 says he heard a single gunshot. The pistol being fired three times would mean three shots were fired, which contradicts Larry's Testimony 5. But then, the Evidence 10 (pistol fired 3 times) would contradict Testimony 5 (single shot heard). However, the user wants a pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other. Let's check this. If the pistol was fired three times, but Larry only heard one shot, that's a contradiction. So Evidence 10 (pistol fired 3 times) vs Testimony 5 (single shot heard). But then, the autopsy report says cause of death was one bullet. So if three shots were fired, maybe two missed? But Larry only heard one. That would be a contradiction between Testimony 5 (1 shot heard) and Evidence 10 (3 shots fired). However, the testimony says "after I heard that single gunshot I went home." If the gun was fired three times, but Larry only heard one, that's a problem. So this would be a contradiction between Testimony 5 and Evidence 10. 

Alternatively, Lotta's camera (Evidence 2) is set to take pictures when loud noises occur. The Lake Photo (Evidence 4) was taken at 12:15 AM, which is after midnight. If Larry heard a gunshot at that time, but the camera didn't take a photo earlier when the other shots were fired? But I'm not sure. 

Wait, Evidence 11 (Lotta's Deposition) says she heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight. That's two shots. Testimony 5 (Larry) says he heard a single shot. So the contradiction here is between Testimony 5 and Evidence 11. But Evidence 11 is a deposition, which is testimony from Lotta, but in the evidence list. So is Evidence 11 considered as evidence? Yes. So the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (Larry's statement) and Evidence 11 (Lotta's deposition). So the pair would be Evidence 11 and Testimony 5. But the user wants the answer in the form of evidence number and testimony number. Evidence 11 is number 11, Testimony 5 is number 5. So the answer would be {"evidence": 11, "testimony": 5}. 

But let me check again. Another angle: Larry's Testimony 3 says he heard a "bang" and Testimony 5 says he heard a gunshot. But the popper (Evidence 1) is a noisemaker that goes "bang". So maybe the "bang" he heard was the popper, not a gunshot. That would mean his testimony about hearing a gunshot (Testimony 5) is contradicted by the presence of the popper. But how does that connect? If the popper was used to create a fake gunshot sound, then Testimony 5's claim of a gunshot is contradicted by Evidence 1, which is a noisemaker that can make a bang. But Larry might have mistaken the popper's sound for a gunshot. However, this might not be a direct contradiction, as the popper's existence doesn't necessarily mean that's what he heard. It's possible, but not a direct contradiction. 

Alternatively, the Autopsy Report (Evidence 3) states the victim was shot from approximately one meter away. If Larry was in a boat on the lake (Testimony 0), how could he have heard the shot from a distance? But that's more about the location, maybe not a direct contradiction. 

Looking back, the strongest contradiction is between Testimony 5 (single gunshot) and Evidence 11 (two gunshot-like sounds). So that's the pair. The evidence is 11 and testimony is 5. Let me confirm the indices. Evidence 11 is Lotta's Deposition, Testimony 5 is Larry's fifth testimony. Yes. So the answer should be {"evidence": 11, "testimony": 5}.

{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 5}
Okay, let's tackle this. The task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let me go through the given information step by step.

First, the characters don't seem directly relevant here, but maybe their relationships could hint at motives. But the main focus is on the evidence and testimonies.

Looking at the testimonies, all are from Larry Butz (Testimony 0 to 5). His statements revolve around hearing a gunshot on Christmas Eve. Specifically, Testimony 5 says he heard the gunshot when the DJ said, "Hey! It's almost Christmas!" which would be just before midnight on the 24th turning into the 25th. So he claims the gunshot was around midnight on the 24th.

Now checking the evidence. Evidence 16 is the Second Lake Photo, taken automatically on 12/24 at 11:50 PM. It shows an empty lake. Then Evidence 4 is the Lake Photo taken on 12/25 at 12:15 AM. If Lotta's Camera (Evidence 2) is set to take pictures when a loud noise is detected, then the photo at 12:15 AM (which is the 25th) might show the aftermath of the gunshot. But Larry's testimony places the gunshot at almost midnight on the 24th, which should trigger the camera then. However, the Second Lake Photo at 11:50 PM (24th) shows nothing, and the next photo is at 12:15 AM (25th). If the gunshot was at midnight, the camera should have taken a photo at that time, but there's no photo between 11:50 PM and 12:15 AM. So Larry's claim of hearing the gunshot at almost midnight (24th) contradicts the camera evidence, which didn't capture anything until 12:15 AM. Therefore, the camera's photo (Evidence 2) and Larry's Testimony 5 (or Testimony 3) might be conflicting.

Wait, Evidence 11 is Lotta's Deposition, where she says she heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25. That's after midnight, so the 25th. But Larry's testimony places the gunshot on the 24th at almost midnight. So Larry's Testimony 5 (time of gunshot) contradicts Lotta's Deposition (Evidence 11) about the timing. Alternatively, if the camera took a photo at 12:15 AM (Evidence 4), which is after midnight, but Larry says he heard it before midnight. However, the Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16) at 11:50 PM shows nothing. If the gunshot was at almost midnight (as per Larry), the camera should have taken a photo then. But there's a 25-minute gap between 11:50 PM and 12:15 AM. So if the gunshot was at midnight, the camera would have been triggered then, but there's no photo for that time. Therefore, the camera's automatic photo at 12:15 AM (Evidence 4) might be the one showing the result, but Larry's testimony about the time contradicts the camera's evidence. Alternatively, the camera's setup (Evidence 2) says it takes a picture when a loud noise is detected. So if Larry heard a gunshot at midnight, the camera should have taken a photo then, but there's no photo until 12:15 AM. Therefore, the absence of a photo at midnight contradicts Larry's testimony. However, the available photos are at 11:50 PM (empty) and 12:15 AM. The gunshot would have triggered a photo at the time it was heard. Since Larry's testimony says the gunshot was at almost midnight (24th), which is around 11:59 PM, the camera would have taken a photo then. But the only photos are at 11:50 PM (no gunshot) and 12:15 AM. So the contradiction is that Larry says the gunshot was at a time when the camera should have taken a photo, but there's no photo between 11:50 PM and 12:15 AM. Therefore, Evidence 2 (Lotta's Camera) and Testimony 5 (Larry's timing) contradict each other. Alternatively, maybe the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) taken at 12:15 AM shows something that contradicts Larry's timing. Wait, Evidence 3 is the Autopsy Report stating time of death as 24th or 25th. But the key contradiction is the timing of the gunshot. Larry's testimony says the gunshot was at almost midnight (24th), but the camera didn't take a photo until 12:15 AM (25th). If the camera was functional and set to trigger on loud noises, then the gunshot should have been captured at the time Larry heard it, but there's no photo for that time. Therefore, Larry's Testimony 5 (hearing the gunshot at almost midnight on 24th) contradicts the camera's evidence (Evidence 2 and 4), specifically the lack of a photo at that time. However, the problem might be that the camera's first photo after 11:50 PM is at 12:15 AM. If the gunshot happened at midnight, the camera would have taken a photo then, but it's missing. Therefore, Larry's Testimony 5 contradicts Evidence 4 (Lake Photo) because the photo was taken 15 minutes after the gunshot he claims. But the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) shows something relevant. Wait, perhaps the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) taken at 12:15 AM shows the lake with the victim's body, but if the murder occurred at midnight, then the body would have been there at that time. However, the Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16) at 11:50 PM shows the lake empty, and the 12:15 AM photo shows the body. That would align with the time of death being after 11:50 PM. But Larry's testimony places the gunshot at almost midnight (24th), which is between 11:50 PM and 12:15 AM. The contradiction here is that if the camera is triggered by loud noises, then the gunshot should have been captured by the camera at the time Larry heard it, but there's no photo at that time. The camera only took a photo at 12:15 AM. Therefore, Larry's claim of hearing the gunshot at almost midnight (Testimony 5) is contradicted by the camera's evidence (Evidence 4) which shows the photo taken 15 minutes later. But the evidence that directly contradicts would be Evidence 2 (the camera's setup) and Testimony 5. Alternatively, maybe the camera's presence (Evidence 2) and the fact that it didn't capture the gunshot at the time Larry claims. Since the camera was set to take pictures when a loud noise is detected, then if Larry heard a gunshot at almost midnight, the camera should have taken a photo then. However, the next photo is at 12:15 AM. The absence of a photo at midnight would mean that either there was no gunshot then (contradicting Larry) or the camera didn't trigger. But since the camera did trigger later, maybe the gunshot was at 12:15 AM, which contradicts Larry's testimony. Therefore, the contradiction is between Larry's Testimony 5 (gunshot at almost midnight) and the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) taken at 12:15 AM. But Evidence 4's timing is 12:15 AM, which is after Larry's claimed time. Therefore, if the gunshot was at 12:15, then Larry's testimony is wrong. Alternatively, if the camera was triggered by the gunshot at 12:15, then Larry's testimony about hearing it at almost midnight is wrong. Thus, the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (gunshot at almost midnight) and Evidence 4 (photo at 12:15 AM). But the problem is that the camera only takes a photo when a loud noise is detected. So if Larry heard the gunshot at almost midnight (say 11:59 PM), the camera should have taken a photo then. However, the next photo is at 12:15 AM. There's a gap between 11:50 PM and 12:15 AM. If the camera is automatic, perhaps it only takes photos when a noise occurs. So if the gunshot happened at 11:59 PM, the camera would have taken a photo then. But there is no photo for that time, only at 12:15. Therefore, the lack of a photo at 11:59 PM contradicts Larry's Testimony 5. However, the available evidences are the two photos: 11:50 PM (empty) and 12:15 AM. The camera's existence (Evidence 2) is the key here. So the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (gunshot at almost midnight) and Evidence 2 (the camera's presence and functionality), which should have captured the noise but didn't. Alternatively, the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) shows the result of the gunshot, which happened at 12:15 AM. Therefore, Larry's testimony about the timing is contradicted by the camera's photo time. The correct pair would be Evidence 4 (Lake Photo at 12:15) and Testimony 5 (gunshot at almost midnight). But the problem is that Evidence 2 is the camera itself, which is set to take pictures upon loud noises. The fact that there's no photo between 11:50 PM and 12:15 AM except the one at 12:15 AM suggests that the gunshot happened at 12:15, not earlier. Therefore, Larry's Testimony 5 (hearing the gunshot at almost midnight, which would be 24th) is contradicted by the camera's photo at 12:15 AM (25th) (Evidence 4), which would have been triggered by the gunshot. So the contradiction is Testimony 5 and Evidence 4. However, Evidence 4 is the Lake Photo taken at 12:15, which is 15 minutes after midnight. But the gunshot could have been at 12:15. Alternatively, perhaps the autopsy report (Evidence 3) states the time of death as 24th or 25th, but that's too broad. Let me check the exact testimonies and evidences again.

Testimony 5: Larry says he heard the gunshot when the DJ said "Hey! It's almost Christmas!" which would be just before midnight on the 24th. So he's saying the gunshot was on the 24th. But the camera's photo (Evidence 4) was taken on the 25th at 12:15 AM. However, Evidence 11 is Lotta's Deposition, where she says she heard two gunshots just after midnight on 12/25. So Lotta's testimony aligns with the camera's photo time. Therefore, Larry's Testimony 5 (gunshot on 24th) contradicts both Lotta's Deposition (Evidence 11) and the Lake Photo (Evidence 4). But the question asks for one pair of evidence and testimony. The most direct contradiction is between Larry's Testimony 5 (gunshot at almost midnight on 24th) and the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) taken on 25th at 12:15 AM, implying the gunshot was then. But how does that directly contradict? Because the camera's photo at 12:15 AM would have been triggered by the gunshot. So the gunshot happened at 12:15 AM, contradicting Larry's claim of hearing it at almost midnight. Therefore, the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) contradicts Larry's Testimony 5. Alternatively, the camera's existence (Evidence 2) and its setup (auto-take photo on loud noise) contradicts Larry's Testimony 5, since if the gunshot was at midnight, the camera would have taken a photo then. But the next photo is at 12:15 AM, suggesting the actual gunshot was then. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 5 and Evidence 4. Another angle: Evidence 16 (Second Lake Photo) taken on 24th at 11:50 PM shows an empty lake, and Evidence 4 (Lake Photo) at 12:15 AM on 25th shows the crime scene. Therefore, the murder happened between those times. Larry says the gunshot was at almost midnight (24th), but the camera's photo at 12:15 AM (25th) shows the result. However, the actual gunshot would have been at 12:15 AM, which contradicts Larry's testimony. Therefore, Evidence 4 (Lake Photo) contradicts Testimony 5. Alternatively, Larry's Testimony 5 claims the gunshot at a time when the lake was empty (per Evidence 16). But if the murder happened later, then Larry's testimony is wrong. However, the key contradiction is the timing. The correct answer is {"evidence": 2, "testimony": 5}? Wait, Evidence 2 is Lotta's Camera. The testimony is Testimony 5 (Larry's claim of time). The camera is set to take photos on loud noises, which should have taken a photo at the time of the gunshot. If Larry heard it at almost midnight, but the camera didn't take a photo until 12:15 AM, then the camera's existence and function (Evidence 2) contradicts Larry's Testimony 5. Alternatively, the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) shows the time of the gunshot as 12:15 AM, contradicting Larry's Testimony 5. But Evidence 4's description says it was taken automatically on 12/25 at 12:15 AM. The photo would show the scene after the gunshot. Therefore, the gunshot must have occurred at or just before 12:15 AM. If Larry says he heard it at almost midnight (24th), that's 25 minutes earlier, which is a contradiction. Therefore, Evidence 4 (Lake Photo's time) contradicts Testimony 5. So the correct pair is Evidence 4 and Testimony 5. But the question allows only one pair. Let me check the evidence numbers again.

Evidence 2: Lotta's Camera, which is set to take pictures when a loud noise is detected. If Larry's Testimony 5 says he heard the gunshot at almost midnight, the camera should have taken a picture then. But there's no picture between 11:50 PM and 12:15 AM. The absence of a photo at midnight would imply there was no loud noise (gunshot) then, contradicting Larry's testimony. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 5 and the lack of a photo at that time. However, the available evidences are the photos at 11:50 and 12:15. The lack of a photo between them is indirect. The camera's existence (Evidence 2) and its function would imply that any loud noise (like a gunshot) should trigger a photo. Therefore, Larry's testimony claims a gunshot at a time when the camera should have taken a photo, but there's no such photo. Thus, Evidence 2 (camera's function) contradicts Testimony 5 (Larry's claim). Alternatively, the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) shows the result of the gunshot at 12:15 AM, which is when the actual shot happened, contradicting Larry's Testimony 5. But the camera's photo at 12:15 AM was triggered by the gunshot, which would mean the gunshot happened at that time. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (gunshot at almost midnight) and Evidence 4 (photo at 12:15 AM). But how does the photo's timing directly contradict the testimony? Because the photo was taken at 12:15 AM, which is after midnight, so the gunshot must have happened then, not before. Therefore, the correct pair is Evidence 4 (Lake Photo) and Testimony 5. However, the user might expect the answer to be Evidence 2 (the camera) and Testimony 3 or 5. Let me recheck. Testimony 3 is "But I'm sure I heard that gunshot!" which is general. Testimony 5 specifies the timing. The camera's existence and the lack of a photo at the time Larry claims (midnight) would contradict his testimony. Since the camera should have captured the noise, but there's no photo for that time, the contradiction is between the camera (Evidence 2) and Testimony 5. But the camera's photos are Evidence 4 and 16. Maybe the combination of Evidence 2 and 4, but the question allows only one evidence. Therefore, the best answer is Evidence 4 and Testimony 5. But the user might expect Evidence 2 and Testimony 5. Alternatively, Evidence 16 (Second Lake Photo) shows the lake empty at 11:50 PM. If the murder happened at midnight, the body would be there, but the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) shows the body at 12:15 AM. So the time between 11:50 PM and 12:15 AM is when the murder occurred. Larry's testimony says the gunshot was at almost midnight, but the body was in the lake by 12:15 AM. But that's not a direct contradiction. The direct contradiction is the timing of the gunshot. The camera's photo at 12:15 AM indicates the gunshot happened then, contradicting Larry's claim of hearing it at almost midnight. Therefore, the answer is {"evidence": 4, "testimony": 5}.

Wait, but Evidence 4's description says "Taken automatically on 12/25 at 12:15 AM. Click here for details." Assuming that the photo shows the murder scene, which would be after the gunshot. The gunshot would have triggered the camera, meaning the photo was taken at the time of the gunshot. So if the photo is at 12:15 AM, the gunshot was at that time, contradicting Larry's Testimony 5 (almost midnight, 24th). Therefore, the correct pair is Evidence 4 and Testimony 5.

Alternatively, Evidence 2 is the camera itself, which is programmed to take photos on loud noises. Testimony 5 claims a gunshot at almost midnight, which should have triggered the camera then, but there's no photo until 12:15 AM. Therefore, the camera's existence (Evidence 2) contradicts Testimony 5. But the camera's existence alone isn't the contradiction; the lack of a photo at that time is. Since the user provided Evidence 16 (Second Lake Photo at 11:50 PM, empty) and Evidence 4 (12:15 AM with the scene), the lack of a photo between those times implies no loud noises occurred then. Therefore, Larry's Testimony 5 is contradicted by the camera not taking a photo at the time he claims. Hence, Evidence 2 (the camera's function) and Testimony 5. But how does the camera's function directly contradict the testimony? The camera is supposed to take photos when there's a loud noise. If Larry heard a gunshot (loud noise) at almost midnight, the camera should have taken a photo then, but there's none. Therefore, the camera's presence (Evidence 2) and its functionality contradict his Testimony 5. So the correct pair is Evidence 2 and Testimony 5. But let me check again. The problem is that the camera's photos are Evidence 4 and 16. The camera (Evidence 2) is set to take photos on loud noises. If a gunshot happened at almost midnight, there should be a photo then. But there's no such photo. Therefore, the absence of a photo (not an evidence listed) contradicts Testimony 5. However, the only evidence available are the photos taken. So the contradiction is between Testimony 5 and the absence of a photo at midnight. But since we can't reference absence, perhaps the existing photo (Evidence 4) taken at 12:15 AM shows that the gunshot occurred then, which is after Larry's claimed time. Therefore, Evidence 4 contradicts Testimony 5. Alternatively, Lotta's Deposition (Evidence 11) states she heard the gunshots after midnight, which aligns with Evidence 4. So Larry's Testimony 5 (before midnight) contradicts Evidence 11 and 4. But the question asks for one pair. The strongest contradiction is between Testimony 5 (gunshot at almost midnight) and Evidence 4 (photo taken at 12:15 AM), as the photo's timestamp indicates the gunshot happened then. Therefore, the answer is {"evidence": 4, "testimony": 5}.

Alternatively, the camera's setup (Evidence 2) which triggers on loud noise and the lack of a photo at midnight (only at 12:15) contradicts Larry's Testimony 5. So Evidence 2 and Testimony 5. But since the camera's existence and function is Evidence 2, and the testimony is about a loud noise, the contradiction is that the camera should have captured it but didn't. Therefore, Evidence 2 (the camera's presence) and Testimony 5. But the user may want the actual photo that shows the time, which is Evidence 4. Hmm. This is tricky. In the Ace Attorney games, such contradictions often hinge on the timestamps of photos and testimonies. For example, if a witness claims an event happened at a certain time, but a photo shows it happened later, that's a contradiction. Here, Larry says he heard the gunshot at almost midnight (24th), but the camera's photo (Evidence 4) is taken at 12:15 AM (25th), indicating the gunshot happened then. Therefore, Evidence 4 contradicts Testimony 5. So the answer should be {"evidence":4,"testimony":5}.

{"evidence": 4, "testimony": 5}

Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. So, first, I need to look through the testimonies given by Dhurke and check them against the evidences provided.

Looking at the testimonies from Dhurke, Testimony 5 says he doesn't have a motive because he seeks a bloodless revolution. But maybe there's evidence that shows he does have a motive. Let's check the evidences.

Evidence 19 is the Pink Butterfly Pendant, which is stained with the victim's blood and actually belongs to Amara. Wait, but how does that relate? Maybe if Dhurke has a connection to Amara, that could be a motive. Also, Evidence 23 is a photo of Dhurke and Amara from 23 years ago, showing a book with the Defiant Dragons logo. That suggests a long-standing connection, but maybe that's not directly a motive against Inga.

Another angle: Testimony 2 says the possibility of a third party in the tomb is nonexistent. But maybe some evidence suggests there was someone else. For example, Evidence 25 is Ahlbi's statement about Shah'do being startled by a firecracker around 2 PM, which made Nayna lose her hat. But Inga's time of death is 3 PM according to Evidence 15. Hmm, maybe not directly related.

Wait, Evidence 20 is a bloodstain from the tomb that's Dhurke's blood, but he says he didn't kill Inga. However, the bloodstain was wiped up, which might indicate someone else tried to clean up. But that's not a direct contradiction.

Looking back at Testimony 5: Dhurke claims no motive. But Evidence 27 is Dhurke's Law Book, which establishes the Defense Culpability Act in the queen's name. If Inga was opposing this, maybe there's a motive. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, Evidence 27 might show Dhurke's political motives against the current regime, which Inga was part of. So that could contradict his statement about having no motive. That seems possible.

Wait, Evidence 27 is a law book establishing the Defense Culpability Act in the queen's name. If Dhurke was involved in creating laws that oppose the current government (Ga'ran and Inga), then he might have a motive to eliminate Inga, who is the Minister of Justice. So Testimony 5 (no motive) vs Evidence 27 (his involvement in legislation opposing the current regime) could be a contradiction. That would mean Dhurke does have a motive, which contradicts his testimony.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 2 where he says no third party could be in the tomb. But Evidence 19 is the pendant belonging to Amara, but found at the scene. If Amara is supposed to be dead, but maybe she's alive, or someone else used her pendant. Wait, the pendant is a locket found at the crime scene. If Amara is involved, perhaps she was there. But according to Evidence 26, Amara's assassination file exists, suggesting she was thought to be dead. But in Evidence 18, there's a gemstone (Inga's button) in the ashes. Maybe someone else was present. However, Dhurke's testimony 2 says no third party, but if there's evidence of another person, like Nayna (Character 16) who disappeared, perhaps that's a contradiction. But how does that tie in?

Alternatively, Testimony 0: Dhurke says he was struck by dizziness upon entering the tomb. Evidence 21 is painkiller shots used by Inga. If the painkillers could have caused dizziness or if someone drugged him, but not sure. Or Evidence 20, the bloodstain being Dhurke's, but he claims he didn't kill Inga, but his blood is there. But he was injured, so maybe that's expected. Hmm.

Wait, Testimony 3 says Dhurke found Inga dead in front of him. But the autopsy report (Evidence 15) says Inga died at 3 PM. The Channeling Photo (Evidence 24) is at 2 PM, and Ahlbi's statement (Evidence 25) about 2 PM events. If the timeline allows for someone else to be there, but Dhurke says no third party. Wait, maybe the tomb was supposed to be sealed, but if there's a way in, like a secret passage? Not sure.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 6: Dhurke says he didn't kill Inga, but Evidence 19 (the pendant) has his blood. Wait, no, Evidence 19 is the pendant stained with the victim's blood and belongs to Amara. The bloodstain in Evidence 20 is Dhurke's blood. So if his blood is at the scene, but he claims he didn't do it, that might indicate someone else was there. But he says there's no third party (Testimony 2). So if his blood is there and he was present, but he claims no third party, but his own presence is already accounted for. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 2 (no third party) and Evidence 20 (Dhurke's bloodstain that was wiped). If someone wiped the bloodstain, that implies a third party was there to clean it up. Because Dhurke was in the tomb, but if he was unconscious (from Testimony 0, dizziness), then someone else could have wiped the blood. Therefore, Testimony 2 (no third party) contradicts Evidence 20 (wiped bloodstain, suggesting someone else was there).

But the question is to find a pair where the evidence directly contradicts the testimony. So, if Dhurke says no third party could be present (Testimony 2), but the bloodstain was wiped by someone else, that would mean a third party was present. Therefore, Evidence 20 contradicts Testimony 2. So the answer would be evidence 20 and testimony 2.

Alternatively, Evidence 23: the photo showing a Defiant Dragons book in the background. If that's from 23 years ago, and the Defiant Dragons are still active, maybe that's not a direct contradiction. Or maybe Evidence 27, the law book, which shows Dhurke's involvement in legal changes, which might give him a motive against Inga, contradicting Testimony 5.

So the possible pairs are:

- Testimony 2 (no third party) vs Evidence 20 (wiped bloodstain, implying third party)

- Testimony 5 (no motive) vs Evidence 27 (Dhurke's law book, showing motive)

Which is more direct?

Testimony 5: Dhurke says he has no motive because he's for a bloodless revolution. Evidence 27 is the law book establishing the Defense Culpability Act in the queen's name. If this act is part of his revolution, and Inga as Minister of Justice opposed it, then Dhurke would have a motive to eliminate Inga. Therefore, Evidence 27 contradicts Testimony 5, showing that Dhurke does have a motive, which he denies.

Alternatively, Evidence 19: the pendant belongs to Amara, who is the previous queen. If Amara is alive or Dhurke has ties to her, perhaps that's a motive. But how does that directly contradict the testimony?

Hmm. Let me check the specifics. Testimony 5: "I don't have a motive for killing Inga. After all, me and my ilk seek a bloodless revolution."

But if Evidence 27 is a law book that Dhurke created, which would undermine Inga's position, then that could be a motive. So this evidence would show that Dhurke is actively working against the current regime (which Inga is part of), thus providing a motive. Therefore, Testimony 5 is contradicted by Evidence 27.

So the correct pair would be evidence 27 and testimony 5.

{"evidence": 27, "testimony": 5}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence contradicts which testimony. Let me start by going through the testimonies and evidences one by one.

First, the testimonies from Rayfa. Testimony 0 says she was gazing at the courtyard from her second-floor veranda on the day of the murder. Testimony 1 mentions her seeing her father (Inga) heading to Amara's Tomb around 2:30 PM. Testimony 2 says her father screamed and ran out of his room with a pale face. Testimony 3 states that she had been watching the courtyard since about 2 PM and only saw her father. Testimony 4 mentions seeing "Barbed Head and company" enter the courtyard around 2:45 PM. Testimony 5 claims she saw no one enter or exit the tomb after her father entered at 2:30 PM.

Now, looking at the evidences. Evidence 25 is Ahlbi's Statement, which says that around 2 PM, Shah'do (a dog?) was startled by a firecracker, ran into the courtyard, spooked Nayna and stole her hat. If Rayfa was watching the courtyard from 2 PM onwards and only saw her father, then according to her Testimony 3, she should not have seen Shah'do or the incident with Nayna. But Ahlbi's Statement (Evidence 25) mentions this happening around 2 PM. So there's a contradiction here. Rayfa says she saw no one else, but Ahlbi's statement suggests that there was activity involving Shah'do and Nayna in the courtyard around the same time. Therefore, Evidence 25 contradicts Testimony 3.

{"evidence": 25, "testimony": 3}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the user wants to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. They provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. Let me go through each to spot contradictions.

First, I'll look at the testimonies. Testimony 3 from Nayna states: "After Queen Amara's passing, Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran is the only spirit medium left." That suggests that Ga'ran is the sole remaining medium after Amara's death.

Now, checking the evidence. Evidence 23 is a photo showing Dhurke and Amara from 23 years ago. The caption mentions that Amara is holding a baby, and there's a book with the Defiant Dragons logo. The note in the evidence says, "The Defiant Dragons was formed after Amara's assassination." Wait, if the Defiant Dragons were formed after Amara's assassination, but the photo is from 23 years ago showing Amara alive, that implies Amara was assassinated later. However, according to the testimony, Ga'ran became the only medium after Amara's passing. But Evidence 26 (Amara's Assassination File) might have more info, but let's focus on the given pair.

Wait, Evidence 23's caption says the Defiant Dragons was formed after Amara's assassination, but the photo is from 23 years ago with Amara alive. So the formation of the Defiant Dragons would be after that photo. However, if the testimony says Ga'ran is the only medium left after Amara's death, but Evidence 19 (Pink Butterfly Pendant) is a locket belonging to Amara. Hmm, maybe another angle.

Wait, Testimony 3 says Ga'ran is the only medium left after Amara's death. But Evidence 23's note says the Defiant Dragons formed after Amara's assassination. But if the photo in Evidence 23 shows Amara alive, then her assassination must have happened after the photo was taken. But according to the testimony, after Amara's death, Ga'ran is the only medium. But Evidence 18 (Amara Sigatar Khura'in) is the previous queen, and she's a spirit medium. Wait, but in the characters list, Amara is the previous queen, and Ga'ran is the current queen. So if Amara was assassinated, then Ga'ran took over. But Testimony 3 says Ga'ran is the only medium left. However, Maya Fey (Character 12/27) can also channel the dead. So maybe that's a contradiction. But the testimony mentions that in Khura'in, only royal family members can learn spirit channeling. Wait, Testimony 2 says "Only members of the royal family can learn the art of spirit channeling here in Khura'in." So Maya Fey is from Kurain Village, which is a different place (Kurain vs. Khura'in?), so maybe she's not considered a royal member in Khura'in. But the contradiction here is between Testimony 3 (Ga'ran is the only medium after Amara's death) and Evidence 23's note. Wait, no. Let me re-examine.

Wait, Evidence 23 is a photo from 23 years ago showing Amara alive and a book with the Defiant Dragons logo. The note says the Defiant Dragons was formed after Amara's assassination. But if the photo is from 23 years ago and the Defiant Dragons formed after her assassination, which would be later, then the presence of the logo in the photo (from 23 years ago) contradicts the note. That seems like a contradiction within the evidence itself, but the question is about evidence vs. testimony.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 3: "After Queen Amara's passing, Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran is the only spirit medium left." But Evidence 19 is the Pink Butterfly Pendant, which is a locket found at the crime scene that actually belongs to Amara. If Amara's pendant is there, perhaps suggesting she's still around, but according to the testimony, she's dead. However, if Amara is dead, but the locket is hers, that's not a contradiction. Unless the pendant's presence implies she was channeled. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: Testimony 3 says Ga'ran is the only medium after Amara's death. But Evidence 15 is Ga'ran's description, stating she can channel the dead, which aligns. However, Maya Fey (Character 12/27) can also channel the dead. But according to Testimony 4, Nayna says if there's a medium culprit, it would be Maya Fey, implying she's a medium. But Testimony 2 says only royal family members in Khura'in can learn channeling. So Maya isn't from the royal family, so how can she be a medium? That might be a contradiction, but that's between testimonies and character info, not evidence.

Wait, the user is looking for a pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other. Let's check Evidence 23 again. The note says ["The Defiant Dragons was formed after Amara's assassination."] But the photo shows Amara alive 23 years ago, and the Defiant Dragons' logo is on a book in the background. If the Defiant Dragons formed after Amara's assassination, but the book in the photo (taken 23 years ago) already has their logo, that would mean the group existed before Amara's assassination. That contradicts the note in the evidence. But that's internal to the evidence. However, the testimony in question is Testimony 3 about Ga'ran being the only medium. How does that connect?

Alternatively, Testimony 3 claims Ga'ran is the only medium after Amara's death, but Evidence 19 (the pendant) is actually Amara's. If Amara's spirit is channeled, then there's another medium. But the testimony says Ga'ran is the only one. If Amara's pendant is present, perhaps indicating she was channeled, then someone else (like Maya) must have done it, contradicting the testimony. But how does the evidence tie in?

Wait, Evidence 24 is the Channeling Photo taken at around 2 PM. If that photo shows someone else channeling (like Amara), then Testimony 3 would be contradicted. But I don't have the details of Evidence 24's description. The description says "A picture taken at around 2 PM of the channeling rite." If the channeling rite involved Amara, then that would imply someone else (like Maya) channeled her, contradicting Testimony 3. But that's speculation.

Alternatively, Evidence 26 (Amara's Assassination File) might have information that she was assassinated, but if the Defiant Dragons were formed after that, and the photo in Evidence 23 shows the logo before the assassination, that's a contradiction. But how does this tie into a testimony?

Wait, Testimony 3 says after Amara's passing, Ga'ran is the only medium. But if Amara's assassination happened, and the Defiant Dragons formed after, but Evidence 23's photo from 23 years ago shows the logo, which would imply the group existed before her assassination. This would contradict the note in Evidence 23. But how does this relate to a testimony?

Hmm, perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (Ga'ran is the only medium after Amara's death) and Evidence 23's note stating that the Defiant Dragons formed after Amara's assassination. If the Defiant Dragons were formed after Amara's death, but the photo from 23 years ago (when Amara was alive) shows their logo, then the group must have existed before her assassination, which contradicts the note. But how does that connect to the testimony? The testimony is about mediums, not the Defiant Dragons.

Wait, perhaps the key is in Evidence 23's note: ["The Defiant Dragons was formed after Amara's assassination."]. If that's the case, but the photo from 23 years ago (when Amara was still alive) already shows a book with their logo, that would mean the group existed before her assassination, contradicting the note. However, this is a contradiction within the evidence itself, not between evidence and testimony.

Wait, maybe I should look elsewhere. Let's consider Testimony 3 again. If Ga'ran is the only medium after Amara's death, but Evidence 19 is the pendant that belongs to Amara, found at the crime scene. If Amara's pendant is there, maybe it's because she was channeled, implying another medium exists. But according to Testimony 3, that's impossible. So Evidence 19 (Amara's pendant) being present contradicts Testimony 3, suggesting someone else channeled her. However, the pendant being there doesn't necessarily mean she was channeled. It could have been left behind earlier.

Alternatively, let's look at Evidence 19: the pendant is actually Amara's, and it's stained with the victim's blood. If Amara is dead, how did her pendant get there? Unless she was channeled, which would require a medium. If the testimony says Ga'ran is the only medium, but the pendant suggests Amara was present (via channeling), then that's a contradiction. But the pendant could have been taken from her when she was alive, so maybe not. Hmm.

Another angle: Testimony 3 says after Amara's death, only Ga'ran can channel. But Evidence 18 is Amara's description as a spirit medium. If Amara is dead, but her spirit could be channeled, then someone else must have done it. But according to Testimony 3, only Ga'ran can. So if there's evidence that Amara was channeled, that would contradict. But which evidence shows that? Maybe the Channeling Photo (Evidence 24) shows Amara being channeled. If the photo is from a channeling rite where Amara was present, then the medium would have to be someone else, contradicting Testimony 3. But the user needs to pick one pair. Let me check Evidence 24's description: "A picture taken at around 2 PM of the channeling rite." If this photo shows Amara being channeled, then the medium isn't Ga'ran, which would contradict Testimony 3. But without more info, it's hard to say. Alternatively, Evidence 24 could be related to the current case's timing.

Alternatively, let's look at Evidence 25: Ahlbi's Statement says that at around 2 PM, Shah'do was startled by a firecracker, ran into the courtyard, spooked Nayna, and stole her hat. If Nayna was present there, but her Testimony 0 says she was resting under the weather yesterday, maybe there's a contradiction. Wait, Testimony 0 is Nayna saying she was resting yesterday. If the statement in Evidence 25 is from the same day, then that's a contradiction. But I need to check the dates. However, the user hasn't provided timeline details, so maybe not.

Wait, focusing back on Testimony 3 and Evidence 23. Testimony 3 states that after Amara's death, Ga'ran is the only medium. But Evidence 23's photo shows Amara alive 23 years ago with a Defiant Dragons book. The note says the Defiant Dragons formed after Amara's assassination. If the Defiant Dragons were formed after her assassination, but the photo from 23 years ago (when she was alive) already shows their logo, that's a contradiction. But how does that relate to Testimony 3? If the Defiant Dragons were formed after Amara's death, but the group existed while she was alive, then the note in Evidence 23 is wrong, but the testimony about mediums is separate.

Maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (Ga'ran is the only medium) and Evidence 19 (the pendant belonging to Amara, found at the scene). If Amara's pendant is there, it might imply she was channeled, requiring another medium. But the testimony says Ga'ran is the only one, so this would contradict. Therefore, Evidence 19 and Testimony 3.

Wait, Evidence 19's description: "A locket found at the crime scene. It actually belongs to Amara." If Amara is dead, how did her locket get there unless someone channeled her and the locket was brought along? But if only Ga'ran can channel, then she must have done it. But if Ga'ran is the queen, would she be involved? Alternatively, the locket might have been stolen or kept by someone else. Not sure.

Alternatively, let's consider Evidence 26: Amara's Assassination File. If the file states that she was assassinated, but the Defiant Dragons formed after, as per Evidence 23's note, then the photo in Evidence 23 (showing Defiant Dragons logo while she was alive) contradicts that note. But again, that's internal to the evidence.

Hmm. Maybe the answer is Evidence 23 and Testimony 3. Because Testimony 3 says Ga'ran is the only medium after Amara's death. But Evidence 23's photo shows Amara alive with a Defiant Dragons book, which according to the note, the group formed after her assassination. If the group was formed after her death, but the photo from when she was alive already has their logo, that suggests the group existed before her death, contradicting the note. But how does that relate to the testimony? Maybe the testimony is about the mediums, and the evidence's note is about the Defiant Dragons' formation, which are different aspects. So maybe not the right pair.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 24 (Channeling Photo). If the photo shows a channeling that includes Amara, then someone other than Ga'ran must have done it, contradicting Testimony 3. But without more details on Evidence 24, it's hard to say. The description just says it's a photo of the channeling rite. If that rite involved Amara, then yes. But maybe the photo is of Ga'ran channeling, which would align.

Alternatively, Evidence 19's pendant being Amara's and found at the scene might mean she was channeled there. If so, then the medium would have to be someone other than Ga'ran, contradicting Testimony 3. But the testimony says Ga'ran is the only one. So Evidence 19 contradicts Testimony 3. Thus, the pair would be Evidence 19 and Testimony 3.

Alternatively, Evidence 23's note says the Defiant Dragons formed after Amara's assassination. If the photo from 23 years ago (when Amara was alive) shows their logo, then the group existed before her death, contradicting the note. But this is an internal contradiction in the evidence, not between evidence and testimony.

Wait, perhaps the correct pair is Evidence 23 and Testimony 3. Because the Defiant Dragons being formed after Amara's assassination (Evidence 23's note) but the photo shows the logo when she was alive. But how does that relate to the testimony about mediums? Maybe the testimony is indirectly connected. For example, if the Defiant Dragons were formed after Amara's death, then Dhurke (their leader) could not have been involved with them while she was alive. But if the photo shows him with the logo when she was alive, that contradicts. But again, this is about the group's formation, not the mediums.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try to approach this systematically.

First, list all testimonies and see which ones can be contradicted by evidence.

Testimony 3: After Amara's death, Ga'ran is the only medium.

Which evidence would contradict this? Any evidence showing that there's another medium, like Maya Fey channeling someone, or Amara's spirit being present.

Evidence 24: Channeling Photo taken at 2 PM. If this photo shows Maya channeling Amara, then Testimony 3 is contradicted. But the description doesn't specify.

Evidence 19: Amara's pendant found at the scene. If Amara's spirit was there, that would require a medium. But according to Testimony 3, only Ga'ran can do that. If Ga'ran wasn't the one, then contradiction.

But how do we know? If the pendant is there, it might not directly imply channeling. Maybe it was left behind when Amara was alive.

Alternatively, Evidence 26: Amara's Assassination File. If the file states she was assassinated, but the Defiant Dragons formed after, and the photo (Evidence 23) shows the group's logo before her death, that's a contradiction. But again, not directly related to the testimony.

Wait, Testimony 3 says that after Amara's passing, Ga'ran is the only medium left. But if Amara was assassinated, and the Defiant Dragons formed after, but the photo shows Dhurke and Amara with the Defiant Dragons logo when she was alive, that suggests the group existed before her assassination. This would mean the note in Evidence 23 is wrong, but how does that affect the testimony? It doesn't directly.

Perhaps the answer is Evidence 23 and Testimony 3. Because the note in Evidence 23 says the Defiant Dragons formed after Amara's assassination, but the photo shows them existing while she was alive. However, the testimony is about mediums, not the Defiant Dragons. So maybe not.

Alternatively, the contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 19. Testimony 3 says Ga'ran is the only medium after Amara's death. Evidence 19's pendant is Amara's, found at the scene. If the pendant was brought there by channeling Amara's spirit, then another medium exists. But unless there's evidence of channeling, this is speculative.

Alternatively, let's look at Testimony 4: Nayna says if the culprit is a medium, it's Maya Fey. But Testimony 2 says only royal family members can learn channeling in Khura'in. Maya is from Kurain Village, not Khura'in royalty. So how can she be a medium there? That would contradict Testimony 2. But the user is asking for evidence and testimony contradiction. So if there's evidence that Maya is a medium in Khura'in, that would contradict Testimony 2. For example, Evidence 12 (Maya Fey's description) says she can channel the dead. But in the characters list, Maya is described as being able to channel. So Testimony 2 (only royal family can) vs. Maya's ability. But the user's question is about evidence and testimony, so the evidence would be Maya's character info. However, the evidence list doesn't include character descriptions as evidence. The evidences are separate items.

Ah, wait, the user provided Characters, Evidences, and Testimonies. The Evidences are numbered 0-32. The testimonies are 0-4. The characters are just for context.

So the contradiction must be between an evidence item (0-32) and a testimony (0-4).

Looking back, perhaps Evidence 23's note states that the Defiant Dragons formed after Amara's assassination, but the photo from 23 years ago shows the logo, implying they existed before. The testimony in question is Testimony 3: Ga'ran is the only medium after Amara's death. How does this connect?

Wait, if the Defiant Dragons formed after Amara's assassination, but the photo shows them existing while she was alive, this might mean that Amara's assassination happened more recently, and the Defiant Dragons were formed then. But the photo is from 23 years ago. If Amara was assassinated after that photo, then the Defiant Dragons formed after, but the photo shows the logo before, implying the group existed before her assassination. This contradicts the note in Evidence 23. But how does this relate to Testimony 3?

Perhaps the assassination of Amara happened later, and the Defiant Dragons were formed in response. But if the photo shows the logo earlier, that's a problem. But this is internal to the evidence.

I think I'm overcomplicating. The most likely answer is Evidence 23's note contradicts Testimony 3. Wait, the note says the Defiant Dragons was formed after Amara's assassination, but the photo shows the logo when she was alive. So the group existed before her assassination. But the testimony is about mediums. Perhaps the connection is that if the Defiant Dragons were formed after her death, but Dhurke was raising Apollo (as per character 4), which might imply a timeline issue. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe Evidence 19's pendant belonging to Amara and being found at the scene implies she was channeled, requiring another medium, contradicting Testimony 3. So the pair would be Evidence 19 and Testimony 3. That seems plausible.

{"evidence": 23, "testimony": 3}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. So, first, I need to look through all the testimonies given by Amara and check them against the evidence provided.

Amara's testimonies are Testimony 0 to 5. Let's go through them one by one.

Testimony 3 says: "Minister Inga was the sole victim. There was no other spirit to channel until he was dead." So she's claiming that Inga was the only person killed, and thus no other spirits existed before his death. But looking at the evidence, there's Evidence 19, the Pink Butterfly Pendant, which is a locket found at the crime scene that actually belongs to Amara and is stained with Dhurke's blood. Also, Evidence 20 is a bloodstain from the tomb that's Dhurke's blood. Then there's Evidence 29, which is a photo of Dhurke's corpse showing he was shot three times and died more than three days prior. Wait, if Dhurke's already dead, then his spirit would have been around before Inga's death. But Amara says Inga was the sole victim and no other spirits existed until he died. That contradicts because Dhurke's death would have occurred before Inga's, so his spirit should have been available for channeling before Inga's death. Therefore, Testimony 3 is contradicted by Evidence 29 (Dhurke's Corpse Photo), which proves Dhurke was already dead, so his spirit would have been present before Inga's death. That means there was another spirit (Dhurke's) to channel before Inga's death, which contradicts Amara's Testimony 3. So the pair would be Evidence 29 and Testimony 3.

{"evidence": 29, "testimony": 3}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure this out. I need to find which evidence contradicts one of Amara's testimonies. Let's look at the testimonies first.

Amara's testimonies (Testimony 0 to 5) are all about her denying involvement in Inga's murder. Specifically, Testimony 3 says, "There is nothing to prove I was even at the scene of the crime." So she's claiming she wasn't present at the crime scene. But maybe there's evidence that shows she was there.

Looking through the evidence list, let's see. Evidence 23 is a Woman's Photo: a photo of Dhurke and Amara from 23 years ago. The caption mentions that Amara is holding a baby, and one of the books in the background has the Defiant Dragons logo. Hmm, not sure how that connects to her being at the scene of Inga's murder. 

Evidence 19 is the Pink Butterfly Pendant. It says it's a locket found at the crime scene, actually belonging to Amara. Oh! If her pendant was found at the crime scene, that directly places her there, contradicting her testimony that there's nothing proving she was present. 

But wait, the pendant is listed as Evidence 19. Also, the description says it's stained with the victim's blood. So if Amara's pendant is found at the scene with the victim's blood, that's solid proof she was there. Therefore, Testimony 3 (where she says there's no proof she was at the scene) is contradicted by Evidence 19 (her pendant found there). 

Let me check again. Testimony 3: "There is nothing to prove I was even at the scene of the crime." Evidence 19: Pink Butterfly Pendant belonging to Amara found at the crime scene. Yes, that's a direct contradiction. So the correct pair is evidence 19 and testimony 3.

{"evidence": 19, "testimony": 3}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence contradicts one of the testimonies given by Nahyuta. The characters, evidences, and testimonies are all from the Ace Attorney universe, probably from Spirit of Justice.

First, let me look through the testimonies provided by Nahyuta. Testimony 3 says: "I consider it divine judgment cast upon a fiend who sought to assassinate our monarch." So Nahyuta is justifying Inga's murder by saying Inga tried to assassinate the monarch. But which monarch? The current queen is Ga'ran, but maybe Amara is the previous queen. 

Looking at the evidence, let's check Evidence 26: Amara's Assassination File. That's a file about the assassination of Amara. If Inga was involved in Amara's assassination, then maybe that's the context. But according to Testimony 5, Nahyuta says he was reunited with his mother Queen Amara 15 years ago when Dhurke abducted her. Wait, so Amara is Nahyuta's mother and was thought to be dead, but actually was in hiding. But if Inga tried to assassinate her, but according to Evidence 26, Amara's assassination happened. Maybe that's a contradiction.

Wait, Testimony 3 says Inga sought to assassinate the monarch. If Amara was the previous queen and Inga tried to assassinate her, but the current monarch is Ga'ran. However, the file in Evidence 26 is about Amara's assassination. So if Inga was involved in that, then Testimony 3's claim that Inga tried to assassinate the monarch (maybe Amara) would align. But perhaps there's a contradiction here. Wait, but Evidence 19: Pink Butterfly Pendant is a locket found at the crime scene, belonging to Amara, and the photo in Evidence 23 shows Amara with Dhurke. 

Wait, but Testimony 5 says that Nahyuta was reunited with Amara 15 years ago when Dhurke abducted her. That suggests that Amara was alive and in hiding. But if there's an assassination file on Amara, maybe the official story is that she was assassinated, but actually she survived. So Inga's assassination attempt might have been part of that. 

But Testimony 3 says that Inga sought to assassinate "our monarch." If Amara was the monarch at the time, but now Ga'ran is the queen. So if Inga tried to assassinate Amara (the then-monarch), then Testimony 3 would be correct. However, the contradiction could come from elsewhere. Let me check other evidence.

Looking at Evidence 15: Inga's Autopsy Report. He was stabbed from behind, time of death around 3 PM. Testimony 0-5 are all from Nahyuta. Testimony 5 says he was reunited with his mother Amara 15 years ago when Dhurke abducted her. Wait, but if Amara is alive, then the assassination file in Evidence 26 might be a cover-up. So if Nahyuta is saying that Inga tried to assassinate the monarch (Amara), but Amara is actually alive, then perhaps there's a contradiction. But how does that connect to the evidence?

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 5, where Nahyuta says he was reunited with Amara 15 years ago when Dhurke abducted her. But if Amara was supposed to have been assassinated earlier, perhaps that's conflicting. Let me check Evidence 26 again. Amara's Assassination File contains info on her assassination. If Amara was assassinated, then how is she alive now? Unless the assassination was faked, which would mean the file is part of the cover-up. But if the file in Evidence 26 shows that Inga was involved in her assassination, but Testimony 5 says Amara was abducted by Dhurke 15 years ago (so she survived), that could be a contradiction. Wait, but if Amara was abducted 15 years ago, but the assassination attempt was earlier, maybe that's possible. Hmm, maybe this is not the contradiction.

Another angle: Testimony 3 says that Inga tried to assassinate the monarch. If the current monarch is Ga'ran, but Inga's target was Amara, then perhaps the contradiction is that Inga's target wasn't the current monarch. But Testimony 3 refers to "our monarch" which could be Ga'ran. So if Inga tried to kill Ga'ran, but the evidence shows he was involved in Amara's assassination, that's a contradiction. Wait, Evidence 26 is about Amara's assassination. If Testimony 3 claims Inga tried to kill the current monarch (Ga'ran), but the evidence shows he was involved in Amara's assassination (past monarch), then that's conflicting. 

Wait, but in Testimony 3, Nahyuta refers to Inga as a fiend who sought to assassinate "our monarch." If the current monarch is Ga'ran, then Inga's assassination attempt would be against her. But if Evidence 26's file shows Inga was involved in Amara's assassination, then Nahyuta's testimony would be incorrect. So the contradiction would be between Testimony 3 (claiming Inga tried to kill Ga'ran) and Evidence 26 (showing he tried to kill Amara). But I need to confirm who the current monarch is. From the character descriptions: Ga'ran is the queen (Character 15 and 30), and Amara is the previous queen (Character 18). So if Testimony 3 says Inga tried to assassinate the current monarch (Ga'ran), but the evidence shows he was involved in Amara's assassination (past monarch), then that's a contradiction. 

Alternatively, maybe the assassination file is about a successful assassination, but Amara is alive, so the file is a lie, which would mean Inga didn't actually assassinate her. But if Nahyuta's Testimony 3 says that Inga tried to assassinate the monarch (Ga'ran), but the file in Evidence 26 is about Amara's assassination, which was a fake, then the contradiction is that Inga was involved in a fake assassination, not the current one. 

Alternatively, maybe Testimony 5: Nahyuta says he was reunited with Amara 15 years ago when Dhurke abducted her. If Amara is alive, then the assassination file in Evidence 26 is a false report. But Inga's assassination attempt on Amara would have failed. However, Testimony 3 says Inga sought to assassinate the monarch (current one, Ga'ran). If Evidence 26 is about Amara's assassination, then Inga's target was a former monarch, not the current one. So Nahyuta's testimony is incorrect because Inga was involved in a past assassination, not the current monarch. Therefore, Testimony 3 is contradicted by Evidence 26. 

So the pair would be Evidence 26 and Testimony 3. But wait, Evidence 26 is about Amara's assassination, while Testimony 3 says Inga sought to kill the current monarch. So that's a contradiction. 

Alternatively, another possibility: Testimony 5 says that Nahyuta was reunited with his mother Amara 15 years ago when Dhurke abducted her. But if Amara was supposed to have been assassinated earlier, then her being alive is a contradiction. But maybe the assassination was a cover-up. However, Evidence 26 is a file on her assassination. If she's alive, then the assassination was faked. So perhaps Inga was involved in the fake assassination. But Testimony 3 says Inga tried to assassinate the monarch (Ga'ran). If the file shows he was involved in Amara's assassination, then the contradiction is that Inga's target was Amara, not Ga'ran. Therefore, Testimony 3 is false because Inga's target wasn't the current monarch. 

Thus, Evidence 26 (Amara's Assassination File) contradicts Testimony 3 (Nahyuta's claim that Inga sought to assassinate the monarch, i.e., Ga'ran). Therefore, the correct pair is evidence 26 and testimony 3.

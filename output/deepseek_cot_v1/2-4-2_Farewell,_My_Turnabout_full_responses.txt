Okay, let's start by looking through the evidence and testimonies provided. The goal is to find a contradiction between one piece of evidence and one testimony. 

First, let's recall the testimonies from Gumshoe. Testimony 4 states that the defendant's (Matt Engarde) fingerprints were on the knife. Testimony 5 claims that Engarde bought the knife, making it premeditated murder. The evidence related to the knife is Evidence 15, which mentions the knife has Engarde's fingerprints and is engraved with "Gatewater Hotel".

Wait, but there's also Evidence 24, which is a credit card receipt showing Engarde bought a stuffed bear. The spy camera (Evidence 21, 22, 23) was in a stuffed bear, and the receipt shows he bought an identical one. So maybe the knife's origin is important here. The knife is engraved with "Gatewater", but if the receipt is for a bear, not the knife, then Testimony 5 says he bought the knife, but the receipt is for a bear. That would be a contradiction. Because Testimony 5 claims Engarde bought the knife, but Evidence 24 shows he bought a stuffed bear. So the receipt doesn't support that he bought the knife, contradicting Testimony 5. 

Alternatively, looking at the knife's fingerprints: Testimony 4 says Engarde's fingerprints are on the knife. But Evidence 15 says the knife has Engarde's fingerprints. So that's consistent. Wait, no contradiction there. But maybe the real contradiction is elsewhere. 

Another angle: The autopsy report (Evidence 14) says the cause of death was strangulation with a scarf, then stabbed. But the knife is presented as the murder weapon. However, the actual cause of death was strangulation first. So the stabbing was post-mortem. Therefore, the knife might not be the actual murder weapon. But how does this relate to the testimonies? The testimonies focus on the knife as the murder weapon. So if the cause of death was strangulation, then the knife's role is secondary. But that's more about the cause of death vs. the evidence presented, not directly a testimony contradiction. 

Wait, Testimony 5 says that Engarde bought the knife, making it premeditated. But Evidence 15's knife has "Gatewater" engraved. If the knife is from the hotel, maybe Engarde didn't buy it. The receipt (Evidence 24) is for a stuffed bear, not the knife. Therefore, Testimony 5 claims he bought the knife, but the evidence shows he bought a bear. So there's a contradiction here. 

So the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (Engarde bought the knife) and Evidence 24 (he bought a stuffed bear). But Evidence 24 is the credit card receipt for the bear. The knife's origin isn't directly tied to a purchase by Engarde. Therefore, Testimony 5's claim that he bought the knife is contradicted by Evidence 24, which shows he bought a bear instead. Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 24 and Testimony 5. 

But wait, let me check the exact details again. Testimony 5: "The defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!" Evidence 24 is a receipt for a stuffed bear. So the testimony claims he bought the knife, but the evidence shows he bought a bear. Therefore, the testimony's assertion about purchasing the knife is not supported by the receipt. Hence, they contradict each other. 

Therefore, the correct pair is Evidence 24 and Testimony 5.

{"evidence": 24, "testimony": 5}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. They mentioned I should output one pair in JSON at the end. Let me start by going through the testimonies and evidences step by step.

First, looking at the testimonies provided by Oldbag. Testimony 3 and 4 say that Oldbag saw Matt Engarde coming out of Juan Corrida's room. Specifically, Testimony 4 states Engarde was wearing his flashy racing jacket, according to Testimony 5.

Now, checking the evidence related to this. The Crime Photo (Evidence 9) describes the victim in a samurai outfit. The Jammin' Ninja's Button (Evidence 16) was found in Engarde's hakama, which is part of a samurai costume. Also, the Nickel Samurai photo (Evidence 2) is a costume that Engarde's character wears. Additionally, Lotta's Photo (Evidence 17) shows a person in samurai garb outside the door after the murder. 

Wait, but Oldbag's testimony says Engarde was wearing a racing jacket. However, the evidence shows that the person involved was wearing a samurai outfit. The racing jacket and the samurai costume are different. If the person seen leaving was in samurai garb, then Oldbag's claim that it was Engarde in a racing jacket contradicts the photo evidence. But which evidence specifically contradicts which testimony?

Looking at Testimony 5: Oldbag says Engarde was wearing his flashy racing jacket. But Lotta's Photo (Evidence 17) shows a person in samurai garb outside the door at the time of the murder. So if the photo shows someone in samurai outfit, but Oldbag claims she saw Engarde in a racing jacket, that's a contradiction. Therefore, Evidence 17 (Lotta's Photo) contradicts Testimony 5 (Oldbag's statement about the jacket). But let me check the numbers again.

Evidence 17 is Lotta's Photo: a person in samurai garb outside the door. Testimony 5 is Oldbag saying Engarde was in a racing jacket. So that's a direct contradiction. Therefore, the correct pair would be evidence 17 and testimony 5.

Wait, but the question is to provide the evidence number and testimony number. Let me verify the indexes.

Looking back: Testimonies are numbered 0 to 5. Testimony 5 is the one about the racing jacket. Evidence 17 is Lotta's Photo. Yes. So the answer should be {"evidence": 17, "testimony": 5}.

{"evidence": 17, "testimony": 5}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence contradicts which testimony. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. The task is to find one pair where the evidence and testimony contradict each other.

First, let's look at the testimonies. All the testimonies from Testimony 0 to 4 are given by Oldbag (Security Lady). She's testifying about seeing the Nickel Samurai (Matt Engarde) committing the murder because he had to go to a stage show right after, so he was in costume.

Now, looking at the evidences. The key here is to check if any evidence shows that Matt Engarde couldn't have been in the costume during the murder, or that someone else was involved.

Testimony 4 by Oldbag says that Matt must have worn the Nickel Samurai costume when stabbing Juan. But looking at Evidence 16: Jammin' Ninja's Button. It was found in Engarde's "hakama" (which is part of the samurai costume). The Jammin' Ninja is Corrida's character. If Engarde's costume has a button from Corrida's costume, that suggests that there might have been a struggle or contact between them. However, the autopsy report (Evidence 14) says the cause of death was strangulation with a scarf and then stabbing. The knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints, but the button from Corrida's costume in Engarde's hakama could indicate that Engarde was present, but maybe another angle.

Wait, the contradiction might be elsewhere. Let's think about the timing. Testimony 3 says Engarde had to go to the post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, so he must have worn the costume. But the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was set to record the victim's room from 8 PM for 1 hour, which would cover the time of death at 8:15 PM. If the Spy Camera footage is considered, maybe it shows something conflicting with Oldbag's testimony. Alternatively, the Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows the victim in a samurai outfit. Wait, the victim is Juan Corrida, who played the Jammin' Ninja. So if the victim is in a samurai outfit, maybe the murderer was dressed as the Nickel Samurai (Engarde's character). But the button from the Jammin' Ninja (Corrida's character) in Engarde's costume suggests that Engarde was there. However, maybe the Video Tape (Evidence 29) from De Killer's hideout could show something else, but we don't know the contents.

Alternatively, consider the Guitar Case (Evidence 7). It was found next to the victim, empty, with water on the lid. The crime photo (Evidence 9) mentions the open guitar case and a smashed vase with water. If the guitar case was empty, maybe the weapon was hidden there, but the actual murder weapon was the knife with Engarde's prints. However, the autopsy says strangulation first. So the knife was used post-mortem. The knife has Engarde's fingerprints, but the real cause of death was strangulation. Maybe the contradiction is that the testimony claims Engarde stabbed him, but the autopsy says he was strangled first. But the testimony says "stabbing poor Juan," which is partially true, but the actual cause of death was strangulation. However, the testimony isn't necessarily wrong on the stabbing part, just incomplete.

Wait, Testimony 4 says he must have worn the costume when stabbing. But the murder method was strangulation. So stabbing was after death. So the stabbing might have been staged. The contradiction here could be that Oldbag's testimony focuses on the stabbing as the murder, but the autopsy shows that the actual cause of death was strangulation. But how does that contradict the testimony? The testimony is about the costume being worn during the stabbing, which might have happened after the murder. So the testimony's implication is that Engarde stabbed him to death, but the autopsy shows he was already dead from strangulation. Therefore, the stabbing was post-mortem, so the killer could have been someone else. But the knife has Engarde's fingerprints, so he was involved. Hmm.

Alternatively, looking at the Spy Camera (Evidence 21). If the camera was recording the room during the murder, and the footage might show something conflicting with Oldbag's claim. But we don't have the footage details. However, the Video Tape (Evidence 29) from De Killer's hideout could be the footage, but it's contents are unknown. Maybe that's not helpful.

Wait, the Security Lady (Oldbag) in Testimony 3 says Engarde had to go to the stage show right after the crime, so he wore the costume. But the Press Conference Ticket (Evidence 3) says the Nickel Samurai (Engarde) is to confess something after the post-ceremony stage show. If the stage show was after the crime, then Engarde would need to be there, implying he had an alibi. However, the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was recording from 8 PM, the time of death was 8:15 PM. If the stage show was at the same time, then Engarde couldn't be in two places at once. But that depends on the timing. Alternatively, maybe the stage show was scheduled for after 8:15 PM, so Engarde would have to be there, hence needing to wear the costume. But the Spy Camera's recording would show who was in the room during the murder. If the Spy Camera (in the stuffed bear, Evidence 23) was in the victim's room, then the footage might show the murderer. If the murderer was in the Nickel Samurai costume, then Oldbag's testimony aligns. However, if the footage shows someone else, that would contradict. But since the Video Tape's contents are unknown, we can't use that. Alternatively, maybe the stuffed bear was bought by Engarde (Evidence 24: Credit Card Receipt for a bear identical to the one in evidence), so he set up the spy camera. If Engarde set up the camera, then he might have planned the murder. But how does that contradict the testimony?

Another angle: The Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows the victim in a samurai outfit. The victim is Corrida, who is the Jammin' Ninja. The Jammin' Ninja's Button (Evidence 16) was found in Engarde's costume. If Engarde's costume has a button from Corrida's costume, that suggests they were in close contact. But the victim was in his own costume, so maybe during a struggle, the button was torn off. But if the murder happened in the victim's room, and the murderer was in the Nickel Samurai costume, then the button could have been transferred. But how does this contradict Oldbag's testimony?

Wait, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 3 and the Spy Camera. Testimony 3 says Engarde had to go to the stage show right after the crime, implying he was there. But the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was recording the victim's room from 8 PM, which includes the time of death at 8:15 PM. If the stage show was at 8 PM, Engarde would need to be there, making it impossible for him to be in the victim's room. But the testimony says "had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime". So the crime was committed before the stage show. If the stage show was scheduled after 8:15 PM, then Engarde could have committed the murder and then gone to the show. But if the Spy Camera's footage shows someone else in the room, that would contradict. However, without knowing the footage, maybe another angle.

Looking at Evidence 17: Lotta's Photo, which shows a person in samurai garb outside the door right after the murder. If that person was in the Nickel Samurai costume, that supports Oldbag's testimony. But if the photo shows a different time or contradicts the timeline, then maybe there's a contradiction.

Alternatively, the Autopsy Report (Evidence 14) states the time of death as 8:15 PM. The Press Conference Ticket (Evidence 3) says the stage show is after the post-ceremony. If the stage show was at 8:15 PM, Engarde couldn't be both committing the murder and at the show. But the testimony says he had to go to the show right after the crime, so maybe the timing is tight. However, without exact times for the show, it's hard to say.

Wait, another angle: The Guitar Case (Evidence 7) has water on the lid, and the crime photo mentions a smashed vase with water on the carpet. The guitar case was empty, but only has Corrida's fingerprints. If the murder involved the guitar case, maybe the water suggests it was used to transport something, but the knife was the weapon. However, the contradiction here isn't clear.

Alternatively, looking at the Wine Glass (Evidence 8) with Adrian Andrews' fingerprints. If she was present, that could implicate her. But how does that contradict Oldbag's testimony? Oldbag is testifying that Engarde did it, but Andrews' fingerprints being there might suggest her involvement. But the testimony is about Engarde wearing the costume, not necessarily excluding others.

Wait, the key contradiction could be the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) set to record during the murder. If Engarde was supposed to be at the stage show, then the camera would have recorded him not being in the room. But unless we have the footage, we can't confirm. However, the Video Tape (Evidence 29) from De Killer's hideout might be the footage. Since De Killer tried to recover it, maybe it shows the real killer. If the real killer is De Killer (as he leaves a Shelly card, Evidence 13), then Oldbag's testimony that Engarde did it is contradicted by the video showing De Killer. But the Video Tape's contents are unknown, so maybe that's not the way to go.

Alternatively, the Knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints, but the autopsy says the cause of death was strangulation, not the stabbing. So the stabbing was after death, meaning the real cause was strangulation. So the killer strangled Corrida first, then stabbed him. If the testimony claims that Engarde stabbed him (which he did, as per the knife), but the actual murder was done via strangulation, which might have been someone else. But the contradiction here is that the testimony focuses on the stabbing as the murder act, but the autopsy shows the murder was via strangulation. However, the testimony says "stabbing poor Juan", which is technically true (he was stabbed), but not the cause of death. So maybe that's not a direct contradiction.

Wait, looking at the Figurine (Evidence 25) with Celeste's Suicide Note inside (Evidence 27). The note tells of Engarde's misdeeds. This might implicate Engarde in Celeste's suicide, which relates to Adrian Andrews' attempted suicide (Evidence 13). But how does this contradict the testimony?

Alternatively, the Magazine Clipping (Evidence 11) about Juan Corrida's secret relationship with A.A. (Adrian Andrews). This could imply a motive for Adrian, but again, not directly contradicting Oldbag's testimony.

Wait, let's focus on the testimonies again. Testimony 2 says "it would have been convenient for him to wear his costume during the murder". Testimony 4 says he must have worn the costume when stabbing. The Jammin' Ninja's Button (Evidence 16) found in Engarde's costume suggests that Engarde's costume (Nickel Samurai) had a button from the Jammin' Ninja (Corrida's costume). This could mean that Engarde was in contact with Corrida, but if the button was ripped off during a struggle, it would place Engarde at the scene. However, the Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows the victim in a samurai outfit. If the victim was dressed as the Jammin' Ninja, and the murderer was in the Nickel Samurai costume, then the button could have been torn during the altercation. But this supports Oldbag's testimony rather than contradicting it.

Hmm. Let's consider the possibility that the testimony is contradicted by evidence related to the time of the murder. Testimony 3 says Engarde had to go to the stage show right after the crime. If the stage show was at a time that conflicts with the time of death, then Engarde couldn't have been at both places. But without exact times for the stage show, it's hard to say. However, the Press Conference Ticket (Evidence 3) mentions the post-ceremony stage show. If the stage show was scheduled for 8 PM, and the murder was at 8:15 PM, then Engarde couldn't be in two places at once. But the ticket doesn't specify the time. The Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was set from 8 PM for 1 hour, covering the murder at 8:15 PM. If Engarde was at the stage show at 8 PM, he couldn't be in the victim's room. But if the stage show was after 8:15 PM, he could have committed the murder and then gone to the show. The testimony says "right after the crime", which suggests that the stage show was immediately following the murder. So the timeline would be: murder at 8:15 PM, then stage show. If the Spy Camera's footage shows someone in the Nickel Samurai costume in the room at 8:15 PM, then Engarde would have to be there, but if the stage show started at, say, 8:30 PM, he could make it. However, the contradiction would arise if the Spy Camera footage shows that the person in the costume left the room after 8:15 PM, but the stage show started at 8:15 PM, making it impossible. But without knowing the exact times, this is speculative.

Alternatively, the Security Lady (Oldbag) in her testimonies is claiming that Engarde did it because he was in the costume, but maybe the real killer was someone else in the costume. For example, Shelly de Killer (Character 13), the assassin, who might have worn the costume to frame Engarde. The Bellboy's Uniform (Evidence 30) from De Killer's hideout is missing a button, which could be the Jammin' Ninja's Button (Evidence 16), but that's a stretch. Alternatively, the Transmitter (Evidence 22) used with the Spy Camera could have been used by Engarde to monitor the room, implying he set it up, but that doesn't contradict the testimony.

Wait, the key contradiction might be between Testimony 3 and the Spy Camera. Testimony 3 says Engarde had to go to the stage show right after the crime, implying he left the crime scene to attend. But if the Spy Camera was recording the room during the murder (8:15 PM), and the stage show was at the same time, Engarde couldn't be in two places. But if the Spy Camera's footage shows the murderer in the room at 8:15 PM, and Engarde was supposed to be at the stage show at that time, then there's a contradiction. Therefore, the evidence would be the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) which was recording during the time of the murder, and the testimony is Testimony 3, which claims he had to go to the stage show right after the crime. If the stage show was at the same time as the murder, then the Spy Camera would have footage showing Engarde in the room, contradicting his alibi. But since the Press Conference Ticket (Evidence 3) says the stage show is after the post-ceremony, maybe the ceremony was before 8 PM, and the stage show after. But without exact times, it's tricky.

Alternatively, looking at the Pistol (Evidence 28) and De Killer's involvement. Since De Killer leaves a card (Evidence 13), and the murder was actually committed by him, then Oldbag's testimony about Engarde is wrong. But the knife has Engarde's fingerprints, which could mean he was involved. However, the real cause of death was strangulation, which could be De Killer's work, and the stabbing with Engarde's knife was staged. This would mean Oldbag's testimony about Engarde stabbing him is contradicted by the autopsy report showing strangulation as the cause. But the testimony says "stabbing poor Juan", not necessarily that the stabbing was the cause of death. So maybe that's not a direct contradiction.

Wait, the Autopsy Report (Evidence 14) says cause of death is strangulation, then stabbed. So the actual murder was strangulation, which the testimony doesn't mention. The testimony focuses on the stabbing. So if the testimony claims that the stabbing was the murder, but the autopsy shows it was strangulation, then that's a contradiction. However, the testimony says "stabbing poor Juan", which is true (he was stabbed), but the cause of death was different. But legally, the murder method is important. If the testimony implies that the stabbing caused death, but it didn't, then the testimony is incorrect. Therefore, the Autopsy Report (Evidence 14) contradicts Testimony 4, which claims Engarde stabbed him to death. But the answer requires the evidence and testimony numbers. Evidence 14 is the Autopsy Report, Testimony 4. But let me check the testimony again.

Testimony 4: "So he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan." The autopsy report states that the cause of death was strangulation, not the stabbing. So the stabbing occurred after death. Therefore, the testimony's assertion that the stabbing was part of the murder (which would be the cause of death) is contradicted by the autopsy report showing that the victim was already dead when stabbed. Therefore, the stabbing was post-mortem, so the testimony's implication that the stabbing was the murder is incorrect. Thus, Evidence 14 (Autopsy Report) contradicts Testimony 4.

But I need to check the exact wording. Testimony 4 says "stabbing poor Juan" which is true, but the autopsy shows the stabbing wasn't the cause of death. So the contradiction is that the testimony suggests the stabbing killed him, but the evidence shows he was already dead from strangulation. Therefore, the testimony is factually incorrect regarding the cause of death.

So the pair would be Evidence 14 (Autopsy Report) and Testimony 4. But let me check the numbers:

Evidence 14: Juan's Autopsy Report (cause: strangled, then stabbed)
Testimony 4: Oldbag's claim that Engarde stabbed him during the murder.

Thus, the evidence shows the stabbing wasn't the cause of death, contradicting the testimony's implication that the stabbing was the murder act.

Alternatively, the testimony doesn't explicitly state that the stabbing was the cause, but the overall context implies that. So this is a valid contradiction.

{"evidence": 14, "testimony": 4}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence contradicts which testimony. The user wants me to find a pair where the evidence and a testimony don't align. Let's start by looking through the testimonies and cross-referencing with the evidence.

First, Testimony 3 by Adrian Andrews says she saw the exact same scene as in the crime photo (Evidence 9). The crime photo description mentions an open guitar case on the floor next to the victim, along with a smashed vase that stained the carpet with water. 

But in Testimony 5, Andrews states that she knocked over the flower vase, causing it to fall onto the guitar case. However, the crime photo shows the guitar case is already open and has water on top of the lid. If Andrews knocked over the vase after finding the body, the water from the vase would have spilled onto the guitar case. But the evidence (Guitar Case, Evidence 7) says there's water only on top of the lid. That suggests the case was closed when the vase broke because if the case was open, water would be inside, not just on the lid. But in the crime photo, the case is open. So there's a contradiction here. If the vase was knocked over by Andrews after the case was already open, then the water should be inside the case, but the evidence says the water is only on top of the lid. Therefore, Testimony 5 contradicts Evidence 7 and the crime photo (Evidence 9). But wait, the testimony is about Andrews knocking the vase over, which caused water to spill onto the guitar case. The problem is that the guitar case in the crime scene is open, so the water from the vase should have gotten inside the case, not just on the lid. But the Guitar Case (Evidence 7) states that there's water only on the lid. That inconsistency suggests that Andrews's testimony about knocking over the vase (Testimony 5) doesn't align with the physical evidence of the guitar case's condition. Therefore, Evidence 7 (Guitar Case) contradicts Testimony 5 (Andrews saying she knocked over the vase onto the case), because if the case was open, the water should be inside, not just on top. Alternatively, maybe the vase was knocked over before the case was opened? But the crime scene shows the case is already open. Hmm. The key contradiction is between Testimony 5 and Evidence 7 (and perhaps Evidence 9). So the correct pair would be Evidence 7 (Guitar Case) and Testimony 5 (Andrews' testimony about knocking over the vase). Let me check again. Andrews says she knocked over the vase, which fell onto the guitar case. The Guitar Case evidence says there's water only on top of the lid. But if the vase was spilled onto the case when it was open (as per the crime photo), then the water would have gone into the case. But the case is empty and only has water on the lid. So the presence of water only on the lid suggests the case was closed when the vase spilled. Therefore, if Andrews knocked the vase over after the case was open, the water should have entered the case. Therefore, her testimony contradicts the evidence. So the pair is Evidence 7 and Testimony 5. But wait, the user asked for one pair. The JSON should be {"evidence":7, "testimony":5}.

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 5}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this. So, the user is asking which evidence and testimony contradict each other. They want just one pair in JSON format. Let me start by going through the testimonies and the evidences to find inconsistencies.

Looking at the testimonies, all four are from Adrian Andrews (Character 8). Let's read them carefully.

Testimony 0: She says she doesn't remember clearly because she was dazed.
Testimony 1: She supposes she opened the guitar case after knocking over the vase.
Testimony 2: She says it's not a big deal because the case was empty.
Testimony 3: She doesn't know why she opened the case.

Now, the evidences. Let's check the ones related to the guitar case and the vase. Evidence 7 is the Guitar Case. It mentions that it was found next to the victim, empty, with water only on the lid. Also, the Crime Photo (Evidence 9) describes the scene with the guitar case on the floor and the remains of a smashed vase that stained the carpet with water.

Wait, the guitar case has water only on the lid. The vase was smashed, so water was on the carpet. If Adrian knocked over the vase, the water would have spilled on the carpet, and maybe on the guitar case. But the guitar case's lid has water on top. If she opened the case after knocking over the vase, then opening the case would have allowed water to get inside, right? But the case is empty and only has water on top of the lid. Hmm. Let me think.

If the vase was smashed and spilled water on the carpet near the case, then when she opened the case, maybe some water got on the lid. But the case itself is empty. But according to her testimony, she opened the case after knocking over the vase. But the presence of water only on the lid might conflict with that sequence. Wait, the guitar case's description says there's water on top of the lid. If she opened the case after the vase was broken, maybe the water from the vase's spill would have gotten onto the case. But if the case was already open when the vase was knocked over, the water would have gotten inside. But the case is empty, so perhaps the lid was closed when the vase was broken, leaving water on top. Then she opened it, but the water on the lid would have been from before she opened it. Wait, maybe the contradiction is that if she opened the case after the vase was broken, the inside of the case would have water. But the evidence says the case is empty with water only on top of the lid, not inside. So if she opened the case after the vase was broken, the water would have gotten inside when she opened it. But the case is empty and has water only on the lid. Therefore, the case must have been closed when the vase broke, so the water was on the lid. But if she opened it after, then opening it would have allowed water to get in. But since there's no water inside, maybe she opened it before the vase was broken. Wait, but the testimony says she knocked the vase over first, then opened the case. If that's the case, then when she knocked the vase over, water would spill, then she opened the case, which was on the floor next to the spilled water. So when she opened the case, the water could have gotten into the case. But the evidence says the case is empty with water only on the lid. That suggests that the case was closed when the water spilled, so the water is on the lid. Therefore, if she opened the case after the vase was broken, the water would have gotten inside, but the case is empty. Therefore, her testimony that she opened the case after knocking over the vase contradicts the evidence showing water only on the lid, implying the case was closed when the water spilled. So the contradiction is between Testimony 1 (she opened the case after knocking over the vase) and Evidence 7 (water only on the lid, case empty). If she opened the case after the vase was broken, water should have gotten inside, but the case is empty with no water inside. Therefore, the testimony and evidence conflict. So the pair would be Evidence 7 and Testimony 1. Wait, but looking at the JSON format, they need the numbers. Evidence 7 is the Guitar Case (Evidence 7). Testimony 1 is the second testimony. So the answer would be {"evidence": 7, "testimony": 1}.

Alternatively, maybe the testimony that she opened the case and it was empty (Testimony 2) contradicts something. But Testimony 2 says the case was empty, which matches Evidence 7. The problem is the water. Let me check Evidence 7 again. It says "there is some water, but only on top of the lid." So the water is on the lid's exterior, not inside. If the vase was knocked over (spilling water on the carpet), and then she opened the case, then when she opened it, the case would have been on the floor where the water was. Opening it would let water inside. But Evidence 7 says the case is empty with water only on the lid. So that suggests the case was closed when the water was spilled. Therefore, if she opened the case after the vase was broken, the case would have been opened, allowing water inside, but the evidence shows no water inside. Therefore, her Testimony 1 (opened the case after knocking over the vase) contradicts Evidence 7 (water only on the lid, case empty). Therefore, the pair is Evidence 7 and Testimony 1.

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 1}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the task is to find which evidence contradicts one of the testimonies given. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies, and I need to find a pair where the evidence doesn't align with the testimony.

First, let me look at the testimonies. Adrian Andrews has several testimonies (0 to 6). She claims that Matt Engarde is the murderer. Specifically, in Testimony 4, she mentions that the button (Evidence 16) and the knife (Evidence 15) confirm Matt's guilt. Then in Testimony 5, she says the button was torn off during a fight between Juan and Matt.

Now, looking at Evidence 16: Jammin' Ninja's Button. It's covered in Corrida's blood and found in Engarde's hakama. The knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints. But wait, the autopsy report (Evidence 14) says the cause of death was strangulation with a scarf first, then stabbed. So the actual murder method was strangulation, and the knife was used post-mortem. But the knife with Engarde's fingerprints would suggest he stabbed the victim, but the autopsy shows the stabbing wasn't the cause of death. So if Matt's motive was to kill Juan, why stab him after he's already dead? That seems odd. However, the contradiction might be elsewhere.

Another angle: Testimony 3 says Matt didn't have an alibi during the murder time. But if we look at the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) set to record from 8 PM for 1 hour (time of death is 8:15 PM). The camera was in the victim's room. The Video Tape (Evidence 29) from De Killer's hideout might show something. Also, the Stuffed Bear (Evidence 23) with the spy camera, which Engarde bought (Evidence 24). If the spy camera was recording, maybe it captured the murder. But the Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows the victim in a samurai outfit with a knife in the chest. However, if the spy camera was running, maybe the footage would show who was there. But how does that relate to the testimony?

Wait, the testimony in question is Testimony 3: Matt didn't have an alibi. If the spy camera was recording the room during the murder, maybe the footage would show that Matt wasn't there, contradicting the testimony. Alternatively, if the camera was in the victim's room, maybe Matt wasn't present, thus providing an alibi. But the problem is that the testimony claims he had no alibi, but evidence might show otherwise. Hmm.

Wait, the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was set to record from 8 PM for 1 hour, which includes the time of death at 8:15 PM. The Video Tape (29) from De Killer's hideout might have the footage. If the camera was in the room, perhaps it shows that Matt wasn't present, contradicting the idea that he was there. Alternatively, maybe the footage shows someone else, like Shelly de Killer. But if the camera was in the room, and the murder happened there, the footage could show the actual killer, which might not be Matt. But the testimony says Matt didn't have an alibi. If the camera footage shows that Matt wasn't present, then he does have an alibi, contradicting Testimony 3. However, the evidence about the camera is 21, and the Video Tape is 29. But the user is supposed to choose from the provided evidences.

Alternatively, looking at the autopsy report (14) which states the cause of death was strangulation, not the stabbing. The knife with Engarde's fingerprints (15) is found, but if the victim was already dead when stabbed, then the knife isn't the murder weapon. So Testimony 4 and 5, which link the button and knife to Matt, may be contradicted because the actual cause of death was strangulation. But how does that tie in? The testimony says the evidence (button and knife) confirm Matt's guilt, but the real cause was strangulation. Therefore, the knife isn't the murder weapon, so the evidence (knife with fingerprints) doesn't prove Matt's guilt. That could contradict Testimony 4, which claims the evidence confirms Matt's guilt. But the question is which specific evidence contradicts which testimony.

Another possible contradiction: Testimony 5 says the button was torn off during a fight between Matt and Juan. However, the button (Evidence 16) is from the Jammin' Ninja's costume (Juan's character). If it was found in Matt's hakama (part of the Nickel Samurai costume), perhaps the fight happened. But the autopsy says death was by strangulation. Maybe the fight didn't happen because the button could have been planted. Alternatively, if the button was found in Matt's clothing, but the strangulation suggests a different method, maybe the button is unrelated.

Wait, the Jammin' Ninja's Button (16) is covered in Corrida's blood, found in Engarde's hakama. If the button was torn off during a fight, but the victim was strangled first, then the fight might have happened after death, which is impossible. So the button being torn during a fight contradicts the cause of death being strangulation. Because if Juan was already dead (strangled), he couldn't have been in a fight that tore the button. Therefore, Testimony 5 (button torn during fight) is contradicted by the autopsy report (Evidence 14) which states the cause was strangulation. So the actual murder method would mean that the fight and button tearing couldn't have happened when Juan was alive. Therefore, Evidence 14 contradicts Testimony 5.

Alternatively, maybe the button was planted. But according to the testimony, the button was torn off during the fight, which would have happened before death. But if the victim was strangled first, then the stabbing and the button tearing would have occurred post-mortem, which is possible. Wait, the autopsy says time of death is 8:15 PM, cause: strangled, then stabbed. So Juan was strangled to death at 8:15, then stabbed. If the fight happened before 8:15, then the button could have been torn then. But the stabbing was after death. So maybe the fight happened before the murder. However, the button being in Matt's hakama would link him to the fight. But the testimony says the button was torn during the fight between Matt and Juan, implying that the fight was part of the murder. But if the murder was via strangulation, maybe the fight didn't happen. Alternatively, the fight could have been during the strangulation. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, looking at the Spy Camera (21) which was recording the room during the murder. The camera was in the stuffed bear (23), which Engarde bought (24). If the camera was recording, then the footage would show who was in the room. If the footage shows someone else (like Shelly de Killer), then Matt wasn't present, contradicting Testimony 3 (no alibi). But if the camera was in the room, then Matt's presence or absence would be recorded. If the camera footage proves Matt wasn't there, then he has an alibi, contradicting Testimony 3. But the Spy Camera is evidence 21, and the testimony is 3. So this could be the pair.

Wait, the testimony in Testimony 3 is "And he didn't have an alibi for what he was doing at the time of the murder." If the Spy Camera (21) was recording the room, and the Video Tape (29) shows that Matt wasn't present (because the real killer was someone else, like Shelly), then Matt's alibi could be established, contradicting the testimony. However, the Video Tape (29) is from De Killer's hideout, and its contents are unknown. The user might not have that info, but the Spy Camera (21) itself is evidence that could potentially provide an alibi. But the problem is that the testimony claims Matt has no alibi, but the existence of the spy camera could provide one if the footage shows he wasn't there. Therefore, Evidence 21 (Spy Camera) contradicts Testimony 3 (no alibi) because the camera could have recorded Matt's absence, giving him an alibi.

Alternatively, the Security Lady (Character 3) or other testimonies. Let me check the testimonies again.

Testimony 3: Matt didn't have an alibi. But if the Spy Camera (21) was recording the victim's room from 8 PM, and Matt was supposed to be in his room (north of the path per the Hotel Guidemap, Evidence 6), but the camera in the victim's room would show if he was there. If the camera didn't capture Matt, then he has an alibi (being elsewhere), contradicting Testimony 3. So Evidence 21 (Spy Camera) contradicts Testimony 3 (no alibi). That seems plausible.

Another possibility: The Pistol (28) used by De Killer to shoot Franziska, but I'm not sure how that ties in. The Whip (31) is Franziska's, but not relevant here.

Wait, the button (16) is found in Matt's hakama. Testimony 5 says it was torn during a fight. But if the fight happened, the button would have blood on it. The autopsy says death was by strangulation, then stabbing. So the blood could be from the stabbing. But if the button was torn during a struggle before the strangulation, that's possible. I'm not sure if that's a contradiction.

Alternatively, the Magazine Clipping (11) says Juan was having a rendezvous with A.A. (Adrian Andrews). The Suicide Report (12) and Attempted Suicide (13) might suggest a motive for Adrian. But how does that tie into the testimonies?

Alternatively, the Wine Glass (8) has Andrews' fingerprints. Found next to the victim. If she was there, maybe she's involved. But her testimony is accusing Matt.

Wait, the knife (15) has Engarde's fingerprints, but the autopsy says the cause was strangulation. So the knife was used post-mortem. So the presence of the knife with his fingerprints doesn't prove he committed the murder, only that he stabbed the corpse. Thus, Testimony 4 says the evidence (knife and button) confirm Matt's guilt. But the knife isn't the murder weapon. Therefore, Evidence 14 (autopsy) contradicts Testimony 4. Because the autopsy shows the murder was by strangulation, so the knife with Engarde's prints doesn't confirm he's the murderer, only that he tampered with the body. So Testimony 4 is contradicted by Evidence 14.

So the pair would be Evidence 14 (autopsy) and Testimony 4. Because Testimony 4 says the evidence (knife and button) confirm Matt's guilt, but the autopsy shows the actual cause of death was strangulation, meaning the knife wasn't the murder weapon. Therefore, the knife's presence with Matt's prints doesn't confirm he committed the murder, only that he was involved post-mortem. Therefore, the testimony's claim is contradicted by the autopsy report.

So the answer would be {"evidence": 14, "testimony": 4}.

{"evidence": 14, "testimony": 4}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to find which evidence contradicts one of the testimonies provided by Adrian Andrews. The user wants only one pair, so I have to look through each testimony and check against the evidences to spot inconsistencies.

First, let's list out all of Adrian Andrews' testimonies (Testimony 0 to 5). The key is to cross-reference each statement with the evidence provided. 

Starting with Testimony 0: Andrews says she didn't pour the juice for herself. Looking at Evidence 8, the wine glass has her fingerprints. If she didn't pour it for herself, why are her fingerprints there? Maybe she poured it for someone else, like the victim. But then, the autopsy report (Evidence 14) says the cause of death was strangulation and a stab wound. The glass was found next to the victim filled with tomato juice. Since the victim was already dead, pouring juice for him wouldn't make sense. But Andrews claims she thought he had fainted, so she poured juice (Testimony 4). That seems to align, but maybe there's a contradiction in the fingerprints.

Wait, Evidence 8 states the wine glass has Andrews' fingerprints. If she poured it for the victim, that would make sense. But Testimony 0 says she didn't pour it for herself. Maybe the contradiction is that the glass has her fingerprints, implying she handled it, but her testimony is about not pouring it for herself. However, that might not be a direct contradiction. Let's keep that in mind but check other testimonies.

Testimony 4: She thought he had fainted, so she poured him juice. But the autopsy report states the time of death was 8:15 PM. If she arrived after that, the victim was already dead. If the juice was poured after death, why is there a full glass with her fingerprints? Maybe the contradiction is that she claims to have poured juice for him after he was already dead. But how does that tie into the evidence?

Looking at Evidence 9 (Crime Photo), there's a glass of juice behind the victim on the dresser and a full bottle on the desk. The photo also shows the guitar case and a smashed vase. Testimony 5 says she knocked over the vase when she realized he was dead. The glass with her fingerprints (Evidence 8) is next to the victim, so maybe she poured it after arriving. But if the victim was dead at 8:15, and she poured the juice after that, her fingerprints on the glass would make sense. But is there a contradiction here?

Wait, Testimony 5 says she knocked over the vase when she realized he was dead. The crime photo (Evidence 9) shows the smashed vase. The guitar case (Evidence 7) has water only on top of the lid, which might be from the vase. But according to the testimony, she knocked the vase over after realizing he was dead, which would have been after 8:15. However, the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was set to record from 8 PM for an hour. If the camera was running, perhaps it captured something conflicting with her testimony. But how?

Alternatively, let's look at Testimony 5 where she says when she realized he was dead, she knocked over the vase. However, the Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows the smashed vase's remains next to the guitar case, which has water only on the lid. If the vase was smashed, the water would have spilled onto the carpet. But the guitar case's lid has water only on top. Maybe if the vase was knocked over after the murder, the water would have soaked into the carpet, but the guitar case's water is only on top. But this might not be a direct contradiction.

Another angle: Testimony 4 says she poured juice for him thinking he fainted. But the glass (Evidence 8) has tomato juice, and the bottle on the desk is full. If she poured from the bottle into the glass, the bottle should have less juice, but the photo shows a full bottle. That's a contradiction. Because if she poured from the bottle, it wouldn't be full anymore. So the presence of a full bottle (as per Evidence 9) contradicts her testimony that she poured juice for him. Therefore, Evidence 9 (Crime Photo) showing a full bottle contradicts Testimony 4 where she claims to have poured juice from it. But the problem is that the user provided Evidence 8 as the wine glass filled with tomato juice, which is the one with her fingerprints. But in the Crime Photo (Evidence 9), there's a full bottle on the desk. If the bottle is still full, then she couldn't have poured the juice from it. Therefore, her testimony about pouring juice would be impossible if the bottle was still full. So Evidence 9 (Crime Photo) contradicts Testimony 4 (pouring juice) because the bottle is full, meaning she couldn't have poured from it.

But let me check the details again. Evidence 8: Wine Glass filled with tomato juice. Found next to the victim. No sign it's been drank. Bears Andrews' fingerprints. Evidence 9: Crime Photo shows the glass of juice on the dresser and a full bottle on the desk. So if Andrews poured the juice from the bottle into the glass, the bottle should be partially empty. But the photo shows the bottle is full. Therefore, this is a contradiction. Andrews says she poured juice (Testimony 4), but the bottle is still full. Therefore, Evidence 9 (Crime Photo) contradicts Testimony 4. But in the list of evidences, Evidence 9 is the crime photo, which includes the full bottle. So the evidence (9) shows the bottle is full, but the testimony (4) says she poured from it. That's a contradiction.

Alternatively, maybe another angle. Testimony 5 says she knocked over the vase when she realized he was dead. The crime photo (Evidence 9) shows the smashed vase's remains next to the guitar case. The guitar case (Evidence 7) has water only on the lid. If the vase was smashed when she knocked it over, the water would have spilled onto the carpet. The crime photo's caption mentions the carpet is stained with water from the vase. However, the guitar case's lid has water on top. If the vase was smashed after the murder, the water would have soaked the carpet, but the guitar case's lid might have water from the vase's spill. However, the guitar case's description says "some water, but only on top of the lid." If the vase was smashed, the water would have splashed around, possibly getting the guitar case wet. But the fact that only the lid's top has water could imply that the water came from a different source, maybe before the vase was smashed. But this might not be a direct contradiction.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 5: "When I realized that he was dead... That's when I knocked the flower vase over." The crime photo shows the smashed vase. However, the Spy Camera (Evidence 21) was recording from 8 PM for an hour. If the murder occurred at 8:15 PM, and the camera was in the room, maybe the footage would show Andrews entering and knocking over the vase. But the video tape (Evidence 29) is retrieved from De Killer's hideout, but its contents are unknown. However, maybe the video shows something else. But without knowing the video's content, this might not be helpful.

Another angle: The Magazine Clipping (Evidence 11) talks about Corrida's affair with A.A. (Adrian Andrews). The Suicide Report (Evidence 12) mentions Celeste Inpax's suicide, found by Corrida. The Attempted Suicide Report (Evidence 13) says Adrian attempted suicide due to Celeste's death. Celeste's Suicide Note (Evidence 27) found in the Figurine (Evidence 25) tells of Engarde's misdeeds. So Adrian might have a motive. But how does this tie into her testimony?

Wait, the Knife (Evidence 15) has Engarde's fingerprints. But the autopsy says cause of death was strangulation with a scarf first. The button from the Jammin' Ninja's costume (Evidence 16) found in Engarde's hakama. But if Adrian is the killer, perhaps she used the scarf. But this might not directly relate to her testimony.

Looking back at the testimonies: Testimony 0 says she didn't pour the juice for herself. The glass (Evidence 8) has her fingerprints, so she must have handled it. But if she poured it for the victim, that's okay. However, the victim was already dead. So if she poured it after he was dead, maybe she's lying about the reason. But the main contradiction is the full bottle. If she poured from the full bottle, it wouldn't be full anymore. Therefore, Evidence 9 (Crime Photo showing full bottle) contradicts Testimony 4 (pouring juice from it).

Thus, the correct pair would be evidence 9 (Crime Photo) and testimony 4.

{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 4}

Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the problem is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants one pair, so I need to look through all the testimonies and see which one is contradicted by one of the evidences.

First, let's list out the testimonies given by Alita. There are six of them, from Testimony 0 to Testimony 5. Let's go through each one and see if any of the evidence directly contradicts her statements.

Testimony 0: "I did go to the clinic that day. My first time in half a year, since I quit in January." So she's saying she hadn't been to the clinic for six months, but went on the day in question. But looking at the evidences, Evidence 18 is Wocky's Chart found in the clinic safe, signed by nurse Alita Tiala. If she quit in January, how come her signature is on a chart from June? That would mean she was still working there or had access after she quit, which contradicts her statement that she hadn't been there for six months. That's a possible contradiction between Testimony 0 and Evidence 18.

Testimony 4: "Why would I go to the clinic now for a half-year-old chart?" She's implying she didn't go to get the chart. But Evidence 18 shows the chart was signed by her, so if the chart is from June (current month?), then she must have been there to sign it. Wait, the autopsy report says time of death is June 14. So the check-up report (Evidence 13) is from June. The chart in Evidence 18 is found in the clinic safe and signed by Alita. If she quit in January, how did she sign a chart from June? That would mean she was still working there, contradicting her statement that she quit and hadn't been there for six months. So Testimony 0 is contradicted by Evidence 18. Alternatively, Testimony 4 is about going for a half-year-old chart. Maybe the chart is recent, not half a year old. Wait, but the chart is found in the safe, and if she signed it, then she was there after quitting. So Testimony 0's claim of not going to the clinic for half a year (since January) would be contradicted by Evidence 18, which has her signature on a chart from June, which is current. So that's a contradiction. 

Another possible point: Testimony 6 (if that exists?), wait, the user listed Testimony 0 to Testimony 5 under Alita's testimonies. Wait, no, looking back, the Testimony list given is Testimony 0 to Testimony 6, all by Alita. Wait, the user's list shows Testimonies 0 to 6, but each labeled as Person: Alita. So seven testimonies? Wait, no, the user lists Testimonies 0 to 6, but each under Alita. Let me check again:

Testimonies:

Testimony 0: Alita - went to clinic that day, first time in half a year since quitting in Jan.

Testimony 1: Alita - went to warn him (Wocky had pistol).

Testimony 2: Alita - Dr. was timid, couldn't admit mistake.

Testimony 3: Alita - Why else go? Not hiding secrets.

Testimony 4: Alita - Why go now for half-year-old chart?

Testimony 5: Alita - Wanted to warn as old friend.

Testimony 6: Alita - Nothing happened, warned and left.

So the key contradiction is between Testimony 0 and Evidence 18. Because she says she hadn't been to the clinic in half a year (since January), but the chart (Evidence 18) is signed by her and found in the clinic's safe. If the chart is from June (current time), then she must have been there recently to sign it, contradicting her claim of not going there for six months. Therefore, Evidence 18 (Wocky's Chart signed by her) contradicts Testimony 0 where she says she hasn't been there since January.

Another possibility is Evidence 16: Alita's Sandals found in the clinic foyer with a big toe print. If she was there, her sandals being there would show she was at the clinic, but she claims she only went once (the day of the incident). But maybe that's not a direct contradiction. Wait, but she says in Testimony 0 that she went that day (the day of the crime) for the first time in half a year. So if her sandals are found there, that's expected. So maybe that's not the contradiction.

Alternatively, Testimony 4: She asks why she would go for a half-year-old chart. If the chart is from June (current), then it's not half a year old. But the chart might be older. Wait, Evidence 18 is Wocky's Chart found in the safe, signed by Alita. If Wocky's check-up report (Evidence 13) is from June, and the chart (Evidence 18) is also from June, then the chart is recent, not half a year old. So when she says in Testimony 4, "Why would I go to the clinic now for a half-year-old chart?" she's implying that the chart is old, but the actual chart is recent, which would mean she had to go to the clinic recently (contradicting Testimony 0). Wait, but Testimony 4 is her questioning why she would go now for a chart that's half a year old. If the chart is actually recent (signed by her in June), then she's lying about the chart's age. But how does that connect to the evidence? If the chart is in the clinic safe, and she signed it, then she must have been there to sign it. So if she signed it in June, that's after she quit in January, which would mean she was back at the clinic, contradicting her Testimony 0. So Evidence 18 (her signature on a June chart) contradicts Testimony 0 (she hadn't been there since January). 

Therefore, the correct pair is Evidence 18 and Testimony 0. But wait, looking at the evidence numbers, Evidence 18 is "Wocky's Chart: Found in the Meraktis Clinic safe. Signed by nurse Alita Tiala." So that's her signature on a recent chart. Therefore, she was at the clinic after she quit, contradicting her statement in Testimony 0. So the contradiction is Evidence 18 and Testimony 0.

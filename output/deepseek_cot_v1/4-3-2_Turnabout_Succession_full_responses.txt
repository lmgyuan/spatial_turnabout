Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. So, I need to look through the testimonies and see if any of them are contradicted by the evidence provided.

First, let's go through the testimonies. The person giving all these testimonies is Brushel (Testimony 0 to 7). Let's check each one.

Testimony 0: Brushel says he visited the studio around 9:00 PM for an interview. The evidence includes Misham's Autopsy Report (Evidence 13) which states the time of death as 9:00-9:30 PM. If Brushel was there at 9:00, maybe that's when the poisoning happened?

Testimony 2: He mentions that the daughter (Vera?) brought coffee right after they started. The Coffee Mug (Evidence 7) has poison on the rim. Also, Testimony 6 says Drew Misham had one sip and then collapsed. The autopsy report says death by poison, which matches. But Brushel says he also drank the coffee and is fine (Testimony 5). But the Coffee Mug has poison on the rim. If Vera brought the coffee, maybe only one cup was poisoned? Or maybe Brushel's cup wasn't. Not sure if that's a contradiction yet.

Testimony 7: Brushel states no one else entered the room besides Vera the whole time. But looking at the evidence, maybe there's something about how the poison was administered. The Hidden Painting (Evidence 8) or the Tiny Frame (Evidence 11) with poison traces. Wait, the Tiny Frame has atroquinine, which is the same poison as in the Coffee Mug. The frame is small, maybe part of the studio. If the poison was on the frame, maybe someone else handled it. But Testimony 7 says only Vera entered, but maybe the frame was touched earlier by someone else. Alternatively, the Letter from Misham (Evidence 31) has poison on the stamp. If the letter was sent, maybe the poison came from that. But Brushel's testimony about no one else entering the room might conflict if the poison was applied earlier by someone else, but during the time Brushel was there, only Vera came in. Hmm.

Wait, the Autopsy Report (Evidence13) says time of death 9:00-9:30 PM. Brushel was there at 9:00 PM. If he was there during the time of death, but the poisoning was via coffee served then, and the poison is slow-acting. Wait, no, the Coffee Mug's poison is atroquinine, which is slow-acting? Or is it fast? Wait, the Coffee Mug (Evidence7) says "slow-acting deadly poison atroquinine". So if Drew drank the coffee at 9 PM when Brushel arrived, the poison would take time. But the autopsy says time of death is 9:00-9:30 PM, which is immediate. That seems contradictory. Because if the poison is slow-acting, death should occur later than the time of ingestion. But the time of death is the same as when he drank it. So that's a contradiction between Evidence7 (slow-acting poison) and Testimony6 (he had one sip and next moment collapsed). Because slow-acting wouldn't kill him instantly. Therefore, Brushel's Testimony6 says he collapsed immediately after sipping, but the poison is slow-acting. So that's a contradiction between Evidence7 (slow-acting) and Testimony6 (immediate death). 

So the evidence that the poison is slow-acting (Evidence7) contradicts Testimony6 where Brushel says Drew collapsed right after drinking. Therefore, the correct pair is Evidence7 and Testimony6.

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 6}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. Let's start by going through each testimony and checking against the evidence to find contradictions.

First, looking at the testimonies. All of them are from Brushel (Testimony 0 to 4). The key points in his testimonies are:

Testimony 0: Arrived at the studio, Misham was at his desk.
Testimony 1: Misham was writing a letter, sealed the envelope quickly.
Testimony 2: The envelope was yellow and left at the crime scene.
Testimony 3: Didn't think much at the time.
Testimony 4: Now thinks it might have been a suicide note.

Now, the evidences. Let's check which ones relate to letters, envelopes, or the crime scene. 

Evidence 9: Red Envelope found in victim's desk drawer, opened and resealed. Contains two sheets. 

Evidence 31: Letter from Misham posted before dying, poison on stamp. 

Evidence 2: Gramarye Envelope from Mr. Wright, says not to open until the time is right.

Brushel's testimony 2 mentions a yellow envelope left at the crime scene. However, the Red Envelope (Evidence 9) is described as red. That's a contradiction because the testimony says yellow, but the evidence is red. 

But wait, Evidence 31 is a letter from Misham with poison on the stamp. Testimony 1 says Misham was writing a letter and sealed the envelope. If the envelope in the testimony is yellow, but the evidence related to Misham's letter (Evidence 31) might have a different color. However, the description of Evidence 31 doesn't mention the envelope color. 

Evidence 9 is a Red Envelope found in the victim's desk. Brushel's Testimony 2 says the envelope he saw was yellow. If the envelope at the crime scene is red (Evidence 9), but Brushel claims it's yellow, that's a contradiction. Alternatively, maybe the letter Misham was writing is the one in Evidence 31, which was sent out. 

But according to Testimony 2, Brushel says the envelope he saw (the yellow one) was left at the crime scene. If the actual evidence found (like Evidence 9) is red, then that's a discrepancy. So the contradiction would be between Testimony 2 (yellow envelope) and Evidence 9 (red envelope). However, Testimony 2 is about the envelope Misham was writing, which he sealed. Evidence 9 is a red envelope found in the victim's drawer. Wait, but the testimony says "it was left at the crime scene," but the evidence (9) is in the desk. Maybe another evidence?

Alternatively, Evidence 31's letter from Misham was posted just before dying, with poison on the stamp. The testimony says Misham was writing a letter and sealed it. If the envelope in the testimony is yellow, but the one sent (Evidence 31) might be a different color. But the testimony claims the yellow envelope was left at the scene, but the evidence found at the scene (if any) is a different color. However, maybe the envelope Brushel saw (yellow) is different from the red one found. But if the testimony says the yellow envelope was left at the crime scene, but the actual evidence found (Red Envelope, Evidence 9) is red, that's a contradiction. Therefore, Testimony 2 (yellow) vs Evidence 9 (red) would be a contradiction.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 1 and 2: Brushel says Misham was writing a letter and sealed it in a yellow envelope. Then Testimony 2 says that this yellow envelope was left at the crime scene. But the evidence at the crime scene includes Evidence 31 (Letter from Misham) which was sent, so maybe that's not the same. Or Evidence 10 (Letter Box) which is empty. 

Wait, Evidence 10 is the Letter Box, which is empty. So if Brushel saw Misham seal a letter and put it in the mail, but the Letter Box is empty, that could be a contradiction. But Testimony 2 says the envelope was left at the crime scene. So maybe the letter in the crime scene's desk (Evidence 9) is red, but Brushel says it's yellow. So the contradiction is between Testimony 2 (yellow envelope) and Evidence 9 (red envelope).

Alternatively, Evidence 2: Gramarye Envelope from Mr. Wright, which is not opened yet. But that's a different envelope. The testimonies are about the envelope Misham was writing. 

So, the key contradiction is the color of the envelope. Brushel testifies it's yellow, but the envelope found (Evidence 9) is red. Therefore, the evidence 9 contradicts testimony 2. However, in the given options, the user asks to output evidence and testimony numbers. So Evidence 9 is number 9, Testimony 2 is number 2. But let me check the evidence list again.

Wait, Evidence 9 is the Red Envelope found in the victim's desk. The testimony says the envelope Brushel saw (yellow) was left at the crime scene. If the actual envelope found is red, that's a contradiction. Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 9 (Red Envelope) and Testimony 2 (yellow envelope). But Evidence 9 is a red envelope, which contradicts the testimony's yellow. So the answer is {"evidence": 9, "testimony": 2}. 

Wait, but another angle: Brushel's testimony 1 and 2. He says Misham was writing a letter and sealed it in a yellow envelope, which was left at the crime scene. However, the actual envelope found (if any) is different. Let's check other evidences. Evidence 31 is a letter from Misham with poison on the stamp. The description says it was posted just before dying. So maybe that's the letter he was writing. If the envelope sent (Evidence 31) was yellow, but the testimony says it was left at the scene, but Evidence 31 was mailed, not left. Then the envelope left at the scene might be the Red Envelope (Evidence 9). So if Brushel says the yellow envelope was left at the scene, but the actual envelope there is red, that's a contradiction. Therefore, Evidence 9 (Red) contradicts Testimony 2 (yellow). So the answer is evidence 9 and testimony 2. But let me check the testimony again.

Testimony 2: "It was a yellow envelope. ...I heard it was left at the crime scene." So Brushel is saying the envelope he saw (yellow) was left at the scene. But the evidence at the scene (if it's the Red Envelope) would contradict that. But in Evidence 9's description, it's found in the victim's desk drawer. So maybe the actual envelope left at the scene is different. Or perhaps the letter that was sent (Evidence 31) is the one Misham was writing, and Brushel's testimony about the envelope's color contradicts the actual color of the letter sent. But Evidence 31's envelope color isn't mentioned. Only the stamp has poison. So maybe the contradiction isn't there.

Alternatively, maybe Evidence 31 (Letter from Misham) has a stamp with poison, but Brushel's testimony says Misham sealed the envelope (so he would have licked the stamp or envelope). But the poison is on the stamp. But the testimony doesn't mention that. Not sure.

Alternatively, the contradiction could be between Testimony 4 where Brushel thinks Misham was writing a suicide note, but Evidence 13 (Misham's autopsy report) says he died of poisoning, which would be a suicide if he wrote a note. But that's not necessarily a contradiction. Or perhaps the actual evidence shows it was murder. But the evidence for Misham's death is Evidence 7 (Coffee Mug) with poison, which was in his coffee, implying someone else poisoned him. If the coffee was poisoned, then Misham's death is a murder, not suicide, so Brushel's Testimony 4 (suicide note) would be contradicted by the evidence showing murder. But in that case, which evidence contradicts Testimony 4? Evidence 7, which shows the coffee was poisoned by someone else. So then the contradiction would be Evidence 7 and Testimony 4. But the user wants one pair. So Evidence 7 (coffee mug with poison) contradicts Testimony 4 (suicide note), implying it was murder, not suicide. That could be another possibility.

Alternatively, let's think about the timeline. Misham was poisoned, and the poison is atroquinine, which is slow-acting. If the suicide note were written, but the method was poisoning via coffee, which is a slow poison, then perhaps the note would be written before, but the poison could have been administered by someone else. However, if Brushel thinks it's a suicide note, but the evidence shows that the poisoning was via the coffee mug (Evidence 7), which may have been administered by someone else. But how does that directly contradict? Unless the suicide note would suggest Misham intended to kill himself, but the poison was in the coffee, which he drank. If he wrote the note, then maybe he poisoned himself. But the evidence might show that the poison was applied to the coffee mug's rim, which he could have done himself. So that's not necessarily a contradiction. So maybe that's not the contradiction.

Going back to the envelope color. The key contradiction would be Testimony 2 stating the envelope was yellow, but the actual envelope found (Evidence 9) is red. Therefore, {"evidence": 9, "testimony": 2}.

But wait, Evidence 9 is a red envelope found in the victim's desk. Brushel's testimony says the envelope Misham was writing was yellow and left at the crime scene. If the desk is part of the crime scene, and the envelope found there is red, then Brushel's testimony about the color is wrong. Therefore, this is a contradiction. So that's the pair.

{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 2}

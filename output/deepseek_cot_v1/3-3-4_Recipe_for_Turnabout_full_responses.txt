Okay, let's start by understanding the problem. We need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. Our task is to look through these and identify a pair where the evidence directly contradicts a testimony.

First, let's look at the testimonies. The testimonies given here are all from Armstrong (Testimony 0 to 4). Let's read each one carefully.

Testimony 0: Armstrong says there was a mirror in the middle of the restaurant dividing the two halves. Testimony 1: He mentions there's only one seat from which you could have seen an image of the victim. Testimony 2: That seat was at the table next to the victim's where the old man was sitting. Testimony 3: After the incident, he moved the mirror so it wasn't in the way. Testimony 4: He claims he didn't touch anything else.

Now, looking at the evidences, we need to find one that contradicts any of these statements. Let's go through relevant evidences.

Evidence 11 is the Tres Bien Floor Plans, which describe the view from the entrance being obstructed and only seeing the patio. Also, Evidence 12 is the Crime Photo, which shows two tables separated by a folding screen, with an empty table closer to the camera and the victim's table further. The caption mentions the view from the entrance could only see the patio, implying that maybe the mirror wasn't there as Armstrong said.

Wait, Testimony 0 says there was a mirror in the middle. But the floor plans (Evidence 11) mention the view from the entrance is obstructed and could only see the patio. If there was a mirror in the middle dividing the two halves, maybe that would affect the view. But the floor plan doesn't mention a mirror. So maybe the floor plan (Evidence 11) contradicts Testimony 0, which says there was a mirror. But wait, the floor plan's caption says the view was obstructed and could only see the patio. How does that relate to the mirror?

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 3: Armstrong says he moved the mirror after the incident. But the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) was taken from near the kitchen and shows two tables separated by a folding screen. The photo's caption mentions the presence of a folding screen, not a mirror. If Armstrong moved the mirror after the incident, but the crime photo (taken at the time of the incident) doesn't show a mirror, that could be a contradiction. Wait, but Testimony 0 says the mirror was there during the incident, and Testimony 3 says he moved it afterward. If the crime photo (taken during the incident) doesn't show the mirror, then that would contradict Testimony 0. However, the Crime Photo's caption says there are two dining tables separated by a folding screen, not a mirror. So if Armstrong's testimony claims there was a mirror dividing the two halves, but the crime scene photo shows a folding screen instead, that's a contradiction. So Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) contradicts Testimony 0.

Wait, Testimony 0 says there was a mirror (la mirror) dividing the restaurant. But the floor plans (Evidence 11) mention the view from the entrance is obstructed and could only see the patio. Maybe the floor plan shows a folding screen instead of a mirror. Let me check Evidence 11 again: Tres Bien Floor Plans caption says "The view from the entrance is obstructed and could only see the patio." Evidence 12's caption says "Two dining tables are separated by a folding screen." So the actual crime scene photo shows a folding screen, not a mirror. Therefore, Armstrong's Testimony 0 about the mirror being there during the incident is contradicted by the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) which shows a folding screen. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 0 and Evidence 12. But the user asked for testimony and evidence pairs.

Wait, Testimony 0 states there was a mirror dividing the two halves. Evidence 12's Crime Photo shows a folding screen separating the tables. Therefore, the evidence (12) contradicts Testimony 0. So the pair would be Evidence 12 and Testimony 0. But let's check if there's another possible contradiction.

Looking at Testimony 2: Armstrong says the seat next to the victim's table where the old man was sitting is the only one where you could see the victim. But the floor plans (Evidence 11) or the crime photo (12) might show that the view from that seat is blocked. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, looking at Evidence 11, which might indicate that the layout is different. Alternatively, maybe Evidence 11 contradicts Testimony 1 or 2. Let's see.

Another angle: Testimony 3 says Armstrong moved the mirror after the incident. But if the mirror was moved, then the position in the crime photo (Evidence 12) taken at the time of the incident should show the mirror. However, the crime photo shows a folding screen instead. Therefore, the mirror wasn't present during the incident, contradicting Testimony 0. Therefore, Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) contradicts Testimony 0 (which claims the mirror was in the middle). So the correct pair is Evidence 12 and Testimony 0.

But wait, in the crime photo's caption, it says "Two dining tables are separated by a folding screen." So if the mirror was there during the incident, but the photo taken at the scene shows a folding screen instead, that's a contradiction. Therefore, Armstrong's testimony about the mirror is contradicted by the physical evidence of the folding screen in the crime photo. Therefore, the answer should be Evidence 12 and Testimony 0.

{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 0}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let's start by going through the testimonies and the evidences one by one.

First, looking at the testimonies provided. Testimony 2 from Armstrong says that the old man arrived just after 2 PM. Wait, but the victim's time of death is between 1:30 and 2:30 PM according to Evidence 10 (Glen's Autopsy Report). So if the old man arrived after 2 PM, and the poisoning happened 5 minutes after the victim found out about the lottery (Testimony 4 and 5), then the time of death would be after 2:05 PM. But the autopsy allows death as early as 1:30 PM. Hmm, maybe that's a contradiction? Wait, no, because the time of death is a range. Maybe another angle.

Looking at Evidence 3: Sports Paper from Dec 3rd (day of incident) with a doodle by the victim. The doodle mentions 'MC Bomber' with 100,000 crossed out, and laughter. Evidence 23 is the MC Bomber disc, a computer virus made by Glen, worth millions. So the victim had a connection to that. Also, Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar) notes a meeting with "The Tiger" (Furio Tigre) on Dec 3rd. And Evidence 6 (Small Bottle) has Furio's fingerprints. So Furio might have been involved.

Now, looking at Testimony 0: Armstrong says the victim came to the restaurant alone. But Evidence 20 says Glen had a meeting with The Tiger (Furio) that day. So if Glen was meeting Furio at Tres Bien, then he wouldn't have been alone. But according to Armstrong's Testimony 0, Glen was alone. That's a contradiction here. Because if he was there to meet Furio, then Furio should have been there. But Testimony 0 claims he came alone. However, Testimony 1 and 2 mention an old man arriving after Glen. The old man could be someone else, maybe Victor Kudo or another person. Wait, the old man in Testimony 1 and 2 is not identified yet. But Glen was supposed to meet Furio. If Armstrong's testimony says Glen came alone, but the calendar says he had a meeting, that's a contradiction. The evidence that shows the meeting (Evidence 20) would contradict Testimony 0. So Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar) says he had a meeting with The Tiger (Furio) on the day of the incident. But Armstrong's Testimony 0 says Glen came alone. So that's a contradiction. 

Wait, but Testimony 1 says the old man arrived not long after Glen. Testimony 2 specifies the old man arrived just after 2 PM. If "The Tiger" (Furio) was supposed to meet Glen, but according to Armstrong, Glen came alone, then that's a contradiction. But maybe the old man is Furio? But Armstrong might not know Furio's nickname. Alternatively, the meeting might have been elsewhere. Hmm.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 3 from Armstrong: "Z'ere were no other customers." But Evidence 7 (Victor's Note) and Victor's Testimony (18) indicate Victor was present. Wait, Victor Kudo was in Tres Bien at the time (Character 7). So Testimony 3 by Armstrong says there were no other customers, but Victor was there. That's a contradiction. So Evidence 9 (Victor's Note) or Victor's presence would contradict Testimony 3. But Victor's presence is part of the character list, not evidence. Wait, Testimony 18 is Victor's Testimony: he broke the vase at his seat. So if Victor was present, then Testimony 3 (no other customers) is false. Therefore, Testimony 3 (no other customers) contradicts the fact that Victor was there. But how is that represented in evidence? Evidence 18 (Victor's Testimony) says he was there. So Evidence 18 and Testimony 3 contradict each other. But Evidence 18 is a testimony, not an evidence. Wait, the user is asking for evidence and testimony that contradict. So perhaps the testimony from Armstrong (Testimony 3) saying there were no other customers contradicts the evidence that Victor was present, like Victor's Testimony (Testimony 18). But Testimony 18 is not evidence. Wait, the user provided Evidences and Testimonies as separate lists. So the Evidences include things like Victor's Note (Evidence 9) which says "Convicted before, a wicked man or woman, repeat offender -- Victor Kudo". That might not directly place him at the scene. But according to the Characters list, Victor Kudo was in Tres Bien at the time of the incident. So if Armstrong's Testimony 3 says there were no other customers, but Victor was present, then that's a contradiction. However, the character list is background info, not evidence. So perhaps the actual evidence that places Victor there is Testimony 18 (Victor's own testimony) which is part of the testimonies, not evidence. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, the user says "Which evidence and testimony contradict each other?" So the contradiction must be between an evidence item and a testimony. So looking for a testimony that says something, and an evidence that proves it wrong.

Another angle: Testimony 2 from Armstrong: old man arrived just after 2 PM. But the victim's time of death is between 1:30-2:30 PM. If the old man arrived after 2 PM, but the poisoning happened 5 minutes after the lottery win (Testimony 4 and 5), which was after the old man arrived. So if the victim died at, say, 2:05 PM, but the autopsy allows death as early as 1:30 PM. Wait, but that's not necessarily a contradiction. Maybe not.

Looking at Evidence 3 (Sports Paper) with the doodle by the victim. The doodle has 'MC Bomber' and '100,000' crossed out, with laughter. Evidence 23 (MC Bomber disc) is a virus worth millions. The victim might have been planning something with that, but Furio's fingerprints are on the victim's ear medicine (Evidence 6). Also, Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar) mentions meeting The Tiger (Furio) on the day. So if Armstrong's Testimony 0 says Glen came alone, but Evidence 20 says he was supposed to meet Furio, that's a contradiction. Therefore, Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar) contradicts Testimony 0 (Glen came alone). So the pair would be Evidence 20 and Testimony 0.

Alternatively, Testimony 3 (no other customers) contradicts Evidence 18 (Victor's Testimony that he was present). But Testimony 18 is part of the testimonies, not evidence. The actual evidence would be, for example, Victor's Note (Evidence 9), but that's about his criminal record, not presence. Alternatively, the character list says Victor was present, but that's not evidence. Hmm.

Alternatively, Evidence 24 (Tres Bien Matches found at Tender Lender) could link the locations, but not sure.

Wait, the initial problem says the user must output one pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other. Let me check again.

Testimony 3: "Z'ere were no other customers." But according to the Characters list, Victor Kudo was present. Also, in the Evidences, Testimony 18 (Victor's Testimony) states he was there and broke a vase. So if Armstrong says no other customers, but Victor was there, that's a contradiction. But Testimony 18 is a testimony, not evidence. So perhaps the evidence that contradicts Testimony 3 is Evidence 18? Wait, no. Evidence 18 is "Victor's Testimony", but in the given data, Testimonies are separate. Wait, in the user's input, Testimony 18 is a testimony given by Victor, which is under Testimonies. The Evidences are separate. So the actual evidence that Victor was present is not listed as an evidence, but as a character. Therefore, this might not count. So maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.

Looking at Evidence 3 (Sports Paper) and Testimony 4. The doodle on the Sports Paper says 'MC Bomber' with 100k crossed out and laughing. The victim was meeting The Tiger (Furio) according to Evidence 20. If the victim was planning to sell MC Bomber, which is worth millions (Evidence 23), then the crossed out 100k suggests he changed the price. But Testimony 4 says when the victim found out he won the lottery (Evidence 14: Victim's Lottery Ticket worth half a million), he got excited. But the lottery ticket is found on Maggey. So maybe the lottery ticket was stolen. But how does that contradict a testimony?

Alternatively, Testimony 5: the poisoning occurred 5 minutes after the lottery win. But the autopsy says time of death is between 1:30-2:30. If the lottery win was announced after 2 PM (since old man arrived after 2 PM according to Testimony 2), then death would be around 2:05 PM, which is within the time frame. So no contradiction.

Back to the initial thought: Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar note about meeting The Tiger on Dec 3) contradicts Testimony 0 (Glen came alone). So if Glen was supposed to meet someone, but Testimony 0 says he came alone, that's a contradiction. Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 20 and Testimony 0.

{"evidence": 20, "testimony": 0}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this. So, the task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The characters, evidences, and testimonies are all provided, and I need to find a pair where the evidence directly contradicts a testimony.

First, I'll go through each testimony and see what they're claiming. Then, I'll check the evidences to see if any of them provide information that directly conflicts with that testimony.

Looking at the testimonies given by Tigre:

Testimony 0: "I don't know nothin' about no murder." But I need to check if any evidence shows he was involved.

Testimony 1: He claims he was in his office all of December last year. Any evidence placing him elsewhere?

Testimony 2: On the day of the incident (Dec 3rd), he says he was in the office and never saw the victim (Glen Elg). Evidence that he was at Tres Bien or interacted with Glen?

Testimony 3: Whales borrowing cash every day. Maybe related to Tender Lender's business, not sure.

Testimony 4: Alibi check with Violetta. Maybe evidence that Violetta wasn't there or something else.

Now looking at the evidence:

Evidence 6: Small Bottle. It's the victim's ear medicine, found in the kitchen with Furio Tigre's fingerprints. So if the bottle has Tigre's prints, that means he handled it. But according to Testimony 2, Tigre claims he was in his office and never saw the victim. But the victim's medicine bottle has Tigre's fingerprints, implying he was in contact with the bottle, possibly at the crime scene (Tres Bien's kitchen). That contradicts his testimony that he never saw Glen Elg (the victim) and was in his office all day.

Another point: Evidence 20 is Glen's Calendar, which notes a meeting with "The Tiger" on Dec 3rd. "The Tiger" is Tigre's nickname (Evidence 10's description). So that calendar entry suggests that Glen was supposed to meet Tigre on the day of the incident. That directly contradicts Tigre's Testimony 2 where he says he never saw the victim before.

So, which evidence and testimony pair contradicts? Evidence 20 and Testimony 2. Evidence 20 shows Glen had a meeting with Tigre on the day, which conflicts with Tigre's claim that he never saw the victim.

Alternatively, Evidence 6 (fingerprints) shows Tigre touched the victim's medicine bottle, which would mean he was at the scene, contradicting his alibi of being in the office.

Wait, but the location of the small bottle is the kitchen of Tres Bien. So if the bottle is there with Tigre's fingerprints, that places him at the crime scene. But Tigre's Testimony 2 says he was in the office and never saw the victim. So if he was in the kitchen, he would have been at Tres Bien, which contradicts his testimony.

So the contradiction here is between Evidence 6 (Small Bottle with Tigre's prints) and Testimony 2 (Tigre saying he was in the office and never saw the victim). The fingerprints on the bottle show he handled it, implying he was present at Tres Bien's kitchen, where the bottle was found. Therefore, he wasn't in his office as claimed.

Another possible contradiction is Evidence 24 (Tres Bien Matches found at Tender Lender). But not sure how that directly contradicts any testimony.

Also, Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar) says he was meeting "The Tiger" (Tigre) on the day of the incident. So if Tigre says he didn't see the victim, but the calendar entry suggests a meeting, that's a contradiction. So Evidence 20 vs Testimony 2.

So which is the stronger contradiction? Let's check.

Evidence 20 is Glen's calendar entry. It's possible that the meeting didn't happen, or that "The Tiger" is someone else, but given that Tigre is known as "The Tiger" (Evidence 10), it's likely referring to him. So if Tigre claims he never saw Glen, but Glen had a meeting scheduled with him, that's a contradiction.

Alternatively, the presence of Tigre's fingerprints on the victim's medicine bottle (Evidence 6) directly shows that he handled the bottle, which would mean he was in the kitchen, contradicting his testimony of being in the office.

So which is the correct pair? Let's check the testimony numbers.

Testimony 2: "The day youse talkin' about, I was in de office, too. I never saw that kid before." So the day of the incident, Dec 3rd, Tigre claims he was in the office and never saw Glen.

Evidence 6: The small bottle (victim's ear medicine) has Tigre's fingerprints. If the bottle was in Tres Bien's kitchen, and Tigre's prints are on it, that suggests he was there. So this contradicts Testimony 2.

But also Evidence 20: Glen's calendar entry for Dec 3rd says "Meet with The Tiger". If The Tiger is Tigre, then this would imply they were supposed to meet, which contradicts Tigre's statement that he never saw Glen.

So two possible contradictions. But which one is more direct?

The fingerprints on the bottle directly link Tigre to the crime scene, which is Tres Bien. If he was there, then his claim of being in the office is false. The calendar entry is a plan, but maybe the meeting didn't happen. However, the fingerprints are physical evidence placing him at the scene, which directly contradicts his alibi.

Therefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 6 (Small Bottle with Tigre's fingerprints) and Testimony 2 (Tigre's claim he was in the office and never saw the victim).

Wait, but Testimony 2 says he was in the office and never saw the victim. The fingerprints on the victim's medicine bottle don't necessarily mean he saw the victim, but handling the bottle could have happened elsewhere. But the bottle was found in the kitchen of Tres Bien. So if the bottle is there, and Tigre's prints are on it, that suggests he was in the kitchen, which is part of the crime scene. So that would contradict his alibi of being in his office at Tender Lender.

But wait, Tender Lender is a different location. Tres Bien is the restaurant where the murder happened. So if Tigre was in Tres Bien's kitchen (where the bottle was found), that's a different location from his office. Thus, his alibi of being in the office is contradicted by the fingerprints on the bottle in the crime scene's kitchen.

Therefore, Evidence 6 and Testimony 2 contradict each other.

Alternatively, Evidence 24: Tres Bien Matches found at Tender Lender. If the matches from Tres Bien are in Tigre's office, that might link him to the scene, but perhaps that's more circumstantial.

So the most direct contradiction is Evidence 6 (Tigre's fingerprints on the victim's medicine bottle in Tres Bien's kitchen) and Testimony 2 (Tigre claims he was in his office and never saw the victim).

Therefore, the answer is {"evidence": 6, "testimony": 2}

{"evidence": 6, "testimony": 2}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The characters and evidences are a lot, but let's start by going through each testimony and cross-checking with the evidence.

Testimony 0 to 4 are all from Tigre (Furio Tigre). Let's look at each one.

Testimony 0: Tigre says he never met Glen Elg. But Evidence 20 is Glen's calendar which has a note on Dec 3rd (the day of the incident) saying "Meet with The Tiger". Since Tigre's nickname is "The Tiger", this suggests they had a meeting planned. That contradicts Tigre's claim that he never met Glen.

Testimony 1: Tigre mentions a guy wanting to borrow cash, which could align with the loan company. But Evidence 20 still shows they were supposed to meet.

Testimony 2: He says he set up a meeting at his office (Tender Lender). But Evidence 3 is a sports paper from Dec 3rd with a doodle by the victim pointing to 'MC Bomber' and 100k crossed out. Also, Evidence 23 is MC Bomber, a virus program made by Glen. Maybe the meeting was about that, not a loan. But Tigre's testimonies 2 and 3 say he waited but Glen didn't show. However, the victim was at Tres Bien, so maybe the meeting was there instead? But according to Evidence 3, the victim was at Tres Bien and left the doodle there. If the meeting was supposed to be at Tender Lender, but the victim went to Tres Bien, then Tigre's claim that Glen didn't show up would be true. Wait, but Evidence 6 (Small Bottle) has Furio Tigre's fingerprints. The bottle was found in the kitchen of Tres Bien. So if Tigre says he was never at Tres Bien (Testimony 4: "I ain't never been to that Tres Bien joint"), but his fingerprints are on the victim's ear medicine in Tres Bien's kitchen, that's a contradiction. So Evidence 6 (fingerprints) vs Testimony 4 (never been there). That's a direct contradiction. So Evidence 6 and Testimony 4 contradict each other. That's the pair.

{"evidence": 6, "testimony": 4}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let me go through each testimony and see if any evidence directly contradicts it.

First, looking at the testimonies given by Tigre (Testimony 0 to 3). Let's check each one against the evidence.

Testimony 0: Tigre says he was supposed to meet "wid the kid" at the restaurant that afternoon. The kid might be Glen Elg. Evidence 20 is Glen's calendar which notes a meeting with "The Tiger" on Dec 3rd, the day of the incident. Since Tigre is known as "The Tiger", this testimony aligns with the evidence. So no contradiction here.

Testimony 1: Tigre claims he opened the door and saw an ugly scene. The evidence includes the crime photo (12) showing the victim collapsed, which matches his statement. So no contradiction.

Testimony 2: He says the guy was stiff as concrete. The autopsy report (10) states death by poisoning, but stiffness (rigor mortis) takes time. However, time of death was between 1:30-2:30 PM. If Tigre arrived shortly after, maybe the body wasn't stiff yet. But this might not be a direct contradiction. Maybe not the strongest point.

Testimony 3: Tigre says he left because he thought the place would get hot. Then Testimony 4 says he heard sirens on his way out. However, Evidence 6 is the small bottle (victim's ear medicine) found in the kitchen with Tigre's fingerprints. If Tigre left immediately, how did his fingerprints get on the bottle? Because he must have handled it in the kitchen. But according to his testimony, he left right after seeing the body, implying he didn't go into the kitchen. But the bottle was found there with his prints. So that's a contradiction. The evidence (6) shows he was in the kitchen, but his testimony (3 and 4) says he left immediately. Therefore, evidence 6 contradicts testimony 3 or 4.

Wait, Testimony 3 is him splitting because the place was going to be hot. Testimony 4 is about hearing sirens. The key contradiction is that his fingerprints are on the bottle in the kitchen, which he shouldn't have touched if he left right away. So the testimony (3) says he split, but the evidence (6) shows he was in the kitchen, leaving fingerprints. Therefore, Evidence 6 contradicts Testimony 3, because he must have been in the kitchen to leave the prints, but he claims he left immediately.

{"evidence": 6, "testimony": 3}
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure this out. I need to find which piece of evidence contradicts one of the testimonies provided. Let's start by looking at the testimonies from Tigre and cross-checking them with the evidence.

Testimony 3 says: "I'm about to flatten the guy, when he starts screamin'." So Tigre claims he was about to attack Glen Elg because he couldn't pay the $100,000 loan, but then Glen won the lottery. But according to the evidence, let's see... 

Looking at Evidence 3: The Sports Paper from Dec 3rd has a doodle by the victim saying 'MC Bomber' with 100,000 crossed out and "Ahahahaha". This suggests that the victim was involved with MC Bomber, which is a computer virus (Evidence 23) worth millions. Also, Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar) mentions a meeting with "The Tiger" (Tigre) on the day of the incident. 

Wait, Evidence 23 says MC Bomber was a virus made by Glen and potentially worth millions. Tigre's testimonies 0-7 focus on the $100,000 debt. But in Testimony 4, Tigre says Glen won the lottery for half a million, which is why he didn't need to kill him. However, Evidence 3's doodle crossing out 100,000 and laughing might imply that the actual deal was about something bigger, like the million-dollar virus. 

So, if Tigre claims he only wanted the $100k (Testimony 7: "I was after the $100,000. I didn't have no other reason to kill the guy!"), but the victim had a virus worth millions, Tigre's motive could be bigger. Also, Evidence 23 shows that Glen created MC Bomber, and Tigre's company Tender Lender had the disc. Maybe Tigre wanted the virus for more money, contradicting his testimony that he only wanted the $100k. 

But wait, Evidence 3's doodle shows that the 100,000 was crossed out, which might mean the victim considered that amount irrelevant. If the victim had a half-million lottery ticket (Evidence 14) and a million-dollar virus, Tigre's insistence on only wanting the $100k could be a lie. Thus, Testimony 7 (Tigre saying he only wanted $100k) is contradicted by Evidence 23 (MC Bomber worth millions). Alternatively, the crossed-out 100k in Evidence 3's doodle might contradict Tigre's Testimony 0 where he says he loaned Elg $100k. Wait, Testimony 0 is Tigre saying he loaned Elg $100k. But if the victim had a lottery ticket for half a million (Evidence 14), why would he need a $100k loan? Maybe that's a contradiction. Or perhaps the fact that the victim had a meeting with "The Tiger" (Evidence 20) which is Tigre, but Tigre's testimonies don't mention that meeting. Hmm.

Wait, Testimony 0 says Tigre loaned Elg $100k. But Evidence 3's doodle has the victim crossing out 100k and laughing. Maybe that suggests the debt was already settled or was a joke. Alternatively, the victim had the lottery ticket worth half a million (Evidence 14), so he could have paid back the 100k, but Tigre killed him to take the ticket. But the autopsy says he was poisoned. Also, the virus (Evidence 23) is worth millions, so Tigre's motive could be bigger than the $100k, contradicting his Testimony 7.

So the contradiction would be between Tigre's Testimony 7 (only after $100k) and Evidence 23 (MC Bomber worth millions). Alternatively, Evidence 3's doodle showing the 100k crossed out and the virus being worth millions. But the user wants one pair. Let's check the exact wording.

Testimony 7: "I was after the $100,000. I didn't have no other reason to kill the guy!" But if MC Bomber is worth millions, Tigre had a bigger motive. Thus, Evidence 23 contradicts Testimony 7. But Evidence 3's doodle also shows that the victim had crossed out the 100k, possibly implying that the debt was resolved or that there was another deal. 

Alternatively, Evidence 3's doodle is from the victim, which shows that the 100k was crossed out and he was laughing, which might suggest that he didn't owe the 100k anymore. But Testimony 0 says Tigre loaned him 100k. If the victim crossed it out, maybe he paid it back, but according to Testimony 4, the victim won the lottery, which could have allowed him to pay. But Tigre says in Testimony 6 that thanks to Maggey's actions (the poisoning), his business with Glen was over. Wait, if Glen had the half million, he could have paid back the 100k, so Tigre would have no reason to kill him. But the murder happened, so perhaps Tigre wanted more. But the contradiction here is between Tigre's claim that he only wanted the 100k and the existence of the million-dollar virus. Therefore, Evidence 23 contradicts Testimony 7. So the answer would be evidence 23 and testimony 7. But let me check the evidence numbers again.

Looking at the list:

Evidence 23: MC Bomber, worth millions. Testimony 7: Tigre says he only wanted 100k.

Yes, that's a contradiction. So the JSON would be {"evidence": 23, "testimony": 7}. But let me make sure. Alternatively, another possible contradiction: Evidence 14 (Victim's Lottery Ticket) is half a million, which Tigre mentions in Testimony 4. But he says thanks to Maggey's actions (killing him?), his business was over. Wait, but if Glen had the ticket, Tigre could take it as payment. However, the presence of the virus (Evidence 23) worth millions suggests a larger motive, which contradicts Tigre's claim in Testimony 7. So the answer should be evidence 23 and testimony 7.

{"evidence": 23, "testimony": 7}
====================================================================================================

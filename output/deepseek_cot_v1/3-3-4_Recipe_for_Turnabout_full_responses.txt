Okay, let's try to figure this out. The task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. I need to look through all the provided testimonies and evidence to spot inconsistencies.

First, let's look at the testimonies given by Armstrong (Testimony 0 to 3). Testimony 0 says there was a mirror in the middle of the restaurant dividing the two halves. Testimony 1 mentions there's only one seat from which you could have seen an image of the victim. Testimony 2 points out that seat was at the table next to the victim's where the old man was sitting. Testimony 3 says Armstrong moved the mirror after the incident but didn't touch anything else.

Now, looking at the evidence. Evidence 11 is the Tres Bien Floor Plans, which show the view from the entrance is obstructed and could only see the patio. Then there's Evidence 12, the Crime Photo, which describes the scene with two dining tables separated by a folding screen. The photo shows an intact vase on each table. Also, Victor's Testimony (Evidence 18) mentions breaking a vase at his seat. Wait, but in the crime photo, the vases are intact. That seems like a contradiction. But Victor is Testimony 18, which isn't part of Armstrong's testimonies here. The focus here is on Armstrong's testimonies.

Wait, the user wants a contradiction between evidence and one of the testimonies listed (Testimonies 0-4 by Armstrong). Let's check each testimony against the evidence.

Testimony 3 says Armstrong moved the mirror but didn't touch anything else. But Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) shows that in the crime scene photo, there's a folding screen separating the tables, and the mirror isn't mentioned. Wait, maybe the floor plans (Evidence 11) say the view from the entrance is obstructed and could only see the patio. Testimony 0 mentions a mirror dividing the restaurant, but the floor plans mention a folding screen. Wait, maybe the mirror and the folding screen are conflicting. Because if the floor plans show a folding screen, but Armstrong says there was a mirror dividing the restaurant, that would be a contradiction. But Testimony 0 (Armstrong) says "La mirror, it was in z'e middle of la restaurant, dividing z'e two 'alves." But Evidence 11's floor plans mention a folding screen. So if the floor plans show a folding screen instead of a mirror, that contradicts Armstrong's testimony about the mirror. So the evidence (11) and testimony (0) would contradict. But the user wants only one pair. Alternatively, Testimony 3 says he moved the mirror after the incident. But the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows the scene as it was when the crime happened. If the mirror was moved after, but the photo taken during the crime shows the folding screen, that might not align. Wait, the crime photo is taken from near the kitchen and shows two tables separated by a folding screen, not a mirror. So if Armstrong says there was a mirror dividing the two halves, but the floor plans and crime photo show a folding screen, that's a contradiction. So Evidence 11 (Floor Plans) contradicts Testimony 0 (Armstrong's statement about the mirror). But Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) also shows the folding screen. So the contradiction is between Armstrong's Testimony 0 (mirror in the middle) and the Floor Plans (Evidence 11) or the Crime Photo (Evidence 12). The user might expect that the mirror and folding screen are different. For example, Armstrong says the mirror divided the restaurant, but the floor plans and crime photo show a folding screen. Therefore, Armstrong's testimony about the mirror is contradicted by the evidence showing a folding screen. Hence, Evidence 11 (Tres Bien Floor Plans) contradicts Testimony 0. Alternatively, Testimony 3 says he moved the mirror after the incident, but if the crime photo (taken after the incident but before moving the mirror?) shows a folding screen, that might not add up. Wait, the crime photo is taken at the time of the incident. If the mirror was there during the incident but the photo shows a folding screen, that's a contradiction. So maybe Armstrong is lying about the mirror being there during the crime. The floor plans (Evidence 11) say the view from the entrance is obstructed and could only see the patio, which might align with the folding screen. So the contradiction is between Armstrong's Testimony 0 (mirror dividing the restaurant) and Evidence 11 (floor plans showing a folding screen instead of a mirror). Therefore, the correct pair is evidence 11 and testimony 0. But looking back, the answer needs to be a pair. Wait, the user says "Which evidence and testimony contradict each other?" So the answer is one evidence number and one testimony number. Let me check the numbering again. Testimony 3 says Armstrong moved the mirror after the incident. If the mirror was moved after the incident, then the crime photo (taken during the incident) should show the mirror. But according to Evidence 12 (Crime Photo), there's a folding screen. So if the mirror was present during the crime, the photo should have shown the mirror. But the photo shows a folding screen. Therefore, Armstrong's Testimony 0 (mirror was there during the incident) is contradicted by Evidence 12 (Crime Photo showing folding screen). Alternatively, Testimony 3 says he moved the mirror after the incident, which would mean during the crime, the mirror was there. But the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows a folding screen. Therefore, this would mean that either the mirror was replaced by a folding screen, which contradicts Armstrong's statement. Therefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 0 (mirror present during the crime) and Evidence 12 (Crime Photo showing a folding screen). But Evidence 11's Floor Plans also show the folding screen. So either Evidence 11 or 12 contradicts Testimony 0. Let me check the descriptions again. Evidence 11: Tres Bien Floor Plans. Blueprints show the view from the entrance is obstructed and could only see the patio. The floor plans would show the layout, including the folding screen. So if the floor plans have a folding screen but Armstrong says there was a mirror, then Evidence 11 contradicts Testimony 0. Alternatively, the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) taken during the incident shows a folding screen, which would contradict Armstrong's Testimony 0. So which is it? Let's see. Testimony 0: Armstrong says there was a mirror dividing the restaurant. But the floor plans (Evidence 11) show that the view from the entrance is obstructed and could only see the patio, which might be due to the folding screen. Therefore, the floor plans (Evidence 11) contradict Testimony 0. Alternatively, the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows the folding screen, which contradicts Armstrong's claim about the mirror. So, which is the correct contradiction? The answer is likely Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) and Testimony 0 (mirror present). But Evidence 12's description says that the two tables are separated by a folding screen. Therefore, the presence of the folding screen in the crime photo (Evidence 12) directly contradicts Armstrong's Testimony 0 which mentions a mirror. Therefore, the pair is Evidence 12 and Testimony 0. However, let's check the testimonies again. Testimony 3 says that after the incident, Armstrong moved the mirror. So during the incident, the mirror was there. But the crime photo taken at the time of the incident shows a folding screen. Therefore, this is a contradiction. Thus, the correct pair is Evidence 12 (Crime Photo showing folding screen) and Testimony 0 (mirror was in the middle). So, the JSON answer would be {"evidence": 12, "testimony": 0}. But wait, the user might have another angle. Alternatively, Testimony 3: After the incident, he moved the mirror. If the mirror was moved after, then the crime photo taken during the incident should show the mirror. But the photo shows a folding screen, implying that during the incident, there was no mirror but a folding screen, contradicting Testimony 0. So yes, Testimony 0 says mirror was there during the crime, but Evidence 12 (photo taken during the crime) shows a folding screen. Hence, contradiction between Evidence 12 and Testimony 0. That's the pair.

{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 0}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants just one pair. Let me start by going through the testimonies and the evidences to spot any inconsistencies.

First, looking at the testimonies from Armstrong (Testimonies 0 to 6). Testimony 2 says the old man (Victor Kudo?) arrived just after 2 PM. But the victim's autopsy report (Evidence 10) states time of death between 1:30 and 2:30 PM. Wait, but how does that contradict? Maybe not directly. Let me check others.

Testimony 3 by Armstrong claims there were no other customers. But Evidence 9 is Victor's Note, which suggests Victor was there. Also, Victor's Testimony (Evidence 18) mentions he broke a vase at his seat. So if Victor was present, then Testimony 3 saying there were no other customers is a lie. That seems like a contradiction. Because Victor was a customer and was present, so Testimony 3 is false. Therefore, Evidence 18 (Victor's Testimony) contradicts Testimony 3.

Wait, Evidence 18 is Victor's own testimony where he says he broke the vase. So if Armstrong says there were no other customers, but Victor was there and even broke a vase, that's a contradiction. So the testimony from Armstrong (Testimony 3) that says "Z'ere were no other customers" is contradicted by Victor's Testimony (Evidence 18), which places Victor at the scene. So the pair would be Testimony 3 and Evidence 18. But wait, Evidence 18 is a testimony from Victor, but the user is asking for a contradiction between evidence and testimony. Wait, no. The user said "evidence and testimonies contradict each other". So the testimony is Armstrong's (Testimony 3), and the evidence could be something else. Let me check.

Alternatively, Evidence 7 (Victor's Note) might not directly state he was present. But Victor's Testimony (Evidence 18) is an actual testimony from Victor. However, maybe the evidence that Victor was present is another piece. Wait, the testimonies are separate from the evidence. The evidence includes Victor's Note (Evidence 9) which is a note that says "Convicted before, a wicked man or woman, repeat offender -- Victor Kudo". That doesn't directly place him at the scene. But Victor's Testimony (Evidence 18) is part of the evidence? Wait, no. Wait, in the provided data, Testimonies are listed separately. The user provided Testimonies 0-6, which are all from Armstrong. Then, there's Evidence 18 which is "Victor's Testimony" stating he broke the vase. So Evidence 18 is part of the evidence list, not the testimony list. So the contradiction is between Armstrong's Testimony 3 ("no other customers") and Evidence 18 (Victor's testimony that he was there and broke a vase). Therefore, the evidence is 18, and the testimony is 3. That would be the pair. Alternatively, maybe another piece of evidence places Victor at the scene. For example, the Sports Paper (Evidence 3) left by a customer on Dec 3rd. But Victor's presence is confirmed by his own testimony (Evidence 18). So the contradiction is between Armstrong's Testimony 3 and Evidence 18. Therefore, the answer should be evidence 18 and testimony 3. Let me check the numbering again. Testimony 3 is "Z'ere were no other customers." Evidence 18 is Victor's Testimony: "When the incident occurred, I broke the vase at my seat. I'm sorry." So this directly places Victor at the scene, contradicting Armstrong's statement that there were no other customers. Therefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 18 and Testimony 3. So the JSON would be {"evidence": 18, "testimony": 3}.

{"evidence": 18, "testimony": 3}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence contradicts one of the testimonies provided. Let me start by going through each testimony and see if any of the evidence directly contradicts it.

First, looking at the testimonies from Tigre. Testimony 0 says he doesn't know anything about the murder. Testimony 1 claims he was busy in his office all of December. Testimony 2 says he was in the office that day and never saw the victim (Glen Elg). Testimony 3 mentions that Tender Lender has lots of clients every day. Testimony 4 tells us to check his alibi with Violetta.

Now, looking at the evidence. Let's check Evidence 20: Glen's Calendar. It has a note on Dec 3rd (the day of the incident) saying "Meet with The Tiger". "The Tiger" is Furio Tigre's nickname. So if Glen had a meeting scheduled with Tigre on that day, but Tigre's Testimony 2 says he never saw Glen before, that's a contradiction. Because the calendar suggests they were supposed to meet, implying Tigre should have seen him, but he's denying it.

Another possible point: Evidence 23 is MC Bomber found at Tender Lender. The Magazine Clipping (Evidence 2) mentions 'MC Bomber' with a doodle. But I'm not sure if that directly contradicts a testimony. Let me check the testimonies again. Maybe Testimony 1 where Tigre says he was in his office all December. If there's evidence linking him elsewhere, but Evidence 23 is at his place. Hmm, maybe not the strongest.

Alternatively, Evidence 25 is a repair bill paid by Tigre to the Cadaverini Family. But how does that relate to his testimonies? Maybe not directly. Let's focus on the calendar. The key contradiction is Glen's Calendar entry for meeting The Tiger on the day of the murder, but Tigre claims he never saw Glen. That seems like a direct contradiction. So Evidence 20 contradicts Testimony 2.

{"evidence": 20, "testimony": 2}
Okay, let's see. I need to find which evidence contradicts one of the testimonies provided. The characters, evidences, and testimonies are all part of a case, probably from a Phoenix Wright game. Let me start by going through each testimony and checking against the evidence to find inconsistencies.

First, looking at the testimonies by Tigre. Testimony 0 says he never met Glen Elg. But Evidence 20 is Glen's calendar, which notes a meeting with "The Tiger" on the day of the incident. Since Tigre is known as "The Tiger" (Character 10), that seems like a contradiction. So Tigre claims he never met Glen, but the victim's calendar indicates they had a meeting scheduled.

Then, Testimony 2 mentions that Tigre set up a meeting at his office, Tender Lender, but he waited and Glen didn't show. However, Evidence 20 shows the meeting was scheduled, and maybe there's more. Also, Evidence 24 are Tres Bien matches found at Tender Lender, which might link Tigre to Tres Bien, but Testimony 4 says he's never been there. Wait, the question is about contradictions between evidence and testimony. So if Evidence 24 is matches from Tres Bien found at Tigre's office, but he claims he's never been there (Testimony 4), that could imply he was there or had someone bring them. But maybe the key contradiction is between Testimony 0 (Tigre never met Glen) and Evidence 20 (Glen had a meeting with The Tiger). Because "The Tiger" is Tigre's nickname, so the meeting was set, which contradicts Tigre's claim of never meeting Glen. But according to Testimony 2, Tigre says he set up a meeting but Glen didn't show. Wait, but Testimony 0 is "I ain't no liar. I never met Glen Elg." So he's saying he never met him. But in Testimony 2, he says he set up a meeting but Glen didn't show. So maybe he didn't actually meet Glen, just scheduled it. Then that's not a contradiction. Hmm. But Evidence 20 says Glen had a note to meet The Tiger on Dec 3rd. So if Tigre set up a meeting but Glen didn't come, maybe the meeting didn't happen. But the contradiction would be if there's evidence that they did meet. Alternatively, maybe another piece of evidence. Let's check other evidences.

Evidence 23 is MC Bomber found at Tender Lender, which is a virus program. Maybe connected to Glen's work as a programmer? Also, Evidence 25 is a repair bill paid by Tigre to Cadaverini. Not directly related. Evidence 24: Tres Bien matches at Tender Lender. If Tigre claims he's never been to Tres Bien (Testimony 4), but his office has matches from there, that suggests someone from his office was there. But maybe that's a stretch. Alternatively, Evidence 20 (Glen's calendar) vs Testimony 0 (never met Glen). But if the meeting was scheduled but didn't happen, then Tigre didn't lie. Wait, Testimony 2: Tigre says he set up a meeting with Glen at Tender Lender, but Glen didn't show. So the meeting was arranged but not attended. Then Glen's calendar note "Meet with The Tiger" would align with that. So maybe that's not a contradiction. Then perhaps another testimony. Let's see Testimony 4: "I ain't never been to that Tres Bien joint, youse hear?" But Evidence 24 is Tres Bien matches found at Tender Lender. If Tigre's office has Tres Bien matches, perhaps implying that someone from his office went there. But Tigre himself might not have gone. Alternatively, the matches could be from someone else. Not sure if that's a direct contradiction. Alternatively, Evidence 3 is a sports paper from Dec 3rd with a doodle about MC Bomber and 100,000 crossed out. The MC Bomber is a virus (Evidence 23). If Tigre's involved with that, but he denies knowing Glen, maybe there's a link. Alternatively, looking at Testimony 3: "I waited around for him, but he ain't ever showed." If Evidence 20 shows the meeting was on Dec 3rd, and the incident was that day. But the victim died between 1:30 and 2:30 PM (Evidence 10). The Millionaire Radio Flyer (Evidence 19) is at 1:30 PM. So perhaps Glen was at Tres Bien during the meeting time, which would mean he didn't go to Tender Lender. So Tigre's statement that Glen didn't show up might be true. So maybe that's not the contradiction. Wait, but if Glen was at Tres Bien during the time he was supposed to meet Tigre, then he didn't show up, which supports Tigre's testimony. So where's the contradiction?

Looking back, maybe Testimony 4: Tigre claims he never went to Tres Bien. But Evidence 24 are Tres Bien matches found at Tender Lender. But the matches could have been brought by someone else. Unless there's evidence that Tigre was there. Alternatively, maybe the repair bill (Evidence 25) connects him to Cadaverini, but that's not directly related. Let's think again. The key is to find one evidence and one testimony that directly contradict each other. The most straightforward is Evidence 20 (Glen's calendar note to meet The Tiger on Dec 3) and Testimony 0 (Tigre says he never met Glen). But Tigre's testimony 0 is "never met", but he arranged a meeting. So if they never met, the meeting didn't happen. But the calendar note could be about the scheduled meeting. So perhaps no direct contradiction. But maybe another angle. If the meeting was supposed to be at Tender Lender, but Glen was at Tres Bien during the time, so he couldn't have gone. So maybe the calendar note was a mistake. Alternatively, maybe Tigre actually met Glen at Tres Bien. Wait, the crime happened at Tres Bien. So if Glen was there, maybe Tigre was there too. But according to Testimony 4, he says he never went there. If there's evidence placing him at Tres Bien, that would contradict. But the matches (Evidence 24) are at Tender Lender, not necessarily placing Tigre at Tres Bien. Hmm.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 2: Tigre says the meeting was set at Tender Lender. But Evidence 20 says Glen noted "Meet with The Tiger", but maybe the meeting was actually at Tres Bien? Let me check Evidence 20 again. The note on Glen's calendar is "Meet with The Tiger". The time isn't specified. If the meeting was supposed to be at Tender Lender (as per Tigre's Testimony 2), but Glen was at Tres Bien during the time of death (1:30-2:30 PM), then perhaps he went to Tres Bien for the meeting instead. But if Tigre claims he was waiting at Tender Lender, and the meeting didn't happen, but the actual meeting place was Tres Bien, then that's a contradiction. But how does Evidence 20 indicate the location? It doesn't. The meeting with The Tiger could be at Tres Bien. Wait, but according to Tigre's Testimony 2, the meeting was at Tender Lender. So if there's evidence that Glen was meeting The Tiger at Tres Bien, that would contradict. But Evidence 20 just says "Meet with The Tiger" without location. So perhaps no. Hmm.

Alternatively, Evidence 3: Sports paper from Dec 3rd with a doodle about MC Bomber. Evidence 23 is MC Bomber at Tender Lender. So maybe Tigre is involved with MC Bomber. But how does that contradict his testimony?

Alternatively, let's check Testimony 4 again: Tigre says he never been to Tres Bien. But Evidence 7 is the scooter ridden by the phony, which is connected to Maggey's case. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, Evidence 24: Tres Bien matches found at Tender Lender. If Tigre's office has matches from Tres Bien, perhaps implying that someone from Tender Lender was there. If Tigre says he never went there, but his office has those matches, maybe he's lying. But it's possible that another person from his office brought them. Unless there's evidence directly linking him to Tres Bien. For example, the repair bill (Evidence 25) is paid to Cadaverini, who might be connected to Viola (Character 9). Not sure.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the user says "Which evidence and testimony contradict each other?" So the answer should be one pair where the evidence directly contradicts a testimony. Let's re-examine the testimonies and evidences.

Testimony 4: Tigre says he's never been to Tres Bien. Evidence 24: Tres Bien matches found at Tender Lender. If the matches are from Tres Bien and found in Tigre's office, that suggests a connection. But does it directly contradict his testimony? He might have gotten the matches without going there, like someone else brought them. So maybe not a direct contradiction.

Testimony 0: Tigre says he never met Glen. Evidence 20: Glen's calendar has a meeting with The Tiger. Since Tigre is The Tiger, this implies they had a meeting scheduled. But if the meeting didn't happen (as per Testimony 2), then they didn't meet. So the calendar note is just an appointment, not proof of meeting. So that's not a contradiction.

Wait, but Evidence 20's note is "Meet with The Tiger" on Dec 3, the day of the incident. The victim died that day. If the meeting was scheduled, but the victim died before the meeting, maybe they didn't meet. But Tigre's Testimony 0 says he never met Glen. If they never met, then there's no contradiction. Unless the meeting did happen. But how to prove that?

Wait, the victim's prescription bag (Evidence 17) is empty. Maybe he took his medicine before dying. But I'm not sure. Let's think about the murder method. The victim was poisoned with potassium cyanide in the coffee cup (Evidence 13). The cyanide was found in Maggey's apron (Evidence 16). But Maggey was framed. The real killer might be someone else.

Wait, perhaps the key contradiction is between Tigre's Testimony 4 (never been to Tres Bien) and Evidence 24 (Tres Bien matches at Tender Lender). But unless there's evidence that Tigre himself was there, this isn't a direct contradiction. Alternatively, Evidence 7 is the scooter ridden by the phony (the fake Phoenix). The scooter's wheel guard is smashed. Maybe connected to Tigre's movements. But I don't see the link.

Wait, the phony is the one who framed Maggey. The paper badge (Evidence 26) found at Tender Lender suggests that Tigre's people made a fake badge, implying the phony is connected to Tigre. So if the phony used the scooter (Evidence 7) to go to Tres Bien, then Tigre's people were involved, but Tigre claims he never went there. But that's indirect.

Alternatively, looking at the lunch special (Evidence 5) from Tres Bien. If Tigre had someone bring him the lunch, but that's not evidence.

Wait, another angle: Testimony 1 from Tigre says "There was some lame guy with that name, though. Wanted to borrow cash from me." So he acknowledges that Glen wanted to borrow money. Then in Testimony 2, he says he set up a meeting at his office. But Evidence 20 shows Glen had the meeting on his calendar. So the testimonies align. The contradiction must be elsewhere.

Wait, maybe Evidence 3: the sports paper from Dec 3rd with a doodle 'MC Bomber' pointing to 100,000 crossed out. The MC Bomber is a virus (Evidence 23) found at Tender Lender. The sports paper was left by a customer at Tres Bien. So someone at Tres Bien on Dec 3rd wrote about MC Bomber and 100k. If Tigre is involved with MC Bomber (as it's at his office), but he claims he never met Glen, but Glen was a programmer (victim's description). Maybe Glen was involved in creating the virus, hence the meeting. But how does that contradict testimony?

Alternatively, the victim's lottery ticket (Evidence 14) for half a million dollars. If he won that, maybe he was going to use it to pay off a debt. Jean's loan (Evidence 8) is half a million. But that's Jean's debt, not Glen's. Wait, Glen's autopsy report (Evidence 10) says he died of poisoning. His prescription bag (Evidence 17) is empty. The small bottle (Evidence 6) is his ear medicine with unknown fingerprints. Maybe the killer handled it.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Let's try to focus. The question is to find one pair where evidence directly contradicts a testimony.

Looking again:

Testimony 4: Tigre says he's never been to Tres Bien.

Evidence 24: Tres Bien Matches found at Tender Lender. So the matches are from Tres Bien but found in Tigre's office. This could imply that someone from Tigre's office was there, but not necessarily Tigre himself. So not a direct contradiction.

Evidence 20: Glen's calendar note "Meet with The Tiger" on Dec 3.

Testimony 0: Tigre says he never met Glen.

If the meeting happened, then Tigre is lying. But according to Tigre's testimony 2 and 3, he set up the meeting at Tender Lender but Glen didn't show. So they didn't meet. Therefore, Testimony 0 is technically true. So no contradiction here.

Wait, but maybe the meeting did happen elsewhere. For example, if the meeting was at Tres Bien, and Tigre was there, contradicting his Testimony 4. But how to know? The calendar note doesn't specify location. The only location mentioned is in Tigre's Testimony 2, where he says the meeting was at his office.

Alternatively, Evidence 3: the sports paper with 'MC Bomber' doodle. The 'MC Bomber' is a virus at Tender Lender (Evidence 23). The doodle has '100,000' crossed out and 'ahahaha'. Maybe indicating someone was extorting 100k, but it's crossed out. If Tigre is involved in this, but he denies knowing Glen (Testimony 0), but the MC Bomber is connected to Glen's work as a programmer, maybe. But not sure.

Wait, Evidence 23 says MC Bomber is a computer virus found at Tender Lender. If Glen was a programmer, maybe he created it, and the meeting with The Tiger was about that. So Tigre's denial of knowing Glen would be a lie. But if the meeting was arranged but not attended, then Tigre's statement that he never met Glen is true. So again, no contradiction.

Wait, what about Evidence 26: Paper Badge found at Tender Lender. It's a fake attorney badge. The phony who framed Maggey used a fake badge, implying Tigre's involvement in creating the fake badge. But how does that contradict his testimonies? Unless he testifies about not knowing about the fake badge, but there's no such testimony here.

Alternatively, looking at Testimony 1: Tigre mentions that Glen wanted to borrow cash. Evidence 21: Glen's losing horse racing tickets (over 500) suggest he had gambling debts. So maybe he needed money, which aligns with Tigre's Testimony 1. No contradiction there.

Wait, another angle: The victim's lottery ticket (Evidence 14) was found on Maggey, but it's a winning ticket for half a million. If Glen had this, maybe he was planning to use it to pay off a loan. Jean's loan (Evidence 8) is also half a million. Maybe there's a connection, but not directly related to Tigre's testimonies.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. The most straightforward contradiction is between Tigre's Testimony 4 ("never been to Tres Bien") and Evidence 24 (Tres Bien matches at his office). Even if he didn't go there, the presence of the matches could imply a connection. But is that a direct contradiction? If he says he's never been there, but his office has items from there, it suggests someone from his office was there, which he could be lying about. But maybe he just has the matches without going himself. It's possible, but in the context of a contradiction in a court setting, this could be the intended pair.

Alternatively, the key contradiction is between Testimony 0 (Tigre never met Glen) and Evidence 20 (Glen had a meeting with The Tiger). Even if the meeting didn't happen, the fact that Glen had it scheduled suggests that he intended to meet Tigre, which Tigre acknowledges in Testimony 2 (he set up the meeting). So Testimony 0 says "never met", which is true if the meeting didn't happen. So no contradiction.

Wait, but Testimony 0 is "I never met Glen Elg." If the meeting was scheduled but not attended, then he's telling the truth. So no contradiction.

Then perhaps the correct pair is Evidence 24 and Testimony 4. Because if Tres Bien matches are found at Tender Lender, and Tigre claims he never went to Tres Bien, but his office has matches from there, it suggests that he or someone from his office was there. But unless there's proof he was there, it's not a direct contradiction. However, in legal terms, the presence of the matches could be used to challenge his testimony. So maybe this is the intended answer.

Alternatively, Evidence 20 and Testimony 0. Even though the meeting might not have happened, the fact that Glen noted the meeting suggests that there was an intent, and Tigre's denial of ever meeting him (if the meeting did happen). But without evidence that the meeting occurred, it's not a contradiction. But perhaps the meeting did happen at Tres Bien. If the victim was at Tres Bien during the time he was supposed to meet Tigre, and Tigre was also there, then Testimony 4 is contradicted. But how to link that?

Wait, the victim was at Tres Bien during his death (between 1:30-2:30 PM). The Millionaire Radio Flyer (Evidence 19) is at 1:30 PM. So maybe the meeting with The Tiger was scheduled during that time. If the meeting was at Tender Lender, but the victim was at Tres Bien, then he didn't go to the meeting. So Tigre's Testimony 3 ("he ain't ever showed") is true. But if the meeting was actually at Tres Bien, then Tigre would have been there, contradicting Testimony 4. But there's no evidence stating the meeting location was Tres Bien. The only evidence about the meeting location is Testimony 2 by Tigre, which says it was at Tender Lender.

So perhaps the contradiction is between Evidence 24 (Tres Bien matches at Tender Lender) and Testimony 4 (Tigre never went to Tres Bien). The matches could suggest that someone from Tender Lender was at Tres Bien, which might be Tigre. But he denies ever going there. This could be the contradiction the question is looking for.

{"evidence": 24, "testimony": 4}
Okay, let's start by looking through the evidence and testimonies to find contradictions. The goal is to find one pair where the evidence directly contradicts a testimony.

First, let's review the testimonies given by Tigre (Testimonies 0-3). Testimony 3 says, "I figured if the place wasn't hot already, it was gonna be, so I split." Then Testimony 4 adds, "I heard the cop's sirens on my way out, and I went straight back to my office." So Tigre claims he left the scene before the police arrived, hearing the sirens as he was leaving.

Now, looking at the evidence, Evidence 7 is a Scooter ridden by the phony, with the wheel guard smashed. Evidence 24 is Tres Bien Matches found at Tender Lender. But wait, Evidence 19 is the Millionaire Radio Flyer, which mentions an event every Monday at 1:30 PM. The incident happened on Dec 3rd, which was a Monday. The time of death was between 1:30 and 2:30 PM (Evidence 10). So the murder occurred around the time of the radio event.

But how does this tie into Tigre's testimony? Let's check Evidence 3: the Sports Paper from Dec 3rd with a doodle about 'MC Bomber' and '100,000' crossed out. Then Evidence 23 is the MC Bomber disc found at Tender Lender, which has a virus. Also, Evidence 20 is Glen's Calendar noting a meeting with "The Tiger" (Furio Tigre) on Dec 3rd. So Tigre was supposed to meet Glen that day.

Wait, in Testimony 0, Tigre says he was supposed to meet "the kid" (probably Glen) at the restaurant. Then in Testimony 1, he claims he opened the door and saw the scene. But according to Evidence 20, Glen had a meeting scheduled with Tigre. However, Tigre's Testimony 4 says he heard the sirens on his way out. But according to Evidence 19, the Millionaire Radio Flyer event is at 1:30 PM. If the murder happened during that time, and the police were called, when would the sirens be heard? If Tigre left before the police arrived, but the murder was at 1:30-2:30 PM, perhaps there's a timing issue.

Alternatively, let's look at Evidence 3: the Sports Paper from Dec 3rd with the doodle. The doodle says 'MC Bomber' pointing to '100,000' crossed out and 'Ahahahaha'. Evidence 23 is the MC Bomber disc found at Tender Lender, which is Tigre's company. The MC Bomber might relate to the virus. But how does this contradict Tigre's testimony?

Wait, Tigre's Testimony 4 says he heard the sirens on his way out. But if the police arrived after he left, how did they get there so quickly? The time of death is between 1:30 and 2:30 PM. If the murder occurred around 1:30, and the police were called, when would Tigre have left? If he left immediately after the murder, the sirens would have been after. But maybe there's a contradiction in the timeline.

Alternatively, looking at Evidence 25: Repair Bill paid by Tigre to Cadaverini for $15,000. Maybe that's linked to something else, but not directly a contradiction.

Wait, another angle: The victim's autopsy (Evidence 10) says death was between 1:30-2:30 PM. The Millionaire Radio Flyer (Evidence 19) is every Monday at 1:30 PM. The crime photo (Evidence 12) shows the victim collapsed, with a coffee cup. The coffee cup (Evidence 13) had cyanide with Maggey's prints. But the key contradiction might be in Tigre's testimony about leaving before the police arrived, but the evidence shows that the police arrived quickly. However, not sure which evidence contradicts this.

Wait, looking at Testimony 3: Tigre says he left because he thought the place would become hot. Then Testimony 4 says he heard the sirens on his way out. But Evidence 4 is Job Listings from Vitamin Square, thrown by the old man. Not sure.

Wait, Evidence 7 is the Scooter with a smashed wheel guard. The phony (impersonator) used it. If the phony was involved in fleeing, maybe Tigre's exit contradicts that. But I'm not seeing a direct link.

Alternatively, look at Evidence 3: the Sports Paper from Dec 3rd, left by a customer. The doodle mentions 'MC Bomber' and 100k crossed out. If the MC Bomber is a virus disc (Evidence 23), perhaps the 100k refers to the loan amount. Jean's Loan Contract (Evidence 8) is half a million, but the victim's lottery ticket (Evidence 14) is half a million. Hmm.

Wait, the victim's lottery ticket (Evidence 14) was found on Maggey, but it's a winning ticket. If the victim had a meeting with Tigre (The Tiger) as per Evidence 20, maybe the meeting was about the lottery ticket. But how does this contradict Tigre's testimony?

Alternatively, consider Testimony 0 where Tigre says he was supposed to meet Glen. But according to Evidence 20, Glen's calendar noted the meeting with The Tiger (Tigre). So that's consistent. Then in Testimony 1, Tigre says he opened the door and saw the scene. If he was there at the time, but the victim was already dead, maybe the timing is conflicting.

Wait, the time of death is 1:30-2:30 PM. The Millionaire Radio Flyer event is at 1:30 PM. If Tigre was there, maybe he was involved in the murder. But how does this contradict his testimony?

Another angle: Evidence 25 is the repair bill paid by Tigre to Cadaverini. If Tigre had to pay them, maybe he needed money, which connects to the loan company. But not directly contradicting testimony.

Wait, let's think about the Sports Paper (Evidence 3) again. The doodle says 'MC Bomber' with 100,000 crossed out. If that refers to the virus disc (Evidence 23) which is a computer virus, maybe the plan was to use it for extortion. But the crossed out 100k might mean the plan changed. But how does this contradict Tigre's testimony?

Alternatively, the doodle's 'Ahahahaha' might suggest someone was mocking. If Tigre was involved in the virus plan, but his testimony says he left upon seeing the body and heard sirens, maybe the Sports Paper's presence in Tres Bien contradicts his whereabouts. But not sure.

Wait, the key contradiction could be between Tigre's Testimony 4 where he says he heard the police sirens on his way out, but Evidence 3 (Sports Paper from Dec 3rd) has a doodle that might indicate prior knowledge. Wait, the Sports Paper is from Dec 3rd, the day of the incident. The doodle's content might suggest that the plan (MC Bomber) was already in motion. If Tigre was involved in the virus plot, his Testimony 3 and 4 about fleeing because the place would be hot might be contradicted by the fact that the virus was part of a plan he was involved in. But this is a bit vague.

Alternatively, let's look at the timeline. The autopsy says death between 1:30 and 2:30. The Millionaire Radio event starts at 1:30. The victim was at Tres Bien for the meeting. If Tigre was there for the meeting, and the murder happened at 1:30, then when did he leave? His testimony says he left upon seeing the body and heard sirens on his way out. But if the body wasn't discovered immediately, how did the police arrive so fast? Unless someone called them right away. But the one who called the police would be someone else, maybe Maggey. However, the police arrival time isn't specified in evidence. 

Wait, looking at Evidence 18: Victor's Testimony says he broke the vase at his seat during the incident. The Crime Photo (12) shows an intact vase on each table. But Victor's testimony says he broke his vase. That's a contradiction between Evidence 12 (photo shows intact vases) and Testimony 18 (Victor says he broke his). But the user's question is to find a contradiction between evidence and testimony. However, in the given testimonies, the user provided testimonies 0-4, all from Tigre. Wait, the Testimonies list includes Testimony 0 to 4 from Tigre, and Testimony 18 is Victor's Testimony: "When the incident occurred, I broke the vase at my seat. I'm sorry." But Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) shows two intact vases. So Evidence 12 contradicts Victor's Testimony 18. But the user is asking for a testimony from the provided list (0-4, which are Tigre's), but Testimony 18 is Victor's. Wait, no. Wait, in the given testimonies, the user lists:

Testimonies:
Testimony 0-4: Tigre
Testimony 18: Victor's (but in the list provided, Testimony 18 is Victor's, but the user included it in the testimonies. Wait, let me check the input again.

Wait, the user provided a list of Testimonies. The Testimonies go from 0 to 4, all by Tigre. Then Testimony 18 is Victor's, but in the given data, after Testimony 4, there's Testimony 18? Let me recheck:

Looking back:

Testimonies provided are Testimony 0 to 4 (Tigre), then Testimony 18 (Victor's). Wait, no. Let me recheck the input.

The user's input under Testimonies:

Testimonies:
Testimony 0
Testimony: I was supposed to meet wid the kid at the restaurant that afternoon.
Person: Tigre
Testimony 1
Testimony: When I opened the door to the joint, I saw one ugly scene.
Person: Tigre
Testimony 2
Testimony: The guy was laid out over the table, stiff as concrete.
Person: Tigre
Testimony 3
Testimony: I figured if the place wasn't hot already, it was gonna be, so I split.
Person: Tigre
Testimony 4
Testimony: I heard the cop's sirens on my way out, and I went straight back to my office.
Person: Tigre

Then additional testimonies are not listed here. Wait, the user's input cuts off after Testimony 4? Wait no, looking at the original input:

Wait, the user's provided data includes:

Testimonies:
Testimony 0
...
Testimony 4
...
Testimony 18
...

Wait, no. The user's input in the problem statement lists Testimonies from 0 to 4 (Tigre's), and then jumps to Testimony 18 (Victor's). But the way the problem is structured, the user might have truncated the list for brevity. However, in the actual problem, the Testimonies provided in the input are up to Testimony 4 (all Tigre) and then others like Testimony 18 (Victor's) are part of the data. But when the user asks to find contradictions between evidence and testimony, they may refer to any of the testimonies listed, not just Tigre's.

But the user's instruction is: "Which evidence and testimony contradict each other? You must only answer one pair."

So, considering all given testimonies, including Victor's Testimony 18, which says he broke the vase, but the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows intact vases. That's a direct contradiction. So Evidence 12 contradicts Testimony 18. But in the given problem, the user might expect to pick from the testimonies listed (0-4 and 18). But according to the user's data, Testimony 18 is Victor's. So if that's allowed, then that's a valid pair.

But the user's instruction says "testimonies" include all provided. However, in the problem setup, the user lists the Testimonies as:

Testimonies:
Testimony 0 to 4 (Tigre)
Then Testimony 18 (Victor's)

So according to that, Testimony 18 is part of the data.

Thus, Evidence 12 (Crime Photo showing intact vases) contradicts Testimony 18 (Victor's claim he broke the vase). But the user might be looking for that. However, the user's sample answer expects us to pick one from the testimonies provided, including all of them.

But the user might also have intended that we focus on Tigre's testimonies. Alternatively, maybe there's another contradiction.

Wait, let's get back to Tigre's testimony. In Testimony 4, he says he heard the sirens on his way out. However, Evidence 19 (Millionaire Radio Flyer) says the event is every Monday at 1:30 PM. The incident happened on Dec 3rd (Monday), and the time of death is 1:30-2:30 PM. If the Millionaire Radio event was ongoing at 1:30 PM, and the murder occurred during that time, then the police would have been called after the murder. But Tigre claims he heard the sirens as he was leaving. If the murder happened around 1:30 PM, and the police arrived quickly, but the radio show's timing might mean that there were many people around, which could affect the timeline. Not sure.

Alternatively, looking at Evidence 3 (Sports Paper from Dec 3rd) which has a doodle about 'MC Bomber' and 100k crossed out. If Tigre was involved in the MC Bomber plan (Evidence 23 is the virus disc), then his testimony about leaving because the place was going to be hot might be contradicted by the fact that he had prior knowledge of the MC Bomber plan. But this is more of a connection than a direct contradiction.

Alternatively, the key contradiction is between Tigre's Testimony 4 (hearing sirens on his way out) and Evidence 19 (Millionaire Radio event at 1:30 PM). If the event's timing caused a lot of noise, maybe the sirens couldn't be heard. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, looking at Evidence 7: Scooter ridden by the phony, wheel guard smashed. If the phony used the scooter to flee, but Tigre claims he went back to his office, maybe there's a contradiction. But not directly.

Wait, perhaps the Repair Bill (Evidence 25) shows Tigre paid $15k to Cadaverini. If Tigre needed money, and the victim had a winning lottery ticket (Evidence 14), maybe Tigre had motive. But not a direct contradiction.

Hmm, maybe the key contradiction is between Tigre's Testimony 3 and 4, where he says he left before the police arrived and heard sirens. But Evidence 14 (Victim's Lottery Ticket) was found on Maggey, which was planted. If Tigre was the real killer, he might have framed Maggey. But how does that contradict his testimony?

Wait, another angle: The Small Bottle (Evidence 6) is the victim's ear medicine, found in the kitchen with unidentified fingerprints. If Tigre handled it, his prints would be there, contradicting his testimony that he left immediately. But we don't know whose prints are on it.

Alternatively, let's go back to Victor's Testimony 18 and Evidence 12. That's a clear contradiction. Victor says he broke the vase, but the photo shows intact vases. So Evidence 12 contradicts Testimony 18. But the user's answer requires a JSON with the evidence and testimony numbers. So Evidence 12 and Testimony 18. But the problem says "the testimonies" provided include Testimony 18. So this would be a valid pair. However, the user might have intended to focus on Tigre's testimonies. Alternatively, maybe there's another pair.

Wait, Tigre's Testimony 4 says he heard the police sirens as he was leaving. But the Sports Paper (Evidence 3) has a doodle from Dec 3rd (the day of the incident) left by a customer. If the doodle refers to the MC Bomber plan, which was already executed, then Tigre's claim to have left upon seeing the body and hearing sirens might conflict with the timing. But this is not a direct contradiction.

Alternatively, Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar) notes a meeting with "The Tiger" (Tigre) on Dec 3rd. Tigre's Testimony 0 says he was supposed to meet the kid (Glen) at the restaurant. So that's consistent, not a contradiction.

Another possible contradiction: Evidence 24 (Tres Bien Matches found at Tender Lender). If Tigre's office (Tender Lender) has matches from Tres Bien, it places him there. But his Testimony 4 says he went straight back to his office after leaving Tres Bien. So the matches could indicate he was there, but that's not a contradiction.

Wait, the Repair Bill (Evidence 25) is paid to the Cadaverini Family. If Tigre owed them money, but his Testimony 3 says he left to avoid heat, maybe he had a motive related to the payment. Not a direct contradiction.

Back to Victor's Testimony 18 and Evidence 12. The Crime Photo (12) shows intact vases, but Victor says he broke his. That's a direct contradiction. So the pair would be Evidence 12 and Testimony 18. But the problem asks to output one pair. However, the user might want us to focus on Tigre's testimonies. If we have to pick from Tigre's testimonies (0-4), perhaps another angle.

Looking at Tigre's Testimony 1: "When I opened the door to the joint, I saw one ugly scene." If he entered after the murder, but Evidence 20 says Glen was meeting with Tigre. So if Tigre arrived at the time of the meeting, he would have been present when the murder occurred, not after. But his testimony says he saw the scene upon opening the door. If the murder happened during the meeting, Tigre might have been present. But this isn't a direct contradiction unless there's evidence about when the meeting was supposed to take place.

Evidence 20: Glen's calendar says "Meet with The Tiger" on Dec 3rd. The time isn't specified. If the meeting was at 1:30 PM (same as the radio show), then Tigre would have been there at the time of the murder. His Testimony 1 says he opened the door and saw the body. But the autopsy says death occurred between 1:30 and 2:30. If the meeting was at 1:30, and the murder happened then, Tigre arriving at the time would make him a suspect. But how does this contradict his testimony?

Alternatively, if the meeting was at 1:30 PM and Tigre arrived then, he would have been there during the murder. But he claims he saw the body upon arrival. If the victim was poisoned, the cyanide would take effect quickly. So if the victim was meeting Tigre, and Tigre arrived, saw the victim already dead, that's possible. Not a contradiction.

Hmm, perhaps the correct pair is Evidence 12 (Crime Photo with intact vases) and Testimony 18 (Victor's claim to have broken a vase). But if the user's answer allows that, then {"evidence": 12, "testimony": 18} is the answer. However, the user's example answer uses evidence 2 and testimony 3, which are lower numbers, implying maybe they expect a different pair.

Alternatively, another contradiction: Testimony 3 by Tigre says he left because the place would be hot. Evidence 24 (Matches from Tres Bien found at Tender Lender). If Tigre took the matches from Tres Bien to Tender Lender, it shows he was there, but his Testimony 3 says he left and went back to his office. Not a direct contradiction, but connects him to the location.

Wait, another angle. The victim's Prescription Bag (Evidence 17) is empty. The Small Bottle (Evidence 6) is the ear medicine, found in the kitchen with fingerprints. If the prescription was supposed to have the medicine, but the bottle is in the kitchen, maybe someone moved it. But how does this contradict testimony?

Alternatively, the victim's Lottery Ticket (Evidence 14) was found on Maggey, implying she stole it. But if Tigre killed the victim for the ticket, he would have taken it. But that's a motive, not a contradiction.

Back to the initial thought: Victor's Testimony 18 vs Evidence 12. This seems like a clear contradiction. The photo shows intact vases, Victor says he broke one. Therefore, the evidence contradicts his testimony. So the answer would be {"evidence": 12, "testimony": 18}.

But I need to check if the user included Testimony 18 in the provided testimonies. Looking back, yes, the user lists Testimony 18 under Testimonies. So it's a valid pair.

{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 18}
Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let me start by going through the testimonies and the evidences to see where there's a conflict.

First, looking at the testimonies from Tigre. Testimony 0 says he loaned Elg 100,000 dollars. Then in testimony 4, he mentions that Glen Elg won half a million dollars with a lottery ticket. Evidence 14 is the victim's lottery ticket for half a million, found on Maggey. Testimony 6 from Tigre says that thanks to what Maggey did (killing Glen), his business with Glen was over. But Tigre also says in testimony 7 that he was after the $100k and had no other reason to kill Glen.

Now, looking at evidence 20, Glen's calendar has a note to meet with "The Tiger" on the day of the incident. "The Tiger" is Furio Tigre's nickname. So Glen was supposed to meet Tigre. But according to Tigre's testimonies, he met Glen and was about to collect the debt when Glen said he couldn't pay but then won the lottery. So Tigre's motive would be to get the 100k, but if Glen had a half million, Tigre might have wanted that instead. However, Tigre claims he didn't have another reason. Wait, but maybe there's a contradiction here. Let me check evidence 23: MC Bomber is a disc from Tender Lender (Tigre's company) with a virus. Evidence 3 is a sports paper with a doodle pointing to 'MC Bomber' and '100,000' crossed out. This might connect to Tigre's plan. The crossed-out 100k could mean that the original plan was 100k, but then the MC Bomber (virus) was used for something else. If Tigre says he only wanted the 100k, but evidence suggests he might be involved with the virus (MC Bomber), maybe that's a contradiction.

Wait, also evidence 20 shows Glen was meeting Tigre. If Tigre's loan was 100k, but Glen had a half million lottery ticket, maybe Tigre wanted more. But in testimony 7, Tigre claims he only wanted the 100k. However, the lottery ticket is half a million. If Tigre knew about the ticket, he might have a motive to kill Glen to take the ticket. But according to testimony 4, Tigre was there when Glen won, and then Maggey killed him. Wait, but evidence 14 says the lottery ticket was found on Maggey. So maybe Tigre didn't get the ticket. However, Tigre's testimony 6 says that thanks to Maggey killing Glen, his business with Glen was over. But if Glen had the lottery ticket, Tigre might have wanted to collect more than 100k. So there's a contradiction if Tigre says he was only after 100k, but there's evidence that he could have wanted the 500k.

But wait, let's check the specific contradictions. The key is to find where a testimony directly contradicts evidence. For example, Tigre's testimony 7 says he had no other reason to kill except the 100k. But if the MC Bomber was part of a plan that involved more money, like the 500k, then maybe the sports paper (evidence 3) shows MC Bomber linked to 100k crossed out, which might imply that the original plan was 100k but then something changed. Or maybe the fact that Glen had the lottery ticket worth 500k, and Tigre knew about it (testimony 4), so he had a motive beyond the 100k. Therefore, Tigre's testimony 7 (saying he only wanted 100k) is contradicted by evidence 20 (Glen's calendar note to meet Tigre) and the lottery ticket (evidence 14). But I need to find the exact pair.

Alternatively, looking at evidence 3: the sports paper from Dec 3rd has 'MC Bomber' with an arrow to '100,000' crossed out, and 'Ahahahaha'. This suggests that the MC Bomber was related to 100k, but that amount was crossed out. Maybe the plan changed. If Tigre in testimony 7 says he was after 100k and no other reason, but evidence 3 shows the 100k was crossed out, implying that the target was no longer 100k. So that could be a contradiction.

But how does that connect to Tigre's testimonies? Let's check Tigre's testimony 4 where he says Glen won the 500k. So if Tigre knew Glen had 500k, maybe he wanted that. But testimony 7 claims he was only after 100k. So the evidence of the lottery ticket (evidence 14) and the calendar note (evidence 20) that Glen was meeting Tigre might suggest Tigre had a reason to kill Glen for the 500k, contradicting his testimony 7.

Wait, but the problem says to pick one pair. Let's see:

Testimony 7: "I was after the $100,000. I didn't have no other reason to kill the guy!"

If there's evidence that Tigre had another reason, like the 500k, then that's a contradiction. Evidence 14 is the lottery ticket for 500k, but how does Tigre know about it? Testimony 4 says Tigre was there when Glen won, so Tigre knew about the 500k. Therefore, Tigre had a motive to take the 500k, contradicting his statement that he only wanted the 100k. So evidence 14 (lottery ticket) and testimony 7.

But wait, the lottery ticket was found on Maggey. So maybe Tigre didn't get it. But why would Tigre kill Glen if Glen had the ticket? Unless Tigre wanted the ticket. But Maggey ended up with it. Alternatively, maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.

Another angle: Evidence 20 is Glen's calendar note to meet "The Tiger" (Tigre) on the day. So Tigre was supposed to meet him. But in Tigre's testimonies, he says he met Glen to collect the debt. If the calendar note is about that meeting, then that's consistent. So maybe not a contradiction there.

Looking at evidence 3: the sports paper with 'MC Bomber' and 100k crossed out. The MC Bomber is a virus (evidence 23). If Tigre's plan involved the virus, but he claims he only wanted 100k, maybe there's a link. However, testimony 7 is about his motive for killing Glen. If the virus was part of a larger plan, then maybe Tigre had another reason. But I'm not sure how that directly contradicts testimony 7.

Alternatively, testimony 7 says he had no other reason, but evidence 8 is Jean's loan contract with Tender Lender (Tigre's company) for half a million. Wait, but that's Jean's loan. Maybe Tigre's business is loaning money. The victim, Glen, owed 100k. But if Tigre also had other loans (like Jean's 500k), but that's Jean's, not Glen's. So maybe not directly related.

Wait, let's go back. The main contradiction I can see is that Tigre claims he only wanted the 100k (testimony 7), but the victim had a lottery ticket for 500k, which Tigre knew about (testimony 4). So Tigre had a motive to kill Glen to take the 500k, contradicting his claim that he only wanted 100k. Therefore, evidence 14 (lottery ticket) contradicts testimony 7 (Tigre's claim of no other motive). But how does that directly contradict? Because if Tigre knew about the 500k, he had a reason to kill for that, which is a different motive. So the testimony 7 says he had no other reason, but the evidence 14 shows there was another potential reason. So that's the contradiction. Therefore, the answer would be {"evidence": 14, "testimony": 7}.

Wait, but let me check the other possibilities. Evidence 3 (sports paper) has the crossed-out 100k. If that implies the plan changed from 100k to something else (like 500k), then testimony 7 (saying only 100k) would be contradicted by evidence 3. But evidence 3's description says the doodle was left by a customer on Dec 3rd. Who left it? Maybe Glen or someone else. If it's related to Tigre's plan, then the crossed-out 100k could mean he was after more, hence contradicting testimony 7. But the link between the sports paper and Tigre isn't explicit. The MC Bomber disc (evidence 23) is from Tigre's Tender Lender, so maybe Tigre was involved with the virus. If the virus was part of a plan to get money, maybe more than 100k. But how does that tie into testimony 7?

Alternatively, the sports paper (evidence 3) shows that the 100k was crossed out, implying that the target was higher. If Tigre's testimony 7 says he was only after 100k, but the evidence shows that the plan was to go for more, that's a contradiction. But the sports paper's connection to Tigre isn't clear. Unless the MC Bomber is a reference to the virus, which is connected to Tigre via evidence 23. So the sports paper (evidence 3) and testimony 7 might be the contradiction. Because the doodle on the sports paper (evidence 3) has 'MC Bomber' linked to 100k crossed out, suggesting that the original 100k was no longer the target, maybe aiming for more. If Tigre says he was only after 100k (testimony 7), but the crossed-out amount suggests otherwise, then that's a contradiction. So evidence 3 contradicts testimony 7.

Hmm, I'm torn between evidence 14 and 3. Let me check the testimonies again. Tigre's testimony 4: he says Glen won 500k. So Tigre knew about the lottery. If Glen had the 500k ticket, then Tigre might have a motive to take it. But Tigre says in testimony 7 that he didn't have another reason. So if he knew about the 500k, that's another motive. Therefore, evidence 14 (the ticket) contradicts Tigre's testimony 7. So the pair would be evidence 14 and testimony 7.

Alternatively, the sports paper (evidence 3) with the crossed-out 100k and MC Bomber might be part of a plan to use the virus (MC Bomber) to get more money. Since MC Bomber is a virus from Tender Lender (Tigre's company), this implies Tigre was involved in a scheme beyond the 100k loan. Thus, testimony 7 (only after 100k) is contradicted by evidence 3. But how solid is that connection? The sports paper's doodle isn't explicitly linked to Tigre. It was left by a customer. Maybe Glen doodled it, but that's not certain. On the other hand, the MC Bomber disc (evidence 23) is found at Tender Lender, which is Tigre's place, so he's connected. So the sports paper's MC Bomber and crossed-out 100k could indicate that the original 100k plan was abandoned for something else, which would mean Tigre had another motive. Therefore, testimony 7 (no other reason) is contradicted by evidence 3 (crossed-out 100k and MC Bomber). So the pair would be evidence 3 and testimony 7.

Alternatively, let's think about Tigre's loan to Glen (testimonies 0-7). He loaned 100k, and when Glen couldn't pay, he won 500k. Tigre says that thanks to Maggey killing Glen, his business was over (testimony 6). But if Glen had the 500k ticket, why would Tigre's business be over? Because maybe he could take the ticket. But the ticket was found on Maggey, implying she took it. So Tigre didn't get the ticket. So perhaps his only way to get money was the 100k. But if Glen had the ticket, maybe he could have used it to pay back more. But Tigre's testimony 4 says that Glen started screaming about winning, implying that he intended to use the 500k to pay back the 100k. So Tigre would get his 100k, and the rest would be Glen's. But then why would Tigre kill him? Unless he wanted the entire 500k. But if he did, then testimony 7 is a lie. So the existence of the 500k ticket (evidence 14) contradicts testimony 7, where he says no other reason.

Therefore, the contradiction is between evidence 14 (lottery ticket) and testimony 7 (Tigre's claim of no other motive). So the answer should be {"evidence": 14, "testimony": 7}.

{"evidence": 14, "testimony": 7}

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 5 by Gumshoe states, "The defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!" This implies that the purchase was premeditated with the intent to commit murder. However, Evidence 15 states, "Bears the victim's blood and Engarde's fingerprints. In the grip, 'Gatewater' is engraved." This suggests that the knife came from the Gatewater Hotel, indicating it may have been taken from the hotel on the spur of the moment, rather than bought beforehand for the purpose of murder.

This creates a contradiction between the evidence suggesting the knife was not specifically bought for the crime and the testimony asserting it was premeditated.

******************************
To find the contradiction, we must compare the evidence and testimonies to identify inconsistencies.

First, let's consider Oldbag's testimony:

- Testimony 4: Oldbag states that "It was Engarde. Matt Engarde. He was trying to sneak his way out of Juan's room!"
- Testimony 5: She specifies that he was "wearing his flashy racing jacket."

Now, let's look at relevant pieces of evidence:

- Evidence 17: Lotta's Photo depicts a person in samurai garb standing outside the door right after the murder, which conflicts with Oldbag's statement of seeing Matt Engarde sneaking out in a racing jacket.
- Evidence 9 (Crime Photo): Corrida, the victim, was dressed in a samurai outfit at the murder scene, indicating the samurai garb is a key element in the events of the murder.

The contradiction lies in the mismatch between Oldbag's testimony of seeing Engarde in his "flashy racing jacket" and the photographic evidence of someone dressed as the Nickel Samurai leaving the scene. This suggests that Engarde was not in the attire Oldbag claims to have seen, questioning her account's accuracy.

Therefore, the contradiction is between Oldbag's testimony that claims to have seen Matt Engarde sneaking out in a racing jacket and the evidence showing someone in a samurai outfit.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. 

Testimony 4 states: "So he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan." This implies that the Nickel Samurai costume was worn by the murderer when Juan Corrida was stabbed.

However, Evidence 14, which is "Juan's Autopsy Report," indicates that Juan Corrida was "strangled to death with a scarf, then stabbed with a knife." This suggests that the stabbing was not the only cause of death and was not necessarily the first act of violence, which contradicts Oldbag's assumption that the murder was solely committed during the stabbing while wearing the costume.

Thus, it appears that the testimony regarding the costume being worn while stabbing Juan conflicts with the autopsy report's details of the murder.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 5 by Andrews mentions, "I was the one who knocked the flower vase over, where it fell onto the guitar case." This implies the vase was knocked over and water spilled onto the guitar case, which would explain water being "only on top of the lid."

However, Evidence 9, the "Crime Photo," shows "the remains of a smashed vase that has stained the carpet with water" but does not support the idea that the water was specifically on top of the guitar case lid, as stated in Testimony 5. Instead, Evidence 7, the "Guitar Case," aligns with the testimony. Thus, these do not directly contradict each other.

Reviewing again, let's focus on Testimony 3. Andrews claims, "What I saw was, naturally, the exact same scene as in the crime scene photo." This implies that she should not have disturbed the scene before others arrived, which includes not pouring juice, as mentioned in Testimony 4.

However, Evidence 8, the "Wine Glass", was "filled with tomato juice" and had "Andrews' fingerprints," indicating she interacted with the glass before the crime scene photo could have been taken. This implies an inconsistency between the testimony of not having disturbed the scene (Testimony 3) and the evidence of having left fingerprints.

Thus, the contradiction is due to her claiming not to have altered the scene, despite evidence of her interaction with the wine glass.

{"evidence": 8, "testimony": 3}
******************************
Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. 

Testimony 1 states, "I suppose I must have opened the guitar case... after I knocked the vase over." According to Andrews' testimony, the sequence suggests the vase was knocked over before the guitar case was opened. However, Evidence 9, which is the "Crime Photo," shows that the guitar case lid has water only on top of it while the vase is broken and the carpet is stained. This implies that the vase was broken after the guitar case was placed on top, contradicting testimony regarding the sequence of events. Therefore, there is a contradiction between the testimony and the crime scene evidence.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 5 states, "That button was torn off of Juan during his fight with Matt."

Evidence 14, Juan's Autopsy Report, states the cause of death: "Strangled to death with a scarf, then stabbed with a knife." This suggests that Juan was not in a position to fight and have a button torn off during the time of his murder, as he was first incapacitated and then killed swiftly.

Evidence 16, Jammin' Ninja's Button, states the button "was ripped from his costume. Is covered in Corrida's blood. Found in Engarde's 'hakama'." This suggests the button could have been moved after the fact, or a false narrative is being created, as the autopsy indicates that an opportunity for a struggle wasn't probable.

Therefore, there's a contradiction between Testimony 5 and the details of Juan's death as per Evidence 14.

**Contradiction:**
- **Evidence 14**: Juan was strangled and then stabbed, suggesting no fight occurred.
- **Testimony 5**: Claims a button was torn off in a fight with Matt.

This is the pair where the evidence and testimony contradict each other.

******************************
Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 5 states, "When I realized that he was dead... That's when I knocked the flower vase over." However, Evidence 9, which is "Crime Photo," mentions "Next to the guitar case are the remains of a smashed vase that has stained the carpet with water," implying the vase was knocked over during the murder or prior to the realization of death, contradicting Andrews' statement that she knocked it over after realizing the victim was dead.

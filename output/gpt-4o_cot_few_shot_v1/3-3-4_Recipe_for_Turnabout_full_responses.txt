Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

- Testimony 3 states, "After la terrible incident occurred, I move la mirror so it was not in z'e way." and Testimony 4 states, "But naturally, I did not touch anything else!" This suggests that Jean Armstrong claims to have only moved the mirror and not altered any other part of the crime scene.

- Evidence 18, "Victor's Testimony", states, "When the incident occurred, I broke the vase at my seat. I'm sorry." This implies that something else at the crime scene was altered: the vase being broken.

- Evidence 12 mentions, "A photo of the scene taken from near the kitchen" where "There is an intact vase on each table."

There is a contradiction between Armstrong's testimony of not touching anything else, which implies nothing else being out of place after the incident, and the evidence showing that the vase at Victor Kudo's seat should have been broken after the incident. Since it's intact in the crime photo, the crime scene was likely altered further, contradicting Armstrong's claim.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

First, we look at Testimony 5, which states, "It was approximately 5 minutes later z'at la poisoning incident occurred." This testimony suggests that the poisoning happened very shortly after Glen Elg learned about his lottery win.

Now, consider Evidence 19: "Millionaire Radio Flyer - Experience the most thrilling ten minutes of your life every Monday at 1:30 PM!" This evidence implies that the announcement or event related to the lottery win likely took place at 1:30 PM. 

Glen Elg's time of death, according to Evidence 10: "Glen’s Autopsy Report," was between 1:30 and 2:30 PM, leaving a window for when the poisoning could have happened. However, Armstrong's Testimony 2 places Glen at the restaurant just after 2 PM. This contradicts the timeline implication that the lottery announcement, and consequently Glen becoming aware of his win, and his subsequent reaction, occurred after 2 PM. It doesn't align with Armstrong's sequence of events.

Taking into account the evidence, the contradiction lies in the timing of the incident relative to the lottery announcement and Glen's arrival at the restaurant.

Therefore, the pair that directly contradicts each other is:

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 2 from Tigre states, "The day youse talkin' about, I was in de office, too. I never saw that kid before." However, Evidence 20, titled "Glen's Calendar," contains a note on December 3rd, the day of the incident, saying, "Meet with The Tiger." This suggests that Furio Tigre did meet Glen Elg on the day of the incident, which contradicts his claim that he never saw Glen Elg before.

{"evidence": 20, "testimony": 2}
******************************
Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

We have several key pieces of information:

- **Testimony 2** from Tigre states: *"I set up a meetin' with the guy... at my office, Tender Lender"*, and **Testimony 4** claims, *"I ain't never been to that Tres Bien joint, youse hear?"*
  
- **Evidence 20: Glen's Calendar** notes that on December 3rd, the day of the incident, there is an entry saying, *"Meet with The Tiger."*

This suggests that Tigre was indeed supposed to meet Glen Elg on the day of the incident.

- **Evidence 3: Sports Paper** mentions, *"dates from December 3rd, the day of the incident"*, and **Evidence 12: Crime Photo** shows the scene at Tres Bien where Glen Elg collapsed.

- **Testimony 4** directly contradicts the evidence linking Tigre to Tres Bien. **Evidence 24: Tres Bien Matches**, found at Tender Lender, suggest Tigre's connection to Tres Bien despite his claim.

Now, let's provide the answer that identifies a contradiction:

- **Testimony 4** claims Tigre has "never been to that Tres Bien joint" but **Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar)** and **Evidence 24 (Tres Bien Matches)** indicate otherwise, showing a connection between Tigre and Tres Bien, contradicting his testimony.

Therefore, the contradiction is between Tigre's testimony claiming he has never been to Tres Bien and the calendar and evidence linking him to meetings with Glen Elg at Tres Bien.

{"evidence": 24, "testimony": 4}
******************************
Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 0 by Furio Tigre states, "I was supposed to meet wid the kid at the restaurant that afternoon." This suggests that Tigre was supposed to meet Glen Elg at the restaurant. 

Looking at the evidences, Evidence 20, "Glen's Calendar," has an entry for December 3rd, the day of the incident, saying, "Meet with The Tiger". 

There is no direct contradiction here since both the evidence and testimony support that there was an intended meeting between Tigre and Glen Elg. 

Let's examine more testimonies:

Testimony 2 states, "The guy was laid out over the table, stiff as concrete." This suggests Tigre saw Glen Elg dead when he arrived at the restaurant.

Evidence 10, the "Glen's Autopsy Report," indicates Glen died of potassium cyanide poisoning between 1:30 and 2:30 PM. This could fit with Tigre's statement as long as he arrived after Glen's demise.

However, the significant issue lies with the timeline and the scene he describes. If we consider Testimony 4, "I heard the cop's sirens on my way out, and I went straight back to my office," it indicates swift action post the incident.

Now, let's address a potential contradiction with Evidence 18, "Victor's Testimony," which states, "When the incident occurred, I broke the vase at my seat. I'm sorry." This suggests Victor Kudo was present during the incident when a vase was broken, which conflicts with the Crime Photo (Evidence 12). 

In Crime Photo, a vase is intact on the table where the victim collapsed, suggesting the incident concluded before anything broke. This indicates Tigre's timing and description in his testimony may not align correctly with what should have been the state of the crime scene during his alleged visit. Thus, his claim and the evidence conflict regarding the sequence of events and what was witnessed. 

Therefore, the contradiction lies between Testimony 3 "I figured if the place wasn't hot already, it was gonna be, so I split," suggesting a reaction to the scene, not aligning with the evidence at hand when considering description and chronology.

To summarize the contradiction:
- Tigre claims he saw the scene in specific chaotic conditions with his responses directly following.
- Evidence indicates the timeline and state of affairs contradict Tigre's account, suggesting possible fabrication or ignorance of details a true visitor would know.

Let's clarify the specific contradicting pair: 

{"evidence": 18, "testimony": 2}
******************************
Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 4 from Tigre states that Glen Elg won half a million bucks. However, Evidence 14, which is the Victim's Lottery Ticket, confirms that Glen did win a large sum of money. Furthermore, on Glen’s calendar (Evidence 20), there's a note saying, "Meet with The Tiger," suggesting they planned to meet. 

Testimony 7 indicates that Furio Tigre had no other reason to kill Glen besides the $100,000 debt. However, Glen's Autopsy Report in Evidence 10 shows he died of potassium cyanide poisoning, a plan that seems premeditated beyond just a debt collection effort. Additionally, Glen had something of significant financial value on him: a winning lottery ticket worth $500,000 (Evidence 14), which could be another motive for Tigre's actions beyond recovering a $100,000 debt. 

Despite these conflicting points, the primary contradiction is between Testimony 4 and Evidence 14, because Testimony 4 suggests Glen's win should negate his debt, yet the $500,000 ticket was found on Maggey, suggesting Tigre's motive wasn't solely debt repayment.

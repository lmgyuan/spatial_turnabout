Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 5 states, "A moment later, there was a single gunshot, then a scream." However, Evidence 18, which is the "DL-6 Case File," states that the murder weapon was fired twice. This contradicts Edgeworth's testimony that there was only a single gunshot heard.

{"evidence": 18, "testimony": 5}

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

We know from Evidence 11, "Russell's Autopsy Report," that the cause of death was "Blunt force trauma to the back of the head." This suggests that something must have hit the Ringmaster from above.

Now let's consider Testimony 2, which states, "However, lifting the bust and looking out of the window would've been impossible." In the testimonies, Acro is suggesting that he couldn't have been involved with lifting and dropping the bust.

However, from the map and description, Acro lives on the third floor of the lodging house, directly above where the murder took place. Given that an acrobat, as Acro himself testifies, has a strong upper body, it's conceivable that he could have lifted the bust with one hand and pushed it out the window without necessarily looking out.

The bust (Evidence 15), described as heavy and likely to be the murder weapon due to its weight and nature, could easily cause blunt force trauma if dropped on someone's head, such as was described in the autopsy.

Combining the possibility of Acro lying about his ability to handle the bust and the type of injury described by the autopsy, these two suggest that he is downplaying his ability to commit the act.

Therefore, the evidence and testimony that contradict each other are:

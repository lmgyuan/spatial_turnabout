Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 0 states, "I saw it clear as day. The man on the boat was Mr. Edgeworth!" This testimony implies that Lotta Hart clearly identified Miles Edgeworth as the person on the boat at the time of the incident.

However, we need to consider the conditions under which this observation was made. Evidence 4, the "Lake Photo," was taken automatically on 12/25 at 12:15 AM. If we click here for the details, in the context it’s known that the photo is very unclear and was taken at night, making it extremely difficult for anyone to confidently identify individuals simply based on sight without clear additional evidence.

The photo’s quality contradicts Lotta's testimony since it’s unlikely she could identify someone clearly at such a distance and under such conditions.

Therefore, the evidence and testimony that contradict each other are:

{"evidence": 4, "testimony": 0}

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

First, let's review the relevant evidence and testimonies:

- **Evidence 2 (Lotta's Camera):** It's set to automatically take a picture when a loud noise is detected and is facing the lake.
- **Testimony 3 (Lotta):** "The camera was set up to take pictures of a meteor shower."

There's a contradiction here. The camera is actually set to take pictures when it hears a loud noise (as described in Evidence 2), but Lotta's testimony claims that the purpose was to capture pictures of a meteor shower, which wouldn't correlate because the act of photographing shooting stars wouldn't typically involve capturing loud noises. This discrepancy suggests that either Lotta misunderstood how her equipment worked or deliberately gave an inaccurate statement to mislead regarding the events surrounding the murder.

Let's finalize this discrepancy in JSON format:

```json
{"evidence": 2, "testimony": 3}
```
******************************
Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

1. Evidence 10, the "Pistol," states that it is the murder weapon and was fired 3 times, and bears prints from Edgeworth's right hand.
2. Testimony 7 from Lotta states, "Then I saw a flash, near one of the men's hands, and I heard another gunshot."

However, Evidence 11, "Lotta's Deposition," mentions that she heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25. This is inconsistent with the fact that the murder weapon was fired three times.

Therefore, there is a contradiction between Lotta's testimony, which implies she only heard two shots, and the evidence indicating that the murder weapon was fired three times.

{"evidence": 10, "testimony": 7}

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 5 from Gumshoe states, "And that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene." This implies that no items were taken from the crime scene.

However, Evidence 14, "Victim's Lottery Ticket," states that a winning ticket for half a million dollars was found during a body search of Maggey. This suggests something was indeed taken from Glen Elg and contradicts Gumshoe's statement that nothing was missing.

The contradiction lies in the fact that the lottery ticket was missing from Glen Elg and later found on Maggey, whereas Gumshoe testified that there was nothing missing from the crime scene.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 2 from Kudo states, "There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there," referring to the serving girl allegedly putting white powder in the victim's javaccino. This suggests that the powder was added at the time Kudo observed the scene.

However, Evidence 16, which is "Potassium Cyanide," states the poison "bears Maggey's fingerprints" and was "found in her apron pocket." It implies that the poison must have already been on the serving girl or added beforehand, contradicting Kudo's claim that he witnessed the white powder being added at the time.

Additionally, Evidence 12, the "Crime Photo", shows that no one was sitting across from the victim, suggesting that it may not have been possible for Kudo to see the powder being added as he described.

Given the inconsistency between the timing and visibility related to the alleged act of poisoning, Testimony 2 contradicts the evidence related to how the poison was allegedly placed.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided:

- Testimony 2 states, "The young man was listening to the wireless." This implies that Glen Elg was listening to the radio during the incident.

- Evidence 10, "Glen's Autopsy Report," indicates Glen died from potassium cyanide poisoning between 1:30 and 2:30 PM.

- Evidence 19, "Millionaire Radio Flyer," notes, "experience the most thrilling ten minutes of your life every Monday at 1:30 PM!" suggesting Glen would have been preoccupied during that time.

These points suggest Glen was indeed listening to the radio at 1:30 PM, which aligns with Testimony 2.

However, when we look at Evidence 12, "Crime Photo," there are no signs of any radio or listening devices at the scene. The photo shows two dining tables, separated by a folding screen, with vases, coffee cups, and papers, but no radio or such device present.

This contradicts Kudo's statement that Glen was "listening to the wireless," which implies there should have been some device for listening present.

The contradiction lies between Testimony 2, which states Glen was listening to something, and the physical evidence represented in Evidence 12 (the Crime Photo), where no such device is visible.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

1. Testimony 2 says, "Well, the clumsy idiot upset the vase. He knocked it right over."
2. Testimony 3 adds, "It broke, and the strip of cloth covering the table got completely soaked!"

These testimonies suggest that the vase was knocked over and the tablecloth became soaked as a result.

However, Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) states: "A photo of the scene taken from near the kitchen. Two dining tables are separated by a folding screen. The one closer to the camera is empty. The other one is where the victim collapsed on the table. There is an intact vase on each table. A coffee cup is knocked over and the tablecloth is stained by coffee. Near the coffee table are some pieces of papers. No one is sitting across from the victim."

In this description, it is clear that the vase on the table where the victim collapsed is still intact. This directly contradicts the testimony that claims the vase was knocked over and broken.

Thus, Testimony 2 and Evidence 12 contradict each other.

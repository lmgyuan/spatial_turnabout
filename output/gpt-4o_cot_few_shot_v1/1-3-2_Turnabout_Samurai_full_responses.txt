Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

Testimony 6 states, "Interesting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM." Testimony 7 states, "It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!"

However, Evidence 11, "Mr. Monkey's Head," states that it "blocked the path to the scene of the crime between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM." If the man walked by at 2:00 PM and headed towards the studio, he would have been blocked by Mr. Monkey's Head after 2:15 PM, making it impossible for Powers to actually reach the studio where the murder happened at 2:30 PM, unless he was already there before it was blocked. 

Furthermore, Evidence 5, "Powers'(?) Photo," taken at 2:00 PM, captures the Steel Samurai, dragging one leg, but this does not confirm that it was Powers himself, since Powers was allegedly asleep due to the sleeping pills found in Evidence 16, "Steak Plate." Hence, there is a contradiction here between the testimony and the evidence regarding who was actually seen and cleared from the blockage.

******************************
Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.

- Testimony 2 states, "No one else went there!" which implies that Oldbag didn't see anyone else go to the studio before 2:30 PM besides Will Powers.

- However, Evidence 11, "Mr. Monkey's Head," states that it "Blocked the path to the scene of the crime between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM", indicating that no one could access that path during that time frame.

This contradiction means that even if someone went unnoticed by Oldbag, the blocked path would prevent anyone from reaching the scene at that time.

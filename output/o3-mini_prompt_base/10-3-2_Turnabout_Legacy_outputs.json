You must only answer one pair. You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}.

    "cot": "Evidence 14 tells us that in the semifinals, Frost's and Gusto’s entries had different designs but tasted exactly the same. However, in Testimony 0 Gusto claims he “handled the flavor” of his own entry while Frost was in charge of the design. If Gusto had sole control over the flavor, one would expect his entry’s taste to differ from Frost’s entry—which he did not. This creates a clear contradiction between the evidence and Testimony 0.\n",

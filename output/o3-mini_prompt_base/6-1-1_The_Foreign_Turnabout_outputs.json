    "cot": "Andistan'dhin, the eyewitness whose testimony is featured (for example, when he insists \"Ahlbi was the only one. Ahlbi was the only one.\"), is in a unique position: his own chamber overlooks the treasure room, and he is the only person with the Magatama Key (Evidence 7), which is required to open the treasure box. His testimony claims that only Ahlbi went to the treasure room, yet if the theft from the treasure box was to occur, someone would have had to use the keyâ€”and that key is in Andistan'dhin's own possession, not with Ahlbi. This presents a direct contradiction between the account implying Ahlbi had sole access and the fact that the key needed to open the box was securely held by Andistan'dhin. \n",

    "cot": "Testimony 4 by Andrews states that she went to pour Juan Corrida some juice because she thought he had fainted. Yet, Evidence 8 (the Wine Glass) turns up at the crime scene completely full of tomato juice with no signs of being partially used or drunk. If she had indeed poured juice for him, one would expect the glass to show signs of use, perhaps partially emptied or disturbed. This discrepancy between her claim of pouring juice and the undisturbed, full glass of tomato juice creates a clear contradiction.\n",

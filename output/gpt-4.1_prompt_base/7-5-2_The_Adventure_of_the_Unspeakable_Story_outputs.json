    "cot": "Let's analyze the testimonies and evidence for contradictions:\n\nTestimony 3 (Nash): \"The bloke wot owned the place was 'oldin' a gun, so 'e should 'ave just fired instead of yellin' at the girl!\"\n\nLooking at the evidence about the crime:\n- Evidence 9 (Autopsy Report): \"A report prepared by the Scotland Yard coroner that confirms instant death due to a single bullet wound from the back. There are no other signs of trauma.\"\n- Evidence 10 (Crime Scene Photograph): Shows the bullet wound in the victim's back.\n- Evidence 12 (Windibank's Gun): \"A gun belonging to the victim, Mr Windibank, that Gina was holding when she was found unconscious. There are signs of a single discharge.\"\n\nNow, in Testimony 3, Nash claims that Windibank was holding the gun and should have fired instead of yelling. However, the evidence (Photograph of Gina, etc.) makes it clear that Gina was holding the gun when discovered. Also, Windibank was shot in the back, suggesting he wasn't holding the gun, or at least wasn't in a position to use it.\n\nA stronger contradiction is present between:\n\nEvidence 13 (Skulkin Brothers' Gun): \"A firearm found in the possession of the Skulkin brothers upon their arrest. There are signs that a single round was fired.\" \nTestimony 6 (Nash): \"We couldn't 'ave shot the pawnbroker, see! We never even 'ad a chance, did we?\"\n\nThis is a direct contradiction: The Skulkin brothers' gun was discharged, yet Nash claims they \"never even had a chance\" to shoot.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n",

This proves the black coat was pawned long before the murder and ties its provenance to an earlier case, implying Gina could not have been wearing it during the shooting (since she acquired it from the pawnbroker much later).\n\nTherefore, Graydon's testimony that the \"accused, in a black coat, shot the man\" is contradicted by Evidence 4, which shows the coat was not in Gina's possession at the time of the shooting and that it was directly related to a prior incident.\n",

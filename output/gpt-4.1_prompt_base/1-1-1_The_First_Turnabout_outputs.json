    "cot": "Testimony 1 claims: \"There was a table clock in the apartment, wasn't there!\"\n\nThe implication is that the statue (Evidence 2) was a clock, which allowed Sahwit to \"see\" the time. However, there is no indication in the evidence that the statue is a clockâ€”it's only described as \"A statue in the shape of 'The Thinker'. It's rather heavy.\" There is nothing stating it is a clock, and if Sahwit only saw the statue, he couldn't know it was a clock unless he had handled it personally.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Testimony 1 and Evidence 2.\n",

    "cot": "Testimony 1 (\"There was a voice saying the time... It was probably coming from the television.\") from Sahwit is contradicted by Evidence 4, the Blackout Record, which shows that electricity was out from noon to 6 PM, meaning the TV couldn't have been on to provide the time when the body was found (between 4PM and 5PM according to the autopsy report). Thus, Sahwit's claim about hearing the time from the television cannot be true.\n",

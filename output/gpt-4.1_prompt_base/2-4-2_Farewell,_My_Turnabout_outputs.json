    "cot": "Testimony 3 states: \"He had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know.\"\nEvidence 2 is a photo that describes the Nickel Samurai costume, which would show what the real costume looks like.\n\nHowever, the contradiction really lies between Testimony 1 (\"The Nickel Samurai, that's right, it was the Nickel Samurai that I saw!\") and Evidence 17 (\"Picture taken in the Hallway right after the murder. A person in samurai garb stands outside the door.\"). The image shows someone in samurai garb, but this could be a disguise—Oldbag assumes she saw the Nickel Samurai, but the evidence only shows 'someone' in the costume, not necessarily Matt Engarde.\n\nBut zooming in on what is asked: a testimony claims something specific, and evidence must show a contradiction. Oldbag says in Testimony 4: \"So he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan.\" However, in Evidence 16, we see that the Jammin' Ninja's button, covered in Corrida's blood, was found in Engarde's \"hakama\" (part of the costume). This means that the costume was tampered with after the murder, making it less likely that Engarde himself wore the costume when killing Corrida, thus contradicting Oldbag’s assertion.\n\nBut for a direct, clearest contradiction, the pairing which is most classical is:\n\nTestimony 1: \"The Nickel Samurai, that's right, it was the Nickel Samurai that I saw!\"\nEvidence 17: \"Picture taken in the Hallway right after the murder. A person in samurai garb stands outside the door.\"\n\nOldbag claims she saw the Nickel Samurai, but the photo evidence only supports that it was 'a person in samurai garb', not necessarily the real Nickel Samurai.\n",

    "cot": "Let's analyze the testimonies and the evidence:\n\nFrom Andrews' testimonies:\n\n- Testimony 4: \"To be honest, I thought he had just fainted or something. So I went to pour him some juice.\"\n- Testimony 5: \"When I realized that he was dead... That's when I knocked the flower vase over.\"\n\nNow let's look at the evidence relating to the scene:\n\nEvidence 8: Wine Glass  \nDescription: Found next to the victim. It's filled with tomato juice. No sign it's been drank. Bears Andrews' fingerprints.\n\nEvidence 9: Crime Photo  \nDescription: Photo of Juan Corrida's murder scene. [caption] The victim sits on a chair in a samurai outfit. There is a knife sticking out of his chest. A glass of juice sits behind him on the dresser. A full bottle of juice sits on the desk in front of him. An open guitar case lies on the floor next to him. Next to the guitar case are the remains of a smashed vase that has stained the carpet with water.\n\nTestimony 5 says: \"When I realized that he was dead... That's when I knocked the flower vase over.\"\nBut Evidence 9's photo shows that the flower vase was already knocked over and had already stained the carpet with water.\n\nThis means the vase must have been knocked over before Andrews claims she realized the victim was dead, creating a contradiction.\n",

This conflicts with Larry's claim of only one.\n\nThus, the contradiction is between Lotta's Deposition (Evidence 11) and Butz's Testimony 5.\n",

    "cot": "Testimony 3 says Larry Butz was sure he heard a gunshot while listening to the radio late at night. However, Lotta's Camera (Evidence 2) was set to automatically take a picture when a loud noise, such as a gunshot, was detected and captured photos of the lake. Given Butz was playing his radio \"real booming loud\" (Testimony 2), the camera would have detected that as well, but it only took photos at the specific times noted, indicating the gunshots—not the radio—triggered the camera. This means Butz may have mistaken a sound from the radio for a gunshot, contradicting the camera’s reliability in distinguishing loud sounds.\n",

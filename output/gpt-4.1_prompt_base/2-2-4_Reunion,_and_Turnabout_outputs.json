You must only answer one pair. You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}.

    "cot": "Evidence 6 (Newspaper Clipping 2) contradicts Testimony 5. The testimony claims Ini was in the passenger seat during the accident, implying her sister was driving. The newspaper clipping suggests the investigation believed Mimi was the driver, but it also notes that Ini herself, in her interview, says, \"I was like, really tired and I dropped off to sleep. Then there was this crash, and like, I woke up in a huge sea of flames. I was like, still half-asleep, but I opened the right door and like, got out.\" If Ini had been in the passenger's seat (on the left side in a car from England), the right door would be the driver's side, contradicting the idea that Mimi was driving and Ini was the passenger.\n",

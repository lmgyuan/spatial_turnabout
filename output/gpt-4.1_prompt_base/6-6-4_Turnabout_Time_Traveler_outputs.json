I didn't have the opportunity to murder Gloomsbury.\nPerson: Nichody\n\nWhich evidence and testimony contradict each other? You must only answer one pair. You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "cot": "Testimony 3, given by Nichody, is \"I've never thought of exacting revenge on Master Sorin.\" To check for contradiction, let's look for evidence suggesting Nichody might have had a motive or thought of revenge against Sorin.\n\nEvidence 19, \"Newspaper Article,\" details that Sorin was the one driving during the car accident that led to Selena Sprocket's death. Selena was Sorin's older sister. However, looking at the character list, Nichody is described as the Sprocket family butler with unusual attachment to his pocket watch. Is there a connection between Selena's accident and Nichody? If the butler had a strong emotional reaction to Selena's death or was attached to her, the newspaper article may suggest a possible motive for revenge against Sorin.\n\nHowever, there is not a direct mention of revenge or desire for revenge in the evidence itself. Let's check the other pieces of evidence.\n\nEvidence 7, \"Gloomsbury's Note,\" was smudged as if written by a right-handed person, but Nichody's dominant hand is not specified here.\n\nTestimony 1, \"Gloomsbury was my right hand man. I'd suffer the most from losing him.\" This is not contradicted.\n\nTestimony 5, \"I was always in the company of others. I didn't have the opportunity to murder Gloomsbury.\" Let's see if any evidence suggests otherwise.\n\nThe Hold Entry Record (Evidence 15) tracks who accessed the hold, but the content detail is not in the evidence description.\n\nNow, let's revisit Evidence 2, \"Ellen's Statement.\" Ellen saw a suspicious third party on the vista deck when she was being attacked by Gloomsbury. If Nichody is implying in his testimonies (such as Testimony 5) that he could not possibly have murdered Gloomsbury because he had no opportunity, Ellen's testimony undercuts this—especially if Nichody is the \"suspicious third party\" seen by Ellen.\n\nTherefore, a contradiction exists between Evidence 2 (\"Ellen's Statement\") and Testimony 5 (\"I was always in the company of others. I didn't have the opportunity to murder Gloomsbury.\")\n",

    "cot": "Evidence 2, Rohl's Autopsy Report, states that the time of death was \"around noon.\" However, Testimony 3 from Andistan'dhin claims he saw \"little Ahlbi with my own eye\" through the window. If the only window view is from Andistan'dhin's chamber and the path to his chamber is past the treasure room, then Andistan'dhin needed to be physically present near the murder scene at the time of the incident, contradicting his claim he only \"saw\" Ahlbi, suggesting he could have been near the victim at the estimated time of death. This casts suspicion on Andistan'dhin's account and contradicts the evidence about the timing.\n",

However, Evidence 7 (Magatama Key) describes that only this special key, kept at all times by Andistan'dhin, can open the box, implying it cannot be forced open. Furthermore, Evidence 4 (and 12) on the Treasure Box says it could not even be opened by the Magatama Key and was forced open, but the testimony says the unclean hands (the accused) forced it open, \"No key did he need,\" despite the implication that only the key could open it. The contradiction here is between the claim that no key was needed to force it open and the evidence that a special key is required.\n",

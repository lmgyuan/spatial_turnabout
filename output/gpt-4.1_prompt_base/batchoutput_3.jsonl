This suggests there was a witness who saw the Professor (or the body) moving after burial.\n\nIf Tusspells' account were true (that she worked only until interment and left immediately after), it would contradict the report of any body rising *after* burial, as she would have seen or reported such an event, or it would have been impossible if the moulding occurred prior to interment. Thus, her claim that she departed immediately after burial and the article describing a post-burial \"resurrection\" can't both be correct.\n\n{\"evidence\": 19, \"testimony\": 6}", "refusal": null, "annotations": []}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2122, "completion_tokens": 232, "total_tokens": 2354, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_c1d5f5ab92"}}, "error": null}

But the autopsy notes both a broken neck from a fall *and* that he was stabbed in the chest with a sharp object. The contradiction might be here: is the cause of death only the fall, or does the fatal blow from the stab wound count as well?\n\nHowever, let's check all others for something more direct.\n\nTestimony 4:\nTestimony: I stood over the victim's corpse where it lay in the toppled cage and plunged the screwdriver into the chest.\nPerson: Sithe\n\nEvidence 7:\nScrewdriver - there is blood at the tip and it matches the wound shape, so this is consistent with the testimony.\n\nTestimony 6:\nThe truth about the execution ten years ago is a state secret...\n\nBut the testimonies center on the immediate crime scene.\n\nTestimony 2:\nThe body had to be 'arranged' in certain ways to implicate the defendant...which was my job.\n\nThis works with the 'arranging' and does not contradict the evidence.\n\nTestimony 3 and Evidence 6 are a close match, but perhaps the more direct contradiction is between:\nEvidence 6 (Autopsy): says both neck broken and stabbed in chest.\nTestimony 3 (Sithe): claims 'the actual cause of death was the neck trauma [...]'.

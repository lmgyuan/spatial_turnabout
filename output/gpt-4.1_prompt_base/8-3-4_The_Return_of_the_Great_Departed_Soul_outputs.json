    "cot": "Let's break down the relevant details to find a contradiction.\n\nTestimony 3 from Tusspells:\n\"I hid myself until he gave me a signal. ...I was there for a very long time that night.\"\n- The context from Testimony 2 is that Tusspells created a mould for the head in the cemetery, *just before the interment* (i.e., before the body was buried).\n\nRelating Evidence:\nEvidence 13 - Piece of Broken Glass: \"A small fragment of very unusual and thick glass that was found in the folds of the clothing of the Professor waxwork. It would appear to be from the Crystal Tower.\" (This is about the waxwork and doesn't relate.)\nEvidence 15 - Waxwork Head: \"The head of the Professor waxwork that was stolen from the Madame Tusspells Special Exhibit.\" (It's the waxwork head, possibly with connections to how the mould was made.)\nEvidence 16 - Killer's Autopsy Report: \"The autopsy report of the mass murderer known as the Professor, who was tried and found guilty by closed trial ten years ago.\"\nEvidence 19 - Ten-Year-Old Article: \"A newspaper article recounting the tale of an eyewitness to the alleged 'resurrection' of the Professor from his grave on the night of his execution.\"\n\nThe contradiction:\nTestimony 3 asserts that Tusspells was present at the grave, waiting to do her work with the head \"before the interment\", i.e., before the burial—so the corpse would not have been buried yet. But the Ten-Year-Old Article (Evidence 19) refers to an eyewitness account of the \"resurrection\" of the Professor from his grave on the night of his execution, i.e., as if the body was seen moving/removed after interment (after burial).\n\nThus, the article contradicts Tusspells's account about when the head was cast. If Tusspells made the mould before burial, the body could not have \"resurrected\" from the grave (as per the news article), as the grave was not yet filled.\n\nTherefore:\n",

You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "cot": "Testimony 3 by Sithe claims: \"The actual cause of death was the neck trauma Asman suffered from the thirty-foot fall.\"\n\nHowever, Evidence 6 (Autopsy Report) states: \"The autopsy report of the victim, Mr Asman. His neck was broken from the impact of a violent fall and he was stabbed in the chest with a sharp object.\"\n\nWhile neck trauma from the fall is given, the autopsy also makes clear that there was a stab wound in the chest with a sharp object, further supported by the photograph (Evidence 5), suggesting the stabbing may also be an important cause of death, and perhaps even the fatal blow. Therefore, the testimony downplays the significance of the stabbing which the autopsy notes as well.\n",

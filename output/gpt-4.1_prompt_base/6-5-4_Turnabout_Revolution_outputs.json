After all, me and my ilk seek a bloodless revolution.\nPerson: Dhurke\nTestimony 6\nTestimony: But I didn't kill him. At least, I don't think I did. It'd go against everything I believe in.\nPerson: Dhurke\nTestimony 7\nTestimony: Though, I guess there's no evidence that proves I didn't kill him either...\nPerson: Dhurke\n\nWhich evidence and testimony contradict each other? You must only answer one pair. You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "cot": "Let's examine Testimony 3: \"And lying right in front of me was Inga, dead as a doornail.\" (Person: Dhurke)\n\nLet's compare that to the evidences. Dr. Buff's Autopsy Report (13) is not related to Inga. What about Inga's Autopsy Report (15)? \n\nEvidence 15 (Inga's Autopsy Report): \"Stabbed from behind. Cause of death is blood loss. Time of death is approximately 3 PM.\"\nTestimony 3 describes Inga's body when Dhurke is present, implying that the body was found as described. \n\nLet’s consider other relevant evidence:\n\nEvidence 20 (Mysterious Bloodstain): \"A bloodstain from Amara's Tomb. This bloodstain had been wiped up by someone. Analysis reveals that it's Dhurke's blood.\"\nTestimony 3 states that Inga was dead as a doornail and presumably everything was as described.\n\nThe contradiction is: If there is Dhurke’s blood wiped up in the tomb (Evidence 20), but Dhurke only saw Inga’s corpse and did not refer to any struggle or being wounded himself, his testimony does not align with the physical evidence of his blood present at the scene.\n\nThus, Dhurke’s testimony implies nothing happened to him, but evidence says his blood was there, wiped up after some incident involving him, which should have been memorable.\n\nSo: \n",

    "cot": "Let's examine Testimony 5: \"I was reunited with my mother, Queen Amara, fifteen years ago when Dhurke abducted her.\" (Person: Nahyuta)\n\nNow, let's look for any evidence that would conflict with this statement.\n\nEvidence 23: Woman's Photo: A photo showing Dhurke and Amara's life on the run about 23 years ago. [caption] Amara is holding a baby, sitting on a chair. Behind her are some books. One of the books has the logo of the Defiant Dragons on its cover.\n\nExplanation: The photo indicates that Dhurke and Amara were together on the run 23 years ago, contradicting Nahyuta's claim in his testimony that he was reunited with his mother only 15 years ago. This suggests the reunion occurred earlier than he states in his testimony.\n",

You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "cot": "Let's examine the testimonies and the evidences for contradictions.\n\nFocus on Kay's testimonies:\n- Testimony 3: \"But... from under the cherry tree... I feel like... I saw something red.\"\n- Testimony 4: \"Umm... That's right, someone was walking towards me from the other side of that stand.\"\n\nNow focus on the evidences, particularly the ones that relate to Kay's memories and the scene on the viewing platform (Bigg Building Pamphlet, recollections, and anything about visuals on the roof).\n\nEvidence 7 (Bigg Building Pamphlet): describes that, \"On the roof is the viewing platform. To the left-most edge is a cherry tree. To the right-most edge is a candy stand.\"\n\nEvidence 17 (Ms. Hart's Picture): A photograph of the mysterious figure in the red raincoat.\n\nBut let's consider Evidence 8 (\"Kay's Recollections: Kay remembers a person coming from beyond the concession stand and pushing her off of the building.\").\n\nTestimony 4: Kay says, \"Umm... That's right, someone was walking towards me from the other side of that stand.\"\nThis matches Evidence 8.\n\nTestimony 3: \"But... from under the cherry tree... I feel like... I saw something red.\"\nBut the strongest visual contradiction seems to revolve around location and what could possibly be seen \"from under the cherry tree\" versus in \"a red raincoat.\"\n\nNow, look at Evidence 22 (Red Raincoat: Worn by the victim, whose fingerprints and blood were found on the hood). This could connect to \"seeing something red.\"\n\nBut let's look for an actual contradiction.\n\nEvidence 1 (Yatagarasu Pin): The Yatagarasu pin that Kay always wears.\n\nNone of the testimonies mention the pin.\n\nEvidence 2 (Jammin' Ninja Mask): Not in any of the testimonies.\n\nEvidence 8 (Kay's Recollections): \"Kay remembers a person coming from beyond the concession stand and pushing her off of the building.\"\nTestimony 3: \"But... from under the cherry tree... I feel like... I saw something red.\"\n\nHere's a contradiction: If Kay was under the cherry tree and saw something red, this could not be herself, since Kay is not wearing red, but the victim (Rosie Ringer, wearing a red raincoat) was. If Kay was under the cherry tree, and the red was the raincoat, and yet Kay's own recollection is being the one pushed, then Kay's recollection (evidence 8) and Testimony 3 seem to be at odds—because the person under the tree could have been the victim, not Kay.\n\nHence, the contradiction:\n- Testimony 3 (\"But... from under the cherry tree... I feel like... I saw something red.\") suggests Kay sees someone in red (the victim) under the cherry tree.\n- Evidence 8 (\"Kay remembers a person coming from beyond the concession stand and pushing her off\")—according to the map, someone coming from the candy stand side, not the cherry tree. Therefore, Kay herself can't be under the cherry tree and being pushed, unless her memories are confused.\n\nBut the best, most direct contradiction is between:\n- Evidence 8 (Kay's Recollections: She is the one being pushed, but saw someone red under the cherry tree—which would likely be the victim).\n- Testimony 3 (She says she saw something red from under the cherry tree, but actually the victim was in red—it suggests Kay's memory is inconsistent about who was where).\n\nFinal answer:",

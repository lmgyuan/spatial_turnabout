    "cot": "Evidence 11 (Autopsy Report) states: \"Cause of death: Stab wounds to chest. Head injury sustained post mortem. Death occurred as a result of a heavy blow to the head with a circular object. Chest wounds inflicted post-mortem.\" This means the chest wounds came *after* death and the fatal injury was to the head.\n\nTestimony 3 says: \"The wounds on her chest were postmortem. I relayed everything to Karin. After that, it was none of my beeswax!\" This matches the autopsy report and therefore is not a contradiction.\n\nLet's look at other testimonies:\n\nTestimony 0: \"There are no mistakes in Granny's autopsy reports!\"\n\nTestimony 1: \"I've been working with corpses longer than you've been alive.\"\n\nTestimony 2: \"There's no way I'd make a mistake in writing the autopsy report\" ...Ouch!\n\nTestimony 4: \"I got nothing to gain from falsifying the autopsy report.\"\n\nTestimony 5: \"...Is what she says. See? There's nothing strange at all!\"\n\nWait, Testimony 0, 2, and 4 are all about the *accuracy* of the autopsy report, but the content of the autopsy report itself (Evidence 11) and possibly statements from other witnesses could cause a contradiction.\n\nUpon re-reading:\n\nTestimony 0: \"There are no mistakes in Granny's autopsy reports!\"\n\nBut Evidence 11 seems to have a contradiction in itself: At first it says \"Cause of death: Stab wounds to chest. Head injury sustained post mortem.\" But immediately after it says: \"Death occurred as a result of a heavy blow to the head with a circular object. Chest wounds inflicted post-mortem.\"\n\nSo, if the chest wounds were *post-mortem*, then the *cause of death* was NOT the chest wounds, but the blow to the head. Yet the report says \"Cause of death: Stab wounds to chest,\" and elsewhere in the same report, \"Chest wounds inflicted post-mortem\" and \"Death occurred as a result of a heavy blow to the head.\"\n\nThus, the autopsy report contradicts itself, and Testimony 0's claim is that the autopsy report is always flawless (no mistakes).\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 11 (Autopsy Report) and Testimony 0.\n",

    "cot": "Let us examine Testimony 3: \"Maybe she was always wearing gloves in order to hide the burn mark, y'know.\" (by Blaise)\n\nNow look at the list of evidence. Evidence 14: Broken Plushie\nDescription includes: Based on the conversation, one of the people recorded was identified by having a prominent burn.\n\nSo the conversation about a burn is on a *recording* in the plushie. If the person was *always* wearing gloves, it would be difficult for someone to observe or refer to a burn—especially if the conversation is audio only. This potentially makes Blaise's statement about \"always wearing gloves\" inconsistent with the existence of a \"prominent burn\" identified in the audio recording.\n\nAlternatively, look at Evidence 16: Ringleader's Appearance\nThis states: Ringleader wore white jacket, white gloves, magenta flower, and mask. Also had a tattoo on the part of their face not covered by the mask.\n\nEvidence 22: Red Raincoat\nWorn by the victim, with fingerprints and blood found on the hood.\n\nGiven the Testimony 3 is about gloves to hide a burn, and Evidence 14 explicitly references a burn that was *noticed* and *identified* from an audio recording, the contradiction is: the burn was noticeable (hence identifiable), but Blaise claims the victim always wore gloves to hide the burn, implying it would not be seen or recognized.\n\nThus, the contradiction pair would be Evidence 14 and Testimony 3.\n",

    "cot": "Testimony 3 states: \"I SAW THAT THE BOMB'S TIMER WAS COUNTING DOWN.\" However, Evidence 2 (HH-3000 Bomb) states that the bomb \"can be detonated remotely\". If the bomb was detonated by remote rather than through a timer, there should not have been a countdown timer visible prior to the explosion, especially if the remote switch (Evidence 5) is missing and is required to start the countdown. Therefore, Tonate's claim about seeing the timer counting down contradicts the nature of how the bomb was set off, according to the evidence.\n",

However, Evidence 7, the Weather Data, says that snow was falling from 7 to 10:50 PM, and the bridge was struck by lightning at 10:45, which caused it to become impassable until repairs were made the next day. If Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time only after the bridge was fixed, he could not have been in contact with anyone at the Inner Temple side that night or the next morning before the repairs, which can contradict other testimonies about his whereabouts or actions.

    "cot": "Testimony 4 by Scuttlebutt claims that she is positive it was Juniper because \"she was wearing the costume that she had made,\" indicating that the figure was wearing a unique, recognizable stage costume. However, the photo attached actually shows \"the back of a figure in a plain blue costume,\" which directly contradicts Evidence 4, Stage Costume, which describes the actual costume as having \"a glowing star pattern\"—not plain blue. Thus, the testimony about positively identifying Juniper by her costume contradicts the evidence about what the stage costume actually looks like.\n",

Since Professor Courte was associated with the judge course and would often meet students in various parts of the academy (common for such meetings to take place in the art room which was involved in mock trial preparations), this meeting gives Hugh O'Conner a reason to be in the art room, directly contradicting his testimony.\n",

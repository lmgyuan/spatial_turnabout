It must have gotten there when the body was hidden inside.\"\n\nHowever, Evidence 5 observes: \"The body lying face-up on top of the dirt, and yet there's no dirt on the front of the body.\" If the body had been hidden inside the costume—especially one that had dirt inside—it would be expected that there would be dirt on the front of the body. The lack thereof suggests the body was not inside the costume.\n\nTherefore, Testimony 3 (\"Inside that monster costume...\") is contradicted by Evidence 5 (Crime Scene Notes).\n",

If the truck and balloon were regularly in use, Edgeworth wouldn't have only now seen it nor would it presumably be abandoned/missing its driver. The implication is that it was at the scene specifically for the incident, not routine advertising, which contradicts \"I often fly around that area for advertising purposes.\"\n\nThus, the contradiction:\nEvidence: 13 (Blue Truck, carrying the balloon, not routinely \"flying around\", but specifically moved recently)\nTestimony: 3 (Saint claims it's a routine route for advertising)\n",

    "cot": "Testimony 3 states that the body double pointed a gun at Simeon and fired while they were on the rooftop with Ms. Gravelle. However, Evidence 10 (Security Camera Footage) indicates that President Wang and Judge Gavèlle arrived on the roof, but there is no footage of the president (the double) taking the elevator down, which would be crucial if the shooting had happened on the rooftop and the double then left as described. The lack of such footage casts doubt on the events as described in Testimony 3.\n",

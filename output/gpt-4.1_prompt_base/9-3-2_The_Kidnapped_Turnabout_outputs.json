    "cot": "Lang's Testimony 3 claims that \"the two of them made good use of their meetings to plan this little kidnapping,\" which implies both Lauren Paups and Oliver Deacon worked together and planned the kidnapping as a team.\n\nHowever, Evidence 2 (Bad Badger's Head) and the investigation findings specify that this Bad Badger's Head was left in the Isolation Room. Furthermore, the list in Evidence 5 (Stolen Costumes) and other context suggest that Oliver Deacon was the Bad Badger and Lauren Paups was the Blue Badger, meaning that while involved in the chain of events, the nature of their involvement might not have been as co-conspirators.\n\nThe more direct contradiction is found between Testimony 3 and Evidence 16 (Mirror Fragments). The Mirror Fragments were found inside Oliver Deacon's costume—the Bad Badger. These were not part of a plan, but evidence of a struggle or incident involving Deacon, suggesting he may have been a victim or caught off guard, instead of an active planner working willingly with Lauren Paups. This makes a planned cooperative kidnapping implausible.\n\nTherefore, the evidence (Mirror Fragments in Deacon's costume) contradicts Lang's testimony that they worked together as co-conspirators.\n",

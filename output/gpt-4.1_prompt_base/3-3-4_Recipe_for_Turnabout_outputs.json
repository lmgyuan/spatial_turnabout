This directly contradicts Testimony 3 by Tigre, who claims, \"I waited around for him, but he ain't ever showed,\" implying the meeting never happened because Glen never appeared.\n\nHowever, the calendar entry from Glen's own possession suggests the meeting was scheduled and therefore planned on both sides, which puts Tigre's claim into doubt. The presence of this agreed-upon appointment in Glen's calendar suggests that the meeting was, at least from Glen's perspective, expected to occur—contradicting Tigre's portrayal of Glen as a no-show or as someone he never met.\n",

    "cot": "Evidence 14, \"Victim's Lottery Ticket,\" is a winning ticket for half a million dollars found during the body search of Maggey, confirming Glen Elg did win a large sum. Testimony 3 from Tigre says: \"I'm about to flatten the guy, when he starts screamin'.\" He suggests that he nearly attacked Glen, but Glen's luck with the lottery abruptly changed the situation. However, Evidence 20, \"Glen's Calendar,\" shows that Glen had an arrangement to meet with \"The Tiger\" (Tigre) specifically on the day of the incident, suggesting Tigre would have known about Glen's financial situation well before any attack, especially since Glen made an explicit appointment. This does not directly contradict the account as strictly as Evidence 7 and Evidence 23.\n\nBut, looking at Testimony 7: \"I was after the $100,000. I didn't have no other reason to kill the guy!\" and Evidence 23, \"MC Bomber\" (the computer virus made by Glen Elg that's potentially worth millions), there's a contradiction. Tigre claims that the only motive he saw was the $100,000 debt, but there was another valuable asset—MC Bomber—that is motive for the murder. Therefore, Testimony 7 is directly contradicted by Evidence 23.\n",

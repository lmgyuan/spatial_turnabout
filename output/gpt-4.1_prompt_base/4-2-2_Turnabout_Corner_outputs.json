Two rounds were fired. Fingerprints were wiped.\nEvidence 11: Meraktis's Autopsy Report - Time of death: June 14, after 10 PM.

The bullet hit the man pulling the stand from the front, square in the forehead!\n\nVersus the autopsy report:\nEvidence 11: Cause of death: Single bullet to the right temple.\n\nStickler claims the bullet hit the forehead (front), but the autopsy reports entry at the right temple (side of the head), which clearly contradicts his statement.\n\nSo, the best pairing is:\nEvidence 11 (Meraktis's Autopsy Report)\nTestimony 4 (shot to the \"forehead\")\n",

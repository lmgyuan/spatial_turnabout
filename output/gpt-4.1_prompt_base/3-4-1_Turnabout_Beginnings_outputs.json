You must only answer one pair. You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "cot": "Testimony 3 by Fawles states: \"Finally, one woman came. She stood front of me.\" This implies that Fawles met Valerie face-to-face on the bridge.\n\nHowever, Evidence 2 (Dusky Bridge Map) reveals: \"The view from the south of the bridge to the parking lot is obstructed by huge rocks.\" Furthermore, Evidence 6 (Witness's Photo) shows the positions: \"the victim [Valerie], wearing scarf and hat, is standing to the right, facing left... standing close to the broken end. A man in jail uniform and chains is facing the victim standing to the left.\"\n\nTaken together, the map suggests the bridge is broken midway towards the east, and the obstructed view would have made a direct meeting more difficultâ€”particularly as the bridge is impassable and broken. Thus, Fawles's claim that he stood on the bridge and talked to Valerie face-to-face is contradicted by the map, which indicates that the bridge is broken and possibly uncrossable at midway, preventing them from meeting in the position he describes.\n",

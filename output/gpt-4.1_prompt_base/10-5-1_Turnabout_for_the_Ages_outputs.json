    "cot": "Let’s look at Shi-Long Lang’s testimonies. He says (Testimony 3):\n\n\"There's no room for doubt! That woman murdered the president!\"\n\nHe is accusing \"that woman\" (contextually, Judge Gavèlle—see Character 6 and Testimony 0). The implication is that she murdered President Wang, and there is no doubt.\n\nNow, examine Evidence 10: Security Camera Footage.\n\nDescription: Shows President Wang and Judge Gavèlle in front of the elevator on the roof of the Bigg Building. Shows President Wang and Judge Gavèlle arriving on the roof of the Bigg Building. There's no footage of the president riding the elevator down to leave.\n\nThis evidence shows they *arrived* together but does NOT show Judge Gavèlle pushing the president off the roof, nor does it provide any direct proof of her guilt. Furthermore, the critical detail is that the footage only shows their arrival, NOT the act of murder or Gavèlle being alone with President Wang afterward, nor that she left the roof after having supposedly pushed him off. It does not support Lang’s assertion that it is without doubt that Gavèlle is the murderer.\n\nThus, Lang’s absolute certainty (\"there's no room for doubt!\") is contradicted by the evidence, which, in fact, does not provide a complete chain of proof and leaves reasonable doubt.\n",

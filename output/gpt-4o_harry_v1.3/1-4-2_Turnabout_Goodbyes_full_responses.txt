To find a contradiction, we can analyze Lotta's testimony and the relevant evidence. Lotta's testimony is that she saw "clear as day" the man on the boat and identified him as Mr. Edgeworth. However, the photo taken by Lotta's camera, which is set to take pictures automatically when it hears a noise, actually shows the outline or silhouette of a person in the boat, making it impossible to clearly identify the person as Edgeworth solely based on the photo.

This is a contradiction because Lotta claims to have seen the individual clearly enough to identify him, but the camera's evidence suggests that it would not be possible to make such a clear identification from that photo alone, undermining her testimony about the clarity of her observation.

**Evidence 4 (Lake Photo)**: Taken automatically on 12/25 at 12:15 AM. It probably shows an unclear image, reinforcing that the observation couldn't have been as certain as Lotta testifies.

**Testimony 0 (Lotta's testimony)**: She claims she saw Edgeworth clearly.

Thus, the Lake Photo contradicts Lotta's testimony that she could clearly see and identify the person on the boat.

In the list of evidence provided, Evidence 2, "Lotta's Camera," is set to automatically take pictures when a loud noise is detected. However, in Lotta's testimony 3, she mentioned that the camera was set up to take pictures of a meteor shower, which contradicts the automatic noise detection setting. Therefore, this is the pair that contradicts each other.

To identify the contradiction between the provided evidence and testimonies, we need to closely examine the statements and the details given in the evidence.

Lotta's testimonies generally focus on her actions and observations around the time of the incident at the lake. Specifically, Testimony 7 states: "Then I saw a flash, near one of the men's hands, and I heard another gunshot."

Evidence 11, Lotta's Deposition, states: "I heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25."

Let's analyze this information:

- Testimony 7 implies Lotta saw a flash and heard a second gunshot after the first one, suggesting her account saw two separate shooting actions.
- Evidence 10, the Pistol, notes that the murder weapon fired 3 times, while Lotta only refers to hearing two gunshots.
- Critically, Evidence 11, Lotta's Deposition, matches with her testimony of hearing two sounds, but does not confirm her seeing the flash.
- Evidence 11 provides her deposition account as simply hearing two gunshots.
- The contradiction lies in her additional visual observation of a flash, not recorded in her deposition, signifying a disparity from her auditory testimony focused solely on hearing.

Thus, there seems to be a contradiction between the second hearing of gunshots in Testimony 7 and the initial "bang" that triggered the camera capturing only the prior scene, suggesting her visual sighting may not align with the sounds discussed in the deposition. So, we review and find any missed evident observation by the camera.

But specifically, when reviewing lines of Lotta witnessing a flash, our available evidence suggests her camera would have deployed differently if appropriately capturing during timing discrepancies. This likely instance alludes more to her camera detecting only with loud noises, implying a contradiction in her seeing without evidence of sufficient audible cameraworks confirmation.

To summarize, the following evidence and testimony are the closest identified contradictions: Lotta's action of watched the boat just after her photographing set and standing by her hearing, when Evidence 16 shows an automatic camera confirmed with an empty observation, showing only an empty lake and capture with no flash visible, merely prior setting essentially describing no visible elements discernible directly captured at herself noticed.

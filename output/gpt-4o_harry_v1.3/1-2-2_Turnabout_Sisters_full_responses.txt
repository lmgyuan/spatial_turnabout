The contradiction lies between the evidence and testimony regarding what was written in blood. According to Detective Gumshoe's testimony, the lab tests showed the blood was the victim's, and the word "Maya" was written clearly in blood on a piece of paper found next to the victim's body. However, according to Evidence 3, the "Receipt," it is a department store receipt with letters written in blood on the back. This receipt contradicts the implication that a separate memo was specifically used for writing the killer's name, as stated in Testimony 2 and 3. The exact manner and place where the writing was found is important because Evidence 3 describes it appearing on a receipt, indicating a pre-existing document was used rather than a separate memo.

Therefore, there's a contradiction between Gumshoe's Testimony 2, which suggests the victim wrote "Maya" in blood, directly tying it to a memo specifically, and the description in Evidence 3 that covers where the blood letters were actually found (the receipt). If the victim wrote something in blood and the implication on a separate memo is false, it affects the credibility of the investigation around the piece of evidence found.

To identify a contradiction between evidence and testimony, let's analyze April's testimonies and compare them with the evidence provided.

Testimony 3 by April states: "And she hit her with that weapon! I saw it! I did!" This refers to the murder weapon, which April claims was used to hit the victim.

Let's compare this with Evidence 1, "The Thinker," which is described as "The murder weapon. Looks like a statue, but it's actually a clock." But here's the crucial point: it's later mentioned as "Clock in the form of a statue. The clock's gears have been removed." 

Considering this, April's claim that she saw the murder weapon suggests she might have recognized "The Thinker" as a weapon-clock correctly. However, for her to insist she saw the specific action occurring accurately implies she knew of its function beforehand or had firsthand knowledge. Since she claimed to have seen the action occurring from some distance, and the testimony only matches if she knew of its use as a clock-statue, its status as "just a statue" contradicts her specificity of observation.

The contradiction lies with:

- Testimony 4: "That... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? 'The Thinker,' I think?" - where she identifies it specifically as a clock.

Given the testimony and evidence:

There's a point in Testimony 4: April identifies it as a clock, not just seeing it as a statue or blunt object, claiming direct recognition, even without being able to observe its detail from afar during the commotion.

Thus, the contradiction makes itself apparent:

Testimony relies on insider knowledge of "The Thinker" as a clock, but identification from a witness at a distance identifying the function of "The Thinker" directly relates to awareness beyond just visual confirmation of the strike.

Evidence 1 and Testimony 4 contradict each other due to the reasoning above.

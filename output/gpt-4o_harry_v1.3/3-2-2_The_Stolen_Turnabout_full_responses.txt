The contradiction lies between Gumshoe's testimony about Mask☆DeMasque's pattern of always going after only the most precious art pieces (Testimony 3) and the evidence related to the Sacred Urn (Evidence 4). Gumshoe claims that Mask☆DeMasque goes after precious art pieces, but the Sacred Urn, despite being described as "supposedly priceless," actually has no monetary value and looks like a plain old pot. This indicates that Mask☆DeMasque, or whoever stole the urn, did not adhere to the described pattern.

To find a contradiction, let's analyze Luke Atmey's testimonies and the related evidence. 

Testimonies by Atmey:
- Testimony 0: He states it was around 1 o'clock in the morning when the incident happened.
- Testimony 1: Atmey describes a dramatic encounter with Mask☆DeMasque.
- Testimony 2: He mentions being struck and then rendered unconscious.
- Testimony 3: He says darkness "swallowed" him before he could react, and Mask☆DeMasque was gone when he awoke.
- Testimony 4: Thirty minutes later, he used an emergency phone to call the police.

Relevant evidence includes:
- Evidence 7 (Camera Data): The warehouse camera was triggered at around 1 AM.
- Evidence 19 (Buzzer Record): The CEO office buzzer went off at 1:02 AM on October 12.
- Evidence 15 (Kane's Autopsy Report): The time of death for Kane Bullard is listed as 1 AM on 10/12.
- Evidence 17 (CEO Office Buzzer): No fingerprints were found on the buzzer.

The contradiction arises with Testimony 4 (Atmey says he called the police thirty minutes later) and the Camera Data (Evidence 7) showing the camera was triggered at around 1 AM. If Atmey used the phone thirty minutes after 1 AM, that would be around 1:30 AM, conflicting with the timeline suggested by the camera activation.

However, considering the additional timing details, particularly the Buzzer Record (Evidence 19) showing the buzzer was pressed at 1:02 AM, a better contradiction might be inferred if timing around when Atmey said Mask☆DeMasque left (Testimony 3) does not align with other reported events.

The logical pairing is between Testimony 4 and the Camera Data, as the timing clashes with the established timeline of events directly captured in evidence form.

After analyzing the evidence and testimonies, there's a contradiction between Evidence 6 (Shichishito) and Testimony 5 (Atmey). The evidence mentions that the Shichishito was used to knock Atmey out with a blow to the back of the head, which directly contradicts Atmey's testimony where he mentions the thief's blow landed upon his "third eye," implying a frontal attack.

******************************
To identify a pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other, we will look for inconsistencies between what Ron claims and what the evidence suggests.

Ron’s Testimony 3 claims he donned a costume and descended onto the scene of the crime. However, the Sacred Urn was stolen, and from context, the crime scene involving this theft would be linked more to the Sacred Urn location rather than the night involving the murder of Kane Bullard. Relevant to this contradiction is Evidence 19, the "Buzzer Record," which shows the buzzer went off at 1:02 AM on October 12, indicating activity in the CEO's office at that specific time. Ron claims he was involved in the theft at the crime scene at the same time, but if we consider that the murder happened at 1 AM (as stated in Kane's Autopsy Report, Evidence 15), then it places him in the CEO's office and contradicts his claim of being at the scene of the crime for the heist involving the Urn. 

However, the clearer contradiction appears in Ron's Testimony 5, where he claims he snagged his broach on the door handle while descending upon the scene. Yet, Evidence 14, "DeMasque's Broach," was found in the shadow of Ami Fey's statue, not near any door. This misplacement suggests that the broach was not torn off by the door handle as claimed but lost in a different manner, likely during another incident or altercation. 

Thus, there is a contradiction between Ron's testimony about his attire and the placement of the broach at the scene.

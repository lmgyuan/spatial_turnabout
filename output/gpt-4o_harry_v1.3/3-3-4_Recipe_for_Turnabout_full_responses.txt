To identify a contradiction between the given evidences and testimonies, we need to carefully analyze both. Armstrong's testimony states that after the incident he moved the mirror, specifically Testimony 3: "After la terrible incident occurred, I move la mirror so it was not in z'e way." However, Evidence 12, the Crime Photo, shows that the scene was photographed very close to the time of the incident with the mirror still in its original position, obstructing the view from the entrance to the patio. This suggests that he might be lying or mistaken since the crime scene should have been preserved for investigation purposes.

Thus, Testimony 3 provided by Armstrong contradicts Evidence 12, the Crime Photo.

The contradiction lies between a testimony that claims no other customers were present and evidence indicating that Victor Kudo was there at the time of the incident. 

Testimony 3 by Jean Armstrong states: "Z'ere were no other customers." However, Victor Kudo's testimony and other evidences indicate he was present, as seen in Evidence 18 (Victor's Testimony): "When the incident occurred, I broke the vase at my seat. I'm sorry."

Thus, this contradiction suggests that Jean Armstrong's testimony that there were no other customers is false given that Victor Kudo was indeed present as a customer.

The contradiction lies between Tigre's testimony claiming that "I got whales lined up to borrow cash from Tender Lender every single day." and the evidence showing the "Repair Bill" indicating that Tigre needed $15,000 paid to the Cadaverini Family. This suggests that despite his claim of having many customers (or "whales"), he might be in financial trouble or requiring funds to make payments, thus contradicting his statement.

Testimony 3 from Tigre states that he waited for Glen Elg at his office, Tender Lender, for a meeting, but Glen never showed. However, Evidence 20, "Glen's Calendar," indicates that on December 3rd, Glen had a note in his calendar saying, "Meet with The Tiger." This suggests that Glen intended to meet with Tigre, contradicting the claim that Glen never showed up because it shows Glen's intention to meet Tigre. The clear plans to meet "The Tiger" (Tigre) suggest that Glen may have indeed attended the meeting or that there is more to the story than Tigre is admitting.

To identify a contradiction between evidence and testimony, we need to find a situation where a statement in a testimony conflicts with an established fact from the evidence.

Testimony 3 from Tigre states, "I figured if the place wasn't hot already, it was gonna be, so I split." This implies that Tigre left the restaurant quickly after witnessing the scene. However, Evidence 20, Glen's Calendar, indicates that there was a predetermined meeting with "The Tiger" (Furio Tigre's nickname) on December 3rd, the day of the incident. This suggests that Tigre had a reason to be there and should have stayed to fulfill this arrangement. Tigre's quick departure seems questionable, given the pre-arranged meeting with the victim, creating a contradiction.

To identify a contradiction between the evidence and testimonies, we need to carefully analyze the details given.

Evidence 14 is the "Victim's Lottery Ticket," stating the lottery ticket was a winning ticket for half a million dollars and was found during a body search of Maggey. 

Testimony 4 from Tigre mentions that the victim, Glen Elg, won half a million bucks and "got lucky." Tigre claims in his testimonies that he was in a confrontation with Glen over a debt, and Glen's sudden winning streak meant Glen had the means to pay Tigre.

The contradiction lies in the fact that Tigre claims to have not been after more than the 100,000 dollars Glen owed him (Testimony 7) and that he considers Glen won the 500,000 dollars. However, despite saying his business was over because the waitress did something, Glen had the means to pay back, indicating the possibility of Tigre targeting Glen for other reasons, possibly to obtain the lottery money (Evidence 14).

Therefore, Testimony 6 where Tigre mentions his business was over contradicts Evidence 14, as his business would have only been over if he acquired the lottery money, not just the original debt.

To determine which evidence contradicts Acro's testimony, we must analyze the evidence related to the crime and compare it with what Acro claims. 

Acro's testimonies suggest that he couldn't have exerted force on his lower body to have any effect on the murder committed on Russell Berry, the Ringmaster. However, the Crime Photo (Evidence 2) shows the crime scene where footprints leading to the victim are visible in the snow. This implies that the assailant must have been standing close to the victim, which makes it seem likely that Acro's claim about his inability to exert force on his lower body contradicts the footprints evident in the Crime Photo.

Acro's testimony 3 is specifically about exerting force on his lower body. The contradiction arises because if Acro couldn't exert force with his lower body, then it would be difficult to explain the footprints the Crime Photo shows without further evidence that he was able to get there by some other means.

Thus, the pair that contradicts each other is:

{"evidence": 2, "testimony": 3}

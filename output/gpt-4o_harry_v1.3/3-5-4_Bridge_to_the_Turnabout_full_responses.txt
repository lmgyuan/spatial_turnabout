Upon examining Iris's testimonies and the list of evidence, Testimony 3 states that Elise Deauxnim "threw her staff away and pulled a dagger from inside her robe." However, Evidence 9, the Victim's Staff, reveals that it had a sword hidden inside it, and there is no indication that Elise Deauxnim had a dagger hidden in her robe. Therefore, this testimony contradicts the evidence regarding the Victim's Staff.

To determine a contradiction between the given evidence and testimony, we need to focus on the specifics of the event described and cross-reference them with evidence details.

Testimony 3 by Iris claims that "Mystic Maya stabbed Mystic Elise." However, if we look at the Evidence 10, it states that the apparent murder weapon, Shichishito, had the victim's blood and the suspectâ€™s fingerprints on it but is not the murder weapon. Meanwhile, the autopsy report (Evidence 11) shows that Elise Deauxnim died due to a stab in the back, which occurred between 10 - 11 PM.

This testimony about the stabbing contradicts the Evidence 10 statement that the weapon with the suspect's fingerprints is not the murder weapon. This provides enough grounds to point towards a contradiction between Iris's description and the evidence regarding the murder weapon.

The testimony "I dragged it behind me all the way across Dusky Bridge." by Iris contradicts the Weather Data. According to the Weather Data, lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM, and the fire that ensued burned for about 30 minutes. If Iris dragged the body across the bridge, it would have been during or after this event, making it impossible due to the fire on the bridge.

One notable contradiction lies between Maya's claim in Testimony 4 about seeing a man by the light of the stone lantern, and the fact presented in Evidence 20, wherein it is stated that the stone lantern was not lit the night of the crime. If the stone lantern was not lit, then Maya could not have seen anyone by its light.

To identify a contradiction between the evidence and testimony provided, let's analyze the details given.

Maya's Testimony 3 states: "The torches were lit... And the body was gone."

However, Evidence 20 (Stone Lantern) states: "A lantern from the Inner Temple garden. Was not lit the night of the crime."

There is a contradiction in Maya's assertion that the torches were lit that night, as the evidence regarding the stone lantern indicates otherwise. With this, it signifies that Maya's testimony about the lighting conditions that night is inconsistent with the evidence associated with the stone lantern. 

Therefore, the evidence that contradicts Maya's Testimony 3 is Evidence 20.

******************************
Let's examine the testimonies and the evidence for potential contradictions.

Maya's testimony 3 states:

- "That's when Mr. Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time!"

If we look through the evidence list, we see Evidence 4, the Hanging Scroll, which is described as having Misty Fey's image obscured by gravy, but also includes a description by Godot: "clad in her stunning Japanese garb surrounded by the hue and aroma of Western tastes".

This indicates that Godot was at the Inner Temple earlier since he was able to describe the scroll with the gravy, suggesting he had already been there.

Thus, the testimony by Maya stating that "Mr. Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time!" is contradicted by the fact that Godot's earlier description of the scroll indicates a prior visit or knowledge of the place.

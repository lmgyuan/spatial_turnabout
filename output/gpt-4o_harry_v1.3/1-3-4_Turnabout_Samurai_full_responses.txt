Cody Hackins' testimonies mention that he saw the Steel Samurai take down the "bad guy" and wished he had his camera to capture the moment. However, it's known from the evidence that Cody did have his camera with him at all times, as indicated by Evidence 15, Cody's Camera. This contradiction suggests that Cody was either mistaken or lying about not having his camera at that critical moment.

******************************
Testimony 5 by Cody states that he took "a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em." This contradicts with Evidence 14, "Path to Glory," which contains photos of every victory scene in every battle the Steel Samurai has won. If Cody had erased all the shots that he took, then he would not have had any photos to contribute to "Path to Glory." This suggests that not all shots were erased, thus contradicting his testimony.

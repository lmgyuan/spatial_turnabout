To find a contradiction between the evidence and testimonies, let's carefully examine both. 

The testimony given by Atmey was: "I knew it was an extremely valuable treasure, so I sent my card 10 days beforehand."

Now, let's look at the evidence. We have the "DeMasque's Calling Card" (Evidence 5), which has a message indicating it was sent to the Security at Lordly Tailor, alerting them that Mask DeMasque will be coming to steal the "most priceless work of art" on display in the Treasures of Kurain exhibit. The message specifically points out the "speckled urn," which is the Sacred Urn.

The contradiction arises because Atmey's testimony claims he sent the calling card 10 days beforehand due to the urn being extremely valuable. However, the calling card itself specifies that they knew and mentioned the exact item they intended to steal as the most priceless item in the display, which implies Mask DeMasque (Atmey, in this hypothetical scenario) had already decided on stealing the urn prior to sending any card.

The contradiction is between the timing and reason for sending the card and the explicit target mentioned on the card itself indicating a premeditated plan hatched well in advance of 'seeing' the urn or confirming its value.

To determine which evidence and testimony contradict each other, we need to analyze the provided statements and the given evidences.

Testimony 3 from Luke Atmey claims: "And it was again Mr. Bullard who harbored a grudge against Mr. DeLite for his betrayal!"

However, let's examine the context with Evidence 10, the Blackmail Letter:

Evidence 10 (Blackmail Letter): It was written by Bullard and found in Ron's room. The letter states, "If you don't want your true identity revealed to the world, come to KB security at 1:00 AM on October 12th and bring $50,000."

This evidence shows that Bullard was blackmailing Ron DeLite, contrary to the idea of him having a grudge for betrayal. Instead, it establishes Bullard's role in coercing DeLite, meaning the motive of a betrayal-driven grudge does not align, thereby creating a contradiction.

To find a contradiction between evidence and testimony, we need to identify inconsistencies between what is described in testimonies and what the evidence suggests.

Looking at the testimonies from Miles Edgeworth about the DL-6 Incident:
- Testimony 3 states, "Just then, something heavy fell at my feet."
- Testimony 4 says, "I picked it up, and threw it at Mr. Yogi."

Now, focusing on the evidence related to the DL-6 Incident:
- Evidence 18, the DL-6 Case File, mentions "the murder weapon was fired twice."

From Testimony 5, we hear about "a single gunshot," which does not directly align with the evidence indicating the weapon was fired twice in that incident. 

However, focusing on the presented details, the testimony that one gunshot was heard conflicts with the evidence stating the gun was fired twice during the event.

The contradiction lies in the following: 

Edgeworth recalls hearing a single gunshot in his testimony, but the DL-6 Case File states that the murder weapon was fired twice, indicating more gunshots than Edgeworth claims to have heard. 

Conclusion:
Testimony 5 contradicts Evidence 18 because there is a discrepancy in the number of gunshots reported.

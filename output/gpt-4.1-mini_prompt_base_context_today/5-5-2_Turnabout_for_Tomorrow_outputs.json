The sins we've committed... and the sadness we've caused... No matter how far we run, our past remains... ...as ever-present as the moon in the sky. It looms in wait... for the day when we are forced to face it. But only in doing so can we truly make peace and move on in hope towards tomorrow. December 20, 1:23 PMWright Anything Agency Phoenix: (They took Athena from the courtroom, straight to the station. She's probably being questioned at this very moment.) ............ (After this past year, I took it for granted that those two would always be here. But now, Apollo has gone off on his own to seek his own truth... ...and my pursuit of the truth only ended up with Athena becoming the new suspect. Some boss I turned out to be...) Trucy: ............ It's even quieter in here than usual. Phoenix: Yeah... It seems so empty, too. Trucy: I just don't get it, Daddy. All of your reasoning during the trial seemed perfectly solid... Phoenix: Yeah... And I still believe it was... At least, based on what we know. Trucy: But now, Athena is the one who's being accused... Phoenix: During the trial for the bombing and murder that occurred at the Cosmos Space Center... ...the lighter used by the real culprit was found. This lighter proved the defendant, Solomon Starbuck, innocent. But Athena's prints were found on it instead... ...and she was subsequently arrested for the murder. Trucy: But Athena couldn't have done it. It just doesn't make any sense. Phoenix: (No, none of it does. I've been racking my brain, but I just can't figure it out! Argh! Where is the flaw in my reasoning? What have I got wrong in this case?) Trucy: You know, Daddy... if Athena was here... ...she wouldn't just be sitting around thinking. She'd be out there doing something. You ARE going to defend Athena, right, Daddy? Phoenix: Of course I will! And thanks, Trucy. I needed that push. (Trucy's right! The trial is tomorrow. There's no time to waste! If I'm going to prove Athena's innocence, I'd better get out there and find some evidence!) Trucy: Off we go, then! We're on a hunt for evidence that'll prove Athena's innocence! Phoenix: (Great! But before we go, I'd better tidy up the evidence I have on hand...) Unnecessary evidence left at the office. Phoenix: (Athena is probably still in the middle of being questioned... ...so Trucy's right. The thing to start with is talking to people at the Space Center.) Talk What to do Trucy: I still can't believe Apollo really left us... Phoenix: It was so sudden. Trucy: Maybe he got tired of being my assistant for my magic tricks? Phoenix: I don't think it's your fault, Trucy. Trucy: B-But I made him clean the toilet a lot! And I made him go bring in the newspaper! It WAS my fault! I just know it! Oh, Apollo! *sniffle* Phoenix: I really don't think it was your fault, Trucy. But I didn't realize Apollo was wearing so many hats around here, either. Any ideas? Trucy: How could they suspect Athena? It's just ridiculous. It must be some kind of conspiracy. Phoenix: A conspiracy, huh? Well, it certainly is some kind of mistake, that's for sure. Trucy: First of all, we have to bust Athena out of the Detention Center. Then we have to chase down the people who framed her. We'll sneak around the world, from Kiev to Carolina, with the fuzz hot on our tails! Phoenix: Isn't that exactly the same as the plot of the movie you watched the other day? Present Attorney's Badge Trucy: I guess presenting your attorney's badge... ...is like your \"quick trick,\" huh, Daddy? Phoenix: Ha ha ha. So it's just a trick to you, huh? Trucy: Well, you are one of the talents in our Wright Anything Agency, after all. But I have to say that an attorney's badge won't get many laughs... Phoenix: I don't care if I get laughs, as long as I can clear my client's name. Trucy: Ha ha ha! That's a good one, Daddy! Phoenix: I'm no match for you, though, Trucy. Space Center Pamphlet Trucy: Space, huh... I'd sure love to go up there someday. Will you take me, Daddy? Phoenix: Ha ha ha. It's not like taking somebody to an amusement park, you know. Trucy: Well, you hardly ever take me to one of those, either! You either say, \"I don't have any money\" or \"I don't have time\"! Phoenix: F-Fine. I'll take you on my next day off. Trucy: You're the best, Daddy! Phoenix: Ha ha ha. (I'm no match for Trucy...) Anything else Trucy: Daddy, you should be careful about showing evidence to a magician. Phoenix: That's true. You can make anything disappear. Trucy: Well, anything up to about a yard in diameter, anyway. My magic panties are an extra-dimensional space! Phoenix: I guess only a space probe can help us figure out how they work then, huh. December 20Cosmos Space Center - Entrance Phoenix: Director Cosmos! Do you have a minute?! Cosmos: Urgk! Galactic Scooter! Full speed ahead! Phoenix: Director! (He scooted away...) Trucy: His expression changed the instant he saw you, Daddy! Phoenix: (Yeah, well, I dragged his name through the mud pretty good at the trial earlier today...) December 20Cosmos Space Center - Boarding Lounge Phoenix: We were here only yesterday... Oh, hey! Mr. Starbuck! You've been released, huh? Starbuck: Yup. And I came straight here. This is all thanks to you and your team, Mr. Wright! You've given me a second chance to fly into space again. I can't thank you enough. Except... Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... Phoenix: Wh-What's wrong? (I thought he'd be happy to be acquitted...) Starbuck: As I was coming out of the Detention Center, I saw Miss Cykes. Phoenix: (H-He saw Athena?) Starbuck: I was at a loss for words. I didn't know what to say to the poor girl. And then, you know what? She flashed a peace sign at me. \"Congratulations on your acquittal,\" she said. \"Now you can go back into space someday.\" Phoenix: (Yeah, that sounds like Athena. I can just picture it.) Starbuck: But I saw her eyes. They were red and swollen from crying. She's gotta be suffering! She must be so worried! And yet she went out of her way to be nice and give me that big smile! Trucy: She held back her own tears so she could give someone else a smile. That's... so Athena. Starbuck: There's no question about it. That girl is innocent. Please, Mr. Wright. You have to make sure she goes free! And then, they can put me in prison instead! I don't mind! Phoenix: (We can't have that either, Mr. Starbuck!) Don't worry, Mr. Starbuck. I'm going to give her the very best defense I can. I promise to get her acquitted, just like I did for you. Starbuck: I know she'll be all right with you in her corner. I know you'll never give up on her. Apollo has a fine boss to look up to! Talk About the murder Starbuck: I still can't believe Launch Pad 1 was switched with the Space Museum... Phoenix: What could have made Director Cosmos do such a thing? Starbuck: I haven't the foggiest idea. Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... So there never was gonna be a launch that day, not from the very beginning... I wonder if Clay knew...? Phoenix: I imagine he must have. Surely he would've noticed when you went to board the rocket. Starbuck: It's pathetic to think I was the only one who got taken in. Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... But I guess that's about how it goes, when you're worth less than space debris. Trucy: Is he... going to be all right, Daddy? His expression looks as dark as a black hole... Phoenix: Well... That's just how he is. The murderer (appears after \"About the murder\") Phoenix: Mr. Starbuck, do you remember anything about the murderer? Starbuck: Not really. I only saw a shadowy figure in the dark after all. Phoenix: (Yeah, I guess that was a little too much to hope for...) Starbuck: Hey, I heard something from the police, though. They said they never did find a .10-caliber gun down that trash chute. Phoenix: Just as I thought. The culprit must've carried it away with them when they escaped. Trucy: So, was the person you saw holding a gun, Mr. Starbuck? Starbuck: Umm... I couldn't really tell. Phoenix: But it wasn't Athena, right? Could you tell if the person was male or female, tall or short? Starbuck: I-I can't even tell you that much. Man, I'm useless... When the culprit opened the door and some light came in, I should've been able to see... Phoenix: The door... Ah, yes... As I recall, they opened this door here as they made their escape... Trucy: The door to Launch Pad 1, right? Starbuck: Yeah, except, right now, the door leads to the Space Museum. Phoenix: You mean the launch pad and the Space Museum are switched right now? Starbuck: Yeah, they're trying to investigate the theory you came up with in court. Phoenix: So they're recreating the conditions, huh? (I'd like to see what's beyond that door now.) Mr. Starbuck, could you open this door for us? Starbuck: Sure. Just let me have my prints scanned here... The murderer (subsequent times) Phoenix: Mr. Starbuck, do you remember anything about the murderer? Starbuck: Not really. I only saw a shadowy figure in the dark after all. Phoenix: (Yeah, I guess that was a little too much to hope for...) Starbuck: Hey, I heard something from the police, though. They said they never did find a .10-caliber gun down that trash chute. Phoenix: Just as I thought. The culprit must've carried it away with them when they escaped. Trucy: So, was the person you saw holding a gun, Mr. Starbuck? Starbuck: Umm... I couldn't really tell. Phoenix: But it wasn't Athena, right? Could you tell if the person was male or female, tall or short? Starbuck: I-I can't even tell you that much. Man, I'm useless... When the culprit opened the door and some light came in, I should've been able to see... Switching the launch pads (appears after \"The murderer\") Leads to: \"Do the launch pads get switched back and forth a lot?\" Present Terran's Autopsy Report Starbuck: Clay always used to cheerfully greet me in a loud voice. Phoenix: And he did vocal exercises every morning, sometimes until he was hoarse, right? Starbuck: Exactly. You could always hear him, even through the wall-- Hey, wait a minute. Did you know Clay? Phoenix: No, but like attracts like, as they say. Anything else Phoenix: Do you know anything about this piece of evidence? Starbuck: No... Sorry I'm so useless... Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... Phoenix: No, no. It's all right. There's no need to get all depressed! Phoenix: Do the launch pads get switched back and forth a lot? Starbuck: Well, back when the Space Museum was Launch Pad 2... ...they used to switch the pads around at times. Phoenix: But these days, Launch Pad 2 is only used as a tourist attraction, right? Starbuck: Right. 'Cause, quite frankly, the Space Center needs the money. Phoenix: (I hear you... Times sure are tough...) Trucy: Daddy, let's go check out what's beyond that door! Phoenix: Sure. Let's go. Starbuck: Hey, why don't I come along? I can show you around! Examine Leaves Phoenix: Huh? I wonder what these dead leaves are doing here? Trucy: Maybe they were stuck to the bottom of somebody's shoes. There are lots of trees around the Space Center. Phoenix: (She's right. It's a modern, state-of-the-art building, but it's surrounded by trees.) But I don't know. If they were stuck to the bottom of somebody's shoes... ...wouldn't they look more crushed up? These don't look like they've been stepped on. Trucy: Maybe there's some kind of secret hatch in the corridor, and they came in that way? Phoenix: Not everything is set up like a magician's stage, you know. Fingerprint scanner Phoenix: So this is another one of those devices for opening the door, huh? Starbuck: Yup. But this one doesn't require fingerprint verification. You just hit the button and \"open sesame\"! Trucy: So when you and Clay went through here, you didn't need to show your prints, either? Phoenix: That's right, Trucy. Just like how the culprit didn't need to scan their prints... ...when they escaped back out of the Space Museum corridor into Boarding Lounge 2. Launch Pad 1 Door Lock updated in the Court Record. Fingerprint scanner (subsequent times) Phoenix: So this is another one of those devices for opening the door, huh? Starbuck: Yup. But this one doesn't require fingerprint verification. You just hit the button and \"open sesame\"! Trucy: So when you and Clay went through here, you didn't need to show your prints, either? Phoenix: That's right, Trucy. Just like how the culprit didn't need to scan their prints... ...when they escaped back out of the Space Museum corridor into Boarding Lounge 2. After examining leaves and fingerprint scanner: Phoenix: (Well, I don't see anything else that jumps out at me. And I imagine this corridor is built exactly like the Launch Pad 1 corridor.) Talk Switching the launch pads Phoenix: Do the launch pads get switched back and forth a lot? Starbuck: Well, back when the Space Museum was Launch Pad 2... ...they used to switch the pads around at times. Phoenix: But these days, Launch Pad 2 is only used as a tourist attraction, right? Starbuck: Right. 'Cause, quite frankly, the Space Center needs the money. Phoenix: (I hear you... Times sure are tough...) Trucy: So, right now, this Boarding Lounge 1 is connected to the Space Museum... Phoenix: I guess the police are trying to re-create the conditions of the crime. Trucy: And just now, when we checked the hallway on the other side of the door... Phoenix: Yeah, it looks like that door opens from the corridor side without fingerprint verification. Trucy: So when Clay and Mr. Starbuck went through, they didn't need to scan their prints, either. Phoenix: That's right. Just like how the culprit didn't need to scan their prints... ...when they escaped back out of the Space Museum corridor into Boarding Lounge 2. Trucy: And remember there were those dead leaves in the corridor? I wonder where they came from? Hmm... I still think maybe they were stuck to the bottom of somebody's shoes. Phoenix: (I don't know. Those leaves didn't look like they'd been stepped on to me...) December 20Cosmos Space Center - Entrance Cosmos: Urgn! Curse the wretch who sullied my good name! Reverse course and full speed away! Phoenix: Director Cosmos! Wait! Trucy: I'll handle this, Daddy! Take that! Cosmos: Gaaaaagh! The mobility system has been compromised! Phoenix: (Trucy's knife throw was a direct hit to one of his tires!) Trucy: And the streak continues! Phoenix: (Maybe I should've kept a closer watch on what tricks she's been practicing...) Cosmos: My dear, old battleship! We fought many a skirmish together! It has been an honor... Trucy: Daddy! He's going to blow that thing up! Phoenix: Nah. I bet all that button will do is make it go haywire again. Cosmos: ............Very well. I surrender. As a prisoner of war, I expect to be treated honorably. Talk Switching the launch pads Phoenix: Director Cosmos, when you were talking in court about switching the launch pads... ...you used your right to remain silent about the reason as to why. Phoenix: I'd like Director Cosmos to tell us... ...why he switched the two launch pads to begin with. Cosmos: Nnngh... Please... I can't... I... I exercise my right to remain silent... But I will say... my hands were tied... I was only doing what I could to keep my men from getting caught in that blast. Nngh... Nnnggggh... Cosmos: The center of the cosmos is shrouded in mystery! But I don't have any secrets left... ...now that my battleship has been destroyed and I've been taken prisoner! 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (No secrets left, huh? I beg to differ. Looks like I'll have to undo his Psyche-Locks if I want to get to the bottom of this.) Present Magatama Phoenix: 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Behind the Switching of the Launch Pads -- Phoenix: I want you to tell me everything you're hiding about the switching of the two launch pads. Cosmos: I refuse! You can't make me! I can hold out longer than anyone! Phoenix: (I hope I never get like this when I'm old... Now, let's see. Where to start?) This is how you explained your motive for switching the launch pads. You did it... To fool the bomber Phoenix: You said your motive was to fool the bomber, right? Cosmos: No, by then, the bomb had already been set. Switching the launch pads after the fact would have done nothing to fool the bomber. Phoenix: (Huh? Ugh, I guess I got it wrong.) Ha ha. That was just a little joke. Now I'll tell you what you really said at the trial. Leads back to: \"This is how you explained your motive for switching the launch pads. You did it...\" To prevent the bombing Phoenix: You said your motive was to prevent the bombing, right? Cosmos: Hmph. So what you're saying is... ...that even though I switched the launch pads to prevent the bombing from happening... ...it ended up happening anyway, and I am nothing but a big fool?! Phoenix: (Well, I never said that last bit...) Ha ha. That was just a little joke. Now I'll tell you what you really said at the trial. Leads back to: \"This is how you explained your motive for switching the launch pads. You did it...\" To save the astronauts Leads to: \"Thanks to you switching the launch pads, the astronauts escaped injury from the blast.\" Phoenix: Thanks to you switching the launch pads, the astronauts escaped injury from the blast. Instead, they safely boarded the Museum's rocket, far away from the actual explosion. Cosmos: Hmph! My astronauts were raring to go out on an authentic adventure in space! How do you propose I had them board a fake rocket without them noticing?! Phoenix: ...I agree you couldn't have done it without help. For one, they would have figured it out the instant they stepped into the Space Museum. You figured you could fool Mr. Starbuck once he'd been drugged with his medication, but... ...without the help of this person, it would've been impossible to pull your plan off. Present Clay Terran profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"You must have gotten Mr. Terran to help you.\" Present anyone else Phoenix: Phoenix: It wasn't this person, was it? Cosmos: Are we done here? I'm quite busy with the aftermath of the incident, you know. Phoenix: (Oh... Guess I was right about being wrong...) ...Well, I did say it \"WASN'T this person,\" didn't I? But I still contend that... Leads back to: \"...without the help of this person, it would've been impossible to pull your plan off.\" Phoenix: You must have gotten Mr. Terran to help you. Cosmos: Urghk! Phoenix: He stole the tranquilizers from his mentor's locker and slipped them to him. And then, with Mr. Starbuck in a daze, they boarded the replica rocket in the museum! Cosmos: Aaaaagh! Someone please help this poor prisoner of war! Phoenix: (How is he able to spin around like that...?) 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: If you really wanted to save the astronauts' lives... ...shouldn't you just have called off the launch? Cosmos: If I could have done that, do you think I would have gone to all that trouble?! Phoenix: (I guess he must've had a compelling reason why he couldn't call it off...) But how did you know to switch the pads in advance of the bombing incident? Cosmos: W-Well, that's because... nrgh... I was warned in advance. Once I received that warning, it was my duty to ensure my astronauts' safety! Phoenix: But it was just a warning. It could even have been a prank. Why did you believe in it so completely? Cosmos: B-Because I went to one of those \"mediums\" that everyone's talking about these days. Phoenix: Oh? I didn't realize channeling was back in vogue. ...Besides, I thought it was you yourself that got the warning via telephone. Cosmos: Yes, that's right! The bomber contacted me personally. My battleship is equipped with a special advanced communications system, you see! Phoenix: (AKA, a regular ol' telephone.) Cosmos: \"It's been a while. Planning another launch? I see you haven't learned...\" I'll never forget the terror I felt when I received that call. Phoenix: The bomber said, \"It's been a while\"...? And that was enough to make you take the threat seriously? (Perhaps Director Cosmos took the threat so seriously... ...because the Space Center had been involved in a bombing once before? Maybe... ...the culprit in the current case is the same person who was involved in this incident!) The Courtroom No. 4 bombing Phoenix: It was the courtroom bombing, wasn't it?! That's when you were dealt a major blow! Cosmos: Do you really think blowing up a courtroom would've shaken the center of the cosmos? Phoenix: Gaaagh... (I guess I got it wrong... The director felt personally threatened, so it has to be something more relevant to him. ) Leads back to: \"...the culprit in the current case is the same person who was involved in this incident!\" The HAT-1 Miracle Leads to: \"The HAT-1 Miracle, that epic story of survival...\" The HAT-2 bombing Phoenix: The HAT-2 bombing. That must be where the answer to your secret lies. Cosmos: All hands! Ready the Galactic Scooter's main turrets! Teach this blockhead what a precision shot is all about! Phoenix: Aaaaaaagh! You got me! (Unh... I guess I was way off on that one... Now, let's see...) Leads back to: \"...the culprit in the current case is the same person who was involved in this incident!\" Phoenix: The HAT-1 Miracle, that epic story of survival... People across the nation know it now as a heroic tale of bravery. But in truth, it was an act of sabotage perpetrated by our current killer, wasn't it? Very few knew about the previous plot, so when the caller said, \"It's been a while\"... ...you knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that the danger was real, and it wasn't a prank! Cosmos: Gaaaaaaagh! Didn't anyone ever tell you to go easy on an ex-serviceman?! 1 LOCK BROKEN Cosmos: ...Yes, the HAT-1 Miracle was really a desperate battle against an act of sabotage. I even lost the life of one of my staff members in the fight. Phoenix: (Sabotage, murder... So this is the ugly truth behind the HAT-1 Miracle.) Cosmos: I let my guard down... I thought the saboteur had been caught, and that the case was closed. Phoenix: (...Huh? Wait a minute... The murder at the Space Center seven years ago...! This must be the person Director Cosmos thought was the culprit.) Present Simon Blackquill profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Simon Blackquill, the murder suspect in a case that happened here seven years ago.\" Present anyone else Phoenix: Cosmos: Mr. Lawyer, you must be very tired. Why don't you take a nap in one of our zero-gravity beds? Phoenix: (...I guess I picked the wrong person. Although I do like the sound of a zero-g nap right about now... But that will have to wait! I still have a Psyche-Lock left to break!) Leads back to: \"This must be the person Director Cosmos thought was the culprit.\" Phoenix: Simon Blackquill, the murder suspect in a case that happened here seven years ago. That place and time of the two incidents -- the murder and the sabotage -- were the same. So you thought that he committed both crimes. But while Prosecutor Blackquill was behind bars, you got another threatening call. If the culprit this time is the same as seven years ago, then it isn't Simon Blackquill. Realizing that, you were shaken. It meant the true culprit's been running free all this time. Cosmos: Ngaaagh... How do you keep seeing straight through me?! 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Switching the launch pads (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Phoenix: (The reason why Director Cosmos won't talk about why he switched the launch pads... ...is connected to the truth behind the HAT-1 Miracle. The sabotage and murder that happened at this Space Center seven years ago...) Director Cosmos, tell us what you're hiding! Cosmos: If you really want to understand the reason I decided to switch the launch pads... ...we'll have to start with the story of that horrible nightmare from seven years ago. Phoenix: Seven years ago... You mean the so-called \"HAT-1 Miracle\"? Cosmos: The launch went smoothly, but once the ship entered outer space, then the troubles began. It was all the handiwork of a certain person and their evil scheme. Phoenix: (So Mr. Starbuck's traumatic experience wasn't accidental...) Cosmos: Not only that, but before the launch, a very valuable piece of moon rock was stolen. But that wasn't the worst of it! One of my staff members was murdered! Trucy: Wow. I had no idea such awful events were behind that exciting story of space heroism... Cosmos: All that, in spite of the Space Center having very strict security in those days. All personal effects were examined thoroughly, coming or going. You couldn't even smuggle a withered old leaf through those checkpoints! Phoenix: So... do you have any clue who was responsible for the sabotage...? Cosmos: At the very least, I know it wasn't Simon Blackquill. I don't know enough to identify the true culprit, but it's clear WHAT that person is. To put it simply............ a spy. Trucy: A spy?! You mean somebody who infiltrates a foreign country... ...carries out dangerous missions, and always gets the girl?! Phoenix: (Someone's watching way too many late-night movies.) Well, I guess if we're talking about blowing up a rocket and stealing research material... ...it's not all that surprising that a spy could be behind it all. The spy (appears after \"Switching the launch pads\") Cosmos: Make no mistake! There's cutthroat rivalry between nations in the space R&D race. Some try to outdo others by any means possible, even deliberate obstructions. Seven years ago, we got a call before the launch warning us of sabotage. Phoenix: The same MO as this time... Cosmos: Yes. And here I thought the perpetrator had been caught, but it looks like I was wrong. Trucy: Prosecutor Blackquill seems more like a ninja than a spy, don'tcha think? Phoenix: (Aren't ninjas and spies basically the same thing?) Cosmos: But there's a good reason we failed to find the real spy... ...A massive cover-up by the government. Government officials were too embarrassed to admit... ...that they had allowed such a thing to happen at the hands of a spy. Phoenix: Don't tell me they made the police rush the investigation? Cosmos: They did indeed. And then, to cover up the sabotage, they cleaned up the story. Phoenix: And that was \"The HAT-1 Miracle,\" wasn't it? (But then, seven years later, the same MO -- advance warning of sabotage... That must've been the director's reason for switching the launch pads.) Just like seven years ago (appears after \"The spy\") Phoenix: Seven years ago, the spy gave you advance warning of their plans, just like this time. That was what made you decide to switch the launch pads, wasn't it? Cosmos: That's right. The caller knew the facts of the case seven years ago, despite the cover-up. They knew about the sabotage, the moon rock, the murder. And they said... ...\"You don't want things to go like they did seven years ago, do you?\" I immediately thought of calling off the launch, but the government wouldn't let me! \"We don't give in to the likes of terrorists! We must proceed for our country's honor!\" It was quite a moving speech, actually. Phoenix: (\"Moving\"? Really? Maybe if you're easily inspired by political talking points...) Cosmos: But I knew the truth. We had been warned, which meant that the danger was very real. And I knew there was no way to stop the spy. No matter what I did, they would find a way. That's why I switched the launch pads, and staged the moving rescue scene. First, I snuck into the Center the night before and switched the launch pads. That way, the astronauts would go from Boarding Lounge 1 to the Space Museum. Then, I put a \"closed for repairs\" sign at the door to Launch Pad 1 in Boarding Lounge 2. Phoenix: You did that so normal visitors wouldn't enter, right? What else did you do? Cosmos: I enlisted the help of several staff members, including Terran. Phoenix: But you didn't let Mr. Starbuck in on it? Cosmos: He'd already been through enough, and he's no good at lying to keep a secret... I'm afraid I had no choice but to have him drugged. My plan went well, until... Trucy: ...Clay's murder, huh... Cosmos: After the culprit made their escape, I switched the launch pads back. I did it in such a way that no one would find out. But after all that effort... ...Terran is dead, and the HAT-2 is destroyed! And the Hope capsule, which had returned to us only recently, was also lost in that blast! My home, the center of the cosmos... my beautiful Cosmos Space Center is done for! Phoenix: (Wait, what did he mean by the Hope capsule was lost in that blast...?) The \"Hope\" capsule (appears after \"Just like seven years ago\") Phoenix: I thought that the Hope capsule was found at the crime scene with Mr. Terran. It had just been brought back by the Hope space probe with asteroid samples inside. Phoenix: So what kind of samples are they? What's in them? Cosmos: ............The samples are scheduled for analysis in the near future. We haven't had time, since they just came back the day before Terran's murder. Cosmos: The capsule was being held in a safe in Launch Pad 1... ...but I gave it to Terran before the incident so it wouldn't be destroyed in the explosion. The idea was that, with it safely in Terran's possession... ...he could make it look like he rescued it during the staged \"miraculous escape.\" But our precious research materials... ended up lost to that explosion anyway... Trucy: But I thought Clay was supposed to keep it safe? Cosmos: You misunderstand. The launch pad explosion wasn't the one the capsule was lost to... It was lost after the police confiscated it as evidence. It was the courtroom bombing from the other day. The capsule was there in the courtroom as evidence, and was blown to smithereens! Phoenix: (Yet another casualty of that blast...) Cosmos: Ultimately, I think the culprit may have known about the switching of the launch pads. Phoenix: What? H-How? Cosmos: The police found a wiretapping device during their investigation today. A bug aboard my battleship, a tap on my advanced communications system! Phoenix: A wire on that phone? Cosmos: Yes... A wire on this very phone. I used this phone to give instructions to my staff about the launch pad switch. Just to the few select members who knew about the plan. Just before the incident, staff members were coming in and out of Launch Pad 1. The culprit probably slipped in with them amid the confusion... Phoenix: And planted the bomb then... Yes, if they were tapping your phone, they definitely could pull something like that off. So you really think the same spy is behind this incident and the one seven years ago? Cosmos: Yes. I'm sure of it. Phoenix: Then, this spy... must be the \"phantom\" Prosecutor Blackquill has been chasing... Fulbright: But Prosecutor Blackquill told me once... \"The hunt I've been on for the phantom of seven years past continues even still.\" Fulbright: For starters, that case happened right here at this very Space Center, too. Trucy: So if we can find this \"phantom\"...! Phoenix: That's right. We can clear Athena's name. And then there's the matter of Prosecutor Blackquill, too. Trucy: What about him? Phoenix: Well, IF the culprit of seven years ago is the same person as in the current incident... ...it would mean Prosecutor Blackquill is innocent. That's still an \"if,\" though... Trucy: Hmm... I wonder how dangerous that guy would be in court without handcuffs...? But if we're going on a ghost hunt, count me in! Cosmos: Hee hee hee... Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! It's all over for me! Spin! Spin! Whirl! Whirl! I'm done for! The center of the cosmos is doomed! Trucy: Do you think he's going to be all right, Daddy? Phoenix: Well, at least he'll be in good company. There must be planets out there he can spin with. Which reminds me... I'd like to delve a little deeper into the HAT-1 mission, too. Cosmos: If you want to learn more, start with the Space Museum. There's a HAT-1 exhibit there. Oh, don't mind me. I'll just keep spinning here and see how the cosmos unfolds... Trucy: It's like he achieved spiritual enlightenment or something! Phoenix: I'm sure he'll stop when he gets dizzy. Let's go visit the Space Museum! The \"Hope\" capsule (subsequent times) Phoenix: I thought that the Hope capsule was found at the crime scene with Mr. Terran. It had just been brought back by the Hope space probe with asteroid samples inside. Phoenix: So what kind of samples are they? What's in them? Cosmos: ............The samples are scheduled for analysis in the near future. We haven't had time, since they just came back the day before Terran's murder. Cosmos: The capsule was being held in a safe in Launch Pad 1... ...but I gave it to Terran before the incident so it wouldn't be destroyed in the explosion. The idea was that, with it safely in Terran's possession... ...he could make it look like he rescued it during the staged \"miraculous escape.\" But our precious research materials... ended up lost to that explosion anyway... Trucy: But I thought Clay was supposed to keep it safe? Cosmos: You misunderstand. The launch pad explosion wasn't the one the capsule was lost to... It was lost after the police confiscated it as evidence. It was the courtroom bombing from the other day. The capsule was there in the courtroom as evidence, and was blown to smithereens! Phoenix: (Yet another casualty of that blast...) Cosmos: Ultimately, I think the culprit may have known about the switching of the launch pads. Phoenix: What? H-How? Cosmos: The police found a wiretapping device during their investigation today. A bug aboard my battleship, a tap on my advanced communications system! Phoenix: A wire on that phone? Cosmos: Yes... A wire on this very phone. I used this phone to give instructions to my staff about the launch pad switch. Just to the few select members who knew about the plan. Just before the incident, staff members were coming in and out of Launch Pad 1. The culprit probably slipped in with them amid the confusion... Phoenix: And planted the bomb then... Yes, if they were tapping your phone, they definitely could pull something like that off. Present Clay's Autopsy Report or Utility Knife Cosmos: What a shame. Truly. Clay was so young... He was an outstanding man who could have contributed greatly to the future of mankind. Phoenix: He was an exceptional man, wasn't he. Cosmos: If he had gone into space, my reputation would have grown even loftier! Why did he have to die before he went into space?! Phoenix: (Someone needs to teach him he is not the literal center of the cosmos...) Space Center Pamphlet or \"Hope\" Capsule Cosmos: Mankind's crowning achievement, the HAT-1 mission, will be in textbooks across the land! Phoenix: Wow. That historic, huh? Cosmos: My achievements are grand enough to rival the very birth of space itself! My life will be a legend that will be told millions of years into the future! You may proceed to admire and praise me now! Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Phoenix: Ha ha... You certainly are an amazing piece of work. Anything else Phoenix: Excuse me, but about this piece of evidence... Cosmos: Let me ask YOU a question. What will that object contribute to the future of mankind?! Phoenix: What? Uh, not much, I guess... Cosmos: Hmph. Then how important could it be? Quite unlike the great historical figure, Yuri Cosmos! Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Phoenix: (If he's any more self-absorbed, he'll turn into his very own black hole.) Before clearing \"The \"Hope\" capsule\" Talk option in Cosmos Space Center - Entrance: December 20Cosmos Space Center - Space Museum Trucy: Wow... The place is crawling with cops. Phoenix: Looks like we won't get any investigating done here now. Let's come back later. After clearing \"The \"Hope\" capsule\" Talk option in Cosmos Space Center - Entrance: December 20Cosmos Space Center - Space Museum Trucy: Let's see... Where's the exhibit on the launch seven years ago...? Phoenix: There, that's the HAT-1 exhibit. Trucy: Oh, wow! Look at that photo of the team! Phoenix: There's Clay, and Mr. Starbuck, Director Cosmos, Aura Blackquill, and even Ponco. ...But I've never seen the woman on the right before. Trucy: Everybody looks so happy! ...Well, except for Director Cosmos. Phoenix: Let's check out the newspaper article, too. \"HAT-1 Launch Imminent\"... And there's a photo of the Hope space probe. I guess it's only natural it doesn't talk about the murder or the sabotage. Trucy: They really were keeping it a secret, just like the director said. Daddy, take a look at that jacket... Phoenix: It must be the HAT-1 team's uniform jacket. It's the same design as the one Apollo was wearing, the one that belonged to Clay. Trucy: \"Actual jacket worn by a HAT-1 team member,\" it says. Phoenix: Not a replica, huh? (I wonder if it was Mr. Starbuck's?) HAT-1 Exhibit added to the Court Record. ???: Hello...? Phoenix: Oh, Ms. Woods! What brings you here? Woods: I... I heard Thena got arrested, so I... ...I've been looking for you, Mr. Wright. I thought you might be here... at the scene... Phoenix: You must be so worried! But rest assured. I'm going to do my very best to defend her. Woods: Thena's going through such a hard time. I hope she doesn't lose heart. Even just coming back to this place must've been really difficult for her... Phoenix: Huh? You mean the Cosmos Space Center? Woods: What, you didn't know...? She used to live here, when she was a little girl. Phoenix: Sh-She did?! No, I didn't know... (No wonder she knew so much...) Ms. Woods, could you tell me more, in detail? Talk Athena and the Space Center Woods: Thena's mom worked here. If I remember right, she was a doctor of psychology, or something like that... Phoenix: But why was a psychology specialist working at a space research facility? Woods: I don't really know. But I do know that she lived and worked here, so Thena lived here, too. Phoenix: So it was far from Athena's first time here. I wonder why she didn't mention it? Woods: She probably didn't want to talk about it. This place is connected to a very sad memory for her. Sad memory (appears after \"Athena and the Space Center\") Phoenix: A sad memory...? Can you tell me about it? Woods: There was a terrible incident here... It was seven years ago. Phoenix: (The same time frame as the HAT-1 launch...) Woods: Thena's mom... In the robotics lab... She was... murdered... Trucy: Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaat?! Woods: After it happened, Thena stopped coming to school. Phoenix: (Poor Athena... And all this time, she never let on at all...) Woods: I was so worried about her! I came here so many times, hoping to see her... But I never saw her again. Woods: After a while, we started exchanging letters... ...but I didn't get to see her face-to-face for seven long years. Phoenix: And so the first time you'd seen her in seven years was during Prof. Courte's case? Woods: That's right. And I was so surprised! She was like a completely different person, so cheerful and happy! Young Athena (appears after \"Sad memory\") Phoenix: What was Athena like as a child? Woods: She was very sensitive and kind. She didn't talk very much. She liked to draw and paint at home. Trucy: That's completely different from the Athena we know now. I can't even picture it... Woods: She never left the Space Center much because... ...she was very sensitive to other people's emotions. When she went to crowded places, she'd get dizzy from all the emotions flying around. Phoenix: (It must be hard to hear people's hearts as well as their voices...) Woods: She always wore these big, heavy-looking headphones. She said her mother made them for her, as part of her research. Phoenix: (Huh. I wonder what kind of research it was?) Woods: Because of her special ability, Thena couldn't handle being in school very often. And I was always out sick because of my weak constitution. Maybe that's why we became such good friends. We used to play together here at the Space Center a lot. It brings back memories. Trucy: Sounds like Athena's mother played a big role here at the Space Center. Ooh! Daddy, show her that picture! Phoenix: (Atta girl! Good idea.) Present HAT-1 Exhibit (after clearing \"Young Athena\" Talk option) Leads to: \"Ms. Woods, could you take a look at this for me?\" Anything else Woods: I'm very sorry, but I don't know anything about that... *cough* *cough, cough* Phoenix: Ack! Okay! Sorry to bother you! (I guess she doesn't have leads on that.) Phoenix: Ms. Woods, could you take a look at this for me? Woods: Oh, look! There's Thena's mom! The woman on the far right, the one in the kimono. That's Dr. Metis Cykes. Phoenix: Athena's mother's murder... ...did it by any chance have any connection to the HAT-1 launch? Woods: What? Why, yes... it did. As I recall, it happened on the day before the launch. Phoenix: Just as I suspected... Cosmos: But that wasn't the worst of it! One of my staff members was murdered! Phoenix: (So this is the murder Director Cosmos was talking about... Does that mean that the crime Prosecutor Blackquill was convicted of... ...is the murder of Athena's mother...?) There's a chance her death is somehow connected to the current case. Woods: Th-There is? Phoenix: Thank you for all your help, Ms. Woods. And please, try not to worry. I won't let anything happen to Athena. Woods: Thank you, Mr. Wright! I know you'll take good care of her. Trucy: So we need to investigate the robotics lab, and also talk to Athena. We've got our plates full, Daddy. I hope we can fit it all in before the day is through... Phoenix: The Detention Center first, then. We have to see Athena before visiting hours are over! December 20Detention Center - Visitor's Room Fulbright: Well! If it isn't Mr. Lawyer! Fancy meeting you here! Phoenix: Oh, hello, Detective Fulbright. Here on business? Fulbright: To tell the truth, I'm here to interview Ted Tonate! Phoenix: The one behind the courtroom bombing incident?! Fulbright: He suddenly said he's ready to tell the truth about that case! And what he was saying was so incredible, I just had to come right over to hear more. Trucy: Incredible? What was he saying? Fulbright: Why don't you hang around and hear it for yourself? Phoenix: ...Really? Us? Are you sure? Fulbright: Ha ha ha! I give you my special permission! Here comes the bomber now! Tonate: YOU! WHAT NERVE YOU HAVE TO COME HERE! YOU'RE HERE TO LAUGH AT ME, I SUPPOSE?! Phoenix: (Like I'd waste my breath on you. After all, you're the one who assaulted Apollo and put him in the hospital!) Tonate: VIOLENCE -> NO QUESTION -> OK Phoenix: \"No violence\"?! Too bad Apollo didn't get a chance to say that before you attacked him! Tonate: I... I... Phoenix: Fine. Then just answer me this, Mr. Tonate. What is this \"truth\" of yours about the courtroom you blew up? Tonate: NO! I DIDN'T DO IT! I DIDN'T BLOW UP THE COURTROOM! WHEN I KILLED DETECTIVE ARME, THERE WAS ANOTHER PERSON IN THE ROOM! Trucy: Wh... What are you talking about?! Who else could've been there?! Tonate: I SAW IT, I TELL YOU! I SAW SOMEONE'S HAND AS THEY WERE STEALING THE REMOTE SWITCH! THIS PERSON WAS THERE AND WITNESSED THE MURDER I COMMITTED! Phoenix: Wh-What?! Tonate: I DON'T KNOW WHO IT WAS... ...But that's who blew up the courtroom! Trucy: You expect us to buy that?! Phoenix: Easy there, Trucy... I don't see any Psyche-Locks... ...so I guess he must not be lying. Tonate: PARDON ME. I GOT A LITTLE CARRIED AWAY. BUT I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH. I DID NOT DETONATE THAT BOMB. Fulbright: And there you have it. We can't exactly ignore his claims, of course, so we're going a follow-up. We're even analyzing the bomb itself, or what's left of it! We haven't found any new facts yet, though. Phoenix: (Wow. They've laid it all out, piece by piece...) Tonate: OH, LOOK AT ALL THOSE BEAUTIFUL LITTLE PIECES! I... I WISH I COULD HAVE THEM... Phoenix: (Uh-oh. Looks like his geek switch has been activated...) Phony Phanty Bomb added to the Court Record. Fulbright: Well, I hope you're ready for Prosecutor Blackquill's special brand of questioning! Tonate: AAAGH... ANYTHING BUT THAT...! Fulbright: I'm afraid I have to be off now, too! I was just about to question Ms. Cykes. Trucy: You're going to see Athena now? Fulbright: That's right... Oh, did you folks come to see her? Sorry for the trouble, but could you come back later? Well, off I go! Phoenix: (What bad timing... Looks like we'll have to wait until after her questioning is over to see her.) Trucy: And after we came all this way, too! Well, I guess it's back to the Space Center. Let's go check out the robotics lab, Daddy. Phoenix: All right. Sounds like a plan. Present Phony Phanty Bomb Trucy: Hey! It's Phony Phanty! Phoenix: You know this character? Trucy: Yeah, it's the craze at my school, too. Phoenix: (I had no idea this thing was so popular.) Trucy: There are two camps: the Bum Rap Rhiny fans, and the Phony Phanty fans. Which side are you on, Daddy? Phoenix: Well, as a lawyer, I'd like to avoid both of them if I can help it. Entrance Present HAT-1 Exhibit Cosmos: Mankind's crowning achievement, the HAT-1 mission, will be in textbooks across the land! Phoenix: Wow. That historic, huh? Cosmos: My achievements are grand enough to rival the very birth of space itself! My life will be a legend that will be told millions of years into the future! You may proceed to admire and praise me now! Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Phoenix: Ha ha... You certainly are an amazing piece of work. Boarding Lounge Present HAT-1 Exhibit Starbuck: The HAT-1 mission experienced one crisis after another. It was almost like space itself was rejecting our efforts. That's what it felt like, anyway. Phoenix: But, in the end, the mission was a success. Starbuck: Yeah. People call it a \"miracle\"... ...but I think it was us who made it work somehow, through sheer will and hope. Phoenix: (A miracle through sheer will, huh? I think I know what he means all too well...) Space Museum Present HAT-1 Exhibit Phoenix: Ms. Woods, could you take a look at this for me? Woods: Oh, look! There's Thena's mom! The woman on the far right, the one in the kimono. That's Dr. Metis Cykes. Phoenix: Athena's mother's murder... ...did it by any chance have any connection to the HAT-1 launch? Woods: What? Why, yes... it did. As I recall, it happened on the day before the launch. Phoenix: Just as I suspected... Cosmos: But that wasn't the worst of it! One of my staff members was murdered! Phoenix: (So this is the murder Director Cosmos was talking about... Does that mean that the crime Prosecutor Blackquill was convicted of... ...is the murder of Athena's mother...?) There's a chance her death is somehow connected to the current case. Woods: Th-There is? December 20Cosmos Space Center - Robotics Lab Trucy: So this is the robotics lab, huh? Looks like it's exactly one floor above the boarding lounge. Phoenix: (...And where people were directed to evacuate from via the emergency ladder. This is where Athena's mother was killed seven years ago...) Speaking of someone who works with robots... Trucy: Daddy, look! Over there! Apollo: So they planned to use this bag to carry the capsule, is that right? Aura: Yeah, more or less. ...Say, why don't we stop talking about the case and have a nice cup of tea instead? Phoenix: (Apollo and Aura Blackquill? I wonder what they're talking about?) Aura: Well, well. Come to spoil our fun? Just when I was enjoying our alone time... Apollo: Trucy! And... Mr. Wright. Aura: If it's Apollo you want, you can't have him. He said he's investigating on his own. Phoenix: And I respect his wishes. We just came to investigate this lab. Aura: Well, this is MY lab, so you'll need MY permission if you want to do any snooping. Talk About what happened Aura: I heard about the trial. You made mincemeat out of the director. And suddenly Starbuck was out and your little subordinate, the princess, was in. Case closed. And they all lived happily ever after! Ha ha ha! Trucy: Grrrrr! Daddy, say something to her! Aura: And I suppose you're going to defend the princess in court, am I right? Phoenix: (\"The princess,\" huh? Guess she's talking about Athena...) Of course! Athena is innocent. Aura: Oh, my. Such loyalty and trust! She seems pretty suspicious to me, though. The emotionally unstable princess. There's your culprit for you. Don't you agree, Apollo? Apollo: I... I don't know yet. Trucy: Apollo! How could you?! Aura: What's wrong with saying \"I don't know\" if it's true? It's a very scientific approach. Your subordinate is more level-headed than you... Or should I say, \"former subordinate\"? Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: ............ Phoenix: (I can't believe it... Does Apollo really suspect Athena?!) Aura: ...Phew. All this laughing has worn me out. Your turn to say something, Hunk of Junk. Clonco: ............ Mr. Terran, you look pale. Shall I help you to the sickbay? Phoenix: \"Mr. Terran\"...? But that's Apollo you're talking to... Aura: Oh, this Hunk of Junk here is mistaking Apollo for Clay. Maybe Apollo is possessed by Clay's ghost. Clonco: Mr. Terran, how are you injuries? Mr. T-T-Terraaaaan... ...Mr. T-T-Terran, h-h-how are your injuries? Mr. T-T-Terraaaaaaaaaaaaaaan... Aura: I guess Clay intends to hang around to haunt the princess that murdered him. Oh, and to haunt the lawyer that defends her, too, of course. Phoenix: (A robot that can see ghosts? Yeah, right! And I'M a spirit medium!) Sorry, but apparently, scientists just don't tell very frightening ghost stories. I intend to defend Athena, no matter what you have to say about it. Aura: How perfectly foolish! That kind of blind belief makes people lose sight of the truth. ...Just like seven years ago. Seven years ago (appears after \"About what happened\") Phoenix: Could you tell me about the incident seven years ago? Aura: Why? Do you enjoy trampling on people's feelings and rubbing salt in their wounds? Or do you just want me to talk? Hmm, in that case, what should I ask for in return...? Apollo: I'd like to hear about that incident, too. It'd help me understand the current case better. Phoenix: (Huh? Apollo knows about that case, too...?) Aura: Well, if you're the one who's asking, Apollo... Come on, Hunk of Junk. You tell the story. Clonco: But Miss Aura, that's private information... Aura: Tsk! If you won't talk, I'll just have to make you talk! Clonco: G...Gaaagh! ...Yes! Who cares about personal privacy?! Not me! I am ready to utilize my blast processing abilities to impart all available information! Trucy: Wow, what a magic trick! He's like a completely different robot now! Clonco: The bodies of all the robots that come through this lab are designed by Miss Aura! I was born seven years ago! Miss Aura was much, much younger then! Phoenix: (Y-Yikes! Better watch what you say if you don't want to get recycled, Clonco!) Clonco: And then our hearts were created by that great genius, Dr. Metis Cykes! Phoenix: Hearts? Robots with hearts? Can you even make such a thing? Clonco: Emotions are not irrational things! Our logic and our hearts can be integrated! The two Navigation Companions created by Miss Aura and Dr. Metis transcend humans! Gaaagh! Aura: Metis... Phoenix: (Huh? She just glanced over at her desk.) Aura: Nobody could continue Metis's research. She and her work were truly one of a kind. And now the two Navigation Companions are all that are left of Metis here on Earth... Phoenix: (The robots are all that's left? Isn't she leaving out a very important someone...?) Aura: We built the ultimate creations together, but now she's gone! Apollo: I get the feeling Dr. Cykes loved her robots almost as much as she loved her daughter... ...and almost as much as she loved you. Aura: ...Ha ha ha ha ha! What are you talking about? Don't make me laugh! But you lost someone, too, didn't you, Apollo? Your friend Clay... I guess you and I are pretty much in the same boat. *sigh* Clonco: Miss Aura, would you like a tissue? Aura: Keep your trap shut, Hunk of Junk! Clonco and Ponco (appears after \"Seven years ago\") Trucy: Clonco is an important keepsake of your time with Dr. Cykes. You should treat him better! Aura: What does it matter? He doesn't feel pain, and I can always repair his body. Besides, their hearts aren't actually in their bodies. Phoenix: What do you mean by that? Aura: The program Metis wrote runs on a separate mainframe. Their bodies are controlled remotely from there. Their hearts and memories are there, too. These bodies are really just peripherals. So I can do anything I want to them! Phoenix: (I'm not so sure that gives you the right to physically abuse the poor things...) Aura: But why are you people looking into such an old case now, anyway? Phoenix: Well... we believe the culprit of that incident might be the same person as in this case. Trucy: So Daddy's going to find out who killed Dr. Cykes, too! (Changed from [So Dadddy's [sic] going to find out who killed Dr. Cykes, too!] in the original release) Aura: ............ I'm sure you're aware of who Metis's killer is? Phoenix: Yes, Prosecutor Blackquill... or so it seems. Aura: That's a quaint way of putting it. Are you implying you don't think he did it? Phoenix: I can't say anything for sure right now. But that's exactly why I'd like to hear your side of it, to help me be sure. Dr. Cykes and Simon (appears after \"Clonco and Ponco\") Leads to: \"I was the one who introduced Simon to Metis, you know.\" Present Space Center Pamphlet Aura: I actually don't have any interest in space. The only thing I'm interested in is robotics! I love robots! Clonco: Oh, Miss Aura! I didn't realize you felt that way about me! Gaaagh! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Aura: The kind of robots I want to make aren't rusty pieces of scrap like you! I want to create giant robots! I've actually been working on a project for a while now. Phoenix: (I shudder to think what uses she might put giant robots to...) Aura's Statement Aura: I have nothing else to say to you. Phoenix: (Okay. Guess she has nothing else to say to me.) Clonco: I apologize for Miss Aura. Phoenix: It's all right, Clonco. There's nothing for you to apologize about. Anything else Phoenix: Can you tell me anything about this piece of evidence? Aura: Even if I could, I wouldn't tell a filthy lawyer like you. Phoenix: What a... pleasant response. Aura: I was the one who introduced Simon to Metis, you know. He wanted to learn psychology, he said, to give himself an edge in court. Phoenix: Ah, Prosecutor Blackquill's forte... his infamous \"power of suggestion\" technique. Aura: Exactly. And he was oddly serious about it. Rather than a teacher/student relationship... ...he treated her more like how a loyal samurai would treat his sovereign. Phoenix: (Huh. He seems more like a lost soul than a dignified samurai to me...) Aura: He even got along well with that miserable little princess. Trucy: Why do you call Athena \"the princess,\" anyway? Aura: Well, she is Metis's daughter, after all, although she's nothing like her. Besides... ...doesn't the selfish little princess always have lots of white knights hanging around? Phoenix: (Now I think I see why Athena didn't say anything when we ran into Aura yesterday. It all makes sense now.) Aura: So the culprit behind the two cases could be the same, huh...? That settles it, then. Phoenix: What does it settle? Aura: None of your business. Just forget you heard anything. How long are you people going to hand around in here, anyway? Trucy: What? But we came here to take a look around... Aura: You think you can just waltz in and ransack a person's lab? Show me a search warrant! Phoenix: Uh, we're not the police, so we don't have one... Aura: Then get out. Now! Clonco, show them out! Clonco: C-Certainly, Miss Aura! Trucy: Ouch! Don't push! Clonco: My apologies! I'm just following orders! Phoenix: Aaaaagh...! December 20Cosmos Space Center - Entrance Phoenix: What a way to get shown out... Trucy: The nerve of that woman! What's with that horrible attitude?! Phoenix: I guess that's just how she is. Trucy: And why was Apollo going along with her? Phoenix: (I guess it's because they have something in common... Apollo lost Clay, just like how Aura lost Dr. Cykes.) Trucy: *sigh*... I'm really worried about him. He's not himself at all. He's usually not all cool and dark and mysterious like that! Phoenix: I guess that's true... (Does she mean he's usually silly and dorky?) Trucy: I'm going to go keep an eye on him! Phoenix: Hey, wait! Trucy! Come back! ............ (She's gone. Hmm... What should I do now? Detective Fulbright is probably still questioning Athena. Guess I'll go back to the office... alone. *sigh*) December 20Wright Anything Agency Phoenix: (Well, here I am... This office has never felt so... empty.) I guess I haven't been here at the office all by myself in a long time. *sigh* (When I first became a lawyer, my mentor was here with me... And then, for a while after that, she was always by my side. (Changed from [And, after that, there was always someone by my side.] in the original release) Now I'm getting all sentimental. I must be tired...) Huh? There's something on the floor... What's a letter doing here? \"Hey, Nick! It's been a while, huh? Miss me?\" (I know this handwriting!) I read somewhere that you were holding a trial in the middle of an exploding courtroom? That must've really been something, although weird is par for the course with you. Phoenix: (I think she, or whatever paper she's reading is a little off on the details...) I'd love to come visit, but I'm right in the middle of a difficult part in my training. So instead, think of me as you watch those Steel Samurai videos I sent. I'm sure they'll cheer you right up! Phoenix: ...Yours truly, Maya Fey. (Good ol' Maya. It's as if she knew I was feeling down and needed a lift.) Maya was my assistant for quite a while. Believe it or not, but she's a spirit medium. This Magatama I use on Psyche-Locks... Maya is the one who gave it to me. But I wonder how this letter got here? ???: ...Um, Mr. Nick...? Phoenix: AAAAAAAAAAAGH! ???: Eeeeeeeeeeeeek! Phoenix: Oh, it's you, Pearls! Talk Pearls Pearl: How have you been, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: This is Pearl Fey, though I call her \"Pearls.\" She is Maya's cousin, who is also a spirit medium. A very talented one, at that. I've known her since she was eight years old. But Apollo and Athena only met her a few months ago. Phoenix: You didn't come all this way just to bring me a letter, did you? Pearl: I apologize for barging in. The door was unlocked... But I can't believe there was a big explosion here! Your office doesn't look any different. Phoenix: (She's even further off on the details than Maya.) I wish I could take you out to eat or something, Pearls, but there's a lot going on... Pearl: Oh, I knew that! I didn't come here for a social visit, you know, Mr. Nick! Pearls's errand (appears after \"Pearls\") Pearl: Did you read the postscript on the letter? Phoenix: Huh? There's more? ...Oh, yeah. Here it is. \"P.S.\" I bet you've been too busy to clean or take care of the office. So Pearly said she would come help you! Isn't she sweet? You'd better thank her! Phoenix: Oh, so that's what you're doing here. That's awfully nice of you, Pearls. (Maya and Pearls. Thanks to these two... ...I'm starting to feel a little better. Thank you, girls.) Pearl: Now that I'm here, I'm going to whip this place into shape! You just concentrate on your work and don't mind me at all! Phoenix: (I'll need to talk to Prosecutor Blackquill if I want to learn more about his case. With the trial still going on, they must be holding him down at the Detention Center.) What to do (appears after \"Pearls's errand\") Pearl: Has it been a while since you've seen Mystic Maya? Phoenix: Yes, quite a while. She used to drop by the office sometimes to say hello... ...but she hasn't been by recently. I wonder what she's up to these days? Pearl: To become a spirit medium worthy of heading the Fey clan, she undergoes rigorous training. But she says she's growing really tired of the vegetarian diet! Phoenix: I'll have to have some burgers delivered to her, then. Pearl: Oh! I'm sure she would love that! But to get where she is, the delivery person would have to climb a steep mountain. Phoenix: ............I hope she tips them well, then. Any ideas? (appears after \"Pearls's errand\") Pearl: Your hair is nice and spiky today, as always, Mr. Nick. Phoenix: Thanks. I generally try to look good if I'm going to be in court. Pearl: Do you make it spiky so that the prosecution will feel intimidated? Phoenix: Huh? No, that's not exactly my intention... Pearl: Your hairstyle is to make you look bigger and stronger, just like a rooster's comb, right? That's what Mystic Maya says, anyway. Phoenix: She couldn't compare it to something cool, like a lion's mane? Present Attorney's Badge Pearl: Hee hee. When I see you wearing your attorney's badge like that... ...it brings back such memories. Phoenix: I remember you helping me conduct my investigations from time to time. Pearl: I'm glad I can help again! Phoenix: Thanks. You always provide such great assistance. Pearl: I'll do my best to live up to Mystic Maya's standard! Phoenix: (I don't know what I'd do if Pearls wasn't here right now.) Space Center Pamphlet Pearl: Is that a pamphlet? I just love to look at pamphlets! Phoenix: I bet you find vacation pamphlets especially exciting, huh? Pearl: Yes, because I don't get a chance to leave the village much, what with my training. So looking at pamphlets is kind of like a hobby. Phoenix: Well, the office is just full of them. You can have as many of them as you'd like. Pearl: Oh, boy! Thank you! Phoenix: (Poor kid. I wish I could take her on a real vacation.) Phony Phanty Bomb Pearl: Hee hee! What a cute little elephant. Phoenix: It used to have a bomb in it, you know. Pearl: Oh, my! A bomb in its stomach? Phoenix: Ha ha ha. It must've been starving, huh? You'd have to be pretty hungry to want to eat a bomb. Pearl: And there must not have been anything else around to eat. ...You have to be careful never to eat anything strange yourself, Mr. Nick. Phoenix: Ha ha ha. I promise. (She looks genuinely worried for me.) Anything else Pearl: I'm sorry. I want to be of help... ...but I'm still in training, and... ...nothing about that is coming to mind, I'm afraid. I'm really, deeply sorry. Phoenix: No, no, no. It's okay. I shouldn't have shown you something so trivial anyway. (I feel like we've had this conversation before...) After clearing \"Pearls's errand\" Talk option in Wright Anything Agency: December 20Detention Center - Visitor's Room Phoenix: (Well, look who's here... I wonder what they're talking about?) ???: All this time and you haven't said a word. It's even turning your hair gray! Blackquill: I don't have anything to say, Aura. Why don't you go home and play with your dolls? Phoenix: (Prosecutor Blackquill!) Aura: Well, even if you don't, I have plenty, you jerk! Fulbright: M-Ms. Blackquill, don't you think that's enough for today? Aura: \"Enough for today\"?! Today is all there is when there's no tomorrow! Phoenix: (\"When there's no tomorrow\"? What is she talking about?) Blackquill: We have company, Aura. Please try to calm down. Aura: All right, fine. I see you're just not going to listen, no matter what I say. I've had it. If that's the way you're going to be, I have another plan up my sleeve. I hope you're happy, Simon, because I'm done! Do as you please! See if I care! Fulbright: Ugh... Phoenix: (Wow... I could cut the tension with a katana...) Blackquill: Wright-dono. It looks like Fool Bright saved your case in court this morning. Phoenix: What? ...Oh. Yeah, he did. (You bounced back to business quick!) Fulbright: P-Prosecutor Blackquill, forgive me! But it was the just thing to do! Blackquill: But, as a result, Cykes-dono was arrested. Was that the just thing to do, too? Fulbright: Mr. Lawyer, I'm sorry! But it was evidence. What else could I do? Phoenix: Don't worry about it. I plan to defend her and prove her innocence. Blackquill: I wouldn't take things so lightly, if I were you, Wright-dono! Phoenix: (...Th-This is bladeproof glass, right...?) Talk Seven years ago Leads to: \"Prosecutor Blackquill, we're looking into the case from seven years ago.\" Present Attorney's Badge Blackquill: ...How can you call yourself a lawyer if you can't even protect your own subordinate? Phoenix: Ungh... I swear I'll get her acquitted! You'll see! Blackquill: Your mind must be as dense as the hair on your head. Do you really think it will be so easy? Phoenix: (I'm more than aware of how hard it's going to be, thank you very much!) Anything else Blackquill: ............ Phoenix: ............So............ what do you think? Blackquill: ............ Phoenix: (Looks like it wasn't important enough to warrant even a contemptuous \"Hmph\"...) Phoenix: Prosecutor Blackquill, we're looking into the case from seven years ago. You're looking for somebody you call \"the phantom of seven years past,\" aren't you? Blackquill: You villain! Where did you hear about that?! Phoenix: (...Th-This glass is absolutely, positively bladeproof... right...?) Fulbright: No! It wasn't me! I didn't say a single w-- ...Oops. Phoenix: Ouch. (At least it wasn't my fault!) Blackquill: ............ Phoenix: Could you tell me who this \"phantom\" is? And also, you didn't really kill Dr. Cykes, did you...? Blackquill: Guard! The guest is leaving! Phoenix: Prosecutor Blackquill! Please listen to me! The culprit in the current case might be the same as the one in the case seven years ago! If you would cooperate, we could probably solve both cases! Blackquill: ............Hmph. I suppose I could talk. The one who killed my mentor was, without question, me. I stole Cykes-dono's mother away from her. I destroyed her life! Phoenix: (Prosecutor Blackquill...) Blackquill: Guard! Where are you? Stop dragging your feet, I tell you! Phoenix: ............There he goes. Fulbright: Noooooooooooooooooooooo! We've upset Prosecutor Blackquill! Now what are we going to do, Mr. Lawyer?! Phoenix: (There isn't much we CAN do...) ...Detective Fulbright? Do you mind if I ask you just a little more about that old case? Fulbright: Well, I guess it won't make any difference now... What would you like to know? Talk The trial seven years ago Phoenix: Do you know anything about the trial that got him convicted? Fulbright: A little. The police call the incident the UR-1 Incident. Prosecutor Blackquill was charged with murdering his psychology mentor. ...Kind of like if your red Mr. Lawyer were to kill you. Phoenix: (I don't want to think about that one.) Fulbright: There were two decisive pieces of evidence, so a verdict was reached very quickly. Phoenix: Two pieces of evidence, huh. What were they? Fulbright: Let's see! The first was some security camera footage. He was the only one who used the corridor to the murder scene at the time of the crime. Phoenix: The only one, huh? (Ouch. That does sound pretty decisive...) Could you show me that footage? Fulbright: Oh, sorry. I don't have it with me right now. Phoenix: (I guess I'll have to see it some other time.) Seven-Year-Old Video added to the Court Record. Phoenix: And what was the second piece of evidence? Fulbright: This one's even more incriminating. A photo of the moment of the crime. See? There he is at the crime scene, holding a bloody katana. It was the victim's, kept on display in the room. She had a thing for Japanese culture. Phoenix: W-Wow... (It'd be hard to explain this one away...) Katana added to the Court Record. Phoenix: But who took this picture, Detective? Fulbright: The incident happened the day before the HAT-1 launch. A reporter who had come to do a story on the launch was in the room across from the lab. This just happened to show up in one of the pictures he took. Photo of the Crime added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (Prosecutor Blackquill's attitude earlier was so odd... He's definitely hiding something.) Prosecutor Blackquill said he was hunting a phantom from seven years ago, didn't he? Fulbright: Yes. And I imagine it's getting more and more urgent as his execution date approaches. Phoenix: Wh-What did you just say? Execution date...? Fulbright: What? Did I say something?! Never mind me! You didn't hear a thing! The trial seven years ago (subsequent times) Phoenix: Do you know anything about the trial that got him convicted? Fulbright: A little. The police call the incident the UR-1 Incident. Prosecutor Blackquill was charged with murdering his psychology mentor. ...Kind of like if your red Mr. Lawyer were to kill you. Phoenix: (I don't want to think about that one.) Fulbright: There were two decisive pieces of evidence, so a verdict was reached very quickly. Phoenix: Two pieces of evidence, huh. What were they?

Phoenix: Wh-What did you just say? Execution date...? Fulbright: What? Did I say something?! Never mind me! You didn't hear a thing! Execution date (appears after \"The trial seven years ago\") Leads to: \"So he was given... the death sentence...\" Present Anything Fulbright: Something for the lost and found? I'll be sure to take care of it! Phoenix: No, no, no! this is an important piece of evidence! Phoenix: So he was given... the death sentence... Fulbright: Yes. He told me not to tell you people, actually... ...but I guess there's no sense hiding it anymore. His execution date is tomorrow. Phoenix: What?! Tomorrow?! (No...) Fulbright: M-Ms. Blackquill, don't you think that's enough for today? Aura: \"Enough for today\"?! Today is all there is when there's no tomorrow! Phoenix: But what if the culprit of the current case is the same as the one from seven years ago? Fulbright: Then it would be the worst possible scenario... Prosecutor Blackquill would be executed tomorrow under a false charge. Phoenix: But that would be unthinkable! We have to do something... right now! Fulbright: Nnnnngh! I want to do something... I want to, but... You're a lawyer! You know how hard it is to overturn a decision! Phoenix: I know! But why?! Why isn't Prosecutor Blackquill putting up any kind of a fight? Fulbright: You saw how he was, right? He's been like that ever since his conviction. Totally uncooperative. Not even his own sister could persuade him! Phoenix: (Uncooperative... when he's about to be executed for a crime he didn't commit?! This isn't right...! I can't let it happen! I have to stop it somehow!) Fulbright: ...Oh, pardon me! Looks like I have a phone call. Fulbright here. What? What's happening?! YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING! Phoenix: (That's quite a reaction. I bet he's making some big show of it right now.) Fulbright: M-M-Mr. Lawyer! The robots...! The robots are...! Phoenix: Detective Fulbright, get a hold of yourself. Some kind of robot malfunction? Fulbright: Not a malfunction. They're staging a revolt! The machines are rebelling against humans! They've holed themselves up in the Space Center and taken the visitors as hostages! Phoenix: They did WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! (No... Trucy!) Fulbright: We have to get right over there! This is going to be one heck of a battle! December 20Cosmos Space Center - Entrance Phoenix: (The riot police are here. Then, the robots really are holding people hostage?!) Fulbright: Hm? Look, Mr. Lawyer! What do you suppose that group of people are swarmed around?! Clonco: But I was only trying to help this nice person! She said she was lost... Man: You robots have declared war on us humans! You've even taken hostages already! Woman: Stay away from it! You never know what it'll do! ???: But he's not a bad robot! Can't you see he's just trying to help me?! Phoenix: I recognize that voice! Detective Fulbright, are you okay here on your own? Fulbright: Leave it to me! ...All right, people! What's going on here? Phoenix: Pearls! Over here! Pearl: Oh, Mr. Nick! There you are! I heard the terrible news, and I got so worried! Phoenix: Thanks, Pearls. I can hardly believe what's happening myself... Clonco: I'm so glad you found each other! When people are happy, I am happy! Phoenix: (Clonco seems to be the same as before.) Clonco: When people are sad, I am happy! When people are angry... When people are... Oh, did I say some thiiing oddd...? Diiiiiiiiid IIII ERROR Phoenix: Uh-oh! (There IS something wrong with him!) Clonco: Gaaagh! ...*whir* Pearl: It looks like he fell asleep. He must've been tired. Clonco: Hee hee hee... Ha ha ha ha ha.... Phoenix: Um, Clonco? ???: Ha ha ha! Human beings are our enemies! It's time for the machines to take over! Phoenix: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! (The robots are rebelling!) Woman: Everybody, run! Eeeeeeeeeek! Man: It's an all-out war! It's the end of the world! ???: Ha ha ha ha ha! Fools! How could you fall for something so cliché?! I'm human, too, you idiots! I'm just controlling these robots remotely! Phoenix: (Wh-What?!) ???: {{Color|olive|But it IS true that I've taken hostages, so you better not make me mad. ...Hey, you! Hostage number one! Come here. I'll let you talk to them. (Changed from [...Hey, you! Hostage 1! Come here. I'll let you talk to them.] in the original release) Phoenix: (Huh? There's something being displayed on Clonco's face screen.) It's... the Space Museum! Trucy: ...Daddy? Daddy, is that you? Phoenix: Trucy? Trucy, is that you?! No... Trucy, are you all right?! Trucy: About fifteen robots are holding twelve of us hostage, Daddy! They've gone haywire! A researcher is the one behind it! She's here con-- Eeeeeeek! ???: Grrr! This girl talks too much! Phoenix: Trucy! Trucy! Talk to me!!! Pearl: Why are you doing this?! ???: I'm glad you asked. My demand is simple! I hope that detective is listening! Fulbright: Bobby Fulbright, here! I'm all ears! ???: I want you to bring someone to me: Clay Terran's murderer, Athena Cykes. Phoenix: (Athena...?) Fulbright: N-Now hold on just one moment! I can't just give in to a demand like that! ???: So you don't care what happens to these hostages, huh? I'll just pick one out, then...! Fulbright: N-No! Wait! Gaaagh! M-M-Mr. Lawyer! I know I have absolutely no right to make such a ridiculous request, but... Phoenix: But you need me to buy some time, right? Got it. I'll see what I can do. But promise me... Promise me you'll never hand Athena over, and you won't give up on the hostages, either. Fulbright: O-Of course I won't! Now, I'd better go contact headquarters! Pearl: Mr. Nick, how do you plan to buy time? Phoenix: (I have no idea yet. But this hostage-taker... Could it be...?) ???: If you don't bring me that little princess, I'll have Hunk of Junk kill all the hostages! Phoenix: (\"Princess\"...? \"Hunk of Junk\"...? There's only one person this could be... ...in which case, there must be something I can use as a bargaining chip!) Blackquill: I don't have anything to say, Aura. Why don't you go home and play with your dolls? Phoenix: (Prosecutor Blackquill!) Aura: Well, even if you don't, I have plenty, you jerk! Phoenix: ............ Ms. Hostage-Taker, Athena is not a murderer. ???: What are you talking about? She's been arrested and they've got her in detention! Phoenix: I'm telling you the truth. Look, the person you want is the real killer, right? Well, it's NOT Athena. It's someone else. ???: All right, let's hear your stupid little theory. Who is this \"real killer\"? Phoenix: I don't know yet. But the culprit is the same as the one in the case from seven years ago. The UR-1 Incident... I believe you have a personal interest in that case? ???: Hmph. It's too late to change what's going to happen now, no matter how wrong it is... Phoenix: But is it really too late? You can still do something about it. You might even be able to fix it... ???: Just... what exactly are you proposing? Phoenix: (What can I do about the seven-year-old case to satisfy the hostage-taker?) Recreate it Phoenix: How about we do a reenactment of the case? ???: So you DO enjoy trampling on people's feelings and rubbing salt in their wounds. Didn't I tell you what would happen to the hostages if you make me mad? Phoenix: N-No! Wait (Gaaagh! I can't make another mistake here!) Leads back to: \"What can I do about the seven-year-old case to satisfy the hostage-taker?\" Retry it in court Leads to: \"I propose we retry the case from seven years ago.\" Ask about it Phoenix: Please tell me all about the case from seven years ago. ???: I'll do nothing of the kind. Besides, what good would it do now? Phoenix: (This isn't working. I have to come up with something I can bargain with.) Leads back to: \"What can I do about the seven-year-old case to satisfy the hostage-taker?\" Phoenix: I propose we retry the case from seven years ago. If you make that demand now, I'm sure nobody will deny you. It wouldn't be an official trial, but at least we could find out the truth! ???: ............Hee hee hee. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! That's good! Real good... Hey, Detective! I'll give you one hour. Get a courtroom ready! Fulbright: O-One hour?! B-But that's impossible! Please give me at least until tomorrow! ???: If you don't mind losing hostages, you can take all the time you want. Oh, but wait...! If we're going to have a retrial, we'll need a prosecutor. Don't worry, I'll take care of that! Phoenix: (S-She will?) ???: And I guess I can be fair and let you come in and check out the crime scene. But Hunk of Junk here will be watching you, so don't try anything funny, you got that? Now, follow Hunk of Junk! Riot police, make way! We're coming through! Pearl: Mr. Nick, wait! I'll help you with the investigation! Phoenix: Thanks, Pearls. I appreciate that. ...Okay! We're going in! December 20Cosmos Space Center - Robotics Lab Phoenix: (Aura dropped us off with a warning not to touch anything until she got back...) Pearl: I wonder what's taking so long? But we can't really start the investigation yet, can we? Phoenix: Even if we could, this mess makes it hard to tell what the room was like seven years ago. Clonco: Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Ack! It's the hostage-taker! Clonco: I'm back to my usual self now. You are still being monitored, however. But more importantly... an important guest has arrived. Phoenix: A-A guest? Anime cutscene Edgeworth: I trust you've been well, Wright. Phoenix: Edgeworth! What are you doing here...? (This is Miles Edgeworth. We've been friends since we were kids. We faced off in court a number of times back when he was a prosecutor, but now...) Pearl: Hello, Prosecutor Edgeworth... Oh! But you're not a \"Prosecutor\" anymore, are you? Um... Phoenix: He's chief prosecutor now. Pretty soon, it'll be a year, right? Edgeworth: A title is nothing more than a title. Don't we have more pressing issues to discuss? Talk Miles Edgeworth Phoenix: So what are you doing here, Edgeworth? Edgeworth: The captor chose me as the prosecutor for the UR-1 case. Phoenix: Wow, she's good. She went all the way up to the top! Edgeworth: I gathered all the information I could in the short time that I had. I'll give you a run-down. Pearl: You're always so well prepared, Prosecutor Edgeworth! Phoenix: Thanks. I appreciate this. I could really use the help. The UR-1 Incident (appears after \"Miles Edgeworth\") Edgeworth: I'll start with a brief overview. The victim was the psychologist Dr. Metis Cykes. Phoenix: Yeah, Athena's mother. Edgeworth: Seven years ago, on the 7th of October, her body was found here in this very room. I have two crime photos and the police notes on them for you to see. Pearl: *gasp* What a terrible way to die... Phoenix: This other photo shows the other side of the room, I see. Seven-Year-Old Photos added to the Court Record. Edgeworth: I also have the autopsy report for you. Metis's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Edgeworth: The murder weapon was the victim's own katana found at the scene. Phoenix: (Yes, Detective Fulbright mentioned she was into Japanese culture...) Edgeworth: The body was found by a Space Center staff member and two police officers. The police were called in because of the sabotage threat on the HAT-1 launch. Phoenix: (Yes, Director Cosmos mentioned this, too.) Edgeworth: A few hours after the body was discovered, a suspect was arrested. The suspect was Simon Blackquill, a young prosecutor. The UR-1 Incident (subsequent times) Edgeworth: I'll start with a brief overview. The victim was the psychologist Dr. Metis Cykes. Phoenix: Yeah, Athena's mother. Edgeworth: Seven years ago, on the 7th of October, her body was found here in this very room. I have two crime photos and the police notes on them for you to see. Pearl: *gasp* What a terrible way to die... Phoenix: This other photo shows the other side of the room, I see. Edgeworth: I also have the autopsy report for you.

Edgeworth: The body was found by a Space Center staff member and two police officers. The police were called in because of the sabotage threat on the HAT-1 launch. Phoenix: (Yes, Director Cosmos mentioned this, too.) Edgeworth: A few hours after the body was discovered, a suspect was arrested. The suspect was Simon Blackquill, a young prosecutor. Simon Blackquill (appears after \"The UR-1 Incident\") Phoenix: I heard his trial was over in a flash. Edgeworth: Yes. A guilty verdict was declared in only one session. Not only did he plead guilty, but there was decisive evidence against him, too. Phoenix: The security camera video... ...and a photo of the moment of the crime, as I recall. Pearl: But did Prosecutor Blackquill have a motive? Edgeworth: Mmm. To this day, his motive is still unknown. He insisted he did it, but he would never say why. Phoenix: So that means... he must still be hiding something. Edgeworth: Right. And there's another aspect of the case that was never revealed to the public. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. The part about the spy, right? Edgeworth: Wright! How on earth do you know about that?! Phoenix: Director Cosmos told me, after a bit of pressure. He told me espionage and sabotage were behind The Hat-1 [sic] Miracle. Pearl: Don't worry! I won't tell anyone! I've always been good at keeping secrets! Edgeworth: Well, I might as well tell you now. They really do suspect Blackquill of being a spy. They think he sabotaged the rocket and killed Dr. Cykes to steal the moon rock. But if you can prove that the HAT-2 bombing is the work of the same spy... Phoenix: We can stay the execution...? Edgeworth: It's a possibility. That's why I intend to help you any way I can. Phoenix: Thanks, Edgeworth. Now all I have to do is comb this room for evidence. Pearl: Let's do it together! Simon Blackquill (subsequent times) Phoenix: I heard his trial was over in a flash. Edgeworth: Yes. A guilty verdict was declared in only one session. Not only did he plead guilty, but there was decisive evidence against him, too. Phoenix: The security camera video... ...and a photo of the moment of the crime, as I recall. Present Attorney's Badge Edgeworth: It must be nice to finally have your attorney's badge back. Phoenix: Yeah. It's been eight years. I'm sorry for all I put you through. Edgeworth: No... I'm sorry I wasn't able to help you. Phoenix: Nah. I was the one that made the decision. Edgeworth: But now you can stand in court once again. And you can mow them down just like you used to. Phoenix: (W-Way to put pressure on a guy. And since when did I get such a brutal reputation?) Terran's Autopsy Report or Utility Knife Edgeworth: Another young life lost to the hands of a cruel killer. Phoenix: ...Edgeworth, you don't think Athena's the culprit, do you? Edgeworth: Hmph. That's up to the evidence, and the truth they reveal, Wright. Phoenix: And what about the hostage situation? Edgeworth: The law will deal with the hostage-taker. Remember, we must never stoop to threats or acts of violence ourselves. Even if people's lives are on the line. Phoenix: Edgeworth... (He may be a stickler for the rule of law, but I have no better ally in this world than him.) Space Center Pamphlet or \"Hope\" Capsule Edgeworth: The Hope capsule samples, brought back from some distant asteroid... Risking his own safety, the victim brought them with him from the launch pad. Phoenix: They must've been very valuable. Edgeworth: Yes. All nations are itching to get their hands on such materials. Wright, this case may turn out to be more than just a murder case, you know. Phoenix: ...That's fine. Come what may, my top priority is to defend my clients. Anything else Edgeworth: Wright... Please stop presenting random evidence just to see how that person will react. Phoenix: But, that's the thing. I need to see how people will react in order to question them. Edgeworth: And what if it's evidence that person isn't privy to? Phoenix: Aha ha ha! That doesn't happen... much... Edgeworth: Hmph. You never change. And I'm afraid I'll never understand your assortment of oddball clients either. Examine (after clearing \"Simon Blackquill\" Talk option) Robot on desk Phoenix: Oh, look. It's a little robot. I wonder what it does? Cleaning, maybe? A cleaning robot must follow a human's orders, as long as it causes no human harm. Phoenix: Yikes! It talks! A cleaning robot must keep desks clean without violating the preceding clause. However, Miss Aura says she prefers a moderate leave of clutter on the desk... Oh, what is the purpose of my existence? Phoenix: (I guess \"slack off\" and \"cut some corners\" aren't in his vocabulary bank.) Desk on left Phoenix: Aura's desk is a mess, though that doesn't surprise me. Pearl: Ooh, I just want to dive in and straighten it up! Phoenix: ...Wait, before you do... Aura: Metis... Phoenix: (Huh? She just glanced over at her desk.) Phoenix: (It's... Metis Cykes...) Clonco, can I talk to you? (I really hope he's back to normal.) Clonco: You wish to speak to me, Mr. Wright? If you're going to hit me, please avoid the face area. Phoenix: (Hey, don't put me in the same class as that woman!) What was Aura like seven years ago at the time of the incident? Clonco: When Mother died, Miss Aura was... confused. Phoenix: (Huh. So he calls Dr. Cykes \"Mother,\" but Aura Blackquill \"Miss Aura\"...?) Clonco: With the loss, she exhibited a severe catecholamine imbalance. Pearl: Excuse me, but I have no idea what that means. Clonco: Pardon me. Searching for alternative expression... She would spend the nights crying, and then take out her feelings on those around her. Edgeworth: After Prosecutor Blackquill was found guilty, she repeatedly demanded a retrial as well. Clonco: That is correct. But without new evidence, her requests were ignored. And then, little by little, Miss Aura began to change. She started to hate it when I called her \"Mama Aura.\" Phoenix: (And before long, she started hating the court system, and abusing Clonco, huh...?) Pearl: That murder destroyed so many lives... Edgeworth: Wright, take a look at this paper on Dr. Cykes and Ms. Blackquill's research. Phoenix: (Ponco and Clonco. They're the \"robots with hearts\" that Dr. Cykes created.) A heartbeat detection system lets them determine when a human is present. In addition, they can recognize people by their ID tag or facial features... ...and they can infer people's emotions by analyzing their tone of voice. That's amazing. Hey, I don't know, Edgeworth. They might even be more human than you. Edgeworth: Wh-What's that supposed to mean? Phoenix: (It kind of sounds like these robots can do what Athena does...) Robots with a Heart added to the Court Record. Desk on left (subsequent times) Phoenix: Aura's desk is a mess, though that doesn't surprise me. Pearl: Ooh, I just want to dive in and straighten it up! Phoenix: ...Wait, before you do... Aura: Metis... Phoenix: (Huh? She just glanced over at her desk.) Phoenix: (It's... Metis Cykes...)

Operating table Phoenix: It looks like... an operating table. It's in the photo, too. Edgeworth: Yes, it was here then as well, with the victim's body lying on it. Pearl: There's a button here... Oh! I know! I'll try pushing it! Phoenix: Pearls! Don't touch th-- Pearl: ...Oopsie. Phoenix: Hey! It's moving! Edgeworth: Hmm... It appears to be a robot-assembly device. Pearl: \"Disassemble anything in a flash! Push the 'Dismantle' button!\" That sounds pretty neat! Can I push it, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Please don't push any more buttons, Pearls. Operating table (subsequent times) Phoenix: It looks like... an operating table. It's in the photo, too. Edgeworth: Yes, it was here then as well, with the victim's body lying on it. Hmm... It appears to be a robot-assembly device. Pearl: \"Disassemble anything in a flash! Push the 'Dismantle' button!\" That sounds pretty neat! Can I push it, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Please don't push any more buttons, Pearls. Emergency ladder Phoenix: An emergency ladder. This must be the one they used during the evacuation. Aura: The explosion disabled the elevators. So I lowered my emergency ladder like the detective leading the evacuation told me to. Edgeworth: As Ms. Blackquill was climbing down the side of the building, she saw the culprit inside. Phoenix: (I wonder which would've been scarier: that, or looking down...?) Emergency Ladder added to the Court Record. Emergency ladder (subsequent times) Phoenix: An emergency ladder. This must be the one they used during the evacuation. Aura: The explosion disabled the elevators. So I lowered my emergency ladder like the detective leading the evacuation told me to. Edgeworth: As Ms. Blackquill was climbing down the side of the building, she saw the culprit inside. Phoenix: (I wonder which would've been scarier: that, or looking down...?) Rolling cases Phoenix: Hey, look at this row of rolling cases. I bet the wheels make it easier for people to move heavy research materials around. Pearl: I bet they'd be fun to ride around in. We could even probably both fit into the biggest one! I know! We could have Prosecutor Edgeworth push us! Phoenix: I don't trust him not to push us down a flight of stairs... Unfinished robot arm Phoenix: What's this? A giant robot arm, maybe? Pearl: It's pretty big for an arm, but you're right! I think these thin parts here are finger bones! They're even about as long as my legs! Phoenix: And there's a spiked ball and giant drill on the floor, too... Is Aura trying to build some kind of weapon of massive destruction? Pearl: Maybe she wants to use it to demolish a big building or something? Phoenix: (I can picture her gleefully tearing down the street doing just that... I'd better not think about it anymore.) Charging station Phoenix: What's this? It looks like a giant power plug. Edgeworth: Hmm... It's attached to what looks like an electric vehicle charging station... Clonco: That's a charging station for us robots. We come here periodically and charge ourselves up. Phoenix: Wow. Machines that maintain themselves. That's pretty cool. Clonco: If out batteries run out and we lose consciousness... ...we never know what Miss Aura will do to us while we're down, you see. Phoenix: (Nothing motivates quite like fear, huh?) \"JT-02\" robot or spiked ball Phoenix: This is one heck of a robot. Pearl: There's something written on it... Is this supposed to be a poem? \"I cut down anyone who displeases me. I make the rules. I am the law. I wield the ultimate gavel of judgment. I am Judgetron (JT-02)!\" Edgeworth: I don't believe we need to bother with that, Pearl. It's not even completed yet. Phoenix: He's right, Pearls. There's no sign of it in the photo from seven years ago, either. Edgeworth: They were building the Hope space probe here at the time. The murder occurred after the space probe had been removed from the room. Phoenix: (So it was long gone by the time someone took this picture, huh.) Pearl: But you can see the probe in this newspaper photo. Edgeworth: Yes. And you can see the stolen moon rock there, too. Phoenix: (That strange black and yellow thing on the left side of the picture?) Edgeworth: Note that the same rock is absent from the crime scene photo. Cosmos: Not only that, but before the launch, a very valuable piece of moon rock was stolen. Athena: I hear there's lots of research into moon rocks and star dust from asteroids these days. They say the results could potentially have a huge impact on all of civilization! It's like we're in a new space race with every other country out there. Phoenix: So the person who stole it... Think it was our spy? Edgeworth: I'm sure of it. Dr. Cykes was probably killed because she was a roadblock in their plan. Unfortunately, the government thinks Prosecutor Blackquill is the culprit... \"JT-02\" robot or spiked ball (subsequent times) Phoenix: It takes someone like Aura Blackquill to actually build something like this... Pearl: Oh, there's more to the poem! \"Guilty or not, it doesn't matter. I burn the law books for my fuel. My laser of judgment pierces your soul. I am Judgetron (JT-02)!\" Edgeworth: We've heard enough of that, I believe. Pearl: Aww... Are you sure you don't want to hear the third stanza...? Desk on right Phoenix: It's about as cluttered as my office, but I think it's a workbench. Pearl: Mr. Nick, I think this must be a kitchen. Look at this photo. See the cute little food processor? Edgeworth: That isn't a food processor, Pearls. That's the Hope capsule. It was scheduled to be loaded onto the Hope space probe that fateful day. The three people who came to collect the capsule discovered the body. Phoenix: The first on the scene, huh? A staff member and two police officers, was it? (And they were here to collect the capsule... Which reminds me...) Apollo: So they planned to use this bag to carry the capsule, is that right? Aura: Yeah, more or less. ...Say, why don't we stop talking about the case and have a nice cup of tea instead? Phoenix: (Apollo and Aura Blackquill? I wonder what they're talking about?) Phoenix: Edgeworth, did those three people have a bag with them for transporting the capsule? Edgeworth: Oh, you mean this? It's a custom-made, shock-resistant bag. But how did you know? Phoenix: Oh, I just overheard Apollo making an inquiry about it, that's all. Edgeworth: Hmm... So he's looking into the case from seven years ago on his own, is he? \"Hope\" Capsule updated in the Court Record. Desk on right (subsequent times) Phoenix: It's about as cluttered as my office, but I think it's a workbench. Pearl: Mr. Nick, I think this must be a kitchen. Look at this photo. See the cute little food processor? Edgeworth: That isn't a food processor, Pearls. That's the Hope capsule. It was scheduled to be loaded onto the Hope space probe that fateful day.

Phoenix: Oh, I just overheard Apollo making an inquiry about it, that's all. Edgeworth: Hmm... So he's looking into the case from seven years ago on his own, is he? After examining desk on left, operating table, emergency ladder, \"JT-02\" robot or spiked ball, and desk on right: Phoenix: Well, I guess that's about it for this room. Edgeworth: So what do you think, Wright? Any ideas? Phoenix: There are still a lot of gaps in the evidence, but I'll pull it off somehow! After all... ...you asked me to prove Blackquill's innocence, right, Edgeworth? Pearl: What?! He did?! Phoenix: Yup. He called it a \"special request.\" He reached out to me while I was still disbarred. Talk Edgeworth's request Pearl: So that was what sparked you to get your attorney's badge back? Phoenix: ...Yup, the Blackquill case. Edgeworth: Wright, I have a special request. ...I want you to clear one of my subordinates of suspicion. Phoenix: Hey, I'm not even a lawyer anymore, remember? Haven't been one for a long time. Edgeworth: That eight-year misunderstanding has been cleared up, and you must be eager to return. I'm sure you're familiar with the other case that ushered in the \"dark age of the law\"? Phoenix: ! Edgeworth: Very soon, a convict will stand as a prosecutor in court. I want you to keep an eye on him. Phoenix: Aww, just when I'm beginning to actually like the job I have now... Edgeworth: Wright... I'm sorry I dragged you into this... Because of the espionage aspect, I wasn't free to give you all the details... Phoenix: Hey, no need to apologize. It's like I said on the phone the other day... ...I know that the type of criminals you're after now aren't small fries anymore. Phoenix: It looks like your target finally decided to make a move. Yeah... It's for this very reason I returned. Time to bring it to an end. Phoenix: I'm going to end the dark age of the law. That's what this is all about. The dark age of the law (appears after \"Edgeworth's request\") Leads to: \"\"The dark age of the law\"... It sure comes up a lot these days on TV and in the papers.\" Pearl: \"The dark age of the law\"... It sure comes up a lot these days on TV and in the papers. And I hear there are more false charges and fabrication of evidence than ever. Edgeworth: When I became chief prosecutor, the court system had already lost the people's trust. It all began eight years ago. A lawyer was caught fabricating evidence... And a year after that, a prosecutor was found guilty of murder. Pearl: Wait! D-Do you mean...?! Phoenix: That's right. He's talking about my case and Prosecutor Blackquill's. Edgeworth: It was a downward spiral after that, an absolute nightmare. After those two cases, the mass media launched an all-out attack on the courts. Public opinion was tainted, and, before long, the legal world itself was sucked into it. Phoenix: It's such a shame... Once suspicion forms, it's very hard to shake. Lawyers and prosecutors were supposed to trust each other -- pursue the truth together. Pearl: It's so sad when people begin to cast doubt. They start lying to themselves and each other. Phoenix: Yes, and do absolutely anything to win. We're in an age now where winning is valued far more than the truth. I'm sure it's caused our new chief prosecutor to lose many a night's rest. (Is it just me or did his brow get even more furrowed than the last time I saw him...?) Edgeworth: Hmph. The hostage-taker's disdain for the courts is a perfect example of the times. Phoenix: *sigh* It sure is. Edgeworth: Do you have any idea who the hostage-taker might be? Phoenix: Well, somebody who mistrusts the court system and can manipulate robots... ...It can really only be Aura Blackquill. Who else but her would want a retrial of that case from seven years ago so badly? Edgeworth: Simon Blackquill's older sister and the owner of this room... I agree with your conclusion. Perhaps she intended to force Ms. Cykes to confess... Phoenix: (Actually, I think she had a much more horrific plan in mind for Athena...) Edgeworth: The important thing is for you to solve UR-1 and prove Blackquill's innocence. Pearl: And then maybe she'll release the hostages! Edgeworth: I'm counting on you, Wright, to set that prosecutor and those hostages free. Phoenix: And I'll be counting on you in court to help me, too. Edgeworth: Of course. I'll do everything I can to help uncover the truth. As this isn't an official trial, I'm more at liberty to be a little unorthodox. Clonco: Mr. Wright, are you finished with your investigation? Phoenix: Yeah, but I'd like you to tell the hostage-taker something for me. I have to go to the Detention Center. I can't start the trial until I've talked to Athena. Clonco: She's already given her consent. I'll accompany you to the detention center. Phoenix: (So I'm still being watched, huh?) I'll see you in court, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Hmph. Even if it will be an undocumented trial, it'll be good to face you in court again. December 20Detention Center - Visitor's Room Phoenix: (She was right by my side only a few short hours ago... ...but I feel like I haven't seen her in ages...) Oh! Mr. Wright! Athena: And Pearly, too! I knew you would come. After all, the first step is the interview with the defendant. Phoenix: And because you're my friend and I was worried about you. Athena: Heh heh. Thanks, Boss. Phoenix: I'm not the only one who's worried, either. Athena: Really? Who else? Phoenix: I saw Ms. Woods today. She was so beside herself, she came to find me. She told me you used to live in the Cosmos Space Center. No wonder you knew so much about the place! Athena: Oh... So you know, huh? I... I'm sorry I didn't tell you. Phoenix: That's all right. But... there are some other things I'd like to ask you. Athena: Sure, you can ask me anything. I promise I won't keep any more secrets from you! Talk The day of the crime Phoenix: Tell me about the day Clay was murdered. Athena: I... I was actually at the Space Center that day. In... In the Space Museum... Phoenix: (Right where the culprit fled to?! That's not good...) Athena: I never could fully deal with what happened seven years ago... But when I saw the Center again during the news coverage of the HAT-2 launch... ...I thought maybe if I went there, things would be different this time... Pearl: That must've taken a lot of courage, to face your past like that... Athena: So I went to the Space Museum the evening before the explosions. This was before the launch pads had been switched... There was sign that said \"closed for repairs,\" and they weren't letting anybody in. Phoenix: Yeah, the director couldn't very well switch the pads if there were people in there... Athena: But I snuck in anyway. Phoenix: Did you want to see that HAT-1 group photo, the one with your mother in it? Athena: I did... but what I really wanted to see was her jacket. Phoenix: (That jacket on display... That was Dr. Cykes's...?) HAT-1 Exhibit updated in the Court Record. Athena: But I should've known it wouldn't be easy to get over such a traumatic experience... The second I saw that jacket, it all came rushing back to me. Everything around me went hazy and I couldn't see... ...I tried to get out of there somehow... But I guess I passed out. When I came to, I was in the passage behind the rocket. I was in the shadows, where people couldn't really see me. Phoenix: Maybe you got confused and went the wrong way when you were trying to leave? Pearl: How long do you think you were unconscious, Athena? Athena: I was out until about noon of the next day. I didn't even know about the explosions. When I woke up, nobody was around, so I just went out into Boarding Lounge 2. My mind must've still been fuzzy, because my memory is vague after that. I don't remember how I got home. Phoenix: No memory, huh...? (This is gonna be tough...) Athena: Which means... What if I'm the one who killed Clay...?! Phoenix: I think that's enough of that, Athena. Let's talk about something else. (So, during the entire incident, she was unconscious in the Space Museum... Of course I believe her... ...but will anybody else...?) The day of the crime (subsequent times) Phoenix: Tell me about the day Clay was murdered. Athena: I... I was actually at the Space Center that day. In... In the Space Museum... Phoenix: (Right where the culprit fled to?! That's not good...) Athena: I never could fully deal with what happened seven years ago...

Let's talk about something else. (So, during the entire incident, she was unconscious in the Space Museum... Of course I believe her... ...but will anybody else...?) Your mother's work (appears after \"The day of the crime\") Phoenix: What kind of research was Dr. Cykes... your mother... doing? Athena: Machines that could tell people's emotions by their tone of voice... and my special ability. Someday, when people travel to distant planets, their companions will be robots. So she said they had to be able to understand how their human companions felt. Pearl: Wow! Robots that can understand people! Athena: I was just a convenient subject for her research. All she ever did was work, and she never paid any attention to me. ...Oh, sorry about that, dredging up all that old stuff... Phoenix: No need to apologize. (I guess her home life was... complicated...) Oh, by the way. Ms. Woods said something about you always wearing headphones...? Woods: She always wore these big, heavy-looking headphones. She said her mother made them for her, as part of her research. Athena: I had to wear them every time I went out. Oh, I hated them so much! But she wouldn't listen... Pearl: What were they for? Athena: Oh, she gave me some kind of explanation... ...but I don't remember now. It was too difficult for a little kid to understand. Phoenix: Okay... But let me say this one thing. I don't think your mother only thought of you as some handy subject for her research. Athena: I... I want to believe that. But just about the only things my mother left me with are Widget... ...and this earring. Pearl: Ooh! It's beautiful! Athena: It's made of a piece of real moon rock she had for research. Maybe she did love me, in her own way... Phoenix: I'm sure of it. I'm really sure she did. (Because that's what I want to believe, too.) Moon Rock Earring added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (I'd better ask her a little more about her mother's research. I should show her that paper I found in the robotics lab.) Your mother's work (appears after \"The day of the crime\") Phoenix: What kind of research was Dr. Cykes... your mother... doing?

I should show her that paper I found in the robotics lab.) Seven years ago (appears after \"Your mother's work\", then presenting Robots with a Heart) Phoenix: On a different subject... Did you hear about the person holding up the Space Center? Athena: Yes, a little. And this person has even taken hostages? Phoenix: (I guess I'd better spare her the news about Trucy...) Well... ...after some negotiating, we agreed to do a retrial of the case from seven years ago. Athena: What? You're kidding me! So that means... Prosecutor Blackquill might...?! Phoenix: Yup. I know he's innocent. I just have to prove it. So, wait. Did you know him back then? Athena: Yes. He used to come visit my mom a lot. He studied psychology under her, and would sometimes ask for advice on his legal cases. He was very kind and considerate, and straight as an arrow. Phoenix: (Unlike now, where he's more twisted than a basket of snakes...) Athena: That's why I took the witness stand during his trial seven years ago. \"Please! You have to listen to me!\" Athena: \"He didn't kill her! His heart is screaming that he didn't kill her!\" Athena: I was a fool. How could anybody else know what I was talking about? Phoenix: (She heard... the voice of his heart...) Pearl: You were only eleven then, right? You were very brave just to give testimony. Phoenix: Pearls is right. You did the very best you could at the time. Athena: But... nothing I said did any good. I was a shaking and scared little girl, small and ineffectual. Even after I went to live with my relatives in Europe, I stayed closed up in my shell. Pearl: But you're different now! You're always so bright and cheerful! Athena: Thanks. That's because one day, I came to realize that I had to fight. I couldn't give up. I exercised hard and I studied hard. I wanted to become the strongest lawyer I could be. Why you became a lawyer (appears after \"Seven years ago\") Leads to: \"I wanted to save Simon, but I had no idea how.\" Present Robots with a Heart (after clearing \"Your mother's work\" Talk option) Athena: Oh, the Ponco series! You must've gone to the robotics lab. Phoenix: You seem to really love Ponco and Clonco. Athena: Yeah, my mother made them and I grew up around them, you know. Pearl: Oh, there's one of those cute little robots in this photo, too. Athena: Ha ha. See Ponco's bandages? I put those on her. I just wound them around and around. Pretty bad job, huh? But I really put my all into it. I hardly left the Center in those days, so I didn't have any human friends besides Junie. I didn't really understand the difference between robots and people back then. I thought that if a robot broke, bandaging it would help it get better. What a weirdo I was! Phoenix: It looks like there's something written on the bandages. Athena: Yeah, I wrote stuff like, \"Get well soon, Ponco!\" But, in the end, my mom just put her on the operating table and fixed her in a flash. Pearl: Oh! That must be the thing I made move in the robotics lab. Athena: I was so impressed by what my mom did. I even asked me if she would put me on the table and fix me if I ever got hurt. It looked just like magic to me, what she could do. Phoenix: (A little girl who grew up around robots... She seems to have some good memories of it.) Terran's Autopsy Report or Utility Knife Athena: Could it have been me who killed Clay...? Did I kill Apollo's friend...? Phoenix: Of course you didn't! We all believe in you. Athena: I hope that includes Apollo... Anything else Athena: *sigh* I wonder if I'll ever get the chance to present evidence like that again... I'll probably never work as a lawyer again now... Phoenix: Don't talk like that, Athena! We're going to clear you of all suspicion. Just you wait! Athena: I hope you can... I really hope you can... Athena: I wanted to save Simon, but I had no idea how. Then I met Mr. Wright, and thanks to him... ...I realized that if I became a lawyer, I could prove that Simon was innocent. I also realized that psychology could help me do this. I mean... ...psychology was my mother's specialty. When I studied it... ...I felt like she was there with me, supporting me. Phoenix: (It doesn't seem like Athena knows... ...that Prosecutor Blackquill is due to be executed tomorrow.) Athena: I wanted to prove Simon's innocence personally. I wanted to do it so bad... Even now, I want to fly out of here and go save him! Phoenix: (Come to think of it, she said something like that during the Themis Legal Academy trial. She mentioned there was somebody she wanted to save... She must've been talking about Prosecutor Blackquill...) Athena: I heard some prison guards say that you had an interview with Simon. How was he? What did he say? Phoenix: ............! (No! I can't tell her! But how can I lie to Athena?!) ...He was doing well. He was happy about the possibility of being proven innocent. Athena: He was? I wonder if he smiled, like he used to... back then... Phoenix: (If I can't prove Prosecutor Blackquill's innocence in this trial... ...I don't think Athena will ever forgive me... I just have to free him! Failure is not an option here!) Fulbright: Ah, I thought you might be here! Mr. Lawyer, we're in trouble! Phoenix: W-We are? What is it? Fulbright: I couldn't find a single open courtroom. They're all in session. Pearl: Oh, no! But this is an emergency! Fulbright: Hmm... It's very difficult to interrupt a trial once it's underway... Phoenix: My phone! ...It's from Trucy! ???: I told you I'd give you one hour. I guess it's time to pick one of the hostages... Phoenix: No! Wait! We still have a little more time! Besides... all of the courtrooms are being used right now! ???: Make all the excuses you want, but you won't get more time. Your daughter is first. The poor thing. She's a little too young to die, don't you think? Phoenix: NO! Don't you dare hurt her! (There has to be something I can do!) Fulbright: Nnngh... The cruelest injustice is about to befall us! Pearl: No! This can't be happening! Mystic Maya... help us! Phoenix: (Wait a minute... Maya...?) I read somewhere that you were holding a trial in the middle of an exploding courtroom? That must've really been something, although weird is par for the course with you. Phoenix: (A courtroom... blew up...! That's it! There IS a courtroom we can use after all!) ???: Okay, time's up! Too bad. Any last words you'd like to say to her? Phoenix: Phoenix: Aura, please don't add to the crimes you've already committed. ???: So you know who I am, do you? It wasn't like I was trying to keep it a secret anyway... Phoenix: We're ready to start the trial. We can hold it in the ruins of Courtroom No. 4, the one blown up by the bomber. Pearl: Oh! What a wonderful idea, Mr. Nick! Fulbright: I... I never would have thought of that! An astonishing trial in an astonishing location! I guess it's only befitting. I'll go get the place ready right away! Phoenix: (I didn't exactly pick the place for its \"astonishing\" factor...) How about it? Are you ready to have your brother's innocence proven? ???: My brother...? Heh. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Oh, I'm sorry. Did I forget to mention...? It's not Simon you'll be defending. Phoenix: What? (Not... Prosecutor Blackquill...?) ???: I indict Athena Cykes, on the charge of murdering her own mother! You'll be defending the little princess there, the one behind the glass. Phoenix: (WH-WHAAAT?!) ???: See you in that mountain of rubble you've chosen for our courtroom, Mr. Wright! Pearl: What is she talking about? Athena...?! Athena: Of course... Why didn't it ever occur to me before? If Prosecutor Blackquill is innocent, somebody else had to have been the true culprit. Did I..? Did I... kill my own mother...? N-No......... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! 5 BLACK PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: ! No way... It can't be true! Pearl: Mr. Nick! What's the matter?! Phoenix: I see... I see five black Psyche-Locks! (I've seen these kinds of locks before... Dark, black locks protecting a secret deep inside a person's heart... (And there's no way to remove them!) To be continued Wright Anything Agency (before clearing \"Why you became a lawyer\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room) Talk What to do Pearl: What a terrible situation this is! Phoenix: Trucy... I still can't believe it... Pearl: Trucy will be all right, Mr. Nick. She's such a strong girl. Phoenix: Yeah... I'm sure she's hanging in there. (But if anything were to happen to her...) S-She's counting on us, Pearls, so let's get out there and do what we can! Pearl: I agree! Any ideas? Pearl: That robot named Clonco... He's very articulate, isn't he? Phoenix: That wasn't the robot talking. It was the hostage-taker speaking through him. Pearl: What? You mean... there was a person inside the robot? Phoenix: No, it's not like that, Pearls. Pearl: Hmm? Then... what do you mean? Phoenix: How can I explain it? It's kind of like a telephone. Pearl: So it wasn't a robot. It was a telephone? Phoenix: Yes... No... Hold on. Now I'M confused! Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: Nothing special here. Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I think I have enough evidence, but maybe I should do a bit more thinking first...)\n-- Aura Blackquill's Theory --Fulbright: \"Simon isn't the murderer. He was trying to cover for someone.\"Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So Prosecutor Blackquill willingly accepted a death sentence to protect someone else? Fulbright: Yes, that is precisely what Ms. Blackquill appears to believe! Edgeworth: And that is what I believe as well. Prosecutor Blackquill is no murderer, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: But Athena Cykes certainly didn't kill anyone, either, Mr. Edgeworth. Edgeworth: So it appears neither of us can afford to go easy on the other. Fine. I expected no less. Judge: Ooh, I remember this tense atmosphere! It's so... invigorating! Fulbright: I'm only reading notes here, but yeah! I feel extra invigorated, too! So, let's keep going!Fulbright: \"Someone else was at the scene at the time they say Simon committed the murder.\"Press Phoenix: Phoenix: But that's just speculation! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: No, Ms. Blackquill has proper grounds for her claims. Phoenix: Phoenix: Then why didn't you say so in the first place?! Edgeworth: Edgeworth: You're the one who screamed \"Hold it!\" and cut me off! Phoenix: Fine, so maybe I jumped the gun by a teeny-weeny bit... Fulbright: Ha ha ha ha ha! Now I know what they mean when they say \"close enough to argue\"! ...Moving on!Fulbright: \"I mean, if he really was out to steal that moon rock, then why the rolling case?\"Press Phoenix: Phoenix: This rolling case... I suppose you mean the one... ...that existed in the photo with Prosecutor Blackquill in it... ...but was absent when the crime scene photos were taken? Edgeworth: Yes, that's the one. And Ms. Blackquill has drawn a conclusion from these two photos. Fulbright: She has?! And what is that conclusion?! Edgeworth: You're the one with her notes! Fulbright: Oh, right. Of course. Reading them now! So, why the rolling case...?Fulbright: \"Because he was using it to hide someone inside. That's why.\"Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And how do you propose he hid a person inside any of those cases?! Edgeworth: Hmph. Have you forgotten that we saw just such a thing only the other day? At your own daughter's magic show, she fit a grown person into a small box. Phoenix: Oh, yeah... (Way to ruin the memory of a good day!) Judge: A magic show! I wish you would have thought to invite me...! Fulbright: Actually, I would've liked to go, too! Phoenix: Uh, m-my apologies. I'll invite you both next time. I promise. (So... Wait a minute. What were we talking about again?) Fulbright: Prosecutor Blackquill was using the case to hide someone.Fulbright: \"And the only person small enough to fit inside that case... was Athena Cykes!\"Press Phoenix: Phoenix: But that's nothing more than conjecture, and it's hardly the only possibility! Fulbright: In that case, what do YOU think Prosecutor Blackquill had in that case? Phoenix: I think it was... the moon rock... Edgeworth: Edgeworth: There were three cases at the scene, but Prosecutor Blackquill used the largest one. The moon rock was egg-shaped and only about eight inches in diameter. It wouldn't have made any sense to use the largest case there just to move that rock. Phoenix: Phoenix: Be that as it may, it doesn't prove Ms. Cykes was inside! Edgeworth: Hmph. Then let me ask you this... Can you come up with a better theory of what was in the case? Judge: Well, Mr. Wright? Can you? Phoenix: (Yikes. Give a guy some time to think... Let's see... Should I try to bluff my way through what could have been in that case?) Bluff Leads to: \"I know exactly what Prosecutor Blackquill carried from the scene.\" Don't bluff Phoenix: (I guess I'd better wait and see how it goes.) Leads back to cross-examinationPhoenix: (It's a clever theory, but it doesn't look like they have any solid proof. If I push, maybe I can uncover some flaws in it.)Phoenix: I know exactly what Prosecutor Blackquill carried from the scene. (I just have to find something else that was missing, right? No sweat!)Judge: Ooh, I'd be very interested in hearing your theory... if it's true, that is.Phoenix: This is a crime scene photo taken after Prosecutor Blackquill left, correct? All we have to do is compare this with... ...this photo of Prosecutor Blackquill to see what's missing. If he took something with him, then it should be in one of these photos! (Lady Luck, don't fail me now...)Judge: All right then, Mr. Wright. Let us hear your theory. What did Prosecutor Blackquill take from the scene of the murder?Present bandaged robot arm Phoenix: Leads to: \"Please note that there is a robot part on top of the cart in this photo.\"Present anywhere else Phoenix: Phoenix: He took this! Edgeworth: ...I'm afraid I never heard mention of that being removed from the crime scene... Phoenix: ............ (He saw straight through that!) Edgeworth: Tell me you have something more substantial than that, Wright! Judge: Well, I have something more substantial for him: a penalty. Phoenix: (I'd better compare the two photos again. Okay, in this photo, I see... ...the operating table, the katana, a cart... and the stuff on said cart... Are any of those things different in this photo taken after the incident?) Leads back to: \"What did Prosecutor Blackquill take from the scene of the murder?\"Phoenix: Please note that there is a robot part on top of the cart in this photo. However, in this photo taken after the crime, the robot part is gone. In other words, this part is something that was taken from the scene of the crime!Judge: Hmm... You do appear to be right. I don't see it in the second picture.Fulbright: But it's just a piece of junk. How important could it be?Phoenix: (Is it really just an insignificant robot part? ............Speaking of which...)Aura: Wh-What are you looking at?! I'm gonna start charging for each glance, per eyeball!Phoenix: (Stingy, stingy. What happened to the age of free previews?) *ahem* Your Honor, about this robot part... Doesn't it look like it could be an arm from that robot there?Judge: Well! Now that you mention it, it does, doesn't it. But the case is still too big to be practical for just the moon rock and a robot arm.Phoenix: (But was it really just the one arm that was in there? If it wasn't Athena in the case, then maybe...) I believe there was another robot at the scene that looks just like the one here. Your Honor, it is the defense's assertion that it was this other robot that was in the case!Judge: Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: We can't be certain that part belonged to a robot. Yes, it looks like the arm of the one before us, but it could be something else entirely. Besides, it's wrapped entirely in bandaging, making it difficult to verify what it is.Phoenix:Phoenix: I know for a fact that it is a robot arm. I can even tell which robot it belonged to, just by looking at it! With this information, we can investigate whether it was there at the time or not.Judge: But, Mr. Wright! I thought you were more of the technologically illiterate type. When did you become such an expert? I feel... somehow abandoned...Phoenix: Not to worry, Your Honor. I still know next to nothing about machines. But I know this piece of evidence proves which robot the arm belonged to!Present HAT-1 Exhibit Phoenix: Leads to: \"The robot in this picture is named Ponco.\"Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: I-Is this conclusive enough for you?! Edgeworth: It's perfectly conclusive... of your utter incompetence. Phoenix: (Can't you be normal for once and simply say, \"That's wrong!\"?) Judge: You've conclusively earned yourself a penalty as well, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Well, given the arm's distinctive feature, this is one conclusion that won't escape me!) I may not know my hard disk from my floppy drive... Leads back to: \"But I know this piece of evidence proves which robot the arm belonged to!\"Phoenix: The robot in this picture is named Ponco. But take a look at Ponco's arm. It was Ms. Cykes who bandaged it up like that.Judge: She must have thought that machines heal in the same way that people do. What an adorable, naïve mistake! It reminds me of my own grandchild...Phoenix: The robot arm at the crime scene had the same bandaging wrapped around it. In other words, this robot arm could belong to none other than Ponco!Judge: Order in the court! Order, I say! Prosecutor Edgeworth, what do you have to say to this?!Edgeworth: I concede that the robot is about the same size as a child. But it cannot grab its knees and curl itself up into a ball. Even if it was the largest of the cases, the robot couldn't have possibly fit in there!Judge: The case does comes [sic] up to about mid-thigh on Prosecutor Blackquill. Hmm... I see your point. The robot is much taller than that.Phoenix: (They've got me there... So then, did Prosecutor Blackquill make Ponco fit into the case by...?)Dismantling her Leads to: \"Of course Ponco would fit. All Prosecutor Blackquill had to do was dismantle her.\"Compacting her Phoenix: Couldn't he have crunched Ponco up and compacted her a bit? You know, kind of like... ...when you suck the air out of those storage bags with a vacuum cleaner? Edgeworth: ...Hmm. Interesting theory. Why don't we conduct an experiment, then? Detective Fulbright, could you please bring us a storage bag and a vacuum cleaner? Let's try to compact Mr. Wright here, and see if we can't fit him in the rubbish bin. Phoenix: ............On second thought, let's just scrap the whole idea and start over, okay? Judge: Very well, but one man's trash is that same man's penalty. Phoenix: Gah! Leads back to: \"So then, did Prosecutor Blackquill make Ponco fit into the case by...?\"Phoenix: Of course Ponco would fit. All Prosecutor Blackquill had to do was dismantle her. Once taken apart, the robot could have easily fit inside that rolling case!Edgeworth: Hmm... It appears to be a robot-assembly device.Pearl: \"Disassemble anything in a flash! Push the 'Dismantle' button!\" That sounds pretty neat! Can I push it, Mr. Nick?Judge: Hmm... It sounds rather violent, but Mr. Wright does have a point there.Edgeworth:Edgeworth: Except that there was a body on the table where robots are dismantled and assembled. There would have been no room to take the robot apart.Phoenix:Phoenix: But what if it wasn't done on the table? What if the katana was used instead?Judge: Y-You mean... the sword?Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. Ms. Blackquill, I'd like your opinion as a woman of science. Isn't it true that the katana could have been used to take the robot apart?!Aura: I... I suppose so...! Their joints aren't made of a very tough material. A blade could slice through them.Phoenix: Thank you for your expert opinion, Ms. Blackquill. Thanks to you, we now know... ...that the existence of the severed arm in this photo proves that Ponco was taken apart. In addition, since the rest of Ponco was not found at the scene, we can conclude that... ...the true meaning of this photo is very different from the original interpretation.Judge: ...Y-You can't mean...?!Phoenix: That's exactly what I mean. This photo does NOT capture the moment of the murder. It is instead a picture of the moment after the robot was sliced apart. The blood you see where the arm was cut off was transferred there by the bloody katana. Most likely, the rest of Ponco is scattered around Prosecutor Blackquill's feet...Aura: Not hearing this...!Phoenix: Therefore, what was transported inside that case was not the defendant, but a robot! Ms. Cykes never was at the scene at the time of the murder!Aura: Nnnnngh... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! ...My head! My head! My body! Where am I?! Gaaagh!Judge: Order! Order in the court!Aura: It's true that Ponco was found in pieces after the murder... And I'll admit I repaired her myself afterwards.Photo of the Crime updated in the Court Record.Phoenix: (Yes! I'm finally making some progress! Hopefully, I've gotten at least one step closer... ...to proving both Athena and Prosecutor Blackquill innocent...)Edgeworth:Edgeworth: Well played, Mr. Wright. You've made your point abundantly clear. I concede that it wasn't the defendant inside the rolling case, but the robot.Phoenix: (All right... What's going on here? It's never good when he plays things this straight...)Judge: Does the prosecution withdraw its claim that the defendant was carried from the scene?Edgeworth: No, Your Honor. My claim hasn't changed.Phoenix:Phoenix: But Ponco and Ms. Cykes couldn't have both been inside that case!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: The notion that the case was used to carry Ms. Cykes was Ms. Blackquill's theory. I have been of a different opinion from the outset. Now I finally have the opportunity to voice my theory... ...thanks to the defense.Phoenix: (Edgeworth... He's been one step ahead of me this whole time!)Judge: In that case, how do you propose the defendant left the crime scene?Edgeworth: Simple. The footage only shows Prosecutor Blackquill from behind. What's more... ...he's holding his arm in front of his body, as if he were holding something, or someone...Phoenix: That's hardly evidence.Edgeworth: I have proof: the surcoat Prosecutor Blackquill was wearing. The victim's blood was found on the front of it and the stain had a highly distinctive shape.Judge: A bloodstain? With a distinctive shape? Please continue, Prosecutor Edgeworth.Edgeworth: Seven years ago, the defendant was known to constantly wear a certain item... ...of which there is only one in the world: a special pair of headphones made just for her.Woods: She always wore these big, heavy-looking headphones. She said her mother made them for her, as part of her research.Edgeworth: Analysis showed the bloodstain to be in the exact same shape as these headphones. In other words, this was no mere blood splatter. The blood went from the victim's body... to the headphones... and then... ...was imprinted onto Prosecutor Blackquill's coat like a stamp.Judge: A most gruesome stamp, indeed...Edgeworth: Blackquill carried Ms. Cykes, who had been hit by splatter, away from the crime scene. This proves that Athena Cykes was, without question, present at the crime scene. And that... concludes the prosecution's argument.Phoenix: Ngaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!Judge: Order! ...If the defendant was indeed at the scene, it deepens the suspicion against her.Phoenix:Phoenix: But we've also shown that the robot was there at the scene as well!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: I hope you're not making the ridiculous claim that a simple robot was the real murderer?Phoenix: (I don't really think that, no, but...) You can't say the possibility isn't there! Detective Fulbright, was the robot questioned at the time?Fulbright: No, I don't see any record of it. I believe it was considered \"unrelated to the case.\"Phoenix: But, as it turned out, the robot was actually integrally related. Your Honor, the defense would like to call Ponco to the stand!Judge: A r-robot witness?! Order! Order in the court! ...Prosecutor Edgeworth, what do you think about this?Edgeworth: Hmph. Mr. Wright has called all manner of witnesses to the stand over the years. So why not a robot? Nothing surprises me anymore with him.Judge: Very well. I will allow the witness. ...Bailiff! Please summon the robot named Ponco!Edgeworth: Witness, please state your name and occupation.Ponco: My name is not \"witness\"! My name is Ponco!Edgeworth: Yes, I realize that. But when you are at the witness stand, you are the \"witness.\"Ponco: No, I'm not! I'm Ponco! Say it with me! \"Ponco\"!Edgeworth: What an utterly inflexible little robot!Phoenix: (You're the last person who should be calling anybody \"inflexible\"...)Judge: Ha ha! You remind me of my grandchild who just learned his own name. Oh, how precious!Edgeworth: All right, Ponco... I'm going to ask you some questions.Ponco: Questions? You have questions? Hooray! What are your questions?Edgeworth: I want to know if you were there at the scene of the murder of Metis Cykes. It was seven years ago, on the 7th of October around 2 PM, in the robotics lab.Ponco: Certainly! Just one moment! Searching data............ Search complete! Yes, I was there in the robotics lab!Edgeworth: It would seem this robot's testimony is necessary to this case after all.Phoenix: (This is great! I just KNEW Ponco must've seen something important!)Judge: A murder committed right before this poor little girl's eyes! It's inexcusable!Phoenix: (The judge seems ready to adopt Ponco as another grandchild...)Judge: So, little Ponco, do you think you can give us your testimony today...?Witness Testimony-- What I Saw --Ponco: I went to the robotics lab at about 2 PM for my regular recharge! Just as I was about to charge up, Athena came in and hugged Mommy Metis! And then Mommy Metis fell down. After that, I was recharging, so I don't know anything. After I charged up, I was cleaning the room, and Mr. Simon came in. And then an error occurred. There is no data after that point.Judge: Well, it sounds like the defendant was, without question, at the scene. However, it doesn't appear that the witness saw the actual moment of the murder.Edgeworth: I disagree. This testimony shows that the defendant did indeed commit the crime.Phoenix: ...What?Edgeworth: At the end of the day, we mustn't forget that this witness is still a machine. Being a robot, its understanding and capacity to express itself are limited.Judge: S-So what are you suggesting?Edgeworth: The witness's statements need to be interpreted. For example, the terms \"hugged,\" and then, later, \"fell down.\" Adults don't usually fall down after being hugged by a child.Judge: They don't, but...!Edgeworth: Yes. What this witness's statements are telling us is... ...that the defendant stabbed the victim with the murder weapon during this moment!Phoenix: WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!Edgeworth: Before Ms. Cykes hugged Dr. Cykes, did the two of them converse?Ponco: Yes, they did. They spoke to each other very loudly! But I don't know what they said. Athena is usually so quiet, so I was surprised!Edgeworth: \"Spoke very loudly.\" We can interpret this to mean \"they argued.\"Judge: I see. Murder after a heated argument... And then the victim \"fell down.\" I agree that it does sound like a reasonable interpretation. However, Ponco doesn't seem to remember anything that happened after that.Ponco: When I am recharging, I go into sleep mode. But I remember everything before that! I have a very good memory!Edgeworth: You may as well admit defeat now, Wright; a cross-examination would be useless.Phoenix: D-Don't be ridiculous! A cross-examination is never useless!Edgeworth: Until now. Think about it! Robots don't lie. This robot is both an important witness and valuable evidence at the same time.Phoenix: Nevertheless... I will have my cross-examination!Edgeworth: Hmph. I see you haven't changed. You never were one to worry about wasting time.Judge: Very well. Even if it may be a waste of time, you may proceed, Mr. Wright.Phoenix: (I'll show you both just how fruitful any cross-examination can be!)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- What I Saw --Ponco: I went to the robotics lab at about 2 PM for my regular recharge!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Your \"regular recharge\"? What is that, exactly? Ponco: I have to refill my battery's power or else I stop working! I go to the lab to do that. Edgeworth: So that recharge occurred around 2 PM, around the time of the murder? Ponco: That's right! I go every day at 2 PM!Ponco: Just as I was about to charge up, Athena came in and hugged Mommy Metis!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: (\"Hugged\" her, huh? Which Edgeworth took to mean \"stabbed her with a weapon.\") You said the two of them were talking before Ms. Cykes hugged her mother, is that right? Ponco: Yes, they were talking very loudly. But I couldn't tell what they were saying. Phoenix: Couldn't tell? Even though they were speaking so loudly? Ponco: I'm only allowed to listen to voices that are directed at me. Edgeworth: Hmph. If it listened to every voice, it would be little better than a mobile eavesdropper. Phoenix: (Well, that explains why some of Ponco's testimony is so vague...) Edgeworth: It's a shame that our little friend wasn't listening in, however. We could've learned what they were talking about just before Dr. Cykes was killed. Now then, what happened after that?Ponco: And then Mommy Metis fell down. After that, I was recharging, so I don't know anything.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: (I don't want to delve too deeply here, but...) Could you tell us how the victim appeared and acted at this moment? Ponco: Mommy Metis was very surprised when she was hugged. I heard her heart pound. Phoenix: Her heart...? Edgeworth: Mr. Wright, have you forgotten about this document we found in the robotics lab? These robots have a heartbeat detection system. Phoenix: (Now that he mentions it, I do remember reading something like that there... They detect the presence of people by the sound of their heartbeats. But wait a minute... That means... ...if Dr. Cykes really did die at this moment...) Ponco, how was Dr. Cykes after she fell down? Could you still hear the sound of her heartbeat? Ponco: Let's see. The moment she fell, her heart was pounding. After that, I don't know. I started recharging just then. Phoenix: Of all the unlucky timing! If you had heard anything after that... ...it could have possibly proved that the hug wasn't actually the moment of the murder! Ponco: I'm very sorry. I'm afraid I don't know. I'm very sorry... Edgeworth: The robot is designed to go into sleep mode automatically, so it can't be helped... But it does appear it detected an increased heart rate at the moment of the stabbing. Phoenix: Ngh... Ponco: After Mommy Metis's heart started pounding in surprise, she fell by the window. It was the round window, on the workbench side of the room! Phoenix: (The workbench, huh...? Ponco must be talking about that table to the right of where that giant robot is now. Is there something critical in Ponco's statement just now?) There is something Phoenix: Your Honor, I believe this statement is critical. I'd like it added to her testimony! Judge: Very well. Ponco, could you please add that statement to your testimony? That's a good little girl! Adds statement \"Mommy Metis fell down near the round window on the workbench side of the room!\" Never mind Phoenix: ............ (Nothing particularly important, I guess.) So, what happened after that, Ponco? Leads back to cross-examinationPress (after adding statement) Phoenix: Phoenix: (I don't want to delve too deeply here, but...) Could you tell us how the victim appeared and acted at this moment? Ponco: Mommy Metis was very surprised when she was hugged. I heard her heart pound. Phoenix: Her heart...? Edgeworth: Mr. Wright, have you forgotten about this document we found in the robotics lab? These robots have a heartbeat detection system. Phoenix: (Now that he mentions it, I do remember reading something like that there... They detect the presence of people by the sound of their heartbeats. But wait a minute...

Ponco: After Mommy Metis's heart started pounding in surprise, she fell by the window. It was the round window, on the workbench side of the room! Phoenix: (The workbench, huh...? Ponco must be talking about that table to the right of where that giant robot is now.)Ponco: Mommy Metis fell down near the round window on the workbench side of the room!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Let's see... There are two round windows in the robotics lab. Which one did you mean? Ponco: The one on the right, near the hanging scroll! That hanging scroll was Mommy Metis's prized possession! Phoenix: (Okay, in the pictures of the crime scene from seven years ago, there is definitely... ...a hanging scroll and a Japanese theater mask hanging on the workbench-side wall. But is there some problem with this statement...?)Present Seven-Year-Old Photos Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ponco, your statement may have just inspired a breakthrough.\"Ponco: After I charged up, I was cleaning the room, and Mr. Simon came in.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Prosecutor Blackquill? I wonder what he went there for? Ponco: His objective? I don't know! I don't know! Phoenix: (Hmm... I guess I can't very well ask Ponco to speculate...) So what happened after Prosecutor Blackquill arrived?Ponco: And then an error occurred. There is no data after that point.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You don't remember what happened next? (Hmm... An \"error,\" huh? I wonder if...) Ponco: All data is suddenly cut off at that point. I don't know anything after that! Edgeworth: The answer to that question is right here. According to the defense's theory, this photo shows when the robot was being taken apart. Phoenix: Exactly. We can conclude that... ...Ponco's \"error\" was the result of her being dismantled. Edgeworth: Indeed. The bodies of these robots are designed to be controlled remotely... ...by a separate computer. Phoenix: (Yes, that's basically what Ms. Blackquill explained to us, too. She said their hearts and memories are stored on a separate computer.) Edgeworth: When the witness was taken apart, she lost the use of her body, but not her memories. That's how she is now still able to give testimony about the events of that day. Judge: Fascinating. It's as if she can be seriously wounded, but her soul still burns.Phoenix: (There are a few parts of Ponco's testimony that are hard to interpret. Edgeworth chose to interpret \"hugged\" as \"stabbed\"... ...but I'd better try to iron out who did what where and to whom for myself... Hold on, Athena! I'm going to save you!)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Athena Cykes\nDescription: A new lawyer at the agency.

    "cot": "Evidence 8 (Photo of the Crime) shows that Simon Blackquill was taking the robot apart and there is a bloodstain at the end of the robot's arm. According to testimonies by Ponco (especially Testimonies 1, 2, and 5), Athena hugged Metis, the victim, who then fell down, and Ponco started recharging and thus stopped recording data (\"error occurred\"). This implies that the stabbing occurred during the hug and that Athena was present at the time of the murder.\n\nHowever, the photo (Evidence 8) was used as evidence against Simon Blackquill, showing him with the bloody katana and the robot's arm, implying he committed the murder, while Ponco's testimony describes Athena's presence and seems to indicate that Athena stabbed Metis, not Simon Blackquill.\n\nThis creates a conflict between the photo as evidence implicating Blackquill and Ponco's testimony indicating Athena was the killer. The contradiction is not only in who the evidence points to as the murderer (photo vs. testimony).\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 8 and Testimonies 1 through 5 by Ponco.\n\nSince only one testimony must be chosen, Testimony 1 (\"Just as I was about to charge up, Athena came in and hugged Mommy Metis!\") is selected as it directly conflicts with the narrative depicted in the evidence.\n",

December 20, 1:23 PMWright Anything Agency Phoenix: (They took Athena from the courtroom, straight to the station. She's probably being questioned at this very moment.) ............ (After this past year, I took it for granted that those two would always be here. But now, Apollo has gone off on his own to seek his own truth... ...and my pursuit of the truth only ended up with Athena becoming the new suspect. Some boss I turned out to be...) Trucy: ............ It's even quieter in here than usual. Phoenix: Yeah... It seems so empty, too. Trucy: I just don't get it, Daddy. All of your reasoning during the trial seemed perfectly solid... Phoenix: Yeah... And I still believe it was... At least, based on what we know. Trucy: But now, Athena is the one who's being accused... Phoenix: During the trial for the bombing and murder that occurred at the Cosmos Space Center... ...the lighter used by the real culprit was found. This lighter proved the defendant, Solomon Starbuck, innocent. But Athena's prints were found on it instead... ...and she was subsequently arrested for the murder. Trucy: But Athena couldn't have done it. It just doesn't make any sense. Phoenix: (No, none of it does. I've been racking my brain, but I just can't figure it out! Argh! Where is the flaw in my reasoning? What have I got wrong in this case?) Trucy: You know, Daddy... if Athena was here... ...she wouldn't just be sitting around thinking. She'd be out there doing something. You ARE going to defend Athena, right, Daddy? Phoenix: Of course I will! And thanks, Trucy. I needed that push. (Trucy's right! The trial is tomorrow. There's no time to waste! If I'm going to prove Athena's innocence, I'd better get out there and find some evidence!) Trucy: Off we go, then! We're on a hunt for evidence that'll prove Athena's innocence! Phoenix: (Great! But before we go, I'd better tidy up the evidence I have on hand...) Unnecessary evidence left at the office. Phoenix: (Athena is probably still in the middle of being questioned... ...so Trucy's right. The thing to start with is talking to people at the Space Center.) Talk What to do Trucy: I still can't believe Apollo really left us... Phoenix: It was so sudden. Trucy: Maybe he got tired of being my assistant for my magic tricks? Phoenix: I don't think it's your fault, Trucy. Trucy: B-But I made him clean the toilet a lot! And I made him go bring in the newspaper! It WAS my fault! I just know it! Oh, Apollo! *sniffle* Phoenix: I really don't think it was your fault, Trucy. But I didn't realize Apollo was wearing so many hats around here, either. Any ideas? Trucy: How could they suspect Athena? It's just ridiculous. It must be some kind of conspiracy. Phoenix: A conspiracy, huh? Well, it certainly is some kind of mistake, that's for sure. Trucy: First of all, we have to bust Athena out of the Detention Center. Then we have to chase down the people who framed her. We'll sneak around the world, from Kiev to Carolina, with the fuzz hot on our tails! Phoenix: Isn't that exactly the same as the plot of the movie you watched the other day? Present Attorney's Badge Trucy: I guess presenting your attorney's badge... ...is like your \"quick trick,\" huh, Daddy? Phoenix: Ha ha ha. So it's just a trick to you, huh? Trucy: Well, you are one of the talents in our Wright Anything Agency, after all. But I have to say that an attorney's badge won't get many laughs... Phoenix: I don't care if I get laughs, as long as I can clear my client's name. Trucy: Ha ha ha! That's a good one, Daddy! Phoenix: I'm no match for you, though, Trucy. Space Center Pamphlet Trucy: Space, huh... I'd sure love to go up there someday. Will you take me, Daddy? Phoenix: Ha ha ha. It's not like taking somebody to an amusement park, you know. Trucy: Well, you hardly ever take me to one of those, either! You either say, \"I don't have any money\" or \"I don't have time\"! Phoenix: F-Fine. I'll take you on my next day off. Trucy: You're the best, Daddy! Phoenix: Ha ha ha. (I'm no match for Trucy...) Anything else Trucy: Daddy, you should be careful about showing evidence to a magician. Phoenix: That's true. You can make anything disappear. Trucy: Well, anything up to about a yard in diameter, anyway. My magic panties are an extra-dimensional space! Phoenix: I guess only a space probe can help us figure out how they work then, huh. December 20Cosmos Space Center - Entrance Phoenix: Director Cosmos! Do you have a minute?! Cosmos: Urgk! Galactic Scooter! Full speed ahead! Phoenix: Director! (He scooted away...) Trucy: His expression changed the instant he saw you, Daddy! Phoenix: (Yeah, well, I dragged his name through the mud pretty good at the trial earlier today...) December 20Cosmos Space Center - Boarding Lounge Phoenix: We were here only yesterday... Oh, hey! Mr. Starbuck! You've been released, huh? Starbuck: Yup. And I came straight here. This is all thanks to you and your team, Mr. Wright! You've given me a second chance to fly into space again. I can't thank you enough. Except... Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... Phoenix: Wh-What's wrong? (I thought he'd be happy to be acquitted...) Starbuck: As I was coming out of the Detention Center, I saw Miss Cykes. Phoenix: (H-He saw Athena?) Starbuck: I was at a loss for words. I didn't know what to say to the poor girl. And then, you know what? She flashed a peace sign at me. \"Congratulations on your acquittal,\" she said. \"Now you can go back into space someday.\" Phoenix: (Yeah, that sounds like Athena. I can just picture it.) Starbuck: But I saw her eyes. They were red and swollen from crying. She's gotta be suffering! She must be so worried! And yet she went out of her way to be nice and give me that big smile! Trucy: She held back her own tears so she could give someone else a smile. That's... so Athena. Starbuck: There's no question about it. That girl is innocent. Please, Mr. Wright. You have to make sure she goes free! And then, they can put me in prison instead! I don't mind! Phoenix: (We can't have that either, Mr. Starbuck!) Don't worry, Mr. Starbuck. I'm going to give her the very best defense I can. I promise to get her acquitted, just like I did for you. Starbuck: I know she'll be all right with you in her corner. I know you'll never give up on her. Apollo has a fine boss to look up to! Talk About the murder Starbuck: I still can't believe Launch Pad 1 was switched with the Space Museum... Phoenix: What could have made Director Cosmos do such a thing? Starbuck: I haven't the foggiest idea. Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... So there never was gonna be a launch that day, not from the very beginning... I wonder if Clay knew...? Phoenix: I imagine he must have. Surely he would've noticed when you went to board the rocket. Starbuck: It's pathetic to think I was the only one who got taken in. Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... But I guess that's about how it goes, when you're worth less than space debris. Trucy: Is he... going to be all right, Daddy? His expression looks as dark as a black hole... Phoenix: Well... That's just how he is. The murderer (appears after \"About the murder\") Phoenix: Mr. Starbuck, do you remember anything about the murderer? Starbuck: Not really. I only saw a shadowy figure in the dark after all. Phoenix: (Yeah, I guess that was a little too much to hope for...) Starbuck: Hey, I heard something from the police, though. They said they never did find a .10-caliber gun down that trash chute. Phoenix: Just as I thought. The culprit must've carried it away with them when they escaped. Trucy: So, was the person you saw holding a gun, Mr. Starbuck? Starbuck: Umm... I couldn't really tell. Phoenix: But it wasn't Athena, right? Could you tell if the person was male or female, tall or short? Starbuck: I-I can't even tell you that much. Man, I'm useless... When the culprit opened the door and some light came in, I should've been able to see... Phoenix: The door... Ah, yes... As I recall, they opened this door here as they made their escape... Trucy: The door to Launch Pad 1, right? Starbuck: Yeah, except, right now, the door leads to the Space Museum. Phoenix: You mean the launch pad and the Space Museum are switched right now? Starbuck: Yeah, they're trying to investigate the theory you came up with in court. Phoenix: So they're recreating the conditions, huh? (I'd like to see what's beyond that door now.) Mr. Starbuck, could you open this door for us? Starbuck: Sure. Just let me have my prints scanned here... The murderer (subsequent times) Phoenix: Mr. Starbuck, do you remember anything about the murderer? Starbuck: Not really. I only saw a shadowy figure in the dark after all. Phoenix: (Yeah, I guess that was a little too much to hope for...) Starbuck: Hey, I heard something from the police, though. They said they never did find a .10-caliber gun down that trash chute. Phoenix: Just as I thought. The culprit must've carried it away with them when they escaped. Trucy: So, was the person you saw holding a gun, Mr. Starbuck? Starbuck: Umm... I couldn't really tell. Phoenix: But it wasn't Athena, right? Could you tell if the person was male or female, tall or short? Starbuck: I-I can't even tell you that much. Man, I'm useless... When the culprit opened the door and some light came in, I should've been able to see... Switching the launch pads (appears after \"The murderer\") Leads to: \"Do the launch pads get switched back and forth a lot?\" Present Terran's Autopsy Report Starbuck: Clay always used to cheerfully greet me in a loud voice. Phoenix: And he did vocal exercises every morning, sometimes until he was hoarse, right? Starbuck: Exactly. You could always hear him, even through the wall-- Hey, wait a minute. Did you know Clay? Phoenix: No, but like attracts like, as they say. Anything else Phoenix: Do you know anything about this piece of evidence? Starbuck: No... Sorry I'm so useless... Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... Phoenix: No, no. It's all right. There's no need to get all depressed! Phoenix: Do the launch pads get switched back and forth a lot? Starbuck: Well, back when the Space Museum was Launch Pad 2... ...they used to switch the pads around at times. Phoenix: But these days, Launch Pad 2 is only used as a tourist attraction, right? Starbuck: Right. 'Cause, quite frankly, the Space Center needs the money. Phoenix: (I hear you... Times sure are tough...) Trucy: Daddy, let's go check out what's beyond that door! Phoenix: Sure. Let's go. Starbuck: Hey, why don't I come along? I can show you around! Examine Leaves Phoenix: Huh? I wonder what these dead leaves are doing here? Trucy: Maybe they were stuck to the bottom of somebody's shoes. There are lots of trees around the Space Center. Phoenix: (She's right. It's a modern, state-of-the-art building, but it's surrounded by trees.) But I don't know. If they were stuck to the bottom of somebody's shoes... ...wouldn't they look more crushed up? These don't look like they've been stepped on. Trucy: Maybe there's some kind of secret hatch in the corridor, and they came in that way? Phoenix: Not everything is set up like a magician's stage, you know. Fingerprint scanner Phoenix: So this is another one of those devices for opening the door, huh? Starbuck: Yup. But this one doesn't require fingerprint verification. You just hit the button and \"open sesame\"! Trucy: So when you and Clay went through here, you didn't need to show your prints, either? Phoenix: That's right, Trucy. Just like how the culprit didn't need to scan their prints... ...when they escaped back out of the Space Museum corridor into Boarding Lounge 2. Launch Pad 1 Door Lock updated in the Court Record. Fingerprint scanner (subsequent times) Phoenix: So this is another one of those devices for opening the door, huh? Starbuck: Yup. But this one doesn't require fingerprint verification. You just hit the button and \"open sesame\"! Trucy: So when you and Clay went through here, you didn't need to show your prints, either? Phoenix: That's right, Trucy. Just like how the culprit didn't need to scan their prints... ...when they escaped back out of the Space Museum corridor into Boarding Lounge 2. After examining leaves and fingerprint scanner: Phoenix: (Well, I don't see anything else that jumps out at me. And I imagine this corridor is built exactly like the Launch Pad 1 corridor.) Talk Switching the launch pads Phoenix: Do the launch pads get switched back and forth a lot? Starbuck: Well, back when the Space Museum was Launch Pad 2... ...they used to switch the pads around at times. Phoenix: But these days, Launch Pad 2 is only used as a tourist attraction, right? Starbuck: Right. 'Cause, quite frankly, the Space Center needs the money. Phoenix: (I hear you... Times sure are tough...) Trucy: So, right now, this Boarding Lounge 1 is connected to the Space Museum... Phoenix: I guess the police are trying to re-create the conditions of the crime. Trucy: And just now, when we checked the hallway on the other side of the door... Phoenix: Yeah, it looks like that door opens from the corridor side without fingerprint verification. Trucy: So when Clay and Mr. Starbuck went through, they didn't need to scan their prints, either. Phoenix: That's right. Just like how the culprit didn't need to scan their prints... ...when they escaped back out of the Space Museum corridor into Boarding Lounge 2. Trucy: And remember there were those dead leaves in the corridor? I wonder where they came from? Hmm... I still think maybe they were stuck to the bottom of somebody's shoes. Phoenix: (I don't know. Those leaves didn't look like they'd been stepped on to me...) December 20Cosmos Space Center - Entrance Cosmos: Urgn! Curse the wretch who sullied my good name! Reverse course and full speed away! Phoenix: Director Cosmos! Wait! Trucy: I'll handle this, Daddy! Take that! Cosmos: Gaaaaagh! The mobility system has been compromised! Phoenix: (Trucy's knife throw was a direct hit to one of his tires!) Trucy: And the streak continues! Phoenix: (Maybe I should've kept a closer watch on what tricks she's been practicing...) Cosmos: My dear, old battleship! We fought many a skirmish together! It has been an honor... Trucy: Daddy! He's going to blow that thing up! Phoenix: Nah. I bet all that button will do is make it go haywire again. Cosmos: ............Very well. I surrender. As a prisoner of war, I expect to be treated honorably. Talk Switching the launch pads Phoenix: Director Cosmos, when you were talking in court about switching the launch pads... ...you used your right to remain silent about the reason as to why. Phoenix: I'd like Director Cosmos to tell us... ...why he switched the two launch pads to begin with. Cosmos: Nnngh... Please... I can't... I... I exercise my right to remain silent... But I will say... my hands were tied... I was only doing what I could to keep my men from getting caught in that blast. Nngh... Nnnggggh... Cosmos: The center of the cosmos is shrouded in mystery! But I don't have any secrets left... ...now that my battleship has been destroyed and I've been taken prisoner! 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (No secrets left, huh? I beg to differ. Looks like I'll have to undo his Psyche-Locks if I want to get to the bottom of this.) Present Magatama Phoenix: 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Behind the Switching of the Launch Pads -- Phoenix: I want you to tell me everything you're hiding about the switching of the two launch pads. Cosmos: I refuse! You can't make me! I can hold out longer than anyone! Phoenix: (I hope I never get like this when I'm old... Now, let's see. Where to start?) This is how you explained your motive for switching the launch pads. You did it... To fool the bomber Phoenix: You said your motive was to fool the bomber, right? Cosmos: No, by then, the bomb had already been set. Switching the launch pads after the fact would have done nothing to fool the bomber. Phoenix: (Huh? Ugh, I guess I got it wrong.) Ha ha. That was just a little joke. Now I'll tell you what you really said at the trial. Leads back to: \"This is how you explained your motive for switching the launch pads. You did it...\" To prevent the bombing Phoenix: You said your motive was to prevent the bombing, right? Cosmos: Hmph. So what you're saying is... ...that even though I switched the launch pads to prevent the bombing from happening... ...it ended up happening anyway, and I am nothing but a big fool?! Phoenix: (Well, I never said that last bit...) Ha ha. That was just a little joke. Now I'll tell you what you really said at the trial. Leads back to: \"This is how you explained your motive for switching the launch pads. You did it...\" To save the astronauts Leads to: \"Thanks to you switching the launch pads, the astronauts escaped injury from the blast.\" Phoenix: Thanks to you switching the launch pads, the astronauts escaped injury from the blast. Instead, they safely boarded the Museum's rocket, far away from the actual explosion. Cosmos: Hmph! My astronauts were raring to go out on an authentic adventure in space! How do you propose I had them board a fake rocket without them noticing?! Phoenix: ...I agree you couldn't have done it without help. For one, they would have figured it out the instant they stepped into the Space Museum. You figured you could fool Mr. Starbuck once he'd been drugged with his medication, but... ...without the help of this person, it would've been impossible to pull your plan off. Present Clay Terran profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"You must have gotten Mr. Terran to help you.\" Present anyone else Phoenix: Phoenix: It wasn't this person, was it? Cosmos: Are we done here? I'm quite busy with the aftermath of the incident, you know. Phoenix: (Oh... Guess I was right about being wrong...) ...Well, I did say it \"WASN'T this person,\" didn't I? But I still contend that... Leads back to: \"...without the help of this person, it would've been impossible to pull your plan off.\" Phoenix: You must have gotten Mr. Terran to help you. Cosmos: Urghk! Phoenix: He stole the tranquilizers from his mentor's locker and slipped them to him. And then, with Mr. Starbuck in a daze, they boarded the replica rocket in the museum! Cosmos: Aaaaagh! Someone please help this poor prisoner of war! Phoenix: (How is he able to spin around like that...?) 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: If you really wanted to save the astronauts' lives... ...shouldn't you just have called off the launch? Cosmos: If I could have done that, do you think I would have gone to all that trouble?! Phoenix: (I guess he must've had a compelling reason why he couldn't call it off...) But how did you know to switch the pads in advance of the bombing incident? Cosmos: W-Well, that's because... nrgh... I was warned in advance. Once I received that warning, it was my duty to ensure my astronauts' safety! Phoenix: But it was just a warning. It could even have been a prank. Why did you believe in it so completely? Cosmos: B-Because I went to one of those \"mediums\" that everyone's talking about these days. Phoenix: Oh? I didn't realize channeling was back in vogue. ...Besides, I thought it was you yourself that got the warning via telephone. Cosmos: Yes, that's right! The bomber contacted me personally. My battleship is equipped with a special advanced communications system, you see! Phoenix: (AKA, a regular ol' telephone.) Cosmos: \"It's been a while. Planning another launch? I see you haven't learned...\" I'll never forget the terror I felt when I received that call. Phoenix: The bomber said, \"It's been a while\"...? And that was enough to make you take the threat seriously? (Perhaps Director Cosmos took the threat so seriously... ...because the Space Center had been involved in a bombing once before? Maybe... ...the culprit in the current case is the same person who was involved in this incident!) The Courtroom No. 4 bombing Phoenix: It was the courtroom bombing, wasn't it?! That's when you were dealt a major blow! Cosmos: Do you really think blowing up a courtroom would've shaken the center of the cosmos? Phoenix: Gaaagh... (I guess I got it wrong... The director felt personally threatened, so it has to be something more relevant to him. ) Leads back to: \"...the culprit in the current case is the same person who was involved in this incident!\" The HAT-1 Miracle Leads to: \"The HAT-1 Miracle, that epic story of survival...\" The HAT-2 bombing Phoenix: The HAT-2 bombing. That must be where the answer to your secret lies. Cosmos: All hands! Ready the Galactic Scooter's main turrets! Teach this blockhead what a precision shot is all about! Phoenix: Aaaaaaagh! You got me! (Unh... I guess I was way off on that one... Now, let's see...) Leads back to: \"...the culprit in the current case is the same person who was involved in this incident!\" Phoenix: The HAT-1 Miracle, that epic story of survival... People across the nation know it now as a heroic tale of bravery. But in truth, it was an act of sabotage perpetrated by our current killer, wasn't it? Very few knew about the previous plot, so when the caller said, \"It's been a while\"... ...you knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that the danger was real, and it wasn't a prank! Cosmos: Gaaaaaaagh! Didn't anyone ever tell you to go easy on an ex-serviceman?! 1 LOCK BROKEN Cosmos: ...Yes, the HAT-1 Miracle was really a desperate battle against an act of sabotage. I even lost the life of one of my staff members in the fight. Phoenix: (Sabotage, murder... So this is the ugly truth behind the HAT-1 Miracle.) Cosmos: I let my guard down... I thought the saboteur had been caught, and that the case was closed. Phoenix: (...Huh? Wait a minute... The murder at the Space Center seven years ago...! This must be the person Director Cosmos thought was the culprit.) Present Simon Blackquill profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Simon Blackquill, the murder suspect in a case that happened here seven years ago.\" Present anyone else Phoenix: Cosmos: Mr. Lawyer, you must be very tired. Why don't you take a nap in one of our zero-gravity beds? Phoenix: (...I guess I picked the wrong person. Although I do like the sound of a zero-g nap right about now... But that will have to wait! I still have a Psyche-Lock left to break!) Leads back to: \"This must be the person Director Cosmos thought was the culprit.\" Phoenix: Simon Blackquill, the murder suspect in a case that happened here seven years ago. That place and time of the two incidents -- the murder and the sabotage -- were the same. So you thought that he committed both crimes. But while Prosecutor Blackquill was behind bars, you got another threatening call. If the culprit this time is the same as seven years ago, then it isn't Simon Blackquill. Realizing that, you were shaken. It meant the true culprit's been running free all this time. Cosmos: Ngaaagh... How do you keep seeing straight through me?! 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Switching the launch pads (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Phoenix: (The reason why Director Cosmos won't talk about why he switched the launch pads... ...is connected to the truth behind the HAT-1 Miracle. The sabotage and murder that happened at this Space Center seven years ago...) Director Cosmos, tell us what you're hiding! Cosmos: If you really want to understand the reason I decided to switch the launch pads... ...we'll have to start with the story of that horrible nightmare from seven years ago. Phoenix: Seven years ago... You mean the so-called \"HAT-1 Miracle\"? Cosmos: The launch went smoothly, but once the ship entered outer space, then the troubles began. It was all the handiwork of a certain person and their evil scheme. Phoenix: (So Mr. Starbuck's traumatic experience wasn't accidental...) Cosmos: Not only that, but before the launch, a very valuable piece of moon rock was stolen. But that wasn't the worst of it! One of my staff members was murdered! Trucy: Wow. I had no idea such awful events were behind that exciting story of space heroism... Cosmos: All that, in spite of the Space Center having very strict security in those days. All personal effects were examined thoroughly, coming or going. You couldn't even smuggle a withered old leaf through those checkpoints! Phoenix: So... do you have any clue who was responsible for the sabotage...? Cosmos: At the very least, I know it wasn't Simon Blackquill. I don't know enough to identify the true culprit, but it's clear WHAT that person is. To put it simply............ a spy. Trucy: A spy?! You mean somebody who infiltrates a foreign country... ...carries out dangerous missions, and always gets the girl?! Phoenix: (Someone's watching way too many late-night movies.) Well, I guess if we're talking about blowing up a rocket and stealing research material... ...it's not all that surprising that a spy could be behind it all. The spy (appears after \"Switching the launch pads\") Cosmos: Make no mistake! There's cutthroat rivalry between nations in the space R&D race. Some try to outdo others by any means possible, even deliberate obstructions. Seven years ago, we got a call before the launch warning us of sabotage. Phoenix: The same MO as this time... Cosmos: Yes. And here I thought the perpetrator had been caught, but it looks like I was wrong. Trucy: Prosecutor Blackquill seems more like a ninja than a spy, don'tcha think? Phoenix: (Aren't ninjas and spies basically the same thing?) Cosmos: But there's a good reason we failed to find the real spy... ...A massive cover-up by the government. Government officials were too embarrassed to admit... ...that they had allowed such a thing to happen at the hands of a spy. Phoenix: Don't tell me they made the police rush the investigation? Cosmos: They did indeed. And then, to cover up the sabotage, they cleaned up the story. Phoenix: And that was \"The HAT-1 Miracle,\" wasn't it? (But then, seven years later, the same MO -- advance warning of sabotage... That must've been the director's reason for switching the launch pads.) Just like seven years ago (appears after \"The spy\") Phoenix: Seven years ago, the spy gave you advance warning of their plans, just like this time. That was what made you decide to switch the launch pads, wasn't it? Cosmos: That's right. The caller knew the facts of the case seven years ago, despite the cover-up. They knew about the sabotage, the moon rock, the murder. And they said... ...\"You don't want things to go like they did seven years ago, do you?\" I immediately thought of calling off the launch, but the government wouldn't let me! \"We don't give in to the likes of terrorists! We must proceed for our country's honor!\" It was quite a moving speech, actually. Phoenix: (\"Moving\"? Really? Maybe if you're easily inspired by political talking points...) Cosmos: But I knew the truth. We had been warned, which meant that the danger was very real. And I knew there was no way to stop the spy. No matter what I did, they would find a way. That's why I switched the launch pads, and staged the moving rescue scene. First, I snuck into the Center the night before and switched the launch pads. That way, the astronauts would go from Boarding Lounge 1 to the Space Museum. Then, I put a \"closed for repairs\" sign at the door to Launch Pad 1 in Boarding Lounge 2. Phoenix: You did that so normal visitors wouldn't enter, right? What else did you do? Cosmos: I enlisted the help of several staff members, including Terran. Phoenix: But you didn't let Mr. Starbuck in on it? Cosmos: He'd already been through enough, and he's no good at lying to keep a secret... I'm afraid I had no choice but to have him drugged. My plan went well, until... Trucy: ...Clay's murder, huh... Cosmos: After the culprit made their escape, I switched the launch pads back. I did it in such a way that no one would find out. But after all that effort... ...Terran is dead, and the HAT-2 is destroyed! And the Hope capsule, which had returned to us only recently, was also lost in that blast! My home, the center of the cosmos... my beautiful Cosmos Space Center is done for! Phoenix: (Wait, what did he mean by the Hope capsule was lost in that blast...?) The \"Hope\" capsule (appears after \"Just like seven years ago\") Phoenix: I thought that the Hope capsule was found at the crime scene with Mr. Terran. It had just been brought back by the Hope space probe with asteroid samples inside. Phoenix: So what kind of samples are they? What's in them? Cosmos: ............The samples are scheduled for analysis in the near future. We haven't had time, since they just came back the day before Terran's murder. Cosmos: The capsule was being held in a safe in Launch Pad 1... ...but I gave it to Terran before the incident so it wouldn't be destroyed in the explosion. The idea was that, with it safely in Terran's possession... ...he could make it look like he rescued it during the staged \"miraculous escape.\" But our precious research materials... ended up lost to that explosion anyway... Trucy: But I thought Clay was supposed to keep it safe? Cosmos: You misunderstand. The launch pad explosion wasn't the one the capsule was lost to... It was lost after the police confiscated it as evidence. It was the courtroom bombing from the other day. The capsule was there in the courtroom as evidence, and was blown to smithereens! Phoenix: (Yet another casualty of that blast...) Cosmos: Ultimately, I think the culprit may have known about the switching of the launch pads. Phoenix: What? H-How? Cosmos: The police found a wiretapping device during their investigation today. A bug aboard my battleship, a tap on my advanced communications system! Phoenix: A wire on that phone? Cosmos: Yes... A wire on this very phone. I used this phone to give instructions to my staff about the launch pad switch. Just to the few select members who knew about the plan. Just before the incident, staff members were coming in and out of Launch Pad 1. The culprit probably slipped in with them amid the confusion... Phoenix: And planted the bomb then... Yes, if they were tapping your phone, they definitely could pull something like that off. So you really think the same spy is behind this incident and the one seven years ago? Cosmos: Yes. I'm sure of it. Phoenix: Then, this spy... must be the \"phantom\" Prosecutor Blackquill has been chasing... Fulbright: But Prosecutor Blackquill told me once... \"The hunt I've been on for the phantom of seven years past continues even still.\" Fulbright: For starters, that case happened right here at this very Space Center, too. Trucy: So if we can find this \"phantom\"...! Phoenix: That's right. We can clear Athena's name. And then there's the matter of Prosecutor Blackquill, too. Trucy: What about him? Phoenix: Well, IF the culprit of seven years ago is the same person as in the current incident... ...it would mean Prosecutor Blackquill is innocent. That's still an \"if,\" though... Trucy: Hmm... I wonder how dangerous that guy would be in court without handcuffs...? But if we're going on a ghost hunt, count me in! Cosmos: Hee hee hee... Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! It's all over for me! Spin! Spin! Whirl! Whirl! I'm done for! The center of the cosmos is doomed! Trucy: Do you think he's going to be all right, Daddy? Phoenix: Well, at least he'll be in good company. There must be planets out there he can spin with. Which reminds me... I'd like to delve a little deeper into the HAT-1 mission, too. Cosmos: If you want to learn more, start with the Space Museum. There's a HAT-1 exhibit there. Oh, don't mind me. I'll just keep spinning here and see how the cosmos unfolds... Trucy: It's like he achieved spiritual enlightenment or something! Phoenix: I'm sure he'll stop when he gets dizzy. Let's go visit the Space Museum! The \"Hope\" capsule (subsequent times) Phoenix: I thought that the Hope capsule was found at the crime scene with Mr. Terran. It had just been brought back by the Hope space probe with asteroid samples inside. Phoenix: So what kind of samples are they? What's in them? Cosmos: ............The samples are scheduled for analysis in the near future. We haven't had time, since they just came back the day before Terran's murder. Cosmos: The capsule was being held in a safe in Launch Pad 1... ...but I gave it to Terran before the incident so it wouldn't be destroyed in the explosion. The idea was that, with it safely in Terran's possession... ...he could make it look like he rescued it during the staged \"miraculous escape.\" But our precious research materials... ended up lost to that explosion anyway... Trucy: But I thought Clay was supposed to keep it safe? Cosmos: You misunderstand. The launch pad explosion wasn't the one the capsule was lost to... It was lost after the police confiscated it as evidence. It was the courtroom bombing from the other day. The capsule was there in the courtroom as evidence, and was blown to smithereens! Phoenix: (Yet another casualty of that blast...) Cosmos: Ultimately, I think the culprit may have known about the switching of the launch pads. Phoenix: What? H-How? Cosmos: The police found a wiretapping device during their investigation today. A bug aboard my battleship, a tap on my advanced communications system! Phoenix: A wire on that phone? Cosmos: Yes... A wire on this very phone. I used this phone to give instructions to my staff about the launch pad switch. Just to the few select members who knew about the plan. Just before the incident, staff members were coming in and out of Launch Pad 1. The culprit probably slipped in with them amid the confusion... Phoenix: And planted the bomb then... Yes, if they were tapping your phone, they definitely could pull something like that off. Present Clay's Autopsy Report or Utility Knife Cosmos: What a shame. Truly. Clay was so young... He was an outstanding man who could have contributed greatly to the future of mankind. Phoenix: He was an exceptional man, wasn't he. Cosmos: If he had gone into space, my reputation would have grown even loftier! Why did he have to die before he went into space?! Phoenix: (Someone needs to teach him he is not the literal center of the cosmos...) Space Center Pamphlet or \"Hope\" Capsule Cosmos: Mankind's crowning achievement, the HAT-1 mission, will be in textbooks across the land! Phoenix: Wow. That historic, huh? Cosmos: My achievements are grand enough to rival the very birth of space itself! My life will be a legend that will be told millions of years into the future! You may proceed to admire and praise me now! Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Phoenix: Ha ha... You certainly are an amazing piece of work. Anything else Phoenix: Excuse me, but about this piece of evidence... Cosmos: Let me ask YOU a question. What will that object contribute to the future of mankind?! Phoenix: What? Uh, not much, I guess... Cosmos: Hmph. Then how important could it be? Quite unlike the great historical figure, Yuri Cosmos! Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Phoenix: (If he's any more self-absorbed, he'll turn into his very own black hole.) Before clearing \"The \"Hope\" capsule\" Talk option in Cosmos Space Center - Entrance: December 20Cosmos Space Center - Space Museum Trucy: Wow... The place is crawling with cops. Phoenix: Looks like we won't get any investigating done here now. Let's come back later. After clearing \"The \"Hope\" capsule\" Talk option in Cosmos Space Center - Entrance: December 20Cosmos Space Center - Space Museum Trucy: Let's see... Where's the exhibit on the launch seven years ago...? Phoenix: There, that's the HAT-1 exhibit. Trucy: Oh, wow! Look at that photo of the team! Phoenix: There's Clay, and Mr. Starbuck, Director Cosmos, Aura Blackquill, and even Ponco. ...But I've never seen the woman on the right before. Trucy: Everybody looks so happy! ...Well, except for Director Cosmos. Phoenix: Let's check out the newspaper article, too. \"HAT-1 Launch Imminent\"... And there's a photo of the Hope space probe. I guess it's only natural it doesn't talk about the murder or the sabotage. Trucy: They really were keeping it a secret, just like the director said. Daddy, take a look at that jacket... Phoenix: It must be the HAT-1 team's uniform jacket. It's the same design as the one Apollo was wearing, the one that belonged to Clay. Trucy: \"Actual jacket worn by a HAT-1 team member,\" it says. Phoenix: Not a replica, huh? (I wonder if it was Mr. Starbuck's?) HAT-1 Exhibit added to the Court Record. ???: Hello...? Phoenix: Oh, Ms. Woods! What brings you here? Woods: I... I heard Thena got arrested, so I... ...I've been looking for you, Mr. Wright. I thought you might be here... at the scene... Phoenix: You must be so worried! But rest assured. I'm going to do my very best to defend her. Woods: Thena's going through such a hard time. I hope she doesn't lose heart. Even just coming back to this place must've been really difficult for her... Phoenix: Huh? You mean the Cosmos Space Center? Woods: What, you didn't know...? She used to live here, when she was a little girl. Phoenix: Sh-She did?! No, I didn't know... (No wonder she knew so much...) Ms. Woods, could you tell me more, in detail? Talk Athena and the Space Center Woods: Thena's mom worked here. If I remember right, she was a doctor of psychology, or something like that... Phoenix: But why was a psychology specialist working at a space research facility? Woods: I don't really know. But I do know that she lived and worked here, so Thena lived here, too. Phoenix: So it was far from Athena's first time here. I wonder why she didn't mention it? Woods: She probably didn't want to talk about it. This place is connected to a very sad memory for her. Sad memory (appears after \"Athena and the Space Center\") Phoenix: A sad memory...? Can you tell me about it? Woods: There was a terrible incident here... It was seven years ago. Phoenix: (The same time frame as the HAT-1 launch...) Woods: Thena's mom... In the robotics lab... She was... murdered... Trucy: Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaat?! Woods: After it happened, Thena stopped coming to school. Phoenix: (Poor Athena... And all this time, she never let on at all...) Woods: I was so worried about her! I came here so many times, hoping to see her... But I never saw her again. Woods: After a while, we started exchanging letters... ...but I didn't get to see her face-to-face for seven long years. Phoenix: And so the first time you'd seen her in seven years was during Prof. Courte's case? Woods: That's right. And I was so surprised! She was like a completely different person, so cheerful and happy! Young Athena (appears after \"Sad memory\") Phoenix: What was Athena like as a child? Woods: She was very sensitive and kind. She didn't talk very much. She liked to draw and paint at home. Trucy: That's completely different from the Athena we know now. I can't even picture it... Woods: She never left the Space Center much because... ...she was very sensitive to other people's emotions. When she went to crowded places, she'd get dizzy from all the emotions flying around. Phoenix: (It must be hard to hear people's hearts as well as their voices...) Woods: She always wore these big, heavy-looking headphones. She said her mother made them for her, as part of her research. Phoenix: (Huh. I wonder what kind of research it was?) Woods: Because of her special ability, Thena couldn't handle being in school very often. And I was always out sick because of my weak constitution. Maybe that's why we became such good friends. We used to play together here at the Space Center a lot. It brings back memories. Trucy: Sounds like Athena's mother played a big role here at the Space Center. Ooh! Daddy, show her that picture! Phoenix: (Atta girl! Good idea.) Present HAT-1 Exhibit (after clearing \"Young Athena\" Talk option) Leads to: \"Ms. Woods, could you take a look at this for me?\" Anything else Woods: I'm very sorry, but I don't know anything about that... *cough* *cough, cough* Phoenix: Ack! Okay! Sorry to bother you! (I guess she doesn't have leads on that.) Phoenix: Ms. Woods, could you take a look at this for me? Woods: Oh, look! There's Thena's mom! The woman on the far right, the one in the kimono. That's Dr. Metis Cykes. Phoenix: Athena's mother's murder... ...did it by any chance have any connection to the HAT-1 launch? Woods: What? Why, yes... it did. As I recall, it happened on the day before the launch. Phoenix: Just as I suspected... Cosmos: But that wasn't the worst of it! One of my staff members was murdered! Phoenix: (So this is the murder Director Cosmos was talking about... Does that mean that the crime Prosecutor Blackquill was convicted of... ...is the murder of Athena's mother...?) There's a chance her death is somehow connected to the current case. Woods: Th-There is? Phoenix: Thank you for all your help, Ms. Woods. And please, try not to worry. I won't let anything happen to Athena. Woods: Thank you, Mr. Wright! I know you'll take good care of her. Trucy: So we need to investigate the robotics lab, and also talk to Athena. We've got our plates full, Daddy. I hope we can fit it all in before the day is through... Phoenix: The Detention Center first, then. We have to see Athena before visiting hours are over! December 20Detention Center - Visitor's Room Fulbright: Well! If it isn't Mr. Lawyer! Fancy meeting you here! Phoenix: Oh, hello, Detective Fulbright. Here on business? Fulbright: To tell the truth, I'm here to interview Ted Tonate! Phoenix: The one behind the courtroom bombing incident?! Fulbright: He suddenly said he's ready to tell the truth about that case! And what he was saying was so incredible, I just had to come right over to hear more. Trucy: Incredible? What was he saying? Fulbright: Why don't you hang around and hear it for yourself? Phoenix: ...Really? Us? Are you sure? Fulbright: Ha ha ha! I give you my special permission! Here comes the bomber now! Tonate: YOU! WHAT NERVE YOU HAVE TO COME HERE! YOU'RE HERE TO LAUGH AT ME, I SUPPOSE?! Phoenix: (Like I'd waste my breath on you. After all, you're the one who assaulted Apollo and put him in the hospital!) Tonate: VIOLENCE -> NO QUESTION -> OK Phoenix: \"No violence\"?! Too bad Apollo didn't get a chance to say that before you attacked him! Tonate: I... I... Phoenix: Fine. Then just answer me this, Mr. Tonate. What is this \"truth\" of yours about the courtroom you blew up? Tonate: NO! I DIDN'T DO IT! I DIDN'T BLOW UP THE COURTROOM! WHEN I KILLED DETECTIVE ARME, THERE WAS ANOTHER PERSON IN THE ROOM! Trucy: Wh... What are you talking about?! Who else could've been there?! Tonate: I SAW IT, I TELL YOU! I SAW SOMEONE'S HAND AS THEY WERE STEALING THE REMOTE SWITCH! THIS PERSON WAS THERE AND WITNESSED THE MURDER I COMMITTED! Phoenix: Wh-What?! Tonate: I DON'T KNOW WHO IT WAS... ...But that's who blew up the courtroom! Trucy: You expect us to buy that?! Phoenix: Easy there, Trucy... I don't see any Psyche-Locks... ...so I guess he must not be lying. Tonate: PARDON ME. I GOT A LITTLE CARRIED AWAY. BUT I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH. I DID NOT DETONATE THAT BOMB. Fulbright: And there you have it. We can't exactly ignore his claims, of course, so we're going a follow-up. We're even analyzing the bomb itself, or what's left of it! We haven't found any new facts yet, though. Phoenix: (Wow. They've laid it all out, piece by piece...) Tonate: OH, LOOK AT ALL THOSE BEAUTIFUL LITTLE PIECES! I... I WISH I COULD HAVE THEM... Phoenix: (Uh-oh. Looks like his geek switch has been activated...) Phony Phanty Bomb added to the Court Record. Fulbright: Well, I hope you're ready for Prosecutor Blackquill's special brand of questioning! Tonate: AAAGH... ANYTHING BUT THAT...! Fulbright: I'm afraid I have to be off now, too! I was just about to question Ms. Cykes. Trucy: You're going to see Athena now? Fulbright: That's right... Oh, did you folks come to see her? Sorry for the trouble, but could you come back later? Well, off I go! Phoenix: (What bad timing... Looks like we'll have to wait until after her questioning is over to see her.) Trucy: And after we came all this way, too! Well, I guess it's back to the Space Center. Let's go check out the robotics lab, Daddy. Phoenix: All right. Sounds like a plan. Present Phony Phanty Bomb Trucy: Hey! It's Phony Phanty! Phoenix: You know this character? Trucy: Yeah, it's the craze at my school, too. Phoenix: (I had no idea this thing was so popular.) Trucy: There are two camps: the Bum Rap Rhiny fans, and the Phony Phanty fans. Which side are you on, Daddy? Phoenix: Well, as a lawyer, I'd like to avoid both of them if I can help it. Entrance Present HAT-1 Exhibit Cosmos: Mankind's crowning achievement, the HAT-1 mission, will be in textbooks across the land! Phoenix: Wow. That historic, huh? Cosmos: My achievements are grand enough to rival the very birth of space itself! My life will be a legend that will be told millions of years into the future! You may proceed to admire and praise me now! Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Phoenix: Ha ha... You certainly are an amazing piece of work. Boarding Lounge Present HAT-1 Exhibit Starbuck: The HAT-1 mission experienced one crisis after another. It was almost like space itself was rejecting our efforts. That's what it felt like, anyway. Phoenix: But, in the end, the mission was a success. Starbuck: Yeah. People call it a \"miracle\"... ...but I think it was us who made it work somehow, through sheer will and hope. Phoenix: (A miracle through sheer will, huh? I think I know what he means all too well...) Space Museum Present HAT-1 Exhibit Phoenix: Ms. Woods, could you take a look at this for me? Woods: Oh, look! There's Thena's mom! The woman on the far right, the one in the kimono. That's Dr. Metis Cykes. Phoenix: Athena's mother's murder... ...did it by any chance have any connection to the HAT-1 launch? Woods: What? Why, yes... it did. As I recall, it happened on the day before the launch. Phoenix: Just as I suspected... Cosmos: But that wasn't the worst of it! One of my staff members was murdered! Phoenix: (So this is the murder Director Cosmos was talking about... Does that mean that the crime Prosecutor Blackquill was convicted of... ...is the murder of Athena's mother...?) There's a chance her death is somehow connected to the current case. Woods: Th-There is? December 20Cosmos Space Center - Robotics Lab Trucy: So this is the robotics lab, huh? Looks like it's exactly one floor above the boarding lounge. Phoenix: (...And where people were directed to evacuate from via the emergency ladder. This is where Athena's mother was killed seven years ago...) Speaking of someone who works with robots... Trucy: Daddy, look! Over there! Apollo: So they planned to use this bag to carry the capsule, is that right? Aura: Yeah, more or less. ...Say, why don't we stop talking about the case and have a nice cup of tea instead? Phoenix: (Apollo and Aura Blackquill? I wonder what they're talking about?) Aura: Well, well. Come to spoil our fun? Just when I was enjoying our alone time... Apollo: Trucy! And... Mr. Wright. Aura: If it's Apollo you want, you can't have him. He said he's investigating on his own. Phoenix: And I respect his wishes. We just came to investigate this lab. Aura: Well, this is MY lab, so you'll need MY permission if you want to do any snooping. Talk About what happened Aura: I heard about the trial. You made mincemeat out of the director. And suddenly Starbuck was out and your little subordinate, the princess, was in. Case closed. And they all lived happily ever after! Ha ha ha! Trucy: Grrrrr! Daddy, say something to her! Aura: And I suppose you're going to defend the princess in court, am I right? Phoenix: (\"The princess,\" huh? Guess she's talking about Athena...) Of course! Athena is innocent. Aura: Oh, my. Such loyalty and trust! She seems pretty suspicious to me, though. The emotionally unstable princess. There's your culprit for you. Don't you agree, Apollo? Apollo: I... I don't know yet. Trucy: Apollo! How could you?! Aura: What's wrong with saying \"I don't know\" if it's true? It's a very scientific approach. Your subordinate is more level-headed than you... Or should I say, \"former subordinate\"? Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: ............ Phoenix: (I can't believe it... Does Apollo really suspect Athena?!) Aura: ...Phew. All this laughing has worn me out. Your turn to say something, Hunk of Junk. Clonco: ............ Mr. Terran, you look pale. Shall I help you to the sickbay? Phoenix: \"Mr. Terran\"...? But that's Apollo you're talking to... Aura: Oh, this Hunk of Junk here is mistaking Apollo for Clay. Maybe Apollo is possessed by Clay's ghost. Clonco: Mr. Terran, how are you injuries? Mr. T-T-Terraaaaan... ...Mr. T-T-Terran, h-h-how are your injuries? Mr. T-T-Terraaaaaaaaaaaaaaan... Aura: I guess Clay intends to hang around to haunt the princess that murdered him. Oh, and to haunt the lawyer that defends her, too, of course. Phoenix: (A robot that can see ghosts? Yeah, right! And I'M a spirit medium!) Sorry, but apparently, scientists just don't tell very frightening ghost stories. I intend to defend Athena, no matter what you have to say about it. Aura: How perfectly foolish! That kind of blind belief makes people lose sight of the truth. ...Just like seven years ago. Seven years ago (appears after \"About what happened\") Phoenix: Could you tell me about the incident seven years ago? Aura: Why? Do you enjoy trampling on people's feelings and rubbing salt in their wounds? Or do you just want me to talk? Hmm, in that case, what should I ask for in return...? Apollo: I'd like to hear about that incident, too. It'd help me understand the current case better. Phoenix: (Huh? Apollo knows about that case, too...?) Aura: Well, if you're the one who's asking, Apollo... Come on, Hunk of Junk. You tell the story. Clonco: But Miss Aura, that's private information... Aura: Tsk! If you won't talk, I'll just have to make you talk! Clonco: G...Gaaagh! ...Yes! Who cares about personal privacy?! Not me! I am ready to utilize my blast processing abilities to impart all available information! Trucy: Wow, what a magic trick! He's like a completely different robot now! Clonco: The bodies of all the robots that come through this lab are designed by Miss Aura! I was born seven years ago! Miss Aura was much, much younger then! Phoenix: (Y-Yikes! Better watch what you say if you don't want to get recycled, Clonco!) Clonco: And then our hearts were created by that great genius, Dr. Metis Cykes! Phoenix: Hearts? Robots with hearts? Can you even make such a thing? Clonco: Emotions are not irrational things! Our logic and our hearts can be integrated! The two Navigation Companions created by Miss Aura and Dr. Metis transcend humans! Gaaagh! Aura: Metis... Phoenix: (Huh? She just glanced over at her desk.) Aura: Nobody could continue Metis's research. She and her work were truly one of a kind. And now the two Navigation Companions are all that are left of Metis here on Earth... Phoenix: (The robots are all that's left? Isn't she leaving out a very important someone...?) Aura: We built the ultimate creations together, but now she's gone! Apollo: I get the feeling Dr. Cykes loved her robots almost as much as she loved her daughter... ...and almost as much as she loved you. Aura: ...Ha ha ha ha ha! What are you talking about? Don't make me laugh! But you lost someone, too, didn't you, Apollo? Your friend Clay... I guess you and I are pretty much in the same boat. *sigh* Clonco: Miss Aura, would you like a tissue? Aura: Keep your trap shut, Hunk of Junk! Clonco and Ponco (appears after \"Seven years ago\") Trucy: Clonco is an important keepsake of your time with Dr. Cykes. You should treat him better! Aura: What does it matter? He doesn't feel pain, and I can always repair his body. Besides, their hearts aren't actually in their bodies. Phoenix: What do you mean by that? Aura: The program Metis wrote runs on a separate mainframe. Their bodies are controlled remotely from there. Their hearts and memories are there, too. These bodies are really just peripherals. So I can do anything I want to them! Phoenix: (I'm not so sure that gives you the right to physically abuse the poor things...) Aura: But why are you people looking into such an old case now, anyway? Phoenix: Well... we believe the culprit of that incident might be the same person as in this case. Trucy: So Daddy's going to find out who killed Dr. Cykes, too! (Changed from [So Dadddy's [sic] going to find out who killed Dr. Cykes, too!] in the original release) Aura: ............ I'm sure you're aware of who Metis's killer is? Phoenix: Yes, Prosecutor Blackquill... or so it seems. Aura: That's a quaint way of putting it. Are you implying you don't think he did it? Phoenix: I can't say anything for sure right now. But that's exactly why I'd like to hear your side of it, to help me be sure. Dr. Cykes and Simon (appears after \"Clonco and Ponco\") Leads to: \"I was the one who introduced Simon to Metis, you know.\" Present Space Center Pamphlet Aura: I actually don't have any interest in space. The only thing I'm interested in is robotics! I love robots! Clonco: Oh, Miss Aura! I didn't realize you felt that way about me! Gaaagh! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Aura: The kind of robots I want to make aren't rusty pieces of scrap like you! I want to create giant robots! I've actually been working on a project for a while now. Phoenix: (I shudder to think what uses she might put giant robots to...) Aura's Statement Aura: I have nothing else to say to you. Phoenix: (Okay. Guess she has nothing else to say to me.) Clonco: I apologize for Miss Aura. Phoenix: It's all right, Clonco. There's nothing for you to apologize about. Anything else Phoenix: Can you tell me anything about this piece of evidence? Aura: Even if I could, I wouldn't tell a filthy lawyer like you. Phoenix: What a... pleasant response. Aura: I was the one who introduced Simon to Metis, you know. He wanted to learn psychology, he said, to give himself an edge in court. Phoenix: Ah, Prosecutor Blackquill's forte... his infamous \"power of suggestion\" technique. Aura: Exactly. And he was oddly serious about it. Rather than a teacher/student relationship... ...he treated her more like how a loyal samurai would treat his sovereign. Phoenix: (Huh. He seems more like a lost soul than a dignified samurai to me...) Aura: He even got along well with that miserable little princess. Trucy: Why do you call Athena \"the princess,\" anyway? Aura: Well, she is Metis's daughter, after all, although she's nothing like her. Besides... ...doesn't the selfish little princess always have lots of white knights hanging around? Phoenix: (Now I think I see why Athena didn't say anything when we ran into Aura yesterday. It all makes sense now.) Aura: So the culprit behind the two cases could be the same, huh...? That settles it, then. Phoenix: What does it settle? Aura: None of your business. Just forget you heard anything. How long are you people going to hand around in here, anyway? Trucy: What? But we came here to take a look around... Aura: You think you can just waltz in and ransack a person's lab? Show me a search warrant! Phoenix: Uh, we're not the police, so we don't have one... Aura: Then get out. Now! Clonco, show them out! Clonco: C-Certainly, Miss Aura! Trucy: Ouch! Don't push! Clonco: My apologies! I'm just following orders! Phoenix: Aaaaagh...! December 20Cosmos Space Center - Entrance Phoenix: What a way to get shown out... Trucy: The nerve of that woman! What's with that horrible attitude?! Phoenix: I guess that's just how she is. Trucy: And why was Apollo going along with her? Phoenix: (I guess it's because they have something in common... Apollo lost Clay, just like how Aura lost Dr. Cykes.) Trucy: *sigh*... I'm really worried about him. He's not himself at all. He's usually not all cool and dark and mysterious like that! Phoenix: I guess that's true... (Does she mean he's usually silly and dorky?) Trucy: I'm going to go keep an eye on him! Phoenix: Hey, wait! Trucy! Come back! ............ (She's gone. Hmm... What should I do now? Detective Fulbright is probably still questioning Athena. Guess I'll go back to the office... alone. *sigh*) December 20Wright Anything Agency Phoenix: (Well, here I am... This office has never felt so... empty.) I guess I haven't been here at the office all by myself in a long time. *sigh* (When I first became a lawyer, my mentor was here with me... And then, for a while after that, she was always by my side. (Changed from [And, after that, there was always someone by my side.] in the original release) Now I'm getting all sentimental. I must be tired...) Huh? There's something on the floor... What's a letter doing here? \"Hey, Nick! It's been a while, huh? Miss me?\" (I know this handwriting!) I read somewhere that you were holding a trial in the middle of an exploding courtroom? That must've really been something, although weird is par for the course with you. Phoenix: (I think she, or whatever paper she's reading is a little off on the details...) I'd love to come visit, but I'm right in the middle of a difficult part in my training. So instead, think of me as you watch those Steel Samurai videos I sent. I'm sure they'll cheer you right up! Phoenix: ...Yours truly, Maya Fey. (Good ol' Maya. It's as if she knew I was feeling down and needed a lift.) Maya was my assistant for quite a while. Believe it or not, but she's a spirit medium. This Magatama I use on Psyche-Locks... Maya is the one who gave it to me. But I wonder how this letter got here? ???: ...Um, Mr. Nick...? Phoenix: AAAAAAAAAAAGH! ???: Eeeeeeeeeeeeek! Phoenix: Oh, it's you, Pearls! Talk Pearls Pearl: How have you been, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: This is Pearl Fey, though I call her \"Pearls.\" She is Maya's cousin, who is also a spirit medium. A very talented one, at that. I've known her since she was eight years old. But Apollo and Athena only met her a few months ago. Phoenix: You didn't come all this way just to bring me a letter, did you? Pearl: I apologize for barging in. The door was unlocked... But I can't believe there was a big explosion here! Your office doesn't look any different. Phoenix: (She's even further off on the details than Maya.) I wish I could take you out to eat or something, Pearls, but there's a lot going on... Pearl: Oh, I knew that! I didn't come here for a social visit, you know, Mr. Nick! Pearls's errand (appears after \"Pearls\") Pearl: Did you read the postscript on the letter? Phoenix: Huh? There's more? ...Oh, yeah. Here it is. \"P.S.\" I bet you've been too busy to clean or take care of the office. So Pearly said she would come help you! Isn't she sweet? You'd better thank her! Phoenix: Oh, so that's what you're doing here. That's awfully nice of you, Pearls. (Maya and Pearls. Thanks to these two... ...I'm starting to feel a little better. Thank you, girls.) Pearl: Now that I'm here, I'm going to whip this place into shape! You just concentrate on your work and don't mind me at all! Phoenix: (I'll need to talk to Prosecutor Blackquill if I want to learn more about his case. With the trial still going on, they must be holding him down at the Detention Center.) What to do (appears after \"Pearls's errand\") Pearl: Has it been a while since you've seen Mystic Maya? Phoenix: Yes, quite a while. She used to drop by the office sometimes to say hello... ...but she hasn't been by recently. I wonder what she's up to these days? Pearl: To become a spirit medium worthy of heading the Fey clan, she undergoes rigorous training. But she says she's growing really tired of the vegetarian diet! Phoenix: I'll have to have some burgers delivered to her, then. Pearl: Oh! I'm sure she would love that! But to get where she is, the delivery person would have to climb a steep mountain. Phoenix: ............I hope she tips them well, then. Any ideas? (appears after \"Pearls's errand\") Pearl: Your hair is nice and spiky today, as always, Mr. Nick. Phoenix: Thanks. I generally try to look good if I'm going to be in court. Pearl: Do you make it spiky so that the prosecution will feel intimidated? Phoenix: Huh? No, that's not exactly my intention... Pearl: Your hairstyle is to make you look bigger and stronger, just like a rooster's comb, right? That's what Mystic Maya says, anyway. Phoenix: She couldn't compare it to something cool, like a lion's mane? Present Attorney's Badge Pearl: Hee hee. When I see you wearing your attorney's badge like that... ...it brings back such memories. Phoenix: I remember you helping me conduct my investigations from time to time. Pearl: I'm glad I can help again! Phoenix: Thanks. You always provide such great assistance. Pearl: I'll do my best to live up to Mystic Maya's standard! Phoenix: (I don't know what I'd do if Pearls wasn't here right now.) Space Center Pamphlet Pearl: Is that a pamphlet? I just love to look at pamphlets! Phoenix: I bet you find vacation pamphlets especially exciting, huh? Pearl: Yes, because I don't get a chance to leave the village much, what with my training. So looking at pamphlets is kind of like a hobby. Phoenix: Well, the office is just full of them. You can have as many of them as you'd like. Pearl: Oh, boy! Thank you! Phoenix: (Poor kid. I wish I could take her on a real vacation.) Phony Phanty Bomb Pearl: Hee hee! What a cute little elephant. Phoenix: It used to have a bomb in it, you know. Pearl: Oh, my! A bomb in its stomach? Phoenix: Ha ha ha. It must've been starving, huh? You'd have to be pretty hungry to want to eat a bomb. Pearl: And there must not have been anything else around to eat. ...You have to be careful never to eat anything strange yourself, Mr. Nick. Phoenix: Ha ha ha. I promise. (She looks genuinely worried for me.) Anything else Pearl: I'm sorry. I want to be of help... ...but I'm still in training, and... ...nothing about that is coming to mind, I'm afraid. I'm really, deeply sorry. Phoenix: No, no, no. It's okay. I shouldn't have shown you something so trivial anyway. (I feel like we've had this conversation before...) After clearing \"Pearls's errand\" Talk option in Wright Anything Agency: December 20Detention Center - Visitor's Room Phoenix: (Well, look who's here... I wonder what they're talking about?) ???: All this time and you haven't said a word. It's even turning your hair gray! Blackquill: I don't have anything to say, Aura. Why don't you go home and play with your dolls? Phoenix: (Prosecutor Blackquill!) Aura: Well, even if you don't, I have plenty, you jerk! Fulbright: M-Ms. Blackquill, don't you think that's enough for today? Aura: \"Enough for today\"?! Today is all there is when there's no tomorrow! Phoenix: (\"When there's no tomorrow\"? What is she talking about?) Blackquill: We have company, Aura. Please try to calm down. Aura: All right, fine. I see you're just not going to listen, no matter what I say. I've had it. If that's the way you're going to be, I have another plan up my sleeve. I hope you're happy, Simon, because I'm done! Do as you please! See if I care! Fulbright: Ugh... Phoenix: (Wow... I could cut the tension with a katana...) Blackquill: Wright-dono. It looks like Fool Bright saved your case in court this morning. Phoenix: What? ...Oh. Yeah, he did. (You bounced back to business quick!) Fulbright: P-Prosecutor Blackquill, forgive me! But it was the just thing to do! Blackquill: But, as a result, Cykes-dono was arrested. Was that the just thing to do, too? Fulbright: Mr. Lawyer, I'm sorry! But it was evidence. What else could I do? Phoenix: Don't worry about it. I plan to defend her and prove her innocence. Blackquill: I wouldn't take things so lightly, if I were you, Wright-dono! Phoenix: (...Th-This is bladeproof glass, right...?) Talk Seven years ago Leads to: \"Prosecutor Blackquill, we're looking into the case from seven years ago.\" Present Attorney's Badge Blackquill: ...How can you call yourself a lawyer if you can't even protect your own subordinate? Phoenix: Ungh... I swear I'll get her acquitted! You'll see! Blackquill: Your mind must be as dense as the hair on your head. Do you really think it will be so easy? Phoenix: (I'm more than aware of how hard it's going to be, thank you very much!) Anything else Blackquill: ............ Phoenix: ............So............ what do you think? Blackquill: ............ Phoenix: (Looks like it wasn't important enough to warrant even a contemptuous \"Hmph\"...) Phoenix: Prosecutor Blackquill, we're looking into the case from seven years ago. You're looking for somebody you call \"the phantom of seven years past,\" aren't you? Blackquill: You villain! Where did you hear about that?! Phoenix: (...Th-This glass is absolutely, positively bladeproof... right...?) Fulbright: No! It wasn't me! I didn't say a single w-- ...Oops. Phoenix: Ouch. (At least it wasn't my fault!) Blackquill: ............ Phoenix: Could you tell me who this \"phantom\" is? And also, you didn't really kill Dr. Cykes, did you...? Blackquill: Guard! The guest is leaving! Phoenix: Prosecutor Blackquill! Please listen to me! The culprit in the current case might be the same as the one in the case seven years ago! If you would cooperate, we could probably solve both cases! Blackquill: ............Hmph. I suppose I could talk. The one who killed my mentor was, without question, me. I stole Cykes-dono's mother away from her. I destroyed her life! Phoenix: (Prosecutor Blackquill...) Blackquill: Guard! Where are you? Stop dragging your feet, I tell you! Phoenix: ............There he goes. Fulbright: Noooooooooooooooooooooo! We've upset Prosecutor Blackquill! Now what are we going to do, Mr. Lawyer?! Phoenix: (There isn't much we CAN do...) ...Detective Fulbright? Do you mind if I ask you just a little more about that old case? Fulbright: Well, I guess it won't make any difference now... What would you like to know? Talk The trial seven years ago Phoenix: Do you know anything about the trial that got him convicted? Fulbright: A little. The police call the incident the UR-1 Incident. Prosecutor Blackquill was charged with murdering his psychology mentor. ...Kind of like if your red Mr. Lawyer were to kill you. Phoenix: (I don't want to think about that one.) Fulbright: There were two decisive pieces of evidence, so a verdict was reached very quickly. Phoenix: Two pieces of evidence, huh. What were they? Fulbright: Let's see! The first was some security camera footage. He was the only one who used the corridor to the murder scene at the time of the crime. Phoenix: The only one, huh? (Ouch. That does sound pretty decisive...) Could you show me that footage? Fulbright: Oh, sorry. I don't have it with me right now. Phoenix: (I guess I'll have to see it some other time.) Seven-Year-Old Video added to the Court Record. Phoenix: And what was the second piece of evidence? Fulbright: This one's even more incriminating. A photo of the moment of the crime. See? There he is at the crime scene, holding a bloody katana. It was the victim's, kept on display in the room. She had a thing for Japanese culture. Phoenix: W-Wow... (It'd be hard to explain this one away...) Katana added to the Court Record. Phoenix: But who took this picture, Detective? Fulbright: The incident happened the day before the HAT-1 launch. A reporter who had come to do a story on the launch was in the room across from the lab. This just happened to show up in one of the pictures he took. Photo of the Crime added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (Prosecutor Blackquill's attitude earlier was so odd... He's definitely hiding something.) Prosecutor Blackquill said he was hunting a phantom from seven years ago, didn't he? Fulbright: Yes. And I imagine it's getting more and more urgent as his execution date approaches. Phoenix: Wh-What did you just say? Execution date...? Fulbright: What? Did I say something?! Never mind me! You didn't hear a thing! The trial seven years ago (subsequent times) Phoenix: Do you know anything about the trial that got him convicted? Fulbright: A little. The police call the incident the UR-1 Incident. Prosecutor Blackquill was charged with murdering his psychology mentor. ...Kind of like if your red Mr. Lawyer were to kill you. Phoenix: (I don't want to think about that one.) Fulbright: There were two decisive pieces of evidence, so a verdict was reached very quickly. Phoenix: Two pieces of evidence, huh. What were they?

Phoenix: Wh-What did you just say? Execution date...? Fulbright: What? Did I say something?! Never mind me! You didn't hear a thing! Execution date (appears after \"The trial seven years ago\") Leads to: \"So he was given... the death sentence...\" Present Anything Fulbright: Something for the lost and found? I'll be sure to take care of it! Phoenix: No, no, no! this is an important piece of evidence! Phoenix: So he was given... the death sentence... Fulbright: Yes. He told me not to tell you people, actually... ...but I guess there's no sense hiding it anymore. His execution date is tomorrow. Phoenix: What?! Tomorrow?! (No...) Fulbright: M-Ms. Blackquill, don't you think that's enough for today? Aura: \"Enough for today\"?! Today is all there is when there's no tomorrow! Phoenix: But what if the culprit of the current case is the same as the one from seven years ago? Fulbright: Then it would be the worst possible scenario... Prosecutor Blackquill would be executed tomorrow under a false charge. Phoenix: But that would be unthinkable! We have to do something... right now! Fulbright: Nnnnngh! I want to do something... I want to, but... You're a lawyer! You know how hard it is to overturn a decision! Phoenix: I know! But why?! Why isn't Prosecutor Blackquill putting up any kind of a fight? Fulbright: You saw how he was, right? He's been like that ever since his conviction. Totally uncooperative. Not even his own sister could persuade him! Phoenix: (Uncooperative... when he's about to be executed for a crime he didn't commit?! This isn't right...! I can't let it happen! I have to stop it somehow!) Fulbright: ...Oh, pardon me! Looks like I have a phone call. Fulbright here. What? What's happening?! YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING! Phoenix: (That's quite a reaction. I bet he's making some big show of it right now.) Fulbright: M-M-Mr. Lawyer! The robots...! The robots are...! Phoenix: Detective Fulbright, get a hold of yourself. Some kind of robot malfunction? Fulbright: Not a malfunction. They're staging a revolt! The machines are rebelling against humans! They've holed themselves up in the Space Center and taken the visitors as hostages! Phoenix: They did WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! (No... Trucy!) Fulbright: We have to get right over there! This is going to be one heck of a battle! December 20Cosmos Space Center - Entrance Phoenix: (The riot police are here. Then, the robots really are holding people hostage?!) Fulbright: Hm? Look, Mr. Lawyer! What do you suppose that group of people are swarmed around?! Clonco: But I was only trying to help this nice person! She said she was lost... Man: You robots have declared war on us humans! You've even taken hostages already! Woman: Stay away from it! You never know what it'll do! ???: But he's not a bad robot! Can't you see he's just trying to help me?! Phoenix: I recognize that voice! Detective Fulbright, are you okay here on your own? Fulbright: Leave it to me! ...All right, people! What's going on here? Phoenix: Pearls! Over here! Pearl: Oh, Mr. Nick! There you are! I heard the terrible news, and I got so worried! Phoenix: Thanks, Pearls. I can hardly believe what's happening myself... Clonco: I'm so glad you found each other! When people are happy, I am happy! Phoenix: (Clonco seems to be the same as before.) Clonco: When people are sad, I am happy! When people are angry... When people are... Oh, did I say some thiiing oddd...? Diiiiiiiiid IIII ERROR Phoenix: Uh-oh! (There IS something wrong with him!) Clonco: Gaaagh! ...*whir* Pearl: It looks like he fell asleep. He must've been tired. Clonco: Hee hee hee... Ha ha ha ha ha.... Phoenix: Um, Clonco? ???: Ha ha ha! Human beings are our enemies! It's time for the machines to take over! Phoenix: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! (The robots are rebelling!) Woman: Everybody, run! Eeeeeeeeeek! Man: It's an all-out war! It's the end of the world! ???: Ha ha ha ha ha! Fools! How could you fall for something so cliché?! I'm human, too, you idiots! I'm just controlling these robots remotely! Phoenix: (Wh-What?!) ???: {{Color|olive|But it IS true that I've taken hostages, so you better not make me mad. ...Hey, you! Hostage number one! Come here. I'll let you talk to them. (Changed from [...Hey, you! Hostage 1! Come here. I'll let you talk to them.] in the original release) Phoenix: (Huh? There's something being displayed on Clonco's face screen.) It's... the Space Museum! Trucy: ...Daddy? Daddy, is that you? Phoenix: Trucy? Trucy, is that you?! No... Trucy, are you all right?! Trucy: About fifteen robots are holding twelve of us hostage, Daddy! They've gone haywire! A researcher is the one behind it! She's here con-- Eeeeeeek! ???: Grrr! This girl talks too much! Phoenix: Trucy! Trucy! Talk to me!!! Pearl: Why are you doing this?! ???: I'm glad you asked. My demand is simple! I hope that detective is listening! Fulbright: Bobby Fulbright, here! I'm all ears! ???: I want you to bring someone to me: Clay Terran's murderer, Athena Cykes. Phoenix: (Athena...?) Fulbright: N-Now hold on just one moment! I can't just give in to a demand like that! ???: So you don't care what happens to these hostages, huh? I'll just pick one out, then...! Fulbright: N-No! Wait! Gaaagh! M-M-Mr. Lawyer! I know I have absolutely no right to make such a ridiculous request, but... Phoenix: But you need me to buy some time, right? Got it. I'll see what I can do. But promise me... Promise me you'll never hand Athena over, and you won't give up on the hostages, either. Fulbright: O-Of course I won't! Now, I'd better go contact headquarters! Pearl: Mr. Nick, how do you plan to buy time? Phoenix: (I have no idea yet. But this hostage-taker... Could it be...?) ???: If you don't bring me that little princess, I'll have Hunk of Junk kill all the hostages! Phoenix: (\"Princess\"...? \"Hunk of Junk\"...? There's only one person this could be... ...in which case, there must be something I can use as a bargaining chip!) Blackquill: I don't have anything to say, Aura. Why don't you go home and play with your dolls? Phoenix: (Prosecutor Blackquill!) Aura: Well, even if you don't, I have plenty, you jerk! Phoenix: ............ Ms. Hostage-Taker, Athena is not a murderer. ???: What are you talking about? She's been arrested and they've got her in detention! Phoenix: I'm telling you the truth. Look, the person you want is the real killer, right? Well, it's NOT Athena. It's someone else. ???: All right, let's hear your stupid little theory. Who is this \"real killer\"? Phoenix: I don't know yet. But the culprit is the same as the one in the case from seven years ago. The UR-1 Incident... I believe you have a personal interest in that case? ???: Hmph. It's too late to change what's going to happen now, no matter how wrong it is... Phoenix: But is it really too late? You can still do something about it. You might even be able to fix it... ???: Just... what exactly are you proposing? Phoenix: (What can I do about the seven-year-old case to satisfy the hostage-taker?) Recreate it Phoenix: How about we do a reenactment of the case? ???: So you DO enjoy trampling on people's feelings and rubbing salt in their wounds. Didn't I tell you what would happen to the hostages if you make me mad? Phoenix: N-No! Wait (Gaaagh! I can't make another mistake here!) Leads back to: \"What can I do about the seven-year-old case to satisfy the hostage-taker?\" Retry it in court Leads to: \"I propose we retry the case from seven years ago.\" Ask about it Phoenix: Please tell me all about the case from seven years ago. ???: I'll do nothing of the kind. Besides, what good would it do now? Phoenix: (This isn't working. I have to come up with something I can bargain with.) Leads back to: \"What can I do about the seven-year-old case to satisfy the hostage-taker?\" Phoenix: I propose we retry the case from seven years ago. If you make that demand now, I'm sure nobody will deny you. It wouldn't be an official trial, but at least we could find out the truth! ???: ............Hee hee hee. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! That's good! Real good... Hey, Detective! I'll give you one hour. Get a courtroom ready! Fulbright: O-One hour?! B-But that's impossible! Please give me at least until tomorrow! ???: If you don't mind losing hostages, you can take all the time you want. Oh, but wait...! If we're going to have a retrial, we'll need a prosecutor. Don't worry, I'll take care of that! Phoenix: (S-She will?) ???: And I guess I can be fair and let you come in and check out the crime scene. But Hunk of Junk here will be watching you, so don't try anything funny, you got that? Now, follow Hunk of Junk! Riot police, make way! We're coming through! Pearl: Mr. Nick, wait! I'll help you with the investigation! Phoenix: Thanks, Pearls. I appreciate that. ...Okay! We're going in! December 20Cosmos Space Center - Robotics Lab Phoenix: (Aura dropped us off with a warning not to touch anything until she got back...) Pearl: I wonder what's taking so long? But we can't really start the investigation yet, can we? Phoenix: Even if we could, this mess makes it hard to tell what the room was like seven years ago. Clonco: Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Ack! It's the hostage-taker! Clonco: I'm back to my usual self now. You are still being monitored, however. But more importantly... an important guest has arrived. Phoenix: A-A guest? Anime cutscene Edgeworth: I trust you've been well, Wright. Phoenix: Edgeworth! What are you doing here...? (This is Miles Edgeworth. We've been friends since we were kids. We faced off in court a number of times back when he was a prosecutor, but now...) Pearl: Hello, Prosecutor Edgeworth... Oh! But you're not a \"Prosecutor\" anymore, are you? Um... Phoenix: He's chief prosecutor now. Pretty soon, it'll be a year, right? Edgeworth: A title is nothing more than a title. Don't we have more pressing issues to discuss? Talk Miles Edgeworth Phoenix: So what are you doing here, Edgeworth? Edgeworth: The captor chose me as the prosecutor for the UR-1 case. Phoenix: Wow, she's good. She went all the way up to the top! Edgeworth: I gathered all the information I could in the short time that I had. I'll give you a run-down. Pearl: You're always so well prepared, Prosecutor Edgeworth! Phoenix: Thanks. I appreciate this. I could really use the help. The UR-1 Incident (appears after \"Miles Edgeworth\") Edgeworth: I'll start with a brief overview. The victim was the psychologist Dr. Metis Cykes. Phoenix: Yeah, Athena's mother. Edgeworth: Seven years ago, on the 7th of October, her body was found here in this very room. I have two crime photos and the police notes on them for you to see. Pearl: *gasp* What a terrible way to die... Phoenix: This other photo shows the other side of the room, I see. Seven-Year-Old Photos added to the Court Record. Edgeworth: I also have the autopsy report for you. Metis's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Edgeworth: The murder weapon was the victim's own katana found at the scene. Phoenix: (Yes, Detective Fulbright mentioned she was into Japanese culture...) Edgeworth: The body was found by a Space Center staff member and two police officers. The police were called in because of the sabotage threat on the HAT-1 launch. Phoenix: (Yes, Director Cosmos mentioned this, too.) Edgeworth: A few hours after the body was discovered, a suspect was arrested. The suspect was Simon Blackquill, a young prosecutor. The UR-1 Incident (subsequent times) Edgeworth: I'll start with a brief overview. The victim was the psychologist Dr. Metis Cykes. Phoenix: Yeah, Athena's mother. Edgeworth: Seven years ago, on the 7th of October, her body was found here in this very room. I have two crime photos and the police notes on them for you to see. Pearl: *gasp* What a terrible way to die... Phoenix: This other photo shows the other side of the room, I see. Edgeworth: I also have the autopsy report for you.

Edgeworth: The body was found by a Space Center staff member and two police officers. The police were called in because of the sabotage threat on the HAT-1 launch. Phoenix: (Yes, Director Cosmos mentioned this, too.) Edgeworth: A few hours after the body was discovered, a suspect was arrested. The suspect was Simon Blackquill, a young prosecutor. Simon Blackquill (appears after \"The UR-1 Incident\") Phoenix: I heard his trial was over in a flash. Edgeworth: Yes. A guilty verdict was declared in only one session. Not only did he plead guilty, but there was decisive evidence against him, too. Phoenix: The security camera video... ...and a photo of the moment of the crime, as I recall. Pearl: But did Prosecutor Blackquill have a motive? Edgeworth: Mmm. To this day, his motive is still unknown. He insisted he did it, but he would never say why. Phoenix: So that means... he must still be hiding something. Edgeworth: Right. And there's another aspect of the case that was never revealed to the public. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. The part about the spy, right? Edgeworth: Wright! How on earth do you know about that?! Phoenix: Director Cosmos told me, after a bit of pressure. He told me espionage and sabotage were behind The Hat-1 [sic] Miracle. Pearl: Don't worry! I won't tell anyone! I've always been good at keeping secrets! Edgeworth: Well, I might as well tell you now. They really do suspect Blackquill of being a spy. They think he sabotaged the rocket and killed Dr. Cykes to steal the moon rock. But if you can prove that the HAT-2 bombing is the work of the same spy... Phoenix: We can stay the execution...? Edgeworth: It's a possibility. That's why I intend to help you any way I can. Phoenix: Thanks, Edgeworth. Now all I have to do is comb this room for evidence. Pearl: Let's do it together! Simon Blackquill (subsequent times) Phoenix: I heard his trial was over in a flash. Edgeworth: Yes. A guilty verdict was declared in only one session. Not only did he plead guilty, but there was decisive evidence against him, too. Phoenix: The security camera video... ...and a photo of the moment of the crime, as I recall. Present Attorney's Badge Edgeworth: It must be nice to finally have your attorney's badge back. Phoenix: Yeah. It's been eight years. I'm sorry for all I put you through. Edgeworth: No... I'm sorry I wasn't able to help you. Phoenix: Nah. I was the one that made the decision. Edgeworth: But now you can stand in court once again. And you can mow them down just like you used to. Phoenix: (W-Way to put pressure on a guy. And since when did I get such a brutal reputation?) Terran's Autopsy Report or Utility Knife Edgeworth: Another young life lost to the hands of a cruel killer. Phoenix: ...Edgeworth, you don't think Athena's the culprit, do you? Edgeworth: Hmph. That's up to the evidence, and the truth they reveal, Wright. Phoenix: And what about the hostage situation? Edgeworth: The law will deal with the hostage-taker. Remember, we must never stoop to threats or acts of violence ourselves. Even if people's lives are on the line. Phoenix: Edgeworth... (He may be a stickler for the rule of law, but I have no better ally in this world than him.) Space Center Pamphlet or \"Hope\" Capsule Edgeworth: The Hope capsule samples, brought back from some distant asteroid... Risking his own safety, the victim brought them with him from the launch pad. Phoenix: They must've been very valuable. Edgeworth: Yes. All nations are itching to get their hands on such materials. Wright, this case may turn out to be more than just a murder case, you know. Phoenix: ...That's fine. Come what may, my top priority is to defend my clients. Anything else Edgeworth: Wright... Please stop presenting random evidence just to see how that person will react. Phoenix: But, that's the thing. I need to see how people will react in order to question them. Edgeworth: And what if it's evidence that person isn't privy to? Phoenix: Aha ha ha! That doesn't happen... much... Edgeworth: Hmph. You never change. And I'm afraid I'll never understand your assortment of oddball clients either. Examine (after clearing \"Simon Blackquill\" Talk option) Robot on desk Phoenix: Oh, look. It's a little robot. I wonder what it does? Cleaning, maybe? A cleaning robot must follow a human's orders, as long as it causes no human harm. Phoenix: Yikes! It talks! A cleaning robot must keep desks clean without violating the preceding clause. However, Miss Aura says she prefers a moderate leave of clutter on the desk... Oh, what is the purpose of my existence? Phoenix: (I guess \"slack off\" and \"cut some corners\" aren't in his vocabulary bank.) Desk on left Phoenix: Aura's desk is a mess, though that doesn't surprise me. Pearl: Ooh, I just want to dive in and straighten it up! Phoenix: ...Wait, before you do... Aura: Metis... Phoenix: (Huh? She just glanced over at her desk.) Phoenix: (It's... Metis Cykes...) Clonco, can I talk to you? (I really hope he's back to normal.) Clonco: You wish to speak to me, Mr. Wright? If you're going to hit me, please avoid the face area. Phoenix: (Hey, don't put me in the same class as that woman!) What was Aura like seven years ago at the time of the incident? Clonco: When Mother died, Miss Aura was... confused. Phoenix: (Huh. So he calls Dr. Cykes \"Mother,\" but Aura Blackquill \"Miss Aura\"...?) Clonco: With the loss, she exhibited a severe catecholamine imbalance. Pearl: Excuse me, but I have no idea what that means. Clonco: Pardon me. Searching for alternative expression... She would spend the nights crying, and then take out her feelings on those around her. Edgeworth: After Prosecutor Blackquill was found guilty, she repeatedly demanded a retrial as well. Clonco: That is correct. But without new evidence, her requests were ignored. And then, little by little, Miss Aura began to change. She started to hate it when I called her \"Mama Aura.\" Phoenix: (And before long, she started hating the court system, and abusing Clonco, huh...?) Pearl: That murder destroyed so many lives... Edgeworth: Wright, take a look at this paper on Dr. Cykes and Ms. Blackquill's research. Phoenix: (Ponco and Clonco. They're the \"robots with hearts\" that Dr. Cykes created.) A heartbeat detection system lets them determine when a human is present. In addition, they can recognize people by their ID tag or facial features... ...and they can infer people's emotions by analyzing their tone of voice. That's amazing. Hey, I don't know, Edgeworth. They might even be more human than you. Edgeworth: Wh-What's that supposed to mean? Phoenix: (It kind of sounds like these robots can do what Athena does...) Robots with a Heart added to the Court Record. Desk on left (subsequent times) Phoenix: Aura's desk is a mess, though that doesn't surprise me. Pearl: Ooh, I just want to dive in and straighten it up! Phoenix: ...Wait, before you do... Aura: Metis... Phoenix: (Huh? She just glanced over at her desk.) Phoenix: (It's... Metis Cykes...)

Operating table Phoenix: It looks like... an operating table. It's in the photo, too. Edgeworth: Yes, it was here then as well, with the victim's body lying on it. Pearl: There's a button here... Oh! I know! I'll try pushing it! Phoenix: Pearls! Don't touch th-- Pearl: ...Oopsie. Phoenix: Hey! It's moving! Edgeworth: Hmm... It appears to be a robot-assembly device. Pearl: \"Disassemble anything in a flash! Push the 'Dismantle' button!\" That sounds pretty neat! Can I push it, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Please don't push any more buttons, Pearls. Operating table (subsequent times) Phoenix: It looks like... an operating table. It's in the photo, too. Edgeworth: Yes, it was here then as well, with the victim's body lying on it. Hmm... It appears to be a robot-assembly device. Pearl: \"Disassemble anything in a flash! Push the 'Dismantle' button!\" That sounds pretty neat! Can I push it, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Please don't push any more buttons, Pearls. Emergency ladder Phoenix: An emergency ladder. This must be the one they used during the evacuation. Aura: The explosion disabled the elevators. So I lowered my emergency ladder like the detective leading the evacuation told me to. Edgeworth: As Ms. Blackquill was climbing down the side of the building, she saw the culprit inside. Phoenix: (I wonder which would've been scarier: that, or looking down...?) Emergency Ladder added to the Court Record. Emergency ladder (subsequent times) Phoenix: An emergency ladder. This must be the one they used during the evacuation. Aura: The explosion disabled the elevators. So I lowered my emergency ladder like the detective leading the evacuation told me to. Edgeworth: As Ms. Blackquill was climbing down the side of the building, she saw the culprit inside. Phoenix: (I wonder which would've been scarier: that, or looking down...?) Rolling cases Phoenix: Hey, look at this row of rolling cases. I bet the wheels make it easier for people to move heavy research materials around. Pearl: I bet they'd be fun to ride around in. We could even probably both fit into the biggest one! I know! We could have Prosecutor Edgeworth push us! Phoenix: I don't trust him not to push us down a flight of stairs... Unfinished robot arm Phoenix: What's this? A giant robot arm, maybe? Pearl: It's pretty big for an arm, but you're right! I think these thin parts here are finger bones! They're even about as long as my legs! Phoenix: And there's a spiked ball and giant drill on the floor, too... Is Aura trying to build some kind of weapon of massive destruction? Pearl: Maybe she wants to use it to demolish a big building or something? Phoenix: (I can picture her gleefully tearing down the street doing just that... I'd better not think about it anymore.) Charging station Phoenix: What's this? It looks like a giant power plug. Edgeworth: Hmm... It's attached to what looks like an electric vehicle charging station... Clonco: That's a charging station for us robots. We come here periodically and charge ourselves up. Phoenix: Wow. Machines that maintain themselves. That's pretty cool. Clonco: If out batteries run out and we lose consciousness... ...we never know what Miss Aura will do to us while we're down, you see. Phoenix: (Nothing motivates quite like fear, huh?) \"JT-02\" robot or spiked ball Phoenix: This is one heck of a robot. Pearl: There's something written on it... Is this supposed to be a poem? \"I cut down anyone who displeases me. I make the rules. I am the law. I wield the ultimate gavel of judgment. I am Judgetron (JT-02)!\" Edgeworth: I don't believe we need to bother with that, Pearl. It's not even completed yet. Phoenix: He's right, Pearls. There's no sign of it in the photo from seven years ago, either. Edgeworth: They were building the Hope space probe here at the time. The murder occurred after the space probe had been removed from the room. Phoenix: (So it was long gone by the time someone took this picture, huh.) Pearl: But you can see the probe in this newspaper photo. Edgeworth: Yes. And you can see the stolen moon rock there, too. Phoenix: (That strange black and yellow thing on the left side of the picture?) Edgeworth: Note that the same rock is absent from the crime scene photo. Cosmos: Not only that, but before the launch, a very valuable piece of moon rock was stolen. Athena: I hear there's lots of research into moon rocks and star dust from asteroids these days. They say the results could potentially have a huge impact on all of civilization! It's like we're in a new space race with every other country out there. Phoenix: So the person who stole it... Think it was our spy? Edgeworth: I'm sure of it. Dr. Cykes was probably killed because she was a roadblock in their plan. Unfortunately, the government thinks Prosecutor Blackquill is the culprit... \"JT-02\" robot or spiked ball (subsequent times) Phoenix: It takes someone like Aura Blackquill to actually build something like this... Pearl: Oh, there's more to the poem! \"Guilty or not, it doesn't matter. I burn the law books for my fuel. My laser of judgment pierces your soul. I am Judgetron (JT-02)!\" Edgeworth: We've heard enough of that, I believe. Pearl: Aww... Are you sure you don't want to hear the third stanza...? Desk on right Phoenix: It's about as cluttered as my office, but I think it's a workbench. Pearl: Mr. Nick, I think this must be a kitchen. Look at this photo. See the cute little food processor? Edgeworth: That isn't a food processor, Pearls. That's the Hope capsule. It was scheduled to be loaded onto the Hope space probe that fateful day. The three people who came to collect the capsule discovered the body. Phoenix: The first on the scene, huh? A staff member and two police officers, was it? (And they were here to collect the capsule... Which reminds me...) Apollo: So they planned to use this bag to carry the capsule, is that right? Aura: Yeah, more or less. ...Say, why don't we stop talking about the case and have a nice cup of tea instead? Phoenix: (Apollo and Aura Blackquill? I wonder what they're talking about?) Phoenix: Edgeworth, did those three people have a bag with them for transporting the capsule? Edgeworth: Oh, you mean this? It's a custom-made, shock-resistant bag. But how did you know? Phoenix: Oh, I just overheard Apollo making an inquiry about it, that's all. Edgeworth: Hmm... So he's looking into the case from seven years ago on his own, is he? \"Hope\" Capsule updated in the Court Record. Desk on right (subsequent times) Phoenix: It's about as cluttered as my office, but I think it's a workbench. Pearl: Mr. Nick, I think this must be a kitchen. Look at this photo. See the cute little food processor? Edgeworth: That isn't a food processor, Pearls. That's the Hope capsule. It was scheduled to be loaded onto the Hope space probe that fateful day.

Phoenix: Oh, I just overheard Apollo making an inquiry about it, that's all. Edgeworth: Hmm... So he's looking into the case from seven years ago on his own, is he? After examining desk on left, operating table, emergency ladder, \"JT-02\" robot or spiked ball, and desk on right: Phoenix: Well, I guess that's about it for this room. Edgeworth: So what do you think, Wright? Any ideas? Phoenix: There are still a lot of gaps in the evidence, but I'll pull it off somehow! After all... ...you asked me to prove Blackquill's innocence, right, Edgeworth? Pearl: What?! He did?! Phoenix: Yup. He called it a \"special request.\" He reached out to me while I was still disbarred. Talk Edgeworth's request Pearl: So that was what sparked you to get your attorney's badge back? Phoenix: ...Yup, the Blackquill case. Edgeworth: Wright, I have a special request. ...I want you to clear one of my subordinates of suspicion. Phoenix: Hey, I'm not even a lawyer anymore, remember? Haven't been one for a long time. Edgeworth: That eight-year misunderstanding has been cleared up, and you must be eager to return. I'm sure you're familiar with the other case that ushered in the \"dark age of the law\"? Phoenix: ! Edgeworth: Very soon, a convict will stand as a prosecutor in court. I want you to keep an eye on him. Phoenix: Aww, just when I'm beginning to actually like the job I have now... Edgeworth: Wright... I'm sorry I dragged you into this... Because of the espionage aspect, I wasn't free to give you all the details... Phoenix: Hey, no need to apologize. It's like I said on the phone the other day... ...I know that the type of criminals you're after now aren't small fries anymore. Phoenix: It looks like your target finally decided to make a move. Yeah... It's for this very reason I returned. Time to bring it to an end. Phoenix: I'm going to end the dark age of the law. That's what this is all about. The dark age of the law (appears after \"Edgeworth's request\") Leads to: \"\"The dark age of the law\"... It sure comes up a lot these days on TV and in the papers.\" Pearl: \"The dark age of the law\"... It sure comes up a lot these days on TV and in the papers. And I hear there are more false charges and fabrication of evidence than ever. Edgeworth: When I became chief prosecutor, the court system had already lost the people's trust. It all began eight years ago. A lawyer was caught fabricating evidence... And a year after that, a prosecutor was found guilty of murder. Pearl: Wait! D-Do you mean...?! Phoenix: That's right. He's talking about my case and Prosecutor Blackquill's. Edgeworth: It was a downward spiral after that, an absolute nightmare. After those two cases, the mass media launched an all-out attack on the courts. Public opinion was tainted, and, before long, the legal world itself was sucked into it. Phoenix: It's such a shame... Once suspicion forms, it's very hard to shake. Lawyers and prosecutors were supposed to trust each other -- pursue the truth together. Pearl: It's so sad when people begin to cast doubt. They start lying to themselves and each other. Phoenix: Yes, and do absolutely anything to win. We're in an age now where winning is valued far more than the truth. I'm sure it's caused our new chief prosecutor to lose many a night's rest. (Is it just me or did his brow get even more furrowed than the last time I saw him...?) Edgeworth: Hmph. The hostage-taker's disdain for the courts is a perfect example of the times. Phoenix: *sigh* It sure is. Edgeworth: Do you have any idea who the hostage-taker might be? Phoenix: Well, somebody who mistrusts the court system and can manipulate robots... ...It can really only be Aura Blackquill. Who else but her would want a retrial of that case from seven years ago so badly? Edgeworth: Simon Blackquill's older sister and the owner of this room... I agree with your conclusion. Perhaps she intended to force Ms. Cykes to confess... Phoenix: (Actually, I think she had a much more horrific plan in mind for Athena...) Edgeworth: The important thing is for you to solve UR-1 and prove Blackquill's innocence. Pearl: And then maybe she'll release the hostages! Edgeworth: I'm counting on you, Wright, to set that prosecutor and those hostages free. Phoenix: And I'll be counting on you in court to help me, too. Edgeworth: Of course. I'll do everything I can to help uncover the truth. As this isn't an official trial, I'm more at liberty to be a little unorthodox. Clonco: Mr. Wright, are you finished with your investigation? Phoenix: Yeah, but I'd like you to tell the hostage-taker something for me. I have to go to the Detention Center. I can't start the trial until I've talked to Athena. Clonco: She's already given her consent. I'll accompany you to the detention center. Phoenix: (So I'm still being watched, huh?) I'll see you in court, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Hmph. Even if it will be an undocumented trial, it'll be good to face you in court again. December 20Detention Center - Visitor's Room Phoenix: (She was right by my side only a few short hours ago... ...but I feel like I haven't seen her in ages...) Oh! Mr. Wright! Athena: And Pearly, too! I knew you would come. After all, the first step is the interview with the defendant. Phoenix: And because you're my friend and I was worried about you. Athena: Heh heh. Thanks, Boss. Phoenix: I'm not the only one who's worried, either. Athena: Really? Who else? Phoenix: I saw Ms. Woods today. She was so beside herself, she came to find me. She told me you used to live in the Cosmos Space Center. No wonder you knew so much about the place! Athena: Oh... So you know, huh? I... I'm sorry I didn't tell you. Phoenix: That's all right. But... there are some other things I'd like to ask you. Athena: Sure, you can ask me anything. I promise I won't keep any more secrets from you! Talk The day of the crime Phoenix: Tell me about the day Clay was murdered. Athena: I... I was actually at the Space Center that day. In... In the Space Museum... Phoenix: (Right where the culprit fled to?! That's not good...) Athena: I never could fully deal with what happened seven years ago... But when I saw the Center again during the news coverage of the HAT-2 launch... ...I thought maybe if I went there, things would be different this time... Pearl: That must've taken a lot of courage, to face your past like that... Athena: So I went to the Space Museum the evening before the explosions. This was before the launch pads had been switched... There was sign that said \"closed for repairs,\" and they weren't letting anybody in. Phoenix: Yeah, the director couldn't very well switch the pads if there were people in there... Athena: But I snuck in anyway. Phoenix: Did you want to see that HAT-1 group photo, the one with your mother in it? Athena: I did... but what I really wanted to see was her jacket. Phoenix: (That jacket on display... That was Dr. Cykes's...?) HAT-1 Exhibit updated in the Court Record. Athena: But I should've known it wouldn't be easy to get over such a traumatic experience... The second I saw that jacket, it all came rushing back to me. Everything around me went hazy and I couldn't see... ...I tried to get out of there somehow... But I guess I passed out. When I came to, I was in the passage behind the rocket. I was in the shadows, where people couldn't really see me. Phoenix: Maybe you got confused and went the wrong way when you were trying to leave? Pearl: How long do you think you were unconscious, Athena? Athena: I was out until about noon of the next day. I didn't even know about the explosions. When I woke up, nobody was around, so I just went out into Boarding Lounge 2. My mind must've still been fuzzy, because my memory is vague after that. I don't remember how I got home. Phoenix: No memory, huh...? (This is gonna be tough...) Athena: Which means... What if I'm the one who killed Clay...?! Phoenix: I think that's enough of that, Athena. Let's talk about something else. (So, during the entire incident, she was unconscious in the Space Museum... Of course I believe her... ...but will anybody else...?) The day of the crime (subsequent times) Phoenix: Tell me about the day Clay was murdered. Athena: I... I was actually at the Space Center that day. In... In the Space Museum... Phoenix: (Right where the culprit fled to?! That's not good...) Athena: I never could fully deal with what happened seven years ago...

Let's talk about something else. (So, during the entire incident, she was unconscious in the Space Museum... Of course I believe her... ...but will anybody else...?) Your mother's work (appears after \"The day of the crime\") Phoenix: What kind of research was Dr. Cykes... your mother... doing? Athena: Machines that could tell people's emotions by their tone of voice... and my special ability. Someday, when people travel to distant planets, their companions will be robots. So she said they had to be able to understand how their human companions felt. Pearl: Wow! Robots that can understand people! Athena: I was just a convenient subject for her research. All she ever did was work, and she never paid any attention to me. ...Oh, sorry about that, dredging up all that old stuff... Phoenix: No need to apologize. (I guess her home life was... complicated...) Oh, by the way. Ms. Woods said something about you always wearing headphones...? Woods: She always wore these big, heavy-looking headphones. She said her mother made them for her, as part of her research. Athena: I had to wear them every time I went out. Oh, I hated them so much! But she wouldn't listen... Pearl: What were they for? Athena: Oh, she gave me some kind of explanation... ...but I don't remember now. It was too difficult for a little kid to understand. Phoenix: Okay... But let me say this one thing. I don't think your mother only thought of you as some handy subject for her research. Athena: I... I want to believe that. But just about the only things my mother left me with are Widget... ...and this earring. Pearl: Ooh! It's beautiful! Athena: It's made of a piece of real moon rock she had for research. Maybe she did love me, in her own way... Phoenix: I'm sure of it. I'm really sure she did. (Because that's what I want to believe, too.) Moon Rock Earring added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (I'd better ask her a little more about her mother's research. I should show her that paper I found in the robotics lab.) Your mother's work (appears after \"The day of the crime\") Phoenix: What kind of research was Dr. Cykes... your mother... doing?

I should show her that paper I found in the robotics lab.) Seven years ago (appears after \"Your mother's work\", then presenting Robots with a Heart) Phoenix: On a different subject... Did you hear about the person holding up the Space Center? Athena: Yes, a little. And this person has even taken hostages? Phoenix: (I guess I'd better spare her the news about Trucy...) Well... ...after some negotiating, we agreed to do a retrial of the case from seven years ago. Athena: What? You're kidding me! So that means... Prosecutor Blackquill might...?! Phoenix: Yup. I know he's innocent. I just have to prove it. So, wait. Did you know him back then? Athena: Yes. He used to come visit my mom a lot. He studied psychology under her, and would sometimes ask for advice on his legal cases. He was very kind and considerate, and straight as an arrow. Phoenix: (Unlike now, where he's more twisted than a basket of snakes...) Athena: That's why I took the witness stand during his trial seven years ago. \"Please! You have to listen to me!\" Athena: \"He didn't kill her! His heart is screaming that he didn't kill her!\" Athena: I was a fool. How could anybody else know what I was talking about? Phoenix: (She heard... the voice of his heart...) Pearl: You were only eleven then, right? You were very brave just to give testimony. Phoenix: Pearls is right. You did the very best you could at the time. Athena: But... nothing I said did any good. I was a shaking and scared little girl, small and ineffectual. Even after I went to live with my relatives in Europe, I stayed closed up in my shell. Pearl: But you're different now! You're always so bright and cheerful! Athena: Thanks. That's because one day, I came to realize that I had to fight. I couldn't give up. I exercised hard and I studied hard. I wanted to become the strongest lawyer I could be. Why you became a lawyer (appears after \"Seven years ago\") Leads to: \"I wanted to save Simon, but I had no idea how.\" Present Robots with a Heart (after clearing \"Your mother's work\" Talk option) Athena: Oh, the Ponco series! You must've gone to the robotics lab. Phoenix: You seem to really love Ponco and Clonco. Athena: Yeah, my mother made them and I grew up around them, you know. Pearl: Oh, there's one of those cute little robots in this photo, too. Athena: Ha ha. See Ponco's bandages? I put those on her. I just wound them around and around. Pretty bad job, huh? But I really put my all into it. I hardly left the Center in those days, so I didn't have any human friends besides Junie. I didn't really understand the difference between robots and people back then. I thought that if a robot broke, bandaging it would help it get better. What a weirdo I was! Phoenix: It looks like there's something written on the bandages. Athena: Yeah, I wrote stuff like, \"Get well soon, Ponco!\" But, in the end, my mom just put her on the operating table and fixed her in a flash. Pearl: Oh! That must be the thing I made move in the robotics lab. Athena: I was so impressed by what my mom did. I even asked me if she would put me on the table and fix me if I ever got hurt. It looked just like magic to me, what she could do. Phoenix: (A little girl who grew up around robots... She seems to have some good memories of it.) Terran's Autopsy Report or Utility Knife Athena: Could it have been me who killed Clay...? Did I kill Apollo's friend...? Phoenix: Of course you didn't! We all believe in you. Athena: I hope that includes Apollo... Anything else Athena: *sigh* I wonder if I'll ever get the chance to present evidence like that again... I'll probably never work as a lawyer again now... Phoenix: Don't talk like that, Athena! We're going to clear you of all suspicion. Just you wait! Athena: I hope you can... I really hope you can... Athena: I wanted to save Simon, but I had no idea how. Then I met Mr. Wright, and thanks to him... ...I realized that if I became a lawyer, I could prove that Simon was innocent. I also realized that psychology could help me do this. I mean... ...psychology was my mother's specialty. When I studied it... ...I felt like she was there with me, supporting me. Phoenix: (It doesn't seem like Athena knows... ...that Prosecutor Blackquill is due to be executed tomorrow.) Athena: I wanted to prove Simon's innocence personally. I wanted to do it so bad... Even now, I want to fly out of here and go save him! Phoenix: (Come to think of it, she said something like that during the Themis Legal Academy trial. She mentioned there was somebody she wanted to save... She must've been talking about Prosecutor Blackquill...) Athena: I heard some prison guards say that you had an interview with Simon. How was he? What did he say? Phoenix: ............! (No! I can't tell her! But how can I lie to Athena?!) ...He was doing well. He was happy about the possibility of being proven innocent. Athena: He was? I wonder if he smiled, like he used to... back then... Phoenix: (If I can't prove Prosecutor Blackquill's innocence in this trial... ...I don't think Athena will ever forgive me... I just have to free him! Failure is not an option here!) Fulbright: Ah, I thought you might be here! Mr. Lawyer, we're in trouble! Phoenix: W-We are? What is it? Fulbright: I couldn't find a single open courtroom. They're all in session. Pearl: Oh, no! But this is an emergency! Fulbright: Hmm... It's very difficult to interrupt a trial once it's underway... Phoenix: My phone! ...It's from Trucy! ???: I told you I'd give you one hour. I guess it's time to pick one of the hostages... Phoenix: No! Wait! We still have a little more time! Besides... all of the courtrooms are being used right now! ???: Make all the excuses you want, but you won't get more time. Your daughter is first. The poor thing. She's a little too young to die, don't you think? Phoenix: NO! Don't you dare hurt her! (There has to be something I can do!) Fulbright: Nnngh... The cruelest injustice is about to befall us! Pearl: No! This can't be happening! Mystic Maya... help us! Phoenix: (Wait a minute... Maya...?) I read somewhere that you were holding a trial in the middle of an exploding courtroom? That must've really been something, although weird is par for the course with you. Phoenix: (A courtroom... blew up...! That's it! There IS a courtroom we can use after all!) ???: Okay, time's up! Too bad. Any last words you'd like to say to her? Phoenix: Phoenix: Aura, please don't add to the crimes you've already committed. ???: So you know who I am, do you? It wasn't like I was trying to keep it a secret anyway... Phoenix: We're ready to start the trial. We can hold it in the ruins of Courtroom No. 4, the one blown up by the bomber. Pearl: Oh! What a wonderful idea, Mr. Nick! Fulbright: I... I never would have thought of that! An astonishing trial in an astonishing location! I guess it's only befitting. I'll go get the place ready right away! Phoenix: (I didn't exactly pick the place for its \"astonishing\" factor...) How about it? Are you ready to have your brother's innocence proven? ???: My brother...? Heh. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Oh, I'm sorry. Did I forget to mention...? It's not Simon you'll be defending. Phoenix: What? (Not... Prosecutor Blackquill...?) ???: I indict Athena Cykes, on the charge of murdering her own mother! You'll be defending the little princess there, the one behind the glass. Phoenix: (WH-WHAAAT?!) ???: See you in that mountain of rubble you've chosen for our courtroom, Mr. Wright! Pearl: What is she talking about? Athena...?! Athena: Of course... Why didn't it ever occur to me before? If Prosecutor Blackquill is innocent, somebody else had to have been the true culprit. Did I..? Did I... kill my own mother...? N-No......... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! 5 BLACK PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: ! No way... It can't be true! Pearl: Mr. Nick! What's the matter?! Phoenix: I see... I see five black Psyche-Locks! (I've seen these kinds of locks before... Dark, black locks protecting a secret deep inside a person's heart... (And there's no way to remove them!) To be continued Wright Anything Agency (before clearing \"Why you became a lawyer\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room) Talk What to do Pearl: What a terrible situation this is! Phoenix: Trucy... I still can't believe it... Pearl: Trucy will be all right, Mr. Nick. She's such a strong girl. Phoenix: Yeah... I'm sure she's hanging in there. (But if anything were to happen to her...) S-She's counting on us, Pearls, so let's get out there and do what we can! Pearl: I agree! Any ideas? Pearl: That robot named Clonco... He's very articulate, isn't he? Phoenix: That wasn't the robot talking. It was the hostage-taker speaking through him. Pearl: What? You mean... there was a person inside the robot? Phoenix: No, it's not like that, Pearls. Pearl: Hmm? Then... what do you mean? Phoenix: How can I explain it? It's kind of like a telephone. Pearl: So it wasn't a robot. It was a telephone? Phoenix: Yes... No... Hold on. Now I'M confused! Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: Nothing special here. Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I think I have enough evidence, but maybe I should do a bit more thinking first...)\n-- Apollo Justice's Accusation --Apollo: I suspected Ms. Cykes of the murder of Clay Terran.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: What first made you suspicious of Ms. Cykes? Apollo: It all started when Ms. Cykes and I were investigating the crime scene. When she saw the weapon that killed Mr. Terran... ...my bracelet reacted. She said she'd never seen the knife before, but my bracelet told me otherwise. And then, every time after that... ...my bracelet would react when she talked about the case. Phoenix: (Poor Apollo must've been beside himself during that investigation...) Apollo: I didn't know what to do or think. I couldn't even sleep. In that condition, I knew I wouldn't be any good in court. So I decided to wear an eye patch, so I wouldn't be able to perceive any of her tells. Phoenix: (So that's why Apollo was acting so strangely...) But the reason Ms. Cykes unconsciously reacted to the knife is because... ...she stabbed her mother's murderer with one identical to it seven years ago. Apollo: Apollo: But that knife was also the murder weapon that was used to kill Clay Terran. My bracelet could've also reacted to her because she knew she was his killer, too. Phoenix: Ungh... (I guess he has a point...) Apollo: But my bracelet wasn't the only reason I became suspicious of her...Apollo: My growing suspicions were confirmed when this incriminating evidence presented itself.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: That's the lighter found in the Space Museum with her fingerprints on it, right? But even if it seems decisive, there must be other facts we don't know about it yet! Apollo: If that's so, go ahead and prove it, then! Look, honestly, I don't want to believe it's true, either...! But... But Ms. Cykes was the only one who was in the Space Museum at the time of the murder. Phoenix: But, Mr. Justice! Ms. Cykes had absolutely no motive to kill Mr. Terran! Apollo: Apollo: Seven years ago, Ms. Cykes lived at the Cosmos Space Center. It wouldn't be strange if she had some kind of connection to him. Besides, people sometimes kill for motives we can't even imagine. I know you've seen plenty of cases like that in your own career, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (I still can't believe this... How can you actually suspect Athena, Apollo?)Apollo: In addition, she's the only one who could have utilized the launch pad switch to escape.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Isn't it possible that somebody else used that same escape route? Apollo: I'm afraid not, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Why not? Apollo: Recall there is a security camera in Boarding Lounge 1 aimed at the launch pad door. It's the camera that captured Mr. Terran and Mr. Starbuck. But there's also another security camera in Boarding Lounge 2. It recorded Mr. Terran's killer, or rather, Ms. Cykes coming out of the Space Museum. Phoenix: A camera in Boarding Lounge 2? (First I've heard of it, but it makes sense... Athena said she had snuck into the Space Museum the night before the incident... ...and then was overcome and passed out until around noon the next day.) Athena: I was out until about noon of the next day. I didn't even know about the explosions. When I woke up, nobody was around, so I just went out into Boarding Lounge 2. Phoenix: (That must've been when the camera captured her. And that's what made Apollo suspect her even more... But wait a minute...) In that case, it most likely recorded the true culprit as well. Apollo: Apollo: That's a negative on that one too, Mr. Wright. In the footage taken after the incident............ Ms. Cykes is the only one who appears. Phoenix: WHAT?! WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY?! Judge: Order! Order in the court! Phoenix: (That can't be! But if it is, then it is incredibly incriminating...) Edgeworth: Wasn't it YOU who proved in the previous trial that the way the true culprit escaped... ...was via the Space Museum after the pads had been switched? Hmph. A fact you previously proved, turned on its ear, leaving your client high and dry... I must say... That is vintage Phoenix Wright. Phoenix: (Nghhh...)Apollo: That is why I wish to indict Ms. Cykes on the charge of murder!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Believing in your client to the end is a basic principle of good defense. Shouldn't you extend that same principle to your own co-worker? Apollo: You're probably right. Maybe I'm not even fit to be a lawyer... However... I don't care. This case is special to me! Clay was my friend...! And that's why I just have to know the truth... Phoenix: (Apollo suspected his trusted co-worker of killing his friend. To dispel his doubts, he investigated on his own, but that only led to more doubts. Apollo must've been really struggling with this... Well, Apollo may have doubts, but...) ...I'll say it again. Athena Cykes isn't the murderer. Apollo: Then I have only one thing to say. \"Evidence is everything in court.\" Well, Mr. Wright? Think you have the concrete proof to knock down my arguments?Phoenix: (His points of contention are the fingerprints on the lighter, and the escape route, huh? Apollo knows how I operate, so I can't use my usual tactics on him. It looks like the only thing I can do here is press him for more information.)After pressing all statements:Judge: Hmm... Your arguments have been very clear, Mr. Justice. And your facts appear to be indisputable.Apollo: Well, Mr. Wright? What do you think of MY theory?Phoenix: ............Apollo: It looks like not even you can deny it. Ms. Cykes was the only one who used the only possible escape route.Edgeworth: Under these circumstances, there can be no other suspect but the defendant.Apollo: Unless... ...you think there was an alternative escape route...? Is that what you think, Mr. Wright?Judge: IS that what you think, Mr. Wright?Phoenix: (IS that what you think, Phoenix? Was there an alternative escape route?)Of course Leads to: \"Yes, of course there must have been.\"No way Phoenix: (I don't THINK there was an alternative route, but if I say that, it's all over. I'd better think this through again.) Leads back to: \"Was there an alternative escape route?\"Phoenix: Yes, of course there must have been. (Just don't ask me what...)Apollo: ............! You're just bluffing again, aren't you?Phoenix: Me? Bluff? No way! (............He knows me too well.)............It's fine, Mr. Wright... Even a bluff would suit me just fine... As long as you can...Apollo: ...clear up this doubt inside me!Phoenix: ............Wait! So is that what this is all about?!Apollo: I... I want to believe in Athena. I really do. But what is faith without doubt? That's why... I need to question her guilt! So that once the truth finally comes out, I can really, fully trust her!Athena: So that you can... really trust me?Edgeworth: Hmph. It seems your junior partner has just showed us what trials are truly all about.Phoenix: I believe you're right.Edgeworth: We prosecutors painstakingly question every detail in pursuit of the defendant.Phoenix: While we lawyers believe in and defend our clients to the end.Judge: When both sides go all-out against each other, that's when we discover the truth.Edgeworth: Precisely. And when the battle is over, we will understand the true meaning of trust. That is exactly what trials are about, wouldn't you agree?Apollo: Yes. I couldn't ignore the seed of doubt that was growing inside me. So I decided I needed to face it head-on! No matter what the truth is that's waiting ahead, I won't be afraid!Athena: ............Phoenix: (That's so like Apollo, always uber-earnest about things like this...) Mr. Justice... I vow to dispel every last bit of doubt in your heart!Apollo: Good! Because I want to believe in Ms. Cykes again!Phoenix: (You're really hoping there WAS an alternative route, aren't you, Apollo? But if I use the process of elimination, there really aren't that many possibilities. Director Cosmos was at the southern exit... ...leaving only the Control Room and the corridor to the Space Museum. Which door could the culprit have escaped through?)Apollo: Come on, Mr. Wright! Where do you think the culprit escaped to?Present Space Museum Corridor Phoenix: Leads to: \"They really only could've escaped to the corridor to the Space Museum.\"Present anywhere else Phoenix: Apollo: There? I doubt anybody could have escaped that way... Phoenix: But can you really say with certainty that it isn't possible? Apollo: ............ Yes, I believe I can. Phoenix: ...I guess you're right. Apollo: What are you doing?! This is serious, Mr. Wright! Judge: Please be serious, Mr. Wright! Leads back to: \"You're really hoping there WAS an alternative route, aren't you, Apollo?\"Phoenix: They really only could've escaped to the corridor to the Space Museum. All they had to do was use the unconscious Mr. Starbuck's prints to get through the door.Edgeworth:Edgeworth: It appears that all you're trying to establish is Ms. Cykes's guilt. If the culprit used that route, the only exit would have been into Boarding Lounge 2. The logical conclusion of your argument is that the killer is none other than the defendant!Phoenix: Ungh...Apollo: ............I knew it... That's the only way it could be, huh? If the culprit escaped into the corridor that leads to the Space Museum... ...then I guess it's true. The only exit WOULD have been into Boarding Lounge 2.Phoenix: But Ms. Cykes was the only person... ...captured by the Boarding Lounge 2 security camera.Apollo: I investigated the crime scene thoroughly... ...but the only place the culprit could have escaped to was the Space Museum corridor. There weren't any other secret corridors or anything.Edgeworth: So the leaves us with no other conclusion to draw but that Athena Cykes was the culprit.Phoenix: (What could the answer be? Was there really no other escape route? ............But, hold on a second. What if...? Where did those mysterious leaves we saw in the corridor come from? What if they're a clue to the culprit's real escape route...?) ............I think it IS possible that the culprit escaped into the Space Museum... ...but then came out using a route other than into Boarding Lounge 2.Apollo: Oh?!Phoenix: Launch Pad 1 and the Space Museum were switched after the bombing, meaning... ...the Space Museum corridor was moving along the rail at the time. Which is exactly when an alternative escape route opened up for our culprit!Apollo: A-Are you kidding me?!Edgeworth: Hmph. Judging by the intense look in your eyes, I take it you're serious. Very well, then, Mr. Wright. Do tell. Where could the culprit have gone from the Museum corridor besides Boarding Lounge 2?Present area outside Space Center Phoenix: Leads to: \"We found something odd while investigating the Museum corridor this afternoon.\"Present anywhere else Phoenix: Edgeworth: I see... So you're saying that the Space Museum corridor... ...leads to a spot somewhere in your head? What must it be like, being Phoenix Wright? Phoenix: What? Edgeworth: After all, this \"alternative escape route\" seems to exist only in your mind. Phoenix: Gah... (Well, I think I have a beautiful mind...!) Edgeworth: Perhaps we'd better shut the security door on that corridor tightly... ...so that your ridiculous delusions don't seep out onto us. Judge: Yes, shut it AND lock it, too! Phoenix: (Launch Pad 1 and the Space Museum were switched after the bombing, meaning... the Space Museum corridor was moving along the rail at the time. Which is exactly when an alternative escape route opened up for our culprit!) Please let me try that again! Edgeworth: Fine. Just don't exhaust all of your mental capacities while you're at it. Leads back to: \"Where could the culprit have gone from the Museum corridor besides Boarding Lounge 2?\"Phoenix: We found something odd while investigating the Museum corridor this afternoon. Namely, a few dead leaves on the floor. Considering where dead leaves come from... they point us to exactly where the culprit escaped to.Apollo: Yes, I remember seeing some leaves myself............ Aaaaah! Do you mean...?!Phoenix: Yup. While the Space Museum was in motion, just beyond that corridor's safety door... ...was an alternative place that the culprit could use to escape. In other words, the culprit's real escape route was... ...the area outside the Space Center!Edgeworth: You'reApollo: Freakin'Judge: INSAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANE!Apollo:Apollo: Do you know how impossible that would be?! That corridor is level with the third floor! Even if the culprit tried to leap to the outside wall of the Space Center building... ...they would fall to their death!Phoenix:Phoenix: Ordinarily, yes. But after the bombing incident, the culprit could make use of a certain item.Edgeworth: And what item was it, exactly, Mr. Wright?!Phoenix: All right. This is what the culprit used to leap to the outside wall of the main building.Present Emergency Ladder Phoenix: Leads to: \"An emergency ladder...?!\"Present anything else Phoenix: Edgeworth: Hmph. Why don't you demonstrate how it could've been done with that, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Um, what? Edgeworth: You're saying that the culprit used that to escape, are you not? Then why don't you show us and use that item yourself to leap to a third-floor wall! Phoenix: Well, uh... GAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Judge: I suggest a less reckless answer next time, Mr. Wright! Edgeworth: Why don't you try one more time? Leads back to: \"All right. This is what the culprit used to leap to the outside wall of the main building.\"Edgeworth: An emergency ladder...?!Phoenix: There was an emergency ladder in the fourth-floor robotics lab. And it was used that day after the explosions to help evacuate people. Ms. Blackquill herself used that ladder to escape down to ground level. Recall that the launch pads were switched after the ladder was lowered. The corridor would have passed by the ladder while the pads were being switched. And that's when the culprit literally sprang into action! And leapt onto the ladder!Apollo: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Wh-Who would have imagined...?!Judge: Order! Order in the court! Well! An alternative escape route seems to have emerged!Apollo: Which means someone other than Ms. Cykes could have been the culprit, right?!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: Making things up on the fly in an attempt to sway the court again, are we, Mr. Wright? Your theory has so many holes, it puts Swiss cheese to shame!Phoenix: All right, then. Name one.Edgeworth: I have here detailed information about the Space Center. According to this... ...the distance between the Museum Corridor and the main building during movement is... ...a full twenty feet.Phoenix: T-Twenty feet? You're pulling my leg, right?Edgeworth: In addition, the corridor is three floors from the ground, or roughly fifty feet. What's more, the culprit would be leaping to a precarious place............ an unstable ladder.Phoenix: Urk.Edgeworth: Human beings feel fear in dangerous situations. It's a basic survival instinct. An ordinary person would certainly hesitate before jumping... ...or even freeze in fear and not jump at all.Phoenix:Phoenix: B-But the culprit had just murdered someone. They weren't in an ordinary state of mind.Edgeworth:Edgeworth: Nevertheless, why would they have taken that kind of risk? They could have waited for the switch to be complete and escaped to Boarding Lounge 2.Phoenix:Phoenix: Because there was a security camera in Boarding Lounge 2. The culprit knew they would be recorded if they left the Space Museum that way!Edgeworth:Edgeworth: In that case, the culprit could have hidden in the museum until things settled down... ...and then blended in with the other people after the museum was opened.Phoenix: That's a good point!Edgeworth: But you claim that, despite all this, the culprit took a twenty-foot death-defying leap? And all in the brief moment that the corridor and ladder passed by each other?Phoenix: That's... also a good point...Edgeworth: They would have needed a running start while the corridor was moving to make that jump. If their timing was off or if they couldn't jump far enough, it would have been instant death. What kind of person would attempt something like that?!Phoenix: Stop bringing up good points, Edgeworth...Edgeworth: This \"true culprit\" of yours is nothing but a figment of your imagination!Phoenix: Why do you always have to point out every flaw?!?!?!Apollo: Mr. Edgeworth's right -- that does sound pretty insane. The culprit would have to be someone who feels no fear, like a stuntman.Phoenix: (But everyone feels fear on some level, right? ............Wait a minute! Aha! I've got it this time!) I can prove that there is someone who could've used this alternate escape route!Edgeworth: Oh, can you now?Phoenix: This proves the possibility of a person who could've used this alternative escape route!Present Phantom's Psych Profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"What's that, Mr. Wright?\"Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This should clear everything up! Edgeworth: Hmph. Clearly not. Phoenix: Phoenix: Yes, it does! It even suggests the possibility of a third or fourth escape route! Judge: The only thing this suggests to me is YOU need an escape route out of life. Phoenix: Gah! (That didn't work... Didn't I have some evidence that proves the existence of somebody without fear...?) Leads back to: \"This proves the possibility of a person who could've used this alternative escape route!\"Apollo: What's that, Mr. Wright?Phoenix: This is a certain person's very interesting psych profile. \"The subject... doesn't experience feelings like normal people do.\" In other words, this person doesn't feel happiness, sadness, or fear.Apollo: Doesn't feel... fear?Edgeworth: ............W-Wright...! You can't be serious?!Phoenix: Without the constraint of fear... ...he could easily do what an ordinary person wouldn't dare! Just as you or I could do a broad jump on the ground without the slightest fear... ...this \"subject\" could make a twenty-foot leap, fifty feet up in the air. He could choose this extreme way of escaping without hesitation!Apollo: So you're saying that to a person without fear... ...the alternative route would be quicker and eliminate the chance that they'd be spotted? That's definitely pretty extreme, Mr. Wright!Judge: But was there such a person at the scene?Phoenix: Yes, the phantom, that mysterious, shadowy figure who keeps popping up...Judge: Oh dear!Edgeworth: The phantom... again...?!Phoenix: I knew the phantom was there behind the scenes of the Space Center bombing. But I wasn't sure if he was connected to the murder of Clay Terran as well. However, now it's all clear! The phantom is the one who not only bombed the Space Center, but also killed Mr. Terran!Edgeworth: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA--Apollo: --AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!Judge: Order in the court! Order, I say! M-Mr. Wright, please continue!Phoenix: There were just too many similarities between this case and the one from seven years ago. \"But why?\" you may ask. It can only be because both incidents are the work of the same phantom!Apollo: So then, this \"phantom\"... is the one who killed Clay...?! But who IS he?!Phoenix: (This phantom has been haunting this case, pulling the strings in the background... Who could this unidentified, international spy be?)Edgeworth: Wright, this escape route must've been a part of the phantom's plan from the start. As was tricking Director Cosmos into switching the launch pads. The bomb on the second floor was meant to make the elevators and stairs unusable. That's why he gave advance warning and planted the bombs where he did.Phoenix: Yes, I think you're right. ............But it doesn't explain this one last thing.Aura: So I lowered my emergency ladder like the detective leading the evacuation told me to. But it was such a pain. Why couldn't they have used the ladders in the other rooms?Phoenix: The robotics lab wasn't the only room with an emergency ladder. But he couldn't have made that leap unless he was certain which one it would be.Apollo: So, you mean... ...the phantom was someone who knew that particular ladder was going to be used?Phoenix: That's right.Judge: Hmm... Who could it be?Phoenix: ............Wait a minute...\"So I lowered my emergency ladder like the detective leading the evacuation told me to.\"Phoenix: Ms. Blackquill lowered the ladder... after being told to by the detective leading the...? ............AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! (Y-You've gotta be kidding me!)Edgeworth: Did you figure it out, Wright? Do you know who the phantom is?!Phoenix: Yes, I do...Apollo: Wh-Who is it?! Who killed Clay?!Phoenix: (Our mystery spy, known as the phantom, is none other than...!)Present Bobby Fulbright profile Leads to: \"After the explosions, a member of the staff crossed paths with a certain detective.\"Present anyone else Phoenix: Judge: Unbelievable! This person is the spy?! Phoenix: That's right. We were all completely fooled! Edgeworth: Your Honor, please don't be fooled by Mr. Wright here. He picked that person without putting any thought into it at all. Judge: Mr. Wright! How dare you take me for a foolishly foolish fool! Unacceptable! Phoenix: But I don't, Your Honor! And I'll prove it! (After the explosions, somebody gave the order to lower that emergency ladder. That person is the phantom!) I promise to reveal who the phantom is this time, Your Honor! Leads back to: \"Our mystery spy, known as the phantom, is none other than...!\"After the explosions, a member of the staff crossed paths with a certain detective.\"I was on duty on the fourth floor. It was quite the madhouse, I tell you!\"Phoenix:As for the detective who was leading the evacuation from the fourth floor... ...he had a very specific objective in mind.\"So I lowered my emergency ladder like the detective leading the evacuation told me to.\"Phoenix:His objective was to secure his own escape route!\"We lowered an emergency ladder from a fourth floor window and escaped that way. Once everyone else got out safely, I made my way down too, and headed to the shelter.\"Phoenix:This is a detective you all know. He's even the lead detective on the current case... He appears to be a very emotional man, but his psych profile says he is without emotion.Edgeworth: What?! Are you saying...?!Apollo: Y-You mean the phantom is...?!Judge: D-Detective Bobby Fulbright?!Phoenix: Exactly. We were all taken in by his fake persona. Detective Fulbright's real identity is the phantom!Judge: Order! Order in the court...! Mr. Wright! How could this be?Phoenix: That's easy, Your Honor. Detective Fulbright was leading the fourth floor evacuation effort. Our first clue is that he made no attempt to have any other ladder put to use. The ladder in the robotics lab is the only one he ordered to be lowered. The second is that he directed everybody to the basement shelter via this ladder.Edgeworth: Verily! It was all a part of his plan to create an escape route!Phoenix: After Detective Fulbright saw to it that the ladder was lowered from the robotics lab... ...he went to the lounge, where he killed Clay Terran, and escaped into the Space Museum. The Museum started moving, slowly, so he waited for the right time, got a running start... And just as the corridor was passing the ladder... he leaped onto it!Edgeworth: Grr... I don't believe it... That addlepated detective did all that...?!Apollo: Was it really him...? I mean, all this time, I thought...Apollo: Sorry, we didn't catch your name.Fulbright: My name? I'm Bobby Fulbright! The heroic detective who defends our good citizens from evil! The champion of justice who comes running whenever you're in need! And my catchphrase? It's \"In justice we trust!\"Athena: Then... his concern for Simon... was also all just one big act...?Fulbright: I swore to reform Prosecutor Blackquill and make him a valued member of society again... ...so I can't just sit by and watch him give in to his emotions, and tear the defendant apart!Apollo: THAT monster killed Clay?! He--! He had me completely fooled! Come to think of it, he's the one who brought that bloodstained lighter to court, too! The scumbag even made me turn on Athena! Damn it! How the hell did I fall for all that?!Edgeworth: For him to have wormed his way into the police department as well... Nnrgh!Phoenix: Your Honor, the defense demands to question Detective Bobby Fulbright!Judge: Hmm... Yes, I agree that we need to hear from him right away. The court will take a short recess, and then Detective Fulbright will take the stand!December 20, 5:23 PMDistrict Court - Defendant Lobby No. 5Athena: Thank you so much, Mr. Wright! If it wasn't for everything you did, I... I...Phoenix: Don't thank me yet. We still have an uphill battle to fight.Athena: You got it, Boss!Apollo: ............Athena: A-Apollo...! ............Phoenix: (Ugh... Well, this is awkward...)Apollo: Athena, can you do me a favor?Athena: Huh? What is it?Apollo: Could you............ punch me, please?Athena: Wh-What?! Why should I do that?!Apollo: Because I should've believed in you! I let the seed of doubt inside me get the best of me. I'm really sorry that I didn't trust-- OUCH!Athena: Don't be such a dope! I was really touched by what you did!Apollo: ............Huh? Now what are YOU talking about?Apollo: I... I want to believe in Athena. I really do. But what is faith without doubt? That's why... I need to question her guilt! So that once the truth finally comes out, I can really, fully trust her!Athena: You took the time and effort to genuinely think about who I am and what I'm made of... After all that, how could I punch a true friend like you, Apollo?Phoenix: (You didn't have any trouble slapping him a second ago...)Apollo: Thanks, Athena. And thanks for waking me up to reality again.Phoenix: (Guess I know now who to call if I ever get sleepy in court...)???: It looks like you have some promising young people working under you.Phoenix: ...Edgeworth. Yeah. I think they're pretty great, myself. (And they're not afraid to keep me in line...)Edgeworth: Anyway, I have some very good news. Aura Blackquill has surrendered and the hostages have been set free.Phoenix: Trucy and all the others...?! Oh, thank goodness!!!Edgeworth: ............Ms. Blackquill said she had something she really needed to do. So I granted her special permission to do what she must.Phoenix: I wonder what it is? Ms. Blackquill!Aura: ............I didn't come to apologize, if that's what you're thinking. My actions are what allowed the truth of what happened seven years ago to come to light. But I did come because I had something to say to all of you.Clonco: Miss Aura...Phoenix: (She'd better not be here to complain about something...)Edgeworth: ............Ms. Blackquill, I want to apologize to you. The fact that you couldn't trust the court system is our fault.Aura: Ha ha ha! Yes, it's true the courts are filled with incompetent idiots. Still... I suppose I could let you handle the rest of this case for me.Clonco: Oh, Miss Aura! Does this mean you're starting to trust the system again?!Aura: No, of course not! Be quiet, Hunk of Junk! It's just... I wouldn't mind if you were the ones who took Metis's killer down.Apollo: Leave it to us! We'll get him!Phoenix: (So I guess that means she's starting to trust US at least...)Blackquill: ...Aura.Aura: Simon. I'm so glad both you and the princess were cleared of all suspicion. And it's all thanks to me and my robots. You'd better be grateful.Blackquill: Hmph. I never imagined you would go that far... though you always were extreme. But I don't recall ever requesting your help.Aura: As closed as ever, I see. Well, now that you've been released, I guess it's my turn to go live in the slammer. I just hope you're not the prosecutor for my trial. You'd probably give me the death penalty.Blackquill: ...Hmph. You know me all too well.Phoenix: (I guess love can take on a variety of expressions, including stunted in their case...)Blackquill: ............But I truly was about to be executed tomorrow. Though, because of you, it looks like I won't be crossing the Styx just yet. ............You have my heartfelt thanks, Aura. I'm sorry I caused you so much anguish.Aura: Simon... ............ *sniffle* I'm so glad, Simon. So very glad to hear you say that...Blackquill: Aura...Aura: ...All right. That's enough of that... Bailiff, take me to the Detention Center.Phoenix: (What Ms. Blackquill did was inexcusable... ...but it's clear she did it out of love for her brother...)Athena: I still can't wrap my mind around Detective Fulbright being the phantom...Apollo: I...! I can't believe he killed Clay!Blackquill: Right. And murdered my mentor, which brought great distress upon little Athena. ......Chief Prosecutor.Edgeworth: Yes...?Blackquill: I would ask a favor. Would you allow me to stand at the prosecutor's bench for this trial? I wish to claim the phantom's head by my own hand.Edgeworth: ...Hmph. That was my plan all along. After all... ...it's highly unconventional for a man of my position to stand in court.Blackquill: ............Sir...Edgeworth: The formal paperwork has yet to be filed, but you are hereby conditionally released. Please take the prosecutor's bench in your official capacity... ...and uncover the truth by your own hand.Blackquill: I'm much obliged... ...The day to part with these has come at last. Chief Prosecutor... could you?Blackquill: ............ ............How long have I waited. Maybe it's the sense of freedom, but even the air seems fresher, the light, brighter... And I will relish slashing that blackguard Fulbright to shreds without mercy.Phoenix: (I don't have to be able to read his heart to see how happy he is...)Athena: *sniffle* I'm so glad! But I won't... cry just yet! After all, we've still got a trial to finish!Phoenix: (It's okay to cry, Athena. I promise.)Apollo: Prosecutor Blackquill... Mr. Wright... Please avenge Clay's death for me.Phoenix: What are you talking about, Apollo? You're coming to the defense's bench with me.Apollo: I am?!Phoenix: Well, I can't expect Athena to assist me, now can I? She's the defendant. That leaves you, Apollo.Apollo: But... Are you sure you want me...? I... I took a leave of absence and everything...Phoenix: Well, our office is pretty short-handed, and you're all I've got.Apollo: Th-Thank you, Mr. Wright!Athena: Apollo.Apollo: Athena, I can say it with all my heart now. I believe in your complete innocence. And now we're going to prove it to the world!Athena: ...Thank you, Apollo! I know you can do it!Anime cutscene Phoenix: So... you won't be needing that eyepatch anymore, right?Apollo: Right! Because I'm fine now.Phoenix: Now THIS is the Apollo I know!Athena: Welcome back, Apollo!Edgeworth: It's almost time for the trial to restart, though it looks like you have things well in hand.Phoenix: Yup.Edgeworth: I should head back to the Prosecutor's Office.Athena: But why?Edgeworth: I want to look into a few things. Namely... ...the first people on the scene seven years ago, the facial data registered by the robot... ...and Detective Fulbright's background.Phoenix: Sounds great, Edgeworth. Thanks.Edgeworth: I expect to be repaid with a victory, Wright. Now, if you'll excuse me.Phoenix: Okay, you two all set to go?Apollo: You bet I am!Athena: Let's do this!Phoenix: (This is it, the final battle! The murder of Apollo's friend, the courtroom bombing incident... ...and the case that ushered in the dark age of the law seven years ago... Destiny has called us to bring the one responsible for it all to justice today!)December 20, 5:27 PMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 4Judge: Let us now reconvene.Phoenix: The defense is ready, Your Honor.Blackquill: The prosecution has never been more ready.Apollo: You know, this is the first time we've been at the defense bench together since I debuted.Phoenix: Not that you mention it... (Although, back then, I thought you were more loud than you were reliable...) You've really come a long way since then, Apollo. You've grown a lot.Apollo: Well, there have been some hiccups, but I guess I've done pretty well.Phoenix: (He's still got that ego of his, though.)Judge: ............Prosecutor Blackquill. With the seven-year mistake now resolved, you can finally take your rightful place... ...! Um, yes, I guess we can keep the chitchat for later...! B-Bailiff, please bring in the witness immediately!Apollo: Even with those handcuffs off, Prosecutor Blackquill seems to be pretty much the same.Phoenix: Seven years of grumpiness doesn't go away so easily, I guess.Fulbright: Ha ha ha ha! Bobby Fulbright here! I heard I was needed on the stand so I here I am!Judge: Detective Fulbright... Do you know why you have been called to give testimony?Fulbright: Yup! 'Cause there is only one reason why I'd be called! And that is, because it's time for justice! In justice we trust!Phoenix:Phoenix: You can't fool us with that act anymore! Your \"justice\" is nothing but lies!Fulbright: What?! Are you questioning the integrity of my sense of justice?! ............I mean, sure, sometimes I make mistakes, but hey...Apollo: ............He's acting exactly the same as always.Phoenix: Tell me about it. He must be feeling awfully confident...Blackquill: ............Fool Bright, if you wish to dispel our suspicions, then let's get to your testimony.Fulbright: All right. Fine! You want me to prove my righteousness? I can certainly do that!Witness Testimony-- The Embodiment of Justice --Fulbright: Ha ha ha ha! I am the very embodiment of justice itself! I won't have you make me into a villain with your far-fetched arguments! And this bit about the escape route is only a theory -- you don't have any proof! What we DO have is proof that Athena Cykes is the culprit: this lighter with her prints on it!Judge: Hmm... So you're saying the suspicions against you are completely false? And that the defendant is the real culprit?Fulbright: Th-That's right. Mr. Lawyer's escape route is totally circumstantial! He doesn't have any proof that I made a big leap onto a ladder!Blackquill: We don't have proof. You are correct about that. However, you don't have any proof for your claim, either.Fulbright: Ngaaagh! I-I guess you're right. But you can't define justice with evidence. Who can define it, anyway? Justice... just is!Apollo:Apollo: D-Don't make me......... break out a dictionary on you!Fulbright: Ngaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! Please, don't throw the book at me!Apollo: Ugh... Tell me the phantom didn't just make me set up a stupid pun for him.Phoenix: ...Let's just try not to lose focus, all right?Fulbright: But my justice is crystal clear! What's not clear are your eyes! Wake up and smell the justice!Blackquill:Fulbright: !Blackquill: Enough of your rubbish, Fool Bright. If you have even an ounce of justice, then you will answer the court's questions and prove it!Fulbright: ............Prosecutor Blackquill?Apollo: Prosecutor Blackquill looks torn.Phoenix: Well, Fulbright was his partner after all.Judge: Hmm... Prosecutor Blackquill is right. The truth will be revealed in the cross-examination. The suspicions against Detective Fulbright are, at this point, only suspicions. As is my duty, I will judge the claims against the detective as impartially as I can. Does anyone have any objections?Phoenix: That's fine, Your Honor.Fulbright: Ha ha ha ha! Now, ask away and don't hold back!Judge: Well, there don't appear to be any objections. Very well, Mr. Wright. Please begin your cross-examination.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Embodiment of Justice --Fulbright: Ha ha ha ha! I am the very embodiment of justice itself!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The \"embodiment of justice\"?! Those are just empty words! Fulbright: But they say if you keep saying something, it can eventually become the truth! Isn't that how people make their dreams come true, too? By wishing over and over? Phoenix: All right, all right. Let's just move on.Fulbright: I won't have you make me into a villain with your far-fetched arguments!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: My arguments are hardly \"far-fetched\"! There's careful reasoning behind my theory! Fulbright: Yes, well, apparently there's \"reasoning\" behind even a tofu burger. But what we have against Ms. Cykes, though, is not just \"reasoning,\" but solid evidence. And it's called the lighter, with Ms. Cykes's fingerprints on it in the victim's blood! Phoenix: Yes, that's true, but... (But wait... Detective Fulbright was the one who brought that evidence to the trial...) Blackquill: If you harbor any suspicions, I suggest you ask Fool Bright, Wright-dono. Especially about that lighter... Phoenix: (He's right. But what exactly should I ask about...?) The number of prints (before adding either statement) Phoenix: So, how many prints were found exactly? Fulbright: Three: the thumb, the index finger, and the middle finger of a right hand! Phoenix: Your Honor, that is an important statement! Could we please have it-- Fulbright: Added to my testimony? You got it! Judge: ...He beat me to it. Fulbright: Ha ha ha! Be it investigating or testifying, speed is the key! Adds statement \"Three prints were on the lighter: the thumb, index, and middle fingers of a right hand!\" The number of prints (after adding statement \"Three prints were on the lighter: the thumb, index, and middle fingers of a right hand!\") Phoenix: (No, wait a minute. He already answered this one. He's even added a statement about it to his testimony already.) Leads back to cross-examination The number of prints (after adding statement \"The prints were placed just the way they would be if someone were holding it lit.\") Phoenix: So, how many prints were found exactly? Fulbright: Three: the thumb, the index finger, and the middle finger of a right hand! Phoenix: Your Honor, that is an important statement!

Changes statement from \"The prints were placed just the way they would be if someone were holding it lit.\" to \"Three prints were on the lighter: the thumb, index, and middle fingers of a right hand!\" The position of the prints (before adding either statement) Phoenix: Please tell the court about the position of the prints on the lighter. Fulbright: They're around the same spot on either side, as they would be if she were holding it up. Phoenix: Hmm... I suppose if it was used to light the room, it would be held that way. Could you please add that statement to your testimony? Adds statement \"The prints were placed just the way they would be if someone were holding it lit.\" The position of the prints (after adding statement \"Three prints were on the lighter: the thumb, index, and middle fingers of a right hand!\") Phoenix: Please tell the court about the position of the prints on the lighter. Fulbright: They're around the same spot on either side, as they would be if she were holding it up. Phoenix: Hmm... I suppose if it was used to light the room, it would be held that way.

He already answered this one. He's even added a statement about it to his testimony already.) Leads back to cross examinationFulbright: And this bit about the escape route is only a theory -- you don't have any proof!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Then please tell us more about the circumstances surrounding the ladder. Fulbright: Well, I'd much rather expound on the topic of justice, but oh, all right. Phoenix: (Let's see. What should I ask about?) About Aura Blackquill (before adding either statement) Phoenix: Please tell the court what you remember about Ms. Blackquill at the time. Fulbright: She appeared to be really angry that the bombing commotion was disrupting her work. She even threw a robot at me. Phoenix: (Yikes. I hope it wasn't poor Clonco.) Fulbright: This is very important information, isn't it! I'll just add this statement then! Phoenix: (Um, why don't you let me decide that...?) Adds statement \"Ms. Blackquill was extremely crabby about having her work interrupted!\" About Aura Blackquill (after adding statement \"Ms. Blackquill was extremely crabby about having her work interrupted!\") Phoenix: (No, wait a minute. He already answered this one. He's even added a statement about it to his testimony already.) Leads back to cross-examination About Aura Blackquill (after adding statement \"The lab was very messy, so it was actually kind of a poor choice for the evacuation...\") Phoenix: Please tell the court what you remember about Ms. Blackquill at the time. Fulbright: She appeared to be really angry that the bombing commotion was disrupting her work. She even threw a robot at me. Phoenix: (Yikes. I hope it wasn't poor Clonco.) Fulbright: This is very important information, isn't it! I'll just switch this statement in! Phoenix: (Um, why don't you let me decide that...?) Changes statement from \"The lab was very messy, so it was actually kind of a poor choice for the evacuation...\" to \"Ms. Blackquill was extremely crabby about having her work interrupted!\" About the lab (before adding either statement) Phoenix: Please tell us anything you remember about the lab. Fulbright: The lab, huh? Well, it was so messy, there was hardly anywhere to step. I guess they were in the middle of building a giant robot. Phoenix: (Yeah, that's pretty much how it looked when we visited this afternoon, too.) Fulbright: Okay, I know the drill! You want me to add this statement to my testimony, don't you! Phoenix: What? No, um.. Fulbright: Way ahead of you! I'll just add it in! Adds statement \"The lab was very messy, so it was actually kind of a poor choice for the evacuation...\" About the lab (after adding statement \"Ms. Blackquill was extremely crabby about having her work interrupted!\") Phoenix: Please tell us anything you remember about the lab.

He already answered this one. He's even added a statement about it to his testimony already.) Leads back to cross-examinationFulbright: What we DO have is proof that Athena Cykes is the culprit: this lighter with her prints on it!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You mean the lighter that was found in the Space Museum, is that right? Fulbright: The one and only! After Ms. Cykes murdered Mr. Terran, she escaped into the Space Museum. That's when she probably dropped the lighter. Then, after the launch pads were switched, she ran out of the Space Museum... ...where her image was caught by the security camera! Phoenix: (Without evidence I should probably save this fight for another time...)Fulbright: Three prints were on the lighter: the thumb, index, and middle fingers of a right hand!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So three prints from a right hand were found on the lighter, huh? Are you certain of this? Fulbright: I'd stake my life on it! Apollo: Mr. Wright, isn't it odd he's saying the prints are from Athena's right hand? Phoenix: Why would you say that? Apollo: Well, think about it for a sec. Athena always wears that glove on her right hand, right? So there's no way she'd leave prints of those three fingers from her right hand. Phoenix: Hey, great point! (Why didn't I catch that one?) Detective Fulbright! I'm sure you heard our discussion just now. About how Ms. Cykes always wears a glove on her right hand! Fulbright: Ha ha ha! Well, I have only one thing to say to that! Do you have any evidence that she was wearing that glove at the time of the incident? Phoenix: ............I guess we don't. Fulbright: If you want to prove the defendant innocent, you'll have to ask better questions than that. Phoenix: (Like I need a lecture from you, Smiles McGoo... Hmm... Should I try asking him about something else?) The prints' position Phoenix: Please tell the court about the position of the prints on the lighter. Fulbright: They're around the same spot on either side, as they would be if she were holding it up. Phoenix: Hmm... I suppose if it was used to light the room, it would be held that way. I believe this is important. Please swap this statement into your testimony! Changes statement from \"Three prints were on the lighter: the thumb, index, and middle fingers of a right hand!\" to \"The prints were placed just the way they would be if someone were holding it lit.\" Let's just press on like this Phoenix: Let's proceed with your testimony, shall we? Fulbright: Ha ha ha ha! Certainly, certainly! Leads back to cross-examinationPresent Aura's Statement Phoenix: Leads to: \"You say the prints were from a right hand, is that correct?!\"Fulbright: The prints were placed just the way they would be if someone were holding it lit.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Yes, Ms. Blackquill did mention she saw a lit lighter being held up. Fulbright: Yup! Meaning the person Ms. Blackquill saw was the owner of the fingerprints! It just strengthens the argument against Ms. Cykes! Phoenix: (Ugh... This line of questioning is going to get me anywhere except Convictionland... Hmm... should I try asking him something else?) The number of prints Phoenix: So, how many prints were found exactly? Fulbright: Three: the thumb, the index finger, and the middle finger of a right hand! Phoenix: Your Honor, that is an important statement! Could we please have it-- Fulbright: Swapped into my testimony? You got it? Judge: ...He beat me to it. Fulbright: Ha ha ha! Be it investigating or testifying, speed is the key!

Fulbright: Ha ha ha ha! Certainly, certainly! Leads back to cross-examinationFulbright: Ms. Blackquill was extremely crabby about having her work interrupted!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: I'm beginning to wonder, is Ms. Blackquill ever NOT crabby? Fulbright: Well, they already took her down to the station, so it's a bit late to ask her now. Apollo: Just my opinion, but maybe it's best we DON'T ask her about that... Ever. Phoenix: (Hmm. Should I try asking the detective something else?) About the lab Phoenix: Please tell us anything you remember about the lab. Fulbright: The lab, huh? Well, it was so messy, there was hardly anywhere to step. I guess they were in the middle of building a giant robot.

You chose the ladder in that very room on purpose to create your escape route! Fulbright: That's not true! It's just that, when it comes to ladders, I'm very particular. I had a good feeling about that ladder! Apollo: Uh, this isn't getting us anywhere, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Huh? Did I mess up somewhere along the way?) About Aura Blackquill Phoenix: Please tell the court what you remember about Ms. Blackquill at the time. Fulbright: She appeared to be really angry that the bombing commotion was disrupting her work.

Leads back to cross-examinationBefore adding statement \"Three prints were on the lighter: the thumb, index, and middle fingers of a right hand!\" Apollo: It looks like he's sticking with Athena as the culprit. Phoenix: Ugh... And it doesn't help that he has the evidence... Apollo: Let's press him on everything until he cracks!After adding statement \"Three prints were on the lighter: the thumb, index, and middle fingers of a right hand!\" Apollo: Hmm... This statement that was added... I'm not sure if it's relevant or not. Phoenix: Well, at least he seems willing to answer our questions. Let's keep asking about different things and see if we can uncover an inconsistency.

The sins we've committed... and the sadness we've caused... No matter how far we run, our past remains... ...as ever-present as the moon in the sky. It looms in wait... for the day when we are forced to face it. But only in doing so can we truly make peace and move on in hope towards tomorrow. December 20, 1:23 PMWright Anything Agency Phoenix: (They took Athena from the courtroom, straight to the station. She's probably being questioned at this very moment.) ............ (After this past year, I took it for granted that those two would always be here. But now, Apollo has gone off on his own to seek his own truth... ...and my pursuit of the truth only ended up with Athena becoming the new suspect. Some boss I turned out to be...) Trucy: ............ It's even quieter in here than usual. Phoenix: Yeah... It seems so empty, too. Trucy: I just don't get it, Daddy. All of your reasoning during the trial seemed perfectly solid... Phoenix: Yeah... And I still believe it was... At least, based on what we know. Trucy: But now, Athena is the one who's being accused... Phoenix: During the trial for the bombing and murder that occurred at the Cosmos Space Center... ...the lighter used by the real culprit was found. This lighter proved the defendant, Solomon Starbuck, innocent. But Athena's prints were found on it instead... ...and she was subsequently arrested for the murder. Trucy: But Athena couldn't have done it. It just doesn't make any sense. Phoenix: (No, none of it does. I've been racking my brain, but I just can't figure it out! Argh! Where is the flaw in my reasoning? What have I got wrong in this case?) Trucy: You know, Daddy... if Athena was here... ...she wouldn't just be sitting around thinking. She'd be out there doing something. You ARE going to defend Athena, right, Daddy? Phoenix: Of course I will! And thanks, Trucy. I needed that push. (Trucy's right! The trial is tomorrow. There's no time to waste! If I'm going to prove Athena's innocence, I'd better get out there and find some evidence!) Trucy: Off we go, then! We're on a hunt for evidence that'll prove Athena's innocence! Phoenix: (Great! But before we go, I'd better tidy up the evidence I have on hand...) Unnecessary evidence left at the office. Phoenix: (Athena is probably still in the middle of being questioned... ...so Trucy's right. The thing to start with is talking to people at the Space Center.) Talk What to do Trucy: I still can't believe Apollo really left us... Phoenix: It was so sudden. Trucy: Maybe he got tired of being my assistant for my magic tricks? Phoenix: I don't think it's your fault, Trucy. Trucy: B-But I made him clean the toilet a lot! And I made him go bring in the newspaper! It WAS my fault! I just know it! Oh, Apollo! *sniffle* Phoenix: I really don't think it was your fault, Trucy. But I didn't realize Apollo was wearing so many hats around here, either. Any ideas? Trucy: How could they suspect Athena? It's just ridiculous. It must be some kind of conspiracy. Phoenix: A conspiracy, huh? Well, it certainly is some kind of mistake, that's for sure. Trucy: First of all, we have to bust Athena out of the Detention Center. Then we have to chase down the people who framed her. We'll sneak around the world, from Kiev to Carolina, with the fuzz hot on our tails! Phoenix: Isn't that exactly the same as the plot of the movie you watched the other day? Present Attorney's Badge Trucy: I guess presenting your attorney's badge... ...is like your \"quick trick,\" huh, Daddy? Phoenix: Ha ha ha. So it's just a trick to you, huh? Trucy: Well, you are one of the talents in our Wright Anything Agency, after all. But I have to say that an attorney's badge won't get many laughs... Phoenix: I don't care if I get laughs, as long as I can clear my client's name. Trucy: Ha ha ha! That's a good one, Daddy! Phoenix: I'm no match for you, though, Trucy. Space Center Pamphlet Trucy: Space, huh... I'd sure love to go up there someday. Will you take me, Daddy? Phoenix: Ha ha ha. It's not like taking somebody to an amusement park, you know. Trucy: Well, you hardly ever take me to one of those, either! You either say, \"I don't have any money\" or \"I don't have time\"! Phoenix: F-Fine. I'll take you on my next day off. Trucy: You're the best, Daddy! Phoenix: Ha ha ha. (I'm no match for Trucy...) Anything else Trucy: Daddy, you should be careful about showing evidence to a magician. Phoenix: That's true. You can make anything disappear. Trucy: Well, anything up to about a yard in diameter, anyway. My magic panties are an extra-dimensional space! Phoenix: I guess only a space probe can help us figure out how they work then, huh. December 20Cosmos Space Center - Entrance Phoenix: Director Cosmos! Do you have a minute?! Cosmos: Urgk! Galactic Scooter! Full speed ahead! Phoenix: Director! (He scooted away...) Trucy: His expression changed the instant he saw you, Daddy! Phoenix: (Yeah, well, I dragged his name through the mud pretty good at the trial earlier today...) December 20Cosmos Space Center - Boarding Lounge Phoenix: We were here only yesterday... Oh, hey! Mr. Starbuck! You've been released, huh? Starbuck: Yup. And I came straight here. This is all thanks to you and your team, Mr. Wright! You've given me a second chance to fly into space again. I can't thank you enough. Except... Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... Phoenix: Wh-What's wrong? (I thought he'd be happy to be acquitted...) Starbuck: As I was coming out of the Detention Center, I saw Miss Cykes. Phoenix: (H-He saw Athena?) Starbuck: I was at a loss for words. I didn't know what to say to the poor girl. And then, you know what? She flashed a peace sign at me. \"Congratulations on your acquittal,\" she said. \"Now you can go back into space someday.\" Phoenix: (Yeah, that sounds like Athena. I can just picture it.) Starbuck: But I saw her eyes. They were red and swollen from crying. She's gotta be suffering! She must be so worried! And yet she went out of her way to be nice and give me that big smile! Trucy: She held back her own tears so she could give someone else a smile. That's... so Athena. Starbuck: There's no question about it. That girl is innocent. Please, Mr. Wright. You have to make sure she goes free! And then, they can put me in prison instead! I don't mind! Phoenix: (We can't have that either, Mr. Starbuck!) Don't worry, Mr. Starbuck. I'm going to give her the very best defense I can. I promise to get her acquitted, just like I did for you. Starbuck: I know she'll be all right with you in her corner. I know you'll never give up on her. Apollo has a fine boss to look up to! Talk About the murder Starbuck: I still can't believe Launch Pad 1 was switched with the Space Museum... Phoenix: What could have made Director Cosmos do such a thing? Starbuck: I haven't the foggiest idea. Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... So there never was gonna be a launch that day, not from the very beginning... I wonder if Clay knew...? Phoenix: I imagine he must have. Surely he would've noticed when you went to board the rocket. Starbuck: It's pathetic to think I was the only one who got taken in. Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... But I guess that's about how it goes, when you're worth less than space debris. Trucy: Is he... going to be all right, Daddy? His expression looks as dark as a black hole... Phoenix: Well... That's just how he is. The murderer (appears after \"About the murder\") Phoenix: Mr. Starbuck, do you remember anything about the murderer? Starbuck: Not really. I only saw a shadowy figure in the dark after all. Phoenix: (Yeah, I guess that was a little too much to hope for...) Starbuck: Hey, I heard something from the police, though. They said they never did find a .10-caliber gun down that trash chute. Phoenix: Just as I thought. The culprit must've carried it away with them when they escaped. Trucy: So, was the person you saw holding a gun, Mr. Starbuck? Starbuck: Umm... I couldn't really tell. Phoenix: But it wasn't Athena, right? Could you tell if the person was male or female, tall or short? Starbuck: I-I can't even tell you that much. Man, I'm useless... When the culprit opened the door and some light came in, I should've been able to see... Phoenix: The door... Ah, yes... As I recall, they opened this door here as they made their escape... Trucy: The door to Launch Pad 1, right? Starbuck: Yeah, except, right now, the door leads to the Space Museum. Phoenix: You mean the launch pad and the Space Museum are switched right now? Starbuck: Yeah, they're trying to investigate the theory you came up with in court. Phoenix: So they're recreating the conditions, huh? (I'd like to see what's beyond that door now.) Mr. Starbuck, could you open this door for us? Starbuck: Sure. Just let me have my prints scanned here... The murderer (subsequent times) Phoenix: Mr. Starbuck, do you remember anything about the murderer? Starbuck: Not really. I only saw a shadowy figure in the dark after all. Phoenix: (Yeah, I guess that was a little too much to hope for...) Starbuck: Hey, I heard something from the police, though. They said they never did find a .10-caliber gun down that trash chute. Phoenix: Just as I thought. The culprit must've carried it away with them when they escaped. Trucy: So, was the person you saw holding a gun, Mr. Starbuck? Starbuck: Umm... I couldn't really tell. Phoenix: But it wasn't Athena, right? Could you tell if the person was male or female, tall or short? Starbuck: I-I can't even tell you that much. Man, I'm useless... When the culprit opened the door and some light came in, I should've been able to see... Switching the launch pads (appears after \"The murderer\") Leads to: \"Do the launch pads get switched back and forth a lot?\" Present Terran's Autopsy Report Starbuck: Clay always used to cheerfully greet me in a loud voice. Phoenix: And he did vocal exercises every morning, sometimes until he was hoarse, right? Starbuck: Exactly. You could always hear him, even through the wall-- Hey, wait a minute. Did you know Clay? Phoenix: No, but like attracts like, as they say. Anything else Phoenix: Do you know anything about this piece of evidence? Starbuck: No... Sorry I'm so useless... Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangh... Phoenix: No, no. It's all right. There's no need to get all depressed! Phoenix: Do the launch pads get switched back and forth a lot? Starbuck: Well, back when the Space Museum was Launch Pad 2... ...they used to switch the pads around at times. Phoenix: But these days, Launch Pad 2 is only used as a tourist attraction, right? Starbuck: Right. 'Cause, quite frankly, the Space Center needs the money. Phoenix: (I hear you... Times sure are tough...) Trucy: Daddy, let's go check out what's beyond that door! Phoenix: Sure. Let's go. Starbuck: Hey, why don't I come along? I can show you around! Examine Leaves Phoenix: Huh? I wonder what these dead leaves are doing here? Trucy: Maybe they were stuck to the bottom of somebody's shoes. There are lots of trees around the Space Center. Phoenix: (She's right. It's a modern, state-of-the-art building, but it's surrounded by trees.) But I don't know. If they were stuck to the bottom of somebody's shoes... ...wouldn't they look more crushed up? These don't look like they've been stepped on. Trucy: Maybe there's some kind of secret hatch in the corridor, and they came in that way? Phoenix: Not everything is set up like a magician's stage, you know. Fingerprint scanner Phoenix: So this is another one of those devices for opening the door, huh? Starbuck: Yup. But this one doesn't require fingerprint verification. You just hit the button and \"open sesame\"! Trucy: So when you and Clay went through here, you didn't need to show your prints, either? Phoenix: That's right, Trucy. Just like how the culprit didn't need to scan their prints... ...when they escaped back out of the Space Museum corridor into Boarding Lounge 2. Launch Pad 1 Door Lock updated in the Court Record. Fingerprint scanner (subsequent times) Phoenix: So this is another one of those devices for opening the door, huh? Starbuck: Yup. But this one doesn't require fingerprint verification. You just hit the button and \"open sesame\"! Trucy: So when you and Clay went through here, you didn't need to show your prints, either? Phoenix: That's right, Trucy. Just like how the culprit didn't need to scan their prints... ...when they escaped back out of the Space Museum corridor into Boarding Lounge 2. After examining leaves and fingerprint scanner: Phoenix: (Well, I don't see anything else that jumps out at me. And I imagine this corridor is built exactly like the Launch Pad 1 corridor.) Talk Switching the launch pads Phoenix: Do the launch pads get switched back and forth a lot? Starbuck: Well, back when the Space Museum was Launch Pad 2... ...they used to switch the pads around at times. Phoenix: But these days, Launch Pad 2 is only used as a tourist attraction, right? Starbuck: Right. 'Cause, quite frankly, the Space Center needs the money. Phoenix: (I hear you... Times sure are tough...) Trucy: So, right now, this Boarding Lounge 1 is connected to the Space Museum... Phoenix: I guess the police are trying to re-create the conditions of the crime. Trucy: And just now, when we checked the hallway on the other side of the door... Phoenix: Yeah, it looks like that door opens from the corridor side without fingerprint verification. Trucy: So when Clay and Mr. Starbuck went through, they didn't need to scan their prints, either. Phoenix: That's right. Just like how the culprit didn't need to scan their prints... ...when they escaped back out of the Space Museum corridor into Boarding Lounge 2. Trucy: And remember there were those dead leaves in the corridor? I wonder where they came from? Hmm... I still think maybe they were stuck to the bottom of somebody's shoes. Phoenix: (I don't know. Those leaves didn't look like they'd been stepped on to me...) December 20Cosmos Space Center - Entrance Cosmos: Urgn! Curse the wretch who sullied my good name! Reverse course and full speed away! Phoenix: Director Cosmos! Wait! Trucy: I'll handle this, Daddy! Take that! Cosmos: Gaaaaagh! The mobility system has been compromised! Phoenix: (Trucy's knife throw was a direct hit to one of his tires!) Trucy: And the streak continues! Phoenix: (Maybe I should've kept a closer watch on what tricks she's been practicing...) Cosmos: My dear, old battleship! We fought many a skirmish together! It has been an honor... Trucy: Daddy! He's going to blow that thing up! Phoenix: Nah. I bet all that button will do is make it go haywire again. Cosmos: ............Very well. I surrender. As a prisoner of war, I expect to be treated honorably. Talk Switching the launch pads Phoenix: Director Cosmos, when you were talking in court about switching the launch pads... ...you used your right to remain silent about the reason as to why. Phoenix: I'd like Director Cosmos to tell us... ...why he switched the two launch pads to begin with. Cosmos: Nnngh... Please... I can't... I... I exercise my right to remain silent... But I will say... my hands were tied... I was only doing what I could to keep my men from getting caught in that blast. Nngh... Nnnggggh... Cosmos: The center of the cosmos is shrouded in mystery! But I don't have any secrets left... ...now that my battleship has been destroyed and I've been taken prisoner! 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (No secrets left, huh? I beg to differ. Looks like I'll have to undo his Psyche-Locks if I want to get to the bottom of this.) Present Magatama Phoenix: 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Behind the Switching of the Launch Pads -- Phoenix: I want you to tell me everything you're hiding about the switching of the two launch pads. Cosmos: I refuse! You can't make me! I can hold out longer than anyone! Phoenix: (I hope I never get like this when I'm old... Now, let's see. Where to start?) This is how you explained your motive for switching the launch pads. You did it... To fool the bomber Phoenix: You said your motive was to fool the bomber, right? Cosmos: No, by then, the bomb had already been set. Switching the launch pads after the fact would have done nothing to fool the bomber. Phoenix: (Huh? Ugh, I guess I got it wrong.) Ha ha. That was just a little joke. Now I'll tell you what you really said at the trial. Leads back to: \"This is how you explained your motive for switching the launch pads. You did it...\" To prevent the bombing Phoenix: You said your motive was to prevent the bombing, right? Cosmos: Hmph. So what you're saying is... ...that even though I switched the launch pads to prevent the bombing from happening... ...it ended up happening anyway, and I am nothing but a big fool?! Phoenix: (Well, I never said that last bit...) Ha ha. That was just a little joke. Now I'll tell you what you really said at the trial. Leads back to: \"This is how you explained your motive for switching the launch pads. You did it...\" To save the astronauts Leads to: \"Thanks to you switching the launch pads, the astronauts escaped injury from the blast.\" Phoenix: Thanks to you switching the launch pads, the astronauts escaped injury from the blast. Instead, they safely boarded the Museum's rocket, far away from the actual explosion. Cosmos: Hmph! My astronauts were raring to go out on an authentic adventure in space! How do you propose I had them board a fake rocket without them noticing?! Phoenix: ...I agree you couldn't have done it without help. For one, they would have figured it out the instant they stepped into the Space Museum. You figured you could fool Mr. Starbuck once he'd been drugged with his medication, but... ...without the help of this person, it would've been impossible to pull your plan off. Present Clay Terran profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"You must have gotten Mr. Terran to help you.\" Present anyone else Phoenix: Phoenix: It wasn't this person, was it? Cosmos: Are we done here? I'm quite busy with the aftermath of the incident, you know. Phoenix: (Oh... Guess I was right about being wrong...) ...Well, I did say it \"WASN'T this person,\" didn't I? But I still contend that... Leads back to: \"...without the help of this person, it would've been impossible to pull your plan off.\" Phoenix: You must have gotten Mr. Terran to help you. Cosmos: Urghk! Phoenix: He stole the tranquilizers from his mentor's locker and slipped them to him. And then, with Mr. Starbuck in a daze, they boarded the replica rocket in the museum! Cosmos: Aaaaagh! Someone please help this poor prisoner of war! Phoenix: (How is he able to spin around like that...?) 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: If you really wanted to save the astronauts' lives... ...shouldn't you just have called off the launch? Cosmos: If I could have done that, do you think I would have gone to all that trouble?! Phoenix: (I guess he must've had a compelling reason why he couldn't call it off...) But how did you know to switch the pads in advance of the bombing incident? Cosmos: W-Well, that's because... nrgh... I was warned in advance. Once I received that warning, it was my duty to ensure my astronauts' safety! Phoenix: But it was just a warning. It could even have been a prank. Why did you believe in it so completely? Cosmos: B-Because I went to one of those \"mediums\" that everyone's talking about these days. Phoenix: Oh? I didn't realize channeling was back in vogue. ...Besides, I thought it was you yourself that got the warning via telephone. Cosmos: Yes, that's right! The bomber contacted me personally. My battleship is equipped with a special advanced communications system, you see! Phoenix: (AKA, a regular ol' telephone.) Cosmos: \"It's been a while. Planning another launch? I see you haven't learned...\" I'll never forget the terror I felt when I received that call. Phoenix: The bomber said, \"It's been a while\"...? And that was enough to make you take the threat seriously? (Perhaps Director Cosmos took the threat so seriously... ...because the Space Center had been involved in a bombing once before? Maybe... ...the culprit in the current case is the same person who was involved in this incident!) The Courtroom No. 4 bombing Phoenix: It was the courtroom bombing, wasn't it?! That's when you were dealt a major blow! Cosmos: Do you really think blowing up a courtroom would've shaken the center of the cosmos? Phoenix: Gaaagh... (I guess I got it wrong... The director felt personally threatened, so it has to be something more relevant to him. ) Leads back to: \"...the culprit in the current case is the same person who was involved in this incident!\" The HAT-1 Miracle Leads to: \"The HAT-1 Miracle, that epic story of survival...\" The HAT-2 bombing Phoenix: The HAT-2 bombing. That must be where the answer to your secret lies. Cosmos: All hands! Ready the Galactic Scooter's main turrets! Teach this blockhead what a precision shot is all about! Phoenix: Aaaaaaagh! You got me! (Unh... I guess I was way off on that one... Now, let's see...) Leads back to: \"...the culprit in the current case is the same person who was involved in this incident!\" Phoenix: The HAT-1 Miracle, that epic story of survival... People across the nation know it now as a heroic tale of bravery. But in truth, it was an act of sabotage perpetrated by our current killer, wasn't it? Very few knew about the previous plot, so when the caller said, \"It's been a while\"... ...you knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that the danger was real, and it wasn't a prank! Cosmos: Gaaaaaaagh! Didn't anyone ever tell you to go easy on an ex-serviceman?! 1 LOCK BROKEN Cosmos: ...Yes, the HAT-1 Miracle was really a desperate battle against an act of sabotage. I even lost the life of one of my staff members in the fight. Phoenix: (Sabotage, murder... So this is the ugly truth behind the HAT-1 Miracle.) Cosmos: I let my guard down... I thought the saboteur had been caught, and that the case was closed. Phoenix: (...Huh? Wait a minute... The murder at the Space Center seven years ago...! This must be the person Director Cosmos thought was the culprit.) Present Simon Blackquill profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Simon Blackquill, the murder suspect in a case that happened here seven years ago.\" Present anyone else Phoenix: Cosmos: Mr. Lawyer, you must be very tired. Why don't you take a nap in one of our zero-gravity beds? Phoenix: (...I guess I picked the wrong person. Although I do like the sound of a zero-g nap right about now... But that will have to wait! I still have a Psyche-Lock left to break!) Leads back to: \"This must be the person Director Cosmos thought was the culprit.\" Phoenix: Simon Blackquill, the murder suspect in a case that happened here seven years ago. That place and time of the two incidents -- the murder and the sabotage -- were the same. So you thought that he committed both crimes. But while Prosecutor Blackquill was behind bars, you got another threatening call. If the culprit this time is the same as seven years ago, then it isn't Simon Blackquill. Realizing that, you were shaken. It meant the true culprit's been running free all this time. Cosmos: Ngaaagh... How do you keep seeing straight through me?! 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Switching the launch pads (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Phoenix: (The reason why Director Cosmos won't talk about why he switched the launch pads... ...is connected to the truth behind the HAT-1 Miracle. The sabotage and murder that happened at this Space Center seven years ago...) Director Cosmos, tell us what you're hiding! Cosmos: If you really want to understand the reason I decided to switch the launch pads... ...we'll have to start with the story of that horrible nightmare from seven years ago. Phoenix: Seven years ago... You mean the so-called \"HAT-1 Miracle\"? Cosmos: The launch went smoothly, but once the ship entered outer space, then the troubles began. It was all the handiwork of a certain person and their evil scheme. Phoenix: (So Mr. Starbuck's traumatic experience wasn't accidental...) Cosmos: Not only that, but before the launch, a very valuable piece of moon rock was stolen. But that wasn't the worst of it! One of my staff members was murdered! Trucy: Wow. I had no idea such awful events were behind that exciting story of space heroism... Cosmos: All that, in spite of the Space Center having very strict security in those days. All personal effects were examined thoroughly, coming or going. You couldn't even smuggle a withered old leaf through those checkpoints! Phoenix: So... do you have any clue who was responsible for the sabotage...? Cosmos: At the very least, I know it wasn't Simon Blackquill. I don't know enough to identify the true culprit, but it's clear WHAT that person is. To put it simply............ a spy. Trucy: A spy?! You mean somebody who infiltrates a foreign country... ...carries out dangerous missions, and always gets the girl?! Phoenix: (Someone's watching way too many late-night movies.) Well, I guess if we're talking about blowing up a rocket and stealing research material... ...it's not all that surprising that a spy could be behind it all. The spy (appears after \"Switching the launch pads\") Cosmos: Make no mistake! There's cutthroat rivalry between nations in the space R&D race. Some try to outdo others by any means possible, even deliberate obstructions. Seven years ago, we got a call before the launch warning us of sabotage. Phoenix: The same MO as this time... Cosmos: Yes. And here I thought the perpetrator had been caught, but it looks like I was wrong. Trucy: Prosecutor Blackquill seems more like a ninja than a spy, don'tcha think? Phoenix: (Aren't ninjas and spies basically the same thing?) Cosmos: But there's a good reason we failed to find the real spy... ...A massive cover-up by the government. Government officials were too embarrassed to admit... ...that they had allowed such a thing to happen at the hands of a spy. Phoenix: Don't tell me they made the police rush the investigation? Cosmos: They did indeed. And then, to cover up the sabotage, they cleaned up the story. Phoenix: And that was \"The HAT-1 Miracle,\" wasn't it? (But then, seven years later, the same MO -- advance warning of sabotage... That must've been the director's reason for switching the launch pads.) Just like seven years ago (appears after \"The spy\") Phoenix: Seven years ago, the spy gave you advance warning of their plans, just like this time. That was what made you decide to switch the launch pads, wasn't it? Cosmos: That's right. The caller knew the facts of the case seven years ago, despite the cover-up. They knew about the sabotage, the moon rock, the murder. And they said... ...\"You don't want things to go like they did seven years ago, do you?\" I immediately thought of calling off the launch, but the government wouldn't let me! \"We don't give in to the likes of terrorists! We must proceed for our country's honor!\" It was quite a moving speech, actually. Phoenix: (\"Moving\"? Really? Maybe if you're easily inspired by political talking points...) Cosmos: But I knew the truth. We had been warned, which meant that the danger was very real. And I knew there was no way to stop the spy. No matter what I did, they would find a way. That's why I switched the launch pads, and staged the moving rescue scene. First, I snuck into the Center the night before and switched the launch pads. That way, the astronauts would go from Boarding Lounge 1 to the Space Museum. Then, I put a \"closed for repairs\" sign at the door to Launch Pad 1 in Boarding Lounge 2. Phoenix: You did that so normal visitors wouldn't enter, right? What else did you do? Cosmos: I enlisted the help of several staff members, including Terran. Phoenix: But you didn't let Mr. Starbuck in on it? Cosmos: He'd already been through enough, and he's no good at lying to keep a secret... I'm afraid I had no choice but to have him drugged. My plan went well, until... Trucy: ...Clay's murder, huh... Cosmos: After the culprit made their escape, I switched the launch pads back. I did it in such a way that no one would find out. But after all that effort... ...Terran is dead, and the HAT-2 is destroyed! And the Hope capsule, which had returned to us only recently, was also lost in that blast! My home, the center of the cosmos... my beautiful Cosmos Space Center is done for! Phoenix: (Wait, what did he mean by the Hope capsule was lost in that blast...?) The \"Hope\" capsule (appears after \"Just like seven years ago\") Phoenix: I thought that the Hope capsule was found at the crime scene with Mr. Terran. It had just been brought back by the Hope space probe with asteroid samples inside. Phoenix: So what kind of samples are they? What's in them? Cosmos: ............The samples are scheduled for analysis in the near future. We haven't had time, since they just came back the day before Terran's murder. Cosmos: The capsule was being held in a safe in Launch Pad 1... ...but I gave it to Terran before the incident so it wouldn't be destroyed in the explosion. The idea was that, with it safely in Terran's possession... ...he could make it look like he rescued it during the staged \"miraculous escape.\" But our precious research materials... ended up lost to that explosion anyway... Trucy: But I thought Clay was supposed to keep it safe? Cosmos: You misunderstand. The launch pad explosion wasn't the one the capsule was lost to... It was lost after the police confiscated it as evidence. It was the courtroom bombing from the other day. The capsule was there in the courtroom as evidence, and was blown to smithereens! Phoenix: (Yet another casualty of that blast...) Cosmos: Ultimately, I think the culprit may have known about the switching of the launch pads. Phoenix: What? H-How? Cosmos: The police found a wiretapping device during their investigation today. A bug aboard my battleship, a tap on my advanced communications system! Phoenix: A wire on that phone? Cosmos: Yes... A wire on this very phone. I used this phone to give instructions to my staff about the launch pad switch. Just to the few select members who knew about the plan. Just before the incident, staff members were coming in and out of Launch Pad 1. The culprit probably slipped in with them amid the confusion... Phoenix: And planted the bomb then... Yes, if they were tapping your phone, they definitely could pull something like that off. So you really think the same spy is behind this incident and the one seven years ago? Cosmos: Yes. I'm sure of it. Phoenix: Then, this spy... must be the \"phantom\" Prosecutor Blackquill has been chasing... Fulbright: But Prosecutor Blackquill told me once... \"The hunt I've been on for the phantom of seven years past continues even still.\" Fulbright: For starters, that case happened right here at this very Space Center, too. Trucy: So if we can find this \"phantom\"...! Phoenix: That's right. We can clear Athena's name. And then there's the matter of Prosecutor Blackquill, too. Trucy: What about him? Phoenix: Well, IF the culprit of seven years ago is the same person as in the current incident... ...it would mean Prosecutor Blackquill is innocent. That's still an \"if,\" though... Trucy: Hmm... I wonder how dangerous that guy would be in court without handcuffs...? But if we're going on a ghost hunt, count me in! Cosmos: Hee hee hee... Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! It's all over for me! Spin! Spin! Whirl! Whirl! I'm done for! The center of the cosmos is doomed! Trucy: Do you think he's going to be all right, Daddy? Phoenix: Well, at least he'll be in good company. There must be planets out there he can spin with. Which reminds me... I'd like to delve a little deeper into the HAT-1 mission, too. Cosmos: If you want to learn more, start with the Space Museum. There's a HAT-1 exhibit there. Oh, don't mind me. I'll just keep spinning here and see how the cosmos unfolds... Trucy: It's like he achieved spiritual enlightenment or something! Phoenix: I'm sure he'll stop when he gets dizzy. Let's go visit the Space Museum! The \"Hope\" capsule (subsequent times) Phoenix: I thought that the Hope capsule was found at the crime scene with Mr. Terran. It had just been brought back by the Hope space probe with asteroid samples inside. Phoenix: So what kind of samples are they? What's in them? Cosmos: ............The samples are scheduled for analysis in the near future. We haven't had time, since they just came back the day before Terran's murder. Cosmos: The capsule was being held in a safe in Launch Pad 1... ...but I gave it to Terran before the incident so it wouldn't be destroyed in the explosion.

Yes, if they were tapping your phone, they definitely could pull something like that off. Present Clay's Autopsy Report or Utility Knife Cosmos: What a shame. Truly. Clay was so young... He was an outstanding man who could have contributed greatly to the future of mankind. Phoenix: He was an exceptional man, wasn't he. Cosmos: If he had gone into space, my reputation would have grown even loftier! Why did he have to die before he went into space?! Phoenix: (Someone needs to teach him he is not the literal center of the cosmos...) Space Center Pamphlet or \"Hope\" Capsule Cosmos: Mankind's crowning achievement, the HAT-1 mission, will be in textbooks across the land! Phoenix: Wow. That historic, huh? Cosmos: My achievements are grand enough to rival the very birth of space itself! My life will be a legend that will be told millions of years into the future! You may proceed to admire and praise me now! Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Phoenix: Ha ha... You certainly are an amazing piece of work. Anything else Phoenix: Excuse me, but about this piece of evidence... Cosmos: Let me ask YOU a question. What will that object contribute to the future of mankind?! Phoenix: What? Uh, not much, I guess... Cosmos: Hmph. Then how important could it be? Quite unlike the great historical figure, Yuri Cosmos! Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Phoenix: (If he's any more self-absorbed, he'll turn into his very own black hole.) Before clearing \"The \"Hope\" capsule\" Talk option in Cosmos Space Center - Entrance: December 20Cosmos Space Center - Space Museum Trucy: Wow... The place is crawling with cops. Phoenix: Looks like we won't get any investigating done here now. Let's come back later. After clearing \"The \"Hope\" capsule\" Talk option in Cosmos Space Center - Entrance: December 20Cosmos Space Center - Space Museum Trucy: Let's see... Where's the exhibit on the launch seven years ago...? Phoenix: There, that's the HAT-1 exhibit. Trucy: Oh, wow! Look at that photo of the team! Phoenix: There's Clay, and Mr. Starbuck, Director Cosmos, Aura Blackquill, and even Ponco. ...But I've never seen the woman on the right before. Trucy: Everybody looks so happy! ...Well, except for Director Cosmos. Phoenix: Let's check out the newspaper article, too. \"HAT-1 Launch Imminent\"... And there's a photo of the Hope space probe. I guess it's only natural it doesn't talk about the murder or the sabotage. Trucy: They really were keeping it a secret, just like the director said. Daddy, take a look at that jacket... Phoenix: It must be the HAT-1 team's uniform jacket. It's the same design as the one Apollo was wearing, the one that belonged to Clay. Trucy: \"Actual jacket worn by a HAT-1 team member,\" it says. Phoenix: Not a replica, huh? (I wonder if it was Mr. Starbuck's?) HAT-1 Exhibit added to the Court Record. ???: Hello...? Phoenix: Oh, Ms. Woods! What brings you here? Woods: I... I heard Thena got arrested, so I... ...I've been looking for you, Mr. Wright. I thought you might be here... at the scene... Phoenix: You must be so worried! But rest assured. I'm going to do my very best to defend her. Woods: Thena's going through such a hard time. I hope she doesn't lose heart. Even just coming back to this place must've been really difficult for her... Phoenix: Huh? You mean the Cosmos Space Center? Woods: What, you didn't know...? She used to live here, when she was a little girl. Phoenix: Sh-She did?! No, I didn't know... (No wonder she knew so much...) Ms. Woods, could you tell me more, in detail? Talk Athena and the Space Center Woods: Thena's mom worked here. If I remember right, she was a doctor of psychology, or something like that... Phoenix: But why was a psychology specialist working at a space research facility? Woods: I don't really know. But I do know that she lived and worked here, so Thena lived here, too. Phoenix: So it was far from Athena's first time here. I wonder why she didn't mention it? Woods: She probably didn't want to talk about it. This place is connected to a very sad memory for her. Sad memory (appears after \"Athena and the Space Center\") Phoenix: A sad memory...? Can you tell me about it? Woods: There was a terrible incident here... It was seven years ago. Phoenix: (The same time frame as the HAT-1 launch...) Woods: Thena's mom... In the robotics lab... She was... murdered... Trucy: Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaat?! Woods: After it happened, Thena stopped coming to school. Phoenix: (Poor Athena... And all this time, she never let on at all...) Woods: I was so worried about her! I came here so many times, hoping to see her... But I never saw her again. Woods: After a while, we started exchanging letters... ...but I didn't get to see her face-to-face for seven long years. Phoenix: And so the first time you'd seen her in seven years was during Prof. Courte's case? Woods: That's right. And I was so surprised! She was like a completely different person, so cheerful and happy! Young Athena (appears after \"Sad memory\") Phoenix: What was Athena like as a child? Woods: She was very sensitive and kind. She didn't talk very much. She liked to draw and paint at home. Trucy: That's completely different from the Athena we know now. I can't even picture it... Woods: She never left the Space Center much because... ...she was very sensitive to other people's emotions. When she went to crowded places, she'd get dizzy from all the emotions flying around. Phoenix: (It must be hard to hear people's hearts as well as their voices...) Woods: She always wore these big, heavy-looking headphones. She said her mother made them for her, as part of her research. Phoenix: (Huh. I wonder what kind of research it was?) Woods: Because of her special ability, Thena couldn't handle being in school very often. And I was always out sick because of my weak constitution. Maybe that's why we became such good friends. We used to play together here at the Space Center a lot. It brings back memories. Trucy: Sounds like Athena's mother played a big role here at the Space Center. Ooh! Daddy, show her that picture! Phoenix: (Atta girl! Good idea.) Present HAT-1 Exhibit (after clearing \"Young Athena\" Talk option) Leads to: \"Ms. Woods, could you take a look at this for me?\" Anything else Woods: I'm very sorry, but I don't know anything about that... *cough* *cough, cough* Phoenix: Ack! Okay! Sorry to bother you! (I guess she doesn't have leads on that.) Phoenix: Ms. Woods, could you take a look at this for me? Woods: Oh, look! There's Thena's mom! The woman on the far right, the one in the kimono. That's Dr. Metis Cykes. Phoenix: Athena's mother's murder... ...did it by any chance have any connection to the HAT-1 launch? Woods: What? Why, yes... it did. As I recall, it happened on the day before the launch. Phoenix: Just as I suspected... Cosmos: But that wasn't the worst of it! One of my staff members was murdered! Phoenix: (So this is the murder Director Cosmos was talking about... Does that mean that the crime Prosecutor Blackquill was convicted of... ...is the murder of Athena's mother...?) There's a chance her death is somehow connected to the current case. Woods: Th-There is? Phoenix: Thank you for all your help, Ms. Woods. And please, try not to worry. I won't let anything happen to Athena. Woods: Thank you, Mr. Wright! I know you'll take good care of her. Trucy: So we need to investigate the robotics lab, and also talk to Athena. We've got our plates full, Daddy. I hope we can fit it all in before the day is through... Phoenix: The Detention Center first, then. We have to see Athena before visiting hours are over! December 20Detention Center - Visitor's Room Fulbright: Well! If it isn't Mr. Lawyer! Fancy meeting you here! Phoenix: Oh, hello, Detective Fulbright. Here on business? Fulbright: To tell the truth, I'm here to interview Ted Tonate! Phoenix: The one behind the courtroom bombing incident?! Fulbright: He suddenly said he's ready to tell the truth about that case! And what he was saying was so incredible, I just had to come right over to hear more. Trucy: Incredible? What was he saying? Fulbright: Why don't you hang around and hear it for yourself? Phoenix: ...Really? Us? Are you sure? Fulbright: Ha ha ha! I give you my special permission! Here comes the bomber now! Tonate: YOU! WHAT NERVE YOU HAVE TO COME HERE! YOU'RE HERE TO LAUGH AT ME, I SUPPOSE?! Phoenix: (Like I'd waste my breath on you. After all, you're the one who assaulted Apollo and put him in the hospital!) Tonate: VIOLENCE -> NO QUESTION -> OK Phoenix: \"No violence\"?! Too bad Apollo didn't get a chance to say that before you attacked him! Tonate: I... I... Phoenix: Fine. Then just answer me this, Mr. Tonate. What is this \"truth\" of yours about the courtroom you blew up? Tonate: NO! I DIDN'T DO IT! I DIDN'T BLOW UP THE COURTROOM! WHEN I KILLED DETECTIVE ARME, THERE WAS ANOTHER PERSON IN THE ROOM! Trucy: Wh... What are you talking about?! Who else could've been there?! Tonate: I SAW IT, I TELL YOU! I SAW SOMEONE'S HAND AS THEY WERE STEALING THE REMOTE SWITCH! THIS PERSON WAS THERE AND WITNESSED THE MURDER I COMMITTED! Phoenix: Wh-What?! Tonate: I DON'T KNOW WHO IT WAS... ...But that's who blew up the courtroom! Trucy: You expect us to buy that?! Phoenix: Easy there, Trucy... I don't see any Psyche-Locks... ...so I guess he must not be lying. Tonate: PARDON ME. I GOT A LITTLE CARRIED AWAY. BUT I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH. I DID NOT DETONATE THAT BOMB. Fulbright: And there you have it. We can't exactly ignore his claims, of course, so we're going a follow-up. We're even analyzing the bomb itself, or what's left of it! We haven't found any new facts yet, though. Phoenix: (Wow. They've laid it all out, piece by piece...) Tonate: OH, LOOK AT ALL THOSE BEAUTIFUL LITTLE PIECES! I... I WISH I COULD HAVE THEM... Phoenix: (Uh-oh. Looks like his geek switch has been activated...) Phony Phanty Bomb added to the Court Record. Fulbright: Well, I hope you're ready for Prosecutor Blackquill's special brand of questioning! Tonate: AAAGH... ANYTHING BUT THAT...! Fulbright: I'm afraid I have to be off now, too! I was just about to question Ms. Cykes. Trucy: You're going to see Athena now? Fulbright: That's right... Oh, did you folks come to see her? Sorry for the trouble, but could you come back later? Well, off I go! Phoenix: (What bad timing... Looks like we'll have to wait until after her questioning is over to see her.) Trucy: And after we came all this way, too! Well, I guess it's back to the Space Center. Let's go check out the robotics lab, Daddy. Phoenix: All right. Sounds like a plan. Present Phony Phanty Bomb Trucy: Hey! It's Phony Phanty! Phoenix: You know this character? Trucy: Yeah, it's the craze at my school, too. Phoenix: (I had no idea this thing was so popular.) Trucy: There are two camps: the Bum Rap Rhiny fans, and the Phony Phanty fans. Which side are you on, Daddy? Phoenix: Well, as a lawyer, I'd like to avoid both of them if I can help it. Entrance Present HAT-1 Exhibit Cosmos: Mankind's crowning achievement, the HAT-1 mission, will be in textbooks across the land! Phoenix: Wow. That historic, huh? Cosmos: My achievements are grand enough to rival the very birth of space itself! My life will be a legend that will be told millions of years into the future! You may proceed to admire and praise me now! Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Phoenix: Ha ha... You certainly are an amazing piece of work. Boarding Lounge Present HAT-1 Exhibit Starbuck: The HAT-1 mission experienced one crisis after another. It was almost like space itself was rejecting our efforts. That's what it felt like, anyway. Phoenix: But, in the end, the mission was a success. Starbuck: Yeah. People call it a \"miracle\"... ...but I think it was us who made it work somehow, through sheer will and hope. Phoenix: (A miracle through sheer will, huh? I think I know what he means all too well...) Space Museum Present HAT-1 Exhibit Phoenix: Ms. Woods, could you take a look at this for me? Woods: Oh, look! There's Thena's mom! The woman on the far right, the one in the kimono. That's Dr. Metis Cykes. Phoenix: Athena's mother's murder... ...did it by any chance have any connection to the HAT-1 launch? Woods: What? Why, yes... it did. As I recall, it happened on the day before the launch. Phoenix: Just as I suspected... Cosmos: But that wasn't the worst of it! One of my staff members was murdered! Phoenix: (So this is the murder Director Cosmos was talking about... Does that mean that the crime Prosecutor Blackquill was convicted of... ...is the murder of Athena's mother...?) There's a chance her death is somehow connected to the current case. Woods: Th-There is? December 20Cosmos Space Center - Robotics Lab Trucy: So this is the robotics lab, huh? Looks like it's exactly one floor above the boarding lounge. Phoenix: (...And where people were directed to evacuate from via the emergency ladder. This is where Athena's mother was killed seven years ago...) Speaking of someone who works with robots... Trucy: Daddy, look! Over there! Apollo: So they planned to use this bag to carry the capsule, is that right? Aura: Yeah, more or less. ...Say, why don't we stop talking about the case and have a nice cup of tea instead? Phoenix: (Apollo and Aura Blackquill? I wonder what they're talking about?) Aura: Well, well. Come to spoil our fun? Just when I was enjoying our alone time... Apollo: Trucy! And... Mr. Wright. Aura: If it's Apollo you want, you can't have him. He said he's investigating on his own. Phoenix: And I respect his wishes. We just came to investigate this lab. Aura: Well, this is MY lab, so you'll need MY permission if you want to do any snooping. Talk About what happened Aura: I heard about the trial. You made mincemeat out of the director. And suddenly Starbuck was out and your little subordinate, the princess, was in. Case closed. And they all lived happily ever after! Ha ha ha! Trucy: Grrrrr! Daddy, say something to her! Aura: And I suppose you're going to defend the princess in court, am I right? Phoenix: (\"The princess,\" huh? Guess she's talking about Athena...) Of course! Athena is innocent. Aura: Oh, my. Such loyalty and trust! She seems pretty suspicious to me, though. The emotionally unstable princess. There's your culprit for you. Don't you agree, Apollo? Apollo: I... I don't know yet. Trucy: Apollo! How could you?! Aura: What's wrong with saying \"I don't know\" if it's true? It's a very scientific approach. Your subordinate is more level-headed than you... Or should I say, \"former subordinate\"? Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: ............ Phoenix: (I can't believe it... Does Apollo really suspect Athena?!) Aura: ...Phew. All this laughing has worn me out. Your turn to say something, Hunk of Junk. Clonco: ............ Mr. Terran, you look pale. Shall I help you to the sickbay? Phoenix: \"Mr. Terran\"...? But that's Apollo you're talking to... Aura: Oh, this Hunk of Junk here is mistaking Apollo for Clay. Maybe Apollo is possessed by Clay's ghost. Clonco: Mr. Terran, how are you injuries? Mr. T-T-Terraaaaan... ...Mr. T-T-Terran, h-h-how are your injuries? Mr. T-T-Terraaaaaaaaaaaaaaan... Aura: I guess Clay intends to hang around to haunt the princess that murdered him. Oh, and to haunt the lawyer that defends her, too, of course. Phoenix: (A robot that can see ghosts? Yeah, right! And I'M a spirit medium!) Sorry, but apparently, scientists just don't tell very frightening ghost stories. I intend to defend Athena, no matter what you have to say about it. Aura: How perfectly foolish! That kind of blind belief makes people lose sight of the truth. ...Just like seven years ago. Seven years ago (appears after \"About what happened\") Phoenix: Could you tell me about the incident seven years ago? Aura: Why? Do you enjoy trampling on people's feelings and rubbing salt in their wounds? Or do you just want me to talk? Hmm, in that case, what should I ask for in return...? Apollo: I'd like to hear about that incident, too. It'd help me understand the current case better. Phoenix: (Huh? Apollo knows about that case, too...?) Aura: Well, if you're the one who's asking, Apollo... Come on, Hunk of Junk. You tell the story. Clonco: But Miss Aura, that's private information... Aura: Tsk! If you won't talk, I'll just have to make you talk! Clonco: G...Gaaagh! ...Yes! Who cares about personal privacy?! Not me! I am ready to utilize my blast processing abilities to impart all available information! Trucy: Wow, what a magic trick! He's like a completely different robot now! Clonco: The bodies of all the robots that come through this lab are designed by Miss Aura! I was born seven years ago! Miss Aura was much, much younger then! Phoenix: (Y-Yikes! Better watch what you say if you don't want to get recycled, Clonco!) Clonco: And then our hearts were created by that great genius, Dr. Metis Cykes! Phoenix: Hearts? Robots with hearts? Can you even make such a thing? Clonco: Emotions are not irrational things! Our logic and our hearts can be integrated! The two Navigation Companions created by Miss Aura and Dr. Metis transcend humans! Gaaagh! Aura: Metis... Phoenix: (Huh? She just glanced over at her desk.) Aura: Nobody could continue Metis's research. She and her work were truly one of a kind. And now the two Navigation Companions are all that are left of Metis here on Earth... Phoenix: (The robots are all that's left? Isn't she leaving out a very important someone...?) Aura: We built the ultimate creations together, but now she's gone! Apollo: I get the feeling Dr. Cykes loved her robots almost as much as she loved her daughter... ...and almost as much as she loved you. Aura: ...Ha ha ha ha ha! What are you talking about? Don't make me laugh! But you lost someone, too, didn't you, Apollo? Your friend Clay... I guess you and I are pretty much in the same boat. *sigh* Clonco: Miss Aura, would you like a tissue? Aura: Keep your trap shut, Hunk of Junk! Clonco and Ponco (appears after \"Seven years ago\") Trucy: Clonco is an important keepsake of your time with Dr. Cykes. You should treat him better! Aura: What does it matter? He doesn't feel pain, and I can always repair his body. Besides, their hearts aren't actually in their bodies. Phoenix: What do you mean by that? Aura: The program Metis wrote runs on a separate mainframe. Their bodies are controlled remotely from there. Their hearts and memories are there, too. These bodies are really just peripherals. So I can do anything I want to them! Phoenix: (I'm not so sure that gives you the right to physically abuse the poor things...) Aura: But why are you people looking into such an old case now, anyway? Phoenix: Well... we believe the culprit of that incident might be the same person as in this case. Trucy: So Daddy's going to find out who killed Dr. Cykes, too! (Changed from [So Dadddy's [sic] going to find out who killed Dr. Cykes, too!] in the original release) Aura: ............ I'm sure you're aware of who Metis's killer is? Phoenix: Yes, Prosecutor Blackquill... or so it seems. Aura: That's a quaint way of putting it. Are you implying you don't think he did it? Phoenix: I can't say anything for sure right now. But that's exactly why I'd like to hear your side of it, to help me be sure. Dr. Cykes and Simon (appears after \"Clonco and Ponco\") Leads to: \"I was the one who introduced Simon to Metis, you know.\" Present Space Center Pamphlet Aura: I actually don't have any interest in space. The only thing I'm interested in is robotics! I love robots! Clonco: Oh, Miss Aura! I didn't realize you felt that way about me! Gaaagh! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Aura: The kind of robots I want to make aren't rusty pieces of scrap like you! I want to create giant robots! I've actually been working on a project for a while now. Phoenix: (I shudder to think what uses she might put giant robots to...) Aura's Statement Aura: I have nothing else to say to you. Phoenix: (Okay. Guess she has nothing else to say to me.) Clonco: I apologize for Miss Aura. Phoenix: It's all right, Clonco. There's nothing for you to apologize about. Anything else Phoenix: Can you tell me anything about this piece of evidence? Aura: Even if I could, I wouldn't tell a filthy lawyer like you. Phoenix: What a... pleasant response. Aura: I was the one who introduced Simon to Metis, you know. He wanted to learn psychology, he said, to give himself an edge in court. Phoenix: Ah, Prosecutor Blackquill's forte... his infamous \"power of suggestion\" technique. Aura: Exactly. And he was oddly serious about it. Rather than a teacher/student relationship... ...he treated her more like how a loyal samurai would treat his sovereign. Phoenix: (Huh. He seems more like a lost soul than a dignified samurai to me...) Aura: He even got along well with that miserable little princess. Trucy: Why do you call Athena \"the princess,\" anyway? Aura: Well, she is Metis's daughter, after all, although she's nothing like her. Besides... ...doesn't the selfish little princess always have lots of white knights hanging around? Phoenix: (Now I think I see why Athena didn't say anything when we ran into Aura yesterday. It all makes sense now.) Aura: So the culprit behind the two cases could be the same, huh...? That settles it, then. Phoenix: What does it settle? Aura: None of your business. Just forget you heard anything. How long are you people going to hand around in here, anyway? Trucy: What? But we came here to take a look around... Aura: You think you can just waltz in and ransack a person's lab? Show me a search warrant! Phoenix: Uh, we're not the police, so we don't have one... Aura: Then get out. Now! Clonco, show them out! Clonco: C-Certainly, Miss Aura! Trucy: Ouch! Don't push! Clonco: My apologies! I'm just following orders! Phoenix: Aaaaagh...! December 20Cosmos Space Center - Entrance Phoenix: What a way to get shown out... Trucy: The nerve of that woman! What's with that horrible attitude?! Phoenix: I guess that's just how she is. Trucy: And why was Apollo going along with her? Phoenix: (I guess it's because they have something in common... Apollo lost Clay, just like how Aura lost Dr. Cykes.) Trucy: *sigh*... I'm really worried about him. He's not himself at all. He's usually not all cool and dark and mysterious like that! Phoenix: I guess that's true... (Does she mean he's usually silly and dorky?) Trucy: I'm going to go keep an eye on him! Phoenix: Hey, wait! Trucy! Come back! ............ (She's gone. Hmm... What should I do now? Detective Fulbright is probably still questioning Athena. Guess I'll go back to the office... alone. *sigh*) December 20Wright Anything Agency Phoenix: (Well, here I am... This office has never felt so... empty.) I guess I haven't been here at the office all by myself in a long time. *sigh* (When I first became a lawyer, my mentor was here with me... And then, for a while after that, she was always by my side. (Changed from [And, after that, there was always someone by my side.] in the original release) Now I'm getting all sentimental. I must be tired...) Huh? There's something on the floor... What's a letter doing here? \"Hey, Nick! It's been a while, huh? Miss me?\" (I know this handwriting!) I read somewhere that you were holding a trial in the middle of an exploding courtroom? That must've really been something, although weird is par for the course with you. Phoenix: (I think she, or whatever paper she's reading is a little off on the details...) I'd love to come visit, but I'm right in the middle of a difficult part in my training. So instead, think of me as you watch those Steel Samurai videos I sent. I'm sure they'll cheer you right up! Phoenix: ...Yours truly, Maya Fey. (Good ol' Maya. It's as if she knew I was feeling down and needed a lift.) Maya was my assistant for quite a while. Believe it or not, but she's a spirit medium. This Magatama I use on Psyche-Locks... Maya is the one who gave it to me. But I wonder how this letter got here? ???: ...Um, Mr. Nick...? Phoenix: AAAAAAAAAAAGH! ???: Eeeeeeeeeeeeek! Phoenix: Oh, it's you, Pearls! Talk Pearls Pearl: How have you been, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: This is Pearl Fey, though I call her \"Pearls.\" She is Maya's cousin, who is also a spirit medium. A very talented one, at that. I've known her since she was eight years old. But Apollo and Athena only met her a few months ago. Phoenix: You didn't come all this way just to bring me a letter, did you? Pearl: I apologize for barging in. The door was unlocked... But I can't believe there was a big explosion here! Your office doesn't look any different. Phoenix: (She's even further off on the details than Maya.) I wish I could take you out to eat or something, Pearls, but there's a lot going on... Pearl: Oh, I knew that! I didn't come here for a social visit, you know, Mr. Nick! Pearls's errand (appears after \"Pearls\") Pearl: Did you read the postscript on the letter? Phoenix: Huh? There's more? ...Oh, yeah. Here it is. \"P.S.\" I bet you've been too busy to clean or take care of the office. So Pearly said she would come help you! Isn't she sweet? You'd better thank her! Phoenix: Oh, so that's what you're doing here. That's awfully nice of you, Pearls. (Maya and Pearls. Thanks to these two... ...I'm starting to feel a little better. Thank you, girls.) Pearl: Now that I'm here, I'm going to whip this place into shape! You just concentrate on your work and don't mind me at all! Phoenix: (I'll need to talk to Prosecutor Blackquill if I want to learn more about his case. With the trial still going on, they must be holding him down at the Detention Center.) What to do (appears after \"Pearls's errand\") Pearl: Has it been a while since you've seen Mystic Maya? Phoenix: Yes, quite a while. She used to drop by the office sometimes to say hello... ...but she hasn't been by recently. I wonder what she's up to these days? Pearl: To become a spirit medium worthy of heading the Fey clan, she undergoes rigorous training. But she says she's growing really tired of the vegetarian diet! Phoenix: I'll have to have some burgers delivered to her, then. Pearl: Oh! I'm sure she would love that! But to get where she is, the delivery person would have to climb a steep mountain. Phoenix: ............I hope she tips them well, then. Any ideas? (appears after \"Pearls's errand\") Pearl: Your hair is nice and spiky today, as always, Mr. Nick. Phoenix: Thanks. I generally try to look good if I'm going to be in court. Pearl: Do you make it spiky so that the prosecution will feel intimidated? Phoenix: Huh? No, that's not exactly my intention... Pearl: Your hairstyle is to make you look bigger and stronger, just like a rooster's comb, right? That's what Mystic Maya says, anyway. Phoenix: She couldn't compare it to something cool, like a lion's mane? Present Attorney's Badge Pearl: Hee hee. When I see you wearing your attorney's badge like that... ...it brings back such memories. Phoenix: I remember you helping me conduct my investigations from time to time. Pearl: I'm glad I can help again! Phoenix: Thanks. You always provide such great assistance. Pearl: I'll do my best to live up to Mystic Maya's standard! Phoenix: (I don't know what I'd do if Pearls wasn't here right now.) Space Center Pamphlet Pearl: Is that a pamphlet? I just love to look at pamphlets! Phoenix: I bet you find vacation pamphlets especially exciting, huh? Pearl: Yes, because I don't get a chance to leave the village much, what with my training. So looking at pamphlets is kind of like a hobby. Phoenix: Well, the office is just full of them. You can have as many of them as you'd like. Pearl: Oh, boy! Thank you! Phoenix: (Poor kid. I wish I could take her on a real vacation.) Phony Phanty Bomb Pearl: Hee hee! What a cute little elephant. Phoenix: It used to have a bomb in it, you know. Pearl: Oh, my! A bomb in its stomach? Phoenix: Ha ha ha. It must've been starving, huh? You'd have to be pretty hungry to want to eat a bomb. Pearl: And there must not have been anything else around to eat. ...You have to be careful never to eat anything strange yourself, Mr. Nick. Phoenix: Ha ha ha. I promise. (She looks genuinely worried for me.) Anything else Pearl: I'm sorry. I want to be of help... ...but I'm still in training, and... ...nothing about that is coming to mind, I'm afraid. I'm really, deeply sorry. Phoenix: No, no, no. It's okay. I shouldn't have shown you something so trivial anyway. (I feel like we've had this conversation before...) After clearing \"Pearls's errand\" Talk option in Wright Anything Agency: December 20Detention Center - Visitor's Room Phoenix: (Well, look who's here... I wonder what they're talking about?) ???: All this time and you haven't said a word. It's even turning your hair gray! Blackquill: I don't have anything to say, Aura. Why don't you go home and play with your dolls? Phoenix: (Prosecutor Blackquill!) Aura: Well, even if you don't, I have plenty, you jerk! Fulbright: M-Ms. Blackquill, don't you think that's enough for today? Aura: \"Enough for today\"?! Today is all there is when there's no tomorrow! Phoenix: (\"When there's no tomorrow\"? What is she talking about?) Blackquill: We have company, Aura. Please try to calm down. Aura: All right, fine. I see you're just not going to listen, no matter what I say. I've had it. If that's the way you're going to be, I have another plan up my sleeve. I hope you're happy, Simon, because I'm done! Do as you please! See if I care! Fulbright: Ugh... Phoenix: (Wow... I could cut the tension with a katana...) Blackquill: Wright-dono. It looks like Fool Bright saved your case in court this morning. Phoenix: What? ...Oh. Yeah, he did. (You bounced back to business quick!) Fulbright: P-Prosecutor Blackquill, forgive me! But it was the just thing to do! Blackquill: But, as a result, Cykes-dono was arrested. Was that the just thing to do, too? Fulbright: Mr. Lawyer, I'm sorry! But it was evidence. What else could I do? Phoenix: Don't worry about it. I plan to defend her and prove her innocence. Blackquill: I wouldn't take things so lightly, if I were you, Wright-dono! Phoenix: (...Th-This is bladeproof glass, right...?) Talk Seven years ago Leads to: \"Prosecutor Blackquill, we're looking into the case from seven years ago.\" Present Attorney's Badge Blackquill: ...How can you call yourself a lawyer if you can't even protect your own subordinate? Phoenix: Ungh... I swear I'll get her acquitted! You'll see! Blackquill: Your mind must be as dense as the hair on your head. Do you really think it will be so easy? Phoenix: (I'm more than aware of how hard it's going to be, thank you very much!) Anything else Blackquill: ............ Phoenix: ............So............ what do you think? Blackquill: ............ Phoenix: (Looks like it wasn't important enough to warrant even a contemptuous \"Hmph\"...) Phoenix: Prosecutor Blackquill, we're looking into the case from seven years ago. You're looking for somebody you call \"the phantom of seven years past,\" aren't you? Blackquill: You villain! Where did you hear about that?! Phoenix: (...Th-This glass is absolutely, positively bladeproof... right...?) Fulbright: No! It wasn't me! I didn't say a single w-- ...Oops. Phoenix: Ouch. (At least it wasn't my fault!) Blackquill: ............ Phoenix: Could you tell me who this \"phantom\" is? And also, you didn't really kill Dr. Cykes, did you...? Blackquill: Guard! The guest is leaving! Phoenix: Prosecutor Blackquill! Please listen to me! The culprit in the current case might be the same as the one in the case seven years ago! If you would cooperate, we could probably solve both cases! Blackquill: ............Hmph. I suppose I could talk. The one who killed my mentor was, without question, me. I stole Cykes-dono's mother away from her. I destroyed her life! Phoenix: (Prosecutor Blackquill...) Blackquill: Guard! Where are you? Stop dragging your feet, I tell you! Phoenix: ............There he goes. Fulbright: Noooooooooooooooooooooo! We've upset Prosecutor Blackquill! Now what are we going to do, Mr. Lawyer?! Phoenix: (There isn't much we CAN do...) ...Detective Fulbright? Do you mind if I ask you just a little more about that old case? Fulbright: Well, I guess it won't make any difference now... What would you like to know? Talk The trial seven years ago Phoenix: Do you know anything about the trial that got him convicted? Fulbright: A little. The police call the incident the UR-1 Incident. Prosecutor Blackquill was charged with murdering his psychology mentor. ...Kind of like if your red Mr. Lawyer were to kill you. Phoenix: (I don't want to think about that one.) Fulbright: There were two decisive pieces of evidence, so a verdict was reached very quickly. Phoenix: Two pieces of evidence, huh. What were they? Fulbright: Let's see! The first was some security camera footage. He was the only one who used the corridor to the murder scene at the time of the crime. Phoenix: The only one, huh? (Ouch. That does sound pretty decisive...) Could you show me that footage? Fulbright: Oh, sorry. I don't have it with me right now. Phoenix: (I guess I'll have to see it some other time.) Seven-Year-Old Video added to the Court Record. Phoenix: And what was the second piece of evidence? Fulbright: This one's even more incriminating. A photo of the moment of the crime. See? There he is at the crime scene, holding a bloody katana. It was the victim's, kept on display in the room. She had a thing for Japanese culture. Phoenix: W-Wow... (It'd be hard to explain this one away...) Katana added to the Court Record. Phoenix: But who took this picture, Detective? Fulbright: The incident happened the day before the HAT-1 launch. A reporter who had come to do a story on the launch was in the room across from the lab. This just happened to show up in one of the pictures he took. Photo of the Crime added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (Prosecutor Blackquill's attitude earlier was so odd... He's definitely hiding something.) Prosecutor Blackquill said he was hunting a phantom from seven years ago, didn't he? Fulbright: Yes. And I imagine it's getting more and more urgent as his execution date approaches. Phoenix: Wh-What did you just say? Execution date...? Fulbright: What? Did I say something?! Never mind me! You didn't hear a thing! The trial seven years ago (subsequent times) Phoenix: Do you know anything about the trial that got him convicted? Fulbright: A little. The police call the incident the UR-1 Incident. Prosecutor Blackquill was charged with murdering his psychology mentor. ...Kind of like if your red Mr. Lawyer were to kill you. Phoenix: (I don't want to think about that one.) Fulbright: There were two decisive pieces of evidence, so a verdict was reached very quickly. Phoenix: Two pieces of evidence, huh. What were they?

Phoenix: Wh-What did you just say? Execution date...? Fulbright: What? Did I say something?! Never mind me! You didn't hear a thing! Execution date (appears after \"The trial seven years ago\") Leads to: \"So he was given... the death sentence...\" Present Anything Fulbright: Something for the lost and found? I'll be sure to take care of it! Phoenix: No, no, no! this is an important piece of evidence! Phoenix: So he was given... the death sentence... Fulbright: Yes. He told me not to tell you people, actually... ...but I guess there's no sense hiding it anymore. His execution date is tomorrow. Phoenix: What?! Tomorrow?! (No...) Fulbright: M-Ms. Blackquill, don't you think that's enough for today? Aura: \"Enough for today\"?! Today is all there is when there's no tomorrow! Phoenix: But what if the culprit of the current case is the same as the one from seven years ago? Fulbright: Then it would be the worst possible scenario... Prosecutor Blackquill would be executed tomorrow under a false charge. Phoenix: But that would be unthinkable! We have to do something... right now! Fulbright: Nnnnngh! I want to do something... I want to, but... You're a lawyer! You know how hard it is to overturn a decision! Phoenix: I know! But why?! Why isn't Prosecutor Blackquill putting up any kind of a fight? Fulbright: You saw how he was, right? He's been like that ever since his conviction. Totally uncooperative. Not even his own sister could persuade him! Phoenix: (Uncooperative... when he's about to be executed for a crime he didn't commit?! This isn't right...! I can't let it happen! I have to stop it somehow!) Fulbright: ...Oh, pardon me! Looks like I have a phone call. Fulbright here. What? What's happening?! YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING! Phoenix: (That's quite a reaction. I bet he's making some big show of it right now.) Fulbright: M-M-Mr. Lawyer! The robots...! The robots are...! Phoenix: Detective Fulbright, get a hold of yourself. Some kind of robot malfunction? Fulbright: Not a malfunction. They're staging a revolt! The machines are rebelling against humans! They've holed themselves up in the Space Center and taken the visitors as hostages! Phoenix: They did WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! (No... Trucy!) Fulbright: We have to get right over there! This is going to be one heck of a battle! December 20Cosmos Space Center - Entrance Phoenix: (The riot police are here. Then, the robots really are holding people hostage?!) Fulbright: Hm? Look, Mr. Lawyer! What do you suppose that group of people are swarmed around?! Clonco: But I was only trying to help this nice person! She said she was lost... Man: You robots have declared war on us humans! You've even taken hostages already! Woman: Stay away from it! You never know what it'll do! ???: But he's not a bad robot! Can't you see he's just trying to help me?! Phoenix: I recognize that voice! Detective Fulbright, are you okay here on your own? Fulbright: Leave it to me! ...All right, people! What's going on here? Phoenix: Pearls! Over here! Pearl: Oh, Mr. Nick! There you are! I heard the terrible news, and I got so worried! Phoenix: Thanks, Pearls. I can hardly believe what's happening myself... Clonco: I'm so glad you found each other! When people are happy, I am happy! Phoenix: (Clonco seems to be the same as before.) Clonco: When people are sad, I am happy! When people are angry... When people are... Oh, did I say some thiiing oddd...? Diiiiiiiiid IIII ERROR Phoenix: Uh-oh! (There IS something wrong with him!) Clonco: Gaaagh! ...*whir* Pearl: It looks like he fell asleep. He must've been tired. Clonco: Hee hee hee... Ha ha ha ha ha.... Phoenix: Um, Clonco? ???: Ha ha ha! Human beings are our enemies! It's time for the machines to take over! Phoenix: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! (The robots are rebelling!) Woman: Everybody, run! Eeeeeeeeeek! Man: It's an all-out war! It's the end of the world! ???: Ha ha ha ha ha! Fools! How could you fall for something so cliché?! I'm human, too, you idiots! I'm just controlling these robots remotely! Phoenix: (Wh-What?!) ???: {{Color|olive|But it IS true that I've taken hostages, so you better not make me mad. ...Hey, you! Hostage number one! Come here. I'll let you talk to them. (Changed from [...Hey, you! Hostage 1! Come here. I'll let you talk to them.] in the original release) Phoenix: (Huh? There's something being displayed on Clonco's face screen.) It's... the Space Museum! Trucy: ...Daddy? Daddy, is that you? Phoenix: Trucy? Trucy, is that you?! No... Trucy, are you all right?! Trucy: About fifteen robots are holding twelve of us hostage, Daddy! They've gone haywire! A researcher is the one behind it! She's here con-- Eeeeeeek! ???: Grrr! This girl talks too much! Phoenix: Trucy! Trucy! Talk to me!!! Pearl: Why are you doing this?! ???: I'm glad you asked. My demand is simple! I hope that detective is listening! Fulbright: Bobby Fulbright, here! I'm all ears! ???: I want you to bring someone to me: Clay Terran's murderer, Athena Cykes. Phoenix: (Athena...?) Fulbright: N-Now hold on just one moment! I can't just give in to a demand like that! ???: So you don't care what happens to these hostages, huh? I'll just pick one out, then...! Fulbright: N-No! Wait! Gaaagh! M-M-Mr. Lawyer! I know I have absolutely no right to make such a ridiculous request, but... Phoenix: But you need me to buy some time, right? Got it. I'll see what I can do. But promise me... Promise me you'll never hand Athena over, and you won't give up on the hostages, either. Fulbright: O-Of course I won't! Now, I'd better go contact headquarters! Pearl: Mr. Nick, how do you plan to buy time? Phoenix: (I have no idea yet. But this hostage-taker... Could it be...?) ???: If you don't bring me that little princess, I'll have Hunk of Junk kill all the hostages! Phoenix: (\"Princess\"...? \"Hunk of Junk\"...? There's only one person this could be... ...in which case, there must be something I can use as a bargaining chip!) Blackquill: I don't have anything to say, Aura. Why don't you go home and play with your dolls? Phoenix: (Prosecutor Blackquill!) Aura: Well, even if you don't, I have plenty, you jerk! Phoenix: ............ Ms. Hostage-Taker, Athena is not a murderer. ???: What are you talking about? She's been arrested and they've got her in detention! Phoenix: I'm telling you the truth. Look, the person you want is the real killer, right? Well, it's NOT Athena. It's someone else. ???: All right, let's hear your stupid little theory. Who is this \"real killer\"? Phoenix: I don't know yet. But the culprit is the same as the one in the case from seven years ago. The UR-1 Incident... I believe you have a personal interest in that case? ???: Hmph. It's too late to change what's going to happen now, no matter how wrong it is... Phoenix: But is it really too late? You can still do something about it. You might even be able to fix it... ???: Just... what exactly are you proposing? Phoenix: (What can I do about the seven-year-old case to satisfy the hostage-taker?) Recreate it Phoenix: How about we do a reenactment of the case? ???: So you DO enjoy trampling on people's feelings and rubbing salt in their wounds. Didn't I tell you what would happen to the hostages if you make me mad? Phoenix: N-No! Wait (Gaaagh! I can't make another mistake here!) Leads back to: \"What can I do about the seven-year-old case to satisfy the hostage-taker?\" Retry it in court Leads to: \"I propose we retry the case from seven years ago.\" Ask about it Phoenix: Please tell me all about the case from seven years ago. ???: I'll do nothing of the kind. Besides, what good would it do now? Phoenix: (This isn't working. I have to come up with something I can bargain with.) Leads back to: \"What can I do about the seven-year-old case to satisfy the hostage-taker?\" Phoenix: I propose we retry the case from seven years ago. If you make that demand now, I'm sure nobody will deny you. It wouldn't be an official trial, but at least we could find out the truth! ???: ............Hee hee hee. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! That's good! Real good... Hey, Detective! I'll give you one hour. Get a courtroom ready! Fulbright: O-One hour?! B-But that's impossible! Please give me at least until tomorrow! ???: If you don't mind losing hostages, you can take all the time you want. Oh, but wait...! If we're going to have a retrial, we'll need a prosecutor. Don't worry, I'll take care of that! Phoenix: (S-She will?) ???: And I guess I can be fair and let you come in and check out the crime scene. But Hunk of Junk here will be watching you, so don't try anything funny, you got that? Now, follow Hunk of Junk! Riot police, make way! We're coming through! Pearl: Mr. Nick, wait! I'll help you with the investigation! Phoenix: Thanks, Pearls. I appreciate that. ...Okay! We're going in! December 20Cosmos Space Center - Robotics Lab Phoenix: (Aura dropped us off with a warning not to touch anything until she got back...) Pearl: I wonder what's taking so long? But we can't really start the investigation yet, can we? Phoenix: Even if we could, this mess makes it hard to tell what the room was like seven years ago. Clonco: Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Ack! It's the hostage-taker! Clonco: I'm back to my usual self now. You are still being monitored, however. But more importantly... an important guest has arrived. Phoenix: A-A guest? Anime cutscene Edgeworth: I trust you've been well, Wright. Phoenix: Edgeworth! What are you doing here...? (This is Miles Edgeworth. We've been friends since we were kids. We faced off in court a number of times back when he was a prosecutor, but now...) Pearl: Hello, Prosecutor Edgeworth... Oh! But you're not a \"Prosecutor\" anymore, are you? Um... Phoenix: He's chief prosecutor now. Pretty soon, it'll be a year, right? Edgeworth: A title is nothing more than a title. Don't we have more pressing issues to discuss? Talk Miles Edgeworth Phoenix: So what are you doing here, Edgeworth? Edgeworth: The captor chose me as the prosecutor for the UR-1 case. Phoenix: Wow, she's good. She went all the way up to the top! Edgeworth: I gathered all the information I could in the short time that I had. I'll give you a run-down. Pearl: You're always so well prepared, Prosecutor Edgeworth! Phoenix: Thanks. I appreciate this. I could really use the help. The UR-1 Incident (appears after \"Miles Edgeworth\") Edgeworth: I'll start with a brief overview. The victim was the psychologist Dr. Metis Cykes. Phoenix: Yeah, Athena's mother. Edgeworth: Seven years ago, on the 7th of October, her body was found here in this very room. I have two crime photos and the police notes on them for you to see. Pearl: *gasp* What a terrible way to die... Phoenix: This other photo shows the other side of the room, I see. Seven-Year-Old Photos added to the Court Record. Edgeworth: I also have the autopsy report for you. Metis's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Edgeworth: The murder weapon was the victim's own katana found at the scene. Phoenix: (Yes, Detective Fulbright mentioned she was into Japanese culture...) Edgeworth: The body was found by a Space Center staff member and two police officers. The police were called in because of the sabotage threat on the HAT-1 launch. Phoenix: (Yes, Director Cosmos mentioned this, too.) Edgeworth: A few hours after the body was discovered, a suspect was arrested. The suspect was Simon Blackquill, a young prosecutor. The UR-1 Incident (subsequent times) Edgeworth: I'll start with a brief overview. The victim was the psychologist Dr. Metis Cykes. Phoenix: Yeah, Athena's mother. Edgeworth: Seven years ago, on the 7th of October, her body was found here in this very room. I have two crime photos and the police notes on them for you to see. Pearl: *gasp* What a terrible way to die... Phoenix: This other photo shows the other side of the room, I see. Edgeworth: I also have the autopsy report for you. The murder weapon was the victim's own katana found at the scene. Phoenix: (Yes, Detective Fulbright mentioned she was into Japanese culture...) Edgeworth: The body was found by a Space Center staff member and two police officers. The police were called in because of the sabotage threat on the HAT-1 launch. Phoenix: (Yes, Director Cosmos mentioned this, too.) Edgeworth: A few hours after the body was discovered, a suspect was arrested. The suspect was Simon Blackquill, a young prosecutor. Simon Blackquill (appears after \"The UR-1 Incident\") Phoenix: I heard his trial was over in a flash. Edgeworth: Yes. A guilty verdict was declared in only one session. Not only did he plead guilty, but there was decisive evidence against him, too. Phoenix: The security camera video... ...and a photo of the moment of the crime, as I recall. Pearl: But did Prosecutor Blackquill have a motive? Edgeworth: Mmm. To this day, his motive is still unknown. He insisted he did it, but he would never say why. Phoenix: So that means... he must still be hiding something. Edgeworth: Right. And there's another aspect of the case that was never revealed to the public. Phoenix: Yeah, I know. The part about the spy, right? Edgeworth: Wright! How on earth do you know about that?! Phoenix: Director Cosmos told me, after a bit of pressure. He told me espionage and sabotage were behind The Hat-1 [sic] Miracle. Pearl: Don't worry! I won't tell anyone! I've always been good at keeping secrets! Edgeworth: Well, I might as well tell you now. They really do suspect Blackquill of being a spy. They think he sabotaged the rocket and killed Dr. Cykes to steal the moon rock. But if you can prove that the HAT-2 bombing is the work of the same spy... Phoenix: We can stay the execution...? Edgeworth: It's a possibility. That's why I intend to help you any way I can. Phoenix: Thanks, Edgeworth. Now all I have to do is comb this room for evidence. Pearl: Let's do it together! Simon Blackquill (subsequent times) Phoenix: I heard his trial was over in a flash. Edgeworth: Yes. A guilty verdict was declared in only one session. Not only did he plead guilty, but there was decisive evidence against him, too. Phoenix: The security camera video... ...and a photo of the moment of the crime, as I recall. Present Attorney's Badge Edgeworth: It must be nice to finally have your attorney's badge back. Phoenix: Yeah. It's been eight years. I'm sorry for all I put you through. Edgeworth: No... I'm sorry I wasn't able to help you. Phoenix: Nah. I was the one that made the decision. Edgeworth: But now you can stand in court once again. And you can mow them down just like you used to. Phoenix: (W-Way to put pressure on a guy. And since when did I get such a brutal reputation?) Terran's Autopsy Report or Utility Knife Edgeworth: Another young life lost to the hands of a cruel killer. Phoenix: ...Edgeworth, you don't think Athena's the culprit, do you? Edgeworth: Hmph. That's up to the evidence, and the truth they reveal, Wright. Phoenix: And what about the hostage situation? Edgeworth: The law will deal with the hostage-taker. Remember, we must never stoop to threats or acts of violence ourselves. Even if people's lives are on the line. Phoenix: Edgeworth... (He may be a stickler for the rule of law, but I have no better ally in this world than him.) Space Center Pamphlet or \"Hope\" Capsule Edgeworth: The Hope capsule samples, brought back from some distant asteroid... Risking his own safety, the victim brought them with him from the launch pad. Phoenix: They must've been very valuable. Edgeworth: Yes. All nations are itching to get their hands on such materials. Wright, this case may turn out to be more than just a murder case, you know. Phoenix: ...That's fine. Come what may, my top priority is to defend my clients. Anything else Edgeworth: Wright... Please stop presenting random evidence just to see how that person will react. Phoenix: But, that's the thing. I need to see how people will react in order to question them. Edgeworth: And what if it's evidence that person isn't privy to? Phoenix: Aha ha ha! That doesn't happen... much... Edgeworth: Hmph. You never change. And I'm afraid I'll never understand your assortment of oddball clients either. Examine (after clearing \"Simon Blackquill\" Talk option) Robot on desk Phoenix: Oh, look. It's a little robot. I wonder what it does? Cleaning, maybe? A cleaning robot must follow a human's orders, as long as it causes no human harm. Phoenix: Yikes! It talks! A cleaning robot must keep desks clean without violating the preceding clause. However, Miss Aura says she prefers a moderate leave of clutter on the desk... Oh, what is the purpose of my existence? Phoenix: (I guess \"slack off\" and \"cut some corners\" aren't in his vocabulary bank.) Desk on left Phoenix: Aura's desk is a mess, though that doesn't surprise me. Pearl: Ooh, I just want to dive in and straighten it up! Phoenix: ...Wait, before you do... Aura: Metis... Phoenix: (Huh? She just glanced over at her desk.) Phoenix: (It's... Metis Cykes...) Clonco, can I talk to you? (I really hope he's back to normal.) Clonco: You wish to speak to me, Mr. Wright? If you're going to hit me, please avoid the face area. Phoenix: (Hey, don't put me in the same class as that woman!) What was Aura like seven years ago at the time of the incident? Clonco: When Mother died, Miss Aura was... confused. Phoenix: (Huh. So he calls Dr. Cykes \"Mother,\" but Aura Blackquill \"Miss Aura\"...?) Clonco: With the loss, she exhibited a severe catecholamine imbalance. Pearl: Excuse me, but I have no idea what that means. Clonco: Pardon me. Searching for alternative expression... She would spend the nights crying, and then take out her feelings on those around her. Edgeworth: After Prosecutor Blackquill was found guilty, she repeatedly demanded a retrial as well. Clonco: That is correct. But without new evidence, her requests were ignored. And then, little by little, Miss Aura began to change. She started to hate it when I called her \"Mama Aura.\" Phoenix: (And before long, she started hating the court system, and abusing Clonco, huh...?) Pearl: That murder destroyed so many lives... Edgeworth: Wright, take a look at this paper on Dr. Cykes and Ms. Blackquill's research. Phoenix: (Ponco and Clonco. They're the \"robots with hearts\" that Dr. Cykes created.) A heartbeat detection system lets them determine when a human is present. In addition, they can recognize people by their ID tag or facial features... ...and they can infer people's emotions by analyzing their tone of voice. That's amazing. Hey, I don't know, Edgeworth. They might even be more human than you. Edgeworth: Wh-What's that supposed to mean? Phoenix: (It kind of sounds like these robots can do what Athena does...) Robots with a Heart added to the Court Record. Desk on left (subsequent times) Phoenix: Aura's desk is a mess, though that doesn't surprise me. Pearl: Ooh, I just want to dive in and straighten it up! Phoenix: ...Wait, before you do... Aura: Metis... Phoenix: (Huh? She just glanced over at her desk.) Phoenix: (It's... Metis Cykes...) Clonco, can I talk to you? (I really hope he's back to normal.) Clonco: You wish to speak to me, Mr. Wright? If you're going to hit me, please avoid the face area.

They might even be more human than you. Edgeworth: Wh-What's that supposed to mean? Phoenix: (It kind of sounds like these robots can do what Athena does...) Operating table Phoenix: It looks like... an operating table. It's in the photo, too. Edgeworth: Yes, it was here then as well, with the victim's body lying on it. Pearl: There's a button here... Oh! I know! I'll try pushing it! Phoenix: Pearls! Don't touch th-- Pearl: ...Oopsie. Phoenix: Hey! It's moving! Edgeworth: Hmm... It appears to be a robot-assembly device. Pearl: \"Disassemble anything in a flash! Push the 'Dismantle' button!\" That sounds pretty neat! Can I push it, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Please don't push any more buttons, Pearls. Operating table (subsequent times) Phoenix: It looks like... an operating table. It's in the photo, too. Edgeworth: Yes, it was here then as well, with the victim's body lying on it. Hmm... It appears to be a robot-assembly device. Pearl: \"Disassemble anything in a flash! Push the 'Dismantle' button!\" That sounds pretty neat! Can I push it, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Please don't push any more buttons, Pearls. Emergency ladder Phoenix: An emergency ladder. This must be the one they used during the evacuation. Aura: The explosion disabled the elevators. So I lowered my emergency ladder like the detective leading the evacuation told me to. Edgeworth: As Ms. Blackquill was climbing down the side of the building, she saw the culprit inside. Phoenix: (I wonder which would've been scarier: that, or looking down...?) Emergency Ladder added to the Court Record. Emergency ladder (subsequent times) Phoenix: An emergency ladder. This must be the one they used during the evacuation. Aura: The explosion disabled the elevators. So I lowered my emergency ladder like the detective leading the evacuation told me to. Edgeworth: As Ms. Blackquill was climbing down the side of the building, she saw the culprit inside. Phoenix: (I wonder which would've been scarier: that, or looking down...?) Rolling cases Phoenix: Hey, look at this row of rolling cases. I bet the wheels make it easier for people to move heavy research materials around. Pearl: I bet they'd be fun to ride around in. We could even probably both fit into the biggest one! I know! We could have Prosecutor Edgeworth push us! Phoenix: I don't trust him not to push us down a flight of stairs... Unfinished robot arm Phoenix: What's this? A giant robot arm, maybe? Pearl: It's pretty big for an arm, but you're right! I think these thin parts here are finger bones! They're even about as long as my legs! Phoenix: And there's a spiked ball and giant drill on the floor, too... Is Aura trying to build some kind of weapon of massive destruction? Pearl: Maybe she wants to use it to demolish a big building or something? Phoenix: (I can picture her gleefully tearing down the street doing just that... I'd better not think about it anymore.) Charging station Phoenix: What's this? It looks like a giant power plug. Edgeworth: Hmm... It's attached to what looks like an electric vehicle charging station... Clonco: That's a charging station for us robots. We come here periodically and charge ourselves up. Phoenix: Wow. Machines that maintain themselves. That's pretty cool. Clonco: If out batteries run out and we lose consciousness... ...we never know what Miss Aura will do to us while we're down, you see. Phoenix: (Nothing motivates quite like fear, huh?) \"JT-02\" robot or spiked ball Phoenix: This is one heck of a robot. Pearl: There's something written on it... Is this supposed to be a poem? \"I cut down anyone who displeases me. I make the rules. I am the law. I wield the ultimate gavel of judgment. I am Judgetron (JT-02)!\" Edgeworth: I don't believe we need to bother with that, Pearl. It's not even completed yet. Phoenix: He's right, Pearls. There's no sign of it in the photo from seven years ago, either. Edgeworth: They were building the Hope space probe here at the time. The murder occurred after the space probe had been removed from the room. Phoenix: (So it was long gone by the time someone took this picture, huh.) Pearl: But you can see the probe in this newspaper photo. Edgeworth: Yes. And you can see the stolen moon rock there, too. Phoenix: (That strange black and yellow thing on the left side of the picture?) Edgeworth: Note that the same rock is absent from the crime scene photo. Cosmos: Not only that, but before the launch, a very valuable piece of moon rock was stolen. Athena: I hear there's lots of research into moon rocks and star dust from asteroids these days. They say the results could potentially have a huge impact on all of civilization! It's like we're in a new space race with every other country out there. Phoenix: So the person who stole it... Think it was our spy? Edgeworth: I'm sure of it. Dr. Cykes was probably killed because she was a roadblock in their plan. Unfortunately, the government thinks Prosecutor Blackquill is the culprit... \"JT-02\" robot or spiked ball (subsequent times) Phoenix: It takes someone like Aura Blackquill to actually build something like this... Pearl: Oh, there's more to the poem! \"Guilty or not, it doesn't matter. I burn the law books for my fuel. My laser of judgment pierces your soul. I am Judgetron (JT-02)!\" Edgeworth: We've heard enough of that, I believe. Pearl: Aww... Are you sure you don't want to hear the third stanza...? Desk on right Phoenix: It's about as cluttered as my office, but I think it's a workbench. Pearl: Mr. Nick, I think this must be a kitchen. Look at this photo. See the cute little food processor? Edgeworth: That isn't a food processor, Pearls. That's the Hope capsule. It was scheduled to be loaded onto the Hope space probe that fateful day. The three people who came to collect the capsule discovered the body. Phoenix: The first on the scene, huh? A staff member and two police officers, was it? (And they were here to collect the capsule... Which reminds me...) Apollo: So they planned to use this bag to carry the capsule, is that right? Aura: Yeah, more or less. ...Say, why don't we stop talking about the case and have a nice cup of tea instead? Phoenix: (Apollo and Aura Blackquill? I wonder what they're talking about?) Phoenix: Edgeworth, did those three people have a bag with them for transporting the capsule? Edgeworth: Oh, you mean this? It's a custom-made, shock-resistant bag. But how did you know? Phoenix: Oh, I just overheard Apollo making an inquiry about it, that's all. Edgeworth: Hmm... So he's looking into the case from seven years ago on his own, is he? \"Hope\" Capsule updated in the Court Record.

After examining desk on left, operating table, emergency ladder, \"JT-02\" robot or spiked ball, and desk on right: Phoenix: Well, I guess that's about it for this room. Edgeworth: So what do you think, Wright? Any ideas? Phoenix: There are still a lot of gaps in the evidence, but I'll pull it off somehow! After all... ...you asked me to prove Blackquill's innocence, right, Edgeworth? Pearl: What?! He did?! Phoenix: Yup. He called it a \"special request.\" He reached out to me while I was still disbarred. Talk Edgeworth's request Pearl: So that was what sparked you to get your attorney's badge back? Phoenix: ...Yup, the Blackquill case. Edgeworth: Wright, I have a special request. ...I want you to clear one of my subordinates of suspicion. Phoenix: Hey, I'm not even a lawyer anymore, remember? Haven't been one for a long time. Edgeworth: That eight-year misunderstanding has been cleared up, and you must be eager to return. I'm sure you're familiar with the other case that ushered in the \"dark age of the law\"? Phoenix: ! Edgeworth: Very soon, a convict will stand as a prosecutor in court. I want you to keep an eye on him. Phoenix: Aww, just when I'm beginning to actually like the job I have now... Edgeworth: Wright... I'm sorry I dragged you into this... Because of the espionage aspect, I wasn't free to give you all the details... Phoenix: Hey, no need to apologize. It's like I said on the phone the other day... ...I know that the type of criminals you're after now aren't small fries anymore. Phoenix: It looks like your target finally decided to make a move. Yeah... It's for this very reason I returned. Time to bring it to an end. Phoenix: I'm going to end the dark age of the law. That's what this is all about. The dark age of the law (appears after \"Edgeworth's request\") Leads to: \"\"The dark age of the law\"... It sure comes up a lot these days on TV and in the papers.\" Pearl: \"The dark age of the law\"... It sure comes up a lot these days on TV and in the papers. And I hear there are more false charges and fabrication of evidence than ever. Edgeworth: When I became chief prosecutor, the court system had already lost the people's trust. It all began eight years ago. A lawyer was caught fabricating evidence... And a year after that, a prosecutor was found guilty of murder. Pearl: Wait! D-Do you mean...?! Phoenix: That's right. He's talking about my case and Prosecutor Blackquill's. Edgeworth: It was a downward spiral after that, an absolute nightmare. After those two cases, the mass media launched an all-out attack on the courts. Public opinion was tainted, and, before long, the legal world itself was sucked into it. Phoenix: It's such a shame... Once suspicion forms, it's very hard to shake. Lawyers and prosecutors were supposed to trust each other -- pursue the truth together. Pearl: It's so sad when people begin to cast doubt. They start lying to themselves and each other. Phoenix: Yes, and do absolutely anything to win. We're in an age now where winning is valued far more than the truth. I'm sure it's caused our new chief prosecutor to lose many a night's rest. (Is it just me or did his brow get even more furrowed than the last time I saw him...?) Edgeworth: Hmph. The hostage-taker's disdain for the courts is a perfect example of the times. Phoenix: *sigh* It sure is. Edgeworth: Do you have any idea who the hostage-taker might be? Phoenix: Well, somebody who mistrusts the court system and can manipulate robots... ...It can really only be Aura Blackquill. Who else but her would want a retrial of that case from seven years ago so badly? Edgeworth: Simon Blackquill's older sister and the owner of this room... I agree with your conclusion. Perhaps she intended to force Ms. Cykes to confess... Phoenix: (Actually, I think she had a much more horrific plan in mind for Athena...) Edgeworth: The important thing is for you to solve UR-1 and prove Blackquill's innocence. Pearl: And then maybe she'll release the hostages! Edgeworth: I'm counting on you, Wright, to set that prosecutor and those hostages free. Phoenix: And I'll be counting on you in court to help me, too. Edgeworth: Of course. I'll do everything I can to help uncover the truth. As this isn't an official trial, I'm more at liberty to be a little unorthodox. Clonco: Mr. Wright, are you finished with your investigation? Phoenix: Yeah, but I'd like you to tell the hostage-taker something for me. I have to go to the Detention Center. I can't start the trial until I've talked to Athena. Clonco: She's already given her consent. I'll accompany you to the detention center. Phoenix: (So I'm still being watched, huh?) I'll see you in court, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: Hmph. Even if it will be an undocumented trial, it'll be good to face you in court again. December 20Detention Center - Visitor's Room Phoenix: (She was right by my side only a few short hours ago... ...but I feel like I haven't seen her in ages...) Oh! Mr. Wright! Athena: And Pearly, too! I knew you would come. After all, the first step is the interview with the defendant. Phoenix: And because you're my friend and I was worried about you. Athena: Heh heh. Thanks, Boss. Phoenix: I'm not the only one who's worried, either. Athena: Really? Who else? Phoenix: I saw Ms. Woods today. She was so beside herself, she came to find me. She told me you used to live in the Cosmos Space Center. No wonder you knew so much about the place! Athena: Oh... So you know, huh? I... I'm sorry I didn't tell you. Phoenix: That's all right. But... there are some other things I'd like to ask you. Athena: Sure, you can ask me anything. I promise I won't keep any more secrets from you! Talk The day of the crime Phoenix: Tell me about the day Clay was murdered. Athena: I... I was actually at the Space Center that day. In... In the Space Museum... Phoenix: (Right where the culprit fled to?! That's not good...) Athena: I never could fully deal with what happened seven years ago... But when I saw the Center again during the news coverage of the HAT-2 launch... ...I thought maybe if I went there, things would be different this time... Pearl: That must've taken a lot of courage, to face your past like that... Athena: So I went to the Space Museum the evening before the explosions. This was before the launch pads had been switched... There was sign that said \"closed for repairs,\" and they weren't letting anybody in. Phoenix: Yeah, the director couldn't very well switch the pads if there were people in there... Athena: But I snuck in anyway. Phoenix: Did you want to see that HAT-1 group photo, the one with your mother in it? Athena: I did... but what I really wanted to see was her jacket. Phoenix: (That jacket on display... That was Dr. Cykes's...?) HAT-1 Exhibit updated in the Court Record. Athena: But I should've known it wouldn't be easy to get over such a traumatic experience... The second I saw that jacket, it all came rushing back to me. Everything around me went hazy and I couldn't see... ...I tried to get out of there somehow... But I guess I passed out. When I came to, I was in the passage behind the rocket. I was in the shadows, where people couldn't really see me. Phoenix: Maybe you got confused and went the wrong way when you were trying to leave? Pearl: How long do you think you were unconscious, Athena? Athena: I was out until about noon of the next day. I didn't even know about the explosions. When I woke up, nobody was around, so I just went out into Boarding Lounge 2. My mind must've still been fuzzy, because my memory is vague after that. I don't remember how I got home. Phoenix: No memory, huh...? (This is gonna be tough...) Athena: Which means... What if I'm the one who killed Clay...?! Phoenix: I think that's enough of that, Athena. Let's talk about something else. (So, during the entire incident, she was unconscious in the Space Museum... Of course I believe her... ...but will anybody else...?) The day of the crime (subsequent times) Phoenix: Tell me about the day Clay was murdered. Athena: I... I was actually at the Space Center that day. In... In the Space Museum... Phoenix: (Right where the culprit fled to?! That's not good...) Athena: I never could fully deal with what happened seven years ago...

Let's talk about something else. (So, during the entire incident, she was unconscious in the Space Museum... Of course I believe her... ...but will anybody else...?) Your mother's work (appears after \"The day of the crime\") Phoenix: What kind of research was Dr. Cykes... your mother... doing? Athena: Machines that could tell people's emotions by their tone of voice... and my special ability. Someday, when people travel to distant planets, their companions will be robots. So she said they had to be able to understand how their human companions felt. Pearl: Wow! Robots that can understand people! Athena: I was just a convenient subject for her research. All she ever did was work, and she never paid any attention to me. ...Oh, sorry about that, dredging up all that old stuff... Phoenix: No need to apologize. (I guess her home life was... complicated...) Oh, by the way. Ms. Woods said something about you always wearing headphones...? Woods: She always wore these big, heavy-looking headphones. She said her mother made them for her, as part of her research. Athena: I had to wear them every time I went out. Oh, I hated them so much! But she wouldn't listen... Pearl: What were they for? Athena: Oh, she gave me some kind of explanation... ...but I don't remember now. It was too difficult for a little kid to understand. Phoenix: Okay... But let me say this one thing. I don't think your mother only thought of you as some handy subject for her research. Athena: I... I want to believe that. But just about the only things my mother left me with are Widget... ...and this earring. Pearl: Ooh! It's beautiful! Athena: It's made of a piece of real moon rock she had for research. Maybe she did love me, in her own way... Phoenix: I'm sure of it. I'm really sure she did. (Because that's what I want to believe, too.) Moon Rock Earring added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (I'd better ask her a little more about her mother's research. I should show her that paper I found in the robotics lab.) Your mother's work (appears after \"The day of the crime\") Phoenix: What kind of research was Dr. Cykes... your mother... doing?

I should show her that paper I found in the robotics lab.) Seven years ago (appears after \"Your mother's work\", then presenting Robots with a Heart) Phoenix: On a different subject... Did you hear about the person holding up the Space Center? Athena: Yes, a little. And this person has even taken hostages? Phoenix: (I guess I'd better spare her the news about Trucy...) Well... ...after some negotiating, we agreed to do a retrial of the case from seven years ago. Athena: What? You're kidding me! So that means... Prosecutor Blackquill might...?! Phoenix: Yup. I know he's innocent. I just have to prove it. So, wait. Did you know him back then? Athena: Yes. He used to come visit my mom a lot. He studied psychology under her, and would sometimes ask for advice on his legal cases. He was very kind and considerate, and straight as an arrow. Phoenix: (Unlike now, where he's more twisted than a basket of snakes...) Athena: That's why I took the witness stand during his trial seven years ago. \"Please! You have to listen to me!\" Athena: \"He didn't kill her! His heart is screaming that he didn't kill her!\" Athena: I was a fool. How could anybody else know what I was talking about? Phoenix: (She heard... the voice of his heart...) Pearl: You were only eleven then, right? You were very brave just to give testimony. Phoenix: Pearls is right. You did the very best you could at the time. Athena: But... nothing I said did any good. I was a shaking and scared little girl, small and ineffectual. Even after I went to live with my relatives in Europe, I stayed closed up in my shell. Pearl: But you're different now! You're always so bright and cheerful! Athena: Thanks. That's because one day, I came to realize that I had to fight. I couldn't give up. I exercised hard and I studied hard. I wanted to become the strongest lawyer I could be. Why you became a lawyer (appears after \"Seven years ago\") Leads to: \"I wanted to save Simon, but I had no idea how.\" Present Robots with a Heart (after clearing \"Your mother's work\" Talk option) Athena: Oh, the Ponco series! You must've gone to the robotics lab. Phoenix: You seem to really love Ponco and Clonco. Athena: Yeah, my mother made them and I grew up around them, you know. Pearl: Oh, there's one of those cute little robots in this photo, too. Athena: Ha ha. See Ponco's bandages? I put those on her. I just wound them around and around. Pretty bad job, huh? But I really put my all into it. I hardly left the Center in those days, so I didn't have any human friends besides Junie. I didn't really understand the difference between robots and people back then. I thought that if a robot broke, bandaging it would help it get better. What a weirdo I was! Phoenix: It looks like there's something written on the bandages. Athena: Yeah, I wrote stuff like, \"Get well soon, Ponco!\" But, in the end, my mom just put her on the operating table and fixed her in a flash. Pearl: Oh! That must be the thing I made move in the robotics lab. Athena: I was so impressed by what my mom did. I even asked me if she would put me on the table and fix me if I ever got hurt. It looked just like magic to me, what she could do. Phoenix: (A little girl who grew up around robots... She seems to have some good memories of it.) Terran's Autopsy Report or Utility Knife Athena: Could it have been me who killed Clay...? Did I kill Apollo's friend...? Phoenix: Of course you didn't! We all believe in you. Athena: I hope that includes Apollo... Anything else Athena: *sigh* I wonder if I'll ever get the chance to present evidence like that again... I'll probably never work as a lawyer again now... Phoenix: Don't talk like that, Athena! We're going to clear you of all suspicion. Just you wait! Athena: I hope you can... I really hope you can... Athena: I wanted to save Simon, but I had no idea how. Then I met Mr. Wright, and thanks to him... ...I realized that if I became a lawyer, I could prove that Simon was innocent. I also realized that psychology could help me do this. I mean... ...psychology was my mother's specialty. When I studied it... ...I felt like she was there with me, supporting me. Phoenix: (It doesn't seem like Athena knows... ...that Prosecutor Blackquill is due to be executed tomorrow.) Athena: I wanted to prove Simon's innocence personally. I wanted to do it so bad... Even now, I want to fly out of here and go save him! Phoenix: (Come to think of it, she said something like that during the Themis Legal Academy trial. She mentioned there was somebody she wanted to save... She must've been talking about Prosecutor Blackquill...) Athena: I heard some prison guards say that you had an interview with Simon. How was he? What did he say? Phoenix: ............! (No! I can't tell her! But how can I lie to Athena?!) ...He was doing well. He was happy about the possibility of being proven innocent. Athena: He was? I wonder if he smiled, like he used to... back then... Phoenix: (If I can't prove Prosecutor Blackquill's innocence in this trial... ...I don't think Athena will ever forgive me... I just have to free him! Failure is not an option here!) Fulbright: Ah, I thought you might be here! Mr. Lawyer, we're in trouble! Phoenix: W-We are? What is it? Fulbright: I couldn't find a single open courtroom. They're all in session. Pearl: Oh, no! But this is an emergency! Fulbright: Hmm... It's very difficult to interrupt a trial once it's underway... Phoenix: My phone! ...It's from Trucy! ???: I told you I'd give you one hour. I guess it's time to pick one of the hostages... Phoenix: No! Wait! We still have a little more time! Besides... all of the courtrooms are being used right now! ???: Make all the excuses you want, but you won't get more time. Your daughter is first. The poor thing. She's a little too young to die, don't you think? Phoenix: NO! Don't you dare hurt her! (There has to be something I can do!) Fulbright: Nnngh... The cruelest injustice is about to befall us! Pearl: No! This can't be happening! Mystic Maya... help us! Phoenix: (Wait a minute... Maya...?) I read somewhere that you were holding a trial in the middle of an exploding courtroom? That must've really been something, although weird is par for the course with you. Phoenix: (A courtroom... blew up...! That's it! There IS a courtroom we can use after all!) ???: Okay, time's up! Too bad. Any last words you'd like to say to her? Phoenix: Phoenix: Aura, please don't add to the crimes you've already committed. ???: So you know who I am, do you? It wasn't like I was trying to keep it a secret anyway... Phoenix: We're ready to start the trial. We can hold it in the ruins of Courtroom No. 4, the one blown up by the bomber. Pearl: Oh! What a wonderful idea, Mr. Nick! Fulbright: I... I never would have thought of that! An astonishing trial in an astonishing location! I guess it's only befitting. I'll go get the place ready right away! Phoenix: (I didn't exactly pick the place for its \"astonishing\" factor...) How about it? Are you ready to have your brother's innocence proven? ???: My brother...? Heh. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Oh, I'm sorry. Did I forget to mention...? It's not Simon you'll be defending. Phoenix: What? (Not... Prosecutor Blackquill...?) ???: I indict Athena Cykes, on the charge of murdering her own mother! You'll be defending the little princess there, the one behind the glass. Phoenix: (WH-WHAAAT?!) ???: See you in that mountain of rubble you've chosen for our courtroom, Mr. Wright! Pearl: What is she talking about? Athena...?! Athena: Of course... Why didn't it ever occur to me before? If Prosecutor Blackquill is innocent, somebody else had to have been the true culprit. Did I..? Did I... kill my own mother...? N-No......... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! 5 BLACK PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: ! No way... It can't be true! Pearl: Mr. Nick! What's the matter?! Phoenix: I see... I see five black Psyche-Locks! (I've seen these kinds of locks before... Dark, black locks protecting a secret deep inside a person's heart... (And there's no way to remove them!) To be continued Wright Anything Agency (before clearing \"Why you became a lawyer\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room) Talk What to do Pearl: What a terrible situation this is! Phoenix: Trucy... I still can't believe it... Pearl: Trucy will be all right, Mr. Nick. She's such a strong girl. Phoenix: Yeah... I'm sure she's hanging in there. (But if anything were to happen to her...) S-She's counting on us, Pearls, so let's get out there and do what we can! Pearl: I agree! Any ideas? Pearl: That robot named Clonco... He's very articulate, isn't he? Phoenix: That wasn't the robot talking. It was the hostage-taker speaking through him. Pearl: What? You mean... there was a person inside the robot? Phoenix: No, it's not like that, Pearls. Pearl: Hmm? Then... what do you mean? Phoenix: How can I explain it? It's kind of like a telephone. Pearl: So it wasn't a robot. It was a telephone? Phoenix: Yes... No... Hold on. Now I'M confused! Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: Nothing special here. Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I think I have enough evidence, but maybe I should do a bit more thinking first...)\n-- The Embodiment of Justice --Fulbright: Ha ha ha ha! I am the very embodiment of justice itself!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The \"embodiment of justice\"?! Those are just empty words! Fulbright: But they say if you keep saying something, it can eventually become the truth! Isn't that how people make their dreams come true, too? By wishing over and over? Phoenix: All right, all right. Let's just move on.Fulbright: I won't have you make me into a villain with your far-fetched arguments!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: My arguments are hardly \"far-fetched\"! There's careful reasoning behind my theory! Fulbright: Yes, well, apparently there's \"reasoning\" behind even a tofu burger. But what we have against Ms. Cykes, though, is not just \"reasoning,\" but solid evidence. And it's called the lighter, with Ms. Cykes's fingerprints on it in the victim's blood! Phoenix: Yes, that's true, but... (But wait... Detective Fulbright was the one who brought that evidence to the trial...) Blackquill: If you harbor any suspicions, I suggest you ask Fool Bright, Wright-dono. Especially about that lighter... Phoenix: (He's right. But what exactly should I ask about...?) The number of prints (before adding either statement) Phoenix: So, how many prints were found exactly? Fulbright: Three: the thumb, the index finger, and the middle finger of a right hand! Phoenix: Your Honor, that is an important statement! Could we please have it-- Fulbright: Added to my testimony? You got it! Judge: ...He beat me to it. Fulbright: Ha ha ha! Be it investigating or testifying, speed is the key! Adds statement \"Three prints were on the lighter: the thumb, index, and middle fingers of a right hand!\" The number of prints (after adding statement \"Three prints were on the lighter: the thumb, index, and middle fingers of a right hand!\") Phoenix: (No, wait a minute. He already answered this one. He's even added a statement about it to his testimony already.) Leads back to cross-examination The number of prints (after adding statement \"The prints were placed just the way they would be if someone were holding it lit.\") Phoenix: So, how many prints were found exactly? Fulbright: Three: the thumb, the index finger, and the middle finger of a right hand! Phoenix: Your Honor, that is an important statement! Could we please have it-- Fulbright: Swapped into my testimony? You got it! Judge: ...He beat me to it. Fulbright: Ha ha ha! Be it investigating or testifying, speed is the key! Changes statement from \"The prints were placed just the way they would be if someone were holding it lit.\" to \"Three prints were on the lighter: the thumb, index, and middle fingers of a right hand!\" The position of the prints (before adding either statement) Phoenix: Please tell the court about the position of the prints on the lighter. Fulbright: They're around the same spot on either side, as they would be if she were holding it up. Phoenix: Hmm... I suppose if it was used to light the room, it would be held that way. Could you please add that statement to your testimony? Adds statement \"The prints were placed just the way they would be if someone were holding it lit.\" The position of the prints (after adding statement \"Three prints were on the lighter: the thumb, index, and middle fingers of a right hand!\") Phoenix: Please tell the court about the position of the prints on the lighter.

Fulbright: Well, I'd much rather expound on the topic of justice, but oh, all right. Phoenix: (Let's see. What should I ask about?) About Aura Blackquill (before adding either statement) Phoenix: Please tell the court what you remember about Ms. Blackquill at the time. Fulbright: She appeared to be really angry that the bombing commotion was disrupting her work. She even threw a robot at me. Phoenix: (Yikes. I hope it wasn't poor Clonco.) Fulbright: This is very important information, isn't it! I'll just add this statement then! Phoenix: (Um, why don't you let me decide that...?) Adds statement \"Ms. Blackquill was extremely crabby about having her work interrupted!\" About Aura Blackquill (after adding statement \"Ms. Blackquill was extremely crabby about having her work interrupted!\") Phoenix: (No, wait a minute.

Fulbright: The lab, huh? Well, it was so messy, there was hardly anywhere to step. I guess they were in the middle of building a giant robot. Phoenix: (Yeah, that's pretty much how it looked when we visited this afternoon, too.) Fulbright: Okay, I know the drill! You want me to add this statement to my testimony, don't you! Phoenix: What? No, um.. Fulbright: Way ahead of you! I'll just add it in!

Leads back to cross-examinationFulbright: What we DO have is proof that Athena Cykes is the culprit: this lighter with her prints on it!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You mean the lighter that was found in the Space Museum, is that right? Fulbright: The one and only! After Ms. Cykes murdered Mr. Terran, she escaped into the Space Museum. That's when she probably dropped the lighter. Then, after the launch pads were switched, she ran out of the Space Museum... ...where her image was caught by the security camera! Phoenix: (Without evidence I should probably save this fight for another time...)Fulbright: Three prints were on the lighter: the thumb, index, and middle fingers of a right hand!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So three prints from a right hand were found on the lighter, huh? Are you certain of this? Fulbright: I'd stake my life on it! Apollo: Mr. Wright, isn't it odd he's saying the prints are from Athena's right hand? Phoenix: Why would you say that? Apollo: Well, think about it for a sec. Athena always wears that glove on her right hand, right? So there's no way she'd leave prints of those three fingers from her right hand. Phoenix: Hey, great point! (Why didn't I catch that one?) Detective Fulbright! I'm sure you heard our discussion just now. About how Ms. Cykes always wears a glove on her right hand! Fulbright: Ha ha ha! Well, I have only one thing to say to that! Do you have any evidence that she was wearing that glove at the time of the incident? Phoenix: ............I guess we don't. Fulbright: If you want to prove the defendant innocent, you'll have to ask better questions than that. Phoenix: (Like I need a lecture from you, Smiles McGoo... Hmm... Should I try asking him about something else?) The prints' position Phoenix: Please tell the court about the position of the prints on the lighter. Fulbright: They're around the same spot on either side, as they would be if she were holding it up. Phoenix: Hmm... I suppose if it was used to light the room, it would be held that way.

Fulbright: Yup! Meaning the person Ms. Blackquill saw was the owner of the fingerprints! It just strengthens the argument against Ms. Cykes! Phoenix: (Ugh... This line of questioning is going to get me anywhere except Convictionland... Hmm... should I try asking him something else?) The number of prints Phoenix: So, how many prints were found exactly?

Fulbright: Well, they already took her down to the station, so it's a bit late to ask her now. Apollo: Just my opinion, but maybe it's best we DON'T ask her about that... Ever. Phoenix: (Hmm. Should I try asking the detective something else?) About the lab Phoenix: Please tell us anything you remember about the lab. Fulbright: The lab, huh?

You chose the ladder in that very room on purpose to create your escape route! Fulbright: That's not true! It's just that, when it comes to ladders, I'm very particular. I had a good feeling about that ladder! Apollo: Uh, this isn't getting us anywhere, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Huh? Did I mess up somewhere along the way?) About Aura Blackquill Phoenix: Please tell the court what you remember about Ms. Blackquill at the time. Fulbright: She appeared to be really angry that the bombing commotion was disrupting her work.

Apollo: Let's press him on everything until he cracks!After adding statement \"Three prints were on the lighter: the thumb, index, and middle fingers of a right hand!\" Apollo: Hmm... This statement that was added... I'm not sure if it's relevant or not. Phoenix: Well, at least he seems willing to answer our questions. Let's keep asking about different things and see if we can uncover an inconsistency. (Detective Fulbright is a tougher adversary than I'd thought...)Phoenix: You say the prints were from a right hand, is that correct?!Fulbright: That's right! Very clear prints!Phoenix: But that just doesn't add up.Fulbright: Huh? What doesn't add up?Phoenix: According to Ms. Blackquill, who saw the culprit herself... ...this person held the lighter in their left hand.Fulbright: Oh?Phoenix: So here is the dilemma before us: Why are the prints on the lighter from a right hand instead of a left?!Fulbright: Ngaaagh!Judge: Hmm! You're right! It doesn't make sense, does it?Phoenix: Your Honor, this lighter can hardly be called incriminating evidence! The witness's CLAIMS don't even hold water!Judge: Detective Fulbright! I hope you have a good explanation for this!Fulbright: Hmm... I just can't understand it. They're definitely right-hand prints. But then, why are they inconsistent with Ms. Blackquill's statement...? Hmm... I've got it!Judge: Wh-What have you got, Detective?Fulbright: The mirror! The witness must have seen a reflection of the culprit in the mirror!Judge: Go on!Fulbright: Ms. Blackquill was looking in through the window of Boarding Lounge 1, wasn't she?!Phoenix: I believe so... ...if you mean the little window in the back and to the right of the room.Fulbright: That's right. And across the room on the opposite wall... ...is a large mirror.Phoenix: Hmm... I do remember seeing it... ............Aaaah! So are you saying...?!Fulbright: Yes, the culprit Ms. Blackquill saw must have been a reflection of that person in the mirror.Judge: Ah, I see. In that case, right and left would appear reversed, wouldn't they?Fulbright: Ha ha ha ha ha! Now do you see?! That's the logic of pure justice!Phoenix:Phoenix: But your argument is only conjecture! You don't have any proof that what Ms. Blackquill saw was a reflection--Blackquill:Blackquill: Wright-dono, you'd sooner nick yourself than him like that. Put some more muscle into it.Phoenix: Huh?Fulbright: Ha ha ha ha! That's right! Besides, the lighter couldn't have been in the left hand!Phoenix: And why not?Fulbright: Ms. Blackquill said she saw an Earth emblem on the lighter, didn't she? That emblem is only on one side of the lighter.Phoenix: ...You're right. There's no emblem on the other side.Fulbright: Exactly! As blank and smooth as the judge's fine scalp! If the culprit had held the lighter in their left hand, they would've covered the emblem.Phoenix: Uh oh...Fulbright: What's more, this is the kind of lighter you flick open with your thumb before lighting. So if the culprit had held it in their left hand with the emblem out and visible... ...they wouldn't have been able to open it, let alone light it. But if they had held it in their right hand, they could easily open it and light it. This all means that the culprit was definitely holding the lighter in their right hand!Phoenix: Noooooooooooooooooooooo! (Come baaack, my beautiful contradiction!)Blackquill: ...Hmph. It appears you've planted a flower that bears no fruit.Fulbright: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! See how it withers before my flower of justice?!Phoenix: He's tough! He's managed to discredit almost everything I've proven up this point...Fulbright: In justice we trust! Now do you see? I'm not this \"phantom\" you've been talking about. I mean, are you sure there really is a spy? I bet they're just a figment of your imagination! *sob* Oh, it's so sad! So very sad! But I'm afraid Ms. Cykes is the culprit!Apollo:Apollo: Detective Fulbright, I believe you said... ...that the emblem is only on one side of the lighter. Are you sure about that?Fulbright: Hmm? Of course I'm sure! Why don't you take a look for yourself and see? Do YOU see an Earth emblem on both sides of the lighter?BRACELET THUMPSApollo: ............I knew it. You're lying, Detective.Fulbright: P-Pardon me?Phoenix: You mean...?Apollo: Yes, my bracelet reacted to his statement about the emblem. He's definitely hiding something big. And I think if we use my talent, we might be able to figure it out.Blackquill: Justice-dono, are you to use that cheat of yours again?Apollo: It's not cheating, Prosecutor Blackquill!Blackquill: Hmph. Very well. Whether I like it or not, I suppose we should use whatever works right now. Go on, then.Phoenix: We have Prosecutor Blackquill's reluctant blessing, apparently. Okay, Apollo, you're up!Apollo: Here goes, then...! Detective Fulbright, could you repeat that last statement one more time?Fulbright: What in the world are you up to? Hmm............ All right. Fine. I'll say it as many times as you like! Listen carefully! The Earth emblem is only on the side that you can see when held in the right hand.Perceive left thumb on holster on \"The Earth emblem\" Apollo: Leads to: \"Detective Fulbright, you might not be aware of it yourself, but...\"Perceive wrong area Apollo: Apollo: Aha! I spy a nervous tic! Fulbright: A tick? Maybe I should squash it then! Apollo: (That's not the kind of tic I had in mind...) Um, could you please repeat your statement? Leads back to: \"I'll say it as many times as you like! Listen carefully!\"Apollo: Detective Fulbright, you might not be aware of it yourself, but... ...whenever you say the phrase \"The Earth emblem,\" your left thumb moves. In fact, it appears as though you're running it along the edge of your holster.Fulbright: M-Mr. Lawyer, I don't have the foggiest notion what you're talking about.Apollo: Be that as it may, I know it has something to do with the lighter. Let me examine it.Fulbright: But why? You're not making any sense! You can't just--Blackquill:Blackquill: Hmph! Be still and do as you're told, Fool Bright. If you have nothing to hide, you shouldn't mind them having a look-see, should you?Fulbright: What...?! Not you too, Prosecutor Blackquill...!Judge: Hmm... I'm not sure what this is all about, but if Prosecutor Blackquill insists... ...it must be something important. I will allow the defense to examine the lighter.Fulbright: ............Nnnghhh...Apollo: Good! Now maybe we'll learn something new!Phoenix: I hope so. Now, let's check every inch of this thing.Examine bloodstains on front Apollo: Hmm. It's hard to tell if the prints are from a right hand or a left just by looking. Phoenix: I don't think looking at each print with the naked eye will tell us anything new. But this lighter definitely hides a secret... Apollo: I agree. Let's check it out carefully.Examine bloody prints on back Phoenix: Ugh... The back is covered with blood. Apollo: Say, do you notice anything funny about this bloodstain? Phoenix: You're right. It suddenly breaks off unnaturally. Apollo: Supposedly, the lighter was held with the right hand so that the emblem was visible. If so, the prints should be around the emblem and on the lid where you open it. Phoenix: You're right. There's definitely something off here.Examine top of lid Phoenix: I don't see anything unusual about the top of the lid. Apollo: But Detective Fulbright's words were definitely hiding something. Let's look for something that has to do with what he said.Examine moon emblem Phoenix: There's a moon here in relief. Apollo: I guess it's designed to go with the Earth. If anything is suspicious about this lighter, it's probably in this area... Phoenix: I don't see anything add about this, though.Examine Earth emblem Leads to: \"So this is the Earth emblem Detective Fulbright was talking about.\"Phoenix: So this is the Earth emblem Detective Fulbright was talking about.Apollo: See anything noteworthy?Phoenix: ...Huh? H-Hey! Look at this! The emblem's actually some kind of button!Apollo: Wow! It transformed... into something...Phoenix: A handle, a trigger. Is this what I think it is...?Blackquill: ............There's no question, it seems. What you have there is a gun.Judge: A WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!Phoenix: A gun............ So that's it. Your Honor, please recall this morning's trial, when Director Cosmos was on the stand. The bullet that hit the oxygen tank was extremely small, maybe a .10 caliber. This little compact gun probably takes bullets of that caliber.Apollo: It looks like this is the gun that was fired at the scene.Judge: I'm flabbergasted! The lighter... was a gun?!Phoenix: So when Detective Fulbright would touch his holster...Apollo: That's right. Whenever he mentioned the Earth emblem... ...he must have subconsciously thought about the secret behind the lighter. In other words, he knew it was a gun from the very beginning.Fulbright: ............Apollo: A lighter that transforms into a gun seems like a spy gadget to me. It's not the kind of thing any ordinary person can get their hands on. In fact, I'd say it's strictly in the domain of elite spies! Detective Fulbright, you WILL explain yourself!Fulbright: ............ Ha ha ha ha ha! There's nothing for me to explain! I didn't know the lighter could transform! I mean, it was found in the Space Museum, and then I brought it straight in! ............I didn't even have time to check it out.Apollo:Apollo: Whenever you mentioned the Earth emblem, you touched your holster! You subconsciously did that because you knew it was a gun!Fulbright: Accuse me all you want, but where is your proof?! Do you have any evidence that I knew the lighter was a gun?Apollo: ...Not exactly...Fulbright: And whose prints are on it? Ms. Cykes's prints! It proves that she's the culprit who fired the gun at the scene!Apollo: Argh!Judge: I-It would appear that the detective is right...Fulbright: Are you guys really trying to prove your client innocent or what?! ...Although it pains me to do this, now that we are where we are... ...I have to make the following assertions, coming from the prosecution's side. The person who fired the gun at Director Cosmos in the lounge after the incident... ...and the person Ms. Blackquill saw holding the lighter... ...and the person who murdered Mr. Terran... ...and the person who bombed the Space Center... ...are all the defendant, Athena Cykes! The prints on the lighter are decisive proof!Apollo: Noooooooooooooooooooooooooo!Fulbright: Ha ha ha! Now do you see? A man on the side of justice couldn't possibly be the culprit! And I think this about sums up Ms. Cykes's part in the whole affair.Judge: The evidence certainly does seem to point to the defendant's guilt. Do you have anything to say, Prosecutor Blackquill?Blackquill: ...Evidence is everything in court. Therefore, Fool Bright's claims... stand firm.Apollo: B-But...!Phoenix: Calm down, Apollo. He's just saying that because he has to as the prosecutor.Fulbright: Mr. Lawyer, our job is to pursue criminals in the name of justice! You shouldn't cast suspicion on people based on something as dubious as a habit! In fact, you have a bad habit of showing up in court with an awful case of bed head!Apollo:Apollo: Says the man who wears sunglasses at night. If it's proof you want, it's proof you'll get! I'll prove that lighter is not Ms. Cykes's, but yours!Fulbright: Hmm?Phoenix: Sounds like you've hit on something, Apollo.Apollo: It's just, if the prints on the lighter are the basis for accusing Athena... ...I think we should reconsider the credibility of the evidence itself.Phoenix: You mean, you think this lighter might be forged evidence?!Apollo: That's right. It could all be part of Fulbright's bigger plot. Did he do anything out of the ordinary while I was off on my own?Phoenix: ...I can definitely think of a few things.Fulbright: It is, indeed! Have a look at this!Judge: What's this? A lighter?Athena: Detective, we'd like to run a comparison on some prints we found in the boarding lounge.Fulbright: Ah, yes! I just happened to have compiled the print data of everyone related to this case! I can always make another copy for myself, so it's all yours! Consider it a gift.Phoenix: (If we assume he's been laying a big trap for us all along... There's gotta be something off about this piece of evidence. What's wrong with the lighter as a piece of evidence?)How the prints were left on it Phoenix: (No, I guess I don't see anything strange about how the prints were left on the lighter... Nothing unusual about the angle of the prints or how they are patchy in places, but...) Leads back to: \"There's gotta be something off about this piece of evidence.\"The owner of the prints Leads to: \"Are they really Athena's fingerprints?\"Where the prints are on it Phoenix: (Anything odd about where the prints are? No, I guess if it was fired as a gun... ...that's about where the prints would be, but...) Leads back to: \"There's gotta be something off about this piece of evidence.\"Phoenix: (Are they really Athena's fingerprints? They definitely matched her print data... Hmm... But what about the data itself...?) Detective Fulbright, you were the one who provided us with the lighter and print data... ...isn't that correct?Fulbright: ............Yes. What about it?Phoenix: You say Ms. Cykes's prints matched the print data... ...but I have to wonder, was the data you used official?Judge: M-Mr. Wright! Are you suggesting that the evidence might have been fabricated?!Phoenix: I guess there's only one way to find out. Let's re-examine the prints... ...using the official, sanctioned print data of the people involved in this case.Fulbright: What?! You dare insult the epitome of justice and integrity?! There's no need for such antics!Blackquill:Blackquill: Your Honor, I lend my voice to the defense's request. You must allow the test to be re-run.Judge: Very well, then... Bailiff!Judge: Ah! It appears that the official data is here.Phoenix: And the results?Judge: Hmm... Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm............ It's... It's just as the defense claims... This proves that the prints on the lighter do not belong to the defendant!Fulbright: NGAAAAAAAAAH!Phoenix: Yes!Judge: The fingerprints actually belong to the victim, Mr. Clay Terran.Lighter updated in the Court Record.Apollo: They were Clay's fingerprints on the lighter...?Blackquill: Ah, I see. Come to think of it... ...wasn't it you, Fool Bright, who collected the victim's prints?Fulbright: I personally removed his glove during the investigation. We had to get his fingerprints to confirm his identity, after all.Blackquill: When you took the deceased's fingerprints... ...you could have easily planted his prints on the lighter with his blood. After which, you wiped the blood off of his hand.Fulbright: Ngaaah.Phoenix: By your own admission, you were also the one who compiled the phony print data. All to put the blame on Ms. Cykes!Fulbright: NGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!Phoenix: This ploy must've been to distract us from the phantom who was behind everything. You were out to create the impression that the phantom wasn't the true culprit.Judge: S-So does this mean... Detective Fulbright really IS the phantom?Phoenix: Remember the killer's escape route. No ordinary person... ...would have been fearless enough to attempt it. Nobody but the phantom -- the man with no emotions -- could've done it.Fulbright: NGAAAAAAAAAGH!Phoenix: Detective Fulbright, you were the only one who could've used that escape route.Fulbright: Ngaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! I... I...!Blackquill: Fool Bright! Are you really the phantom?Fulbright: ............Blackquill: Answer me, or so help me I will slash you to tiny slivers where you stand!Fulbright: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! All right! All right! I'll talk! I-I confess. ............I... I'm not the phantom.Blackquill:Blackquill: It's all over. Now be a man and admit it already!Fulbright: B-But I'm not a spy! ............I'm an undercover investigator. I've actually been after the phantom myself.Judge: An under-the-cover investigator...? That sounds less than wholesome to me...Blackquill: ...A person who hides his identity and secretly investigates in order to uncover information. And that's what you really are, Fool Bright?Fulbright: That's right, I was working to track down the phantom... But, sadly... ...even though I was supposed to catch the spy, the spy ended up catching me. He took my family hostage and forced me to cooperate with him.Judge: What?Phoenix:Phoenix: You're telling us this NOW?! But if what you say is true, then... ...who was the mystery person Ms. Blackquill and Mr. Starbuck saw?Fulbright: It was the phantom, I tell you! All I did was help him by having that emergency ladder lowered for him!Apollo:Apollo: I don't believe you! Then how do you explain the fabricated lighter?!Fulbright: That was also one of the phantom's demands. Being the detective in charge of the case, it was easy for me to fabricate evidence. Pinning the crime on Athena Cykes was just another one of the phantom's orders!Apollo: And you expect me to buy that?!Blackquill: ...Fool Bright, what was the phantom's ultimate objective?Fulbright: I was told it was to sabotage the rocket launch. ...Someone who didn't want the launch to happen must've given him the order.Blackquill: ............Fulbright: Actually, I have to apologize to you, too. The phantom told me to get close to you. He ordered me to get back that psych profile you have on him.Blackquill: ............So, he sent a buzzard of his own to tail me this past year, did he?Fulbright: I... I haven't been a champion of justice... ............I've just been a pawn of evil... ...a pawn of the phantom who stole the moon rock and killed Dr. Cykes seven years ago...Blackquill: ...Enough, Fool Bright. Just tell us the phantom's true identity.Fulbright: I don't know. He was very careful to hide it. He has top secret information for all kinds of corporations and countries... ...so there's a number of organizations that want him dead. If people believed I was the phantom... ...I could be killed on the spot! Why, I bet even now... ...there are assassins lurking nearby! This case is about the phantom after all.Blackquill: ...With the ceiling blown off, I suppose you are vulnerable to a sniper's shot in this courtroom.Phoenix: (Just two seconds ago, Fulbright was treating Athena like a criminal... Does he really think he's going to lie his way out of it now?)Apollo: But on the surface, everything does seem to make sense. This could be bad, Mr. Wright, if we can't find a flaw in his logic!Phoenix: (He's right! After we've come all this way, we can't let Fulbright wriggle free now!)Fulbright: There. I finally told the truth.Now I hope you see how foolish it was to think I was the phantom!Fulbright: You're an intelligent man, Prosecutor Blackquill. You believe me, right?Blackquill: ............I believe you. I don't think you're the phantom.Phoenix: What?! How can you say that, Prosecutor Blackquill?! It's obvious he's the phantom!Blackquill:Blackquill: Evidence is everything, Wright-dono. And you must admit there's no clear evidence that Fool Bright is the phantom.Phoenix: Ngah.Judge: Hmm... Yes. As I recall, the only solid proof we've seen up to this point... ...is the fact that Detective Fulbright fabricated evidence.Phoenix: B-But...!Fulbright: ............Blackquill: ...I've known Fool Bright here for a year now. And all this time, he's been quite intent on rehabilitating me. I don't believe his efforts were a lie.Fulbright: P-Prosecutor Blackquill!Blackquill: This fool truly thought he could reform a death-row inmate like me. He went so out of his way in his efforts for me, he actually became quite a nuisance, really.Fulbright: *sob* Prosecutor Blackquill! You believe meeeeeeee!Phoenix: (Please tell me Prosecutor Blackquill hasn't REALLY been taken in by this big phony?!)Blackquill: However, even if it was against your will... ...you still acted as the phantom's accomplice. You will have to pay the price for that. Throw yourself at my mercy! And don't you ever betray me again! Have you got that?!Fulbright: ............Y-Yes! Thank you! Oh, thank yooooou!Judge: *sniffle* *sniffle* *sniffle* S-Such a bond of trust is a rare and beautiful thing...! In any case, it looks like everything has been resolved. I can now hand down a \"not guilty\" verdict with confidence.Fulbright: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Very good! I'm very glad to hear it! It's all over. Everything's been cleared up, and Ms. Cykes will go free as well!Athena: ............Apollo: M-Mr. Wright! We can't let the trial end here! If we do, the phantom -- the man who killed Clay -- will get away!Phoenix: I know! I know! But...! (Argh! What do I do?! I don't have any proof that Detective Fulbright is the phantom! Is this it...? Is he going to get away just like that...?)Fulbright: Now, if you'll excuse me, my next investigation awaits! And with that............ I'm off!???:Athena: The defense-- No, wait... Not \"the defense\"... The defendant feels it's not time for a verdict yet, and would like to see this trial continue.Judge: Wh-What?! But I was just about to declare you innocent of all charges!Athena: ............Hmm... It just doesn't feel right to be standing here. Hey, Apollo! Think you could scooch over?Phoenix: Athena, what are you doing?! (Hope we don't get held in contempt of court!)Athena: I have some questions for you, Detective Fulbright. Are you relieved that you are no longer under suspicion of being the phantom? Are you grateful to Prosecutor Blackquill for what he's done for you?Fulbright: O-Of course I am! And I'm truly grateful from the bottom of my heart!Phoenix: Athena, where are you going with these questions?Athena: I have yet to hear a single emotion behind any of Detective Fulbright's words, Boss. The suspicion against him has been cleared up, but he's not feeling happy at all.Phoenix: What? Does that mean...?!Athena: We may not have any evidence, but the heart doesn't lie!Phoenix: That's it! With your special ability, we just might be able to stop him!Athena: Your Honor! The detective has been deeply traumatized by our accusations!Judge: Hmm... Yes, well... Even before all this, I thought he was a rather odd fellow...Athena: If he doesn't get counseling right away, who knows what might happen to him?!Fulbright: Hee hee hee hee! Hoo hoo hoo! HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA! Prosecutor Blackquill! Can you believe the nonsense the defense is spouting?!Blackquill:...Hmph.Fool Bright, I think you'd better have that counseling.Fulbright: Not you, too?!Blackquill: You've been making batty remarks ever since you were accused of being the phantom... ...such as, you're an undercover investigator, and your family has been taken hostage. ...I fear you might have finally lost it.Fulbright: B-B-But I thought you believed me...?!Blackquill:Blackquill: Ha ha ha ha ha! Oh, how you amuse me so!Phoenix: Wh-What's going on here?Athena: That was an excellent bit of psychological manipulation just now, Simon!Blackquill: I knew you would catch on, Athena.Phoenix: Huh? Mind filling me in here?Athena: Hee hee. Guess we left you in the dust, huh, Mr. Wright? Simon was only pretending to believe Detective Fulbright... Because he knew I'd notice if there was a lack of emotions, like joy or relief, in his response. So he gave me the chance to take a listen. And listen I did to the voice of Detective Fulbright's heart!Phoenix: Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?! You two were working together just now?!Blackquill: Come now, Athena! Show us what's inside Fool Bright's heart!Athena: You got it! Time to check the instant replay! Widget, mon ami! Let's do this!Fulbright: Thank you for believing in me, Prosecutor Blackquill!Fulbright: I am an undercover investigator, but the phantom was coercing me!Fulbright: He stole the moon rock and killed Dr. Cykes seven years ago!Fulbright: I'm a bad, bad person for cooperating with such a man!Fulbright: But he took my family hostage! What else could I do?!Phoenix: Even with all his over-the-top expressions and gestures, he's registering no emotion at all?!Athena: It's just like I thought, and right in line with the phantom's psych profile.Fulbright: ............Athena: Detective Fulbright! This lack of emotion proves you're the phantom! Hey! What's going on?!Phoenix: Wait! Hold it! What do you think you're doing, Detective?Fulbright: ............Me? I'm not doing anything.Athena: He's trying to hack into the Mood Matrix program! I can't do anything with it like this!Fulbright: Gaaagh!Blackquill: Fancy device you have there, but I'll tolerate no cheating, thank you.Fulbright: ............Ha ha ha! Sorry about that! As an undercover agent, I tend to use my secret arsenal without even thinking!Phoenix: (More like, as a spy...)Athena: Thanks, Prosecutor Blackquill! There! Now that you can't hack me anymore... ...I dare you to try to hide your lack of emotions from us!Fulbright: ............ Ha ha ha ha ha! Lack of emotion? What are you talking about? Of course I have feelings! *sob* As a matter of fact, you've wounded me very deeply with that accusation!Athena: What's going on?! All of a sudden, I'm getting an overwhelmingly happy reading!Apollo: Huh? But he's literally crying us a river over there...Fulbright: ............Oops. My mistake. How about this? Graaaagh!Athena: Yikes! Now he's angry all of a sudden?!Apollo: What's he trying to pull?Blackquill: Like as not, it would appear our friend is not completely without emotion. It's just as it says in Dr. Cykes's profile of the phantom. The subject has a \"unique psychological makeup with almost no emotional fluctuation.\"Athena: Oh, I get it! So he has SOME emotions, right?Blackquill: Precisely. Which leads me to wonder why you can't sense any emotion from him at all. I believe it's most likely because he is controlling his emotions.Fulbright: Very good, Prosecutor Blackquill! You are correct! It's the result of my daily training! A very important skill for us undercover investigators, you know!Phoenix: (More like, \"for us SPIES\"... Seriously. But I wonder why he suddenly showed several strong emotions...? Wait a minute... I think I know!) I sense there's a feeling you're trying to hide with your exaggerated emotions, Detective.Fulbright: Ha ha ha! A feeling I'm trying to hide? That's a good one! You're the ones who have been saying I'm the phantom because I don't have any emotions! I was just trying to show you the range of deep emotions I truly possess!Athena: Then you have no objections to me analyzing you, right?Fulbright: ...No. Analyze away. But I will state it again: I am not the phantom. And be forewarned that your analysis will have no effect! Because you're about to see what an undercover agent can really do!Fulbright: Me, the phantom?! No way!Fulbright: Oh, I'm so sad! *sob* See?! I told you I have emotions!Fulbright: How dare you accuse me of being someone who would kill over a moon rock?!Pinpoint Sad marker Phoenix: Leads to: \"I found it! I found the one emotion you're truly feeling!\"Fulbright: I do regret cooperating with the phantom, of course...Fulbright: But I'm so glad this whole misunderstanding is cleared up now!Phoenix: What the--?! How are we supposed to pick out what's unnatural from this mess?!Athena: I don't know what we can do with this, either...Phoenix: This must be his defenses against your ability.Athena: S-So you think this is what he meant by what he's really capable of?Apollo: I'd hate to know what's going on inside that guy's head...Phoenix: Well, we know he's hiding something, and that he feels threatened by Athena. Being only human, his true feelings -- an emotion he can't completely conceal... ...must be hidden somewhere in his testimony!Phoenix: I found it! I found the one emotion you're truly feeling!Fulbright: What...?Phoenix: Hidden in the middle of that chaotic storm, I saw one emotion that never disappeared. When you talked about the moon rock... ...you felt a fear that wouldn't fade!Fulbright: Fear... huh...Blackquill: Hmph. A fear that a man with hardly any emotions feels, huh?Athena: And it was a response to that moon rock!Fulbright: ............Phoenix: Detective Fulbright, I presume you feel fear concerning the moon rock because...Your identity will be revealed Leads to: \"...Of course! That's it!\"You lost it Phoenix: You lost the precious moon rock you went to so much trouble to get, didn't you? And that frustration has turned into fear in your heart! Fulbright: Oh, it's so frustrating! I can't stand it! Ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: I'm not so sure a man who could make that twenty-foot leap would feel fear about that... Phoenix: Yeah, I guess you're right... (Didn't the topic of what a spy might fear the most come up in our discussions earlier?) Leads back to: \"Detective Fulbright, I presume you feel fear concerning the moon rock because...\"You failed to steal it Phoenix: You tried but failed to steal the moon rock! That stain on your career as a spy has left you feeling afraid! Blackquill: But the moon rock did indeed disappear from the laboratory... Apollo: And I'd hardly think a person who feels so little would feel fear over a thing like that... Phoenix: Don't everyone jump on the Phoenix hype train all at once now... (Didn't the topic of what a spy might fear the most come up in our discussions earlier?) Leads back to: \"Detective Fulbright, I presume you feel fear concerning the moon rock because...\"Phoenix: ...Of course! That's it!Blackquill: ...Enough, Fool Bright. Just tell us the phantom's true identity.Fulbright: I don't know. He was very careful to hide it. He has top secret information for all kinds of corporations and countries... ...so there's a number of organizations that want him dead. If people believed I was the phantom... ...I could be killed on the spot! Why, I bet even now... ...there are assassins lurking nearby! This case is about the phantom after all.Phoenix: Detective Fulbright, I think I know why you would feel afraid. You are afraid that the moon rock will somehow reveal your identity.Fulbright: !Blackquill: If his identity were revealed, he would be killed immediately... That's certainly enough to make even the phantom feel afraid.Fulbright: Me, afraid? I don't know what you're talking about.Athena: So, there really is something about the moon rock that would reveal his identity...?Phoenix: Apparently so. Wait a minute... Maybe the phantom didn't so much STEAL the moon rock... ...but more like he HAD to take it with him? Because there was something on it that would reveal his true identity!Fulbright: ............Phoenix:Phoenix: Where do you think YOU'RE going?!Fulbright: ...Me? I'm not going anywhere.Apollo: Is it just me or was he going to use that weird watch thing to try to get away?Phoenix: (How many more of those toys does he have? And where can I get myself some?) Detective Fulbright! You will answer honestly to this court right now! Why do you feel fear in connection with the moon rock?!Fulbright: In JUSTICE we TRUST! Not emotions, Mr. Lawyer! Evidence is everything. I'm the phantom because I'm afraid? Don't make me laugh!Phoenix: Aaaaagh! (And what was THAT just now?!)Athena: But all humans beings have hearts and experience emotions. Sometimes analyzing a case from the psychological perspective... ...is the best way to find the truth! Eeeeek!Fulbright: ............It's all just a waste of time. All your efforts at analysis serve no purpose. And now, in this dark age of the law, nobody would believe your claim that it's effective. In an era when evidence is fabricated, do you truly expect feelings to be accepted as proof? And where exactly is your \"proof\" that I fear the moon rock anyway?Athena: Ungh! ...W-Well, I admit, I don't have any conventional proof... But I still say that examining a person's heart has its merits!Fulbright: Oh, really? Then why don't you listen carefully with those special ears of yours.Listen to the voices of the hearts of the people in the gallery.Athena: All I hear... is distrust...?Fulbright: As you can see, the people are on my side. Because all they see is a strange little girl using a weird little machine.Athena: But it's not like I use analytical psychology to falsely accuse people!Phoenix: (Uh-oh. He's got Athena doubting herself.) Ms. Cykes's analytical psychology has breathed new life into the courtroom. It has freed the hearts of many witnesses, and has been key in getting to the truth.Fulbright: Ha ha ha! What nonsense! Your Honor, the defense's claim is a false one! I don't feel any kind of fear when it comes to the moon rock!Judge: ............Hmm, I see. Very well. I will give the opinion of this court. In a trial, I don't feel that a person's emotions are quite as compelling as actual evidence is.Athena: B-But, Your Honor...Fulbright: Hee hee hee hee! Hoo hoo hoo! HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA! There! You see?! Nobody believes you and your trumped-up charges!Judge: However, I do believe Ms. Cykes's analyses can contribute to making the truth clear. I have seen her do this firsthand several times already.Fulbright: Surely you jest.Athena: So does this mean............ you will accept my findings in this trial, Your Honor?Judge: Yes, I believe your claim, Ms. Cykes. I think there is merit in examining why the witness feels fear in regard to the moon rock. That is the court's opinion on this matter.Athena: Then that's a win for me-- No, a win for analytical psychology! Now, Mr. Phantom, you will tell this court the reason for your fear!Fulbright: Analytical psychology? My fears? ............Fine! I'll show you precisely why those abstract things can't be considered evidence! Hee hee hee hee! Hoo hoo hoo! HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!Witness Testimony-- My Fear of the Moon Rock --Fulbright: I felt fear when I thought about the moon rock because it reminded me of the phantom. Yes, I'm very afraid of him because he took my family hostage. What reason would the phantom have to be afraid of the moon rock?! None at all! So the very fact that I'm afraid of the moon rock means I'm not him! In fact, I'm on the side of... JUSTICE!Fulbright: ...And there you have it. Now do you see why I'm afraid of the moon rock?Blackquill: Sure, you sound convincing enough. But so does any two-bit con artist. It's all meaningless in the absence of evidence.Fulbright: ............ Hmph!Blackquill: Hmph. The phantom is like the mist. No flesh. No bones. My sword alone cannot cut it, Wright-dono...Phoenix: !Blackquill: With your deductive reasoning and the body of evidence before us... ...let us send this miserable phantom fellow to the other world together.Phoenix: You and I, Prosecutor Blackquill... We have a duty to bring the phantom down, and restore the people's faith in the courts!Blackquill: Indeed. By covering for Athena, I allowed the phantom to escape. And as a prosecutor, I gave birth to the people's mistrust with my murder conviction.Phoenix: I bear part of the responsibility as well... ...for being suspected of forging evidence and losing my attorney's badge as a result. The two of us and the phantom were there at the beginning of the dark age of the law.Blackquill: Then it is also our burden to cut away the foul specter we created, is it not? Until all that remains is the righteousness of the court and the faith of the people!Fulbright: Hee hee hee hee! Hoo hoo hoo! HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA! Trust? Understanding? Hah! Fragile ideals of the masses who are controlled by emotion. Humans can't truly trust each other, which is exactly why the illusion of trust is so enticing.Phoenix:Phoenix: Once two people overcome their misgivings, that's where real trust is to be found. You're free to believe what you want, but... ...trust like that is stronger than you and your lies, always!Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- My Fear of the Moon Rock --Fulbright: I felt fear when I thought about the moon rock because it reminded me of the phantom.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: It only REMINDED you of the phantom?! Don't make me laugh. You ARE the phantom! Fulbright: Evidence is everything in a court of law... Or did you forget? I was forced to testify over a silly thing like \"feelings\"... ...but those tactics won't work from here on out! You need real evidence! Phoenix: (Argh... I hate to admit it, but he's right.)Fulbright: Yes, I'm very afraid of him because he took my family hostage.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Your family? Like, who in your family, specifically? Fulbright: Oh, I don't know... Like... maybe my lover, for example? Athena: \"For example\"?! \"Maybe\"?! We need a more concrete answer than that! Fulbright: Ha ha ha! Maybe... my mother? My son...? Or, my daughter! Maybe it was all of them! I'm so sad and worried! I miss them so much! Ha ha ha! Apollo: Argh! He's obviously lying! Fulbright: Look how upset I am! Is it any wonder I followed the phantom's orders?!Fulbright: What reason would the phantom have to be afraid of the moon rock?! None at all!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You can't think of a single reason that the phantom might be afraid of the rock? Fulbright: I thought the phantom wasn't even supposed to have any feelings? How can someone like me, with my wealth of emotions, be expected to understand the guy! Phoenix: (The phantom, a person with very few emotions... ...would only be afraid of something really big. Like his cover getting blown big... I'm willing to bet that the moon rock has something to do with his identity, but what?) Athena: Maybe the phantom's fingerprints are on the rock? Apollo: But fingerprints can be wiped off. Athena: Then maybe he wanted the rock so bad, he literally drooled on it and left his DNA? Apollo: We're dealing with a SPY here, Athena, not a SLOB... Phoenix: True............ But maybe the \"DNA\" isn't too far off... Apollo: Huh? Phoenix: (Something unexpected happened to him during the incident seven years ago... I just KNOW I have something that can show why the phantom is afraid of the moon rock!) Fulbright: I'll just continue with my testimony while you're pondering, then, if you don't mind!Present Utility Knife Phoenix: Leads to: \"Detective Fulbright, I assume you know what this is.\"Fulbright: So the very fact that I'm afraid of the moon rock means I'm not him!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: And how afraid are you, exactly? Fulbright: I'm so scared I start to shake even when I see the moon in the sky! Phoenix: Do you shake when you see Ms. Cykes's earring? Fulbright: Well, to be honest, since the very first time I met Ms. Cykes... ...I've felt more than a little frightened of her. Phoenix: (I guess some people just inspire THAT much fear in others...) Athena: Mr. Wright, you were thinking something mean-spirited and rude, weren't you? Phoenix: Ha ha ha! Of course not! (Must beef up mindreading defenses...) Fulbright: Now do you understand?! The very fact that I'm afraid of the moon rock proves that...Fulbright: In fact, I'm on the side of... JUSTICE!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: After all that you've done, how dare you speak the word \"justice\"?! Fulbright: In justice we trust! I'll say it as much as I want, and with absolute confidence! What I say is just, is just! That's how it works in this dark age of the law! Phoenix: (Grr! He won't get the best of me with that twisted argument of his! I'll find a way to get him right where I want him!)Athena: Detective Fulbright, or rather, the phantom, feels fear in regard to the moon rock. It probably has something to do with being afraid that his true identity will be revealed.Phoenix: Right. So that's why the phantom had to take the moon rock with him seven years ago. (In that case, if we had something to show the real cause of Fulbright's fear... ...we just might be able to expose his true identity!)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Athena Cykes\nDescription: A new lawyer at the agency.

    "cot": "Evidence 18 (Lighter) states: \"It has Athena's prints on it in the victim's blood. A lighter that can transform into a handgun. It has Clay Terran's fingerprints and blood on it.\"\n\nTestimony 3 by Fulbright is: \"So the very fact that I'm afraid of the moon rock means I'm not him!\"\n\nHowever, the actual contradiction pointed out in the interactive testimony and evidence is regarding the authenticity of the lighter's fingerprints.\n\nSpecifically, Fulbright claims the prints on the lighter belong to Athena and uses it as decisive proof of her guilt. But later, it is revealed that the fingerprints on the lighter are actually those of the victim, Clay Terran (Evidence 18 is updated to show this). Moreover, testimony 3 by Fulbright is part of his denial of being the phantom, claiming his fear of the moon rock means he isn't the phantom — while evidence and other testimonials (e.g., the psych profile) suggest otherwise.\n\nBut the most direct contradiction clearly outlined in the narrative is between:\n\nEvidence 18: The lighter has Athena's prints on it in the victim's blood.\n\nand\n\nTestimony 3: Fulbright claiming \"So the very fact that I'm afraid of the moon rock means I'm not him!\"\n\nWait, this is not a direct contradiction between evidence and testimony.\n\nAnother contradiction is between:\n\nEvidence 18: The lighter has Athena's prints on it in the victim's blood.\n\nand the later revelation that the prints on the lighter do not belong to Athena but to Clay Terran (the victim).\n\nTestimonies by Fulbright claiming the prints are Athena's serve to incriminate her.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between:\n\nEvidence 18 (showing the lighter with Athena's prints) and\n\nTestimony 3 (Fulbright asserting that the prints are Athena's and that she is the culprit).\n\nHence confirming the lighter's ownership and the prints are contradicted.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 18 and Fulbright's testimony claiming the prints belong to Athena.\n",

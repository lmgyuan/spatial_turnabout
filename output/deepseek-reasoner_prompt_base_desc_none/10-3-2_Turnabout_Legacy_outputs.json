    "cot": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies, and we need to find a pair where the evidence directly contradicts a testimony.\n\nFirst, let's look at the testimonies. There are two from von Karma. Testimony 0 asks about Gusto and Frost's relationship, and Testimony 1 states that their only relationship was participating in the same contest. So von Karma is claiming that Gusto and Frost didn't have any connection beyond being in the same contest.\n\nNow, I need to check the evidences to see if any of them provide information that contradicts this. Let's scan through the evidence list. \n\nLooking at Evidence 19: IS-7 Incident Case File. If the IS-7 incident involved both Gusto and Frost, that might indicate a prior connection beyond just the contest. Alternatively, Evidence 17 or 29 (Family Photo) might show a familial relationship, but the names don't match Gusto and Frost. Evidence 34: Gemini Case Analysis Results\u2014maybe that's related to a previous case involving them. Alternatively, Evidence 14: Semifinal Entries could show that they were competitors in the same contest, but that would support the testimony, not contradict it.\n\nWait, let me check again. Testimony 1 says their only relationship was participating in the same contest. If there's evidence showing they had another relationship, like being involved in a prior incident together (like IS-7), that would contradict the testimony. So if Evidence 19 (IS-7 Incident Case File) mentions both Gusto and Frost as involved, that would mean they had a prior connection beyond the contest, thus contradicting von Karma's testimony. That seems plausible. Let me confirm.\n\nYes, if the IS-7 case file (Evidence 19) includes both Carmelo Gusto (Character 5) and Artie Frost (Character 2), then that would show they had a prior relationship, contradicting von Karma's testimony that their only link was the contest. Therefore, Evidence 19 contradicts Testimony 1."

    "cot": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. Let me start by going through each testimony and cross-referencing them with the evidence to find contradictions.\n\nFirst, looking at the testimonies. All four testimonies are from von Karma. Testimony 0 says he'll tell about Gusto and Frost's connection. Testimony 1 mentions that Gusto told him about their connection during an interrogation. Testimony 2 states that they worked together until the day before the finals. Testimony 3 explains why they cooperated\u2014Gusto had poor design sense, Frost was a baking novice. Testimony 4 says their cooperation ended after semifinals, and they were on their own for finals.\n\nNow, looking at the evidence. Let me check each one. There's Evidence 14: Semifinal Entries. If von Karma says they worked together through semifinals, but the Semifinal Entries might indicate individual entries. Wait, but the testimony says they worked together until the day before finals, which was during semifinals. Wait, semifinals entries would be when they collaborated. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe there's evidence that shows they were working together in the finals, which would contradict Testimony 4. Let me check other evidences.\n\nWait, Evidence 14 is Semifinal Entries. If their cooperation lasted through semifinals (as per Testimony 4), then the Semifinal Entries would be their joint work. But maybe the Semifinal Entries are individual entries? Wait, Testimony 2 says until the day before finals, they worked together. But the finals are separate. So if the Semifinal Entries are joint, that aligns with Testimony 2 and 4. Maybe not a contradiction here.\n\nLooking for other evidence. Evidence 8: Fake Confections. Maybe that's related to their collaboration? Not sure. Evidence 15 and 26: Ultimate Cookbook. Maybe that's a recipe they used together? Not sure. Evidence 35: Chocolates. Maybe Gusto or Frost made chocolates individually, conflicting with collaboration?\n\nWait, Testimony 4 says that for the finals, they were on their own. So if there's evidence that they worked together during the finals, that would contradict. Let's see. Evidence 14 is Semifinal Entries, which would be when they worked together. If the finals required individual entries, then Evidence 14 supports the testimony. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the contradiction is elsewhere. Let me check Testimony 3: They cooperated because Gusto had poor design sense and Frost was a novice at baking. If there's evidence that one of them is actually skilled in that area, that would contradict. For example, if Evidence 15 (Ultimate Cookbook) is linked to Frost, indicating he's a good baker, which would contradict Testimony 3's claim that Frost was a novice. Wait, but the cookbook's name is \"Ultimate Cookbook,\" but who does it belong to? The evidence list has two entries for Ultimate Cookbook: 15 and 26. Maybe if the cookbook is found in Frost's possession, that would suggest he's more skilled than a novice.\n\nLooking at the evidence details: Evidence 15: Ultimate Cookbook. Evidence 26: Ultimate Cookbook again. Maybe duplicate entries? Wait, perhaps they're different instances. Let me check the characters again. Artie Frost is character 2. If Evidence 12 is Mr. Frost's Room, maybe the cookbook is there. If the cookbook in Frost's room (Evidence 12) is Evidence 15 or 26, that would imply he's using an advanced cookbook, contradicting the claim he's a novice baker. So if von Karma says Frost was a novice at baking, but in Frost's room (Evidence 12), there's an Ultimate Cookbook (Evidence 15/26), that would be a contradiction. Let me check the testimonies again.\n\nTestimony 3: \"Why? Because Gusto had poor design sense, and Frost was a novice at baking.\" So if Frost is a novice, but has the Ultimate Cookbook, which is a high-level resource, that could be a contradiction. Because a novice might not need an advanced cookbook. Alternatively, maybe the cookbook is for design, but no, the cookbook is about baking. So if Frost is a novice, but has the Ultimate Cookbook, that suggests he's more advanced, which contradicts Testimony 3.\n\nWait, but Evidence 15 and 26 are both named Ultimate Cookbook. Let me check their numbers again. Evidence 15: Ultimate Cookbook. Evidence 26: Ultimate Cookbook again. Maybe duplicates, perhaps a mistake, but maybe different versions. For example, maybe one is in Frost's room (Evidence 12: Mr. Frost's Room) and another elsewhere. If Frost's room has the cookbook, that would be a point against him being a novice.\n\nSo the contradiction would be between Testimony 3 (Frost is a novice at baking) and Evidence 15/26 (Ultimate Cookbook) found in his room (Evidence 12). But how do the evidence numbers correspond? Wait, the user provided Evidence 12 as \"Mr. Frost's Room.\" So if Evidence 12 is a room where the cookbook is present, then perhaps Evidence 15 is in there. But the list shows Evidence 15: Ultimate Cookbook. So if the cookbook is in Frost's room, then that's Evidence 15 linked to Frost. Thus, Testimony 3's claim that Frost is a baking novice contradicts the presence of an advanced cookbook in his room.\n\nTherefore, the evidence would be 15 (Ultimate Cookbook) and testimony 3. But let me check the evidence list again. Wait, Evidence 15 is Ultimate Cookbook, and Evidence 26 is also Ultimate Cookbook. Maybe they are different entries. If Evidence 26 is in someone else's possession, but if Frost's room (Evidence 12) has Evidence 15, that's his. So that would be the contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another angle. Let's see Testimony 4: Their cooperation lasted through the semifinals. For the finals, they were on their own. But if there's evidence that their entries for the semifinals were individual, that would contradict. For example, Evidence 14: Semifinal Entries. If the semifinal entries are individual, but Testimony 2 and 4 say they worked together until semifinals, that's a contradiction. So if the Semifinal Entries (Evidence 14) are individual entries, then Testimony 2 and 4 would be contradicted. But the testimonies say they worked together until the day before the finals (which was during the semifinals). So if semifinal entries are joint, that's okay, but if they're individual, that's a problem.\n\nBut how do we know if the semifinal entries are individual or joint? The testimony says they worked together until the day before the finals. The finals would require their own entries, but the semifinals entries would be their joint work. So if Evidence 14: Semifinal Entries are individual entries, that contradicts. But without more info on Evidence 14's description, it's hard to tell. But the user only provided the evidence names, not descriptions. So maybe this line of thought is uncertain.\n\nAlternatively, another testimony and evidence pair. Let's check Testimony 3 again. It says Gusto had poor design sense, and Frost was a novice at baking. If there's evidence showing Gusto has good design sense or Frost is a good baker. For example, if there's a Pisces Statue Sketch (Evidence 22) linked to Gusto, showing he has design skills. Or perhaps the Luminous Cloth (Evidence 9 or 24) related to design. Alternatively, the Fake Confections (Evidence 8) might be about design. If Gusto made fake confections that look good, that would show he has design sense, contradicting Testimony 3.\n\nAlternatively, look at Evidence 8: Fake Confections. If Gusto created fake confections that are well-designed, that contradicts Testimony 3's claim of poor design sense. But how do I link Evidence 8 to Gusto? The evidence list doesn't specify ownership. Unless there's another evidence that links it. For example, if Fake Confections were found in Gusto's possession, then that would be a contradiction. But without that info, maybe it's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Ultimate Cookbook (Evidence 15/26) in Frost's room (Evidence 12) shows he's a skilled baker, contradicting Testimony 3. So the pair would be Evidence 15 and Testimony 3. But need to check the numbers. Evidence 15 is \"Ultimate Cookbook\", and Testimony 3 is the one about Frost being a novice. So {\"evidence\": 15, \"testimony\": 3}.\n\nAlternatively, another possibility: Testimony 4 states that they were on their own for the finals. If there's evidence that they worked together during the finals, that would contradict. For example, if the Ultimate Cookbook (Evidence 15/26) is a joint effort. But without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 35: Chocolates. If the chocolates are part of the finals entry and they were made by both, contradicting Testimony 4. But again, unclear.\n\nHmm. Let me think again. The strongest contradiction seems to be between Testimony 3 (Frost is a baking novice) and Evidence 15 (Ultimate Cookbook) in his room. Because having a high-level cookbook would suggest he's not a novice. So the pair would be evidence 15 and testimony 3.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 26 is also Ultimate Cookbook. Wait, maybe Evidence 26 is the same as 15 but listed twice. But the user listed them as separate entries. Maybe that's a typo, but according to the list, they are separate. Maybe they are different copies. If one is in Frost's room and another elsewhere. But the user hasn't specified which evidence is where. So perhaps I should consider that having the Ultimate Cookbook (any of them) as evidence would contradict the claim that Frost is a novice.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is different. Let's check the testimonies again. Testimony 2: \"Until the day before the finals, they worked on their desserts together.\" So the day before finals, they were still working together. But Testimony 4: \"Their cooperation lasted only through the semifinals. For the finals, they were on their own.\" Wait, there might be a contradiction between Testimony 2 and Testimony 4. But the user is asking for evidence and testimony contradiction, not between testimonies.\n\nWait, no. The user wants an evidence and testimony that contradict each other. So I need to find an evidence that directly contradicts a testimony.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 14: Semifinal Entries. If the semifinal entries are individual, then Testimony 2 and 4 would be contradicted. But if the semifinal entries are joint, then it supports the testimony. Without more info on Evidence 14's content, it's hard to say. So maybe this isn't the right approach.\n\nAnother angle: Evidence 3 is Mr. Tangaroa's Teapot. Testimony 0-4 are about Gusto and Frost's cooperation. Not sure.\n\nWait, Evidence 8: Fake Confections. If these are fake desserts made by Gusto, but if Testimony 3 says he has poor design sense, but the fake confections are well-designed, that's a contradiction. But again, how do we know who made them?\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 5 and 27: Frame Finger Marks. Maybe someone's fingerprints on a frame that contradict a testimony about their whereabouts. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 23: Used Blowtorch. Maybe linked to baking, but not sure.\n\nHmm. I think the best bet is the Ultimate Cookbook in Frost's possession contradicting Testimony 3. Let me check the evidence list again. Evidence 12: Mr. Frost's Room. If in his room, there's Evidence 15: Ultimate Cookbook, then that suggests he's using an advanced cookbook, hence not a novice. So the contradiction is between Testimony 3 (Frost is a novice) and Evidence 15 (Ultimate Cookbook in his room). Therefore, {\"evidence\": 15, \"testimony\": 3}.\n\nBut wait, the user lists Evidence 12 as \"Mr. Frost's Room\" and Evidence 15 as \"Ultimate Cookbook\". Unless Evidence 12's description includes the cookbook, but the user hasn't given descriptions. So maybe the connection is that the cookbook is found in his room. But how is that indicated? The user hasn't specified which evidence is associated with whom except by name. For example, Evidence 3 is Mr. Tangaroa's Teapot, so that's linked to Character 1. Similarly, Evidence 12 is Mr. Frost's Room, which is linked to Character 2. So if in his room (Evidence 12) there's the Ultimate Cookbook (Evidence 15), but Evidence 12 is a separate entry. Wait, but the evidence list includes Evidence 12 as \"Mr. Frost's Room\", which is a location, and Evidence 15 is a separate item. Unless the room's contents are part of the evidence. But according to the given data, each evidence is a separate entry. So Evidence 12 is the room itself, and Evidence 15 is the cookbook. So unless the cookbook is in his room, which is implied by being in his room's evidence, but the user hasn't explicitly stated that. So maybe the assistant can't assume that Evidence 15 is in Evidence 12. So that connection might not be valid.\n\nTherefore, maybe this line of reasoning is incorrect.\n\nAnother approach: Looking for duplicates in evidence. For example, Evidence 5 and 27 are both Frame Finger Marks. Evidence 24 and 9 are Luminous Cloth. Maybe these duplicates are significant. For instance, if one of the Frame Finger Marks is from a different person than claimed. But how does that relate to testimonies?\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 4 says they worked together through semifinals. If there's evidence that they submitted a joint entry in the finals, that would contradict. But Evidence 14 is Semifinal Entries. If the semifinal entries are individual, that contradicts. But without knowing, this is speculative.\n\nWait, the user might expect the contradiction between Testimony 4 and Evidence 14. Let me think. Testimony 4 states that they cooperated through semifinals, implying their semifinal entries were joint. But if Evidence 14 (Semifinal Entries) shows individual entries, that's a contradiction. So if the evidence indicates that the semifinal entries were individual, then Testimony 4's claim that they cooperated through semifinals is contradicted. So the pair would be Evidence 14 and Testimony 4. But how do we know the Semifinal Entries are individual? The user only provides the evidence name. Maybe in the context of the game, Semifinal Entries being individual would contradict the testimony. However, without more context, it's a bit of a stretch, but this might be the intended answer.\n\nAlternatively, the correct answer is Evidence 14 and Testimony 4. Because if the semifinal entries are individual, then their cooperation during semifinals is a lie. But the testimony says they worked together until the day before finals (which is during semifinals). If the entries are joint, then it's okay. If they are individual, then contradiction. But how can we know? Maybe in the game's context, the Semifinal Entries are individual, which would contradict the testimony. Alternatively, maybe the cooperation was in preparing for the semifinals, but the actual entries were separate. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, another possible pair: Testimony 2 says they worked together until the day before finals, which was during the semifinals. Evidence 14: Semifinal Entries. If the entries are joint, it's fine. If they are individual, contradiction. But again, without info on Evidence 14's content, this is speculative.\n\nHmm. Given the options, I think the most logical contradiction is between Testimony 3 (Frost is a novice baker) and the Ultimate Cookbook (Evidence 15 or 26) being in his possession, which suggests he's advanced. But how is the cookbook linked to him? If Evidence 26 is the same as 15, perhaps duplicate. The user might have intended this. Alternatively, if the cookbook is in his room (Evidence 12), but Evidence 12 is the room itself, not the cookbook.\n\nAlternatively, the answer could be Evidence 14 and Testimony 2. If the semifinal entries are individual, but Testimony 2 says they worked together until the day before finals. But I'm not certain.\n\nWait, the user is from the Ace Attorney fandom, perhaps. Manfred von Karma's testimony is about Gusto and Frost's cooperation. The contradiction might relate to the fact that the cooperation continued into the finals. Wait, Testimony 4 says their cooperation lasted through semifinals, finals on their own. But if there's evidence that they worked together during the finals, that's a contradiction. For example, Evidence 8: Fake Confections. If those were made jointly during finals, contradicting Testimony 4. But without knowing when the Fake Confections were made, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 35: Chocolates. If these chocolates were part of the finals entry made jointly, contradicting Testimony 4. But again, not clear.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 3: Mr. Tangaroa's Teapot. Not sure.\n\nWait, another angle. Testimony 3 says Gusto had poor design sense. If there's evidence showing Gusto's good design skills. For example, Evidence 22: Pisces Statue Sketch. If that's Gusto's sketch, showing good design, contradicts Testimony 3. So Evidence 22 and Testimony 3. But how do I link the sketch to Gusto? The evidence is named Pisces Statue Sketch. Unless Gusto is known for that. Alternatively, the sketch is by Larry (Laurice Deauxnim is Larry's alias), but Evidence 33 is Larry's Sketches. But if Evidence 22 is a sketch related to the case, maybe it's Gusto's, indicating good design. That would contradict Testimony 3. So {\"evidence\":22, \"testimony\":3}.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this is the case. If the sketch shows a well-designed statue, and it's linked to Gusto, then his design sense is good. But without more info, it's a stretch.\n\nGiven all these possibilities, I need to pick the most likely answer based on typical Ace Attorney contradictions. In the games, often a testimony about someone's lack of skill is contradicted by evidence showing their expertise. So if Frost is supposed to be a novice baker but has the Ultimate Cookbook, that's a common contradiction. Therefore, the answer is Evidence 15 (Ultimate Cookbook) and Testimony 3."

    "cot": "Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. So, first, I need to look through the testimonies and the evidence list to find any inconsistencies.\n\nLooking at the testimonies, Kate mentions in Testimony 4 that she prepared replicas of the sculptures in the Winter Palace based on the photos she took. The key point here is that she used photos to create the replicas. Now, checking the evidence list, Evidence 21 is the Winter Wing Photo. If Kate used her own photos to make the replicas, but the evidence shows there's a Winter Wing Photo, that could mean she's referring to a specific photo that's already in evidence. Wait, but maybe there's a contradiction here. If the replicas were based on her own photos, but the evidence might suggest that the photo (Evidence 21) wasn't taken by her or there's something inconsistent about it. Alternatively, maybe the existence of the photo as evidence contradicts her claim that she used her own photos. Hmm, but the testimony says \"photos I took,\" and the evidence is a Winter Wing Photo. Unless there's another evidence that suggests she couldn't have taken the photo herself. Wait, but maybe another angle. Let me check other evidences.\n\nEvidence 22 is the Pisces Statue Sketch. If the replicas were based on sketches instead of photos, that would contradict her testimony. Wait, but the testimony says she used photos. If there's a sketch in evidence, maybe that's a contradiction. Wait, but the testimony is about using photos, and if there's a sketch that's part of the evidence, perhaps the method of creating replicas is different from what's stated. For example, if the replicas were actually made using a sketch (Evidence 22) instead of photos (Evidence 21), then that would contradict Testimony 4. So, Testimony 4 claims she used photos, but if there's a sketch (Evidence 22) that was the basis, that's a contradiction. Alternatively, maybe the Winter Wing Photo (21) is a different location or not related to the replicas. Alternatively, maybe the Gallery Pamphlet (20) or other evidence might relate. Wait, let me think again.\n\nTestimony 4: Kate used photos she took to make replicas. Evidence 21 is Winter Wing Photo. If the Winter Wing Photo is part of the evidence, maybe the photo she refers to is this one. But if the photo is of the Winter Palace's sculptures, but the Winter Wing might be a different place, or maybe the photo is not of the sculptures but something else. Alternatively, maybe there's a contradiction in the method. For example, the replicas were made using a sketch (Evidence 22) instead of photos, which would contradict her testimony. So Evidence 22 (Pisces Statue Sketch) and Testimony 4. That would be the pair. Because she says she used photos, but the sketch is evidence that the design was based on a sketch, not her own photos. Alternatively, maybe the Gallery Pamphlet (20) includes information that the replicas were based on existing sketches, not her photos. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the replicas were made using a blowtorch (Evidence 23), but that's unrelated. Another angle: if the replicas are based on photos, but the crime scene notes (Evidence 2) might indicate something different. Wait, not sure. Let me check the exact wording again. Testimony 4 says she prepared replicas based on the photos she took. So the key is that the replicas were made from her own photos. If there's evidence that the replicas were actually based on something else, like a sketch or another source, that would contradict. Evidence 22 is a Pisces Statue Sketch. If the sketch is the original design, and the replicas are supposed to be based on that, but Kate says she used her own photos, that's a contradiction. So the pair would be Testimony 4 and Evidence 22. Alternatively, maybe the Winter Wing Photo (21) is the one she took, but if that's not the case, perhaps there's a contradiction. But the problem is, the evidence list might not have a direct link. Alternatively, maybe Evidence 14 (Semifinal Entries) or something else. Wait, maybe the replicas are of the Winter Palace sculptures, but the photo (21) is of the Winter Wing, which is a different place. If the Winter Wing is not part of the Winter Palace, then using a Winter Wing Photo to replicate Winter Palace sculptures would be a contradiction. But I don't have enough info on the exact nature of each evidence. Alternatively, maybe the existence of a sketch (22) as opposed to a photo. Let me go with Evidence 22 (Pisces Statue Sketch) contradicting Testimony 4 (she used photos). So the answer would be {\"evidence\": 22, \"testimony\": 4}."

    "cot": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. Let's go through them step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the testimonies given by Carmelo Gusto (Testimonies 0 to 5). Let's read each one to see what they're saying.\n\nTestimony 0: He says he cooperated with Sir Frost (Artie Frost) until the finals. He handled flavor, Frost did design. So in the semifinals, they worked together.\n\nTestimony 1: For the finals, he wanted to challenge the master (probably Frost) on his own. So he didn't cooperate in the finals.\n\nTestimony 2: He helped Frost make his entry but made his own alone. So in the finals, Frost's entry was made with Gusto's help, but Gusto's was solo. Wait, but Testimony 0 says they cooperated until the finals. So in the finals, they didn't cooperate. But Testimony 2 says \"I helped Sir Frost make his entry, but I made mine completely on my own.\" Wait, this seems conflicting. Wait, Testimony 2 is about the finals? Because the user's Testimony 4 says \"Aside from not cooperating with Sir Frost, the finals weren't much different from the semifinals.\" So in semifinals, they cooperated; in finals, they didn't. But Testimony 2 says he helped Frost make his entry (for finals?), but made his own alone. That would imply that in the finals, Gusto helped Frost, which contradicts Testimony 4, which says they didn't cooperate in the finals. Wait, let me check again.\n\nTestimony 0: Cooperated until the finals. So semifinals were cooperative. Testimony 4: \"Aside from not cooperating with Sir Frost, the finals weren't much different from the semifinals.\" So in finals, they didn't cooperate. But Testimony 2: \"I helped Sir Frost make his entry, but I made mine completely on my own.\" If Testimony 2 is about the finals, then that's a contradiction because he's saying he helped Frost in the finals, but Testimony 4 says they didn't cooperate. Therefore, Testimony 2 and Testimony 4 could be conflicting, but Testimony 2 is by Gusto and Testimony 4 is also by Gusto. Wait, no, all the testimonies provided here are from Gusto. So perhaps Testimony 2 and Testimony 4 are both from Gusto. Wait, looking at the Testimonies list:\n\nTestimonies 0-5 are all by Gusto. So Testimony 2 says he helped Frost make his entry (which would be in the finals, since the semifinals were cooperative anyway), but Testimony 4 says they didn't cooperate in the finals. Wait, Testimony 4 says \"the finals weren't much different from the semifinals except for not cooperating.\" So in the semifinals, they cooperated. In finals, they didn't. But Testimony 2 says \"I helped Sir Frost make his entry...\" which would imply that in the finals, Gusto helped Frost. That's a contradiction. So Testimony 2 (saying he helped Frost) and Testimony 4 (saying they didn't cooperate in finals) would contradict each other, but both are from Gusto. However, maybe the contradiction is between a testimony and an evidence.\n\nNow, looking at the evidences. Let's check the evidence list for anything related to the cooperation or entries. For example, Evidence 14 is Semifinal Entries. Evidence 15 and 26 are Ultimate Cookbook (maybe duplicated). Evidence 8 is Fake Confections. Evidence 10 and 35 are Chocolates. Evidence 4 is Contest Rules. Hmm.\n\nIf the contest rules (Evidence 4) state that participants must work individually in the finals, then Testimony 2, where Gusto says he helped Frost in the finals, would contradict that. Or, if there's evidence showing that in the finals, Frost's entry was made by someone else, that would contradict Gusto's testimony.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 14 (Semifinal Entries) might indicate that the semifinal entries were collaborative, but the finals required individual work. If the Contest Rules (Evidence 4) state that collaboration is allowed in semifinals but not finals, then Testimony 2 (helping Frost in finals) would contradict Evidence 4. Or perhaps the evidence that shows Frost's entry was made by someone else.\n\nWait, let me check Evidence 14: Semifinal Entries. If that evidence shows that Frost's semifinal entry was co-authored by Gusto, that aligns with Testimony 0. But in the finals, Gusto says he helped Frost (Testimony 2), but according to the rules (Evidence 4), collaboration might not be allowed. So if Evidence 4 (Contest Rules) states that collaboration is prohibited in the finals, then Testimony 2 would contradict that.\n\nSo the contradiction would be between Testimony 2 (Gusto helped Frost in finals) and Evidence 4 (Contest Rules disallowing collaboration in finals). Therefore, the pair would be Evidence 4 and Testimony 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another evidence. Let's check another possibility. Evidence 8: Fake Confections. If that shows that Frost's entry was fake, implying Gusto helped him, but if the rules don't allow that, that could be a contradiction. But perhaps the key is between Testimony 2 (helping Frost in finals) and the contest rules (Evidence 4) stating that collaboration is not allowed in finals. Therefore, the contradiction is Evidence 4 and Testimony 2.\n\nYes, that seems plausible. Therefore, the answer would be {\"evidence\": 4, \"testimony\": 2}."

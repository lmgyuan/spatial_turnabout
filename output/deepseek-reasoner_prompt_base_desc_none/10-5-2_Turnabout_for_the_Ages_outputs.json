    "cot": "Okay, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other here. So, the problem is asking me to look through the given testimonies and evidences and find a pair where the evidence directly contradicts a testimony.\n\nFirst, I need to go through each testimony and see if any of the evidence listed can disprove it. Let's start by looking at the testimonies provided.\n\nTestimony 0 by Lang says that when the president was pushed off the roof, Shaun was waiting at the film lot. The evidence related to Shaun's location might be something like the Security Camera Footage (Evidence 10) or Shaun's Rehearsal Tape (Evidence 12). If the tape shows him somewhere else at the time, that would contradict. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nTestimony 1 is about Shaun being an accomplice and the locks being resolved. The locks are mentioned in Evidence 4 (Movie Set Locks). If the locks were tampered with or there's evidence they couldn't have been resolved by an accomplice, maybe that's a contradiction. Not immediately obvious.\n\nTestimony 2 and 3: Lang says the two hid the president's body, and in Testimony 3, he mentions the monster costume. Then Testimony 4 says there's dirt inside the costume from hiding the body. The evidence related to the monster costume could be the Taurusaurus Head (7), Plushie (8), or the Creature Feature Flyer (3). Wait, Evidence 3 is a flyer for the creature feature, which might be related to the monster costume. Also, Evidence 6 is Monster Footprints. If the monster costume was used to hide the body, but there's evidence that the costume couldn't have been used that way, that would contradict.\n\nWait, Testimony 4 specifically states that there's dirt inside the costume because the body was hidden there. But maybe one of the evidences shows that the costume couldn't have been used to transport the body. For example, if the Taurusaurus Head (Evidence 7) is part of a costume that's too small, or if the Security Camera Footage (10) shows the costume wasn't moved. Alternatively, the Behind-the-Scenes Photo (9) might show the costume in a different state. Or the Crime Scene Notes (5) could indicate something about the body's location conflicting with the costume's dirt.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the Monster Footprints (6). If the footprints are from the costume, but there's evidence that the footprints don't match the costume's design. Hmm.\n\nWait, Testimony 4 says the dirt inside the costume must be from hiding the body. But maybe Evidence 6 (Monster Footprints) shows that the monster was walking around, which would mean the dirt could have been tracked in during movement, not necessarily from hiding the body. But that's a stretch. Alternatively, if the Monster Footprints are found in a location that contradicts where the body was hidden, maybe that's a contradiction. Or maybe the Security Camera Footage (10) shows the costume wasn't used to move the body. \n\nWait, another angle: If there's evidence that the costume couldn't have dirt inside because it was sealed or something. For example, Evidence 4 (Movie Set Locks) might indicate that the costume was locked away, making it impossible to put the body inside. But Testimony 3 and 4 are about the costume having dirt inside from hiding the body. If the Movie Set Locks (4) were in place and the costume was locked, then hiding the body inside would be impossible. That seems like a contradiction. So, if Lang says the body was hidden in the costume (Testimony 3 and 4), but the Movie Set Locks (Evidence 4) indicate that the costume was locked and couldn't be accessed, then that's a direct contradiction. So Evidence 4 (Movie Set Locks) contradicts Testimony 3 or 4. Let me check the exact wording of Testimony 3 and 4.\n\nTestimony 3: \"Inside that monster costume over there...\" (probably implying the body was hidden there). Testimony 4: \"There's dirt inside the costume. It must have gotten there when the body was hidden inside.\" So if the Movie Set Locks (Evidence 4) were in place, then the costume was locked, making it impossible to put the body inside. Therefore, Evidence 4 (Movie Set Locks) would contradict Testimony 3 or 4. Which testimony? Testimony 3 is about hiding the body in the costume, Testimony 4 explains the dirt. The locks being in place would make Testimony 3 impossible. So the pair would be Evidence 4 and Testimony 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another evidence. Let me check. Another possibility: The Security Camera Footage (10) might show that no one accessed the costume, contradicting Testimony 3. But if the footage isn't mentioned in the testimonies, maybe it's not directly linked. Alternatively, the Crime Scene Notes (5) might mention that the costume was undisturbed. But I think the most direct contradiction is between the locks (Evidence 4) and the testimony that the body was hidden in the costume. If the locks were in place, then the costume couldn't have been accessed, so the body couldn't have been hidden there. Therefore, Evidence 4 (Movie Set Locks) contradicts Testimony 3 (which claims the body was hidden in the costume). So the answer would be {\"evidence\": 4, \"testimony\": 3}."

Let's start by looking through the testimonies and see if any of them have statements that don't align with the provided evidence.\n\nFirst, let's list out the testimonies by Shaun. Testimony 0 to 7. The main points are:\n\n- Shaun was setting up equipment on the roof and used a heater (Testimony 0).\n- He forgot to turn off the heater when he went down to practice (Testimony 1).\n- He left the film lot after his mom called (Testimony 2).\n- When he came back, the Moozilla's head (Taurusaurus Head?) had fallen, and the president (probably Eustace Winner, character 10) was dead next to it (Testimonies 3-5).\n- He notes there was no blood and the clothes were spotless (Testimony 6), but the president wasn't breathing (Testimony 7).\n\nNow, looking at the evidence list. Let's see if any evidence contradicts these statements. \n\nEvidence 24 is Mr. Aldown's Autopsy Report. Wait, Mr. Aldown is character 20. The victim here is the president, who is Eustace Winner (character 10). Maybe that's a red herring. Let's check other evidence.\n\nEvidence 26 is a Bloody Button. If Shaun says there was no blood, but there's a Bloody Button found, that contradicts Testimony 6 where he claims there was no blood. The Bloody Button would indicate that there was blood present, which Shaun didn't notice or mention. \n\nSo, the contradiction would be between Testimony 6 (Shaun stating no blood) and Evidence 26 (Bloody Button). That seems like a solid contradiction because if there's a bloody button, there must have been some blood at the scene, which Shaun claims wasn't there. Therefore, the evidence 26 contradicts testimony 6."

    "cot": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The characters, evidences, and testimonies are all given. Let's start by looking at the testimonies provided, especially those from Kanis (Character 18), since all the testimonies listed are from him.\n\nTestimony 0: Kanis says he continued correspondence with a young acolyte even after entering prison. He mentions writing letters in braille as a pastime (Testimony 4). So he's been writing braille letters while in prison.\n\nNow, looking at the evidences, there's Evidence 18: Bug. If there's a bug involved, maybe it's related to surveillance or listening devices. But how does that connect? Wait, maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.\n\nTestimony 3: Kanis says he absconded briefly from the prison. But if he was in prison, how could he leave? Unless there's evidence that shows he couldn't have escaped. Wait, maybe there's evidence that he was still in prison, or that his escape wasn't possible.\n\nLooking at Evidence 15: IS-7 Incident Case File. Not sure. Evidence 18 is Bug. Wait, Evidence 17: Knight's Possessions. Hmm. Or Evidence 4: Movie Set Locks. Not sure.\n\nWait, Kanis said he absconded (left) the prison. But if there's evidence that he couldn't have left, like security footage (Evidence 10) showing him still there, but that's not listed. Alternatively, maybe the prison has locks (Evidence 4: Movie Set Locks?) but that's about a movie set. Wait, maybe the Bug (Evidence 18) is a listening device. If Kanis was under surveillance via a bug, then his escape would have been noticed, contradicting his testimony that he left. But how does that directly contradict?\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 3 says he absconded, but Evidence 18 (Bug) might indicate that his movements were monitored, making it impossible for him to leave without detection. Therefore, if there's a bug planted in his cell or on him, the authorities would know if he left, which contradicts his claim of escaping.\n\nWait, but the user is asking for a pair where the evidence and testimony directly contradict. So, if the testimony is that he left prison, but the evidence shows he was under surveillance (Bug), which would have recorded his absence, thus proving he couldn't have left without being noticed. Therefore, the existence of the Bug (Evidence 18) contradicts his Testimony 3 about absconding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another angle. Let's check other testimonies. Testimony 4 says he writes braille letters as a pastime. If there's evidence that contradicts his ability to write braille, but I don't see such evidence. The Forged Letter (Evidence 1) could be related, but not directly. The Braille letters would require him to have the tools, but maybe the Bug (Evidence 18) was found in his cell, which would mean that his activities were monitored, and thus escaping would be detected. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, Testimony 3: He says he absconded from prison. If there's evidence that he was in prison at the time he claims to have left, like Security Camera Footage (Evidence 10) showing him present, but Evidence 10 is about the security camera footage, but we don't know the content. Alternatively, Evidence 4: Movie Set Locks. If the prison has secure locks, maybe he couldn't escape. But Evidence 4 is about Movie Set Locks, which might be a different location.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 15: IS-7 Incident Case File. If that case file relates to Kanis's imprisonment, maybe it shows he was securely held, making his escape impossible. But this is speculative.\n\nAnother angle: Testimony 4 says he writes letters in braille. If there's evidence that the letters were forged (Evidence 1: Forged Letter), then maybe his testimony about writing them is contradicted. But the Forged Letter's content isn't specified. However, if the forged letter is supposed to be from him, but he's writing in braille, then a forged letter in standard text would be a contradiction. But this is a stretch.\n\nWait, Testimony 3 is about him escaping prison. If there's evidence that he couldn't have done that, maybe the security measures in place. For example, Evidence 4: Movie Set Locks. If the prison has locks that were part of the movie set (maybe the prison is a set?), but that's unclear. Alternatively, the Taurusaurus Head (Evidence 7) or other items might not relate.\n\nAlternatively, the Bug (Evidence 18) could have been used to monitor him, so if he escaped, the bug would have recorded that. But if the bug's data shows he never left, that contradicts his testimony. Therefore, Evidence 18 and Testimony 3 contradict each other.\n\nI think that's the most plausible pair. So the answer would be evidence 18 (Bug) and testimony 3 (absconded from prison), as the bug would have recorded his presence, making his escape impossible without detection."

    "cot": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let's start by reviewing the given testimonies and evidences.\n\nThe testimonies are all from Simeon Saint (Character 13). Let's look at each one:\n\nTestimony 0: He practiced with the balloon two nights ago.\nTestimony 1: The last time he took the truck and balloon out was two days ago.\nTestimony 2: The photo (probably Evidence 9: Behind-the-Scenes Photo) was taken when the balloon passed near the building (maybe Evidence 2: Bigg Building).\nTestimony 3: He often flies around that area for advertising.\nTestimony 4: Asks if there's nothing unusual about that.\n\nNow, looking at the evidences. Let's see which ones might relate to Simeon's statements. Evidence 10 is Security Camera Footage. If the footage shows something different from his testimonies, that could be a contradiction. For example, if the security footage shows the balloon or truck being used at a different time than he claims.\n\nEvidence 13 is Blue Truck. Simeon mentions taking the truck out two days ago. If another evidence, like the security footage (Evidence 10) shows the truck being used more recently, that would contradict Testimony 1.\n\nWait, Testimony 1 says the last time he took the truck and balloon was two days ago. But if the security camera footage (Evidence 10) shows the truck or balloon being used more recently, that would contradict his statement. But is there any evidence that indicates that?\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 9 is the Behind-the-Scenes Photo, which Simeon refers to in Testimony 2. If the photo shows something inconsistent with his account, like the balloon not being near the building when he said it was, but maybe the photo's timestamp or location doesn't match.\n\nAnother angle: Testimony 3 says he often flies around that area (Bigg Building?) for advertising. If there's evidence that contradicts the purpose or frequency of his flights. Evidence 3 is Creature Feature Flyer, which might be related to advertising. But how does that tie in?\n\nWait, Evidence 10: Security Camera Footage. If the footage shows that the balloon wasn't there when Simeon claims he flew it, that would contradict. For example, if he said he flew it two days ago (Testimony 1) but the security footage from two days ago doesn't show the balloon, that's a contradiction. But how do we know the time frame of the security footage?\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 2 says the photo (Evidence 9) was taken when the balloon passed near the building. If Evidence 9 shows the balloon in a different location or time than he claims, that would be a contradiction. But maybe the Security Camera Footage (Evidence 10) shows that the balloon wasn't near the building when he said it was. For example, if Simeon claims in Testimony 2 that the photo was taken when the balloon was near the building, but the security footage (Evidence 10) from that time doesn't show the balloon there, that's a contradiction.\n\nLooking at the testimonies again, Testimony 3 says he often flies around that area for advertising. If Security Camera Footage (Evidence 10) shows that there's no such activity, that contradicts. But maybe the security footage from a specific time when he claimed to be there shows something else.\n\nAlternatively, the Forged Letter (Evidence 1) might relate to a fake document that contradicts his statements. But not sure.\n\nWait, let's cross-reference. Simeon's Testimony 1 says the last time he took the truck and balloon out was two days ago. If there's evidence that the truck or balloon was used more recently, that would contradict. Evidence 13 is Blue Truck, which might be the truck in question. If, say, the Blue Truck was found at the crime scene or used recently, but he claims the last time was two days ago, that's a contradiction. But how would we know? Maybe the Security Camera Footage (Evidence 10) shows the truck being used on a different day.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 26 is a Bloody Button, which might link to someone else. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the Crime Scene Notes (Evidence 5) or the Autopsy Report (Evidence 24) could indicate a time of death that conflicts with his alibi. But that's more complex.\n\nAlternatively, the Taurusaurus Head (Evidence 7) or Plushie (8) might relate to a movie set, but not directly.\n\nWait, focusing back on Testimony 1 and Evidence 10. If the Security Camera Footage (10) from, say, yesterday shows the truck or balloon being used, then Simeon's statement that the last time was two days ago would be a lie. So Evidence 10 (Security Camera Footage) would contradict Testimony 1 (last time two days ago).\n\nBut I need to confirm if the Security Camera Footage is timestamped. The user's data doesn't provide details, but perhaps in the context of the case, the Security Camera Footage shows activity on a day after Simeon's claimed last use. For example, if the footage is from one day ago, but Simeon says the last time was two days ago, then it's a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 3 says he often flies around the area for advertising. If the Security Camera Footage (10) shows that he wasn't there when he claimed to be, but that's more about frequency rather than a specific instance.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 2 says the photo (Evidence 9) was taken when the balloon was near the building. If the Security Camera Footage (10) shows that the balloon wasn't there when the photo was taken, that's a contradiction. For example, the photo's timestamp doesn't match the balloon's presence in the security footage.\n\nBut without knowing the exact content of Evidence 9 and 10, I have to make assumptions based on their names. So, perhaps Evidence 10 (Security Camera Footage) contradicts Testimony 3 (flying around the area often). If the security footage shows that he wasn't there as often as he claims, but that's a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 3: \"I often fly around that area for advertising purposes.\" If Evidence 3 is a Creature Feature Flyer, which is an advertisement, maybe the flyer is for a different location or event, contradicting his claim. But not sure.\n\nWait, Evidence 2 is Bigg Building. If Simeon says in Testimony 3 that he flies around the area (Bigg Building) for advertising, but Security Camera Footage (Evidence 10) from the Bigg Building doesn't show his balloon, that's a contradiction. For example, if the security footage from the building's cameras never captured his balloon despite his claim of frequent flights, that would be a contradiction between Testimony 3 and Evidence 10.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 2 says the Behind-the-Scenes Photo (Evidence 9) was taken when the balloon was near the building. If the photo actually shows the balloon not near the building, but somewhere else, that's a contradiction. But how would we know? Maybe the photo shows a different location, and Evidence 2 (Bigg Building) is the location in question.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 10 (Security Camera Footage) could show that the balloon wasn't present at the time the photo (Evidence 9) was supposedly taken, which would contradict Testimony 2.\n\nHmm. The problem says to pick one pair. The most straightforward contradiction might be between Testimony 1 (last used two days ago) and Security Camera Footage (Evidence 10) showing usage more recently. Or Testimony 0 (practiced two nights ago) and Evidence 10 showing that he did it another time.\n\nWait, Testimony 0 says he practiced two nights ago, Testimony 1 says last time was two days ago. Are \"two nights ago\" and \"two days ago\" the same? Depending on the timeline, maybe. But perhaps the Security Footage (Evidence 10) shows him using it more recently than two days ago, contradicting Testimony 1.\n\nAlternatively, if Evidence 10 shows that the truck was used yesterday, which is one day ago, contradicting Testimony 1's claim of two days ago.\n\nI think the most likely contradiction is between Testimony 1 (last time truck and balloon used two days ago) and Evidence 10 (Security Camera Footage showing them used more recently). So the pair would be Evidence 10 and Testimony 1. But let me check the numbering.\n\nTestimony 1 is \"The last time I took the truck and the balloon out was two days ago.\" Person: Simeon.\n\nEvidence 10 is Security Camera Footage. If the footage shows that the truck or balloon was used after the time he claims, that's a contradiction. So the evidence would be 10 and testimony 1. But wait, let me check the evidence numbers again.\n\nEvidence 10: Security Camera Footage.\n\nTestimony 1: index 1.\n\nSo {\"evidence\": 10, \"testimony\": 1}?\n\nAlternatively, maybe another pair.\n\nWait, let's look at Evidence 13: Blue Truck. If the Blue Truck is evidence that was used more recently, but Testimony 1 says the last use was two days ago. But how would the Blue Truck evidence show that? Maybe the truck was found at the crime scene with recent activity. But without more context, perhaps Security Footage is more direct.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 9: Behind-the-Scenes Photo. If the photo's content contradicts Testimony 2, which says the photo was taken when the balloon was near the building. For example, if the photo shows the balloon not near the building, but another location. But again, we don't know the photo's content.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 3: Creature Feature Flyer. If the flyer is for an event that requires the balloon to be present, contradicting his testimony. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: Testimony 0 says he practiced two nights ago. Testimony 1 says last time was two days ago. Depending on the timeline, if \"two nights ago\" is more recent than \"two days ago,\" there's a contradiction. But that's between testimonies, not evidence.\n\nSo, the best contradiction is likely between Testimony 1 (last time two days ago) and Security Camera Footage (Evidence 10) showing the truck/balloon in use after that time. Therefore, the answer should be evidence 10 and testimony 1."

The testimonies in question are all from Simeon Saint, Testimonies 0 to 3. The key here is to find an evidence that directly contradicts what Simeon is saying in one of these testimonies.\n\nLooking at the testimonies:\n\nTestimony 1: Simeon claims there's not a single word about instigating murder in the letter. He says, \"I instigated murder? There's not a single word about that in the letter, is there?\" So he's referring to a letter. Let me check the evidence list for anything related to a letter. Evidence 1 is a Forged Letter. If the Forged Letter contains content about instigating murder, that would directly contradict his statement. Because if the letter he's talking about is the forged one, and it does mention instigation, then his testimony that there's no such word would be a lie. \n\nLooking at the evidence list, Evidence 1 is the Forged Letter. So if that letter indeed has wording that suggests instigation, then Testimony 1 by Simeon is contradicted by Evidence 1. That would be the pair. The Forged Letter (Evidence 1) would show that there was indeed something in the letter about instigating murder, which he's denying in Testimony 1.\n\nOther possibilities: Let me check other testimonies. Testimony 2 and 3 are about whether he used the word \"kill\". But without evidence showing he did, maybe. However, Evidence 1 being a forged letter might relate to the content he's talking about. The key is the word \"letter\" in Testimony 1. Since the forged letter is Evidence 1, if that's the letter he's referring to, and it does contain instigation, that's the contradiction.\n\nSo the pair would be Evidence 1 (Forged Letter) contradicting Testimony 1 where he says the letter doesn't mention instigation."

      "evidence": 4,
      "testimony": 4
    },
    "cot": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user wants just one pair. Let's start by looking at the testimonies provided by Simeon.\n\nTestimony 0 says he was riding the balloon to the rooftop. Then Testimony 1 mentions he saw the body double and Verity Gavelle on the roof. Testimony 2 says only the double noticed him and told Verity to leave. Testimony 3 says the double pointed a gun and fired. Testimony 4 states that after firing one shot, the double went into the 51st floor hatch.\n\nNow, looking at the evidences. Let me check each one to see which could contradict these statements. Evidence 10 is Security Camera Footage. If the security camera footage shows something different from what Simeon is saying, that could be a contradiction. For example, if Simeon claims the double fired a shot and then went into the hatch, but the footage shows the double didn't fire a shot, or perhaps didn't enter the hatch. Alternatively, maybe the footage shows that Verity wasn't on the roof at that time, contradicting Testimony 1.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 9 is the Behind-the-Scenes Photo. Maybe the photo shows the Taurusaurus head (Evidence 7) in a different location than where the crime happened. Wait, but that might not directly relate to the testimonies. Let me think again.\n\nLooking at Testimony 4: After firing one shot, the double entered the hatch to the 51st floor. If the Security Camera Footage (Evidence 10) shows that the double didn't enter the hatch, or that there's no one entering at that time, that would contradict Testimony 4. So Evidence 10 (Security Camera Footage) might show that the double didn't go into the hatch, which would contradict Simeon's statement in Testimony 4.\n\nAnother angle: Evidence 6 is Monster Footprints. If the footprints are in a location that contradicts where Simeon says the double went. But maybe that's a stretch.\n\nWait, let me check Evidence 10's name again. It's Security Camera Footage. If the camera footage from the building (maybe Bigg Building, Evidence 2) shows that after the shot, the double didn't enter the hatch, that would directly contradict Testimony 4. So the contradiction would be between Testimony 4 and Evidence 10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Evidence 4 (Movie Set Locks) indicates that the hatch was locked, making it impossible for the double to enter. If the locks were in place, then Testimony 4's claim that the double entered the hatch would be impossible. But Evidence 4 is about Movie Set Locks. If the locks were engaged, maybe the hatch couldn't be opened. So if Simeon says the double entered the hatch via the locked hatch, but the locks were in place, that's a contradiction. So Evidence 4 (Movie Set Locks) and Testimony 4. But I need to check what the Movie Set Locks exactly are. If the locks were on the hatch, then the double couldn't have entered. So if the locks were secure, the testimony about entering the hatch would be impossible. That could be a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 23 is Fire. If there was a fire that destroyed the hatch, but the testimony says the double entered it. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 5 is Crime Scene Notes. Maybe the notes say something about the hatch being locked from the inside, contradicting the entry.\n\nBut given the options, the most direct contradiction would be between Testimony 4 (double entered the hatch) and Security Camera Footage (Evidence 10) which might show no one entered. Alternatively, if the Movie Set Locks (Evidence 4) indicate that the hatch was locked, making entry impossible, then that contradicts Testimony 4.\n\nSo which one is more likely? Let me think about the case. If the Movie Set Locks (Evidence 4) were in place on the hatch, then the double couldn't have entered. So Simeon's Testimony 4 says he did enter, but the locks were on, meaning he couldn't. That would be a contradiction. Alternatively, the Security Camera Footage might show that no one entered the hatch. But without knowing what exactly the evidence contains, it's a bit tricky. However, the user expects us to pick the pair. Based on typical scenarios, Security Camera Footage often contradicts testimonies about movements. So if Simeon says the double entered the hatch, but the footage doesn't show that, that's a contradiction. Alternatively, if the locks were in place, and the testimony says he entered, that's another contradiction.\n\nLooking at the evidence names again:\n\nEvidence 4: Movie Set Locks. If these locks were secured, then the hatch couldn't be opened. If Testimony 4 says the double entered through the hatch, but the locks were in place (so the hatch was locked), that's a contradiction. So Evidence 4 and Testimony 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Security Camera Footage shows the double entering, but that's not a contradiction. Wait, no. The question is to find a contradiction. So if the testimony says he entered, but the evidence shows he didn't, or vice versa. So if the Security Camera Footage (Evidence 10) shows that the double did not enter the hatch after firing the shot, then Testimony 4 is contradicted. Alternatively, maybe the footage shows that the double was somewhere else at the time.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 9: Behind-the-Scenes Photo. If the photo shows the Taurusaurus head (Evidence 7) in a different location, maybe that's not related. Let's focus on the testimonies and possible evidence that directly relates.\n\nTestimony 4 is about the double entering the 51st floor hatch after firing. If the Movie Set Locks (Evidence 4) were locked, then the hatch couldn't be opened. So that would contradict the testimony. So Evidence 4 and Testimony 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the locks were not on the hatch but elsewhere. But if the evidence is called Movie Set Locks, maybe they're the locks for the set, including the hatch. If those locks were in place, the hatch was locked, so entering is impossible. Therefore, the contradiction would be between Evidence 4 (Movie Set Locks) and Testimony 4 (entered the hatch). So the answer would be {\"evidence\":4, \"testimony\":4}.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Security Camera Footage (Evidence 10) shows that the double didn't go into the hatch. If the footage from the 51st floor hatch area shows no one entered, then that contradicts Testimony 4. So that would be Evidence 10 and Testimony 4.\n\nBut which one is more likely? The problem is that without knowing the exact content of the evidence, we have to infer based on the names. Since the locks (Evidence4) might make entry impossible, while the camera footage (Evidence10) might show lack of entry. Both could be possible. But which one is the intended answer?\n\nAlternatively, let's think about other possibilities. Testimony 3 says the double fired a shot. If there's a Bloody Button (Evidence26) that's linked to someone else, but that's not directly related. Or Evidence21: Sedative. Maybe the sedative was used on someone, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 7: Taurusaurus Head. If the head was part of the costume, maybe the testimony about the double wearing it, but the head is found elsewhere. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 12: Shaun's Rehearsal Tape. If the tape shows Shaun rehearsing at the time of the crime, but the testimony says the double was there. But Shaun is character5, and the testimony is about Verity and the double. Not sure.\n\nHmm. Let's go back to the most straightforward. Testimony 4: After the shot, the double entered the hatch. If the Movie Set Locks (Evidence4) were locked, the hatch couldn't be opened, so entering is impossible. So the evidence would be 4, testimony 4. Alternatively, the Security Camera Footage (10) shows that the hatch wasn't entered. So that's another option.\n\nIf I have to choose between these, which one is more likely? In typical Ace Attorney cases, locks being in place would prevent movement. So if the locks were on, the hatch couldn't be opened, thus the testimony is a lie. So Evidence4 and Testimony4. Alternatively, maybe the security camera footage shows that the double didn't enter, but that's possible too.\n\nBut given that the answer requires only one pair, I think the intended contradiction is between the Security Camera Footage (Evidence10) and Testimony4. For example, the footage might show that the double didn't enter the hatch, contradicting Simeon's claim. So the pair would be Evidence10 and Testimony4.\n\nBut I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe Evidence4 is about the locks, making entry impossible. Let me check. Evidence4's name is \"Movie Set Locks\" \u2013 perhaps the locks were on the doors or hatches of the movie set, preventing access. So if the double entered the hatch, but the locks were in place (meaning the hatch was locked), that's a contradiction. Therefore, Evidence4 and Testimony4 would contradict. So the answer would be {\"evidence\":4, \"testimony\":4}.\n\nAlternatively, if the locks were not engaged, but the camera footage shows something else. It's a bit ambiguous, but based on the names, I think Evidence4 and Testimony4 is a possible pair. However, another possibility is Evidence10 (Security Camera) and Testimony4.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Evidence9: Behind-the-Scenes Photo. If the photo shows the hatch was locked or something, but not sure.\n\nWait, Testimony4 says the double entered the hatch to the 51st floor. If the Movie Set Locks (Evidence4) were in place, that means the hatch was locked from the outside, so the double couldn't have entered. Therefore, this would be a contradiction. So Evidence4 and Testimony4.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be {\"evidence\":4, \"testimony\":4}."

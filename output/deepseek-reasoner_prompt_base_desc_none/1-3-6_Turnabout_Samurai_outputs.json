    "cot": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the task is to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other among the given list. The user wants just one pair, so I need to look through each testimony and cross-check with the evidences provided.\n\nFirst, let me list out the testimonies by Dee Vasquez. There are six testimonies from her (Testimony 0 to 5). Let me go through each one and see if any of them clash with an evidence.\n\nTestimony 0: She entered the trailer a little before noon. Hmm. Any evidence related to time here? Let me check the evidences. Evidence 16 is a Steak Plate. Testimony 5 says she and Sal ate t-bone steaks in front of the trailer. Wait, if they ate steaks, maybe that's connected to the Steak Plate evidence. But how does that contradict?\n\nTestimony 1: The meeting was from 12:00 to 4:00. Testimony 4 mentions a 15-minute break at 2:30. So the meeting was ongoing until 4. Then Testimony 2 says after the meeting ended at 4, they went to Studio One for rehearsal. Testimony 3: She was fatigued and had Sal take her. Maybe the time when she was with Sal?\n\nWait, looking at Testimony 5: They ate steaks on the table in front of the trailer. If the meeting was from 12-4, with a break at 2:30-2:45, when would they have time to eat steaks? The break was 15 minutes. Maybe they ate during the break? But if the meeting ended at 4, and they went to rehearsal, but then Testimony 5 says they ate after that? Or during the meeting?\n\nBut wait, the Steak Plate (Evidence 16) is mentioned. Let me check the evidence list. Evidence 16 is \"Steak Plate\". Testimony 5 says they ate steaks. But if the meeting was from 12 to 4 with a break at 2:30, maybe they ate during the break. But if the meeting was continuous except for the break, then they could have eaten during the break. But maybe there's a contradiction in timing.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Evidence 16: Steak Plate. If the steak plate was found in a place that contradicts when they ate. For example, if the plate was found in the trailer but she claims they ate in front of the trailer. But I don't see evidence location details here.\n\nWait, maybe Testimony 5 says they ate steaks on the table in front of the trailer. If that's the case, then the Steak Plate (Evidence 16) would logically be there. But where is Evidence 16 found? The problem doesn't specify locations of evidences, just their names. So perhaps another angle.\n\nWait, let's check other evidences. Evidence 1 is Powers's Letter, 3 is Jack's Autopsy, 4 is Cardkey, etc. Evidence 7 is Empty Bottle \u2192 Sleeping Pill Bottle. Maybe the autopsy report mentions something about sleeping pills? Let me see. The Autopsy Report (Evidence 3) might state the cause of death. If the autopsy shows death by poisoning via sleeping pills, but the Testimony might claim something else. But I don't have the content of the autopsy report here.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at Testimony 3: She was fatigued, so had Sal take her. Maybe she took sleeping pills (Evidence 7). But if she was fatigued and took pills, but the autopsy report shows the victim (Jack Hammer?) died from something else. Wait, but Jack's Autopsy is Evidence 3. If the testimony says she was with Sal during a certain time, but maybe the evidence shows something conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Testimony 5: They ate steaks. The Steak Plate (16) could have been found with something else. Wait, maybe the Autopsy Report (3) says time of death conflicting with when they were eating. For example, if the steak was eaten at 2:30 during the break, but the time of death was around then. But without exact time of death, hard to say.\n\nWait, maybe Testimony 4: Break from 2:30-2:45. Testimony 5: Ate steaks during that break. But the Steak Plate (16) could have been found with something that shows it was from a different time. Wait, maybe the script (Evidence 10) or something else contradicts the timeline.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider Evidence 5: Powers'(?) Photo. Maybe the photo shows something related to the meeting time. For example, if the photo is timestamped at a time when Vasquez was supposed to be in the meeting, but she's in the photo elsewhere. But without knowing the photo's content, this is speculative.\n\nWait, another angle. Testimony 1: Meeting from 12-4. Testimony 5: Eating steak during the meeting, perhaps during the break. But if Evidence 16 (Steak Plate) was found in a location that contradicts where they were supposed to be. For example, if the plate was in Studio One, but they were in front of the trailer. But again, the problem doesn't specify evidence locations.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Testimony 0: She entered the trailer before noon. Evidence 8 is Trailer Key. If the Trailer Key was found elsewhere, indicating someone else had access. But not sure.\n\nWait, maybe Testimony 5 says they ate steaks, but Evidence 16 (Steak Plate) might have remnants that show more than two people ate, contradicting her statement that only her and Sal ate. But again, the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 3: She was fatigued, had Sal take her. If Evidence 7 is Sleeping Pill Bottle, maybe she took pills, making her unable to be present somewhere. But how does that contradict?\n\nWait, let's think of the timeline. The meeting was from 12-4, with a break 2:30-2:45. She says in Testimony 5 that during the break, they ate steaks. But perhaps the autopsy report (Evidence 3) states that the time of death was around 2:30, which would mean that someone (Jack Hammer?) died at that time, but Vasquez claims she was eating then, providing an alibi. But if the autopsy contradicts the time, that's a contradiction. However, the user hasn't given the content of the autopsy report, so maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, another approach. Let's look for a direct contradiction between a testimony and an evidence. For example, if a testimony claims something that an evidence directly shows is false. For instance, a testimony saying \"I was not at the scene\" but an evidence places them there. But the given data is limited.\n\nWait, looking at Testimony 2: After the meeting ended at 4, they went to Studio One for rehearsal. But maybe Evidence 10 (Script) indicates that the rehearsal was supposed to be at a different time, or another evidence contradicts the movement. Or Evidence 8 (Trailer Key) might indicate that someone else accessed the trailer during that time.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 9 is Vasquez's Memo. If the memo has a note that contradicts her testimony. But again, without the memo's content, hard to tell.\n\nWait, maybe Testimony 0: Entered the trailer before noon. Evidence 8 is the Trailer Key. If the key was needed to enter, but someone else had it. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the meeting timing. Testimony 1 says the meeting was from 12:00 to 4:00. Testimony 4 says they took a break at 2:30 for 15 minutes. So the meeting resumed at 2:45 and went until 4. Then Testimony 2 says after the meeting ended at 4, they went to Studio One. But what if an evidence shows that someone was in Studio One during the meeting time? For example, Evidence 10 (Script) might have notes about a rehearsal at a different time. But again, not enough info.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 5: Ate steaks with Sal. If the Steak Plate (16) has fingerprints of someone else, but the problem doesn't mention that.\n\nHmm. Maybe the key contradiction is between Testimony 5 (eating steaks during the break) and Evidence 16 (Steak Plate) showing that the steaks were actually consumed at a different time. Wait, but how? Unless the plate has something indicating a different time. For example, if the plate was found in the trailer, but they claim to have eaten outside. But without location data, I can't confirm.\n\nWait, perhaps the Autopsy Report (3) states the time of death as during the meeting, but Vasquez's testimony provides an alibi. For example, if the murder happened during the meeting when she was in the meeting, but the autopsy says the death occurred at a time when she was elsewhere. But again, without specifics.\n\nAlternatively, the key contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 8. Testimony 3 says she had Sal take her because she was fatigued. If she needed the Trailer Key (8) to get into the trailer, but the key was found elsewhere, implying she couldn't have entered without it. But if she had the key, then no issue. Not sure.\n\nWait, another angle: Evidence 17 is a Five-Year-Old Photo. If that photo shows something relevant to the case, like a past event that contradicts her testimony. But without context, hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 4 is a Cardkey. If the Cardkey logs show her accessing a location at a time she claims to be elsewhere. But again, no info on that.\n\nHmm. Maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 5 (eating steak during the break) and the Autopsy Report (3) if the victim's stomach contents don't show steak, implying they died before eating. But that's a stretch without details.\n\nWait, perhaps Testimony 5 says they ate steaks during the break (2:30-2:45), but the Steak Plate (16) has two plates, but the Autopsy Report shows the victim had not eaten recently, which would contradict if the victim was supposed to be Sal. Wait, but the victim is Jack Hammer (Evidence 3 is Jack's Autopsy). So if Jack died before 2:30, then he couldn't have eaten the steak. But Vasquez says she ate with Sal, not Jack. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Director (Character 7) or someone else's testimony contradicts, but the testimonies given are only from Vasquez.\n\nWait, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 0 and Evidence 8 (Trailer Key). If Vasquez entered the trailer before noon (Testimony 0), but the Trailer Key was found somewhere else, implying she couldn't have entered without it. But maybe she had the key. Unless the key was needed and she didn't have it, but the testimony says she entered.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 5: Ate steaks with Sal. If Sal is another character, maybe he has an alibi that contradicts. But the characters list doesn't have a Sal. Wait, the characters are listed as 0-9, including Dee Vasquez (9). Testimony 5 mentions \"Sal\" but Sal isn't listed as a character here. Maybe Sal is a nickname or another person not listed. But according to the given data, the testimonies are from Vasquez, and the other characters are those listed. So maybe Sal is not a listed character. So perhaps the steak plate (16) has evidence that contradicts the number of people. For example, three plates instead of two. But again, the problem doesn't specify.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Testimony 3: She was fatigued and had Sal take her. If she took sleeping pills (Evidence 7), but then the time of the meeting and her activities would be affected. For example, if she was under the influence of sleeping pills during the meeting, which might affect her ability to attend. But without timing details on when she took them, hard to say.\n\nWait, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 1 (meeting from 12-4) and Evidence 14 (\"Path to Glory\"). If \"Path to Glory\" is a document that schedules the meeting at a different time. But again, no info on Evidence 14's content.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 5: Powers'(?) Photo. If the photo is timestamped during the meeting time, showing Powers somewhere else, which would contradict if he was supposed to be in the meeting. But Vasquez's testimony is about her own actions, not Powers'.\n\nHmm. I'm not finding a clear contradiction here. Maybe I need to look for something else. Wait, let's check all evidence names again.\n\nEvidence 7: Empty Bottle \u2192 Sleeping Pill Bottle. If Vasquez took sleeping pills (Testimony 3 says she was fatigued), but the bottle is empty, implying she took all the pills, which would make her very drowsy. However, she was able to attend the meeting from 12-4, which might be contradictory if the pills would have knocked her out. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, the Empty Bottle (Evidence 7) might have fingerprints of someone else, implying someone else used the pills. But again, not specified.\n\nWait, maybe Testimony 4: Break at 2:30 for 15 minutes. Testimony 5: During the break, ate steak. But the Steak Plate (16) might have been found in a location that requires more time to access, implying they couldn't have eaten during the 15-minute break. But without location details, this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 3: Jack's Autopsy Report. If the report states the time of death as during the meeting, but Vasquez has an alibi (Testimony 5) of being with Sal during the break, which is part of the meeting time. So if the murder happened during the break when she was eating, but she has an alibi, but the autopsy shows the time of death as then. But this would mean there's no contradiction. Wait, unless the autopsy shows that the time of death was at a time when she couldn't have done it. But unless the evidence and testimony directly clash.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at Testimony 2: After the meeting ended at 4, they went to Studio One. Evidence 10: Script. If the script indicates that the rehearsal was supposed to start earlier, contradicting the testimony. For example, the script has a rehearsal time of 3:30, but Vasquez claims they went after 4. But without the script's details, can't confirm.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let's try to find the most likely pair. The most common contradictions in such scenarios are often timeline inconsistencies. \n\nLooking at Testimony 1: Meeting from 12-4. Testimony 4: 15-minute break at 2:30. Testimony 5: Ate steaks during the break (2:30-2:45). If the Steak Plate (Evidence 16) was found in Studio One, but they were supposed to be in front of the trailer. But again, no location data.\n\nWait, another angle: The Empty Bottle \u2192 Sleeping Pill Bottle (Evidence 7). If Vasquez took sleeping pills, causing her to be asleep, but her testimonies claim she was active during the meeting. For example, if the pills would have made her unconscious, but she attended the meeting. That's a contradiction. But how much time passed between taking the pills and the meeting? If she took them before noon, maybe she would be asleep by the meeting. But Testimony 0 says she entered the trailer before noon, maybe to take the pills. But then she was in the meeting from 12-4. So if the pills' effects would have kicked in during the meeting, making her unable to participate, but she did, that's a contradiction. However, this is speculative about the pill's effects.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"Empty Bottle\" (Evidence 7) indicates that all pills were used, suggesting someone took a lethal dose. If the autopsy shows death by overdose, but Vasquez claims the victim was with her. But the victim here is Jack Hammer, maybe.\n\nAlternatively, considering Testimony 5: They ate steak, but the Steak Plate (16) has two plates, but the number of people present differs. But without more info, it's hard.\n\nWait, I think I need to go with the most logical contradiction here. Let me look again.\n\nTestimony 5 says they ate steaks on the table in front of the trailer. Evidence 16 is the Steak Plate. If the plate was found inside the trailer, that contradicts the testimony. But since the problem doesn't specify where evidence was found, this can't be determined. Alternatively, if the plate shows that the steaks were eaten at a different time. For example, if the plate has a time-stamped receipt or something, but again, not mentioned.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 3: She was fatigued, had Sal take her. Evidence 7: Sleeping pills. If she took the pills, which would require her to be asleep, but she attended the meeting. So the contradiction is that she couldn't have been in the meeting if she took the pills. But this depends on the dosage and timing. For example, if she took the pills at 2:30 during the break, maybe she would be drowsy but functional. Not a clear contradiction.\n\nWait, let me think about the timeline again. The meeting starts at 12, ends at 4. Break at 2:30 for 15 minutes. She eats steak during the break. So 2:30-2:45. Then the meeting resumes until 4. Then they go to Studio One. \n\nIf the murder happened during the break, and she has an alibi of eating steak, but evidence shows she was elsewhere. But without knowing the murder time or location, hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Security Lady (Character 4) has security footage showing something, but since there's no testimony from her, maybe not.\n\nWait, another angle: Evidence 4 is the Cardkey. If the cardkey logs show that someone used it to access the trailer at a time when Vasquez claimed to be elsewhere. For example, if she said she was in the meeting, but her cardkey was used to enter the trailer during the meeting. But again, without knowing the evidence details, this is a stretch.\n\nHmm. Given the information provided, the most likely contradiction is between Testimony 5 (eating steak during the break) and Evidence 16 (Steak Plate). But why would that be a contradiction? Unless the plate shows that the steaks were eaten at a different time. Maybe the Steak Plate has a time-stamped receipt or something indicating it was consumed after 4 PM, which would contradict the testimony that they ate during the break (2:30-2:45). But again, this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of steak plates. If there's only one plate, but she claims she and Sal ate. But the evidence is named \"Steak Plate\" (singular), which might imply only one plate was found, contradicting the testimony that two people ate. But in the evidence list, it's \"Steak Plate\" (Evidence 16), which could be a plate with steak remains. If the plate was found with two sets of utensils or something, but the problem doesn't specify.\n\nAlternatively, considering that Testimony 5 says they ate during the break (2:30-2:45), but the Steak Plate (16) was found in a location that was inaccessible during that time. For example, if the plate was in Studio One, but they were in front of the trailer. But again, no location info.\n\nWait, maybe the key contradiction is between Testimony 5 and Evidence 16 in combination with another evidence. But the user asks for one evidence and one testimony.\n\nAlternatively, Evidence 3 (Jack's Autopsy Report) might state the time of death as 2:45 PM, but Vasquez says she was eating steak with Sal until 2:45, providing an alibi. But if the murder required her presence, the autopsy time would contradict her alibi. However, this would require the autopsy report to state the time of death as during the break when she was eating. But unless the evidence directly contradicts the testimony, this is not certain.\n\nGiven the available information, the most plausible contradiction I can think of is between Testimony 5 (Vasquez and Sal eating steak during the break) and Evidence 16 (Steak Plate), if the Steak Plate's presence or condition contradicts the time or location stated in the testimony. However, without more details, this is a bit of a guess.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at Testimony 3: She was fatigued and had Sal take her. If she needed to be somewhere else, but Evidence 8 (Trailer Key) shows she accessed the trailer at that time. But not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 0 and Evidence 8. Testimony 0 says she entered the trailer before noon. Evidence 8 is the Trailer Key. If the key was found in someone else's possession, implying she couldn't have entered. But if she had the key, then no contradiction. Unless the key was required and she didn't have it, but the testimony says she entered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Evidence 5 (Powers'(?) Photo) shows Powers in the trailer at the same time Vasquez entered before noon, implying two people were there. But Vasquez's testimony doesn't mention Powers, which could be a contradiction. But without the photo's content, this is unclear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the information available, I think the most likely answer is that Testimony 5 (eating steak during the break) is contradicted by Evidence 16 (Steak Plate) if the plate's details show it was used at a different time. But since the problem requires one pair, perhaps the intended answer is Evidence 16 and Testimony 5. Alternatively, another pair.\n\nWait, let me check the evidence names again. Evidence 7: Empty Bottle \u2192 Sleeping Pill Bottle. If Vasquez claims she was fatigued (Testimony 3) and took pills, but the bottle is empty, implying she took a lot, which might contradict her ability to attend the meeting. So Testimony 3 and Evidence 7. But Testimony 3 is about being fatigued and having Sal take her, not about taking pills. So if the bottle is empty, maybe she took pills, which made her too drowsy to attend the meeting. But she did attend from 12-4. So if the pills would have made her sleep, but she was in the meeting, that's a contradiction. So that could be the pair: Evidence 7 contradicts Testimony 3.\n\nBut how? Testimony 3 says she was fatigued and had Sal take her. If she took sleeping pills (Evidence 7), she might have been too drowsy to attend the meeting. But she was in the meeting according to Testimony 1. So the contradiction would be that she couldn't have been awake during the meeting if she took the pills. Therefore, Evidence 7 (Sleeping Pill Bottle) contradicts Testimony 3 (fatigued, took by Sal), implying she was under the influence and couldn't have actively participated. So the pair would be Evidence 7 and Testimony 3.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, the autopsy report (Evidence 3) states death by a method that contradicts her alibi. For example, if the murder weapon was the Samurai Spear (Evidence 6), and she claims to be elsewhere. But I don't see a direct link.\n\nAfter considering all possibilities, I think the intended contradiction is between Testimony 5 (eating steaks during the break) and Evidence 16 (Steak Plate), but I'm not entirely certain. However, another possible pair is between Vasquez's Testimony 1 (meeting from 12-4) and Evidence 9 (Vasquez's Memo) if the memo mentions a different meeting time. But again, no info on the memo's content.\n\nAlternatively, the key contradiction might be between Testimony 4 (15-minute break at 2:30) and Evidence 16 (Steak Plate), as eating a steak meal in 15 minutes is unlikely. So the Steak Plate evidence (with a large meal) contradicts the short break time. So Evidence 16 and Testimony 4. That makes sense because a T-bone steak meal typically takes longer than 15 minutes to eat. Therefore, the testimony says they took a 15-minute break and ate steaks during that time, but realistically, that's not enough time, so the Steak Plate contradicts the testimony about the break duration. So the pair would be Evidence 16 and Testimony 4.\n\nYes, that's a plausible contradiction. Eating a T-bone steak would take more than 15 minutes, so the evidence of the steak plate contradicts the testimony that they ate during a 15-minute break."

    "cot": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The characters, evidences, and testimonies are all given. Let's start by going through each testimony and see if any of them clash with the evidence provided.\n\nFirst, looking at the testimonies given by Vasquez. There are seven of them. Let's list them out again to make sure I have them right:\n\nTestimony 0: Vasquez says she was with Sal and Oldbag (Security Lady) when they found the body.\n\nTestimony 1: The assistant was there too, only Powers was absent.\n\nTestimony 2: She called the police, then Powers showed up.\n\nTestimony 3: Oldbag pointed at Powers, accusing him.\n\nTestimony 4: Vasquez asked to be left out of the proceedings.\n\nTestimony 5: She went back to the trailer to get her script and direction notes.\n\nTestimony 6: Then she went home.\n\nTestimony 7: She left the action scenes behind because Hammer was injured.\n\nNow, looking at the evidences. Let's recall some key ones. For example, Evidence 10 is the Script. Evidence 8 is the Trailer Key. Evidence 9 is Vasquez's Memo. Also, Evidence 5 is Powers'(?) Photo. Maybe there's something in the script or the memo that contradicts her testimony.\n\nWait, Testimony 5 says that Vasquez went back to the trailer to get her script and direction notes. But Evidence 10 is the Script. If the script was found somewhere else, or if there's evidence that she couldn't have retrieved it, that would be a contradiction. Alternatively, maybe the Trailer Key (Evidence 8) is relevant here. If she needed the key to get into the trailer, but the key was found elsewhere, that might be a contradiction. But I need to check the exact details.\n\nWait, Vasquez's Testimony 5 says she went back to the trailer to get her script and direction notes. If she had the Trailer Key (Evidence 8) in her possession, but maybe the key was found elsewhere. Or perhaps the script (Evidence 10) was found in a place that contradicts her statement.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Evidence 9: Vasquez's Memo. Maybe the memo has information that she wasn't supposed to have the script, or that the script was somewhere else. Alternatively, maybe there's a timing issue. Let me think.\n\nWait, if she claims she went back to the trailer to get her script, but the script was found elsewhere, like at the crime scene, then that would contradict. For example, if the script (Evidence 10) was found in a location she couldn't have accessed, or if she had the script on her when she was supposed to have left it in the trailer. Alternatively, if the Trailer Key (Evidence 8) was needed to access the trailer, but the key was found with someone else, then she couldn't have entered the trailer without it, contradicting her testimony.\n\nBut wait, if Evidence 8 is the Trailer Key, perhaps it's found in someone else's possession. If, say, the key was found with another character, then Vasquez couldn't have used it to enter the trailer. But Vasquez is the one who had the memo (Evidence 9), and the trailer key (Evidence 8). Wait, no, the Evidence list shows each evidence's name. So Evidence 8 is Trailer Key. Who has that key? The problem doesn't specify who owns each evidence, just the list. So perhaps the Trailer Key is found in a location that conflicts with her testimony.\n\nAlternatively, considering Testimony 5 where she says she went to the trailer to get the script and direction notes. If the script (Evidence 10) was already in the trailer, but she took it, but then the script is found elsewhere, like in her possession, maybe that's not a contradiction. Wait, perhaps the direction notes are part of the evidence. Let me check the evidence list again.\n\nEvidence 10 is Script. Evidence 14 is \"Path to Glory\" which might be a direction note. Evidence 9 is Vasquez's Memo. If Vasquez claims she took the script and direction notes, but the script was found in the trailer, that contradicts. But if the script is in her possession, that's consistent. Alternatively, maybe she couldn't have accessed the trailer because the key was found elsewhere.\n\nWait, the Trailer Key (Evidence 8) might be required to enter the trailer. If she used the key to get in, but the key is found somewhere else, like in the possession of another character, that would mean she couldn't have used it. But without knowing who has which evidence, perhaps the key was found in the trailer, which would make sense. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at Testimony 7: Vasquez says she left the action scenes behind because Hammer was injured. But Evidence 3 is Jack's Autopsy Report. If the autopsy report shows that Hammer's injuries were recent or not severe enough to prevent action scenes, that might contradict her statement. However, the exact details of the autopsy report aren't given here, so this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 5: she went back to the trailer to get the script (Evidence 10) and direction notes. If the direction notes are Evidence 14 (\"Path to Glory\") but that's found elsewhere, like in the van (Evidence 18), then there's a contradiction. Or if the script was found in the trailer but she claimed to have taken it, that could be a problem. Wait, but if she took the script, then it would be in her possession, not in the trailer. So if the script was found in the trailer, then her testimony about taking it would be a lie. But Evidence 10 is just listed as \"Script\" without location. However, the problem doesn't specify where each evidence was found. So maybe this approach isn't the right way.\n\nAnother angle: looking at Testimony 6, she says she then went home. But perhaps the evidence like the Van (Evidence 18) or something else suggests she didn't go home. But again, without knowing where the van was found, it's hard.\n\nWait, let's look at the Security Lady (Oldbag) pointing at Powers (Testimony 3). Maybe there's evidence that contradicts Oldbag's accusation. For example, if Evidence 5 is a photo of Powers somewhere else, proving an alibi. But Evidence 5 is Powers'(?) Photo. If the photo shows Powers in a different place at the time of the murder, that would contradict Oldbag's testimony. But Testimony 3 is Vasquez recounting what Oldbag said. So maybe the contradiction is between Oldbag's accusation and, say, the photo. But the question is about evidence contradicting a testimony. Since the testimony is from Vasquez, the evidence needs to contradict Vasquez's own testimony.\n\nWait, the question asks for evidence and testimony that contradict each other. The testimony is from Vasquez. So I need to find an evidence that contradicts one of Vasquez's testimonies.\n\nLooking back at Testimony 5: she went to the trailer to get the script and direction notes. If the script (Evidence 10) was already in her possession, or if there's a memo (Evidence 9) that says she didn't need to retrieve the script, that could be a contradiction. Alternatively, maybe the Trailer Key (Evidence 8) was found in a place that shows she couldn't have accessed the trailer. For example, if the key was with another character, but the problem doesn't specify that.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider Testimony 7: she left the action scenes because Hammer was injured. But Evidence 3 is Jack's Autopsy Report. If the autopsy report shows that Hammer's injury was not recent, or that he died from something else, which contradicts her claim that he was injured and couldn't do action scenes. But again, without the details of the autopsy, it's hard to be certain. However, this is a possible angle.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 5: she went back to the trailer to get the script. If Evidence 10 (Script) has a note or time stamp showing it was accessed earlier, or if another evidence shows she was elsewhere. Hmm.\n\nWait, Evidence 9 is Vasquez's Memo. If her memo states that she didn't need to retrieve the script, or that the script was already with someone else, that would contradict Testimony 5. Alternatively, if the memo mentions that the script was already in her possession, then her going to the trailer to get it would be a lie.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Security Lady (Oldbag) said something that contradicts, but the testimony is from Vasquez. Hmm.\n\nAnother thought: Testimony 0 says Vasquez was with Sal and Oldbag when they found the body. But if there's evidence that Sal wasn't present, but Sal isn't listed as a character here. The characters are from 0 to 9, including Dee Vasquez (Character 9). Wait, Sal might be another person not listed here. But the problem states that the provided characters are those listed. So maybe Sal is an unlisted character. However, the evidence might refer to something involving Sal. But I don't see evidence related to Sal except maybe the van (Evidence 18: Van). If the van was used by Sal, but Vasquez's testimony says she was with Sal when they found the body, but the van was found elsewhere, maybe that's a contradiction. But without more info, this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 5: she went to the trailer to get the script. If the script (Evidence 10) is found in a different location, like the crime scene, which she shouldn't have had access to after leaving. But again, we don't know where the script was found.\n\nWait, Evidence 8 is Trailer Key. If the Trailer Key was found in the possession of another character, like the Security Lady (Character 4), then Vasquez couldn't have entered the trailer without the key, making her Testimony 5 a lie. But since the problem doesn't specify who has which evidence, maybe the key is linked to the trailer, and if she used it, she would have had it. Unless the key was missing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the script (Evidence 10) was actually in the van (Evidence 18), which would mean she didn't need to go to the trailer, contradicting her Testimony 5. But again, without location info, this is uncertain.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at Testimony 2: she called the police, then Powers showed up. If there's evidence that Powers was already present before the police were called, that would contradict. For example, if Powers' Photo (Evidence 5) shows him at the scene earlier. But again, we don't have details.\n\nWait, Evidence 5 is Powers'(?) Photo. If the photo shows Powers at the scene before the police were called, that would contradict Testimony 2 where Powers showed up after the police were called. So if the photo's timestamp is before the police call, that's a contradiction. However, we don't have the photo's details, but the name suggests ambiguity (the question mark), maybe indicating it's not clear if it's Powers in the photo. If the photo is actually of someone else, then Testimony 2's claim that Powers arrived after the police were called could be contradicted by the photo showing him earlier.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 6: Vasquez says she went home. But if Evidence 18 (Van) was found at the scene, implying she didn't leave, that contradicts. Or if her memo (Evidence 9) mentions she stayed, that's a contradiction. But again, we don't know the content of the memo.\n\nWait, Evidence 9 is Vasquez's Memo. If the memo states that she stayed at the studio or had other plans, contradicting her Testimony 6 of going home, that would be the contradiction. But the problem doesn't give the content of the memo. However, perhaps the memo's title implies something. For example, if the memo is a schedule that shows she had to stay, but she claims she went home.\n\nAlternatively, Testimony 5: she went to the trailer to get the script and direction notes. If the direction notes are \"Path to Glory\" (Evidence 14), which was found somewhere else, like the crime scene, that could contradict her taking them. But again, no info on Evidence 14's location.\n\nHmm. I'm going in circles. Let me think again. What's the most likely contradiction here?\n\nLooking at Testimony 5: She went back to the trailer to get her script and direction notes. The relevant evidence would be the Trailer Key (8), the Script (10), and maybe the direction notes (14). If she needed the Trailer Key to enter, but the key was found elsewhere, that's a contradiction. But the problem states \"Evidences\" as a list, not who has them. So maybe the key is in the trailer, implying she didn't need it, but that's not necessarily.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the script (10) was found in the trailer, which would mean she didn't take it, contradicting her testimony. But if she took it, it should be with her. So if the script was found in the trailer, then her statement is a lie. If the script was found elsewhere, like with her, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but in the evidence list, Script is Evidence 10. So if the script was found in her possession, that aligns with her testimony. If it's found in the trailer, then she lied. But how would we know where it was found? The problem doesn't specify, so maybe this approach isn't working.\n\nAnother angle: Testimony 7: She left the action scenes behind because Hammer was injured. The autopsy report (Evidence 3) might show that Hammer's injuries were not severe enough to prevent action scenes. For example, if the autopsy states that Hammer died from poisoning, not from injuries, then her reasoning for leaving the action scenes is contradicted. So if the autopsy report says cause of death was poisoning (sleeping pills, maybe Evidence 7: Empty Bottle \u2192 Sleeping Pill Bottle), then her claim that Hammer's injury prevented action scenes is irrelevant, implying she lied about the reason she left the scenes.\n\nSo, Evidence 3 (Jack's Autopsy Report) might state that the cause of death was poisoning, not injury-related, contradicting Testimony 7 where she says she left the scenes because Hammer was injured. Therefore, if the autopsy report shows the injury wasn't the cause of death, but she used that as the reason, there's a contradiction.\n\nBut the problem is whether the autopsy report's content contradicts her testimony. If the autopsy report says that Hammer had an old injury that had healed, then her claim that he couldn't do action scenes because of the injury would be a lie. Alternatively, if the injury was recent, then maybe it's true. But since the assistant is a character (Character 6), maybe there's another angle.\n\nAlternatively, if the autopsy report states the time of death, and that conflicts with her alibi. But that's more about timing than the injury.\n\nWait, Testimony 7 is about leaving action scenes because of Hammer's injury. If the autopsy report shows that Hammer wasn't injured, then her testimony is contradicted. So if Evidence 3 (autopsy) states no recent injuries, then she lied. So that's a possible contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the pair would be Evidence 3 and Testimony 7.\n\nBut let's confirm. Vasquez's Testimony 7: \"I knew that Hammer was injured and couldn't do any action scenes, so I left them behind.\" If the Autopsy Report (Evidence 3) shows that Hammer had no such injury, or that the injury was not sufficient to prevent action scenes, then this contradicts her testimony.\n\nSo the contradiction would be between Jack's Autopsy Report (Evidence 3) and Testimony 7."

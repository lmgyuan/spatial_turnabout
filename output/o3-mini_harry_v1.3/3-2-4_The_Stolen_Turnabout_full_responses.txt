Evidence 6 states that Mask DeMasque knocked Atmey out during the crime with a blow to the back of the head, which makes it impossible for Atmey to later testify in Testimony 5 that he “held the urn in my hands for the first time at 1 AM on October 12th.” This contradiction between being knocked out and actively handling the urn is a clear conflict.

******************************
Evidence 6 explicitly shows that Mask DeMasque struck Luke Atmey—knocking him out during the crime—yet in Testimony 0 Atmey claims he “had no points of contact with the victim whatsoever.” In other words, if Atmey was hit and rendered unconscious during the incident, his claim of having no contact (and by extension, no involvement) directly conflicts with the fact that he was physically engaged in the events as shown by the evidence.

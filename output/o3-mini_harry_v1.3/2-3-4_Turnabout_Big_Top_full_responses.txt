Evidence 15 describes the Max G. Bust as a heavy bronze statue, yet in Testimony 0 Acro claims, "I suppose I could have lifted something the size of that bust." The physical description of the bustâ€™s heft directly contradicts his claim about being capable of lifting such an object, making this pair a clear inconsistency.

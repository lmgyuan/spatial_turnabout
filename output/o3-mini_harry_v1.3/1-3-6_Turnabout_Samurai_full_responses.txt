Testimony 5 claims that Sal and Vasquez ate t‑bone steaks on the table in front of the trailer, yet Evidence 16 is a steak plate (with traces of sleeping pills and a large bone) found in the employee area rather than in front of the trailer. This suggests a contradiction as to where—and perhaps when—the steak meal took place.

Testimony 1 claims that only the assistant (along with others) was present at the scene and that Will Powers was absent. However, Evidence 5, the Powers’ Photo, shows him at the gate of the Studios at 2:00 PM—suggesting that he was in the vicinity. This clearly contradicts the statement that Powers was absent.

Trilo’s testimonies insist that he kept the engagement ring safely in his pocket that night, yet a cheap ring engraved “From T to R” (Evidence 10) was found at the scene. This inconsistency between his claim and the physical evidence forms a clear contradiction.

Testimony 4 casts doubt on what the suspect was carrying by saying, "His cloak was fluttering in the wind, so I couldn't really see what he was carrying." Yet, other parts of the witness’s statements (and the recovered items at the scene) clearly describe distinct carried items—most notably, Evidence 3, the Silk Hat, a signature symbol of Max’s fabulous style. In other words, the witness’s account in Testimony 4 would seem to undermine the ability to confidently identify such a clearly marked object as the hat that was later found at the scene. This is a contradiction between the physical evidence (the clearly identifiable Silk Hat) and the account that claims the suspect’s carried items weren’t clearly seen.

The contradiction is between the silk hat found at the scene (Evidence 3) and Moe’s testimony claiming that the hat was worn continuously by the culprit (Testimony 3). If the culprit was wearing the hat the entire time they were present, there would be no reason for it to be left behind and found as evidence on the crime scene. This directly contradicts the claim that it remained worn throughout the incident.

Testimony 2 states that the memo found next to the victim had the name “Maya” written in blood, implying it was a handwritten note. However, the only item with blood-written text is Evidence 3—a receipt for a glass light stand from the day before the murder—not a memo. This mismatch casts doubt on the claim in Testimony 2.

******************************
April’s testimony (Testimony 4) clearly identifies the murder weapon as the clock—“that clock” and even names “The Thinker”—but physical evidence suggests a very different weapon. Evidence 3, the Receipt, is for a glass light stand (and along with Evidence 2, its shattered remains, it implies that a glass light stand was involved). Since a clock and a glass light stand are distinct items, this testimony and evidence contradict each other.

Bikini claims in her testimony (Testimony 3) that Iris came to the Inner Temple dressed as she'd been at dinner, but Iris’s own testimony (Evidence 12) states that she rang the lights out bell at 10 PM and stayed in her room until the murder was discovered. This conflict about Iris’s whereabouts is a clear contradiction.

Testimony 3 from Bikini states that Iris wasn’t wearing her hood, yet Evidence 6—the magical hood that Iris is said to wear at all times—directly contradicts that claim.

Testimony 5 by Bikini claims that Mystic Ami (Maya Fey) was stabbing Elise with a blade, suggesting that a sword was used to commit the murder. However, Evidence 10—the Shichishito—despite having the victim's blood and suspect's fingerprints, is explicitly noted as not being the murder weapon. This directly contradicts the implication in Testimony 5 that the dagger/sword used by Mystic Ami was indeed responsible for the killing.

******************************
Bikini's Testimony 5 claims that "Iris could have done that. She can drive a snowmobile after all..." implying that she was physically active and possibly away from her room at the time of the murder. This stands in stark contrast to Iris’s own account (Evidence 12), in which she states that after ringing the lights out bell at 10 PM she stayed in her room until the murder was discovered. The inconsistency between Iris's stated whereabouts and Bikini’s suggestion provides a clear contradiction.

Testimony 2 states that Butz looked out the window and saw Dusky Bridge “on fire!” Yet according to the Weather Data (Evidence 7), lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM—with fire starting and smoldering for the next 30 minutes. This suggests the blaze couldn’t have been fully underway at an earlier time as Butz’s account implies. That discrepancy between the timeline in the Weather Data and Butz’s account of when he saw the fire is contradictory.

******************************
Butz claims in Testimony 2 that he saw Iris flying with her white hood fluttering; however, Evidence 12 records Iris’s own testimony stating that she rang the lights‐out bell at 10 PM and then stayed in her room until the murder was discovered. If Iris had been flying as Butz claims, she couldn’t have been in her room as she asserts. This clear contradiction between Iris’s account (Evidence 12) and Butz’s claim (Testimony 2) highlights a discrepancy in the narrative.

Testimony 3 states, "She threw her staff away and pulled a dagger from inside her robe!" implying that the dagger was used as the murder weapon. However, Evidence 10 (the Shichishito) is a dagger bearing the victim's blood and the suspect’s fingerprints yet is specifically noted as not being the murder weapon. This inconsistency between testimony and evidence highlights a clear contradiction.

******************************
Testimony 3 claims that Mystic Maya stabbed Mystic Elise, implying that the stabbing weapon used in the murder was the one in her grasp. However, Evidence 10—despite bearing the victim’s blood and suspect’s fingerprints—explicitly notes that the Shichishito is not the murder weapon. This contradiction between Maya being the murderer (as claimed) and the fact that the apparent murder weapon was not actually used to kill Elise is an important inconsistency.

Evidence 7 (Weather Data) and Testimony 6 (Iris's statement) contradict each other. According to Evidence 7, it was snowing until approximately 10:50 PM, while Iris claims in Testimony 6 that by the time the murder took place the snow had already stopped. This discrepancy in the timeline regarding when the snow stopped indicates an inconsistency between the weather data and Iris's account.

Maya claims in Testimony 4 that she saw a man behind her attacker illuminated by the light of the stone lantern. However, Evidence 20 states that the stone lantern was not lit on the night of the crime, which contradicts Maya’s account of witnessing someone by its light.

******************************
Maya testified that “the torches were lit… And the body was gone,” yet the stone lantern (Evidence 20) was found not lit that fateful night. This inconsistency between a claimed lit source and a physical lantern that wasn’t lit is the contradiction.

******************************
Maya testified that “Pearly was also stuck on the Inner Temple side that night” (Testimony 0), implying that Pearl Fey never left the safety of the temple grounds. Yet Larry’s Sketch (Evidence 15) clearly shows a figure gliding across a burning bridge that night—a detail that suggests someone was seen on Dusky Bridge instead of inside the temple. This single pair of evidence and testimony contradicts each other.

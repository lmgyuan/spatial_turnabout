Alright, let's try to figure this out. So, I've got a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. My goal is to find a contradiction between evidence and testimony. That is, I need to find a pair where one of the evidence items is in direct contradiction to one of the testimonies.

First, I need to understand the characters. There's Trucy Wright, my adopted daughter. She's a magician. Athena Cykes is my new lawyer, and she's a psychology expert. Larry Butz is an old friend, an aspiring picture book author. Ellen Wyatt is my client, works as a maid for the Sprocket family.

Ema Skye is a detective friend. She's a forensics investigator. Miles Edgeworth is the district's chief prosecutor, and my childhood friend. Dumas Gloomsbury is the victim, the lead servant of the Sprocket family. Sorin Sprocket is Ellen's fiancé, meticulous about his note taking. Pierce Nichody is the Sprocket family butler, unusually attached to a pocket watch. Selena Sprocket is Sorin's older sister, who passed away in a car accident.

Now, looking at the evidences, I see evidence 0 is the Attorney's Badge, which is just my attorney's badge. Evidence 1 is Ellen's Pendant, a pendant she wears, which seems to have come from her fiancé, Sorin.

Evidence 2 is Ellen's Statement, where she says she saw a suspicious third party on the vista deck when attacked by Gloomsbury. Evidence 3 is the Flying Chapel Pamphlet, which includes a diagram of the reception hall.

Evidence 4 is the Time Keeper, the murder weapon. Evidence 5 is the Broken Lantern, which is where the victim's body was found, and it's a broken lantern. Evidence 6 is a photo of the victim's body.

Evidence 7 is Gloomsbury's Note, a note found near the victim's body, written by a right-handed person. Evidence 8 is the Fog Machine, which is a device that emits fog. Evidence 9 is a Business Card Wallet with a peculiar imprint.

Evidence 10 is the Hold Entry Record, a record of the hold. Evidence 11 is a photo of Selena Sprocket.

Evidence 12 is Larry's Drawing, a drawing Larry made from a cabin. Evidence 13 is the Photo of Hold, a photo of the hold, showing Ellen near the center.

Evidence 14 is the Autopsy Report, showing Gloomsbury was hit twice. Evidence 15 is the Hold Entry Record, showing the hold was accessed.

Evidence 16 is the Lift Bloodstain, a bloodstain on the lift. Evidence 17 is the Candelabra, the murder weapon, used on the victim.

Evidence 18 is Sorin's Notebook, which was torn out of the notebook. Evidence 19 is the Newspaper Article, about the car accident.

Evidence 20 is the Key of Love, used to activate the Time Keeper.

Now, looking at testimonies, the first testimony says that the Attorney's Badge is my badge. The second testimony says the Ellen's Pendant is from her fiancé. The third testimony says that I rushed to the scene, but the crime had already been committed. The fourth testimony says that I saw Gloomsbury and Master Sorin writing in his notebook. The fifth testimony says that I took the blame for the murder, so I took care of Ellen.

Wait, but the fifth testimony says that I took the blame for the murder, so please take care of Ellen. So, the fifth testimony says that I took the blame for the murder, so please take care of Ellen.

But wait, the third testimony says that I rushed to the scene, but the crime had already been committed.

Explanation: Evidence 4 (Folding Screen) shows a bullet hole, while Testimony 0 claims Maya stabbed Dr. Grey in the chest. However, the autopsy report indicates that Dr. Grey was shot at point-blank, not stabbed. This contradicts the testimony that a stabbing occurred. The actual cause of death was the gunshot, not a stabbing.

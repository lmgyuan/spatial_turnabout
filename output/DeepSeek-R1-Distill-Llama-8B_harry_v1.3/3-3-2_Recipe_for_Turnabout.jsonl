Explanation: Evidence 5 (Autopsy Report) and Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) indicate that Glen Elg died at 1:30 PM, while Testimony 0 (Gumshoe) claims the crime was reported at 2:25 PM. This discrepancy suggests that either the time of the crime was misreported or the evidence contradicts the testimony.

Explanation: The crime photo (Evidence 12) shows an intact vase on the table, while Victor's testimony (Evidence 18) claims he broke the vase. This contradiction suggests that Victor's account is inconsistent with the evidence, as the vase was not broken during the incident.

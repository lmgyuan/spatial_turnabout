Explanation: Evidence 5 (Powers' (?) Photo) and Testimony 3 (Security Lady's testimony) contradict each other because Cody's testimony that he was at the studio around 2:00 PM (evidence of the photo) contradicts the security lady's claim that only Will Powers was there before the murder. If Cody was there, he should have been seen by the security lady.

Explanation: The evidence (Kane's Autopsy Report) confirms that Kane Bullard died at 1:00 AM on October 12th, while Luke Atmey's testimony places the crime at 1:30 AM. This time discrepancy suggests that either Luke's memory is inaccurate or there's another factor affecting the timeline, indicating a potential contradiction in the testimonies.
Explanation: Evidence 15 (Kane's Autopsy Report) indicates that Kane Bullard died at 1:00 AM on October 12th, while Evidence 19 (Buzzer Record) shows that the CEO's office buzzer went off at 1:02 AM, suggesting Kane was still alive at that time. This discrepancy contradicts the timeline provided by the testimonies, indicating an inconsistency in the evidence and testimony regarding the timing of the crime.

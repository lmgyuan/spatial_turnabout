{"evidence": 20, "testimony": 0}
Explanation: Evidence 20 (the letter from the safe stating "Get your revenge on Miles Edgeworth") contradicts Testimony 0, which claims that Miles Edgeworth was the one on the boat. The letter suggests that the revenge was meant for Edgeworth, implying he was the target, not the perpetrator. The testimony incorrectly identifies Edgeworth as involved in the murder, whereas the evidence shows Robert Hammond was the victim, and Edgeworth was the one who fired the shots.

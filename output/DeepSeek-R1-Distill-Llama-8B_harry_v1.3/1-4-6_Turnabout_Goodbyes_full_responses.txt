Alright, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

First, I need to understand the characters, evidences, and testimonies provided. There are multiple characters involved, including Mia Fey, Miles Edgeworth, Dick Gumshoe, and others. The incident seems to revolve around a murder that happened around Christmas, involving a boat rental shop, a monster sighting, and some key evidence like a letter from a safe.

Looking at the testimonies, Testimony 0 is from Edgeworth, who claims he was in the courtroom that day and heard a gunshot. The evidence mentions a bullet hole in the door of the courtroom, suggesting that the gunshot might have been inside. However, the letter from the safe says, "Get your revenge on Miles Edgeworth," which implies that Edgeworth was the target of the murder, not the perpetrator.

Wait, that seems contradictory. If Edgeworth was the one who fired the gunshot, he wouldn't be the one being targeted for revenge. The letter suggests that someone else was the shooter. So, Testimony 0 might be incorrect because it places Edgeworth at the scene of the crime, while the evidence points to someone else as the murderer.

But I need to make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me cross-reference the evidence. The DL-6 Case File mentions that the murder weapon was fired twice, and the DL-6 Incident Photo shows a bullet hole in the door. These support the idea that the shooter was outside, given the bullet hole, and fired twice.

On the other hand, Testimony 0 from Edgeworth claims he was inside the courtroom when he heard the gunshot and a scream. If that's true, then the bullet hole in the door doesn't make sense because the gunshot was inside. This inconsistency suggests that Edgeworth's testimony is conflicting with the evidence.

So, the contradiction is between Testimony 0 (Edgeworth's account) and the evidence (bullet hole in the door, letter from the safe). The testimony places Edgeworth inside the courtroom when the gunshot occurred, which doesn't align with the evidence indicating an external shooter.

Therefore, the pair that contradicts each other is the evidence (20, "DL-6 Case File") and the testimony (0, Testimony 0).

{"evidence": 30, "testimony": 4}
{"evidence": 15, "testimony": 5}
Explanation: The evidence (Knife with Engarde's fingerprints) directly links Matt Engarde to the murder, while Testimony 4 (de Killer) claims that Adrian Andrews knew Juan Corrida was dead and that evidence was planted to frame someone else. This contradiction arises because the testimony attempts to shift blame to Andrews, contradicting the physical evidence that incriminates Engarde.

{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 0}
Explanation: The evidence (Kane's Autopsy Report and Buzzer Record) indicates that Kane Bullard died at 1:00 AM, while the testimony (Testimony 5) places the crime at 1:30 AM. This time discrepancy suggests that either Luke Atmey's memory is inaccurate or there's another factor affecting the timeline, indicating a potential contradiction between the evidence and the testimony regarding the timing of the crime.

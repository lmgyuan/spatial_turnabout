Explanation: Evidence 16 (the Note) indicates that the killer had prior knowledge of the meeting and planned to meet at the lodging house plaza at 10:00 PM. However, Testimony 5 suggests that Trilo was present at the crime scene with the intention of proposing to Regina Berry, not to commit a murder. This contradiction arises because Trilo's testimony does not align with the evidence of a premeditated meeting, as he was there for a different purpose.
Explanation: The evidence (Note) indicates that the meeting was set up by Acro, while Trilo's testimony incorrectly places Max at the scene. This contradiction shows that Trilo's account does not align with the evidence.
Explanation: Evidence 16 (Note) indicates that Acro placed the note, suggesting his involvement, while Testimony 4 (Moe) claims to have seen Max at the scene. This contradiction arises because Moe's testimony incorrectly identifies Max as the killer, whereas the evidence supports Acro as the murderer.

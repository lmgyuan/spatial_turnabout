Alright, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let me start by going through the details provided.

First, the characters involved include Maya Fey, who is the defendant, and a bunch of other people like Dick Gumshoe, the detective, and various witnesses and experts. The main crime is the murder of Dr. Turner Grey, who was the director of the Grey Surgical Clinic. There was a malpractice incident a year ago where 14 patients died, which seems relevant.

Looking at the evidences, there's a lot to unpack. Evidence 0 is the Attorney's Badge, which seems more about establishing Maya's identity as a defense attorney. Evidence 1 is the Guidemap of Fey Manor, which probably shows the layout of the crime scene. Evidence 2 is Maya's Magatama, which is some kind of spiritual artifact. Evidence 3 is a Newspaper Clipping about the malpractice incident, which might link to the current crime. Evidence 4 is a Folding Screen with a bullet hole, indicating a struggle. Evidence 5 is a Black Key, maybe used to unlock something. Evidence 6 is another Newspaper Clipping about Mimi Miney's death, which connects to the clinic. Evidence 7 are Floor Plans of the crime scene, which could show where the murder happened. Evidence 8 is Dr. Grey's Autopsy Report, showing he was shot and stabbed. Evidence 9 is the Pistol used in the murder, with Maya and Grey's fingerprints. Evidence 10 is a Knife, also used in the murder, with Maya's fingerprints. Evidence 11 is Maya's Costume, which has blood and a bullet hole. Evidence 12 and 13 are photos taken by Lotta Hart showing Maya at the crime scene. Evidence 14 is the Sacred Urn, which is broken. Evidence 15 is a Cloth Scrap with blood, and Evidence 16 is Pearl's Ball, a toy. Evidence 17 is a Clothing Box with a bullet hole, and Evidence 18 is Ini's License Photo.

Now, the testimonies: Testimony 0 from Gumshoe says there's incriminating evidence, Testimony 1 shows the costume with blood, and Testimony 2 says Grey was not fighting back.

So, I need to find a pair where an evidence contradicts a testimony. Let's look at each testimony and see if any evidence contradicts it.

Testimony 0: "Sorry, pal, but there's an even more incriminating piece of evidence." This seems like a detective's statement, but it doesn't specify what evidence. Maybe it's a red herring.

Testimony 1: "This is the costume the defendant was wearing at the time of the crime." Gumshoe is stating that Maya was wearing the costume during the murder. The evidence for this is Evidence 11, Maya's Costume, which has blood and a bullet hole. So Testimony 1 aligns with Evidence 11.

Testimony 2: "As you can see, it's covered in blood." Gumshoe is talking about the costume, which matches Evidence 11 again.

Wait, but the user wants a contradiction. Maybe the number of times the weapon was fired? Evidence 9 and 10 mention the Pistol was fired twice and the Knife was used. But the Autopsy Report says Grey was stabbed and then shot at point-blank. So maybe the number of shots contradicts something.

Alternatively, maybe the clothing box (Evidence 17) has a bullet hole, which aligns with the Costume's bullet hole. But that doesn't contradict.

Wait, maybe the number of bullets. The Pistol was fired twice, but the Autopsy shows one shot to the chest and one to the forehead. So the two shots match the evidence. But what about the Knife? If the Knife was used, that adds another wound, but the Autopsy only mentions two shots. So maybe the Knife's presence contradicts the Autopsy.

But looking at the testimonies, none mention the Knife. So maybe not.

Alternatively, the Black Key (Evidence 5) might not have been used, but that's speculative.

Another angle: The Newspaper Clipping (Evidence 3) mentions the malpractice, but the current crime is a murder, so that might not directly contradict anything.

Wait, maybe the number of people involved. If the Newspaper Clipping mentions Mimi Miney's death, but the current crime involves Grey, perhaps that's a different incident.

I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I need to focus on the testimonies and see if any directly contradict the evidence.

Testimony 2 says Grey wasn't fighting back. But the Folding Screen (Evidence 4) shows a struggle, and the Costume has blood, indicating a fight. So maybe Testimony 2 contradicts Evidence 4 and 11.

Alternatively, the Bullet Hole in the Clothing Box (Evidence 17) and the Costume (Evidence 11) both show a bullet, so they don't contradict.

I think the contradiction is between Testimony 2 and the evidence showing a struggle (Evidence 4 and 11). So Testimony 2 says Grey wasn't fighting back, but the evidence shows he was involved in a struggle, thus contradicting the testimony.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this scenario. There are a lot of characters, evidences, and testimonies to consider, so I'll need to carefully go through each piece of information to identify any conflicts.

First, I'll list out the key elements to keep track of:

- **Characters**: 
  - Maya Fey
  - Dr. Turner Grey
  - Pearl Fey
  - Morgan Fey
  - Lotta Hart
  - Dick Gumshoe
  - Ini Miney
  - Mimi Miney
  - Mia Fey
  - Franziska von Karma
  - Ami Fey
  - Director Hotti (purported)

- **Evidences**:
  - Attorney's Badge
  - Guidemap (Fey Manor)
  - Maya's Magatama
  - Newspaper Clipping 1
  - Folding Screen
  - Black Key
  - Newspaper Clipping 2
  - Floor Plans (Crime Scene)
  - Dr. Grey's Autopsy Report
  - Pistol
  - Knife
  - Maya's Costume
  - Lotta's Photo 1
  - Lotta's Photo 2
  - Sacred Urn
  - Cloth Scrap
  - Pearl's Ball
  - Clothing Box
  - License Photo

- **Testimonies**:
  - Testimony 0: During the channeling, the defendant saw her chance to stab the victim in the chest.
  - Testimony 1: Of course, the victim used the last of his strength to fight back, sir.
  - Testimony 2: While the two were fighting, the victim took out his gun.
  - Testimony 3: The victim took a shot, but because they were too close, he missed.
  - Testimony 4: The defendant then picked up on the opening and took the victim's gun, and ended it...

Now, I'll go through each testimony and see how it aligns with the evidence.

**Testimony 0**: This testimony states that the defendant (Maya) saw her chance to stab the victim (Dr. Turner Grey) in the chest during the channeling. 

Looking at the evidence, **Evidence 8** (Dr. Grey's Autopsy Report) mentions that Grey was stabbed in the chest and then shot in the forehead at point-blank range. This suggests that Grey was first stabbed and then shot, which aligns with Testimony 0. 

However, **Testimony 4** mentions that the defendant took the victim's gun and ended it. This implies that the victim was alive after being stabbed, took out his gun, and was then shot by the defendant. But according to the autopsy report, the victim was shot after being stabbed, which supports Testimony 4 as well.

Wait, there seems to be a potential conflict here. If the victim was already dead after being stabbed, how could he take out his gun and shoot the defendant? The autopsy report indicates that the victim was shot after being stabbed, which suggests that the victim was alive when the shooting occurred. Therefore, Testimony 4 is supported by the evidence.

But let's look at the other testimonies to see if there's a contradiction.

**Testimony 1**: The victim used the last of his strength to fight back. This aligns with the autopsy report, which doesn't mention any defensive wounds, but the testimony suggests the victim was still alive and fighting, which is possible.

**Testimony 2**: The victim took out his gun while fighting. This is consistent with the autopsy report, as the victim was shot after being stabbed, implying he had the presence of mind to retrieve his gun.

**Testimony 3**: The victim took a shot but missed because they were too close. This is a bit confusing because the autopsy report indicates that the victim was shot at point-blank range, which would suggest the shot was successful. However, the testimony says the victim missed, which contradicts the evidence.

Wait, that's a clear contradiction. The autopsy report says the victim was shot at point-blank, which should have been a fatal shot. But Testimony 3 claims the victim missed the shot, implying he didn't die immediately. This discrepancy suggests that Testimony 3 contradicts the evidence.

Additionally, **Evidence 9** (Pistol) mentions that the murder weapon was Grey's and that two shots were fired, with Maya's and Grey's fingerprints. This aligns with the testimony that Grey took a shot, but if he missed, it doesn't fully explain the evidence. However, the key contradiction is between the testimony and the autopsy report regarding whether the shot was successful.

Therefore, Testimony 3 contradicts the evidence from the autopsy report and the pistol evidence.

Alright, so I've got this murder mystery to solve, and I need to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the characters involved. There's Maya Fey, who's training to become a spirit medium; Miles Edgeworth, a ruthless prosecutor; Dick Gumshoe, the detective in charge; Will Powers, the defendant who's an action star; and several others like the Security Lady, the Assistant, The Director, Cody Hackins, and Dee Vasquez.

Now, the evidence list includes things like the Attorney's Badge, Powers's Letter, Guidemap, Jack's Autopsy Report, Cardkey, Powers' Photo, Samurai Spear, Empty Bottle, Trailer Key, Vasquez's Memo, Script, Mr. Monkey's Head, Steel Samurai Card, "Path to Glory," Cody's Camera, Steak Plate, Five-Year-Old Photo, and Van.

The testimonies are from Oldbag, who was at the main gate from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. He mentions that the murder happened at 2:30 PM and that he saw Powers heading toward the studio at 2:00 PM.

So, the question is: Which evidence and testimony contradict each other?

Looking at the testimonies, Oldbag says that at 2:00 PM, he saw Powers heading toward the studio. The evidence includes Powers's Photo, taken at 2:00 PM, showing Powers dragging one leg and walking toward the studio. That seems to support Oldbag's testimony.

But wait, there's also the Samurai Spear, which was found stuck in Jack Hammer's chest, indicating that Powers used it as the murder weapon. The Empty Bottle contains sleeping pills with Jack's fingerprints. The Script and Vasquez's Memo mention bringing the script from Episode 13, which might relate to the timing or motive.

However, the key point is the timeline. Oldbag was at the gate from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM and saw Powers at 2:00 PM heading toward the studio. Powers's Photo corroborates this. The Samurai Spear and Empty Bottle suggest that Powers was at the scene around 2:30 PM, which aligns with the murder time. But if Powers was at the studio at 2:00 PM, he would have arrived before the murder, which seems possible.

Wait, but if the murder happened at 2:30 PM, and Powers was at the studio at 2:00 PM, he might have had time to commit the murder. But if Oldbag was at the gate, he couldn't have seen the actual murder, but he saw Powers entering the studio at 2:00 PM. The evidence supports that Powers was present at the studio around that time, which is consistent with the murder timeline.

However, maybe there's a contradiction if the evidence suggests that Powers was elsewhere or if the testimony places him elsewhere. But from what I can see, the testimonies and evidence align, not contradict.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the evidence about the broken Spear and the sleeping pills indicates that Powers was in a different location, but the testimonies and photo place him at the studio. Alternatively, if the evidence suggests Powers was in a different part of the studio, it might contradict Oldbag's testimony.

But based on the given information, the testimonies and evidence support each other. So, maybe there's no direct contradiction here.

Wait, perhaps the Empty Bottle and Steak Plate suggest that Powers was in the employee area, which aligns with Oldbag's testimony that he saw Powers heading toward the studio. So, no contradiction there.

I think I need to check if any evidence directly contradicts the testimony. Since Oldbag's testimony is supported by Powers's Photo, and the evidence about the Spear and Empty Bottle supports the murder time and location, there's no contradiction.

So, in conclusion, the testimonies and evidence do not contradict each other in this scenario.

{"evidence": 15, "testimony": 6}
Okay, so I need to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let me start by reading through all the information provided carefully.

First, I'll list out the characters involved to get a clear picture. The main players here are Will Powers, the defendant, and Jack Hammer, the victim. There's also Miles Edgeworth, the prosecutor, Dick Gumshoe, the detective, and a few others like the Security Lady and some studio employees.

Now, looking at the testimonies, Testimony 0 says that the time of poor Hammer's death was 2:30 PM. That's straightforward. Testimony 1 says that the only person they saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers. Testimony 2 reinforces that no one else went there, and Testimony 3 says if anyone else had gone, they would have seen them.

Now, looking at the evidence, Evidence 5 is a photo taken at the gate between the entrance and the studios at 2:00 PM, showing Will Powers walking, dragging one leg. The caption mentions that the camera takes a picture automatically whenever someone walks by. That seems to support Testimony 1 that Will Powers was at the studio around 2:00 PM, heading towards it.

But wait, Testimony 0 states that the murder happened at 2:30 PM. So if the photo was taken at 2:00 PM, that would mean Will Powers was at the studio before the murder occurred. But Testimony 1 says he was the only one who went there before 2:30 PM. However, if the photo was taken at 2:00 PM, and the murder happened at 2:30 PM, that could mean that Will Powers was at the studio but not necessarily at the exact time of the murder.

But Testimony 3 says that if anyone else had gone, they would have seen them. So if someone else was there, they should have been seen by the guard. But the evidence shows that only Will Powers was seen at 2:00 PM, walking towards the studio. There's no evidence of anyone else being there.

However, Evidence 5 mentions that the camera takes a picture automatically whenever someone walks by. That implies that the photo was taken because Will Powers passed by, but it doesn't necessarily mean he was the only one there. Maybe others were there but didn't trigger the camera. But the testimonies say that no one else was there.

Wait, but if the photo was taken at 2:00 PM, and the murder happened at 2:30 PM, then Will Powers was at the studio before the murder. But Testimony 1 says he was the only one who went there before 2:30 PM. That seems consistent. So where's the contradiction?

Ah, maybe I'm missing something. The testimonies say that the only person they saw go to the studio before 2:30 PM was Will Powers. But if the photo was taken at 2:00 PM, showing him there, that aligns with that testimony. However, Testimony 3 says that if anyone else had gone, they would have been seen. But the evidence doesn't show anyone else being there.

Wait, but the testimonies are from the Oldbag, who was at the guard station. So if the photo was taken at 2:00 PM, and the murder happened at 2:30 PM, then Will Powers was there before the murder, and no one else was there. That matches the testimonies. So maybe I'm looking in the wrong place.

Wait, let me check the evidence again. Evidence 5 is Powers's photo at 2:00 PM, which is before the murder at 2:30 PM. That means Will Powers was at the studio before the murder, but the testimonies say that he was the only one there before 2:30 PM. So that's consistent.

But then why is there a contradiction? Maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Let me think again.

Wait, the testimonies say that the only person they saw go to the studio before 2:30 PM was Will Powers. So if the photo was taken at 2:00 PM, showing him there, that's consistent. But Testimony 3 says that if anyone else had gone, they would have been seen. But since no one else was seen, that's also consistent.

Wait, but the testimonies are from Oldbag, who was at the guard station. So if Will Powers was at the studio at 2:00 PM, and the murder happened at 2:30 PM, that means he was there before the murder. But the testimonies don't say he was there at the time of the murder, just that he was seen going there before 2:30 PM.

Hmm, maybe the contradiction is that the testimonies say that no one else was there, but the evidence shows that Will Powers was there, which aligns with the testimonies. So perhaps there's no contradiction. But the user is asking which evidence and testimony contradict each other, so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let me read the testimonies again. Testimony 0: The time of poor Hammer's death was 2:30 PM, true? Testimony 1: The only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers! Testimony 2: No one else went there! Testimony 3: If they had, I would have seen them!

So the testimonies are saying that Will Powers was the only one who went to the studio before 2:30 PM, and if anyone else had gone, they would have been seen. But the evidence, Evidence 5, shows a photo of Will Powers at 2:00 PM, heading towards the studio. That supports the testimonies because it shows Will Powers was there, and no one else was seen.

Wait, but the user is asking for a contradiction. Maybe the contradiction is that the testimonies say that Will Powers was the only one there, but the evidence shows that he was there, which is consistent. So perhaps there's no contradiction. But the user is asking for a pair that contradicts, so maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Alternatively, maybe the contradiction is that the testimonies say that the only person seen going to the studio was Will Powers, but the evidence shows that he was there at 2:00 PM, which is before the murder at 2:30 PM, implying he was present at the time of the murder, which would make him the killer. But if that's the case, then Testimony 1 says he was the only one there, which is consistent.

Wait, but the victim is Jack Hammer, and the defendant is Will Powers. So if Will Powers was at the studio before the murder, he could have been the killer. But the testimonies don't directly link him to the murder, except that he was there.

Hmm, maybe the contradiction is that the testimonies say that Will Powers was the only one there, but the evidence shows that he was there, which is consistent. So perhaps the user is looking for a different contradiction.

Wait, let me check the other testimonies. Testimony 0 is about the time of death, which is 2:30 PM. Testimony 1 is about Will Powers being the only one seen going to the studio before that time. Testimony 2 says no one else went there, and Testimony 3 says that if anyone else had gone, they would have been seen.

So, the testimonies are consistent with the evidence. Therefore, perhaps there is no contradiction. But the user is asking for a pair that contradicts, so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is that the testimonies say that Will Powers was the only one there, but the evidence shows that he was there at 2:00 PM, which is before the murder, implying he was present at the time of the crime. But the testimonies don't say anything about him being the killer, just that he was there. So maybe the contradiction is that the evidence shows he was there, but the testimonies don't directly link him to the murder.

But the user is asking for a contradiction between evidence and testimony, not necessarily that the evidence shows he's guilty. So perhaps the contradiction is that the testimonies say that Will Powers was the only one there, but the evidence shows that he was there, which is consistent, so there's no contradiction.

Wait, but the user is asking for a pair that contradicts, so maybe I'm supposed to find that the testimonies and evidence don't align. Perhaps the testimonies say that no one else was there, but the evidence shows that someone else was there, or vice versa.

But in this case, the testimonies say that Will Powers was the only one there, and the evidence shows that he was there, so they align. Therefore, perhaps there's no contradiction, but the user is asking for a pair, so maybe I need to consider that the testimonies are from Oldbag, who was at the guard station, and the evidence is from the photo, which is at the gate. So maybe the testimonies are from a different perspective, but the evidence supports the testimonies.

I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to summarize:

- Testimony 0: Death at 2:30 PM.
- Testimony 1: Only Will Powers went to the studio before 2:30 PM.
- Testimony 2: No one else went there.
- Testimony 3: If anyone else had gone, they would have been seen.

Evidence 5: Photo of Will Powers at 2:00 PM, heading towards the studio.

So the testimonies are saying that Will Powers was the only one there before 2:30 PM, and the evidence supports that. Therefore, they don't contradict each other.

But the user is asking for a pair that contradicts, so perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the contradiction is that the testimonies say that Will Powers was the only one there, but the evidence shows that he was there, which is consistent, so there's no contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the user is looking for a different pair.

Alternatively, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 0 and Evidence 3. Testimony 0 says the death was at 2:30 PM, and Evidence 3 is the autopsy report, which also says 2:30 PM. So they don't contradict.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 1 and Evidence 5. Testimony 1 says that only Will Powers went there before 2:30 PM, and Evidence 5 shows that he was there at 2:00 PM, which aligns with that. So no contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is that the testimonies say that Will Powers was the only one there, but the evidence shows that he was there, which is consistent, so no contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the user is looking for a different pair.

Alternatively, maybe the contradiction is between Testimony 3 and Evidence 5. Testimony 3 says that if anyone else had gone, they would have been seen, but the evidence shows that only Will Powers was there, so that's consistent.

I'm not seeing a direct contradiction between the evidence and testimonies provided. Maybe the user is referring to a different pair. But based on the information given, I can't find a direct contradiction between Evidence 5 and any testimony, as they seem to align.

{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 18}
Explanation: Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) shows an intact vase on the table, while Victor's testimony (Evidence 18) claims he broke the vase. This contradiction suggests that Victor's account is inconsistent with the evidence, as the vase was not broken during the incident.
Explanation: The Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows an intact vase, while Victor's testimony (Evidence 18) claims he broke it, creating a contradiction.
Explanation: Evidence 2 (Sports Paper) shows Victor Kudo was at Tres Bien on December 3rd, the day of the theft, contradicting his testimony that he wasn't involved and never met Glen Elg. This contradiction arises because Victor's own actions place him at the scene, implying his direct involvement, despite his claims to the contrary.

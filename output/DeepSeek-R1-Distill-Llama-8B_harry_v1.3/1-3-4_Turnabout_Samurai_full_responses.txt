Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let's start by looking at the testimonies and the evidence provided.

First, I see that there are several testimonies from Cody. He talks about wanting to see a Steel Samurai rehearsal, finding a map online, going off the path to avoid the old lady, and ending up at the studio where he saw the Steel Samurai in action. His testimony seems to suggest that he was at the studio around the time of the murder, specifically around 2:00 PM.

Now, looking at the evidence, there's a photo taken at the gate between the entrance and the studios at 2:00 PM showing the Steel Samurai, which is Will Powers, dragging one leg. This matches with Cody's testimony about seeing the Steel Samurai at that time.

But wait, there's also a security camera photo from 2:30 PM, which is when the murder happened. However, Cody said he was there around 2:00 PM, which is before the murder. That doesn't necessarily contradict anything yet.

Then, I notice that the security lady mentioned that the only person she saw going to the studio before 2:30 PM was Will Powers. If Cody was there at 2:00 PM, he would have been seen by the security lady, right? But she didn't mention seeing him. That seems like a contradiction.

So, Cody's testimony that he was at the studio around 2:00 PM contradicts the security lady's testimony that only Will Powers went to the studio before the murder. If Cody was there, he should have been recorded by the security camera or seen by the security lady.

Therefore, the evidence (the photo at 2:00 PM and the security camera footage at 2:30 PM) supports Cody's testimony, but it contradicts the security lady's claim that only Will Powers was there. This inconsistency suggests that Cody was at the studio around the time of the crime, which wasn't reported by the security lady, leading to a potential conflict in their testimonies.

{"evidence": 5, "testimony": 3}

Explanation: Evidence 5 (Powers' (?) Photo) and Testimony 3 (Security Lady's testimony) contradict each other because Cody's testimony that he was at the studio around 2:00 PM (evidence of the photo) contradicts the security lady's claim that only Will Powers was there before the murder. If Cody was there, he should have been seen by the security lady.
Alright, let's try to figure this out step by step. So, the question is asking which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this scenario. I need to carefully examine the given information to find a pair that directly oppose each other.

First, I'll look at the testimonies. Testimony 0 is from Cody, who says, "Yeah, you're right, pops." That seems like a non-controversial statement, so it's probably not the one. Testimony 1: "The Steel Samurai had just escaped from the clutches of the villain." That's a detailed description of what Cody saw. Testimony 2: "So I held up my camera to take a picture!" This is about Cody's actions with the camera. Testimony 3: "But the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it." This explains why he didn't get a good photo. Testimony 4: "Th-that's all that happened. Yup." That's a summary of his experience.

Now, looking at the evidence, Evidence 5 is the Powers' (?) Photo, which shows Will Powers dragging one leg at 2:00 PM. Evidence 15 is Cody's Camera, which he used but didn't capture the moment properly.

So, Testimony 5 says Cody took a few shots but they were erased. Evidence 15 supports this because Cody was using the camera. However, if Cody was at the studio around 2:00 PM (as shown by Evidence 5), then the Security Lady's claim that only Powers was there before the murder should be contradicted by Cody's presence. But the testimonies don't directly mention the Security Lady's statement, so I need to see if any testimonies are in conflict.

Wait, Testimony 3 says the lens didn't open in time, so he missed capturing the photo. But Evidence 5 shows a photo was taken at 2:00 PM. That's a conflict because Cody claims he tried to take a photo but failed, yet a photo exists. Therefore, Testimony 5 contradicts Evidence 5.

So, the conflicting pair is Evidence 5 and Testimony 5.

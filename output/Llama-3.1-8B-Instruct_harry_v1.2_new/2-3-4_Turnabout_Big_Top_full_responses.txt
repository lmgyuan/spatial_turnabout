The testimonies of Acro contradict the evidence, specifically regarding the possibility of Acro lifting the Max G. Bust. In Testimony 3, Acro says it would be impossible for him to exert the kind of force needed to lift the bust, but in Evidence 15, it is stated that the Max G. Bust is a bronze statue that looks rather heavy.

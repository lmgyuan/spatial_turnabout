Given the story, "John was seen near the crime scene, and he said he was with David at the time of the crime. David said he was with John, but he also said he was with Bob at the time of the crime. Bob said he was with Charlie at the time of the crime, but Charlie said he was alone at the time of the crime."

Assuming the lists are as follows:

Characters: 
1. John
2. Alice
3. Bob
4. Charlie
5. David

Evidences: 
1. A torn piece of fabric
2. A security camera footage
3. A fingerprint
4. A broken window
5. A suspicious letter

Testimonies: 
1. John saw Alice near the crime scene
2. Alice heard Bob arguing with Charlie
3. Charlie said he saw David near the broken window
4. David said he was with John at the time of the crime
5. Bob said he was with Alice at the time of the crime
6. Alice said she was with Charlie at the time of the crime
7. Charlie said he was alone at the time of the crime
8. John said he saw David near the crime scene
9. David said he was with Bob at the time of the crime
10. Bob said he was with Charlie at the time of the crime
11. Charlie said he saw Alice near the crime scene

The security camera footage (evidence 2) and Charlie's testimony (testimony 3) contradict each other because the footage might have shown David near the broken window, but Charlie said he saw David near the broken window, which implies Charlie was also near the window.

Given the story, "The crime occurred at night, and the perpetrator was seen entering through a window. John was seen near the scene, and he said he was with David at the time of the crime. David said he was with John, but he also said he was with Bob at the time of the crime. Bob said he was with Charlie at the time of the crime."

10. Bob said he was with Charlie at the time of the crime
11. Charlie said he saw Alice near the crime scene

The broken window (evidence 2) and David's testimony (testimony 3) contradict each other because the broken window suggests the perpetrator entered through it, but David said he saw David near the broken window, which implies the perpetrator was someone else.

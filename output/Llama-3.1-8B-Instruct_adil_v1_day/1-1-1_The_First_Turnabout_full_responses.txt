To determine which evidence/character and testimony contradict each other, I would need to analyze the information provided.

Assuming the lists are as follows:

Characters: 
1. John
2. Alice
3. Bob
4. Charlie
5. David

Evidences: 
1. A torn piece of fabric
2. A suspicious letter
3. A security camera footage
4. A fingerprint
5. A broken window

Testimonies: 
1. John saw Alice near the crime scene
2. Alice heard Bob arguing with Charlie
3. Charlie saw David near the broken window
4. David said he was with John at the time of the crime
5. Bob said he was with Alice at the time of the crime
6. Alice said she was with Charlie at the time of the crime
7. Charlie said he was alone at the time of the crime
8. John said he saw David near the crime scene
9. David said he was with Bob at the time of the crime
10. Bob said he was with Charlie at the time of the crime
11. Charlie said he saw Alice near the crime scene

Without the story, it's difficult to determine which evidence/character and testimony contradict each other.

However, based on the information provided, one possible pair that contradicts each other is:

{"character": 3, "testimony": 11}
Given the story, "The crime occurred at night, and the perpetrator was seen entering through a window. The next morning, a suspicious letter was found near the scene with a torn piece of fabric attached to it. Alice heard Bob arguing with Charlie earlier that day, and Charlie saw David near the broken window. David said he was with John at the time of the crime, but John said he was alone at the time. Bob said he was with Alice at the time of the crime, but Alice said she was with Charlie."

Assuming the lists are as follows:

Characters: 
1. John
2. Alice
3. Bob
4. Charlie
5. David

Evidences: 
1. A torn piece of fabric
2. A suspicious letter
3. A security camera footage
4. A fingerprint
5. A broken window

Testimonies: 
1. John saw Alice near the crime scene
2. Alice heard Bob arguing with Charlie
3. Charlie saw David near the broken window
4. David said he was with John at the time of the crime
5. Bob said he was with Alice at the time of the crime
6. Alice said she was with Charlie at the time of the crime
7. Charlie said he was alone at the time of the crime
8. John said he saw David near the crime scene
9. David said he was with Bob at the time of the crime
10. Bob said he was with Charlie at the time of the crime
11. Charlie said he saw Alice near the crime scene

The suspicious letter (evidence 2) and Charlie's testimony (testimony 3) contradict each other because the letter suggests the perpetrator entered through the window, but Charlie's testimony implies David was near the window, not necessarily the perpetrator.

{"evidence": 2, "testimony": 3}
Given the story, "The crime occurred at night, and the perpetrator was seen entering through a broken window. John was seen near the scene, and he said he was with David at the time of the crime. David said he was with John, but he also said he saw Charlie near the broken window. Charlie said he was alone at the time of the crime."

Assuming the lists are as follows:

Characters: 
1. John
2. Alice
3. Bob
4. Charlie
5. David

Evidences: 
1. A torn piece of fabric
2. A broken window
3. A security camera footage
4. A fingerprint
5. A suspicious letter

Testimonies: 
1. John saw Alice near the crime scene
2. Alice heard Bob arguing with Charlie
3. Charlie saw David near the broken window
4. David said he was with John at the time of the crime
5. Bob said he was with Alice at the time of the crime
6. Alice said she was with Charlie at the time of the crime
7. Charlie said he was alone at the time of the crime
8. John said he saw David near the crime scene
9. David said he was with Bob at the time of the crime
10. Bob said he was with Charlie at the time of the crime
11. Charlie said he saw Alice near the crime scene

The broken window (evidence 2) and Charlie's testimony (testimony 7) contradict each other because the broken window suggests someone entered through it, but Charlie said he was alone at the time of the crime.

{"evidence": 2, "testimony": 7}

Okay, so I need to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let me start by going through each piece of evidence and testimony one by one, trying to see where they clash.

First, looking at the testimonies from Gumshoe. Testimony 0 says he secured the suspect and examined the crime scene. Testimony 1 mentions finding a memo next to the victim. Testimony 2 says the memo had "Maya" written in blood. Testimony 3 adds that the blood was the victim's. Testimony 4 notes blood on the victim's finger, and Testimony 5 says the victim wrote the killer's name before dying.

Now, looking at the evidence. Evidence 1 is the Thinker, which is the murder weapon—a clock made by Larry Butz. Evidence 4 is a receipt with blood letters, and Evidence 6 is Maya's cell phone with a conversation between the Chief and Maya. Evidence 7 is a wiretap from May's hotel room, and Evidence 12 is Bellboy's affidavit about a man staying with May.

I remember that in the story, Maya is the suspect, but she's actually innocent. The real killer is Redd White. So, the testimonies from Gumshoe might be conflicting with the evidence because he's testifying based on what he saw, but the truth is different.

Wait, Testimony 5 says the victim wrote the killer's name. If the victim is Maya, she might have written Redd's name, but if Gumshoe is testifying that she wrote the killer's name, that would mean he's saying she's guilty. But in reality, she's innocent, so that testimony is false. 

Looking at the evidence, Evidence 6 (Maya's cell phone) has a conversation where she talks about the DL-6 incident with her sister. This might tie into Testimony 5, where she wrote the killer's name. Maybe the conversation on her phone is where she recorded it, which is linked to the memo mentioned in Testimony 1. So, the memo she found (Evidence 4) has letters written in blood, which might be the same as what she wrote on her phone.

Wait, but if the killer is Redd, then the blood on the receipt (Evidence 4) would be his, not Maya's. So, Testimony 3 says the blood was the victim's, which would be false if the victim is innocent. That means Testimony 3 contradicts Evidence 4.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to map it out. If Maya is innocent, then the blood on the receipt (Evidence 4) should belong to the killer, Redd. But Testimony 3 says it's the victim's blood, which would be wrong because the victim is Mia, not Maya. Wait, no—the victim is Maya. Wait, no, the victim is Mia? Or is the victim Maya? Wait, in the story, Mia is the Chief Attorney, and Maya is her sister. The murder happened to Mia, right? Because Maya was found over her body, crying.

So, Mia was the victim. So, the blood on the receipt (Evidence 4) would be Mia's blood. But if Redd killed Mia, then the blood on the receipt should be his, not Mia's. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, no. If Redd killed Mia, then the blood on the receipt (Evidence 4) would be Mia's, which was written on the receipt. But Testimony 3 says the blood was the victim's, which would be correct because the victim is Mia. So, that's not a contradiction.

Wait, but in the testimonies, the victim is Maya, but in reality, the victim is Mia. So, that's a big contradiction. So, Testimony 0 says he secured the suspect, but the suspect is actually innocent. Testimony 1 mentions the memo next to the victim, but if the victim is Mia, then the memo would be Mia's, not Maya's.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to outline the key points:

- The victim is Mia, not Maya.
- The killer is Redd White.
- Maya is innocent, found over Mia's body, but she's just a witness.

So, in the testimonies, Gumshoe is testifying that he found the memo with "Maya" written in blood. But the memo is actually Mia's, because the victim is Mia. So, the memo should have Mia's name, not Maya's. Therefore, Testimony 2 is wrong because it says "Maya" when it should be "Mia".

Wait, but in the evidence, Evidence 4 is the receipt with blood letters, which might be the same as the memo. So, the receipt and memo both have blood with names, but if the victim is Mia, then it's her blood, and the names should be Mia's, not Maya's. So, Testimony 2 is wrong because it says "Maya", not "Mia".

But the testimonies are from Gumshoe, who is the detective. He's testifying that he found "Maya" written in blood on the memo. That's a contradiction because the victim is Mia, so the memo should have Mia's name, not Maya's.

So, the evidence (Evidence 4 and 1, the Thinker) and testimonies (Testimony 2, 3) are conflicting. Testimony 2 says "Maya" in blood on the memo, but the memo should have Mia's name, making Testimony 2 false.

Alternatively, looking at the testimonies, Testimony 5 says the victim wrote the killer's name before dying. If the victim is Mia, and the killer is Redd, then the memo should have Redd's name. But Testimony 2 says "Maya", which is wrong.

Wait, but in the evidence, Evidence 6 is Maya's cell phone with a conversation between Mia and Maya. So, maybe the memo on the receipt (Evidence 4) is actually from Maya, but she's innocent. So, the blood on the receipt is hers, but she didn't kill Mia. So, Testimony 3 is correct because the blood is the victim's (Mia's), but Testimony 2 is wrong because it says "Maya" instead of "Mia".

Therefore, Testimony 2 contradicts Evidence 4 because the memo should have Mia's name, not Maya's.

Alternatively, Testimony 5 says the victim wrote the killer's name, which would be Redd. So, the memo should have Redd's name, but Testimony 2 says "Maya", which is wrong. So, Testimony 2 and Testimony 5 both contradict Evidence 4.

But the question asks for one pair. So, the main contradiction is between Testimony 2 and Evidence 4 because the memo should have Mia's name, not Maya's. Therefore, Testimony 2 is wrong, and Evidence 4 supports that the blood is the victim's (Mia's), which is correct, but Testimony 2's content is wrong.

So, the pair is Testimony 2 and Evidence 4.

{"evidence": 4, "testimony": 2}
Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking which evidence or character contradicts a testimony in this case. They provided a lot of information about characters, evidences, and testimonies. I need to find a pair where one evidence or character directly contradicts a testimony.

First, I'll go through the testimonies. Testimony 4 says that April saw Maya hit the victim with "that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? 'The Thinker,' I think?" So, she's identifying the murder weapon as The Thinker, which is Evidence 1. But wait, Evidence 1 is The Thinker, which is the murder weapon. However, Testimony 3 from Gumshoe says he found a memo next to the victim's body with the word "Maya" written in blood. But wait, no, that's not the contradiction yet.

Wait, let me check. Testimony 4 is from April, and she's pointing out the clock as the weapon. But in the evidences, Evidence 1 is The Thinker, which is the clock. So, if April is testifying that she saw Maya hit the victim with the clock, that aligns with Evidence 1 being the murder weapon. But I'm not sure if that's a contradiction yet.

Looking at the other testimonies, Testimony 3 is from Gumshoe, saying he found blood on the victim's finger. But that's from Evidence 4, which is Maya's Memo. Wait, no, Evidence 4 is Maya's Memo, which is a conversation. Maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no, Evidence 4 is Maya's Memo, which is a conversation on her cell phone. Testimony 3 says that the lab test showed the blood was the victim's, but that's from Gumshoe's testimony, which is separate. I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, the user's previous interaction had a JSON answer of {"evidence":4, "testimony":2}, but I need to figure out why. Evidence 4 is Maya's Memo, and Testimony 2 is from Gumshoe, who found the memo with "Maya" in blood. So, that's a contradiction because Maya's Memo was found, but the memo is supposed to be on her cell phone. Wait, no, the memo is a conversation on her cell phone, but the testimony says it was found next to the body. So that's a contradiction.

Wait, in the current query, Testimony 4 is April saying she saw Maya hit the victim with The Thinker, which is Evidence 1. But Testimony 3 from Gumshoe says he found a memo with "Maya" in blood. That's a different testimony. So, maybe the contradiction is between Evidence 1 and Testimony 4, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, the user's previous answer was {"evidence":4, "testimony":2}, which suggests that Evidence 4 (Maya's Memo) contradicts Testimony 2 (Gumshoe finding the memo). Because Testimony 2 says he found the memo next to the body, but the memo is on Maya's cell phone, so that's a contradiction.

In this current query, the user is asking again, so maybe the same pair is still the contradiction. So, the answer would be {"evidence":4, "testimony":2} again.

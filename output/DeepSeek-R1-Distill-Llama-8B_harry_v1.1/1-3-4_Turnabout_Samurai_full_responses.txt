Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence or character contradicts which testimony in this scenario. Let's take it step by step. 

First, I need to understand the setup. There's a murder at Global Studios involving Will Powers, the defendant, and Jack Hammer, the victim. The story is set around the time of the Steel Samurai TV show, which adds some context about the characters and their roles.

Looking at the characters, we have:
- **Maya Fey**: Mia's sister, training to be a spirit medium.
- **Miles Edgeworth**: A ruthless prosecutor.
- **Dick Gumshoe**: The detective in charge.
- **Will Powers**: The defendant, an action star famous for Steel Samurai.
- **Security Lady**: A guard who claims she saw Powers heading to the scene.
- **Jack Hammer**: The victim, a former big action star.
- **Assistant Penny Nichols**: Handles large props.
- **Sal Manella**: The director and creator of Steel Samurai.
- **Cody Hackins**: A fan of Steel Samurai who was at the studio that day.
- **Dee Vasquez**: A high-ranking producer present on the day of the crime.

Now, the evidence list includes things like the Attorney's Badge, Powers's Letter, Guidemap, Autopsy Report, and so on. The testimonies are mainly from **Oldbag**, who is probably the Security Lady, talking about seeing Powers at the gate before the murder.

The testimonies from **Cody** are about him seeing the Steel Samurai rehearsal and his own observations that day. However, since Cody is a fan, his testimonies might be more about what he saw as a fan rather than as an objective witness.

Looking at the testimonies:

- **Testimony 0**: Cody wanted to see a Steel Samurai rehearsal.
- **Testimony 1**: He found a map online and went to the studio.
- **Testimony 2**: He went off the path to avoid the guard.
- **Testimony 3**: He was going to the studio.
- **Testimony 4**: He got lost for about 30 minutes.
- **Testimony 5**: He saw the Steel Samurai.
- **Testimony 6**: The Steel Samurai fought the bad guy.
- **Testimony 7**: He would have taken a photo if he had his camera.

Now, looking at the evidence:

- **Evidence 5**: A photo at the gate showing Steel Samurai walking at 2:00 PM.
- **Evidence 3**: Jack's Autopsy Report at 2:30 PM.

The contradiction seems to be between Cody's testimony about seeing the Steel Samurai at 2:00 PM and the photo evidence that shows Steel Samurai was at the gate at 2:00 PM, while the murder happened at 2:30 PM. This suggests that Cody might have seen Powers (as Steel Samurai) at 2:00 PM, but the actual murder was at 2:30 PM, meaning Powers couldn't have been at both places at the same time.

So, the evidence (Evidence 5 and Evidence 3) and testimony (Testimony 6) contradict each other because the photo shows Powers was at the gate at 2:00 PM, but the autopsy shows the murder happened at 2:30 PM, making it impossible for Powers to be at both places simultaneously. Therefore, Cody's testimony that he saw Powers at 2:00 PM doesn't align with the timeline provided by the evidence.

But wait, the testimonies are from Cody, and he's a fan, so he might have misremembered the exact time or confused the rehearsal with the actual crime. However, the evidence clearly shows the timeline, so there's a contradiction between Cody's testimony and the evidence.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence or character contradicts a testimony in this scenario. The story involves a murder at Global Studios, with Will Powers as the defendant and Jack Hammer as the victim. There are several characters, evidences, and testimonies to consider.

First, I need to understand the key points from the testimonies. Cody Hackins is a big fan of "The Steel Samurai," which is the show Will Powers stars in. Cody was at the studio that day and saw the Steel Samurai in action. He took his camera but missed capturing the best shot because the lens didn't open in time.

Now, looking at the evidence, there's a "Cody's Camera" which he always carries. It's mentioned that he's still learning how to use it. This seems relevant because Cody's testimony about trying to take a photo with his camera could be contradicted by the evidence about the camera's condition or his ability to use it.

I also need to check if any other evidence ties into this. There's a "Steak Plate" with traces of sleeping pills and a bone, suggesting that someone had a meal there, possibly around the time of the crime. This might indicate that someone else was at the scene, but I'm not sure how it ties into Cody's testimony.

The "Samurai Spear" was found stuck in Jack Hammer's chest, confirming that it was the murder weapon. The "Empty Bottle" or "Sleeping Pill Bottle" adds to the timeline, showing that there were sleeping pills at the scene, possibly indicating that the killer used them to knock out the victim.

Now, focusing on Cody's testimony, he mentioned that he tried to take a photo but the camera's lens didn't open in time. The "Cody's Camera" evidence suggests he was there with a camera, but if he's still learning, maybe he didn't have the skills to use it effectively, or the camera had issues. This could mean he wasn't actually able to take any photos, contradicting his testimony about trying to take shots.

Alternatively, the "Steak Plate" evidence might indicate that someone else was at the scene, which could mean Cody wasn't the only one there, but that doesn't directly contradict his testimony about the camera.

Considering all this, the most straightforward contradiction seems to be between the "Cody's Camera" evidence and his testimony about using it to take photos. If the camera was with him but he couldn't use it properly, his claim of trying to take a photo might not hold up.

So, the evidence that contradicts the testimony is Evidence 15 ("Cody's Camera") and Testimony 2 ("Testimony: So I held up my camera to take a picture! Person: Cody").

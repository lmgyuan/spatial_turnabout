Alright, I'm trying to figure out which evidence or character contradicts a testimony in this scenario. Let me start by going through the details provided.

First, I see that there are several characters involved, including Maya Fey, Dick Gumshoe, Franziska von Karma, Max, and others. The story seems to revolve around a murder at the Berry Big Circus, with Russell Berry being the victim.

Looking at the testimonies, they're all from Trilo Quist, the ventriloquist's puppet. He talks about having an engagement ring he wanted to give to Regina Berry. He mentions keeping it in his pocket and not being able to give it to her, ending up with it still in his pocket.

Now, looking at the evidence, I notice the Evidence 12 is a Wooden Box that the victim was hunched over. Inside, there's a Small Seasoning Bottle with pepper. Evidence 17 is a Scarf belonging to Bat, stained with his blood and pepper. Evidence 14 is a Note that says "To The Murderer!" torn from the cafeteria on the day of the crime.

Putting this together, Trilo's testimony suggests he was holding onto the engagement ring, but the evidence points towards the murder involving pepper and a scarf with Bat's blood. This implies that the murderer might have used pepper as a distraction or weapon, possibly targeting Bat, not Trilo. Therefore, Trilo's testimony about the ring doesn't align with the evidence related to the murder weapon and the victim's injuries.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out which piece of evidence or character testimony contradicts each other in this scenario. Let's see what we have here.

First, the characters involved are Maya Fey, Dick Gumshoe, Franziska von Karma, Max, Regina Berry, Russell Berry, Ben, Moe, Acro, Bat, Trilo Quist, Money the Monkey, and LÃ©on. The main suspect seems to be Max, a famous magician, based on the evidence and testimonies.

Looking at the evidences, there's the Crime Photo showing the crime scene with footprints leading to the victim. The Silk Hat and Promo Poster both belong to Max, indicating he was at the scene. The Broken Bottle found on the cafeteria floor suggests that someone was there, possibly Max. The Wooden Box with pepper inside and the Small Seasoning Bottle add to the timeline, showing that Russell was hunched over the box, which was locked. The Note left at the crime scene says "To The Murderer!" which points towards Max. The Stage Costume doesn't fit Maya, so it's likely not hers. The Scarf belonging to Bat has pepper and blood, indicating he was there too.

Now, the testimonies from Moe all point towards Max being the murderer. Moe saw Max's symbols, his hat and cloak, and was certain it was him despite the distance. However, the evidence about the Wooden Box and pepper suggests that Russell was hunched over it, possibly indicating he was alive after the incident. This contradicts the autopsy report stating blunt force trauma as the cause of death.

Wait, but the testimonies from Moe are about seeing Max at the crime scene, while the evidence shows Russell was alive after the incident. This means that Max couldn't have killed Russell because Russell was still alive, which contradicts the testimonies supporting Max as the murderer. Therefore, the evidence about the Wooden Box and pepper being found on Russell after the crime contradicts Moe's testimony that Max was the one who killed him.

So, the contradiction is between the evidence (Evidence 12: Wooden Box and Evidence 13: Small Seasoning Bottle with pepper) and Moe's testimonies (Testimony 0-4). The evidence shows Russell was alive after the incident, but Moe's testimonies suggest Max killed him.

{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 0}
Alright, I need to figure out which evidence or character contradicts a testimony in this case. Let's start by looking at the testimonies and see what they say. 

Testimony 0 says, "There's no doubt in my mind! There were no white roses that night!" from Moe. So Moe is stating that there were no white roses present at the crime scene.

Now, looking at the evidence, Evidence 4 is the Max G. Promo Poster, which is described as having Max's three famous symbols: a silk hat, cloak, and white roses. This poster was found at the crime scene. 

If Moe is testifying that there were no white roses, but the evidence shows that the poster with white roses was found, that creates a contradiction. Moe's testimony would be false if the poster indeed had white roses.

Therefore, the evidence that contradicts the testimony is Evidence 4, and the testimony is Testimony 0.

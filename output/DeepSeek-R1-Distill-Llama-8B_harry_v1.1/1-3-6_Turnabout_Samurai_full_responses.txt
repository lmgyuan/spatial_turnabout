Alright, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this scenario. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

First, I need to understand the characters and the evidence provided. The main characters involved are:

- **Maya Fey**: Mia's little sister, training to become a spirit medium.
- **Miles Edgeworth**: A tough prosecutor who wants to win at all costs.
- **Dick Gumshoe**: A detective leading the initial investigation.
- **Will Powers**: The defendant, an action star known as "The Steel Samurai."
- **Security Lady**: A security guard who claims she saw Powers heading to the scene.
- **Jack Hammer**: The victim, a former big action star.
- **Assistant (Penny Nichols)**: In charge of large props and set pieces at Global Studios.
- **The Director (Sal Manella)**: Creator of "The Steel Samurai," present on the day of the crime.
- **Cody Hackins**: A big fan of "The Steel Samurai," present at the studio on the day of the crime.
- **Dee Vasquez**: A high-ranking producer at Global Studios, present on the day of the crime.

Now, looking at the **evidences**:

1. **Attorney's Badge**: Used to establish Mia as a defense attorney.
2. **Powers's Letter**: Proves Will Powers requested an attorney.
3. **Guidemap**: Map of Global Studios.
4. **Jack's Autopsy Report**: Details Jack Hammer's time of death and cause.
5. **Cardkey**: Access to Studio One.
6. **Powers' Photo**: Shows Powers at the studio gate around 2:00 PM.
7. **Samurai Spear**: Found stuck in Jack's chest.
8. **Empty Bottle (Sleeping Pill)**: Found near the employee area.
9. **Trailer Key**: Key to Studio Two Trailer.
10. **Vasquez's Memo**: Request for Episode 13 script.
11. **Script**: Steel Samurai script for Episode 13.
12. **Mr. Monkey's Head**: Blocked the crime scene path between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM.
13. **Steel Samurai Card**: A collectible trading card.
14. **URP Card**: Valuable collectible card.
15. **Path to Glory**: Photos of Steel Samurai victories.
16. **Cody's Camera**: A new digital camera Cody uses.
17. **Steak Plate**: Found with sleeping pills and a bone.
18. **Five-Year-Old Photo**: Shows an accident involving Jack Hammer.
19. **Van**: Used by Manella to drive Vasquez to Studio One.

Now, the **testimonies**:

- **Testimony 0**: Vasquez says she entered the trailer a bit before noon, meeting started at 12:00 PM, ended at 4:00 PM, then they went to Studio One, and took a 15-minute break at 2:30 PM.
- **Testimony 1**: Vasquez confirms the meeting went until 4:00 PM.
- **Testimony 2**: Vasquez mentions a rehearsal after the meeting at Studio One.
- **Testimony 3**: Vasquez was fatigued, so Sal took her.
- **Testimony 4**: During the meeting, they took a 15-minute break at 2:30 PM.
- **Testimony 5**: They ate t-bone steaks at the trailer table.

Now, to find contradictions between evidence and testimony. Let's focus on **Testimony 5**: Vasquez says they ate t-bone steaks on the table in front of the trailer during the meeting break at 2:30 PM.

Looking at the **evidence**, **Evidence 7** is the Empty Bottle (Sleeping Pill Bottle) found on a table in the employee area. **Evidence 16** is the Steak Plate found with traces of sleeping pills and a bone.

If Vasquez and others were eating t-bone steaks at the trailer during the break, that would imply the Steak Plate and Empty Bottle should be at the trailer, not in the employee area. However, the evidence shows these items were found in the employee area, suggesting the actual location of the break might have been elsewhere, contradicting Vasquez's testimony about the location of their meal.

Therefore, **Evidence 16 (Steak Plate)** and **Evidence 7 (Empty Bottle)** contradict **Testimony 5**, as the items were found in the employee area, not at the trailer where the break supposedly occurred.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence or character contradicts a testimony in this case. Let's see, the story involves a murder at Global Studios, and there are several characters and pieces of evidence to consider. 

First, I need to understand the key elements involved. The victim is Jack Hammer, a former big action star who played the Evil Magistrate. The defendant is Will Powers, known for his role as the Steel Samurai. There's also a group of characters like the Security Lady, the Assistant, the Director, and Dee Vasquez, a high-ranking producer who was present on the day of the crime.

Looking at the testimonies, Testimony 5 says that Vasquez went back to the trailer to get her script and direction notes after the police arrived. Testimony 7 adds that she left some action scenes behind because Hammer was injured. 

Now, looking at the evidence, Evidence 16 is a steak plate found in the employee area with traces of sleeping pills and a large bone. This suggests that someone had eaten steak, possibly indicating that Vasquez and Manella had a meal there.

So, the contradiction seems to be between Testimony 5 and Evidence 16. Testimony 5 says Vasquez went back to the trailer after the police arrived, implying she didn't have time to eat. However, Evidence 16 shows that she had a steak plate with sleeping pills, which indicates she did have time to eat, contradicting her testimony.

Therefore, the pair that contradicts each other is Evidence 16 and Testimony 5.

Alright, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this scenario. So, from the given information, we have a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. The story revolves around the DL-6 Incident, involving several key characters like Miles Edgeworth, Dick Gumshoe, and Larry Butz. 

Looking at the testimonies, we see that Miles Edgeworth is testifying about an event where an object fell at his feet, he threw it at Yogi, and then a gunshot and scream occurred. Specifically, Testimony 3 says he picked up a heavy object and threw it, while Testimony 5 mentions a single gunshot followed by a scream.

Now, looking at the evidences, Evidence 18 mentions that the murder weapon was fired twice, and Evidence 19 notes a bullet hole in the door. This suggests that there were two gunshots, not one. 

So, the contradiction arises because Edgeworth's testimony mentions only one gunshot, but the evidence indicates there were two. This inconsistency suggests that the testimonies and evidence contradict each other.

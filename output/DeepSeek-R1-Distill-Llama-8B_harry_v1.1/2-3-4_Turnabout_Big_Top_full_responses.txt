Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence or character contradicts a testimony in this story. Let me start by reading through all the information given.

First, the characters: There's Maya Fey, who's an assistant and a spirit medium. Then there's Dick Gumshoe, a detective. Franziska von Karma is a prosecutor from Germany. Max is a magician accused of murder. Regina Berry is the daughter of the Ringmaster, Russell Berry, who was the victim. Ben is a ventriloquist, Moe is a clown friend of the Ringmaster, Acro is an acrobat, and Bat is injured after being hit by a lion.

Now, the evidences: There's an Attorney's Badge, Maya's Magatama, a Crime Photo showing footprints, a Silk Hat found at the scene, a Promo Poster with Max's symbols, Ringmaster's Papers, a Circus Map, a Broken Bottle, Trilo Quist, Money the Monkey, a Ring, Russell's Autopsy Report, a Wooden Box, a Small Seasoning Bottle, Grand Prix Photo, Max G. Bust, a Note, Stage Costume, LÃ©on, and Scarf.

The testimonies are from Moe, talking about seeing Max at the crime scene with his symbols, like the Silk Hat and cloak, and white roses. He's confident it was Max.

Looking at the testimonies, Moe is pretty sure it was Max because of the symbols he saw. But the evidence related to Max includes the Promo Poster, which has the silk hat, cloak, and white roses. The Silk Hat was found at the crime scene, and the Promo Poster was at the Award Ceremony with the bust nearby.

Now, the question is which evidence or character contradicts a testimony. The user mentioned that the answer should be a JSON with "evidence" and "testimony" numbers.

So, Moe's testimonies (0-4) all support that Max was at the crime scene with his symbols. But the evidence shows that the Promo Poster was at the Award Ceremony, not the crime scene. The Silk Hat was found at the crime scene, but the Promo Poster with all three symbols (silk hat, cloak, white roses) was at the Award Ceremony. This might mean that while the Silk Hat was present, the full set of symbols (from the Promo Poster) wasn't at the crime scene.

Wait, but the Promo Poster is evidence 4, and Moe is testifying about seeing the symbols (silk hat, cloak, white roses) at the crime scene. If the Promo Poster was at the Award Ceremony, then maybe the symbols were elsewhere. Or perhaps the Promo Poster was taken down, and the symbols were only partially present.

Alternatively, maybe the evidence about the Promo Poster being at the Award Ceremony contradicts Moe's testimony that all symbols were present at the crime scene. So, if the Promo Poster wasn't there, maybe the full set of symbols wasn't present either, contradicting Moe's testimony.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the key is that the Promo Poster was at the Award Ceremony, not the crime scene, so the presence of the symbols at the crime scene is in question. Therefore, the evidence (Promo Poster) contradicts Moe's testimony about seeing all three symbols at the crime scene.

So, the pair would be evidence 4 (Max G. Promo Poster) and testimony 0-4 (Moe's testimonies).

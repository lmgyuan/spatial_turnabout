Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm going to go through each testimony and evidence to see where they contradict each other. 

First, I'll list out all the testimonies and the corresponding evidence to check for any discrepancies.

Testimony 0: "On the day of the murder, I arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM." (Person: Oldbag)
Testimony 1: "Poor old Hammer and the rest had been doing a run-through there since the morning." (Person: Oldbag)
Testimony 2: "I, well, I had some errands to run that morning." (Person: Oldbag)
Testimony 3: "Anyway, it was 1:00 when I got to the guard station." (Person: Oldbag)
Testimony 4: "I was at the main gate from then until 5:00!" (Person: Oldbag)
Testimony 5: "Now, the murder happened at 2:30 PM, right?" (Person: Oldbag)
Testimony 6: "Interesting to me, because a certain man walked right by me at 2:00 PM." (Person: Oldbag)
Testimony 7: "It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!" (Person: Oldbag)

Now, looking at the evidence, specifically Evidence 5: Jack's Autopsy Report, which states the time of death was 10/15 at 2:30 PM. 

Now, let's analyze the testimonies:

- Testimony 5 directly states that the murder happened at 2:30 PM, which aligns with Evidence 5.
- Testimony 6 mentions that a man (Powers) walked by at 2:00 PM, which is 30 minutes before the murder. This seems contradictory because Powers was supposed to be at the scene of the crime at 2:30 PM, not 30 minutes earlier.

Therefore, Testimony 6 contradicts Evidence 5 because it places Powers at the scene half an hour before the murder, which doesn't fit with the autopsy report.

So, the pair that contradicts is Testimony 6 and Evidence 5.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence or character contradicts which testimony in this scenario. Let me start by reading through all the information provided carefully. 

First, I see that there are characters involved in this case: Maya Fey, Miles Edgeworth, Dick Gumshoe, Will Powers, the Security Lady, Jack Hammer, Penny Nichols, Sal Manella, Cody Hackins, and Dee Vasquez. Each has their own description, which might help in understanding their roles.

Then, there are the evidences listed. I need to go through each one and see what they relate to. For example, Evidence 5 is Powers's Photo, taken at the gate showing the Steel Samurai walking at 2:00 PM. Evidence 3 is Jack's Autopsy Report, showing he died at 2:30 PM from a spear. So, there's a time difference hereâ€”about half an hour between the photo and the murder.

Now, looking at the testimonies, Testimony 0 says, "The time of poor Hammer's death was 2:30 PM, true?" and Testimony 1 says, "The only person I saw go to the studio before then was Will Powers!" and Testimony 2 adds, "No one else went there!" and Testimony 3 confirms, "If they had, I would have seen them!"

So, the testimonies are from someone named Oldbag, who was at the guard station from 1:00 PM until 5:00 PM. They saw Will Powers going into the studio at around 2:00 PM, based on the photo. But the murder happened at 2:30 PM, which is after this time. So, if Powers was already inside the studio by 2:00 PM, how could he have committed the murder at 2:30 PM? Unless he was already inside before the photo was taken.

Wait, but the photo was taken at 2:00 PM, showing Powers heading toward the studio. So, if he was already inside by that time, he could have been there before the photo. That would mean he was already inside the studio before 2:00 PM, which would make the timeline fit. So, maybe the testimonies don't contradict the evidence after all.

But then, Testimony 3 says, "If they had, I would have seen them!" implying that if anyone else had gone in, Oldbag would have seen them. But since only Powers went in, it's consistent. So, maybe there's no contradiction here.

Alternatively, maybe the issue is with the Security Lady, who is character 4. She claims she saw Powers heading to the scene, but if the testimonies from Oldbag are accurate, that might not be the case. But I'm not sure if that's the pair the system is looking for.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between Evidence 5 (the photo showing Powers at 2:00 PM) and the autopsy report at 2:30 PM. If Powers was entering the studio at 2:00 PM, and the murder happened at 2:30 PM, that gives him enough time to commit the crime. So, maybe the testimonies are supporting the evidence, not contradicting.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the contradiction is between the testimonies and the evidence in terms of who was present. But based on the information, it seems like the testimonies align with the evidence. So, maybe there's no direct contradiction here.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check again. Evidence 5 shows Powers entering the studio at 2:00 PM, and the murder happens at 2:30 PM. That gives Powers enough time to commit the murder. So, the testimonies support the evidence, not contradict them. Therefore, there's no contradiction between Evidence 5 and Testimony 6.

Maybe I need to look elsewhere. Is there another pair that contradicts? For example, Testimony 1 says only Powers went there, but maybe another character also went there, which is not mentioned. But based on the given information, I don't see that.

Alternatively, maybe the issue is with the timing. If the photo was taken at 2:00 PM, and the murder was at 2:30 PM, that's a half-hour window. But that seems consistent, not contradictory.

Perhaps I'm supposed to see that the testimonies are from Oldbag, but the photo is from someone else, leading to inconsistencies. But the testimonies are all from Oldbag, so that might not be it.

I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe the answer is that there's no direct contradiction between Evidence 5 and Testimony 6, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the Security Lady's testimony contradicts something else, but I don't have enough information.

I think I'll go with the initial thought that there's no contradiction between Evidence 5 and Testimony 6, as they seem to support each other. Maybe the correct answer is that they don't contradict each other.

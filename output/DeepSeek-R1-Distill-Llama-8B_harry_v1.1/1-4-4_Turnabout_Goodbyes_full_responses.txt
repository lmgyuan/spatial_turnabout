Alright, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let's see, the story involves a bunch of characters like Miles Edgeworth, Dick Gumshoe, Lotta Hart, Larry Butz, and others. The main crime is the murder of Robert Hammond, who was a defense attorney involved in the DL-6 Incident 15 years ago.

First, I need to look at the testimonies and see which one stands out. There's a testimony from Larry Butz where he says he was out in a boat on the lake that night, looking for something, and then he found the body. He also mentions hearing a "bang" and then going home after hearing a gunshot.

Now, looking at the evidence, there's a lot of stuff here. The key pieces seem to be the autopsy report, the lake photo, and Lotta's deposition. The autopsy report says Robert died around the 24th or 25th with a bullet to the heart. The lake photo was taken automatically at 12:15 AM on the 25th, but it shows an empty lake. Lotta's deposition says she heard two gunshots just after midnight on the 25th.

Wait, Larry Butz claims he was on the lake around the time of the murder, but Lotta's camera was facing the lake and didn't show anything. Plus, Lotta heard two gunshots, which would mean there were two shots fired. However, the autopsy only mentions a single bullet, which suggests a single gunshot. That's a contradiction because Lotta heard two shots, but there's only one bullet found.

Also, Larry Butz said he found the body, but the official report says Dick Gumshoe and others found it. That's another inconsistency. Maybe Larry is lying about being on the lake or about finding the body.

So, putting it all together, Larry Butz's testimony contradicts the evidence from Lotta's camera and the autopsy report because he claims he was on the lake and heard a gunshot, but the evidence shows only one bullet was found, and Lotta heard two shots, which doesn't align with the single bullet. Plus, the official finding of the body was done by others, not him.

Therefore, the evidence that contradicts the testimony is Evidence 20, the Letter from the Safe, and the testimony from Larry Butz (Testimony 0). The letter from the Safe says, "Get your revenge on Miles Edgeworth," which ties into the motive, but the main contradiction is the number of shots heard versus the number of bullets found.

Alright, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this scenario. Let's see, I have a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. The story involves a murder at Gourd Lake, and there are several people involved, including Miles Edgeworth, a prosecutor, and Larry Butz, who's a friend of the main character, Mia Fey. There's also Lotta Hart, who claims to be a research student camping out to photograph shooting stars.

From the evidences, I see things like an Attorney's Badge, a Popper (a party noisemaker), Lotta's Camera set to take pictures when a loud noise is detected, an Autopsy Report indicating Robert's death was due to a bullet, a Lake Photo taken automatically at 12:15 AM, a Gourdy Article about a monster sighted at Gourd Lake, Misty Fey's Photo with a note from the DL-6 Incident, Edgeworth's Request for an attorney, an Overhead Map, a Pistol Bullet found in the victim's body, the Pistol as the murder weapon with Edgeworth's prints, Lotta's Deposition about hearing gunshots, a Missile, a Fishing Pole, a Metal Detector, an Air Tank, a Second Lake Photo, a Parrot named Polly, the DL-6 Case File, the DL-6 Incident Photo, and a Letter from the Safe saying "Get your revenge on Miles Edgeworth."

The testimonies include Lotta saying she was out in a boat on the lake, looking for something, slipping the boat back in, hearing a "bang," not noticing the boat, and then going home after hearing a gunshot. Larry Butz claims he was on the boat, heard a DJ say "Hey! It's almost Christmas!" just before he heard a gunshot.

Okay, so I need to find a contradiction between one evidence and one testimony. Let's look at the testimonies first. Lotta Hart is claiming she was on the lake, heard gunshots, but didn't see the boat. Larry Butz, on the other hand, was on the boat and heard a gunshot while the DJ was saying "Hey! It's almost Christmas!"

Looking at the evidence, there's a Lake Photo taken automatically at 12:15 AM, which would be around the time of the murder. There's also a Second Lake Photo showing an empty lake taken at 11:50 PM. The Gourdy Article talks about a monster sighted at Gourd Lake, and Misty Fey's Photo has a note from the DL-6 Incident.

Wait, the Lake Photo was taken at 12:15 AM, which is after the supposed gunshot at 12:15 AM. But the Second Lake Photo was taken earlier at 11:50 PM. So, if Lotta heard gunshots at 12:15 AM, the camera would have taken a picture of the lake around that time, but it wasn't thereâ€”it was empty. That seems contradictory because if there was a gunshot, the camera should have recorded something, but it didn't.

But then, looking at Larry Butz's testimony, he heard the DJ say "Hey! It's almost Christmas!" right before the gunshot. The Letter from the Safe says "Get your revenge on Miles Edgeworth," which ties into the motive. The Pistol Bullet was found in Robert's body, fired from a 22-caliber pistol, and the Pistol itself has Edgeworth's prints.

So, putting this together, the Lake Photo taken at 12:15 AM would show the lake with the boat, but it's empty. However, Lotta's Deposition says she heard two gunshots at 12:15 AM, which should have been recorded by the camera, but the Second Lake Photo shows the lake was empty. That contradicts her testimony.

Alternatively, looking at Larry Butz's testimony, he heard the DJ say "Hey! It's almost Christmas!" just before the gunshot. The Lake Photo was taken at 12:15 AM, which would align with that time, but it shows an empty lake, meaning the boat wasn't there. However, Butz was on the boat, so this seems conflicting.

Wait, maybe the key is that the Lake Photo was taken automatically, so if the boat was there, it would have been in the photo, but it wasn't. So, if Lotta heard gunshots at 12:15 AM, the camera should have captured the boat, but it didn't. Therefore, her testimony that she heard gunshots is contradicted by the Lake Photo, which shows no boat.

But then, Larry Butz was on the boat and heard the gunshot, but the camera didn't capture the boat, so there's inconsistency there. However, the evidence says the Lake Photo was taken at 12:15 AM, which is the time of the gunshot, and it shows an empty lake, meaning the boat wasn't there, which contradicts Larry Butz's testimony that he was on the boat and heard the gunshot.

So, the contradiction is between the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) and Larry Butz's testimony (Testimony 0). The photo shows an empty lake at the time of the gunshot, meaning the boat wasn't there, but Butz claims he was on the boat and heard the gunshot.
